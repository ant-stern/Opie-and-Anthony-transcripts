<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy, profane spoken-word poem filled with violent and misogynistic imagery and racial slurs, focusing on betrayal and revenge.  This was followed by a series of calls and in-studio conversations.  Comedian Bob Kelly engaged in a highly offensive and profane phone argument.  Dave Attell recounted his experiences on a USO tour in Iraq, including a mortar attack, and his appearance on *The Gong Show* with Jim Norton, who was also a guest. The discussion then veered into a news story about a drunk police officer shooting someone, sparking a heated debate.  The hosts and guests offered crass and insensitive opinions about a woman's plan to open a restaurant staffed by intellectually disabled individuals, further fueled by offensive listener calls.  Greg Giraldo briefly joined the show, discussing his past aspirations to be a lawyer. The entire segment was rife with profanity and offensive language.

The show continued with lawyer "Gerald" recounting his legal experiences, including representing Jeff Ross on a weapons charge involving a realistic fake gun.  The conversation shifted to Gerald's (alleged) involvement in the Vince Champ rape case, detailing Champ's seemingly likable persona, his post-rape prayer ritual, and the unusual circumstances of his arrest.  Ronnie B., a friend of Champ's, called in, further emphasizing Champ's likability and the disbelief surrounding his crimes.  Greg Giraldo described roasting Carrot Top, detailing Carrot Top's angry reaction.  The show then speculated on Dave Chappelle's departure from Comedy Central, focusing on a potentially awkward interaction with a white audience member and Bill Burr's (who called in and denied involvement, citing lawyer-client privilege) possible role. Chappelle's comments on Oprah about fame and racial biases in Hollywood were also discussed, along with the success and subsequent criticism of his show and the film *Speed 2*.

A discussion about a "seedy" pornographer facing lawsuits involving underage girls followed.  The hosts and a caller discussed the pornographer's wealth and the perceived naiveté of the women involved. A caller who flew on the pornographer's jet shared their preference for traveling with the film crew.  Doug Stanhope called in to discuss his book deal documenting his online entrapment of pedophiles, prompting a discussion on legal ramifications of online defamation.  A game ensued where the hosts, with the help of Brittany, guessed the occupation of in-studio guest Jay Moore (an actor). The Don Imus controversy was discussed, comparing it to other instances of controversial statements by celebrities.  Comedic bits and impressions, including a Tracy Morgan air guitar performance, were interspersed throughout the segment.

The show then discussed a man's hidden pornography collection, including a pornographic tape found in his daughter's Easy Bake Oven.  The conversation transitioned to *American Idol*, karaoke, and a recollection of a previous Tracy Morgan appearance.  Tracy Morgan joined the show in studio, discussing a paternity test dispute and joking about his physique. Listener calls touched on sexual fantasies and personal anecdotes.  Updates on Tom's lung condition and his need for a transplant were interspersed with jokes.  Brian Regan joined the show, and the hosts discussed his recent appearances, blind boxers from a previous show, and Regan's generally pleasant demeanor.  The segment concluded with humorous banter about Regan bringing gifts to the show.

The next segment began with chaotic banter about Brian Regan's ticket arrangements, followed by Regan discussing absurd Pop-Tart instructions.  A caller congratulated the show on its ratings.  Regan discussed the awkwardness of health club orientations.  The hosts then graphically recounted a past incident involving Sandy Cain applying Preparation H to her hemorrhoid on air, including audio clips and reference to a picture of a growth on her body.  Christopher Titus joined in studio, and the conversation turned to Andrew Dice Clay’s visit to Ground Zero, which led to a bizarre, rambling, and increasingly agitated phone call from Dice Clay, claiming police protection and making nonsensical statements. Barry Williams called in, offering Dice Clay a television opportunity.  The segment concluded with the hosts and Titus reacting to Dice Clay's call, speculating on his mental state.

The show concluded with a comedian (possibly concluding a guest appearance) discussing his upcoming shows in various cities, making crude comments about his colleagues (Louis C.K., "Billy," "Robert," "Kelly"), and sharing a humorous anecdote about Metamucil. The show ended with its standard outro, including website information.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's make sure them drums are smacking.  This needs war! 
[00:00:30]  I work hard to take care of every one of my niggas.  Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas.  When I think, meditate and contemplate for my soul.  Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold. 
[00:01:00]  This loyal motherfuckers, I'ma banish you all.  And celebrate all of your absence once I get rid of y'all.  Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart.  Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart.  Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die.  Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye.  So you can witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal.  Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed.  Make you eternally suffer you as one of my men's.  Turn your back on me, I'ma make sure you get it back. 
[00:01:30]  Time's pinched.  Stay true!  Now that's the one thing I religiously pledge.  If you ain't with me, I'ma throw you way over the edge.  This needs war!  If you bad look inside, you can run and you can hide.  If you cross my path, I'll make sure you feel my wrath.  Given you receive, cherries, cherries, breath you breathe.  Strangers on the wall, those who betray are my fault. 
[00:02:00]  As I cherish, I'll be blessed and I greet you with hugs.  You my peoples, when I see you, I embrace you in love.  Yeah, I'll be the one to come and get you out of the hole.  Yeah, you'll be the one to run and leave me out in the cold.  So amazing how many times you part and you steam.  But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream.  The devil is calmer, can't penetrate the steel in my armor.  Time passed by, the pressure got you living with drama.  Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear.  Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, shed in a tear. 
[00:02:30]  Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone.  And have to go to war with fake niggas standing alone.  Until I get with all my loyal niggas going to length.  Don't matter how hard you try, you'll never weaken my strength.  Now I'm with all of my loyal niggas breaking the brand.  And if you diss the code of honor, we take in your head.  This means war!  When I look inside, you can run and you can die.  If you crash my path, I'll make sure you feel my wrath. 
[00:03:00]  Give and you receive, cherish every breath you breathe.  Sisters on the wall, those who betray all must fall.  Nobody helps me.  Ah, ah, ah!  Now we're at you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What you gonna do?  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  What you gonna do?  When you think you can run or you can hop.  When you think you can run or you can hop. 
[00:03:30]  When you think you can run or you can hop.  When you think you can run or you can hop.  Be the best for show love.  Let's cooperate.  This loyalty is something that we won't tolerate.  Deal with these niggas.  Let's put them where they properly go.  On an island far away in a place where nobody knows.  So long fighting this bullshit for so many years.  Watching the danger and niggas double-crossing their pairs.  Yes, I always fight for what is right and put my foot down.  Disrespect my love, I'ma be laying it down. 
[00:04:00]  This means war.  If you're not looking tight, you can run and you can hide.  If you cross my path, I'll make sure you feel my wrath.  Give and you receive, cherish every breath you breathe.  Stitches on the wall.  Those who be prey all must fall.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.

All my dates and info are up on either one of those.  So make sure you check them out and come down to one of my shows.  Later, bitches.  All right.  Do it one more time.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Dave Attell.  We say good morning to Dave Attell on the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys went over to Afghanistan or Iraq? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, I went over with Artie Lang and, you know, Nick DiPaolo, Jim Florentine and Gary Del Vente.  And, yeah, we did a little tour.  USO.  USO tour.  Are you sick of talking about the what happened?  Like you got shot at or something?  Are you sick of talking about that yet?  I don't know who even put the story out.  But we were on a base.  We did a show.  They mortared the base pretty much every day at the same time at night, like 930.  I don't know what that is here.  That would be like a week before we left or something.  It's like incredible.  And, you know, I guess that was like, you know, that happened. 
[00:10:00]  And I didn't hear any explosions.  I didn't see any flashes or anything.  They just, a siren went off and they took us into the bunkers and they said, you know,  we're under attack.  And that was, you know, you got to wait for the all clear and all that kind of thing.  But it definitely was the highlight of the trip, I guess.  Was it at all scary or?  Yeah, I guess it's pretty scary.  I would put it like, you know, above an AIDS test.  But, you know, it's not kind of like, you know, what's going to happen?  Because there's nothing you can really do.  And I'm in the bunker with the Artie Lang. 
[00:10:30]  And, you know, like we're all like looking at each other like, what do we do?  Just sit there.  Yeah.  Hope you don't get hit.  What are you going to do?  You can't run out with a weapon.  You sit there and wait for the real men to take care of you.  Right, right, right.  Well, they just had like an incident over there where it basically was on the wire where the  guys were like overrunning the, you know, forward operating base.  And that's kind of like what I thought when people go, you're under attack.  That's what I thought would be like.  It's a million guys coming at you.  You know, we're in turbans.  Like platoon.  You know, you're, you know, chopping them. 
[00:11:00]  So, but yeah, that was a, I'd say the thing that the scariest thing over there is the heat  and the smell, you know, because they kind of really keep you safe on the USO.  You've done it, Jim, right?  Yeah, well, it was a USO thing.  We were in for about a week.  We were in Iraq.  Yeah.  At a 2003.  I kind of want to go back.  You should.  I told you I wanted to go from Afghanistan to Iraq, but I had to come back for the gong show.  So, you know, show business is important, too.  Well, you know, the bigger name you are, the more of a contributor you'll be eventually.  That's the way I look at it.  Yeah, I could just sit there and, you know, tell them a couple stories, maybe. 
[00:11:30]  Most people are like, I was thinking of going from Aruba to St. Thomas.  Yeah, you know.  It's like, yeah, Iraq and then Afghanistan, some crap hole in Chechnya.  Yeah, Kyrgyzstan.  And this is a true story because I've said it already, but it is definitely true.  A guy in Kyrgyzstan was getting on the plane with a bow and arrow, a real bow and arrow.  And nobody was like, you know, no on the ground, no dogs yelling.  No.  So, basically, I guess that's a good luck charm or something in Kyrgyzstan.  You know, maybe there's some quail hunting to be done on the plane. 
[00:12:00]  That's hysterical.  The thing is, you're on a plane with a bow and arrow.  How long can you hold that back?  You know, a gun you can hold on someone for hours.  Yeah.  That arm's going to start shaking after a few minutes.  You kind of deserve it if you get hit.  Yeah.  You've got to have good bicep muscles.  Yeah, you're really going to hold that back.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  Well, you know, it's really the arrow, not the bow.  Yes, perhaps the arrow part you could stick somebody with.  That arrow.  I missed it.  I had such a good joke, too, man. 
[00:12:30]  I didn't get to it.  Oh, damn.  Dave said I almost went from Afghanistan to Iraq.  I should have fired out.  Good travel agent.  See?  Lamps, that would have gotten.  The USO.  That would have gotten laughs.  Yeah.  The USO is really cool because they always tell you to, like, keep it clean or whatever,  or, like, the guy, the commanders, like, want it clean.  But then when you get there, you're like, you can be as filthy as you want, usually.  And that's kind of the wink and the nod, as I call it.  You know, the don't ask, don't tell.  But it's more like, tell.  You know, give us details. 
[00:13:00]  But why are they telling you to keep it clean to begin with?  I think it's like, there's always, like, one churchy commander.  You know, it's like, hey, fellas, gather around.  Let's play some ping pong.  And, you know, who's up for some chocolate?  Come on in for the big win.  Yeah, that guy.  That guy.  So I think it's like not to upset him and his cronies.  They, you know, want you to, you know, do some, like, puppetry.  Maybe a...  Puppetry.  Man.  Like, what's his name?  Who's the big puppet guy, Jim?  Jeff Dunham?  Yeah, like, he would be the, like, the actor looking for, I think. 
[00:13:30]  Him, you know, like, there's like three acts that they would, like, just love.  Like, nobody would be offended or nobody, you know, him.  Oh, God.  Brian Regan, who's, like, the funniest guy.  He's super clean.  Like, you can bring, like, your eight-year-old child and your 108-year-old grandma to see  him, and everybody's having a good time.  And that's, like, total respect to him, because he's a great comic.  He would be good.  Isn't it like...  Anybody who was in Ice Capades?  It's like seeing bodies blown apart a little more offensive than a tasteless joke.  That's why I asked that question. 
[00:14:00]  That's just hysterical.  That seems ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're looking forward to the gong show, Dave.  Jimmy was a judge, right?  Yes, he was.  Oh, go ahead.  He's on two of the episodes of the one they're airing, though.  I don't know either, because I basically am left out of the whole loop of the thing.  The one I think they reviewed in the post is not the one tonight, but that was one of  our, the ones that's in the post, it was definitely one of our best ones.  And Jim was great.  He was super hilarious.  And also, I'd like to think that constructive criticism. 
[00:14:30]  Do you remember your shows?  Do you remember the acts or anything?  I was on with Ron White and J.B. Smoove, and the acts were, yeah, I do remember the guys  with the ladder.  Which ones did they review in the post?  Did they review...  They didn't review...  No, that's...  Your episode's coming down the pike.  Towards the end, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, we're using you as the money shot, if you will.  We're kind of teasing you like I'm lost.  Teasing you through the season.  You had a good time, right?  Yeah, it was great.  And I'm trying to think of the acts, because there was the one chick who got inside that 
[00:15:00]  giant, like, balloon thing, who I kind of wanted to have sex with.  Yeah, she was hot.  She had, like, little fat, like, Mary Lou Rhetton legs.  She was kind of juicy.  Yeah.  Fire hydrant, that woman.  Some band that was throwing cookies.  It was, like, really bizarre.  Yeah, it's hard to find.  You guys know, because we can never capture, like, what you guys do.  Like, morning radio was my thing of, like, you know, the stuff I've seen over the years  and just, like, the stuff that you guys have done, like, you can never do on TV.  You know that, right?  Well, we learned that, because we did a little pilot for Comedy Central that's never going  to see the light of day. 
[00:15:30]  And a lot of the things we really wanted to do, they're like, oh, you can't do that.  You can't have...  Yeah.  What was the one where the lawyer, because there are female lawyers over there, they didn't want  a girl rolling around in honey?  Yeah.  Why?  Well, we have this bit.  It's called Money Honey.  You get the girl completely naked, but we would clean up for TV a little bit, and you put  honey all over her body, and then she rolls around in money, and...  She gets to keep what sticks to her.  Yeah.  I like that.  Simple.  Silly.  They said, well, if you have a guy do it first, then we might allow it.  Right.  Because they would look at it as if the woman's being victimized. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  It's like, we're just trying to be funny and a little edgy, you know?  Between genius and stupid.  We knew we were in deep trouble when that discussion happened.  We're like, and now we know what you guys go through.  We're like, you know what?  Morning radio, as much as we bitch, we do have a lot more freedom than TV does.  Can you picture an unfunnier thought than a woman who's a lawyer?  Like, who would be a greater buzzkill to a comedy moment?  They said if you have a guy do it...  A female lawyer.  They said if you have a guy do it first, then we'll allow possibly the female to do it. 
[00:16:30]  And I told them, after you have the guy do it, no one's going to be watching the show  anymore, you gotta hit him with the hotness, not the guy doing it.  I just saw a clip of the gong show, some guy with man boobs.  What was he doing?  He was juggling his man boobs or something?  He was what I like to call what the show's about.  You know, like the original gong show was about regular people.  A lot of our acts are like vaudeville, you know, like Vegas, you know, un-cabaret acts  and things like that.  So they're like semi-pros. 
[00:17:00]  This guy was just a regular guy who said, you know, I just wanted to come on and, you  know, and like do it.  And, you know, he didn't win.  I'm not going to say he, you know, he does rap with his man boobs going.  And it was really good.  I think it was, he wouldn't, he, I'm going to say, okay, he got gonged.  And, you know, I don't think he should have gotten gonged because I thought he was a really  cool guy and a real guy.  And the problem with like all these acts that, you know, we, that come to us is like a lot  of them are really professional, you know, so you want to like the raw, real act. 
[00:17:30]  And he was, he was what we're looking for.  So yeah, you want to throw a guy like that in there.  He's got like full C's.  It looks like he was able to make a move to a rap song.  Yeah, he would, he would, uh, he would do that.  And it's like definitely the thing that buys him, you know, a lot of beers, you know,  and I was going to say, but I really mean this as a compliment, but, uh, it was crap  like that, that this guy that I enjoyed the, with the original gong show.  Yeah.  See, just, just, you know, guys from another planet with these weird things they could  do. 
[00:18:00]  You should have, uh, Gene Gene, the dancing machine's legs.  Just have his, his rotting legs up on stage.  Yeah.  Is, uh, Gene Gene representing on the new gong show somehow, some way?  Gene Gene's dead.  Well, we got, I know that, but is there a new Gene Gene or something?  I don't know.  I wanted, uh, I wanted to get a guy from just a bus station, uh, with, uh, type 2 diabetes  and his feet were amputated and tapping in a wheelchair and have him roll around for  music, you know?  Frank Frank, the sitting machine.  Yeah.  You know, just the, uh, eat fruit guy.  But, uh, yeah, we didn't get that. 
[00:18:30]  And the Popsicle Twins was another one that we were looking for, but I think they're like  two, like moms now that live in, uh, you know, like San Bernardino or some Pasadena or  something like that.  They didn't.  That's a, that's actually a good question.  So are you bringing back any of the old acts?  Uh, so far, no.  Uh, the unknown comic, we didn't have him.  Um, I'd like to bring out all the other people who've hosted gong show versions.  Ah, yes.  Are they still alive?  Yeah, they are.  Was it J.P. Morgan?  Uh, yeah, J.P. Morgan was one of the things.  And, um, Jamie Farr was always on there. 
[00:19:00]  He's doing something in Vegas now, so he's not, I don't think we could afford him.  He's in a, uh, like a play.  It looks awful.  They show, like, the, uh, photos of the, a montage of the scenes, and it's all like him  with, and his older wife with whipped cream on his nose, and it just looks revolting.  Jesus, you waited 26 years for this, Jamie.  Is that a, is that a pre-buffet little entertainment to work up an appetite?  Yeah, I have a few labs to work up an appetite.  Because Vegas is 24-7, you know, there's stuff going on all the time.  There's like, there's like Nooner shows there, too, you know?  Like, uh, you ever see, like, when they wheel out the gigantic, like, jackpot machine? 
[00:19:30]  Like, you know, you gotta be by poolside by, you know, 1230, because we're gonna give  away, like, a, you know, a new Chevy something and something.  Oh.  And they wheel a big swap machine out.  Yeah, they wheel them out, and they, yeah.  Yeah, so Vegas is like, uh, you know, there's like a whole day Vegas that nobody knows about.  Oh, no, I've never, I've never seen that.  Yeah, well, you know, because you're having fun at night, that's why.  Yeah.  They call me a night owl day.  Oh.  Jimmy, do you remember who you gonged?  Um, I might have gonged one person.  I didn't gong a lot.  I, I, uh...  He actually had one of the funniest comments on the show, I thought. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  Look at that, Jimmy.  Yeah, he took it a different direction, because there was one act that, uh, I can't say what  act it was, but everybody kind of railed on this act, kind of jumped on it, and you took  his side and, and gave him a, a really nice score, so.  Did I?  Yeah, you did.  Oh, I do kind of vaguely remember that.  You were kind of the, uh, uh, I don't know who it would be, To Kill a Mockingbird, kind  of the, uh...  Well, people tell me, my nickname in high school was Devil's Advocate Jimmy, so I kind of take  up for the little guy, uh, I kind of remember the act, but I don't remember, I remember  the name, I remember what he did. 
[00:20:30]  How did you feel gonging someone?  Did you feel powerful, or?  Nah, I didn't feel like, it was like, I didn't mind doing it, because I thought, I think I  thought he deserved it, but it was like, I didn't want to overdo it either, because  you want to watch people, kind of, it's kind of fun to watch somebody unravel, too.  Like, there was one act that everybody wanted to gong, and I was like, no, I wanted to punish  the audience with the act.  That was good.  That was smart.  So I was like, let them do what they do.  Do you do a little gong dance before you gong?  No.  That was like, that's swimwalk.  Yeah, that's it.  Remember they used to do that in the old days, they would have to really work it around the gong?  My favorite. 
[00:21:00]  That's nuts, by the way.  It was when, like, Rip Taylor would, he would be trying to gong, and Jamie Farr would be  holding him back.  Yeah.  Oh, no, I like this guy.  Oh, don't gong him.  There was some of that.  There was some of that.  That is a little uncomfortable, but yeah, there was some of that.  I should have watched the box set of the original, I would have done something like that.  Yeah, you should have.  See, you should have had some of the elements from the old gong show.  Maybe Jamie Farr should have had someone hold him back when he did After MASH with Harry  Morgan. 
[00:21:30]  And who else did he do with?  It was Harry Morgan, Jamie Farr, and William Christopher.  Father Mulcahy.  Wasn't it also Gary Berghoff?  No, he left it to season eight.  What are you, queer?  I thought he came back for that.  No, he left it to season eight.  I think.  He didn't come back for After MASH?  No, they hated him on this.  I heard Harry Morgan hated him.  None of them liked him.  With that little hand.  Little rotten, gnarled hand.  They always tried to hide with a clipboard.  Yeah.  Why was he hated?  You guys were fans.  Yeah.  We were fans.  Jimmy's obsessed with MASH.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  I'm sorry.  He was a douche, apparently.  What is that, Jimmy?  How is this?  No, that's...  It's not my iPod.  It's not my iPhone.  Is that the queerest ring, or what?  That is a little...  That's you?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  It's like a hospital or something.  Yeah.  Really fast, because it's on the front page, and it's something we were talking about today.  Dave, please jump in.  What is it?  We had a cop here in New York, and he saw some bad things going on, and he shot.  And everyone thought he did the right thing, and then it came out that the cop was drunk.  Not drunk. 
[00:22:30]  He blew up .09, which...  Which technically is drunk if it's .08 is the legal limit.  .08 is the legal limit for driving a car.  Yeah.  For a civilian driving a car.  It's .09 drunk there, Dave.  Not for a cop who's seen too much and tried to clean up the streets as a rookie and now  realizes that it's a never-ending cesspool, something, something, the wire.  Exactly.  Did he hit his target?  Yep.  That's the kind of shooting we need in the Gulf.  The guy, apparently the perp, if you will, had a Tech 9. 
[00:23:00]  Wow.  Old school.  He's running old school weaponry.  Wow.  And fired a few shots off at this officer.  The officer was, he was off duty.  So, he had a couple of drinks.  What are you going to do?  Oh, well, you know, Dirty Harry, wasn't that like three of his movies there?  He's always coming out of a bar or a hot dog stand.  Yeah, Callahan.  It's Irish.  Yeah, there's like a big bank robbery going out right in front of his hot dog stand.  Yeah.  So, the cop, you know, fired back, hit the guy, wounded him, and then he gets put on administrative 
[00:23:30]  leave.  They take his guns away, and they were going to, you know, nail him to the cross.  I believe they listened to our show because we were yelling and screaming yesterday, you  know, leave this guy alone.  Because, here's the deal, if you want off duty cops to be like your second line of defense  to the on duty cops, you can't do things like this to them.  What off duty cop is going to raise a finger to do anything if they have the possibility 
[00:24:00]  of losing the job or going to jail or something like that?  You're going to see something and walk away.  After this, they suggested that these, quote, drunk cops call 911 and not get involved.  Just call 911 and, yeah, as he's shooting at you, as some guy is shooting a Tech 9 at  you.  So, I believe they listened to the show because the update is the guy's back on the job.  Reinstated.  Reinstated.  How many rounds, by the way, did he shoot?  68 rounds fired into the gentleman.  We're getting better. 
[00:24:30]  We're getting better.  For jaywalking.  For jaywalking.  He's back.  Yeah, he's back.  And Commissioner Kelly there praised him.  You like him?  I just like, he looks so much like a cop.  Doesn't he?  He is a movie version of what a cop is supposed to be.  Like he has Batman's number, like that kind of old school Gotham.  Gotham cop.  Yeah.  Did you see the new Batman yet?  No, I didn't.  But I did see someone's girlfriend wearing a cloak on a morning TV show. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Did you see that?  I saw Jill was wearing a little head thing, the Batman.  She was wearing the Batgirl thing?  She was wearing a Batman mask for some reason.  Did she do that when you go out?  Yes.  It's not that I don't want to be sane with you.  Do we know why she was doing that besides obviously promoting the movie?  No, the guys in the prep area, I go, who's that?  And they're like, oh, that's, you know. 
[00:25:30]  Jill Nicolini.  Yeah.  And I'm like, really?  I thought that was like something you make her wear may be very fundamentalist.  No one can see my treasure.  No.  You must stay under wraps or I will cane you.  Yes, you're a very strict Muslim and yet you love pop culture.  Yes, I'm a fan of Batman and Mohammed.  You made it more a hip now.  Right.  That way the ladies don't feel so silly.  I think we're onto something here, how we can take that look and turn it into like, you  know.  Yeah, lemons and make some lemonade. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  Why not?  Take lemons and issue a fatwa.  Boo.  Make some boo.  Yeah, superhero masks.  We were talking about how many movie theaters is Dark Knight's going to, you know, premiere  on or whatever.  It's 25% of all the movie screens in America.  That's what they're doing with this movie.  That's amazing.  That really is amazing.  They've never used this many screens for an opening.  Big.  Big.  What's in the other 75?  WALL-E?  Yeah, no kidding.  WALL-E.  WALL-E. 
[00:26:30]  WALL-E.  What is it called?  Who knows?  WALL-E.  I don't know.  We got to take a break.  David Tells here a couple things we could do.  We're going to talk about The Gong Show a little more, but we could also get into this  story where a woman wants to open a restaurant staffed by...  Nude women.  Well, retards.  What?  That was almost right.  Nude.  No.  Yeah.  Staffed by...  Retards.  We got some audio.  I don't know.  We could go down this path if...  That is great.  All right.  We'll do that next with David Tell, Jim Norton. 
[00:27:00]  Just one restaurant?  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Obie and Anthony.  We got David Tell from The Gong Show in studio.  Make sure you take a peek at that.  Also, what else is going on in the world?  We got Ronnie Wood entering rehab for alcohol.  What?  But I thought his life was going well.  It sounded like he was doing great.  Yeah.  It came out the other day that he married, what, an 18-year-old?  Did he marry her or he's just banging her?  Banging what?  He ran off with his new girlfriend who was like 17, 18. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, was it a girlfriend or did he just run off with her?  Because that's a problem.  That could be a problem.  If you just grab an 18-year-old and run off.  He must be like the, whatever, the interventionist, like, you know, the white rhino.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We found the perfect man, the perfect specimen.  We can break him.  We can break anybody.  And you guys watch Intervention?  I love it.  I laugh my ass off.  Do you watch it backwards?  Yeah. 
[00:28:00]  Sorry, it's an easy one.  I'm coming from the non-show world of easy.  Yeah, I love him.  Yeah, Intervention is just absolutely wonderful.  You ever see the kid who, I think everybody, you feel sorry for everybody, especially the  meth lumberjack and the, you know, the whatever, the heroin kid, you know, homeless.  There was one kid, he was addicted to cough syrup.  Did you see that?  Oh, no.  I didn't see that.  And he was a male prostitute to afford the cough syrup.  I'm not making it up.  Wow.  He would take, like, those little, like, you know.  That's tough.  I think he really needs cough syrup. 
[00:28:30]  Non-growsy.  Yeah.  Right.  My favorite one was the hot, naked girl with the sister.  Yeah.  And basically, I think her father, you know, he owns a lot of property and gave one of the  properties to his whacked-out daughter, who would just like to be naked all the time  and would just destroy the place and throw her own feces, I believe, on the wall.  Yeah.  The sister would come in with, like, a tray of food, like a prison visit and kind of,  like, throw it into the room and run out. 
[00:29:00]  This woman was insane.  And I just sat there and laughed the entire time.  Yeah.  It's supposed to make you feel, like, I guess sad for the person.  Hell, no.  But you just watch and chuckle.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You like to see who shows up at the intervention and it's always, like, you know, the sister,  the mother, the stepdad, other, somebody could be a grandpa.  Yeah, yeah.  A friend of the family, you know.  Yeah.  I should have, like, a celebrity or somebody sitting in there.  And Tom Wopat, you remember him, the original Hazard from Dukes of Hazzard? 
[00:29:30]  It would distract her a little.  She wouldn't be so emotional.  I love when they finally sit the person down and you see the one or two people in the room,  they're, like, with their arms falling like, oh, we're forced to be here.  I could give a crap about this person and her stupid problems.  I love those people.  I've never been a part of an intervention.  As many years I've been sober, I've never.  Really?  Nope.  Never been a part of one.  What does that say about you, though?  I just don't care.  You don't care about anybody.  He's having problems.  Yeah, well, I made a decision.  Put him in the mouth.  Well, what about the, there's a few of them. 
[00:30:00]  The gambling one was really good.  Did you see that, kid?  The most unlikable on all the interventions.  Really?  Yeah, because at the end he still wouldn't apologize.  I think he, like, destroyed his parents' life savings.  Right.  And gambling's even worse because, like, you're so, you know, I know people with gambling problems  and they're, like, so cognizant, whatever, sober, and the whole time they're, you know, jerking  you around, you know, ripping you off, and it's crazy.  Yeah.  No, at least, you know, heroin, you know, there's a little glory in that, you know.  Yeah.  You could die.  Yeah.  You might be shot. 
[00:30:30]  You know, might have to be a prostitute to get it, you know.  Sitting at the, you know, the quickie slots.  There's nothing there.  Well, then we can move on to either the Belmar mayor talking about Guido's or the woman who  wants to open this restaurant.  Where do you want to go, Jimmy?  The woman with the retarded restaurant.  Yeah?  Yeah, of course.  Well, what's the other story first?  Belmar what?  There's a mayor in Belmar down there on the Jersey Shore talking about Guido's and stuff  and chicks from Staten Island.  The guy rules. 
[00:31:00]  He's very, very funny.  I say the...  The torrets?  Please, where every order is wrong, I would love to talk about these.  All right.  Here we go.  Woman wants to open restaurant, staffed by, and I quote, because someone on staff wrote  this, by retards.  How did you phrase it?  It's called, you know what it's called?  It's called dummies.  I get it.  It's almost like Denny's.  I didn't mean it like Denny's.  I just meant dummies and I realized I wasn't saying anything different except dummies. 
[00:31:30]  I'm so irritated right now.  Boo.  What happened to you?  Nothing.  I'm just irritated.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  His...  I'll live.  Let's just play the...  Won't sink.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got a floater.  A South Bend woman wants to open a restaurant, but this one has a flavor unlike any restaurant  you've dined in before.  Drool.  Is that what it's called?  The flavor now?  Yes.  The flavor.  The flavor of spittle.  Yeah.  Can I have some chromosome flavored sorbet, please?  Well, it's God's flavors.  Your flavor can't drive or run for office. 
[00:32:00]  It tastes like chewed fingernails and doo-doo.  Yeah, you're right.  This is a joke bag.  We don't think.  I know.  We're known for going after the easy targets there, aren't we?  But at least we acknowledge it.  We're not going after the gangbangers or anything like that.  Any restaurant you've dined in before, New Center 16's Alana Greenfogle joins us now  in the studio with a taste.  Alana?  Well, this restaurant really will be something worrying.  A South Bend woman wants to open it for her son. 
[00:32:30]  Her son has Down syndrome and can't find a job, a problem many handicapped people have.  Not only will her son get a job at this restaurant, but she plans to hire 30 to 40 people in the  handicapped community.  Wow.  Wow.  Get your hands full there.  Oof.  Planning a time.  Well, I ordered a hamburger, but spaghetti's good now.  I know.  You'll have to order in down, you know. 
[00:33:00]  Can I get some buttons, something shiny, and a hug from a teddy bear?  Oh, you mean a grilled cheese?  Yes.  The menu is written in.  Changed you either five cents or a hundred dollars.  That's potluck, though.  Yeah, you don't know.  You can make out on that deal.  You can make out on that deal.  You can make out on that deal.  You can make out on that deal.  You can make out on that deal.  You can make out on that deal.  You can walk up with a burger.  Yeah.  $50.  $50.  It's like a tsunami.  Like, she's like 30 to 40. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  It's like your son has down.  Sure.  You hook him up with a job.  And then 40 more?  Yeah.  And then a Mongolian horde.  They're going to ride in on each other.  That's a little much.  Maybe start with 10.  At the end of your meal, you're going to have a tough time figuring out which waitress  is yours.  Is that one?  Who didn't masturbate on my coach?  I'd like to know.  I'd like to tip in.  She even has a name, of course.  She's even called Pete Rose's Place. 
[00:34:00]  Wow.  Why a restaurant and not a barbershop?  Let's give them real power.  Let me tell you how sick our audience is.  There are two things they wanted to talk about today.  Only two.  Racism and this.  Look at the phones.  Look at the phones.  There's a little thing by the register.  Take a penny, eat a penny. 
[00:34:30]  Just the idea of the register.  Like, I can just see the hour and a half of standing there.  Oh, my God, right?  You're like, all right.  Oh, well.  Now you owe me $20.  Look, I'm trying to have an open mind, but I really don't want to spend $2,500 for a  hamburger.  Can I help you out?  Can we get someone that knows what the hell is going on here, please?  That's funny.  Man, they're all walking around with the soup bowls on their heads, giving each other  trims.  No, that's for the soup. 
[00:35:00]  For the soup.  You always know the manager is the one with the clean underwear.  Well, let's say hi to Mark in North Carolina.  Mark, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  What's the signature meal of this place?  Frank and beans.  Frank and beans.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How long have you been waiting for a restaurant to open where if they bring you the wrong thing,  you could say, what are you, frigging retarded?  Oh, Christ. 
[00:35:30]  Let's go to Todd in West Virginia.  Yeah, the name of the restaurant is The Olive Burden.  All right.  The Olive Burden.  That sounds biblical there.  The Olive Burden.  Brian in Philly.  Brian.  Take it to these phones fast enough.  Good morning, boys.  Yes.  How are you?  Good.  Just think, this woman is a genius.  She will save a ton of money on a dishwasher.  30 retards and one illegal alien.  Can they run a restaurant?  Yeah, I smell reality show. 
[00:36:00]  What do you think?  You're not from here.  Let's go back to the audio here.  In the handicapped community.  You've got to turn on the oven to four.  Himba Scups, he loves two things.  Put some butter in the pan.  Cooking.  I work at Red Lobster as a cook.  And her son, Skyler.  He's 15 years old.  He has Down syndrome.  I want to just put the two loves together.  He's not even 18?  15.  I know.  In tort years, that's like 35. 
[00:36:30]  Let's go to Vinny and White.  White Hall?  Something like that.  Vinny, what up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I don't know about you, but I would love to see the job interviews.  Just come in and watch Steve interview one of our interns.  I'm sure it's the same procedure.  If you make it within 48 hours of the appointment, you get the job.  Why are you all covered in mud and blood?  I had an interview with a lawnmower. 
[00:37:00]  We've got to give them more credit.  Yeah.  I said this once.  I went into a Burger King once, and I was surprised to see a girl with Down syndrome was at the register.  I walked up, gave my order.  She came back with it quickly, rang me up quickly, and the order was perfectly correct.  And I walked out going, that was the best service I ever got in a fast food restaurant.  And it was from a girl with Down syndrome.  Yeah.  It says a lot for the people working at those places. 
[00:37:30]  Well, let's be honest.  You didn't eat the food after that.  I threw it right away.  I knew it was drooled on.  Did you put your chains in that little thing where you just hand it right to her?  I stuck it up her nose where it was going to end up anyway.  Should I put it in here or just give it right to you?  Phil, a little advice.  If you go to one of these restaurants, don't order the dump lane.  Here's more on it.  You may wonder what this old house has to do with it.  That is like a beginning of a wonderful thing. 
[00:38:00]  Well, here it is.  Kim plans on opening her own restaurant here.  Love to cook.  She'll need to hire the cooks, the servers, the cashiers.  I cook breakfast.  I cook dinner.  I cook dinner.  And they will be handicapped children and adults.  Like your son.  Cook.  Oh, boy.  We cook our dinners.  Food.  Why don't we take a lot of jobs?  Check, please. 
[00:38:30]  Taco dumbbell.  Here's a scene that I hope never happens there.  This guy's choking.  Oh, no.  Can someone do the Heimlich?  No, stop fake swimming in only water you can see.  The Heimlich.  No, not a crazy dance.  We lost him.  Thank you.  We got some sick listeners.  I've never seen the phone spotter.  Look at this strong comeback this radio show made. 
[00:39:00]  Mark Jersey, what's up?  Mark.  Yes, sir.  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, instead of putting those sneeze guards in the salad bar, they could just put the sneeze  guards right on the waiters.  Justin, Long Island.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, as opposed to the special of the day, it's going to be the special worker of the day.  I like that.  Jeff, Jersey. 
[00:39:30]  Morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  There's only going to be one dessert on this menu.  Puddin'.  Puddin'.  Let's go back to the audio.  Pud.  There's not a lot of jobs out there for the handicap, and that's what I want to do.  I want to help them find jobs.  The menu may be familiar.  Biscuits and gravy, French toast, omelets.  But this recipe takes another ingredient.  Love.  Really?  Shut up. 
[00:40:00]  Shut up.  Love.  Love.  Really?  Does that make the food taste better?  That's good.  Or a fine spice rack?  You decide.  Just knowing they're in the back jacking like crazy.  Yeah, there's so much love going on.  There's a special sauce.  Special sauce.  I didn't order special sauce.  Yeah, excuse me.  I ordered mine without the special sauce and boogers.  Pat from Foxborough.  The specials today are Todd, Mike, Brittany, and Carl. 
[00:40:30]  Does she have to pay?  I mean, they're children, too, right?  And, you know, special needs children.  So does she even have to pay them?  Probably $1.29 an hour.  I love the Diet Coke.  Oh, we don't have that.  We only have Drano.  Let's go back to the phones.  John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I'm not thinking putting 30 retards in a place with open flame and sharp knives is a great idea.  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  Newman, Detroit, what's up?  Newman, we love you in Detroit.  Jimmy, I love you.  Hey, you can go to this restaurant for some Downs home cooking.  Downs home cooking.  I heard the phone number is gummy bear, gummy bear, weird noise.  Airball.  Yeah.  Poopy fart.  Let's say hi to our fish.  Let's say hi to Bill in Philly.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on?  Hello, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, how hard is it going to be? 
[00:41:30]  Who's going to go to this place?  How hard is it going to be to park with all the handicapped parking out front?  30 handicapped parking spaces.  Yeah, you've got to park a mile away.  Only two stalls because they need such giant toilets.  Who's going to go?  They're old people.  They've got plenty of time.  Yeah, that's true.  All right.  Let's go.  I ordered my burger three days ago.  Is it coming?  Yeah, just sit there.  Back to the audio.  Ingredients.  Love.  I would do the world for him. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, that's why I would, buddy.  I would do the world for you.  Of course, your own for that ick room that you had.  Whatever happened in there.  Whatever disaster happened is you were shaking and baking him.  Ouch.  It's like when Sutherland kicked the pod when the dog and the homeless guy was sleeping  next to it in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Oh, look at your guy now.  He's like, ah, he's having little black children kiss him. 
[00:42:30]  He's charming.  Lieutenant Andrew Baldwin, MD.  In this restaurant, you're allowed to drink alcohol, but only if you're pregnant.  Do you think they have a tip jar and they ring the bell and then they start boxing?  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom.  Tommy.  Hey there, Tom.  Yeah.  Hey.  You know, instead of the diner being made out of a train car, it's made out of a short bus. 
[00:43:00]  I'm out.  All right.  Back to the audio.  Members of the community have already donated many things to Kim's Project.  Furniture, silverware.  Matches and a ding of gasoline.  Furniture, silverware, containers, racks, heat lamps.  Hockey helmets.  It is kind of better than Last Comic Standing.  I think that guy said it best.  Sharp knives and retards.  Who will win this battle?  I try to watch Last Comic Standing. 
[00:43:30]  No.  Not good?  Is that a good sound or no?  Oof.  Sounds like a bad sound.  The casting.  It's like, well, you just get funny guys.  You have to get the black comic.  You have to get the-  The gay guy?  Did I have a gay guy?  The Asian comic that's going to talk about her, you know, her relatives.  You get the-  The stereotypical Asian voice.  You got the chick comic.  It's like, just get-  Just a bunch of funny guys don't have to-  Why do you have to cast certain roles in these shows? 
[00:44:00]  How about retard comics?  Huh?  They could have a comedy night at this restaurant.  Don't you hate when your pants start swimming?  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They hurt it themselves.  Who has the IQ over 30?  Let me hear you.  Chris in Buffalo, listening on the edge.  The home of Schrader Reagan.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, excuse me, waiter?  There's a waiter in my soup. 
[00:44:30]  She welcomes more support because she says she really could use the help.  She has the idea, but not all the resources.  So we have her contact information on our website, WNDU.com.  All she needs is a restaurant.  So where does the idea stand?  Let's give it a-  I love how the anchor, the woman, she doesn't know what to say.  She's shocked like everybody.  So she goes, it's a worthy idea.  That's the best she could come up with.  Hey, Ana, so where does the idea stand?  Well, let's give it a cooking metaphor.  All the ingredients are out on the counter, and now she's ready to cook. 
[00:45:00]  She has not bought the house yet, but she's planning on doing that very soon.  Dedicated mom.  Yes, she is.  Okay, thanks, Alan.  That's another idea brought to us by pot.  What if I got a house and turned into a restaurant and got all my son's tort friends to work it,  and the house is made out of gingerbread, and you eat it and build it somewhere else again?  I hope it happens, and then you just find out she was completely exploiting the children,  just beating them, locking them in the basement, not giving them money.  Well, what if one of them came up with a new recipe, just like, taste the world by storm? 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  We go to Morristown.  Wolfgang schmuck.  I dropped this red thing and this other thing, and this came out.  Alan Morristown, Al.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Al?  Hey, I'm calling everybody to go to that restaurant, and I told her the top salad.  Yeah, you don't want to order the tossed salad.  Let's go to Mike in Princeton. 
[00:46:00]  Mike.  Hey, guys.  On the dessert menu, they have apple tart, peach tart, and meat tart.  And Jimmy.  Dennis Yonkers.  This is all they want to talk about.  Dennis.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Speaking of secret recipes, meatloaf, corn, and peanuts are the secret ingredient.  These are good.  Yeah.  John.  John in Rochester, the home of Brother Weez.  John, what's up?  Their tip jars consist of bouncy balls and shiny buttons. 
[00:46:30]  And they're totally happy with it.  Let's say hi to JP in Philly.  JP.  Hey, wanted to find out they're going to have a bowl of paint chips next to the register.  Instead of mints or something?  Let's go to Larry in Montana.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, Larry.  Hey, are they going to have delivery?  Maybe they'll roll up on their three-wheel bikes and a helmet and stuff, giving food out? 
[00:47:00]  Delivering food on, like, tricycles or something?  No.  Yeah.  Didn't there be a sign in the bathroom?  Employees mush-wash hands.  Oh.  Of course, Montana.  Of course, Montana would ruin our fun.  They mush-mouth what?  They mush-wash hands.  I bailed out.  They dry them on the back of their underwear.  They do, like, I've seen, you know, come on.  I've all seen some Down Syndrome people.  I used to, they had this thing where they were integrating handicapped children. 
[00:47:30]  Mentally handicapped children into my school back in, like, the third grade.  And it was frightening for us.  They're a little kid, and they're trying to, like, integrate the kids in, thinking it's a good idea.  It was some social program way back when people were silly.  And it was horrifying.  Like, I'm eating lunch, and there was a kid with a pupil that looked like a horse pupil.  You know how they're wide and fuzzy?  And a big, giant head, and he couldn't hold it up.  It kept swinging down, swinging down like that. 
[00:48:00]  And then other kids that had Down Syndrome, and they're constantly, like, shoving their fingers in their nose and down their pants and the back of their pants and everything.  I don't know.  Maybe things have gotten better, but I don't know if, you know, I want to grab my food.  What about the bright side, though?  Your 60 became an A.  I know.  It was grading on a curve.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  I wonder what pictures they'll have on the wall.  I guess Corky.  He's, like, a celebrity. 
[00:48:30]  The cast of Johnny Knoxville in that movie he made, right?  Yeah.  We'll have to sign something.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Chris and PA.  Chris?  Yeah, the cooks are also going to have to wear hair restraints and tongue restraints.  Wheels are starting to fall off here.  Nate, Iowa?  Yeah, I'd like to order a glass of water, head with my supper.  Supper?  With my supper.  With my supper?  All right, we're going to cut our losses.  David Tell, it's been a pleasure.  Hey, this is David Tell.  I'm the new intern on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:49:00]  Can I do this more cop-like?  Hey, this is David Tell.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  They suck.  Opie and Anthony.  Now presenting comedian Greg Giraldo.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  Giraldo was going to be a lawyer.  I fucking forgot to be a lawyer.  Yeah, I went to law school.  I remember reading about hot chicks being only allowed to get paid 500 bucks. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, sure.  Now, when did you realize you didn't want to be a lawyer?  The minute I took the fucking law school test.  You know, 1990.  I graduated in 1990.  I knew right away that this wasn't going to happen, but then I was like locked in.  What was I going to do?  Right.  That's a lot of time to put in.  That was a lot of time.  And then, you know, I ended up quitting.  I quit, and I started doing stand-up, and I was living in this shitty welfare hotel on  32nd Street that my friend was renovating, and I was living there for like eight months.  And then I got a deal to do a sitcom based on me being a lawyer. 
[00:50:00]  So, like, I took that deal money and paid back all this.  It was like this whole full circle bullshit.  You know, like, the only reason to go to law school in the first place is to get the  paper so you can become a lawyer.  You don't learn how to be a lawyer.  And then, you know, I also started handling a lot of murder cases.  I'm losing.  Where did you go to law school?  Harvard.  Do you know who I actually represented?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't just casually say that.  I knew the answer, but I wasn't 100% sure.  Harvard Law School?  You know Harvard Law School?  Yeah, yeah.  Gerald is a smart fuck. 
[00:50:30]  Well, you certainly can't tell now, but at the time...  Harvard Law?  Yeah, it was weird.  You know the only legal case?  I took all that Harvard learning, and you know what I used to do was fucking Jeff Ross,  the comedian, got busted because he was doing some college gig way out in Long  Island, and it was Red Johnny and the round guy and some kid in the audience was waving  this like plastic fake gun around, and I guess it was a very realistic looking fake  gun, so Jeff Ross grabbed it from him.  They started fucking around with the gun, and they ended up getting tackled by security 
[00:51:00]  and taking it in, and you know, it was supposed to be a clear, cut-and-dry menace, whatever.  It was just going to be just going, and I'd never done anything in a courtroom ever, but  I knew a guy who was a DA in Long Island.  I told Jeff, I'll go out with you.  What's the worst that could happen?  We go out there.  They have a picture of the gun, and the thing looks like a gun, so they put it into like  the fucking weapons charge category, and so I'm like...  This is getting a little too heavy.  They called me to the front.  I'm like, I have no idea.  I thought we were just going to say guilty.  They go, well, you can't be guilty, sir.  That's a two-year charge. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, Jesus.  You could have put him in jail, like right there.  Jeff Ross is...  Knowing Jeff like I know now, I would have fucking put him away, for sure.  But at the time...  Wait, because he was waving around now.  Yeah.  He's a gun charge.  Yeah, because on the picture, when they show the...  The person I knew was like a fucking two-year DA, and they were allowed to dismiss these  things.  They're like, just come down.  It'll be no big deal.  You don't even need a lawyer.  But I said, well, I'll take him down.  Just in case.  So we went down there, and then the judge just called us over, and that person was not authorized  to let it go, so it got bumped up to the gun charge division or whatever. 
[00:52:00]  So we had to plead.  I had to plead.  I have no idea what I'm doing here.  Plead.  I have no idea.  Plead retarded.  I had to plead.  I had to plead.  I said, your honor, I was just telling dick jokes on a milk crate last night.  I really not think I ought to be settling this legal issue.  And we had to go back out.  And then Jeff even wanted to plead guilty just to get it over with, because they told him  it probably would be probation.  Oh, that's a great idea.  So we ended up, I think, having to get a real lawyer and come back about a month later.  Well, it wasn't even his fake gun, right? 
[00:52:30]  It wasn't even his fake gun, no.  But for whatever.  Oh, and his co-defendant had a record.  That was the other problem.  Oh, great.  The other kid that he was fucking around with, the kid that had gone to jail for something.  But they know Jeff was a comedian, and they knew the context of what happened.  Yeah, they knew it.  But he ended up not doing any kind of hard time, but they couldn't, for whatever reason,  when you have a gun that looks like a gun, and it's in the file, that, you know, the  kid two years out of law, two months out of law school can't just clear it.  You know, they got to go through some superiors.  Oh, that is amazing.  Yeah, I handle that. 
[00:53:00]  Wow.  And I handled the Vince Champ rape case.  I don't know if you remember.  What is that?  It's some other comic.  Oh, it's just...  What is that about, Jimmy?  Oh, a serial rapist.  Huh?  A serial rapist.  Yeah, it was a comedian.  This guy was a comic, and he was traveling around, and he was like, raping.  You know, you're like, oh, this guy's out there raping all the college kids.  He's like, well, that's what we all do, you know?  And they're like, no, no, I mean physically raping him.  He's actually raping.  He was a comic, and after his show, he was actually a rapist from town to town?  Yeah, he was traveling around from town to town.  He's still in jail. 
[00:53:30]  I think he's got like 25 years.  He's got a long time.  And you guys knew him pretty well?  I never met Vince Champ.  But it was funny.  When it all happened, it kept showing this evening at the improv clip.  Well, them peanuts.  How am I going to stay full with them peanuts?  I want to slow this down a little bit.  So a guy who's making people laugh from town to town after the show is a predator raping women.  He got caught.  Hopefully one of our guys is getting something on Vince Champ.  I mean, I don't know.  A comic's a pretty good cover for a rapist. 
[00:54:00]  You're all over the place.  You travel around, and you have reason to be in the place.  You're probably coming close to raping people anyway.  So I think what he would say is, could you pray for me at the end of it?  He would ask them to pray for him.  This is what I heard.  And it somehow got connected on the internet.  Like, somebody quoted that and said, I think I was raped by this same guy.  Because he asked me to pray for him.  And I don't remember exactly how the description of the car.  But then they connected him through that.  And his college schedules would have killed him.  Because they knew exactly where he was. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, where he was.  And what a coincidence.  When someone's got to call Roger Paul for your...  Some national booker to go through your book.  Wait a minute.  I think we got a rapist.  He did a lot of colleges, though.  I mean, he obviously...  Yeah, well...  That's what bummed me out the most.  And you did his case for real.  No, no, no.  I'm kidding.  That would have been a hell of a...  A hell of a step up.  A serial murderer.  I don't know if you're helping comics here and there.  Who knows?  No, yeah.  Was he black, someone's asking?  Hopefully. 
[00:55:00]  Yes, he was.  He was a black guy?  I believe so, yeah.  I don't know why they're asking, but...  Just a racist.  Yeah, he did.  I mean, he's still in jail.  20, 25 years.  It was like multiple counsel.  Oh, he was a bad boy.  Wow.  He was naughty.  I mean...  He was naughty for sure.  He really was a fresh one.  Facebook was fresh.  He was a ne'er-do-well if ever there was one.  How...  What happened?  I don't know how...  When did that happen, Greg?  That's like eight years ago.  About, yeah.  At least eight years ago.  He'll probably be out soon, I mean.  Ugh.  Nothing on him.  Yeah.  You can't find anything on him?  You sound surprised that he was doing colleges. 
[00:55:30]  How about in...  That's like, why wouldn't you?  You're a serial rapist.  Hey, Mark.  He's going to do the old age homes, you know?  Hey, someone's saying Ronnie knew the rapist.  Oh, sure he did.  Sure he did.  Oh, yeah?  Can we get Ronnie on the phone?  Get Ronnie.  We haven't had him on the air in a while.  Wait.  Could see if he's up yet.  Vince Champ rape.  Vince Champ rape?  Not comic.  Vince Champ in quotes.  I'll slap your face.  Vince Champ in quotes.  And then rape.  Hmm.  All right.  Let's try that out.  Young fucking stupid hawk doesn't know how to Google. 
[00:56:00]  There's nothing on him.  Oh.  You just had it.  I thought.  Oh.  Don't scream at me.  The serious...  Make like you're Googling mayonnaise.  But just put in Vince Champ.  Vince Champ to comic slash serial rapist.  Yeah.  Comic slash serial rapist.  Great bio.  You gotta have a hook.  You gotta have a hook.  Yeah.  Inside the rapist studio.  Wow, that's crazy.  All right.  We're trying to find more info, obviously. 
[00:56:30]  That's a good story.  And he wasn't even like...  It wasn't even just like a sexual predator,  like just a scumbag that would like, you know,  date rape.  I mean, it's bad enough.  He was like hiding the bushes, jump out into...  Just random people kind of...  Hiding on the cars and stuff.  Yeah, there was one case.  I think he went into like a music rehearsal room  and hid behind a piano.  Oh, my God.  That was just the real deal.  And he was a comic on top of that.  But he was hilarious, though.  He was really good. 
[00:57:00]  Let's say hi to Jeff in Illinois.  Jeff.  Hey, Greg Giraldo.  How you doing this morning?  Good.  How you doing?  All right, man.  I just wanted to give you props.  I watched that Comedy Central flavor, flavor roast dinner night.  I'd always heard it on the radio,  but when I saw it,  and I saw the look that Carrot Top was giving you  when you started busting his chops,  it looked like he wanted to come across the stage  and choke the shit out of you.  Yeah, he was shockingly...  He was like shockingly upset. 
[00:57:30]  Did you see all that?  Yeah, yeah.  Tell he was upset.  You know, like, man,  it's bad enough when any normal civilian  gets like blown away at the tone of a roast,  but when a comedian is sitting there like,  you didn't think this shit was going to come up?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, why do you make me feel bad  about doing my own job?  And it is like,  it's like Carrot Top is,  it's your Carrot Top.  Why wouldn't you get goofed on at a room?  Of course.  I even told,  because he's a very nice guy,  I even told him before.  I said, you know,  some of these things are going to get,  I said, I got a lot of stuff on you.  You know,  you're going to hear a lot about yourself,  I'm sure. 
[00:58:00]  How'd you know he objected?  How'd you know he objected?  Because he looked at,  literally,  You could tell on the show.  Because it wasn't for the surgery  that had sealed his tear duct shut.  He would have started crying.  Like,  he literally,  he got very upset.  Well,  let's say hi to John Jersey.  He's saying the same thing.  John,  go ahead.  Dude,  I watched it last night.  I've got it on my iPhone even.  But,  I,  yeah,  when he starts his set,  man,  it was like,  he was all pissed off.  Like you could tell,  he was derailed by it 
[00:58:30]  until he went to his prop trunk.  Yeah.  You know,  the other thing he kept saying,  because he was like,  sort of right next to me,  and at one point,  he's like,  dude,  what are these guys,  you know,  making fun of me?  They're all these fat bald guys.  Why are they making fun of me  for being in shape  and looking good?  I thought,  are you a child?  Oh, wow.  Are you a professional comedian?  Are you a child?  Exactly.  You're right.  You're more muscular  than some of us would.  Yeah,  but he has all sorts  of other things going on.  Doesn't he have like  permanent mascara on  and stuff like that?  he's got all kinds of, 
[00:59:00]  your name is Carrot,  you're fucking calling him.  It's a miracle he got away  as easy as he did,  I thought.  Yeah,  go ahead,  John.  Yeah,  I was going to say,  Greg,  I know you can throw me down,  but you're starting to look  like a fat,  stuttering John Melendez  a little bit on that special.  That's rough.  That does hurt  on a number of levels,  but I agree with you.  Look at that picture  of Carrot Top  that E-Rock just popped up.  I think he finally had it 
[00:59:30]  with people making fun of him.  That guy's ridiculous.  That's what's going on  with this guy.  Look at him,  he's fucking ripped.  Yeah,  he's totally jacked up.  He wasn't like that  when he first started out  in the business, right?  That's also roids and shit.  That's not just normal weight.  That's it.  He's done bad.  It has to be roids.  You can't get like that.  He has that V.  Yeah.  He goes down to the cock.  Yeah,  the old cock muscle.  The Carrot Top,  Dennis from the Bunny Ranch  said Carrot Top goes,  he fucks a lot of broads  in the ranch.  He's a pig, man.  Yeah,  that's what they say.  I love that.  We're going to have him on soon, 
[01:00:00]  I think.  I hope so.  Hopefully he'll talk about that stuff.  The thing is,  when you're Carrot Top  and you're upset,  you storm out of a gig  and you're pissed off  and that's it.  But I saw him the next morning  in the hotel  waiting for his car  and he's all angry.  He's desperate to get out of town  but he's got three fucking  giant steamer trucks  full of his props.  You can't just bolt out.  You're like,  I got to load in and out here.  Here's what you had to say  about Carrot Top.  God,  you are a big,  ghoulish woman.  I'm talking to you, 
[01:00:30]  Carrot Top.  Jesus.  What happened to your face?  You look retarded.  How did you do that?  How did you find a plastic surgeon  who could add a chromosome?  That is really...  That's great.  I think what hurt him...  He wasn't happy.  It wasn't the lines.  It was the immediate laugh  of recognition.  Yeah.  From a thousand people. 
[01:01:00]  Like, you do!  Yup.  Yeah, they always do seem surprised  sometimes at the crowd  because I think  they just lose their minds.  Especially like  because he does Vegas  all the time  so he's in the same venue  night after night  just being a giant star  and the fact that  anyone would turn on him  even a little  he did look like  he was going to cry.  Yeah, yeah.  If that would have bombed  he'd have been all happy.  Right, fine.  Like, yeah, look.  I look great.  He threw it out  and no, I'm bit  because they all think  I look great.  But they're all laughing.  Anybody that starts  lifting weights a lot  like something happens  in your head 
[01:01:30]  where you really forget  that that doesn't necessarily  nobody gives a shit  but it doesn't...  You know, in his mind  it's like  but I'm jacked up!  Like, exactly!  Yeah, he's gone way  past the point of just  nobody gives a shit.  Yeah, I want to be healthy.  Yeah, you don't want to  lose a little double chin.  That's to the point of  yeah, you have some kind  of inner turmoil  that is coming out  in your muscles.  When you're trying  to get a shredded  taint muscle  that's how you push it.  Well, you know what it is  when you start...  Yeah, lifting a little weights  just to kind of feel good 
[01:02:00]  about yourself  is one thing  but you're right.  He's a really cool guy.  When you're working  on that obscure  like side muscle  yeah, then you  there's issues there.  You know what it is  when you make fun of him  you upset the apple cart.  Yes, you don't want  to upset the apple cart.  Easy on the language, Jim.  All right, listen  we got a break.  Greg Giraldo  Gotham Comedy Club  tonight through Sunday.  You sticking around?  If you'll have me  sure, man.  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  All right.  I'll stick around  get coffee  whatever you guys need.  Someone get Greg coffee.  Let me get a dust up. 
[01:02:30]  No, I mean  I'll get it for you  is what I meant.  Oh, no, don't be curious.  Not for you, Jim.  Just for you.  Giraldo, we don't have to tell you  he's really, really funny.  Greg is a really funny.  I love his stand-up.  Hey, we got the great  Ronnie B on the line here.  Hey, Ronnie.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, Ron.  No worries, bud.  Bennington.  What do you say, boys?  Well, we started talking  about Vince Champ  and someone said  you might know this guy.  I know him very well.  I knew him, of course,  years ago.  And it was a very,  very weird story  because he was a guy 
[01:03:00]  that everybody liked.  He was the last guy  anybody thought  would have been involved  in something like this.  Yeah, if you weren't  listening earlier,  Vince, a stand-up comic,  touring a lot of colleges  and after his set  pretty much was a predator  and possibly,  well, I guess he went  to jail for it  so he was caught  raping women.  Yeah.  He did go to jail for it  and here was the thing.  He, if we were making  a movie about Vince,  black girl would be 
[01:03:30]  playing the part  of Vince Champ.  You know what I mean?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Vince was in Covenants?  A black guy who  comfortably moved in  and out of white society.  And believe it,  everybody liked him.  He was everybody's  best friend.  Nobody could say  enough good things  about him.  I would say everyone  liked him there, Ronnie.  Probably a couple of girls  in some of his towns  that he visited.  He was so likable  that even these girls  to this day  can barely bring themselves  to say something bad. 
[01:04:00]  I'm sure his percentage  is way up there  but I would say everybody.  He was one of the  sweetest rapists.  In all honesty,  it's true  because when this happened,  everybody went,  everybody who knew him  immediately said,  this is some kind  of Midwestern,  let's grab the first  black guy we can find.  Nobody knew him  fell for this.  A, he had the nicest  demeanor.  B, he left with a  different white girl  every night.  So he was getting laid. 
[01:04:30]  Like when those people  were saying rape  isn't about sex,  it must be true  because he had sex  all the time.  He always had women.  Hey Ron,  how did he finally  get caught?  I mean,  I read something about  it was,  he had some weird  ritualistic thing  he would say  after each rape  and someone connected  it on the net.  Well,  what happened was this.  And it was actually  like three before  the net got bigger  just right about  the time.  So it was like,  it was like that  era where like 
[01:05:00]  you wouldn't put  together things  as quickly  or couldn't get  information as quickly.  But after he raped  them,  he had them  pray with him.  He was wearing  like a ski mask.  They had to pray.  But the way  that they basically  found him  is so many  of these rapes  were taking place  in these like  little colleges  in, you know,  towns in like  Nebraska  or someplace  out there  where they didn't  have black people.  And the cops  finally got his 
[01:05:30]  calendar.  his fucking  calendar  that he had  was showed  every night  everywhere  that he was  on his tour  That's good evidence.  But Rob,  what made them  suspect him?  Do you know?  They were going,  how could there be  a black guy  in this town?  little, you know,  Midwestern Bible  colleges, you know,  these weren't taking 
[01:06:00]  place at like  the University of  Kansas.  These would be like  little towns  you've never heard  of before.  And they're going,  how could a black  guy be here?  Did he drive in?  And then they  started to put  together, well,  you know,  remember that was  comedy night?  Comedy night we  had that night  and it's fucking  just, I mean,  it was the worst  stupidest thing  that, you know,  crime that you  could have done  when you're the  black guy.  How many women  did he rape?  You know,  I don't remember  the whole thing,  but it literally  was a string. 
[01:06:30]  I mean,  I remember it made  all the news stories  and shit like that.  So it was a big  enough thing  that it got out  there as,  you know,  making the news.  So it was,  you know,  when you get  called serial,  you've been doing  it for a little  while.  Yeah,  true.  But I don't  know,  I guess they  tied it back  to, you know,  he had some  strict upbringing,  blah, blah,  blah, I don't  know.  That whole  pray with me  thing is so  like weird.  You rape a woman 
[01:07:00]  and then pray  with me.  That's some  bullshit.  Like this  happens to  both of us.  Yeah,  yeah.  Instead of  trying to put  this out of  your mind,  now get on  your knees  next to me.  Yeah,  I'll pray  you're not  going to be  going to the  hospital for  a rape kit.  Yeah,  because now  I need  comfort,  not you.  Yeah.  But I  swear to God,  you would  have said  later,  like if you  didn't know  the truth,  you would  have went  on the  fucking  stand for  the guy  and said  this could  never have  happened.  That's  amazing. 
[01:07:30]  Was he a  funny guy?  Nah,  he was fucking  terrible,  but you know,  he was black  and he was nice  to people.  How's everyone  doing?  I know,  I'm the only  black guy.  You know,  he would really  lean on that.  I'm the only  black guy.  So the fucking,  you know,  normal people  would just giggle  and go on  and, you know,  feel like,  oh,  this is relaxing.  You know,  he would do  like self-depreciating  black guy jokes  and you know  how people love  that. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  Later,  he would rape  them.  Now who's  laughing?  Now what's  the fucking  joke?  Terrible.  Fucking  funny.  That's great.  So Ronnie,  you knew him  for a long  time?  Because Ronnie,  I drawled  his own  studio.  Yeah,  I knew him  for a lot  of years.  You know,  never a  problem,  real professional 
[01:08:30]  guy.  Used to help  the other  comics get  into different  clubs around  the country,  everybody.  But nothing  but good  things about  the guy.  You fucking  have no idea  who people are.  How long  did he get?  Yeah.  I know it  was like,  you know,  decades.  I don't know  if they kept  him all that  long.  This had to  be over  about 10  years now.  So he's  probably still  in jail.  Yeah,  he should  be.  I mean,  I can't  imagine  ever  feeling  fucking  safe around  the guy  again. 
[01:09:00]  Because,  like,  how are  you going  to rehabilitate  him when  nobody saw  it happening?  You know,  it's not like  he was running  through town  fucking  frothing at  the mouth.  Right.  Wow.  I wonder if  he's working  on his act.  I know.  That would  be a good  hook.  Nowadays,  that really  would work.  Yeah.  Redeemed  rapist.  20 minutes.  Rapist.  With all the  time he has,  he should come  out as the  greatest comic  ever.  The greatest  comic rapist  in the history.  This was  honestly like,  he was trying  to be like  the black 
[01:09:30]  Brian Regan.  Like,  if you know  how you would  never believe  he did anything  wrong.  Well,  Regan's got  his dark  side.  We all  know that.  You know,  boy,  I'd love to  talk about  some nights  out with  Regan.  Oh,  Regan can  go nuts.  I've seen  him once  have two  Amstel  lights.  Is that  it?  I remember  walking out  of a bar  and it was  daylight out  and we had  just been  drinking all  night long  and he was  hysterical,  but it was  nothing he 
[01:10:00]  would ever  do on stage.  I love  the guy.  Hey,  Ron,  you interviewed  Regan for  Unmasked,  didn't you?  Yeah,  just recently  and here was  the weird  thing,  like,  we invited  the audience  in from  BrianRegan.com  and you know  how,  like,  Brian could  come into  any of your  events and  everybody loves  him and all.  His fans,  his real fans,  you guys would  be shocked  of what they  look like.  It's such  a,  uh,  after church  social thing.  It's the 
[01:10:30]  scariest thing  you've ever  seen.  They're the  whitest,  calmest people  in history.  Really?  Yeah.  It literally  threw me.  How were they  taking the  interview and  stuff?  Were they  getting offended?  They thought  everything was  wonderful.  Thank you so  much.  I'm not even  kidding you,  they brought  their  children.  Oh,  God.  Wow.  How great  would it be  to hear?  They brought  their kids  in a  covered  dish here.  Hold on,  we got 
[01:11:00]  Jay.  It would be  great,  though,  if he's  being interviewed  with Ron  and he's  like,  you know,  the problem  is the  Jew.  The  Jews.  They run  this business,  Ronnie.  Hey,  we got  Jay Moore  on the line,  too.  We got  Ronnie and  now we got  Jay Moore.  What's up,  Jay?  I just  wanted Ron  Bennington to  know that I'm  calling Opie.  Yeah.  I get you guys  back together.  Yeah,  Ron's been trying.  We're like old  girlfriends.  We did a couple  skate the other  night. 
[01:11:30]  Did we ever have  a problem?  I know,  what was there  to patch up?  Every time I  talk to him,  he's like,  you got to talk  to Opie,  Jay.  You have to  mend this fence.  You got to  mend the fence.  That's what  Ronnie does.  I love  Jay.  I love  you.  What comic  are you talking  about?  It's making  me nuts.  Vince Champ?  Yes.  Oh,  what a douchebag  black comic  name that is.  You know  what?  It could only  be worse if  he was Vince  Champ III. 
[01:12:00]  Probably  was.  They are  awful.  Have you  ever noticed  how goofy  white people  are?  They're so  silly.  when you  rape them.  You ever  notice how  a white woman  cries when her  face is being  kicked in?  Oh,  yeah.  They're  hilarious.  The only  white people  that talk  the way  black comics  make white  people sound  is Bryant  Gumbel.  Hi,  everybody.  How are  you?  I'm a 
[01:12:30]  white guy.  Really?  Are you  Greg Gumbel?  Fucking  black guy.  And they  do the  walk.  Yeah,  and if the  white man's  holding you  back,  wouldn't you  give me a  scarier voice  than that?  How does  a white man  hold back  black people  by talking  like this?  Yeah,  we kind  of laugh  at that.  Hi,  honey.  Honey,  I'm  home.  That's  the guy  that's  fucking  keeping you  from getting  the corner  office?  The retarded  guy that  can't walk?  Jesus Christ,  you fucking  ignorant black  asshole.  Make me  sound like a  pirate or 
[01:13:00]  something spooky.  I can't  give you  enough  promotion.  That is  a great  observation.  They do  have the  worst  imitation  of a  white  guy.  We laugh  at that.  We're  completely  accurate on  our  imitations  of black  people.  Oh,  absolutely.  Well,  I never  call up  a plug.  May I  plug  something?  Please.  Jimmy,  where are you  going to be?  I have  no gigs,  but Jay,  we've got  Greg Giraldo  is here  and he's  doing  golf.  Hi, 
[01:13:30]  Greg.  Hey,  Jay,  how you  been?  I'm  very well.  I haven't  seen you  since Tough  Cloud.  Yeah,  I haven't  seen you  since.  Greg needs  to be on  television.  The guys  are good  for the  eyeballs.  He's  easier  in the  eyes.  Oh,  hey.  All that  Vince  Champ  talk's  got me  going  a little  bit  too.  That's  nice.  Greg  Giraldo  is  never  going  to  bother  you.  You're  never  like,  ugh,  this  guy.  It's  always  just  like,  oh,  Greg's  on  good.  Unless  you're  Carrot Top.  Apparently  Carrot Top 
[01:14:00]  doesn't like  Greg.  Yeah,  he needs  to talk  to my  wife.  Carrot Top  is the  Orange  Hulk.  Carrot Top  is Hulk  or his  wife.  Are you  laughing at  Hulk  or his  wife?  Orange  Hulk.  He looks  like the  Hulk  with  Jordis.  Hey,  I have  a webisode  up on  FoxSports.com.  FoxSports.com. 
[01:14:30]  That's  what they  do.  I heard  that they're  hilarious.  Yeah,  they're really  funny.  I will  say this.  They're  pretty damn  funny.  Hey,  how about  OJ getting  arrested with  man boobs?  Well,  he is 60  though.  I don't  give him  60.  He's  like Jim  Brown  too.  He's  not Jim  Brown  the third,  but he's  Jim  Brown  too.  You  don't do  the perp  walk with  fucking  man boobs.  I like  what OJ  said. 
[01:15:00]  What  happened  in Vegas  stays in  Vegas.  Yeah,  I like  you.  You're  going to  be there  for a  long  time,  you  fucking  dope.  Hi,  everybody.  I'm  OJ  Simpson.  How  are you,  fella?  Hey,  Jimmy,  make sure  you put  on  FoxSports.com,  okay?  That's all I  talk about  anyway.  I'd be  happy to.  I heard  your pitch  is very  good.  I love  you.  Are you  doing this  week's  picks?  Hold on,  I just went  in a tunnel.  Say it 
[01:15:30]  again.  Are you  doing this  week's  picks?  Yeah,  it's already  up and  running right  now.  You can  pick it up  right now.  That's  And my  wife and  I  are  playing  whoever  wins  the  pick,  my wife  is going  to bring  her actual  Catholic  school  outfit  out of  storage,  like the  one she  actually wore  in high  school.  If I win,  she has to  wear it,  but it's  not like  from a  costume  shop,  it's like  the actual  one she  wore when  she was  16.  And then  if she  wins,  I have  to wear  it,  but the  joke's  on her  because  y'all  come. 
[01:16:00]  Buckhead.com!  See you  guys later!  Thank you  more,  Jay.  Bye,  Ronnie.  See you,  man.  Ronnie's  still here,  I think.  I thought  that a  long time  ago.  Yeah,  I thought  you did,  Ronnie.  It's hard  to have two  people on  the phone  with Jay  on the  phone.  He was  a bit  focused  today.  We like  when Jay's  focused.  It's very  rare.  I just  walk away  for a while  and let  him scream  stuff.  Very,  very rare.  What can  we expect  on the 
[01:16:30]  Ron and  Fez  show  today?  Well,  Fez  hasn't slept  in two  days.  Oh,  Jesus  Christ.  We'll  see how  the  stents  hold  up.  What  happened?  We'll  see how  his health  is after  not sleeping  for two  days.  Why isn't  he sleeping  now?  Two  days.  I'll  do a  little  contest  to see  if I  could  help  everybody  focus  on the  show.  I  wasn't  happy  with  their  focus  level,  so I  had  him  stay  up  for a  couple  nights.  It's  really  going to  do well  in that 
[01:17:00]  little  fucking  cracker  box  you're  in.  It's  really  just  killing  time  until  the  merger.  That's  what we're  all  doing.  We are  all  just  killing  time  until  this  merger  happens  or  doesn't  happen  or  whatever.  What  happened  the  other  day?  We  lost  power  or  something?  Somebody  cut  through  a  power  line  over  there?  Never  have  any  worries  about it.  I don't  care one  way or  the other  whether  I'm  on  the  air  or  not  on  the  air  doesn't  matter.  Just  go and  do a  show.  Talk  the  same  way  as 
[01:17:30]  I'm  talking  to  you  guys  now.  It  doesn't  matter.  You're  a  consummate  professional.  It's  going to  get  interesting  the next  three  months.  I'm  going to  pay  very  little  attention  to it.  I'm  with you,  man.  You can't  be bothered  anymore  and worry  about this  crap.  I just  call Bob  up and  go,  how much  do  anything  else?  How much  do they  owe me  right  now? 
[01:18:00]  Goddamn.  That's  the way  to look  at it.  Because  if this  merger  goes  through,  Mel  Carmisen's  going to  be the  head  muckety  muck.  Then  you're  going to  have to  deal  with  that.  My  thing  is  to  have  zero  ambition.  That's  exactly  what I  want  my  just  to  not  care  about  any  of  it.  Zero  ambition.  Zero  ambition.  It's  the same  as the  love  from my  kids.  I expect  nothing and  if anything  comes up,  it just  seems really  interesting. 
[01:18:30]  Enjoy it.  All right  there,  Ronnie.  I'll let you  go and  listen to  a run of  Fez after  us.  At noon.  Here on  202.  I check it  out every  day there,  Ron.  I'm glad I  could tell  the story  of old  Vince  Champ,  the  popular  rapist  from the  90s.  evening  at the  improv  set.  If you're  on trial,  the last  thing you  want is  just that  shitty  set  representing 
[01:19:00]  you on  television.  Hi,  everybody.  Hi,  everybody.  Take care,  boys.  Later,  Ronnie.  There's no  way to keep  your street  cred when  fucking  Bud  Friedman and  that stupid  monocle is  infalling you.  Oh,  the monocle.  Yeah.  Your set is  so bad that  even after  being a  serial rapist,  you're still  considered sort  of soft and  unintimidating.  He's an  unthreatening,  soft unthreatening.  He's like Sinbad 
[01:19:30]  with rape.  Hey,  this is Greg  Giraldo.  You can check  out my site,  greggeraldo.com  or at  MySpace  or something  like that.  I'll be  an Anthony.  Hey,  it's Voss,  and you're  listening to the  worst of  Bill Burr.  Billy Burr.  Bill.  What do you  think he likes,  Billy or  Bill?  In LA,  he's probably  Bill.  In New York,  he's Billy,  I think.  You know what  I mean?  Or maybe he's  Bill in LA,  Bill in New 
[01:20:00]  York,  and Billy  when a man  is walking  into his...  God,  do I suck.  I got up  for this.  I'm the  fucking worst.  I came into  New York for  this.  You could have  got anybody  to do this.  Hey,  this is Rich  Voss,  you're listening  to Bill Burr  on the  Opie and  Anthony show.  Why do they  say on the  Opie?  Why do  stations,  everybody say,  hey,  you're watching?  I'm not that  fucking dumb.  I know who I'm  listening to.  I don't get it.  I am convinced  Bill Burr was the  white guy that  laughed a little  too hard at the 
[01:20:30]  Dave Chappelle  bit.  Patrice and I  discussed that as  I was driving  back from Philly,  and Patrice has  got the angle on it.  The guy's nuts.  The guy is nuts.  My sister has the  same look in her  eye, and Dave  needs help.  You think so?  I haven't heard the  clip or anything.  You can't hear a  clip.  You have to watch  him.  Billy, do you  think it was the  white guy that was  laughing at the  clip?  I'm going to  guess Neil  Brennan.  Well, if you  look at the  Time magazine, 
[01:21:00]  this shit's all  documented,  y'all.  If you look at  the Time magazine  thing, Neil's  quote is that  basically they  were corroborating  each other.  So Neil's  quote in that  Time magazine,  the one with  Bill Gates  promoting Xbox  360 in it,  and Neil goes,  and I'm paraphrasing  him, he's like,  Dave said people  are laughing at  me, which he  was talking about  on Oprah, and  Neil says, how  can we laugh at  you?  How can we make  you look like a  fool? 
[01:21:30]  You run the  show.  And Neil was  his head writer  and all that, and  really good friend,  by the way.  No one can make  you look like a  fool.  And Neil, according  to Chappelle, Neil  never called Dave  after he went  AWOL.  How can you not  call?  Listen, if I'm on  your coattails my  entire life, and  my, it fucked  friendship, maybe  we're friends, but  on a business level,  $50 million flew  across the continent.  I'm gonna fucking 
[01:22:00]  try to find my  half a million  dollars or whatever  the fuck I'm  entitled to.  Well, Chappelle  was on Oprah, and  he was doing a  skit.  It was obviously  a hardcore black  skit or whatever,  and some white guy  was laughing a little  too hard, and Dave  was like, oh, now  they're laughing at  me instead of with  me.  And I turned to  Lindsay and went,  Bill Burr.  Oh.  Bill Burr wrecked  the whole thing.  Bill Burr wrecked  the whole thing.  Fucking Bill Burr  is Mrs. Neary's  cow.  Because basically  you were the only,  it was you and  what's his name, 
[01:22:30]  were the only white  guys that were in  skits.  And I'm like, he  had to be on set.  I bet you Bill was  laughing too hard, Dave  said that, motherfucking  honky, and Bill, you  blew up everyone's  spot.  Uh, that's it.  I destroyed the  Chappelle show.  This is neary.  I destroyed the  Chappelle show.  I want to, you know.  This is neary.  And I didn't knock  out mancalf.  I want to, I want to  see if this is the  clip really fast.  We got, we got some  O'Leary.  O'Leary.  Yeah, we got some  Oprah clips.  Chappelle on Oprah.  Listen to this.  I think this is the  clip where Dave explains 
[01:23:00]  why he walked away.  Everybody wants to  know, why'd you walk  away from $50 million?  Well, I wasn't walking  away from the money.  Yeah.  I was walking away  from the circumstances  that they were coming  with the newfound  plateau.  Yeah.  It takes a while  when you punch through  to adjust to the  atmosphere.  It was completely  outside of my frame  of reference.  I've been in show  business since I was  14 and I've heard 
[01:23:30]  the stories of what  happens and I've seen  these kinds of things  play out in front of  me.  Okay.  When you say you  heard the stories,  what do you mean?  What stories?  I mean, you see  before, look,  Mariah Carey made a  $100 million deal and  three months later,  she's all of a sudden  mysteriously crazy.  Armand Lawrence  punches through and  he's waving a gun  on the street screaming,  they're trying to kill  me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We hear those stories.  And it always happens  around the time  it seems as though 
[01:24:00]  they're crossing over  the next plateau.  He never answered  anything.  He was just...  And Oprah goes,  and?  Right, right.  Yeah.  She was getting  frustrated.  I understand his  point, but he's  talking about people  that kind of broke  through to that  next plateau and as  they were riding it  out, caught a lot of  shit, made a lot of  money, but then they're  in the tabloids and  they get ripped apart.  Was it racial  though?  Because he pointed  out two black  people.  He pointed out 
[01:24:30]  Mariah and Martin  Lawrence.  Was he saying  something about when  blacks get to a  certain level or  was he just talking  about celebrity in  general?  I think celebrity in  general.  I don't know.  Mariah Carey is an  awful example because  she was already a  multimillionaire before  she signed that  $100 million deal.  Yeah, it seems like,  all right, Dave, you  made the plateau, but  you were up on the  plateau for like five  minutes and decided  that it was, you know,  a little too much to  deal with.  And then he did  everything he thought  was going to get him  not to be the person  that broke through and 
[01:25:00]  they ripped apart and  labeled as crazy.  And they labeled him as  twice as crazy.  But if Chappelle's a  guy, he is in charge.  If he's doing like a  bit where he's like,  I feel like I'm being  a Sambo or whatever  he felt like, just  don't do that bit.  I mean, you are the  boss.  You could definitely  fucking veto anything  you want to veto.  Dude, he could do 80  Sambo bits where he  shuffles and tap dances  and it wouldn't cancel  out the comedy that he  put on that show that  was fantastic and  cutting edge and what I 
[01:25:30]  think would be empowering  to black people.  It was amazing shit.  I just saw an episode  that I hadn't seen  because Comedy Central  is still cha-chinging  away at that fucking  show.  It was empowering to  black people.  That sounded great.  Well, it absolutely  wasn't.  I never talk like that.  I know.  That's why I was  laughing.  But, you know, he got  away with a lot of  stuff that a lot of  people wouldn't have  gotten away with and it  was funny shit.  That fucking, when they  went back in time and  looked at themselves as  slaves, that is some of  the funniest fucking shit 
[01:26:00]  ever.  And, uh, he walked  away from it.  Wait.  Well, he talks in this  next clip about social  irresponsibility.  And, hey, Opie, you  gotta understand that  listening to clips is  doing this thing an  injustice of really  understanding.  No, Patrice, I'm so  with you.  I went home after we  talked on the phone.  I had it on DVR.  I watched the entire  thing.  There is something in  that guy's eyes that is  just not right.  It's not.  These clips are...  Because he's still a 
[01:26:30]  funny guy no matter  what.  Very funny.  He's a genius.  He is a genius.  But it's, it's, it,  man, that dude, and  if you watch the  fucking show, man,  Oprah's heart, it  starts to go out to  the dude, man.  She starts to realize  what's going on and  she stops trying to  really interview him.  Well, this is the  best, this is the  best clip from the  whole thing.  It's, uh, where he  talks about social  irresponsibility with the  bits he was coming up  with.  And he also mentions,  uh, Bill Burr laughing 
[01:27:00]  too much and blowing  up everyone's spot.  It's you, Bill, isn't it?  It was you, Bill.  And I called in, man,  and I cursed, and he  dumped out.  Yeah, now I'm going to  call Oprah, me and  Dave are going to  argue over the phone.  Wasn't it, Bill?  There's a thing.  It was in your tone, Dave.  It's Bill Burr that he  talks about here.  I'm convinced of it.  Listen to this clip.  Like, there's this one  sketch we did that was  about, uh, this pixie that  would appear whenever  racist things happen.  Whenever someone make you  feel like they calling you 
[01:27:30]  that N-word.  Uh-huh.  But don't say it.  And it was, it was  funny.  And the premise of the  sketch was that every race  had this, like, pixie,  it's, like, racial complex.  And, uh, but the, but  the pixie was in blackface.  Now, blackface is a very  difficult image.  But the reason I had  chosen blackface at the  time was because this was  going to be the visual  personification of the N-word.  Right.  It was a, it was a good 
[01:28:00]  spirit or intention behind  it.  But, what I didn't  consider is how many  people watched the show  and how the way people  use television is  subjective.  So then when I'm on the  set and we're finally  taping the sketch,  somebody on the set  that was white laughed  in such a way, I know  the difference of people  laughing with me and  people laughing at me.  And it was the first  time I'd ever gotten a  laugh that I was 
[01:28:30]  uncomfortable with.  Hmm.  Not just uncomfortable,  but, like, should I  fire this person?  Bill, comment?  What about that?  I mean, I don't know.  I thought that that was  fucking interesting.  Bill, comment?  I am convinced it's  Bill Burr blew up this  whole fucking Chappelle  thing.  We got him on the  phone.  Were you on set?  Hold on, Bill.  Were you on set for  that bit?  If you look at my reel  from the Chappelle  show, I had nothing to 
[01:29:00]  do with that sketch.  Were you on set for  that bit?  I need to refer them  to my lawyer.  I'm not answering any  of them.  Not only were you on  set, but while he was  doing that, you were  laughing and stomping and  pointing and yelling,  three-fifths of a vote.  Three-fifths of a vote.  Bill, we've spent a lot  of time with you on this  radio show.  All I want to know,  were you on set?  Listen, I'm going to  tell you something right  now.  Call Oprah!  It was Bill Burr!  None of the shit I've  done on your show is  admissible as evidence. 
[01:29:30]  You can't bring up  other crimes that I've  done to convict me of  that crime.  I do know that shit.  I was watching that  going, holy shit,  Bill Burr blew up  everyone's spot.  Bill is one of the  least racist people  I've ever seen.  That isn't true.  You're just a fucking  white guy with an arsenal.  You set the bar so  fucking high.  Maybe that's it.  I'm just looking at,  like, yeah, I could  look at Klan members  and go, he's a  reasonable man.  Well, Bill's a good  guy.  He didn't laugh at  Mississippi Burning.  And you know what?  Chappelle is a little  nuts because one guy  over laughing during one 
[01:30:00]  sketch, the whole key is  like the whole time Dave  goes, well, I did this  and I did that.  All right, man, so it was  a misfire.  Redo the bit or talk to  the guy and ask him what  the problem is.  But see, Naughty, that's  why you, like, like,  analyzing this thing,  like, on, like, a certain  level is not the right  place to go because you  can rationalize out of  each of those things.  It's like if Opie goes,  hey, man, this  motherfucker was laughing  at me.  Well, you know what?  How about this?  Get the fuck out the  studio, boss.  That's the boss talking. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Get out of my face.  Stop laughing.  You know what?  You're distracting me  with your at me laugh.  Now get out of here,  fuck face.  That's what is so easy  to just say that.  That's what I'm saying.  Each thing, like, and  Oprah wouldn't, she  wouldn't go there because  at some point she knew  what was going on, man.  At some point she knew  what was going on.  Either he's crazy or has  just the greatest ethics  that I've ever seen 
[01:31:00]  because if I was being  offered $50 million,  I would stand up on this  console naked and have  people laugh at my penis  and wouldn't care.  I wouldn't fucking care.  Well, now he's saying  he would come back,  but that $50 million he  wants to give to causes.  I always honestly felt  that Dave didn't want,  Dave likes to be on the  outside looking in,  and he got sucked into  the whole, you know,  you can't go anywhere 
[01:31:30]  kind of famous.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  They were doing this  little sketch show  on Comedy Central.  I mean, I guess South Park  kind of blew up,  but I mean, you know,  for it to take off the way  the fucking thing did,  I don't think,  and then he's going out  doing his shows  and everybody's yelling  out shit.  I mean, I always looked  at it like,  until you're in that guy's  position with all that  kind of pressure on him,  I mean, I can't really  sit there and be,  oh, you know what I  would have done if,  if I would have done  it this way, 
[01:32:00]  I would have done it  that way, I mean,  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, he thought the  bits were socially,  social irresponsibility  on his part.  Which is such a pain  that black people  have to go through  that you motherfuckers  don't,  is that y'all can do  any goofy shit  you want  and not think about  how it makes  the white people look.  Don't fucking think  so hard.  He shouldn't think of it.  Holy shit,  that was genius stuff.  It was hysterically funny.  It was,  it was,  it was,  it was great shit,  but,  and some of those  to be as funny  as you want to be, 
[01:32:30]  you got to be uninhibited  and sometimes  you're going to have  people go,  oh,  that was,  you know,  I didn't like  that whole thing  where he,  where he put on  the black face  and tapped,  you know.  Was that happening?  A lot of black guys  probably coming up to him  and going,  hey Dave,  I like your show.  Someone got to him.  But you know,  what the fuck, man?  You're making us  look like,  uh,  Sambo's.  We gotta represent,  we gotta represent  all the black people.  That's a,  that's a pressure,  you know what I'm saying?  That's a fucking pressure.  See,  no,  you guys gotta get past  the fucking representing 
[01:33:00]  for each other  and just do what's,  look,  I agree with you,  man.  Jesus.  I fucking absolutely  agree with you  because,  and I only agree with you  because I'm absolving black people,  I'm saying get over it  because white people can do it.  White people can just run around  and do anything they want.  Jim Carrey can dress  as a green hunk of shit,  he can dress as a fuck,  he can play a pixie,  whatever he wants to do,  no white people sit around  and go,  ah,  Jim Carrey's making us  look like buffoons.  Right. 
[01:33:30]  Well,  Chappelle brought up  a great point on Oprah  saying,  what's going on  with the black man  when he gets any kind  of success?  Hollywood wants to throw  the black man in a dress.  And then he has an example,  he's on a set,  he's doing a movie  and it wasn't even  a scene that was written  and all of a sudden  there's a dress in his trailer  and the director  or somebody comes in and goes,  yeah,  you're gonna break out  of prison with,  I think it was  Martin Lawrence  and you're gonna break  out of prison  as a prostitute,  a black prostitute.  Isn't that,  that's chapter eight  of the racist handbook? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah,  and Dave Chappelle's like,  I ain't fucking  wearing the dress,  don't feel comfortable  and they were so bummed out  and they're trying  to talk him into  wearing the dress.  He made a pretty good point,  you know?  Yeah.  He goes,  I don't need to wear  a dress to be funny.  If those guys need  to wear a dress to be funny,  then so be it,  but I'm not doing that.  What?  And then they also go,  but so-and-so wore it,  so-and-so wore it,  so-and-so,  and he goes,  well,  doesn't that make it  kind of hack at this point?  Yeah,  oh,  that's right,  that show was so good,  man.  Right.  They really,  if anybody-  He trashed Milton Berle,  though,  with the dress thing.  I'm like,  come on.  All right,  Miltie wore the dress, 
[01:34:30]  but he was funny  for other things as well.  He wasn't a hack.  And it was in the 50s  and he didn't have  the freedom Comedy Central  gave Dave.  Milton Berle wore a dress.  What was that,  1954?  Yeah,  we gotta stick up  for Whitey,  man.  Absolutely.  You look good in the dress.  Milton is big cock.  That's right.  Big homo Milton Berle.  All right.  Bill,  this is your last chance  before people are convinced  that you blew up  Dave Chappelle's whole thing.  Listen,  I told you right now,  I got a lawyer  and I'm not allowed  to talk about this stuff  at this point. 
[01:35:00]  I couldn't even-  I'm just saying in the end  the truth's gonna come out.  I couldn't even come up  with a second name.  I couldn't-  Yeah, right?  Who else?  And I knew some of the players  in that show  just, you know,  being around a while  and like,  Bill Burr.  Jackass.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck.  All right,  take it easy.  Bye, sweetie.  Bye, Jimmy.  See you, buddy.  Yo, this is Don Ed Rollins  and you listen to  the absolutely worst  the shit sucks  of Opie and Anthony.  Your career's over, bitch.  Hey, Bill was bringing up  a good point in the office  before the show.  We wrote it down too.  Speed 2. 
[01:35:30]  Now, I thought Speed 2  was a good movie.  Ugh.  Never saw it,  but I thought it did well.  I thought the reviewers  liked it.  No, no, no.  It was believable.  It was just a-  It was a bomb.  It was a bomb?  From the get-go?  Yeah, I was on the tour bus  on the monster comedy event there.  I'm really whoring myself out today.  You certainly are.  I really am.  You know, I don't give a shit.  You're wearing your cape,  my friend.  I just saw the end of that movie.  Like, literally,  the boat was heading  towards the island. 
[01:36:00]  What was the premise?  The whole premise  is just like the first one.  Except it's a boat  instead of a bus.  You know, you had to keep  the bus going  like over 60 miles an hour.  I guess you had to keep  the boat going  at such and such knots.  Knots.  But why wouldn't they  just jump in the water?  Knots.  I'm sure they figured that out.  You can handle it.  Middle of the ocean,  hypothermia.  Oh, yeah, what?  Why wouldn't they  just jump in the water?  You can't jump off a bus,  but you can jump off a boat.  Was it the passenger boat?  Well, it's like  one of those big cruise ships.  A cruise ship?  You can't get everybody  jumping off a cruise ship. 
[01:36:30]  Why not?  And then what about  they start lowering  the lifeboats  and they probably blow it up  like they said.  If anybody tries  to get off of the bus,  they were going to blow it up  even if it's doing, you know.  Plus, that's like  jumping off a brownstone.  I mean, those things  are way up there.  Oh, they're huge.  Hitting the water  like some cement.  Can't do that.  Well, Communicate came in.  What is that?  Location check from Elon?  Let's see if it's  a location check.  No.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Oh, buy, buy, sell, sell. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  Anyway, speed two.  Yeah, so you saw  the end of the movie.  Yeah, it's like  the very end of the movie.  So, you know,  they're literally  heading towards the island.  So I figured  this must be  the last six minutes  before somehow  Sandra saves the day.  It was 45 minutes  of the most horrific  just filmmaking  ever fucking made.  First of all,  they come flying in  and they're going  right at like  an oil tanker.  And somehow,  uh, uh, uh,  who's the lead in that?  Oh, uh, 
[01:37:30]  Sandra Bullock?  No, no.  No, the...  O'Donnell?  Chris O'Donnell,  is it?  No, uh,  no!  No!  William Dafoe.  The guy from Sleepers.  Now this whole fucking  thing is unraveling.  God damn it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait.  No, no.  I don't know who they are.  Wait, here comes  Jason Patrick.  Jason Patrick.  Oh, that guy.  I was distracted  because I went to  Rotten Tomatoes.  Go back again.  Just to regroup here.  It got a 4% rating.  96% of the reviewers  across America 
[01:38:00]  hated Speed 2.  And one of the reviewers  says,  if Speed 2 and,  let's say,  Kissed,  a dark comedy  about a woman necrophile  were the very last  two movies at the  video store,  I would pick Kissed.  Ooh.  It got horrendous reviews.  But anyway,  so it's Jason Patrick.  So you figure it's  like the end of the movie,  like you can see the island.  Turns out they're  heading right to  towards an oil tanker.  And,  I don't know,  they go underneath  and somehow they turn  the things that steer  the rudders.  The rudders, yeah.  And they basically  side swipe 
[01:38:30]  the oil tanker  like it's a fucking  parked car  sticking all these  holes in the side of it.  So now you're thinking,  okay,  everyone has this big,  hey, we made it,  the big hug.  And then one extra,  worst extras ever,  like, you know,  looking off into the horizon  just goes,  oh, shit.  Then they cut to  somebody else.  Wait, that wasn't  the end of the movie?  No, it's not.  It keeps going.  The oh, shit take.  Yes.  But that would have been  a great end of the movie.  No.  The oh, shit take.  This is speed too, man.  You gotta make it bigger.  Right. 
[01:39:00]  But that looked pretty intense  and they just got out of danger.  The oil rig obviously  could explode it.  Dude, remember speed?  When they stopped the bus  and everyone was fine,  it wasn't the end of the movie.  That's true.  Jason keeps getting up.  It's the same shit.  Now they're heading  towards the fucking island.  And we know that  because the extra is  with the oh, shit.  The oh, shit take.  Oh, shit.  And they're blowing the horn.  That is worse than  the buddy movie  Through the Windshield  Whoa take.  Yes.  Where they're both  heading towards something  where they jump over something.  Yeah.  And you hug each other.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Whoa.  Horrendous.  Then they start going towards  I mean, dude,  and then the side swiping  of the oil tanker  was at least fucking 10 minutes  to finally get up to there.  So I'm thinking  it was such a build up.  You thought it was  the end of the movie.  Now they're heading  towards the fucking island.  Still going 15 minutes.  People clutching on.  Water's filling up  because they side swiped  an oil tanker.  Ah.  Plows into the beach.  Doesn't stop.  Keeps going.  So the boat now  is going through  an island.  It's slicing an island in half.  It's going up a street  and the extras, 
[01:40:00]  you know,  the stuntmen are doing the  you know,  get out of the way,  get in the way,  get out of the way,  fucking jump out of the way.  There's like 50  of those fucking shots.  People drinking like  espressos and  ooh,  it's a boat  jumping out of the way  of their tables.  I love how it's the big  burly guys all the time  because they got to use  the stuntmen  whenever they're doing  this thing.  Like my favorite  has always been  the car  busting through the gate  take.  And there's just some guy  hanging out in front  of the gate  for some reason  and at the last minute  he jumps out of the way 
[01:40:30]  and it's always this big  burly stuntman  looking guy  and you bring up  a great point.  They always look  like they're ready  to get out of the way.  Like they never look  completely relaxed  whether they're sitting  down at a table  drinking tea.  Yeah,  whenever they're sitting  at a table  they're leaned  on their forearm  ready to jump up  because they know  the fucking car's coming.  They're leaning.  Their legs are like  they're at the starting  line of a race.  They're all set up  like ready to go.  They're sweating.  It's like the third take  they got nicked  by the bumper  on the last one. 
[01:41:00]  But they're still  drinking their cappuccino.  Right, right.  Just drinking  and then whoa,  out of the way.  It just keeps plowing  through this fucking island.  I want to go with this now.  I'm trying to make this  quicker than the end  of the movie  because it's horrendous.  You've got to think  the island is going  to slow the boat down  and now it's got  to blow up.  No, it took at least  like 20 blocks.  No, it doesn't blow up.  It doesn't even tip over.  No, it stays there.  It stays totally upright,  goes right up the street,  plows through some houses.  But how is it keeping  the speed going  if it's cutting 
[01:41:30]  through an island?  It's a magic of Hollywood,  Opie.  All right.  It just keeps going.  All right.  It finally comes  to a stop.  You're thinking  this is the fucking end.  You've got to finally  roll the credits.  You know what I forgot?  Sandra Bullock  is on dual-connected  jet skis  with Willem Dafoe  who plays the bad guy.  Now Jason Patrick  has to go rescue  this bitch.  Of course.  Jumps off down a house  as everyone's looking like,  what the fuck, you know?  He somehow commandeers  a speedboat  from the black dude  from that stripper movie  that bombed.  Oh, right, right. 
[01:42:00]  Showgirls.  Showgirls.  The guy with the dreadlocks,  right?  I think he gets stabbed  in Oz or something, right?  So he jumps on that thing.  Willem Dafoe is now  in a fucking plane.  This is like 35 minutes  into the end of the movie.  He's now in a plane  with Sandra Bull  going to take off.  So he's got to be going  at least 80 miles an hour.  Yeah.  They're cruising in a boat.  Jason Patrick,  whatever the fuck his name is,  takes like a harpoon,  shoots the plane.  Where did he get  the harpoon from?  I don't know.  He just happened  to have it on the jet ski.  He shoots the plane, right?  It goes into the side of it.  He holds on, 
[01:42:30]  then hits a button  for some sort of  automatic reel-in mechanism.  What is this used for  aside from rescuing people  from a plane,  from a jet ski?  I have no idea.  So now,  he just holds onto the gun  and he's now in the water  skimming across the water,  dragging behind a fucking plane  that's taking off.  He's not losing his grip.  He's definitely squinting  his eyes a little.  And he comes up.  He finally gets up  onto the plane, right?  Yeah.  Stands on the side of it,  says,  hey, what's up, sweetie?  To Sandra.  And then does the hacky  punch to Willem Dafoe. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Grabs her.  They jump off.  Part of the plane,  like, you know,  the plane floats on.  The pontoons.  Yeah.  It breaks off.  They have them straddled.  His nuts are fully exposed.  He drops like 90 feet  right into the water.  Totally fine.  They're fine.  And they just go along  like a little friendly torpedo.  Now Willem Dafoe's like,  fuck, he lost the money,  he lost the girl,  he looks up,  it's the fucking oil tanker again.  Ah, remember from hitting it.  How long ago was that in the movie?  At least 45 minutes. 
[01:43:30]  Now, at this point,  you're like,  please hit the fucking oil tanker  and end it.  No.  He pulls back on the stick.  Is he gonna hit it?  No.  Uh-oh.  He just goes straight up,  straight up,  and then he's smiling.  Oh, good.  Made it.  I made it.  I made it.  Turns around,  there's like some sort of weather vane  or some shit on the boat.  He just fucking comes to a dead stop,  like impales the plane  on this thing  and passes out.  Now they got to the fucking,  the chick and the dude,  they're hugging,  you think it's over,  Willem Dafoe wakes up,  it's still not over.  It's still going.  Looks down,  there's gas dripping, 
[01:44:00]  finally his fucking,  mercilessly,  his fucking,  his plane blows up  and then sets off  a bunch of explosions  on the oil tanker.  It's at least,  I swear to God,  it has to be at least 40 minutes.  You know,  I've never seen the end of that movie.  I've seen the boat  hit the island  and then I changed the channel  because I could swear  that was the end of the movie.  It's,  and you watch the whole thing  in dead silence.  It's like,  it's,  I was going on next  and they're like,  you're on next,  I'm like,  I have to see the end of this.  These action movies at times  are so exhausting 
[01:44:30]  because it's one stunt  after another  after another  after another  and you're like,  when,  yeah,  exactly,  when does this end?  So I could go home.  Well, fortunately with Speed 2,  the character development  was so tremendous  that I cared about  everybody in it.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  Joe?  Bill Burr.  Yes?  I want to call you  an a-hole right now  for ruining Speed 2 for me.  I'm going to watch that tonight.  You ruined the ending.  You ruined it.  I thought he was going to give me shit  for how long it took  to tell the end  of that fucking story.  Let's go to Tyler.  He's saying we're forgetting something.  Tyler? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah,  hey,  what's going on guys?  Hey.  You forgot the final ending.  What's that?  They're on the pontoon  and they're cruising  towards the oil tanker  and the thing starts to explode  so Sandra rolls off  and starts to drown  because she's all bound up.  It's still not over?  Oh,  I forgot that.  Oh my God,  it's not over.  It didn't end with the oil tanker exploding?  That's,  he's right.  Sandra starts to drown  and Jason Patrick has to dive in  and do the buddy breathe thing  because she's bound with chains.  Oh,  so he's like kissing her? 
[01:45:30]  Yes.  And breathing into her mouth  and how did he get the chains off of her?  He just slammed her to the top,  I guess,  and the black dude in the boat  picked her up.  Ah.  Holy crap.  And then it was over?  Yeah,  I think so.  Oh,  but they had the jewels  so everything was okay.  Uh-huh.  Oh,  so bad.  And then he asked her to marry her.  Is that awful?  All right.  Oh,  and then when they were chasing the plane,  the black dude and his girlfriend  just had like the worst,  hackiest lines. 
[01:46:00]  Like he was all scared  and she was laughing  like this was all fun.  Really?  Chasing this terrorist  with this woman held hostage.  Yeah,  nothing beats the  throw in the funny line  when you would absolutely  be petrified for your life.  That whole thing.  That was a big 80s thing too.  All right.  We're going to step aside  and take a little break.  Hello,  everyone.  This is Danny in for Bill Burr.  Bill would love to deliver  this message to you,  but he's out in L.A.  being a gigantic superstar.  So,  for Bill's upcoming show dates,  podcasts, 
[01:46:30]  and CDs,  go to billburr.com  or check him out on MySpace  at MySpace.com  slash Bill Burr.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey,  it's Louis C.K.  and this is the worst  of Robert Kelly  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Robert Kelly,  fat,  just like everybody else  on this show.  If you were in the room  when Robert Kelly  was being born,  you'd see a cunt  coming out of some  cunt's cunt.  Mark from Virginia,  what's up?  Hey,  man,  I got to defend  little Jimmy.  What's that, 
[01:47:00]  fella?  I got to defend  little Jimmy,  man.  You're the man.  Without you,  man,  it wouldn't be a great show.  Oh,  and hey,  you got a great show,  man,  but you got to keep  little Jimmy in there.  Thank you.  We're keeping little Jimmy.  Well,  Jimmy's not going anywhere.  I don't want to get fired.  We just want him  to fart less,  that's all.  Hey,  man,  he's got to relieve  some pressure from somehow.  He can't just whip out  his mule  and do it right there  in the show.  Thank you,  sir.  That's exactly what,  and I get very excited  sometimes.  It just sneaks out.  I don't mean to ruin the show.  There you go,  man.  He pops. 
[01:47:30]  You're my idol,  little Jimmy.  Thank you,  buddy.  He pops boners all the time.  So what?  It's all he owes  are good things.  Dude,  but you have to show everyone.  He gets our attention  and he grabs onto it.  We're trying to enjoy  the freaking 20-year-old  stripper from L.A.,  and all of a sudden,  we're all like,  what?  What has he got?  And then we're looking  at your hog again.  You don't have to look.  Well,  when you're jumping up and down  like you might have something.  I don't jump.  I just kind of point,  and you guys choose to look.  I don't jump.  He definitely tries  to get your attention.  He lifts it over the edge  of the console. 
[01:48:00]  And rests it.  He grabs,  pulls it sideways,  and shakes it a little.  Yeah.  I want a little extension  built around his area.  A mule hider?  Yes.  It's like a sneeze guard.  Exactly.  A mule guard?  A mule guard.  It's a perfect height  where he can just plop it  on the table.  It does.  He lays it on there.  I do rub it against this thing.  It's perfect.  I'll have some of the  Norton wiener.  You can't out gay Norton,  though.  No, it's not a gay thing  when I do that.  I'm usually turned out  by a woman.  It's not like I'm just...  You can't. 
[01:48:30]  He'll try to hug me  or something.  I understand what  Bob Kelly's saying,  though.  You know, out gay.  I mean, you like to try  to get that reaction  by doing something  that would be perceived  as gay.  No, I don't.  One time, I actually...  You know, he does gay things  once in a while  and it freaks you out.  And one time, I was like,  you know what?  I'm going to out gay him.  And I actually...  You can't out gay him.  I stuck my finger  right near his butt  and he actually stopped  and backed up  and my finger went  in his asshole  and I just...  How many knuckles  did he get in there?  It was one and a half.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  It was like a little shrimp.  I could actually  bend my finger.  That did not happen.  He just stopped  and then he went like this.  Ooh.  He tried to put his finger  by my ass  and it's like,  look, you're going to learn  a lesson the hard way.  Why is your pants down  at this point?  No, no, no.  My pants were on.  Easy, easy, Opie.  Why did you get  figured that out?  We were walking  in the hallway  in the apartment.  I asked how many knuckles  you took.  You took a knuckle  and a half  through the jeans?  I would actually  take something real,  enhance it,  exaggerate it,  therein lies the ha-ha.  Yeah, he didn't mean  to put it in my ass.  I didn't mean  I stuck my finger  in his ass.  That would be gay,  wouldn't it?  He put it against my ass  and I just backed up 
[01:49:30]  against it to teach him  who was boss.  He learned a lesson.  Well, you should have told me  it was exaggerated humor.  We don't know.  I thought that's  what humor was.  Not all the time.  Really?  What's the other type of humor?  We've all seen him naked  so it was quite possible  that that actually happened.  Don't look at me  like I'm an alien.  That's an exaggeration too.  I've never seen Jimmy naked.  There you go.  Alright, show him your hug.  I don't want to.  No, I won't show him my hug.  I don't want to see Jimmy naked.  I love the face he gets  when he gets,  I was actually with him  one time  and he gets this face,  his eyes just open wide  and his head turns down 
[01:50:00]  and his upper lip  goes underneath his back tooth  and he just looks  like a little troll  and he just doesn't blink  like Christopher Walken  in a scene  and he just stares  at the girl like,  yeah.  Yeah, it is nasty.  Oh, he does.  It's just evil.  He is his little body.  Alright, you know,  no one's really  screening the calls today.  The behind the scenes  people are very, very slow.  Everyone's tired today.  We're all tired.  Hello, who's this?  Oh, that was good. 
[01:50:30]  A hang-up.  I was on that line.  I'm going to do it myself.  Hello, who's this?  Hello?  Hey, uh, oh, it's, oh.  What?  Hey, Opie?  Yeah.  Oh, what's going on?  Hi, fella.  I was going to set up  for, uh, what did I learn,  but, uh, it's a little too early.  Yeah.  I was going to hold on,  hold for a while,  but, uh, it's cool.  You were going to hope  to hold for about 45 minutes?  I guess, uh,  I'll do one a little early.  For some reason,  Jimmy Norton plays, uh,  Monster Rain just fine,  but today, 
[01:51:00]  today, a little sticky  banana juice  got his nerves up  for some reason.  Yeah, that's true.  It is, alright,  inconsistent,  but it freaked me.  I didn't know what it was.  It was probably sitting  in the deli or something,  and God knows what  those savages spill  on their fruit.  By the way,  we did get a brand new  Monster Rain song.  How many is that?  This is at least, uh,  number four?  Oh, my God.  It's nothing.  It's, it's, it's bad.  Is it bad?  Listen, we'll all judge.  All right.  Another Monster Rain song.  We weren't going to go to it,  but, uh, the guys are kind of  asleep behind the scenes today,  so.  That's right, look at them. 
[01:51:30]  Look at them,  they're not even moving.  They all, you know what it is?  They want to be punished.  They need discipline.  This damn Rent Boys thing  has backfired,  now everybody's fucking off  hoping to get a reading.  Steve records the thing  in stereo.  We need the phone screened.  Isn't it obvious  we're suffering here?  Yeah, we're tired, Ben.  There's a lot of fucking people  on the phones.  I'm not even kidding anymore.  Get them on the phone, Ben.  No one is screening the calls, really.  It's like, like, slow motion.  Get my mother back on the phone,  have her do that  what's in my passing again.  We got, we got six phone lines ringing.  We got two guys that have been sitting  and, and, and it's nothing 
[01:52:00]  we want to go to.  It's boring shit.  Here's the Monster Rain song.  Tell me when to stop.  Let's give a listen.  It really is bad.  Let's listen along.  Oh, Neil Diamond.  Is it done to Neil Diamond?  Love on the porch.  So far, so good.  I was surprised. 
[01:52:30]  Little drizzle  outgave his lies.  What?  Come run with me  Before the dark  Takes the sky  It's getting a little abstract, I think.  You took my heart  You took my soul  Real lines for that. 
[01:53:00]  Gave me a little tea  Even played with my own  Innocent's gone  But I gave Jimmy  His smile  It's a little rough  Give it like 30 more seconds  Big card  First, the sky's  They're talking  Then Jimmy  Starts his talking 
[01:53:30]  Suddenly you're  Under the porch  Hiding from the storm  The fear  Makes him have you  That he wants to have you  Nothing you can do or say  Once he starts  You have to stay  It's the monster rain  This guy's all over the place  Did we end it? 
[01:54:00]  End it?  Give me what I need  Yeah, he's breaking all the rules  Makes me no choice  He's breaking all the parody rules  Yeah, he's really singing  Some parody rules are like  First of all, you've got to be able to hear what you're saying  There's a couple of lines there that are a little  Wuffled  Yeah, you couldn't really hear it  Second one  You don't use that many of the lines from the real song  Right  The guy's using too many of the real words to the song  It's like a parody slash audition for like as a real singer 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah  Neil Diamond cover band  Yeah  Well, it's dug out Doug  Did you ever come up with  He does a pretty good Neil Diamond  I'll say  Did you ever have a monster rain story?  Did you come up with one yet?  No  You heard my story, right?  No, what was yours?  Oh, you weren't listening the other day  He had the marshmallow in the frat house  Which people are saying is just as bad as the monster rain story  I was out in Arizona last week  I missed the whole show  It's one of those things where you're hazing for a fraternity  And one of the things he had to do is  Pull the pants down 
[01:55:00]  Pick up a marshmallow  Yeah  With his ass  And drop it on a little mock  A rivalry fraternity house  Frat house  And then no one ate it?  No  No, you sick ass  Well, I didn't see it  But it's a room full of guys with their pants down  See? That's it?  It's a room full of guys with their pants down  Picking up things with their buttholes  Look who says that, the guy that put a finger in my ass  Well, he didn't  Well, I guess Mike Cracky did  No, you had your pants on  Yeah, but I felt the actual shrimp haul 
[01:55:30]  The actual  Separation  Yeah, the separation  I'm guessing there's a Bob Kelly story  That bombs you?  I thought it was a little odd  That frats do things like that  And have guys in these nude circumstances doing things  Yeah, I think  There's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Yeah, there's definitely a Bob Kelly story  Now, let me just get this straight  Is it like just pure molestation?  Does it have to be a guy?  Or can it be a girl or an aunt?  No, we all have girl stories  How old would the boy be?  And how old would the aunt be?  Oh, jeez 
[01:56:00]  What the hell is an aunt?  I don't like it either  It's from Boston  I'm from aunt  It's an aunt  Aunt  What do you say, aunt?  Yeah, aunt  If I say aunt, then he's going to go what?  And then it's going to be like a whole back and forth  You know, who's on first?  Aunt  Aunt  Oh, marshmallios  Listen  My aunt, aunt  What?  What?  Aunt  I've done a couple things  I guess we were talking about things that could be bad  Yeah, you got to do the gay one  Looked at as  A little gay  A little gay  A little gay  Well, I used to  I got shards of glass in my hand 
[01:56:30]  You broke a CD and it just made shards  You alright?  Yeah, I'll be alright  That's what you get  Alright, relax  Easy  Yeah, I should settle down, huh?  Settle down  Now, what do you got down?  Why don't you settle down?  Find a girl like Henry  Tell us your gay story  It's not gay  Only the good half  It's not gay because it was young  Settle down every night, ma  It was young  You were young  Yeah, well, that's the whole Monster Ain excuse Jimmy gives  Is it's not gay because he was young  Well, it's true 
[01:57:00]  Everybody  Everybody  Four out of five young boys have done stuff with their buddies' pee-pees  When they're young  Because you don't know what sex is yet  And the fifth one watches  That's what my therapist told me  Really?  Yeah, that it's pretty natural  Really?  So when you were, how old were you?  And whatever  So I guess I'm not normal  Oh yeah, you are  You're so normal, you probably repressed it  But there's a normal memory there  I honestly couldn't give you one, though  It's gonna come out someday  I don't know  I forgot all about the marshmallow story  So I guess we'll see  I'm sure there's more in there  Alright, go ahead 
[01:57:30]  How old were you?  How old was I?  I think I was, I had to be in first grade  First grade?  First grade  That's six?  Actually, yeah  It was before first grade  My first sexual experience with a woman was in first grade  And with this chick, the Blouse  This local whore  And she made me  Whore?  Yeah, the Blouse  How old was she?  She was like, she had to be like 14  Oh  So she was older  And she took me in the bushes  Yeah  And made me suck on her tits  And then she played with my little mushroom  Like she just played with it  Wow  And I went home 
[01:58:00]  What a little whore  I actually cried all night  Because I thought God was gonna punish me  And he was going to  And he did  What a good Catholic  I remember me and my  You cried all night because of that?  Well, you know, I was raised Catholic  That's horrendous  Of course  And I didn't know she's touching me and I'm sucking  She made me do this stuff  I was molested  You were molested  And then I went home that night  And I was just crying in my bed  Just crying, praying for God  Please forgive me  I'm sorry  This is bad 
[01:58:30]  Are you kidding?  My mother actually came up  She was like, honey, what's wrong?  I was like, nothing  I'm just, you know, I had a bad dream  And I just cried all night  I just felt bad  Thank you, man  Sorry, I just had to, you know, make this story a little more fun  Porn, porn, porn  Alright, so you're crying in bed  Let dirty boy finish your story  Well, you know, it's funny  It's like a week later  I actually  You do understand it was your fault  It was my fault?  Yeah  Why?  It was your fault  She took me into the bush 
[01:59:00]  Looking all sexy  What are you expecting?  You parade that little hairless jewel around  Who wouldn't touch it for Pete's sake?  She used to take me into Tufts University  And after that, I kind of got into it  And I used to grab my friend Matthew  We used to go up into the attic of Tufts University  And just each one of us would grab  She was fat  Just fat  And huge ditch  And each one of us would just suck on a tit  Wow  Like little babies  Like little babies  You were little babies  Yeah  It was just this hot sweaty attic 
[01:59:30]  And this fat chick  And she was just sweating  And me and him would just both grab one of her huge tits  And just suck on a fleck  And was she getting pleasure out of this?  Was she moaning or something?  No, not really  She would just sit there  Sometimes she'd smoke during it  Smoke?  I swear to God  She'd just light up a cigarette  It was weird  Like she would just do it with everybody  My first three chicks were just fat white chicks  The blouse, Kimba  And some other chick  I don't remember  Kimba  Kimba, yeah  She would just  Where's the guy thing come in? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, when I was before  No, you know when I was after that  He's trying to tell chick stories  And you're like, where's the guy stuff?  Yeah  I kind of like the de Blouse story  Yeah, thanks, man  That was nice  I mean, Ope, sorry  Nice talking to you  Wanted to, you know, keep you on track  Alright  Well, you know what happened is that  Me and my friend  We would go over to  He would come over to my house  Because both of my parents worked  And my sister would be out  So we'd just lie on the couch  Uh-oh  This already sounds right  And, uh  Oh, boy  Buckle up  Buckle up  Here comes another monster rain  This is way beyond monster rain 
[02:00:30]  I can sense it  I don't know why you call it monster rain  Why don't you just call it  Sucking each other's cocks  And being friends  Well, the more  The more I look at it  The more I realize  That there probably was  No such thing as monster rain  I've come to that conclusion  Oh, really?  You're backing out of stuff now?  What are you saying?  No  I didn't know that you guys  Grew up together  No, easy  What I was saying  No, me  If me and him were buddies  When we were a kid  We'd have some  Dude, remember that time  I banged you on your ass?  All right, listen  That wasn't gay, though  I talked to my therapist  That's not gay  We just didn't know any better  We're friends, you know  We didn't know 
[02:01:00]  All right, so  So you and your friend  Would lie on the couch  We'd lie on the couch  Just before I  How old was he?  Uh, 13  How old were you?  No, I'm joking  He was, uh, ah, shit  We'd had to be  We had to be  How old are you in 5th grade?  How old are you in 5th grade?  11  I don't know  It depends what color you are  No, not 11  11?  No, it wasn't 11  What color you are?  Oh, my God  You were 11 years old  Hang on, I didn't even hear that  Nice  That's so bad  That's good  Um  You were 11  I wasn't 11  Opie, it's not 11  Because I was in  You graduate 6th grade 
[02:01:30]  You're 12 years old, right?  Yeah  Yeah  So you're 11 in 5th grade  It must have been  You were 11  4th grade then  I wasn't 11  Because I started drinking at 11  10 or 11  And I wasn't drinking then  Of course you started drinking  This is before you started drinking  This is my first addiction  This is my first addiction  Then I moved on to booze  Memories  So what happened when you were  Almost a teenager  Laying on the couch  You lie on the couch  We just lie there  And this is when  Remember when you first started  Jerking off  You used Vaseline  Yes  Remember like petroleum jelly  Sure 
[02:02:00]  You'd like waterproof your dick  For like 3 days  Yes  Just jump in the shower  To wash it off  And it would just beat up  Yeah  Just looking for anything  Slippery at that age  Didn't matter  Run around like a monkey  Just looking what?  Pancake batter?  I don't care  Whatever works  I jerk off with anything  Anything  Anything  I used to jerk off  With the Juergens  And I'd fuck the sink  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that  If you ever want to jerk off  And it feels like  You're fucking somebody  You get on  You know the big long sinks

[02:03:00]  It's unbelievable  You are a genius  Oh it's unbelievable  It really feels like  You're fucking somebody  I swear to god  You're not going to be able  To look at a sink ever again  No  That is brilliant  Because there's no clean up  You're getting  You're able to use  Your whole body in it  You open your eyes  And you're looking right at yourself  In the mirror  How fucking creepy is that?  As a fat bald chick  I'm fucking  I got caught in rehab  When I went to rehab  I got caught fucking the sink  I used to fuck the sink 
[02:03:30]  During our group sessions  Because I know everybody  Was in the group  So one time I guess  Somebody snapped in group  And they had to end group early  And I'm in the bathroom  Fucking the sink  And there was like a crack  In the door  And all of a sudden  I just hear giggling  And like all ten guys  From my rehab house  Oh man  Were in there  They were just watching me  Fuck the sink  It was just awful  So you still do that?  I haven't done it  Because I have a pedestal sink now  You can't do that  Yeah you can't do that  I'm too fat to balance myself  On a pedestal sink  But yeah I've done it 
[02:04:00]  I've done it in hotel rooms  You ever go in the hotels  You have to go in the cheesy hotels  But the suite  In like a cheesy hotel  Always has that big long counter  With one sink  Little sink in the middle  Perfect  Just jump up on top  You lube your hand up  Don't  Don't lube your dick up  No?  No because you want to lube  Just the inside of your hand  Put it on there  And then when you push it in  It's like cracking the seal  Of a real pussy  What the hell is going on?  You want a little resistance  You want a little resistance  Because it cracks it  And you're like  Oh  And it feels like 
[02:04:30]  You're cracking the seal  Of a stink wrinkle  Just as it's going in  Oh it's unbelievable  Right now there's a sink  In therapy somewhere  I just wanted to clean people  And help  And wash them  And this fat kid  Would climb on  And put his dinghy  In my face  Well  I was in the bathroom  Where I usually am  And the lights came on  These are great distractions  So what happened  With the guy  On the couch  Yeah it's true  So you were almost a teenager  Naked with another boy  And you pretended  There's no naked  Wait a minute

[02:24:30]  Yeah  I flew on his jet  A couple times  But when I could get  On the bus with the crew  Because the crew  Was phenomenal  Yeah  I'll ride with the crew  And meet you there  You don't want to fly in the jet  No I don't  Did the crew just  Bad mouth the guy  All the time  Everyone fucking hates  Isn't he getting sued  For some  Young girl stuff  He's always in  Always in some shit  Fucking court  Is his part time job  He's got  He's gotten off  On a lot of those  Underage things  He got off  On one of those 
[02:25:00]  And a lot of the ones  Where the girls said  They didn't sign  Consent forms  Or shit like that  Yeah lawyer money  I don't see anything  About it  And the guy  Is so fucking  Filthy rich  Is he really  Like I don't know  Who's buying those things  They just don't look  Like something  You want to buy  And pop in the  In the CD player  You know we're buying them  And it's just a guess  But it's all  You know  People who  The Christian right  In the middle of this country  That you assume  Doesn't really exist  In that many numbers 
[02:25:30]  But once he got it on TV  And made porn okay  Like that's  That was his  His brilliance  Was making porn  It's the only  Even pseudo porn  That they sell  On television  And it was pretty  Like it got pretty  Heavy duty  What they show  In the infomercials  One thing  But you know  There's pussy in there  Right  Yeah but that way  The guys that you  Don't think still exist  That have to lie  To their wives  About watching porno  Yeah  They can justify that 
[02:26:00]  By going  It was on TV  I bought this on TV man  You bought that  Fucking exercise machine  Yeah  You know  Why can't I buy something  Oh that's great  Yeah and that's why  They have fucking  Snoop Dogg  Or comics  A host of things  So then they can say  I just wanted  For the comedy  I love Snoop Dogg  I'm a big rap fan  Hey Doug  We got to ask you  About that baiting thing  You do  Oh yeah  With the pedophiles  And I think you go  After the abortion people 
[02:26:30]  Too right  Yeah  We got a book deal  Now we're going  To put it into a book  Oh really  That's awesome  Yeah  Basically he goes online  And baits pedophiles  And stuff  And then what  You just have the  Conversations on your website  It's basically  Like a prank phone call  Only it's on  Instant messenger  Where you bait  Pedophiles  Into thinking  You're a 13 year old girl  And then you just  Fuck with him  Because once you get  A guy jacking off  Yeah  Then you can fuck  With him as much  As you want  And you know  So if you're  Fucking a girl  And then right in the middle  She goes  I think I have herpes 
[02:27:00]  You're going to keep  Fucking her  This is already starting  Do you need a consent  Form to do that?  Hmm  Consent form  Like to  Like say  Some dudes  Publish it  Like you know  To put some dude  On the thing  That's like  You know  Talking to a 13 year old girl  And you're like  No  All I have to do  Is change the screen name  And you're in  Oh you just  You don't even  You don't acknowledge  It's him  No  Being a beginner lawyer  I would assume  That's the only thing  You need to do  To save your ass  Go ahead Doug  Sorry  For legal reasons 
[02:27:30]  When we put it  Into a book  We'll have to  Change their screen name  And own the domain  Or own the screen name  Now why is that?  Well because  Defamation is  Anytime  If you  Accuse someone  Of doing something  Illegal  Then you can get  Sued for defamation  I already went  Through this once  Can't you just  Put it down  And say  This is how it went down  Here's the screen name  This is  It's all fact  It happened  The point is  Like I had  A frivolous lawsuit  Some guy  I said 
[02:28:00]  Was a fucking  Crackhead  On my website  Yeah  The way you'd say  Yeah you're a fucking  Crackhead  Shut up  But because  I said crackhead  That insinuates  He's doing something  Illegal  Where he sued me  For whatever  A fucking  Quarter of a million dollars  And it got thrown out  Because it was frivolous  But it cost me  Ten grand in legal fees  To get it thrown out  The whole justice system  Is so fucked like that  Isn't crackhead  Like you could call  Someone crackhead  In the same way  You would a douchebag  And he wouldn't say  I'm not a actual douchebag 
[02:28:30]  Like crackhead  Has become something  You could just  You know  Someone's acting  Like a fucking lunatic  You say  This guy's a fucking crackhead  I don't clean out  Women's vaginas  Last time  I was never there  In a woman's pussy  Cleansing  With some kind of  Vinegar and water  But if he was  In that pussy  Cleaning it out  That's not illegal  It's the letter  Of the law  If you insinuate  He's done something  Illegal  Like smoke  Crack  Then you're open  For defamation suits  It's a $10,000 lesson 
[02:29:00]  I learned  Oh that's wonderful  So now I know  To call them douchebags  Instead of crackheads  Someone's calling me out  That I said  CD player  Instead of DVD player  I called that too  And he's like  He capitalized it  And said I'm a fucking tool  John Holmes  Sure it's his real name  From Beverly Hills  Uh  Banned  All right  Do they have to  I can understand  If I said  I put it in my toaster  And watched it on fucking 
[02:29:30]  I can understand  If I said something like that  I did  CD player  So you know Doug  When I  You know  You get those  Things  And you put it  In your transmission  Of your car  And watch it  I can understand  If I did something  Like that  I mixed up CD  Our fucking listeners  Are the most nitpickiest  John Holmes  Is a crackhead  And I don't mean  That figuratively  Literally  He was smoking crack  This morning  You cocksucker  Hate our listeners

[02:48:00]  Yes  And if he walked in the door  You'd go  Wow, that's Andrew Dice Clay  Oh, that's harsh, man  Oh, now you've gone too far  I've got to revert back to  Last week's shows, everyone  It's easier to recognize  Like a quick flash in the pen character  Than it is  You know  Well, okay, here  Everybody knows Judy Tenuta  And not David Tell  You know, David Tell's the steady  Strong guy  Yeah, David Tell  I probably would only know him though  Andrew Dice Clay  Because of his voice  You know  Right  Yeah  Okay, honey 
[02:48:30]  Sure  I can't tell you what he looks like  But I know his voice  You don't know what he looks like?  Eddie, Eddie  I mean, I know he's got dark hair  In general  I know you've been locked in a house  For 90 days  That was on camera  Where were you locked before that?  I was going to say  No, I'm going to take you  But I'm sure you grew up  In a freaking Skinner box  I mean, seriously  I didn't really have  I mean, I just  I worked  Skinner box  I went to school  And I don't know  The penthouse pet's the only one  In the room that got the reference  That's why we love you  Liz Thomas, penthouse pet  So there you go, Brittany  That's Jay Moore  Jim Norton, what's going on?  Hey  What's up, guys? 
[02:49:00]  How you doing?  Hey, Norton  Hey, Norton  As far as what Jay does for a living  The entire country  Has been asking that question  For three years  And as far as not seeing you  In Jerry Maguire  Apparently she didn't have  A freeze frame on her DVD  Oh, man  Wow  Oh, boy  Wow  You're quiet, buddy  Wow  You stopped him in his tracks  With that one, Jim  He's awful about me 
[02:49:30]  When I'm not there  So I have to  Take things out  Quickly  That's not true  That's not true  When you're not here  I always say  You're funnier than Dice  I'll see you guys later, man  I just wanted to call real quick  And I just wanted to find out  Who this person was  Hey, Jim  Yeah  Go f*** yourself  F, it's F  Right  He doesn't understand the rules here  I'll see you guys later  See you, Jimmy  We definitely got to take a break  Jim Norton  Very funny man  All right  Why don't we take a break  Sounds good  All right  It's the worst  It's the worst 
[02:50:00]  The worst  Whoopi  We had it out  With Whoopi yesterday  And then last night  She was on CNN  Do you think the two-week suspension  Is enough for Don Imus?  I know we'll find out  We'll find out  I mean, he's gonna luck out  Isn't he, really?  How do you mean?  Well, you know  When Rush Limbaugh  Said something untoward  On the television  When he was a sportscaster  He was gone  The other sportscaster  Who cast aspersions  On the Spanish player 
[02:50:30]  Said he was concerned  His wallet might not be there  He was gone  Jimmy the Greek  He was gone  So if all Don Imus gets  Is two weeks  I think he's getting off  Rather well  Because everyone else  Including Trent Lott  You know  Got busted down  For saying stuff  Wow  Comic, you idiot  Comic  Who didn't get in trouble  For saying stuff?  Dave Chappelle  And every  White comedian  So why are you putting him  In the class  With people who are  Sportscasters 
[02:51:00]  Who went outside  Sportscasters  Are not supposed to make  Racial jokes  No  They're sportscasters  Comic comedians  And comedy radio personalities  Are supposed to make  Racial jokes  They're supposed to  Involve humor  Yes  That would be like  If Brian Williams  Of NBC Nightly News  Made a racial joke  He'd be fired  Why?  Because he's a news anchor  Sportscasters  That is outside  What they're supposed to do  And they know that  If Jay Leno  During his monologue  Made a racial joke  He wouldn't get fired  He didn't make a racial joke  It was a brilliant racial joke 
[02:51:30]  Because he's a comedian  Hosting a show  Where he gets up there  And does comedy monologues  Isn't it amazing  That Whoopi doesn't see it  This way?  No one sees the context  Of this  Another phony  Another phony outrage  By the black community  That was just  Whoopi being phony  About how angry she is  And where is all  Of this focus on rap  If you want to go after  Somebody who has  Influence in the black community  Don't just give your  Bullshit summits  Or your stupid lip service  We encourage our community 
[02:52:00]  To not buy rap lyrics  Fight to have them  Unemployed  The way you're doing  With Imus  Yep  Alright with that said  She goes on  It's kind of funny to me  That people are  Shocked and surprised  That people are calling  Really for Imus' head  You know  But the precedent  Has been set  That there is  A certain standard  With broadcasting  Now if you're on a stage  And you're doing  A routine  You have a lot  We say there should be  No difference  Why is that difference 
[02:52:30]  God Whoopi  In a freedom of speech issue  With being an entertainer  Why would you  In a convenient place  Where you perform  Expect a certain freedom  A certain license  That others don't have  How about as a musician  Yeah  You have it there  An author  A poet  Right  Everyone has it  But broadcasters  Yeah where are the places  You have freedom of speech  And where are the places  You don't  As an actor you do  As a comedian on stage  You do  As a singer you do  As a writer you do 
[02:53:00]  In a play you do  But not as a broadcaster  I don't get it  Yeah on the radio  No  With that we say hi to  Jay Moore  Hiya boys  Holy  Oh my god  I'm bowing to the microphone  It's fucking Jay Moore  Oh my god  Jay Moore  Hi Jay  God  You're telling me  The dime  It says these girls  Are nappy headed hoes  That's your story  You're sticking to it  That's what you're telling me  Bitches ain't shit  But hoes and trick

[02:57:30]  Yep  And Coulter  Yeah  Billy Packer  Yep  Billy Packer  And Charlie Rose said  I want you to come  To the final four  But you always  Sag out on me  And everyone  Wanted him to apologize  And he said  Not only will I not apologize  I'll probably say it again  Good see  And then  It goes away  Because they go  Oh  He's not going to  Fucking apologize  We're not going to  Get any press out of it  So fuck it  Imus went on  A whole apology tour  He's sucking up  To everybody  And they still  Want his head  But don't you think 
[02:58:00]  Imus now  Has lost any credibility  Like when he goes  Back on the air  Who's going to  It's like  It's like watching  Your friend get his  Ass kicked  That you thought  Was so tough  Oh no  He's castrated now  It's my bodyguard  It's that movie  My bodyguard  Leave him alone  Moody  Moody  I love Ruth Gordon  I just wanted  Linderman to rape her  At razor point  Is this your bike  Well hold on  Wow  Okay hold on  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame on you

[03:01:30]  It's probably just cause  Last year sucked  Yeah  Yeah I know  Good point  Good point  And other people saying  It didn't have a big opening episode  Because this was actually  Part of last season  It's like the middle of last season  I loved it  I loved it  I loved it  I loved it  They woke up  And she just goes  Is this it  Well boys  I just wanted  To tell you I love you  When are you gonna be  In New York again sweetie  Well  I'll visit Matt Dillon  At eateries  Who knows  I'll be on the next jet

[03:14:30]  It's awful  Tracy knows  Hey did you hear  Rich Voss' audio  Of his wife giving birth  I got excited about that  You got excited  Why  Yeah  This is the thing  With me and pregnant women  It's one time  He doesn't have to pay  Child support  She was moaning and groaning  I'm old school  Like she's being punished  Wasn't that something  Kind of exciting about hearing  Bonnie moan  That's why I watched porno  You know  Even in pain  The punishment  Yeah  You know  Even in pain  There was something kind of cool 
[03:15:00]  About her moaning  You know  I love pregnant women anyway  I love to watch a pregnant woman anyway  Because then you know that  Somebody left it in  Wow somebody left it in  And that right there in itself  Is exciting because it's 2007  You can't leave it in  You can't even go raw  No  And I love raw  Your philosophy is  I love raw  A bit different  That's what excites you  I'm an old schooler  I love raw  By the way the morning  I can't watch porno  When they use condoms  I'll be like  Why would you 
[03:15:30]  If both guys are safe  It's like  It's whack  It's whack  Guess what Jim  I did a movie  Independent movie  With Olivia O'Lovely  Was she a porn girl?  Latin booty talk 29  Latin  Latin booty talk 29  They're up to 29  Yeah  I left that series after 27  I felt the art direction became sloppy  Are you serious?  Yes  Latin booty  Latin booty talk  Too much makeup  Too much glamour 
[03:16:00]  Yeah it was just very poorly directed  No stretch marks  Whack  They're really up to 29 of those  Yeah  My god  No they're up to like 36  Oh really?  Yeah  37's being filmed today  Yeah  And it's done  My son  My oldest son be watching my porn man  Really?  How old is he now?  He's ashamed to admit it  But I know he is  Because I know where I left to take  How old is he now?  He's like 21  Oh okay  He's itching against him too  He's itching  You make a good point though  You know where you left to take  I know where I left it 
[03:16:30]  I know what woman I left it on  Well we've talked about this on the show  You watch porn 10-15 minutes at a time  So you know where you left off  Man I got many screens going on  I'm getting cake  I work with y'all  What do you got like Scarface security screens  With just porno playing on it?  Yes  Pick and choose which one you want to get  My wife is so mad at me man  Women get so mad  Because you know you try to hide it all over the place  And she found one of my daughter's easy bake oven  You hit it in there? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah  Then I took the  I took the label off  And put Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on it  Yeah  And my nephew was watching it  And it blew his mind  And she said  He might end up like Ted Bundy  He's being exposed too early  And she found one of them pornos  In my daughter's easy bake oven  People freak out when the kids accidentally see porno  It's educational  If somebody screws up down at Blockbuster  And remember when people used to return like porno tapes 
[03:17:30]  And put it in like the kids section  Disney movies  And then they'd rent it out  Pop it in  And the parent would leave  They'd hear some strange noises  Come into the room  And the kid is just sitting there  Eyes wide open  Just staring at hardcore pornography  And then they'd want to sue  They'd want to freak out  Therapy  Leave the kid alone  Don't make a big deal about it  Let him finish the movie  It's better than American Idol  Yeah  American Idol leads people down a wrong path 
[03:18:00]  You know because what's karaoke without the booze man  That's pretty much what it is  That's whack  Karaoke without the booze  Saying that you should be able to drink on American Idol  American Idol man  Let's see what's really going on  You know you do sound better after a few beers  That would be a great deal  When you're doing karaoke  Let's see who got talent  There's a curve though  Few beers  You sound good  Good  Good  Good  One beer  Too many  Wham  It drops  It drops off  Let's see who got talent  And you sound like crap  But that's when it gets to be good TV 
[03:18:30]  To watch  To let them drink as much as they want  Do a karaoke show  You do karaoke  Somebody's pulling a tan out  Have they done a karaoke reality show yet  They've tried that one too  Yeah  I wouldn't get into it  Nah  They did something I think on MTV or something  Too many ringers  Remember putting on the hits  American Idol was ringers  Putting on the hits  Yeah what the hell was the gist of that  Hey so Hot Rod was here yesterday  The guy with lip sync  Yeah  The guy with lip sync  You got Hot Rod here yesterday  Wait wait wait  I'm SNL  Those two  Yeah we're just having a conversation 
[03:19:00]  Those two were talking  What was that song  Putting on the hits from the 80s  The show  If you're blue  You don't know what to go to  Put on the hits  Put on the hits  The show I think  Was that what it was called  Was the guy with lip sync  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  He was a blonde boy  Yeah it was a lip syncing show  He was awful  He was trying to be funny  It was a blonde boy  And a black dude  Was it  Nah I just made that up  Oh  He was just guessing  Yeah we had Hot Rod guy in  Two days ago 
[03:19:30]  Andy  Andy was in here  Sandberg  They ripped him a new a-hole  A day in the papers man  Yeah  The movie got one star today  We were hoping that he would  Get a little better review than that  See  Andy next time  Put me in it brother  You know I'm the  I'm the black utility guy  That was my role on SNL  You're the go-to  I was the utility guy  You started getting characters  I come clean up  Yeah  Brian Fellow  You started getting characters  I started to get  I became a franchise  Yep 
[03:20:00]  It's about franchise brother  I don't like that bird  No that bird got double eyes  That bird took my credit card  And he just holds up the rubber boobie  We have here  Yeah we got those from Jill  Jill Nicolini brought those in for us  So by the way  Is this like a real one?  That's one that they kind of stick in the bra  Yeah  They don't put that under the skin  Booty Talk's up to 77  Booty Talk 77?  They got 77 of them  77 
[03:20:30]  Oh you gotta get into that series man  That series is awesome  Yeah  Yo I went to the Bunny Ranch  You did?  Yeah  We sent some of our listeners there  Weren't you in here last time?  Yeah  When homeboy got on  Yeah  He got lifted  He got lifted a little bit  That was the time before  But this last time  We took two guys  That are having marital problems  And shipped them off  To the Bunny Ranch  To get some action  One guy hadn't had sex with his wife  For 12 years 
[03:21:00]  12?  Yeah  12 years  And his wife  We got her on the phone  And she was just like  I don't care  I don't want it  I don't need it  And we're like  Well you know something  Your husband does  What happens to people  What happens to the ladies  When they stop wanting to put out?  I don't know  I'm gone man  If my marriage ever goes south like that  My love life ever  See you gotta role play  You shouldn't have to pay  You gotta role play man  I mean that  You gotta role play  You gotta keep it creative  Like I bought my wife 
[03:21:30]  A Girl Scout outfit  Yeah  Yeah  I told her to go outside  I bought her the wig  You know  Two ponytails  Then I told her to go outside  And knock on the door  Try to sell me some cookies  I'm gonna come to the door  With my boxes  And my junk hanging out  She committed too  She was like  Man so you wanna buy  Some butter crunch cookies?  And I was like  Yeah  Come on in there  Let me get a couple of boxes from you  Buy a couple of boxes  Then after we  After I laid up  We ate the cookies 
[03:22:00]  You know  Really went the distance  Got the cookies and everything  It'd be funny if you just bought the cookies in Central Lake  Yeah  My homeboy played  He played  He played with his girlfriend  They play a game called rape  Really?  Yeah  Yeah  Some people are into that fantasy  He said this woman  Want him to  Take it by force  Yeah  That's her thing  She likes to take it by force  That is a fetish  That some women have  I'm gonna stick to the Girl Scouts  We've taken a lot of calls  About that very subject 
[03:22:30]  Over the years  It's odd  Because the actual thing  The actual crime  Is such a violent thing  But there are some women  That fantasize about it  He told me  He told me  Yeah  He told me  I looked at him like he was crazy  He told me that  This is what his lady likes  They just wanna be taken  They don't want the violence of rape  They only want the idea  Of it being taken by force  Of being sexualized  And used  And being against their will  But they don't want the violence of it  It's just about having sex against your will  Yeah but what guy  Like  It would be  I think it would be  It ain't the guy 
[03:23:00]  Sometimes it's the woman  I love that  Yeah but I think it would be odd  If the woman's into it  To actually find the guy into it  Would be a hell of a coincidence  Yeah I'm not with that man  I'm not with  Nah  Nah  Take him off  I'm a finesse type of guy  That kind of  Almost tells me she wants somebody else  When I have sex with my woman  I don't bang  You know I'm more of a grind  I'm old school  I'm a grind  Yeah  I'm a grind  You got some slow  Pimping moves  I'm a moaning and groaning  Hey could you put  Could you put  Richard's voices  Of the pregnancy on  While I grind  You want to hear Bonnie 
[03:23:30]  Hold on  Hold on  Let me help out  Tracy  Let me grind to it  There's a difference  When you bang  And then when you grind  This is a turn on  To Tracy  I gotta do it  I'm sorry Rich  In the meantime  Bonnie giving birth  In the meantime  We'll just have Bob Kelly moaning  Here we go  What's that?  Where was y'all  In the kitchen or something?  No we're white  It's like 
[03:24:00]  I had pots being banged  Yeah  Easy bake fryer going on  Well my wife gave birth  To all my sons man  What she would do  And she's like  So experienced  Like when  Like  If I wasn't there  Like if I was at  Like my girlfriend's house  While she was going  Into contractions  Then her mother  Would call me  Like  Wake me up  At like 6 in the morning 
[03:24:30]  I'd be in the bed  With my girlfriend  She'd be like  Yo wife  You better get over here  Your wife is going  Into contractions  And I'd be like  Oh  Oh well  I'd jump up  And put my pants on  And my girlfriend  Be like  Where you going?  I'd be like  My wife is having birth  She's giving birth  So  Did you grab the  Girl Scout cookies?  Here's the thing  About role playing  You ever do role playing  And you become a character  And she's a character  But then she asks  For that character  The next time  And you get jealous  Of the character  That you are  You know 
[03:25:00]  You're Tom one night  And the next night  She goes  Where's Tom?  And you're going  What's Tom got  That I don't have?

So we'd ring the bell for the round  And they would come out from their corners  But they obviously can't see each other 
[03:55:00]  And they would walk right by each other  But they got the boxing stance  You know how when you're boxing  You gotta kind of  Weed back and forth  And throw that jab and stuff  Sure  They were doing that to thin air  While they were standing back to back with each other  At one point  The one guy was facing the other guy's back  Yeah, they were walking in single file  Down the ring  Like they're getting ready to do a feud  They gotta like pace off  And then turn around and shoot each other  They were all stealthy though  This is great  So yeah  Knowing left Anthony  Brought the boxers down to the studio yesterday

[03:56:30]  Don't you do that  Don't you  I got no place else to go  I got no place else to go  You know that's not true  You have never showed up here without bringing something  Yes I have  I've been here before  You deserve it  Every time you do well in the ratings  We give you some  And notice  Notice  Last time he came in with Bob's Champagne  Right  And we were all pissed off  He had like  Hey try Bob's Champagne  He's kicked it up a notch  And now 
[03:57:00]  Because  We bitched and complained  He brings a bottle of Dom  So my budget is getting  To come in here  We were still drinking out of paper cups though  It says Dom  Right over Bob's Champagne  It was that label feeling  Scratched out with a blagic marker  You misspelled Dom  What in the world  I like the defense though  That's not true  That's the kind of defense attorney you'd want  Like if you were ever  My client  That's not true  That's not true 
[03:57:30]  That's what they say  I rest my case  Because it's not true  Say something  You're like that  You're the defendant  Say something  That's not true  Don't say that  They're more seasoned than I am  I can't talk that well  Don't  Don't  Don't  Don't you  Say that  If you can't talk  Then why are you putting headphones on  And sitting in front of a microphone  You know that  I'd like to sit back  And you'll notice  Anything remotely funny  He will break out  In a laugh 
[03:58:00]  That is so  Completely annoying  It completely ruins  Any funny moment  That just happened  He has one of those sitcom laughs  You know when you're watching a sitcom  There's always that one guy  The cam laugh  And you hear that whole  Like the  The rumble  But then in the back  He's the guy  The tail off laugh  Of the cam laughter  Big money in that 
[03:58:30]  Being the tail off laugher  The tail off laugher  You're better than just the other cam laugh people  Making the rounds  Of all the audiences  Out in the TV tapings  You know  I'm going to stop  The tail off laugh  You got a gig man  It's cool  Now where's the cops there  I didn't  No I just walked in with the champagne  Get the cops  Go grab some paper cups  Can't you see Brian needs a drink  No I'm cool man  I love that

[03:59:30]  That's all encompassing  You know  You can say that about Charles Manson  He had his own take on things  Well why don't you ask him  What do you think of Charles Manson  Well you know  I mean  The guy  He was wrong  In his thinking  You know  An independent thinker  He meant well  I would say that  What he did was inappropriate  But he meant well right  He just  It just came across 
[04:00:00]  The wrong way  The butcher of Barbie  Well you know  As far as butchers go  He had something to say  But he said it in a very bad way  You know  Matilda the Hun  Right  Well you know  As far as Huns go  Don't lock him out  When he's bringing the cups  We have to use him  For his champagne at least  Yeah  Get him back in the studio  Let him in  Just so he could pour the champagne  I had to apologize  To Brian Regan again  We should tell you  Why is that  Well  People need to know 
[04:00:30]  When Brian's around  We all go and see him  Because we have a lot  Of comedians in here  And we don't see everybody  But with Brian  When he's in the area  Even if it's a hassle  We go and see him  It's very flattering  So we've probably gone to  I don't know  10 or 12 shows  Of Brian's  Over the last couple of years  I happen to be in Boston  A couple months back  What the hell you said  He's already started  I want to go see him  He's  Alexei  This is what he does  I said I  I've never seen him  That's all I said 
[04:01:00]  I was talking to my son  But I hope he's talking  On to the listeners  And you're just  I didn't think he would hear me  Holy ass  You wait  This is what he does  He's one of these guys  He's one of these guys  That doesn't fully understand  That we're trying to do  A radio show  And when we talk  He thinks we're talking to him  He thinks it's just like  We're in a room  And we're just talking  Amongst ourselves  And he can chime in  It should be like  At one of those  White House press conferences  You know  Where like Bush  Is starting to say  You know that's a good idea  I was thinking about the budget  I think I would learn 
[04:01:30]  After two and a half years  What do you got  Six cups for that  Bottle of Dom  You didn't even get  The big magnum bottle  We're going to have rations  Like in the desert  When they only have one canteen  What the hell  And why are you bringing  A champagne  Did you not beat  Mike and the Mad Dog  In the ratings  You've been beating them  For years now  That was easy  Every time your ratings  Go up I come in  What's the problem  You don't want me in now  Again  Don't piss them off  Until I get my champagne  The ratings  How many years  It's the same crap  Stop  Don't do

[04:06:00]  The whole family  You have to call the seat  Right  You call the seat  When you get in your car  As a kid  You're going  Out on vacation  You know  And you get the  Shotgun  You know  That's front seat  Sure  Shotgun  And then  But I had the three older brothers  I knew where I was going to sit  So I would just pretend  Like I wanted it  You know  I was like  Back seat  Back seat  In the middle  With my feet on the hump  I called it  I got the hump  My parents were like  He's calling the hump  Walt  He shouldn't want the hump  As long as they ain't fighting 
[04:06:30]  Hump's good  Right Brian  Oh the hump's good  You like the hump  I love the hump  I'm the hump boy  I'm riding the hump  To Disney World  I don't know why  You call anything anyway  You know  My first day in school  I thought you're supposed  To like call things  Like all the time  You know  And my first day in school  I was like  I call this desk  And the teacher's like  Yes we all do Brian  And I'm like grabbing onto it  Looking around  Like somebody's going to  Take it from me  I call this desk 
[04:07:00]  Yes we call it desk too  I call it  I call it desk  I call this desk  It's very good  Hey we're just getting  Started with Brian Regan  You're like simulcast  You're getting all over  The  Oh yes we are  It's spreading  Do you have to like  Be vague with the times 
[04:07:30]  And everything now  Do you got to do  It's half past the hour  Half past the hour  Yeah we got to do that  Well know why the show  Works in other cities  Because we never did time  Never did weather  Never did traffic  Never did news  We just hang  Because no one cares  It's ten after something  And there's some traffic  Out there  Right  All right  In your city  Now for the forecast  In your city  And they got to go away  To the local guy  No we don't have to do that 
[04:08:00]  People have watches  And so they know the time  I never got that anyway  What do they got to tell you  The time on the radio for  You know you're driving around  For eight minutes  Going I wonder what time  Why won't these  Disc jockeys  Tell me what time it is  I got to get to work  And they're just talking  About everything but the time  I might be late  And I need to know  The temperature  I mean I know I got  From my house  Into the car  So I probably have 
[04:08:30]  A rough idea  I need to know exactly  And I want to know  The traffic  Even though I'm sitting in it  Why do they do all that  I don't know  We try not to  Because they have  Nothing else to talk about  Yeah  That's why  Mike  Yeah what's up  Hey  Brian what's going on  Hey Mike  How are you man  All right  I was just sitting down  Watching TV  And there was a monster  Truck race on  I don't know  I know that's like  One of your favorite things  Oh man  You know  As a matter of fact 
[04:09:00]  Hey Brian  Take luck man  Take luck and care  You got the best listeners man  I remember  They're like smooth as silk  It's their monster truck show Brian  Go  Well I know what it is  They were sick of me  Doing the awkward setup  Yeah  They're like screw that  We'll do it ourselves  Well you've seen them right  The TV monster trucks  Oh yeah  The favorite  The best part is  When they interview them  They interview them  When the whole race 
[04:09:30]  Or whatever they're doing  I don't know if it's a race  Or an activity  I don't know what they're  Trying to accomplish  But when they're done  They interview the guys  And they always talk  About their engine  Like you know  What they're talking about  Hey what were you thinking  During that last run  Or all  Well you know  I was going pretty good  And about halfway through  The flap coil valve  Burner started smoking  The hydro pin spring  Was sparting oil  At the manifold draft  I knew if I didn't  Over flood the gasket  I'm going to have that last pile  On an unplanned transmission valve  I knew if I couldn't do that  I was going to have to  Shut her down  You know you're at home 
[04:10:00]  What  Wait the flap coil  Burner  The  Well sure  You had to shut her  What options did you have  Your hydro plate spring  Was  Was  Was  Sparting transmission oil  You had to shut her down  You're like an idiot  Right  Why don't we take a break  We'll be back with  The Opie and Anthony show  Stay there  It's the worst  Of the Opie and Anthony show 
[04:10:30]  We're back with  The Opie and Anthony show  Hanging with Brian Regan today  Hey Brian  You into the  Drowning pool  Sure  Who can't enjoy  A little drowning  Every now and then  It's the band  Drowning pool  Oh that's the band  I thought you  You guys do such weird stuff  I thought maybe you had a pool out  In the lobby  We're drowning people in  You know  You got blind guys boxing  We're going to drown some people  Out in our drowning pool

[04:12:30]  Oh my god  Why did you have to tell  Everyone you're leaving  We're setting something up  Right in the middle of it  And he just says  I'll be leaving now  I'm departing  You know the weird thing is  We didn't even notice  You were there  Until you opened your mouth  I know that  I thought I was off  So you're not leaving  He says he's leaving  He gets on a chair  And pulls up  And puts his headphones on  I'm not that familiar  With the whole leaving concept  But I was always  Under the impression 
[04:13:00]  I meant  You're going somewhere else  I'm leaving  Hey  Alright  Where's my headphones  Let me pull up a chair  Alright  I've left  I gotta stay soon  What are you doing  You're not feeling loved  Or something  You want to ask  Brian Regan something  You have tickets for me  Yeah man  I'll take care of you  Cool  Sure  You and your wife  Sure  Wife, girlfriend  Girlfriend  Okay  I got 20 more people  Yeah about 10  Five more tickets  Six more tickets  Good  Anthony was in the middle

[04:14:00]  Nine, eight  Buckle up everyone  Brian's going to be very funny  Five, four, three  Oh my gosh  Is this going to be funny  Humor sequence initiated  Two, one  Alright I would love to know  What's going on  In Brian's head though  When he goes  No it's okay  He's a good guy  He's a good guy  Son of a bitch  Son of a bitch  I met you  And I was saying  I'm leaving  Never mind  He made me stay  Oh my god  Anthony what were you saying  Like silence in here 
[04:14:30]  Oh my god  Anthony let's see if we can't just  I don't know  Be quiet for the segment  There we go  Alright  I saw a blue thing on 57th  It was blue  You want to talk about that  I've never seen anything so blue  I'm driving along  You know  We're at 55th  We're at 56th  I'm like  I haven't seen a blue thing yet  We come on 57th  And it's blue  My god  There's a blue thing right there  Alright  I think the people tuning in late 
[04:15:00]  Going what the  What the hell's the blue thing  I don't  Scott's asking  I don't know why  But I'm about to leave work  I need to eat  And I have a Pop-Tart sitting here  And can't figure out  How to cook it  I know you know  A little something about it  Can you help me  Scott  You know  As a matter of fact Scott  You know  I do know a little bit about that  Because I was looking at  A Pop-Tarts box recently  And what you have to do  You have to look at the directions  They have directions on there for you  Which is very helpful  You know  Because you know 
[04:15:30]  If they weren't on there  You'd take the box  You'd just set it down  And you'd just be like  How do I get that goodness in me  Where do you go  How do you begin  Well you look at the directions  They have two sets  They got the toaster directions  Which are longer than one step  That's what kills me  There's more than one step  For toaster directions  You'd think at most  There would be one step  That was like  Toast the Pop-Tarts  Go ahead 
[04:16:00]  Toast them  Hey are you still reading this  But you know  You've got the box  Look at the box  They've broken them down  In the smaller increments  These are some of the actual steps  Step one  Number one  Remove pastry from pouch  Oh  Alright let me get them  Out of the pouch  Okay  I see where they're going  With this  We're banging on all cylinders  Now we got them  Out of the pouch 
[04:16:30]  Number two  Insert pastry  Vertically  Oh  And your brain explodes  You know  You're reading toaster directions  You're going to understand  The vertical concept  But if you don't have time  For that  They got the microwave  Direction Scott  That you can microwave  And I swear  On the box  It says  Microwave on high  For three seconds  Three  I don't think I want to  Wake up and be eaten  In three seconds 
[04:17:00]  You know  Your alarm goes off  Your head pops off  Your pillow  You put them in  Bing  You take a bite  I gotta get out of here  If you're waking  Eating and hauling  In three seconds  You're booking yourself  Too tight  Got that Scott  I hope that helped  I don't know if that helped you  Scott  I hope that helped out  It's interesting  You would have a question like that  I know  Out of nowhere  Mike what's going on  What's up  ONA  Congratulations on the ratings  Oh thank you  Thank you sir  We were more gooder  This time around  A lot more gooder 
[04:17:30]  A lot more gooder  Brian two things  Yes  One I just had pizza  Again the people calling  To tell us what they ate  For no apparent reason  Whatsoever  And Brian  I just joined the health club  And I was wondering  If you ever joined the health club  You know  Okay  It's funny you would ask that  Because  No of course  You know  Everybody joins them  But they always have  The intimidating guy  They always have the big guy  The big giant guy  Showing you around  You know  You walk in there  You gotta hold his hand 
[04:18:00]  He's like nine feet above you  Where are we headed  Thunder  Why do they give you a clipboard  For your first day  At the health club  You're walking around  With a clipboard  Can you feel like  More of a goofball  I'm new  I'm supposed to check things  As I see them  I'm standing out  Like a sore thumb  I'm sure you gotta follow  The you know  I always gotta follow 
[04:18:30]  The guy who can move  The entire rack of plates  The guy moves the entire rack  And then I gotta go up  And move two plates  Clank  Clank  Clank  I'm the two plate guy  Clank  Who wants to spot me  Clank  You know  You're walking out  You gotta reach way down  To get the pin  People know what you're doing  They see you got your hand  On the seat  And all they can see  Is your back 
[04:19:00]  And your knuckles  Are dragging against the floor  Trying to grab the pin  Out from the bottom  And then you gotta ask  Somebody for a footstool  To put it up  Where you need it  Can somebody  Give me a boost  I gotta put the pin  Up near the ceiling  Because the big guy  Had it a little lower  Than what I can handle  Oh my god  Bravo  People just feel like 
[04:19:30]  Asking you questions  I guess  That's odd  And from all over  All over the map  Yeah  Yeah  You're an expert  On everything  I think  That's what it is  Hey you know what  I want to show up  Brian  What's that  He was here  For the original  Sandy Cain appearance  Yes I was here  In the studio  One of the listeners  Touching her hemorrhoid  Over and over again  Right  You remember right Brian  Of course  You remember that  How does that  How does that go out  Of your memory banks  If you don't remember  Maybe I can play  A couple of sounds  That'll refresh  Your memory Brian  They're embedded 
[04:20:00]  In my memory soundtrack  But sure  Let's listen  She came in  She had her hemorrhoid  We had a listener  Come in  And apply preparation H  I know  To her  Yeah you saw  The whole thing  And if you remember  The first application  She was in mid-sentence  Mid-sentence  And she said this  I don't believe  I think she was saying  I don't believe  I'm doing this  And you could tell 
[04:20:30]  Right at the point  Of contact  Of preparation H  To hemorrhoid  When she said  I don't believe  I don't believe  A sound only  Somebody can only make  When somebody  Applies preparation H  By complete surprise  I don't believe  You know if you  Hired a voiceover person  To try to nail that  It would take them  A thousand takes  And they wouldn't  Be able to duplicate this  I don't believe  Now the second time  He applied it  Because it was so much  Fun the first time  We told him now  Really really apply it 
[04:21:00]  Hard  And she made this sound  Oh  Plain simple  Straight to the point  Oh  Oh  Oh man  Oh  Now by the third time  We're all laughing  We tell him  Maybe he can't cover  Enough area  With just one digit  So we told him  Take the middle finger  And the index  The pointer finger  And apply  Thoroughly  And to that  She just made this sound  Ow 
[04:21:30]  Ow  So you can see  The gradual  I don't believe  Oh  Ow  Progression of the  Application of preparation  So the question  I have for Brian  Is it safe to say  That was the grossest  Thing you've ever seen  Or close to it  That was definitely  A top tenner  Okay  She does comedy  And magic  Is that  The magic  Is the fact  That she's still breathing  Right  Comedy  Just trying to give her 
[04:22:00]  A little plug  We didn't think  There was anything  Grosser on her body  Yeah  She came back  Brian  And we want to show you  A picture of what  She showed us  Okay  This is  I'm turning it away  For a minute  This picture  You are about to see  Is a growth  That is on  Sandy Cain's  Thatch  Or patch  I think you know  The area in question  And she just  Pulled this out of nowhere  She goes  Yeah  I had this thing going on  And now I have this growth  So we took a picture of it 
[04:22:30]  And put it up on the website  Because everyone should  Share in the misery  And we want you to  Oh god  I just looked at it  Well let's see the reaction  We want you to take a look at this  And tell us what you think  I don't believe  And then above  You've got the ad  Lose weight fast  You see that  I don't know  It looks like  We said it looked like  The ear  I'm getting  No I was just 
[04:23:00]  Looking at it  Let me get it off  What  What  What area  It was right there  That's right there  Right above  And to the left  Of ground zero  Yeah  And  Man  It's like a half a year  Brian  It looks like  Did you see that little mouse  That they grew the human ear on  For transplanting  Yes  It looked like that  Except  With a more  Cauliflower texture  To it  Oh  Nice right  So how'd you like to get  Your first ear implant  And  And then they gotta go 
[04:23:30]  Um  You might want to sit down  We want to  Tell you a little bit  About the origins  Of this  Where this came from  You know there's certain areas  Where it's easier  To grow an ear  Did you know  Take a look at this  Andrea  Hey Ope  And everyone  What's up  Hello  I got bifocals  You did  Yes  And I wanted to know  If he's ever had any  Experience with bifocals  Well you know  They actually have 
[04:24:00]  Trifocals now  Really  My eye doctor  I swear  He asked me  If I wanted to try  Trifocals  And I was like  I must have been away a while  And I said  I don't know  What you're talking about  He goes  Well it's what you would think  You know  You could see it  Three different distances  Depending on where you look  Through the lens  You can see close  Or medium  Or far away  And I'm like  You know  I can't even imagine  Getting used to that  You know  There's a book  There's a plane  There's Alpha Centauri  Do people need  This kind of range  You know  Is that a fly in my nose 
[04:24:30]  Is that a comet  Hey  Do you need to see  Everything  I believe that's an amoeba  Andromeda strain  I don't know if  Andromeda strain  Is a galaxy  But it sure sounds like one  It sure does  He's kind of  Winging the last one  Or if somebody  Doesn't call in  Wait a second  There's no such  Interplanetary  Place called 
[04:25:00]  Andromeda strain  What kind of joke  Is that clown  If you're gonna be  Talking about galaxies  Nail them down  Ho ho  Andromeda strain  I'm sitting here  All disappointed  In your humor  Because I like  Small things  And big things  Paramecium  Yeah that's right  Andromeda strain  Do some research  Clown  Hey John  What's up  Hey I just wanted  To ask Brian  What happened to him

[04:28:00]  With the Opie and Anthony show  Hi  In studio  Christopher Titus  Hello  If you're a circus freak  Call in  We'll help you through it  Yeah  For our counseling sessions  That we're having now  Hey the 97 year old guy  Didn't sing  Angelica  When he was doing that  Did he  We gave her the rape hotline  And the geriatric  Rape hotline  Yeah right  I blame Viagra  Right  You pop three at one time 
[04:28:30]  My friend  You're going after anybody  You get a 97 year old guy  That does Viagra  All of a sudden  His junk starts working  What do you think  What do you think  He's going to look at a 97 year old woman  And go  Let's get it on  Exactly  First of all  There ain't no woman Viagra  So that thing is just like a desert  Right so he figured  That this 12 or 13 year old girl  Will be the one  Well he shouldn't have gone  All the way to the other end  Of the spectrum  You know  Get a nice spring chicken  Of 55 or something  A lot of people don't know  What they do  When they wake up  After the Viagra  They're not sure  Right maybe all the blood  Rushed out of his head  And he just went wild 
[04:29:00]  Now before  I tell you a story  Before they had Viagra  I'm hanging out with my dad  At the Oakland Rosa show  I'm walking around  He's married to this new woman  And we're walking around  And he's going  He had to shoot a needle  Into his  Wait wait wait  I'm telling you  Hold on hold on  We're just cleaning up  Because they dumped out of that  I don't know why  Believe me  It makes no sense  We understand  It makes no sense  You should be able to say that  Because it's a medical thing  And that's what he had to do  Put the needle into his  He did  But you can't say the P word  For the guy's thing  You could say it  We say mule  We say yam bag 
[04:29:30]  We say junk  You got it  So here's the thing  My dad's junk  Is not working as well  As it should  Because he had a couple  Of heart attacks  Four  Actually they actually  Your dad had four  Yeah they actually  Revoked his organ donor card  So he's talking to me  What's he talking  He's father son talk  Which is freak me out  I'm walking around  The Oakland Rosa  And he goes  He's going yeah  So before the Viagra thing  I had this needle  And he had to shoot it  And he goes one day  He goes I figured  They give me  They say 10 cc's  You shoot in  And I figured  So my dad goes  Shoot it right  Right into the junk  Yeah into the junk  And he goes  I think 10 cc's  Close to what I'm doing  The doctor says 
[04:30:00]  Don't use any more  10 cc's  Well I'm thinking  I want to perform  For the new lady  Can I slow you down  A little bit  Yeah  Because I don't get it  So before Viagra  But what do you  Oh before Viagra  So my dad got married  Yes my dad got married  To this woman right  And he wanted to make sure  She was  But what does this stuff do  It does what Viagra does  Yeah  No actually  I think it took  It probably takes  The place of  The blood that would  Normally go there  To put it in the state  No it was a chemical  It was something  Because it  Whatever it constricted  Everything  So it would  Really  So his junk would expand 
[04:30:30]  Hey is that good  I did this  Yeah that's good  That's good  Alright go ahead  I'm just getting  Putting a needle  So walking around  The road to show  My dad's talking to me  He goes yeah  Just like tossing it off  He goes so  I'm going to use it right  And he goes  I figured 10 cc's  They said 10 cc's  Is my normal  I'll do 30 cc's  So my dad's junk turned  He goes  He goes  He goes  My junk turned black  And he goes  And it took 11 hours  11 hours to go down  And I'm literally  Like just bowed over laughing 
[04:31:00]  That's funny  I couldn't imagine  Having to put a needle  No  No  I'm getting that feeling  Don't you get that feeling  Down there  When someone even talks about it  Yeah  It's like ah  Exactly  I can't imagine  Any woman  Look across from him  Going you know  You are so sexy  Give me my syringe  Yeah  See how important it is  Let's do it  See how important sex is  To guys  If you're willing  To take a needle  And jam it into your junk  Yeah  It's a pretty important thing  Exactly  There's no perspective 
[04:31:30]  For all the ladies out there  Hey what happened to Happy Face  He was calling back  At the commercials  And no Happy Face  Dice down at  Ground Zero  We're a little distracted  Christopher Titus  Because Dice called  All emotional  He wasn't ready to  He wasn't in the right  State of mind to be on our show  And we wanted to  Oh it was at Ground Zero  Then we found out  He was going down to Ground Zero  We want to see how that went for him  I'm just imagining  The guys that are down there  Now working  Are probably like  Alright you know  De Niro was here  A few months ago  And we just really want to  Pave this road  And get this done  Exactly  You know
