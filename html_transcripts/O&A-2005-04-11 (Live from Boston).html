<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from Bill's Bar in Boston on Red Sox opening day was a chaotic, sexually explicit, and highly unconventional affair.  The show, originating from a bar near Fenway Park, featured a constant stream of listener calls, in-studio guests, and significant audience participation, often unruly and disruptive.  Technical difficulties with microphones and feedback were frequent.

The broadcast opened with angry calls from Red Sox fans, followed by a discussion about a missing Yankee ticket allegedly possessed and given away by Ben Affleck, sparking a heated exchange.  This was followed by a series of listener-reported "assaults on the media," where listeners detailed their attempts (some successful, some not) to disrupt local news broadcasts with Opie and Anthony-related signage, featuring individuals like Frank from Jersey and Buffalo Paul.  The hosts then discussed the show's recent move off the premium XM channel and the resulting content changes and potential for future censorship.

The in-studio guests included actor Spaulding (from *Caddyshack*), who discussed his experience filming the movie, his relationship with Rodney Dangerfield, and his post-acting career in real estate.  Ben Affleck made a brief appearance, followed by Jimmy Norton (who flew in from LA), and the band Godsmack (Tony, Robbie, and Shannon).  Bill "Spaceman" Lee made a surprise appearance, engaging in discussions about his baseball career and unsubstantiated rumors of drug use involving himself and George W. Bush.

A significant portion of the show involved interactions with several wheelchair-bound listeners, most notably Wheelchair Fred, who attempted (and briefly succeeded) to stand unassisted.  Fred's appearances were intertwined with discussions of his sexual experiences and his demands for a limo, hotel room, appearance money, and a prostitute.  The hosts repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, attempted to encourage female audience members to display nudity.

Opie’s confession of living three years without a dresser, storing his clothes in piles on the floor, generated considerable amusement.  The show featured a contest to win XM radios with increasingly outrageous challenges for participants.  A webcam feed was mentioned, though the image was obscured.  The hosts engaged in crude humor, made numerous offensive remarks targeting various groups and individuals, and gossiped about Boston celebrities, including Tom Brady.  Producer Eric was present and active, while Martini Steve was absent due to marital problems.  A Boston Herald item mentioning the broadcast and a gossip column about Opie meeting a comedy club owner were also discussed.

Godsmack's performance and Q&A included discussions of their live shows, a bizarre Billy Crystal photo incident, and a challenge for a large audience member (Kenny) to skip across the venue.  The band’s segment was punctuated by a chaotic and highly sexually suggestive live audience interaction, including numerous instances of audience members flashing, lap dances for Fred, and chants of "Show your dick!"  Detailed descriptions of encounters with celebrities (including negative experiences with Alyssa Milano and positive ones with Cindy Crawford) and a masturbation incident involving a camera were shared.  The hosts made increasingly absurd food orders for a staff member (Ricky), culminating in a graphic description of a desired cinnamon roll texture.  A kiss between a Red Sox and a Yankees fan was orchestrated (supposedly) to unite the two teams. The show culminated in a “What Did We Learn” segment resulting in more crude humor and suggestive comments.

A lengthy negotiation with two women in the audience resulted in one woman flashing her breasts for Godsmack and a promise of a sexual encounter involving Jimmy Norton, her boyfriend, a MiFi device, and video recording for the show. A discussion about Godsmack's experiences touring with Metallica followed.  The show concluded with a lengthy bit featuring comedian Brian Regan, who recounted humorous anecdotes from his Little League baseball experience,  ending abruptly with chaotic goodbyes and unintelligible chatter.  A mention was made of a large, angry black man providing security at the studio entrance, threatening violence against anyone causing trouble.  The hosts also mentioned an upcoming MiFi sex-on-camera promotion they might watch in Atlantic City, and their return to their renovated New York studio after a two-week break.

[00:05:30]  TO YOU  WE'LL TALK TO WHEELCHAIR  FRED A LITTLE LATER  WE MET WHEELCHAIR  FRED LIKE  SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO  AND YOU'VE HAD A ROUGH  SEVEN EIGHT YEARS  BROUGH  Oh, look at Fred.  There he is.  Wow.  He's just sitting down there.  I heard he had a lot of demands, Opie.  Yeah, he wanted a...  A lot of demands wheelchair Fred is making.  He wanted a limo, a hotel room, appearance money, a hooker.  A couple of legs that worked.  A bag of... 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no limo.  No limo?  Just a girl.  Just a girl?  Just wants a girl.  Well, you're not going to find a girl in this place today.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Yet another O&A sausage fest.  Right.  Jesus Christ.  You know, when we get back to New York, we're really going to have to start being nice to  the ladies so they start showing up again.  Yeah, Jim.  Stop trying to fuck all of them.  You know...  Ah, they're cheering on sexual assault or something. 
[00:06:30]  So, wheelchair Fred, how did you get here?  That guy?  That's right.  Who's that guy?  Hi, mate.  Some weirdo named Mike.  Some weirdo named Mike?  Yeah, you got it.  Mike, do you know wheelchair Fred?  Only through email and the old cell phone.  Only through email and the cell phone.  You didn't have to do Fred or anything, did you?  No.  Yeah, you know...  Unconditional.  You've heard that story, of course. 
[00:07:00]  He's so desperate.  Poor Fred is so desperate for sexual activity that he has opened up his options to both male  and female.  Just have the contact.  So, one day he was hanging out in some convenience store near his house and he found some guy  that was going to do him.  And he had sex with a man, but he's not gay, he's just desperate.  That's why I brought my friends with me, just to make sure there's no hijinks.  What's he going to do?  He's in a wheelchair.  Yeah, it's true.  If you get raped by a guy in a wheelchair, you are asking for it. 
[00:07:30]  Don't get me.  Yeah.  And then he wheeled one of the wheels up my butt crack.  It was awful.  You'd be surprised.  I'm quite strong.  I'm fine.  You're quite strong.  Yeah, but you've got to catch him one U-turn and you're done.  I could double back on you and laugh.  Or just grab the handles on the back of the chair and wheel you.  What are you going to do? 
[00:08:00]  That's true.  Stop so I can kick your ass.  Are we going to try to get Wheelchair Fred to stand today again?  No, no, that didn't go well last time.  So, no, we shan't be trying to get Wheelchair Fred to stand.  Oh, there he's standing.  No, you don't stand anymore, right?  I do all the time.  Really?  Uh-oh, he's challenging us.  No, I don't mind.  This went horribly wrong last time.  Old turnip legs.  Oh, I'll show you right now. 
[00:08:30]  All right, Fred.  Wheelchair Fred is going to show us that he could actually stand.  You know, I love this.  You know, the miracle that was the Red Sox winning the World Series.  And now we are going to witness yet another miracle.  It's not going to work out the same way, though.  All right.  All right, he's locking his wheels.  Lock them up.  All right.  He's, I don't know what he's doing.  He's standing.  Oh, oh.  He's kind of up.  No hands.  No, don't grab anything. 
[00:09:00]  He's trying to grab a microphone.  Especially not something loose like a microphone.  Hey, Fred, can you stand with no hands?  Whoa.  All right.  Get a job, you motherfucker.  Quit faking.  I just got no balance.  You got no balance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I'm up on my ass.  Yeah.  Talk to all these people after a couple hours.  They won't have any balance either.  You bunch of drunks. 
[00:09:30]  Who's drinking this early?  You know, dude, I expected a couple of people to hold up their cups.  Everybody's drinking.  Bunch of lushes.  I love it.  Boston baby, of course.  Red Sox and alcoholics.  Hold on.  Let's do that again for the website.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Who's drinking?  He's taking pictures.  Nice.  You got it?  We got it.  I didn't see the flash.  I know.  It'll, whatever.  So, also, there's a bunch of people here that were doing assaults on the media for us. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I heard a lot of people were gone.  Well, get some of these guys up near the stage.  I want to talk to them.  Look at the big dopey cartoon head signs they were using in front of the media, Opie.  I heard they got Channel 4 or something.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Here they come.  Oh, donkey sausage right here, everybody.  Oh.  Hi, guys.  Donkey sausage.  So, tell us what was happening out there. 
[00:10:30]  I see a bunch of guys from Wack Bag.  Yeah.  They're now sporting their own T-shirts.  I see that.  The Wack Bag people now have their own WackBag.com T-shirts.  It was myself, Buster Hyman, Jim, and Bostonian Ben, Boston Strangler.  I love they all have nicknames.  Oh, they all got their names.  Ben was at the bar giving us a go signal.  Myself and Jim were standing behind a van by the Channel 7 News.  And Ben yells, deploy, deploy, deploy. 
[00:11:00]  So, we run out.  They had no idea we were standing back there.  I come out with a WOW sticker saying, O&A Party Rock.  He comes out with a stern mask on saying, hoo-hoo, O&A Party Rock.  Classic.  And the big-ass homemade WOW sign.  And they got part of it, but the guy did have ninja-like reflexes and panned up.  Yeah, they're pretty good like that.  Well, as long as you got part of it and it got on the audio. 
[00:11:30]  Apparently, I look like a man.  And so, I mean, but I always look like a man, so.  You look like a man?  Who said you look like a man?  The guys on the board.  So, they were complaining about it.  What?  They were complaining that you look like a man?  Yeah.  You know, the whack-bag guys have to calm down.  Some of the board people.  Here's a team of go-getters, Opie.  Everybody out there doing the assault on the media.  And the message board has to write about how you look like a man?  What the?  Unbelievable.  That's awful.  You ought to cock-whip all of them. 
[00:12:00]  And that might have been funny if I said cock-whip instead of cock-whip.  Fucking mush-mouthed.  Nice.  What are you, running through scripts in your head, Jim?  Ooh, very busy.  Anyone else notice?  There's a show here.  Anyone else notice that Jim grew his hair in?  How can they notice it's fucking dark enough in here to grow mushrooms?  Do you have a light on the back?  We also, uh...  Well, we do have a light.  You want to see how bad it is?  I would like to see it, yeah.  Yeah, turn on that spotlight.  Watch just for a second.  It's blinding. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, that really helps.  That's nice.  I'll take off my G-string.  You can put a dollar in my asshole.  How about a regular light?  That's a fucking whore red light.  Light diva.  Yeah, Ben was giving you shit backstage, calling you a diva.  Yeah, just because I wanted a pickup from the airport.  I came in yesterday.  I was worried that opening day today would be very crowded, you know, obviously at Fenway. 
[00:13:00]  So I wanted a pickup, and I didn't get one.  A pickup at the airport?  You wanted a car?  Yeah.  But you didn't get a car?  No.  From the airport?  No.  You had to make your own transportation?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  Exactly.  Unbelievable.  Fred, don't you find that so inconvenient?  What?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  I can go anywhere.  You can go anywhere.  I can't.  Oh, you can't go anywhere. 
[00:13:30]  I can't do diddly shit.  I can't do diddly shit.  Oh, you can't do diddly shit.  We heard that.  I'm my own.  You're the only person harder to understand in person than on the phone.  You're right.  He also wants money for being here today.  Yes, he is the man's.  Fuck him!  Oh, we got a nice fuck up from the back of the room.  You can do that too, sir. 
[00:14:00]  I can't want to say I'm not gay.  Right.  He's not gay.  Just desperate.  I'm desperate.  Desperate.  You had sex with another man.  Actually, a man had sex with you.  You were a bottom.  Yeah, right.  But you're not gay.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, and with that, Opie, I would like to welcome all the new listeners to the Anthony program. 
[00:14:30]  All the new listeners that were too cheap to pay for it for the first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just saying, Anthony.  Welcome to all the Jews.  Yeah, we're off the premium channel.  Yes.  And we gave him a very PC show while we were on break.  You notice that?  Yeah, well, now this is what I heard.  I called up to ask how the Pesto was doing.  Well, actually, I went to Wackbag, where I get all of my show information. 
[00:15:00]  I don't even call our producer or anything.  I go to Wackbag, I read their little picky, bitchy posts about what is wrong with the show.  And I read a whole bunch saying, what the fuck?  We got like the same show 38 times in a row.  And so I wrote an email to Ben and Eric and asked, what happened with the best of?  Why were we playing so many of the same ones in a row?  And they said, well, there was kind of a problem with the content.  We slipped some stuff in at last minute and they didn't like it. 
[00:15:30]  And I'm like, well, is this going to be like a problem with censorship now on our show because we're off the premium?  And they assured us no.  It was just that the first taste they wanted to give of the people that hadn't been paying,  if they're just driving in their minivan with their soccer moms and stuff and just tune in,  they didn't want to hear maybe Pat O'Brien saying, fuck me, you know, I want to fuck you.  Or the wheelchair Fred dildo.  Right, the dildo, him laying in a bathtub with a dildo. 
[00:16:00]  So as a matter of fact, I'm on the show and I didn't want to hear that one.  So I kind of agree with that.  But now are we all set?  There's not going to be any problems with content?  That's what they're telling us, so we'll see.  They have to edit the first 20 minutes of this program if there is.  No more what?  What's that?  No more Tony Danza.  Yeah, they re-ran the Tony Danza show about ten times.  Hey, let's give a big hand to the Tony Danza show, all right? 
[00:16:30]  Thoughts and prayers to you too, sir.  Thoughts and prayers to those best ofs.  You'll never fucking hear them again, all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Where's Frank from Jersey?  Right here.  Frank from Jersey also did an assault on the media, Anthony.  We love this assault on the media.  Nice.  Getting our names out there because, well, XM has been lacking in the marketing department.  Even though we're not going to bitch as much as we used to now that we're off premium, right?  Hope you enjoyed the assault on the media.  Love, Frank from Whackbag. 
[00:17:00]  No, no, no.  I'm Frank from New Jersey.  I call the show all the time.  I'm the prick that you always hang up on.  You hate me.  We hate you.  You hate me.  Oh, Frank from Jersey, of course.  That fucking prick.  I know you.  We don't like you.  Norton goes politically correct.  Fuck you.  You know, I'm the guy who always calls in the buster chomps, but I love you.  I'm only pushing.  But I'm that fucking guy.  Fuck you.  Fuck me.  Wait, which guy?  Which guy?  I don't know which guy.  What I did.  Frank from Jersey.  Yeah, yeah.  And unfortunately, we haven't figured out how to hang up on live people yet. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Yes, we do.  It's called Club Soda Kenny.  It's called One Clothesline.  All right, go ahead, Frank.  No, but guys, this is what I did.  All right, what did you do?  Fox 29 was doing a live feed.  I ran up in front of him.  It's Fox 25, by the way, up here in Boston.  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Wait, let Heinrich Himmler hair finish. 
[00:18:00]  There you go!  There you go!  That's it!  I didn't think I'd get that one out.  Oh, ooh.  You got it, though.  Very nice.  No, no.  I tagged the motherfucker.  I went up against the news guy while I was doing a live feed.  I put the wow sticker on his arm.  I walked by.  That motherfucker had it on his arm the whole feed.  So he had it on his arm.  You wow sticker to a newsman?  And he had it on there the whole time he was broadcasting?  The sticker was on his arm while I was doing his feed.  I walked right by.  I tagged him. 
[00:18:30]  Does anyone care in this room what Frank just said?  Well, I don't think they heard it in the back.  Tell them what you did because that's actually...  Shut up.  I thought it was cool.  No, I didn't.  Stop it.  We heard it.  Go ahead, Frank.  Wait, wait.  We can't hear you.  Oh.  Go ahead.  This is something I learned from...  I didn't say anything.  Oh.  All right, Frank.  Go ahead.  We're ready for you now.  I checked into a hotel room.  I spent about six hours. 
[00:19:00]  Did my business.  Went to the front desk.  Jesus Christ, I saw a roach.  Half Christ.  What?  What?  All right, let's hear it for Frank from Jersey.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Also, once...  Shut up.  Shut up.  Where's Buffalo Paul?  Oh, there he is. 
[00:19:30]  I recognize this guy from the promotional tour.  You drove all the way from Buffalo?  From Buffalo, yeah.  Wow.  A bunch of you guys?  Well, we had two of us came up from Buffalo, yeah.  Cool.  Oh, that was a fun interview.  It was a wild trip.  Huh?  It was a pretty wild trip.  Better than the Jersey guy.  We did a good assault on the media, too.  This was quick.  On channel 29, was it Fox, or 25?  Wait, you assaulted the media as well?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  Okay.  What'd you do?  We held the big sign up right behind when he was doing it.  As a matter of fact, I got the sign right up behind the guy's head, and he's like, well, 
[00:20:00]  these people are standing in line for baseball, and then the guy's going to accept this guy  behind me.  He grabbed the sign.  He's choking real bad, Jimmy.  He's just panicking.  He's terrible on the media.  He's panicking.  He's panicking.  He's got the cotton mouth and the ball stuck in his throat.  I'm a guy from Fox 29.  Now he's admitting how awful he is on the radio.  All I've learned from the past two people that have talked on that mic is that Fox 25 has  to do a better job of telling people what fucking channel they're on.  Fox 29.  Fox 86. 
[00:20:30]  So I said, yeah, he held up a wow sticker with his father.  Yeah.  Tell the story again.  Who cares if the people are listening?  Shut up.  Just tell it.  Relax.  I want to.  No.  All right.  Yeah.  Give him another shot.  Why not?  Go ahead, Paul.  Calm down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Hold on.  Hold on what?  We held the sign up behind the guy's head.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  We've been testifying in front of Congress.  Ralph Cramden did a smoother infomercial. 
[00:21:00]  All right, Paul, take a deep breath.  Let's go.  This is very important for the show.  Wow, you're sweating and everything.  He's sweating.  No, like I said, we stuck a lot of stickers out.  We stuck a lot.  Holy Peter Brady.  And it's time to stick a sticker.  All right.  Go ahead, Paul.  No, like I said, we.  You stickered the town a little bit.  We stick a lot.  We got a lot of things.  A lot of things.  Are you watching that show?  He's totally joking. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  So there was something with a sticker.  What happened?  What?  Yeah.  There was a sticker.  It was Fox 29, and they were there, and you held the sign up behind the guy's head.  All right.  Go ahead.  What did the guy say when you did it?  Well, he said he was interviewing the people, and he said, everybody's here standing in line.  And then I had a big sign behind the guy, and he goes, except for this guy here, and he pulls the sign down.  That was it.  Well, no, that's not a bad story. 
[00:22:00]  I know.  If we can get 13 episodes around that.  All right.  Let's hear it for Buffalo Paul.  Huge time on the show, actually.  Drove a long way to come here.  What an ovation.  That's not a bad.  That's a nice o...  That's nice.  That's fantastic.  Where's Spaulding?  Yeah.  Where is Spaulding?  Well, I've been in Boston for the last two or three days, and this is supposed to be a star-studded show, according to Ben.  That's right.  An extravaganza. 
[00:22:30]  Ben was telling me about all the...  Look, he...  Wait.  Where are you going?  So far, the only celebrity appearance is Nicholson's hair from The Shining.  It's on Ben's head.  He's a rock star, man.  Well, Ben was telling us that there's going to be a lot of celebrities here today.  Yeah.  I was hearing names like a lot of Red Sox players.  Oh, we heard Johnny Damon.  Yeah.  At one point, we heard that Johnny Damon was going to come by and say hi.  He was going to stop by and say hi.  Who else? 
[00:23:00]  Lenny Clark and Dennis Leary.  Yes.  A couple of the Patriots.  A couple of the Patriots.  Tom Brady.  Tom Brady.  Who doesn't want anyone to know that he listens to XM Satellite Radio.  That was a cool story.  We were talking to Ben last night.  He was like, dude, Tom Brady said that, like, you know, don't tell anyone, but I got XM in my car.  Like, you know.  Because that's who Tom Brady would confide in.  You know, some guy doing fucking blow off an XM Wow sticker.  Yeah, I got the phone call from Ben last night and was talking about, you know, and I just heard this cavalcade of celebrities coming out of the phone. 
[00:23:30]  So, I don't know.  I guess they'll show up a little later.  Yeah, I'm sure they will.  I think we, is Godsmack confirmed?  All right, we're going to have Godsmack here and Spaulding from Caddyshack.  Yes.  Spaulding.  What time is Spaulding showing up, Ben?  10.30.  So, when he's late.  All right, well, we'll see.  I think he'll come.  He ain't a better friend.  He's playing golf today.  All right.  And, all right. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  So, Wheelchair Fred, once again.  Yes.  No, give me, give me the box.  I need body, I need.  You need what?  I need your body, baby.  Oh, oh.  He wants money and her body.  He wants donkey sausage.  This is the Wheelchair Fred box farm.  I'm going to go.  Wow, you make that yourself?  Wait, you're actually throwing dollars in?  Yes.  All right.  I got right now $100, and you are not getting it.  That's for later.  That's right. 
[00:24:30]  That's going to be used for a chance, trans...  I fucking suck.  Wow.  Are you okay today?  I'm tired, man.  Fuck.  I didn't get a vacation.  What's that?  I'll take your hundred.  Will you take my hundred?  I'll take your hundred.  Will you be willing to earn my hundred?  Can I wow stick to the back of your head?  All right.  All right.  There's a crispy five.  We'll start...  Whole, Fred.  I had a bad time at the casino tables on the ship, Fred, so I'll start with a 20, and we'll 
[00:25:00]  see where it goes from there.  There you go.  Thank you, sir.  The Wheelchair Fred fun.  And, you know, the fun and excitement of watching him get rolls for that box at the  end of this.  Just a crumpled man and a little puddle of garbage juice by the curb.  That box torn open and empty.  Well, we're just warming up.  Why don't we see if these phones are going to work live for Boston, okay?  Ooh!  A bunch of people want to say hi.  Here we go.  Let's try Josh in Philly.  Josh, what's up? 
[00:25:30]  Yo, guys.  How you doing?  I wanted to look at you guys back for your vacation.  Morning, Pete.  Hi, Josh.  Hi, Josh.  Thanks for calling the program.  Not you.  I want to find out when's Mayor Menino going to die in a car crash.  What's that?  Mayor Menino.  I want to find out when Mayor Menino's going to die in a car crash.  Oh, you didn't hear?  Mayor Menino was walking by Bill's bar, actually.  Was he?  Yeah, he's doing something before the game today.  I heard Ben says he's going to stop in and talk on the show for a little while.  Yeah, I'm sure he will. 
[00:26:00]  All right, Josh.  Thanks, Josh.  Thanks, Josh.  Hey, Menino.  Doubt, doubt.  Let's go to Doug Out, Doug from Wackbag.  Doug, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, and welcome back to the radio.  I want to give a big thank you to that ass clown from the 80s channel.  I didn't know it was possible to take six months of great radio and turn it into wacky, quirky, zany morning food stuff.  Oh, you didn't like Bruce's production?  Bruce Kelly helped us out when we were on break.  I fucking hated Bruce's stuff. 
[00:26:30]  Complete with fake fart noises and wacky scene music.  Are you kidding?  Stringing together some good radio and making you guys sound like a bunch of faggots.  Dude, make sure we have that stuff, and when we get back, we want to play that.  When we get back to New York, we'll play some of that stuff.  Did he have, like, weird, uh, he had fart noises?  What, like, wacky whistles and stuff?  It was, uh, it was morning zoo-ish.  It was morning zoo-ish.  He has the charisma of an air-conditioning hum. 
[00:27:00]  He did everything but your horn, your wacky, zany horn.  The wacky horn.  The wacky horn.  Oh, yeah.  All right, I'll look forward to hearing that when we get back.  Welcome back, guys.  Good to have you back live.  Thank you.  And, uh, what up to Boston Strangler?  I hope you don't die today.  Have a good day.  All right, thank you.  There he goes.  Doug from wackbag.com.  We'll do another one here.  Uh, let's say hi to Joe in Brooklyn.  Joe, what's up?  Brooklyn.  Brooklyn in the house.  Joe.  How you doing, guys?  Very good, man.  Really, man? 
[00:27:30]  Especially after those bullshit replays that we're doing.  Yeah, we heard.  But anyway, the reason I told, I want to know if, uh, Anthony and Sweet since the Wearing  Day Yankee caps are in the bag and cut me off.  I am being the coward that I always am.  Yeah.  And I'm just remaining neutral and rooting internally.  I'm not going to get the shippied out of me in the streets here behind the fucking Fenway  Park.  I'm not an idiot.  There is, I don't even think.  Go Sox.  Yeah.  Go David Ortiz.  I don't think there's one Yankee logo in this whole place.  No. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, are there a couple?  Yeah, there's a couple.  Yankee, stop!  Oh.  Yankee, stop!  There it is.  Yankee, stop!  Yankee, stop!  I forgot we're here for the game.  Yeah, Yankee logo.  You have a better shot at seeing Tiger Woods and his bride getting a round of applause in  this town.  Oh, boy.  And his bride.  How old am I?  Fucking 60?  Big bride.  And his best gal.  All right.  We're just warming up.  Why don't we take a break and get some beers in us, you know? 
[00:28:30]  All right.  We're up here for the, of course, opening day.  It's the Sox, baby.  And the Yankees.  And the Yankees.  And we're at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street, pretty much right behind the Green Monster,  with a bunch of our friends, a bunch of our freaks.  They're drinking.  And we'll continue with the Opiate Anthony program in just a bit.  And, um...  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[00:29:00]  How can I honestly say?  Anybody rips me off.  When I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then...  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right.  Well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I mean...  I know you...  I know I...  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all. 
[00:29:30]  What about going off on...  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars.  Jumping, grabbing. 
[00:30:00]  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn like, beep, beep.  Dude.  Oh, dude.  He's so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow.  Even the stuff that's going to be invented, I...  I did already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it. 
[00:30:30]  Everyone just killed themselves.  I've done it all.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the...  What was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Hoo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday. 
[00:31:00]  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw...  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Yeah, girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents.  A bandana around an antenna that reminds me of something else I've heard. 
[00:31:30]  It's called the fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on.  Hoo-hoo, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented a bandana with me.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  I'm from Boston.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's showtime, folks.  Turn it on and watch it show.  You're going to be made fun of.  All right.  Man, those guys are really cards. 
[00:32:00]  Why don't you shove it out your ass?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from Boston at Bill's Bar.  I think the beer is starting to kick in, Anthony.  Opening day.  Red Sox, Yankees.  Boston.  It doesn't take long.  This guy's drinking, drinking, smoking. 
[00:32:30]  I might have to get a Bloody Mary or something.  Start slow.  Start slow?  Well, I was used to being on the cruise ship, Opie.  Used to waking up, a little Bloody Mary action.  And then you get out on the deck, a nice big banana daiquiri.  Nice.  And then you start later on in the day, you do the banana daiquiri until you hit the casino.  And then that's when you do your past.  I can't believe you're admitting that you drank a banana daiquiri in front of these animals. 
[00:33:00]  You're on a cruise, though.  They're giving you the fag sign in the back of the room.  Let me tell you some of that.  What's the hardest part about drinking a banana daiquiri?  Is it keeping the balls off your eyes?  I might agree with you if, you know, I was hanging out here at Bill's Bar and ordered one.  When you're on a Caribbean cruise, what the hell else are you going to drink?  You know, you drink the local drinks.  The banana daiquiri.  I didn't hear.  Oh, yes, yes, sir. 
[00:33:30]  We do have an audience microphone.  If someone has something to say, we'll go with it.  I believe he's commenting on my attire.  Did I get this at Saks Fifth Avenue?  Excuse me, Anthony.  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  Anthony, there's no Bloody Mary mix.  Would you like something else?  Oh, maybe a mimosa.  No, I won't. 
[00:34:00]  I'll wait, then.  I'll have a beer later on.  All right.  Hey, by the way, Club Soda Kenny, you want to try out your new joke in front of this Boston crowd?  Uh-oh.  Club Soda Kenny has a brand new joke.  Ooh.  He told it at dinner last night when we were dining with Muhammad Ali.  We forgot to...  What?  Wait till you hear this one after Kenny does his joke.  What?  Listen, before I left town, I asked my wife to get her belly button pierced.  This way I would have some place to hang an air freshener. 
[00:34:30]  That's not bad.  It actually isn't as bad as I anticipated.  Club Soda Kenny's new joke.  He only comes up with a new one every three months,  so that was a very special moment right there.  Apparently, Opie, a lot of echo on the phones is what the instant feedback is saying.  I like that.  I go to the instant feedback.  We've been off the air for about two weeks.  I go to maybe see what everybody's talking about,  and it's 2,000 posts of the phones sound like shit.  They're echoing. 
[00:35:00]  Nice.  Thank you.  Well, we're on location, though.  I mean, they spent like a million dollars to fix the studios in New York.  We'll see.  We'll test drive that on Wednesday when we're back in New York.  Oh, that's going to be fun, getting back into the studios.  Yeah, so we go to this steak joint last night on Boylston,  and all of a sudden we're just sitting there hanging out eating steak,  and Ben calls me, said he ran into Nomar Garciaparra's cousin or nephew or something.  Where's Ben?  Come out here, Ben.  You need a microphone.  He's on his little phone back there.  Is he?  That tiny little phone that he has? 
[00:35:30]  I don't want to hear that the scale was off.  You didn't give me the weight I paid for.  Eight balls not enough.  I need a nine ball.  No, no, I have witnesses.  You have witnesses on this one?  Supposedly, Muhammad Ali was at Abe and Louie's.  Yeah, but how did you find out?  That's the best part.  Nomar's cousin.  Nomar's cousin just happened to run into Ben.  Yeah, I know Nomar's cousin.  Ben's always running into celebrities in Boston.  No, he's always running into people who know celebrities.  It's always some bizarre connection.  The guy that molested Garciaparra's kid.  He was at BuzzFeed.  The best was, though.  I just saw Muhammad Ali. 
[00:36:00]  Eric comes up to me last night.  He goes, look, I got Muhammad Ali's autograph.  I went upstairs.  I opened the office upstairs.  It doesn't look anything like the...  We know.  Yeah.  We were eating in that place, and he said that Ali was in the restaurant.  We were there.  He's like, no, he's not.  We would have had a better chance of seeing Muhammad Atta in that episode.  Hey, how did you get Muhammad Ali's autograph but not see Muhammad Ali?  Like, that's what I'm not understanding.  The waiter brought it over for Jimmy.  Jimmy was talking about it.  The waiter brought it over.  We knew it was a joke, though.  We were talking about Ali.  Yeah, because we asked the waiter, is Muhammad Ali in this joint? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  And then he brings another waiter over, and the waiter starts laughing, and then he comes  back with this autograph.  Oh, okay.  So, obviously.  And the autograph was too perfect to be Muhammad Ali's, obviously.  And he spelled it A-L-E-E.  Oh, okay.  So, that was our night.  And you saved it?  Yeah, we have it back.  Great.  I'm sure it'll end up on eBay, and the money will go to Fred or some other dreck that we  have latched onto this program.  Do we actually have women in this place, by the way? 
[00:37:00]  One.  One.  One.  One.  Oh, and for my drink order, let me raise my hand.  Oh, yeah.  Getting back to the banana daiquiri story.  Oh, my vagina.  You know, itching a little bit.  No, I had no story.  I'm just saying that's what I did.  So, I ordered a Bloody Mary, but they don't have Bloody Mary.  Oh, I thought, like, the drinks got cooler, though.  Well, like Captain and Coke.  You know, stuff like that.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Girl.  Oh.  Hi.  Hi.  What's your name, girl? 
[00:37:30]  Sarah.  Mm-hmm.  And I guess you're a Red Sox fan, aren't you?  Kind of have to be.  Whoa.  You have to be.  We have so many mics set up in this joint.  That's what's going on here.  Yeah, it's feeding back.  It's all right.  It's all good.  Oh, it's get away from the speaker, right?  Yes.  All right.  Do anyone that you want in?  Yeah, do that.  There you go.  No, no.  No, no.  You just got to.  All right.  Go over there, really.  Just get in front of the speaker.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right here you go.  But now come back this way.  Back up this way.  Over.  No, not at you.  Walk far back. 
[00:38:00]  Hi.  What do you do?  Aren't you supposed to be at work?  No.  Aren't a lot of these people supposed to be?  What is it?  A frigging holiday around here?  Yeah, that's a good point.  Yeah, they should be working.  You don't understand Fred not being at work.  And what are you supposed to be doing right now?  This.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't understand.  What do you do?  I wait tables.  Oh, where?  Uh, shenanigans in Southie. 
[00:38:30]  Shenanigans.  Shenanigans?  Shenanigans.  If someone says shenanigans one more time, you ever see Super Troopers?  No.  Hysterical fucking movie.  All right.  Do you have to wear flair at shenanigans?  No.  No?  No.  Sounds like the kind of place where you'd need flair.  No.  I'm one of the only Americans that works there, though.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What are the rest?  A bunch of what?  Mix.  Patties.  Patties?  Yeah.  God damn, I love Boston. 
[00:39:00]  Boston is the most...  Yeah, a bunch of mix.  Yeah, you guys up here, it's like your own little world of racism and corruption.  I love it.  I love it.  How many people do you know or are directly related to that have made money on the Big Dig?  Eh.  Don't worry about it.  Everybody.  How many people you know?  How many relatives of yours are working the toll plazas?  The state is amazing.  We drove through the Big Dig.  It was nice.  No tiles fell on us or anything.  No?  No.  It was good.  Did you need a motorboat to get through some of the tunnels? 
[00:39:30]  I like the leaky tunnels you got.  Yeah, that's great.  We know how to build them in New York.  All right.  Yeah, look at that.  More girls.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  What's going on?  How old are you?  22.  Ooh, if I'd have met you 10 years ago.  Yeah.  22.  And how old are you?  22.  You're 22 also.  Yep.  Wow.  And what do you girls do?  I go to college.  Yes, you do.  And you're a Yankee fan. 
[00:40:00]  I am.  I'm from New York.  Oh, you're from New York?  Stop it.  And do you go to college also?  Didn't you guys used to do a show in New York?  Uh, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Because we used to listen to you back then, too.  Wow.  And you got kicked off for some naked contest thing.  Wow.  It was sex.  You sexted a church?  Yes.  Was it?  Yes.  Okay.  I remember that, too. 
[00:40:30]  It could have been, sure.  Yeah.  Not that Boston's had any problem with that at all.  You know, Cardinal Law.  Cardinal Law.  Yeah.  That's great.  I'd like to welcome Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie here to our show.  That's wonderful.  You're a student also, then?  I'm a nurse.  You're a nurse?  Wow.  Clean out the bedpans and stuff?  What?  You can clean out bedpans, things like that?  That's not my job.  Oh.  I fix people.  Do you have to put in catheters? 
[00:41:00]  You've got to grab the schlong.  Have guys ever gotten hard on you while they're, uh...  Because you're, you know, for a nurse...  It happens.  Are you...  You're a nurse in New York?  No, up here.  Oh, up here.  I was going to say, in New York, there's only, like, 300-pound black women.  Those are your nurses in New York.  I had one of those, though.  Wow.  300-pound black women.  You're like a nurse up here.  I would imagine you've got to have something done, and she's got to shave...  It's time to shave your balls.  Are you ready?  And, like, she comes up, and, you know, she puts the cream all over.  Yeah, starts, you know... 
[00:41:30]  Even though she's not shaving this part, she's...  No?  You ever have to do that?  You ever have to do that?  No.  What do you do as a nurse?  What do I do?  Yeah.  Yeah, what's the worst thing you have to do as a nurse?  What do you do?  Smother the elderly?  Oh, you've got to wipe ass?  Wipe ass.  Easily.  Oh, that's pretty bad.  You see, it's ruined it.  You want to demonstrate on wheelchair Fred?  I'm sure there's a crusty mess back there.  I'm sure there's some type of male fluid back there that's been flaking off.  That's awful. 
[00:42:00]  Something horrible.  It's like an asparagus growing out of this crack.  Mushrooms.  We've got a radio to give away.  Oh!  Oh!  She should show us some of her nursing ability.  No, so that's what you have to do.  Wiping is pretty much...  That's the worst thing I've got to do.  That's the worst thing you have to do.  But for the most part, what is it?  Dolling out medication and stuff?  Checking machines?  Things like that?  Do you have a lot of guys trying to pick you up?  Yeah.  It happens?  It's kind of hard picking up a girl while you're in the hospital, though.  Well, especially when she knows what's wrong with you?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Come on.  It's only the hiv.  Yep.  All right.  Well, we do have my fives to give away.  We've got to get creative with the my fives, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, Boston has always been a great spot for us to give away things because you people have  no scruples or you drink too much to actually have a reasonable thought, and you'll do just  about anything.  I admire that.  So we'll have some people come up and earn their my fives.  Very beautiful ladies, though.  I'm not used to seeing good-looking girls at our appearances.  That's good.  Obviously, they're mistaken, and they probably came into the wrong radio appearance. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, but you used to listen to New York, huh?  How old were you then?  16?  No, like 18, 19.  18, 19.  Teen!  Wow.  Teen listeners.  Teen listeners sound so much better than just listeners.  All right, why don't we go back to the phones?  Ladies, thank you.  Thank you, girls.  Try not to get sexually assaulted.  Guys, these ladies are looking for free beer today, so take care of them.  Oh, they're throwing shirts at them. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, wait, miss.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, let's go back to the phones and see what's going on, Anthony.  It's Isaac in L.A.  Isaac.  What's up, man?  What's up, Isaac?  Not much.  I'm a new type subscriber.  I just barely heard the show of the weekend, man.  I love it.  Oh.  Thank you.  You're already hooked?  You just started listening?  Yeah.  What bit got you hooked on the Opie and Anthony show?  Oh, well, I heard the worst of it, and then I just loved it. 
[00:44:00]  He heard the whole package there.  He heard all one show that was played over two weeks, Opie.  The one show that replayed 100 times.  That's good.  Well, Isaac, welcome aboard.  Hey, where are you guys at right now?  We're at Bill's Bar in Boston.  Boston?  Yeah, tell me about it.  Yeah, we're in Boston.  Well, it's opening day.  It's a real big deal as far as baseball goes.  It's the Sox and Yankees going at it.  Talk about the L.A. Dodgers.  Talk about the L.A. Dodgers, he says. 
[00:44:30]  Dude, I couldn't even tell you one player on the Dodgers.  Last Dodger I remember is Steve Garvey.  I was just going to say, if Davey Lopes takes it in the end.  Those big forearms battering his wife, his annoying wife.  Who, Garvey?  Yeah.  Steve Garvey.  How about that Tommy Lasorda?  Hey, you've got to love Tommy Lasorda.  There's our Dodgers break.  Absolutely.  That worthless team. 
[00:45:00]  You're going to find out very soon there, Isaac, that we're misinformed.  Big time on this program.  Hey, I'm the Cowboys and the Dodgers.  I love that Oral Hershizer.  All right.  Thank you, Isaac.  Bert Hooten fucks his mother.  Yeah, why not?  Let's go to Missouri and say hi to Dave.  Missouri?  We're going to say hi to a few new listeners.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Dave.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, bud. 
[00:45:30]  Name's Finario's last guy.  Buddy, mind you turn you guys on for me here a couple days ago.  I've looked at the best stuff.  And I'll tell you what, you're a breath of fresh air here in Kansas City.  Thank you.  A breath of fresh air on this show?  Well, it's Kansas City.  Of course it is.  Well, what made you not order the show before?  You weren't familiar with the program or you didn't know we were on XM?  I had no idea you guys were on here at all.  Wait, you own XM Radio and you didn't know we were on?  Somebody in marketing, get in the warm tub. 
[00:46:00]  I'm stuck listening to the phone yard and stuff like that.  Oh, cool.  I can't believe the name High Voltage didn't rope you in.  That's a popular getter.  Well, you know, there's not much going on here in the Midwest.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, welcome aboard.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  Thanks, guys.  Love you guys.  Bye, fella.  All right.  Missouri.  That's great.  Ben's raw ass wants to say hi on the phone.  Ben's raw ass is the guy's name.  Ben's raw ass.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to say today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. 
[00:46:30]  Punching out.  I guess he's getting the echo.  So the echo's that bad that you felt like you had to do the Lou Gehrig speech?  We're not hearing the echo.  All right.  One more and then we'll move on here.  Eric in Texas.  What's up, Eric?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  Thank you, sir.  Hey.  I got to tell you, we're a little rusty.  We haven't done a show in two weeks, and we're doing it in front of a bunch of animals.  Yeah.  That's okay.  They're drinking.  Go Red Sox. 
[00:47:00]  Go Red Sox.  That's right.  Go Red Sox.  Go Red Sox.  Yes.  Yeah.  Let's hear it, Boston.  All right.  What's up, Eric?  I just want to say welcome back, guys.  I've never seen you since February.  I love you guys.  Well, we could do this for three hours.  We could just take welcome back calls.  Take welcome back calls.  Great.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  Oh, don't worry.  We're not going to do that.  What's that?  Good one, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, a lot of people ask you, how did L.A. go?  It was very good. 
[00:47:30]  Jimmy, you have a job.  Yeah.  You have a job.  You have a pilot for HBO.  And, I mean, it was in front of a live audience, which was nice.  Oh, it was?  Yeah, a half-hour comedy.  And we don't know.  We had like six months to decide if they want to pick it up.  And who knows?  Did you feel it went well?  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah?  It was really funny.  Yeah.  And you finished it and everything.  Oh, yeah.  It's all done.  Yeah, it was very exciting.  Do we get to see it?  Do you get a copy of it?  Eventually, I will, yeah.  I sucked for two weeks, too.  I couldn't fucking remember my lines.  I had no acting ability. 
[00:48:00]  I was like, they're going to fire me.  After the Friday read in front of the HBO people, I'm like, they're going to fire me.  Yeah, but actually, they kept me and it went good.  How do you remember lines?  I have no clue how you would do that.  It's hard to do when you're looking at Craigslist and jacking off before in the morning.  You're like, you're supposed to be working out here, you fucking sex addict.  I'm picking up the script.  I got clear stuff on my right thumb.  And they told you to grow your hair in.  They didn't tell me.  I just had to look a little bit messier, so I didn't shave for a week.  I didn't shower for two days.  Are you going to keep this look?  No.  It's coming off.  That's not shaving for a week? 
[00:48:30]  No, no, no.  This is.  I shaved this before I flew out of L.A.  It was cool.  But the hair, I mean, that's the longest I've ever seen it in all the years I've known you.  Yeah, it'll get cut as soon as we get back to New York.  I just didn't have time.  Yeah.  I flew home and then, you know.  Herky-jerky.  Did I just heard herky-jerky and I looked.  Ben's on stage next to us, you know, because any good producer stands right by the side  of the stage to make sure they could help us out if anything.  And people are just watching him herky and jerky like it's a stage show.  Like it's the Opie and Anthony show here. 
[00:49:00]  But if you want, you can also go to like the B stage.  It's like herky-palooza.  And on the B stage, you can watch him herky and jerky.  Can we just get a spotlight on Ben for the next three hours?  And don't make Ben uncomfortable.  He hates when you look at his cock bulge.  Don't do it.  It really bothers him.  Because it's just huge in his pants.  Don't look at it.  It makes him uncomfortable.  Especially if you just stare and don't even make eye contact with him.  He's turning his bottle cap.  He's all uncomfortable.  Ben hates when he looks at this. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, that's great.  Poor Ben.  We got a question from one of these guys out here.  Oh.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Hold on one second.  We've got to get the mic on first.  There you go.  Hey, sweet sis.  Everyone online wants to know, where's the HBO tickets?  The HBO tickets, they're probably going to let you know about this week.  They did that early.  We fought really hard to get, like, so Opie and Anthony fans can have the pre-sale type  of thing.  You should know.  They got more than enough responses.  So you should probably know sometime this week or early next week, they will let you  know.  Are they sold out? 
[00:50:00]  They're free tickets.  It's not for sale.  So I don't know.  But they will let you know this week.  Okay, thanks, man.  They should, I think.  Thanks, man.  But that's why.  Do I get a ticket?  Yeah.  I would like to go to that show?  You certainly do.  I hope you guys come to both.  Of course.  That was part of the selling point.  I kind of committed you.  Wouldn't miss it for the world.  Yeah, I'm very happy, man.  Very happy.  Very nice.  Again, the echo.  It sounds like you're in a ballpark.  Try turning off the audience mic, it says, but I don't think so. 
[00:50:30]  What?  They're turning.  They're holding up all sorts of signs out there.  I see a shit dick.  Shit dick?  Jesus.  All right, why don't we take a break?  I never noticed the awful expressions on your faces in those cartoons.  I never really looked at that awful smile they give Anthony.  Yeah, look at this.  How good a geek.  And Opie with those fucking horrible sunglasses.  What is that?  My risky business sunglasses.  Oh, it's terrible.  What a couple of 1985 tools they made you guys look like. 
[00:51:00]  This is awful.  This really is bad.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll regroup.  We're at Bill's Bar with a bunch of our freaks.  Yes.  Opening day.  Red Sox get their rings this afternoon.  Ah, they stand out there on the field, get their rings in front of the Yankees.  Ooh, wow.  Wow, I wish the Yankees would know what that feels like.  Oh, right.  And a lot of controversy because Pedro doesn't want his ring, they're saying. 
[00:51:30]  Really?  The Cavs are saying, yeah, Pedro doesn't want his ring.  Why?  Because, let's see.  Yeah, they turn, man.  What do you guys think of Pedro?  He only won the World Series for these guys.  Yeah.  That Pedro's a douche.  Schilling's the guy that won the whole thing.  And David Ortiz.  Good point.  Good point, Jimmy.  All right, we'll continue.  Ortiz, they love him, but would they invite him over to their house for dinner?  No, no.  Of course not.  You're a bunch of racists.  They're all shaking their heads.  No, no, no. 
[00:52:00]  Look at their cheering on racism.  You're a bunch of racists.  Yeah.  In five years, fucking Ortiz will be sitting somewhere with Mo Vaughn.  I don't know.  They liked me at one point, too.  I don't know what the fuck happened.  They only like fucking players when they hear him on the radio, and then they see him,  they go, oh, he's a, ah, forget it.  I don't want him anymore.  Get rid of him.  Oh, awful.  All right, we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony program in just a bit.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? 
[00:52:30]  Cancel all appointments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I mean, I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  Yeah.  Fix it.  Fix it.  Guess who's back.  I'm over here now.  Back again.  Nice.  Hey, dick.  Back. 
[00:53:00]  Bag it.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  Back again.  I don't believe it.  So bad.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Back, back, back looking.  Guess who's back.  Tell her friends.  Oh, gosh.  Guess who's back.  Hey.  Guess who's back.  Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess.  Turn it off.  Back.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man. 
[00:53:30]  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  Hey.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little Opie Anthony.  Because it feels so gay without me.  I'm saying this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me, because we need a little Opie Anthony.  Because it feels so interesting without me.  Come in and out.  Okay, Carton.  Here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:54:00]  Opie and Anthony live from Boston, Massachusetts.  They know what state Boston's in, all right?  The Opie and Anthony Show, live in Boston, day two.  Tuesday, April 12th, from 7 to 11 a.m. at the Paradise, 969 Commonwealth Avenue.  For an all-ages show.  All-ages.  Dude!  I'm in my flannel with the sleeves cut off.  I got my pant leg tucked into the boot.  April 12th, from 7 to 11 a.m. at the Paradise. 
[00:54:30]  969 Commonwealth Avenue.  Opie, party rock!  Live from Boston.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh my, how ruthlessly absurd.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hello, hello.  Not a police call, but a gun.  It's the Opie and Anthony program, live from Bill's Bar.  Lansdowne Street, behind the Green Monster. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Opening day, Sox and Yankees, coming to the stage.  I guess his real name is John, but we know him as Spaulding from Caddy Stack.  Spaulding.  You guys, let's hear it for Spaulding.  How you doing, man?  Opie's wanting to, don't fall off the stage.  Hi.  Nice to meet you, buddy.  Wow.  Only the biggest celebrities for the Opie and Anthony program.  That's right.  Okay, where's the volume on this headphone?  It's really loud.  Did it just get really loud? 
[00:55:30]  Thank you, sweetie.  No, no, it's been loud.  That's, uh, wow.  Oh, thank you.  You know, come on.  One of the biggest movies ever, ever, ever, ever.  Wait, I've got to get my paparazzi glasses on.  Yeah, that's him.  I can hear it in his voice.  So, where's all the naked interns?  Well, did Ben make promises that there was going to be nudity or something?  God, and we got, we got a couple of very attractive girls here. 
[00:56:00]  That's afternoon, right?  Yeah, the mornings, it's kind of, you really got to be a whore to take your clothes off this  early in the morning.  Yeah.  You know, so it's kind of.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to be a whore.  Please, just one of you.  Please, one.  You know, we really, I think it would be really nice if Spaulding saw a pair.  I think so.  Yeah, you would wow Spaulding?  Oh, she's pointing at you like you were going to.  The one girl is pointing at the other one.  Miss, would you be willing to wow? 
[00:56:30]  Anyone?  You wouldn't?  Any ladies?  No, their parents are right outside, so that's probably.  Hey, is that.  That's probably why.  Wait.  There we go.  That'll work.  Hey, is Olivia Newton-John here?  Well, I think half the time.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  So, you guys are pretty popular in Boston, judging by the turnout this morning.  Apparently so.  Wow.  A little bit, a little bit.  Although, if the game wasn't, like, 50 feet away, I don't think they would have shown  up, but it's not. 
[00:57:00]  Get those pesky Red Sox getting in the way of your radio show.  Exactly.  Now, I've got to ask, please, I'm a huge fan of Caddyshack.  All right.  Who isn't?  What did, I looked up your name on Internet Movie Database.  Yep.  And you have one entry.  Yes.  It's Spalding.  That's it.  And that was it.  What happened?  I thought maybe that would cascade you into show business.  Well, that was certainly the plan that I had initially, but as, you know, as one run 
[00:57:30]  writer put it, you can't top that.  Really?  Nothing, yeah.  I just couldn't, you know, after that was it.  That was...  Do you have any offers?  Softcore porno?  Softcore porno.  Some bad B-horror movies shot in Denver or under another name, things like that.  But other than that, no.  And it pretty much put the kibosh on my commercial.  I was doing commercials.  You were doing commercials?  And I was the kid that, you know, barfed in the Porsche, as you know.  Of course.  And then you'd go up, and I remember the very next week I went up on a Sprite commercial. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  And the guy was, yeah, you were really funny, but we can't use you, but you were really cool,  you know.  Yeah.  Good luck.  So...  They didn't want to have that associated with their product.  And really, honestly, I haven't been, I haven't acted since probably 1982, something  like that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  What's going on with the feedback?  You're killing us.  Jaime's working on it.  Oh, that hurt.  Is that me?  Am I doing that?  No, it's just the other thing.  It's just that thing.  If you do that with that... 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, there you go.  Fix your microphone, Spaulding.  You're playing golf today.  You'll get nothing and like it.  What's everybody's favorite line?  Is that it?  You'll get nothing and like it!  I like that.  Duty was a hit, though.  I got a couple of these.  Duty.  How about we turn it up a little bit?  Hold on.  Let me hear this one.  I got it from a Negro.  That was a good one.  That's a good PC comment. 
[00:59:00]  You know, in the new versions that are showing on HBO and that, they've cut all of that out.  Are you kidding?  They cut that?  They cut that whole sequence out because it's...  Thank God for DVDs.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Were you part of the DVD that came out?  No.  Wow.  Why didn't they include Spaulding?  I was wondering that myself, but I was mentioned in it because we used to have tank battles  on the golf carts, on the golf course.  And we staged, you know, Rommel's campaign in North Africa with all the... 
[00:59:30]  So the golfers would show up in the morning and we'd be out...  We'd be out on their golf carts all night and they were supposed to be charging.  So...  And they were sort of...  We would sort of try to return them and actually put the chain back through, but they were  all muddy and broken and tires flat and the batteries all done and they couldn't figure  out what the hell was going on.  But they mentioned that in the video. 
[01:00:00]  Would you shut up?  I'm trying to conduct an interview with one of the greatest movie actors of all time.  Next to Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw, right?  Slow down.  Now, I got to know how you got it.  You were doing commercials, but...  Doing commercials.  I actually met in...  I was in New York.  I met an agent through a friend of mine who was really pissed that I got cast.  He was like...  And his agent called me and said, hey, is that...  Is that...  Okay.  She said, is that fat friend of yours still in town? 
[01:00:30]  Fat friend.  And they were...  And Michael was like, yeah.  So he called me and said, Jackie...  Her name is Jackie Walder.  Jackie wants to see you for a reading up at her office.  And about two weeks later, I read for Brian Doyle Murray.  And Doug Kenney, who's now passed away.  Yeah.  And a couple other people.  And then it was about three months later after that I got cast.  Wow.  Did you stay in touch with Ted Knight after that?  I did.  You did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ted was a real favorite.  He was a really nice guy.  Real...  Real family man.  Real... 
[01:01:00]  I mean, real solid professional actor.  When's the last time you saw any of those guys, like Rodney or, you know, Bill Murray?  Well, Rodney.  Well, I mean, you could have seen Rodney recently.  Not recently, right?  Well, I mean, up in the last 20 years, you might have seen him.  Jesus.  I don't mean this week.  I see Rodney and Ted and all those people every night.  They come to my bedroom.  The last time I saw Rodney was actually about two summers after the shoot in, like, the early 80s.  Oh, okay.  And I went to his club and kind of hung out.  It was kind of fun.  Rodney and I actually never really got along that well. 
[01:01:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He just didn't like me.  I don't know.  Can you imagine, like, this is my, you know, young actor, your first thing, and having somebody  like Rodney Dangerfield not like you, you know, that was probably why I was my first  and last.  How do you know he didn't like you?  He just...  I don't know.  He just...  He thought I was...  Wow, this is getting ready to feed back against something awful.  Is that me?  Nah, it's everybody.  It's...  This is one of our live shows.  It happens.  It's the devil.  There's nothing we can do about it.  We just have to plow on through and try.  Um, you know, I never figured out why he didn't like me. 
[01:02:00]  Really?  I just...  Well, also, I didn't really think he was funny.  I guess that's my bad.  Oh, Rodney?  Well, you've got to understand, Rodney at that time was...  His career was just taking off.  He used to...  Rodney used to enjoy...  This is yelling out character names.  Do the booger scene again.  Lacey.  Rodney would used to enjoy copious amounts of, shall we say, an herb that looks like oregano.  Oh, yeah.  He would... 
[01:02:30]  He was smoking pot all the time.  All the time.  Yeah.  He used to get high on our show.  Back in New York.  Yeah.  And he would...  You know, what he would do is he'd get really stoned at night.  And then...  Can you say that on the air?  Sure.  No, no, no.  Absolutely.  You shouldn't...  You just can't say fuck.  You just...  You'd be walking down the hall and he'd literally...  It was kind of cool because it's like Rodney, but after like a week of this, whoever it  was, he would just grab you, take you into his room and have his way with you.  No, he would just...  He would make you...  He would make you sit down and listen to his comedy routine the night before, if it 
[01:03:00]  was at the club, over and over, like literally, like hours on end.  He'd just keep...  And he'd like sit there and watch it while you're listening to it.  Yeah.  Go, that wasn't funny.  That wasn't funny.  Why aren't you laughing?  And you'd go like...  Jeez, what an asshole.  And, you know, it was kind of cool the first night, like Rodney Dangerfield really, you  know, thinks, you know, is concerned about what I think.  And after a week of it, it was like, this is really stupid.  You know, this is...  This guy is like wacko.  The other thing you would do would be...  I'm not going to get sued by his family. 
[01:03:30]  Of course.  No.  Great.  Excellent.  No.  Spaulding's paranoid.  He would be...  If he sues you, hopefully it'll be in front of Judge Smell.  Okay, Spaulding.  You don't have to pay anything.  Okay.  Get your foot off the boat.  That's a very good invitation.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Excellent.  He would also...  He was always on some kind of a diet because of, you know, that usually you work up an appetite.  Yeah.  You have to pick the thing up.  He would have all these Weight Watcher meals, like, in the room. 
[01:04:00]  And then he would eat, like, nine of them at a time.  So he was always like...  You know, there was always, like, Weight Watchers, like, frozen dinners all over the place.  Kind of canceling out the purpose of eating Weight Watchers if you eat ten of them.  Yes.  Now, you must have gotten recognized a lot when the movie came out.  No.  Actually, I was never, actually, ever, like, somebody walking down the street going, were  you that guy?  Never?  Never.  You never got known for being Spaulding?  It was only after somebody would say, hey, do you know who he was?  You should have put the hat on and gone, ahoy, polloi. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  That would have just, like, walked around.  That might have gotten people to know.  But never got recognized by that.  Nope.  Wow.  I would assume, you know, the movie's huge.  Just now I got recognized by the city of Boston.  They're towing my SUV right as we speak.  They better not.  That's all right, man, right?  That's all right.  He only had one role in the movie.  That's not nice, sir.  He was one of the, he was a fine character actor in that film.  These Boston fans are brutal.  They're just brutal.  Brutal.  They are.  Brutal.  But now you're from here.  I live in Cambridge. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  So, and you were living there when you made the movie.  And so you've been here your whole life?  No.  I was actually living in Seattle.  I was going to Seattle University at the time.  And I was visiting New York to kind of check out.  But from Boston, though?  No.  Were you born here?  No.  I moved here in 91.  91?  Yep.  All right.  Because Ben tells me you attended bar.  I did.  Is what you did.  I did.  I did.  Right around, actually, right down the street at Jake, at the old location of Jake Ivory's.  Everybody been to Jake Ivory's?  Let me do it. 
[01:05:30]  Okay.  Wow.  Not right.  Hey, Spalding.  Are you going to be in town April 29th and 30th?  Because I will be here performing at the Boston Comedy Connection.  All right.  April 29, 30.  Well, there's a good chance because I live here.  So what do you do now there, Spalding?  I sell real estate.  Wow.  You sell real estate.  I do.  I've been with Coldwell Bankers since 2000.  I've been in the business since 97.  Cool.  And you do very well with that? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Do people know who you are?  I know.  It's funny.  People who know me.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  He's got something funny to say, guys.  You can always get that look at it like, oh, he's got a funny story coming.  He's got something funny.  I don't say that specifically, although people that know me that go, you know, do you know  who, you know, I'll be literally at a showing, you know, showing a condo, Harvard Square,  blah, blah, blah.  And there's, you know, the nervous couple, blah, blah, blah.  And all of a sudden, their agent will just go, do you know who he was? 
[01:06:30]  He was that kid in Caddy Shack, the barf to the Porsche.  And the guy's like, God, that was so cool.  And the woman's like, what?  Wait, would you please concentrate on this?  Yeah.  There's always a guy who recognizes it.  Yeah.  Does it help sell the house?  I don't think I've ever had.  I think it would.  I don't think I've had a sale fall through because of it.  I really didn't want the house.  Now I kind of want it just to get it.  Yeah, I kind of want it so I have a story.  You guys sense the crowd turning here?  I think the crowd's turning.  No, no, no.  They're not turning. 
[01:07:00]  They've been in this direction the entire time.  They're brutal.  We're used to it.  It's one of those things where when you do a live show like this, you have to just, you  know, talk.  But because I don't think the hundreds of people that are here realize that there's millions  of people listening.  And it's not all about you, douchebag.  You know, if we just catered to the hundreds of drunks in this room and there are people,  my God, there are people in Missouri listening, for God's sake. 
[01:07:30]  But, you know, we have to, and I'm sure they are quite thrilled and captivated by the interview  that we are carrying on with Spaulding.  And they want to come to Boston and spend their tourist dollars here.  That's right.  And now they're going to listen to you, sons of bitches, and go, I don't want to go there.  Oh, honey.  They sound like animals.  That doesn't sound like a very safe place to go.  Hey, were you asked to do Caddyshack 2, Spaulding?  Oh, thank God, right?  They called me like a year before it shot and said, well, we're thinking, we're thinking of 
[01:08:00]  Water.  Worst remake ever, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  I think it is.  Horrible sequel.  The worst sequel to any movie ever made, ever, ever, ever.  Yeah, it was.  It really was.  Caddyshack 2.  They tried to replace Rodney with that Jackie Mason.  Ooh, Jackie Mason.  It's horrible.  What's with him?  He's Dan Aykroyd's character.  Aykroyd was really funny in that, though.  Oh, shut up.  You think so?  No, he's being sarcastic.  No, he should get prostate cancer for that role.  Thanks.  Fucking facts.  He hasn't been good since the Blues Brothers. 
[01:08:30]  What I want to know is, whose gum did I just pick up?  Yeah.  I think Ghostbusters stuck.  They did my thing.  Fucking awful.  You didn't like Ghostbusters?  No, I didn't like Ghostbusters.  I'm 36.  The first one wasn't bad.  The second one really blew, but...  That was awful.  Chasing a bunch of ghosts around New York.  That's called Ghostbusters.  That's not the color.  That's the problem in New York.  No offense.  No offense.  Boy, you're with you here.  You're fitting right in Boston.  There's another city those folks in Missouri aren't going to go to. 
[01:09:00]  Okay, check it off the list.  We're not going to Boston?  We're not going to New York?  No, Missouri, they probably would enjoy that kind of humor.  Yeah, I think they understand Missouri.  The show me state.  Show me the white people.  All right, inappropriate.  That was wrong.  Yes, it was.  So, how's the satellite radio thing working out for you, John?  Fantastic.  Yeah?  You can say what you want.  Stop rubbing me.  You can say what you want on the air.  You can say anything you want.  And thank God, imagine the problem we'd have in front of a crowd like this if every time 
[01:09:30]  they said something that couldn't go out over regular radio, we had to punch out or bleep  it or something.  We would get about ten minutes of show, actually, on the air, because they're all a bunch of  potty mouths.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, I think some people have questions for Spaulding.  Anyone have a question for Spaulding?  All right, are you into taking a few questions from the audience, Spaulding?  Absolutely.  Here we go.  All right.  When are you going to add something to this program, buddy? 
[01:10:00]  When takes the netting?  What kind of question is that?  And the funny thing is that was directed at me.  The crowd is turning.  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  All right, why don't we try another one?  All right, another question.  Honestly, man, did you get a piece out of those two chicks in that film?  Because that hot chick was, that blonde chick was fucking hot, man.  Smooth question. 
[01:10:30]  Hey, you know, I'm fucking shit-faced by now, you know?  That is a drunk individual.  Holy shit, you should have a clock in your stomach, you mumbling dummy.  Did you fuck Lacey Underall?  I was thinking, I guess, Lacey or...  Lacey Peterson?  No, not Lacey Peterson, you idiot.  Scott threw her off the diving board into a pool.  That was great.  Found little Connor floating in the pool. 
[01:11:00]  Ah, fetus!  He runs out.  He runs out.  All right, anyone else?  Spalding, no!  Anyone else have a question for Spalding?  Actually, in answer to that, no, I didn't get a piece of either one of those two.  Did you get any tail from making that movie?  You had a parlayer.  Yeah, yeah, it was a couple of...  I could see in a bar or something, you go, hey, yeah, I was...  You were who?  Yeah.  Okay.  Did you get residuals at all?  I get little checks like two or three times a year. 
[01:11:30]  They show up in the mail, and it's like, it's, you know...  What'd you get for that?  How much did they pay for that?  I'd love maybe, I don't know, maybe 15 grand.  15 grand?  Yeah.  And how long did it take?  It was SAG scale at that time.  How long did it take to film?  I was there about almost two months.  The whole thing shot, I mean, about four months, I think, down in Florida.  Wow.  Rolling Hills Country Club.  Famous for, yeah, being the golf course.  Where was that?  Where is it?  It's down in Florida.  It's in Dade County, right? 
[01:12:00]  It's kind of between Miami and...  And it's a horrible golf course, right?  It is.  It's in really bad shape.  And then they try...  You can tell when you watch the film how awful the place is.  It's really bad.  It's just a public course, right?  The big mistake they made was having the hotel where they put us next to the golf course,  because that was...  Actually, the woman who played Lacey...  Jesus, I just did it.  What?  Cindy...  Lacey Peterson.  No, Cindy Morgan.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Underall.  Lacey Peterson.  I just did it. 
[01:12:30]  I just did it.  Old anchor feet.  Oops.  Yeah, this must be an exciting...  This must be an exciting change from dreary old Modesto.  The woman who played Lacey is writing a book now about Caddyshack and the antics.  Is there actually a book there?  Is there really enough info for a book?  Maybe a pamphlet.  Yeah.  A little flyer about Caddyshack. 
[01:13:00]  Any on-set romances?  Her and Chevy, perhaps?  There was talk of that.  And none of it was...  But the woman who was in the tight red dress was a Playboy playmate.  She was Brian Doyle, Marie's girlfriend.  Remember in the scene with the bishop and that?  Yes.  She was kind of there.  She was Brian Doyle.  And we used to sneak up onto the roof, and literally about 15 of us kind of leaning over  the balcony trying to get a peek into her room. 
[01:13:30]  It was really funny.  Get a little nude shot of her.  Nice peeping Tom.  Crimes are being committed on the set.  We were kids.  LOL.  What can I tell you?  Yeah.  How old were you when you made it?  19.  You were 19.  I was 19.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  A decade.  Can you do a Spaulding line for us?  Ahoy, Palloy.  Where did you just come from?  A Scotch ad?  That's the goddamn line.  I love it.  That's it.  Now...  Ooh.  Are you guys getting on a commercial break? 
[01:14:00]  These guys like the...  Bloody Mary's for everybody.  Oh, we are in a bar, after all.  All right.  How about...  Spaulding, give us another one.  Give us another one.  One bar.  Give us something.  Jesus.  You know, I appreciate you being here.  I'm very happy here.  It's one of my favorite movies.  Apparently, I'm not adding much to this show.  Yes.  We've been excited for a long time.  You'll get nothing and like it.  Yes.  That's my favorite line.  How about Doody?  That's my favorite line. 
[01:14:30]  Doody!  Spaulding, get dressed.  You're playing golf.  Oh, that's...  I'm not playing.  What about my asthma?  I'll give you asthma.  I'll give you asthma.  All right.  Did you hear the one?  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  That's it.  No, I'm not, Grandpa.  I'm playing tennis.  No, you're not.  You're playing golf.  What about my asthma?  That's it.  That's it.  You forgot the line?  I've only got...  How many lines?  I only had five in the whole movie, but they appear to be fairly memorable.  All right, what are you...  You're walking up. 
[01:15:00]  You're at the halfway point, I guess, and you're walking up to get something to eat.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  And what did you say there?  Ah.  That's a good one, because that is one of the most often misquoted lines.  It is.  Did anyone hear that?  Yeah, I know.  They said he's choking worse than the Yankees did.  I need hamburger.  I want a cheeseburger.  I want a hot dog.  I want French fries and a milkshake.  That's the five things.  You'll get nothing in life.  You'll get nothing in life.  Right.  Right. 
[01:15:30]  All right, let's hear it for Spalding, everybody.  Ladies and gentlemen, guys.  Let's hear it for Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the way to do it.  Hey, Red Sox.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And on a positive note.  Fucking Curt Schilling in his period ankle.  I hate him.  Oh, sucker.  That's great.  Spalding, you staying around?  John?  Stick around.  John, right?  Sure.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  Very good.  Well, we don't have to take a commercial break.  Yes, we do.  We do take breaks. 
[01:16:00]  We take piss breaks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We call them piss breaks.  It's filler that the audience hates that we use to take pisses or get a drink.  There you have it.  Let's say how to Brad in Boston.  Brad, what's up?  Hey, Sox fans.  Can the Sox fans hear me?  What?  Can the Red Sox fans hear me?  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  Yankees suck.  You have to take a phone call to get a Yankees suck chant going?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  All right.  Great.  You're a big Sox fan? 
[01:16:30]  Yes, of course I am.  Yeah, of course I am.  Uh-oh.  You don't want to alienate him anymore.  He wants to sell some houses.  All right.  We're going to regroup.  We're going to take a break.  We're live from Bill's Bar in Boston.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  We've got some Mi-Fis to give away, some other XM radios.  Hey, what would you guys do for a Mi-Fi?  Anyone have any ideas?  If you have an idea...  I'll swallow a knife.  You'll swallow a knife.  There he goes.  If you have an idea, you've got to talk to Eric.  This is Eric's first road trip, by the way. 
[01:17:00]  Yes.  Yes, they usually keep him in New York.  Martini Steve stayed home, and we've got Eric up here in Boston.  Was there a reason Steve stayed home?  Yeah, he was trying to save his marriage.  Oh, God.  Did I say that?  I don't mind who would say those things.  Wow.  Yeah, because I know you always stay back in New York, Eric, and Steve loves being on  the road.  Yeah.  Because he just goes completely out of control, and I can't see him giving that up voluntarily.  Yeah?  Yeah, well, I guess Eric's going to have to go on the road from now on, because he's 
[01:17:30]  doing a great job.  I missed Steve, though.  Yeah.  Can you wear flaming attire?  Sure.  Flaming boots.  Yeah?  We might have to do that.  All right.  I missed that whole thing.  Well, can't we bring both of them?  Hold on.  We've got another assault on the media that happened.  Let me say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  We're hanging in Boston.  Man, you guys fucking rock, dude.  Listen, I've been watching Cold Pizza on ESPN2 there, and there's tons of people in the  live shop holding up ONA signs and XN signs, and it's just cool, man. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, cool.  We've got a whole pizza.  Great.  Yeah, Cold Pizza.  Thank you, Chris.  I'm a drunken morning.  All right.  Watch out, bud.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, mister.  All right.  As we go to break, if anyone has something they want to do for a MiFi or some roadies,  you've got to see Eric.  He's up over here.  Don't say, I'll do anything.  You've got to come up with something a little creative.  Let Eric know, and we'll see if it passes.  Maybe it'll have something to do with Wheelchair Fred.  Oh. 
[01:18:30]  Maybe we'll use Wheelchair Fred so someone can win a MiFi.  So think of adding Wheelchair Fred into your thing.  Wheelchair Fred, a bathtub, and some lubricant.  That's all you need.  All right.  We'll be back at Bill's Bar in just a bit.  It's the Opin' Anthony program.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Where's Gary Holley?  In the CD player.  No, when are we going to get him in studio?  Are we going to get him before Christmas, hopefully?  Yeah, but Ben is actually working on that right now. 
[01:19:00]  Are you guys booking him for Groundhog Day?  What's Ben working on?  I don't see Ben doing a whole lot of anything except eating cereal and herking him and jerking  all over the studio.  Herking him, jerking him.  And taking calls on his tiny little cell phone.  Yeah, the little tiny cell phone.  That chiclet cell phone.  If somebody walks in too fast, he can just eat his phone.  Ben's phone stinks.  What kind of phone is that?  Dude, he's always gossiping about something.  Dude, Pedro does coke.  What?  My friend Tim from Boston knows what he is.  It's always some drivel he heard from some drunken mick at a party. 
[01:19:30]  And Dan, I'm like, yeah, I'm bono from U2 is coming in.  It's like horse shit.  Dude, I comb my hair with a car bomb.  You forgot that.  That's insane.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  It's insane.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  He just giggles about nothing.  I'm like, Ben, I got to get this done.  Giggling, idiot.  He was laughing when you guys were talking serious about the death penalty. 
[01:20:00]  Did anyone else get it?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, dude, there's just too many poor people that get it.  Here he comes.  Here he comes.  Who doesn't love Ben?  I like the parody of Ben better than Ben now.  I thought someone got one of their teeth knocked out.  It was Ben's phone.  Your phone needs a filling.  I love the fact that he's always gossiping.  Always gossiping about somebody who has something to do with Boston. 
[01:20:30]  Jim Rice is from Western Children.  What?  Easy.  Oh, man.  Guys, yeah, that's fun.  Let me see your phone, Ben.  Got it on you?  Where'd you lose it?  Look at this.  Look how little that is.  Wow.  Tell me some small phones.  That stinks anyway.  It doesn't work at all.  It's a tiny little phone. 
[01:21:00]  That Ben parody is hilarious.  I wish people could see it and they just, you don't know Ben.  Yeah, they get it.  You just got to know Ben.  He's so herky.  He's always moving around.  He's so jerky.  And he just always laughs in the wrong places.  When you're like being serious, you're like, dude, look, I'm running late.  Look, here's some gossip.  Yeah, there's some gossip.  It's like a market.  It's like guns.  What? 
[01:21:30]  Always gossiping.  Always a little gossip.  Wow.  Because he does.  He knows everyone in Boston.  Everyone.  Any bit of news that comes out of Boston.  He knows everything about Boston.  Everything that the common folk read about in Boston, he will know like ten layers deep  into the story.  I was trying to hang out with Tom Brady.  What?  What happened with Tom Brady?  It's like some scandal that never materializes.  He was with ten broads or something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:22:00]  I think that was the Tom Brady gossip.  Yes, I got that call.  Dude, I was with the Crafts at the new stadium.  There's a body buried in the basement.  It's insane.  I swear.  What?  It's crazy.  It's insane.  It's nuts.  I would have called you, but my phone was in my ear.  I couldn't get it out.  Someone got a toothpick.  I got my phone stuck between my teeth.  I got to pick it out, dude.  This phone makes me physically ill.  O.P. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Live from Boston, Massachusetts. 
[01:22:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Anthony and I do not have to do a smart radio program anymore.  Be-de-be-de-de-de-de-de-de.  Shut up.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  Live from Build Fire in Boston.  It's the O.P. and Anthony program.  Opening day for the Sox.  I notice you guys are very, very quiet as far as the Yankees.  Well, I don't blame you. 
[01:23:00]  I just want to make the observation.  Everybody knows I'm a Yankee fan.  It's not a secret.  I mean, you know, whatever.  It's been a hard to, you know, what are you going to get?  Get them all rah-rah for the Yankees?  Yeah.  They've obviously got their team, and they're not going to change.  And there's a lot more of them than you guys.  Yeah, you're not going to hear, you know, he's right.  Fuck Boston.  So we deal with it.  The Red Sox have Rivera figured it out, too, man.  It really is frustrating.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you can't hear it?  Sweeney.  Jaime.  All right.  Jaime.  Jaime. 
[01:23:30]  Jaime is doing a great job over there.  Got it.  There we go.  Also, I'm hearing that there's a webcam.  Yeah, apparently somebody has a webcam.  Is it the gang from 411?  Yeah, Ziggy has his cam set up over there.  Where?  Ooh.  Laptop and the camera's right there.  Well, let's talk to Ziggy real fast.  Thanks, Pumpkin.  Yeah, supposedly there's a webcam.  People are checking us out on the web, but all they see is a big, dark shadow.  Dark mass as well.  We're backlit.  Yeah.  So that's not really a good way to...  Yes? 
[01:24:00]  Fantastic.  Yeah, we got a webcam.  I don't know where you'd log on to see it if you're not here.  Well, that's why we're trying to find Ziggy, so...  Where is Ziggy?  Ziggy is...  The Merrill Lynch beer spinner and Ziggy?  Well, this was the big plug for Ziggy, and he's nowhere...  And he's not around.  Where's the...  Missed his moment.  It's 411...  XM411.com.  You can see the webcam, which is just a dark, dark shadow. 
[01:24:30]  Hold on to me again.  Good luck to you.  All right.  A lot of controversy right now, because they're trying to find Ziggy.  Oh, well.  I hear we had a lot of press here.  Us coming up, Opie.  And...  Oh, it's still opening day.  Mentioning Opie and Anthony are coming here to broadcast live from opening day.  And there was one thing that caught my attention.  And I thought maybe that, since we were on vacation, you had been...  You had been maybe wheeling and dealing.  Making other deals. 
[01:25:00]  Making other deals.  Well, it was in...  I know sometimes you voice your displeasure with some of the things that happen around XM.  No, I'm a happy person these days.  Yeah.  It was page three of the Boston Herald yesterday.  They mentioned how we're broadcasting live.  Uh-huh.  It was pretty huge.  Nationally syndicated morning team, Opie and Anthony, from XM Radio.  Satellite Radio's home for MLB.  We'll broadcast from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow.  Uh-huh.  Meeting today at Bill's Bar.  Yeah.  And then they also mentioned that we're going to be at the Paradise tomorrow doing our real morning show  from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  I think tomorrow we'll actually get some radio done.  Maybe we'll actually talk about things.  I don't think any of these freaks will be there tomorrow.  Oh.  I'm just...  I'm thinking.  So then, also, there's a gossip page called Inside Track with the manatees.  We like to call these girls the manatees.  Oh.  Now, they know us.  We've sat down.  We've spoken with them.  It's Gail and Laura from the Inside Track.  And I guess I made the column.  It says, Connection Cheese Bill Blumenreich chowing with Sirius Radio Brad Opie at Lucky's. 
[01:26:00]  Sirius.  Sirius.  Yeah.  Why?  What?  Yeah.  Well, Bill Blumenreich, he owns the Comedy Connection up here in Boston.  Jimmy's going to be playing there.  Yes.  And a bunch of...  He has no clue where you work.  No.  And he claims to be a friend of mine.  Yeah.  And he has no idea where I'm even working.  Because he obviously called the manatees and said that he was hanging out with me. 
[01:26:30]  Because they don't...  They don't...  They didn't see us.  Bill Blumenreich chowing with Sirius Radio Brad Opie.  And no, it's spelt like the company, not Sirius.  Like Opie was all Sirius that day.  Yes, let me sit here with you.  And apparently you should have told him where you worked.  It just shows that he's a dummy.  He really is.  A dummy with a horse cock.  That's the story that we told on the air.  Ben and I were snooping in his place one day. 
[01:27:00]  And we found the Magnum XL condoms and a bunch of blue Viagra pills.  That's nice.  Not only do you have a giant cock, but it doesn't go soft ever.  That's going to be nice for the poor victim he brings home.  So I thought perhaps you...  Well, the blood left his brain.  And that's why he didn't know where I was working, I guess.  I thought you were wheeling and dealing.  Sure.  It's going to be the Howard and Opie show.  Oh, I'm serious.  Anyway.  At least we're in the paper.  Yeah, we made the paper.  It's very hard to find anything in the Boston papers. 
[01:27:30]  It's all Red Sox stuff today.  Enough Red Sox stuff in the paper, guys.  Oh, Red Sox, Red Sox, and the Pope's dead.  At least it'll help my stock.  Your serious stock is fucked, bro.  Yeah, I hope you bought in at nine, you prick.  It's awful.  Opie, we're not all making $30 million a year, you know.  I don't make...  I invented serious stock, you know.  You really bought that serious stock?  What a dummy.  What did you get in at? 
[01:28:00]  I got in at $297.  All right, well.  Oh, okay.  So you're making some cake.  There are some people that got in at the recent peak at like nine.  I heard how it was going.  I knew the money would go up, and now I own serious stock.  I'm an XM listener, so fuck them.  All right.  There you go.  Well, the stock's not going to go up to XM prices, though, ever.  That was our stock analysis break from Boston.  So fuck them.  CNBC is now doing dick jokes.  We retired that line.  We retired the dick joke line. 
[01:28:30]  We retired that line.  Well, then Fox News is now doing dick jokes.  No, we reinvented it.  That's better.  Fox News sounds better.  We retired all that stuff.  Yeah, you got to move on.  All right, well.  When was the last time Opie used the sex in a mosque, and we'd be heroes line?  Yeah.  I retired that line.  Jimmy, I got a question for you.  Okay, sir.  Take out your cell phone, Jim.  I figured out why you make fun of...  Do you actually want me to pull it out?  I want you to pull it out right here, Jimmy.  It's not happening.  What do you want me to ask?  I want to know why you have Zach Morris' cell phone from Saved by the Bell 
[01:29:00]  when you make fun of fucking Ben's cell phone all the time.  I'm surprised you don't have to have that plugged into a car to make it work, stupid.  Wow.  Throw in cell phone.  It's a Palm Pilot that...  Hey, don't smash the guy.  I'm not smashing it.  I'm not smashing it.  He had a good line.  Just take it.  Just take it.  I'm just responding.  But just take it.  That was a good one.  Wow, is he bashing you?  And the fact that he knows the guy's name from Saved by the Bell, you fucking homo. 
[01:29:30]  Hey, that was much better than talking to Spaulding.  Let's just talk like it is.  Spaulding was good.  No, he wasn't.  No, he wasn't.  There goes that.  Spaulding, you'll do an interview and like it.  All right, a bunch of people complaining on the phone lines.  Let's say hi to Timmy in Wisconsin.  Hey, Timmy.  Timmy.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, Timmy?  Do you guys realize the crowd is ruining the show?  Yes. 
[01:30:00]  How is this crowd ruining the show?  They won't shut the fuck up.  I can't even hear you guys half the time.  Fuck you guys.  Wow, there's a fight going on between the crowd here and somebody on the phone.  We're as surprised as you are, sir.  A bunch of drunk people outside of Fenway Park opening day.  I mean, we thought it would be nice and quiet.  We can't believe that they're actually rowdy.  Oh, hey.  Hey, Timmy, we're not going to lie to you. 
[01:30:30]  We knew this was a really bad idea.  Oh, yeah.  It had cluster as fuck written all over it.  Yeah, go ahead, Timmy.  One more thing for the Red Sox fans.  Milwaukee Brewers in 2008.  Milwaukee Brewers in 2008.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  I wonder what the other stations, because there's a lot of broadcasts going on here for opening day,  all up and down Fenway, up and down Lansdowne.  And I wonder if they're having the same type of show we're having today.  A bunch of drunks in front of them. 
[01:31:00]  No, it's all game analysis.  You think they're able to talk about the game.  You know, they've got their stats in front of them.  And they actually have guests on the program that might be able to talk about the game.  We got Spalding.  Even though Ben told me for the last two days that it's going to be off the hook.  There's going to be so many people for us to talk to that we're not going to have enough time to do a radio show.  Ben did make it look like this was going to be a star-studded event.  You think WBZ right now is talking to Dean Warmer's wife? 
[01:31:30]  Those fucking awful analyst shows, those are terrible.  Yeah, they've just got to stay in the game, you know, and keep playing until the ninth hour.  Fuck you, we know.  I hate sports analysts.  They're bores, all of them.  Well, there's plenty of it going on up and down the street.  What's the cliche-slinging douchebags.  All right, let's say hi to Randy in Kentucky.  Hey, Randy, what's up?  I thought I saw another broadcast truck out there, but it was actually Jimmy's phone.  He had dropped it in the street, and it looked like one of those.  Thank you, sir.  That's very funny that we can now goof on his big phone. 
[01:32:00]  My phone is not that big.  It fits in my little hand.  We're going to be talking about that big phone for the next month.  You can talk about it all you want.  You can talk about it all you want.  All right, what's up, Randy?  Not much.  Ah!  Hold on.  Wow.  Tell those fucking feeders to shut up.  Oh, thank you, mister. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  There you go.  And big phone sucks.  You've got to get to enjoy it, you know, because you've got to wait for something to fucking happen.  So, enjoy your feeders.  All right, thank you, Randy.  Did this guy say fuck one more time?  I know.  Randy, not happy with the crowd here in Boston. 
[01:33:00]  I like the way the callers throw out this vile shit and then leave us to deal with it.  Yeah.  Stir them up.  Boston sucks.  They should all get prostate cancer.  Punch it out.  Hey, Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Well, the crowd's getting drunker, and we're getting more scared up here.  What's up, Brian?  I was watching a movie last night called The Corporation, and they cut to a scene where  it's just a huge Mookie and Anthony wow band in the middle of the movie.  Check it out.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[01:33:30]  Boston sucks.  All right, thanks.  I don't know.  Is there anything to that?  I don't know.  I have no idea what that is.  I want to know when our celebrities are coming.  Yeah, let's talk to Ben.  Let's get Ben on the horn here.  When's the next one?  We've already had Spalding.  Wait, did Ben really say it was going to be like so many people, we wouldn't have time  to do the radio show?  Pretty much, yeah.  I didn't say that.  Wow.  You said we had so many guests for today's show, right?  Yeah, we did.  We did.  We did.  Was there a tsunami in Boston this morning?  What happened?  Where did they go? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, where did they go?  I don't know.  You made a sound...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  We had some people.  We had some people pending.  All right.  We got Godsmack coming in a little bit.  All right.  Who's pending?  He counted Godsmack as like four of five celebrities.  Yeah.  A whole bunch of them.  We got the guitarist, the drummer, the singer.  There's four guys in the band.  So that's four guys.  Maybe we should have saved Spalding for the grand finale.  Is that what you're trying to tell us?  Well, maybe that could have been the showstopper.  Well, it was the showstopper.  We just blew our load already.  We should have waited to 1.30 to talk to Spalding. 
[01:34:30]  To bring on Spalding.  Well, I'm looking at Eric.  Have we gotten to anybody that wants to win a MyFive?  Yes, we do.  He has an idea?  Yeah, I'll let Wheelchair Fred backwash a beer into a cup and I'll pound it.  Ooh.  Wow.  So Wheelchair Fred takes a big swig of beer and then he backwashes it back  and he spits it out of the cup and you will then drink it.  I will do that.  That's disgusting.  Wow.  We'll see if someone can beat that. 
[01:35:00]  Why don't you just chew his gum after he spits it out?  Jimmy was doing that last night.  I spit my gum at him.  He picks it up off the couch, throws it in his mouth.  And ate it.  Ah!  I just couldn't let him one up.  That is...  Like we're in third grade.  Yes, sir.  You have an idea?  Well, this is going to be a lot more difficult than that.  I'm going to attempt to comb Ben's hair.  Oh, wow.  No, no.  Let's talk to the...  I need two my-fives if I can accomplish that.  Let's talk to the EMT guys.  I think that might be too dangerous. 
[01:35:30]  And then I'm going to carry his hog through the crowd.  All right.  So you need a back brace and a rake.  All right.  Anyone else has something they want to do for a my-five?  Ben's cock is so big, someone thought it was a serious unit.  Go ahead, buddy.  I'll do a shot of Jaeger out of his belly button.  A belly button shot out of wheelchair Fred.  That's not that gross, actually. 
[01:36:00]  It's just a belly button.  It's awful, but it's more homoerotic, but it's nothing...  It's hot and sexy, but...  Yeah, of course it is.  Yeah, just a thought.  Wheelchair Fred.  Hey, will somebody make out with wheelchair Fred for...  Hey, that's the bit right there.  Of course it is.  We get a guy to make out with wheelchair Fred for my five-year-old.  Yeah, yes.  Of course a guy.  Of course a guy.  I will make out with another guy.  How about for money, Fred?  How about for money?  I don't care. 
[01:36:30]  Take his money away from him.  Take his money away from him.  Maybe a million dollars I'll make out with.  A million bucks?  Oh, Scott, Pat.  All right, we'll do it.  Put that on him.  I'll do your bag of shells.  I don't know, but I heard my name in there.  It really scared me.  That sounded like a guess.  What's he going to do?  What's he going to do?  Yeah.  It's not gay if he doesn't have the muscle to push back.  It's not gay if he doesn't have the muscle to push back. 
[01:37:00]  That's very good, bro.  Yeah, old Bob Dole arm legs.  Oh, God.  I have a good one.  Will any guys...  He spilled my coffee.  Will any guys get...  I'm sorry, Kenny.  I think there's something there with wheelchair-free.  Yeah, wheelchair-free.  Yeah.  A little more than even the backwash thing, I think.  Yeah.  We need something that really says, boy, I want it on my five. 
[01:37:30]  How about backwash with a booger on the end of the cup?  We need something where people will be talking about this broadcast for months to come.  Well...  And what already happens is falling.  To earn his money in the box, he's got to put the Krusty mask on, I think, and crawl across the floor naked.  Oh.  Someone else yelled, who wants to see that, you shit dick?  Speak for yourself, sir.  That would be hot.  Man crawling.  All right, if you have something you want to do for my five, I just got to say hi to Hawk there in the front.  Yes.  Yeah.  Let's go back to the phones and say hi to... 
[01:38:00]  Andre.  Hello, guys.  How are you today?  What's up, Andre?  Hello.  Well, I love the interaction between the callers and the crowd. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  There's such love there.  You and that fucking crowd, the drunk mick cocksuckers, fucking like them.  Drunk mick cocksuckers.  All right, there he goes, Andre.  Let's say hi to Jason in Texas.  Jason, what's up?  Oh, I can you see...  What?  I love the life...  Why is it...  I love the life so much... 
[01:39:00]  What is it...  What is it...  There you are.  Singing the national anthem.  Jesus.  That really wasn't a 40-minute setup.  Can I say something to Henry?  Hey, Henry.  Never forget, if it wasn't for us, you'd all be speaking German, motherfucker.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  So, let's talk to Wheelchair Fred. 
[01:39:30]  Is he having a good time?  Is he getting drunk?  Is he...  Are you getting money, Fred?  No, I need pussy.  He needs pussy.  He needs pussy.  You might want to...  Yes.  Wheelchair Fred, you might want to turn around and see that that ain't possible today.  No.  You are dick high to everybody right now.  He turns around and he's got a face full of guy junk.  Yes.  No pussy here.  There's no...  No, there's not a lot.  Are you a pussy? 
[01:40:00]  Nope.  Great.  Are you a pussy?  No.  Fred's now doing interviews.  You're not a pussy.  All right.  Well, I'm drinking a strawberry daiquiri.  I don't think that makes me a pussy.  It was banana, you ass.  He's a pussy.  That's right.  And he didn't drink it.  It was thrown on his back.  Mike, you smell like wine.  All right.  Yeah.  Why don't we take the microphone away from Wheelchair Fred.  Thank you, Fred.  You're awful.  Is he collecting money, though, so he can get home?  Or you're going to have to drive him home, too?  Oh.  You're going to have to drive him home? 
[01:40:30]  All right.  There's his box.  See, we have a little money box for him.  Well, every time we pass it through the crowd, there's less money.  I know.  They keep sticking their hands and stealing it.  I saw some dude picking money and buying shots for everyone in the back.  Yeah.  The money's in our box over there.  Another round.  Oh, that man just contributed.  Yeah.  Hey, Fred, you might actually have some money in that thing by the end of this.  Do you want me there tomorrow?  What?  What?  Oh, do we want him there tomorrow?  Yeah.  Well, he wants to leave now so he can get there in time. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Yeah, he's got to roll down the street.  Go away, you bad boy.  Let's chalk his wheels and just watch him struggle.  I need a plane to crash tonight.  You what?  I need a plane to stay.  He needs a plane.  Either he wants a plane to crash or he needs a place to crash.  A place to stay.  Oh, you need a place to stay.  A place to stay.  Well, Ben's got two beds in his room.  Ben?  Ben. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, Ben.  Ben, you could have Wheelchair Fred stay over your place, right?  Yeah, could you just put your cock in your bed with you?  All right.  I'm talking to Tom Brady doing coke.  You're the most unconnected guy in Boston.  Jesus Christ.  Ben was excited for two days, Anthony, telling me about everyone that was going to be on the  show today.  You were supposed to play the poker.  You were excited about the guest. 
[01:42:00]  I was all excited because Ben calls me up and tells me, dude, dude, there's a celebrity  poker tournament taking place in Boston, and I think I, he goes, I think I could get  you in.  And I'm like, that's great.  He goes, I, I, I, I, I, I, it's going to be everybody.  Ben Affleck, Ben Affleck, my team, James Woods, Stephen King, they're all going to be  in there.  Yeah, Stephen King, that was another one we had.  Dude, you're, I, I get you in and I was like, okay, this sounds good.  Keep me posted.  I heard nothing until last night when I get a text message as I'm driving here that 
[01:42:30]  says, poker don't look good.  25 grand they wanted for you to play.  They wanted 25 G's?  You should have hit up Opie.  Yeah, right.  That's, that's nothing.  You know what?  Opie's got that in the, uh, in the seats of his car.  Like, you could just reach down.  You bet I do.  And there's 25 large just sitting there.  All right, so the poker thing didn't happen.  Poker thing never happened.  Okay, so the poker thing.  How did it go?  Did you hear about it?  Yeah, it's in the paper.  Oh, it's in the paper.  It's in the paper.  What celebrities were there? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, who was there?  I, I don't know.  I didn't look at it.  All right, well.  Affleck didn't show up.  He had a different, he didn't, uh, he went to Todd English things.  Oh, Affleck.  Affleck, Affleck's done some good movies, though.  That's Ben Affleck, by the way.  He just calls him Affleck.  And then he told me that he met, you met Drew Barrymore, right?  Yeah, well, I, yeah, kind of.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I talked to her, yeah.  The fever pitch for me was there the other night.  Did she kiss you on the cheek?  No.  No?  No.  I heard she kissed you on the cheek.  You told me.  I kissed you on the cheek.  You told me that she kissed you on the cheek and you had the lipstick still on your cheek. 
[01:43:30]  Oh.  You did say that.  Oh, Paul, he told me.  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you guys, all right.  Okay.  You said that?  Yes, you did.  Who else heard it, Ope?  You guys are unbelievable.  You guys are unbelievable.  Well, I guess our next guest are here.  Oh, guest.  Who's our next guest?  You'll see.  Let's see what's in.  Mark Parenteau.  Hey.  Hey.  How are you doing?  All right.  Well, there's.  Yeah.  Bring on the boys.  There's Ben.  Let's go back to the phone and say hi to Billy in New York. 
[01:44:00]  Billy, what's up?  Billy Matthews, boys.  Welcome back.  Thanks, Billy.  Thank you.  Hey, I just want to congratulate the Red Sox fans for being in last place on ring day.  Red Sox fucks fans you.  Wow.  Well, he had a point.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim in New York.  Jim?  Jim?  Oh.  Yeah, you're on.  You.  This is up in New York.  Whatever.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:44:30]  What do you have to say?  All right.  Thanks.  That guy.  Good call.  Great call representing New York, you tool.  That was the worst call of the day right there.  What an ass.  Great.  It was supposed to be poker with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.  Turns into quarters with goddamn Spaulding.  Dino.  Look at him.  He's trying his best to make this...  A legitimate affair.  A legitimate guest affair.  What's up, Ben? 
[01:45:00]  Tell us.  What's going on?  What's happening?  Don't be careful of the thing you have to put on your head.  Shut up, Dick.  All right.  What's up, Dino?  What's up, what?  Go ahead, Ben.  Nothing.  What do you want?  Where's the guest?  The guests are coming.  Who are they?  They're coming in.  Okay.  I thought it was imminent.  Huh?  I thought it was imminent, like they were here.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they are.  No, you said there's another guest ready to go.  Who's our next guest?  Not the ones we know are coming, but who's the other guest?  The surprise guest.  Hold on.  I've had a rough couple weeks, okay? 
[01:45:30]  You're okay.  He hurts when he should have jerked.  Yeah, through Mary Moore, kissed me on the cheek.  Let's talk about your limo that you need from the airport to your hotel that's two miles away.  Why not?  I would say, exactly.  Important people get cars sent for them.  Travel diva.  I need a limo.  I need tickets to the game.  I want tickets to the game.  I wanted a ticket to the game, and Ben said he could probably get me a ticket to the game.  He's like, well, I got one ticket, but I'll give it to you.  No, I tried to get XM to give you the ticket.  Who'd you give the ticket to that you had? 
[01:46:00]  I gave it to a friend of mine.  Who?  It's irrelevant.  Who?  What's his name?  Tom Brady?  Spalding?  What's his name?  Why is it a secret?  I've had enough.  It doesn't matter.  Who is it?  Nobody.  Nobody that you know.  But you have two Yankee friends right here.  Yeah, we're good friends.  You know how hard these fucking tickets were to get?  Oh, who's this other guy that's so cool that he gets...  What's his first name?  Oh, Ben is...  Oh!  What?  He's walking.  Ben, you don't want to do that in front of this crowd, man.  Yeah, where are you going to go?  I know, exactly.  Where are you going to go?  It's going to get worse. 
[01:46:30]  We have to have those headphones built around your head.  You can't just take them off.  So come on, man.  Who is the guy?  I wanted the Yankee ticket.  Anthony wanted to go see the bars.  It wasn't my ticket.  It was someone else's ticket.  And I offered it back up.  It was the only one ticket.  It wasn't your ticket.  Ben.  So it wasn't your ticket to even give?  No, no, no, no, no.  It was my ticket.  It was your ticket, but it wasn't...  You're fucking dead, Jim.  Bernie Gets was better on the stand.  What's going on?  Hey, hey.  Oh.  Yeah?  Wow, we got another...  Oh!  We got another wheelchair guy. 
[01:47:00]  Hey!  Oh, cool.  Nice.  Let's do some jousting.  Jousting.  Oh, wait.  That means Ben's off the hook.  That's not cool.  We'll get Ben back on the hook.  Don't worry.  All right.  There's some unknown ticket that didn't belong to him that he gave to somebody he's not saying.  Dude, it was...  I don't think there was a ticket.  I'm going out on a limb here.  You think?  Yeah.  I don't think there was a ticket.  Well, I had a ticket.  I pulled out of a Wonka bar in 1971. 
[01:47:30]  Don't worry.  The elevator shot through the roof, dude.  He gave me the whole joint.  I had a ticket.  I had a ticket.  Hold on, hold on.  Put Ben's mic back on.  All right.  Go ahead, Ben.  I absolutely had a ticket.  Okay.  You had a ticket?  I had a ticket.  I had a ticket.  You had a ticket.  Who'd you give it to?  I gave it back to my dad.  My dad had a ticket.  Do you think he had the tickets?  He had the tickets.  Okay, but who did he...  But why did he give it to me or Ann?  He gave it to one of his employees.  But why?  Because his employee was doing a good job.  So he took your ticket and gave it to the employees?  No, I could have gone.  I didn't want to go.  The one seat was a grandstand seat. 
[01:48:00]  Why didn't you tell your dad,  Dad, that's my ticket.  My French.  Yeah.  Because you're a pain in the ass.  You drive me crazy.  You're a fucking pain in the ass.  And he didn't want to go to the game.  It's not like it's a big game today or anything.  Nah.  They give out the rings before the game.  It's not a big deal.  He'll go to the next time that happens.  No biggie.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to this wheelchair guy out there.  What's his name?  This is Lawrence.  Lawrence.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing, man? 
[01:48:30]  Good.  Good?  Yeah.  Fan of the program?  Yeah.  Hey, Lawrence.  What's up?  What's up with you?  How long have you been listening?  For a while.  Yeah?  Did you listen to us when we were up here in Boston?  Yeah.  Ah, there we go.  He's a huge fan of the show, Anthony.  He's down the front row.  Wheelchair Fred has his arms folded.  He's all pissed off because this guy's going to take the spotlight.  That's right.  You don't like seeing a bigger disaster than you, do you, Fred?  And is that an electric wheelchair? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Fred, what do you think of that?  He's got a Cadillac and you're sitting there in a...  Hold on.  Let's get the wheelchair guys.  Yeah, let's make them hate each other.  I'm not that lazy.  I'm not that lazy.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Lawrence.  That's true, Fred.  He's got a woman with him. 
[01:49:30]  That's true.  He's got a woman.  He's wheeling him.  Go ahead, Lawrence.  Yo, what's up?  Oh, shit.  All right.  What's up?  I like Lawrence.  You're not here.  Yeah?  All right.  Very good.  Well, we got our wheelchair section now.  We actually have a handicap section.  Or handicapable.  Capable.  What's up?  We've got a bunch of the guys from Godsmack, I see. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Very nice.  You want to take a break so we can get some microphones?  All right.  It's Opie Anthony broadcasting live from Bill's Bar.  Godsmack has just entered the building.  We'll talk to them next.  What happens creatively that all of a sudden, yeah, you do, you shut off your brain, you  know, like you said, you're in this really nice mansion looking at four to five million  dollar paintings.  Yeah.  You know, and then all of a sudden, because you're living this new life, your creativity 
[01:50:30]  starts to go away, I guess.  That's true.  It happens.  We've got to watch out for that, Opie.  You know?  That was kind of thinking about us watching this movie.  Got to watch out for that.  A little bit.  Let's go to Sally in Minnesota.  Get those burps in your apartment like a chair.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  You know, you'll start going, hey, here we go.  Now I'm living the life.  You don't have to worry about me.  But I did order a dresser. 
[01:51:00]  Thank you.  You did?  Thank you.  Yes.  Breaking news on the Opie Anthony program.  A dresser?  Where have you kept your clothes up until now?  On the floor.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Stop it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I can't even believe this.  Hold on, Sally.  Okay.  Your clothes are piled on the floor of your room.  Anthony, I...  How long have you been there?  Three years.  Three years you haven't had a dresser?  No.  What is wrong with you?  I just, like, I live differently. 
[01:51:30]  I can't...  I don't know what it is.  Differently?  That's differently than anybody in this country.  I like being kind of...  I like having the feeling that I'm, like, a free spirit.  And I don't know.  Free spirit?  I did...  Like you're squatting?  I finally got, like, a CD slash DVD rack, too.  Because all my CDs and DVDs were just kind of thrown around the living room, you know.  On the floor.  Yeah.  How did you...  Now, where did you buy this dresser?  I'm fascinated.  Just around my neighborhood. 
[01:52:00]  You didn't find it out on the sidewalk?  No, no, no, no, no.  I've been buying nice stuff.  Yeah.  It's just been a very slow process.  I don't know.  Very slow process?  Three years.  Three years to get a dresser goes beyond a slow process.  Yeah, that's beyond a slow process.  I understand.  I'm getting it together slowly.  Wow.  Yeah.  I am stunned that you just kept your clothes on the floor.  I get them cleaned and all, and then I just pile them up nice.  That's all.  And then when you need to get dressed, you just, like, look through the pile? 
[01:52:30]  You don't have...  No, I have it kind of organized, you know.  Shirts, jeans.  Yeah.  In piles?  Yeah.  In piles on the floor?  Yeah.  Do you have a bed?  A really nice bed.  It's a nice bed?  Yeah.  But is it just a mattress on the floor?  No, no, no, no, no.  It actually has a headboard?  No.  Are you insane?  You don't have a headboard-type bedroom set?  I have the mattress and the box spring and the little, uh, little, uh...  You have a metal frame... 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  ...that the mattress and box spring sits on, and that's it.  That's it.  You have no headboard?  It's not important to me.  No night tables?  No.  Take your change and put it out and your watch and put it...  This is stuff human beings do.  Yes.  But it doesn't bother me.  Where's your alarm clock?  I know you say you don't need it and don't use it, but where is it?  No, I do need it because of the new hour.  I, uh, it's on the floor.  It's on the floor.  Yeah.  How high up is your bed?  Because I know my bed is pretty high up.  It's really high because I got the extra mat, you know, the extra whatever pad and stuff.  Can you see the clock from your bed? 
[01:53:30]  No.  Of course not.  You're living like a homeless guy, shacked up.  I know.  It's cool in a way.  It has that college feel to it.  College feel.  But really nice stuff.  Bag of marshmallows in the room just in case you really want that college feel.  But really nice stuff, though.  I got a really nice, you know...  Nice stuff?  What stuff?  Sound system.  You need stuff to have nice stuff.  I have stuff.  I got couches, a leather chair.  I got some nice things. 
[01:54:00]  I would think.  I bought a $500 piece of art, so I'm starting.  Not art, though.  Arch.  Smart.  How about a bed?  That's just...  I have a bed.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony live from Boston, Massachusetts.  They constantly portray abnormal sexual behavior as being normal.  It's like pinning down an alcoholic and pouring vodka down his throat.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we're back live from Boston at Bill's bars.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  With Lul, Jimmy Norton in house, of course.  Flew in from L.A. just to do the show. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Now that he's a big Hollywood star.  I'm a fucking nobody everywhere.  And we got to say hi to some old friends, Anthony.  Godsmack in the house.  Bill's bar.  Boston.  Yeah.  They were telling me off mic that they're Hugh Janky fans, so that's really cool.  Oh.  Oh.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, Opie.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hey, Opie.  Fuck you.  Of course, you guys must just be caught up in this whole thing, too, right?  Yeah? 
[01:55:30]  Big fans.  Big fans.  Lifelong, right?  Oh, God, you fucking Boston people.  Jeez.  Oh, no, no.  Fuck you.  What do you mean?  You worked in Boston?  Were you a traitor?  I worked here, but I came from New York, and that was the problem.  You know, it was one of those things.  But, no, I am just to have, you know, have fun with it and everything.  Hey, give us a break, all right?  I absolutely am.  I'm not, I have probably been the most sympathetic Yankee fan for quite a while.  I have our own Ben, who has been through the crap with the Red Sox for years and years. 
[01:56:00]  I sympathize with him.  So, this is just, you know, I have to take it, you know?  Yes, it was the biggest choke in baseball history.  Yes, we've got our asses handed.  I was going to say that on their rings.  The World Championship, it says it on the rings.  Oh, it does.  Biggest comeback in baseball history, yeah.  On the inside of the rings, that's what it says.  It wasn't a comeback when the other team self-destructs.  It's not a comeback.  That's a way to look at it.  Little League team could win if the other team plays like the Yankees did. 
[01:56:30]  Jesus Christ.  Awful.  What a choke.  Oh, my God.  Look who it is.  Who?  That's Bill Lee, the spaceman.  Oh.  Hey, there you go.  He is.  Wow.  This is our star-studded event.  It absolutely is.  It's starting to become a star-studded event.  How you doing?  Solidarity.  Solidarity.  Solidarity.  I'm Lefluenza.  I'm the new Pope. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  That's Bill Lee, of course, the spaceman.  Spaceman Bill Lee.  And, Bill, this is God Smack on stage.  God Smack.  Hi, guys.  I got the same hat at home.  You do.  CCCP.  Right.  I'm a left winger from way back.  The only way I'm going to D.C.  is if I'm taking it over.  I'm way before these kids.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:57:30]  This crowd is ruthless, man.  Who's he with?  Who's that?  My wife.  Oh, I meant the big thing.  Oh, my family.  My whole family.  Oh.  Yeah, it's opening day.  Welcome, welcome.  Yeah, well, you must be very excited.  Well, I'm a ring bearer.  Oh, yeah.  I dress up in a little dress,  and then I have to carry a little purple pillow around with a ring on it.  That sounds adorable.  It is adorable.  You guys are on the satellite, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go figure. 
[01:58:00]  Way up there in space.  And I always thought the space program was a hoax.  Very good.  Look at that.  What did he give us?  This and Teflon.  And Tang.  Everyone's a smartass.  Everyone from Boston's a smartass.  You're right.  We're just in a bad, bad position.  This is where all revolution comes out of the mountains.  It doesn't come from New York.  No.  We're the revolutionaries.  We kick King George's ass.  That, you know. 
[01:58:30]  And you were drunk while you were doing it.  That's a nightmare.  No.  Hey.  You kicked his ass, and then a couple of years later,  won the World Series, and then had a little dry spell.  You're looking at the number three all-time winner against the Yankees all-time.  Yeah.  Number three.  I hear you.  You're number two.  Who's number two?  Babe Ruth.  Oh.  That's exactly right.  Who's number one?  A guy named Dickie Kerr.  Chicago white side.  The Dickie Kerr from Chicago.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Who's Dickie Kerr?  You know Dickie.  Of course.  Why not?  You guys sports guys, or are you just imitating?  No.  Wow.  Heavily.  As a matter of fact, we just had, we're so into sports,  we had the guy that invented the Spalding ball.  He was just on.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Spalding.  His name's Reach.  No, this guy was just Spalding.  Oh, was he?  Yeah.  Well, he stole it.  Oh, he did?  You actually know who makes Spalding balls?  Reach.  Reach did.  Out of Chicopee, Mass.  Jesus.  Wow.  This guy's a heavy, useless information. 
[01:59:30]  Balls were actually stoned by Americans.  Ah.  You know, but no one in this country works anymore,  so we sent him to China.  That's right.  Bunch of lazy shits.  You're right.  Look at them drinking and cavorting and raping in a half hour.  You notice that?  You notice that no one argued?  No, of course they did.  They just raised their beer and said, well, you're right.  Bunch of lazy rapists.  Hear, hear.  Bill Lee. 
[02:00:00]  No, no, no.  Rumor has it Bill Lee used to smoke a little dope before he pitched and stuff.  I don't have to blaspheme to be important.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Not like you.  You're impotent.  Let's ask him.  Ooh.  You're not important.  Wow.  You're going to ask him, Opie?  What do you want?  He's got a question for you.  I heard the rumors over the years.  You used to smoke a little dope before you pitched.  Is it true?  Not only before I pitched.  Oh.  During the game?  Seven-inning stretch?  Why?  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Nothing wrong.  Just want to know the story.  People say that I smoke with George W. Bush. 
[02:00:30]  It is not true.  He smoked with me.  Oh.  Wow.  1972, he was at Harvard.  You know, one of his really great, pushy jobs he had before he became a big pilot.  Out there in Alabama.  What years did he pitch, Opie?  What year did you pitch?  What year did I pitch?  What years?  What years did you pitch?  From 1969 to the present. 
[02:01:00]  You're still on the roster?  Yeah.  I thought.  I won the over 50 world championship last year.  You did?  Yeah.  All right.  Congratulations.  Thank you very much.  Are they going to give you a ring?  I don't want a ring.  You don't want a World Series ring?  I end up giving them to girls in Milwaukee.  I have no idea what that means.  Bill, we have no idea what that is.  Yeah?  Wait.  I can only imagine.  Shannon, you know what he's talking about? 
[02:01:30]  No, but I can imagine.  No.  Nothing at all.  Hey, do you think Pedro is a prima donna?  No.  I think Pedro is a great pitcher.  Because he, Opie's always saying that Pedro is a prima donna and he's overrated.  Opie, Opie, Opie.  My father said I was a prima donna.  It means number one dancer.  That's what that means.  Oh.  All right.  Now I know.  So if you're the number one dancer, you're a prima donna.  What are your feelings about the greatest pitcher of all time, Roger Clemens?  Roger Clemens? 
[02:02:00]  Roger Clemens is the greatest pitcher from the neck down.  Oh.  So he's got a big hog, is what you're saying.  No?  Let's put it this way.  Yeah?  He never won a big game for the Red Sox.  Ah.  He took himself out of the 86 World Series and gave the ball to Chiraldi.  Uh-huh.  Kevin Chiraldi, who you couldn't pull a nail out of his ass with a pair of eight-inch flyers.  And it's probably been tried.  His cheeks were wrapped around that thing like you read about.  Wow.  Never give the ball to Chiraldi. 
[02:02:30]  What was your most exciting moment on the Red Sox?  What was the moment that stands out in your mind as the, you know, the big moment?  The biggest moment.  Yeah.  When I played for the Red Sox, it was probably the 75 World Series.  75 World Series.  Yeah.  I don't think they won that one, did they?  No, we didn't.  But guess what?  Yeah.  What?  In 1923, the Yankees won their first world championship.  And on that team, 81 games were won by Red Sox pitchers. 
[02:03:00]  The 1923 World Series was won by Red Sox.  This guy is a spin doctor, isn't he?  I love him.  Another thing.  Yeah.  Why do all the trees in Kenmore Square point to the South?  Why?  Because New York sucked.  That got the crowd back?  Thank you, sir.  And there he goes.  Bill Lee, everyone.  Bill Lee.  Yeah.  And there goes Jim to get his picture with Bill Lee.  Look at Jim running off to try to get a picture. 
[02:03:30]  Look at this freak, this animal that wants to take a picture with everybody.  Look, sir.  Look at him.  Look at him.  The chase is on.  Jim is running for the first time in his life.  Jim is running up the stairs to get a picture with Bill Lee.  Look at him.  I need my picture.  And there he goes.  There he goes.  Jim just leaves.  People that are here think we're kidding.  Back at the studio, when we say, Jim just left the show to take a picture.  Well, you saw it here live, people.  He is the most irresponsible little shit. 
[02:04:00]  He just left the show.  He stinks.  Yeah.  He just left the show.  Well, that was a surprise little guest that we had there, huh?  Yeah, the spaceman, Bill Lee.  What a kook who loves his pot.  He loves his pot.  Is that his excuse?  That's been the rumor for many, many years.  Yes, sir.  All I want to know is why Bill Lee brought his glove to the game like an 11-year-old literally  baseball player.  Who's shitting who?  He's going to maybe catch a foul ball or something.  And his uniform was from like 1945 or something. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my God.  That was the Bambino's uniform.  It was awful.  The thing was ancient.  We can't hear you, sir.  We can't hear you.  Well, we've got to get back to God's back.  Yeah, sorry.  I don't know who else will pop in, but my God, man.  Well, what do you guys, obviously, you guys got to be working on something.  What are you doing these days?  I hear we pulled you away from maybe a writing session?  Yeah, we're writing the new one.  Writing the new one?  It's got boots.  Yeah?  Feeling confident?  Yeah.  I know. 
[02:05:00]  You guys have had a couple of really big albums, and it's got to be a little rough to  come up with new material and hope it's just as good?  Well, we don't really feel pressure there.  No?  We've been playing for so long, it's just a thing.  Yeah.  We write heavy shit, and that's the way it is.  And it just comes out.  You don't find it harder, each album, to come up with new stuff?  As I always said, a lot of people have a great first album because it's like their life's  work, working up to that point, and then you have a few months or maybe a year to come 
[02:05:30]  out with the next one.  Well, the trick is not to keep writing the same record over and over, you know what  I mean?  Keep it interesting, but not lose the integrity of the song, you know?  You guys have up until now, yeah, done a great job doing that.  I mean, this stuff just fucking rocks.  Oh, Jimmy's back.  Yeah, thank you, Jim.  Jimmy's back from getting his picture with Bill Lee.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  There we go.  You're back.  Did you get your picture, Jimmy?  Are you happy?  Yeah, he was a tough one, man, because he walks really quick. 
[02:06:00]  I actually just got in the back.  I fucking chased him all the way around and got it there.  I know, he was running like he was running the bases or something, wasn't he?  That guy is out of his mind.  Oh, he's nuts.  He is completely nuts.  Nice Boston fans, too.  A Boston legend.  They're all yelling, shit dick.  What a bunch of creeps.  Jesus Christ, you guys are awful.  Yeah, you treat your legends like shit.  I want to talk to him more because supposedly he dropped acid once during a game.  During a game?  Yeah, the guy is just out of his skull, so.  Wow, nice. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  He's still on it.  Yeah, I think I'm just still seeing trails from that one.  Who was the, I guess that was his family with him?  Yeah.  Maybe his parents or something?  Did you see the horrified look on their faces?  Oh, when the crowd started chanting something about rape?  Yeah, that might have done it.  A nice family probably thinking it's going to be a bunch of sportscasters talking about baseball when he walks in.  They have front row seats to us talking about his drug use and maybe having a girl here be accosted. 
[02:07:00]  And they're holding up signs that say shit dick.  Shit dick.  And he thinks he's going on a sports show.  So, yeah, but our old pal Ron Valeri dragged these guys out of the studio.  They were in the middle of writing some new stuff for the new album they're working on.  Now, you guys were touring with Metallica.  We saw that show in New York.  Yes, we did.  Saw the, yeah, saw that.  And then we saw the movie now.  What's it called?  Some kind of monster?  Oh, the Metallica movie?  Yeah, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Did you guys see any little pieces of that going on? 
[02:07:30]  No, they had the drama worked out by the time we hit it.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it surprising to you to see that movie and then go, wow, this shit was going on like right under our nose and you didn't realize like?  Yeah, it was surprising because, you know, we got to see them every day and get friendly.  And then to see them in that situation where they weren't getting along was trippy.  Did you find it like, because as I was watching it, I kind of found it almost like a parody, like a Spinal Tap kind of thing.  Totally.  That here's this hugely successful rock band together for so many years. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, do you guys have any of these personality, not so much glitches or anything, but just maybe great on each other a little bit at times?  Uh-oh, they're laughing and looking at each other.  Well, I know because I've been in bands, you know, my whole life and I just know how it is.  There are some guys that, you know, a little more power than other guys, some guys that lay back and some guys that just bang heads all the time.  And I'm sure your band has that dynamic.  Well, that's what's good with us is because, as you know, Sully is the, you get a little bit of a head problem, you know. 
[02:08:30]  A couple of us are real laid back, so it works out.  We put all the crazy guys on one bus and all the easy guys on the other bus.  In other words, me and Sully are on one bus.  Right, right.  And that was a conscious decision to keep things civil, I guess.  Yeah, it works.  You're more of the laid back, you know, I'm enjoying the ride here.  And then other people are kind of like, you know, they got the power thing, or as I like to call them, Opie.  And some of the laid back guys, me. 
[02:09:00]  We have that same shit happen.  We have separate buses, too.  No, but it's rough.  And I guess the more successful you get and the longer you're together, the more you really have to deal with that because you are successful.  You don't want to blow it up and, you know, end up playing some small venue going, yeah, we used to fill arenas.  After touring for five, six years, you learn pretty quick what to do and what not to do.  You know, that's after about a month of touring, that's your new home.  So you learn to adjust, and everybody learns to see everybody's moods and when out to talk and when to talk. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  Now, how long have you guys been together?  Ten years.  Ten.  Now, can you picture in as many years as Metallica's been together, what, over 20 years?  20 years, yeah.  Can you picture being together as a band and actually still doing this?  Yeah, I can also picture therapy.  Yeah, with a therapist.  Lots of rehab.  Yeah.  That whole thing with the therapist and some kind of monster, that was... 
[02:10:00]  Some guy with a sweater.  That guy was...  And then when they told him that they didn't need him anymore, it looked like the therapist was going to cry.  He was going to cry.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that was his goal, is pretty much get them to the position they don't need him anymore.  Right.  But then you're putting yourself out of work.  And then they finally tell him...  And then they didn't want to let go.  Right.  Yeah, then they finally tell him, yeah, we don't need you anymore, and it looked like he was going to just go off and cry.  So 10,000 a day he's crying about or something.  But you've got to give it to Metallica for actually making the effort to stay together, knowing, you know, hey, we've got something that's huge here. 
[02:10:30]  I'm not sure if it's so much for the art anymore as it is.  And I hate to say, yeah, Metallica's doing it for the cash or anything.  I don't know from a hole in the wall.  But you would think for being together that long, that to have that kind of success has got to be...  You don't want to give it up that quickly, you know.  And they do seem like businessmen, especially Lars seems like the guy that likes those big paintings that he hangs up in his house  and likes the income that comes in.  And I think to hold it together for that, you know, to have to go through therapy and stuff is... 
[02:11:00]  I guess you've got to give a little credit for that.  It's a little odd, though, for a rock band.  You really don't see a rock band acting like that, but 20 years.  Hey, good luck to you.  I hope, you know, I hope you hold it together and don't need therapy.  Tony and Robbie are looking at each other like, dude, you don't even want to know.  Yeah, well, no, I know how guys can be in bands.  I've been in bands, and there's always at least one that's just a fucking asshole. 
[02:11:30]  And you've got to deal with them, you know.  It's like being married, but you can't have sex.  It sucks.  Yeah, all the bullshit and none of the sex.  That's why we try to do drugs.  What's the groupie situation like on the road?  Is it like, I mean, rock band, there's no greater pussy magnets than a rock band.  It's changed a lot, man.  You know, in the 80s, you know, there was no AIDS.  So, like, there was a lot more open sessions.  As far as I'm concerned, there isn't now. 
[02:12:00]  I just plow right ahead.  Speaking of pussy, where is it?  What are you guys doing to us?  I'm not at this event.  This is cock fest.  Yeah, somewhere groupie came up backwards.  Cock fest 2005.  Changed on us, huh?  Our fans.  Actually, we have a couple of very attractive girls in the crowd.  Really?  Where?  They came forward.  Well, we have the girls that were the 22-year-olds from college.  They're still here?  One from college and one's a nurse.  Ooh.  And isn't it great in a room full of people, you can point out the two girls and know exactly 
[02:12:30]  what they did and everything?  That's how limited we are with the girls here.  What?  We got another girl?  Any girls willing to show Godsmack their wonderful breasts?  Yeah.  Where?  Not you, wheelchair Fred.  Jesus.  What?  Yeah, all the guys are pointing.  Look, it looks like there's just throwing up on a pinball machine and fuck her.  Savages.  The one girl, she's crying, crumpled in a ball. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Ooh.  All right, hold on.  We can't hear you.  We can't hear you.  We can't hear you.  Uh, yeah, talking to the mic.  Will I get a MiFi out of the deal?  Ooh.  Damn.  You know, we just Godsmack.  I think I should get one.  A what?  I don't know.  We have a, we have a roadie.  We'll give you a roadie.  It's not a MiFi, but it's a roadie.  It goes in the car.  A MiFi?  We're negotiating right now.  We're negotiating.  I have, I have, I have one.  I have a roadie.  All right.  You get a roadie for the tits and a MiFi for the clit and anus. 
[02:13:30]  Wow.  Really?  Really.  If I get a MiFi, that's all I care about.  That's all you care about?  Okay, let me add to that.  And then you gotta blow me.  Or just applaud while Fred does.  We already made a deal.  I get both for everything, sight-wise.  Jesus.  Wow.  Ass.  They're winking. 
[02:14:00]  Well, you should look behind you.  I was, Ben is panicking.  What's the matter, Ben?  Ben is panicking and jerking.  All right, could you pretend you're Drew Barrymore and kiss him on the cheek?  Well, should we, uh, should we ask Ben or should we ask the crowd?  I say that we ask, let's ask Ben first.  Ben, Ben, come here, Ben.  What do you think, Ben?  About, about her?  She, she wants to show her bosoms for a roadie, too.  I'm actually turned on.  I'm filling up.  And she wants to show her, um.  Clint and anus.  Clint and anus, yes. 
[02:14:30]  It's a black comedy team from the 40s.  Wow.  Ben is sweating.  She's really hot.  Didn't think she'd go for it, did she?  You can't have Godsmack here and then not have any chicks flash.  I know.  It's embarrassing for the show.  We have to.  I think she would have to do it, like, standing right there in the middle of Godsmack.  I only have to go for it for both, though.  I have to get both.  Wow.  She's really hot.  Trying to have a hard bargain.  You're limited with girls. 
[02:15:00]  Are you going to argue?  What are you saving up to be?  Jewish?  I don't know how to say.  Jewish, I'll say.  Ben is freaking out.  Ben has left.  Ben's losing his mind.  Why?  Ben has left the building.  Ben's over there.  Ben's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't do that.  Are you going to be hanging out for a little while?  We have to confer and consult and figure it out.  If you figure it out, I'll do it.  Do a little spin. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, let's see.  Let's see what we're going to look at.  Nice dumper.  Wow.  That's not bad.  It's worth it.  Yeah, she's solid.  Yeah, we've done worse, you know.  That's good.  Will you drop a log on one of my headshots?  Fred, ask Fred.  Put the mic to Fred.  Fred, what do you think about this girl?  Fred.  The look of me darling.  What?  He wants you to look at him.  Fred's not a bad looking guy. 
[02:16:00]  You're a very lovely young lady.  Very lovely young lady, of course.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Hubba, hubba, hubba.  Hubba, hubba.  What the hell year is this, Fred?  Very smooth, Fred.  Hubba, hubba.  Huh?  Hubba, hubba.  That'd be relative if you were in FDR's wheelchair.  Hubba, hubba.  Wooden wheels.  I'm drooling.  You're drooling? 
[02:16:30]  I don't think that has anything to do with the girl.  Unfortunately.  All right, we've got to figure this whole mess out.  We've got to get Godsmack Flash, though.  We have to have a big show.  It's embarrassing if we don't get these guys to rock stars.  All right, yeah, wait, just hang out, enjoy your beverage.  Yeah, keep her to the side.  Miss, by the way, Miss, keep her in the bullpen.  Ask her how old she is.  How old are you, young lady?  23.  23.  Do you have a fella?  Huh?  Do you have a fella? 
[02:17:00]  Do I have a what?  A fellow.  A boyfriend.  Do you have a boyfriend?  He's here waiting.  Is he true?  Waiting for the show.  Really?  By the way, you are at the beginnings of Jim trying to pick you up line, in case no one's  noticed.  Him asking you that might mean you will be on line.  Oh, Jimmy likes that.  I like it at the certain limits.  Like, your boyfriend wouldn't want to get involved with me.  Hey, Jimmy, it's about time you showed up.  You're probably two and a half hours into the show. 
[02:17:30]  I've been involved with him.  Wait, sir?  Go to Jimmy, it's about time you showed up two and a half hours into the show.  This guy is a prick, and I love him.  And he's getting drunker and drunker as we go here.  He's yelling shit dick at Billy.  What a creep.  He really is.  Why, you and your boyfriend do things in front of other people?  Maybe we could.  Maybe you could?  Have you in the past?  All right, where's the boyfriend?  Have you in the past?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Wait, where's the boyfriend?  Like, wouldn't it be bad if you two did that?  All right, get that tool up here.  Yeah, bring him up here.  All right, get the boyfriend up here. 
[02:18:00]  He's probably strapping with broad shoulders.  Get the boyfriend up here.  You guys, are you guys bored?  No.  You guys all right with this?  This is cool.  No, by the way, that's the difference between rock star and radio people.  The rock stars get laid, and we get, oh, here's my boyfriend.  Come up and say hi.  Sign a wow statement and then jerk off in the back room alone.  Wow, you're, uh, you're, uh, you're, uh, fucking her.  There you go.  Oh, nice.  All right, dude.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's get into it.  So, would you invite Jim back to your pad? 
[02:18:30]  We live really far.  Well, how about, my hotel's not far.  I don't want to touch anybody.  I just want to whack my bag and watch.  So, nice.  Yeah, Jim can come back.  Nice.  So, he would, no, here's the deal.  He would jack it as you two go at it.  Yeah.  He would watch.  In Jim's hotel room, which is very close to you.  Do we have to put an ad on Craigslist first?  Yeah, it would actually make me feel more comfortable if you just showed up and pretended you didn't  know me and then just spit on me.  You guys go back to Jim's place.  It's close to here.  You guys just go at it and you're just going to whack your bag?  Yeah, I've watched couples before.  It's fine. 
[02:19:00]  As long as, I don't, I just don't want the, I've had threesomes too.  I just don't want the guy touching me because then I come too quick.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  LOL.  Wow.  So, do we have a love match here?  Yeah, I think we have a love connection.  LOL.  Wow.  That would be worth the my-fi.  You just tell us what happened tomorrow.  Yeah, of course.  What, Donkey Sausage wants to go back too?  We already made a deal. 
[02:19:30]  I like her.  We can't break the deal.  Alright, so you guys are going to go home with Jim after the show.  Do you have tickets to the game?  You guys got tickets to the game?  Tickets to the game?  Nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  Oh, no, don't worry, we weren't going to give you any.  Yeah.  Ben had some, but apparently he had so many friends he just tossed them out.  Alright, well, we got it, we're going to negotiate this.  Negotiate something and perhaps we'll get an update on the lovely couple in you tomorrow.  Yeah, here's my impression of the update. 
[02:20:00]  It was really cool.  They didn't show up, so I just jerked off to the photos that Sex Bagel took of them talking.  You guys know Jimmy's serious.  Maybe we're serious.  Maybe.  You go back to his room.  The game will be on.  You do what you have to do.  He'll do what he has to do.  And then we'll have a great-  As long as the game's on, right.  And then we'll have a great story for the show.  I don't want to get involved.  I don't want to touch them.  You know, I'm not into-  No, you just jack it.  You just want to watch, right?  Yeah, I just want to jack it.  And maybe if I cry and go, you're so lucky, sir.  Don't let that kill the moon. 
[02:20:30]  It's just my low self-esteem.  Imagine you're going at it and then just looking over and seeing Jimmy there and their  old red face.  Especially since I got to play with my nipples to stay hard.  Fucking awful.  Believe me, I am.  A Petri dish of cancer would be more conducive with a sexual  evil moon than me jerking off on old shades.  All right.  Well, we got that going on as well.  All right.  We'll see.  He's serious though.  Stick around.  Who said we weren't?  We don't do fake radio bullshit.  I mean, he'll see when we go to commercial. 
[02:21:00]  He'll start negotiating working this out.  Do we look not serious?  All right.  No.  She said maybe a lot.  Well, let's talk to the guy.  Yeah.  He's involved with it too.  Yeah, dude.  What's his name?  What's his name?  Vic Morrow hat.  What's your name, bro?  Sean.  Sean.  Are you willing to bang your chick in front of Jimmy?  Absolutely.  Just for Jimmy though.  Yeah.  Just for please.  Oh, of course.  Well, I guess deal's a deal.  Wow.  We'll have an update at Paradise tomorrow when we're doing the show for the Paradise.  Yes, we will. 
[02:21:30]  We're doing the show for the Paradise.  Yes, we will.  You've got to bring the MiFi with you though, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  I'll put it in my hiney.  After you guys are done, you can pull it out.  You can just yank it out when I come.  All right.  Good.  What kind of hairstyle do you sport down there?  Oh, it's non-existent.  Ooh.  A wood floor.  I like that.  Should we take a look?  I'm a natural redhead, but you would never know.  Or as we like to call it, the JonBenet Ramsey.  Yeah.  So sexy.  Oh, yeah.  The other one was the Connor's armpit. 
[02:22:00]  Yes.  Little Connor Peterson's armpit.  Hey, could you at least flash Godsmack?  You've got to flash Godsmack.  You've got to flash Godsmack.  You've got to flash Godsmack.  Yeah.  That's fair.  On stage.  On stage.  Yeah, but it's got to be like so everyone...  There you go.  The boys have to see it though.  Ooh.  Wow.  Lovely.  Nice.  Those are lovely.  Slow the ground.  Do a quick spin.  Slow the ground.  A quick spin.  A quick spin.  A quick spin.  A quick spin.  A quick spin. 
[02:22:30]  They love you.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  We've got to see...  Oh, there she goes.  Now, you've got to get on stage.  Get on stage.  Yeah, get up and do it quick.  You've got to get on stage.  You've got to be a good sport.  Ladies and gentlemen, here's a photo op.  Yeah.  Here's a photo op.  Wow.  That's your photo op moment.  Bill Lee gets shit dick and that gets a round of applause.  Yes.  Right outside Fenway.  All right.  Very nice.  That was lovely.  She's hot.  We've got to take a break. 
[02:23:00]  I've got to whiz again.  Yeah, I've got to whiz.  Yeah.  Are you going to whiz?  A little, so it's impressive.  Ugh.  I'm packing a half right now.  Shannon, you guys hanging or...?  You guys are hanging, right?  Yeah, we're hanging or do you guys have to leave?  No, no.  Robbie, Tony, you guys hang a little bit?  Hang out.  Have another beer or something?  Okay, cool.  Yeah, boys.  All right, cool.  You guys, let's hear from Godsmack stopping by.  They're going to hang out with us today.  It's the Open Anthony program live from Bill's Bar.  We'll continue in just a bit.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, what's up, Paul?  Hey, guys, I don't mean to interrupt you.  I wasn't drunk.  You can't get drunk over coffee, orange juice, eggs, bacon.  I didn't say you were drunk.  Who said drunk?  Eric said you were drunk.  Eric!  I would never accuse Master Poe of being drunk when he was in the street.  He sounded like a complete asshole.  O&A Party Rock!  O&A Party Rock!  That is a great clip.  O&A Party Rock!  What the hell is O&A Party Rock?  All right, well, fine.  I was enjoying myself.  I was told to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time. 
[02:24:00]  That's exactly what I was doing.  High on life, not alcohol.  You didn't hear the clip because you could have a cigarette on them.  O&A Party Rock!  Yeah, that's a good one.  But you know what I noticed?  You've got to admit, it sounds a little, you know.  Four days.  O&A Party Rock!  Four days, I lost my voice and I couldn't really talk.  And I was told to go down and hand out stickers.  Club Soda Kenny told me to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time. 
[02:24:30]  And that's exactly what I did.  O&A Party Rock!  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what O&A Party Rock means.  All right, well, whatever.  I do notice that...  We did all acknowledge how you did a great job down there, though.  You handed out thousands and thousands of wow stickers for us.  Thank you.  And cups and all, but he was getting on this microphone that another club had in the middle  of thousands of people on the street and this is what he was coming up with.  O&A Party Rock!  O&A Party Rock!  No, no, come on.  That's an attention getter. 
[02:25:00]  That's the only thing.  That's not the only thing I'd say.  All right, so you want to go on record and say that when you did this...  O&A Party Rock!  You weren't drunk.  No, I wasn't drunk.  That clip gets funnier and funnier, man.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Master Paul.  So you left here yesterday and what happened?  Traffic.  Were you doing heroin with Master Paul?  No, I...  Oh my God.  Guys, what are you doing to me?  I was kind of...  I don't take drugs.  I don't do any of that stuff. 
[02:25:30]  That's a little play on the lap.  Yeah, no, I understand.  It was kind of a sarcastic statement about Eric's exaggeration.  Yeah, Paul, there was a lot of sarcasm in that statement.  Okay.  About Eric's...  You point to Eric, Jimmy.  You try to pawn it off on Eric.  There was a little play on what Eric said.  Remember when he called you drunk?  I know, Paul was the only kid.  He just does so much coke in the morning.  He comes in and he goes all...  Well, according to Eric.  According to Eric.  According to Eric.  Oh my God, you are dead.  You're dead.  You're a dead man.  Eric, tell everyone what you were telling us in the office.  Yeah, what we thought about.  Where you saw him in the stall. 
[02:26:00]  Doing what?  Uh-oh.  Bent over the stall.  Doing something.  No?  Oh boy.  He doesn't want to share on the air.  You're asking for it.  He's scared for his life.  I don't blame him, you know.  Neither do I.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  I'm from Boston.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's showtime, folks.  Turn it on and watch a show.  You're gonna be made fun of.  Uh, alright.  Man, those guys are really cards.  Why don't you shove it out your ass? 
[02:26:30]  D.O.B. and Anthony Show.  I am alone.  Everything that I believe is fading.  I am alone.  Inside I am alone.  And we're back.  Live from Boston at Bill's Bar at the Open Anthony program. 
[02:27:00]  Speaking of stand-alone, we've got Gotswack on the stage with us.  We haven't really talked to him much yet.  Things keep happening.  The Space Lee thing.  Space man Bill Lee.  And now negotiating like some action for Norton later tonight.  Some type of sex.  Only going on for a MiFi.  Yeah.  That'll be a good story tomorrow, so.  Yeah, I'm sure fucking Eric Logan's happy.  Our first day off the premium.  Alright, you two fuck, and I'll give you a unit.  Don't forget to take some pictures. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  If he'll allow it, I'll certainly take pictures.  He didn't show you the pictures on his camera?  I haven't seen them.  He's got hundreds of good ones.  I got to go on a porno casting call when I was in L.A.  with two of my friends who were directors, and it was great.  I didn't get blown or anything, though.  It kind of sucked.  I just kind of sat there looking at naked girls, and then left, and then strangled someone.  Hey, you guys played for the troops, didn't you?  Yeah.  Camp Pendleton.  Last week you did?  Yeah.  It was awesome. 
[02:28:00]  We played.  The best thing was, man, we were Ted Nugent's backup band.  We played five songs, and Ted Nugent came out.  We played Cat Scratch, Fever, Strangle.  Really?  Behind Nugent.  How cool was that?  And he said at the end of it, after we talked to him after the show, he's like, so my lead was perfect, right?  Yeah.  That's Ted.  That's right.  Sometimes you just want to tell Ted, shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  You know?  You want to just wrap him in the head.  We get it, Ted.  But he's a funny dude.  He's a funny dude.  Yeah, definitely.  We've had him on the show many times. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  No, we love having him on, but sometimes you've got to smack him in the head.  It's like, all right, Uncle Ted, we understand.  I talk a lot of shit when he leaves.  He's like, when he's there, I'm like, yeah, no, good point.  But then he's like, what a fucking idiot he was, right?  You never say it when he's right there, because, you know, he has a big outdoorsy motherfucker.  He'll shoot you.  Yeah.  Put an arrow through your head or something.  He's just too sticky.  All right, thank you very much.  Uncle Uncle Ted beans are all right.  We get it.  We know.  He's a bright guy.  Shut the fuck up.  Right.  Oh, you're an American.  So, yeah, very good, Jim. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Playing for the troops, though, in Camp Pendleton.  Yeah.  You know, you guys didn't go over to Iraq.  Jimmy went to Iraq.  Yeah.  He actually went there.  Yeah.  What a nut.  These guys are doing much too well to put themselves in danger.  I notice everybody that goes over to Iraq is just kind of like, eh, we're all finished.  Colin and me and fucking Fat Bob Kelly just went.  Yeah.  Ted said he went over there to Iraq, Afghanistan, or whatever, and, you know, he packed a gun,  of course. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, Ted was packing?  And they told him he couldn't bring his gun.  Really?  It's like, that's like going swimming without getting wet.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Why couldn't he bring his gun?  Jesus.  I would want Ted to have a gun there, you know?  Yeah.  Probably pop a few.  I don't know.  I think Ted's great with a fucking deer peeking at him, but I'd like to see how he  does with eight uncircumcised insurgents fucking lobbing a mortar at him.  Ted's really good in fucking Wisconsin with some horned asshole animal just going peekaboo,  peekaboo, but some fucking savage babbling in a native tongue. 
[02:30:00]  I don't think Ted would do too well.  I'd like to see him give it a try.  You know, that's a good point.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Ted's not a soldier.  He's a fucking rock star who fingered Courtney Love when she was eight.  I gotta respect that.  He never fessed up to that.  I know he didn't, but I'm hoping it's true.  Did he tell you that story?  Did he read that story, Courtney Love, when she was, what was it, 11 or something?  Yeah, something like...  Yeah, something like...  I think 12.  It was really some ridiculously...  We'll try to get it out of him, but...  It was ridiculous.  He put on great balls of fire and just jammed two fingers. 
[02:30:30]  That's a good Jerry Lee Lewis reference to nothing.  Sorry.  That's why she likes the two fingers, huh?  Yeah, she was young then.  You know what it was going to.  The time she met Kurt, it was up to the elbow.  While holding a...  Oh, oh, oh.  This is interesting.  I'm actually getting instant feedback from somebody in the room.  Somebody's actually instant feedbacking from their mobile device in the room.  And I would love to point him out.  I don't know who he is because he's goofing on the two security guys at the door. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  What's wrong with them?  He's saying that they're standing there trying to look tough, yet they look so gay.  Is what the guy is pointing out.  He goes, I'm in the crowd.  They don't look gay at all.  From mobile device, in the crowd.  Yeah, in the crowd.  So, whoever that is, why don't you be brave and raise your hand.  Yeah.  Come on, brave guy.  Who are ya?  That's a chick. 
[02:31:30]  That guy on the end over there, not closer to me, don't fuck with him.  Don't fuck with him.  You were great and rebel without a cause.  I don't give a shit what they say.  You're a bunch of smart asses, man.  I know.  Talk shit from the audience and don't acknowledge it.  It is kind of creepy, though.  Right when I started reading it, he goes, I'm in the crowd.  The bouncers by the door to your right.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  Little laser pointer sight on my head.  I'm pointing a gun at you. 
[02:32:00]  We've traced that phone call.  It's coming from inside the house.  He knows you're alone.  He fucking murdered the children upstairs.  That was very creepy.  Sitting in a bloody bedroom making prank calls.  It's like terrorizing telemarketers with pedophilia and rape involved.  Come on.  You know it was me.  That was a creepy ass movie, man.  Oh, yeah.  I gotta say, too.  I got to smack.  I saw you guys.  The first time I saw you guys live, because me and dumb Jim Florentine fucking missed Nassau  Coliseum.  We walked in.  We were 40 minutes late. 
[02:32:30]  They were singing like stand alone.  I'm like.  Oh, yeah.  You guys missed it.  And I'm not bullshitting the best live performance I've ever seen.  It was by you guys opening for Metallica.  Unbelievable.  From the metal end.  Yep.  I was blown away.  I didn't have any-  The only drum solo I've been able to stomach since like the 70s.  Is that sick or what?  That is just unheard of.  The drum solo you guys came up with is just insane.  Thank you.  Because drum solo is usually, you know, no offense, it's the time to go get a drink.  They're boring. 
[02:33:00]  They've just over the years, it's like, all right, you know, the last one you might sit  and watch was John Bonham or something, you know?  Or Rick Allen.  Yeah, and then you just-  You're awful, man.  And then it just kind of got, you know, all right, here he goes.  They'll flip him in the air or do something.  And Tommy Lee, you know, he's flying over the crowd or something.  But, you know, you guys add a whole thing into it, you know?  There's two drummers going at it.  You know, there's music to it. 
[02:33:30]  I like it.  We keep the band up there.  Right, right.  The band doesn't go away.  Right.  Why is it-  Why did-  Why did somebody in the middle of the Godsmack chat hand me a picture of Billy Crystal?  That was club sort of Kenny.  Kenny, why?  Kenny, why did-  Why did you just hand a picture of Billy Crystal up to Lil Jimmy Norton?  I thought he would like it.  You are a moron!  That's no sneaker.  Sneaker?  That's no sneaker? 
[02:34:00]  That's no sneaker-t.  Secret.  Oh!  Boy, are you really-  You're really off today.  You're right.  Yeah, everyone wants to see you skip, but I don't think that's going to happen.  There's no room.  Not through this crowd.  Unless, maybe if they part.  If the crowd parts.  Do you think that could be-  We could actually, like, Moses-  All right, if we could get, like-  You guys, we need a path to the doorway.  Parts the crowd right there.  Let's see.  All right, part-  Make enough room for big, stupid Kenny to skip. 
[02:34:30]  All right, this is a photo op.  A six-foot-seven animal skipper.  Here he goes.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Skip.  There he goes.  Wow, look at the cameras going off.  Wow.  They love it.  It's a media event.  It gets better.  It gets better.  He skips back.  He's coming back.  No bullshit.  He skips back.  Uh-oh, some people are in his line of fire.  And he just pushes him out of the way.  The big goon that he is.  Yes, this is a nationally syndicated talk show, yes.  Right. 
[02:35:00]  And this is what we do.  Nothing.  And that's the highlight of our show, is a large man skipping through the crowd.  Yeah, they're not onto us yet, thank God.  He's big and stupid, and he shows it on a daily basis.  All right.  Well, we've got to get these guys back to the studio.  Writing material for your album.  Go write some more songs.  What are we looking at the new CD?  Do you guys have any idea yet, or not sure?  It's looking like November, probably.  You know?  We're taking our time, but November.  Unless there's therapy, and Sully has to go into rehab or something, sure.  I've got to tell you guys, I love the acoustic album, by the way. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, thanks, man.  I absolutely love that.  Well, the new one's not going to be that.  No, I know.  It's not going to be balls.  You guys are going to go right back to rocking again.  But it was a nice little break in the accent, the acoustic.  Yeah, and I liked it a lot.  What?  Any more Navy ads in the future?  That was the coolest thing.  Did they?  Yeah.  That's like the coolest thing.  All of a sudden, you're hearing Godsmack and watching some guy swab a dick.  How cool was it being in this show?  That sounds interesting.  Three more years? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  What was that?  I think they're going to pick a different song.  Yeah.  What was the movie with the rock that you guys stand alone was the song for?  The Scorpion King, right?  We just met that girl, Kelly, at that Camp Pendleton.  Kelly?  Which one's Kelly?  The chick, Kelly, from Scorpion King.  How are you?  Scorpion King.  Oh, I didn't see it.  Oh, she's just this amazing girl.  Yeah.  Was she hot?  Yeah, she was hot.  Of course.  She just attacked her.  Alyssa Milano was in the house.  Ooh.  I met Cindy Crawford.  Who? 
[02:36:30]  Cindy Crawford?  Cindy Crawford's looking kind of thin.  Well, Alyssa.  Is she?  Looking kind of worse.  Yeah, I met her once.  She's no kid anymore.  But that Alyssa Milano, how is that, right?  Oh, my God.  Isn't that just fantastic?  Oh, my God.  The cleavage was showing.  I met her once with Ozzy.  I would have stepped over her body to fucking jack Ozzy off.  And her fucking arms were hairy.  That's what I remember.  Her arms were...  Was it MTV?  Yeah, that's right.  You know what that means, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of big push down there.  Awful.  That's cottage roof.  What's Ozzy got to do with Alyssa? 
[02:37:00]  He's in love with Ozzy.  No, they were in the same...  They were doing an MTV event, and they were in the same, like, area.  And I was trying to get to meet Ozzy and fucking, you know, something like Alyssa Milano.  He didn't care.  He just wants to see Ozzy.  Yeah, I shook her paw and then walked my arm.  Shame on you.  Her paw.  Her wookiee arm.  Yeah, it was awful.  Nice hairy, huh?  Yeah, it was awful.  Probably got that strip of hair that goes all the way around to the rear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it time to get shit caught in it, like, for a week?  Oh, God.  What?  That's hot talk.  It certainly is. 
[02:37:30]  All right, you guys, let's hear it for Godsmack.  Round of applause for Godsmack, man.  Tony, Robbie, and Shannon from Godsmack helping us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, guys.  We should probably take another break and regroup.  We went late.  Whoa.  Ow.  So, we'll be back from Bill's Bar.  It's the Opian Anthony program.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  You think you can handle a cinnamon roll?  Sure.  I don't know where the other guy gets them, whatever his name is. 
[02:38:00]  Well, can he get...  What's his name?  Danny?  Can he get an egg white sandwich at the same place that has the cinnamon rolls?  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Oh, my God.  You're sending him out for something else?  I'm hungry today.  And I need some fat-free milk and a...  Oh, my God.  And a spoon.  He pulls out his little Columbo pad.  He's got down his notes on.  Oh, we got it.  A cinnamon roll.  Dude, this is a whole...  This is a whole process. 
[02:38:30]  Can't we do it during the break?  Yeah.  This is not just a quick food order.  We have to explain in detail.  What?  A cinnamon roll is easy.  What do you want?  Oh, boy.  Jim has absolutely no confidence in Ricky.  No.  Jim comes in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, I need coffee.  I'm like, oh, Ricky Gifford.  He's like, absolutely not.  Where's Danny?  Takes Danny right off the phones.  Danny's answering the phones.  No.  Go.  Well, I think Rick...  I want some skim milk and a banana.  Skim milk and a banana.  And a spoon.  And where do we get egg whites?  On, like, a bagel.  On a good bagel? 
[02:39:00]  On a good bagel?  Yeah.  Like an everything bagel?  Mm-hmm.  Don't deal with that place downstairs.  They're foods.  Egg whites.  Egg whites.  Now, here's...  After you have that written down, here's the issue with my cinnamon roll.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I don't know where these places are that these people get these cinnamon rolls.  I don't know where they are.  But one that I get sometimes, it's hard and nasty.  We don't want the hard, nasty, old, stale ones. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, right there.  I like a cushy, fresh cinnamon roll that's spongy.  Just give it a little squeeze when you...  Not with your fingers.  You want the cinnamon roll...  You can tell by looking at it.  You want the cinnamon roll to feel like 18-year-old boobs.  Yes.  You don't want it to feel like breast implants.  You don't have to look at it.  You can tell by looking at dog crap on the street.  If it's old and dry and flaky.  Or if it's nice, cushy and soft. 
[02:40:00]  Give it a little poke.  Now, that doesn't mean bring back dog crap, either.  It might do that.  You're a crazy person.  No, I won't.  Just poke it.  Don't poke it, Jimmy.  Shut up about fucking poking.  He has to.  You put his nail into your apple and you lost your mind, you lunatic.  I'm with Jimmy.  I think you need to take your index finger and give it just a little...  No, there's no poking my cinnamon roll.  Just a little poke.  Watch your hands first.  No.  Watch your hands.  Just a little poke.  A poke where Anthony wouldn't even know that you actually poked it. 
[02:40:30]  You mother fucker.  No.  No.  Just a little like this.  Look.  Just a little.  Just like that.  No.  Don't be poking.  Just to see if it kind of pushes in a little bit and then comes right back out.  Alright, Ricky.  Get out of here.  O.B. and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  Live from Boston.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh my.  How ruthlessly absurd.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh my God. 
[02:41:00]  One more time.  We can destroy.  We're back at Phil's Bar and Bosses, the Opie and Anthony program, hanging with some friends. 
[02:41:30]  We've got a lot of new people listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  Don't worry, it gets a lot better than this.  Hell, I like it.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  Yeah, for the new listeners, hang in there.  It gets better than this.  Oh, God, imagine this is someone's first show ever.  Like, what the fuck is the big deal with these guys?  I listen to this crap every day.  Yeah, they just yell shit deck a lot.  Yes, they do. 
[02:42:00]  And then we're doing it tomorrow at the Paradise.  We're going 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. tomorrow morning.  And then we'll be back in New York doing a real radio show Wednesday, I guess.  Yeah, because we'd love to touch on some of the subjects that came up over vacation.  But it's kind of hard in this atmosphere, as you can see.  I'd like to talk about my vacation a little.  I'll throw a little tidbit out there.  The first day of my cruise, my cruise on Royal Caribbean, down into the Caribbean, I'm sitting at dinner, the big dining hall. 
[02:42:30]  And the maitre d' walks up to me and says, I would like to extend an invitation to you to dine at the captain's table tomorrow evening.  Why you?  I have no fucking idea.  But for some reason, I was invited.  And the next day, I dined at the captain's table with the captain of the ship.  And Captain Stewie? 
[02:43:00]  No, it wasn't Captain Stewie.  It was some foreigner guy, you know.  Was it Ed Asner from Roots?  No.  Yeah.  No, not that captain either.  But, yeah, it was very interesting when the conversation got around to, so what do you do?  A little hard to describe my job and what I've done.  Did you describe it?  And did they know?  Yeah, a little bit.  We'll touch on that a little later, though, I think, you know, in the week.  Yeah.  Because it's kind of hard.  We've got these boss people.  Shit dick! 
[02:43:30]  All they want to do is start chants and yell shit dick.  And maybe Wednesday I can get into what happened in L.A.  and I can explain when the girl took my face picture while I jerked off all over myself.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not.  You did that.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Why?  Why the face picture?  Because she does that.  She takes pictures of people's face while they masturbate.  She doesn't want to see your mule.  And so I said, well, I'll do that because I just wanted to jerk off in front of somebody.  And I did.  What situation? 
[02:44:00]  I had with my camera.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  What situation were you in that that actually comes up?  Maybe it was somebody that's been on this radio program and we happened to connect in L.A.  E.L.O.  No?  Well, he asked me once to do that.  Wow.  Yeah, and I'll tell you about that.  That's a little teaser from Wednesday.  A little tease.  I want to hear that story myself.  Yeah, it's a good one.  So did Dice ask about us?  Oh.  I didn't see Andrew when I was out there.  I did not see him. 
[02:44:30]  No?  Any other celebrity?  Any celebrity sightings out there at HBO?  Yeah, I went backstage to Motorhead, so I got some really good fucking pictures.  I annoyed Rodney James Dio for a shot.  He's 4'7".  Yeah, it was great.  Yeah, he's a little guy.  And I finally got David Keith, the guy who I thought was Patrick Swayze the first time  I was out.  You pissed him off because you went up to him and went, Patrick?  I'm not Patrick.  I'm like, come on, man.  I'm a comic.  Take a picture.  And then he walked away and I realized, oh, it's fucking David Keith.  No wonder he's annoyed.  So I got him.  It was fun.  It was a good trip.  And he didn't recognize you from the last faux pas? 
[02:45:00]  No, please.  He just kind of kept his head down the first time and walked away.  Yeah.  But he's like, I never refuse a picture.  I'm like, oh, thanks, man.  Unless some asshole calls me something different.  Yeah, unless some jerk-off thinks he's a much bigger celebrity.  So did that couple leave or they go?  Oh, they're in the back.  They're actually from, I think, hey, a nice couple in the back.  Hey, Aaron and, uh, so, wait, I'm asking him a question.  Are you guys from Philly, right?  Okay, yeah, they're actually from Philadelphia, so.  And they're going to go back to your room with you?  I don't know.  They're definitely coming to the Bregada next week.  Oh. 
[02:45:30]  Wait, now what's happening?  Yes, we always stash a few backstage.  Never know.  You never know when you might need a blonde.  Show your dick!  Show your dick!  Oh, boy.  What a surprising chant.  Yeah.  I never would have expected that from this crowd.  I thought they were going to chant, show your intelligence, myself.  No, I figured they would just rush the stage and rip their clothes off, you savages.  Oh, this is the nurse and the college student back on stage, right?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[02:46:00]  What happened to, uh...  The nurse.  The, uh, what?  The nurse is not up here.  No, the nurse isn't up here.  This is college student and girl who would let Jimmy watch her get banged by her boyfriend.  Yeah.  Which is going to happen after the show.  I guarantee it now.  All right, so what are they doing, Eric?  Let's turn our mic on, sweetie pie.  Hawk?  Hawk, get on that.  The college student right here wants to do a lap dance for Fred or for the other gentleman. 
[02:46:30]  Nice.  Oh, wow.  It'd have to be Fred.  Yeah, Fred.  Yeah.  Let's wheel, uh, wheelchair Fred.  Can we get him on stage so everyone can see this?  Are you kidding?  I don't think there's enough room.  Yeah, we could put him on stage and then I want to play Achille Lauro and push him off.  That's us making that, right?  Can we get him on the side stage?  If we're going to do this, the crowd's going to have to, uh, want the crowd to see this.  Yeah.  And what about poor, uh, wheelchair Lawrence?  No, no.  His taker's going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:47:00]  All right, we're going to lift wheelchair Fred up onto the stage here.  Well, why don't you lift him over here?  What are you going to do?  Drag him over there?  Wheel him here, and then lift him.  There's more room in the corner.  Oh, there's more room over there?  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Once again, wheelchair Fred on stage.  Flying wheelchair.  I like that.  Uh-oh.  He's going to capsize.  Jesus.  Oh.  That's good.  He's already teetering.  He's already teetering.  No good is going to come of this.  Now, there's going to be a problem here.  We are going to be shown to the Connecticut border once again and told never to return. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We got wheelchair Fred on stage.  Another photo op.  The girls are going to lap dance for Fred.  How you doing, Fred?  Yeah.  Another hot chick.  Wow.  Hey, nurse, get up here.  Come on.  Come on up here, nurse.  Come on.  All right.  The nurse is making her way up on stage.  In the sexy voice to boot.  Yeah.  Hey, can you give Opie an enema?  Wow.  All right.  That's great. 
[02:48:00]  Show your take.  Huh.  What are they saying?  I'm not sure.  I can barely even understand it.  Show your IQ.  What?  That's amazing.  Oh, a little camera's going off.  Actually, this girl in front wants to show her boobs right here.  Oh.  She's very sexy, this girl.  Yes.  Very sexy.  She just wants to show the crowd her boobs.  Does she?  A Latino woman.  Very pretty.  Yeah.  A lovely girl.  She just wants the autographed Opie and Anthony poster, and she'll flash for it, I know.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Whoa, hey.  Flash.  Oh, Jesus.  Watch that feedback. 
[02:48:30]  What's your name?  Renan.  What?  Yeah.  Medallia.  Medallia?  What do you do, Medallia?  Nothing.  Nothing?  She does nothing.  I like that.  All right.  She's honestly.  Well, the guys are ready with their cameras.  If you turn around, you can see, like, two, three hundred guys all with their cameras  in the air.  So, you want to flash for the poster board or something, you said?  Yeah.  Is that what's going on here?  Yeah?  Wait.  Wait.  Who are you?  Uh-oh.  We were like.  What?  You don't know if you've got a MiFi, so the other thing. 
[02:49:00]  Wait.  Hold on.  Adolf Caesar wants to know if you're getting a.  Look at AKG.  I'm not listening to Howard.  I'm listening to ONA.  All right.  You're listening to us.  What do you want?  You got a MiFi?  No.  Uh-oh.  The MiFi is going to be given away to the couple that has sex in front of Jim Norton  after the show.  Yeah.  That's, like, the big.  That's the big one.  That trumps your chick's boobs.  And then the real challenge is to use the MiFi with my load all over it. 
[02:49:30]  We love Norton.  We'll settle for the poster board signings.  All right.  We got to sign for you.  All right.  We signed this stupid poster.  Let's see you girls can't.  All right.  Wait.  Yeah, start this way.  We'll be nice.  And then do a spin.  That would be lovely.  Yeah, start in this direction.  Yeah, flash in this way.  Because we have to see if it's good enough for the crowd.  Exactly.  It will be.  All right.  Right?  Okay.  Wow.  They're lovely.  Jesus. 
[02:50:00]  Guys, I know she has no teeth.  I was trying to be cool about it.  Jesus.  Well, they're yelling at me to acknowledge that.  Go ahead.  And then spin.  Very nice.  Now, she's very sexy.  Oh.  On one planet.  What a disaster.  Oh, go ahead.  Flash her.  Go ahead.  What's that?  It might work.  Very nice.  She has lovely breasts.  No.  Very nice.  Tiffany.  Oh, there's another gal coming. 
[02:50:30]  Wait.  What's wrong with this guy?  Hello, miss.  How are you?  What's wrong, buddy?  Hi, miss.  What are you doing?  Watch out.  Watch out.  Watch out.  All right.  I guess this is part of the show where girls are in the puppet style.  Hi.  How are you?  Wow, wee.  Those are lovely.  Wow.  Eric, who's she?  Kevin.  Who are you?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Very nice.  What's your name?  Jennifer.  Wow, wee.  Yeah.  Guys like that one a little better, I think. 
[02:51:00]  That's nice.  Those are nice.  Yeah, you can take a t-shirt.  What?  We'll sign the shirt after.  We'll sign everything after the show.  We'll still be here a while.  Yeah, we'll be here for a while signing.  It doesn't look like it, but we're still broadcasting and doing a radio show.  Believe it or not.  Nice.  Very nice.  There you go.  Can I sign it with clear stuff?  Invisible ink.  Help that girl down.  That's good.  Wow, this is turning into a fine radio program.  It certainly is.  For us.  That's about it.  Believe me. 
[02:51:30]  There's a bunch of listeners just clicking a 203.  I'm hoping there's something on 203.  What is 203?  All right.  What else we got going on here?  We understand this is brutal.  Believe me.  We know it.  Yes, sir.  Oh, yeah.  Fred.  Oh, yeah.  Fred is over there in the corner looking like he does.  Fred is just...  Oh, no, Fred.  Fred, don't grab the girl's ass.  Don't touch the girl.  Jesus.  He started diddling her.  All right.  So what's going on here?  Are we going to get the girls to lap dance wheelchair, Fred? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You girls know how to do it.  You girls know how to do a lap dance?  Are you going to get the girls with the big titties?  You figure you can do it?  Yeah, you'll figure it out.  Most girls can.  They know what a lap dance is all about.  And Fred is all lap all the time.  That lap never goes away.  I know.  Hey, Fred, you ready for your lap dance?  Give those girls high girls.  What?  Weezy girls.  Naked girls? 
[02:52:30]  Flash.  Flash.  Come on, baby.  Jesus.  Show me your stuff.  I want that dirt.  The girls are horrified.  The dirt lights by fire.  Way to not look anxious.  Christ.  Good poker face.  I want that dirt.  Well, let's go back to the girls.  Come on, baby.  Let's play the lap fire.  The girls look like when they made the hooker kiss the elephant man, then face you. 
[02:53:00]  Come on, baby.  You dirty.  We got wheelchair Fred way over here, and the girls way over there.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if we're going to be able to get this done.  Yeah, they are on the opposite side of the page.  One girl can probably go over there and do it.  Ladies, would you like to give a lap dance to Fred?  You'll have your clothes on.  Oh, solid.  Wow.  There's no enthusiasm over there, Anthony, whatsoever.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Yeah!  All right.  One girl is going over to wheelchair Fred.  Oh, she's solid. 
[02:53:30]  Look at those cheeks.  Eric.  You got to put some music on.  All right.  Can we get some music on somehow?  Anybody have any music?  Steve's got music that he could crank up for us?  Yeah.  All right, Steve, hit that music.  Oh, yeah.  This is good stripper music.  Not this kind of music.  Wow.  All the music here and all the strip clubs.  All right, turn it down.  I'm not dancing to this country.  What do you want?  What do you want?  She's fucking Paula Picky.  You're giving a lap dance for a quadruplefic.  Some kind of rap or something. 
[02:54:00]  Stripper diva.  What do you want?  Some kind of rap or something.  Oh, some kind of rap.  J-Lo or 50 Cent.  All right, put on Jenny from the Block.  That's one of my favorites.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Jenny from the Block.  That's a good one.  Jenny from the Block.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to look for some Jenny from...  I can deal with that.  Yeah.  He's from a little color to movie scripts.  He's still Freddy in the chair. 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  Oh.  She has a phenomenal stumper.  All right.  We got the girl to do the lap dance for Freddy.  Wow.  She's really moving it.  She can dance.  What the hell is this playing?  All right.  Well, he's pretty much giving a lap dance.  Yeah.  Fred.  Oh. 
[02:55:00]  What a great ass.  Wow.  Look at Fred.  Fred wants to touch so bad, Anthony.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  His hands are going.  Uh-oh.  Fred.  You got to rub on him a little bit, miss.  You got to rub your hiney on his...  Yeah.  Fred will grab.  Watch it.  Do the thing where you put your ponytail in his lap and shake it around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You put your hair in his lap.  Freddy, what do you think?  You ever see that move?  Yeah.  That one.  Yeah.  You got to touch him with his own.  Yeah.  You got to touch him.  There you go.  Wheelchair Fred.  What do you think?  I like. 
[02:55:30]  I like.  I like.  I like.  I like.  I like.  Wow.  Wow.  Why'd you turn the song off?  The good part was coming up.  Oh, okay.  They're playing it in the club.  Show your cleavage.  Wow.  Freddy's going, show your cleavage.  Well, I'm sure all the...  Show him a little belly at least.  Yeah.  Just show him some belly.  Could you show him your thong a little bit?  Poor Fred hasn't seen a woman's thong in a long time.  Yeah, show him a little belly, a little... 
[02:56:00]  Maybe the back of your thong.  She's a good dancer.  And of course, by show Fred, I mean show us.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't care if they wheel Fred into traffic.  Give a shit.  Whatever.  Hack line that was.  We're playing traffic, you.  Are you wearing a thong?  Pull the sides out from the top of your pants.  Yeah.  Yeah, now pull your shirt up a little bit.  That's right.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what we're looking for.  Wheelchair Fred, what do you think?  I like.  I like.  I like.  I like. 
[02:56:30]  Wow.  I like you, Dad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  Freddie, wheelchair Fred wants to grab and grope so bad.  I don't blame him.  Oh, that feedback is just appalling.  She really is.  Hey, how about unsnap in the front of your pants just to open it up a little?  Yeah, you got to show.  Yeah, just opens up.  You see more of the thong.  Yeah, just a little bit.  You're wearing a thong.  You're not naked.  Oh, that's beautiful.  You can show up your height.  Just like that.  That is wonderful. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  See, that's exactly what I was going for.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  The height.  She is really hot.  I'm accepting applications at the UN.  Fish, you got to lift the shirt.  Yeah, lift that shirt up a little bit.  There you go.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  And the flashes are going off like crazy right now.  Very nice.  You know, you're pretty much all the way there.  Can we just see the whole thong?  The thong.  It's a thong.  Yeah.  You know what?  You might as well lose the jeans. 
[02:57:30]  Excuse me, miss.  You're just about there.  Can we just see the whole thong?  It's a thong.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  That's it.  For Fred, you know.  For Fred.  For Fred.  It's for Fred.  For Fred.  For Fred.  For Fred.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  Oh, Fred.  Wow.  She's a good dancer.  What about that, Fred?  Fred is now touching her.  Oh, Fred's poking her like a...  With his finger.  That's the same way Megan Kankow is touched.  He's fucking creep.  Just poking with one dirty finger. 
[02:58:00]  Just a little exploratory finger while she pets the white puppy.  Oh, Fred.  Show yourself.  All right.  Fred, Fred.  Don't throw the ground.  Oh, Fred.  You can't grab.  Fred.  Jesus.  He's losing his mind.  Fred.  You can't grab.  Fred.  I knew we'd get to this point.  What are you doing?  He's just losing his mind.  He's so worked up into a frenzy right now.  I don't blame him.  That is something.  Very, very good.  Oh, he's wiping the corner of his mouth.  That's a sexy look.  Guy in a wheelchair wiping away spittle.  That's good. 
[02:58:30]  He's very sexy, Fred.  Hey, the back of your pants are still up a little too high.  Show them your butt.  I'm a little hiding.  You should be proud of that ass.  That's a wonderful ass.  Is that the boyfriend?  Sir, how are you?  There you go.  I would brag about that.  Of course you should.  Wow.  Don't do something you don't want to do.  I'm trying.  Hey, Fred.  What's that?  Talk into the mic.  Don't do something you don't want to do.  What?  You're the boss. 
[02:59:00]  I don't want to ask you.  What is he saying?  Fred's trying to be diplomatic.  Is this your pick-up line?  Don't do anything you don't want to do.  You're the boss.  Oh, there you go.  He's trying to be sympathetic.  Wow.  Yeah.  It just stopped her in her tracks, though.  Stop with that nice guy shit.  Yeah, Fred had a talk, and he made her stop dancing.  Yeah.  She's putting her pants back up and everything.  What the hell do you do?  She's putting on a suit of armor.  Good job, Fred. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, that was very good.  There she goes.  Wow.  All right.  Very good.  How about a quick flash for the crowd?  They would love it.  A quick flash for the crowd.  We would love it.  Sure.  We don't care about that.  A quick flash for the crowd.  They would love it.  I would love it.  No?  I don't know.  All right.  There it is.  I tried.  Wheelchair Fred and his lap dance, Anthony.  That's great.  I want a girl who will actually grind on his lap, though.  She's got a boyfriend.  She's kind of being cool.  Yeah.  A girl that will...  She's actually doing pretty good, though.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  I mean, believe me.  I got...  Wheelchair Fred just had an accident.  His dick got caught in his spokes.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Very good.  Well, thank you very much.  Give that lady a hand.  She did a bang-up job.  Oh, she's sexy.  Fred, don't even try talking to her.  Yeah.  Fred, what...  Thank you.  That's right.  Oh, he's not letting go.  Yeah.  Oh, he's giving her the eyes.  You see that?  Yeah.  Look, he's trying to hold on.  Fred, Fred, what'd you think of that?  You do.  Does that beat having some guy you picked up at a convenience store bang you? 
[03:00:30]  That's better, I believe.  That's better.  Yeah.  That's really going out on a limb saying that.  Hey, is it weird having a hard-on without your face in a toilet?  Anyway, don't go.  Anyway, don't go.  I'm not gay.  Right.  I'm desperate.  You're just desperate.  What were you doing poking her with your finger?  Yeah.  That was a little odd.  That was smooth.  It drinks her.  That's what you do to the body right before you push it into the shallow grave. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Were you trying to find a place?  I didn't go down there.  Huh?  What?  I didn't go down there.  You could go down there?  I didn't go down there.  I didn't go down there.  Right?  I don't know what he said.  No one does.  I was trying to hold her belly and a bunt.  A bunt?  What?  He pulled her belly and then pulled her back.  I had the belly and the bunt. 
[03:01:30]  I can't.  He punched her belly and...  I have no idea what he's trying to say.  I only touched her...  I pushed wheelchair right off the stage.  Oh, you only...  Jesus.  Literally.  You only touched her belly.  I only touched her belly and the bunt.  Right.  All right.  What we really need here is Richard Widmark to just shove him down the steps.  We really do, man.  You lying old hag.  All right.  What are these girls going to do to your right, Jimmy?  Ooh.  I don't know.  I got to pee.  I don't know what they're going to do.  I have to tinkle.  These two are going to make out, I think.  Oh. 
[03:02:00]  They were going to make out.  Wow.  A little bit of...  Because I see there's a Yankee Red Sox thing going on.  And there's such hatred between the two cities and teams that we thought it would be a great  way to bring together the two cities.  It would be a nice photo op.  Wouldn't it be a great photo op?  Do you guys want to see that?  Do you want to see the Red Sox?  The only thing...  The Red Sox fan and the Yankee fan get along for a minute here?  The only thing that could really, really bring the teams together. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Why don't we bring the girls front and center for this one?  Yeah.  We'll do this.  We'll take a break.  And then we'll wrap up this mess.  Let's take this stuff.  That's wonderful.  All right, Hawk.  Let's clear our pants.  All right.  Here come the girls.  Oh, that's great.  Wait.  You're going out there just to kiss her?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who's kissing who?  But she's wearing the hat.  Well...  It doesn't matter.  Hey.  Could you two change hats? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, triple?  Well, that's even better.  That's even better.  That's great.  That was a whole triple thing going on.  Wow.  All right.  This will bring the cities together, won't it, people?  Yeah, why not?  Yes, yes.  We've got three very hot girls.  A lot of these pictures will be up on the websites, you know, later today.  Oh, but this is what opening day is all about.  Of course.  Throw out the first kiss.  Yes.  Put it out to you.  Because it's not about hating each other.  It's about loving each other, isn't it?  Look at that bloody sock with the string on it. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, wait.  All right.  We're going to play a little game.  At home, you guess when the girls start kissing each other, okay?  Oh, based on certain crowd responses, I would gather, yeah.  All right.  Ladies, whenever you're ready, you do what you have to do.  Why are you taking off their hats?  So they take their hats to the whole prop.  So their bills don't bump.  Good move by Hawk.  Good move by Hawk.  But then you don't know that it was a red rock and making out with a Yankee fan.  All right.  It doesn't matter.  Here we go.  All right.  Well, you guys play along at home.  Guess when the girls start making out.  All right. 
[03:04:00]  Ladies, whenever you're ready.  Whenever you feel it's appropriate.  Don't be shy.  Quickly.  Quickly.  Wait.  Wait.  Jimmy's not happy with this make out session.  You've got to do one on one and then one on one.  Because that just looks like the three of you are three birds grabbing for a worm.  So it's like two of them and one watching.  Yeah.  It's hard to kiss.  You kind of like that.  Well, Jimmy, direct this.  I would just say two kiss and then two kiss. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, it's a little bit easier that way to see what's going on.  All right.  All right.  All right.  These two to the left are kissing first.  Very nice.  Wow.  Oh, they really like each other.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  Very good.  All right.  Now she's going to kiss this one over here.  Very good.  All right.  And now the two on the end now have to kiss.  They haven't kissed yet.  That's right.  Oh, very good.  Jimmy, get your head out of there.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Show your face. 
[03:05:00]  Show your face.  Show your face.  Show your face.  Show your face.  Well, any ladies, if you felt so inclined.  Feel free to indulge the crowd.  Yes.  In their chant.  Give them a little answer.  Might as well.  We're going to be begging again.  All right.  Well, begging.  We'll see what happens during the commercial break.  What are these fucking tards, sweetheart?  Live from Bill's Barthes, the Opie and Anthony program.  We'll continue this.  But we've got to have them in just a few minutes. 
[03:05:30]  Stay there.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  So we're in this conference room making sure that everything's going to be done.  They're asking all of us individually, so what's wrong with your part of the studio?  What's wrong with yours, Ann?  What's wrong, Jim?  What's wrong?  Isn't that great?  They're getting everybody's input on what's wrong, writing it down.  And they're going to fix every problem.  And I believe this was a high-powered meeting, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh...  Big guys, you know what it is?  It was guys that really don't have time to wait to sit there and do anything. 
[03:06:00]  But these guys are always doing something around here.  There's plenty of stuff for them.  Yeah, because they're taking us very seriously, and they want the equipment to work fine when  we get back from vacation.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony and Norton spent the whole meeting staring at Ben's hog.  And laughing like retards.  And laughing like retards.  And that's when I said, ma'am, this show is in trouble.  This was supposed to be the big meeting where we take care of all problems.  I tried so hard to take everything seriously. 
[03:06:30]  And then I look over at Jim, and Jimmy's just pointing.  He's pointing.  You know, Jimmy's to my left, and Ben was to my...  No, Jimmy's to my right.  And Ben was to my left.  So I look over at Jimmy, and he's pointing over me.  So I follow his finger, and he's pointing right at Ben's mule.  Which, the way he's been sitting in his pants was just, like, puffed up like a jiffy pop ready to explode.  Right there.  Look how he had the new studio in his pants.  So now I'm staring at it, and just laughing hysterical. 
[03:07:00]  And we're both staring at it.  And Ben realized what we're doing, and became so self-conscious for the entire meeting.  He then, like, tried to, like, cross his legs and turn.  He goes, you guys are assholes.  And, like, turned his back to us.  And we could still see, so he tried to hide it with some paper.  But he turns towards Ope, and Ope goes, I don't want to look at it.  I don't want to look at it.  Well, no.  Like, you guys are assholes.  Yeah, he turns toward me, and he goes, these guys are being dicks.  I've got to sit this way.  I'm like, dude, I don't want to look at it either, man. 
[03:07:30]  So he covers it with some paper, and after a little while, when he kind of forgot about it,  I just slowly lean over and started pulling the paper away.  He's like, duck it off.  And me and Jimmy are laughing so hard, I was crying.  I had tears going down my face.  And the guys in the meeting were so pissed off, they just finally were like, well, is there any other problem?  Or is this meeting just going to degenerate?  Degenerate further?  Further.  And I'm like, no.  And then I try to blame Jimmy.  I go, it's him.  He's making me laugh. 
[03:08:00]  And then Jimmy goes, it's not me, it's Ben's fuel.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Live from Boston, Massachusetts.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony and I do not have to do a smart radio program anymore.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a cluster up, man. 
[03:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony program live in Boston.  Got to love it.  We knew this would be a really bad idea, but fuck it.  Yeah, somebody said, hey, how about opening day up in Boston?  We went, yeah, sure.  And then we forgot we were taking two weeks off before that.  Yep.  I think it was Ben's idea, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Dude, I'll get so many guests. 
[03:09:00]  It'd be amazing.  It's going to be a big celebrity.  Yeah, I got to thank Ben personally for all the great guests we got today.  Yeah, well, let's review God's Fat, which was very cool.  Herky Jerky!  Herky Jerky!  Herky Jerky!  There he is.  Herky Jerky!  The Herky Jerky chant.  Pedro is all about the socks, yo.  Hey, what is that shirt?  That's a cool wow shirt.  What's it say? 
[03:09:30]  No, I can't read the red.  This is a guy I've met online.  It's an O&A Party Rock 2005 tour.  Yay!  O&A Party Rock.  All right.  So we had Godsmack.  We had Spaulding.  We had Spaulding from the Caddyshack movie.  And then Bill Lee.  Oh, Bill Lee, right, right.  Forgot about Bill Lee.  We forgot to talk about it.  Remember we were talking to Ben about Bill Lee last night.  He's like, dude, this was the hardest thing to set up.  Wait, that was set up?  Bill Lee was really hard to get a hold of and stuff. 
[03:10:00]  That was set up?  I thought he just stumbled in here.  No, Ben said it was really hard to get Bill Lee on the program.  Yeah.  And me and Jim were talking about, what, he had to go through five or six Bill Lees on  the phone book before he found the right one?  How hard could it be to get Bill Lee?  That was a lot of work.  When you're herking, jerking on that little phone trying to dial the numbers, it is hard  work.  I don't want to blow the big surprise.  I hear tomorrow we have Ed Figueroa calling in.  Figueroa.  Yeah, who do we have on the program tomorrow for the Paradise? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, that's a good tease.  Ben, who do we have for tomorrow?  You're going to check your email?  Wow.  So Ben checking his email is going to be our celebrity guest.  Cool.  How many of you guys are going to be at the Paradise tomorrow?  All right, a few.  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe we'll be able to do some real radio tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah, everyone else has had it.  Well, this is really cool.  Oh, stop.  Put that down.  Stupid Billy Crystal.  By the way, they finally got Wheelchair Fred off the stage.  Yeah, I saw that.  It was almost disaster.  We're in this long commercial break and Wheelchair Fred's just sitting there waiting for someone 
[03:11:00]  to help him out.  Yeah, he obviously can't get down by himself.  And I don't think there were as many people helping him down as helped him up, so it really  got a little shaky there for a second.  It looked like he was going to teeter over backwards.  How great would it have been if a fire broke out and everybody ran out except for him?  And just leave him in?  I like Fred.  I can't breathe.  I smoke in the legs.  What? 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Where are we going after this?  We don't have tickets.  Yeah, we don't have tickets for the game.  Well, Ben had a ticket, but he gave it to some employee.  We don't really know who he gave it to.  He doesn't know either.  I wish we worked for a company that actually had exclusive satellite rights to broadcast  Major League Baseball.  Then we'd probably have a ticket.  Oh.  What?  Oh, wait.  They what?  How did we not get tickets to this game?  Well, they had one, but they gave it to Bob Edwards.  Ah, I don't doubt it.  That ghoul.  How the hell don't we rate tickets? 
[03:12:00]  We don't have tickets.  Why?  What's going on down there?  I'm just pointing at her breast.  I have guests.  Should we talk to Wheelchair Lawrence, see if he had a good time today?  Oh, Wheelchair Larry.  Yeah.  Tickets.  Yeah.  I had a good time.  Good time?  Yeah.  Nice.  Cool.  All right.  He had a good time.  Well, you guys have been at other events before, haven't you?  Okay, I reckon that.  Yeah, they go wherever we go when we're up this way.  Yeah.  All right, Fred, you like Wheelchair Larry there or Lawrence?  Whatever his name is.  I need a place to stay if you want me tomorrow. 
[03:12:30]  He doesn't even care.  He just said, I need a place to stay until tomorrow.  Don't look at me, bro.  Yeah, maybe I'll listen.  Don't look at me.  Yeah.  Fred.  It's not like the old days where I used to drag you around.  I can't get out.  Fred.  Fred.  You know where the Sheridan is in Back Bay?  Room 315.  315.  Well, do you want me tomorrow?  No, we don't really need you tomorrow.  Trust me.  Oh.  I'd like to see Fred come tomorrow. 
[03:13:00]  Okay.  I'll tell you what.  I'll give you a rope and a grappling hook, and you can stand by Route 9.  Give it a little whoosh, and a car goes by.  It'll be like you're taking off of a carrier deck.  I didn't come tomorrow.  Maybe you'll be there.  Wait.  We'll see what happens.  Give it a try.  Hey, I have an idea for a Mifi.  If someone could bring Ben some conditioner.  That is the driest hair I've ever seen. 
[03:13:30]  Hey, tumbleweed hair.  Where are you going?  I didn't realize until I saw the light hitting it how dry his hair is.  He has been working on that phone.  Hey, spaghetti out of the box hair.  Turkey, turkey.  These guys just hammered.  All right.  Well, we can maybe play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy, because that went so well last time we played it in New York.  That's true.  What does this guy have to say?  Yes, sir?  I'm from Allendale Fire Department 9, New Jersey. 
[03:14:00]  Met fan.  That's what I say.  I've been listening to you guys since 1998.  You guys rock.  I would like you to sign my hat.  No.  We'll sign a bunch of stuff once the show is over, sir.  I would say this is better when you guys spent the state in Buffalo.  Uh-oh.  The state of Buffalo.  You really fucked that up.  Much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  All right.  Anyone else?  We really have nothing left, so it must be hard to be a fireman in Jersey.  I would just say let it burn.  Let's go to the next guy here in Jersey. 
[03:14:30]  I think we learned absolutely shit today.  It was a clusterfuck, but it was fun.  Thank you.  That is what we learned.  That's a nice yellow discipline shirt, sir.  All right.  You guys, if you want to walk up.  I bought it on eatabullet.com.  Oh.  All right.  If you guys want, you can walk up to the microphone that Eric is holding.  We'll take some questions from the other.  Green Day and Opening Day rocks.  Go Shots!  Yeah!  Oh, God.  You know, I don't think anyone here has tickets to the game, by the way.  No, they don't.  No, no.  Of course not.  No.  I learned that Opie and Anthony are going to be live from the station nightclub tomorrow, 
[03:15:00]  7 to 11.  Wow.  That's a callback.  Wow.  And you're getting a lot of thumbs down in the room today.  Yes, sir.  Eric is just working the crowd now, Anthony.  Let's see what we can get.  I learned that the security guards here look like a couple of faggots.  Jesus.  Are you the guy with the, uh, no?  Wow.  Oh, man.  He is eyeing you.  He's not happy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, look at him.  He's like, what's up? 
[03:15:30]  What's up?  Yeah, you come over here.  Look at him.  He's haunting him now.  He's not happy.  All right.  Eric is working the crowd.  If anyone has anything, Eric's got the mic.  He's making his way to the back.  Oh, wow.  What a ballsy guy.  He's right in the middle of him.  Yep.  I learned that Jimmy Norton will be live at the end of this month at the  Comedy Connection.  Jimmy, you want that phone number?  I don't have the number, sir.  It's 411 for you lazy fucks.  Yeah, just look under a huge cock and Blumenreich's number will pop out.  Beatabullet.com?  Yeah.  I'll be from Sirius. 
[03:16:00]  I'll be at Nick's at the end of the month.  I learned that there's a reason Spaulding only made one movie.  Poor Spaulding.  Selling real estate.  All right.  Anyone else out there?  Eric is working the crowd.  We learned that O&A are better live at the Hard Rock than up in Boston.  No.  Oh.  I would say it was very comparable.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Of course, the feedback up in Boston, a lot worse than we had in New York. 
[03:16:30]  Woo.  Stop it.  I'll blame Boston for the feedback.  All right.  Let's see what this guy has.  I learned that the Yankees suck.  Who's breathing?  Thank you.  You ass.  Oh, yes.  The obligatory Yankees suck chant.  All right.  Eric, you've got to come back.  The feedback's too much.  Eric is making his way back to the stage.  Eric, you've got to.  Eric, no, no, no.  No, Eric, over there.  Eric, get that.  No.  But there's, but the other, the.  Eric, if you go this way.  No.  And then.  That way. 
[03:17:00]  He's giving us.  I learned.  I learned not to make fun of the bouncers and then go take a piss.  We're back.  Exactly.  Kick your ass, man.  I learned that that guy's belt buckle's bigger than his dick.  Holy.  Get a little dick.  Oh, my God.  They're taunting the bouncers.  I know.  Guys.  It is.  Oh, good.  He came out with a camera.  He's going to take pictures of these schmucks and then beat them up later.  When they come back two weeks from now.  Remember I said that to you? 
[03:17:30]  Whack.  All right.  Go ahead.  I learned that toothless girls still have nice tits.  Nice.  What happened there?  I don't know.  Leave all heroin mouth alone.  Is she still here?  I don't know.  Who are you talking about?  Do you think that was from poor hygiene or a baseball bat?  Maybe a combination of both?  A combination of the two.  Let's see.  I don't think poor hygiene, though.  No?  I learned Anthony's got to watch out for the balls when he drinks his banana daiquiris.  Thank you. 
[03:18:00]  Wow.  We did learn something today.  That was something learned.  We'll have all our vacation stories, maybe tomorrow or Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Back in the comfort of our own studio.  Yes.  I heard Connor Peterson's armpits really fucking hot.  Wow.  You really had a hard time getting that out, didn't you?  He panicked.  I heard.  Oh, my God.  What?  It's not what did I hear, stupid.  It's what did I learn.  He heard.  He heard.  He just poured on the street. 
[03:18:30]  Rumor has it.  Rumor has it.  I'm feeling good until he saw that microphone.  Connor Peterson.  I'm dumb.  Darn.  Something about.  Oh, my God.  I learned that it cost 30 bucks to see that.  Jim Norton's going to get the call.  Oh, you stink.  You stink.  You stink.  So eager to get that line out, weren't you?  And that one really hurt because you were plugging my dumb show.  30 bucks to see me.  What, are the connections?  April 29th and 30th, 617-248. 
[03:19:00]  9,700.  He actually wrote it down and he screwed it up.  He wrote it down and he still tripped on it.  I learned that.  He bought $30 to see Artie Lang.  Jim Norton.  Nervous idiot.  All right.  We got others.  Let's go, buddy.  I learned that Bill Lee's a shit dick.  Oh, well.  People were yelling.  We were yelling that out.  All right.  What else?  I learned that cripples are more gooder when they're out of sight, out of mind.  Oh, God.  Jesus. 
[03:19:30]  It's not really...  You offended a Boston audience.  You know how hard that was to do?  You brought the entire mood of the audience down and they were ready to...  And the guy's standing right next to the guy in the wheelchair.  You are awful.  How did you violate these people's morality?  They keep the Charles Stewart...  Fuck, I suck.  You were so eager to get it out.  I know.  Well, I was going to say the Charles Stewart live story in the comedy section, but I went,  Charles Stewart...  That's called not committing. 
[03:20:00]  Maybe I should read it off my own plug paper.  Fuck it.  All right.  Who else?  Word has it.  Yeah.  I learned that Jimmy's tits really aren't that big.  Oh.  They look good, right?  I see him.  Show your tits.  No, sir.  No, sir.  I certainly won't.  No?  All right.  Most not.  Anyone else?  We're going to end with a Brian Regan baseball bit, by the way.  It's kind of an educational program.  I didn't think so.  Show your tits!  I think we're... 
[03:20:30]  Anyone else out in the crowd want to say something?  How about...  Do you want to hear a few words from the security guards?  Yeah.  That kept everyone safe?  Yeah.  They looked out for us the whole show.  They did a good job.  That's true.  They should be able to have a little equal time.  Let's go to him.  Go to him?  I'm the manager here.  Yeah.  So if anybody that wants to say anything about my security, fuck you.  There you go.  And second of all, there's a New York Yankees fan into my front door, and he's a big black  angry man, so fuck with him, too. 
[03:21:00]  Whoa.  Where is he?  Is he a security guy, the big guy?  Yeah, he's at the front door.  Yeah, he's...  So if anybody has the balls to say anything, hello, I'm right here.  He is right there.  Oh, sir.  So I think what he's saying is if any of you shit dicks want to talk shit, he's right  there.  Anyone?  That's what he's saying.  Wait, Ben, Ben, Ben.  Hey, to my good buddy over there who made his comment, you got a problem.  He wants to say, I'm right here.  There's a nice little walkway right here.  Come on up.  Oh, boy.  Oh, let's go.  I'll hook you in the fucking face with the belt buckle.  See how that feels.  Wow. 
[03:21:30]  That is...  Yeah, let's have to just degenerate into some ass-kicking.  Yeah.  Come on.  And if that doesn't work, hit him with the cock.  Well, I think with that, we're going to wrap up this mess.  Why?  It's not a mess.  Is it really?  It was pretty good for what it was.  I, um...  Stop touching Anthony.  All right.  So tomorrow we're at the Paradise here in Boston.  Yes.  And then Wednesday we'll be back in New York City.  Wait, go back to that.  And we're going back to our new studio, Anthony.  Yes.  They spent two weeks fixing our studio in New York. 
[03:22:00]  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  Thank you so very much.  O-N-A!  O-N-A!  Well, Prozac on Wackback is saying,  I learned Boston killed the Yanks in Game 7.  They killed your show today.  Yeah.  And, Jim, are you going to watch that couple have sex or not for the MiFi?  We'll talk about it, yeah, and I'll give you a full report.  They're actually coming to Atlantic City, too.  So, yeah.  Oh.  I hope I can watch them.  Can we go into the Brian Regan bed or what? 
[03:22:30]  All right, well, no, no, no, we're out of here.  You guys, thanks so much for coming out.  Are we going to sign a little bit here?  Yeah, we'll hang out and sign shit and take pictures.  Our first live show after a two-week break.  Thank you for putting up with this mess.  And we'll do it again tomorrow at the Paradise,  live from Boston, the Open Anthony program.  I guess we're going to end with this Brian Regan baseball snow cone bit.  Let her rip.  Go soccer.  Thank you, Boston. 
[03:23:00]  They got me in a little league baseball.  I played out in right field because I stunk.  But you don't know.  You just show up, you know.  I got my glove.  You any good?  I don't know.  My mom told me to come out here.  We'll get out in right field.  Okay.  Turn around, you moron.  Oh, okay.  Not the whole way.  Oh, only some.  Some way.  I never knew what was going on out in right field. 
[03:23:30]  All I knew is at the end of the game, I'd get a free snow cone.  That's all I knew.  Be out there.  Oh, free snow cone.  Free snow cone.  Brian, what's the score?  Free snow cone.  Free snow cone at the end of the game.  If you play, they're going to give you a free snow cone.  Even if you play half game, you get the whole.  You don't get a half snow cone.  You get a whole snow cone for half the game.  The people that play whole game get a whole snow cone. 
[03:24:00]  And the people that play half game get a whole snow cone.  So it's always whole.  Always whole snow cone.  So I'd rather play half game.  I'd rather play half game.  Still get the whole snow cone.  How many outs, Brian?  Grape.  I'm going to get grape or cherry.  They're both favorites.  So either one is good.  If they have both, I'll get grape, though, because that's a little more favorite. 
[03:24:30]  But if they don't have grape, it's like, oh, that's fine, because cherry's favorite anyway.  It's like another favorite, but not as much.  Not as much favorite.  But they're both good.  They're both good.  All right, Brian, you just have fun out there.  Okay.  The second baseman would give me signals to get me involved in the game, you know.  He'd, like, you know, put his outside fingers up.  Okay, Brian, got two away.  Two away, Brian. 
[03:25:00]  I don't know what he's talking about.  Okay.  Brian, two away.  You two.  And our coach would yell from the dugout every now and then, you know.  Hey, guys, let's hear some chatter out there.  Let's hear some chatter.  What are we, rabbits?  Might as well have been, you know. 
[03:25:30]  Chattering is saying, hey, batter, batter, over and over again.  I don't think I ever felt like more of an idiot in my whole life.  Out in the field going, hey, batter, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey, batter.  Hey.  Hey, batter, batter, batter.  Hey.  Hey, coach, is there a point to this? 
[03:26:00]  What is that for the batter's benefit?  Hey, batter, batter.  Hey, fielder, fielder.  Hey, batter, batter, batter.  Hey, fielder, fielder, fielder.  They're communicating.  And as the ball got to them, we're all supposed to lean in and go, hey, batter, batter.  Swing.  Like he couldn't get a hit when he yelled that.  Swinging up.  Did you hear what they yelled, coach?  If that's fair, they should do that in all adult sports, you know.  I'd like to see that out in the golf course. 
[03:26:30]  You know, hey, golfer, golfer.  Hey, golfer, golfer, golfer, pot, pot, golfer.  Straight there, pot.  What the hell's the matter with you, Ralph?  I'm just trying to make it fun.  Why do you learn that?  Are you supposed to apply that later in life?  Hey, lawyer, lawyer.  Hey, lawyer.  Lawyer, lawyer.  Hey, lawyer.  Sue.  Sue, lawyer.  Bus driver, bus driver.  Drive, drive.  Shift, bus driver. 
[03:27:00]  What the hell's the matter with you?  I learned that as a kid.  He's just applying it.  The only compliment I ever got in Little League Baseball was, good eye, Brian.  Good eye, Brian.  Yeah, well, thank you.  Good torso.  I noticed you during the trunk rotation.  Good eye.  Good eye.  They would say that when you're too scared to even consider swinging the bat. 
[03:27:30]  The ball would graze your head at about 100 miles an hour.  Ah!  Good eye, Brian.  Oh, thank you.  What did I do?  You moved your head of the way of the fastball.  Oh, good, good.  I'm glad I did that.  I almost didn't, but then I did.  Go, team.  Go, team.  Go.  I used to get scared getting up the bat.  And what made it worse was the kids out on the field on the other team.  I don't even know these kids.  And they're all out there yelling, easy out. 
[03:28:00]  Easy out.  Everybody move in.  Easy out.  How do you handle that when you're nine years old?  Hey, they're walking towards me.  The outfielders are playing in on the clay.  The infielders are going through my pockets.  Easy out.  Easy out.  I'm like going, hey, that's my gum. 
[03:28:30]  I played softball this last year.  I struck out in slow pitch softball.  Let me tell you something.  It's not a whole lot more humbling in life than striking out in slow pitch.  Walk back to the dugout.  You know, your teammates are older than Little League.  They try not to laugh, but it's kind of hard not to.  You know, you sit next to them, they're going.  What can they say?  Wow, wow, he throws a wicked 12-foot arc. 
[03:29:00]  It's hard to hit in only three tries.  It should be a bigger ball.  It should be a kickball.  We should play 10-strike kickball.  That's what we should do.  They call it softball.  It makes it sound like it's harmless, you know.  You ever take a line shot to the face with a softball?  You don't go, hey, that's downy soft.  That was like a big ball of cotton.  Hey, don't worry about that.  That's blood light.  We're playing softball. 
[03:29:30]  We're all going to float around like angels.  This concludes our broadcast day.  You'll be in the Anthony show.  Don.  I think we're off the air.  All right.  Don.  I hate that they can do that to us.  What was the last word that was said tonight?  Today.  What?  That ought to hold the little fuckers.  I don't know.  That ought to know.  Thank you.  On foot.  That ought to go.  See you.  Watch me.  See you.  Hey.  See you.  See you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  See you.  Bye-bye. 
[03:30:00]  See you.  See you.  Bye-bye. </pre>
