<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a discussion of their ratings success with male listeners, contrasting it with their lower ranking among women.  Opie briefly mentioned a trip to Action Park and acupuncture before the conversation shifted to the New York City heatwave, mocking the overblown media coverage.  A caller recounted a news weatherman’s failed attempt to fry an egg on the sidewalk.  The hosts expressed their disdain for horse-drawn carriages, particularly in the heat.  The discussion then moved to Elaine Robert’s skyscraper climb, criticizing news channels for interrupting coverage with sports and weather.  They also mentioned a second, less successful climber. A caller shared his own building-climbing experience. The hosts then discussed a window washer's improbable survival after a 47-story fall, contrasting it with his brother's death in the same incident, followed by a recounting of a man surviving a 10,000-foot parachute-less jump.  A clip of Big Brown's jockey was played for comedic effect.

The show significantly covered their recent animation festival at the Roseland Ballroom.  They expressed mixed feelings about its success, citing server issues affecting online animation access. They discussed various submitted animations, highlighting favorites and criticizing others, particularly one animator's complaints. The hosts criticized this animator's behavior.  The discussion included plans for a future event and humorous anecdotes, such as using the studio's stripper pole for storage. A clip of Roland’s festival introduction and Danny's attempt to tickle Roland were played.  Anthony Cumia’s country music album was promoted, along with the upcoming iPhone release. Bob Kelly was a guest in the studio during this segment.

Comedians Russman, Eve, Dan Adderman, and Mikey Stefano were in-studio guests for a segment recapping the animation festival, which awarded $10,000. The winning animation parodied *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*, featuring Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy. A YouTube video of someone tickling Roland was referenced. Anthony discussed his Nashville trip, including his flight on American Airlines, and engaged in offensive commentary about race and celebrity deaths, while also discussing the possibility of smuggling a gun onto a plane. Robert Kelly’s presence in the studio was noted, along with the success of *Kung Fu Panda*, and a highly critical and offensive discussion of a "pregnant man" from the news.  The death of Jim McKay was announced, leading to reminiscences about *Wide World of Sports*. A significant portion focused on Anthony's relationship with Jill Nicolini, including a Nashville bar crawl, a photo of Anthony in a Western outfit, and speculation about a ring on Jill's finger.  A minor altercation with Roseland Ballroom security was described using highly offensive language.  The segment concluded with further discussion about the relationship and humorous banter, including a call about Anthony's reduced Call of Duty playtime.

A post-show segment, with Robert Kelly in-studio, covered Hillary Clinton's withdrawal from the presidential race, John McCain's health, and the performances of comedians Dan Natterman, Russ Meneve, and Mike DeStefano at the festival. The discussion included audience reactions, particularly the booing of Natterman and Meneve.  The conversation became extremely vulgar and sexually explicit, including listener calls and a listener question about paying to smell Anthony's fingers. A sexually graphic description of various sexual acts and a humorous impersonation of a listener were featured. The segment concluded with further discussion about audience behavior, listener feedback, and crude humor.

Another segment featured a caller, Brad, whose call devolved into a humorous bit about the smell of genitalia. This transitioned into a discussion of a Tokyo stabbing spree and a Five-Hour Energy sponsorship, further devolving into sexually explicit and vulgar conversations, including homophobic and misogynistic slurs.  Prank calls to C-SPAN were discussed, along with graphic descriptions of sexual acts from a caller.  Bob Kelly's Iraq experiences, including an encounter with jackals mistaken for werewolves, were recounted, along with his missing DVDs and his ex-girlfriend's possible involvement.  The upcoming iPhone release and the animation contest, with the hosts arguing offensively about the results, were also discussed.  A Paul Anka clip and a "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" clip were played.

A final segment included a game of identifying voice impressions (Joe Pesci and "Angry Baby"), a discussion of viewer-submitted animations, including “Ecstasy of Gold,” and a “Line of the Day” segment featuring offensive listener jokes. Bobby, a caller, promoted his stand-up show. Jimmy recounted a bizarre experience at a military base involving classified information about Predator technology.  The segment continued with more voice impressions and listener jokes. A recording of Earl Weaver using profane and misogynistic language in fan mail was played.  The broadcast ended with banter about the iPhone release, a fictitious virus, and a disparaging remark about an in-studio audience member.

[00:06:30]  that's it for the poor horse yeah that's good a nice carriage ride will do the trick in a hundred  degree weather yeah the horse is thrilled about that it's like why don't they just get camels to pull  these things i think they could take the heat a little more than these poor horses oh god they  should stop those horse buggy things aren't they awful terrible i swear when i when i ride by it would  be counterproductive but i want to drive my car into the horse i won't do it because that would hurt the  horse yeah i wish it was just to knock the man over and let the horse be all right with his stupid top 
[00:07:00]  hat like it's the 1800s pulling up to a hotel just stop it already it's it's ancient history it might have  been uh a cute thing to do years ago not now they're replacing uh the horses with the foreign  guys that uh riding around on bikes on the stupid bicycle rickshaw who's jumping in those  oh a ton of people every day in central parts uh matt virginia what's up hey boys what's going on 
[00:07:30]  good morning matt just getting started here when i was eating my dinner i uh last night i like to watch  local news because it's really bad they throw it to the weather guy outside he goes god it's so hot  out here you can fry an egg and a dumb sumbitch cracks an egg on the ground and just lays there  and they throw it right back to the desk that old gag oh that's perfect and it didn't cook up huh  no i guess he was thinking it was going to do something but i swear to god he cracked it and  just ran how about two eggs one for before the broadcast to see if it will do anything yeah 
[00:08:00]  and then one during the broadcast and i've seen people do that and you got to crack it it's got  to be a hundred degrees out and you have to crack it on something metal that's really big you can't  just put it on the sidewalk yeah because the metal uh you know it really absorbs the heat absolutely  all right thank you matt love it was nothing like serving up an ice cream cone four two three four  five six seven eight nine maybe seven girls seven ice cream cones it's beautiful here two girls one 
[00:08:30]  cup girls are really enjoying it seven girls one ice cream cone now that i gotta see wow wowie  did the news just talk about ice cream on a hot day of course yeah there's no war going on or  anything right let's say hi to mike on long island mike hey what's up boys hey mike uh just what's  going on just uh i heard you talking about the uh the horses and the carriages those you know what's 
[00:09:00]  but uh after it turns 90 degrees the aspca cops start pulling around and start trying to shut them  down oh good really good yeah yeah like like the ones you see on uh the animal planet right on come  around and yeah once it turns 90 degrees they shut them down that's it good they shouldn't be allowed  those guys should go home to their filthy homes or they should let the horses go to their house and  they should just lay lay in the stable all the horse has the little marks on them from pulling these fat  people stop it the fat tourists that need to take the carriage ride through central park who's doing 
[00:09:30]  that why is that by the way what movie was was that in that everyone is trying to read that yeah a huge  thing i'm so sure it's something from the 40s you rarely see a local in in one of those uh horse and  buggies and and when it's not uh hot out they put the stinky horse blanket over you yeah full of horse  hair and crap and whatever else stench was on the last horse that had it on him ticks oh yeah fleas  whatever maybe a few crabs i'd go full release underneath it and just mess it up 
[00:10:00]  oh tavern on the green oh and now where are we  oh we're going down a roadway 800 taxis that do it 60 miles an hour wow this is amazing it's just  like ye olde days it's it's like it's not this endearing little fun uh throwback to the old days 
[00:10:30]  meh meh meh meh but you uh you don't give a crap about animals though you you care about the  horses plates i've always been a a lover of uh horses oh that's true i've been to that oregon  farm uh many times no that's true you are a horse lover yeah like a i like a good horse you think big  brown's getting uh beat up uh this morning the disaster that was last place for big brown as he's  going for the triple crown what do you think as a horse lover how many people lost money wheeling 
[00:11:00]  that thing i think i think they pulled back because that hoof looked like it was going to fall off and  they probably said all right they knew within seconds look this thing you know there's no way  he's going to win this thing let's say the horse gate with that you know oomph i would that fervor  didn't bust out of the gate didn't bust out of the gate with fervor so they decide to pull back  that's that's what i'm thinking yeah because how else does it come in dead last because it's going  for the triple crown and then a what a 38 to 1 the horse won yeah long shot won it all with that 
[00:11:30]  yeah a few people i was reading the paper yesterday one guy goes uh i won two thousand dollars and now  i'm going to atlantic city to make make even even more hey give it back there you go there you go fun  i like the fact that the horse is hurt foot he refused to run quickly yeah good that's what he  should do his foot hurts when he stay home put me in a race dummies uh let's go to bob in jersey  bobby hey how you doing guys hey there bob talk about a hot job i'm on my way to a roof right now 
[00:12:00]  we're gonna be pumping up 600 degree asphalt up on a roof today oh these were the worst days  anthony was there oh when i worked for him i used to have to cut in curbs for uh air conditioning units  and i'd be up on a roof with a sawzall cutting through tar and and metal and  and and and and then you'd have to tar in the uh thing that the air conditioning unit sits on 
[00:12:30]  and the tar was just so runny in the heat and goopy it would get everywhere on you  and then you're just driving home full of tar and hot do you miss that oh yeah yeah i miss that a lot  he wants to go back to that ah the days so what do you got to do when you got to put an air  conditioning on top of like an industrial building you get it would drill like a little wedge a ridge  for it to go in yeah you gotta you gotta cut a hole in there in the roof something that's like you  know four feet by two feet or sometimes four feet by four feet just a huge hole in the roof and then 
[00:13:00]  the corrugated metal that's underneath when you look up in a warehouse you see like the metal part of  the roof all that just comes falling down that the insulation on top and the tar comes falling down  and then you get something called a curb it's like this thing that's about two feet high that goes  around the hole that you got to drill screw down and then you got to sit the unit on top a big crane  comes up and sits it up there and then you got to uh tar the the curb so no uh water gets in on the 
[00:13:30]  roof and it's just sitting there with tar paper and tar and getting as messy and tar doesn't come  off with you know soap and water you got to use kerosene and you just leave smelling like a  refinery you got to use kerosene and a brillo pad yeah there have been times i use like a wire brush  on my hands just a horrible job i feel bad for those bastards i guess you really get into radio dummies 
[00:14:00]  i guess you really did work for a living oh after all these years you finally described what you did  on the job too hard we heard everything else about how you would sneak out and jet ski oh yeah  sneak out and go to the booby bars sneak out and go to otv occasionally to keep my job i had to do it  once in a while call in sick with the sick voice we heard all those stories but not an actual  story of doing the job that was terrible hey jimmy your boy uh climbed the the new york times building  on friday you you've been talking about this guy for years elaine robert and i heard bbc is doing 
[00:14:30]  it did a documentary on him elaine robert he does it without uh equipment yeah he does it with his  bare hands and he has rosin i think which he has on his back and he puts his hand in just to keep his  fingers moist yeah but he's done the uh the tower in uh where's the tower uh mike it's the thailand  oh the big one yeah the double the dual did that he went all the way to the top on youtube  no he didn't go to the top because they kept arresting him he only got so high but he got 
[00:15:00]  like 70 stories up or something but then they he couldn't go any higher because they would stop him  um yeah he's done the sears tower uh i think the hancock building he's done the empire state  building apparently he's just gonna fall to his death someday i think he will too but yeah he does  these buildings quickly he doesn't he doesn't take like they used to use equipment they would take like an  hour two hours he'll be up in 40 minutes he just jumps on and climbs he's never gonna fall to his  death no he's a rock climber doesn't matter the building's a lot easier than than climbing uh you 
[00:15:30]  know a rock face too huh one you know one wrong move one one true true something like a cramp but  these buildings are like a ladder to to rock climbers and then you'd be there like and then as he's  falling we're going you know i knew this was gonna happen one day well the new york times building  was pretty much like a ladder it was the easiest climb you see that what a climb that what a dumb  design yeah let's go and then some dude from brooklyn what four or five hours later he was  trying to say that he was going to climb it on friday as well and it was just a coincidence come 
[00:16:00]  on he got pissed off that this guy beat him to it uh what's his name again jimmy elaine robert  robert really and he got mad because he was planning on doing he said screw it i'm gonna do it the same  day so he came into the city and did it as well he did it too yeah two guys on friday you didn't know  that no i kind of heard about it but i didn't really pay attention why why didn't that register  with me that was the one i was watching on the news live and the news felt like they still needed  to do uh sports and weather in the middle of that guy's climb i'm like what is wrong with the news 
[00:16:30]  this is your moment think out of the box why do you need to do sports and weather just because you do  it every day and they went and they made uh the climber into a tiny little box as as as the weather  dude is telling us it's gonna be hot of course it's hot we know get back to the guy that might  fall off the building at any moment especially because he's not a professional like robert do  you know every time i see a tall building now i swear i look at buildings all the time and i  wonder how would you climb that i mean of course none of them would i touch yeah i think he would  scoot like the grace building i'd love to see him climb there's a building here on in new york on 57th 
[00:17:00]  and it's massive but it kind of angles what's the word it uh kind of concave almost uh oh yeah yeah  curve to it yeah right right and uh i always think could he climb this one could he come i'm  like a little boy it's all a matter of wonderment for me just trying to figure it out how would he  do it uh the dumb news why would you do your your weather in sports this is the moment everyone's  watching live tv going holy s is a second guy climbing the new york times building and it looks 
[00:17:30]  like he's not even a professional he's never done this before that's a great story but they have to go  to sports then they have to go to weather and then at uh i think it was 6 30 they had to end the news  they don't even stay with it the guy has 15 20 stories to go and they don't even stay with the  dude you have a schedule yeah well if the news can't like readjust their schedule then why are  we even watching at all why are we watching i heard that in chicago when he did the sears tower  that he has to be weather has to be good for him too obviously and i heard he got way up on the 
[00:18:00]  sears tower like 80 out of the 100 floors and then the fog came in and so it made it really wet  uh from the fog touch in the building and it took him he finished the building but it took him a long  time to finish it the last 20 floors right because it was wet huh how creepy is that i'll send you way  up there and it's just wet your fingers are like i'm just sliding off of things oh yeah it's horrifying  yikes your feet you never see him do it you've never seen this guy climb he'll he'll he'll just 
[00:18:30]  he'll stretch his arms out wide and just begin scaling pulling himself up by the hands and his  little feet are wedged in against like the sides of the little feet yeah what are you doing don't  do that take the elevator yeah really you're not i just said that there's a picture of him i climbed uh  i i talked about this a few times but i climbed uh four stories back in college on the outside of a  building four stories doing the spider-man walk though what between two uh between two walls walls 
[00:19:00]  so one hand or one foot you know loses its grip you're falling all the way down three or four  you're sliding huh or you're sliding down there was no sliding because it was brick there was no  sliding whatsoever the only what was holding me up was pushing my hands and my feet against the the  walls i did that so i could have been one of these guys i would have i wouldn't huh he went much  higher you went what do you want yes i did three or four stories on the outside of a building that  way it was kind of creepy that's three i've done actually i've done that i'm trying to push four 
[00:19:30]  stories but but then i'm thinking there's a lot of people that went to geneseo and they're gonna go  dude that dorm was only three stories high so i've done the exact same thing though that opie's talking  about it's kind of with the hands and stuff uh it was a game called splinter cell and uh i would do  that and then i would jump down on people and choke them out with a piano wire and that was it yeah  there's a photo of right now elaine robert taken from like the high point of the building and you  kind of looking through two metal slats and you can see it looks like a cop is that a cop oh yeah 
[00:20:00]  it's a cop just having lunch a safety harness which makes him just look like a sissy as elaine robert  with a collared shirt yeah collared shirt and he's climbing the uh the outside of this uh of the  structure the cops just probably sitting there going please don't make me grab you please just come  yeah throw some of those pictures up on onaradio.com all right hey we're just getting warmed up for  another fine week of radio on the way we got to talk about our animation festival that happened  on thursday at the roseland ballroom a huge success and uh a bit disappointing at the same time 
[00:20:30]  and also anthony went to nashville he might have a story or two i don't know oh yeah we will uh  i don't know if anybody wants to uh call and tell me what i did oh really the weekend that was a lot  of fun a lot of bars down there i'll tell you how much maybe a little i had a great time and there  might be fun there might be some anthelini controversy my friend what happened i'm just  saying there might be a little controversy my friend why we'll get into it next jesus what a tease 
[00:21:00]  you're teasing me well getting ready to talk about nashville yeah it's the opian anthony show good  morning to everybody a couple of instant feedbacks matt from carol uh carol fornia no it would be  california i love how you guys are more caring about horses than you are water heads uh ralph from  belleville writes the rest of us love sports stars and entertainers jimmy loves a lunatic who 
[00:21:30]  illegally climbs buildings yeah we just spent the whole break looking at video of what's his name  again robert elaine robert yeah elaine robert i gotta remember his name now yeah he's the greatest  some of the shots they got of him it's just downright freak it's scary well the bbc documentary  is called the human spider i've not seen it i imagine online you can see clips of it and uh i'm watching  some of the footage my hands my my palms just sweat yeah he's up so high and there's nothing for him 
[00:22:00]  to hang on to what scares me is like when you get to a certain height like when you get to the top of  the building almost there's a lot of times cops waiting for you and seeing other people at that  height waiting like to picture yourself in his position looking up and seeing other people at that  height no no i i don't want to and uh as we're in the break uh it turns out that uh a stunt ankles  did something that i have always never wanted to do but thought of which was uh you went up in the 
[00:22:30]  uh this is amazing and the world trade center used to have these window washing  gondolas they have gondolas that were on a rail system that would slide down and they had three  or four different sets of them because you didn't do the whole building the top would go from whatever  it was 110 down to about 95 and the guys would get in it was about eight feet long and about 18 inches  wide was it was it rope was it like it blocked off so you couldn't look out or you could look out oh  you could look out it was just a you know an expanded metal grid and you'd stand on it and they 
[00:23:00]  would go down and wash the windows and it was windy as hell and scary as hell so you went from the top  to the how what did you do i went about two stories down we were doing a video story on it no way i  wouldn't be able to do that i couldn't either no effing way i didn't know people went on those i always  thought that they were unmanned window washing no not robotic they had little folks on them  cleaning those windows i would how come because the guy who ran them on 9-11 i think was was killed  but i was wondering why didn't he try to use them to go down or is it just nowhere i don't i wonder  why he didn't try to use them to get out there was a guy washing windows on the no no but i'm saying 
[00:23:30]  like the guy who was in charge of those i believe i forget his name was killed oh you're thinking he  should have put him in into operation or just for himself tried to get down but you couldn't go all the  way down they only went through certain sections of the building because you couldn't do 110 stories of  those cables it would have been too much oh my god that's unbelievable maybe yeah i don't know i  was wondering why he didn't use that to get out speaking of which jimmy anthony look look who that  is there's a picture i'm showing everybody it'll be up on onaradio.com if it's not in your paper 
[00:24:00]  uh we we've been following this guy for for quite a while since since it happened late last year  remember the guy who fell 47 stories with his brother yeah uh the two window washers the brother  died and the other guy was in a coma we followed the story for a while remember they had to open up  his chest to to allow the the whole chest cavity to swell remember all that all his organs were swollen 
[00:24:30]  well in the paper today there's a there's a picture of him walking his little doggy the guy is  completely fine they said the only injury he's got is a huge scar on his calf and and and excuse me  an obvious uh limp but besides that he's in good health for falling uh 47 stories that's amazing  he's in good health he was walking his little doggy with his wife yesterday a walking miracle window  washer uh i'm not even gonna tempt the name uh amazed doctors by surviving a 47 story plunge from the upper 
[00:25:00]  east side high rise in december is now astounding his neighbors as he looks like any other guy out  walking his dog in his new jersey neighborhood a limp and a long scar and gash on his left calf are the  only signs the only signs of the horrific fall that killed his brother also a window washer and  they're they're thinking that um the the the apparatus that he was in hit on an angle and that kind of  like cushioned cushioned the impact okay just enough for him to you know to survive this damn thing and  the wind they said and the wind possibly made it like yeah kind of um slow down a little sure but

[00:27:00]  probably gotta be 10 20 people i'll agree with that actually  and we're gonna wrap up our scared of heights section we've been doing here today because this  story hit uh this morning and i read about this in the paper yesterday listen to this a 29 year old  man from schenectady jumped from a plane that was flying at 10 000 feet in the air and he landed on a  house in duanesburg now state police say he told the skydiving club he just wanted to take some 
[00:27:30]  pictures but then he unhooked his seatbelt and dove out john craig has this morning's top story  this guy wasn't a jumper he just wanted to go for an observer ride that observer ride resulted in this  29 year old sloan carafalo falling 10 000 feet hitting this house on duanesburg road state troopers say  that it came during a routine flight from the duanesburg skydiving club a student jumped with his  instructor followed by a skydiving videographer who was there to tape the first timers jump just before 
[00:28:00]  the door was shut carafalo jumped out and took a picture of himself as he did wow he said the  videographer actually caught the incident on tape that tape is now with police oh god we gotta see  that tape come on get it online he killed himself dude yeah he lived when they said he onto a house  i thought it was a jump no no i mean no parachute he went up everyone else was jumping with a parachute  and just as the doors were about to close he said ah what the hell and he took a picture  and he ran and and jumped out of the plane without a parachute to kill himself are there any pictures 
[00:28:30]  or videos online of that or no what a mess that must have made when he hit that house there you go  oh what a mess someone's gonna have to sell their house too many memories now hitting all those ceiling  trusses and and it must have just been ripped to shreds right through the shingles but you want to  know like if you when you're falling 10 that imagine if he jumped and a half second after like because i  don't know what happens when you jump like that yeah yeah like his mind cleared you went oh my god  i didn't need to do this what am i doing what and then you have 9999 more feet to go i think it's to 
[00:29:00]  think about it i think it's more like anthony all of a sudden you're just like what anthony said what  what am i doing what am i doing i'm plummeting i don't have a shoot you try to fashion one out of  your shirt oh by the way this is what you do hold on your sleeves maybe this will slow me down enough  uh erec's got the picture up we can put this up on ona radio wow did he wreck that house that's  what a body does to a roof hey that's pretty impressive that is impressive that's a nice 
[00:29:30]  chunk of the roof uh missing throw that up on ona radio.com oh by the way we update ona radio.com  as the show goes on so that'll be up there in a few seconds hey uh big brown we started the show by  saying he was a bust he did not uh win the triple crown obviously uh he came in dead last out there on  long island and the only reason we play this clip is because his jockey sounds like a leprechaun  it's the only reason they all have that weird voice listen this guy can tell us what happened  well i was him take us through the race uh he was keen to go on early i just wanted to assume 
[00:30:00]  what way represent hell way represent he was keen to go on early i just wanted to assume he slipped  again he breaks so hard you know it's hot as hell out there and the racetrack didn't hold him up he  slipped up front and this time stumbled a little bit so they just tried to slide to the outside and  get a nice position it looked like he was fighting you a little bit early in the race yeah he was keen  but i mean i got him out early and we just cantered along down the backside there was a couple times 
[00:30:30]  where he he thought it was time to go and jumped into the bridle but by the time we long before we  went into the last turn i had no horse had no horse i had no horse how's he doing running down the  track kind of must have looked silly i think it was an old bugs bunny uh cartoon where the jockeys just  kind of has no horse anymore he had no horse no horse so a lot of people uh lost money on big brown  over the weekend yeah i'm sure a lot of people love betting the favorite and the celtics two games 
[00:31:00]  up on the lakers who saw that coming who saw that coming uh you apparently oh yeah  oh yeah i'm so used to being a loser with i know well that's right i did see this coming it's not over  i saw this coming see what happens see how shocked i was yeah you didn't even realize you said this 
[00:31:30]  no dan in albany what's up you know that guy who jumped out of the plane yeah when he hit the house  his body split in half and the homeowner was standing there saw the whole thing go down  wow that would annoy the crap out of me especially since there's no way they could have listed that  in your insurance policy yeah body plummeting into roof hey thank you dan as you listen to yourself  and then someone else said that the how did the camera survive the fall  took a picture of himself maybe he left maybe he set the camera for two seconds and just ran and 
[00:32:00]  jumped was it on the plane seriously maybe he took a picture of himself and threw the camera back in  the plane before he oh come on that would be a hell of a shot yeah it is a good shot you'd have to  bye bye bye did he wave just bye did the camera survive well he took a picture of a picture of  himself while holding it or i don't know i don't know they never give you enough details i don't  know we're extremely bad listeners what what do you rock sometimes um they have a camera in the  helmet so you can tape it as you uh as you jump out yourself yeah but he didn't have a helmet no he 
[00:32:30]  wasn't he wasn't supposed to be jumping he didn't have a shoot oh wait nothing i know what you're  saying what do you mean to tell explain what you mean i know i screwed up jimmy tries so hard he's  very very good at it too no no explain explain what you mean we know well the thing is that the  cameras on on on jumpers yeah they will have a stick of videotape but a man who just decides to  throw himself out without a yeah yeah i think he's all in all the regalia we got an ongoing theme 
[00:33:00]  today it's very very hot in new york and look see hazy hot human of course you got the three h's  today yeah um the cw reports on what to do in the heat oh cool well uh well that's good it's very  informative i'm glad i'm glad they're doing that shut up can i guess uh it's gonna be things like  i try to stay cool um uh some ice get into an air-conditioned place when you can when you can 
[00:33:30]  check on any elderly relatives yeah um because which is always helpful yeah because for some  reason instinct dictates but i put on my burlap hat in weather like this and it never works out  people are like why are you wearing mittens jim and i'm like what oh we should do a light clothing  right we should do a hacky bit today we should get someone like in a snowsuit just to walk down 57th  street just uh to get everyone to drop dead well and the the shock of uh of of the tours as they 
[00:34:00]  see someone in a in in a full skiing outfit look at this guy what's he doing he's crazy can we get  this done today it's gonna be hot tomorrow too can we get this done but it has to be something  completely ridiculous and warm looking what do you suggest i just i don't um i don't know  intern survival not all the interns in parkas now we just need one because i want to get i want  to see all the dumb rubes from all over the country just like in shock like they've never 
[00:34:30]  seen anything like this before taking pictures and we're doing more for the reaction of the dumb  tourists than actually doing the bit so we need some ridiculous outfit for tomorrow what do you think  jimmy oh no just something hot sweaters well just lots of sweaters a sweatshirt with a hood  homeless people it's not as weird here as it would be in the summer it is true homeless people wear that  all the time they're they're all nuts yeah they'll just think it's some homeless bum yeah hey bum bum 
[00:35:00]  well this is the cw reporting on what to do because it's so hot out today very helpful they're just  hoping it doesn't end up being a sweltering day wherever you are the key thing is to drink lots  of fluids and well do like i do have an open collared shirt try to cover your skin as best  as you can and wear lighter colors because this is simply going to be a scorcher  fluids are good i guess fluids are good on a day like fluids and light clothing and cover your skin 
[00:35:30]  do like i do grab a hooker what was he saying i don't know do like i do wear an open collared shirt  yeah well you know i have a checklist and i i one time it was uh i was 102 out and i accidentally  grabbed my winter checklist oh see that's trouble i was 20 minutes into my day and i realized i was 
[00:36:00]  over dressed  check on elderly relatives why yeah let's get let's go to jeff in jersey with uh with uh something on  jumping jeff what's up hey it's jeffy um what little jimmy was saying you know he's wondering  what went through the guy's head after he jumped out of the plane you guys had the director  from that movie the bridge on and he actually interviewed a guy in there that survived jumping  off the golden gate bridge and he said as soon as he left the um the bridge he realized that he 
[00:36:30]  shouldn't have done it and like that i guess some sort did we ever replay that interview  one of the most amazing interviews we ever did a guy who jumped off the golden gate bridge and uh  survived and we had him on the phone i think he's one of the only ones that ever survived or  something like that what a douche and it was that whole documentary where a guy with this this ghoul  uh set up two or three cameras at the golden gate bridge for a year just let him run and and and 
[00:37:00]  caught many many people jumping yeah off uh off the bridge really brilliant it was a really creepy  movie it's not for everybody though because you really do see people just going up on the rail and  ending their lives one guy just falling backwards that was the worst the one going backwards yeah they  showed him yeah and they showed interviews with the people and their families it was really  interesting they set it up they told the city they were doing this to study traffic patterns  and um because people jump every year it's one of the biggest suicide spots in the country it's 
[00:37:30]  such a legendary bridge right and he just caught mostly on remote but they would film people from  the ground walking like they would see people pacing and they actually caught people uh just  jumping it was yeah they said after a while they were able to just tell just by someone the way  they walked on the bridge that they were going to jump yeah they're looking around kind of looking  at the railing so they'd zoom in on them and just wait uh let's say hi to steve in jersey steve what's  up hey there steve hey guys good morning the way the camera works when the guy jumps out of the plane 
[00:38:00]  is that the memory card of the camera is so far inside the plastic casings that they find the memory  cards feet and feet away from where the camera actually landed and they're able to put it into a computer  and get the pictures off that way yeah but that's true a couple different times so why can't we  like uh i don't know build like something that looks like a camera so we would survive a fall  you all sit in giant cameras in planes now and if it crashes you get tossed a little ways but you're 
[00:38:30]  okay yeah because the camera camera takes the brunt of the punishment destroys uh thank you sir  uh all right we're gonna take a break almost one person per second dies every day  no it's gotta be more than that one a second how many seconds in a day a lot of freaking people  actually another stat now says 1.8 people per second and there's uh quite a few 60 times 60 times 24 
[00:39:00]  it's all right let's get a hold of us is that gross not net right because they you know but then the  they don't add in the birth rate the birth rate is better than the death rate so we're we're still  going up we're gonna fix that six billion people yeah we need to go down for a few decades start  doing like the uh spartans and tossing a few of these kids off the cliff would they do that oh yeah 
[00:39:30]  why they would look at the kid and if it wasn't uh physically fit or had any abnormalities  they'd heave it off a cliff into a pile of dead babies that weren't quite you know up to par  didn't you watch 300 it was great no is that good oh god you gotta see three the 300 really 300  was amazing muscle men scantily clad i'll buy i'll buy the hot movie i'll buy it on blu-ray it's  great a blu-ray it looks amazing they they painted in that the uh the ab muscles of of the spartans 
[00:40:00]  did they i think so it's creepy i don't know guys are like i think they work out a little bit yeah  it was just creepy it was uh no it was pretty good but they did show how you know in ancient sparta  they would do that they'd hold up the kid like one guy would kind of just take a look at him and  you know anything abnormal or if he was a little wee kid a little too small  boom right off the cliff it must have sucked like walking in ravines back then 
[00:40:30]  yeah you got the damaged kids you got virgins all this all kinds of crazy stuff going on you're  just trying to go for a little hike in a ravine and there's just dead bodies everywhere  what do they do they're just well what happened i don't know if they're wearing big hulk gloves on  the news it's not the news i know you're i know you and jill are an item but that's not the news  come on look at this they're playing with hulk dolls 
[00:41:00]  great  look at his treadway is just like great can't afford those he can't take it  fight back and use alternative ways of course ride a bike because gas prices are officially  the average went up to four dollars actually uh it's yeah eighty seven dollars a gallon now  well it's it's 450 460 in a lot of places but the average is officially over four dollars for the 
[00:41:30]  entire country that's that's unbelievable i finally cracked the hundred dollar mark on  filling my tank up in my uh my truck hundred bucks it's like 108 dollars that's unbelievable  all right when we get back anthony went to nashville we'll talk about that a little bit  sure did and we'll also talk about uh the fine animation festival we had at the roseland ballroom  last thursday where could they see the animation excuse me animations i don't know i mean i know  that they're gonna be on itunes today uh they were on a site but everybody complained that the server 
[00:42:00]  which was not our doing uh the server was too slow and it was extremely slow it just sucked it was a  major issue because we did the animation festival and then the the animations were supposed to be up  on the server on thursday night and nothing but complaints it took forever to to get to the  animations i know right now if you uh pop in opian anthony animations on youtube you can start there  and at least uh see some of the animations from the animation festival and then sometime today they're  all going to be available on itunes in a nice nice clean package for everybody okay itunes is weird 
[00:42:30]  the way they have a download i've downloaded episodes of shows and uh likely i finally saw the  last three lost and they're easy to download high quality there i don't know how they do it so well  yeah i know youtube quality sucks man itunes is great oh yeah i push people to youtube just so  you can at least right see some of these animations if you want a really nice copy i'm sure uh the way  to go is uh itunes later today so you got two options is what i'm saying but how come they're so 
[00:43:00]  good on itunes and what do they do that's so different than like the server we had up is it just  a bigger server not compressed like uh well like youtube yeah youtube has they're getting five  billion videos they got to worry about all over the world and and itunes kind of keeps it uh  you know it keeps they keep their numbers down but they have movies and everything you can download  quickly and dvd quality yeah so there i'm watching it on uh that itv yeah you have mac tv yeah oh i like  it i have it too i haven't hooked it up eatman gave it to us for christmas a couple years ago

[00:44:00]  i don't need i don't need to i don't need itv simple as that i do i know you're a tech guy i'm a  basic i'm basic basic guy how big is it what am i what am i doing i don't ask you this time  i listen uh opie and anthony animations on youtube so you can take a peek at uh some of the animations  we did or showed uh uh on uh thursday night and then later today they'll be up on itunes if you  want a really nice copy okay but if you have itv you could download them on itunes and watch them  on your regular tv yes yes yeah see we'll talk about the animation festival i got some audio from

[00:47:00]  capsule or whatever it is i like time machine better it's a delorean doc brown takes you around  it's cool it's fun there's a lot of back to the future references on this show if you listen closely  yes when the hell did that start and uh bob kelly's in uh bobby's in the studio today robert kelly and  you were saying there's a new blackberry there's a new blackberry called thunder thunder and there's  another one thunder oh there's another one coming out too uh i forget what it's called the some some  of the big name what is it a blackberry it's a blackberry blackberry it's like a black there's a 
[00:47:30]  blackberry that looks like a everything looks like the iphone now yeah that samsung sprint just came  up with their cheesy looking iphone they're really trying touch screen the whole thing they call them  blackberry uh iphone killers yeah yeah okay sure but uh phone number eight seven seven two one two  one day quite killing the iphone blackberry will probably do at least a decent job you didn't say  it right jimmy i don't know how to say it blackberry that company will probably do uh i can't 
[00:48:00]  just try it it's better than blackberry blackberry i uh i don't know about that one i can't do it  i know it's not supposed to sound cool it's supposed to sound obnoxious it sounds beyond  obnoxious if you have a blackberry give me a call it's soul hurting because it hurts the inside of  my nose robert kelly was one of the judges uh during the animation festival yes and the latest update 
[00:48:30]  you know i really thought for once we had a perfect event followed by a a perfect follow-up right uh we were  supposed to go on the air monday and go here you go guys if you weren't at the animation festival go  here to see all the animations right easy uh well now i'm hearing that uh itunes is having a problem  with the way we sent them the animations so now we have to wait till tomorrow uh but they are up on  youtube we send them in feces what's the problem but they're all over the place on youtube i guess if 
[00:49:00]  you type in opian anthony animations you'll you'll get most of them most of them from the animation  festival on that high quality youtube uh video no kidding see right someday we'll have it all  figured out you do the animation festival you take friday off and then monday morning you go on the air  at six o'clock and you go go here to see him yep but right now go here and maybe here and over here  to see him and then maybe tomorrow we'll have a better uh copy or quality copy for everybody 
[00:49:30]  there's plenty of time no kidding no effing kidding if they sent it in in time is it possible that uh  itunes messed up or that they didn't it didn't get to it in time they could never mess up okay fair  enough see they have to the people that work for the show have to have the club sort of kenny mentality  kenny will check double check and triple check the most basic stuff to make sure it's it's gonna 
[00:50:00]  happen you know that's what we have to do you can't assume that itunes is gonna do the right  thing you know when you assume you just can't assume thank you you make an asu out of me  what do you guys think of the animation festival um i liked it yes i didn't agree with the final  winner though i did not no no i didn't uh i did not agree with the final judging but again this  i didn't either which one did you think should have won robert kelly i i thought um i like the 
[00:50:30]  tom brokhoff one actually i thought it was the funniest and it had i mean the thing is though  is that it was tom brokhoff oh what's his name brokhoff you had it right i'm saying what even the  newscaster yeah whatever the one was jimmy's passive aggressive little worm isn't he just the worst  just bugs you that that little worm actually went to school that's the only thing he has  i dropped out of high school no he didn't you she couldn't have you could have you're a uh a savant  i went up in rehab rehab and dropped in high school you're a serial killer savant is what you are but 
[00:51:00]  i'm not i'm not i'm not an educated man look if you're you're you're educated you're very educated  but not just will they say he was an educated man he was a wise he was a wise man no but they'll  say he knew technology sorry tom brokhoff what i i thought that one should have won really yeah  that one i thought it was because but you guys didn't you guys should have done you had so many  of them you should have done uh best animation uh the one that has you know incorporates everything 
[00:51:30]  the animation the show categories yeah categories because there was some that the animation looked  like you know a retard right yeah i mean did it but it was actually funny and then some of the  animation was unbelievable but it wasn't as funny as some of the other ones well it was our first  shot at it and um it was a huge success and we live and learn and i think we're gonna do another  one in the fall yeah you should do we're not gonna wait a year that's crazy we're gonna try to do one  in the fall that's a good point though wait the categories like the best the best animation i would 
[00:52:00]  say the most money should go to the best animation because that's the most physical work and the funniest  um gets a smaller prize but that's a good point man because i i thought the best one  was the uh steve the bear no i like that one but i like the uh the slaughterhouse one simply because  oh that's far as yeah a movie quality it looked like pixar good yeah this guy did a it was pretty  much pixar to jimmy's slaughterhouse rant and it was just the the animation itself was so great but it 
[00:52:30]  wasn't the funniest one and we made we made that was twice though that was they had two of those  that was a mistake we shouldn't we should have no it really wasn't a mistake we kind of wanted to  show you two different versions of the same bit i thought that was interesting to a lot of people  but that's unfair to the other one that wasn't pixar i thought it was unfair one that was pixar  because the laughs that people might have gotten or the anytime you hear something twice  it's almost like yeah we just heard that you tune out a little bit yeah um  that's like voss's act why nothing but that was the only uh i mean the good news is the animators 
[00:53:00]  could have animated anything and that was the only one that had uh you know two animations for so  why does uh nathaniel look like crap what are you talking about what i was saying oh you mean mike  that's not right oh i thought it was then i thought i didn't know i developed a meth habit over the  weekend wow poor stunt brain stunt brains uh one of the muckety mucks around here now yeah i actually 
[00:53:30]  got an email from one of the fans that i read yesterday and i that was really bummed out that  they weren't in it is it really you should have you know what and you don't want to hold on yes i'm  sorry to interrupt you babo it was it the same guy that's he did the party scene the clown thing yeah  yeah he's dude let it go oh my god that guy is so angry he's emailing everybody he emailed eric  logan i had explained to eric logan we looked at all the animations and it didn't make the cut  no it sucked but you should there's a few of them that did not make the cut that are now up on uh 
[00:54:00]  you know some of these websites plus the fact that it was ridiculously long and we told long we told  everyone if you if you want your animation shown at the animation festival you got to make sure  it's at a reasonable length that thing went on forever and the audio was horrible it was i i didn't  even get it it was apparently east side dave when he came in as the clown right character which is a  one-off right so the clown right like 99 of the people aren't even going to understand what the 
[00:54:30]  hell's happening in it i didn't understand i'm watching this going what the hell is this crap  well that's what you should have though you guys a douche with going to show you should take  the crappiest ones not show them but just have a winner for the crappiest offers he the one  just have enough with that guy yeah dude you're annoying everybody i gave me you really are  annoying everybody because like we we went out of our way to make sure we effed you we made a  decision and and you don't like the decision tough you were deal with it you were not in the top 
[00:55:00]  five okay top five you weren't in the top 20 it was not we showed 20 animations you make the top 20  watch watch american idol watch the beginning when some idiot gets up there and actually thinks he can  sing and they goof on him and he leaves crying and mad that was you did you just compare the  animation festival american idol yeah because it's the same thing the guy sometimes people actually  think they're really good they suck everyone knows they suck except them and then you're just 
[00:55:30]  that's what this guy was he sucked and then you're embarrassing yourself by emailing everybody  everybody and everyone's taking a closer look at it and going what is this guy thinking that's the  one you think should have won over the pixar one mind i say post it it's it's there it's with all  the other animations take a look there was an elliot spitzer one that we never we didn't even show  that i thought was really really funny it was quick it was like 20 30 seconds but i thought i thought  it was very well done yeah and very very funny that one didn't make the cut either for whatever 
[00:56:00]  reason god that guy and i sent him back an email a nice one i had to like i had to deal with that  yesterday with logan because he's writing me he's like you know and i had explained to him why this  guy's animation didn't make the animation it was didn't they show it at the festival or no  no i thought they did no because it was it was too long and and and because people only hear half  of what we say on this radio show it was too long and it wasn't good enough oh that's why because he  asked me uh like how come it didn't do well at this point where i looked at my camera and i'm like i 
[00:56:30]  must have missed that one but then i remember i had seen it but on the dvds we had yeah i saw it  yeah we all we sat around as a group we looked at every animation and we made uh some tough decisions  that one honestly wasn't a tough decision it was like this thing stinks horrid as far as what we're  looking for hated it so stop emailing everybody and stop trying to get threads uh together on  message boards and stuff just just deal with it it wasn't good enough yeah you really are dude  you're coming off like uh someone who sour grapes sour grapes why else wouldn't people show it you think 
[00:57:00]  anyone was out to get you i thought steve the bear was uh that was great unbelievable  and it had just made everyone just happy and warm inside it had kind of a hannah barbara uh barbara  oh hannah barbara and tom brokhoff right next on the idiot idiot show  hannah barbara type of feel to it the blade one was hysterical i thought oh was he 
[00:57:30]  that was probably my favorite one yeah because it was just hysterically funny hey man yeah  why don't you just go to your blade lair it's hysterical and uh potty talk was really really  good and surprisingly uh um jimmy and i's uh fight that was actually very the animation on that was  amazing yeah really and they turned like a very uncomfortable moment for the radio show into  something really funny really that was just how they animated the damn thing that was right actually 
[00:58:00]  that was uh one of my second favorites i like that one which one the fight the fight yeah absolutely  absolutely so uh you could go to uh opie and anthony animations on youtube to see them and put that  link up on onaradio.com for now you know what's good too though when you actually showed one of the  guys uh what was his uh uh coke logic yeah you should have uh you should have brought those guys on  stage at the end all the people and let them you know what i mean because that was a bask in their  celebrity just what a mess we would have that guy you know you think of coke loud you think of some 
[00:58:30]  thin dude with glasses but he's just a you know a triple x we putt baseball wow we would have if we  had a stage to maneuver on it was like on a on a ledge yeah we were on a ledge we were on the ledge  you know how uncomfortable that is there wasn't much stage you couldn't try to couldn't fit five  ona fans on the ledge hell no the stage couldn't have been more than what four feet wide yeah because  they had to like lower the big huge screen at the roseland ballroom it was really uncomfortable you 
[00:59:00]  felt like you couldn't really move at all and a monitor backstage would have been nice yeah we got  one monitor so we could actually watch the videos when we were backstage we couldn't see what was  going on we're hearing things and hearing laughter and going ah i'd like to know what they're laughing  out there yeah nothing what what okay uh yeah well we got some tweaking to do but we're gonna do  another one of these in the fall absolutely so we got to get it together and i think we're gonna  get the prize money a lot higher i think uh i think we might have categories like robert kelly 
[00:59:30]  suggesting and also i think it would be kind of cool instead of us coming on stage after every  animation maybe we have some of the players of the radio show coming out and intro on the next  animation all of a sudden you have big a or roland or or east side dave whoever yeah comes out and uh  you know an intro is the next animation just to keep it a little more interesting and you should  get hot chicks we tried ring girls yeah we really tried really yeah what happened i don't know  well you couldn't get a hot chick this is an opening anthony show exactly no the hot chicks left this 
[01:00:00]  show freaking years ago look around we have a stripper pole that has cobwebs on it please look at  that it's pristine there's not one fingerprint you could dust it for prints you won't find one  look at this stripper pole it's now being used for storage yeah there's extension cords drop lights  it's a fat guy treadmill yeah that's what it is the fat guy treadmill just covered with goods it's  just a place to put stuff what happens they've run out of like storage in this building can't we go 
[01:00:30]  in that direction a little bit yeah we can love to let's try what are you gonna do uh what else  did you look at that anything you want to play yeah i mean there was some funny i'm sorry there's some  funny uh the stuff you highlighted was i thought the right stuff up all right let me uh let me take a  look we got some audio from the open anthony animation just because um we can't get enough  of them we had roland come out and you know say hi to everybody to start off the animation festival  and the deal here is we had danny sneaking from underneath the the screen to tickle roland as

[01:08:00]  in nashville that's what that's how you do this thing that was such a 70s thing that show wide world  of sports that evil just sit there yeah yeah one week it'd be like a frisbee competition  and then evil knievel and ski jumping it's just a whole cluster f of sports it was sports slash fear  factor yeah yeah it incorporated everything because we only had three or four channels back 
[01:08:30]  then so like a sport variety show yeah it's pretty much what it was you never knew what you were gonna  get my favorite one ever was the guy that uh you know caught the the bullet in his teeth oh really  that was my favorite of all time what again a boxing ring right that's a gag though yeah i know  but he had metal teeth they explained how he had to get all his teeth pulled out and they had metal  teeth in and he had a metal cup behind in the back of his mouth to catch the bullet blah blah blah  they had a a frisbee dog competition once and it was like at the los angeles coliseum which was packed 
[01:09:00]  just for frisbee dogs people had nothing to do back then because we didn't have iphones  we didn't have cell phones we didn't have the internet so we had to like interact with people  of course oh the barrel jumper dumbest sport ever why would you jump over barrels because all right  you know why barrel jumping so dumb because after like uh 18 barrels oh my god that is a wide world  of sports i'll just talk to a wall sorry i'll just talk to a wall i was listening i was listening

[01:10:00]  fry oh i want to punch her in the mouth maybe they just had a good time i just want to be in the know  update us  update us  well after the animation festival you went down there to nashville tennessee for the uh  country music festival i think yeah it was like the uh yeah whole country uh music um awards and 
[01:10:30]  festival they have a big thing down there last about a week so you like country music  oh well you know i i'm a big fan of um uh country music  no actually i don't know much about country music at all are you gonna get are you gonna get jill to  go to one of those uh fairs with you when you dress up with a sword what a renaissance festival  she gonna go with you it's probably would yeah it's a good egg you think that hot chick's gonna  dress up and go play with you to theater in the woods with you play huh robin hood 
[01:11:00]  i don't play in the woods it's called larping i don't larp i've never larped a day in my life  no larping for me but if you're gonna wear the costume you might as well larp now you just kind  of walk around just walk around in costume yeah i did that once did it once but you larped no  walk around in costume with the big renaissance fair and ate the big turkey uh leg no i hate the 
[01:11:30]  big turkey leg it's all dark i had steak on a steak oh there you go steak on a steak yeah yeah  they put a little steak they put a stick through it and called steak on a steak everything's got to  have some kind of you know renaissance-y sound to it did you have somebody fix your armor while you  were there the blacksmith didn't need it the old village smithy yeah ting tang ting tang ting  no so how was nashville oh well here's my observations of uh nashville during this whole 
[01:12:00]  thing uh i've never seen a a larger concentration of drunks in in all my life um and they all carry  guns right uh no no no you can't carry down there no you can but you got to go through a rigorous um  training and uh licensing thing like you do here in new york nashville yeah tennessee the state of  tennessee when i used to go down to dallas with jimmy i mean they just dallas is different yeah  dallas is texas pretty much you get a car and a gun at the same time you get your driver's license 
[01:12:30]  and they hand you over a gun like here you go you pass the test this is our little gift to you  tennessee is different but i did not know that they do have a reciprocity between new york and uh  tennessee with gun license so i uh you know i like being secure so i i uh go to uh the airport  uh with my gun and my in my suitcase you know what gun little ammo brought your gun to to a country  festival well no i was gonna but it would have taken too long so we got to the airport at a certain time 
[01:13:00]  and uh i i didn't have enough time for the port authority to give me the proper paperwork and  everything to fill out so i had to give it back to keith and you know he took it home but i i would  have yeah why not why not because i i i protect myself i'm i believe in the second amendment you  shouldn't be allowed to do that that's a security risk what listen to me it's not on the snake goes  through that let's say it goes through goes through the luggage place right somebody who is in 
[01:13:30]  cahoots let's say you and a friend want to hijack that plane your friend somehow works  uh for the people who put luggage on the thing you tell him where your luggage is going to be he  arranges to get your gun out of that luggage and somehow get it to you back on that plane that's  not that far-fetched a scenario why couldn't he just bring a gun with him because he probably has  to go through security to get in they go through security to get near the plane use anthony let's say 
[01:14:00]  anthony want to hijack a gun inside the luggage no what do i go through the check bobby works for  the airline i do and uh so bobby knows anthony's luggage they prearranged this he goes into anthony's  luggage he gets out the gun so he's got to get the uh gun that's in a locked box however he does it  if it's possible to do it it can be done and the ammo that's in a separate well i'd have a key if i  was your friend you'd give me a key i'd give you a key i'd go get that pink suitcase undo it get the box  out undo it put it in my thing and then go put it under your seat or i know your seat or just go 
[01:14:30]  on for something else uh or just walk in the door it's secure they're allowed to walk in uh those  people who work and they can walk in like you know the alarm doors by the gate you can walk in there  meet you in the bathroom and hand you the gun so now you have a gun on the plane some terrorist in  jersey right now just listening to the show went wow that's a great idea thanks jimmy and i also  noticed this security lapse too i was in newark airport i was in one of those stores where you  where you uh i was buying like a movie and the guy took a straight razor a box cutter and opened up my 
[01:15:00]  package for me to hand me the uh it's like how are box cutters getting into those that's how the next  security breach is going to be it's going to be one of those stupid store stores in the airport that  someone's going to get a pistol sell things no i don't mind them but they're not secure enough  so i'm giving this gun thing away because they should stop it i don't know i what if you want to  transport a gun somewhere too bad you do it on fedex or not a commercial airliner too bad the  right of a person to transport a gun they won't not override the right of the past they won't they 
[01:15:30]  won't they won't ship a gun i don't think whatever i'm just saying you know how about cousin frank put  it in his hat how about how about your illegal hand licensed and gun owner because you have to show  your license so anyway you know muhammad atah showed his real passport i don't think muhammad atah would  have been able to get a pistol yeah listen he's he's actually gonna he's gonna go in you're gonna  meet the port authority you're gonna fill a document everybody knows documents that that gun is on the  plane i'm just saying there's a way to do it there's a way that's how they do it there's a way to get 
[01:16:00]  there's a way to beat the system all beat the system and arrange for it to uh to be in the hands  of somebody else because box cutters will never work again but a gun would work and then the terrorists  win because uh i can't uh carry in another state do pretty good winning and anthony they crash a  plane that's a pretty anthony needs his gun in nashville jimmy you can allow that never know you  never know then how about like those cars what are those little cars uh where you can just go and  get the car take the keys and put it in it's like this little weird smart car yeah how about yeah 
[01:16:30]  how about that how about like a smart gun or a sim gun where you can go down there and rent a gun  yeah i don't mind you renting a gun well that would be nice yeah a rental gun for the week  that would be a hell of a business he just goes down to nashville goes to the store picks out a  gun he wants yeah like and i gotta bring it back yeah like you rent a car that'd be great just rent  a gun so there was no reason to be armed all right we're trying to get our nashville update from  anthony everyone was being fun so a lot of drunks and a lot of goddamn bands that want to make it in 
[01:17:00]  country playing at all these bars you every single bar had bands playing in it and they all were  playing country music and a lot of them uh were pretty good you know good voices everything like  that you could tell a good country band from a bad country oh yeah yeah just like anything else  you walk into a bar and see a rock band you know when one sucks i could tell the guys can't play  or sing and you know like a good one i could tell good rock from bad rock i don't think i could 
[01:17:30]  tell good country from bad country now when some guy's singing off key or the harmony suck or the  guitarist blows you know when that is happening it doesn't matter what the genre of music is  uh that's what i'm talking about like i can't say like wow this would be a hit country song you know  i have no idea so this is your idea this you just say hey jilla i want to go do country that was your  idea no jilla likes country music oh no okay so she went down you know to nashville and i went with her  right okay oh so what is that what oh oh am i am i whipped does that make me whip because i decided 
[01:18:00]  let's take a fun little trip down in nashville where we can just wander we went from bar to bar  down broadway had a great time that's not what i'm saying i'm saying that it's good that you  actually love somebody so much that you're going to open yourself up to new and experience new  wonderful it's not like i told her to get a strap on i went to see some bands in a bunch of bars  mark the day it's not fun anymore mark the day june 9 2008 why wouldn't you tell her to go get 
[01:18:30]  one you know you're too homophobic that's your problem how else are you gonna learn your lessons  no not mark the day it's mark the day you're you're getting more defensive which is no i'm just  getting defensive because i'm not uh it's not like i see where bobby's going with this no i i i'm  just glad listen to me dude you're taking this all wrong you are so what i'm saying right now  no not really dude i'm saying that dude you you don't like country music you would have never went  to see country music this would have never been in your repertoire you're right you're right and 
[01:19:00]  you know what jill comes in a couple months says bang i'm going down to country music and you were  like what i'm gonna i would like to check it out but that's called being in love yeah check it out  sure when you're really in love you start doing some things maybe you wouldn't have done before you  fell in love nothing spells now i'm gonna defend anthony not more than the bible belt  and country music that's fun f u n why i mean seriously but anthony is openly admitting he  would never go to nashville tennessee i wouldn't have done that to hang out with 
[01:19:30]  can't say never country folk can't say never but he did it but let me tell you what we did  it was pretty much a bar crawl it was a lot of fun go in drink met some fans of the show  they uh were uh very excited notice not one comment from the entire studio when you said  bar crawl oh what were you expecting a really really yeah no so we'd go you know from one bar  to another yeah and uh you know gotta get a drink here drink there and uh to buy some trinkets and 
[01:20:00]  stuff like trinkets yeah like little t-shirts that says nashville no but there is a picture that will  uh be online i'm sure soon okay uh that is could be one of the most embarrassing pictures i've ever  taken in my life let me say let me say for the record if it's you and there's a certain type of  hat on your head i'm gonna break a tv over your head where's this picture okay it's worse no where's 
[01:20:30]  this picture it was well right now it's it's on jill's camera okay and and she's going to uh send  it probably to steve and then steve will get it uh up online um it is it is uh me what are you playing  a tub bass we were no no that wouldn't have been as embarrassing either a tub girl it's a tub girl  uh we went into a western attire place oh god and got probably what could be one of the gaudiest 
[01:21:00]  western shirts in this baby blue color uh with with a bunch of designs on it and everything and i put  that on and a a big black cowboy hat and um and she put on some really kind of gaudy western wear and a  hat and we took pictures uh together like that and um it it is so bad i was i was looking going i am 
[01:21:30]  dead when they see this dead and it was all done in good fun i don't own these clothes i did not  purchase the hat i did not bring it back i i took it right off back on the hanger the hat went back in  the hat rack and i was just me  yes exactly nice that is what it looked like i looked like the rhinestone cowboy um what was the 
[01:22:00]  highlight of nashville uh probably sex with jill nicolini  oh we had we had a lot of fun just went around we were like you know there's there's an atmosphere 
[01:22:30]  down there that's pretty funny and a lot of people watching can be done and goofing on a lot of people  and just you know drinking a lot of drinking was going on down there uh yeah it was it was a good  time it was fun f-u-n baby f-u-n it was f-u-n yeah trying on outfits and stuff with your new girl 
[01:23:00]  oh god no seriously that anthony that sounds like a blast seriously honey trying this shirt okay  you're making fun but at the animation festival you were trying to throw your ring away after you  met jill let's uh let's uh let's keep it honest here oh yeah from the balcony you're like who wants  my ring and you're trying to throw it into the crowd i also did that with a four and a half  300 pound girl grabbed my uh the drool and i was like yeah take this take me behind the curtain 
[01:23:30]  i just really think that it's good that you know because anthony in my eyes uh you know you know you  have the wrong perspective of somebody when you meet them you know when i first met anthony i was  like wow this tough italian guy from you know long island guns cars and you know and you know and i  like to see that you know he's got this side to him it's like hey you want to try something new  honey yeah i'd love to what do you got i don't know i just googled nashville and there's a fair  festival going on this weekend yeah i'll check that out i've never i don't really like you know

[01:25:00]  the dukes of hazard museum no i i didn't go to the dukes of hazard museum all right let's go to  syracuse good morning to syracuse by the way joe what's up yeah i think what we're witnessing here  is uh anthony jumping the shark oh shut up what do you mean shut up what do you mean what did he  hang up yeah yeah puss go ahead hang up um jumping the shark first of all saying jumping the shark has  jumped the shark no one says that anymore you're not jumping the shark you're line dancing over the

[01:28:30]  what a twinkle how many days have you guys been uh seeing each other could be up to um 17 or 18 18  all right days 20 days no years they've been in there for 20 years well you know what emotionally  spiritual they probably have this thing exactly this thing is moving forward fast you guys have  really only been dating for that days and that's what i saw doesn't it feel like months yeah i can't  wait for this plane to crash really why is everybody so against this having any type of uh 
[01:29:00]  substance to it really i i really no no are you really saying that to me because you are all  emotionally devoid jackasses all of you really all of you are really are you crazy you you so  you met jill we're both met we're both getting i'm married he's getting married i'm talking about  all right i'm talking about jimmy and bob kelly i'm i have emotion you're out of your mind you are  an emotionless shell of a man you have nothing at the same time because now you pissed off 
[01:29:30]  everybody you were an emotional wreck until you met jill what's wrong with you what are you talking  about you kept your emotions tight before you met jill now all of a sudden you're this is how you  always been are you crazy i didn't keep my emotions ago you were a nightmare i've been very  emotionally i'm supportive too i think it's just everyone talking at the same time bobby is not  supportive i am i'm i'm happy for you i just i hope this plane crashed i can't wait i was talking about  the other plane with the gun that you brought on and i helped you get it in and then they bring any 
[01:30:00]  gun on i i've been with you 14 miserable years and let me tell you something you've been married  jesus you've been married yet you had a long-term girlfriend in 14 years i never  saw you hug kiss or hold hands with with with your significant other now all of a sudden you're  yeah they're doing eskimo kisses right you do little little nose kisses eyelash kisses i see you saw that  you are you still are you is it getting stronger are you happier yes you're gonna be married with a 
[01:30:30]  kid something you were completely against now let me tell you something i told ronnie b this could be  either the greatest thing that happens to you or the worst thing there's no in between my friend  you are all in with a fine hand and we're waiting to see what the what this is if my aces hold up  or someone pulls a house on me this one there is no gray area i gotta say it it's either gonna be the  greatest thing that ever happens to anthony or the worst thing i i have to say that and i think it's 
[01:31:00]  moving forward in an extremely positive way i i think he looked look at man i'm joking around with  anthony but let me tell you something like having somebody in your life that you can look into and  you can love and you can be silly with and you can just you know just you know just be vulnerable  like you've been is an amazing thing and i'm glad that you finally found that in your life that you can  just do an experiment experiment that would use and even though bobby's even though bobby's married he's  he's hoping to get this someday but poor keith by the way that you know dating a woman that has 
[01:31:30]  costume changes is exhausting for everybody uh what's going on with that well she had a little  wine that spilt on her but she spilled wine once again sal and uh that was a good sign sal bumps into  her and and wine went on her dress well she was wearing one dress where it looked like you could  spill wine and no one would know the difference so that was the second one though the second one was  very white very nice and also dating a woman that has her own personal photographer could be a little 
[01:32:00]  exhausting because you got to look good all the time those pictures came out good it's like a why  are you going to sit around and then snap pictures and say oh could you take a picture could you do  this all right without snapping pictures with that said i got an observation after the break and how  many days you have to i would have to let me think 17 18 days 14 hold on oh no you're losing track  you're ready no no i'm not i'm not i'm not that's not because there's there's quite a few going up  oh boy that's not good i'm i'm heading toward 1200 days my friends don't keep it track

[01:33:00]  oh but did you say she walks around she has her own personal photographer  uh i was introduced to someone that is her personal photographer that was for the show  yeah but stupid me i'm imagining i assumed this for the animation festival but i thought it would  be so great if the photographer went with you to nashville and keith had to go with you to nashville  and she's doing costume changes in between the bar crawl no no there were a few you know changes  i'm sure i would say how much luggage went out but oh there was a little little pinky which i like 
[01:33:30]  to call it little pinky little pinky a little pink uh bag yeah and then this giant round wheeled  duffel baggy kind of thing um yeah and then my you know i had one one suitcase oh that's not too bad  it wasn't that bad i gotta go to brian and cherry hill he said put me on real fast uh is this you  brian yes sir all right what's up i was just thinking while on hold when's the last time ant  logged into call of duty four thank you thank you sir thank you you know what you gotta do  get the times and and notice what was he playing a day and then when he met jill how it dropped off

[01:35:00]  see jill nicolini because everyone knew she would be there and she was backstage and we uh we got the  crowd into a frenzy and then and uh anthony didn't want to bring jill nicolini out it was a  little gag we were doing back and forth the acting the acting was just terrific oh academy awards  unbelievable and then um and then the big reveal was jim norton in jill nicolini's dress yeah that  got quite a reaction at the animation festival yeah the people seemed to love it and then i think you 
[01:35:30]  guys were kissing us i kissed him on the cheek we hugged yeah we gave a big hug me and jimmy it was  like a hand back it was nice back hug i think i felt your ass why wouldn't you it was supple through  the address oh yeah you did give a little pinch yeah i gave a little pinch to your ass it feels  juicier since i've been doing the elliptic it's like not bad oh god look at it jimmy's got a nice  a nice cuckoo all right robert he's gonna encourage him he wouldn't think it would be that nice you  think it'd be flat lucky us we get to see jimmy uh part of jimmy naked every week thank you jimmy 
[01:36:00]  hopefully that'll be it for this week i'm gonna fight with the security i've never had oh that  was true oh yeah it was a fist fight yeah they wouldn't let us in really you got no fight with  the guy up front me and patrice the guy uh we were i walked in he's like you gotta get out you gotta  get out patrice was why yeah he totally blew us off went outside then me and patrice aggravated him  for 20 minutes in front of all his friends for an ass yeah no the guys the security at the  roseland i mean uh i'm just amazing what asses a couple of these guys were the one guy this fat 
[01:36:30]  pig i was uh a friend of mine came uh and she showed up and she wanted to come up and just say  hello to people you guys know her and uh just to say hi to people so i go down to get her and i can't  really go out on the floor so i i'm standing when i wave her in and the security goes oh you can't go  back and i understand they got a job to do so i have an all-access pass so i show i'm like no no  she's with me and like well who are you this fat pig with horrible breath if you're listening dude 
[01:37:00]  just brush your teeth you're just i mean i understand physically you're an abomination  but your mouth embarrassing dude guy with a mustache right yeah yeah but it might have been a different  guy no same guy he yelled who the f you same guy was it yeah same for the f you are that's how  eric spelled it i don't even know who the okay i don't even know who the f you are sorry but i was  on the stairs when it was going on yeah that at you uh which i didn't which was okay with me i  made but but once he knew that i was with the show and i told him i was with the show and then i went 
[01:37:30]  to hand her my badge i'm like here just come back with this he's like well then you go well then you  go and um i i can't tell you because he's one of these big fat slobs who thinks that because he's a  big fat slob he's frightening um and so i started cursing him and he throws his arms up this is this is  this is a guy who's supposed to represent the roseland venue right um and he starts because  i even said to him i'm like why are you screaming it's like you weren't scary dude you were fat and  your breath stunk you weren't a scary guy you're just a fat slob and your breath was bad and uh 
[01:38:00]  if i had a gun i would have shot him that's why that's why anthony i don't know how you do it  i'm sure if he had a gun he would have shot me  but it's very it's rare that i see red as badly i knew what he was it's not that rare i knew what  he was no man but i i mean it was like then he's throwing his arms up like come on down his friends  are holding him back it's like what are you oh there was a whole scene but it's almost like what  are you gonna do you interrupt the stairs you fat pig what it's like i can argue with you 
[01:38:30]  and not want to you know what are you doing don't try to show off for your friends you you fat jerk off  yeah don't try to tough guy anybody just do your job and do it properly and when you realize that  but the roseland the venue was great and the rest of security was was really cool they apologized but  that one guy um was just disgusting yeah they all knew that they all knew he was a they all the  other guys when he left were talking crap about him no nobody there he works with likes him yeah 
[01:39:00]  yeah everybody was talking crap about him he was out front he did the same he kicked me and patrice  wouldn't let us in and i was like yeah we're supposed to be on the show doesn't matter i don't have  he told patrice don't even bother as he was walking in wow listen we got to go to eroc because  he's typing but uh you observed this whole thing what happened yeah we were standing on the uh upper  part of the stairs and and right as uh jim was uh getting heated with the guy pete jumped in too  and just started screaming and then all these other guards just came around the uh the entrance to the  staircase and all i heard was p yelling i want to know who your supervisor is and it's like i don't 
[01:39:30]  think you're going to be working here tomorrow and jim's just like just let's just go let's just go  got his guest in but pete just stayed down the reason let's just go is because the guy uh my  buddy uh who was there from hbo had just been brought down the steps so he was actually leaving  and he was waiting for me to talk to him and so i walked away and talked to the guy with hbo  while this fat slob and with horrible breath dude brush your teeth it was embarrassed it was just 
[01:40:00]  cigarettes and fat guy dry mouth there's nothing worse than cigarette fat guy dry mouth breath  let me get a piece of gum no you're fine god that guy i know really irritated me but that's roseland  that's who you have i'm gonna smell my car representing you like that that's the guy you  have and then he knew i was on the show and he saw that i had an all-access pass i told him it's  opie this anthony and myself were on the where and he knew you see the huge screen yeah that's me  it's very obvious i'm one of those guys so instead of being wrong yeah he kept it up like instead of 
[01:40:30]  realizing oh okay this guy could probably bring back a guest i'm like dude i can't go out on the  floor she's with me but he was just one of those one of those little people who was obsessed with  showing power he's like a traffic cop but without the dignity and physical prowess traffic cop but you  were scaring a lot of people they said you turned red and they never saw you like that i was i was  really there's nothing i hate more than some there's really a guy like that who thinks that  he's bigger and he's going to try to be physically intimidated that that makes me it makes me want 
[01:41:00]  to want to pick up a bat with a nail in it i would love to see jimmy with a gun because he would  just pull it i need just bam bam bam you would just blast people i wasn't on a weekly basis i  would i'd love to put a gun on jimmy's horn every time he hit his horn  yeah but it was not it's not fun driving with jimmy no i don't like a guy not it reminds me of  my stepfather billy manchington don't try to get him i don't like a guy that gets in my face that  that really bothers me because what he does is he's one of those guys who he thinks that you're  going to be frightened of because it's in your face yeah and that that makes me very very angry 
[01:41:30]  like it just i hate it was probably me and patrice probably set him up for that though because we he  pushed us out wouldn't let us come in and then he was really rude and i told him i go dude  there's a way to do something you could tell us that hey you can't come in yet give me one sec guys  but he was such a moron with the way he kicked people out then he came out and me you know i was  you know busting with a patrice but you know patrice yeah he actually was like i'm gonna get in  without a pass fatso and he was oh this guy patrice patrice was smashing him so bad and all his 
[01:42:00]  friends were laughing oh that's hysterical patrice was like i want to i want to raise some money i'm  gonna put fifty dollars and we're gonna send this this man on vacation we gotta we gotta get him  some uh some chicks you know he i can't say it on the radio but he was like yeah we need to go  someone run down and get a piece of salmon for him to smell because he hasn't gotten it a long time  he was shaking his legs and his hands just he really was getting angry just shaking patrice looked at 
[01:42:30]  and went look at him he's shaking ah really making a mess i think that's kind of what set him up  get mad who cares and your rage is not frightening oh that's great and we had our passes at that  point so he couldn't say anything it's like we had we could just walk oh is that fantastic so we  chose to stay outside for another 20 minutes and just pound him just we're just laughing at him and  pointing going ah was he in the front though this guy inside this guy was into the guy inside oh yeah 
[01:43:00]  the little guy with the mustache that little guy sweaty i know you're talking about but he wasn't  the guy in the back at the end who of the night there was a guy in the back with a mustache at the  end who was trying to help us get a cab that's what and he was cool no this guy wasn't helping  anybody trust me it was the same guy so getting back to the and he got moved by the way they moved  him the supervisor moved him or whatever moved him away from that area move uh going back to the  pictures of anthony and jill nicolini on stage i got a little observation well that's it you know what  what's the observation i gotta find a good one here now that you gotta gotta get closer pictures 
[01:43:30]  if you have them observation all right keep uh go to some of the all right you're curious no  i don't like observations what's it being observed to be completely honest with you uh there's much  better pictures on whack bag of anthony and jill nicolini well of course on stage  and my observation does come from whack bag i gotta give him credit today yeah yes if you go in 
[01:44:00]  there go down to uh now i'm i'm lost uh i'm lost were they taken down probably not no i'll go to uh  oh my god go to animation contest uh page uh 15 i think  holy crap keep going down why is that monitor off down down oh maybe it was radio gold fans dot com 
[01:44:30]  now i'm all over the place oh my god i want to show you this picture huh someone's got it yeah  all right it was whack bag maybe it was the times all right go there you go there's my observation  yes there's a picture of no filter paul and uh jill nicolini and anthony in the background waving  all right go up right is that the only one all right go to all right go to page 14 you see anything 
[01:45:00]  weird about that picture jim jim norton um no i didn't see paul though i would have liked to have  seen paul all right you you don't see anything weird there okay it's bigger all right go to page 14 now  that was isolated go to page 14 the one with the one and the four iraq it's like csi trust me i'm  getting to something it'll be worth it but what's happening where i know i know obi where we oh iraq are  you panicking on me are you panicking he's falling apart there's another one falling like a cheap tent 
[01:45:30]  maybe it was on the other website oh my god all right go back to the go back to 15  wow that's fine that picture was from the opian anthony animation festival there's a really good  picture of anthony uh and jill nicolini hugging and i see an observation and you see the same  observation in this picture what you see a tear coming out of her eye what it  you i'm kidding she loves me i know she does yeah they say love and everything ready they do 
[01:46:00]  oh i see what you're saying you got it jimmy i'm guessing uh-huh if it's the placing of it  yeah there is a ring on jill nicolini's ring finger whoa  that uh it's more like a wedding band what does it look like wow in that picture uh she's got her  left hand up on uh no filter paul's shoulder and there's a ring on a ring finger and it's it's very 
[01:46:30]  obvious when you guys are on stage together well that would be uh very secretive of me to do something  like that and not tell anybody after 20 days it's not like an engagement ring but it's a ring on a  ring finger and a lunatic would do something like that and i'm just wondering if you had anything  promise and people want to know if you had anything to do with that so don't kill the messenger  i don't think why i didn't start this but uh we're trying to get to the bottom of it why would i feed 
[01:47:00]  into people's speculation by giving any kind of answer i i i don't think uh jill's jewelry and where  it came from is anybody's business tell you the god's honest truth wow that's a weird answer  it is yeah nobody's business like if someone said to me did you put a ring on i go i go no i  didn't and if someone said to alby hey did you put uh the equivalent of the chrysler building on a  girl's left finger he would say yes  almighty she's to keep her hand actually scrapes the ground when that thing is on 
[01:47:30]  wasn't p wasn't inspector clouseau hunting for this  well i was just trying to show my my my happiness some poor hobbled african is sitting there  responsible for that one come out of you you couldn't just tape fifty thousand dollars  on her finger in small bills  times times by the way you should not allow her to wear that 
[01:48:00]  really you should times wow wow what's wrong with you she's got a co-op on her finger  i don't know you should not allow her to wear that to pick out wedding stuff by the way  because they're going to charge her more uh no kidding i found that out wow look at that is that  one of the scams of uh i did find out all right i don't i don't really talk much about this but i'll  tell you this much the other uh last week i went down to the west village uh we had an appointment  uh to look at flowers i didn't want to go turned out all right and they're uh going through the 
[01:48:30]  their portfolio showing us what they could do this and that and we did this and we did that  and look at these flowers pansies compared to this i mean who was showing you the pictures  i heard we were we were definitely looking looking at pansies yes and then all of a sudden we're going  through the uh the portfolio and i see carrie bradshaw uh carrie bradshaw also known as uh  sarah jessica parka with all sorts of flowers and then and then she's she's eating them 
[01:49:00]  and her girls and her girls also have flowers and then there's there's wedding photos and everyone  has flowers and then that's when they told me that they did the flowers for the sex in the city movie  i'm like oh great how much is this going to cost me yeah we're looking at the same flower guys that  did the flowers for the sex in the city movie is it expensive to get a lot of flowers i don't know  yeah why don't you just get a vase full here you go look at these here we go here we go there's uh 
[01:49:30]  there's more people have actually circled it yes that that's the only reason i brought it up because  people are talking about this uh ring on the ring finger of jill nicolini and you know you got you  got the people are talking they're doing extreme close-ups on the ring finger she's holding the  microphone and what was your official answer again at that i said that her jewelry is nobody's business  what what's what who am i to uh be discussing what jewelry she wears well you could speculate 
[01:50:00]  yeah why would i speculate it's a radio show we're all friends speculating anything  why would you put on a weird blue country shirt for no reason yeah and a hat wasn't a written no  reason it was a funny fun picture it's a very funny fun picture uh and and that you know i'll tell  you one thing if you want to get stuff cheap then go to a penn station go to the jewelry store there  and pick out an engagement ring and i bet they give you wedding gowns for uh charity i could have bought 
[01:50:30]  the store so that ring is uh so much for a new car that rings it's all it's all bunk that ring  yeah just a ring that's just a ring she probably wears it to people think she's married they don't  bother a ring or anthony anthony mary doesn't surprise everyone else yeah but you know what they  could have done though jesus christ what what i get myself into jail  for being the last guy that winked at her we're gonna go to break and we're gonna see if anthony 
[01:51:00]  reaches for that iphone that's what we're gonna do let's look at it what the f oh let's see you're  on tv next time oh she's not on today why today i don't like mondays well maybe carson how does  she get off on monday and i think she missed friday too how many days has she missed since  you guys have been dating oh my god she says it's vacation time but yeah it's vacation time i think 
[01:51:30]  they're four days four or five days out of 20 out of 20 she has missed we went to a bowling charity  thing and i got to see everybody they said you didn't smile during the footage tongue was there i guess  they showed the footage and you weren't smiling um well i was kind of serious i was setting up for  my shot you know because jill took you know the bowling ball and and tried to bowl in high heels  which is kind of funny and then uh you know i just whipped the ball down there two strikes in a row 
[01:52:00]  of course they don't show my bowling prowess but that's fine but what i was just kind of standing by  the ball return you weren't smiling i wasn't smiling that's another observation people are studying  you right now what the hell every freaking thing i wasn't even going to bring that to the show but  now that you brought up the bowling i have to but someone said that you weren't smiling during the  bowling segment on channel 11 with jill nicolini that is kind of weird at a charity bowling event  so you're now you're bowling too it was a charity like bowling thing we just showed up real quick 
[01:52:30]  said hi it's cool man saw some what's his name mr g was down there again oh really jesus christ  that guy is just let me just tell you for the record what a creep we have to why we have to  blow up his spot we're we're trying to be nice but you know if he's gonna flaunt all this mr g is  just a filthy man if he's gonna flaunt his stories we gotta blow up his spot i'm sorry you like him  the guy is sure wouldn't that's great he's uh he's an interesting character he's been doing 
[01:53:00]  weather in new york city for i don't even know i think i was in high school when he started  katie tong was down there and um yeah a few of the other big news people like chuck scarborough  i didn't see chuck scarborough so no comment on the ring on the ring finger why would i comment on  something i uh you didn't give it to her so why would you comment uh to comment about maybe you  guys are just at a denny's one of those little crane little toy games and yeah yeah and i craned up  a ring and yeah all right we're gonna take a break uh once again go to youtube opie and anthony

[02:05:00]  oh wow that was great he was he was awestruck couldn't speak yeah well thanks stunt brain  way to be uh whatever hey uh hillary is finally out of the uh the race why she was doing so well  i'm just thrilled to death is going to be a growing pains reunion show what oh please i couldn't be  happier why why do they do this holy jesus all right hillary dropping out uwe bowl oh uve bowl 
[02:05:30]  king taco from philly you get the credit on that one everyone needs credit every single person i don't  get the guy credit um hillary thanks her supporters it's over but she's suspending uh well no who knows  a lot about the this uh politics uh thing a stunt throat stunt uh brain what are the uh what are the  bullet points as far as the hillary thing goes jesus she uh did suspend the campaign but it took 
[02:06:00]  her 650 words into her thank you speech to mention obama and she threw her support behind it but it  seemed like her jaw was clenched pretty tightly during the whole thing she mentioned his name  like eight was it 18 times yeah but it was a almost a half hour speech and uh she said i'm with you a  hundred percent but it it never reached the level of emotion she had and she was actually pretty good  this is probably the best speech she gave in the campaign and everyone says a little too late 
[02:06:30]  she's a terrible speaker yep she's no charisma phony yes she has a fake smile that just turns on like  a light switch i disagree bob i think it's genuine and beautiful i love her big brown teeth  her overbite and her fat little knobby cheeks and like jim says a stick of butter sticks of butter  legs yeah that have been rounded off things of cookie dough like when you buy cookie dough  with little fat ham hock hey ham hock touchy tell your story walking we just uh all right here's here's 
[02:07:00]  women and men young and old latino and asian african-american and caucasian  how about just women and men that covers it poor and middle class gay and straight you have  stood with me is she kathy griffin she's really irritating me and i will continue to stand strong 
[02:07:30]  with you every time every place in every way that i can on those stonehenge legs  and then um she's trying to be powerful by mentioning people's black and white how about  women and men that covers everybody yeah sure yeah male female hillary throws her support behind  obama to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take notice how she just changed her delivery  it's very low-key yeah like you were saying and uh i heard she read this part everything else you're 
[02:08:00]  just looking at the uh crowd and her supporters and just you know speaking you know i think she's got  something up her sleeve i'm telling you she's gonna she knows there's something on obama that's  going to happen and she's going to pull it out she can't be the one that says it there's something  she could she's probably waiting for that first uh ad that comes out from the mccain camp and goes  all right i'm back in i i only suspended my campaign yeah now she needs something huge just suspended their  campaign like she's doing their stump brain or is this uh okay yeah the um new mitt romney did as well 
[02:08:30]  he suspended his campaign didn't throw it but it's common i guess to say just in case anything  happens okay well isn't it because she if she if she quits now then she owes all that money but if  she suspends it she can still collect money and uh pay back her debt exactly that too and she still  owes 30 some million dollars um nathan k from toronto thank you uh he writes anthony hadn't heard of the 
[02:09:00]  movie you know before the devil knows you're dead because that was the day he chose jill over  responsibility hey these guys are on you man hey all right here's more hillary to accomplish the goals  for which we stand is to take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect  barack obama the next president of the united states  he got into puppet voice sucks who is suggesting that mccain should take uh hillary clinton as vice 
[02:09:30]  president that would be insane yeah but because of could he do it no sure he could do it but it won't  happen but think about it if it he reached across the aisle and said it's me and hillary she'd jump  at it because he's only going to last one term if he gets in it would hurt him though he wouldn't  win with her hey i know is it is he is he sick because i mean i look at his hands are always 
[02:10:00]  shaking even when he holds the microphone his hands are shaking like he can't control his i was  bludgeoned for years in a pow camp smash your shoulders for the next three years and see if your  hands shake bob go ahead i don't like the guy but i do it i defend him as a war you don't  absolutely i do a war hero it's not prisoner of war my father was in nom let's jam freaking  bamboo spikes into your shoulders for the next uh year and see how you do go ahead do it now 
[02:10:30]  let's test this theory  ow ow ow all right all right i find it sad that he can't put a cell phone up to his ear myself he can't  not really man he has a tough time he has to use the old cell phones just so he can hold it by his  shoulder in his head i don't even think he can lift his shoulder up wow he has to be able to  comb his hair and stuff but it's probably just really awkward they just broke every bone in his  body yeah that's the guy you want pummeled his genitalia did they really oh yeah his genitals got  beat up he's where it'd be bad you know what are they gonna do oh let's beat him up but leave those 
[02:11:00]  alone how do they punish his genitalia so you just punch him punch him in it but do you know for sure  that's what they did oh yeah yeah they just they beat the crap out of every part of him and including  there i think i could deal with any type of torture except for the beheading once they do  that but the punching is just every military secret yes there will be a flight of b-52s they  will be arriving here at 1600 hours uh they'll be flying in from the west uh she is the altitude

Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death?  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you. 
[02:15:00]  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos.  And he fills his head with salsa.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are, XM Satellite Radio.  Robert Kelly in studio.  Opie and Anthony.  One guy on the bleachers.  Are you a fan?  I'm a big fan. 
[02:15:30]  Big fan on the bleachers.  One guy.  Big fan.  God, Friday or Thursday, last time we did a live show,  there had to be 50 to 60 people here easily.  Those people that were going to the animation festival.  The good old animation festival, which was a huge success.  Very, very happy.  I think that with a little tweaking, this thing could be a hit again.  What am I trying to say?  I don't know.  With a little tweaking, it could be even better next time.  Even better, I should say.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And I think we're looking toward Boston or Washington or Washington, D.C. 
[02:16:00]  for the next animation festival.  And we know we have a hit on our hands, so we're not going to wait a year.  We're going to do this in the fall.  Let's do it tomorrow.  Hopefully October.  Tomorrow.  Well, we've got to get Will and XM and the gang to get the prize money even higher.  Because that's the thing.  If we're going to continue with these animation festivals, it's got to get bigger and better  as we move on.  Yeah, because I think XM Sirius should actually chip in and help us just do a little bit better  next time.  Oh, really?  Merger going through.  Merger going through. 
[02:16:30]  Merger going through.  Oh, really?  When?  I don't know.  I actually talked to Kevin Martin.  Yeah.  And he's like...  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we're instant message friends.  And he's like, look, I got some merger news.  And I'm like, look, well, I'm on the phone.  Whatever.  Didn't he say to keep it under your hat, though?  He said, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  And you can go out and buy some stock, but just don't say anything.  Yeah, no problem.  That's fine.  Of course.  Why would you say that?  Keep it under your hat.  Yeah, he told me that.  Between you and me, James.  What's up, Robert Kelly?  You said, can I say something about...  Say it!  Is that a blackberry? 
[02:17:00]  I wanted to enter my animation in the festival.  What was it?  I drew a picture of a cock with a face over a birthday cake with no icing.  And then it says, happy birthday, dickhead.  And it shoots a load all over the cake.  Is it an animation, though?  And then it turns into icing.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Let's see it.  All right.  Do you really have this?  Yeah.  Can you send it to my blackberry?  Yes, I can.  I'm doing it because Jimmy hates that.  That's the worst fucking sound. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, I know.  I can't even deal with hearing that.  All right.  Well, how is John McCain swinging a golf club on TV?  He's using his robotic arm.  He's 1,400 under par.  What's going on with him?  Is he sweating?  Or is that like where someone branded him?  They have to put Vaseline on his face before he goes under the sun.  Yeah.  Why is he in the sun?  Did you see the picture in the paper of everything that's wrong with him?  And most of it's like skin cancer.  Why would you be in the sun ever again?  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Anyway.  Can you put a cap on that, Bob, so you don't spill it on my Malcolm McDowell pictures?  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  I'd cry.  Would you cry?  But it's in plastic.  It doesn't matter.  Plastic.  No, but there's open ends.  I got it.  Ends.  We have to bring up something about the animation festival.  Why the booing of Dan Natterman?  Why the booing of Russ Vaneeve forcing Mike DiStefano, who went last, to just attempt to beat up the audience?  I mean...  He did say something funny.  I'll tell you the truth.  It makes it harder and harder to do things for a New York audience. 
[02:18:30]  We're going to have to start taking our stuff outside of New York because...  Yeah.  A lot of...  I shouldn't even say a lot.  There's a small group of fans that are fucking it up for everybody.  And I could completely understand if Dan Natterman sucked.  I don't even know if he sucked.  He's very funny.  I'm sorry, but I don't even know if he sucked because no one gave him a fucking chance at the animation festival.  And I know he's a funny guy.  Jimmy, of course, knows he's a funny guy.  He's at the cellar with Jimmy almost every night.  Yep. 
[02:19:00]  And what pissed me off was that the fans didn't even give him a chance.  Not the fans, but a small group of fans.  And then they ruin it for everybody else.  And it's like...  That small group sure sounded big.  It started...  Yeah, then it got crazy.  It started growing, but...  It was started by just a few people.  It's like, come on, man.  And then they start booing because all of a sudden he's being a little thrown by it  because there's 1,800 people in the audience and he's hearing booze from a bunch of them.  And then when all of them start giving him shit, it's like, come on, man.  He really is a funny comedian. 
[02:19:30]  I mean...  It makes it tougher and tougher to do events for the New York fans because, you know,  they've seen it all with us.  They've been there from the beginning when we were just doing tiny little bar gigs.  And it's kind of frustrating because our thought was to throw a few new comedians at you guys  instead of, like, not the same old, you know, because these guys are all great,  but maybe a different look.  Three new guys that you could go, wow, this is three new comedians I've never seen before.  You guys actually put a lot of comics on the show and let them do their thing, which is great. 
[02:20:00]  A lot of shows don't do that.  And, Adam, those shows that you put together are hard gigs to do.  Even if it was just their regular show, like, where it wasn't a radio thing,  if you were to go in there and try to do that gig, it would be a tough gig anyways.  You know, that's not a comedy setting.  And Natterman isn't a rock and roll type of comedy guy who can go out there  and just slam him over the head right away and keep it going.  I mean, he's a subtle comic.  And funny, man.  Hilarious.  We wanted to give three different comics.  What do you think? 
[02:20:30]  We're going to put shitty acts on?  Maneve is hilarious.  He really is.  Fucking Natterman's hilarious.  DeStefano's hilarious.  Jimmy, before this goes by, I need some feedback, because I'm getting a lot today.  Rich in Manhattan.  Natterman was okay, but the second guy, Russ, was really funny.  There were these group of fucking drunk asses behind me  and friends who were booing and not even listening.  Russ started off with a rape joke, for God's sake.  He's just a funny dude.  Russ has a joke.  He goes, like, I was dating an Asian girl.  Something along the lines.  You know how you break up with an Asian girl?  You just keep telling her her feet are big until she kills herself. 
[02:21:00]  What?  That's not fucking...  That's a great...  That's the type of comic he is.  He's fucking...  Yeah.  He's a panic, if I may.  Who's booing him?  Where the hell did that come from?  Maybe...  I think Natterman was probably a little thrown by it, but he's more than okay.  Dan, we picked because he's really good.  I mean, he's a fucking twisted little fucking loon.  Isn't he on Last Comic Standing this time around, too?  I think he is, yeah.  He is.  He's going to do very, very well on Last Comic Standing. 
[02:21:30]  And we had a chance to show a lot of people Dan Natterman before he becomes big because  of the TV show.  Well, he's, you know...  And God bless him, because they're booing, and all of a sudden he started reading, what,  Walt Whitman or something?  Shakespeare.  He started doing poetry in Shakespeare.  Poetry and shit.  Where's my Shakespeare fans?  I just love the fact that he didn't back off.  No, but I don't know.  Yeah, but it's the thing.  When somebody boos, it's almost...  We do it at the cellar to Jimmy sometimes.  We do it to each other.  We'll be like, if he does a really racy joke, we'll be in the back going, ooh. 
[02:22:00]  Ooh.  And then you'll hear all the crowd will be like, ooh.  And then it's just...  Oh, it gets it going.  Yeah.  Fees itself.  Douche.  Me and Florentine got Voss.  We were at Caroline's, and of course the curtain was half closed.  It was a Sunday, though.  And me and Jim used to sit on one side of the curtain, and everything Voss did, because  it was really black, so you couldn't see, one of us was going, oh, come on.  Oh, man.  And then people are groaning, and fucking for 40 minutes, Voss's whole sentence, what the 
[02:22:30]  fuck?  Who keeps groaning?  And he was just scolding the audience.  Oh, that's great.  Jim is the best at it.  Jim will just stand there and go, oh, come on.  He'll actually sound like a disgruntled audience member, and then it just gets people going,  oh.  Oh, and my new favorite thing is to do it to DiPaolo at the cellar.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Because Nick is so fucking easily riled.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  He could be killing, and he goes, so I fucked a baby, and one person goes, ooh, what are  you, a bunch of NYU liberals? 
[02:23:00]  He just wipes their heads off.  NYU liberals, yeah.  Fucking soccer moms.  That's great.  Getting back to some eyewitness reports, Brian from Long Beach, it wasn't that they were  bad, it's just that you had a bunch of drunk assholes who wanted to feel special and  be part of the show.  Yeah.  Dan and Russ are funny fuckers.  Your fans are savages.  To the booing, Jimmy.  From Dan N. from New York.  That was Fast Freddy.  Rich from Manhattan again.  Due to the booing, Jimmy, I couldn't really hear Dan Natterman, so I couldn't give him 
[02:23:30]  a fair shake.  This guy wants to congratulate Anthony on his engagement.  Um, Jesus.  All right.  Yeah, check Natterman out.  I don't even know if he has a website.  He's a mess, but he's just, he's a really funny comic, man.  When our fans boo and do all that stuff, I actually really do enjoy that, but what I  don't, I guess my problem is that I just felt like he wasn't even given a chance.  Someone else said he flubbed his first joke or something like that.  Oh, did he?  And that was it.  They gave him one shot, and that was it. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, but if you think about it, though, you put together a great show.  You put different comics out there.  You just shut your face.  We wouldn't just.  Especially if you.  We really, we really picked, well, we wanted Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, he was a nice bro.  We wanted Nick DiPaolo.  He was booked.  But it wasn't like we threw three guys at you.  We're like, ah, these guys will do.  We really thought that we picked three guys that, you know, the fans would have enjoyed.  Well.  But that wasn't the case.  Well, Opie, thank you for putting me out there. 
[02:24:30]  I had a hell of a time.  And someone else was saying he was a douche, and he sucked.  No, he doesn't do.  And again, I'm going to say, it's the best taste in pickle I've ever had.  Yeah, exactly.  If he was a bad comic, we wouldn't have put him on the show.  You know, there's a lot of.  We just don't want to put traveling virus guys on.  Yeah.  When everybody, they see different comedians.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mark in Canada.  Mark, we got the audio from the festival.  We got to do something in Canada, by the way.  Mark, what's up?  Yeah, hi, guys.  Love you guys.  Love the show. 
[02:25:00]  I've burned it a little.  Jimmy?  How are you?  Calling from Canada.  Sorry?  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah.  Anyways, I just wanted to comment on the show there.  And I was sitting in the right-hand section.  Wait, hold on.  You're calling from Canada, and you came down for the festival?  Yeah.  Fucking A, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, I made it down.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  I missed your show on Thursday because I slept through, got drunk.  Yeah.  Anyways, yeah, I was sitting on the right-hand side of the, well, I guess that's the seating  place, whatever.  And we couldn't hear anything. 
[02:25:30]  Couldn't hear anything.  It was just mumbling and all that.  And I tried to move in the back of the center of the speakers and all that in the back, but  you couldn't stay there because the security would kick you out because you had to keep  the aisle free.  So once the first guy was gone, the second guy, you could barely hear as well.  Everybody just basically left and just started booing and getting some drinks.  All right.  Well, that sucks.  Yep.  Yeah, it does.  Anyways, I just want to say the after party was awesome.  I'd like to thank Anthony there and Jill for meeting them and all that and all the fans 
[02:26:00]  that were there.  They were really nice.  Can't wait to make it to the next show.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, Mark.  What after party?  Yeah.  At Olunis.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody.  HDG was nice.  Steve from Bayshore, bottom of B there, like you guys said, and everybody else there.  It was really awesome, guys.  Where's Travis?  I'm not saying what Travis wrote.  Oh, really?  Travis, hold on a second, Mark.  Travis.  You're right.  You're right, kiddo. 
[02:26:30]  What's that?  What's my...  You know what's funny about Travis?  He has to get situated and put his headphones on before he talks.  I know.  And that's what you hear is the silence of Travis.  He's getting ready to broadcast.  Yeah, he's like Ed Norton playing the piano.  Just grab a fucking mic and talk.  I'm sorry.  He adjusts his volume.  He puts his headphones on.  I'm sorry.  He does.  He did nice on his head.  All settled in, are you?  I noticed that a long time ago, but today it bothers me.  Thanks, though.  For his two seconds of gold, there he goes. 
[02:27:00]  Just grab a fucking mic, say it, and get back to the phone.  Maybe not.  What do you got?  This guy just would not shut up.  Really?  He talked to everyone.  We went to Oluni's.  But he's not from Bayshore.  He's from Canada.  So it's not like he's going to be at the next one.  This is probably a once in a while.  He was so excited to meet all the interns, even the new ones.  I can hit traffic here.  Punch it out.  All right.  All right.  Punch it out.  Punch it out.  So what happened, Travis?  No, he just wouldn't shut up.  He was talking to everyone. 
[02:27:30]  Are you sure you're situated?  Yes, I'm good.  I'm ready to go.  You want coffee for that?  Fucking goofing on a Canadian?  Yeah.  Ah, man.  I hate volume.  Man, they clear my...  Hold on a minute.  Ah, ah, ah.  Testing one, two.  Testing.  I think all these levels aren't right.  I'm a little bassy.  Here we go.  Oh, can I get some water?  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  Me, me, me, me.  Water for the guest, please.  He talked a lot. 
[02:28:00]  Doing vocal gymnastics before he goes on mic.  All right.  I'm going to go answer phones now.  Take care.  You do that.  What do you do before you pick up each phone?  Do you fucking wipe the phone down and fucking unplug and plug the connection and make sure  it's in?  Check your phone service.  Boo, Jim, boo.  Best butcher.  Boo.  I can't put water.  I got my water now.  All right.  We got Dan Aderman getting booed, but then he goes into poetry.  Listen to this.  To be or not to be. 
[02:28:30]  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  How do you not?  God bless Dan Aderman.  Now, you know, because the mic is more like a unidirectional, so you don't really get to  hear the crowd as loud as it really was.  But trust me, they're booing really, really loud.  To be or not to be.  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or  to take arms against the sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them. 
[02:29:00]  Ah, to die.  To sleep.  Ah, there's the rub.  You're in that sleep of death.  That's what dreams may come.  Oh, thank you, Will.  Hey, how you doing?  How much time do I have, Ed?  Holy s***.  Ed.  Not much.  Wow.  This is wonderful.  I really feel the love.  I'm so grateful for you.  I really am having a great time.  You know.  I think it's going well for them. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, no, it's going great.  Keep going.  I was at the bookstore the other day.  I don't know if you've been to the Barnes and Nobles recently.  I go to the one on 86th and 2nd Avenue.  Well, anyway, have you seen all these idiots?  Wow, the audience seems talkative.  Well, they're a little high-spirited, that's true.  Hey.  Yes.  They seem a little talkative during your set.  Well, they're high-spirited.  That's how they show their enthusiasm and their love for me.  Yeah.  And I so do appreciate it. 
[02:30:00]  You know, this is applause in Afghanistan.  That's how they applaud.  And I appreciate it, but if you would just mind settling down just a wee bit, I'll continue with my set.  I have some more poetry coming up.  And also, if you will know, I want to talk about some...  Yes.  What the hell are you thinking is, Bill Burr?  I was at the bookstore the other day on 86th and 2nd Avenue.  Well, anyway, I saw one book, Calculus for Dummies. 
[02:30:30]  I saw a book called Calculus for Dummies.  Now, how are you going to teach a dummy calculus?  That's what I wanted to know.  Calculus for Dummies should just be...  Open it up and says, all right, you're going to have to cheat.  By the way, we...  Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, my call came and took him off.  Yeah.  Dan Natterman, everyone!  Dan Natterman!  Wow! 
[02:31:00]  You b******s are tough tonight.  Holy b******s.  This...  You're vicious.  There you go.  Dan Natterman.  Dan Natterman.com, yes, is his website.  And he's going to be...  There is...  Oh, wow.  Is this video anywhere?  I see the TMZ kid just lifting up Dan Natterman and taking him off the stage.  That's YouTube.  If you just type in...  Yeah, Dan Natterman animation, this will pop right up.  Very, very cool.  Well, there you have it.  But, you know, he wasn't flustered, that's what you are.  And how do you memorize that crap? 
[02:31:30]  That poetry crap.  That's what I love so much about comedians sometimes, though, is just the belligerence.  Like, that's everyone's greatest fear in life, is to have that happen to them.  And the belligerence of a comic to just motherfuck them back, but by doing poetry, it was great.  And it wasn't like he's a shitty comic.  If he's a shitty comic, just trying to overcompensate by being belligerent, that's one thing.  But he really is a good act.  Yeah.  And Dan Natterman's a lawyer.  I mean, he's a real intelligent guy.  That's helping sell him. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, I'm just...  You're screaming at me, Bob.  You're a lawyer?  I'm not trying to sell him.  I'm just saying that he's a very intelligent guy.  He doesn't have to tell jokes for a living, you know what I mean?  He's a very funny guy.  He was actually on Cringe Humor's hack list at one point.  Yeah, I talked to him about that.  He's like, wait, you can't make them take it off.  But I was like, a hack...  It's not a hack.  To define somebody as unfunny is one thing, but to define somebody as a hack, you have to  know what a hack is.  And Dan Natterman is not a hack at all.  If you think he stinks, that's your option.  Who's a comedy hack? 
[02:32:30]  Bob to Swallow?  Or a comedian hack?  What?  Fuck, there's so many of them on the road, man.  I mean, a lot of them you just find are fucking nameless, faceless guys.  They're guys that are doing shit like fucking just generic, evening at the improv type stuff.  Fuck.  You don't want to say?  I'm trying to think of one.  I'm honestly trying to think of one.  Yeah, I'm thinking you guys don't want to say.  People think a joke thief is a hack.  A joke thief is a joke thief.  A hack is a guy who's doing like OJ jokes, you know, now, you know, and cruise ship guys 
[02:33:00]  are like hacks.  Most of them are, yeah.  What defines a hack?  A guy that does the same act over and over again?  Yeah, it's just, it's tried and true, a million, with no new angle.  Like, it's sometimes, it's almost like pornography.  I can't define it, but I know it when I see it.  Like, it's not even certain subject matter, because, you know, comedians should be able  to talk about anything, but when you hear a guy doing a joke about McNuggets, where 
[02:33:30]  part of the chicken does that come from, or just the same shit that you're like, oh  yeah, I've heard that, oh yeah, but you know that they're not themed.  So, Kevin Meany, hack.  Yeah, but again, Kevin was doing stuff, though.  See, it's hard to say Meany's a hack, because he's been doing stuff like before it was hacky.  Like, when you've created, like, prior shit, a lot of it today, the black and white angle  would be hacky, because it's been redone from when his brilliance brought it out so many  times.  Right, right.  You know, but now it's become a lot of phony black rage and contrived shit that they just 
[02:34:00]  got from watching him.  Like, they're reacting to his brilliance as opposed to real life.  This is just like, this is just like that animation.  Look at Bobby's eating a sandwich, just...  Dude!  Dude!  That was so funny.  All I see is a rock now when I look at you, Bobby.  That one where you're eating the sandwich, and it's just, you get mayo on the console,  and each shot the sandwich is smaller and smaller.  That was a great one.  All right.  Who's Daniel C? 
[02:34:30]  This was...  We sent some of our interns out during the animation festival to just get audio from just  random fans that were in line.  Okay.  And just walking around.  All right.  And I heard a piece of this.  I didn't hear the whole thing, but the part that I did hear from this, this guy just sounds  very creepy, and I was getting a little douche chills listening to this guy.  Daniel C is creepy?  Yeah, absolutely.  And he's one of our interns?  No, no, no, no.  He's one of the fans that were at the animation festival.  One of our interns was interviewing him.  Oh, okay.  I think this was...  Oh, Daniel C interviewed at the animation festival. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think Creepy Jones was interviewing him.  Okay, so he's a fan.  All right.  All right.  What's your name and where you're from?  My name's Daniel Curlin from Queens, New York.  I am hearing from some of the super producers that they're looking for a listener as the  last judge.  Why should it be you?  It should be me because I discovered them on it.  I actually heard about them from a trip to Massachusetts way back when, and as soon as 
[02:35:30]  I heard, they were in New York, I listened, and I listened every morning.  Oh, my God.  And he fell down the stairs and his shoes fell off.  Wow.  Yes.  Now he has Civil War memorabilia.  That guy sucks.  I like this guy.  All right.  How much would you pay for a ticket to smell Ant's Fingers?  To smell Ant's Fingers?  What is the question? 
[02:36:00]  Creep Pie Jones?  How much?  Did he write that?  I don't know.  Unfortunately, he's not here today, so we can't.  Unfortunately.  Listen to this question again.  Huh?  Who wrote this question?  That's Ant's Girlfriend you're talking about.  Of course.  Seriously.  How much would you pay for a ticket to smell Ant's Fingers?  To smell Ant's Fingers?  I would pay 50 for that.  50.  Why?  I want to fondle Jim's bottom first.  Because it would just be one of the freaking funniest memories I've seen in my life. 
[02:36:30]  What?  Have you ever smelled another man's fingers?  I think I have many times.  My cousin, Andrea, used to be one heck of a prankster.  Kept me up all night one time with that.  Doing what?  I don't know what she put in her fingers that smelled horrible.  Something that smelled like fish?  Yeah, exactly.  That's what I think it was.  She must have took some fish or something that my mother had bought. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Or maybe she was diddling herself.  I have no idea what the heck it is.  I just know she did a bunch of crazy stuff back then.  Oh my god.  She would finger herself and make him smell it.  How fucking great is that?  When she's all filthy, dirty twat.  How great is that?  This is...  What was the name of that movie?  Bad Boy Bubby?  Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Bad Boy Bubby.  You ever see Bad Boy Bubby? 
[02:37:30]  Do we have that one clip?  The end sucks.  The beginning's great.  Yeah, the movie just completely falls apart, but Bad Boy Bubby is...  Can we get the first clip?  Bob Kelly, you've never seen Bad Boy Bubby?  Never.  Oh man, you're in for a treat.  I don't know why there's tickets though.  That means there's more than one smelling of Anthony's finger.  Yeah, would you sell to buy a ticket?  A lot of people saying, ugh, this guy's a creep.  I like this Daniel C. guy.  Other than Patrice O'Neill, how many black people do you know? 
[02:38:00]  Simple.  Almost everybody in the high school I went to, I went to Hillcrest High School in Jamaica  Queen.  It was a...  I swear, the place was probably a black neighborhood.  They had security guards there.  That's how bad it was.  They made me take off my shoes when I had braces.  I had to take my shoes off.  That's how bad the...  That's how much black people was in my school.  And he's not putting the voice on.  Doesn't make sense though.  Huh?  Doesn't make sense.  Because that's how much black people were in my school. 
[02:38:30]  My shoes.  My shoes.  And finally, from Daniel C.  You got a big mule?  It's erected, yeah.  So you're a grower, not a shower?  Yeah, exactly.  I fat 48 operations on that thing.  Damn fracking doctor messed up an operation.  48 operations on your penis?  I was just fricking a year old.  They messed up an operation.  They messed up an operation that was supposed to be in my urinary system. 
[02:39:00]  Ideally died twice.  Wow.  So is it like all scarred up down there?  No, I just know...  I just know it's looked like it's been operated on.  All I know is that for that reason, I heard it.  I wasn't circumcised for that reason.  I'm sure he listens every day.  We got to get Daniel C. in the studio.  What's wrong with that, Franken-pecker?  I don't know.  We got to find out more about Daniel C.  Come on by and say hi to us soon. 
[02:39:30]  If you're out there in Radio Land.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  The opening of the tuna fish.  Can he open my tuna?  I saw that.  But he didn't drain the water, so every tuna bite is a mouthful of water!  Thank God it's not oil, though.  I don't like url.  The url and the tuna.  A mouthful of url.  You know what I like to drink?  I like to drain the url from a tuna can and just drink it plain.  Nice warm tuna url.  It's delish.  Do you have a blackberry? 
[02:40:00]  I can't take that.  I like babysitting.  Uncle Paul was a huge hit at the animation festival.  Of course he was.  Uncle Paul rules.  Uncle Paul was up in the balcony there and doing some Uncle Paul.  Nice reaction for Uncle Paul.  All the kids love him.  Sure.  Here's Cream Pie Jones.  YouTube, Opie and Anthony animations to check out the animations.  Cream Pie.  Hey, what's up?  Hey. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, Cream Pie.  Hey, what's up?  Did you write those questions?  Uh, I helped Tony with them.  Tony wrote most of the questions.  Uh-huh.  Is he on a spaceship right now?  I'm so glad, uh, almost four years later we got the phones fixed.  So, uh, who wrote the, uh, one about, um, paying money to smell my fingers?  Um, uh, that was a combined question. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, what part was yours?  Yeah.  Um.  That was a combined.  The, uh, how much money would you pay?  Who mentioned the fingers?  That's a liar.  Spineless ass.  Yeah.  Who mentioned smelling the fingers?  Um, Tony.  He's lying.  You had nothing to do with it.  No, I didn't.  You know, we'll talk to Tony.  Yeah.  Okay.  Because that's like, that's Ant's chick now.  It's not just some broad he hooked up with. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  So when you say to a guy, and this is true, when you say to any guy, smell my fingers,  you're basically saying, do you want to smell this chick's pussy?  And that's fine if we're banging a girl.  Right.  But it's not just dating a chick.  You're basically saying, hey, don't you want to smell Ant's chick's pussy?  And it's like, you know, come on.  Well, you said it to me a couple times and they've been in your ass and your belly button,  so.  That's a goof, yeah, but I never said that about, like, your woman, right?  I mean, I've never.  Yeah, that's disrespectful there, Bobby.  Even much as me and Bobby shit on each other. 
[02:42:00]  There's a difference right there.  Yeah, that's crossing the line.  I just wouldn't.  Hey, I'm hearing Daniel C. showed everyone a picture of a dog carcass.  Is that true?  Yeah.  Well, a dog's a tumor.  You saw this too?  Yeah, he probably came up.  He goes, this is a tumor.  So you met Daniel C.?  Yeah, well, me and Patrice met him.  What's up, B-Rock?  We just stood there in shock.  Yeah, he was stopping cops that were on the sidewalk, security people, anybody to do with  the show.  He would just kind of corner you and shove the camera right in your face.  Who?  So this guy, it was a dog tumor that looked like it was in a baking pan sitting in an 
[02:42:30]  oven.  Yeah.  He's got a picture of it?  It was right on his camera.  And he was telling you the whole history of where it came from and how he got it.  Let's get this guy on the show.  All right.  Thank you, Cream Pie.  Oh, hold on.  Tony's on the line.  Tony, you're on with Cream Pie Jones.  Anthony has a question for you.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Tony.  How you doing?  You know the question and answer thing that Cream Pie Jones did? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Who wrote those questions?  I wrote those questions the day of the event.  I kind of think it might have been, I might have heard it from somewhere else, but I was  the one who wrote it.  Well, I don't understand.  What is actually, could you go through what that one means?  Like, analyze what that one means? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, no.  It was just a thing like, you know, goofing around because, uh...  No, no, no.  Oh, definitely, bro.  I'm not saying it was out of bad intent, but what does it mean?  Like, two Jews walking into a bar.  They own it.  The joke is that you think people are walking into a bar just to get a drink, but turns out  the Jews, who are notoriously wrapped up in money, own the bar.  See, that's the analysis of that joke.  So what exactly is the analysis of the question?  Um, it was just, uh, to see.  I just woke up, so I didn't hear you guys smashing. 
[02:44:00]  I'm assuming you smashed it now, but, um, I don't know.  I don't have to, it was just to have fun.  It would be fun.  You don't know what it means?  Yeah.  Why would anyone pay to, like, smell my fingers?  Why wouldn't they pay to smell Danny's or Jim's or anybody else around the room?  Well, you know, maybe just because, uh, you, you eat a lot of cantaloupe every day and  it's tasty and fun and it smells good. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, that must have been it.  I'm not sure.  I'm sorry if anybody got offended.  I was just trying to have fun with everything, you know.  I'm just curious as to what it meant.  I'm just wondering.  Yeah, no, I'm sorry if anybody decided, you know.  I just woke up too, so I'm sorry if I'm a little, I'm really, uh, into sleeping.  No reason to, uh, you know, be sorry.  It must be great to be able to sleep in. 
[02:45:00]  How does that feel?  Damn.  It's been amazing.  I've been up for five fucking hours already.  Yeah, it was, like, John and Kate plus eight till, like, four in the morning.  Like, when that question was formed, I'm just curious.  Yeah.  Like, did you see Jill and go, oh my God.  Yeah, we're kind of beating around the bush here, Tom.  Yeah, yeah.  What is, yeah.  Let's cut to the chase.  Not about people being offended or any of that stuff.  Um, well, yeah.  I mean, she is, uh, she's amazing.  I mean, you know, every, any, anybody would be lucky to even, uh, be associated with a 
[02:45:30]  woman like that.  I mean, let's be honest.  Whether through going out, uh, relationship, uh, or just smelling some guy's fingers.  Is what you're saying.  I mean, the people that were in that line, let's be honest, they're not gonna, they're  gonna have no idea ever.  So the only way they would be was maybe get a, uh, a whiff of something, you know.  They were just animals like me.  I fit right in.  Uh, everybody was cool, but I mean, they're not gonna, they're not gonna have anything 
[02:46:00]  like that ever.  Mm-hmm.  But everybody was cool.  It was a great show.  We had a good time.  All right.  Uh, Steve, uh, B from New York City.  I sat next to a dog tumor guy at the show, second row, center left.  He smelled terrible, terrible in capital letters.  He kept taking pictures during the show.  Listen to this, Jimmy.  And when he raised his arms and take a picture, the worst odor I ever smelled.  That's the kind of piece.  Wafed it right into me.  Thanks a lot.  What? 
[02:46:30]  That's the kid on the bleachers.  He just feedbacked it.  He's sitting right out there.  Wait.  Yeah.  Right there from the fucking bleachers.  That's not him.  Uh.  That's not him.  If we could prove.  That's what, that's what you just said, though.  That's not him.  If we could prove that, you're going home.  That's not him.  Back in, did you?  No, I didn't feedback, but I did sat behind him.  So you sat behind him, but.  I did sat behind him?  Oh, yeah.  So you know what this guy's talking about?  Yeah, he's just a, he was a freak.  I saw a couple friends from high school.  I was like, oh, yo, what's up, man?  ONA all the way.  He turns around and goes, yeah. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, hey, do you remember that bit with Anthony?  With the butt plug?  The butt plug.  The butt plug.  The butt plug.  This guy go.  And he kept turning around the whole night, and he just said, more chill.  More jazz.  I love these guys.  You make me less mad in the morning.  Can you do that again?  Sure.  Love to.  You sound like, what's his name?  Family guy.  He's cranking.  What the?  Huh?  Mort.  Mort, right?  Is it Mort?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're right.  Okay.  Pretty good. 
[02:47:30]  Very good.  Are you a comedian or something?  No, I'm not.  I'm trying to be an actor, like little Jimmy.  Oh, very good.  Oh.  All right.  Thank you, Tony.  Is Anthony satisfied with Tony's explanation, Anthony?  With any questions you had?  No, I think he was still just kind of beating around the bush thing.  Wasn't really hitting it, you know, on the head.  You didn't explain yourself very much, but...  He'd explain the joke, I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  Didn't really get to it.  You know, I guess we'll have to do that at some later juncture. 
[02:48:00]  Let's say hi to Jeff in New York.  Jeff?  Hey, guys.  Just bear with me for one moment.  It sounds like Anthony was a little upset about that question that was asked.  You know, which I would be, too, if someone said that about my girlfriend or insinuated that.  But what I need to tell you, not Anthony, Opie and Jimmy and the staff is, you've got to start taking easy on Anthony and bringing stuff up about his girl. 
[02:48:30]  Because if it's getting to this point where if he's going to get upset, you know, with our fans or your fans, all of us, you know, we're kind of jerks about how we bring stuff up.  Well...  We don't know when to stop it sometimes.  Well, I'm the one who just pointed out...  We...  I'm the one who just pointed out, like, that's Ant's chick you're talking about.  That's not some random girl.  Yeah, it went from this thing to it's a real relationship now.  We don't even dare look up when we're prepping for the show when she does traffic anymore. 
[02:49:00]  The old days, we're all looking and commenting.  Now it's like, Anthony's the only one looking up out of respect.  We're all like...  We're talking about Anthony, him and his girl.  We're not talking about her.  We're not doing...  We're just talking about his love.  Yeah.  And we're just goofing on how much he likes her.  We're not smashing him.  Yeah.  You know, smashing her.  He's talking about smelling my fingers.  Yeah, that's awful.  We're not doing that.  I mean, his girl is a really beautiful girl.  We respect her a lot.  It's just, you know, Anthony, you know, being in love so quick, so fast.  And we knew that...  Fag. 
[02:49:30]  This whole thing would...  I'm kidding.  We knew this whole thing would turn.  It's turning now.  It's becoming a real thing.  And to answer your question, a lot of money.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, I was sitting across the way from that dog tumor guy, and he came over and talked  to me and tried to show me that picture, too.  He was also holding up a wow sign, one of the bumper stickers, just trying to get girls  to flash him, but he was just acting like a whack-out.  Can you imitate the guy?  Can you imitate the guy?  I can.  No, the guy out there. 
[02:50:00]  Bleacher guy.  Here he goes.  Yeah.  Bring the microphone in.  W-N-E-W, man.  You did the best.  Opie and Anthony rule.  Yeah.  Stop.  Bring the microphone in so we can see your face.  Just get it behind the wall.  Here you go.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony, man.  Do you see the bit with Roland when they tickled him?  Man, it was so funny.  He went crazy on Poe, man.  That was weird. 
[02:50:30]  You got to get the real guy in now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Are you done with Tony and cream pie?  They're it.  Yeah, I think so.  For now.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  I think he's too tired to release the wrath of Tony.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  We got to.  I'll go and take a leak.  Yeah.  Splash a little water on my face.  I'll be fine.  I got something you can splash on if you want.  Oh, nice.  I've been keeping this really good face splashing liquid.  I fucking up in my Vaz Devans. 
[02:51:00]  I'd be happy to give you a fucking nice.  It's probably a nice tapioca load I have.  I'd rather just lay my head in the urinal.  Hold on.  Do you want that?  I'm just asking the cum eater if he wants it.  Yeah, cum eater.  Carl, let me tell you something.  I'm going to fucking smash my fist in your neck.  I hate when you say cum eater.  Why?  There's something about it.  I don't mean it.  Fat, fine.  I don't care.  Yeah, obvious.  Cum eater is stupid.  What's wrong with cum eater?  I don't like it.  Close to home.  Nah.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Yeah, you don't like it.  I can't believe he gets mad when I call him. 
[02:51:30]  I don't mind you saying cum sucker, licker, swallower.  That's not accurate, though.  Cum eater.  You know what it makes gross?  Eating it.  Yeah, it's like...  You want to eat some cum?  Yeah, it's like cold chowder.  Just chow...  I don't know.  You don't eat it cold.  That's only if a guy keeps it in his hand until it gets cold and says,  go ahead, lick puppy.  Lick puppy.  And then you eat the cum out of his hand cold.  But if the guy just kind of holds your head hanging over the edge of the bed,  and he shoots it in your mouth,  let's say he just jerks it off home in your face. 
[02:52:00]  He's holding your cheeks, and your mouth is open.  He comes in your mouth.  And he goes, go ahead, cum eater.  Take it, cum eater.  And then you eat it.  What fucking videos do you watch to get the dialogue so perfect?  This is my head short.  It amazes me.  It does seem like you get the dialogue down.  It's not like you can just make that up.  It's not like you're just searching and fishing for words.  No, there's no way.  It's perfect.  You memorized it.  No, I'm saying.  You memorize this stuff like Dan Natterman memorizes poetry.  Yeah.  But I'm saying it's different. 
[02:52:30]  Like to eat cold cum out of someone's hand would be so weird.  Weird.  Well, you imagine someone who came in their own hand while you melt like a puppy watching,  and they put their hand under your nose and made you smell it,  and it got cold.  And they said, come on, eat, eat, puppy.  Come on, puppy, eat.  And you were like.  You suck it in like an 80-year-old guy with gelatin.  Yeah, and they turned his hand upside down and made you lick the back in case any leaked onto his knuckles.  Now you're feeling it.  Fucking specific.  Harry man knuckles.  Oh, God, Jim.  Well, I'm asking you.  Eat a little cum.  It's okay.  We got a break with this and some feedback. 
[02:53:00]  Bill from Jersey.  Sure.  I have three of the gold medal PBA cards that they were talking about on Thursday's show  already engraved with Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy's name.  Really?  Hopefully they're using my real name because I can't hand it in an Opie card.  Oh.  All ready to go.  How do I get them to you guys?  Have Club Soda call or email me.  Sergeant Bill 73.  Well, don't do that.  Can you give this number to Clubby?  All right.  Quick break.  We'll return.  Opie, Anthony, and Norton, too. 
[02:53:30]  Good shots, great hits.  XF-202.  Suck my fucking cock.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony's shoe.  There was something we wanted to do, but now I'm not sure.  Yeah, I know we want to do this.  Oh, yeah, we want to do that. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, we definitely want to do this.  Oh, and what?  Why is that?  Is that asshole still on the phone?  Oh, this guy.  Let's say hi to Brad in Houston, Texas.  Brad, what's up?  Maybe I shouldn't call you an asshole.  Planet Houston.  Anthony, if you're seriously offended by that question from Cream Pod Jones, man, I kind  of got to call you a pussy, dude, because, I mean, it's a joke, man.  You can't take that seriously.  It's meant to elicit a funny response.  We know that.  Dude, first of all, I'm the one who brought it up, not Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  It's Norton.  I mentioned it.  Is that Jim?  Yes.  Sorry, my blackberry sucks ass, but Jimmy, man, I mean, you're one of the biggest  ones that's all about, you know, a joke is a joke.  Of course.  You can also take offense from jokes, because it's not intended really to be necessarily  offensive, but to make somebody laugh.  Did I know that?  Yeah.  Brad?  Brad?  Brad?  Yeah.  Can I bring something up and maybe pull away the curtain a little bit?  Oh, no.  Which wall are you tearing down today?  I hate to really tear this one down here, Brad.  Which wall, though?  Which wall? 
[02:55:00]  Wall number seven.  Oh, not wall number seven.  I hope the roof still stays on.  Oh, boy.  Back up.  But let me just...  Back up.  Wall number seven.  Come on.  Brad, let me explain something to you.  Okay.  Now, I hope you're listening closely.  I am.  If that kind of stuff really annoyed me, and I took it really seriously...  You'd shoot them?  I would shoot everyone in the room.  No, I think the guys...  See, we kind of talk off air sometimes about these things, and I really kind of think the 
[02:55:30]  guys would know not to really go there.  So when I was getting on them about it, it's kind of fun to goof on the interns and stuff  when they go out and do things and kind of get them upset and make them think that I'm  upset because it gets them, like, really nervous.  See, that's kind of what I was going for there.  I really don't care.  If someone wants to sniff my fingers, I'll be out in front of the building at 11 o'clock. 
[02:56:00]  You could smell away.  For real?  If I could be there from Houston that soon, I would be there because I would really like  to.  But I've washed my hands.  I've since handled my own cock as I've taken a piss.  I may take a dump and wipe my ass.  Hopefully, I'll slip off the paper and get a nice little shit smell that won't end for  a week.  That means both of your hands...  Some reason it doesn't fucking...  You can't wash that off.  Both of your hands smell like cock.  You just might want to smell your fingers more now, though.  I mean...  During the last break, Ant and I went for a leak, and after our leaks were done, Ant goes 
[02:56:30]  toward the faucets, and I went toward the door.  I go, ah, just leave the pee on my hands.  Yeah, and I think you...  I think you were.  You had your hands out like you'd been...  You'd been noodling.  You fucking...  They're wet and just...  All right, well, I'm glad you're not truly offended then, Anthony.  I did not lose any respect for that.  All right, well, thank you, Brad, that I had to ruin it, though, now.  I had to ruin the bit just to explain it to Brad.  All right, Brad.  I'm sorry to kill the show, guys. 
[02:57:00]  I just want my money back.  Brad.  Exactly.  Not the best call we ever took.  Brad.  Brad.  The way he looks at his name tag goes, Brad.  I'm with you.  I'm right there, buddy.  I love that one.  A little fast times for everybody.  We got a guy going on a stabbing spree in Tokyo, and then we're going to get into some C-Span prank calls that are really, really fun.  Ooh.  But first this.  Chaos on the streets of Tokyo, after a Japanese man goes from a midday... 
[02:57:30]  Chaos on the streets of Tokyo.  What was that?  Where is he from?  Where do we get our news clips from?  Because I noticed that we hear the same guy all the time.  This guy...  No, no, no.  This guy...  Is it an NPR?  No, no.  This guy works for the AP.  Oh, the AP.  I saw a lot of the AP stories end up being voiced by this guy.  I think they're trying to find a voice that could be picked up all over the world.  Almost neutral.  Yeah.  Like, it could be...  It could be an English accent.  It could be German. 
[02:58:00]  It could be a little German.  French.  Breakfast at Tiffany's.  No.  No.  No.  Douchebag.  Talk regular, asshole.  Chaos on the streets of Tokyo, after a Japanese man goes...  What do you like...  Chaos on the streets of Tokyo.  What do you like hearing better?  That or Blackberry?  Oh, please, Tokyo.  I love Tokyo, guys.  Chaos on the streets of Tokyo, after a Japanese man goes on a midday stabbing rampage, killing 
[02:58:30]  at least seven people and wounding another ten.  Officials say the deadly lunchtime attack began after a 25...  Is he on one of those kid roller coasters as he does this story?  Oh.  Yeah.  Not the big one.  You see, it's six flags, but just one of those wee, wee, wee, wee, up and down.  That is some whoop-dee-doos.  Whoop-dee-doos.  That's what is going on with his voice.  Five-year-old suspect plowed his rented truck into a crowded street full of Sunday shoppers. 
[02:59:00]  The suspect then allegedly jumped out of a vehicle and began slashing and stabbing at random.  Nice.  The six dead and 25 males...  And at least two of the injured remain in critical condition.  It happened in Tokyo's premier electronics and video game district, an area widely popular to the country's youth.  Police say they have arrested the man who allegedly told authorities he showed up Sunday to kill people.  Oh.  Japan has seen a spike in violent crimes in the last few years, and once-rare stabbing attacks have become more frequent. 
[02:59:30]  Anyone else notice that the guy's running out of energy as the story goes on?  Speaking of energy, five-hour energy.  Thanks, five-hour energy, for the free product.  They're hooking the show up with some energy drinks for the pest and crew.  They only had to give away one sample today to that guy.  Hey, could you do that guy's voice again?  Tumor?  Oh, yeah.  Dog tumor guy?  Yeah, move the microphone. 
[03:00:00]  Talk as dog tumor guy, talking about how great five-hour energy is.  It's delicious.  I had one.  I wouldn't be able to do this impression without it.  It's so great.  Hey, did you see the video about the butt plug?  Coke logic.  It was so good.  It was awesome.  Five-hour energy.  It's everywhere.  You've got to check it out for yourself.  And if you come by and check out the XM show, you get it for free.  Thank you, five-hour energy.  Is it good? 
[03:00:30]  It's terrific, yes.  Gives the energy.  Without the crash there, you know?  Yeah, it works or we wouldn't be talking about it, you cock.  What the fuck is your problem?  You fucking...  It's one of our advertisers.  Of course it works.  Why would you call me a cum eater, you cunt?  Yeah.  Cum eater.  Well, dude, fucking...  Shut your face.  Dude.  Shut up.  I'm only asking your question.  I'm going to fucking pour my water on you, McDowell.  Why?  Oh, no.  Too far.  Because if a man...  It's just too far.  If a man eats cum and you point it out, you say, why would you call me a cum eater? 
[03:01:00]  Well, the real question is, why do you chew it before swallowing it?  I don't know.  Because it's cold.  He said he likes it cold.  Because Bob likes cold cum eating out of a dominant man's cum.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  Do you understand the fucking detail that this little faggot...  I heard...  I just heard.  He said...  What did you call it?  A what?  A what man's cum?  I said out of a...  You like to eat cold cum.  Yeah.  Out of a hairy...  Or I don't know.  I don't even know what I said.  Oh, you said it in such a way... 
[03:01:30]  He says it in such a way...  It's very eloquent.  What was it?  He's actually just reading an old journal he had.  Yeah.  An old journal.  He had his hairy man...  And he jotted this down in.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Last night...  Dear diary.  Dear diary.  Last night, I ate cold cum out of a man's hairy knuckled hand.  It was my math teacher, Mr. McGinnis.  Yes.  He kept me after class.  But I never thought I liked cum.  No.  But it's cold.  It doesn't taste like cum. 
[03:02:00]  It's like chicken.  You could eat it warm or cold.  And it's equally as good, yet different.  Dearest diary.  I so enjoy cold cum.  Eaten from the manly calloused hand of a janitor at my school.  Come on.  Give us more details.  Warm cum can be lapped up.  Cold cum must be chewed and bitten off of the hand. 
[03:02:30]  Nung, nung, nung.  And I'd write that.  Nung, nung, nung.  Hey, can you do like a cum eating thing as a dog tumor guy?  Oh, my God.  I love opening it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Oh, it's nice.  And you're nice callous hands.  It's kind of a, oh, yeah.  Open.  Open it.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Very good.  You got the guy down.  It's amazing.  The thing is this.  Uncanny, I say.  Yes, Jimmy.  What I forgot to, I didn't finish up because Bob rudely interrupted me with his crass talk.  I really interrupted your memories.  Crass.  But after fucking Jimmy's, Jimmy's childhood fucking memories.  But after you, Kenny, could I have a cakey muffin?  Of course.  Why is Kenny still here?  Some kind of marbly thing is fine.  Kenny's working overtime today.  None of those blueberries, though.  I had to do an errand for Mr. Norton. 
[03:03:30]  Kenny, thank you for turning me on to the sounds of the blackberry.  Ooh.  That's the sound you've been hearing all morning.  Like, Kenny taught me how to, like, put a sound on everything.  Great.  Thank you.  So what happened is, after.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Back to you.  Yes.  After the cum is eaten.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  What you have to do is you stay on your knees like a puppy.  What do you have to do?  What do you have to do?  Is you have to peel back his foreskin.  Oh, no.  And clean the head.  Dear.  And then you.  Tiring. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, hold on, Bob.  You stick your tongue out.  And you put it under the skin.  And then you, like, your tongue is caught between the skin and head.  And you, and you circle around it.  And you clean.  Oh, my God.  God damn it.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  The fuck is.  Jimmy.  What is wrong with you?  I'm just speculating.  You're not speculating anything, homo.  You know, I am.  I'm just telling you.  You are totally being, like, yeah, queer.  No, man.  I'm only telling you. 
[03:04:30]  Hey.  It's from Bob's book.  This is book number two.  Jimmy sucks at cock.  Jimmy just has a vivid imagination.  Oh, you really do.  You really do.  Describe it.  I'm very good at that.  What's wrong with you?  Why do you think it's from some kind of past experience?  It's just a vivid imagination.  Yeah, Bob.  Don't be mad at me just because me saying that is giving you a strong sense of memory  association through smell.  Yeah.  Like, you can remember the smell, not only of the cum, but of the stink under the wrist 
[03:05:00]  watch because your nose is in the hand.  It's cock sucking.  It's just, I just want to hold him.  Why?  What's wrong with him?  Oh, shit.  I just want to go and hug him.  Why?  Is that what he made you do first?  These fucking detailed memories are coming out.  In a school parking lot around 4, 4.45 in the afternoon in the fall when the sun just  set in.  He smelled a dirty wrist watch.  It was a sweaty leather band.  Oh. 
[03:05:30]  And like, he had it cupped in a way with the cold cum you were eating it and your nose  was up against where that is because you're so thorough.  He knows the wristband leather.  Yeah, that comes from somewhere deep.  No, not deep.  It's right there.  I think it's just a vivid imagination.  I'm stuck with that.  I can describe a murder the same way.  I've never killed him.  Go ahead.  Describe him the same way.  I killed the guy.  He fell down.  I stabbed him.  And the knife went in the thing and he was like... 
[03:06:00]  In the thing.  Now describe eating cum.  You fuck it on your knees and you smell it before you taste it because your eyes are closed.  And the way he starts out, he gently comes his fingers onto his chin.  He holds...  He lovingly holds...  Like his hand is like a C.  So the cum doesn't pull out and spill.  And he's gently...  The fingers of the middle and the other finger are gently scraping the bottom of your chin. 
[03:06:30]  All right.  Now stop.  Describe a murder.  A guy has a gun and there's a...  The guy was like...  Real quick.  Describe eating cum.  So you're kneeling and you can actually feel because there's no...  You normally would put a pillow down but you can feel the wood kind of hurting your knees  because you've been there for a while because he likes to make you wait for it and beg properly.  Oh my God.  So your knees are sore.  That's your most vivid part of your memory. 
[03:07:00]  It's not even...  The sore knees?  It's the wood floor on your knees.  Describe jumping out of an airplane with a parachute.  It's like the plane is gone and all of a sudden there's wind and you're like fucking just like falling quick.  All right.  Describe eating cum.  What?  Describe eating cum.  How long are we going to do this, bitch?  I don't know.  I've described it.  Until Anthony fucking...  Are you trying to do an Abedin Costello on us?  Shut up.  We can employ him. 
[03:07:30]  You want some C-Span pranks or what?  You bet we do.  All right.  We'll get into this for everybody today.  Fucking hilarious.  It sure is.  Here's the first one.  I'm a good describer.  Riverside, Illinois.  Take the game at the player.  Oh.  What?  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Riverside, Illinois.  Good morning.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Mr. Murphy, I was just wondering if you feel that there's a resemblance. 
[03:08:00]  Caller, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Uh, do you feel that there's a resemblance between your pubes and the hair on your head?  Savannah, Georgia.  Democrat.  Oh.  You know what makes this funny?  It's C-Span.  Yeah.  Putty-duddies.  And no one's watching it.  Huh?  And no one's watching it.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Our next call, Newark, New Jersey.  Go ahead.  Yeah, hi.  I got myself into really bad debt.  I was, uh, paying one credit card off with another for over four years. 
[03:08:30]  Uh, it just went on and on.  And, you know, I mean, I'm, like, really broke right now about to file bankruptcy.  I, you know, I'm trying to get a penile implant.  I need to enlarge my, uh, package to pick up the chicks these days.  Foxford, North Carolina, is up next.  Good morning.  They don't even acknowledge it.  They just go right off.  We go next to Camden, New Jersey, on the Republican line.  What do you think about all this?  Good morning, Brian, and, uh, thank you for C-Span.  Welcome.  When did you lose your virginity? 
[03:09:00]  What do you mean?  How old were you?  I'm not about to answer that question.  When you lost your virginity?  When did you get fucked?  Oh, thanks.  Nice to hear from you.  Always good to hear our callers when they're like that.  That was a good one, though.  He goes, thank you for C-Span.  Yeah.  Thank you for your program.  How big is your cock?  The caller talks to a Muslim pundit.  Moving on to Baltimore to our American Muslims line.  Welcome.  I hope this doesn't bother you, but I've been imagining what you look like naked. 
[03:09:30]  Well, that's Robin Quivers.  I think we're going to move on right to, uh, Philadelphia.  That was a, that was a Robin Quivers audio clip.  Austin, you're on the air.  Good morning.  We're doing open phones.  Hi, am I on the air?  Yeah.  It was?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were, uh...  Totally could hear it.  Listen.  Oh.  Moving on to Baltimore to our American Muslims line.  Welcome.  I hope this doesn't bother you, but I've been imagining what you look like naked.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  Oh, yeah.  Totally.  I think we're going to move on right to, uh, Philadelphia. 
[03:10:00]  That's so her.  Austin, you're on the air.  Good morning.  We're doing open phones.  Hi, am I on the air?  Yep.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  I love that one.  Please, can we hear that again?  Austin, you're on the air.  Good morning.  We're doing open phones.  Brilliant.  Hi, am I on the air?  Yep.  Fuck.  Thanks.  Charlotte.  Good morning.  That is great.  That is like the one.  That's all he wanted to get out.  Fuck. 
[03:10:30]  Fuck.  Like, oh, fuck.  I'm on the air.  Philadelphia.  Go ahead.  Boy, the calls are really fired up this morning.  I just want to say I have a really big penis.  I guess I can suck my...  Let's go next.  You know, it's really very unnecessary.  Next, we go to Washington, D.C.  Unnecessary.  Of course it is.  It's so necessary.  Your viewership is going up.  Toronto, Ontario.  You're next up with the ambassador.  Hello.  Yes.  Good morning, Mr. Jawad.  My question is, do you have a big penis? 
[03:11:00]  Man, I can't believe that guy got back on.  Narocco, California.  Oh, she's flustered.  The same guy.  I love this guy.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, that was great.  Fuck.  Am I on the air?  First, you need the confirmation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Short and sweet.  God, look at McCain.  He's got, like, Vaseline on the side of his face. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  How is...  I mean, look at him up next to Bush.  And Bush has been in office eight years, and he's aged.  And then you feel...  Can you imagine McCain after his term?  That would be awful.  You'd be in a fucking wheeling mouth like Hannibal Lecter, but he'd be in a coffin.  And then you'd feel like the weird part is when you go in for the final clean, you have  to put your face all the way in, so you feel like the muscle of his thumb on one part  of your cheek and the tips of the fingers on the other.  Picture, like, a horse eating oats out of a bag.  That's how your fucking mouth is in the other man's hand. 
[03:12:00]  His hand has been cleaned of all cum, but you want to be a good cum eater and get all  of it.  Do you get any of it stuck in between your teeth?  Don't ask me.  Just do you.  It's up to you.  I don't know.  Do you?  No, you chew it, though.  It's not even really chewing, because it is still a cum.  So you have to make like you're chewing, like you go...  That and you swallow it, like a big boy.  Oh, big boy.  Big boy swallow.  God fucking... 
[03:12:30]  You're a piece of shit.  How'd you get through?  What?  How'd you get through?  Oh, God.  What's the matter?  Goddamn.  You're a good cleaner.  How do you ride a dirt bike?  I don't know.  I never did it.  I thought you could tell a good story.  That was the joke.  Oh.  I don't like the way you took it.  I like it when you explain that.  I know.  Don't switch up the fucking accent.  I know.  It does explain cum eating very well.  Very well. 
[03:13:00]  Absolutely.  We got a quickie here.  The Medvedev Mispronunciation Roundup.  Here, take a look.  Today, a change at the top in Moscow, where Dmitry Medvedev is responding to Russia.  And Medvedev, Medvedev, how am I doing?  Medvedev just nominated Putin.  Dmitry Medvedev.  Take over in that role.  Dmitry Medvedev.  Take that.  Dmitry Medvedev has it.  Medvedev.  Medvedev.  Medvedev. 
[03:13:30]  Medvedev.  Medvedev.  Medvedev.  Medvedev.  Good job by Letterman.  That's a good little bit.  That's a very funny bit.  Do we have Bad Boy Bubby for Mr. Robert Kelly?  Did we ever find it?  We forgot to find it?  No, we just don't.  Oh, we don't have it?  Why are you bowing your nose?  We're professional broadcasters, Bobby.  Until you eat something, you got that metallic taste in your mouth.  What? 
[03:14:00]  That was one of the DVDs left for me.  Huh.  In my DVD, my decimated DVD closet at home.  It was Bad Boy Bubby.  You had a lot of DVDs taken?  Oh, yeah.  How many did you lose?  Did you say?  I lost those in the hundreds.  No.  Oh, yeah.  All of them she took?  Most of them.  She left, you know, my Star Trek ones, I think.  Who took your DVDs?  Huh?  Who took your DVDs?  What do you think?  I don't know.  You broke up a couple times.  I broke...  What?  Somebody took your DVDs. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  You didn't know if it was your girlfriend or your wife.  I didn't know if it was your girlfriend or wife.  What are you acting like?  Oh, DVDs, what?  Back in fucking...  61?  Yeah, 61.  No, the ex-girlfriend.  The ex-girlfriend.  Yeah.  Why would you take all the DVDs?  I don't know.  She had girlfriends helping her out, and I guess they, you know, just grabbed whatever they  could.  Were you mad?  No.  I don't give a shit.  I'll get new ones.  That was the X-Files.  But...  No, I got that, thanks to...  Why wouldn't you have been there when that was happening, Ant?  Danny and Marissa, I got the X-Files. 
[03:15:00]  Oh.  Oh, is that gone?  No, no, no.  I got that.  But she took other ones.  But that I still have.  Were they yours or both of yours?  You know, both, I guess.  What do you mean, you guess?  Both.  I guess we both bought them.  So, you know, it was both.  Were you mad?  You bought them.  No, I wasn't mad, but I'm mad when I go downstairs to the closet to look for a movie, and there's  nothing in there but Bad Boy Bubby, and fucking, you know, bad, bad, uh, uh, porn that isn't 
[03:15:30]  even really porn.  Those chicks with the...  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Playmate of the Apes.  It's like, I want to see some fucking...  I want to see these girls try to act.  They're horrid.  When is this fucking iPhone coming out?  When are they announcing it?  Wow, look at the difference.  When the first iPhone came out last year, it cost $599.  The new version is going to be $199. 
[03:16:00]  For the cheap one.  Yeah, I want the good one.  I want the one with all the memory.  All the bells and whistles.  Well, bells and whistles.  I want the iPhone that has all the bells and whistles.  When is it coming out?  Uh, right there, they're saying fucking, uh, June 30th.  No, it says, what?  March.  Wait a minute.  No.  No, that's, that's...  It's coming out today.  How's your muffin shit, dick?  Oh, no, what happened? 
[03:16:30]  Muffining.  All right.  I like it.  I'm going to refresh the Apple page and see if new information came out.  12 o'clock.  12 o'clock.  Let's work out today, Bob.  Not 12 o'clock.  I don't know if I'm gonna.  I got a really bad headache.  They're not hyping this first?  I have a fucking aspirin.  Don't get mad at me.  I haven't been able to...  I wake up every day at five because of that fucking Iraq shit.  Exactly.  You're not fucking...  How do you get over the fucking...  I don't remember.  What are you talking about?  You went to Iraq weeks ago.  I still wake up every day at like five, six. 
[03:17:00]  In a cold sweat.  You didn't come.  How was your, how was your Iraq trip?  Did you, did you do the werewolf thing again?  Did you see any werewolves?  You know what I found out they were?  What?  Oh, you're finally gonna tell us?  Oh, that they weren't werewolves?  No, it was a werewolf.  The women?  It was.  What are they, Bobby?  Jackals.  Really?  Jackals?  Yeah.  Jackals.  And you're a jackass. 
[03:17:30]  They have jackals.  I swear to God, there's jackals.  Jackals.  Of course there's jackals.  It's the fucking desert.  Yeah.  That's what jackals live.  They do.  They're always talking about, may the jackal rip your body apart.  You know, it's fucking.  But you said.  You said they were werewolves though.  They're jackals.  Well, that's what the guy told me.  That they're jackals.  Jackals.  They were fucking jackals.  How was the gigs?  You know, do you bet.  It was 120 degrees. 
[03:18:00]  In the shade.  In the shade.  I was on stage.  I was in the shade.  It was like nine o'clock in the morning.  And I was like 120.  And we're in this, just on the cement in this field.  And I had black sneakers on.  And 15 minutes into my set, I had to keep picking my feet up.  And you're on fire.  And I go, my feet are on fire.  You were doing step aerobics.  I go, my feet are on fire.  And the guy goes, because you're wearing black sneakers, shithead.  They're very kind.  Were they big crowds?  One, we actually did one show, 4,000.  At Saddam's, the soccer field, where his team used to play. 
[03:18:30]  And actually, where he killed them for losing.  Yeah, where he killed them because they lost.  Yeah, we did.  Did he kill them for losing?  Killed them, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Brought them all in after.  And then killed them all.  And we did a show there.  It was like 4,000 people.  He didn't like losing.  It was very competitive, Saddam.  And then we did a show the very next day in front of 80 people.  In some camp way out in the middle of nowhere.  How did you get around?  Blackhawks?  Blackhawks.  Blackhawks every day.  How are they scary?  They kept the doors open. 
[03:19:00]  And the USO lady almost puked, too.  She had a really weak stomach for flying.  And they come up over the...  They have wires, you know, the electrical wires.  As they're coming up, they just peel it straight up in the air.  And you go up over the...  And then they just let it drop.  So you're literally, for like a second, in the air.  And then you plop down to your seat.  And then they cruise sideways with the doors open.  You're literally just looking at ground.  Why are they flying by?  Because they were flying with it.  They were just showing us they could fly.  They did a 60 degree angle or some shit like that. 
[03:19:30]  Was it scary or no?  Yes.  I had a soda.  Of course you did.  And a turkey.  Yes.  That's funny.  Should I have a palm full of ice cream?  And cum in the other hand.  Cum in ice cream.  That's good.  So wait.  I was doing a callback.  Go fuck yourself.  I liked it.  I'll tell your story.  I fucking liked it.  I gave you credit, you fucking sensitive plop.  I'm just picking up ice cream and coffee. 
[03:20:00]  Jesus Christ.  In your hands.  Bing, bang.  I give you fucking credit.  You go fucking nuts.  Yeah, well, go fuck yourself.  The fuck kind of people are you.  Relax.  What are we having dinner?  What happened?  So what happened?  All right, go.  Nothing.  I've never been to the Blackhawk.  We only did...  Yeah, what happened to your soda?  It just went in my face.  Oh.  What do you want me to do?  So what was the farthest flight you took?  Two hours.  On a Blackhawk?  Two.  Yeah, maybe an hour and a half.  Maybe an hour and a half on the Blackhawk.  But we actually flew over a sandstorm, which was...  I got it on video.  We were flying over. 
[03:20:30]  You could see the front of it and the back of it.  And it's just fucking sand.  Just like the mummy.  It looked like the fucking mummy.  Just sand coming down.  You just said something a lot of people say.  I have it on video.  So?  Yeah, we want to see it.  So many people say that, though.  Oh, I got it on video.  Yeah, Bobby.  Unless it's on the front page of YouTube, I don't think I'm ever going to see it.  No, all four of us had cameras.  You know that camera I brought in a couple weeks ago, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, all four of us had the camera.  We filmed everything.  New Wave Entertainment is actually making a little documentary out of it. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks to Bobby, the whole audience was in the shade.  I'm not that fat.  I know.  The fat jokes aren't much fun.  I know.  You know what?  Half your fat listeners are fatter than anybody on this fucking show.  And you've lost.  And then they meet me and they're like, you fucking not fat.  Really?  You fucking following asshole?  Why'd you have to wreck it?  Because.  You're not fat anymore.  You're right.  Oh.  You were fat in every animation, though.  That was hilarious.  The one in the bathtub was my favorite. 
[03:21:30]  The bathtub was just a little weird.  It was a giant fat.  That's what fucking bugged these fucking faggot fans.  Patrice was all cool and pimped out and everything.  You're such fucking following faggots.  Patrice.  Make him nice.  He's like a pimp.  He's thin.  Fucking.  God damn shit.  Wasn't he thinner than you?  Patrice is wet.  Yeah.  He's always.  But Patrice has a good point.  He's like, yo, man, I look good fat.  You don't.  He's supposed to be fat.  Patrice pulls off being a fat guy.  He's a big boy.  He pulls off fat good.  Yeah.  He's a good looking.  He's a easy.  And now he's dressing like fuck. 
[03:22:00]  I don't know what happened.  I don't know.  He was nothing but sports jerseys and sports hats and fucking like baggy jeans.  Yep.  And sneaks.  Now he has.  And now he walks around with fucking alligator skin shoes.  He's pushing his own barbecue.  Slacks.  Come down to Patrice's barbecue.  It's on 52nd and 8th.  With a feather in it and shit.  I'll tell you what happened.  I didn't like it when I first met him.  But I got to admit, he looks good.  I'll tell you what happened to this stupid asshole. 
[03:22:30]  Somebody said to him, you want to make a million bucks?  You got to look like a million bucks.  Dress like a million bucks.  He's dressing like 48 bucks.  It's not like it's a million.  I mean, that's for him.  No, it's nice clothes.  He dresses very nice now.  He looks.  Black people like to see black people dressed up.  You know what it is?  When he walks down the street, he looks like he's an important guy.  He looks like an important guy.  He doesn't look like a thug.  He doesn't look intimidating to white people.  That's kind of important for a black guy, I think.  He does.  He looks nice. 
[03:23:00]  But let's not get out of control with fucking important.  Important is a suit.  I said, look, I know him personally, and I know he's a piece of shit.  No, it's not that.  But he looks important.  There's a difference between important.  Important is a suit, a nice suit.  He's dressing like the king of comedies, too.  I mean, he's wearing a hat.  He hasn't forsaken his ethnicity by just wearing a regular suit.  He pimps it out a little bit.  He looks like a player. 
[03:23:30]  He looks like somebody that's fucking on the move, you know?  Yeah, and he's not like sometimes when the brothers dress up, they actually go and get  the cheap suit that's all the same color with the same shoe.  He actually, he's, you know, he's...  I don't know who's figuring out his shit.  Because he's got like a plaid pants thing going and stuff like he's doing it himself.  Where did he pull that out of his ass?  Patrice knows how to dress.  How does he fucking know that?  He matched his shoes with actually the liner of his pocket.  Yeah.  See, how do you know that?  I don't know.  You've got to be blind.  Is it like garanimals? 
[03:24:00]  For adults, they have like little animals and you just match up the animals and you know  that the clothes match?  I'm not going to just stop right there.  Oh, okay.  I know because I know where you're going.  Not me, you.  They're all going to just be one animal.  I'm not...  No, see?  Stop, dude.  That's fucking stupid.  You're an ass.  Why don't we go to break?  Yeah, so we can talk about this and laugh.  Why don't we...  Amongst ourselves.  This is getting heated up.  Why don't we have a dog tumor guy.  Well, he imitates dog tumor guy. 
[03:24:30]  Could you take us to break with some kind of like Opie and Anthony fandom thing?  Go crazy, though.  Yeah, go nuts here.  Go nuts.  There you go.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton with Bob Killian's studio taking a break.  XM Satellite Radio.  Go nuts.  Nuts.  Nuts go crazy.  Yeah, like talk about how great this show is like that guy would have done.  You know, I mean...  Crazy.  Ryan says new to three, first of all, but I mean Opie and Anthony, they're fucking awesome.  I mean, Jimmy, he's funny.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, my God. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, man.  Hey, when's this merger going to go on?  I don't know.  Maybe we'll find out after break.  No.  I wasn't feeling it.  All right.  Yucks.  Were you feeling it, Robert?  He lost a little...  He had a lot of energy last time, and then he's kind of forcing...  Were you getting shy or something?  Uh, yeah.  A little creatively dry.  The microphone.  You know, you're leaning over too much.  Bring it up a little bit.  A little shy and also a little creatively dry.  You need water?  No, no, no.  Just, I mean...  I feel like I'm a monkey right now.  A little bit of a douche.  What do you mean a monkey?  Oh, a little bit. 
[03:25:30]  Not a little bit.  A lot of it.  It's funny.  A little bit of a douche.  That's a great word.  Every knee must bend.  Every head must bow.  Every tongue must confess.  Thou art the greatest.  The greatest of all time.  Ella.  Ella.  A.  A.  Yeah, we suck.  Opie and Anthony, y'all.  What happened? 
[03:26:00]  Why is there whispering?  Why is there whispering?  Eyes are burning.  Your eyes are burning?  I know.  How's your face?  Is it hurting?  A little burn.  Is it hurting?  It's killing me.  That old gag.  Waka.  Waka.  Oh, my God.  Ah, shit.  You ever get something put in your lashes?  Speaking of face.  Like, when you lean in and you're blinking too quickly.  And you get, like, a little later, you realize, like, your eye opens and it feels like there's 
[03:26:30]  something sticky.  And you realize you got a little bit of...  Cubsies.  Of hardened, cold cum in your eyelashes.  Then you gotta just go in there and pick it out and it hurts a little bit.  It's like rubber cement in your lashes.  Rubber cement?  Yeah, like a little bit of that cold cum in your eyelashes because you blinked too much.  Yeah.  We're waiting for the answer.  Did you ever hit a...  What would you think a home run would be like?  Hitting.  How would that...  How would you describe that? 
[03:27:00]  A home run?  Yeah.  In my life?  Yeah.  If you just died.  With that.  We got a quickie here.  We got a good one because he went, in my life?  Oh, yeah.  He has to make me say it.  I hate you.  Like a more...  Fuck.  We got a paparazzi dude trying to ask Hulk Hogan about his wife dating a 19-year-old.  Is she dating a 19-year-old?  Yeah, this family is so fucked up.  Is it the basketball player? 
[03:27:30]  No, it's a blonde, bleach blonde kid that looks like it could be their son.  Oh, boy.  What is it with these two of their kids?  Yeah.  Something going on.  It's a weird family.  But, you know what's funny?  Remember when we did the Halloween show and the whole family came by and we all got pictures?  Yeah.  That picture was, like, whatever.  But now when people come over and they see, like, us with the Hogan family, they freak out.  Like, it's like a very valuable picture now.  Oh, look at that.  That's when they were all a big happy family. 
[03:28:00]  That picture of the Hogan's?  Now they hate each other.  Ah, here we go.  Listen to how nervous the guy gets.  Hey, Hulk.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How are you, bro?  Pretty good.  How do you feel about your wife dating a 19-year-old?  You hear how nervous the guy is?  How do you feel about your wife dating a 19-year-old?  Oh, shit.  Don't beat me up.  Please don't fucking kick my ass.  Please don't kick my ass.  Hey, Hulk.  How you doing, man?  Good.  How are you, bro?  Pretty good.  How do you feel about your wife dating a 19-year-old? 
[03:28:30]  How you doing, hon?  Just doing some filming.  How you guys doing today?  Are you aware they're having a party this weekend?  We still love you, Hulk.  Oh, my God.  The guy is scared.  Out of his mind.  Shitless.  What did Hulk say when he asked him that? 
[03:29:00]  He just ignored him.  He's not going to punch him.  Hey, Hulk.  What do you think about your wife dating a 19-year-old?  I was petrified.  All right.  Another quickie.  We're trying to clean up a little bit.  You heard about the Seattle Mariners coach going nuts?  No. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, my God.  Listen to this.  We're playing our ass off every day and got nothing to show for it.  Wait, what?  I'm tired of fucking losing.  I'm trying to get my ass beating.  So are those guys.  We're going to change this fucking shit around and get after it.  And only we can do it.  The fans are pissed off and I'm pissed off and the players are pissed off.  And that's the way it is.  There's no fucking easy way out of this.  Can't feel sorry for ourself.  Got to fucking buckle it up and get after it.  Tired of goddamn losing this fucking every night and we bust our ass. 
[03:30:00]  It's got to be a total team fucking effort to turn this thing around and that's it.  Who is he speaking to?  Just the media, but it's not scary at all.  No, it's not.  Turn it around.  It's the most polite cursing I've ever heard in my life.  Bobby Knight yelling at his team.  That was frightening.  Yeah, that's some frightening shit.  This is my childhood.  Not play fucking games.  That was like a businessman trying to fucking rev up his sales team.  Bobby Knight. 
[03:30:30]  By using some peppery language.  His players were fucking...  You notice none of his players want you to shut up?  Oh my God, imagine that.  Fucking kill him.  Why don't you shut up?  Do we have that?  Can I hear that?  I don't know, Jimmy.  I love that one.  I think Eric's about to speak.  Uh-oh.  Magic happening.  All right, listen to this.  This is my favorite.  I want to play that I'm getting the fuck out of here.  I mean, if you're not going to recover Greg Graham,  if you're just going to let him drive by you,  if the rest of you are going to let him catch the ball outside the three-second lane 
[03:31:00]  and drive all the way in here without one guy challenging him,  then I'm leaving and you fucking guys will run until you can't even suffer.  Now, I'm tired of this shit.  I'm sick and fucking tired of an 8-10 record.  I'm fucking tired of losing to Purdue.  I'm not here to fuck around this week.  Now, you may be, but I'm not.  Now, I'm going to fucking guarantee you  that if we don't play up there Monday night,  you're not going to believe the next four fucking days.  Now, I am not here to get my ass beat on Monday.  Now, you better fucking understand that right now. 
[03:31:30]  This is absolute fucking bullshit.  Now, I'll fucking run your ass right in the ground.  I mean, I'll fucking run you.  You'll think last night was a fucking picnic.  I had to sit around for a fucking year with an 8-10 record  in this fucking lane.  And I mean, you will not put me in that fucking position again.  Or you will goddamn pay for it like you can't fucking believe.  Now, you better get your head out of your ass.  Holy crap.  I would say, you know what?  Coach, go fuck yourself.  Yeah, sure you would. 
[03:32:00]  That's where you sit there and just look up and go,  oh, please let this be over quickly.  Because this is not only your coach.  Everybody knows this is Bobby Knight.  Yeah.  Who is a fucking loon.  Like, he's thrown chairs on the court.  Yeah, he'll punch you in the face.  He'll fucking punch you in the face.  You'll end your basketball career if you fucking...  What are you going to do?  Well, I think the only reason those guys didn't walk out  is because they all thought they could make the NBA.  Yeah, they...  If you're playing in that program  and you know you don't have a shot at the NBA,  you're walking.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[03:32:30]  Ugh.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny turned me on to this.  Jingle, jingle.  What'd he turn you on to?  It's my Blackberry.  Communicating with me.  Bobby, you look sleepy.  Why don't you come work out?  I got a headache.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't want to fuck you in the ass.  There you go.  Roland, Opie, I messed over Mad Men Season 1 DVDs.  It's an awesome show.  You have to see it.  What is that?  You want to know Mad Men?  I am.  What is it?  It's a show about, like, advertisers in the 1950s. 
[03:33:00]  It's all politically incorrect stuff.  It's harassing women.  Politically incorrect stuff?  Jesus, he's a fucking moron.  You said that incorrectly.  Could you just...  Could you speak once without giving us fodder to make fun of you?  Can you do it once?  Politically non-  I love fucking oddy it.  And then Roland writes, also, Don Rickles and Recount.  What's that? 
[03:33:30]  What the fuck does that mean?  Don Rickles is a documentary.  Don Rickles and Recount is a documentary for HBO.  It's not a documentary.  It's a show that they put on.  It's based on actual events.  What's Recount?  What'd you say, Bobby?  It's about...  There's no B at the end of that.  It's not a little fucking spot.  Yes.  Probably.  Supposedly.  Stop.  I'll pay attention to your own fucking sentences.  My sentences are perfect.  I know.  I was the winner of the most perfect sentence boy four years in a row in the Apple Town.  That's why you had to eat cum after you won that competition. 
[03:34:00]  Perfect sentence boy.  I was voted boy most likely to formulate a sentence perfectly 13 years in a row in my home county.  What county?  Apple Blossom County.  Do you know at the...  What's Recount, though?  It's about the vote in Florida?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's politics shit?  Uh-huh.  It was actually kind of interesting, though.  Politics are for ghouls.  Did you see it, Anthony?  I did not see it.  That's pretty funny.  They were actually trying...  The Bush people were trying to stop them recounting.  Were they? 
[03:34:30]  So they sent guys, just regular clothes guys, up into the room where they were counting, and  they started just kicking the lawyer for Al Gore, and they were going, stop kicking me, stop  kicking me, and they were kicking him, trying to start a ride.  Oh, I gotcha.  That was crazy.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, basically, Roland sent over shit for me to watch.  I'm not watching any of that stuff.  Someone says, Ronnie loves Mad Men, and then someone else saying, Mad Men sucks.  And we don't even know what it's about, because E-Rock misspoke. 
[03:35:00]  E-Rock, what's it about, please?  What's Mad Men about?  Advertised in the 50s.  The humor's really politically incorrect.  There's a lot of harassment.  E to the rock.  Go ahead.  It's just a very crude...  It's a cruddy...  Crude.  Oh, sorry.  It's just a very crude show showing the men's lifestyle and mindset back in the 50s.  So it's a crude show showing...  Is it a current show, though?  Yeah.  It just came out last year. 
[03:35:30]  Who stars in it?  But is it a good show showing thing?  Nobody's.  Anthony, what's the movie...  Nobody's.  ...with Tom Cruise with the vampire?  I mean, the devil.  Remember that fantasy one?  Yeah, it's fucking...  What's it called?  It's the devil with Tom Cruise back in the day.  It's fucking the devil boy.  What was that called?  You know what I'm talking about.  With the devil and the big...  Yeah.  The big devil.  Yeah, with the big horns.  Yeah.  It was Willow.  Yeah.  Was it Willow?  Yes!  Was it Willow?  It wasn't Willow.  That was Val Kilmer, you ass.  Can we play Paul Anka?  Because we're doing rants.  Oh, yeah.  Do we have the Paul Anka, E-Rock? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  And it's Bob if he wants to discuss why he's wearing Steve Irwin's shirt.  Wow, what a wreck. 
[03:36:30]  Holy shit, what a pile up.  All right, listen.  That was a monumental bomb.  Oh, did I love that?  Here's Paul Anka.  Oh, God, that was funny.  Here's Paul Anka yelling at his band, right?  Yeah.  His stupid band.  They're making like, what?  Probably just shit.  Shit money.  Getting no credit. 
[03:37:00]  Paul Anka gets all the credit, and this is what Paul Anka did to them.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight.  You're on fucking notice, John.  I gave you a list.  Get half a list that I gave you.  We're choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  Do you understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts.  What a douche. 
[03:37:30]  The guys get shirts.  What the fuck is your problem with that?  Exactly.  Speaking of shirts, why are you wearing the Crocodile Hunters?  That would have been a better segue if he said, the guys eat cum.  I got a quickie before line of the day.  You might have seen this on YouTube, but it's worth playing on the radio.  It's, who wants to be a millionaire? 
[03:38:00]  And joining me now is Chase Sampson, a college junior in Nashville, Tennessee.  And I understand, Chase, that you flew in last night.  You didn't get here until three in the morning, and you haven't slept a wink, huh?  No, I pretty much have coffee flowing through my veins right now.  Do you really?  But as a college student, I'm thinking maybe that's not so rare.  Yeah, I'm up pretty late, mostly.  I'm kind of insomniac, I guess.  But you know where you are. 
[03:38:30]  I'm feeling good.  I'm feeling good.  All right, good, good.  All right, so here he is, the new contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.  Sure.  For $100, Chase, homeowners buy surge protectors to protect their possessions from unexpected surges of what?  Electric current, water flow, air pressure, buyer's remorse.  I will say B, water flow, finally.  What?  Oh, Chase, electric current. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, Chase, I'm so sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Why are they clapping at his incredible stupidity?  Dully got the first question.  The first one is the no-brainer.  They put a little funny answer in there because they know you're going to get it.  Water flow.  A surge protector.  It's against Greek guys. 
[03:39:30]  That's funny.  The movie was Legend.  It's coming in like crazy.  Legend.  I was just, yeah, because the guy right behind E-Rock looks like the fucking devil in Legend.  Oh, Dumb Butcher?  Dumb Butcher.  Is that what that is?  He's got an elongated jaw.  That's fucking Tiberius Caesar hairdo.  That fucking Butcher hairdo is fucking 1,800 years off.  Where is it?  Tiberius. 
[03:40:00]  He sort of has the same hairdo.  Oh, you got a crew cow, can I?  When did you cut it?  Like Caligula!  Like a month ago.  I don't remember.  Sorry.  That's all right.  Nobody does.  That old hairdo.  I couldn't stand looking at my head anymore.  Why?  I don't know.  Too much hair.  All the bedhead every day.  Waking up at 3 a.m.  What the fuck am I going to put it together for?  You smoke a fucking 12 cigars a day?  How'd you get that voice?  Ah, I don't know.  I was born with it.  The ladies love it.  What did the Romans do when they wanted air conditioning?  They sat on ice.  Those fans. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah, the people fanned them.  Yeah, the people, yeah, pull on those chains.  Yeah, the Jews fanned them.  Yeah, and then the fans are on the ceiling.  Hence the term fans.  Yeah.  Is that where it came from?  Oof.  Wow.  Wow.  Can we get Travis in here again?  Because I just want him to get situated.  Travis.  Watch how he gets situated.  Jimmy, take notice.  Here's Travis.  I don't even want to look at him. 
[03:41:00]  Look.  What's up?  Oh, no.  No, see.  No, see.  Now he puts the headphones on.  But he sits down comfortably.  He sits down.  He adjusts his microphone.  He looks around.  Now he's adjusting his headphones.  Do some repelting.  No.  And my water.  I'm ready for professional broadcasting.  All right, thanks.  That's all I wanted to say.  All right.  Let's do line of the day.  It's done.  Nice.  Oh, you know what?  We should have talked to some of the animators today.  Why didn't they call this show?  Because they're faggots.  Mike in Queens.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  Mike, you did the Tom Brokaw animation, 
[03:41:30]  and Bob Kelly said it was the best one of the night.  I liked it.  Did you vote for it to be the...  I wanted to thank Jimmy.  You mentioned it on the radio this morning, man.  Thanks, guys.  You're welcome.  That was really good.  Bobby, did you vote for this one to win it all?  I did.  I voted for this one to win it all,  and then what happened was...  Which one, Bob?  The Tom Brokaw.  Said it right.  Said it right.  Said it right.  It really is.  I fucking hate hanging out with Jimmy when he's smart.  Just when you're smart. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, I didn't get out of the problem.  I didn't even get any tips, though.  The only question.  Yeah.  All right.  Full steam ahead.  Well, good job on your animation, sir.  Good job, man.  It was really funny.  I liked the way you incorporated the show,  and your animation was good.  That's what every one of them did.  It didn't run...  No, not all of them did that.  They all incorporated the show.  No, they didn't.  Which one didn't?  Well, not...  I liked how it incorporated...  Exactly.  ...what Anthony did.  Some of them didn't.  That clown thing didn't fucking...  That was good, though.  That should have been in the top three.  Oh, dude, that stink.  I'm so glad he's all angry. 
[03:42:30]  Stop being angry, man.  We did the best we could.  We've been mad at the whole fucking contest,  and who won, and everybody else.  Go fuck yourself.  Sounds like sour grapes.  You're a fucking crybaby.  Is that how you make wine?  Thank you, Mike.  It's your stupid clown thing.  The sound that didn't match up.  People talking.  I didn't know who the fuck they were.  It wasn't even from our show.  Yeah, the people talking wasn't from the show.  I haven't seen it.  You had a quick clip of fucking Dave.  And then they added their own audio.  And then your own audio.  It sucked.  Well, they worked hard.  Why the fuck would you...  Shut up, Bobby. 
[03:43:00]  I'm calling this guy an asshole here.  Help me out, Hendry.  Fucking famous animator.  What the fuck kind of people are they?  Fucking cum eaters.  I don't like the fact that...  I got to split, man.  I got you back to work.  I just wanted to thank you guys for saying that.  Godspeed.  All righty, you split.  Good job.  I don't like the fact that...  Danny brings up a good point, too.  It was also a rip-off of Tom Goes to the Mayor.  Yeah, it's this weird...  I don't even know if it's still on anymore, but it used to be on Adult Swim, which is a  cartoon network late at night. 
[03:43:30]  And the animation style is exactly that of Tom Goes to the Mayor.  It's not even trying to be any different.  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  He sucked.  Did the listeners vote on which one they thought should have won?  That would be kind of interesting to see.  Jimmy, who did you vote for?  I voted for the Slaughterhouse just because I thought it was the best animation.  Right.  Right.  I liked a lot of them.  I loved Patrice's.  I loved...  Just the animation-wise, I thought that one was like a film.  It was an animation contest. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, but it wasn't as funny the second time.  Again, that's not his fault.  I'm just talking about the work he did.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And that's, to me, what should have won.  Again, I think playing the first one did hurt him.  But I like Coke Logix.  I loved it, too.  The reason why I like Coke Logix, he has his own style of animation that he's kind of created,  which is like, wow, I haven't seen that before.  He had a nice twist on the whole Ramon thing, though.  It was unbelievable.  And Steve looked just like Steve.  I mean...  Yeah.  It was...  You actually think you do a good Pesci impression. 
[03:44:30]  No, I don't.  Yes, you do.  No, I wasn't doing...  First of all, I wasn't doing Pesci.  I was doing Angry Baby, so go fuck yourself.  Angry Baby.  You don't even know.  Liggy, liggy.  He doesn't even know.  What's Angry Baby?  I know Angry Baby.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Do Angry Baby for us.  It's been a while.  What the fuck kind of...  I fucking hate people.  Fucking mobile spinning around.  Fuck this.  It's an Angry Baby.  Fuck, I just shit my pants, you cocksuckers.  He was doing Pesci.  No, it was fucking...  You don't even know.  That's Angry Baby.  Angry Baby, Jim.  What is Angry Baby?  You don't know, man.  Explain.  Educate me.  Just don't speak out of turn.  Educate me. 
[03:45:00]  No fucking...  You're pissing me off, you fucking ass.  That's Angry Baby.  Angry Baby.  See?  I know, too.  Joe Pesci's a little different.  Do Joe Pesci.  Do Pesci.  Angry, you fucking...  You fuck.  What am I, a clown?  It's different.  Joe Pesci.  It's a little different.  A little different.  Angry Baby is fucking...  Hey, what the fuck's going on?  That's Angry Baby.  Joe Pesci is fucking...  Angry, you fucking...  I do, and I'll tell you who it is.  Hey, fucking...  What the fuck kind of people are they?  Angry Baby.  Thank you.  You're right.  I switch it up.  All right.  Then I close my eyes.  Try to trick me now.  It's a fucking deer.  We hit a fucking deer, man. 
[03:45:30]  Uh, Joe Pesci, that's right.  Angry Baby again.  No, I'm Joe Pesci.  I know.  What the fuck's wrong with you, Jim?  I don't know.  You're a stuttering prick.  You want to do the line of the day and get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  Go get our iPhones.  Opie and Anthony, animations on YouTube, and hopefully we'll talk to more of the animators  tomorrow.  There's a bit of controversy out there.  A bit of controversy.  Some are saying that Ecstasy of Gold didn't have enough animation.  I agree.  And that it was more, uh, what, uh, like, uh, stills and stuff. 
[03:46:00]  Fucking drawings.  That's true.  Stills and stuff.  Slideshow.  You know what?  I didn't vote for it to win.  I liked it, though.  It was good.  I think I did vote for that.  They don't know I'm pointing.  I think Steve the Bear going to work was...  I like Steve the Bear.  That was my favorite.  And I like Tom Brokopp.  Danny, which one did you vote for?  Top animation.  I actually, uh, the Ecstasy was my favorite one.  Ecstasy of Gold.  It was good, but you know what you guys...  We didn't...  I didn't think it was actually part...  I thought it was just the opening of the fucking show.  You were just mad because you were portrayed as a really big, fat guy in a tub. 
[03:46:30]  Not...  Actually, very, very fat.  Steven S. from Bayshore said,  Every time you saw yourself as a fat cartoon character, you looked around really annoyed  and bothered.  No.  And confused.  He used the word confused, too.  Like, what?  People say, what?  What is this?  I'm going to punch him in the face next time I see him.

[03:47:00]  I want to thank the one fan for stopping by today.  You have fun today?  I had a lot of fun, Opie.  Thank you.  How sad is that?  One guy.  I think it's cool that he came down and sat in the bleachers and enjoyed the show.  The show was for him today.  It was all about him, and you let him be part of it with that cool character.  That is a good character.  You got something there.  What did he say?  I'm feeling like a douche?  A bit of a douche.  Yeah.  A douche.  A bit.  That's having a touch of the douche.  A touch of the douche?  Feeling a little douchey.  Here is the first runner-up line of the day. 
[03:47:30]  Carrie Bradshaw, also known as Sarah Jessica Parker, with all sorts of flowers.  And then she's...  Is she eating them?  She's...  That's fucking great.  Nice.  That was good.  Next.  Please.  What?  Next, please.  So you didn't give her the ring?  Or ring?  The ring. 
[03:48:00]  Oh.  You know.  I'm not going to add fuel to any speculative fire by justifying that question with an answer.  I thought I caught you in a weak moment.  No.  I don't have any of those.  Anthony.  Uh, let's go to the next...  What are you doing?  I just like to whisper.  He whispers to me.  I know.  It's creepy.  Next.  Yeah, let me eat your cup.  The time already.  Here is another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:48:30]  Jeep, jeep, jeep.  It was, um, I don't know, just some guy apparently having sex with a tranny.  This was very hurtful.  And very funny.  I'd rather be fat than every girl I'm with has chest hair.  Yeah.  Yours.  Congratulations.  You too.  Ooh, a little volley.  That was a little touche.  A little badminton going on.  It's to you.  Yeah, yes.  Back at you. 
[03:49:00]  Back at you with a little badminton shot.  Wait for it.  It's just floating down.  It's a peri-thrust.  Right back to you with a little mustard on it.  Ooh, hey.  I gotta back up for this one.  And back head.  Back to you.  Bobby, where are you gonna be?  I'm gonna be at the Treehouse Comedy Club in Danbury, Connecticut.  Danbury.  This weekend.  Call 203-268-5857.  Or don't.  Hey, Jimmy.  Listen, not all those fucking money in the bank, okay? 
[03:49:30]  It's Saturday night.  Bobby's doing one show only.  Yeah, so come down and see me.  How was your fucking...  Did you have a good crowd for the Count Basie?  Count Basie wound up being all right.  But I think, you know, a lot of ONA fans showed up, which was good.  And there was...  You know, I gotta tell you, too, there's a lot of ONA fans in Iraq.  A lot of guys.  Yeah, I know.  And I'm talking...  We know from them a lot, actually.  It was kind of creepy because I was in one of those, you know, where they have the Predators  and all that stuff.  A lot of top secret shit.  They brought us into one of those little bunkers.  And these guys...  They're showing you top secret stuff.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:50:00]  They showed us...  Wait, you saw top secret stuff, Jimmy?  Yeah, the Predator...  I saw the Predator cockpit, a lot of stuff.  Fuck, I thought I had some on the bottom.  No, of course you didn't.  You saw top secret shit.  No, it was a bottom secret.  They took a...  Easy fucking cum eater.  Fucking...  See you coming around, though.  They, uh...  They, uh...  Yeah, they have all the Predator shit.  I know, you're right.  I'm trying to fucking get through it.  But then I walked up to it.  Dude, we listened to you on ONA.  Yeah, and then what?  It's just good to know that fucking ONA listeners are fucking running Predators.  I know, the ones that are looking for fucking Bin Laden.  Yeah.  We haven't found them. 
[03:50:30]  They're too busy on Whack Bag.  I think fucking that animation...  That's just like Pesci.  We get it.  That wasn't...  That wasn't Pesci.  Who was it?  Fucking Angry Baby.  Wait, let me...  All right, go ahead.  Give me one.  The fucking Christ, you fucking prick, ya?  Uh, that's, uh...  Angry Pesci.  That was Joe Pesci.  You're right, man.  You get it.  All right, give me another one.  Fucking Henry, what the fuck?  What the fuck kind of people are they?  All right, you were gonna trick me.  You were gonna do Pesci as Angry Baby.  Right.  But that was Pesci. 
[03:51:00]  That was Pesci.  Now, ready?  Yeah.  What the fucking, Opie?  You fucking crazy, you fucking asshole.  That's Angry Baby, kind of doing a Pesci thing.  Right, you're right.  So he knows.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Uh, good.  A nice carriage ride will do the trick in a hundred degree weather.  Yeah, the horse is thrilled about that.  It's like, why don't they just get camels to pull these things?  I think they could take the heat a little more than these poor horses.  Oh.  That was very funny.  That was more, uh, poignant than, um, funny.  Beautiful and funny. 
[03:51:30]  Hey, where are you off to today with, uh, the lovely Joe?  I, um, I, uh, don't have any plans.  Are you gonna see your girl today?  No, nothing, you know, definite.  So you're doing the, uh, the cancer kit?  No, I gotta see what's going on out there in, um, out there in, uh...  Pillow Town?  Huntington.  You're doing a kid fundraiser today.  No, I wasn't doing anything.  I'm just, I know, you know.  Say hi.  Yeah?  To John Schobe.  All right.  Did you play in polo today? 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, I got a polo match.  Yeah.  Getting pretty good.  On my trusty steed.  Did he play polo?  Dude, that guy's lost it completely.  He used to be cool when he drove a shit car and now he plays polo.  Dude, does he really play polo?  Because now, even when he's goofing around, it kind of sounds like he's playing polo.  Time for a polo.  Would you like Anthony less or more if he played polo? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  I guarantee they do that.  Oh, that'll be theirs.  Them other poles.  That fucking poles.  You get a pole and shove it up your ass.  Oh, hey, come on.  Oh, okay.  I mean, come on, do it.  Oh.  Here.  I got a fucking headache.  Comes.  Props.  Master Poe better have my truck downstairs.  Downstairs.  Downstairs.  Master Poe better have my truck downstairs.  Master Poe better have my truck downstairs.  I hope Master Poe wasn't waiting for one lousy guest, no offense, sitting on that fucking 
[03:53:00]  those bleachers.  One douchebag sitting on the bleachers.  One one trick pony motherfucking dumb voice doing douchebag.  How about, hold on.  No offense.  No offense at all.  Waiting for him.  Instead of getting your car?  Instead of getting my truck.  Let me tell you something.  Yes.  The best Poe story of the day is that he announced to the entire staff that you weren't coming  to work today as you were sitting at your computer.  Yeah.  I pull up.  He's not there. 
[03:53:30]  What a dummy.  Poe's usually there when I pull up in the morning.  And he wasn't there.  So I'm like, hmm.  So I go upstairs.  I give Kenny the keys.  I go, Kenny, could you run the truck to the garage?  He goes, okay.  And then, who was it?  Who got the email?  Steve.  Steve got it.  It said, oh, no, I didn't come in because Anthony is not coming in today.  Anthony is out.  Like, really?  As you're sitting there.  When did that happen? 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  I thought you were staying in Tennessee.  No.  What I think it was was that when Steve sends the Monday email over the weekend, one of the  first lines from it said, you know, Anthony's musical adventure in Nashville.  So I think he interpreted that as you were going to still be in Nashville.  Oh, that I would still be there.  Yeah.  I think that's why that happened like that.  Okay. 
[03:54:30]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's your song.  All right.  My blackberry's going off.  God.  Roland.  What is Roland writing now?  Uh, Star Trek rap featuring Prime Directive and Galaxy Class.  What is this?  It's on YouTube.  What does that mean?  Star Trek rap?  Uh, yeah.  It's some dudes that are rapping about Star Trek The Next Generation. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, stop with the rapping, you kids with the rap.  All right.  I've had it with him.  Fuck.  Go.  Fucking.  You're shitting out a tree.  Just triple lager.  Fuck yourself.  Send.  All right.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Come on.  Bobby just got excited by the word comes.  What would you think a home run would be like? 
[03:55:30]  Hitting.  How would that, how would describe that?  A home run?  Yeah.  In my life?  Yeah.  If you just died.  That was fucking true.  It's all, um, politically uncorrect stuff.  Ah.  Uncorrect stuff.  Politically uncorrect.  God almighty.  The fuck are you, Ryan?  Yeah, I love the way you said, in my life?  Yes.  If you just died.  Let's go for the early. 
[03:56:00]  Anthony.  The early.  It's fucking $7.50.  I meant to say, what is it?  I meant to say.  You ass picking asshole.  Take your hand out of your asshole.  I meant to say quick.  It's $11.09.  And take your hand out of your asshole.  I'm not ant shit for brains.  I said, take your hand out of your asshole.  It's actually on the outside of my cheeks facing out.  I might have been picking.  Oh.  I don't pick my ass.  I guarantee that fucking iPhone won't be out today. 
[03:56:30]  No, it won't.  It's going to be out tomorrow.  It said it's expected to be sold for.  What do you think?  They fucking get those in and price them and everything.  That thing ain't going to be out for fucking fuck.  It's already in.  It's already in.  I talked to a friend of mine.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not.  It would be up on the website already.  Talk to a friend of mine.  It's not.  Talk to my friend of mine.  Talk to my friend of mine.  It's not.  It's not.  It's not infinity.  I won.  I said infinity.  I said infinity.  Stop it.  Black magic.  Double black magic.  What the fuck kind of baby shit is black magic?  I said infinity.  Dude, I said black magic that undoes your infinity and then triples my black magic. 
[03:57:00]  Can't.  Can't.  Infinity's infinity.  There's no ending it.  Yeah, there is.  Mine went for double infinity.  And then into a black hole and then came out the other side.  No.  How about eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  Catch it.  Oh.  Can't do that one.  Suspension.  All right.  Let's get out of here until tomorrow.  And we get our iPhones.  Please enjoy the rest of your evening as we will.  We will see you tomorrow on the fantastically entertaining Opie and Anthony program. 
[03:57:30]  And we're out.  Who can enjoy a full moon on an empty stomach?  Now, no one has to.  Wendy's late night.  Classic single.  Classic double.  Classic triple.  Eat great.  Even late.  Now, the manager's corner with the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best.  Your area Oldsmobile dealers. 
[03:58:00]  Anderson Olds.  Schaefer and Strominger Olds.  Lee Oldsmobile.  Metro Olds.  City Olds.  And Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you. 
[03:58:30]  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark and you can't make any goddamn mistakes.  Well, certainly this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Well, Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan, 
[03:59:00]  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the fucking ninth.  So if this cocksucker didn't mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lady's coming from,  rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out of the fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street, 
[03:59:30]  she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball Fucking Network.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you?  Find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  That virus you're always talking about. 
[04:00:00]  El virus, the Opie, and Anthony. </pre>
