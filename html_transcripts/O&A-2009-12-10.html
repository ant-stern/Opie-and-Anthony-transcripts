<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in vulgar, sexually explicit banter before pivoting to a discussion of several trending news stories.  Their commentary focused heavily on Tiger Woods' infidelity scandal,  the extensive media coverage it received, and Jesse Ventura's 9/11 conspiracy theory show, which they criticized for its lack of credible evidence and questionable sources. They analyzed clips from Venturaâ€™s show, highlighting inaccuracies and unreliable interviewees.  The show then shifted to MTV's *Jersey Shore*, specifically a scene featuring Snooki being punched.  Opie and Anthony debated the show's edginess, the potential backlash, and MTV's promotional strategy, concluding that the controversy likely benefited ratings.  They also discussed the repackaging of *Cops* to focus on taserings and shootouts, lamenting the lack of genuinely interesting or edgy programming on television. A listener called in with a humorous comment about the hosts' phrase "come dumpster."  The hosts briefly speculated on the future of "year glasses" before mentioning upcoming guests, including Patrice O'Neal, and briefly touching upon Barbara Walters' list of fascinating people.  Crude language and sexually explicit content permeated this portion of the broadcast.

The show continued with a segment heavily focused on Sarah Jessica Parker's appearance, featuring disparaging remarks from hosts and callers, comparisons to animals, and analysis of heavily photoshopped images.  The discussion returned to Tiger Woods' infidelity scandal, with E-Rock and Fat Matt, an intern, role-playing explicit text messages between Woods and Jamie Grubbs. The hosts discussed casting choices for the role-play and expressed frustration with their staff.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Norton's appearance on Jay Leno, followed by a lengthy and extremely vulgar discussion about the "Perkins Waitress," allegedly involved with Tiger Woods. This portion included studio guest Patrice O'Neal, who participated in the discussion, which was filled with offensive language and crude sexual humor.  The segment concluded with a debate between Opie and Patrice O'Neal on whether men acquire material possessions to attract women.

The next segment delved deeper into the relationship between material success and attracting women.  Opie and Anthony shared personal anecdotes about their own lives, discussing how acquiring nicer homes and cars impacted their lives and relationships, with callers adding their own perspectives and experiences.  One caller mentioned the guilt associated with a better lifestyle than their parents had, and another suggested that confidence, rather than wealth itself, was the key factor in attracting women.  The conversation then transitioned to a debate about 9/11 conspiracy theories, particularly focusing on Jesse Ventura's show. Patrice O'Neal and Anthony discussed the plausibility of claims regarding the World Trade Center collapse, analyzing clips featuring interviews with individuals who claimed to have found explosive residue and heard explosions before the plane impact.  They expressed varying degrees of skepticism, and the segment concluded with a discussion on whether some conspiracies might stem from government incompetence.  Patrice O'Neal remained a studio guest throughout this segment.


The final segment of the broadcast continued the discussion of 9/11 and the Iraq War, questioning the justifications for both events.  Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal debated the roles of fanaticism, government incompetence, and conspiracy, speculating about Saudi Arabia's involvement and the use of "collateral damage" as a euphemism.  A significant portion focused on Jesse Ventura's investigation, including claims about "super thermite," and a fireman called in to refute Ventura's claims, offering an alternative explanation for the building collapses.  The hosts played audio clips from Ventura's investigation, including footage of him at JFK airport, interspersing them with wrestling jokes.  Numerous callers shared their diverse perspectives, including a caller whose son died in Iraq.  The show briefly mentioned an upcoming "homeless shopping spree" and concluded with further speculation about future show topics and wrestling-themed jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, devious.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of cash.  We're just dicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus.  And I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Hilarity.  That virus on the intro there is fantastic.  We've got to get the virus back on the show soon.  Do we?  Yes, we do.  Good morning.  Good morning.  How's everybody out there?  Good?  I hope so.  You're not talking back, though.  I know.  That's the thing about radio.  It's such one-way communication with our listeners.  When are these people going to talk back? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Hello?  Wait a minute.  Give them a minute.  We've been trying to make contact with them for 14, 15 years.  And they're still not talking back to us.  Oh, we got the phone.  But we have to go to those.  No, no, no.  It's not just like we talk into the mic and then our headphones, we hear you.  Yeah, we want to hear you through our headphones without doing anything.  Yeah, set something up, dummies.  Oh, my God, this Tiger Woods thing.  It doesn't go away.  It doesn't get any less scandalous.  It gets more by the day. 
[00:02:00]  So you check out the trending topics on Twitter.  Oh, God, what is it?  Well, today's trending topics are like, I don't know, Now Playing, Celebrity Passwords, Christmas,  Glee, Norway, just dumb shit, right?  But Tiger Woods is on there all the time.  Right now, he's not.  So then you click on one of these trending topics, and you can see all the people talking  about that topic, right?  Oh, nice, yeah.  So I've been doing that with Tiger Woods.  And every other tweet is, enough already with this Tiger Woods. 
[00:02:30]  And I'm thinking to myself, you're adding to the problem.  If you're sick of the Tiger Woods thing, then just don't tweet about it.  Yeah.  I'm so sick of this.  Next, let's move on to something else.  Enough with Tiger Woods.  They were talking about it on the news on the way in, and how even people that usually  aren't caught up in tabloid scandals have been kind of drawn into this to some level  or another, you know, whether people are like, oh my God, I can't believe this. 
[00:03:00]  You know, the Tiger Woods, the Woods News, or just a passing comment, like, holy shit,  Tiger's really fucking alive.  Well, you know, everybody's kind of gotten caught up in it.  Well, my favorite part is, it went from TMZ, The Insider Entertainment, to mainstream news.  And now you've got, like, Anchorman going, and Tiger said, I will wear you out.  With that news voice reading the text messages.  This, I'd love to know how many days in a row this is.  On the cover?  And if it's setting or going to set some kind of record. 
[00:03:30]  Well.  Here in New York, we've got, of course, the two papers, the Daily News and the New York  Post, and every day it's been a tough story.  I mean, the 9-11 stuff has to be number one by far.  We'll get into that because Jesse Ventura did his, what, conspiracy show on that last night?  Oh, conspiracy?  I did my truth show.  Shut it.  Can't wait to get the clips on that.  It is.  Can't wait to get the clips. 
[00:04:00]  It's fabulously awful.  Yeah?  It's horrific.  The guy is a complete tool.  And we've noticed, just in the three or four times he's done our show,  if you look at the older videos of Jesse, up until the recent one where Jimmy and him  went at it, you can see there's a drop-off.  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  Insanity.  And when he was on our show, what he's preaching all the time is taken verbatim from this show 
[00:04:30]  that he's doing.  Right.  So he's just taking it verbatim and spitting it back out.  And most of this stuff is told to him by what could be some of the most uncredible witnesses  I've ever seen in my life.  You know, we were going to do tireship, but now I need to know.  What are you talking about?  Well, one guy, one of the emergency workers on the site was there, clearing out the rubble, 
[00:05:00]  things like that.  Never really said where he was from or what he did.  Didn't say he was FDNY, NYPD, fucking Port Authority, nothing.  This guy just had a hard hat on, a respirator, and he's cleaning up shit.  I don't know what he does.  Maybe he was one of them welders or something.  But he's telling this story about how, oh, he was there one night when they found the  black boxes, and the FBI came swooping in and took those black boxes away. 
[00:05:30]  And he's just out there saying, yeah, they recovered the black boxes.  They recovered them.  Well, that's good enough for me.  Wait.  He was on our show two appearances ago.  I remember, he's like, and I talked to the guy that found the black boxes.  He didn't find them.  He said he was there with a friend of his, and they saw the black boxes, three of the  four black boxes.  There's two per plane at the Trade Center site. 
[00:06:00]  And how they were whisked away by the authorities.  Anyways, another guy, it's Jesse outside of the Javits Federal Building here in New York.  Where is that for people that, is it, is it, I guess it's downtown.  Is it close to ground zero?  With a federal, I'm not even, you know, I'm not even sure where the federal building is.  No worries.  But it's a federal building, and it does house the FBI New York field office and stuff.  One of them, I'm sure. 
[00:06:30]  And Jesse goes, it's one thing to make a phone call or send an email, but it's hard to deny  someone eye to eye.  And he walks into the building, and they show Javits Federal Building.  What is he, Michael Moore?  That's what he's doing.  He walks in.  Did he have his bullhorn?  Was he yelling at buildings?  He's yelling at buildings.  He shakes hands with the guy, and then it goes, blah, blah, blah.  There's his name.  It says veteran FBI agent.  Oh, shit.  FBI veteran. 
[00:07:00]  So instantly, boof, I hit the pause button, and I look this guy up.  He retired in 2002.  Seven years ago.  Before anything really, you know, 9-11 info really was coagulated yet.  Right.  And Jesse's talking to him, and they never presented him as anything less than a current  FBI agent, which he was not.  He's retired since 2002.  But you have to do that research. 
[00:07:30]  Exactly.  When it would have been very easy for them to just put a graphic on the screen.  R-E-T.  Retired FBI agent.  R-E-T.  Sure.  In the little fucking brackets, and you're set.  But they didn't do that.  And the way they talked about it was like he was an FBI agent, and Jesse's grilling him.  Jesse's giving him the business.  He is so bad at this, and it's so hokey.  He went down to ground zero, looking for clues, Opie.  Eight years later, he's looking for some clues to the thermite paint. 
[00:08:00]  Who is he, Dice?  Yeah.  Where's the hat?  He went down to ground zero, and goes, well, they sure got rid of the evidence pretty quickly,  didn't they?  He didn't say that.  He did.  He said, Rudy Giuliani was proud of how many tons of metal they'd taken out in such a short  period of time.  And it's like, well, yeah.  They were trying to get Manhattan back in working order, you dunce. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And he goes, where did they take that metal?  Oh, they made a ship out of it, but nowhere where we can investigate if there's thermite  or super thermite.  I think Jesse Ventura is a hoarder.  He's very depressed that they got rid of the mess.  He's trying to hoard.  He's trying to hoard steel.  Meanwhile, the fucking metal was at fresh kills for I don't know how long.  For years.  They pumped it out there, and then they took it.  Then they take it to hangar.  He goes, this is Hangar 17 at Kennedy Airport. 
[00:09:00]  Uh-oh.  What happens at Hangar 17?  Oh, my God.  What happens?  Are there aliens living in there?  Dude, it's fucking Roswell East, according to Jesse.  I don't know what's going on, but he walked up, and he goes, guys, come here.  Come here.  And looks in a window.  A window that's completely open and exposed and sees some rusted metal from the trade  center.  Big beams that are recognizable.  You can look at them and go, I've seen those.  I know that's...  And there's no secret that they're storing metal in there. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, they don't know what to do with it yet.  Exactly.  That's all.  And he goes, look at the dust on that.  I'd love to test it for super thermite.  I swear.  He said that.  Super thermite.  Not clark thermite.  Super thermite.  And then there's spidey thermite.  He said spidey thermite?  Mild-mannered thermite is now super thermite.  Okay, there you go.  He is an asshole.  And then he tries the door, and he goes, well, yeah, this door's locked. 
[00:10:00]  Well, yeah.  It's Kennedy Airport, dummy.  There's plenty of locked doors there.  I would say just about every door is locked.  Every single door is locked.  Safe to say.  Is locked.  Except for the bathroom door.  And those aren't even doors.  They're the little zigzags that you go through.  It's not even a door.  Every door is locked.  Because they know if it's a door, it has to be locked.  It's got to be locked.  So they don't even have doors on the restrooms.  He was surprised to find a door at Kennedy Airport that was locked.  We've got a lot of travelers today.  They're listening to us on the way to the airport. 
[00:10:30]  Call us if you find a door unlocked at the airport.  Yeah, go ahead.  Check a few doors and see how long before they pounce on top of you.  He wouldn't, and he wouldn't stop.  And the narrator, we've got to get clips of the narrator that comes in before the commercial starts.  Yeah.  Because he goes, they just call him, next.  The governor goes on the assault in a building and tries to gain access.  I was denied again.  And he's down at ground zero. 
[00:11:00]  He goes, yeah, they cleaned it up.  I'd love to find one piece of metal we could test for super thermite.  Dude, it's been eight years.  This fucking, you know, aside from the big ditch that they're working in, I don't think you can find any evidence.  No, not at all.  And he's talking with people who are supposedly family members of the dead that were around the ground zero site.  And of course, you get a few of them that are, you know, really about government conspiracies. 
[00:11:30]  We've seen them.  We've walked the streets and have come up to us.  Well, he only spoke with those people who are like, something happened.  This is a murder scene.  This is a crime scene.  And they cleaned it up.  They didn't even do an investigation.  What?  What are you?  He's insane.  Unbelievable.  And with his bobblehead doll fucking.  They were looking at all that shit they were pulling out of there.  Of course they were.  They were looking at how the metal melted and whatnot. 
[00:12:00]  And the tests they do are ridiculous.  He did a super thermite test.  Had someone do one, of course.  They put a steel beam out.  And then they kind of set a fire on this contraption above the steel beam.  And the fire fell on the steel beam.  And he goes, as you can see, there's no effect.  And it amounted to, I swear to you, roll up a piece of paper and put it on a metal I-beam and light it.  Right.  And see what happens.  Nothing happened. 
[00:12:30]  Then he painted it with some super thermite and lit a fire and dropped it on the beam.  And now it's sparkling like a, because what it amounts to is the same stuff as a sparkler.  And so it's sparkling and getting hot.  And he goes, notice the increased heat that super thermite gives off.  And then Jesse goes into this whole thing of how they could have turned it into paint and had people who were working in the building all the time just painting the walls. 
[00:13:00]  And it's like, well, what did they do?  Knock the sheetrock down in these offices and start painting supporting structural beams?  Right.  I mean, if he wants to go with the theory, he should say that we're just thermite painting all the walls.  No, the 9-11 commission, that's a theory.  Mine is the truth.  He's a lunatic.  And last night's show, I swear, how I didn't fire around into the television is beyond me.  Unbelievable. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, fun stuff.  When we get clips, we'll play them.  But like I said, the narrator is classic, the way he describes Jesse.  Like he's in the war room with his staff.  He's nuts.  Yeah, he is crazy.  He's getting cuckoo.  He's crazy.  Crazed.  All right.  Well, we're going to get the clips and then we'll go over it.  Oh, yeah.  I think we've got to talk a lot of TV today.  Like you were saying just before the show, there's too many shows out there right now.  Too many shows.  I had to miss Lawman last night.  Lawman.  I had to DVR it, but I didn't watch it. 
[00:14:00]  I call it junk TV.  The Jesse shows junk TV, Lawman, and Jersey Shore.  Were we on this early or what?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Now the papers are showing stills of Snooki getting punched.  Snooki getting slammed in her head.  The papers are on it today.  I just want to remind people, we were talking about this on Monday.  Well, I believe we are the leader.  We're ahead of everybody.  I believe we are the news leader.  Yes.  So, and I guess the guy from MTV saying, look, man, sorry you're offended, but we're moving forward with this show. 
[00:14:30]  This is the biggest thing MTV had since Puck put his fingers in the peanut butter.  I swear to you.  There is no fucking way.  People are finally watching MTV for something.  I mean, how sick of everyone is everybody of road rules, challenge with the fucking real world people, real world.  Because real world turned into like the beautiful people in a mansion.  Just partying their asses off.  Yeah, yeah.  A big party thing. 
[00:15:00]  It was cast so people would be more interesting.  And it's presented as the real world.  Now, I'm not saying this isn't cast to have a certain type of people on the show.  It absolutely is.  But at least that's what it's supposed to be.  The real world stopped being the real world after like season two or three.  Yeah, because then they just threw alcohol at these people and you just watched drunk kids.  And they were like.  Like the first few real worlds.  They were models.  They were this.  They were that.  They weren't regular people.  Well, not at first, man.  The first couple.  That's what I'm saying.  There were some beasts.  I'm saying at first it was real people. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  That's why it was the real world.  So they just grabbed up some people, threw them in a house, and saw how it went.  And then it turned into like fucking watching one of those stupid Laguna Beach shows or fucking  the O.C.  So who gives a shit how does she head clock that one?  I was telling Ant before the show, if they drop this Jersey Shore, then that should be  a sign to all of us that there's nothing you're going to see on TV that's interesting,  different, edgy, outrageous.  It's done. 
[00:16:00]  It's done.  Why do we have to have a goody two-shoe fucking TV?  Why?  Who decided we need that?  If some drunk son of a bitch wants to punch that chick in the face.  The princess of Poughkeepsie.  Snooki.  Snooki.  If it wants to punch her in the face and they want to fucking put it on a show and show  it, I'm there.  And this episode is next week.  Don't MTV do the right thing.  And the right thing, believe it or not, is to let this show roll.  He fucked.  Let this show roll. 
[00:16:30]  That clocked her.  Yeah, it was a nice fucking...  Wow.  Kind of like a Hulk.  That is a man punch.  You punch a man like that.  Well, it's Snooki.  Look at his follow through.  Dude, his arm is straight when he's done.  He didn't pull that punch.  And he has psycho eyes, but...  Oh, he's a lunatic.  It's not that he's got...  He's not a psycho, though.  I think he's just ripped.  I think he's just hammered.  You think that's it?  Oh, yeah.  And the guy got arrested and blah, blah, blah.  Well, he should.  Of course.  So why can't we show this on TV? 
[00:17:00]  Why?  Good.  It's...  It's...  Yeah.  It doesn't...  I don't watch this and go, oh, I'm gonna go punch some chicks.  And Anthony's Italian.  Have you talked to your family about this dumb show?  No.  Anybody in your family give a shit?  Not yet.  I don't think they're onto it yet.  Maybe my sister.  Right.  She'll probably be onto it, but...  But you got some hardcore Italians in your family.  Are they gonna be outraged by this?  No, not at all.  They give a flying fuck.  Exactly.  There's more important things.  One show doesn't define a group of people. 
[00:17:30]  Well, cops does, but...  But I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'm hoping MTV doesn't buckle.  You know, they've lost a couple sponsors.  Supposedly some of the staff members over at MTV are getting death threats.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Shit like that.  Stop it.  There's some protests going on, you know.  You know, speaking of cops quickly, I like how they're...  You know they're repackaging that show?  The what?  Cops.  Oh, really?  Instead of sitting through an entire episode where it's like, oh, great, this is, you know, 
[00:18:00]  a traffic stop and it's nothing that fun.  They're doing, like, the best taserings episodes.  Oh, really?  Where it's nothing but the fucking situation ending in a tasering.  Nice.  And they're doing, like, gunfire where it ends in a shootout.  Mm-hmm.  It's like, that's pretty good.  Because the one thing about cops, especially now, because it's been on for so long, and  even if you've seen a lot of the episodes over and over, you go, oh, I've seen this  one, there are some parts of it that are just like, all right, I understand. 
[00:18:30]  You know, here's the shot of the guy in the car again going, yeah, well, I got into  law enforcement about 10 years ago and it's just a great way of life for me.  Yeah, who cares?  Shut up.  Who cares?  Pull out your taser and down this guy.  Are they going to do a whole show on criminals hiding under baby pools?  Under baby pools.  That was my favorite.  It's great, though.  I like how they're repackaging it into little thematic things, yeah.  Very smart.  So then you got Jersey Shore, the new episode's on tonight. 
[00:19:00]  Now, I don't know.  We had two or three cast members ready to be on this show from Jersey Shore.  And then the publicist got involved and MTV got involved, so now we're having a real  tough time.  We had Snooki and the situation ready to roll, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  They were ready to roll.  We want to talk to Snooki.  Can we talk to Snooki on our Facebook, see if she could just jump on the phone with us  today?  Yeah.  Want to try her again?  Tell Snooki to call us.  Because then all of a sudden they're like, well, we can't do anything unless the publicist 
[00:19:30]  says so.  We won't punch her.  So then we, of course, did the right thing.  We start calling the publicist and then they're not returning our calls.  Calls.  We were stonewalled again.  I believe it's a conspiracy.  Shut up.  Stonewalled.  He's always getting stonewalled.  Dope.  All right.  Yeah, that would have been nice to have been able to just bypass all that bullshit because  the second they get involved, it, uh, exactly what, what you said. 
[00:20:00]  It just becomes this dragged out bullshit of this management talking to this and that  and that.  And then the whole thing kind of goes away.  We had him.  Yeah.  We had the situation ready to come on our show.  Jesse, the situation Ventura.  Well, he's got some situations.  He's got, well, he's, of course he gets the bottom of, he's in the war room talking to  his staff.  And then, um, like somebody will say, well, uh, uh, governor, they call him governor. 
[00:20:30]  Well, governor, apparently there's somebody in Salt Lake City.  Um, uh, scientist, uh, that, um, knows a little bit about this, uh, thermite thing.  You, get on a plane now to Salt Lake City.  Wow, he's just got money, huh?  Oh, dude.  And then they show, like, stock footage of a plane taking off.  Oh, really?  Yes.  The guy's probably on a Greyhound bus for a week.  Right.  Like, sitting there scratching his balls going, this sucks.  He's got to hitchhike across America. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, he's hitching for Jesse.  Man, when I was a kid, I really was into the conspiracy thing.  Yeah.  As a kid.  You know, I think by the time I was in high school, I was starting to question all this,  like, oh, come on.  I am of the school of thought that the simplest answer is usually the answer.  Now, I'm not saying that it's always the answer, but it usually is.  You can't take so many historic situations and think every single fucking one of them is  a conspiracy. 
[00:21:30]  Pearl Harbor was a conspiracy to get us into World War II.  Right.  The Gulf of Tonkin, a conspiracy to get us into Vietnam.  9-11 conspiracy.  We do love war, though.  This country does love war.  Yes, we do.  And then, of course, he talks about how plans were laid out on the table in 61 for us to fake,  the United States government, to fake an invasion by Cubans so we can then invade Cuba.  Right.  With public support, because then they will think Cuba has invaded. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  And there are papers that show that this did happen.  Right.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that every administration is using this tactic or that  it was used on 9-11.  I believe the government knew some things.  They obviously knew things.  They knew some things.  I think it was more their stupidity than their genius that put us in the situation.  As far as the event itself, it went down exactly as we saw it on TV. 
[00:22:30]  When they talk about how thermite paint took down these fucking buildings, and I'm watching  video after video of two planes flying into the buildings, and the buildings falling right  at that point where the planes hit, where it weakened the building, and that's where the  initial fall started.  You don't have to fucking...  Whatever you're selling me, I'm not buying it.  Right.  Info leading up to that...  Building 7 wasn't even hit by a plane.  Yeah, it was hit by the World Trade Center. 
[00:23:00]  It might have weakened the foundation a little bit.  Dunce.  And I can't even imagine...  I mean, the ground had to be just rocking and rolling down there as these things were  falling.  Huge fires, too, in the basement of Number 7.  It was just all that stuff.  Yeah.  No, I mean after the thing.  Oh, yeah.  I've been down there a million times since, but we were lucky to be...  Wow.  How many days later?  Like a few.  Yeah.  The pile was still, I don't know, like 10 stories high.  Yeah.  When I went down there. 
[00:23:30]  That's when I had my credentials in my vehicle, so I was driving through the battery tunnel  and making the right turn right up the West Side Highway.  Amazing.  And...  Just...  Yeah.  Just amazing.  I could stop in and say, toodaloo, hello, toodly-doo, and I guess I should have grabbed  some steel and gave it to Jesse.  Shit.  Hey, you want to wake up Tiger Woods?  Let's wake up Tiger Woods.  Tiger?  Is he...  Is he snoozing still? 
[00:24:00]  I think so, yeah.  Wow.  Let's see if Tiger Woods is still snoozing.  Hmm.  Wow.  Yeah, that Ambien.  He's sleeping here.  Yeah.  Tiger.  Tiger.  Tiger.  Oh, what?  Do I have a tournament?  Daddy?  I mean...  What?  I was...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  Where's my...  Where's my wife?  Where's...  Oh, my God!  I might have knocked up one of these whores!  Oh, my God!  I might have knocked up one of these whores!  Holy shit!  My life is ruined!  What?  Sleep is the best, man.  You just forget everything. 
[00:25:00]  You do forget everything.  Oh, you just forget...  See, we talk about...  Dreams and shit?  Yeah.  Where you wake up from some of these dreams and go,  Oh, my God!  That was a dream!  And you feel...  You feel like a million bucks.  Yeah.  You're like,  I'm not a serial killer!  Oh, God!  Oh, thank God.  It is amazing.  The FBI isn't after me.  Yeah.  I have a recurring dream of a fucking...  I get in this weird, giant fucking plane,  and it starts taking off down what amounts to a... 
[00:25:30]  I don't know, something that's been carved out of the woods.  And I look out the window, and the wingtips are almost hitting the trees on each side  of this dirt runway, and it's like a 747.  Yeah.  And then the thing kind of takes off, and you feel it lurch over to one side,  and you're like, oh!  And then I wake up and go, oh, I'm not in a plane crash.  Holy shit, thank you.  But in Tiger's case, it's working...  Tiger's case, it's the other way around.  It's working the other way, which is just horrible. 
[00:26:00]  It's the other way.  Tiger thinks it's, you know, he's out of trouble.  Yeah, in his dreams, you've got to think he's just winning, you know,  the fucking British Open over and over again.  He's setting all the records.  Oh, it's another Ambien.  Let me take an Ambien.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Oh, there's...  Thank you.  The green jacket is mine again.  I'm such a successful golfer.  Oh, what?  Oh.  Oh.  Finally, a good night's sleep. 
[00:26:30]  Honey?  Honey, I would...  Why is this side of the bed...  I don't...  Oh, my God!  300 texts of me talking about my cock!  Oh, my God!  300 texts are in the paper now!  It's a novel of texts about me wanting to fuck!  Poor Tiger.  Oh, he can't wake up from this. 
[00:27:00]  They're talking about love...  Love child.  Oh, yeah.  Or love children, I guess.  Love children?  Well, it came out, he didn't want to wear...  He didn't wear a bag, I guess.  Didn't like the bag.  Didn't like the bag.  You got to appreciate that, but...  And then sex tapes.  But they keep hinting about sex tapes.  Is it some of these bras in, like, sex tapes?  Yeah, yeah.  Or is it a tiger sex tape?  Tiger.  They're writing it in such a way, they want you to think that maybe, possibly, there's a  Tiger Woods sex tape.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'm not really sure.  I think it's a sex tape of one of these mistresses. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, really?  I don't know.  But what about the pictures?  Well, this is the latest.  Here's your bullet points.  Of those pictures I wanted to see.  Tiger Woods insulted his wife in an email to Rachel.  Who could tell?  Rachel.  Who could tell?  Oh, what have we got here?  Every day since it happened.  Wow!  Oh, wow, okay.  Holy moly!  Starting from the second page, right?  Yeah.  Wow, we got all the front pages.  Tiger's worst drive.  World's top golfer injured in bizarre 2.30 a.m. car wreck after claims of Roe with wife. 
[00:28:00]  Next day, Tiger hides his tail.  Golf great ducks cops as a fair rumor swirl.  Look how it starts out.  This is great.  Holy shit.  It's like a little timeline.  Yeah, it starts out with just his accident.  Right, and then it goes on to...  And that's it.  Tiger's cryptic admission as car wreck questions linger.  I'm not perfect, he says.  Party world of girl and tiger tempest. 
[00:28:30]  Will Mrs. Woods stay?  Then it takes a turn for the worse.  Tiger begs forgiveness as the world wonders.  Will Mrs. Woods stay?  Then the next one.  Show me the money.  Tiger and Mrs. talk in millions in renegotiation of prenup.  Tiger in trouble.  I don't know her.  Six maniac.  What does six maniac mean?  When will it end? 
[00:29:00]  Three more tiger lilies telling sex tales.  Tiger's other New York party girl.  Holy shit.  Home sweet home.  Tiger's humiliated wife by Swedish mansion.  Rumors swirl she's gone.  Mama mia.  Mama mia.  How do you say her freaking name?  I still don't know.  Elon?  Elin?  Let's go with Elin.  Elin.  Elin's mother collapses as new tiger babe emerges and lust in the woods reveal Tiger's 
[00:29:30]  racy text to Rachel.  Oh, you know what six maniac is?  Oh, wait.  That's when they thought it was up to six.  Oh, okay.  That's when they thought it was only six.  Wait, that was only one paper.  Yeah, that's one paper.  Then we got the other one.  Paper.  I'm a cheetah.  And then it just has numbers.  This one says six.  This one says nine.  What's the official number up to?  Eleven?  I think it's up to eleven.  Now they're hinting at some broad in Britain.  This is worldwide.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:30:00]  Worldwide.  Well, the British Open, what's he supposed to do?  What's he supposed to do?  Not have sex?  What?  Are you crazy?  It's Tiger Woods.  This guy likes fucking.  But it's a major.  Yeah.  You should be sleeping.  You think you should be snoozing?  You should be snoozing when it's a major.  All those times where it's like, what's wrong with Tiger today?  He's not making those putts.  What's wrong with Tiger?  He keeps driving.  He off into the fucking.  Remember the knee injury where he was limping around the course?  Yeah, he's limping all right.  He sure is. 
[00:30:30]  He pulled his testicle.  He pulled a testy.  He probably had his caddy.  All right, look, man.  I need a favor.  Yeah.  I need you to smack my knee really, really hard.  I'm having so much sex I can't even walk straight right now.  But I got to show the world that it's actually a knee injury.  You tell that pig waitress I'm gunning for her.  That Perkins waitress.  You tell that Perkins waitress I'm gunning for her.  Okay.  All right, here's your headline. 
[00:31:00]  So you got Tiger Woods insulted, insulting his wife in an email to Rachel.  Yeah.  Basically saying that he didn't have a connection with his wife and he has a connection with  this Rachel brought.  But he was also worried because he hinted in some of the text messages.  We'll have to do a whole segment with the text messages after the break.  But basically telling Rachel, I don't know if you're really into me because it seems like  you like famous people in general.  Oh, shit.  So I'm a little confused by you.  Yeah.  A ton of text messages between Tiger and the other girl, Jamie Grubbs, are released. 
[00:31:30]  Grubbs.  We'll be reading all those in a little while, too.  Jamie Grubbs apologized to Elon last night on Extra.  Are we going to get that?  Wobble doodle.  Wow.  Yeah, like she's sitting at home listening to this fucking whore apologize.  Oh, everything's fine now.  Yeah.  Thanks.  All right, Tiger.  I'm coming back.  Porn star Holly Sampson bragged about having sex with Tiger in an online video last year.  Did you see that?  I got that in front of me.  No, no.  That's something.  Last year?  And no one picked up on this? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, wait.  Last year?  Yeah, we're pretty close to this new year.  Right.  Well, I'm confused because someone said it was only a few months ago, several months ago.  So, the last year might be wrong.  I think it's a few months ago.  She's on some internet show with her girls, and they're all just topless, just kind of gossiping.  Yeah.  And the one girl that has now come out as one of the broads basically, not basically, said,  yeah, I was with Tiger Woods.  And no one picked up on this.  Just thought of some dumb whore, you know, yapping. 
[00:32:30]  This is how it went down.  Who else did it?  Is that it?  I'm trying to think of who else.  Um, I've had, oh, Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods?  Yeah, I've had Tiger Woods, dude.  Tiger Woods, um, yeah, that was amazing.  How did that happen?  Well, a friend of mine, Brent Bolthouse, he runs a lot of...  Okay, obviously.  You know who Brent Bolthouse is.  Yes, of course I do.  Okay, so he used to be a friend of mine, and he was good friends with one of Tiger Woods' assistants.  So, me and my girlfriends, we did a bachelor party for Tiger, and, uh, and it was amazing. 
[00:33:00]  And then he picked me to go in the room and have some, you know, whatever.  And I have to say, he was really good.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  And you're fine with his name?  I don't care.  I don't care.  No, he's, he's like, he's like the whitest black boy you've ever met in your life, okay?  His life is gorgeous.  I mean, you're gorgeous.  Teeth are perfect, and he's like the perfect gentleman.  He's beautiful, beautiful everything.  Just beautiful.  Awesome.  Good story, huh?  Yeah.  This was several months ago. 
[00:33:30]  Several.  Way before the car crash, and no one picked up on it.  And the reason they didn't pick up on it is because, you know, she has her tits out,  so it ruins her credibility.  Like, when Katie Couric is giving you the news, her tits aren't flopped out for everybody  to say, so you take her a little more seriously.  My witness's tits were out.  Right.  Not credible.  Yeah, this would be tough in a court of law, as they show this tape.  Well, we can't believe you, because your tits are out.  Dude, that's, uh... 
[00:34:00]  Isn't that amazing?  What is that?  May 26th, I guess, right?  Oh, they're saying May 26th, Dan?  Oh, that's a while ago.  Obviously.  How did this skate buy?  That's six months almost to the day, right?  Damn.  Six months almost to the day.  I mean, the more you read about this, you know, this was going on back in 2007, 2006,  2005.  It seemed like everybody knew.  Yeah, it's just all over the place.  This Jamie Grubbs, I fucking hate her.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  She is the one capitalizing the most.  Yeah, yeah.  She's going to have the hardest fall when this is all over.  The other ones are kind of like, kind of getting a little payday, but then they're kind of  like, eh, I'm trying to not be in the spot, like, too much over this.  You don't see the Perkins waitress anywhere, do you?  Where's the Perkins waitress?  Is she still working at Perkins?  Perkins.  She put Perkins on the map.  Man, what is that about? 
[00:35:00]  Because most of these girls' quality as far as looks go, right?  Dude, yeah, yeah.  It's funny seeing the montage of the girls, and then it ends with the Perkins waitress.  I mean, this is not even a close second as far as ugly goes to the Perkins waitress.  Mindy Lawton, is that her name?  With her sex photo, that is just horrendous.  She is not Tiger caliber.  You look at Tiger's wife, and then look at this chick. 
[00:35:30]  What are you doing that night, Tiger?  Was he just like, was it real late?  Maybe there's those nights that even Tiger Woods can't just walk into a club and go,  Oh, God, look at her.  And just go like, hey, it was beer goggles.  I mean, if it's Perkins, I used to eat at Perkins a lot when I was living in Buffalo.  That's the end of the night.  Yeah, that was late night eating crap.  Yeah.  You don't even remember what you were eating because you're so hammered.  It's like fucking the Jack in the Box drive-thru chick here on Long Island or something, you know?  We used to go out drinking. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  So you got that.  And then only 38% of people polled have favorable opinion of Tiger.  My opinion is still favorable of Tiger because I just care.  Oh, shit.  Because I just care about him as far as like how amazing he is on the golf course.  Can he?  Give a shit.  Yeah.  Can he still hit that ball?  Down from 56% last week and 83% favorable opinion on Tiger in 2007.  83.  And that's what's going to hurt his endorsements.  I want to know. 
[00:36:30]  Because all these companies look at this shit.  The favorable opinion.  Yeah.  To see who they want to, you know, go with.  Who are the people that didn't like Tiger then?  When it was 83?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, yeah, fuck that guy.  I guess Phil Mickelson has a very large family.  Yeah.  It's a little golf humor for everybody.  And then some dumb congressman from California dropping his effort to honor Tiger with a  congressional gold medal for sportsmanship and breaking down barriers in golf.  Well.  Why?  If you're giving the fucking, you know, award out for what he does on the course, then 
[00:37:00]  why not?  Yeah.  Well, it's a little hard now to.  But why?  Drag him in.  Who gives a shit what these guys are doing in their personal lives?  You know how that operates, though.  They got to go, well, you know, any other time.  But now, a lot of negative.  Oh.  God damn it.  Sean in North Carolina's got it.  You know that Tiger had that fucking LASIK like I did?  Oh, yeah.  This is one of the girls he had before the LASIK procedure. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, the Perkins waitress.  Yes.  Pre-LASIK.  Pre-LASIK.  Boy, that's the commercial for LASIK, isn't it?  No kidding.  He's like, wow, she's hot.  Imagine, yeah, before Tiger Woods had LASIK, he was banging broads like this.  They show the Perkins waitress after LASIK.  Yeah.  And they pick your favorite broad.  Oh, they show that fucking girl.  I can't even keep track of all the names and everything.  Well, Jamie Grubbs is the one that's all over the place.  She's all over. 
[00:38:00]  Rachel's the.  That junger.  That junger chick.  That's the one.  Right, and she really thought that Tiger actually liked her for who she was.  Oh, my God.  You were just a calm dumpster.  Tiger, or Mindy Lawton is, Tiger says, Tiger is very well endowed.  That's Mindy Lawton, the Perkins waitress, saying he's got a big hog.  And it looks like she's seen a lot of cocks.  Oh, my God.  Coming through that Perkins? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  She's probably seen a few miles of cock.  I can't get enough of her, man.  Oh, she's horrible.  She's the worst.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll get into the text messages next.  Oh, nice.  Also, we got, oh, here's the Jamie Grubbs.  Oh, here's the apology.  Why don't we do that?  Because we were just talking about it.  What is doody?  Jamie Grubbs apologizing to Tiger's wife on Extra, because that's what Tiger's wife is doing.  Yeah.  She's checking out all the tabloids as they rip her husband a new one. 
[00:39:00]  Let's see if anyone's apologizing to me.  What would you tell his wife, Elin, if she was sitting right here?  I mean, I have no words to explain, you know, what I have done to her or her family.  I guess I would be deeply sorry for never considering her during the whole process.  I'm not going to ever say what I did was okay.  You know, that is the way I felt. 
[00:39:30]  Whatever.  Stupid whore.  If she was sitting right there next to her, she wouldn't get a word out before that fucking  crazy blonde ripped her eyeballs out of her head.  Hit her with a fucking golf club.  She'd go Viking on her ass.  Oh, hells yes.  She's got some Viking in her.  Put that fucking hat on with the horns and just start beating the shit out of her with  a mace.  Give her one of those Viking funerals?  Yeah.  Send her off and burn her.  Right?  They burn the ship or something?  They float her off in the water burning. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  That's what she wants to do to all these hewins.  Let's say hi to Mr. Coffee in South Carolina.  Mr. Coffee.  Yes, sir.  Good morning, fellas.  Good morning, Mr. Coffee.  By the way, I like that come dumpster phrase you say.  Well, we used to say that one a lot in the old days.  On regular radio, by the way, too.  Yeah.  Yes, sir.  For real.  But I want to say that Tiger Woods, he didn't just like sex.  He loved it. 
[00:40:30]  That's the truth, man.  Just amazing.  All right, we'll do the text messages next and get into some of the things.  We got the Jesse Ventura stuff.  Yes.  Barbara Walters, 10 most fascinating people of 2009.  We might have to take a peek at that.  Oh, yeah.  When I heard who's number one, wow.  Yeah.  And a lot of lists because it's the end of the year.  Yeah, they do the year-end list.  Top 20 albums and songs of the decade.  We might have to do that.  There might be an interest there. 
[00:41:00]  You know what struck me?  You know what struck me last night?  I'm thinking, I remember the turn of the millennium, you know, you got the year 2000, and we were  goofing on everyone out there in Times Square with those 2000 glasses.  You know, it's two, three zeros, and you look through two of the zeros, right?  Sure.  And then we were making fun of those things, and they look all stupid.  You look like a dumb fucking rube with them on.  And then we were saying, what year does that stop?  And then we had to go through all the years, and I realized last night, this New Year's 
[00:41:30]  Eve is the last year it has to stop.  Yeah, because the one's going to cover your left eye.  The 11, you can't look through an 11.  11.  You could just, no, 2010, you're still going to be able to do it.  No, because look at the glasses.  No, dude, the one is going to be over your nose.  The two is off your eye.  The first zero is on your right eye.  The second zero is on your left eye.  So that's going to now be a one. 
[00:42:00]  Guaranteed they'll put a one on the bridge of your fucking nose.  Oh, they'll squeeze it in?  They'll squeeze it in and put the two zeros on your eyes still.  Yeah, but then it'll be lopsided.  Maybe it's going to be curved.  Whatever.  They'll figure out, because there's still two zeros to put your eyeballs through.  Well, if that's the case, they'll figure it out for every year.  See, look.  Wow, Danny found one.  Oh, you found one already?  Not practical, it says.  It's a 2010 one.  See, I said this.  See, it's over.  The guy's eye is covered with the one.  I say it's over, Anthony. 
[00:42:30]  I say you will see 2010 glasses that still work.  Look at that guy.  All right, look at this.  What?  People are already testing out their 2010 well, Opie.  What do you want to do, break it out in Times Square and not have it work?  It'll be pandemonium.  I think these are artist concepts.  Oh, are they?  Of what it should look like.  Of what it should look like.  That guy's got, see, he's got a little one at the bridge of his nose and the two.  But once you hit 2011, I mean, Jesus Christ.  If they figure it out for 2010, then they're going to figure it out for every year after that. 
[00:43:00]  I don't know.  See, look.  There's what you're going to have.  No, it's lopsided.  I know.  The two is way over.  There's no way to do it.  You're right.  Technically, it's over.  Technically, it's over.  You're saying they'll figure it out, though.  They will figure it out, and it will be lopsided.  It will be lopsided.  But 2011, there's no way.  No, it's already over.  I'm saying no.  Yes, it's over.  We just showed you.  It's lopsided.  Look at the compound down there. 
[00:43:30]  It's just a pair of glasses with 2010 above it so it'd be against your forehead, and you  look through the two regular glasses.  That might have to be the way to do it.  You can't have lopsided glasses.  You're already a little lopsided on New Year's.  I don't know.  This is going to be a...  Who knows which design they're going to pick.  But, yes, I was toiling with that last night.  Toiling.  All right.  Quick break.  Do we have any guests today?  We've got Patrice coming back.  That's cool.  Patrice, boy, did he love watching Lawman last night. 
[00:44:00]  He was twittering.  Loved it.  And we saved some of those clips from yesterday, so we'll do more Lawman clips as well.  All right.  We're babbling.  We're going to regroup, and we'll do the text messages next and other things.  Stay there.  That could be a problem.  Nothing worse than turning on the TV and seeing a major car accident on a major highway.  Yeah, the old LIE right there in Flushing, Queens, Stan. 
[00:44:30]  That's pretty close.  You think that'll cause backups today, Ed?  Uh, nah.  It's not anywhere near rush hour in New York.  It's not like we only have, I don't know, one road that comes into the city.  At this point, if nothing is wrong on the LIE, you're on the brakes every two seconds.  From now until probably noon.  Yeah.  And with an accident, forget it. 
[00:45:00]  You're fucked.  Why is it that just about every roadway in America, they have it figured out where everything  is smooth sailing until one car breaks down?  Oh, look at the line of cars.  Yeah, it just goes on forever.  Oh, you don't want to be there.  You know what I'm saying, though?  Yeah.  They're fine, but one car goes bad, then we're all fucked.  That's it.  We can't figure that one out?  I like Brian Regan's, uh, it's a bit, but I think there's something to it.  Yeah.  Where you get helicopters with big magnets, and if you break down or whatever, this fucking 
[00:45:30]  helicopter swoops in and takes your car off the highway?  Yeah.  Come on.  I think there's something to that.  I've talked about this one before, too.  When people get into a little fender bender, you don't have to stop in the road and discuss  the fucking problem, because many people are under the misconception that you can't move  the car, or you're committing some kind of fucking tampering with evidence crime.  The police want you off the fucking road. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  They don't want you standing in the middle of the road trading insurance cards over a  fender bender.  During rush hour.  Off the road!  Exactly.  Anthony, I want to thank our friend at www.tdd.com.  We were talking about the Jersey Shore.  Did MTV go too far?  The Jersey Shore incident with Snooki getting punched?  Snooki.  And there's a fine reference in here.  Listen to this.  It's possible this fancy gentleman was offended by a young lady wearing a hat indoors, and 
[00:46:30]  in this clip he's saying, Madam, please remove your hat in accordance with Jim Norton's  hat removal service.  Wow, that's cool.  He fucking loves the show at www.tdd.com.  Show your support for that website.  Hat removal.  It's just as good as all the other sites doing the celebrity thing.  Yeah, and then there's a link there.  You know, you click on Jim Norton hat removal, Jim Norton's hat removal service, and it goes 
[00:47:00]  to the famous fucking clip and the discussion of the famous clip that YouTube, like, shuts  down all the time.  Yep.  For some reason, they don't want that clip up there, which is bullshit.  But more likely is, what the fuck was that?  MTV is getting tons of very justified criticism for their new show, Jersey Shore, and not just  from groups offended by what they consider Italian stereotypes, but because of the preview  clip during the closing credits showing female castmate Snooki getting punched in the face 
[00:47:30]  hard.  Domino's Pizza has already pulled their ads from the show, and others are threatening to  do the same.  I'm not PC homo, but it's sort of amazing they would show a clip of a girl getting punched  in the face.  Although, to be fair to the dude, I wanted to at least smack her in the head, and I was  barely even paying attention.  So, smart on MTV's part.  I mean, that's the last clip in the preview reel, and now we're all talking about it.  I mean, we're all talking about Jersey Shore. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, new one tonight, and then that particular episode is next week.  Wow.  Yeah.  So everybody's going to watch tonight.  But what would TylerDurtonDo.com, also known as WWTDD.com.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for the help.  You can't even say, she slipped that punch, it was fake, it was...  I've seen this punch now a thousand times, and it is just a man punching the way he would  punch another man for calling his girlfriend a cunt. 
[00:48:30]  I've gone through different stages of favorites with this clip.  Yeah.  Like, at first, I thought my favorite was the guy's face that he makes before he punches  her.  Yeah.  Then I thought my favorite was her actually being punched.  But now my favorite part is the guy in the middle, because he knows it's coming, and  if you just watch his face, he kind of winces when he sees the guy pulls back, and then  starts to shake his head after contact is made like, oh, no.  No.  And he put his arm in there, too.  And now that's my new favorite part of the clip.  He's like, oh.  The guy is ripped.  The guy is so fucking drunk. 
[00:49:00]  His eyes are just, like, not focusing on anything.  How do you belt a girl in the face like that?  I need to know what she was saying.  She had to have been talking so much shit.  Dude, what could she possibly have been saying?  Snooki talked shit.  Yeah.  This is no surprise.  Dude, but talking shit, to the extent where a guy punches you like a man, that is some  shit.  Hey, she took the punch.  She kind of did.  She could take a punch.  Did she get knocked out? 
[00:49:30]  Have we seen past this point?  They show little footage, maybe two seconds afterward, where you see the guy getting arrested,  and a quick shot of them tending to her needs.  Because that looks like they'd have to wire her fucking jaw shut punch.  No kidding.  Damn.  Well, we'll find out next week.  I swear, I would be on the fucking ground, knocked the fuck out of that punch.  MTV, do not cancel this show.  Please, don't cancel this show.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  You're going to see what happens.  Like I said, this thing...  Nothing happens with boycotts and all that other crap. 
[00:50:00]  Hang in there.  When was the last time MTV had a show anyone was talking about?  This is one of those things that they're not going to pull out on this one.  We'll get other sponsors.  Trojan or some shit.  Yeah, it's the first show I'm paying attention to in a while from MTV.  Hey, we're getting into the Tiger Woods text messages.  Kevin from Connecticut, she got punched like Connie Corleone.  She certainly did.  The page before the text messages, just a quickie, Sarah Jessica Parker, she is doing all sorts of shit. 
[00:50:30]  She's wearing all sorts of stuff.  Yeah.  So you're distracted from the fact that she's not a good-looking broad.  Dude, she looks like Nancy Reagan in a miniskirt.  She's got a giant head, that skinny fucking lanky body.  And I just...  I cannot find her attractive.  Call it my personal preference.  Call it...  How fucking no, man.  Everyone would think she's a pig, but I... 
[00:51:00]  She was...  She was...  She kind of was attractive in L.A. Story.  Really?  Yeah.  Right, Dan?  I'll go with you on that.  Let me see.  She was kind of attractive.  Let me see.  And then...  It's so hard to judge now, because now you know what she looks like now.  Now.  She was kind of attractive.  L.A. Story.  And then, uh...  Does Sarah Jessica Parker ugly come up?  Is that one of the first things that come up when you put Sarah Jessica Parker in?  No.  Oh, wow.  Pocus Pocus comes in, though.  That's kind of...  That's kind of what we're heading toward, Ant. 
[00:51:30]  Hair.  What we're going to tell the folks.  Yeah, true, true.  Um...  There she is in, uh...  What, L.A. Story?  Let me see.  Um...  I liked her in square pegs.  Jesus, of course you did.  Teasing of course.  Of course you did.  I didn't even like her in that, and that's saying a lot.  I can't really find a picture of her from L.A. Story days.  But she...  She's wearing hats and scarves and long coats and... 
[00:52:00]  She can't accessorize enough.  Exactly.  Big fucking flowers and...  All sorts of stuff, so you're distracted from the face.  She's wearing like a red silk fedora.  Right.  She's got like a red silk Indiana Jones hat on.  And then a purple purse and a long black coat and...  I don't know.  Trying to show a lot of leg to take away from...  I bet you she has misshapen boobs as well. 
[00:52:30]  Just misshapen.  Wasn't there a...  Oh no, that was her ass or her thigh when she was walking and the skirt pulled up and you  saw like...  There was some kind of weird thigh meat going on.  All right, let's see there.  That's her...  That's her in L.A. Story.  Yeah, it's before her features took on this...  Yeah, her nose just...  Weird thing.  Her nose is growing like a man's nose.  And her chin...  She's almost like American werewolf in London.  That effect where she sat there and just...  Her nose and chin grew.  And what the fuck's up with Steve Martin? 
[00:53:00]  He looks exactly the same.  And this movie's got to be 20 years old.  Especially when he went gray at fucking 19.  The guy...  There's something to be said for that.  Maybe it's not that bad a thing.  Right.  Everyone gets used to it.  Like Anderson Cooper.  Yeah.  You know?  I don't know how old the guy is, but when he's fucking...  So...  60, he's probably going to look the same.  So you go...  You look old at an early age and then you don't have to worry about shit.  You don't have to worry.  You're just old for the rest of your life.  There you go.  So the Sarah Jessica Parker picture.  But then Anthony was saying that TV commercial... 
[00:53:30]  And I'm with you on this one.  What the fuck are they doing to her face?  There's a commercial because she's like one of these...  I don't know what the makeup is.  One of these cover girls.  Whatever the fuck it is.  And they show her.  And they did some kind of wizardry.  Wizardry.  With her eyeballs.  Her peepers.  Now she's got blue eyes.  But this was fucking like...  Like avatar effects.  Blue eyes.  They did to this...  Not only that.  They scrubbed her face with CGI.  Yeah.  The whole face is just scrubbed down. 
[00:54:00]  Yes.  They CGI'd the shit out of her.  And made her eyes so distractingly crystal blue that you can't take your eyes off her eyes.  And the skin around her eyes as well.  It's all just way too smooth and way too...  I don't know.  Not human.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, there she is with her...  All right.  Misshape it now.  Well, her arms are out.  How old is this?  What is this from?  It's from 91.  Oh, see?  91.  That's a long time ago. 
[00:54:30]  See?  She doesn't show her boobs.  I think she was the only one that didn't show her boobs on that Sex and the City show.  That says a lot.  That awful fucking...  Ugh.  What?  Those awful square tits from...  What's her name there?  Fucking Samantha.  Yeah, but she's getting a lot of sex.  Oh, is she ever?  Speaking of Tiger Woods.  Tiger Woods.  I had Tiger.  Tiger and a cougar getting together.  Yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Let's go to Andy in Ohio.  Andy.  Yes.  Hey.  There's a website.  SarahJessicaParkerLooksLikeAHorse.com  Oh, really?  Can we check out that website real fast?  Oh, jeez.  SarahJessicaParkerLooksLikeAHorse.com  Very good.  We'll go there.  Uh, Maria, Jersey.  Hi.  I think Peter Griffin said it's a best friend family guy.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  She looks like a foot.  Yeah.  She looks like a foot.  Yeah.  Wow, that is bad.  I think that's perfect, don't you? 
[00:55:30]  Well...  They have pictures of SarahJessica Parker on the site,  and then right next to her picture,  they have pictures of horses,  and they're almost in the same pose.  It's a split screen.  Yeah, it's like a separated at birth kind of a thing they did  with SarahJessica Parker and the horses.  That's a pretty good job they did.  That's not good.  That's a good site.  We were on this years ago.  They have a picture of SarahJessica Parker  with her mouth open.  Of course, right next to her is a horse with its mouth open. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the site again, Dan?  SarahJessica Parker LooksLikeAHorse.com.  I think we talked about this before.  I don't remember.  A year ago.  A year and a half ago.  Yeah, right on.  It's worth mentioning every three or four months anyway.  Phil in Philly.  Phil.  Phil.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was just commenting that all the crazy shit that she's wearing,  I think SarahJessica Parker's trying out to be the new Batman villain.  That's about it. 
[00:56:30]  I'll punch it out.  What else?  We're hoping you're going to try to save yourself there.  Jimmy James.  Morning.  Great.  What's up, Jimmy James?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to point out with all her new fashion sense,  SarahJessica Parker has turned into an elderly blossom.  Oh.  Look at the wizardry on that.  We're looking at pictures where they're making her nose smaller.  They're fucking erasing all sorts of wrinkles and shit on her face. 
[00:57:00]  That's not a real picture.  That's a cartoon at this point.  It looks like one of those paintings from a picture.  She looks like a video game girl in that shot.  Uh, let's say hi to Shea in Georgia.  Shea.  Yeah, SarahJessica Parker looks like Jimmy Durante.  Uh, Jimmy Durante?  That's going back a bit.  Oh, God.  Iggy Popp.  Oh, they got one with Iggy Popp and SarahJessica Parker.  God damn.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, you know what? 
[00:57:30]  You know what?  That's not a bad idea.  Frank in Neptune.  Frank.  Hey, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  All right, Frank.  Hey, uh, Norton did a nice job on Leno last night,  and I think you guys should put the O&A spin on the text messages from Tiger  and have Big A do the Tiger part  and, uh, Stalker Patty do the various viewers.  Are you producing, Frank?  It's not a bad idea.  I'm not producing.  Yes.  But, uh, I was sitting there thinking about it. 
[00:58:00]  Well, our producer didn't think of anything to do with the text messages,  so why not?  Yeah, give it a shot.  I'll have to listen later.  I've got to go to class, unfortunately.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Nothing, uh, nothing more entertaining than, uh, Stalker Patty talking sexy,  like she does in that, um...  And suicide.  ...and suicide thing.  I, I've never truly cringed at a promo like, uh, like I do with that one.  Yeah.  It's painful to listen to Stalker Patty trying to sound sexy. 
[00:58:30]  Well, we should have had her come in today to do the text messages.  Yeah.  We could get, who could we get to read the text messages?  Because there's a whole bunch of them.  Just reading them suck.  Yeah.  Who, who do you guys want?  Sam plays a good girl.  Does he?  Uh, the, the virus.  Ha, ha, ha.  We have to, we have to, like, uh, cast this.  Who's gonna play Tiger for the text messages?  Hmm.  Um, who do you want? 
[00:59:00]  Um...  And then Jamie.  We need to cast Jamie as well.  Well, I always do like getting E-Rock involved.  So, who do you want E-Rock to play?  Um, Tiger.  E-Rock plays Tiger and Sam plays Jamie.  It's perfect.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  I have E-Rock playing.  Steve is Jamie.  I don't want Steve in here.  To be completely honest with you.  I don't want him in here.  Hey, hey.  Hey, he's fuming now down the hall.  Who cares? 
[00:59:30]  He should have figured this out.  We got text messages.  Figure out how we can make it better than every other radio station in America.  Everybody's just reading this shit today.  Patty would be nice.  I know, that would have been good, but that ain't happening.  So, we gotta, we gotta think on our feet here.  So, you want E-Rock?  E-Rock is Tiger?  Yeah, E-Rock is Tiger.  All right, then.  Who do you want as Jamie?  I don't care.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I guess, Sam.  What are we gonna do? 
[01:00:00]  There's not many people to choose from today.  We could steal Nicole from the morning mashup.  She could play Jamie.  Hmm.  What, Danny?  She'd just read it straight.  What?  I saw your look.  What?  Travis had suggested perhaps Fat Matt Ryan, our angry intern.  Fat Matt.  Fat Matt?  That's who?  Would he be angry doing it?  I guess.  I mean, that's his hook.  Who's he play?  Jamie?  I guess.  It's up to you guys.  Let's fucking give it a try.  All right.  I kind of like it. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Let's give him the stage today.  Where's E-Rock?  Eating.  Holy shit, what's going on here today?  No one's all like, is he running now?  Is he trying?  Sort of.  He ran for two steps.  Dude, he ran.  He did.  He did that.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Two-step little run.  I saw all the way down the hall him kind of start running out of the office, and then  he stopped two steps later.  And went to a complete walk.  That's almost impossible to do.  Unless you have no clue.  There he is. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, hi.  I won't say it in front of you.  Hi, E-Rock.  How are you?  You want to play Tiger today?  Okay.  And where's Fat Matt?  Or Angry Matt, or whatever?  Well, fuck.  Why don't you take your time?  Oh, my God.  Look at these guys.  What a lazy fucking bunch.  Someone call the biggest loser.  We could cast the entire new fucking season.  He's angry already.  Why are you angry?  I'm not angry.  Oh, wow.  You're going to play a chick today, all right? 
[01:01:30]  It's not the first time I've been called a woman, but...  Really?  On the phone, right?  Yeah.  Oh, so you got the woman's voice.  Because of your high voice.  Right here.  You got to get another New York Post.  Grab one from over there.  Start with the front page.  These are the text messages between Tiger Woods and Jamie Grubbs.  You're playing Jamie Grubbs.  Okay.  Now, we certainly don't want these read just like, you know, you're reading a textbook.  Right. 
[01:02:00]  We need, you need to emote as, you know, put some feeling in it like the people were feeling  when they were texting it.  You know how it is when you text things like, please pick a picture of your snatch and send  it to me.  You know, you're not just like, dear sir, please send a snatch picture.  Yeah.  You're like, yeah, you know, can you act?  I could try.  Well, that's the kind of get up and go we need here. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Hey, Rock, what are you doing?  Getting ready to read.  What are you doing with the headphones?  You've got to get ready to read.  The headphones fall apart.  I've got to get ready to read.  Let's get ready to read.  In this corner, Moby Dick.  He's used to just having a menu in front of him to read.  This is a newspaper.  There's nothing in there.  He's like, where are the prices?  There's nothing delicious in this reading you're about to do. 
[01:03:00]  No goodness.  No goodness whatsoever.  Unless you like cock.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  You're trying to fix that.  What are you doing?  We're live.  All you've got to do is put them on.  So ignore it.  The left earpiece fell off.  I'm putting it back on.  Just put it on.  Who cares?  Give it in these days of a new president.  We call it the presidential solution.  Right.  Just good enough to get you through it.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  What?  It's the presidential solution. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Here we go.  The text messages that are everywhere.  Jamie Grubbs and Tiger Woods.  Tiger starts.  Tiger played by Iraq.  Do you have a boyfriend?  I don't even have someone I'm dating.  No.  You could be my boyfriend.  Wink.  Then I am.  I wish.  Quiet and secretively, we will always be together.  That's you. 
[01:04:00]  When was the last time you got laid?  Jesus.  This is horrible.  I like the first thing that comes in is oof.  Just oof.  Oof.  Well, that's wonderful.  And this Jamie Grubbs thought she, you know, that Tiger was going to drop everything for  her.  Yeah.  Quiet and secretly means I'm going to fucking dump cum on you.  Quiet and secretly, you know, you'll be my chick.  Right. 
[01:04:30]  But, yeah, what does that mean?  That means nothing.  All right.  Let's continue.  July 20th at 3 o'clock.  3.04 p.m.  Actually, Tiger Woods.  Hey, sexy.  I can't come out this week.  Something came up family wise.  That's OK.  I hope everything is fine.  Would have liked to seen you.  We will make it happen.  Uh-huh.  Then we move on to July 26th, 1122 p.m.  I drove out for the night to surprise a friend with a present for their birthday. 
[01:05:00]  What kind of present?  Your naked body?  No, a watch.  I slept alone.  He's acting.  Give him a break.  All right.  Alone with him, that is.  Ha ha.  I wish.  Yuck.  Then we move on to September 27th, 6.38 p.m.  Miss you.  Now that's hot.  So who's your new boy toy?  No new boy toy. 
[01:05:30]  Still running dry.  Been on two real dates in the past two months.  Frowny face.  He's acting out.  Yes, he's acting out the emoticons.  I like that.  Nothing but respect for the acting out.  That's great.  Go ahead, Tiger.  I need you.  Loey beans.  Right.  What, Tiger?  I need you.  Mm-hmm.  Then get your tight ass over here and visit me.  I need you.  I will wear you out soon. 
[01:06:00]  How soon?  I got a new piercing.  Really?  Where?  I just sent you a pic of it.  It's on my cheek below my eye.  Implanted a little diamond.  Oh.  Send it again.  I didn't pick up on that.  You just need some attention from me.  Do you have a boyfriend?  I don't even have someone I'm dating.  No.  You could be my boyfriend.  Sm...  Winky face.  Winky face.  Than I am. 
[01:06:30]  I wish.  Quiet and secretively, we will always be together.  When was the last time you got laid?  And that's...  That one ended right there, so...  What do you think of that one, Ant?  Very sexy, especially with the womanly voice.  It's so hard to pay attention to what the texts are actually saying,  because I'm so distracted by the acting that's going on here.  Some good acting.  Uh, by the way, E-Rock has to step it up, as far as the acting goes. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, you said you wanted to kind of...  What?  What?  Like, Tiger's kind of...  No, I said not, uh, like a textbook.  Tiger's a bore.  I think E-Rock's playing it perfectly.  Is he?  Tiger's a fucking bore.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Alright.  And what I love about that last one,  she sent a picture of her face with this dumb diamond in it,  and Tiger saw it for two seconds and deleted it.  Like, yeah, whatever.  But then when she said piercing,  I guess he didn't notice that dumb diamond thing.  No.  So when she said piercing, 
[01:07:30]  he's like, send it again.  Because he thought maybe the piercing would be in a better place.  Yeah.  It's not.  But, yeah, he's just checking out pictures  and deleting the boring ones,  which, in this case, would be your face, Jamie Grubbs.  You know, the second you hit a picture  and it's not a nude body,  you're just like,  pfft,  Goodbye.  September 30th,  3.38pm.  It continues.  If we hang out on a Sunday,  we can watch Desperate Housewives again.  Oh, God.  Take a break from that boring old golf. 
[01:08:00]  His whole life is golf.  This fucking whore.  Take a break from that boring old thing  that got you a billion dollars.  You know, that stupid game.  Yeah.  That has made you one of the wealthiest sportsmen in the world.  Yeah, the only reason we're fucking.  Right.  You know that.  All right, back up.  Jamie again, take a break.  I mean the amazing sport of golf,  smiley face.  That's a winky face. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, winky face.  Oh, Jesus.  I apologize.  And then this is the best part.  So Jamie says,  Take a break from watching boring old golf.  I mean the amazing sport of golf,  winky face.  Bam.  And then more than an hour later,  so Tiger never commented  after she basically trashed what he does for a living.  Yeah, yeah.  Now he's a little pissed.  More than an hour later,  Jamie comes back with this text.  Babe, I was kidding.  I know, sexy. 
[01:09:00]  Shit.  Amazing.  October 1st, 6.06 p.m.  Jamie.  Is it Orange County time yet?  Oh, stop.  Smiley face.  I know, but you canceled on me last time,  so the anticipation is killing me.  I'm finding myself watching SportsCenter.  Ha ha, J.K., it isn't that bad.  It's never been that bad. 
[01:09:30]  Very true.  I only watch football.  Figured you would say that.  Big black guys.  Oh, shit.  It's fucking Tiger.  And she's starting to watch SportsCenter because of Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  That's just amazing to me.  What does J.K. mean?  I don't know.  J slash K.  Just kidding.  Oh, just kidding.  All right, right, right, right.  All right, continue.  You're my first, last, and only black guy.  You should feel special.  Why do I not believe that?  Ha ha ha ha. 
[01:10:00]  And then later, I'll read this part,  later in response to Jamie's mention of a date who was full of himself.  So she went out with some guy who was full of himself.  Tiger writes.  You kind of like that for some reason, which is weird why you decided on me.  Having an Asian mother and a military father,  you cannot and will not ever be full of yourself.  I have fun with you.  You always make me smile, and I'm not afraid to be myself or say anything to you. 
[01:10:30]  The day I met you, I thought you were going to kick me out a few times,  but for some reason, you didn't.  And you have told me numerous times I talk too much,  but slowly as I get to know you, you'll think I'm absolutely amazing.  Shut up.  You are wrong.  I'm Bone Thugs and Harmon.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Are you, Tiger?  Are you? 
[01:11:00]  All right, let me go to, any comments on that one, Ed?  No, that speaks for itself.  It's so obvious.  He's just trying to fucking get rid of some poison.  Yeah, yeah.  This is fucking.  This is a stupid fucking whore.  October 15th, 6.40 p.m.  Something wrong, babe?  I was excited to spend time with you this week.  I will you Sunday night.  It's the only night in which I'm totally free,  but I have to leave at 5.30 Monday morning  to drive up to the Valley for an outing for one of my sponsors. 
[01:11:30]  See you at 8 p.m. on Sunday in Newport.  Don't text me back till tomorrow morning.  I have too many people around me right now.  No, he has, no, no, no, no.  That means he has one person around him right now.  Yeah.  His wife.  The wife.  He casually makes it like, oh, there's a party going on.  A lot going on here.  Golf stuff.  Right, right.  Then we go to October 18th, 3.40 p.m. 
[01:12:00]  Send me something very naughty.  Some things are worth waiting for, lol.  Besides, I'm at work.  Oh, lol.  Go to the bathroom and take it.  Ha ha, you're too much.  No, really.  Go to the bathroom.  Like, he doesn't want to hear, ha ha, you're too much, lol, this, that.  It's like, go to the bathroom and take a picture of something.  Yeah, this isn't just.  Okay.  Next response should be, okay, and the picture. 
[01:12:30]  This dumb bitch, we're deep into these text messages, and she still thinks there's some  kind of, like, relationship thing going on.  No.  He wants to see your snatch.  Go and take the picture.  Give me the picture.  Right.  Where are we at?  October 18th, same day, eight hours later, 11.38 p.m.  Are you leaving me because your wife is still asleep in Newport?  Frowny face.  I am lonely now. 
[01:13:00]  I like falling asleep in your arms.  Okay, I read this one just to help it out a little bit.  She woke up to realize that Tiger was gone.  So I guess it looks like they spent some time together, and now that's why Jamie just wrote  that.  Did the old tiptoe the fuck out of there, huh?  And then Tiger.  Sorry, baby.  I just can't sleep.  It's just a problem that I have.  Apparently.  She's driving.  It's a dump and run, man.  A dump and run?  Oh, my God.  It's a dump and run. 
[01:13:30]  This Jamie should understand that.  She's been involved in a lot of dump and runs.  Come on.  Dump and run.  Wow.  Tiger.  Sorry, baby.  I just can't sleep.  It's just a problem I have.  Okay, and then Tiger continues.  She's not here.  They left this morning.  Well, I appreciate you not wanting to wake me up, but why I couldn't sleep?  I would rather have sat up and talked to you more.  Find out why I kept falling more and more for you, winky face.  Because I'm Blasian, smiley face. 
[01:14:00]  Blasian.  I'm sorry, babe.  I'm already home.  I'm putting my underwear back on.  That's a no-no.  Come take them off.  Ooh.  Smiley face.  You are too funny.  Yeah, and then we fast forward a good month, almost a month and a half.  It's November 26th, so what's that?  Was that the day before the crash? 
[01:14:30]  Day before?  Yeah.  Or the day of the crash, right?  Later on that night?  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  November 26th, 1116 a.m. in the morning there.  Yep.  Happy Thanksgiving to you.  You too, love.  And that was it.  That is the final text message that Tiger gave this Jamie Grubbs.  And then all hell broke loose.  Oh, yeah.  Damn.  Very good job, gentlemen.  Very good job. 
[01:15:00]  I think Angry Matt's job on that a little better than he rocks.  I'm sorry, you rock.  Nothing personal.  It's all right.  Angry Matt's reading got worse as the text messages continued.  I liked his emoticon reading.  I kind of liked that, too.  It was, you know, lol.  Uh, let's say hi to P.A. John.  P.A. John, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, it sounded like horrible book on tape from one of those stores that you get.  Oh, that was disgusting. 
[01:15:30]  A few people saying we should have had Kenny playing one of the parts.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That would have been good.  Yeah.  And, uh, let me go to Dana in Boston.  Dana?  Good morning.  What's up, Dana?  I, uh, had an observation that she's probably never sent a text to any of her, uh, standard  boyfriend saying, take a break from driving that boring old tow truck.  The best part of that whole thing was the fact that she made fun of his golf. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Which, which just shows you how, how much Tiger wanted to just fucking, you know, have sex.  Boring old golf.  Right.  I, I would imagine that really pissed him off.  Mm-hmm.  He's been playing that boring golf since he was a fetus.  And she's making fun of it.  Oh, my God.  Uh, number 12, uh, as far as Tiger, or number 13, uh, woman, uh, coming in now, uh, Lacey  Underalls. 
[01:16:30]  She, she saw her on the course.  Yeah.  Couldn't stay away.  Text with Lacey.  Come on over.  The judge will be away for the day.  Dr. Steve is gay.  It's official.  What?  Just want to say that.  Yep.  Wait, that's a, a bold statement.  He says it himself.  I turned on the radio and said, who's the chick with the sexy voice on O&A?  And found out it was ANGRYMAT.  Ah.  And that's all in caps.  Mm-hmm.  Now I'm gay.  Dr. Steve.  I, uh, I started following, uh, I have two new people I'm following. 
[01:17:00]  Um, and I'm, I'm ashamed to say I hadn't been following them earlier.  One is indeed Dr. Steve.  Mm-hmm.  I had not been following Dr. Steve on Twitter.  And I don't know why.  It was just an, I overlooked it.  And the other one, our own, uh, Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice Big Marma Frauds is a good follow.  And you know why?  That's a good follow, my friend.  I could never fucking remember his, his, his name when I went to just put it in.  But last night, I saw the Steven Seagal stuff, popped on, followed, and now I'm following Patrice. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, he, he, he does some good tweets.  Yes.  He's going to be in here in a few minutes, too.  I know, he's a good egg.  Uh, well, let's say hi to Highway in North Carolina.  Highway.  Yeah, boys, um, just wondering if you could have Fat Matt read a couple more things.  I'm almost finished.  I'm almost finished.  All right, we're going to go to break.  Uh, our pal Jim Norton was on Leno last night.  I want to check out, let's check out his set as we go to break here. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  All righty, you know, we have a lot of comedians on this show, and Jim Norton is one of them.  So, he must see this.  Uh, he's got his very own segment.  It's called Jim Norton, Uninvited Guest.  Jim Norton, Uninvited Guest.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  How are you?  Thank you.  It's nice to be back.  Uh, I'm slightly depressed. 
[01:18:30]  Um, I have a bit, thank you.  Uh, a bit of an anniversary.  April is going to be 20 years that, uh, I'm doing stand-up comedy.  And, um, I've had a lot of acting and commercial auditions in that time.  And I realized recently that in 20 years, I've never gotten a commercial.  Um, possibly because I'm not a particularly good actor.  Uh, my idea of expressing emotion is just opening my eyes really wide.  Not a good quality in a pitch man, I guess.  Colgate. 
[01:19:00]  And my managers are so stupid.  They sent me on an audition recently.  And I get there, and it was an audition for a magazine ad for Calvin Klein jeans.  Have you ever walked into a room and known, unequivocally, you're the ugliest person in the room?  It really was an odd moment.  I walked in, and we all looked at each other.  And we all knew that an error had been made. 
[01:19:30]  Now, that's not to say I've never done any modeling in my life.  That was a couple of years ago when I did the centerfold for Ugh! magazine.  Anyway, back to the audition.  Uh, I'm in this room, I'm 41 years old, and I'm surrounded by 19-year-old male Calvin Klein models.  Have you ever been in a room with guys so good-looking, it wouldn't be considered a homosexual act to sleep with them? 
[01:20:00]  All of my friends would have understood.  And it was humiliating, because the casting director takes Polaroids, and they go down the line.  And she gets to me, and she's like, smile!  And I'm like...  And then she's like, all right, let's see that profile.  And I'm like, ugh!  Because if you think that this view isn't award-winning, it doesn't get sexier and more marketable.  As I turn to the side. 
[01:20:30]  From the side, I look like a shell-less turtle.  So I'm standing there for a few seconds, and she goes, all right, thanks so much for coming.  And I'm like, lady, do you think I'm deaf?  You have a Polaroid camera.  You didn't take the picture.  It's like, couldn't you have just made the Polaroid noise with your mouth?  Thank you, I would have played along.  Because I think one reason I hate being photographed is I am a horrendous smiler. 
[01:21:00]  This photo shows exactly how I smile naturally.  For me, a smile has to be kind of unexpected.  It just kind of has to happen.  You know, like you're in the mall around the holidays, and you see a really old person fall down the escalator.  I think one of the problems is I tend to be intimidated by anything that's clothing or fashion-oriented.  My girlfriend took me shopping recently.  She wanted me to get a button-down shirt. 
[01:21:30]  And I have trouble buying shirts because no size fits me.  Because I'm kind of a weird body.  I'm like a medium slash extra large.  I have the torso and arms of a short man, yet the budding breasts of a teenage girl.  I have the kind of breasts where if I saw them on a woman, I'd go, ah, she's an athletic gal.  It's just depressing.  I hate my body.  If my torso had a sound, it would be, meh. 
[01:22:00]  Pants for me are also kind of a nightmare because I'm a 34-30, which is just despicable because I'm four inches wider than I am tall.  And here's what my body issues are.  I actually like the way I looked below the waist.  I have very good calves.  It's a little colder.  Normally when I perform, I wear knickers.  And I show them off by, you know, pivoting a lot. 
[01:22:30]  I have good thighs.  I have a nice ass, plump and kind of juicy is how it was described by an inmate.  I have average genitals, which on me could work either way.  It can either be a really nice surprise or a horrible disappointment, depending on in which order I get undressed.  Follow me because this is brilliant. 
[01:23:00]  Taking off my pants first, rookie mistake because it gets their hopes up.  Nice calves, nice thighs, nice ass.  Major disappointment.  When I take the shirt off first, expectations are lowered dramatically.  Thank you for applauding my lack of exercise.  They see me without a shirt. 
[01:23:30]  They're just happy.  It doesn't look like a twisted pig's tail.  Which is one reason that I like button-down shirts.  Because when revealing my body, I always find that when I wear a t-shirt, it's a bad move.  Because a lot of times I go, I take the shirt off, and as it's coming all over my head, I hear the front door slam.  But a button-down is good because I maintain eye contact. 
[01:24:00]  Which will shame a woman into staying.  Another sure way to make sure she stays, never pay up front.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you, buddy.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  And we've been just laughing for the last ten minutes just talking about the Perkins Waitress. 
[01:24:30]  I can't get enough of the Perkins Waitress.  I'm a mess.  And it's our goal now to get her on our show.  Who knows the Perkins Waitress?  We need to get her on this radio show today.  What a trooper.  Because no one's talking to her.  Nobody.  What a trooper.  No one gives a shit about her.  Everybody else is on The Insider, Extra, TMZ.  And that Perkins Waitress is still just going to work.  With her fucking Walmart glamour shot picture. 
[01:25:00]  Where just that old, you know, she used to be the, she was the first girl that Dracula bit.  And then he bit the younger ones, but she's still a vampire.  And he's just like, you know, you're living forever, bitch.  But he bit her when she was old.  Yeah.  And she just, she just, the poor lady.  She's the ultimate, like, the ultimate girl that you laugh at.  Like, you just. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's so sad.  Like, everyone else is seriously taken.  And you just immediately.  All these pictures.  Tell the truth in your gut.  You see all the pictures of all the girls.  You're like, shit, shit.  You see her.  You start laughing.  You just start laughing.  Can we get her picture up?  Let's see if we start laughing.  And look at her.  You guys got this thing on the front cover.  New York Post, Tigers, Green Feast.  By the way, I'm a cheater.  Yeah.  He got to be fair.  Yeah, that's fucking funny. 
[01:26:00]  It's just, it's pretty good.  Animal humor.  I didn't even get that fucking shit.  Tiger six.  Everything's the New York Post, the Inquirer.  She's on, she's in the magazine.  Like, she's on page three right after, right after Nostradamus.  Well, you got to explain.  She's the, the weekly world news.  The weekly world news.  Everyone else had, you know, kind of some of these, us magazine.  Oh, yeah.  All the big news.  All the big ones.  All the big trash magazines.  And the Perkins Waitress got an exclusive in the weekly world news or something. 
[01:26:30]  Right after.  Right after like a Yeti sighting.  It was news of the world.  Well, they might have killed two birds with one stone.  They had a Yeti sighting.  And her.  Right after Cloud, shaped like Abraham Lincoln's face.  Right after the picture of the Photoshop alien living in the swamps of fucking Alabama.  Devil's face seen in Hiroshima Explosion.  And her pussy.  That one.  And then poor her. 
[01:27:00]  It's so sad.  Poor woman.  I can't get enough of the Perkins Waitress.  News of the world.  That's what just.  Flash.  I like to know who the best one was.  And I would put money.  It was her.  The best one.  I think the best.  She had a try harder, right?  He did.  He probably just did some horrible things.  He probably did horrible things.  I told, I told, I think she goes home and has to like, you know.  When I say, I said, I'm trying to clean it up.  I said, all right.  I said that she goes home and shits out. 
[01:27:30]  I was trying not to go so harsh, but.  She calls truck drivers honey and sweetie.  All right.  I got that for you, honey.  They slap her on her ass.  Watch yourself, Freddy.  She just turns around and goes, hey.  Where the fucking tiger?  You don't laugh.  He went to Perkins Diner.  No, we.  After what?  Fucking U.S. Open?  One of the listeners figured it out.  It was the broad before his LASIK eye surgery.  Yeah, he couldn't really tell she was hot. 
[01:28:00]  He got his eyes done.  Dude, but where?  What was he doing?  Walking around touching things until he ended up in a diner?  And found her with a fucking half a pot of coffee and a grilled cheese sandwich?  She goes to pull her hair and a pencil falls out.  I'm just saying it.  She fucking slid.  She slid a milkshake down at the end of the table.  He's like.  It's a good joke is what I'm saying.  That's awful.  She's just thinking it as a real statement.  She fixes her hair. 
[01:28:30]  She's like tigers out there.  Oh, look at her.  She is trying to be sexy.  Oh, help me out.  She is frumpy.  I got an observation, but I need your cartoon knowledge.  Bugs Bunny.  The hair.  The monster.  The monster.  The monster, yeah.  What was the name of the monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon?  She's got the same hair.  Help me out, actually.  A sweetie push.  No.  It wasn't a sweetie push.  Gossamer was the monster.  But you never really heard his name. 
[01:29:00]  It was just monsters make such interesting people.  And he did his hair and put the dynamite in there.  And the little fucking doctor.  Yeah, the little fucking evil doctor and shit.  Yeah.  And he gave him ether and he fell asleep.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, her hair looks like the monster.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, that.  I think I'm starting to feel for this woman.  That's so sad.  And you know what?  She wasn't the best.  That whole fucking thing.  You need some type of sense of touch and physical fucking like hotness to get off like that. 
[01:29:30]  And you're sacrificing.  I don't care how good she sucks a dick.  If you're looking at that face.  Not true.  Let me tell you over the years I realized about both of you.  Yeah.  You're not true, true hunks of shit.  A true hunk of shit, that woman is a blessing.  That fucking blessing.  Basically, what you're saying is she doesn't mind having her head in the toilet as you're 
[01:30:00]  banging her from behind.  She has some things that she holds.  She holds a big teddy bear and just cries herself to sleep sometimes.  She has four cats.  She reads a lot.  Because she knows what she has done.  This is her big fucking chance, man.  Like, this woman, for a piece of shit guy, like a guy who just loves just to see.  Like, for real, you're looking at her?  I'm just going, why does she fucking look like naked, man?  All right, let me ask you this.  She's a catch for who? 
[01:30:30]  You know what I mean?  She's a catch for a trucker.  No.  No, she's not.  She's a super catch for a trucker.  I don't think she's that low.  She's a catch for a trucker.  She's a catch for a vice principal of a high school.  I knew he would come off with that.  Vice principal, dude.  Not even the principal.  That is new.  Patrice would have the answer.  That's vice principal's wife.  Vice principal.  That is a budding small-time entrepreneur. 
[01:31:00]  That is subway franchise owner's wife.  Subway franchise owner.  Dude, it's a struggling subway franchise owner.  If you're sending a sense of feedback, a little name so you get credit.  This guy writes, the waitress looks like a female country star from the 1970s.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  A Connie Francis. 
[01:31:30]  You could just picture her laying down.  That's a hot picture, dude.  That's a hotter picture than the ones where she's trying to be hot.  She's just fucking...  Come on, dude.  You come on, man.  There's nothing going on there.  No, Danny.  No.  No.  Danny's a hunk of shit.  Come on, Danny.  Look at that picture where she's just some normal broad.  Come on, man.  It depends.  No.  Exactly.  It would depend on the situation, I guess.  Look at that lady, man.  That situation would have to be pretty bad.  Here's a good observation.  Ted in Washington. 
[01:32:00]  Ted.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  The only reason why he heard that is because he knows that if she was the first one that  came out, no one would ever believe it.  He could deny it all day long.  Yeah, right?  You think I'd fuck back?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Like what Patrice was saying about her hugging the teddy bear and crying.  You think when she's just getting plowed in some horrible circumstance, like two fucking  truckers took her home and just put her on the rotisserie, she sits there and looks at 
[01:32:30]  her Perkins uniform with the Mindy name tag hanging up on the doorknob.  With syrup on the uniform that she just washed out.  And she's just looking and going like, what have I done with my life?  Now, what kind of diner is Perkins?  Is it like a...  I haven't been to one in years.  Is it an IHOP type of thing?  It's a good food.  It's a good, solid, quick, and easy diner food, kind of.  Right?  And she works there.  Pop up a Perkins.  Let's see what a Perkins looks like. 
[01:33:00]  Perkins restaurant and bakery.  Even their logo sucks.  Their logo is horrible.  Kindred Perkins from the Celtics comes up.  Let's see the outside of a Perkins.  And a plate of chicken.  All right.  You're talking...  It's on fire.  Oh, my good one, Dan.  It looks like a fucking...  That was probably done by Tiger.  Tiger, I was thinking of Saints.  Hoping she was trapped in there. 
[01:33:30]  One of those Viking funerals we were talking about.  Oh, it's just a fucking shithole.  I bet they got stupid fucking trinkets up on the walls and shit.  It would be the place to eat in, like, Des Moines, Iowa.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we go to Perkins tonight?  I don't think we have listeners in Des Moines, do we yet?  Who knows?  I want to talk to this lady.  I want to talk to her so bad.  And Tiger went there to eat.  The fuck was he thinking?  And people are just probably calling that poor woman...  She's probably getting the most whore out of all of them. 
[01:34:00]  She's getting a real whore...  Like, you know, people are using the word whore on her frivolously.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's unfair.  I bet you she's the nicest one.  I think I like her, man.  Better be.  I think I fucking like that old mess.  I want to see what she looks like naked.  If she has kids, she probably has that fucking rubber band stomach.  You're going to see all these girls naked.  C-section.  I guarantee you're going to see more than half of these broads naked in the next few months. 
[01:34:30]  A lot of bad corns on her feet from standing up at Perkins all day.  Big time bunions.  Like the bad cracked heels.  Big time bunions.  Dirty...  One knee is bad.  She has a bad knee.  She's getting old.  Bad knee.  She creaks a lot.  Her belly button looks like an asshole.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Just wrinkled up.  Her fucking nipples are pointing straight down.  Straight down.  They're strep udders.  Danny and flutters. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Just old before her time, basically.  She tries so hard to keep her hands behind her head in bed, like all night long, just  to stretch them up a little bit.  Kegel exercise.  Doesn't help.  Fucking BJ's.  A case of alum from BJ's.  Just sits in that all day.  Tighten up that cooch.  You think during sex she's always reaching to her right to put the boob back up on her  chest?  Yeah.  Just a mess. 
[01:35:30]  Danny, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, man.  This Perkins is actually within walking distance of Isleworth.  And he goes there all the time.  And the people that live in that area, they leave him alone when he's in there.  And, you know, he goes and sits with the same waitress all the time.  So it's not like, unfortunately, as much as we all like to think it's a truck stop, you  know, type of place, it's not.  It's in this ritzy area. 
[01:36:00]  And you wouldn't think a Perkins would be there.  But sure enough, it's there.  And that's where he met her.  And he's been going there ever since he moved there.  Wow.  So, you know, it's just, it's a little different.  I think the other color was right.  I think I like Tiger now.  I never wanted to hang out with him, man.  Let's look at a Perkins menu.  Because maybe I got the wrong restaurant.  Someone else is saying it's like a Denny's.  Yeah, Perkins Denny's.  It looks like a TGI Friday is only smaller or some shit.  Maybe I'm thinking of the wrong restaurant. 
[01:36:30]  I thought I ate at Perkins when I was living in Buffalo and had no money.  After the bar is closed.  Yeah, we'll pull up the fucking menu.  Oh, Jesus.  There we go.  Look at these bad fucking, look at this bad, full, bountiful Benedicts.  I love that.  They give you a tiny plate of fruit to make it look like you're eating something healthy.  Celebrate the holidays with Perkins Bake Shop.  Or new honey ham.  Yeah, it's a lot of fried, a lot of cheese, a lot of fucking processed food. 
[01:37:00]  Onion rings.  It's your hot cakes.  Oh, they make your pancakes to look like, uh, like, like...  Oh, good.  Your kids' pancakes are a fucking copyright infringement from Disney.  They look like Mickey.  Order your holiday feast online through Perkins.  All right.  Really?  Let's do that.  Really?  Give me some Perkins.  Can we call the Perkins that you used to work at?  Oh, really?  What happened?  They weren't happy with us? 
[01:37:30]  Uh, we were angrily hung up on.  Oh, really?  Can we call them one more time?  Can I just...  Can I just ask?  We're at old Tiger Woods, bitch.  I want to meet her.  Let me just ask...  Let me just get on the phone and just say that.  I want to meet her.  She is fucking...  Let me just...  Can we call them?  Can we call them?  They never agree to be on the air.  Yeah, we'll give her...  We'll give another try, but Mitch has a great one.  Mitch in White Plains.  Go ahead.  Hey, uh, yeah.  Dean at Perkins.  I go out to the Poconos. 
[01:38:00]  It's basically, uh, a friendlies with tablecloths.  It's an on-scale friendlies?  Yeah, you get a fribble.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Uh, let's go to Juan in Indiana.  Juan?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Perkins is known for their, uh, muffins, man.  They serve them up nice and, like, warm and shit, and they put butter on it.  They're badass when you're drunk.  As opposed to what place that doesn't have hot muffins with butter, you fucking low-life  cocksucker? 
[01:38:30]  Hey, why are you going after the guy?  I'm just mad that he would say that shit.  He just enjoys a good Perkins muffin.  They're known for fucking baking their muffins.  As opposed to what?  Just the batter?  You motherfucker with no butter?  They're known for their crispy bacon.  You don't go anywhere, and they don't get butter and hot muffins, you cocksucker!  Anywhere you go.  They got that.  He was offended because he goes to Perkins every night.  They're known for that.  They're known for what?  Hold on.  Someone's very upset with us.  Trucker Bill in Georgia. 
[01:39:00]  Trucker Bill.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, you're making fun of her like she's just a common waitress.  She's a manager.  You know the managers have to wait tables, too.  Perkins.  Yeah, right on.  And we go to Rich in Georgia.  Rich.  Hey, guys.  Y'all are forgetting.  I guarantee you, like y'all's buddy Evan says, she definitely licks the crack.  She licks the crack, right?  Yeah.  She'd have to dig in there.  She's done some dirty stuff, right?  She's done it, but she doesn't do it unless you approach it as if it's a surprise. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  If you do anything expected of what she knows she looks like, she'll turn on you like a  fucking...  And you have to kiss her.  You got to think it's only going to be like...  You got to present it like it's only going to be a lady coming into this room to have a  nice sexual encounter.  If you go in there thinking, all right, I'm going to put your head in the toilet.  I'm going to fucking fuck you in the asshole.  Listen, let me tell you something. 
[01:40:00]  Here's how you get her on her good side.  Have Perel.  You put some Perel on your hands and you go, excuse me, I just have to freshen up.  If you say fret, but if you just pull one...  If you pull your dick and balls through the fucking...  The shoe to your boxes.  If you leave any clothes on at all.  Socks, shoes.  If you fuck her with some socks and Timberlands on through your dick hole or your shorts, she's 
[01:40:30]  not having it.  Because that's what you expect out of her.  And you have to expect that she stays all night.  Oh, you can't kick her out.  No fucking way do you kick her out of the house.  She, um...  Is that Perkins?  No, that's Tiger's Mansion, right?  No, that looks like...  That's a...  That's the...  The Perkins is somewhere around here.  I think it's like in like a...  Yeah, that doesn't look like a Perkins.  You think Tiger picked his broads depending on how well he was doing? 
[01:41:00]  No.  What do you mean?  Like he misses the cut, so then he goes after the Perkins waitress.  That's interesting, Tate.  Like a little self-fucking...  That's a little...  I don't deserve a real abuse.  I mean, don't you jerk off to porn depending on how you feel?  Like when I'm feeling really, really good, I jerk off to really, really beautiful women.  Yeah.  When I'm not feeling like I'm at the top notch, I jerk off to lesser.  To garbage.  And it becomes more and more just hoary.  I've never noticed that.  Like I've never noticed any difference in what I... 
[01:41:30]  You never like...  Well, you go...  Like sometimes if it's just beautiful, like beautiful, like, you know, 22-year-old porn  doing their thing, you go, you go, I don't feel like I'm relating to this.  Like I like to jerk off the porn that I relate to at the time.  But that's always for me.  I'll never look at something like fucking, you know, one of these plastic bubble-titted  fucking penthouse looking shit. 
[01:42:00]  You know, it's always got to be a real girl, you know.  Right, to make you feel, you know what I mean?  So, I mean, I think like the...  Opie, I think that's a fucking interesting question, man.  I mean, he...  Because for him, for Tiger to fuck her, like if he's with a mentality to it, I think he's  just a hunk of shit.  I think he's...  I like him, man.  I just think he's a fucking...  He's garbage.  And I say that with all due respect.  Yeah.  Like that motherfucker loves pussy, man. 
[01:42:30]  But if he's winning the British Open or the U.S. Open, he treats himself to some fine  ass.  He ain't no homo.  That's what...  Like some motherfuckers are trying to prove a point.  Yeah.  That motherfucker ain't no homo, man.  He's fucks.  That guy loves pussy, man.  He certainly seems to.  That's for sure.  And he had two kids quick with his wife.  He loves nothing in them.  He has no discretion with that giant dick.  He don't give a fuck, man.  The latest, that Rachel Broad, she's getting tested for STDs because now she's pissed off 
[01:43:00]  that Tiger...  Fucked all the other chicks.  Fucked all the other chicks with no bag and now that there's two porn stars in the mix,  she's like...  What the fuck did she think?  Oh my God.  But then again, they're all trying to keep their attention going.  So that's the latest.  That's how Rachel got attention today.  She said she's getting some fucking testing done today.  If she comes up with a fucking...  Oh man, if one of these bitches comes up with a bad one...  They're starting to talk possibly Love Child out there.  Chlamydia.  You know what?  Love Child. 
[01:43:30]  Playgirl's saying, look, they got pictures they think is Tiger's wang.  So that might come out.  What you said yesterday...  Which one?  I rethought it.  Is the O.J. Simpson thing?  This is as big for what it is as O.J.  For what it is.  Yes.  Let me think.  It is because from where he was to where he is...  He didn't just get caught cheating and it's just this one love triangle thing. 
[01:44:00]  Like a letterman or whatever.  We've seen a lot of these stories come out.  Bought her a ring.  One and done type of thing.  This is a hole involved...  He's a maniac.  And the only way he can get out of this is just to say, I love...  And not even say, this is...  And let me tell you this angle that is making me sick.  Dude, I think the public is savvy too.  He can't just go on an Oprah and go, I have a problem.  I have a problem.  Because I think the public is way too savvy and they're going to be like, you're fucking 
[01:44:30]  saying this shit to try to get your image back.  Bullshit.  You're a piece of shit.  Stop.  Bullshit.  Stop with the fucking, I'm an addict.  Nigga.  Yeah, that ain't going to work.  I can't stop breathing air.  I need help.  He loves fucking.  He needs to just come out and go, look, man, I don't really have an apology.  The only thing I'm sorry is if I got caught.  I didn't want to hurt my wife.  But man, I love fucking, dude.  I'm Tiger Woods.  Wouldn't you fuck?  If you was just...  If you was Fred Woods. 
[01:45:00]  Fred Woods, the mechanic.  That knew me.  I know niggas.  Look, I know motherfuckers that get pussy.  Because they know me.  If I shake your motherfucking hand, I'm Tiger Woods.  And I'm walking up the street.  And a motherfucker, right, is down in...  Tiger's in the village.  Yeah.  Right?  Downtown.  And I'm in the village and I go, what's up, T?  He go, Patrice, man.  Well, how you doing, motherfucker?  Give me a big handshake, get in his limo.  Drive off.  I get pussy. 
[01:45:30]  Tiger is...  He can get you success by just saying, what's up, motherfucker?  Yeah.  How can you fight that shit, man?  You don't expect that he gets pussy and loves it, and he has a big-ass dick to boot?  Yeah, yeah.  The OJ for what it is thing.  We exist for pussy.  We exist for pussy.  When I'm...  The only time...  I'm telling you, I like staying busy so I don't think about pussy.  It's like, when I have to get gas in my truck, from the time I go, ooh, I need gas, to the 
[01:46:00]  time I go, get gas, I go, that's time.  I don't have to think about pussy.  It's always on your mind.  It's downtime in between pussy.  Yes!  That's all we're here for!  And...  Mm-hmm.  Why do you got a nice truck?  And a nice house for you?  No!  I guess not.  No, no.  You can live in a fucking...  You can live in a one-bedroom nice house.  Now, let's think of why you do things like that.  Yeah, but when I was...  Part of it is... 
[01:46:30]  When I was living with, like, a college kid with no money, I did just fine, so...  Yep.  Just fine.  No, I mean...  For pussy, but you loved...  You made your bed up.  Hell fucking no, I didn't.  You washed your dishes?  No, I didn't.  You had your own place?  Yeah.  Good enough for college.  Fuck it.  Well, I mean, no, in college, you always have roommates.  No, I didn't have my own place.  But you had a place you could take the bids?  Yes!  Okay, and the standards...  I had fucking dishes that grew shit on them.  But the standard is different, though. 
[01:47:00]  College girls are different from grown-ass women.  When, as a man, as a renaissance man, you have a pool.  For you, that's great.  Yeah.  But that pool, for real?  For just you?  No.  Patrice, I have to disagree a little bit.  I didn't have to buy shit to get pussy.  No, I'm not saying...  And I didn't have to have nice things.  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying you have to.  Right.  I'm saying men do these things for the flash and the peacocks thing. 
[01:47:30]  Why not drive...  The animalistic thing?  Why not drive a shitty car...  I did for many years.  But you didn't, when you didn't have to.  Right.  Because I fucking wanted a car that had heat.  Will you fucking stop, motherfucker?  No, I'm...  Will you fucking stop this bullshit?  I'm not stopping this shit.  There is another side to this.  You wanted a car with heat?  A Prius has shitty fucking car.  Drive a Prius.  I had no fucking money.  Drive a Charger.  You would never do that. 
[01:48:00]  I wasn't...  I wasn't...  Orton drives a nice BMW.  You think, because it has heat?  Why would you say that shit?  Huh?  Why would you say that?  I'm being honest.  It's all...  I never thought that I need to buy all sorts of nice shit to get pussy.  I'm being completely honest with you, Patricia.  Wait a minute.  You're not with me on the fact that you need to do those things to get pussy.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying what we do is...  We're inclined to do certain things for pussy. 
[01:48:30]  Not to get it, but just that pussy likes us.  To make you more attractive than the other guy that doesn't have that shit.  In general.  Right.  I just didn't live that way.  For real.  I'm sorry that I don't agree with you on this one.  You do.  You're just fucking being difficult.  No, I'm not.  You're being difficult.  To say that, hey man, I wanted a nice car for you.  It's an instinct.  I didn't...  Well, then...  It's an instinct.  I can't argue if it's an instinct.  Yes.  But that's not what I was thinking when I'm walking around looking for a car. 
[01:49:00]  Let me ask you this.  First of all, the car thing sucks too because I just was never a car guy.  Do you think being you helped in the past?  What do you mean?  You think being Opie helped in the woman department?  I was...  You would have got pussy as Gregory.  But don't you think Opie helps?  I've been to Opie since I was 12 years old.  But I was doing fine for myself before I had any type of thing.  I mean, Opie, the fucking radio guy.  I'm not saying you couldn't have got pussy because of that.  But don't you think being Opie... 
[01:49:30]  Dude, I swear to you, not much of a difference.  And that is my God honest answer.  I wish I had some hot coffees I could just throw out.  I'm telling you the God's honest truth.  I'm not saying you needed to be that for...  I'm saying being...  Did it help?  Being what you are, some of it.  Not noticeably.  None of anything has to do with girls.  Ever.  None of it.  Right.  None of the radio, no cars, no nice houses, no nice shoes, no nice haircuts, had anything 
[01:50:00]  to do with a bitch.  I still don't have nice...  Look at my shitty shoes.  Because you're a fucking millionaire guy who...  It's cool to be...  White guys think it's cool to act bummy.  Oh my God.  Bummy, bummy.  But this is just me.  I didn't see it the same way that I did before I got money.  I don't know.  I'm being honest with you.  I'm trying to think of what I wish my superpower was right now. 
[01:50:30]  No, Patrice, stop him.  Patrice, I lived in a shitty...  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I lived in a shitty apartment until two years ago.  I was making a lot of money and I was still living among mice and cockroaches.  It was stupid on my part, but I didn't give it a thought.  I liked where I live.  I liked the location.  I just stayed there.  We are...  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Absolutely.  I'm not saying it right because I'm not saying you're doing it for...  There's things you do...  No. 
[01:51:00]  You eat at nice restaurants.  It just makes you a better man.  And it's basic human nature to want to be or have, if you can, things that are a little  better than somebody that doesn't have the means to just for comfort, for this or for pussy.  It's in there, too.  But it's like...  Like, okay, why did you get a place where you have, where you live, and not just some fucking... 
[01:51:30]  Why didn't you stay in your apartment?  Or get an apartment that didn't have rats and shit?  I realized there was time to fucking grow up, finally.  Well...  And the place was falling apart with flugs and mice and cockroaches.  I really...  Why not get a place that was a lot cheaper than where you're living?  I could have gotten a place that's a lot more expensive, too.  I don't know.  I didn't...  I looked at places, and this is the one I liked.  I liked the fucking view.  That's it.  I bought the stupid place for the view.  Because you know what?  Ultimately...  Dude, I had a view mean something as a guy. 
[01:52:00]  I only bought a brand new car last February.  Because there's a lot of people saying I'm full of shit.  I had the same car for seven years, and my wife, she was my wife at the time, is sitting  in a seat where she doesn't get her own fucking heat.  Here's what you're missing.  And then finally, after the fourth flat tire in a month, I'm like, you know what?  I think I gotta get a new car.  You're missing the context.  That's what's going on.  The context, we're missing something.  But I...  Because you're defending...  There's a link here.  Yes, there's something missing. 
[01:52:30]  Because you're saying something that I don't...  That doesn't matter.  I'm just proud that I was able to do fine for myself without all that money shit.  That's all I'm saying.  But fuck the before the shit money shit.  Like, we all had to work a little harder for whatever we got, especially as far as,  you know, girls go.  Back then, we just did.  You know something?  Ask me...  And some people are saying, ask Anthony that question.  Sure, I had to work a little harder as a tin knocker than I did as Anthony the radio guy. 
[01:53:00]  When I walked into your house, here's what dudes think.  Walking into your house, walking into Ovi's...  I've never been to Ovi's house.  Day I go there, walk into this house, here's the thing you think of as a dude.  You go...  And I got a decent house.  You walk in, you go, god damn, boy.  Duh, duh.  Even if you're married and kids, you go to pussy in this motherfucker. 
[01:53:30]  You just picture some 25-year-old goofball coming in going, oh!  And you go, right, you like that?  You like that status, baby girl?  You like it?  Look at that.  Go up them stairs.  Hey, matter of fact...  Go up them stairs.  Hey, fuck it.  Hey, check this out.  Check out the heat of the floor.  Check this out.  Let me tell you...  Go up them stairs.  My girl, me and my girl came...  My girl came a long way, period.  But she came a long...  We've come a long way together.  When I bought my new place, you know what she almost cried about?  I took...  My sink came on, and it was one of those fucking faucets that pull off and... 
[01:54:00]  To rinse the dishes.  To rinse the dishes.  She goes, does it pull...  Oh, my God.  Like, she just...  You just...  You go, that's right, bitch.  I got me to pull that motherfucker...  And water comes out the refrigerator, bitch.  Like, you just...  Bitches love that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's not for the...  No, no, no.  It's like, you know...  We're missing the context, man.  Yeah, because I could say the same thing. 
[01:54:30]  I didn't go looking for a house to go, where is my bitch magnet house?  Yes.  But when you have the house and have this and that, it's like, it would make it a lot  easier, you know, to go, why don't you come on over and stuff and hang out, and then you're  hanging out in that house and not in my shitty fucking apartment.  And you do it for guys, too, because when you got guys that come over, people you respect  that, they shake your hand and go, man, this is a beautiful house. 
[01:55:00]  There's a pride thing.  There's a pride, it's an everything thing.  And it's a very primal, old, male thing, you know, that goes way back, way back to  I have better cave paintings on my walls than you do, motherfucker.  And you're just looking around, and I'm like, but you just go, dude, I have to say, this  is a beautiful...  When I told you, when I came to your crib, I'm just going, this is what an asshole, you  know, you get like this, because this dude, how come you didn't put...  Like I said, how come you didn't put...  I go, why would I fucking say, why didn't you put crown molding? 
[01:55:30]  And I'm like, there is crown molding up there, Patrice.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  But that's my way of going, Patrice, inferior, insecure Patrice.  Oh, good, a crack on his wall.  Why would I fucking do that?  Because it's just so good a crack.  Good.  God, goddamn.  Anthony had a roach.  Good.  Oh, God.  Well, you got the phones lit.  We'll start from the top and go to the bottom, I guess. 
[01:56:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Boston.  Mikey.  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, boys, here's the problem, right?  Uh, Patrice, what you don't understand, Gregory, he's a beautiful man.  Well, thank you.  He doesn't have to work that hard.  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you.  You know, that's how it is.  I don't know.  I'm not.  No homo.  No homo.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian.  Brian. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Oh, I think it goes back to your childhood, and I can relate to this, because my mom used  to bring home no frills food from the supermarket, and I almost feel guilty, like, having stuff  that was better than my parents were able to give me, even though I know I can afford it.  I have a lot of guilt as far as the amount of money I make now, just because of where  I came from, and I'm not doing a, trust me, I'm not.  But it explains myself a little better, and this is, I think, where Ant and I can completely  agree with.  When I was growing up, I lived in Centerport, Long Island, which is kind of an almost upper 
[01:57:00]  middle class neighborhood, and I was going to school with kids that always had the latest  shit, the latest haircuts, the fucking brand new cars when they turned 16, 17, whatever  the driving age was back then, and so you figured a way around that to compete with these  guys to get the girls.  I totally relate to that.  You know, it's like, you can only bring your lunch to school so many times with a concrete  bag before you realize you need something a little bit better.  Dude, I mean, my parents, until I started making my own money, I mean, one pair of sneakers 
[01:57:30]  a year, one fucking haircut a year, I had a lot of white boxes in my house, because it  was all the no-frill shit, and then you go to school, and someone's driving in a brand  new Beamer, you know, because he turned 16 or 17 years old.  It was hard to compete against that, so you had to figure out all this shit.  I grew up in Wanto, I can totally relate to that.  Let me, maybe this analogy helps.  I'm trying to figure out how I can just, I hear what you're saying, I just don't agree 
[01:58:00]  with it.  I, I, oh, okay.  I only bought, bought a brand new car, it's not even a year old, I had my last car for  seven years.  You don't need, look at, you're a good looking dude.  So I wasn't thinking like, oh, I better get a car to keep my status up and keep my, you  know.  You're a good looking dude, you don't, no, matter of fact, here's what I learned over  the years, women ain't us.  So, for real, like I said, I've said many times, if I was my girlfriend, I, I, if, wouldn't 
[01:58:30]  give me pussy if I was her.  Right.  But I'm thinking as a dude.  What I'm saying is when, as, as a, as a man, like what fame is for a man.  So you don't feel like you can get pussy unless you had like some good shit around?  So that's insecurity.  No.  You didn't, you weren't getting pussy when you had nothing.  Absolutely.  What kind of pussy?  Ugly pussy?  Good pussy.  Once I realized as a guy.  Right. 
[01:59:00]  That women like you for other reasons, because insecurity, yes, physically, I'm not fucking  that guy.  Right.  You know, but once I realized that you, you, you can talk your way in the pussy, that's  when pussy problems stop for me.  Right.  What, what I'm saying is as a man, okay, stuff is our pussy.  Money is our pussy.  Meaning we're not going to feel like what it has. 
[01:59:30]  I think you found the missing link.  To have pussy like, being a, being a celebrity, right?  And I'm not saying me, I'm saying you like Jamie Foxx or somebody like that.  That's right.  His fame just keeps him even with a strange pussy.  Hey, look at the confidence these bitches have with Tiger Woods because they have a pussy.  Tiger is a fucking corporation.  He's like GMC.  Mm-hmm.  But only being that gives him the same level as them. 
[02:00:00]  It keeps them even.  Right.  That's why he's getting these hot, hot girls.  Because Tiger's a good looking dude.  But he ain't, he ain't fucking a stunning looking motherfucker.  No homo.  He's a, for a black and Asian mix, not an exotically stunning guy.  Goofy eyes.  Going bald.  Kind of fucking whatever.  He's got a weird balding pattern going on.  That's just a weird looking little kid.  I noticed that.  But he's a motherfucker on, in life.  So status and money, that's just.  All right, we got it.  Let's go to Cody in Indiana. 
[02:00:30]  Cody.  What's up, dude?  Hey.  I've got proof that you guys, we as men buy shit for pussy.  Anthony, am I right?  You had a fur coat when you were a kid.  You asshole.  My mother bought me that and I didn't want to wear it.  Because Joe Namath wears it.  Joe Namath has one just like this.  Yeah, Joe Namath is the quarterback of the Jets.  And I'm a fucking kid that's going to get my ass handed to me if I go to a school in a fur coat, mom.  You dummy. 
[02:01:00]  You didn't get it.  Holy shit.  How do you think Letterman's getting 21-year-old twat?  He's 9 million years old, man.  Perfect.  Perfect example.  Yeah.  And he probably could without it.  Yeah.  He could be the Doskagi's beer guy and fucking just talk.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  But he's just, you know.  All right.  I'm not saying you need these things to get pussy.  But if women were like men?  You would.  Yeah.  You would.  But they're not like us. 
[02:01:30]  You've taught us that.  All right.  Want to take a break?  I mean, the phones are lit.  They're all making the same point.  I mean, you want to keep going?  Yeah, they really are.  They want to yap about this.  Let's go to Jeff in Rochester.  Jeff.  Yeah.  Hey, Patricia.  As much as I think you're funny, you got this all fucked up.  My wife bought the house.  I don't pay for shit.  And I love it.  And she's fucking horny.  Well, that's not a...  I never said that that's a bad thing. 
[02:02:00]  What's the...  Where am I, like, disagreeing with you?  That's a...  That's fair.  Where the guy has to buy you by the guy.  Fuck that.  I don't buy enough.  And she even buys my beer for him.  Well, that...  Well, I'll tell you what, though.  At the end of the day, my friend, you in a bad spot.  Don't ever forget that.  Don't be that proud to be a kept man.  Because I'm going to tell you...  This is the trickle down.  Listen, listen, listen, listen to this.  I'm going to try to help you out here.  What you're saying is that you have a queen, okay?  But you're not a king. 
[02:02:30]  You're just the queen's husband.  You're not the top...  You're not...  Wait a minute.  You're not as high as you could be for yourself.  Never forget that.  And when shit hits the fan, she's going to hold every single thing, even that fucking  Miller Lite she bought you, over your head.  And you're going to be stuck.  I'm just saying.  Be careful.  Later.  All right.  Wow, this guy's getting it wrong.  I mean, Ant, actually...  Well, let this guy say what he wants.  Will in Maryland.  What's up, Will? 
[02:03:00]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to call in and call some bullshit on Ant.  Look, man.  I didn't know you didn't go out to Long Island and purchase that enormous daycare center  and are not thinking you weren't going to get any pussy.  You asshole.  Nah.  You know what?  I actually...  I understand, by the way, there are women out there that will, you know, fuck you because  you have money and fame.  I'm not stupid.  I understand that, Patrice.  First and foremost...  I do understand that.  Well, this is going to take months for us to talk on the phone off air. 
[02:03:30]  For me, I'm not making myself clear.  Okay, here it is.  I'm just not.  Here it is.  First and foremost, I got my house pretty much for, like, wow, look what I'm able to  get now.  But then there's the perks of having that.  Secondly, about being, you know, Opie and Anthony being out if that helped or helps or whatever.  When we were doing bar gigs and we had an inn to talk to those fucking Kahlua girls and 
[02:04:00]  the Budweiser girls and shit because they're doing a gig too.  Now I'm not Joe Schmo at the bar having to compete with fucking every other guy for these  girls' attention.  I'm the guy with the mic.  I can walk up to these girls and go, hey, man, you want to do a shot?  You want to do it?  Without feeling like the awkward, I got to walk up there, guys.  So it did help.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I agree with that point.  It helped getting into a certain situation. 
[02:04:30]  Makes it easier.  But when you weren't Anthony from Opie and Anthony, you did well too because you adapted.  Right, right.  But not even talking about that.  You adapt to what you have.  That doesn't matter.  Let's say we're talking about...  We're not far off here.  I get it to a point.  We're talking about the Renaissance period and you're talking about prehistoric times.  Fuck prehistoric times.  We understand.  We were all able, due to our fucked up minds and bad fucking complexion and whatever crosses  we had to bear had to step up more in order to get girls. 
[02:05:00]  But once we crossed over that little line and got some radio fame up in Massachusetts, you  know, shit like that, it was easier to go into a bar as Anthony from the Opie and Anthony  show than it would have been to just walk into a bar as Anthony Tinnocker.  And can I piggyback on this and say, that's what fame is for for a guy.  It's self-motivating.  But what it does is the thing that makes women have a... 
[02:05:30]  On the meeting is that when you say hello to a bitch as a strange man in the street,  she's like, ugh.  Ugh, what is this creep doing?  But if I come in and she knows me, and all that does, it doesn't help me fuck her.  She goes, oh, I know he's a creep.  But I know him.  It just keeps me from having to fucking do the next...  Now she can just listen to me.  That's all it is.  It's just to make her listen to me. 
[02:06:00]  And once she listens to you, look, you could be famous all day long and you say some shit  like, ugh, I like you.  Like, did...  Yeah, you feel it.  Did fucking Clark Gable just go, oh, who?  Like, if Clark's like, hey, honey, how are you doing?  And she's like, oh, my God.  Then it's like, wow.  But I'm just...  I'm missing something.  I think you understand what I'm saying.  I got you.  I know, I know.  I just can't figure it out.  I can't figure it out.  Let me say hi to Drew in Nashville.  Drew. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, more of us.  I just wanted to quote Dave Chappelle.  I think he sums it up perfectly when he says, if a man could fuck a woman in a cardboard box,  he wouldn't buy a house.  See?  He knows.  Wow.  I mean, you want to keep going or what?  And you know the sad thing and why this is so fucked up, this whole tiger thing and all  it is because this conversation right here, women don't do this kind of thinking because 
[02:07:00]  they got a pussy.  They don't think, like, they don't have these talks.  These talks are important for men because we're behind in pussy.  It don't matter.  It just...  We got to make it up in other ways.  We think a lot about pussy.  Look at this shit.  This is all about pussy.  Whether buying a house is getting it or not.  That's thinking about pussy.  The term Patrice is thinking of is called peacocking.  I get all that.  Peacocking.  I get all that. 
[02:07:30]  Do you get a quality broad because of your money, though?  Yeah.  Or do you get shallow broads?  You get...  I think you make your broad what it is.  You can find a shallow broad and then she can still love you because she's a broad.  I don't want to start with a shallow broad and make her into something either.  And make her deep?  You want to start with a deep broad?  I don't know if there's any deep ones.  There's a difference, too, between if you're looking for a fucking girlfriend in a relationship  or you're looking for a fucking...  Right.  Of course.  That's a huge difference.  Of course.  Oh, my...  Hey, I got a text. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, okay.  Quote from 50 Cent.  He's selling all his jewelry.  50 Cent said, I don't need jewelry anymore because my face is my jewelry now.  Damn, that's a good quote.  That's it.  That's a good quote.  That's from my girl.  She's a fucking...  She's...  You know...  Wow, that's some fucking quote.  He just said, I don't need this shine.  I don't need things...  Look at me.  I don't need it.  I am the shine.  It's like, look, it's fitty.  It's fitty.  It's very real. 
[02:08:30]  Let's go to Anthony on Long Island.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Obi, if you look at it this way, it's not what you have or what you look like.  But the mere fact of who you are as a celebrity is going to help you get the pussy.  You know, even as these broke celebrities now, they probably can still get pussy because  of who they are and not what they have.  Yeah, shallow broads.  Who cares?  Pussy, pussy.  No, I get that part of it.  If you're just going for pussy because pussy's pussy, I get that. 
[02:09:00]  But if you're looking for something a little deeper or more meaningful, you know, it's  not going to be with a shallow broad.  But you're being presumptuous.  I had my share of shallow broads.  But what makes a shallow broad?  Because she wants money?  You want pussy.  It's the same shit.  Let me explain something.  Let me explain something.  The difference to a guy, girl, in terms of this.  If men, and this is the thing of men understanding, we don't have anything that makes us walk down  the street, except for money, that if a woman goes, hi, Greg, or hi, Anthony, where you 
[02:09:30]  go, that bitch, all she wants is this.  Same thing with women.  When a guy goes, hi, miss, she's like, oh, my God, he's trying to fuck me.  Now, here's the difference with what I think a guy would do and a woman would do if we had,  let's say, God said every day we got $10,000 in our pocket.  Every day.  It's just, we'll never be without $10,000.  Like girls have a pussy.  Yes.  We have $10,000.  Here's the difference. 
[02:10:00]  Okay.  A woman goes, hi, you might as a man be thinking to yourself, you know what?  This bitch is after my money, but here's what it is.  I'm going to give it to her because I got it every day anyway, but I'm going to show her  I'm better than this 10 motherfucking thousand.  I'm going to give this shit to the bitch.  She could be as shallow as she wants, but I'm better than this money in my pocket.  That's what women don't do.  They don't go, here's the pussy, nigga.  I need to find out if you can fuck anyway, so I'm going to fuck you now. 
[02:10:30]  But they try to get what we built through pussy.  We have what we built, but we're not trying to get pussy through it.  We just love having it.  We just have it.  But that's not our makeup.  Right, right.  That's not our makeup.  And dick's important.  That's the fucking thing.  This is, motherfuckers don't understand this.  It's not about, I don't know.  No, you're making your point.  There's other people making the point for the other side.  That's all.  There's a nice open discussion happening right here. 
[02:11:00]  Jimmy in Staten Island.  Jimmy.  Yo, good morning, boys.  Hey.  I want my wife.  It'll be 10 years on the 19th.  Okay?  I know what I have.  She may drive me up a fucking wall.  I want a cave of fucking skulls.  But you want to know what?  I know she's not a chickenhead fucking skag shallow bitch.  A lot of these girls today.  Okay?  Like, look at fucking Tiger.  Not poor Tiger.  Look at Tiger Woods.  They all got fucking agendas.  That bitch saved emails, saved fucking voicemails, attacks and shit. 
[02:11:30]  Why?  Because she was looking for the paycheck.  You can't even go to a hooah no more.  A hooah.  A hooah.  You can't even go to a hooah no more.  They're saving everything.  And having a loving good old lady is a beautiful thing, man.  It really is.  It's just a good thing.  I trust my girl.  But this has nothing to do with that.  No, no.  It has nothing to do with it.  Absolutely not.  I understand the basics of what you're saying, Patrice.  I really do. 
[02:12:00]  I do.  Another question, guys.  All right.  Let me say hi to James the Trucker.  James.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  I was going to say an agreement with Patrice to a degree.  Y'all know somebody that's one of the biggest, most egotistical, filthy, rich, motherfucking, ugly ass, dentures on the bedside, no talent, having motherfuckers with money.  Who's got a semi-good-looking woman because he's got money? 
[02:12:30]  Yep.  That's his pussy.  Who's?  He's just being in general.  He's saying in general.  Oh, you're just talking in general?  In general.  In general.  Who are you talking about, James?  The guy down the hall.  Oh, Jesus.  Not Steve, but the asshole with the long hair.  The one the company spent $500 million on.  Still don't know who you're talking about, sir.  I have no idea.  Oh, okay.  By the way, as you do your internet shit today, you're going to see that Howard is saying that he's not going to re-sign. 
[02:13:00]  That old gag.  That old gag.  It's negotiation bullshit that's going on.  He's just doing that.  Get his pants to get.  That old gag.  Shut up.  He's re-signing.  Don't figure it out.  Thank you, James.  All right.  Okay.  You want to move on to other things?  Yeah, it's fine by me.  I get it.  I get it.  I got it.  And you guys, by the way, you guys had me watch fucking Lawman. 
[02:13:30]  You didn't tell me to watch it.  Fucking Lawman.  It just came on, by the way.  And you got to watch him.  So why don't we talk about Lawman next?  Wow.  Out of his fucking mind, that guy.  But also, we got the conspiracy clips that Ann was talking about earlier.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I want to hear those two.  So which one do you want to do?  Oh, God damn.  At this point, we do have to take a break, then.  Jesse.  We still have an hour.  We'll squeeze both of them in.  Patrice O'Neal, Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  We'll take a quick break.  Obey and Anthony with Patrice O'Neal.  We got Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura. 
[02:14:00]  And we got Lawman.  I don't know what to do.  The fucking Jesse stuff's really good, Patrice.  We kind of talked about it.  You know I love Conspiracy Theories.  We'll do them both.  All right, we'll do both.  Cut out Lawman, because Lawman should be cut out.  That son of a bitch.  He's fantastic.  Oh, is it great?  Jesse is a complete ass.  Talked about him a little this morning when we first got on.  Watched the show last night.  I guess it's the second show that he's done so far.  The first one was on Harp. 
[02:14:30]  A big electronic antenna in Alaska.  Mind-controlling device.  And last night was 9-11.  And his whole take on 9-11 just makes you want to, I swear to God, it makes you want  to kick your fucking TV.  Why would the government want mind control when they have taxes already?  Yeah.  That keeps everyone in line.  Keeps everyone.  No one has time to try to get an uprising or anything going. 
[02:15:00]  And I said, why don't he use, why would they not use the Harp system that he said last  week to keep everyone's mind in control about 9-11?  Right.  You know, kind of cross-conspiracy.  How deep is the mind control thing, though?  Is it like, yes, master.  The way he talked about it, oh, it'll just fuck you up.  It caused a tsunami that killed, what?  Yeah, yeah.  A couple hundred thousand people.  It can do that.  It could shoot things from out of space. 
[02:15:30]  Weather shit.  It does everything.  It does everything.  Cuts you along.  Some of this stuff might be true.  I don't know.  Jesse's an ass.  Well, the 9-11 stuff is great.  And we started our show talking about this.  You want to start with the narrator?  You said the narrator's good at it?  Yeah, the narrator is great.  He talks about Jesse like, you know, he calls him the governor and says that when he's going  into these situations and describes, it makes it sound so important.  And it's just some fucking fat old wrestler walking around trying to get attention. 
[02:16:00]  This is Jesse.  Yeah, Jesse.  Don't call fucking Jesse a fat old wrestler.  He is.  A goddamn governor.  He was.  He was.  I'll buy it for the president.  Will you have to call the president?  And he was a great wrestler, by the way.  And the best Mike wrestler of all time.  Yeah.  Was he that good?  Great color commentator.  Let's not fucking belittle my friend.  People, you can take people's paths. 
[02:16:30]  He's lost a couple steps, though, Patrice.  You can take people's paths.  He's an old motherfucker.  And then now he's he's getting old and he's and there's some people who shouldn't be in  charge of enlightening people.  Yeah, I love Jesse.  He's one of them.  But he shouldn't be in charge.  Watch out, motherfuckers.  The world Nostradamus 2012 is like it's too.  You need somebody a little more subtle, a little more wit to fucking inform you that  the end of the world is.  I'm a Navy SEAL.  Dr. Michu Kaku. 
[02:17:00]  Explain the whole 2012.  Oh, my God.  Look at look at Jesse.  This is old school Jesse.  Oh, he's a great.  Meetwood Mac.  I've been partying with REO Speedwagon.  I've even arm wrestled the werewolf of London Warren Zevon.  I am the hottest thing in professional wrestling.  I am the baddest dude that walks the streets today, Chump Hogan.  And you think about that, Chump, because you could not beat me.  You could not even beat Sylvester Stallone in the movie Rocky.  It was a draw.  I'd have squashed that peanut in 30 seconds. 
[02:17:30]  Check it out.  I get more beautiful looking every day.  Holy shit.  Jesse was great on the mic, man.  Sad part is Hulk Hogan is still wrestling.  I know.  That's what's sad about these clips.  Dude, how sick is that?  Hulk is still fucking wrestling.  And look at Thunderlips.  That's when it was Thunderlips in the flesh, baby.  Yeah.  Why would he turn his back on Jesse Ventura? 
[02:18:00]  That's not smart in a wrestling ring.  Oh, you know it's going to happen.  We can't watch our wrestling fucking matches.  I want to hear him talk more.  I'm telling you, Jesse was, he's in the top five.  Ric Flair, Jesse, The Rock, Stone Cold, and I don't know who else.  There's one more.  But, oh, there it is.  Wait, top five.  Dusty Rhodes.  Top five mics.  Oh, Jesus.  Dusty Rhodes.  Dusty Rhodes.  Not in any order.  Dusty Rhodes, The Rock, Stone Cold, Ric Flair, Jesse the Body Ventura. 
[02:18:30]  I put those up against any guys you got on the mic.  Here's a little more, Jesse.  All right, hit it.  This is old school, Jesse.  I've heard you in recent weeks.  I hear them all.  Everybody wants to know Jesse the Body's private life because they know, me and Gene, that I date and take out some of the most beautiful women in the world.  I've heard that.  They go from a hair.  The hair.  The hair.  That's what they do.  Could I impose upon you to turn around if our cameraman could get a shot of this? 
[02:19:00]  Where in the world would one man on the street go, or a woman for that better, to get one's hair done such as yours?  Opal's glamorama.  Opal Gardner.  Opal Gardner.  Pine Valley.  But now let me say something else, Eugene.  I noticed something when I come out here right now.  Your pants leg is wet.  Now, you know what that tells me?  That tells me that in the short past, you've done had one Maurice Mad Dog Vashon out here, haven't you?  The animal himself. 
[02:19:30]  Well, the animal George Steele or something else.  Mean Gene was great, too.  He ruled.  Oh, Mean Gene.  Mean Gene ruled.  Genius.  He was great.  The way he looked, he made the faces all intimidated or sarcastic.  Genius.  Mean Gene ruled.  All right, why don't we get into the Jesse?  Jesse the Body, man.  Now we fast forward to last night.  Fast forward to last night.  The conspiracy show on.  He's a fucking babbling old man.  It's just an ass.  Oh, no.  Now Jesse steps into America's most controversial conspiracy. 
[02:20:00]  The attacks of 9-11.  If everything they told us was true, then why would they need to stonewall us?  Was the official 9-11 report a whitewash and cover-up?  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  These people are lying to us.  Did the terrorists use more than jetliners to do their devastating damage?  There's residues of explosives in the dust.  Is the FBI hiding the flight recorders they say have never been recovered? 
[02:20:30]  The odds of not finding these black boxes are almost zero.  And was ground zero a crime scene that Washington obliterated in plain sight?  There's something about 9-11 our government doesn't want us to know.  These are questions that few have dared to ask, let alone investigate.  Few?  Yeah, right?  What? 
[02:21:00]  Few?  Only everybody.  Everybody.  Only few have wondered if there's UFOs.  Just a couple.  Me and six other people.  Holy shit.  And I was freaking out at the TV.  I'm just yelling at the TV, talking about the black box recorders,  when nothing was left in that pile except I-beams.  There were fucking steel was left, some I-beams.  Everything else was just completely pulverized. 
[02:21:30]  Like I said, they didn't find chairs, desks, things like that, computer equipment, safes.  Like, there were safes in there.  Pulverized.  You could pulverize a safe?  Yes!  The intense heat and everything.  Here's the issue.  It's just like, it's Republican and Democrat.  It's like, we, none of us, we're only going by something that somebody else fucking investigated.  I understand that.  And if you think that there's pulverized safes anywhere, like pulverized safes. 
[02:22:00]  By, from heat and the fucking amount of friction and rock tumblers.  Heat where?  It was only one place where it was a lot of heat and that was where the plane hit.  Do you know what kind of heat is thrown off by the friction alone of all that shit?  It definitely generated a lot of heat.  It pulverized everything.  They didn't even find fucking, like, people.  Like, a few thousand people.  Just, just obliterated.  Gone. 
[02:22:30]  Can I ask a question?  Disappeared.  You still, to this day, think, is there any conspiracy theory that you believe, that you believe to be a conspiracy?  I think, uh...  Hidden agendas, something wrong.  I believe that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was like, you know, that was, let's get into Vietnam, let's, you know, fuck with some shit.  So, so, so you believe in that.  But at some point, you, at some point, all the rest of the reasons that we get into these crazy wars was legitimate. 
[02:23:00]  Well, no, I look at everyone on its separate, you know, merits, but as far as 9-11 goes, I sat there, I watched planes fly into the buildings.  I watched the buildings collapse, not by fucking, uh, some kind of explosive devices that were planted.  They fell exactly where the planes hit.  That's where they first started crumbling and, and collapsed.  It wasn't like this big, you ever watch buildings that get exploded by the demolition crew? 
[02:23:30]  You hear, and, and the, and the, the fucking building up, you see the lights of the explosives.  It wasn't like that.  It fell because planes hit it.  And you know what?  But there's a lot of fucking planes hit it.  There's a lot of credible, I, I, as we all did, I don't say that that, that didn't happen.  Hey, what a coincidence.  There's some credible people that say some credible things and, and you can believe them or you can name, but name a credible, well, let me not say credible because I don't know their credentials. 
[02:24:00]  Sorry.  No, but you have a point.  No, some dudes that, hold on, hold on, because that's the point Anthony made this morning with this guy that Jesse talked to.  And then you did a little Google search and realized the guy is a retired FBI guy.  I mean, and Jesse's making believe it's some credible person though.  Why isn't he credible?  Why, why is he retired?  He's fucking done.  Perhaps he had a fucking, uh, falling out with his fucking superiors. 
[02:24:30]  Look, perhaps he's got a fucking, you know, problem.  I've seen a thing, I've seen a movie called, uh, uh, America, uh, freedom to fascism.  And they've had IRS agents, ex IRS agents, which you can see why, who say that the federal income tax is, is illegal and it doesn't exist.  Yeah.  But they're credible motherfuckers saying it because they were legitimately all IRS agents.  And they're saying, look, and this is one of the, the lady said, she goes in the USA today, a group put out a $50,000 reward for anyone that can prove that federal income tax exists. 
[02:25:00]  Mm-hmm.  And lady, it was a black lady.  She's like, shit, I'll get that money and I'll fucking tell them that it exists.  Could never prove that it's, that, that we should be fucking charged federal income tax.  Don't pay your taxes.  I'm, see what happens. 
[02:25:30]  But listen though, see, here's, now what you're doing here is saying this.  Yes, it may be illegal, but the fact that the motivation for me to pay this illegal tax is that the police will come and get me.  Right.  Which in itself is fucked up.  I mean, the fact that we are, that the law is the police coming to get you.  So what I'm saying is either side makes sense.  So it's, it's a matter, it's, it's your inclination of which side you want to be on.  But as far as, as far as 9-11 goes, just the 9-11 thing, I can't say, the, the, the answer seems to be the easiest one. 
[02:26:00]  Very convenient though.  Fanatic Muslim militants that have been fucking picking on us for years already had tried to take down the Trade Center with the fucking Ryder Truck bomb.  Already tried, it's their fucking prize, fucking, uh, terrorist event.  And, and they caught us napping, they caught us with our intelligence, uh, not speaking to each other, FBI, CIA, all that shit, not trading, uh, intelligence information. 
[02:26:30]  Other people telling them, look, there's guys training, uh, to fly planes.  All right, we'll check into it, we'll do this.  There's warrants that weren't served, all the shit.  It, no, it's more, you make the face, but here it is.  I'm, I'm doing, I'm making a face of what you just said.  Like, that there's, there's chatter and people know that things are going to happen.  Let me make it easier for you.  Okay.  Even easier than what I just said for you.  I believe it's more government incompetence than government intelligence and conspiracy and look how great our government can fucking, uh, uh, make a secret and, and they were stupid. 
[02:27:00]  There's, there's four, and, and the one I don't know about is the Korean War.  But in, in four major conflicts that America had, before we got involved in the conflict, we couldn't because we did not have support from the entire country because there wasn't an event to garner us being in there. 
[02:27:30]  We want to be in wars because it fucking, it's money.  The banks want us to be in wars because it's, it enables them to lend zillions of dollars to the government so they can have to pay them back with our money.  Right.  Now, World War I, we wanted to get in, couldn't.  What event happened that got us in?  The main.  The, the, the, the, no, the Lusitania.  I thought it was, uh, remember the main.  No, the, the, the, the Lusitania was sunk by German, German boats. 
[02:28:00]  What's the main for? Spanish-American?  I don't know.  It should.  But the Lusitania was sunk, uh, a battleship full of, uh, people was sunk by a torpedo.  Yeah.  Gets us mad enough to get in.  Pearl Harbor, there's, there's, there's things that say that, uh.  So who sunk the ship, our own government?  That, they, not our own government, but what you were saying, things just, they allow things to happen so that we can get involved.  I heard Pearl Harbor, there was warnings from Australia that, hey man, the fucking Japs is getting together to come see you motherfuckers. 
[02:28:30]  And they were like, shh, it's okay.  And they didn't, we didn't do it ourselves.  The Gulf of Tonkin was a complete fake thing that gave us, and, and now, I'm just saying, 9-11 happened.  I'm not saying we fucking murdered our own people, but things happened to get us galvanized, to get into a conflict, two conflicts, that people now are like, why the fuck are we there? 
[02:29:00]  I do agree, uh, to a certain extent with everything you just said.  We had complete, uh, justifiable cause to go into Iraq at the time, if he wanted to push it.  We did.  He was completely blowing off the sanctions, and, uh, uh, uh, the UN, uh, sanctions.  We had a reason.  What, the guys going in to see about the missiles? 
[02:29:30]  This is before 9-11.  They let those guys in.  Before 9-11.  Right.  Nah, and then he threw him the fuck out, and then you had that fucking, what's his name, Hans Blix.  I don't know if that's declaration of invading your fucking country.  Yeah.  And killing their leader.  Murdering a dictator that they had business with years ago.  Big business.  Oh, the, uh, the Iraqi people put him to death.  Patrice is gonna kill you.  They hung him.  Didn't you see the video?  It was great.  It was their own people. 
[02:30:00]  It was his own people.  Look, I don't think there's some dirty dealings going on, man.  I think it gets dirty.  There's some dirty dealings.  But I absolutely.  You gotta look at each one individually, though.  I don't see 9-11 as being, uh, perpetrated by the government in any way.  I can't even see him saying, all right, man.  Michael Moore had one of the greatest takes on this I've ever heard.  Oh, boy. 
[02:30:30]  Simple.  So, if 19 Koreans attacked America, they would say Korea attacked America.  Oh, right, right, yeah.  19 Saudi Arabians attacked America, yet we attack Iraq.  I'm, it just, it just makes sense.  That, that statement, whether you like Michael Moore or not, it just makes sense.  If, if it was fucking 19 Africans, Africa attacked America. 
[02:31:00]  But, but for some reason, it wasn't Saudi Arabia.  It was, here's the thing.  Having a, having a war on terror is like having a war on ugly.  It's just, you can't.  It doesn't make any sense.  It's subjective.  Yes.  It's just, I'm going to attack terror?  Well, it's, it's convenient, dude.  And it's not, I don't know if it's righteous enough.  All right, let's get to these clips, man.  Let's get to the Jesse clips.  All right, let's hear a little Jesse.  So, Jesse Oren owes his, owes his dedication to the victims. 
[02:31:30]  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  It was Jesse from last night.  With 9-11, some things just never added up for me.  Why weren't those jetliners brought down?  Why did the buildings go down so quickly?  I knew this investigation was going to get some people pretty angry.  But I also knew I owed this one to the victims.  Oh, shut up.  And then he had some lackey there to give the opposing point so people wouldn't get completely 
[02:32:00]  bent out of shape, out of their minds with Jesse.  They had his flunky going, well, governor, you know, I'm not going to sit here and believe that.  What's his credentials?  The flunky?  Flunky?  Like you never heard of the guy before or nothing like that?  No, it's his team of investigators.  See, Jesse's got a team of investigators and they go to the war room and they talk and  I don't know who they are.  There's some English black chick, there's some other black guy, there's two white guys. 
[02:32:30]  Which tells you they're not credible right away.  There's a nigglet and another motherfucker.  There's a darkie and a nigglet up there talking their nonsense.  There's some English black chick with buck-fucking teeth.  Which makes her fucking discredits her right away.  I discredit her.  That funny tooth nigglet from England.  She don't know what she's talking about.  Don't gnaw on an apple through a chain link fence, you fucking.  With that said, we go to the war room.  William Rodriguez, his theory?  Yeah.  What's the William Rodriguez theory? 
[02:33:00]  I forgot.  Last man out of the last tower.  Oh, he was the last man out.  He said he heard explosions.  Two explosions.  And he felt himself thrust up.  And they said they came from below the explosions.  Not above.  And it was before the plane hit the building he was in.  Now, I'm assuming.  Why don't you believe that?  I'm assuming it's the plane.  Because I'm assuming it's the plane that hit the first fucking building that he heard this kaboom.  When everything fell down and fucking hit the ground in the basement of both buildings. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, that's why I don't.  But you just, that's just conjecture what you just did.  You just based it on, fuck that, I don't believe it.  And some fucking jowl.  That's what we do as human beings.  You know what?  No, no.  I'm not.  I'm just trying to make sure you know that's what you're doing.  I also based it on what I read from the 9-11 commission.  All right.  Well, they were lying.  Is that anything like the lawyer commission?  I guess so.  They were lying, too.  Is that anything like the commission that said fucking JFK didn't, got shot by one motherfucker with a bullet that had feet? 
[02:34:00]  I'll listen to a fucking, some janitor that ran out of the fucking building.  Some janitor?  If I get fucking...  And heard explosions.  You know something?  When a plane hits a fucking building, you're going to probably hear some explosions.  Anthony, what credibility as a professional do you need to feel something?  Are you saying that the milkman can't fucking get shot?  I'm saying that if a plane hits a fucking...  If a plane hits a fucking building and debris falls into the basement, you're going to hear explosions in the fucking basement, is what I'm saying. 
[02:34:30]  That's what he said he did.  No, he was...  Jesse assumed they were...  And there's fucking firemen.  There's fucking firemen who say that some funny shit happened over there, man.  So there were explosives placed in the basement, then.  That's what fucking some firemen say.  It's insanity to even speculate that explosives were brought into the World Trade Center.  Why bother?  You got two planes.  You got the planes. 
[02:35:00]  You got planes.  Why bother with explosives?  You didn't even need the...  Explosives.  You didn't even need the buildings to come down.  Why take that chance?  You didn't need the buildings to come down?  That someone's going to fucking catch somebody planting explosives when you got two planes.  And you're comfortable with building seven.  That's one thing I'm not comfortable with.  Yeah, I'm comfortable with building seven because it was hit by fucking building two.  And fire was raging in building seven.  And that's why it fell down.  I saw a thing where it was just like...  It's very difficult.  Again, I'm saying shit that I saw that helps my belief. 
[02:35:30]  It did not look like a controlled demolition.  It's very difficult for a build in the fall.  It's very hard.  I've watched controlled demolitions.  I've seen a thousand of the fucking things.  None of them looked like either the towers, one or two, or seven.  Just didn't look like it.  None?  None.  The way they just came down straight?  The way they fall down straight.  Okay, one thing looked like it.  Nothing else.  There's explosions that go on.  There are timed explosions that have to go off in sequence to make those buildings fall like that. 
[02:36:00]  I know what you're going to say, but...  And there's equipment, and they gut them.  Those little pictures they have of those little...  ...and spring-loaded, and they have...  Those little explosions coming out the building that they...  The pictures they...  They weren't timed.  What, nothing?  Is this a controlled demolition?  Here's a controlled demolition of a building.  Now, we're sitting and watching.  La-dee-dee.  Now, watch.  Watch.  Boom, boom, boom.  Look.  All the flashes going off.  You see the flashes going off?  It takes a while.  Look.  Holy shit.  Boom, boom.  There it is. 
[02:36:30]  That's a controlled demolition.  Boy, that looked like fucking world tracing to me.  Get the fuck out of here.  God.  They were strobe lights, it looked like.  Planet World Tracer are falling.  They were timed.  Did you see the timing where it looked like lightning shooting up the side of the building?  They have pictures where they're saying that they have those flashes and the...  Just pressure.  Things blowing up.  When a building collapses, shit's going to blow up as it's falling.  Anthony, when the fuck did you become Johnny Architect?  You don't think there was no...  You're just deciding that it's just missing it. 
[02:37:00]  You don't think there was a fucking generator somewhere with a fuel tank that explodes?  Oh, you know what, though?  Look, look.  All right, fair enough.  There ain't no fucking explosion going on there.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  And it happens to fall exactly where the plane went in?  Where the plane went in.  You're right.  I mean, this is silly to think.  I mean, that's fair.  Let me see the other one.  I mean, that's fair.  That's fair.  That is fair, because it happened right...  It did...  Yeah, right where the plane hit.  I haven't seen that footage in a long time.  Yeah, I know.  I haven't seen it in a long time.  That's fair. 
[02:37:30]  That's fair.  I mean, I'm just not buying that thing.  Well, can we go to the war room and do the Willie...  The Willie.  The William Rodriguez theory here.  Yeah, let's hear the janitor.  He was there the day that the towers were hit.  And William swears up and down, this is the intriguing part, that an explosion took place below them.  About six to eight seconds before anything happened way up above.  Below?  Below.  Why come out now?  What's he getting from this?  Come out now? 
[02:38:00]  He was brought in front of the 9-11 commission.  They took him in a private room.  He testified for 30 minutes.  And today, there's no record of him even being there.  Any chance he's not in the record because his story doesn't check out?  His story contradicts the official story, Alex, pretty severely, doesn't it?  But even if...  The bombs going off below.  Well, if you don't want that out to the public, why would you acknowledge William Rodriguez in any way, shape, or form?  To just deny or not even acknowledge that the guy testified?  Come on, that's a little shady. 
[02:38:30]  And they wouldn't call you to testify unless you had something credible to say.  We're going to check out William Rodriguez.  Now get me somebody else.  Now get me somebody else.  Get me Hulk Hogan.  Well, now we get a physics professor from Salt Lake.  What's this about?  What's the physics professor all about?  Maybe he starts talking about thermite, super thermite paint.  We are going to look at Stephen Jones.  He's a former physics professor from Brigham Young University. 
[02:39:00]  Now he analyzed dust samples from September 11th and says that he found explosive residue in it.  Oh, that's what this guy is.  Sorry.  Really?  As soon as he published his findings, he was forced to leave his post at Brigham Young.  No kidding?  No.  So he was effectively fired.  Alex, get on a plane.  Get up to Salt Lake City, interview Professor Jones, find out anything you can about this.  You got it.  Yeah, I'm on it.  Dr. Jones. 
[02:39:30]  Dr. Jones.  Interview Dr. Jones.  Dr. Jones.  It's ridiculous.  This guy said that there was explosive residue on the beams.  There's another guy on YouTube I saw, another scientific thing that you saw probably,  about dropping an egg from the top of the World Trade Center.  It took, it takes like, from the top of the World Trade Center, it took eight seconds or 
[02:40:00]  nine seconds with no resistance for an egg to hit.  And it's like, the buildings dropped in nine seconds with resistance or something?  That's not true.  Because I go.  I'm paraphrasing.  People love to say it.  I know, I know.  But did you see the thing I'm talking about, first of all?  Probably not the exact video, but I mean, if you time it, if you just look at the Trade  Center collapse and actually time it, it's longer than nine seconds.  It is.  It's longer than nine seconds.  It's longer.  But I'm saying, the guy, if he's going nine or whatever he did, he made a scientific point 
[02:40:30]  that with no resistance, this is how long it took for something to fall.  And with resistance, it took a short period of time.  And again, it might not have been nine.  It's on YouTube.  That's what I'm saying.  You got to see it to say, okay, fuck him.  And then blah, blah, blah.  But I'm saying, there's enough, there's people that aren't fruitcakes that are saying things  that make sense.  I'm sure there are.  I just.  You just don't believe it. 
[02:41:00]  And no matter what a person says that makes sense, it's not going to fucking.  I think the easiest explanation is that fanatical Muslims figured out a weakness and fucking  nailed us.  Got us with our panties down.  True.  That's what I think.  Why is that?  But I don't think our panties were.  Why is that so hard to believe?  I think more or less we might have been relaxing with our panties down as opposed to, oh shit,  somebody stuck us in the ass with my panties down.  I think maybe the panties were just down. 
[02:41:30]  We were relaxing with our panties down.  We were down on purpose.  Was it on purpose?  I don't know about that.  We needed something big to get us in war.  When you get.  And there's another statement called.  There's another thing about this guy.  It was called Why We Fight.  Fucking guy was interesting, credible, motherfucker.  Felt like it.  He goes that there's a thing called blowback.  There's a term called blowback.  And blowback is things that happen to America. 
[02:42:00]  Fucked up things that other countries do to us based on things that we do to them that our people don't know about.  So, the 9-11 attack could have been blowback for some fucking shady shit we did to them.  And they, and America knew it, but just doesn't fucking tell us these things, man.  Again, it just seems to me more complicated than the simplest of explanations.  Is every bus that blows up in Tel Aviv some conspiracy? 
[02:42:30]  Is every terrorist attack that happens?  Look at Mumbai.  Mumbai was just motherfuckers walking around with pistol shoot people.  Right.  I'm saying, in Spain, the subway, the train station bombings in Spain, was that a conspiracy?  England, with the fucking buses exploding.  But do you notice, how come?  Do you notice internally, nothing else ever happens after that, except for that incident?  We're the only thing that this kind of thing happened where it ends up being World War fucking 3. 
[02:43:00]  Because we're not used to it happening.  We're very not used to things like this happening to us.  The train blows up in Madrid.  No one's used to trains blowing up in Madrid.  No one's used to walking through a mall and getting shot with an AK-47 every day.  Because it wouldn't be news if it happened all the time.  But we're the only country that got attacked where, ultimately, the people who didn't attack us were attacked. 
[02:43:30]  Iraq was attacked based on 19 Saudi Arabians.  Right, right.  But, you know what, no, no.  How do you dismiss that, though?  Afghanistan was attacked because of 19 Saudi Arabians and the Al-Qaeda and Taliban and training camps and all that bullshit that was happening in Afghanistan.  Weapons of mass destruction have been proved to be horseshit, right?  That's bullshit, right.  Is it horseshit?  Oh, complete horseshit.  But that's why we fucked with Iraq.  I know.  That's the lie.  Anthony, how do you dismiss?  You can't dismiss that shit. 
[02:44:00]  If you want to talk about a lie, that's the lie I'll agree with.  But how can, after that lie, how do you fucking go, but the other thing was just a righteous attack?  Because could you see, honestly, could you see people sitting there and going, look, we need to get into a war.  Let's say, wait, wait, let's say that there's weapons of mass destruction.  We'll make up some shit.  We'll take some photos that people really can't see.  We'll say this is a mobile fucking nerve gas factory. 
[02:44:30]  We'll say that that I can say completely.  Do you think there's a meeting in a corporation where they go, you know, fluoride is poison.  We don't know what to do with it.  Don't say nothing.  Let's just dump it in a fucking river where people drink and then lie to them and say fluoride helps your insides and your teeth.  Do you believe that it's possible that people just say, fuck us?  No, I can't.  I can't see people getting together and going, wow, we got very good intelligence.  That planes are going to fly into the World Trade Center on September 11th. 
[02:45:00]  And they just sit back and go, a few thousand people getting killed.  There's a term for that.  It's called collateral damage.  There's a term that exists for people who die, unfortunately, behind our bullshit.  And where are the motherfuckers that usually dole out the collateral damage?  Collateral damage.  I really have a hard time thinking.  Fanatics and an incompetent government fits the bill more than a conspiracy. 
[02:45:30]  Fanatics and a cooperative government.  And why would Saudi Arabia want us dead so bad when we fucking love them?  It wasn't the Saudi government.  It was they were from Saudi Arabia, but they're fucking fanatic Muslims.  They're fanatic Muslims.  There's fucking right now.  There's a bunch of guys from fucking the United States.  Five of them just arrested in Pakistan.  I believe American Muslims. 
[02:46:00]  The climate is beautiful.  I think the climate, the hatred for America is very easy.  And the thing I'm agreeing with you on is that fanatics did it.  But the climate gives us the opportunity for people to do things that we need them to do.  Patsies, puppets, and anybody else who's just going to do things we need to do to do what we need.  Like, for instance, you know who we want bad.  We want three people bad.  We want fucking North Korea bad.  I mean, North Korea we want bad. 
[02:46:30]  We want Armadillo bad.  And we want fucking, uh, the guy from, uh, no, uh, Puerto Rican dude, uh, Chavez.  Oh, Chavez.  So don't be surprised if something happens to give us a reason to fuck with them and the American public agrees with it.  That's all I'm saying.  Something will happen where we have to go fuck up Ahmadinejad.  Occasionally things do happen.  Well, Ahmadinejad, you know, perfect timing so that let's say Israel. 
[02:47:00]  He goes in with an airstrike to take out their nuclear power plants.  That'll be a conspiracy, that there really weren't nuclear power plants.  Why can't it be that he is building nuclear power plants to build bombs?  They have missiles that could hit parts of Israel.  Well, we have them.  Israel has them.  Why are we allowed to have them?  Russia has them.  Why are they allowed to have them?  Because in the world order, they have not been determined to be responsible enough to have these weapons. 
[02:47:30]  In the United States of Anthony Cumia, okay, you're fighting for the right to have your gun.  Yeah.  In the United States where you're the dictator, I'm across the street making decisions on your fucking competence or whether you have your fucking 50 cal or not.  It's a world decision.  The world, the United Nations, the World Nuclear Regulatory Commission, they're the ones that make the decisions on who can have nuclear power. 
[02:48:00]  First of all, if you want nuclear power to power your shit, fine.  But inspectors are going to come in.  They're going to want to know where that enriched uranium is going.  They're going to want to know a lot of shit.  Do you think Iraq or Iran has shown they're responsible enough?  No, I mean 9-11 in itself.  Oh, 9-11?  Anything.  Something shady with 9-11?  No, I just see it as a series of a lot of fucking mistakes.  I don't think there's anything shady with it. 
[02:48:30]  I think there's like, you could take people that fucked up royally and twist it around and go,  Oh, did he fuck up?  Or was it a guy?  No, he fucked up.  I've worked in this country with enough people to know, no matter where you go, assholes work there.  And I believe there were enough assholes working for the CIA, the FBI, police organizations,  people that wouldn't listen to other people, that they just fucked up. 
[02:49:00]  I mean, there's some old, what's the FBI guy?  ...bombed by these motherfuckers.  Embassies were being bombed.  True that.  So it's not like the World Trade Center just came out of someone's ass.  Oh, Muslims did this?  Why?  They've been peaceful people to us for years.  True that.  They were fucking blowing every shit up on us.  But I'm saying that they are just the assholes people might need to do bigger things.  To get something done? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, because their attacks are, again, going to only kill collateral damage type of numbers.  World Trade Center, 2,000 people, that was the amount of people needed to die for us as a country to say,  kill anybody you want.  Because we didn't, if you said, if that happened, if the planes hit and we saw that,  we are waiting for someone to go, this is who we're going to fuck up.  Well, go fuck them up!  Now, if they had said, America, who do you think did this? 
[02:50:00]  Let's go fuck them up.  You decide.  What do you think we would have said?  We would have been like, I, uh, Saddam?  We could have said, we could have said Florida if we wanted to.  Right, right.  Florida did this.  And go bomb fucking Florida.  We was ready for, we could have spent the wheel, the axis of evil wheel.  Yeah.  Who so, who do you want to kill?  And kill them. 
[02:50:30]  Period.  I think it helped push an agenda forward.  I do believe that.  Yeah, after the fact.  Of course it did.  Holy shit.  It made it easy whether the government might have turned away at the last second there.  You show me, you show me.  Right, you don't know.  I understand they capitalized on it.  Show me the diabolical plan.  I completely understand that part of the whole angle.  Show me the diabolical plan.  Show me the group of people that can keep a fucking secret.  Show me the, that's another thing.  I don't, I don't believe any of that shit.  You can't fucking keep, two people can't keep a secret.  They're all like these fucking Tiger Wood bitches. 
[02:51:00]  They'd be out of the woodwork going on the fucking News of the World next to the alien  pictures.  I saw the black box.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're missing out on some great Jesse Clips through this whole thing.  Him peeking in windows, trying locked doors.  Oh, him amazed that a door is locked at JFK.  Yeah, we'll get into it.  Well, fucking Jesse, it's an airport asshole.  And the famous super thermite discussion.  Right after the break.  Hitler, there's a picture of Hitler meeting an alien.  Yeah, see, it's possible. 
[02:51:30]  When did that happen?  Holy shit.  They gave him the secrets of the V2 rocket.  Hey man, that's some good.  They didn't have photo shot back then.  No.  That's gotta be real.  It's gotta be true.  He's like, you don't like Jews either?  God damn.  Never liked them.  Quick break and we'll do the rest of the Jesse Venturi clips.  They're fucking up Saturn.  Jews run the universe.  And we're finally back.  A lot of fucking promos in there.  Holy shit. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Hey, let's not forget.  A week from today is the homeless shopping spree, Ed.  It is.  A week from today.  A week from today goes down.  Goodness gracious.  We gotta figure that shit out.  We're doing afternoon drive that day, Ed.  What?  Yeah.  That'll screw my sleep schedule up for a month.  But we're excited.  I hope you guys are gonna join us.  We're gonna announce the mall early next week.  Yeah.  Take next Thursday off so you can join us and watch the homeless shop for some shit.  Yeah.  What time does that happen?  I don't know. 
[02:52:30]  I think we're doing like three to seven, two to seven, something like that.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Going old school.  Doing a little afternoon drive.  This company better understand when we do fucking afternoon drive, there has to be beer in the area.  Yes, there's drinking during afternoon drive.  It's the only way I know how to do it, I think.  If we're going old school, we gotta like make sure everything is done properly.  Fucking windy out, huh?  I guess.  Just saying. 
[02:53:00]  Not in Las Vegas.  No?  No.  I mean, New York.  Yeah.  I always assume people know where we're broadcasting from.  Yeah, I know.  You know, pinnacle of the free world.  That place.  Yeah.  So, homeless shopping spree.  Let's not forget, we want a nice turnout next Thursday, the 17th.  Yeah.  It'll be in the afternoon.  Okay, Jesse Ventura, we get right back into the conspiracy show.  Yes.  9-11 was the topic last night, and we get into the super thermite. 
[02:53:30]  Jesse Ventura is investigating the 9-11 conspiracy, and it claimed that the World Trade Towers were  brought down by an explosive substance called super thermite.  Sure, they were hit by planes, but I'm saying that's not the full story, because there's  residues of explosives in the dust.  Oh, well.  Good enough for me.  Residue of explosives in the dust.  Really?  Is there? 
[02:54:00]  Maybe some guy was bringing explosives to work.  Yeah.  It was some guy.  It was in his file cabinet.  Some dude.  Just keeping explosives on hand.  On the 12th floor, there was an explosive place nobody knew about.  Maybe he had his own plan that he never was able to do.  He had some dumb plan, because he was mad he didn't get a raise.  After testing super thermite, dramatic out.  As we expected, the beam of the thermite is burning much brighter.  It's a much hotter fire than we had before.  So the temperature is going to rise in this beam more than it would in the beam without 
[02:54:30]  the thermite.  Does it burn long enough and hot enough so that we have structural failure?  All right.  Anybody still got any doubts?  Alex?  I do.  I mean, listen, it's one thing to say that this thing can be liquid.  I hate Alex.  Alex is the flunky.  Alex is the flunky that has to take the opposing view so that, like, Jesse, the body  doesn't have assassins coming after him.  He's a Washington general. 
[02:55:00]  The Harlem Globetrotters had to play somebody.  Yeah.  That's exactly what he's doing.  He's just taking the opposing point.  Sort of taking it.  Sort of.  Yeah.  Got any doubts, Alex?  I do.  I mean, listen, it's one thing to say that this thing can be liquefied and used as paint.  It's another thing to say that it was used at the World Trade Center site.  Rodriguez told me construction was a daily thing there.  Yeah.  That every floor, when a tenant moved out, construction took place.  What happens then?  Painting.  And painters could be painting this stuff on and not even know it. 
[02:55:30]  Imagine if this stuff was painted on buildings in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., all  over the country.  There you go.  That stuff could be everywhere.  Oh, God.  I hear.  That stuff could be everywhere.  Oh, my God.  What?  Bullshit?  Your bullshit?  First of all, yeah, construction went on.  That's a fucking...  Oh, Patrice, come on.  There's the answer to how, though.  Let me...  Let me...  All right.  I'm saying, look... 
[02:56:00]  You're right.  I know what you're saying.  I'm not saying I believe it, but I'm looking for any logical way of a conspiracy.  Yeah.  Okay?  One time, a crazy guy explained space travel, where people can't explain how space people  can move quick.  Right.  And the guy goes, oh, you just manipulate...  They learn how to manipulate the magnets between each planet.  And so they just have magnet...  They've used magnetization, magnetism to move. 
[02:56:30]  So I'm just saying, you could go, I'll fuck you.  But I'm saying, to paint explosives on...  Yeah.  ...buildings...  Right.  ...and then detonate them somehow is a logical, crazy way to, like, why the secrets?  Right.  Because people are doing things that they don't know.  Can I, as an expert, dispel this?  We like comic books.  Go ahead, Alex.  I mean, Anthony.  I'm an expert at this because...  I would love for you to debate Jesse Ventura instead of stupid Alex. 
[02:57:00]  I know.  I was in the trades for a while.  I've been in buildings where, yeah, one tenant moves out, another one moves in.  They move around internal walls, cubicles, things like that.  When they paint walls, they don't rip the fucking sheetrock and insulation down and paint  the fucking main structural beams with thermite paint.  They paint the sheetrock on the walls.  They showed a metal beam with this super thermite paint on it, light up like a sparkler. 
[02:57:30]  By the way, it didn't melt the beam or anything.  Right.  They cut away.  It did nothing to the beam.  Wait.  So, hold on.  If it was going to melt the beam, why wouldn't they just go all in and wait for the beam  to melt and go, see, this is what thermite paint actually does?  Because it didn't melt the beam, as we saw on, I think, Mythbusters showed something  like that.  So, why would he cut away from that?  Unless he couldn't prove his own dumb point he was trying to make.  Because he couldn't prove his own dumb point.  But he had all the time in the world to let the fucking fire burn.  Yeah. 
[02:58:00]  You paint sheetrock.  Could you imagine if at the World Trade Center, every floor at some point had to be painted  behind the sheetrock walls?  They had to rip sheetrock out of 110 stories twice.  Asbestos is just one of them things that's on the structures, man.  Who's the bestest?  What?  The bestest.  I's the bestest.  Asbestos.  I'm the bestest.  You asbestos go as fast as you can, motherfucker. 
[02:58:30]  It's unbelievable how he...  You had your hour.  Let's have fun with the Jesse Mentor Eclipse.  You're killing me.  You're killing me.  Everywhere.  Because now we get into Jesse going down to the crime scene.  Yes.  Come on now.  Crime scene, Jesse.  Jesse's being thorough, man.  You got a little chest.  Let's listen to this clip.  After seeing that, there was only one place to go next.  I headed to ground zero.  I didn't expect to find any super thermite. 
[02:59:00]  But I also didn't expect to find so many victim survivors still looking for answers.  Why wouldn't you expect to find victim survivors at the Trade Center site?  That's where they go.  That's where people go, Jesse.  I sure didn't expect to see construction workers.  You know, this is fair.  We got a fireman that was down at ground zero.  Paul in New York is out of his mind.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How's things? 
[02:59:30]  All right, Paul.  Listen, you know, like, Patrice, I can kind of, you know, see your point where you're  saying, all right, with the government, you know, they had to pick a sacrificial number  and a sacrificial place, you know, and you spin the death wheel of fortune.  But using that same logic, would they still, you know, say, all right, we're going to blow  up the White House.  We're going to blow up the Pentagon.  Our own people who are spinning that wheel, we're going to send two planes there also.  You fly into that, too?  Yeah, the plane never hit the Pentagon. 
[03:00:00]  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, it was a missile, sir.  Because we had to deal with that shit, too.  Unbelievable.  And nothing hit the Pentagon, or no plane did.  And in addition to this whole, the whole Trade Center thing, with this explosions and  the thermite, Jesse's a tool.  He was a tool last year when you were on the radio.  I tried to get through.  But, you know, he had no idea about how a building collapsed.  It's called a pancake collapse.  The plane's hit up on the 80-something floor.  That shit burnt out, you know, and it collapses like a pancake. 
[03:00:30]  Once it's...  And as every floor is collapsing, we were watching a YouTube video, the air is now pushing everything  out, making it look like little explosions are happening.  That's actually air leaving that floor, because the air has nowhere else to go.  He's a fireman?  Yes, correct.  A question, sir?  Aren't there...  There are, on record, some firemen who say, hey, some strange shit happened, like some  explosions happened that had nothing to do with the plane. 
[03:01:00]  Like, there are firemen who are corroborating some of this stuff, right?  I'll be honest with you.  I don't know any firemen.  I was there that day.  I work with a lot of firemen that were there that day.  It was a lot of crazy shit.  But when you look at the big picture, the big picture, just collapsing, guys were getting  blown over.  There was ambulances being blown over on their roof.  What do you think that happened from?  That happened from the force of those buildings coming straight down like a friggin' earthquake. 
[03:01:30]  Guys were getting blown over shit, you know.  So ultimately, do you personally believe that this was just what it was?  There was just nothing else involved?  Like, what it was is what it was.  It was an attack, that happened, and then life just happened the way it happened.  But there was no, there was no, there was nothing else.  I'm just asking what you believe.  I believe it was, I believe it was just that it was an attack, probably preceding it.  You know, there was a lot of drop balls by the government, by whoever. 
[03:02:00]  But as far as conspiracy that we went there and blew up the building, you know, that they're  using this super thermite crap, the friggin' white beams were melting.  The beams were melting because it was friggin' tens of thousands of gallons of jet fuel, which  is essentially diesel fuel, okay, which burned hotter than gasoline.  You know, that shit was burning for days, for months.  That is what caused the friggin' failure.  Not some tools spraying friggin', you know, stuff that had, you know, thermite on a friggin' 
[03:02:30]  People forget, the guys were trying to put this fire out for what, almost a month afterwards?  Months, three or four months.  Three or four months afterwards, the damn thing was still burning.  Because all the fuel went down the staircase and was burning down in the basement.  So, you know, of course, when the first plane hit, you know, all that stuff was falling  down into the basement.  You know, it could have caught a spark, could have made a, you know, a small explosion.  But, you know, there was nobody in there friggin' placing PNT and blowing down the building.  Well, what about, and with number seven, you know, number seven Trade Center, I was right 
[03:03:00]  down the block from that, on Vesey Street.  That thing was burning.  There was fire blowing out the windows on every floor for hours.  And they kept telling us, the building's coming down, the building's going to come down.  And then finally, they blew the warning sign because they had guys with transit set up  to watch the building lean.  They didn't commit anybody to that.  That thing was burning, like, out of control.  And that's what brought that down, plus the damage from, you know, from the building that 
[03:03:30]  fell on top of it.  Yeah.  So, I think Jesse's, he's out of his mind, this guy.  I'm glad I finally got through because I've been the whole way home trying to dial and  call up.  Awesome.  I got through, man.  You guys are great.  Keep up the good work.  All right, Paul.  Great job, man.  Good phone call.  Let's go to Ryan in Minnesota.  Ryan.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  Good.  Hey, you know, I don't.  I don't believe this whole thing is a huge conspiracy, but I did see an interesting video  at a friend of mine's house one time.  The video of that demolition truck, of those demolition crews that were leaving the scene 
[03:04:00]  that someone caught a glimpse of with their video camera.  What was painted on the side?  Acme?  Was there a coyote driving the fucking truck?  Oh, my God.  If you were going to fucking do this, what, would you have a truck that says demolition?  Demolition on the side of the truck?  Or would you be like, incog fucking neato?  I can't talk about this shit anymore!  Even close encounters know to put piggly wiggly signs on the side of their trucks. 
[03:04:30]  No, you would make it very obvious.  Demolition.  Maybe a nice fucking picture of dynamite.  World Trade Center.  No offense, Ryan.  I'm sorry, but I am so sick of trying to discuss this in general at this point.  Acme demolition.  Official demolition crew of the World Trade Center Explosions.  Right, right.  What the fuck do you think of this?  Wild E. Coyote.  Super genius.  Sam.  All right, brother. 
[03:05:00]  I don't mean to yell, but...  I was on the side of Acme.  Hey, hold on.  Ryan, thank you, though.  Let me go to John in Connecticut.  He's a regular to the show.  He lost his son in Iraq, which is important to his phone call there, Patrice.  What do you got, John?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, how are you?  We're doing all right.  We're trying to hold down the fort.  Good deal.  Oh, very interesting show you got today.  Patrice, I just wanted to let you know, hey, I love you, brother.  I think you're an awesome comedian.  You bring a lot of... 
[03:05:30]  Oh, shit.  You know what this means.  Butt.  Butt is a big butt.  I'm going to ask you a question.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm trying to be fair both sides.  I'm just always trying to be logical on either side.  That's all, man.  So before you get to cursing me out, go ahead.  No, I'm not going to curse you out.  I'm not going to curse you out.  I just want to ask you a simple question.  All right.  Do you believe that my son died for a lie?  That's a good question.  And that's good the way...  And it puts me in a weird spot, but so it doesn't be a sound bite. 
[03:06:00]  I'm going to have to come back at you.  Do you think that the reason that we went there is legitimate?  We all agree that the weapons of mass destruction thing was a lie.  So if we went there for weapons of mass destruction, yes.  If we went there to protect some type of liberty that Iraq was going to take away, no, he didn't.  So that's not a clear-cut answer to that because, first of all, your son was in it. 
[03:06:30]  He probably didn't have a choice to go.  So, you know, one of those things is difficult to get into, you know, your son dying for a lie.  It's like, why were we there for that situation and your son died?  You know what I'm saying?  And it's a weird question, and there's no answer.  I can't just be cold-blooded and go, it's a lie.  Your son died.  I'm saying, dude, if you believe that we went over there for a righteous reason, then, yeah, your son died for a righteous reason. 
[03:07:00]  If we were over there for non-righteous reasons, your son was used, like everyone else's sons and daughters, man,  to fight something that our government might be doing funky shit over there, man.  I mean, I hope I'm not offending you.  Oh, not at all, not at all.  Fair enough from what you're talking about.  Do I believe that we went in for the wrong reason at the beginning?  Absolutely. 
[03:07:30]  Do I believe the mission changed?  Oh, yes.  My son, before he was killed, he was involved in finding the mass grave that Saddam had left all over his country.  He had seen the carnage and the tyranny, the evilness that this dictator left, and he knew firsthand.  And he told me that the majority of the people that were there wanted us there.  They were coming up to them, kissing their hands, bringing them home-cooked meals, telling them, thank you for being here. 
[03:08:00]  Thank you for freeing us from Saddam.  I'm feeling you.  There's only a specific group of people over there that had everything to lose for Saddam not being in power over there.  There's people over there that were right up there in the top echelon, and then when Saddam got taken out, they were nobody.  You know what you're doing, sir?  And this is the great thing.  You boiled it down to the best way you can boil it down, which is a human level, that your son as a human being thought he was doing some good stuff over there. 
[03:08:30]  And the people that appreciated America being over there for human reasons, to help get underneath a shitty dictator and a shitty situation, and your son was helping on that, that's the human level.  And when you get down to that, that's the best way to be.  So that's what I'm saying.  There's a weird, you can't soundbite that answer. 
[03:09:00]  Were we over there as a government for some right shit?  Don't know, but ended up going over there?  You know, a lot of times these countries that need food, you send food over, but the dictator takes it and fucking makes omelets with it and sells it.  But he's a fucked up guy, but the intentions, there's a saying called intent versus impact.  Whatever we intended to do is not what the ultimate thing that happened.  So ultimately, look, what we intended to do as a country, I don't know. 
[03:09:30]  But what impacted was some people and your son died for righteous reasons?  Hey, man, you know, there's a lot of answers, man.  A lot of answers and a lot of questions.  Now, I got one other part to this, and this has to do with the attack on September 11th.  And I've always wanted to ask this question.  Now I've got an opportunity to ask this in front of, what, two countries now?  How do these people, especially these freaky-ass friggin' conspiracy theorists, nuts, which, thank God, I'm glad, Anthony, you're not one of them. 
[03:10:00]  No.  Or are you?  Oh, hells.  Hells, no.  What are you, kidding?  Only that the Holocaust didn't exist.  Depends what gun you have on you.  And slavery was bullshit.  Depends what gun John has on him before I answer the question.  What I want to know.  You know, John's got some shit.  What I want to know is why or how could any type of explosive survive the intense fire when the falling of the towers happened at the point of impact, 
[03:10:30]  where the temperature was, what, 1,800 degrees, if not higher?  Yeah.  About right.  There's no explosives that can survive that, as far as I'm aware.  Shit, that pitch I just saw, again, actually, I was like, well, it did kind of fall.  It fell right after impact.  It's like, you know, believe half of what you see, baby.  You know, it did look like it to me.  Let's remember the fire.  How long did it take for the towers to fall after the impact? 
[03:11:00]  What, about 45 minutes?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's remember, the beams just had to be weakened, too.  They didn't have to melt.  No, absolutely.  You just had to be heated up, and then they lose their structural integrity, and then they can warp and bend.  Exactly.  And that's all it takes.  Exactly.  Especially with the radical design that these towers had.  It was a dumb design.  Absolutely, it was.  It was a major flaw.  It was.  Well, who knew that was going to happen?  Jesus.  Let's go.  All right, John.  All right, man.  Always a pleasure, sir.  John in Connecticut.  All right, Jesse Ventura down at the crime scene. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yes.  He's down at Ground Zero.  Looking for answers.  Jesse makes his way closer to the scene of the crime.  He's hoping to get into the Ground Zero site, maybe find some remnants of the original steel that he can bring back for testing.  What is he talking about?  What?  Ant knows.  If you live in New York, everyone knows.  That stuff is long gone.  They went through that with fucking, like, beach sieves.  Right.  To make sure there wasn't anything. 
[03:12:00]  They built, like, battleships or something out of that.  Yeah.  It's long gone.  I mean.  It was in fresh kills, and then it's a...  A brand new building should be in its place by now, but with that said, it's a completely different place.  Why the fuck isn't something...  Why aren't we building a building yet?  What's going on?  Tape shit.  That should take another half hour to explain.  Oh, really?  You can walk in there, and they'll tell you to shut this off.  Yeah.  But the police guard won't let him closer than a view of the new Freedom Tower, built to withstand impacts from above and below.  The new buildings would withstand the heat from jet fuel or super thermite, but the original steel, it was long gone. 
[03:12:30]  Most of it shipped out and recycled.  This crime scene had been destroyed a long time ago.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  I can't do this.  Crime scene has been destroyed.  I can't do this.  And who's saying...  It's called clean up.  What, were you supposed to leave everything in fucking downtown Manhattan?  And who's saying that the new building will survive that?  Who's saying that?  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  I'll tell you why, Jesse, people think he's a douche on this.  And just because of that soundbite, no one likes a motherfucker who makes his points poignantly where he thinks that this will get you.  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, he took the steel, and it's gone.  And he should always end up going, hmm?  Hold on.  He does, too.  How about that, motherfuckers?  If he didn't know any better, you would assume this is old audio, and Jesse was down there September 12th.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:13:30]  September 13th, September 14th of 2001.  It's eight years later.  I'm looking for evidence.  Sorry, Jesse, that we didn't wait for you to come down eight years later to investigate, by the way.  Where were you a week after this thing?  That's when you should have tried to get in there.  I hate this guy now.  I'm looking for evidence down at the scene of the crime.  Maybe I could take a piece of metal back for testing.  And they're not letting you in, because guess what? 
[03:14:00]  Guys are working.  Yeah.  They don't want...  They don't want people milling around.  Yeah, yeah.  At this point, they got a job to do.  To bring money home to their families.  What a tool.  What really happened on 9-11?  Oh.  Jesse's going to tell us.  The end result is this.  The government knowingly destroyed all the evidence.  And you think that's because they're covering it up?  Why else?  Give me an example of why they would change basic police investigation. 
[03:14:30]  The logic is that people didn't want to have to look at that eyesore to remind themselves of what happened on that day.  I'll give that to you.  But then why did it all have to be destroyed?  Couldn't they have removed it and taken it to another spot so that then it could be investigated?  No.  The main focus going on that day was to get rid of every shred of evidence, melt it down, build Navy ships out of it, ship it off to China.  Now, anything they could do with the remains out there, they did it. 
[03:15:00]  It would have taken a mere two to three hours to check for demolition.  And he was a governor, huh?  Two to three hours to check for demolition.  Well, maybe in two to three hours, you know, they were busy maybe looking for survivors.  And then as far as getting rid of the evidence, it was called cleaning up the bottom of Manhattan, you dummy.  And a lot of that steel sat, where was it again?  Fresh killed.  Fresh killed.  For years.  And then finally someone came along and said, you know what?  We've got to do something with this shit.  Scrap it.  Do something with this shit. 
[03:15:30]  So let's make a ship out of it.  There's some over there at Kennedy Airport, like he said, in Hangar, the mysterious Hangar 17.  There's some great instant feedback coming in.  Maurice Jones from Pittsburgh.  He writes, did that asshole Anthony say ew about the home-cooked meals?  And then he writes, I was thinking the same thing.  Iraqi meatloaf is probably gross.  Wow.  I didn't think he heard that.  Yes, I did say ew when the guys said that.  And George and Philly's right.  Come on, guys.  Everyone knows you don't clear a crime scene for at least 10 years.  And then Eric in Virginia Tech writes, oh, were they supposed to leave everything as is where it was because a wrestler hadn't looked at it yet? 
[03:16:00]  A wrestler hadn't looked at it yet.  That's what it is.  And Redding from Whackbag.  Wow.  And you guys gave dice shit for being there a month after 9-11.  By the way, please play Quantum Dice.  Can we play Quantum Dice today?  Quantum Dice.  It might make sense today.  And it goes on and on.  All right, let's, we're running out of time.  Yeah, I want to hear some more.  No, here's the narrator.  Jesse is in stealth mode. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, is he?  Well, a lot of the evidence from 9-11 is stored at a hangar at JFK, hangar 17.  We asked permission to go in, and they wouldn't let us in even without our cameras.  And they wonder why there's conspiracy theories.  Let's get on this one, people.  Now, Jesse is in stealth mode at John F. Kennedy Airport.  Got to hang with dice.  This is where much of the remaining evidence from Ground Zero is stored.  That evidence could hold many answers. 
[03:17:00]  Can it?  Really?  Can it hold many answers?  And when he's in JFK, is the music going, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Yeah, where he's like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  No, the ding, ding, ding, ding.  What's the one Fred Flintstone on his tippy toes?  Do I still have that?  We used to play it.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. 
[03:17:30]  This is some cartoon shit, so we need some cartoon sound effects.  But Fred Flintstone, when he was being stealth, he would get on his tippy toes and crawl, you know.  We got the sound somewhere.  Is it in mine?  He is the worst.  Yeah.  There he is.  All right, let me look over here.  No, this door's locked. 
[03:18:00]  Amazing that a door would be locked here at an airport.  Wait, what's that?  Your camera crew, follow me.  What an asshole.  Well, here's the clip of him peeping in windows.  Or doors?  Whatever.  Yeah, it's a door with a window in.  Okay, all right, that makes sense, sure.  This is the infamous Hangar 17.  This is a place where we've contacted on multiple, multiple occasions to go inside and see what they have inside this building. 
[03:18:30]  Because there are remnants from September the 11th in there.  And I gotta stop you, because I don't want to lose this one.  Who's your daddy 44 on Twitter?  Oh, there's a piece of a beam from 9-11 on display.  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  Are you ready for this?  Yeah.  It's gonna blow everyone away here.  At a truck stop in Nebraska.  There you go. 
[03:19:00]  Why not just go to the truck stop in Nebraska?  With a plaque and everything that says, this came from.  Why not just go to the truck stop in Nebraska, Jesse?  There's an actual beam at a truck stop in Nebraska.  And check it for...  That's breaking news right there.  Inside this building, because there are remnants from September the 11th in there.  This is what they don't want me to see. 
[03:19:30]  We've tried to get in this building.  We can't even get in it now.  The door's locked.  And you can see girders, obviously, from the 9-11 site.  Were they tested for super thermite?  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  Look at all that dust.  That's where they find it.  Why won't they give us access to this building?  Because you're...  Because it's a fucking building on an airport. 
[03:20:00]  Honestly, probably because he didn't ask.  Yeah.  And if they want to hide it so much, how come he could walk up to the window in the door...  Right.  ...and it's sitting right there when you look in the window?  Wouldn't he just...  Like a good drug dealer just black out the window?  Yeah.  Yeah, like black out the window, put something over it.  David Patrice is done.  Look at Patrice.  He's done.  He can't even argue anymore.  They left nothing.  They weren't hiding anything. 
[03:20:30]  This is what they don't want me to see.  What's right behind this very open window.  This shut down Patrice.  Look at him.  He's done.  It's because Jesse's approach is horrendous.  His approach is...  That's why I wanted to get to these clips.  They're just amazing.  His approach is...  On how bad it is.  I have George the Animal Steal looking in another window.  Moo!  Yes, George!  George, go...  Rip the...  There's a piece of turnbuckle that's between the door and the dust. 
[03:21:00]  Moo!  Rip the knob off with your teeth like you did the turnbuckle.  George!  George, you see that guard over there?  Hit him in the neck with a foreign object spoon that you have hidden in your shorts.  What we need to get through this door is the Polish hammer.  Where's Ivan Putzky and his Polish hammer?  The wrestler's gone!  Then I'm going to get Mr. Fuji to throw salt in the guy's eyes.  Oh, King Fuji?  So it'll blind him.  We can then test for thermite.  Super thermite.  Where's... 
[03:21:30]  Moondog spot!  I need you to go over there.  Go throw your bone down for that fat woman to go.  Where's Hacksaw, Jim Dawkins?  We can use that 2x4 by now.  Here's what we're going to do, Hacksaw.  We want you to steal the beam and have you replace it with your 2x4 so they know nothing's missing.  Where's Earthquake?  He'll run through this door.  Shut up, George.  Brr!  Brr! 
[03:22:00]  Brr!  What an idiot.  Oh, my God.  I'm going over there.  Fucking idiot.  You're such an idiot.  And throw salt in his eyes, Mr. Fuji.  All right, here's what we need.  Jimmy Superfly Snooker has to jump through the ductwork on the roof.  Ah, Mr. Fuji, go throw thermite in his eyes. 
[03:22:30]  Throw thermite in his eyes.  What was that that Mr. Fuji was throwing?  Oh, God.  I don't think it was salt.  Scott S. from Quaker Town.  Chief J. Strongbow, put a sleeper hold on the security guard.  This is what they don't want us to see.  It would make a great cartoon, Jesse and his fellow wrestlers.  Wrestlers are all going at it.  Just trying to find conspiracies.  Ben Tor, here's Steven S. from Bayshore. 
[03:23:00]  If Andre the Giant was here, God rest his soul, we'd simply be able to look over the wall.  Was Andre killed in a preemptive strike?  Think about it.  Conspiracies.  Somebody flew a plane into Andre.  You could hear explosions in his shoes before he fell down.  This fucking guy, you gotta write your name if you're instant feedback. 
[03:23:30]  They painted Owen Hart with thermite paint.  Oh, shit.  All right, you know.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, that's terrible, right?  You gotta...  God, man.  Hold on.  What the fuck?  That's just a fucking shame.  There's two...  All right.  Uh, Redding.  We had Brutus the Barber Beefcake cut the locks with his giant shears.  With the shears.  Oh, shit.  And, uh, coincidence?  George the Animal Steel.  The steel they won't show us. 
[03:24:00]  We'll show you our steel.  You show us yours.  Greg Sledder.  Maybe we can rebuild him.  Greg the Hammer's hammer.  Greg from Long Island.  If I had my feather boa for my days in the ring, I could swing to the top of the building.  Yes, I'd put a grappling hook on it.  Oh, shitballs, man.  Where's the ass man?  Yeah.  He could distract him with his ass.  Oh, they're coming in fast. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, I didn't know this.  Rich O from D.C.  Sergeant Slaughter is my army contact.  And he says we knew about it.  That's a good one.  We talked to Sergeant Slaughter.  Why weren't the planes scrambled on that day?  And where was the Iron Sheik?  Chris C. from Virginia.  Get Coco Beware's parrot to do some recon.  Have the Iron Sheik show this man some discipline and fuck him in the ass like he always threatens. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, my God.  They're coming in way too fucking fast.  Oh, shit.  Hey, ass man, use your ass to open the door.  He probably could.  The 9-11 explosions were funded by Ted DiBiase.  That's Jordan Slaughter.  The millionaire Ted DiBiase.  Follow the money, people. 
[03:25:30]  Follow the money trail.  Warrior, Serge.  Jesse's full of shit.  Former tag team champions.  Demolition, hello.  Who applied the thermite paint?  The ultimate warrior's face painted with thermite paint.  All he had to do was rub his face on a beam and it brought the buildings down.  Do I have to say any more? 
[03:26:00]  I can't keep up with this shit.  There was a good one.  It went flying by.  Where is it?  Andrew in Jersey.  The Undertaker's pallbearer's urn was full with thermite dust.  He just threw it.  It's the same people that blew up Vince's limousine.  And you saw how that worked out.  There was a conspiracy with Vince McMahon.  It always gets bad. 
[03:26:30]  Andrew from Belmar.  Fuck, where'd it go?  Wow, I've never seen his feedback fly by like this.  Jake the Snake will break through high on coke.  What do they call it?  Jesse Ventura and his super conspiracy busting wrestling all-stars.  Pete from Connecticut.  And then I don't have to tell you that Steve Austin's going to open a can of whoop thermite.  Cigars and scotch.  I didn't know this, Ant.  Same people that blew up Vince's limo. 
[03:27:00]  That's what I said.  Oh, you said that one?  Motherfucker.  Sorry about that.  It's all right.  We're crossing over now.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I love it.  Goddamn.  That's a funny angle.  Him and his wrestling friends.  Tipsy, Mr. T, USA.  Miss Elizabeth was murdered because she knew about super thermite.  Jesse.  Super thermite.  Hey, Jesse, one of the airport security guys just shot you.  You're bleeding.  Ain't got time to bleed.  Ain't got time to bleed. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, ain't got time to bleed.  I want to introduce a new wrestling tag team, super thermite.  That's right.  Super thermite's going to fight tonight.  And his partner, bullshit.  Chad and Phoenix, Chris Benoit, mind controlled.  Nothing left to say.  They pointed the harp system at Chris Benoit.  He didn't want to kill his family.  Oh, man. 
[03:28:00]  That's a funny angle, man.  That wrestling.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's like when the fucking Harlem Globetrotters had their own fucking show.  Didn't they have their own show or they were just part of Scooby-Doo?  The Scooby-Doo.  Think about it.  No, the Harlem Globetrotters had their own.  I think they did.  And weren't they trying to solve crimes?  They might have been.  Yeah.  King Kong climbed the Empire State Building.  We're getting King Kong Bundy to climb Hangar 17. 
[03:28:30]  Dummy.  He is just a dummy.  Are there any more clips in here?  Junkyard dogs.  That's selfish.  I got one.  I got one.  With his chains around his neck.  Could someone get China's clit?  I think we could use it to open this lock.  We could jimmy the door with her clit.  Giant clitoris.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:29:00]  Jesse explains the government's 9-11 involvement.  The only way this works is if it's an inside job.  Isn't that what we're investigating here, Alex?  Do I believe that the government would set out to kill over 3,000 of its own citizens  and bring down some of its most iconic landmarks?  No, I don't.  You're telling me that you do?  I don't necessarily believe the government did it.  But I will tell you who I think might have.  How many people here know what a false flag operation is?  You have any idea? 
[03:29:30]  Okay, what it is, basically, it's a lie.  It's a deception that the government does in which to get the public to believe something  so that they can carry out an agenda.  Like Rowdy Roddy and They Live.  That was a black flag operation.  And finally, he wraps it all up.  Recaps his findings.  Every government official we talk to refers us back to the 9-11 report.  Well, I've read the 9-11 report, and there's nothing in it that talks about the explosion 
[03:30:00]  below that William Rodriguez told us about.  There's nothing in the 9-11 report that talks about the thermite.  I mean, it's thermite.  Shut up, we got thermite.  Chris asked from Shirley, bravo.  The Brooklyn brawler saw the whole thing go down from his apartment.  Sorry.  I just don't want to lose these before they play.  The Brooklyn brawler. 
[03:30:30]  There's nothing in the 9-11 report that talks about the thermite discovered in the dust that  Professor Jones told us about.  And it certainly doesn't explain why our air defense was in a stand-down mode while all  hell was breaking loose in our airspace.  And finally, where are the eyewitness testimonies?  People like Mike Ballone, who swear they found the black boxes at Ground Zero.  And where are those black boxes now?  Are they being hidden because they might tell us that the hijackers were in the cockpit of 
[03:31:00]  American Airlines before it even took off?  These are the facts as we found.  Why would they do that?  What the fuck?  If they were fully aware, wouldn't they just shut their fucking...  They were in the cockpit before the plane took off.  Actually, months before.  They had been flying overnights from New York...  Flying the red eye from New York to L.A. 
[03:31:30]  Jesus.  Airlines before it even took off.  Very informative.  They pointed out the Grand Canyon to me.  Holy shit.  And the Hoover Dam.  Before it even took off.  These are the facts as we found them.  But I'm more convinced than ever that the real story of 9-11 is lying in some government  vault somewhere.  I'm Jesse Ventura.  And this is conspiracy theory.  In some government vault, along with the Ark of the Covenant, in a big wooden box with 
[03:32:00]  Nazi symbols burnt off.  Oh, that's fucking funny.  Don't look at the beam.  Don't look at the beam.  Turn your head.  Dummy.  Hey, Rick.  Nah, I don't feel funny.  I was going to do a Ric Flair woo joke.  Woo!  Strike that with a woo.  I was going to go.  Uh, I just got tired. 
[03:32:30]  I just literally got tired.  That fucking guy is...  There we go.  The Nazis' head melting because he looked at the fucking beam.  He burnt by thermite.  Yeah, I was going to...  Yeah.  See, what happened was the Nazis got too close to the thermite that was in the Ark of the  Covenant.  But Indy turned away.  Now, why did Indy live through that?  The Iron Sheik's going to make Jesse humble and then urinate on the guards. 
[03:33:00]  That's Andrew in Baltimore.  The great god Thermopolis is what...  Thermopolis.  That's what Bergen's face.  Thermite paint.  And there's too many coming in, but people from all over the country saying there's a little  piece of the Twin Towers in my city, there's one in Albany, there's one here.  It's...  It's...  I can't get to all of them.  I'm here with Pergams.  There's Pergams all over the place.  Looking for Thermite paint.  Do you have it in a gloss?  Are there even Pergams anymore? 
[03:33:30]  I'm here at Home Depot.  I'm at Lowe's.  Look, I need something in a semi-gloss eggshell.  No, do you have it in Thermite?  Explosive Super Thermite.  Why are you removing me from the store?  Jason asks from Rockland County, we're going to have a ladder match to reach the keys to  the government vault.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[03:34:00]  You think it might have been steroids that got Jesse a little weird in his later years?  I have no fucking idea.  I have no idea if he ever did steroids, but the two video clips we saw, his arms were very,  very different.  Extremely different.  I don't know.  I don't know what to make of him.  I don't know either.  But you know something?  Next week...  What's next week?  Watching that stupid show again.  What's next week?  This is our new bit.  What is next week's subject?  Because we get all the fucking wrestlers involved.  Is it Manchurian candidates?  Do we know? 
[03:34:30]  Next week.  What is it?  Bigfoot?  My hair, where did it go?  Why do I have a rat tail?  Top Gunt from Canada.  I did not know this.  Hacksaw, Jim Duggan, actually carries around a beam from the towers now.  Why didn't he just go to Jesse and have it tested?  He updated his look.  It's now just a beam.  Now there's Dusty Rhodes.  I like to check the dust on him.  Is that explosive remnants?  It's Fermite Dusty Rhodes. 
[03:35:00]  Fermite Rhodes.  They should check the lumps on his body.  See what he's hiding.  I know what's going on there.  See what he's hiding.  I'm sure it's explosive.  What's next week's?  We don't know what next week's is.  Gotta, come on.  You saw the show.  What was the coming preview?  You think I remembered?  I fucking tuned that out of my head in a second.  I don't know.  That piss is coming out of my eyeballs.  I gotta take a leak.  We got reads to do, too.  Yeah, figure it out yourselves, motherfuckers.  Yeah, we'll figure it out. 
[03:35:30]  We'll do another one of these next week.  Of course we will.  Big Mama Prods, thank you.  Are we done?  Why not?  But it seems like a good place to end it, right?  Well, thank you for having me.  Patrice O'Neill, everyone.  Absolutely, Patrice.  You're still lonely.  I'm coming back tomorrow.  Thank you, my friend.  You're welcome.  You're more than welcome.  Is that okay?  Absolutely.  We got some lawman shit to do.  I'm lonely.  Yeah.  Oh, what is it?  What is it?  Global warming.  Oh, wow.  Imagine the wrestlers trying to figure out the global warming thing.  Global warming, earthquake, and typhoon.  Typhoon. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, this is perfect.  Start working on your lines for next week, boys.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. </pre>
