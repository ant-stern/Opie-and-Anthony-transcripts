<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their characteristic self-deprecating and controversial banter.  They initially joked about a Black doorman, before transitioning to Anthony's solo segment on "racism and guns."  A lengthy discussion about *Happy Days*, comparing its earlier and later seasons, followed. Anthony shared childhood home movie anecdotes, which led to conversations about his father's alcoholism, his own hangovers, and a brief, uncomfortable discussion about potentially repressed memories of childhood abuse.  A heated argument erupted between Anthony and Jim Norton regarding a movie project, escalating into insults and name-calling.  Anthony detailed his recent excessive food consumption (tacos and KFC), contrasting it with Norton's description of his eating habits. Rich Vos joined the conversation, contributing to the banter with jokes about his dating life and the perceived advantages of being associated with the Opie and Anthony Show.

A substantial segment focused on a heated debate about Israel potentially attacking Iran, with Anthony expressing support for the attack, regardless of US involvement. This discussion was filled with geopolitical analysis and heated exchanges, frequently punctuated by racial and ethnic slurs and stereotypes from the hosts.  The conversation touched upon historical events, the role of the media, and the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The show then shifted to a birthday discussion for E-Rock, a staff member, focusing on the negativity associated with aging and birthdays, followed by more rambling conversation and insults, including further use of offensive language and racial slurs.

A later segment featured comedian Joe DeRosa. The conversation began with a humorous anecdote about a cruise ship meal, contrasting it with the less desirable conditions below deck. DeRosa recounted a disastrous date with a woman he called a "fucking lunatic bitch," sparking a discussion about "guy code" and the consequences of revealing personal details.  This led to tangents about DeRosa's indiscretions (revealing details of a strip club visit and a bad date on podcasts), a contentious debate about credit for a movie project, and their reactions to the Academy Awards, focusing on perceived racial biases.  They discussed social media, technology's potential for government control (stemming from DeRosa's telecommunications history course), alcohol consumption, and a Twitter follower who only displayed pictures of her breasts.  The segment was characterized by crude language, frequent interruptions, and rapid topic shifts, with humor stemming from the hosts' interactions and DeRosa's anecdotes.

A subsequent segment played audio clips from DeRosa's podcast, detailing a disastrous date with Kathy.  The clips revealed a heated argument about Joe's attire (a blazer Kathy insisted was a suit), her perceived entitlement regarding expenses, and a physical altercation over his phone. Kathy's age (44) became a point of contention.  The segment ended with discussion of Kathy's upcoming date with Dan Soder and a plan to have Joe skip out on a future dinner bill.  This was followed by Anthony taking calls where listeners left "fuck you" messages, then Anthony's solo segment on guns, with callers discussing firearms and accessories.

Another segment began with a discussion about gun ownership and then shifted to the recent death of Andrew Breitbart, with a caller sharing positive memories of him and criticizing liberals for celebrating his death. This led to a broader discussion about the lack of outspoken political figures, the current political climate, perceived apathy and fear, the influence of money in politics, and limitations on freedom of speech.  The hosts expressed frustration with the system, using analogies from various aspects of life, and concluded with a pessimistic outlook on the possibility of significant change.  Vulgar language and offensive terms were frequently used.

The final segment involved discussions of financial struggles in the entertainment industry, with DeRosa and Rich Vos (who was also present) recounting their experiences and frustrations. DeRosa announced a Southeast tour.  They discussed health insurance costs and retirement anxieties, with frequent good-natured bickering and insults exchanged between DeRosa and Voss (including DeRosa throwing Voss' glasses).  Birthday wishes for Eric (E-Rock) were offered, followed by plugs for the hosts' and DeRosa's projects.  The show concluded with listener calls, reminiscing about past interns (Paul and Evan),  more plugs, and a short comedic skit about Anthony.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts frequently used vulgar language, racial slurs, and ethnic slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better, yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show's on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Friday morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  That's the black guy in the lobby every fucking morning.  He says welcome aboard?  Welcome aboard.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Friday morning.  That's the big one. 
[00:01:30]  Friday morning.  So I look forward to Fridays.  Not because it's, you know, the weekend.  And, you know, you're going to have fun.  And Fridays.  Everyone loves Fridays.  Just because he wishes me a good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Friday morning.  Oh, man.  I never met that guy until today.  Oh, he's great.  He's the best.  He just makes you feel good.  It's like oldie time black person.  It's like, come on.  Like, get the door, tip your hat kind of a guy.  Jesus Christ.  I love it.  Oh, yeah.  It's just minutes in. 
[00:02:00]  My fucking show today.  It's the Anthony Show.  My fucking show.  We're going to talk about racism and guns.  Racism and guns are my fucking show.  It's the Anthony fucking show.  So don't even bother trying to call in, motherfuckers.  Because Anthony don't take no fucking phone calls.  Your theme song, when you host alone, it should just be the theme song from Happy Days.  Yes.  Just a 1950s mentality.  50s, feeling good.  That's right, people.  That's right.  What was that theme song? 
[00:02:30]  How did that go?  Well, there were two of them.  There was one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock.  There was that one.  And there was Monday, happy days.  That one.  Tuesday, Thursday, Thursday, Friday, happy days, the weekend comes.  I don't like this one because it reminds me of the shitty episodes, the later ones.  I thought this was the first theme song.  No, the early ones were just one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock.  It was rock around the clock.  Okay. 
[00:03:00]  It had nothing to do with happy days.  They just took rock around the clock.  One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock, rock.  This is it.  And it said, you know, Fonzie didn't even get a fucking credit at the beginning.  Really?  No.  It was like he was co-starring.  E-Rock.  He was wearing the gray jacket.  He didn't have his leather jacket yet.  Yeah, he had a windbreaker on.  He didn't even have the leather.  He wasn't like, hey.  He was just like, hey, Cunningham.  What do you do?  Like, he was cool in the early ones.  He loitered outside the high school.  Yeah.  He was just like, eh, I'm not into that, you know, school thing. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  And then he just turned into this over-the-top dummy-ass fucking character.  But early on, it was this song.  It was done on film with a laugh track instead of that video in front of a live audience  where Richie would walk in and you'd have 30 seconds of, woo!  Woo!  Right.  Right.  You know, it was done on film.  They had outdoor locations.  It wasn't just the Cunningham House and Arnold's.  Right.  You know, it was done very well, the early ones.  Because it was sort of that American graffiti feel to it. 
[00:04:00]  I particularly, well, it was based on American graffiti, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, uh...  And an episode of Love American Style, Love and the Happy Days.  Really?  Yeah, that was like one of the first kind of almost like the pilot episode.  I didn't know that.  Yes.  I didn't know that.  I know everything about oldie-time television.  You're just an oldie-time kind of guy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, based on some of the home movies I've put up on YouTube lately.  Right.  I found a whole bunch of home movies.  Yeah.  I was looking at them last night. 
[00:04:30]  I realize how ancient I really am.  They're silent, first of all.  There wasn't even sound.  We were fine with taking movies with no fucking sound.  Right.  And it was cool.  It was like, you didn't go like, wow, I wish we had sound on that.  You just accepted that there wasn't going to be sound.  Yeah, and it's like, you're like, back then it's like your Christmas movies ended up looking  like some snuff evidence film in a courtroom.  It really is, yeah.  It's like creepy when there's no sound.  It's the Zabruder film. 
[00:05:00]  But with, you know, little kids playing instruments and whatnot.  It just looks like something terrible is about to happen.  Oh, I know.  It also looks like old History Channel footage of two kids in a concentration camp.  Ah, yes.  The children in pink pajamas documentary.  You know?  I just need a Star of David fucking sewn on my little Christmas outfit.  So this is the beginnings of your band here.  Yeah, that's the first Rot Gut video right there. 
[00:05:30]  Me and my brother Joe on Christmas morning playing our little instruments.  I could only imagine, because knowing my dad, boy, that man liked to drink, you know.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  And the fucking, the whiskey bottle doesn't fall far from the bar, because I like to drink  too.  And I could only imagine me smashing those hi-hat cymbals, and my brother playing that fucking  guitar, and me crying, and his hangover. 
[00:06:00]  That must have been a horror nightmare for my father.  Well, maybe he was just shit-faced when you were doing it.  Maybe he was still drunk.  Yeah, and he was like, fuck it, you know, whatever, man.  I mean, that's the only way to get through that.  You couldn't, if he wasn't going, shut the fuck up, then he was probably kind of half cocked.  Kind of half, yeah, probably half snotted still.  But, you know, he had the good sense to pick up a camera, though.  A lot of people back then didn't even have movie cameras and stuff. 
[00:06:30]  That's nice.  Yeah.  I also think, you know, look, along with every other way that men were more of real  men back then, I think they maybe just dealt with their hangover, and was like, this is  the fucking price you pay.  You get a headache, you chew some aspirin, you just chew it.  You don't even take it.  You just chew it.  I do remember hearing the crunch of aspirin back then.  I can't even, if I don't get it down fast enough with water, that bitter taste kills me.  And they were just chewing down old, like, 1960s aspirin, which I'm sure is really raw. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I was just watching that movie, The Rum Diary.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see that on demand.  Is it pretty good?  It was okay.  I really liked the other two Hunter Thompson movies.  I love Fear and Loathing.  Fear and Loathing's good.  Fear, where the buffalo roam is great.  Yeah.  And even though this isn't a movie about Hunter Thompson, it's, you know, it's, I guess,  a somewhat autobiographical novel that he wrote in some way. 
[00:07:30]  So it sort of does serve as, it feels like a prequel to all of it before all the craziness  in the second two movies happens, you know?  And Johnny Depp, throughout the movie, gets a little more and more Hunter Thompson-y, but  it never crosses over.  You're just, you just want that scene where he thinks there's fucking bats flying around  him and it never really comes.  Yeah.  But it's good.  It's good.  Anyway, in the beginning, he's really fucking hung over and he just gets up and his eyes 
[00:08:00]  literally have red lines in them.  Like, and he just starts chewing bare aspirin.  And I was like jealous watching it.  I was like, I want to be that.  I want to be a man like that.  Be able to do that.  Like, I turn into a complete fucking pussy when I'm hung over.  I make noises.  I go like, oh, oh.  I moan and groan.  I have to have a cold rag on my head.  Right.  And I need a lot of water and I'm constantly on the verge of throwing up. 
[00:08:30]  It's just, it's terrible.  And then I remember growing up and my father, you know, not a pleasant guy when he was hung  over in the mornings, especially, you know, going to the room and be like, daddy, I'm  like, ah, don't bust my chops.  Leave me alone.  Right.  But he got up.  Right.  And he got out of bed and he ate his fucking eggs and shit like that.  And I'd be puking.  I don't, I don't know how, I mean, it must just come with, you know, training for lack  of a better word that you just get used to a certain lifestyle and you, and you go, you 
[00:09:00]  know, Hey, I'm the kind of drunk that has to get up at 8 a.m.  And that's just the way it is.  But like, I don't know how people do that.  I have friends that work in the industry that like, that have desk jobs and office job.  And it's like, they'll fucking drink with me until 4 a.m.  and go home and then wake up at 8 and go work 12 hours.  And I literally, I'm like, well, thank God all I have to do tomorrow is get a bucket of  KFC because that's, you know what I mean?  Why can't they deliver this fucking shit? 
[00:09:30]  You don't even want to go out for it.  Fuck.  I don't know how people do it, man, but I guess it's just training.  You just get, you know?  I put up some more videos.  I got another Christmas video up there, not just the one of me and Joe playing instruments.  It's me and Joe going to bed on Christmas evening.  And if you notice, we go to bed, we lay down, and then two seconds later, we jump up and 
[00:10:00]  open our eyes.  This is because my father knew he was going to be too hungover to actually be up when  we got up for Christmas morning.  Oh, my God.  So he, in the, he was ahead of his time.  It's assisted reality.  Right.  He staged us waking up Christmas morning so it would be on film.  Oh, that's hilarious.  So we're sitting there, and there we go.  Two seconds later, we just jump up, and yeah, I look like I'm fucking heavily sedated all  the time and on the verge of tears.  I was a little retarded kid, and Rich Voss just stepping in. 
[00:10:30]  Voss!  And I just know that my father was like, he could, he was going to be so hungover, he  wasn't going to be able to deal with us Christmas morning, so he staged us waking up Christmas  morning.  Those were our little home movies, Rich.  Jesus, dude.  Yeah.  He raped you.  Well, no, not quite.  Not that time.  Maybe his friends did.  I don't know.  I'm always wondering if, I'm always wondering if I, I'm, I'm not remembering something.  Like all this shit you read about. 
[00:11:00]  Yesterday.  That's the booze, though.  You know, with everything that pops up in the news, and you hear about these shrinks talking  about stuff, it's not that there's any inkling of abuse or any fucking post-traumatic stress  from something that happened, but you always, you start wondering when you hear about people  that just didn't remember horrible shit that happened to them.  It's like, is there something I'm not remembering?  I think that was my luster.  Do you think you were? 
[00:11:30]  Well, yeah, because I remember my mom holding me naked in the air like that.  What?  You know.  But as a baby, then.  She's pretty strong to hold a 14-year-old naked up in the air like that.  Okay, now that, now that could be.  Was that a bit?  Did you just do a bit?  No, I just thought of that.  That was good.  It was sort of like that.  Can you sit up straight?  Oh, you are.  Go ahead.  Do you know, in our movie, Sarah.  Ah, there it is.  Well, that was fast.  Immediately.  That was fast. 
[00:12:00]  Immediately.  Because I'm saying about Sarah.  Because I have to bring up.  So you name dropped and plugged in one sentence.  And bashed you, Joe.  First of all, Joe, listen to me.  Before we go on today, okay?  You are under me.  The last time we worked together, I put you on my show.  And don't forget it.  Now, let me, and don't ever, because there's never a show that you could put me on, because  one, you won't have a show, and two, you won't be able to follow me.  I couldn't.  Okay, shut up.  But let me just say this respectfully.  Let me say this respectfully. 
[00:12:30]  You're right.  I couldn't.  You're absolutely right.  I couldn't put you on a show.  I could just put you in my movie.  But, uh.  No.  No.  No.  Our movie, our movie, Bobby, before I get yelled at for saying my movie.  Okay.  Our movie, Bobby and Bill.  Your movie was a short clip.  Okay.  It was a YouTube video.  Shut up, your fucking movie.  It was seven minutes.  How many H's did you just put in shut?  So, here's the deal.  Yeah.  We were talking about molestation.  That's the only way I could bring it up, because it was Sarah. 
[00:13:00]  And she was so fucking funny when she said this.  She said, I was never molested as a kid, you know, that I could think of, you know.  And then she says, you know why?  I was too unapproachable.  As a child.  As a child.  Like, she said in such a sexy fucking hot way.  So, you're saying it's the delivery that's really the funny part.  The delivery that's missing right now.  Yes, right.  Why is your stomach bigger than your chest? 
[00:13:30]  Because I'm a fat loser.  Let me tell you what I ate for the last two days.  Everything.  Bobby.  Oh, let me tell you where depression took me these last two days.  I had both days off.  Thursday, Wednesday, I got up.  I ordered a couple breakfast sandwiches.  And they gave me an...  I ordered one sandwich.  They gave me an extra one.  I ate both of those.  Was that a favor?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[00:14:00]  Jesus.  They're like...  Fucking killing me.  I think they're starting to learn.  It's for 5G.  He gave me a fat shit, an extra sandwich.  Here he comes.  We know he's too sick to get out of bed.  So, two sandwiches.  I ate both of those.  And then I went out and bought a family taco kit.  I went to make tacos.  Was it an adopted family kit?  Oh, shit.  All of them.  I ate all of them.  You ate all of them.  All 12.  And by the time I was eating the 11th taco, I was like, I'm just drinking right now. 
[00:14:30]  You didn't eat 11 tacos.  This is all I'm doing is drinking with tacos.  You ate 11 tacos.  I ate 12 tacos.  No fucking way.  I spaced them out a little bit because I got class.  What do you mean?  One in the living room, one in the kitchen.  I ain't a fucking pig.  Here's the thing with Joe.  We've gone out to eat.  And the problem, it's little things like he'll take a sandwich where you could easily put mustard on it.  And he'll put pounds of mayonnaise on it.  You know, I mean, so much fucking mayonnaise that, you know, his heart should just fucking stop as he eats. 
[00:15:00]  We went out for burgers one night.  We had turkey burgers, which is semi, a little more healthy.  But even when you go out, it's cooked on the greasy fucking grill.  It's fucking grilled on the grease thing.  The fucking Jamoak has fucking burgers with mayonnaise.  He puts fucking a layer of depression on it.  Just every fucking thing.  I mean, I am not eating with you.  You know.  So, you know.  He's still at the age where you can do that shit, though.  Yeah, I guess he is.  As long as he stops at some point. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  That's his fucking expiration date.  Because you like the guy, and somehow he gets pussy.  I don't know.  Somehow he gets pussy.  Jesus, Rich.  Can you blow up a guy's spot on the fucking radio?  It's a personality, Rich.  I'm fucking helping you out.  I'm saying you do good.  It's called a personality.  That doesn't help me.  What?  When I'm talking to a girl and she goes, I heard you on O&A.  Vos goes, you get pussy.  Here's the wrong deal.  And you want to put that thing in me now?  You just said you heard a girl heard you on O&A. 
[00:16:00]  Well, if she did, you don't want to fuck her.  Okay?  That's one.  All right.  Let me rephrase the sentence.  I'm trying to bang that guy from Sea Caucus.  And he goes, I heard you on O&A.  I heard you're a whore.  No, I didn't say he's a whore.  I'm just saying throughout life he has girlfriends.  He's not a player where he's picking them up and fucking them, but he has girlfriends.  What is he, the elephant man?  You're talking about him like he fucking couldn't get any girls.  No, I said he gets girls.  Personality.  I said personality goes a long way. 
[00:16:30]  No, it does.  What's that from?  Pulp fiction.  That's right.  Well, that DeRosa, that better be one charming motherfucking DeRosa.  Charming motherfucking DeRosa.  And he's smart.  Yeah.  He's smart.  He's funny.  He has a future.  Not in common.  He has directing or something.  Oh.  Not in common.  Because let me tell you something.  This guy's been fired more than Steve Howe.  It's un-fucking-believable.  New reference there. 
[00:17:00]  I hired him just not to fire him.  Oh, are you kidding me?  Clubs go, look, we got to talk to you on Friday.  And then Saturday you see him at the airport.  You're making this up.  Just right.  He's just making shit up.  Listen, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Don't use my fucking slogan.  Here's the thing.  I didn't say it like that.  Here it is.  I wasn't done with the food thing, Rich.  Yesterday.  Oh.  Yesterday.  So I get up yesterday. 
[00:17:30]  I'm like, dude, I can't.  I got it.  That was crazy.  That was way out of fucking control yesterday with all the tacos.  Twelve.  I got to get this in control.  So I get up.  I go, I'm going to eat some breakfast.  Breakfast with some leftover taco meat.  I'm not going to lie.  Oh, shit.  I go, I got to get out of the house.  I got to get out of the house.  So I go to the Apple store.  I walk all the way over.  I'm just trying to be out, like breathe or whatever.  I'm walking home.  I see the KFC.  I'm like, motherfucker.  Oh, no. 
[00:18:00]  Come on, man.  I go in.  I go up to the counter.  And I live in basically Midtown.  So the KFC is really like way retarded overpriced.  So I always feel guilty.  So I go in and I go.  I used to keep them out.  Oh, Jesus.  So I go in and I go, do you have any deals right now?  Deals?  Yeah.  What are you, in Bangladesh?  In the marketplace?  Dude, I haggled this.  I swear to God.  The lady goes, not really.  You haggle a KFC in Times Square in Midtown. 
[00:18:30]  Well, in my defense, the lady was from Bangladesh that worked there.  Oh, okay.  So she was used to it?  Yeah.  She's like, finally, somebody I can relate to.  Where the chickens are live when you sell them.  Yeah.  We'll give you a good price on a 12-piece bucket.  Now you have to pluck and behead the chicken.  So she goes, we don't really have any deals going on.  And I go, just any.  And she goes, how many pieces do you want?  And I go, I don't know, like eight.  Because I knew it was going to be an all-day kind of affair. 
[00:19:00]  How much for a rib?  Yeah.  She goes, I can give you like eight pieces and two large sides for like 15 bucks.  I was like, done.  So she puts it all in the bucket.  She starts putting biscuits in.  I go, I don't eat the biscuits.  Can I have something else instead?  She goes, you want a third side?  I'm like, yes, that's exactly what I fucking want.  She gives it to me.  I took that home.  When I tell you, I mean, I was so sick from eating. 
[00:19:30]  I didn't eat all of it.  Oh, good.  At one o'clock in the morning when I was like, I have to go to bed right now because I have to wake up at five.  I was in the kitchen eating cold KFC over the sink.  Dude, come on.  You've got to be thinking about it when you're doing it.  What do you mean?  You've got to be going like this isn't good for me to do.  No, I was saying it out loud to myself.  Okay.  I was literally going, this is ridiculous.  Literally out loud.  This morning when I went in to get coffee before I left, I was barefoot. 
[00:20:00]  I stepped in something.  I go, what the fuck is that?  And it was greasy chicken crumbs that had fallen on the kitchen floor.  This is terrible.  This is terrible.  They're so dirty.  It was like finding a Coke straw on your coffee table the next morning.  Like, oh, God, I've got to stop this.  But they're so dirty.  Like, I won't eat, like I won't go into any Chinese restaurant unless it's P.O. Chang's.  And I might have talked.  Because when I was working up at a, this is a weird story. 
[00:20:30]  When I was working up in Poughkeepsie at Bananas, Franchese bought the room.  And it's run by, let's say, people that are good with computers.  So I don't want, okay.  Asian people.  No, no, no, the other ones that are also good pediatricians and doctors.  Indians?  Yeah.  All right.  So now, now I'm not saying their culture.  They come from, I think, a dirty culture.  Because one time we went to Dunkin' Donuts. 
[00:21:00]  Listen, we went to Dunkin' Donuts.  No, because when you said Bangladesh, we went to Dunkin' Donuts.  Bangladesh.  Can I just say this?  I said Bangladesh.  I love that you were, I love that you were afraid to say the word Indian.  But then as soon as somebody said it, you go, now look, they come from a dirty culture.  I'm going to tell you what happened.  Dirty culture.  I'm going to tell you what happened because it seems kind of weird.  One time we go into a Dunkin' Donuts, I'm not lying, the guy that worked behind the counter  was taking his break.  He was sitting at one of the tables with his shoes and socks off, picking his toenails.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:21:30]  I swear to God.  Come on.  You could ask, I swear to God, out in public.  Okay.  And that man's name was Russell Peters.  So then I'm at this hotel that's so fucking dirty.  Like, they don't even have a mop.  One Indian would hold the other one by his legs and do the wheelbarrow, and he would  stick his tongue out, and they would just mop the floor.  All right now, Rich.  No.  But it was very dirty.  Anyhow, so I'm trashing them on stage.  And I get home Monday, and I get an email that says, from this sports group, and I show 
[00:22:00]  you the email, we're looking for somebody to work and do this show in India, right?  For, you know, what's your price?  To go to India.  So I told them, I said, I want $25,000 with $10,000 deposit, which I never got a response.  But I don't know if those people from the hotel, I think they were trying to set me up  and kill me.  What?  For what?  No.  Why would you trash their whole culture on stage for a weekend?  They get home Monday, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, you get a, hey, would you  like to work in India? 
[00:22:30]  Maybe they thought you were funny.  Yeah, people like that kind of self-deprecation.  I don't know.  Nah, it seemed too free.  I was kind of nervous.  Maybe you just asked for an insane amount of money, and they were like, we can't afford  this, our government will collapse.  But you're not important enough for people to want to kill you.  You're just not.  Oh, yeah?  Say that to my wife.  You're right, that's true.  I am not important enough.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying you're not an important guy in some sense, in your own head, but people 
[00:23:00]  probably don't want to kill you.  It doesn't matter if you're walking the earth.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  I don't think, I really, they probably just thought you were funny, and then they were  like, 25 grand is too much money.  No, no, this was a different, this was some big sports agency in India.  I could show you the email.  But he would, you would think they would come back with a, I said, by the way, what is  an offer for a gig for me?  Do you look like, they just bill you like a chicken head?  This is very honorable. 
[00:23:30]  This is the way we let you know that we would like to have you.  We give you a chicken head and goat foot.  If you accept these gifts, you accept the deal.  You must play at Pancot Palace.  I don't want to do the gig.  You're insulting them.  Yeah.  And you're embarrassing me.  Rich is opening up for the guy they burn in the cage that they lowered into the lava.  Call him up. 
[00:24:00]  You treated them like Willie Scott, and they didn't fucking like it.  Right.  No, you would think they would come back with a counteroffer if it was legitimate, right?  That's an insult, Mac, in their country.  How the fuck do you know you ate chicken over your sink, so you think you know their country?  You fucking idiot.  I'm joking.  That was just a joke.  Jesus, Rich.  Sorry for just trying to have fun with my pal.  You fucking asshole.  Jesus Christ.  You gotta be on the defensive around here.  You never know when it's fun or if it's fucking... 
[00:24:30]  You know what, Rich?  What?  Not today, because it's the fucking Anthony show.  And today, I'd like to not just beat the shit out of each other.  Let's actually talk about things.  Go fuck yourself, Anthony.  Oh, fuck you, you hunched over fucking fat fuck, and you, you Jew, motherfucker, you fucking cocksucker, you.  We're actually gonna talk about things.  I had a question to ask you, a real legitimate one.  Well, this is exciting.  I was thinking about describing, and as a person of... 
[00:25:00]  Color?  What?  As a racist and an anti-Semite.  Ah, I'm not as much an anti-Semite as I am a racist.  No, I don't think you are.  I do like the Jews.  I do think you do.  But I am a racist.  Do you think...  Jesus Christ.  Do you personally think...  Yes.  Do you personally think Israel should attack Iran?  Yes.  Now, do you think...  I absolutely think they should.  Okay, do you think they should do it with or without the permission of this country? 
[00:25:30]  Permission, no.  They don't need our permission.  But I would love if the United States would cooperate in some way, shape, or form, either as some type of, you know, logistics.  Back up, because we got some pretty cool shit we could fly over, AWACS and whatnot, help them out.  Maybe lend them a few of our big bunker buster bombs, because these things are buried pretty deep in those Iranian mountains to get to those bunkers.  But Obama is trying to steer as clear as he can of this Israel-Iran situation. 
[00:26:00]  Here's the problem.  If we wait and wait and wait and don't do anything, and Israel waits on us, Iran will have a nuclear bomb.  They've said that they want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.  They're not a very tolerant nation.  We've seen that.  And I absolutely believe that they would use nuclear weapons at the drop of a turban. 
[00:26:30]  If they feel any type of threat, I think they would use it.  Well, okay, so say Israel does, and you know it'll feed into the total anti-Semitism in this country through hate groups and this and that.  Look at Israel.  Enough already.  Why do we fund them?  And they're doing this, because it could cause an all-out fucking world war.  You know that.  Yeah, you never know what's going to happen when Israel jumps in there.  So, okay.  Now, deep down, you know, as well as any level-headed person, Obama really does want Israel to attack Iran. 
[00:27:00]  But he just wants to save face during an election year coming up, not to make, not to send troops again back into another country.  You know what I mean?  He's on the whole campaign of, I'm pulling troops out.  I don't think he'd send troops in.  I don't think any president that's in office would send any troops in to support Israel if they decide to hit Iran. 
[00:27:30]  What if Israel hits Iran and then Lebanon is Syria?  They can handle themselves, Israel.  They wouldn't send troops in unless it was an occupation kind of thing.  That's the only time they send—you know what I mean?  I mean, like, if two countries are going at it, don't let them go at it.  If they fly some planes over and—  But what if three countries go after—  They have no fucking unity in that area as far as—even against Israel.  I don't think they can just come up with a plan to unite and beat up on Israel. 
[00:28:00]  It's one willy-nilly country after another, and Israel's pretty good at taking care of themselves.  I think, again, logistic support and hardware is one thing.  I don't think we'd have to send any troops over there, to be honest with you.  I absolutely think they should strike Iran before they really get out of control, to tell you the truth.  But why doesn't England—why does it have to be Israel?  Why doesn't anybody else do it?  Because Israel's the one that's in there, and they're the one that's most threatened. 
[00:28:30]  And I think if Iran decided to use any type of military force against England, they'd know there'd be a lot of shit going on.  Israel, I think they could get away with.  It's sad to say, but I think they could actually poke their nose into Israel and not get as much flack from the rest of the world as they would if they bombed England.  Yeah, but here's—see, when Lebanon was, you know, shooting, what, Scud missiles or whatever missiles into Israel on a daily basis, just dropped— 
[00:29:00]  Like little rocket attacks that they would do.  But the fact is, that would never happen if, say, fucking Connecticut was sending those missiles into New York.  Don't you think New York would have the right to retaliate, right?  It depends on where in New York they're hitting.  That's true.  If it's fucking, you know, Scarsdale, there's a problem.  If it's the Bronx, not so much.  But how come—now, when Israel retaliated against Lebanon, Israel's the bad guy. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, but Israel's always going to be the bad guy in that part of the world.  They decided to settle down in the middle of a fucking bunch of people that hate them, Rich.  I'm talking—that's where—  They should have fucking puckered down in Asia somewhere.  That's where the fucking UN sent them.  They didn't settle there.  That's where the UN declared, this is their state.  That's where they sent them after World War II.  That's how we keep you guys under control.  We'll keep you surrounded.  We don't know how dastardly and sly you guys can be.  That's true.  That's true. 
[00:30:00]  But when you're laying in the hospital bed and you're looking up, you better praise the fucking Jew.  Indian.  Okay.  Those dirty from their dirty cultures.  When you're in fucking court ready to face 10 to 15, you better pray a Jew is your defense attorney.  Oh, yeah, because he did so well on my fucking divorce case.  Divorce, you fucking idiot.  No, you got to go with a gangster when it comes to divorce.  Yeah, you need to go to the guinea.  I'd say blacks and Italians are leading the lawyer, right?  Shapiro and Cochran would be the two.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[00:30:30]  But a true Jew lawyer is what you need.  Shapiro's a Jew, you fucking idiot.  Shapiro's Italian.  Isn't that Italian?  He's a Jew.  He's a Jew.  Yeah, he's Jewish.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  Shapiro is a Jewish name?  Yeah.  Sounds Italian to me.  It ends with a vowel.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they still make the best lawyers.  I know that.  That was...  Okay.  So...  Sorry.  So...  That wasn't a knock against Jewish people.  No, no.  So, but I'm not talking about the anti-Semitism.  Yeah.  After Israel retaliated against Lebanon, I'm talking throughout the... 
[00:31:00]  I guess the liberal media in this country makes Israel look like the bad guy in this country.  Yep.  When yet, they're doing what anybody else would do.  Right.  In that situation.  Yeah, but then there's the people that will say they don't deserve to be doing that anyway  because they have to do a little more sharing as far as their land goes.  Well, that's kind of weird because after the Six-Day War and they took the land from Egypt  and they gave it back...  I understand the history, but it's not like your example before.  It's not like Connecticut is trying to take some of New York's land or setting up buffer boundaries into... 
[00:31:30]  Well, Lebanon didn't take land from Lebanon.  They didn't take any...  So why is Lebanon shooting missiles over there?  Because they get pissed that their Palestinian brethren are being so oppressed by...  Well, but not yet one Arab nation will take the Palestinians.  No, because they say that they deserve to be in Israel's land and that Jerusalem is part of their holy land and they're entitled to it.  And that's why there's a problem. 
[00:32:00]  I guess Mexico deserves to take Texas and California back.  No, we kicked the shit out of them for that fucking property.  Okay, and so did Israel during...  When six countries came after them during the Six-Day War and wanted to wipe them off the face of the earth and take their land...  How long was that war?  Six days.  Oh.  I think it was six days and a couple hours.  Why is it?  Yeah, you know...  It went over time a little bit?  I think it went four hours.  You know, and I'm not talking about breaks, coffee and stuff like that.  Yeah, I've always thought it was actually a five-day word, but they thought six had a better sound to it. 
[00:32:30]  It does sound better, yeah.  So they said six-day word.  You just did my joke opposite, you fucking asshole.  I said six days and four hours, and you went five days.  You did my joke completely...  I'm talking serious here.  So, they took that land...  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you when you were talking serious.  Okay, oh, wait, let's do that one again.  Let's go after this.  It's always funny to me, and I don't care.  It's always funny to me.  I'm going to say it every time.  I'm going to order you some breakfast.  So, what I'm saying is...  What does that mean?  I'm hungry.  I'm going to order you breakfast, because I like them. 
[00:33:00]  They broke.  Let me see.  No, why?  So you can break them again?  No, we're not going to break them.  You don't want to break them.  Let me just see them.  What's there to see?  Because they look nice.  I want to see them while I'm listening to you.  You can't bite them.  Why would you want to eat them?  You should have break them or throw them.  You fucking asshole.  So, you understand what I'm saying?  Yes.  Why...  Not one country will take the Palestinians who were Syrians before the six-day war.  And all of a sudden, they're balanced in.  Right.  You know, all of a sudden, ooh, here's a new race of people. 
[00:33:30]  After they were trying to abolish Israel, Israel wins a war, takes land like any other country  does, then gives it back to Egypt, you know, in the peace treaty for us to help arm them.  Okay?  Which this country is too fucking dumb to know.  And they go, well, why are we supporting Israel?  Why are we sending over military?  Well, no one knows about the history.  Yeah.  Why are we sending over military?  Which we send more money to Egypt than we do to fucking Israel.  All right? 
[00:34:00]  But...  You're sounding very Jewish now.  No, well, we do.  You're sounding a little biased.  Do we send more money to Egypt than Israel?  Yes.  I don't know.  I know we send a lot to Egypt, and we shouldn't send a penny to Egypt, especially while they're  holding American hostages right now, but...  Why do we fund Israel's military?  Because during the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, that was part of the deal.  Give back land.  We'll help support you.  Right, right, right.  Okay.  I know this.  And land is worth a lot of fucking money.  What I'm getting at, what I'm getting at here... 
[00:34:30]  This conversation is a hoot.  I know.  No.  What I'm getting at...  You asked me one question.  Should we bomb the shit out of some fucking savages?  I said, yeah.  I think now that...  You can't call them savages.  What?  I liked when we were doing the Indiana Jones bit better.  I know.  About India.  Right?  I know you said you wanted to talk, and you're smart when it comes to this stuff.  I would love to talk, but, you know, keep that stuff to, you know, a minimum.  All right.  We were talking about fucking stupid drunken Christmases, and, you know, E-Rock's birthday 
[00:35:00]  is today.  Oh.  E-Rock.  The big...  Happy birthday.  Big 4-0.  The big 4-0.  No, it's not the big 4-0.  There's waste.  How old are you, E-Rock?  34.  34.  34 last year.  That's how old I am.  Ew.  We're the same age.  You're 34?  Yeah.  Look at how much more Joe has accomplished.  Where did he go?  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What did he say?  Hold it, E-Rock.  I think he turned 34 last year as well.  Oh, shit.  Are you shaving? 
[00:35:30]  34 years?  You don't shave until you're 40, so...  Is that it?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you shaving years, E-Rock?  Nope.  Don't fucking lie to me.  1978.  78?  Yep.  Damn, man.  Shit.  How does it feel?  No different than the last few.  Yeah, huh?  I'll tell you what.  They're going faster, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, same.  Fucking shit.  For a nice birthday present, you know, because I want to show you good times as a thank you.  KFC?  No, I'll take you out tonight, and we'll talk about whether or not Iran should fucking bomb 
[00:36:00]  Israel for two fucking hours.  Here's the deal.  Won't that be fun?  Not here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  Deep down, because he's Middle Eastern.  He was adopted.  Oh, is that it?  I'm half Egyptian.  Okay, here's the deal.  That's great.  So he doesn't bring that out, but deep down inside, he hates us all.  He does.  He hates us all.  We're all infidels in Joe's eyes.  He does.  And let me tell you something.  Not only does he bomb on stage, he wants to bomb everywhere.  Oh, we get it.  Oh, my God.  Would you stop with the... 
[00:36:30]  You're fucking sissy.  You're 34 years old.  34.  Yeah.  You were 20...  How old were you when you first came on board this wonderful program?  26.  26.  Wow.  What is different between 26 and 34 in your life? 
[00:37:00]  Like, what have you noticed?  His belly.  I was going to say that.  Yeah, there's plenty of jokes.  Were you a chubby little fuck when you first came on the show?  No, not at all.  No, you're in shape?  No, it took about two years into it before it all went to hell.  So, now, how are you feeling at 34?  Because I know after 30, it's not an immediate thing, but it's the downhill slide into 40,  which is then a much steeper slide into 50. 
[00:37:30]  So, what's the difference?  How do you feel differently?  Well, you start to realize that less and less of your family, to extended family,  either remember or care that it's your birthday.  You're close enough.  See, Iraq's close enough to his youth to remember when people gave a shit,  or at least had a fake, that they gave a shit about your birthday.  Exactly.  Like, you used to get cards and presents from, like, family that you maybe see a couple times. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, aunts, uncles, cousins.  They don't live anywhere near you.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, it's like, well, all right, your parents sent a card,  and your siblings sent a card, but everybody else that you grew up with,  or, yeah, you don't hear from them anymore.  You don't hear from them anymore.  And those cards don't have anything in them anymore.  Oh, see, you used to get the little check.  You used to get those thick envelopes with those ridiculous cards that had, like, glitter or pop-up things in it.  Right.  But they always had, like, a Best Buy card or Toys R Us or something for clothes.  Yeah, yeah.  And now you're just getting happy birthday.  Not even a love, and it's just his happy birthday, family member name. 
[00:38:30]  I don't remember that at all, but you're close enough to remember that.  It also sucks because the older you get, the more relatives die.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  You get less and less.  So you get less shit.  And that's really the sorrow about the relatives dying.  You ever read cards, like, if you have to give, like, a Mother's Day card or a card?  Like, for my wife, for Valentine's Day, I just wrote on an index card, Happy Valentine's Day.  Because you read the cards, and you're sitting there going, well, I don't feel this way about this person.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's all this stuff, and you're going, I really don't like this person. 
[00:39:00]  They're all very schmaltzy.  Well, because, you know, it's to your mom, you know, thank you for being there and loving and caring.  But you weren't.  Yeah.  You know, they don't have that fucking card that says, hey, thank you for leaving me on Grandma and Grandpa's doorstep saying I don't want them.  You know, hey, thank you for having my dad set up.  You know, they don't have those fucking cards.  You're not in the right neighborhood buying your cards.  I buy the Ebony collection sometimes.  They're hilarious.  If somebody gives you a card that doesn't have money in it, or a handwritten note, all they're saying is, can you throw this away for me? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, yeah, here.  It's the most pointless fucking thing.  Here's some garbage.  Here's something for the shredder.  Well, maybe you don't have a four-year-old that wrote, love, daddy, happy Valentine's Day.  No, but that's different.  But that's what I'm saying.  That's different.  Yeah.  That's a sentiment.  You know what I mean?  You're getting it from older people.  And I don't want a four-year-old because I don't want to have to share my KFC bucket with anybody.  You know what's cards are great when you go into the store and you pick it up and it's the anniversary or even Valentine's Day, the loving couple card that isn't quite loving. 
[00:40:00]  It's sort of like, though I do not say it as many times as I should throughout the year, I do love you.  And it's like, this is from a guy who reads that and goes, this is appropriate because I really don't like her anymore.  She's a fucking bitch.  I'm obligated to get her something.  So I'll get her the card that says, bah, aside from Valentine's Day and your birthday, I really don't even acknowledge that we're a couple.  It takes everything in my power to not put a pillow over your fucking face when I see you sleeping. 
[00:40:30]  Every night.  But here's some candy.  Yeah.  When I get my older daughter's birthday cards, I get it with a black eye in it and I go,  A black eye in it?  Who they're not allowed to be with.  Ah, yes, yes.  Again, from the Ebony collection.  And here's the thing, too, with birthdays, if you're not 21 or 100, nobody gives a fuck.  Nobody really, like, it's my birthday.  Those benchmark birthdays, yeah, yeah.  21 or 100.  It's my birthday, we're celebrating all week.  Go fuck yourself. 
[00:41:00]  Nobody cares.  Look, it does get sadder through the years.  Iraq makes a good point.  Yes.  And so do you, Rich.  But I have a party every year for my birthday.  By party, I mean I just tell my friends, go to this bar and we'll get wasted.  Yeah, I've been to a couple of your birthday shindigs.  You've been there.  None of you other motherfuckers ever show up.  I went to one.  The boss shows up.  You guys can't fucking come.  This sounds like a drunken rant at the bar.  Where the fuck were they when I was fucking out of my breath? 
[00:41:30]  I mean, when you can come out, Anthony.  We got shit from Danny and Sam that they can't be here.  Anyway, it does get sadder and sadder every year on the next day.  Like when I wake up with that hangover and I'm like, I'm 34.  What was that about?  It's not a, it's just kind of.  40 is more of a motherfucker than 50.  40 is a motherfucker.  Why?  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  You just, when I turn 40, I'm going, oh, I have my fucking wife.  Kennedy was just shot.  No, it's depressing.  It's pretty good.  That wasn't bad.  I like that one.  Thank you, Rich.  No, because like, if your life isn't going right at 40, you're going, it's too fucking  late.  I remember at 40, I'm sitting in my shitty apartment, no fucking wife, no fucking semi-career  back then.  And I'm going, I got, my kids were off to school, you know, I used to watch them every 
[00:42:30]  day in the day.  So at least my days were full.  It was like the empty nest.  And I'm going, I have not.  And let me tell you something.  The fucking anxiety was so fucking bad that it was, it was insane.  Yeah.  I turned 40, you know, 50, you're like, ah, fuck.  It's, it's a weird, it's a weird situation.  No matter how old you are, I think, unless you're just, you know, early twenties or something  like that, as long as your birthdays keep going on and you're not where you want to  be, or you're not doing something, or you're really a bum, uh, you will get horrific anxiety. 
[00:43:00]  I think that's what brought mine on in my twenties because I was like no prospects whatsoever.  I was fucking, uh, you know, in, in construction jobs and, uh, and just, it, it, it killed me  because I knew I did not belong there.  I did not belong with the guy that was fucking on the roof, putting shingles up, talking about  his fucking kids and how he can't afford anything.  And it just sucked.  It's, it's, it's, it's, there's nothing worse than that man without a country feeling. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, and I went through that too in my twenties because I was trying to figure out comedy.  I didn't know what I wanted to do yet.  I didn't know what I was going to do.  Here goes Rich.  I know.  How's that working out for you?  How's that working?  It's just the worst.  Trying to figure out who left me at a firehouse in Palestine.  Take it easy.  My mom's listening this morning.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, now you feel bad?  You scumbag.  I'm so aww.  You don't feel bad because I'm your friend.  Come on in, Mother DeRosa. 
[00:44:00]  Listen to the show.  I called my dad today.  I go, I go, tell mom, you and mom listened to the show today on your way to work.  And I go, if it gets too dirty, just, just turn it off.  Most people will call their parents and go, hey, I'm on Letterman.  I have an HBO special.  Hey, I'm doing radio.  Hey, I'm doing radio.  And don't listen when it gets dirty.  Hey, do you want to call me as I'm driving to fucking Poughkeepsie?  You fucking zero.  Hey, I'm on radio.  I didn't want to come into this piece of shit show.  Where the fuck are you going, Rich, between now and 10? 
[00:44:30]  Exactly.  What do you got?  Fucking headlining bananas.  I don't see you going on fucking any of these morning shows on our six televisions.  Oh, look, you don't take this fucking personal.  You don't want to be here either, so go fuck yourself.  Oh, please.  I know.  That alarm goes off.  I'm like, if you didn't go on your Italian cruise, you wouldn't be here today, okay?  Your stupid low-budget vacations.  Low-budget.  That was fantastic.  I was hoping your fucking boat capsized.  So was I.  It looked exciting, a boat sinking.  Anthony really is. 
[00:45:00]  I'm fucking lost.  Hey, yeah.  How long, Island?  You are such a fucking dago.  He still takes package vacations.  Hey, yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, the food.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Hey, baby, this is a good deal.  Hey, look at where we are.  Oh, you can eat.  Where's our next port-a-call?  It's like you got a hotel that moves around with you.  You went on an Anthony Peccarello tour. 
[00:45:30]  No.  Look.  When I go on a cruise, it's not the package deal.  I don't do the meal card where you're only allowed certain things and drinks.  I go on a cart with everything.  I'm a spender.  That's what I do.  Do you spend a long weekend at the Poconos in a fucking champagne glass?  I have done that.  I have done that.  How many?  Every? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Every.  You're a trash with money.  He is now.  I've never denied it.  You're a tin knocker with money.  I've never denied it, Rich.  New money.  Anthony brings down the class average everywhere he goes.  They go, oh, here comes this new money.  I have never made a peep to try to sound like I'm some fucking guy with a little bit of cash  that isn't the whitest trash from Long Island.  I'm the same piece of shit I was when I was living in a one bedroom and knocking tin. 
[00:46:30]  Every trip Anthony takes, there's a heart-shaped bathtub involved at some point.  You know there is.  I had my own jacuzzi on the fucking deck on my fucking balcony.  My own jacuzzi.  I'm sitting there with beers.  Hey, yeah.  In this grace.  Hey, look at us.  We got our own suite on the boat, honey.  Come on in.  Hey, we got our own butler.  This is clay. 
[00:47:00]  Every trip he goes, I miss a parent.  Honey got his daughter.  Hey, why don't you take this with you there?  Hey, and there's plenty more where that came from.  You're just like when Ralph Cram did, like, get some money.  I want a boat with tree propellers.  And a string of block of these.  He gave him $100 just to take the clicking out of the telephone.  My good man, small things to a millionaire.  How are I from?  And there's plenty more where that came from. 
[00:47:30]  I get to see you on the deck of the boat with the ascot on.  I am terribly white trash.  I do things I think people with money should do, but it's so, like, wrong.  Our concierge comes in to greet us while we're sitting in this lounge area on the boat before we go to our rooms.  And I know that everybody tips these people at the end of the cruise.  Uh-uh.  I'm a tipper right off the bat.  So I put a five, you know, a couple of hundreds, 500 in my hand. 
[00:48:00]  And I'm the worst at slipping it because I'm trying to be smooth.  But it almost ends up like I'm thrusting it at him because he doesn't know what to do.  So I'm just like, ah!  It's falling out of my hand.  He's got to pick it up off the floor.  I'm trying to be smooth.  But that's just, I'm trash.  I love how you do it smooth.  And he's looking at you going, asshole, everybody tips us.  Just give me the fucking tip.  Just give me the money.  But I want him to know that I'm giving him a fucking lot of money. 
[00:48:30]  That people tip him, like, fucking maybe a hundred.  But where do you tip?  Who do you tip on the boat?  Because I never know who you do.  The first time you meet up with a concierge, tip that motherfucker.  But what do you get out of it when you tip the concierge on a boat?  That way, let's say I want to go on a shore excursion.  I can get off the boat lickety-split.  I take his fucking little private elevator down to get off the boat.  I skip all the lines and everything like that.  If I want dinner at one of the restaurants on the ship, reservation, smeservation. 
[00:49:00]  I get right in there.  I go, I want to have dinner at the Toppenaki place in two hours.  All right, Mr. Anthony.  I don't know why.  Mr. Anthony, yes, Mr. Anthony, you are fine.  You go there.  So that really works.  Yes, you've got to grease them.  Like when you heavy tip the concierge.  Not at KFC.  Your concierge.  Yeah, they don't have a concierge at KFC.  And then the butler.  You've got to tip your butler.  He comes in, and he's the guy who's going to be getting you everything you ask for. 
[00:49:30]  So, you know.  So how much did you tip that guy?  I gave him $300 right off the bat.  And he comes in with, like, sandwiches.  So every day when you come back from your little excursion, the room's all decked out with food and fucking booze and all kinds of shit.  Do you tip him again at the end?  Yeah, and then I tip him a little more at the end.  I don't give him another $300.  But yeah, I'd probably toss him another $100.  I heard on a cruise.  I don't know.  You work him, right?  Do you do cruise?  Oh, shit.  That's a comedy insult, people, when you say he's a book comic. 
[00:50:00]  I've tried, but you've got all the weekends.  Did you just come back with I'm rubber, you're glue?  I have all the weekends.  Do you understand how?  I'm rubber, you're glue.  Do you understand?  Rich has no concept of ad-libbing.  He says something, and then you build off of it.  He goes, did you just say something along the lines of what I said?  That's stupid.  That's how fucking riffing works.  This isn't Meisner riffing.  Riffing, you asshole.  I heard on a cruise you can go eat any time, like 24 hours. 
[00:50:30]  You can go and have, like, lava.  You can if you want to fucking go to the buffet with the fat fucking farmers.  Oh, that's what it is?  And go to the buffet, or E-Rod.  No, I like going to the restaurants.  I like, if I want something in the room, the butler comes in, and he will literally set the room up like a restaurant.  A nice table by the big window overlooking the deck.  With lobster.  Yes, and tablecloth, the candles, the flowers, everything, and set it up.  And he doesn't bring you everything in tins like room service. 
[00:51:00]  It's on civilized plates.  And it's the main course.  And then he comes back and brings the next thing, and then dessert.  That's what you're paying for.  So you can't get that.  You can't get that kind of meal.  No.  The average person on the cruise can't get that.  Not when your room is in the bilge down below decks.  No.  What's the bilge?  What's that mean?  The bilge.  It's between here and here.  Oh, no, that's the point in his gut.  No, that's the part in the boat that is full of water that gets pumped out. 
[00:51:30]  Look how much these are tighter on my weight.  No!  DeRosa fakes out Voss and farts in his face.  We've reached that point.  It was a girl fart.  Does Mrs. DeRosa have to tune out for that one?  I don't know.  Mama DeRosa.  I think my mom can hang for the fart humor.  Everything we're talking about so far is good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think we're okay.  Possibly when we get into some of the female discussions.  That might be where it gets a little heavy. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  Were we chatting about anything that might come up as far as female stuff before the show started?  I don't think so.  No.  I think we were pretty safe.  If they play the clips from that thing, I might ask my mom to stop listening.  Oh, okay.  Right, right.  If that happens.  Yeah, yeah.  From the podcast.  Yes, yes.  I want to hear some of that shit because I heard it's hilarious.  I'm glad you want to hear it.  By the way, that wasn't my way of slipping that in.  No, no, no.  I know.  I heard you and Danny talking about it earlier.  It's you.  You went out with a girl.  Yeah.  And she turned out, as Joe says, to be just a fucking lunatic bitch. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, is that the one I met at Cal?  It just goes really badly.  No, no.  It went badly.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, man.  You are a spot blower upper.  You're just Christ.  You don't say shit like that.  You said it on a podcast, you fucking idiot.  You don't say shit like that.  I didn't say anything about Caroline's on the podcast.  I did just now.  Wow.  Do you blow people's spot up?  You really are.  Are you a man?  How the fuck do I know?  Rich, you just know not to say shit about a guy and a girl at a place. 
[00:53:00]  You're putting shit together.  So when you're on the cruise, right?  Wait.  No, you're not.  Oh, you're not getting away with that.  He's literally like, this is what Rich is like in every conversation.  Like, if you took your dad and tried to, like, pull off a heist with your dad, and you're  like, Dad, all I need you to do is walk into the bank and say this.  Like, the way, like, anybody's dad would fuck that up royally.  That's everything with Rich.  You're just an old, dumb man.  I'm not that dumb. 
[00:53:30]  You should know, though.  I'm fucking pretty smart.  Well, no.  I haven't been in the game in fucking 20 years.  That's street smarts right there.  I'm street.  I didn't know.  You got zero street smarts.  No.  Are you crazy?  You just fucked up his spot.  I didn't fuck up his spot.  Nobody's listening.  He's, stop it.  Don't act like that.  Every time you come in.  You got me on that one.  He goes, I was street.  You just said, I'm street smart because I used to be a crackhead.  You know those savvy crackheads?  Oh, yeah.  I always ask them questions about life. 
[00:54:00]  You mean those brilliant people that'll suck dick in public?  No, don't mix.  Yeah, they're fucking riddled with street smarts.  Don't mix pleasure with addiction.  What I'm saying is.  No, there's a difference between street smarts and knowing what, like, the guy code.  You don't blow a guy's spot up like that.  I didn't blow a guy's spot up.  Although Joe blew my spot up on a podcast once.  I did?  Yeah, you said something, and my chick was listening, and she's like, what the fuck was 
[00:54:30]  that?  Oh, I just, and it wasn't even on purpose, but I neglected to say something about the  strip club we went to that night.  Oh, dude.  And you got on the air on your podcast, and she was listening to it, and you started talking  about how we were hammered at the strip club and lap dances and stuff, and I'm like,  oh, boy, and she was like, oh, God, you went with Joe to the fucking strip, those fucking  whores and getting lapped down.  I'm like, yeah, we fucking were having pissers.  It's not, and then I have to do the why guys go to strip club things. 
[00:55:00]  It's not to sit there and beat off in a corner like an animal.  It's fun to hang out with Joe DeRosa, have some drinks, and fucking look at some hosebags  dance around.  But when, you know, you were talking about it, she was like, oh, man.  I'm like, fucking DeRosa.  I'm so sorry.  How could you know?  Sorry, dude.  No, no, no.  I've hung myself out to dry more times on this show, so it doesn't really matter.  Okay.  Sometimes you never know.  Two things.  That was a rookie.  That was a rookie.  Fuck yourself.  Why? 
[00:55:30]  You attack me, and then when he does, yeah.  Joe could do more for me than you can.  He can't do more for you.  That's a good point.  Listen to me.  Did he put you in his movie?  Did he put me in anything?  It wasn't my movie.  Yes, you have a great part.  Listen, I need you.  You were on my show and rolled a fucking video camera.  It wasn't your show.  I was on Opie's that day.  Okay?  And I put you in, and you came off great.  Oh, thank you.  You came off better than everybody.  Listen.  Smart, intelligent, funny.  Here's the thing with the strip club thing.  First of all, I'm talking to Anthony. 
[00:56:00]  He's not listening.  Go ahead.  It wasn't my movie.  Please don't say that.  Why?  It was a great movie.  No, it was our movie.  It wasn't my movie.  That's what you tell everybody.  No, I don't.  Stop it.  Oh, man.  Stop it.  Are you kidding me?  I would never say that.  Your intro is, he's the creator, director, and star.  Are you kidding me?  I don't say that.  Stop.  Stop.  I don't know.  You really are the Spielberg of that movie.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  Stop.  You just, you know, director.  Writer, acting in it.  Yeah.  Score.  Writer, co-producer. 
[00:56:30]  Editor.  Oh, my God.  I did direct it, but it is not my movie.  Oh, everybody.  It was our movie.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought it was your movie.  I see what you guys are doing, and I will stop this discussion now.  I'm not leading myself down this path.  Mommy, it's not my movie.  Is that the movie Cheat?  Or Cheaters?  What is it called?  Our movie was called Cheat.  Cheat.  Yes.  Cheat.  Yes, yes.  Very good.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Very good.  Yeah.  The Doorman was great.  Oh, that was Rich Voss.  The Doorman.  Rich Voss.  Classic. 
[00:57:00]  Classic.  We bring Rich on.  We do the scene four times with the lines in the script, and then I go, you know what,  Rich?  Just make up your own lines.  As long as we get to this point, he does it once.  I go, perfect.  We got it.  That's a cut.  I got an audition on tape that I sent the other day.  They go, do it in your own words.  Oh, boy.  That must have been hard to understand with subtitles.  He has to send an audition tape with subtitles.  I would.  Yes, Mr. DeRosa. 
[00:57:30]  It's like the Buckwheat sketch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's an old Buckwheat sketch.  It's just question marks.  Yeah.  So, I want to apologize for blowing up Anthony's spot with the strip club thing, because here's  and it's not an, that was a rookie fucking move on my part.  Here was the, but here's just the, what happened.  And we were talking about Patrice and that night and how turbulent and emotional it was 
[00:58:00]  for everybody.  Yes.  Going to his funeral and all that stuff.  And then I said, you know, I ended up going out with Anthony after and I was talking about  our night and I was like, we were really drunk.  But, but in, you know, I think, I think we're, the subject was everybody copes in their own  way.  Right.  And we coped with alcohol and whores.  It like, it was a, it was still bonding.  It was like, we went to a strip club and we bonded as friends and like, it was like our, 
[00:58:30]  I feel like it was our way of getting through the, the, the, the emotional pain of that night.  I'm not just saying that.  You're right.  And I never, I never plan on going in that place, but it's, it's right on the way to  wherever we're going.  It's like just there.  And then you go, ah, you, you know, and it's always such a good idea when you're hammered  to go in there.  It's like, Hey, you want to go in?  Yeah.  I mean, you go in and it sucks anyway.  I'm really hot.  The dancer's hot.  They're always okay. 
[00:59:00]  We're walking out of Patrice's funeral and he's crying and sniffling and it's, it's so  fucking depressing.  And he's crying and Bonnie's standing behind him and goes, you have a cold?  Oh, but she's the ice queen.  That one.  She's a bad person.  I call her the next day.  I go, you're just a bad fucking person.  She comes across as sweet for two seconds.  Like to look at her.  And then she is a despicable person.  She's sweet.  She's, she's, Bonnie is, it's like when you drink fluoride at the dentist, the initial 
[00:59:30]  thing is like, Oh, that's sweet.  I'm going to vomit all over the place right now.  I'm a little miffed with Bonnie also because she does not follow me on Twitter.  And that's somebody I believe should follow me.  She will.  I'll tell her.  I follow her.  No, it's nothing that you could tell.  She probably should know you're on Twitter.  Oh, really?  She probably should have just done it.  You can't tell somebody, Hey, you're not following that person. 
[01:00:00]  You follow him because then it's insincere.  Well, but here's the thing.  She knows how talented and funny you are.  So there's just, she probably over, she is kind of airy.  I follow her because I find the things she says on Twitter, funny and entertaining.  And I feel she should reciprocate by maybe finding some of the stuff I say.  She's new to Twitter too.  So she is kind of airy about it.  Boy, you are making some excuses for your life.  Because it's nice though.  But she found John Stamos on there.  Uh-huh.  She does follow John Stamos. 
[01:00:30]  Of course, because he banged her.  That's fucking, you know what?  That is fucking true.  She's following John Stamos.  She follows Norton.  And like, I don't even know, she might be following Opie.  Maybe she doesn't like you.  That's what I, that's instantly what I start thinking.  Like, she don't fucking like me for some reason.  How do you know, you got so many followers.  How do you know who's, how do you?  I know, Rich.  I look.  How many followers you have?  88,000 and change.  I'm trying to get to 100,000, but I don't push it as hard as some people do. 
[01:01:00]  Oh God.  Some people just make me sick.  I know comics.  When they tweet, like, when they tweet, just some people just make me sick with them.  Just tweet to get followers.  Yeah, it just makes me sick.  It really does.  I know comics.  I know comics that, I don't want to say anything, that nobody fuck, that whole nerdy crew, you  know what I'm talking about?  I know guys that have 100 and some followers, and nobody knows who they're talking about.  100 and some thousand?  100 and some thousand.  Thousand's an important word that you left out there.  Yeah, you guys are 100 and something. 
[01:01:30]  You know what I mean.  That don't know, don't fucking try to, you know what I'm saying.  You have 100 and some thousand followers, and you're going, who the fuck are they?  How do they do it?  Well, I guess in their life, they've achieved something.  Is there an app where you can get more followers or something?  No.  It's just called Charisma, right?  It's called Good Posts.  Well, he's kind of famous, right?  Yeah, I guess, but two and a half fucking million?  That's a lot.  That's a fucking lot. 
[01:02:00]  That's a lot of followers.  You know how many Judah has?  Judah has a quarter million.  I know, he's on Dirty Rock, for Christ's sake.  If you're on TV, you're going to get a lot of fucking Twitter followers.  How many do you have?  23,000?  Yeah.  I don't try, though.  I never plug it.  But you don't, you're not, yeah.  I never plug it.  And you can't just put plugs up if you're a comic.  That's one of the comic's biggest problems.  They're funny guys, and then all they do is plug where they're going to be.  No one wants to see that.  Fucking unfollow.  You gotta, you know.  Stop it.  That's what I do.  Stop it.  I know, but you know.  Yeah, but that only happens once a month.  You threw a nugget out last night. 
[01:02:30]  That was fucking killer.  That goddamn Bobby Kelly headshot bit that you guys did is fucking funny, man.  I want to hear you laugh at that.  It's fantastic.  That's what I want to hear.  That's what I want to hear.  I watched it three times last night.  Bobby edited a video of me, of him having me look at his new headshots, and he put it  up last night, and he called me, and he goes, send this out.  So I sent it out on Twitter, and then Anthony retweeted it. 
[01:03:00]  That's all it is.  Because it's so bad.  He had the best line.  Bobby's picture is so bad.  He had the best line during the tweet roast.  Hands down the best line.  And he said to the next person to go on stage, be careful not stepping in the shit.  Oh, step in the shit that Billy Crystal left on.  That one got me, man.  It was so fucking funny.  Don't step on the shit Billy Crystal just left on the stage.  Yeah, be careful, Tom.  Be careful not slipping that huge pile of shit Billy just left out there. 
[01:03:30]  So fucking funny, man.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I loved when Rich wrote, when Christopher Plummer won, and he wrote, he's white, I'm not standing  up.  That fucking audience is liberal.  Oh, the liberal crap.  That woman from The Help, what the hell was her name?  You know, you're half of her.  Octavia Spencer.  Octavia Spencer.  She wins for Best Supporting Actress for The Help, and she goes up and she's all in tears 
[01:04:00]  after doing the red carpet.  And every time they showed her, people had to crow about how beautiful she looks in that  dress.  She's fucking fat.  Stop it.  She looks acceptable for a fat person in a dress, in a gown, but she's not fucking gorgeous.  She's no Michelle fucking Williams who looked fantastic with her little pixie-doo haircut.  But she looked great.  Michelle Williams who looked great, and Jennifer Hudson looks so hot.  Yeah.  She lost all that weight.  She looks fucking gorgeous. 
[01:04:30]  She even looks good.  And then they bring her up, and it's like, no, no, she's not.  But, all right.  Then she goes up on stage to accept, and that white audience couldn't get on their feet faster.  Couldn't fucking get on their...  It's like they had electric shock things in the chairs.  It's almost insulting.  It is insulting.  It wasn't a milestone Oscar for a black person, first of all.  It wasn't the first black person to win an Oscar.  It wasn't the first black woman to win an Oscar.  It was just another black woman that won a supporting actress. 
[01:05:00]  It was really...  At the end, she was a method actress.  Oh.  Jesus.  I wrote, when that happened, I tweeted out, can Hollywood, could these Hollywood people  possibly be more racist in their attempt to show how not racist they are?  How not racist they are.  It was one of the most demeaning things I've ever seen.  Because you have to calculate that.  They were acting like she was mentally incapable of it or something.  We did.  Give her a standing O. 
[01:05:30]  You would have done that if somebody that was brain damaged got out there.  You would have done that if somebody wheeled out on a wheelchair and accepted Moscow.  And then they stand up and do that.  And then you get the black person.  So, of course, you've got to stand up.  The white people are like, well, we've got to stand.  Oh, they've fucking got me sick.  And it's a conscious thought of racism that makes them stand up.  Well, when they...  I don't know if it was Oscar for Best Short or Documentary, but it was an Iranian thing.  Yes.  And you know who Holly...  You know who the voters are.  They're all fucking...  The Jews, Rich.  The Jews. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, these people hate us.  They want to kill us.  Winner.  Yeah, yeah.  You just...  You're going, what the fuck goes on in their fucking heads?  It's bizarro world on the Oscars.  Yeah.  You can't...  Well, there have been a lot of articles and, you know, essays about that where it's like  we have a tendency to glorify people that...  Now, obviously, I know the guys that made that film don't hate us.  And they're, you know, and it's like...  It is kind of an anti-Iranian government movie. 
[01:06:30]  As anti as you can get without getting your head cut off.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And I...  Look, I have...  Classic...  Classic...  I'm about to say racist thing statement.  I have friends that are Iranian.  Disclaimer.  But no, I do.  And it's like...  I understand that it's a divided people.  Yeah.  I get that.  So...  But my...  But the point of these essays is we have a tendency to try to seek out the art from...  Or the representatives, in a way, of this culture that dislikes us and show how much we like 
[01:07:00]  those people.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yes.  To show that we're still...  That we are civilized.  We're the tolerant ones.  We're the civilized ones.  We're the superior ones.  It's like...  Look.  Look at what we do for you.  We're going to give you a standing ovation.  How great do you feel about that?  It's so phony.  It's so calculated.  And no one talks about it.  We're going to give you low housing to keep you out of our neighborhoods. 
[01:07:30]  Well, that's a good idea, Rich.  What's...  Ixnay on the Olay Oscar housing.  Yay.  We need that.  I was...  When they stood for her, I really wanted to throw a fucking...  It was crazy.  I know.  There was no reason.  There was no reason for it.  It was demeaning.  It was really demeaning to her.  Yeah.  It didn't...  And I...  I was upset that she was touched by...  Like, to me...  I mean, and you can't...  Who's going to do this?  But to me, I wanted her to be like, go fuck yourselves. 
[01:08:00]  Just sit down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a good actor, asshole.  Sit your asses down.  You crack a motherfucker.  Yeah.  It was just really...  My buddy kept going tweet...  Telling me to tweet this and I wouldn't do it.  I chickened out.  And I go, if I was on the radio, I'd say it.  But I go, I'm not writing that.  I'm not letting that be out there permanently.  Be a permanent record.  Yeah.  But he goes...  He goes...  He just keeps going, tweet.  Tweet Angelita.  This just did Angelita.  Attempted to adopt three cast members from the help.  That's funny, man.  It's hilarious. 
[01:08:30]  And I was scared to tweet it.  Oh, no.  I was just...  Because I was like, there's no tone in the tweet.  I just didn't want to do it.  Isn't it...  It just scared me.  Don't you find it fucked that you have to second guess a funny joke like that because  you're afraid?  Yeah.  How we've gotten to the point where we're literally afraid now to tweet things because, like you  said, it's a permanent record.  I was talking the other day with somebody and we were talking about how in the past you  thought of the future and Big Brother and 1984 and stuff like that. 
[01:09:00]  Wasn't it you I was talking to in the bar that night?  And we just...  Like most of our conversations, I...  Exactly.  It's cloudy.  It's a fucking...  It's a haze.  An alcohol-induced fog on conversations, Joe.  I can't remember half of this shit.  But I think it was.  But we were talking, I think, about Big Brother and how they've always brought up Big Brother,  Big Brother and the government having cameras infringe upon your privacy with traffic cameras  and these other security cameras and then how they're listening in on your conversations 
[01:09:30]  and just putting your life out there, your credit reports, all this shit.  And then you thought about this ominous form of the government like in the movie 1984.  And the truth of the matter is it's evolved into something that we never fucking expected.  Big Brother is all of us, the collective, which is the government.  It is the people.  But we're the ones that the second you do something, who's pulling out their cameras? 
[01:10:00]  The people around you.  And they post it online and they put it up there for everyone to see.  It's not the government that's posting your privacy.  It's you.  It's everyone else.  We were...  We're the guys.  We were...  We the ones be putting up the pitches.  We were talking about this.  I remember this now.  And, yeah, the whole theory behind it was the government...  Because the government is much, much, much more involved in the advancement of technology 
[01:10:30]  than I think most people realize.  Like, I took a great class when I was in college.  It was called the History of...  I think it was called the History of Telecommunications or something like that.  But it went through the evolution...  Stay awake during that one.  Jesus.  Well, it was really interesting to me.  I'm the first one to college.  But it was...  It was the...  Well, state school.  I wasn't like I was...  I wasn't wooing anybody.  No, Ivy Leagher.  Yeah.  So it was...  But it was about the history of television and radio, basically. 
[01:11:00]  And my teacher talked about how...  It was on the eve of digital television when I was in school.  It hadn't come out yet.  HD television, digital TV or whatever.  And he said, this technology was...  We could have been there literally in the 70s or the 60s.  And he goes, but they just stopped.  They stopped.  And they stopped because the government said they weren't going to allow the further development of it.  I guess they were funding it or whatever it was. 
[01:11:30]  They just stopped.  Now, what was the reasoning there?  There was no documented reason.  But it was just very obvious that it was like,  the government will decide when it's the right time for digital television to be released.  You know what I mean?  For high definition and all of these...  Because of the doors that that will open.  I heard it was a bandwidth issue early on.  I also heard that so many people and the infrastructure was invested on broadcast television and then cable television  that it just would have taken so long.  Well, I mean, yeah, there's that. 
[01:12:00]  And the money that it would have taken years ago to get the equipment in place that we have now,  now it's easy, you know, relatively speaking.  It would have been very tough back then to do it.  You see the way the technology has...  Here's my point.  You see the way the technology has...  Advanced isn't even the word for it.  Yeah, it's crazy now.  In the last...  In under 10 years...  Right.  In under 10 years, home stereo systems have become obsolete.  Right. 
[01:12:30]  DVD players, VCRs, and almost Blu-ray players have become obsolete.  Not in my house.  Of course, not VCR over there.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  Beta was good.  Yeah.  It's probably still has a rack system.  A big rack system.  A techniques turntable.  And I got this touchscreen remote and it controls everything.  What did Billy set you up with?  Oh, shit. 
[01:13:00]  So...  Nothing.  He said, I'm not allowed to have a stereo in the apartment.  So he...  So...  But the point is, is like, dude, it's gone at light speed.  And this is what we were talking about in the bar that night.  It's the...  To me, it's the government going, if we allow this to happen, they will do it to themselves.  They will do it to themselves.  If we put a camera in everybody's hand, they'll just tape themselves.  But was it that calculated on the part of the ominous government? 
[01:13:30]  They can...  I don't think it was.  They can monitor your email.  Mm-hmm.  They can monitor your email.  All of your email now is routed through a device in your pocket.  Yeah.  It's in your pocket.  It's amazing.  I know.  Right?  All that info.  Okay.  So if they can monitor your email, there's no way they're not fucking monitoring your Twitter,  your Facebook, and your hipster photogram, or whatever it's called.  I don't think they're doing that because they had this grand plan to put that in place. 
[01:14:00]  I think technology got to the point, and when technology takes these steps forward,  they look at it and say, wow, okay, we could use it for this, this, and this.  You know?  I disagree.  I don't think the government comes up with these things.  I just don't find them that smart to do that as a whole, you know?  I disagree.  As a machine.  I disagree, but Rich has a point.  Hold on.  Here's the thing.  Like you say, I mean, you monitor.  Look at your house.  Look at all the cameras you have all over the place. 
[01:14:30]  Love it.  And the thing...  Wait till break, and then we'll order.  What?  Well, Rich, I was just about to finish my order.  I know.  It was working out fine.  We're going to order, too.  Well, order...  I got my shit, motherfucker.  That's why I kept talking, so you could order, and then you started talking, and I was...  He didn't come in the fucking room when you were talking.  You're distracted by a pinwheel, you motherfucker.  We were still yapping.  You selfish.  You were talking to Danny while I was talking to Anthony.  Yeah, we're fine.  And I stretched out my fucking dumb point, like I had something to say. 
[01:15:00]  You can order your stupid sandwich.  Thank you for explaining how advanced technology is.  You took a course to let us know that we can use a fucking iPod.  Now I'm going to order on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  You might as well.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  What do you have?  You're a captain professional over here.  I didn't even realize it is creeping up on half past the hour.  I say that because we do replays.  All right.  I'll wait.  Half past the hour.  But when we get back, I do want to continue talking about some of this technology and the repercussions and whether they're planned or they're just taken advantage of after their inception and introduction into society. 
[01:15:30]  Is this a bumper?  Are you doing a bumper?  No, I'm just kind of trying to remind myself by saying it, not to forget it.  But I'm sure we'll come back and just talk about dicks.  The message board I used to go to says I plug a lot.  So I'm not going to tell you guys that I'm at Marissa's in Trumbull tonight and Mohegan Sun tomorrow at the casino.  Mohegan Sun.  And I'll be there tomorrow. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's nice.  And Marissa's in Trumbull.  I'm not allowed to do that anymore because they say I come in here to plug.  Okay.  Who's they?  Whoever they are.  And the fans do come out.  There's some good.  You were there at Governor's when I was there.  There were some great fans.  Oh, yeah.  That was fun, man.  Can you get to the point?  I'm hungry.  All right.  Really?  What part of the day aren't you?  Okay.  Get the fucking plug out, Rich.  I'm not plugging because I don't want people to say, oh, he comes in to plug.  You know, I come in to hang out.  So if you want, I'm not going to talk about Still Empty Inside on iTunes because every 
[01:16:30]  time I'm in here, the fucking, it bumps up.  It really bumps up.  We'll be back right after these words.  The Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.

Joe DeRosa.  Can you?  Not like you can.  Joe DeRosa can sing.  Thank you.  We've had some drunken karaoke moments, and how come everything is drunken before it? 
[01:21:00]  We've had some drunken hanging out, drunken karaoke, drunken conversations, and I love  the fact that we were talking technology and stuff at the bar that day, and we're drinking,  and it's like, yeah, wow.  Wow, they talk about some deep stuff when they're drinking.  No, that was followed by a fucking two-hour conversation on Indiana Jones and which ones  were good, which ones sucked.  We were yelling at each other like we were discussing, yeah, Israel and Palestine.  I got so... 
[01:21:30]  I had to, if you remember, had to stop the conversation because Bill Schultz from Red  Eye, dear friend of ours, his brother came in, and I love his brother, but his brother...  How do you say I just love somebody?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I love his brother.  What the fuck?  Do you really love him?  I'm hating your heart, Rich.  Yes.  What's the matter with you?  Yes, that's why I come to this fucking radio show.  What's the matter with you?  You really know how to just kill a story, too, you know?  No, I'm just saying the love thing really throws me off. 
[01:22:00]  You just step on it.  I don't...  Just go ahead with your story.  Your fucking ick face that you have.  Fucking love.  I love.  Make me sick.  Wouldn't you fucking Gandhi?  Go ahead and love.  Why don't you tie-dye you as you're telling the story?  Shut up.  You fucking...  You never had a fucking four-year-old child give you a Valentine's card, and he's fucking  criticizing me about love.  Did you hear that schmopsy...  Oh, I know.  It was very fucking...  Oh, my daughter gave me a card and crayon story.  I love my daughter.  Oh, let's see. 
[01:22:30]  Let's give him a hand, everybody.  Let's see.  Don't fucking...  What, do you want a trophy?  That fucking love thing is overrated.  I love his brother.  You barely love him, so how would you love his brother?  For a guy that gets mad when you don't understand the fucking wrong words that he uses all the  time, you're gonna...  You, stupid!  You say things that are wrong, and I go, what are you talking about, Rich?  And then you go, you know what I mean.  Shut up.  Don't fucking...  You get it.  You're really gonna nail me to the wall because I said I love that guy?  Really?  You're gonna hold me to the true definition of this right now?  Yeah, yeah.  So I say you like him. 
[01:23:00]  I don't think he meant, you know, that he loves him in a way he would love a family member.  It's thrown around.  It's like the word racist.  It's thrown around too much.  You know what else is thrown around?  That's fucking...  I tried to get the headphones off.  I tried to get the phones off of that head.  You already threw my glasses again.  Now, Bill Schultz's brother comes in, and you adore him.  I've spent many long hours in a deeply emotional relationship with Bill Schultz's brother. 
[01:23:30]  But his brother comes in, and I really like his brother a lot, but I was getting so mad  at his brother for the way he was arguing with me about that last Indiana Jones movie  that I was like, dude, I can't talk to you about this anymore.  It really got serious.  It's making me angry.  Because he was being so dismissive, and he's going, oh yeah, oh yeah, it looked like he  was wearing a costume.  Oh yeah, it sucked. 
[01:24:00]  And no matter...  It was one of those arguments where no matter what you said, he was just going to go, you're  wrong, it sucked.  Right.  Which is a lot of debates people have, especially in a bar.  You're not changing their mind.  How many of those movies were there?  Four.  And all of them were good.  I remember one where the ball was...  Here we go again.  The rock was coming at them.  That's the first one.  Okay, and then there was one with Sean Connery.  That's the third one.  That's the third one.  The second one's with the short round.  The second one is about your gig in India.  You're right. 
[01:24:30]  Your gig in India, you've got to get the stones back.  If you saw it, it's a great reference, which is what we were doing earlier.  Of course.  And the fourth one did, I have to say, suck ass.  I didn't think it was as good as the other three.  I didn't think it sucked ass.  I thought it was...  I thought it sucked ass.  I was like, all right, for 20-year gap.  There's some things that just don't need to be done, and I don't think that needed to  be done.  You don't need to have this discussion again.  Exactly.  Because this is how it started.  And it went on for two hours, I believe, and just got to the point where it was loud 
[01:25:00]  and slurring.  And I wasn't even there.  Any argument is bad when you're stopping to take shots in the middle of it.  Oh, that's right, because the roast just stops the conversation.  It's like, all right, and then...  Oh, wait a minute.  You want to do shots?  And I'm like, yeah.  Let's do some shots of Jägermeister.  I think that's every debate I ever have.  Hold on a second.  What do you want?  What this dumb fucking useless argument needs is more alcohol delivered quicker to our 
[01:25:30]  brain.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  You're going to sit there, and you're going to tell me that Occupy Wall Street is...  Wait, hold on.  Do you want vodka or whiskey?  Vodka or...  Okay.  Vodka's a pussy drink.  Okay.  No, get me...  What do I want?  What do I want?  Yeah, exactly.  Then the debate just turns into, what are we drinking?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just a bad way to debate with somebody.  Oh, drunks, Rich.  They've changed since you were, you know...  Well, hand...  Since you were fun. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, since you were fun.  Hands down, Godfather 3 was the best.  Yee.  I like Godfather 3.  I don't think it sucks.  Oh, God.  George Hamilton?  It fucking stunk.  Your sequel suck guy.  I know.  It's not their fault that Duval wouldn't do the movie.  It's fucking...  Ghostbusters is coming out.  They're remaking Ghostbusters.  It doesn't look like it's going to happen now because Bill Murray said he's not going  to do it.  And isn't there a Top Gun sequel coming out, too?  Like, which seems pretty useless.  Look at this. 
[01:26:30]  I don't know.  Why would that?  I never saw the original.  No?  It's very gay.  It's very homo-rotic.  Kelly McGillis.  What about her?  Hot back in the day.  I can't look at Kelly McGillis in Top Gun now because I've seen her in one of my...  One of my friend's movies, The Innkeepers.  She's in that.  Ty West directed.  She looks very different now.  She looks...  She's older.  Old.  She looks fucking old.  And when you see, like, Tom Cruise at the Oscars and realize, like, they were in the  movie as each other's love interest, and now you look at her now and look at Tom Cruise 
[01:27:00]  now, Tom Cruise is sucking the blood out of small children to stay young.  I believe that's what he's doing.  He is the vampire, Lestat.  Yes.  Nosferatu.  Oh, Lestat.  Right, right.  He is.  He's really that guy.  He doesn't get old, man.  No, no.  And when you look at people that he's acted with around him, I mean, look at Iceman from  fucking Top Gun.  Anthony Edwards?  Well, look at Anthony Edwards, too. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, Val Kilmer was Iceman.  Val Kilmer?  Oh, my God.  He looks like he was stung by a hornet's nest.  That old guy, yeah.  And Anthony Edwards.  Anthony Edwards went from having a full head of hair to being fucking horseshoe cue ball  bald in, like, a year.  It was done.  He was bald by Revenge of the Nerds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what the fuck happened there, though.  He had hair in Top Gun, and he had hair in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  It was thin, though.  Was it thin? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, it was really, like, thin, receding hair.  It was sad.  I think if you lose your hair, you just fucking lose your hair.  Yeah, well, that's easy for a guy with a full head of hair to say, Rich.  What's the big deal?  It's hair.  Well, you know what?  Because you assume that hair is another part of the plumage that humans have that attract  the female.  And guys that lose their hair feel like they're down a couple of points, because now they're  just relegated to girls that will accept guys with no hair. 
[01:28:30]  Girls don't care about looks.  They care about looks.  They don't.  Not all the time.  And there are things that will offset looks.  Money.  Money.  A sense of humor.  That wears out.  Being held at gunpoint.  Yes.  A hammer.  A hammer.  Yes.  Just little things.  It's the little things the girls really latch onto.  No, but he looks just time cruising.  Like, he looks ridiculous.  Do you think he has hair plugs?  He looks so good.  I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  His face isn't aging.  No, he's not getting those wrinkles.  He probably gets Botox or something.  Dude, it's not work.  It doesn't look Botox-y.  You could tell it's not work.  Meanwhile, Billy Crystal.  Look at this gushing over him like a bunch of homos.  Billy Crystal.  Billy Crystal looks like one of those.  Remember those things you'd buy on the boardwalk?  Those rubber faces with the four finger holes in the back?  That's what Billy Crystal looks like.  I tweeted what he looks like.  He looks like the guy that hijacked the bus in Dirty Harry.  Oh, wow.  That's going back a ways.  Might have to watch that again. 
[01:29:30]  Remember the blonde hair?  Crazy.  Well, I do remember that.  No, but I just laughed so it didn't just hang out there.  So it didn't hang.  I was being a friend.  Otto and George, by the way.  Otto did, from the pig roast that he does, pigroast.com.  He did the news the day after the Oscars where he sits on his picnic table out on his back patio and just him and George, it's just him and George going through the news.  They did a bit on the Oscars. 
[01:30:00]  It's in my Twitter.  It's hilarious.  It's so fucking fun.  Just him and that dummy, and the wind's blowing the pages, and George is yelling at him.  And you realize it's just him and a dummy, and it's hilarious.  The dummy's head.  Like, as he's reading the paper himself, Otto's reading the paper, George's head is moving along with it, and it's so natural.  You don't even realize that he's thinking about it.  It's fucking ventriloquists are weird. 
[01:30:30]  I saw him take the dummy apart once, and it, like, freaked me out.  Yeah, yeah.  It was almost like watching him put a child, like, into a suitcase.  This is weird.  Dismembering a child, yeah.  I worked with a ventriloquist who just passed away.  I worked with him on the road, and we were going into our hotel rooms, and I went to his hotel, and he's putting the dummy's clothes in another dresser drawer.  Oh, wow.  Like, it was fucking creepy.  He unpacked the dummy clothes.  And put them in, like, it's separate. 
[01:31:00]  And I remember I was with Otto one time, and he said, you know what George thought of?  I'm like, whoa.  That's weird.  You know.  They're fucking, they're a whole different type of person.  It's the most, uh.  But he's the best.  When you go to see any ventriloquist, hands down, Otto's the fucking.  He's great.  He's the best.  You absolutely accept, even though, I mean, and it's been said before, and even Otto admits to it, he's not the best ventriloquist. 
[01:31:30]  It doesn't matter.  His lips are moving and everything.  But it's a tribute to how good he is, the fact that you, the second you see him, you have no problem differentiating the dummy from him.  It's two different fucking personalities.  It's a, um, he, he's a true innovator of that craft.  Yeah.  And he deserves, he deserves more attention and credit than he's gotten, I believe.  And it's not to understate anything he's done, I just mean, he should be in the history books of ventriloquism in comedy. 
[01:32:00]  But he's filthy, that's what it is.  Well, it's, but it's like, look, for a guy to, I've never, he's the only guy I've ever seen do it, and, uh, for a guy to sit there and have the dummy do the inner monologue.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  For he's, when he's sitting there, like, sweating and bombing, and the dummy is going, what are you, nervous, you fucking pussy?  You make me sick.  You're like, you forget, you're like, wait a minute, he's saying that to himself right now.  He's saying it, yeah.  And he's gotta calm, calm the dummy down, he's like tugging on his clothes, like, okay, okay, George. 
[01:32:30]  And he's very subdued, like, oh, now, come on, be nice to the people, fuck them, fuck them all.  And it's like, wow, no, that's him, holy shit, that's him saying that.  Yeah, it's, it's, the, the funniest thing I ever saw him do, I was at Caroline's watching him, and there's like this 300 pound Italian guy right in the front row, and he's wearing a suit, he's wearing a sport coat. 
[01:33:00]  But this guy's just a monster, right?  And Otto's talking, and halfway through him talking, the dummy just turns its head and looks at the fat Italian guy and goes, Jesus Christ, what size is that jacket, you fucking zilch?  Just out of nowhere.  Just out of nowhere, it was so mean and so funny.  I was laughing so hard.  Yeah, he's fucking great, but he had something up there last night that was, again, very, very fucking funny. 
[01:33:30]  I'm on, I'm on the Twitter a lot at night, and I don't know if it's good or bad, and then people are always like, it's the same shit, you know, are you still up?  You got a show to do tomorrow.  It's like, it doesn't matter if I go to bed at fucking 9.30 or, or 2.30 in the morning, I'm not going to want to get up.  I'm going to be miserable when I'm fucking getting out of bed and driving in, but then you get here and do the show.  So leave me alone when it comes to that. 
[01:34:00]  And they always ask, well, what are you drinking tonight?  And I usually have to tell them because I am usually drinking something.  Last night was wine.  And then I've noticed this, too.  I don't like drinking wine up until like 11 at night because then you go, you go to bed and you wake up and you're feeling kind of hungover.  So I've started drinking a little earlier in the day.  Jesus Christ.  These are the signs.  These are the early signs.  Well, no, these have been signs.  But it works out better if I crack a bottle of wine at like 5 in the afternoon. 
[01:34:30]  Do you and your girl sit like each in a tub drinking wine like in the Cialis commercial looking at the sunset?  What are you implying?  I got a limp fucking noodle?  My rod gets hard.  Jesus.  No, but if you crack the bottle at 5, then you're done with it by like 9.  And the trick is not to open another bottle.  Because you said the addict to the alcoholic. 
[01:35:00]  Exactly.  That is the trick.  Anthony just, he's such an old drunk.  I just had a vision of you pouring Octavia into your fucking wine.  I got to stay regular.  Yeah.  A little Metamucil in there.  Yeah.  It gives it an orange flavor.  That's fantastic.  No, but see, that's the reason I'm not coming in here and puking or having to run to the bathroom with the shits or anything or woozy from being hungover is because you start at 5, you finish up by 9, and then you don't grab that second bottle. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, I mean, it's just proper planning.  It's not alcoholism.  It's just proper planning.  So alcoholism would be going back downstairs, getting another bottle of wine at 9, and drinking that until 11, and now having had two bottles of wine, and it's 11 o'clock, and now you're really going to feel like shit.  It's not like you're drinking in the morning.  You don't have a problem. 
[01:36:00]  No, I know.  Exactly.  It's not like you've got a bottle over there in the desk drawer.  Exactly.  That's what it is.  Thank you, Joe.  You're fine.  That's what I want.  Your acceptance as far as my drinking goes.  And I have given you that in spades.  Yes.  Exactly.  I dare you use that language here on this show.  I must feel racist when any time I hear that, I just think horribly racist things.  And you ring a bell?  Well, that's so the listeners know whenever I hear that.  That's to get his butler here.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Is that to call Rochester in here? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, Rochester.  No, the bell is, it's been, a lot of people have asked what the bell is.  I might as well fill them out.  The bell is, everybody knows that when an obvious racist joke is ready to be thrown out, I just have to do this, and people know that I was going to say the punchline, but to save my job, I don't have to say it.  But now they know.  I see.  See?  Now I get it.  It's like, you know, oh, you say the beginning part, you don't say the punchline.  I see. 
[01:37:00]  Then you do that.  Oh, wait.  That Twitter girl.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry.  No, no.  What's her name?  We were just talking about Twitter.  Are you still listening?  Baby doll?  Is that her name?  This is my stupid phone.  Baby doll.  Hold on.  Baby doll.  Baby doll.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody named Baby doll.  That's her screen name.  Just started following me.  I'm assuming because of the show.  Well, obviously now she knows you fuck a lot of people, thanks to Rich Voss.  Thanks, Rich.  See what happens? 
[01:37:30]  It's Rich.  I talk about him, and he gets a picture of a beaten down pussy sent to him that looks like a tetherball.  Her handle is, that's not bad to give away somebody's handle, right?  Is that privacy?  Our listeners will just put nice things for her to read, I'm sure.  Look, your screen name is Baby doll, and your handle has the word gun in it.  Oh.  There you go.  That's discreet enough.  You must know who I'm talking about.  What do you mean handle?  Can you email me a picture of your face?  Because I love your twit picture. 
[01:38:00]  Which is just her breasts, right?  Just her titties?  Yes.  Mom and dad, if you're still listening, I'm sorry.  Oh.  I'm sorry that you have to hear this.  You're just trying to pick up a girl on the internet?  Nothing bad.  Nothing creepy.  Nothing creepy soliciting a girl that sent you tits pictures so you could see her face.  It's nothing bad.  Not too creepy.  Ooh.  She didn't send me...  She didn't send me tits pictures.  It's her picture.  It's her public picture.  Of course it is. 
[01:38:30]  Anyway.  It's fine.  Will you email me a picture?  Go to my website, JoeDeRosaComedy.com, and then email me through that a picture.  My email's on there under contact.  With a newspaper in your hand so we know what date it was taken.  Like a hostage.  Yeah.  Actually, my email's JoeDeRosaComedy at Gmail, so just email me there, and I want to see  your face.  Oh, you know how many people are going to email you pictures, though, that are like, oh, here  I am, and then you open the picture and it's just some fucking disaster. 
[01:39:00]  Well, now that you said that, I'm sure that's exactly what's going to happen.  Believe me, they know.  Yeah.  I gave up my password within three minutes.  Oh.  Every fucking gay site and everything.  Listen.  When you gave out your password.  My email's on my website.  It's not my email.  It's not a secret.  Yeah.  It sure isn't now.  Oh.  Asshole.  Oh, we were being nice to each other, too.  You're right.  He's not been nice.  Happened.  Hey, baby.  So I know it's you.  Put your full Twitter handle in the email. 
[01:39:30]  Oh.  Because only she'll know that.  How hot do you think a girl is?  Right.  Well, I didn't give it away.  And if you type baby doll in the search, she doesn't come up.  Oh, okay.  So.  She's hot.  I mean, how hot is a girl that won't send a picture of her face but her fucking box?  Hot enough.  She didn't send a picture of either.  Hot enough.  Her profile.  It's her Twitter profile picture.  That's what I mean.  It's just.  Who puts up their Twitter profile picture?  Well, if I had boobs like that, that would be my picture.  And a vagina.  I'll tell you.  That's not her profile picture.  We don't have proof that that was her vagina. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's true.  It looks like a black girl's vagina.  You can't dust for vagina.  What's that mean?  It was from Spinal Tap.  You can't dust?  Dust for vomit.  Oh, I told it was from Washa.  Just some bad fucking gray.  Thank you.  Is that any English accent?  Yeah.  Remind me to check my email a little bit to see if she did it or not.  Don't you worry.  We'll remind you.  Speaking of you and girls, Joe DeRosa, I hear tell on your wonderful podcast that you do with Bobby Kelly that you had a little run-in with a lady friend that you went out on a date with. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  And it went horribly wrong.  Horribly, horribly wrong.  Bobby's podcast, You Know What, Dude?  You Know What, Dude?  Yeah, I'm on it a lot.  And I was on one day and his friend Kathy was on, who used to be his assistant, I guess. 
[01:41:00]  Bobby needs an assistant?  Apparently.  What?  That's a big sandwich of all of you.  Yeah.  Could you assist me with this?  Oh, God damn it.  That's the...  All right.  So, anyway.  Who's that?  What do you think, Joe?  Is that Baby Doll?  Oh, she's good looking.  I can't see her face from here.  Too blurry.  Oh, I just shit myself.  How do you know that's her?  Well, it's...  We have a crack staff here at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Also, it's the background picture is that picture. 
[01:41:30]  The tits.  Yeah, but couldn't that just be a picture?  And it looks like her tits.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, send me a picture like that.  Well, she's...  Where is she?  Is that a pole she's dancing next to?  No, you know what?  I think it's like a split mirrored sliding thing.  Oh, okay.  Right.  She's in the mirror.  All right.  I want to see a clearer picture.  It's just her in a bra and panties.  They're closing this fucking place up like it's goddamn Fort Knox. 
[01:42:00]  Are they serious?  Oh, believe me.  Yeah, they're serious.  All right.  Anyway, so Bobby's...  She used to work with Bobby.  In fact, she used to work for my manager years ago.  Gets around?  Okay.  So we got into...  We were on together one day.  We got into a bit of an argument on the podcast.  And then...  Good natured or...  It got heated, but yeah, we were friends at the end.  What was the topic?  Um, she was telling us how she was...  Indiana Jones 4?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:42:30]  She was...  It was...  I ran in Israel.  So anyway, we just got in this heated debate about something, and she said...  And I was calling her a gold digger, basically, and we were arguing.  But then we made up, and we said we were going to go out on a date, and Bobby said, I want  to see this happen, because you guys are definitely clashing personalities, and neither of you  was going to back down from a fight.  Oh, he saw it.  So we went out on a date, and we promised to do the recap on the show, but we went out  on a date thinking, like, this might actually just be fine, because we're both kind of opinion 
[01:43:00]  or whatever, and it could not have gone worse.  So last episode, our last episode went up on Monday, and it was the follow-up recap date  episode, and things got a little...  Was she there?  Let's just say...  Yes.  Kathy and I are both there, and let's just say we are not friends anymore.  Wow.  It got...  It was that bad.  One fucking date, you get that type of...  It is...  It is nuts. 
[01:43:30]  Animosity.  There was such a clash of ethics.  Ethics.  That's the only way I could describe it.  I was ethically offended by her.  I was listening to this in the back, cutting it up, and it was tough to actually cut up,  because the argument and the points that are going back and forth, it goes on for so  long, it would be trying to cut deliberation from a three-month trial.  Yeah.  Like, there was so much going back and forth, it was impossible to grab any one thing to  dissect.  It's like trying to edit Costner's closing scene in JFK. 
[01:44:00]  But there are instances, like, you could hear where at first it's like recapping, and  then as the clips kind of progress, like, Joe gets increasingly more and more angry.  Oh, yeah.  There's a few instances of agitation in these clips.  That's great.  Okay, good.  So I haven't heard these clips.  All right.  So I don't know.  I guess we'll start with the first one.  I'm going to listen to this.  Sounds like a good place.  I'll go with everything so far, except the dress thing. 
[01:44:30]  I wasn't dressed too nice.  I was dressed the way you dress when you go out to take a girl out to a fucking restaurant  for dinner.  Okay.  She was made...  That already sounds a little heated.  Fucking...  You throw on the word fucking in there.  She made up...  The first time we met on the...  Not met on the...  But the first episode of the podcast where this all got established, whatever.  The first episode of this arc.  She had said something about, like, that I didn't put any money or time into my outfit,  like, that I was wearing that day.  And she really did this dismissive, like, what did you spend on this? 
[01:45:00]  $50?  And was that on the date, or was that on the recap?  It was on the setup episode for the date.  Oh, the setup episode.  We said we were going to...  The episode where we said we are going to go out.  All right.  So she critiqued your clothes during that.  Yeah.  So you went on the date thinking...  I thought, I'll show her that I know how to dress.  Right.  So I put on a sweater and some nice jeans and some boots, and I wore a sport coat over  the sweater.  Jesus.  Right?  Sounds like a sport coat.  A blazer! 
[01:45:30]  A blazer.  It's like you're a professor at a Boston College.  A blazer.  A blazer.  A blazer.  All right.  So that's what I'm referring to.  And she kept saying I was wearing a suit.  And I'm like, I wasn't wearing a suit.  It was dressed up.  So anyway, that's what this is.  Right?  We're on for dinner.  Okay.  Okay.  So did you get that?  That makes sense.  Absolutely, Joe.  That was for you.  Yes.  And there are many girls that like a nice sports coat.  Like, I'm a jean-  Casual.  Casual sports jacket.  I don't like guys too dressed up.  I like the one I wore to the fucking date because I'm like a casual kind of gal. 
[01:46:00]  Well, that's funny because that's not what you said the other day.  No, that's absolutely true.  No, it's not.  I don't like a guy wearing a suit or a sports coat.  I like a good pair of diesel jeans and a t-shirt.  And I quote, Bob, you were here and I quote, a guy should pick up the entire check on a  date because I spent, because I, I'm going to tell you because it's your quote, because  I went out and spent $150 to get a nice outfit and some makeup so I could look great for him. 
[01:46:30]  That is what she said.  She didn't fucking say, I like to show up in jeans and a t-shirt.  I like a casual.  If she would have said that, I would have taken her to fucking Lucky Burger and not  a sit down fucking $130 fucking meal.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And that's the first clip.  That's the beginning.  Holy shit.  Right there.  You could tell this is not going well.  This is like the beginning of Pulp Fiction. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  Wait a second.  Jesus, they're starting it with this robbery thing.  I love you, honey bunny.  Any of you fucking pissed me off.  I've never listened to this.  I haven't even heard this yet.  She said the day before, look how you're dressed and then you get dressed nice and she  said, I like the guy.  Exactly.  That's bullshit.  Fucking crazy.  That's bullshit.  Exactly.  And now this is, this is, the only other thing I'll say about that clip is that contradiction  in, in, in, in expression or whatever you want to call it, her illogical, whatever, that, 
[01:47:30]  that is the theme now that is going to keep repeating where you're going to see she, she  says things that she doesn't understand what their meaning and she contradicts herself  consistently.  Is she hot?  Yeah.  She's, she's an attractive lady.  Would you consider yourself diplomatic, Joe?  You know what?  Honestly, Anthony, I would, I would, but what I, what I fail at, and I will be the first 
[01:48:00]  one to admit this.  Uh, yeah, what I fail at is, is I lose, I expect too much out of people.  And when I expect, when I, you know, it's not, that sounds stupid to say, I don't expect  too much out of people.  I can't understand when someone doesn't act what I define as rational or logical or whatever  or ethical.  And when they don't act that way, I start to lose my sense of diplomacy and I start to 
[01:48:30]  get very angry.  So you get angry at every girl in the world.  You have a good vocabulary.  That's pretty much.  Most people.  You know that?  You have a good vocabulary.  You do have a good vocabulary.  I have a lousy vocabulary.  No, you have a good one.  But thank you.  Well, it's based on.  Because I said diplomacy.  But it's based on Rich, so.  It's, I'm, I'm very impressed.  Yeah.  Thank you, Rich.  I'm very fucking impressed.  That fucking community college worked for you.  Oh, God.  I'm impressed.  I'm impressed.  It's just such an obvious setup, Rich.  I know it.  I'm impressed.  It bothers me that you think I don't see it coming. 
[01:49:00]  I'm not.  I'm telling you, I'm impressed by your college.  Who cares?  You have a good vocabulary.  Thank you.  That's all I'm saying.  I can't compliment you.  Maybe, maybe, maybe she is right.  You can't take a compliment.  Oh, God.  But you can take the steam out of something by complimenting you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Next, next clip now.  Obviously, things off to a bad start.  That was the first one.  Let's hear how this goes.  The argument isn't don't order whatever you want. 
[01:49:30]  What is the argument?  The argument is when you order whatever you want and then go tough shit.  I put in my effort because I took a cab over here and I'm a fucking black hole on the date.  She said, this is because I was angry that she acted so entitled to this whole thing.  Like, I just owed her this, like, big deal.  I don't give a fuck what you spent.  I'm a lady.  I deserve this.  And she actually said at one point, I go, what effort did you put into this besides just showing up? 
[01:50:00]  Just showing up.  Yeah.  She goes, I put effort in.  I took a cab over here.  She actually said that.  So now we're talking about, she was giving me shit about, like, really?  You're going to be cheap and bitch about the bill and da-da-da-da.  And I'm saying, no.  No, I'm not.  But I go, the argument isn't you can't order what you want.  The argument is I spent this money and then you brought absolutely nothing to the table to deserve that.  Right.  So that's what this is right here.  Black hole on the date.  And then deal with it. 
[01:50:30]  Don't talk about a vagina like that.  I want to talk about a rascal.  Okay, but that's his story.  But the way I see it, Joe, is that you could order what you want, but if you know, like, halfway through you're not interested, like, maybe, like, you know, all bets are off.  Like, it's like, just because things didn't go your way and I didn't want to go back to your house, when you take a girl out on a date, it's like a fucking gamble.  And you lost.  You put money down and, like, it didn't go your way.  And that's what you, that's the risk you take.  Black 17.  I don't have to do anything at the end of a date.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:51:00]  I didn't say you had to do anything, Kathy.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  When you realized I wasn't going back to your house, everything was, everything changed.  No, Kathy, when you ripped the phone out of my hands and acted like a fucking asshole and I said apologize and you wouldn't, that's when everything changed.  Joe, Joe, Joe.  Okay.  She, at one point, she was being really shitty to me, so I texted Bobby and I wrote, I wrote, hey, dude, she's a real fucking asshole.  And she goes, who are you texting?  Who are you texting?  And I went, texting Bobby.  She goes, what are you writing?  What are you writing about me?  And I was like, none of your business. 
[01:51:30]  And she goes, let me see, Lisa.  I go, no.  And she jumped over the table and physically ripped the phone out of my head.  Holy shit.  All you had to do was go like that.  No, I actually, when we were on the podcast, I showed Bobby and Dan, like, how she did it.  And when I showed them, they were like, Jesus Christ, seriously?  It's a little aggressive.  And I said to her, I go, if you were a guy and you just did that, we'd be fighting right  now.  Yeah, yeah.  We'd be fighting.  And she's like, I'm not a guy.  Deal with it.  Deal with it.  And that's when things took a hard left, where I was like, you're a fucking asshole, and now 
[01:52:00]  you want to send this thing into the ground?  I'll send it into the fucking ground.  So that's when the date really got nasty and brought us to this point of being in this  energy at the recap of it.  But that's the phone reference.  Was that it for that clip?  Yeah.  Okay, this is next clip.  I don't want to over-explain everything.  She's such a fucking prude.  Hang on.  Take your dick down.  Hold on.  Keep it going.  She's a prude.  She's not a prude.  She's absolutely fucking prude.  She wouldn't even, she barely was, like, she didn't want to come into my house. 
[01:52:30]  She was like, I can't come into your house.  It's a bad idea.  It's called being uninterested, Joe.  Not prude.  Then why did you go out with me, Kathy?  For the podcast.  You fucking gold-digging asshole.  Then why did you go out with me?  For Twitter followers?  Taffy, congratulations.  You're Twitter followers.  You're not getting any because everybody's going to be on my side, Taffy.  You look like a fucking asshole right now.  She definitely is an asshole, but it's very funny. 
[01:53:00]  Wow.  Yeah, so she does this whole, let me explain what that meant, too, about not going to my  house.  It wasn't about going into my house to fuck around.  Although that would be nice if a girl does that.  Well, I wasn't even referring to that.  I was referring to at the beginning of the date, I said, just meet me at my place.  And she goes, I'm not coming into your place.  And she does, which is fine, but she does this whole thing where she's like, I'm a wild  girl.  I don't give a fuck.  I'll say whatever.  Oh, one of those.  I'm adventurous.  I'll do anything at any time. 
[01:53:30]  And then you go, but you won't walk into my apartment?  I actually said to her on the day, I go, what do you think?  I have a net hanging over the door that I'm going to drop on you?  I'm like, what do you think is going to happen by walking into my apartment?  You psycho, you're a psycho.  So, uh, so that's why I was saying she's a prude.  Like she acts like she's this wild gal.  Like meanwhile, she thinks it's like, yeah, but a lot of girls don't want to go into somebody's  place.  I can see.  At the beginning of a date?  I know you're not going to do anything.  I know.  Listen, I know you, but a lot of girls feel uncomfortable just putting themselves in that position. 
[01:54:00]  That's another one of the games, but that's bullshit games that they play.  That's fine.  But if you're going to do that, then if you're going to talk the talk, then walk the walk.  She took her cab.  No.  God damn it, Rich.  If we're out with you, girl.  But don't tell me she's wild.  Don't say I'm wild and then you go, but you won't even walk in.  What the fuck are you talking about?  No, if we're out with you, if we're out with you, we do want to fuck you. 
[01:54:30]  If we're out with you in any capacity, dinner, hanging out, movie, we do want to fuck you.  Right.  That's just the way it is.  That's not true.  I go out with my wife all the time.  Oh, boy.  So, all right.  It's not saying you can't have a good time during the time that we have to do stuff before  we might fuck, but we do in the end want to have sex.  Well, of course.  Listen, of course, every guy wants to do that every time, all the time with every girl  that he ever looks at. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  But I just, you know, I don't, I have no problem with, I just can't, again, now we're starting  to get into like, are you diplomatic?  When somebody acts irrationally or illogically, it drives me crazy.  So I just couldn't stand the fact that she was saying, I'm so much fun and I'm so spontaneous,  yet at the beginning of a date, when we have dinner reservations, you won't, what is going  to happen from walking?  I don't even understand. 
[01:55:30]  Like, I can't even compute what the downside of that is.  Okay, but clearly this date to her is a bit.  Did you look at this date, anything else than a bit?  Do you know what I mean?  Like, she's doing it for the podcast.  Were you doing it out of, maybe there can be romance?  As I, no, no, no.  I went out with her and, and as I said to her several times through the podcast, if you're  going to, I go, listen, if you want to do it for a bit, that's fine, but then chip in  and be part of it, which she didn't. 
[01:56:00]  And we're, these, it's going to get into that.  It's going to, well, you'll hear that.  It's going to get into the money argument.  All right.  Let's listen to another, another clip from this wonderful date.  What's her name again?  Kathy.  Kathy, Joe and, Joe and Kathy.  Remember when she said on the podcast last week, what, Kathy, what are the chances of  Joe's getting the cock touch tonight?  I don't remember last week's podcast.  Zero percent.  Zero percent.  She said it on the podcast.  Yeah, your cock touch is a lot different than making out with somebody. 
[01:56:30]  But here's the deal, Joe.  You said you never make out on the first date.  Those are your exact.  I said I rarely make out on the first date.  No, you said never, Kathy.  Yeah, but what we're saying.  But I have, Joe.  Well, then you, then you're a liar.  No, I, I kind of lied to you there.  I felt bad.  Like, what do I say?  Sometimes I do, but I don't like you to your face.  It's fucking weird.  Yeah, be a fucking grown up.  Take out 60 beans.  Put it on the fucking bill.  And take your fucking lumps.  Absolutely not.  Are you out of here?  Exactly.  Hang on one second.  I can't even, I can't, I hate her so fucking much.  You don't take, you don't take the headphones off.  I won't. 
[01:57:00]  You don't push the mic away.  I hate her so much.  Then I win.  No, you don't win.  You're a fucking asshole.  As a bailiff.  Order in the court.  I win.  You're an asshole.  As a bailiff, I'm breaking this up.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I pushed the fucking mic aside and took my headphones off.  I was, I was getting so mad.  Yeah, you were angry right there.  It's real.  I mean, this is the thing.  It's like, what do you do in a situation like that?  When a woman makes you that mad, if a guy made you that mad, you'd be like, dude, we're  going to fight.  We're going to fucking fight.  When a woman makes you that mad, it can't go there. 
[01:57:30]  And you're like, I have to walk out of this room right now.  You totally nail her with, you know, you said you don't kiss on the first date.  Right.  And then she has to fucking dig it in with you by saying, no, I do, but just not you.  And, uh, you know, that's, that's a direct jab at you.  And that, well, it is a jab.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  It is a jab.  And I didn't appreciate it, but she, that's my point with this shit is that she says she  just is a walking contradiction.  Yeah. 
[01:58:00]  She sits there and goes, I never do this.  And then she goes, well, I lied.  And then you go, then say you're a liar.  Then say I'm a liar.  Then she goes, I don't have to say I'm a liar.  I'm not a liar.  And then she pities you like, oh no, I felt bad for you.  It's like, really?  I need your pity that you're not going to fucking kiss me.  Fuck this bitch.  And she really made it like, she started to really make it like, you're mad that I won't  make a, I'm like, I'm not mad that I won't make, I don't care about that.  I go, I am just calling this for what it is now because you leapt over a table and physically 
[01:58:30]  attacked me and then acted like I had to just deal with it because you're a chick.  Okay, you want me to just deal with your shittiness of being a chick?  Then you're going to deal with my shittiness of just being a guy.  Put out or give me money.  Wait, wait.  That's it.  She attacked you or took your phone?  She ripped my phone out of my hand.  Dude, I'll show you what she did.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  It's a demonstration.  Give me your phone.  It's like a courtroom now. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  All right, if we could have the defendant.  You want to know what an attack is?  What Israel's going to do to Iran?  Oh, God.  Let me see.  Let me see this.  Baby doll, email me.  Here.  Oh.  I'm texting Bob.  Now, I want you to, when I try to grab it, I want you to not give it.  Like, you know, don't give.  And I'm going to show you exactly what she did.  Okay.  All right, ready?  She's holding the phone.  Oh.  I want to grab it and jam this finger on the microphone.  Did she hit her hand on the restaurant microphone? 
[01:59:30]  No, don't switch to it.  Grab the phone, Rich.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  He hurt himself on the mic.  God damn it.  I hate to be the guy you get in a fight with.  Fuck it.  What is this, Charlie Brown?  All right, ready?  Jesus Christ.  Okay.  She went like this.  She went, ah.  Wow.  Wow.  Literally, like, I swear to God, that aggressive.  And you let her take it out of your hand?  No, I wouldn't.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I meant by don't let me take it. 
[02:00:00]  I wouldn't let her take it.  But with that force, as I was resisting.  And I was like, you know what?  And I wasn't saying I'm going to call this for what it is, meaning this is what I want  is for you to give me some ass.  I didn't mean it like that.  I was like, if you want to act like an asshole, then I'm going to reduce this to the most insulting  thing I possibly can now.  You're a fucking asshole, and I'm going to tell you that.  And I'm going to insult you by saying, then pay for half the day or beat it. 
[02:00:30]  Because at that point, her company was useless.  Everything was useless, except for the fact that, you know, she might give you a blowjob  or something.  That wasn't going to happen.  They hate each other.  I know.  But I knew that wasn't going to happen.  But he laid it out there like, okay, I'm a piece of shit?  No.  How about this?  You didn't fuck me.  You should give me money for dinner, because that's all you're worth.  Yeah.  It was my...  Your company wasn't even worth half the price of dinner.  It was an...  Exactly.  It was an insult thing. 
[02:01:00]  But she never understood that.  And she kept going, you were just mad, though.  It wasn't me.  And it's like, no, stupid.  Oh, God.  Do you not get it?  This is infuriating.  Yeah.  I'm getting fucking angry right now.  I'm thinking about it again.  Could you have snuck out at a restaurant and left her with a bill?  God, Rich.  That would have been...  I don't know.  Why didn't I do that, Rich?  That would have been fucking great.  We did it to Keith one night.  We do it.  Because you know what?  My jacket was at the table.  You put it on.  I got to go to the bathroom.  And you fucking just leave her there.  She'll know.  She'll go, you better not fucking leave. 
[02:01:30]  I wish...  You know what?  I wish...  That is a good one.  I wish you didn't say that on the air.  So I could have said, let's do a recap.  One more time.  Let's try one more thing.  You can.  She's not listening.  You're right.  According to Rich, no one's listening.  No, I didn't say that.  Listen.  Anybody listening to the show right now, please do me a favor.  And I mean this.  Don't tweet anything about what Rich just said.  Because if you really care and want to see something mean happen, let me try to set up this date where I walk out on the check. 
[02:02:00]  Please don't blow up the spot on this.  Find a restaurant where there's a bathroom that you can get out without her seeing you.  Like, let's go in.  You know what I mean?  And expensive.  You know, a nice place and just fucking leave.  Yeah.  I'll leave before the food even comes out.  Others do.  No, no.  Eat the food.  Get your food.  She won't know.  No, I don't care.  I suspect that.  Exactly.  No, you got to have the food come out.  So it has to be paid for.  Have it come out.  Take a bite.  Take one bite.  So she'll go, oh, he's not running out until he eats. 
[02:02:30]  Take a bite or two.  Go to the bathroom.  Oh, you got to have a few drinks.  You know.  Like the way you think, Kuvia.  Yeah, yeah.  Your drinks.  All right, all right.  Skedaddle.  Yeah, guys, don't blow up the spot on this, man.  This is too good.  We got to make this happen.  And then I'll report back on this show as well as the podcast.  Okay, any more clips?  We got two more.  Yeah, let's hear the next one.  This is painful.  Kathy, I don't want you to give a shit about me. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  But you're making this.  You're making this.  Why would I feel pity for it?  Why would I feel anything for someone that's right at me about everything?  I'm not asking you to, Kathy, but open your ears instead of your mouth for once and listen to what I'm saying.  I don't care.  I don't care if you feel.  No, this is her only response is to talk over you and go, you're pathetic.  This is my point, Kathy.  I don't care if I have an effect on you or not.  I said 20 minutes ago.  Well, you don't.  Do you see what I mean?  I said 20 minutes ago that it's a weakness in me that I let the shortcomings of other people get me this riled up. 
[02:03:30]  What bothers me about you is that when I say to you, Kathy, what you did was fucking offensive.  And I'm not talking about the making out.  I'm not talking about any of that stuff.  Bottom line, Joe, what did I do that is offensive?  I didn't because I didn't like you at the end of the day.  I should pay for it.  Is that what you you're like?  Any girl.  If you make statements like girl, you make what did I do?  That was so offensive.  When you make statements like I did this just for the podcast, just like you did.  I have that on tape.  OK, let me finish. 
[02:04:00]  This is the one.  Let me finish.  Podcast.  Let me finish.  That's what you said on the day.  I know I said it.  Let me finish.  I said, when you say things like I did this for the podcast just like you did.  And you say things like I feel bad about the money you had to spend.  And you say things like we knew this was a joke from the beginning.  Then fucking take half of the hit and spend for half of the fucking day.  That wasn't the.  I never would go out with a guy that I'm going to take for half of the hit.  Then you're just a fucking asshole then.  No, I'm not. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, God.  She wound you up, man.  Damn, you were pissed.  Yeah, I was really upset.  You're yelling.  I was really upset.  You're yelling at her.  I hate her.  And saying, fuck, well, that's apparent.  I hate her guts.  I think she's a terrible person.  See, I understand your anger.  And I'm angry just listening to this.  But I don't think I could do that with a girl.  I can't.  I could get mad. 
[02:05:00]  Believe me.  But I can't bring it out like that with fucking fucking, you know, that's a talent.  That's good.  Like, I'm just thinking like my ex-wife.  Absolutely.  But as far as arguments go, especially something, you know, if you've been in a relationship a while and things are happening and you get into an argument.  Yeah.  But one date evokes such hatred and passion to yell at each other like this.  But you're not a, I mean, or are you? 
[02:05:30]  You're not really a lose-the-temper kind of guy.  No, no.  I really have to be pushed.  He pays Keith to do it.  Yeah, that's it.  Bust some legs.  Ah, he pays Kenny.  Oh, man, you want me to get mad for you?  What force should you want me to do?  So, but I mean, you know what I mean?  Like, I'm a fiery guy.  Like, I get, I have a temper and I get mad at little, I get, the things that make me the most angry are when I can't, when something isn't working the way it's supposed to work. 
[02:06:00]  Like, if my, my, yeah, exactly.  Like, my, which is why, like, in the past I've had to really work on not flipping out on stage.  You know?  Because if I do a joke and I know it works and it's not working, my first tendency is to be like, what the fuck?  Why are you not laughing at this?  That's funny, you motherfuckers.  That probably wouldn't work, though, with the crowd.  Well, you're not likable. 
[02:06:30]  So, you know, that's a big part of it.  That's a big part of it.  But, you know, my CD player, when I used to have one, I had one of those five disc Sony changers.  Oh, braggart.  I know, an aristocrat.  That's what happened.  The, uh, the buttons were all broken off the face of it because it would skip all the time and I punched it once.  I got so mad that I punched it in its face.  No, all the buttons were broken.  I'm going to tell you what to do when you get mad.  And I've said this on the air, like, sometimes if I'm playing golf and I get really mad, just, you, right here, you still see some scars. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, he bites his arm.  Right here, look it, look it.  We've heard about Rich and the way he settles his problems.  It takes a fucking, I'm telling you.  He bites his fucking arm like a mental patient.  But Buddy is listening to the show and he wrote, he just texted, that girl was and remains an awful cunt.  She isn't coming across very well and especially talking over you.  Oh, the Twitter's popping.  If she let you talk and was civil during this and you were like you are in this conversation, you'd come off looking like a fucking nut. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, I know.  But it's her fucking, like, just talking over you and contradicting herself and denying things.  And the grating voice.  Yes.  Oh, it's pathetic.  It's pathetic.  It's like you entitled, you entitled asshole.  It's just, she sounds like a girl in my super sweet 16.  You know what I mean?  Those bitches.  Yeah, it's just awful. 
[02:08:00]  Now, I guess this is the last clip.  It's where he hits her.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounded like it was gearing up for that.  So the last clip of the recap of the date.  Let's hear this.  You, never in your fucking life, I guarantee it, have had to go out on a date and sacrifice anything up to and including this situation.  I lost a lot on tape.  Shut up now.  Shut up.  Okay?  You told me, you told me, you told me stories in the fucking restaurant about, like, oh, when I used to drink, I would see a guy and I'd go, I'm going to flick my cigarette in his head. 
[02:08:30]  And I'd go, would guys hit you?  Jesus Christ, it's horrible.  She goes, no, they fucking loved it.  Because you're used to putting your tits on display and let your little fucking thong top hang out and getting what you want in the cheapest fucking way possible.  You didn't spend a goddamn dime on that date.  You went out, you ate a fucking meal, you filled your stomach, and you went home.  You don't, and if you did.  That's why I win and you lose. 
[02:09:00]  Kathy.  Dude, get her out of here.  I'm serious.  Wait, wait, wait.  I can't be around this fucking shit.  You don't walk away from the podcast.  I can't be around this shit.  She's such a fucking asshole.  What are you going to do, hit her?  No.  All right, so stop.  You can take it.  You're fine.  You can't take it, obviously.  Joe, it's fine.  It's just a girl with tits.  I don't fucking like her.  I think she's a piece of garbage.  I win.  Holy shit.  Oh, that I win.  Like she played you, got her dinner, gave you nothing, so she wins. 
[02:09:30]  You know what?  If you punch her and then a judge heard that, the judge would say, you know what?  You were right.  I loved, I loved, you got to get her out of here.  Yeah, she goes, I win.  And then there's a pause.  Get her out of here.  Get her out of here.  Get her out of here, Freddy.  Yeah.  Get her out of here.  I fucking, it's, dude, it's, it's, it's, you literally, yeah, you could go in front  of a court, in front of a judge, and he would go, how can you explain?  You would just go, your honor, she was asking for it. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  She was asking for a punch in the fucking jaw.  Listen to this.  She was running her, yeah, and he would go, all right.  When she says, I win, you lose, but in life, she's really such a, you know what I mean?  And, in that situation, oh, wow, you got a free dinner, so you're, you're a winner.  Wow, I got, I say 60 fucking bucks.  What kind of guy, what kind of guy, if not you, would she, like, go out with and, and  enjoy?  I don't, I don't get it.  I, I don't, I don't know.  The jock.  I don't know.  Maybe he's dumb jock. 
[02:10:30]  Maybe he's sitting up straight.  She's, she's.  Jeez, Rich.  Yeah, an insult to injury, Rich.  Yeah.  She, uh, I don't know.  I, I mean, I, I, I, you know what was weird, when I was talking to her on the phone, I  said, uh, to her, I said, um, we were, I called her, and we had these, we made this plan, I  was going to go to her neighborhood, da, da, da, and I called her, I go, look, I have a  really crazy day today, can you just come to my neighborhood, and we'll go out around  here, that way I don't, I can work up until the minute you arrive, I don't. 
[02:11:00]  Makes perfect sense.  Oh, well, that was a 20 minute fucking debate on the phone, where she was, and that's.  I'm not going to debate you, Jerry.  Yeah, that's how this started.  I was like, it's going to be this whole fucking thing, you know?  And she goes, uh, I go, listen, Kathy, just come to my fucking neighborhood, and da, da,  da, da, da, and she goes, okay.  And I was like, you're weird.  I go, that's all I had to do, was say it like that, like an asshole?  Oh.  And she's like, well, maybe you'll learn something about me.  And it's like, oh, you need a guy that's just going to dominate you. 
[02:11:30]  No, that abuses her, that fucking doesn't want her.  She, a guy that's going to-  But that seems to be like Joe.  Like, Joe should have been the love of her life after fucking that.  The abuse, the rejection, the fuck you, the get her out of here.  She should have fucking loved you, if that's the case.  Well, maybe she does want to hook up with me now.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know.  But that wasn't a, I don't think what, I'm not saying this to be defensive, I'm just  saying like, I don't think what I was doing was abusive. 
[02:12:00]  I think it was, we were arguing.  Yeah.  And I don't think that's the kind of, if she is that kind of girl, we're obviously pontificating,  but she's, she would, that she, a girl like that wouldn't respond to that kind of thing.  Yeah.  They would respond to, go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.  I don't, you know what I mean?  Like, they, they respond to a swaggering dismissal.  I kind of found that's what you came off like.  Don't fuck yourself, you piece of shit.  I think you may have said that.  I come off, but I say it like a mad scientist. 
[02:12:30]  You know, she wants it.  Not like the swaggering fucking cool guy piece of shit.  She wants it, James Dean, you know.  James Dean, I don't care about you.  All right.  I'm saying it's Dean Sussing.  Yeah, like Jimmy Dean Sussing.  Go fuck yourself.  So, I mean, you know, she's, but she's just, she's just a fucking asshole of a person.  And it's like, you know, what do you do?  Like I said before, it's, I almost walked out of the room because I was getting so mad  that I was like, you're just like, there's nowhere to go. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  This, I'm a guy, she's a girl.  There's nowhere we can go from here.  You've lost all common ground.  I'm just going to, I'm going to have a fucking heart attack.  How old is she?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I can't scream any more than this.  You know what I mean?  How old is she?  Uh, 44.  Holy shit.  All right.  That changes the whole fucking game plan.  What, what a set of balls on this bitch.  Here we go.  Tick tock, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  If you got a 22 year old pussy on you, you could fucking talk like that. 
[02:13:30]  That 44 year old cactus man should be paying $60.  Exactly.  Okay.  Here, this is a, this is a, I said to her at one point, she goes, she goes, oh, you're  just mad because I didn't bang you.  And I go, I go fucking, I go, I date women in their twenties.  Yeah.  Grass over 30 is brown.  She didn't want to hear that.  And, and, and, and look, you know, as for my many appearances on this fine program, I've  got nothing against an older lady. 
[02:14:00]  Well, of course you've talked in the past about how you would bang older women and have  and whatnot.  But, uh, a girl like that, 44, a woman like that, a hag like that should fucking be a little  more appreciative.  First of all, that anyone's taken her cougar ass out.  Right.  And, and as far as sex goes, she's playing coy like a school girl.  She's never been married.  She should have showed up at the date with her fucking pussy hanging out.  You don't fucking play coy with a 44 year old pussy. 
[02:14:30]  She should have been an armored truck.  Fuck man.  That shit has been off the lot for a while.  Has she been married?  There's city miles on that thing.  I don't think so.  Treat it like a fucking, it's in the showroom.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, wax it.  Stop it.  It is part of what fucking angers you.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It is.  Everybody pile in.  It is a big part of what angers you in a situation like this.  You can't help but sit there and go, I'm 10 years younger than you.  Yeah.  And for what it's worth, have a better career. 
[02:15:00]  Really?  Pussy don't age like fine wine.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's like, it's like I should be sort of a catch to you.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, unless you're going to go find some fucking banker.  Right.  You know what I mean?  That's going to, that's going to shower you with cash.  I think this is a good, you know, if you, if you, if you, if you, we went out, you know,  you got a good chance of maybe getting taken down to Carolines for free.  See?  And at 44, that's a treat. 
[02:15:30]  And I'll introduce you to the middle and headliner.  Oh, damn, what a set of fucking nuts.  I thought she was 23, 24.  That's what I thought.  Some girl in her 20s.  I thought it was some hot little girl.  Playing all right.  Oh, no.  Playing the game.  You can't tell by her voice that she's fucking in her 40s.  Oh, that Lucille Ball fucking.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, Rich.  Yeah.  This fucking Joe DeRosa.  I had a tough day at the factory trying to wrap those chocolates today. 
[02:16:00]  Remember when we made that wine?  Oh, my feet turned purple.  I have to go.  I'm auditioning to take over as Krusty the Clown of the Sixers.  Fuck her then, 44, my ass.  Yeah.  That's fine.  You know, 44.  I'm not even bashing 44-year-old women.  I'm bashing 44-year-old women that come off with their pussy like it's fucking gold. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  That shit's devalued.  That's maybe, maybe some fucking tin.  It's fucking silver pudding.  Yeah, it's like, come on, appreciate that, I guess, that a younger guy.  You know what?  It's not even an idiot.  See, this is the problem.  When you start to argue this, right, it starts to just sound like you're saying, you have  to have sex with me.  And that's not what the argument is.  That is, that's a creepy argument.  And that's not what the argument is.  The argument is, show appreciation. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Show appreciation by acting like a civilized human being and having a little bit of class.  That's it.  Some class.  That's it.  Act morally, ethically, whatever term you want to put on it.  Just don't act like an entitled snatch.  Even if she didn't pay for half dinner, she could have said, hey, let me take you out for  a couple drinks and maybe bought you a drink or two somewhere else.  You know, something, you know, anything.  Yeah.  I told her at dinner, I go, I go, you just lost, because we were doing this, this thing 
[02:17:30]  that we thought was funny.  We were like, well, let's keep points for the podcast.  See who gets more points.  Oh, it started out fun and games.  Yeah.  It started out cute.  It ended, get her the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This started like when you're wrestling with your college roommate as a goof.  And then it turns into a, I wish I went to college, but it eventually turns into the,  you know, the window's broken and there's a hole in the wall because it becomes a fight.  Someone needs stitches. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  So, um, but she, uh, we were doing this points thing and when the check came and I put my  card down, I said, uh, I said, uh, I, you just lost a couple of points.  And she goes, why?  And I go, I go, I go, cause you didn't offer.  You didn't offer to give me any money.  And you didn't lose points for putting a Blockbuster card down?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Good.  Okay.  So that was a bad one.  It was terrible.  It didn't even make sense.  They're all closed.  They're all closed.  Jesus, really?  You can't charge things with a Blockbuster card.  No.  That was a joke. 
[02:18:30]  No, it wasn't.  It would have been funnier if you said Sears card or something.  Or JCPenney.  Okay.  Start over.  The point thing.  Start over.  Dude.  So I put my card down.  You didn't lose points for putting down a Kohl's card?  Kohl's.  That's funny.  A Marshall's.  Yeah.  That's funny.  And then the way your voice cracked it, the lack of confidence in it made it better.  Yeah.  She goes, I go, you lost points.  You didn't offer to pay anything.  And she goes, she got like offended.  And she's like, well, I would never offer to pay.  And I go, listen, I would never take it in a million years. 
[02:19:00]  I go, but when a girl offers, it shows me that she doesn't think it's owed to her.  That's all I'm saying.  Right.  She's a good person.  And she could not wrap her head around that concept.  She was appalled by it.  She just has to show up.  That's all girls need to do like that.  And she goes, she goes, a guy should, she said this on the other, the previous, the setup podcast, not this one.  And she said, a guy should pay for everything and should pick up all the tabs because I'm spending all this money on looking great and whatever. 
[02:19:30]  And she shows up in this like fucking forever 21 outfit.  I told her on this podcast, I go.  Forever 44.  Yeah.  That's a frock.  She looks like Mrs. Roper.  Forever 24.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I go, your outfit looked like, every part of your outfit looked like it came out of like that bin where it's, you know what I mean?  Like the $5.99 bin where it's all just balled up shirts and shit.  I go, everything that you wore didn't need to be ironed. 
[02:20:00]  It was like something you could just wear to the gym if you had to.  You're a fucking bum.  You're a fucking bum.  She's a bum, Rock.  A bum.  Yeah, so it's just, that's what it is.  How did it wrap up?  I mean, you, she went out with, it ended with the setup that she's now going, she's going to go out with Dan Soder, one of the other guys on the podcast, to see how it goes with him. 
[02:20:30]  See if it's you.  And the follow up for that one will be coming soon.  But yeah, they're going to go out.  I'm going to hear that.  They might have already gone out.  Yeah, but does she not get along with Dan on the podcast too?  No, Dan, she was, no, Dan is a real laid back dude.  Yeah.  You know, he's not the kind of controversial guy that you are.  Well, let's see if he's laid back enough that he can take that fucking kind of shit.  Yeah, I mean, so there.  And Dan doesn't have that kind of money to take her out.  Okay.  No.  Well, that's the whole thing.  After the fact, she's going, she's going, you could have taken me to a burger joint. 
[02:21:00]  I didn't care.  Why don't you say so?  Hey, if you don't want to spend that much, I feel bad.  It wasn't about not wanting to spend it.  She didn't get anything.  If you would have taken her a burger joint, I told you it would have hurt.  And he took me to fucking a burger.  You know, you couldn't win in that situation.  If you would have taken her anywhere but a nice place, then you would have fucking lost.  Oh, good fucker.  I was, yeah, and it's funny, I was walking with Bobby the other day, and he's on the  phone with her.  Oh, really?  And he goes, yeah, I'm right here with DeRosa.  Hold on.  And he puts the phone up to my ear, and he goes, Joe, say hi to Kathy.  And I go, no. 
[02:21:30]  And like, because it's like, after that podcast, she was like, let me finish, Rich, for Christ's  sakes.  I'm just throwing in.  Can we not judge every sentence, mister?  I like how he was the one that was fucking upset that it was going to be mean in here today.  I know.  And he's the only one being mean.  He's slamming, yeah.  The only one.  I'm not mean.  I'm just being me.  I'm on your side the whole time.  Are you?  I gave you that great idea, didn't I?  What great idea?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I said you had a good vocabulary, didn't I?  What are you going to do? 
[02:22:00]  Vocabulary.  Vocabulary.  Vocabulary.  You have a good vocabulary.  We really should take a break, though.  Dude, you want to finish up?  I was just, yeah, that was the, I was finished until fucking Richa.  But wait a second.  Stop!  I got a question to ask you about it.  We got to wrap up.  Fuck off.  Do a break.  How come you won't get her on the phone?  How come you don't want to deal with it?  I don't want to talk to her.  But my point is, is like, after that podcast, she was like, Joe, it was all in good fun.  And I was just like, whatever.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't. 
[02:22:30]  Like, I think you're a fucking bad person.  She knows it's not in good fun.  Oh, she said that at the end?  I said it to her multiple times on the podcast.  I don't like her as a human being.  So anyway, that's that.  It's out there now.  You Know What Dude podcast.

[02:24:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  I'd like to say F.U. to the girl who gave me a yeast infection in my throat.  F.U.  Fuck you!  Hi, I want to say fuck you to my husband, because he threw a pack of cigarettes in my face, and I have a little cut in my face, and he's a big dick.  So I just wanted to say fuck you to him, and I hope he drops dead.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a fuck you to Rocky at work, you little bastard, walking around, picking you to shit. 
[02:24:30]  Hope you're choking your own semen, you little bastard.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to Troy Kwan.  Troy, I get you're a DJ, but nobody likes Dubstep.  Stop putting it in your production.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Hey, this fuck you goes out to the guy who fucked my best friend's girlfriend after I told my best friend that you had recovered from your heroin addiction and that you were a good guy,  and then you went and fucking relapsed and fucked his girlfriend of two years. 
[02:25:00]  Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit.  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to whomever Jess lost a bet to, and now she has to marry Sam.  Don't you realize what you're doing to her?  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  I seriously almost blew chunks all over my windshield listening to fucking douchebag Sam talk about his fucking cock and how disgusting it is.  That is fucked up.  I do not want to hear Sam on the radio anymore.  I cannot listen to this turd salad for the rest of the week. 
[02:25:30]  Fuck you, Sam.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a fuck you to myself.  I'm a virgin, and this girl was going to give me a blowjob, and my penis stayed limp.  She tried playing with me, stroking me.  I couldn't get my penis off, and it was humiliating, so fuck you to myself.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to the guy complaining about the girl rubbing up on him.  Obviously, she's not returning your text because you can't be trusted with the secret she was trying to test you with.  You're a fucking bitch. 
[02:26:00]  She wanted to get with you, but you blew it.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Back at ya.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  It's the Anthony Show, my fucking show.  We're going to talk about racism and guns.  Racism and guns are my fucking show.  So don't even bother trying to call in, motherfuckers.  Because Anthony don't take no fucking phone calls. 
[02:26:30]  Woo, I like that.  I like that song.  Boy, the phones, they know, too.  The phones, devoid of people.  It is a virtual vacuum on the phone lines because I don't like the listeners contributing to this program.  Does that always happen when you're hosting or when it's just you, they don't even bother?  When it's just me, they learn.  At the beginning of the show, they try to call up with their little anecdotes and cute little stories about what we're talking about. 
[02:27:00]  But first of all, it's very rare.  Where I would say less than 1% of the time, anybody's call is either interesting or entertaining or pertinent to the conversation.  Right.  They're usually confused, muddled shit that comes out of that phone line.  And then you're stuck trying to resolve it.  You know, just fucking.  Like when I do the compound show, the second someone starts stammering, boom, I hang right the fuck up on them. 
[02:27:30]  Well, they know, boom, out, bye.  How long did it take you to get the audience to just not bother anymore?  Probably two shows.  And they knew by the end of the first one, really, that it was pretty much just don't even fucking call.  An example.  An example.  Pick up line one.  Just pick up line one.  Random fucking call.  It's Pat in Connecticut.  Hi, Pat. 
[02:28:00]  How are you?  What's going on, Ed?  What do you got for the show today?  I just picked up a brand new Wilson close quarter combat elite, and that's what I want to talk about today.  Oh, that's very nice.  A 40?  No, 45.  45, of course.  Well, what do you want to say about it?  Just hands down the nicest 1911 I've ever shot.  I have to agree.  Hey, thanks.  Thanks.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:28:30]  Let's go to line three.  Okay.  Put him on.  Hi.  Who's this?  You're on the air.  This is Dave Harvey from Pennsylvania.  Dave from Pennsylvania.  What do you got for the show?  Dave Harder?  Dave Harder?  Harder?  No, it's Harvey.  Not Harvey.  Harvey.  Harvey.  I thought it was a guy I went to high school with.  Oh.  What do you think of the Walther 380?  I think it's called the P99.  What do you think of that?  I like the PPKS for the Walther. 
[02:29:00]  I'm kind of a classic Walther guy.  It's a great small carry for formal attire.  Maybe you're going to wear something a little less baggy, a little tighter.  You need something small to carry concealed.  The PPKS is great.  All right.  I was going to say, I'm going for either like a little leg holster, but I'm not sure if the gun's too big.  What are you, a girl?  What are you, a girl?  A shoulder holster's all man. 
[02:29:30]  Hell yeah, man.  That's true.  Underneath a suit jacket like fucking Mannix.  Let me do the third call.  Oh, okay.  Well, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  I hope that helped.  Let's go to Don in the great state of Texas.  Hey, Don.  Welcome to Guns and Ammo.  Hey, thanks, Ant.  Hey, I just got, well, my third S&W M&P 15 5.56 NATO, and I was wondering, I'm looking to get a scope for it.  I was wondering if you could suggest.  I'm thinking about an ACOG, but I don't, I mean, there's so many different ones. 
[02:30:00]  Well, yeah, yeah, an ACOG.  What are you going to be shooting, close to a range or a mid or long range?  Well, it depends on how far they get in my yard, but I'm thinking about 100 yards.  100 yards.  I would go with an ACOG.  If you're doing, like, room-to-room kind of shit, I would go with an EOTech, one of the holographics.  But ACOG's are great for mid and even some long range shots.  Do you have any kind of model that I should pick? 
[02:30:30]  Because I know there's some that's got the over...  Percy Brinkley.  It depends on what round you, what kind of round are you shooting?  5.56.  5.56.  Yeah, so get one with a bullet drop compensator that's set for a 5.56 round and you'll be set.  Do you have guns?  Every gun sounds like a Star Wars character.  It's amazing.  MX-388.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Paul in Colorado.  Let's go to Paul in the great square state of Colorado. 
[02:31:00]  The phones are blowing up now.  Hey, Paul!  You know what, dude?  Going through life with blinders on is tough to say, dude.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  That was part of the Alice theme.  Thank you, sir.  And I guess, is that Dune?  It's Dune.  If it's Dwayne, the screener needs to be shot.  No, it's actually Dune.  D-U-N-E.  Like a sand dune.  All right.  Well, I'm wondering about the mentality of owning a gun. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Because I don't own a gun.  I'm not a really big gun enthusiast.  It doesn't scare me.  But have you actually ever come into an instance where you've actually needed a gun?  Not yet.  Yeah, it was a basketball game.  But as they say, I'd rather have a gun and not need it than need a gun and not have one.  See, sir?  And now, what scares you about guns?  I don't know.  I mean, it's...  You know, people like you owning one?  No, it's not people like me.  I'm legal and legit and safe. 
[02:32:00]  What scares you?  I'm not scared of the gun itself.  But you said it.  Kathy, you said it.  You're denying what you just said.  I'm not anti-gun.  Uh-huh.  For me, guns just like...  I don't know.  They kind of make me a little uneasy.  But I'm not anti, you know, the Second Amendment.  Why would something that could blow off one of your appendages make you uneasy?  I don't understand.  Not if you're holding it in the right direction.  That's it.  Have you ever fired a gun, sir? 
[02:32:30]  I have, actually.  And did you enjoy it?  Yeah, it wasn't bad.  I mean, they say now scientifically that firing a gun is very similar to, like, small chemicals  in your brain releasing, similar to when you have an orgasm or something.  Like, I come in my pants every time I fire my guns.  It's quite a sexual experience.  The only gun I fire is my cock.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  My gun.  Get it?  With my jizz bullets.  Yes, because it's got a load in it that I shoot. 
[02:33:00]  All right.  Very good about the guns.  Line seven, I guess, Mark from Pennsylvania.  Mark, how are you?  Hey, Ant.  What's up, my man?  Oh, good.  Very soft-spoken, Mark.  Hi.  Hi.  Welcome to the Anthony Show.  Hey, you're absolutely welcome.  I wanted to get your opinion about Breitbart dropping dead the other day.  Ah, yes.  Andrew Breitbart, of course, everybody, aside from the people that texted me up to two hours 
[02:33:30]  ago with the new news that he had died.  People, believe me, fucking 24 hours after the guy's death, I pretty much know he's dead.  You're not giving me the new news.  I didn't know he died until you said it.  Yeah, I know.  You didn't know.  But here's my opinion.  I don't have an opinion on it.  My opinion is it sucks.  The guy was a fun, fun guy to hang around with.  He was a wild man, a maniac.  But I think the right needed somebody like him.  He never worried about political correctness. 
[02:34:00]  He just spoke his piece.  Did he make mistakes sometimes?  Fuck yeah.  But that's just because he was one of the guys that didn't have to check, recheck, and  then re-recheck what he was saying.  He just fucking went off and spoke his mind about what he was passionate about.  And he was usually right as far as I saw it.  I liked the guy a lot.  Hung out with him.  Good drinking buddy.  And I think the liberals and the left that are actually rejoicing over his death are some 
[02:34:30]  of the biggest hypocrites and fuckbags I've ever read on Twitter.  If it was reversed and some liberal icon or some liberal powerhouse drops dead and conservatives  would come out and bash the shit out of him, there'd be all kinds of news stories about it.  But they're not saying anything about this.  I just think they're assholes and fucking hypocrites.  And Breitbart, he'll be missed. 
[02:35:00]  He was fun and great to read his tweets.  He used to just retweet everyone that bashed him so he wasn't afraid to show how hated  he was by some of these fucking people.  Yeah, I'll miss the guy.  Did he live?  What?  Did he live hard?  Oh, my God.  Did he live?  Yes.  I just hang right up.  I don't let him fucking hang on the line so they can interrupt.  Did he live hard?  Is that why he died at such a young age?  Was he a big, like, hard drinker and stuff? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, when I saw him out, I saw some signs of some pretty good partying going on and the  capability to party pretty hard.  In the past couple of months, also, his hair was disheveled.  He was completely unshaven.  And he had a few instances where he was going off on people like a lunatic in public.  So I don't know if that had anything to do with anything.  His last night, just less than an hour before he died, he was in some bar, drinking some 
[02:36:00]  wine, just talking to some stranger about politics and shit.  So it sounded like a pretty peaceful evening.  And then he went to walk for a little while after midnight out in California and just collapsed.  And that was it.  That was it.  Bye-bye, 43.  Jesus H. Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  That's scary.  But he'll be missed.  I kind of liked his raucous style in politics and stuff because you barely get that.  You know, you get people that pay so much attention on trying to word things in a way 
[02:36:30]  they want to get the point across, but they don't want to hurt this group or that group  or direct attention toward themselves because they might get in trouble.  He didn't give a shit, which was kind of refreshing.  Who was his employer?  He was.  He was self-employed?  Yeah, it was Breitbart.  But I mean, what did he do?  A journalist?  Yeah, yeah, he had a web journalist, blogger, fucking political pundit.  Yeah.  I see.  And, you know, good guy.  He was definitely a fun guy to fucking go out with. 
[02:37:00]  I'll tell you that.  There's a dearth of guys like that out there now.  It's like, I was sad when Hitchens died.  I was sad when Hunter S. Thompson killed himself.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like, it was reassuring to know that there were guys like that out there in the  world that were like old school, that David Jones.  Yeah, the loose cannon.  Yeah, that just kind of, you know, they lived, you know, but not even loose cannon, you know  what I mean?  Like, because loose cannon implies crazy. 
[02:37:30]  It was pretty fucking crazy.  You know, creative thinkers.  People that.  But like, but just people that were, that like you just said, like would walk the edge.  Yeah, yeah.  Walk the line, you know, the edge or whatever, and then go and then just say, hey man, that  experience was what that experience was.  It wasn't about defining it as, you know, craziness or rage or addiction or whatever  label people would put on, you know, behaviors that take you beyond whatever point of expression 
[02:38:00]  that most, the average person's afraid to go beyond.  Yeah.  You just kind of go where you go and say, this is what it is because I'm here to, for the  experience, you know, the, the take the ticket, buy the ticket, take the ride, that whole thing.  Right, right.  Yep, yep, yep.  But it's a shame.  It's the same thing with Carlin.  Like those guys that just said like, I'm going to be a spectator.  I'm not going to be a part of this.  Yeah.  I'm just going to watch and comment, commentate on the whole thing.  And we're losing them.  We're losing.  I don't know if there are any. 
[02:38:30]  This is a big one for the, this is a big one for the right.  There's, there's new ones that come along.  There's.  Yeah, but that's what makes him big though.  But, but let me tell you something.  That's what makes him big.  Like Breck Bart was a guy that like, he, he was hardcore right, hardcore conservative.  And he would shake up the left so fucking bad that they ended up despising him.  He would expose the hypocrisy, expose the political correctness, gone fucking nuts.  And like, there are people that are too afraid to do that.  Well, no, Coulter does it. 
[02:39:00]  There's people, there's always a new one that's going to come up.  There's always one.  Coulter does it to a point though.  Like, like she's vicious when it comes to certain things, but he, he like got out there  and in your face and fucking, you know.  Well, yeah, sorry.  No, no, I was pretty much done with that.  Okay, I know I stepped in too soon and I apologize.  Don't worry, Joe.  It's your show.  No.  No, but she, you know what?  It's a good point you bring up with the Coulter thing because I'm a fan of Ann's and I,  and I've, I've hung out. 
[02:39:30]  I mean, I've done red eye and stuff with her and she's really cool.  And I've had, I've like gotten to eat and lunch with like Michael Moore and shit like  that.  I've gotten to like spend a little bit of time with the extreme views on either side of that  coin.  Yeah.  And I found them both to be very nice people, very endearing and very entertaining in what  they do, but they do only do it to a point.  Like Hitchens would go on a talk show and give the audience the finger.  Fuck you.  Right.  If you don't fucking agree with like, that's, that's what I mean. 
[02:40:00]  It's like Hunter Thompson.  It's like, we're talking about this guy stirring up the, um, um, uh, what's his, I'm sorry.  The guy, Breitbart stirring up the left.  You'll get a guy like Thompson who was definitely way more left than he was right.  Yeah.  Did not like the right at all.  And is clearly embraced by the left side of Hollywood without question.  But here's a guy that had balls that said crazy shit that fucking did what he wanted to  do.  That was a gun nut.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Drug enthusiast, fucking booze hound. 
[02:40:30]  It's like, you could, who, who like that is on the left anymore?  You know what I mean?  That guy was old school left.  Old school left.  Right, right, right.  And we're fucking and doing some LSD.  You know what I mean?  Like nobody like that exists anymore.  You know?  It is true.  So when, when a few pop up that even resemble that, uh, it's, it's terrible when they,  uh, when they drop dead.  Cause, uh, it was making things exciting.  The Chicago seven, Abby Hoffman and people like that back in the day where they were just anti  establishment left. 
[02:41:00]  You know what I mean?  It's different than the left now, which is just a bunch of whiny fucking cunts.  You know, they didn't give a fuck about political correctness.  They were totally against the establishment.  They weren't standing, giving standing ovations to people that don't deserve it just based on  race.  Once you become the overdog, it is impossible for the integrity to remain.  It just can't happen.  That's true.  You have to be an underdog because an underdog situation means that money is not the driving 
[02:41:30]  force.  Once you become the overdog, the, everything is ignited by money at that point.  It becomes business.  Man!  You know what I mean?  But the underdog is trying to get to that point too.  But that's my, but that's my point.  We're talking cartoons and something.  What about like bugs funny?  That's a good impression of Jim's character.  Jim's horrible character chip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what I mean?  It's like, it's like, but that's what you, you don't realize that when you're trying 
[02:42:00]  to get there, right?  Like for instance, just put it into the terms of art.  We're comics, right?  We all fucking sit here and go, why can't I have a show on NBC?  I want the show this.  I want the TV show does that.  I want the movie that does that.  If I was Adam Sandler, I would make these kinds of movies.  We all fucking say that.  We all say it.  Yet nobody's, we never realized like there's a reason why a guy in Adam Sandler's position 
[02:42:30]  doesn't make the kind of movies we want him to make because you get to that point and  then there's people going, listen, motherfucker, here's the deal.  You're a $20 million movie guy.  You want to keep that going or not?  If you do, you're going to make Mr. Deeds.  You're going to make fucking Jack and Jill.  Yeah.  And if you don't, then have a, have a good one, man.  That's not true.  Kevin Smith does what he wants to do.  He does indie movies.  People do indie movies.  But he's not a $20 million.  Yeah, Kevin, it doesn't matter. 
[02:43:00]  No, we're neither.  That doesn't matter because if he is, if he is, uh, what do you call, satisfied or if  he is, you know what I mean, uh, happy with what he's doing and making what he needs to  make, that's all you need.  But that's the trade-off.  Like, Adam Sandler might be happy with the fucking cash and not the artistic integrity.  Kevin Smith is still an underdog, technically.  Yeah, he's still an indie kind of guy.  No, no, in Hollywood, not in life.  In life-y.  No, no, no.  And look, yeah, look, I'm saying, though, you can do, you can do very well for yourself 
[02:43:30]  and live a very happy life.  Yeah, but, but you, you, unless you remain in some way the underdog, you're not, you  can't, you can't be the big winner.  Yeah, once you're the big winner, then everyone wants you.  You just can't.  I don't know.  It's why, it's why your favorite wrestler stinks when he gets the belt and you're like,  I hate this guy now.  I don't always agree with you because Spielberg puts out what he wants to put out.  He puts out some, some great stuff.  He also puts out, you know, and he, you can't be more of an overdog. 
[02:44:00]  Do you think, do you think Spielberg doesn't have to sit there and worry about box office  figures?  Well, he absolutely, he absolutely does.  He's spending 200 million or, or a hundred million on the fucking movie, you know.  Hey, look, look, I'm a Spielberg fan.  I'm a, I'm a big Spielberg fan.  That's real professional.  The guy just takes a phone call in the middle of it.  You're in the middle of a conversation with Rich and he just takes a phone call.  Hello?  Fuck the conversation.  You're in the middle of a major radio show.  The test is positive.  This is the guy that yelled when I tried to order a goddamn sandwich in the corner. 
[02:44:30]  Listen, here's the thing.  I love Spielberg.  I'm a fan of Spielberg, but there's a reason why the end of artificial intelligence sucks.  There's a reason why the end of minority report sucks.  There's a reason why the kid lives at the end of war of the worlds.  If Spielberg could do what the fuck he wanted, he'd be like, Tom Cruise is standing in the  middle of a pile of ashes.  He's all that's left.  He is a man without anything, but he can't. 
[02:45:00]  So then his son's got to run over the hill after you think he died.  You go, God damn it.  He can't, you know, he can't because he chooses.  He can't because Spielberg chooses what he wants.  He, but if he didn't do that, he wouldn't be Spielberg anymore.  He just wouldn't be, he'd be, he'd be, he'd be Kubrick where they would go evil Spielberg  where he would go, God damn, that guy had some big ones in the seventies.  You know what I mean?  I still love his movies.  No, he'd be Woody Allen where you go, Woody Allen, dude, do you know that Woody Allen can't,  his last picture was his highest grossing film of his career. 
[02:45:30]  But two films before that, I think it was, he did a movie called Cassandra's Dream.  He could not get distribution for it.  Fucking Woody Allen couldn't get distribution for his movie.  And it's because he's out there going, I do what the fuck I want, man.  He said, they said in his documentary, his deal with the studio has always been, you hand  me a bag with $2 million in it and I'll bring you a movie.  No questions asked.  That's it.  And it's like, when you operate like that, you do what you want, but that guy still lives 
[02:46:00]  in an apartment on the Upper West Side.  He's content.  I'm not saying he's not content, but that's what we're talking about.  How do you know, Rich?  Huh?  How do you know?  That's a good point.  Because he keeps doing what he's doing.  So obviously he is content.  He didn't sell out.  But, but that's fine.  The argument isn't, are you content or not content?  What the argument is, is in the 60s, the left was a tremendous underdog as a, as a political  party.  Uh, and everything was the right.  Everything was Nixon and Truman and right. 
[02:46:30]  Truman.  Are you talking about fucking, uh, Kennedy?  No, wait, no.  Truman was back in the fucking, uh, it was different back then.  Yeah, it was different back then.  But Truman was right though, correct?  Kennedy was early 60.  Truman dropped the fucking bomb.  So Truman, Nixon, I apologize.  I know I'm not very astute, uh, politically, but you know, Truman, Nixon, it was, it was,  it was the, it was, it was the evil right, our parents' generation, all this stuff.  And the left was the Kennedys and the good looking young thing of the, the speaking your 
[02:47:00]  mind and equality and all that stuff.  And it was so, and you know, you're in a fucking culture where black people aren't allowed to  drink out of the goddamn water fountain with you.  And, and, uh, I, and in other words, it's like when you're at Anthony's house.  Yes, it's back by my pool.  But do you know what I mean?  It wasn't, it wasn't like it is now.  It wasn't, it wasn't post, uh, uh, it wasn't post, like, like, like, uh, uh, Jimmy Carter 
[02:47:30]  was like seen as this like knight in shining armor.  Oh boy.  It comes down to this show.  You know, exactly.  So now we're post Carter, post Clinton, post whatever.  It's, it's different now.  They've, they've had their day in the sun and it can't be what it was.  It comes down to corporation.  It comes down to everything.  It's all fucking numbers.  I know.  That's what I'm saying though.  From, from clubs to radio to everything is numbers.  You can't just write everything off as, uh, well, everything's bullshit now and it's  all horseshit and everything's the same. 
[02:48:00]  No matter who gets all, you can't just say that anymore.  Yeah.  No, you can't.  No, you can't.  You can't.  But what?  You don't think so?  Because that offers you nothing.  Yeah.  That makes it like, like, you don't, you don't, you don't maybe hope a little bit of fucking  something will, will ooze in that'll, that'll switch things up.  That enough people will get disgusted with something, that it actually does change.  In my opinion, in my opinion, believing in government is like believing in God.  It makes you feel good. 
[02:48:30]  It makes you sleep a little bit better at night and it makes you think that you might  have a fighting chance at some sort of utopian existence, but you don't.  It's not out there.  It's bullshit.  And, and it's been proven particularly in the last 15 years, 10 years, whatever, with  what has happened in the presidency, people said, we don't want Bush.  We hate him.  He stole, and then he stole the election, got it anyway.  At the end of his first term, the most hated or unpopular president in the history of this 
[02:49:00]  country went right in again for another four years.  Then Obama steps in.  Everybody goes, it's all going to change.  He's going to end this.  He's going to change that.  This is going to be different.  He gets into office.  Nothing changes.  Things continually get worse.  He sends more troops in to this war that he, that he campaigned on stopping as soon  as he got into office.  Yeah.  It's all bullshit.  At the end of the day, money conquers everything.  There is no hope.  It will never get better.  The machine has been running this way for a long time. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  And people think a couple sit-ins and protests are going to make a fucking difference.  And it's not.  But I'm talking about like real change as far as the people's attitude.  But people are so fucking apathetic.  They don't, people aren't passionate about anything.  As long as they do have their little corner of the world notched out and they go, they  do have a job.  They can, you know, maybe buy a little car. 
[02:50:00]  And then no one wants to achieve anything more.  No one really tries.  We don't try as a country to make, make things better.  It's been beat out of us.  It has been.  You're right.  People are living in fear.  That's what they're on.  They're on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, month.  Now fear of what?  Fear of, fear of losing their job, fear of losing their house, fear of saying something  where they could lose their job, then lose their house.  All right.  Fear of, fear of every fucking thing that has been brainwashed into their head. 
[02:50:30]  They're, they're running scared.  And that's basically what's happening.  Uh, uh, anywhere from, from, uh, uh, entertainment to, oh, don't say this.  Don't do that.  To, to hear the radio.  Don't do this.  Don't do that.  It's all about money, numbers, and fear.  So what's the end game?  Where does it go?  Here's where it goes.  Because like he says, when you're doing your own thing, when you're doing, when you do  podcasts, okay, no one could tell you what to do.  No one.  There's no FCC. 
[02:51:00]  There's none of that crap.  It's a podcast when you're, when you're on stage as a comic, that's one of the last  places you're allowed to, to, to, to use the freedom of speech.  Although one comic was tweeting about another one, which was all bullshit.  So people are running scared that are working in fucking companies that are going, holy  fuck, are we going to close tomorrow?  People, you know, and then they're trying to fucking, you know, it's left.  It's right.  Go on the left.  Go on the right.  That's all bullshit.  It's all big money.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But we, but we know where we are. 
[02:51:30]  Where is it?  Where does it go?  This is what, this is what, how does it end?  Individually.  This is no, no, no.  This is what, I don't think so.  But I, okay, I, I, I have a bit about similar to what you're talking about, about like we  live in this, we live in this culture where every action is determined on one thing, that  there will be no reaction.  You're scared.  You're on videotape constantly.  You're under surveillance.  You're scared.  You're going to get sued.  You're, we're in a crumbling economy.  So you're scared you're going to lose your job. 
[02:52:00]  You know, you're, you know, whatever.  It goes on and on.  There's fear.  It's just fear surrounding everybody all the time.  So nobody wants to react to anything.  So they poke you in the fucking forehead.  They poke you in the chest.  They keep you down.  And I don't mean just the authorities.  I mean, you and me, I'm in the street.  I bump into you.  You don't say, excuse me.  And we go, fuck it.  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it to argue with this guy because what if this happens?  What if I get shot?  What if I get stabbed?  Right.  My boss just called me a cunt in front of the entire audience. 
[02:52:30]  I don't, I can't, or in front of the entire office.  I don't want to get fired.  You know what I mean?  It's all these things, right?  So the end game is nothing.  This is where it's been headed.  This is where we are, and it can't turn into anything else.  This is where it's been headed for years and years and years.  They finally succeeded in turning this country into Disney World.  You know, it's 50 states of Disney World.  It's a fucking scene part.  There's got to be a backlash of some sort.  Well, there can't, and here's what, here's the thing. 
[02:53:00]  They got us where they want us, and it's not going to change, and here's why.  You can get angry about it as much as you want, and that's what Occupy Wall Street was.  It was people saying we're, I know, but to just look at it as an example.  It was people saying we're angry.  We're tired of this shit.  Okay?  We want to make our voices heard.  Okay, great.  Well, guess what?  They showed, with that whole movement, in a very delicate way, we will turn this place  into a fucking police state if we have to. 
[02:53:30]  You know, people see these revolts in Egypt and Libya and wherever else, and they go,  look, a difference can be made.  Yeah, in those countries, you think after the shit that took place here in the 60s,  they're going to let that happen again?  They're going to let people march and make a difference?  They're never going to fucking let that happen again.  It's absolutely true.  Look, you can march.  You can do a useless march.  You can march.  It's not going to change anything.  You can do a useless march.  It's not going to change anything.  Unless you're willing to fight the cops, that's it.  Here's the end game. 
[02:54:00]  You want to know, Dian?  When your four-year-old writes you, Happy Valentine's Day, I love you, Daddy.  That's the end game, because you know what?  The end game is within yourself.  Are you serious?  No, yes.  Here's the end game.  It's within yourself.  What is this?  The Wizard of Oz?  No, listen to me, you fucking homos.  Tap my heels.  You're calling us homos with that?  Okay.  The four-year-old writing a Valentine's Day card?  You're right, because everything else...  Yeah, it all ends with a sled named fucking Rosebud.  Yeah, it's all...  Listen to me.  Everything else is bullshit, because you can't fuck... 
[02:54:30]  No, everything else, you can't win.  Rich, Rich, which farmers are playing me and Anthony in your fantasy?  I'm telling you.  Come on, Rich.  It's not a fantasy.  The fantasy is what's going to make you happy.  Happy is within what's going to make you fucking happy.  You know what?  Yeah.  You know what?  The government...  The government...  And I'll use this as an example for me.  Can't take my sobriety away.  They can't stop me from not doing drugs.  They can't stop me from not being on stage.  They can stop...  The improv...  It sounds like great stuff.  Well, no, but what are you saying? 
[02:55:00]  But what are you saying?  I'm saying...  How about true freedoms?  How about true freedoms making me happy?  You don't want true freedoms because you have everything fucking monitored around your house.  You have everything monitored wherever you go.  So what the fuck?  Well, if you're not monitoring...  If you want to monitor everything, why can't everything else be monitored around you?  How about true freedoms?  How about I just yesterday got my reapplication for my New York City pistol permit in the mail?  Yes.  20 fucking pages of shit that's got to be filled out.  $500 that's got to be given to them. 
[02:55:30]  And then they still got to review shit.  And it's like, this is supposed to be my Second Amendment right.  It's just...  There's not enough true freedoms left.  Well, they're literally diming everybody.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.  They're finding any way possible they can to make fucking money.  How about the fact that maybe I want to take down a tree in my yard or plant a tree or something.  I need a permit.  I want to put a fence up in my yard.  I need a permit.  I need somebody to come in and give me a variance.  I need permission.  Is that really true freedom?  If I buy my house and pay it off but don't pay my taxes on the property, I lose my house that is supposed to be my house? 
[02:56:00]  It's not really my house then.  It's not...  Yeah, exactly.  You don't own anything.  You have no freedom to do anything, really.  Go outside with a little .22 rifle and try to hunt a rabbit for dinner around your neighborhood.  Watch how quick you get fucking guns drawn on you.  There's no freedom...  That's what I'm saying.  There's no true freedom to do anything.  Listen, Davy Crockett.  You're not really...  That was an example, shithead.  That was a bad example.  That sounded really crazy. 
[02:56:30]  But it's not crazy.  I'm not talking about down on Queens Boulevard.  I'm saying if you even live out east in Suffolk County and go in the woods and safely...  I think I said down the street.  Now you're in the woods.  I pictured your neighborhood when you said that and it looked crazy.  I didn't mean going across the neighbor's lawns and plunking away at bunny rabbits and cats.  Say you're on the subway and you're hungry and you pull out your fucking Uzi. 
[02:57:00]  Okay?  You never know when a rabbit's going to run by.  You fucking psycho bad.  Look, jerky.  What I'm saying is we don't really have freedom.  They say we live in the greatest nation.  We're free to do...  We're not free to do anything.  Yeah, we are.  Not really.  You're free to pursue your dreams.  You need to follow the fucking rules.  That's what you're free to do.  Yeah, right.  And there should be rules.  But you're...  You don't think there should be rules?  Not to the extent that we have on it.  Where do you draw the line?  Where do you draw the line?  Well, a few fucking rules back. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I think.  To make that makes your life easier.  But here's the thing.  No, it makes everybody's life freer.  Not easier.  It might even be more dangerous out there.  But the freedoms that are taken away under the guise of keeping us safe are taking away freedoms.  That's exactly right.  But you're saying exactly what I'm saying.  Oh, am I?  Yeah.  What I'm saying to you is...  Kathy's a cunt?  That Voss's story was gay.  Right.  That's true. 
[02:58:00]  The four-year-old writing a card.  I just wanted to bring that back.  It's all in yourself.  It is.  I hope you meant AIDS.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I'm sitting in for Jimmy Norton.  I know.  I'm teasing, of course.  I love Jimmy.  Hold on a second.  I got to burp.  We're saying the same thing.  We're saying it with gas.  We're saying the same thing.  Yes.  And that is IKFC last night.  We don't have these freedoms. 
[02:58:30]  We absolutely...  Oh, you're shot at me.  Shut up for a second.  Let me finish.  We don't have these freedoms.  You're absolutely right.  And all I'm saying is, in addition to that, nothing is going to change that.  Nothing.  Yes.  It will never change.  It's not going to...  And maybe if you campaign for your entire fucking life, your stupid city council or township  board will go, all right, we'll cut the fucking tree down.  Whatever.  You know what I mean?  Who wants to deal with that?  Forget it.  And again, back to callback to that Carlin thing, it's allowances. 
[02:59:00]  That's all it is.  It's little allowances to give you the idea that you can make a difference, to make yourself  feel better, right?  But, if it came to a real change, if it came to a real allowance, if it came to really  fucking the 1%, it would be a goddamn police state.  It would be.  There's a reason there's a 1%, and there's a reason they get away with murder.  Because they support the fucking rest of the country.  They support the rest of the world. 
[02:59:30]  Yes.  Exactly.  So, it's...  They're not going anywhere.  It's not going to change.  Of course not.  And to speak to your point, you can't have these little queefy things in your fucking  life that make you happy.  Of course, we all have...  I know, but we all have them.  Whatever it is, we all have our little things that make us want to get out of bed in the  morning.  Happy moments, right.  But the point is, is it's either you're off the fucking radar, and you can be off the  radar even as a millionaire, but you're either off the radar, you keep your head down and 
[03:00:00]  your mouth shut, essentially, or you try to jump into the fight, which is fucking  pointless.  It's pointless.  So, all you can do is just step back and go, you know what?  I'm going to just watch this whole thing.  I'll have intellectual discussions with people, but I'm not getting my hands dirty.  It's pointless.  It's pointless.  You see Anthony's point.  Of course, there's too much security.  It's all bullshit.  But, you know, insurance prices are fucking $20,000 a year for me in Jersey. 
[03:00:30]  My property tax, my fucking car insurance.  It's insane.  It's insane, okay?  And that's just things you have to fight for to lower your fucking taxes, your health  insurance.  But it's not going to be lowered to the point it should.  Here's what it should be.  Here's what it should be.  When you decide you're done fucking working and that you've stocked up enough money to  keep you in food and clothing and whatnot, you shouldn't be held hostage to the government  to still pay all these taxes or you'll lose your house, lose your property, lose your insurance. 
[03:01:00]  There's too much shit that even when you're done with life and just want to lay back and  fucking soak in the raise, you're still fucking hostage to the government.  You have to pay them fucking mob money so they don't take your shit.  And you will be.  That will never stop.  I know, but that's what I'm saying.  That shit's got to stop.  But here's how they'll get you to get it to stop, right? 
[03:01:30]  Because here's what it is.  This is a machine, as we've already said, right?  It's a fucking machine.  A machine works with parts that are willing to connect and work together harmoniously  within the machine.  That's how the machine works.  I think you're speaking figuratively.  If the machine has a bad part, if there's a cog or whatever, you know, or a chink in the  arm or whatever you want to call it, it needs racism.  It's part of the racism.  Oh, listen, listen.  All right, you're right.  I'm sorry.  There's no room for that here. 
[03:02:00]  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I'd like to apologize.  If you're saying it's missing a spade.  I'd like to apologize to the chinks for what I just said.  To the people that wear armor.  People that wear armor.  No, I'm kidding.  Listen, I love aging people.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Anyway, here's the thing.  If you're going to be a bad part in the machine,  the machine will spit you out.  And the way it does that is it says to a guy like you, OK, you don't want to worry about 
[03:02:30]  high property tax.  You don't want to worry about this.  You don't want to.  Move to this fucking piece of land in the woods in Montana that nobody gives a shit about.  Write a manifesto.  But you're not going to be here.  No.  You're not going to be anywhere you want to be.  Go to Canada.  Go to Europe.  Whatever.  Go to a fucking island.  That's a paradise.  But you live by yourself.  America is supposed to be the place that's free.  Like, that's supposed to be the place.  But it's bullshit.  I know.  You've got to pay.  I just wish other people would know that.  Jersey has the highest in fucking taxes and everything. 
[03:03:00]  But you do have to pay something.  I mean, someone is fucking fixing the roads and building highways and doing this and that.  So you do have to pay some type of money into it.  So you have the convenience to get to your house.  50% of the nation don't.  I said some.  I didn't say that much.  Okay?  Insurance, you know, they have to pay fucking doctors and hospitals.  So where's the even medium?  Where's the balance?  And that's why there's no balance.  Here's what it is.  There's no way out. 
[03:03:30]  There's no fucking way out of it.  Unless you're Kevin Costner.  Until you die.  Until you die.  There's no way out of the debt and the paying.  And once you get in the game, you can't get out of it and have a lifestyle.  That you're accustomed to.  There is a way out.  You just don't want it.  What is it?  Live in a shack?  I'm saying.  That's the point.  But I'm saying.  Right now you're staying in the Four Seasons.  You're in the Four Seasons right now.  Yes.  You know?  Or the W or wherever.  Right?  And you're sitting here going, I gotta fucking pay all this fucking money for the room. 
[03:04:00]  And I gotta pay 25 bucks a day for internet.  Are you shitting me?  I should have free internet.  And they're going, you want free internet?  Go to the fucking Red Roof Inn.  It's right over there.  And you're like, I don't want to go to the Red Roof Inn.  And they're going, well then pay for the fucking internet.  I don't like your analogy because I'm done.  I'm done.  I now own the place.  But you get what I'm saying. 
[03:04:30]  I get what you're saying.  Come on, you get what I'm saying.  I understand it.  I just don't like the fact that there's no way out of the game.  There's a way out of the game.  It's you sell your house and you move to a place where it's not the game anymore.  To keep your shit.  You've paid all your shit.  You've paid it off.  You haven't.  You think you have, but you haven't.  That's exactly it.  And that's the point.  Exactly.  We agree.  I'm just saying I wish there was some fucking revolutionary way to get rid of this system 
[03:05:00]  where you can't stop running on the fucking treadmill.  You see what happens to revolutionaries in this country?  The government throws Molotov cocktails into their fort.  That's what happens.  I think they said there's babies in there.  Well, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, fuck it.  Fuck it.  Yeah, this guy wants to live in this house and not fucking pay his shit and not register  his weapons and not do this.  All right.  Throw in the fucking fire. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Throw in some fire.  How about a little fire, scarecrow?  That's pretty much what they did.  They used the wicked witch tactic on the scarecrow for when these revolutionaries perk up.  Yeah, that's it.  They'll just smoke you up.  Throw a little fire.  I've always grown up.  I've grown up with a lot of faith in the government and a lot of respect for it.  And I'm not a revolutionary in that sense of the word.  But I look at this and think that maybe there's a way to switch it up without a bloody fucking 
[03:06:00]  militia-based revolution against the government.  There's no...  But then you realize, no, you're just stuck.  And then even after you're dead, they will tax what's left that goes to your fucking family  because you're dead.  Did you ever watch...  Sorry.  It makes no sense to me that you're stuck in it.  You're stuck on the hamster wheel until even after you're dead.  Did you ever watch...  No! 
[03:06:30]  Did you ever watch Hoffa or read about the Teamsters and all that shit?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like they fucking had to fight the cops.  Yes.  They had to fist fight the cops.  People think like the Teamsters, like, that was a nice thing that they did for the truckers.  It's like people literally died so truckers could get a better hourly wage.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Paid them a good wage.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  And it's... 
[03:07:00]  To me, this whole thing, like trying to make a change, trying to make a difference, whatever  it is, in this day and age, back in the 30s, 40s, whatever, I think you maybe had a fighting  chance.  Yeah.  Maybe you moved up to the 60s.  But now, in this day and age, to me...  The glue has set.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no changing the pieces around anymore.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And the best analogy for me is the Ticketmaster, the Pearl Jam Ticketmaster analogy.  It's like we fought and we fought and we fought and we fought because Ticketmaster  is evil.  Fuck these fees.  Our tickets will now be 25 cents cheaper after a 10-year fucking bloodbath. 
[03:07:30]  It's like you're going to get this...  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Now, when you hear the politicians talking about change and how they're going to do this  and that and the other thing and change things and make your life better, and then you listen  to what we're talking about.  The change that would like...  Huge change.  You know, huge change in the taxes.  Huge change in how you're treated after you want to leave the game.  You realize what little these motherfuckers even have the ability to do. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  It's horrifying.  Right.  They're more...  Well, I mean, anybody of power...  They're all fucking warrants.  They can't balance the budget.  Well, they can be the smartest guys in the world, but they're powerless to change anything,  even if they really honestly wanted to change something, which I don't think they do.  They just want their jobs and perpetuate that, but there's no changing it.  Like Joe said, the machine is working, it's moving, the parts are whizzing by, and there's 
[03:08:30]  no way to...  Unless you throw a fucking monkey wrench in there, there's no way to change the parts  when it's moving as quickly as it's moving.  Well, because they're all saying no, because no keeps their jobs.  When Governor Christie says, I'm going to raise the tolls 50% on the turnpike, 50%, okay?  All his fucking advisors, any of them say, you can't do that, bye.  I don't need you.  You know, so it's all yes people to these people.  They can't balance any fucking budgets.  The people are paying.  Like I say, no other business could raise their price 50 fucking percent.  These fucking tunnels run from $8 to $12. 
[03:09:00]  No other business on this planet would raise their price 50% and stay in business.  I mean, it's not from $8 to $8.50, from $8 to $12 fucking dollars.  But who are you going to go to complain?  Nobody.  What are you going to go to the other...  Are you going to go to Bob's Tunnel?  I'm taking Bob's Midtown Tunnel today.  They make it impossible.  They make it impossible.  And then they all blame the other person.  Well, the governor said, well, that's it.  Taking the George Washington Carver Bridge today.  That's the one.  It's a lot cheaper.  Yeah, try swimming across the fucking Hudson and see what they do to you. 
[03:09:30]  And you know what?  They'll arrest you.  Exactly.  You're not even allowed to swim.  How about you want to take a rowboat across the Hudson every day and go to work that way  so you don't have to pay any tolls.  You get arrested.  And dude, do you think...  Look, I know this might be a little overly paranoid or whatever, but do you think there  isn't some aspect of this where, like, the Hudson is the most disgusting, polluted fucking  pile of shit water?  So fucking polluted. 
[03:10:00]  You know?  The Schuylkill River is the same way around Philly and stuff.  Do you think there's not somebody sitting there going, leave it dirty so nobody tries  to rowboat across the fucking thing?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a goddamn poisonous moat.  Don't pay the 12 bucks.  Nobody's fucking going to do that thing.  The whole country's in a quick fix mood.  Yeah.  They're in for a quick fix.  The airlines, everything is quick.  What can we do now to make quick money?  What can we take away from them?  It's all a quick fix and it never works.  They're not looking to build future customers. 
[03:10:30]  They're looking right the fuck now, tomorrow, what are we going to do?  Well, when we keep giving them all the money they want to spend frivolously, why would they  want to change anything?  We're great fucking, we're great saps.  We're fucking sheep.  We bitch about it, but I write that fucking check every three months that goes to the government.  Back to, and that goes full circle back to the technology thing.  We're sheep.  They're sitting there going, if we just put a camera in everybody's hands, they'll do 
[03:11:00]  it to themselves.  They'll take pictures of each other fucking up.  They'll do it to themselves.  We can monitor all of it.  We're monitoring the cell phones already.  We are a big brother.  Let them videotape each other on it.  There's no way.  We are our own big brother.  That's how it worked out in the end.  Of course.  We ended up being the bad guys to ourselves by fucking popping our cell phones up at  the drop of a fucking hat whenever anyone's doing anything.  How does all science and technology progress?  Anything in science and technology progresses in one way. 
[03:11:30]  Choose.  Choose.  Well, grants.  Grants.  It's all developed through grants.  Ulysses, that's something.  It's all developed through grants, and grants are provided by either the government or the  lobbyists that fund politicians.  That's it.  It's all fucking connected.  You're getting into something a little more devious.  We talked about this earlier, but you're giving the government a lot more credit.  I think they're capitalizing on what's happening more so than causing what's happening as far 
[03:12:00]  as technology goes.  They see something.  They see a company like Apple, and they invent a phone with a camera.  It gets very popular.  Now people are snapping pictures and video of their neighbors doing things, putting it  up on YouTube, and arrests are directly being made because of that.  I don't think they said, our plan is working perfectly.  They're eating these cameras up.  I think that they conveniently go hand in hand or a little too coincidentally fit together. 
[03:12:30]  I think they appreciate when technology like this comes out because it makes it easier  for them to keep tabs on shit, but I don't think they're the ones behind the manufacturing  and development.  But you can't...  Here's the thing.  You can't tell me this.  It just can't be...  It can't be...  They can't be mutually exclusive.  They just can't be.  A government that has the ability...  You know, we talked about this months and months ago when Bobby and Billy and I were  on here together.  You talk about a government that had technology in the fucking 70s to make phone calls from 
[03:13:00]  an airplane, right?  That was strictly exclusive government technology.  There's no way Apple beat them to the punch with the development of phone technology.  They just didn't.  There's no way Apple was like, hey government, we figured out this minority report technology  where you slide things with your finger on the screen.  There's no fucking way they had it first. 
[03:13:30]  So you think that us as consumers and as the populace wouldn't ever buy a government-made  camera device.  We'd be like, hey, we want all you people to have one of these.  We'd be like, fuck you.  I'm not carrying a government camera device to rat out my neighbors.  But then when a company like Apple comes around and sells it, now we're willing to be cool  and have this device.  And meanwhile, it's got the same end.  I think it's...  Who do you think is coming up with this for the government? 
[03:14:00]  It's the people from Apple.  It's not...  That's who...  That's my point.  That's my point.  This is just so funny.  As you were yelling that and I was thinking about what I said and what Anthony just said,  this is really turning into the end of awakening.  I know, yeah.  They're all against us.  We need to revolt.  Listen, we sound really paranoid.  Oh, we do.  It's great.  But here's the thing.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  It's not the government going... 
[03:14:30]  Well, it is.  It's everything we're saying right now.  It's the government going to a company like Apple and going, listen, we sort of have this  thing that we've got and we want to develop that further.  And we think you guys are great contractors to do that.  So we'll fund you to develop your product if you help us develop ours.  And what do you say we put the cameras into the phones and, you know, that's in our interest  because, you know, whatever.  There's no fucking way it doesn't work like that. 
[03:15:00]  It has to work like that.  See, that is that one more step that I'm not willing to take quite yet.  I don't blame you.  I'm a cynical motherfucker and I do believe there are shenanigans going on in the government.  But I just don't see them being that smart to figure out how to get all of us to carry  cameras, recording devices, little typey writers so we can type out where we are, what we're  doing, what we're up to, what our friends are up to.  If Frank Sinatra and every other celebrity that seems to be at that sort of status, and 
[03:15:30]  I know that that's a pretty big status, but if Frank Sinatra was in bed basically with  every president that ever lived and you see all these celebrities hobnobbing around the  White House and you see the Foo Fighters doing a $32,000 per ticket fundraiser for Obama 
[03:16:00]  and all this stuff, you see all these things.  If just those motherfuckers are getting knocks on the door and phone calls from the government  and the president and whoever else, what do you think Bill Gates is getting?  There is no fucking way a guy like Bill Gates as, you can't, for Christ's sakes, anybody  that's influential in a revolutionary way is dead, is dead, assassinated, shot, boom,  fucking dead.  You know, that's why I always laugh when people go, can you believe Obama, there's never been 
[03:16:30]  an assassination?  It's like, yeah, I can totally believe it.  What do you think?  Some fucking redneck from Mississippi knows how to get anywhere near Obama to try to assassinate  him?  Right.  Assassinations come from more devious places than that.  Do you think a little closer to the source?  I think so.  That's just my opinion.  And I'm not trying to say anything that's too inflammatory.  I'm just saying like...  No, no, you're just saying what it is.  You know, it's like, but you read the conspiracies around Malcolm X and Kennedy and Martin Luther 
[03:17:00]  King.  This comes up a lot.  Who was really behind the assassination?  Right.  Every revolutionary that gets to a certain level, boom, fucking dead.  There's no way that somebody that is worth financially what Bill Gates is worth and that has had the  influence on the culture that he has had, tremendous influence, that the government is  not knocking on his fucking door.  There's just no way.  It's far too dangerous.  You can't let a man like that operate freely and go, hey, I'm worth billions. 
[03:17:30]  Uh, I basically control the computer industry.  You know, I can do whatever I want.  Bullshit.  You're going to fucking do whatever you want.  There's no way.  Well, what do they do when you got too power and he got too much money?  What's it called when they just...  What?  ...dissembled him?  When they...  When Gates had too much money, they fucking...  Uh-oh.  No, I don't know the word.  That's what I'm saying.  Were they...  Of.  Was.  The.  The. 
[03:18:00]  Where he was too big and they fucking basically put a hawk to it.  You remember what I'm talking about.  I'm not trying to make...  I just don't know the word.  I know.  I don't know either.  I don't really...  Antitrust laws?  Ah, whatever.  No?  It just...  He was too powerful and they...  You know, he...  Like when they had a monopoly on something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had like...  You know, he lost like $160 million that day or whatever. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, there was...  There was...  There was something...  There are antitrust suits that come up.  There was something about the monopoly laws that Microsoft had a monopoly on the computer  industry.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  I know what you're talking about.  I can't remember either.  But it's like...  It's like...  Come on, man.  It's like this fucking guy's company has the...  The only operating system.  The only operating system for every computer. 
[03:19:00]  There is no fucking way the government did not have some involvement in this process.  Some say in what was going on, you think?  There's no way.  There's no way.  Now, I guess you could counter-argue and go, well, what about the internet?  The worldwide internet and it's unpoliced.  So, I don't know.  Maybe.  You think it's unpoliced?  A lot of people do get in trouble for what they post and what they do.  A lot of people...  Well, let's put it this way.  It's being policed by...  If not the government, by other people.  Snitches.  Yeah, that's true.  It's unpoliced... 
[03:19:30]  Snitches.  Wow.  It's unpoliced in the sense that you can do illegal shit on it without fucking question.  You can do illegal shit on the internet if you wanted to.  Yeah, but you can get caught.  It's like anything else.  You could do illegal shit in real life and not get caught.  Yeah, all right, well...  It's probably easier, but yeah.  My argument gets even stronger.  Even stronger there, Joe.  Wow.  We do sound like a bunch of paranoid...  What is this, Art Bell?  The fucking Art Bell show?  When did the UFOs come into play in this fucking conversation? 
[03:20:00]  Area 51, I swear it.  You gotta look over your shoulder and see your three imaginary friends?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Well, you know what, we've...  Or audience members.  All the smart phones can help on crime easily as our way.  I thought they were calling in.  All the smart phone stuff can help you get away with a crime as easily as it can get you  caught for a crime.  That's...  Oh, Taylor from Canada.  What does he mean by that?  Let's talk to Taylor. 
[03:20:30]  Hi, Taylor.  Taylor.  Taylor.  So that's...  That's my problem.  Go ahead, bright eyes.  Talk, bright eyes.  I'm talking.  That's my problem with Joe's argument.  You could create a perfect alibi using your check-ins with Facebook and Foursquare and, you know, tweeting.  Oh, you can?  You could use that to get away with a crime as much as you could get caught.  Well, that's absolutely not true.  You could use that as an alibi in the sense that you could give someone your phone and 
[03:21:00]  go, just say I was here, there, and then this...  Or go to McDonald's while I rob the bank and check in.  But, I mean, then it's just a matter of the cops getting to...  Or the authorities getting to the person that you gave your fucking phone to.  Do not feel we'll fucking tear that down in pieces.  And then there's other cameras in places like, well, if you were there and you say we're  there, why are you on camera at this fucking, you know, Starbucks or some shit?  Because everybody goes to...  Everyone goes to Walmart or something.  It's like, well, here's a video of them buying duct tape and fucking clothespins and razorblades. 
[03:21:30]  Can't they make the...  By the way, can't they make the security camera footage better than that fucking claymation  stop motion?  It really is.  Every time you see it, it's like...  It skips like 10 frames between every movement.  It doesn't have to be like that.  What the fuck?  That's because the government hasn't got a hold of it yet.  24 hours a day of video, it's going to be shitty.  Yeah, no shit.  Not these days.  It's called a joke, you Taylor douche.  How about you buy terabyte after terabyte of hard drive space and just fucking dump nice 
[03:22:00]  HD video onto it?  Well, you know, you heard what AT&T is doing if you're an unlimited customer and you're  using too much data.  What do they do?  They fucking...  They throttle your phone.  They slow down your data.  They slow your phone down so you can't eat as much?  Yeah, so you can't eat as much.  Motherfuckers.  Like, I mean, how do you fight that?  How do you fight AT&T when you already got unlimited data?  That's what you...  Here's another one.  Joe's putting a fart in Rich's face.  It doesn't matter.  Rich tries to articulate something.  I'm just going to let you do his CD. 
[03:22:30]  Here's another one.  I joined Bally's.  I joined Bally's as a lifetime member, goal member, years ago.  Iraq's with bellies.  Okay.  So, they went...  Happy birthday, Iraq.  Bellies.  I thought you were going to say Bally's.  Listen, they went and sold...  God damn it.  They went...  You know, and in my deal, I get to go to Bally's around the country.  His favorite machine is the snack machine.  I'm working out.  Yeah, I'm going to hit the machine today.  I'm doing E3. 
[03:23:00]  I'm doing 10 reps on E3.  The Stairmaster, he just stares at it.  He does crunches or Nestle's.  So, happy birthday, Iraq.  Oh, poor boy.  Captain Crunches. 
[03:23:30]  It's Stairmaster.  Yeah, he just stares at it as he eats cookies.  He stares at it.  So, Bally's, my deal was, I'm a lifetime member.  I get to work out at Bally's around the country.  Okay, I pay yearly dues.  Okay, just in case.  And I've only used it maybe once a year for $80.  But Bally's went and sold most of the clubs to LA Fitness.  Now, I can't use LA Fitness.  What the fuck?  I was a lifetime member.  Where's my fucking... 
[03:24:00]  Who do I...  Where's my money back?  Oh, you don't get that back.  I signed on with Bally.  Exactly, you signed, and you signed a contract that allows them to do anything they want.  It's insane.  Non-transferable.  You can't do this.  You can't do that.  Yeah.  Yeah, and look, you could probably theoretically fight that until you got your money back.  But at the end of the day, you're going to go, well, Christ, what am I making?  You got to cost $70,000 to win, get back $500.  Yeah, exactly.  But doesn't it scare you a bit about what I was talking about earlier with where you can't get out? 
[03:24:30]  You need to earn money in some way, shape, or form.  Now, you might get lucky and have a retirement account that does pay for everything for the rest of your older life.  But don't you wonder, like, man, am I going to be able to even afford to have a fucking roof over my head?  Are you kidding me?  I'm worried about that for next year.  Yeah, I know.  It's terrible.  Fuck retirement.  Yeah, this is the conversation Voss and I have every other day, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrifying.  Fucking health insurance is $20,000 a year.  It's crazy. 
[03:25:00]  That means I have to make $30,000 to pay $20,000, basically, when it comes to tax.  Okay, that's just health insurance.  I don't even want to get fucking insurance.  Like, my CD, Still Empty Inside on iTunes, is what's paying for me to fucking.  I'm not pushing every fucking thing.  It's crazy.  We talk about this on Fomia and DeRosa.  Everybody's money is going up.  You know, every company's, every business.  Yet, our money is going down.  And even if you're doing numbers. 
[03:25:30]  I did last week, I did over 1,000 people.  Every comic I talk to, the club owners are just fucking about it.  It's ridiculous.  Last week, I did over 1,000 fucking people and made less money than I would have made five  years ago doing 600 people.  See what I'm saying?  And it's not everybody, but there's a lot of clubs out there.  They're offering less money than they were offering people in the 90s.  Yes, literally.  Unless you're a celebrity.  Or a big sell, whatever.  But, like, it's the base level money. 
[03:26:00]  They're offering, a lot of them are offering less than they were offering in the 90s.  It's like, I'm about to go on this tour through the southeast.  You know, like, I'm going to, like, actually this month.  Atlanta?  I'm going to Georgia.  I'm going to North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee.  So, actually, listeners, come out to the shows, please.  But I'm doing, like, small clubs and small venues.  Rock venues, small clubs.  You know, that pay less, but pay less for good reason. 
[03:26:30]  Because it's a smaller venue and also more are openly artistic venues where you can conceivably be like, well, okay, if I'm not going to make a ton of money, I'll go do those venues and grassroots it.  Right, right.  And try to have control, a little more control over what I'm doing.  Yeah.  Versus trying to get into the machine and make less money.  And then at the end of the day going, well, what the fuck?  I saw 68 plates of salmon go out while I was on stage.  Why am I getting no money right now?  You know what I mean?  And not only that, they appreciate it. 
[03:27:00]  Like, when you work certain places, it's like, I worked a place, like, four years ago.  And I pretty much almost sold out, except for, and I go.  Except for all the shows.  No, except.  No, and I go to the manager.  And these guys are managers that could manage the Fridays.  They just know.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, when you're doing a club like Joe does, they appreciate.  They're going, oh, you were great.  You were funny.  One, because they don't, it's not like how many seats you sell.  Right.  You know, they want to get people in.  Okay?  And the good thing for Joe, when he does a place like that, it's one night.  He can't get fired because he's only doing one night. 
[03:27:30]  They can't say, well, you can't do the rest of the week.  Because he goes, hey, guess what?  I'm not here anyhow.  So just give me my fucking money and deal with the garbage I just did up there.  It just sounds like.  I knew there was an insult coming.  Yeah, of course.  Because I was trying to be nice to you, but you went and said for the whole week.  You attacked me first.  Passive-aggressive Mike Babiglia with fucking tits.  Wow.  Go fuck yourself.  All right?  Wow.  You know what I'm saying?  Jesus.  I know what you're saying, Rich.  You've been knocking me all day.  I haven't knocked him in.  I agree with you most of the day.  Did you hear this?  I didn't knock you up to hear how he lies. 
[03:28:00]  How many times did I compliment you today, and how many times did you compliment me?  Every time you compliment me, you're insulting me, and you think that I don't understand  what you're doing.  No.  Your community college joke bombed, so you acted like it wasn't an insult.  It wasn't a bomb.  I was truly, truly saying you have a good vocabulary, and that impresses me.  I don't have a good...  And then you went...  My wife has a good...  And I said, oh, okay, Joe.  But the bottom line is, I truly am impressed by your vocabulary.  Diddy Wiss to say stupid.  She's got a great vocabulary. 
[03:28:30]  And you got physical.  You threw my glasses.  He threw my glasses.  He's a very violent man, Joe DeRosa.  You got to see how he threw my glasses.  I'm telling you, it's like he was frolicking, and he threw it like a fairy throwing dust.  He's fucking a piece of fat shit.  And let me tell you something.  That's why...  Jesus.  All right.  Jesus, Rich.  You just can't be nice for a show.  Jesus Christ.  I'm sorry.  Just guys hanging out, yapping.  He's got to get the little digs in there.  You, Rich.  Oh, you got...  Where are you going? 
[03:29:00]  He's old man.  Where are you going?  Get him the fuck out of here.  I get the fucking digs in.  You know what?  I'm done.  Look, let me tell you something.  I'm not staying here a minute past ten.  What a great time.  I've had a lot of fun today, Joe.  Thanks for showing up.  I'm blessed.  You guys plugging?  Where are you going to be?  Yes.  I'm not going to.  I don't want to plug because I don't want to hear it, but I'm at Marissa's tonight in  Trumbull, Connecticut.  Yes.  And Mohegan's on tomorrow.  And next week, I'm in Arizona.  Fuck, I can't wait, man. 
[03:29:30]  That's nice.  Yeah, I'm doing it.  Like Arizona.  And my CD, still empty inside.  Not one bad review.  Not one.  And all the haters.  Anthony has seen me live.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Just recently.  Yes.  Just recently.  Very funny.  Very fucking funny.  Okay.  Believe me.  Get the fucking CD.  And you know what?  Anybody on that fucking dumb message board, go fuck yourselves.  Not the nice people.  How are you even going to message boards these days?  Because you want to keep in touch with other people.  You keep in touch with other things.  Message boards are a thing of the past.  I know.  But most of the fans that come out are good fans. 
[03:30:00]  Guys that came to Baltimore, they were fucking great.  Joe, where are you going to be?  Yes.  Please follow.  God, I keep saying follow.  Please subscribe to the You Know What Dude podcast on iTunes, riotcast.com.  And I'm going on tour this month in March, mid-March.  Do you have a bus?  Holy shit.  Dude, did I make fun of your fucking plug?  I'm not asking about your tour.  No, you're not.  Stop.  Guy's fucking doing his plugs and Rich can't leave it alone. 
[03:30:30]  I'm going on tour.  You know what?  I'll tell you what, at least on this tour.  Okay, King Crimson.  At least on this tour.  I'm calling it tour because I'm driving for two fucking weeks straight at gigs.  I'm driving from gig to gig.  That's a tour.  What else would you fucking call it?  And guess what?  I'm not playing at any restaurants like you are.  Oh, shit.  Good food.  Good food.  Is it good?  It's good.  Good.  Well, I hope you enjoy eating your paycheck.  He's getting mad.  Why are you getting mad?  I'm not.  I'm fine with you, big cucksucker. 
[03:31:00]  I'm not on a date with you.  Wow, these two are like fucking a snake and a mongoose.  Here's where I have to plug.  Can I get my fucking plug out, please?  If you know the names of your tour clubs.  Okay, I'm touring.  Oh, somewhere in the southeast.  Listen, I'm going to this tour.  It's called the Hey, At Least It's Not Voss Tour.  So please come out to a show.  Because it'll be fun.  No, I, I, I, two weeks.  Stop!  Holy shit, Rich is fucking losing his mind laughing. 
[03:31:30]  Uh-oh.  The Rosa just threw Rich's jacket.  Oh, man, you just drooled all over the place.  Rich.  There was a string of drool.  You look like aliens.  Now he's choking to death.  Oh, stop.  What's wrong with you?  This is a catastrophe.  I'll never pick you on my baseball team.  Oh, fucking God.  All right.  Do you see why we need to have another softball game? 
[03:32:00]  I know, right?  Just to watch DeRosa throw.  Jesus Christ.  That is one girly-ass throw.  We were talking about this in the back office.  We were trying to decide who would be the last people to get picked for teams.  And DeRosa definitely made the bottom.  Without a doubt.  That's why the girl never paid you.  Threw her the check and it didn't reach her.  Oh.  Oh, thank God.  Get out of here, you fucking walking bomb.  All right.  I'm touring through the southeastern states. 
[03:32:30]  I'm leaving in like a week and a half.  It's going to kick off at the lab in Greenville.  South, or is that North Carolina?  I don't know.  The lab in Greenville.  South Carolina.  Then I'm going on to the Laughing Skull in Atlanta.  I'm doing JJ's Bohemia in Tennessee.  I'm doing Nut Street in North Carolina.  Like, go to joderosa.com.  Excuse me, joderosacomedy.com for details.  joderosacomedy.com. 
[03:33:00]  Guys, please come out.  These are going to be really cool.  Cool fucking shows.  Go see Joe.  Oh, you bastards.  No, really.  Yeah.  Well, you can find me at Anthony Cumia at Twitter.  Hi.  And, of course, live from the compound on Ustream and on iTunes.  News and noteworthy.  Just search compound.  Oh, yeah.  Always in there.  I'm going to pop on there tonight and do a little program about something.  In news and noteworthy, as Rich calls it. 
[03:33:30]  News and noteworthy.  Not new and noteworthy.  News and noteworthy.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever it can be.  Rich is pulling out the release.  Now I'll pick you on my team.  Everyone's got a sign to be on the show.  And he just gets ready to write something.  And Joe just smashes his hand on the fucking page.  And it hits the ground.  I guess you didn't tell him about the pen I stuck in your banana, did you?  No, no, I didn't.  That sounds painful.  Riotcast.com.  Riotcast.com.  All right. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Well, thanks, everybody.  Danny Ross, of course.  The lovely Sam Roberts, who's coming up next on The Shit Show right here after.  And E-Rock, happy birthday, wherever he is.  Is he taking a dump?  No.  Ah, shit.  I wish.  Well, then E-Rock takes a dump.  We could play that song.  Do you have anything to say for your birthday, Eric?  Anything, E-Rock, for your birthday, the birthday boy?  Thank you.  That's it?  All right.  Well, happy birthday.  I hope you get something in your card.  You seemed very devastated by that whole affair, didn't he?  Nothing in my cards. 
[03:34:30]  Best Buy card something.  I think they were calling in from Rochester.  Oh, we blew him off, I think.  We were in the middle of talking about how paranoid we were about fucking the government.  I'm going to be looking behind me when I walk out.  Black sedan following me.  Is that what you call them now, sedans?  Yes, sedans.  It really was a shadow government episode.  Yes, it really was.  We've delved into some conspiracy issues.  All right.  Well, I'm done. 
[03:35:00]  I'm going home, and it's the weekend.  Good morning.  Happy Friday.  Good morning to you, and we'll see you Monday.  Thank you.  Oh, look at Hillary.  Look at her face.  What the fuck?  Oh, he's older than the teachers, and he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic.  He's Anthony.  He's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their heinies.  His big delicious cock shouldn't be black.  It's not.  He's Anthony.  Oh, he carries a trapper keeper full of Hitler photographs. 
[03:35:30]  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He tries to be everyone's friend, but he gives all the girls the creeps.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  It's After Opie and Anthony.  Well, maybe just after Anthony Live today.  The great Joe DeRosa in studio, Rich Voss.  Everybody's got a podcast now, too.  Everybody plug in their podcast at the end of the show.  Why didn't you plug yours?  I mean, I didn't feel like it was my place to plug my podcast.  People could find it on iTunes.  You know, it's not what it's about, though.  Okay.  The show went really fast today.  Well, more importantly, Eric. 
[03:36:30]  Your podcast?  It's somebody's birthday today.  Oh, yeah.  You've officially reached middle age.  You're getting to the point.  No.  I feel like that.  I feel like 40 is when you get to that point where it's like, I mean, I think 40 is where  you enter middle age.  Yeah, I'm not 40, though.  What?  I've told you this several times today.  No, you told me last year, I thought.  No, I told you several times today when you pointed out to several people.  The big 4-0.  That I'm not 40. 
[03:37:00]  You're not?  No.  I'm not even close to it.  Well, you're a lot closer than you used to be.  That is true.  But I'm not close to 40 yet.  I assume you look 40.  I mean, you look like a good 40.  Like, oh, he looks pretty good.  But since I'm not 40, I look like a bad 34.  Don't even think about that.  34, that's a lie.  I mean, don't goof around for the radio.  That's serious.  34.  You're not in good shape for 34.  Okay.  But I'm glad it's your birthday. 
[03:37:30]  Are you?  Really?  No, it doesn't make any difference to me.  Exactly.  What are you doing to celebrate?  Nothing.  What do you mean nothing?  I don't know.  What am I going to do?  Celebrate.  You could have your friends over.  Maybe you have your wife put on some nice lingerie or something.  I don't know what you do.  You know, you were a minute ago on the show.  You were complaining that people were giving you birthday cards with no money in them.  No.  So if you expect money from people, it should be something that you want to celebrate.  I wasn't complaining.  It was pointing out that you notice things as you get older. 
[03:38:00]  And I've noticed that, you know, less and less people.  Well, actually, less and less people in your family or whatever send you stuff for your birthday.  But more people, thanks to Facebook, now don't even bother.  Yeah.  Because, hey, I posted on your wall because my event calendar said it was your birthday.  And that's good enough.  I'm guilty of that as well.  But that's the thing now.  Well, you just said you're not celebrating it.  I'm not.  I don't know if I'm going to do anything.  If you're not celebrating it, I don't – why would people send you presents if it's not even worth you celebrating? 
[03:38:30]  Because nobody knew I wasn't celebrating it until today.  But obviously now people are like, oh, yeah, of course I should.  Because you're like saying people should send you stuff.  Oh, I'm not.  Loved ones.  Yes, you are.  No.  I said I noticed as time goes on you don't get it – you don't get all the attention.  And I understand it when you would as a kid and when, you know, you're younger.  But you're not taking one stance one way or the other about it.  What am I going to do?  Whether it's good or bad. 
[03:39:00]  Call up my family.  We're like, where's my fucking card?  Jay in Huntington says, can Eric have one day?  It's his goddamn birthday.  Eric sits down in the studio now in front of me, in front of a microphone.  Do you want me to not acknowledge him?  It's his birthday.  We're having a conversation about it.  Do you feel like I'm being harsh on you?  No, but I think the saying that I'm 40 is unnecessary.  I didn't know for sure.  I don't have –  You knew several times.  I don't have –  You poked your head in during one of the breaks and go, 40, right?  I go, no. 
[03:39:30]  I don't have the greatest memory on earth.  I never claimed to be – this is why I didn't get into math.  I couldn't memorize my multiplication tables.  And it's the same thing.  I'm not good with numbers and sometimes I forget.  So I just go on instinct.  And my instinct would say –  But meanwhile, you can remember any time somebody on this show fucks up that you know where  to go and pull it, especially like if Mars did something or I did something.  You know damn well where that stuff is and when it was.  I guess I'm somewhat of a savant in that way, yes.  No, you're an idiot is what it is. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  And so being that I'm an idiot, I don't know how old you are.  So I would – you know, my instinct, my gut tells me –  Okay, we're going in circles here.  40 years old.  Not 40.  Howard in Tennessee, welcome to After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, Sam, you like busting E-Roc's balls over weight and all that.  You bet I do.  What does your girlfriend, Jess, feel like when you'd rather sit there and play with  a WWE doll than –  Well, I don't play with WWE dolls, Mr. Lawler. 
[03:40:30]  No, but Lawler's all right.  You know, hell, he makes more money than you do.  I would assume he probably makes more money than you do too.  What do you do that you make more money than Jerry the King –  But, I mean, look at what you're doing, Sam.  You're talking – why don't you talk about what your woman wears?  What about your woman banging Troy?  You might brought that up.  Eric, are you offended that I've never spoken about Jess banging Troy?  Actually, yes.  I would love to hear about it.  I mean, you know, what did your woman do when she went over to that one country? 
[03:41:00]  You mean when Jess went to Brazil and we talked on this show ad nauseum  – Howard, listen.  Listen, Howard.  The man is speaking.  We spoke ad nauseum about Jess banging guys in Brazil.  That's all anyone was talking about.  I know.  All right, so then how is it – how can I not say that somebody else's wife is banging someone?  You keep bringing it up about E-Rox woman. 
[03:41:30]  So you're saying I can take it and dish it out.  Howard, you're saying – you're saying – you're saying not only can I –  you're saying I receive it and I give it out.  Is that what you're saying?  You know what you are?  You are.  What am I, Howard?  You're an Opie wannabe.  That's right.  I was just thinking the other day.  I was listening to the show and I was looking at Opie.  As a matter of fact, you know what I did today?  No.  I booked a plane ticket to Rochester just because I heard that he did that yesterday.  Can I ask you one question?  Yes, you may.  I listen to you on a Sunday show. 
[03:42:00]  Hell of a good show.  Thank you very much.  Did you ever do that interview with Abdullah?  With who?  Abdullah the Butcher.  No, but I – I mean, I don't know where he is.  He's never in – on the East Coast.  Well, you said he was coming up there in – I think it was in March for some kind of a –  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, that's actually next weekend.  I wonder if he will be there.  I have to check in on that.  And if I do, I'm going to try to get him.  Well, I appreciate that.  All right.  Thank you.  Y'all have a good one.  Thank you, Howard.  You see – you see the relationship I have with the people, Eric? 
[03:42:30]  It ended nicely.  This is what I'm talking about.  We both get to speak our pieces.  We speak honestly and openly and then –  Well, he was speaking honestly and openly.  You were mocking his accent.  I was doing the little Andy Kaufman.  Yeah.  But what he said – this is what drives me crazy.  What he said was, why don't we ever talk about just banging other people?  And then he brought up a time when –  Then just banged Troy.  And then he brought up a time.  He said, why don't you ever talk about when your woman bangs other people, right? 
[03:43:00]  And then he brought up a time when we as a show specifically spoke about my woman banging other people.  That's the only point to mentioning that she was away.  Right.  Yeah.  So as much as I dish it out, I take it too.  And maybe if you guys like Howard would stop focusing so much on when I'm talking to Abdullah the Butcher next  and more on what's actually going on around you, you wouldn't be so critical.  That's what I took away from it. 
[03:43:30]  That was my takeaway.  He's sitting here worried about, listen, I love everything that you do.  There's one thing missing from the equation.  Abdullah the Butcher.  Abdullah the Butcher.  I'm working on it, Howard.  I'm not a magician.  I got Eric in here.  Yeah.  Paul, by the way, Paul just wrote a note that said, what about the hundreds of times we spoke to or about your mother?  Hundreds.  It's been, it's ridiculous the things that we've put that woman through.  And she's fed up with it. 
[03:44:00]  I was talking to her at dinner the other night and she was talking about the last time she called in where the phone call didn't go as well as it usually does.  When she said, I'm not going to talk about Sam's penis, which I think is her prerogative as a mother, is that she's not going to talk about Sam's penis.  And when she was sitting there at the dinner table, Paul complaining about you who doesn't have, because she's brought up that E-Rock plays the radio producer game of, oh, I'm sure it'll be nice.  The guys just want to talk to you, but she said Eric kind of pulls it off. 
[03:44:30]  That's his job and he does it well.  She said, you, she goes, Paul calls her and he goes, hi, because this is when they were talking about, back when I had a foreskin at the age of 18.  And, uh, and they were talking about, you know, the genetics, the, the biology of it, we'll say.  Okay.  Um, Paul calls up and my mother had been listening to the show and he goes, hi, uh, uh, is this Mrs. Roberts?  Uh, we, we'd like to get you on the air to talk about Sam. 
[03:45:00]  And she said, he said, this is Paul from Opie and Anthony.  And she said, Paul, I'm not going to talk about Sam's penis.  And Paul said, oh no, no, that's not what they want to talk to you about.  And my mom said, who the fuck are you talking to?  Well, no, I, I, I wrote that on the, on the screen that she didn't want to talk about your penis.  You know, I told the guys, I did, I did.  You're just the messenger.  I am.  Do you think this was another instance of burning a bridge?  Did we burn a bridge with your mom? 
[03:45:30]  No, it's impossible.  You know why this show will never burn a bridge with my mom?  She's the sweetest lady ever.  Because your dad likes her on the air?  No, no, that, that actually helps burn the bridge more.  The fact that my dad gets a kick out of it makes my mom not want to do it.  And she thinks that it's helpful to my career to, you know, embarrass herself.  Not realizing it's embarrassing me too.  It does nothing for me at this point.  She doesn't have to do it anymore.  Yeah.  Poor lady.  I know.  She's just, what'd you say? 
[03:46:00]  Carrot cake?  Okay, yeah.  Roland always, Roland likes to throw out mother jokes at me, except he always ends the, your  mom this.  Also, could you bring in some carrot cake soon?  Because it's delicious.  Brett in Maryland.  Yes, this is the shit show.  No, you have the wrong number.  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  And I'm Sam Roberts.  Oh, you're the shit stirrer.  I just wanted to say that you can't take enough shit to entertain me. 
[03:46:30]  I love it.  Every time you get smashed, I really enjoy it.  Keep up the hideous work in E-Rock.  Get some balls, brother.  That's right.  Hey, don't shit on E-Rock.  You don't take enough shit, Brett in Maryland.  Your college has a turtle for a mascot.  What do you expect?  Some kind of terrapin.  I don't know what it is.  How do you feel when people say you need to grow a set of balls?  They've been saying that for eight years. 
[03:47:00]  The whole time you've been with the show, people say, E-Rock, grow a fucking set of balls.  Whether it's the callers, whether it's Troy Kwan, whether it's Opie himself.  They go, E-Rock, grow a set of goddamn balls.  What do you say?  I got a good-looking wife and a nice house.  And, guess what?  We've seen him in his boxer briefs, and he's got a heavy scrotum.  I'll just say that.  I can tell from the bulge.  I didn't weigh it.  I can just tell from the bulge.  My friend, Marcos and Yonkers.  By the way, Marcos and Yonkers. 
[03:47:30]  He wished me happy birthday on Twitter.  He, Marcos, used to call when I did special delivery on Saturday nights.  He used to call every Saturday.  Since I've been doing the Sam Roberts show on Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern,  here on this channel, not one call from Marcos.  None.  Apparently his phones don't work on Sundays.  Wasn't Marcos to you like that Tony guy is to Eastside Dave?  No, because Tony calls in on Sundays.  Oh, poor Marcos.  Marcos, stop calling me.  Sam, I work on Sunday, brother.  I drive for a living. 
[03:48:00]  You drive for a living.  You know where they have satellite radios these days?  In trucks.  Cars.  Cars, Marcos.  Get a satellite radio in your car.  I've got...  Listen to this lineup.  They haven't been planes.  Listen to this.  Yeah, they haven't been airplanes now.  Listen to this lineup.  I've got Kurt Schilling, major league, former major league baseball pitcher, now the owner  of a video game company.  Kurt Schilling.  World champion.  World champion.  World series.  World series.  He's going to be on the show in studio this week, as is Dr. Ruth, world champion of sex  advice at 83 years old. 
[03:48:30]  Both of those people are going to be on the Sam Roberts show this Sunday, and you don't  call me anymore, Marcos.  Dude, I listen to your podcast, you know?  I do listen to the podcast.  Ah, it's not about mentioning that.  It's on iTunes.  They can find it there.  So what's up, Marcos?  I was calling in because I tried to get a happy birthday E-Rock trending on Twitter.  New York fucks are very lazy, and I only got like five or six retweets.  I can't believe this.  With the power of Marcos from Yonkers, you couldn't get hashtag happy birthday E-Rock trending. 
[03:49:00]  I would think they would do it for the love of the sex bagel, but no.  You think so?  The sex man, I guess, maybe people just aren't aware of it enough.  Find Marcos on Yonkers, from Yonkers.  What's your Twitter address?  Well, it's MarcoFRMYonkers.  MarcoFRMYonkers.  So it's not Marcos, it's Marco.  Yeah, I couldn't fit the whole thing. 
[03:49:30]  It's one of the things.  You couldn't be like Marcos from Y.O.?  Well, a lot of people don't know what Y.O. is.  Only Westchester people know that.  9-1-4 in this bitch.  Yeah, boy.  This guy's doing the his-out.  It's Marco, FRM, Yonkers.  Thank you, Marco.  Remember we had that dumb intern who used to walk around going, Y.O.?  No, who?  Remember Ricky?  No, I wasn't here for Ricky.  Oh, you weren't here for Ricky?  You brought him out.  When we did the Hard Rock show and we did the after show live from the Hard Rock, you brought 
[03:50:00]  out Ricky as my special guest and I couldn't have cared less.  By the way, Paul, I'll get to your special guest in a minute.  Don't you worry about it over there on the couch.  Kevin in Houston.  Hey, man.  How's it going, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  I don't know why everybody's shitting on you.  I mean, your show's actually pretty good.  No, I'm an easy target.  I mean, it's a good show now.  Well, thank you very much, Kevin.  It wasn't at first.  You've got to admit that.  No, it was shit at first.  You've got to give me time to grow. 
[03:50:30]  You people out there, you've got to give me a second to grow.  All right, later, man.  That's what people don't understand about me.  I'm not very good at anything I do at first, but eventually I grow into doing something.  Speaking of that, growing into things and updates and watching how people grow.  Paul, you, we had you in, I think it was earlier this week, like Monday, here on After Open Anthony Live.  And we were talking about things that interns have done. 
[03:51:00]  Because intern Sal, who is, you know, Mr. Oh, I know how to run a board, as if that's a useful skill.  Like, oh, I have great turnaround time because I made the Anthony song production very quickly that helped the show today.  I threw an instrumental behind it.  Anyone could have done that.  Yeah, Mr. Like, oh, I'll help you with whatever you need.  But when push comes to shove, have you rethought, Sal, the intern, have you rethought whether or not you would clean up the shit if we do the Cleveland steamer bit? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, I definitely thought about it.  Okay, and what have you come to?  I still won't do it.  What a failure.  This is ridiculous.  This is insane.  I can't believe this.  Well, Paul, when we got this conversation going, you came in and talked about all the things that you had done as an intern.  Yeah, all the things I had to clean up.  Yeah, and maybe that's because you lack the other skills that Sal has.  I don't know, like the practical radio skills that Sal possesses.  The ones that would actually be useful. 
[03:52:00]  Right, you lack those.  So I don't know what it is.  I don't know how the equation works out, but we brought up you cleaning up an intern who pissed himself.  Yes.  And by his pants and everything, and that, of course, was intern Evan.  To me, intern Evan never made as much of a splash on the air as he did behind the scenes.  Oh, definitely not.  People don't realize this.  My top three interns are intern David, who we talk about all the time. 
[03:52:30]  Yes.  Cream Pie Jones, who we talk about quite often.  That's Big Boy Made a Duty.  The kid who claims he can't get a job now because there are internet videos of him playing with feces.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not.  And intern Evan is my third in my top three.  But intern Evan barely did anything on the air.  If you're a longtime listener, you might remember him as Swivel Hips.  I doubt it.  But I'll tell you this.  Evan's here.  Evan, welcome back. 
[03:53:00]  Feels good to be back.  It does.  This is a kid who I was talking about on Monday who always had confidence in whatever he was doing, even if it was dead wrong.  And even while he was failing miserably.  He never would admit he was wrong.  As he was failing, it was just whatever he said would always be with such conviction.  Do you still have that conviction?  Absolutely.  You see what I'm saying?  Do you hear it in his voice?  You can't miss it.  And Evan and Paul, when they were both interns, used to get in. 
[03:53:30]  And this is why I don't like that the after show, after Open Anthony Live, wasn't around two or three years ago.  Because when Evan and Paul were interns, they would get in to these massive arguments behind the scenes to the point – get Steve Sturniolo right there.  Yeah, go grab him, Paul.  They would get into these massive arguments in the hallway here and just entertain people at their desks.  What was it about Paul – well, let's get Steve in here. 
[03:54:00]  Steve's excited.  Because Steve – I was – this is Steve Sturniolo.  He works for Raw Dog.  He's been on the show a few times.  Oh, Evan.  So good to see – is that Sal on the board?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  This is – no, he's on the board, but he rocks in there next to him, massaging him.  I don't know why he needs that.  It's good to see you.  How's it going?  I was telling him that Evan never made much of a splash on the air except for when he was swivel hips and when he pissed himself.  And why were you pissing yourself? 
[03:54:30]  What were you trying to prove?  Well, I didn't piss myself previous.  I was pissing – let me tell you, Sam and I have frequent conversations about how I miss the – when you guys first came up here, like those groups of interns, because they were fun.  I told him – I was telling the listeners that Evan and Paul here – and this is why I regret that there was no after show at the time – used to get in to these massive arguments.  The best fights – some of the best fights I've ever seen in –  Over nothing. 
[03:55:00]  It was – you two were the biggest cunts ever arguing.  And, like, stupidest shit ever.  And Paul would act like he was above it all, even though he was deeply entrenched in this argument.  Like, they were both there.  They argued who was, like, better and less useless, and Sam would just – you would literally – Sam was at his best when inciting them to continue to argue.  They would go for hours.  I know, and then Sam would sometimes walk out of the argument that he helped start and then would walk back in when it was starting to die down just to start it up again. 
[03:55:30]  Well, I didn't want it to stop.  I just had things to do.  Oh, and I remember, Evan, didn't you start some business and you had business cards, some sort of computer business or something?  Oh, yeah.  That had to fall, like, flat on its face.  Oh, it's going pretty well, actually.  Pretty well?  Oh, yeah, I can tell.  I can tell by your look.  You're starting a new business.  Oh, what kind of –  Wait, wait.  You're starting a new business or you've started a new business?  I've started a new business.  What's it called?  We're called GadgetRx.  GadgetRx.  I like that.  It's like – I'm going to guess.  Prescription, gadgets, so what are you, selling pills on the computer? 
[03:56:00]  Close.  We fix electronics.  What's the – oh, the Rx is, I guess, to –  Like a doctor fixes people.  Like a doctor fixes people.  Evan, I have to ask you, you said we.  How many people are on this business venture?  There's two other people.  They're paying for all of it.  Are you guys in the green yet?  Have you made money?  We haven't made any money yet.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Have you personally lost money?  No, actually, I'm the only one that made money because I sold all the scrap metal that 
[03:56:30]  we found in the new place that we rented.  Oh, my God.  Wait, wait, wait.  This is like a real place.  You rented a building?  Yeah.  In Merrick, we have a space.  Do you have a – where are you living?  At home still.  With?  My parents.  Okay.  How old are you?  25.  Oh, that's not bad.  I moved out at 24.  Yeah.  I mean, you had a gig.  Yeah, I had a job.  I had a job.  There wasn't convincing other people to start a company and then selling scrap metal to them.  You know what that seems like?  The homeless guys that go around looking for copper tubing.  Right.  You know what I mean?  To sell that.  That's what it sounds like, Evan.  Do you feel, Evan, do you feel successful? 
[03:57:00]  Yeah.  You do.  I've been spending thousands of dollars that aren't mine on things that I would like to buy.  How did you convince these people to do that?  Because I worked with one of them, and I guess my skills were apparent, and I was asked to be a part of this new project.  They said, listen, this kid doesn't have any money to invest, but his skills – was it your skills or the fact that you said – you described yourself with such confidence and such conviction that they said he can't be full of shit, not realizing that you are indeed full of shit? 
[03:57:30]  Well, I can't deny that I've played a role in it.  But that's how I have to go about my life.  Tell me this, Evan.  Yeah.  So you started this company.  I mean, this is just something where you're spending other people's money to get cool gadgets.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you're working on this.  Is there a sign on the store, or is it just a building?  No.  There is a sign.  A signage.  Where is the store?  It's in Merrick, right by the Merrick train station.  Okay, so at the Merrick train station in Long Island. 
[03:58:00]  Yes.  Are you in the store?  I am in the store most of the time.  Who's in the store right now?  The other two.  Yeah.  Oh, the other two.  So Gadgets Rx, and this is what people need to explain the power of this show.  Anyone on Long Island, go into Gadgets Rx and ask for Evan.  And say, Evan, didn't you piss yourself in the bar that time?  And Evan, what will you say?  I will say, absolutely.  No, no, no, no.  In the bar.  No, no.  And they will say, prove it.  And how will you prove it? 
[03:58:30]  Well, if that video is still available, I'll show them that first.  But if not, I'll have to pee myself again.  Because what happened, Steve Sterniolo, was there was a photo of him with what appeared  to be a urine stain on his pants.  And to prove that it wasn't a urine stain on his pants, he made a urine stain on his pants.  No, I have to ask, though.  Seeing these two back together brings back so much nostalgia.  Sure, sure.  So, I guess Paul's better than Evan at this because Paul got hired.  Well, here's the question. 
[03:59:00]  Paul is not a full-time member of the Opie and Anthony show.  By any stretch of the imagination.  By any stretch of the imagination.  And no one would ever make him that.  Literally, there are interns, and by that I mean Sal, who are closer to being full-time  members of the Opie and Anthony show than Paul is.  That said, he's closer to being a full-time member of the show than, say, Mr. Gadgets Rx, Evan.  Evan, Paul got hired, he's an hourly employee now at SiriusXM, one step away from full-time. 
[03:59:30]  That's the bridge.  That's the purgatory.  You know what I mean?  A big step.  Like, your life is being an intern.  Purgatory is an hourly employee, and then you get to heaven, or hell, which is working  at SiriusXM, and that's just an afterlife thing.  I'll let you be the judge of that.  But, Evan, why do you think, of all the interns, Paul was hired to be an hourly employee and 
[04:00:00]  not someone like you?  Probably because he kept applying after I stopped.  Ooh.  You think that was all it was?  I think if I kept applying, I would have actually got some position.  I got the job when you were still applying.  Ooh.  So you're saying it's persistence, not skill.  I've worked with a company for almost two years.  I don't know if that's necessarily true.  Wait, wait, wait, Evan.  You're telling me that the fact, like, Paul got a job because it was timing, and if when  they were looking for an hourly employee specifically, if they had been handed a resume from Paul, 
[04:00:30]  a resume from Evan, and an interview from both of you, who would have gotten that job?  Oh, man.  I have an excellent resume.  You would have definitely gotten it.  And my interview skills are, I would say, above the average.  Paul, he is saying that the reason that you're here is strictly timing, and that he would  have beaten you for that job.  Um, I've already proven that's completely untrue.  Now, Evan, you see what Paul's saying here is that the evidence that he has is that he actually 
[04:01:00]  has the job in question, like the job that you guys would both theoretically interview  for.  He interviewed for and received.  He got the job.  You understand his retort.  I also see defeat to him in that respect, but I don't feel like I lost, ultimately.  Why is that?  I feel happy in my life.  I feel the experience I had only bettered me.  Now, Evan, if I remember correctly, at one point while you were an intern, your parents  threw you out of your house because you took a bunch of pills, you got all lined up, and 
[04:01:30]  you trashed your room.  Is this correct?  Well, that's my theory.  What happened was I was asleep.  Apparently, in my sleep, I trashed my room.  You were sleepwalking and you destroyed your room.  Yes.  But you had taken a ton of Ritalin before you went to sleep.  Well, Adderall, and it wasn't because I took it before I sleep, because I probably didn't 
[04:02:00]  sleep for two days.  Okay.  So.  And Evan, you always had, that was always your cycle, is that you'd sleep.  48-hour cycle.  Yeah.  Most human beings operate on the 24-hour.  Sterniolo, I don't know if you're aware of this, but they operate on 24 hours with  eight hours of sleep.  Evan, you always preferred 48 with 16.  Well, because if I went to sleep, it would be almost impossible to get up in time.  Now, Paul, how many days a week do you come in to do the Opie and Anthony show?  Five.  And what time do you get here? 
[04:02:30]  Roughly 5.30.  Okay.  A couple minutes.  So, how do you work that out on a 48-hour schedule?  I go to sleep about 8, 9 o'clock at night.  If I have a late night, 10 o'clock, so I get, what is that, 7 to 9 hours of sleep?  So you actually worked it out on a 24-hour schedule.  24-hour schedule.  Evan, do you think maybe the reason you didn't get a job was the 48-hour thing?  No.  You don't think so?  Wasn't that a severe problem of his coming in on time?  Actually, yeah.  I mean, he missed several days.  That's why I would stay up to get in on time.  Literally, one of the most important things of being an intern, literally the one thing 
[04:03:00]  bosses look at, it goes, can he show up on time?  That's first step one.  I show up on time most of the time.  But see, that's not good.  And by most, you mean over 50%.  When I did three days a week, most of the time, when I tried to stretch that to a little  more, things got a little hairy.  Yeah.  Can I just say, since you guys moved up here, the office has become so much more fun.  Yeah, but it's less fun than it was when these two...  When these two, that's what I was going to say.  From the memories of good interns being around, number one, David, obviously, at all costs, 
[04:03:30]  anything he's ever done, eating a sheet cake was number one, an entire sheet cake.  You two fighting, number two on my list, by far.  Do you agree that intern David is the number one intern of all time, or do you dispute that  title?  David's a gem.  I can't say anything more about him.  What about Cream Pie Jones is number two?  I mean, I don't have too much memories of memorable bits he was associated with.  You're saying you are a little bit more memorable.  Slightly. 
[04:04:00]  Sam, where do these rank on your...  I know you've done intern lists before, but where do these guys rank?  Paul doesn't rank, and David's number one, Cream Pie Jones number two, and Evan number  three.  You believe number two is your spot.  Yeah.  I'd say they're a package deal.  They're both number two for me, because they need to be fighting for me to really enjoy them.  One person's asking which intern made the song Julia.  That was not either of these two.  That was intern Noah.  You can find Julia on YouTube.  Noah Ross, I think his last name was. 
[04:04:30]  Julia spelt J-E-W-L-I-A.  It's a pun, you see.  I get it.  It's a music video that he did.  Listen, Evan, I would talk to you all day, but they went short on breaks, so I gotta leave  early today.  And I'd listen.  I'd listen to every second of you interviewing Evan.  Is there anything...  We got GadgetsRx in Merrick Long Island by the train station.  Yeah, GadgetsRx.com.  Is there anything that you'd like to say to the management here at SiriusXM that, quite  frankly, overlooked you?  I think perhaps they could maybe give a harder look into their application and hiring process. 
[04:05:00]  You think the problem is with the process?  Better get a little more personal.  That's it.  Well, listen.  You got a website coming soon.  You're well on your way.  Ring of Honor is doing their 10th anniversary show at the Hammerstein Ballroom this Sunday.  I would recommend everybody goes there.  Sam Roberts show this Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern right here on this channel.  Dr. Ruth and Curt Schilling on the show.  Well done.  That'll be great. 
[04:05:30]  So will Ron and Fez.  And that's coming up next.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
