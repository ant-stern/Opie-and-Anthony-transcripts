<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the sabotage of their WNEW van, whose tire had come off in Manhattan, leaving employees Stinky and Pete stranded.  The hosts speculated about possible culprits, ranging from rivals to disgruntled individuals, fueled by the fact that all eight lug nuts were missing.  Numerous listener calls offered various theories, some attributing the incident to incompetence, others to malicious intent, and one caller even claimed to have seen Pete tampering with the tire earlier that day.  The discussion included anecdotes of similar tire incidents, including near-fatal accidents.  The hosts also heavily promoted their upcoming road show, mentioning guests such as Stephen Lynch, Fuel, and Q, and detailing plans for an air show by Paul the Pilot.  A caller jokingly confessed to the van sabotage, followed by a prank call from a fake Rob Halford.  The segment concluded with a Sobe beverage sponsorship plug and further road show details, including the possibility of attending a sticker stop event and the search for a replacement van, with a listener offering their own car.

The show continued with a call from Louis Black, vacationing in Puerto Rico, complaining about his resort and voicing disappointment with both Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani in the New York Senate race. They jokingly proposed running a dog for office.  The conversation shifted back to the road show, confirming Jeff Norris, Eddie Otto, Big Billy Hayes, and Stephen Lynch as guests. Pete, a 41-year veteran employee, recounted the van incident. Jeff Norris was assigned to find a replacement van for the "WOW" sticker stop.

Next, a call from "Old Dirty" followed, detailing his job search, humorous employment anecdotes, and a conflict with a co-worker, Earl, rumored to be quitting.  Old Dirty also discussed his personal life, including fathering multiple children.  This segment concluded with a surprise birthday celebration for Opie, featuring Patty Flesham, a newsroom employee, who exposed her breasts on air.  Stephen Lynch called in to preview a song for the road show, mentioning the possibility of including "F***ing Bitch Ass."  The segment was punctuated by heavy use of vulgar and sexually explicit language.

Opie's birthday celebration continued with the "What Would You Do for Stockbroker Dave's Money?" segment, featuring oversized fruits and vegetables.  A phone call with Andrew Dice Clay devolved into a profanity-laden argument with Shane McMahon, filled with insults, personal attacks, and sexually suggestive remarks. Dice Clay repeatedly used his catchphrase, "I'm over here now." Shane McMahon eventually hung up.  The segment also included a call from a listener who almost had an accident while listening to the Dice Clay/Shane McMahon call, and a brief check-in with Big Cab promoting a WOW sticker event at a GameStop. A call from Jay Moore was cut short.  Announcements about the upcoming road show were interspersed throughout.

The birthday celebration continued with more surprise guests. "Gay Marco," wearing revealing shorts, delivered a sexually suggestive birthday poem and gifts including pornography and a Heineken six-pack with a rainbow flag.  Stockbroker Dave participated in the "Win Stockbroker Dave's Money" game, along with two women from the "Privilege" gentlemen's club, who engaged in increasingly explicit acts with a giant carrot and asparagus for money.  Opie eventually left the studio due to the increasingly outrageous events.  Sandy, Opie's girlfriend, presented him with a scrapbook of newspaper articles about the show. Jay Moore called in, recounting a bizarre film experience with Lyra Flynn Boyle and James Spader and a friend's strip-search in Calgary.  Dice also had another lengthy, rambling call, reportedly arguing with Shane McMahon.

Finally, the show announced a Thursday road show at the South Beach Dance Club in Island Park, starting at 2 PM for those 21 and older with no cover charge.  Dave's absence due to a trip to Mexico was noted, with the hosts jokingly promising to bring a comically large carrot to the event in his honor.  The segment concluded with a call to action for listeners to call in, punctuated with insults.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both.  Look at that weirdo.  1027 WNEW.  It's the ONA show.  It is.  Barely the ONA show today.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  Hello, Anthony.  Hey, Opie.  How are you?  Very good.  Good, good, good. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  Well, it seems we had a little incident.  I could just read a couple of instant feedbacks.  Yeah.  It'll explain itself.  Bob from Manhattan.  I just watched the WNEW van lose a tire on 39th between 5th and 6th.  The driver looked like he S'd himself.  Yeah.  Another guy.  The WNEW van is crippled on 39th Street between 5th and 6th. 
[00:01:00]  The tire came off while he was driving.  No lug nuts holding the tire on.  No lug nuts.  Hmm.  Stinky was in the van and almost perished today.  And Pete.  If their families are listening, they're okay.  Everything is fine.  No injuries to report.  The crippled bomber made it back to the airfield.  But Stinky, man, he really wants the airtime, I guess.  Yeah, really. 
[00:01:30]  Stinky, get on mic.  You undoing the lug nuts just so we can put you on the air?  Get over there, Stinky.  Over there.  It's high school of broadcast.  I know.  He doesn't know it's Mike to grab.  So what happened, Stinky?  He's a little shook.  He's shaken up, I think.  Tell us the story.  From the beginning, you guys left the station to do what?  To check out where the road trail was being held and check the ISDN line out to see if it was working.  Right.  Yeah.  So you had to drive all the way to Island Park on Long Island.  Yep.  South Beach Dance Club doing the live broadcast Thursday. 
[00:02:00]  And then everything went fine there, right?  Yeah, it looks great.  It's right on, not the ocean, but the water.  There's docks and everything.  It's a nice place.  Cool.  Thank you, Stinky.  Very good.  So then you got back into the WNEW van, right?  Mm-hmm.  And then what happened?  You made it all the way back to the city?  Yeah, right through.  Uh-huh.  And we were going across 36th Street, and we got stuck in the grid. 
[00:02:30]  So we made a right up Fifth Avenue.  And it was a tight right because we were trying to get out of the grid, and we heard a grinding noise.  Mm-hmm.  So we kept going.  And we didn't think anything about it.  Made our next left to keep going across town.  Hit a bump, and all of a sudden the van tips on toward the front side, and the wheel goes shooting off in front of us.  It hits a car in front of us.  Oh, man.  So the wheel flew off the WNEW van. 
[00:03:00]  Yep.  Now, from the looks of it, it looked like the lug nuts were, like, loosened or not on.  It looked like that.  Some, I don't know, I'm not really good with cars, but it just looked like the lug nuts weren't on there,  and wherever the tire was being held on just got stripped and ripped right off.  Like, they must have been loosened, and it was vibrating, and vibrated away all the threads on the lug nuts,  and then finally the rest of the nuts just came off. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, because we could only find one lug nut by the scene of the accident.  Interesting.  That is, uh...  So someone sabotaged our van.  That's what it sounds like.  Lug nuts don't just come off.  Let's not sugarcoat this.  Someone sabotaged our van, and these guys could have got really hurt, killed.  You could have been killed or killed someone else.  You were only going, what, 10 or 15 miles an hour?  10 or 15 miles an hour, yeah.  When the wheel went flying off.  Do people think, when they do stuff like this, like a tire flying across a road could go right into a pedestrian or a windshield, 
[00:04:00]  and then there'd be a big police investigation, maybe surveillance cameras that would see someone effing with the tires.  Who knows?  And then all of a sudden, you think it was all funny, and then you're getting butt-raped in prison because you killed somebody.  That's hysterical.  Because only about 20 minutes before this happened, they were going about 60, 65 miles an hour on the Long Island Expressway. 
[00:04:30]  That's right.  What?  People don't think.  Idiot down the hall just came in and told us something.  He could have been involved somehow.  Mark could have been involved?  In an outside way, he could have been involved.  Mark, get back in here.  What?  What is he talking about?  Wait till you know what he did.  No!  It wasn't my fault!  Don't say what station, just say what you did.  No, on my way, yes, the van was driving beautiful yesterday, might I add, when I took it to the sticker stop. 
[00:05:00]  But I was on my way there, and I saw that particular other station that we...  Don't even worry about.  We know who we're talking about, but I saw their pickup truck, and I gave them the old, you know, one-finger salute.  But they wouldn't have gone into our garage and done that, even though they parked their vehicle there, too.  Somebody sabotaged our van.  Yeah, someone did.  Lug nuts don't fall off a car.  Eight of them don't just fall off a car.  Yeah, eight don't just fall off.  The tire hadn't recently been changed for a flat or anything, so it's not like someone didn't tighten it up. 
[00:05:30]  Somebody loosened the lug nuts and could have killed somebody.  That's great.  That's real thinking.  When you're giggling, taking off lug nuts, you know, you might have killed somebody.  All of a sudden, there goes someone else's life because they're dead, and then you're in prison getting the old Louisiana black snake.  And poor Pete is queen of the weight room prom.  Pete's been working for this radio station for like 35 years.  Never drives the van.  Just wants to retire, you know, just wants to punch the clock, get his job done, and go home. 
[00:06:00]  And he was scared S-less.  He called my phone today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just losing it.  Is Pete okay now?  He seemed to be right, yeah.  He was just shocked, you know.  He didn't know what to do.  All of a sudden, death of a situation.  Well, he must have had a flashback because five years ago, he rolled his car on the Jersey turnpike.  So he must have had like a Vietnam flag back. 
[00:06:30]  Like, oh, here it goes again.  Good thing you guys are going slow.  There's nothing worse than driving, especially at speed, and just seeing a tire go to the side and go, hey, where'd that come from?  Then you realize the front of your car is going down.  Uh-oh.  That's mine.  That's just scary.  That is just scary.  Bobby, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  I saw who did it.  Who?  The Invisible Man.  Ah, Bobby.  The Invisible Man.  Take it easy, guys.  Later.  Yeah, maybe someone had it out for Earl and thought he'd be driving it. 
[00:07:00]  Dave, what's going on?  Even though it could have been a narrowly missed catastrophe, we do love a war.  We don't know who did it.  Oh, come on.  Who did it yet.  We really don't know who did it.  We'll find out.  And there will be retribution.  We will find out.  Lug nuts just don't get loosened.  No, not eight of them.  Not eight of them.  Not even two of them.  No.  Every once in a while, when you get a flat, you might find one or two that are a little 
[00:07:30]  loose.  But not eight that are loosened off the wheel.  I guess they just wanted to up the ante.  See what we're made of, the army.  All right, Dave.  Be good.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Please warm up the Enola Gay.  It's time to drop the A-bomb.  Go figure.  Stinky probably smelled so bad, the car keeled over.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, you're next on NAW.  How are you? 
[00:08:00]  How are you doing?  Good.  This is Tim.  Yeah.  Listen, I work for EMS downtown Manhattan.  I saw Mark driving like a maniac yesterday.  Really?  At that sticker stop.  He was weaving in and out of traffic.  He must have drove around the block like 30 times.  Oh, sorry about that.  Watch that S-word.  Watch the S-word.  He was driving like a maniac.  Yeah, we all know.  He was cool, though.  He gave us some stickers and stuff.  Right.  All right.  Just thought I'd let you guys know.  Maybe he's in on it.  All right.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Later.  Bye. 
[00:08:30]  Let's go to Margaret.  Margaret, what's going on?  Hello?  Hi, Margaret.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  The same thing happened to me.  When I was in high school, I took this Bohack auto repair class.  So we used to go across the street to the diner and hang out, you know.  We kind of blew off the class, did a little smoke and went back to class.  Yeah.  I had my friend's car up on the lift, me and my girlfriend.  Okay.  And they let us do a brake job.  So we took the tires off the side of the car, and like three months later, the guy lost 
[00:09:00]  his tire on the exit ramp of a parkway because he didn't tighten the lug nuts tight enough,  blew off, crashed into the front of another guy's car.  The teacher got fired.  The school got sued.  It was a complete catastrophe.  Oh, great.  So you can do something like months before if they had a tune-up done of something or the  tire taken off, and then months later, it can come off.  So it might not have been a sabotage. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  Well, we've got to figure it out because that's just sick.  I know.  I know.  My friend called me up screaming at me.  He got sued.  Everyone got sued.  All right.  Well, thank you, Margaret.  Bye.  Bye.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I say Rick has something to do with it.  Rick has something to do with it?  Yeah.  Inside job.  All right.  Thanks.  I don't believe this guy, but we'll go to him anyway.  Lee, what's up?  Hey, O&A.  How are you?  I was down in Island Park, down at the bar. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And the driver was screwing around with the front wheels.  What do you mean?  Why would Pete screw around with the wheels?  I don't know.  Ask him.  I was down there with him.  He gave me three stickers.  So he would unscrew the lug nuts.  What did he look like?  On the van.  He was an awful-looking guy with glasses.  He had on a black jacket, black and, like, gold-looking.  That's Pete.  Yeah.  Why would Pete...  I swear, dude, man.  I was there. 
[00:10:30]  What?  I saw him.  He was looking at the right front tire.  I asked him if the right front tire flew off.  Hold on a minute.  What side?  Huh?  What side?  Oh, what side?  Yeah.  Just say...  Dude.  Hold on.  Let's get him back.  Dude.  Lee, what side?  Passenger or driver?  Ty.  On the passenger side.  Yeah.  He was checking it down on the...  Oh, he was...  I'm telling you.  All right.  No, no, no.  Matt, you say it.  Matt's in the studio.  Matt, you know what?  The guy with the big black tractor trailer said, Bruno's on the side.  All right.  You definitely saw Pete checking out a tire.  Matt, he called from there.  He was looking at the tire. 
[00:11:00]  Hold on!  God, even a trailer...  Tell him around, 12.  All right.  Hang on.  God, he's annoying.  What a douchebag.  I have no voice today.  I can't scream at anyone.  So, please, be nice today.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Just for him.  Shut up!  Okay.  Use the recorded screen today.  Shut up!  I went to the doctor.  I have no voice.  Yeah.  My voice is shot.  Was it from that swallowing thing yesterday?  Oh, well, I'm talking about your...  Papa.  Oh, you're such an ass.  Papa, Papa. 
[00:11:30]  I can't fight back today.  Leave me alone.  Matt, so what was Pete doing with the tire?  He called and told me there's a nail in the passenger side tire, too.  But I don't think that's related to the front driver's side falling off on the way home today.  So, he had a nail in one wheel.  The lug nut's completely off the thing, it sounds like.  Oh, and a blowtorch in the back.  I forgot about that, too.  What do you mean a blowtorch?  Oh.  Freaking sabotage.  You're scaring me.  No, the nail is, uh...  I don't think it's related.  It's just...  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  So. 
[00:12:00]  Well, we'll get to the bottom of this.  We got a look at all the enemies that the NEW crew has had.  I believe, my personal opinion, is it was Black Earl the Sloth.  I believe he said, if I can't drive the van, no one's driving the van.  Of course, I'll be questioning the invisible man.  I'll keep an eye out for him. 
[00:12:30]  I only got one good one left.  I don't know.  I think we do need Columbo on this one.  Of course, there was an angry Nicky from We Deliver Keggers up in the studio.  Perhaps she went downstairs and with her screechy voice, loosened the lug nuts.  Although it could be Martin Landau or numerous radio personalities around this city. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Jack, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  In 1978, when I was 18, I was working in Paramus, New Jersey, over by the Stanley Water Theater.  Yeah.  And I was working as a mechanic in a shop.  And a car out on Route 4, heading west towards Patterson, an Oriental guy, had just got done changing his flat tire.  And what he did was he put the flat side of the lug nut to the wheel, not the tapered side. 
[00:13:30]  And the wheel came loose.  Yeah.  The wheel came flying off the car.  There were four bay doors in the garage.  Only one was open.  And the car was working on.  I turned around to get a tool out of my toolbox.  The tire clocked me square in the head.  Wow.  Almost killed me.  I mean, it was in the Bergen Record.  If you want to go back in the archives of the Bergen Record, there was a write-up on it and everything.  I mean, it was unbelievable.  The one door that, you know, had it hit one of the closed doors, it would have made some noise. 
[00:14:00]  And I would have turned around and got my attention.  Let me tell you something, man.  It busted all the teeth in my mouth.  My neck.  Oh, imagine just all of a sudden getting hit with a tire in the face.  Oh, no, no.  It didn't hit me in the face.  It hit me right on the top, on the top portion of my head, the front of my head, just above my forehead.  I was bald where the tire hit me, like it ripped the hair right out of my head where it skimmed off my head.  You've got a skid mark on your head.  Oh, dude.  It was unbelievable. 
[00:14:30]  A buddy of mine who, we just graduated Paramus High School, and my buddy Steve was coming down to meet me for lunch.  He comes to the shop, and this happened, I guess, about 10 o'clock in the morning.  He's looking for me.  The manager is looking around real nervously, like avoiding the guy.  They go out in the shop.  There's a pool of blood out in the shop.  All my broken teeth, because, like, when the tire hit me, it pushed my head down, and my teeth, like, broke.  They were like a jigsaw puzzle.  Oh, my God.  I closed my head.  I mean, I had raw nerves hanging out of, you know, my teeth. 
[00:15:00]  And my broken teeth were lying stuck in the dried blood on the floor.  It was real nasty.  And you want to know the kicker of it all?  My old man got this real a-hole lawyer, blew the whole case.  I wound up with, like, 15 grand.  That should have been set for life after that.  Do you have any pictures?  No, I don't have any.  I mean, it happened a long time ago.  Were you knocked out cold?  I was out for eight hours.  I woke up eight hours later in Hackensack Hospital. 
[00:15:30]  It's like a coma.  Oh, I mean, my friends were breaking my chops to call me Treadhead and all this nonsense.  Treadhead.  Well, that's what friends are good for, you know?  Yeah, but I'm telling you, man, that was some experience.  And, like I said, I got screwed, you know, big time with the lawsuit on it.  I only made, like, 15 grand, so.  Yeah.  And at 18 years old, you know that right through my wallet.  Wow, Jack.  That's a sick story, man.  That's an unlucky day.  Yes, it was.  I can't imagine having more of an unlucky day than that, getting hit by a tire when you're 
[00:16:00]  minding your own business.  Oh, man.  And, I mean, it was unbelievable.  And some guy stopped.  I had a witness for the whole thing and everything.  But still, you know, I lost out on the lawsuit part of it.  All right, Jack.  All right, guys.  I thought you'd enjoy that story.  Yeah, that's a sick one.  Yeah.  Okay, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Opie, I believe we have some audio from the parking garage, from the video cameras.  Yes.  Let's listen closely, see if maybe we can come up with something. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Who would have thought?  Scott, stop.  Dastardly, Scott.  Okay, coming.  Coming.  That's just effed up if someone did that, if someone did sabotage.  Someone did it.  I mean, someone had to do it.  Either someone sabotaged our van or the last time we got a service, someone forgot to, you  know, tighten the lug nuts.  I don't know.  But it's hard to believe that eight lug nuts would, you know, come off a car, Anthony. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Q, what's going on?  Opie and Anthony, how are you?  Q, you've got to make it fast.  Yeah, listen, I wanted to offer my services to some of these people that have been hassling  you, if you know what I'm talking about.  But, um, especially the situation, uh, you've got to make it fast.  All right.  I don't know.  It just, like, was babbling.  Uh, Veronica, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Doing well.  Um, I actually, I know someone who was, um, riding off a 280 and, um, an 18-wheeler's 
[00:17:30]  wheel came off, went over the divider and hit the, uh, driver and they died.  Oh, God damn.  Jeez, you're just driving along.  And all of a sudden, a big tractor trailer tire hits you.  Pretty bad, yeah.  Great.  I just thought I'd let you guys know.  That's insane.  Yeah, it's crazy.  All right, Veronica.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  All right, we've got a repair shop worker on the line.  If you're just tuning in, uh, our van, we're convinced, we're sabotaged. 
[00:18:00]  Uh, Pete and Stinky were coming back from South Beach Dance Club in Island Park.  They were on the Long Island Expressway going about 60, 65.  No problems there.  Yeah.  Then they got back into the city limits.  They're going about 10 or 15 miles an hour, you know, coming across town.  They said they had to make a couple of sharp turns.  Right.  And that's when it came off.  And the wheel comes flying off and they were going 10 or 15 miles an hour.  Hit the car in front of them. 
[00:18:30]  Um, and Pete, who's been working here for 35 years, is, like, just in shock somewhere.  I want somebody to bring the, uh, rotor back here when they, uh, replace it.  Because we have to look at the evidence, Opie.  See how worn the lug nuts, the lug bolts are.  And, uh, see, uh, how the rim was scraping on it.  We need the evidence.  Jeff, what's going on?  Guys, lug nuts do not work themselves off.  Yeah.  Okay, even if they're left loose, you'll know about it the first mile down the road.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  They don't come off by themselves.  Especially eight of them.  Eight.  Somebody sabotaged the van.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Let's confirm that with Derek here.  Derek, what's up?  He works for a tire company.  Derek.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  How's it going, O.D.?  Good.  Dude, totally sabotaged, man.  That just doesn't happen.  I mean, I deliver tires.  I've been doing it for years.  It doesn't happen.  No.  Never happen.  I hear you.  Well, someone's pretty sick out there. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Has someone checked downstairs where we park it for any sign of tampering, maybe a lug  nut that's laying on the floor or something?  Mark, you went downstairs?  You looked in the area?  I checked.  I checked under every vehicle down there.  There was no sign of any, like, more lug nuts lying around.  Any fresh ding marks from a lug wrench or something?  Nothing.  No fresh ding marks.  All right, Derek.  Thank you for that.  All right, man.  All right.  See you.  Yeah, I was being kind when I said that. 
[00:20:00]  Maybe they were just loose, but...  Hello.  I'm claiming responsibility.  Oh, boy.  Never a dull moment around here, huh?  Thank God they had luck on their side.  Daniel.  Hello?  Oh, Danielle.  What's up?  Hi.  Well, a couple months ago, my husband was in school in Newark.  He was driving down the road.  The back tire of his car flew off.  He rode down the road, hit another car.  Five drunk guys had to come and help him put it back on. 
[00:20:30]  Screwed up the whole car.  It turned out a bunch of kids from Newark were going around and doing it to all the cars.  Took the lug nuts off and just left and just took all the lug nuts.  Man.  So they just can't work themselves off.  Even the guy at the mechanic shop said they can't do it.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks.  Have a great day, O.  All right.  Now we got Bill, an auto mechanic, who says that lug nuts do come off.  Bill.  Yeah.  Hey.  About six months ago, on a pickup, I rotated the tires. 
[00:21:00]  Not even a mile from the shop.  The tire vibrated loose.  Although the guy was probably stoned, which he smokes a lot of pot.  Yeah, it vibrated loose, and it cost me $100 in towing.  And, yeah, they do come off.  The tire just came off.  Yep.  He did.  All the lug nuts just came off.  All the sex of them vibrated off.  The tire was off, and it was towed to a dealership in Little Falls.  And you couldn't tell?  No, I just, you know, got distracted by something else, and...  Something tells me if your tire is, like, ready to come off, like all the lugs are at the 
[00:21:30]  end of the nut, and, like, your tire's wobbling.  Kid Jimmy, he isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Something tells me you wouldn't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I'm a mechanic for 15 years, and it got by me, which I still get my chops broken about it.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We're very suspicious today.  Very.  Very suspicious.  Paul, you're next on WNAW.  Hello?  Let's go, Paul.  What's up? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, listen, I was driving on Route 112 back in 1980 in a rental, one of those yellow  rental vans, a box truck.  Yeah.  Okay?  And it was one of the ones that was not the big H company.  It was a smaller company.  Okay.  And I was being, I guess, attacked by the big H company.  So I'm driving along in this box rental truck, and it's got the double tires in the back.  Yeah.  And we got a full load on.  We're going from Baldwin to Port Jeff.  And as I'm driving, I see my two left rear tires past me in the median of 112. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay?  It jumps.  It goes down in the gully of 112.  Excuse me.  Yeah, watch that.  I said, holy cow.  Look at that over there.  And then the guy goes, you know, I know we only had one beer this morning before we loaded  up the truck, but don't you feel a little lopsided?  Oh.  So I'm going, I go, well, you feel like we're off-kilter or something?  And then he goes, well, let's pull over.  Let's take a look.  We pull over.  We have no tires in the left rear. 
[00:23:00]  Okay?  The tires that almost killed the people on the other side, now we can't even find them.  And we wind up sitting there for about eight hours waiting for them to come out and give  us another truck, which we had to unload the truck we had and put it into the new truck.  We finish about four o'clock in the morning.  Man.  Very lucky.  Yeah, very lucky.  You guys rule.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Syndication under where?  Yeah, exactly.  When we get a vehicle that works. 
[00:23:30]  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I'll tell you guys a story about my boss on Route 80 with his son in his brand new Lexus.  And they pulled up alongside a tractor trailer doing about 75 miles an hour.  And a bolt fell out of the truck, went through the windshield, and almost killed my boss.  Shattered his nose.  Had to get reconstructive surgery.  The doctor said he was lucky to be alive.  His nose got shattered by a lug nut.  Yeah.  Well, not a lug nut.  A bolt from the truck.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Hit the tire and got fired at him through the windshield.  Oh.  Went through the windshield with his brand new Lexus and shattered his nose. 
[00:24:00]  Reconstructive surgery.  Has a three-inch scar across his face from it.  Man.  All right.  You guys better be careful out there.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Oh.  A lot of people saying the lug nuts do come off, Anthony.  Yeah, well.  Most people saying no way.  It's got to be sabotage.  Yeah.  All right.  So.  Well, we'll try to get to the bottom of this.  I don't know.  I don't know how easy it'll be, but.  Well, I'm just glad that Stinky didn't die today on my birthday.  Yeah, that would suck.  That would suck.  And every birthday would be ruined because it would be the anniversary of Stinky's death. 
[00:24:30]  Right.  So I'm glad Stinky and Pete are okay.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  We've got to take a break here.  Stinky, you all right?  I'll be fine.  How's Pete doing?  Looks all right.  Looks all right?  Yeah.  Is he going to be able to clean the coffee cups today?  Someone wants us to check Earl's apartment for lug nuts.  All right.  It was the Ivan in the afternoon show.  Whatever that means.  Uh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And let's take a break.  What you want off that truck.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  We'll regroup.  I mean, you know, half you guys saying lug nuts do come off.  The other half saying no way.  They do not.  I think in this case, somebody was tampering with the wheel.  Yeah, because we just had the car.  Yeah, it's a newer vehicle and stuff.  I mean, really?  I mean, the odds are pretty slim that they would just fall off. 
[00:25:30]  But what an unlucky day that guy had.  The mechanic that got hit in the head with a tire.  Oh.  There's nothing worse than being blindsided by something that is completely unexpected.  And for that split second, you're like, what the f...  Right.  You know?  Why can't I be...  Like, bam, whoa, my buck.  And then you think of probability and odds and stuff.  And you're like, why can't I be, like, the lottery guy?  Yeah.  Where's that luck?  Where's...  Why can't I be lucky in that way?  No.  I gotta be the friggin' coyote from the Roadrunner cartoon. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  I gotta be the unlucky guy, you know?  Acme tire on my head.  That happens, like, once every...  I think that's the only time that's ever happened.  Why are you coyotes?  It says cars were invented.  Genius.  The guy sitting in his garage in a tire nails him in a...  Nails him in the head.  In the head.  Skid mark on his head, smashes his teeth.  Ow.  Oh.  You were lucky, Stinky.  One of the lucky troops of the O&A show.  Somebody trying a little sabotage. 
[00:26:30]  God, this is serious, though.  We gotta really try to find out what the hell the deal is there.  Oh, we'll figure it out.  Because I know there are some lunatics that work at certain places around this city.  Mm-hmm.  You know, that really wouldn't give two flying Fs.  Timmy, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, what's up?  How are you?  Happy birthday.  Hey, thanks.  Did you realize that today is the one-year anniversary that Owen Hart was killed?  Yeah, I know.  And you're over the edge of it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was driving back from Washington last year when that whole thing went down. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  Oh, man, Owen Hart died on my birthday.  Owen's been gone a year, huh?  Yeah.  I'm surprised that I didn't do anything last night on Raw to kind of commemorate it.  Yeah.  Nah, that's it.  They just kind of want to forget about that.  Move on.  Move on.  Yeah, well, happy birthday.  Hey, thank you.  Hope you get some good strippers.  Syndication when your wife is born.  All right.  Thank you, Timmy.  Timmy.  That was pretty good.  Syndication when your wife is born.  He remembers my line.  I said, my wife's not even born yet. 
[00:27:30]  God damn it, that's funny.  I love that line.  Dude, I got to admit, I wasn't going to come in today.  But we were that bad.  We have a short week and we got to, like, you know, promote our road show Thursday.  Yeah.  Yes.  I went to the doctor and I got some heavy antibiotics to get rid of this throat crap.  God, you and that throat.  Twice a year.  That's what, remember in November when it was the, remember when there was the Anthony and Rick show for about five days.  Oh, thank God.  Thank God you came in.  God is right.  Look, they both look at each other, thank God. 
[00:28:00]  The battle on the air that was the Anthony and Rick show.  How do you even hear it from me?  Mike, the toughest person to work with.  I couldn't be.  You.  I couldn't be.  Yeah, it's called, like, you know, throw me a bone and let me just help you out here.  And you're just like, I can't do this, myself.  Toughest person to work with.  I couldn't get three words out without Rick trying to coddle me through a friggin' live read or something.  Just trying to help out.  He's like, coddle me through a break like I've never spoken on a microphone in my life. 
[00:28:30]  He's like, no, I can do this myself.  I didn't say I can do it myself.  I said, let me do at least a portion of it by myself.  Like, try to get a sentence out without you stepping on me.  And this is why, ladies and gentlemen, I decided not to stay home today.  So I hope you appreciate it.  Yeah.  Because when I was sick in bed, I couldn't bear to listen to the Rick and Anthony show.  And the poor listeners that had to deal with it.  That's just a weird chemistry experiment when you two get together.  It was a whole bunch of things.  It was that. 
[00:29:00]  It was the old regime was still in place.  They had all kinds of restrictions on us.  So the second or two that we might have been having fun, that was cut short by management.  Yeah.  So it was a cluster F.  We did get one good thing out of that.  What's that?  Stephen Lynch.  Yeah, the song.  The cab song that he did.  Not without a 20-minute freaking battle.  Yeah.  Want me to get that?  All right, Ant.  We'll take a break and we'll be back, okay?  Yeah.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Other debauchery on the way.  Stay there. 
[00:29:30]  1027 WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Got to welcome a brand new sponsor to the O&A show.  Yes.  They started yesterday.  We're talking about Sobe beverages, the leader in healthy refreshment.  I've got to tell you guys, before they came aboard, I was drinking this stuff, man.  My gym has this.  Man, I've got to tell you, we drank some yesterday.  We drank the Energizer one yesterday.  Wow.  And wow, were we energized.  Totally.  I don't know what the hell this stuff is made of, but it's amazing. 
[00:30:00]  I got wood yesterday.  What?  Thanks.  What?  That stuff gives you wood.  I'm totally serious.  My God.  It's a little.  You should research the ingredients in the drink yesterday.  Well, today I'm trying out Liz Blizz, Echinacea, Zinc, and Vitamin C.  Maybe this is the one you should be drinking.  Oh, I'm all over it, Anthony.  What?  Rick.  What?  What do you do?  I don't know.  He's making up names.  Oh. 
[00:30:30]  Sobe beverages.  How's that, O?  That's excellent.  It really is.  The Lizard Blizzard?  The Liz Blizz?  It's a tropical brew that celebrates snowboarding and the lizards who carve the mountain.  Pretty cool.  Yeah, this stuff is great.  It tastes good.  And I tell you, I drank a bottle of the energy yesterday.  And my brain was racing.  And, man, that stuff gets you going. 
[00:31:00]  It was great.  I couldn't shut up.  Healthier than coffee.  And it got us going.  And today with the Lizard line, we're going to try some new flavors, Anthony.  Yeah, and it tastes good.  The Liz Blizz, I like it, with the echinacea, the zinc, and the vitamin C, Anthony.  Echinacea.  Sobe lizard under the cap saying stuff, right?  Yes.  Mine says, imagine all the lizards today.  Jeez, I need energy to get the cap open.  Peace, love, lizards.  There you go.  Let me try this, though.  All right, we're talking about Sobe beverages, the leader in healthy refreshment, Anthony. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, that's pretty good.  Check out the Sobe website, www.sobebev.com, for more info about Sobe and all of their different flavors, I should say.  Be on the lookout for the Sobe lizard love bus, spreading the Sobe experience all over the market, all over the tri-state area.  And so grab a Sobe and drain the lizard, okay?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Sobe beverages.  Hey, it's Joe Piscopo on 1027.  As the chairman of the board might say, Opie and Anthony, you are two groovy cats. 
[00:32:00]  I love you, baby.  You knock me out.  Wonderful, marvelous, beautiful, cuckoo.  Wonderful, marvelous.  1027-WNEW, it's O&A, 212-757-1027.  Anthony, the plot thickens.  Yeah.  You're just tuning in.  We just found out someone sabotaged our van today.  Someone could have gotten really hurt today.  Thank God the van was only going about 10 or 15 miles an hour when the wheel came flying and off. 
[00:32:30]  Very lucky.  Hitting the car in front of them.  Pete, who's been working here for 35 years, was shooken up, but he's okay.  We need to get him a stripper or something immediately to calm him down.  That always works for Pete.  And I love the girl.  And our own Stinky was in the van when it happened.  And now I'm finding out that they just checked the van.  It's getting fixed at an undisclosed location, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  There are lugs missing on the other tires.  Really?  Yes. 
[00:33:00]  Yes.  Matt or Mark, one of the guys just came down and told me that.  Ooh.  More lugs missing.  Who said that?  Can we get a report on exactly...  Where's the garage it's at?  Maybe we could talk to them.  That's not a bad idea.  If they're listening, give us a call.  We'd appreciate it.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, that is good.  Is Matt around?  One of the guys came in and told me that.  I don't know.  We're looking for him.  All right.  Yeah, we'd love to talk to the garage people.  Get the professional opinion. 
[00:33:30]  Other lugs are missing on the other wheels.  Yes.  That's great.  Someone looking to murder.  Someone trying to kill.  Somebody.  Kill one of us.  Somebody actually trying to commit murder on the people that work for this program.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What's up?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Trying to find out.  So does that mean you're not going to make that sticker stop today?  Well, you know...  You don't want to.  No, we still want to do the sticker stop.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, if we don't show up there, then whoever did this to us wins. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, but now everybody's expecting you to be on 22 today, and it looks like nobody's  going to show up now if the van's still not fixed.  Right.  Well, we've got to find out if we can still go there.  We'll bring the WOW stickers and a damn Pinto if we have to and hand them out.  Don't matter to me.  It's finally here in the neighborhood that I can actually make it to you, and I'm not  three hours away.  Right.  And now they're not going to be there.  I say we still do the sticker stop.  I don't care that we don't have the WOW van.  We'll bring another vehicle.  Well, there's going to be a lot of people showing up, so let's see if we can get a Pinto then. 
[00:34:30]  Get a lime green Pinto.  Does someone have a vehicle around here they could, you know, load up the trunk with some  WOW stickers and get to the sticker stop?  We can't let these people get to us.  Nope.  Mike, we're going to figure it out in a few minutes, okay?  All right.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  We should definitely still do the sticker stop.  Yeah, because now people will come out of the woodwork to support us over there.  Can we find out?  Because I think Lisa upstairs said she would drive her damn vehicle there with the stickers. 
[00:35:00]  Right?  Let's do it.  I say we do it.  Ben, try to find out.  I'm totally serious.  We can't let these people, you know, get the best of us, whoever sabotaged our van.  Paul the Pilot, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you?  All right.  How are you all doing?  Pretty good, man.  Now, let me explain who Paul the Pilot is.  Paul, of course, is the guy that wrote WOW above Central Park a few weeks back.  How are you?  Good.  Yeah?  Listen, I wanted to put on an air show for you guys on Thursday. 
[00:35:30]  Over our road show?  Yeah.  That would be huge.  Oh, my God.  It all depends on the weather.  And I need somebody to fax me a map and circle where you guys are to find out if it's legal or not.  We can do that.  Good, because I want to do it.  I figured I could get out there and put on a little show and boogie on home before it gets too dark.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  You know, the weather is supposed to be perfect Thursday for our road show.  Yeah.  Well, if it's not the weather, I just need to know where it is and make sure it's not in any of the TCA's for the major airports. 
[00:36:00]  Restricted zones there.  Yeah, restricted airspace.  But if not, you know, that's what I was planning on doing.  Wow, what's a couple of L-1011s trying to get into Kennedy?  Come on.  No, I don't think I'm going to mess with those big boys.  Well, it's in Island Park.  Yeah, I know, but I need somebody to, I don't know where that is.  Okay.  And if somebody could circle it on a map or something and fax it to me, then I can figure out and work on it tomorrow so I can set it up for Thursday.  Get that done immediately. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, I needed to talk to Rick.  Yeah, no problem.  We're going to put you on hold, Paul.  Okay.  We've wanted you to stop by the station, man.  Yeah, what happened last time?  You were going to stop by and then...  Well, I want to stop by.  I work for a family business selling swimming pools in Patterson.  Oh, yeah?  And it's hard for me to get out, but I definitely will make an appearance.  Okay.  You know?  Because you're a hero in our eyes.  Well, you need an Air Force.  You're going to have like 2,000 people at our road show Thursday.  If they see Wow in the Sky, the place will go ballistic.  Well, I don't know if I'm going to write Wow. 
[00:37:00]  I'll probably just put on an air show performance.  Oh, yeah.  You can do whatever you want.  You know, that's my specialty.  Writing signs is not really my, you know...  Yeah, then screw the sign.  We would love to see what you can do.  Oh, man, I want to see this guy tear it up.  Sure.  Oh, I'll tear it up.  All right.  I'll tear it up for sure.  You ain't ever seen anybody fly like I do.  All right, Paul, hold on the line.  Then we're going to definitely get you to Rick, okay?  All right.  There goes Paul, the pilot.  He's going to try to do an air show for our road show this coming Thursday.  The road show is shaping up to be quite an event, Anthony, this Thursday. 
[00:37:30]  I just hope I'm feeling up to par for this.  I'm looking at Island Park on a map right now.  Oh, yes, it looks clear to me, like I could tell.  Good.  Yeah, definitely fax in that info.  That would be great, man.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, we just look up, and this guy's tearing the skies up.  That would be great.  Very cool.  All right.  We should give out the details for Thursday once again, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Very exciting.  Every day, it sounds like it's getting bigger and bigger. 
[00:38:00]  We're going to be broadcasting live starting at 3 at the South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway,  Island Park, the directions are on the WNEW website, the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  You've got to be 21 or older, and there's no cover charge until 7 o'clock at night.  Get there early.  We've got so much stuff planned.  It's not even funny, including the Spaz Dunk Tank, the Wow Wet t-shirt contest.  So, ladies, when you get there, if you want in on that contest, you just have to find us  and sign up for that.  We've got cash prizes for that, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  We've got Otto and George.  We have Stephen Lynch coming down.  All the wackos that you know and love from this radio show will be there.  Well, most of them anyway.  And the highlight for me, Fuel and Q and your brother coming down to perform the most offensive  songs.  Yeah.  The most offensive song contest live.  Going to hear like four or six of the most offensive songs.  I think two each.  Yeah, at least six.  And if Stephen Lynch is brave enough to do FBA, then forget about it. 
[00:39:00]  It's going to be off the hook.  I don't know if we'll be hearing that one.  You never know.  Stranger things have happened, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, it's happening Thursday.  We want you guys to show up.  Get there early if you want to get in.  We can't wait.  The weather, believe it or not, is going to clear just in time on Thursday for this.  Yeah.  It's going to be a nice Thursday and Friday.  So, it's South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park, starting at three, doors open  at two, 21 or older with no cover charge whatsoever.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  We've got to figure out if we're going to do this sticker stop.  Rick, any info on that?  Not yet.  Not yet?  All right.  All right.  You want to take a break then, Anthony?  We really should.  You know?  Well, we just need someone to drive their car there with the WOW stickers.  Yeah.  Big Kev is willing to donate his ride.  He's on line 12.  Kevin doesn't have a job, man.  I'm convinced of it.  Kevin.  I do have a job.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  You're lying.  Why would I lie? 
[00:40:00]  Every time we need something, you're right there for us.  We appreciate that.  But then you start wondering, what does this guy do for a living?  Well, all I can tell you is if you ever need any legs broken.  Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Well, you know, I can't really discuss it.  But I will volunteer my ride.  I'll leave right now.  Well, we're just checking with the promotion department.  We don't want to put them in a bad situation.  Oh, Tony Bloomfield.  Tony Bloomfield?  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Very good. 
[00:40:30]  He was with Earl for the last few sticker stops.  Yeah, if they say it's a go, then we're going to do it.  We're just going to load a car up with the WOW stickers and show up at the sticker stop today.  I'm ready.  All I need is the word.  All right, man.  Hold on the line and someone will talk to you, all right?  Okay.  All right, man.  Why is Rob Halford calling me?  What?  Rob.  Hello.  This is Rob Halford of Judas Priest. 
[00:41:00]  This isn't Rob Halford.  This is Rob Halford of Judas Priest.  And I'm calling to wish you a...  It's Tim Broward.  You ass.  Hold on.  I got some drunken whore.  You ass.  I'm listening to me?  I'm listening to me?  I'm listening to me?  Shut up, whore.  I'm listening to me.  You stupid whore! 
[00:41:30]  It's my turn to be on radio.  What?  This is Scott Ross.  What?  Hey man!  What's up, bro?  How are you?  Hey, I did something horrible.  What'd you do?  I went out drinking last night.  I'm still up from last night, bro.  And we screwed around.  We saw this van.  Isn't that going to be really funny?  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  You took your nuts off, man.  It was Brewer, god damn it.  I knew it all along.  There's Rob Halford of Judas Priest.  Yeah, I need to hear another Rob Halford scream for me.  Oh, for my birthday.  Come on.  Hello, this is Rob Halford of Judas Priest.  I'll be...  sorry I must go suck on a bun. 
[00:42:30]  Happy birthday, Hammer.  Hey, thanks.  Your wife must be freaking out over there.  over there? No, I'm babysitting, man. Oh, really? Babysitting right now. I'm supposed to be quiet. Yeah, good job. I'm like in a dark corner of a closet. Hey, we got the word you're not going to be joining us Thursday. There's a slight possibility. I didn't know it was during the day. Yeah. Matter of fact, I just heard now that you were having three to seven. Yes. So I may be able to start it off. Yeah, you've got to come down. It is my daughter's first birthday. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, well, you've got to put your priorities in place and get your ass down to our parents.  How far out on the island is it? It's Island Park, man. We'll get you a car. We'll do whatever it takes. We want you there, man.  All right, then there's a good possibility then. Yeah, we'll get you transportation. I'm going to talk to Rick and see you. I'm going to wait until the wife's key comes. Oh, my parents come in that day, too.  You could do the first hour with us. We'll totally hook you up with transportation. 
[00:43:30]  Hold on a second. What did I say, whore?  Tell him!  Wow. Sorry.  Sorry. You're brutal.  Are you just beating yourself up over there?  No, I'm beating a whore.  Yes, of course.  I see no problem in what he's doing.  Exactly. You don't need to speak.  There's nothing wrong with slapping a woman around every show off.  So, cool. I'm going to try to make it, man.  Oh, you've got to do it.  I will let you know by the end of today. 
[00:44:00]  Hey, I've got to tell you, we were watching an old rerun of SNL?  Yeah.  Damn, man. I forgot how funny you were with Sylvester Stallone.  Oh, he was a cool guy.  The Mickey thing?  The Mickey thing?  I forgot all about that.  He's burning your rock.  Like a boom.  Like a dirty boom.  You get on there, you're a kiddie bastard.  And you kill him, you're all, you're all, you're all, like a boom.  And you can't, you can't sleep with a parrot. 
[00:44:30]  The chick who likes a parrot, you're going to hit that nigga.  Don't let the nigga beat you.  You beat him like a, like a boom.  You want the white folks to feel bad.  You got kids on Long Island knocking up to your neck.  Jesus Christ, knock that bastard out.  Yeah, this is fun, man.  He was a cool dude.  And the other thing, you're massaging his shoulders and stuff and he's breaking up.  God damn, was that funny.  Yo, he, uh, my dad, I introduced my dad to him.  My dad thought he had something in common with him because they both have a home in Florida. 
[00:45:00]  There you go.  My dad's like 75, you know.  Yeah.  And, um, he just, only if you could hang, like, he would hang with you guys.  But, like, fame, nothing, doesn't mean anything to him.  Really?  Yeah, like, he's, he's into the Elks and that's that, you know.  So, uh, Stallone's on the show and I go, Dad, dude, he's all excited.  Hey, uh, can I meet, uh, Sylvester Stallone there?  I go, yeah.  You want to go meet him?  So, we go up to him. 
[00:45:30]  I go, uh, Sylvester, I'm really sorry.  This is my dad.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  So, I, my dad goes up to him, World War II vet, you know, he's like, so, I hear you got a place down in Florida.  And Stallone's like, yeah, you know, I got a place down there, I don't really know that much, Mr. Brewer, but, you know, when I got him there, you know what I'm saying?  And then, my dad goes, um, yeah, I live in Tarpon Springs, where they got them sponge docks. 
[00:46:00]  And Stallone's just kind of looking at him.  Yeah, right.  And he goes, uh, I go to the Elks Club there.  They got an Elks Club where you live there?  Stallone goes, what?  Elks Club?  I don't know, I'm sure they got an Elks Club.  I mean, I don't know, I'm not really sure, Mr. Brewer.  And then, my dad goes, I swear to God, he goes, um, you know, it's a $1.50 beer there.  Where they rob you in your bullcrap joint, $1.50? 
[00:46:30]  You're going to be bankrupt for Jesus Christ.  You wouldn't catch me in that joint.  And he goes, boy, I should get that Chex pretzel mix.  They don't give you that at Planet Hollywood.  Jesus Christ.  I've got to bring my dad up there and tell you, you've got to have a field day.  Oh, please don't.  I'll give you guys a call later.  Oh, man, have a good birthday and you owe us a whistle ball game.  I was talking to my brother yesterday.  He's ready to take you on.  Yeah.  It's going to be embarrassing.  I'm going to videotape it and put it on the Internet. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, we're going to, yeah, anal-europe you.  Hey, we're going to, yeah, and I'm going to put it on Opie and all his brothers.  Hey, how's it feeling?  Jerry, you little Opie, you little mudget.  And I'm going to put two fingers in his pooper.  Take it out and anal-europe him again.  Yeah, I'll have his grandmother watch.  Jerry, you little horse.  Hey, precious.  Here we are, you. 
[00:47:30]  All right, all right.  All right, Rob Halford.  Thank you.  Be good, bro.  Happy birthday.  Hey, thanks, Jim.  Take it easy, bro.  Our buddy, our friend, Jim Brewer.  Now it looks like he might show up Thursday for the road show, Anthony.  That'll be cool.  New things being added every day.  Every single moment.  I cannot take when he does Norm.  Norm McDonald.  It's the funniest damn thing.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:48:00]  All right, so the road show Thursday.  Everyone's talking about it.  Yeah.  We just want to make sure a lot of you guys are there.  South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park.  Starts at 3.  Doors open at 2.  3?  2?  Doors open at 2.  That's all you need to know.  Doors open at 2.  2?  21 or older.  No cover charge, okay?  Bye.  And the weather is going to be beautiful.  Is that Don on the phone?  All right, we'll be back, Anthony. 
[00:48:30]  Yes.  What do you learn on the job?  I'm a functioning idiot without a high school department to get a job on the radio.  O.B. and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless.  7.  W.N.E.W.  Anthony Stacker 2.  Yes, world's strongest fat burner.  It works.  We've heard from plenty of people.  Lost weight with Stacker 2.  It burns the fat, builds lean muscle, gives you a boost to energy,  you feel it's effects within 45 minutes of taking it,  or they give you your money back,  and you won't be snacking during the day.  It cuts down on those cravings, 
[00:49:00]  so you won't get the hankering for the Twinkie that'll pack on the big ass.  If you want to be in our ugly ass competition,  stay away from Stacker 2.  We're definitely doing that this Thursday?  I would think, yeah.  Okay, we'll do the ugly ass competition.  Ugly ass contestants,  please do not get Stacker 2.  You want to keep that ugly, big, fat, dimply ass.  Stay away from Stacker 2.  You want to work that ass off?  Get Stacker 2.  Let me tell you something new about Stacker 2, too. 
[00:49:30]  Best two, the best TV commercials on TV.  God, that was funny during Raw last night.  Did you see that girl with the little tank top,  with everything just popping through, let's just say?  Yeah, very hot.  I was like, what the hell is going on?  How'd they get this on TV?  Stacker 2 knows.  They know what sells.  Just remember where Stacker 2 started, though.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[00:50:00]  Give them a call if you want to give it a try.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[00:50:30]  Our listeners have proven it works.  What happened to the girl?  I was going to go right to her right now.  Some girl wants to jump out of the airplane naked at a roadshow.  I can't do that.  Why not?  Is that illegal?  Something as illegal as that.  I don't know if it's illegal, but...  Hey, I'm going to talk to a girl that wants to skydive nude instead, 
[00:51:00]  because she hung up.  We've got to say hi to Jeff Norris.  Hey, Jeff.  How are you?  How we doing?  Thanks for the pizza and the beer, Gorilla Boy.  My trademark.  Hey, Gorilla Boy.  Yeah, that ain't Meisterbrow, Otto, if you're listening.  You little wooden.  Yeah.  You going to the roadshow Thursday?  Def, we're pumped, man.  Eddie Otto, we're pumped up.  Big Billy Hayes, Stephen Lynch, we're all carpooling.  Carpooling down to the roadshow.  Well, oh, I hate to put you on hold there, but we have a call on line 12, 
[00:51:30]  a long distance, I guess, for Opie on his little birthday.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Hey, happy birthday, you pig.  You miserable F.  What are you, 11?  Shut up.  Yeah, just about.  I'm in Puerto Rico.  I'm taking a vacation for you.  He's in Puerto Rico.  It's the least I could do.  You've decided to take a vacation?  That's right.  It's Louis Black, of course, our pal.  You staying in a compound there in Puerto Rico? 
[00:52:00]  I'm staying in, actually.  Actually, they're shipping me out to that island.  They're going to blow up.  We're bombing or something.  Yeah, this would be the mistake.  Oh, gee, we missed.  God, I thought it, you know, the kind of resort I stay at, it looks like that bar island.  Yeah.  Have you ventured out and said hello to the locals?  No, I literally just got here.  Oh, yeah?  And the first thing I wanted to do was really make sure that Opie was still alive.  Yeah, sure he did.  I can't picture you ever relaxing.  I know.  Like, on vacation. 
[00:52:30]  I can't picture you just relaxing on the beaches of Puerto Rico, taking a breath and going,  ah, this is nice.  Yeah.  We can't get past the fact that you're on vacation.  Yeah.  Lewis, are you there?  No, I'm working down here tomorrow night.  Oh, okay.  But I am taking six days off, but I am on the, but as soon as they put me on that bus  to come back to, to come from the airport to this place, and they start showing you the  video, immediately I'm like, what are they, what is this?  You know, I've already bought the ticket, schmuck. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, you're there.  It's not like they've got to sell you on the place.  You know, really, and then you can do this, and you can spend another $300 here, and come  down and have a wonderful meal here, and, you know, I think, come on.  Where else am I going to go, jackass?  We're 500 miles from anything here.  Lewis, why did you get so miserable?  Why?  Yeah.  I'm not miserable.  It's just like, well, what is it?  You're like, what, are you Mr. Happy? 
[00:53:30]  Well, you got me there.  At least when you start with the fact that you know it's going to suck, everything is  a bonus.  Right, you're not disappointed.  There's never a disappointment.  No.  The line actually moved quickly.  I mean, I'm standing on a line, there's six people on the line, and I'm already irate  that these people are too slow.  How nuts am I?  I mean, it's like...  What do you have planned for, like, six days in Puerto Rico?  I'm hoping a lot of Hummers.  Yeah?  Women down there? 
[00:54:00]  Well, you know, let's hope so.  Let's hope there's some sort of, you know, that they're stuck.  It's a compound.  There's only so many of us.  Yeah.  Man, Lewis, we could get you that right here in the good old United States of America.  What?  We could get you that.  No.  Yes.  He likes being outside of the continental United States.  Well, they can't get it on that little net thing you've got.  Yeah, the Internet.  Yeah, so that would be the day my mother, you know, logged on.  For the first time, right? 
[00:54:30]  For the first time ever.  See, it's Lewis with a girl giving him a whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever goes on in this studio.  Like what Greg Brady got the other day, the upside-down V.  Oh, we got something new for you, Lewis, when you come by.  Oh, this girl does like an upside-down split right in your face.  Oh, my God.  You sit in the chair.  She puts her hands on the floor and does a handstand in front of you and spreads them.  We have like a chin rest that's nice and soft.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:55:00]  Greg Brady thought it was unbelievable.  Yeah.  We had Barry Williams in, and boy, times have changed.  That's not an Olympic event?  No.  That should be.  Oh, man.  Definitely should be.  Synchronized stripping.  So, Lewis, I'm glad you're on the phone.  I've got to ask you about the whole Hillary-Rudy thing.  Total disappointment for me.  Yeah, we went on the air, and we were saying we're just really bummed.  We were looking forward to that race.  I was really looking forward to it because this Paul Lazio is kind of a sissy. 
[00:55:30]  What a little.  He's kind of a little.  He's got that little whiny thing going.  At least Rudy was like punching her around.  You know, this guy's like bitch slapping her.  He kind of came out swinging a little bit.  But not with that voice.  That little kind of whiny, you know.  And he's a Newt Gingrich Republican, for all he denies it.  If the man wants to get rid of the Department of Education, good job.  That's smart.  You know, the reason we have a Department of Education is you're sure that there'll be enough people in the room that maybe one of them can read. 
[00:56:00]  So are we aft with this choice or what?  Huh?  Are we aft?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Can't they find somebody?  We want to support Lazio.  Well, you know, go for it.  We can't go for Hillary.  We can't go for Hillary.  He's the lesser.  I don't want to hear him.  I'm ready.  Just somebody's got to come along.  I don't care who it is.  I'll vote for a dog.  Why don't we do that? 
[00:56:30]  We'll just run a dog against both of them.  Just a big barking dog.  A cute one.  That'll get the popular vote.  Exactly.  And one that you just teach it, you know, put a paw for yes and a paw for no.  Let's pick.  What difference does it make?  A beagle puppy.  Very nice.  See?  People love beagle puppies.  They do.  People love beagle puppies.  Instead of that damn Hillary with that speaking style she has.  I don't even know what that is.  Well, it's called somebody is, you know, basically transmitting her voice from another planet. 
[00:57:00]  And so that's the problem is the transmission.  Is that it?  It's over so many light years that...  Well, you know, the three of us who have absolutely...  Are not in touch with our emotions at all look like sensitive women compared to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's scary.  Yeah.  But they're both, really.  It's like, ugh.  It's like, you know, it's like you thought...  I can't remember the name of the other Republican, who, of course, they don't like because he  actually is a moderate. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  And I can't think of his name.  So they...  As soon as they actually...  As soon as the Republicans said they didn't want him to run, I thought, that's probably  the guy.  Oh, man, the one who probably speaks English well and is enjoyable to listen to.  Yeah.  And it's too bad, Rudy, boy, whoo, did he do a turnaround, huh?  Well, we were looking forward to a good mudslinging campaign.  Well, now he's even like, you know, now he's like Mr. Sensitive Man, which is exhausting  to watch.  Yeah, they had him kissing a puppy in the paper today.  I'll probably give him a... 
[00:58:00]  What?  Well, what were you going to say?  I was probably giving it a tongue.  Yeah, look at the new sensitive...  The new sensitive Rudy.  I mean, yeah, it's in the post today, Lewis, him kissing a puppy.  Oh, man.  Holding the puppy nice and close to his body there.  Oh, God.  What happened?  It's just sad.  Yeah.  And then you got...  And then the thing that really got me going recently is the fact that Bush was meeting 
[00:58:30]  with gay Republicans.  I'd like to know who they are.  Both of them.  I mean, really, what is that?  How much could you hate yourself?  Gay Republicans.  Gay and Republican.  Not even Jews hate themselves that much.  Oh, that's funny.  It would be like being a Jewish Nazi.  Yeah.  You know?  Gay Republican.  I mean, what is that?  And what is that?  What kind of a reach-out program is that?  I was going to say, he's trying to get, what, ten votes?  Well, talk about scary.  Yeah.  You know, boy, I'm gay, but I don't believe in gay marriage. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, how psychotic would you have to be?  You know, what...  Well, I don't believe in gay marriage.  I think promiscuity should just continue.  That's like a gay Catholic.  Oh, yeah.  Same thing.  Oh, man.  I think I should be killed.  Yeah.  Or a gay Baptist, which is probably the worst.  Or just being a Baptist, which is probably the worst.  The calls are pouring in.  Yeah.  All right, Lewis.  Well, we hope you have fun in Puerto Rico.  Yeah, have fun down there.  I'm sorry, man.  It's your thing.  Yeah, man. 
[00:59:30]  We wanted you to go to the roadshow, but obviously,  you're not going to be around for this one.  No, I know.  I would have done it.  I was doing this gig here, so...  Are you ever going to go to one of them?  Oh, of course I will.  We've only done about 15 of these.  Well, you've only asked me to go to two.  Okay.  The other 13, I was absolutely free,  and I wept each time.  All right.  All right.  You got us.  Hey, have a good birthday.  What are you going to do, Hope?  I'm staying in the city.  I'm under the weather, actually, today.  It's a drag to be sitting.  I can't imagine why.  It's like 42 degrees every day. 
[01:00:00]  I know.  Great.  It sucks to be sick on your birthday.  That just blows.  Yeah, but you can always make it.  Then you can have a birthday week the week after.  Yeah, no.  We have a great week ahead of us here,  so I'm pretty psyched.  I'll have fun today.  Well, good.  Have a good time.  Hey, thank you, man.  My pleasure.  Take care of yourselves, guys.  All right, Lewis.  Later.  Have fun.  Lewis Black, live from Puerto Rico, Anthony.  There he goes.  Very nice.  Let's go back to the phones.  If you've got something,  212-757-1027.  Keith, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  How are you? 
[01:00:30]  Happy birthday, Opie.  Hey, thanks.  Listen, I wanted to talk about this before.  Hillary Clinton, I just found out she was speaking on the commencement.  Where?  At Farsall High School.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I mean, there's a lot of talk about it.  Everybody thinks that it's not true,  but I talked to a lot of people who are trustworthy,  and they said, yeah, it's true.  And that's our Coliseum.  Wow.  Yeah, so I figured maybe you guys come down or something.  I'm trying to figure out what we can do.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  We don't want to, you know, go to Hillary.  Yeah, the Secret Service.  So, you know, what we're all thinking of is that we have the,  you know, the beach balls going up,  have Secret Service come attack us.  Well, you don't want Secret Service.  No, absolutely not.  Ever, ever, ever.  Please, don't get yourself in trouble with the Secret Service.  Yeah, let us know how it goes, all right, Keith?  Definitely.  All right, man.  Take care, guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  All right.  So, yeah, Jeff Norris in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  He'll be down there Thursday.  I'm psyched. 
[01:01:30]  We're all looking forward to it, man.  It's going to be a debauchery at its best.  George is getting a paint job as we speak.  Oh, really?  Ready for the show.  Yeah, Otto and George are going to be down there.  Otto and George the Puppet, of course.  You'll hear I'm unedited.  It's going to be scary.  We're all carpooling.  Me, Otto, Billy Hayes, Stephen Lynch.  Billy Hayes is Jay Moore's guy.  And Jay's driving.  Jay's going to attempt to call or something from Vancouver.  I can't confirm.  I've got to check with the...  How are we going to work that out, though? 
[01:02:00]  Billy Hayes was at the show in Pips and Sheep said, baby, this past weekend.  And we were talking about it.  And he says, yeah, he says, Jay says, he sends his regards.  He's going to try to do something.  He's actually pissed that he can't be there because he wants to be there.  But he's filming a movie with Bill Murray or something, they're saying.  We could probably work it out if we got, like, headphones and stuff.  We're going to be doing a live broadcast.  AT&T operator?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  Phone a friend.  Yeah.  Well, this is shaping up to be a great road show this Thursday, man.  It's going to be awesome.  Otto and George, Jeff Norris, Stephen Lynch, hopefully doing FBA. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  He's got to do it one time.  Yeah.  There's a rumor he did it at one of his comedy shows.  He did.  Rascals.  Oh, then he's got to do it.  The crowd won't let him.  Sorry, Steve.  I'm ready.  Oh, then he's got to do it.  Look at that Rascals in West Orange.  The crowd won't let him get away with it.  And then we've got the other guys from the other songs that came in for the most expensive song.  Yeah, I heard that yesterday.  That's going to be wild.  They're coming down to do them live.  I can't wait to hear Imagine live.  What's up, Rick?  Done.  We're kicking Jeff out of here. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, really?  He's decided.  We've gotten the okay.  We're going to do the sticker stop.  Yeah.  Jeff Norris is going to be your host.  All right.  All right.  This is cool, because if you're just tuning in, our wow van, we're convinced we're sabotaged.  A victim of sabotaging.  People could have got really hurt today or even died.  A wheel went flying off our wow van.  Eight lug nuts missing from the wow van.  Oh, boy.  At least eight.  Well, yeah, no one can confirm it, but someone did tell me in the hallways that there's more 
[01:03:30]  lug nuts missing on the vehicle.  That just happened.  So the wow van is getting fixed, and that meant that we couldn't do our wow sticker stop today.  And we're like, you know, don't let the bastards get us down.  Screw that.  So, Jeff, you were going to go down there?  Yeah, I'm going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  All right.  Jeff is going to drive his car down.  I need the Dodge Ram.  Look for it.  I need the address and everything.  Give me the address to the sticker stop.  Whoa, here comes Pete.  Here's Pete.  Ah, here he is. 
[01:04:00]  Here's Pete.  Oh, my God.  He was driving the van when the wheels flew off.  Pete, you get a purple heart.  Pete, how long have you been working here?  A long time.  Over 30 years?  Sounds like it.  Over 40 years.  Over 40 years?  Over 41 years.  Oh, my God.  Has anything like this ever happened to you?  Besides the time you rolled the car?  Well, so what happened today, Pete?  Pete, just minding his own business.  He's been there 41 years. 
[01:04:30]  Just trying to make sure that we're going to have a good broadcast this Thursday when we  do our road show.  Look, I'm devoted to the show, but I didn't think I was going to have to give up my life  to do this.  I know.  Close.  I would have been the first fatality of the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, well, that would have been a ratings grabber.  You've got to admit.  So you're coming back from Island Park in the wild van, right?  Well, it's just lucky that we weren't on the Long Island Expressway or the Queens-Mittal  Tunnel.  Yeah.  Right, right.  Oh, the tunnel.  I would have been pissed if I was behind you.  Yeah, we would have lost a lot of listeners if you were the reason why the tunnel was 
[01:05:00]  backed up today.  Big Opie and Anthony on the side of the van plugging up one of the tubes.  People just pissed.  I hate you.  That would have sucked.  Yeah.  So the LIE and all that was completely fine.  The tunnel was fine.  You get back into Manhattan.  It was just lucky.  As I was going across town, we hit like a small pothole, and all of a sudden I saw the  wheel fly off, and I heard like a grinding sound.  Oh, boy.  But I was only doing 10 miles an hour.  Which is lucky, officer.  Did the tire hit anyone? 
[01:05:30]  No.  Oh, I heard it hit the car in front of you.  That's not true?  No, it hit the car.  Part car.  Oh, part car.  Okay.  It just rolled on it.  Not really any damage.  Oh, my God.  Were you freaked out, Pete?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Can we get you a stripper?  No.  No?  It's not good for my heart.  I'll take one.  Did you see Floyd the barber or what?  Yeah, you are.  You're Floyd the barber.  Now, Floyd.  You know what?  What happened?  The lugs came from the other tires to get the wheel back on.  Um, so the guys can get the jack underneath it. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, is that what they did?  All right.  It's a couple for me.  So, it was just that one tire.  I had them all started.  All right.  So, okay.  All right.  Man.  It was sabotaged.  So, Pete, you think it was sabotaged?  I think somebody might have loosened them.  Because there's eight lugs on there.  There's no way that they all could be loosened.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Poor Pete.  He's been working here for 41 years, man.  41 years.  Remembers when Scotzo was a...  He was a young kid.  Yeah, well, probably not a young kid. 
[01:06:30]  All right, Pete.  Well, we're glad you're all right.  All right.  Yeah.  There he goes, Pete.  The engineer.  Yeah.  Of WNEW for 41 years.  Wow.  Nice.  And it looks like he'll have a few more years left in him.  Happy birthday, Opie.  I killed myself for you.  Yeah.  Don't die on my birthday, man.  Yeah.  That would be terrible.  That would just suck.  All right.  So, Jeff Norris will be doing the WOW sticker stop today, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're going to Game Stop. 
[01:07:00]  Right?  Yes.  All right.  And it's located on Route 22 East in Union, New Jersey, across from Coconut's Music.  Yeah.  No, the WOW van will not be there.  Jeff Norris and his lovely...  Big blue Dodge Ram.  And his big blue Dodge Ram.  Oh, I've been in that damn thing.  Yeah.  That's a walker ranger.  Yeah.  Check my uncle's truck.  We can load up a lot of WOW stickers on there.  Yeah.  It's so fun, man.  Come down.  All right.  So, what is it called officially?  Babbage's Game Stop?  Babbage's Game Stop.  Yep. 
[01:07:30]  Located on Route 22 East in Union, New Jersey, across from Coconut's Music.  Jeff Norris is leaving here now.  He'll be there within the hour, right?  Absolutely.  He'll be there by 5.30, let's say.  Absolutely.  Please support WOW and WNEW.  We had a real rough day today with the WOW van.  Battle.  Well, and we want to have a nice turnout at this sticker stop.  And Big Kevin's going to be helping them out, too.  Yeah, Big Kevin will be there, too.  That's right.  Big Kevin.  All right.  Very cool.  We'll take a break, and we'll be back.  Hello.  Yeah, I thought I'd object a little intelligence to this conversation here. 
[01:08:00]  That has no place on this show.  I know that.  Okay.  And Anthony.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  WNEW.  Anthony, Ranch One Restaurants, the makers of the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth.  Mm-hmm.  I got into work late today.  Yeah.  At the doctor, getting some antibiotics, so I couldn't join you guys for the fine Ranch One  food today, Anthony.  Oh, they bring a bunch of Ranch One in there, don't they?  Every week, they load us up.  Everything.  They get the grilled chicken sandwiches, grilled chicken fajitas, burritos, chicken salads, 
[01:08:30]  and pastas.  And their newest creation, the grilled chicken parmesan.  Something for everyone at Ranch One.  Yeah, they're great.  They put them in the tortilla with the fresh peppers and stuff.  Everything fresh.  Tastes really good.  So get your ass down at Ranch One.  Pick something up.  It's not like going to a fast food place and getting some greasy burger or something like  that.  A little healthy.  Yeah.  And it tastes very good. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I enjoyed the stuff I've tried so far, Anthony.  Yeah.  Also, they're helping us out with the WOW campaign.  You can get your Whipping Mount Wednesday stickers at all Ranch...  Well, not at all Ranch One locations.  We should say participating Ranch One locations because some of them aren't participating.  No.  So you can go in there now if you like and get, you know, one of the WOW stickers, okay?  Yeah.  Ranch One, the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth.  Try it today.  You'll love it.  Hi, this is Otto.  This is George of Otto and George.  And you're listening to O&A on NEW. 
[01:09:30]  Suck, nice, ****, you losers.  Thank you, George.  We love George.  Otto and George will be at the Roadshow Thursday.  Yeah.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Hey, Tony, what's going on?  Yeah, I'm down at South Beach Dance Club right now.  The sign out front says Thursday.  Opie and Ant-Noise.  Ant-Noise?  I think they can even spell Anthony right?  How do they spell Anthony? 
[01:10:00]  Uh, A-N-T-H-N-O-Y, the N's backwards, the, everything else can't be backwards, can it?  Yeah.  What?  You think it would say Opie and Ant-Noise?  No, it's just Opie and Ant-Noise.  Are you going to be the first person online for the Roadshow?  Oh, I live in Island Park.  Oh, okay.  I'm just kidding.  Go ahead.  You know, and if you can't get girls there, you've got Hooters a half a block away.  Very nice.  You know?  We're looking forward to Thursday. 
[01:10:30]  But you're going to have your Roadshow at this, like, very, like, powdery pink and green building.  Oh, yeah, whatever works, man.  We don't care.  We don't care what it looks like.  We're going to have a party.  Very pretty.  But anyway...  We'll have it at a truck stop if we have to.  I don't give a crap.  As long as we get our listeners together, we have some beer and have some fun.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  My guys want to take off from work?  We're roofers.  We work during the day.  No, I have to take off on Thursday because they're coming down here.  Roofing.  I'll find you.  I heard what you said about roofing. 
[01:11:00]  I don't want to hear it.  All right, man.  All right, Tony.  It takes a lot.  Okay, Tony.  But we'll be down here Thursday.  All right.  I'm on line now.  All right, good.  Thank you, Tony.  All right, bye-bye.  I don't know the point of that phone call, but...  Jesus.  Old Dirty!  What?  Look, Old Dirty, but returning to the program for a phone call?  What happened, sir?  Returning to the program for a phone call, are you?  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  What's he stoned?  Old Dirty.  Yo.  You've been on hiatus for a while. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, B.  How's life?  It's all right, man.  Shaping it up, kid.  Yeah?  Yeah, yo.  What are you doing?  Give us an update.  Yeah.  Have you gotten a job yet?  Yeah, yo.  I got a job with a major telecommunications company.  When did you get that?  What's up?  Yo.  I passed.  You already had, like, two tests?  Yeah.  I took both of them and aced them, son.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What up, man?  Get out of here.  When did you get that job?  I just went yesterday to fill out the application. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, and you didn't get the job yet, son?  Well, yeah, man.  I'm in, like, flame, my brother.  How long have you been unemployed?  Yo.  I got out.  When I got out, after doing my little bed, let me see.  That's October 15th.  So we're looking like at 7 March, my man.  Oh, man.  Y'all on unemployment?  Yo, it ran out, kid, like a week ago.  Man, I thought you got a job.  That blows.  That always sucked with the unemployment right after. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, right?  Oh, man.  You swear you're going to get the next check, bro?  You're looking in the mailbox?  Yo, you're like, wait a minute.  Where's my government check?  Where's the loop, kid?  I work for a telecommunications company, B.  I sell cell phones that I acquire from a second party down the road.  You realize you're going to have to show up at work?  What's up?  Man, we should hire you here.  Yo, what's up, man?  Yeah.  Oh, what are you insane?  Yo, Opie and Anthony never hooked you up, not even cleaning the toilet, my man. 
[01:13:00]  Are you crazy?  Well, Earl's no longer alive.  Yo, what's up, man?  So, I mean, we should hire you, man.  Well, I got a clean license and everything, and I know my way throughout the tri-state area, B.  Yeah, Earl didn't realize how good he had it.  Yeah, but what happened with Earl, man?  What happened with the brother, man?  We're kind of upset out here, you know what I'm saying?  We don't even care at this point.  We don't even care.  Don't even want to discuss it.  All right, man.  He said he was going to quit.  I'm hoping he did.  We haven't seen him since the confrontation. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, so he was going to quit the station in its entirety, like just be out?  That's it?  Yeah, he got all brave last Friday.  He said he wanted to talk to Jerry.  I heard that.  A.K.A. Pip, and say that, you know, I'm out of here.  Who, Pip?  Pip and Law and Stocking?  No, Pip from South Park.  The English kid, our boss is from England originally.  Even though he speaks perfect English and stuff, but he started his life in England,  and he came to America as the only kid in his class that had the wacky English accent,  just like Pip from South Park. 
[01:14:00]  So you know he was getting, like, pummeled.  Yeah.  Every once in a while, a word will slip out, though.  The other day he was talking about tirades, and he goes, and that person had a tirade.  A tirade.  A tirade.  Yeah, you got to look out with your brothers from the motherland, right?  Yeah.  So I don't know.  Earl was all brave and stuff Friday saying, you know, screaming and yelling at us,  saying, I want to talk to Jeremy.  I want out.  But he's still walking the hallway, so I don't know.  What's he doing now?  Because the only thing he did do was involving things with this show. 
[01:14:30]  You know what I mean?  He was involved with things.  Yeah, well.  And now he's trashing us on other radio shows.  What?  Like that?  That's what I hear.  Yeah.  He flipped in less than a week, my man?  Bye-bye.  Ah, come on, brother.  That's easy to dismiss, man.  You don't want to talk about it, I don't want to talk about it.  No, we don't.  The listeners are sick of the whole Earl thing anyway.  You know what I'm saying?  So, why don't you give everybody an update on what you're doing?  You might have a job.  Yeah, you know, I might be working at any W, kid. 
[01:15:00]  No, I wouldn't start writing any checks on that income.  Yeah, what's up with Jeremy, man?  That's my man, though.  Hey, what telecommunications company?  Because I got some money held up in some of those stocks.  I want to make sure you're not going to mess up my little nest egg.  With my interest into their workforce, it's just going up.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  Stockbroker Dave might not be coming in today, as a matter of fact.  Well, they took a little hit today, right? 
[01:15:30]  Stockbroker Dave's coming in to play, win Stockbroker Dave's money.  Matter of fact, I forgot about that.  Ladies, Dave will be here in a half hour.  The theme of winning his money today is fruits and vegetables.  Fruits and vegetables.  Man.  Hey, old Derry, did you hear the last time we did win Stockbroker Dave's money with the  wiffle ball back?  Yes.  Tries to win Stockbroker Dave's money.  And Stockbroker Dave gave out over $400 as one, well, I guess you were. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, I heard about that.  I guess she was a lady.  I wanted to get a hold of her pimp's number, though, you know what I'm saying?  So I set up a little meeting with this young lady and check out her swallowing technique  for myself.  Oh, please.  It wasn't swallowing.  It wasn't swallowing.  Yeah, I know that, my man.  O.D., what are you doing tomorrow, or Thursday?  You coming down to the...  Yo, I'm coming down, B.  Yo, as a matter of fact, man, you think if I start walking down to L.I.E.  I could get there in time for Thursday?  No, they don't pick up your kind on the L.I.E.  Oh!  Yo, people, I don't think it's going to be like that on your birthday, dude. 
[01:16:30]  What's he got to do that for, O.D.?  It's the antibiotics.  Are you sick again, man?  I got the throat happening.  See, y'all, Anthony, that's a couple of times already with this kid in his throat, right?  B.A.?  Yeah, man, what you doing on the side, O.P.?  I want the tonsils removed, man.  Yo, it's like that?  Oh, God, it sucks.  O.P., you're a little bit of Bacardi with honey, kid.  Yeah?  Yeah, on the real.  No doubt.  No doubt.  Hey, old Dirty, we missed you, man.  Yeah, I missed...  You're still listening to the show and stuff?  My man, I'm...  Yo, I... 
[01:17:00]  I...  I switched places, you know what I'm saying?  I went from being, like, not really an integral part of the machinery, you know what I'm saying?  I took the steps back because I had to check myself, you know?  Yeah.  I wasn't, like, you know, I wasn't on my floor the way I was with my snappy little jolts,  whatever this and that, you know, how few and unfrequent they were.  You know what I'm saying?  I had to step back and, you know, take care of me.  But now, yo, it's all good, kid.  Cool.  It's connected, man. 
[01:17:30]  Me and James Earl Joe's going to be chilling, son.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that goes to indirect, right?  I just blew up the spot.  Hey, old Dirty.  What's up, baby?  Getting any girls pregnant lately?  Yo, on the real.  Yo, last week, this girl came out to me.  She was like, yo, I might be seeing you bugging.  But then it was all good because, yo, I got this J.R.B.  I would have been able to take care of that one way or the other, you know what I'm saying?  Wait, what?  I missed something somewhere.  He gets the job, so he would have been able to take care of that one way or the other.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  You know, either raise the kid or have the abortion.  Let's not even talk about that.  Wow, so you almost knocked up another lady.  Yeah, B.  How many would that make?  That'd be like four, man.  Oh, man.  You are disgusting.  Come on, man.  Come on.  Throwing that seed around like that, the old Dirty seed.  Yeah, B.  He's got the apple seed season, bro.  Got to have a seed for the year 2000.  You know how good that is?  There might be a little bit of good luck, too.  Old Dirty, why do you guys want to just knock up women? 
[01:18:30]  I need to know.  You know it's happening in your neighborhood.  Man, it's happening in every neighborhood.  It doesn't happen in my neighborhood.  Yo, come on.  You're going to tell me them little white boys, little white girls, before their parents come home at 6 o'clock.  Don't go stop downstairs in the basement.  Smoke a little doobie and then go upstairs and frolic.  Oh, they're having the sex, but for some reason, they're not knocking up the bitches.  Yeah, I don't know, man.  Maybe we ain't getting those ad campaigns that y'all be getting on Channel 12 out there on the island. 
[01:19:00]  Where the hell are you?  Me, I'm outside my window, man.  It's been kind of hot out here, too, B.  It's a race thing.  What happened?  It's a race thing.  Yeah, they're not giving us the stop smoking campaigns.  Nah, we're just building all the liquor stores in your neighborhood.  Yeah, that's right, man.  Not handing out the condoms.  There you go.  Keep you people drunken and effing.  That's right, man.  Keep them high, keep them flying, right?  Oh, my.  You just blew up the conspiracy right there.  The conspiracy.  Hey, Old Dirty, Nick, on line three, NASDAQ just dropped because of Old Dirty. 
[01:19:30]  Nah, you don't care.  Down 200 points.  You're scaring everybody.  We need to know which telecommunications company you're working for.  Nah, kid, yo, I kind of blew it up before.  I'm not going to say it again.  Yo, what happened with the van, dude?  Someone took the lug nuts.  All right, you're the perfect person to ask.  You're working up, man.  You ask me, B.  Is it sabotage when eight lug nuts are missing from a tire?  Sabotage?  I think somebody's trying to pull your heads out, kid. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Somebody's trying to put your brothers out the side of the road.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, we almost lost Pete.  He's been here for like 41 years.  Yeah, that quiet kid with the glasses in front of all the amps.  See, yo, every time I used to go to the studio, Pete used to be like by that, you know that  room with all the electronics you got?  Yeah.  The one I'm so impressed with?  Yeah, yeah.  That you want to piece up?  Every time I'd be floating over there by the room, Pete's like sneaking around behind me  to swear I'm going to take an amp or something, yo.  Oh, you notice when the white guy follows you? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, B.  I've been to all the major department stores.  I know how to lose them, but, you know, it's because it's been a while.  But, yo, man, I could steal your van.  I don't know how to fix it, but, yo, from my understanding, eight lug nuts ain't just  going to fall off like that, my man.  Right.  Sabotage.  Yeah, boy, that's some Bugs Bunny sabotage.  Right.  Get the Acme Ranch type business, yo.  Well, we almost lost Stinky, yo.  Yo, Stinky.  Yo, he's still smelling, right?  I heard he stood online for some tickets or something like that, right? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, he smells like fish, and coincidentally, he's going to fish tonight, so.  He smells like fish?  Yeah, he was up all night getting his tics.  No lie, man.  He came in humming yesterday.  No, he came in humming.  Came in humming.  Yo, what's up with Kevin, yo?  You still being on his go?  Y'all had a dream with this chick, too, son.  What do you mean?  Yeah, B.  You were dreaming about Stinky? 
[01:21:30]  Oh, what?  I was putting a little coffee in that milk, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, man.  Get Spaz in there.  He's going to flip.  You got to say, tell us about the dream, man.  Yeah.  Wait till I get thin.  Wait, we got to get Spaz in.  Spaz, old Dirty, he's back on the show.  Yeah.  We missed you, old Dirty.  See, when you don't try to force it, you're pretty good on the radio.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what I'm talking about.  The flow got to flow like the oil slick coming out of Exxon Valdez.  You can't force these things.  So now, Spaz is here. 
[01:22:00]  Why don't you tell them what happened?  Yo, Kevin.  Yeah?  Yo, pardon me, B.  I had a dream with Erica, son.  What?  I tore it up.  Where was I in the stream?  I'm sorry.  Where was I in the stream?  Yeah, where was the Spaz, Meister?  The Spaz?  It wasn't like he was watching or anything.  He wasn't even in the equation, my brother.  Tell us, give us some details.  Wow, we made a porno, me and Erica.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, nine months later, she had two carriages. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, man.  So, in this dream, you fouled Spaz's girl.  I didn't foul her.  I treated her like a lady.  You ever see how the ladies get treated on the pornos?  Even better than that.  Yeah, even better than the pornos.  You were pulling some of those porno moves.  What?  You're like, we love it in the hood, kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are like, what?  We be watching pornos sometimes, me and the fellas,  and me like, yo, that's my next jammy right there.  Yo, Kevin, man. 
[01:23:00]  I'm like, yo, relax, bro.  I've been up by Sloatsburg.  You know what I'm saying?  You up there with, man, they got bears and stuff out there, right?  Yeah, they do, actually.  This is bear season.  Yo, word?  Yeah.  Yo, what's up, man?  Why don't you hook me up with a couple of bad-skinned rugs?  Yo, maybe we could go up there and kill them ourselves, bro.  I think if I go up to Sloatsburg with Kevin,  I might come back in a body bag.  All right, this just in, old Dirty.  What's up?  Yo, guys, I just sold all of my Bell Atlantic stock.  Sell, sell, sell. 
[01:23:30]  Don't do it.  Old D said the job is in the telecommunications business.  Is that stealing cell phones from people on the street  and selling two for $50?  Two for $30, two for $30.  Nah, I'm the real, nah, man.  I ain't stealing or robbing phones or nothing like that.  Of course not.  I'm the funky technician.  Yeah.  That's it.  Of course.  Yeah, I heard, yo, I don't know if you're going to get it.  I can't get into it, man.  So, yo, yeah, man, I'm going to be a technician, man. 
[01:24:00]  Messing with the wires and stuff like that.  I'm good with that.  You know?  All right.  Old Dirty.  What's the week's name?  Nah, he's just doing some stuff.  Oh, well?  My brother liked Erica, too, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, V.  He thought Erica was cute.  You and your twin brother?  Yeah, yo.  That is so funny.  Old Dirty's got a twin brother that is nothing like Old Dirty.  Yeah.  You guys are like complete opposites.  Look exactly alike.  Yeah, V.  Steve wants to know if O.D.'s dream was in gonzo vision. 
[01:24:30]  Yes, it was in the gonzo style.  Pure amateurism, yo.  I love the gonzo style.  Hey, O.D., what's the word on the street as far as the Knicks go?  My man, yo, they got the audacity, man.  I mean, Joe, you know, and Tim Hardaway, you know what I'm saying?  Tim Hardaway has been in the league 10, 12 years.  Going to turn around and say that Latrell wasn't calling time out.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, I think Latrell even admitted he wasn't calling time out. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my.  He didn't call time out.  Well, this guy did.  Charles did.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And Houston.  Screw Miami.  We beat them again.  Exactly.  I'm talking about, like, the Pacers and Reggie.  What's the word on the street?  Yo, the word on the street is, man, we're looking at the series to go the whole full.  To go the full seven games.  We feel that if Reggie Miller is going to have another one of his 40-point bombs, like  it did to the Sixers. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And Ewan doesn't step up.  And Houston going to be on that bum leg.  And Canby, non-existent.  I love Canby, you know what I'm saying?  Coming out of Boston, he was like the bomb.  You know?  Yeah.  Come on, man.  They got to step up, man.  Because, yo, the Pacers, they're number one seed, man.  And they proved it.  Yes, they did.  You know what I'm saying?  And Reggie Miller is quoted in the paper saying he hates New York.  Yeah, we hate him, too, man.  That big-eared bastard.  That big-eared bastard. 
[01:26:00]  Yo.  That's good.  I think Tyson will have a full-course meal with him, man.  We just need Jeff Van Gundy to, you know, stay together.  Yo, what?  What's the word?  Jeff Van Gundy got a 95 Civic, yo.  Yeah, he does.  Almost murdered himself on a highway, man.  He's got a 95 Honda Civic that flipped at that airport.  Yeah, but what about Malik Sealy, kid?  Yeah, that was a bummer.  That's a bummer.  Yo, I heard he was driving a Range Rover, man.  That's a $70,000 truck.  You think he could survive a little, you know, little head-on collision or something? 
[01:26:30]  At least being a quarterback, hey, week.  Little Asian guy, drunk.  What?  Took him out, yeah.  Yeah, well, you know, the guy should have been wearing.  His goddamn seatbelt.  Word up.  But look at the irony there, yo.  Look at the irony right there.  Like, you got the chinks, you know what I'm saying?  The little delivery man and everything.  And then my brother's like chicken wings and hot sauce.  Yo, that's irony right there, bro.  That's some tight, you know? 
[01:27:00]  They both weren't wearing their seatbelts.  But the Asian guy that hit him had an airbag in his vehicle.  The Range Rover don't have an airbag?  No, he didn't have an airbag.  And no seatbelt or nothing.  He just...  Well, here was this truck.  He got, like, massive head and chest injuries.  Man.  Gotta wear them seatbelts, man.  Yo, weren't you loving Malik Sealy going to St. John's, yo?  Yeah.  I thought he was going to be major force, man.  Without a doubt.  Well, he was doing great for the Timberwolves.  He was, man.  Hey, Old Dirty, someone is on the line saying that you called their house as a telemarketer. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, put on, man.  Are you a telemarketer now?  Nah, I don't like telemarketing or anything like that, man.  That's corny.  Adam.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey, you're on with Old Dirty.  Happy birthday, Precious.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, yeah, they call you Precious.  I forgot about that.  My man, Precious.  At least they don't call me Thief.  Oh, Jay.  Ooh.  What's up, baby?  Old Dirty, you called my house telemarketing. 
[01:28:00]  Wait a minute.  What was I trying to sell you, son?  You're trying to sell me some kind of crack.  Oh, you just...  Oh, come on, now.  I'm sorry.  I got to know how to do it.  You have to do it, right?  All right.  Syndication with someone rent Sunday days.  Yes, please.  Get out.  Rent my movie.  It's wonderful, terrific, fantastic, marvelous.  At least Adam realized it wasn't.  My little precious white boy.  How are you third today, Old Dirty?  Shut up, Old Dirty.  You third are you better?  Yo, shut up.  Oh, man.  But yo, that's your grandma calling you that, right? 
[01:28:30]  No.  She never officially was my grandma.  Who was calling you?  Yo.  She was a blood grandma.  You don't want to get into it.  No, I didn't get into it today, yo.  All right, Precious.  It's all good.  Not on my birthday.  My birthday.  Yo, your birthday, kid.  What up, man?  Yo, what's this, man?  Making fun of the pronunciation, bro.  We're just making it easier for brothers to talk the language, man.  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  We're trying to put in our own vowels and things like that in it, man.  Come on.  All right.  I'm going to break you in your teeth, man, when I catch you.  All right, so you're coming Thursday to the Roadshow.

Hi.  That's all you want to say?  Who this be?  What?  It's Sandy.

I'll tell you that much.  No.  That's why we came down here for the excitement.  Yeah.  Reynolds brought me up.  And what's your name again?  Eileen.  Eileen, what about you?  No, I won't be participating.  No, no, no.  What's his patient today?  I'll leave it up to Reynolds. 
[01:34:30]  Okay.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  God, that's great.  Wow, Patty.  I never thought I'd see the day that I would have to see your boobs.  I mean, that was wonderful.  Woo!  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  Maybe it's time to end this wow promotion.  It's like your birthday.  I loved it, Patty.  What did you think there, O? 
[01:35:00]  Absolutely great.  You look like cute little boobies.  Hank gets dice and I get Patty Flesham.  This is great.  You told me no strippers.  Bravo.  Thank you, Patty.  Good job, Patty.  Thank you.  Very good, Patty.  Patty, can you say one thing into the microphone for Opie?  Say, I want to touch it.  No, oh, jeez, please.  You're going to make a wretch.  Oh, no, no.  Old Dirty.  Old Dirty. 
[01:35:30]  Did Old Dirty hang up?  I think he was mortified.  He was mortified.  He's had it.  He wish he'd been here.  All right, Tom, what's going on?  Happy birthday, precious.  How did it feel?  How did that feel?  How did it feel?  I'm in shock.  Thank you, Patty.  Bye-bye, Patty.  Bye, Patty.  In the case, when Opie gets in jail.  Good job.  Nice to get up, buddy.  There's no TF in that.  Unless you're packing a number two pencil.  Hello, hello, hello?  Who's on the line? 
[01:36:00]  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Opie, I'm working on a little birthday song for you.  You want to hear it?  Steven.  Steven Lynch.  Who's going to be at the Roadshow Thursday?  Oh, yeah.  You want to hear my song?  Yeah.  So far?  All right.  Down to my target wave.  The coma's broken down all over my face.  I'm going to hear it.  And I wrote a little Road of Helper part.  Damn that hole!  Yeah!  Hello, New York!  Oh, and I wrote so! 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, Thursday, man.  Yeah.  It's going to be huge.  Oh, man.  I have expanded this song to like 15 times its length.  Wait, wait.  So we can confirm that you will be singing FBA?  30 new verses.  The album's version.  The whole album song.  The live at Budokan version.  You think Stairway to Heaven's long?  Isn't that how...  It's twice as long now.  Isn't that how In a God of Devita started?  Yeah.  It's just going to make In a God of Devita sound like a Ramon song. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, awesome.  It'll be 40 minutes long.  Steven, do you know what just happened in this studio?  I think I heard that the Patty, is that her name?  Stalker Patty.  You've seen her before.  I've not seen her before.  Oh, really?  I don't think so.  Then you can't get the full impact of the horror.  From what I'm hearing, was it kind of a horror show?  She wowed an opening.  32 A's.  32 A's.  I want to share with everyone at home, if you want to know what I just saw,  take two eggs, slam them on your counter, 
[01:37:30]  make sure the yolk is very runny.  And you get a nice visual of what I just saw.  Oh.  Wow.  That was great.  I think you just put me off eggs forever.  Yeah.  Wow.  So you're definitely coming.  You're finishing up the new album, Steven.  The album is done.  Uh-huh.  I got the artwork going into the printers.  You're not going to be naked on the cover, are you?  I'm not going to be naked on the cover.  Yeah, that would be ripping us off. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, of course.  It should be good.  There might even be the live FBA from wherever we're going to be on Thursday.  Thursday, yes.  If I get a good enough recording, I don't know.  Oh, man, this is going to be a great Thursday.  We can't wait.  I got Britney Spears dancers.  It's going to be awesome.  Great.  All right, man.  Happy birthday, Elk.  Hey, thanks, Lynchie.  I look forward to Thursday.  Yeah, I'm going to feel much better by Thursday.  All right, I hope so. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  And that Patty thing sure didn't help.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Jim from Jersey is writing, my eyes, my eyes, and I'm listening to the radio.  He was horrified.  I didn't expect that, man.  All right, Lynch.  I'll talk to you guys later.  Cool.  All right, bye.  Can't wait to see you.  Steven Lynch is going to be at the Roadshow Thursday, South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway Island Park.  It's going to be huge.  Directions on the WNEW website and on the unofficial O.P. & Anthony website.  All you need to know, doors open at 2, so get there early. 
[01:39:00]  21 or older, no cover charge.  And lots of debauchery to be had by all.  Please.  People wondering if Stalker Patty is going to try to cut her hair like Sandy.  You know?  I love my hair like this.  Oh, a single white female?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What up, Rick?  Stockbroker Dave has just walked in the building.  Yeah.  Oh, well, get him in here real soon.  It's almost time to play What Would You Do for Stockbroker Dave's Money.  Dave, wow, what happened?  They freaking got the suit right off your back today. 
[01:39:30]  Hi, Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Tough day on Wall Street, huh?  Another difficult day on the street.  All right, let's see the cash that is up for grabs today.  It's not in that bag you carry.  Why not?  Oh, I got to tell you, wait, Ed, this is pretty, God damn it, we got to take a break.  All right.  We're not teasing on my birthday, though.  All right.  No.  I was talking to Dave before the show.  He told me he found the world's largest carrot today down there on Wall Street.  The world's largest carrot. 
[01:40:00]  Wow.  Those are big.  Whoa.  Well, you're right.  Those are the world's largest carrots.  Oh, my God.  Holy.  Yeah, that would be big.  They're close to two feet, man.  That's like mutant carrot size.  Organic dildos.  Ah.  All right.  Well, we're going to...  And what is that?  Oh, my God.  Holy.  Please take...  Asparagus.  Asparagus?  Well, he said today's theme would be fruits and vegetables happening. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  Toss salad.  Toss salad.  Today's your birthday?  Yeah.  I'm under the weather, though.  I know.  I heard you before.  It sucks.  We got some more stuff.  Who gets sick on their birthday?  Grapes.  Grapes.  Fruits and vegetable.  Vegetables and fruits.  From every food?  Yeah.  Do you have an idea what the girl's going to do with all this stuff?  Well, they get more money for creativity, Oak.  Ah.  All right.  Well, we want to see the water bills.  Little baby carrots.  Baby carrots, sure.  Those things can fly across a room. 
[01:41:00]  Shiny apples.  Shiny apple.  Macintosh.  Wow, that's a big apple, though, man.  Delicious.  I don't know if you're going to find anybody that could do anything with that.  It's hot here.  Wow.  There you go.  It's got a wad of mud here, man.  It's hot here.  What are those?  Tangerines or clementines or something?  I don't know.  And, of course, the ever-popular banana.  Na-na.  All right.  All right.  So now we just need some ladies. 
[01:41:30]  Remember that show on the Food Network, Ready, Set, Cook?  They put out the food and you have to do something with it?  This is like Ready, Set, F.  So if there's any ladies near the station that want to win stockbroker Dave's money?  We're talking serious cake here.  Yeah, last time we did this, he gave up $400.  Four beans.  To one girl.  It was insane.  She was a pig, though.  A hooker.  She was a...  You're a hooker?  Who?  I thought I was just doing very well with you. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, we don't want any of them.  Hopes and you're dead.  I don't think we want any hookers today.  7th Avenue and 57th Street, 10th floor.  Come now to win stockbroker Dave's money.  We had a bunch of girls call yesterday.  I don't know where they are.  We'll see if they show up.  Doesn't matter.  Intelligence.  You don't have to be as smart.  You don't have to answer any of those hard questions like Ben Stein makes you do to win his money.  For stockbroker Dave's money, it's purely physical, isn't it?  Yes.  What is somebody going to do with an apple? 
[01:42:30]  Now, haven't you seen it on the Internet?  I've gotten big apple.  I've seen the apple trick.  You've seen the apple one?  Yeah.  I don't buy it.  Prove it to me.  The two apple trick where the apple pops out the other thing.  Oh, my God.  There's an orange.  Yeah.  The orange goes in, the apple pops out, right?  Yeah, I've seen that.  I want to see that live.  I don't know if you're going to get a girl to do that.  We're going to need like a month to get someone to do that for you.  That would be like a Honeymooners episode.  How much you got for that?  Can you, Corey Apple? 
[01:43:00]  How much you got for that?  I'm going to say Wofford.  You might be able to talk a girl into like the apple grape trick.  This is what I want.  You want this?  This is what I want.  You want the world's largest category.  What's up, Don?  Which end?  What's up, Don?  Which end?  Oh, my God.  The fat end or the skinny end?  Where's my whiffable, Matt?  Oh, come on.  It's down the hall.  No one has touched it since the last time you were here.  Welcome to Who Wants to Shove Some Veggies?  All right.  Who's in the hot seat?  Win stockbroker Dave's money. 
[01:43:30]  Ladies, it's time to come down to the station if you're in the area.  If you need rent money, Dave's got your rent money.  You just got to do something with his fruits and vegetables, okay?  Can't go to break just yet.  A little short on your rent money?  A little surprise on line six.  Line six?  For Opie's birthday.  Hello, hello, hello.  Hey, Opie.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, it's my birthday.  I don't need this today.  You know, it's unbelievable.  I keep getting these calls.  What should I do?  Come there and pop out of a cake for you? 
[01:44:00]  What is this?  Birthday's like a week apart.  I know.  I'm in the studio until five in the morning doing what I do with what I got.  Right.  You understand?  They said it was going to be a nice surprise for my birthday.  Yeah, so what happened?  I don't know what happened.  So what are you saying?  I'm not a nice surprise.  No, you're a great surprise.  You know how many times we've used the yam bag line since you last called?  What do you mean use?  Well, we say, you know, we use it.  We are back in court again.  Yam bag.  That's 50 bucks a pop. 
[01:44:30]  Is it that expensive?  Well, you know what?  If you use it over a dozen times, I cut it down to 45.  You got to take a poke.  You understand?  Because you guys, you got champagne taste.  Yeah.  When are you coming to New York?  You're using my stuff.  You got champagne taste.  You picked the cream of the crop.  You guys got me all wound up.  You don't understand what's going on here.  Well, for the first, like, day or two, we would give you credit for your lines, and then we  just said, eh, screw that.  It's okay.  Now we're using your lines.  This is how it works, my friend, birthday boy.  No, how many times we've used the I'm over here now? 
[01:45:00]  This is how it works.  Okay?  Come over here now.  Come over here now.  Now, this is how it works.  It's okay when you use my lines, because I am the genius.  I cannot expect idiots like you to come up with stuff like that.  So if I help you out, everybody stays on the air, and everybody's happy.  I hear you.  You understand what I'm saying?  In the meantime, last night, I'm scratching this chick's butt with my tooth. 
[01:45:30]  You think you could think of that?  I did the clean version of that.  Of course you could.  The worst version you could say for the deriria.  I'm scratching a girl's, what, C-word?  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, the back door?  Behind deriria.  Oh, we used the balloon knot thing, but you didn't like that.  The what?  We say it's the balloon knot.  See, this is why you need me to come up with things like that.  Come on.  Balloon knot's funny.  You see what happened?  Balloon knot's funny.  You were over there, and now I'm where I was. 
[01:46:00]  Where?  That's what you just did to me, Anthony.  Where are you?  But where are you?  I was where I was.  I was over there.  Now I'm where I was.  That's what you just did to me mentally.  No, no, no, no.  Where are you now?  Where was I now?  Where are you now?  I'm over here now.  You're over there, which means I'm where I was.  This is what goes on mentally.  You don't even understand the way I talk.  Nah, nah.  Just pay attention now.  Nah, nah.  Guys, we've been thinking about your album title. 
[01:46:30]  You've got to call it I'm Over Here Now.  No, listen, that's the obvious.  But that phrase is all over the state area now, man.  Oh, like it won't be recorded.  Let me explain what I just did to anybody.  Does anybody tune in to you guys yet?  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  Let me explain what I just did.  Yeah.  Last night I was in the studio until five in the morning.  I told you you got me crazy.  So I went, I made this album deal. 
[01:47:00]  So the album's going to be coming out in August.  All right?  Yeah.  What we did last night, we cut two versions of basically the I'm Over Here Now song.  Oh, nice.  Okay?  Over Here Now song?  Yeah.  I'm over here now.  Boogaloo-loo-loo, boogaloo-loo-loo, boogaloo-loo-loo.  I'm over here now.  That's a sample of it.  That's all you're getting.  That's it.  Boogaloo-loo-loo, boogaloo-loo-loo, boogaloo-loo.  I'm over here now. 
[01:47:30]  It's going to be like the How You Doing song.  No, no.  It's not going to be like anything you ever heard.  Especially the filthy version.  Right.  All the new punk whispers, everything.  It's so insane.  They actually had to restrain me in the studio because we brought in a girl to like, you know,  we needed some, like, you know, like a little banging going on in the background.  Yeah.  It was just, that was banana juice. 
[01:48:00]  I was walking out of there.  My feet were sticking to the floors.  I got to tell you that right now.  That's why I'm surprised I'm where I was because I was over there.  Then I wake up.  I get the call from Club Saw to Kennedy going, you got to be over there now.  How can I be over there when I'm where I was?  Goddamn, man.  Right.  So you said.  Yeah, pretty much.  So you said, right?  Huh?  I indeed did. 
[01:48:30]  What kind of guy do you work with, Anthony?  I indeed did.  I'm just trying to come up.  He sounds worse than the pig farmer we talked about.  It's his birthday.  I think he's been drinking.  I'm just.  Have you been drinking?  No, no.  You getting all licking up?  He's a little sick today.  I'm sick.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Let me pity you.  Let me pity you.  I don't have anything to do, right?  Yeah.  I just got to.  So the other day, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm banging this librarian, right? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going ballistic on this chick.  So she finally says, OK, OK, no late charges.  I shouldn't be anyway.  It's not like I read the book.  I just look at the pictures.  I'm over here now.  Oh, God.  How do you come up with this stuff, Dyson?  I don't know.  I'm up very late every night.  OK.  Now the album.  I had it right.  The I'm over here song.  Yeah.  You guys are going to love this.  This is going to blow everybody's mind.  So the album's going to be done in August? 
[01:49:30]  No.  The album will be out by August.  Oh, out by August.  And then you're coming to New York or what?  What happened?  Over here.  You're coming to New York?  I ain't coming to New York till I do the garden, my friend.  Uh-oh.  In New York, get behind the dice, man.  The garden.  When I come back, I do the garden.  Yeah.  The Olive Garden.  OK.  Yeah.  Your mother's garden.  What do you need?  A crack?  You need a crack now.  The garden.  The guy opens his mouth.  He eats a freaking crack. 
[01:50:00]  What are you guys coming to Vegas?  I was at the garden.  The place was packed.  I was starting the Knicks game.  Should I?  What are you still into playing with balls?  I thought you finally got into chicks.  You still want to sit in a place and once you got bounced a little ball-y?  Hey.  That's what drives me nuts about everybody into sports.  Let's watch the fellas bounce a little ball-y and throw it in the hole.  I could do it a lot better and a lot more entertaining at home.  With my wife, that filthy animal.  I love that woman.  See, that's what went wrong, uh, uh, uh, uh, Amy. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah?  That's what went wrong.  What?  I was thinking about you constantly for the last ten days.  Yeah?  You married the wrong girl.  You think so, does?  Did you ever once get in bed with her and look her right in the eyes as your yambeg is just slapping her fat behind and going,  I love you, you dirty, filthy slob?  You know, thinking back, no.  That's what a woman knows you care about her.  I guess I didn't, uh, do that. 
[01:51:00]  No, do you know why?  Why?  Because this is what happens.  When you go with all their mother girls.  Yeah.  I'm not talking now.  You wouldn't do something like that now because you're in a huge lawsuit.  You don't do those things when you're going to divorce.  You wait till she's completely forgotten, like an old story.  Right.  You know, and that's with the next one.  You make no mistake.  The first night you're with her, you've got to let her know who you are.  So what do I do?  Forget with the old one.  Forget about, you know, every guy breaks up with, this is what happens.  A guy breaks up with a girl or a girl breaks up with a guy. 
[01:51:30]  This is dumb.  This is, I don't want to get angry.  I don't want to get angry.  Get angry.  It's okay.  I don't want to get angry.  Get angry.  I'm an even-tempered guy.  What happens is, this is what guys do, right?  They want to be the big shot and think, oh, I'm going out with my friends.  You want to break up with, then the girl breaks up with you.  But women have zero emotions.  What do you mean?  What happens is a guy breaks up, right?  Yeah.  All of a sudden, he's sitting near the phone every day waiting for the phone to call.  Because we're stupid.  We're the ones that constantly call. 
[01:52:00]  That's what goes on.  We keep calling and we get that goddamn machine, not like the old-time phone that you could wrap  around her throat, you know what I mean, with that wire, and go, I'm on a business call.  You know what I'm talking about?  Sure.  That's a phone.  That phone taught lessons.  I'll tell you that right now.  So we sit near the phone.  How come she didn't call me?  So now you call her.  For the first ten calls, all you get is the machine with her up. 
[01:52:30]  You know, she's going to be up.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  She's going to be in an up mood.  You understand?  Yeah.  And you're going to hear her new answering machine.  This is Rita.  I can't come to the phone right now, but I'll call you back as soon as I come home.  And have a wonderful day.  Like you have been completely forgotten, my friend.  Right?  Right.  Now you finally get her on the phone.  Where you been?  I've been trying to call you. 
[01:53:00]  Don't you think we should talk about this kind of thing?  And she's like, look, we talked about everything.  We have to move on with our life.  Look, I want to talk to you, but I got to go.  I'm going out.  Where are you going?  What, do you got a date?  We're broken up three days.  You got a date?  Look, I don't want to talk about it.  And they hang up on you.  Now you're the idiot that's in the frigging drugstore buying the dopey little cards.  You know, and the little teddy bear and putting it near her front door.  And then you drive around nine times all night long waiting to see if she came up. 
[01:53:30]  Because that's the bank.  Once you see the teddy bear's gone, you know, she took the stupid thing and she's home.  So now you call her up.  How come you didn't call me?  Oh, well, you know, I was just a little busy.  Wait a minute, you filthy frigging whore.  I go out.  During the morning, I buy you the teddy bear.  I buy you the flowers.  I even bought you the frigging Godiva goddamn $4 a piece chocolate.  And I don't even get a call back.  Goddamn. 
[01:54:00]  This is what goes on.  This is what we do.  And then every song that comes on the radio is all of a sudden about you.  Every old stupid Neil Diamond or Burt Manilow, whatever that guy's name is.  You know, we could make the good times happen again.  I write the frigging songs.  This sounds like you're talking from experience here.  And this is what goes on.  My whole life is experience.  So you actually did some of these goofy ass things?  It doesn't fit the dice image. 
[01:54:30]  No, I just leave a bat at the door with my name on it and go, you better call.  No, no.  Every guy goes through this kind of crap.  Yeah.  No, you're the only one in the world that just, you break up and it's all forgotten.  That's you.  You're the tough guy.  Excuse me.  I didn't know who I was talking to.  Well, Anthony has moved on.  Oh, Anthony.  Dice, dice.  I never did that in this situation.  What do you mean?  I didn't do the teddy bear thing because it wasn't, I really didn't care. 
[01:55:00]  You didn't care?  No.  I'm going to break up with you.  No, no.  Who said that?  Who said that's the way it happened?  We tried to explain that to you last time.  Well, what happened?  It just, you know.  What do I do now?  What do I do now?  I was moving on with my life.  Oh, it was your choice.  Well, you know, you could say that in a way.  September 14th.  You know what happens?  A lot goes on.  I forgot.  Yeah.  You got to excuse everything I just said then.  Hey, Dice. 
[01:55:30]  You want to meet someone on the phone?  Do I?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  Okay.  You ever see WWF?  What's that?  You ever see WWF wrestling?  Yeah.  Shane McMahon.  Oh.  Shane O'Mac.  Hey, Shane.  Hey, Shane.  Hey, John.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Hey, thanks, Shane.  What's happening?  We're talking to Dice live from L.A.  Hey, what's up, Dice?  Shane, how you doing?  I'm doing all right.  I'm going to hear you now.  What are you playing?  Shane.  What's up?  Go ahead.  I can't hear you.  Yes, Shane.  What the ho?  Don't.  Don't worry. 
[01:56:00]  You are.  Shane.  Yo.  Shane.  Yes.  Talk to me.  Wait a minute.  Nice.  You should have a conversation.  Talk to me.  They'll just use their phone lines and their bill.  So who are you going to throw around?  Are you going to have a big fight now?  Actually, I just threw around the big show.  Yeah, come on.  Would you just throw 500 pounds?  I tossed him around like an animal.  Shane's the biggest pussy you're ever going to come across, Dice.  Really?  Yeah.  What do you say?  He likes to call himself a cat, like Simba.  Are you like really big right now? 
[01:56:30]  Do you got a t-shirt yet?  Actually, you know what?  I'm going to have to work on that.  I don't have a t-shirt.  Because I'm telling you, that's how I know all these guys become like fake.  You know, they get the t-shirts.  Oh, I ain't got an action figure.  Goldberg.  See, they don't know Goldberg.  See, everybody goes, oh, he's a Jewish guy.  How tough could he be?  Let me tell you something.  That's WCW.  Goldberg went to Yeshiva.  He was young.  He was tough.  He was Yiddish.  He used to walk around the temple with, like, the leather skull cap. 
[01:57:00]  Not even the fabric.  Leather.  They had toothpicks with the cellophane at the end.  Dice, we don't care about Goldberg.  Oh, we don't?  No.  No, you've got to talk about the WWF.  No, but I thought Shane was going to fight him.  No.  No.  I don't think Goldberg said about him.  I don't know.  I see Dice really knows a lot about Shane.  I don't want to start a problem between those two.  Shane, yeah, you really push it out.  You like him, Shane?  Well, I don't really like The Rock, but you know.  The Rock kicked his ass last night. 
[01:57:30]  There's another guy.  What show were you watching?  The Rock got in the ring and bitch slapped you, Shane.  Please.  It was hysterical.  Wait a minute.  And then Shane does the best thing he can do, runs out of the building.  You were hysterical, man.  And when you got thrown against the Titantron?  I don't recommend it.  Hysterical.  Your neck snapped back.  I was like, what is this guy?  He's a millionaire, a multi-millionaire's son, the son of WWF's Vince McMahon, 
[01:58:00]  and he's letting this big lug throw him against steel beams.  I tell you the truth, we don't have much of a choice.  Really?  No, he's amazing.  Well, you so pussied out.  You had everybody and their brother in there helping you out.  Yeah, but I won.  You won.  I won, Shane.  Why are you standing for their nonsense?  No, Mr. Tate, I'm amused.  I'm amused by them.  Are you really?  It amuses.  You're like an even-tempered wrestler.  Yeah, even-tempered.  He knows what the truth is.  Everybody's beating you up. 
[01:58:30]  You've got to get in there.  You've got to take command.  So I need some attitude.  Yeah, you've got to yell at them a little bit.  Dice and his sisters.  You've got to make fun of what they wear or their head.  Dice, his sister's a $2 whore.  Who's that, Shane?  Yeah.  I can't believe you're picking on this guy like that.  I don't know if I can argue.  Hey, Shane, I'll tell you what.  I take your sister and I fold her in half.  I give her to every banana.  You're a little friggin' sissy Mary.  That's why I pick you, Shane. 
[01:59:00]  You tell me I'm getting on the phone with like this big red.  This guy's like afraid of a mouse.  When there's like a fly in the house, you make your wife go after it.  Dice, if you confronted Shane, he would be all big and tough, and then he would run away from you as fast as he could.  Well, we've got to build this guy's confidence.  He sounds like he's half retarded in some way.  You know, Dice, I need to come out to L.A.  You don't even talk like a restaurant.  He's another farmer.  Where are you from?  Aren't you from Brooklyn?  I'm from Brooklyn.  Right.  So you're in the streets. 
[01:59:30]  You know, you grew up the school of hard knocks.  Now you're out in L.A.  So you've got, you know, East Coast, West Coast experience, life experience.  Shane, you sound like a friggin' school teacher.  Oh, you know where he is?  You can teach me the ropes.  Dice, he's from the mean streets of Greenwich, Connecticut.  Oh.  That's like a teeth ball, my friend.  But we're not talking about the right thing here.  What are we even talking about, Chase?  Walking around Greenwich Village with your little purse.  No, Greenwich, Connecticut.  Greenwich, Connecticut, you're tall.  I can slap on a pair of heels. 
[02:00:00]  Friggin' sissy Mary.  I'll come over there.  I'll give you a crack.  Greenwich, Connecticut.  It's funny.  It's funny.  Dice is from New York.  He doesn't even hear the geography.  He needs a geography lesson.  Yeah.  What are you talking about in Hollywood too long?  What'd you say?  Greenwich Village or Greenwich, Connecticut?  Greenwich, Connecticut.  Connecticut, man.  Connecticut, yeah, what a hell.  It's the same thing.  You've got the Pagatitos there too.  Is that like the part of Brooklyn, Jersey you're from, Dice?  What happened? 
[02:00:30]  That's like the part of Brooklyn, New Jersey that you're from.  I don't know what this Jersey thing is.  I think you say that just to make me mad, Dice.  Jersey's a lot like Brooklyn.  Different haircuts, I admit.  You know, Jersey's a state right next to New York and Connecticut.  That's right on the border.  You're just trying to make me so stupid.  Hence the Triste area.  It's like trying to make a burnt line.  If I stop talking, you know what happens?  What?  The show dies right now with you as a guest.  Oh, really?  That's what happens. 
[02:01:00]  That's right, bright eyes.  I wouldn't even let him talk to you like that.  I know.  If he was here, he'd know I'd kick his ass.  Exactly.  Why?  Because you're big.  You're a big stopper.  I'll give you a crack, you fool, right down.  Come here, because I'm over here now, Dice.  Okay?  Okay?  Dice now.  Okay?  Is this the cute, cuddly Dice from the new EV show?  Say what?  Hey, what are you doing?  Reading?  What are you sitting in the toilet? 
[02:01:30]  Oh, I told you I'm in Indiana.  I got terrible phone system here.  It's like an Indiana.  Four-second delay.  You got a lot of filthy slobs out there, too.  I'll tell you that right now, Shane.  You got the big corn heifers down here.  I get off the plane with my sack hanging out.  20 ounces.  Nobody believes me.  What the hell are you talking about?  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Hey, Shane.  20 ounces, and that's just a head.  Shane.  Yo.  Undertaker.  Looking huge.  Oh, he's amazing.  Great comeback. 
[02:02:00]  You know, we were a little disappointed when Stone Cold came back and looked really bad.  But, you know, I understand he needs a lot more therapy or something.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a big step neck.  Yeah, he was kind of stiff.  So when we heard rumors that the Taker was coming back, when he came back, oh, my God.  The guy's huge.  He came back strong.  Guys, anything to add to this conversation?  Why are you talking about Stone Cold?  You don't want to talk about Goldberg.  You don't want to talk about The Rock.  Now you're talking about Stone Cold.  Goldberg is in wheelchair wrestling. 
[02:02:30]  That's WCW.  That's the wheelchair wrestling league.  They're all a bunch of idiots.  WC this, WC that.  You're like Japan.  How they broke Japan up into, like, Japs and Chinks and Mongoloids.  So many of them, they had to break them up like in different sessions.  You know what I mean?  That's what they do over there.  Goddamn, Dice.  You never disappoint.  There's a phenomenal freaking popcorn over there that's so tiny.  Dice, Dice. 
[02:03:00]  That's why you can fit 15, 20 of them in them little cars they make.  All right, Dice, what do you want to say about The Rock, then?  Yeah.  I have nothing to say about The Rock.  Oh, okay.  I'm just saying, do you know him?  Of course.  He's got attitude.  Yes, he does.  I look forward to straightening it out.  Probably Thursday.  It's Thursday.  What do you mean, straight?  What do you think?  You're going to have a sit down and go, look, I really don't like the things you said about me?  I'm going to try that approach first.  You don't recommend it?  No.  No, Dice, here's what he's going to do. 
[02:03:30]  He's going to be in the ring.  And any time you say something about somebody's mother, they lose complete control, and you  can stay calm and just break his neck. 
[02:04:00]  Shane's going to talk all bad to The Rock, and then The Rock will come out, and Shane  will get thrown around a little, and then 15 guys will come out and start beating on The  Rock, and Shane will make it seem like he did it by himself.  There you go.  That's not a bad plan.  Why?  You use it every time.  All right, Shane, let's practice.  All right, now, I'm The Rock.  Get in the ring.  Say something.  Hey, you.  No, wrong.  Wrong.  That's wrong.  Right off the bat.  Really nice.  The minute you look at him, you go, your mother. 
[02:04:30]  Your mother, right there.  That's it?  Your mother.  Then he'll go berserk.  Then we remove his fist from my mouth.  Why are you a wrestler if you're so afraid of getting hurt?  Well, I'm not technically a wrestler.  He is the son of Vince McMahon, the head of the WWF.  He's the one that he talks like.  Yeah, you ever see Vince?  He's like the head guy.  Yeah, I know Vince is.  Vince McMahon, you'll be coming in for a cornhole match.  Yeah, no, I don't know.  He's always naming them. 
[02:05:00]  You backed them.  He's good.  I like Vince.  He's around a long time.  Yeah.  He didn't take too much time to teach his son how to deal with other people in this world.  No, he deals with them.  He deals with them exactly like Vince deals with them.  In Greenwich, Connecticut.  He gets all bloody and runs away.  Hey, there's some tough areas in Greenwich.  I know.  There's Starbucks.  It's actually right behind the alley around Starbucks.  You go to his coffee. 
[02:05:30]  You walk into the...  Isn't it amazing the language you've got to know when you go in these places?  You have to know like a whole language for coffee today.  God forbid, you know, because you've got to wait 40 minutes.  God forbid you get to the front of the line and you don't know what you want to offer.  You've got to know like every Puerto Rican language from New York to El Salvador.  Or you can't just go, give me coffee, you know.  Give me coffee.  Okay, okay, gentlemen. 
[02:06:00]  You don't have to banana juice store.  Yeah, do that.  Your own homemade banana juice.  Very good.  Let me explain something.  My stuff is nutritious.  The heck with Baskin' and Robbins.  I come in 33 flavors.  I love you.  The chocolate truffle chunk hurts when it comes out the tip a little.  But it's worth it.  Guys, you are freaking disgusting.  I love it.  What are you doing about disgusting?  Everybody goes home a winner with me.  Well, Shane, hang up on him. 
[02:06:30]  We love Shane.  We couldn't even get Vince McMahon.  We had to get his kid.  Get your father on the phone.  I've got to talk to him.  I'm calling you.  I'm out.  I'm calling you.  You know what I mean?  Oh, that's funny.  Why don't they just call you Baby Boy in the ring?  There you go.  Wow.  They call him Pussy.  No, Baby Boy.  Baby Boy's going to beat you up?  You know what I mean?  Baby Boy make banana juice? 
[02:07:00]  You married Shane.  Yeah, you ought to see him so, why?  Exactly.  Like I never saw a chick with big boobs and a nice fat ass.  Very attractive.  That doesn't happen, Molly.  You don't see any of that walking around.  No, I need to come to Greenwich to see your wife.  I see your wife.  She leaves you.  I'm not handsome.  She's a New Yorker, Dice.  Very attractive, Dice.  Yeah, talk to me about her.  She's a New Yorker.  Yeah, she's just a very attractive girl.  So she's got that voice like, he's so handsome, it just makes me want to plod. 
[02:07:30]  Not exactly.  Where's the Bayshore, Long Island?  She's from Brooklyn.  What are we talking about?  You know what I mean, Shane?  What?  Where are you?  What are you doing now?  Write it down on a piece of paper.  I'm an Indian.  I'm an Indian.  Yeah, so where's your wife?  My wife's home.  Can we get her on the phone?  Negative.  What do you mean?  We're not in outer space now.  We're not in a space rocket. 
[02:08:00]  I don't need positive, negative retro rockets on.  Negative.  God damn you, too.  Shane, what?  Wrestling was like, you know what?  Maybe I'll get into wrestling.  If I've got to fight guys like Shane, we can grab his little finger and I'll bend it back.  Now, Shane, you're sorry, baby boy.  Guys, I don't know, Shane, against a lot of the wrestlers, he's a big pussy and runs away.  But I think...  I'll kill you.  I think he'd kick your ass off.  You know, you're tough on the phone, just like Aunt Nate, just like Jay Moore was. 
[02:08:30]  Everybody's a tough guy.  I'll come down, I'll give you a crack in the head.  You should see this.  There's tape of Shane flying over the top ropes.  Hey, Shane, you know what?  Actually, I saw that movie.  You were like the brain smasher.  Yeah.  Okay, you got the kills.  You got the kills.  It's a movie, stupid ass.  You got the kills.  I gotta give that to you.  It's a movie.  What are you running, guys?  I'm thinking you're like, what are you, 6'2 or something?  Yep.  What do you weigh?  240?  240. 
[02:09:00]  I'll put you up against Club Soda Kenny in a minute.  He racked your brains in.  Club Soda Kenny.  He's a tag team champion.  Dice and Club Soda Kenny.  Yeah.  I don't want to go against the Hardy Boys in a lot of the guys.  Less than three minutes.  So it takes two of you to take on me.  No, no.  I'm not involved.  I'm just going to go.  Okay.  All right, kids.  Can't have you fighting like this.  I'm not fighting.  I'm a koala bear.  You're finally going to come kick your ass. 
[02:09:30]  That's right.  Who's going to come?  The koala bear.  Besides me?  Oh, boy.  Well, I'm sure Shane's glad he called in.  Shane, I'm sorry.  We got off to a bad start.  As usual.  There's not one person.  If he sweats at me, I'm going to come out there.  I'm going to beat you up.  There's not one person that gets on the phone with Dice that he doesn't have to say,  I think we got off to a bad start.  No, no.  It's not my fault.  I'm going to beat you up with his big head on the phone. 
[02:10:00]  His head's got to weigh 45 pounds, this guy's Shane.  I can't believe your father got you into the business.  Yeah.  What kind of idiot is this man?  He's a genius.  It's like a mob guy going, I want my son to grow up to be the killer I am.  It doesn't work.  You know what I mean?  It worked like tenfold.  Yeah, it's working nice.  It's great.  In the meantime, by the time you're 40, you're going to be retarded from getting kids. 
[02:10:30]  Well, now he's got a point.  I've seen Shane do some massive abuse.  I've seen Shane do some massive abuse.  I've seen Shane do some nice home, walking around going, I'm Dane.  My name is Dane.  And what's your wife going to be doing when that happens?  You know what she's going to be?  She's going to be with the black ex-wrestling midget.  You know that guy?  The midget, okay?  Yeah, the midget.  The little creepy midget.  Hey, Dice, you living in LA now?  The midget is like torrential rain.  It's impossible to get a word in edge-wise, Shane.  Dice, you living out in LA? 
[02:11:00]  I'm over here now.  So next time we're at the Staples Center or the pond in Anaheim, you have to come by?  No, when I'm at the Staples Center, maybe you come by.  Don't tell me no famous big shot.  Dice will be at Staples selling paperclip.  I didn't know you were the big shot.  You didn't know that?  Well, let me inform you.  I just think I did.  I didn't know you were the big shot, Shane.  Exactly.  Let me say it again.  Point A, I'm in Indiana.  Point B, yes, I am the big shot and I run things. 
[02:11:30]  That's how it works for you, really.  That's how it works for you.  I was going to let you work hard.  I'm going to take your leg.  I'm going to wrap it around that big stupid head of yours and crush it like a walnut.  How about I do that, Shane?  You and Soda Pop Willie, right?  Then I'm going to grab your wife and I'm going to hunt her on a banana.  Soda Pop Willie.  Give her two pints of banana juice.  Bring Soda Pop.  Everybody goes home with banana juice.  Well, Soda Pop is something else.  That's what I call the banana juice float.  Lovely. 
[02:12:00]  You know what I mean?  You get a little whipped banana juice cream.  Goddamn, you guys are killing me.  I call in to wish the guy a nice, happy little birthday.  Right.  I call in to wish the guy a nice, happy little birthday.  I call in.  I call in.  I'm talking to everyone back there.  I'm talking to Rick and everybody.  And they say, God, you know, we do anything to get dice off the phone.  He hogs all the time.  Excuse me, my friend.  I say, okay.  I'm going to carry this guy for at least 10, 15 minutes.  But, you know, going on 325, all I know is your stupid yellow teeth. 
[02:12:30]  He's got, I get a quote that they, they, they, they.  Yellow teeth.  Are you getting tongue-peed?  Where's all your material now?  Your birthday boy.  Where's your birthday?  Yeah, all your material.  Yellow teeth now?  Where are you going back to grade school?  Yeah.  Now, I know that's what you're dating these days, but you don't come on.  That's what I do.  Right.  Exactly.  Grade schoolers.  Or maybe I need a teacher like you.  Shane, what, are you taping a TV show? 
[02:13:00]  No, I'm just saying, I've seen you in your little G-string.  G-string?  You know those pictures?  I've seen you in your little G-string.  That thing is so small, when you bang your wife, it's like doing Morse code.  De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  I'm over here now because everybody said what?  Come on, you know, Shane, I'll tell you the truth.  I never even heard of you until you called in.  Shane, we got off on a bad start.  We got off to a bad start.  We got off a bad start.  Somehow, Anthony always gets me in arguments. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, me?  It's my fault.  There is nobody sweeter and more delicate and sensitive than myself.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying, Shane?  I'm hearing you.  I'll tell you the truth.  I don't know what you look like.  I don't know if all I know you're a mailman or something.  No, that was you in that TV series that bomb.  You're my COP's brother for all I know.  What do I know?  It's actually second cousin.  Yeah, you got to start watching the WWF there, Dice.  How come up you don't talk when I call in?  That's what I don't understand.  Because there's nothing better than you going at it with phone callers, Dice.  What are you talking about? 
[02:14:00]  This seems to be a very nice person.  I don't need it.  Shane's a wonderful guy.  I don't need to talk when you're going at it.  No, but you're the guys.  I said this guy's a pussy.  He's an impact at home.  What?  He's the guy leaving the little teddy bear with the card.  What?  You lost me now.  Wow.  Shane, is this your first wife?  Yes.  Really?  Did you go with any other girls before her?  Actually, no.  Really?  Yeah.  You freaking idiot. 
[02:14:30]  First one.  So how do you know that she's the best?  Because it's the only one I've ever had.  That's stupid.  You're on the road.  You're in Illinois.  Do you know what slobs are walking around that town?  They're a trailer park.  You just bang the door open.  Honey, I'm home.  You bang the door open?  Really?  You take out the carrot stick, you start wiggling night jump.  Hold on.  I'm trying to write all this down.  You got to work out a lot. 
[02:15:00]  You're restless.  But if you're banging them from behind, am I allowed to say that, fellas?  Sure.  Sure.  All right.  You got to take like a protein bar and use like the other eggs that they got to just keep  one over there.  So if you're losing steam, you take a bite.  Keep carved up.  I mean, maybe a carb.  Carved up, right?  A combo ball.  Beautiful.  You know what I mean?  To get the energy going.  So you can really just slam away.  Whack bag.  You should put it down on it, guys.  Whack bag. 
[02:15:30]  Remember that word when you're in bed.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  In the back door.  Okay, Dice.  Okay, terrific.  Lovely.  Great.  Yeah, and you start sound off.  Say hello to Sergeant Pop.  I can't say the C word.  No, of course not.  Rub it's head and twist the top.  You know what I mean?  I'm hearing you.  Take it down.  Do the thing.  All right.  Listen. 
[02:16:00]  You know, Shane is a very busy man.  I'm sure, Dice, you have a lot of things to do.  Yeah, I do have a lot of things.  And I thought I was just, I mean, I'm trying to give this guy love advice.  Obviously, he's going through some kind of problem with his wife if he's living in Illinois.  He's not.  You know?  You know, you probably got her negligees and you probably come in into pink cheese strings.  This is going on.  Do a good workout or something.  And you've got to be thinking, look, she don't pay attention.  And you're thinking, who?  For who?  For her?  For what?  Forget about it. 
[02:16:30]  You know what I mean?  All you all dressed up, shoes by Fat Agamo.  For who?  For her?  For what?  Forget about it.  I'm over here.  Shane feels like he's in the Iron Man match now.  It's just going on for an hour.  That's what you've got to say, Shane.  When she goes, I don't like this right, Scott.  I took you here for a reason.  And then you start thinking, for who?  For what?  For what?  Forget about it.  How do you spell forget about it?  Does it got a G in it?  There's no one. 
[02:17:00]  It's like this.  For who?  For what?  For what?  Forget about it.  You're in bed with a, I'm over here now.  20 ounces, nobody believes me.  I didn't know what the freaky thing is.  That's when you get off the plane.  You know what I mean?  Why?  You get off the plane, you bring her into the toilet in the bedroom, you have a couple laughs.  You know what I mean?  All right.  I'll do all this for you.  For all, for Huffleup.  I better forget about it. 
[02:17:30]  I think Shane needs to go.  I'm going to hang up.  I give a crap for him.  All of a sudden, he's like my brother.  I can't.  He's got to go.  What are you going to do?  Are you in your tights?  Get out of here.  Come give you a crack.  I'm out of here, guys.  Happy birthday to you, Obie.  Hey, Shane.  Thank you.  Shane, thanks a lot, man.  Take care, Shane.  And I'll be one last thing for you.  Hang up.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to hear what he has to say.  Shane. 
[02:18:00]  For you, Dyson.  Oh, you want to play that?  How about I do this now?  How about I do this?  What I can do to you?  Hey, this is what I do to you.  See if you can match this song.  Go ahead.  How about I do this now?  Look what I just did.  Because I'm the kind of idiot that's got so much time on my hand. 
[02:18:30]  I submit.  I submit.  I submit a phone.  And you're on a phone submission match.  Obviously, nothing's going on in the bedroom if you're hanging out with a phone figuring out songs.  I'm just going over your notes.  Keep it all.  I'm going to try all those things you told me.  And the pink G-string.  I just ordered that.  Pink G-string.  I'm telling you.  That's a turn-on.  And black bag.  You know what I mean?  Black bag.  Black bag.  That's only from mine.  Black bag.  You know what I mean?  You get one of them little whips.  You give a little smack at the ass a little red. 
[02:19:00]  Nicey-nice.  Good for you.  I'm over here now because you said.  All right.  Thank you.  That's what you said at the end.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, good luck marketing your new carbo fuel.  Okay?  I wish you luck.  You know, Dice-o-matic.  I'll see you guys later.  Thank you, Shane.  All right.  There you go, Shane McMahon.  There he goes.  Do you see what you're doing, Anthony?  I do.  We've had Shane McMahon on plenty of times.  And it's never been a problem with any other guest. 
[02:19:30]  But for some reason, Dice, you always bring out the conflict in people.  I didn't say one word to this guy.  What did I say?  See?  Big head, yellow teeth.  You're going to wrap his leg around his head.  Does he really got yellow teeth?  He's got a small thing, and his wife did it.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I slipped once or twice.  The guy got me aggravated.  All right.  I saw that happen there with him.  I called in to wish a nice happy birthday.  And all of a sudden, I get, you know, a little Shane McMahon on the phone. 
[02:20:00]  A baby boy.  Well, Dice, I appreciate it.  Now that we're an hour later.  Yeah, now we've got to do commercials for about an hour.  Well, I've got to do things, too.  All right.  You do things.  I've got to do what I've got to do and what I've got.  And get back out to New York, huh?  I will be there.  You want you live.  No, he's supposed to fly us to Vegas so we can see that show over there.  That's true.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I didn't say I'd fly you.  Come on.  Fly us.  I didn't say that.  Remember, we inspired you.  You guys are the big shots. 
[02:20:30]  We inspired you, Dice.  Remember that.  Fly us out.  You can inspire me.  Fly us out to Vegas.  Come on, Dice.  You inspired me.  I only got half the money I had.  Right.  Don't worry about it.  Everything's going to be okay.  Thank you, Dice.  All right, Dice.  Forget about it.  All right.  Look, I'm going to go.  You guys are terrific.  Happy birthday to Opie, I guess.  Yeah, whatever.  You know, he don't talk.  He's getting drunk on here.  That's wrong.  All right, Dice.  You know what I mean?  So I've got to go over here now because everybody said that to me.  All right.  Okay, boy.  Why don't I know just when I hang up? 
[02:21:00]  Just hang up.  Yeah.  All right.  Hang up.  Bye, Dice.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Oh, my God.  Go and say anything about Dice because they'll call right back.  The frickin' Dice.  Oh, say a word.  Shane McMahon match.  A touch-tone phone match.  Shane submitted.  Don't say anything bad.  If you want to look at the wrestling stats there, Dice got Shane to submit in the phone-tone  death match. 
[02:21:30]  Right, right.  Club Soda Candy's listening right now.  That had to be some of the most retarded phone conversations, the most retarded exchange  I've ever heard between two human beings.  I thought he referred to the mongoloids in Japan.  The mongoloids in Japan.  He comes out with this stuff.  It's hysterical.  Can we get Dice back?  Not Dice.  Can we get Shane back on the line?  Oh.  I just want to make sure he was cool with all that. 
[02:22:00]  I'm sure he was.  He's a fun guy.  He sounded like he was having a good time.  Yeah, he knows.  He was laughing at Dice at Dice.  Really, all right, having a good time.  We're still waiting for some ladies to show up to win Stockbroker Dave's money.  Yes.  We have Stockbroker Dave's cash.  Plenty of cash.  We're talking like serious cake-age.  Yeah, we're not talking like 50 bucks or something.  No, no.  We're talking hundreds.  And there's bananas, carrots, huge carrots.  These things are like two feet long.  Grapes, oranges, apples, and asparagus spears for some reason. 
[02:22:30]  But, yeah, we're just looking for a girl to come up and creatively use these items for cash prizes.  What else can you say?  Win Stockbroker Dave's money.  We've got to take a break.  We are so late.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't stick to.  You're such a bummer.

It's time to pop the question.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  You get the birds chirping, the flowers.  Love in the air.  Mmm, love.  Holy matrimony.  And the lawyers circling.  Ah, yes, like vultures circling high above you.  But there's nothing you can tell anybody.  You're going to get married.  So if you're going to, I guess you might as well do it right.  Go to the Diamond Exchange.

[02:24:30]  Britney Spears.  We don't play her music.  But we'd sure like to pin our legs back like a Tyson chicken.  Radio Gonzo style.  O.P. and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Yeah.  Radio Gonzo style.  I like that new one, man.  Gonzo.  Perfect timing, too, because we're checking out Britney Spears' Camel Town.  Yeah, I've got to thank the guy that sent that. 
[02:25:00]  Who is he?  Where did he go?  That picture's all over the Internet.  In her new video where she's wearing that red latex outfit,  Violent K sent it in from Staten Island.  Look at that.  She's smuggled a yo-yo in the front of her pants there.  She's wearing a red rubber outfit,  and she has a frontal wedgie going where, I mean,  you could see the entire vag.  It's right there.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Yeah.  Vagina. 
[02:25:30]  Yes.  It's right there.  Very puffy.  Hello.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right, man.  Happy birthday.  Hey, thank you.  Dude, I was on Route 46 before.  Yeah.  When Dice and Shane were going at it.  Yeah.  I must have swerved about, like, four times out of the way of cars.  I missed the divider by, like, a half an inch.  That was hilarious.  Oh, it was nuts.  But the thing is, what's the deal with Dice, man?  You know, he's a big tough guy.  Why'd he push a little, you know, faggot button for it?  It's like the weakest button of all of them. 
[02:26:00]  You know, the funniest thing is, Dice has no idea what Shane looks like or does, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  But, you know, you see Shane in the ring.  He's a pretty big guy.  He's not that small.  Believe me.  Right, right.  And he can take a beating.  Oh, it's nuts.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  You tell.  Opie?  I know, real fast.  We'll go to Big Cab first.  I guess we have a surprise for Opie.  I see that on line six.  I think the surprise is Jay Moore.  Oh, is it?  Live from Canada.  But first, Big Cab.  Big Cab, what's up? 
[02:26:30]  Real fast.  We got Jay on the other line.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jeff Norris, and I have arrived.  Jeff Norris, and you have arrived at the WOW sticker stop for today?  Jeff and I are here, and there are 150 people here, and they're very loud.  I had to come inside the store just to be able to hear you.  All right.  Sorry if the phone's crapping out.  No, it sounds fine.  Let me give the plug real fast, dude, because we've got to move on with the show.  All right, Kev?  Okay.  It's Big Cab.  He's with Jeff Norris handing out the brand-new WOW stickers at, what's the name of the place?  It's not here.  It's Babbage's GameStop. 
[02:27:00]  GameStop.  GameStop, that's right.  Located on Route 22 East in Union, New Jersey, across from Coconuts Music, right?  Okay.  You guys will be there for about an hour giving out the brand-new WOW stickers?  We'll be there.  They're yelling like crazy, happy birthday, Oak.  Hey, thank you, Big Cab.  Hey, no problem.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, sorry about that.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.  Hello.  Hello, precious.  Hey, Jay, what's up?  You little diamond dust there.  Happy birthday, precious.  I thought after your politically incorrect appearance, you forgot all about the O.P. 
[02:27:30]  and Anthony show.  Let me tell you something.  Never in my life will there be a day, but I don't think for at least a second, I'm taking  a dump.  I'm not going to say when it will happen, but at least one second of each day, I think of  you guys.  Oh, cool.  How great was that that I got it off twice?  Because I wasn't sure if they were going to edit the show, because I didn't stop talking  the whole time I was on, because I had to carry funny on my back for 22 minutes, because  everyone else was retarded.  Dude, you saved that show, believe me. 
[02:28:00]  The other two chicks were just stupid.  It was horrible.  I put the show on my back and carried up the funny hill.  I wasn't sure if they were going to edit it or not, so I had to make sure I said,  okay, terrific, at least twice.  Yeah.  Cool.  They got in.  That was great.  I'm trying to get it in this movie.  You're trying to get it in the movie?  Yeah, there's a movie.  This chick's got me at gunpoint.  Lyra Flynn Boyle has me at gunpoint.  Her and James Spader are arguing.  Yeah.  And I'm on the ground in my underwear, and I stand up, and my line, as written, is, well,  you two obviously have some things to work out.  And they go, get down! 
[02:28:30]  And I get back down, but I want to stand up and go, okay, terrific.  That's pretty good.  I go, get down!  Okay, terrific.  Get that in the movie, man.  That'd be hysterical.  Hey, Jace Kersen.  Sorry about that.  That's all right.  Go ahead.  I'm in Canada, man.  They make you current.  I've always been prejudiced against the Canadians.  Now it's really...  They strip-searched my friend and sent them home.  No way.  It's Calgary.  Traveling all black, I think, was the offense.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  And he said the worst part of being strip-searched is he packed all his good underwear.  So he's wearing, like, his, like, period underpants with the white ones with the holes in them  and the little hearts.  He's like a brother.  And he's, like, you know, tried himself on being all cool.  And they're like, all right, take off your clothes.  And he's like, oh, man, let me change into the Calvins.  Yeah.  So what are you guys doing on this momentous occasion?  Oh, it's just a zany show today, Jay.  Dice called in again and took over about an hour and a half of our show. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  What language was he speaking?  He was all over the place.  He was pretty funny.  I got to say.  I'm over here now.  Google me.  Hey, back to Google.  Wow.  Did you hear the phone call?  Because that's exactly...  Who was he getting in a fight with?  Shane McMahon from the WWF.  Oh, I thought it was, like, Shane Mosley or somebody.  No, no.  Shane McMahon.  I'm excited.  What was it being for...  Who cares?  Let's keep it positive.  Let's keep it positive.  So you're up there for what...  Hey!  This can go? 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Thanks a lot.  That's my neighbor.  All right.  I'm being told to tell you to hold on.  You hold on, Jay, for two seconds.  Okay.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Jay.  I have another two.  What?  Sandy is coming in with another surprise for Opie.  Dude.  Hey!  Oh, no.  It's Marco.  It's gay Marco.  Jay.  Hey.  Hey. 
[02:30:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  He's just wearing, like, little show-me-your-lunch shorts.  My birthday cake says happy...  Happy birthday.  My birthday cake says happy birthday, precious.  Sam, why are you getting a gay guy to get me my cake?  Oh, he's putting the cake down by his crotch.  He wants Opie to blow the candles out.  Get that cake.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Jay, your boyfriend's here.  Hey.  No, we broke up, man.  You broke up. 
[02:31:00]  Hey, Marco.  We have incredible differences.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  All right.  Marco's here, Jay.  Hey, precious.  I think he wants to talk to you.  Hi, Jay.  Hi, queer.  Oh, no.  Tag basher, Mark.  Jay, I have another boyfriend now.  Oh, thank God.  Put the carrot down.  Oh, that's too little.  Oh.  Let me let Jay in on what's going on here. 
[02:31:30]  We also have Stockbroker Dave in the studio today, and we play a game every once in a while  called Win Stockbroker Dave's Money.  Hi, Jay.  Hi, Jay.  And he brought in, like, the world's largest carrot, and Marco is really high in that carrot  right now.  It's too little.  The world's largest carrot.  I brought you lots of birthday presents.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You sound gayer than a leather pinata.  I mean, when I met you, you were gay, but now... 
[02:32:00]  I missed Anthony.  Yes, you did.  Thank God.  Hold on.  Marco, when I met you, you were gay, but now...  You must have went to, like, gay camp.  Hey.  Hey.  Fine-tune your gay skills, because now you're really gay.  He brought a six-pack of Heineken, and it's got the gay rainbow flag in it and everything.  The fag flag.  The first, first, Opie, I wrote you a birthday poem.  Oh, wait a minute.  He wrote, Opie, a birthday poem, Jay.  This has got to be great.  Hey.  My precious Opie, ever since our first meeting, when we shared that first kiss, I find you 
[02:32:30]  invading my fantasies.  Oh, God.  What's that?  And in them, invading so much more.  But more than anything...  But more than anything involving hot wax or analese...  Anuses.  Anuses.  My desire is to put my junk between your luscious man-breaths and give you a pearl necklace.  What the hell is going on?  Anuses.  What day?  You don't even run. 
[02:33:00]  Opie, I knew nothing about this.  Jay, help me out here.  We've got a poem, Ryan's necklace with sandwich.  Do your query.  I saw you with the sound cam.  The gay cam.  Get the hell out of here.  I'm not...  Get the hell out of here.  Okay.  One of those fag cards with the guy on there.  No, no.  And open it up with the guy there.  Open it up.  Open it up.  What?  What's in it? 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  It's the naked guy with his junk.  Open, here's your gay flag.  June is gay pride month, everyone.  Don't forget.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Shut up!  When did Marco turn it to a rerun for what's happening?  Gay pride, don't forget much.  Can you hand these over to Opie?  Hey!  No, Stan, Stan.  You're supposed to be helping me out.  It sounds like Big Gay Al.  Here's your first present.  Big Gay Al.  Wait, is this from you?  Oh, no. 
[02:34:00]  I can only imagine what that is.  Is this from you, Marco?  It's porno, yes.  It's porno, all right.  I can only imagine what it...  Oh, my God.  It's got to be the most heinous gay porno ever.  Let me see.  What do we got?  Gay pride.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is he doing?  Jay, help us out here.  Marco, do you...  Hey, porno.  Yeah.  Marco, do you do a lot of things that are on the video box now?  I've done them all. 
[02:34:30]  I'm a stranger.  Let me ask Marco a question, okay?  All right.  Yes, Jay.  Marco, since it's Opie's birthday, we're going to...  You know, the fans think everybody's funny and all, but I think they need to...  I mean, everybody learns things on this show.  What's the...  Well, he was quite large.  He was probably about the size of two beer cans stacked on top of each other.  Two beer cans of paper.  All right, listen.  I'm getting a lot of gay presents right now.  Is this black guy?  A little anal-ese.  Yes. 
[02:35:00]  Does it look like a roll of tar paper?  A tar paper.  A roll of tar paper.  I'm Craig online, too.  Marco is as queer as a tennis helmet.  What kind of cream is on the cake?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's cannoli.  Jesus.  I'm not opening any more gay presents.  Triple red.  Opie, you've got to open one more present named Marco. 
[02:35:30]  I'm here.  Oh, my God.  That's why I brought the analese.  Oh, my God.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Traveling side, analese?  Opie, you got tools.  Ant gets hot bitches.  Dice first calls in, like, ten years.  Otto and George for the first time.  You get gay Marco and a chick with hairy nipples.  Yeah, I don't know what was more heinous.  It's gay Marco or Patty's boob. 
[02:36:00]  I just got to say, thank God my birthday falls first in the year.  What the hell do you do with this?  Because I want to give you a pro necklace.  God, I can only imagine.  Those are beads.  What are the...  Patty's a psycho Patty?  Yeah, psycho Patty flashed Opie, her boobage.  Oh, man.  Did it look like the witch from Bugs Bunny?  It was pretty heinous.  Hey, Jay, you going to miss...  Those are going to be some strange boobies, man. 
[02:36:30]  Jay, you're going to be missing our roadshow Thursday.  I know.  I'm in Calgary.  I think I'm going to turn gay just to have something to do up here.  This is going to be huge.  But I'll be here for Stampede Week.  The Calgary Stampede.  You know how queer Calgary is?  I gave a girl $5.  I bought a cup of coffee at the airport.  She gave me freaking $7 and change.  I'm like, I like this town.  Yeah.  Jay, how's Kevin?  I'm so gay up here.  It's the gayest place I've ever been.  Oh, Jay, how's my buddy Kevin? 
[02:37:00]  No, I think the gayest place I've ever been is right here.  Oh, Jay, Kevin.  We have some more manly gifts.  Kevin.  Huh?  I got some gifts from Jay.  More manly, though.  A little beer and a little champagne for you.  Hey, thank you.  Ah, there you go.  So even when I'm in Calgary, I got the gorillas representing.  Yeah, Billy's in the studio helping us out.  Don't forget, last time Opie got drunk, he punched Paul Bond in the face.  Hey!  He might get drunk, and he might try to pile drive Marco. 
[02:37:30]  Marco would be shaking his little ass in front of Opie's head, and Opie would be like,  Oh, screw it.  Oh, you're very naughty.  Marco, I think you can put your clothes back on.  Oh, of course.  I think Joe is going to go.  Marco, come here.  You've got to come in this room and fill out some paperwork.  Of course, the beer that Marco brought were hineys.  Dude, I got some Corona and limes.  That is, now that's a gift.  Thank you.  We've got a case for Anthony.  Ah, ho.  That's not Anthony's name.  Ah, ho.  Case of blood. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, Mindy.  How would you like to mow my lawns?  Huh?  Ah, ho, ho, Danny.  Couldn't find any...  So, Jay, when are we going to see you again?  Cool.  Not until, like, August, man.  I'm up here forever.  Bravo.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm in training.  I do full-frontal nudity in the movie.  Get out of here.  Yeah, I show my junk.  What?  What?  I got velvet.  Whatever.  Yeah, I was just going to say.  I was going to say, we've all seen your junk.  Did they put you in front of a big black hooker? 
[02:38:30]  She was a hooker.  I just thought I was doing great with her.  But you saw the junk, so, you know, that's something you've got to get on screen.  We all saw the junk.  Can you imagine that on a 30-foot screen?  It would look like something was being attacked.  I told you, I'm sick.  The ugly sick.  Yeah, Marco's drooling right now as you're talking about your junk.  Oh, Marco.  Hey, Marco, why don't you give O.B. a massage for you?  Now, shut up.  Oh, shut up.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Whatever he wants.  Not in a gay way.  O.B., don't be gay-phobic. 
[02:39:00]  Whatever he wants.  Gay-phobic.  Shut up, Mr.  Shut up.  Shut up, Mr. Bullseye.  Wait, wait.  Marco's got a story about the bullseye that you put on his butt, Jay.  Three days after you did that, I forgot I had to go to the doctor's, and he asked for me to drop my pants, and I forgot that was on my butt.  You hadn't washed your ass in three days?  I didn't wash it, but it was a sharpie.  Oh, my God.  And the doctor started laughing, and I forgot it was on, and I was like, why is he laughing? 
[02:39:30]  Oh.  Must have looked like egg drop soup down there.  You don't have to puke inside your mouth and swallow it again?  Yeah.  I thought it was a burp, but Marco made me puke.  Yeah, Marco, something tells him, you better wash your ass on a daily basis.  And then the doctor took your temperature in your ass, but he had both his hands on your shoulders.  Marco, what kind of doctor do you go to?  I've been to...  No doctors.  I had to go...  I had to go...  No, come on.  You have to get your...  You have to go for 18 days.  That's the big thing now. 
[02:40:00]  It's his friend.  He calls him the doctor.  That's pretty much it.  I don't think there was any doctor involved.  What, like every time you go to the doctor, does it involve something where you have to  pull your pants down and you've got a lot of butt?  Marco goes in for his AGT and his protease inhibitors.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Yo, an FBA reference.  Jesus.  That's awful.  Wow.  Like, what are you doing?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  All right, people.  Marco is healthy as a horse, man. 
[02:40:30]  I am.  Yeah.  And I'm looking better, too.  But I was on Stacker 2.  You're using the Stacker 2?  I used it.  I lost 10 pounds.  Yeah.  Well, great.  You know, now you're going to hurt me if you promote it, Marco.  No.  Yeah, the gay Stacker 2.  Weight loss company of gay Marco.  It was easy.  I just took a Stacker 2 and had nothing but pure protein throughout the day.  Exactly.  You're going to be having a bad month.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  You know, stay right up here, you guys, until like 11 o'clock at night. 
[02:41:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Where are you?  The Arctic Circle?  Yeah, pretty much, man.  Yeah, you see any of that Aurora Borealis?  She was here.  Yeah.  My wife's in, like, Antigua, so it's just like Whore Central.  Oh, my God.  I can only imagine what epic Eureka in Canada.  No one has ever seen this wife of yours.  I'm right here.  Hey!  All right.  Who's practicing my wife? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah, she's hot.  She's hot?  Really, yeah.  Yep.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why are you still naked, Marco?  Marco's like Pinocchio.  I'd like to be naked.  He's naked.  He's junker than us.  No, he's wearing those shorts again.  He's got Pinocchio pants here.  Marco, show Opie your little triangle pee-pee.  No, no, Jake.  No.  Oh, my God, Jake.  He takes the girl hormones, and it makes his pee-pee like a little triangle.  How do you know?  Yeah, how do you know all that? 
[02:42:00]  How do you know, Jake?  I'm going to pick out a joke.  Jake.  I'm the only guy that ever drove down 43 and 11 pants idol-wise and went,  Hey, look at her, him.  Like, get in the car, take your chunk out, keep your mouth shut.  I mean, keep it up.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, we can all relate, Jake.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Sure, yeah.  Not a coincidence.  You're even talking about that.  It just happened to me last night.  Amazing.  Sometimes you can't help it to get in the car.  You know, it's like, whatever. 
[02:42:30]  All right, get going.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  I mean, they're going to leave as soon as they're done.  He's not kidding.  He sees gay people.  He sees gay people.  What would be all of you today?  48.  You look great.  Just kill yourself now, pal.  Goddamn.  Opa Precious, how old are you?  I can't believe you're 30-something.  I can't believe you did that. 
[02:43:00]  I can be part of that 30-something.  Are you a broad?  TV show.  I'm as old as you.  How old are you?  29.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  You're full of baloney.  You're full of Marco.  All right, I got two.  You're full of Marco's spunk.  Dude, I never touched Marco like you did.  I whipped him and beat him.  You beat him?  You put a bullseye in his hairy man-ass?  But Opie and I kissed.  We did not kiss.  I never kissed him.  Hey, Marco, why did you have your face blacked out on the website? 
[02:43:30]  If you're going to be queer, let the whole world know it.  Ed, save my ass at this point.  I don't want to go near any asses.  There's no asses I'm going near at this point.  No, we were taking a picture out front.  Right when the flash went off, Marco leaned over like he was going to kiss Opie.  Oh, you did kiss me.  That's right.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Marco, on the website, when you see the pictures of you and Opie making out...  Shut up.  Why?  No.  I'm going to saw it.  We didn't make out.  Whatever. 
[02:44:00]  He kissed my cheek really fast.  How come there's a black dot over your face, Marco?  You don't want anybody to know you're gay?  You're gay, Marco.  There's people I work with who don't know I'm gay.  Who doesn't know you're gay?  Oh, my God.  That's like Ving Rhames going.  He goes into work and people don't know he's black.  Come on.  Some people still don't know I'm black.  You're funny.  You.  Anthony, you have a problem with gay Marco?  Yeah, his pics are like running down the side of the seat. 
[02:44:30]  I'm sweating.  He's hot because he's talking to me.  He likes you.  No, he likes Jay.  At least that's the only bodily fluid he's secreting in here.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know about that guy.  What about Psycho Mark?  He's like a complete racist and homophobe.  If you watch him and Marco in a room, that would be an interesting fight.  He'd be happy to hear you call him that.  All right.  I think we've got to move on.  Yeah, please.  Hey, Jay, have fun up there.  I would like the listeners to know it was a coincidence that they brought the gay stuff out. 
[02:45:00]  I was talking about whores and drugs and getting bloated up in Calgary.  What movie are you filming, Jay?  The Bill Murray one?  Yeah, it's called Speaking of Sex.  Very nice.  You're like filming three movies or something?  Yeah, I'm on fire right now.  I can be honest with you.  I'm usually a humble guy, but Jesus, I am on fire.  I mean, there's just no doubt in it.  Between rascals and the movies, it is over.  You're a humble guy.  Yeah.  You've got to buy out the Verona Inn.  There you go. 
[02:45:30]  Cash cow.  Yeah, yeah.  Farmer.  Verona.  Big farmer.  Big farmer in Verona.  Okay?  I'm making a gay piece of personal.  I can put my hands in my pockets when I'm naked.  All right, Jay.  I love you guys.  Opie, happy birthday.  Thanks.  Anthony, when is your birthday?  It was in April.  Remember, you called for that one too.  That was when Dice was on the phone with you.  That was during the NyQuil.  Yeah.  That was during the NyQuil belt.  Yes, of course. 
[02:46:00]  Don't be a stranger and let's go next, man.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  I'm holding a flag and they're going crazy.  Oh, is that what that was?  Boy, that is the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  Opie holding a gay flag.  Jay Moore has gone, Anthony.  Yes.  All right.  Happy birthday.  All right.  Jeff Norris, what's up?  Let me get the game.  Okay, what's up, though?  Hey. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, man, we're packed over here.  We got one nice blonde showing us our fun bags, giving out some stickers, and we got  a little message for you there from all the fellas out here outside of GameStop.  You want to hear it?  No, but go ahead.  Hold on.  One, two, three.  Happy birthday, man.  Hallelujah, baby.  All right.  Welcome to the road show, too.  All right, cool.  Thanks, buddy.  We'll be here for a while.  All right, man.  All right.  There they are.  Send some women down.  You got it. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  Good luck.  They're giving out WOW stickers at GameStop?  GameStop.  GameStop located on Route 22 East in Union, New Jersey, across from Coconut's music, Anthony.  Jeff Morris and Big Cab and the gang down there handing out the brand new WOW stickers,  okay?  Mm-hmm.  Well, we got to thank Mark.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Is it Mark?  Your name's not Marco.  What's your name?  It's Marco.  It's Marco. 
[02:47:30]  Marco.  Hey.  Hey.  Give us a hey.  Wait a minute.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  It's the same damn thing.  Because it's him.  Hey.  Hey.  He's got to give us a new one.  What can you say?  I'll say whatever you want me to say.  Oh, my bad.  Get lost?  Actually, I want to say hello to Sexy Mike, who I met at Sean and Jennifer's wedding this 
[02:48:00]  weekend.  And he didn't believe that I was...  Sean and Wendy's, please.  But I didn't...  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Sean and Wendy's wedding.  And he was really sexy to be straight, though.  But, you know...  Oh, damn.  You can convert him, right?  Just give him a six-pack of Heineken.  Of course.  Give him a couple of magic words.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  You know it?  A six-pack of Heineken and a bottle of Annalise.  That must just kill you, right?  You see a good-looking guy, you think he's good-looking, and he's straight.  Like, oh, what a waste.  What a waste. 
[02:48:30]  Waste of a good, hairy butt.  Hey.  Hey.  Are we done with this segment, Anthony?  I hope so.  Well, Marco, thanks for coming.  Oh, thank you.  It was a pleasure.  Yeah, I'm going to...  No, no, no, no, no.  He can stay right where he is.  I love this little scooter.  Don't you hate when Rick does that to you?  Rick will hug, too.  No.  Hug him.  Hug him.  God damn it.  Kiss him.  Yeah, I hope he's running.  See, Opie is now leaving the room.  I understand. 
[02:49:00]  Opie, I understand completely.  And I want it known.  He's gone.  And I knew nothing about this.  Opie's left the studio.  He won't return until J. Marco is out of the studio.  Rick pulls this crap all the time, though.  I mean, you know what?  I think it's partly Opie's fault, because he wasn't as vocal as I am when it comes to  surprises on this show.  Every two seconds, I'm going, dude, I do not want this happening or this or that.  Opie wasn't as vocal.  The only thing he told me was no strippers.  What?  The only thing he told me was no strippers. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, well.  Oops.  I did nothing.  I did nothing.  All right.  Well, I guess Opie left.  I brought a bottle of wine.  That was it.  We got...  What?  Yeah, he left.  Opie left the studio.  We'll take a break.  I'll see if we can dig him off.  I don't know.  Wah, wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.

I want my old crappy eyesight back.  I don't need crystal clear vision for today.  I saw hairy nipples on a girl that has a .32-8 chest. 
[02:52:00]  Gay guy was hitting on me.  No, I should say Jay Moore's boyfriend was hitting on me.  Jay Moore's boyfriend.  You hear Jay backpedaling all the time?  Yeah, I'm a bag basher now.

You've got to read it.  I'm going to read it later.  There's like a ton of people, everyone from the show signed a big, huge card in.  Yes.  You got the big, huge card signed by everybody.  Thank you.  And a cake.  A very, very different thing than to happen on a birthday. 
[02:54:00]  And you guys know how to spell.  Great.  Thank you.  I hope he's getting fed by the girl.  Girl put a little cream on her nippy.  If I do that, I'm going to have a really bad birthday.  Yeah, really.  Thank you.  Wow.  That was very nice.  Good enough for me. 
[02:54:30]  Hey, did I hear one of these girls wants to play a game?  Really?  Really?  Here, girls.  Hold on down.  Girls, get on that mic.  Please.  We want to talk to you on the radio.  The lovely girls from Privilege.  They're funny.  Are you talking French?  Do they speak English?  They don't speak English?  They don't speak English.  Who doesn't speak English?  Do you speak English?  Do you speak French?  Do you speak French?  Oh, my God.  A frog. 
[02:55:00]  Have my mic, sure.  Say something in French.  What?  Say something in French.  Surrender.  How do you say very large carrot in French?  Will you speak French?  Do you speak French with me?  Wow.  They don't even speak English, Anthony.  What a surprise.  Will you sleep with me tonight?  Yeah.  Say, welcome, German army.  Take whatever you need.  What?  Ah, yes. 
[02:55:30]  Wow, French, huh?  How about that?  They make those in France, too, huh?  Yeah, look at those cans.  Do they want to try to win Stockbroker Dave's money?  Is someone saying yes?  Oh, no.  No?  Who?  They want me to pee in a bottle.  What?  They ain't paying for that.  What is that?  It's not a drug test going on here.  They told me to pee in a bottle.  We don't care what you do.  I told him I had to go to the bathroom, and he told me to pee in a bottle. 
[02:56:00]  Who told you that?  Kevin told me to pee in a bottle.  Spaz?  Kevin told me to pee.  I told him I had to pee in a bottle.  Why would we want to see that?  And he said pee in a bottle.  Interesting.  All right.  And he said the carrots with my hood ring.  That's an ocean tattoo.  Yeah.  You like my tattoo?  We want to do the cucumber.  You want to do the cucumber?  She wants to do the cucumber.  We don't have a cucumber.  We have carrots.  We have the world's largest carrot. 
[02:56:30]  We have carrots and bananas.  It's the front ship.  Julia Jones.  All right.  Wait.  Let me set up the festivities here, okay?  I have bananas.  How about a protein bar?  Do we got a protein bar?  Right.  Oh!  All right.  That's Stockbroker Dave, ladies.  Hi.  Hi, Stockbroker.  Show them your wad of cash.  Yes.  Stockbroker Dave.  This guy's right off of Wall Street.  Look at that.  What do we get?  Oh, my God.  Do you get carrots?  I like bananas.  I like bananas. 
[02:57:00]  You know, Anthony, believe me, you can just step back.  We want the bananas.  We want the bananas.  We want the bananas.  You want the banana?  We want the banana.  All right.  All right.  These girls are completely naked from privilege.  Beautiful.  Do you all?  One speaks English.  She wants it hard.  She wants a hard banana.  A little bit.  Oh.  All right.  Well, we want a plantain.  All right.  Hold on.  So what are we going to do, Dave?  I don't know.  It's your birthday, bud.  Yeah, but it's your bankroll.  It's your bankroll. 
[02:57:30]  So let's see.  I'm buying for my friends.  Ladies, do you think you could actually make that banana disappear?  I didn't think you were going to do some kind of a David Copperfield act, and all of a  it would just vanish, I think we all know where it would end up.  Oh, my God.  But who wants to take on the world's largest carrot?  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  They're saying no, no to the world's largest carrot, Anthony. 
[02:58:00]  The carrot.  No, no.  No takers on the world's largest carrot?  All right.  We got 100 bucks for the carrot.  For the carrot.  David.  I'm with you.  So I'm going to wash it.  Three.  Three for three.  No, no.  Three carrots.  One carrot.  Oh, brother.  One carrot.  Where's my carrot?  All right.  All right.  They're taking a look at the world's largest carrot. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  What do we do with the carrot?  Come here.  Okay.  Okay.  You're working.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Should we wash the carrot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wash that carrot.  Wash that carrot.  Wash that carrot.  All right.  It's a possibility.  The world's largest carrot has left the studio to get washed.  It's amazing what happens when Dave brings out his bankroll.  The vegetables were one thing. 
[02:59:00]  Those came out and the girl's like, I don't know about that.  But then Ben Franklin shows his face and it all of a sudden becomes possible, doesn't it?  Look at the light on you.  Yeah, that's great.  Oh, my God.  What did you short?  What did you say?  Yeah.  You know?  All right.  We have to see four.  Wow.  Now they're negotiating.  I have to see some carrot insertion.  Four.  She's the barcode.  Yeah.  You got to warm up. 
[02:59:30]  You got to warm up with a banana.  Oh, there's four.  Another country's been heard from.  Four.  Four.  Four hundred.  Wow.  They're negotiating here.  Hey, what's going on, Dave?  What's going on?  Uh, I'm seeing, I'm seeing four hundred bucks laid out on the counter.  For the carrot?  We, we, we said five.  Five?  Five?  Five.  No, you said four.  You said four.  Four.  Wait a minute.  I don't, I like quibbling or anything, but, you know. 
[03:00:00]  Man, she doesn't speak English, but she knows money.  See, you know what happened?  The four came out too easy.  Four hundred dollars.  Got a bottle of five.  Four hundred dollars.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Okay, hold on.  Stockbroker Dave said, my boy's negotiating for me over here.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Wait, send me in.  Hold on.  Anthony.  Yes.  Wait a second.  Stockbroker Dave said.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Is the carrot clean?  Yes, yes.  Is the carrot clean? 
[03:00:30]  Please hold.  The world's largest carrot is clean.  Stockbroker Dave said he will go to five, five, but it would include not only the carrot  going through, as they say in the household terms, the front door,  but also something going into the guest entrance, if you know what I mean.  No, no, no, no.  Maybe an asparagus spear?  No.  Maybe a grape?  Maybe a grape?  Maybe a grape? 
[03:01:00]  Maybe a baby carrot.  A baby carrot.  I can do the carrot.  You can do the carrot.  Wait, but how much of that, though, Ant?  I can do the carrot.  How much?  Wait, someone's got to choose that word.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Time out.  Time out.  Time out.  Time out.  Just the carrot?  No, wait.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  All right, Opie.  Opie, let Opie speak.  Yeah, Steve's got a great idea on line, too.  Steve.  Yeah.  All right, what's your idea?  You knock the carrot in increments about approximately two inches, and each increment is marked with  a hundred bucks.  I like it. 
[03:01:30]  That's good.  All right.  Okay, that will guarantee that we get an adequate...  I like your thinking, Doug.  All right, we like that idea, Steve.  All right.  All right, here's the deal.  You have to reach the $400 mark on the carrot.  Wait.  Is that accurate?  Get a ruler.  That's pretty good.  It's going to be dirty.  Hey, it'll dry.  Ooh, you dirty little carrot.  What about your little lights, Rick?  Johnny, you want homes?  We'll cut it with a knife.  All right, so we're going for what?  A hundred dollars per two inches.  Per two inches.  Opie, I might have to go to a remote mic for this portion of the program. 
[03:02:00]  Okay.  Would you like a chair, sir?  Now, are we measuring this accurately?  Let me see.  Let me see the world's largest carrot.  Man, you could go home with a lot of cake here.  Let me see.  Okay.  Opie, I'm on location now.  All right.  Here.  One, two, three.  That's the $400 mark?  $400 mark.  All right.  That would be, that's the $500 mark right there.  Wow.  There is a $500 mark. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  That's good.  Wow.  Wait, Dave, are you okay with this?  Opie, are you okay with it?  I'm okay with it.  I'm okay with it.  Win stockbroker Dave's money.  Yes.  Let's get a good shot of the carrot in question.  Wow.  Five bills?  Five bills.  The $500 mark.  Wait, who's putting this in?  Uh, yep.  I think the birthday boy.  Oh, no, no, no. 
[03:03:00]  I'll help you.  It's got to be done slowly.  I'll do it.  Do it slowly.  All right.  My boy Tommy over here.  Tommy?  You don't want to hurt the girl.  Tommy?  Tommy.  Oh, girl.  Oh, no, someone will appreciate it.  Come on.  Go ahead.  What?  A little lightless?  Yeah.  Get the lady friend to do it there, okay?  All right, Anthony.  Well, I don't have a good view anymore.  Oh, there we go.  Okay.  Don't say what is going on.  Yeah.  I think everyone can figure that out.  We're just going to make the carrot disappear.  What's going on, Andy? 
[03:03:30]  Uh, slowly.  Okay.  Uh, Opie, we have reached $100.  All right.  We have reached the $100 mark.  Oh, that's two.  We're going...  Not yet.  I'm looking.  There's two.  We're at the $200 mark.  And we don't see any grimace of pain or anything yet.  Don't worry if you have to...  There's three.  Oh, good.  That's three.  Don't worry if you have to pull back to the $200 mark and then go back for four.  That's fine. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, why don't you work that thing a little bit?  Not like, oh, my God.  Wow, she spun it into the $400 mark.  Are we done?  Wait, move that hand.  Let me see.  Move that hand.  Yeah, they're at the four.  You're at the four.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Five.  Four.  Five hundred dollars.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Rick, look at this break. 
[03:04:30]  Wow.  Who's looking at it?  Who's eating the carrot?  All right.  Who's eating the carrot?  Oh, my God.  Put that in a Ziploc bag and it gets auctioned off at the Roadshow Thursday.  Wow.  Yeah, save the world's largest carrot for the Roadshow.  Rick's handling it like it's nuclear waste.  It could be.  Whoa, man.  Wow.  Hey, Psycho Mark, you get that?  Huh?  You get that?  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  Good.  All right.  Look at that.  They're wrapping it up like it's evidence.  Whoa.  Wow.  Dude, did you ever think she'd reach the 500 mark?  No.  Hey, Grandma, I brought you a carrot.  Do I get a clap?  Do I get a clap?  I don't know.  Do you get the clap?  Not from a carrot.  Very nice.  What's your name?  I think she dates Blackbats.  Madison.  Madison, what could you do with grapes?  What could you do with grapes?  What could you do with grapes? 
[03:05:30]  What could you do with grapes?  How about a delicious apple?  You got more money left over after that, Dave?  Oh, I got more money.  We're in the wrong business, Ed.  I know.  That's like a week's pay for him.  I didn't even know it was your birthday.  Man.  Man.  Win stockbroker Dave's money.  See?  Try what?  I told you she's the one that's bargaining the whole time.  She wants to do the same thing.  Man, we saw that already.  Dave shorted all the tech stocks in the middle of March.  Try a banana, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  All right, listen.  Try a banana.  All right, Ed.  Know what we'll do?  Yeah.  Let the girls negotiate with Stockbroker Dave.  We're in the middle of playing.  Win Stockbroker Dave's money.  We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back to finish up the show, okay?  Okay.  Stay there.  It's a Kevlar candidate, 1027 WNEW.  He's from Privilege, Gentleman's Club, West 23rd Street and 11th Avenue. 
[03:06:30]  They're negotiating right now with Stockbroker Dave.  Another round of Win Stockbroker Dave's money about to happen.  They're talking about the asparagus right now.  Yeah, I don't know.  There seems to be a little negotiating going as far as what asparagus is worth.  Huh?  Well, no, you negotiate with the ladies.  We're actually in the middle of a commercial still, so I'll see whatever you pull off, trust me.  I'm fine with whatever you decide.  All right, Dave, get over there and negotiate, Ed and I got to finish this.  What? 
[03:07:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  All right.  We got to dump out.  You can't really say what's going to go on.  Hold on, let me tell you what goes on here.  Yeah.  Listen, yeah.  All right, Dave.  Dave's negotiated, let's just put it that way.  Oh, my God.  You can't say that either.  Dave, leave the description to us.  Yes, we're professionals.  You supply the cash, we'll supply the description.  That's right.  It has something to do with an asparagus.  We'll play Win Stockbroker Dave's money in just a second here.

[03:09:00]  We're coming back in a couple minutes with Wynn, stockbroker Dave's Money.  Stay there.  Do you want a little dose of honesty?  You'll find it here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a couple of idiots.  Filthy, disgusting, greased idiots.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, man, just about done.  We have one more thing to do here.  We do want to thank the fine ladies of Privilege. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Kevin's Club, West 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  We're down there live, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Well, we haven't been there since our ratings party, but we'll be back soon.  We've got some very lovely ladies in the studio right now, and they're trying to win stockbroker Dave's Money.  And Dave is holding up an asparagus.  Dave, let Anthony explain what's going on.  Now, have we negotiated the price of the asparagus?  Is it going to be incremental once again? 
[03:10:00]  Just one quick shot.  One quick shot of asparagus for...  Okay.  We had to dump out of that, but I'll explain for the listeners.  Where stockbroker Dave would like to see her place the asparagus, nothing has ever been placed there before.  Yes.  So she is saying that that is a sensitive issue, I guess.  Well, the balloon is very tight. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  Okay.  Very...  We do have some...  Hold that up.  We have something.  It's sealed.  It is a form of lubricant.  If that would be okay, maybe help you out a little bit.  Oh, God.  Prison loop.  That's a prison loop.  That's a prison loop.  That's a prison loop.  But I guess stockbroker Dave is saying one Ben Franklin for a quick shot. 
[03:11:00]  I guess up to the first little branch that it has on it there.  That's where all the vitamins are.  Yeah.  And it's not cooked, so it still has all the minerals that a growing girl needs.  Are you putting it there?  No.  No.  No, but the birthday boy has to see it.  Yeah, I'll be able to see that.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, have one of the girls look.  Yeah, she seems to be helping out a lot.  Oh, and you're going to use some of that.  She's picking up the prison loop. 
[03:11:30]  The prison loop.  Well, Opie, once again, I'm going to have to move to another location.  Sure.  Remote location.  All right, I'll just, I'll move over there.  Oh, my God.  Opie, I'm on scene once again for this.  She's putting the prison lube.  I might go over there.  This one.  Dave, move over.  If you want to talk, move over.  This isn't even going to help that much, but okay. 
[03:12:00]  I'm on scene, too, Anthony.  Okay, very good.  Ah, yes.  There you go.  Okay.  That's how to cook some asparagus.  Remember, kids, eat your veggies.  Now, wait a minute.  No one can see it like that.  Over the chair.  Hey, hold on.  Hold on the other way.  Over the chair.  Yeah, turn around that way.  No, no.  So you're facing, well, not facing, no.  So you're facing the CDs.  There we go.  Okay.  Now, wheel out toward the CDs a little more. 
[03:12:30]  Okay.  That's a bird's eye view.  There we go.  Oh, my gosh.  Whoa.  All right.  Supplying some, uh...  Yeah, well...  Yeah.  Okay.  Prison stuff.  Okay.  Here we go.  And...  Oh, my gosh.  Whoa.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh.  Hey, how is that?  Hello.  Hey, how is that?  Okay, terrific. 
[03:13:00]  Wow.  Holy...  Somehow, I got the feeling she's done that before.  She says she hasn't.  I'm speechless.  How was that?  First time ever, huh?  Cute.  How was that?  First time?  For the first time in the asparagus?  Yeah.  Very lovely.  It was?  Marco could have gave you some tips on that one.  Okay.  Okay, terrific. 
[03:13:30]  Only Marco uses cord lumber.  It's amazing.  Pre-split.  Zucchini, whatever he has around.  Well, I'm speechless.  Wow.  Hope our last item up for auction is the bignana.  The bignana.  We're just trying to help the kids.  Eat your vegetables, kids, out there.  Okay?  It's a public service thing.  Yes.  Yes.  Eat your veggies.  I think one of our listeners, actually, Vinny, sent in a suggestion.  How about two girls, one banana? 
[03:14:00]  Hmm.  That seems legit.  Girls, we're not talking about where the asparagus just went.  These are the two girls who have not done anything yet.  Ah.  Yes.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Banana's easy.  Oui, oui.  All right, the French girls are talking about.  Banana's easy there, Frenchie.  A hundred each.  Oui, oui.  What?  A hundred each?  Banana's easy.  Comprende?  She wants 500.  No, it's a banana. 
[03:14:30]  It's a banana.  It's not like it was the carrot for distance.  You're talking one banana, two girls.  You're talking maybe, like, two, three inches most.  She said everyone 500.  No, it can't.  She's not old.  No.  We can't.  We can't.  No, you know.  No.  I will not have my client taken advantage of it.  Yeah, Dave's not that easy.  You know why? 
[03:15:00]  Stop chewing me down.  Hey, I'm Jewish.  I can say that.  You know what?  It goes on a degree of difficulty.  So when you have a carrot going, that carrot is huge.  That's worth 500.  The world's largest carrot.  World's.  You know?  Yeah, see?  It's like the United Nations of smut in here today.  We need translators.  Bye, guys.  Happy birthday.  You're taking off?  Yeah, I'm leaving.  All right.  Thank you.  Wow.  I have to go clean myself.  Yeah, go clean up. 
[03:15:30]  That's okay.  Happy birthday.  Thank you for winning Stock Broker Dave's money.  Winning Stock Broker Dave's money.  Anthony, actually, I think we've got to wrap this up.  Thank you for unvaganizing me.  My pleasure, man.  Oh, my God.  I don't think I'll ever eat asparagus again.  That's good.  You broke me of that habit, Dave.  Thank you.  How about that?  Let's hear it for all the ladies from Privilege.  Wonderful ladies.  Wonderful.  West 23rd Street and 11th Avenue.  Lovely ladies, too.  Two of them don't even speak English today. 
[03:16:00]  Those two didn't want any part of the banana thing.  Dave, I'm glad.  I'm proud of you.  You held the ground, Dave.  You still gave up, what, 600 today?  That's one of the things they teach us on the floor.  Dave.  How did trade asparagus?  The asparagus thing, though?  The asparagus thing?  That was pretty cool.  That was cool.  We got that cheap.  Yeah.  That was cheap, yeah.  That was cheap, eh?  That was a bargain.  Yeah, we were willing to pay two.  She'd be a terrible floor trader.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Terrible floor trader.  Willing to go for two.  She went for the one.  We'll give you 200. 
[03:16:30]  No, just give me one.  And that wasn't even incremental.  Like, the guy that was applying the asparagus kind of went a lot further with it than, no,  that isn't the one, is it?  Psycho Mark smelling a stalk of asparagus.  All right, Jesus.  All right, man.  Put that in a bag for the road show.  Yeah, put the other one in a bag for the road show.  You know, the noise that is going to be made when we pull out the world's largest carrot  at the road show Thursday, people are going to just lose it.  Just going to hear, ooh.  We're going to auction it off live at the road show, and we'll get some of your money back,  Dave, so you can come in and play more of where you give the charity. 
[03:17:00]  Watch out for Dave's money.  We've got to get out of here.  All right, we're just about out of time, but one last thing.  Real quick, Sandy has for us.  My lovely girlfriend.  Yeah.  We brought in gay guys and stalkers.  Gay guys and stalkers.  All right.  She's got a big bag.  The reason why I'm doing this on the air is because it's related, so.  Okay.  It's related to the asparagus thing?  Oh, I was going to say. 
[03:17:30]  You want to bring some asparagus to the hotel room tonight, sweetie?  Whoa.  Oh, whoa.  What do you got there?  This rocks.  I knew she was up to something.  What the hell is that?  It's like the strap-on.  Darren's making a cover, but.  All right.  Dude, it's like.  She made you a strap-on.  It's like every single newspaper article of our little careers.  Oh, my God. 
[03:18:00]  In a huge scrapbook.  Look at that.  Dating back to when I wasn't even with the opster, probably.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah, the old days.  You're in the paper this many times?  Oh, yes.  All right, I want to read that now.  Wow.  Look at that.  Ah, remember that?  That one.  See, and remember that one?  No charges were actually filed.  And then that one, they couldn't use the word convicted.  Wow, this is awesome.  Okay.  The listeners can't relate, but.  Cool. 
[03:18:30]  It's every article.  It's our, yeah, it's our career in the news.  Something great.  And, of course, the Friday morning quarterback.  Ah, the nude pics.  Oh, thank you, States.  You're welcome, Opie.  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.  No, my lovely girlfriend.  Thank you, Sandy.  That rocks.  Huh?  What about the strap-on?  Easy.  Psycho Mark.  You will get punched.  Well, happy birthday, pal.  Thank you. 
[03:19:00]  Another year of misery down the tube.  I got to admit, this was a lot of fun.  I wasn't going to come in today because I was under the weather, but I had a really good time.  Yeah, it was fun.  I want to thank everyone who stopped by.  I want to thank Rick.  You put the whole damn thing together.  Good job.  Did a great job with that.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  That's the final surprise.  Rick wrapped your car in newspaper.  All right.  We got to get out of here.  Dynamike are next.  We'll see you guys tomorrow for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[03:19:30]  Yes.  Cool.  Get your wows on your car.  More surprises on the way tomorrow about the road show that's happening Thursday.  New things being added by the second.  Yeah, don't forget Thursday.  The road show starts at 2.  Doors open at 2, I should say.  21 or older.  No cover charge.  We're all going to be partying at the South Beach Dance Club, 50 Broadway, Island Park.  Dave, you coming?  No.  Going to Mexico tomorrow morning.  Ah, look at you, Jet Setter.  Anniversary.  Yeah.  All right.  That's cool.  But we will bring the world's largest carrot in your honor, Dave.  Yes.  Thank you.  All right.  People are going to howl when they see the size of it. 
[03:20:00]  You're not going to believe the size of that carrot.  I can't wait to see the smell of it.  We got to make a trophy out of that.  All right, guys.  Thank you very much.  We'll see you tomorrow, too.  Call system, go over.  Until you have any self-respect, aren't you embarrassed for yourself, for your family?  Hope you have answered today.  You live human slime!  1027-WNEW. </pre>
