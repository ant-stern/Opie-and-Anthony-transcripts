<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts’ characteristically vulgar and self-deprecating introductions, introducing their crew, including Hurricane Ben and Martini Steve.  They immediately launched into a discussion about Jersey City Mayor Jeremiah Healy's altercation with Bradley Beach police after intervening in his sister's bar fight.  News reports and Healy's account were played, followed by analysis from the hosts and former police officer Kenny, who speculated on the mayor's culpability.  A caller, Randy, offered a local perspective, suggesting overzealous policing.

The show then shifted to a detailed recounting of an incident from the previous Friday.  A confrontation occurred during the hosts' post-show walk to the XM studios, involving an unnamed individual.  This led to a barrage of emails and calls from XM management, which the hosts described as overwhelmingly frustrating and filled with absurd requests.  They voiced their annoyance with their manager, Elo, for his vague and unhelpful communication.  The hosts described the confrontation in detail, revealing it involved a fan with a lisp and another uninvited individual, and highlighted XM's attempts to suppress the audio. They also criticized XM's poor handling of their publicity photos.

A subsequent segment focused on a Howard Stern fan who disrupted the live broadcast, initially verbally assaulting the hosts by calling them "douchebags" and accusing them of stealing from Stern.  This escalated when the fan, feeling humiliated by the audience's laughter, physically assaulted producer Ben. Security, including someone named Poe, intervened.  Opie and Anthony reacted on air, with Anthony using an “obnoxious laugh” and Opie later reprimanding the fan. The hosts extensively discussed the fan's poor planning and execution, contrasting him with more creative Stern fans.  They noted the audio circulating online and XM's removal of it from replays. The segment concluded with discussions of their upcoming comedy tour, E-Rock’s sunburn, a funny anecdote about sunscreen application, Phil Mickelson's US Open performance, a Tiger Woods sighting, and their frustration with lawyers only allowing a heavily edited version of the fan altercation audio to air.  In-studio guests included Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and E-Rock.

A significant portion of the broadcast centered around a previous broadcast incident—described as one of the biggest in the last two years—for which only a heavily edited version of the audio was permitted by their lawyers, much to the hosts' anger and frustration. A caller, Neil from New York, called in with a heavily accented English discussion of the World Cup, which amused the hosts.  A "Homeless Radio" segment featured Tibby Tom, a homeless, gay man with AIDS, discussing gay marriage.  The death of a woman who fell from a cliff while taking a photo in Yellowstone was also discussed as an example of needless risk-taking.  Opie expressed anger at his staff’s performance and requests for raises, threatening firings.  Ben’s early departure due to anxiety over the "walk-over" segment, during which the Friday altercation occurred, was also discussed.

Opie's frustration with his staff's performance continued, culminating in a heated exchange with a caller, Paul, about Paul's dishonesty. Opie admitted to being a “crybaby” on air but defended his commitment to honesty.  The handling of audio clips by staff and lawyers was heavily criticized, particularly the censorship of the word "cock," leading to humorous anecdotes. Opie also detailed the "Daily Dump Report," outlining removed segments.  The segment included tangents on Jimmy Norton's flatulence, the show's increased ratings, recollections of past radio shows and rock bands (David Lee Roth and Blue Oyster Cult), and a bus accident involving Special Olympics athletes.  Sandy Kane and James Brown made brief appearances.  The segment ended with a Stephen Lynch song.

A later segment began with discussions of their upcoming tour, including a gig with Blue Oyster Cult, and a critique of David Lee Roth's current vocal abilities compared to Sammy Hagar’s. Callers debated Roth's current performance quality.  Updates on ticket sales for their “Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus” tour were given by Pete Pappalardo and Jeff Gordon, showing strong sales.  The conversation then shifted to a poorly received Wawa commercial, Jimmy Norton's appearance on *Lucky Louie*, Jay-Z's Cristal boycott, Puff Daddy's career, Biggie Smalls, and a video of a school bus altercation.  The segment concluded with heated phone calls, including one from "Black Guy in Connecticut" who launched a racially charged personal attack on Jimmy Norton and *Lucky Louie*, followed by further discussion of the Cristal boycott and angry listener calls.  The show concluded with the "walk-over" segment, featuring interactions with several individuals, including a man with a large Opie and Anthony subway advertisement sign and a man who engaged them in a religious discussion, ending with the religious man declaring the interaction "all of Satan".  Opie concluded the broadcast with further expressions of anger towards his staff.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.D. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.D., Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Right off!  O.D. and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poop that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No. 
[00:01:00]  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you? 
[00:01:30]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Don't shoot your ass!  Don't!  Don't!  Don't!  It's impossible!  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want for tears to come out of my eyes?  We're cake production!  You're just a tool. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning!  Hi, everybody.  Hello.  Welcome.  And welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Next Monday, I believe we add WJFK in Washington, D.C., right?  Thank God.  I believe it's next Monday.  Thank God we add something.  Getting tired of not growing.  I want growth.  I know it's out there, eagerly awaiting. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, we got a few more cities waiting.  Monkey wrenches keep getting thrown in.  And waiting and waiting and waiting, but they're waiting.  They're in a holding pattern still, right?  Yeah.  All right.  That's on hold.  Super Agent Bob Eatman is working on it very diligently.  But then monkey wrenches keep getting thrown in to take certain people off of getting us syndicated 
[00:03:00]  and putting them on ridiculous things.  We got to talk about the mayor later.  This mayor of some small Jersey town.  Yeah, he was at a bar in Bradley Beach and the cops tuned him up a little bit.  Their own mayor?  I think he's a mayor of some other town.  Like the next town over or something.  Look at this guy.  He's on TV with his awful hair.  He's just a wreck.  You can see the gravel marks where the cops just had their knee at the back of his neck.  That's wonderful.  His hair is all in disarray. 
[00:03:30]  He looks like that old senator with the really bad toupee.  Didn't that guy go to jail or something?  He looks like that guy.  His comb over isn't working for him.  And he was elected even though they had pictures of him nude and drunk on his front stoop.  On his front porch.  But he was elected mayor and then his sister runs some gin mill somewhere and he was there over the weekend and the cops were called for a disturbance.  And apparently the cops were trying to control the situation and the mayor there, because it was his sister's bar, was telling the cops, you know, it's my sister's bar. 
[00:04:00]  And I'm trying to keep this guy calm.  That's jumping on my sister's car.  So he tried calming that guy down and the cops told him, don't get involved.  We got this, you know, in hand.  And the guy wouldn't stop getting involved.  When the cops tell you to back off and don't get involved, back off and don't get involved.  Because it never makes the situation better. 
[00:04:30]  Unless you're a recognizable mayor.  Right.  Right.  Not mayor comb over mayor scab head.  No.  He's all banged up.  If you're the mayor of man town.  He's mayor Jeremiah Heavey.  Heavy.  He's the mayor of Jersey City.  Healy.  Healy.  I believe.  Yeah.  And where is he mayor of?  I don't know.  It's some small place.  Is it Jersey City?  Jersey City.  Okay. 
[00:05:00]  That's pretty big.  That's a little big.  Jersey City is a big city, yeah.  Well, we got the audio.  We weren't going to start with this, but we have it in front of us.  Here's the story.  Jersey's second largest city accuses the Bradley Beach Police Department of police brutality.  He says that one minute he's doing his civic duty, the next minute he and his wife are on the ground and he's handcuffed and maced.  Jersey City Mayor Jeremiah Healy is nursing straight from his head, hand, and knee after he claims cops down in Bradley Beach roughed up him and his wife.  Mayor Healy says he had just finished celebrating with family at his sister's bar and restaurant. 
[00:05:30]  He noticed a couple in the middle of a quarrel.  Healy says he went to tell a cop the fight wasn't the woman's fault.  The person that he was, I would say, yelling at, I said, officer, this girl was not involved in the incident to which they were responding.  But Healy claims the cop suddenly grabbed him by the arm, threw him to the ground, and put him in handcuffs.  Because he did what he did, and he's the one who shoved my wife.  He's the one who decided to lock me up and shove me on the ground. 
[00:06:00]  You know, everybody's cop story, when the cops work him over, now I'm sure there are just badass cops out there that just want to kick some ass.  It happens.  But how come every story of some innocent guy that is just trying to help is like, I just went up to the officer, I was explaining the situation, and the next thing I knew, I'm in handcuffs getting maced.  I've never seen that happen.  They make it sound like the officer just snapped and went crazy. 
[00:06:30]  I said, excuse me, officer, can I please give you some information?  He punched me in the face.  Yes, Kenny?  They're all choir boys after the fact.  Yeah, it's never like maybe he was a little, maybe, no, I don't know, I wasn't there.  But in a lot of situations that happen like this, maybe the guy's a little drunk, you know, maybe he's getting a little loud.  The situation itself is probably loud, so you've got to raise your voice, you're emotional, it's family that's involved in some way, shape, or form. 
[00:07:00]  You're trying to push your power as being a mayor or a fireman or some other thing where you feel maybe you should be due a little more than just the average Joe.  It's never just what they say it is where, excuse me, sir, I really like to help.  If I could maybe give you some words to let you know what's going on.  You know, it's, you put your hands on here one more time and I'm going to, and the cop's like, hey, back off, back off, back off. 
[00:07:30]  And they never back off until the neck, the knee is in the neck, the mace is in the face.  You know, Anthony, it's just amazing how extremely perceptive you are because you hit the nail right on the head.  Thank you, Kenny.  Yeah, Kenny was on the force for many, many years.  And it ends up like this.  The old taser. 
[00:08:00]  That's a woman getting tased.  All right, we got more audio from the story.  Then they got maced.  Healy says Mrs. Healy hurt her ankle and leg.  And Healy says while he was down on the ground, the cop who had put him in handcuffs asked another cop for mace and, yes, gave him a stinging spray in both eyes.  He's the one who maced me with both eyes after I was laying down, handcuffed with two officers on my back.  And that was just like a gratuitous nastiness. 
[00:08:30]  Bradley Beach police say they warned Healy in a statement they say in part, quote, Mr. Healy was advised that if he did not cease to involve himself, he would be placed under arrest.  Mr. Healy refused to move on and, as the officers proceeded, he resisted and became disorderly, end quote.  We tell all of our citizens in Jersey City to be helpful and cooperative with the police in any way you can.  And that's what I thought I was doing.  Healy was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.  Both charges carry fines of up to $2,000, as well as a possible six-month jail sentence. 
[00:09:00]  Healy plans to file a criminal complaint with the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, as well as a civil complaint against the officer.  Oh, boy.  It's going to be an interesting story.  I just can't imagine, you know, maybe I'm being naive, but I can't imagine this guy laying there in handcuffs and another cop going, you got some mace because I just want to spray some mace in this guy's face.  Yeah, let's add insult to injury here.  And if there's still cops on you, when you're cuffed, 90% of the time, 99% of the time, you're still somehow resisting. 
[00:09:30]  Just because you're cuffed doesn't mean you can't be kicking, trying to get up, trying to roll over, still being a problem to what the cops are trying to do there.  That's why I never understood.  Whatever they say, do it.  Because if you don't, regardless if they're good cops or bad cops, if you're not listening to them at that moment, bite your frigging tongue. 
[00:10:00]  Shove your pride down somewhere.  You feel that sting?  That's pride effing with you.  Don't let it get to you.  Listen to them.  Because in the end, the cops are going to win.  They're going to win at least that battle right there.  In that situation, they always win.  Maybe in the long run through courts and all the bull that comes after it, maybe you'll get something out of it.  But right then and there, at that moment, you don't win. 
[00:10:30]  The more you resist, the worse it's going to get.  You're going to get a beating.  You're going to get that knee on the back of your neck, which is just a nightmare.  You do not want that.  You're going to get maced.  Here comes the expert again.  Yes, Kenny?  My philosophy is it's better to have a strong mind than strong fists.  That was the most profound thing I've ever heard from him.  I was fortunate he thought of that after he retired.  One of these days, Kenny, a book, learn to read them, I mean. 
[00:11:00]  And then perhaps someday a writing would be, because I'm sure you have stories that I would just love to breeze through.  He's knocked out more teeth and cancer of the gums.  You don't leave marks.  No, no, no.  You don't leave anything behind.  All right. 
[00:11:30]  Let's say hi to Randy in Jersey.  Randy, what's up?  How you doing today, guys?  What's up, man?  I live right down the street from that place.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And chances are, he didn't do anything wrong.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a teeny tiny town, square mile.  And the boys on the floor just get a little overzealous sometimes.  Small town cops.  Sometimes the small town cops get a little overzealous.  Here comes the expert. 
[00:12:00]  Once again.  They shot some homeless guy last year.  They shot a homeless guy last year?  Just to watch him die.  Right.  No, the shore cops, they don't play because they have 10 months of monotony to make up  for.  So in the two months of action.  Bradley Beach is not.  When was the last time you heard of Bradley Beach?  Never.  Never.  See, I rest my case.  That's why.  So when something happens, these guys go at it and then they have to sit through 10 months  and nothing.  Right. 
[00:12:30]  We don't get a lot of tourists in Bradley.  They all go to Balmar.  All right.  Thanks, Randy.  It's just a small town, whatever.  All right.  Well, that's a developing story this morning.  Did he tell me he was the mayor of Jersey City?  That probably was the first thing out of his mouth.  But I'm a mayor.  But I'm a...  Ow!  You know what that's all about?  Ah, Kenny's laughing.  You know what that's all about?  Every town has the mayor character.  The mayor character.  And it's usually the guy that's the biggest drunk in town. 
[00:13:00]  At the bar all the time.  That's the only mayor I know.  Remember?  Hey, it's the mayor of Comac.  This buddy of mine, Steve, was like, hey, they called him the mayor of Comac.  Remember the mayor of Montauk, Mickey J, from our old days?  Mickey J.  He was the mayor.  He was a raging alcoholic.  Yeah.  And, you know, everybody knew him in town and he was just called the mayor.  So maybe when this guy was saying, hey, I'm the mayor, they're thinking on.  Oh, he's just the guy that occupies that stool all the time.  Yeah, another local drunk thinking he's the mayor. 
[00:13:30]  And he really is the mayor.  When he's really the mayor.  Of the second biggest, he's the second biggest town in Jersey City.  Look at that.  Wow.  What's the biggest, Newark?  You'd think you would know, Newark.  Newark and then Jersey City.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  We're going to break a little early today.  When we get back.  Yeah, when we get back, we got to talk about what happened to us after the show on Friday.  Oh, yeah.  This side of the Opie and Anthony show has no idea that all hell broke loose after we left 
[00:14:00]  the studio on Friday.  Yeah.  A big to-do.  A huge to-do.  An altercation.  Mm-hmm.  A big altercation.  Where now it's a big thing.  It's a thing now.  I spent half the weekend taking phone calls.  Oh, I got phone calls.  I don't even know what the hell they were about.  I don't even know what they were about.  From top brass.  It is what it is.  Simple as that.  It is what it is.  Yeah.  We'll get into all the details next if you haven't heard yet. 
[00:14:30]  But, you know, basically we leave this first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  We go downstairs in the lobby.  We grab some microphones.  And then we walk over to XM.  And that's broadcast exclusively on XM.  And we continue the show over there at XM.  Well, on our way to XM, there was a pretty big altercation.  Mayor Healey showed up.  Mayor Healey had to be subdued.  We'll get into all the details in just a bit.  Mayor Healey. 
[00:15:00]  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We didn't even want to start the show that way.  We just went off on a tangent with the drunk mayor of Jersey City.  Steve from Bayshore.  Where is it?  I had updated. 
[00:15:30]  Now I messed it up.  Oh, okay.  Healey, the mayor, was yelling,  I'm not only the mayor, but I'm also a client.  Nice hair, Mayor McDouchebag.  Yeah, someone suggested that with a head of hair like that,  the cops should have thrown him a beating.  Anyway, we got into a little altercation at the Friday show.  Yeah.  It's become a big thing over at XM for some reason.  It's a big thing over at XM.  Nowhere else, with no one else with the show. 
[00:16:00]  No, it's just...  Tom Chiosano walked in and went,  what's the big deal?  It's like, what happened?  What's the big deal?  One of those days, huh?  There was an altercation.  You got people around you to take care of that.  And they took care of the situation.  What's the big deal?  Remedied the problem.  Oh, man.  I wish Tom was next to me all weekend,  getting phone calls and text messages  and emails sent to the BlackBerry.  I made the mistake of taking the BlackBerry with me  over the weekend.  Oh, what a dummy.  I got to just leave that home for now on. 
[00:16:30]  My weekends are my weekends.  I've been in the radio biz long enough now  where I really don't need to take calls on the weekends.  Remember when we worked on Saturday?  I was thinking about that over the weekend  and gave me a little chuckle  when we were over at AAF.  Yeah, and Bruce doesn't realize...  And Brucey Mittman.  And Bruce doesn't understand  why we're not more appreciative.  Yeah, why we're not more appreciative.  Just six days a week for no money, Bruce. 
[00:17:00]  I started thinking about that.  You know, as time goes by,  and this happens with everything,  you only kind of think of the good parts of things.  And I have great memories of back then.  Really do.  I had a lot of fun, a lot of great things.  But then all these little things creep in  and you're like,  that son of a bitch made us work on Saturday,  which doesn't sound like a big deal to people.  Because I worked overtime, you know,  when I was in construction work Saturday.  And it sucked.  But you want your weekends.  You work five days a week,  you want your weekends.  And we were the stars of the radio station.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  The morning guy who's still up there rotting,  the Hillman.  He didn't work weekends.  He didn't have to work weekends.  He didn't work weekends.  We had to work weekends.  And we were the stars of the damn radio station.  And we went in,  and I was trying to figure out  what time we had it going.  Because I don't think it was our 3 to 7.  It was early.  It was early.  It was like 10 to 2.  Not only did we have to work weekends,  it screwed up our Friday night.  Yeah, it was like 10 to 2, I think.  Something like that.  Something ridiculous.  I think it was 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Well, we had to be in by 10,  so it screws up your Friday night.  Because now, you know, 
[00:18:00]  and believe me,  back then,  I might have been rolling in  at 9 in the morning.  Yeah.  And there were some times  I was up all night,  and I'd come staggering in  with Jay from Framingham,  and just,  we'd been out on our bender all night  at the local dives.  And then you're off at 2,  and you can't really start your Saturday.  No.  Because, I mean,  we were away from home.  We're from New York originally.  We wanted to go home some weekends.  Yep.  All of a sudden,  you're jumping in your car  at 3 in the afternoon on a Saturday. 
[00:18:30]  It's like,  wow, thanks for the weekend.  Yeah, you're getting a home,  then you've got to be back.  It was just ridiculous,  that Brucey Mittman  with the Saturday thing.  And then we finally were able  to negotiate  every other Saturday off  during the books  that weren't important.  That and a $2,000 raise  for each of us.  Thanks, Bruce.  You guys were doing Saturday  like 10 to 2?  Midday, Saturday,  playing music.  Just like, yeah,  six days a week.  Can we do that?  Just sitting there rotting.  Yeah, can we do that, please?  Sitting there rotting. 
[00:19:00]  Rotting away  in Worcester.  Anyway,  so our weekends  are our weekends.  They're our weekends.  I don't like taking calls.  I said we bill XM  for all the time  we had to spend this weekend  dealing with  the situation.  The situation.  The scary situation.  Elo likes to take  the bulls  by the bulls unit  a lot of times.  He likes doing that.  You know,  he's a take charge  kind of guy.  But I'll tell you.  First of all, 
[00:19:30]  I have to hear  through my agent  that Elo's a little upset  that I don't return  his phone calls  or emails.  I barely get his emails.  I don't know  where he's sending them to.  He told me  he was going to send me  an email this week.  He goes,  I'm going to send that  right off to you  during a phone call.  I check my email.  I never got it.  I think he's sending it  to my XM email,  which I never,  ever,  ever have answered  ever,  ever,  ever.  You know why?  Because I don't want  to have to sift  through 18,000 emails  from people going  cookies on the second floor. 
[00:20:00]  Well,  that would be great  if we worked in Washington  with you dopes.  You idiots  down in Washington.  You know,  we should talk about this.  Oh,  my God.  I was talking about this  with someone that works  in a big company.  So a lot of people  can relate to this.  I will never use  corporate email,  ever.  You get a corporate  email account  and you think  it would be great  to keep tabs  on everybody  and your workplace.  But yeah,  half the time  it's stupid emails  from stupid people  that are lucky  to even have a job  in your organization.  I've lost my keys 
[00:20:30]  in the lot today.  Right.  It's to my gray Nissan.  Right.  I believe I dropped them  between 2.45 and 3 o'clock.  If anyone sees them,  could you return them  to the secure?  And I got to,  I'm sad because I,  when I first started getting,  I had the BlackBerry.  I had the email account  set up for me at XM  and I'm scrolling going,  why am I getting these?  And how am I supposed  to find the important ones  through Mary going out tonight? 
[00:21:00]  I'll join you after work,  Fridays as usual.  Why am I reading this crap?  How about this one?  If anyone has found  a hoop earring,  I might have left it  in production room B12.  Bob, you left your headlights on.  Oh, did Bob?  Who cares?  You want to send one out?  Lost computer files  that I swapped  with Gary Glitter.  Please send immediately.  God, we should start doing that. 
[00:21:30]  Anyone I've had sex with  over the past six months,  test came back, yes, AIDS.  E-Rock just sent this one.  This was actually sent?  Just a corporate email  that just says,  it's a boy.  Oh, who cares?  Who gives a crap?  Who cares?  Who Logan got caught sleeping with?  So your wife spit one out.  Who cares?  You think you're the only one  that's spitting out a child?  No one cares except you  and your family.  It's got a fat tongue 
[00:22:00]  and a mohair cut.  Congrats.  It's an embarrassment.  Of course,  it'll be a medal winner.  It's a...  They all win medals.  It's a yuck.  It's a yuck.  Yeah.  If anyone has found my hoop earring.  Who cares?  You broads are lucky  to be in radio.  Stop messing up our corporate email  because the broads are the worst.  The broads are the worst.  Chatty Cathy's.  You know,  they're chatty Cathy's  to begin with  and then you give them  a Blackberry  where they have access 
[00:22:30]  to the entire company's email.  Now they can  meet you in the cafeteria.  What's for lunch today?  I don't know.  I'm on the low carb diet.  Who cares, fatty?  Who cares?  They try to be funny.  Oh, little jokes.  I'm being handed actual emails.  Oh, yeah.  He's going through them right now.  That goes to the entire company.  Anyone have Little Mermaid on DVD?  I need it for production.  Fired.  Right there.  If Elo, Elo,  instead of calling me 
[00:23:00]  at 9.30 on a Saturday night  when I'm trying to watch  The Da Vinci Code,  okay,  I don't know how it got to my house,  but it got there.  Instead of that,  go through your email.  You better not admit that,  by the way.  The lawyers will have to  discuss that forever.  Go situation.  Please.  Anytime you see an email  that says anything like that,  what was that one?  That last one?  The mermaid?  Looking for the Little Mermaid?  Looking for the Little Mermaid. 
[00:23:30]  If you see that,  Elo,  fire that person.  Can't you decide  who you want your emails from?  Can't you say,  I will only accept emails  from this, this, this, this,  so you'll only get corporate emails  that involve you?  I have no idea.  Why should you have to?  Why should I have to  figure out buttons like that?  Is this a real one?  It's corporate.  Massages on Thursday?  Who the hell is  giving massages on Thursday?  Eric Logan.  They have massage therapy.  Full release.  But it's only in D.C.  They have a massage therapist  that comes into the compound 
[00:24:00]  down there every Thursday?  Dude, they got a gym down there,  remember?  Yeah.  Wow, that's cool.  So you don't check your XM email  because of this?  I don't blame you.  I never check it,  but everybody else knows.  I've given every important person  my personal email that I use  that everybody uses for me,  and that's what I use.  What is it?  Oh, shut up.  It is fun, though,  when you get the email.  Blah Blah is no longer  with the company.  We wish him well,  but if you see him  in the building,  call security immediately. 
[00:24:30]  Bob Bradley is no longer  with XM.  It's always,  he's moving on  to bigger opportunities  or whatever.  Due to a mutual,  it's always this mutual thing,  he's decided to go  in another direction.  If you see Bob  in the building,  please phone security  at 305.  It's like,  he's a great guy,  we love him,  he left on his own accord,  but he will be maced,  and his hair will be tussled, 
[00:25:00]  and he'll have bruises  on his forehead  like a dopey mayor.  Why don't they just send  that in an honest one?  The cancer that was Bob Schwartz  has been cut free  from the XM lung.  You can't do that  in this stupid corporate world.  All albatross is gone.  I'm never honest.  Just a bunch of corporate BS  all the time.  Mr. Suggestions belong  in a baby diaper  that's finally been sent packing.  Good riddance.  If you see him,  say good riddance 
[00:25:30]  to bad rubbish.  So does he have  your private email or what?  I don't know.  Sometimes I get emails from him.  Yeah.  But then I think  after maybe a couple of shots,  he forgets my email  and sends it  to the corporate one.  So I never got his email  about what he was calling about,  which was,  you know,  the situation.  The situation.  Now,  I'm watching  The Da Vinci Code  and  it's one of those movies  you kind of  got to really  keep up on. 
[00:26:00]  It's not,  you know,  Speed 2  where perhaps  if I miss a few minutes,  it's okay  as long as the boat  rams the town  at the end.  I'm in.  I won.  It's a movie  you got to kind of  pay attention to.  So when the phone rings,  I get annoyed.  I don't care who it is.  I got to pause it  and now you kind of  get out of the whole  continuity  of what's going on.  You got to rewind  and rewatch  and figure out  what they're saying.  And it's Elo  on a Saturday  at 9.30 
[00:26:30]  from Georgia.  I don't know  what he's doing.  He's down in Georgia.  Why is he calling?  He's hiding.  He's a secret agent  on the weekends.  I think perhaps  he was having  a couple of  hot toddies.  Really?  Or maybe one of those  mint juleps.  He was at a party  with Clay Shaw.  With silver paint  on him or something.  He was a drinker.  He was a  David Ferry  dancing around  in stupid wigs 
[00:27:00]  with silver paint.  And silver paint  on him.  He was a drink away  from being tased.  Somewhere.  Elo, are you done?  Okay, I guess  he's done.  Elo's actually  a Klansman.  He goes down  to march.  No one could  see me under the hood.  Yeah, so he  called me up  and it was always  just, he was  talking about 
[00:27:30]  the situation.  Was he in the  situation room?  I think he was  in the situation room  with Wolf Blitzer.  He probably  had like a huge  like table  in front of him  and one of those  big pointy sticks  pointing at stuff.  Like Hitler  with the map.  Well, my generals.  See, this is where  the situation  got out of hand  and we need to  do a better job  next time this  happens.  Patting little  children on the  cheek.  I wish I had  a whole division  of DJs like you.  It's Lieberkinds. 
[00:28:00]  Lieberkinds.  Whatever they're  called.  Kinder.  Kinder Nazis.  I don't know.  So basically you  had to live the  Da Vinci Code is  what you're getting  at.  Yeah.  You were watching  the Da Vinci Code  but then Elo  called you because  I know what  you're going to  say.  All of a sudden  you have to now  live the Da Vinci  Code and figure  out the whole  puzzle that was  the situation.  Yeah, because  the situation  as it played  out is what  it is.  And we'll  explain it.  But Elo  being Brass 
[00:28:30]  doesn't want  to say  anything.  Which I guess  you know that's  what Brass  does.  It's called  plausible  deniability  in any  situation.  The upper  echelon always  wants plausible  deniability.  So they can  detach themselves  from a situation.  So as Elo  is trying to  explain to me  the situation  he didn't want  to explain in  any detail  so he can  later if he 
[00:29:00]  ever had to  say I  didn't know  nothing.  So it's like  in code he's  talking in this  code that I'm  trying to watch  the Da Vinci  Code and I'm  getting you  know FedEx  little boxes  with rolly  things on it  filled with  vinegar to  disintegrate  notes.  I'm getting  coded messages  that I have to  write down.  I want to  reach through  the phone and  choke him.  Do you know  what you do?  Here's how you  stop that.  You go look  dude I can't 
[00:29:30]  can you speak  up the tape  is not getting  any of this.  Is this being  taped?  Are you on a  cellular phone?  I don't know  you.  Prank caller  prank caller  prank caller.  It's just  fiction.  Yeah.  Very nice.  It's just  ridiculous.  Lance she's  dying on me  Lance.  Is this a  cell phone?  I don't know  you.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Love that one.  He comes  pulling up on  the lawn.  Yeah so  that's what I  had to deal 
[00:30:00]  with over the  weekend about  the situation.  A man with  a strange  haircut is  trying to  elevate this  situation into  something bigger  than it should  be.  What an ass.  Oh I love  the man but  Jesus between  Friday and  Monday I must  be left to my  own devices I  must be.  That's it.  He's still in  like secret agent 
[00:30:30]  mode too because  I gave him a  little info.  Because over at  XM we have our  own channel so  you know we  replay the show  all day long.  Yeah.  All day long.  But because of the  situation they went  into panicky Pete  mode.  Total.  And just completely  wiped it from the  replay.  Yeah.  They're like Stalin  over there.  Which didn't make  never existed  never happened.  Which didn't make  us happy at all.  Purge.  But then all of a  sudden there was a  glitch in the  computer and I  guess the show  re-ran overnight.  Oops.  So I told Elo 
[00:31:00]  about it he's like  I'm on it.  He writes me back  I'm here at XM  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  Elo loves this  because let me  tell you why.  I'm on it.  Because XM is  like Geek Central.  Just always has  been.  And there's  really not much  excitement going  on behind the  scenes there.  You know what's  happening.  The shows that  are being added.  Things like that.  That's the  excitement part.  But they don't  really get to  relish in that.  The on-air staff 
[00:31:30]  does.  They get hey  did you hear  about the new  transistor we  put in this  unit.  That's a trip  to Washington.  In meetings.  And that's  that's what they  live.  So something  like this.  Elo actually  put on like  a trench coat  and a Mike  Drudge hat  and he's 
[00:32:00]  walking around  in a film  noir.  He just  thinks he's  a secret agent.  He's manipulating  two little silver  balls in his  hands.  I knew there  was a way  that the replay  shouldn't have  happened.  They told me  the replay  shouldn't have  played.  Who had two  portions?  Who played  two portions  of the replay?  You had one.  Each one of  these cans  of sand  represent a  replay.  I got the  email.  It said  old yellow  stain in the  subject heading.  Called me  old mongoloid  head.  I heard him.  So Aaron 
[00:32:30]  Hughes on the  instant feedback  from Philly  getting messages  from Elo in  Parabolas.  Parabolas right?  P-A-R-A-B-L-E-S  Parables?  Parables sorry.  Getting messages  from Elo in  Parables sorry.  And lemon water  notes that you  have to put up to  the light and burn  to read.  Elo's got a  little spy kitty  bought a  toy.  Toys R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.  With a decoder  ring.  I'm down here at  XM.  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  Guys, I'm just  going to refer to it 
[00:33:00]  as the situation.  But you know  what I'm talking  about.  Hold on.  I think I've  been tailed.  All right,  it's cold.  No, it's just  a broad down here  trying to  do production.  It's just some  Some bitch sending an email about her hoop earring.  I thought she was taking a picture of me with her phone,  but she's just sending out an email to corporate  about the fact that her little kid just took a whizzy for the first time.  Wait a minute, hold on. 
[00:33:30]  I gotta go.  I think someone's chasing me.  I'll call you back later.  Hello, Elo?  Elo!  Elo just bought an Austin Martin.  He's driving around in an Austin Martin he can't afford.  He's writing emails in code.  Oh, jeez.  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  I'll get back to you.  I'll find out what happened.  I'm in Washington.  There's been a breach.  Oh, my God.  There's a breach. 
[00:34:00]  We better talk to the lawyers about this one for five hours.  Stupid lawyers ruining radio across the ball field.  There was a day that radio stations had nothing to do with lawyers.  Every once in a while, there would be a situation.  You had to go find one.  Hey, can you help me out?  Give me a little advice.  Sure, $100 an hour.  Blah, blah.  This is what you do.  Now there's lawyers on the payroll.  Anything out of the ordinary, and I mean ordinary, that happens.  They feel they have to consult with lawyers.  It's just, it's tragic. 
[00:34:30]  And it goes against what radio is all about.  You try to be compelling.  You try to create water cooler talk.  You try to be spontaneous.  You try to create a buzz.  But in the lawyer world, creating a buzz is not good.  You've got to squash every situation because you don't want it to become bigger than it is.  Yeah.  God forbid it becomes bigger than it is, and everyone starts talking about you.  Yeah.  And talking about the radio station and the show.  It's Elo.  Yeah.  I believe the person involved is either Martin Landau or Robert Culp. 
[00:35:00]  I saw they were guilty on Columbo last night.  I just figured I'd throw them in.  Wait.  Hold it.  Someone's coming.  Someone's coming.  Oh.  Oh, it's nobody.  Just Estrello.  Nobody.  It's Don Wicklin.  No one important.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm going to call you at 0700.  Wait.  What time is that? 
[00:35:30]  Is that 7 in the morning or 7 at night?  I can never get that straight.  07.  Okay.  I'll call you at 7 in the morning.  Damn it.  I wish I knew what those numbers were.  Okay.  Hold on.  Someone's coming.  I took a phone call from him on the way back from the Jersey Shore going, I cannot believe  how serious I have to take this with him.  He's a madman.  Absolutely.  Chris from Houston.  Elo is old Agatha Christie.  And then Flying Standby writes, was the secret message from Elo, drink more Ovaltine. 
[00:36:00]  I couldn't even get it out.  That's a good one.  I lost in the middle of that.  Very good, man.  Flying Standby.  Yes.  Aston Martin.  Martin, okay.  I said Austin Martin.  I'm thinking of Austin Powers.  Ah, whatever.  He probably tries an Austin Martin.  Shut up.  Whatever.  We all understood.  All right.  Can you screw up one word?  My God.  I let it go.  Especially Aston.  Did you know it was Aston?  Yes.  No, you didn't.  I did.  I thought actually Austin Martin, we were kidding.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  We all knew, though.  Yeah.  So what?  You humiliated yourself.  I'm getting at it.  I did?  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Eli in Brooklyn.  Eli.  Hey, guys.  Actually, I'm in Manhattan.  I saw Elo on 57th Street talking into his shoe.  He was telling someone a paraply.  Chief?  That's what he needs.  Punch it out.  It's Elo, Chief.  We have to talk under the cone of silence.  Not the cone of silence.  He turns into get smart. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, radio just stinks.  He's having right now down at XM installed a bunch of doors.  Right.  20 doors he has to walk through before he goes into a phone booth and drops down an elevator  to his office.  It's actually simpler than the way they do things now.  That's stupid security.  Remove all lawyers from radio, please.  Let's go back to the old days.  They screw up everything.  Well, now we have to take a break before we tell everyone what happened. 
[00:37:30]  He was just beside himself.  He was so, like, disturbed yet happy he had something exciting to talk about.  All right, we'll take a break.  When we get back, we'll tell you what happened.  Finally, we went off on a little tangent there.  We've got to try to stay on track.  So, after this show, on Friday, in the street, we had a pretty big altercation.  And we'll get into all the details next, okay?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:38:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  More corporate email coming in, by the way.  All.  From Rob to all the XM staff.  It's a waterhead.  From Bob from the third floor.  It's a waterhead.  Congrats.  Congrats.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  1-866-313-FREE.  All right, so let's get right into this.  This is how we wanted to start the show, but, I don't know, a lot of energy today,  so we're going off on some tangents.  We get distracted easily.  We have the greatest job in radio. 
[00:38:30]  We do two shows every day, basically.  Yep.  We're on satellite radio.  We're also on regular radio.  The first half of the Opie and Anthony show is heard by regular radio and the XM Nation.  Uh-huh.  And then around 10 to 9, 5 to 9, we leave our post here in New York City at Free FM.  We go down the lobby, we're handed some wireless mics, and we make the walk to XM.  It is affectionately known as The Walkover.  The Walkover.  We call it The Walkover. 
[00:39:00]  And it's broadcast live on XM.  Every day.  And every day we do something a little different.  Some days it's just us walking over there, commenting on people, and nothing really happens.  Other days it's pure gold.  We get many of the various personalities that are all over the city, and it's fun.  And we take a little longer.  It's not a thing that's a set amount of time.  Sometimes, yeah, like I said, very quick.  Sometimes we're out there for quite a while if something's happening. 
[00:39:30]  All depends.  And the thing about it is it's so unplanned, spontaneous, and off the cuff,  you just never know what's going to happen during that walk.  Right.  And Friday all hell broke loose, and there was a situation.  Situation.  Basically, and our fans follow us every morning.  And by the way, we are walking today.  There's a lot of controversy.  Will they ever walk again?  Will they ever do The Walkover again?  I'm walking.  I'm walking from here to there.  Of course, we're going to walk again.  I thought we fell off a horse in a stupid cape.  Yeah, how else are we going to get there? 
[00:40:00]  Are we going to get a helicopter from one roof to the other?  We're going to be bussed like the dog day afternoon escape from the bank.  We're going to come out in a big circle.  Of course, we're walking today, and then we invite you to join us for The Walk like we do every day.  Okay, so we're walking down the sidewalk.  We're broadcasting exclusively to AXM at this point, and we come upon a guy, just a zero.  So, yeah, huge fan of the show.  You know, you're all right, dude, but you had a weird lisp. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, we were talking to the army.  I blame the guy with the lisp, or we would have kept walking.  He was a big fan.  He liked the posters that were being put up in the subways.  Yeah, here in New York City, Free FM, they're advertising the show.  Imagine that.  Right out of the box, they're advertising.  Nice, on buses, we're on buses, we're on, like, billboard things, we're on-  Subway platforms.  Subways, yeah.  And it's our picture, and it says we're back, and it has us with, like, it's kind of wacky, 
[00:41:00]  I got to admit.  But it's very subtle.  You got to say that this is subtle.  It's not like we're wearing wings and a halo.  Oh, it's not as bad as, you know-  Being in a Boy Scout uniform?  Yeah, exactly.  That's just ridiculous and stupid, and we'll never do that.  It's just pictures of us, and very subtly drawn behind us, kind of.  Well, yeah, it was a picture from our photo shoot.  Yeah.  So we had nothing to do with how they doctored the photo.  No.  Because other DJs would actually put on halos and- 
[00:41:30]  And wings.  And angel wings.  Ooh, I want to wear angel wings.  That was in post-prod, man.  Yeah.  They, yeah, drew in this white halo and little, like, abstract-type wings.  Very, very wispy.  They don't look like wings.  I told Tom that.  They look like you're standing in front of two clouds.  Yeah.  Yeah, they kind of do.  Maybe that's what they are.  Maybe we're up in heaven.  No.  I love people that come to you with something, and they go, hey, how does it look, guys? 
[00:42:00]  And you go, well, it looks like clouds.  I don't know.  And they still use it.  Yeah.  Why are you asking?  Yeah.  Why are you asking if you're not going to change it?  It still does the job, though.  It says we're back, the radio station, and I don't know, and they're sorry or something  like that.  Yeah.  Is the slogan.  It's something like, yeah, our bad.  So one of our faithful fans was on the walkover on Friday, and he's standing there waiting  for us to arrive outside XM or close to outside XM, and he's got one of the huge posters. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, they got the poster.  Yeah, the poster.  Oh, about the pictures also?  So again, I got to just yell at XM, because they were their pictures.  They were the picture that we took for the XM photo shoot.  Right.  I had sent over a note saying, can you remove the thing that looks like a mole next to  my nose?  Because I don't have a mole next to my nose.  There's some kind of black dot.  Ew, you got a mole? 
[00:43:00]  Let me see.  I don't have a...  Jimmy, look at him.  What's going on over there?  Anthony Crawford.  Shut up.  Because I don't...  There's nothing.  Hello, Cindy Crawford.  Dude, there is no mole.  Are you sure?  Jimmy, take a look.  Point out one.  If we were on XM, I swear I'd be cursing like a son of a...  It looks like Richard years back.  That's a huge little mole you have there.  It's kind of cute.  He's actually losing it.  I want to kiss his mole.  Because...  Oh, Aaron Neville.  Yeah.  Aaron Neville next to my... 
[00:43:30]  It's the opiate mole-y show.  So is there hair growing out of this mole you have on your face?  If you find it, more power to you.  The fact of the matter is there is no mole next to my nose.  And I'm sure on the message boards that I can start a Photoshop with you with moles.  Oh, look at my character's shovel.  Big mole.  But the picture that went up on the side of Madison Square Garden, the big banner, and  the pictures, I think, I'm not even sure about this, that we sign. 
[00:44:00]  The publicity shots.  That had been taken out.  And I said, when we got the proofs back, they go, which pictures do you like?  Remember that whole production?  Which pictures do you like?  We decided on which ones we liked.  And then I sent an email with the picture and said...  And I circled it on my own computer.  I circled it and said, what the hell is this?  Oh, I remember that now.  Yeah, because I...  It was something on the film.  It wasn't even on me.  Because I don't have a mole. 
[00:44:30]  And it wasn't a zit or anything.  It was just...  It was something on the film.  I circled it and said, what the hell is this?  Can you please have this removed from the photo?  And with my own Photoshopping skills, I showed how easy it is to just take off with the clone  tool.  Ooh, clones.  And you just like kind of, you know, click, click, click.  It's gone.  And then I sent that off and they said, okay.  And for that one instance, that mole thing that doesn't exist was gone. 
[00:45:00]  So you would think when CBS asked for photos of us to use on this giant campaign, that some  effing idiot that is in charge over there at XM would know.  Use the picture that the final version of it.  But no, they gave them the one with the stupid mole that doesn't exist on the side of my  face.  And that now is on the back of every bus, the side of the buses, the billboards, the 
[00:45:30]  subways are not that I, you know, something.  And it's not even like our publicity shots with XM have been just a complete disaster.  Horrendous worst pictures ever.  There's a guy I refuse to talk to and I want to, in the words of Jimmy, I want to bite  him so bad every time I see him to this day.  There was a shot they took when we signed with XM, right?  Yeah.  And they liked Anthony because he was given like an eyebrow salute, a one eyebrow salute. 
[00:46:00]  Kind of the Spock eyebrow where the one eyebrow goes up very inquisitive.  I've got a crazy thought.  Like, hey, I'm thinking.  And it came out, his portion of the shot came out very well, but they shot both of  us.  And in that particular shot, I looked absolutely awful.  My eyes were half closed and I wasn't really smiling.  The guy goes, oh, don't worry about it.  I'll fix that.  I'll Photoshop a smile and I'll open your eyes up.  I'm like, no.  And then he goes, he goes, look, I'll show you. 
[00:46:30]  And he shows me ahead of time.  I go, look, I'm telling you right now, that looks so ridiculous and so fake.  It's like the Black Hole Sun video.  Don't do it.  We took 100 shots that day.  Just use another one, right?  And just like we said with Jimmy saying that the wings look like clouds and people ask you  for your, you know, what do you think?  You tell them what you think and they don't change it anyway.  This guy decided, no, he's going to do it anyway because he thinks he's got skills or  something.  This picture looks so ridiculous.  You at home, try to open your eyes as wide as you can and smile at the same time. 
[00:47:00]  And look in the mirror.  It's almost impossible.  Well, this dope down there in Washington did just that.  And this was sent out to all the media.  And then I guess they took my head from another picture and put it on my body and they didn't  match it up right.  So I got giraffe neck.  Giraffe neck.  I got giraffe neck.  My eyes are as wide as possible and I'm smiling.  It looks so ridiculous.  And after I said, do not use this picture, not only did they use the picture, when we 
[00:47:30]  started up in another city or anywhere else, they still have that old photo and they're  using it like crazy to this day.  And don't forget the other one where we had the Ronald Reagan makeup on because we had  some hippie chick they hired for the day to put makeup on our face that wanted to bang  Robert Plant.  That was some of the worst makeup they've ever put on us.  It was Ronald Reagan makeup.  I had rouge on my cheeks and this foundation and mascara. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know what the hell this woman did.  And remember, there was no mirror for us to look into.  No.  She saw us, but it wasn't a makeup room or anything.  It was this thrown together thing.  So she was able to see us and she did the makeup, but then we couldn't see it.  And when the photos came out, we were like, this can't be used.  I look so sickly.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.  She had no clue what she was doing.  They hired her for the day.  Big rosy cheeks.  Because probably because she was cheap. 
[00:48:30]  Dog do hairdo.  Yeah.  Douches with rosacea.  Oh, that's what it looked like.  It was horrendous.  And it was like pancake makeup, which they use in a lot of photo shoots.  But in this case, it was just put on wrong.  And then this red crap.  And it was just the worst shot ever.  They slipped the surly bonds of earth and made up the face of God with bad pancake makeup.  Right.  And then someone down there.  Hello.  Someone down there.  It's their job to look at these pictures.  And someone approves it and said, yeah, this is good enough to send to the entire universe. 
[00:49:00]  They just are awful when it comes to that.  I want to see the mole picture.  Look at any one of the – look at the publicity shot.  Go to cbsradio.com.  There you go.  Oh, can we mention that here?  Go to cbsradio.com and look at the picture.  And I will show you a retouched picture where that flaw in the film is gone. 
[00:49:30]  Jimmy's now looking at the picture.  Believe me.  I know.  Jimmy's smiling.  Let me tell you something.  I understand something completely.  I don't need 20 emails telling me that I'm Mr. Hollywood star.  I know.  Believe me.  Believe me.  How bad is it, Jimmy?  I am completely made for radio.  I know that.  But it's – and it doesn't piss me off.  It's like, oh, I look better without that.  That has nothing to do with it.  It's the fact that something competent down there that released that picture should have known that there was a version without a piece of something on the film. 
[00:50:00]  Looks like one of those little trademark circles you see.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty bad?  Dude, it's ridiculous.  Holy douche.  It doesn't belong there.  It's not there.  I don't have one.  I've never had anything on either side here.  And it's there.  And you think they would learn down there?  I learned.  After the first photo shoot that caused a major problem.  They removed it the first time.  I think it looks kind of – it gives you character.  Character.  I like you.  Shut up.  I want one. 
[00:50:30]  It's like a – what's the name?  Enrique Iglesias.  Enrique Iglesias is horrible.  Molly, molly, molly, molly, molly, moll.  All right.  So anyway, getting back at – getting back to the situation.  Lord.  We got to get back to the situation.  They're going to kill us.  They're like, what's the story, asses?  Calling you a teasing idiot.  So we walk up the sidewalk and the guy has one of the big posters from the subway that  he paid, what, $10 for from a homeless guy?  We got a homeless guy to grab – the poster was in the subway and he said – the homeless 
[00:51:00]  guy just took it up for him.  Yes.  From the subway.  So he's very excited to show us because we haven't seen these posters because they  just hit New York City.  I've seen a million of them, by the way, since then.  They're all over New York, which is very cool.  Thanks for the advertising over here.  We greatly appreciate it.  So that's the only reason we really stopped to talk to this guy.  And then we were going to continue.  There was really not much going on in the walk.  And we're like, oh, that's pretty cool.  And the only reason we stopped and continued was because the guy had a bad lisp.  And, of course, we have to make fun of that.  We have to. 
[00:51:30]  It's our job.  Just keep asking him questions like, what is that again?  Oh, this poster.  We got a poster.  Subway.  Subway.  How do they put it up?  The back is sticky.  Sticky.  Baton Rouge, stupid.  Baton Rouge.  He was horrible.  A lispy idiot.  So then out of nowhere –  Baby talk, baby talk.  It's a wonder you can walk.  Oh, yeah.  That was funny.  In the middle of Anthony goes, Buddy Hinton should beat you up.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really made me –  That was a very good line.  So then out of nowhere this guy, you know – 
[00:52:00]  Douche.  A douche.  Yeah.  Makes himself known in the crowd.  Like, oh, what do we got here?  Oh, ONA's whole audience decided to make it.  By the way, at this time we're not allowed to play the audio.  And I know there's a lot of people out there, we'll just play it.  We can't.  We'll get fired.  It's the miracle of the internet.  Figure it out.  We'll get fired.  But the audio is all over the place.  Don't worry about it.  It's all over the place.  Looks like Ant has a raisinet on his face. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, Mike from Long Island.  See, that's what I hate.  Why?  I don't have a raisinet on my face.  Nor a goober.  You're sweet.  Tony Bagels, why does Ant know what Enrique Iglesias looks like?  He's been on 8,000 TV commercials and shows.  And how do you not know what he looks like?  We all know what he looks like because he's banging on the girl, you idiot.  Because I'm gay for him, jackass.  What's wrong with that? 
[00:53:00]  He's a good singer.  Anyway, so this guy makes himself known.  And I guess he's going to try to get a situation going.  Is he?  Have you heard anything?  What?  He means at the moment.  At the moment.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  What are you talking about?  The situation going.  At the moment.  When it was happening.  Yeah.  Oprah's saying that the guy was going to get a situation going in the moment.  And Ant is going, is he like you mean now?  Yeah.  He wanted to disrupt our little walkover, which is nearly impossible. 
[00:53:30]  Unless you, you know, mow us down with a car.  But please don't.  So he comes over with this stupid crew cut.  And he starts going, hey, audience.  O&A's whole audience is here.  Which is just such hack material.  Hey, a whole audience.  You know, I hear you guys only had like 30,000 people subscribe.  Howard Stern got a big, and I love him.  Oh, really?  Does he and do you?  So I had the mic, and I'm like, all right, go ahead, go. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Now, everyone in this situation, let me explain to some of the listeners what it's like.  When you have those hardcore Howie fans, they're a breed apart from the people that just enjoyed listening to the show.  That's fine.  You know, you enjoy listening to the show.  You listen to it sometimes, whatever.  You listen to it a lot, whatever.  But then there's those people that still think it's like 1991 or something.  They're the ones that yell out Baba Booey still. 
[00:54:30]  I mean, you know, it was funny.  I used to laugh my ass off when I'd be watching CNN, and that would happen.  It was spontaneous.  It was funny.  It was new.  But there are some people that just still are latched on to that mindset.  And this guy was a prime example of that and thought if he walked up to us and started disrupting the show that we would get all freaked out and react by, you know, either ignoring him or walking away or something.  Our reaction to this situation, people, we'll spell it out for you right now, is to give you the microphone and let you go. 
[00:55:00]  Go ahead.  He wanted mic time on our show to praise Howard and to bash us.  Feel free.  You will always get your chance to talk.  So we gave him the mic.  He had nothing.  What did he say?  He's like, yeah.  You know, he's like, yes, your whole audience and this and that.  So I'm like, all right, go ahead and talk.  And he just, he, what did he say?  He said something after that.  He said O&A are douchebags. 
[00:55:30]  O&A are douchebags and they steal from Howard.  And you can hear him gulping.  Yeah, he was starting to sweat.  If you listen to the audio, which I heard a million times over the weekend, you can hear him gulping because he's like, uh-oh.  He lost all confidence.  He starts talking a little lower.  Like this wasn't a good idea.  Uh-oh.  I said to him, is that all you got?  Yeah.  And then Jimmy just berated him.  I was embarrassed for him.  Yeah.  I was like, what do you think?  This is a Larry King show.  We're going to panic and go to break.  Stupid guy.  Yeah.  Talk.  And it wasn't even like you, you berated him, but it wasn't like yelling or anything. 
[00:56:00]  Jimmy was just being very logical and, and soft spoken to the guy and saying like, is that all you have?  He goes, and I'm not even talking about comedy, just anything.  Because the guy goes, I'm not a comedian.  It's like, I'm like, dude, it's not about being funny.  You got no passion.  Right.  You got no passion for it.  You got, you don't have the oomph, the gumption to, you're on mic here.  We're, we're giving you the forum.  You have the floor.  Go.  And he had nothing.  How do you think it was going to, you know, play out?  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  That's what went through my head.  And you're all going to just collapse and go, oh God, you're right.  Oh no, like he, some, somebody on the message board and I can't remember who it was, but  I think it might've been Norton's hog.  I don't want to give credit to the wrong person, but spelt it out perfectly.  He had the whole scenario of what this guy thought was going to happen in his head, how  it was going to be.  He was going to be a hero and this was going to be his in.  So he was going to be able to be on Howie show and, and like be a regular and call in. 
[00:57:00]  And, and this was going to be a gig and like this whole delusion of grandeur built up in  his head.  And when it came down to it to zero hour, he failed so completely and so miserably that  he looked like a fool, uh, in front of a live audience that was following us and to the radio  audience.  Right.  And us and us.  Right.  And he said something that he was hoping for reaction.  I started the obnoxious laugh and then the, uh, the crowd, you know, started in with them, 
[00:57:30]  started laughing really hard.  Oh, he said, uh, he said, uh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you guys, uh, you guys steal from Howard.  I said, yeah, we do.  We stole all his radio stations and everyone started cracking up and he goes, no, and he  tried saying something else.  And the crowd just drowned him out with their laughing at him obnoxious laugh at that point.  They all did the obnoxious laugh at him and he apparently seemed to have lost his mind  at that point. 
[00:58:00]  He's like, he said something like, uh, someone spit on me.  Yeah.  Nobody did.  No one.  Yeah.  There was no spittle.  Stupid.  There was no spittle placed on you, sir.  Ugh.  And, uh, when I turned around, I saw him lunge toward our producer.  Well, at this point he had nothing left and he, he was looking like an ass.  So, you know, he, he just decided I got to, you know, start trouble.  I got to do something.  So he went after Ben.  He, he went after Ben.  He grabbed him or pushed him or had him by the neck. 
[00:58:30]  I saw the whole thing.  And I saw exactly how this happened.  He grabbed Ben with his left hand.  He grabbed him by his lapel, uh, and kind of slammed him against a wooden wall, like a  temporary wall that's built during a construction sites, kind of a thing.  And then his right hand grabbed him kind of by the, the front of his shirt.  But I saw his arms slipping up where his wrist and forearm was going against Ben's neck. 
[00:59:00]  And that's all I saw.  Cause instantly I thought, oh my God, this guy's going to start choking Ben against the  wall with his, with his arm.  He's giving him a forearm against the neck.  Uh, that's where it ended a split sec within a split second.  The guy was subdued.  Yeah.  Well, the situation was remedied.  Steve and Kenny, uh, had the guy and then Poe came out of nowhere and tie the guy up in 
[00:59:30]  a submission hold.  I think it's called the Los Angeles, uh, submission.  What is it called?  Kenny?  Kenny actually knows the name of the hole that, uh, Poe used.  That's the famous LA choke hold.  Oh, it's where you tie up the body.  You got your, your, uh, bicep and forearm around his neck, but the guy wasn't being choked  out.  He obviously was being subdued.  He was even in a submission hold, but I've seen that hold done where the guy goes out in 
[01:00:00]  a second.  Yeah.  He was just taken out of the situation.  I was taken out of the situation.  He was, he was being restrained, restrained.  He was able to talk.  Uh, he wasn't able to move.  I've never seen like, since like Hoist Gracie in, uh, the ultimate fighting would tie someone  up.  I've never seen someone in such a position where they could not even scratch with one  finger.  Here's the bottom line.  Nobody knew if he had a weapon.  Yeah.  If you're stupid enough to try to throw our producer up against the wall, what do you 
[01:00:30]  expect?  You're going to be subdued.  That's what's going to, a bottom line is I can go into his head.  He didn't know that that, I don't think he knew Ben was a producer.  Thought maybe it was just a listener.  He probably thought Ben was a fan because Ben looks like one of our dumb fans.  Um, just a guy with glasses kind of bumbling around.  Yeah.  And, um, I think he probably thought he was going to save face by taking out some of his  aggression on one of the guys in the crowd that was laughing at him.  So, uh, he just picked the wrong hombre to throw against the wall.  Yeah.  And post subdued him.  Kenny and Steve pushed him back and post subdued him and nobody heard him. 
[01:01:00]  Well, Steve was trying to get him into a cute little bear hug.  The whole thing with any kind of bear hug and hold them, hold them.  Paul wanted to, he could have pulled your pants down and raped you.  Stupid.  And Paul was logical with him.  He goes, do you have any weapons on you?  And the guy's like, he asked him the other question.  No, I don't.  Everybody's laughing at him and yelling at him because that's what he deserved for being  a jackass.  And he was able to communicate.  He was able to talk.  Of course he was.  There wasn't a, uh, you know, it wasn't like he was being choked out.  There wasn't one of those things going on.  The guy was able to talk because apparently I heard, uh, although a little muffled from 
[01:01:30]  the concrete, I heard an apology, which was nice.  You know, it was nice of him to apologize.  And then posted, I'm going to let you up.  You're not going to give me a reason to put you down again.  And the guy said, no.  So Paul let him up.  And he let him up.  That was it.  And that was it.  Nobody stomped him.  Nobody jumped on him.  Nobody touched him.  There wasn't any kicking.  And that was it.  Baby.  There was nothing else going on.  There was no taunting or anything.  Oof.  It was, uh, it was no big deal.  Oh.  Sorry.  Air show crash right behind you. 
[01:02:00]  That's a little hard to, that's a little distracting not to look at.  Watching a billion dollar piece of machinery just disintegrate.  Every summer.  Yeah.  The air show disaster.  I love it.  Yeah.  So, uh, that was, uh, our situation.  Yeah.  That happened Friday.  I, I, uh, I may have lost my mind for a couple seconds.  Maybe.  Oh, we both went.  Well, now, now here, here's what happens.  I may have, uh, let the psycho factor pop out for a split second or two. 
[01:02:30]  Here's what happens that a lot of people don't understand.  Also, we are in the middle of doing a radio show at that point.  We can't, we can't leave the radio show.  The mics are still live.  So, what you're going to get is what you're going to get.  We know we're on the air.  We still have our microphones.  So, when that guy was down, because he was being such a tough guy, uh, when he was, uh,  in a submission hold, me and Opie decided to maybe remind him that that was probably 
[01:03:00]  not the best move he could have made, was attacking our executive producer.  And, uh, we're, we're still doing a show, so we're on the mics.  And, uh, I wanted to hear what he had to say.  So, I put the mic to his face.  Yeah.  And Opie knelt down and gave him a little reminder that perhaps that wasn't the wisest  decision.  Yeah, I just said, uh, tsk, tsk, young man.  Something like tsk, tsk.  I went tsk, tsk, young man. 
[01:03:30]  Someone said my voice went from radio voice to Italian mobster in a split second.  And also that I sounded like, uh, one of the cast of Clockwork Orange.  Put your hands on our bandage.  Very well, little brother.  Very well.  Won't you, uh, apologize?  No.  My, my throat won't allow it.  I actually, um, hurt my throat really bad.  Ah.  I think it's close to back to normal today. 
[01:04:00]  And this is what I love.  Yeah.  When you have to where the guy's going, I was just expressing my opinion.  No one cared that you were expressing your opinion.  No.  Just don't lie, dude.  No.  Just admit what happened, man.  You were like being an ass.  You embarrassed yourself horribly.  Nobody here was going to stop you.  You want to make an ass out of yourself.  Go ahead.  That's when you grabbed Ben.  You grabbed the wrong guy.  You got physical.  You were restrained.  And you were really embarrassed.  If you didn't grab.  Really embarrassed.  If you, if that guy hadn't grabbed Ben, he would have left the situation. 
[01:04:30]  We would have continued the walk because it was over.  It was boring.  The guy was getting, you know, he had nothing.  He would have looked like an idiot.  We probably would have, you know, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan him up to the door of XM and walked in.  And that would have been it.  It wasn't the fact that he was expressing his opinion.  We welcome that.  We give you a microphone to do that with.  We're not going to run away.  We're not going to chase you away.  That's what other shows do.  If that's what you're used to hearing. 
[01:05:00]  And from what I've seen and heard, that is what he's used to.  Because that guy won't give anybody a microphone to express their opinion.  Needs complete control at all time.  We give you the mic.  You don't like us.  Let's hear why.  And then we'll rip you apart.  If you, if you think, if you think it could come upon three guys who's living it is to just bash people.  And Jimmy Norton, who not only during the day, but at night at the comedy clubs, is just berated and doing berating to other people. 
[01:05:30]  You want to come up and go head to toe with the likes of him?  Good luck.  You better come a little more prepared with your material, not with your hands.  And there was no passion.  That was what annoyed me.  It wasn't like, like I've watched the pest assaults in recent times.  They're just, they're just miscreant animals.  It's brutality without any physical contact.  Yeah, without, it's, it's mental and verbal brutality that the pests bring.  And, and, you know, a few, not even a few, so far one of Howie's people instantly decide, you know, he's got to bring violence into it. 
[01:06:00]  You know, you're just an ass.  You're someone who couldn't cut it with your, with your wit and with your, your voice.  So you had to take to using your hands and look where it got you.  Nothing creative.  You came with that.  Nothing creative.  It was a cornball 1991 insult.  And it's like, nobody is going to back off from that.  You know, we've.  That's a zoo crew in Philly, you idiot.  There's been a big rift and a big battle going on between our audience and his audience. 
[01:06:30]  And I'm sorry, I might be biased, but ours is just so much more funny and clever and, and they know how to brutalize people within the boundaries of the law, you know, with, with the signs and the taunting and their appearance.  It's just awful.  It's just awful.  Bam, who's one of the, the, the pest, the main pest is a physical disaster. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, and he just has a set on him.  He'll walk right up to people and just start mouthing off.  He has an awful gut.  He looks like he's pregnant, but he wears tight dockers and a medium button down shirt and he shaves once a month.  By the way, guilty spark from the SF feedback, tsk, tsk equals losing your ass completely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I must have listened to the audio of that.  I may have. 
[01:07:30]  15 times.  I may have said mother effer and.  Oh, plenty of times.  Yeah.  And how does that feel effer?  How does that feel effer?  You mother effer.  Yeah, it was, it was brutal.  You want to be a tough guy.  Well, this is being a tough guy.  And you were screaming it, but that's, you know, the guy gets, you raise, you use your hand when you're, when you're just going back and forth on mic or off, just, you know, like the pests do or like any one of them have the opportunity to do. 
[01:08:00]  That's fine.  Like I said, it's welcome.  Bring it on.  Cause it makes for funny radio when you are just verbally shredded.  By the way, we're not allowed to play the audio yet.  Yeah.  Yet the lawyers are deciding.  And then the lawyers down there in Washington, they want to give us an edited version.  I'm like, yeah, no.  Oh, go to hell.  I'm not playing an edited version.  A lawyer friendly version of, of a big, huge incident.  Yeah.  Let the lawyer edit that. 
[01:08:30]  I'm sure.  Yeah.  It'll just be fun filled.  Can we put on a little play and maybe have people play our parts and just get the transcript?  And that'd be fun.  That can be a lot of fun.  The transcript.  The transcript.  We could play ourselves.  And then we hand out scripts to everybody.  No, I want someone else to play me.  I want to see.  Oh, really?  I'm going to see if they can play me right.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Paul in Westchester.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  All right, Paul.  All right.  I just wanted to say, Anthony, you're the best line of every part in there. 
[01:09:00]  Ooh.  When he had said, he spit on me.  Now, he couldn't spit on you.  He had too much.  He does too much cocaine to work up the saliva.  That was the best line of it all.  Yeah, you've got to keep the humor in it.  You're going to make a Ben cocaine joke in the middle of that whole thing.  People are searching out this audio all over the Internet.  They are listening to it all weekend long like crazy.  But XM decided to remove it from the replay of our show over there. 
[01:09:30]  Trying to make believe it never happened, I guess.  I mean, it's already out there.  Secret agent Elo.  He had the tapes made into microfilm just so he could swallow it.  But that's pretty much what happened.  It would be much better if we could play the audio to kind of show you exactly what happened.  We got a record of it.  It was taped because, you know, we're doing a radio show.  Yeah.  And then some idiots from, like, Stern's camp saying, oh, they faked the whole thing.  Oh, yeah, that it was fake and stuff. 
[01:10:00]  You know, I only read what our message board people post.  And they're like, can you believe this ridiculous idiot had posted this?  And they show a post from a Stern fan.  And it's like you could tell it was fake that that guy was one of their guys.  And the desperation over there in that camp is just ridiculous.  One guy, one passionless zilch comes over to try to go toe to toe and just gets shredded. 
[01:10:30]  And that's when he decides, oh, I got to pin someone against the wall now.  Good job.  Job well done.  That's pretty much it, right?  Did we cover it all?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's about it.  We'll see where it goes.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  Why don't we just, he should just let it go.  It's not a big deal.  He was a goose. 
[01:11:00]  Who, the guy?  He behaved like a silly goose.  Oh.  Yeah, that's stupid.  Now, part of O&A history.  And audio that people are trying to get their hands on.  Oh, yeah.  They're finding it.  It's out there.  Just do a little surfing.  You'll find it.  I heard I'm on the Jim Norton MySpace.  There's a lot.  Is it?  Yeah.  You ass.  Actually, it's on the Ticketmaster website.  Oh.  Let's not forget the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Show. 
[01:11:30]  Where's my sheet?  There's a sheet we got to read.  We got a huge sponsor for our comedy festival.  I'd like to make a hot cake analogy that I made up.  Oh, I like this already.  About the tickets.  All right.  They're going like hot cakes.  That's right.  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon  to a venue near you.  We got three dates so far.  August 5th, Worcester Centrum in Boston.  August 26th, the PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey.  September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Philly, across the river in Camden, New Jersey. 
[01:12:00]  Tickets went on sale this past Friday.  They're going like hot cakes.  Oh, like hot cakes.  And cakes.  And you can get tickets through Ticketmaster, presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  We're going to have a great time.  It's all the comedians you know and love from this fine radio show.  If you want to look for the lineup for the show you're going to, I guess, go to our website  that we can't promote yet.  Yes.  Just go to our website, or I'm sure Ticketmaster will have all the info.  They're going like waffles. 
[01:12:30]  But it's the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006, brought to you by Bud Light.  Yeah.  Very, very cool.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody.  Opie, Anthony, Jim, Norton.  E-Rock is trying to tell us a story, but his face is like beet red from the weekend.  So I have no idea what you just said.  I know you were getting big laughs from Anthony and Jimmy. 
[01:13:00]  Because he was up at Tar Beach, as they called it back in the 50s.  He got so much sun, and he's so sunburned that he's like, you know, sweating.  You ever get sun so bad you actually sweat the next day?  It's not sweat.  It's just oozing cancer.  It's oozing like lymphatic fluid.  Yeah, it's just oozing cancer.  Tom Chiasano somewhere just shaking his head going, don't they listen to me?  They never learn.  I just told them about my skin cancer last week.  You were on the rooftop of your building in Brooklyn. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Oh, that's smart.  It was only, what, 97 degrees in New York yesterday?  Grilling?  Yeah, we have the grill up on the top of the roof.  The grill is on the roof.  Oh, God.  What are you, the wedding scene in Raging Bull?  What were you making?  He's got sunburn under his chin.  How do you get sunburn under your chin?  Because it's probably reflecting off the roof.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm saying.  What kind of rooftop is it?  It's like white and tar.  Okay, yeah.  That's really smart.  It's the tar that's been, like, painted over white.  Yeah.  I used to go on, I used to have to do a lot of rooftop work. 
[01:14:00]  We put the big, giant, like, units for these big industrial buildings up there.  And on a sunny day, a lot of these rooftops are silver.  And no sunscreen or anything.  And it was like you were standing in a frying pan.  Giant silver roof just reflecting up.  And, yeah, like E-Rock, the bottom of your chin gets sunburned.  You have an all over.  Or were you nude?  No.  You're all red like you just got caught in the closet with another gentleman. 
[01:14:30]  I was just fixing his zipper.  You all right, though?  Yeah, it doesn't hurt.  It's just.  It's tight.  It's oozing something, though.  Does it feel tight?  Oh, look at.  Wow, let me see.  Look at his gut.  It's all red and, like.  Hey, wait a minute.  That sunburn's a little low, man.  What the hell were you wearing?  A banana hammock up there?  Did you have a little European thong on?  No.  Like Gary Glitter.  The marble bag that the guys.  Yo, Gary Glitter. 
[01:15:00]  That little thong bikini.  Wearing his thong bikini.  You show us white.  Where does it get white eventually?  All right.  Yeah, that's acceptable.  Jesus, you got really.  It's really red over your belt line.  Yeah.  That's got to hurt.  No, it doesn't hurt.  It just.  Can I slap it?  Oh, sure.  I'd love to apply lotion with a fly swatter.  We should make him wear a tweed shirt right now.  Something like rough.  I was down at the Jersey Shore and I just saw a horrific sight.  We're just all hanging out and there's this guy just really fat with one of those really tight beer bellies. 
[01:15:30]  You know what I mean?  It doesn't even jiggle.  It's just a tight.  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  It's the weirdest thing.  And everything else was, you know, he was a big guy to begin with.  But there's just tight, oversized belly and he's laying back and his kids are playing.  And his wife is applying lotion all over his belly for him.  Whoa.  It was horrific.  You can't do that himself? 
[01:16:00]  That's what I was thinking.  I mean, you know.  You get your chick to do your back.  Yeah.  You go, can you do my back?  I can't really reach.  And I don't want like one little area just with third degree burn.  And you get as much as you can.  Yeah, you do what you can, right?  And then you help each other out.  But this guy was just laying back, his arms behind his back, and she's just applying lotion  on this big, huge Buddha belly.  It was just awful.  You should have thrown sand on it.  There's nothing worse than grit in your lotion.  Grit on anything.  Grit. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, do I hate the beach?  The beach stinks.  I don't mind if I'm just going there to lay on the beach, go on the water, and leave.  Once you involve things like eating, there's a problem.  Because it doesn't matter how careful you are, you'll get that amplified 8 billion time  crunch of a grain of sand in your sandwich.  When was the last time you were at the beach, though?  Well, on vacation.  Oh, okay.  Go to Long Island beaches.  Are you insane?  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Freezing cold water, and little Puerto Rican kids with their nude. 
[01:17:00]  That's the throw them in the water.  You know something?  Dress your kids at the beach.  Buy them goddamn little swim trunks.  We don't want to see your little naked kids running around the beaches.  It's always Hispanic people.  I'm sorry.  I'm stereotyping, right?  Ooh.  How come it is?  Or their underwear.  Can't you just buy the kids some swim trunks?  Run around their underwear.  They're going to the bathroom. 
[01:17:30]  Or they run around in their diaper.  In their diaper.  And then they're bending in the water.  You don't even want to walk anywhere near where they are.  Oh, children.  Keep them to yourself.  Keep them out of public.  I went to the beach when I was in L.A. last time.  Over the November, December period.  January, we were shooting Louie with this girl I knew.  And we were hanging out.  I really liked her.  And she's like, let's go to the beach.  And I'm like, no.  And I'm like, dude, she's a nine and a half. 
[01:18:00]  And she wants you to go to the beach.  And I'm like, yeah, let's go.  So we drive to Venice.  We go to the beach.  And I'm wearing my Doc Martens and my stupid black jeans.  On the beach.  I didn't have anything.  She has a tiny bikini on, probably.  Walking in my socks.  And I went up blowing it.  Wow.  You're like Fonzie at the beach.  It's awful.  No, except when I hit the jukebox, no twins came over.  Six Latin gang members walked by and intimidated us.  Stole her from you.  It was awful.  She was kind of joking. 
[01:18:30]  She's like, this is kind of romantic.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah, but it wasn't me as a man.  It was, you know, eight-year-old Jimmy Norton just sitting there with the pretty man.  I should have just picked my nose and ate it and got it over with.  If she says that, then she kind of wants a little more.  Yeah, at that point, you've got to remove your shirt.  This is kind of romantic.  Remove that shirt, yeah.  Yeah, no, you don't.  Slow motion, the shirt comes off, stripped out, and realize that the purchase of the banana hammock was a good idea.  She looks at my breasts and realizes she's bi. 
[01:19:00]  No, I like her.  I just knew.  At least on the New York beaches, the only thing good about them is that people wear swim trunks or bathing suits.  When you go to some of the islands, you know, Aruba, things like that, it's guys from, you know, England and France, Europe, and they insist on wearing those things.  Oh, you don't want to – you turn your head and you go, oh, God. 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  I think you're forced not to look in that direction for a while.  You know what's funny?  They walk around like it's normal.  Yeah.  It's normal from where – from, you know, from where they're from, I guess, but not here.  Yeah, and they've got families there.  It's like, I don't know if I'd be too hip to my family seeing this guy walking around with that thing stuffed.  That old stuffed thing he's wearing.  Yuck.  Hey, moving on to other things.  Phil Mickelson.  Great job. 
[01:20:00]  Did you take a peek?  Good job.  What a joke.  Even if you're not a golf fan, it's too bad he didn't take a peek.  The greatest disaster in U.S. Open history.  Was it that bad?  Self-destructed.  Oh, was it that bad?  I don't watch golf.  He was so set up to win this.  He had two holes to go, and basically he just had to play –  Average.  Average.  Like he plays.  Yeah.  If he screwed up one hole and got a bogey, he was still going to win the damn thing.  Just don't completely self-destruct, and you win.  So on the 17th tee box, his drive lands in a garbage bag. 
[01:20:30]  In a garbage bag?  They got the garbage bag set up all over the course.  I was up there last week, you know, for the spectators.  You got your beer or whatever, and you throw your garbage in.  It's all on the fairways and all over the place.  It's just these little metal rims or whatever, and then there's a bag hanging.  Yeah.  His drive lands in a garbage bag.  Now he's like any Sunday afternoon, you know, hack.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  They have a picture of him in the paper today bending over looking for his ball in a garbage bag.  He's playing the U.S. Open.  What are the rules with that?  Out of bounds, I would gather.  No, no.  It wasn't out of bounds.  What's the ruling on a garbage bag?  It wasn't out of bounds.  You got to play it?  No, you get a free drop.  You get a free drop.  Yeah, because it's a man-made thing.  It was out of bounds markers, but this particular garbage bag wasn't out of bounds.  How could they put the bag there and not put it out of bounds?  It's off the fairway, and it's pretty far in the rough even because the spectators are walking around, you know, walking and following the golfers, and they got garbage. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, they wouldn't walk that far to throw it away.  So they try to keep it convenient for the spectators.  Okay.  So his drive lands in one of these garbage bags, and he's bending over looking for his ball.  He gets a free drop.  And then on the 18th hole, I heard this on the radio, by the way, so I still haven't seen the video, but his drive on 18, it hit what?  It hit like a hospitality tent.  On the radio, they said they can't even explain it.  They said they couldn't even explain how bad his drive was. 
[01:22:00]  Maybe Tom Chiasano could run down the hall and help me.  His drive was so incredibly bad.  It hit the roof of a merchandise stand or something, and it got a lucky bounce, so he still had a chance.  Still had a chance.  And then he just blows it on the 18th hole anyway.  Completely muffed it.  Is he known for being a choke artist?  He was for a few years there.  But lately, he's been winning.  But then he started winning, and they were starting to say, okay, he doesn't choke anymore, but now he has the greatest choke in U.S. Open history.  Was Greg Norman a big choke guy, too? 
[01:22:30]  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Yeah, I kind of remember that, him being a choker.  The shark.  The shack.  The shack.  I'm the shack, aye.  Are ya?  So, this guy, Oglevy, who, you know, he wins the U.S. Open.  He's an Aussie, I think, right?  And he was out of it, basically.  There's Tom.  Tom, what happened with that drive?  They said on the radio, they can't even explain it.  It hit, there's 36 holes at Wingfoot.  They use parallel fairways to set up these champion tents, and there's giant trees. 
[01:23:00]  It's beautiful.  So, he hit it all the way over the fairway, over the trees, bounced off the roof of this  champion's lounge, which is inflatable, because you could kind of hear it plunk off of it.  Boom.  This is the guy in the U.S. Open, by the way.  Yeah.  It's not me and you, you know, at Crab Meadows.  He's doing a happy Gilmore shot.  Like, oh, there goes my banana hook drive again.  Yeah.  And he's got a great bounce off of it, bounces back into this trampled down, which is in play.  I mean, because it's just not far enough away for it to be out of bounds. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  And then just, you know.  And then chokes.  Just.  Absolutely chokes.  Because he.  He's still, if he gets a bogey in the last hole, he goes to a playoff.  He's playing today, right.  They would play an 18-hole playoff today.  Wow.  And he gets double bogey on 18.  What's that mean?  And all he had to do was just keep it in play on 18.  All he had to do, they're saying, why did he even pull out the driver?  Right.  Just keep it in play with a, you know, a wood or something.  He had a four, didn't have a three-wood, had a four-wood in the bag, you know, hit the four.  I mean, this is, you know, his style is, it's an all, it's a go-for-it style. 
[01:24:00]  So he played the way he's most comfortable, but it was really bad.  It was, I watched the whole thing, and I really went from thinking, I want this guy to win to,  God, please lose already.  You know?  It was painful.  You deserve to lose.  Listen, I've been there, and it's just, not that kind of competition, but my own.  And it's just, you lose, you lose your senses.  You lose your direction.  But his drive on the 17th landed in the garbage bag, right? 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  The picture in the paper is hilarious.  He wasn't happy with himself.  Like I said, any hack golfer out there trying to find their ball in a garbage pail.  It looks like he's not a guy.  Yeah, not a guy playing in the U.S. Open.  I actually thought he was getting sick in the garbage bag.  No, he's looking for his golf ball, and it actually landed in there.  Yeah, I'm sure he felt that.  Yeah, he's bent over at the waist.  Looks like he's puking into a garbage bag.  What a fool on national television to rifle through the garbage.  He had a complete breakdown.  Yeah, absolutely.  Him and the Scotsman, Montgomery. 
[01:25:00]  Montgomery has, this was his, I think his fourth or fifth second place finish in a major.  Yeah.  And, I mean, he should have, could have won, too.  Yeah, he gets a double bogey on 18.  Oh.  Like, they all collapsed.  This Oglevy was, he was pretty much out of it.  Yeah.  He had to chip in in 17 and still be in it, and he did, which was crazy in itself.  And then Colin Montgomery broke down, and then Phil Mickelson broke down.  And then Oglevy walks away with it when he wasn't even supposed to win at that point.  Tiger Woods ever choked like that?  What?  It's the first time ever he missed the cut. 
[01:25:30]  After 39, 39 in a row.  59.  Oh, 59?  I think it's 59.  59.  Is that the record?  It tied the record.  It tied the record.  It tied with Jack Nicklaus.  And he didn't make it, so he didn't even play yesterday.  No, he was 12 over after two days.  But it's the first time he's playing after his father died, so nine weeks.  Yeah.  And I don't think he really wanted to play on Father's Day anyway.  I think he would have been just walking around the golf course going,  Oh, God.  Oh, that horrible.  Well, think about it. 
[01:26:00]  Well, you know what?  He was brought up on a golf course where his dad,  he's going to play Father's Day after his dad dies.  But Nike produced those commercials.  Those were nice spots.  Very nice spots.  But it was all his, you know, so all the footage of him and his father,  mostly the footage of him and his father.  So, I mean, to his credit, he let that happen.  Right.  Yeah, that's got to affect you, though.  Well, I mean, it's the day before Father's Day, a couple of days before Father's Day,  and you're trying to play golf.  His father's dead for 60 days.  Yeah, just a few days. 
[01:26:30]  Maybe he just looked at that woman he's married to and said,  I'd rather bang her than put this stupid ball around.  Why am I wasting time?  Pencil in some sex for Sunday.  I had a moment up there, though.  You know, I had a moment up there.  I went to Thursday's play, and afterwards, I'm actually at the XM booth.  They're right off the punting green.  And Tiger had a horrendous round.  He was six over, and we're hanging out there, getting ready to board the bus and go home.  And all of a sudden, there's a few golfers on the putting green,  no one you really care about.  And then all of a sudden, Tiger walks out with his coach, 
[01:27:00]  and he's just putting like 20 feet in front of me.  And I'm thinking, this has got one of the most famous people in all of the world,  and he's right there.  And it was cool just checking him out, you know, practicing with his coach,  doing exactly what we all do when we play golf,  throw three balls down and try to make one in the –  I'm sure it's not exactly what I do.  But it's the exact same routine that we all do.  Yeah.  You know, just throw three down.  Ah, I missed that one a little left.  I've got to aim a little right.  You know, it's the same crap.  You could have told a racist joke really loud that elbowed your friend. 
[01:27:30]  But the sun was going down.  He hears him in the clubhouse.  It's perfect.  It was like a commercial, actually.  The sun's going down, and there he is just putting at the end of a really bad day of golf on the course.  The other people were way back because they had the ropes up,  and I was lucky enough to have some behind-the-scenes access.  Did you say good luck, bro?  Good luck, bro.  No, as he's walking off.  He's a big dude, though, right?  I mean, he's in shape.  He's jacked.  Yeah, he's absolutely jacked.  Someone's telling me on the course that he bench presses like 400 pounds.  I don't know if that's true.  He's a big jack. 
[01:28:00]  He's a jack, man.  I don't remember.  I've only met him once.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, Jimmy.  I don't know.  It's usually –  Jimmy's met everybody.  Right.  Well, here's the audio of Phil Mickelson after he just had the biggest collapse in his open history.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tom?  So here's the audio of –  You got him really bad.  Oh, God.  I had to be mailed him.  Oh, you looked?  What are you, crazy?  I kind of looked up a little bit.  Did he come back in?  Yeah, he did.  It was just really uncomfortable for everybody. 
[01:28:30]  30 seconds.  That will always make me happy.  It is really funny.  So Phil Mickelson, he talked to the press afterwards.  The biggest collapse in U.S. Open history.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  I still am in shock that I did that.  I just can't believe that I did that.  I am such an idiot.  This one hurts more than any tournament because, you know, I had it won.  I think the biggest reason why this is so disappointing is that this is a tournament that I dreamt of winning as a kid. 
[01:29:00]  But I spent hours practicing.  I mean, days, countless hours practicing.  Oops.  Dreaming of winning this tournament.  Came out here weeks and months in advance to get ready and had it right there in my hand, man.  It was just right there.  And I let it go.  And it's – I just cannot believe I did that.  I don't like the way he kept changing his times, like minutes, hours, weeks, months.  I don't know if he could have been.  He doesn't even know what he's saying.  He's a 30.  He's just in another place. 
[01:29:30]  I smell a new clip in there, though, that I need on my instant replay for when E-Rock screws up.  I'm an idiot.  The beginning of that one, yeah.  I don't know what happened.  I'm an idiot.  I'm an idiot.  Well, look, he's not even smiling.  No, he's busy.  He's writing something.  He's actually writing it down.  Eric's a busy boy.  Hopefully, somebody, please get me something.  My face is on fire.  A little kid sunburn.  Yeah.  What does that note say?  Please get me aloe.  Right from the plant.  That awful gut. 
[01:30:00]  Just throw aloe plants at him.  I like to bull with his stomach like in a dirty, rotten scoundrel with an electrical cord.  Just that kind of fat, stretched gut.  You know if you smacked it with something like an extension cord, it would turn completely white where it hit.  And then really deep red and hurt very badly.  You know what you should make him wear?  Like a tight army wool sweater.  A tight sweater.  Turtleneck.  And then wrestle with him and rough him up.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[01:30:30]  How about that's the wrestling part?  It's uncomfortable for everyone.  Yeah.  Your face is like...  Burnt up.  It's glowing.  It's so red.  Maybe something is leaking something.  Don't you have parks where you...  Like there are Brooklyn parks where you live?  Across Shore Road or something?  By the river?  Mike, sweetie.  Yeah.  Couldn't you have barbecue there?  Yeah, we could have, but...  It's like...  What do we listen to?  Up on the roof. 
[01:31:00]  Ta beach.  Ta beach.  The roof is not better.  It is.  People you got to deal with at the beach.  You want to deal with that crap?  You want your own little people.  I know exactly why you did it.  No, you go to the park.  Point to the melanin, son.  I know why you did it.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  We'll get some aloe for E-Rock.  He's from Florida.  How does his skin have no...  You're like a Seattle boy.  I'm from Long Island.  I'm from...  What?  From Long Island.  Your family's from Florida, aren't they?  No.  You're from all over the place.  Oh, I didn't know that.  We can't keep track of the E-Rock clan. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  It's like punch sound, women scream, opium anthem.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out this morning. 
[01:32:00]  Excuse me.  I'm a little annoyed.  We'll get into it in a second.  But I wanted to congratulate Jim Norton here on rave reviews about Lucky Louie last night  on HBO.  I can't stay up that late.  I got a little DVR action.  I'm going to see it after the show today.  That's what I did.  I'll give you one hint.  It's a good episode, and Louie is very briefly nudinous.  His body, it's abominable how he looks without clothing. 
[01:32:30]  Full nudity.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't even want to see that.  It's a quick shot, but it's atrocious.  He's atrocious naked.  And what is he doing naked?  He's in bed, and he's hopping over his wife to get out of bed.  Dumpy, awful physique.  He makes Bob Kelly look like he has washboard abs in a V.  A disgrace, man.  Is it awkward, him getting out of bed?  Like, is there a lot of, like, because if he's crawling over someone, doesn't that mean 
[01:33:00]  that you've got to kind of straddle a little bit, and certain areas of your body are exposed?  Well, maybe if you have a Hubble telescope, because I don't know how cold it was in the  studio that day.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Louie's, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Not flattering as far as him being a man.  It's exactly what you look like making at home an awful disaster.  All of a sudden, he's naked.  I got the audio. 
[01:33:30]  Here it is.  He gets naked, and this is what happened.  I don't doubt it.  It's Lucky Louie on HBO every Sunday night at 9.30.  Definitely check it out, Jim.  10.30.  10.30.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, 9.30 on one of the other coasts.  No, that's right.  Yeah, 10.30 on HBO.  Why am I thinking 9.30?  Entourage is on at 10 or 9?  Entourage is 10.  Deadwood's 9.  Entourage 10.  We're 10.30.  I'm all screwed up today.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Lucky Louie, 10.30 on HBO every Sunday night.  Okay.  Well, you want to hear how dumb lawyers are? 
[01:34:00]  I just got the word from Ben that we could play part of the audio from the incident, from  the situation, Anthony.  The situation.  The audio's on the internet all over the place.  Just freaking do a little surfing and you'll find it.  If you're just tuning in, basically after this show, we do a walkover to XM that is broadcast  on XM exclusively.  And we got into a situation on Friday with a Stern fan and we took care of the situation  big time.  Big time.  And the audio's unbelievable. 
[01:34:30]  It really is.  So the stupid lawyers got their hands on the audio to figure out what we could play.  What we could play.  And they have decided, because we don't want to get, we don't want to explain all over again.  After much meeting.  They decided we could play the audio up to the part where Anthony says, yeah, we're stealing  all of Howard's stations.  And then there's a big laugh.  Uh-huh.  And that's it.  We can't play any more of the audio.  Why the hell would we play that? 
[01:35:00]  Oh my God.  I had to stop myself there because I wanted to say the F word, by the way.  That's why it sounded a little weird.  I had to like, get a different thing in there.  Very hard.  Why would they even present that to us?  Why would the lawyers say, yeah, you can play it up to there and then that is it and  that should be good for you guys?  Because they're dummies and none of them are creative and they do things to justify their  own existence under the guise of radio.  And I'll tell you why the lawyers are really stupid.  It proves they don't know radio.  Why would we accept that deal? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Why would we ever, don't even tell us that we can play it up to that.  Guys, I want you to play the scene right up until Michael goes into the bathroom.  That's it.  Because after.  Grab the gun from behind the toilet.  That's all.  Right.  Nothing more.  Right.  That's exactly how it would be.  What?  Because all hell breaks loose after Anthony's really funny line that sets up the whole thing  because the guy obviously had nothing else and felt like he had to do something.  How's the Italian food here?  Cut.  Just keep the lawyers away from us. 
[01:36:00]  I don't even want to deal with them.  Play it right up to Lou's U-turn.  Yeah, exactly.  Going to Jersey?  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.  How stupid are you?  God, can we name, can we say they're stupid names just to show you that we have these dumb  lawyers?  I want to see Don Corleone pick out an apple and then cut.  Two guys are walking towards, stop it there.  Perfect.  Stop.  Enough.  But what happened?  I don't care what happened.  Don't show the rest.  They actually said that, though. 
[01:36:30]  We can play the audio right up to the point where Anthony...  As far as you know, Carlo is in Vegas.  They sent him out to the car with the tickets.  He went to Vegas.  Never see him again, but...  I want lades.  That's lawyer aids.  Every time you open a briefcase, you rapidly lose weight, you crushing boars.  And then I have to see these lawyers face-to-face.  I'm like, oh, we're big fans.  We listen every day.  Stop listening.  And quit the radio business.  You don't know what the hell's going on. 
[01:37:00]  Heck.  Heck.  Go use your lawyer crap somewhere else.  Heck.  God, we work with people that don't know radio.  Why would you present that to us?  Why would you say, yeah, here, guys, good news.  You can play the audio right up to the point where Anthony says we're taking all of Howard  stations.  Big laugh.  Cut.  Why would we do that?  It's kind of...  It's not an incident or a situation to that point, really.  No.  Just a little, you know, fun and good-natured ribbing. 
[01:37:30]  Can't we play the situation after that without playing before that?  What about that?  What about we just play the action part?  And they wonder why we hate him so much.  Because you don't know radio.  Wow.  You don't know radio.  You're making it...  That's a bit of a religious background, but...  No, you're making it harder for us to succeed in this thing.  Oh, because that's real interesting.  That's real interesting to play that.  We should play it. 
[01:38:00]  We should play it up to that point now.  Just to show you how ridiculous it would sound.  Listen, Al, you might have to dump out of this.  I don't care.  Lawyers are pains in the backside.  Oh, hey, hey.  Do we have the audio?  Because now I want to make the lawyers look silly.  Oh, that's what it'll do.  That's what it'll do.  Do we have it up to that point?  And then I'll forget to push stop, and we'll just keep playing it.  Let's say hi to Brian in North Carolina.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, boys. 
[01:38:30]  Sonny pulls up to the toll booth, and cut.  Yeah, exactly.  Cut.  Oh, he wants to have an easy pass.  I guess that's the end of the move.  That's it.  The gate went up.  He drove, went down.  Good news, guys.  You can play the audio up to this point.  Yeah.  Hello, Carlo.  Great.  Great.  Thanks.  And here you are.  President Kennedy's car is making the turn.  The motorcade is working its way down.  Cut.  We'll be back.  He must have went on to the trademark and made a speech. 
[01:39:00]  Exactly.  Here comes the Hindenburg.  It's wonderful.  Coming into Lakehurst, New Jersey.  It's mooring lines are coming down, and I have to go.  Oh, it must have docked, and all the Nazis got off, and everything's fine.  Minutes high, minutes far.  Cut.  Back to back, and...  I wish he'd do that. 
[01:39:30]  So do I.  What goes on in their brains down there?  Nothing.  It's pure legal mumbo-jumbo.  You'd think they actually handed it to Eric Logan, like, good news, look.  We've decided.  We can play this.  And what was the decision-making?  Go screw.  Go jump in a lake.  What was the decision-making?  Like, why did they pick that as the jumping-off point?  Because they're...  They're sitting there with their briefcases.  I believe this part here can be played. 
[01:40:00]  But if we go...  Now there's some sort of issue.  And then all of a sudden it'll be like,  I don't know what's going on with Opie and Anthony.  They're not getting as many subs for us as we thought they would.  I don't really know why.  Because you don't know how to do radio.  Get out of our effing way.  Silly lawyers.  The stupid audio's out there already.  Do you get it?  So we're going to play an edited version?  We're going to look like complete asses.  Go work for a morning zoo.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Silly lawyers.  More your speed.  Or hang out with Bob Edwards more.  That guy's cool.  Hey.  Let's say hi to Neil in New York.  You say a bad thing about Bob Edwards.  Neil.  I love that ghoul.  Yeah.  All right.  He's not up at this hour anyway.  Hold on.  This guy's defending lawyers?  All right.  I'm in their right mind with defend a lawyer ever.  Rob.  Rob for the defense.  That's right.  Hey, guys.  Well, I'm not so much defending the lawyers,  but I love comparing yourselves to this little bit with a stupid Howard fan. 
[01:41:00]  Everyone knows you guys are better anyway.  But I love comparing that to the godfather.  I mean, talk about making it extreme.  And, you know, obviously the lawyers understand the radio.  I mean, they may be idiots.  Hold on.  I will not accept that.  Lawyers are the worst things to happen to radio.  Trust me.  Yeah, they really don't get it.  Trust me.  Let me tell you a quick little story.  Hold on.  Let me tell you a quick little story.  I was doing radio in Rochester.  I was just a nobody.  And I was watching what Brother Weez was doing and learning a lot.  And I was like just a part-timer. 
[01:41:30]  And there was a GM up there.  His name was Pete Coughlin.  He ran WCMF in Rochester.  Okay.  And another rock station came to town.  And they were kind of owned by these two douchebags called the Velcro Brothers.  That was their nickname.  Okay.  They drove identical sports cars.  And they had really nice suits.  And they were going to set the radio world on fire in Rochester.  And they were attempting to take the audience away from WCMF at the time. 
[01:42:00]  And there was this bar that all the media went to.  And we went there every afternoon after we were done with work to do a little drinking,  a little happy hour.  And Pete Coughlin would set up shop at this bar and buy drinks for the entire staff or  whoever would show up from WCMF.  Right?  And the regulars were there.  We're drinking and stuff.  The Velcro Brothers are there.  Pete's like Pete under his teeth is like those son of a bitches.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe they're in this bar.  Right?  So the Velcro Brothers, they buy us shots. 
[01:42:30]  And they push them over to the bar.  Right?  The bartender is like shots from the Velcro Brothers.  Well, whatever their real names were.  Right?  So Pete Coughlin looks at all of us and goes, if any one of you drink that shot, you're  fired.  You're fired.  And then proceeds to go over there with his shot.  And the guys are like all smiling like, oh, look, we're going to do a little clink and  a little friendly shot together because we're competing in radio.  Pete threw it in his face and a brawl basically breaks out.  Well, those Velcro Brothers are inseparable. 
[01:43:00]  So, of course, they've got to stick up for each other.  Hey, they're fuzz.  This is fuzz.  Inseparable.  But this was the guy that was running the radio station.  He was the one starting the S.  He was the one starting.  Now, fast forward a mere 15 or some odd years later and you've got lawyers making sure  nothing gets out of hand.  Yeah.  Well, you knew the Velcro Brothers were about to fight when they would go.  The 1-1 to Mookie Wilson.  It's a ground ball up the first baseline. 
[01:43:30]  Listen, I know you have.  I wonder what happened.  I guess Billy caught it.  Threw it.  Yep.  That's it.  Yeah.  Came over.  But how are you defending lawyers, Rob?  Go ahead.  Go.  Thanks, Paul.  I was just defending him in the sense that you know how bad it is with the FCC.  These guys are trying to keep you on the radio, as you know.  I don't need to tell you that.  And all I'm saying is, as a fan, Jimmy Norton is one of the absolute best comedians out  there.  He's dirty and scary as he can be.  You're missing.  You don't condescend to the listeners. 
[01:44:00]  Rob, you're missing the point, though.  We don't play it then.  It shouldn't have been an option where they even go, well, you can play it up to this point.  The lawyers are trying to keep...  I understand that, but I don't think that they think that makes good radio.  The lawyers are trying to do what?  Keep us on the radio?  Nothing's going to happen.  The audio's already out there.  Whatever's going to happen is going to happen.  People are finding the audio as we do this show, by the way.  I believe that nothing will happen, you guys.  If it is really risky, you should take the risk.  They're overreacting.  So just play it. 
[01:44:30]  They're overreacting, because they'll fire us.  That's the problem.  I would love to say that we're tough guys, but the fact is, if we play the audio, I guarantee  we'll get fired.  Okay?  Yeah, well, that's silly, but I understand.  Tranquility base, the eagle.  Let's go to Johnny.  One small step for man.  It's all we can play.  It's all we can play.  Yeah, they didn't say humankind.  That's not all-inclusive. 
[01:45:00]  It's all you can play on satellite radio, where everything's supposed to be uncensored.  Yeah, brilliant.  That's brilliant, lawyers.  I hate them.  Don't even come up to New York anymore.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Luke, I am your cut, cut.  Yeah, exactly.  The only thing we have to fear is...  Yeah, that speech would have never been made if it...  What have we got to fear?  If they had to, you know, let a lawyer look at the speech first.  Let's cut this part out. 
[01:45:30]  Lawyers stink.  There is some stuff to fear.  If we say that and someone fears something, then they're going to say that we said there  was only this to fear.  There's...  There could be a problem, so...  Do we got the audio?  Because now I got to play it to make them look stupid.  Please.  We don't have it?  Does E-Rock...  No one has it.  Why would we have the audio here?  Why?  It was only one of the biggest things that has happened on our show in the last two years. 
[01:46:00]  The audio's at XM.  Why would we have it here?  It's under lock and key.  Why wouldn't we have a coffee over here?  Oh, God.  What, of the audio that we can't play?  But why wouldn't we have it here just in case?  Let me think.  Why wouldn't we have it here?  Maybe they knew it would be too tempting to throw into the machine.  No, it's not...  Why?  Mike, you asked yesterday.  I sent you an email saying you're making sure that you want... 
[01:46:30]  You just bring it over.  I didn't bring it over.  We ain't going to play some conglomerated, mulatto, mongrel version of that audio.  By God.  Let's go to Neil in New York.  Neil, what's up?  Yeah, all right, guys.  I totally agree.  It's full of bollocks.  You have to put up with that.  It'll suck.  You lot threw the World Cup, well, on Saturday.  That game between Italy and America. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, it was a good game, man.  You got to have a voice like yours to enjoy the World Cup.  You understand that, right?  No, that's rubbish, man.  You got to get into this.  Really, really.  You lot have a really good team.  It's a world-class team.  What?  You lot have a world-class team, man.  I mean, they had a bad game.  Yeah, that first game, it was a bad game against Czechoslovakia.  But honestly, I was shocked as to how good you lot play.  You know what?  The World Cup's going to be done in, what, another week or two, and then we go back to  not caring at all. 
[01:47:30]  Wait, did the U.S. win?  Right now, maybe 2% of the country cares.  What happened?  No, that's not true.  What happened?  We talked about it.  A lot of people are really into this sport.  I mean, in America, and it's frustrating.  Yeah, if you talk like you, you love the World Cup.  Did America win a game?  I honestly don't know.  They tied.  They tied.  I did see the highlights.  I do watch SportsCenter.  You know how much I care?  Nil.  I care nil.  And it's zero, pal.  It's zero or nothing.  That's what you say.  Hey, what's the game?  It's three-nothing.  Not three-nil. 
[01:48:00]  It's nil.  Nothing.  Nil doesn't exist in America.  It's zero.  Zed.  Or nothing.  Four.  Nothing.  Nada.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I played some Mexicans last night in Central Park.  And I went in there thinking, yeah, you know.  And I walked off that pitch 45 years later.  What happened with the game with the Mexicans?  Was it?  I want to know.  No, yeah.  Boring.  Was it like goals being scored? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, it was goals being scored, Jimmy.  Boring.  I could go on every night, mate.  Boring.  Oh, they were playing soccer?  Boring.  I thought it was a fence-scaling competition.  Boring.  Boring.  River swimming.  You're all wankers.  You know that.  Wankers.  I guess the U.S. tied, right?  But we got to win.  Yeah, but still.  We got to win our next game to move on.  Your accent.  You got to win, I think, by, unfortunately, and this is a sad part, I think you got to win by, like, five goals or something.  Your accent doesn't quite sound legit. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  I think he's real.  I'm not buying the accent.  All right.  Thank you, Neil.  All right.  Cheers, Elijah.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Whatever.  I wasn't buying it.  I don't know.  It might be kind of like English.  Maybe he's been here a few years.  Maybe he's been over here.  He travels.  He's gay.  Speaking of the World Cup, we did Homeless Radio again recently, and Tibby Tom discussed the World Cup.  Well, thank goodness.  Basically, the bit is over at XM, because we've got time to fill.  We leave early from time to time, and we let Homeless guys just do a radio show with the help of Fan just trying to keep things going. 
[01:49:30]  But besides that, it's all Homeless Radio doing their thing.  And someone asked a question about the World Cup.  What about the World Cup in general?  You like soccer?  Excited?  Oh, my cousin is a good soccer player.  Of course.  I don't know who's up.  I ain't cap up with it.  But if you were to have a favorite team, who do you think it would be?  The soccer teams? 
[01:50:00]  Favorite World Cup team?  Well, there's many of them.  I'm not a real soccer player.  I'm more baseball.  Okay.  What about the U.S. team?  Do you like them?  Yankees, man.  Yankees?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hit another controversial.  Yankees ain't baseball.  You're totally right. 
[01:50:30]  Yankees ain't baseball.  Not lately.  Jesus.  All right.  We'll go to break with more Homeless Radio.  They talk about gay marriage here.  Dude, you can't play this tippy-tompson.  He sounds drunk.  Yeah, the lawyers will shut this down, too.  Too controversial, guys.  Too controversial.  Ask not.  What's your country?  I was going to stop it somewhere else, see?  I thought that was the joke. 
[01:51:00]  Enough of a delay?  I think there was.  You are brilliant, my friend.  You are brilliant.  All right.  A little more Homeless Radio as we go to break.  They discuss gay marriage.  It should be known that tippy-tom, our homeless friend, is gay and has AIDS and loves to drink.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, tippy-tom.  I'll keep it easy on you.  What do you feel about gay marriage and the president on that?  The president of who?  Do you think men should be able to marry other men legally? 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  I'm off for it.  If you fall in love with somebody, that's fair with me.  I don't care.  It's your business.  If you fall in love with a man, go right ahead.  If you fall in love with a woman, two women, it's okay with two women?  All right.  Well, two men, if you fall in love with somebody, why not? 
[01:52:00]  All right.  Blue, you kind of laughed there.  What do you think about men marrying other men?  Well, I'm going to tell you like this.  This is big blue.  I'm a hellosexual or bisexual.  All right.  Just like what tippy-tom said, if you have a lover, you fall in love with him, go with it.  Doesn't matter what gender.  I'm kidding.  Opie and Anthony, these guys thrash. 
[01:52:30]  Hard.  Come on!  No.  Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony!  Holy crap.  Are you kidding me?  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  That's insane. 
[01:53:00]  I am losing my mind in front of everybody.  What's with the bagpipes?  I don't know.  What is this?  I don't know.  I knew it was going to rock eventually, but...  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  1-866-313-FREE.  Corn?  This is corn, right?  Okay.  Is this new?  Or am I just an ass?  Isn't that a trick question for you?  Is this new or am I an ass?  Call me an ass.  Please leave the option C.  And I'm reading this.  I have no idea. 
[01:53:30]  It's chutes and ladders, I think.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I'm annoyed at everybody.  I just want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  The lawyers are driving me nuts.  The people that work for us, I swear to God, are driving me to the point I'm going to go insane.  People need to be fired, and it's not a radio bit.  Oh, boy.  We need to fire people and wake people up.  Because I'm hearing behind the scenes, oh, we're underpaid, blah, blah, blah.  And then they don't even do the basics, and they want me to go to bat for them to get them more money.  Go F yourself. 
[01:54:00]  If you think you're underpaid and you work for this show, then go try to find another job that pays you more.  And then come back to us with how much more you're going to make, and then we'll decide if it's worth matching that salary.  That's how it works.  That's how I made more money in this business.  That's how Anthony made more money in this business.  Enough with the underpaid crap.  You're talking the Ron Bennington School of Staffing.  That's how Ronnie does it.  It's how it's done everywhere.  These guys...  Ronnie purges his audience...  His audience.  Ronnie purges his staff. 
[01:54:30]  Once every six months, someone's got to go.  Twice a year, him and Fez, you show up with a hazmat suit.  That's it.  Just wipes everybody out.  Hoses down the place.  A new crop comes in.  But that's how it works in the real world.  And these people, they get into little chatter sessions off in corners going, we're all underpaid.  Then go find a job that'll pay you more.  That's how it works in America.  This show has rolled on for many, many years with many, many different players behind the scenes. 
[01:55:00]  You know, now I'm finding out Ben left already because he's paranoid what's going to happen to him on the walk.  So he's just left the show.  That was ridiculous.  He's the executive producer of the show.  He's already left.  He's already left the fuck...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's so hard.  It's so hard to not say I'm naughty.  I can't be at 840 already.  To say I'm naughty.  Yeah, sometimes it's...  Ben figured because of what happened Friday, he wasn't going to do the walk with us today.  Why?  Well, big surprise. 
[01:55:30]  He's paranoid.  I wonder why.  Boy, I wonder why.  What could make people paranoid?  Who knows?  I used to get paranoid sometime in the 80s.  It's like the mid-80s.  It was always after something.  Can't quite remember what it was, though.  I got paranoid January 31st of 87.  I haven't been paranoid since.  It used to cost me money to get paranoid.  Exactly.  I used to do something and get paranoid and then want to buy more. 
[01:56:00]  Then chew my mouth and play chess and eat Edelman cookies and drink gin and throw up.  Look out the window for police.  So this was a rumor, but now we got Club Soda Kennedy.  What's the deal with Ben?  Really?  He's an idiot.  Really?  What's the deal with Ben?  Ben went back to the XM office just to keep it on the down low for the walk.  When did he leave?  Just a few minutes ago.  Did he send a decoy Ben out first and then go down different streets? 
[01:56:30]  A decoy Ben.  Someone with cerebral palsy and a bad wig.  A herky-jerky balloon.  Tell Ben.  Parkinson's and a chicken on his head.  Tell Ben, just stay out of my way.  I don't even want to see him over there.  I'm not even kidding.  Call ahead.  I'm sure he heard it, Rose.  Call ahead.  Oh, boy.  Because it's ridiculous that he...  Oh, he's worried about what's going to happen?  Call ahead.  A big fat head.  He's worried about what's going to happen on the walkover. 
[01:57:00]  What about the rest of us?  We're all a little wondering what's going to happen on the walkover today, but we're not running away.  I don't know.  He didn't want the scrutiny from the fans.  I don't know what he expected.  Scrutiny?  Sometimes you go down there, there's a nice crowd.  Sometimes there are three people.  Let's be honest here.  What's scrutiny from the crowd has been...  What?  Well, everyone's saying...  I have the CD of the audio.  I came over to get it.  I just wanted...  I had to make sure it was that, you know, it was the right CD. 
[01:57:30]  So, everyone's saying...  The audio from Friday.  I'm bringing it...  But everyone's saying you went over there because you were worried about the walkover.  I got the CD.  I'm coming back.  Ah, that wasn't an answer to that.  That meant, yeah, I was.  But now I figure I'll come back.  Well, because that's the other problem.  We're like, well, now we want to play the audio, and I look around, and we don't even have it here.  And then they weren't even going to get it.  Because we want to now play the lawyer-friendly version of the incident before we get out of here to show you how dumb and stupid they are down there. 
[01:58:00]  There's no way to...  And then I just checked my BlackBerry, and Eric Logan is emailing me.  Yeah.  But now it's in bold, dark type.  Oh, good.  Then you could recognize it as something important.  Yeah, so his email pops out at you, and it just says, you know, good news, you can play the audio.  Wait, wait, wait.  Here it is.  I don't want to put words in his mouth.  Hold on a minute.  In his BlackBerry.  Here it is.  Call me.  You can play up to a point.  You can play up to a point. 
[01:58:30]  You can play the audio up to a point.  Like, that's exciting news.  Yeah.  Unless the point is the end.  We get to play up to the point.  Right up to the point where it gets interesting.  And then cut.  And that's good news for who?  For who?  For nobody.  For who?  I just, I just want to go home.  I want to go home today.  I just want to go home.  You can't go home.  I just want to go home.  I understand. 
[01:59:00]  But there's no going home anymore.  We did that when we were immature radio broadcasters.  We are professionals now.  There's no going home.  Photo tours and death plunge.  Yellowstone National Park.  I've done this, by the way.  Oh, cute story.  And many people have done this, but, well, this lady loses.  She loses big time.  A woman lost her footing after stepping over a retaining wall to take a photograph.  Being shoved by her husband.  Where did that happen?  Oh, Yellowstone.  Ramone! 
[01:59:30]  Bring me a woman with butter on her feet.  Old butter feet.  All right, let me, uh, let me.  Oh, God.  Let me try this again.  The headline is Photo Tours and Death Plunge.  Ah.  Yellowstone National Park.  What happened?  I think you asked.  Yellowstone National Park.  A woman lost her footing after stepping over a retaining wall to take a photograph and went over a cliff, falling 500 feet to her death. 
[02:00:00]  It's not that far.  That's a 50-story building.  How good a picture do you need, bitch?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a 50-story building.  You know what?  Wow.  And I was just thinking, I've done this as well at the Grand Canyon.  You climb over the wall to get a cooler shot, like, on the edge.  I got pictures of me right on the edge of the Grand Canyon.  You don't need that picture.  But now I'm thinking, why would you do that?  Because how much closer could you get to something by stepping over the rail? 
[02:00:30]  Like, people step over the rail up there in Niagara Falls to get closer to the falls.  What, you're getting a mere three feet, four, whatever, ten feet closer?  Yeah, and the whole scheme of the hugeness of it, that means nothing.  It means nothing is right.  I hope she was snapping all the way down.  Oh.  Ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Just looking like the coyote.  You got to snap all the way down.  Getting smaller and smaller.  Poof.  The father was grieving.  He was running around.  It sounded like he was crying, but it kind of came up as yippee-i-ay. 
[02:01:00]  It does sound suspicious.  Was the husband there?  And her sons, yeah.  Deb Chamberlain, 52, vice president of the school board in Rockford, Michigan.  She should have known better.  Was visiting the park with her husband and two children.  A motorist called 911 after the Saturday morning accident at a Yellowstone River overlook.  A ranger repelled down the canyon wall, but Chamberlain was dead at the scene.  Well, he had to repel down, because she might have been fine after a 500-foot plummet.  500 feet. 
[02:01:30]  That's time to go, oops, I really screwed up.  He went down there with a soup spoon and a bag to see if she was okay.  Wow.  Yeah, 500 feet's a long way down.  You run it up, you have to yell, like, ahhh!  Ahhh!  Yeah, there's been a couple of these falls that have happened.  Is this the edited version? 
[02:02:00]  A little suspicious.  This is what we can play, officially, from the lawyers.  That's it.  That's what we can play.  All right.  Those darn lawyers.  Wait, wait.  Please, please, God, please, if you're listening, make the CD not work.  Why?  Make the...  Why?  You have to ask why?  Why?  Why?  Because I want to see you choke somebody.  Why?  Please, God, let him hit play and have nothing on this CD. 
[02:02:30]  Or let it be the wrong stuff from the wrong cell.  Just something wrong.  Please let it be one of my plugs from, like, six months ago.  I want to see Ben take the exact fall that woman did out of this window.  Well, you know, her husband would probably go, no, no, no, over a little bit more.  Yeah, more.  Back, back.  It's a picture of a lifetime, honey.  Sometimes you've got to show people how ridiculous others are.  And this is one of those moments.  I don't want to play this. 
[02:03:00]  I'm not...  The only reason we're playing this today is to show you how ridiculous the lawyers are behind the scenes  and other people that are involved in this situation that happened on Friday.  How about let's frustrate our audience as much as we are frustrated by not being able to play it.  They can hear it up to the point, and then how frustrating it is to not hear the rest of it.  See, they're running around Washington like, good news, we can play...  Some of the audio has been cleared to play.  No, this is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  I can't believe I actually worked for the same company as these dopes. 
[02:03:30]  Whew.  Start...  Take a radio course or something.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  If the board of directors are listening at XM...  Wolves.  Get the lawyers enrolled in the Connecticut School of Broadcasting so they know the basics of radio  before they start influencing our radio show.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk Mick friend.  Oh, he must have just had dinner and left.  Anthony, you want to set up the incident?  Now, remember, this audio was played already, so it's out there. 
[02:04:00]  It was played three or four times on Friday.  I don't remember.  I know we played at least two other times.  Yes.  Maybe three.  I would say we played it four times on Friday.  Four.  It's all over the internet.  Yeah.  All over the place.  Yeah.  But now the lawyers have decided that we can play this much of the audio.  Yeah.  We do the walkover from this studio to the XM studio after this show.  We have microphones.  We walk over, and whatever happens, we broadcast it.  Sometimes a lot of stuff happens.  Sometimes nothing happens.  It's just the walk.  Broadcast live. 
[02:04:30]  On this occasion, we met a guy that had a big Opie and Anthony sign that's going up in  the subway.  We stopped to talk to him.  Jackass came over.  Obviously a Stern fan trying to disrupt the show, but instead of that, we gave him the  mic.  Let him talk, because they usually wind up having nothing and hanging themselves, and that's  what this guy did.  He had nothing.  He was then berated, got a little angry, put his hands on executive producer Ben Sparks,  was immediately taken down by Master Poe, putting a submission hold on the sidewalk.  There's a lot of screaming and yelling. 
[02:05:00]  A lot of screaming and yelling.  Anthony and I getting in the guy's face.  Right in his face.  Making him apologize.  Showing the ugliness that is me.  Yeah.  Yelling, cursing.  And I have no problem.  That's the type of radio show we do.  I look like a complete and utter lunatic.  It was wonderful.  Anthony looks like he belongs in a mafia film.  I turned into a mobster voice.  That's Winnegan.  Hey, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, yeah, you got some, I got a little.  Now you're acting like a big a little.  You're laying on the ground like some kind of a fan. 
[02:05:30]  No, I can't.  So here it is.  This is what we're allowed to play according to the lawyers.  You're not going to believe it.  You're not going to believe this.  Okay.  What?  Play it.  Oh.  Here it is.  What is this?  There you go.  That's it.  There you go.  That's what we're allowed to play.  That's what we're allowed to play right there.  That's it. 
[02:06:00]  Would have worked better if I could read freaking sign language.  I think you did fine.  Oh, yeah.  It was very fun.  What?  What do you want me to do?  Why are you making the button motion?  Like they didn't hear all that before the bit.  Stupid.  That's how stupid I am.  You don't have to call me stupid or write email saying how stupid I am.  I tell you I'm stupid.  That's right.  I tell you I can't speak at times.  I tell you I'm a lunatic.  I tell you I got a psycho factor in my head that might let me in jail someday.  But when it comes to sign language, I'm a dope at that, too. 
[02:06:30]  I'm signing.  What an idiot I am.  I don't even know why I'm here.  All right?  There.  There.  I don't even know my role on the show.  There.  What do I do?  Asses.  What is this?  Where'd you get this?  Where'd that come from?  It'd be $10 to a golfer to get it.  On the subway.  Where was it supposed to be hanging?  They're putting them up on the subway stations now.  Yeah.  It's not supposed to be hanging somewhere?  I'm sure you should probably hang it somewhere. 
[02:07:00]  Buddy Higgins should punch you.  Please have him say subway.  Please have him say subway 10.  Where the hell did you find this?  On the subway.  Really?  Where?  Which one?  Which line?  I seen him on the G.  Again, I got this one on the E line.  The E line of the subway?  Yeah.  Wow.  Now, how does this hang up?  Who's that?  It ticked off.  I can't hear you.  It ticked off.  Is it glue?  What is it?  It's a poster.  It's a big sticker. 
[02:07:30]  It's a big with the subway.  Where?  This is all their audience here.  In the subway.  They hang up on the subway.  Obviously, that's the guy coming into this.  Here he comes now.  Mr. Witt.  Here comes the guy that we had the problem with.  It's a poster.  It's a big sticker.  It's a big with the subway.  And the subway.  Where?  This is all their audience here.  And the subway.  They hang up on the subway.  30,000.  They did it.  XM.  Subway.  30,000.  This is your whole audience.  This is Opie and Anthony's whole audience here. 
[02:08:00]  I just want to say, um, Howard Stern has a huge cock, and I love him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Opie's going to lose his mind.  Opie's going to lose his mind.  Why was that not bleeped so he can play this without it getting dumped out of?  You knew it was the walk over.  You know it's only on XM, so there's curses and plenty of them during that walk. 
[02:08:30]  That guy just said the, um, C word.  Howard has a big C.  Ah.  And.  My fault.  My fault.  Great.  My fault.  My fault.  Is this, is any of this edited, by the way?  My fault.  My fault.  None of that's edited.  My fault.  Of course.  Of course.  Oh, geez.  Don't, don't hit that.  Nothing is edited, by the way.  Why would it be clean for this side of the show?  I wouldn't have had it to you.  I don't, I don't, I.  Ah! 
[02:09:00]  Ah!  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We're running out of show.  We want to at least get this audio on.  All right.  Good job.  Keep talking.  Uh, open Anthony at Douchebags.  All right.  Yeah, beat me up.  Let's go.  No, let him go.  Let him go.  What else?  All right, guys.  Uh, what else?  What do we got here?  What do we got here?  Are you going to, look at it, stupid.  You see what we got here?  It's called advertising for a radio show, sir.  What?  It's called advocacy 92.3.  You look like I don't.  Remember where Howard used to be?  And now, now there's about 100,000 people, about 100,000 people listening to him. 
[02:09:30]  Is this the best you got?  Come on, man.  I'm not a stand, though.  Dude, no, no, no, I don't mean comedy, but we're just like an install.  You just, you're going through the motions.  I gotta go to work right now.  You're going through the motions.  I know, I know, I know.  I don't really like these guys.  They just steal a lot of shit from Howard.  I don't really like them.  Yeah, of course we do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Steal a lot of shit like his radio stations.  His radio stations, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Now, uh-huh.  Now he sits there.  And that would be the point where, um, you know, the excitement happened. 
[02:10:00]  There were two S-bombs dropped during that.  So if you were listening and, uh, heard the dumps, or didn't hear the dumps, heard big  gaps in the, um, broadcast there, that's because the S-bombs were not bleeped out.  Oh, my God.  I can't even look.  Jimmy, I can't even look to my left.  The anger.  There is pure anger pouring off of Opie. 
[02:10:30]  And they want raises.  And you guys need more money.  You need more money so you keep screwing up the show, right?  It is almost.  We can't even do the basics.  It is almost turning into something visible, the anger.  It's like liquefying or solidifying.  If you need more money, go find another job.  Trust me, I don't give a crap.  This show will continue with or without the people behind the scenes.  I don't give a crap. 
[02:11:00]  No one's getting more money anytime soon if I have anything to say about it.  Uh-oh.  I'd rather find other people, give them more money, and give them a shot at it.  Oh, boy.  And we want to talk about how ridiculous that is with the lawyer thing, but it becomes something else.  They've cut out.  Are we still on XM?  Now I can't even explain how ridiculous that is because all hell breaks loose after the clip ends.  But I don't even know what they heard because we had to dump out of the C word, the S word twice.  We'll see you over there at XM for our XM listeners. 
[02:11:30]  And for everybody here on the wonderful CBS radio stations, we will see you tomorrow.  Love and kisses, Anthony.  And I'll talk to you in a couple of minutes.  Responsible parents everywhere, Opie and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves. 
[02:12:00]  So take your baby off that windowsill and sit him in front of the radio.  To hear the shriek of a small child, that would be wonderful.  Opie and Anthony Dash, bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:12:30]  Let's walk.  It's the walkover.  Can you hear me?  XM.  Am I on the radio?  Bye, CBS people.  See you tomorrow.  Bye, guys.  Yes, Jimmy, I hear you.  Hey, by the way, in those promos for our gays, can someone tell Steve to not say August?  The way he says August.  Holy mackerel.  August.  August.  Listen to that.  That's how the bear talks. 
[02:13:00]  He's laughing at you.  Oh, that lady slip.  I'm taking that picture.  I'm going to giggle all day about that.  Because it's just so awful.  Mama.  Down a canyon.  Well, again, I've heard reports of the buses here in the city have our advertisements on the back.  I got to.  I know.  I'm just looking at Opie and Kenny walking.  How far?  50 feet in front of us.  I'd say 50 feet in front of us.  And Opie has his mic dangling down to the right. 
[02:13:30]  If it's on or not, I haven't a clue.  Holy shit.  Oh, she's tall.  Yeah.  Oh, it's on.  Oh.  He just said it's on and threw it on his table on the sidewalk.  Yeah, it's an outdoor cafe.  Oh, boy.  And now Kenny's carrying it.  Yeah.  Oh, please don't talk into it, you big dope.  Hey, Janice Soprano.  Oh.  Wow.  Dead ringer.  Yeah.  What a fatso. 
[02:14:00]  What a beautiful day here in New York today.  Very happy.  I had a nice bum.  Oh.  Yeah.  On the corner.  Oh, we can cross.  Let's cross the street, Ed.  Cross with the green.  This is a lovely walkover.  This is a very peaceful, very nice, warm, wonderful walkover.  We are now returning to the scene of the crime.  Hey, Dyke here.  As it were, when we cross the next street. 
[02:14:30]  Son of man, be lifted up.  What's that, sir?  Whosoever believeth in him.  Oh.  Did not perish.  Did you say believeth?  Sir, why did you say believeth?  Why did I say believeth?  Believeth, yes, not believe.  Well, that's old English.  You got to talk.  If you want people to respond.  Oh, Opie, there was no reason to tear that.  You just saw it.  Tear that up.  No, I'm saying if you want people to, it's easier.  You guys, did I have to do a knee of many minutes?  What did you think of the Da Vinci Code, sir?  It shall go in and out.  Did you see the Da Vinci Code? 
[02:15:00]  Or read the book?  The Da Vinci Code is lies.  Should it be boycotted or should it just be shown as entertainment?  But it's presented as fiction.  Isn't that okay?  Because I hear the church wasn't very happy with it.  No?  The Bible says it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.  But then what?  And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it.  But then what?  Then what happens?  And there was found no palladium, two fingers, not plugged in.  But then what happens?  And his earpiece is out.  His one earpiece is in and his one is out.  Yeah.  I putteth one in so I could heareth out of this ear what thine is saying. 
[02:15:30]  There's a white throne and him that sat on it.  What is in your shirt?  Is that a goiter?  Is it a hernia?  A hernia.  Why don't you pray to have that thing removed?  Oh my God.  Why should I have it removed?  Because it's a hernia.  What were you lifting?  Long Island?  That's funny.  Come on, dude.  That's funny.  You lifting Long Island?  What were you lifting?  Long Island?  You can't lift Long Island.  It's impossible.  You've got to still have a sense of humor.  Even if you're into religion, you've got to find things funny, right?  Right, right.  What do you find funny?  Do you watch TV at all? 
[02:16:00]  Or is it all evil?  Just the news.  Just the news?  That's pretty depressing.  A lot of religious people get a bad rap because people think they have no sense of humor.  Right.  And they're just all about religion.  Do you do anything that's not religious on a daily basis?  Or is everything dedicated to God?  Anything?  Like for fun?  Just for fun?  Everything else is sinful.  Everything else is sinful.  So your whole existence here is just to serve the Lord for what happens later, right? 
[02:16:30]  Wait, I have bad hearing.  I'm sorry.  What do you enjoy doing that is not what I enjoy?  Boy, God screwed you over.  This is something you enjoy, but this is not all you enjoy.  What else do you enjoy?  You wasted my time.  No, I'm actually...  We're actually asking you a real question.  This is probably the most intelligent interview we've tried to...  This is all of Satan.  It's all of Satan?  Well, I'll have to agree with you there.  Obi did rip it up.  That is a good point.  Obi's Satan.  The guy actually made sense on his last sentence.  Obi is Satan. 
[02:17:00]  Satan wants that audio.  Satan would have been happier if the audio came edited.  Jesus.  That guy could not...  First of all, he looks like he has a softball in the front of his shirt.  It was giant.  A hernia.  Lifting long-eyed.  I've never seen...  You're funny, Jimmy.  Thank you.  He looks like New Jersey in pants.  Ho, hoi!  King of...  You know, what happens?  Why don't people take us seriously?  We were conducting probably the most normal interview with the guy. 
[02:17:30]  I wanted some real answers.  And he goes, we're wasting his time.  Yeah, you know.  Isn't him standing here with his thine and thous a complete waste of time?  He did like being called out on his dreck.  Oh, hello, fella.  Ugh.  He wasn't even cute.  I know.  Tall with a fucking tight Amish beard.  Red-headed boy with a shirt that came down to his belt.  Yuck.  Ugh.  Another guy in a hurry. 
[02:18:00]  Fuck.  Everyone's in a hurry.  Slow down.  Oh, we're coming up to the wooden wall.  All right.  That Ben was pushed against.  Yeah.  Any suspects?  Who are those two guys?  Shake them down.  Yeah.  I want those two brought to the ground.  I want those two men raped.  Ooh.  It's a little rough.  Well, you know.  Even if they're not involved.  Whatever it takes.  I'm with you. 
[02:18:30]  Well, here we are.  Look at Kenny.  Kenny running a little block.  That's nice.  That's all right.  They're just two.  That's nice.  Two men.  One who kind of looks like.  Gentleman.  Retarded Mark Wahlberg.  Didn't he?  Exactly.  They look like Mocky Mock.  And here we are.  See how quickly that was?  I would have liked our interview to continue with Mr. Religious Guy, but he pointed at the torn up little Bible and said, 
[02:19:00]  This is Satan.  And that was over.  Well, we're in the building, and we will be upstairs in the XM Studios in a matter of minutes.  So we will talk to you then.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:19:30]  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zilter and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Despicable asshat.  And these dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve. 
[02:20:00]  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  If you have any poo, sing it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:20:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, my God.  That's loud.  Hi.  That didn't take long. 
[02:21:30]  A little embarrassment in the elevator.  And we're here.  The Opie and Anthony show, Mark 2.  Yes, Kenny.  Could I please have a smoothie?  Extra smooth, please.  Welcome.  Welcome.  A grunt I would take as a yes, Kenny.  Oh.  Why would you bring in a big, round cardboard tube?  It will end up in someone's ass. 
[02:22:00]  That will end up up somebody's ass.  Okay.  We're going to do breathing exercises.  Everybody in the audience.  Everybody.  Breathing.  Here we go.  In.  Put your hands on your thighs.  Now go in.  And out.  There you go. 
[02:22:30]  And with each exhale, just relax your muscles more and more.  Every one of them.  Here we go.  Relax now.  Oh, look at that.  I can almost fall asleep.  I'm so relaxed now.  That's better.  Look at the horrified Iraq having to only be feet away from Opie for the rest of the day. 
[02:23:00]  He's so petrified, he's turned completely red.  Oh, wait.  That's right.  It's our beach.  Opie, before this show, just sent Ben off in order to make up for things to take a picture from the Grand Canyon.  He doesn't want one from any place, though.  It has to be over the railing.  That's right. 
[02:23:30]  Dude, I...  They all have to stay away from me.  There will be changes.  Trust me.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change it.  Mikey.  Thanks, Mike.  Thank you, my friend.  That is one scary SOB right there.  The friend.  Is he a cop?  Oh, please.  Stop it.  What do you think?  I don't know what he is.  I don't know.  I couldn't...  He looks like a fucking wacko.  I think he's a Waffen SS.  I don't know what he is, but he's frightening. 
[02:24:00]  That guy looks like one of the guys that just comes out of a doorway, shoots you, and gets back into incognito.  Let's just put it this way.  He doesn't exist as a person.  Right.  There's no record of him.  There's no record of that guy.  I've been doing radio a really long time.  I think I might have had a nervous breakdown.  No, that wasn't a nervous breakdown.  Ben actually tries to make good...  And I swear to God, none of these guys come in. 
[02:24:30]  I swear to God, just leave me alone.  It's at the leave me alone stage.  No little interview with them as you're discussing this?  Let what happens happens, because just leave me alone.  Because, you know, Steve, like, starts with my fault, my fault, my fault.  And then Ben tries to get me at the elevator and goes, I don't know what happened.  And I actually looked at him like, Ben, you're the executive producer of the show, and you're telling me you don't know what happened?  Isn't it your job to make sure it's ready for airplay in the end?  And in the end, it's your responsibility. 
[02:25:00]  So your answer to me is going to be, I don't know what happened?  We built up this whole thing to play the audio.  And obviously, we're doing it for commercial radio, so it has to be FCC-friendly.  Yeah.  And there's three curses in there.  You know, when I started hearing it...  So now it doesn't even matter what the point we were trying to make.  I heard it rolling, and I'm thinking, oh my God, I hope they know that there are curses in here. 
[02:25:30]  And the first one dropped, the cock dropped.  And I'm like, oh no, oh no, oh no.  And then after that, the two shits came out.  And the reason was because they didn't have the audio over there to begin with.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you would...  Yeah.  Iraq, what's with sticking the finger up at all?  Boy's talking.  The guy's trying to make a point, and you're flipping him the bird?  Not even...  Iraq, wait a minute. 
[02:26:00]  He won't even give the fucking watch.  His eyes moved with the...  There's a dog about to bite me.  Can you get it away?  It's like you were talking to a deaf person.  He didn't even hear you.  He looked straight ahead.  His eyes flickered to me.  Please not now.  Please not now.  Back to the screen.  Screen, screen.  Please not now.  Please not now.  Back to the screen.  Hey, Iraq.  Just to reiterate, I mean, one of the biggest things happened to us on Friday. 
[02:26:30]  Anyway, why wouldn't you have that audio with you?  That was a big thing.  Why wouldn't you have it?  We should have had the audio for the FM audio.  We argued all weekend if we should play it or not.  I said, it's ridiculous we're not playing it.  And then, you know, Elo had to give me some horse shit why we're not playing it and how  he's protecting our asses, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, regardless of how much of it we were able to play, this, that, whatever it was,  we should have had it available. 
[02:27:00]  It should have had it, just in case.  You never know.  And we don't have it.  So then they panic and they try to cover their asses.  So they all of a sudden hear typing, which means they're IMing Steve or somebody back over  here to go get the audio and run it back to the other joint.  With no time left.  So they have no time.  So they're just panicking, trying to cover their asses.  So of course it was going to come back, you know, fucked up.  Come back with no beeps in it. 
[02:27:30]  We got to figure out a way just to open something from the 92.3 studio that's on a computer here.  This way you don't have to physically run it back.  You can just say, get me that file and it can be there in two seconds.  Are they working on that?  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Comment?  Still working on it.  They haven't hooked it up yet.  Open it up.  What?  Well, who's, who's, what are they not hooking up?  I just love how uncomfortable it looks.  It's a delay system.  Why aren't they?  Why?  They're waiting to install the line.  That's all I know.  But it's going to happen? 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Can that be a little easier than running across the street this week and open up, run  a test on it three seconds after you ask for it?  Like we do here.  If we need something, boom, it gets punched up on the computer.  Yeah.  Instead of people getting punched in the face.  August.  August.  August.  Listen to the way Steve says August in the dumb clips.  August.  It's like Caffey.  Caffey Diva.  Caffey Diva.  And when in August.  Don't bite your arm.  Don't bite. 
[02:28:30]  You're not caught in a trap.  What are you doing?  He's chewing his arm off.  And now, yeah, I think he feels he is.  If he's chewing his arm off so he could leave.  Oh, my God.  Well, to the staff here, I just want to say good luck, bros.  I wish I had a little bracelet to stretch.  Good luck, bros.  Good luck, bros.  Someone, what are you thinking?  Sacrificial lamb?  I'd say this again. 
[02:29:00]  Random or somebody that deserves it.  And, you know, then I have to hear how we're underpaid and we checked into what other guys  are making in the same position I'm in and they're making more money.  Who said that, by the way?  Trust me.  You know.  Yeah.  It doesn't even matter, you know.  And this is what I say to you.  Then go find another job that pays you more money.  And then, you know, watch that the show does not collapse.  What is a news for your physicist?  The show will go on with other people.  Looking into that.  The show will go on with other people. 
[02:29:30]  If you think you're underpaid, which I think is a joke at this point, then go find another  job.  Find another fucking job.  I don't give a shit.  That's how I got more money.  I thought I should be making more money in Buffalo and Long Island and Rochester.  They weren't going to give me more money.  So I said, all right, fuck you.  And I went and got another job with more money.  Yeah, but we like Jimmy Norton.  And, you know.  I'm talking about the meme.  I'm not talking about the meme players.  And I didn't say anything threatening. 
[02:30:00]  I just said, I go without more money.  And I want it in cash and a bag by tomorrow.  My way or the highway.  Oh.  There you go.  Some nice creamy yogurt.  There you go.  Sometimes yogurt just straightens me out.  Strawberry?  But I'm sad sometimes a good yogurt will take care of that for me.  I hope Kenny gets here with the smoothies quickly.  Yeah.  Because smoothies seem to smooth things out. 
[02:30:30]  I hope so.  Because I had a bran muffin and oatmeal.  So my body's not going to know whether to create bricks or shit all over the place.  There's going to be a big adobe pile in the bowl.  I'm going to shit a clay hut.  It's a little aborigine home.  Small people.  I look like Eric, but brown.  He asked us to take shit without straw.  I want to hug Iraq. 
[02:31:00]  He looks sad.  No.  He's petrified.  Oh.  He's petrified.  I can't even.  I can't even.  I can't even.  I am.  You know.  Is there anyone you are comfortable with right now that you can look at?  Yeah.  You guys.  I just can't.  What about Derek?  I can't on any.  I can't even tell you how frustrated and.  Why bring you into it?  I know I am right now.  I know.  People will say Opie.  Derek's innocent.  Opie is getting on my nerves. 
[02:31:30]  Opie shut up and do radio show.  Travis is an idiot.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  Could change tomorrow.  Go ahead, Bob.  Yeah, Opie.  You know, I like you guys as a show.  Norton is a genius.  But I hope you've got like several life insurance.  Policies taken out on Ant.  Because every time he goes on vacation or drives in his car or just, you know,  runs the risk of getting hurt and injured or killed.  You must gasp because you have no talent. 
[02:32:00]  He's carrying you.  Oh, boy.  This is going to help.  Hey, Bob.  Bob, he's not a fan of the show.  Bob, do you understand, Tom?  If you need to know.  I'm a huge fan of the show.  Hold on.  If you need to know, Tom, I have F you money.  I don't have to do this ever again.  I love to.  So why would I be all like worried about Anthony?  I could walk tomorrow.  I don't have to ever do this again.  I worry about it.  Guys, I love the show.  It's not divide and conquer.  Absolutely it is.  Anthony is the heart of the show.  Opie, he's carrying you.  He's carrying you.  What about me, sir?  Am I just limping along? 
[02:32:30]  I'm kind of in the middle.  You're the superstar on the rise.  I'm hung over Ant's shoulder.  I hobble along.  Right.  Opie's carried, and I kind of hobble along on one foot.  I'm saying that the biggest dick in radio is Opie, and yet he talks as though he's the  center of the universe, and he's not.  Anthony, I mean, this show is nothing without Anthony.  You don't understand, and it's nothing without Opie.  You don't understand the dynamic of this show and how it works, sir.  While your compliments are just thrilling for me, you don't understand how a ship runs 
[02:33:00]  without a rudder.  Opie, the ship does not run without a rudder.  I understand he moves it along.  No, no.  More than moves it along, though.  You make it sound like that's a secondary little thing.  Oh, I understand he moves it along.  Thank God.  Would you like me and Jimmy would sit here and talk about the same subject for four hours  until the entire audience was asleep?  We would have arguments about political garbage that would bore the living shit out of the audience, 
[02:33:30]  not knowing or caring that we were sending the audience away in droves.  We need direction.  Do you think actors who are very talented can go and star in a movie without a director?  Do you think they know where to stand or how to deliver certain lines or when a scene should  end without the proper direction, sir? 
[02:34:00]  I almost hate saying stuff like this because it's almost like embarrassing.  It's like you should fucking know this.  But I'll break the 83rd wall.  What a place.  It's a pentagon.  As much as Anne and I have laughed, and I mean this in complete honesty, the biggest  laugh I have had on this show was delivered by the blonde sweetie.  It was delivered.  Not something Anne said or something I said.  It was the fucking, probably the poker chip I think is the biggest laugh I've had on this  show. 
[02:34:30]  It's like, it's not just guiding, there's an element to that uncomfortableness, the ability  to do that which makes great radio, which I don't have.  And all this should not have to be explained.  And Ant doesn't have.  Oh, he's the best asshole ever.  It's not even being an asshole, dude.  It's an ability to do it with people in the room.  It's beyond being an asshole.  It's an ability to know what's making great radio, and despite how uncomfortable it is  and being a nice guy off the air, it's an ability to do that that neither one of us has. 
[02:35:00]  I'm not being polite, but I hate saying that because it sounds like you're sucking up, but  honest to God is the truth.  And the credit is that you don't even see it.  That's the credit to it.  That's the best part.  You sit there and don't see it because the average Joe shouldn't.  It's just, it makes the show seem like it's just flowing right along, doesn't it?  Dude, the fucking Patty being naked.  One last thing.  More importantly.  Hold on, sweetie.  Patty being naked and having her first orgasm was something Ope said, which I thought was 
[02:35:30]  absolutely never going to happen.  He said, we're going to get you to play with yourself or some sexual thing, like we're going  to get this to happen.  I never would have thought of that.  Ant never would have thought of that.  And that's not, and again, that's not being polite.  That's a fact.  It's an idea, man.  And Patty wound up having her first orgasm on the air.  I mean, do we need to explain it?  That was a great radio.  Well, dude, that's the stuff that you have to understand.  That's where that comes from.  Where do you think it comes from?  I mean, I love ass, head. 
[02:36:00]  What's that?  But I would love.  You have a problem with Ope personally.  That's fine.  But don't.  Dude, you have a problem with Ope personally.  He hits something unnerving you.  There's something about, he reminds you of somebody.  There's something about him you don't like.  But you can't be biased and deny the contribution to the radio show.  That's just dishonest.  Well, I'm not biased.  I'm obviously a big fan.  No, no, no.  I mean biased against him because he bugs something in you.  He's just a guy that I like.  Like you two guys, I would love to hang out with, I think, socially.  Ope, I could not stand him. 
[02:36:30]  I wind up punching him just at some point.  He just gets under my skin and zap him.  See, he reminds you of something, but you can't, okay, fine.  That's the beauty of him.  But you can't deny what the radio show is because of him.  There's no show without him and there's no show without Ant.  I don't say that without mock humility.  Don't you like that dynamic?  Don't you like that dynamic that there's somebody that you find abrasive?  But there's good cop, bad cop.  Then there's just being silly for, I mean, being cruel and being, you know, a jerk for no, you know, 
[02:37:00]  if you've got to go six miles to get back to the point to be an asshole that whole trip,  it's not really worth it.  A lot of times it's overkill, it's overkill.  Sometimes we all have overkill, dude, but right now he's furious about something that happened  and he's correct with what he wanted, which was that to be played or at least it to be ready  and for the audio to be cleaned up for free FM.  I mean, he's right to want that, dude.  We all wanted that.  He is furious about it and he expressed it on the air.  And there's something about that which makes the show honest, dude, and that's just honest radio. 
[02:37:30]  So it is honest radio.  Well, then you can't in some charity capacity, get his ass on the basketball court as well.  Well, dude, it's not a baby.  I don't think he's a you're wrong.  Spoiled.  It's going to get you on the basketball court, man.  Dude, you really are allowing a personal dislike because he reminds you of somebody,  of a guy that bullied you or of a guy that fired you.  He reminds you of somebody.  And so you're allowing it to be biased.  It's not an accurate view. 
[02:38:00]  His little ass.  What's that?  It would never remind me of someone who bullied me.  He's the least intimidating person I've ever seen or heard.  Then why would you want to get him on the basketball court?  All right, tough guy.  That's just a joking kind of thing because he always brags about his prowess athletically.  Well, he's athletic.  What's wrong with that?  He doesn't brag.  You know a lot about Opie.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of the show.  Tough guy.  Well, then you got to love Opie, dude.  I'm not a tough guy.  There's no show without Opie.  You're a tough guy. 
[02:38:30]  No, not at all.  You'd be surprised.  See, normally he'd have hit the button and cut this motherfucker off because it's boring.  But he's sitting there and showing the torture that happens when it's just me, Jimmy, and  a stupid fucking caller.  And what you missed was before when he was biting his arm.  That didn't go out over the air, but it was just kind of fun to watch somebody who really  is filled with self-loathing like the rest of us.  So is Opie just fuming right now?  It was hysterical. 
[02:39:00]  What's that?  Is Opie just fuming right now?  No.  Dude, he doesn't give a shit.  He's just listening to you.  No, he's not.  Anymore.  He has one arm propped up.  Dude, the thing is, every word that's coming out of your mouth right now is proving a point.  Like, he's gotten beaten up on the air before.  I've gotten beaten up on the air before.  Everyone loves me.  It never happened.  Somebody posted something about one time, but it was a mistake.  They met somebody else.  So I know what it's like to sit there and have somebody call up, talking shit.  And it's like when the other guy is going to bat for you, it's like, it's not needed. 
[02:39:30]  And all the fans know it's not needed.  But it is kind of funny to hear something this obviously incorrect.  That's the truth, too, dude.  Well, I finished it too fast.  Dude, I know what you're saying.  You don't like somebody, and that's acceptable.  But you're being completely dishonest when you're looking at the way the radio show is run, and you understand that.  And you do know that.  And you just try to bug up so you're not telling the truth. 
[02:40:00]  No, you're off on that regard.  Well, then you just don't.  Then you're really reading it wrong.  You're saying his genius is that I don't see how he leads the program.  He is the true leader of the program.  But it's even more than just leading the program.  It's not just button pushing and leading the program.  It's seeing Patty have an orgasm and saying this is what's going to happen, where nobody else in the studio would have done that.  Oh, so he came up with it.  I mean, your interns come up with great ideas sometimes.  Dude, beyond, beyond.  Come on, man.  You know that's not true.  Oh, my God.  And our interns very rarely come up with anything.  They're fucking dopes. 
[02:40:30]  Be honest.  What do you do for a living?  I have a small business.  See, you're not being honest.  What do you do?  I have a small business.  What fucking small business?  Anyone, a kid selling fucking lemonade on the side of the road is a small business, you cunt.  What do you fucking do, Paul?  Can I get a word in?  Yeah, I asked you twice.  You gave me the same fucking no answer.  What do you do, shithead?  What do you do?  Import, export things.  Import, export. 
[02:41:00]  What do you fucking import, export to this country?  With your small business.  Give me a specific thing.  What you fucking do.  What's your job description?  You dishonest fuck.  Go ahead.  Small electronic parts.  You ship in from Japan.  You get small electronic parts and do what with them?  See that they get sent to places for a simple...  What an exciting fucking life you lead.  You're a bored, dull fuck who can't accept the fact that other people are enjoying themselves in life and having a little fun with their job. 
[02:41:30]  And then when someone gets a little pissed with what's supposed to be an easy fucking job, it upsets you.  Because you're fucking sitting there waiting for little resistors to come in from some shithole Hong Kong town.  Now you're miserable.  And the reason...  Yeah, you know why?  You know why I knew that, Paul?  Because you didn't even want to fess up to what shit fucking job you have.  You didn't even want to fess up. 
[02:42:00]  I had asked you five fucking times.  Five times I had to ask you.  And you weren't being honest because you have a self-fucking-loathing of what you do and who you are.  And that's coming through loud and clear.  Goodbye, Paul.  Ass.  Oh, I get sick of that.  Be honest.  That came through loud and clear, by the way. 
[02:42:30]  Loud and clear.  People are pissed at that.  I understand.  I used to listen to fucking radio when I was working, and it sucked.  Oh, did I hate listening to people fucking having fun.  And then whenever anybody had a bad time, you're like, well, go fuck yourself, fuck you.  Because you're miserable.  When you...  Here's what it is.  You remind them of somebody, and that happens in life.  When you hear somebody telling you something, and it's so inaccurate, you know it's coming from another place. 
[02:43:00]  That's all it is.  And again, be honest about that.  All right, we'll take a break, I guess.  No!  Why not?  I don't want to take a break.  I don't have to.  That smoothie, by the way, was piss warm.  What?  I thought I heard, mm-hmm.  Who said that?  Did someone say something?  Do you know, I swear to God, I cut a gasser, and it went, your ass talked to me.  No, you fucking answered it. 
[02:43:30]  I answered your ass.  What'd you say?  I answered Jimmy's asshole.  It went, huh?  And he looks at Derek, how great would it be?  I thought Derek was Jimmy's ass.  The only thing that could have made...  My asshole spells better.  The only thing that...  The only thing that could have made me happy is if somebody was fired because they thought...  You thought they got fresh, and you fired them.  His ass is getting fresh. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, is that funny?  Your ass answered me, and then I talked back to it.  What?  Who said what?  Who said your ass?  Yeah.  His breath stinks.  Who said the...  Who said the Russians are coming?  Who said...  All right.  Did Bob make a point anywhere in there, by the way?  Is that his name?  No.  It was actually Bob.  No.  Good old Bob.  Good old Bob.  Was it Bob?  I thought it was Paul from Missouri.  These people that don't understand having passion. 
[02:44:30]  Sorry, Paul.  These people out there that don't understand having passion to do something.  Yeah.  They don't understand that.  And like really being into it.  You know, we like to try to be real and honest.  So we don't mind showing the bruises and the scars and the cuts.  You think I sit back and go, oh, wow.  I must be looking really cool right now on the radio.  I know I look like a complete asshole.  But I get that that's appealing when you're doing a radio show where you allow people to  see in and see everything. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  All that shit.  You know, the yell and scream.  And that happens on a million radio shows out there.  But you never hear it.  When the mics are off.  Do you honestly think I sit back and go, wow, I must look good right now?  I know I look like a crybaby.  I know that.  But I don't worry about it.  I never did.  So, Bob, you know, you were expecting me to yell and scream at you.  I wasn't going to yell and scream at you.  Whatever, dude.  The reality is I do have that few money.  We don't like to talk about, you know, how much we're making and stuff. 
[02:45:30]  I don't.  I can leave tomorrow.  And that's it.  The show would go on.  These guys would do more radio.  But I'm not sitting there, like, shaking in my boots, wondering, you know, if this is  our last show or something.  I still do this because I enjoy it.  And I have a great time doing it.  I just want the people around me and behind the scenes to have the same passion and, you  know, help out the show and do the basics.  They don't even do the basics.  And if you don't understand that, I don't know what to tell you. 
[02:46:00]  But I'll make it perfectly clear.  Yes, I realize I look like a crybaby.  I'm not stupid.  Of course I do.  You either want an honest show or you don't.  I mean, that's the bottom line.  You're going to see it.  I just threw a tantrum in front of a bunch of listeners outside Free FM.  You think I'm walking down the sidewalk with my arms folded and throwing the mic on a  table like they're looking at me like, wow, look, he's pretty fucking cool.  No, I know they're like, like, what a baby.  I know that.  You don't have to tell me.  People say, great.  Opie leaves.  It'll be Anthony talking to Jimmy's asshole. 
[02:46:30]  See?  Do you understand that if Opie left for a day, you would hear four hours of shining  quotes and not one story?  It would be circular dreck.  You know what, bro?  I would tune in and listen to that, though.  There's been times we've gotten caught in those stupid, obscure things that really maybe  one percent of the audience enjoys, but it doesn't matter.  It's, like, fun to do. 
[02:47:00]  But it's like, no one's enjoying it, and I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  And we have fun.  Exactly.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  I think people should expect a lot from this show.  Of course.  And when, like, when you get the dumb lawyers in Washington, you know, running around thinking  they know what we're about and what radio's about, if you don't feel the frustration with  us, I don't know what to tell you.  When you have a lawyer hand in a piece of audio that is one of the biggest things that  happened to us in the last few years, and they tell us that we're allowed to play it up  to a certain point, and you don't see how ridiculous that is, you should be outraged as well. 
[02:47:30]  But if you're not, you're not.  Whatever.  Whatever.  What am I going to tell you?  Yeah.  You know, but if you can't see into that and realize why that would just drive us absolutely  nuts, knowing the audio is everywhere else.  Yeah.  It's everywhere.  Pictures are everywhere else.  There's pictures out there.  But, oh, my God, don't put them on any of your websites.  Well, they're out there.  People are finding them.  We're going to try to make believe it never happened?  That's ridiculous.  And then for, like, someone that's a huge big wig in the company, email me,  saying, good news, you can play the audio up to a point, and even he doesn't realize 
[02:48:00]  how ridiculous that is.  Up to the point that is entertaining.  Yeah.  So then I'm trying to make that point on the show, and then I realize the guys behind the  scene don't have their shit together, and they don't even have it cleaned up for regular  radio.  I'm supposed to sit there and go, oh, well, this is how it is?  I'm not changing my ways as far as that shit goes.  No way.  No fucking way.  Liddy Rule says, I just tuned in.  Who brought the wrong milk this time?  No.  It's a little more than that.  Dude, the fucking lawyers are enragingly frustrating to deal with. 
[02:48:30]  When you have to deal with them with bullshit, the show did nothing wrong in that incident.  Nothing.  We were minding our own business.  Nothing wrong.  We were minding our own business.  Someone came into our world.  We took care of the situation.  And I believe we did a good job taking care of the situation.  I'm listening to the audio a million times.  There's nothing on that audio that's going to get anyone in real trouble.  None.  There's just not.  And then the lawyers, they spent all weekend with phone calls.  I mean, you guys don't even know.  Phone call.  I spent my weekend on this stupid thing.  I can't tell you. 
[02:49:00]  I wish I could add up all the phone calls I took.  I wish I could add up all the dumb emails I had to read and respond to.  But we couldn't respond with too much info on the email just in case some third parties were looking in.  Yeah.  It was just the weirdest fucking thing.  Secret agent.  So we bring the frustration on the show like we do.  And people are like, shut up.  But if you don't play the bit, then people complain.  Or if it goes wrong, people complain.  How come that didn't come out right?  It's like, well, shit wasn't done properly.  You can't have it both ways.  You know, you can't have an honest radio show and then not hear the fucking. 
[02:49:30]  That was legitimate.  Complaining.  And then, you know, how the bit goes, because we're seeing ahead.  Like, all right, now let's play the audio and show how ridiculous the lawyers are in Washington.  So now I'm like, all right, at least we'll solve this.  Because we are still doing radio, believe it or not.  We're not just going on the air and bitching and complaining.  So I'm like, all right, now we got something.  Now we can show people and our listeners, and it'll be entertaining and funny in a way,  how ridiculous the lawyers are in Washington.  So we'll play the audio to where they say we can play it. 
[02:50:00]  And then people will be like, that's it?  Oh, my God.  Go find it, yeah.  These are a bunch of dummies down there that need to take a radio course.  And then you have your own guys that don't even make it friendly for commercial radio,  and I'm not supposed to bitch.  There was three curses in there that completely fucked up the whole flow of the bit, the whole flow.  And to begin with, we didn't even have the audio over there.  And then the executive producer, whatever the fuck his name is, I'm at the elevator,  and he actually says, dude, I don't know what happened.  I'm like, that's your job. 
[02:50:30]  In the end, you need to know what's happening at all times.  You need to, if you don't have confidence in the people under you, then you go, Steve,  is this, you know, did you edit out all the curses?  Is this good enough for commercial radio?  And he's going to come at me with, dude, I don't know what happened.  That is the worst answer you could tell anybody if you were the executive producer.  Well, he spent the morning chewing his arm out of a big trap.  He has an excuse.  As man as Ope was, when I heard cock come out over that one. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, I know.  It was almost like, all right, this is like a hidden camera sketch.  Yeah.  This couldn't be.  This could not be happening.  It was right after Ant Joe, please, God, let the CD not play just to be fun.  Like how awful that would be to see him go over the edge.  And then it plays, and it plays the word cock.  And cock flies out.  And then I'm like, I can't even look at him.  I know.  This is really bad.  Me and Jimmy just looked at each other like, oh, my God, that didn't just happen.  I didn't want to be mistaken for a homoerotic bear who might have left a cock in.  And you know what I'm doing in that situation, believe it or not?  I'm going, stay calm, stay calm, because you're going to come across looking like a complete asshole, a crybaby. 
[02:51:30]  They've just played into my stupid shit that I know I have.  I'm like, oh, my God.  All right, calm down, calm down, calm down.  Don't do this.  I know the fans, they're on a message board right now.  See, Ope's a crybaby again.  But I know I'm a crybaby.  More importantly, I'm being called the Dr. Doolittle of assholes. 
[02:52:00]  Who said that?  I swear I thought your asshole was commenting on my smoothie.  Please, can we hear that again at one point in the show?  Yeah.  You don't have to edit it.  It was not a far...  Call the lawyers to see if we can play that because it was gassed.  We can find it.  Yeah, we'll find it before break.  Brian in Virginia Beach.  What makes the show unique are the 4,000 walls that you tear down, and I'm fucking tired of the fans, quote unquote.  If you say they love the show because of that, then turn on you the second that you tear down those walls. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  That's why it's not the same fucking show as the morning people.  Yeah, I love that.  Hulu shit.  You know what?  All legitimate.  And for those who say it's scripted, go fuck your mother.  Look what's happening today.  We're talking about behind the show scenes.  The only reason we all think we know shit about radio is because of these kind of conversations.  If you don't like this shit, go turn it on, fuck it, wherever else.  You know, to the people that hate me and wish I wasn't on this show or whatever, I mean, you've got to at least give me credit for having the vision.  This show is my fucking vision.  And then I met Anthony, and we took it to this level. 
[02:53:00]  You know, but before Anthony, this was my vision.  No credit.  No, you get credit.  You know that.  No, that's like the guy that called before.  No credit.  You get nothing.  No credit.  No credit.  But I mean, I know it all.  This did start with me with a vision.  This was my vision back in the day.  Of course, it's a lot different.  I and I have been with each other 12 years, but it started with me with a stupid mic all over the fucking country.  And I, you know, I had a vision of doing more than just talking in between stupid fucking winger records. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, Ant, when Opie was sick, you guys did best of us two days.  Why?  Because the show wouldn't be the show without Opie.  Because it's in our contract.  We don't do the show separately anymore.  We used to.  And there's a reason why.  Yeah, because it's too much work.  It's like, fuck that.  It's just the, yeah, I mean.  It's not the Opie and Anthony show.  It would be different shows.  I could sit here and do a show.  It's not going to be the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie could sit here and do a show.  It's not going to be the Opie and Anthony show.  So, Jimmy, you could sit here and do a show. 
[02:54:00]  It would be Norton and Friends.  It's Norton and Friends.  And Norton and Friends.  Have all your comics in here.  My own theme song.  By the way, someone in the radio business, because I do get, you know, I got a lot of,  you know, people in the know.  It's not a big wig in the business.  Not that you need me telling you, but the FM version of that replay was butchered.  The best part with Anthony saying the joke about stealing Howard Stations was cut, and  all you heard was stations and the laughing afterwards. 
[02:54:30]  That's great.  So, there was absolutely no reason in the end to play that audio, because of the dumping  out.  None.  I have the dump sheet, by the way, if we want to do that.  Live from the Opie and Anthony show studios, the Daily Dump Report.  That's interesting.  Yeah, I disagree with this.  7.19 a.m., pulled your pants down and raped you, Norton, during your discussion of what 
[02:55:00]  happened during the walkover Friday.  So, not a sexual discussion.  The combination of pulling pants down made the raped comment too graphic.  How can you rape somebody with their pants on?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  That's not raping.  That's rush hour on the bus.  I don't understand how that got dumped out of.  And it wasn't a sexual conversation.  Not at all.  Don't agree with that.  No, that's one I want to go to Tom with and just go, dude, why are they, or even ask  Al, just like, why would that be done?  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  And then he pulls out a good one.  But I didn't hear.  8.24 a.m.  Fuckers.  English-sounding caller discussing World Cup.  Said while many people were talking, but it was still pretty clear.  Interesting.  Good pickup.  8.39 a.m.  He's already left the fuck, dot, dot, dot.  Opie talking about Ben leaving early.  8.52.  And here was from the clips.  Howard Stern has a huge cock replay of XM walkover from Friday. 
[02:56:00]  And 8.54 a.m.  Steal a lot of shit.  Said once by the guy on the street.  And once by Anthony during replay of XM walkover from Friday.  Uh, there you go.  2, 3, 4, 5.  5 dumps.  3 of which should never have happened at all.  One I don't agree with.  Right.  Should we play the audio of you talking to Norton's ass?  I don't know. 
[02:56:30]  I'm not really sure if that would be a good idea, so maybe...  Get the lawyers on the phone.  No, I mean, you know, I don't know if Bob is going to let me maybe suggest something.  Is that good?  No, it wouldn't be good then.  Should I direct it that way or maybe I can't do shit?  No, don't do anything.  Do you have that audio, Dirk?  I want to hear this fart.  I honestly...  It sounded like an answer.  It was a quiet one.  It wasn't a loud one.  You used to have good hearing.  But it sounded like somebody in the room.  I really thought it was Xerox to my left.  Yeah.  And then he realized, what am I doing?  Like, what am I doing even, you know? 
[02:57:00]  Like, it was Jimmy's ass agreeing with me that my smoothie was warm.  Right.  But I really thought it was Xerox.  And then I thought he was, like, thinking to himself, what am I doing even acknowledging that I'm in this room right now?  Crank it up so we could hear it.  All right.  Here it is.  All right.  We'll take a break, I guess.  No!  Why not?  I don't want to take a break.  I don't have to.  That smoothie, by the way, was piss warm.  What?  That's what I heard.  Who said that? 
[02:57:30]  Did someone say something?  Idiot.  Wait.  Oh, Jesus.  It sounded like a hmm.  I heard, I heard like a hmm.  Like your ass agreed that my smoothie was warm, Jimmy.  Oh, it did.  My smoothie was so piss warm.  Mm-hmm.  Can you rewind that?  Yeah.  Let me hear that again.  Wait.  Try not to laugh too hard in the background.  Because he continues to talk.  Yeah, I'm talking to his ass at that point.  Listen, listen.  I don't want to take a break. 
[02:58:00]  I don't have to.  That smoothie, by the way, was piss warm.  What?  I thought I heard, mm-hmm.  Who said that?  Did someone say something?  Did you say that?  I swear to God, I cut a gasser, and it went, hmm.  Your ass talked to me.  No, you fucking answered it.  I answered your ass.  What'd you say?  I answered Jimmy's asshole.  It went, hmm. 
[02:58:30]  Come on, now.  You got to admit, we're back live.  You got to admit, that sounded like, hmm.  Next time, why don't we do this to cut all problems out?  How about you put your ear right next to it?  Just so you know exactly what it says.  I'm not going to put my ear on your ass.  That laugh.  It answered me.  It said, mm-hmm.  That laugh might beat poker chip laugh, man.  Because that is unbelievable.  God, is that funny?  And then he's like all paranoid, like he's just hearing voices.  Yeah, because then I'm looking to see who else had a smoothie.  Because that would be the only way they could agree.  And I saw a straw of Jimmy's ass drinking a smoothie. 
[02:59:00]  And yes, it did agree.  Uh-huh.  Pretty warm.  Uh-huh.  That was the Munaki fuck.  Your ass went, mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  Let's go to Pat in New Jersey.  Pat, what's up?  Oh, that's funny.  Norton's asshole does these impersonations.  You think they're the real?  What's an act?  Very funny.  Very nice.  You can see how a girl could like that asshole.  All right.  You want to play that audio again? 
[02:59:30]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Is this a phone call?  Text?  What do you got?  The pebble comes out?  I like the pebble.  Hello.  Uh-huh.  What's that?  Well, I'm in the middle of doing my job.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, thanks.  I'll see you then.  Uh-oh.  Getting my teeth clean tomorrow.  Oh.  Why do they have to confirm that?  Exactly.  It's the big stupid doctor confirmation. 
[03:00:00]  I see.  Working from...  Yes.  And I'm not as stupid as you think.  I was ready to give them holy hell, and then I realized they're going to be picking at  my teeth tomorrow.  So call them back and confirm your appointment time with them.  That's what I'd like to do.  Hi.  I'm coming in at two, and I don't want to sit in the waiting room until three.  I was ready to...  Is the doctor going to be ready?  I was ready to just beat them up, and then I realized they're going to have those sharp  little hooky things in my mouth tomorrow.  Is it safe?  I was just going to say that.  Enjoy your youth as they roll their sleeves up. 
[03:00:30]  Polite conversation.  Yeah.  We'll hook your cavity.  It's safe.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll continue with the show next.  What?  One more time?  What?  One more time.  I don't know what he's saying.  Yeah, I thought you wanted to play it one more time.  The fart at me.  You want to play it in the right part?  One more time.  I really don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing on radio, so maybe someone can help me out.  Derek's so fired.  Yeah, what is this?  A Derek and Anthony show?  I say when Ope says go to break, you don't stop and go, whoa, what about another time?  No, I don't really know. 
[03:01:00]  I haven't done radio long enough to know.  Replay the part where he said to replay it.  Yeah.  And then put fire it on the pad and spell it F-Y-R-I-D.  Ladies and gentlemen, the one, the only, Sandy Kane.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.

[03:01:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, joining Sandy Kane, Mr. James Brown! 
[03:02:00]  I don't need it.  P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.  P-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p.  Come on. 
[03:02:30]  Sit in, sit in, sit in, sit in, sit in, sit in.  Hey, hey, ow!  Hey, hey, ow!  Ow!  Hey!  Thanks!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  I'm, hey, I don't know.  I don't know what the fuck's up to it. 
[03:03:00]  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore!  Oh, ah, ah, ah!  Get now B.O.B. and Anthony's show. 
[03:03:30]  Let's get into some stuff.  I didn't even read this story.  What's this about the Special Olympics?  Oh, very tragic story, Opie.  A group of Long Island Special Olympics athletes watched in horror yesterday 
[03:04:00]  as one of their drivers were killed when a truck slammed into their bus,  which was stopped on the shoulder of the New York State Thruway, police said.  And driver Ephraim, Ephraim, Ephraim, Ephraim, Ephraim, Mr. Williams, 42, of the Bronx.  What's wrong with Bill?  What's wrong with Bill?  How about Bill Williams?  You're trying to make yourself special, are you?  Ephraim.  You're still a bus driver. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, you might as well be Bill Williams.  He brought the dust.  Ralph Cramden.  Ephraim.  Hello, Ephraim.  Ephraim.  Hello, Ephraim.  Ephraim.  I'm hauling a bunch of retards, Ephraim.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  There was a lot of hope in that hospital.  They're athletes.  Kid comes out, I got the perfect name.  Ephraim.  Ephraim.  It means some. 
[03:05:00]  I'm sure it's special.  He never knew that 42 years later, he'd be crushed while driving pants shitters.  Well, poor Ephraim, Williams, 42 of the Bronx, crushed between buses when a box truck swerved into the southbound shoulder and rear-ended the second bus.  Leave that a truck full of women.  A box truck.  So apparently two buses full of Special Olympics people there. 
[03:05:30]  One of them peters out.  The other bus pulls up behind it.  Now the driver of the first bus gets out, starts working on his bus.  A box truck hits the second bus that's behind him.  And the bus then goes forward.  Goes forward.  Lurches.  Oh, and just nails this guy.  This should have had one of the kids working on the bus.  I want to crush that skull.  The brush.  You would have seen two damaged buses with half a head print in each and the kid walking away. 
[03:06:00]  What happened?  The buses were totaled minor injuries.  I'm on an ice cream cone.  What happened?  I love the next line.  Wait, are you reading all the lines?  They didn't highlight the best lines in the story.  It was a scene I had never seen before, the damage that was done.  At this point, why would they highlight the one line that says the athletes were frightened?  And just to hear that they were between the two buses were terrible, said Heidi Lindsay,  Long Island director for the Special Olympics.  Lindsay said that she was in a van ahead of the buses at 11 a.m. when the injuries occurred. 
[03:06:30]  The athletes were frightened.  They keep using that word.  But the coaches were absolutely phenomenal, helping them to stay calm.  How hard could it have been?  I'm scared!  I'm scared!  Cookie, okay.  I was going to go with a pinwheel.  You know, it's...  The whole bus under control with a pinwheel.  Yeah, yeah, that's phenomenal, all right.  Jesus.  The embarrassing thing is from the, what I'm reading from the EMS people that showed up  and started putting ice on all their tongues until they realized it wasn't swelling. 
[03:07:00]  About 40 athletes and 10 coaches were involved.  It was a great weekend, but a tragic way for it to end.  I guess the guy driving the box truck struck the rear. 
[03:07:30]  Collision caused the bus to move forward.  We went through that already.  He suffered severe head injuries.  Yikes.  Coach driving another bus jumped out of the way.  The athletes who range from age 13 to 50...  That's the chess team.  13 to 50? 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  I arrived back in Nassau County last night after being transferred to other buses.  Some of the athletes were too afraid to ride in the rear of the bus.  Of course they were.  But they all got home safe.  Unfortunately, said some parents.  I love the fact that the woman, Lindsay, who was running the whole thing, was in a van ahead of the buses.  Because she's just had enough of the babble and the yelling.  Oh, imagine what that must have been like. 
[03:08:30]  Anyway, a couple lines were missed here.  Chris in Vegas.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  I got to point this out.  I hope you had a great line and everybody missed it.  Did I?  What happened?  I want an ice cream cone.  That was fucking great.  I didn't hear that.  Thank you, sir.  But I wasn't the only one that didn't get a little credit.  Dan, what's up?  Oh, damn, Jimmy.  You just made me spit coke all over myself.  The bus lurched forward.  Oh, thanks.  Oh, God.  Fuck it out.  There you go.  All right. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  What are they singing on the bus?  Ninety-nine chromosomes missing on this bus.  Ninety-nine chromosomes missing.  Missing.  The eyes on the tar go round and round.  Round and round.  Oh, wait.  My head's a giant teapot.  This is my handle. 
[03:09:30]  I'm as dumb as a trout.  I open up my mouth and dumb things come out.  Let's go to Charlie in New York.  Charlie.  Yeah, if the bus driver would have had his hockey helmet on, he might have been safe.  Yeah, the rest of them had their helmets on.  Why not the bus driver?  Punch.  All right.  Oh, wait. 
[03:10:00]  London Bridge, we all have downs.  We all have downs.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Good friend.  Yo, I can't help but picture a mangled pile of wheelchairs right in the front of the bus. 
[03:10:30]  A rick-tick-tickety-tick world ding-dongs.  Let's go to Gary in New York.  Gary.  Yeah, hold up.  Gary.  No, we're here.  Gary.  Hi.  Yeah, hold on one second.  We're in the back.  We're running a business, sir.  What happened?  Hello.  Hey, Gary.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, who's this?  Open in Anthony.  You're on the air, sir.  Hey, hey, oh, Bob.  Open in.  This is Gary, man.  I've been listening to you guys from day one, all right, on NAW. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, boy.  I'm an XM subscriber now.  I was the first one on the scene yesterday.  And, you know, I dig your humor, the whole thing.  It was fucking ugly.  It was fucking ugly.  Well, I don't doubt it.  You know, you got to put a thank out.  You know, put a shout out to all the local guys that helped.  It was fucking ugly.  That's all I got to say, man.  I'm going to punch out, all right?  It was fucking ugly.  All right.  Thanks.  All right?  Thanks, Gary.  I'm sorry that we... 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, no, I'm done that wrong.  Take care.  Thanks, thanks.  Good God speak.  It is a shame that the guy has killed in the accident because people are suggesting if he  was just injured badly, he could have competed the next year.  It's horrible.  I have to do it again.  Pocket full of posy.  Ashes, ashes.  We all have to.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:12:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Mary had a genetic disaster, genetic disaster, genetic.  Mary had a kid as dumb as a ham.  Dumb as a ham.  This is just childish. 
[03:12:30]  Turn tragedy into comedy.  13 to 50.  Damn, that's a wide spread for athletes.  Well, we can play Steven Lynch as we read.  Steven Lynch.  Okay.  Dave from North Carolina is asking, since the accident happened, were they on time, but were 
[03:13:00]  they tardy?  They tardy.  Dave, you brilliant bastard.  That is wonderful.  You know, the bus didn't catch fire because it was flame-retarded.  I heard it dug up a little portion of the road, but the highway crew came and retarded. 
[03:13:30]  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott, what's up?  What?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Roll over, roll over.  Send some chromosomes right over.  But it was horrific up there.  It's funny because we weren't there.  Yeah.  It's funny because we don't know them at all. 
[03:14:00]  It's funny because we didn't have to clean up the mess.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a babble on the way home in each car.  Hey, Dave, the bus can't...  What happened to the driver?  What happened to the driver?  What happened to...  All right, shut up.  Yes.  He's dead.  Crushed between two buses, Steve.  He's very badly mangled, you see.  Vidi well, old fat tongue. 
[03:14:30]  I wish I was one of those parents.  Why did it happen?  Because you're bad.  Excuse me.  I got ratings in front of me.  No way.  Stop.  No.  Do you really?  Mm-hmm.  Are you teasing with me?  Don't toy with me.  And don't smile like that.  Stop it.  Don't flash them like that, you ass.  How did those come over?  Where did they...  Okay, flip.  I couldn't see.  Shit.  Oh, you know this is the only reason I came into work today. 
[03:15:00]  Hold on.  Mike in Queens, what's up?  Hey, I'm Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  Mikey.  I just want to point out Anthony's great callback of the Louis Anderson.  Turning transity to comedy.  Yeah, you know, anyway, I could try to cover this up.  Right on.  Sweep this ugliness under the carpet.  We wouldn't be making jokes if we were there with the shovels.  Right.  We're back on commercial radio, so we have to deal with ratings again.  Ratings.  Every month, like a period.  Now, this is the first trend that we're involved in for Free FM in New York. 
[03:15:30]  We've got to explain that the trend is three months.  Mm-hmm.  Two of those months are really, really, really bad David Lee Roth months.  Yes.  And one is ours.  Our month.  Okay.  Do we have the breakdown of just our month?  Not yet.  Not yet?  What the?  Okay.  Okay.  Will we?  Soon?  Jesus Christ.  He keeps turning the paper real quickly, and I can't see it.  I saw it.  And I'm so excited. 
[03:16:00]  Get ready to focus your eyes right here.  Ready?  Okay.  All right.  Ow!  Wait, I think you can do this.  Ready?  Okay, go ahead.  Focus!  Jesus Christ.  I saw 6A.  I saw 6A.  So the trend will be two months of daily Roth that are absolutely horrendous.  Abominable.  Put it this way.  Last trend that came out last month.  Yeah.  Man 18 Plus was a 1.9.  1.9.  1.9 share.  Is that good?  That's bad.  That is horrific.  What's a good share for people that don't know radio, like yours truly? 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  A 30?  Not good.  I don't know.  A million.  Sorry.  A million share.  A two million share.  So David Lee Roth, his last trend for Free FM in New York, 18 Plus Men, he did a 1.9.  1.9, and that was the month or the three months?  That was the three-month average.  Three-month average.  So now what happens is the first month of that trend goes away.  So now there's still two months of David Lee Roth in there, and then first trend with us. 
[03:17:00]  One month of us.  So it's an average of those three months, two David Lee Roth months, and one O&A month.  So next month will be one David Lee Roth month and two O&A months.  Two O&A months, and then the month after that will be three O&A months, and it will be all  ours.  But in a year and six months, it will be a year and two months minus the trend.  So David Lee Roth, when it was all three months him, it was a 1.9.  Now the trend that just came out, the trend is two months David Lee Roth, one month Opie 
[03:17:30]  and Anthony.  What is it?  What is it?  4.0.  No way.  We doubled.  It is not a 4.0.  4.0.  No way.  4.0.  Man 18 Plus, 1.9 to a 4.0.  Do you know, that means the monthly had to be...  That means our monthly was way higher than a 4.  Way higher than a 4.0.  Because if he was averaging just under a 2 by himself, that would be 2, 4, 6.  So if we're averaging a 4, that means it's now 4, 8, 12, 2, 4. 
[03:18:00]  Holy Toledo.  It could be up to like an 8 share, doing quick math.  Jesus Christ.  But the average brings it to a 4.  Yeah, because the average is brought down because two of those months are David Lee Roth.  You guys tell me he didn't have two 2s and we had a 0.  Now, are you sure that's the three months running?  In my past life, I used to be a math whiz, but I got bored with math.  How are you sure that's three months running?  Positive.  That's how it goes.  Positive.  Men 18 Plus, they went from a 1.9.  How do you know that's not a monthly breakdown?  Morning 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. 
[03:18:30]  And it's now a 4.0.  More numbers coming in moments.  But how do you know that's not the monthly?  I just know.  Because I don't want to be...  I just know.  I'm very happy.  I just know that.  Even if that was just the monthly, that is great.  No, because they don't get the breakdown of each individual month until the actual book comes out, which is later.  These are like trends.  They just give you overall numbers.  And then they give you more detail as this goes on.  Let me see.  There you go.  1.9 to a 4.0.  Men 18 a.m. plus in Morning Drive for free FM here in New York. 
[03:19:00]  But it says April to May.  Oh, the rolling trend.  Right, right.  Right.  God, I have no idea how to read those.  So...  Like, if you would have said a 4 sucks, I would have been like, fuck.  I have no idea if that's good or bad.  4 is...  No, a 4 itself is all right.  Coming up from that...  But the fact is that we took his awful ratings, and he's still involved with our ratings, and we went from 1.9 to 4.0 is unbelievable.  That means our part of that average is way higher than 4. 
[03:19:30]  Way higher.  It's probably...  Very good.  Doing quick math is probably around an 8-share, and that is very impressive.  Wow.  Especially in the beginning.  So...  All right, we should take a break.  We'll play Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics.  It's a good place to play this as we go to break, and we'll continue in just a bit here.  Watch them run.  Watch them fall.  Watch them try to catch a ball.  Olympics.  Watch them fall into the pool that's diving at the Special Olympics. 
[03:20:00]  Olympics.  And I know full well that I will burn in hell. 
[03:20:30]  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball gotta be about the funniest friggin' thing I've ever seen in my life.  At the Special Olympics.  At the Special Olympics.  Verse 2.  Kid with downs wins the race, even though he stood in place.  Olympics. 
[03:21:00]  Olympics.  Round his neck, gold medals hung, resting on his giant tongue.  Olympics.  Special Olympics.  But I kid when I sing.  Cause these games are a beautiful thing. 
[03:21:30]  Okay, really, I'm just avoiding karma, cause I know my children could be born crippled and blind, and so am I retired?  I'll have to spend all my time.  At the Special Olympics.  I feel so guilty, I can't even tell you.  And now, Reflections on James Norton.  With Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girl.  Walking in the park, hand in hand. 
[03:22:00]  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the spoon position.  Alright!  Oh, little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on the blue with him, Kramer!  On the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We just got a report that they're jumping up and down at 3FM in New York City. 
[03:22:30]  Wow!  Over here, maybe you guys don't care as much, but we went back to commercial radio.  That caused a lot of chatter.  A lot of chatter.  Well, it caused a lot of chatter.  And the first trend with us in it came out today, and Men 18 Plus, or Men 18 of 49, I'm not sure, but it's Men 18 Plus at least.  It's the demo we're gunning for.  I guess so.  The trend went from a 1.9 to a 4.0.  The 4.0 still has two of David Lee Roth's awful, awful months in there. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  And one of our months.  And I quickly did the math on the radio, said that means we had to do about an 8 ourselves.  And a lot of people are confirming that through their own mathematics.  Dennis from Maryland.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  If you take 1.9 and you average it out to two months, they're 1.9 plus 1.9.  And then you take 8.2 and divide it by 3, you guys got an 8.2.  Yeah.  But the month we lost, that's why I'm saying about an 8, because the month that David Lee Roth, it could have been his worst month, it could have been his best month, it could have been, we could have lost maybe a 1.0 there. 
[03:23:30]  We don't know for sure.  So it's not necessarily a 1.9, 1.9, right.  We just know we did way better than the two months he had in that trend.  Oh, yeah.  So that's why we're saying about an 8.  About an 8.  Van Halen, old Van Halen is my favorite band, but you guys fucking rock.  David Lee Roth sucked ass.  That wasn't his thing, but thank you, man.  Poor Dave. 
[03:24:00]  It wasn't his genre.  I just wish that he would be more accurate and humble when describing what happened.  He could go, look, it was just tougher than I thought, and I really wasn't as prepared.  Instead of going, like, we were bringing something fresh.  He looks like a buffoon.  He wasn't fresh.  He was on The View.  He was on The View doing the exact same thing he did on Leno with his band playing with The View girls watching.  And I saw the clip and was horrified.  I was trying to think of, like, the top rock and roll disgraces after time has passed by. 
[03:24:30]  Like, I don't even know what to call it.  That's too wordy, obviously.  But something like Ann Wilson from Heart getting fat over time.  Like, just when you took something that was so cool.  You know, when Heart used to sing and you'd look at the Heart girls and they were both gorgeous.  Just, you know, time passed by and then you get what you see now.  And David Lee Roth has to be the biggest disaster over time in rock and roll history. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, Van Halen is desperate to do a reunion tour.  They just know they can't count on David Lee Roth to get it done.  And they may even still do it because they have nothing else to do.  Yeah.  And then you'll see for yourself it's just going to end in just a horrific way.  Are they finished with Hagar for good?  Are they done with him?  I don't think you could say for good in any of that shit.  If they see money in it, they'll jump on it once they all start running out.  Yeah, the move is to have both singers and go on tour and just try to get everyone to get along. 
[03:25:30]  Because they would make just ridiculous money.  Both singers, Dave comes out, David Lee Roth comes out, he does his stuff, does the early Van Halen.  But I think he's so beyond doing that anymore.  I don't think he's got the voice for it anymore.  I don't think he's got the stage chops for it.  I think it would be disappointing.  It's like I told you, I've told this story a few times, Blue Oyster Cult used to be one of my favorite rock bands when I was growing up.  You know, late 70s, Blue Oyster Cult. 
[03:26:00]  Buck Dharma.  Buck Dharma, man.  Savage animal.  Savage animal.  You want to talk about a savage animal.  I'm burning, I'm burning for you.  Well, not their pussy song.  Yeah, give us a little Godzilla.  Their commercial stuff.  Give me a little Godzilla if we're talking about Blue Oyster Cult.  Some BOC, my friend.  Give me a little Godzilla.  The wonderful Eric Bloom on vocals.  Eric Bloom, my friend.  Not a loud version.  Buck Dharma.  Anyway, guys.  And those guys, like, were the epitome of the rock band to me. 
[03:26:30]  Loud, great stage show.  You know, just lights, rock and roll.  Saw them.  Black and blue tour, dude.  Yeah.  Black and blue tour.  Sabbath and fucking Blue Oyster Cult.  Black and blue, okay.  You saw that?  Hell yeah.  You fucking saw Sabbath in the 70s?  It was fantastic.  Yeah, like, uh, late, uh, yeah, mid, about 77. 
[03:27:00]  Motherfucker.  He's old.  Of course he did.  I was a little, you know.  He was in his 30s when he went and saw that.  I was a roadie.  It was his 30th birthday present.  You ass.  Rotgut was opening.  From mommy.  Mommy gave him Sabbath tickets for his 30th birthday.  Speaking of mommy.  You ass.  She's gorgeous.  Hey.  She's gorgeous.  Mommy alone.  I just saw her yesterday.  What happened?  She's doing fine.  She says hi.  She's still looking hot.  Everybody looking hot.  My mother's my mother. 
[03:27:30]  She's not hot.  She's a mother.  Just give me a little.  She's mom.  A little something.  Yeah.  All weekend.  By the way, all weekend, I was giggling.  I guess.  I was giggling at your fucking Sal.  That's all.  Sal.  No.  Bro.  When the song comes on.  I just get a little choked up, bro.  Wait a minute.  Oh, yesterday he's reading a Father's Day card that my mother gave him, and he's getting  a little teary-eyed at that.  And we had been together for years, and look, I'm already getting a little watery in the 
[03:28:00]  eyes, bro.  Sal.  Man up.  Man up.  Man up.  Oh, he was giggling.  All right.  Well, I guess I had it a little different.  It's still a little impressive, though.  These are the month breakdown, so what's the average?  What's the average?  One-nine to four-oh, man, free April to May.  Okay.  That's still good, though.  Mm-hmm.  All right, so-  It is just the monthlies.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, but no one ever does it that way. 
[03:28:30]  They don't do the-  That's fine.  I knew it.  That's fine.  It's still very up there.  We still doubled his month.  All right.  Great start for Opie and Anthony.  Here are the three months for the entire 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. day part, including the 9  a.m. hour of JV and Elvis, so we're sharing a little of the time slot with the midday show.  Yeah, because we are not there from 9 to 10.  Right, because we have to be back over here.  They got to break it down.  This is fucking fantastic.  They got to break it down for us hourly.  So, Persons 12+, everybody listening to the radio show in the morning, David Lee Roth 
[03:29:00]  had .8 in March.  In April, he had 1.1.  In May, we had 2.3.  We doubled his audience.  Over doubled.  It's over-doubled.  Yeah.  Oh.  Persons 18 to 34, David Lee Roth had 2.4 in March.  How did he get that?  I don't know.  And then in April, it went down to a 1.4.  And then the Opie and Anthony show for May went to a 4.2.  I believe that's tripling. 
[03:29:30]  We tripled his audience from April to May, Persons 18 to 34.  Persons 25 to 54, the advertisers love this one.  They love this demo.  David Lee Roth in March had a 1.2 share.  In April, he had a 1.6 share.  He was on his way up.  Why'd they let him go?  Why'd he let him go?  Why'd they let him go?  May, the Opie and Anthony show had a 3.4, doubling his audience from April.  This is one month on the air.  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Jesus.  This is just the beginning.  Men 18 plus.  March, David Lee Roth, 1.4.  April, 1.9 for David Lee Roth.  Opie and Anthony, our first month in the ratings game again.  I hate the ratings game, by the way.  4.0.  We doubled his audience.  Fantastic.  There we go.  Very, very good.  That's what I like.  So there you go.  That's exactly what it is.  We're moving.  We're moving.  After a month.  We're moving, we're moving, we're moving. 
[03:30:30]  Cool.  One month.  One month at a time.  All right.  So Godzilla?  Yeah.  Where is it?  B.O.C., my friend.  And they were just the rock band.  So what's the problem with the five guitar army out there, man?  Nice.  What's the problem? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  After a while, and this is going back a few years now,  I see that they were playing at that little arts theater in Huntington.  Right there.  Right down the street from F.H. Riley.  F.H. Riley's, right.  F.H. Riley's, 400 New York Avenue.  I haven't been out there in a while.  I've never been out there.  I want to go out there and eat.  My brother's blowing up.  Will they give you a discount?  Yeah.  Nothing like it.  I'll give you an appetizer or something. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, like Frenchy's Place, that fucking shit box.  Here's a free olive.  Jimmy, you go there.  You eat for free.  Bring your friends.  They eat for free, too.  Everybody eats for free.  Wow.  You're giving the place away.  I'll use some of that F.U. money.  Give everyone a free meal.  It's worth checking out, though.  F.H. Riley's, 400 New York Avenue.  And the little joint is right down the road.  Yeah.  And I heard Beloyed Stacott was playing there. 
[03:32:00]  I'm like, wow, nice intimate atmosphere.  Let me go see my rock hero's Blue Oyster Cult.  Go in.  Get up close.  I'm really, like, third row back.  And they start playing.  I forgot what they opened with, but it was one of the hits.  And I was able to...  Actually, could you turn it down even lower?  Hi, Opie.  I was able to carry on a conversation just like this during the concert.  Listening to Blue Oyster Cult...  So, what do you think of the show?  It's pretty good, man.  You want a beer?  I'm buying it. 
[03:32:30]  I know this song.  Let me listen.  You're sure that wasn't your rock and roll ears?  You just can't hear anymore, man?  No.  This is about the volume it was at.  And I don't know where Blue Oyster Cult went, but there were some old guys on the stage.  Yeah.  And believe me, I loved them like no other band.  But you kind of want to remember that.  So, David Lee Roth, I want to remember.  If you took a video of David Lee Roth back in his heyday with Van Halen and then compared it right next to each other with that David Lee Roth performance on The View of him with the Hillbilly Band doing that, it is probably the biggest disgrace in rock and roll history. 
[03:33:00]  And I've been trying to come up with like a list to compile a list of the biggest rock and roll disasters like that.  Because, I mean, it's better.  It's so much better that Morrison's dead, Hendrix is dead, because God only knows what type of embarrassment they'd be making of themselves over the years. 
[03:33:30]  Me and I point out what band still tours and still kicks ass.  The Rolling Stones.  Yeah, they kick ass.  U2, who was around in the early 80s and now still is relevant and as big as they ever were.  Bigger now than they ever were and never had a lull in their career.  That's right.  Amazing, Jim, that you even brought up U2 like that.  What?  The Who still touring.  I mean, okay, there's only two of them left, but. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, they're the.  It's like, now this name really makes sense.  Who's on bass and who's on drums?  I have no clue.  Who are you?  Yeah, that's what they do.  How do you come up with who's on bass and who's on drums?  It's just around Roger Daltrey.  Who are you?  Who, who, no, I mean really.  Who the fuck are you?  I'm Ted the bassist.  Well, who the fuck are you?  I saw Kiss and then I got back together.  It's not the same because they're older and they look odd in the makeup, but. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  They still put on a great concert, man.  I saw him, like, recently, what, five years maybe?  Recently.  We saw him in Boston.  We saw him in the garden.  We saw him in the garden, yeah.  And.  So that was at NAW?  Yeah, about 2000.  Yeah.  2001.  They were still Kiss.  It wasn't like, oh my God.  Huge stage show, lights, you're at the garden, it's packed.  That is still, to me, like a rock show.  Even though, you know, I was never a huge Kiss fan, it was still what it was.  They can't move like they used to, Sabbath either, but they're still, they're still like 
[03:35:00]  the band being, they still have the same vibe to them that they always had.  Are you kidding?  Are they still playing?  Is this their tour list?  Who's this?  Blue Oyster Cult?  Galt Airport?  Pendleton, Oregon, to fucking El Paso, Texas, at the Downtown Street Fest?  Oh my God.  How the mighty have fallen.  Ingram County Fair in Mason, Michigan, on Tuesday, 8-1-0-6. 
[03:35:30]  You can see Blue Oyster Cult at the airport.  That's when we're going to be at the Air Force Base.  Oh.  Do we have a bigger dressing room than the fucking puppets?  If I tell them once, I tell them a hundred times, it's Blue Oyster Cult first, and then  puppet show.  They're living our lives now.  Holy shit.  God in Detroit, what's up? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up, man?  Anthony had made a comment about David Roth just not being able to handle his vocalized  Van Halen.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  I have seen Van Halen 13 times.  Uh-huh.  I've seen it.  Well, I've actually seen Dave 13 times, five times with Van Halen.  Seen Van Halen with Sammy Hagar.  Then I've seen Dave solo three times.  Oh, shit.  Dave does a better job now than he did back with Van Halen.  Yeah.  He can definitely cover the bill.  You know something?  Get me the clip of him on The View singing Jump.  Do we have that?  That country thing.  Because he goes, when he says, see me standing here, I got my back end so wrecking my shine. 
[03:36:30]  My shine.  He goes so off key.  And not only that, when Sammy Hagar...  Don't you see what I'm on?  I remember...  Mine.  What the hell is he saying?  When Sammy Hagar was singing with Van Halen, Sammy's range is amongst the best of any singer  ever, ever, ever.  The guy can hit notes that no one else can sing.  Whether you like him or not, his range is amazing.  And I heard David Lee Roth singing Jump. 
[03:37:00]  And it looked to me like he was trying to hit notes to try to be as impressive as Sammy's  range is.  And it was a disaster.  And let's be honest, too.  David Lee Roth is two years away from wearing an ascot.  Yeah.  He was wearing the little button-down shirt with his, I want to be a dentist, Rudolph,  hairdo.  And that fucking smile he puts on, in between everything, where did that come from?  I don't remember ever seeing that in the 80s.  Fucking tens for 35 years. 
[03:37:30]  That dopey big smile.  He just recollects one of them.  Genetically, it just happens.  Your body just knows.  No matter what you're doing, pussy is not far away.  All right, I'll give him that.  After you fuck your thousandth ten, you get a permanent smile on your face.  It's a little known fact.  Hold on, guys.  Yeah, okay.  Playing live, sure, vocally is important.  And maybe Dave can't hit the nose like he used to.  But, oh, like, Sammy Hagar, every time you see him, he's wearing a stick of pajamas.  It's like, just give it up.  I'm not talking that Sammy Hagar isn't an asshole or dresses like a douche.  Yeah, but, dude, you've never seen David Lee Roth live. 
[03:38:00]  How do you know?  I've seen David Lee Roth 13 times.  Oh, shit.  Phenomenal.  He's just fucking good.  Phenomenal.  All right.  All right, Scott.  He was great in his day.  He was great in his day.  I saw Van Halen, Nassau Coliseum.  Unbelievable.  I was like, my jaw hit the ground.  It was amazing.  Phenomenal, yeah.  He was jumping off of big stacks of the PA doing spinning kicks.  That was back in the old days, my friend.  Nowadays, he stinks.  They toured with Sabbath in, like, 78 when Sabbath was ready to go. 
[03:38:30]  All the black and blue tour, Jimmy.  Black and blue.  That's what boys are called.  I'm talking about.  Well, dude, when's the last time you saw David Lee Roth sing?  Say it again?  When's the last time you saw him live?  Yeah.  Last time I saw David Lee Roth live was 2003.  Oh, shit.  But I'm telling you, hey, you know what?  If he comes around, if you want to, go check him out.  Sorry, dude.  You saw it again because I want to hear your opinion.  I like David Lee Roth.  I like him.  You saw him with Van Halen. 
[03:39:00]  But you're talking 25 years, dude.  Yeah.  You haven't seen David Lee Roth sing live in 25 years?  Yeah.  I've seen, like, I've seen, yeah, like you said, I've seen him.  The first tour I saw was Fair Warning.  Oh, shit.  But I'm an old man.  I saw a diver now.  It was great.  It was great.  Anyway, find thebarricade.com for live concert.  So, wait, you saw him in the 70s, right?  Well, no, it was Fair Warning Tour, so that was 80.  Oh, shit.  And then you haven't seen him in 20 years? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  No, I saw him.  I've seen him.  I just saw him two years ago.  Oh, shit.  I don't know, man.  I tell you what.  I'm going to be photographing him in Detroit.  Oh, shit.  Behind thebarricade.com.  Check it out.  And I'm going to check it out.  Bullshit, dude.  I'll punch it out later.  I love this bullshit.  I'll punch it out.  Let's say hi to Pete Pappalardo.  Speaking of legendary tours, guys.  I'm sorry, by the way, to the audience about my nose. 
[03:40:00]  I'm horribly congested because of my allergies.  I'm sniffling, and I can't breathe if I don't.  Poor baby.  By the way.  I apologize.  By the way, to the audience, if you've been thinking about taking a piss break, this would  be the time.  Go ahead, Pete.  Oh, Jesus.  I was just calling to give you guys your updates on the counts.  Cool.  All right.  Well, and I also brought in, I think you guys know Jeff Gordon from Philadelphia.  Oh, shit.  Jeff, say hello.  What's up, fellas?  Jeff.  Hi, Jeff.  Hi, Jeff.  Pretty fucking exciting.  I can say that, can't I?  Yep.  You certainly can.  You're talking about the Opie and Anthony traveling virus, the comedy event of 2006, 
[03:40:30]  right?  Yep.  Some pretty unprecedented, huge, massive counts, ticket sales.  Really?  Jeff Gordon, what do you think about the drafting rule?  Oh, he's not that.  Oh, stop it, you.  That's silly.  I thought he was an ask for Jeff Gordon.  We have two shows in August, according to Steve.  August.  August.  I would try to wake up by drinking some coffee.  August 5th, we're at the Worcester Centrum in Boston, and August 26th, we're at the PNC Bank 
[03:41:00]  Arts Center in Jersey.  September 9th, we're at the Tweeter Center across the river there in Philly and Camden,  New Jersey.  Which, by the way, guys, in PNC, it looks like we don't have any pavilion seats left.  It looks like you guys sold out the pavilion already.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  Pretty big.  And to look at the lineups, it's all the comedians you know and love from this radio show for  the most part.  The lineups are up on the Ticketmaster website.  Yes, they are.  And opianathlete.com, okay?  So we don't have to go through the lineups, basically, right now.  No, and Camden, Jeff, what do you got down there?  You got under 2,000 seats up there, too.  Yeah, under 2,000 seats left, and then we're going to the line. 
[03:41:30]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Excellent.  Fucking huge.  Really, really, really great.  So you're happy?  I'm more than happy.  Is the phone still ringing like crazy?  Like crazy.  Like crazy.  So how many tickets have we sold at the PNC?  We're trying to clean up the holes, but you're probably pushing close to seven right now.  7,000?  Are you kidding?  Are these like fat numbers for the show to make us look good, or is this real?  No, that's pretty real.  That's pretty real.  I mean, you go on the Pavilion 6,800.  Oh, we're not going to go there and go, guys, good news. 
[03:42:00]  We sold 285 tickets.  No, no, no.  These are real numbers, give or take 1,000?  No, give or take probably 200 or 300.  All right, that's very nice.  Give or take five grand.  We've actually sold 2,100 tickets, less the whole tour combined.  You have seven tickets sold in Boston.  Actually, Boston, we're just about 2,000, so Boston picked up a little bit.  Boston's a little slow, though, right?  Come on, Boston.  Yeah.  Take the trip out.  We understand.  We know it's a ghetto, but we're going to be there.  We know.  We'll get there safely. 
[03:42:30]  No, stop.  All right, and Philly's doing well.  How many tickets totaled down there?  Philly, we're just around 4,000.  I have about 2,000 seats left, and then we're going to, you know,  just start popping the line.  How many total seats are we trying to sell for these things, boys?  Well, can't.  Oh, nice.  Perfect question.  Oh, excellent.  Beautiful execution on the hang-up.  I know, Pete.  He was all revved up to chat.  He's still talking, and Jeff's going,  he asked, they hung up on you.  They hung up, idiot.  Back to the real Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:43:00]  But it is cool.  We can't wait.  It's the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  The line-up, excuse me, are on OpieandAnthony.com, Ticketmaster.com,  and it's presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Ugh.  Ugh.  By the way, on Free FM, you guys don't hear it on XM because you hear bits.  There's a Wawa commercial.  And I don't have a problem with Wawa.  Just the commercial itself.  Awful.  It's fucking the Wawa bar of a guitarist. 
[03:43:30]  Everything they say goes, wah.  How's it going?  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  So come get some coffee.  Wah.  And then get a muffin.  Wah.  And then suck a dick.  Wah.  And your AIDS.  Wah.  In August.  Wah.  It's the fucking worst.  Whoever in advertising came up with that campaign should have their fucking feet smashed.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  They think it's product association, but it's horrible.  So you hear it and you'll know it. 
[03:44:00]  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  All I think is Jewish women complaining.  Wah.  Wah.  Wah.  Hey, Jimmy, by the way, we want to play your clips from Lucky Louie.  Wah.  From last night's show.  But I haven't.  You have to let people see it first, Frank.  I have to DVR.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to explain to everybody.  Like, we did this last week.  Everyone got mad at us because they DVR'd and they want to see it today.  So, you know, check out Lucky Louie HBO.  Yeah.  And then we'll play Jimmy's clips tomorrow.  Ooh.  Tomorrow.  Okay.  So you got time to, you know, see it tonight before we wreck it for you. 
[03:44:30]  Okay.  And then we'll enjoy Jimmy's part in the show.  My potty mouth.  We got some Jay-Z stuff that we didn't get to last week because we were so busy.  The rapper?  Jay-Z boycotts Cristal.  How do they say it in the hood?  I have no idea.  Are they just calling it Cristal?  Or is it Cristal?  Crissy?  Or Crissy.  So he's boycotting Cristal.  Why?  I don't know.  I think they're too white or something.  Or the company doesn't want to wreck it. 
[03:45:00]  There's some weird thing going on.  The association?  They don't want the association.  So Jay-Z's like, I don't know, starting a movement.  The Crissy has been huge in the rap community.  They love the Crissy.  Bottles of it.  They bring out thousands and thousands of dollars they spend in the club.  With the Crissy.  With the buh.  In the club.  And yeah, Cristal is known now as kind of the hardcore rapper champagne.  I prefer the Dom Perignon.  And Puff Daddy started that whole thing, man. 
[03:45:30]  That guy, I gotta say, he fucking, he touches something.  If he became an O&A fan, do you know how big we would get?  It's P. Diddy now.  I don't know.  I call him Sean.  P. Diddy.  Sean Holmes.  He is not.  He is.  A friend of yours.  He is.  Nice that the guy was able to build a career after the death of Biggie.  He was, no, he was Biggie's, he was the guy, like the little dog that went,  what do you want to do now?  What do you want to do now?  To Biggie.  That was him.  He wasn't the tough guy, fucking that he, uh, smooth motherfucker that he is now. 
[03:46:00]  He was Biggie's little bitch guy that used to run around him.  What do you want to do today, Biggie?  What do you want to do?  Shut up.  Okay.  Okay, Biggie.  I'll shut up.  Hey, what do you say with Chase Katz?  We'll chase Katz today, Biggie, okay?  Psh.  Shit up.  That was him.  And now, he's all smooth and shit.  He wrote that one fucking song.  That's all I know.  He wrote one song.  And then the rest of his career has been being a smooth motherfucker.  Every breath you take.  That was it.  He took Sting's song, wrote his song. 
[03:46:30]  Silly me.  He took Sting's song.  And then just rapped over the good parts.  Rapped over the good parts.  And, uh, had a career where all of a sudden he was the shit.  It just shows you we don't, we don't get, uh, the other side.  I don't get it.  Why is that a good song?  It was a good song when it was just a police song.  Every breath you take.  I miss you, my brother.  I'm Mrs. You.  I liked it.  I gotta be honest.  I liked it as a little rap.  Didn't get all teary-eyed.  No, you didn't.  No, I didn't get teary-eyed.  Bullshit.  I would tell you.  Do you crank it up and go, listen to the words? 
[03:47:00]  Here it is.  I like doing Jimmy's best dance.  Like, they slowed it down a little bit.  A little more drum beat.  Trying with your buddy.  Yeah.  That song comes on the radio.  Ah, dude, listen to the words.  Seems like yesterday we didn't drop the show.  I laced the track, you locked the flow.  So far from hanging on the block, though.  Notorious, they got to know that.  Life ain't always what it seemed to be.  Words can't express what you mean to me.  No, you won't be still a shit. 
[03:47:30]  Through your family, I can fill your dreams.  In the future, you can't see.  If you open up a thing for me.  Reminisce some time.  Tonight, I'm in.  Try to black down for the pain to get.  Welcome to Hot 97.  You don't give me anything here.  I know you're still living your life.  You don't give me anything here.  You don't give me anything here.  I like this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do ya. 
[03:48:00]  Do ya.  Do ya.  Guy made a fortune.  Because his buddy there, uh...  He was popular before that, though.  I gotta say, he was big before that.  He wasn't as big, but...  Let me tell you something.  He was big before that.  Biggie was so big...  Yeah.  ...that he overshadowed, uh, uh, Puffy.  That, uh, so that when Biggie was out of the way, Puffy was able to, like, cause... 
[03:48:30]  He did, but he was...  I'm saying he was popular.  I mean, I was in the community as Big Daddy James.  Did anyone really say, I'm Big Daddy James, you son of a bitch?  I remember.  I wish you were in that truck with him.  Hey, dude!  No, I knew all about rap.  I'm telling you, he was big then.  He got bigger, but he was popular then.  He was short...  Puff Puff was...  And Biggie's stuff is still fat, yo.  Well, a lot of people, what's the word, um, they'll say it's, uh, it's hip.  It's, uh, off the chain.  It still works today, yo.  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  Um...  No Kajagoogoo.  Wow.  What is?  Please.  What is?  So you wanna hear about Jay-Z, you know...  Yeah.  Boycotting the crystal.  Yeah.  I don't know any of Jay-Z's stuff.  Like, I know I've heard it, and I don't know any new rap.  Can I understand this?  After Just Ice, I put rap down.  By the way, Video of the Day, they do it every morning.  You get your Video of the Day on TV.  Yes.  Big ups to the white kid with the goofy hair that, uh, that took a beating and, uh, seemed  to take it all right.  Aw, poor kid on the bus.  Didn't he have hair you just wanted to tussle?  I wanted to run my fingers from his ear over, and then stop it in the middle of his JFK hairdo 
[03:49:30]  and give him a tussle.  Post-shot JFK hairdo.  And give him a little tussle on top of his head.  He had a full hair of tussleable hair.  Tussle.  Tussle.  Tussle.  Tussle.  But he's on the school bus, and they have a video surveillance of the school bus, and  apparently some, uh, black kid is sitting, uh, in the seat next to his.  And he reaches over and pushes the kid.  And the kid says something, or pushes him back.  Pushes him back.  Like, he didn't take any guff, that kid.  That's right.  And he was a small kid.  And he's like a little white kid. 
[03:50:00]  And he didn't take anything.  And at some point, the black kid just gets up and starts pounding on this kid.  Both fists.  He's gotta be a...  It looked like...  It looked like he was, like, twice the size.  Twice his age.  I think he was in the sixth grade, and he was probably 25 years old.  And the little kid put his back, I guess, towards him, because he didn't really take  much damage, and he was taking some shots.  And then he just...  The black kid backed off, went back to his seat, and the little white kid just kind  of looked at him.  Like, gave him a kind of a look.  It looked like he was getting pummeled, and then the kid just kind of popped up. 
[03:50:30]  And his hair...  He looked like...  He had hair like...  Like, uh...  Wait, wait.  There's Greg Peter and...  Who's the little one?  Bobby.  Bobby.  He had hair like Mike Luckenlund.  Mike Luckenlund.  In the later episode.  Mike Luckenlund.  Mike Luckenlund.  Wait, what's his real name?  Mike Luckenlund.  Luckenlund.  Luckenlund.  Mike Luckenlund.  Mike Luckenlund.  Who is Peter, his real name?  Peter is Christopher Knight. 
[03:51:00]  Christopher Knight.  Christopher Knight.  Mike Luckenlund.  He's called...  He wants to know where Barry Williams is.  Barry Williams, Christopher Knight, Michael Luckenlund.  Susan Olsen.  That was...  Little Cindy.  Cindy.  Michael Luckenlund.  And who is Jan?  Jan Brady.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum.  Awful name.  And of course, who's Marsha?  Maureen McCormick.  Maureen McCormick.  Maureen McCormick.  Maureen McCormick.  And who is Mike Brady? 
[03:51:30]  Boop.  He's the Crypt Keeper.  Let's go to Black Guy in Connecticut.  Black Guy in Connecticut.  Hey, Black Guy.  I want to correct my white buddy.  Please.  It's Chrissy or Cristal.  It's just Chris.  Just Chris now?  And I wanted Jim Norton to finally admit that Lucky Louie sucks.  It's an awful show.  You don't like Lucky Louie?  It's not meant for your people, sir.  No, no, no.  I like it.  I know there's black characters in it, but it's really not meant for black people. 
[03:52:00]  It's not meant for intelligent college students.  Although you sound...  Yeah, you're from Connecticut, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I hated Lucky Louie.  I thought it was my show.  You don't have any hood in you, sir.  Yeah, you don't sound like a black guy.  Black people from Connecticut is really...  It's a different breed of black guy.  Yeah, like you have no street cred.  I have plenty of street cred.  You'd be beat up like a black...  Like a white guy if you went into like the Bronx.  No, no.  Every night I've got to keep my black card by just scaring some random white...  Do you have like a black voice that you put on in front of the homeboys? 
[03:52:30]  Nah, not really.  Come on.  Because that voice is one of those,  Hey, I'm going to put the banana up your tailpipe?  No, you can default to it on an angry situation.  Like if a white guy mouths off at the movie theater.  Yeah?  But he's like, shut up.  Crack him.  Nah, that ain't pulling it off.  Yeah, that didn't sound good.  Do you know what?  Nice big house.  Both parents.  They work.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, your father's like a professional guy, right?  Both parents.  College grads.  Yeah.  You're like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  You're the black girl of Connecticut.  That's the sick time you should watch, sir. 
[03:53:00]  You're Carlton.  The Fresh Prince you should probably enjoy.  That's probably more your speed.  Yeah, that's more your speed, sir.  Just don't watch it there, black guy.  You should really be pulled off the show.  Is it?  Oh, this is what the guy wanted to get to.  What is it you wanted to say, sir?  You don't have to call with other reasons.  Go ahead, just say what you want to say.  I think he's gone.  Yeah.  This is why I hate that fucking confused Oreo of a human.  If you have something to say, don't...  Passive-aggressive, that's like a woman's quality.  Just call up and say what you want to say. 
[03:53:30]  By the way, I may have hung up on him, so if he wants to call back...  You can call back.  Are you calling me a bitch, homeboy?  Because I will fuck you up.  It's just the passive-aggressive irritates me.  Oh.  That's what bugs me.  Every day.  Oh, passive, but that's...  But they all love Anthony.  The end...  They all love Anthony.  In the end, it all...  I'm so...  But that's a woman's quality.  Passive-aggressive is like a chick thing.  It is.  It's a chick thing.  It is.  It's like...  Ew.  But it always comes out at the end. 
[03:54:00]  Like, they go through the passive-aggressive thing, and then the real thing finally pops  out.  Hi, I hate Jimmy Norton.  Right.  Just get to it.  For some reason, I just don't like you as a person.  Get to it.  Sorry.  A joke you told rubbed me the wrong way.  It's like the racial humor movie.  It hits too close to home.  Maybe it does.  And that's it.  So for that reason, I'll backtrack and go through this whole thing about your show, and this,  and your comedy, but then it comes down to yourself as a person.  Not made for intelligent college, too. 
[03:54:30]  Intelligent college person.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Well, I hope he calls back.  You shouldn't have been hung up on screen.  I got it.  I might have.  I don't know if he hung up or if I did.  Whatever.  Call back passive-aggressive black guy.  That's not a black guy quality.  Anyway, passive-aggressive is a white woman quality.  Just sit back and enjoy the part of the show you enjoy.  That's right, you goose.  Right.  The rest of it, whatever.  He was gearing up to say that, but he really didn't want to get hung up on, or he didn't  really have the balls to say it, so he was kind of gearing up, and he finally said  it at the end, you should pull off the show. 
[03:55:00]  Should I?  There's people in the know that will decide when this show stinks and when people need to be replaced  and all that crap.  Don't you worry about it.  Don't you worry.  There's no charity cases.  They're not just paying us lots of money, you know, knowing that we suck.  Right.  Yeah.  Who's going to take care of itself in the end?  Here's the black guy.  But wait.  Black guy.  Did I hang up on you?  Yeah, you hung up on me.  So, dude, why'd you start off?  This is my problem.  I don't care if you like me, but why'd you start off passively aggressive?  That's like a woman's quality.  Oh, no.  It just popped up in my head towards the end of the call.  No, it didn't.  If you want me to be like completely honest, Norton. 
[03:55:30]  You should be.  I was better on any W when you weren't there.  I'm tired of hearing your stupid self-loving voice.  I disagree with that.  Now we have to go this way.  All you do is say the same joke every show.  And you're a sick freak.  And you get this whole holier-than-thou attitude.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One thing at a time.  Well, dude.  One thing at a time.  One thing at a time.  I'm not going to go one time at a time.  Why?  I'll say whatever I want.  You suck.  You can hang up on me if you have a problem with it.  Oh, you can't.  See, this is your problem.  I said something that bothered you.  You're a bad comedian.  You're not bleeding.  I'm a bad comedian? 
[03:56:00]  You're a bad comedian to the worst parts of society.  What's that?  The only people who like you on the show are the N.E.W. Hayseeds and Hicks that Ryan and Fez talk about.  I wish you would have been successful in your first attempt at suicide.  How does it feel?  Oh, he hangs up.  Oh, he hangs up.  Why do you hang up?  Oh, he hangs up.  There's nothing worse than somebody who knows they're about to get shredded.  Yep.  Who won't stop.  Go ahead.  Just hang up on me.  More of the woman's quality.  Hang up.  Little bitch.  Little bitch.  You're a woman, sir. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  And I will continue spoiling this radio program for you.  Please do, Jimmy.  Please do.  I will continue.  Tom Chiasano emailing.  Oh!  Take your confusion and take it out on the people who really bother you, sir, which is people in your community.  By the way...  Mario cookie.  By the way...  I'm having a...  Tom...  Tom, very experienced with edgy radio and stuff, and he flat out said what was the big deal with,  you know, I'm not...  You know, you guys should have just played the audio.  Yeah.  He knows. 
[03:57:00]  Thank you.  He knows.  Oh, Mario.  What?  Friends.  We can't extrapolate the 6 to 9 a.m. hours, but I think it's safe to assume...  You start extrapolating!  Extrapolate now!  Extrapolation is what we need.  If you assume they would be even higher, we are definitely off to a good start, Tom.  Very, very good.  Good.  What does that mean?  Why not great?  We're having problems.  Oh, my God.  They're going to fire us.  They're going to fire us?  I don't know.  What is...  I sure hope so.  Let's see where this...  I want to start my second career.  No.  I can't wait to start my second career. 
[03:57:30]  Oh, boy.  I can't wait.  We're in 16th place as a morning show right now.  I'm looking at...  Up from 23rd place, by the way.  So we moved up a few.  We moved up a few.  In our sights is KTU and PLJ and Mr. Imus.  Mr. Imus is in our sights already.  Mr. Imus.  Faggot calls and hangs up.  Oh, I hate men with woman qualities.  One, two.  What is this?  Those four...  Oh, the station as a whole. 
[03:58:00]  That's nice.  Okay.  But what about...  0.9 up to a 1.4.  What about...  Look at us just reading.  I have no idea how to read this.  Hi, people.  Hi, XM people.  You're listening to us reading ratings.  That's...  That's awful.  There's a weight.  There's a...  610A.  Men 18+.  Let's see where we are.  That's...  That's...  That's...  Where did you say we were? 
[03:58:30]  I can't find us.  It's a crunch, crunch, crunch.  Wait, what is that?  It's a crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.  Can we play the Jay-Z?  We'll figure that out during the break.  Black guy, you still there?  You did hang up, right?  Yeah.  Wait, you're still there?  Did you hang up?  Hey.  Yeah.  Are you back?  Huh?  Oh, you're another guy?  A different guy.  Uh-huh.  Who picked you up?  I don't know who picked me up.  I just call and say, I love Jimmy.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Jimmy, you're fucking great.  I saw your show a few weeks in New Brunswick. 
[03:59:00]  You were great.  Fuck the other dude from Connecticut.  He's just a repressed white...  A repressed...  See, I've got to tell you guys something.  We're all about even Steven on this show.  Even Steven.  Dude, my problem...  One guy called for Jimmy and now one good call,  because that's what we do.  I've gotten hate mail...  Because we want everyone to feel good by the end of the show.  What bothers me is not a guy who hates my guts.  It's got to be even Steven.  It's a guy like that who's a fucking...  We're playing even Steven here. 
[03:59:30]  ...passive aggressive.  He's got, like, woman qualities.  And this is what really is great about...  Now we need to call that kind of likes Jimmy.  He's trying to be the cutting guy who says the really hard stuff.  And then he hangs up like a faggot.  It's like...  Faggot.  He won't go...  You can hang up on me.  The end of the closet racist, we love him anyway.  That's what...  I don't care about that.  That's what a woman says to her man.  You can hang up on me.  You can do that.  Really?  Can I?  You know where's Steven?  Lucky Louie, you were funny as hell last night.  I've got to give you credit on that, man. 
[04:00:00]  Thank you, fella.  Love the show.  Love you guys from WNEW.  Thanks.  We can't wait.  I can't wait to check out Lucky Louie when I get home.  Which will be happening very soon, by the way.  Sorry that Rejected by His Own People didn't enjoy Lucky Louie, but for those of you that  do, I appreciate it.  What, Anthony?  You know we went...  Men, 18 plus.  We went from 19th place last month with David Lee Roth.  That was him.  That was totally him.  Was 19th place.  We are now in 7th.  Wow.  7th place. 
[04:00:30]  Wow.  Behind us, stations such as WABC.  I think we still know how to do this radio thing.  All right.  Jay-Z boycotts Chris.  Yes.  Yes.  The Chris.  The Chrissy.  The Cristal.  Entertainer Jay-Z and other rappers made Cristal a household name in the hip-hop community.  What an ass.  Entertainer's...  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  Penis.  Wah, wah, penis.  Entertainer Jay-Z and other rappers made Cristal a household name in the hip-hop community. 
[04:01:00]  Now, controversial comments by the Champagne's maker has left a sour taste in their mouths.  Instead of pop the bubbly, they say stop the bubbly.  Christine, look at you.  I got it.  Jay-Z's 40-40 club, Christine.  Kathleen, Harry, Cristal is like a status symbol.  Everyone wants to be seen drinking it, but you won't see anyone here drinking it.  That's because it's been crossed off the menu.  This club is boycotting the bubbly.  This one.  You can't even drink Cristal on this one. 
[04:01:30]  You got to drink Cristal.  In hip-hop videos, it's as common as the bling, the Cristal champagne.  Rappers not only sing about the bubbly, they drink it when they're at the clubs.  But they won't be sipping Cristal here at Jay-Z's 40-40 club anymore.  It's been taken off the shelves and crossed off the menus.  What's non-existent in our world?  The pricey champagne became part of the hip-hop lifestyle back in the 90s,  and even at $450, the pop, it hasn't gone flat until now, at least at this club. 
[04:02:00]  So, what's the problem?  What's the problem?  Who gives a shit?  Why would Jay-Z make a point of it?  Well, I think the next clip explains direct racism.  Oh, here we go.  It's not the violence in the rap community that a company wouldn't want to be associated with.  It's not the fact that all problems in the rap community are settled with fucking pistols.  It's the race.  That's it.  I see.  This after a big wig at Cristal told The Economist magazine he resents the unwelcome attention the bubbly gets from the hip-hop community. 
[04:02:30]  Sheldon Robinson, the club's manager, calls it direct racism.  The president and CEO of Louis Roederer made some really derogatory remarks towards the hip-hop community,  and it's very offensive, and we're stepping up and letting them know that we're not going to stand for that.  That's bad news for Cristal.  This club has already gone through 250 cases of it this year alone.  I think it's really going to hit them when it hurts.  But customers here aren't hurting.  There are now new champagnes on the menu to tempt their taste buds.  If the owner of Cristal doesn't appreciate hip-hop's business, then why should, you know, hip-hop moguls continue to, you know, buy their product? 
[04:03:00]  The hip-hop industry has done a lot to popularize Cristal, and I think it's a good idea that 4040 decides to no longer carry the brand.  Jay-Z is hoping others in the hip-hop community will follow his lead in this boycott.  Meanwhile, our calls to the makers of Cristal were not returned.  You know why? Because it's a non-story for them.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah, they were around a long time before the hip-hop community jumped on board. 
[04:03:30]  And how about they stop referring to themselves as a community?  Stop it.  Community.  Stop it.  Maybe they find they get more business, like, from certain hotels in certain places,  and when it's associated with a hip-hop culture, they get less from the other places.  What's racist about that?  If hip-hop wasn't so violent, I don't think you'd have the same problem.  I don't think if jazz musicians were drinking it, there would have been a problem.  I want to know what Cristal said. 
[04:04:00]  What Cristal?  The people.  I want to know what Chrissy had to say.  What did Chrissy say?  That was derogatory against the rap community.  That they don't like the image that their champagne is...  How about you add that to your little news story?  Yeah, maybe.  You missed out on an important...  Exactly.  You left out on an important part.  That's the important thing.  Oh, they said, you know, oh, they don't support...  Well, what did they say?  Did they use the N-word?  We don't want these...  Enjoying our champagne.  It's a champagne.  Find champagne, for the love of God. 
[04:04:30]  All right.  Are we done?  Are we?  We have an interview.  Oh, with some Columbus paper, I think?  Yes.  Yes.  Hmm.  Ooh.  You're listening to the soothing sounds of Obi and Anthony.  So sit back, relax, have yourself some herbal tea, close your eyes, and drift away with O&A. 
[04:05:00]  Hey, Ass Pop.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick!  Bye, I, I.  Shut up, shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm!  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are.  And that's why I'm signing up.
