<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about listener Stacey Keech abandoning the show due to its opening, followed by morbid humor regarding Zsa Zsa Gabor's 97th birthday.  The hosts then dissected *90 Day Fiancé*, focusing on the attractiveness of Paola ("Pow Pow Pow Pow") and other female participants, and the perceived insecurities of their male counterparts. They bragged about boosting Paola's Twitter followers.  The conversation shifted to the Sochi Olympics, highlighting concerns about the city's unpreparedness, including unfinished hotels, substandard plumbing (double toilets and improper toilet paper disposal), poor water quality, and the threat of Chechen terrorism, referencing a recent Kenyan mall shooting.  Listeners Steve (Sochi pillow shortage), Wood Floor Liquor (EMT instruction and a Philadelphia drug video), Rob (New Jersey paramedic discussing the heroin epidemic and "Bud Light" heroin), Eric (Pittsburgh medic accountant correcting Narcan dosage information), and Bob (Philly's open-air drug market) called in. The first half concluded with mentions of G.I. Joe's 50th anniversary, Russ and Paola's upcoming appearance, and Lady Di's attempted cancellation.  The entire segment was laced with profanity and sexually suggestive remarks.

The show continued with a discussion about the unrealistic portrayal of zombies in films, transitioning into an interview with Chip Chipperton, who offered vulgar commentary on UFC fighters, particularly Chael Sonnen.  Axl Rose's birthday sparked a lengthy discussion about Guns N' Roses, *Appetite for Destruction*, Axl Rose's concert tardiness, and the band's subsequent albums.  The conversation then moved to Asia, their upcoming album *Gravitas*, and 80s supergroups, including a call from a devoted Asia fan.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the last album owned before digital music, prompting anecdotes about shoplifting and a bad check written to a bowling alley, and a detailed analysis of a Radio Shack Super Bowl commercial.  The "cinnamon challenge," featuring E-Rock's adverse reaction, brought the segment to a close.  This portion also contained frequent profanity and offensive language.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured a tense phone call with Lady Di and Marion, who cancelled their scheduled appearance due to illness and weather concerns.  Opie and Anthony aggressively pressured Lady Di to appear alone, resorting to insults and threats.  Tom Sizemore then called in, vehemently denying online rumors of revealing Bill Clinton's alleged affair with Elizabeth Hurley, blaming his past drug use.  The hosts discussed playing audio of the original recording.  A McDonald's Canada video debunking a viral image of McNugget ingredients followed, leading to a phone interview with Russ and Pao from *90 Day Fiancé*. The hosts teased them about their relationship, their religious families' interference, and Pao's attractiveness, repeatedly suggesting they were already married despite their denials.  This section was filled with suggestive language and playful antagonism towards the guests.


A subsequent segment heavily featured another phone call with Russ and Pal from *90 Day Fiancé*, expressing disappointment at the show's short six-episode run.  The hosts continued to tease them about their relationship and Pao's appearance, with their skepticism intensified by Russ's brief disconnection and apparent callback using Pal's phone. A listener confirmed their marriage using Oklahoma records.  The show then resumed its conversation with Lady Di, who again initially declined an appearance.  The hosts engaged in further banter, accusations of lying, and discussion of her personal life, incorporating a listener's account of seeing her vomiting.  Bill, Lady Di's companion (described as drunk), also participated. The conversation drifted to listener calls and sexually suggestive descriptions of celebrity nude photos on Twitter.  The segment concluded with discussion of the upcoming "Super Show" and speculation about a surprise guest, maintaining the show’s usual crude language, sexual innuendo, and personal attacks.


The final segment involved a male guest, possibly a rapper, recounting a Super Bowl party with the Seahawks and Troy Kwan's dancing.  The conversation shifted to criticizing celebrities' outfits (Two Chainz and P. Diddy), P. Diddy's career, the Biggie Smalls hologram tour, and the guest's upcoming Super Show appearance.  The guest mentioned Lady Di's appearance and the show's desire for women willing to remove their clothing on air, leading to further sexually explicit comments and jokes.  Racist comments regarding driving habits and the guest's icy commute, including additional racial slurs, were also included.  The segment ended with anticipation for the next day's Super Show, emphasizing its expected sexually explicit content, before the guest departed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Damn, that makes us sound great!  I know, right?  Wow!  I think there should be a few more accolades.  You think?  Just a few more accolades.  You know, the latest Twitter asshole actually said that he can't listen to the show anymore because of the open.  Wait, so the whole show is a wash? 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  Because of the open?  It was Stacey Keech.  He doesn't like the fact that we're patting ourselves on the back.  Are you shitting me?  So he has decided that's it for him.  He's out.  He's out, yeah.  He's out because of a stupid fucking open to a radio show.  A river, our gerchi.  He's out.  Morning, everyone.  Hi.  I just want to announce that Jar Jar Gabor is still alive.  We were shocked when that came up this morning, pre-show. 
[00:01:00]  It seems like years ago we were reporting that they were cutting her up into pieces.  I think we said that in the end she'll be buried in a hat box or something.  Yes.  I think she's lost a few limbs over the years.  Lopping limbs off.  With that weird dude that goes, I've been a bad boy, yeah?  Remember him?  I've been about the boy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That guy, I guess he's still married to her?  I don't know.  Still married.  And what was his story again?  Sometimes I'm a bad boy.  Oh, he was with Anna Nicole Smith, I think. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  He had some kind of connection with her and he was all over the news for a while, but he  went away.  How much of your wife has to remain?  Like, how much of your wife has to be left that you still are married?  That's a very good point.  I'm married to Jar Jar.  Oh, wait.  They hacked off 60% of her.  I would assume if she doesn't have a pussy anymore, then it's over, Johnny.  You could definitely say.  Although, you know, I doubt he's used that for a while.  Oh, God.  Oof.  97. 
[00:02:00]  What is she doing?  Like, right now, what is she doing?  Yeah.  What is she doing?  What is that about?  It's laying there.  Well, I guess you've still got TV, right?  You know, thank God for the old boob tube, as they called it.  If you're 97 and you're bedridden and they turn that TV on, that must be like an acid trip.  Really?  I wonder if dementia and TV is a cool combination.  It might be.  What do you think?  I don't know.  I guess we can only hope to find out. 
[00:02:30]  It might be the best fucking high you could ever have.  You just don't understand anything that's going on?  No, but stuff's coming at you, though.  Yeah.  I'm picturing something like Clockwork Orange.  You're just there with your eyes open, kind of looking confused and anxious.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, it could be trippy.  But there's so much to do today, and we had to focus on Zsa Zsa.  But it's her birthday today.  She's 97.  Ah, happy birthday. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Remaining parts of Zsa Zsa.  And the other big news is that Pow Pow Pow Pow is going to be calling today.  Uh-huh.  And I guess the dude is, too, but whatever.  The mysterious guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, Russ and Pow from 90 Day Fiance.  I started following a couple of the girls on Twitter.  Yeah.  They got Pow.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh...  Curio.  And Curio.  Curio.  The cute little Brazilian girl.  Oh, is she on Twitter?  Yeah.  Yeah, she is.  Oh, yeah.  She loves Johnny Depp. 
[00:03:30]  She cannot get enough of Captain Jack Sparrow.  She can't wait to get rid of that fucking loser.  That Mormon loser.  When Johnny Depp comes and call it.  I can't wait to fast forward and people just...  Those flashes just snapping on a red carpet somewhere.  Right.  And Johnny Depp with his arm around her.  Around who?  Curio.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Around Curio.  Yeah.  I watched the fourth episode of 90 Day Fiance.  I missed that one.  I'm still behind one. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my God.  It's the best fucking show.  There's so much going on with this fucking show.  Yeah.  And Curio, Liam, she got her model shots.  Oh, looking great.  Oh, I didn't see that far.  And they're already, you know, sending her out on shoots.  Oh, shit.  And the guy, and you saw her eyes change.  The guy's like, you're not going to leave me, are you?  Oh, he's blatantly now. 
[00:04:30]  Because you're not going to leave me, right?  Oh, no.  Oh, that's never a good thing to have to say.  And then Curio, Liam, said that, you know, ah, jealous, jealous.  But then her eyes changed, like, I'm with an insecure fuck.  Wait, let me ask you.  Can she leave him for someone else and still stay in the country?  Or does she have to marry him within 90 days?  I think she's just got to get married within 90 days.  No, she has to marry him within 90 days.  What if she wants someone else and marry them?  Right.  They're not going to throw her out of the country.  That's not her visa.  Her visa is...  Wow.  When you have a K-1 visa, you have to marry the person that is applying for you. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, wow.  Why is Curio...  Curio's following me.  Curio?  You son of a bitch.  Are you serious?  You must have asked her.  No.  I swear to God.  Oh.  I didn't even know she was on Twitter.  She's probably following all of us.  She probably is, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's following all of us?  She must be.  Oh, she's just following Opie and Jim right now.  That fucking bitch.  Fuck her, then. 
[00:05:30]  Good morning, Curio.  Nice.  Had it with these bitches.  Here's the deal with her, though.  I mean, if she doesn't marry the Mormon dude, but I think she's got to marry the Mormon dude  because guess what Mormon dude did?  What?  We don't have to wait for the 90 days.  Why don't we speed up the process?  Oh, boy.  He wants to.  Yeah.  He wants to lock her up.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I be model.  Fuck Johnny Depp.  Model. 
[00:06:00]  My model.  Here is me and Captain Jack Sparrow.  Smiley face, heart, heart.  Oh, is he panicking?  Yeah.  Because not only did the test shots do very well, they're already sending her out on gigs.  Oh, that's never good.  Oh, it's hilarious.  And then we're getting beat up because people say that we're focusing on Kearley instead of  pow, pow, pow, pow.  Hey, they're both hot.  They're both really hot in very different ways, by the way.  Yes.  And the Russian girl is hot.  She's awesome. 
[00:06:30]  I don't see that.  She's beautiful.  I see crazy cold eyes, and that just fucking is a turnoff to me.  She hates that guy's ciggy breath.  Oh, she hates it.  I saw the whole first full episode, and the second one, I just, I could get through half  of that.  I just had to go to bed.  Do you like this show, Jimmy?  Love the show.  Because you're not a big reality show guy.  I love reality TV.  Right.  And you love this, right?  This one I do, and I was only, when I made myself go to bed, it was like 1230, I would  have to try to sleep.  Yeah.  And fucking, the first one, when the girl's getting her hair done, and then fucking old 
[00:07:00]  ciggy breath guts, he has a big gut and ciggy breath, and he walks, he looks sickly, like  Vincent D'Onofria.  And he just stands there, and she's like, well, I can tell you smoked.  Yeah.  And he just reeks of ciggies all the time.  What is he doing?  And I feel bad for him.  He seems like a nice guy.  They all seem like nice guys.  He's a sap.  They're nice enough guys, but they're saps.  They're all saps.  Yeah.  The guys are all saps.  Yeah.  Well, the Russian broad and Mike from Cleveland, they had the bachelorette party, where the 
[00:07:30]  mom, Mike's mom went out with the Russian broad with Mike's sister, and this  smiley friend, you've seen the smiley friend, she's just so creepy.  Yeah.  You know who I'm talking about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  And all of a sudden, the mom got a few in her, and just said, oh, my son is marrying a crazy  woman.  So then the Russian girl starts kind of crying. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no.  And then she goes, why couldn't you find a man in Russia?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, this show rocks.  The fucking...  Because they don't believe that she, you know, her intentions are pure.  Her sincerity.  The, uh, I, I, all the girls seem kind of nice, too.  Like, like, uh, Kirlian, or, and, um...  Pow.  Pow.  Pow.  Powala?  Yeah.  They seem like they're nice girls.  They just don't want to be fucking schlubbed into a terrible, boring life. 
[00:08:30]  But they seem like nice girls.  And then the Filipino, uh, broad with that guy.  See, I don't know the guy's names at all.  Yeah.  Gives a fuck.  Filipino...  Um, they went, uh, dress shopping for wedding dresses.  Yeah.  She picked out a dress that was $300.  That's it.  That's nothing.  No.  In the wedding world.  Yep.  And then this sap had to sit her down and tell her...  And she loves the dress and she's excited.  And had to tell her that, uh, he can't afford it. 
[00:09:00]  $300 for a wedding dress?  And why are you dragging a broad to America if you're literally...  Yeah.  You know, that tight with your funds?  She's like, I can't believe I fucking picked the, the, the broke guy in America.  He goes, maybe in a couple weeks, you know, uh, we could maybe afford it.  I'll try to, like, balance some bills out here and there.  Oh.  Just so they could afford a $300 dress.  So she's just fucking crying.  Basically saying, I've changed my whole life to come to America. 
[00:09:30]  And she's struggling.  She'll be struggling for money again.  I think she's struggling more in America than back in the Philippines.  Right.  Money goes a long way there.  Yeah.  $1.80.  You fucking take the whole family away.  Right.  How do you make your life worse by coming to America from the Philippines?  So.  Oh, we're going to talk to Russ and Pow Pow at 9 o'clock today.  Russ is mysterious.  Russ is mysterious and Pow is extremely sexy.  She's, she walks around like a fucking sex doll. 
[00:10:00]  Yes, she does.  And, uh, we got her, we got her a lot of followers yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  She did all right by us yesterday.  I think she's close to 2,000 followers, right?  She started around 400, 500 yesterday.  It's not too shabby.  Because not everyone's into this show.  Although we've turned a lot of people onto the show.  Especially with yesterday's, uh, discussion.  Did you see things that she was retweeting?  No.  Oh, gosh.  What?  She was, I mean, the shout outs that were going out yesterday. 
[00:10:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I think she was, oh, wow, it's 2350.  We got her, we got her about 2,000 followers so far.  That's not bad at all.  Um, can you please retweet this in support of my sick friend, Rich Voss?  He's at St. Yakov's Hospital and could really use a good luck, bro.  And she retweeted it?  Yeah.  I think she retweeted an Uncle Paul tweet as well.  Yeah, someone told me that.  I didn't see it.  Yeah, here's another one.  My uncle.  Big titted dummy. 
[00:11:00]  My Uncle Paul's birthday is tonight.  Can I get a retweet?  We're huge fans.  There you go.  My friend Chip Chipperson and his stepdad Lamar are huge fans.  Can I get a retweet?  Did you see episode four, Sam?  No, not yet.  Oh, wow.  I'm waiting until it airs live.  Are ya?  I'm all in.  She needs to tweet more photos, this girl.  Pow?  No.  Killiam?  Yeah, Killiam's two hundred photos.  They've probably been told to kind of hold back on their tweeting just so people could  guess, you know.  I'm going to speak English. 
[00:11:30]  Just so they could guess what happens with this show.  Yeah.  I mean, Pow is traveling the entire world, so there's no fucking way she's still with this  dude.  She seems like she's back in Colombia.  Yeah.  Like, she's talking about being in, like, Bogota and stuff.  Like, her Twitter looks like she's back in Colombia.  But she's traveling the world.  There's pictures of her all over the fucking place.  She model?  Yeah, I guess so.  So, basically, I wonder if this thing was set up where it's a reality show where they  get these hot model chicks as a part of this site, and all of a sudden, hey, you'll hook 
[00:12:00]  up with some schlub, and they get a guy who maybe was registered to the site.  They go, well, do you want to?  Right.  And we'll create a storyline around you.  I'm not saying that's the truth, but, or maybe they just had a bunch of people apply  to be on the reality show, and these are the ones they picked.  I would love to know, yeah, that shit.  Exactly how this.  Because I actually like the fat wife.  How this was set up.  The ex-wife I don't even hate.  Oh, God.  She was asking legit questions.  Is this a mail-order bride?  She wants to know if there's a mail-order bride going to be looking after her fucking 
[00:12:30]  fat kids.  Chubby children.  Her chubby children.  Her little, her little, her chubby children.  The ex-wife is a beast, though.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  She's decided, how can I make myself look as ugly as possible?  I'll start by shaving my eyebrows and penciling them in.  Penciling them in.  I'll give myself mo-bangs.  Mo-bangs.  And then I'll just throw red paint in my hair.  She's horrendous.  Sleeve of tattoos like a fucking truck driver.  Exactly. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So, that'll be fun.  We'll talk to them later.  Yeah, yeah.  Russ and Pao, or Paola.  Paola.  I don't know.  I love Paul.  What else is going on?  I guess, I guess the Olympics are starting tomorrow.  And whether they're ready or not.  I'd love to know why they picked Sushi.  Yeah.  It sounds like it's, it's just wasn't the right pick by the Olympic Committee.  I don't know.  It's, it's, yeah, it seems like a place that's not very secure. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  And not ready.  Not built up.  The hotels, everything.  It's not, it's not ready.  Now, I'm torn because, you know, the news channels, they're all about the culture of fear.  They love panicky.  We all know that.  You're being panicky.  But I, I just think something's going to happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think there's going to be something.  They have pumped everybody up to think that, though.  But they've been pumping this shit up for two weeks.  So you get tricked a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  You know?  But now they're worried about toothpaste bombs?  Oh, boy.  Toothpaste bombs.  How do you make a toothpaste bomb?  I don't know.  And how if...  You put it on stage when it's not prepared.  Please welcome Crest.  Boo.  Boo.  What kind of damage can a toothpaste bomb do?  I bet it could do a lot.  On planes, you can't bring big things.  Because you can probably, you can create some kind of paste out of it, right?  No.  Yeah.  You would think, you know, you get a toothpaste tube with some shit in it, and then you mix  it with some other shit, you know. 
[00:14:30]  From another guy.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, yeah.  The other shit.  And then, uh, kaboom.  They say, kaboom.  It doesn't take much to blast through the...  Well, if you're a terrorist, if you're a terrorist, and, uh, you're gonna make a toothpaste bomb,  but then the American media goes, oh, boy, we gotta watch out for toothpaste bombs.  Yeah.  Are you in your lair somewhere just going, fuck!  God, they're on to me.  Do you get really pissed off?  I would think you would.  Yeah?  Yeah.  God, we had it.  Or do you continue with the toothpaste bombs?  I think you continue with it, but you're a little pissed. 
[00:15:00]  And you ever see those fucking terrorists?  They never have good teeth.  Like, who would believe that they've brushed their teeth anyway?  Like, there's one fucking black tooth in his head.  Well, if it's toothpaste bombs, they're obviously targeting Americans.  Yeah, yeah.  The rest of the world, we all know.  No, they don't give me a shit.  They don't really give a fuck about their teeth.  No.  Yeah, that's, uh, yeah, but again, it could just be the panicky Pete News that wants to,  uh, put that out there and scare everybody. 
[00:15:30]  And they're pretty much saying there might be some people within the ring of steel,  steel or the, their, their iron ring.  The iron, the ring of, what is it called?  I don't know, but it sounds like, uh, it's very communist sounding.  It's very Russian.  And then they're saying the hotels aren't ready, but not for the athletes.  This is the twist here.  It's for the, it's where like the tourists are going and the media, they're not ready  for those people, but you got to assume the, the athletes, their area is nice and set  up pretty good.  You think, or you think it's nice for Sochi? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  But they said they're still building lobbies for hotels and this and that.  Don't you get the Olympics like 80 years in advance?  Yeah, they really do tell you.  It's not like they go, Hey, next year you got the Olympics.  You got, I think you got a good four to eight years.  They give you a lot of notice, but it's like, uh, you know,  maybe it's like, uh, the guy in school that always waited until the last minute.  Yeah.  It's like, we'll get to this eventually.  Yeah.  I don't have to study or anything. 
[00:16:30]  But they're doubling up the toilets.  And now you got to like shit next to somebody.  What's that about?  Yeah.  They showed a couple of, why wouldn't you just lock the door on the bowl?  What do you mean?  Lock the door.  So, so, so you can shit in peace instead of having somebody shit next to you.  And they're very close together.  Right.  Like you could just sit there and I never, I never understood.  Some of the bathrooms in New York where the,  you got the toilet and the urinal right next to it.  Yeah.  Like who?  No.  Who the fuck is going to share that space? 
[00:17:00]  What is that about?  How's your shit going?  Where you peek in and go, oh, you're just taking a piss.  Oh, cool.  Oh, cool.  The shitters not taken.  I'm coming in.  Look at those two toilets.  Right next to each other.  Who would be sitting there taking a dump that close to another person taking a dump?  Why do they set it up that way?  Is there a reason?  Travis, do you know why the double toilets?  Yeah, because they don't care over there.  They just don't have enough space?  One's on a bidet?  No.  No.  Those are double toilets.  I don't know why.  Yeah.  Maybe so people can get to know each other. 
[00:17:30]  But I don't, I don't.  Fine.  How do you do?  Double toilets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That, that, that, that just, uh.  Wouldn't you just wait.  That's not very American.  Wouldn't you wait the extra five minutes to let that fucking guy take care of his dump and then.  Why would you dump together?  Why?  I don't get that.  It would be, uh, very good for the, uh, maybe team effort.  Yeah.  You know, the two-man luge team could go in there.  Mm-hmm.  You know, take a dump together. 
[00:18:00]  Sure.  Maybe they're not as uptight in Russia and this is a normal thing.  That's what it is.  I think.  That would be, that's so fucking weird.  That Russian culture.  Your thighs would be rubbing as you're dropping logs.  Yes.  Yes.  Look how close they are.  Wow.  Yeah, Russia doesn't have the same kind of thing we have as far as privacy and shit like that.  Right.  They're just, well, two toilets better than one.  Now two people can take shit.  Like they have two skiers on the toilets.  Yeah.  Trying them out.  As a goof.  Yep. 
[00:18:30]  I guess two skiers that are already in Sochi for the Olympics.  That smells great.  What did you eat last night?  Oh, my God.  Your little shit conversation.  No, you'd actually lift your cheek and just show him as he came out.  Your friend will put his cheek, his face by the bowl and watch your fucking stewy log come out.  That's disgusting.  And they're also painting the grass green.  Yeah.  Because they got a lot of dead grass.  On the grass.  And they got shitty water, I guess.  They're warning you not to really use the water to wash your face. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And the water they show is kind of a yellowish-orange water.  Yeah.  That's coming out of the taps.  Yeah.  That's how the water comes out.  Yeah.  It looks like some of E-Rock's delicious cancer liquid he puts in his water.  Yeah.  Some of that goodness.  Oh, yeah.  What's that shit called again?  You mean his water enhancers?  Water enhancer.  Is it called a water enhancer?  It's a water enhancer.  Because you've got to enhance the water.  My building, every once in a while, the water will go rusty. 
[00:19:30]  You'll get that.  And then they'll send out a memo like, it's completely okay to drink and bathe and shower.  And I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  I don't want to do that.  What do you mean it's, how do you know it's completely okay?  Yeah.  What are you there with a fucking pH test strip?  Right.  I don't know why that happens.  It happens every once in a while.  I guess it happens a lot in most of your buildings.  Whenever they do work on the pipes, they just shake some shit up.  Yeah.  Boy, if people knew what was on the inside of pipes that just kind of stuck there. 
[00:20:00]  You know?  Your little filters for, right?  In your faucet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Keep that shit out.  Right.  Disgusting.  What else is going on with Sochi?  Three toilets.  The water's bad.  You got to shit next to your buddy.  They're painting the grass green.  Yeah.  Hotel lobbies aren't done.  Two days out and they're still...  I've heard light bulbs are a hot commodity.  Light bulbs.  Why is it a hot...  Because it's Russia.  Light bulbs.  We buy them on black market. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Light bulbs.  Light bulbs, shower curtains.  Yeah.  What a pain in the ass that would be to travel with light bulbs from America to Russia  to make sure you have light.  And you know that the ones we have here don't work with the ones that...  No.  Yeah, I'm sure.  What are some of the athletes getting black market shower heads too?  I hear they have all low flow.  And I don't like the sound of that.  I'm not even going to like say Seinfeld anymore.  Of course not.  Low flow.  A low flow shower head. 
[00:21:00]  What was it?  The commander?  The commando, I think.  The commando.  And they don't even have doorknobs on some of the doors?  No.  How many years did they have to prepare?  At least eight.  At least eight years.  I would guess it's...  I guess it's about 12.  Yes.  I would guess.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw one media guy tweet that like someone just like came into his room overnight because  there's no doorknob on it.  That's good.  He just walked right in.  Wow.  That's good.  Not a lot of crime over there in the former Soviet block country. 
[00:21:30]  This seems like a weird place to do the Olympics, but...  Hey, good.  And then they have...  Hopefully there will be no problems.  That whole Chechnyan terrorism thing, like fucking as a dark cloud.  Those guys don't play, man.  Oh, they are so fucking brutal.  Some say they're scarier than the...  Than the regular fucking...  Al-Qaeda guys.  The Al-Qaeda guys.  Although, aren't they associated with Al-Qaeda a little bit at times?  Yeah, they're Muslim fucking animals.  Famous, yeah.  But I hear they don't play, man. 
[00:22:00]  I hear they're fucking scary.  Do you hear what they were doing to those fucking people in that mall?  Where was that big shooting?  In Kenya?  Kenya, yeah.  And they were all Muslims, you know.  Oh, yeah.  They go in there.  They not only just killed people, they were torturing people.  If they weren't Muslims.  They were cutting their noses off, cutting their genitals off, plucking their eyes out,  hanging them, slitting their throats.  Really?  And one guy said they would take a knife and sharpen your hand. 
[00:22:30]  Like, just cut it into a point and make you write shit in your own blood with your stump.  Like, they just did these brutal things.  But no mainstream media was reporting on how brutal that was.  It's like, oh, there was a shooting in a mall and you think like, oh, crazy guy.  No, they were torturing people that didn't, like, they would ask people a certain prayer,  a Muslim prayer, and if you couldn't answer it, they would fucking hack you apart. 
[00:23:00]  Or they would say to you, what's the name?  They would say you're Muslim.  If you'd say, yeah, what's Muhammad's mother's name?  Right.  I guess that's not as common.  Right.  And I wouldn't know the answer to that.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to fucking brush up on this stuff immediately.  I'd say fucking cunt.  That's her name.  Think that would...  I wouldn't say that.  You think that would do well?  No.  That's just one of those inside things, I guess, that you have to be in the religion to know it.  But the fact that, you know, of course, mainstream media wouldn't touch on it and give those details, 
[00:23:30]  because, again, it makes people, well, you know, people would be angry with Muslims if we show what animals they can be.  Yes.  I didn't hear that they were torturing people.  Oh, terribly.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  Let's say hi to Steve in Boston.  Steve.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hey, I saw a thing on the news this morning where the local officials in Sochi are asking the residents there to give up their pillows 
[00:24:00]  for the athletes and the visitors, because...  Pillow shortage.  ...have no pillows.  Why can't they figure out pillows?  Plenty of time.  Plenty of time.  Foam in a bag.  Right.  That's a pillow right there.  Yeah, they were awarded the Olympics in 2007.  Seven.  Didn't I just get into it?  So seven years.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  They just fucking slacked off.  Right.  I like watching the Olympics.  Well, opening ceremonies tomorrow? 
[00:24:30]  Uh, yeah.  Isn't it?  Yeah, tomorrow, 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  11 o'clock at night?  No, in the morning.  Here.  In the morning.  11 o'clock here, so it's like...  Oh, right.  The big time difference thing.  Oh, so we got to do that shit.  Remember that?  Didn't we do that?  That means we'll be able to watch curling while we're on the air.  Good.  Yeah, we got to do that.  That's got to be eight years ago, then.  We should get Bobo to do some commentary, and it would be curling with curling.  Oh, my God.  Speaking of the Bobo, he's part of the Super Show tomorrow. 
[00:25:00]  Ah, yes.  Tomorrow.  And speaking of the Super Show, Lady Di is trying to cancel on us.  Now, why?  Because Colin's not going to be here?  And she's trying to take out Marion, as well.  Why is this fucking pig trying to undermine our program?  She sent me a message that Marion isn't feeling well.  Oh, wow.  And the weather's bad.  It's not.  And it was yesterday.  The weather's fine.  It's just sunny, is the forecast for Friday.  So we got to get her on the phone. 
[00:25:30]  What is she talking about?  How do we get her on the phone?  We'll call her right now.  She's such a retard.  Wow.  Right.  Men were said to have, sorry, been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before  being blinded and hanged, if that's true.  Is that contract negotiation here at Sirius?  Is that what you're reading?  Careful.  Oh.  Careful.  We took our shots.  Yes, we did.  Careful.  That's funny. 
[00:26:00]  Well, yeah, that was some brutality going on.  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Oh, the other thing about Sochi we forgot to mention, they don't put their shit paper  in the toilet.  Yeah, that's like, and then Travis is trying to say that's a worldly thing, not just a Sochi  thing.  Their plumbing isn't as good as ours.  Yeah, I guess it backs up if you put anything but duty and wee-wee in the toilet, if I may  use the...  Why won't you figure out the plumbing?  Yeah.  That's one, I mean... 
[00:26:30]  Big pipes.  They can't even figure out pillows.  You think they're going to figure out plumbing?  So what are the...  Is it just a wastebasket, or they got some kind of like...  No, yeah, it's just a wastebasket.  So you wipe your ass, you got big shitty fucking piece of toilet paper, and then you're  supposed to put it in the garbage?  Why not?  Instead of flushing it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that'd be great.  That's not going to stink too bad.  I swear to God, I just dry heat.  Isn't that...  It's really bad.  I...  What's wrong with...  Do they have at least a diaper genie?  No, it's just a...  Diaper genie is very beautiful. 
[00:27:00]  Diaper genie for your toity paper.  Well, that's beautiful for babies, man.  You don't smell anything in your house.  It's a wonderful adventure.  Curls it up in a big, what, sausage link of plastic?  Oh, you've seen it.  I'm sure.  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  A little spin around.  Goes all the way in.  That's good right there.  Yeah.  You have to cut it off and make your own diaper sausage.  Diaper sausage.  You put in your diaper sausage.  You tie it off and then I just drop that down the chute.  It goes 500 feet and you hear it go plunk. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, God.  I've always wondered if that thing explodes on contact at the bottom of the chute.  Just shit flying.  It's a big, heavy, sausage-looking thing.  It's about this...  What's that?  Four feet?  Yeah.  About four feet filled with shit diapers.  And then you put in the chute and it's heavy.  And you just wait.  You hear it falling about 500 feet.  Ours is straight down, man.  Oh, yeah.  And then you just hear this big poof at the bottom. 
[00:28:00]  It's got a fucking...  It has to explode, right?  Explode, yeah.  You would think they would send a memo out for that.  Yeah.  No shit diapers down the poop chute.  The chute sent out a memo in my building for everything.  Yeah, a lot of memos.  Oh, God.  A lot of memos going back and forth.  We noticed that your shoes are in the hallway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I own that piece of the hallway.  I've decided.  They'd like a nice, clean hallway, huh?  I guess.  Keep it clear.  Because it's, you know, for security reasons. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, for safety and security.  Or is it that you just want to be an asshole?  If there's a fire...  Yeah, my stupid winter shoes are going to be a problem.  Someone's going to trip, burn, and sue your ass.  Right.  Yeah.  And they're so passive-aggressive.  Uh-huh.  Like, I went for a bike ride the other day because it was really nice.  Yeah.  When it hit 50 for a day or 55.  And I left my bike in the hallway because it's all dirty and muddy.  I don't want that shit in my apartment.  Right.  So I figured I'll let it dry out in the hallway and then I'll shake it off. 
[00:29:00]  I'll let them vacuum it up.  And then the guy actually goes, you're not going to keep that bike in the hallway, are  you?  Ugh.  That bike.  And it was a security guy.  I'm like, what does it matter to you?  You don't live here.  Justifying his job?  Yeah.  They all have to justify their jobs.  And I know my floor, there's not a lot of people on it.  Uh-huh.  No one gives a fuck.  Oh.  They don't care that it's in the hallway.  It's nowhere near where they're walking. 
[00:29:30]  Everyone's got to be a busybody.  Everyone's a busybody.  Just get in there.  They've got to get in there.  And what's he doing?  Oh, he's putting his bike in the hallway.  Let's put an end to that.  Let's just...  Mind your own beeswax.  It's just exhausting after a while.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  CBS is halting cigarette sales.  Oh, yeah.  In our lifetime, pretty much cigarettes are going to be completely gone.  In America, anyway.  In America.  It's to a point, when I walk around New York and I see someone smoking, it just seems 
[00:30:00]  so strange now.  Yeah.  Doesn't it?  What are you doing?  Why would you do that?  And you do think that.  Yeah.  Like, why would you do that?  Why would you do that?  Even though we all did it growing up.  I don't know.  I had a cigarette, too.  But now to see it is so strange to me.  It's going to cost them two...  I'm sorry.  It's going to cost them roughly two billion in revenue.  Wow.  Two billion fucking dollars.  They're hoping to make that up in, like, health revenues.  But that's a big hump to give up.  And alcohol sales?  Yes.  Do they sell alcohol sales? 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  They're replacing it with child porn.  Alcohol way worse than cigarettes.  Period.  It's, um...  They are getting rid of the cigarettes, but unless you smoke, I don't even know where  they sell cigarettes.  How much they are, what they do.  Like, it doesn't affect me.  No, what Ant's saying, in general, he has no idea.  In general, I'm just like, yeah.  If someone told me, go get me a pack of cigarettes, I don't know how to do that.  Like, where?  What?  Where would you go? 
[00:31:00]  How much money?  We now know you can't go to CVS.  Where would you...  I don't know.  Yeah, you've got to go to a bodega.  Those newsstands, do they have them, maybe?  Newsstand.  Yeah.  No clue.  No idea.  No one says a pack of cigarettes anymore.  It's not hip anymore.  No.  But what do you say?  Get me a 20-siggy combo.  But I know where to get...  No one says that.  I know where to get my heroin, though.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe I don't know how to get cigarettes, but I know how to get the H.  Uh-huh.  Go down to Mott Street.  Your horse.  Your smack. 
[00:31:30]  Go downtown to Mott Street.  Yeah?  Is that where it is?  I guess they, uh, they, what, arrested a few of the guys.  A few of the guys.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the one neighbor guy is trying to say how he could be the nicest guy ever.  The heroin dealer.  The heroin dealer is the nicest guy ever.  Yeah.  You're not going to find a nicer guy.  You're like, that guy's great.  Great?  Really?  So if you blow off that whole, you know, dealer thing...  Dealing death to a people.  He seems like he's a wonderful, wonderful human being.  He's a great guy. 
[00:32:00]  What's the criteria for being a great guy as far as a neighbor goes?  Like, somebody just doesn't fuck with you.  Right.  Like, that's it.  They don't have to actually do anything to be great.  It's what they're not doing.  They're not fucking with you.  That's what we've boiled it down to.  And this is a big thing with dealers.  A lot of people don't want dealers, you know, getting charged with, like, you know, murder for selling some bad shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  People get really mad about that. 
[00:32:30]  They're like, oh, there's people in prison that are just, you know, dealing drugs.  It's a victimless crime.  It's like, I don't know.  There's some people that should go to prison.  But it is a stiff sentence if you're a heroin dealer to begin with.  Yeah, it must be.  These guys, they arrested if, you know, if they got them.  They're going to do, they'll do 10, probably.  Hard time?  Doing some hard time?  Yeah, they'll have to break up some rocks and boulders and shit.  Yeah, in the hole?  In the hole for a while, sure.  So the one guy had Philip Seymour Hoffman's number on his phone. 
[00:33:00]  Oops.  So they can't prove that, you know, he was the one that sold them.  Yeah.  The heroin that got them.  It's such low-level street shit.  You just can't tell who actually handed the bags over to him and took the money.  Did you watch CNN last night where they went to Philly where it's a major fucking issue?  A lot of people in Pennsylvania are dying from heroin.  Yeah.  And they went to a heroin area in Philly.  And they were just, one of the news reporters just watching deals going down left and right. 
[00:33:30]  And I think she's with a cop or somebody.  And she goes, why aren't you arrest these people?  And they're like, because we want the big guys.  These are the fucking nobodies.  It's not going to do anything in the end.  And supposedly these guys are making like $100,000 during an eight-hour shift.  Wow.  Eight-hour shift on the street selling heroin down in the Philly area alone.  $100,000 in eight hours.  That's how many people are using.  I'm sure they'll have one of those sweeps, a crackdown because they looked bad on the news. 
[00:34:00]  That always happens.  Some police chief will be like, ah, we look terrible.  My brother-in-law said, you want to see some shit?  Because he works with a gas company down in Philly.  Yeah.  He goes, you want to take a ride?  I'm like, fuck yeah.  And I posted some pictures a while ago.  I guess we're at the Rocky House down there in Philly.  It's in a horrendous neighborhood.  I'm not sure if that was Kensington, but we drove through Kensington.  I think the people down there know what Kensington is.  You saw so many fucking whacked out people just wandering around, just jonesing. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, like zombies.  And it was the middle of the day.  Yeah.  And I absolutely saw people dealing and all that.  One road, I forgot the name.  We went right down for a few miles, broad daylight around noon or one.  And my eyes were like, holy fuck.  Middle of the afternoon.  The amount of people just jonesing and waiting outside shady areas for whatever.  You know, for the deals to start, I guess.  Doing the heroin walk. 
[00:35:00]  Holy fuck.  Shuffling along.  Beyond fascinating.  Yeah.  The graffiti and the burnt out buildings.  And my God.  That's old school.  Damn.  What do you mean?  It just seems like old school.  Because we don't have that in New York, really.  No, you can't find an area like that in Manhattan, anyway.  No.  You used to be able to see that shit on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.  They cleaned it all up.  The Bowery and all that shit.  But, yeah, you just don't see that.  Hopefully de Blasio brings it back.  They absolutely cleaned it up. 
[00:35:30]  Where would you see that in New York?  Back in the old days?  No, now.  Now?  That's a really good question.  Yeah.  You don't.  You would see that shit in Times Square when we were growing up.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  When people just used to ask you if you wanted drugs?  It was amazing.  Anywhere, too.  They would just whisper to you as you're just crossing streets.  Every block.  Yeah.  Weed, weed, coke, weed, coke.  Yeah, I forgot it.  But they had names for it.  Oh, fuck.  I think the cool way to say it is, so do you want some of that white lady? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, that's what we want.  I was always the asshole, because I was such a naive, idiot kid from Long Island, that  like a guy would be past me and say weed or something, and I'd be the idiot that would  turn and look at him.  Out of curiosity, not that, I swear, I didn't do any drugs in high school, actually.  I did a little something something in college here and there, but.  It's just a natural reaction.  But I was the guy that turned around, and now it's a situation, because now the guy is 
[00:36:30]  now following me for a block, because he thought I was interested, but it was my stupid  Long Island curiosity that I've never seen any of this shit in my life.  Yeah.  That made me turn my head.  You don't turn your head.  You keep walking like you didn't hear them.  It's very rare.  I think there are a few parks still that, if you walk through, they'll ask you if you  want some drugs and shit like that, right?  And early in the morning in Times Square, they still do it.  Really?  Early in the morning?  Way early.  They make a noise, right?  Like if you're walking around at 4.30.  No, they'll go weed coke, weed coke.  Oh, wow. 
[00:37:00]  That's obvious.  But it's got to be like, yeah, if you're walking around at 4.30, and it's warm out.  Yeah.  They won't do that shit in the winter.  Hell no.  Hell no.  Aren't you like a little Chiba?  Chiba.  We got Wood Floor Liquor from Philly, a regular to this fine program.  And a podcaster.  How's the podcast going?  The podcast is going pretty good.  Comedians and porn stars.  It's not a new thing, but we're doing our twist on it.  Good for you, buddy.  So what do you got? 
[00:37:30]  So, as some of you guys might know, I'm an EMT instructor, and part of what I do is we  educate the people to save lives if people are in those situations that are doing drug  overtures and stuff like that.  So I show a little video in my class that Matt Gio put together that you can find on YouTube.  It's called Drugs, Inc.  It was part of a whole series that they did where they show the entire drug culture in  Philadelphia.  And it's scary shit.  Like, the kids in my classroom lived in these areas.  Drugs, Inc.  is pretty good.  People that they know. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  People that they know are dying left and right from drug overdoses, gang shootings.  And there's this code of silence in Philadelphia where you get shot at point blank range and  nobody saw a goddamn thing.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  If you're Jones, why would you fucking say anything?  They'll deal with that shit internally.  Right.  We don't need to bring anyone else into this situation.  So you know Kensington, obviously.  Yeah.  It's a horrific neighborhood.  It's amazing to drive through. 
[00:38:30]  But I wouldn't suggest that, obviously.  I was kind of scared.  And this was like one in the afternoon or whatever.  Bright, sunny day.  I can't even imagine when the sun goes down what those areas look like.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, even during the day, there's black people that I know that won't go through those neighborhoods.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just, there's people, I have students that live in those neighborhoods and it doesn't  save them.  When I show them this video, they're like, yep, that's pretty much where we live.  I just always figure that, you know, I'm a privileged white guy that they just assume 
[00:39:00]  that I have to be undercover and that they're going to leave me alone.  Right.  Because why else would someone like me be in that neighborhood?  Exactly.  In that neighborhood.  And that's what the cops do, too.  They drive around and then they see somebody like that, like you, in a car.  They pull you over.  What are you doing here?  I'm visiting a friend.  They tune you up a little bit.  Yeah.  Because they know you're up to no good.  They know.  Yeah.  Sorry I interrupted you.  I say, oh, no, no, it's okay.  I say cop things when I'm in those neighborhoods that people think.  Oh, do you?  I'll pretend I'm talking to my caller. 
[00:39:30]  Ah, Charlie, we got a blue 10 here.  Oppies, uppers, downers, dexies.  Oppies, oppies.  We're ever going to figure out the drug shit, you think?  No.  It's been around.  And they keep saying, I hate when you have to hear it's getting worse.  Like, you know, heroin use is on the rise.  I don't know if it's getting worse.  It ebbs and flows, as they say.  Heroin use, any drug use, it goes up and down with generations and stuff. 
[00:40:00]  But I don't know.  I think it's always been there.  It always will be there.  It's kind of the subculture.  You know, one of the subcultures in this country.  That's just a big part of the Americans.  How did we escape that shit?  I had no desire to do anything crazy like that.  We did a few little drugs, though, growing up.  If you get through that, there are people, though, that just don't stop.  They lose everything. 
[00:40:30]  And that's it.  You know?  Crazy.  Did I tell you I wrote a movie about a heroin addict?  Oh, yeah?  What's it called?  And it's the guy's big dramatic moment.  Uh-huh.  It's when they want to know if he's on heroin.  And they're like, are you doing drugs?  And he says, gentlemen, I'm married to the Lady H.  I'm going to go to Rob.  Great dialogue.  Great dialogue.  Thank you, Wood Floor Licker.  Rob, what's up?  That's the regular Quentin Tarantino writing right there. 
[00:41:00]  What do you got, Rob?  So, you're talking about people using heroin in Philadelphia.  And I called in a while ago, a paramedic in New Jersey, which is actually where a lot  of the heroin comes into the country, through Newark.  Right.  Port Newark.  Yes.  Say in my movie, Port Newark, colon.  Port Newark.  Port of H.  $100,000 in eight hours, like a heroin. 
[00:41:30]  You got to understand, if that's selling for like $7 a bag in Newark, it's like a gram  for seven bucks.  You know, you run into people that are doing eight, ten grams a day.  And every couple years, you know, you mentioned seeing all the really cracked out people jonesing  for a fix.  Every couple years, we get a bad batch that comes through.  Like, maybe, it was in the news, the Bud Light heroin.  Did you hear about that?  No.  Bud Light heroin.  That's great.  No, but I understand that Bud Light, and how's it supposed to be suing the heroin industry 
[00:42:00]  for copyright?  It's funny you should say that, because some of the heroin they found down there on Mott  Street.  Or is it Mott Place?  I always forget.  Anyway.  Mott Street.  Mott Street, which is associated with the whole Philip Seymour Hoffman case.  One of the brands was Red Bull.  Red Bull.  I'm sure the Red Bull people are thrilled.  A little of that.  And I'm sure the Bud Light people are thrilled.  Sure.  But what was it called?  It was called Bud Light?  Yeah, Bud Light would be, it was a couple months ago, it started hitting the street. 
[00:42:30]  It's going to feel good when you get the caller back on track.  Yeah.  You have to.  I like it.  Oh, he goes, so what was that guy, Bud Light?  And he's like, oh, he's back on track.  You all sit back and go, ah, he's back on track.  You can't teach this.  This is years of experience.  Because they could babble.  These fuckers could babble.  Oh, they'll ramble on and on.  Oh, and if you get one of those truck drivers, they don't know where to get it.  So what is it, Bud Light heroin?  Yeah, go ahead, Rob.  Okay, so this is something about that.  The drug that we give people called Narcan, that counteracts the heroin, right? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Usually, you give someone one milligram of it, they wake up.  Right, IV.  Easy.  These are people that you're giving them six, eight, ten milligrams, exhausting everything  on your truck, exhausting all of your supplies.  Stunning IV of ringers.  Brickets.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  What do you think about it?  That when people call it a victimless crime, and I'll wipe out the dealers and all that, 
[00:43:30]  this is the type of stuff that ties us up and exhausts all of our supplies and stuff,  trying to treat one person with stuff you normally handle, like, eight or ten.  But aren't the supplies there to do just that?  Right.  Well, yeah.  You're hoping your supplies, you could, like, spread them out?  That happened with a different batch in the 90s called Tango and Cash.  Ah, I love the Tango and Cash heroin.  Right.  Yeah.  It was a fine vintage.  Where Newark... 
[00:44:00]  Crickets.  See, back to you with the crickets.  I know.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Go ahead.  Yes.  They used every last bit of their Narcan and started getting it shipped in from everywhere  else in New Jersey.  They're like, oh, Newark's got a problem.  So everyone else is setting their stuff up.  Then the heroin spread throughout the state, and now there's no way to treat the overdoses.  Hmm.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't know.  Well, I mean, it depends on your perspective.  Fin that herd.  I'm just wondering, is that a bad thing?  Fin that herd out.  Who knows? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know the answer there, to be honest with you.  I'm just asking.  Well...  Some people would definitely say it's not a bad thing.  How about that?  Well, there are people that would say it's not a bad thing.  You know, there's always the hope that someone can turn their life around, right?  Right.  Hold on a minute.  Someone's calling you a retard.  I love when this happens.  Eric in Pittsburgh.  You're on with Robin Jersey.  Good morning, Yelman.  Hi.  First of all, dummy's got his fucking doses of Narcan screwed up.  Uh-oh.  So... 
[00:45:00]  No, it's .4 to 2, but usually one milligram wakes people up.  I don't know.  What says you, Eric?  What says you?  I'm a medic accountant.  I'm a medic accountant.  Who does that?  What says you?  Is that a Riley's thing?  What says you?  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Are you a pinhead or a patriot?  Oh, wow.  And you can buy a pinhead button.  Yes.  And a mug and a t-shirt.  Or a peck-a-head.  What says you, Eric?  What says you?  I'm a medic out in Pittsburgh, and we do things a little better than the rest of the country. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Damn.  Fuck.  How many drownings did you save in the old Three Rivers there?  All right.  You got that one.  Thank you.  Ha-ha.  Good.  All right.  Well, you're on the phone, Eric.  Jesus.  What are you doing?  I know.  I'm sorry, guys.  This isn't a party line.  We're trying to entertain people.  Just listening in.  I don't get a chance to call you guys very often.  I get a little nervous.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Go ahead.  Fair enough. 
[00:46:00]  If you're willing to admit you're nervous, then we'll work with you a little bit.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  Is it true in the medical community?  If you get off heroin, they say, how's he doing?  Oh, he's doing good.  He got divorced from the Lady H.  Lady H.  You don't like that?  No.  I kind of like it.  I've heard that one.  I'm going in the opposite direction.  I love horrible.  All right, Eric.  You still nervous?  He's still nervous.  He just sits there on the phone.  All right.  Go ahead, Eric.  He's probably a texter.  He's going to go into work. 
[00:46:30]  Okay.  Hey, thanks.  All right, guys.  Thanks for the call.  I've got to go to work.  I'll talk to you later.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  He went from nervous to completely fucking pionic.  He's going to have to wipe his ass when he gets to work from flop sweats.  I've been firmly put in my plate.  I'm going to give you the victory there, Rob.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Let me go to Bob in Philly, who also wants to talk about Kensington.  I believe there's a fine pizza joint in the Kensington area as well, right, Bob?  Well, I don't know about that, but I know where you were driving down. 
[00:47:00]  The neighborhood is in Kensington, but the area, it's Kensington and Somerset.  It was rated one of the worst drug corners in America.  I don't know if you guys watched The Wire, but if you remember Amsterdam, it's basically like that.  It's an open-air drug market, pretty much.  Every once in a while, it'll crack down on it and sweep it up.  But a few days later, it's right back to where it was.  That's absolutely what I saw.  It's an open-air drug market.  I couldn't believe it, but the area is so shitty that I just assume, you know, the police and everybody down there are like, 
[00:47:30]  ah, let that fucking place just fucking burn.  We give up.  Yep.  You know?  But people were just wandering around, jonesing, and they were gathering in front of this one building that was burnt out.  It was like out of a movie.  Yeah.  It was unbelievable.  I actually want to help that area.  I want to open a dance studio.  In the middle of it.  Do you think that would work?  Yes.  You can dance and get those drug sweats and get that out of your system.  Dance the addiction away, it's called. 
[00:48:00]  I think people, you actually see people standing up, nodding out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw all that.  Wait for buses.  I mean, there's hookers.  Trains.  You're at a stoplight.  It's nonstop.  It's, you would love it, but it's pretty disgusting.  I think Starbucks is missing an opportunity down there.  I really don't.  There's nothing but liquor stores.  Fine, sir.  Fine, sir.  Okay, then.  Okay, sir.  Maybe I can retweet my pictures from that day.  I've got to find them. 
[00:48:30]  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, there was one picture that just said crack on the side of the building.  Like, they're just advertising, I guess.  Yeah.  Why else would you write crack on the side of your building?  Well, even if you're selling crack.  I'll try to find it for you.  I'll show you guys the least.  Well, G.I. Joe turns 50.  Really?  He's showing an old commercial with machine guns and, oh, boy.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  The big news, we've got Pow and, I guess, Ross as well, whatever. 
[00:49:00]  From 90 Day Fiance.  Oh.  Calling in in about an hour or so.  Sexy.  And we'll figure out.  Well, he might be a bit.  A little mysterious.  And we'll do some other shit, too.  So stay there.  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  I was watching that show, The Walking Dead, and I was wondering if you thought that could really happen. 
[00:49:30]  Keeps me up in that.  Thank you.  Well, there are very few icons of modern fiction that are creepier than zombies.  Mindless, shuffling former humans that have a hunger for flesh and, on top of that, are unrelenting.  Some movies have slow zombies.  Some have fast zombies.  And others, like AMC's Walking Dead, kind of have a mixture.  The good news is most zombie movies are horse shit in the practical sense. 
[00:50:00]  Any virus or toxin that caused the dead to reanimate would have to get energy from somewhere to keep the body moving.  Muscles use chemical energy, and this requires a pretty constant input.  Viruses are net consumers of energy.  A virus by itself cannot generate energy.  So if you wake up tomorrow in the middle of a zombie apocalypse,  hold yourself up for a while until they all run out of brains to eat,  and they'll just fall down eventually. 
[00:50:30]  This is why I think 28 Days Later series was the most realistic of all the recent zombie movies,  and why the book World War Z wins the unrealistic award for its horde of immortal undersea undead walkers.  Barring a virus or a toxin, the only other explanation that bears scrutiny is something supernatural.  And you don't believe in magic anymore, do you?

[00:51:00]  Chip Chipperton on the scene.  Chip Chipperton on the scene, yeah!  What's that?  We're doing interviews for Chippa TV on the YouTubes about the UFC event.  Who did you want to see?  Who are your favorite fighters and kickboxers and karate guys and judo guys and mixed martial artists?  And UFC guys and that like?  I want to go see Clay Guida.  Clay Guida?  Shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to talk.  He's always... 
[00:51:30]  You're okay, right?  I'm good.  He says shit.  I turn my hat like that or something like that.  Like, yo, what's up?  We're here in the Expo, y'all.  Clay Guida?  Clay's a weird name.  What is he, live in the earth or something?  Who do you want to see win the big boxing fight?  The boxing fight?  The mixed martial fight.  I'm for Chael Sonnen, man.  I'm an American.  I got to go with the American.  Yeah, my mother always said that there's too many of these goddamn uncircumcised guys  coming in here, Chipper.  They're all uncut.  I've been saying all day, silver is gold. 
[00:52:00]  Silver is golden, man.  No one can beat him.  He's the best on the planet.  Yeah, and Chael Sonnen, they're going to change him to Chael Moonen.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  The Opian Antony Show is back.  Tighten your sphincter.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. 
[00:52:30]  Axl Rose's birthday today, 52 years old.  Happy birthday, asshole.  Ha, ha.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Speaking for all the people that had to wait two, three hours to see Guns N' Roses.  I'm going to give Chavez a passing grade today.  Oh.  But I would have went with Mr. Brownstow with all this H in the news.  Yep.  That's a great point. 
[00:53:00]  That's a great point.  Yeah, I should have done that.  That's true, though.  I'm on a night train.  That's right.  I was on.  It's not a bad fucking song off Appetite for Destruction.  No.  That was a huge album.  Holy fuck.  Name one bad song.  Go ahead, right now.  Paradise City.  Hell fucking no.  Okay.  There were some songs that got overplayed, but they're all great.  My Michelle's a great song.  My Michelle.  I love Mr. Brownstone.  Yeah.  And I'm still a fan of Sweet Child. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my.  Oh, yeah.  Same.  Yeah, this came out of nowhere.  I was like, whoa, these guys rock.  This changed the game.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I think we got our copy from Arizona.  I remember.  It was like an underground thing for just a little bit as it was exploding.  I remember one of the guys I was living with in Rochester when I had to live in the fucking attic because I had no money. 
[00:54:00]  Eric.  I forgot his last name.  Eric Olsen.  He goes, dude, you've got to check this out.  If it's Guns N' Roses, when no one knew.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  Yeah.  And we wore this album out.  What year?  Ah, fuck.  I want to say 87.  I was going to go 86-ish.  Yeah.  I think 87.  86, 87-ish.  But I believe the album was out for a while before that.  And then it just fucking hit.  And everyone knew.  Yeah, that was one of those like, all right, here's a fucking album. 
[00:54:30]  Give me the track list real fast.  Here's when you got to get.  87, right?  It was 87?  Yeah.  Welcome to the Jungle.  It's so easy.  Holy fuck.  Night Train.  Out to Get Me.  Out to Get Me is one I don't listen to that much.  That one I maybe don't listen to as much either.  Brownstone, Paradise, My Michelle.  Think About You.  Sweet Child.  Think About You is a great song.  What about You're Crazy?  You're crazy!  Anything Goes and Rocket Queen. 
[00:55:00]  Jesus.  Holy fuck.  Listen to this album time and time again.  Doing the Brookhaven government buildings over there on 112.  Really?  Installing all the AC and the brand new buildings over there.  And this was the soundtrack?  Brand new buildings.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  For that job?  This was being played the entire time.  Man.  Now I pass by there.  I went to my brother's house now on 112.  And they're just decrepit old buildings. 
[00:55:30]  It's like, what the fuck?  This is so fucked up.  I put the ductwork in there when it was brand new.  Wow.  Brand new buildings.  Now you pass by and it's like, oh, they're old buildings now.  This is great.  Seven years before you guys worked together.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  27 years ago for that job you did.  Uh-huh.  Amazing.  Yeah, but he was just an asshole.  Fuck, Axel.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  I tell the story.  I believe it was Toronto.  We went up there for this crazy outdoor show. 
[00:56:00]  It was Skid Row.  It was Guns N' Roses and somebody else.  And fucking Skid Row had an amazing set.  Yeah.  And then we sat there for two to three hours waiting for Guns N' Roses.  Oh, you can't run fast.  I was done with them at that point.  Oh, dicks.  What a dick.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  Maybe three hours is an exaggeration.  But I swear it was two.  Mm-hmm.  Like, but we gotta go home.  He didn't give a shit.  I was living in Buffalo at the time.  We had to get back across the border in good shape. 
[00:56:30]  It became a thing.  Like, oh, how long is Axel gonna make everyone wait?  Right.  And then everyone had a story about how long they waited for Axel.  Yeah.  It, like, became a selling point.  That's too bad.  Such a fucking talented guy.  Yeah.  And just, he just fucked it all up.  He should've been, he should've made a shitload more albums.  Yeah.  I guess he made one, what, a couple years ago, but no one really paid attention to it.  Then he did that Mickey Rourke thing to his face. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know what the fuck that was.  Is it called the Mickey Rourke?  The Mickey Rourke thing is anybody who just does something to your face where it just bloats  up.  Yeah.  And you don't look like the guy that you looked like beforehand.  Is it on the wall at these places?  Give me the Mickey Rourke.  I'll take the Mickey Rourke.  Where it's like, what happened?  Look at Axel.  Holy shit.  Let me see Axel.  Are these, uh...  All right, that looks a little better.  He doesn't look that bad. 
[00:57:30]  Is that kind of recent?  He looks sort of like Carrot Top out of shape.  A little.  Out of shape Carrot Top.  He doesn't look that bad at all.  He looks thinner than he did recently.  He was looking bad for a while.  He looks like he's kind of getting it back together a bit.  Go back to that picture, Shannon.  We just looked at...  Is that relatively recent?  It looks like Eddie Trunk.  It was 2013.  2013.  2013?  He's, uh...  You know what?  He doesn't look bad at all there.  He looked way worse a few years ago.  He did, yeah.  Okay.  He's slapping himself back.  Right.  Was that Eddie Trunk in the background? 
[00:58:00]  It looked like him, right?  Yeah, it did look like him.  Where?  Let me see.  Okay.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Some other curmudgeon.  Some other metal curmudgeon.  Yeah, there it is.  Look at that picture all the way to the right.  Yeah, yeah.  That.  Those are the weird, fat-faced Axel years.  I think it's more that he was fat than having worked on.  Wow.  With that terrible shirt and fucking thing on his head.  Why is he wearing...  It looks like he's wearing a fez on his head.  Yeah.  It's a bandana.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  Hey!  I was all in with Guns N' Roses for a while.  Yeah, everyone was.  And then the Use Your Illusion 1 and 2.  I don't know if they just put that together as one album.  That would be a big one.  Knock off a few songs from each album.  Make it one just super album.  Yes.  Ooh, speaking of super...  Ah, super...  Super group?  Well, the first super group, of course, is Asia.  Everyone knows that by now.  Asia.  Asia.  And, boy, did I get a lot of tweets yesterday because...  People that are big fans? 
[00:59:00]  Well, Asia's coming out with a new album.  Oh.  And the whole Twitterverse.  Oh.  Was it light?  Oh, boy.  They had to tell me.  Asia's going to have an album out in March?  Why?  Why?  That's my question to them.  Well, I can't front.  I mean, what is that going to sound like?  What is that going to sound like?  What is it called again?  It's a weird name.  Of course it is.  What the fuck is the name of the Asia album?  Back After a Bunch of Years?  Oh.  Back After a Bunch of Years.  Yes, that's the first single, I think. 
[00:59:30]  We're back and better than ever.  Oh, jeez.  Gravitas?  Yeah, Gravitas.  What the hell does that mean?  Gravitas.  Yeah.  By Asia.  Gravitas.  At least they call themselves a super group, unlike what we saw on Fox the other day.  They're calling it a merger.  Yeah.  It's Foreigner, Sticks, and Don, is it Don or Dan?  Don Felder, who played with the Eagles.  They're playing together now, and they're calling it a merger.  I've seen them on the news.  A merger of bands. 
[01:00:00]  Various news programs.  There's Gravitas.  British super group Asia to release Gravitas in March.  Wow.  Right.  Can't wait.  No Steve Howe, though, because Steve Howe is a bit on the old side.  Steve Howe, is he the singer?  Who?  How?  How?  Steve Howe played with Yes, and was in the first super group Asia.  Don't you need Steve Howe?  I'm reading the press release.  Yeah.  Steve Howe labeled a super group by critics and the media from the onset. 
[01:00:30]  It was a tag.  They said, no, we're actually a group.  It was a tag they never asked for.  Oh, they didn't like super group Asia?  It's supposed to say first super group.  Yeah, that's true.  No.  They left out the word first.  Yeah.  And they messed up.  It was their time.  It was supposed to be a supper group, because they only played in the evenings.  Oh.  That's what I jumped up for.  Dumb joke.  Oof.  I was obsessed with the term super group.  Of course.  Asia, because I got all excited, because back then I really liked music, and I just started 
[01:01:00]  thinking in the combinations in my head of other super groups that could happen.  Oh, other super groups.  Wow.  That would be great.  Jeez.  What could you have been doing instead of that?  Getting laid?  Ah.  Anything.  Anything.  Anything.  What was the combination you came up with?  I don't remember anymore.  Oh, man.  I'll just make up something.  I don't remember anymore.  It has to be the bands of the time, like those crappy 80s bands, I was thinking.  Yeah, I'm thinking.  You know, you get a guy from Kajagoogoo, maybe. 
[01:01:30]  You throw him in with...  Bob Dylan's session basis.  80s super group?  Oh, man.  Well, you know, that's when the super groups came about.  Damn.  Now I got to deal with tweets from idiots that don't get it, and will have to tell me other  super groups that came before Asia.  You think they'll correct you?  Yeah, instead of just going with the silly, ridiculous, dumb bit.  So it comes out in March?  Yeah.  You excited, Sam?  World tour to follow.  Good.  Good, good, good.  Couldn't be less excited.  Good, good, good, good. 
[01:02:00]  Couldn't be less excited.  Because nobody wants to hear an Asia album.  What's your favorite Asia song?  I don't know.  Final Countdown?  That's Europe.  Oh.  I would say the heat of the moment.  You don't go with Soul Survivor?  Yeah, I would, actually.  Solitary, whatever.  Did you like Asia back in the day?  I did.  You did?  For real?  Yeah, I loved them.  Well, you know. 
[01:02:30]  I was in, like, 6th or 7th grade when they came out.  You didn't realize it sucked then?  It was hot, man.  You don't know anything.  Yeah, they're still doing it, Sam.  Jay-Z won't be doing it 20, 30 years later.  He is.  He's 40.  He's 45.  Yeah, but how many more years does he have?  Come on.  He's been doing it for almost 20.  This was the good one.  I think this is their good song.  Listen to the vocals, man.  Turn it up.  I hit a ramp instead of the vocals. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, it's a giant ramp intro.  It's a super ramp.  That was a ramp, though.  Oh, that was another ramp.  Oh, you've got to have the big, over-the-top intros.  I've heard this.  This is a very pure voice.  Listen to this high note here.  Thank you.  That's pretty fucking good to do.  You know vocals.  That's pretty good, huh? 
[01:03:30]  It's very good.  It's very clean.  Yeah.  They didn't do a lot of shit with the voices back then.  No, they either had it or you didn't.  You didn't auto-tune British supergroup.  Nothing.  Eighties ago.  First supergroup.  Yes.  And if there is any better evidence that they're still doing the thing, I just got informed 
[01:04:00]  that you know who has more followers than Asia on Twitter?  Oh.  Bobo.  All right.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Oh, gee, guys.  So Asia's not into, you know, social networking yet.  We'll get there.  We'll get there.  We'll get there.  Relax a little bit.  Wow.  There's still plenty of time to jump on the wave, right?  Bobo.  All right.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  We were just having this discussion during the Grammy, the friend and myself, I don't 
[01:04:30]  even know what it is, about albums since...  To Moe's.  Exactly.  It felt like everybody needed to own.  Albums that everyone needed to own, and you say that Appetite was the last one?  It's the last one I can think of.  Do you remember the times, though, everyone had the same fucking album?  Of course.  Glass Houses by Billy Joel.  When I was in sixth grade...  Everyone had it?  I think I went to Sandy...  I think her name was Sandy Vargas.  I love when you come up with the last name.  I think that was her name, and it was her birthday party, and she got like three copies 
[01:05:00]  of this album, because that was the fucking on-fire album.  It was Glass Houses.  I think that was her.  Well, after Appetite for Destruction, I would argue that point with Nevermind by Nirvana.  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  Yes, yes.  Maybe Metallica's Black Album.  Like, it didn't matter what genre you liked, if you went to someone's house, they had  it.  Right.  It seems strange.  It just seems like that concept's gone.  The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack was a biggie.  Oh, that was huge.  Well, of course.  It was also Boston's first album. 
[01:05:30]  That was massive.  And Frampton Comes Alive was like huge in the 70s, as they called it.  In the 80s, your parents must have had these albums.  That's what it was.  I remember.  Why did that, the big album, you know, kind of fade away, though?  Digital.  Albums died out.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, but Appetite for Destruction is 86, 87.  That's still, you know.  And then Nirvana was 89, 90-ish, right?  Once you start getting a la carte downloads, it's over.  No albums anymore. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Why sit through their shitty fucking songs when you can handpick only the good ones?  So what was the last huge album that everyone had to have?  Mmm.  What about Biggie Smalls, Ready to Die?  Oh, I don't know.  Well, it's like the original Lady Gaga.  It was just digital.  It wasn't a physical album, but I mean, that was the one ever.  But everyone had to have it?  Yeah, I mean, it was, people were talking.  But there's a thing about going over someone's house or something and seeing the album there.  It's like, oh, look, he's got that album.  You know.  I got it, too.  Oh, I got it. 
[01:06:30]  Look.  Rare Earth.  Look at their phones.  Yeah, now it's like, oh, could you give me your phone?  No.  Yeah, I want to do it.  You really got your phone.  No.  You don't have to, like, look at it.  No, I know it.  I know it.  It was sick fucking puppies.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Of course it was.  Everyone had that in his mother.  Devil's Circus?  You want to do, oh, yeah.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  What an awful idea for a song.  It's not even any lyrics.  It's just the circus music with a lot of fuzz on the guitar. 
[01:07:00]  All right, I didn't name it for the music break, but thanks, boys.  I'm too late.  Yeah, there was a drop-off after Appetite and Nevermind.  Yeah, but I think it was definitely the delivery method of music.  A lot of people we were rolling with had Alice in Chains Unplugged, but that's a step lower  than the album that everyone had.  Yeah.  Maybe this new Asia album will be one of those albums.  Through the 80s.  Everybody has to have.  Yes.  It's going to bring back that concept.  It's time for their big comeback.  Thriller. 
[01:07:30]  Thriller was a big one in the 80s.  Thriller.  Okay, there you go.  Thriller was huge.  Thriller.  Do you ever hear Billie Jean?  Uh, no.  How's that go?  Okay.  Billie Jean from The Devil.  Sublime.  Sublime self-title was an album everyone needed.  All the cool kids had.  Well, this guy's calling for Philly.  Philly loves Sublime.  But people were downloading illegally by that time.  I had all that song.  I didn't have the album, but I had everything on Napster.  Oh, man.  Don't tell anyone. 
[01:08:00]  Just implicated yourself.  Oh, shit.  That's it.  Enjoy prison.  Fuck.  I'd be happy if they retroactively punished him for downloading Sublime.  Oh, and I love that.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, but I wish nothing but the best for Asia.  As they make their huge comeback.  They're not doing anything.  It's going to be a huge comeback.  It's so huge that the record is coming out 20 days later in the United States and it is everywhere else.  Why?  They're not worried about people stealing it and releasing it online.  No, all albums do that.  Yeah, because they know they got America ready. 
[01:08:30]  When you're the first super group, you know, you just go, oh, we got America.  Let's work the rest of the world first.  Oh.  They're from England though, right?  Huh?  They don't have England?  No, not so much.  They're bigger in America.  Yeah, yeah.  If they're bigger in America than any other country, it must be rough globally for those  guys.  No, they're doing good.  Dark Side of the Moon.  These guys are all listed albums that came before Appetite.  The bit is, what was the last album that everyone had to have before it really faded away? 
[01:09:00]  Sergeant Pepper?  Well, Our Tongue Baby, that was Pet Sounds.  Our Tongue Baby was mid-80s, right?  Yeah.  Was that it though, or was it like Joshua Tree was the big...  Joshua Tree was around 80s...  A lot of people have that one.  Six, I think.  I think Bernard Sampson's What's the Big Hullabaloo.  That was a good one.  What's the biggest hullabaloo?  What is that called?  What's the big hullabaloo? 
[01:09:30]  Guys, I got very good news.  Phones are broken?  I got a huge Asia fan on the line who saw them recently.  What?  Well, 2006, but that's recent enough.  Matt, what's up?  Hey guys, how are you?  Hi, Matt.  Yes, I've just been a huge Asia fan back to high school.  Wow.  I had the cassettes on the top left corner of my little box of the car.  Asia, Aster, Alpha.  Top left. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  Yeah, they were in the number one position.  Ugh.  Okay, okay.  You alphabetically arranged your cassettes in your car?  Wait, Asia was...  Was that a Steely Man record?  Which a fatal accident ruined his whole fucking filing method.  Yes, me too.  Exactly.  I had a stupid job.  I had a pin that I put in, you know, like you would put on your lapel and put it right  into the center of my dashboard of my car.  I just slapped that right in there, huh? 
[01:10:30]  Wait, was it an Asia pin?  Yeah, yeah.  Nice.  That's what I'm talking about right there.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm so happy I'm not alone.  Yeah.  You enjoy the first Supergroup Asia.  That's great.  Great to hear.  So when they came out, you know, I heard they were touring or whatever in, you know, I think  it was 2006.  Eight years ago.  Yeah, and I immediately got, I'm like, I've got to get tickets to these guys. 
[01:11:00]  Front row is available.  What arena were they playing in, in 2006?  Arena?  Yeah, they're a supergroup.  They just played nothing but arenas.  Where'd you see them?  Well, that's the funny thing.  Down in Red Bank at the Count Basie Theater, which I think holds maybe 800 to 1,000 people.  No, it's a little more than that.  All right.  They decided to do one of those intimate shows.  I'm sure it wasn't sold out.  Yeah, even like U2 and other bands have done that from time to time.  Bruce Springsteen does that.  When it's sold out?  And I'm sure they went right back to arenas after that show.  Right, right, right. 
[01:11:30]  They can't stay away from arenas too long if you're the first Supergroup Asia.  All of them have just become more selective.  I can appreciate you putting Asia on the same platform as Bruce Springsteen then.  Well, because Bruce did those intimate shows.  Yeah.  He goes, look, I could play arenas all day long just like Asia, so it would be cool if I  do this little side thing.  You know where they did?  I mean, you talk about a big show.  You know where they did their big 30th anniversary show?  Where?  The Best Buy Theater.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Cool.  That sounds nice.  That's cool. 
[01:12:00]  Best Buy is a huge corporation.  That's pretty impressive for Supergroup Asia.  It's probably the smallest venue in New York.  How big?  Sadly, they did not sell out the Count Basie Theater.  There was probably four to five.  You're breaking my heart.  My heart.  Why wouldn't Asia have anyone around them that says, there's no reason to spend any money  making a new album.  This is a stupid idea.  Oh, you know.  You can't say that to the first Supergroup Asia.  You can't.  No.  To fulfill their artistic needs. 
[01:12:30]  Johnny Ola took me to see them.  To the Best Buy.  All right, sir.  They didn't sell out.  Stupid, Fredo.  Get your mouth shut, dummy.  You guys know damn well.  Fast forward.  Asia's going to be in that tiny little corner doing Soul Survivor for us.  Oh, yeah.  Perfectly.  You think that?  That would be terrible.  Absolutely.  I'd feel horrid.  This is where this bit's going.  We're going to have first Supergroup Asia in this studio.  It wasn't too long ago that Loverboy was in here having slurs thrown at them and then 
[01:13:00]  performing, working for the weekend.  Yeah, that's true.  That put them back on the map, didn't it?  Oh, that's right.  It didn't.  It didn't.  All right.  Thanks, Matt.  All right.  Take it.  Fellow Asia fan.  But if Asia comes in here and they say, we want to play one of our songs from the  new album, will you tell them, absolutely not?  No, I'll be able to work it out.  Why?  They're one of those bands, you give them a new one and an old one.  What do you mean?  That's something you do to a big band.  I'm going to work it out with them. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, didn't Loverboy get a song used in the Radio Shack commercial during the Super Bowl?  I think so.  I think that was their, because the 80s came and they want their store back, was the thing,  because I guess Radio Shack is trying to update into the new fucking millennium.  And it had a bunch of, you know, 80s guys, 80s people.  You like that?  I thought it was kind of...  It was all right to see some people you haven't seen in a long time.  Yeah, yeah, like, ah, look at that, ah, look at that.  Right.  But I did like that the Hulkster was playing his irrelevant self.  Of course, his irrelevant self. 
[01:14:00]  I think he's relevant.  Let's see.  Is it Loverboy?  Let's see.  It was the Radio Shack commercial.  Yeah.  Okay.  For the record, I hate Radio Shack.  It's terrible.  What's the 80s called?  They want their store back.  Yeah.  I can't see Sam's of Huggins.  There it is.  This is it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Mary Lou Retton.  Can you pause when they first come in?  Because there's other people that I bet you we didn't even know were in it.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's see who the fuck...  I want to see who gets, like, the back row.  Cliff Clavin. 
[01:14:30]  Like, it's all losers.  And then who are the losers that are such losers that they're in the back of the show?  Yeah.  All right.  You got that guy that used to wear that fucking inside out.  Rich suit with his organs on it, with the afro.  Right.  Who's that?  I don't know.  Mary Lou Retton.  Mary Lou Retton.  Bobbing right in there.  Fire hydrant.  Look at that.  A little fire hydrant.  Yeah, Snyder.  It's Kid and Play.  Kid and Play.  Jason Voorhees.  How do they get both Kid and Play?  I saw them at a hotel when I was in Atlanta.  They were my hotel.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right, go.  I bet you we're going to see someone that is just in the background. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Let's see.  They're going to the...  Oh, right there.  Okay.  Who's that behind everybody?  Cliff Clavin.  That chick.  Eric Estrada.  Eric Estrada.  Eric Estrada has punch.  He looks fucking good, man.  Hulk Hogan.  The Hulkster.  The Hulkster.  Who's the chick that you can barely see?  Yeah, in the back.  Right there.  Yeah, who's that?  Oh, Sergeant Slaughter is at the Hulkster.  Wow.  Did you know that's it?  Absolutely not.  That's why I want to do the freeze frame.  That's smart.  Who is that? 
[01:15:30]  Who's that chick in the middle?  Is she the chick that sang, uh, My Baby Takes the Morning Train?  Oh, my God.  I hope so.  I don't know.  It might be.  If that is her, I'm going to bash you at the fucking butt of your own weapon.  If you pick that out.  Now, that's the song.  I don't know.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Keep going.  I don't know who that is.  Now they're running around the store soon.  All right.  Mary Lou Retton.  Again, okay.  Oh, there's the Devo guy.  Devo guy from Devo.  Jason Voorhees again.  Who's that guy with the nose? 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Who's the guy with the nose?  Oh, he's the guy with the organs on his inside out guy.  Oh, they got all the Devo guys.  Oh, the raisins of California raisins.  Oh, I hated those raisins.  You think those are the real Devo guys or fake ones?  They go fake.  Yeah.  Yeah, me too.  They're like roids.  Oh, absolutely.  Like three roids somewhere.  California testicular cancers.  Yeah, the California tumors.  The California stage fours.  It's terrible.  You were a California raisins guy?  They were really trying to make raisins sound delicious. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  They're not.  They're still a side thing.  You throw them maybe on oatmeal or something.  No one sits around eating raisins unless you add like nuts to it or something and chocolate  chips and yogurt chips and the raisins by themselves suck.  So you're saying raisins are not a standalone dried fruit?  No.  Would you lick raisins out of a stinky vagina to freshen it up?  Oh, well.  Like you take the pussy lips and you mush them together to get the raisin juice on them?  Yeah.  I'd love that. 
[01:17:00]  Of course I'm not a communist.  What are we, communists?  Keep going.  D.C. Snyder.  Watch out for D.  D.  Going to town on the shelves, knocking everything off.  The owl from that movie.  The mechanical owl from that movie.  Oh, right.  Clash of the Titans.  Yeah, I think you're right.  I think it was Clash of the Titans.  And who's the chick in the background in the blurry?  She wasn't good enough to be in focus.  No. 
[01:17:30]  Teen Wolf.  Teen Wolf.  Teen Wolf.  But not like Michael J. Fox.  No, he's not shaking.  You could tell.  Who's the guy in the back?  Right here?  Yeah.  There?  Those are the people I'm trying to figure out.  Yeah, who's that guy?  You know how mad they must be?  They have film, but that's what I mean.  Chucky.  Little Chucky.  The ones in the background that are not in focus that have to be people, too.  Al from the 80s.  Yeah.  So I just water.  Slaughter.  Here's the guy again.  Yeah, who is that guy?  He's in gold pants, a black shirt.  He's got kind of an afro. 
[01:18:00]  Can't tell.  The Hulkster, though.  Look at him.  Again, Mary LeRenton.  Now they're running out of the store.  In a DeLorean.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  A reference there.  Teen Wolf goes into a DeLorean.  That's fucked up.  Oh, that is pretty fucked up.  Damn.  I'm about to take off.  It's time for a new Radio Shack.  What does that mean?  Are they going to finally build a real store?  They're finally going to have what I want. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, they're trying to.  I've never gotten an item there that I needed.  Nothing.  It's just a bad store.  It was always a sad place.  Very sad.  It just was sad when you went in there.  Radio Shack was sad.  Their stuff looked, because I don't feel like getting sued, looked cheaply made.  Every single thing in there just looked cheaply made.  Yeah.  Back in the old, old days, though, Radio Shack was the place to go to buy capacitors, resistors,  transistors, and circuit boards, and schematics, and you'd solder together your own shit, you know? 
[01:19:00]  Not all of us.  That was kind of what it was there for.  Oh, not all of us?  No.  It was your thing.  Okay.  It's like, good for you, but...  That's a little geeky kid.  Yeah.  But then you'd go into Radio Shack, and you couldn't even find that stuff anymore.  You'd find cheap, knock-off versions of radio-controlled cars and shit like that.  It was horrible.  Are they doing the same bit?  Trying to figure out all the people from the Radio Shack commercial?  No.  I'm looking to see if anybody made a list, but I don't see one yet.  By the way, people are saying Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill was an album everyone had to have. 
[01:19:30]  Pearl Jam's Ten.  Who else?  Quiet Riot meant the Metal Health.  Everyone had to have that?  No.  I know I did.  There's some good songs on there, but I don't think everyone had to have it.  Slim Goodbody.  That was his name.  Who is that?  I don't remember Slim Goodbody.  He was on a Saturday morning educational show.  He would educate your body with that bodysuit thing. 
[01:20:00]  Okay.  It's just a solid gold dancer.  Oh, a solid gold dancer chick.  Oh, yeah.  No wonder that nobody showed him.  The ectoplasm.  We didn't see Slimer.  We didn't see Slimer.  Because he cut up a commercial at the end.  He comes through the wall and goes, yeah, you missed it.  Q-Bert?  I missed Q-Bert.  I didn't see Q-Bert.  I hate Q-Bert.  Q-Bert.  Q-Bert's a douche.  He really was.  I think the other guy must have been another solid gold dancer.  You think? 
[01:20:30]  I think so.  Oh, he had gold pants.  That's exactly what I'm basing that theory.  Solid gold.  Wow.  And Green Day's Dookie.  People don't have that.  Oh, yeah.  That was definitely an album.  Yeah.  Dookie, yes.  Yeah.  You ever heard of the album Dookie?  Oh, no.  You know all the songs.  It was the biggest album ever.  That's great.  I haven't heard of it.  Dookie.  That's not the biggest album ever.  It's not.  When I was in sixth grade, it was.  Exactly.  It was a horrible game.  Zaxxon.  It was huge.  It was Zaxxon.  I remember that.  Zaxxon.  They tried to be like, look, it's 3D. 
[01:21:00]  And they tried Zaxxoff after.  Zaxxon.  Zaxxon.  Zaxxon.  It was very difficult to play because it was supposed to be in 3D, but it wasn't.  And it cast a shadow and you could never get the altitude right.  It was horrible.  Remember how bad 3D graphics were in fucking like 1984?  They were really bad, yeah.  You were in the diner and you could smoke and it would be that black mark on the video game.  Right.  People were putting their cigarettes on the fucking game.  Yeah.  I would get shocked.  The Asteroids thing would shock me sometimes when I was playing. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  It would wear down.  The metal would be exposed.  I would get shocked all the time playing Asteroids.  Whoa.  And you wound up still transcending your shock pain and becoming the Asteroids champ.  I wasn't the champ.  What?  I just played well.  I was in the paper locally.  You remember the little molestable picture.  Super Bowl Sunday.  49ers Bengals.  Yeah.  That was when it was, 81.  So you missed the game because you were playing one big game of Asteroids?  Ten hours, yes. 
[01:22:00]  Ten hours.  And that was when Ozzy bit the head off the bat.  And that's why his picture's in the paper and I'm one picture over.  That's right.  But fast forward, Ozzy's thanking you.  That's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  You saw the tweet that Black Sabbath thanked me.  I was so happy.  That is crazy.  What was that on?  That was from their, they have a DVD release called Gathered in Their Masses.  And they're thanking Jimmy.  You fast forward.  Well, I'm on the DVD.  I'm interviewing them on their DVD.  That's so fucking cool.  Oh, man.  Extra.  You know how it is.  Guy just hangs out with his pals.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  That was pretty cool.  Did you play pinball?  Old school pinball? 
[01:22:30]  I never liked pinball.  I liked the old machines before they really fancied them up with all that shit where you  could get 10 million points and it doesn't mean anything.  And remember the, remember the, the, the knock when you got a free ball?  Free ball.  And you hear that.  You get that loud knock on wood telling you that you got a free ball.  You're like, yes.  That was always like, fuck.  That's, that was a great sound to hear.  Yeah.  Used to go to the miniature golf course on the corner of Elwood Road and Jericho Turnpike. 
[01:23:00]  I used to play that golf course.  Yeah.  It was like a little miniature golf course.  And then, uh, they, they had a whole big line of pinball machines go down there, pocket  full of quarters and ding, ding, ding, ding, just play pinball.  Too bad you didn't have Posey in your pocket.  Remember just, remember just having a heavy pocket full of quarters?  That was a good day.  Like I got my pocket full of quarters.  Playing some pinball.  We played at the bowling alley in Huntington.  Remember when Huntington had a bowling alley? 
[01:23:30]  Uh, not Larkfield Lanes.  No, right in town.  Now it's that supermarket.  Oh.  Yeah.  I went to Larkfield Lanes.  Right across from the movie theater basically.  Until I wrote in that bad check.  Dairy born.  Dairy born?  Dairy born.  Dairy born.  Dairy born.  What do you mean you wrote a bad check?  I, I, I said this once before.  The guy at Larkfield Lanes is really nice.  And, um.  Larkfield Lanes.  I mean, Larkfield Lanes.  That's a biggie.  We've all been to Larkfield Lanes. 
[01:24:00]  I think it's still there even.  And I, uh, I wrote, I wrote a $25 check.  And I was like, could you cash this please?  And he goes, yeah, okay, no problem.  I could tell he doesn't do this and stuff.  And he cashed it.  And I knew I didn't have any money in my account.  Ah.  What'd you buy with it?  Uh, I don't know.  Probably cigarettes and fucking.  Ice cream sandwiches.  Yodels.  Yeah.  Yodels.  Yodels and, uh, cigarettes.  I hate to have to make out with you.  Yodels and cigarette breath.  That's not what you said in the bathroom before. 
[01:24:30]  That's because you don't have Yodels on your dick.  And I had to avoid Larkfield Lanes for the longest time.  And sometimes I'd see him walking down Larkfield Road and I'd have to, like, I'd have to pull  a Louie Beans.  I'd have to run away.  You bummed him out, man.  Anthony Beans.  You just bummed that guy out.  I did bum him out.  I, I, he lost faith in.  You were a bummer.  He lost faith in the youth.  In the youth of America. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I used to, uh, I used to pass a few bad checks in my day.  Wow.  That's brave.  Passed it.  I wanted Macy's so I could get a girl a fucking present because I figured if I didn't get  her a present, she'd leave me, you know, desperate Anthony.  I don't even think it was any occasion.  I think it was just Anthony.  He has to get this girl.  He has to buy her something so she would like him.  What a dick bag.  What'd you get her?  Some stupid gold chain, of course.  Some fucking tinfoil gold chain that I wrote a bad check for. 
[01:25:30]  Did she leave you?  Of course she did.  How much was the, uh, bad check for?  I think it was for 200 bucks.  Wow.  Jesus.  I passed a bad check for 200 bucks.  I didn't have the balls to that.  I was too scared.  They didn't have a lot of the, uh, shit they have now where they could, you know, check  it on an instant, uh, if you have money in your account.  So they just kind of believed you.  As long as you had your ID and all that shit.  They just had to believe that you weren't passing a bad fucking check.  Remember how easy shoplifting used to be? 
[01:26:00]  Oh, what a fucking camera.  You can't get away with that shit now.  Cameras everywhere now.  Shoplifting was easy.  You just waited for the, the clerk to just be on, in another part of the store.  I never shoplifted.  I stole some candy and stuff from like this, the stationery.  But never like clothes.  I never went big.  And most of mine was stationery shit.  Baseball cards, candy.  Yeah, it's the only place I really stole from was the stationery.  And the famous Playboy magazine.  Man, if you got caught with the Playboy though, that was a double whammy.  You're stealing and you're a fucking pervert. 
[01:26:30]  I, I remember being in the stationery store, watching the mirrors, just waiting and waiting  for my opportunity.  And the guy finally, like, I was the only person in the store.  He got bored and went in the back quickly or, or tore in the back.  And I took the sprint for freedom with that Playboy, man.  Oh my God.  And I had, I had that for like years, that particular Playboy.  I used to do the move where, uh, I do the slow walkout and I would stop at the door and  be like, I was interested in something because I wanted him to think like, well, if he was 
[01:27:00]  stealing something, he wouldn't be running out of here.  Not sauntering to the doorway.  That takes balls.  It was a good strategy.  You gotta keep your cool.  You gotta keep your cool.  You can't crack under that pressure.  Oh, there would be no way I would be able to do that move.  Yeah.  No fucking way.  You had to pretty much know he didn't see you doing it.  Right.  You know?  So, but I always thought if I made it look too obvious, like I was walking out, I still  to this day do that move out of some type of guilt. 
[01:27:30]  When I go into someplace, realize very quickly they don't have what I need.  So I turn around and leave right away.  Then people say, come back, Anthony, it's your first meeting.  It's going to be okay.  They don't have what I need.  Very good.  I think we all have that guilt.  You turn around and just like, I would stop at the door again and be like, look at me.  I wouldn't be stopping if I stole from you.  Yeah.  I think we all have that guilt leaving stores.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  When you don't buy anything.  You have this weird thing in your head.  I don't know.  You almost feel guilty of something.  Like, fuck, will you relax?  There's nothing going on here.  Just leave the stupid store.  The stupid supermarket where you still got to walk through the fucking checkout thing to  get the fuck out.  And then you feel all like, ah, ah.  Ah, nothing for me today.  Yeah.  Stealing was so much fun, though.  It was more the thrill.  I might have been in the back office of a supermarket back in the day.  Oh, no.  Getting a talking to.  Getting a talking to.  Getting a talking to. 
[01:28:30]  What were you stealing from a supermarket?  I can't make shit up.  Meat like Boone and fucking.  I think it was like meat or something.  Yeah.  The basic shit.  I'm trying to remember.  Nothing for me today, thanks.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Boone and flounder.  But I didn't call anyone.  I just had a talking to.  He's shoving the meat in his thing.  He's like, we could get in trouble for this.  He goes, that's right.  That's right.  Yeah.  Good talking to in a back horrible office. 
[01:29:00]  Oh.  They put the light on you.  Asked to never return.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They didn't call the cops, though?  No, I swear.  Now they call the cops.  I think they now fucking do all that shit.  Call the fucking cops.  The cops show up.  Put the cuffs on the kids.  Try to scare them straight, you know?  Yeah.  Don't be stealing, kids.  Like I said, it's harder now with all the cameras.  Oh, my God.  There's no cameras.  Yeah.  You just had to be smart about it.  I don't even remember how I got caught, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  No.  That's one of those memories that, unfortunately, is fading away. 
[01:29:30]  There was also the move where you could still.  I remember the stationery store had a very high counter in it.  And if you did buy something, and this is a ballsy move,  because you had to look the guy right in the fucking eye while he's ringing it up.  And use your hands.  Just grab gum and shove it right in your pocket while you're looking at him.  Well, that was the move.  You'd sacrifice some of your money to get more.  Right, right.  You'd be talking to him.  He's ringing it up.  Right.  And you're just grabbing chiclets and shoving them in your pocket.  When you were sure there was no way he knew that you were grabbing stuff. 
[01:30:00]  He's not suspecting me.  Then you finally bought something.  Right.  So now you're like, hey, everyone's good here.  I bought something.  Hey, see?  Baseball cards.  Right.  See you later.  Oh, man.  Was that a treat, too, opening up a new pack of baseball cards?  Shitty gum.  Stupid shit.  I loved the shitty gum.  They never figured out the baseball card gum.  It had such a great flavor for .03 seconds.  Yeah.  I would just suck out the goodness.  Yeah.  It wasn't worth chewing.  It fell apart like Lot's wife. 
[01:30:30]  Very good.  It sucked when you bought the cards, though, and there were doubles in there or shit you  had already.  Right.  Yeah.  How much did you hate that when you got, like, two Ted Williams?  Oh, yeah.  It sucked.  Mahonis Wagner.  Yeah.  The, uh, and then I would flip baseball cards with people at school and lose all the time.  I was the worst flipper.  Fucking.  They'll flip you. 
[01:31:00]  What?  Colors.  Okay.  What did you flip?  What is it?  Colors.  There were colors.  So you'd flip for colors.  And there was arguments over the colors sometimes because there would be a couple colors it could  have been.  Yeah.  But it was always the red, green, fucking yellow.  It's your basic primaries and shit.  Uh, the blue.  But, uh, but then you flipped teams.  If you flipped teams, that went on forever.  It was a giant stack when someone finally won.  And I remember I'd be shaking.  What do you mean flip teams?  It was like my fucking elementary school version of blackjack. 
[01:31:30]  What do you mean flip teams, though?  You'd do the same thing as if someone flips and matches the color they would take it.  You'd have to wait until, like, here comes fucking Yankees.  Yankees.  Oh, we never did that.  And now you'd take the stack.  It would build up huge.  Right.  It was a huge jackpot right there.  I used to get sad because I liked my baseball cards.  I had no business flipping.  Flip you five.  Flip you five.  And it was five cards.  Right.  You have a little limit.  Right, right.  One, two, three, four, five.  Remember?  No, it would be like ding, ding, ding. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, no.  We would go one, two, three, four, five.  There would be five cards on the flip.  No, you'd just take five and you'd flip one at a time.  No.  But only five until you'd clean someone out.  And line them up.  No.  One at a time.  You'd go one down and then someone'd flip on top.  And then one down, flip on top.  We would line up our cards, too.  Like, here's my ten and then you'd go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  But we'd also do flip five where you would count five, you know, and then there would  be five cards going down.  I don't know.  Wow. 
[01:32:30]  I never did that.  That's crazy.  That's some Harbourfield shit right there.  That's stupid shit.  That's some Greenlawn shit.  You motherfuckers are always fucking shit up.  Elwood.  Elwood, nigga.  Now what the hell are they going to do?  Hey, what are you going to flip for iPads for Pete's sake?  I can't do that no more.  Those were the days.  Oh, man.  What are you going to flip your flat screen, Sammy?  And then last, it's amazing how worthless last year's cards became.  Like, a year would go by, the new year baseball cards would come out, and last year's cards 
[01:33:00]  were just shit.  You used to chuck them up.  Yeah, I'm going to chuck up my cards.  And you'd grab a big stack and just throw them up in the air.  Sometimes kids would do that with the new cards, and it was like it would cause a frenzy.  In the hallway, just take cards and throw them, and people would be like, wah, like it  was money.  Crazy shit.  What a sad upbringing we had.  Aw.  Very suburban.  What the kids have today, and we were excited about baseball cards.  Baseball cards and fucking doom buggy wheelies. 
[01:33:30]  Stupid remote-controlled cars, doom buggies that had a cord attached to it.  Stupid as that.  Little battery pack.  You're walking it like a fucking mechanical dog.  It sucked.  Doom buggy wheelies.  Remember Digger the dog?  Digger, yes.  A dig in he goes with you when you explore.  Just pull his leash.  He's your dog for sure.  Digger the dog was a cunt.  Digger the dog. 
[01:34:00]  I got the nog version.  Digger the dog.  Digger the dog.  It just never ends.  With that, we're going to take a break, because we've got to get set for our POW interview.  Yes.  And I guess the guy's calling in, too, from 90 Day Fiance.  They're calling from, do you know where they are, right?  They're actually in Pittsburgh.  They live in Pittsburgh.  Wow.  Do they, Jim?  Yeah, well, they said that they should be there February 28th to come see my show. 
[01:34:30]  And if they said if you're in Atlantic City the 16th of February, I will be there one show only.  DC's all sold out, guys.  Oh.  Big shot me.  It is.  I'm looking at the one sheet for the Russ and POW interview, and on February 3rd, she retweeted this picture.  She decided to move on, and she's happy now?  What's that about?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  Her Twitter's weird, because it, I mean, it does not look like she's in the country. 
[01:35:00]  On her Twitter.  And Russ and POW are calling from separate phones.  Oh.  I guess things didn't work out.  I don't know.  I'm sure they won't fess up to it.  Yeah, because they want people watching the show.  Yeah, they'd be like, oh, you've got to watch the show, all right?  All right, well, we're going to talk to them within the half hour.  Are we going to try to get Lady Di on the phone?  Because she's trying to back out of Super Show 2.  We're working on it.  She should fucking back out of it with a fucking bullet sandwich. 
[01:35:30]  Shotgun palate cleanser.  And she wants to take Marion with her.  What the fuck's that about?  And she's rescheduling her own thing.  She's like, no, we're not going to come in.  We're going to come in in March.  Oh.  Come on.  You don't tell us.  Yeah, we're not going to do this in March.  Exactly.  There's no room to march in here.  Oh, gee.  The whole thing was supposed to be for Marion's birthday.  Right.  So she better call the show today.  How old is Marion?  50. 
[01:36:00]  How old is it in pig years?  Opi and Anthony have been creating radio gold for 20 years.  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history, here's our 20th anniversary Opi and Anthony radio gem.  What's the cinnamon challenge?  You've got to give it to him if he really needs it.  We can't have this idiot.  Take a teaspoon.  It's supposed to be a tablespoon.  Just give him a teaspoon.  Let's see what this does.  We're not going to use the little sprinkle. 
[01:36:30]  That will take nine days to get it on the fucking table.  Nine days.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Go.  Okay.  Fuck it off.  E-Rock is attempting...  You all right, E-Rock?  Smoke is coming out of him.  He's smoking.  What is it?  You all right, E-Rock?  How is it?  He's like that old wrestler.  Water, you asshole.  Holy shit.  A whole cloud came out. 
[01:37:00]  Drink a little water.  Inhale.  Breathe slow.  Water, water, water, water.  Breathe slow.  Through your nose, fuckface.  You all right?  It's too loud.  Jesus.  Breathe water.  Drink water.  This is the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  He's going to drink water.  Drink water.  Drink water.  Drink a little water.  Something just came out of his forehead.  You okay?  Water just came out of his forehead.  E-Rock. 
[01:37:30]  Water.  It smells so nice in here, though.  It smells like cinnamon toast.  It smells like Christmas.  There's a cloud of cinnamon that went across the road.  E-Rock.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up!  Holy shit!  E-Rock, we just want to make sure you're okay.  You can't breathe.  He's breathing all right.  He's just...  Just slowly.  Very slowly.  You gotta do it.  Slowly.  It's like mustard gas. 
[01:38:00]  Take a little bit of water.  Just a little in your mouth.  Oh, it's coming out of his nose.  A little in your mouth.  No sip.  No sip.  Someone get him a napkin.  Are you puking?  We'll just gargle and spit the water out of him.  Yeah, gargle and spit the water out.  Very slow breaths.  You have to breathe like you're giving birth.  Like that.  Holy shit.  Dude, that was fucking bad.  All right. 
[01:38:30]  Just breathe.  Wow, man.  What the fuck is that stuff?  I never heard of that.  What does that do?  I can't.  Do you want to do it again?  What's the matter?  I'll let him...  Shut up.  I'm nasty, man.  That is bad.  You all right, Iraq?  What a weird reaction that is.  I would never have fucked up.  See, even the water.  You can't drink water because the cinnamon keeps going down. 
[01:39:00]  But you know what?  This is the weird thing.  Is that this cures cancer if you do this once.  Shut up.  No, seriously.  You'll be immune to cancer.  Shut up.  Well, once again, it doesn't work.  You can't do that.  You can't eat cinnamon.  Wait, you know what?  Before we decided...  Did he really try it out?  Shut the fuck up.  Yes, he did.  Opie and Anthony are back.  On with the fart jokes.  On the series XM.  That cinnamon challenge thing. 
[01:39:30]  Fuck.  That was a scary day.  For real.  That's just brutal.  Absolutely.  Hacking his lungs out.  I'm enjoying the look backs.  Yeah.  Always a little fun.  For 20 years with Anthony and 12 with Jimmy.  How many with Jimmy?  Eight.  14.  Really?  14?  Yeah.  About 2000.  Around 2000.  Fuck.  14 years with Jimmy. 
[01:40:00]  Holy fuck.  No.  That's a long fucking time.  A little dookie for everybody.  Green Day.  Right?  I can't listen to these guys because they had some impression.  Very nasal.  You really fucked it up for everybody.  Yeah.  I tend to do that.  Yeah.  I see line nine, Travis.  Let's do it.  Nine, nine, nine.  Okay.  By the way, Russ and Pal from 90 Day Fiance will be on our phones in mere minutes. 
[01:40:30]  Lady Di, what's up?  Hi.  How's everything?  We're not going to be in the studio tomorrow.  Okay?  I just want to let you know.  And I'm sorry that we disappointed you, but we're not going to be there tomorrow.  Well, I hope everybody enjoyed Lady Di.  Yeah.  She'll never be on our show again.  While she was on the show. 
[01:41:00]  Make sure you tweet her and tell her she'll never be on our show again.  That's it.  I'd appreciate that.  Done.  From the knuckleheads.  That's it.  Got a job for the knuckleheads.  Tell Lady Di she's done.  She doesn't decide.  She will never.  Yeah.  Especially because of her reasoning.  She thinks the weather's going to be bad tomorrow.  Colin took off to be on the show with her.  Right.  Oh, boy.  She's not going to be here.  The weather.  Didn't she know she could just look at the weather?  It's not going to be bad. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  They said it was going to be bad days ago.  And then they figure out, no, it's not going to be bad.  But she's probably still like, oh, I hear it's going to be a blizzard.  Right.  But she's so fucking stupid.  I hear the storm we're supposed to get Sunday's not really going to happen.  Oh, a dusting.  We're going to get maybe an inch or two.  Now they're saying it's Nova Scotia.  Yeah.  That's going to get hammered.  Old Nova Scotia.  But they probably knew that the whole time.  Right?  Yeah.  But they didn't let us know until it was obvious to everybody. 
[01:42:00]  Old Nova Scotia.  What do you say when the waiter asks you if you'd like some Viscotia?  Nova Scotia.  That's great.  I woke up at one in the morning last night.  I went to bed at like 12, 1230.  So you slept an hour?  Not even.  And I could not get back to sleep.  And you guys got to leave for Washington today.  Yeah.  For some sold out shows.  Wow.  Very good.  They're going to sleep in the car? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you do that with Kenny?  I'm debating the train, actually.  Oh, really?  Why?  Faster.  I want to get to bed.  If I can get in nice and early, I could get a couple hours.  Gotcha.  I thought she would call back, Sam.  We hung up on her when she said she's not going to be here.  And she hasn't called back yet.  Should we try to get her back on?  You want to?  Yeah.  I thought it would be a quick, you know, what happened.  Expand on wine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's Viscotia?  Of Viscotia? 
[01:43:00]  Viscotias are really good.  No.  It's a combination of, it's a knish with a celery stalk, peanut buttered on top of it  like a tree.  Oh.  A Viscotia.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, then I understand why people would say, no Viscotia.  Well, you can't.  You've eaten too many Viscotias.  People usually snack on them.  It sounds awful.  It's delicious.  All right.  She's calling back.  Ah.  Oh, good.  Lady Di, what happened?  Ah, nothing.  The phone's cut out on your end. 
[01:43:30]  Ah, okay.  So what were you saying?  Ah, no, we're not going to be at the show tomorrow.  Mary's not feeling good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, but the whole thing is, next week is her birthday.  Okay?  So this was supposed to be Marion's birthday party, right?  This fucking moron.  Yeah.  It was supposed to be Marion's birthday.  Go ahead.  And, you know, I don't think it would be right for me to go on the show without her.  What?  You did it last time.  Yeah.  No, no, no. 
[01:44:00]  That was fine.  So we won't celebrate her birthday then?  Right.  It's not a birthday then.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Well, you know.  She was coming in for her birthday as a little thing, but if she can't make it, we still have  a show to do.  Yeah.  Why don't you come in tomorrow?  We weren't revolving.  The show wasn't about Marion's birthday.  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I have to discuss it with her.  Why can't you come in tomorrow?  Yeah.  Without anything having to do with Marion, why can't you show up tomorrow? 
[01:44:30]  Go.  You know, I knew you guys were going to say that.  All right?  It would not be right for me to go up there by myself when it's being close to her birthday.  Why?  It's not her birthday show.  It has no sense.  It has nothing to do with her birthday.  We would probably, we would barely mention it.  All right.  We'll have to see what happens. 
[01:45:00]  See?  No, no, no.  We'll have to plan ahead.  Right.  We can't just see what's going to happen.  We will be so disappointed that we absolutely will not have you on the show anytime soon  if you don't show up tomorrow.  Di, there is a major celebrity who's a friend of the show that's coming in tomorrow specifically  to meet you.  Yeah.  Okay.  And that's true.  Who?  I can't say who it is.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Marion said we're going to be up there sometime in March.  No, it's tomorrow he's coming. 
[01:45:30]  No, you're, yeah, you're coming tomorrow or you're not going to be on this show anytime  soon.  Period.  Because we have a sponsor and everything.  Oh, boy.  I mean, I mean, right now, what you're, what you're doing is, um, I'm between you guys and  my best friend.  You can come on.  That's a huge distance between us.  That's a pig in a hard place.  I think we're closer to the sun. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You can come on and wish her a happy, you can sing a happy birthday to her on the air.  Yeah, maybe we'll, maybe we'll, uh, give her a phone call or something.  Okay.  All right.  Um.  Why won't you, what, you have to come in.  That's all there is to it.  We've planned things.  You're coming in in March though, right?  Jimmy.  Well, yeah, it's March.  No, no.  No, you, you will not be here in March. 
[01:46:30]  I can guarantee that.  Okay.  Well, then she'll be there in March.  No, she will not be either.  We're going to take you both out.  Take us out where?  Fucking home run die.  I'm only kidding.  Can I call you back?  Why?  You're going to work it out with Marion, right?  Yeah, I'm going to try to.  You're training bed bugs to do tricks?  Yeah.  How are the bed bug bites? 
[01:47:00]  Uh, there was no bed bugs anymore in this place.  Well, that's good to hear.  Don't worry about it.  There isn't any.  Believe me.  She'll track them out of the studio.  Trust me.  And how many, uh, Natty Ices have you had so far?  How many?  Uh, all right.  All right.  This is my third one.  Uh-huh.  When I was talking to you last night.  It's 840 in the morning.  When I was talking to you last night on Twitter, how many had you had at that point?  Oh, I don't know.  After a while, I don't count them, Sam.  Uh-huh. 
[01:47:30]  Are we thinking like, are we thinking like five or are we thinking like 15?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Somewhere around there.  Somewhere around where?  15, you said?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty close.  Pretty close.  Pretty close.  Jesus.  I don't know how many I had.  That's just.  I don't know.  All right.  You call up Marion, and you've got to call us back before the end of today's show.  Okay, I will.  And if the answer is you're not coming, then I don't know what to tell you. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  And that's bad news for you and Marion if you don't come.  She's going to have to suffer those consequences as well.  If we can't depend on you guys, we're not going to plan on having you in.  Yeah, we're going to take both of you out because we have a sponsor.  Yeah.  You can't tell me who the sponsor is.  The sponsor is Steven Singer.  Who?  Steven Singer.  Steven Singer.  Did you listen to our show?  He's a jeweler.  He's our only sponsor, basically.  He wants you here in March.  He said he'd come in March. 
[01:48:30]  We got him and a razor guy.  That's about all we have for our advertising here.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'll try to give her a call, but I'll explain to her the whole situation, and we'll  see what happens.  All right.  The situation is this.  We weren't throwing Marion a dumb birthday party.  Right.  We probably would have said, oh, that's right.  It's your birthday, son.  Happy birthday.  But it's just the super show.  Right.  Why are you calling the super show?  Because we're inviting everybody.  Oh, my God. 
[01:49:00]  Inviting everybody like who?  Like you.  Do you remember the last time we did this a mere few weeks ago?  Yeah, you were here.  You were here.  All right.  We're doing that again, kind of, with different things.  Is Sammy and Patty going to be there, too?  Yes.  Yes.  In March.  No, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  In March.  Well, Colin's probably going to be there, right?  He will be there.  Yes.  Yes.  He will be here.  He flew to Colorado today for a gig.  He will be there.  Yeah, he's flying back just to do the show, and then he's going to go back to Colorado. 
[01:49:30]  Well, the thing is, though, Marion...  Tell Marion...  It's her birthday party tomorrow.  Listen to me.  Tell Marion this is what's happening.  Colin flew to Colorado today.  He's doing shows tonight in Colorado.  Then he's going to fly all the way back to New York to do our radio show tomorrow morning,  because you and Marion are going to be there.  And then he's going to fly all the way back to Colorado to continue his gigs.  Can I go with him? 
[01:50:00]  Colorado.  Yeah.  We'll book a C-130.  Throw you out the back with a big parachute.  Operation.  Yeah.  You seriously want to go to Colorado?  Well, yeah.  Well, I would like to.  One day.  It's a dream.  It's a dream.  Going to Colorado?  Rancho going to Florida.  One day?  Hold on a second.  Isn't it snowing in Colorado?  Well, what do you think?  Not really.  Not usually in February.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  I don't think they get a lot of snow.  It's snowing in fucking Honolulu this year.  That's right.  All right.  Well, let me call her up and explain the situation to her.  There's no situation.  Big birthday party.  What are you going to explain to her?  Lady Dot.  And what kind of sickness does she have?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  She just had like a stomach virus or something.  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine her on the toilet.  Honey, I need more toilet paper.  Oh, God.  I'm wiping my ass.  It's still fucked up.  She's on a cordless phone like Gordon Gekko used to use. 
[01:51:00]  Just clogging the pipes.  Die.  Die.  Die.  I've got to take you to tomorrow.  What?  Die.  What are you going to, you say you're going to explain the situation to Marion.  What are you going to explain to her?  Coming in in March.  Right.  Yeah.  Work it out with us.  Make believe we're Marion.  How would you explain this?  All right.  All right.  This is what I'm going to say.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people are coming in tomorrow and they will be very, they will be very disappointed 
[01:51:30]  if at least I don't show up.  Right.  Right.  Wait.  You've got to say hello.  You're pretending that the show is Marion.  So say, hi, Marion.  What are you doing?  Well, she's, actually, by now she's working.  We're role-  No, no, no.  Listen.  Dumbest person ever.  We're role-playing.  Yeah, right, Pat.  You can't.  We're role-playing.  You're pretending that we're Marion.  So I'm saying, pretend that we're Marion.  Say, hey, Marion, what are you doing?  Hey, Marion, what are you doing?  Oh, just rooting around in my own shit in a pen. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, you stop it, Jimmy.  Come on, Paul.  Come on, Rudy.  My owner's got me out looking for truffles.  We got Leon on the phone.  He hasn't called in a while.  Hey, Lee.  Leon.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I was wondering if I can come to that party you got tomorrow.  The super show.  Yeah, you sure can, Leon.  I would love to come down there.  And why are you guys always ragging on that dude on the phone there? 
[01:52:30]  You fucking dopey bitch.  It's me.  Is it snowing in Colorado?  What do you think, you dopey fucking man?  You are the stupidest fucking man around, okay?  Colin doesn't want anything to do with you.  He's not bisexual.  Okay.  Very good.  He doesn't want anything to do with me, all right?  Whatever.  What did I tell you? 
[01:53:00]  Then why do you want to go to Colin?  You're breaking her heart.  Oh, yeah.  I was just joking when I said that.  No, you want to suck his dick.  You're not a comic.  You're a stupid man.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever.  You're going to put your fucking mouth and fucking keep your dick in your pants and leave  my friend Colin alone.  Okay.  Okay.  I will.  Okay.  There he goes.  Bullied very easily.  Thank you, Leon.  Leon doesn't speak for all of us, Lady Di.  Yeah, Lady Di, you got to come in. 
[01:53:30]  It's unfortunate Marion can't come in.  We'll reschedule where Marion can also come in, maybe in March, but you have to be here  tomorrow.  You have to be here.  We have sponsors and everything.  And maybe Marion will start feeling better when she realizes that if she doesn't come  in, she'll never be on the show again.  I'll see what I can do.  All right.  Call us back.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stupid.  That was classic. 
[01:54:00]  Hey, all right.  Now, we're Marion.  Ask, what are you doing?  Hey, Marion, what's up?  No, she's at work.  She's just, she's frighteningly stupid.  Oh, is she a dummy?  Yes, she is.  Just an adult.  We got Tom Sizemore.  What?  I didn't, did you think Tom Sizemore was sober when he came in here, Jimmy?  I didn't know that day.  You never know.  I was trying to get people.  I would say no.  I just don't know.  I would say.  I think he's still having a very, very tough time with his addiction. 
[01:54:30]  But I guess he was telling everyone that Elizabeth Hurley slept with Bill Clinton.  He dated her, I think.  He dated her?  I think he had a three-year fling with her.  His book was very good.  Oh, you're talking about Tom Sizemore.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But Tom Sizemore said that President Clinton.  Yeah, he said he set it up.  But he set it up.  Tom Sizemore said he set it up and that, yeah, and Bill Clinton had a sex romp with Elizabeth Hurley.  It was tapes that came out of Tom Sizemore telling a group of friends this story. 
[01:55:00]  Who taped them?  One of his friends, his, you know, quote-unquote friends while he was doing drugs.  Oh, really?  And he said it was done before 2010, but then Radar is saying it was done in January.  Oh, wow.  Like this year.  That's what Radar Online, I think, was saying.  Well, now Sizemore is saying this today.  Tom, first of all, this is a pretty incredible story filled with pretty incredible details in the telling of it.  Is it true? 
[01:55:30]  No, it's not true.  I was never at the White House and I never met Bill Clinton.  Have you ever been to the White House at all?  I went to a...  He just said he was never at the White House.  Anyone else hear that?  Of course.  But have you ever went to the White House at all?  Do you know Bill Clinton?  Well, it looks like some people got to Tom Sizemore.  Oh, man.  Knock it off.  I was never there.  You idiot.  Ever been to the White House at all?  I went to a screening of Black Hawk Down, but it wasn't in the White House.  There was a theater near the White House.  But I've never been to the White House to meet a chief or president, any president. 
[01:56:00]  Wow.  He's nervous.  Where does this story come from?  Well, I'm not denying that I said these things.  I don't remember saying them, but it's an old videotape.  And they're the rantings of a guy that has been well chronicled that had a very severe drug problem.  Although I said none of it is true. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  When was this audio recorded?  It's an old tape.  I'm not sure.  I didn't willingly...  I wasn't willingly videotaped.  But those were the kind of folks I was hanging around with back before I went to celebrity rehab.  Cool, fun people.  Started straightening out my life.  On the death show?  Before he went on the death show.  He was on the celebrity death show.  Yeah.  That's when he turned his life around.  Right.  Can we see that tape?  It's only audio, and it's kind of long and rambling. 
[01:57:00]  I am.  I'd like to hear a little of it.  Maybe hear a little Tom Sizemore all fucked up.  Does it sound fucked up?  A little.  Maybe we could get clips of that.  Get one of our guys behind the scenes to grab a few clips of that.  What do you think?  Do a little clip grabbing.  Yeah.  Yeah, grab some of them clips.  Yeah.  By the way, people are pointing out that Marion's sick, but she's at work today.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, right.  Uh-huh.  Exactly. 
[01:57:30]  Uh-huh.  If she's...  Ugh.  Just...  Lady Di is Lady Lye.  She is one of the biggest fucking bullshit artists.  She's constantly fibbing.  She loves telling fibs.  Out of school?  Out of school.  Stories out of school.  Out of school?  She tells tall tales.  Yes.  A tall, fat tale.  And she has a small, squiggly one. 
[01:58:00]  She's a pig.  Who ran with that fucking Liz Hurley story, though, like it was real?  Radar.  Why would they do that?  It's believable.  Why wouldn't they say, this guy is fucked up on this tape, but here's what he said.  Right.  Instead of, did they report it like Bill Clinton?  They said, Tom Sizemore says...  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Hurley's...  Hurley's ex-lover caught on bombshell audio recording revealing ex-prez's White House sex romps behind wife Hillary's back. 
[01:58:30]  See, that isn't ramblings of an addict say that Bill Clinton fucked Liz Hurley.  Well, they adjust the headline a little bit.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  A little bit, huh?  I would like to adjust the headline.  Oh.  Comedian says that Liz Hurley had sex with Bill Clinton, and if she wants to disprove it, she must sit on comedian's face.  Oh.  And grind a little.  That will straighten everybody out. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  All right.  Do we have the video of the pink goo?  Yes.  Well, no, not the pink goo.  The real way McDonald's chicken nuggets are made, you mean.  Oh, what?  That other video is the fake way?  Yeah.  McDonald's Canada put out a video that shows how chicken nuggets are made.  Right.  For real.  Yeah.  So, the video with the pink goo that most of us have seen.  Well, we've seen that photo, and that kind of, yeah, they say that.  That's all bullshit. 
[01:59:30]  That's all bullshit.  Malarkey.  Okay.  Malarkey is the term I was looking for.  All right.  Let's see how chicken McNuggets are made.  Turn the screen.  Hot.  Hot screen.  Who is this, bitch?  Why would you call her a bitch?  I don't know.  She has a big, giant moon face.  Oh, she's horrible.  She looks like she should be holding a Star Wars blaster.  Sports fan?  Yeah, maybe.  Did he make the cut?  He's still here.  Oh, nice.  I like him.  They had more cuts recently.  He's a good guy. 
[02:00:00]  Budget cuts.  That's serious.  I feel bad for the dudes that lost their jobs.  Seems like they have enough money around here.  And who are we to judge if he wants to fucking bang that Star Wars girl?  Who cares?  If you want to stick your dick in a three, knock yourself out.  Knock yourself out.  I'm going to fuck a keyhole.  If you want to ruin your life over a three.  Things I'd rather fuck than her.  There's a long list.  Snapping turtle mouth.  Hubcap.  Fucking hubcap.  Kenyan mall window during the shooting. 
[02:00:30]  All right, you want to see the McDonald's deal?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, of course.  Hi, I'm Nicoletta.  I'm the supply chain manager for McDonald's Restaurants of Canada.  And I'm here today at Cargill in London, Ontario, to answer a question we received from Armaud from Edmonton, Alberta.  That car you breathe underwater.  He asks, what are legitimately in McNuggets?  Is there pink goop?  Armaud, I'm guessing this is the image that you're referring to.  Oh, that looks delicious.  It's an image that often gets associated with McDonald's.  And it's a question that we get a lot. 
[02:01:00]  We don't know what it is or where it came from.  But it has nothing to do with our Chicken McNuggets.  Wow.  But I want you to see for yourself.  Fuck McDonald's.  We're going out a lot of water.  To see how our Chicken McNuggets are made.  Yes.  What?  They stress how they're shitting into a bag.  We have my check.  She's got a development scientist for Cargill, Canada.  And she's going to walk us through the process.  That's right.  The process.  The process.  They're walking through big doors.  Oh, my God.  We separate all of the chicken cuts.  And set aside the chicken breast meat from Chicken McNuggets.  Chicken breast meat.  On this part of the line, the chicken breast that's been separated. 
[02:01:30]  Chicken tits.  And the chicken breast that we use in the Chicken McNuggets.  So next to the bin, the chicken breast meat is pushed to the blending room.  And we're lifting it up and dumping it into the grinder.  And adding the ground chicken breast meat to the blender with some seasonings and some chicken skin.  And then we'll take the mixed chicken meat out of the blender.  So we can see here, here's what it is.  Refer back to the image for Armand.  And here's the thing, good image. 
[02:02:00]  It doesn't look much better.  Well, they're saying, Tim, Paul, you're saying before I kick you off enough, they're saying that this is just chicken breast and some chicken skin in the blender.  Well, they said other ingredients, too.  Spices for seasoning.  Yeah.  There was no ambiguity there for, like, chicken gizzards or anything.  Was there a beef?  No, they said breast meat and chicken skin.  But chicken skin makes it incredibly unhealthy.  Yeah.  Chicken skin.  But it's tasty.  They're not saying it.  Do people understand chicken skin is one of the worst things you can eat? 
[02:02:30]  Exactly.  Just because they see it on a chicken.  Well, chicken's good for you.  It seems to be dangerous.  I have a hat made of chicken skin.  Oh, jeez.  It's a delicious hat, but very unsafe.  It's a ski mask.  My face always smells like chicken gizzards.  Jesus.  I just point at the TV and laugh.  Actually, not for everybody.  For three people.  Yeah.  That looks horrendous, though.  Well, it looks like chicken salad or something without... 
[02:03:00]  It looks like tuna fish.  Yeah, like some kind of white fish.  Yeah.  Right, Jimmy.  But it's all right.  We understand what's in there, and there's no real shenanigans going on.  So let's see where it continues at this point.  Sure.  Someone eats it and shits it out.  It's nuggets.  As well as seasoning and a natural portion of skids for flavor and as a binder.  But they're not chicken nuggets just yet, so we're going to see how the rest of the process is made right now.  Process.  In the forming room, the blended chicken meat will be portioned into the four chicken McNugget shapes.  Oh, look at that. 
[02:03:30]  The boot and the bow tie.  And then the chicken McNugget shapes be covered with a light batter and covered by a second thicker batter called tempura.  So we just part-fried the nuggets.  We're going to take one off the mill.  When I break it in half, you can see it's raw inside.  And it's the same blended meat that we took out of the blender and sent it to the portioner.  So we just part-fried it so we can set that batter on it, but the nuggets will be fully cooked in the restaurants. 
[02:04:00]  That's right.  So after the McNuggets are part-fried, they're frozen.  And it's very loud in the packaging room, but we're going to see them bagged, lost, and prepared for shipping.  Well, we've looked at the end of the process.  Thanks for the tour, Jess.  Bosses!  And Vermont, thanks for the question.  We've hopefully answered it.  Damn.  You know what, though?  That's a very smart thing by McDonald's, and that's what companies should do.  That'll go everywhere, too.  Yeah.  Say, hey, look, see?  That'll go everywhere.  I'm going to get some McNuggets today.  With my honey. 
[02:04:30]  They're still horrible for you.  It seems to be, you know, fucking chicken meat, pressed meat, and some skins.  We have some seasoning.  A little batter.  A little crispy batter.  A little batter called the tempore.  Oh, that sounds like a small guy's up at the plate.  Oh, a little batter.  We've got very good news.  Oh, good.  Oh, what do we got?  We've got a celebrity on the line and some dude.  Yo, pow!  Hello, dear.  Pow?  Oh, hey, I'm here.  Hi, pow.  How are you? 
[02:05:00]  We're big fans.  You know we're big fans.  Huh?  Oh, I like that.  Oh, yeah.  You're kind of me on the show.  Both.  Oh, we're fans of the show and, of course, fans of you.  Yes.  Of course, let me tell you, you're quite beautiful.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes.  We're all in with this 90-day fiancé show.  Yeah, it's a great show.  Russ is on the other line.  We'll get to him eventually.  We'll get to him eventually. 
[02:05:30]  Leave it there.  Leave it there.  I'm kidding.  So where are you calling us from?  I'm from Tulsa.  Right now I'm in Tulsa.  I'm in Tulsa.  Tulsa.  Oh, you are in Oklahoma.  Oh, my God.  It's so freaking cold.  Oh, no.  No, no.  That is rotten.  Wait, if you're calling for Oklahoma, that means you married the dude.  Uh-oh.  No, I'm not.  Uh-huh.  And I need to, it's still running, you know. 
[02:06:00]  The time is running.  Oh, the time's still running.  The time's still running.  It's not running.  What, do you think you're dealing with amateurs?  That was filmed a while ago.  Wait, what time is it where you are?  Yeah.  It's 8 a.m.  Oh, okay.  8 a.m.  Yeah.  I am, all right.  And I got to tell you, my favorite part of the whole show, the jacuzzi, the hot tub.  Well, I've been receiving many messages about that. 
[02:06:30]  That, oh, my God.  That bikini.  When you came out in that bikini and then you take your towel off and you're just standing  there in front of one of the most disinterested men in the world, it was fantastic.  Fantastic.  When someone cares more about his cowboy hat than that luscious body of yours, I must  say, I was a little taken aback.  Right.  It was, let's just say, mysterious.  Right.  Well, that hat, I didn't like it. 
[02:07:00]  No, I didn't either.  No.  It looked good on you, though.  It did look good on you, pal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pal, are those boobies real?  Oh, my goodness.  Opie.  Yeah, they're real.  If you can see it, yeah, they're real.  We've discussed them at length, and we do believe that those are real boobs.  Like, I don't think they're implants.  Yeah, they're real, and they're mine.  Oh, all right.  How was it living with Russ's parents?  Oh, that was really, I don't know, crazy.  They are really nice people. 
[02:07:30]  They seem very nice.  Yeah, they're really nice.  It's just that I don't have the idea that I have to sleep in separate rooms.  It's kind of crazy.  Yes.  You know what?  You have to get to know Russ very well before you marry him, and it was kind of keeping you  guys from knowing each other in more of a biblical sense.  And I do believe he found you a bit icky at times, which is crazy to us, because, I mean,  you're sneaking into his room, and he's like, oh, God, no, you can't be in here.  Right. 
[02:08:00]  My parents' room is right downstairs.  Go back to that other room.  Yuck.  That's crazy.  That was awful.  That was really awful.  That is awful.  And I don't know many men that would chase a girl that's wearing lingerie out of the room.  Right.  I know a few.  I know a few, but not many that would do that.  There seems to be a mystery there that why would anyone do that?  Right, right.  I would say fuck religion at that point.  Oh, jeez.  You can't be that into God if you see it. 
[02:08:30]  It's awful.  It's awful.  You haven't seen him in a long end.  What do you want to do?  Just catch that with little things.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, he was probably going to make some whoopie or something.  Very good.  Very good.  My favorite scene is when you walk downstairs and just lie.  Getting breakfast together.  Oh, Andrew, it was just something comfortable, you know?  Oh, exactly.  Very comfortable.  You know, let me tell you what I would have done at that point. 
[02:09:00]  I would have invited you to have breakfast on my lap.  Just sit on my lap and let the parents watch as I feed you.  I feed you breakfast.  Yeah, that would be awesome.  Yes, two eggs over easy and a fat Italian sausage.  Right.  Right.  I would have kicked Russ and his parents out of the house.  Exactly.  I would have said, beat it, stupids.  Hey, he's on the line here.  I know, yes.  It is his parents.  I apologize.  They are his parents.  I apologize.  We've got to start from the beginning, though, with you, pal. 
[02:09:30]  What is this all about?  Did you really, what's the K-1 visa about?  Wait, what's this?  Well, we made the decision because Russ had to go back to the U.S.  and he proposed me and he said, well, you know what?  The only way that we can be together in here in the United States is that we can apply for the K-1 visa, the fiancée visa.  But that process, it takes like six to eight months to be approved and if you get approved. 
[02:10:00]  And, well, I got approved and I came to the United States and I only have 90 days to get married.  If I'm not, I have to go back to Colombia.  Oh, man.  Right.  It's a great concept for a show.  Yeah, it really is.  Yeah.  And how did the TV show come about?  I don't know.  Well, this is, they were, to be honest, I'm not so much about that subject because Russ was the person to talk with the TV show and everything. 
[02:10:30]  They explained if we want to be, if we want to share our story about how we made it and about the process, the 90 days to get married here.  So I said, well, I know.  It's nice to, we can, it will be nice that we can share how it's displayed from it.  That bikini was beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we ask Russ some questions?  I guess we'll ask Russ.  We've got to ask Russ some questions.  We'll put Russ on the phone with you.  Oh, hi, Russ.  Oh, here's the dude. 
[02:11:00]  Here I am.  Oh, boy.  Oh, hi, Russ.  Russ.  How are you, sir?  Oh, I don't know.  I've been, the ball's best is what it is.  Well, you've got to understand, Russ.  We're, you know, a few guys here.  Yeah, we're men, you know.  And we're looking at your fiancée on the show.  Pow.  And we really wanted to talk to her because she's very attractive and seems fun and everything like that.  How do you find Powell?  You like her a lot? 
[02:11:30]  You're in love, actually, with her?  Oh, she's like a dream come true fantasy, you know?  Oh, yeah?  Always had a little thing for Latino women.  Oh, you have?  To be that it's missing a part.  Oh, man.  Yeah, she's, uh, but she's very, very beautiful.  Do you worry that other guys might try to take her from you?  No, I trust her.  Oh, yeah?  You ever say to yourself, hey, something's missing here.  Or does the relationship seem full?  Right.  It's filled. 
[02:12:00]  Don't worry.  Yeah?  Do you think, like, your parents are real, like, religious, right?  Like, do you kind of wish that you didn't, like, listen to it?  Listen to it.  Me, like, the religion, like, do you kind of wish that you could have...  Yeah, you have to...  You have to...  Not listen to the religious stuff as much.  You have to play it your parents' way.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I mean, I respect my parents now.  Sure.  Do I have to follow their rules?  Not necessarily.  Not around...  Not when they're around.  I don't worry about it.  Right. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I get it.  Ah.  So, congratulations on the marriage.  That's awesome.  Oh, what?  What?  The show's over, and they got married, right?  Not yet, no.  He's not fessing to anything.  The show's still on.  Yeah, it's still on.  I've seen all the episodes.  Congratulations, Russ and Pow.  What, are we going to make believe we don't know they got married?  Oh, jeez.  What's up?  I don't know.  Keep watching.  I haven't seen them all.  No, I saw all the episodes, because we're big radio stars.  They gave us all the episodes. 
[02:13:00]  Show's still on.  We're lucky.  We'll see.  Maybe they watch someone different.  See?  They're like, shut up.  Oh, God, I love Pow and her personality.  She's wonderful.  Yes.  Hey, Russ, how did they approach you for this show?  Who approached you, and how did this show come about?  Right.  Well, as Pow said, we went through the K-1 visa, so I hired an attorney because there's  too much paperwork, and I didn't want to be dealing with all that.  Didn't want to make the mistake and then have her waiting again more than six to eight 
[02:13:30]  months.  So the production company contacted the attorney.  The attorney asked if I was interested, and talked to Pow about it, and said, let's go  for it.  We were wondering how they connected with people, I guess, through lawyers that do that  for a living.  Right.  Yes.  Okay.  Very cool.  Have you met any of the other couples?  I have not.  We have not.  How do you feel about the show, portraying you two?  Well, honestly, I think they're missing the point. 
[02:14:00]  They're missing our story behind it.  Yeah, I think they're missing the point, too.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  There seems to be more going on here.  You think they're using editing and stuff to maybe change things around?  That's what I'm getting at.  Well, you guys, you're in the network.  You're in the, you know how business goes, so.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What are you mad about as far as, you know, what they've shown on TV?  Yeah.  What did they make look a lot worse than it was? 
[02:14:30]  Like, I don't know how honest I can be.  You can be honest.  It's fine.  You can be completely honest.  The show is becoming popular.  Yeah, man.  Everyone's watching.  Yeah.  Like, the living with the parent situation.  Yeah.  How that went down.  Right.  Because there was not, it's a little overdramatic on how that went down.  Oh, they made it kind of look like, well, was she staying in a separate room and whatnot? 
[02:15:00]  No, that was true.  Oh.  Pow.  There you go.  Pow, pow.  They didn't let me sleep with Ross in Ross's room.  They don't let me.  Why?  That was awful.  That was really awful.  Yeah.  It was.  But, well, we have to respect them.  But, you know what?  Well, now that we have our own apartment, that makes it better.  That makes everything better.  You know, you can catch up with the way you want it, and I can walk the way I want it around the apartment. 
[02:15:30]  Even if I want it, you know.  Yeah.  Without anything.  Show off that body of yours.  Oh, well.  Right?  Yeah.  Exactly.  I make it like, maybe.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And, pow, you travel the world, I see, on your Twitter.  Yeah, I've been traveling around the world.  I've been in different countries, and I like it.  This is the last place that I can.  I want to go to Vegas, to be honest with you, a long time ago. 
[02:16:00]  And my visa was denied.  So, I said, okay, let's go to another place.  I couldn't go there.  This is fine.  Yeah.  And I never expect to date with someone from here.  And I met Russ, and I have all these opportunities.  And it feels great.  You don't always get what you want, but you have mercy.  But if you try sometimes, I'd find you get what you need.  Hey, Russ, why'd you make her eat balls?  Oh, right.  Oh, disgusting. 
[02:16:30]  Russ?  Well, I don't know.  It was one of those, I saw the menu, and I thought, this will be interesting.  Oh, yum.  Oh, no.  Did you like it?  Did you like to eat balls?  I don't like to eat balls.  Well, not me.  Not me personally.  We absolutely don't like eating balls.  Not me personally.  No, you.  What, did Russ throw him up on the bridge of his nose?  Russ, comment.  Russ, what are you doing?  You all right?  I have no comment, but that's ridiculous. 
[02:17:00]  It is ridiculous.  It is ridiculous.  I understand.  Anthony gets a little itchy on the shelf.  I think the editing of the program and how they've done it did kind of paint a certain picture  that probably isn't as accurate as you would think.  Well, actually, that was my idea.  You know, there are some pretty nasty things in Columbia you can eat.  Sure.  You heard her talking about bacon.  Like vaginas, right, Russ?  I don't doubt it. 
[02:17:30]  Because Sosa said so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you into it?  I will have my revenge.  I will have my revenge with him to make him do something gross.  Right, right.  Like that.  Oh, you're planning some revenge?  Nice.  Oh, believe me.  I will.  I never had said I'm going to eat balls.  Come on.  Exactly.  If you want revenge, put your clit on him.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  On a plate. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, where are you guys going to live if you do get married, let's say?  Ah, very good question.  Because, Russ, it seems like she's not kind of into the whole cowboy thing.  Yeah.  Well, it all depends on where the job takes me in, you know?  Oh, yeah.  If the construction worker and Indian can move, too.  I think he works on oil rigs.  See?  We watched the show. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was the chaperone...  I'm sorry.  We're good.  No, I didn't catch your joke with that.  But all right.  Was the chaperone real, like your buddy had the chaperone, you guys?  No, that's the other couple.  Oh.  That's the other couple.  Who watched the show?  I do watch the show.  Jimmy's a little newer to the show than we are.  I do watch the show.  I can tell you everything about the show.  You guys went tailgating.  Powers on the electronic ball.  Oh, the mechanical ball is great.  The mechanical ball, I should say.  God damn.  She had to eat balls. 
[02:19:00]  She got the most expensive cowboy boots.  What do you want to know?  I know everything.  I saw that.  You were walking around Russell's house with lingerie on, and the mom was not happy about it.  We love the show.  Right.  Love it.  I'm glad that you like it, and I believe that it's going to get better.  And your storyline is fantastic.  We love watching that.  Yeah.  Very mysterious.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Do you think I'm crazy?  No.  No, you come off as a very fun... 
[02:19:30]  Very sexual.  You're very sexual.  You're loving life.  Yeah, yeah.  Very sexual.  It's just that I have curves, you know?  That's for the...  And I'm from Colombia.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure.  You got curves, all right.  No, we love that.  Like I said, when you drop that towel...  Wow, way.  ...by the jacuzzi.  Yep.  Now, what made me look like I didn't enjoy that?  Oh, wow.  And believe me, he did.  Oh, no, no.  I don't doubt it. 
[02:20:00]  It's just some of the camera shots.  I'm sure there's...  There might have been some bad editing, Ross.  We're sticking up for you.  The film on the cutting room...  That's what I'm saying.  They're making me look like I'm not enjoying every moment I've heard.  Uh-huh.  That's exactly it, you know?  Oh, we trust you.  Because on the cutting room floor, I'm sure, you know, your eyes are bugging out of your  head and whatnot.  Sure.  But more so on the show...  Right.  It kind of looked like you were more interested in your hat.  Right.  That's why we brought it up, Ross.  We're trying to help you out here.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You got to tell them, hey... 
[02:20:30]  You don't want to come across mysterious on a TV show?  No.  I think her.  That's what I'm taking.  Exactly.  I agree.  I believe it.  But both of those cameras are gone.  Watch out, right?  It's different.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're free to cruise.  Does she still get on you?  Does she still get on you about the smoking?  That's the other guy.  That's the other guy, Jimmy.  Jimmy is confused.  I'm newer to the show, but I love it. 
[02:21:00]  That's the other sap.  Ross doesn't like ciggies.  No.  No, that's the Cleveland dude.  Did you see the Cleveland guy?  The guy with the gut and ciggy breath, and his girlfriend never wants to kiss him because  he always reeks of fresh ciggies.  Ciggies.  Yeah.  We watched the show.  I love it.  I can tell.  I can tell.  You asked this.  What you do.  Ask me a question.  I'll prove I watched this damn show.  Go ahead.  I love it.  Either person.  Go ahead.  Are you going to get a question? 
[02:21:30]  I hope so.  All right.  No?  The Brazilian girl.  What's her name?  Pow, pow.  No, no.  She's Colombian.  Oh, that's Curelium.  Curelium.  Curelium.  Curelium.  Is she still a modeling?  I don't know.  We don't know anything about the other.  Yeah, we're not talking to that couple.  We like the whole show.  You can ask whatever you want with, like, Russ and I, but I don't know anything about the  other couples.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  You're just concentrating on your own storyline.  I want to know if you guys got married.  I really want to know.  I bet they did.  How many more episodes?  Me too.  Me too.  If you know, just let me know.  Oh, you don't even know.  I want to know if I get married.  Why would you guys be calling from different phones?  I find that a little strange.  Why are you calling our different phones?  That's my question.  Oh.  What?  So if I hang up on Russ, you'll be on Pow's phone in a second?  No, I think it's...  Oh, no, they're not married. 
[02:22:30]  Son of a bitch.  I had faith in you, too.  But she's here legally.  I'm out of his way.  Right next to me.  She's here legally.  Here legally, right next to you.  Right next to you.  There you go.  All right.  Don't say anything.  Don't say anything.  I'm illegal.  Where's the honeymoon?  Fire Island?  Key West?  Frisco?  Yeah, where was the honeymoon?  Oh, no.  We don't know where it's going to be if we get married.  Trying to trip her up. 
[02:23:00]  She's too smart for that, Opie.  Yeah, I see that.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're big fans.  Oh, huge fans.  Obviously.  Pow, we gave you a lot of Twitter followers.  A lot.  Yeah, thank you.  You're welcome.  It's PAO8705 on Twitter, right?  Yes, exactly.  And, Russ, what's your Twitter?  Rustynail624.  Oh, you don't seem happy, Russ.  You all right?  Hey, I'm happy.  Don't bash me like that.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Why are you bashing him?  Opie, really?  I got a beautiful woman here.  Exactly.  Of course, she's happy.  He's a newlywed.  All right.  Well, I was just asking.  It was a question more than a statement.  Uh-huh.  You rebutted it.  Yeah.  So, it's, uh...  Get it?  Get it?  What was it?  At Rusty Trombone what?  You're mean.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was Anthony, man.  He is mean.  All right.  What the fuck?  I'm kidding. 
[02:24:00]  They're a lovely couple.  You are.  Believe me.  We love your storyline, and we'll continue watching, as I'm sure.  Russ, you understand.  I mean, you know, the girl's hot.  Yeah.  We're guys.  Beautiful.  I'm one lucky guy.  That's for sure.  You certainly are, my friend.  Your Twitter photo's cool.  It's kind of like a retro look.  Yeah, like a gangster.  Like a 50s gangster look.  Yeah.  What was that for New Year's, right?  Yeah.  It was a 20th New Year's, yeah.  Oh, cool, man.  We had a good time. 
[02:24:30]  We?  I don't see power in the picture.  As a matter of fact, I haven't seen any pictures of you two together on either Twitter.  Yeah, we're supposed to be avoiding those situations.  Oh, okay.  That's why none of us are asking these questions.  A lot of mystery.  Well, it's my Twitter.  It's my Twitter.  I want pictures.  It's just my pictures.  I don't want anyone there.  It's just me.  Right.  Oh, well, that's selfish.  It's my profile.  Be honest with you.  That's selfish.  I like Russ. 
[02:25:00]  Russ can fight back.  I like this.  I love it.  Russ is all right.  All right, kids.  Did we cover all the questions?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, just the question about Tulsa World, I guess, is a big, like, news website.  Oh, right, right, right.  Well, do you guys know Tulsa World or something like that?  What is that?  It's a big news website in Tulsa.  They're in newspapers.  Yeah, yeah.  They just post the marriages, local.  Oh, they post the marriages.  Oh, and, oh, boy. 
[02:25:30]  Well, you know, we'll just leave it at that.  We don't know.  Cats out of the bag now.  Nobody certainly has cats out of the bag.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, the cat was, wait, wait.  Oh, shit.  The cat couldn't breathe a thump.  All right, wait.  All right, Russ.  So, anyway, pal, how are you?  Everyone's great.  Russ is on hold.  Oh, oh.  Oh, you put him on hold.  I feel so lucky to be talking with you guys. 
[02:26:00]  You gave me so much, so many people.  Yes.  I was like, oh, this is some big deal.  Have they been nice?  Yeah.  Well, I think, like, three or four have been, like, more big.  Like, they want bikini pictures.  Ah, yeah.  That was me.  And me.  Okay.  So, three or four.  That's people being extra nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, they've been really nice.  They've been really nice.  Does Russ get jealous?  Oh, well, I don't know.  Are you jealous, Russ?  Yeah.  Russ, you get jealous? 
[02:26:30]  Russ, you get jealous at all about other guys kind of tweeting your girl and looking  at her and saying things?  Right.  No.  I'm not worried about what they have.  They're not the ones ending the night with her.  Oh.  Well, that's true.  If it's in your parents' house, neither are you.  That's what they say.  That's bad.  I hope that's done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, if you guys did get married, how long do you have to stay married for? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, well, no.  That's the deal.  If we get married, we want to be with this relationship forever.  Forever.  That's the deal.  Forever.  All right.  Posted four months ago.  But legally, if you were to get married, let's just say with the legality, at the end  of the show, if you decide to get married, how long would you have to stay married to  stay in the country legally?  Right.  Like, I'm sure the same is with all couples.  I'm sure it's something that Russ worries about.  Yeah.  Right, Russ?  He has faith in her.  I'm not worried about it.  No, there's not anything that we need to worry about. 
[02:27:30]  No, what is the legal?  You have to go.  How are you going to be in a country legal?  No, no.  What is the legal cutoff?  Like, you can't get married.  No, now you're allowed to stay in America because you got married, obviously.  We've read the article.  So, how long do you have to stay married before you can move on and then stay in the country?  If that was something that you choose to do.  God forbid.  God forbid, obviously.  God forbid.  This KM Wizard, you're only allowed to be in America for three months.  If you can't make it, you have to go back. 
[02:28:00]  You have to sign papers and everything.  So, that's why the time is still.  I'm not in here for 90 days.  I've been here for a short time.  That's why.  The time is still moving, so we have to wait and see what happens.  You know, I have to go back to Colombia.  There's no guaranteed citizenship either.  Oh, okay.  To your conditional green card, right?  Pretty much.  Not a green card.  A visa.  Oh, okay.  Right, a visa.  A Taiwan visa. 
[02:28:30]  The fiancé visa.  That's what I have right now.  Is she spending all your money?  Not yet.  Not yet?  Well, she's got some expensive tastes, though, right?  Oh, come on.  I'm not sure.  Well, you made him buy that apartment.  And even Russ said, hey, my checkbook is going to take a beating.  Oh, please.  Come on.  That's network editing.  Oh, man.  Oh, he's got the money.  All right.  He's got the money.  Just like to set the record straight here. 
[02:29:00]  We can only base it on what we've seen on the show.  Right.  I have an editing question, too.  When, pal, when you met his friends, were they really, because it looked like they were  uncomfortable with you, or was that really a fun time when you met their friends?  Good question.  Jim Norton.  Yeah.  It was a fun time, but I think I'm, like, crazier, you know?  Okay.  The reaction to the question was much different.  Everyone was like, yeah, we're ready for some tequila.  Yeah, it was, right?  They made it look like, and when you were talking to your ex-wife about the kids, was 
[02:29:30]  that, like, what did...  Oh, that's another couple.  That's the other couple, Jimmy.  He doesn't have an ex-wife.  That's the one with the Filipino broad.  Oh, Jimmy.  No, I think it's because the time on TV is really short.  That's why you cannot see everything.  Yeah.  Of course.  But it was a fun time.  I'm having fun meeting Russ's friends and everything.  Yeah.  But, yeah, we're not a good, good friend, because I didn't spend time with them.  Right, right.  Come on, who doesn't like tequila?  You don't like tequila?  I love tequila. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, my God.  I love tequila, too.  Go down to Cabo, just do some tequila shots on the beach.  Nice.  Yes.  Oh, that's awesome.  I like that.  We should go out and drink some tequila.  I like the way you think.  Absolutely.  I like the way you think.  Absolutely.  You guys have plans of coming to New York anytime?  The Big Apple.  Yeah, we need to go to New York.  Yeah.  There you go.  Come to New York.  We'll take Pau out to some of the bars for tequila. 
[02:30:30]  You could hang out down in, you know, where?  West Village, somewhere around there?  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably Chelsea's a cool place.  It's a great city.  Chelsea's great.  And we'll take Pau out for a little, a few drinks.  I'll be there right there next day.  I don't trust you guys.  Oh, come on now, Russ.  It's freezing there, right?  You could bring your chaps.  Just leave your pants at home.  All right, all right. 
[02:31:00]  Russ is out of nowhere.  Russ rules, man.  All right.  Yeah, it's a good question.  It's really, how cold is it there right now in Oklahoma?  Yeah, it's pretty cold.  It's like 8 degrees.  Oh, my.  So when you guys, like, really recently sat outside and had those drinks at that outside  restaurant, it must have been freezing.  Yeah, it was all deep cold.  Oh.  What was that?  Because we're in, like, tank tops.  You guys are a pisser, man. 
[02:31:30]  I love it.  Yeah.  Hey, do you still like Johnny Depp?  No, that's the other girl.  Jimmy, you really are confused.  I think you need to watch a couple more episodes.  Yeah, I do love this show.  Yeah, Jimmy, come on.  Yeah, Jimmy.  How many episodes are there?  Three.  What?  There will be.  I didn't hear you.  Oh, six episodes.  Six?  That's it?  That's it?  Man, we need more.  These idiots didn't realize that they had a really good show on their hands.  Oh, man, this is a hit. 
[02:32:00]  Are you kidding me?  It should have been at least 12.  I wonder if they filmed other couples that they'll make a season two out of.  Oh, my God, only six episodes.  I'm bummed.  I already have, I've watched four.  That's actually a good question.  Do they keep filming you after you got married for season two?  Not yet.  As always, we'll see what happens.  We'll see.  They cover well.  They're good.  They got a talking to before the phone call.  Don't you dare say anything. 
[02:32:30]  Don't blow up our spot.  Watch out.  They will try to trick you.  Right.  Believe me.  I'm still single.  Believe me.  I don't have any ring on my finger.  Right.  I don't have it.  All right.  Oh, Russ, you have anything to say about that?  Hey, Russ.  I got a ring to put right on there.  Oh.  All right.  I hear you.  If you can.  I'm kidding.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  We love the show.  Yeah, we absolutely do. 
[02:33:00]  Love it.  Russ, you're a fun guy.  And, of course, you're very beautiful and great personality.  Looking forward to seeing the rest of the show.  Absolutely.  It's on TLC.  When's it on?  Sunday.  Sunday night.  Okay.  Right?  Sunday night.  All right, guys.  Yep.  All right.  Good luck to both of you.  Enjoy the rest of your day.  All right.  Bye.  Take it easy.  Bye.  See you later.  All right.  There goes Russ.  What a great pal.  Russ and pal.  Pal?  Pal.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We got rid of Russ.  Now we can talk. 
[02:33:30]  Russ is gone.  When do you want to come to New York City?  Yeah, come to New York.  And hang with us.  Yeah, I want to go.  I really want to go.  But let's see what happens if I stay in here.  Yeah, we'll go there and we can have this tequila.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, put Russ on the phone real quick.  Russ.  Hello?  Hello?  Pal?  Did you hear us say Russ? 
[02:34:00]  They're there together.  They're illegally, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  You're in the same room.  I love it.  All right.  We needed to know if you were in the same room.  We hung up with Russ and now he's on Pal's phone.  All right.  So you guys are married.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  It's obvious.  We're not married.  You have to be.  That's great.  You only had 90 days.  And when you were drinking tequila, it was summer.  Pal, are you doing any modeling work?  Maybe fall.  Are you doing modeling work? 
[02:34:30]  Oh.  In Colombia, yes.  Oh, in Colombia.  Okay.  Oh.  Hot pictures.  All right.  All right.  Now we can let you go.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, pal.  Thank you.  It doesn't matter if you guys are married.  It's still a good show to watch.  Great show.  We're going to see how it plays out.  Yeah, I hope we can get married and I can go to you.  You're married.  All right.  She's committed, though.  All right.  She's not pregnant.  Some lawyer got to her and said, do not show her the contract.  All right.  The old contract.  Russ was tripping all over.  Are you married? 
[02:35:00]  No.  How was your honeymoon?  Terrific.  All right, pal.  And Russ.  You're a funny people.  Take it easy, pal.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for being on our show today.  All right.  There they go, pal.  I'll tell you, that's going to be great for that business, though, man, because she's  fucking hot and all the...  Because everyone's going to think they could get, like, a pal.  But that's winning the lotto.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Instead, they're going to get a yuck.  Yeah.  They're going to get a fucking girl with a Star Wars phaser. 
[02:35:30]  Speaks Norwegian.  It's a blaster, Jim.  Phasers are Star Trek.  Oh.  What is it?  No.  No.  Actually, what was it called?  President of the Door Club?  Exactly.  Wow.  That was a fun little interview.  I don't think Russ likes us.  No, of course not.  That's why.  Because we were calling him gay and hitting on his wife.  I can't imagine why he wouldn't.  Humiliating him on national radio in front of his brand new foreign wife.  Why would he be angry? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, that was fun.  I wonder if he's scolding him because she was trying to keep up appearances.  Yeah, yeah.  And I was like, what's that?  Tulsa World.  Cat's out of the bag, Dad.  Tulsa World.  Yeah, yeah.  What do you do?  Just panic.  It's a paper.  Some newspaper thing.  Well.  When you say something like, oh, you can't believe everything you read.  Yeah.  Something.  You just panicked.  You guys got it.  He folded under questioning.  I can't believe there's only six episodes.  Yeah, and the fifth one airs on Sunday.  I don't think they thought it was going to catch on.  It is, right?  The fifth one is Sunday? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Fucking six episodes.  That's it.  They're going to keep filming these couples.  Because they show like 50 days to go.  So what?  They're going to go through 50 days and two episodes?  That's it.  Well, they went through four.  No, but I mean, that's a lot.  And they would be crazy not to continue filming these couples because the dynamics are unbelievable.  What would the show be, though?  It's a new show.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's a follow-up show.  Well, I mean, the same way they've done, like, uh...  Yeah, like when they do Teen Mom and stuff like that. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, they keep calling it Teen Mom, even though the mom's already given birth.  We like knowing about their prison sentences and diseases and coming out of closets, perhaps.  Right.  You know.  Like, I want to know, will they do a follow-up show?  Because they're going to have new couples next season.  Do you think Russ knows that, and that's what he's not happy about, the fact that the way they edit it or what have you, makes him look like he's not very interested?  Or, yeah, they certainly make him look like he's a bit dull.  Yeah.  Dull? 
[02:37:30]  He's like, what made you think, you know, I wasn't into her in the hot tub?  It's like, well, that's what I saw.  The little kiss is like, well, it wasn't very good.  At this point, I think we've got to say that we have no fucking idea.  I have no idea.  I've never had any idea.  It's just what we see when we watch the show.  We watch the show, and they're editing and stuff like that.  There certainly could be some editing going on.  It comes off a little mysterious.  Right.  So.  Quite.  But he seems annoyed at that.  He seems annoyed at the way it's edited.  Oh, yeah, he certainly does.  Absolutely.  He's probably like, of course I'm into her. 
[02:38:00]  Cowboy, all male.  Yeah, who the fuck?  They edit, like, I knew that that scene was edited bad when they're showing the friends, like,  the music.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're looking at her like, she's crazy.  I'm like, they probably had a great time that day.  Great time.  He might just be a gentleman.  Maybe he's not a pig of a man.  Yeah, wow.  There are people that don't fuck before marriage.  I don't get it, but, I mean, Pow didn't get it, but.  You could do things without fucking, too.  Jesus.  Bury your face between those tits.  You gotta test drive that shit. 
[02:38:30]  That's true.  I like a good test drive.  Get cock in there.  Also, Pow's wearing a wedding ring in one of the photos that she posted on Twitter.  Well, oh, no, is that it?  The wedding ring.  Oh, what happened?  Oh, what a waste.  Yeah.  Not only do I like a good test drive, but what I do is I go into the dealership, and I fucking  check out the rear trunk, and then I fucking ignore the car.  I come all over the fucking back window and ignore the car, or I shoot a load on it, and 
[02:39:00]  then I say, you use the windshield wipers.  Tell it to drive home.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Drive yourself through the car wash.  We got a guy from Tulsa that wants in, badly.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  Long time.  First time.  Thanks, Joe.  Yeah.  What says you?  That should be the new thing for the caller.  What says you?  I hate when whoever does that.  I said that I'm looking at the state marriage records for October the 7th, and it appears 
[02:39:30]  our friend, Russell Jean Mayfield, paid a whopping $50 to marry, I'm going to give this  a try, Paola Andrea Vesca Salcedo.  Whoa.  And how do you have access to those records, sir?  It's OSCN.net.  It's the Oklahoma State court record.  I got her marriage license.  I guess it's not easy to cover up a marriage.  Right.  You can't. 
[02:40:00]  For a dopey TV show.  For a dopey TV show, yeah.  All I did was type in the name Paola, and interestingly, she's the only person in Oklahoma  with that name.  Yeah, that would make sense.  Wow.  There you go.  Marriage license.  There it is.  Well, you know.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  There's the marriage license.  She changed her name.  Did she?  Yeah, to his last name.  Oh.  Okay.  Hmm.  Damn.  So they did some of that consummating of the marriage, you think? 
[02:40:30]  No, probably not.  You don't think so?  Eh, consummate.  He said consummate schmance-mate.  Right.  All right.  We got Lady Di on hold.  We're going to take a break, and we're going to talk to her, I guess.  Oh, both extremes from that.  Oh, right.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola. 
[02:41:00]  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  Paola.  I'm just fixated on Supergroup Asia.  That's why I'm not even thinking about other bands.  Thank you, Anthony.  Don't forget, we released our latest podcast yesterday. 
[02:41:30]  This week, it's Penn Jillette and Louis C.K. on the same podcast.  Go get that, please.  Dare I say, great appearances by both.  Absolutely.  For the people asking, next week will be Rogan and Ricky Gervais on the same podcast.  That's huge.  Again, great appearances.  Both these podcasts are huge.  We want to make sure our numbers are good, so spread the word.  Can you look at those numbers, see if they're any good?  Do you want to see your number?  I want to see the whole thing.  Actually, I don't even look at my number. 
[02:42:00]  Jimmy's moving up the charts.  Climbing the charts.  He's up to Jim Norton Hates Animals, I believe, is one of the top five ONA podcasts we've done.  We've done 40 about, 39 to 40.  Yeah.  Let's take a look at the numbers here.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  All right.  I see what's going on here.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:42:30]  Nice?  Yeah.  Nicey-nice.  I'm over here now.  Yeah, I think Jimmy's got a nice number right there.  You know, I was watching Rosemary's Baby last night.  Really?  And, of course, Mia Farrow's in that.  Mm-hmm.  She's just adorable in that one, I've got to say.  With the short hair.  Big doe eyes.  You know, that's the Dakota building.  I know.  Oh, that's right.  Yes, it's the Dakota.  Oh, I know.  That's where Lennon was shot.  Uh-huh.  Rosemary.  Is that a good show?  Well, same building Lennon was shot in front of. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  The building in Rosemary's Baby.  Rosemary's Baby.  That's what I was trying to say.  Yes.  But, God, that movie's fucking good.  It's creepy.  It is creepy.  It's a good movie, though.  But the whole Mia Farrow thing, and then that movie's directed by Roman Polanski, and, like,  she's defending, I guess, Polanski.  Something's coming up.  She was, no.  Or something happened already.  She's a character witness.  Right, a character witness for Roman Polanski, and, of course, now you've got this whole  Woody Allen and the daughter debacle, and you would think she would be the one that would 
[02:43:30]  be a little more sensitive about issues like that.  It's just such a weird situation.  Yeah, because her daughter's basically saying, how can you support Woody for what he did to  me, but Mia Farrow is supporting Roman Polanski.  Right, a guy that kind of did very similar things, right?  Can't come back into the country.  He was admitted to doing things.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  So, that is interesting.  That just was a very odd kind of thing.  Well, Woody's going to have something in the New York Times this weekend, I believe. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he's going to rebut.  Oh, a little rebuttal?  He's going to throw his own daughter under the bus.  He has to.  If it's not true...  His own daughter he's going to throw under the bus and blame...  I'm sure he's going to just blame Mia Farrow for brainwashing her or something.  I don't think he'll bash the daughter.  He'll probably say that she was very young, and she probably believes these things, but it's  a lie.  She was brainwashed kind of a thing.  Yeah.  But a buddy of mine is a lawyer, and we've stayed friends ever since that whole thing 
[02:44:30]  happened, the guy who was my lawyer.  We went out to lunch the other day, and we were talking about the Woody case.  I said to him, why wouldn't Woody just come out?  The legal culpability of just coming out and going, look, why is he letting his lawyer talk  for him?  He explained some type of illegality where, because the lawyer, because there's a public  figure involved, can deny it, but if Woody comes out and says anything, everybody knows  that he knows what the truth is, so he might be liable for a lawsuit.  There was some kind of a weird legal technicality, which is why it's smarter to talk to the lawyer. 
[02:45:00]  It just comes off as insincere.  That was not, by the way, the legal explanation I was given.  Right.  That was a little different when he told it to you.  That was filtered through a dummy machine.  That was not a lawyer's lawsuit, something about a lawyer.  Yes.  Boy, does it get lost in translation with me.  I hear it perfectly.  I hear it perfectly.  And then it comes out like, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, 
[02:45:30]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  What I'm listening to.  Let's say hi to Lady Di.  We gave her an ultimatum about an hour ago.  Time's about up.  So Lady Di is back on the phone, and we've got the super show tomorrow.  It's sponsored by IHateStevenSinger.com.  And you, out of nowhere, decided you weren't coming in tomorrow with Marion.  And so we basically said if you don't come in tomorrow, you're pretty much dead to us.  So you said you would call Marion and reconsider. 
[02:46:00]  And so now you're calling us back to discuss this further.  So I would assume at this point you have talked to Marion, who said she has this stomach bug.  And we were suspicious of that because she has the stomach bug, but she's at work today.  So we're thinking that the stomach bug can't be that bad.  So if she could go to work, why wouldn't she come in here tomorrow so we can wish her a happy birthday,  even though the show's not about her birthday, but it would be a side thing. 
[02:46:30]  And maybe we would even get some kind of cake for Marion and the big birthday.  But certainly that's not why we're bringing everyone together for Super Show 2.  Thank you.  Listen to me.  I am going to the show tomorrow.  Oh.  Tomorrow.  I will be there tomorrow, okay?  Cool.  Nice.  Now, why the change of clogged heart?  And obviously in the end it was up to you, you know. 
[02:47:00]  I will be there tomorrow.  If you want to call Marion, you can call her up, okay?  But I will be there tomorrow.  What happened to change your mind?  Yeah.  Did you call Marion?  Yeah.  She said do whatever you want.  If you want to go out there in this mess, I don't know what mess is out there, but.  What mess?  There's no mess.  The roads are fucking fine.  No, she said if you want to go outside, you mess.  What a cake.  I'm just trying to tell you that I will be there tomorrow, okay?  Yeah, too bad Colin won't be here, but you'll see him when he comes into March. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, well, whatever.  Oh.  Whatever.  What's the matter?  You sound like this is a fucking problem.  Yeah, man.  What's up?  We want happy, fun people.  Right.  Happy, fun people at this.  Right.  You're none of those things.  Yes.  I love seeing you guys.  It doesn't bother me to spend tomorrow, okay?  I just go well.  Tomorrow.  I was just supposed to say, well, we love seeing you too.  Yeah, exactly.  You just go well.  I just went well.  Well.  Well, well, well.  You love me in your own way. 
[02:48:00]  How do you get here, Lady Di?  I get there by train, and I take a cab.  Train.  Yeah.  Does that bring back any memories, the train?  Oh, boy.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't talk about that again.  About what?  What are they talking about?  I don't know about what?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Talking about what?  I was talking about a train.  No, no, no.  You're talking about my son's dad again.  Don't talk about that.  No, I wasn't.  Oh, man.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on. 
[02:48:30]  Lady Di, do you watch 90 Day Fiance?  Because Pow has decided to call us back.  This is pretty fucking cool.  Let's say hi to Pow again.  Pow.  Yeah, I got him out of the house.  I just want to tell Anthony, I do like the balls.  And speaking of balls, Lady Di, you fucking god, because you're a fucking man, you fucking  animal.  Fuck you.  Wow.  We got tricks.  We really thought it was Pow called.  I thought.  That wasn't Pow.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Okay. 
[02:49:00]  Who thought it was Pow?  I don't even know who he is.  Oh, no.  I don't know who he is.  She is.  She is.  I don't know who he is.  You know nothing about him.  The sound your feet make when you walk.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  I just.  What I'd love to hear coming out of your fucking, out of your room, there's a shotgun left there.  Lady Di, I got to ask you something.  I got to ask you something.  Why do you have a syringe hanging from your arm right now? 
[02:49:30]  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  I got to get a bed bug away.  You got to get what?  No.  Hold on.  You're shooing a bed bug away?  Yeah.  You're in a rolling snowball.  Oh, Christ.  What's a rolling snowball?  Oh, God.  Is he?  Yes.  What is he?  Oh, is she snowballing him?  She's snowballing him.  What is Captain Junkyard saying?  I don't know what he's talking about.  Lady Di, answer my question.  Why do you have a syringe hanging from your arm?  That's crazy.  What's a snowball?  What are you talking about?  I don't have no syringe hanging from my arm. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, fuck.  Okay.  Because I got bad info right now.  Yeah, I thought so.  Yeah.  No, you're wrong.  All right.  You can.  You can get here tomorrow, no problem, Lady Di, because we can arrange.  One of our staff members has offered to go to your house and pick you up.  Get the fuck out of who?  Oh, no, no, no.  You don't have to pick me up.  If you want to pick me up, you'll be facing backwards and out from the trailer.  Right.  Your nose will be sticking through one of those slots.  Yeah, through a slat on the side of a slat.  A slat, right. 
[02:50:30]  He's your horse.  Yeah.  Hold on.  I have to sit down.  Of course you do.  Of course.  And cab.  That's the way I get there.  No, we're going to pick you up tomorrow.  Iraq's going to pick you up and give you a nice ride in like a lady.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yep.  Yeah, he just wants an excuse to get in later.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Yeah, a serious exam.  Yeah, a serious exam.  How do I hope she puts bed bugs in Iraq's car?  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  You know how happy bed bugs would be if they saw him with fat arms? 
[02:51:00]  You don't have to do that.  I get dropped off at the train station.  Bill drops me off.  Oh, my God.  She does.  Then I take the train.  That's it.  She turns the truck really fast and she falls off the back like a load of hay.  That's how I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Does the gate go down when you walk on the tracks?  Because you're as heavy as a train.  No.  Oh, okay.  She told me no.  I'm waiting to hear the ding.  No.  What's the ding, ding?  Ding, ding?  Ding, ding?

Retarded?  Yeah, he's retired.  Bill was a good man.  He worked his ass off.  Yeah.  How he got stuck with Lady Di, I don't know.  He caught a blowjob from her.  Yeah.  I tried, but they didn't work.  She won't blow you, Bill.  Hell no.  You want her to blow you, Bill.  Get that bitch to get out, then. 
[02:58:00]  No, it hurts.  Why?  She used the teeth?  Oh, she's got anything that goes in her mouth goes through a fucking auger.  It's like throwing fucking wood into a wood chipper, right?

It doesn't matter.  Put Lady Di on the phone.  Please, more about you.  Tired?  I got money.  I don't care.  I got money.  I don't care what I do.  We got it.  Rap star now?  I said congratulations.  That's good for you, buddy.  Bill, what do you do for a living?  Yeah.  We work.  I ran a, you say, shipping company, like AP, no, I say the name. 
[02:59:00]  Well, what do you do now?  Yeah.  Right now, I go out, shop, and eat and sleep.  So you don't work?  Do you charge people to see the drunken, talking otter that you live with?  No, I don't have to.  They all know it.  Say what?  I don't know.  Say what?  All right.  Can we let Bill go?  No, no.  I just, I made a good living, $35 an hour.  Just put Di on the phone. 
[02:59:30]  $35 an hour.  That's some good coin, Bill.  That's very bad.  That's up after a while.  I only worked a half hour a week, though.  It's a terrible job.  $17.50 before that.  It was just because of the millionaires.  Huh?  Yeah.  Well, multi, Bill.  Get it straight.  Right.  Anyone can own $1 million.  That's nothing these days.  I paid, you know what kills me?  Well, you millionaires, I pay more taxes than you do.  Nah, I highly doubt that. 
[03:00:00]  To answer your question is to drink them.  Yeah.  I bet you don't.  All right, Bill.  It was great talking to you.  All right.  Can we talk to Lady Di?  Yeah.  Billy!  What?  No, we're trying to cheat me.  I hate when we get stuck in the mud with phone calls.  It's the worst.  We're just stuck.  Yeah.  Where's Lady Di?  Lady Di.  Hold on, hold on.  What's she doing?  Throwing out?  Bill.  Yeah, Di. 
[03:00:30]  No, I had a good job.  She's just 25 years, one job.  How much do you make an hour?  More about that.  Yeah, 35.  35?  I wish the United States would call and say your money disappeared.  I was a crane operator and a mechanic.  A mechanic and crane operator.  Wow.  So did that mean you were trying to transfer phone calls from birds?  You what?  You guys are a bunch of freaking jerks. 
[03:01:00]  You'd relay the call.  Crane operator again.  Yes, we got it.  Or a crane was calling another.  And you would be the operator.  Right.  Crane operator.  That's good.  All right.  That's good.  At least you could die off the couch.  You live with a monster. 
[03:01:30]  You guys are jerks, but I tell you what.  Yeah.  Funny jerks, right?  Yeah, you live funny like hell.  All right.  All right.  We got to talk to Lady Di, because someone has a story about Lady Di.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to listen to me?  That's good.  Was it Charlotte?  Was there a book called Water for Di? 
[03:02:00]  He's calling with his story.  Oh, you just put Lady Di on the phone.  Put Lady Di on the phone.  Hold on, Bill.  One more question.  No.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Yeah.  She's dropping a fucking stewy deuce.  It's a stringy long stool.  Natty Ice fucking dump.  Yeah.  Can you go in the bathroom?  We want to hear her shitting.  Yeah, she's out.  Here you go.  Look at your beef telephone pole.  Oh, fuck.  Lady Di.  She was seen of Hiroshima.  Oh, my God.  Revisit Jimmy's line on drinking. 
[03:02:30]  What was the line?  Oh, there was a lot of Bill Sentai.  Hey, guys.  I'll put Bill back.  Hold on.  We need Bill.  We got Derek in Jersey City.  He saw you recently, Lady Di.  Listen to Derek.  Go ahead.  Hey, Diana.  Okay.  Yeah?  Do you recall two days ago leaving a Burger King with Takeout wearing a sweatshirt and sweatpants?  You were vomiting next to your Ford Explorer two days ago a mile outside of Jersey City. 
[03:03:00]  Di comment?  Comment?  Yeah.  No.  Diana.  Diana.  I've seen multiple photos of you on Twitter.  It was disgusting.  I actually wanted to go over and get a photo with you.  You were gagging and vomiting all next to your Explorer.  You were on a Ford Explorer, correct?  Say that one more time.  Oh, my God.  Why were you vomiting?  Did you catch a little glimpse of that side view mirror? 
[03:03:30]  What are you talking about?  Di.  Listen to him.  Do you own a Ford Explorer?  Do I own a one of Ford Explorer?  Where's Bill?  All right.  You own a Ford Explorer.  Do you eat at Burger King?  Were you at a Burger King?  Once in a while.  Were you there a couple days ago?  Uh, the one that's over here on top of Broad Street.  Right.  Is that the one, Derek?  Yes.  Guys, I'm so sorry I didn't film this.  This filthy cunt was throwing up all next to her car. 
[03:04:00]  Lady Di.  He saw you there.  This guy saw you there at the Burger King that you were talking about with the Ford Explorer.  You had a bag of Burger King, and you were puking outside your vehicle.  Is that true?  He's lying to you.  I'm not lying.  Why would he have all the information correct?  Because, first of all, I don't puke in front of a Burger King. 
[03:04:30]  And, first of all, I don't puke anyway.  It wasn't in front of the Burger King.  It was on the side of your Explorer.  Yeah, next to your Ford Explorer.  Yeah.  Oh!  Put Bill on.  Hold on.  I will give her credit.  There was a drive-thru at the Burger King.  She did get out of the car, walked to get takeout, and then walked from the inside back to her car.  So she was throwing up, burying her fucking food.  Whatever you say.  Maybe she was feeding her young rhinoceros. 
[03:05:00]  What do you mean, whatever?  Hey, by the way, guys.  Yeah.  I need to ask you a question.  Uh-huh.  Whatever happened to Frenchie, remember Frenchie?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I'm sure he's doing well out there somewhere.  Not a second.  Wow.  It was a pill.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  No, so you were puking outside Burger King.  Okay.  We got it.  What was your stomach upset from the Natty Ice?  Yeah, whatever.  No.  Wow. 
[03:05:30]  Believe it.  Believe it.  Go ahead.  I kind of do believe it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I think I believe this one, too.  I asked you a question.  You're a compulsive liar.  Right.  We all know that.  We don't know what happened to Frenchie.  Stop.  Who cares?  Oh, Frenchie called yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Jim.  Yeah.  That's fine.  You want Frenchie?  He called yesterday.  Frenchie called yesterday?  Yes, he was on yesterday.  Oh.  All right.  Okay.  Where's Bill?  How was he doing?  He was calling you a cunt.  I was sitting in the kitchen. 
[03:06:00]  Oh.  Lady Di, this is Frenchie.  How are you doing, Lady Di?  What was that?  There's Frenchie.  Wait a minute.  There you go.  Hello, this is Frenchie.  How are you doing today, you cunt?  Ah, see?  It's Frenchie, Lady Di.  Oh, my God.  You cunt.  Guy, I haven't seen you in years.  Thanks for calling me over there.  How are you guys doing today?  I'm pretty good there, Frenchie.  That is Frenchie, definitely.  Hi, Frenchie.  How are you doing?  I went, you filthy cunt. 
[03:06:30]  I heard you throw up at a fucking Burger King.  You make me sick.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  I did not throw up at a Burger King.  Well, I heard this on the radio.  I heard this call.  You're filthy.  Oh, my God.  You make me sick, you cunt.  Oh, my God.  Man, you guys are cracking me up right now.  Oh, wow.  I did not.  You told us.  Like Humpty Dumpty.  You asked what happened to Frenchie. 
[03:07:00]  We got him on the line for you.  Yeah.  Excuse me, guys.  Hold me.  Lady Di, let me ask you a question.  Do you have a second for me?  Do I have a what for you?  A second.  Fuck.  A second.  Go ahead.  Okay, let me ask.  So I heard that you're living with a man.  His name's Bill.  Supposedly, I've been hearing rumors that he sticks his dick in your ass.  Is that correct?  Excuse me.  Is this Frenchie? 
[03:07:30]  Who am I talking to?  It's Frenchie.  Jesus Christ.  Is this Frenchie?  You feel the cunt?  Do you not hear me?  Oh, my God.  It's a little more Frenchie.  Lady Di.  You're the worst.  I'm the worst?  Yeah, I'm the worst.  You're puking at a Burger King next to your Ford Explorer.  All right.  Hey, Dirk, thanks for the story, buddy.  Thanks, guys.  I'll see you.  I'll see you.  Good to hear from Frenchie as well, guys. 
[03:08:00]  I'll see you guys.  And we got, Lady Di, we got Bill on the phone from your apartment.  Bill, you're on with Lady Di.  It's funny.  I got to know this joke.  Why did the chicken cross the road?  Why?  Because Lady Di was on the other side with the balls out in the fork, you fucking man.  Jesus, I got tricked again.  I think I got tricked.  I thought it was Bill from your house. 
[03:08:30]  We got to get a different call screener.  Yeah.  All right, Lady Di, so you're going to be in tomorrow?  Yes, I will.  Oh, that's all we need to know.  Okay.  For the super show, even though it's going to be a little light.  I don't think so.  Do we get rich?  I'm with her here.  Yeah, Voss is coming in.  Oh, good.  We're going to have...  What?  You're babbling, Lady Di.  Hot chicks are coming in.  Oh, good.  Nice.  Yeah.  And this slob?  What do you guys want?  Do you know their names?  I'll email them to you.  All right, Lady Di.  What, Lady Di?  All right, Lady Di, thanks for calling. 
[03:09:00]  Thanks for calling in.  All right, we'll see you tomorrow, all right?  Okay, very good.  Okay.  Very good.  What time are you coming in tomorrow, Lady?  I should be there...  Oh, let me see.  We're on 7 o'clock.  Let's make it 7.  Let's do it.  You want to sneak a Natty Ice in her, too, for yourself?  Oh, no.  I'm not going to...  Do we need some in the green room?  Pack them in the purse, Lady Di.  Pack them in the purse.  A few Natty Ice's in the green room, I think, right?  Well, some kind of flask or something that she'll drink from last time.  Yeah, she was married to the Coke bottle last time. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, that Coke bottle.  Right, with the booze in it.  Well, what kind of booze was in that Coke bottle?  There was nothing in the Coke bottle, just Coca-Cola.  No, I don't think so.  No one holds on to a Coke can like that.  No.  I always did that, so that's why I wouldn't cough a lot.  So you wouldn't cough a lot?  Yeah.  Why do you cough a lot?  Because in the morning when I get up, you could even ask Bill about this, I cough and gag a lot.  In the morning.  What an unhealthy monster. 
[03:10:00]  Until the entire cud comes up?  Yeah.  Just what a fucking behemoth.  Now, tell me something.  Yeah.  Who else is going to be in the studio besides me?  I can't say it this time.  No one can be in the studio besides you.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Yes.  What about Bobo?  Is he going to be in there?  I can't say it this time.  It's top secret.  It is.  Top secret?  Yeah, it really is. 
[03:10:30]  Paul McCartney?  No.  Well, that's not confirmed.  No.  We do have a big celebrity coming in, though.  Big celeb.  But we can't tell you right now.  Yeah, no joke there.  That's true.  A fan of the show.  Yeah, he knows who you are, Lady Di, and yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You'll know him in a second.  All right.  You'll know him before he even speaks.  Okay.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Peter Tork?  No, it's not Peter fucking Tork.  We said a celebrity.  Yeah, we would never have Peter Tork in this fucking studio.  Peter Tork is a celebrity.  Unless we could throw hammers at him. 
[03:11:00]  Whoever it is, I'll get to meet him and, you know, whatever.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow, Lady Di.  All right.  See you tomorrow.  Okay?  Wonderful.  Thank you.  The super show is on for tomorrow.  Hopefully, it won't be a bust.  She's a big celebrity.  She says, Peter Tork.  What a idiot she is.  Oh.  I kind of.  I stand her.  I kind of bombed him.  Peter Tork.  Peter Tork.  You don't think he's a big celebrity?  Oh, God.  Who the hell likes Peter Tork? 
[03:11:30]  He's not even the, like, biggest monkey.  He's, like, the fourth biggest monkey.  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  See, I thought.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Ding, ding.  Just one.  What are we going to say hi to TJ in South Texas?  Ah.  TJ.  How y'all doing, man?  I got to tell you, man.  I'm sitting out here in the fucking oil field, and I got me a damn new piece when I was digging  on this XM radio, and I come across you.  Man, y'all funnier than a $5 whore on nickel.  Now, I ain't never heard so funny in my life.  I like that. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's a bit, right?  It's got to be.  You want to take a break, then we'll finish up?  That sounds good.  Jimmy's leaving us.  Aw.  Yeah, I got to be on a train at 11, and DC, man, is all sold out.  That's awesome.  Good.  Week after is Borgata, which you guys are coming to.  Yes, go to that one.  That'd be good.  Tickets available for the Saturday Late Show, and then the 28th in Pittsburgh, I think tickets  are available.  Netflix has helped a lot, man.  That's good to hear.  Shit.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[03:12:30]  Maybe it's because we're doing better radio.  Oh, who knows?  No, but with the radio, I can feel it's helping a little bit on the draw on the road.  Well, have fun in Washington, Jimmy.  We'll see you Monday.  Yeah.  And we're going to finish up next.  Stay there.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  Marriage is bumpy.  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff.  It's like, it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the Twittering, which is rich, and the other person is selling all  the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie. 
[03:13:00]  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with, like, casually loving touching?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't,  like it hasn't, hasn't figured out how to caress.  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter  her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face. 
[03:13:30]  Wow, Rich.  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie and rest a little easier  knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him, quite well, by the way, and he farted.  No, you didn't.  I bet he got mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard.  I've seen that a whole thing.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul. 
[03:14:00]  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers babysitting a young Opie.  You remember.  I used to babysit you.  I'd poke my you-know-what through the crib and you'd grab it.  He was a little blue-eyed Gregorio. 
[03:14:30]  He was the cutest one.  Yeah, I told you.  Him and his brother would play the game.  The peenie flip.  But I'd say, go ahead, flip your peenie.  Sure.  And his mother would take pictures.  Take pictures when he was in the tub.  Yeah, and then the court said she had to leave, so she went with a Jewish fella.  I'd kiss his shoulders real tender.  And I'd say, this is what happens.  The man puts it in.  I'm going to fertilize you.

Ready to do a little time with Sam Roberts, I see.  Oh, yeah.  It's always a treat, right?  We're like gay lovers on air.  Oh, on air.  Damn.  Relationship.  We went over this before, Who Kid came out of the Grammys, because you haven't talked  to Who Kid since the Grammys, though, with the realization that hip-hop is gay now.  Hip-hop is gay.  At one point it was black, now it's gay, correct? 
[03:17:30]  Now it's gay.  What happened?  That Macklemore fucking asshole, right?  He doesn't turn me into a gay person.  Yeah.  And I'm hip-hop, you know what I'm saying?  So I'm gay now.  Now you're gay.  But that's cool, though.  I don't like the Macklemore.  I think he's a phony.  When I was three, I thought I was gay.  Shut up.  It's okay to be gay.  It's fine to be gay.  But he's lying.  In the third grade, you don't think you're gay?  In the third grade, he thinks he's gay.  You don't even know what boobies are yet.  What are you talking about?  You call idiots in your class gay in the third grade, because you don't even know what it 
[03:18:00]  means.  You have no clue what it means, so you just say, you gay.  Right.  That's because you gay.  I love those kids.  In the third grade, I thought I was gay.  Shut up.  Did you?  I feel very glowy.  I feel like I have power or something.  Now that I'm gay, I feel like I can control the world.  You do.  Gays have a lot of power.  Yeah, I just got a proof of a new car and shit.  Oh, shit.  Wait, I got a couple questions.  I just need a license.  Did you fucking party with the Seahawks after the Super Bowl? 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, the whole...  I saw your pictures.  I followed you on Instagram.  Yeah, it was pretty fucking cool.  The whole team came, and then...  And P. Diddy, and who else?  All the gay rappers came, because we're all gay now.  The gay rappers, yeah.  Rick Ross.  Rick Ross.  Rick Ross was there.  That bounce.  Nelly.  What kind of Seahawks you got?  You got the good ones?  Or kind of the scrubs?  The good ones didn't really get in the game.  Two of the good ones didn't want to take photos, because they were, like, fucked up and high.  Oh, okay.  Right.  They won.  I was like, yo, let's take a photo.  I mean, you can't get trouble. 
[03:19:00]  Of course you're fucked up.  You won the Super Bowl.  Richard Sherman had his, like, I think he had his thumb in his mouth or something.  I don't know.  Was Sherman really there?  Yeah, he was there, but he had, like, a big thumb in his mouth.  Why?  He was spooning himself.  I don't know.  So he couldn't talk.  What, he was just sitting in the corner with his thumb in his mouth?  That's crazy.  Did he have, like, an oral fixation?  It was crazy.  That's weird.  Was he on his crutches?  No.  He was, uh, they had some security.  Who can lies?  I don't know what's real anymore.  You can't make this up, though. 
[03:19:30]  Can I be the Who Kid translator?  Go ahead.  How many lies has he told?  Troy was there.  I guess Richard Sherman was not, was not, uh, spooning himself.  Sucking his thumb.  I didn't know what to call it.  He had his thumb in his mouth, so I thought it was spooning.  But he mixes real shit with, like, fucking lies.  I know, I know he was with P. Diddy.  He was with P. Diddy.  And a few of the Seahawks.  And Rick Ross and Killer K.  But then he has to pump it up with lies.  Yo, it's the truth, son.  Look at these pictures.  They're amazing.  You never get a straight answer.  It's like every interrogation on First 48. 
[03:20:00]  I don't know.  I'm going in, nigga.  Some happened.  Some.  Like, it's like the, oh, there's nobodies right there.  What do you mean?  That's two chains.  That's two chains right there.  Motherfucking two chains.  Two chains.  Why doesn't someone just come up with three chains and put him out of business?  I know.  Hey, you think three chains would kick his ass?  It would fuck him up because he would have to change all his marketing.  He's a nigga gay.  Neil Patrick Harris.  I was on a flight with Doogie Howser because I had missed my flight.  Yeah?  Was he sitting right next to you?  Yeah, we were talking about like.  How scared was he? 
[03:20:30]  He was drinking.  He was like drinking like crazy.  Was he holding his purse?  Yeah, like some ill socks.  It was silky and.  Yeah.  It was so silky.  He's out of the closet.  Yeah, I know that.  Gay guy.  Yeah, we shared a drink.  Did you talk about your gayness being a rapper?  Yeah, I told him I was gay, too.  What were you drinking out of that you shared?  I think it was Merlot.  Oh.  Whoa, Merlot.  It was red.  It should fall on my pants, too.  Oh, shit.  Can't wash that shit.  Can't wash that shit.  I gotta throw the pants away. 
[03:21:00]  Here he is with the Seahawks.  He was partying with the Seahawks after the Super Bowl.  I know.  So why does he just say that?  Look out all that were fucked up, though.  Yeah, they were all fucked up.  Those are nobody, Seahawks.  They're okay.  They're quacking.  They don't get in the game.  They're like, quack, quack, quack.  They don't get a ring, but they didn't get in the game.  They got a ring.  They all get rings, right?  Everyone.  And Troy Kwan was partying with you?  Troy Kwan was going hard in there.  Yeah.  What?  Look at him.  Yeah, look at Troy.  Dancing like a nigga.  Look at him. 
[03:21:30]  Dancing.  He's got a drink in his hand.  Girl wants no part of him.  Right.  Two-Chains outfit.  Damn.  What the fuck is that?  He's always weird looking.  Two-Chains.  What is that Urkel-looking fucking getup he's got on?  He has a fur vest.  A fur vest.  With a sweater.  With like a cardigan sweater over it.  How the fuck, man?  Yeah, that'll be the new thing now.  He's the truth right now.  You just throw some shit on and it becomes a new thing?  I don't know how you black guys are bundled up in clubs.  It's a hot fucking club.  Look at it.  P. Diddy's wearing a fur coat. 
[03:22:00]  Who's got a mask on?  No, that's a meat bill.  That's fucking.  He's wearing a Leona Helmsley fur fucking coat.  Right.  In a scorching hot club.  Holy shit.  Black guys like it Africa hot no matter where they are.  Spicy armpits.  Spicy armpits.  No one likes P. Diddy, right?  You can speak openly.  Oh, sure.  People love him.  I mean, he made $40 million, so that's what I love.  Good for him.  Do people take him seriously, though, as a rapper?  Yo, wherever he was at, the shit was sold out. 
[03:22:30]  It was packed.  True.  And bitches be there, you know what I'm saying?  Bitches.  You like bitches being in it.  Oh, and they don't like Diddy.  They think that he leeched off of Biggie Smalls.  You think so?  I don't.  He wouldn't be famous if Biggie Smalls left.  Maggots don't use a corpse as much as fucking Diddy did.  There you go.  Holy shit.  I mean, I heard about the, they got the hologram on tour now, the Biggie hologram.  Oh, Biggie hologram?  Is that right?  Yeah, so you get to see him, like, wiggle and everything.  Wow. 
[03:23:00]  They made the hologram wiggle?  It's like a G per pixicle.  Wow.  That's a lot of pixicles, too.  That's pretty cool.  How much is that?  Like a $2 million hologram?  I mean, how many pixicles is Biggie Smalls?  That's a lot of pixicles.  That's a lot of pixicles.  Get a computer nigga in here.  I'm going home.  Okay, it's a pleasure seeing you.  Always a pleasure, man.  We got the Super Show tomorrow.  Make sure everyone checks that out.  Hopefully, we'll be a bust.  Are you around tomorrow?  Yeah, I'm around tomorrow.  Oh, you want to come in for the Super Show?  I heard, what's the name of you?  We're Shorty Guy.  Lady Di.  Lady Di is coming in. 
[03:23:30]  We're Shorty Guy.  Come on in.  Lady Di loves Who Dad.  Okay, what time is that?  What time are you all starting at?  What time?  We started at 6.30.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck that.  I think I'll make a special appearance for him once ever.  Yeah, you know, he's coming at 6.30, that's for sure.  I'll come later.  He'll start getting good around 8, 8.30.  And good news for you, Who Kid.  What?  We're going to have bitches in studio.  That's right.  We got bitches coming.  We got naked games to play with them.  I thought you'd be here with one of your bitches.  I'm here.  I'll be here early. 
[03:24:00]  Penthouse girl is coming in.  What?  Oh, one of them that you know.  Which one?  Mary Jean.  Oh, get out of here.  That's my bitch.  Yeah, she'll be in tomorrow.  Fuck, they're in the car.  Nice.  So we'll get into that when we speak to her tomorrow.  In the car.  Yeah.  The cops is right next to us, too.  Is that right?  Jesus.  Fucking righteous.  You have photos?  How?  I'm coming out.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Out of the closet.  We're not on, are we?  Yeah.  Yeah, we are.  Oh, fuck.  Ah, fuck.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.  All right. 
[03:24:30]  Why don't you just go straight to the intro?  Oh, we could do that.  You don't need an intro.  Just keep going.  All right.  Why does everything have to be so fancy?  Just keep going.  This is a professional broadcaster, man.  Exactly who, Kit, because I'm a professional broadcaster.  You need the fucking intro?  Yeah.  I mean, a professional broadcaster.  You guys had Stacey Keats talking about you for 10 minutes before you came on the air.  It's true.  I got to have footsteps.  15.  You're right.  Bye, boo.  That was the abridged version.  They're looking good. 
[03:25:00]  Anthony, you go home on nights like this excited about tomorrow?  Mm-mm.  Yes.  For the super show?  I get so fucking pumped up thinking, oh, it's going to be great, super show.  I have high expectations.  Star-studded.  It's going to be pussy, yeah.  Not only, yeah, exactly.  Not only do we have the freaks coming in.  Yeah.  The very funny Rich Voss will be here, and...  Bitches.  Bitches.  Are they hot fucking penthouse bitches?  Hot bitches.  Are they going to be prude-ass bitches?  No, I sent, uh...  I want to see some pussy.  I sent some emails about exactly what was to be expected, and you know what? 
[03:25:30]  You'll be very proud, Anthony.  Yeah.  I got an email back, and it said, this girl, uh, I can get her to come in, but she prefers  to not take off her top.  Is that cool?  And you know what I said?  No.  No, it's not cool.  Good.  Find another girl.  Find another bitch that'll take her fucking top off.  I don't need that shit.  Get my wife in here.  It's been clarified.  Yeah, if we want to bring prudes in here that aren't going to show tits, just fucking  bring any girl.  Right.  You know, we want fucking tits. 
[03:26:00]  Hell yeah.  And pussies a plus, too.  If they're willing to even pull the panties aside a little, show some lipids.  I love that, too.  Well, we got some things in mind for tomorrow, so it should, I think...  Nice.  It's going to be one of those things...  I feel like a lot of times the girls come in here, and they don't want to take their  clothes off...  What kind of shit is that?  ...because it's uncomfortable, because it just kind of gets...  Look, I don't want to insult you.  It kind of gets a little lecherous, and it just ends up being you, Opie, and Jim going,  all right, so what, are you going to take your pants off or what?  But if they did it right away, then we wouldn't have to beg like that. 
[03:26:30]  You think I like begging these fucking bitches...  No, you got pride.  ...to get their clothes off?  I just want to see.  I want to see a fucking pussy and some tits and an ass, and then fucking get it over with  right away, and then we won't talk about it, you know?  Exactly, man.  Tomorrow we got events planned, which in my mind should just make it a comfortable party  atmosphere.  For them to take their clothes off.  And then they'll want to, you know, take their clothes off.  Do they have fucking hairy bushes?  I requested the hairiest bushes you could get. 
[03:27:00]  But Jesus!  Hair's coming back.  I said Ant has had a thing right now where he's looking for some red bushes.  I would like some red fucking fiery red bush down below.  Irish moss.  I want that fucking, yeah.  You know what Hookett's been saying to Nicole, speaking of bushes?  Yeah.  He said he wants to throw Nicole a baby shower.  Hell yeah.  But he let her know that in the black community, a baby shower means coming in a pregnant bitch.  Can't get it, bring it twice.  A baby shower. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, what the fuck?  I don't get it.  What's that?  Oh, we just got cummed on.  What happened?  What the fuck is that?  It looks like Jism.  I leaned on the Perel fucking handset.  Oh, I swear I thought Roland threw up on you or spit up like a baby.  I'm waiting for you because I can't go in there.  Oh, that's right.  He's getting my vehicle.  All right.  I got to go.  I don't care if he's telling you that I got on a Perel machine and I got fucking splooged on.  Yeah, okay.  What did that look like when all we came in here?  Blew like jizz in your world. 
[03:28:00]  Splooge.  I wouldn't come in here unless it did look like splooge.  It did look like splooge.  Splooge.  All right, guys.  Mission accomplished.  I'll be here tomorrow.  All right.  What time do you think you're going to come by tomorrow?  Who can?  I'll probably come.  I'll have to leave my house like six in the morning and I'll be here like eight.  You think it'll take you two hours to get it?  It's six in the morning.  There's no traffic.  Well, to avoid any kind of like fucking dumb white old lady crashing.  Like, you know, 280 West is a bunch of idiots.  White idiots.  Yeah, white idiots, of course.  And then one's crashing.  I don't see black people crashing. 
[03:28:30]  So I'll try to avoid that tomorrow.  And white people don't get, I mean, black people don't crash because they're too busy  getting pulled over.  Locked up.  They're causing traffic because they keep getting pulled over.  White people just smash into medians and stuff.  It's like, come on, man.  There was two accidents today.  Like, I left for, what, 830?  I got here at 10.  Jesus Christ.  And that's because all the roads are icy?  Yo, son, there was a brick of ice on my car.  The reason that in New York, because people go, you get two inches of snow and the whole 
[03:29:00]  city comes to a standstill and everybody goes, you know, oh, you guys are pussies in Rochester.  We get six inches of snow every day.  But the reason is, number one, nobody plows any roads here. </pre>
