<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment dedicated to listener calls and the hosts’ (Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton) scathing critiques of various disliked t-shirt designs and trends.  They mocked shirts featuring CBGB's, black dogs, Che Guevara, Von Dutch, "Sex Kitten" (especially on overweight women), Scarface (on Black people), and "Vote for Pedro," among others.  Listeners contributed their own examples, including Sean John, Echo Unlimited, "Independent" skateboard shirts, Hard Rock Cafe shirts, "Co-ed Naked Volleyball" shirts, and even one depicting JonBenét Ramsey with a murder-related slogan. The entire segment was rife with vulgar and offensive jokes and comments from both the hosts and callers.

Next, the show transitioned to a discussion of Pat O'Brien's recent interview on *The Insider*, focusing heavily on his on-air apology for alcoholism and alleged misconduct.  Audio clips from the interview were played, and the hosts, along with callers, mercilessly criticized Lara Spencer’s perceived soft questioning and O'Brien's perceived insincerity.  This segment too, featured numerous offensive jokes and comments about O'Brien and Spencer.

A chaotic mix of topics followed. It began with a discussion about a co-worker, Eric, his irritating Euro-dance ringtone, and his clumsy attempts at subtly communicating his phone number. This segued into Jimmy's bad mood due to a broken Dell laptop screen, leading to a comedic inventory of the cluttered items on his desk: a Pat Battle picture, a box of porn, and various novelty items.  A listener-sent talking fish was briefly examined and discarded.  A crude Jim Norton "Sensitivity Handbook" commercial was aired.

The show then welcomed studio guests Dennis Leary and Jim Gaffigan.  Their conversation ranged from their show business experiences (Leary's success with *Rescue Me*) to the differences between terrestrial and satellite radio, including censorship limitations, particularly concerning smoking on-air. The “wall of fame” discussion led to talk about Bobcat Goldthwait and Nikki Cox. They also discussed the BTK killer's confession tape. A caller shared a story about different types of vaginas, met with crude jokes and genuine curiosity from the hosts and guests.  The segment concluded with further discussion of *Rescue Me*, the NHL lockout, and the hosts' opinions on sports and celebrities.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing review of M. Night Shyamalan’s *The Village*, featuring Jim Gaffigan.  The hosts and Gaffigan relentlessly mocked the film’s acting (particularly Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix), plot, and twist ending, using highly offensive language.  Gaffigan shared acting anecdotes, including working with Clint Eastwood.  A caller defended the movie, but most other callers shared negative opinions. The latter half significantly featured a lengthy and sexually explicit interview with Paul Field and his wife, Denise, detailing their unconventional relationship that involved infidelity and began online.  The hosts reacted to and joked about their story throughout.  The segment included brief listener calls and an XM Radio advertisement.

A female caller then recounted her complicated romantic history, including simultaneous relationships with her current and former husband, sex while her current husband slept, hiding from her ex-husband (a Howard Stern fan) when picking up their children, and several extramarital affairs.  One affair involved a paralyzed woman she met online, described in graphic detail, and another involved forced oral sex on a famous British soap star in a restaurant bathroom.  She also detailed her mother's unconventional sex education methods using a banana. Her current husband, Paul, was in the studio and added details to her stories.  The hosts, Jimmy, and other callers actively engaged in the highly sexually explicit and vulgar conversation.

Finally, the show culminated in a segment focused on Paul and Denise performing oral sex on-air.  The hosts encouraged the act, initially suggesting it happen discreetly under the radio console, then under a large black sheet.  Multiple attempts were made, accompanied by comedic commentary and descriptions of the sheet's movements and Denise's reactions. The segment included sexually explicit descriptions of the act and other sexual experiences involving the couple, including a threesome, detailed in graphic accounts. The show concluded with a humorous recap of these events.

[00:04:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:04:30]  And, uh, accoutrements, callers give their examples of awful shirts in this segment called Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  No, we had some funny stuff about Juicy.  You think?  And the girls that wear Juicy and how un-Juicy they are.  I hope so.  I do too.  I do too.  I do too.  Juicy's are awful.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  It's a little stinky in here.  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Time just stinks.  Time just stinks.  Time just stinks. 
[00:05:00]  No one beats time.  What you do.  Time blows and wins in the end.  Which workbook?  We're going to the New York Post page 23.  CBGB's is closing, Anthony.  I care.  They're making a big deal about it here in New York because a lot of bands, of course,  got their start at CBGB's.  Not that big a deal though.  Doesn't matter what city you walk around in, that cool hip guy has to have his CBGB shirt  on. 
[00:05:30]  We get it.  We get it.  You're a rebel.  What a guy.  You're a rebel.  If it's 1977.  We should really start talking about the stupid t-shirts out there.  One of them is the CBGB shirts you see everywhere.  Yeah.  The other shirt you see everywhere is that dumb black dog.  Which one?  Black dog?  Yeah, black dog.  It's a t-shirt company in Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard. 
[00:06:00]  It's the black dog.  Someone help me here.  I'm the only one who's seen the black dog t-shirt.  I don't know that one.  Martha's Vineyard.  Thank you, Than.  Hi.  You haven't seen the black dog t-shirts?  They're everywhere too.  Well, I was only at the vineyard a month ago, so I don't...  No, it's not just a vineyard thing.  I guarantee we can walk around New York within a half hour, we'll see a black dog t-shirt.  Oh, t-shirt.  Yes.  The ones I hate the most are those fucking Shea Guevara shirts or whatever his name was.  Enough already.  Yeah, you don't like that?  Ah, I'm fucking right already with them. 
[00:06:30]  Everyone has one.  We know.  We know.  He was this.  He was a right.  I hate them.  I don't have Sabbath shirts.  And, of course, fat girls wearing the sexy shirts with cute little sayings.  Juicy.  Well, juicy comes to mind, but now there are just a million of them.  Yeah.  Hot stuff.  Really?  Sex kitten.  Sex kitten.  A fat girl should wear a shirt and it should be white in the front and black on the back  and it should have a blow hole in it. 
[00:07:00]  That's what every fat girl should be forced to wear.  Just walk around in flip-flops dress like a killer whale.  Or we throw fish at you, fat face.  I would prove you have a sense of humor.  Alright, moving on to other things.  Who hung up on you?  Well, we were talking about t-shirts and a guy was going to make a comment that a t-shirt  he's sick of is black people wearing the Scarface t-shirt.  Yeah.  That is a very popular one.  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie.  That's very, very popular these days.  So he had a great observation, but I guess he couldn't wait any longer. 
[00:07:30]  Those Von Dutch shirts made me want to bury an axe in someone's forehead, too.  Yeah, they're like trucker hats, but they're pink and lined green with Von Dutch on them  and they're like $100 a piece or something ridiculous.  And his shirt.  And Bob Kelly has a couple of them.  A stupid, you're not stylish.  Oh, no.  And his big, awful body is Von Dutch.  One word per side.  Let's say hi to Jim in Tennessee.  Hey.  What's up, Jim? 
[00:08:00]  Not too much.  One of the guys who went around wearing the independent t-shirts.  I never saw that.  What?  Independent.  Yeah, help us out.  The, uh, it's kind of this, it's just one word on a t-shirt that says independent.  Really?  I didn't see that one.  No.  Sorry.  I will say...  I'm just, hey, I'm sick of just shirts with sayings in general.  I saw one the other day.  I'm a talent coordinator.  Ugh.  That.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Kev's wearing an Echo Unlimited shirt, which I've never seen before, but I'm tired of Echo Unlimited as a brand. 
[00:08:30]  I'm tired of Sean John.  Yeah.  All that shit.  Enough already.  Put on a Kiss t-shirt, be a man already.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, what up, boy?  Hey.  Yeah, I just bought a t-shirt the other day.  It's the funniest thing.  It says 124 out of 125 teenagers say Viva Aruba.  Think about it for a second.  That's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  That's very funny.  That's funny.  Norton, suck this dick.  That is pretty funny, actually.  I like your shirt.  Why'd you have to make a hurtful comment?  Yeah, let's go to Chris.  Let's go to Chris.  Let's go to Chris.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris.  Yeah.  You can explain the independent shirts.  Go.  Yeah, I can.  It's a skateboard company.  Independent trucks.  I hope you should have known that.  And everybody just started wearing them to be posers.  You're at the skateboard shack.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  That's it.  Let's say hi to Matt in Boston.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, guys. 
[00:09:30]  I hate that Vote for Pedro shirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like people feel on each other and they can relate.  That was their losers and they hate this loser freaking movie.  See, the first time I saw a Vote for Pedro shirt, it made me laugh because I like Napoleon  Dynamite.  But you're right.  Now it's everywhere.  Hey, Jay.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Ovi.  Bill in Boston.  What's up?  Hey, how about those Hard Rock Cafe t-shirts?  Awful.  Yeah, terrible.  Hey, stay out of room 237. 
[00:10:00]  It's kind of cute, though, when it says Hard Rock Tokyo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You weren't there.  Shut up.  I'd like to know where they're from, though.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Hard Rock Vegas.  Shut up.  Shit up.  I was the worst with t-shirts years ago.  I'd get the t-shirts that would get, like, dated in two seconds.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Like, I was the one with the Ren and Stimpy shirt.  Oh, really?  And then, you know, a little wild lady, you put it on, you're like, no one's even watching 
[00:10:30]  Ren and Stimpy anymore.  The little stupid, like, sayings.  Where's the beef?  Oh.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  You did not.  I think I might have had that one.  You did not have that one.  Oh, what a tool.  To the worst tool.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  What an ass.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  I can't even look at him.  That's awful.  Yeah.  Man, I can't even look.  How hard is that?  I'm doing the rest of the show looking this way.  I'm sure that won't be a photo shot. 
[00:11:00]  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Holy.  Rambo is hot.  Lebanon was hot.  Holy shit.  A month later, you're an idiot.  Conglomerated mango shirt.  Well, we started a little something here.  Let's go to Joe in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Joe.  Yeah, I'm sick of Iron Crosses on shirts.  I'm a biker myself, but I'm sick of it.  Everybody's...  Oh, West Coast Chopper and...  Yeah, not just West Coast Chopper, but all bike companies are using it now. 
[00:11:30]  It's a little overplayed by...  Yeah, the Iron Cross.  Go with the swastika, I say.  That's what I'm talking about.  Let's pop that on a t-shirt.  You probably could correct.  Use the right thing.  You want to get attention.  Why are you putting things on your t-shirt?  To get attention.  So people look and go, oh, you get some kind of reaction.  They're wearing Harley shirts, too.  Put the old twisted cross on there.  I have a really...  Hey, Tim, you coming to Connecticut?  Nah, sir, not for a while.  I have a really cool shirt, actually.  It says, uh, co-ed naked volleyball. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, is that a scream?  Oh, the co-ed naked shirts.  I forgot about those.  Oh, they're fucking terrible.  And they have one for every sport.  And every one of them is fucking terrible.  Not funny.  You know what would be cool if it had a picture of JonBenet and it said, co-ed naked murdering.  Can you just say, repeat after me, say terrible two more times?  No.  Please.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible. 
[00:12:30]  No, say terrible.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  It's the terriblest!  Why can't you ever play along?  Terrible!  Because I know henchmen will do a little thing with the word terrible now.  Like you did with phenomenal.  Alright.  I'll do it.  Terrible!  Terrible!  There you go.  Thank you.  Alright, how about this shirt?  Let's say hi to Chris in Philly.  Go ahead, Chris.  Chris?  Hey. 
[00:13:00]  I was in the mall the other day.  I saw one of those trendy goops wearing a sex ed honor student t-shirt.  Oh, that's great.  He's getting his sexual education.  The no fear t-shirt.  Those are another old one.  Yeah.  Dude, when I see those on like those fucking annoying trucks down the shore with that little,  like the guy that looks like the Hawaiian punch guy hair on that no fear, I want a drunken  truck driver just to smash into them.  Or the other guy, the little cartoon guy pissing on the Ford emblem. 
[00:13:30]  Calvin.  Yeah, Calvin pissing on Ford.  Yeah, I'm a Chevy guy.  No fear.  Should after the drunk driving accident, it should be no movement below the neck.  Alright, Jesus.  Don't encourage him, angry little fella.  Go ahead, angry little fella.  Oh, what's up b-b-b-boys?  Hello.  Uh, you know what grinds my gears is when I see people wearing a misfit shirt with the  logo, we have no concept of the band or who they are. 
[00:14:00]  Absolutely right.  Whether they own an album or not.  Very good.  Bunch it up.  I hate when girls wear shirts that say porn star.  Yeah.  Because your cock teases, you're not porn stars.  Yeah.  They got all these 14 years old too.  Exactly.  Provocative t-shirts and they don't want you to comment on them.  Yeah, Hot Topic shirts.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  Good morning, b-b-b-boys.  Hi.  I saw a t-shirt on Sunday.  A guy was walking.  The t-shirt said, don't piss me off. 
[00:14:30]  I'm running out of places to bury the bodies.  I would just laugh.  And by the way, my wife wears one of those juicy shirts that says Hot Bottoms.  Hot Bottoms?  Yeah.  And how hot is her bottom, sir?  She's pretty good.  She's about 115, about 5'7".  Alright.  There you go.  There you go.  She's a hot bottom.  You know what shirt I really like?  I saw a pregnant woman with a shirt and right over the stomach it said, this is a fine 
[00:15:00]  place for a foot.  Alright, Roger in Mississippi.  Go ahead, Roger.  Who doesn't still laugh when you see I'm with stupid and the arrow and you're next to the  guy.  Come on now.  That's hysterical.  But the best one, I've got this one.  I actually have one black one and one white one.  It's his FBI female body inspector.  Oh, see?  Now that's funny.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  How about...  I'm doing Jimmy's video.  I'm not as sick as you drunk I am.  That's a great one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  I'll talk to you guys.  Punching out.  What is that other one about sex, being bad for your vision and all the letters are blurry  that say it and you look and go, whoa, I can't see.  Oh, I get it.  I have a cool one with just John Lennon wearing a New York City shirt.  That's great. 
[00:16:00]  That's a tribute.  Todd in North Carolina.  Hey, what do you say there, guys?  Hi.  Fluffy bottom.  Oh.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys sent a t-shirt hell or rotten cotton dot com and seen, uh,  I've got a, excuse the airplane, seen that one that says, uh, my Mexican works for less  money than your Mexican.  Ah.  Great.  Horrible shit.  Alright, sir.  Punching out.  Thank you.  Please.  Let's say hi to Ryder in Virginia.  Ryder?  Hey, guys. 
[00:16:30]  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  I got a shirt for you.  Alright.  It says, now hiring, apply below.  Now hiring, apply below.  Oh, apply below.  Got an arrow pointing down.  Gotcha.  Of course it does.  Very good.  It's the dick joke.  Alright, let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy?  Yeah.  Where's Woody's money, you faggot?  Oh.  I got confused.  I forgot to send it in.  I was compartmentalizing.  I was compartmentalizing.  And trying to shame mother.  Alright, sir. 
[00:17:00]  What?  Jeremy, go.  Hey, I wanted to say something to old Jimmy Norton there.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That Shamu comment, man.  Ah, you bill yourself as kind of the pervert's pervert.  You're into it.  Yeah, you guys were talking about t-shirts.  You were saying the fat chicks should have the white on the front, the black with the  blowhole on the back.  It wasn't Shamu.  Orca, or you know, In general.  Right. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, come on dude, that was just funny.  So what's up?  What's the point?  The pervert's pervert.  You know, you're into trannies and all this other fun crap.  I'm not at the tranny, sir.  You can't believe it.  Huh?  Go ahead.  Say what you're going to say.  There's a lot of us out there that are kind into the big women.  Now, I'm not talking, you know, Jabba, huge.  I'm not talking, you know, pick a roll and fuck it.  Chubby Chase.  Hey, when Jimmy said that comment about a shirt he wants to see,  were you in your car with your wife,  and now you feel like you have to call in and defend her? 
[00:18:00]  No, no.  I'm a trucker, man.  My wife's back in Missouri.  She doesn't have an XM.  She doesn't hear this shit.  It's not like I'm like, oh, hey, honey.  How much does your wife weigh, my friend?  How much does she weigh?  What does she tip the scales at?  And by that, I mean the scales you have to pull your truck on on the highway.  What does your wife weigh, sir, honestly?  Honestly, maybe 215.  Okay, so basically, I mean, I was just making a little bit of a weight joke,  but you got kind of mad because, you know, there's a fat pig at home. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  See?  You've always been into the fatties?  Oh, well, you know, I like big kicks.  I like a big ass.  It's just...  Sure.  How tall is she?  There's more there.  Like I said, you know, you're looking at it going,  which ones are the tits?  Because, oh, those are the ones with the nipples on it.  That's just nasty.  No, dude, how tall is the slob?  Um, oh, God, she's about 5'7". 
[00:19:00]  Okay, that's 5'5", and she's 230.  And how much did she weigh when you married the young lady?  Uh, she hasn't gained that much.  She gained about, uh, maybe 30 pounds.  That's a lot, bro.  Maybe a little bit more of it.  She lost a bunch, though.  How big did she actually get?  How big she actually gets?  Yeah, like you said she lost a bunch.  When you've lost a bunch and you're down to 215, you were at one point, you were almost killable.  She, um, she was just under 200 when I married her. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  What did you like about her when you first saw her?  She got up to maybe 245, maybe 250 right in there.  Yeah.  What did you like about her when you first met her?  She was smart, had a real pretty face.  Uh, to be brutally honest, she had a great set of sets.  Um, that was a...  Wait, so you said she was...  Sorry, when she was brutally honest,  Did every time she take a bite, did she go, 
[00:20:00]  Go away, bad childhood.  Go away, bad childhood.  No.  Uh...  I'm supposed to get the fist off one here, and I'm laughing.  No, um...  Really, um, she did not get big.  Um, until she married her first husband.  Ah.  It was, uh, it was, uh, you know, she couldn't get out of it.  It was an abusive relationship.  What would he do?  Put donuts on his fist?  And punch her in the mouth?  Um...  No, it was abusive. 
[00:20:30]  But, um, it was kind of a psychological thing, you know, she felt that she made herself big,  That she'd be undesirable to him, and he'd leave her.  Oh, that's the strategy.  She gets fat, the husband goes, Oh, I'm leaving.  But...  Yeah.  And she ended up leaving him anyway, it was, you know, it didn't work.  But the big deal is, you know, Jim's a freak, as far as all the different fun things he's into. 
[00:21:00]  There's somebody out there for him.  There's somebody that's gonna say, My God, you're perfect, you know, because of all the fun things you're into.  I looked at my wife and said, Damn, I gotta have it.  Yeah.  Did you date a lot growing up?  What's that?  Did you date a lot of girls growing up?  Are you a big fella yourself?  Um, I'm a truck driver.  I've got the standard trucker gut anymore, a little bit.  Uh, but, uh, yeah, I did it quite, uh, I wouldn't say, you know, thought and wanted, but, uh, I did it a huge one out. 
[00:21:30]  How old were you when you got married, sir?  Sir, how old were you?  Twenty-one.  Oh, twenty-one.  Twenty-one.  You were young.  Yep.  Yeah.  I see a lot of problems.  Yeah, this is brutal.  This is troubled.  Did you knock her up or something?  No.  Um, she actually...  Did you think she was already knocked up?  Twenty-one sons to begin with.  What?  She came with twenty-five-year-old sons to begin with. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  So you, uh, you got an instant family at twenty-one years old?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She was 195 with two kids?  How many guys did you have to fight off?  Um, well, there was a little bit of competition there, but, uh...  Was there a bunch of...  Dude, was there a big, like, hanging bunt with stretch marks on it?  No.  No, man.  That would be in the java category.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, 195 is a big gal. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, not to tease her, but that's a hefty gal.  You know, that's a big girl.  You're just into the...  Yeah.  You're just into the bigger girls.  I mean, there's plenty of you out there.  It's fine.  Chubby chaser.  Dude, absolutely...  Look, we all love our mommies, and none of us want mommy to leave, and a lot of times,  you know, we find somebody who won't leave us.  That's very understandable.  Right.  With a matronly figure.  My mom was a real little gal.  No, no, no.  It's not about the figure, sir.  It's about the idea of a mommy.  It's about not wanting to be left or abandoned or left alone. 
[00:23:00]  So you get somebody who will depend on us and not leave us.  You know, be a big fatso with two kids.  I mean, no disrespect.  I'm not speaking ill of your wife.  I'm sure she's lovely.  She sure isn't going anywhere, though.  Absolutely not.  Especially the stairs involved.  What kind of childhood did you have?  Me?  Yeah.  Incredibly happy.  In fact, my wife and in-laws refer to my folks as the Cleavers.  Really?  Well, that's got to be a lot of fun.  What do they call her, Mr. Ed? 
[00:23:30]  All right, sir.  Wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  All right.  Are we done with Jeremy?  Yeah, he is all right.  All right.  Oh, I wanted to know if it was the Cleavers or the friend on the show, Lumpy.  Brian from Austin.  Brian.  Where did you meet, Miss Arbuckle? 
[00:24:00]  To kick him at his fat wife right down the steps.  Good karate kick of the spine.  Take that with some hot soup in your hand.  Nothing is more important than the simple act of people getting together.  Good.  Could I have one more go, Lawson, please?  Sorry.  What?  Could I have just one more take of that?  Why?  I just did it right.  Yeah.  Look, I'm not used to having more than one person in there.  One more word out of you and you go.  Is that clear? 
[00:24:30]  Yes, sir.  I take directions from one person under protest.  But from two, I don't sit still.  Who the hell are you, anyway?  No, I'm the engineer.  Well, why the hell are you asking me for another one?  Well, I thought there was a slight bonk and I would just like to be safe.  Jesus.  What is a gonk?  Do you mind telling me what that is?  No, a bang from outside.  Can I see Mrs. Rogers for a minute, please? 
[00:25:00]  Yes, certainly.  Bear, do you really mean that?  Yeah, so in other words, I'd start half a second later.  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  If you can make it almost when that shell disappears, it'll make my...  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field and say every July, peas grow there. 
[00:25:30]  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire where Mrs. Buckley lives.  Every July, peas grow there.  We're out even in the fields, you see?  Yeah, we are.  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them.  Yeah.  On what?  On in July.  I don't understand you then.  When must...  What must be over for July?  When we get out of that snowy field.  Well, I was out.  We were onto a can of peas, a big dish of peas when I said in July. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.  Yes, always.  I'm always past that.  You are?  Yes.  Well, that's about where I say in July.  Can you emphasize a bit in?  In July.  Why?  That doesn't make any sense.  Sorry.  There's no known way of saying an English sentence in which you begin a sentence with in and emphasize it.  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July and I'll go down on you.  That's just idiotic if you'll forgive me if I say so. 
[00:26:30]  That's just stupid.  In July.  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July.  Impossible.  Meaningless.  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to.  He isn't thinking.  Well, sir, can we just do one last...  Yeah?  And it was my fault I said in July, if you can leave every July.  You didn't say it.  He said it.  Your friend.  Every July?  No, you don't really mean every July.  But that's a bad copy.  It's in July. 
[00:27:00]  No, you know, of course it's every July.  There's too much directing around here.  Norway.  Fish fingers in Norway.  Findus, Norway.  We know a certain fjord in Norway.  Near where the cod gather in great shoals.  There, Janster Stangeland.  Shit.  A fraction more on that shoals thing.  Because you roll it around very nicely.  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time.  You don't know what I'm up against.  Because it's full of things that are only correct because they're grammatical.  But they're tough on the air. 
[00:27:30]  You see?  This is a very wearying one.  It's unpleasant to read.  Unrewarding.  Because Findus frees the cod at sea and then add a crumb crisp, crumb crisp coating.  That's tough, crumb crisp coating.  I think, no, because of the way it's written, you need to break it up.  Because it's not as conversationally written.  What?  Take crumb out.  Take crumb out.  Good. 
[00:28:00]  Here under protest is beef burgers.  We know a little place in the American Far West  where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef and tastes.  This is a lot of shit.  You know that.  You want one more?  More on what beef?  You missed the first beef, actually, completely.  What do you mean missed it?  You're emphasizing prairie-fed.  But you can't emphasize beef.  That's like he's wanting me to emphasize in before July. 
[00:28:30]  Come on, fellas.  You're losing your heads.  I wouldn't direct any living actor like this in Shakespeare.  Will you do this?  It's impossible.  Orson, you did six last year and by far and away the best.  And I know the reason.  The right reading for this is the one I'm giving you.  At the moment.  I spend 20 times more for you people than any other commercial I've ever made.  You are such pests.  Now, what is it you want?  Nothing.  In your depths of your ignorance.  What is it you want?  Whatever it is you want, I can't deliver because I just don't see it. 
[00:29:00]  That was absolutely fine.  It really was.  You didn't want it.  No money is worthless.  I just ate four burritos and drank a pot of coffee.  Anyone for trouser chili?  Oh, God damn.  Oh, God damn.  The OPN Anthony Show.  Oh, God.  XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show.  All right, we've got to put the Pat O'Brien thing to bed, Anthony.  Yes.  Pat O'Brien was on the Dr. Phil afternoon show. 
[00:29:30]  Do you want to hear a little of that or do you want to go right to what he said on his show, The Insider?  I'm done with him and Dr. Phil.  Yeah?  There's really nothing more that he's going to add to any of this.  I want to hear what he said on The Insider.  All right, yeah.  Well, he was finally back on his own program.  And it was last night on The Insider.  In case you missed it, here it is.  As promised, I have something to say to all of you, the Insider viewers, in just a moment.  First, is Larry Spencer has something to say.  Oh, the big tease. 
[00:30:00]  He's teasing with his own little tragedy.  And it's a tease.  The big tease.  I bet you they finally had him say what he had to say at the end of the show, right?  Mm-hmm.  So you have to sit through all that crap.  Oh, at the end of the show.  That's what I'm assuming.  That's right.  Not only did Pat face Dr. Phil, he had to face some pretty tough questions from me as well.  That's right.  Oh, no.  Pat had to face some pretty tough questions from me.  Ugh.  Did this whore actually get in the mix?  Yeah, they had to make it.  Well, it's, you know the other shows were probably doing stories on Pat. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  So why should the Insider be left out?  He left out.  Right.  Well, Larry Spencer doesn't, there's nothing tough about her.  Pat, would you have licked ass?  Would you really have let Betsy eat her pussy?  Well, let's see how tough the questions are, Anthony.  I know I can't drink again, because when I drink, I know on the other side of that door is hell.  In our sobering sit-down, nothing was off limits.  Let me ask you this. 
[00:31:00]  Have I ever seen you sober?  Were you drinking every day?  No, not during the day.  Never miss a day at work.  Never miss an hour at work.  Never miss a minute at work.  That's the tough question?  Are you drunk right now?  What's the tough question?  The question everyone wants to know is if he had that threesome.  Did he hook up?  What is Betsy thinking and feeling these days?  How did that night end?  Who is the name of this woman?  How did that night end?  Nothing's off limits.  This is Lara Spencer, I guarantee knows the girl that was being harassed.  Yep.  This bitch stinks. 
[00:31:30]  Did you ever drunk drive a spaceship?  What awful softball she's loving.  Did I ever see you sober?  Are you kidding me?  You stink, Lara.  Even Tippi Tom is sober, you know.  Sure he is.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Once.  But I drank at night.  I know it got a little bit tough and he was not holding back any of his questions.  Was there a moment where you said, I'm out of here?  I'm walking.  No.  Those days are over for me.  Whoa.  Dude, she's going into some weird territory here. 
[00:32:00]  That was a tough interview where you attempted to walk out in the middle.  Wow.  That's a tough question when you'll actually ask about someone else who has tough questions.  I hope she's fucking putting a wood chipper by a lake.  You stink, Lara.  She really needs to be back on News 12 doing stupid reports from the side of the LIE.  Yep.  That's where she began.  Lara Spencer.  Ugh.  Days are over for me.  I had to own up to some really bad behavior, which I was happy to do.  But humbling it has been. 
[00:32:30]  I'm totally humble.  Look, I was 40 days in rehab.  I was on kitchen and toilet duty for the entire time.  The latest headline in this week's People magazine says it all.  Pat allowed the magazine's cameras inside his Hollywood Hills home to get a glimpse at what has become his private inner sanctuary.  In the article, which hits newsstands tomorrow, longtime friend Michael J. Fox talks about Pat saying, quote,  There's a lot of spelling mistakes in that one. 
[00:33:00]  How the hell can you read the statement?  Jesus, I hope he dictated.  I'll type it myself.  Michael J. Fox is a longtime friend of Pat O'Brien's?  Apparently so.  Who knew?  Who knew?  There's some wacky Hollywood friendships out there.  We learn something every day on this show, huh?  I just want to suck your...  I want you to lick Betsy's ass while your hand shakes and you spill coffee all over yourself.  Tomorrow, longtime friend Michael J. Fox talks about Pat saying, quote,  It was something he thought he might need to get a handle on, but each person has to find their own bottle. 
[00:33:30]  Now, if this wasn't Pat O'Brien that this happened to, what would your headline for it be?  Well, that wasn't the Pat O'Brien you know.  That was Pat O'Brien fueled on Alpha Phi.  My headline would be...  Hopefully my headline's going to be Pat O'Brien gets second chance.  That's the headline I want.  As embarrassing as this ordeal has been for Pat, he told me he's...  I mean, she asked, what would the headline be?  And she's talking about on the show. 
[00:34:00]  An honest answer would have been,  Insider host drunk sex crazed night of perverse phone calls and cocaine.  What was his answer?  Well, I hope it would be Pat O'Brien gets a second chance.  Yeah, that's what the host of one of these rag tabloid shows would put forth as their headline.  No, the headline is,  Stay tuned for our recordings of a sex crazed addict on the loose on the town. 
[00:34:30]  That's what she was asking for.  This guy is so...  He's a liar.  He has not recovered from anything.  He's not being honest.  She's worse than he is, though.  Because at least he's got to say that.  I mean, if I was him, I'd try to weasel out of it, too.  I think it would have been very funny and sincere  if he would have come up with some kind of sensational headline for his story.  You know, that would have been more honest and more...  You know, you'd have thought, wow, that's cool. 
[00:35:00]  He's kind of got a sense of humor about it.  He's being honest about it.  But no, second chance.  Okay, it's a host of another show.  Pat O'Brien sitting in the seat he's sitting in now,  not having gone through what he went through.  Another host from another tabloid show did exactly what he did.  Pat's going to sit there and go, let me write the headline for this.  I hope he gets a second chance.  No!  No!  Deadline line.  As embarrassing as this ordeal has been for Pat,  he told me he is so grateful for sobriety 
[00:35:30]  and all the support, especially from his son, Sean.  My greatest moment in all this was when he put his arm around me  in front of a whole group of people and he said,  I'm here to support my dad.  And to be in rehab and have him put his arm around and said,  this is my dad, I'm here to support him.  It's amazing.  Oh, boy.  What's amazing about it?  What's amazing about it, Lara?  Amazing.  Holy shit, is she a fraud?  And she's like, nothing was off limits. 
[00:36:00]  We heard nothing there.  Absolutely nothing.  Ass suck cock from whackbag.com.  That's got to be a fake screen name.  It might be.  Michael J. Fox met Pat O'Brien in the alternative future  when Pat stole the Gracie's World Almanac  and gave it to himself and bought Pussy and Coke with it.  I didn't even know that, but apparently that's how they met.  That's how they met.  All right.  Well.  Wow. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, here's Pat signing off on the Insider  with finally what he needed to tell everybody.  Dude, her questions are pretty tough, though, man.  I've got to be honest.  They are hard-hitting.  She said, like, what would the headlines be?  I mean, there's not a lot of room to maneuver there.  She was right.  Nothing was off limits at all.  Got a lot of unanswered questions there.  Woof.  I feel bad for wishing ovarian cancer on her.  Pat, thank you so much for your honesty  in answering my questions.  You know we all welcome you back and support you. 
[00:37:00]  Nothing.  What did Hawk just do?  What did Hawk just do with our nude pictures  and semi-nude pictures?  He looked at them all up and looked under them.  No, they were taped up the other way  so you couldn't see them.  So George Foreman wouldn't see naked bodies.  In case Foreman came in.  No, no, that was smart move.  Is that why the only sign that's showing is  where's Chester and Don't More and Donkey Sausage  instead of shit dick?  It was Jimmy's request 
[00:37:30]  because he didn't want to blow his photo off.  No, no, no, no.  You might have got him in.  If he came in...  The dildo is gone off of the shelf.  Dude, but if he came in  and then saw that stuff,  that's good radio.  No, he might have just walked out, though,  or said one thing.  You never know.  His guy might have come in even.  His guy might have come in  and looked around and said,  well, you never know.  It was worth the chance.  He's forming.  I hear you.  So it was a good move.  All right.  Ryan from Minnesota.  Actually, let's let him say it.  This does say it all.  Ryan, go ahead.  Hey, you know, pal, Brian,  he's not sorry that 
[00:38:00]  he was doing that stuff.  He's sorry he got caught.  Of course he's sorry he got caught.  He was having fun.  Well, perhaps you didn't hear  the interview he did with Lara, sir.  Perhaps you didn't just hear  the tough questions  that this guy just fielded.  And a lot of people,  Wayne from Canada,  thinks Pat will hit the bottle again.  Yeah, what does Wayne know?  He's listening illegally.  Wayne's a thief and a liar.  So good to be back, Lara.  Thank you.  And now I'd like to say something  to you guys at home.  Uh-oh.  I'm Pat O'Brien 
[00:38:30]  and I'm an alcoholic.  For the past 50...  Damn it, where's my laugh  when I need it?  Pat, thank you so much  for your honesty  and answering my questions.  You know we all welcome you back  and support you.  It's so good to be back, Lara.  Thank you.  And now I'd like to say something  to you guys at home.  I'm Pat O'Brien  and I'm an alcoholic.  In the past 50 days,  I've been on a journey  that has been nightmarish  yet challenging  and indeed fulfilling.  I checked myself  into an alcohol rehabilitation center 
[00:39:00]  in mid-March  for a problem  I had been in denial over.  For you loyal viewers,  not for a second  did I ever appear  on this program  where others  under the influence  and that's the way  it will be moving forward.  You should know  that in the end,  I don't work for Paramount  or for our parent company,  Viacom.  I work for you,  the person holding  the remote control.  It is you  who I'm indebted to  and it is for you  that I will continue  to bring you the news here  with integrity,  fairness,  and a sense of luck  that I get to do it  in the first place. 
[00:39:30]  With all that has gone on,  I live by the following.  God grant me the serenity  to accept the things  I cannot change,  the courage to change  the things I can  and the wisdom  to know the difference.  Make that up?  With that,  we'll be back in a moment.  This?  Jimmy is ready to throw himself  out the window.  I understand he's doing  damage control.  First of all,  Opie and Anthony  worked for the people too  and Viacom still found  a way to fuck them.  However,  they didn't fuck you.  I don't work for Paramount  or Viacom. 
[00:40:00]  I work for you,  the people holding  the remote control.  No, you don't.  We said something similar  and we were still  showing the dick.  Maybe he shouldn't say it.  Maybe Dana McClintock  should fucking come out  and say it again.  Just a spokesman asshole.  My name is Pat O'Brien  and I'm an alcoholic.  We all know  that there are certain  12-step meetings  that open like that  and close with a serenity prayer,  you melodramatic fool.  My name is Pat O'Brien  and I like to lick ass.  That's right.  How about the sex addiction?  Why do you want to be honest? 
[00:40:30]  Let's address that.  Yeah.  I'm a sex addict as well.  My name's Pat O'Brien  and I like to drink  on Sundays.  I'm an alcoholic.  My name is Pat O'Brien  and my girlfriend Betsy  is quite the bag licker.  I don't work for Paramount  or Viacom.  I work for Jack Daniels.  I don't work for Sprint  or Verizon  or any other cell phone.  Oh boy. 
[00:41:00]  My name is Pat O'Brien.  And that serenity prayer,  I'll say one thing though,  but that was a really sincere rendition  of the serenity prayer.  That was really cool.  You know it was just  rolling on that teleprompter.  Just those words  rolling by his eyes  on the teleprompter.  Just like Britney Spears  pregnant  will give you  a behind the scenes look  at her life  now that  blah, blah, blah.  I'm sexy.  I don't want to  fucking go crazy  with you.  I don't want to 
[00:41:30]  fucking go crazy  with you.  I don't want to  do.  Oh my God.  I want to fuck you.  You're a fucking mom.  I have a cell phone  in here.  I don't want to  want to meet  her daddy.  I don't want to  meet her daddy.  But don't you love  her face.  I don't want to  see your face.  Don't you love  her as she's 
[00:42:00]  walking out  the door.  But yes,  yes, that's  yet.  I'll bet  that you answer her.  Like she did  one thousand  times before.  I don't do this  for a reason.  It's quite new to me.  Don't you love  her ways.  Tell me what  you say.  I'm not  good at you.  Don't you love  her as she's  walking out  the door.  You have no  more messages.  That's not bad.  Do you know what  the beauty is?  That he's just  trying to move 
[00:42:30]  on and most of  radio can't really  play it and yet  on this show,  not only are we  not letting him  move on,  we are incessantly  replaying it  uncensored.  It's filthy.  Replaying it  over and over  again.  Every time  some fucking  pest psychopath  puts it with a  song,  right onto the  show it comes.  Of course.  This has a little  more shelf life  in it.  How funny is it  when you see  these message  board guys  going to other  message boards  and just throwing  in these little  Pat O'Brien  things that  aren't dirty  enough to get  them in trouble? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Those rights  have to go,  if you agree  with me,  just say yes.  Just say yes.  That was Mr.  Sinister from  PopeBag.com  it looks like.  I want to give  him credit for that.  I smell relapse  with Pat O'Brien.  Of course.  Sean from  Jersey.  Yeah.  40 days too  is nothing  obviously,  right Jimmy?  I mean.  50 days,  it's a great  start but it's  like you can't  go around  tooting your  own horn like  you're cured  after that.  It's like,  you know.  The battle  has just begun. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah,  it's a lifelong  thing.  Alright,  let's go to  Sean.  Sean?  Yeah,  how you doing  guys?  Hey.  I just wanted  to say how  fucked up it  was that he  wanted to be  so sincere and  ask for  everybody's  forgiveness and  he didn't even  use his real  voice.  They still  had to have  that insider  voice.  I'm Pat O'Brien.  God grant me  the serenity.  The serenity.  And I want to  beat off on  your face.  Yeah,  I have one more  thing to say  though.  Yeah.  Yeah,  Jimmy,  you used to go  to Frank's in  Manville?  Frank's Chicken 
[00:44:00]  House?  Yeah,  it's not there  anymore.  I went there  like three or  four times to  see porn stars  dance.  Yeah,  that's right.  It's right  across the street  from my church.  Oh,  okay,  I don't even  remember where  it was.  I just remember  like I was  19,  20,  15 years ago.  And we  care why?  I don't know.  I heard him  talking about it  two days ago.  Alright,  I'm punching  out.  No,  don't,  sir.  We want to  talk more  about Frank's.  Let's go  to Jerry.  Jerry,  what's up?  Yeah,  you know,  first thing  he did 
[00:44:30]  is said,  I'm Brad  O'Brien,  that's not  anonymous.  You know,  this fucking  idiot isn't  going to  make it  two months.  I got to  disagree with  you on one  thing.  Go for it.  Only because  anonymity  in relation  to certain  programs.  He didn't  break his  anonymity as  far as saying  he's a member  of any  particular group.  To acknowledge  you're an  alcoholic publicly  to me is  acceptable as  long as you  don't associate  yourself with  any group that  requests you  maintain a level  of public  anonymity.  There's so  many groups  out there.  Society?  Read the  traditions, 
[00:45:00]  Jimmy.  Read the  traditions.  I am  completely  You're  suffering from  cranial  rectumitis  here.  No,  I'm not.  Read the  traditions.  Hey,  stupid.  Bill Wilson  went to  Rockefeller  and asked  for money.  He went  and asked  for public  funds.  He admitted  he was an  alcoholic publicly.  It wasn't  a secret.  Bill Wilson  didn't...  This guy's  a carrier of  alcoholism.  You want to  drink at the  talk.  Dude,  as long as  you don't  associate  yourself with 
[00:45:30]  any particular  12-step program.  I already hung  up.  You can admit  your own  personal thing.  I'm an  alcoholic.  I'm Jim  Norton.  I'm an  alcoholic.  That's not  an anonymity  break,  stupid.  Hold on.  I've read the  tradition.  That's why I  don't say  where I go.  That's why I  wear a mask.  I wear a  superhero mask  wherever I am.  I've got to  jump in again.  Mr. Sinister  is giving us  an instant  feedback here  saying,  from Whackbag,  who is  Popebag?  It was in his  email.  What?  It was in his  email.  You guys did a  joke about  Whackbag being  Popebag when  the Pope was  coming around.  He put it as a 
[00:46:00]  joke in his  email, so that's  what I wrote on.  Put it as a joke  and that's what's  going to be written  on there, you  asshead.  Why is everyone  uptight?  We don't know.  Mr. Sinister  indeed.  Let's all get  naked and hug  in the woods.  Let's start in  the studio at  1101.  Just saying,  get used to it.  Throw some  leaves down.  Let's go to  Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jimmy, you  luscious ball of  yum-yums.  Thank you.  Hey, I agree.  This guy's going  to relapse.  Even Michael J.  Fox has said  that his chances 
[00:46:30]  of recovery are  shaky.  Punching out.  All right, a  little shaky.  That's not entirely  bad.  You want to  cricket him,  but it was  mean, and that  kind of gives  it a little  life.  I actually  pushed the  cricket button  down halfway,  but I couldn't  commit.  I'm like,  it's right on  the line there.  Not too bad.  All right.  Let's try this  thing out here.  Hey, it's me.  What's up,  guy?  You are so  fucking hot.  Who, me?  I don't want  to be you. 
[00:47:00]  I know.  I heard the  conversation.  I don't want  to suck my  God.  I don't want  to fuck you.  I think  everyone should  be out.  I don't want  to go.  Yeah.  It's so  fucking hot.  You're  fucking hot.  Why are we  even talking  about the  P-word?  I don't want  to fuck you.  Go crazy  with you.  I got to go,  guys.  Yeah.  I don't want  to fuck you.  Go crazy  with you.  Guys, I don't  do that.  That's not my  style, okay?  I don't do  that crap.  That's why 
[00:47:30]  I just hung  up the  phone.  I was  like, you  know what?  I got  to go.  It's not  my style.  I did  maybe your  style, but  it ain't  mine.  You call  me a  pussy, I'm  hanging  up.  You're  pussy.  That was  funny.  Hey, that  had potential.  Tommy Lee  called.  That had  potential.  It picked  up at the  end.  It was a  little slow  call.  Go crazy.  Go.  Go.  Go.  That had  potential,  no?  You all  right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm 
[00:48:00]  really annoyed  at that  last call.  I know.  There's  nothing that  annoys me  more than  somebody  pontificating  when you're  wrong.  I don't  do it  all the  time.  Anthony,  let's  calm on  Jimmy.  Calm on.  Hey, man,  as long as  you can  smile.  He's smiling  now.  That guy's  heart's in  the right  place.  That's  all that  matters.  There  you go.  Jimmy's  back.  I have  Liddy.  That's  all I  need.  Look,  more.  How can  you be  when  George O'Dowd  is  out of  tune?  Dee,  dee, 
[00:48:30]  dee.  La,  la,  la.  Ba,  ba,  ba.  There we  are.  Feeling  better?  We  couldn't.  How do  you not  feel  good  with  this?  You  gotta  let  the,  what's  you  called?  The  hook?  Yeah,  yeah.  The  hook.  Everybody.  Feel  better.  Ba-da!  Come,  come,  come,  come,  come,  come,  come on my face.  You come and  go. 
[00:49:00]  You come and  go.  All right,  he's  back.  Pretending I  was a  UN interpreter.  Good Lord.  There he is.  And Kelsey  Tower falling  down makes  everybody smile.  See,  Jimmy's laughing  again.  How can  you not  be?  A little,  uh,  Pat O'Brien's  a good  sort.  Ah,  God bless  him.  Anonymity,  shmamanimity.  All right,  that Tommy Lee  thing was from  DJ New Style.  It was pretty  good.  Scout from  Tennessee.  Hey,  I was  wondering,  that song  you were  playing,  what was  the name  of that?  Is that  Comma Comedian? 
[00:49:30]  Wait,  it's coming.  Pretending I  was a UN  interpreter.  Good Lord.  That's right.  Comma Comedian.  Maybe we just  get the clip.  Comma,  Comma Comedian.  That could be the  new sound clip when  someone bombs,  just the good  Lord part in the  fall.  The fall.  Good Lord.  Good Lord.  All right,  you want to try  this Trainables  Pedal Bride thing?  I haven't heard  this one.  It could be  very wrong.  Could be good,  could be bad.  I like it.  Daddy?  Daddy?  Daddy?  You're so 
[00:50:00]  fucking hot.  Okay.  I don't want you  to suck my god.  It's sticky,  all right.  I want to fuck  it.  All right,  Jesus,  we made this one.  How old is that  Trainable?  Like 12.  I got to get a  bail on that one.  Holy shit.  I can't even go  with that one.  But it's from the  50s.  She's old now.  Good point,  Ant.  Good point.  There's no real  connection.  It's very funny.  Wait a look at it.  It's sticky. 
[00:50:30]  Oh my god.  Oh,  well,  that's the  bit stopper  right there.  Oof.  The OPN Anthony  Show.  Little Jimmy  Norton's desk.  I have a very  cluttered desk.  Remember we went  through that list  of everything on it,  including some  singing fish?  Including a  single fish.  Some single fish.  A single fish.  And a married  lobster.  I was ready to  call you out on  your awful reading  and I fucked it up.  That's right.  A single fish. 
[00:51:00]  Including a  singing fish.  Yeah.  Yes.  And I did  something with  the singing fish,  I guess.  Don't ruin it.  That's right.  That's a big tease.  And no one will  guess what you did  with the singing fish.  Hung it on  his wall proudly.  A duet.  I held it gently.  It's the worst  of Opie and Anthony.  By the way,  Jimmy, you calm?  Yeah, I was really hot.  During the break,  you broke your computer  or something.  That's why Steve  is in the studio  because he witnessed  this thing.  I broke the mouse.  Shortest fuse ever. 
[00:51:30]  I've never seen  somebody get that  pissed off that quickly.  First of all,  there's junk on my desk  that isn't mine.  I know it's a desk,  you gotta put stuff on it,  but all this shit  that winds up on it,  and I know other guys  gotta use the computer.  Do we got a list  that's not yours?  You're claiming  this stuff isn't yours?  We got a list  of the stuff  on Jim's desk.  Okay.  Where's Ben?  Because, you know,  Ben, obviously,  the telemaker's on here.  He's right now  highlighting things  and just scrolling  through the page  for no reason.  I love that Norton  pointed out that Ben  just laughs  when you're pissed off  because I watched  it go down.  You come in here 
[00:52:00]  raging about the computer.  I guess someone  signed on  and just messed it up  so you can log on  or whatever,  and you're trying  to explain this to Ben,  and Ben's reaction  is just to laugh  openly at you.  That was so funny.  My anger came from  the fact,  of course,  I expect guys  to use a computer.  I don't own it.  But when you do,  it's like,  just put my username back  because it's like  Jay Norton.  I don't remember  if it's Jim Norton,  Jay Norton,  and I got like a minute  to go back there.  I don't feel like  fucking around  and going through  all the names  of what my username is.  I remember my password.  Click and have it come up.  The last person  that used the computer,  I think,  was Opie on Friday. 
[00:52:30]  No, I didn't get on,  though, I don't think.  No, you didn't get on  the computer on Friday?  No, because we couldn't  figure out his log on.  And also,  I just had problems  because my laptop  is fucked up  and I'm just cranky  with the whole technology thing.  I hate it, dude.  I hate it.  But you spiked the mouse  into the desk.  I don't have a mouse.  Good.  So he's trying to log in  and then just takes the mouse.  It's one of those  wireless ones?  Yeah, it's one of those  battery-perved ones.  Yeah, which are really heavy  because the batteries  are in there  and then just smashes  it on the desk.  Jimmy.  Dude, you don't know  how close I've come 
[00:53:00]  to putting my fist  at home through  my laptop screen.  I don't do it.  Yeah.  Or through my desktop screen.  I almost...  Hold on.  Let me explain to Steve.  I never heard  of vibrate Carlisi.  Sorry.  Jesus.  What's the matter?  Wasn't there a gay song  you could put on?  Nice ring.  Yeah.  Well, it was  the Beverly Hills cop theme.  I changed it.  Okay.  The 1936 bell telephone ring.  Jesus.  I'm being handed a note  that Danny has  take on me  as his ringtone?  Yeah, it's awful. 
[00:53:30]  Holy crap.  Well, Eric just sold him  down the river.  What do you have  on yours, Eric?  Yeah, Eric's is pretty bad.  Yeah, Eric's is pretty bad.  He wants to sell  Danny down the river.  What is Eric's?  That same one  that you heard last time.  Let me dial it.  What was it?  Hold on.  I'm going to call up  Hawk.  Hawk, get your phone  by the microphone.  Nope, I changed it.  You're right.  I want to hear it anyway.  I'm sure it's awful.  It probably is.  That's my mic technique.  I've been working on that.  Very good.  Excellent.  It's been, uh,  Eric, 718.  Okay.  There we go. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, there's the sound.  Yep.  Put it up by the mic.  Nothing?  It's ringing.  Oh, oh, it's vibrating.  Called the wrong one.  Which one is that?  That's my personal phone.  Well, of course  your personal phone.  That's nothing.  You may just do this bit  knowing you have  a boring ring?  Holy crap.  And you have it  on a vibrate?  No, that's just  the regular ring.  But what's the other 
[00:54:30]  phone you have?  That's the work phone.  Oh, I didn't know  the work phone.  And is that the one  with the fagging?  Not that anybody  could hear any of this  because Eric  isn't talking on a mic.  Yeah, Eric,  no one can hear you.  What do you want to do this?  Why would you let him  call your number?  Hey, Karnak.  Good job, E-Rock.  Karnak, why don't you  just do this?  Just think it  and people will know.  Jesus.  He just kind of whispers.  Eric, mouth out  mouth out the number.  I didn't even have  that one.  He might have assumed  I had that one.  You do realize  when you do radio  you're looking  for a payoff, right?  Oh, my God. 
[00:55:00]  He's just wasting...  What?  He's answering it.  There we go.  There, I'll give him  the number.  What?  Oh, so we can  waste another  two minutes on this?  Eric, this was  a quick throwaway.  Sweetie, mouth it to me.  Oh.  Holy shit, you're kidding me.  That's like so bad.  Was that the bad  90s dance song?  When you answer,  did it say,  hello, this is  Tommy Morrison's  blood calling?  How is that?  I don't even know  the song.  You don't have to. 
[00:55:30]  Thank God you don't.  What is it?  The Euro dance song.  Ugh.  Why is that  your ringtone?  So it wakes me up  in the morning.  You had to make  a conscious decision  to put that in  as your ringtone.  You know what  wakes me up  in the morning?  I got a Bose radio  and fucking Blizzard  of Oz is in there  and I Don't Know starts  and you jump out  of bed  when that shit  fucking cranks.  Right.  That.  That's a great visual.  You want to wake up  fucking Ozzy Osbourne  is the first thing  I hear  and it never even  gets to the lyrics.  So Jimmy destroyed 
[00:56:00]  his mouse  is what we're getting at  and then he tried  to explain it to Ben  and Ben just started  laughing uncontrollably  and hackling.  Because I wouldn't,  you know,  there's nothing,  Jim is always in a bad mood.  You're never happy.  That's not true.  You're never happy.  That's not true.  Majority of the time  you're not happy.  Your moods shift  very quickly though.  This morning you came in  first thing  you didn't even,  you came in with sunglasses on  there was something  wrong with the orange.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you why  I don't like to waste food.  I told Eric last week  and maybe I have to tell  the interns  I don't want the oranges anymore  because for some reason  the oranges have been awful  so I'm not eating them  so I told him last week  no oranges.  I wasn't mad about that 
[00:56:30]  I just didn't want to waste food.  Right.  The reason I was in a bad mood  is because my laptop  another Dell product  I've had  every Dell product  I've ever owned  I've had a problem with  my laptop screen  is now pitch black  and there's a teeny thin  blue line at the bottom  almost like  and you can see  where the icons are  in the bottom  like the toolbar  the toolbar  I feel like a shade  a black shade  has been pulled down  over my entire screen  except for the bottom sliver. 
[00:57:00]  a little sliver  of your  That's why I don't know  if it's the LCD  Steve said it might be the LCD  but I don't know if it is  I feel like I'm hitting  a button or something  I don't know what this is  but it's very  Could very well be the monitor  my friend.  So there you go  about a $3,500 laptop  which I've had for a couple of years  60 gigs  and another Dell product  that I've had a problem with.  People told me  do not get a Dell laptop  do not do it  it's going to get fucked up  Well  you know something 
[00:57:30]  just call customer service  and I'm sure  they will get right on it  I'm sure they will  I'm sure that they'll have  some very marvelous  Yes Mr. Norton  there is a problem  with your monitor  Yeah and you'll go through that  for months and months  and months  If this screen  is fucked  and it's going to cost me  a grand or something  for a new screen  I'm going to throw it  out my 10th floor window  I'm going to throw it  That'll show them Jimmy  That'll show them  slightly irrational  You'll probably hit a child 
[00:58:00]  who will  their parents will sue you  They won't know  whose it is  you can't fucking  pull off the screen  Some guy  with a black monitor  threw this at my son  and hit him  So we have a list  of stuff that was  on your desk  Where did Ben go  and Steve  I don't know  They were the ones  that made this list  I guess they were  trying to clean up  your desk  and you didn't want  them to or something  Who said I didn't want them  No I don't know  I'm asking  I'm asking where  this came from  No because we're  trying to keep the office  nice and clean  or whatever  Ben is very sloppy 
[00:58:30]  He's the worst  He's always been like that  He's not going to change  Ben's little section  is just a mess  It's amazing  the pile of stuff  he has in front of him  I know where everything is though  No I know  We gave up  trying to get you  to be neat  To quote Joe Clark  Ben is a slovenly  sloppy boy  We were cleaning up  the office the other day  and we were throwing stuff out  and we were just looking  at Jim's desk  and we were like  what the hell is all this stuff  so then we decided  let's make a list 
[00:59:00]  because there's so much  crap on your desk  Just crap that shouldn't  even be there  Not necessarily funny  just stuff that  shouldn't be there  I don't know  but some of that stuff  you've gotten for weeks  and you've just left it there  But I put it to the side  I don't pile it up  So here's a list of stuff  on Jim's desk  Pat Battlepicture  Yeah big picture  of Pat Battle  is actually on  We're not even  talking about the show here  we're talking about  Jim's real desk  that he uses after  and before the show  a picture of Pat Battle 
[00:59:30]  I was signing those  by the way  in Cleveland  people were bringing  that Pat Battle picture  and they want it signed  it's fucking taken over folks  Alright  Aussie article  from two months ago  Oh yeah  I didn't read that yet  Haven't gotten to that yet  File that  A Sabra Cadabra  DVD  Some merchandise from them  A Black Sabbath CD  A package from Dell  What's in there?  I don't know  Where is it?  Someone go get it  There's been a package  from Dell in there  for weeks  Let's hope it's a laptop screen  Maybe they sensed it coming 
[01:00:00]  Of course  a box of porn  A pillow  What's that about?  It's on the couch  Yeah but while it was  on your desk  you moved it off  but that's been there  for a while  Skin care products  from a fan  Oh yeah  I forgot about that  Skin care products  Somebody sent me  some skin care products  Nice  You could use that  on your shaven mound  Yeah  Some Nexium  Yeah that's mine  Here's your Dell box  That's yours  I don't know what it is  Open that up  It hasn't even been  opened yet  Nah I'm bad  with stuff like this  Eight weeks ago 
[01:00:30]  A Fargo snow globe  Yeah but that's  up in the thing  That's not  Three Yankee DVDs  A talking fish  Yeah the talking fish  Someone sent one of  those talking bass  like a singing bass thing  and that found its way  onto Jimmy's desk  Well that was a bit  we tried to get going  that never really took off  Bad novelty items  Yeah we wanted people  to start sending in  their bad novelty items  What is that Jimmy?  That we could talk about them  and you know  put them up all over the studio  I don't know it's a hard drive  by Hitachi  This has nothing to do with me  This is shit 
[01:01:00]  Why is there a hard drive?  By Hitachi  I don't know  I guess maybe  a listener sent it to you  Alright I'll take it  No no no  It might be mine  Oh by the way  another technological problem  I had a lot of stuff  backed up on this  Maxter external  and of course  that's not working now  I just  I fucking hate computers man  Dell  Thank you Dell  Now I have  60 gigs of shit  Which is probably  not gettable  because of  my screen  just died apparently  So if anybody knows  there's a button I should hit 
[01:01:30]  That's the talking  catfish  and that's loud  Bass to the bone  Well that looks like a catfish  Whatever it is  it's going from hand  to the garbage can  because I'm never looking  at that again  that's horrendous  I wanted big pussy's mouth  like voice to come out of it  when I talked  Right  What's the matter?

They look good with their clothes on  When they take them off  Nothing better than a nice bag ripple down the side of a tit  Exactly  No good  You obviously have a certain standard that  Yeah, I do  You're working on a different level than the rest of us  I don't care  His standard is none  What about Jim Gaffigan? 
[01:12:00]  What's that, sir?  Implants or no implants?  I'm not, I'm all natural  I like the, you know, I got a stomach implant myself  And I'm tired of women  You know, I'll catch women staring at my gut  And I'll be like, hello, I'm up here  That's some piece of flab for you to oogle at  You know, just because I'm in a tube top  Rubbing cocoa butter  On a tricep going la la la la  Oh, he did a joke  That was pretty good  He did a joke  And then we have the severed head from a blow-up doll, Dennis  That's classic 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, that's for the ladies  When the ladies visit, they want to see that  I think that's in honor of the BTK killer  Oh, wow, huh?  I don't think he ever  We haven't played the audio yet  Jesus Christ  See the video of it?  Yeah  He's severely disturbed  If I could go out on a limb  Yeah, he really is  Yeah, just very matter of fact  So then I went over to Junior  But he looked like he was going down  So, you know, I finished him off  Then I went over to Mom  Just like reciting a recipe  And he says put them down  Yeah  So I put her down  And he used to be working a dog pound 
[01:13:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's using the terminology of his work  Which is really twisted, man  He probably worked there so he could kill something  That's probably why he even worked there  Just to kill the animals  The dog's just brought in  Yeah  All right, put him in the gas chamber  Yeah, he's sick  Well, I've got to choke him  She's on her way over  No, he's not good  I thought he had fleas  What?  What's this dog been here?  An hour a week?  He only choked the shit out of him  Yeah, that guy, man  It is frightening to watch  I want to see more 
[01:13:30]  That's the creepy part  Yeah, human nature is just the weirdest thing  Because he's so creepy  I want to see more of him reciting  Yeah  The death, you know, scenarios  Yeah, the whole  He just describes everything he did  Oh, the woman got sick  Yeah, fleets guilty  The woman threw up  I gave her a glass of water  Comforted her  Yeah  And then put a bag over her head  And choked her  What the fuck?  How do you switch like that?  I blame video  I blame violent video games myself  Yeah 
[01:14:00]  In the 50s  Yeah  I blame psychotic drugs  Oh, wow  Are you heard of Tom Cruise?  I'm joking  I just heard that about that  Tom Cruise Gaffigan  Psychotropic, isn't it what they were talking about?  I don't know, I'm not that smart  Yeah  You can't  I don't know  The actors that take themselves a little too seriously like that  What are you talking about?  Yeah  Yeah, what?  Huh?  Do you know Tom Cruise?  I know Tom  Is he really that, like, I know you don't have a bad mouth of him, that's cool  But is he like as exciting as he was in the Matt Lauer interview?  Is he like that in person? 
[01:14:30]  I don't know that side of Tom  I played hockey with Tom for years  He was on the same team as me out in L.A.  Jerry Bruckheimer's team  And he's a great guy  And we do some charity stuff together  And this stuff is all new to me  So  Do you try to hypnotize him with that Scientology stuff?  No, he never even talks about it  Really?  I don't know where  That's the dangerous thing  He's just right through the mind  Like a Jedi  He's just influencing you without words  I just want you to Catholic school  You can't get any God into me, man  It's all been sucked out  It's like going to prison and getting out 
[01:15:00]  It's all done  It's like doing push-ups  You know what I mean?  All the guilt and everything's just gone  You know?  I hope the nuns are happy  Some of the worst guys go out of Catholic school  You know what's funny is I was writing a scene for the show  Where my character goes back to the church  He gets religious again  And it was a comedy scene  Where he goes to confession for the first time in like 25 years  And the priest says  Say 10 Our Fathers and 10 Hail Marys  So the punchline was  That he comes out and goes up to the altar 
[01:15:30]  Kneels down  And he can't remember either prayer  So when I was writing it  I thought  Well, I'll just write it  Until I can't actually remember the real prayer  I could not get beyond the first two lines  Really?  Which I loved  I was like, yeah!  It's completely gone out of my head  I remember when  You know, because I went to Catholic school too  And I remember like  I was like the captain of the football team  And we'd always do a Hail Mary  Before we'd, you know, go and play  Or at halftime  And I never knew anything beyond  I'd always be 
[01:16:00]  Hail Mary  Our Father  Our Father who art in heaven  Hallowed be thy name  Thy kingdom come  Thy kingdom come  Without me approve  Written consent  I will be done  I don't know  On earth as it is in heaven  Give us this day our daily bread  And then the part in church  That always freaks me out  Because you hear the S's  And forgive us our trespasses  We forgive those trespasses  Nothing worse than being in a church  And hearing those S's  And I know it's coming up  And I anticipate it  Forgive us our trespasses  We forgive those trespasses  Yeah, Hail Mary 
[01:16:30]  Snakes in there  Full of grace  Lors with the  Blessings of the  Full of grace  I don't even know if that is  I don't know if it's going to burst  Into flames in a second  With us scumbags in here  I can remember my dad  Staring me down  Like our father would start  And he'd start looking at me  I'm like  Alright, I guess I'll say it  Well, the great thing about  The Catholic church  Is mostly white people  And there's a lot of mumbling  Even during the singing  Yeah  Yeah  Mostly  White people 
[01:17:00]  The good thing about  A neighborhood too  Those are the days  I could never get into  The singing at church  No way  I was the guy  Sitting there  Just like  I'm not even going to  Fake it  I had to be an altar boy  I got kicked out of  The altar boys  And the choir as well  But  I thought church sucked  And the first time  I went to a black church  When I was about  13 or 14 years old  I was like  Damn  They're having fun  Yeah, they're dancing  And singing  It could actually be fun  It could be like a concert  They're clapping  And singing  Yeah  And sweating 
[01:17:30]  I always had the dirtiest  Thoughts in church too  I was always like  Peace be with you  And an extra piece  For you  Because you deserve  Well, I think that's  That's not just church  And that's you  Kind of in general  Isn't it  That's why I have  My clothes off  Right now  The first time  I ever winked  At a girl  That was in church  I was like  Six or seven years old  And she was a cute blonde girl  And this is true  I was winking at it  And I didn't have to wink  So I just like  Did it too hard  And then I realized  It was a boy  Was this last week?  No  Little faggot  I had been winking  At a blonde boy  A six year old  Blonde boy 
[01:18:00]  Little queer  And why did you think  It was a girl?  I don't remember  It was like  One of those fucking odd  Like Tatum O'Neill age  Things where you just  Can't quite tell  You know  It's like  Kind of butchy  And kind of girly  Let me say one thing  I can't remember  Anything from when  I was six  Except that JFK  Got shot in the head  Which is a pretty big thing  Yeah  But winking at a girl  Well yeah  I'm 36  But I remember  You're way too old  To remember that kind of shit man  I only remember  Because I realized  Because it was a gay experience  Not really no  Once I realized  It was a boy 
[01:18:30]  I stopped  It wasn't like  I was like  Oh thank god  I stopped winking at boys  Right after that  That was the end of it  Yeah  Winking at boys  I realized my silly error  Notice the father  Started winking at him  Jesus  Well  True story  Hey really fast  We've had a girl on hold  For like two hours  Heather from Queens  She needs a little help  Heather  Hey guys  Oh she even fell asleep  Heather you're on the radio  With Jim Gaffigan  And Dennis Leary  Hey guys  How's everybody  Good  She's 22 years old

[01:22:30]  Showing the ghost  You know  That trail you man  A lot of us deal with that shit  That we  You know  We pretend that it doesn't bother us  But  I saw that on the show  And it got me hooked  And you know  We have all those people following you  And you know  The brother of the show  And everybody else  It kind of ties on you all the time  And that stuff really bothers you though  And you do a great job  And just keep it up man  I got hooked on that show  About two weeks into it  And watch every episode  Well make sure you watch tonight  At 10 o'clock  FX  Thanks for calling  It's a great 
[01:23:00]  You know  It is a great original idea  It's not just  You know  A remake of  Emergency  It's not just  A fireman show  Right  You know  There's a lot of cool twists  In there  And the whole thing  With 9-11  And the Fallen Brothers  And  Engine 51  Squad 51  Rampart  I'm starting an IV  With ringers  What the hell was a Rampart  Rampart was the hospital  Rampart hospital  And they had to hook up  Like what was a satellite unit  To just talk to people  Back at the hospital 
[01:23:30]  Sending his vitals now  You know  Send off a carrier pigeon  With something around  He remembers everything  Oh I was  I grew up in front of a television  And it just hasn't stopped  I did too  I don't remember  I don't remember the details like that  Oh I am  He's remembering  We had a boy  When he was six  You remember everything  About emergency  Wow  And look at our lives  The problem is  The problem is  On the other side of that  He doesn't leave his house  Right  I only remember people  When they get shot  That's how I  My giant post  That's your whole memory  JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King  John Lennon  You know 
[01:24:00]  There's a few other things  That's how I remember  My life  Hey Dennis  It was in the paper  The other day  That someone got shot  Or killed  Two guys got killed  Two guys got shot  On the set  Yeah  I mean it had nothing  To do with Rescue Me  No it was Sunday night  They got shot  But it was a set  They were using for the show  And then two guys  It's a firehouse set  The blood is still there  I don't know what it was about  But there's a gambling  Illegal gambling spot  In that neighborhood  So maybe it had something  To do with that  Probably  You know  It's kind of weird  Sometimes you have those dreams  Where you kill somebody  In your dream  And you wake up 
[01:24:30]  We're just talking about that  So I get up at 530  In the morning yesterday  I got in the truck  To go to work  And I open up the paper  And I go  Wait a minute  Because there's a big picture of me  And two murders on Rescue Me  And I'm going  Whoa whoa whoa whoa  Where was I  Oh no  It'll be like an urban legend  Larry killed Two guys  If you don't know your lines  Larry will kill you  You see the ghost of them  Walk past a window  On the show  They came unprepared to the set  They didn't know their lines  We talk about that man  It's like one of the most frightening  And relieving things 
[01:25:00]  When I've had dreams  Where I killed somebody  But it was a couple of years ago  Right  But the cops are just starting  To get on to it  And question me  And I start thinking  I left evidence  I know there's got to be stuff  I'm totally screwed  I'm going to prison  And you wake up  And go  Oh it was a dream  Thank God  You're out of trouble  In a second  It's the best feeling  Here's the question  What does OJ dream about  Right  Because if we're having  These dreams  Right  What's he dreaming about  That's something right  You know  Always sweating  Oh shit  Oh I dreamt on 
[01:25:30]  Oh shit  What's the other guy  Beretta  Yeah  Robert Blake  Robert Blake  He's just got to shut up  He's a loon  He's like  I don't care  That's that great  LA justice out there  Oh yeah  Don't know how to put him away  He really is the greatest  Robert Blake  Fat mouthy bitch  Forgot the gun  Be right back  Pardon me  Be right back  Whore  People  I think people have this  Inbred hate  Bonnie Lee Blakely  I think was the woman's name  People just have this  Hatred of her  It's almost like the public  Doesn't care that he did it  Yeah yeah  Once they found out  What she was like  They're like  People like Beretta 
[01:26:00]  They didn't like her  There really is a weird  Underlying sense  You're right though  If she had it coming  No one wants to say that out loud  People are like  She would have gotten sympathy  If she'd married like  Jerry Lee Lewis  You know what I mean  And drowned in a pool  But you know  Beretta  People are going to fall  In Beretta's favor  I mean that's just the way it is  Enjoy Beretta  I like that show  We liked it  We liked the bird  Remember the bird  Yeah  Had a bird  He was getting friends  With the old rummy guy  Yeah  Yeah that was good stuff  You don't want to put him away  Married the wrong murderer  You know  I could tell you all about that show  That's OJ too  He was like a very likable guy 
[01:26:30]  When he got arrested  It was a shock  Did he have a bird on his shoulder  Yeah  Oh yeah  Okay  Remember that  OJ  Not not film  In Roots  Yes  You're awful  He was in Roots  It was his cockatoo Fred  It was Beretta's cockatoo  There you go  Alright we got calls coming in  From all over the country  Brian in Kansas City  What's up Brian  We're on the radio  With Dennis Leary  And Jim Gaffigan  Good morning guys  Hey  Dennis I love the show  But I have to ask you 
[01:27:00]  I mean you deal with  All the high drama  Of you fighting  And trying to get help  And going through that  And how in the hell  Do you get the two old men  With prostitutes  A monkey  Popping pills  And drinking  I know  It's fun right  Oh just hilarious  I just want to know  How they make that connection  I mean it's just  And I try to get my fiancee  Involved in the show  And I tell her how great it is  And then the episode  We turn on is that one  And she's like  How in the hell  Does this get to a great drama  So  But no I love the show  Just the writing  Is just so off the wall sometimes 
[01:27:30]  It's just really  You know  Amazes me  Where they come from  It's great  Because it's different  Than all the other shit on TV  And it's realistic man  That's the beauty of it  You know  You don't play characters  That are like  Fucking soft and cute  Which I love  They're always like  Some fucking edgy guy  With problems  Who cheats  Who's like a douche  I mean that's the greatest man  I know  It's never like a perfect guy  I know  Unfortunately that's  Most of the people I know  Yeah and I know you guys  Don't like me  Actually I'm an attorney  So I'm not a down syndrome kid  But I have a lot of clients  I deal with in criminal law  That have drug addiction  Stuff like that  And I mean  I see exactly 
[01:28:00]  What you're going through  On TV sometimes  In real life  And I gotta tell you  It's just amazing  How realistic it is  And how I really root for you  And your character  On that show  It's really cool  Oh thanks man  Alright thanks Brian  Thank you  Obviously a very smart listener  Let's move on to Scott  Scott what's up  Hey guys  Hey Dennis  I'm a huge fan  And I think Rescue Me  And I'm not saying it  Because you're on the  O&A show today  But I honestly think  Rescue Me  Is the greatest show  That's ever been on television  Me and my wife 
[01:28:30]  Talk each week  It's like watching a movie  Wow  I mean it's like  Watching a movie  Every week  It's not like a series  There's nothing  Anything like it  Honest to God  Man it is the greatest  Thing we've ever seen  On TV  FX  Sorry  FX  FX rules  They got other  Great shows too man  But I just wanted  To let you know  It's great  Don't change anything  And just keep it going  Alright Scott  Thanks man  That is a real compliment  Of your show  You know what I mean  It's like when a show  Is really good  It is like a movie 
[01:29:00]  And you know  The amazing thing  It's like so much better  Than all the  All the crappy movies  That are out there  Yeah  Well you know  I've done  I did  30 films  And it's like being  A baseball player  Because you look back  And you realize  If you did 30 films  And you could get  Like 7 to 10 of those  That you were proud of  You're a  You know  You're doing good  Because most movies suck  Right  And you know  The thing is  What I found anyways  Is that  Two or three weeks in  You know  Pretty much 
[01:29:30]  That  Oh really  You really do  Because the director  That doesn't know  What he's doing  Or she doesn't know  What she's doing  Or the  You know  The actors are assholes  And you know  And it doesn't have  The right feel  Or whatever  And you're stuck in Utah  For 16 more  God damn weeks  You know what I mean  So I'm really happy  To be doing TV  And be in New York  And be able to  You've got to have  A thick skin too  You know you're in  A bad situation  Yeah I don't have  A thick skin  You know the review  Is going to suck  And you're like  Ugh  You also don't want  I'm the kind of guy  That just tells people  Right you know  Fuck you  And this sucks  And I'm not doing this 
[01:30:00]  And you know  You also don't want  Those seven good films  At the first seven  Of the 30 that you make  Yeah  And then along came  Probably  Plus when they say  12 weeks in Utah  You know it's going to be  You know 18  I don't know if you've been  To Utah but  Yeah  What was your favorite movie  You did  My favorite  What do you mean  In terms of having fun  Or  Yeah just in general  It doesn't necessarily  Have to be your best film  What was the  I had a blast  What was the best time  You had  Doing  Everything I did  With Ted Demme  I had a blast  Because Ted was fun  But I had a blast  Doing Wag the Dog  Because that was 
[01:30:30]  Like a lot of improv  I loved Wag the Dog  Beniro and Hoffman  I had a really good time  I forgot you were in that movie  No offense  Holy crap  That's right  The movie final  We had a good time  Shooting that  Now if I take movies  I take the movie  Based on am I going  To have a good time  Or not  And not so much  How it's going to come out  Because you can't tell  How it's going to come out  So if it's going to  Shoot someplace I like to be  With some people that I like  Then I'll do it  You read a script  And just go  You have no clue  If it's going to be  Good bad shit  Well I mean  You can't tell anyways  Because there's so many 
[01:31:00]  You know  Plates up in the air  The director  And the studio and stuff  But like literally  I did a film with  Campbell and Hope  Again called  Secret Lives  Is that just because  I knew I was going to  Have a good time  You know  Because I like them  And we're going to  You know  Laugh our asses off  You ever think  You read a script  And think it's going to  Be really good  And wow this has potential  And just doesn't quite pan out  Oh yeah  Christ yeah  You know it's also  It's interesting with  Rescue Me  It's like  You seem to have found  The formula  Of like  You know with Peter Tolan 
[01:31:30]  Because it's  It's you know  It's hard to pull it  All together  You know what I mean  It's like  You know  It's like Peter Tolan  You guys write it together  And all that  And you know  It's just  Well it's also the actors  I mean we have great  We have people who can do  Comedy and drama  So you know  And great looking girls  You know  It's a nice combo  Yeah that's awesome  And we shoot New York  Which you can't beat  Yeah  That's so true  FX letting you get away  With murder  Oh yeah  Yeah  It's amazing  I keep laughing  Because the Today Show  Is doing fashion  Fashion do's and don'ts 
[01:32:00]  Do's and don'ts  Another original idea  The pictures they're showing  Are so fucking funny  Because you know what  I don't know what's going on  I don't remember this  When we were kids  But  Maybe it's because  Of the fashion thing  With the  What do they call them  The low riders  The pants  Yeah  Way too many girls  Who shouldn't be  Here's where the terrorists  Have a good idea  I think we need  Vans driving around the city  To pass out burkas  Okay  Basically they pull over  They grab you  You gotta wear a burka  Until you lose 100 pounds  That's it 
[01:32:30]  That's it  And the same thing with guys  There's fat guys out there  Wearing the wrong clothes  Yeah  I saw a chick wearing low riders  And I'm not kidding  My son saw it  He can back me up  Down in Soho  Her ass was so big  And the pants were so small  That the top four inches  Of her ass  Including the crack  Were up over the top  Of the pants  And leaning down  Over the top  Of the pants  Like flapping over the top  Yeah  Men and women  Were turning around  Going ugh  And at that point  You gotta be picked up  Your boyfriend's  Not telling you the truth  Something's wrong  How do you leave the house 
[01:33:00]  How do you just look  At the ass  Well see  That's the problem  With democracy  These people are allowed  To leave the house  In anything they want  Allowed to leave  We need to take a piece  Of the terrorist creed  And attach it to our democracy  They can't be 100% wrong  With everything they do  No some things  They're right about  You gotta hit on something  Perkins for the big women  Okay  You know you got a mustache  You're wearing the veil  Right the whole veil  Yeah  It's just those hash shirts  It's just you're like  Come on man  With the gut  Yeah it's just  You know  What about the juicy wear  The juicy  I fucking love those dudes 
[01:33:30]  The fat ass  With juicy written on them  Fat ass  Or a nice ass  Fat like little chubby  I like that  When it's a fat ass  It should say swamp ass  Now there's the problem  You're part of the problem  I really am  Because you like the fat ass  Girls in the tight jeans  Not fat like this guy  Like you know  A guy like you  Is in these apartments  Saying you look good honey  Go shopping  Walk around the city like that  Jimmy likes a good full ass  Right Jimmy  Yeah  That's a fucking nice one  Really  Borderline  Almost fat  Borderline  Yeah I kind of like that  I like that a lot  And boys in church 
[01:34:00]  Fat ass girl  Only blonde boys though  I'm not a complete queer  You know  Who can resist  Smooth abs  Let's go to Kerry  Kerry what's up  Hey  Morning boys  What's up  We're talking to Dennis Leary  And Jim Gaffigan  Hey  Dennis  Yeah  Dude  Dude you're awesome  Thanks  You're fucking hilarious  I loved you with Demolition Man  Oh boy  When you went through  Your whole cheeseburger spiel  Right  Oh  That was awesome  Thanks Chris Farley  I think your best work  Was narrating the Red Sox 
[01:34:30]  Championship DVD  My friend  Well it's got to be up there  Oh you  Dude  I got goosebumps  Listening to you describe  This year  Alright  Alright  Enough of this  Hey hey hey  This guy's on the right track  Enough of this shit  Yeah we got some  Met fans and Yankee fans  Yeah that was my  That's actually my  Favorite thing I ever did  And then when you get out your  Groceries  I love that  We all suck  Compared to the world champion  Red Sox  That's right  Dennis did you believe  When it was three  Three zip  No I actually thought 
[01:35:00]  In St. Louis  Because I'm a  You know  A Red Sox fan  From way back  That people don't realize this  But I actually have it framed  Because there was a picture  In the paper the next day  When they changed  Pictures in the  Ninth  Johnny Damon was talking  Of Gabe Kapler  So it was number 19  Talking to number 18  In center field  Number three was at bat  For the  Cardinals  Renteria who's with the Sox now  And I thought  Now  They're going to win  Four in a row  They're going to take it away 
[01:35:30]  From the Red Sox  The way the Red Sox  Took it away from the Yankees  That's what I thought  Was going to happen  Yeah  I was biting my nails  Thinking this is the  Beginning of the end  But I was wrong  So  Did you believe though  When the Yankees  Were up three zip  Do you have any faith still  Until game five  After game five  I thought  Wait a minute  Yeah that's what  Something's wrong  That's what I started thinking  The Yankees didn't  The Yankees didn't look  They looked tight  You know  That fucking David Ortiz  He is a Yankee girl  Like I've never seen  He murders the Yankees man  Fuck  I thought it was  One of the greatest things 
[01:36:00]  Besides the birth  Of my two kids  That was just like  I can't describe to you  How happy I was  Yeah  You got the World Series  Just after game seven  Oh yeah  I was so god damn happy  Yeah we were happy for you  Yeah  It was such a great feeling  We were happy for you  Little Ben running around here  All excited  Oh the worst part  Was watching that idiot  Be happy  Oh  I didn't even mind  Seeing Boston fans happy  I mean I've been  Taking it in the ass  For a long time  But just seeing that  Fucking dumb Ben happy  Really irritated  Our stupid producer 
[01:36:30]  Deserves no happiness  Let's go to Alex  Alex what's up  Hey Dennis  I just want to tell you  I love Rescue Me  I want to tell you  It was great  Watching Cam Neely  Out there on the ice  With you guys  And just wanted to ask you  Do you think the league  Can bounce back  There's a season this year  For the NHL  Oh yeah  Big hockey fan  Probably not until January  I think they got to get  All the contracts straightened up  But keep your eyes open  Because Cam's coming back  On the show  In episodes  Nine  Which is  About six weeks away 
[01:37:00]  So  You know I'm a huge  Islanders fan  And I got the bill  In the mail the other day  For my season tickets  They didn't lower the prices  After all the shit  I don't know what  They're thinking man  Are they insane  You know how many people  You got to give something  Back to the fans  To get them back  In the building  Holy shit really  I want to cancel  My season ticket  How much do they cost  Per game  I don't have the bill  In front of me  I got four seats  And it's ridiculous  The prices  I want to give up  My season tickets  Completely  But I got some nephews  I want to take to the games  They don't understand  The lockout 
[01:37:30]  And the strike  And it's like  So of course  I got to get  Some kind of package  You got to do it  For the kids  But I'm not getting  The whole package now  Because of what happened  And I can't believe  I got the bill  And they didn't lower  The prices at all  To try to  You know say  Well look  This is what we're  Doing for you guys  You know  Baseball got hurt  By the strike  Hockey's definitely  Going to be hurt  Huge  Huge  Second of all  You know what was weird  You know we didn't have  A season last year  And I'm a huge fan  After a while  You didn't even care  What was in the papers  About the lockout  You know what was  Really weird  Is kids like my son  Stopped playing  The video games  Of hockey 
[01:38:00]  Yeah because there was  Nothing on TV  To remind them  You know  To get the interest up  So that's where  They really  Screwed themselves  You know  Didn't even think of that  I know  Takes away that whole  All the young kids  Just went on  They went on to  Lacrosse  And you know  Basketball  And you know  Smoking pot  They really screwed themselves  It was picking up  A lot of steam  In the country too man  Hockey was like  People really started  To talk about it more  It was just getting  A lot more recognition  Bad move  I love going to hockey games  It's so exciting  I've heard it's great  Live  It's the best live sport 
[01:38:30]  In the world  As somebody says  I've never been to a hockey game  It's amazing  Really?  Why not?  Take a puck to that head  I don't go to a lot  Of sporting events  What?  They don't take off  To watch me  Like I love fucking  I love the Yankees  I've never seen Jeter  Play live  The last game I went to  Was 95  Fucking Yankees  Seattle  15 inning win  Over the Mariners  In Yankee Stadium  When the Yankees  Play  It's kind of like  You think you're  At like a beauty contest  Because it's like  Derek Jeter  And all the girls  Go  Ooh  It's just like 
[01:39:00]  They just said  Bernie Williams  Oh  Bernie  Nobody wants to  Fuck Bernie Williams  Dude  It's so funny  To say that  Mrs. Williams  In New York  In New York  When they had  The first  Subway series  They actually did  A whole article  In the post  About who's hot  Dirk Jeter  Or Mike Piazza  Oh right  And I remember  They gave their stats  And stuff  Who did you vote for  I like Alfonso  I've got a body  On that kid  All right  Let's go back  To the phones  And say hi  To Joe  On Long Island  Joe what's up 
[01:39:30]  Hey not too much  I just didn't want  To leave Gaffigan out  You know  Those Sierra Miss  Commercials  Pretty much comparable  To Dennis to 30 films  Yeah it's very similar  No we were just  Talking about that  It's a different  Shoot schedule  Than Rescue Me  I work for five days  And he works for five months  But  Dude as a comedian  Do you know what it's like  To hear Leary go  Yeah I was improv  With Hoffman  And De Niro  And my fucking credits  Are Voss  And Otto  And George  That's who I worked  With in films  It is amazing  Oh well thank you sir  I appreciate that 
[01:40:00]  Let's go to sit  And rock one  I like those  Sierra Miss commercials  Eh  What's Sierra Miss  And there's him  It's a little lime drink  It's like Sprite  But it's not Sprite  Would you turn your television on  And not put pornography in  For a second  Just for a second  Yeah Jim's not up on  Pop culture  He knows nothing about  Pop culture at all  And I'm talking  Not even like  What's hit this month  Or this quarter  I'm talking 20 years  He didn't know  Who Jessica Alba was  I had no idea  I honestly got  I found a song  This girl played a song  I loved it  I love this song  I'm like what the fuck  Is this song 
[01:40:30]  It was Rosemary Clooney  Come out of my house  I swear to God  I'd never heard  I'm like this is fucking great  This is so like weird  The guy is  This is what the kids are wanting  Pop culture  Sometimes aren't you embarrassed  At the entertainment information you know  You're like just like  Occasionally you'll just come up with  We have to be up on it  You're like  Never be embarrassed of your knowledge  Good point  And good point  Where it lies  I can't believe I know that much  About Paris  We know a lot about shark attacks  I'm not sleeping with her  Why would I do that  Oh we learned everything we need to know  About shark attacks 
[01:41:00]  Yeah we're up on our shark attack knowledge  So we can inform the rest of the country  We learned how dangerous it is  Down there in Florida  Where since like 1886  12 people have been killed by shark attacks  Since 1886  And the news is treating it like  You're just  A shark buffet is going on  On the coast of Florida  Let me tell you something about sharks  They're out there  They're out there  You know  They're everywhere  You know  So you gotta be careful with these sharks 
[01:41:30]  It doesn't matter  That only 12 people have died  In over 100 years  I think the facts are not  Completely reflected  In those stats that you're quoting  I think a lot more people just disappear  I think the BTK guy  Yeah  You know  I mean that's nothing compared to the people  Just disappear  Just disappear to the sharks  Well sometimes people are assholes  And when they disappear  Nobody tells anybody  Nobody misses them  People are happy  Embarrassed that they were beat by a shark  What was I doing  Punching a shark  What was I doing with sharks  Yeah  That's like frightening enough 
[01:42:00]  I was feeding a shark  Who's this  This is that girl  That's the one armed girl  At 13 she had her arm bitten off in Hawaii  Does she have to pose  Bethany Hamilton  In front of the fucking surfboard  With the teeth marks taken out  Would you rather she pose armful  Is that her  Wow she's getting ugly  Why doesn't she get a fake arm  What happened  Yeah get a fake arm  And wear long sleeves  You know  Nah she's proud of it  You know  Well she got a book deal out of it  Oh she did  What happened  She was a cute little kid  I want to read about it  She got her arm bit off  Maybe she can only apply half her makeup 
[01:42:30]  You are terrible  Dude she got really ugly  Since she got bit by that shark  She's going through a phase  It's probably just a phase  That's it  Puberty is hitting I guess  Be nice  She's kind of cute  Be a real pervert  And don't look at her face  Look at her body  Can't see it  Can't see it  They only show the top  The above  They don't want to show the stump  No those  Yeah you're right  They're not showing it  No they'll show the stump  There it is  There it is  She's proud of it  She's wearing short sleeves  It even shrugs  The stump is awful 
[01:43:00]  It even shrugs  You're wonderful Jimmy  No no but when she shrugs  The stump moves  Jimmy's biggest concern  She can't tweak my nipples  And jerk me off  At the same time  Look how awful that is  Doggy stop  With 30 seconds of the clip  Right  I get it  You're tired  I heard you  Oh my god  See you can do anything  On satellite radio  You really can  Horrible man you are  Let's go to Sid in Rockland  Sid what's up  Sid  Hello  Sid got eaten by a shark 
[01:43:30]  I think you're right  How about John in Jersey  John  Hey Dennis  I just wanted to let you know  My dad's a retired  New York City firefighter lieutenant  Absolutely loves this show  Oh that's good to hear  It's never like any firefighter show before  He's like 55  I mean  Goes nuts for it  I think you hit on something man  Thanks man  Yeah  You're done sir  I  I'm teasing  Anything else  Did you hang up on him  Yeah he's out  There she is  Look at her  Look at her  They have the  She's swimming with one arm 
[01:44:00]  She's falling off an inner tube  She was surfing a couple years ago  Now she's  She's going to get eaten by more sharks  I'm telling her right now  She's just shark bait  No no  She's in a lake now  She wants to lose a leg  She's still surfing  Is she really  She's a surfing sensation  Yeah way to go  I got a roll  She did  Why  I got to go back to work  Oh you do  I was going to say  The love fest  To all the firemen  That are coming out  But I've heard a couple of people  A little perturbed  With the portrayal of  Yeah well there's some guys  Who aren't particularly happy 
[01:44:30]  About having the  Almost 95% of the stories  That we tell on the show  Are true  It's a pretty accurate portrayal  Of the way firemen  It's accurate  Based on the guys that I know  And of course  You're going to glean  The more interesting stories  Rather than the boring stories  But the way that I gauge it  Is the guys  The most outrageous stories  That we've told  The guys that the stories  Belong to in real life  Those guys love the show  So as far as I'm concerned  You know  It's  But you've heard  When we were doing the job  There was a lot of cops  Who were pissed off  Because we were giving away 
[01:45:00]  The secrets  You know  Yeah  So I think that's a reflection  Of that you're doing the job right  Because let's face the facts  If everybody was happy  Yeah  The show would suck  True  You know  So we've been making  You know  The Bruce Willis movies  If we were doing that  You really have to go  I gotta go  I gotta go write  Another episode of the show  I thought we were all  Just having fun and stuff though  But Dennis  If I were you Dennis  I would like to perk with Jimmy  I gotta go back to work  Jimmy was just starting  To wink at you  He was  I noticed that  It kind of freaked me out  But we were all just  Warming up and getting  Comfortable with it 
[01:45:30]  Well I'll come back  I'll come back  Washington  You know what I'll do  I'll come back  And I'll bring  Lenny Clark with me  Yeah we love Lenny  You know  Washington wants me to  Hand this to you personally  A MiFi  An XM MiFi  Is there a portable unit  Can I get one of those  Oh Jim Gaffigan  Come on  You could have given it  To him outside  I think the most generous  Thing you could do  Is be to  Hand that over  Get Jim Gaffigan  Give it to your side  I think we got a Walkman  A Walkman 
[01:46:00]  We got a Walkman  For Jim Gaffigan  Give it to the guy  That doesn't have a car  Who can't you ever get a car  Is this the one  That I can have in the truck  And then take with me  When I walk out of the truck  Yeah  Dennis it's amazing  I was talking about getting this  And then when you're on a plane  Before you go  You can record channels  And then listen on the plane  Oh cool  Because I have the mounted thing  In my truck  You know  It just sits there  You can't take it out  That one you could record  Four hours of programming  And then play it back  When you're deep beneath the earth  Is that available at XM.com  XMRadio.com 
[01:46:30]  XMRadio.com  We'll get you a MiFi  You mean at JimGaffigan.com  JimGaffigan.com  Is there a JimGaffigan.com  There is a JimGaffigan.com  Dennis  I think there is a clip  From the movie I did with you  The final  I had to carry Dennis down the hall  He did  That was a very  You know what was funny  Is that we were working  On this thing for like a month  It was a real  You know  Down and dirty shoot  But a lot of fun  And I'm working with this guy  For like a month  And he's  To me  He's just the actor  Who's playing the guard 
[01:47:00]  And he was really good  And at the end  His last day  His last scene  He goes  By the way  I wanted to tell you  I'm a comedian  I'm a good friend of Eddie Brills  And I know all these other guys  And I said  Why the fuck  Didn't you tell me  You were a comedian  In the beginning  And I felt weird about it  Well sometimes  You know  It's like  You probably  Well you're probably  Beyond this  But like  You know  As a comedian  If you go into  An acting situation  Where you're the comedian  Right  If you stumble over a line  They're like  Well the comedian  You're right  You're right  You're right  They don't know  How to say a line  Right  You're right  You're right  They're used to just curse it 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  I'm just the opposite  When I act  I'm so intimidated  By real actors  I have to let them  Know I'm a comedian  Because even when  I'm sucky in the scene  It's like  Well I can still do  Something tonight  That you can't do  Fucko  I'm so nervous  Around real actors  I thought it was  Really  So that way  If you screw up  They can go  Oh he's the comedian  No no no no  I don't really get nervous  Around anybody anymore  Except like Satan  And Jesus  You know  Pretty much  You've been in the shit  For a while  I'm sure early on  It was probably  A little intimidating  Right  What was your first movie  Your first like  Real movie  No that wasn't intimidating  Because it was more 
[01:48:00]  I was learning the thing  I was actually intimidated  When I did a film  With Clint Eastwood  And the idea  I talked to him on the phone  I hadn't met him yet  And stuff  And flying out there  I was like  Fuck Clint Eastwood  Yeah  As soon as I met the guy  He was such a regular guy  I was like  Well fuck  I'm done  Nobody's going to impress me now  Clint Eastwood  You know what I mean  That's like John Wayne  Getting that shit  He was just such a normal  Regular guy  And he treated everybody  Like you know  Equal  And he was just like  A guy that was working  On the film  You know  Smoked like a banshee 
[01:48:30]  And you know  Did he really still smoke?  He smoked then  He was playing  I was playing a non-smoker  He was playing a smoker  And he smoked  Camel Down Filters  Non-stop  For two months  And I had just quit smoking  So it was bugging the shit  I mean  Which is good  How many times  Have you quit smoking?  Once  That one time  Yeah  Didn't pan out  Did it?  I did it for like  A year  And then  That's when my cousin  Got killed  And that's a cheap excuse  But that's pretty much  What happened  Any excuse  Man  Yeah  Next thing you know  You're smoking  The wonderfulness  That is 
[01:49:00]  Cigarettes  Hey did anyone  Any of those Hollywood people  When Clint was smoking  Go Clint  You really  You can't  Nobody tells Clint  What they're doing  Clint was doing a scene  One day  With a hundred extras  Behind us  In the newsroom  And he does like  Two takes  And that's it  At the most  You know  And he's really  Does his homework  He knows what's going on  At all times  So we're doing  A scene with me and him  And now it's time  For his close up  And they put the camera up  And he starts to say  His monologue  And this guy  This extra  About four rows back  Starts coughing  I mean just a thing 
[01:49:30]  That can happen  To anybody right  So Clint waits  For a second  And then he starts  Talking again  And the guy goes  And he turns around  And he looks at the guy  And he goes  You alright  And the guy goes  Yeah  I'm fine  He goes  Why don't you step outside  And get some fresh air  He goes  No no I'm fine  He goes  Step outside  And the guy froze  And he got up  And walked outside  And Clint just looked at him  All the way out  And as soon as he left  He did his monologue  And I was like  Wow  That's Clint Eastwood  You step outside 
[01:50:00]  For a long time  Thrown out by Clint  How about that asshole  How'd the shoot go  Well Clint threw me out  For wrecking his monologue  I was coughing  During Clint's monologue  What a fucking boob  You know  Yeah exactly  You're in a scene  With Eastwood  And you're coughing  And you're kicked out  But that guy's amazing  He's 74 years old  This year  And he directed that film  Million Dollar Baby  In which he does  Some of the best acting work  He's ever done  At age 74  Yeah  There's hope for all of us  You know  Hey Dennis  Thanks man  Thanks Dennis  Thanks for the present  Quick break  I gotta pee 
[01:50:30]  Hey this is Dennis  Cleary  Listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  The Opie and Anthony Show  The Village  Oh now here's a bit  Uh huh  That I want to personally  Rehear  Yes  It was a good one  It was a very good bit  It was a good bit  Jimmy sees The Village  And he hates it  Especially Joaquin Phoenix's  Acting and whispering  And the whole plot  Of the movie  Is destroyed for me  By the way  Why?  During the conversation  Oh because they were  Actually in modern times  Just kind of acting  Like they were  In times before 
[01:51:00]  Yeah I saw it Jim  Just in case someone else didn't  In case I wanted to watch it again  You just ruined it  Alright so uh  I watched it  And uh  My review is a little different  Than Jimmy's  You hated it  No  You did  I didn't  You didn't  But yeah  Just tune in for Jimmy's  Joaquin Phoenix impression  It's worth the price of admission  Without a doubt  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Lo mas mal  De Opie  En Anthony  En XM2  Zero dos  Alright one other thing 
[01:51:30]  From Jim Norton  Before we move on here  You just came in  With the Village DVD  And you're just  Completely outraged  He was livid  When he came in  I'm holding it up  He was speechless  He just holds it up  So he can look at it  And he's just like  You notice what time  He came here too  Like 520  Like what's wrong  You have a fever or something  Been up all night  But he walks in  With the DVD  Just in his hand  It's not even in his bag  Or whatever  Well he doesn't have  Any of that stuff  He just throws a coat on  And comes in here  Why  Never mind  But he's holding the DVD 
[01:52:00]  And he's just  Ranting and raving about it  Yeah  In a bad way  In Chicago  And I'm tempted  To get on a plane  And go get a refund  This  That bad  Piece of crap  Could be the worst thing  I've ever seen in my life  I actually at one point  Thought that this  M. Night  Shemalama ding dong  Exactly  Is awful  I thought this might be a comedy  I'm like  This  This  This can't be  Serious  The acting  Was atrocious 
[01:52:30]  Atrocious  The story  Was atrocious  The village  I would have liked this more  If it was about  Greenwich Village  And instead of red cloaks  They all wear chaps  And drank out of each other's mules  Everything you've done  Freshly bleached hair  Yeah  I was going to say  Starring by TV Steve  Bunch of cozy creatures  In the woods  In the village  They're not  They're not monsters  They're bears  They just hug you  If you cross the magic line  Beware the sweet face 
[01:53:00]  It was not a horror film  I thought the acting was good  The acting was atrocious  Now looking at the commercials  For it  It was presented  Like some type of  Horror film  In the same vein  As  What was the other movie  You put out  Six Sands  Which was great  No Signs  Yeah  And Signs  You put out Signs  So I was thinking  It was going to be like that  I have not  I have not seen this movie  Oh  Don't worry  You could ruin it for me  I don't care  I won't ruin it for you 
[01:53:30]  But I'll tell you who will  Joaquin Phoenix  Whose next film  Should be called  Breakdancing in front of the Viper  Awful  You didn't like his acting  When  It stunk  When the retarded character  In the film  Oh Adrian Brody  Stabbed him  That was the  No I actually liked  When he got stabbed  I didn't like the fact  That he did live  The only part of the movie  I liked is when  Adrian Brody's face  Got slapped  Because a retard being slapped  Is always amusing  Always amusing  Sigourney Weaver 
[01:54:00]  Stunk  Now  You're saying  The acting's horrible  William Hurt  But William Hurt's a great actor  He was awful  Sigourney Weaver's a very good actress  Sure  She is  Yeah I suppose so  Star studded cast I might add  It was amazing  Didn't Brody win an Oscar  He certainly did  For the  For the penis  Yeah the piano  The pianist  The pianist  Yeah the pianist  Who else  Who's the chick  Her last name is Howard  Something Howard  Yeah  Stop ripping me off Robin  Brianna 
[01:54:30]  She was atrocious  Whatever  Really  So the acting  Horrific  I thought it was  As a goof  There's a clip here  Where she  This one woman  Is like thinking  Of proposing marriage  To Joaquin Phoenix  Yeah  And I  This  I thought  This was like  Meant to be a comedy  I'm like  This has to be ironic  She can't really be acting  So she gets up  All the courage  And she walks up to him  It's supposed to be  Like this 1800 setting  Yeah  And he's like  He's sharpening a sword  And if you got  The first clip 
[01:55:00]  This is what she said  This is her  Like telling him  That she loves him  Good afternoon  Lucius  I wanted to  To tell you something  I love you  Lucius  I love you  Like the day  Is long  I love you  More than the sun  And the moon  Together  And if you feel 
[01:55:30]  The same way  Then we should not  Hide it any longer  It's a gift  Love is  We should be thankful  We should  Bellow it out  With all the breath  In our lungs  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you  That's the next scene  After he like  Doesn't react  That's her crying  I just wanted that in there  Because that's how I felt  Watching this film  Do you realize 
[01:56:00]  Wow that acting  Is really bad  It's like listening  To Blair's cousin  Jerry do Shakespeare  It's horrible  That's Bryce  Dallas Howard  Oh  Dude  Ron's daughter  That is Ron's daughter  It is  I'm like  It has to be his daughter  We're hurting at acting work  She is atrocious  Well the reviewers  I remember at the time  Thought she did a fantastic job  With this movie  Really  Yeah that's what I'm  You know  Just saying  Now it's not a horror movie  By any stretch of the imagination  Well they definitely marketed it 
[01:56:30]  As a horror  Yes they did  Flick  And when I saw it  When the credits  You know started rolling  Everyone got really pissed off  People started throwing  Some of their refreshments  Going that's it  Really  That's it  That's it  One of those movies  That ends and you're like  Oh no  Don't you dare roll the credits  Yeah this is BS  That's it  I actually  I also had Steve  Joaquin Phoenix  Has this thing he does  He's on the same  Like success path  As you know  Jim Belushi  Or name someone else  Who had a more gifted brother  Kick the bucket  At a young age  And he does this thing 
[01:57:00]  Where he whispers  Because he really is not  A good actor  So to get emotion  He whispers  And that's his way  Of being passionate  Is he whispers  And it's enragingly bad  Because I don't know  Why actors somehow think  That makes you seem passionate  It makes you seem hoarse  It's awful  So I have a thing  Of him and Bryce  I think this is Bryce  Or the other dingbag  This is Joaquin's monologue  I believe  I love this Jimmy's review  It's just him and her talking 
[01:57:30]  And she says something  And he's passionate  When we are married  Will you dance with me?  I find dancing very agreeable  Why can you not say  What is in your head?  Why can you not stop  Saying what is in yours?  Why must you lead? 
[01:58:00]  When I want to lead  If I want to dance  I will ask you to dance  If I want to speak  I will open my mouth  And speak  I'm coming in forever  Blake  I need to speak forever  I will get to the  Whitey voice  I will get to the  Whitey voice  He does do that  In a lot of roles  Here's why  He stinks  Oh Joaquin  Anybody with a silent J 
[01:58:30]  In the beginning of their name  Joaquin  Is going to stink  Yeah  That wasn't his thing  And M. Night  Should be  He really should be  Gutted  For writing this dialogue  But she says to him  On our wedding night  Will you dance with me? 
[01:59:00]  I find dancing  To be agreeable  How do you go through  A read through  With a bunch of actors  And she says that  And somebody doesn't  Throw hot coffee at her  How does that happen?  I swear to God  Because they're all  Agreeable in Hollywood  I was teetering  Thinking that this  Might be some kind  Of an ironic  Parody  Of horrible acting  Really?  William Hurt  Is a good actor  And he  Stinks in it 
[01:59:30]  Nobody was  I didn't get any  Sigourney stuff  I believe  I can go back through it  And have some later this week  She also was  Atrocious  Now what is it  About the story  That is so bad?  Well what's happening  In the film  And I won't give it away  Is that there are  It's a village  I kind of like the idea  Yeah  Well that's  We part company  I have no idea  What it's about  It's people like  It's like an 1800 setting  Right  And they live in this  Little village  And they're walled off  From the forest  They don't go into the forest  And the creatures 
[02:00:00]  Who apparently are  Acting coaches  Don't come into their village  The creatures stay in the forest  And red is the bad color  Don't go into the forest  Don't go into the forest  Don't go into the forest  Or anywhere near the Golden Globes  So they stay in the village  And of course you're going to have  That overachiever  That has to go in the forest  Of course  Yes  Okay  That's the bad part of the movie  So far  Nothing bad  Yeah but you know  Somebody that knows nothing about this  That's what I hate about Hollywood  You can you know 
[02:00:30]  You watch these movies  Like oh let me guess  There's going to be an overachiever  That has to  Has to push the limits  Of the village  And has to go see  What's out there  Well because this is  Such an original concept  There is a council of elders  Which was just such a  Conceptually brilliant thing  For a film  And at one point  I don't want to give anything away  Joaquin Phoenix  Is stabbed by retard  Adrian Brody  Stabs him  When he finds out  That Joaquin  Is going to  I hope I didn't spoil it for anyone  Is going to marry the girl  That he likes 
[02:01:00]  Who's blind by the way  Not the one who said  I love you  We should shout it  Not that one  No  But the one who said  I would like to dance  Dancing is agreeable  I guess because you'll never drive  Whore because you're blind  She's the one who  The 1800s  Yeah that was a good point  Well  But  But it's not the 1800s Anthony  Oh  Oh  Whoops  Oh no  Oh Jesus  Oh no  You wrecked it  Oh  Oh  Wow  Alright  Now that's kind of a cool twist 
[02:01:30]  Wait it's not a cool twist  No  It stinks  It's not  There's one part where  The girl wants to go into the towns  For the medicine  I gotta recover from this  Yeah  That is a complete ruin of the movie  They have to go into the towns  Wow  To get medicine for  Joaquin  For Joaquin Phoenix  Is gonna die  Because see they're living like  It's the 1800s  Of course  But his injury is such that  There's medicine  That they have to get  From the town  The town  So she's preparing  To go into the woods  The blind girl  Is gonna walk through the woods 
[02:02:00]  Because she's the best choice  Are you kidding me  And William Hurt  Gives a speech  To the other elders  Because they're like  Look you're risking  What we built here  This private thing  By sending her into the town  Where she may  Run into Sanford Meisner  So this is exactly  What's going on  And William Hurt  I took some of his  Monologue  To the other elders  The elders  And this is his bit  Of overacting atrocity  Right  Who do you think  Will continue this place  This life  Do you plan to live forever 
[02:02:30]  It is in them  That our future lies  It is in Ivy  And Lucius  That this  This way of life  Will continue  Yes I have risk  I hope I am  Always able to risk  Everything  For the Justin Wright cause  Yeah  That makes my skin  Crawl  And again  I can't blow the ending  But the fact is  That the whole movie  You think it's the 1800s  And then she crosses a fence 
[02:03:00]  And sees a park ranger  And you do realize  That they're living  In modern times  And by the way  There are no creatures  They're just red suits  That the elders keep  There's no creatures  No creatures  The elders have these  Red creature suits  And every once in a while  They throw them on  Just to scare  And go into the woods  And come out of the woods  Sometimes they come into  The actual village  Oh yeah  Scare them a little bit  Just to keep them  Under control  The elders  Hence religion and fear  In society everybody  Hence religion and fear  In society  He had a message  It certainly wasn't 
[02:03:30]  Good film writing  Hey do the elders  Know about the  Like  About the  What times they're living in  Oh yeah  They were  The elders  No  The elders were all  Crime victims in real life  So they decided to build  This peaceful crime  This perfect society  Perfect society  But what we learn is  Even a perfect society  Has a problem  And in this case  It was the retard guy  The writing and the directing  Yeah  So I hope  Any of you that thought  Went out to buy this DVD  I hope I ruined it for you  There's no creatures  There might be two scary moments 
[02:04:00]  The most horrifying part  Is when the credits roll  And you realize  You got suckered in  To buying this piece of garbage  It is horrendous  Everything he's done  Since the sixth sense  Has gotten progressively worse  But he's making a statement  About religion  And how religion  Controls a society  And how fear  Controls a society  Yes  From free thinking  Here's a statement  About religion he's making  You can strap this film  To your waist  And run onto a bus  In Tel Aviv  It is horrendous  The village  Stunk 
[02:04:30]  Now if you ask me  Not having seen the movie  But now having been  Told the plot  And everything  It sounds like  A Twilight Zone  Sounds like it could be  A Twilight Zone episode  But terribly done  And the writing was so weak  And the story was so weak  Had they thrown that twist  At the end  And it was well acted  And well done  And scary  It might have been  Because it sounds  Look on the outside  Not having seen the movie  It sounds like a good idea  It was a good idea  It actually sounds like  A good idea for a movie  Right  Atrocious 
[02:05:00]  I was livid  When I was  Do you understand  I went to go to bed last night  I took cough medicine  That makes me sleepy  Instead I said  Let me whack my bag one time  And then watch this  And I couldn't sleep  I was so aggravated  Wow  And I think the final  One of the final lines  Of the movie was  My darling  My blood  No  I don't know what that is either  And then  No 
[02:05:30]  No  Wrong thing  Oh I'm sorry  That's the end of another film  I really hope  That somebody out there  Was planning on buying  This DVD  And it's ruined  Really fast  Because a couple people  Want to defend the movie  Oh yeah  Jimmy  Eric from Nebraska  Eric  Of course  Hey how's it going guys  What's up Nebraska  Well you know  I've been listening to your show  Since October  Love the show  You know  But  I hate the show myself 
[02:06:00]  But thank you  I tell you  Jimmy  Maybe you should go out  And get a hooker  Because you should be  In a really pissed off mood  This morning  The Village is an awesome movie  Listen  First of all  You live in Nebraska  You just like it  Because with the 1800s  That looked like futuristic  And modern  To what you're used to out there  The movie  Stunk  Someone doesn't like  Wide open spaces  I love wide open spaces  Eric what did you like  About the movie  Well you know  I've watched all of  M. Night Shyamalan's work  And he's a hell of a writer 
[02:06:30]  In the sense  That he will drag you one way  And then give you  That plot twist at the end  Yeah like everybody else  In Hollywood does now  You go left  You go right  And there's the guy  In the middle  With no money going  What do you want from me  It stinks  It looks familiar  No not everybody  Can be wrong  And you know  You're a hell of a comedian  But apparently  You don't know shit  About acting  I know a lot about acting  And I know awful acting  Believe me  I like good actors  I'm disgusted that Jamie Foxx  Didn't win best actor  That he only won best actor  For a musical comedy  I know a lot about acting  You've come back 
[02:07:00]  And every once in a while  Hollywood will surprise you  And throw you a twist  Because I really thought  That Morgan Freeman  Was going to be the one  That died  Well you know  Now I know  I just wanted to  Send the movie a little bit here  And say hello to you guys  Dude  Maybe my words  Ain't worth much  And that's fine  But yeah  Alright Eric  Dude the village  Was atrocious  The twist  It cheated  The story was so weak  And all over the place  And boring  This cornball love story 
[02:07:30]  Between that dullard  Joaquin Phoenix  And this stupid blind broad  Who walks through the woods  And then Adrienne Brody  At the end  Escapes  Because he killed somebody  He tried to kill somebody  And then he puts on  The red monster suit  And she stands in front  Of an open hole  And then steps away  At the right moment  And Adrienne Brody  Brody runs and falls  And dies in the hole  The blind girl  Found the hole  In the woods  And knew to step away  So the retard  In the monster costume  And this idiot  From Nebraska  Is clawing up  Like it's Citizen Kane  It's stunk 
[02:08:00]  Alright Bob from Jacksonville  Wants to defend  The village as well  Go ahead Bob  Morning shit dicks  How you doing man  Home of the Superbowl  Hey Jimmy  Stick to comedy man  I thought the movie  It was a little frustrating  Through the middle of it  And toward the end  It just all came together  Man I love that movie  Yeah but you know  What it seems like to me  Again  Not having seen the movie  It seems like  A story like that  Where the end  Is the big twist  Yeah  That you gotta then  Fill up the entire movie 
[02:08:30]  With some type of story  Like you could have  Alright it's the 1800s  Monsters in the woods  At the end  We're gonna show you  It's not the 1800s  And go  Now you gotta fill it up  With what  A crappy love story  Was in there  See the whole  The whole thing  Was  Here's what he was  Trying to do  Here's what he was  Trying to do  He was rushing  He thought he had  This brilliant plot twist  And this amazing ending  So the whole film  Was basically built  To try to justify  This like thing  He probably envisioned  And it was crap  When you look at  The Sixth Sense  That was to me great 
[02:09:00]  It was a great movie  It was well written  It was believable  It caught me off guard  It blew me away  This was crap  I wanted to be blown away  And it made me physically ill  It could have been  A half hour Twilight Zone  Dude it was  The Twilight Zone  Would have done it better  They would have done it right  They would have known  How to act  Alright let's go to  Chris in New York  Chris go ahead  How you doing  Hey Chris  I went to the movie  Over the weekend  Actually I bought it  One of my friends  Recommended it to me  And after I was done  Watching it  I drove by his house 
[02:09:30]  And threw it out his window  Thank you  It was horrible  Dude I bought it too  I'm so aggravated  That's hilarious  Let's go to Johnny B  On Long Island  Johnny B  Hey what's up guys  Johnny B  Hi Kyle Obani  Hi Johnny B  Jimmy I gotta defend you  100%  I have never been to a movie  Where everybody in the movie theater  For opening night  Said wow  That sucked  Yeah that's what I got  When I went  Everyone was like  Around me going  I can't  What that's it  I gotta see it  Just to see how bad it is 
[02:10:00]  I'll loan you my DVD  Don't waste your time  Don't waste your time  And don't even bother  What do you think about  Seeing Napoleon Dynamite  Don't  Don't  I saw Napoleon Dynamite  You like  It was really weird  But it's funny  It's funny  It's a goofy movie  It doesn't really have  A real story to it  But the characters  Are kind of funny enough  That it carries it  Yeah  I think if you watched it  A few times  It's one of those movies  That if you watch a few times  You'll get certain parts of it  That really make you laugh  Yeah  Trevor in Jersey  Trevor 
[02:10:30]  Hey guys  Hey  The retard's parents  Crying at the end  After they found out  He was dead  Made up the whole rest  Of the movie for me  I thought that made  The whole movie  Why was it funny?  Yeah  You didn't laugh your ass off  I'm trying to remember  That Ivy killed a monster  In the woods  And the parents  Just started crying  Their eyes out  Well yeah  Because they knew  It was the retard  But by that point  Dude  I was crying with them  Because I had sat through it  It was horrible  How did they get around  How did they get around  Things like airplanes 
[02:11:00]  And stuff  Oh  They tried to cover that  There's a scene  This arrogant ass  Put himself in a scene  Because he thinks  He's Hitchcock  Yeah  He put himself in a scene  I forgot  He has to be in all his movies  And after they realize  That it's actually modern times  One of the park rangers  Is talking to his boss  And he's going like  Hey man look  You're only there  To guard the preserve  It's some kind of  Wildlife preserve  That we're a couple miles in  And we pay the planes off  Not to fly over  It was like  The cheapest tie in  Way out  Yeah  Dude it was such a cheap 
[02:11:30]  Like let's tie this loose end  Without any real thought into it  Yeah  It stunk  And the village itself  How big was it about  Oh a few houses  Five or six houses  Five or six houses  A little village  So it could have been  In there without being detected  Red was the bad color  Apparently the entire script  Was written in it  How many years  Have they been there  Well I guess  The people who started  You have to assume  These adult children  Have been there  Since childhood  Or whatever  Or adulthood  Maybe 20 years  20 years 
[02:12:00]  20 years  The elders  Came in 20 years  The elders  The elders  Alright one more  James from Connecticut  Then we'll move on  Go ahead James  Yeah I agree with you  Little Jimmy  That movie  Sucked  Sucked  My wife bought it  And it made a big thing about it  We're sitting in front of the TV  Surround sound  The best part was  When she fell in that hole  Yeah  It sucked  Dude I was so mad  I wanted to throw myself  In front of a train  Oh  To compare it to  The Twilight Zone  Oh you just killed  The Twilight Zone  That was way better 
[02:12:30]  Hey did you see  I tell you what  Blew me away  That I absolutely loved  And I thought  Was going to be overrated  I saw Ray  And I thought  That was phenomenal  I didn't expect to like it  I'm like  This will probably  Be blown out of proportion  But it was great man  It was horrible  But I agree with you  Does he die at the end  Alright thanks buddy  No but he actually  He actually like  Wings and says  I can see  I'm trying to move on  Another Hollywood twist  Yeah  I'm trying to move on  But there's one more here  Let's say hi to Eric  Go ahead Eric  Hi Owen A 
[02:13:00]  Love the show  How you doing Cuddle Bunny  Hey what's up Eric  I was just calling  Because  The one major plot point  That nobody's mentioned  So far in that movie  That sucked  Were those  Boxes of doom  That were in every one  Of the elders' houses  Oh yeah  The boxes of doom  They were hidden  They were not  Put out of sight  They were right in the middle  Of everybody's living room  What is it?  Well there were boxes  Of newspaper clippings  From their old lives  Like boxes of  You know  The atrocities  That happened to each elder 
[02:13:30]  Like in real life  Every one of them  Had a loved one murdered  Or something  And that's why  They all banded together  And created this little  Perfect society  There was no crime  Or real acting  Or any type of  Directing or writing  This little magical place  Where any twist you throw in  Is going to wrap the audience up  Into a new little package  Jim their own nirvana  Their own nirvana  Excellent point  They had these boxes  Out in plain sight  And it was just horrible  Because nobody even  Looked in the boxes  Yeah  And dude  They kept everything  Anyway  The movie sucked  I'm punching out 
[02:14:00]  It was just awful  And the monster costumes  Were horrible  Yeah what were they?  Well it was like  A red cloak  Because all you know  Monsters have red cloaks  Cloaks  And a big dumb monster face  And it looked like  It had thin branches  Coming out of its back  It was corny  And awful  I saw more believable  Monsters on Davy and Goliath  They were scarier  As claymation  Than these awful monsters were  Alright  Why don't we take a break  We get the point  A review of the village  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk 
[02:14:30]  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  Stunk  I remember that one  Ship goes up into space  Crashes on some planet  The astronauts  Kill each other off  Like  Or at least one of them  Is really crazed  And killing the other ones off  To get their water  And supplies  So he could live a little longer  And they're looking for any  Type of stuff to keep them alive  Water 
[02:15:00]  A lake  Something  And one guy climbs over the rim  Looks down and sees a telephone pole  And a road  And realizes they had  Crashed back on earth  And they weren't on a distant planet  So kind of  Kind of similar twist  Yeah  If you're going to put a twist at the end  You know  Just make it believable  Make sure  You know  It's  Stephen King talked about it  In Misery  Where Kathy Bates' biggest complaint  In the book  Was that he cheated  On one of the books  Like he cut to a different point  Without  At the logical progression  That's what this did  So you're saying 
[02:15:30]  He should be hobbled  I absolutely believe that  I hope that  M. M. Nightshall  Faces a hummel  In the wrong direction  Because actually  In the book  In the book  Stephen King  In the book  He wasn't hobbled  She took a hatchet  And chopped his foot off  And then blowtorched the wound  And she also cut off  One of his fingers  And put it in a birthday cake  And the book was great  Much better  Wonderful  Alright  That should happen to him  Except it should be his writing hand  Putting a cake  So next time he tries to type a twist 
[02:16:00]  You're a dumb Indian  And your movie's stunk  The Village  Part 2  Anthony now watches The Village  And thought it was good  Even though he knew the ending  Jimmy tears apart the movie  And it's plot again  That's what you're going to hear  On the worst of Opie and Anthony  Right now  The worst of Opie and Anthony  And do we have time to talk about  The movie you saw  In the hotel room  That you really really enjoyed 
[02:16:30]  I enjoyed it  We started this late in the show yesterday  Yeah  I enjoyed this movie  I watched it on the hotel  You know  Movie thing  It was  It was a good movie  I think if I didn't know the end  I would have really enjoyed it  But even not knowing the end  As it went on  And I was trying not to like it  Because other people  Were saying it was a bad movie  So when certain parts came up  And I was laughing  And then I realized  Why am I laughing  This is kind of a good movie  It was called The Village 
[02:17:00]  I watched The Village  He looked at the look  I was giving you a look  Anthony liked The Village  Jimmy  The movie you trashed  About a week and a half ago  On the program  I watched The Village  And I  If I didn't know the end  I probably would have been like  Oh my god  This movie is fantastic  But since I knew the end  I just  I was like  There is nothing wrong with this movie  It is a good movie  I thought  Okay  The acting 
[02:17:30]  Wasn't  Wasn't all that hot  But  The story  How it was presented  I had no problem with it  And then there was one part  Where  Joaquin  Is doing that thing  We've all been goofing on  I hadn't seen the movie  So I too was goofing on  The whispering thing  Where he's  Jimmy says that  He's such a bad actor  That instead of being dramatic  Or intense  He just whispers  Yeah  Why do I have to whisper 
[02:18:00]  Because I stink  So I'm laughing  When he's whispering  This scene comes up  And he's whispering  I'm like  Ah what a tool  I got my  Rah rah  Go Jimmy  Banner in one hand  My Jimmy this movie sucks hat  On my head  And I'm laughing at everything  And then I'm realizing  Wait a minute  He's whispering  Because he's on a porch  And people are sleeping  In the house inside  I know  I understood the reason  For it  I knew why in the scene  He was whispering  Okay  But I'm talking about  When somebody is expressing passion  And the only way they can do it 
[02:18:30]  Is not doing it like that  It was just  It was atrocious  I didn't see him  Expressing passion that way  I saw him whispering on the porch  And I saw him whispering  When he was trying to  Put a point across  That maybe wasn't  Going to be accepted  Around people  And it was kind of like  He had to keep it to himself  A little bit  That he wanted to do certain things  And then he would go into  That whisper thing  Which I did get a good chuckle  What was it that he had wanted to do  That he wanted to know  Finally take an acting class  That when they're sitting on the porch  And that cornball dialogue 
[02:19:00]  And she's going  He's going  She's going  Why can't you never speak things  That are on your mind  Why must you always speak  With him  It was horrendously written  It was even more poorly acted  It was terrible  I wanted to love that movie  When I saw it dude  I wanted to love it  I like him  I thought because it was  A period piece  Which it was  Yeah  A big bloody stain  On the front of a dress  That's exactly what it was  That stunk like copper and mushrooms  I didn't see it that way 
[02:19:30]  I saw it as a period piece  Which kind of  Was why the acting  I think was like that  Why it was presented like that  I don't know if the acting  Was so bad  Or if it was just  That's  You know  It's supposed to be  Kind of 1800s-ish  It was  But have you ever seen  Anthony Hopkins  Do 1800s  Have you ever seen  Gary Oldman  Do 1800s  They're guys that can act  If you're going to do 1800s  Do 1800s  But if you can't do 1800s  There's nothing worse 
[02:20:00]  Than  Why must I get a letter  It was just terrible  Okay  It was terrible  Didn't you find it a little weird  When the blind girl  Had to go to the village  Or whatever  To the town  Or whatever it was  To get the medicine  I did find that a little weird  But she did seem  To have a certain perception  That was above and beyond  Your normal blind person  And also  But she wouldn't be  The first choice  To go heading out  Into the woods  No  It obviously is the first choice  Because she was the one  That could have gone  Without seeing things  And taking it back  And saying  I saw a motor vehicle 
[02:20:30]  I saw these wonderful things  So she obviously  Was the best person  Suited to go  Because she wouldn't  Come back with the info  But meanwhile  They're sending a blind chick  Into the woods  Because they're all crime victims  And they're worried  About their families  So what do you do  Even though you know  That there's no monsters  You just send the blind girl  Aimlessly into the woods  Somewhere  And hope she finds the road  And then doesn't realize  That there's a car  Picking her up  And then just makes her way  Back over a fence  It's stunk  And he should be gutted for it  Everything  Dude everything  I didn't find it that bad 
[02:21:00]  And why didn't  One of the guys  That knew the whole scam  Go for the  For the medicine  Absolutely  One of the elders  One of the elders  That knew what this whole  Village was about  I know why  That's a good idea  Why?  Because he was too scared?  No they were just too heartbroken  What had happened in the world  So they couldn't bear to face it  So meanwhile  Send the blind girl  Through the woods  At three o'clock in the morning  She won't trip on anything  And catch her neck  In a branch  It was terrible  She had to go  Because she was in love  With the Joaquin  And she was the one 
[02:21:30]  And he had been stabbed  By  He had been stabbed  By  Adrian Brody  Right  Who should stab himself  After winning the Oscar  And then performing  In that hunk of shit  Well him  Did the little wacky costumes  Didn't throw you  That actual  Almost adult teenagers  Were scared by  The wacky costumes  Some douchey elder  Yelling boogaloo  Did they actually say boogaloo?  No  I might have had the sound down  Had they yelled boogaloo  It would have added more integrity  To the monster character  He's beating you up pretty good 
[02:22:00]  I understand  He's beating you up pretty good  I didn't find it that bad  I didn't mind the movie  I thought it was kind of  He had a little message in there  About how today  It's better to keep your society  In fear of something  To keep them in control  That was not his message  His message was  Your first film is always your best  And it's downhill after that  That was his message  I understood he tried to put a message in  But that annoyed me in a way  If a social message  Is organically inserted into a film  And it makes sense 
[02:22:30]  And when it's done  It's too cute  Or it's too forced  It insults my intelligence  And it makes me very angry  I thought  It makes me very angry  I thought it was  Not a bad movie at all  And I thought the double twist thing  You thought you had the twist  When you realized the elders  Were the ones that were  Dressing as the monster  But the twist is  That they weren't  Do we have any acting clips  From that though  Maybe now that you've seen it  You can even look at it in context  Any acting clips  We don't have that  We'll have to go back  To the acting clips  When we get to New York tomorrow  What happened to the potatoes 
[02:23:00]  I have no idea  What you're talking about  From O&A Pictures  You always like potatoes  That's not new  A horrifying story  Did you forget the potatoes  Of a man  I need the potatoes  Without potatoes  Danny you forget the potatoes  It won't happen again  I can promise you it  How far will one man go  Well I'm going to have to wait  For the potatoes  For potatoes  The potato diva  My potatoes are here  Come here  Open your mouth  Eat  Eat  Eat your potatoes  That's the way to do it  You say potato 
[02:23:30]  He says potato  That's a big thing  Of potatoes Danny  Everything is delicious  The potato diva  I need the potatoes  Yeah  Coming soon  I want potatoes  And I want eggs  And I want hot sauce  God you've gotten fat  XM 202  The O.P. and Anthony Show  Oh finally  We get to hear  Paul Field in studio again  This was one of my  Favorite segments  Paul Field  Thus far on XM  Satellite Radio  Anthony  This guy Paul and his wife  They absolutely killed

You're on the internet  For whatever it was back then 
[02:29:30]  We started talking  And he was calling me on the phone  And I guess we got into some pretty heavy phone sex  Why was he calling on the phone?  I was in England still  Yeah he was in England  It went from internet to talking on the phone  And your husband had no clue about this?  Yeah no he did  He did?  Yeah he knew  What did he say?  We were  He said I'm moving out see ya  No no he didn't say  Actually that's what I told him  He was oblivious  He didn't care  He didn't care  I mean that's why I was on the internet 
[02:30:00]  As long as the Mets were winning  He was fine  As long as the Mets were winning  That's all he cared about  Yeah right  The Mets were winning  Why are you naked with the other guy in the other room?  Really?  Oh believe me  And that's  Well that's gone on  Wait you were in the same house?  Actually for a while yeah  We had gotten back together  My husband and I for a while  And Paul came over to America  And he needed a place to stay  And he stayed with us  Wait wait wait wait  So he's at work  And I'm taking care of business  What was the excuse you gave him? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah  What did you tell the husband?  There's a lot going on  I know  I'm not getting as many details  I'm just throwing the news folder in the garbage  We won't be here  Believe me we have a story all of our own  Alright hold on  I got a better husband  Let's back up a little bit here  Alright  Let's get this  I want all the info  Message boards  Oh my god  Because you were looking for something else  Because you were miserable in your marriage  He's in London  Across the  I was bored  Across the pond  You're bored  But now did you tell your husband 
[02:31:00]  Hey I'm talking to this guy in England  Oh yeah  Yeah he knew  And he knew  And everything was fine  He didn't care  In fact a lot of times when he was over  I mean he would help me and the kids  And he'd walk us out the door  He didn't care  So I'm like fine  That's the way you want to be  It kind of didn't start off  You know  As a romance  It was a lot like a friendship  Well officially  Actually divorce is over  We can talk about it now  Can't we  Wait and then you started having phone sex  Oh yeah 
[02:31:30]  Oh god  Oh yeah  So you have the phone sex  Officially quitting my job now  Not going back there again  Everyone's sitting there listening to me  What kind of phone sex?  Hot  From England?  Oh yeah  Well hello  When you rub the phone on your twat  That must have been expensive  Oh no  No  A lot of heavy breathing  Heavy breathing going on  It was hot  Alright  Hot phone sex  And now  You're coming to America  Yeah  What was the excuse?  Like all of a sudden you just came to America  Me?  Well I came 
[02:32:00]  I'd been to America a couple of times before  But all of the women I'd like talked to  You know  That I'd been interested in  Turned out to be fucking blimps  Oh my god  So  You know  You know  You know how it works  Jimmy's on AOL  He knows  He's had a few knock on his door  And he knew  Some of the ones that he hung out with  Alright wait a minute  Some of them would have had to have been cut out of the house  You know what I'm saying?  You were coming to America just to meet some of the women you were talking to online?  Not just that  I've always wanted to come to the States  Because I'm not really big on the foreign languages  So I really wanted to come from England to somewhere  Yeah  And I spoke my language  And I'd really been interested in America 
[02:32:30]  And I came over here  So now  No no no no  American women were easier  That's what it is  Yeah well you know  The British accent seems to work pretty well  Where were you going to stay?  Well I was actually staying at a friend's house for a while  And you know  And then  And then  Just moved around a bit  But how did now  You go to  You have to go to your husband and say  Hey  Well they were separated  When I first called to them  They were actually separated  You left your husband  Yeah I left  No when we  When we first started talking  I was there  But I was looking 
[02:33:00]  And then  When we decided that we were going to hook up  You know  I moved out  Got my own place  Got your own place  Yeah and that's when he  You two hook up  It's no more phone sex  It's real sex  Yeah  And then you get back with your husband  Yeah  Why?  Why?  Good question  Because the rent was due  No  I could never work for it  And I couldn't provide  A little cash  Yeah right  You forgot the photo story  When I sent the photo  Because we didn't  Oh my god  We didn't know what each other looked like 
[02:33:30]  When we first started talking  And then  I believe I sent my picture first  Yeah you did  And then she changed the phone number  I mean  But her picture was hot  You know  I'm like wow  This is  I'm looking on the back  Thinking you know  This is going to be a cut out of a magazine  I'm getting here  You know  That was  That was the  2400 bps  150k download of a gif file  You know what I'm talking about  So it was taking forever  That was the longest hour and a half of my life  Okay I can see the top of her head now  Is it going to suddenly get wider? 
[02:34:00]  You're worried about what the bottom of the picture is going to look like  That's right  I'm like it's okay to the shoulders  Holy shit  Yeah I would look skinnier then  Crossing my fingers  Please  All these days alone in my room  And American  And so British women are just  Fucking hideous  Or just stuck up cunts  So you Americans go over there  And you think they're cool  But us British guys  There's only two kinds of English women  There's the good looking ones 
[02:34:30]  And the fat bitches that think they're good looking  And that's really it  Wow  There really is nothing else  Really  The men aren't too much to speak for either  And I brushed my teeth  Just to clear that one up for you  Right  I want to understand now  You got back with your husband  Okay yeah  For whatever reason  Why did you go back?  Well he moved in  I think actually  No no no  To tell you the truth  I think it actually was  Because he had nowhere to go  He had nowhere to go 
[02:35:00]  Yeah we had given up the place  Where you know  We were together  And he found himself  I guess kind of  Out on the streets  And said  And of course it was me  I mean you know  I'm a sucker  I took him back in  So now when you took him back in  It was more like a roommate  Than it was husband and wife  Yeah you know it was  And it was like that for a long time  So that's why you were able to bring  You were sleeping in the same bed  I was on the couch  Yeah well like I said  You were still living there?  We had two kids  Wait were you as husband and wife 
[02:35:30]  Yeah you were  Back together  Were you still having sex  Sleeping in the same bed?  Yeah  Whore  Fuck off  Here's a funny  There's nothing funnier  Than when I was there  And me and her  Would be on the computer  On the chat room  At night  And whatever days  He's trying to get laid  He'd stay up until about me  And I'd just sit there  Looking interested  Waiting for her to get up  Waiting for her to come to bed  So he can have some sex  Every other night  He'd be in bed  Sleeping at 10 o'clock  Oh man  Like wow  What does she call  Slash greater than sign mean? 
[02:36:00]  Oh brother  So you're still having sex with him  As you're  Now whatever he  Boyfriend or whatever  Is sleeping on the couch  Well actually  You were out and about  Your own time  So you were going out  Yeah he was going out  He wasn't always there  We're back together  You can sleep on the couch  As a friend  Right  Did the husband know  That you guys were involved  Or no?  I don't think he really  Realized that we did it  I don't think he really  Realized that we actually  Were together  We'd ever been together  I don't think he ever knew 
[02:36:30]  That we'd be together  Even though now  We'll probably deny it  But I mean  I remember  Before he came back in  Hiding in the shower  While he came over  To pick up the kids  Oh really?  Yeah we were  We were pretty bad  He comes over  To pick up the kids  You guys are I guess  Involved  Please don't let him  Need to go to the bathroom  Go what?  I mean  I'm standing in the bathtub  Oh  I'm standing in the bathtub  And he's like  You know  There's nobody here  You know  Just take the kids  See ya  Thanks for stopping by  Shit if he needs 
[02:37:00]  To take a piss  I'm fucked  You know  Or it dumps even worse  Because you've got to  Just sit there  And breathe behind the shower  That's right  Oh listen to him  Go  The funniest twist of it all  Is he's the world's  Biggest Howard Stern fan  So this is a big  Stab in the balls  For him  He's getting fucked over  On the OPN Andy show  Oof  Are you still in contact  With him?  Yeah  You know  Actually we are friends  Yeah we have  Two beautiful daughters  Together  I'm  You know  We're friends  Still friends  He's got his thing  I got mine

I don't know  She's married  He has two kids  Alright so  Are you guys married now?  Yeah  We've been married  We've been married  It'll be eight years  And you have a kid together?  Yeah  A little girl  Yep  Wow  In fact we have her  Actually  Our eight year old  Was a bridesmaid  At our wedding  And there's a twitch  Because the divorce  Didn't come through  Until after she popped  It's ironic  He wouldn't file  Or pay for the divorce 
[02:38:00]  But getting pregnant  And getting a $10,000  Medical bill  Pretty much kicks  The divorce into going  You know  Ah yeah  He didn't want to  Have to pay for that  He had to pay for it though  Because of the days  I was still under  His insurance though  Wait  Wow  You're under his insurance  Having a kid with  Oh my god  But the divorce  Was followed  Yeah  He'll slap her right  I would strangle someone  Someone's gotta be choked  Someone has to be dead  Someone just had to be choked  Wow  So you're banging  Your husband  He's on the couch  Were you banging  Both at the same time 
[02:38:30]  I'm not gonna say  Not in the same fucking bed  I refuse to incriminate myself  The divorce is over though  Yeah well  Oh no no  Once the divorce is true  I was banging him  Every chance I got  I hope you mean me  Yeah  Yeah  You think  Jimmy is totally quiet  Just staring at me  No  Well I've told Jimmy  Many of my little  Yeah I know a lot of that  I don't know all the  Different details  But I don't think she  Didn't know about this  No she's told me  Okay so anyway  On with the news  This is great  You're a class act  Yeah

I considered the cock.  We'll suck dick for friendship.  I don't want people looking at me shoving this hog in my mouth.  Why?  Don't take the whole penis in your mouth.  Why?  You're going to gag for sure.  Oh, gosh.  So you're going to perform oral sex on him?  Yes.  You can lick and kiss and suck and do whatever you like. 
[03:44:30]  I love him.  And do that up the shaft of the penis and along the side and around to his testicles.  And then you take just the head of his penis in your mouth.  That's all.  Open their mouth real wide and shove that in.  And you drill great quantities of saliva down the shaft of his penis.  What a great blowjob technique.  Holy crap.  Grip the penis very gently with your hand.  I think it made me a little butt sack.  And let him use the dildo. 
[03:45:00]  Put it in.  Pull it out.  How'd you like getting your shitter?  I like to lick ass.  This is great.  Not gay if you're single.  These two homos know a lot about sucking dick.
