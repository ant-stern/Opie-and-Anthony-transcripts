<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their hugely successful "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" promotion, where women flashed their breasts on-air to listeners displaying "WOW" stickers.  They bragged about its originality and the imitations springing up on other stations.  This led into a recounting of their ongoing feud with WBCN's Rocco and Matty, detailing pranks and listener-led disruptions of Rocco's appearances.  The hosts described their retaliatory promotions and read emails from listeners enthusiastic about the "battle."  Jim Norton was in studio throughout much of this segment.  The segment also included listener calls, discussion of a negative 20/20 segment about the show, and mentions of upcoming guest appearances by Bad Ronald (who later played their song, "Wow, Whip Them Out Wednesdays").  Commercial breaks and phone issues punctuated the segment.  The entire segment was rife with offensive language and sexually suggestive material.

The show continued with a spirited defense of their controversial content.  This included a discussion of FCC guidelines and a lack of legal restrictions on offensive speech, followed by a misogynistic tirade against "worthless soccer moms" who criticized their show.  They further detailed "Whip It Out Wednesday," and recounted the story of "Lola," a listener who came to the studio to be "honeyed and feathered" for Backstreet Boys tickets.  Their contentious relationship with NOW and other feminist groups was also highlighted, with derogatory comments made about Ruth Baird Smith. A phone call with Tim Sabian, a program director, introduced the bizarre story of a friend wanting to advertise a pill that alters the taste of bodily fluids.  This led to an extended, increasingly suggestive discussion of the pill. The hosts also discussed their upcoming appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), where they planned to interview celebrities with Lady Di and Marion. Guests during this segment included Billy Mack, Tim Sabian, Steve, Alex (a NOW member), Brian, and Andy.

The next segment began with a call from Scorch of "Totally Nude Radio," who detailed his own show, including a failed attempt to book Deirdre Hall and upcoming segments featuring a dog breed expert for pick-up advice and a 66-minute sex tape.  After a brief disconnect, Scorch called back.  This transitioned into a lengthy, argumentative conversation with Marion, one of their planned VMA interviewers, about her late arrival time (5 pm) for the interviews.  Lady Di's scheduling conflicts, due to her government job, were also discussed.  The hosts then interviewed Phil Kogan from *The Amazing Race*, discussing the show's challenges and contestants, with some jabs at Debbie, the publicist.  Listener comments included a humorous observation about *The Amazing Race* being Marion's last chromosome trying to catch up.

The show concluded with a segment featuring numerous listener calls sharing their "what I learned today" takeaways.  These ranged from humorous observations (like suggesting the rectory should be a gay bar, and implying a connection between Britney Spears and Lady Di) to crude sexual humor, jokes about disabilities (using the word "retards"), and offensive stereotypes.  Anthony referred to his penis as "the rooster," and Norton called his a "hivleaker."  Callers (including Jersey Gary, Jim from Philly, Ernie L from Jersey, Uncle John, Phil from Philly, Joe from Garden City, and Greg) shared their anecdotes,  including one about picking up women by walking a dog in Central Park.  The hosts riffed on these contributions.  The segment concluded with promotional announcements for Jim Brewer's show.  The entire broadcast was characterized by frequent use of offensive language and sexually explicit content.

There's a lot of people emailing us lately  Saying, you know, these idiots  You guys are idiots  You think it's the greatest radio promotion ever?

Oh, yeah, I'd be long gone  Long gone  So, it is the greatest radio promotion ever  Yes  It's so great that everyone else is doing it now  Uh-huh  In other forms  They just try to call it other things  They call it other things  But they do try to incorporate the day of the week in there 
[00:05:30]  Right  How could we relate to boobs to the T of Tuesday?  Well, we can't use that word  You know, I mean  We don't talk about them often  But, you know, Howard is so right  The business is filled with a bunch of douchebags  Yes  And it's like, you know  As far as we're concerned with this WOW thing  There are guys  You know, we started about six or seven years ago now  Maybe six summers ago  And there are guys all over the country doing it  Yeah  And thinking that, you know  Oh, those guys will never get syndicated  They'll never get national press 
[00:06:00]  Yeah  There's two guys in San Jose, Lamont and Tonelli  Yeah  Claiming they invented WOW  And they're hoping it's going to, you know  Sweep the nation someday  That's funny  And now we're all over 2020 downtown  And all these national interviews  Yeah  Proving to everyone that  Yes, indeed, we came up with this lovely idea  About six or seven years ago  Yes  We have documented proof  Of course  Articles from the old days  Just enjoy it  They must feel like complete idiots  To their listeners at this point 
[00:06:30]  They won't acknowledge it  Yeah, but the listeners aren't stupid  The guys they've been listening to for so long  Telling them that they invented this WOW  And all of a sudden we're on TV  Yeah  2020  And admitting to the world how we came up with it  That's why I came up with Ass Whipping Wednesday  Cool  You want to start with that?  We can start with that  Where's the Boston stuff?  Let's do that  Get that out of the way  You know, because  Where do we start? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time  Talking about Boston  Because that's where Ant and I made our names  And then we got fired  You know the story by now  Yeah, it's our first city that we really have a grudge  We really hold a grudge in  Right  We have a battle  To  We have a battle  In Boston  Right  To win  Oh yeah  Now the other cities  We do love you too  Oh yeah  But let me tell you something  We have a personal vendetta  In Boston  I was starting to think 
[00:07:30]  Like a lot of listeners  Especially  I think the New York listeners  Really understand how important this is to us  Yeah  When I say New York listeners  You know the New York area  Maybe the other cities  They just don't understand how important it is  That we're going back into Boston  To kick the ass of the station  That fired us  Right  Okay  And I thought we maybe were spending a little too much time  On the Boston little cute war  That we're already winning by the way  Oh yeah  I got an email from a fine couple in Seattle, Washington 
[00:08:00]  Seattle, Washington  And they listen on  I forgot what station we're on  Extreme Talk  But we love you  We love you  What's in the name of a station?  Right  As long as  Hey help me out  I'm like Rain Man when it comes to stuff  I had a little brain fart  I know you did  Okay  And the email was talking about  How they're enjoying the Boston abuse 
[00:08:30]  Yeah  And this lady's husband  Is going around the house  Imitating us  Imitating  Rocco  Schlocko  The guy who took our place after we got fired  And never looked back  Right  That's when I thought to myself  These people are really digging  The fact that we're  You know  I mean isn't it fun  To just walk around going  Hey  Dave  Come here  Tell me what to do  Come on  It's fun  Hey what's going on  It's Rocco  I mean if you've got a guy in Seattle 
[00:09:00]  Who has no clue who Rocco is  Yeah  Imitating how  How much of a loser he is  Yeah  I'm thinking that  People are enjoying this little battle  We're having with our old station  You know what I noticed too  I  I'm a  I'm a fan of their website up there  And  At AF  So I visited a lot to check out where their personal appearances are going to be  Right  It's like a playbook you tool  And for some reason  I haven't seen Rocco 
[00:09:30]  Well Opie he's not going to be out and about the whole month of September  Could that have something to do with the attack at the blood drive  I think maybe the Godsmack show that they had at the Twitter center might have been a problem too  Yeah it's something we didn't even bring up on the air  We take notice of everything  We want to thank our listeners in the Boston area  Chanting our names as Schlocko is on stage with his little band Godsmack  He actually had to  He actually had to like leave the stage in disgust 
[00:10:00]  I heard he got all pissed off  And started having to talk back to the audience  That's bad  You should just continue what you're doing  Get off the stage  You don't want to talk back to our audience  No  It's just going to make them madder  No  Don't do that  We're telling you guys  Don't piss off our listeners  So he  So get this  He's not going out  Right  The whole month of September  He's not doing any remotes or anything like that  And his butt buddy there 
[00:10:30]  His sidekick  Matty  Who used to play disco  Before he teamed up a lot ago  And I hate to even call him a comedian  You know we have comedians on here  Norton and Voss and what not  But this guy I guess he calls himself a comedian  And on his little website  There were all the appearances at various comedy clubs around Boston  That he was going to be in  That seems to have disappeared too  Completely  Now why wouldn't they want to put up a website  Telling where Rocco and Matty are going to be 
[00:11:00]  I don't know Anthony  Oh Pussas  That's why  Petrified  That the masses  The soldiers of the Opie and Anthony army  Oh Pussas  Right  Will come out and disrupt it  And you know what  You won't be able to do anything  And you know why  Because Dave Dickless told you not to do anything  He won't say anything  He won't respond  He won't  He won't try to battle  Because Dave has told him  Right  No don't  Don't talk about him 
[00:11:30]  Don't do anything  Right  Alright  Just sit there and die the slow death  Die  Ass whipping Wednesday  Go to my website  And see your half naked men  Getting whipped  What is that about  I wonder which one of them  Rocco or Matty  Turns to the guy that walks in for ass whipping Wednesday  And says  Take your clothes off  Hey dude  Take your clothes off  Yeah  Yeah  You're wearing one of them teabags

[00:12:30]  And I say start because it is just the beginning  Oh yeah  Payback is a bitch  We don't let up  We don't forget  We don't move on  No  This is a battle that was years in the making  Right  And we are so happy  That we're up there now kicking your ass  And I want to say hi to the troops that relocated from the New York area to Boston for college  Yeah  What's up troops?

[00:36:30]  I mean they really kind of made you guys look inarticulate  And I know that you're not  I mean you said something  You know like  Not us we are too  You know I heard your rant before Anthony  When you're  I think she was going to compliment me Opie  I'm sorry  Do you really need a compliment that bad today  I'm not  I'll get her right  Not from Sarah  Not from Sarah  She's out of her mind  That's crazy  Sarah  No it's Sarah  Hey drunk  Alright  Enough  Don't talk about that  When is the O'Reilly piece going to air? 
[00:37:00]  Does anyone know?  She said sometime later this month  Alright  We can't get Tim on the phone?  Tim's in an important meeting and he's going to call us when he's out  Oh boy  Yeah right  I swear  Yeah right  Alright  Well why don't we play some of the 2020 piece Ant  Yeah let's see how fair they are  This aired while we were on vacation  We you know  They snuck it  They snuck it on the airwaves  So we couldn't comment on it right after it happened  So yeah we've lost our bang 
[00:37:30]  Now that it's out there a week or so  Yeah  But here we go  We'll stop it from time to time  Okay  Yes  From Times Square  In New York  John Quinones  Who?  Who?  Good evening  I'm glad you could make it downtown  Good evening  I'm glad you could make it downtown  Good evening  Who talks like that?  Come on  Good evening 
[00:38:00]  Honey  I'm home  Good evening  Good evening  Honey  I like  Some  Pork chops  And mashed potatoes  This evening  Tonight  Four stories with a common edge  Law and disorder  Law and disorder  Law and disorder  No wait wait  It's opposed to law and order  I get it  That's it Norton  I love a clever spin  Schmucks  Law and disorder  Law and disorder 
[00:38:30]  From a southern  Tonight law and disorder  Lily  Grandpa  Let's hear him  From a southern sheriff  Who is part bully  Part celebrity  To a place where you can smoke  As much pot as you want  Legally  Legally  Oh  I thought they were talking about  Our stairwell  Yes  Oh that's  Stinky 
[00:39:00]  That's just a joke  For the radio  We wouldn't do something  As illegal  As that  Something illegal  As legal  No gambling in Bushwood  Sir  We start in the world  Of shock radio  Wildly popular programs  Full of foul language  And scandalous stunts  They're outrageous  They're often offensive  But are they  Against the law  Yes  And should be killed  Against the law  This is legal  Isn't it  Yes Rick 
[00:39:30]  Can they stop  With the shock radio  Can they stop  This is shocking  I think if we had  A button  That we could push  That would send  A sonic wave  Out through the radio  That would make  People's heads explode  Maybe they should  Look into that  That would be a little  Shocking  That would be a little  Shocking  If all of a sudden  You walk and  Someone's got their  Walkman headphones on  And their head explodes  Shocking  I would even say  We'd be shocking  If we had the power  To do that  Hey I was listening  To Z100  Next thing I know  My head exploded 
[00:40:00]  I was walking right next  To his brains  All over my head  That was pretty shocking  Talking about boobies  I better call  2020 downtown  They gotta do a piece  On this  You know what would be shocking  If you listen to Z100  And they were interesting  That would be shocking  Shocking  You know how gay  Z100 was today  Because I was flipping  Around like crazy  I drove in today  If you live in another city  Just pick the gayest  Station in your city  That's the one  We're talking about here  That plays the same  Ten pop songs  Over and over again  All day long 
[00:40:30]  NSYNC  And the DJs  Get to talk for a total  Of two and a half minutes  Per show  Nice  I can't listen to the Yankees  Because of them  I was listening to them  On the afternoon one time  And somebody said something  Oh they won  It's okay  I haven't listened all year  They win  Because it was an unfunny remark  And it was so bad  I punched my radio  I feel like  Stink  And I cannot get AM anymore  I'm stuck in FM  For about a year and a half  It's true  I can't listen to the Yankees  Because they have no humor  That happens though  Sometimes  You get so mad  You ever punch your radio 
[00:41:00]  In your car  Yes  I've done that  Yeah  I'm sure people have done it  Through this very program  Christina now  Yeah I like  She's a friend of mine  Her I like  But I'm not up at the hour  So I'm listening to Z100  And their big bit today  Yeah  They're teasing that  They get ready for this  Let me get the wacky alert horn  They have the latest  Britney Spears tune  And no one else has it  But they don't want to get in trouble  With the bosses  So they're only going to give you  A little piece  Hey he's ripping me off 
[00:41:30]  That's funny  I actually heard him say  Hey we got it  And we're not supposed to play it  But I'll give you a little taste  You want to let him in on that little secret Opie  Yeah go ahead  What they have is only what you heard  A piece of the song  See they don't have the whole song  So they say  We'll give you a piece of it  Because that's all they have  They have a little CD  And it's just a piece of it  That's all that they got from either  Somebody at the record company 
[00:42:00]  Or they pull it off the internet  Or something  We're the mass radio duo  Yeah  We wear masks to disguise ourselves  And we give away all the radio tricks  Oh like the magician  Right  Did on that fox show  Here's how this trick worked  You gotta respect them though man  The bosses said no  And they did it anyway  What balls  Yeah  Wow  It's pretty dangerous  Some dangerous  No  I'd have more respect for them  If they just had a small dose  Of smallpox  Give it to the first winner  So they played 15 seconds 
[00:42:30]  That's all we can do  I don't want to lose my job  Oh we got benefits here  Just a piece  All right  How come just your piece  Faded out at the end  That's the way it was recorded  Shut up  I'll teach everyone  Another little radio trick  A little secret  When a really hot song comes out  Let's say  Let's say Alice in Chains  Never Gonna Happen  Gets back together  And they got a single  Yeah  And the radio companies  Will sneak it to some 
[00:43:00]  High profile stations  But they can't directly  Hand it to the program director  Wait the record companies  Give it to radio stations  High profile  They leak it  They call it leaking it  Because like the  You know the day that  Everyone else is allowed  To play it is  Let's say Friday  Yeah  But they want to get it out there  They want to leak it a little bit  It's Wednesday  Two days before right  They don't hand it  To the program director  Because a lot of people  Would be pissed off  But all of a sudden  They'll just kind of make hints  Where that radio station  Could find the latest song  From Alice in Chains  Outside the building 
[00:43:30]  Oh like in the bushes  Or something  They bury it in the bushes  Yeah  Interesting  And then the station  You go  Oh you know  I don't know  How it got in my hands  But look what I got  What is with this  Aldrich Ames crap  Just give them the song  And let them play it  It's a worm  All right  Back to the 2020 piece  When we come back  You won't believe your ears  They're a very important music  Very very important story 
[00:44:00]  When we come back  When we come back  You won't believe what you hear  Friggin' fag  You want to make out or something  No not that  We were appalled  But we're going to exploit it  On our program  To get higher ratings  It's so awful  When it first aired  We're going to air it here  Again  During Sweep  During Sweep's week  They're all holier than thou  About this stuff 
[00:44:30]  Yet they love broadcasting it  They love doing shows about it  Ah Mike what's going on  Oh man  Hey  What's up  What's up man  You want to hear what Z100's doing  For their morning show today  Again for everyone else  Insert your faggiest station  In your city  Where he says Z100  Right here  Go ahead  They're doing  Shut up  They're doing this contest  Called name your member  In the month of September  Where chicks got to name their boobs  Or guys got to name their schlongs  Stupid stuff like that

[00:48:30]  10th floor?  Alright  Put 10th floor on the address  Whatever  Back to the 2020 downtown piece  Yes  Okay  We didn't really play much of it  No we didn't  So I'm told you  It's going to take forever  To get there  Uh oh  Is that Tim Sabian?  Because I have to talk to him too  No?  Okay  Alright  Back to  2020  No Joe  Here now  Allison Stewart  Move over Rush Limbaugh  And get out of the way  Dr. Laura 
[00:49:00]  Talk radio has a whole new  Chorus of voices  Who really aren't that interested  In solving moral dilemmas  Or debating the cultural wars  Hey  This new generation of talk show hosts  Dishes about  The size of a woman's breasts  Or bodily functions  You may find what they have to say  Offensive  Or insulting  Or demeaning  But someone else may find it entertaining  The Federal Communications Commission  Is threatening to get tough  With these talkers  But some First Amendment backers contend  It is their right  To say almost anything 
[00:49:30]  On the radio  What's on your bed?  Satin sheets  Satin sheets  Burgundy  You go  Some people call it  You go  You go girl  You go  Could they segue that in  With the talk to the hand clip?  No  They totally got me  Out of context  I was saying  You go  Which means you're a goer  You go  I was like  This girl goes  You know what I mean?  You got satin sheets  You go girl  Talk to the hand  You're going  You crack 
[00:50:00]  By the way  You ever get those satin sheets?  Uh no  I got them on my bed  Right now  They're a pain in the ass  You slide all over  Everything satin  The satin pillowcases  The satin sheet  The satin  But the worst part  The big satin comforter  It's like trying to pull  A puddle of mercury  Onto yourself  The second  Like four inches of it  Goes off the edge of the bed  The whole thing goes  It makes that sound  It's like the siphon principle 
[00:50:30]  It's just like  Everything flies off the bed  Look we're having a cute little discussion  About satin sheets  Not about the size of a woman's boobs  Yeah exactly  This is fun  And kids can listen to it  Right until we get to the part  Where the big splooge puddle's  In the middle of it  Which is nice on satin  Because it slides right off  You can squeegee your bed clean  I love when they talk about our show  And they basically try to make it out  To be a show just about sex  Yeah  That's not true 
[00:51:00]  How does she think she has her job?  All right hold on  I gotta hear Anthony go  You go  Hold on  You go girlfriend  What's on your bed?  Satin sheets  Satin sheets  Burgundy  You go  You go  It's like a Ricky Lake  You go girlfriend  Anthony who brought you  Your satin sheets  It was my baby's father  Uh huh  My baby's father  He got benefits 
[00:51:30]  I don't care  My man says I look fat in this  But I know I look good  You get  My rank  You getting your freak on  I get my  My rank  I'll tell you one thing  They're not as absorbent  You need sheets with a little absorbency  Because who wants to get up?  You just want to wipe off on the sheet  It's my sheet  It's a slip and slide  Although it is easier to get them off the bed  When you're done  Just nudge  And slide onto the floor 
[00:52:00]  All right  Sleep on the floor  We're never going to get through this stupid piece  Some people call it hot talk  But I love the dirty talk  Some call it FM talk  I am traditional  I stand to pee and sit and do the other  Whatever you call it  It's certainly not your father's talk radio  My friends  You're a douche  Hey  People of my generation don't know how to find  Some old crusty guy on the AM radio  And floundering FM music stations  See this as an opportunity to attract a young audience 
[00:52:30]  In the past two years  Several major market stations  In a desperate search for ratings  Have ditched the tunes for talk  Beautiful butt  And the talk is racy and raw at times  In spite of much publicized guidelines for radio  That the Federal Communications Commission released last April  The agency is charged with keeping indecent language off the air  Between 6 AM and 10 PM  What does not have the right to exist all the time  Is speech that is indecent 
[00:53:00]  Or certainly obscene or pornographic  Private attorney Jay Sekulow has argued in favor of free speech rights  Nine times before the Supreme Court  Still he contends there are limits to what can be broadcast  In the name of entertainment  Pure entertainment in someone's view  May be obscenity in somebody else's  This new FM format takes talk to the edge  Relying heavily on a new type of talent  Young, brash, and unapologetic  I don't give a rat  Pushing the social and legal boundaries of speech  That rectory should be like a gay bar 
[00:53:30]  Well, alright  The rectory should be like a gay bar  Almost as good as your Olsen twins quote in Time Magazine  Look, I was probably reacting to yet another story of priests molesting boys  Doesn't mean all priests are doing it  You know what?  I just commented on the rectory being like a gay bar 
[00:54:00]  No surprise that what ABC did with us  Yeah, I'm very disappointed though  Of course they call it racy  That's really racy  Meanwhile, on the news every night  They show you footage of people being killed by gunshot wounds  Yeah  Murdered children  They should all drop dead  That's not racy  No, that's news  Oh, there's other things in this that are just like ridiculous  When you talk to these old crow women  That just do not understand this program  And shouldn't be listening to it 
[00:54:30]  You know?  You know what would make me happy?  The only thing that would really make this worthwhile  Is if somebody opened fire in their school  And started screaming out  Wow, wow  And they were murdering their classmates  Drop dead with your kids  I'm sick of hearing it  Damn kids, right?  That's all it's about  It took ABC about three months to convince us to do this piece  Yeah  And Porsche, if I ever see you  I swear to God  I'm going to punch you in the middle of your forehead  You douche  I hope you're proud of yourself 
[00:55:00]  It's always about  They use the children  Portia was the executive producer on this piece  Yeah  What's her name?  Portia  Well, how long did she strip before getting into those five bucks?  It does sound like a stripper name  Of course it does  And these are my friends, Lexus  This whole piece was about going after radio shows like us, Anthony  Yeah  And that's not how they sold it to us  You know, it's a whole thing about the FCC and all that crap 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, it was supposed to be  Hey, we want to do a piece on the Opie and Anthony show  Well, we knew it wasn't going to be a fluff piece  Yeah  We knew there was going to be some tough questions  But this, they had a whole different agenda  And she lied right to my face  And I hope you can sleep at night with that  I'm sure they can  Of course you can  That's all they do  Despicable things  And there's a media blackout on a trial  They scream, oh, we have the right to talk about it  We have the right  They cry about freedom of speech and freedom of press  Right  When there's a media blackout  But, you know, when it's FCC stuff, you guys can't say what you want  I hope she dies in a bus wreck  No, even worse  Oh, we were able to say what we wanted 
[00:56:00]  They interviewed us for over two and a half hours  Yeah  But then they decided what they were going to use for the piece  The edits are always going to kill you  We explained the FCC  We explained how we understand the FCC  None of that's in there  Yeah  Because it wasn't going to help their little piece  About how this type of radio is out of control  Yeah, it's got to be stopped  Because of the children  We explained how we sit down with lawyers on a daily basis  To make sure we're within our guidelines 
[00:56:30]  All that crap  They didn't use any of it  We're not going to sit here and say what we do  A lot of times  We won't offend people  Of course it will  But offending people isn't against the rules  Dick  Who am I talking to?  I was just trying  I'm like calling someone a dick  Sorry, Rocco  I had no idea who I was calling a dick  You know what?  Because you're doing it in humor  Whenever it's in humor  People have a problem  When you do an AIDS joke  You're a criminal 
[00:57:00]  Tom Hanks plays an AIDS patient  He gets an Oscar for it  It's graceful  You can exploit it  Just not with humor  I guess Portia needs a paycheck that bad  Oh, God  She should be just diagnosed with something awful  Hope you're proud of yourself  Nah, you know, I'm with Norton today, man  You know  We knew it wasn't going to be a fluff piece  But they used us  What is shocking about it?  Are people writing Al Pacino letters?  Are you really a Cuban drug dealer?  No, stupid  It's entertainment  All right  People can't separate it 
[00:57:30]  Let's go back to the piece  Shocking  Young, brash, and unapologetic  Oh, they also promised us  That we wouldn't be lumped in  With a man-douche in Chicago  Yeah  Remember that, Portia?  Remember when I said  We don't want anything to do with man-cow?  Yeah  Yeah  Remember that?  And we said  If it's going to be a piece  Where we're featured with man-cow  Then go find some other idiots  Oh, yeah  You do remember that  Portia  Well, I want to just talk about  The kind of radio I do  What the hell is that voice? 
[00:58:00]  He's part of the morning zoo, John  There's nothing innovative  With what he's doing  And that's why we didn't want to be lumped  Because he does more fake radio  Yeah  Well, let's hear the rest  Young, brash, and unapologetic  I don't give a rat  Pushing the social and legal boundaries of speech 
[00:58:30]  That rectory should be like a gay bar  The current it boys of FM Talk  Are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony  We just go on the air  And fly by the seat of our pants  And sometimes it's clever and funny  And other times it's downright disgusting and offensive  There you go  Yeah, but  Within every guideline  But within our guidelines  The FCC guidelines  What happened to that part?  There's no law against offensive  There is absolutely no law out there 
[00:59:00]  That says you can't do something that's tasteless  You can't talk about things that people don't want to hear  There are some guidelines that we have to adhere to  But there's no rules that say you can't talk about something  That someone's going to go  Oh my God  I don't want to hear that  Sorry  Change the dial  Is what we say  They won't change the dial  People want to listen and become obsessively annoyed  Because it gives them a cause  Because they're empty  And they should die of brain cancer  People are stuck 
[00:59:30]  They really are  Worthless little soccer moms  And they're trying to get rid of this type of radio  They're trying  They have no idea how many people are really, really enjoying this  Yeah  Just their little pot bellies  And their short hair  And their minivans  How great is it  When you hear of a minivan  Just being hit by a drunken dump truck driver  And flames killing everyone  Let me tell you something  That little rant was within the FCC guidelines 
[01:00:00]  Exactly  Might offend some people  Hell yeah  But who cares  See we understand the rules  You know the moms with their super cut hairdos  Super cut  Short fat pot bellies  They're super cuts too  You just got to add an N in there somewhere  Oh that's hilarious  Alright let's move on here  Here we go  Opie  A childhood nickname  Of former rock DJ Greg Hughes 
[01:00:30]  And Anthony Cumia  A former air conditioning duct installer  Are 30 some  A wheel man  I was a second story man  The former air conditioning duct work  Heating  AC ventilation guy  You could have just said tin knocker  Hey by the way  Because I know she's probably listening  I have no problem with Alison Stewart  None whatsoever  I like the many faces of Alison Stewart  There's the hot Alison Stewart that interviewed us 
[01:01:00]  Looking very nice  Loose more like the MTV Alison Stewart we remember  And then there was the school marm Alison Stewart  Interviewing the FCC woman  With the glasses on  And the hair pulled back  With her little smart outfit  Still looking hot  Don't get me wrong  But the glasses were on too  Right  Looking  Always looking good  Hold on  Billy Mack wants in  Billy Mack  Hey guys  How are you?  What's up Billy?  What's up Billy?  I take major offense to Norton's comment about minivans 
[01:01:30]  Why the hell are you driving a minivan?  Well first of all  When the Voyager bus happened  I was down there to pick him up  With Lewis Black  In your minivan?  In your minivan  I have a minivan  With the Danfields  I love you  I don't care what you drive  You're actually probably the guy  That would smash into the minivan  I know you've been in it  I'm not sure if you have  But anyway  Don't be so critical man  I just love how they're trying to make the minivans look cool 
[01:02:00]  Well you're not a soccer mom either Billy  That's a different thing  With the WOW sticker on the back  You know  Exactly  I can see you committing a felony in the van  I mean that's why it's okay for you to have it  Alright  Keep that a little secret  Bye bye  I love Billy Mack  Alright let me  Tim  What?  Tim Sabian  What's up?  Welcome back  There he is  I have to ask you something  But we're in the middle of our little 2020 downtown rant  Okay  Are you going to be around in 10 minutes?  Absolutely  I went to lunch with Ken today 
[01:02:30]  And I got to ask you if something's true that he was telling me  Alright?  Oh now what?  Is Ken one of your gay friends from the 2020 piece?  Our own GM Ken Stevens?  No?  I was wondering  I told Ken I like him or I would have said it on the air  Can you imagine?  Oh God  Wait until we get to that part and we'll explain it  Alright  Is this going to embarrass me?  No not at all  No see you think it's always about you Tim  I was just talking about Ken Stevens  Oh  It's not always about Tim Sabian and WYSP in Philly 
[01:03:00]  It's all about YSP in Philly  Alright we're going to call you in a few minutes  Alright?  Alright you guys  Alright thanks  Alright  Okay back to the 2020 piece  Opie  A childhood nickname of former Rocky J. Greg Hughes  And Anthony Cumia  A former air conditioning duct installer  Are 30 somethings who spend four outrageous hours a day  Male bonding with their audience  Why do these guys like your show?  I mean they have a lot of options  It's just a bunch of guys hanging out  And you know guys can relate to that  That's why they like it  You know they feel like they're a part of something  You know 
[01:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony fraternity or whatever  This is the debauchery  The stuff that they  You know sometimes  A lot of guys we know  They can't go out to strip clubs  They're not allowed  They're not allowed to have a porno movie in their house  Their show on WNEW in New York  Is the number one program  With a coveted demographic of men  18 to 49  Attracting advertisers  Selling everything from beer to cars  Opie and Anthony recently made headlines  With a lucrative syndication deal  That will take them into 19 of the top radio markets 
[01:04:00]  And they didn't get there  By just telling the time and temperature  And you're naked already?  Uh I still got underwear on  Well I think you should lose that  Yeah you gotta take those off to play the game  It's just delivering the rule  By the way did you say debauchery?  Debauchery  That really bugged me  Yeah I bet  Gosh darn it  Debauchery  Debauchery  You don't like debauchery?  I thought that was one of the  Yeah debauchery  Debauchery  Debauchery  All right  You sound like a deaf man 
[01:04:30]  Debauchery  I won't believe I like what I'm hearing on the radio  All I hear is  Whoosh  Deaf people will be bitching about our show  And then we have the theme song of  What's in my pants  It made national TV  It's time to play  Hey guess what's in my pants  What is the game  It did  That's nice  What is the game  Guess what's in my pants  Get women to call us from their little bedrooms 
[01:05:00]  And rub phones on their private area  This devoted listener  A 24 year old called  Now when they say this devoted listener  It's Lola  Yeah  Who came in to get tar and feathered  Oh yeah they were here for that  This devoted listener  A 24 year old calling herself Lola  Left any sort of guessing behind  When she showed up at the studio  To be honeyed and feathered  For a game called  Mommy  What would you do for Backstreet Boys tickets  First the honey  You gotta turn that fan on 
[01:05:30]  And let the feathers go  And then the feathers  And who did you do this for?  I did it for my little sister  So I could get her concert tickets  But I also had a little incentive of my own  Like having all my friends hear  Me do this wacky stunt  And her friends can see her too  And so can everyone else  Because digital pictures of stunts like this  Appear immediately on the station's website  Uh not anymore  Wrong talking dumbass  What do you mean not anymore?  What do you mean? 
[01:06:00]  Station got a little freaked out by that comment  And like deleted everything  Any W did?  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  All stuff within the FCC guidelines  That were on the website  Well how about the other one?  That's ridiculous  How about Foundry?  Foundrymusic.com  Still a bastion of smut  Good  And then go there  Let any W's website not have the pictures  Go to Foundry  Good  That's smart  Well foundrymusic.com is an underground website  No real affiliation with this radio show  So yeah  Go there  And see all the  Debauchery  Or is it debauchery? 
[01:06:30]  Debauchery  Debauchery  Debauchery  Three rights make a left  Now this is the website to have  Because they can't really control that  It's Foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  Foundrymusic.com  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com  Hi Steve  Let's go back to the piece  It's the kind of stuff  The sensational stuff  That people enjoy  Yeah I get off 
[01:07:00]  Knowing people  You what?  I get off  Knowing men are listening  To me  That was creepy  Don't start that crap  It's the kind of stuff  The sensational stuff  That people enjoy  Yeah I get  I get off  Knowing people  Are looking at their radios  In their cars  And going  Did I just hear that?  Yeah  Yeah make sure you get  Wow in your car  Perhaps the duo's  Most famous  And infamous bit  Is the wow promotion  Well is it 
[01:07:30]  Famous or infamous bit?  Or whip them out Wednesday  It just popped in my head  You know  If ladies would flash  While we're stuck in traffic  How much fun could that be?  That's why these men  Showed up at this sticker stop  So they might be wowed  Is wow sexist?  Ugh  I'm so sick of this question  Is wow sexist?  Is she asking you guys that?  Or is she asking a victim woman?  No us  And then she asks a 75 year old lady 
[01:08:00]  That of course is going to say  It's offensive  Who would want to see a 75 year old lady wow?  Oh I would  Yeah  I hope he likes it  Just for the sheer joy  Of seeing her humiliate herself  Two years before her death  But as far as sexual  You know  Arousal  There is none  God Norton  You're fired up today  I like this  It just annoys me  I like the fired up Norton  People are discretionary  Is wow sexist  Go to Istanbul  And see what sexism is all about  Yeah  Where they wrap their women up  And just their eyeballs are popping out 
[01:08:30]  And they have to walk behind the guy  That's a little sexist  Or even the next  If this show was in Istanbul  We'd have to change the game to  What's in my veil?  Whip out your elbow  Yeah  Imagine that  That guy's just going  Oh  My life is lovely  And they would be turned on just the same  That's the weird part about it  Oh my god  Flesh  And then of course the fun part  The flogging and stoning of the woman  That showed her elbow  That whore 
[01:09:00]  So you know  The National Organization of Women  They complain about dice  And about this type of stuff  And Clinton does what he does  And they keep their stupid  Mouth shut  So they should all drop dead  Is wow sexist  I was in Greece over the vacation  The women are still very subservient  Over there  In that country  Good  She was a whore  Yeah of course  God  At least we're cut  Is wow sexist? 
[01:09:30]  No  I don't think so  Why not?  We're not forcing anyone to do it  There's just plenty of ladies that are willing to oblige  Not the founder of this anti-Opian Anthony website  Who filed a complaint with FCC against the duo  Filed a complaint  How old is she?  She was way over there  Was she really old?  Way over there  She probably has health problems  Nice  How does it feel to have your heart slowing down 
[01:10:00]  You bag of meat?  Nice dirt nap is around the corner  That's it  Worry about Opie and Anthony  Take your medication  And hug your grandchildren  Disgraceful old crud  I love it when they get beat up by young thugs  And their purses are taken  And their medication is spilled  How great would that be  If a diabetes medication was spilled?  Oh my god 
[01:10:30]  Yeah  Oh no  Yeah she is quite the spark plug  Of course you're not right man  Oh man  That's why we love you  They are always just these old women  That have no business  Even knowing about this program  You know what I mean?  But they know exactly what people want to watch 
[01:11:00]  Or listen to  They know what the younger generation wants  Sure  The same thing they wanted  Back in the 30s  Yeah  Steve what's up?  What's up guys?  Hey man  Hey Norton  What's up man?  Hey do you have a website or something?  I gotta know when you're coming to Cleveland  Dude I actually have one  These people called Accurate Imaging  Are doing one for me  And it's gonna be up within a few days  I'm just working out a couple of bugs  And there's something I have to do  But thank you man  It will be up very shortly  Yeah he'll go out to Cleveland soon enough

Well are we  Did we go back a little  Alright here's her comment I think  And last month 
[01:12:00]  The FCC initiated an inquiry  Journalism professor Ruth Baird Smith  Is writing a book on talk radio  She says she's troubled  By what she hears  On Opie and Anthony's show  Oh shut up  Troubled  Troubled  This is a classical station  Somewhere in the city  Listen to that  Well you know what the problem is  She's one of those stupid  Feminists who decided  To keep both names  You understand  They want to keep both names  Until they get divorced  Then all of a sudden  You know she'll keep Smith  There you go  And get half her husband's money  Or hopefully he died 
[01:12:30]  Right  If he didn't  Until they get divorced  Pig  They test the limits  Of the first amendment  Very cleverly  Thank you  Cleverly  You bitch  How great would it be  If she had a mastectomy  And we could do  Whip it out Wednesday  She's got that  I used to be a man voice  Yeah  Yeah  It's the  I used to be a man voice  I think  Speaking about 
[01:13:00]  I used to being a man  Holy ass  That teacher  The school teacher  We'll get into that  A little later  Well you could get into it  All you like  I'll just look at the picture  In the paper  Wow  Alright  They test the limits  Of the first amendment  Very cleverly  Thank you  For what  But they test them  At the expense of women  Blacks  Homosexuals  And other minorities  God  Yes  That  Yeah  And they enjoy it  You bitch 
[01:13:30]  She's again  A typical white liberal  Who is so apologetic  And frightened  She's a little bunny rabbit  And she should put on ears  And hop in front of a train  And die  Little frightened liberal bunny rabbit  Drop dead  You insincere twat  You know what  You're absolutely right  Of course  It is the liberal  White  Jackasses  That believe  They honestly believe  That these people  Cannot take care of themselves  They believe black people  You can't take care of yourself  You need this white liberal piece of crap there 
[01:14:00]  To tell you  What's good  What's bad  And to save you  My god  From the likes of radio shows  And gays have to be protected  Yeah  Women  Oh my god  You women out there  National organization of women  They're there  Because you are not smart enough  To decide for yourselves  What's good for you  And you need protection  You're like the poor little waif  Being tied to the train tracks  You know what  They  Go away  You're not needed  You know what  And we could spend time  To prove our point here  Yeah  We make gay jokes 
[01:14:30]  Minority jokes  Sure  We make fun of women  We make fun of everything  I could get gay guys on the phone right now  Black guys on the phone now  Asian guys on the phone right now  And they're fine with it  Because they know who they are as people  We goof on everybody  If you ever see me on stage  The first thing I do  Is trash my awful body  It's the first thing I should do  Because I'm in horrible shape  So I make fun of it  I write her  Ruth  I hate Ruth Baird  I really hate her  I hate Ruth Baird  Yeah  It just pisses me off  Ruth Baird  Very cleverly  But they test them 
[01:15:00]  At the expense of women  Blacks  Homosexuals  And other minorities  At least once a day  On your show  You drop in something  That says  Hey faggot  Well yeah  That's what guys do  It's not  Hey faggot  Let me play one of the clips here  Friggin fag  You want to make out or something  See that's one  Where's the other fun one  Howdy  Faggot

[01:16:00]  I wear your shirts  I support the show  And I want to know  What Norton thinks  He thinks he knows  About feminism  What I don't like  About feminism  Is that it's become  This perpetual victimization  Of women  Instead of the removal  Of stereotypes  There you go  Like pinkish for girls  Have you ever been  Do you know anything  About the national organization  Why don't you come  On a gradient data  Oh yeah  Norton said  They were dumb  Well people can figure it out  They've overextended  Their purpose  We want to show  That we're responsible 
[01:16:30]  Broadcasting  Right  I totally believe that  Now they do have actually  They do have actually  A certain purpose  Like every other organization  And they completely  Overextend it  And then you can't  Take them seriously  You know what  There's extremes  In any organization  And you know that  Any organization  I agree with you  And I hate them all  I don't like  Any of the special  Hey Alex  Yes  You know something  Maybe the national  Organization of women  Had a really good point  When they were  Trying to get  The woman's right  To vote  Trying to get  Women into jobs  Yes  You know what 
[01:17:00]  What happens  When that's done  Well there's other issues  Like in San Luis  You talked about it yourself  We are working on  Dan just to keep  Your organization going  Just to keep  The organization going  You come up  With other things  And start  Nickpicking  At things  Women  Are completely capable  Of taking care  Of themselves  Making their own  Decisions  Yes  They don't need  Now  To tell them  What they should  And shouldn't do  That's not what  Now is about though  And now  Shouldn't be  Trying to regulate 
[01:17:30]  Entertainment  You're right  And now doesn't  Now that is not  Stop it  That bitch  Wants us gone  So bad  And she's  Doing everything  Possible  To try to get us gone  I totally agree  With you  On everything  You're talking about  And what kind of  Homo are you  Being in now  Well you met me  You want to  Tell me what kind  Of homo I am  Big bruiser guy  Are you  You met me  So you tell me  What kind of homo  I am  Dude why is it  Seriously  Like groups like now  When Dice was really 
[01:18:00]  Hot in like 1991  Selling out arenas  They were protesting  The sponsors  Yeah you're right  You're right  And I disagree with that  Because Dice was right on that  That's what my problem is  I totally agree  With you on that  But that's not  A major agenda  Alex have you  Banged anyone from now  There you go  No  That's a reason  To get involved  What's that  Although they're all pigs  Dude  There's some good looking ones  Oh please  Hey you go to the colleges  And stuff  Alex answer me this  Do all now women  Have to be on top

[01:23:30]  You're being a faggot  It doesn't mean anything  He's going to start  Picking up a ball  Bean hammer  And going out  And bashing gay people  No  The god damn word  That  Please  Look at this  Show you how  With babies people  Look at that guy  Alex caller from the national organization  And how mad people get  When you talk  Come down here and say that to me  Shut your face stupid  Come down and say that to me  What's wrong with people  Alright come on  Let's get through this  Sometimes spills into behavior 
[01:24:00]  Into our society  And  Can't prove that  Show me a study  Well you can actually  At this time  At this type of radio  No  There's not one study  That has been made  Of course there's not  And I'm not saying  That they encourage people  To do that  But  It makes it the norm  Hearing it on the radio  Makes it the norm  So many of these  Persons make the argument  That if you don't like  What you hear  You have the power  It's in your hand  Just turn off the radio  Right  Yeah  What did she say to that 
[01:24:30]  Well the latest thing  Is people  You know  Say well that's the easy thing  To do  Yeah  That's just a cop out  When they say  Just turn off the radio  Turn it off  No that's what you do  You turn off the radio  If you don't like it  And that's true  But you can't  Shut it off everywhere  You can't  You take the bus  You can't  What  You can't  You can't  You can't  You can't  Shut it off  I want to yell that  In her face  You can't  You can't  Shut it off  And that's true 
[01:25:00]  But you can't  Shut it off everywhere  You take the bus  To New York  It's a big wow  Advertisement  You get in the cab  The cab driver's  Listening to it  So it's part  Of the culture  Alright  You know something  You can tell the cab driver  To shut it off  By the way  And he will  And not only that  Oh you're on the bus  And all of a sudden  You see a big wow sign  Or something like that  And you can't  Shut it off  Because it's just there  How about  You're driving down the street  And you see some  Snotty nose  Filthy homeless person  On the side of the street  And that offends you  Some people are very offended 
[01:25:30]  By that  You can't shut that off  That's just in the air  There are plenty  Of offensive things  That you might see  On a billboard  That might offend you  How come with radio  Radio's easy  You just turn the dial  You shut it off  How come they're complaining  About 14 year old girls  Posing and gapping  Ads or whatever  Their companies are  Right  You know  Not that I'm complaining  I'm going to encourage it  But you see that  All over Times Square  Right  That could offend people  Their life is being ruled  By an appliance  Nice  It's like a blender 
[01:26:00]  It's a blender  It's got an off button  Could you imagine  Could you imagine  The blender whirring away  In the kitchen  And you call up people  And go  I can't take this blender noise  You can just turn it off  No  This is making a noise  That offends me  It's going  Wheeeee  It has an off button  That's a cop out  It's driving me crazy  My toaster  It won't  It keeps burning my bagels  When I get stuck in there 
[01:26:30]  And I have to take the knife  And I don't want to  My parents always said  Don't use the knife  And the toaster  In New York  Their presence does seem  To be everywhere  And Opie and Anthony  Hope for the same success  In cities from Sacramento  To Chicago  But hold on  Chicago has its own  Hot talker  Man cow  And that's where  This segment ends  I, I, I, I at all  There you go  Remember Portia  When you promised  That we wouldn't be

I loved it  I was riveted  Is that good for Philly?  That's excellent for Philly  It's all good for Philly  Riveted  The other program directors  Are getting a little pissed off  At you, Tim  You know what?  Because  News you lose  You come on our show  News you lose

John McRae  From WCMF in Rochester  Really?  Yep  Well, I'll call John up after I get done talking to you  All right  Who else can I call?

[01:30:30]  You said that I didn't  At the sushi restaurant  Uh-huh  And he was telling me a story about you, man  Now what?  I guess you got some goofy friends from the past, right?  Yeah  Some friends that you go way back with, right?  Yeah  And one of your friends wants to advertise on our radio network?  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  You know, I don't think I'm gonna do this justice  Would you like to explain to Anthony?  Because I haven't told him yet 
[01:31:00]  Well, out of respect to my family and the Stevens family  I promised I would respect their privacy  And, you know  Do I have to get into it now?  Oh  Well, he wants to advertise on the show, right?  This is in the works  Yeah  You have to do it, Tim  He's your friend  How do I do this tastefully?  Yeah, see?  It's hard, huh?  It's harder than it seems  It's funny you wouldn't use the word tastefully  Yeah  Ah, there's a little hint  Tim, do you know what I'm talking about?  Uh-huh  Uh-huh  Uh-huh 
[01:31:30]  Tim Sabian  The fine program director down there in Philly  Has this friend, Anthony  Yeah  Who's gonna spend lots of money on our radio network  That's a good thing  That's very good  That is correct  Those are good friends to have  Tim, he has a pill, right?  Yeah  From what I've heard about this pill so far  I think it will sweep the nation  It'll  I really do  I think this is something that everybody can get into  Uh-huh  Get into  Uh-huh 
[01:32:00]  And, uh, Tim, what does this pill do?  Uh, it enhances, uh, it, uh  I love you squirm  Squirm, you bastard  Squirm  It makes everything  It  It just, it, it, it just tastes better  That's all  Oh, it, it, it, it's a pill that makes it taste better  Makes what taste better?  Things like if you're having, what?  I don't know 
[01:32:30]  A meal you don't like?  You pop the pill  There you go  Yeah  And it tastes better  And it tastes better?  Yeah  Something like that?  Yeah  Are we getting warmer?  Yeah  It's all about food?  Or are we talking about something else?  Yeah  It tastes better  Yeah  Listen up  I can't vouch for it  I haven't tried the product  But  Tim, just  Tim, just spit it out  It makes it so much easier  You're just, you're just prolonging this  Uh, it, it, it, uh  Huh, this pill that your friend has, right? 
[01:33:00]  There'll be a very good advertiser  I don't know how the hell we're going to advertise it  It's going to take some very creative copywriting  Anthony, Tim still hasn't, uh, explained what this pill does  I know  It's just another incentive to not turn off the O&A shelf  Mr. Sabian?  Yes, sir  What does this pill do?  Say you're doing a commercial for it right now  Go ahead  It's on the shelves now  Oh, it is on the shelves now  No, no, it will be  Okay  What does this pill do? 
[01:33:30]  It, uh, it, uh, takes, uh, bodily fluids  And, uh, and, uh, uh, flavors them  Oh, right  I think, um  Oh  I think he's getting closer  So this pill  So if you, um, took the pill  And you blow your nose  Uh, what is in the tissue will, uh, taste like what?  Um, no, that, uh  Earwax, things like that  Bodily fluids 
[01:34:00]  Tears  Tears  Sure  Are we getting warmer?  Yeah  Mr. Sabian, if I was, like, say I was to hire a young lady to tinkle into a bucket so I could listen  Would that be a different flavor?  No  No, no, okay  All right  We're getting there, though  We're getting there  But you're close  Let's think  What could possibly  What could the advantage be of certain fluid being flavored?  Well, what fluid would  Let's, let's, let's ask, let's ask Tim the flavors 
[01:34:30]  All right  Citrus  Citrus  Citrus  Yes  And?  And, uh, I, I believe they can also create flavor of the month  Flavor of the month  Would it be, uh, safe to assume that, uh, tuna will not be a flavor?  Hey!  That's funny  Will cherry be a flavor?  Or like Hubba Bubba, would that be an original flavor?  There you go  There you go  Wait, cherry's one of the flavors?  Yeah  Cherry  Yeah  Cherry  For whose fluids, sir, if I may? 
[01:35:00]  Both  This would make horny goat weed look like Tic Tacs  Ah  It makes your, uh, your scene taste like cherries?  Tim?  What's that?  The short naps are great, what?  It makes, uh, either, um, uh, whatever is, um, being, um, excreted  Tastes like cherry or citrus?  Yes, correct  Or citrus  Any other flavors?  Uh, I think just about any flavor you could possibly 
[01:35:30]  Nacho cheese?  Yeah  What if you're, what if you're going out with a Puerto Rican girl?  Could it taste like mango?  If you choose to, sure  Would it be wrong if you whacked your bag on someone's Sunday?  I get friendly  There you go  Hey, here's your Jim Dan  I'm Jim  Oh, man 
[01:36:00]  Well, that sounds like, uh  Oh  When do you take this pill?  I don't know  I haven't taken it yet  Don't  You don't know how long you gotta, uh, take  You take the pill and wait  I think you take it and then over the course of a week or so  I'm not, I don't have the particular  Oh, oh, so it's something that's built up  Yeah  Yeah  That's good  Something, um, would it be flavors that, uh, maybe the kids would enjoy?  Sure  All the way 
[01:36:30]  Right?  The whole family  Just wondering, okay  Rich wants to know if it, uh, can you make it taste like banana juice?  Absolutely  In the honor of, uh, of Dice Clay?  Yeah  Banana juice!  All right  Well, I cannot wait  Till we are, um, advertising this product on our show  And how are they gonna sell it?  Uh, I don't know  I think it's, uh, either via, you know, an order through the phone or  I mean, but how are they gonna sell it?  I don't know how the copy is gonna be written  That we can read it on the air to clearly  We'll work all that out 
[01:37:00]  Let people know what it is  See, it's easy to talk about Sam Adams  Right, we'll work all this out  Okay  Are they gonna be in, like, Pathmark having taste tests?  I imagine that one  Close your eyes and drink from two mules  Can I go now?  All right, Tim  I need to stick my finger down my throat  Okay, thank you  Thank you  Will that be one of the flavors?  All right, Tim  Goodbye  There you go  That's something 
[01:37:30]  All right, let's take another break so we can catch up  All right  All righty  Um, is that wild or what?  That is something  I don't know  I'm wondering what  What medical implications are there?  Like, what does it do  That it would actually flavor that stuff?  Or say you have cherry flavor  And a diabetic's giving you a Hummer  Well, all these  Very interesting questions  That must be answered  Yes, Rick?  Rick?  They have their copy  You don't have their copy 
[01:38:00]  What is that?  Oh, okay  Yes  Oh, yeah  Are we reverting back to yesterday's program?  Reverting back to  Oh, we don't have the 80s music today  Yes, we do  I remember this copy from  This was a Dr. Gregory Pistone copy from yesterday  The fine doctor 
[01:38:30]  Go to his website  DrPistone.com  They sure knew how to rock in the 80s, Anthony  80s bands were the best, Opie  It was all about the taste  Some of us have lost some of that taste  Huh, Anthony?

[01:50:00]  This is  You know something?  When Sonny got shot in the toll booth, right?  And they brought him back home  Sonny Corleone  Sonny got shot in the toll booth  He brought him back home  And they brought him back home  When the funeral guy  The funeral parlor owner  Came to the house of Don Corleone  He didn't say  I'll try to make Sonny presentable  Don Corleone  I figured he would say something like that  Anthony  He did it because he knew  It was time to do a favor for his Don  And he was there 
[01:50:30]  Now, Lady Di  It is time to do a favor  Why'd she hang up?  What is wrong with her?  It sounded like her phone was a little on the fritz  Maybe she got shot at the toll booth  We can only dream  That that wacky coincidence just happened  She got shot at the toll booth  Well, not funny  I was just saying the toll booth thing  And someone wasted her  It's great  We're going to be at the VMA's tomorrow  And we want them to do some of the interviews  Look, yeah  We're going to be at the Video Music Awards  On the red carpet  As they bring the people in  And, you know  We could stand out there

[02:24:30]  I didn't mean that  to come out  like I was that  hey why aren't you  sending us anyone  from Big Brother anymore?  what do you mean?  Big Brother 2  what do you mean  you bring around?  oh you want me  to bring Bunky?  are you high?  we can talk to the Bunkster  now they're doing  a crossover thing  with Survivor  and Big Brother  it's like the  Flintstones Jetsons  episode  remember that  when both shows  are just dying  well yeah  here's the segue  before the amazing race  tonight  Big Brother 2  special time  right 8 o'clock  special night  I'm watching 
[02:25:00]  with the Survivor  people coming on  very cool  you have to get us  Nicole  because I think  she's the biggest  bitch and I want  to tell her to her face  then I'll definitely  bring her on  no problem  she's never going  to get it  alright  yeah  never going to get it  let me write that down  and I'm digging Will  because he's so honest  and real  yeah  see I watch  the Big Brother 2  but they're throwing  the Survivor  people in tonight  yeah  what's that about  that  it's all good  Flintstones Jets  Jetsons 
[02:25:30]  just like I said  remember that  yeah  and it was the Flintstones  with the fake Fred voice  hey it's George Jetson  Barney  it's like that's not even  Fred's voice  what the hell is that  I hope it works out  it's like the Brady Bunch  when they brought  those other three kids by  oh the Kelly kids  yeah  the Kelly kids  with the guy from F Troop  as the father  right  he's a pilot  for another show  well look at you  you know your stuff  the F Troop guy  adopted these three kids  and they were friends  with the Brady  it was a white kid  a black kid  and an Asian kid 
[02:26:00]  it was  the Cruises  what was their name  they were the Kellys  no I meant  I went  Tom Cruise  right  the Cruises  exactly  hey that's pretty good  nice  oh yeah  look who we're here with  Bill Corkin  is the most  to talk about  so yeah  Big Brother 2  with the Survivor people  is at 8 o'clock tonight  they're going to do  a little competition  or something crazy  like that  you guys picked  the worst Survivor people  who'd they get  Jervis  Sue Hawk  Sue Hawk is cool 
[02:26:30]  Jervis is  Jervis was in the studio  what  Jervis was in the studio  yeah  he's  we weren't feeling  the Jervis  Alicia  she's got nothing  going on  and then  what's his name  Jeff's cool  yeah Jeff's cool  we're really honest  on this show  I know  I listen to you guys  actually  do you really  yeah  my wife is actually  listening right now  she listens to you guys  oh cool  no money driving home  I listen to you guys  I like it  you guys are  you guys are  breakout  it's a good thing 
[02:27:00]  we just hang  so what time tonight  does it's a mad mad  mad mad world  it's the amazing race  at 9 o'clock tonight  on CISNO FAST  trivia  it's a mad mad world  rat race  didn't they make a movie  I did some  you know I didn't see that  but a lot of people said  that that movie was pretty cool  yeah okay  now this is a good idea  I like this  but the thing  the problem with me  is I like a lot  of the ideas  of these reality shows  I hear the ideas  and then I go  wait  can I interrupt you 
[02:27:30]  I know you were  flowing and stuff  but look at  line three  Pete  line three  Pete  oh and hey  yeah what's up  what's up boys  I want to ask Debbie something  yeah go ahead  yeah I want to know  if they're going to get  Fonty to jump  to Big Brother house  hey  they're going down  hey  they jump to Big Brother house  all right  sorry about that  Anthony you were saying  about the amazing race  yeah I like the ideas  of a lot of the shows  and this one  again I'm like  this sounds cool 
[02:28:00]  yeah  start out with a bunch of teams  where do they start  Central Park  yeah they start in New York  and then they have to end up  in Central Park  well they circumnavigate the world  right  yeah  well I mean you can't  take a shortcut  and go  yeah exactly  you've got to go around  the world  but you know  I mean the thing about these shows  is there are a lot of good ideas  out there  but if you get people that suck  I mean nobody cares  exactly  and you know  I think they made  the right choices with this  and the person who  actually chose all the people  for the first Survivor  was the person who chose 
[02:28:30]  the people for this  particular show  and you know  you've got to get that right  because if you don't get people  that are inherently interesting  uh-huh  and who gives it  you know  right right right  you know what I'm saying  and that's really what's  going to make this show work  you've got people like  Jerry Bruckheimer  behind the show  you've got you know  CBS obviously don't want to  follow up with Survivor  with something that's not  going to really work  and so they've got to get  people that are interesting  and you've got  I mean there's a separated  couple on the show  yeah  now some of the couples  yeah one couple is  they work as a team  they're a separated couple  yeah 
[02:29:00]  they're going through a divorce  well no they're going  through a separation  meaning they're like  they decided that  the best way to see  whether they should be together  is to test out  their relationship on the show  oh my god  that's what you want  25,000 miles of  backseat driving  and nagging  that's always good  for a relationship  yeah really  all I can say  is it makes for good television  yeah well  I would dump her  somewhere in the ocean  I think would be a good place  Anthony I have to  interrupt you again  because there's another  question coming in  for Debbie over there  the publicist from CBS 
[02:29:30]  Joe  hey guys  there's a special name  for these reality  TV show crossovers  like the Big Brother 2  Survivor thing  that's happening tonight  exactly like that  8 o'clock on CBS  sure go ahead  there's a technical name  and this name is  a last ditch effort  I think guys  one more thing  yeah  long live naked sexy  fun time  all right  later  comment Debbie  no  okay  all right  awful  what's some of the other teams  you got a gay team 
[02:30:00]  yeah  there's a Joan Bill  Team Guido  Team Guido  they got like a little dog  and then  you know  that's like their mascot  except they didn't bring  that little dog with us  she's really busting apart  those stereotypes  the little dog named Guido  yeah  yeah  and they're a team  yeah they're a team  and then  somehow  like it didn't matter  where we went in the world  these guys seem to be  like immaculately dressed  everybody was  everybody's all shabby  you know  unshaven  and these guys  it's like they walked out  of some you know  spa treatment  fantastic  how's that for a topper 
[02:30:30]  why does every reality show  have to have a gay guy now  it's the law  well you know  it's the law  okay  what I like about the  you know the people  that they chose  I mean there's even  grandparents on this show  oh yeah  yeah there's a mother-daughter  I mean they're like  a typical mother-daughter  relationship you find  anywhere in America  and I like the fact that  it's real people  it's not people necessarily  with a great six pack  and you know  big biceps  there are some  pretty out of shape people  on this show  you're like grandparents  yeah  25,000 miles  of the left blinker on  wait  where are we going mommy 
[02:31:00]  and now  how does this work  they start out  in Central Park  are there checkpoints  that they have to  hit around the globe  yeah  I mean essentially  and do they all get  different checkpoints  no  no no  they're all running  they're going on  the same course  they get the same information  they get envelopes  and they all leave  at the same time  they leave at the same time  and  you start punching the crap  out of the old couple  you take them out of it  yeah  that's nice  so they start in Central Park 
[02:31:30]  where are they going first  I'd rather you just watch the show  because you know  you want to give it away  but the reality is  they get the envelope  with the information  they all get given  the same information  they get the same resources  like in terms of money  you know  going to the different countries  and so on  and it really comes down to  the choices that they make  the alliances that they make  you know  whether they choose to team up  with their grandparents  or whether they go with  we had some frat brothers  on this team  these guys have known each other  for about 15 years  these guys are hysterical  and very out of shape  but funny  they're bold  and they've never traveled 
[02:32:00]  you know  they really haven't traveled  that much  and you see them go  to these exotic places  and they're like  you know  they forget they're in a race  you know  dude look at this place  you know  and the whole idea  is to get back  where the money is  they get kicked on  no they all have to take  the same thing  like they leave Central Park  if let's say  they have to go  now to England  yeah  would they all have to take  a cab to the airport  or can they take a train  do they have to take  the same exact things  or  no  and that's where  it comes down to choices  get the lead on someone else 
[02:32:30]  and they got the same  it comes down to choices  there's going to be  some choices  to be made  there's lots of choices  at bonfire  oh wait  no bonfires  no bonfire  do you have a host  that steps in  and  comes out of the fire  yeah  ladies and gentlemen  now what you're observing  we'll have to talk  to the couples  yes  no I'm good  I try to sit back  it's about them  it's not about the host  it's not about the format  do you actually care  to watch these people  are they interesting  or not 
[02:33:00]  if they're not interesting  then  are you the host  yeah you didn't know that  Debbie didn't tell you anything  Debbie what's going on here  you're like the Jeff Probst guy  he's like the Jeff Probst guy  and you made him wait for an hour  did you really  Debbie you didn't tell  what's going on  I thought you were like  the camera guy or something  who are we going to blame for this  all right what do you do  wait this is really cool now  what do you do  oh Anthony's woken up  yeah like what do you do  all of a sudden  you intro the whole thing  we were just going through  the meet the people  we were just going through  the motions 
[02:33:30]  we thought  camera guy  we'll get rid of him  yeah yeah  no I'm just kidding  hey man this is your show  this is your airtime  we're just here  trying to talk about our show  whatever  wow he's like the Jeff Probst guy  so you do the intros  you meet the couples  a little bit  I mean the idea is really  the less I have to do  the more  you know  the better they are  I mean it's like  it's like with all of these gigs  it's the same with Jeff's gig  on Survivor  it's not about him  it's not about the format  of the show  it's about  oh Jeff doesn't think  it's not about him  Jeff thinks it's all about him  hanging out of that  god damn helicopter 
[02:34:00]  like he's a gunner  in Nam  he likes getting involved  that guy  looks like he was in Rambo 2  bringing in that helicopter  do you hang out of any helicopters  no  that's a great shot  for these shows  you know  this is a great gig  because  I mean I get to go  to all these great places  and the reality is  I'm just there to explain things  if they get complicated  and just to help the audience  understand what's going on  and of course  I have to eliminate the teams  the teams they get  in the last of the pit stops  without ruining anything 
[02:34:30]  any danger element  well  yeah  it's dangerous  to send some of these  these Americans  these ugly Americans  into these foreign countries  and no one gets hurt though  like they did on Survivor  with the burning or anything  well  it's like  it's less about like  danger than it is about  these people being a danger  to each other  if you know what I'm saying  does some stupid son of a bitch  make a joke about  Mohammed's beard  in a mosque  there are definitely  no  that was Opie  on his vacation  there are definitely  some ugly incidents 
[02:35:00]  with my quote  what's the big deal  yeah  that's Opie  he's in  where were you  Turkey  at  Cappadocia  not the blue mosque  I was in Istanbul  in like a palace  they turned into a museum  near the blue mosque  I think  yeah just  where you walk down  that long thing  actually that's another mosque  the blue mosque  you know where the blue mosque is  yeah the blue mosque  and then there was  a really old mosque  but then there's another  but it's like a half a mile away  where you walk down  that long  sure why not  you know what I like  I love Turkey  Mexico  right next to China 
[02:35:30]  at Epcot  yes  and I could walk right there  I don't know about the tunnels  in Turkey  and Istanbul  I just know  I could get Japanese  and I could walk  across the African states  we were having a little  I know you guys  Turkey remember that place  yes it was a great place  yeah Indiana Jones  and Belloc talking  great  explain to him what I did  explain to him what I did though  in this  oh he goes into this place  and you know they have  Mohammed's beard hair  did you see that  I didn't see that  it's encased in glass  yeah  and these people are like  oh my god  it's like a catholic  walking in and seeing  Christ's sandal or something  you know what I mean 
[02:36:00]  it's like old decaying  and rotting and everything  yeah a little beard hair  a couple of  bristles  yeah it's like this tall  two or three bristles  and they're all freaking out  and they're all freaking out  Opie walks in and goes  huh  in this echoey thing  what's what's the big big deal  deal deal  really  you don't say that  I missed it  I don't know  thank god he looks like  some kind of Muslim  and maybe they thought  he doesn't look like  an American  what a tool  so I guess that could  cause some problems  people not familiar 
[02:36:30]  with some of the customs  around the world  I tell you there's some  there's some really  interesting things that  happen because  you know there's a lot  of really street smart  people that are in this show  meaning street smart in America  but you get them out  to some foreign land  with some weird culture  and they're like  you know  and they're looking around  at some places  and they just don't get it  you know  they just don't realize  that they're in some  foreign land  and that you gotta  like change your ways  a little bit  otherwise you're gonna  get your ass  do the couples have protection  as they're doing this  though  condoms  yeah  something like that  yeah they got all that  chaperones or something  there's all that protection 
[02:37:00]  no you know  they're not  they're not put in  any dangerous situation  right  you didn't send them  they're more dangerous  to other people  quite frankly  do the old people  need adult diapers  that's a good question  oh jeez  where are we  and then how  I refer to Debbie now  what's the grand prize now  one million bucks  it's a million bucks  for the first team  to get back to Central Park  the first team  to circumnavigate the world  circumnavigate the world  yeah I can't tell you  exactly where we're going  all right I can't tell  so we have a finish line  hold on  are couples getting  eliminated every week  yeah the way it works 
[02:37:30]  is the 11 teams race  there are eight  elimination points  along the way  and the last team  to arrive at those  elimination points  they're out  oh so that's like  the check points  the last people to get there  yeah  and that's what I like  about it because  is it sort of like  the eco challenge  in a way  it's different because  the eco challenge  is more about the physical stuff  I mean you can  they were all athletes  yeah exactly  and so it's much more physical  this is more about  what's going on with the  you know in the relationships  because you're going to see  some pretty interesting  stuff happen  I mean the relationships  you know they get pulled apart  they get back together again  they're screaming yelling 
[02:38:00]  they're you know  obviously very happy  sometimes sometimes  it's just like you think  this is it they're gone  they're out of this thing  and what's kind of cool  is to watch how the teams change  because they all  they all change  some of the weaker teams  at the beginning are like  there's no way  they're going the distance  oh really  yeah there's no way  they're going you know  to the next couple of countries  and then somehow  some of them like  you know somehow  get together  and they keep going  you know  what's happening  you got another message there  yeah one of our listeners  just hung up  he wanted to say  if there's a checkpoint in Greece  the gay couple's  never going to leave  oh my god 
[02:38:30]  you look at you  with your dopey stereotypes  I didn't say  the guy that just hung up  how cool was it  to do working with  Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise  so what is it  the first couple  that gets the truckload  of cores  back across state line  and doesn't get caught  by Smokey  I don't care  if you're a  Broderick Crawford  that's an attention getter  excuse me nice lady  I'll have a Diablo sandwich 
[02:39:00]  and a Dr. Pippin  make it snappy  I'm in a goddamn hurry  woohoo sheriff  not bad  hey Lewis what's up  Lewis  hey dude  hey man  yeah we're talking to  Phil Kogan  the host of The Amazing Race  yes  yeah I think their  idea for a show  is real great  it's real interesting  I've been trying to  break into the business lately  I'm curious about  some of my ideas  alright  I've been thinking about  a show where you know  you watch old people sleep  shut up  and I've been thinking 
[02:39:30]  about another show  wait what's the name  of that one dude  it's called  old people sleeping  I got a better idea  for a show  listen to one of  Lewis's phone calls  Jesus Christ  that guy's ponderous  Phil we apologize for that  listen man I like your show  go ahead do your show  Andrew  hey how you doing  hey  I used to watch this show  on Saturday mornings  it was called  Wacky Races  Dick Dastardly  Dick Dastardly  and the dog  yeah  Chumley  Mutley right  yeah

[02:41:00]  right now  oh yeah  oh well cause I'm  it's like  I said to a friend of mine  it's like  it's like  I'm selling a whole lot  of luxury cars to people  and I sent them out  and then I hope  the wheels don't fall off  because uh  you know  I'm going  yeah this show is great  we got couples  we got this  we got that  and you're  you're selling  selling  selling  selling  all day  and you're up all night  staring at the ceiling  oh Jesus Christ  a hundred damn interviews  you know what I mean  and you're selling  selling  selling  and then you go  to sleep at night  do you really think  that show is gonna be  that great  you know  I mean  I want it to work  but you don't know  we can relate  we can do that  with this stupid radio show

[02:43:00]  Opie's about 60 feet down  the French guy  lands right on top of him  but you know  it's underwater  so Opie just kind of  pushes him away  and the guy like  turns around  and hits him again  Opie clocks him  he punches the French guy  60 feet underwater  in some bizarre  sea hunt episode  this is no wacky radio bit  this is a true story  and then he punched me back  and then we kind of like  they're fighting underwater  and you really got in a real fight  with somebody underwater  the French guy  60 feet underwater  see  I don't mind hearing that story  because the French  blew up the Rainbow Warrior  in New Zealand  so you know  he had it coming to us
