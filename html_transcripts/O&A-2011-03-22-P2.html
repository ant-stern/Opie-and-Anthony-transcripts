<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show Live broadcast, celebrating the fifth anniversary of the infamous Mobile, Alabama "Leprechaun" news story, featured Sam Roberts, E-Rock, Danny, Travis, and Troy, with D-Boy absent.  The show opened with clips of the original, bewildered news reports about the alleged leprechaun sighting.  A significant portion then focused on personal anecdotes from the show’s staff.  Engineer Mars revealed his unusual habit of standing to urinate after a bowel movement, claiming sitting was "gay," a practice deemed unusual by a staff poll. This led to Mars's subsequent hiding in embarrassment.

The broadcast played a five-year-old audio recording of a furious argument between Lily Tomlin and David O. Russell from the set of "I Heart Huckabees," filled with profanity and insults directed at both each other and Dustin Hoffman. Anthony detailed the "complete fucking nuisance" of receiving numerous long voicemails from a woman he briefly dated.  The show also addressed letters from "Crazy Lynn," who claimed conflicting familial relationships with both Opie and Anthony.  

Further discussion involved Anthony's fiancée Jess's business trip to Brazil, sparking speculation about a suggestive Brazilian dance, and Sam Roberts' alleged "male flirting." Ron Bennington from the Ron and Fez show made a brief guest appearance.  The show concluded with a chaotic segment featuring on-air reprimands for several staff members, including Mars and Mark Zito.  Throughout the broadcast, profanity and off-color humor were prevalent.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, and I am Sam Roberts.  I barely made it this time.  I had to get my way through a sea of management and Roland, unfortunately,  to try to get a comment from Anthony after what we learned today  about his ex, well, not even his ex,  this woman that keeps leaving him voicemails. 
[00:00:30]  And we'll get to that in a little bit because I haven't had time to edit it.  But, yes, this is After the Opie and Anthony Show Live,  and it's what we do when Opie and Anthony leave and the rest of us are still here.  Danny and Travis are still here.  Troy, E-Rock.  D-Boy's out today, but he'll be back tomorrow.  It's a big day today, not only because of what we learned about Ant.  It was a fantastic show, one of the best,  but it's also an anniversary today,  and we love celebrating anniversaries on After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[00:01:00]  Five years ago today, that's 2006,  the Opie and Anthony Show played for the first time  a clip that has become synonymous with this show almost.  I mean, even past this show,  it's one of the biggest clips in Internet history, I think.  And that clip, of course, is the Leprechaun story out of Mobile, Alabama.  It's five years ago today,  the first time it was played on the Opie and Anthony Show, 
[00:01:30]  and here it is, the Leprechaun story from the news,  straight from the news,  played five years ago today,  now on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community,  many of you bringing binoculars,  cancorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a little bit of a tree.  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah! 
[00:02:00]  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction,  it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say  the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe  and have come up with their own theories  and explanations for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow  from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead  that got home to the wrong stuff  and it told him to get up in a tree  and play a leprechaun. 
[00:02:30]  We're gonna get down to the bottom of this.  Yeah, stay along there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy helping to direct traffic  says he's prepared for his encounter  with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This war is all spells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute  which has been passed down  from thousands of years ago  from my great-great-grandfather  who was Irish.  I just came to help out.  Others just came to get lucky  in hopes a pot of gold  may be buried under this tree. 
[00:03:00]  I'm gonna run a backhoe  and uproot that tree.  I want to know where to go.  I want to go.  Give me the gold.  I want to go.  After O&E Live.  The crowd started gathering  around sunset.  It's a face.  It's a face.  A face.  The eye.  The nose.  The mouth.  The frowning mouth.  What come here?  It's just a face  and right now  he's not happy.  I'm not kidding.  It's a frowning face. 
[00:03:30]  It's a leprechaun.  It looks like  that looked just  like a little leprechaun.  It's still up there.  The people who see  the leprechaun  say you can see it  better at night.  And that's when the crowds  really start coming out.  Now step back  so I'm going to see it.  If you just look right there  in the middle  you see it.  Right there.  You see it?  You see it?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  Y'all see it?  I'm like he's smiling right now.  I want to see it.  If it's here,  I want to see it.  When is it before to pop up? 
[00:04:00]  Last Sunday night  and we were standing out  standing around  and he said  y'all not going to believe this  but it's like a man  is up in that tree.  And we all like  and he prayed.  Pretty soon  there were more people  creating traffic jams  all to see  what has become known  as the leprechaun.  And he was smiling.  You were smiling, huh?  Uh-huh.  And then one moment  I thought he tipped his head.  What do you think  about all the crowds  that have come?  What has it been like  the last couple of nights  as far as crowds?  Looked like Mardi Gras. 
[00:04:30]  All we need is some float.  Now some people say  they've seen the leprechaun  and some people say  they haven't.  But one thing's for sure,  nobody's found  a pot of gold yet.  After O&A,  live.  That's what it is  after Opie and Anthony live.  I am Sam Roberts.  A lot of stuff  came out on the show today.  First of all,  the leprechaun clips,  of course.  If you didn't hear,  that's five years ago today.  The first time  those clips were played  on the Opie and Anthony show  and they've been played  many times since then.  Absolutely classic clips  and hilarious. 
[00:05:00]  Today,  a lot of stuff happened  on the show.  A lot of personal revelations,  I would say.  And for the first time,  E-Rock,  there were a lot of  personal stories on the show  and they didn't involve you.  That's alright.  I mean,  it was good for you.  I mean,  I have a lot of people  getting shit on  and for a change,  you got left out of the mix.  Did you feel a little left out  or did it feel nice  for a change?  Nah,  once in a while  everybody else has got to  take their turn,  but I'm sure  the rest of the week  will be all about me  in some fashion.  Well,  you're an entertaining guy,  what can we say? 
[00:05:30]  Of course,  one of the big things  that we learned today  was Mars  likes to pee standing up  and of course,  I don't mean  just to pee.  I mean,  when he goes to  make it number two,  he then stands up  if he has to pee  because he thinks  only women sit to pee.  If you missed it  or if you didn't,  this is how we first  found out about it.  This is Mars,  our engineer.  Mars,  I was talking to Danny  and he told me  that when you go  to the bathroom,  you make a number two 
[00:06:00]  and then you leave  the stall,  wash your hands  and go to the urinal  to make a number one.  See,  the deal is with Danny,  I knew he was going  to talk about something,  so why not have him  talk about me  getting up from the toilet  to go to the urinal  as opposed to  me taking a piss  like a little bitch  sitting on the toilet  like he would.  But when you make  a number two,  you make a number one  at the same time.  Why don't you just piss  while you're on the toilet?  That's gay. 
[00:06:30]  It's not gay  to make a number one  when you make a number two.  But it seems like  you're like a little girl.  But you're already there  making a number two,  why not make a number one  while you're there?  It's all confusing to me.  It's really,  this is hard right now.  No,  what's confusing to you  is your association  with gender.  You're over,  you're overdoing  the masculine roles  to cover up  an inner femininity.  So tell me something,  when you do number two,  do you also do number one  if you have to  sit in on the toilet?  Of course.  Okay.  That's what people do. 
[00:07:00]  Okay.  You don't think so?  I don't know about that.  You gotta take a survey.  I'll do it.  And of course,  when a challenge is issued  here on After Opie and Anthony Live,  we answer that challenge.  Mars insisting,  our engineer,  the way,  when you,  E-Rock.  Yeah.  When you go to the bathroom  and you sit on the toilet,  and I know,  E-Rock,  that you don't like  to go into vulgarities,  but when you sit down  on a toilet to, 
[00:07:30]  uh,  uh,  Take a shit, Sam.  Oh,  well,  I didn't want to say that,  but okay,  in your words,  do that.  Yeah.  Do you urinate as well?  I don't see how you don't.  Because it,  like you were saying,  you do both at the same time.  Right.  It's sort of like one of those  functions you can't control.  Like,  it all comes out in one,  everything just evacuates.  So,  does he just go down there  and just sit there  and like grab it  and hold it so he won't?  He probably likes to.  It's probably one of the things  he likes to do.  Yeah,  that's not gay.  Here's,  uh,  I went and took a survey  of the ONA staffers 
[00:08:00]  to see,  maybe,  Eric,  maybe we're the weird ones.  Probably.  Let's find out.  Hey,  Travis,  when you're sitting  on the toilet  to make a number two,  do you make a number one  at the same time?  Of course,  you're already there.  Why not?  Hey,  Roland,  when you make a number two  and you're sitting on the toilet,  do you make a number one  at the same time?  Of course.  Troy,  when you're sitting  on the toilet  to make a number two,  do you make a number one  at the same time?  Of course.  Is that sort of the way it goes?  D-Boy,  when you sit down  to make a number two  on the toilet,  do you make a number one  at the same time?  Absolutely. 
[00:08:30]  Apparently, Mars is wrong.  I'm relieved to know that I'm not doing it wrong, but he also went around to engineering and asked them.  I'm just curious how he prevents it.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  How do you stop that function?  He's hiding right now because he was humiliated.  He ran into the engineering room where us staffers don't have access, so we can't get to him at the moment.  But we'll try to get to him.  Do you want me to call his phone?  No, don't call his phone.  Don't bother.  I mean, he just sits there.  He's very verbose. 
[00:09:00]  He's not saying much.  He just yaps and yaps.  Don't bother with Mars.  But, Eric, today is also an anniversary.  We played the Leprechaun story.  Today, that was 2006.  One year later, in 2007, another story broke that Opie and Anthony had a field day with.  Now, you're going to want to stay tuned through this because we still have some excerpts from Kenny recording the song Friday, the Rebecca Black song. 
[00:09:30]  We had Kenny record it today.  I left the recorder in the studio while we were in there.  Was he aware of that?  I don't know if he was or not.  Either way, he'll complain about it.  But, regardless, we will play that in a little bit.  But first, it was four years ago today that we discovered the Lily Tomlin-David O. Russell fight from the set of I Heart Huckabees.  Now, if you don't remember this, it's one of the greatest things.  It was the predecessor to the Christian Bale tape, which, at this point, everybody's aware of.  If you do remember it, you know how grand it was. 
[00:10:00]  There's also a point where she's yelling at Dustin Hoffman as well.  Of course she is.  It's an emotional time on the set of I Heart Huckabees.  Did you see that?  No, I did not.  I did.  It didn't strike me as terribly emotional.  But, regardless, I wasn't on the set.  These people were.  It's Lily Tomlin versus David O. Russell four years ago today on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Let's get into the Lily Tomlin thing.  This is just terrific.  What did that snatch liquor do now? 
[00:10:30]  Is she?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know that.  Oh, yeah.  Very good.  Dyke.  Yeah.  You never know that.  The haircut is very feminine.  Is it?  No.  The Lily Tomlin.  It's from I Heart Huckabees.  It was an argument that she was having with the director.  What's his name?  David O. Russell.  Yeah, David O. Russell.  And this guy apparently directed like Three Kings.  Three Kings. 
[00:11:00]  Then there was Three Kings.  I Heart Huckabees.  Yeah.  That could be the worst movie title in the fucking history.  The title alone makes me never want to even fucking pass it on the channels when I'm changing it.  What's a Huckabee?  I don't know.  Why would you heart it?  A town.  And it wasn't like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, the I love New York.  It's like the I heart New York.  You don't say I heart New York.  You say I love New York.  Yeah.  But everyone says I heart Huckabees instead of I love Huckabees. 
[00:11:30]  And that's annoyed me.  And that's a reason I won't ever see it.  No.  Stupid fucking title for an unwatchable movie.  Dumb.  Jesus.  It's also Rosie O'Donnell's birthday.  Whose birthday?  Rosie O'Donnell.  Oh.  Spread them out a little bit here.  Yeah.  There's a couple other people, too.  Yeah.  Cool.  We'll do the birthday thing.  We're not doing birthday things today.  Why?  We do a whole feature.  It's a new feature I suggested.  Shout out to birthdays.  It kills 45 minutes.  We shout funny things to people on their birthday.  We're going to do the birthday thing.  So Lily Tomlin and David O. Russell have their respective blowouts on the set of I heart Huckabees. 
[00:12:00]  Huckabees.  Yeah.  We start with Lily Tomlin at a desk giving it.  What?  That's my bed.  What is that supposed to say?  I forgot some words.  Oh, all right.  Whatever.  It'll be obvious.  She's sitting at a desk.  Yes.  Apparently, he was giving her some direction, which was contradictory to what she had been  told before.  Or she goes through a whole big, long scene, and then he tells her, hey, I want that a 
[00:12:30]  little different.  But now, I don't know who's right or who's wrong here.  He's the fucking director.  You got to listen to the director.  But she's also Lily Tomlin.  But she's Lily Tomlin.  So, you know, but if she's being a cunt, then what do you do?  You're a director.  You tell, you got to keep your fucking, your crew straightened out.  You can't let, you can't let these prima donnas get, get the best of you or you look  like a bad guy and you won't get any fucking respect on the set.  Hey, Brando wouldn't let Frank Oz direct him in, uh, what was the movie they did with 
[00:13:00]  De Niro?  I understand Lily Tomlin's been around for a while.  Some heist movie, right?  Yeah.  But don't compare it with fucking De Niro.  All right.  Well, here we go.  Here's Lily Tomlin going off.  And take your legs off the desk and a whole bunch of other stuff.  And it says you got to keep your, you can take your legs down too.  We could buy some.  Okay.  For Christ's sake.  Let's just take it one fucking line at a time.  Instead of changing everything as we, it's very difficult to even create what you're going 
[00:13:30]  to do when it's constant, a barrage of change this, change this, do this, do this.  No, wait, wait.  Do it a different way.  Do it a different way.  Don't get me started.  Okay.  So I'm just saying, let's just, you know, it's impossible.  One actor's doing one thing, another actor's doing another.  And I'm not, I'm not as, I'm not as brilliant as you.  I can't keep up with you.  No, we're being very efficient.  We're being very efficient?  Being patient with you.  Let's rehearse, please. 
[00:14:00]  You're being impatient.  No, I said patient.  Let's rehearse.  I couldn't understand you.  No.  It's not the first time.  Wow.  And they're making a comedy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  See, to me, even though it's Lily Tomlin, that's kind of being fucked up right there.  Like, regardless of how this guy's directing or whatever, she should just fucking do her job.  Maybe she was and maybe his direction is annoying.  You don't know what led up to that. 
[00:14:30]  Like, for instance, when I'm on a set, if someone says to me to do something else, I'll  immediately put my foot down and go, I'm the actor!  I was actually looking at Jimmy Sirius like, what do you do?  I'm the actor.  I don't know.  I think of the director as the captain of the ship.  Exactly.  And if the fucking, he steers it into the rocks, that's his fucking problem.  Maybe he's rambling about fucking keys for strawberries and Lily didn't want to listen 
[00:15:00]  anymore.  Strawberries.  Lily Tomlin is fucking dyke.  She wants my strawberries.  She wants these two balls in a cunt.  Yeah, why would he go after her just for the hell of it when he's trying to make a comedy?  Yeah.  Because now there's nothing funny going to be done that day now that she's annoyed.  It seems like maybe he is a little off with the getting, like she was doing something  and she gets it done and then he makes her change it and change it again and she probably  gets sick of it.  But that's, isn't that part of fucking movie making? 
[00:15:30]  Maybe the guy directed things, hey, I want it done a little different this way.  Take your feet off the fucking desk or move some of that shit around and we'll do it  again.  There are directors that do 50 fucking takes sometimes.  Let me see this twat work with Kubrick.  I know he's dead, but, you know, the guy took fucking 800 takes of a goddamn shot.  Well, it's Kubrick.  Yeah.  You know, what are you going to tell him?  But again, then she's not giving him respect because he's not Kubrick?  Right.  He's the fucking director.  So after the Lily Tomlin tirade there, she was kind of, you know, kind of getting a little 
[00:16:00]  pissed at the director.  The director finally just loses it on her.  Just fucking loses his mind.  And he is knocking props all over the place.  Yeah.  And just really pissed off.  Well, this is the one where she's in the car, right?  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, you're doing that?  Yeah, we're going.  Sorry.  You're jumping around?  Well, it's the next track.  I know what you're talking about.  But the next one is Lily in a car.  She gets so pissed off, she starts telling everyone to fuck themselves, including Dustin 
[00:16:30]  Hoffman, who's in the car with her.  Yeah, she's sitting right next to her.  Doing the scene.  By the way, man, we got funny listeners.  Henry Crinkle from Manhattan.  This is punishment?  Cool.  I'm going to come.  I'm going to come.  Oh, this is a big movie with Dustin Hoffman?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It went nowhere, though.  But I mean, it's still a...  Who saw this?  Is this the Huckabees movie?  Oh, it deserved to go nowhere.  Okay.  Did he do that movie, Midnight Something?  Yeah.  All right, you ready?  Here we go.  Lily in a car. 
[00:17:00]  Leave me the fuck alone!  Do you know what the fuck is going on, period?  Fuck you!  I've had it up to here.  Who's reacting to what, for God's sakes?  Fuck you, motherfucker!  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!  Get the fucking thing together, fuck you!  Oh, yeah, bullshit. 
[00:17:30]  That's right, we spent five or six fucking hours doing something else?  No!  God damn it!  You fucked it up, god damn you!  Now, get straight on it and help!  If you can't help them, help me!  That's right, fuck you, too!  No, I'm not, I'm not, I'm sorry.  You don't care, I don't care.  I'll break the fucking set apart, I don't even give a fuck. 
[00:18:00]  Let them out, because you're there.  Oh, shut up, shut the, you shut the fuck up, too.  I will, but just be there.  Shoot the fucking thing right now.  Oh, yeah, you'll get all the, shoot, I'll be angry as she's angry.  That's a riot.  Yeah, it's just Dustin Hoffman, just shoot, shoot the fucking thing.  Oh, I will, I will shut the fuck up, but first.  Oh, shut up, man.  I can't believe I gotta listen to this cunt, I'm fucking...  Oh, man.  Fuck you, too, you fucking...  Oh.  Do we know the back history here?  Why does he gotta listen to that fucking bitch? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  No surprise, the movie went nowhere.  Dustin Hoffman is an icon.  Yeah.  But what's the back history?  She's into Ratso Rizzo again.  What are you fighting about?  She was doing a scene in the car, and Hoffman was there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty much it.  That's all I know.  Apparently.  Oh, I knew halfway through that.  As he was making this movie, the director intentionally tried to make it very tense around the set.  Like...  Oh, is that what they're trying to say now?  That's what I've read in some article.  Or maybe they wanted her to quit. 
[00:19:00]  Maybe they realized that, you know, it was a mistake having her.  Well, I think...  What's her great contribution anyway?  Laugh-In sucked.  It was lame, wasn't it?  Ronan Martin's Laugh-In.  Yeah.  She was good prior.  I don't know.  She was good, like a sketch show, a prior one, an Emmy writing for her.  I mean, like, that's her.  I remember...  35 years ago, she did something once back when...  I remember once on Laugh-In, there were two flies, and they were talking to each other,  and one said,  Hey, your man's open. 
[00:19:30]  And I actually remember that from Laugh-In.  Hey, uh...  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  You bet your bippy.  Suck it to me.  Reading from Whack Bag.  So I wasn't completely listening, so Lily Tomlin yelled at the director, then gave him  a sloppy blowjob.  Yeah, right?  What the fuck?  After O&A, it's live.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  I am Sam Roberts, as you already knew.  Now, Opie and Anthony, first of all, that was four years ago today. 
[00:20:00]  Lily Tomlin versus David O. Russell coming to the Opie and Anthony show four years ago.  Every time we do these shows, it just reminds all of us here on the staff that we've all  been here way too long.  This is actually the longest, I believe, Opie and Anthony have gone without being fired.  Is that right, E-Rock?  The run that we're on now?  Let's see.  Boston?  Yeah.  Long Island?  New York?  Yes.  Yes.  So congratulations to us.  Actually, I think this might be almost as longer as all three runs before this.  That's incredible.  Well, leave it to SiriusXM to give us the hookup. 
[00:20:30]  Now, Opie and Anthony, they did a lot on the show today, and because of that, they took  about a break and a half for the entire four hours.  So we're going to take a very quick break.  I'm talking three minutes, maybe, and we'll be right back with more after Opie and Anthony  Live.  The virus.  SiriusXM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  The virus.  SiriusXM.  And now, After Opie and Anthony Live continues. 
[00:21:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  More after Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  They're getting ready for Ron and Fez in here.  Apparently, we're switching mic flags in the house.  Mark Zito and Rob Cross.  I see you, Rob Cross.  I know you don't want to be on the air, but you're in the studio.  And I told you many times, Rob, that if you're in this studio in my hour, I'm turning that  mic on.  So is there...  What's the controversy?  What, this one?  Yes, management's on the air, everybody.  What's the controversy...  Thank you, B-Rock.  What's the controversy of the day on your end of the building? 
[00:21:30]  There doesn't seem to be any controversy today.  Come on.  It's only like 11.  It's not even 11 yet.  Yeah, but usually we have something going on by 6.30 or so.  I think we're good today.  And what's going on with the mic flags?  You guys have a box of tools, and Mark Zito's been over there playing with mic flags for  about 20 minutes.  We're going to need at least 35 minutes daily to change the mic flags out.  Oh, Jesus.  I think we can work that in.  Do you guys know that on the radio, the listeners aren't going to be able to see the mic flags? 
[00:22:00]  Do they know what mic flags are?  I doubt it.  It's the little box that goes above the mic flag.  Like, E-Rock, what do you think the odds are that the O&A staff will help the mic flag  switching that's now going on?  Oh, that ain't happening at all.  Never.  Never.  In fact, they'll be screaming at 6 a.m. that it doesn't say Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  Only every day.  Every day you think the mic flag should be switched?  Then you've got to come back and switch it out.  Why don't you just get some white tape and write Ron and Fez on the side?  Oh, E-Rock just said, he didn't have his effort.  E-Rock just said, why don't you just get some white tape and then write Ron and Fez on it  and just stick it onto the sides of the O&A mic flags? 
[00:22:30]  There's four sides, so why not put their name on the flags with ours?  That's crazy, Eric.  What are you, nuts?  What if we could make the magnetic and stick them on?  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  There you go.  Rob Cross, any ideas?  You're a damn genius, Eric.  You're trying to take apart a microphone like a Tinker Toy.  Listen, Eric is already the reason this company has to pinch pennies in certain areas  because all the money's going to him, so I wouldn't give him any promotions anytime soon.  I thought it was just dangling.  We could leave it dangling. 
[00:23:00]  I'm sure Rob Cross heard Anthony's big voicemail extravaganza this morning from this woman  that I guess he had some sort of relationship with.  She was leaving voicemails for him.  We talked to Ant as he was exiting, and this really was as he was exiting.  I had to push Roland out of the way and didn't have time to apologize to him and probably  still won't, but I had to push Roland out of the way so I could get this comment from 
[00:23:30]  Anthony.  It was so worth it.  So, Anthony, before you leave, I had to get through management, and Roland, I apologize.  What is it that makes you so irresistible to females that they have to leave you voicemails  like we heard today?  It's got to be something.  It's the mojo.  To have the mojo.  Is this an ego booster when you get emails like this, or is it a nuisance?  No, it's a complete fucking nuisance.  I hate it. 
[00:24:00]  I'm not stupid.  I never got this kind of shit when I was a tin knocker, so I understand it's having  a giant mansion of a house and a bar and a bowling alley and a movie theater and a fucking  jet port and rockets and hell.  Speaking of that, why don't you go back there now?  To your mansion, I mean.  Oh, that's where I'm going.  Believe me, I've been walking this whole way with you annoying me with this microphone.  Go pick up the shreds and scraps of the show and make something good of it.  I'll try, Ant.  Give it a try. 
[00:24:30]  That's exactly what this show should be called, picking up the scraps and trying to make something  good of it.  We're back with After Obi and Anthony Live, and Rob Cross has left Mark Zito by confronting  Rob Cross on the air just now.  Yes.  Did I just relieve you of Mike Flagg switching duties?  Well, I think I relieved myself in the sense that he came in here and noticed that we have  different microphones than everywhere else in the building, and that made it impossible  to change them out easily every day.  Well, we're special people.  We have special microphones.  I think it's a worthwhile thing.  White tape.  White tape, again. 
[00:25:00]  Iraq is an idea guy.  You can never, and just keep layering the white tape over and over again.  Ant, this isn't the first time that Ant had to deal with a psychotic ex.  And that's not even his ex that was leaving those voicemails today.  It was just some person that he knew for a fleeting moment that just can't let go.  So way back when, though, several years ago, I don't even know the exact date on this, Crazy  Lynn was somebody who had called into the show, was writing letters. 
[00:25:30]  She sent letters to both Opie and Anthony, called one of them daddy, and said the other one  was either the guy she got knocked up by, or that was his son.  Like, they couldn't figure out who was who.  Way to go, Zito.  And they said, yeah, we're just plugging and unplugging mics as we go.  And this Lynn was legitimate, right?  She wasn't just putting on an act.  Uh, no, she sent these letters, they finally got her on the phone, and they still were  trying to figure out what relationship she was saying she had with both of them. 
[00:26:00]  Well, we still got, oh, Mars, Mars, come in here.  Let's see if he'll come in.  He's giving me, he's giving me the shoulders up.  Mars is just walking by.  What the fuck are you doing?  You cannot be doing this shit when this shit is on.  He's, he's talking to you, Zito.  What happened to you, Mark?  Well, well, Sam put it on.  Well, I don't give a fuck.  What do you mean I put it on?  I'm doing a live show.  Look, all I'm saying is when shit gets broken, like your headset that you guys broke, it takes a while  for you to get back, okay?  Don't do that anymore, please.  Thank you.  And don't piss, just don't piss sitting down. 
[00:26:30]  This is why I love After Hoping Anthony Live.  Moments like that is what I've been waiting for, when I could just, E-Rock, you know I've  been waiting for, when I could just turn the mics on and let it happen.  Someone's getting yelled at.  Because this is what happens here.  Mars, Zito just got in trouble because you were plugging and unplugging mics while we were  live.  I mean, I did turn the mic on, but that's because doing a show.  You said to come in here, sound like we're doing a show.  You could have just potted it down.  We're doing a show, baby.  Or you could have waited until a bit was playing.  And a bit is about to be playing.  It's Crazy Lynn on After Hoping Anthony Live. 
[00:27:00]  After O&A Live.  So, I got a letter from one of our listeners in the Massachusetts area, Anthony.  Yes.  And I felt pretty special because she's completely out of her effing mind.  Uh-huh.  But just when you were feeling special, I guess.  I know.  I was bragging about the letter and I was showing you today and you got one today from the same  lady.  I certainly did.  She writes us separately.  And I feel extra, extra special, Opie, because look what I got with mine.  You got a picture.  I got a photo. 
[00:27:30]  This, Jimmy.  You want to take a look?  Oh, wow.  Is that before or after she kidnapped James Collins?  Exactly.  That's what we were thinking.  From the lovely Lynn from Massachusetts, okay?  Lynn from Massachusetts.  Well, the letter starts off, hi, daddy.  Now, that might, in some cases, be kind of cool if the girl is maybe a fan.  Maybe she's got a little something for you.  She's going, oh, hi, daddy.  You know.  Hi, daddy.  A little sick, but could be taken in that context. 
[00:28:00]  Forgive me, please, for not writing for many months.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  Not my son, Joey.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  I'm assuming, yes, it is your son, Joey.  Is that who she's talking about?  Yes.  I've never met my son, Joey.  Dad, I love Anthony's son, Joey, so much.  Mom mailed me $178 for doing good work at her house. 
[00:28:30]  Dad, I am having my dog, Rock, move in with me.  You have no say in it, daddy.  Mom told me you wanted my phone number.  I don't know if I want you to have my phone number, period.  Daddy, I have something to say.  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  What?  Let me read that again because that's exactly what she meant.  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Now, did my son, Joey, get her pregnant, or is she pregnant holding my son, Joey? 
[00:29:00]  The Joey that she talks about that's already living is the same Joey that she's saying she might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Get it?  Has she been having sex with my son, Joey, or is she pregnant with my son, Joey?  Joey's alive already.  Okay.  But now she's talking like Joey's not alive yet.  Right.  Okay.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey. 
[00:29:30]  And I don't think so, but don't tell Grammy White, okay?  Daddy, tell Mom to get out of my apartment.  I'm not in bed with Anthony's son, Joey.  Oh, see?  Maybe she's having sex with Joey.  Ma is a liar.  I have to stop now.  Love, Lynn.  So I was bragging, like, look at what I got today.  And Anthony got a letter from the same lady today.  Fan mail from some flounder.  Yeah, I got the same one. 
[00:30:00]  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  Now, wait, wait.  If she's calling you Daddy, apparently she believes she's your daughter and she's pregnant with Joey.  So, wait, she's my daughter, so I'm Daddy?  Yeah.  But then who are you?  I'm.  Wait, does she start your letter off?  Hi, Daddy.  You're my father-in-law. 
[00:30:30]  How does your letter start?  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  She's your daughter.  I'm Daddy, she's my daughter.  And you're dodging her.  Wait, all right, so wait.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me.  So how are you related to this?  This is like a goddamn David Lynch movie.  It makes no sense.  I think she's married to you, Anthony.  She's married to me?  She's married to you.  You had the son, Joey, that she wants to, I don't know. 
[00:31:00]  Well, let me finish mine, and perhaps it'll open up a whole world of enlightenment.  Maybe the listeners can help us.  All right, start over.  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  I'm going for an upper GI Thursday.  Anthony, I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, the special love he wants.  Anthony, I might be having my Dalmatian Rocky move in with me. 
[00:31:30]  I am very lonesome with my dog.  I want to ask my daddy if he could lend me 15 bucks.  Is Opie your daddy?  Is that what she says?  She wants 15 bucks from you, Opie?  I used the $175 you gave me, Anthony.  I'm afraid of my daddy.  Can you write to me?  I am very, very sorry for not writing to you.  And my daddy. 
[00:32:00]  I feel bad.  I will write to you and dad often as possible.  Take care, love, Lynn.  And according to the photo, how old would you make her?  At least 50.  She looks like she's...  52.  Is that what you're guessing?  I'll go 52.  52.  I'm thinking because of her appearance, she might be younger than she looks,  but it's no younger than very late 40s.  Okay.  But, okay, I'll go with the late 40s, early 50s. 
[00:32:30]  She is overweight.  She is old and matronly looking.  And she's wearing a house dress standing in front of a wall.  Big ass house dresses.  And she does.  Looks like, what's her face there from that Stephen King movie?  Wonderful.  She just looks...  I hate crazy people.  And why are you working with us?  I love them, yeah, right?  You don't understand.  I have no tolerance for the mentally challenged. 
[00:33:00]  I just...  They really annoy me.  Well, this woman is totally...  She's a nut.  Out of her bird.  And, lo and behold...  After ONA.  It's live.  Wow.  A cliffhanger ending.  Yes.  Nice cut.  We're running out of time, so...  I love it.  Everybody's just getting...  No!  That's not the way it happened on the air the first time?  Is that different?  And, lo and behold...  I'm sure we went to break.  Oh, wow.  Ron, did you hear...  Ron Bennington, of course, here from the Ron and Fez show.  Oh, hi, everybody. 
[00:33:30]  Did you hear the saga that Ant was talking about this morning?  All of the voicemails that were being played?  I really have decided that I absolutely need to have this girl in my life.  You want?  Yes.  You like the attention?  Yes!  I want to know someone's willing to kill my rabbit.  Yeah, because she's left him voicemail after voicemail after voicemail.  And the great part about the voicemails were that they were all...  The maximum amount it can be is four minutes.  Yeah.  That's how long they all were until it cuts off after four minutes. 
[00:34:00]  Well, here's what I want from Ant.  I want the voicemails.  I want the pictures of her.  I want a dossier.  If he could just give me a dossier of her.  Another thing...  He's blowing it if he doesn't call her back.  You think this is...  He's making the biggest mistake of his life.  She's the one.  Just the amount of attention and care she'll give him.  I see.  Imagine what she would do with a chicken if she cares this much about you.  All the fixins and everything.  Oh, God.  I hate that word.  Fixins?  Yeah.  Why?  I despise it. 
[00:34:30]  It just makes me remember that the rednecks won the war.  We talked about another thing that came up on O&A today.  And we talked about this at the beginning of After O&A Live.  was Mars, the engineer.  Yeah.  When he takes a shit, he then stands up when it's time to piss because he doesn't want  to piss like a bitch.  Have you ever heard of this happening before?  But then he ends up pissing down into his own shit.  Yeah.  Trying to cut it in half.  And then he said he wipes himself after he pisses. 
[00:35:00]  Well, here's the weird thing.  You remember Al Dukes from the old N.E.W. show?  Of course.  He was on our K-Rock show for a little while.  He can only shit standing up.  What?  He stands and hovers and holds up and shits that way and can't shit any other way.  And we did that on the show at N.E.W.  and a lot of people called and go, yeah, because I don't want to sit and shit.  It's gross.  So he really stands and...  Yeah, they stand.  And he said his biggest problem in the world is that like in a men's bathroom that the 
[00:35:30]  door thing doesn't go all the way to the top.  So he has to crouch a little bit so people don't see the top of his head while he shits.  They just think he's a maniac.  Yeah.  Mark Zito's hurting himself putting that thing up.  I just saw him pinch his finger.  Mark Zito is the illegitimate son of Al Dukes.  That makes sense now.  Yeah.  He's Al Dukes if Al was even more hateable.  Finally, before the other thing that came up on O&A was Jess.  I don't know if you heard this.  This was the first hour. 
[00:36:00]  My fiancee, Jess.  No, I didn't hear this.  She is in the middle...  She's in Brazil right now on a nine-day business trip.  But she is.  They were acting like I had something to worry about.  She does because that's where they do the forbidden dance.  No.  Yeah.  I forget the name of it, but there was a big dance craze down there where the men and  women are just rubbing against each other.  And she looks like a dancer to me.  I mean, she...  Is she a dancer?  She knows how to dance.  And you don't, right?  I'm...  I could dance at a wedding. 
[00:36:30]  No, I mean dance dance.  No.  No.  Like people are getting pregnant dancing.  No, I don't know how to do any of that.  You mean dirty dancing?  But beyond that.  It's the Brazilian thing.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know.  If Fez was here, he would know the name of it.  There was some kind of dance...  The samba?  Tango?  It's insane.  The samba?  No, it's not the samba.  Iraq thought it was...  Lombada?  Lombada?  No, that can't be it.  Eric thought it was the samba.  Mark said it was the lombada.  I don't know what it is.  Mark and his mom dance the Macarena together, so that's their big thing. 
[00:37:00]  By the way, I don't know how much time we have here.  I mean, we're just eating into your time, so...  I don't have any problem with it, because then I'll have to hear what's going on with Fez.  But someone told me that they said they've listened to you with me, they listened to you  on special delivery, and hear you on O&A, and they say...  Uh-huh.  That you are a flirty type of guy, and that you male flirt with the person that you're  talking to.  Well, I try to...  What does that mean, male flirt?  I don't know. 
[00:37:30]  Iraq, have you picked up on this at all?  No, but I am going to pay attention from now on.  But the way that it was sold to me is that whoever's ever talking to him, he giggles at  and finds incredibly interesting and repeats, and I started, you know, I haven't spent  enough time with you on air...  Right.  ...to know that this is your M.O.  Well, I'm not trying to disagree with you on things.  We're just trying...  We're trying to...  Oh, Rod.  We're trying...  I can't laugh at that now, because you'll say I'm giggling. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, beside Dave.  Well, I don't think I do that with Dave.  We have a natural chemistry.  No, you flirt with him.  I don't flirt with Dave.  He's so needy that he loves it, and maybe I fall into this.  Maybe Opie, Dave, and I are all just...  We have an empty spot that somehow you male flirt your way into.  Well, I'd like to think I'd get by on more than that.  Just male flirting?  It seems like you're a male flirt, and I'm going to look into this to see if it exists. 
[00:38:30]  Now, it's funny we bring up Mark Zito.  So, he is confused to be accused, Roland accuses him, of being a male flirt with the morning mash-up.  Whoa.  That he goes down and giggles and follows them around like a puppy.  That's what Roland says.  He does follow them around a little bit.  Yeah.  But, I mean, I don't...  I work here.  Like, I'm not following you around.  I'm doing...  I'm broadcasting with you.  But then you male flirt.  You play up to me somehow.  I don't know.  Well, I am going to play up to you.  I'm definitely...  I was a shop major.  I'm not...  It's not like we're in a position where we're equals here.  You are Ron from the Ron and Fez show, and I'm the guy they stuck at 10 o'clock. 
[00:39:00]  See, that's the thing that Zito never gets.  He doesn't get that.  He's equal with everyone.  Like, we're all in this together.  Like, he did college radio, so he knows.  Yeah, he does college radio, and believe me, when I fucking tell you, I'm going to be...  We know.  Someday you're going to be on top of the world.  Right.  But you have to have respect for the business before then.  Now, to get back to this, though, I'm going to look into you.  I'm going to take...  I'm going to send tapes of you to a psychologist.  That much?  I get very interested in stuff.  Okay. 
[00:39:30]  Should I give out my home number in case the fact that Ant's ex-girlfriend is listening?  Well, she's probably listening.  I mean, he would probably not like it if you referred to her as his ex-girlfriend.  I will tell you this.  The difference between me and Ant is I will pick up.  I'm not going to let that thing go straight to message.  Uh-huh.  What else about me?  Yeah.  Well, hopefully there will be no male flirting today on the Ron and Fez show.  Stop trying to find a transition to end the show.  Oh, seriously.  Well, I mean, it's just like a natural... 
[00:40:00]  Why can't you be like E-Rock?  Boom.  Just cut it off.  The time is up.  It's done.  Do you want me to just hit a sweeper now?  Just slice it.  Anyway, so Ron...
