<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion about the Knicks/Nets game, Mayor Bloomberg's presence, and the sheer size of basketball players, jokingly referred to as "monsters."  This segued into a discussion of Don McClain's comb-over, illustrated with humorous examples from Holy Taco's Google Images, and then to the hosts' football allegiances and predictions regarding Fireman Ed's behavior at the upcoming Jets game.

A substantial portion focused on Anthony Cumia's Twitter feud with Patton Oswalt, sparked by a documentary about small businesses and escalating into a broader political debate.  The hosts detailed the vitriol from both sides, with Cumia contrasting the "douchebaggery" between left and right-wing users.  They also discussed a seemingly unprovoked, emotional tweet from Ralphie May, prompting Cumia to express frustration with May's interrupting style and loud laugh from past appearances;  audio clips of May's laugh were requested but not immediately played.  The conversation broadened to online disputes and celebrity Twitter deletions, including Chris Brown's feud with Jenny Johnson and Elizabeth Hasselbeck's use of "verbal rape" to describe Brown's comments.  The hosts debated the appropriateness of banning offensive users and the hypocrisy they perceived in Whoopi Goldberg's reaction. The segment concluded with observations on online personas and a brief discussion about the Elmo character and the accusations against his voice actor, along with a mention of the naked cowboys and cowgirls in Times Square.


The show then addressed Ralphie May's absence, reiterating complaints about his loud laugh and interruptions.  This transitioned into a discussion about a morbidly obese woman who died and couldn't fly, and her husband's subsequent lawsuit, briefly including a calculation of the average person's leg weight percentage. A significant portion focused on a scathing critique of a young, religious actor from "Two and a Half Men" who publicly denounced the show's content while remaining employed.  The hosts expressed anger at his perceived hypocrisy, speculating on his motivations and suggesting sexually suggestive and insulting future storylines for his character.  Studio guests Ray Liotta and Steve-O were present.  The segment involved playing and criticizing clips from various movies and commercials (including a Brad Pitt commercial deemed "retarded," "First Blood," and "Tango & Cash"), laced with profanity and mockery.  The show concluded this section by revisiting photos from a past "Teen Week" segment, focusing on a girl with exceptionally hairy buttocks, which prompted further ribald discussion.


A further segment began with a discussion of Facebook privacy and celebrity, leading to reminiscences about past show segments, including vulgar and sexually explicit descriptions of Frenchie and a particularly outrageous segment featuring "Gay Marco" performing a sexual act on-air for NSYNC tickets; audio of this segment was played.  The hosts showed photos of a dog named Dexter and Jay Moore with Marco, interspersed with sexually explicit jokes and recollections of past stunts.  They then discussed the logistical and legal difficulties of such content. The latter half featured an in-studio interview with Ray Liotta promoting "Killing Them Softly."  The conversation covered Liotta's experiences filming, his poker playing, his celebrity photo collection, past roles (including his soap opera experience), and the true crime film "The Iceman."  The segment concluded with more reminiscing about past antics.


Ray Liotta's interview continued, beginning with anecdotes about his early career and a humorous story about meeting Martin Scorsese.  The discussion shifted to George Harrison's documentary, before promoting "Killing Them Softly."  The Who Kid entered, primarily to get a photo with Liotta, leading to a racist joke. The conversation covered The Who Kid's experience on *The Voice*, comparisons between *Goodfellas* and *Scarface*, graphic descriptions of violent movie scenes, speculation about Liotta's former soap opera co-star Bradley Bliss, and a lengthy, vulgar anecdote from The Who Kid about his encounters with Steve-O, Kid Rock, and various women. Steve-O then joined, contributing further explicit anecdotes, including ejaculating on a young actor's headshot and details about his new show.  The Who Kid then discussed his stand-up and a story about meeting Old Dirty Bastard.


Finally, the show featured Steve-O recounting a bizarre incident at an ODB tribute show involving stripping naked, performing a self-described "double back back flip" with his genitals, and being confronted by Raekwon, who violently grabbed him and called his actions "faggotry."  Steve-O detailed other extreme stunts (jumping from a plane without a parachute, injecting vodka intravenously, being strangled unconscious), a past altercation with a pilot, and interactions with various celebrities: Lindsay Lohan (whose wallet he found and used for leverage), Paris Hilton (negative experience), and 50 Cent (who launched him down a staircase).  He recounted making a mixtape with G-Unit, freely insulting rappers. RZAâ€™s past appearance on the show and encounter with Steve-O at the VMAs were mentioned.  The conversation concluded with further discussion of Raekwon and Steve-O's desire to make amends, with The Who Kid present for the final moments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Mmm, good morning! Hi!  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Knicks lost last night, huh?  The Battle of New York.  Is that what it is?  You got the New York Knicks, then you got the Brooklyn Nets.  Brooklyn Nets.  First meeting as far as the Nets now being the Brooklyn Nets. 
[00:00:30]  A lot of stars at the game.  Oh, I bet.  Even Mayor Bloomberg was at the game.  Of course, I bet he's a big b-ball fan.  Sure, now that, you know, the Hurricane Sandy thing is all taken care of,  it's time to relax and enjoy some b-ball.  Yeah, I wouldn't sweat it.  Nets beat them.  I just like when they run around and pass the ball.  Well, it shows the teamwork. 
[00:01:00]  We should go with putting some planters on the court to make it nice like Times Square.  He likes looking at monsters.  Oh, boy.  Basketball players are monsters.  You have no idea until you go to a game, and if you're fortunate enough to sit, you know,  down closer to the court, you realize they're just monsters.  They are giant people.  When you see them on TV, they're all monsters, so they all just look like normal people.  Yeah.  But when you see them as far as when, just when they run to the sideline, 
[00:01:30]  because maybe a ball's going out of bounds, and you just see they're just monsters.  How do you get that big?  Also, we've had a few basketball players here in the studio, but there's one at a time.  Right.  And when they come in that door, you're just like, oh, my God, that guy's a giant.  And then if you're courtside, that's got to be amazing to just see an entire court full  of these giant monsters.  Monsters.  I like calling them monsters.  Yeah, we've had some tall guys in here.  We've had three really tall guys in the studio. 
[00:02:00]  You know what they would be if they ordered some mashed potatoes?  Monster Mash.  Monster Mash.  Monster Mash.  You've got to say the mash.  You've got more than three.  No.  Two of the Globetrotters?  They weren't.  They were big guys, though.  One was a big guy.  The other guy was six-something.  I'm talking like monsters.  Tiny was a monster.  Crazy.  Was Tiny the tall guy?  Shaq's crazy big.  Shaq was crazy big.  Kareem was crazy big.  Tiny from the Globetrotters, crazy big.  That's all I got.  Clyde Frazier.  Dr. J. 
[00:02:30]  They're big guys.  They might be small, but they're like 6'8".  I mean, 6'7".  I guess you might be right.  But when they have to duck down to get in here.  I know.  That's got to be a hassle.  Shaq had to duck down.  Tiny had to duck down.  Kareem, forget about it.  Poor Kareem was on a Macy's Day float.  What?  He was?  Look, man.  For the most part, if you're on a Macy's Day float, you're a loser in the entertainment business.  I'm sorry, but you are. 
[00:03:00]  Because most entertainers want to, you know, they have status where they can just fly home to their families.  Yeah.  And there was Kareem on the front of a float.  Oh, man.  Looking kind of sad and miserable.  Like, you can't put Kareem on a Macy's Day float.  I guess they did.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  I guess they did.  Did you see Don McClain?  I know we did our Thanksgiving shit yesterday, but did you see Don McClain?  Oh, God, yes.  Singing his American Pie.  Yes.  With his whacked out hair.  His fucking dry comb over. 
[00:03:30]  He's the only other guy that has the Donald Trump.  Yeah.  Whatever the Donald Trump is, it looks like Don McClain is sporting the same type of shit.  Yeah, just some dry tumbleweed brushed over.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty bad.  Why wouldn't you give up on that?  I know, being a guy, you know, losing your hair sucks.  But it gets to a point, it just looks better.  It just, it's crazy.  His parts started almost below his ear, which I don't even think is possible.  Oh, my God.  Look at the part on the side. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, God, it looks like wires.  You know what?  It looks like you opened up a big conduit.  That's, that's a good picture of him.  Yeah.  It looks way fucking worse.  You can see, look where the part is.  No one parts the hair all the way down there.  It's just over the top of his ear.  And then the wind blows and that shit starts flying out to the side.  Oh, God damn.  How the fuck does any woman fuck you?  No.  How the fuck?  Like, there's nothing funnier than when that wind blows and that fucking shit goes straight 
[00:04:30]  out sideways.  And it's all hair sprayed down.  So, so it moves in a mass like this.  Bill Murray.  Yeah, exactly.  It's the Bill Murray.  Bill Murray had it in Kingpin.  We'll call it that.  Are there any legitimate pictures of comb over wind blow pictures?  That would be a great website.  Let's see.  That would be a great website.  Look, we all do what we can to keep our hair and shit.  Yeah.  But it absolutely gets to a point where you got to go, ah, fuck it. 
[00:05:00]  Donald's hair's all over the place there.  Who's that?  It's blowing like crazy.  That's why I love this show.  I really do.  Because we weren't even going to talk about this.  And now we got Google images of a whole bunch of guys with that fucking hair flying out  to the side.  Some of these comb over pictures are a goof, obviously, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But some of them are the real deal.  I like the three or four strands. 
[00:05:30]  You know.  That just are brushed in front.  Oh, right.  Like the guy's just in front of the mirror going, yeah, that's it.  It's just the front.  And it's greasy.  Yeah, yeah, because they got to grease it down.  They got to grease it down.  Look at that.  What's that guy trying to do there?  Why would you try and just fucking give up on it?  He's combing like, they got to be maybe, the longest one is four inches long.  It doesn't even cover his head.  Right.  But he's trying to brush that over so it only goes a third of the way up his head.  Not even, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's got the horseshoe baldness. 
[00:06:00]  But he's trying to push some of the shit toward the top of his head.  Oh, my God.  That's for his eyeline in the mirror.  Like, when he can convince himself that it doesn't look that bad when he looks himself  in the eye.  He tilts his head back and over.  He looks and goes, yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Anyone looking at me through a peephole would probably think I look all right.  Man.  Yeah, but I saw the Don McClane, and he was singing the American Pie song there.  You know, Whiskey and Rye and all that shit.  Yes, he was.  Long, long time ago.  Drove my Chevy to the levee. 
[00:06:30]  And my comb-overs drive.  Still a good song, I guess.  Oh, I'm so sick of that song.  And it's too long.  What do you mean it's too long?  Oh, it goes on forever, that's all.  AM radio would play the edit.  Oh, maybe.  Keep it nice and short.  Oh, God.  What's that guy trying to do?  Wow, from the back.  He went from the back.  Lower back of the head all the way to the top.  All the way up.  With the fucking swoop.  Forward.  Damn.  That's a crazy-ass comb-over. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  That's, I feel bad when I see, there's a guy that will drive me in LA sometimes, and he  has one, and I feel bad.  Like, Jesus, are you trying to hold on?  Like, let it go.  What are you doing?  Just be the age you are.  But what?  He would probably look all right if he just shaved the shit.  Right, he would look better.  There's some great ones.  Yeah, Giuliani did the horrible comb-over for a while.  Oh, God.  Look at that guy.  What site is this?  This site is...  It's Holy Taco.  Holy Taco.  It's a gallery of awesomely bad comb-overs.  Yeah, I know the Holy Taco. 
[00:07:30]  Holy Taco has some good shit from time to time.  Oh, God.  Oh, shit.  You were saying something there.  But even worse, I guess, would have to be the hairpiece.  I don't know.  I don't know what's worse.  The comb-over or the hairpiece.  There's some horrendous hairpieces out there.  The bad hairpiece is really bad.  The dog's got a comb-over.  There you go.  That's what we're talking about.  Yeah, look at that.  Looks like someone just rested a rake on the top of his head. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it's a rake-over.  I like that guy.  It's blown out.  The one before him.  Oh, yeah.  That guy had a bad time in the wind.  Yeah, that's the kingpin.  Look at how greasy that is.  We'll put this gallery up on our Facebook page.  Gianni was rocking the comb-over for a while.  Yes, he was.  As prosecutor.  I don't know.  What star of this?  Oh, Don McClane, I guess.  Don McClane and his horrible dry comb-over.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Who's that? 
[00:08:30]  The story from Kingpin.  Bill Murray from Kingpin.  Of course.  He's got to end up on all of these lists.  Fuck, yeah.  Such a great movie.  Oh, my God.  That's fantastic.  So, what do we got today?  The Knicks.  That's for the New York people there, right?  Yes.  Monday Night Football, Panthers beat the Eagles 30-22.  I'm out as far as football goes.  I don't have a fucking team.  Well, it's the Jets.  What team can I jump on right now?  I need a fucking team. 
[00:09:00]  Who's doing well?  Well, my second team usually, which is a little strange, is the Buffalo Bills because  of my time in Western New York.  They're in the same division, which makes it strange.  But they suck, too, right now.  So, I don't have a fucking team.  So, I got to go San Francisco Giants.  Let's do this.  Got to pick somebody.  I don't know if football is good enough for anything.  I feel all emasculated a lot of times when somebody can just rattle off player names  and what they do and what they did.  And I'm just kind of like, I have no idea what they're even talking about. 
[00:09:30]  Man, you should get into football.  No.  It's so much better than baseball.  No.  It really is.  No.  Nothing better when the weather starts changing and you just fucking sit down and watch football  all day on a Sunday.  See, I'd rather watch other stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pats?  Yeah.  Let's do the Pats this year.  Fuck it.  Pats?  Yeah, we did some time in Boston.  Fuck it.  That's crazy.  Why?  Now you're talking crazy.  Why?  I can't be in New York and like any of those teams from up there. 
[00:10:00]  How's Fireman Ed today?  Is he all right?  Is he hurting?  I don't know.  Did you apologize to him?  I don't think I had anything to do with that shit.  No, I think you did it.  You think?  Yeah.  I'd love to take credit for that one.  Fuck it.  I don't know if I'm going to get the credit.  Is he hurting?  Fuck it, man.  I'm sure he is.  I'm sure his life is like just sitting there going, ah, everybody talks.  How you doing, Ed?  Ah, you know how it is.  Ah, ha.  Like, it's all about him.  Of course. 
[00:10:30]  It's all about Ed.  I can't wait to see Sunday because he will be in that stadium.  And they'll get it.  And New Yorkers are douchebags.  We all know that, obviously.  We live here.  You know they're going to be like, come on, Ed.  But they don't mean it.  They're going to try to get it.  He's just going to be.  He's going to have to shake his head.  He's going to stand up and do the half standing up wave to people.  Like, I'll acknowledge everybody.  I'm a big fan.  But, you know, I'm just going to sit here and watch the game.  You think he's going to get a standing ovation for his time served?  Oh, good.  With the Jets organization?  They have to acknowledge all the, everything he did for the New York Jets. 
[00:11:00]  And he's going to be like, well, oh.  And I think he, somewhere along the line goes, okay, for old time's sake, one more.  What the hell?  Here it is.  Oh, never mind.  This big moment.  Yeah, because he just can't leave it alone.  He's got to make it about himself.  I have a feeling it's going to be very douchey this weekend.  They are at home, right?  I think they are.  Douchey.  I believe so, right?  Yeah.  You think firing it will wave him off at first?  Yeah, of course he will.  He'll be like, no, no, no. 
[00:11:30]  Come on.  I'm just like you normal people.  I'm watching the game.  And then the New Yorkers are going to just be dicks.  Yeah.  But he's not going to know they're being dicks because I think he's a little clueless as  far as that shit goes.  Come on, Ed.  Because his ego is out of control.  And then he'll finally stand up.  All right.  Let's do this.  He'll probably get all tired of just watching the game and not being big fireman Ed that  he's got to do something.  I'm sure he'll make an excuse like something.  You know, I was just going to retire, but then I got a letter from a young boy with 
[00:12:00]  cancer.  And he's like, all right, Ed.  That's how he's going to bring himself back in.  He said, Ed, will you help us cheer every week?  Yes.  And I thought it was my responsibility to continue to do this.  Oh, my God.  Mark these words because this will happen.  You think they're going to give him a microphone to talk to the crowd?  I just want to thank everybody for your support over the years, over the years, over the  years, over the years.  It's about bringing people together.  Together.  Together.  Together. 
[00:12:30]  Today.  Today.  I am the douchiest man.  Douchiest.  Douchiest.  Douchiest.  Yeah.  That'll be fun TV, but it never works out.  It'll just be a fucking who cares event.  No one will care but Ed.  These are all these dumb dreams I have in my own head that I just assume will happen,  and they never happen.  No one will care but Ed.  Stupid Ed.  Where will we be looking for him?  Where is he?  Is he here?  Where's Ed?  And then there'll be a press conference.  I felt like I should just stay away from the game. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't want to bring attention to myself.  As he's bringing attention to himself.  Of course.  To tell everyone he didn't want to bring attention to himself.  It's all about Ed.  Yeah.  All right.  I got a little bit of a brawl last night on the Twitter.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Did you?  And it just didn't have anything to do with it.  Like, of course, we've had Patton Oswalt on the show.  Yeah.  He's a great guy.  I love Patton.  He's fun.  I love him on the show.  And fun guy.  He certainly thinks differently than you.  Yeah.  Is the headline here. 
[00:13:30]  But who cares?  That's nothing to do with everything.  Believe me.  So he brought up this documentary about these two small businesses in Los Angeles.  Right.  One's a paper company.  It's been there forever.  And another one's a printing company.  And I guess they work with each other.  And they're falling on very, very hard times.  And, you know, their future is definitely in question.  One paper and one printing company.  Yeah, yeah.  But aren't those businesses sort of going away? 
[00:14:00]  They are kind of archaic.  But...  How do you keep that shit going?  I don't know.  I hate paper at this point.  Ah, paper.  This guy, a lot of invitations and stuff the printer makes.  Right.  You know, it's pretty interesting seeing how he does things.  So is it a company that could survive?  I don't know.  I guess.  Evites.  You don't get invitations anymore.  You get evites.  That's true.  You get emails or text messages.  Yeah, it's all about the evites.  It could just be the fact that, yeah.  That the future is kind of plowing over them. 
[00:14:30]  I think it might be.  The future is plowing over them.  You don't want to run a typewriter company at this point, right?  Yeah.  But Patton, he posted the link to the documentary.  Said, just check this out for nine minutes.  You know, whatever.  And I did.  I watched it.  It was cool.  It was, you know, interesting to see this.  And it was a little thought-provoking on the fact that it could just be the future plowing  over these poor guys or the economy or who knows what it is.  So he said, you know, we got to support these guys and make sure they don't fail and things 
[00:15:00]  like that.  Noble effort.  But I just happened to point out the fact that if you pushed Obama for months and months  on end for the election and then you turn around and want to help small business, I  mean, it's â€“ and I don't want to get â€“ I'm bringing up our discussion last night.  I'm not getting into this argument anew here on the show, so forget it.  If you disagree, I'm sorry.  But it seems to me like his plans for the future, for taxes, what he's done over the 
[00:15:30]  past four years, hasn't really been a juggernaut of small â€“ for small business.  That's all I'm saying.  Whether you agree or not, whatever the details you want to throw in, tweet me later.  But for right now, that was my tweet to Patton Oswalt.  Yeah, but what â€“ oh, God, right?  Exactly.  So Patton Oswalt, he responded.  He was like, well, what do you mean?  You know, what â€“ and so we just â€“ we started getting into the most civil, nice discussion 
[00:16:00]  about that.  Both sides trying to make their points.  Exactly.  Well, we got surrounded by each other's fans, and it â€“ they were fucking animals.  You fucking cunts!  You fucking libtard dickbag!  Fuck you!  Your candidate likes magic hats!  And fucking â€“ you religious piece of shit! 
[00:16:30]  And â€“ what?  What?  What?  We were having a civil discussion, and everyone piled on, just piled on, repugnant.  Isn't that type of irrational anger uncomfortable?  Yes!  So you guys obviously can handle a little heated debate, a lively debate, as people like  to say.  So I started â€“ I noticed a few things that were really just kind of â€“ oh, brother. 
[00:17:00]  And I know the right has a bunch of douchebags, but there's a different type of douchery on  the left.  And since I lean more right, I notice the douchery more on the left.  Do you actually lean right at this point?  I lean.  I'm far from religious right.  Believe me.  You're on the floor.  Believe me.  So this one guy was actually a professor.  A professor.  And he writes, oh, Patton, you're going to fall for this?  Trolls like garbage. 
[00:17:30]  Meanwhile, if you read our posts, you would see it was a civil discussion based on each  other's opinions and what we've garnered from the information we've gotten over the  years.  And he, as a professor, was just discounting whatever the fuck I said, calling it trolling  because I didn't â€“ he didn't agree with my point?  Right.  That shit, to me, is more fucking obnoxious than someone just writing, hey, dumb cunt. 
[00:18:00]  That, to me, is somebody â€“ he's in the schools.  He's the one that's supposedly teaching.  Right.  And he can't even grasp the fact that we have differing opinions.  We're having an open, civil dialogue with each other, albeit surrounded by savagery.  But this guy â€“ that annoyed me more than any of the cunts.  And then it's like, get a brain, Anthony.  You get that from people. 
[00:18:30]  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Get a brain because I decided to take up a discussion with a man of a differing viewpoint?  It astounds me.  It's fun, though, right?  How stupid people are.  It is fun.  It's kind of fun.  And then â€“  Your big mistake is trying to reason with the idiots out there.  I know.  They're just idiots.  I try, but it's â€“  You try to hit these idiots with actual facts and knowledge, and they â€“ 
[00:19:00]  What is that?  I know.  No, I'm telling you, this is how it is.  And I'm sorry.  It is very difficult to explain Obama's tax code and how it will affect the economy in â€“  140 characters?  140 characters that Twitter allots you.  You know, it's a little difficult.  Yeah, because the continued tweet never works.  I don't know.  That just gets lost somewhere in the timeline.  And the tweet longer.  Oh, I never do tweet longer.  Well, I got one of those last night, too. 
[00:19:30]  In the middle of my discussion with Patton Oswalt and fending off these fucking assholes that were not understanding what we were doing,  I get a tweet from a â€“  From a weepy fucking â€“  Dude.  Ralphie May.  I like Ralphie.  Oh. 
[00:20:00]  I do like Ralphie.  I do, too.  Look, I have no problem with Ralphie.  He's such a sweet guy.  Except for what I said.  And all I said â€“  What was his tweet again?  Because it was uncomfortable.  You got to read his tweet.  First, let me tell you what I said.  Let everybody know what I said.  He sounded very â€“  He sounded â€“  Sounded?  It's Twitter.  I felt like I was reading something from John Candy.  From Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  Yeah.  It had that tone to his tweet.  You might not find it. 
[00:20:30]  He might have deleted it.  Really?  I don't know why he would do that either, but â€“  You got to find the tweet.  So I get the tweet, and â€“  Well, first of all, I was on Live from the Compound one night.  And, of course, I'm just pounding fucking drinks and having fun and shit.  And someone called up and asked why Ralphie May hasn't been on this show in a while.  So I said, I don't know, you know, whatever it is.  And then I started getting into a little discussion about Ralphie.  And â€“  I'm sure you're downplaying how it was presented on Live from the Compound.  Well, think of me yelling and drunk. 
[00:21:00]  Of course.  Of course it was obnoxious.  I'm not saying it wasn't.  I'm sure it wasn't a reasonable answer when you were doing it on Live from the Compound.  No, no, it wasn't reasonable.  But the gist of it was that it's â€“ when he comes in here, it's very difficult to get a word in edgewise.  And the way we do a show, it's a back-and-forth discussion.  It's not really a lot of zingers and one-liners that come out.  It's a lot of discussion.  You've got to build your story and things like that.  And it's very frustrating when you're starting to build it and Ralphie would just â€“ 
[00:21:30]  and kind of derail what you're saying.  Point number two was Ralphie's laugh.  Even the microphones can't handle Ralphie's laugh.  Can we get the Ralphie laugh?  It distorts â€“  E-Rock, you've got a job today.  Find me a couple of Ralphie May laugh clips, please.  Yeah, yeah.  Because then maybe Ralphie would understand what I'm saying.  Like a dumb E-Rock is probably looking up the month of May.  Everything wrong.  Boo.  Sorry.  And you moved on from it, but we probably should have Patton Oswalt on if you had this big thing happening last night. 
[00:22:00]  No, I was thinking that too, but that doesn't even matter.  It's like we're done.  Yeah, I know, but it would be fun to have â€“ first of all, he's good on the show,  and you guys had a thing last night, so we probably should have talked to him today.  Yeah, I haven't been live, I think, but I don't know.  I mean, we're â€“ yeah, maybe to talk about the Twitter thing, sure.  That's what I mean.  But, yeah, I mean, I have no â€“ and people have no problem with Patton Oswalt.  Jesus.  People are fucking crazy.  I read that, and I'm like, what were people upset about? 
[00:22:30]  There was nothing nasty between â€“  Nothing.  Like, what babies?  They are fucking babies.  I read that professor's tweet.  What a little cunt.  Are you really â€“ and I read what you â€“ I'm like, wow, that must have been something said,  and it was nothing.  Nothing.  I'm like, that little banter between two people that know â€“ between people that know each other.  Yeah.  Patton, why are you entertaining this troll?  Troll?  Troll?  Troll?  I'm fucking making a discussion about fucking taxes and the economy and small business. 
[00:23:00]  And nothing â€“ there was nothing nasty in any of the tweets between me and Patton.  Right.  Nothing.  But peripheral people, holy fuck.  Unbelievable.  So did you write Ralphie back?  Well, it was in the middle of the Patton Oswalt thing.  So all I wrote â€“ I retweeted his tweet and just put, oh, Jesus Christ.  At the bottom.  Jesus Christ.  Isn't that a long time ago that Ralphie made that?  Yes. 
[00:23:30]  And then Ralphie wrote back.  He's like, oh, that's all you have to say?  Oh, Jesus.  And then put something like, well, you know â€“ something about having â€“  Then you should call the show, too.  Giving me more credit than that.  And then â€“ and I just â€“ I just put, Ralphie â€“ I go, you a stand-up comic?  Question mark?  And I put, relax.  Fucking relax.  His feelings are probably hurt.  Fuck his feelings being hurt.  We all get our fucking feelings hurt.  He's hurt.  I'm just saying.  He's hurt.  It's the dumb â€“ 
[00:24:00]  He's hurt by your words.  People get their feelings hurt.  It's the dumb industry we're in.  The day that doesn't go by that you don't look at something that should hurt your feelings.  He's probably â€“  Toughen up.  He's probably feeling like an easy target.  I just see John Candy.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  But a guy likes you.  He feels comfortable.  He has probably very affectionate feelings for you.  Well, that's fair.  I like Ralphie.  There's not a â€“ I don't not like Ralphie.  I pointed out a few things. 
[00:24:30]  I bet you his wife likes him.  And his friends like him.  My wife likes me.  My friends like me.  I bet you his fans like him.  I like me.  I bet you he's the general â€“  the general.  Jesus.  I fucked her up.  I'm the genuine article.  The genuine article.  The genuine article.  I also fucked up my football pick.  Holy fuck, I'm getting killed.  I actually said the San Francisco Giants.  Oh, really?  Whoops.  Well, that would have been a good thing to bet.  I would never go New York Giants or New Jersey Giants.  Never.  No.  I don't do that shit.  I'm a Jets fan. 
[00:25:00]  So I'll take a peek at the 49ers and I'll take a peek at the Pats.  Oh, boy.  Anyway, continue.  Sorry.  I have to make that correction because people can't move on with their lives.  Is that the tweet?  You found the tweet.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Anthony, why did you say all that cunty shit about me?  All right.  Now you're just rubbing him in.  No.  What the fuck did I ever do to you?  Hey, you guys don't want me on the show. 
[00:25:30]  See, this is â€“  I know, you guys.  This is John Candy shit.  Hey, you guys don't want me on the show?  That's cool.  Whatever.  But that shit was uncalled for.  You got a problem with me?  By all means, it would take your producers two phone calls or less to get my number.  You could talk to me like a fucking man.  Oh, God.  First of all, stop with the fucking man stuff.  All right?  Stop it.  Jesus.  And cunty shit?  If that's cunty shit, man, boy, you got thin skin. 
[00:26:00]  I don't think that's cunty shit.  That's pretty â€“  It's whatever it was.  Pretty brazen.  Cunty's more like what?  Yeah.  Underhanded, kind of like what?  What would be a good example of cunty shit?  I don't know.  Jimmy?  But that ain't it.  Tell me how.  Cunty shit?  Yeah, but that's more like â€“  It's just talking about the show.  It was nothing personal.  I never get personal with them.  There's a couple guys that have an out-of-control laugh that we have a problem with.  I'll tell you what was cunty shit. 
[00:26:30]  Like, I got a guy who I knew â€“ he was kind of a â€“ he was one of these hangers-on  who had been around for a while, but I knew he was kind of a douche because he had blasted  me at one point years ago, and then we talked, and then he did it again recently, and I'm  like, enough with this cocksucker.  Yeah.  You're a cunt.  Write it down.  I don't remember his name.  I know his face.  I don't know.  I know his first name.  I was listening.  He's just a cunt.  And I'm like, why did I ever â€“ 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  That guy's got major fucking problems.  Yeah.  He's just a jerk.  And then he makes believe he doesn't trash you when he sees you.  One of those twats.  He's a fucking cunt, hanger-on, little baby boy.  Sorry that you're not a part of the show anymore.  Sorry.  Part of the show.  Well, you know what I'm saying.  Like, associated in any way.  He was never an on-air guy.  No.  But whatever.  I just smashed him on Twitter and just blocked him.  I don't mind a guy who I know â€“ if I know you,  and you come at me like some anonymous guy who I don't know â€“ 
[00:27:30]  Right.  That's different.  It's like the way you and Patton went at it was not nasty.  No.  I don't want somebody I know addressing me.  Right.  But it was just like one of these, like, oh, I thought you were better than that.  Like, one of the â€“ bye, scumbag.  See you later.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  I forget you're alive until you pipe up.  Right.  I literally â€“ if that guy fucking shot himself, I would forget he ever existed.  And I wouldn't grieve.  Mm-hmm.  So go away.  It's good to know he does it to everybody. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, he's a cunt.  And then he comes up to you and makes believe, you know, your pals and â€“  Oh, I hate him.  What's the rest of the Ralphie tweet?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was it.  I read it all.  Fucking man.  Yeah.  First of all, it says, hey, you guys don't want me on the show.  I said what I said.  Yeah, man.  Don't talk to me, Ralphie.  Because they do that with you and me and you.  We're separate people.  It's like when we address things, whether it's here on the air or on Twitter or any 
[00:28:30]  other media, medium, we're saying it individually.  I don't put a blanket fucking Opie and Anthony show stamp on what I say.  No, we are â€“  So, no, it wasn't you guys don't want me on the show.  And I didn't say I don't want you on the show.  I said you fucking cut everyone off in the middle of talking and your laugh fucking kills.  It kills the fucking everything.  It's like a superhero sound. 
[00:29:00]  Iraq, you got examples?  Yeah, you make, you know, fucking â€“ we're still pulling through stuff.  All right, yeah, give me a few.  That'd be nice.  Yeah.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  And then â€“ and talk to me like a fucking man.  Yeah.  That's just â€“ that's just gay.  I hate that line.  That's just gay.  Oh, I'm not a man because â€“ what about â€“ I'm hiding?  Well, wouldn't he be a man and just call a show today?  No one's refused his â€“ we haven't ever looked down and seen Ralphie Mae. 
[00:29:30]  Wow, don't pick him up.  I'm not â€“ and I'm sitting there during commercials going, don't pick it up.  I'm not a man.  Fuck you, wigger.  What?  Well, he fucking needs to get me pissed now.  What?  Oh, he is.  Stop it.  Isn't he a figure?  We'll be real here.  No.  Oh, geez.  I tried.  All right, now it is.  You guys.  What?  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you.  No, I'm just fucking â€“  He really is whiny. 
[00:30:00]  Twitter's getting out of control, I think.  It really is.  It might be time to shut down Twitter.  It has completely changed the way people discuss things, argue.  Every aspect of a personal relationship, whether it be just something fleeting and a comment  or very personal and deep discussion, has been absolutely changed by Twitter.  Know who can't handle Twitter are real celebrities. 
[00:30:30]  They just can't handle it.  You're going to see more and more of these real celebrities.  I'm talking about the big stars.  Backing off.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What?  Chris Brown, he fucking shut down.  The leader's account.  Chris Brown.  Do you think his peeps told him to do that?  Ashton Kutcher, he shut down.  Yeah, yeah.  Is he off Twitter?  Unless he came back.  He gave it to his people like a baby, which annoyed me.  Oh, right.  Well, that's what I mean by shut down.  But Chris Brown was getting into nasty back and forths.  Whether you delete your account or give it to someone else, that's shutting down. 
[00:31:00]  That's not the essence of Twitter.  And it was this girl, I don't know, or Jenny Johnson.  I think she's a comedy writer.  I've been following Jenny Johnson since Twitter started, man.  She's one of the best follows out there.  And she's been beating up Chris Brown for a while.  Which is fair.  She was beating him up.  But if he hits back, I mean, even though the guy is kind of shitty, but if he hits back  and blasts you back, people are saying, like, oh, he went on a sexist rant.  It's like, man, look, if she's smashing him on Twitter, even though what he did was fucked  up, he has every right to come back and say something shitty back. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  You can't get in a guy's face and say, fuck you, you're a piece of shit, and then when  he goes, fuck you, bitch, I'll shit in your mouth, you go, whoa, wait a minute.  Is she saying that?  I don't think she's playing the victim.  I'm just saying that that's what happened.  Yeah, because I've never got that impression from her on Twitter.  She's pretty fucking brave.  Other people are saying that.  No, the sexist.  Oh, other people are saying that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we got who said it.  Yeah.  Who said it?  The rant about, oh, he did a sexist rant.  I'm not a Chris Brown fan, but guess what? 
[00:32:00]  Guess the fuck what?  When it comes down to Elizabeth Hasselbeck or Chris Brown, Chris Brown for the fucking  win, always.  And Team Breezy are a bunch of fucking animals.  Oh, I've had some fun with them.  Oh, God.  Andy Levy fucking gets into it with them all the time, and it's hilarious.  Yeah.  They are fucking animals.  They were calling for her death.  That's just so funny.  You can kill her with the best grammar you'll ever read on Twitter, by the way.  Just put...  Amazing. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Though.  Yeah, though in the search.  You'll get some great tweets.  When you delete 5 million people, can you get...  Or 11 million followers?  I guarantee you his rep just said, this is...  You're just...  All you're doing is fucking ruining record sales.  You're hurting your career.  In the end, it doesn't matter to those guys how many followers they got, really, right?  Team Breezy.  No, they care about that.  They care.  Sure, man.  They're just like us.  Bunch of obese black women fucking clamoring over this fucking woman beater.  Unbelievable. 
[00:33:00]  Has he...  Let me ask you honestly.  Why?  Because I think he's shitty, and I hate the way the music industry...  He seems to be a shitty person.  Won't allow certain guys back on their shows, but if him or Kanye do whatever it is they  do, they're welcome back.  Kanye can take an award out of Taylor Swift's hand.  It's a black thing.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  But Tommy Lee beat up Pam Anderson.  He was forgiven.  I mean, it was like...  Meaning, it's not all you hear about with Tommy Lee.  He tries to be black.  Yes, he does.  Remember his rap album?  Yeah.  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  He's...  Yeah, that's a good point.  You know what?  It's all cock.  After that cock thing came out... 
[00:33:30]  Carte Blanche.  But I'm saying, has he been forgiven or other performers?  Sean Connery has fucking batted around women.  Yeah, they get forgiven.  That was in the days where, you know, you could.  Well, they asked for it.  They asked for it.  In general, they get forgiven.  Absolutely.  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Hasselbeck.  Had this to say yesterday.  What a dope.  Not even worse, though.  He said something about...  Yeah, my mom actually told me to pretty much...  I hope. 
[00:34:00]  What is that line?  Did they bleep it out?  Shit in her eye.  That's what he was saying.  He wanted to shit in her eye, I guess, or her retina.  Chris Brown said that?  Yeah.  I hope.  Hashtag pink eye, which is...  I think it's disgusting, first of all.  But also, it seems like a...  It seems like verbal rape to me.  And I think at some point...  Oh, shut up.  What is that?  She's such a dumb fucking...  Go eat more bugs, you stupid broad. 
[00:34:30]  Well, now we got to deal with something called verbal rape.  What is that?  We're making up more new stuff that we have to deal with?  That's when the guy from Usual Suspects Rape You.  This is verbal.  But this is their idea of an intelligent...  Verbal rape.  This is what's wrong with this.  This is their idea of a smart conservative woman.  Like, she's a...  Elizabeth Hasselbeck is a dummy.  She's a dummy, and she's a threat to nobody's point of view because of that.  Of course.  Like, she's a stupid bitch.  Of course.  She doesn't even know that she's playing that role. 
[00:35:00]  Can you imagine...  Whether people like or hate Ann Coulter, can you imagine her taking such a victim role?  Oh, God.  They would never...  Such a curled up in the corner, screaming help role?  Oh, yeah.  She gets all pissy and cries in that show.  Like, shows like The View would never...  Love her or hate her.  They would never put an Ann Coulter person on there to represent that side.  They don't want someone really strong that could handle herself in a room full of liberals.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  A little rape to me.  And I think at some point, there's got to be a point where Twitter should ban anyone who writes anything forever.  So then she should...  Oh, God!  Shut up!  How can you fucking get on a show and actually say you want Twitter to ban people for saying certain things?  What's the criteria?  Who fucking gets to judge what you...  You are so offended by the verbal raping that... 
[00:36:00]  Who the fuck determines?  She's a perpetual, pathetic victim.  This chick...  I hate these self-important people that think that their whole take on it is the be-all, end-all.  She bashed Chris Brown first.  Yeah.  And again, fine.  I don't mind her bashing Chris Brown.  Fuck him.  But he's got the right to bash her back.  Yeah, she went out of her way to bash him.  Who the fuck is she to not get...  And that's not her crying.  That's people crying for her.  No, I think...  Jenny, the little I know about her, we do DM every once in a while.  She fucking loves this shit. 
[00:36:30]  Pin her down and shove your tongue up her ass and tell her that's verbal rape.  Right there.  And just start reciting things.  I think she was...  She was bothered by the death threats, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's probably the first time she's ever gotten death threats.  Maybe that's scary a little bit.  Yeah, and the only thing Twitter should do anything about is people that are legitimately  making death threats, your account should be yanked.  If you're making legitimate threats to kill somebody...  Twitter has their rules.  Yeah.  They ban accounts all the time.  And as far as death threats, I mean, the fat, obese... 
[00:37:00]  Oh, yeah, it's terrible.  The obese black women that are supporting Team Breezy and fucking...  That, as I call him, woman-beat her.  I'm supporting Team Breezy on this clip.  Sorry.  They ain't gonna touch her.  Completely supporting Team Breezy on this one.  You can't do that.  Too busy eating.  How dumb is she?  Hasselback, she's one of yours, Ant.  She's one of yours.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't think so.  She's on...  Oh, Jesus.  I don't think so.  Oh, boy.  She wanted your boy, Romney. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Does this bother you?  For totally different reasons.  She's one of my boy, Romney.  Whew.  Anyone who writes anything forever...  So then she should be banned for going you're worth in this piece of bleep?  Yes.  Because here's the thing.  She should be banned.  We're out of court.  We shut up.  I wish I could do better fucking... 
[00:38:00]  My head stinks, bud.  You get the point.  Holy fuck.  The view chickens, they do it on Family Guy?  Ah.  I swear to God we didn't get this from the Family Guy.  Let me see that.  No, we've been doing that for a long time.  I think it's...  Yeah!  There's an egg on the chair.  Yeah, let me out of here.  I can't watch another second.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen to that.  This piece of bleep.  Because here's the thing.  Yes, she should be banned. 
[00:38:30]  He should be banned from Twitter and he should be banned.  And I think those sexual acts so explicitly...  I will say, he took everything...  He took everything down.  See, Whoopi's defending him.  Whoopi's defending him.  Right.  Which I kind of agree with her, but...  But that's just because of black men.  Of course it is.  That's just because he's black.  Of course.  If it was a white guy saying shit like that about a black woman, Whoopi would be all up  in his fucking gross.  Hold on.  We got a better example.  Uh-huh.  Nappy Head and Ho.  Yeah.  Fucking I misapologize.  She still was all in, man.  She didn't go out and say I misapologize.  Yeah, she didn't say, well, look, he took it back would be the equivalent of taking 
[00:39:00]  it down off Twitter, I guess, right?  He did everything possible.  Right.  And it wasn't good enough for Whoopi Goldberg.  So you're absolutely right.  Yeah.  He did take it down.  She should have said that.  Whoopi's a racial hypocrite, man.  Yeah.  She really is.  I hate to say it, but she is.  It really is.  And it annoys me because I like Whoopi Goldberg, but that's, come on, Whoopi, stop with that  shit.  Enough of her.  We get it.  You're black.  Hasselbeck.  Hasselbeck.  Hasselbeck.  I got some strong women in my life.  They fucking hate that broad. 
[00:39:30]  I am.  They fucking hate her.  Wow.  Yeah, she's fucking...  And these strong broads in my life, you got the Democrat, you got the Republican, and  they all hate her.  Yeah.  They think she's pretty fucking weak as far as a woman goes and her point of view.  Yeah, she's on the fucking view.  I hate that fucking show.  Ah, Tim Brazy. 
[00:40:00]  Tim Brazy.  I support him on this one.  He should be able to fucking slap back.  You don't know about Tim Braz.  Tim Braz is a wonderful man who's it.  Really?  I'd love for every one of those fat pigs to be on the receiving end of one of his punches.  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  What is with them?  I don't know.  Unbelievable.  Did we find the Ralphie May clips?  It's tough to move on with the show without getting some examples of what I was talking about. 
[00:40:30]  They're still looking.  We don't have many Ralphie May best of clips saved, so they're going through old shows  trying to find this.  E-Rock, what are you saying?  Enjoy the Ralphie May tweets later.  How about, uh...  Hold on.  Let me call it...  That's me. 
[00:41:00]  That's me.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  I just want to ask, and I want an honest answer.  Uh-huh.  Why don't we have too many Ralphie May best of clips?  Because it seems like we save everything.  That's a little strange.  Um...  I want an answer.  Well, one, he wasn't on that much.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  That happens.  Two, there wasn't really much to, uh...  To, uh...  From those shows.  Yeah, I think one of his appearances is completely stricken from the record. 
[00:41:30]  Uh, yeah.  Uh, the time, uh...  There was some fingering going on?  Oh.  And a couple of them were phone calls, so...  Can't really get the full effect off those.  I like Ralphie May.  I mean, I went with it when he really believed that he saved our careers.  It didn't...  We would have skated.  We would have been all right.  I mean, thanks.  But I went with it.  I'm like, yeah, what the hell?  You saved our show.  Yeah, yeah.  Now we'll be in greats. 
[00:42:00]  Huh?  Now we're in greats, and we're fucking being cunty with them.  I've heard from other people, though.  They started tweeting me about how, uh...  How...  One guy goes, I'm a nobody, and I said something critical about Ralphie, and for 12 hours...  I had to deal with him tweeting me about what I said.  I think Ralphie gets a little, you know, sensitive.  I think he's a little sensitive. 
[00:42:30]  You know.  It's a hard industry to be in and be that fucking sensitive.  I gotta be honest with you.  I mean, people are fucking brutal.  Thank you.  Oh, damn.  That's terrible.  I won't even read that.  I don't even know why we're talking about Ralphie May today.  That came out of nowhere.  Let's see.  Well, because he fucking tweeted...  What, it finally got to him that some stuff was said? 
[00:43:00]  He tweeted me before.  He had, huh?  About that.  Yeah, and I just kind of went, uh...  Look, I was just going off about it.  That doesn't...  It's neither here nor there.  Right.  I mean, what the fuck?  Well, the Elmo guy, there's a third, uh, underage kid coming forward.  Oh, dear.  How come they can accuse him anonymous?  I'm sick of the anonymous sexual accusations.  Like, if they can remain anonymous, then the charges shouldn't be made public.  Oh.  That drives me nuts.  Because even though this guy seems like a real piece of shit. 
[00:43:30]  But, you know, if you're going to accuse the guy publicly, and as they say, besmirch his name, as Colin would say, then their name should be used, too.  Like all of Sandusky's accusers.  I mean, until he's found guilty, his name shouldn't be made public, either.  Because you're attacking people like, well, with sexual crimes, there's such a stigma, and you're right.  But so there is on the person you're accusing.  Exactly.  And if he's guilty, then he should have the stigma attached to him.  Or make sure there's strong evidence.  You know what I mean? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  If there's strong evidence, then maybe protect the victim.  Especially in a situation like this, where you might want to look for some monetary compensation.  Yeah, yeah.  If there's real strong evidence, then I don't mind it as much to protect the name of a victim.  But if people could just willy-nilly say shit, and then this dopey press will just pick up on it because they're looking for their headlines, that certainly seems like it would be a problem, right?  So what goes on with this Elmo character, though?  Like, we all have this Kevin Clash guy.  He likes his young voice. 
[00:44:30]  But now the Elmo character is kind of put in jeopardy.  Has Elmo been seen anywhere?  And what do you do about the voice?  You've got to get somebody that can do that Elmo voice.  That voice seems like it's an easy one to do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you used to do it, even.  Yeah.  I think that's an easy one for somebody to just do.  I said Ant, which was very stupid on my part.  I go, I think they have to get rid of Elmo.  Oh, my God.  I think they've got a Sandusky situation slowly forming here. 
[00:45:00]  I'm thinking you get rid of Elmo.  It has to be the number one revenue driving force in the Sesame Street collection.  It has to be Elmo.  Everything Elmo sells like a motherfucker.  I think it's got more Elmo products out there than any of the other Muppet characters.  There's no fucking way.  Elmo could do.  You could have the guy doing the voice of Elmo, like, just raping hookers and slicing their throats,  and you're still going to fucking have Elmo.  And you're going to see Elmo shit at Toys R Us? 
[00:45:30]  Absolutely.  That's why it's all bullshit, because if it was a lesser-known character, they would do the right thing.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah, let's get rid of this character.  Oh, the Count has to go.  Or whatever, right.  But if it's your big seller, there's no fucking way I think you're right.  I think you're right.  Too much money.  They're not going to give up all that money.  No, no, that's a lot of fucking cash.  What are the guys in Times Square going to do? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, the El...  Oh, God.  They can walk around with boners.  Those creeps.  Big Elmo boners.  Those creeps, yeah.  They stink, too.  They arrest one a year, it seems like.  Yeah.  For groping.  If you go to Times Square, watch out for the Elmo guys.  Unless they've cleaned up the Elmo guys, they're very aggressive.  There's a bunch of stories online about them.  And it doesn't seem to be the same guy.  I'll tell you, the fucking Sesame Street people, Marvel Comics, and fucking Disney should walk  through...  Their lawyers should walk through Times Square handing out subpoenas. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  Because the fucking licensing shit that's going on in there.  Cinderella looks like she has a meth problem.  Yeah.  They're a little ragged.  You know, they try so hard to protect the image of these characters.  And when you have a small little fucking Hispanic man in a Mickey costume...  I don't think Sesame Street appreciates Elmo being handcuffed in the middle of Times Square.  Do you think the children's television workshop likes that?  As the guy's trying to hold on to the Elmo head... 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  ...as he's handcuffed.  You're right.  Yeah.  That was recent, too.  That was only last.  Yeah, I remember that one.  I think that's a different guy, because they arrested a black Elmo once.  That guy's white.  I'm telling you, I think they arrest one of these guys one a year.  Easy.  His hands off.  Look at his dumb head.  You think Sesame Street's like, oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Can we clear these people out?  Then you got the SpongeBob.  I've seen SpongeBob in Times Square.  Oh, yeah.  They're all there. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, I saw that naked cowboy guy walking through.  I forgot to tell you.  Oh, God.  He's the douchiest man alive.  Is he still able to pull it off?  Yeah.  He's been there for fucking years.  You know what?  Jesus Christ.  He doesn't have an ounce of fat on him.  I mean, obviously, the guy's got to work out.  Like, for 10 fucking years, this guy's been working out.  He was actually telling the ladies, all right, come.  Oh, get tall.  Yeah.  I want to pet you with the naked cowboy.  He's got his oyster business to fall back on.  No.  He's really douchey. 
[00:48:00]  He is.  He's laid a lot.  Well, he's married, though, right?  Yeah.  He's got the naked cowgirl is his chick.  He's not fucking built on Santa.  I bet he loves that he Googles naked cowboy and Sandy douchebag's picture comes up.  I just love how he spent all that time, like, cultivating that image, and then she just  swoops in, takes her tits out, and gets a guitar.  I'm a naked cowgirl, man.  He's fucking great, man.  She's getting that.  Yeah.  What a slob.  He's uncomfortable to fucking listen to. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  But the ladies just eat it up.  Good for him, I guess.  But they fucking can't wait to get their picture taken with him.  Look out, girls.  They're all like, tee-hee, tee-hee, look at what I'm doing, taking a picture with him.  He's naughty.  Oh, look out.  Look what I'm doing.  Oh, Jesus.  God, they're all over Facebook, those type of roads.  Oh, no.  Please.  He's been at this for a very long time.  Facebook is weird. 
[00:49:00]  I know a lot of people on Facebook.  I'm like, that's not you.  Yeah.  You are so misrepresenting yourself on a regular basis.  Who are you?  People feel they have to fill their Facebooks with something.  But we're all on to you.  We know who you are.  Will you stop making believe you're this persona?  Yeah.  Holy fuck, you're not a nice person.  You don't like your kids.  Why are you taking pictures with your kids?  Like you're the perfect family.  That's it. 
[00:49:30]  Those are the pictures they show after the big mass murder.  Wow.  What a weird thing.  I mean, you know, they've been talking for years that we're all going to live our lives online.  We'd rather...  Remember we did that discussion.  That's years ago now.  There was a whole bunch of people that would rather live their lives online in the gaming community.  Right.  This was before Facebook really took off.  Yeah, yeah.  Where they had shitty fucking jobs.  But man, online with some of these games, they were rock stars. 
[00:50:00]  Ah, kings.  What was that one game where...  Second Life.  Second Life.  Thank you, Dan.  We were playing Second Life.  What was our engineer over at CBS?  I can't remember his name.  Oh, fuck.  Tim.  Tim.  God, yeah.  Tim was the Second Life guy.  Second Life was installed on, like, every computer.  Yes.  Wow.  We'd catch him in the morning, yeah.  What was his character?  Didn't we discover his character on Second Life?  Wasn't that a chick?  I think it was a chick.  Yeah, it was a chick.  It was some hot chick.  Yeah, and he was, like, buying clothes for her and shit.  It was fucking creepy.  And he was kind of a dumpy guy.  He found a way to make money off that game. 
[00:50:30]  He was buying something in the game and then selling it to other people, like wholesale.  And that's all he would do all day was just ship virtual products.  All day, and then at night, I guess he'd play.  Oh, I didn't realize.  I didn't realize.  I honestly, I think it was shoes.  Oh, really?  But, you know, and now with Facebook, you could have your Facebook life, which is completely,  I mean, completely different than how you walk around the fucking world.  You really could make a completely bogus Facebook, and not like a fake one, but make it you, your 
[00:51:00]  name and everything, but represent yourself as being completely a different person.  That's what I'm trying to say here today.  Yeah.  You see it.  I guess you're not on Facebook as much.  Yeah.  People are already doing that.  It's the Matrix.  Yes, truly the Matrix.  Want to eat?  Yeah, let's eat some shit.  We found one clip, if you want it, before going.  Oh, well, of course we would.  I warn you, it's a little distorted.  Oh, is it? 
[00:51:30]  So, wait, wait, wait.  So, Ralphie Mays met at all of us, even though.  Right.  It's just me that said it.  Even though it's the leader on this one.  Yeah.  Look, we all take the lead on things, and then everyone else gets fucking blamed?  That's not.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  But I was saying, you know, when Ralphie's on the show, somebody had asked me.  I didn't just volunteer it, but neither here nor there.  Someone asked me why Ralphie hasn't been on the show, and I said, I don't know.  But then I brought up the fact that there were a couple of issues I had with Ralphie, one of which  is the fact that he's very loud on the show. 
[00:52:00]  It's distracting.  His laugh is loud and distracting.  And he kind of bowls over you when you're trying to talk and have a discussion.  It's very hard to have a discussion.  I don't think we have an example of that.  I hope.  I challenge you, Rock.  All right.  Oh, good, great.  That sounded like Patrice.  Patrice would do that.  That wasn't Patrice?  No.  Patrice would do that, but he'd back off the mic a lot more.  Boy, he did it. 
[00:52:30]  You were like, fuck.  That was fucking funny.  You knew you were doing all right.  It was funny.  Patrice gave you that laugh?  Yeah.  And he knew how to just completely go, all right, I'm out of control and move away.  Yeah.  He has walked out.  One of my favorite videos I ever filmed was when he actually left the studio because he  knew he was laughing so hard.  Fuck, I miss that motherfucker.  Year tomorrow, right?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Lost Patrice a year tomorrow.  And we're doing the Patrice O'Neal special this weekend?  Yeah, 21-hour special. 
[00:53:00]  Is it the one we did last year or did we pump it up a little bit with all the shit?  We did two last year.  One for the weekend and then one the day that we had to take off.  But we combined everything.  I'll throw in a couple extras that weren't in the special.  And this is going to run nonstop all weekend.  Nice.  Ooh.  Fuck.  Ooh.  All right.  When we get back, oh, did we do the Elmo thing?  Kind of.  Third accuser coming forward.  We'll see what he's about.  I want to talk about this slob that died because she couldn't fly back on Delta.  And her husband, of course, is suing for $6 million. 
[00:53:30]  This fucking fat monster.  She was literally a monster.  Oh, my God.  Enough already with fucking.  I know it's very tough.  Why take responsibility?  It drives me fucking crazy.  You know why?  Because I'm in the airport all the time and I have to eat.  You think I want to eat good?  No.  I hate eating good.  Well.  Fucking stinks.  And yeah, I hate eating well.  Well, I guess some people want to be able to shove whatever they want in their face. 
[00:54:00]  And then.  She was already a leg short.  She already had cut a leg off of her.  And she still weighed well over 400 pounds.  And you know what a leg weighs?  Legs are heavy.  It's got to be at least what?  Jesus.  I don't know.  But I'm sure a leg is pretty goddamn heavy.  You got a leg up on you, right?  What percentage of your body, you think?  Normal person.  You know, person meaning like you're not belly heavy. 
[00:54:30]  Let's see.  Like if you're in relatively okay shape, average person.  What percentage of the.  There you go.  Let's figure that one out.  We'll figure that one out.  20?  Yeah.  20%?  I'd guess.  Per leg?  Maybe 20.  So your legs take up 40% of your total.  Jimmy might be right.  Wow, that sounds pretty reasonable.  I might go slightly lower.  Right.  I'm going to go 35.  You already have the answer?  No.  I'm going to go 35.  35%.  My estimation is lining up with Jimmy's. 
[00:55:00]  40?  Yeah.  No, no.  I'll go, like Jimmy said, 20.  I mean.  20 per leg.  Now I'm talking about both legs.  Oh, both?  Yeah.  It's 40.  40 total.  I'm going 35.  I think it's slightly less.  I think it's a little less.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because your hands and your arms are light.  Now I've got to look it up.  My torso is light.  My torso is huge.  Yeah, the torso is heavy.  Torso is a lot.  Percentage.  19.5 per leg?  Is that true?  That's close.  Did you look at it?  I didn't look, but that sounds pretty close.  That's 39.  I was voted one most likely to guess the percentage accurately. 
[00:55:30]  That's 39.  Jimmy might have pretty much nailed it.  I don't know.  All right, we'll figure that out.  Also, Brad Pitt has a really douchey commercial we've got to play today.  That commercial's retarded.  And then we got the two and a half men.  Two and a half men.  This douchebag kid.  Two and a half men kid.  We'll explain.  And we have guests.  Oh, yeah.  We have Ray Liotta today.  Yes.  Ray Liotta and Steve-O. 
[00:56:00]  And Steve-O.  Yeah.  Steve-O.  I hope he's still clean.  I hope so, too.  I think he is.  Yeah, I think he is.  We'll have to ask him if it's working.  Time to eat.  Yes.  Oh, this is great.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got that shit right.  Got a kid update really fast. 
[00:56:30]  Just want to let the world know that my daughter has become a whale.  A what?  A whale.  Oh, oh.  You don't know kid shit, Ann.  I'm sorry.  No.  What happens is you bring a little nugget home and the thing just kind of has googly eyes  and just, you don't even know what the fuck they're staring at.  I think they can only see like a half an inch in front of their face or something.  Yeah.  Then a few weeks go by and all of a sudden, bing, they become a whale.  And they start looking around and you're like, what the fuck?  Oh, like they notice that they're actually like existing? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, they start smiling and looking around at everything.  But for the first few weeks, it's just like these dead eyes really just look like this.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  Kind of lifeless eyes.  They can't really focus on anything.  Oh, fucked up.  She's officially become aware.  Just kind of fun.  Makes it a little easier, I guess.  Jesus.  You want some Jamie Foxx?  You want some Brad Pitt?  You want the two and a half men guy?  Oh, that two and a half men guy.  That story's annoying.  He fucking lost his mind. 
[00:57:30]  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  I've never heard this.  You've never heard this?  No.  Men.  Oh, we did that whole bit too, right?  Don't they punch up their show and just out of nowhere go, men.  Yes.  Iraq would know.  Iraq, what do they do with that?  Yeah.  To segue in between scenes, it's just that end of the theme where they just go, men.  I saw the Miley Cyrus episode with this kid and he looked very uninterested in Miley Cyrus 
[00:58:00]  and she was looking all hot and shit.  Let me tell you something.  You don't fall this far into religion like this kid did without something horrific having  happened to you.  Fine.  Wow.  Look, I'm not even going to question if this is what he's into.  Here's the thing, idiot.  Quit the fucking show.  He wants to be fired.  Quit the fucking show if this is what you believe and give all the money back that you  made.  You got a real nice life because of this show.  Yeah.  Really nice.  Eight million a year.  What a douchebag.  So fucking give all the money back and do the Lord's work. 
[00:58:30]  He's trying to do that.  Take all the money you made and give it to a charity.  He's trying to do that.  Then I would respect you.  He's under contract for another year.  So quit it.  He says he doesn't want to be part of the problem.  The filth.  Part of the filth and evil.  He says that there are two sides.  There is God's side and the other side.  I fucking hate this kid.  I fucking hate him.  And he needs to be on God's side.  And he goes, there's no compromising.  You can't be kind of like, hey, I'm with God and I'm religious and stuff and do a show 
[00:59:00]  like he does to an F-man.  And so he's got to leave all that.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  Yeah.  350,000 episodes and he's crying.  What a little jerk off.  Did someone put it in his chubby little dumper when he was early on the show?  Someone tag his chubby little dumper?  I can't believe it's the same kid.  He has a nice fat little rump.  It's time to get a new fucking half in there anyway.  They're probably all being nice to him.  What's wrong?  You know, they're going to change the script. 
[00:59:30]  You're going to wreck the show.  How is it two and a half men when he's like a man now?  It's three men, the show.  Yeah.  The show's three men.  Time to get a new half.  I bet you they do.  I bet you they get a new half.  Oh, they will.  It's like they killed off Charlie Sheen.  They're trying to make a point that they could survive without Charlie Sheen and so far they've  done all right, man.  They could survive without this kid, too.  I think they even won some awards.  Yeah.  With Ashton Kutcher.  They'll get rid of this kid and pop some other kid.  But why is it, quit the show immediately. 
[01:00:00]  You're not that brave, I guess.  Because he's sitting there going, I guess we got the clips.  Why don't we just play it?  Yeah.  I think he's crazy enough to quit the show, but he probably can't because he's under contract  for another year.  Quit the show.  But he's saying he's encouraging people not to watch it.  Yes.  Why don't they just fire him?  He's obviously a jerk off.  Just fucking fire him.  Fuck him.  And they don't need him.  No one cares about him.  No, they need a small kid again.  They could drag some small kid in with some dumb storyline.  Oliver. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, do an Oliver.  What the hell?  This fucking asshole sabotaging his coworkers like that.  What a cocksucker this kid is.  To actually go on, and all these people that work on this show.  And you're going to publicly blast it while you're on it?  Don't fuck yourself.  Don't watch it.  Right.  Then fucking leave today.  They must know he's just a pain in the ass.  He must be really pain in the ass to work with, too, because he's talking about observing  the Sabbath and everything, so he can't work. 
[01:01:00]  Little fucking fat kid.  Goodbye.  He sounds like a really fun guy.  Under personal life facts, Jones is fond of collecting quirky socks and propeller hats.  Yeah, I think Jones has other issues.  Oh, man.  That he's hoping God will take out of his mouth, as it were.  Jake from Two and a Half Men means nothing.  He is a non-existent character.  He's...  Two and a Half Men.  If you watch Two and a Half Men, please stop watching Two and a Half Men. 
[01:01:30]  I'm on Two and a Half Men.  I don't want to be on it.  Please stop watching it.  Please stop filling your head with filth.  Please.  It's...  It's...  You know, people say it's just entertainment.  The fact that it's entertainment...  It's...  It's...  Do some research on...  You think he's got some family members that are crying somewhere?  I know.  This is some weird black church that he's involved in.  Oh, is it? 
[01:02:00]  Really?  Why a black church?  Seventh-day Adventist church?  Adventist, yeah.  He goes off in the beginning of that clip about how he...  He's trying to explain to this black preacher guy that's next to him.  That's a kid.  What?  Isn't it a kid he's next to?  No, he's next to some black dude.  Yeah, but...  I mean a kid.  It wasn't a kid.  I mean someone in his 20s.  Well, kind of, but he's the preacher guy.  Really?  Yeah.  One of them.  He just looked a little too young to be the preacher guy.  Yeah, he's one of the preacher guys.  All right.  What's he trying to explain? 
[01:02:30]  And he's explaining how...  He goes, I just...  I like being around black people.  And he's almost sounding apologetic.  Like, and I say black people because I was with a friend.  He said African-American, and I said African-American.  He said, no, I'm black, so I say black.  I hope that's okay.  Like, he's such an apologist, and it's just...  He's a weird motherfucker.  He seems like a little worm.  Like, here's his...  He seems like because he's been famous for a long time, so he has no sense of... 
[01:03:00]  He thinks he has a sense of who he is, but he's just trying to find this identity.  It's like, oh, sorry, baby boy, that you're making $350,000 a week and you didn't have time  for your teenage years.  Yeah, yeah, that sounds like part of it.  God, what a shithead.  Yeah.  I only hate him because he's attacking a show while he's on it.  If he left the show and then said, I don't want to re-sign, I would have no issue with  that.  Right.  But the fact that this little cunt is doing this while he's under contract makes me sick,  this selfish little douchebag.  You're still employed, man.  Why didn't you leave before?  You could have left.  Yeah, because the money's too good. 
[01:03:30]  So, what the fuck?  What is it going to be?  If you believe this, then you've got to leave immediately.  And probably you should give the money back.  Yeah.  Because you got dirty money.  You got money that you made because you were on a filthy show.  I don't think Jesus would appreciate that.  After watching that video clip, mark my fucking words, he will not have that money long.  These motherfuckers will fleece him of every penny.  You think the church is really excited and they got a big one?  They are creaming over the amount of cash this motherfucker is going to throw into this 
[01:04:00]  church.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  The effects of television in your brain.  And I promise you, you'll have a decision to make when it comes to the television.  And especially with what you watch on the television.  It's bad news.  It's bad news.  So, that's coming.  I don't know if it means any more coming from me.  But you might not have heard it otherwise. 
[01:04:30]  So, just watch out.  Watch out.  Because a lot of people don't like to think about how deceptive the enemy is.  That's right.  Ah, the enemy.  It's way more...  He's been doing this for a lot longer than any of us have been around.  That's right.  So, we can't play around.  There's no playing around when it comes to eternity.  If we're lukewarm, and if we're behaving like the Laodiceans, it's going to cause a lot 
[01:05:00]  more harm because people will see us and be like, oh, I can be a Christian and be on  a show like Two and a Half Men.  You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that.  Let me ask you, did they wrap for the season?  I don't know.  No.  They didn't, right?  No, they don't end until like March.  So...  God, is he embarrassing this kid?  How the fuck does he even like...  He's under contract.  I don't know. 
[01:05:30]  He probably looks at it as like, oh my God, the devil is keeping me in this and I have  to remain strong and speak out against it and take the money and fucking give it away.  If I was one of the writers for that show, I would just write some evil shit.  Yeah, I would write some evil shit.  Holy shit.  All right, look.  Make him gay, first of all.  Yeah.  So he's got to have gay love scenes.  Right.  Everything that is totally against the church.  Make him just have a red face with fucking devil horns. 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Have him throw like dots at God or something.  Then, he continues here.  A friend of mine at school had told me about, he said a friend of his, and this friend was  the friend that couldn't go out.  I'm saying friend.  We are saying.  And then things like that and we never knew why.  And he told me about a friend of his church that was, that I was looking to go to a church  with an all black congregation. 
[01:06:30]  Why?  You know, I was, I guess you could say I was looking for like a black gospel theme.  I don't know.  I was just, I like black people.  And I'm not afraid to say it.  And, um.  What does that mean?  You are afraid to say it if you say that.  Yeah.  Do you understand that?  First of all, he's trying so hard.  You are kind of afraid to say that.  He's trying so hard to be accepted.  Ugh.  I can't live high enough in the sky.  Away from everybody. 
[01:07:00]  I would make him an atheist.  Yeah, yeah.  Make him an, or make him a devil worshiper.  Right.  And he's got to have horrid sexual practices with men.  Men.  Men.  Men.  Sucking men.  Men.  Men.  Men.  Yeah.  Men.  Get in there.  All right, now, what you're going to do is you're a Satan worshiper.  Yeah.  And you're slicing the throats of young boys, cutting off their genitals and eating them.  Go.  Yeah, then you've got to look up at God and go, hey, why don't you buzz off? 
[01:07:30]  Um.  And, uh.  And, uh.  And, you know, I say black.  I say black because, like, I have a friend, a friend of mine, he was a Bible worker, and  he's black, and he says to me, I'm not African American.  Right.  I was not born in Africa.  I am black.  Right.  He says that to me, and so I, I, I'm now, I'm not afraid, I, I know.  Black people are, black people rock.  You're good.  Don't worry about that. 
[01:08:00]  Black people rock.  I just have to make sure, because, you know, I don't, I don't know.  Black people rock.  You know, I know some people take things personally.  Do they?  No offense.  Oh, I hate it.  Whatsoever.  To anyone.  How hateable are you?  Angus is good.  Angus is good.  You're good.  You're good, bro.  You're good.  You got a pass.  Yeah, okay, good.  You're good.  You're good.  Um.  Um.  So, I was looking to go, I was looking to go.  Nah, it just goes on and on.  He's lost. 
[01:08:30]  Boy, is he lost.  You think Kirk Cameron's excited today?  Oh.  Uh.  He's got a new best pal.  Look at how hot Miley Cyrus was in this episode, and the kid could care less, or couldn't care  less, however the fuck that shit works.  You know what I'm trying to say.  Like, the kiss is awkward.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Oh, boy.  Show's filthy.  I'll go back.  This was a huge episode this year, because they got Miley Cyrus to guest star, and there's  a whole bunch of clips of just this kid.  What's your guys? 
[01:09:00]  Hi, soldier.  Hello.  You must be Jake.  I'm sleeping in your room.  God bless America.  You are just so sweet.  I swear I could just eat you up, but you know, then I'd probably get a sugar rush.  Missy's still sleeping?  Nah, she's in the shower.  Oops.  I get another pass in, like, a month, so maybe we can see each other then.  I sort of have a boyfriend.  A boyfriend?  But I thought you...  Goodbye, Jake. 
[01:09:30]  Don't be a hero.  He basically was part of the filthiest episode.  Oh, goodness.  Oh, goodness.  Oh, Cyrus pretty much just has her tits hanging out the entire episode.  This dialogue stinks, by the way.  Oh, yeah, of course.  It stinks.  America is eating it up, though.  They're eating it up.  Awful.  I'd make them really evil or something.  So does anyone know about this show?  Because it seems like if he's an army guy, that he's not on the show a lot, that he's  coming and going.  That's probably what they did.  So maybe they're already on to his shit. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Does anyone know?  Is he on as much as he used to be?  Because he said, I'll be on leave, you know, I'll get another pass in a few months.  Yeah, they probably put him in that situation where it's like, oh, he's, yeah, he's away.  Right.  Get that nut off the set.  He's a downer.  Jesus.  I like black people.  I, oh, please.  My friends like black people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Black people rock. 
[01:10:30]  More than white people?  Really?  So you wanted to find a church that was specifically just black people so you could just go in  there and be like, look at me, how crazy liberal and, and nice I am to the black people.  If I were him, if I would have my, I'd write an episode where he's got to stand up and say,  hey, God sucks a bunch of peckers.  That's pretty good, Chip.  That didn't work.  What the fuck? 
[01:11:00]  What the fuck?  Okay.  We got some info.  There's none of us watch this dumb show.  So we need some, some knowledge.  And of course.  Uh-oh.  Why'd you just go to the phone?  Yeah.  Plunk down the phone.  What's the matter?  Take a call. 
[01:11:30]  Oh boy.  I mean, does your phone fuck up like this at home?  No.  Why can't we have phones that work on a regular basis?  I must say.  I thought it was checked out pre-show.  Could you answer it that way maybe?  Is there a button?  I mean, everything seems to be working, but I can't like click down.  Is everything in order?  So we probably have to reboot, right?  Is everything in order?  We can still take it though.  Yeah, pop that guy down.  I just don't have phone problems in my own, my house like this.  Johnny?  No, unfortunately not. 
[01:12:00]  Talk to me, Johnny.  Johnny?  Talk to me, Johnny.  They've played the commercial, by the way, for, um...  Was that Rambo?  It's the first one.  First Blood.  First Blood.  And they keep playing that part where it's like, uh...  That many men?  Well, you better bring a good supply of bloody bags.  The way he says it.  The way he says it's bloody bags.  Well, you better have a good supply of bloody bags.  All right, whatever.  Oh, am I working now?  Bloody bags. 
[01:12:30]  Fucking Danny for the win.  Oh, shit.  Johnny in Queens.  What's up?  Talk to me, Johnny.  What's up, Johnny?  Yeah, listen, I still watch this dumb show for some reason.  And this kid has hardly been on it all year.  Wow.  Whenever he's on, he's talking to Charlie Harper there.  You know, whatever his name is.  I don't know any of the characters' names.  Well, he talks to him through his computer.  Okay.  Everything's video chat.  Oh, that's handy.  Just to let you know, something's going on.  He's hardly on it all.  All right, so he made it very, uh... 
[01:13:00]  Made everyone aware before the public found out, which is today.  Right.  For us.  So they already know.  Oh, yeah.  So they're like, look, all right, you gotta fucking, you know, work with us a little bit here.  And we'll fucking phase you out.  Yeah, it seems that's what they're doing.  Yep, but he should give his money back, that fucking kid.  Yeah, I mean, you know, if he wants to think this way, whatever.  I'm not gonna fucking beat him up for that part of it, but...  I will, because this is so far crazy.  I hate him.  Quit the show immediately and give back the filthy money you made from a filthy show. 
[01:13:30]  And Ant, he likes black people, Ant.  I see.  Gotta go, boys.  I like black people.  No, I really do.  I really like black people.  Yeah.  I'm not scared to say that shit.  I make him...  I write an episode, right, where he gets to go up to heaven and cut a bunch of farts.  I'm not scared to say that shit. 
[01:14:00]  No, we're gonna make it a very special episode.  Gonna slow down the theme.  Yeah.  What do they change that to? 
[01:14:30]  That's fucking great.  Yeah, Kirk Cameron does suck.  Oh, he's another one that went crazy religion, right?  Yeah.  This guy went...  Like, if you just want to fucking, you know, get a little religion, but this guy went so  far into it, it can only spell that something horrible happened to him.  Well, there's a lot of people like that out there. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  What are you gonna do?  They don't affect everyone else's lives.  Yeah.  Fucking just move on.  Evil.  Is that show really evil?  I know it sucks.  It's evil.  I can tell you this much.  It sucks.  It's something I would never watch, but is it actually evil?  Is it actually...  Literally evil.  Is it really filthy?  Yes.  Terribly evil.  When the show comes up, I feel like it's like a different country reporting because I've  never seen the show, and I can't imagine people who watch it.  So I always feel like, oh, that's that show that's on in Germany or something. 
[01:15:30]  I gave up on that fluff shit years ago, and we're supposed to kind of like maybe watch  that stuff for our radio show.  I just can't do it.  All that fluffy TV?  No, thank you.  I have zero interest in it.  If my dad watches it and reruns and laughs, then that's not what I want to watch.  That's exactly what I shouldn't be watching.  He laughs at it?  Oh, I think he loves that show.  Really?  Yeah, I don't understand.  Oh, boy.  The writing's terrific.  It's all that middle of the country stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not doubted.  Three years ago today, Tiger Woods crashed the SUV. 
[01:16:00]  That was a quick three years.  Wow.  Enjoy your life.  That's a quick three, right?  Man, yeah.  Better bring a good supply of body bags.  Now I got to hear that clip.  Body bags.  Get Rambo trailer.  First blood, right?  Yeah.  First blood body bags line.  Yeah, there it is.  All right.  Turn the volume off.  This is so douchey. 
[01:16:30]  I have a possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo.  Oh, boy.  God damn, like Rambo.  I made him.  Oh, this is so bad.  Sam Trotman.  Colonel Samuel Trotman.  Oh, shit.  We're a little busy this morning, Colonel.  What can I do for you?  I've come to get my boy.  You're a boy.  I recruited him.  I trained him.  I commanded him in Vietnam for three years.  I say that makes him mind.  I don't know why the Pentagon would send a full-bird colonel down here to handle this. 
[01:17:00]  The army thought I might be able to help.  Well, I don't know in what way.  Rambo's a civilian now.  He's my problem.  I don't think you understand.  Oh, boy.  I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.  No.  I came here to rescue you from him.  Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel.  I will try to be extra careful.  I'm just amazed that he allowed any of your posse to live.  Oh, boy.  Is that right?  Is that right?  Strictly speaking, he's...  Brian Dennehy rules, though.  You're lucky to be breathing. 
[01:17:30]  That's just great.  Colonel, you came out here to find out why one of your machines blew a gasket.  You don't seem to want to accept the fact that you're dealing with an expert in guerrilla warfare.  But the man who's the best...  Oh, this is horrible.  ...with his bare hands.  Oh.  A man who's been trained to ignore pain.  Oh.  ...weather.  To live off the land.  Oh.  To eat things that would make a billy goat puke.  He rocks.  In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of enemy personnel. 
[01:18:00]  To kill.  Period.  Win by attrition.  Well, Rambo was the best.  Okay, Colonel.  Now you got us all scared to death.  What are you in the special forces?  Is that the evil thing I ought to do about your psycho out there?  Let him go.  Do what?  For now.  Diffuse the whole situation.  Diffuse him.  Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.  Then put out a nationwide APB.  In a couple of weeks, you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace working in a car wash. 
[01:18:30]  There'll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt.  I do my own work.  I don't figure the best way to do that is to close my eyes and then hope he gets picked up in Seattle.  I think it's coming.  If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed.  You know, we're just a small hick town sheriff's department, Colonel, but we're expected to do our duty just like our heroes in the special forces.  In special forces, we teach our people to stay alive in the line of duty.  No shit.  I never thought of that.  You want a war?  You can't win.  There comes body bags.  You're telling me that 200 men against your boy is a no-win situation for us? 
[01:19:00]  You send that money.  Don't forget one thing.  What?  A good supply of body bags.  A good supply of body bags.  A good supply of body bags.  Can I tell you what I hate in writing?  That was so uncomfortable.  Yeah.  When everyone's talking about the character the way the character would want to be spoken about.  Yes.  Nobody tangles with Norton.  Norton's the best.  Written by Norton.  How fucking embarrassing. 
[01:19:30]  Whenever they talk about you, the way you'd want to overhear people talking about you.  Like you're cool.  Yeah.  Rambo's the best.  He's out there.  No weather?  Nothing.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Like the postman.  Rain or sleet or snow.  Is there any Stallone's dialogue in this from that movie?  That was the least awful of those movies and they were all pretty fucking bad.  It is done.  First one was good for its time. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, I always hate it.  You didn't like it ever.  No.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  You just don't turn it off.  It wasn't my war.  You asked me.  I didn't ask you.  What?  And I did what I had to do to win.  But somebody wouldn't let us win.  Ah.  And I come back to the world.  And I see all those maggots at the airport.  Protesting me.  Spitting.  Calling me a baby killer and all kinds of vile crap. 
[01:20:30]  Who are they to protest me, huh?  Who are they?  Unless they've been me and been there.  And know what the hell they're yelling about.  It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo.  It's over the past now.  For you.  For me, civilian life is nothing.  In the field, we had a coat of honor.  You watch my back.  I watch yours.  Back here, there's nothing.  You're the last of an elite group.  Ah.  Oh, God.  I can fly a gunship.  I can drive a tank.  I was in charge of a million dollar equipment.  Back here, I can't even hold a job.  Fucking guards. 
[01:21:00]  You're the last of an elite group.  Yeah.  You're the best there ever was, Rambo.  Though they broke the mold with you.  There'll never be another one like you.  A good supply of body biongs.  No good dialogue had been sent.  Here's to swimming with bow-legged women, Rambo.  Lifeless dialogue.  Like a doll's dialogue.  He's selling it. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, God.  He's selling it.  He's doing okay, yeah.  I mean, it's not as bad of a scene as I was hoping it would be.  He's selling it all.  But it's still irritating.  It really is.  We've talked about that shit on our own show.  These guys coming back from Iraq, they were in charge of all sorts of crazy shit.  Now they're driving a minivan, getting stuck in rush hour traffic.  I can't even imagine how you deal with that.  Yeah.  You snap like Rambo did.  Like Rambo.  You take a town hostage.  You let him go.  Make a gap for him to slip out of. 
[01:22:00]  Unless you've got a good supply of body bags.  Yeah, like the hole in this story.  You let him slip out.  Someone close to us who's certainly in the shit.  He lost one of his guys that came home and couldn't handle it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It just sucks.  It's sad, actually.  It happens like after every war.  Just like...  And the same story.  You know, you would never expect this type of person, you know, this person to do something 
[01:22:30]  like that.  But he just...  It's cray.  He just couldn't adjust when he got back to the States.  Yeah.  Horrible.  I can't even imagine.  I can't even imagine.  If you're the shit over there doing all sorts of crazy stuff, you get out and then what?  I like it over here.  You don't have to worry about nothing.  What happens to those guys?  I don't know how you turn into a bunny.  Yeah.  Nobody fucks with you?  Nobody fucks with you? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  What did he say about dying?  He goes, you only got to worry about dying.  And that don't make no...  Is that...  Oh, no.  Tango and Cash.  No.  Since we're talking about Stallone's cinematic masterpieces.  Oh, God.  That was a bad one.  How gay was Tango and Cash?  You mean awesome.  They loved each other.  It's an awesome movie, though.  Nice.  Look out.  We're watching movie clubs now. 
[01:23:30]  I just wanted to get to that whole supermarket scene.  Oh.  And of course he...  I hate Stallone's glasses.  Oh, like he's got a little snub-nosed revolver.  I'm an asshole.  I'm thinking of the wrong...  I was thinking of Cobra the whole time.  Oh.  Cobra's a good one.  Shit.  Sorry.  He's taking his snub-nosed 38 and shooting...  I want some dialogue.  Find some Tango and Cash dialogue.  Between the two of them.  Between...  All right.  All right.  You want to just watch the trailer?  Maybe that might help.  No.  Just the banter back and forth. 
[01:24:00]  Hello, Tango.  Good point, Cash.  Yeah.  Wait.  What's going to happen?  If he doesn't move...  Oh, man.  Oh, the truck's not short and the two punks fly out the window on his feet.  Glad you could drop in.  Ah!  You like jewelry?  Oh, fuck you.  I prefer blondes.  Do the honors.  This time...  Now the cops pull up.  What the hell do you think you're doing? 
[01:24:30]  You're out of control, Tango and Cash.  Whichever one you are.  You don't play by the rules.  God damn it!  Yeah.  What do you think you're doing?  Hey, man?  Snappy remark.  This is our jurisdiction.  This snappy dialogue drives me fucking nuts in movies.  Here it comes.  Ray.  Hey, Captain.  What the hell's going on here?  We're getting the locals to this thing.  It blew out the window of this truck. 
[01:25:00]  I know.  We got two guys lying on the road.  This is the Federal Highway, and we're out of our jurisdiction.  What the hell's going on?  I heard a rumor about this truck.  What about this truck?  It's not a truck.  A gas truck.  No.  It's a major movie violation.  Did you check the first panel?  It's full of gas, sir.  We checked the whole truck, asshole.  There's nothing in it.  And you're out of your neighborhood, big city boy.  Oh, my God.  I want your badge.  I want your weapon.  I want your...  Why do they think that was a good take? 
[01:25:30]  He thinks he's Rambo.  Oh.  That's kind of funny.  Rambo is a pussy.  Oh.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  We shot the gas truck.  That's great.  Well, you know, it's snowing.  So how did...  Could you see that in court?  How did you acquire the evidence?  Oh, that he got shot the gas truck?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  You want to get high?  I'll be damned.  He referenced a douchey movie he had done. 
[01:26:00]  Yes.  And then he fired his weapon into what we thought was a gas tanker.  He's a heck of a cop.  Fucking awful.  What the hell's going on here?  The best is when he had dialogue with Kirk.  Oh, it's so...  Cash and tango.  Oh.  Dishonored, deprisoned.  What a shameful fall from glory.  And who are you?  Just think of me as somebody who...  Believe it or not. 
[01:26:30]  George Ticom.  Doesn't like you very much.  Surprise party's definitely out.  They have, like, witty banter.  Witty repartee.  That's the guy I'd follow to the set up.  Don't panic.  Tarty tango.  You're a pretty boy, aren't you?  I'm panicking.  And you'd like me to change you for you?  I wouldn't.  How about you?  Oh.  Maybe you first. 
[01:27:00]  Don't panic.  Oh, this is so bad.  Oh, this guy's terrible.  Is he supposed to be Australian or Cockney?  I don't want to tell you, that's him.  Right, boy.  You want to cut my throat?  Go ahead, huh?  You want to cut my fucking head off  and use it for a fucking basketball?  You can bowl the motherfucker for all I care.  Just go let him do it.  I don't want to get killed by this limey immigrant jerk-off.  I want to get killed by an American jerk-off.  You fucking wanker.  Put it away for now. 
[01:27:30]  This is just...  I can't even do this anymore.  This is terrible.  It's so bad.  I love how we're just watching a movie.  What are you doing?  Jack Palance.  That's who it is.  Jack Palance.  The dialogue is just so bad.  Oh, shit.  It's Conan.  What?  It's Conan.  We're going to get Fubar now.  What the hell's Fubar?  You'll see.  Oh, no.  Real badass cops.  Oh, no.  This is terrible.  You can stop this.  This is unwatchable. 
[01:28:00]  Fuck.  Must be you.  Is that his real jaw?  Huh?  Is that that guy's real jaw?  It looks like it.  It's amazing.  Like, it's fucking...  He's like a cartoon.  That's a fucked up jaw.  That's fucked up.  John in Jersey.  John?  Yes, sir.  Hey, go ahead.  Yeah, you guys got to find the scene where they're in a shower together and they're measuring  each other's pricks.  Oh, yeah.  That is a shower scene, as I recall.  Let's try to find that.  Tango and Cash in the shower. 
[01:28:30]  Thank you, sir.  That's one of those shitty clips of people recorded off of their television.  Oh, gay.  Tango and Cash.  Don't have a good copy of it?  Not immediately.  No, right.  Those movies, though, at the time, I guess they were like...  Well, I mean...  Like, everybody saw Tango and Cash in.  You didn't walk out of the theater going,  Oh, that fucking sucked.  You walked out going,  It was fucking cool. 
[01:29:00]  That was just the writing style, too.  I mean, no one's going to accept that type of writing nowadays, obviously.  But it was accepted back then.  Like, all the shit.  Now, if you wrote like that, it would be an absolute parody.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, it is.  And there were so many movies back then that had the same fucking shit.  Sure.  The pissed-off Captain and the rogue cop.  Lethal Weapon pulled it off.  Those movies pulled it off.  Yes!  I love you and Conan the Barbarian.  I can't get any more volume over here.  Me and my ass. 
[01:29:30]  We'll be in the neighborhood.  No!  You fucking pig!  It's all up for you!  I think you're going to be very popular here.  Funny, I don't see your thing, but either.  Why are they having a good time?  Like, they're marching into prison.  Right.  And they're making that witty banter with everything they do.  They could be, like, on the brink of being killed.  Like, ah, kill them!  Kill them!  Oh, well, looks like we're going to be killed.  But they're...  You got a funny line? 
[01:30:00]  But their idea of an out-of-control prison was to just throw papers around.  Right.  You see that?  Flaming little pieces of paper were being thrown around.  Who has fucking paper in their cell?  How about some shit and urine?  Right, it would be shit, urine, spit.  Ass-fucking.  And these two don't have a worry in the world, never.  Just two cool guys saying funny things back and forth.  No matter how bad they...  Oh, I think you passed it.  What happened?  There it is.  What is that?  It looks like...  But Stoll looks like he's bending over a little bit.  Yeah.  Row.  Row.  Row. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, my God.  That's terrible stuff.  When we get back, we're going to talk about Brad Pitt's wonderful commercial.  So, speaking of douchey, we'll continue down this road.  He's doing something very douchey.  And also, we got Jamie Foxx talking about Obama.  Oh, boy.  Your boy, Obama.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I said the boy thing.  Oh, Jesus.  I didn't mean it like that.  Jesus.  Racist.  People tend to get up in arms when you say boy.  Why can't you just say boy? 
[01:31:00]  I don't know.  It's racist.  You know, we got jingles still.  We got to find a jingle winner by Friday when Steven Singer comes in here.  From I Hate Steven Singer, he'll have the money, the cash, or the...  What is it?  A thousand bucks? 
[01:31:30]  Two thousand, something like that.  Two thousand?  I don't know.  Steven Singer's giving it to us.  Is it a gift card, or is it actual cold hard cash?  I think it's cash.  Nice.  He'll be in Friday.  But we'll play some of the finalists.  Maybe today.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Bentley.  You see the Brad Pitt commercial?  It's so stupid.  I mean, we've been looking at these dumb perfume commercials for years that make no sense.  It's just some celebrity standing there spouting off some nonsense. 
[01:32:00]  Well, this fits that mold.  It just makes you smell a little better, so no one smells your swamp ass or your fucking  armpits.  Is there nothing worse, though?  Stop making it fucking all over-the-top glamorous.  Just trying to cover up some stank.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than what?  Than using cologne to try to cover up stuff?  I mean, it always sneaks through, doesn't it?  Not really.  No?  No.  Some cologne.  Not really.  Cologne.  Cologne.  Do you wear cologne? 
[01:32:30]  No.  I like it.  Cologne.  Every once in a while.  To cover up some stank.  $2,000 from IHSteamSinger.com.  That's the price.  Is he coming in with his knickknacks on Friday?  I'm sure he'll have treats for a while, as he usually does.  I've been to his store, and it's terrific.  Don't get me wrong.  But he comes by with knickknacks for us.  Gold rose?  I didn't say gold roses.  We have some gold roses.  It's not gold rose season.  It's not gold rose season.  That's true.  That's Valentine's Day.  But he brings knickknacks. 
[01:33:00]  Argentium?  Silver argentium diamonds?  I'll bring some.  Some of his argentium?  Bring something for us.  It'll be nice, and we'll be appreciative.  Yeah.  Bring the good stuff this time.  I know you got it.  The real good stuff.  Oh.  Is that what we're getting?  Oh.  I don't know.  I figured I would just go see what he's hawking.  What's he hawking?  Uh, a silver sky blue diamond endless necklace.  Oh.  It's got that little infinity eight curly thing.  Mm-hmm.  And then there's the love necklace.  Super silver argentium. 
[01:33:30]  Are we on the website yet?  On the diamond studs.  Let's see.  Where do I find that?  I've heard over the years.  We're not.  We are.  Yeah, we're listed.  We're there?  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good.  It's good.  Good.  Good to hear.  Oh, let's play the Brad Pitt commercial.  That's right.  We're done with Steve Singer.  We'll see him on Friday, and we'll catch up with him then.  Yeah.  Maybe we can bring some teen girls in here on Friday for him.  Oh, remember that?  Oh, man.  That trick never works. 
[01:34:00]  I was looking at OA photos.  A lot of people joined OA photos on Twitter yesterday.  Yeah.  Wow, that big jump in the number.  And I just keep laughing at fucking, fucking, oh, what?  Iraq.  Iraq, yes.  It distracted me.  With Teen Week.  Yeah.  There's, the big thing is the girl with the really hairy asshole that's been distracting people.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, fuck.  I knew there was something I wanted to talk about today. 
[01:34:30]  Let's see that.  There's so many pictures that are really hot from Teen Week, and Jim Cook is there.  He doesn't even know what he's getting involved with.  Yeah, he had no clue.  And this was before we completely fucked him up.  Yeah.  The clues were all there for him.  He should have ran away from us way before he did.  And we're all going through the teen pictures yesterday, and there's one where a girl has  a hairy ass.  Really?  Horribly so.  Iraq, you know what I'm talking about, right? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, it looks like...  Everyone pointed it out yesterday.  I'm surprised you didn't read the tweets.  Oh, I'm enjoying myself.  Yeah, take your time.  We'll get there.  Look at these girls.  Jim wants to fast forward directly to the hairy ass.  Oh, man.  These girls are lezzin' out.  Actually, I think I see it on the thumbnail.  Oh, jeez.  If you could see it on the thumbnail.  No, there's one.  No, it's a side view.  And it's really long.  What?  Yes.  No way.  Iraq, it's a side view more.  There.  No, that might...  I'll know when I see it.  There's some nice vagis in these pictures. 
[01:35:30]  It's crazy.  This was your show?  I know, right?  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  This was on the air.  Oh, man.  This digital insertion is an asshole.  This is crazy.  Where are these girls now?  Dude.  Yeah, right?  How the fuck did we even get them down?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  Where's the side view?  If you see ass hair in a side view...  I'm telling you.  It's pretty wild.  I don't know why...  It's like seeing it hanging through a hammock.  Iraq, what picture is it? 
[01:36:00]  Because I can't...  I'm looking...  I can't find it.  We've pretty much gone through all of them twice.  Iraq, where is he?  A liar.  Is there another...  Hang on.  I'm looking.  Is there a part two to this day?  Yeah.  Oh, Iraq.  God.  It always ends in disappointment.  No.  No.  It was kind of a side view.  It was pretty amazing how long it was.  OA photos on Twitter, by the way.  That's where we are right now.  These were crazy days.  It's all our old pictures from when we were able to do whatever the hell we wanted.  That one looked pretty, like...  Dicey.  No, back another couple, I think. 
[01:36:30]  There.  That's not it?  That's Dicey, but I thought it was another one.  Dicey!  People noticed the stained rug.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The horribly stained rug.  They're picking up on a lot of things with these photos, besides the obvious.  Wow.  We did insertion?  How did we get away with this?  Dude, it was total insertion, and...  But the lawyers, you know...  Oh, fuck.  Oh, wow.  Is that it?  No. 
[01:37:00]  What was that?  That's a mouth.  I don't know what that is.  Where's the mouth in that picture?  I can't even tell what that is.  No, that's a lip and a tongue there, right?  Oh, I see it.  Yeah, because it's like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  These are some fun shows, man.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  There it is.  I found it.  Come on.  I found it.  That's a chick.  Wow.  Wow.  Can you zoom in on that?  Fuck.  Wee.  Let's get some...  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  That is what a friend is.  Is that possible? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Wowee.  That's the only response I was getting to OA photos yesterday was the hairy asshole.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Is that possible?  The girl doesn't look like she's hairy otherwise.  Dude, what the fuck?  And once again, they got to close all the curtains as we look at what we used to do on radio.  Just pictures of what we used to do.  So now we have to close up the studio.  And everyone used to come in when we were doing this shit.  Remember these girls would just walk around the hall naked?  Yeah.  And they would just ask secretaries and salesgirls, do you know where the bathroom is? 
[01:38:00]  Dude, how does that chick's ass get so hairy?  I don't know.  It's crazy.  Because it doesn't look like she's a hairy one to begin with, but...  That's great.  All right.  Whatever.  OA photos.  What's going up there next, E-Rock?  I've been looking for more nudity to put up there.  It seems like they like the nudity.  Yeah.  The best, right?  But there's some girl that was sucking on Stinky's feet for, I guess, for tickets.  Probably can't do that anymore. 
[01:38:30]  No, no.  Dice and Filthy Fran.  Oh, yeah.  Dice at the beach.  That was my first day on the show.  That was Jimmy's first day, yes.  Do you have those pictures up?  No, not yet.  They're going to be going up today.  That was the first time I was actually physically in the studio.  And by the way, spread the shit out, E-Rock.  Give them a little taste every day.  Don't fucking, you know, blow your wad.  Yeah, that was a team week.  Yeah.  Do a tweet every other day or so with these pictures.  Okay.  What's it called on Twitter?  OA photos.  I'm going to join. 
[01:39:00]  The account's been around for a while, and E-Rock let it just drop for a while.  Teen Voyeur Bus.  He's back.  Oh, go to the Teen Voyeur Bus.  You got them up?  No, that's coming up today, too.  All right.  I want to see that.  No, just do one a day.  Okay, one a day.  Yeah, and then let that one sit there for a couple days.  Let these fucking guys, you know.  Then today I'll put up Eddie from Big Brother for some reason.  Put up Flair Bus.  Why'd you do that?  I like how this coochie fireworks bitch is holding the garbage can lid like she's part of the 300. 
[01:39:30]  I didn't realize how ugly she was.  Yeah.  It wasn't about her hot.  No, it sounded great on the air, you guys.  I vividly remember that day.  That was a good one.  It went flying down the hallway.  That is a good one.  How did we get away with this?  We really had no one watching us, huh?  No one.  I know there was a guy named Jeremy or something that was kind of around, but I think we walked all over him, too.  That was 2,000.  I know.  It's fucking crazy to think how long ago that was. 
[01:40:00]  We fired a bottle rocket out of a girl's snatch.  It doesn't get better than that.  Way before the jackass people, by the way.  I've wasted my life.  I know, right?  I still remember the first fucking girl I fooled around with from Opie and Anthony.  It was in my car in the village, going to do the cellar, and I couldn't believe I was getting pussy from radio.  I couldn't believe this new world.  I was such a zilch on the road.  And occasionally I'd get some with dice. 
[01:40:30]  That was always good times.  But it was this girl who I'm still friends with, actually.  I still talk to her once in a while.  Right.  And that's probably around 2,000.  We were fooling around in my car, and I think she blew me in the car on McDougal Street.  Oh.  And that was my first.  Wow.  And then there was this really hot one who used to come around who no one, I don't know  if anybody banged her.  Psycho Mark might have banged her, or he might have known her.  And she stopped coming around when we came back to satellite. 
[01:41:00]  But she blew me in the bathroom at Rascals.  Look at his eyes getting nice and big and happy.  I think it's like, yeah.  I wanted her so bad for so long.  This is when we were kicked off the air.  Right.  And she actually came to a show, and she fucking sucked it in the fucking toilet.  Jesus.  I just love the specificness of the locations.  Like, you know, it's like Rascals.  Yeah.  Rascals do it in my car.  That was West Orange.  That's serial killer shit.  I get it, though.  I remember crazy shit like that, too.  Yeah.  The odd details.  That you remember. 
[01:41:30]  Now, someone's saying, start an Instagram account.  Do they allow nudity or not?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  They don't, right?  No.  What's the difference between...  Facebook bought Instagram, so it's Facebook rules.  Yeah, what's the difference between Instagram and Twitter?  This is fine.  Facebook doesn't rule.  What?  You know, also, I just want to say, due to Facebook's policy changes, I would like...  Holy fucking dumb motherfuckers.  What happened?  See, in Facebook, there's some rumor going around.  Yeah.  That you could post this fucking thing that's going around, and then they won't have access, 
[01:42:00]  and you'll retain copyright of your photos and whatever you put up on Facebook.  And it's all a scam.  It's fake.  It's a rumor thing that ran amok.  And I see fucking Voss put it up on his.  I'm just like, everyone that puts it up, I think less of everybody I see that put that  up.  What is it exactly?  Yeah, but can't you see Voss responding to a chain letter anyway?  Yes!  You're like, bringing it into the shop.  Yes!  Why are you surprised by that?  I think he falls for a good scam. 
[01:42:30]  I think Rich would fall for one.  It's something that I guess, because supposedly Facebook had some policy change where they  own everything you put up.  Pictures, copyrights, songs, anything.  And they reserve the right to use it to promote Facebook.  To use it to promote Facebook.  Everything.  And then if you post this on your Facebook, they can't.  All of a sudden, they don't have the right due to this, and they quote some fucking, like,  some case law that was there.  And it's all fake! 
[01:43:00]  It's stupid!  People are worried that the pictures they have of their dumb kids Facebooking on them  are going to be used without their fucking permission.  Right.  But, boy, if you post that thing that, by the way, if you just took two words from it  and put it into a search engine, rumor, fake, all that would come up.  But they just, like, sheep just cut and paste it.  But I don't want my stuff used.  I'm a celebrity!  Right.  That's right, Jimmy.  Right.  Hey, uh...  Do your Facebook policy changes. 
[01:43:30]  I guess he rock.  Oh, wait, photos, by the way, on Twitter.  Let's promote.  I'm putting up a teen voice as we speak.  You just didn't know the 2,000 fucking followers in a day.  Not even a day.  Do you have Gay Marco eating pussy?  Oh, chief.  Pictures of that?  We might.  Let me go through and see.  That was one of the most amazing fucking shows we've ever...  That was a good one.  Done.  Have we played the clip in a while?  Do you have the clip?  Let me see.  What happened to him?  You know. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, no.  The Ninja?  I don't know.  We lost touch with a lot of these people over the years.  I don't know.  We should have one of those shows where we...  Where Are They Now?  Where Are They Now?  The show could be pretty good.  Sometimes the chemistry is different, though, than it was.  Mark came on the one time, and he had a tough time.  There was a bunch of comedians in it, XM, and it just wasn't a comfortable mix because  he hadn't been on in a while.  Frenchie was the best case, though.  Oh, God.  Yeah, why don't you lick my sea? 
[01:44:30]  It worked on regular radio.  Yeah.  He failed miserably with the new format.  Oh, could not make the...  And it has nothing to do with him as a person.  No, couldn't make the transition.  Do we have Frenchie on satellite?  It was so bad.  I want you to suck my cock, you fucking bitch!  Yeah.  That's going to take a little longer to find, I think.  Why don't you suck it, you effing sea?  You stupid sea! 
[01:45:00]  Or maybe we just got better.  We realized it's some fucking French guy that was not amusing.  Kind of like those Tango and Cash fucking movies.  Yeah.  For the time.  For the time.  Who would he always yell at?  Now you look back, it's easy to say, oh, this was horrible.  Who would he always yell at, though, on the air?  Just listeners.  Besides Marion.  No, there was one nemesis he had.  Limo Anthony?  What happened?  I'm upset.  Why?  Because I Google Frenchie Opie Anthony, and I'm scrolling down, and I got to see Travis's 
[01:45:30]  dumb fucking dog.  Aww.  I hate that dog.  And it says, famous and adorable Dexter from the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, God.  Sounds like fucking Walking Dead Vampire.  That dog stinks.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yes, that's perfect.  That's how it sounds?  That's what his dog sounds like.  It's suffering.  Yes, it absolutely sucks. 
[01:46:00]  It's suffocating every waking moment of its life.  French Bulldogs are...  You think you have a tough time sleeping.  I know.  Imagine having that.  They're a vicious fucking crossbreed, aren't they?  And they just don't breathe.  It's awful.  The thing would...  I'd be sitting on the couch trying to watch TV, and behind me, I'd just get frightened.  I'd hear that sound that Danny was making.  I'm trying to get the real deal going on here.  That sounds like it. 
[01:46:30]  That's terrible.  Yeah.  It's...  You got it?  And that's just a sleep.  It's worse when it's awake.  It's ignoring.  Let me see it.  Does he have something in his mouth?  No.  Yeah, he props his mouth open so he can breathe.  Dogs are...  That's...  These dogs have to sleep with a bone in their mouth so they can fucking breathe.  It's like me with my mask.  Except I can't get used to it.  It's got a little doggy apnea. 
[01:47:00]  But it's not cool, because they wouldn't have a life if we didn't breed them.  Well, they'd be different dogs.  Yeah, they'd have snouts with...  With a proper nasal cavity.  But that particular soul would not be here.  Oh.  Well, they'd be another soul.  It would be instead of another dog.  Oh, right.  It's like all the loads that I jack off into tissues.  It's just like, oh...  What are all those people?  Yeah, they're all people.  What are all those people?  I hate thinking...  It's really bugged out.  Millions of people.  When you think about the odds of even being here, why would you ever bitch about life  ever?  One in a million shot. 
[01:47:30]  One in a billion.  I know we all do, but why would you bitch?  The odds that you're even here are fucking ridiculous.  Like, think about...  And don't say I would be here as something else.  I don't believe that.  But also the odds that you're here and that you're in the United States and that you're  in New York.  And you're white.  And you're white.  And you're...  Like, things could have gone so bad.  And you have a good gig.  Yeah, a good gig.  And we still will bitch.  Yeah.  Count your blessings.  This life will be fucking done like that.  Yeah, Ralphie.  Just shut up, then. 
[01:48:00]  Just quit your whining.  The odds that we're even fucking here.  Oh, you would be here either way.  I don't believe that.  Whatever.  No fucking way I don't believe that.  Craziness.  We could have easily been in a fucking tissue.  Yeah.  I was birthday sex.  All of us.  I did the math.  You did birthday sex?  Nice.  My dad's birthday is in March and now it came out in December.  Birthday sex.  Come on.  My daughter might be New Year's Eve sex.  She'll figure it out one day.  October 4th. 
[01:48:30]  Figure it out.  What do you think it went down?  Yeah, it's close.  That's close.  How did you manage to perfectly plan your kid's birthday on your return to radio anniversary?  Was it on purpose?  I just don't know.  I was trying, yeah.  I knew it would help in the contract negotiations.  No, I don't know.  I'm having another kid here.  You've got to sign us.  Right.  Yeah.  Help me out here, Hendry.  No, it's over 4th.  Hey, E-Rock, work on the gay Marco. 
[01:49:00]  We gave you too many things to work on.  I want to hear that first, okay?  Yeah.  Please?  He's still trying to find it.  I thought we had the clip available.  Where is it?  Where's Frantic Friend?  I have gay Marco.  You have Frenchie?  It's three minutes.  It's him eating pussy while you're playing NSYNC.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  Well, the bit was he wanted to go to NSYNC really bad.  Yes.  Believe it or not, there was a time that people wanted to see NSYNC and would do anything  to go see this dumb band. 
[01:49:30]  He was a big JT fan.  Was he?  Remember?  Yeah.  He loved Justin Timberlake.  Didn't he?  Did his radar go up?  Yeah.  He loved him.  Yeah.  So we said, well, Marco, if you eat pussy, we certainly could get you NSYNC tickets.  We were able to get whatever the fuck we wanted back then.  So should we play this clip?  Sure.  Yeah, let's play it.  Let's hear how it went down.  Look at this gay guy go.  He's doing push-ups or something.  Is he getting better as time goes on?  No, he's getting worse. 
[01:50:00]  He's getting worse.  Marco, say something.  Marco, how are you doing?  No, keep going.  You're almost there.  Say something.  Don't lose contact or we start over.  Say something.  Hum or do something.  All right.  You seem to have settled down.  Listen to him breathe.  30 seconds, Marco.  30 seconds.  The song's almost over.  JC. 
[01:50:30]  Think JC.  Marco, JC.  Is this the worst you've ever had?  I can't even explain this right now.  Five, four, three.  We just got a girl to go.  Yeah, all right.  I'll let a gay guy eat my pussy.  No problem.  Eat my pussy.  How the fuck do we get this shit done?  Remember when he was yelling,  What is it?  That's what I was hoping to play.  I know.  I think I might have some better.  When he starts screaming  because he's never seen a vagina before.  He supposedly never even really saw one up close  so when the girl took her panties off 
[01:51:00]  he fucking lost his mind.  He didn't know what it was.  A blindfold.  Because Marco's got to be able to get...  I'll tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  The knees apart thing is very difficult for a guy.  All right.  Because that really strains the neck.  Well, what do you want me to say?  Well, you've got to be able to...  Yeah, you've got to be able to...  Is this good?  To really...  Yeah, because he could get in there.  You could pop your head through.  Oh, my God.  Marco, you okay?  Bend over me.  Bend over me.  How about you?  No, but that doesn't work like that.  Put your legs in the air. 
[01:51:30]  Put your legs in the air.  He can't get to the goods.  Oh, look at Marco.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Okay, get the song ready.  Hold on.  Hold on.  They're holding hands.  He is now kneeling down right in front of her.  She is sitting on the famous couch.  And he's crying.  Marco?  Marco's crying.  Marco.  How much do you think?  Oh, God.  JC.  It's JC.  You might need him.  Oh, JC.  I know, I know, I know. 
[01:52:00]  Think of JC.  JC.  Now, wait a minute.  He can't get to that way.  He's got to go from that way.  Yeah, there you go.  That's perfect.  You don't understand?  I understand.  You know what?  No, no.  Look, look.  Look, you know what you could do?  Stay like that until everything's ready to happen.  And then let it ride, and he will do what he's got to do.  Could you pause for a second?  Oh, could you pause for a second?  Don't worry.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  I keep forgetting.  This is regular fucking radio.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm still trying to dance around what is being said, but we're talking about a gay 
[01:52:30]  guy licking a girl's pussy.  I think we're doing a pretty good job.  I think so.  And the funny thing is, if we went down the hall and said, hey, want a gay guy to eat some  pussy on our show, they would absolutely say no.  No.  And this is satellite.  There's so many different reasons that you can't do that.  I know.  Like, it's not just one.  It's like five.  Easy.  And we did it, and there was no problems with anybody.  No.  We rarely had a problem with any of this stuff. 
[01:53:00]  This is fucking...  NBC left us alone for the most part.  Just, when we continue listening to this, just remember, this is regular, FCC-regulated  afternoon drive radio.  New York City.  New York City.  Let her rip.  He will be coached.  He will be coached by the lovely Cassidy.  Now, Opie, the song's got to start, and then Marco will go to work.  Are you shaking, Marco?  How are you doing, Marco?  Um, just keeping it down right now.  You're okay, Marco. 
[01:53:30]  He's going to have a heart attack.  No, Marco, you're okay.  I don't know if he can do it.  It's not that bad, Marco.  Yeah, not that bad.  I just think I'm in another place right now.  Right, another place.  Yeah.  You're okay.  He's sweating.  He's sweating.  He's sweating like crazy.  Okay.  He will not look at her.  All right, if we can get the music started, maybe, and we will go.  We have a go.  All right.  Ready?  Three.  Let's light this candle.  What, what, what, what?  What do I do first?  Okay.  All right, Marco. 
[01:54:00]  Calm down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  What you do first, Marco, right when the song starts and the beautiful  gates of pleasure open up, you take the area right here, and you go sort of right,  right below the, yeah, yeah, she will point right to it.  My eyes open, though.  Okay, I'll show you real fast, and then you can close my eyes.  Okay.  All right, it's hilarious.  Okay, go.  Can I look at it first?  Yeah.  All right, give him a quick look. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, my God.  No, Marco, get up.  Don't wait.  They changed the picture on the video.  Go back.  Marco, come here.  That was good timing.  Come here.  Marco, he's confused.  He was like, no, Marco, come here.  Come here.  What was that?  No, Marco.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco.  Marco.  I swear it was like a scene on Alien.  He freaked out.  And for the people playing at home, we just saw the heart. 
[01:55:00]  Right, right.  If you're a heterosexual guy, you would have just went like, oh, my God.  Good God.  Oh, my God.  Marco.  Marco.  Marco, take a breath.  Now, let's get back into position.  Here, watch.  I'll hold your hand if you want.  Oh, she'll hold your hand.  I'll hold your hand.  As long as I know, Opie's behind me.  Opie, just say yes, yes, yes.  And drop.  Don't you get the course.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  All right, he is back, kneeling.  He was not looking, though. 
[01:55:30]  Now, right when the music starts, she will again, the gates will open.  And you will.  Wait, make him look at it again.  Oh, God, that ruins it, dude.  It's so funny, though.  Come on.  Mike, come and make him look at it.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Open.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Why does it stick out like this?  That's a woman.  Uncle's crying. 
[01:56:00]  Uncle, it's okay.  It's making me feel bad.  There's no crying.  They don't make her feel bad.  I'm sure it's beautiful, but it is beautiful.  It could have been over with already.  Right, see?  Okay, Opie, no more showing.  In sync.  JC, just think JC.  JC, JC.  Yes, JC.  JC.  JC.  Suck it up.  It's JC.  JC.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Okay?  Hold on, we've got to make sure everyone's okay before we start the song. 
[01:56:30]  You've got to last three minutes and 20 seconds, Marco.  Can I just give you a pointer real quick?  All right.  If you want, go stick a Tic Tac in your mouth right now and eat it while you're doing it.  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  That's a good one.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  That was part one.  That's fucking hilarious.  And, Iraq, let's go back to your tape.  So now he's in the middle of doing it, right?  You got it to that point?  Yeah.  We're almost done with him eating.  Yeah, that's fine.  Just pick it up where you left off. 
[01:57:00]  Five, four, three, two, one.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it.  Marco did it.  Marco, Marco, how does it feel?  Marco.  How does it feel?  I'm going to Insync.  Look at him crying on the floor.  He's crying on the floor with a little bib on in his Insync shirt.  We put a bib on him, I forgot.  A bib.  We put a bib on the guy.  We put fucking assholes. 
[01:57:30]  Regular radio, there you go.  Holy shit.  That's 2000, right?  No, that was before that.  Might even be before that.  And you knew everything that was going on.  I mean, no one doubted what was going on.  You know, we didn't say it.  But everyone knew.  And it was like, regular radio, it was fun.  It was just fun.  Didn't he do his own radio show for like, his little quote-unquote his own radio show,  for like 15 minutes?  Did he?  Marco?  Oh, on your...  No, it was part of the bit.  Yeah, yeah.  We were like, you go do a show. 
[01:58:00]  Go ahead.  And we left the studio.  Yeah, there was like sound effects and everything.  You guys remember?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's where that sound effect came from, where it was like, woo, that's the winner.  You have a picture of him?  I don't even know what he looks like.  I don't remember what he looks like anymore.  There's a photo of him and Jay Moore on OA Photos, if you want to...  Oh, yeah.  He loved Jay.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Jay stuck a riding crop in his asshole once.  He might have.  He did.  Like, we were sitting there and...  Jay drew a target on his ass once.  Yeah, he drew a target on his ass, and then he was whipping his ass to the riding crop, 
[01:58:30]  and then he just shoved it in Marco's asshole.  Did Marco like that?  Oh, yeah.  There was lots of penetration at that show, man.  A lot of penetration.  Holy shit.  We got bored.  Trying to put cell phones in girls.  But cell phones weren't small.  How were we thinking?  Remember when we tried to instruct Spaz what the tampon was, and he didn't know? 
[01:59:00]  You got the tampon clip.  That was a great one.  That's the famous scream.  That I don't know.  Let me see.  Oh, right.  That was the scream.  That's the famous scream of where that came from.  I think those photos are up there as well.  Ah, fucking funny shit.  A lot of the old shit on OA Photos.  Yeah.  Not the bits, but the photos from the bits, I guess.  Right?  The photos from the bits.  Photos from the bits.  The jewels from the belt.  I don't have the Spaz one in here. 
[01:59:30]  There we go.  It was when she bent over or something, and he just fucking screamed bloody murder.  You don't have it, huh?  That's Marco.  Yeah, that's Jay and Marco.  Look at Jay.  Holy shit.  I know, really, right?  Wow.  Looks like Elo.  Fuck.  Marco looks like Elo.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Look at us.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, man.  You guys managed to look better.  I don't know how he managed it.  That's pretty crazy.  That's up before he fucking pulled his pants down. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, because then he's trying to target on his ass.  Oh, and he's not fucking...  And he's doing an arrow into his asshole.  Hey, you remember that guy?  That's the male guy.  That's Eddie, the male guy.  Yeah.  Who was he with?  I think Jay's wrestling, Gay Marco.  No, that was me.  Oh, that's Corbett.  Wayne Corbett used to do our show a lot.  Right, right.  That's who it was.  Jay would bring him around.  Yeah, Jay fucking owned me wrestling.  I was like... 
[02:00:30]  On the floor.  Are these up on OA photos?  Yeah.  So go check it out for yourself.  Creepy Gay Marco in the back.  Yeah.  That's how he looked.  I swear to God, I don't remember what he looked like.  Creepy Gay Marco.  Jay Moore looking like a movie star.  Looking like a teenager.  I know, right?  Movie star qualities.  Dude, this shit was fucking forever ago.  And if you want, just one up, I put up Teen Voyeur Bus.  Well, let's go to it.  Oh, my God.  Dude, remember fucking, like, during commercial breaks, we would leave the studio, go into the 
[02:01:00]  giant fucking green area.  It wasn't even a green room.  It was like a whole area.  And smoke cigarettes, drink, and play foosball.  And fucking the Terminator pinball machine.  It just...  Everyone's in there fucking billowing smoke and drinking.  And no one...  No one cared.  No one bothered us.  It was fantastical.  We didn't see any of those idiots for fucking weeks at a time.  And these idiots have to wait for us every day outside the door. 
[02:01:30]  Remember, occasionally the boss would come in rolling his luggage, and then he would  just fucking go to his office and then roll his luggage out and leave it.  Look at little Jimmy.  Look at little Jimmy Norton.  With two asses right next to his face.  Nice t-shirt.  Like the show now.  That whack bag.  That's before the website.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  That's not the website.  That's just the expression.  I was just Dice saying it.  From Dice doing it.  That's where the website name came from.  Oh, man.  Who's that?  Forget it.  Oh, yeah.  You were going to mention the guy?  I could just make a ton of jokes. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Where's Eric in the picture, everybody?  Oh, there's E-Rock hiding.  That was out of the window of the voyeur bus looking.  Huge crowd.  Yep.  Huge fucking crowd.  We absolutely took over the city for one afternoon.  That's right outside Carnegie Hall.  Look, that's one block.  Remember, every block had people?  Is that Carlton, that motherfucker?  It better not be.  Oh, it is.  It better not be.  Look, it is.  Where?  Right there on the left?  Oh, God.  It's like Carlton right there.  Come on.  The only black guy in the crowd. 
[02:02:30]  Yep.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Okay.  I fucking...  I was in love with the one...  No, not that one.  Yeah, the one to the...  All the way on the right?  I like the Spanish one.  One over.  One over.  That one had the weird nipples.  I like those.  Jesus Christ.  I loved her big nipples.  Her big nipples.  Yeah.  She had weird ones.  Look at Jimmy.  That's Fox News on the bus.  So this is the famous...  Oh, man.  This is the famous arrest thing, huh? 
[02:03:00]  Jesus.  Look at that.  I was so eager and happy.  Oh, you were eager and happy, weren't you, Jimmy?  Until he got arrested.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All over that.  Every block.  I mean, this bus had, you know, obviously glass on the entire side of it and just nude  girls going down Broadway.  We got away with...  Yes.  We almost got away with it.  Fucking right down Broadway.  Every block, people were running.  Naked girls.  They were running after the bus.  Every block had a shitload of people taking pictures.  Wow.  Wowie, because that chick right there. 
[02:03:30]  You think we could do this again?  Right there.  The fucking dark-haired one.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe we were better.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  All right.  OA Photos has a lot of...  We have a guest.  A lot of pics from the old days.  Is he here?  Oh.  Who?  Ray Liotta's here.  Ray Liotta's here.  Let's take a break and get Ray Liotta in, man.  All right.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:04:00]  Got Ray Liotta walking down the hall.  Oh, yeah.  Toward the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Ray Liotta.  Hey, there he is.  Welcome back to the show, sir.  How you doing, man?  Hey, Ray.  Take a seat.  Promoting, of course, killing them softly.  Yeah, I've seen the trailers for this.  Looks great, man.  Looks like another one of these nice, what I like, action movies.  And a little, I don't know what's going on in that movie.  Looks very mysterious.  Yeah, it's good.  Very suspenseful. 
[02:04:30]  It's really good.  Yeah, yeah.  Was it Brad Pitt in that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins.  Yeah.  Jesus.  And, of course, it's a big name.  And it's about what?  Yeah, a big gun name.  Cool.  They're all coming after me.  I run a card game that I robbed years ago.  They decide that somebody, they want to rob the game again to think that it's me.  Everybody does think it's me.  And so Brad Pitt, who's an enforcer, calls in James Gandolfini to take me out. 
[02:05:00]  And then they find out the other guy.  So it's kind of like a heist, chase, but it's got some good humor in it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, they keep showing this clip of this scene where you're at a poker table laughing.  And I haven't heard, all I've done is seen silent images of you laughing at a poker table,  which is what?  Yeah, it's funny because I would play cards.  We shot it down in New Orleans, so I would go to Harrah's and play cards.  And I became friendly with a lot of the guys that play. 
[02:05:30]  Well, not a lot, but a few guys that played there.  And they were just professional poker players.  So I said, you know what?  So they're busting my chops after a while, acting.  What kind of job is that?  Right, poker player.  So I said, you guys wanted to, so we had to do the laugh scene.  I said, you know what?  It would be really good because sometimes just a laugh hysterically on cue is not the easiest thing to do sometimes.  So I got them.  So they came, and I figured, oh, we'll talk just like we laughed at the games.  And as soon as the camera came on in action, they froze. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  But ironically, it made me laugh more just to see them, you know, they're big talking all of a sudden just freeze.  Yeah, yeah, out of their element.  Yeah.  What were they supposed to do?  Was it supposed to be an improv dialogue or just kind of a casual hang thing?  Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's voiced over there, but, you know, I admit that I robbed the game, and it cracks me up, I guess.  And I was hoping for them to give me something back, so it would just be one big laugh. 
[02:06:30]  And, gee, if you look at it, when you see it, it's just me by myself laughing.  And they're not cracking a smile, nothing.  They're all panicking that they're going to do the wrong thing.  Yeah, yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  Are you any good at cards?  No.  You haven't gotten better?  Nah, I just don't like losing money.  So those guys, you've got to be really free with it.  And then a lot of those guys, like a lot of math guys, do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Counting cards and all.  Yeah, the odds.  Yeah, they know about odds in pot. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, if there's a certain amount in the pot, then.  Yeah, yeah, then it's worth your while to bet.  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  I don't know.  What do I got?  A pair?  What do I got?  That's all I know.  What do I got?  Although I do like watching it on ESPN.  Yeah, yeah.  I do like watching those guys.  And you wouldn't think that would be entertaining to actually watch.  But years ago, when it really started getting popular, a lot of people started watching it.  It is.  You know, like...  Yeah, the tough thing is a lot of times they don't show the whole cards to the camera.  So then it's not intriguing at all.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  But to see them bluffing and doing their thing.  Yeah, when you know what they have.  That's got to annoy the other guy, though, when they finally do air it.  And it's like, God damn, he got me on that one.  You know, he had nothing.  I have no ability to enjoy doing it.  But I've told this story before, but I went to a casino once and I put 20 on one of those...  Or I put a dollar on a wheel.  You know those wheels you spin at the sucker bet?  Like, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck.  And it actually hit 20.  And my first thought, instead of, hey, I won 20 bucks, fuck, why didn't I bet 20?  I would have won 400.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Immediately, it's never going to be good enough.  I understood the addiction in that moment. 
[02:08:00]  Like, I'll never be able to do this and enjoy it.  It's never that you're winning a dollar.  You're losing as much as you.  I thought it was not enjoyable at all for me.  It's fun.  It kills time.  And it's unbelievable how long you could sit at a table.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's just hours and hours and hours.  And all you're thinking about is that.  So that's a good thing.  Yeah.  I like playing.  I like blackjack when I go down.  I was just down in Atlantic City playing blackjack for, like, hours on end.  Just sit there.  Ask him how much he bets there.  Well, it did get a little crazy sometimes. 
[02:08:30]  I bet, like, six grand on three bets each.  18 Gs.  So it's like 18 on one hand.  Get out of here.  It's crazy.  You were doing that?  Yeah, it's crazy.  It's called being an addict, right?  I know it doesn't look it, but, yeah, he was doing it.  They do make money, right?  Believe me, it was out of hand.  It was out of hand.  But it was fun.  It was a big game in L.A.  I know some guys that play, and it's â€“ you could lose, like, 90 â€“ yeah, so how did you guys do? 
[02:09:00]  So-and-so lost 90,000.  It's crazy.  That's a lot of money.  That's a lot.  Dice â€“ Jimmy used to tour with Andrew Dice Clay.  He helped me once.  Really?  Yeah.  I was down.  I was in Atlantic City, and I know him.  We did a show together.  I think it was St. Ailes â€“ I don't remember what it was.  Mike Hammer or something.  And he came over to say hi.  He said, how are you doing here?  I says, nah, not too good.  He says, you want me to get it back for you?  Yeah.  But he checked â€“ he was with some guy, and he kind of, like, asked the guy if it was okay. 
[02:09:30]  So I guess he used to play a lot.  And sure enough, he got me back in maybe five hands.  Wow.  It was ball.  That is ball.  Really impressive.  Wow.  What did he do differently, though?  Huh?  What did he do differently?  He just got lucky.  Dice gambled.  He just got lucky.  He gambled.  This story could have been â€“  Hey, I'm going to look like a big shot.  In front of Ray, this is going to be great.  And he did it.  The story could have just been easily, fuck Dice, he cost me $200,000.  That's true. 
[02:10:00]  Exactly.  It could have easily â€“ yeah, it could have been.  I watched him.  The first time we did the Venetian, I watched Dice.  Before he actually did the Venetian, it had just opened, and he went in, and he probably  dropped $200,000.  No.  I was out of my mind.  I never saw cash like that.  He used to carry this fanny pack, and he would have these two guys with cash.  But he got a two-year contract out of it.  It was a smart move.  Oh, really?  Because they saw this guy's a high roller.  So let's hire him, and he'll just â€“ which he was a lot smarter than they thought he was.  But that was a smart â€“ that was an investment, I think, towards getting a Venetian contract. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  That's crazy.  You're smart not to do that, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so tempting when you have money just to fuck around and do stupid stuff, but it's  smart that you're concerned about losing.  No, my biggest thing â€“ my biggest buys are sneakers and sunglasses.  That's it.  Is that it?  I'm not a big â€“ I don't have lots of toys.  I like a nice car, but living in L.A., it certainly helps.  How many sneakers do you have?  Oh, a lot.  Yeah?  A lot.  And they're all the same thing.  I go shopping with my daughter, and I start going over towards the sneakers, and I start  reaching for some shoes.  Dad, don't. 
[02:11:00]  Is she just like, oh, please?  They're all black with white soles.  I must have, like, 20 of the same shoe.  Do you wear them?  Some of these guys â€“  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, some of these guys buy the sneakers and never wear them.  Yeah, no.  Well, I'm sure there's some that haven't seen light yet.  No, this guy right here, he buys them and doesn't â€“ I don't get that whole sneaker  culture at all.  Oh, yeah, please.  Yeah.  That is kind of odd.  You know what?  You do need your little outlet.  That's â€“ you know, some people are gambling.  The toys, like you were saying. 
[02:11:30]  Sneakers, I guess, is â€“  Is it hard for you to find shoes that fit so you keep buying the same thing?  No, I don't even try mine anymore.  Just give me the 10s.  That's it.  Wow.  Just walk out.  It's like almost OCD.  It's a little OCD.  It is a little OCD.  You kind of collect â€“ there's a lot â€“ you're not a hoarder, but it's like I collect weird  shit and sometimes you get caught in this weird loop where you're like, I got to have  them with that.  What do you collect?  I'll just collect like photos.  I get photos with people and it's fun that we have one, believe me.  It's to his left right there. 
[02:12:00]  No, that's Betty White.  Oh, no, he's waiting with Betty White.  Oh, that's the Betty White photo.  I'm going to get that sign later.  But it's just this weird â€“ it was baseball cards and it was kiss stuff at one point when  I was a kid.  I used to collect kiss stuff or just weird stuff you get caught in this loop of having  to have the collection.  But celebrity photos is your big one, man.  That's the most fun, yeah.  That's the most fun.  Yeah.  Not for the celebrity.  It's also more of the memories too, though.  Yes.  And sometimes I'll get a good story out of it.  Sometimes I won't.  Sometimes if something weird happens, you can tell it on stage and if not, then it's  still just nice.  You got one with Ray?  No, we just met at the Montreal Comedy Festival years ago.  Oh, you got a picture with him? 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  And he was very nice.  I was hoping that you did and that we could talk Ray.  And he blew me off?  Not taking a picture with you today.  I have a horrible story.  That would make us very happy after you leave.  No, I got everyone from Goodfellas except De Niro.  Oh, really?  De Niro's the tough one.  Yeah, he's not easy.  He's a nice guy, but I asked him for a photo once.  He goes, no, no, no, not right now because everybody will ask.  And I was like, no, I guess they will.  You're holding a grudge?  He just got in touch with me through somebody.  This guy, I guess, was opening a restaurant or something and he had a Goodfellas poster. 
[02:13:00]  And it's one of the few, I don't think, maybe there's one or two where it's all our names  on it.  Wow.  Joe, because I know their signatures now and that's it.  That's it.  Yeah, there's a lot of people.  That's a hard to get item.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So he called you and wanted you to sign it?  Yeah.  Did you say no?  No.  I feel like I'm busy, Bobby.  Please.  Have you worked with Gandolfini before?  No.  I don't know?  No.  Is he intense? 
[02:13:30]  I didn't have any scenes with him.  Oh, shit, really?  I mean, yeah.  I figured he was after you.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  He's a really good actor.  Yeah.  No, we didn't have any.  I didn't have any scenes with Brad.  Wow.  That's so odd.  All these guys that beat me up.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, because we haven't seen Gandolfini in much of anything.  Except the documentary he did for the soldiers.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was pretty cool.  That's really something.  Yeah.  And everybody's different when they act, but it's amazing when you see a guy that known  for a role and then you hear him talking. 
[02:14:00]  He's just like this soft-spoken, concerned guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really weird to hear him just in regular speak.  With his filmmaker beard.  Yeah.  He had his filmmaker beard on.  Like a real nice guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, when you auditioned for Goodfellas, did they offer it to you because you had done  Field of Dreams or did you actually have to go in and cold read it or did they say,  all right, we'll just screen test you?  What was your...  No, there's no reading.  I had to read for this movie, but I didn't have to read Goodfellas.  You did have to read Goodfellas or no?  Yeah, he wanted me to...  A lot of the younger directors now, he's not that young, but they like to see... 
[02:14:30]  I mean, it doesn't happen a lot, but I don't mind doing it.  I wanted the part, so...  And I don't care about auditioning.  Sometimes it's fun, actually.  So...  How much do you shit when Ray Liotta walks in?  When you're an actor just trying to go for a role and you're like, I think I got it,  and you see him walking in with the same script, you're like, oh, fuck.  How awful.  Oh, that must be terrible.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  No, but I mean, I think that's amazing that you're willing to do that.  And Sally Field, they said, really pushed to get Lincoln. 
[02:15:00]  And you think that, like...  She's the Oscar winner.  Yeah, yeah, you would think.  And she had to lobby to get that part.  Was this one you wanted?  She was great in that.  Amazing.  She was amazing.  She was really, really good.  Because you never think of Mary Todd Lincoln as anything other than just Abe's wife.  You never think, like, there was a real personality behind it.  And she played, like, this fucking crazy wife.  Just think that, you know, batshit crazy wife of Lincoln.  Yeah, that's pretty much what you think.  He was good, too.  I mean, that's...  I'm breaking no ground saying Dan Day-Lewis did a good job acting. 
[02:15:30]  You enjoyed it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When you watch movies like that, do you ever get, like, an uncomfortable...  Is it, like, it's hard for me to watch comedians doing something great?  Because I'm like, ugh.  Do you ever feel like that when you're watching a film?  Like, fuck, I should be in that movie.  Sometimes.  Sometimes you wish that you had that opportunity.  But, you know, everything works out the way it's supposed to work out.  I don't know, yeah.  The...  Are you playing a film called The Iceman?  Yeah.  You're playing...  Yeah.  With Michael Shannon.  Roy DeMeo? 
[02:16:00]  Uh-huh.  He was a mob guy.  Yeah.  That's...  This is a true story.  It's about this guy...  Kuklinski, right?  Richard Kuklinski.  Did you ever see the HBO documentary?  Yeah, of course.  It's riveting.  Crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  He was like that.  Michael Shannon's great in it.  Yeah.  He's really, really good in it.  I literally watched that two nights ago for no reason at all.  Kuklinski?  I got into a weird loop on YouTube, and I thought of Kuklinski, and I watched the first.  There was two of them, and I watched the first one where they're interviewing also the  cop who was undercover, who it turned out Kuklinski was planning on killing, so he was 
[02:16:30]  telling him everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he thought he was a hitman.  Oh, he was going to kill him.  Is that who you play in it?  No, no, no.  I play Roy DeMeo.  Oh, you said it.  Roy DeMeo is Keith, the cop's uncle, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Who?  What?  A buddy of mine, my security guy and my assistant, was a just-retired lieutenant off the NYPD,  and that's his uncle.  Jesus.  Really?  Yeah.  He was a legendary guy.  Oh, he's got a lot of...  He says, if Ray comes in to promote that next time, he's got a lot of memorabilia he  could bring in. 
[02:17:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  That's an intense story, what he did.  Yeah, yeah.  I've heard...  Chopping of the bodies.  Yeah, I heard a lot of the story from Keith, and it's, holy shit.  Did DeMeo do that?  Did he do, or was it just Kuklinski?  Well, Roy was just as intense.  Yeah.  He just would hire out certain things if he felt like he couldn't get close to somebody.  You know, at that time, a lot of people didn't know who Kuklinski was, and he was pretty  much a gun for hire.  Oh, okay.  He had a method for getting rid of his bodies cleanly. 
[02:17:30]  Wasn't there like a two-man tag team when he was trying to off people?  I think one guy would shoot him while the other stabbed to get rid of the pressure so  there wasn't this big spurting blood everywhere.  Really?  So, yeah.  Oh, really?  So they could kill and clean up really easily.  Well, what they said that the male did, he, behind, he had a large Gemini lounge, there  was an apartment, and he would take the people, they would either whack them in the apartment  or someplace else, they would put them over a bathtub, drain all the blood, and then just  chop, chop, yeah, cut them up.  How the hell do you do that? 
[02:18:00]  Like, how as a human being can anyone do that?  Do you hum?  What are you thinking when you're chopping through somebody's shoulder?  Food.  I heard, like, they'd be talking about eating or just eating during it.  Chop them up.  Not here, you stupid motherfucker.  Poor Maury.  There's Brad Pitt.  They just showed him doing his perfume commercial. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, that's all over the news.  They're kind of beating him up for the cologne commercial.  Brad Pitt's doing that.  I was asked that a lot.  We had a junket yesterday, and a lot of people are asking about it.  Yeah.  It's some big news thing, I guess, because he comes off looking a little weird in the spot,  but it's a perfume commercial.  That's what they do with those.  I'm sure it went to charity.  I would think.  Yeah, yeah.  I just wonder how much he got.  That's a good payday.  Level, yeah.  Do you want to do that when you're doing a film, too?  Does it bother you if you know a guy like Brad Pitt is getting more money, or do you never 
[02:19:00]  care, or do you want to sell it and go, like, ugh?  Well, sometimes, yeah.  It's not a meritocracy, this business.  It's pretty much how your movies do, and all well and good, because sometimes, like,  independent movies, you know, I'll take my chunk, and you try to say, no, I'll really  pay these people.  It's ridiculous, but that's just part of it.  Oh, on an independent movie, because the budgets are low, they'll give you more, of course,  because they're getting a name actor.  Yeah, but not much.  Right.  They got angry at me. 
[02:19:30]  Not much, fuckhead.  You can't buy a lot of sneakers with that.  What is going on with this?  Which one?  Oh, the Two and a Half Men thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, the kid in it, who's, like, 19 now.  Jehovah Witness, right?  No, he went, like, evangelical or something.  Yeah, one of these real hardcore church groups that he found himself in, and now he's bad-mouthing  the show, doesn't want to be honest, says it's evil.  It's filth.  Filth.  Yeah, filth.  I don't know.  I always think if someone goes to, you know, whatever you want to do religiously and stuff, 
[02:20:00]  I'm fine and dandy, but I always think if you dive a little too deep into religion,  you're definitely trying to run from something, you know?  Yeah, but isn't he?  I heard that he had a substance problem, and then they turned to that.  Was that early on?  I think that's what someone was telling me before.  That's what I was wondering if you guys.  Might have been.  Oh, we don't know about that.  I actually didn't know that.  We don't know about that detail.  We heard the clip of him talking to some preacher, and he was saying, if you watch this  show, please don't watch it.  I'm on it, and I don't want you to watch it.  Like, he's really a shithead.  He's sabotaging all these people that he works with. 
[02:20:30]  That is kind of crazy.  Yeah.  You imagine doing a film with somebody, and all of a sudden, they're bad-mouthing the  movie the day it comes out.  You're like, what are you doing?  Just wait until it's on DVD.  Now, sure, he's making bank.  Yeah, he's making $8 million a year.  $350,000 an episode.  That he's willing to give up.  That he's willing, I guess, willing to give up.  It's easy in the last year of a contract to say that, though, when you know you're going  to finish your...  That church has to be drooling, though.  Like, they're going to just release him of that money.  Like, yeah, come on to our church.  This is great.  How much do you like God? 
[02:21:00]  Wow.  I love the Ray laugh.  I love it.  He sounds like my laugh a little.  Yeah?  Oh.  That's a compliment.  Look at that.  You did some soap acting.  I was watching you last night on...  What was it?  Was it another world that you were on?  Yeah.  And that's an intense...  When did you hear you were watching it last night?  I was on YouTube.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  It shifts everywhere, right?  I'm a little behind, right?  Yes, I hear Luke and Laura getting married.  So, I'm talking. 
[02:21:30]  But, yeah, no, I was...  Yeah, I did a soap opera here in New York.  And how long did you do that for?  Three and a half years.  Wow.  You were great.  I got it right out of college.  You were really good, but I'm like, that's a hard way to make a living, doing a soap.  Yeah, I didn't want to do it at all.  You know, you come out, and you just want to be making movies, and, you know, my dad  coming through the Depression and everything, he said, you know, it's money, it's a start,  and all I did at that time was just theater, so...  You weren't kind of psyched, like, ah, I got a TV gig, you know, at least. 
[02:22:00]  No?  With the soap opera?  Yeah.  Not really.  Not really.  No, but it turned out to be great, because it really was, there were great people.  The producer would go to watch plays on Broadway, and he would go backstage if there was a part  that he was looking for, and he would usually get somebody, and that guaranteed that they  were going to be out for their shows, so there were really, really good actors.  This woman, Kathleen Whittles, played my mother, and she was great.  So what play were you in?  Oh, sorry, what play were you in when he saw you?  I wasn't in a play then. 
[02:22:30]  I had just, I was six months out of college.  The only play that I was, I was, I would bartend at the Schubert Organization, you know,  intermissions before the show.  Huh.  And that's what I was doing.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it was interesting to watch him do soap acting.  It was over you and this girl, Kit, her name was, or something?  Yeah, Kit.  She was the richest woman in America.  Oh, that was it?  I love this story.  So, so, I go up to, I'm in love with Eileen, and Eileen dies, I go to her, I give her a 
[02:23:00]  sing, Christopher's medal, here, Eileen, I love you.  Uh, she died, so I go up to where I proposed to her, and I slip on the ice, and, and I'm  out cold.  So, uh, in the hospital, there's this nurse, Kit, and, uh, who I ended up marrying, but  then I found out she was the richest woman in America, and because she didn't tell, tell  me, I got an annulment.  Oh, as most guys would.  You hate to find out they have money.  What you're saying is to make sure that we realize.  Holy shit.  That's crazy. 
[02:23:30]  This is exactly what we want to do.  Oh, gosh.  That is...  Do you have second thoughts?  No.  But what?  This is fantastic.  Yeah.  Don't give me nothing, Kit.  The one thing that the father said was that we should discuss every doubt, every question  that we have.  So we have to lay it all on the table, everything before we get married.  Kit, we don't need that money.  Kit.  I'm a nurse.  No, it was really good, because he slides down on the seat, and I was watching you, and 
[02:24:00]  I was like, there's a great moment where you're just telling me, because we love each other,  and that's important.  And I'm like, what a great actor.  Like, it was such a...  I would have wrecked that moment so immediately.  Of course you would have.  But it was just...  It was such a non...  It was not overactive.  It was so...  Just naturally.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what was great about it, because you're doing it every day.  And you're really...  You know, and I took it really serious, and there's just so many ways you could say, pass  the sugar.  It must be sort of...  Like, if it's every day, it must get easier to deliver it naturally, because you're almost... 
[02:24:30]  It is kind of natural.  Totally.  You're with these people every day.  Like you guys with the show.  Right, yeah.  After you just talk, and if it was your first day or whatever, maybe...  Yeah, yeah, a little jittery.  How long have you guys been going out?  Oh, God.  It's riced on a pony.  Going out.  Yeah, it might as well be, right?  We've been out this 18 years.  18 years now.  Shit.  Up in Boston, and then New York.  Was it easy to memorize all that shit?  I can't imagine memorizing all those lines.  You have a whole brand new script.  I was on the first hour and a half show.  We went to an hour and a half, and it was right in the middle of my storyline. 
[02:25:00]  It's just every night, you're just doing it.  Wow.  Just hammering out lines.  Again, it's...  You know, the demands are...  They didn't write any of that shit down on cute cards or anything to help you out?  No, some people used to use them.  I can't imagine memorizing them.  Yeah, they had a...  Well, not a monitor or whatever.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Teleprompter?  Teleprompter.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet some of the older people that were, you know, the patriarchs and matriarchs of  the soap opera family, when you see them, and they're kind of squinting, because you  know they're kind of reading. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  They had their moves, too, to do it.  They made it into, like, a character.  Right.  They're looking away when you're talking to somebody.  They just did it all the time.  They didn't want to memorize it anymore.  Even if they didn't need the lines or not, even if they didn't need the line, they had to  continue it.  Right.  So you get the dialogue the night before.  It's the most amazing thing, and then the next day you've got to shoot all of this pages  of material.  And how many takes do you get to do this?  One. 
[02:26:00]  Jesus.  Maybe they'll go over it once or twice, but it's a machine.  Amazing.  You better be prepared, or they're going to write your ass right off the soap opera.  My favorite with soap operas was, before they'd go to commercial, they'd have the little  teaser there, and somebody would have to look in the camera and go, I just wanted to ask  you something.  And then they'd have to kind of just, like, kind of look into the camera for uncomfortably  too long while it faded to the commercial.  Oh, it's horrible.  Those were horrible.  Really?  They were horrible.  And the best thing is, because back then, you know, I was in my 20s, you know, you'd 
[02:26:30]  like to go out and have fun, so it was always great when you ended up in the hospital.  Because you'd have no lines.  You'd just lay in there.  That was your day off.  So the night before, you knew there was trouble.  You knew stuff was going to happen when you were in the hospital.  How great is that?  Because you don't have to move.  You don't have to do anything.  You just got to fucking lay there.  You didn't have to remember your lines.  What came, like, after that, then? 
[02:27:00]  What got you out of the soaps and into movies?  I just wanted to get into movies.  I was 25, and I moved out to L.A.  I had saved my money.  And then for, like, five years, nothing happened.  I did a couple guest stars.  I did a couple failed series.  One being Casablanca.  As a series?  And David Soule was Rick.  Oh, shit.  Batman Brothers was the piano player.  Wow.  Hector Elizondo was the lieutenant.  Wow.  And I was Sasha the bartender.  That didn't work out. 
[02:27:30]  No, but it was like constantly being in the hospital because I never had anything to say.  They never gave me anything to do.  Did you regret leaving the soap when that was happening?  No.  No?  No.  Well, you really didn't want to do soaps.  No, no, no.  I stayed.  It sounds like it was just time to move on, right?  It's a two-year contract, and, yeah, it was time to go.  Wow.  How'd they get you off the show?  What was the storyline end?  Kit and I got remarried after the annulment.  Of course.  And we went off skiing to Italy.  And that was the end of you? 
[02:28:00]  That was it.  Still there.  Toast.  They just never...  She was gone, too?  Yeah, I guess she did.  I guess I tracked her down.  So right now, it's gone on.  And she's never worked again.  Oh, shit.  Did you ever talk to her again?  No.  So good with you.  Oh, you know how annoyed she must be at home every time Goodfellas comes on?  Her husband's like, I like...  Shut the fuck up.  She did a nine-to-five job.  What was the first movie that actually you were like, okay, now this is what I want to 
[02:28:30]  be doing?  Well, I knew this is what I wanted to be doing, but...  Yeah, yeah.  The first one I hit...  Well, Something Wild was the first movie I did.  Huh.  Then this movie, Dominic and Eugene, then Field of Dreams and Goodfellas.  Yeah, Field of Dreams.  Did you get nominated for Something, for Something Wild?  Or was it still having an award?  Yeah, there was a...  Golden Globe, I think.  Yeah, Golden Globe.  First time out.  Yeah, I didn't win.  But...  That's still amazing.  Just happy to be nominated.  I could have...  Yeah, I was hoping, you know, they did the Newcomer of the Year, but they stopped it 
[02:29:00]  the year before after Pia Zador won for something.  Oh, right.  Yeah, you kind of got Pia Zador with a garden hose in a movie.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Oh!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes, I did.  She was very sexy, wasn't she?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  We shot it in Rome.  It was only supposed to be a couple days.  I ended up there for three weeks.  Your choice.  But, yeah.  You know, I don't think I'm doing this quite right.  I mean, I don't audition for that, but auditioning for that with the casting agent, and then 
[02:29:30]  you got, you know, pretending you're...  Reaping her with those.  Yeah.  And casting directors never give you anything when you read.  It's never, like, a comfortable read.  It's always just a fucking deadpan lines.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why I'm saying that.  I just felt like saying that.  I'm just trying to blame my failures on something.  It's the casting director's fault, right?  It's not mine.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I remember seeing her in a fucking Wii magazine back in, like, the 80s.  Yes, yes.  That was my first heard of her. 
[02:30:00]  She had great boobs.  Didn't she have great tits?  Yes, she did.  Like, cold nipples?  And she was really sexy.  Sorry, Ray.  Pretty girl.  Got off track there.  Who beat you for the Golden Globe?  I disagree.  I don't even remember.  Oh, oh, oh.  I think it was that year's when Platoon came out.  Oh, shit.  So one of the dudes from Platoon.  It was probably Defoe or Berenger, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it was Berenger.  I think.  And then you do Field of Dreams, and then...  So what was Goodfellas?  It wasn't an audition?  Oh, I heard I was the first person that Marty met. 
[02:30:30]  And then, you know, obviously a lot of people were auditioning for it and wanting to meet  him.  But it took about a year.  Holy shit.  Until I finally got it.  And I think what really...  I was in Venice at the Venice Film Festival.  I took my dad, and we were just at the hotel looking down at the lobby, and all of a sudden  there was all this commotion.  So what the heck's going on?  And it was Marty in the middle, surrounded by bodyguards, because he was there for the 
[02:31:00]  last temptation of Christ.  Oh, yeah.  Controversial.  Yeah.  Very controversial.  Wow.  So I said, oh, my God, that's Marty.  I just wanted to connect with him to, you know, put myself in front of him again, because  it was like a couple of months since that first audition, or maybe even...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, for a while.  And then I went down, and I reached for him, and the bodyguards, you know, he turned around,  the bodyguards are coming after me.  I said, no, no, no, no, no, I just want to talk to Marty.  And I was real innocent and afraid.  And he said that's when he knew, because I guess he'd just seen something wild, and 
[02:31:30]  I was just such a maniac in that.  Then Henry was like a nice guy.  The reason why he rose through the ranks is just because they trusted him.  Yeah, yeah.  He did what he was supposed to do.  And he saw that kind of vulnerable moment.  Holy shit.  Isn't it weird how that works?  That's so strange.  I would have just the opposite experience.  I wanted to give this guy the part, and he started to bother me while I was at a press  conference.  Like, he creeped me out.  There's luck involved.  You just don't think there's luck involved like that. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my gosh, a lot of...  Yeah, yeah, obviously.  So he spoke to you at that moment?  Huh?  He talked to you then?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and he went right into the conversation that we had three months ago.  Wow.  He's a really interesting guy.  Really smart, and people just know him as a director.  But he's got a lot of things that he's interested in.  Did you see the George Harrison documentary?  Yeah, I loved it.  It was fantastic, man.  It was great.  I loved it.  Really.  Well done.  He's just...  He puts out great work, man.  Everyone has talked about McCartney and Lennon, and even Ringo so much. 
[02:32:30]  And Harrison's the one that kind of gets glossed over.  He's just the one that people don't talk about.  He had so much going on in his life, too.  He's a really interesting guy.  Yeah, definitely.  A deep guy.  Yeah.  Very strong.  It made you realize the magnitude of the Beatles' success when you realized that this  guy just wanted to fucking plant trees and not talk to anybody after a while.  Dude, he couldn't get his songs through for the most part, Harrison.  Right.  You know, then he ended up having a great solo career.  And then he was a producer.  He had a lot of shit.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  He had a movie producer. 
[02:33:00]  Big Mediterranean.  Time Bandits.  Yeah, Time Bandits.  And Monty Python.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys.  He loved those guys.  Life of Brian.  Oh, we got to wrap up.  Yeah, they're telling everybody he's telling everybody he has other press or whatever.  It always goes fast when raising.  They enjoy having him, man.  Let's give the film the proper plug.  Oscar buzz on this film.  Oh, really?  They're saying Oscar buzz.  Okay, I did know that.  They absolutely are.  Killing Them Softly.  It comes out November the 30th.  This weekend.  Oh, this weekend.  Okay.  It's with Ray and also Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini.  Who else was it? 
[02:33:30]  Richard Jenkins.  Ben Mendelsohn.  And the woman that played Kit on them.  Oh, Ray.  Look her up.  Just find out what happened.  I have to have it up there.  Then I think it comes back.  You've got to know whether something nice, please.  Poor Kit there.  Now I need to know.  We'll do our own research.  Send her skis.  You're cruel.  Ray, thanks so much.  All right.  Ray Leota, man.  Someone just told me that was a big deal for us today. 
[02:34:00]  What?  Because Ray Leota does not do radio.  And I told that guy, Ray Leota did our show about three, four years ago.  Shit.  Fucking that guy ruled.  And then the Who Kid came in to get his picture.  That was pretty funny.  He got slapped down pretty good.  Let's bring the Who Kid in. 
[02:34:30]  Who Kid.  Who Kid.  Who Kid.  Did you come in just for the Ray Leota photo?  Oh, shit.  I was looking at it.  I was showing it.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you just take Jimmy's spot?  Let me tell you something, Opie.  I know what my brothers like.  And they like Goodfellas and Scarface.  Yeah, those are two top N-word movies right there.  You came in just for the photo? 
[02:35:00]  Not early.  Yeah, I flew in from L.A.  I did The Voice.  Yeah, you were on The Voice last night.  You were on The Voice last night?  Yeah, with 50 and Adam Levine.  Very cool.  I got head, too, because being on there, too.  But, yeah.  Pretty huge.  Good for you, brother.  I got the video right here.  I was showing.  That's pretty huge.  Wait, what happened?  He's showing me some fucking video over here.  This is from inside the, uh, the, at The Voice.  In the trailer.  There's like a shower in the trailer.  Who's that?  What happened to your phone? 
[02:35:30]  A ketchup bullet?  Some horror.  No, this is, uh.  Some horror.  No, no, this is, yeah.  This is what I filmed with, but I have my other phone right here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that one's a little busted.  Yeah.  Yeah, so Ray Liotta is, like, he was in here, and I guess you want a picture, obviously.  Yeah, he did a couple movies with 50 Cent, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Ann had a great line that, unfortunately, the audience missed.  That's why I brought you in.  Oh, okay.  Well, me being a racist, I had to, uh.  No, no, I said it.  You didn't hear this?  No, I didn't hear it.  It happened right in front of you.  Did you hear Ray Liotta laughing his ass off? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, I heard him.  That was at your expense.  Oh, right?  You don't even know?  He was taking a picture.  And it was racist.  Oh, it was.  Oh, I love it.  It was a bad.  It wasn't that racist.  No, no, not racist.  Leona, yeah, you and Leona were taking a picture, and, uh, and I said, hey, the stupid motherfucker  left the truck parked out on the street.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that was racist.  And Leona starts cracking up, and he pointed right at me and went, hashtag, hashtag.  And he gave the best laugh ever.  Yo, I love that.  Yo, I saw him. 
[02:36:30]  Yo, I love that guy.  That's a real racist right there.  I love racism in front of my face, man.  I love it, man.  You got it.  It's the only place.  Oh, shit.  Yo, you know, it's not every day people call me the crackhead Samuel L. Jackson.  Yeah, right?  Thought you'd be up here with one of your bitches.  How good were his cheeks in that?  Oh, fucking.  Stacks' ass looked really good in those little underpants he had on.  I just didn't like the way they shot him, though.  Oh, man.  They just banged him, like. 
[02:37:00]  That's it.  That's how that shit works.  Would you rather be hung up in a frozen fucking meat truck?  Like Carbone?  Like Carbone or fucking ice pick in the back of the head?  Or in the garbage?  The guy fell out in the garbage?  Yeah.  That was a really heartless movie.  But at least he got some pussy before he shot his ass, though.  That's true.  That's true.  Did we find that soap actress?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, who was the...  We were talking to Ray Ligota, his early days in soap opera acting.  And he was with his love interest in the soap opera.  We were wondering if she did as well as Ray did. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, because they left the soap opera together.  Yeah, yeah.  They wrote him off.  They both didn't off the show at the same time.  They wrote him off as going to Italy to ski or something.  Yeah.  I gotta pull it up again real quick.  I'm gonna be serious.  I was too good to try.  And then Ray goes on to, obviously, what he has done.  And we're wondering whatever happened to her.  It's amazing.  They kind of started together.  I thought she died.  Did she die?  No.  Oh.  She's someone brought from another world.  Yeah.  Or she was in a car accident or something like that.  In real life?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Let's hope.  How do you know this always goes that way? 
[02:38:00]  Yo, man.  I'm the whitest man in radio, man.  He just lies.  I think he just lies.  No, I'm lying, man.  He's really good at lying.  See?  I knew it.  I've heard you enough to know you're a good liar.  Sounds great.  Sounds good.  That works.  Sounds like it could be.  What the hell?  Fuck it.  Did you ever see his movies with 50?  It was very exciting.  Which movies were those?  How did I miss that?  Can you look that up real quick?  No.  We're going to the soap opera.  How many things at once?  Bradley Bliss.  You never did a movie with 50 Cent?  You mother.  Oh, he did. 
[02:38:30]  Are you sure?  Yeah, he did.  All right.  You can look that up, right?  We've got to see what happened to Bradley Bliss first.  Yeah, we can't do too many things at one time.  What a lovely name, Bradley Bliss.  Samuel wants to say something.  Before you say he did a movie with 50 Cent.  A lot of movies are in theaters.  Yeah.  Some are straight to D&D.  It was exclusively for niggers.  It was straight to D&D.  Oh, okay.  Right.  We don't need theaters, you know?  Niggas don't need that.  It's a scary place.  Straight to D&D, guys.  On the corner of the room.  Street cred.  It went right to DVD.  Straight to DVD package. 
[02:39:00]  He made a lot of money over that, though.  I know they made money over it, because, you know.  Yeah.  What was David?  I need him to look it up.  Jesus.  What happened to Bradley Bliss, the nurse, richest girl in the United States?  Well, her run on Another World ended in 1981, and then she played Girl at Restaurant in  The First Time, and then she played Muffy Baxter on one episode of Guiding Light.  One episode? 
[02:39:30]  One episode.  And then I guess she just had a nice life.  That's it?  That's it?  Wow.  And then Ray Liot is in all that shit he is in?  Only four joints?  Wow.  Shit.  Let me see your picture.  She doesn't have one.  Why would she?  She got fucked.  Oh, she's in that.  That's an IMDb?  No way.  I know.  I think I have better credits than she does on IMDb.  She used to be an actress.  Whatever job she got, she was like, yeah, I used to be an actress.  You know how many times she's fucking had to talk about Ray Liotta to people?  That's her.  Oh, yeah.  Let me say something. 
[02:40:00]  I co-starred with Ray Liotta.  Oh, I know her.  She was hot.  Back in 81.  She got a nice mouth.  Yeah.  Damn.  What do you think she did with her life after that?  She probably got knocked up.  I bet you she got pregnant and had a family when she realized.  So she has a kid out there that she fucking hates.  She probably, yeah.  She's got pictures up on the wall.  That's what she's got.  That's her career.  Of Ray Liotta with holes in them and targets.  She probably tooled around until 1988.  Kept looking.  What was, Danny, what was the last year of her work? 
[02:40:30]  Because she left 81.  So.  84.  Okay, 84.  So you figure she didn't give her up right away.  She probably fucked around for another three or four years.  They were two or three years.  And, uh.  Waiting for Ray Liotta to call her.  Yeah.  For Ray's call.  No, I'm thinking.  There's a little role.  The name of Karen.  I really felt like we bonded.  We bonded.  He'll call.  Yeah.  He'll call.  I'm telling you.  Can you say they spit on their own floors?  Bradley Bliss, yo.  Yeah.  Where is this bitch? 
[02:41:00]  How's that voice show?  Is it all right?  You liked it?  Oh, it was exciting.  It was very, uh, very, I don't know.  Yeah.  Very, like.  They treat you nice?  A lot of energy.  They gave us lobster.  It was crazy.  Holy shit.  Why'd you go there?  Uh, I don't know.  They just told me, yo, you better be there at three o'clock.  And then I saw 50.  And then I saw, you know, a lot of white people.  I see a CeeLo looking like a Christmas ornament.  Like, it was crazy.  I don't know how he dresses like that.  A girl from one of Noam's clubs, though. 
[02:41:30]  I think the Fat Black Pussycat.  Amanda Brown, her name is?  Yeah.  Is that her?  Yeah.  How did she, she sang very well last night.  I don't know if she won or not.  There was a lot of wiggling and stuff, but I don't know how crazy.  Did she do okay?  Yeah, she did okay.  Did she win?  Uh, no.  She lost?  Some gay guy won.  I don't know.  Did she get knocked off?  There's always a gay singer that wins in those days.  It was the whole thing?  That was the finale last night?  No, it was more wiggling and movement.  Is she gone or is she still on?  No, she's still on.  Is he making up all this shit?  No, I'm not.  I keep looking at Sam with shaking his head, because I know this guy lies a lot. 
[02:42:00]  I'm not lying about that, though.  He just fucks around a lot.  A gay guy did win yesterday, though.  Did he?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't even know if I can believe it.  It wasn't the finale yesterday.  It wasn't the finale, but a gay guy did win, though.  Right.  He won for last night.  Right.  It's just sometimes you have to go through and decide.  It's like, you know, you have to go through rolling language.  I know you guys are friends.  Keep this one honest.  You have to go through who kid language.  Like, who kid sprinkles his truths in?  This is what I'm looking at, y'all.  I'm watching this shit.  What are you doing here today? 
[02:42:30]  I got Steve-O.  And then I'm hanging with Steve-O.  So why don't we all do it together?  Oh, that'd be kind of funny.  We bang girls together and shit like that.  It's kind of hell.  Yeah?  I was with him during his heydays of cocaine and all that binging and all that stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that a story?  No, that's real.  Oh, cool.  You do the cocaine.  No, I watched him, though.  You never did it?  Very exciting to watch him do it.  No, it was incredible.  Matt Vank.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if I can say it on air.  Oh, believe me.  There's no secrets. 
[02:43:00]  No secrets here.  I remember one time he hung over in my room in Vegas and I had a big suite.  So I said, yo, you can do whatever you want in this side of the room.  So I went out with this beautiful girl that I just met.  She was some gospel chick or whatever.  So we came back three in the morning.  Cocaine's on the table.  Steve-O's throwing up on the toilet bowl.  And there's like these young 17-year-old chicks wearing my clothes.  Like there's two of them.  Like they're butt naked, but they got my polo shirt.  You know, Ralph Lauren, man.  You don't fuck with a nigga Ralph Lauren shirt. 
[02:43:30]  So I got mad.  But in the corner, there's a dude with a fucking cowboy hat like knocked out.  And the AC was, I swear to God, it was like negative two degrees in the room.  Like Caucasian, like cold.  It was like super ice.  So I was mad.  I popped the hat off.  It was Kid Rock.  That's how we met.  That's how we met.  That's it.  But he said he never had a relationship with Kid Rock.  They were just coke friends. 
[02:44:00]  Wow.  That's fucked up.  He don't know him.  They're just like me.  I guess the drugs just had him be like, I don't know, close and touchy and stuff.  Coke will make friends with anybody.  That's crazy.  Anybody.  Man.  That's amazing.  I'm not making this up.  You can ask him today.  If you have coke and someone wants coke, they are your friend.  They will be your pal.  Yeah.  Having coke really helps you make friends.  Yes.  It's amazing.  Try it, kids.  If you got weed, Snoop Dogg will be your boy.  Yeah.  That's it.  If you ever wanted to meet Snoop Dogg, you'd be a total stranger.  I bet you need good weed. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  He has his own weed, though, doesn't he?  Yeah.  I bet he does always.  I bet he always has his own weed.  He'll take free weed, but if you're like a total stranger and you're a loser, like nobody  wants to be your friend, you want to be Snoop Dogg's friend, get a pound of weed, get  to the concert, and you're getting it, and he's your man.  Nice.  I know what I'd say to him, too.  I have a little bit of chronic.  Wink, wink.  You got to add the bodega in there, too, baby.  Yeah, that's true.  Chronic bodega.  Yeah.  I'll start with that. 
[02:45:00]  I saw him in a junk at one time.  I was doing for, I think it might have been Lucky Louie or something.  It was like six years ago, and he came in with an entourage of people, and I mean a fucking,  he has like six old linebackers from the Rams.  Wow.  You can't carry guns like this place.  They were, they were, no, I don't think any of them were armed because they were being,  you know, it was, everyone was being wandered going in.  Yeah.  He travels with some big guys.  Get the fuck out of here.  Do you know them?  Yeah, I know some of the insecurities he had for years, but they stuffed the guns in their 
[02:45:30]  ass.  What?  Yes.  How do you stuff a gun in your ass?  I didn't ask.  I just saw some wet come out, and it was crazy.  Plastic.  You know what I'm saying?  That is crazy.  I don't know.  You ever heard that?  You're a gun collector expert.  I heard about, yeah, like some kind of polymer guns where.  Or 2-2.  You can't put a 2-2 in your ass?  Um, no, I don't, I don't think I, but maybe a zip gun, one of those that's just the barrel  with like a spring-loaded firing pin.  One shot.  I'm going to come that way, though. 
[02:46:00]  But.  Straight headshots.  I don't know, but you can't put, I heard you could put a 2-2 in your ass, though.  You could probably do that.  Where's the steam?  I wouldn't.  I prefer a holster.  When you're pulling a fucking desert eagle out of your asshole, there's an issue.  There's a problem?  Yeah.  Fucking eagle coming out of there.  Yo, yo, I don't know, man.  The shit people do to fucking conceal weapons, man.  What happened with the gospel singer? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, we're at the show?  No, no.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They come back, Kid Rock's in the corner.  Yeah, she thought I was fucking like, this was my life.  Like, I'm not cokehead.  I don't, you know, I just came back to get some ass.  And then this is what she saw.  Yeah, I still banged her, but when she saw Kid Rock, I banged her.  She didn't know who Steve-O was, but Kid Rock was more famous.  So she's like, ooh, Kid Rock.  Just hanging out in your room.  It's pretty bangy.  I was like, okay.  In your room, I'll fuck you.  Jesus.  Which Kid Rock was it, though?  Was it before Bob, ba-da-da-ba-da-bang-a-bang-dang? 
[02:47:00]  It was.  Or was it like around the Sheryl Crow, a picture of you, fucking Kid Rock?  I think it was around that time.  A picture of you guy?  I think it was around that time, yep.  It was like five, six years ago.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  He used to do our show.  He's a good guy.  He came out with Pam Anderson one time.  Oh, right.  Pam came in, too, right?  No, she wouldn't come in the studio.  Oh, she stayed outside the studio.  I love her, man.  We got her to say hi.  She opened the door or something dumb. 
[02:47:30]  That didn't get her in here?  This is all the studio.  A long time ago.  Oh, okay.  Kid Rock hasn't done our show in 10 years easy.  Wow, serious?  He came on, played, and everything was great.  He's like a country star now, right?  He does more country music.  I like his country stuff better.  Yeah?  I never liked his rap stuff.  I kind of like this.  I kind of like his stuff from across the board.  I like his stuff.  What's his hit record?  What's the hit country record?  I don't think it's a hit one, but I just prefer them.  He did a great stuff on Slash.  He's one called I Hold On.  It was a great one.  Only God Knows Why, I think it's called.  Only God Knows. 
[02:48:00]  What's that one he did at Super Bowl?  America something?  Is that what you mean Super Bowl?  You mean Thanksgiving?  Was it Thanksgiving?  No.  It was Thanksgiving.  That one?  Jesus.  All Summer Long, I think.  All Summer Long was his big fucking...  Yeah, with the fucking Skinner thing.  Oh, yes.  That was good.  That was during the summer of Nicolini.  Remember that whole summer?  Yeah.  Hearing that fucking song while I was banging that Jill Nicolini.  Wow.  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  It is.  It is.  It is.  It is.  Right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woo.  Where are wolves in London?  Oh, yeah.  This reminds me of fucking...  Like a trucker.  Two hands on him.  Two big fucking fake tits.  Woo.  Those clothes.  Jesus.  I'm horny right now.  Fucking Steve-Oy.  Yeah, this is his figure.  I like this.  This is catchy.  It's like a cool country white person song. 
[02:49:00]  And they took, you know, Sweet Home Alabama.  Right?  Yeah, but he's tributing it.  Yeah.  I don't think he was trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes and say that, you know,  this was his own song.  You know?  Well, the blacks do that.  Shout out to Diddy.  Can we get him on the show?  We want to get him on the show.  Do you?  Diddy?  Yeah.  I could probably set that up.  You would interview Diddy? 
[02:49:30]  I'd love to.  When do we get 50 Cent back?  You want 50 to come back, too?  I'd love to.  He was great.  He was fun.  That shouldn't be no problem either.  He surprised the hell out of us.  We didn't know you back then.  Oh, for real?  He was great, man.  He is a smart guy.  Just don't get him angry, you know.  Why?  Shoot you.  Yeah.  Kidnap you.  Stuff like that.  It's crazy.  Kidnap.  Yeah, he kidnapped people before.  And then what does he do?  He just, like, ties them up.  And then it's just awkward.  Feed them, like, biscuits and stuff like that.  It's crazy.  Waits for ransom money? 
[02:50:00]  No, there's no ransom.  You're tied up, B.  You're out of here.  Jesus, what's the end game if it's kidnapping?  I don't know.  Smacking, punching.  It's crazy.  Do you think he's ever shot anyone for real?  Probably back in the days, but how many years has it been?  Because then there's, like, some kind of, like...  Yeah, you're trying to figure out how to get away with what you're about to say.  As long as he didn't kill anyone.  If he killed someone, there is no statute on murder.  But if he just, you know, blow off some rounds in anger.  He definitely did that.  Yeah.  Do him and Rick Ross still not like each other? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, they probably still don't like each other, but it's probably over by now.  Oh, is it?  Black beefs go deep.  Is Rick Ross good?  I never heard his music.  He's, uh...  People like him, I guess, you know.  He says he's good?  Okay.  There's a lot of overweight black people, so they can relate to his fatness.  What is that, the obesity problem in the black community?  I don't know, man.  It's sexy now.  They take their shirts off.  What the fuck is that?  I don't know.  Like, the bitches are all like, like, I look good and shit.  I know girls that don't sleep with him, you know, bang him. 
[02:51:00]  I'm like, where the fuck is his dick at?  He's famous.  That's why.  He's fat, Rick Ross?  Huge.  Oh, okay.  He actually, uh...  I think he fainted on a plane, and then they had the emergency landing joint.  Oh, shit.  Nobody would give him off their mouth.  No.  When was this, recently?  It was like a couple months ago.  Like five months during the summer.  We lost a white bitch.  What?  The fat white bitch.  We never really got to her.  Oh, yeah.  They would let her fall back from Belgium or some shit.  Yeah, they wouldn't let her on the plane.  She was too fat, and then she ends up dying.  She had one leg.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  And still weighed 425.  Ugh, fatso.  She had to get back to her doctor to get some kind of fucking kidney dialysis and all kinds  of shit.  Why are we heartless?  Why are you going on vacation to Europe if you've got to be back before you fucking expire?  That's crazy.  You got to one leg.  You can't walk anywhere.  No.  425 with one leg.  He has no shirt on there.  Okay.  Holy shit.  He's fatter than I thought he was.  I knew he was a big guy, but I didn't realize he was that heavy.  You thought I was exaggerating, but look how big he is.  You all tied it up, too, man.  Some girls don't know where his dick is.  I know girls are like, wow, I never saw it, but... 
[02:52:00]  Holy shit.  He made it to the cover of Rolling Stone?  Yeah, he's very popular.  Why would they let him take his picture like that without pulling his pants up?  Did anyone tell him that...  Let me see, Danny.  That's just a scene.  Your pants have fallen down, for the love of God.  Pull him up.  Yo, man, that's some real nigga shit right there.  Rolling Stone allows that.  Right?  That's crazy.  They were scared.  Gangster.  I never saw Kiss or anybody doing that back in the...  They never had their pants sagging and their dicks up.  No, but they did have weird stuff.  I have to say, they had their own.  They had makeup and, you know, and seven-inch heels.  Okay.  Our white rock stars wear women's clothes there. 
[02:52:30]  Mick Jagger, Steven Tyler, they love the women's clothes.  The rappers use that prison sheet, because you can't have, like, belts in jail, right?  So I think that's where that came from, was the pants hanging down.  Is that where that all started?  That's what I was talking about.  They know how to make stills in fucking jail, but they couldn't make a belt.  I don't buy it.  But that's like onstage costume.  These guys wear it every day.  Like, they go to church.  They go to Starbucks.  They dress like that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Walk around the streets.  It's like grunge.  It's a cultural thing.  Grunge kids dress like that. 
[02:53:00]  I would love to see you with second pants.  That's not going to happen.  I'm not very good at being urban.  I'm a very white guy.  You said you had a black bitch before.  Yeah.  Yeah, I fucked up a few of them, but, I mean, prostitutes crosses all fucking...  Green is the color that matters there.  It wasn't on my merits or the content of my character, the contents of my wallet.  My crack hangs out.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not like the homies, though.  No, I don't have my underpants pulled up.  Everything just kind of fucking hangs out.  Like right above the knees. 
[02:53:30]  It's hilarious.  Yeah, I got a little top crack hangs out every once in a while.  When the pants are right above the knees.  You got a little Harlem out there?  Yeah, man.  You got the boxed shorts, the pants right above the knees, belted.  I'm just a slob is what it is.  And then you just got to walk like this.  It's such a silly look.  You got to get that fucking walk.  It's hilarious.  Don't the pants get filthy dragging on the ground?  Yeah, it does.  That's hilarious.  That shirt.  Look at that shirt.  Can you explain how they don't fall all the way to the ground?  That's all I want to know today.  They're like midgets. 
[02:54:00]  Like I got jeans that if I don't wear a belt, they're going to fall all the way to the ground.  No, you know what it is?  But how do they do that?  No, the key thing is you wear shorts under the jeans.  Like I have shorts under the jeans.  I can show you.  Yeah, yeah.  Why shorts?  It keeps like the hoodness, like the gangster look.  Yeah, so then you can pull them down.  It's called Tupacism.  You're still wearing fucking pants.  How does it make it gangster?  I'm just looking at your jeans.  But how do the jeans not fall to the ground?  Is that popular?  The shorts?  You wear shorts.  Hell yeah.  You wear the shorts.  I mean, the bowls are spicy, but we got to deal with it.  The bowls are spicy. 
[02:54:30]  It's hot in that bitch, man.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like an oven in there, but girls don't like it, bro.  They're liking a crock pot and shit.  Oh, shit.  You ever have a girl say, I had a girl, I've told this story before, but I had a girl,  she used to blow me, and when I was drinking when I was like 16, my fucking bag would sweat,  and my balls smelled so bad, I put talcum powder on them.  Steve-O, what's up, buddy?  How that work?  Hi, buddy.  Take a seat.  Stay in.  All right, they do know each other.  Put it up, my brother.  Holy shit. 
[02:55:00]  Who kid was telling some stories today, Steve-O?  Yeah, me and you.  Who kid?  Pop one over to the right.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, dude.  You guys think I lied, but you know.  Well, you've always been a little bit liberal with the truth.  That's cool, man.  I told him about the story with the kid rocking the room.  Right, right, right, right.  That's fucking hilarious, man.  I'll never forget the size of that rubber I found in your bathroom after that.  Really? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  Big fucking maxill.  Yeah, the serious fucking magnum.  I looked at him before, and I was like, man.  I think Steve-O saw my dick.  No homo, but.  It was all full of jizz.  Yeah.  Jackets.  Steve goes, yeah.  That is correct, man.  Did you eat it like space food?  Why would you use a rubber?  What's wrong with you?  I mean, I don't know.  I wasn't thinking.  What's that shit?  Yeah, have some diggity.  I was trying to be like.  I was trying to do some jackass shit. 
[02:56:00]  There's a difference there.  His kind of, they like to have the kids.  Oh, boy.  That could be a problem, right?  Steve-O pulls out.  I still don't know.  I can't believe all the rawness.  He don't have no children.  Yeah.  You're like a pull-out king, son.  I am.  Pulling out is important.  Perfect timing?  You know how to time it perfectly?  Yeah.  I even like to be a little early.  You know?  Yeah, I'd be able to give myself some time to aim.  Right, right.  He banged the girl.  I swear to God.  I timed you, right? 
[02:56:30]  I timed him.  It was like four minutes and like 20 seconds.  It was Beverly Hills Hotel.  I timed you.  You banged her in my room.  Four minutes and 20 seconds.  God, you guys really do know each other.  Fuck.  I remember one time.  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  Well, it was just kind of funny.  Like, we were in Orlando filming Jackass No. 2.  And some kid came up to Knoxville and he was like, hey, man.  Like, I'm trying to get into acting.  Like, here's my idea.  I don't know.  You know, he says, you just never do know. 
[02:57:00]  And so I want to give this to you.  And it was his headshot.  This black and white headshot of this, like, young kid.  This dude.  And so we pulled up back to the hotel and I was like, hey, Knoxville, let me get that fucking headshot.  And I go, start timing.  I go, start timing.  And I went hauling ass, running up to my room.  Just so fucking fast.  Running up the room.  Opened the door.  Ran in.  Fucking jacked off.  Cumbed all over this kid's face on his headshot.  Came running back down to the lobby and slapped it onto the window of the hotel lobby. 
[02:57:30]  And it's stuck there.  And I was like, what's my time?  Because they were timing.  And it was less than two minutes.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I think it was more like a minute.  I think it was more like a minute and a half.  And we were in that hotel for a good.  It must have been cute.  We were in that hotel for a good two weeks, I think.  And the photo never came down.  That comes like wallpaper paste.  That's just going to stay on that window.  Holy fuck.  He's not making this up either. 
[02:58:00]  I lied, but this guy's the truth.  Did he ever get into acting, the kid?  If I saw that kid, I'd recognize him.  He has not done shit.  Oh, fuck, man.  Now, Steve-O, you got a show.  Look at this.  We're seeing Steve-O on TV.  Yep.  Not hurting himself.  Right.  Not hurting himself.  Yeah.  Wow.  Regular old funny guy.  Now, you've managed to combine karaoke with fucking with people. 
[02:58:30]  Sure.  People are singing karaoke while horrible shit happens to them.  Right.  And now, what's the object of this?  You've got to continue singing?  It seems to be hilarious.  Oh, okay.  People are singing, and they're getting electrocuted.  And, you know, they keep singing, you know.  And whoever the audience likes from each round, there's six contestants per show, three rounds  of competition. 
[02:59:00]  Audience votes.  God, I'm boring.  I'm boring myself.  So, no, no, no.  Do they like audience votes and whatever?  Does the audience tend to like people that sing better, or people that can go through  the shit and keep going?  I think that the audience is looking for commitment.  Commitment.  Commitment to song.  Commitment to performance.  Right.  This is just like the voice.  So, if you can plow through.  He's killing, what's the name, Christina Aguilera.  I don't know why he hates her. 
[02:59:30]  I don't hate her.  I don't hate her.  She's just a fucking rude.  She's kind of cunty on that show.  Absolutely.  I can't remember, because it was years ago, but I seem to recall her being kind of rude  and cunty to me.  Really?  But who wouldn't be?  When she was hot.  I'm an asshole.  When she was hot.  When she was hot, probably.  She was fucking crazy.  She looks more and more like Snooki.  Oh, man.  That's the same person.  She's kind of getting fucking fireplug looking. 
[03:00:00]  You know me in the Texas you gave me yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a good time, man.  It was a good time.  What is that about?  You don't want to know.  Kids just hints to everything.  Well, he texted me.  And I wasn't the one attacking X-Dina.  I texted Who Kid yesterday.  I said, yeah, dude, I'm psyched to hang out tomorrow.  And he said, oh, I'm coming home.  I'm flying home right now.  Just got done doing the voice.  And I just wrote, how fat is Christina? 
[03:00:30]  Can't make this up, man.  She is.  And then he wrote, we texted each other simultaneously.  I wrote fatter than shit.  He wrote unbelievably fat.  Damn.  I didn't check my shit yet.  But the thing is, we're not saying that.  I mean, she's rocking it now, you know?  She's wearing some skin-tight fat shit, you know?  She's got some tit hanging out.  When she was doing that fucking video in the boxing ring.  Oh, God. 
[03:01:00]  Wow.  Fuck, that was hot.  I can't believe it's the same person.  I can't believe it's the same person.  I can't believe it's the same person.  I can't believe it's the same person.  I can't believe it's the same person.  It's amazing it's the same person.  Yeah.  But whatever, man.  Do you feel bad about it?  No, I'm feeling bad about saying all that.  Oh, shit.  Don't feel bad.  But it's cool, you know, like, at a certain point, there's got to be some separation between  Steve-O and the other guy.  And you.  Steve-O's a wild asshole.  Right.  But entertaining.  Steve-O's entertaining.  Do you change your fuck tattoo to, say, rock when you're on TV?  Yeah, yeah.  Did I see that?  Right, right, right. 
[03:01:30]  Or did I dream that?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, rock.  I thought your knuckles said fuck, and I saw you recently.  I saw the show, actually.  Well, thanks, man.  I saw the one with the wheel where they're spinning around real fast.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wait, he turned his tattoo into a rock for TV.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So you can easily make that into an R.  Oh, right.  What does your shit say?  I save.  See, the H I make into an A, and that I turn into a V.  That's real shit right there.  Save rock.  I did pick up on that.  Is that a shit fuck?  Because I thought it was weird that you would just have rock on your knuckles.  I'm like, no, I think it was fucked.  Right, right. 
[03:02:00]  I thought that getting shit fucked tattooed on my knuckles would make me a legend.  Yeah.  Nobody fucking knows about it, man.  Oh, man.  He got a dick on his arm.  Look at that.  Look at that dick.  October 2003.  That's gangster.  That's some real shit.  Why are you a dick?  Yeah, what's the dick one?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, you got the blood and the Crips tattoo.  Holy shit.  Yo, that's some Tupac shit.  Blood and Crips shit.  And I got Christina Aguilera.  Outline of a fat broad.  There's a silhouette of a fat broad sitting down tattooed on your side. 
[03:02:30]  What's the fucking, what's the, what's the, what's the idea behind that?  No, the fat broad.  Someone showed me a t-shirt.  It was like an obese mudflap girl.  And I just laughed and ran to the tattoo parlor.  How many tattoos you got now?  Holy shit.  You know, a number is difficult to gauge.  I'd say maybe 25, but some have been works in progress.  What's this on your arm?  It's fading off.  Oh, this one right here. 
[03:03:00]  I had a guy fucking a baby.  Yeah.  Like sodomizing a baby.  Yeah.  And I realized I crossed the line.  So I'm sorry.  I went, I went.  You had a black baby dinner.  I blobbed.  I would turn into a black blob.  Okay.  And then it was like, then I turned the black blob into an ostrich.  Ostrich.  So now it's a guy fucking an ostrich.  Yeah, you know, it's a pretty rad tattooing when the cover up is a guy fucking an ostrich.  Who's the guy that we had in here that did that?  What the fuck?  Eric.  No.  The guy from the Miami Ink guy. 
[03:03:30]  No, there's a.  Oh, help me out.  One of the most famous stories.  He said, fuck, a musician.  It's one of our legendary stories.  The guy said one of his road guys fucked an ostrich.  Really fucked an ostrich?  Oh.  Damn.  Ministry.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Al Jorgensen came in and told that wild story.  I wasn't sure if you were talking about a tattoo, tattoo removal.  Oh, no, no, no.  I was just.  Or fucking an ostrich.  It was like.  Fucking an ostrich was way down on the list there.  Right?  Did you see that Crips and Bloods again? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Is that a problem, that tattoo?  Who came?  No, it's neutral, you know.  That's all right.  If he's a Crips nigga, you know, he's repping him.  If he's a blood nigga, he's repping him.  Gangster.  Okay.  He was a nigga before.  He's still a nigga, right?  I think you can say that.  We got to get the basics out.  I don't even know what channel the show's on.  It's karaoke show, right?  True TV.  It is true TV.  Yeah.  Because we were just flipping around.  I saw it.  I stopped.  I was like, I got to check out what Steve was up to.  Well, thanks, man.  It's Friday nights at 9 p.m. on True TV. 
[03:04:30]  It's a good laugh.  Yeah.  You should have brought the dog collars and tested on Jim.  Ah, no.  I wouldn't do that.  I'm a baby.  I can't do that stuff.  You wouldn't let him shock you?  No.  No.  I would dislike that a lot, actually.  Discovered any real talents on there, the show?  Any vocal talents?  Nobody's getting a record deal.  No.  I guess it is like The Voice.  Oh, shit.  You know, 50 was on there yesterday. 
[03:05:00]  But 50, it's different.  Road Tech.  All right.  It was Al Jorgensen's Road Tech.  Yeah, okay.  That was a legendary story.  Maybe you played at the time.  Now The Voice is cool, right?  Yeah, it was a good time.  Were you guys on The Voice that we went?  Yeah, we performed it.  It was really good.  Oh, okay.  It was incredible.  What song?  It's a new song called My Life with Adam Levine and Eminem and 50.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Was Eminem there?  No, Eminem is going on Saturday Night Live, so I don't know.  All right.  Is he?  When's he on SNL?  What does Em have coming out? 
[03:05:30]  He's working on it now.  So, I don't know.  This white bitch I fucked the other day told me, I think, you know, I'm my man.  Now you're crossing the line like a baby fucking tattoo over here.  Detroit baby.  Oh, man.  I dig the way you operate, who kid, man.  I really do.  I try to be, you know, try to be like you, man.  How was that last time?  Did we hug each other?  Huh?  That last time in Vegas.  There was many times in Vegas.  Well, yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  But just recently.  Like, I had that pack of Canadian chicks.  Yeah, he gave me a bitch, too.  Yo, I love you, man.  Wow.  Yo, he gave me a bitch.  It was so random.  He's like, yo, you want this bitch?  I was like, wow.  He don't drink, no.  He don't drink no drugs, nothing.  That's true.  Right.  He left the club.  I was shocked, but he still wants pussy.  I had to go home and park in the pink zone.  I know.  That was crazy, son.  You still doing all right?  How many did you bang?  I just, it was just one.  He had 10 Canadian bitches with him.  He sent me a, he texted me the photo.  Oh, shit. 
[03:06:30]  I was like, me as a nigga.  I was like, yo, I'm coming there.  You know what I mean?  And it was so funny because I had like 10 chicks with me.  And who could, he's like, okay, I'll come pick you up.  So he comes to pick me up in this like two-seat car.  And we made all the chicks take a cab and go, you guys.  Holy shit.  That's a real nigga shit.  That really is.  It was real, though.  Yeah, it was hilarious.  Holy fuck.  You doing all right with the drugs and the alcohol?  Yeah, man.  Still doing well?  Coming up on five years.  Jesus Christ.  That's amazing.  That's incredible.  Fuck, man.  I appreciate that.  How about you? 
[03:07:00]  February of 87, however long that is.  Wow.  It's 25.  Coming up on 26 years.  Yeah.  26 in February, right?  Seriously?  Fuck, yeah.  Wow.  Mine's 3 a.m.  I'm too old to start, right?  I'm like 41.  Can I start now?  You'll just fall apart.  You better just keep fucking.  You're not a big partier?  I never did coke ever in my life.  Oh, man.  Just a little drinking?  That's about it.  I saw Steve-O did it and I was excited, but that's it.  Isn't it fun to even watch?  I wasn't exactly making it look good. 
[03:07:30]  Who's that?  Who's that chick?  I think I was...  Who the fuck's that?  I was one of the more effective tools in the war on drugs.  I was one of the most effective tools in the war on drugs.  Atlanta?  Oh, it's one of the housewives of Atlanta.  Atlanta.  I don't watch that one.  I don't even know her.  Who's that?  I watch the Jersey and the Beverly Hills.  I don't watch the fucking Atlanta.  Oh, that's Tendi.  Her name is Tendi.  Is it Tendi?  No.  What?  Kenya.  Kenya.  Kenya.  Tendi.  I'm excited. 
[03:08:00]  I made that up.  Kenya.  I'm as white as you guys.  I don't even watch that show, man.  No.  I don't know shit.  How are you doing stand-up-wise?  It's been good, man.  You still doing it?  Yeah.  I've been doing it like crazy, man.  It's a good time.  I've been actually at the point where I'm going back to places like the second time on the  second loop around.  Right.  And that's kind of stressful because you want to have all new stuff.  And I'm going back to places with like, I don't know, maybe 40% new and doing like 
[03:08:30]  60% old.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, that's cool.  You approve.  I always feel like kind of fucking lame about that.  You know?  I mean, you know.  But the old bits get better.  They genuinely do.  You know?  And you shed them.  Once you shoot something, once you film something for a special, then it tends to go away.  Yeah.  Like once you put it on film, then you're like, all right, I'm done with it.  Some people don't, though, right?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I don't know how they can.  Some just keep fucking doing the same shit.  That's amazing.  Once it's on a special, I don't know how you ever do it again.  Yeah.  It's just tough when, it's frustrating when you're like, I need to come up with new shit, 
[03:09:00]  you know?  I got all deliberate about it.  And I was like, fuck, you know?  And I started writing like, you know, what's going on with me?  I'm thinking, oh, I'm fucking getting, like, I'm 38 now.  And I think fucking God hates us.  And this is my whole new bit is God hates us.  As a human race?  Well, no, I think our fucking existence is a cruel prank on us.  Because how can you explain that we have one instinct, which is to survive, and one guarantee, 
[03:09:30]  which is we won't.  That's pretty heavy there, Steve.  Yeah, I know.  And it's really dark and fucked up.  I don't know.  That's pretty cool, though.  And we get old, and it's like, I think God hates us because, like, you know, fucking,  he picked humans to be the only living thing that can watch and have an opinion of itself  wilting, you know?  A fucking banana doesn't look in the mirror and think, like, getting some spots, you know?  A fucking banana doesn't say, I'm bruising!  I'm bruising! 
[03:10:00]  A fucking banana skin spot cream, yeah.  Yeah, a carton of milk doesn't look at the calendar and think, oh, my best before date's  creeping up on me.  That's true, but a banana has never had its cock sucked after a gig.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good shit, but anyway, I don't know.  That's some real shit right there.  That's some real shit right there.  It's so much better when you're talking about, like, three chicks sucking your dick and stuff.  Yeah, a little easier. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  Damn.  Do you have any workout, please?  I mean, for material.  I live a block away from the Laugh Factory now.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  It helps.  Yeah, that's cool.  That place you just walk into and bomb when you need to.  Like, when this is good, that's the way the new shit comes out.  It's just walking up.  Yeah, walking there, bomb, or show up at the opening Anthony show and bomb.  Oh, you're kidding?  Yeah, dude.  No, but it's a good thing to do.  Walk into a club.  Yeah, just walk out.  Sure, man.  Fucking, you know, half it works, half it's... 
[03:11:00]  It's actually funny.  I saw his first show.  Hilarious.  Is that Caroline's?  I was on the floor peeing him as a...  Oh, right, Caroline's.  I remember when he did that one.  I appreciate that, who, kid.  I mean, you know.  That was an honor to have you there, man.  I didn't even tell him I was going.  I just, like, put my mistress and shit, you know?  How did you guys be?  It's crazy.  How did we...  We met back in...  I don't remember, son.  It was July of 2004.  You remember that shit?  Yeah, because I remember the night before, I had done a show with Old Dirty Bastard.  Oh, that's when you stuck your dick on me and beat you up.  Dude, I could...  There's no gayness with Wu-Tang, man. 
[03:11:30]  No, huh?  Well, no, that was later.  That was later when...  That was a whole other story.  But no, I was doing a show at the Hammersmith Ballroom, if that's what it's called.  Hammerstein.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  And they had, like, all different shows going on.  And I was on the same bill with ODB.  And I wanted to meet him so I could say, dude, I was in your jail cell, you know?  Like, because they told me when I was in protective custody at L.A. County Jail, they're like, yeah, you're on Robert Downey Jr. block. 
[03:12:00]  And, you know, ODB's always in here.  You're in his cell.  So I go into the room that ODB's performing in.  And he's fucking smoking PCP on stage, sharing it with the crowd, with his fucking pants down.  And I'm not, like, I'm not even exaggerating.  His fucking pants were down.  I'm talking, like, uncircumcised pants down.  You know?  Smoking PCP, sharing it with the crowd.  And I'm just like, I can't even fucking believe this.  So I come, I walk my way up to the stage, and one of the people, like, in his crew, they see me by the stage. 
[03:12:30]  They're like, no way, Steve-O, come on up.  So I get up on the stage, and ODB's, and I had my little camera because I wanted to get a picture with him.  And I'm making these little quick-time videos of ODB rapping.  And I made, like, three videos.  The first one, like, he's still rapping.  You know?  The second one, he's really slowing down.  You know?  He's really deteriorating.  And then the third one, the third one, he's just straight sitting on the drum riser, slumped over,  still holding the mic and the joint of BCP, and just motionless. 
[03:13:00]  Just passed out.  Oh, shit.  This is like the sequence of videos.  And I just couldn't even believe it.  It was so fucking rad.  And the next morning, I'm still in New York.  The next morning, you know, I come over to be on G-Unit Radio with Who Kid.  Oh, man.  And I was telling the whole story, and I think, God, it was the wildest.  I was bugged out.  I was like, what the fuck?  It was the wildest.  Did you actually meet him that night?  I did not.  No, I didn't.  I was just on the, he was passed out by the time.  And then I took off, so I didn't ever actually get to introduce myself. 
[03:13:30]  What was your next interaction that Hookie was talking about?  I brought weed to the studio.  We rolled a joint.  The next interaction, that's a much juicier story.  This was after ODB passed.  It was summer of 2006.  They had the, what did they call that Wu-Tang tour?  Wu-Tang Forever.  No, no, it was Rock the Bells.  Yeah.  Rock the Bells.  So, Wu-Tang's headlining.  I'm drinking all day.  They're taking forever to get on stage.  By the time I get on, I'm just fucking hammered. 
[03:14:00]  And I've got this thing where, you know, I'm going to do this stunt during the tribute to ODB portion of the show.  Oh, shit.  And I'm telling Method Man, I'm like, I'm telling Method Man, it's going to be great, man.  I'm going to come on stage with you guys when you guys honor ODB.  And I'm going to fucking strip naked.  I'm going to fucking wiggle my balls and dick back and forth and catch them in, like, a mangina position, you know?  I call that the double back.  You know, I fucking thrust back and forth and I fling it all back and I catch it, you know? 
[03:14:30]  And then once I've got it, like, the mangina, then I'm going to do a standing back flip.  It's called a double back back flip.  And so then, and Method Man, I'm telling this to you, he's kind of cracking up.  And then I'm like, oh, okay, it's going, I'm all drunk.  And then later he comes up to me before they go on.  He goes, dude, you can't do that.  You can't do that.  Dude, they're going to fucking kick your ass, dude.  They're not cool with that.  Holy shit.  Because you can't do that.  And I said, I said, let them kick my ass. 
[03:15:00]  That's what ODB would want.  You know?  Oh, my God.  And so I'm just hammered.  Oh, no, Steve.  So the time comes, they've got ODB's mom on the stage.  Oh, my God.  You know, they're doing the whole thing.  And in my defense, Method Man did hand me the mic.  I don't know if that's in my defense or not.  But he handed me the mic. 
[03:15:30]  And so, you know, I tell the whole story.  I was in jail and I was in his, you know, they said I was in his cell.  Now I'm going to do something for ODB.  You know, I'm going to get naked.  And so I strip off my clothes.  And on the foot, because I had someone filming it.  Everybody's still laughing.  Everybody had a sense of humor about it.  They're all like, oh, damn, this guy's crazy.  You know, and I flip my balls and I dig back and forth.  I do the back flip.  Everybody's laughing.  Everybody's laughing.  I didn't think you'd get that far.  Yeah, I did.  I got that far.  Then they went into, like, Shimmy Yeah.  And then they played, like, Brooklyn Zoo. 
[03:16:00]  Everyone's dancing around.  I'm all dressed.  I even gave ODB's mom a hug after the whole thing.  She said that I was the son that she never had.  It was like a touching one.  With Dicko.  Well, no, I didn't know how I did that then.  But then after, like, the two ODB songs, almost like as an afterthought, and I'm still out there on the stage,  all of a sudden, Raekwon, who's the Wu-Tang guy, Raekwon, he grabs me all violent by my neck and just drags me out to the center stage. 
[03:16:30]  And he says, you know how his brother wasn't there to defend himself from that faggotry and shit, you know?  Faggotry.  And something like that.  And, like, you know, and, like, and I'm going to apologize right now or he's going to knock me out.  And he doesn't care if he goes to jail.  And I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Oh, you said you're sorry, quick.  I said I'm sorry so fast, man.  And that was about, I really did look like a bitch.  Oh, man. 
[03:17:00]  And Raekwon was, like, you know, like, the, what do you call it?  The fucking, I'm trying to look at it.  He was a fucking gangster.  That's a consummate gangster.  He was a consummate gangster.  And then security said, hey, you got to get out of here or you're going to die.  Wow.  I'm shocked he didn't get his ass killed, though.  He had 15 security guards, like, ushered me into, like, a car and got him.  He got fucking balls.  I was really embarrassed about that.  Literally.  Why did he get the literally?  I was genuinely, genuinely embarrassed.  Why did he do that? 
[03:17:30]  Like, that.  Why did he wait?  Why did he wait and do it as an afterthought?  I don't really know.  The problem was in shock.  Because, you know, when black people see white balls, it was just like a shock.  But you hugged his mom.  That was also Raekwon's mom, right?  No, that was.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  You look like Raekwon's mom?  No, no, no.  Did he say, said, by brother, he means, uh...  Right, right, right, right, right.  Oh, he wasn't saying that they're actually brothers.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe they were actual bloodbaths.  No, no, no, no, no.  It wasn't like that.  So it was annoying him while it happened.  They called each other brothers, Jimmy.  I think it was.  Yeah, it was annoying while it happened. 
[03:18:00]  And then it just kind of built up.  And then all of a sudden he snapped.  Did you see him, man?  I think he was even extra angry when he got to me.  Because he didn't let it go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He dragged me.  Grab your neck?  Did you see him walking up to you?  That sounds the way it does.  Dude, did you see him walking up to you?  I did.  I didn't.  It was out of blue.  Were you laughing for a second because you thought it was a joke?  No, no.  You knew?  I knew.  I knew that shit was...  He's a little bit of oxygen.  Oh, shit.  I knew that shit was dead, dead serious.  Wow, that's crazy.  So you apologized?  What was the crowd doing when you did that? 
[03:18:30]  I apologize.  And I mean, I was just like the bitch on stage.  You know, I've had people come up to me and they're like,  Oh, dude, I was at that show.  I was laughing, but whatever.  In prison, that would have been a rape right there.  You know, I guess so.  You'd have been like, Oh, yeah, fuck me, fuck me.  Have you seen him since?  Ray Kwan?  I haven't seen Ray Kwan since, but I've seen...  I saw RZA since then.  Yeah, RZA was in here.  Yeah, he was in RZA.  He's a cool guy. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, I saw RZA at the VMAs and I went up to him and I was like,  Hey, man, I really owe you an apology for that.  And he said, Oh, come on, dude.  We're all cool with you, you know?  Hey, like...  I'd love to see Ray Kwan and say something.  He's like the gangster of all Wu-Tang.  He's like the killer.  Ray Kwan is the real deal?  Yeah, he's like, Oh, my God.  He tied...  I've known...  He tied an artist, like a famous artist.  Tied him?  Tied him up and held him and filmed him and everything.  Why did he do that?  Why I'm saying it's an ONA, but...  Why did he do that?  Is he all money? 
[03:19:30]  For the black community out there, yeah.  Yeah, right?  I guess there's a certain artist that dissed him and then he kidnapped the artist, tied  him up and filmed him.  I'm not going to say the name.  Give us a quote.  Was it Sherman Hemsley?  We're not brave enough to say it.  Write it down.  I'm not brave enough either.  No, just write...  I just wanted to know.  So he kidnapped the artist who dissed him.  Was it a rap?  Wow.  Was it an artist that we'd be shocked to hear it or was it like an actor who you wouldn't  be surprised to hear got punked?  You wouldn't be kind of shocked, but you'd be like, Damn, that's fucked up, man. 
[03:20:00]  And he filmed him what?  What did he film him?  Tied up?  Probably.  Y'all know him, you pussy up.  You little bitch-ass motherfucker.  Yeah, probably he'd call me your daddy and stuff like that.  Just don't fuck with Rick Warren.  That's it.  But he did.  And he survived.  He's a survivor here.  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't my intention to.  I mean, like, and, you know, my heart was in the right place.  I guess my penis...  Yeah, you're sticking balls.  Wrong place.  That makes sense.  Right. 
[03:20:30]  Now I want to interview Ray Kwan.  Can you get Ray Kwan on the show?  I could definitely get Ray Kwan up here.  I would love to talk to him.  I would love to make it right, you know?  Gangster.  Fuck that.  I'd love to make it right.  And I guess, like, as much as, like, it was embarrassing for me and I definitely, it  hurt my feelings and all that, I got to give myself some props because that was a fucking  crazy thing to do.  Method Man told me I would get my ass kicked and I was like, fucking let him.  Yeah, I was like, love him and I went to him.  All right.  I'm surprised he didn't crack you in the face when he had you, you know. 
[03:21:00]  That goes up there, I think, with one of my gnarlier stunts.  So none of the guys jumped in to help you when Ray Kwan grabbed you?  No, I was on my own and they didn't have a...  That, my apology came pretty quick.  You should have filmed a segment for Wild Boys.  It all exists on video.  I want to see that.  It all exists on video.  That'd be great to see, right?  What is the number one stunt?  Oh, man, I don't know.  Like, my favorites, I would say, jumping out of an airplane with no parachute into the  ocean. 
[03:21:30]  What the fuck?  Injecting five ounces of vodka into my arm through an IV.  Right, I remember that one.  Yeah.  And getting strangled unconscious six times in a row.  Wait, what's the...  What's the no parachute one?  I don't know if I know that.  It was on my first Stevo video.  It was a sea glider airplane and it took off and I jumped out with no parachute into the  ocean.  How high up were you?  The higher up, it was the safer.  The lower is where you're going to get real whiplash, you know, or whatever.  How high were you? 
[03:22:00]  I guess 45 feet, maybe 45 miles an hour or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It was doable, but it knocked the wind out of me.  I was trying to scream for help, but I had no wind.  I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, man.  You know, I couldn't even scream for help.  Just from 45 feet?  Yeah.  I mean, the plane's pretty fucking high and the plane's moving.  And the plane's flying, so when you hit, your body's going to keep going when you hit  the water.  I was flying in the whole lane and I landed on my side.  Did you have people that actually, like, did some math or did you just go, ah, 45 feet  sounds good?  Like, you know, I don't know.  Like, earlier that day, I had, I'd been car surfing on a car going 30 miles an hour and 
[03:22:30]  did a flip off the car over a bridge while it was moving.  Okay.  And, uh, and we rented jet skis to film it from.  So, I, when we returned the jet ski, I told the jet ski guy, I was like, oh, dude, and  check out what we just did.  I pulled out the little screen on the camera and showed it to him.  And, uh, and the guy looked at the, my stunt jumping off the car and he says, dude, you  got to jump out of my plane.  Oh, no.  Because I've been flying this plane for years and everybody's all asking me to jump out 
[03:23:00]  of it.  And, uh, I haven't let anybody, but secretly, I don't, I don't want to fucking see that shit  and you're the guy.  Wow.  And he was worried about me getting in, going into the, because there's that propeller on  the back, you know?  And yeah, he, he was worried about that.  And I was like, oh, I'll, I'll clear the propeller.  But I was worried about the water because going that fast and from that high, like the water's  like fucking concrete.  How did you know you'd clear the propeller?  Who says I'll clear the propeller?  Don't worry about that.  I looked at the plane and I could just tell that, that, you know, I could just tell that, you 
[03:23:30]  know, I had, I could push off, you know, I knew I, I knew I had that, but I was worried  about hitting the water.  So the fucking pilot is filming this.  It's, it's basically a glorified fucking hang glider with a fucking propeller on the  back, you know?  So it's like a bar that he holds to fly.  He's got one, one hand on the bar and he's filming with the other hand, with the camera  backwards, filming backwards over his shoulder.  And, uh, my fucking coked out bros fucking, we're up for three days before this. 
[03:24:00]  Right.  You know, they're filming with a VHSC camera from a jet ski.  I had no fucking reason to believe that I would actually get the footage, but I couldn't  turn down the opportunity.  Did you get the footage?  Yeah.  It came out perfect.  Wow, man.  That's some crazy shit.  I'm going to go check that out today.  That's some crazy shit, Steve, son.  Yeah, that was on my first Steve-O video.  Damn.  Steve's done some fucked up shit.  Yo, he fought a pilot one time on a private jet.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know if I fought him.  Well, you grabbed him.  I was just trying to hug him.  Yeah.  Wow, he's flying.  He's flying.  Yeah, it's probably an issue.  It took, like, me and, like, two other black dudes to bring him down in the plane.  Wow.  Because he was zeeked out of control.  Where were you going?  We were going from L.A. to Phoenix, right?  Right.  Good.  And he was, first of all, it was 120 in Phoenix.  I don't know, like, I don't know if that was as much the issue, but, uh.  You hugged him while he was like, yo, like.  The pilot was like, what's going on here?  What's this white guy hugging me like?  It's crazy.  Oh, man.  The plane was like.  Wait, are you trying to tell me the pilot was black? 
[03:25:00]  Nah, it was a white pilot.  Oh.  Come on, man.  Let's be real here.  Jeez.  You want a white pilot, too, don't you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shit, safety first.  Who are you doing in L.A.?  Safety first.  It's a fucking hook.  Yeah, it was a fucking war.  I fucked him for a show, but he was so zeeked up, I had to fly to L.A. to pick him up from his apartment.  Holy shit.  Because he ain't going to the airport by himself, so I picked him up and then he.  I was always pretty good.  If there was a check involved, I showed up everything. 
[03:25:30]  You got your shit together, right?  Yeah.  I never promised what shape I would be in, but I never didn't get paid.  I'm not adding that he caught, like, you made a, you had a fire in the club.  I'm not even adding that.  Like, he's never getting booked at that club again.  What do you mean?  Why?  He did a fire trick.  It was just one of my stunts where I light, light, light, light.  In the club.  I light myself on fire and blow a fire.  This is like a black party, like, you know, people popping bottles and then Steve-O wants to start a fire.  Did they love Steve-O's show?  Yeah, they loved it, but the promoter was running when the fireman came and all that shit, but I don't think he remembers that, though. 
[03:26:00]  Do black crowds like Steve-O?  I imagine they would think he is.  They love him.  They would love him.  They love him.  They can't, y'all, he walks in, like, the clubs and they're just like, what the fuck?  Like, Steve-O, yeah.  Everybody recognizes him?  People are melting, like, yeah.  It's like mad black ooze everywhere, like, yeah.  It's crazy.  They love him, though.  I don't know.  They just can't understand that he's in front of them because he's bigger than life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think, I remember back in the, you know, the mixtape days, because that was the reason why I first met Who Kid, was because he was doing a G-Unit mixtape, and it was called the Wild Boy Mixtape. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  You know, like with Wild Now or something.  I had his old crew, Bam.  I had everybody on the time.  Now he was drops.  Everybody.  It was the Wild Boy Mixtape.  She said, we ought to get the Wild Boy.  So I didn't even know anything about it, and I just heard about it.  Do I want to be on a G-Unit mixtape?  I'm like, sure.  Who could have no expectations?  I mean, just, like, to get Steve-O and be like, hey, I'm Steve-O, and this is the Wild Boy Mixtape.  Right, right.  But I walk in there, right, and I just start popping off, you know.  I tricked him to beef with all our enemies. 
[03:27:00]  It wasn't even a trick.  It wasn't even a trick.  I knew you'd just say this right here.  It wasn't a trick.  I said, who do you guys have beef with?  And it was like, oh, you know, like, Joey Button.  And I was like, oh.  I'm like, oh, fuck that guy.  You know, he's like, I'm just, I'm just like, I don't even know who I'm talking about.  He's telling me, like, I'm just like, oh, this is how he's a bitch.  I'll kick his ass.  And I'm like, just threatening the lives of all these scary rap people.  Talking about, fucking talking about, I'm a white nigger. 
[03:27:30]  I was like, you need to read this right now.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I was just offering it up.  And I remember, like, I had this, like, this genuinely shady manager at the time.  Because it was early on.  Nobody cared about me.  And I had this, like, rave promoter from Cleveland.  And he was, like, a pretty, like, serious, street smart dude.  I remember he's on the other side of the glass from the booth. 
[03:28:00]  And I start saying I'm a nigger.  You know, with who kid?  And I just remember this rave promoter manager guy, his face just turned white.  Jesus, I was just like, really, he had the fucking fear of God.  He melted, too.  He's like, ooh.  Then I started talking about, I'm going to kill this scary person.  Fuck that scary person.  It was pretty wild.  It definitely, uh, I had a great relationship with the G-Unit after that.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds like, how many times after that do you have to go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 
[03:28:30]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Very good question.  Oh, that's funny, man.  You were embarrassed in the moment when it was happening, even though you were drunk?  Or was it afterwards?  Oh, at the, uh, at the, the Wu-Tang thing?  When you Rayquan choked you, yeah.  It was very embarrassing right away.  Right away?  Yeah, it was embarrassing right away.  Dude, hearing the story, it sounds like it would be embarrassing right away.  Because it was, it was such, like, uh, you know, the moment, it had, like, a good vibe to it. 
[03:29:00]  I kind of felt like, oh, you know, we're all on the, like, it was cool.  It was cool, you know, like, everybody was laughing.  I felt like it went really well.  And then that was kind of like, you know, it was kind of like giving back the Heisman  trophy or something.  Giving back.  Oh, man.  I was being stripped of a medal.  You know?  You know?  I'm good.  I'm kind of let down.  Yeah, I felt like a disgrace.  They're up there watching two more tunes, so you're like, God, that went fucking good.  Yeah, like, I'm part of the crew.  Yeah, I felt part of.  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, I was stripped of that.  And then, fuck it.  Then he tested for roids.  That big fucking hand on your throat. 
[03:29:30]  Is he a big dude?  Yeah, he's huge.  Yeah, Ray Kwan's, he's a real pit bull, huh?  Yeah, he's like, yeah, literally.  Yeah, he's described in the right way.  Pit bull.  To be the badass in Wu-Tang.  That's pretty impressive.  He's called Ray Kwan the chef.  The chef.  Yeah, he's a cook coke and niggas.  He cooked the shit out of you, man.  I'm talking, man.  You're lucky you lived, man.  Holy shit.  How do you spell his name?  I don't even know what he looks like.  That is lucky.  It's R-A-E-K-W-O-N. 
[03:30:00]  Okay.  The chef.  They're from Staten Island.  I know those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Murderers.  Can you get me in touch with him, man?  I would love to.  I could do that, yeah.  I would love to talk to him.  I got a cell number.  We'd call him.  It'd be funny if he just choked you right off the bat again.  Yeah.  I thought I told you, motherfucker.  Right.  Shit.  You think he'd talk to Steve-O?  What a wild-ass story, man.  That's fucking crazy.  That was years ago.  Like, I mean, it's with utmost honesty that I'm telling the story, and, you know, it is 
[03:30:30]  what it is, dude.  It's a cool fucking story.  Don't deny it.  It's a cool fucking story.  It's a cool fucking story.  You got choked by a member of Wu-Tang at the wake of another member of Wu-Tang?  We're never going to beat that.  And the reason why is even better.  Oh, my God.  Fuck yeah.  Swinging his balls.  I got to say, though, I landed that double-back-back flip perfectly.  I mean, it was a perfect fucking time.  You were proud.  You were proud.  I'm lucky.  Lucky for you.  This is him, right? 
[03:31:00]  This is the guy?  Yeah.  Very evil guy, man.  Is he?  Still?  The chef.  The cook.  You know what I'm saying?  Rizzo was a nice guy, though.  He seemed nice enough.  He's a cool guy, yeah.  But he's white now.  But Rick Conn is like, he's still a nigga, man.  That's the nigga.  He never went white.  Throw you in the pot, man.  It's over.  You know what I'm saying?  Some weird shit right there.  Let's be nice to him.  What's up with Lindsay Lohan?  You always protect her.  You still protect her?  Fuck, man.  Since I got sober, I haven't heard from her.  You used to protect her.  That was your bitch, man.  What are you talking about? 
[03:31:30]  I don't know if I used to protect her, but she was always cool with me.  Paparazzi.  You were beating up paparazzi for her one time.  You wanted?  That was Paris Hilton.  Oh.  Yeah.  So Paris Hilton, too?  Did you get her new record?  Well, no, but I heard about her.  Sam loves it, man.  Sam.  Lil Wayne.  Yo.  I don't know what's wrong.  White people like this.  Wait, there's too much going on here.  What's going on?  No, I want to know the Lindsay Lohan stuff.  Well, was it Lindsay Lohan?  Did you used to party with her?  Yeah, we partied a bunch of times.  Did we?  There was a...  You know some shit, right?  Yeah, I had her over in my apartment at one point. 
[03:32:00]  And I was working on this video project where it was like me inundating celebrities with  my stunts and antics, you know?  I went everywhere with a video camera, and I had 50 Cent launch me down all these stairs  at the Palms Casino in a bellhop cart, and he did it three times in a row.  So that was fucking fucked up.  Did you get hurt?  No, that one I didn't.  But then I tried to reenact that stunt for Jackass No. 2, and I was out for half the fucking  movie with a back injury.  Holy shit.  But yeah, so anyway, so I'm trying to film celebrities all the time. 
[03:32:30]  I get Lindsay Lohan over to my apartment, and we're just visibly fucked up, you know?  So she's on my sofa, and I just kind of pull out my camera, and I'm filming myself, and  I go, I said, well, you know, man, you better not fuck with Lindsay Lohan, because if you  do, I'll tell someone to kick your ass.  You know, whatever.  And then I pan over, and I pan over, and there she is, and I saw, so it was like a  reveal.  Right.  And she's like, oh my god, I can't believe you're filming me, you know? 
[03:33:00]  And so I had this video footage.  Well, a couple months went by, and she was actually wound up in rehab, you know?  And I'm in my bathroom, and I look under, there was a counter, and the top of the upper  tank of the toilet is hidden under the camera, or under the counter.  And at some point, I don't know why, but I looked under, I was probably looking for  drugs, I look at her, I see this fucking wallet.  Turns out she had left her fucking wallet in my bathroom for like two fucking months.  Right?  Her wallet was in my bathroom for like two fucking months. 
[03:33:30]  So here's what I do, I got this fucking video footage, right?  I fucking call her up, I'm like, hey, I just found your wallet in my bathroom.  Right?  And she's like, oh, thank god.  I'm like, she's like, bring it over to the rehab.  So I go over to this fucking rehab, and I make her sign a release for him.  For the video footage.  I mean, I wouldn't give her a wallet unless she signed on.  Oh, man.  I signed so that I could use her fucking video footage.  Holy shit.  What a shit in.  Did you use it? 
[03:34:00]  I never put out that project, you know?  When you walked up to the rehab, did they hit an alarm like fucking, like a submarine going  down?  Mah!  Mah!  Like, get extra people in here.  Steve-O's coming.  It wasn't like that.  It was, she was out shopping for the day, and I met her at the gate as she drove back  into the room.  What kind of rehab let you go shopping for the day?  I don't know.  I don't think it took. 
[03:34:30]  Was she pissed that you were?  She wasn't pissed, and she wrote, she signed her name, like, really beautifully.  Nice.  You know?  You get a little action?  I got Paris, no, no.  You didn't get anything off her?  No, I got Paris Hilton to sign a release for him at her house at a party.  She invited me to.  We whipped it out.  She invited me to her apartment, her living room, and I whip out of there.  Hey, will you sign this?  Who's the most famous girl you ever fucked?  Oh, I don't know.  He's probably not going to say.  But there has been, right?  Um.  Someone?  Wow, we just shut Steve-O off. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  That's what it takes to shut him up.  Ixnay, honey.  We didn't have a good time with Paris.  You never fucked Precious, did you?  You never fucked Precious?  Yeah, you never fucked Precious?  I don't think you did, though.  Fucking Precious.  Yeah, that's what we should be asking, though.  The worst one.  What was the worst one?  You didn't have a good time in Paris?  No, no, no.  With Paris.  Wait, when she came in here?  Yeah, yeah.  She's terrible.  We did not hit it off with her, unfortunately.  Oh, yeah.  She didn't really.  And we tried.  When was it, though? 
[03:35:30]  When was it?  Not long ago.  I gave her a bit of a talking to her, and I wasn't that brutal to her because she wasn't  being mean.  She was just being very not revealing and standoffish.  It was when she was doing the reality show.  She's being a loser.  We were on our best behavior, Steve.  We were really nice to her.  We were on the reality show, the one that didn't do very well.  Yeah, recently.  Well, I mean, you got to understand.  She needed a little help there.  We didn't even ask a bad question.  No, not at all.  That set her off.  And nobody was trying to be shitty to her.  We really weren't.  Like, we've been shitty to people.  You got to figure that, you know, like, here's how it is, man.  And you know those fucking things where the four balls are hanging, you know, you pull 
[03:36:00]  back one ball, and it's like three balls down and it shoots off.  She had something else bothering her.  Yeah.  And it was just you guys that came out.  Oh, we were the...  You know what?  Fucking...  That's accurate.  I could see that that was the deal that day.  You know, I mean, she probably wasn't in a good mood, you know?  Yeah.  We could have helped her out, too, man.  Believe it or not.  I mean, think of it this way, man.  We could have made that show a little more interesting than it was.  Think of it this way.  Kim Kardashian used to be...  Fucking hate her.  She used to be fucking, like, Paris Hilton's, like, assistant or something.  Right.  Yeah.  Kim Kardashian used to organize Paris Hilton's closet for her. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, man.  Is that what she did?  Yeah.  That was, like, among her duties.  And they don't talk anymore, right?  No, no, no.  Because Kim became the thing.  Right.  So, I mean...  She pushed Paris Hilton right out of the way.  It's great.  It's pretty unbelievable.  Wow.  I didn't know she did that.  Oh, yeah.  There's a cunt world out there.  Paris...  I know a little bit about this.  Paris Hilton...  I couldn't believe it.  Paris Hilton was the one that introduced Kim Kardashian to the world.  Yeah.  And the paparazzi...  Was that Ray J the one who introduced...  Well... 
[03:37:00]  That's that nigga.  She started hanging out with Paris Hilton, and the paparazzi were like, well, fuck this.  Who's this broad?  Why doesn't she help Paris now?  If Paris was nicer, would she have helped her out?  Or like, why didn't she...  I don't think Paris Hilton needs the help, really, right?  She's a DJ now.  Yeah, she's doing it all.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  Remember, she runs all those businesses.  She's a businesswoman.  Remember, Jimmy?  She does.  Sure.  Yeah, I mean, she's doing all right.  But I just think...  She sat here like this.  She goes, I run businesses now. 
[03:37:30]  I don't need to...  She's bad.  Yeah, she really was not pleasant.  And I was trying really hard to be nice to her.  We did try.  Speak.  By the way, it's not...  They're saying you have to do live radio.  Yeah, they're saying you have to do live radio.  All right, cool, man.  Well, hey, dude, it's a fucking pleasure to be here, guys.  And let's plug the show again.  It's on...  True TV.  Friday nights on True TV.  I saw one.  It was good.  9 p.m.  9 o'clock on True TV.  Steve-O was having a good time with the whole fucking thing.  Yeah, you're doing great, man.  We're happy for you.  Thanks so much.  We're really happy.  Good to see you, Jim, dude.  You too, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I guess we're done, huh?  Yes, and Who Kid, thank you.  Who Kid, what the fuck, man?  Definitely.  Who Kid, always a fucking pisser. 
[03:38:00]  Who Kid with his fucking huge cock?  Is he really packing Who Kid?  He's got a huge cock.  Oh, you missed that part of his door?  How big is it there, Who Kid?  Down there?  What are you packing?  A water bottle?  What do you got?  I don't know.  I didn't see it this morning, but it kind of grew a little more.  I'm like 14.  Be careful, this kid.  I know.  With his fucking condoms.  Get my dick out of here.  Crazy person.  All right, we're out of here.  All right.  Later.  Thanks, guys.  Sure, man.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.
