<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts returning from an unexpectedly extended Christmas break, stemming from a staff scheduling error that announced their return as January 4th, 2000, instead of April 9th, 2001.  Opie recounted his scuba diving vacation in Turks and Caicos, highlighting a physical altercation with a French diver he punched underwater after repeated collisions.  Numerous callers shared their own negative experiences with inconsiderate divers and expressed general anti-French sentiment. Anthony detailed his near-miss making his flight to Puerto Rico for a Club Med cruise, recounting a reckless drive across the Belt Parkway median to reach JFK. He also shared amusing anecdotes from the cruise, speculating on the captain’s actual duties.

The show transitioned to Opie's story about his brother's mud-tracking antics on a highway divider.  This segued into a discussion about cruise ship experiences, including Opie's observation of passengers being winched onto a departing ship amidst angry shouts. A caller, Mark, shared a similar experience of being left behind and having to take a dangerous pilot boat ride.  Another caller, Mark, questioned the effectiveness of cruise ship safety drills. This led to a humorous hypothetical scenario of a real emergency on a cruise ship.  The segment featured a live remote with "Black" Earl from Shea Stadium, interspersed with Mets game updates and commentary on Bob Murphy's announcing style.  A significant portion of this segment involved a phone call with comedian Carlos Mencia.  Their conversation focused on ethnic stereotypes concerning Italians, Mexicans, African-Americans, and other groups, with Mencia sharing jokes and audience reactions.  The conversation also extensively covered *The Sopranos*, including a lawsuit against the show and its portrayal of various ethnic groups.  A caller identified himself as Meadow Soprano's brother, leading to a discussion of a specific scene from the show.  Other listeners called in to share their perspectives on ethnic stereotypes and cruise ship experiences.  Studio guests included Dan and AJ, with Earl remote from Shea Stadium.

The show continued with Opie revisiting his underwater fistfight with the French diver, sparking a discussion about hatred and the acceptability of disliking people of other races. This led to anecdotes about bad service at fast food restaurants and perceived racial dynamics in customer complaints.  Carlos Mencia called in again. A caller, Terry from Harlem, labeled Mencia a "sellout," prompting a debate about race relations and American history, referencing the Declaration of Independence and African-American experiences. Mencia defended his position, highlighting America's progress despite past injustices.  The discussion touched on crime statistics and the complexities of racial prejudice.  The hosts then criticized the excessive number of station promos, particularly those for "Radio Chick" and "Don and Mike," speculating on inter-show rivalries and station management decisions. Shahid, a staff member, joined the conversation, expressing frustration with scheduling conflicts during Opie and Anthony's vacation.  This sparked a back-and-forth with callers supporting and criticizing Don and Mike.  The conversation then shifted to a bizarre story about a homeless man contaminating buffet food with feces and urine in various New York City establishments, leading to a crude debate about which bodily fluid would be least objectionable in food.  Andrew Dice Clay was mentioned as an upcoming guest.

The final segment started with a discussion about the purported health benefits of urine, followed by a ranking game of the "worst" bodily functions: male and female feces, urine, and snot.  Kelly Ripa was briefly mentioned, and a listener suggested adding "colostomy bag juice."  The show then returned to the homeless man incident and the fallout with another radio show, with Opie and Anthony expressing frustration with station management’s attempts to censor their responses.  They repeatedly tried to address this censorship while being interrupted by music and production staff.  The hosts promoted Planet Java iced coffee, followed by listener calls playing "What Did We Learn Today?", featuring crude and offensive jokes. The segment included a critique of the movie *Joe Dirt*, focusing on the main character's mullet, and a discussion of the *Blow* movie promo, utilizing vulgar language.  The show concluded by giving away "blow prize packs."  Throughout this segment, significant amounts of vulgar and offensive language were used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony.  They act like a-hole braggers.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, we are the best.  1027.  Now stop it!  Don't trial this.  WNEW.  Take your balls and kick it off now!  Yeah, thank you.  Look what I did to you.  Again!  I can't imagine. 
[00:00:30]  I got- I got thought of a kind of brain.  Time to be dead.  I see your legs coming.  Shut up, bitch!  That's funny!  Are you ready?  Wow!  Wow! 
[00:01:00]  That's a winner!  Ow!  Oh!  Well, looky, looky here. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Yes, good morning, Arnold.  Good afternoon.  How are you?  I'm doing good, Arnold.  Now we're having fun.  Yes, we are.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  It's the O&A Show.  We are live back from vacation.  On this first day of winter.  I'm teasing.  Kidding, of course.  Just getting back from our Christmas break.  Had a little problem. 
[00:02:00]  Should have been back three or four days.  Anyone else getting deja vu?  Yeah.  No, it's Monday, April 9th, because people don't know when we're live or on tape anymore.  Yes.  Because we put together such a great best-of show.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's so funny, because Ben was running the board all last week, and Stinky and Rick, and  the phones are ringing like crazy, like we're here, and they want to talk about their stepfathers,  and they want to talk about their fetishes, and this and that, and it amazes Ben and Rick 
[00:02:30]  and Stinky every time.  People think we're still here.  Goddamn right off the bat, Dan from Hoboken.  You guys are back, but Stinky didn't come on and announce it's April 9th, 2000.  Hey, that's good.  Very good.  All right, everyone relax.  It's Stinky, January 4th, 2000.  O&A will be back live in five minutes.  That's Stinky.  We gave him one job.  Yeah.  We got to explain. 
[00:03:00]  Like, when we went away for Christmas, we were supposed to be back, and then we ran into  some problems.  A couple of difficulties because of the show prior to our vacation.  So all of a sudden, we had to take another three days off, unexpectedly.  Yeah, and no one really knew when we were coming back.  Right, so we finally go, Stinky, just go in there and tell them the date so they know  that we will be live that day.  And he missed it by a year.  By 365-some-odd days, yes.  I want to play that again.  What happened? 
[00:03:30]  No, I didn't play it.  Oh, yeah.  No surprise.  Took 11 days off.  They still don't work.  Only took a couple of minutes.  All right, everyone relax.  It's Stinky.  January 4th, 2000.  O&A will be back.  What happened now?  It keeps going out.  It doesn't work.  That's all right.  That's all right.  We were on vacation.  Well, Pete, the engineer, is now a radio star, so he doesn't have to bother with the equipment. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, that must have been it.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Oh, we got lots of stuff to talk about today.  Yes.  We've been paying attention.  Don't worry.  We'll get to all of it.  We may have been away, but we keep tabs on what happened.  Because we have thousands upon thousands of spies out there.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Where's the weed?  Come on.  Anthony, what's going on?  Not too much.  I had a great time on vacation.  How was yours?  I'm sorry, Anthony.  Go ahead.  That's all right.  I mean, you guys got a great show. 
[00:04:30]  You've got so many great bits.  But why is it on Saturday I get the best of, best of?  The best of?  You play the same stuff Saturday that you play throughout the whole week.  Well, because we were running out of stuff.  You can't run out of stuff.  Not you guys.  We had to fill up like seven days of shows.  No, you guys got plenty of stuff.  I can't.  I don't want to hear Patty again.  Jesus.  I know I'm done.  Well, you know, we're here for hopefully a few more months before we have to take a break.  I understand that.  But Jesus.  I'm going to play something different.  Get some classic stuff and be playing Patty again. 
[00:05:00]  Be nice to Patty.  She's over there in China with the airmen.  Did you see that one chick?  That looks exactly like that.  And then she went to the other one.  God damn.  Don't give her back.  Yeah, we have to get into that situation.  No, what I was going to say is we'll be live.  And then I was doing some math in my head.  Yeah.  We'll be live for either the next three months or the next two.  Right.  Right.  Still working that whole thing out. 
[00:05:30]  So I think we'll be here at least live for two more months.  And then it's anyone's guess after that.  Yeah.  What happens?  Even ours.  Yeah.  We don't know.  A lot of rumors out there.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  More budding journalists printing their sources and information on various message boards.  One guy so accurate it scared the hell out of me.  What?  I thought it was our agent.  Made the post.  I think someone was tapping my phone.  I thought our agent posted for a second. 
[00:06:00]  Now you're going to wonder which one because there's a lot of them out there.  Yeah.  But there was one that was like, oh, my God.  Wow.  Maybe I should get rid of my cordless phone.  Who posted that one?  Anyway, we're back.  Yeah.  Monday, April 9th, 2001.  Yeah.  We should do a vacation break.  Tell everyone what we did.  Went on separate vacations.  Yes.  Yes.  And did the cruise thing.  I went on the cruise.  And I did the Club Med thing.  Mm-hmm.  Down in Turks and Caicos. 
[00:06:30]  A great spot.  Because Opie's into scuba diving.  Oh, you want me to tell that story right off the bat?  You're a big scuba diver now.  Dude, why do you still have that on your arm?  I don't know.  You just want to wear it to let people know you were on vacation?  No, I kind of forgot.  I mean, give me a...  You forgot?  When did you get back?  Yesterday at 3.30 in the morning.  So you had that on in bed?  Well, when you go to club...  People that go to Club Med understand.  They give you bracelets so that they know that, you know, you're at the resort.  Yeah.  It looks like, you know, you've been out to a bar. 
[00:07:00]  You've got that little thing around.  So now you wake up.  No.  You go to take a shower.  It's been on for like nine days.  So you just forget that it's there.  Swear to God.  Okay.  Give me a scissor.  I don't care.  Look.  I don't care.  I mean, you're going to make...  Look.  Just gone.  Vacation over.  Oh, that's what it is.  Okay.  I got you.  Damn.  Now vacation's over.  Now it's officially over.  Now we've got to perform.  Mine was over at 3 o'clock when I stopped drinking.  Which is hard to do.  Especially in vacation mode.  Well, I can tell... 
[00:07:30]  There's a couple stories I want to tell from my vacation.  Yeah, because now you're into scuba diving.  Anthony was cracking me up.  He's got some stories to tell from his vacation.  So we'll get into that.  All right.  I'll tell the scuba diving one.  Turks and Caicos.  This is going to help the psycho factor in my head bit.  I can't believe you.  Yeah, I went to Turks and Caicos because I wanted to do some diving.  I dove all week.  I'm a beginner diver.  I only have about 10 dives under my belt.  So I'm not going to act like I'm Jacques Cousteau or anything. 
[00:08:00]  I had to go diving with...  What, dead?  Yeah.  I'm no Jacques Cousteau.  I breathe.  So, one day...  I just want to start this little story by saying French people suck.  Ah.  Hate them.  It's very international when you go away like that.  A lot of people from a lot of countries.  And they should talk their girlfriends into shaving their armpits.  That's acceptable here.  That's what you want to see on a Club Med vacation.  French girls with big, gnarly, sweaty, black underarm hair. 
[00:08:30]  Man, that's attractive.  And there you can only imagine, if that looks like that, what is...  Whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of a stretch when you see, like, you know, a girl, she's a freshman  in college, she's going for that whole hippie thing, and the rest of her body's hot, and  all of a sudden she reaches up to grab the Frisbee or something, and you see the hair.  You can almost, and I'm just, I'm saying almost, almost.  It's still tough, but you can almost see through that.  But as soon as they're a little overweight, or a little older, or French, or French, it's 
[00:09:00]  just flat out disgusting.  You don't want the hair under there.  No.  No.  Well, this girl, I mean, a side story to what I'm about to say, she was in one of the shows  they do at Club Med.  They get all of the people that are down there on vacation, and some of them want to participate  in the shows.  Right.  Well, so they put together a little stage show.  Well, the fat French lady with the underarm hair was in one of the skits where she had  to raise her hands a lot.  The whole audience laughing uncontrollably. 
[00:09:30]  At her hairy armpits.  At her hairy armpits.  And she doesn't understand it, because I guess in France it's okay.  It's fine.  But you know something?  If you're going to go on vacation where there's not, everybody isn't from France, maybe you  ought to just assimilate a little bit.  Trim it up.  Anyway, I had a problem with this couple pretty much the whole time.  A French couple.  A French couple, and they didn't speak English.  So I go diving.  This was like midweek.  And this is kind of a good story. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  So I start my descent to the bottom of the ocean.  To the bottom of the ocean, Opie.  Well, they only take you 60 feet, but that is the bottom where we're going.  Bottom of that part of the ocean.  Sure.  And then you get to go over some ridges and stuff where it's a little deeper, but whatever.  So you're with a guide.  Now, I've done about nine or ten dives, like I said, so it was quicker for me to get to  the bottom than, like, the guys that are doing their first or second dive.  Okay?  Feeling more comfortable.  Feeling a little comfortable.  So I'm at the bottom of the ocean waiting for my fellow divers, because you've got to 
[00:10:30]  dive in a group.  Bottom of the ocean.  Because I'm not really certified.  Yeah, 60.  Got your tanks on.  You're looking good.  Yes.  All right.  And I'm just looking around.  I'd like to fish and stuff.  Go, all right, cool.  I can't wait to start to die.  Here comes the French guy.  What is this, a group-up point or something?  You all descend to the bottom of the ocean.  Well, I mean, if you want to get technical, you've got to descend to the 15-foot bar for  a while.  Hang out there, and then you drop from there.  But eventually, you're on the bottom of the ocean.  Yeah.  As soon as I said drop from the bar, it took me, whatever, ten seconds to get to the bottom 
[00:11:00]  more or less, through a little equalizing, and you're down there ready to go.  So I'm at the bottom, 60 feet under, and here comes the French guy.  That doesn't speak English, that has the girlfriend with the hairy armpits that I just hated from  the first day I saw him at the club.  And now he's new, because you've got to go through the whole orientation thing?  Without a doubt, this guy was probably making his first dive.  Uh-huh.  Maybe second tops.  Mm-hmm.  So he starts coming down, and I look above, and I'm like, hello, I'm right here. 
[00:11:30]  Where was he looking?  He wasn't looking.  That's the problem.  Okay.  So I look up, and I'm like, the son of a bitch is heading right for me.  Coming right for us!  That's right.  And do I have the clip of Opie somewhere?  I think I do.  Here's Opie on the bottom of the ocean.  Right.  It's coming right for us!  Oh, wow.  But see, this is how twisted my head is.  Yeah, thanks, dude.  Yeah, exactly.  So I obviously could have probably moved and let him just land softly. 
[00:12:00]  On the bottom of the ocean, yes.  To where I was.  But I wanted to see where this was going to go.  Mm-hmm.  So I look up, and I'm like, he's getting closer, he's getting closer.  Is he going to move?  Is he going to move?  He doesn't move.  His fin pretty much takes out the left side of my face.  Hard.  Boom!  So his fin, he kicks you.  Yeah.  In the side of the head.  Yeah.  Now, does your regulator move or something?  No, no, no.  No, thank God.  You're under there.  No, because that would have been a whole different problem.  Mm-hmm.  Then we would have taken it on land. 
[00:12:30]  That's what I'm going to say.  We would have.  Okay?  Usually, you'd take it down to street level.  Okay.  We would have taken it on land.  On land.  You'll understand in a minute.  So he kicks you in the face.  Yeah, pretty much the left side of my forehead here.  It was like, it was enough.  Did the mask come loose?  Did anything like that?  Right on the side of the head.  Right on the side of the head, mostly.  It came down like this, okay?  Ah.  All right, so I'm like, look at that.  And I'm a little pissed.  Let me get this straight.  A French guy went down on Opie.  No, no, you don't. 
[00:13:00]  House from Flanders, New Jersey.  Listen to the rest of the story.  Yeah.  So he hits me.  But, see, his legs were flailing as he's going down to the bottom.  So that, to me, was like, okay, he's a beginner.  I'll give him a little slack.  Right, he's freaking a little.  But, boom, Finn hits me on the left side of the head.  He continues his descent.  Now he's basically, here comes the jokes, but he's basically on top of me.  All right.  His tank now nails my hip.  Now he's coming down.  He's still coming down.  He's still coming down.  Now the heavy tank nails me on the side. 
[00:13:30]  And if you don't believe me, I mean, I could show you a bruise, but everyone's going to call me a fag for pulling my pants down.  But trust me, it's there.  All right.  But if you need to see it, I'll, you know, I'll carefully show you the bruise.  Really bad.  So, hold on to your seats, kids.  You're Palo.  At this point, I give him the, I don't give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm just waiting for, like, a look of, wow, you know, I'm sorry.  I'm out of my mind.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But he's French.  Except my apology.  Yeah, but it doesn't matter what language you speak. 
[00:14:00]  You can look at a guy, and you can give him something with your facial reaction.  So you're still willing to play this off as he's a beginner.  But I'm heated.  Now you're pissed.  I'm heated.  On the bottom of the ocean.  He looks at me.  We're 60 feet under, okay?  Right.  He looks at me, and he doesn't give me anything.  Nothing.  You know when someone cuts you off and does a stupid move on the road, but you can almost see through it if they kind of give you that look like, I know I screwed up.  I'm really sorry.  Please forgive me.  You're still a little pissed, but at least they acknowledged it. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  The guy didn't acknowledge it, and that really pissed me off.  Yeah.  So I punched him in the head.  You punch the French guy in the head.  Now, you're on the bottom of the ocean, 60 feet under.  I start a fight with a French guy.  What is wrong with you?  What is wrong with you?  Every year I have to punch someone in the head, because I was just thinking.  Like, it's been a year since I popped Paul in the head in the studio. 
[00:15:00]  Paul Vaughn.  Wouldn't that have been funny if it was actually Paul Vaughn diving down, and Opie punched him in the head.  Now, where did you hit him?  Right on the side of the head.  All right.  In the side of the head.  You made sure you didn't hit his regulator or his mask.  I was just going for the headshot.  Or you didn't even care.  You just happened to land on the side.  No, I didn't care.  No, because the rest of the body is pretty much protected with the vest and the tanks, and you've got a wetsuit on, you know.  So I pop him on the side of the head.  Now, you're sitting there like, oh, my God, you know, wow, you're so brave and stuff. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, obviously it was a slow motion fight, because we're 60 feet under the water.  You can't really get a good punch flying underwater.  Even James Bond had difficulty in the movie.  I couldn't get my weight behind the punch.  Why?  It was just kind of, but it made me feel good.  Now, were you standing up at this point?  Sort of, yeah.  Your feet are kind of touching the sand at the bottom of the ocean.  I was probably just above the sand.  Oh, right.  He wants to stay off the bottom, man.  Right.  And away from the coral and stuff. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  So, yeah, it was like a $6 million man fight in slow motion.  I punch him in the side of the head, the French guy.  He proceeds to push me.  Now you're getting into, you're into, you're throwing down.  Yeah.  You're throwing down.  60 feet under water with a Frenchie.  Which, quite frankly, is, you know, kind of scary.  Like I said, I'm only 10 dives into my little diving gear.  So, it's still a little.  And he's fighting.  I'm fighting.  You can't fight underwater like that. 
[00:16:30]  So, he pushes me, but, you know, obviously the...  Now, if you're on land...  Aquaman.  If you're on land, every fight starts with a couple punches, maybe a couple pushes,  and then you get down into, hopefully, wrestling and throwing someone down on the ground, right?  So, how will Aquaman handle this?  So, my instincts take over.  I'm like, all right, well, I got to fight now.  Sorry.  No matter where you are.  I attempt to tackle 60 feet under water.  So, now what?  Bring me through it.  How did you go to tackle? 
[00:17:00]  I just kind of went forward.  You went forward, of course.  And, you know, I tried to grab him and knock him down, realizing it just wasn't going to work.  At this point, the guide had to break this up.  He's breaking up a fight 60 feet underwater.  Yes.  Aquaman then whistled for a seahorse and rode off.  Now, I don't think the guide saw everything that was going on.  Oh, the rest of the people in our group, definitely.  They were watching, placing some bets. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'd have been like, this is the coolest thing I'll ever see underwater.  I don't care if a goddamn mermaid swims by right now.  This is a brawl.  Wait, this guy's got a similar story.  A fight.  I thought this was quite unique.  Jesus.  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Did you have a good vacation?  It was great.  Oh, kicking ass underwater.  Had something similarly happen to me in Cancun.  Yeah.  The guy, instead of, like, hitting me with the flapper, threw me like an elbow shiv right 
[00:18:00]  to the head.  Yeah.  So, instead of, like, retaliating that way with fists, I just ripped the dude's oxygen  right off his dude almost drowned.  Now, that, I think, could be attempted murder.  Like him, dude.  I ain't taking a shot to the nose.  My nose, I'm bleeding underwater.  I'm, like, foggy.  For two days, I was, like, duh.  You know, and I think this type of thing happens more often than you think, because the dive  guy, the guy that goes with you, he wants his group close together, because he's got  to, you know, watch you. 
[00:18:30]  Got to watch everybody.  And, you know, some of these guys, when they're doing their first or second, I'm going to say  it again, I'm only ten dives in, but I feel a little more comfortable under the water.  I mean, their arms and stuff are flailing.  They're freaking out, because it's the first time they're underwater.  Hey, oh, one more quickie?  No.  Dude, for revenge, did you get to play Guess What's Under Her Pits?  No.  Who is she sporting?  Pool rack?  I'm not kidding, man.  I mean, just...  Dude, I hear you, man.  That is nasty.  Not just a little bit, just full underarm hair, but thank you, Tony.  Must have the poodle in the pouch there.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  I'll be, um, Will from Staten Island checking in.  You're breaking the rules.  He said, uh, the first rule of underwater fight club is you don't talk about underwater fight  club.  Underwater fight club.  Tyler Durden.  It was great, though.  Oh, get me wrong.  I'm going to talk to you on my feet.  Oh, dear.  You're going to talk straight.  What is your problem? 
[00:19:30]  Hey, Greg, what's up?  Greg.  Okay.  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to know if your hip is as bad as the intern's stitches.  Ah, all right.  You calling me out?  I'll show my hip.  Oh, unbelievable.  Now I got to show it.  Underwater fight club.  So then, yeah, then the guy, you know, he broke us up and we went on our dive.  I'm convinced he didn't see the whole thing because I think he would have brought us all  back to the top.  And then the rest of the dive, any time he got close to me, I just kind of pushed the  ball.  Well, I would stay away from you at that point, thinking you were a complete lunatic. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Who fights underwater?  Now, every contact the guy made with you, Opie, was accidental.  Holy smoke.  Just in case you thought I was killed.  What happened there?  That's where the tank hit you?  You thought I was killed?  He came down hard, huh?  Yeah.  Because he dropped.  Like a rock.  Now, everything he did was accidental.  Careless, stupid, but it wasn't intentional.  Every contact you made with him was intentionally to hurt this gentleman. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, I snapped.  No, no, no, no.  I'm still on him.  No, because there was a bunch of other things I could have done.  Turn off his air hose.  That would have freaked him out a little bit.  Jesus Christ.  Did you take into consideration where you were when you decided then you were going to  tackle this guy?  And I can't believe he is tackling me.  Let me do this lunatic.  Let me make it perfectly clear.  It looked completely ridiculous.  You're right.  Yeah.  Nothing got done.  There was no, you know, no one really getting hurt.  It's just the fact that I snapped 60 feet under the water and punched a guy. 
[00:21:00]  It's probably like hitting him with, like, marshmallows or something, but yeah, you can't  really get a punch going.  So then the rest of the time, I would just give this guy the dirtiest looks around the  resort.  And he just acted like, you know, his ass didn't stink.  Well, he's probably right now on some French radio show going, and I just kicked his ass.  I punched him so hard, he got their bleeds.  Wait, Maria can relate to this. 
[00:21:30]  Let's go to Maria.  Maria, what's up?  Opie, I can agree with you on both points.  First of all, I know it's not politically correct, but I think the French are some of the most  arrogant people I've ever met.  Hey, hey.  And you see them at Club Med all the time because it's French run.  Yeah.  And there's always one jackass that doesn't listen to anything the dive master says when  they're told.  Well, you know, I asked the people at Club Med because, you know, they see people from  all over the world.  And let me tell you, New Yorkers can be quite obnoxious at these Club Med. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah, we're not completely innocent, but...  So I was curious, and I asked a bunch of people, you know, who are the rudest people that you  come in contact with?  And they said, without a doubt, and I was just praising myself, they were going to say New  Yorkers?  And they said, no, the French.  Oh, absolutely.  And I've traveled in Europe, and I can tell you, anywhere you go, you run into the French,  you're right, they think their ass doesn't stink.  So what happened with you and the dive master there?  Oh, well, you know, we were on a dive, my husband and I both dived, and we had the same 
[00:22:30]  problem with a guy on a descent, and, you know, they don't realize that the more they  flail, the less buoyant they're going to be, and they kick up all the sand on the bottom,  and then you're blind.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, and people, they're just flailing all over the place.  Exactly.  They should take all the beginners out by themselves, but then there would probably be so much  sand in the water, the dive masters wouldn't be able to find them.  I gave the French guy the flipper to the head.  I mean, I just saw the bruise.  Yeah, wow.  I'm sorry I missed that.  I would have paid money to see Underwater Fight Club. 
[00:23:00]  Underwater Fight Club.  Bye, Maria.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Jay Moore Buddy on the instant feedback, also wondering if you pulled any of the Underwater  Matrix moves, because you're kind of suspended there.  You could have done the cool Matrix moves.  Underwater's scared the T out of them.  I go, oh, no, it's Matrix.  No damage was done.  No damage was done.  But it was just the fact that I snapped underwater.  Neo.  It frightened me.  Neo, right.  You know, you could get up, figure on something, and spin around. 
[00:23:30]  In place, looking bad.  Hey, Dave, what's going on?  Oh, I have to ask you, because, you know, I've been on dives before.  What did you do when you got back up to the surface?  See, I wish I had a good end to the story.  Nothing, really.  But it was a big boat with a lot of other divers, and we just kind of avoided each other.  Oh, you're kidding me.  No.  I mean, I got enough pleasure just trying to punch some guy in the face underwater, man.  Congratulations.  All right, Dave.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Good job.  And you couldn't talk to the guy, because, like, I started the story off.  The guy was French. 
[00:24:00]  He didn't speak a word of English.  No.  Rod, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  You remember Top Secret?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember the fight underwater?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, Val Kilmer was there.  Oh, yeah.  Fred sucks, man.  Trust me.  It looked completely ridiculous.  I don't want to sit here and act like a tough guy.  It looked completely...  It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever been involved in.  Scuba fight.  Great.  All right.  How to fight scuba style from Rich and Farseels. 
[00:24:30]  Flood his mask.  While he's blind, release his weight belt.  Swim away.  And enjoy your dive.  Nice.  Because the guy will go right to the surf.  Nice.  That's a really good idea.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  This is the guy that won the Gene Garofalo tickets.  I had that contest about cursing with you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, listen.  I have my faith in God reaffirmed today.  I'm coming...  I got wowed.  I'm coming down the highway.  And I got...  Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
[00:25:00]  Let's thank hers.  Yes.  It was a beautiful day.  Yes, it was a beautiful day.  Thank hers.  It was a beautiful thing.  I'm coming down the highway.  I see a wow sticker on a white SUV.  Pass it, looking.  Girl in her mid-late 20s, looking fine.  Went up ahead.  You know, I know the rules of the game here.  The girl passes me by.  Go in the game, man.  It was over.  There you go.  Shirt all the way up.  Hey, I loved you in any given Sunday.  So I, you know, gave her the thumbs up.  Followed her the rules.  Thumbs up.  The brief second, you know.  Oh, these questions.  You can bury that stuff. 
[00:25:30]  All right, Mike, congratulations.  Okay, hey, when I went to that concert, you guys were right.  Garofalo sucked.  Yeah.  That's all right.  The chaparral was a pisser.  It was hard to hear everything he said.  Cool.  But he was cool.  All right.  Okay, guys, take care.  Bye.  Also, Brian, wondering if you came up looking like Hooper after you saw Ben Gardner's boat.  Let's go to Alan.  Alan, what's up?  Drops the French guy's tooth. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, don't you know frogs are better underwater than you are?  Hey, listen, I had a dive encounter when I was in Barbados.  It's a funny thing.  I was an ex-Navy SEAL.  Spent four years in the service.  Go out on vacation in Barbados.  This dive master tries telling me that I go down to the bottom.  We were in about 80 feet of water.  Go down to the bottom, start exploring around.  Guy starts coming up, tugging at my chest, telling me, you've got to stay together with  the whole crowd. 
[00:26:30]  Push them off, start wandering around, looking at the reef and stuff.  Guy comes over to me again, starts grabbing at my flipper, telling me I've got to get over  there, got to go over here.  Got so mad, the guy pushes me to the floor to sand, standing there.  I turned around, popped his PC, his vest.  Guy went up to the surface, guy went up to the surface like a balloon.  Needless to say, the rest of the two weeks, I wasn't allowed to dive.  Ah, yeah, see, that's another thing.  You might have screwed up the rest of your dives. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, I definitely did.  Yeah, I'm talking to Opie.  And this was midweek, I had a few more dives in me.  Thanks, Alan.  Okay, take care.  Brian checking in, Opie said, at any time during your altercation, were you thinking  how great a story this would be to tell on the radio?  Oh, yeah.  Like, as you're doing it, you're like, I can't believe I'm doing this.  Now I've got to get back.  Well, when I told Sandy what happened, and all I said was, underwater fight, it just was  like, oh, God, this is made for the radio.  Sam, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey. 
[00:27:30]  This is the Frenchman that dropped in on him.  Yeah, right.  I have created a new device called scuba.  Yeah.  Self-contained underwater beating apparatus.  Yeah.  How are you today, gentlemen?  I'm going to go back to France and make fun of the American who cannot fight underwater.  All right, Sam, thank you.  Have a good day.  Bye.  Jacques Cousteau, also a French.  All right, we should take our first break, huh?  Yeah.  You actually started it.  The guy accidentally hits you.  I understand he hurt you.  He hit a hip and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  Why?  But it was his own inexperience and, you know, inconsideration to not say anything.  You threw the first punch in anger.  He never punched me.  He never punched me.  He's underwater.  His first dive, he's probably petrified.  Like a wussy push.  Like a girl, I saw this brown substance oozing from his suit.  So I hit him because he was close to me.  I picked up some fire coral and cut him.  There you go.  It's like sea hunt.  It's like an old episode of Sea Hunt. 
[00:28:30]  Get the knife out of your leg and cut his air hose.  I mean, he always did.  Big spear gun.  I didn't understand.  James Bond.  I didn't understand on the boat before we went diving, there was a couple from Quebec.  No, Vancouver.  Close to Vancouver.  And they brought their own diving equipment.  And they were dressed to the nines.  And all of a sudden, they're pulling out knives.  Yeah.  And they want to strap them to their leg.  And the dive master's like, no knives.  Why not?  Now I understand.  Nice fight.  Right.  When you're a jet, you're a... 
[00:29:00]  Here's Opie.  All right.  What a fight club.  You're insane.  All right.  We got to take a quick break, Anthony.  We have just begun.  Anthony's got some great stories, too.  Opie had lifeless eyes, like a doll's eyes.  Are you hearing the music, Opie? 
[00:29:30]  Let's go right back to the phones, Anthony.  What the hell was that?  What the hell was that? 
[00:30:00]  Oh!  Wow, I am getting pounded.  Oh!  Hang on.  Hang on.  So bad!  Not to go off on a tangent, but is that the long version of me ripping the phones out?  The long version. 
[00:30:30]  The other version.  57.  Opie loses ass.  Here's Opie on dry land, losing his effing mind.  I don't even know what...  It says Opie loses ass.  We'll play this as we go to break, and man, we're just getting started.  Oh, yeah.  It's great to be back.  We're well-rested and ready to rock.  Dan the Man is going to be at Shea Stadium after the game, handing out Wow stickers today.  Look at that.  With Earl.  We'll be checking in soon.  That game's not over yet. 
[00:31:00]  Uh-oh.  Someone just hit a home run.  Uh.  Is that Larry?  Uh.  All right.  We'll give you a score in a minute, too.  Check this out.  And let's go right back to the phones, Anthony.  Sarah, what's going on?  Sarah?  Sarah?  Hey, Sarah.  Sarah?  Hey, hey.  Hey, Sarah?  Sarah?  No, no, no, no.  Uh, no.  No, no, this can't...  Uh, no.  No, no, this can't be working. 
[00:31:30]  I think I lost them.  Hey, what do you mean, Sarah?  No, Sarah, you're right there.  Sarah, Sarah.  Hey, I think I lost them.  No, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Opie, Opie.  Oh, my God.  That's my stool, you ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Something tells me Opie's a little more upset than he should be.  Oh, my God.  And it might have to do at the Met. 
[00:32:00]  He just threw a steel stool into the world's largest rock and roll library.  Hi, everyone.  Hello, this is Al Pacino, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I'm 102.7.  W-N-E-W.

[00:34:00]  Monkey, wow, worldwide monkey, and we're talking about monkeying around.  Okay, pinnacle monkeying around, Anthony.  It's been a while since we've done these live reads.  20 divers in the water.  19 came out.  Opie took the rest.  April 5th, 2000.  I'll never put on a life jacket again.  You know, we're trying to move on, but Jody's got some.  Jody?  Yeah, hi, Opie.  Hey.  I know if I have any way, he would have brought some spinach with him.  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, kick a brute as his ass.  Hey, yeah, Popeye used to do some of that.  Hey, French geek.  Popeye used to do some of that underwater.  Underwater, but he ate the spinach and, like, his arms would go really fast.  And he can make his feet go in his pipe like a propeller and go like a torpedo into the guy.  So why don't you do that?  I forgot about that.  Oh, give me spinach.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  Uh-oh, it's Opski.  And he ain't taking an Opski.  Uh-oh.  Easy.  Dup-dup-dee-oh. 
[00:35:00]  Yoski-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup.  Oh, French-ki.  Here comes French-ki.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  Hey, you stinks.  And your girl is hairy.  Uh-oh.  I'll give it a left and a right.  Scoop-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup-dee-dup.  Scoop-dee-dup-dee-dup.  It's like underwater ballet.  It was embarrassing.  Hey, chicks, women, senoritas, whatever you want to call them, those horny folks of pinnacle,  make us a pinnacle, horny goatweed.  Now something new just for women. 
[00:35:30]  Pinnacle monkeying around, Opie.  Fan the flames of passion naturally with a potent blend of the all-natural exotic herbs,  including the legendary Monkey T. Kuan Yin.  Isn't that the son of a bitch holding our sailors?  I mean, our airmen?  That Monkey T. Kuan Yin.  It might sound like a character from Kung Fu,  but this rich herbal elixir will have you screaming like Tarzan  while you're swinging on his vine.  What? 
[00:36:00]  While you're swinging?  Who wrote this?  That's great.  Pinnacle monkeying around the exciting herbal spark  that will reignite the passion in your life.  It's from the Fukin province.  Fukin province of China.  That's where our spy plane was looking at.  They wanted to see if it was actually a Fukin province  because I ain't buying it.  You'll be slipping and sliding and doing the gliding.  Oh, my God.  So for great romance and sex, remember the three Ps,  pleasure, passion, and pinnacle.  Pinnacle.  They missed the most important P. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  Two of them that you need for the good sex.  I believe there's five Ps there.  There's a couple of them.  Yeah.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  It's available at GNC and other fine health food stores  by calling them up at 1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Listen to me.  The human world is a mess.  Yeah.  Under the sea is there.  I ain't got a mess. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  The sea is always greener.  And somebody else is speaking.  The big mistake of the world.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  And she's all around. 
[00:37:30]  I'm sure they were full day.  I'll bring the sun to sail away.  While we've been boarding,  both of them floating under the sea.  Under the sea.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle monkeying around.  Get it at GNC.  When it's time to get funky,  reach for the monkey.  Opie and Anthony.  David Dukes,  who in stand-up with the Apollo,  will get more less than this crap.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:38:00]  Back from vacation Monday, April 9th, 2001.  The O&A Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  2-1-2-757-1027. 
[00:38:30]  Should we move on from the underwater fighting thing?  Vince McMahon checking in.  So yeah, Opie would be willing to battle  The Rock in an underwater cage match.  I think that's the only way I would battle The Rock.  Yeah.  Chris on my night.  Hey, Chris. 
[00:39:00]  Chris.  Opie.  Yes.  Listen, easiest way to beat a Frenchman,  on land or in water.  Tell him you're German, he'll surrender.  Yeah, you should have done that.  Very good.  Thank you, Chris.  That's the indication when Anthony stops doing cheesy disco in front of our Ratgut reunions.  Hey, why not?  It's fun.  That was a good time.  Oh, yeah.  The white pimp suit really did a nice touch, Anthony.  Well, that's...  Yeah.  That, um, that, that was...  White pimp.  Let me tell you, I almost hit the floor when I saw you come out.  It was great.  Well, that's why he did it that way. 
[00:39:30]  I know.  Okay.  I was actually...  There was nothing serious about that.  Talking about the road show, you obviously came out with the Ratgut and did the opener,  the disco opener.  But there were...  I actually got emails from people that were saying,  Dude, what's with the white suit?  What?  What?  That's the gag.  Well, yeah.  That's been a great little phrase of the day.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Our buddy... 
[00:40:00]  We'll get into it later.  Yeah, our buddy Ozone from Boston.  Quickly, just bust it again for pot.  I love his weed more than stinky.  The well, yeah, guy.  Well, yeah.  That's where we got that.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  John Astelman.  Anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  While I was fighting underwater, you did the cruise thing?  Yeah.  I almost didn't even make my cruise.  Came so friggin' close to missing the plane. 
[00:40:30]  Unbelievable.  This goddamn city.  The...  Well, the first leg of it was supposed to be home to Puerto Ricans everywhere.  It would be the tarmac at JFK.  I was supposed to fly to Puerto Rico.  Well, come on!  The...  The...  The flight's leaving at 3 o'clock on Saturday.  I'm figuring to get there, you know, within an hour, two-hour window. 
[00:41:00]  You know, plenty of time to check everything.  I get on the Belt Parkway, the wonderful Belt, and I guess Giuliani must have known I had to get to Kennedy.  He put every friggin' road crew out for pothole repairs.  Saturday afternoon.  He was listening to our show.  We were bitching about that before he went on vacation.  Pothole repairs.  I'm looking at the...  I'm looking at the westbound belt.  It's beautiful.  Eastbound, trying to get to Kennedy?  Bumper to bumper, not moving.  You know, my lease is up on my SUV. 
[00:41:30]  And I'm late for the airport.  I did not give a flying F what happened to that truck.  I had to get to Kennedy.  The center median between the east and westbound traffic of the Belt, a great place to drive if you're in a hurry.  There's no traffic there.  There is no traffic on the grassy center portion of the Belt Parkway.  But you do need an SUV or some other 4x4 vehicle. 
[00:42:00]  Don't try it in a Lexus, let's say.  There are these cement little drainage culverts.  I hit one of these things, and I wasn't going, like, 30.  I was doing the parkway speed, 55, 60 miles an hour on the grass.  If you remember, it was a little rainy Saturday morning, so it was a lot of mud.  I hit this drainage ditch, and I had maybe four or five feet in the air that the truck went. 
[00:42:30]  I swear to God, I hit a mud puddle.  And I see this guy in the left-hand lane of the eastbound Belt Parkway in this white car.  He's got his window down, smoking a bun, arm out the window.  I came down in a mud puddle.  Come in the mud.  I swear to God.  Dude.  I looked just quick enough to see a look of horror on his face as gallons of muddy water went right into, on the side of his car and into his window. 
[00:43:00]  And I would have stopped to apologize, but I was in a big hurry.  Then we get to a portion where there's no, um, there's no median left.  And I'm pissed.  Now, I'm freaking out.  I was hoping for a cop to pull me over.  I was driving.  If I had guns, I'd be firing them out of the window.  Like, pull me over.  Just pull me over so I could say, hey, I've got to get to the airport.  Because it's either airport or, because I wasn't going to make it there at that speed.  Airport or jail.  One or the other.  I'll spend my vacation somewhere. 
[00:43:30]  And it'll all be with Puerto Ricans.  Wait, wait, wait.  Either way.  Stop.  So, we take the side streets.  And I'm not paying attention to lights or anything.  Finally, you can pull into Kennedy.  I don't even know where I parked.  Like, I scrawled down some numbers on something I saw, but I think it was a no-parking sign.  I had no clue where I was.  Kennedy is, ugh, we'll get into that later.  It's just a nightmare.  I got on the, uh, I got in the TWA terminal at 2.30 for a 3 o'clock international flight. 
[00:44:00]  They don't like that.  But, uh, I asked the guy if I was going to make the flight.  He said, no way.  He said, no way?  He said, no way.  He went back to the counter.  And he's looking at me, looking like, okay, here's a guy that's just going to storm the plane with a weapon or something.  So he goes, all right, come here, come here, give me a bag.  Gave him his bag, no bags.  Dude, no ID, nothing.  The guy took the bags, put them on the little belt, punched some keys, gave me a ticket, said, gate 32.  Ran, doing the O.J.  Go, O.J., go!  Remember when he was running through the airport?  Jumping over the luggage bags and stuff, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, huffing and puffing, with, like, ten people left on line to get on the plane, uh, finally made it in there.  Uh, where I got the seat, uh, right behind the crying baby again.  The obligatory Anthony crying baby seat.  See, that's why you have to do the Club Med vacation.  Guaranteed no babies.  No babies.  But what was good is, um, I didn't care.  Like, I was just like, I made the flight.  I, I couldn't care if there was, like, one of those Indonesian flights with chickens on it, you know, as long as I'm, uh, I'm gonna make it.  And, um, made it down to Puerto Rico. 
[00:45:00]  Got on the boat.  First cruise ever.  I gotta say, these things are, um, unbelievable.  I, I, you see them on TV, uh, cruise ships and stuff, and, uh, you just can't get the scope of the size until you're there.  I was saying it, and it is, it's like driving a city block.  Take a city block with the buildings, and now take it for a spin.  Take it out for a little spin.  It's huge.  The thing's huge.  And I, I don't believe the, um, the captain is really the captain of the, of the ships. 
[00:45:30]  Because the one guy that, there you go, Meryl Stooping.  I do not see the captain as being the captain, because he, he was just a smooth guy, spoke very, uh, well, had the captainly look.  You know, the, the whole uniform.  So what's your theory on the captain?  I think you're a bartender.  Right.  That it's a figurehead.  Much like our own Ken Stevens.  Our GM here.  Powerless, yet he looks the part of the GM. 
[00:46:00]  So I think it's just a guy that goes around shaking hands, taking pictures.  And then before we leave port, he walks around and looks at the boat, like he's gonna, hey, hey, that doesn't look right.  It's just a show.  Wait, there's some Mexican guy in the bridge steering this thing out.  He, he takes a look at the boat from the dock.  Dude, he scares around.  It's like when the pilot gets out and takes the walk around the plane.  Oh, yeah.  You're gonna see the cracked hydraulic tube in engine three.  Get out of here.  It's a ploy.  It's a show thing that they do.  So he's walking around. 
[00:46:30]  You know damn well there's somebody actually driving the boat.  And we took our cruise.  I gotta tell you, bars every ten feet, a casino, and all the food you could eat.  What's, what could be better?  What the hell could be better?  I had a great vacation.  You know, you're more the scuba diving guy.  I like my drinks.  I like my fights in front of a bar.  Yeah, I was in the drink and you were, yeah, you were in the drink and I was drinking the drink.  Right.  Done.  It was great.  And then, and then we, we had, um, it was very nice. 
[00:47:00]  We had, uh, one incident where, uh, eight people missed the ship when it left one of the ports.  Oh, you were on one of those cruises where you had to do the stops on the islands and stuff?  Yeah, we stopped all over Aruba and St. Martin and St. Thomas.  And, um, when you miss the boat, you miss the boat.  You go to the airport, you buy a ticket for the next port, you land there, and you wait for the boat to get there.  That's how it works.  Because they tell you, if the ship's leaving at eight, you be on it 5.30, the latest. 
[00:47:30]  And these people miss the boat.  Can I back up?  Uh, someone has something on your captain theory.  Well, Andy, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, yeah, my father was a lawyer for cruise ships for a while, so I've been on a bunch of them.  And, as, like, the captain doesn't do anything.  Like, even when they're leaving port at the most important time, when they need to guide things.  Oh, there's a pilot on there.  There's a pilot, yeah, there's a special guy.  Special guy that leaves port, and, I mean, computers take care of everything.  Everything, it's all satellite-driven, everything.  Everything, they got the, uh, global positioning. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Get what this thing can do now.  You don't even have to drop an anchor.  Because a lot of these places, you can't drop anchor because there's coral and all kinds of environmental issues.  They, with global, uh, positioning, tied into the engines and thrusters, they can hold position in the water without an anchor.  Now, that's cool.  Right there?  You can just sit there.  And it'll, you know, it'll hold its position.  It's exactly where it is.  I just learned something today.  That is cool.  Isn't that amazing?  So you're saying the captain does nothing in the thing? 
[00:48:30]  He does nothing.  He's there to eat dinner with you.  Oh, yeah, he eats dinner, and then he gets on the horn, and it's like...  And, uh, you get feedback.  Hey, Mike, Joe, I'll give you the, uh, position of, uh, grander of the seas, uh, this morning.  We're at, uh, blah, blah, blah, latitude, blah, blah, blah, blah, longitude.  And, um, expecting to, uh, get into, uh, St. Thomas about 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.  Um, thank you.  I'm going back to the bar.  Nothing.  All right, guys.  All right, thank you, Eddie. 
[00:49:00]  Take care.  All right, sorry to, I just want to get that on.  So, all right, so, uh...  They steer the ship with, you know, you picture a ship with this huge wheel.  Like a huge captain wheel thing.  It's a joystick.  Now, that's cool.  It's a joystick.  That's cool.  It is.  It was really cool.  So, eight people missed the boat.  So, now they have to fly to the next port.  That's what you would think.  Because, God damn it, if I, if I would have, uh, gotten to Puerto Rico late and, uh, the boat would have left, I would have had to have flown to Aruba, which was the first port. 
[00:49:30]  The boat's not turning around for an.  Well, uh, eight people leave the, uh, uh, missed the boat.  All of a sudden, we're, we're eating dinner.  An hour or an hour and a half after we left port.  We're on the high seas.  We got...  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, a few of our passengers have, uh, missed the boat.  We're going to, uh, turn around.  We're not going to tie back up at the dock, but a pilot boat will bring the, uh, passengers out.  Uh, sorry for any inconvenience.  And, uh, we'll, uh, get ourselves back on schedule, um, as we, uh, get back out to sea. 
[00:50:00]  Thank you.  Now, why would they tell you that?  You wouldn't know the difference.  If they turned around, yes, we would.  Oh, you would, okay.  Because the dock, we leave the, the port, this huge, the docks for these things are gigantic.  And, uh, we left.  And everyone, it's a big thing, because everyone gets out.  You watch them untie.  You watch the thing pull away.  They got these side thrusters.  I don't know how they did it in the old days with just props on the back.  Yeah, and then you would have to get a tug or something to push the boat out.  They got side thrusters.  The boat goes completely sideways away from the port. 
[00:50:30]  Just push off the dock.  It just goes, and, and, and the, you're both sailing sideways.  Like, this is just an amazing piece of, uh, technology.  So, um, we would have known.  We would have come around and said, hey, we left that dock, you know?  And we left that huge island and the big, pretty bridge that everybody, you know, there were landmarks.  There's no bamboozling you.  Pull down a blue screen with water in front of it, like in a cartoon.  And we got to back up again.  Yeah.  You know your, your wild ride to the airport?  Yeah.  When you're driving on the median?  There's a cop on the line that swears that, that a call came in about you.  Oh, yeah?  Uh, Mike, what's going on? 
[00:51:00]  Hey, Mike.  What's up, Mike?  Yeah, Anthony.  What?  You know, if somebody out there's pissed off at you, we pulled down the wrong SUV.  What happened?  We got a car.  The highway tool was jammed up, so they pulled the next sector car to go out onto the parkway  when something like this happens.  You weren't catching me.  And, uh, we pulled down the black SUV, only it wasn't you.  Come on.  Somebody pulled down.  I tell you, as I was driving back from the airport when we got back in, uh, this past  weekend, I'm driving on the, uh, westbound side of the belt, and I'm looking where I had 
[00:51:30]  traversed.  You remember, what, one thing you did this?  There are mud friggin' tracks going up the middle divider, across the little no U-turn  things.  Yeah.  You were at the Palm Beach when you did this, weren't you?  Yeah.  All right.  You know where I was.  I know where you were.  Hey, so.  The place I could have done it.  He's not lying there.  This is a great guy, man.  We were, we were, we were like, drilling this guy, like, we just got a car, this, you're  on the black SUV, come on and go. 
[00:52:00]  And the guy's like, go away with me.  I said, well, you know what?  You're not wearing the seatbelt anyway, so.  Ah.  It wasn't a waste.  Now, if you would have pulled me over, uh, would you have, uh, helped me out getting  to the airport?  Oh, sure.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Once I gave you the ticket, I'd help you out.  You got the police cop through there.  All right, Mike.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Go NYPD.  Hey, so, yeah, uh, we, uh, we, uh, have to turn around.  Have to turn the boat around.  And, um, we're all like, Jesus Christ, who the hell are they turning around for? 
[00:52:30]  So, uh, they bring this pilot boat out.  Now, we see it in the distance coming up.  Uh, it's coming up to, uh, the side of the ship where, uh, my room was, where our room  was.  With the passengers that missed the, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All the passengers that missed the boat on this little pilot boat, chugging up to one  of the doors on the side of the boat.  The whole side of the boat that they're pulling up to, full of drunk, irritated people yelling,  F-U, A-holes.  Flipping them the bird.  You suck.  A-holes.  A-holes. 
[00:53:00]  And there was, like, uh, one big, like, a fat old woman and a young kid and stuff.  And, and the pilot boat couldn't pull up to a door that was even with the pilot boat.  They had to hook these people in harnesses and winch them up to the door.  No way.  Yeah.  So, as they're doing this, my brother is right near, my brother Joe is right near, uh, the,  where they're bringing him in.  And he's going to this woman, this old woman, big, fat, old woman, is petrified.  And he's going, I, I've seen those snap before. 
[00:53:30]  That water, you know how deep this water is?  Is that a fin?  Just yelling.  And this woman's, like, got this scared, petrified look on the face as, as thousands of drunken  people are just berating.  A-holes.  Everyone in there.  A-holes.  A-holes.  A-holes.  Cursing at them.  And then they were just the A-holes for the rest of the trip that, that missed the  boat.  And somehow they turned around for it.  And I, I hear it costs a lot of money, like, uh, to get the pilot boat to take you out.  They pay, like, $150, $200 a head just to take you back out. 
[00:54:00]  And then there's another fee you got to pay the ship to even open the door on the side.  Screw it.  Take the plane.  This guy, uh, got left at port.  Uh, Mark, what's up?  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, uh, I was, uh, going on a cruise a couple years ago with my family.  It was about 11 of us total.  Our flight, we unfortunately flew a bad airline down to Puerto Rico.  They left us at the dock.  They said, you're on your own.  You figure out how to get to the next island.  Yeah.  So they fly, or actually we had to fly down to the Dominican Republic. 
[00:54:30]  So we get up there.  All the chickens and the goats are at the airport.  You know, they're waiting there for you.  You finally get out to the dock.  And they put you on one of those pilot boats.  And I was listening to you guys.  They had to went you up.  This ship was, this boat that they took you out on, it was just bopping up and down.  There was a couple other people that missed the ship, too.  This guy fell in the water.  So it's, it happens.  That's got to be scary.  Oh.  It's no fun.  It's no fun missing the first day. 
[00:55:00]  So I caught hell for a couple days.  But, you know, hey, life's a bitch.  When you're out there, too, I mean, and there is nothing.  You're just looking out at nothing.  Pitch black.  You know, the sky, you see the stars and stuff, but there's no land around you.  Just water.  I'm looking out there like, monsters out there.  I know there are.  Monsters.  We didn't do the, um, the, uh, little, uh, training exercise they put everyone through  on the first night also.  If the ship sinks.  You're supposed to run back to your room. 
[00:55:30]  There's a big drill.  They do it for everybody.  I got there a little late.  I wanted to enjoy my dinner.  They do drills, really?  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  They do these drills, emergency drills, uh, to get to your lifeboat stations, your muster  stations.  And, um, me and, uh, me and my girlfriend got in late.  Because we, we got, took the later flight.  And we got on the ship.  We were hungry.  So we sit down, uh, at the table to eat.  And they're like, um, everybody at this point, we're going to do our drills.  So go to your room, get your life jackets, and go to your, uh, appropriate muster stations 
[00:56:00]  and, uh, blah, blah, blah.  Like, screw this.  I'm eating.  I need some food.  Because I had, I had a theory.  Those drills aren't going to do squat in an emergency.  It's all very organized.  Everyone goes to their room at the same time.  Everyone gets their life jacket, puts it on, goes to the muster station.  And that they know where it is because it's in your room.  It tells you where to go.  And, uh, you meet there.  They do a little roll call, tell you what boat you're getting on.  And, uh, then you go back to your room, drop your life jacket off, and continue having 
[00:56:30]  a great time.  No.  So I'm sitting there watching, going, if you think there's a huge explosion that rips out  part of the boat, smoke, fire, and this sucker's going down, that the little guy, the little  old man and his little rascal that I saw scooting by with a life jacket on is going to get off  this boat.  Someone's on some serious drugs.  It's more like a scene out of, uh, Braveheart.  Yeah.  And I know without doing a drill.  I know I'm getting on a goddamn boat.  Right.  I know I'm getting a life jacket. 
[00:57:00]  If I got to snatch one off a little kid running by, I don't care.  You go to your room, get your jacket.  I'll take it.  I'll help you punch it for it.  Especially if you're friends.  So, the drills are ridiculous.  There's got people in wheelchairs.  There's like, um, there's old, I saw this old couple that had to be in their, in their  nineties.  And, uh, the one guy is holding the woman's elbow and she's got a life jacket.  I'm like, dead.  Dead.  Because if it's not catastrophic enough where the ship goes down quick, you're not going 
[00:57:30]  to have to get on the life boat.  There's going to be, the air and sea is going to be full of people to save you.  But if it's so catastrophic that this happens quickly, they're dead.  Jump in the nice blue warm water of the Caribbean, peel a jacket off the dead elderly couple, and  you're fine.  So, I, uh, I opted out of the mustard drill in favor of eating and drinking and gambling. 
[00:58:00]  I would be a true survivor.  Hell yeah!  I ain't going down with that ship, but I'm not going through any drills.  There's Anthony beating up an old man in his life jacket.  He cannot get it off, so he assaults his 80-year-old wife.  I would!  Who's kidding who?  Of course. 
[00:58:30]  So, I don't need a drill.  All right, let's go to Wayne.  Wayne, you're next on N.E.W.  What's up?  Wayne, Wayne.  How's it going?  How's it going, Anthony?  All right.  Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know about the captain.  You've got to remember all the responsibility of everybody on board, plus the ship.  It always falls under the old man.  Right.  Well, you know, the officers take care of the navigation and the weather reports and everything  else, but he's actually the one responsible in case anything happens.  Yeah, but, you know, he's just walking around taking his photo ops. 
[00:59:00]  It's a great gig if you can get it.  You just better pray nothing ever goes wrong.  I guess so.  Yeah, that would be true.  I was in the merchant for 14 years.  I was in the officer for a long time, and, uh, you know, they have a pretty sweet job.  They do, man.  They're on a cruise.  They're doing well.  What ship were you on, anyway?  The grandeur of the seas.  Royal Caribbean.  Royal Caribbean line.  Yeah, it was a pretty good line.  Yes.  It was a pretty good line.  Hey, give me another cruise, Royal Caribbean. 
[00:59:30]  Thank you.  I actually had to pay for this one.  And Opie and Sandy's vacation.  No, no, no.  I'm teasing, of course.  All right, Wayne.  Thank you.  The only other thing is about the fire drill.  Yeah.  If you ever have a real fire, you know, every one of them stewards is grabbing a life raft  and heading for them boats.  Of course they are.  What are you kidding?  Everyone loves to think they'd be so nice.  Yeah, there'd be a couple of stories of heroism and a couple of the crew members that went above  and beyond to get people off.  But for the most part, you know what it would look like? 
[01:00:00]  Go outside on a nice spring day like this.  Find yourself an anthill.  Now, kick it.  There you go.  That's the deck of the ship.  That's it.  Love, sir.  Thank you, Wayne.  Take care, guys.  We got to check in with Earl.  He's at Shea Stadium today.  Black Earl.  What's up?  Is that French Opie at Shea Stadium?  Shea Stadium.  Earl.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Earl.  We are by the subway station here at Shea Stadium.  The Mets are on their way to an opening day victory.  I heard that. 
[01:00:30]  What happened?  And then we ended up wild stickers.  We'll be here for probably about a half hour or so.  I'm moving on.  So where are you, man?  I'm located right by the subway station, by the big, giant turnstile.  Yeah.  You heard that last thing because everyone seems to be heading this way.  Hey, Earl, thanks for the help.  You're on a subway station by a big turnstile. 
[01:01:00]  Okay.  Shea Stadium.  We're right in front of Gate E.  What you want at Shea?  You don't want to hire niggas.  That's all.  Help.  You should be happy that wouldn't.  How's Dan the man doing?  He's with you today?  Yep.  Dan's with us.  AJ's also here.  All right.  Chuckle, Burkett.  Tony Soprano, come on now.  Well, you're handing out the WOW stickers because Whip Them Out Wednesday comes back in full force in two days.  Right, Earl?  Yes, sir.  That's totally gorgeous out here.  Everyone's asking for you guys. 
[01:01:30]  It's a beautiful day for baseball.  Make sure you look for Earl at the WOW sticker stop by a subway station turnstile.  Hold on, Earl.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Bring it up for WOW sticker.  Earl is by a turnstile.  By the way, we're kicking the Braves' ass, right?  9-3, I think.  Yeah, they're up like 9-4. 
[01:02:00]  9-4 now?  Yeah, Piazza, he had two home runs, and the new guy, the Japanese guy, hit a bomb in the straightaway center field.  New guy.  Thanks.  You're giving a lot of good details.  New Japanese guy.  I can't pronounce the name.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, Earl, thank you very much.  Thank you, guys.  Check in in a little while so we can goof on you some more, okay?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Remember, when you get your sticker...  I got it from a Negro.  That's right.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Talk to you in a bit. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  That's right.  We got a whole year of Bob Murphy.  And Bob Murphy.  We were listening to him, and he's just as insane as usual.  A lot of articles being written, you know, before the season started that, man, it's time for him to...  Yeah.  To move.  And Piazza hit a home run, and he's like, in the midst, clinch the pennant.  No.  Home opener.  Slow down.  We got the classic Bob Murphy call here.  Oh, this one's great.  The pitch.  High five-one.  It's deep to left center field. 
[01:03:00]  It's way back.  It may be playable.  Hagmai Yanni can't get a play.  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  Did he run out the wall?  I was not sure he was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Hagmai Yanni.  I apologize.  He was way out there, and it didn't look like he had a play on it, but he caught it against the wall and left center field.  You know his eyes are just gone, so he's been doing it long enough where he just assumed, okay, that's long enough, that's gone.  High five all deep to center field, and it's home run. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  Oh, no, strike two.  I thought I saw a ball.  It was a pigeon.  Carl Smith, see you checking in?  Oh, very cool.  We love this guy.  He's very politically incorrect.  No.  I wouldn't say that.  We love that about him.  We'll talk to him next.  Stay there.  Hoot, hoot, hoot.  Opie and Anthony.  Jerk watch.  Make me sick to my ass.  1027.  WNEW. 
[01:04:00]  Catch the best.  End of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays.  W.  11 to 3.  1027.  WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  Wow, that was cute.  They got some work done while we were gone.  Nice.  And I see my pouring us out even more. 
[01:04:30]  Ah, hoot.  Opie, maybe Bob Murphy will truly F up and he'll imagine the Mets winning the World Series.  There you go.  It has begun.  Thank you.  Dan from Hoboken.  Carlos Mencia must be calling because Anthony interrupted one of his median picnics last week.  I had to get to the airport.  Sorry. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, I think it is median.  No, no, not yet, Rick.  I think it is median picnic season.  It's a beautiful day for a median picnic.  A couple more calls on cruises and we'll move on to Carl.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Richard, you were talking about those cruises that you go on to the Bahamas and stuff?  Yes.  I went on one about ten years ago on my honeymoon.  Walked into the room.  Everything's fine.  Punk beds.  You have fun beds.  Punk beds.  Punk beds on your honeymoon. 
[01:05:30]  I'm like, what the hell is going on?  On your honeymoon, you shouldn't be having sex in the bed anyway.  Breaking every other piece of furniture around the room.  Yeah, well, it's not helping any, that's for sure.  Yeah.  But that's about it.  Take care, guys.  All right, Bill.  There are some people that love to go.  I don't think they're enjoying their room very much.  You know, you go down, when you pull into some of these ports, you've got to go down  to the first deck to get off the boat.  When you get on, you're getting on at like the fourth because they've got the big terminal 
[01:06:00]  that you walk up the stairs and you're getting on like the fourth deck.  Down at the bottom thing there, it's a little different than being at the top of the ship.  That's where the Haitians go.  I think it's where, first of all, all the employees room down there.  Because you look at these little portholes, if the rooms even have them, and there's like  plants growing in there.  They try to make it seem a little homey, I guess.  But a lot of people just, a lot of people, they like where the ship goes and you go to 
[01:06:30]  the beach and everything like that.  But I guess they, you know, they cut a few corners on their vacation budget by getting  a smaller room.  And you might end up with bunk beds on your honeymoon if you do that, if you go that route.  Drew, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, we went down, just a couple of years back, seven years ago, about 10 of us went  down after a, we worked out in Vail, Colorado for the summer, and after the winter, at the  end of the winter, we were on a cruise.  We got left on St. John's. 
[01:07:00]  We were partying at a bar all day, and we just watched the back of the cruise ship just  take off.  So we're like blown out.  We're like, what the hell are we going to do?  We're all like 21, 22 at the time.  We're like, wow, do I call my parents?  Next thing I know, there's a guy who offered us to take a plane to St. Martin.  For 280 hours.  We're like, all right.  So we're hanging out.  We look at the plane, and we're like, let's go get drunk.  We're going to the plane.  We come back, and we're in the bar talking to the bartender, telling him what happened.  He goes, my buddy over there will take you over in a boat. 
[01:07:30]  It'll take you about 45 minutes to an hour.  We'll do it for like 50 hours.  I'm like, huh?  We're talking to the guy.  He goes, it's a nice bus and well.  The guy's a fishing boat.  We get on the bus and well.  Turns out, like, St. Martin from St. John's is like an hour.  When you're telling these little stories?  Here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Thanks for that.  Wow, that was ponderous.  I believe his actual point, a lot of these islands are close together.  And they say, yeah, we'll be docking tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock. 
[01:08:00]  And it's like 7 o'clock the previous night you're leaving.  It doesn't take no 24 hours to get there.  You look on the map, it's like a 15-minute ride.  Or what the hell they do.  Because you're really cranking.  You're cruising through the sea.  I think they go way out and go way back in.  Oh, yeah.  They make some big circles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some big arcs.  Brooke is on the line.  Hey, Brooke.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm on the Taconic.  And I just saw my first picnic. 
[01:08:30]  I thought I'd call you.  You just saw your first picnic of the year.  Yes, I did.  Of course, those are those little picnics that pop up on the side of the parkways.  They do.  Usually by people of some Hispanic descent open.  Yes.  I think that's what it is, guys.  What do they have?  The little lounge chairs?  Yeah.  An umbrella?  No umbrella.  No, I think they were catching some rays out here.  And a hibachi.  Yes.  To cook on.  All right.  Speaking of spicnics, Carlos Mencia is on the line. 
[01:09:00]  Let's say hi to our buddy from L.A.  Carlos Mencia.  Dude, did you just call me a spicnick?  No.  You weren't listening closely.  I love you, dude.  That's awesome.  No, no, no.  We're talking about how the spics, they have their picnics on the side of the parkway when  the weather gets warm.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  That's my people.  You drive down to Connick or you drive down a lot of the parkways and highways around 
[01:09:30]  New York.  I've seen them off the Northern State Parkway.  And the car's pulled over, the trunk's up, they got a hibachi cooking, the kids are running  around playing because it's a grassy area.  You don't have that in L.A., Carlos?  Sure we do, bro.  We do the same thing here, man.  Yeah?  Except we have a hard time barbecuing because, you know, the beans fall through the grill.  Ah, yeah.  So how have you been?  I've been good, man.  I've been awesome.  I haven't called you guys because I've been, like, doing two movies at the same time, touring. 
[01:10:00]  I've just been, like, I've been the busy immigrant wetback, bro.  Yeah, look at you bragging.  I am, I'm bragging, dude.  Nothing wrong with that.  I should brag, man.  It's been a long time since, you know.  I mean, they're calling me to do movies and they don't even ask me to audition, bro.  How cool is that?  That's very cool.  We're waiting for that.  And I'm not playing, like, The Gardener or, you know.  The Gardener.  No?  You're giving me real roles.  Yeah, they're giving me real roles, dude.  But they actually, a friend of mine who's half Cuban, half Puerto Rican, just got a part on The Soprano. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, really?  Really, yeah.  So now they're even letting us, like, venture outside our stickiness and be something else.  Goddamn, everyone's getting a part on that show.  So, what, your friend was the rapist from two weeks ago on The Soprano?  No, it's the guy, man.  I think he whacks somebody or something, or he gets whacked or something like that.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, so I heard about that lawyer guy.  What's up with him, dude? 
[01:11:00]  Well, are you talking about The Soprano lawsuit?  Yeah, the guy that's, yeah.  You got to help us out, because we just got back from vacation, so we're a little slow.  Who's suing who, as far as The Sopranos go?  Some greasy Italian guy is upset, I guess, because The Sopranos represent, you know, Italians in a bad light or whatever.  It's like, God, man, why you got to cry?  It's just a movie.  It's not even a movie.  It's just a TV show, man. 
[01:11:30]  Can we be entertained without people getting all freaked out?  Like, I'm Italian.  I could give a crap.  I love this show.  There are people out there that just don't want to be happy.  They don't want to be entertained.  They have to find fault with everything.  Now they're going to attempt to try to tone down The Sopranos?  Makes Italians look bad.  What, like Italians weren't ever involved in organized crime?  Let's be real.  But that's the whole point.  Like, no stereotypes are true.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  None of them.  None of them.  You know?  Of course. 
[01:12:00]  Don't make movies about Italian mafia.  Let's do movies about the Canadian mafia.  Because that's the real mafia.  That's the underground mafia nobody knows about.  So we need to do a movie about the Canucks.  Yeah.  What crap is that?  Do you know what I mean?  Come on.  People think that it makes Italians look bad.  And they think it's all Italians are doing this.  And that's why they want to file this.  No, but it's not all Italians.  But let me tell you, I believe there were a few Italians in organized crime. 
[01:12:30]  And if you want to make a movie about it, I'm going to watch it because they're damn entertaining.  And the rapist was Puerto Rican.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, here's what I think you should do.  I think people should use stereotypes to help themselves.  Like, if you're Italian and some guy's about to beat your ass somewhere for something that you did or said or whatever,  then you cling to the stereotype that you got friends and family in weird places,  and you help stereotypes. 
[01:13:00]  You know what I mean?  Like when Jesse Jackson got caught with another woman and he was a baby daddy,  how cool would it have been if he would have just said, well, I'm black.  Oh, he's black.  Of course.  That explains everything.  You know, just use the stereotype.  Like that whole thing going down in China.  Yeah.  What's up with that, man?  I turn on the news every day.  Who caused the crash?  We're not sure.  An American guy flying, a Chinese guy flying.  We all know who caused that accident.  Why don't you just say it?  They can't drive, let alone fly. 
[01:13:30]  Get your chin cats out of the cockpit, buddy.  We know you caused the crash.  And why is that, Carlos?  Because they can't say...  Because they can't drive.  They can't fly.  I don't know.  Too much peripheral vision.  Who cares why they just can't fly?  Hey, Chinese people fly so bad.  Even my Japanese friends are like, oh, this sucks really bad.  I'm telling you, man.  We can't say that.  Well, I've noticed the Japanese people, their eyes aren't as slanty as the Chinese eyes.  Ah, maybe that's it. 
[01:14:00]  They drive a little better.  So they can see a little better.  Listen, here in L.A., right?  They were going to sue.  The Mexican, some Mexican organization was going to sue ABC, NBC, and CBS.  Because they said that in every program, Mexicans are portrayed negatively because on all the  shows like Nash Bridges and Law and Order and NYPD Blue, all they do is get arrested.  That's what they said.  So they're like, we're going to sue because all you do is make us illegal aliens and arrest 
[01:14:30]  us and make us felons.  But they decided not to sue.  They decided to write a very aggressive letter from jail, of course, showing their discontent.  You're a pisser, man.  Whatever, man.  You know what it's like?  It's like if you walk up to a black guy, right, and you go, is it true black people love watermelon?  He's going to be like, no, man, that's not true.  Is it true black people love fried chicken? 
[01:15:00]  He's like, oh, no, that's not true.  But I ask him, is it true all black men have large penis?  Yeah.  Oh, you know that's true.  Well, if you've got a black penis, you love Kool-Aid, too, bitch, all right?  It's one or all.  You know what I'm saying?  You can't handpick them, right.  And it's like good stuff, too.  You know what I mean?  It's not like it's, why don't they sue?  You know what they should sue?  They should sue when they make bad movies. 
[01:15:30]  You know what I mean?  When they make bad stuff that really makes Italians look bad because the acting sucks.  You know, the Italian guy sounds Puerto Rican, that's the people they should sue.  They shouldn't sue the Sopranos.  The Sopranos makes Italians look good.  Actually, for the first time, they look human.  You know what I mean?  In reality, because, you know, now, what's his name?  He has to go to the doctor and he actually has feelings and he feels remorse when he calls  the black guy a nigga and stuff. 
[01:16:00]  Well, not really.  Well, he doesn't have it.  He did, though, bro, because right after he did it, he had a heart.  He had, like, one of those panic attacks.  Yeah, but I think that was because his daughter's going out with a black guy.  The only reason he had a panic attack is because he was visualizing his daughter getting it.  Like we all did over the weekend.  Yeah, he saw the Uncle Ben Rice in the cabinet there.  Well, maybe, but then maybe, I mean, it's left for interpretation is my point, so the point  can be made.  There ain't going to be no interpretation when he finds out that guy had sex with his daughter. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, my God.  Really? What do you think is going to happen?  That's going to be, see, that's what I mean.  Carlos.  What kind of land do these lawyers lead that that's not interesting?  I have a feeling you haven't watched The Sopranos in a couple of weeks because the black  guy broke up with Meadow.  No, I haven't watched it like a, what happened, Mike?  My cable just went to digital?  The Noah character broke up with Meadow.  Had sex with her and then dumped her.  I'm saying she's pregnant because he's black. 
[01:17:00]  Of course.  Well, he might not be.  If he was Hispanic, for sure she'd be pregnant.  Because my people, dude, we just look at a bitch and she, uh-oh, you got to pay.  It's bad, dude.  You got to talk to Meadow and see how naked she was during that scene.  Will she talk to us again?  She's scared of our radio show, unfortunately, huh, Rick?  Is she?  Well, her brother's a huge fan of the show.  Yeah, actually, right now she's on tour with some theater company, Cinderella Productions.  Right.  But she's going to be in New York very soon.  All right.  We should talk to my brother and how he felt about watching that. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, you don't want your sister getting railed by some black guy.  Is little Italian in real life?  No, I think she's Jewish.  Yeah, she's not Italian in real life.  She's got some Jewish blood in her.  Oh, she's got water stuff.  And a few other guys in there.  Oy vey, you're with a schwarze.  Exactly.  You're schwarze like a schwarze.  That's the worst, dude.  I mean, I would say that if it comes to Italians, like, you know, hating the blacks and the Jews, 
[01:18:00]  like, not liking their dogs, I think the Jewish one would be a little more pissed.  I don't know.  I think Tony's going to freak out.  Can't wait to see that.  It's going to be good.  But, like, what's upsetting about it?  I mean, I know that not every Italian guy is in the mafia, even though I treat him like it,  because you never know.  But, I mean, you know what I'm saying?  It's like every Chinese guy doesn't know karate, but if I get into a crash with an Asian guy,  I make damn sure I'm not aggressive.  You know what I'm saying? 
[01:18:30]  Because you never know that that might be the one.  He might be the one that knows the karate.  Exactly.  He might kick my ass.  So I don't want to be the one to be like, hey, you don't know karate.  I mean, then, you know, like Billy Jack, I'm going to put these fools under that kind of your face.  I don't want to be that guy.  Right.  The world is getting way too PC.  It's getting ridiculous.  I mean, it's a small group of people, you know.  I don't want that guy speaking for me.  Right.  I like this show.  Trying to cause trouble with the stereotypes of the Sopranos.  Most people don't even care.  No.  They just know it's a well-written show, and it's a great show to watch on Sundays. 
[01:19:00]  Over here in San Francisco, they had, right, with the fat people.  Oh, by the way, Carlos, Tim on Line 8 says, Carlos, you have to pay your cable bill to see the Sopranos.  No, it's not that I can't get HBO and Cinefax right now.  You just got to climb up the pole and take the filter off.  No, it's not bad, dude.  I went from digital.  I mean, I'm going from regular cable to digital, so they have to come and do this weird thing in my house. 
[01:19:30]  Carlos, who are you kidding?  You're Mexican.  All right, man.  You don't pay for cable?  I was trying to pretend I have a little more money than the rest of my people.  But you're right.  I get paid in government cheese like the rest of us.  I'll watch the reruns, man.  You know, I mean, I missed two.  I'm getting cable back on Friday.  The last two were great.  Were they really?  Disturbing as hell, but great.  The one, not yesterday, but the week before? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  With the girl getting the Aspied out of her?  Oh, my God.  I bought a bing?  That was sick.  That was deeply disturbing.  Yeah, yeah.  And the girl was so hot, too.  Even with the braces.  Is this really Meadows' brother?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let's talk to him.  Hold on there, Carlos.  Hold on, Carlos.  Oh, Meadows' brother's in?  Hey, Brian.  Yeah.  Brian, what's up, man?  What's going on, guys?  How do we know this is Meadows' brother?  Because I've been with Rick a bunch of times.  He's got my number.  Rick, is it definitely him?  Yeah, this is the voice.  All right, this is Meadows' brother.  How's Jamie Lynn doing? 
[01:20:30]  She's doing very well, thank you.  Good.  She's actually on tour right now.  Yeah?  Now, you watched the episode of her having sex?  Yeah, I have.  Now, dude, how is that?  That was rough.  I remember when she was filming it, and she was pretty nervous about it.  Hey, Brian.  Yeah?  I know your sister's a good actor, but that's not all acting.  Oh, Effie, stop.  Oh, all actors admit they take from, you know, life experience. 
[01:21:00]  Brian, she looked pretty hot.  I've got to say, all nervous.  And she's holding her arms up, kind of covering up a little bit.  That was pretty good.  Brian, your sister's really hot this season.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you very much.  Well, she's not done.  I'll leave you with that.  Then that was supposed to be our first time having sex, huh?  Yeah, on the show, yeah.  Yeah.  So what did Mom and...  They didn't come out and say it, but it left it out there.  What did Mom and Dad think? 
[01:21:30]  I know Mom and Dad were a little nervous to watch it.  Yeah?  Aw.  But they didn't mind.  It was tastefully done.  Did you sit there and watch it with your parents?  No.  I actually watched it alone.  I was a little uncomfortable watching it with my parents.  That would have been kind of funny to watch it with your parents and go,  Wow, she's getting nailed, Pop.  Yeah, I'm sure my dad would have loved me if it was flying and hit me in the face.  So I think what we wanted to ask you, was Meryl naked for that scene or...  Yeah, what was she wearing during that on the set? 
[01:22:00]  Did she tell you?  I think for...  I think she had...  You know what?  I'm not entirely sure.  I can ask her in the back of you.  Yeah, do that because we want to know.  Hey, Brian.  Let's see if it's nothing.  Hey, Brian.  Brian, you've got to get your sister to call our show.  It's been a while.  Yeah.  I will.  Well, she's going to be back in New York for two weeks.  Beginning of May, the first two weeks in May.  Yeah, because we're loving her in The Sopranos this season.  They're giving her a lot.  Yeah, it's a lot.  She has a big one coming up next week, too.  That lunatic... 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, she's on X next week.  Yeah, on the X.  Yeah.  So is that the first time she's ever done X?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, that's no acting.  Wow.  That would rock.  Yeah, it's going to be a good one next week.  Is she going to show off her snatch panties?  I don't know.  Those are the kind of questions that I stay away from.  It's the sister.  Sure.  But the guy's always asking her, though, and saying,  Hey, your sister's hot.  Could you hook me up?  Trust me.  At around 9.20, two Sundays ago, I had about ten messages on my machine. 
[01:23:00]  Your sister's a slut.  What's she doing getting laid in the sun?  A slut.  That's classic.  I got them all, so...  Right on, Brian.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Have her call us.  And if you find out what she was wearing, let us know.  I'll make sure to.  Hey, thank you, Brian.  All right, guys.  Stay easy.  Stay back.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  We're disappointed with no anal scenes.  Oh, Rick.  Sorry.  It's always over the top, Rick. 
[01:23:30]  Always.  Sorry.  Talk to Brian, Rick.  Don't apologize, Rick.  Metal Sopranos.  I'm a tool.  Metal Sopranos, brother.  Rick.  Holds up the sign.  Actually, Brian Siegler.  Carlos.  Yo.  You're still there.  Sorry about that.  Oh, no.  That's all right, man.  I think that dude slipped it in.  You think so?  Yeah, just like the tip, bro.  Just, you know what I mean?  Just like the shiny part.  Just to get everyone in the mood, right?  The shiny part.  Just the shiny part, bro. 
[01:24:00]  Just the German part.  The little helmet head.  Just that part.  The Kaiser helmet.  Hey, Carlos, a couple guys on the line want to know where they can find your CD.  They can't find it anywhere.  Oh, it's sold out?  Well, they could go to my website, dude, carlosmencia.com, and we'll mail them on with an autograph, but  they think it should be at stores.  Actually, I'm having that problem with selling out everywhere now, especially out, you know,  where you guys are, because you guys are so cool, man. 
[01:24:30]  But, you know, just go wherever.  You know, I get probably a comedy CD a week.  Yours is right up there.  It's one of the best ones out there, so.  Yeah, my new stuff is awesome, man.  So I'm going to have to put up a new one soon.  Well, send some of the new stuff over.  We'll play.  We'll give it a little spin.  Oh, cool, man.  You know what I'll do?  I'll just, like, call you guys on Fridays and do, like, weekend updates, because I write.  I, you know, I really don't write down stuff.  I just, you know, whatever's happening in the news, I'll just, it just fires me up, 
[01:25:00]  and I'll do stuff about it.  So, you know, I already got hate mail from, from, wait a minute, who includes, the Asians  gave me a death threat, because I've been doing this joke about them, they can't drive,  and this whole Chinese thing.  So they sent me a death threat.  Mexicans sent me a death threat, because I do this joke about Mexicans from Mexico are  different from Mexicans from the United States, so they're pissed at me.  Wait, I love that.  Just give us a little taste of that, because that is really funny. 
[01:25:30]  That's just the reality, dude.  I mean, listen, I'm of Mexicans, you know what it's like?  It's like Italians.  The people that, like, the guy that says it makes Italians look bad, Italians live in  Italy, in that thing that looks like a book.  Right.  That's where Italians live.  They don't leave there.  They love that place, and when they leave, they go back.  People in New York are not real Italian, and I know some of them are going to get upset.  They're screaming at their radio right now in their car.  But I could give a rat, Chad, because if you were real Italian, you would speak Italian. 
[01:26:00]  You'd live in Florence, or you'd live in Rome, or you'd live in some little place in Sicily,  but you don't.  You live in New York, and New York is a part of the United States of America, not the United  States of America, plus Italy.  If you came from there on a boat a long time ago and decided that that country sucked,  so you came to this one, because it was better, so we made a Statue of Liberty, so that you  could be happy when you get here, you dumbass.  No.  I don't care where you come from.  Wherever you came from, your country sucks.  All right?  That's why you came here. 
[01:26:30]  You divorced that bitch, and married this one, be glad, because this one's got big knockers  and a nice snatch.  So you'll be glad, buddy.  Hey, that's good.  I just made that up right now.  I've never said that before.  That's funny.  You guys inspire me, brother.  But what's the difference between the Mexicans that live in America and the ones from Mexico?  Well, first of all, it's like Mexicans from here can eat Taco Bell. 
[01:27:00]  You know, that's like one of the things.  We can't tolerate Taco Bell.  Most of us don't speak Spanish.  You know, like most Italians don't speak real Italian.  They speak like kind of like a half Italian, and then they'll throw in an Italian and say  one word, and then, you know, they'll throw in, hey, the mulignon, and then they'll speak  English again.  That's the same.  But Mexicans from Mexico, bro, they're hardcore, like midgets, because, you know, they grew up  over there, man.  They didn't get any of the good food we got, bro.  Like, my mother is four foot, like four, four, four, six, maybe. 
[01:27:30]  And I'm only five nine, five ten, bro.  But in my family, all my brothers are giant.  Damn, you're like big, bro.  Because you guys are good food.  Exactly, bro.  I was in malnutrition, so I grew.  Yeah.  But see, what I did was, I'm with a white girl who's six foot tall, so I'm, you know,  getting the gene pool to, like, you know, normal, average height.  You're white women, huh? 
[01:28:00]  You're stretching out the, uh, all right.  Hold on again.  No, no, Hispanic chicks, you don't, um, young Hispanic Mexican chicks don't, uh, give BJs.  No, huh?  Yeah, you put it in front of them, and they're like, ah, pee-pee comes out of there, and they're  crying, and, you know, then I got to defend myself and say, hey, well, pee-pee comes out  of there, too, and you don't stop me when I'm going south of the border, you know?  So I got to defend myself and say, look, pee-pee comes out of your thing, I still go down there, 
[01:28:30]  blood comes out of your thing, I still go down there, some yellow stuff on your underwear  called discharge, I still go down, I don't even know what's at the secret sauce or something,  but, hey, I'll go there.  All right, we get it.  Hey, uh, Chris.  How you doing, O.N.?  Turn down your damn radio.  I'm going to call it if he wants to hear it, too.  That's off.  Oh, you got to turn it off, because we're on a long delay, he's not going to hear it  until you hang up.  That's off.  All right.  All right.  You're pissed at Carlos for the Italian remark?  Yeah, we live in America. 
[01:29:00]  I'm an Italian-American.  That's what it is.  You come here, you speak English.  Okay, okay, here it is.  If you think you're an Italian-American, it's April 9th.  In six days, on April 15th, if you're half-American, why is the government going to take all your money?  Fuck.  I live here.  I own a house I packed.  What are you talking about?  I didn't jump over from the border.  You're not a half-Italian, dude.  You're all-American.  Yes, I'm all-American, but I'm sent.  No, you're of Italian descent.  That's what I said. 
[01:29:30]  I even know.  You said you're Italian-American.  American-Italian, however you want to describe it, but I'm still Italian.  Dude, you're American.  What?  You're American, period.  Of Italian descent.  I agree.  There we agree.  But you're not Italian-American or American-Italian.  Because when America needs you, you're a base of Social Security number.  Like, when we go to war, they don't put half of your name up on that wall.  They put your whole name, because you died for America, not for Italy.  I never said I was half-American. 
[01:30:00]  I'm full-blooded American, but I'm of Italian descent.  I agree.  There you go.  Yeah, what are you saying?  You're not Italian-American.  You're an American of Italian descent, and that's completely different.  Sure, but when my family came here, they said, listen, we're American now.  We're going to speak English.  Right.  What's an evening card?  They have American English directions and Spanish directions.  Why? 
[01:30:30]  I agree with you.  What do you mean?  What do you mean, what am I saying?  They totally agree.  These two agree on everything, but for some reason, there's still hatred because of different  nationalities.  No, no, no, dude.  We're doomed as a nation and a planet.  Carlos, go.  What?  I'm not mad at the guy.  If it wasn't for Spaniards and Italians, dude, I'd be short, midget, named Quoxicliciclexic  with all kinds of exes.  I'm cool. 
[01:31:00]  They came.  They bombed my ancestors, and I got taller.  I'm glad, bro.  I'm not mad at you.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  He agreed with me.  I know.  I don't know what.  All right.  Carlos.  He agreed with me, and he was mad at me.  Carlos, you know how he would have agreed with you 100% if he would have, instead of saying  Italian-Americans, he used African-Americans, then he'd have been like, yeah, why can't  those moolies just consider themselves American?  You know why?  Because that's too easy. 
[01:31:30]  That's why.  Because if your Italian defended ass doesn't get it when it comes to you, but you laugh  when I do the black joke, then you're a hypocrite, and I'm glad that the Soprano  shows that you hate niggas.  How about that one?  Wow.  Dave, what's up?  Well, I have to agree with Carlos, because I have, my background is Russian-Hungarian.  I am an American, but the fact is, I'm Jewish, and everyone says, oh, you're Jewish, huh?  You're from Israel? 
[01:32:00]  See, it's worse with the Jewish people, because everyone thinks, just because you're Jewish,  you come from Israel and that type of a background.  It's not like people say to Catholics, oh, you're from Bethlehem?  Yeah, see, and it's easy for you, dude, because I grew up in California, right, where everybody's  Mexican in L.A., but my mom is Mexican.  But my dad was actually born in Honduras, Central America.  So for me, it's worse because nobody knows where Honduras is. 
[01:32:30]  So when people ask me around here, hey, dude, man, where are you from?  You're funny.  And I say, oh, I was born in Honduras?  They say, what part of Mexico is that, dude?  Ha-ha.  And then when I go to, like, because if you're white or you're Jewish, it doesn't matter where  you go, you still stay white and Jewish.  Like, if you come here in L.A., you're Jewish, or in New York, you're Jewish, or in Denver,  you're Jewish.  See, I'm Mexican in California and Texas, but then when I go to, like, Miami, all of a sudden,  my ass is Cuban. 
[01:33:00]  And then when I go to New York, of course, I'm Puerto Rican, and if they don't like me,  then I'm Dominican.  So.  Oh, bravo.  All right, Dave, thank you.  I got to suck balls.  All right, fine.  Look at this.  Ryan from Westchester checking in.  And he says he's Irish, and he just says he's from the bar.  All right.  That works.  But I like that guy.  Let me go to Rob real fast here.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Good.  We're hanging out with Carlos Mencia, a very funny guy. 
[01:33:30]  What's up, Rob?  Listen.  How you doing?  Why is it only that the nationalities that are basically like the scrape at the bottom  of the barrel call themselves blank American?  You never hear German-American.  It's always, yo, man, I'm Mexican-American, man, or, hey, man, I'm African-American.  You never hear a Greek-American or a German-American.  It's always the bottom of the barrel saying that they're blank American.  Okay.  Sorry.  That's all right.  We had to dump out of that.  But there you go.  I've never heard Irish-American. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Irish-American.  Well, you know, it's always the lower part of the minorities.  Yeah, but you're right.  You're right.  It's not like European-American is ever a term used anymore.  It's pretty much like, you know, well, Puerto Ricans don't count because Puerto Ricans are lucky  enough that they're born, you know, Americans, so they don't have to deal with it.  But, like, you know, it's the Cuban-American. 
[01:34:30]  You know what I mean?  It's the African-American or the Mexican-American.  You know what I mean?  And you're right, dude, because we have a complex.  You know what I mean?  We feel like...  Yeah, I don't think it is.  That was my point, basically.  Oh, no.  And you're right, dude.  We have a complex about it.  It's like, oh, man, people look down on me and people look at me funny, so I'm going to  cling to my thing and I'm Mexican and I'm Cuban.  And I agree, dude.  It's stupid and it's retarded. 
[01:35:00]  And you know what I mean?  Yeah, I think it all started with African-American, basically.  Because, you know, Malcolm X started the, I'm not a Negro, I'm African-American, and  they started this big mess.  Now everybody's on the wagon train, you know?  Carlos has a great bit about African-Americans.  Hey, listen.  African-Americans straight up.  I'll prove to you that you have nothing left from Africa.  And this is not a mean thing.  I want you to know that you're straight up Americans.  But any black guy listening or woman listening to the show right now, that you think you're 
[01:35:30]  part African.  American, I swear to God, I will buy your ass a two-way ticket, not a one-way, because  when you find out you're going to want to come back.  I'll be nice enough to get you a round-trip ticket to Rwanda.  Your black ass will land there.  They'll look at you and go, oh, chum-dum-bum-boobole.  Because you're black, you speak that, and when they go chum-dum-bum-boobole, your ass is going  to be like, oh, damn.  I'm from around here, man.  When you look around and you don't see gold two-faces and cherry curls, you're going to realize these brothers ain't wearing fubu like you, man. 
[01:36:00]  Nothing left, huh?  And they'll be back, bro.  Look, man, all it is is this.  America's an awesome country, man.  And you guys, you know, having this radio show, are freeing white people.  Because white people, and not the ones that listen to your show, it's the nice white people, the ones that, you know, when, you know, Mexicans say, hey, man, we're not getting good grades. 
[01:36:30]  Or black people are like, damn, man, why are black people not getting good grades?  It's the nice white people that say, well, we're going to make the test in a bonnet so that you can understand the questions better, thinking that they're doing good.  When in reality, all we're doing is learning black people how to spoke that English, mo, mess it up.  Like, it's not hard enough to get a job when you're black, you know.  Let's teach you how to just walk into a really nice Tane Webber, you know, meeting where you're going to go in there and say, that's right. 
[01:37:00]  You're going to hook a nigga up with a gay-up, hey.  Hey, that's how you're going to get hired in America in the future, you dumbass.  Look, man, for all you people, the reason why I back on you is very simple.  You're all the same.  We're going to know each other better.  What about when we respect each other's differences? 
[01:37:30]  Shut up, stupid.  We're not different.  Just because you eat a cannoli and I eat flan, it doesn't mean we're different.  It means we were both hungry for dessert, you retard.  That flan, though, is a little rough, Carlos.  Well, exactly.  So that's rough for you.  For me, it's perfect because, you know, I grew up eating it.  All right, we've got a Puerto Rican outpissed.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, I'm Spanish.  Spanish is saying, I was born here, and my family is from Spain.  And I get talked, if I say I'm Spanish, nobody says, oh, from Spain? 
[01:38:00]  What part of Spain is your family?  Oh, what part of Puerto Rico?  What part of Mexico are you from?  What part of southern Los Angeles did you come from?  You know, and they don't realize there's a difference between all of this,  and it gets aggravated to us.  But, you know, you can tell the difference between a Puerto Rican and a Mexican  and somebody from Argentina or Venezuela.  Nice.  And they grew up as well into one ignorant bunch of people. 
[01:38:30]  You're on the other side.  You can't tell the difference.  I don't believe that.  You can't tell.  I'm white as white can be.  I can tell the difference between a Mexican and a Puerto Rican.  But when you start getting a Puerto Rican and a Dominican, I have no idea.  You can't tell the difference between a Dominican and a Puerto Rican?  It's about five different shades.  Swear to you.  Yeah, Dominicans are a lot darker than your average.  It's a lot darker over there.  The majority of Dominicans are a lot darker than the majority of the Puerto Rican.  I've seen some dark Puerto Ricans.  And you can't mess with fun.  What are you talking about?  A stick is a stick is a stick. 
[01:39:00]  Let it go.  Puerto Ricans look like the bad guys in movies.  And then the Mexicans look like the little kids running around Sally Struthers.  That's what I'm saying.  Where do we fit in Spain?  Spain?  I don't know.  Spain always comes off, you know, looking good.  Spain does look good.  What do I check?  White or Latin?  Well, if you're from Spain, you should just be a white guy.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  You know, if it wasn't for my ancestors,  none of you guys would be speaking Spanish. 
[01:39:30]  I think it was just Spanish, whatever.  I think you guys became like Spanish,  like you checked Spanish after you guys left Spain and went to other places.  Right.  But you know what?  I understand his anger because people from Spain are European.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So they should be treated like Germans or white people,  but because of Mexicans and Cubans.  No, well, that's what he's saying, though.  But because of Mexicans and Cubans,  we dragged the Spaniards down to the Biner level,  and it's upsetting him.  Ah, poor Spain.  Hey, I mean, we brought the Spanish. 
[01:40:00]  We are Spanish.  We are good people.  We are Antonio Landeras.  Yeah, whatever.  Why don't you play a Mexican in El Mariachi, bitch?  You know what I mean?  Hey, Carlos.  And into my own people, I'm a gringo.  There you go.  It doesn't matter.  I lose either way.  I'm screwed.  Hey, thank you, Joe.  Half brief.  All right.  Bye.  Hey, Carlos.  Yeah.  It's known that my girlfriend is 100% Puerto Rican.  I've been going out with her for many years, right?  Right.  She finally told me that, well, she's actually from Spain.  So I'm like, what?  I'm like, screw that Puerto Rican crap. 
[01:40:30]  I'm going to start telling everyone you're Spanish.  Spanish, stop, because it sounds so much cooler.  What's Spain, right?  No, don't say she's Spanish, though.  If you really want people to, like, look at her differently, and I'm serious about this.  I know what you're going to say.  Tell everyone she's Italian.  No, just say she's from Spain.  Because that was an eye-opener.  When I started dating her, I thought the whole time she was Italian.  I had to take that big gulp, but I'm like, oh, you're Puerto Rican.  Okay, that changes things. 
[01:41:00]  The big gulp, oh, man.  I'm like, well, from my neighborhood, you know, we're not used to going out with Puerto Ricans.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Very white neighborhood.  Yeah, but it's the best sex you've ever had.  Ah, hell yeah.  So I'm doing the lawn in Santa Porta.  And the best fight you've ever had.  Right?  Fight?  You had the best fights with her and the best sex.  Carlos, you missed the beginning of the show.  The best fight ever was against a French guy underwater, 60 feet. 
[01:41:30]  No way.  I swear to God, on vacation.  The French guy.  On vacation.  We told this whole story to begin the show, but on vacation, I was scuba diving 60 feet under the water,  and I punched a French guy in the head.  A French guy?  Yep.  That's good.  Me can all.  I don't like those little fag French people, anyway.  I think all races can unite in the hatred of the French.  I agree.  See, and that's what I was going to get to earlier, that when we realize that it's okay to hate each other in this country, 
[01:42:00]  that's when we're going to be better off.  Right.  Yeah.  There you go.  We're not trying to be nice to each other, you know what I mean?  Like, I saw a white guy the other day go to a McDonald's and get really bad service,  and it happened to be like a white kid that gave him the service, and he walked out,  and I guess he checked what he got, and he got the wrong thing, and he walked back in,  and he had this pissed off face, like, I'm going to tell these people off.  When he came back in, the white guy was in the back, and it was a black guy in the front,  and he didn't want to tell him, you screwed up my order.  Right.  So he just kind of, like, started looking and looking and waited, and then he just grabbed his bag and left. 
[01:42:30]  And I knew that he was intimidated by the fact that the guy was black.  You know what I mean?  That he didn't want to say, like, hey, get my stuff,  because he was afraid the black guy would have been like, oh, you just want the black guy.  You just want the negative guy.  If you're white, if you get bad service from a black guy or a Puerto Rican, tell him.  I ordered a number one, not a number two.  I don't care.  I don't have to say it in Spanish.  Get my crap.  I don't know.  I'd rather have white spit on my food, Carlos. 
[01:43:00]  Carlos, that's why I'll just tell the white guy, because you know they're going to spit on it,  no matter what color they are.  Who cares, though?  Don't eat it.  Just make them do it right.  You know, I swear to God, that happened to me.  See, I was at Taco Bell with my white friend, and we ordered stuff, and I just wanted one.  I wanted a bean and cheese burrito with no onion.  It's not like I even asked the guy to do extra.  I actually made his job easier, because they normally go and reach for the onions and scoop it. 
[01:43:30]  I said, cut that part of your job out.  I'm going to make it easier.  Of course, I opened it up, and there's onions in there.  And I go, I'm going to get another one in, my white friend.  He's going to spit in it.  He's going to spit in it.  And I was like, I don't care.  And I looked at him, and I said, I told you in Spanish, no cebolla.  I told you in English, no onions.  I know you're not French, so your ass understood me.  Take this back.  Put it in wherever you put it, and give me one with no onion.  And he was looking at me funny, like he might spit in my food.  And I said, listen, I don't care.  If I open up that burrito and I see a big loogie, I'm not going to be pissed, 
[01:44:00]  as long as there are no freaking onions in it.  Hey, Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys, welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey, Carlos.  Yo.  One thing for you, man.  Next time somebody gets hung up on being Italian-American or Mexican-American,  you ask them if Italy or Mexico declares war on the United States, who were they rooting for?  Oh, good question.  Oh, yeah, I've already asked people like that.  I'll tell you straight up.  If Mexico were to ever be stupid enough to go to war against the United States of America, 
[01:44:30]  pay attention, my people.  I will show you ways to cross that border you never knew existed.  We will hunt that bitch down to him.  All right, one more, and we've got to let you go.  Someone's calling you a sellout.  Terry from Harlem.  Beautiful.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Terry.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Yo, Carlos, I want to tell you, D. You're a total sellout, bro.  Let me tell you why.  You know what?  I agree with a lot of things you say, man.  You know, I'm not with the whole PC thing. 
[01:45:00]  So the cat called up before and was like, oh, African-Americans started separating the two names.  No, we were the last ones.  The first ones were the immigrants that came over.  So we were left out there.  Not me, though.  He said that.  No, you won't.  Yeah, listen.  I don't mind if you blast people, but then when somebody's straight up wrong, tell them about themselves.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't think Carlos said that.  I think it was either a...  Yeah, it was the guy that said that, not me.  Yeah, it was a caller, I believe.  Yeah, I know, but I'm saying Carlos was totally kissing the guys behind, oh, yeah, yeah, you're right. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, black guy started.  Trust me, the black guys are always at the bottom end.  We don't have much of a choice.  All right.  Terry, let Carlos say something.  First of all, bro, I'm not black, so I don't know all of your history.  If you call and correct me on something, I ain't going to be mad at you.  You're going to call me a sellout.  You're going to call me a sellout for like a few reasons, not because I made a little  mistake.  You're kissing the behind of the first white guy that calls up and says this.  Oh, hell no, I don't get this, that's all I'm saying. 
[01:46:00]  Expose them.  Let me tell you who's ass I kiss.  And this is the only ass I kiss.  I kiss the ass of America, of the white men, all right, those white men a long time ago  that had wooden teeth, that had slaves, yet were smart enough to put a document that  said, all men are created equal, so that one day your people could say, even though I'm  black or Negro, whatever you want to call me, I'm a man.  That means I can vote.  We would call three-fifths of a man.  It means that a six-fifths of a man, total man, what are you talking about? 
[01:46:30]  No, no, no.  That's not an American document.  It's not?  It's not?  It's not?  No, no, no.  That comes from the Catholic Church that says white people were so human.  Oh, no, no, it doesn't, bro, bro.  Bro, bro, bro.  You read it.  Where does it say that?  Where does it say that in the Constitution of the United States of America?  What was the document written before the Constitution?  I don't want to get into a whole political debate.  I'm kidding.  I like you a lot, Carlos.  The Declaration of Independence.  Yeah, in the Declaration. 
[01:47:00]  All right, I'm sorry.  No, no, I'm just saying, it's not that.  I'm not mad, bro.  What I'm saying is that, look, there have been racist people in this country.  You and I can agree on that.  Uh-huh.  But this is not a racist country.  No, I hate you.  Listen, listen, I got love for everybody.  You know what I'm saying?  Black, white, I really don't care.  Terry, let him finish his thoughts, though.  Okay, I'm sorry.  And all I'm saying is, is that, listen, America, right, even though it's had bad things happen 
[01:47:30]  and mean people in it and whatever, we do really well, man.  I mean, when was the last time that you heard that a black guy got, 90% of black people are  killed by black people.  You're right on with that.  90% of Hispanics are killed by Hispanics.  Yet all we do is talk about white people.  But you know what?  Why not black crime nowadays?  It doesn't happen like it used to.  But you go to Africa, dude, genocide.  You go to Mexico, genocide.  We know the same language, talk the same stuff. 
[01:48:00]  And like we want to do is get pissed at each other.  And I'm just saying, man, if America was really racist, Carlos Mencia wouldn't be on  Opie and Anthony, man.  And he wouldn't be selling out and selling albums and none of that crap, dude.  I hate you, bro.  That's not right.  And to tell you a story, bro, when Def Jam first came out, when it first came out, the  first season, I got a phone call from Def Jam.  I never tell this story, but I tell you so you get it.  I got a call from Def Jam. 
[01:48:30]  They said, hey, man, we heard you're really funny and you really do well with the black  crowds.  We want you to perform.  And you can call people and ask them.  I performed that Maverick flag.  They put me on first.  I got a standing ovation.  Nobody was able to top what I did that night.  They called me the next day and said, hey, man, we're sorry, but we thought about it and  we're not going to put you on, you know, Def Jam because you're not black and we don't  really want to open that kind of worms.  But was that a black thing or an HBO thing?  That was a black thing.  That came from, you know, basically the heads up. 
[01:49:00]  It wasn't HBO because HBO at the time had a deal with me and it was in their best interest  to do so.  Now, I'm saying that anybody's racist or nothing like that.  I can understand that they didn't want to go to that kind of worms and they wanted it  to stay black and all that.  But my point is, is that that stuff gets perpetrated on people all the time.  You know what I mean?  There's racist in every end of every culture.  There's racist everywhere.  Terry, we're going to cut you off.  All right, fellas.  Our founding fathers were not racist.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Our founding fathers were visionaries.  All right.  Thank you, Terry.  Carlos, we're going to let you go.  We're really late.  Oh, I'm sorry, man.  No, you did very well.  Thanks, bro.  CarlosMencia.com, right?  Yeah, CarlosMencia.com.  M-E-N, not M-A-N.  M-E-N-C-I-A.  Right.  And you're going to be calling us more often, hopefully?  Dude, I'm going to be calling you like once a week on Friday to do like a weekend update  and, you know, I'll do a few minutes on whatever went down that week.  And I promise, dude, I've just been so busy, man. 
[01:50:00]  And then my father-in-law had like a heart attack slash other things, so I've been having  to fly up there to Oregon with my girlfriend.  All right, no problem.  It's been hectic, bro, but I miss you guys, man, as you can see.  Yeah, cool.  Keep in touch, and we'll talk to you soon.  All right, buddy.  Rick wants to say hey, all right?  All right.  CarlosMencia, everyone.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  And we'll be back.  O.P.  Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  107.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW is...  The Sport Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  O.P. and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  It's the Radio Chick.  Here, Jack.  You're on with the Radio Chick.  My wife and I have been married for almost two years now.  Every single part of our relationship is 50-50, and it all starts from decent and a ball  Kristen on the top across me, and I'm talking about her at that.  Oh, wow.  Wait a minute.  You crap in front of your wife? 
[01:51:00]  Absolutely.  She crap in front of me.  Oh, you guys are sick.  Oh, no.  That's not right, David.  Listen, if you can't be open in every single part of your house, every single part of your  relationship...  Wait.  If you say open, you mean every or of it?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Radio Chick, weekdays, 9 to noon, 1027, WNEW.  Catch the best of O.P. and Anthony, Saturdays, 11 to 3, 1027, WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony, all owned by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[01:51:30]  This is 1027, WNEW.  This radio stage is becoming one big, long promo.  That's right.  There's promos after promos.  If you don't know what the lineup of WNEW is at this point, it's not going to make a difference.  Right.  So wait until it changes again, and then do the promos again.  There were like five promos during that commercial break. 
[01:52:00]  Just wait a couple of months, and then there'll be a whole bunch of new promos.  Sports guys, and then the chick is back.  The chick's been back for five months.  O.P. and Anthony now doing worse stuff.  How do you keep track of this if you're in your car?  You can't.  It's basic programming, too, because it adds to the commercial breaks.  It makes them a lot longer, which means it gives people a chance to go somewhere else  and see if anything else is interesting going on the radio dial somewhere else. 
[01:52:30]  Radio dial.  Ouch.  Enough with the promos.  The one promo that drives me nuts where they give the whole lineup?  Yeah.  And it just goes on.  Like you just took a speed reading course?  Yeah.  Sports guys, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  O.P. and Anthony, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Two douchebags a night, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then they go, O.P. and Anthony, and then there's like a 40-second promo for our show.  Yeah.  Very long. 
[01:53:00]  People don't want to think when they listen to the radio.  Yeah.  Holy ass.  What's the significance of telling everyone we're on weekends now at the end of our commercial breaks?  Telling them so they tune in on the weekend.  We'll tell our listeners.  I couldn't tell you.  Right around Thursday or Friday, we'll go, oh, guys, guess what?  In case you missed this killer bit, maybe O.P.'s underwater fight from earlier this week, we're going to replay it Saturday when we do our Worst of Show 11 to 3. 
[01:53:30]  I don't even know when we're on.  Oh, 11 to 3?  Yeah.  I can't keep track of Saturdays.  I turn it on, I'm like, who's here?  What?  Who's on now?  What?  No one is sitting there with a notepad and a piece of paper writing all this crap down.  Radio's very basic.  You tune it on.  You tune it in.  Something interesting is happening.  You're going to stay there and listen for a while.  Maybe after a while, if that same shift is giving you something day in and day out, you're going to go, oh, wow, I want to listen to O.P. and Anthony.  I know when they're on.  Sure.  But they're not sitting there like, well, I've got to check out the sports guys.  They're on from 5.30 to 9, I think. 
[01:54:00]  Then the radio check out at 9 to noon.  And then Ron and Fez, noon to 3.  And then O.P.  And I begged them.  I said, please, enough with the promos.  There's too many promos.  And the chick is back, okay?  Everyone knows that by now.  Oh, no, the rack is back.  So then you're not even telling the people who the rack is.  And then you need a whole promo to tell people who the rack is because you're not seeing the radio check.  Should the promo saying that someone's back air for a longer time than they were gone? 
[01:54:30]  Simple formula.  If someone's gone for a week, the promo runs a week saying that someone's back.  If someone's gone two weeks, how come someone was gone, you know, the chick was gone how long?  Two weeks.  The rack is back.  It's been running four months.  At least.  At least.  Oh, my God. 
[01:55:00]  Enough with the promo.  We're not playing.  We're playing one promo per commercial break starting now.  That's it.  New rule.  New rule.  That means we have to get rid of the three of ours that run during the commercial.  We're on right now.  We don't need to tell people we're on right now.  They know because we're here.  So we'll run one.  I'll hear that, too, when I'm listening to other shows.  Like, I think I heard on the radio check they do the whole lineup.  Yeah.  And then they go, the radio check.  And then it's a promo for the radio check show.  She's on the air. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  She's on the air.  You don't have to promote because she's already on the air at that time when the promo's running.  That's basics.  No reason.  Basics.  Yeah.  I wonder if the news station will get it.  What?  What?  Why is everyone walking out of the studio?  What happened?  Shahid, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How you been, man?  All right, Shahid.  All right.  Yeah.  You know what?  Yeah, yeah.  Check this out.  I'm glad you guys brought up this topic, man. 
[01:56:00]  You called down at Mike Douchebags.  What's up?  I thought you guys were friends.  What?  What happened there?  What?  I thought you guys, I couldn't do friends tonight.  Oh, I don't think he said Don and Mike were doing that.  Well, he probably didn't say it by name, but I heard that.  Wow.  Yeah, come on.  Yeah, check it out, though, man.  Can I ask one question?  No, I'll tell you why, because their true colors are coming to the surface.  Anyone else pick up on the fact that those two douchebags came to New York when Anthony 
[01:56:30]  and I go on vacation?  Yeah, we're out of the military.  And management doesn't even have the balls to tell us that Don and Mike are coming to  town while we're on vacation?  Yeah.  It's like, what is this?  It's like a goddamn retard school.  What else?  They weren't there?  Oh, we are.  Oh, God.  We're getting dumped.  Why are we getting dumped?  We're getting dumped out of.  Wow.  This isn't even going through.  Why are we getting dumped?  Hey, well, you know what?  Glad to hear you guys back. 
[01:57:00]  Thanks, man.  All right.  All right, Shahid.  What part got dumped?  Everything.  Anything mentioning somebody else.  But not the somebody else that we can't mention.  It's some other we can't mention somebody else.  See, and I love that when people call the group, you guys are bitches.  Why don't you talk about this person or that person?  Because we can't.  See, we just try talking about other people and we get them.  No, we can.  Yes, Eddie?  That somebody else that you're talking about, I just heard in the other room, will be here 
[01:57:30]  live next week as well.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  So they're going to make that old horse run.  Good.  There we go.  That ought to be fun.  Fight.  If we can only get 60 feet underwater next week.  See how Opie does it.  Their true colors pop out all the time.  They decide to come back to New York while we're on vacation.  I'll just say it ten times until we run out of delay.  And we'll go to Van Halen.  Yeah.  Want to play a game?  What? 
[01:58:00]  Let's play a little game.  Okay.  You can take bets at home because I want to say something, okay?  Will the Van Halen music come on?  John.  Poor John.  I'm back.  Do you know who's running the dump?  We can talk about that.  Do you know who's running the dump for one day?  Who's out there waving hands?  I can't see.  Jeremy's panicking now.  Why are you panicking?  Does Jeremy have the face on through the glass like he did when Psycho Mark was in the boss's office?  No, that was a different face.  Why are you panicking?  I'm not panicking.  Is there a list of names we're not allowed to talk about? 
[01:58:30]  Is the list getting larger?  No.  Why did they come in broadcast while we were on vacation?  Because it's the spring book now.  They'll be up again in two weeks.  All right.  They will be up again in two weeks.  Hmm.  So how about that Tiger Woods?  Did that just get dumped out?  What?  Did they're coming up in two weeks?  Or are you going to run down the hall and dump out on yourself for saying that?  Welcome back.  There we go. 
[01:59:00]  Leave so we can talk about you.  Oh, Jesus.  Jeremy was nice enough to get us lunch tonight.  Of course.  See?  We're not going to make believe we're happy with them.  Jeremy's like one of the parents in those families that are so completely dysfunctional.  You know, the son's a drag queen that does heroin.  The daughter's just a suck slut.  And you just sit down.  I want to have dinner together. 
[01:59:30]  We are one happy family.  Like not even realizing the reality of the situation, you know?  You're like that poor parent that thinks everything's fine and hunky-dory.  Or wants it to be.  It is nothing like that.  Yes, it is.  This family's on crack.  You guys are all great guys.  You get along swell and you play ball together.  This whole family's on crack.  Jeremy, we're not your friend.  We use you for free lunch.  That hurt. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Can you explain the promos?  It's driving us nuts.  Can I explain the promos?  Yeah, the last commercial break we played, I think, a promo for every show.  We had a radio chick promo.  A sports guy starburst.  Starburst?  What's a starburst?  Starburst is a real short one.  Oh.  It's fun, guys.  It's funny.  And then a promo for the fact that we're doing weekends.  Cool.  Isn't that a little confusing to the listener? 
[02:00:30]  What?  To promote that we have something on in the morning for people to listen to and then something  on in the early midday and the late midday and something on after you and something on  on the weekend?  Thank you.  Just saying it like that.  No one can keep up with that.  What's that?  I missed it.  That's why we have to keep saying it over and over again.  Oh, God.  Listen to the sports guys in the morning.  Then the radio chick.  Then Ron and Finn.  Why don't we just have one long promo and then no one has to do a radio show?  We have those as well.  Oh.  We'll just give the illusion that there's something really good happening at the station. 
[02:01:00]  We'll just have a promo that just goes 24 hours a day and no one has to show up  to work.  You know, the promos would all get along with each other.  Is the rack back still running?  Yeah.  When did that stop?  It was the second you turned your back and went on vacation.  Did it?  When did it stop, Steve?  You know.  Steve?  We were playing it the week before we went on vacation.  And we were just like, oh, my God.  We were playing it right up until we left for vacation.  We're like, what?  I can't understand.  She's like we said, you know, the saying you're back should never last longer than you 
[02:01:30]  were actually gone.  You know?  It's like.  It may have run a few times while you guys were on break.  I'm not sure.  And, you know.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You want to go down the hall so you can, like, hit the dump button?  What?  Vacation.  We just got back and we're already freaking out.  This is coming from a reliable source.  Don and Mike were making fun of WOW.  They were pretending to be gay.  And in gay voices, they said they were doing a new radio promotion called Whip It Out Wednesday. 
[02:02:00]  That's a reliable source?  Yep.  Yeah.  This guy?  Without a doubt, it's a reliable source.  Oh.  Who I just read it from.  So they can make fun of us, but we can't make fun of that.  Let me see the name on that.  It's a reliable source.  It's family.  Oh.  Of course.  Say hi.  Uh, Bambi, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask a question to Jeremy, that punk-ass bitch.  Hey, hey, douchebag.  Why don't you go back to Australia?  The station runs better without you, you jerk.  Oh, wow. 
[02:02:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  Where's your balls, huh?  All right.  Thank you for being me.  What?  Gary, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, man.  This guy, Jeremy, man.  Don and Mike are horrible.  They're not funny.  As soon as you guys leave, I have to turn the radio off.  I can't stand it.  Ron and Fez are great, though.  I've got to give them that much to switch on that time, because I listen to that now.  We have no problem with Ron Fez.  We fully support their radio show.  Yeah, but man, it's horrible.  There is no humor whatsoever in Don and Mike. 
[02:03:00]  Jeremy, are you listening?  Huh?  I don't think you heard that.  He's cowering in the corner, sucking his thumb right now.  Let him cow, buddy.  They're two washed-up old guys, man.  All right.  All right, thanks.  All right.  That's St. John, three to seven.  John, what's up?  Harold Miller.  Is anybody like Don and Mike?  Is it possible that anyone likes that show?  Don likes himself so much, that's all that matters.  It's him tonight.  Even the promos that you guys play when they play those little bits from the show, it drives me insane. 
[02:03:30]  I have to change the radio station.  That's a funny line, Jeremy.  It's all in fun.  It's all good.  It's all camaraderie and fun between radio shows, right?  Right?  That's a funny line.  Don likes himself enough.  All right, good.  Take care.  All right, John.  Jeremy, I understand.  See, now, Opie, Jeremy's in a very bad position right here.  Because there were discussions a while back, you might remember, that certain radio shows here on NAW were upset that they were being spoken about in a bad light by this very program. 
[02:04:00]  So something was said that no one was to speak of anybody.  Mm-hmm.  Now, this is putting Jeremy in a bad position because while we were gone, they were talking and saying things about this very program.  And we're fine with that.  They weren't.  No?  No.  Okay.  Well, I'll get some proof for it.  All right.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Well, nothing was said.  Because we'll adhere to any rule.  We're so good like that.  But the second it gets broken on the other side, the floodgate opens.  That's right.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I've been waiting patiently for this day for two, I think, and a half years.  And I've got to tell you something.  Listen, I call a lot of times.  I've met you guys, XFL, all that stuff.  Ron and Fez, awesome, before you guys.  The rest of this stuff blows. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, man.  Say that.  Stand up for yourself.  Oh, that's a very strong word.  Yeah.  Puerto Rico or Los Angeles, Anthony?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  Later, boys.  Let's go to Don.  I think we're playing Make Jeremy Cry.  Oh, yeah.  I want to ask, Don.  How you doing?  I want to ask, Jeremy, why Ron and Fez were saying that Jeremy hates them now.  I mean, they're the only other good show besides Opie and Anthony on this radio station.  And why are they feeling that they're not getting their show now? 
[02:05:30]  I think everyone is supporting Ron and Fez at this point.  Yeah, they're saying that management hates them now or something like that, though.  Like they're the most hated radio show there by management.  Well, we've got to stick with the facts.  I don't think that's true.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  Well, a little tense in the room?  I don't know.  Is it tense, Jeremy?  Is it tense, Jeremy?  Yes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right. 
[02:06:00]  We'll take another call, then.  I love this.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  One tell-all that shows how bad Don and Mike suck is the fact that all of their promos,  it's never them talking.  It's always like a caller saying something funny.  It's not them.  They're horrible.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, there you go.  All right.  See, this is creating talk, though, Jeremy.  You know that.  Yeah.  In the radio business, now a lot of people are going to check out Don and Mike.  I don't feel like talking.  Don and Mike.  And it's cool because then someone either quits for like a week or gets fired for like two 
[02:06:30]  weeks or refuses to go on the air for a couple of days.  And then it creates talk and the press gets talking.  And they say, yeah, it's good.  Right?  I think.  Right?  Good?  Good.  You got them pretty wound up there, Ovi.  You want to take another call?  No.  I'm going.  Bye.  Oh, boy.  Now there's an after show meeting.  See?  Opie, you reined it.  I don't think so. 
[02:07:00]  Bobby's saying, pants them.  Pants them.  We're going to settle our differences underwater.  Get a tank.  We need a huge 60-foot tank so we can do some slow-mo scuba battles.  Underwater fight club.  Wow.  What just happened?  I'm losing my...  Oh, stop, Rick.  Go out there and just make sure...  Make sure Bob...  Oh, Jeremy's okay.  I slip like that for him. 
[02:07:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Make sure Jeremy's okay.  Game over, Opie made Pip cry.  Whee!  How much longer have...  Oh, wait.  Yeah.  How long have Ron and Fez been new to midday? 
[02:08:00]  Since January.  Right.  Steven, what's up?  You guys, I got to agree with that guy that says he's been waiting for this day.  You guys roll that effing station, man.  No one else should even have air time.  I don't even know why they play any other shows.  No, no, no.  I get Don and Mike.  Don and Mike, blow me.  They're horrible.  Horrible.  You shouldn't take F of anybody in that station.  You guys, fully power that station.  All right.  Start playing what you guys...  Play the games you want to play. 
[02:08:30]  F everybody else.  I'm out of here.  All right.  Thank you, Steven.  Hmm.  Okay.  Look at that.  Want to lock the studio door?  Are we going to the mattresses?  The mattresses.  Everything's fine.  Always sucks after we do a break like this and we have to, like, leave the studio and get  a little awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Once the show's over, it gets really awkward.  I know when it gets awkward is when Stinky decides to seek refuge in the studio. 
[02:09:00]  Stinky is in the studio.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Doesn't even want to go outside.  All right.  That's okay.  We'll be very concerned with the walk up the hallway until we shut our office door and  start cracking some beer.  Yeah.  And everything's right back to normal.  Right.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Good one.  Don't we usually F up real bad before vacation?  We haven't F'd up. 
[02:09:30]  This is a new trend.  We haven't F'd up.  In our eyes, we haven't.  I think people are angry now.  Okay.  Let's take a break and regroup.  Okay, Anthony?  All right.  He's waiting to come back down the hall.  He's just waiting at the end of the hallway for us to hit those commercials.  There's another five promos on the way.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  A few promos and a few commercials and we'll be back.  The L.P. has absolutely shown.

Dennis and I, we haven't taken a show together since Tampa in December, but I do remember 
[02:10:30]  that he was looking pretty good at the time.  So Vinci Lopez is now like a fish market?  Oh, no, no.  I wouldn't say that.  You know, I mean, that's going too far, you know, for this family show.  The Don and Mike Show, weeknights, WNEW.  Anthony, stay tuned for the Ron and Fez Starburst.

[02:12:30]  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're listening.  No, not Anthony Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice.  And you're listening to Opie and the guy that wants to be me show on WNEW 102.7.  Hey, what's your name?  Hey, Dice will be in studio sometime this week. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, no.  Playing Westbury Music Fair in the round.  You're not going to warn everybody on the day?  On Long Island this weekend.  Looking forward to the show and looking forward to Dice coming through those studio doors.  John, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  All right, first off, I want to come off by saying I listen to your show all the time and you guys are very good.  But I got a little bit of a problem with you today.  All right.  I listen to Don and Mike and I happen to like them. 
[02:13:30]  I think their show is very good.  Okay.  And to hear you guys coming off, you know, basically crying and the little drones that you have calling saying that they're not funny and all of that,  that's probably because they don't have enough intelligence.  All right?  All right.  Well, you know, I'm being fair here, you know.  See, we do that on this show, though.  You're representing the other side of that.  Right.  Exactly right.  I listen to Don and Mike and I think their show is very good and I happen to like it very much. 
[02:14:00]  See, here's the difference.  Here's the difference.  We allow you to speak your mind.  It's not going to hurt us.  Right.  No, I'm not calling up the badmouth, you guys.  You know what?  You can.  I don't care.  No, there's no point.  We allow you guys to do that if you have...  Okay, now, if you're going to break it down...  We'll get to some other cities in a few months.  Okay.  That is a guarantee.  Well, good for you.  All right, John, thank you.  Yeah, okay.  Fight me.  Hey, what happened there? 
[02:14:30]  I thought we were...  You should remind us about 6,000 times and you guys are going to be back on Monday.  I don't think your fans would have known, huh?  But anyway, listen, you guys had an interesting programming concept a while back that I think worked pretty well.  You guys should go back to it.  What's that?  It was eight hours of Opie and Anthony, eight hours of the sports guys, and eight hours of Ron and Fez.  Is that what we were doing for a while?  I don't know.  We suggested a few things.  Throw in the radio chicken there for a couple hours.  You've got a nice chance.  All right, Vito.  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Take care, guys.  All right, they're getting very upset down the hall.  Yeah, I see.  New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.  That's three states, SF.  Oh, we're in three states.  Dan from Hoboken.  The guy goes, New York, that's one state.  I think you could squeeze Pennsylvania in there, too.  Parts of it, sure.  So we're in four states.  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  And in two countries.  Because we're in Queens. 
[02:15:30]  Wonderful.  Okay.  All right, let's calm down.  All right, let's move on.  Yeah.  All right.  Find a better subject to talk about.  Why don't we...  It's been a little more entertaining.  Let's see.  Why don't we clear the phone lines?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, we'll give out some Dice tickets, okay?  When it receives a pair of tickets...  Hey, hey, hey, what did the listeners do?  Come on, man.  Nice clay. 
[02:16:00]  Friday, Westbury Music Fair.  Tickets on sale now through Ticketmaster.  The 10th caller gets a pair of tickets.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, right?  Yeah.  2-1-2-1?  We'll give away two pairs of tickets, yes.  To two random callers.  Well, 10th and whatever you want to do.  Blah, blah, blah.  There we go.  Ben, you got to get...  Oh, okay, Ben, get over there.  One of the biggest stories while we were on vacation was the homeless guy taking his homeless feces.  Yeah, and feces and urine. 
[02:16:30]  And urine.  If one isn't bad enough.  And putting it in the buffets that I think every New Yorker has eaten at least once.  Mm-hmm.  And they caught the guy, and everyone is very relieved that they finally caught this guy.  Yeah.  He was doing it in one place, two places, three places, and a bunch.  That was in the 30s on 7th Avenue.  It was a bunch.  Look, this...  I heard this story.  This guy would walk in with this little bottle, a spray bottle, and start spraying the buffet-style food with a mixture of his crap and wee. 
[02:17:00]  And a few places said, I saw the news story last night.  And a few places were like, yeah, well, somebody come in and spray something.  It smelled really bad.  And then he turned around and he gone, but left a bad smell.  You know what I took away from that?  They did nothing.  Of course not.  The woman that was talking was like, okay, the guy came in.  He smelled really...  She goes, he smelled really bad. 
[02:17:30]  And we started smelling all this bad smell.  And then I looked at this man.  He looked at me and walked away.  She didn't say, we then closed down this place immediately and went through the food to see if it was the smell coming off of the stuff he sprayed.  Because she never saw him spray something.  She just thought it was his own odor.  So they just sold the food.  And you know something?  That's what was happening at all these places.  Maybe the little spray would happen, but it's not like, oh, my God, rope it off now.  Not until he was arrested.  People were eating at these places and ingesting... 
[02:18:00]  The homeless guy.  Like, that makes it worse.  Yeah.  Oh, well, if it was Trump crapping on our buffets...  Right, it was urinating.  It would have a lovely taste to it.  Although, if Britney Spears, let's say, was going around urinating on the other day, I'd be in line for some of that broccoli.  I'd eat the corn in her...  See, right.  Remember that old joke.  You'd eat the corn off doing good shots of it.  Hey, Britney, come on.  It's on tap.  But, you know, the news people have to make it sound worse. 
[02:18:30]  It was not just a regular New Yorker.  It was a homeless guy.  Feces and urine from...  Oh, my God.  A homeless man.  A homeless man.  Horrid.  Can't they just stick to whapping you over the head with a goddamn brick?  At least you see that.  You know what happens.  How do you...  It's covert homeless crap.  My God.  Well, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Well, let me tell the people something, and I hope you're smart enough to realize this.  A lot of people now, very relieved because they caught the guy. 
[02:19:00]  Relieved, Opie.  That's funny.  They're very relieved that they caught the guy.  Right.  So, no more homeless feces and urine in the buffets.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let me tell you guys something.  Mm-hmm.  You think this is the only guy that has done this?  Do you?  And you think it takes like a nut, homeless nut who babbles to himself to just go ahead and go through this?  No.  It takes maybe an irate customer.  Maybe someone totally sane that got bad service and figures he's going to blow a snot rocket into your chow mein. 
[02:19:30]  I used to eat at the buffets at the delis and stuff.  Mm-hmm.  I used to pay in a moment.  Well, that's a coincidence.  And I would get these incredible migraine headaches.  Uh-oh.  I was convinced something was trying to bore its way out of my skull.  That's odd.  And guess what?  I stopped eating at those places.  My headache went away.  I can't eat at those buffets. 
[02:20:00]  I don't like eating at those things.  Because of that reason.  Oh, my God.  The sacred sneeze guard over the top.  Thank God the health department enacted that one.  So in case you sneeze, you're going to sneeze on half the food that's exposed under the sneeze guard.  These people that want to do something to the food, there's plenty of room.  I've seen some stuff around those buffet things.  It horrifies you.  Screw the sneeze guard.  There's guys that will, you know, in the middle of winter, they've got their cold.  Oh, they're wiping their mouth. 
[02:20:30]  And then they're picking up the strawberries.  Because the little, like, tongs can't pick up enough strawberries.  So they're like, screw that.  And they just reach in for their strawberries.  Dude, even if they're using the tongs, he still touched the tongs with his snotty hand.  Or the bathroom guys that don't wipe, don't wash their hand.  If they're wiping or holding their junk, you're one degree of separation away from a BJ.  Right there.  You're eating some young guy when you're going to get your chow mein. 
[02:21:00]  But a lot of people are relieved because they caught the whole, don't kid yourself.  There's a lot of this stuff going on.  It happens.  And this is just touching the tip of the iceberg.  And they went through a bunch of the restaurants last night on the news story.  And I just pictured being arrested.  If you're a restaurant owner, and you're sitting there watching this news story, you're just,  here comes the next one.  No, no.  Thank God it wasn't me.  Oh, Jesus.  And the guys that do on these places, that's the last thing you want to say. 
[02:21:30]  The last reason you want to be on the news is because somebody defecated and urinated on your food.  You know, who's going to go to that place?  Where is it?  7th and 39th?  Yeah, it's in the 30s somewhere.  It's in the 30s on 7th.  And I'm thinking, like, who's going to go there?  Regardless, they catch the guy they want.  Did they boil everything?  Did they sit there and decontaminate every inch of that place? 
[02:22:00]  No.  So I say it's still contaminated.  In my book, in my humble opinion, you won't see me eating at a buffet.  And you know something?  I know things just as bad are going on in kitchens all over me.  You've got some funky-tasting stuff.  Oh.  Oh, well, thank God he didn't mix that in.  Does it matter at that point?  Like that never happened before?  Oh, my God.  By the way, this is very inside but very funny. 
[02:22:30]  We have our old dump guy back today, John.  Yeah.  Who now works for the radio chick.  Who's back, by the way?  The rack is back.  I guess you did not.  So we got instant feedback.  Name, John.  Email, dump guy.  From down the hall.  You couldn't wait until the mom wants to do this crap.  Yeah.  He's like under.  We are effing him up.  He has had the easiest ride.  He's back one day with us, and we have completely effed him up. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, poor John.  Dropped a little bomb.  He's back there with a vodka.  I think it's kind of around now.  Hey, Bill.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, I used to be an assistant chef at a wedding hall, and you know when the bathrooms were  above the kitchen, and you know when a toilet overflows, sometimes it can seep through the  floor, and if you're under it, the ceiling collects all the water droplets, you know?  So as we're cooking, we get this urine from an overflowing toilet falling on top of us. 
[02:23:30]  The executive chef did not want us to throw out the food because we were about to go up  with dinner.  Pretty sick.  A little extra sodium in the food, I guess, huh?  A little extra iron.  There you go.  I worked at Chicago Pizza Pub, Opie, out on Long Island.  You know where that is.  Mm-hmm.  It's a closed...  No, that was out in Colmack.  That's a...  I think it's a Chinese restaurant now.  It's a Chinese restaurant now, a sushi place.  It used to be an Italian Chicago Pizza Pub.  And it would be a Japanese restaurant. 
[02:24:00]  Right?  Oh, yes, yes.  I know the difference.  Some Chinese restaurants, though, do serve the sushi.  Yeah.  A little strange.  It's a Jap place.  Sushi, but Japanese places don't serve the lo mein.  Sometimes they do both.  Right.  Can't fly a plane, but they can figure out how the hell to get that two-nationality food going.  They...  At Chicago Pizza Pub, the toilet backed up.  Again, like this guy was saying, the whole septic system backed up into the basement where 
[02:24:30]  the food was stored.  So the owner of this place just tells all of us scrub employees, throw pallets on the  floor so you can skip, like friggin' Yosemite Sam going back to the ship for matches.  Now I gotta go back to the ship and get another match.  Well, why don't you grab all the matches, Yosemite Sam?  I'm free and I figured that.  So you throw the pallets down just so we can go and get the food.  So you don't have to walk in the feces. 
[02:25:00]  Right.  Which was floating big biscuits, big puffy brown biscuits floating on the surface and  we were down there taking up food, spaghetti and macaroni and whatever other dried foods  and canned foods that were down there bringing them up and using them.  They were floating in crap.  And people have probably eaten there. 
[02:25:30]  I'm sure.  Yep.  So it happens in restaurants, but the thing is, you don't really know about it.  Right.  That's the only difference.  Somehow that's fine.  Stalker Patty.  Hi, how you doing?  You were talking about...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You didn't take your own life while we were on vacation, I say, huh?  No.  Why?  Did you wish I did?  No.  But what I wanted to say was, I really think they should...  Feisty.  What?  This chick is getting feisty.  I like it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, I just wanted to say they shouldn't have allowed those open... 
[02:26:00]  Oh, oh, Faye.  I threw away.  Oh, Faye.  She might have had something good.  I don't know what happened to the phone.  Oh, you sure you didn't hang up on her or just disconnected?  See, now you're playing a gag.  The whole Stalker Patty phone call was on the air.  Jeremy dumped out because she mentioned you-know-what.  Oh, okay.  So they dumped out of that.  That's what I say.  They must have tweaked her meds. 
[02:26:30]  Fred, what's going on?  Brett, I'm sorry.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, what's up, dude?  A long time ago when I graduated in 91, my senior year, my friend Dove put his girlfriend's  bloody tampon in a salad bar.  Oh, nice.  They threw out the whole goddamn salad.  They chopped it.  That's when they catch you.  I'm telling you, this stuff happens all the time.  Dude, they used to do crazy, radical things to the lunch.  All the time to the lunches.  If there was hamburgers on a shelf, you'd pull one off, you'd have to put snot rockets  underneath the bun and close it down. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Didn't we all see on Fox when chefs go bad or whatever that one was?  This happens all the time.  Guy peeing in the coffee pot.  Ugh.  Nasty stuff, man.  Nasty stuff.  Give me the numbers.  Worse would be number one.  Second worst, number two.  Number three.  All right.  As far as bodily fluids, the worst has got to be what?  What?  See, I know, I think this is a trick question.  I'm not, I'm not falling. 
[02:27:30]  No, no, no.  I'm saying, I'm really saying, all right, you got the, here are your bodily fluids to choose  from.  All right.  You got man gunk.  Okay?  See, if I don't say man gunk, then you're going to say fat.  Let me just say this.  Let's get rid of man gunk.  No, you got to say, it's a bodily fluid that somebody could put in a buffet.  So it's out there.  Let's just say you got man gunk.  You got feces.  You have urine.  Right?  And then you have snot.  Four items. 
[02:28:00]  One being the worst.  Snot's a piece of cake because we've all eaten snot.  Dude, no.  This is, I am so glad I didn't speak over that because now we have it on tape.  That's a piece of cake.  Dude, no.  No.  I am so skeeved out by snot.  It's ridiculous.  You've never eaten your own snot.  Never.  You're such a liar.  Never.  Never.  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  God, you lie.  Even the Pope has eaten his own snot.  I'll tell you, if I get, the closest I ever came to eat my own snot was nasal drip. 
[02:28:30]  And if I feel something in the back of my throat, you're like, all right, you know, it gets gross.  If it came out of my nose, it is so gone from my body.  I can't even, when I'm blowing my nose, and you get one of those, oh, oh, look, it's a rubber band.  I can't even look at it.  I have to use a tissue and a car pull it out, kind of pull it over.  You're the only one.  Why?  I would bet money that 99.99% of the entire population has eaten their own snot. 
[02:29:00]  Dude, wait.  Out of nose, into mouth.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Never.  Never.  Never.  Ever.  How about when you were, like, in third grade, when it was cool?  Out of the womb.  Never have done it.  Ever, ever, ever.  I am, I can't deal with that.  So you're putting that at the top of the list, like, at the bottom of the list, where it wouldn't be that bad.  Out of the other choices? 
[02:29:30]  Well, out of the other choices?  Out of the other choices, that's a piece of cake.  That's a piece of cake.  You're talking, you're talking.  Right, right.  Urine.  All right.  Urine, man, gunk, and feces.  Out of the choices, I guess it would have to be four, but it's a very, hey, it's a bad fourth.  They're all horrendous, especially because it's not even coming from your own body.  Right.  All right, I mean, eating your own snot, all right, whatever, but someone else's snot, yeah, puts it on a whole new level.  We understand all that.  I feel like Brewer. 
[02:30:00]  But I think if you had a gun to your head and they gave you the choice, you would have a little buffet of snot, man, gunk.  You would go for the snot first.  Okay, all right, good way to present this.  There's little dishes, and each one has these four items in it.  They're not yours.  They're other people's items.  I smell Opie and Anthony contest.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  No, let me think.  I smell Opie and Anthony. 
[02:30:30]  Snot.  You know something?  Wheel of buffet.  Dude, dude.  Four Chinese food dishes.  One of them has snot in it.  Three guys.  Oh, my God.  Three guys will have clean Chinese food.  Dude, I might have to go with the urine before the snot.  Well, you know, all right.  I think, I think. 
[02:31:00]  I've done my research on the urine.  Is it a chick?  The chick urine?  Yeah.  Because that would make a big difference.  All things like.  Since it.  Oh, it's like a dog on a hot day.  It all depends.  It all depends if you like broccoli.  Look.  I might have to put snot at three.  Wow.  Yeah, I might have to put snot at three.  What's one?  One.  Easiest to go. 
[02:31:30]  Half.  Just, you know, so I know what you're saying now, too, because that's bad.  But how, then, can you put crap at number two?  It's that, yeah.  Yeah.  There's a big tie right there, but to divvy it up.  Let me tell you, if you don't care what people say about you, then you'd have to put crap immediately to the top.  If you're a little paranoid, your friend's going to call you a fan.  Right, right, right.  Then you're going to have to go and put the, for lack of a better word, spunk at the top. 
[02:32:00]  Jesus, man.  That's, let me tell you.  This is the hardest question I've ever been, let me tell you.  Yes.  Urine.  Piece of cake.  There's a lot of people.  Hey, if it's cake or urine, I'll be, you know, I don't compare it with cake.  Okay?  Because that's a no-brainer.  Urine.  The piece of cake is a piece of cake.  Urine's urine.  I did some, I was reading a book where they were talking about urine.  You did, didn't you?  Talking about urine.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  I think it was, what was that author?  Everyone bought the book about ten years ago.  Robert Fulgham?  Oh, the guy that had this whole plan about drinking your own.  Remember?  To health.  In one of his books, he talks about urine, and like in other cultures, they drink it like it's beer.  Right, because there's so many nutrients, supposedly, in the urine.  And they wash their hair with it, and if you have skin problems, it helps with the zits, and you can drink it for nutrition.  Right.  Remember that whole list?  I'll find it, I'll bring it in. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Some people brush their teeth with it, and they swear it's not that bad.  Yeah.  People are yelling, stop, stop, stop.  Oh, wow.  Oh, okay, so.  And they're called French.  Yes, correct.  Now, some people do, on a regular basis, eat the man gunk.  I don't think you eat, on a regular basis, the, well, yes, like on Rick, Ben, that's right. 
[02:33:30]  But I don't think, on a regular basis, many people eat crap.  But, can I just take the bullet in the head?  Go ahead.  All right, we take the bullet in the head.  Oh, new wheel of crap.  Was that right?  Over the top, Rick?  Rip that one up.  Someone finds that, you're screwed.  I don't even have to read it. 
[02:34:00]  Go ahead.  All right.  So, what's your top, like, what's the order?  It's got to be, God, I can't, I can't get the one and two.  Because, there's, the worst.  I got it.  What?  What?  I think I've solved the riddle.  Okay.  But, I need to explain. 
[02:34:30]  If you have to explain, you didn't solve anything.  Yes, I did.  All right.  I, if you allow me an explanation, I will.  I think I can get myself out of this.  I will be very quiet and let you explain.  Okay.  But, I have a feeling you're going for.  Okay, here it goes.  Out of the four.  The four.  Number one being the absolute worst, what would you put at number one?  And, let me explain.  All right.  I would put crap at number one.  That means male, er, would have to be second. 
[02:35:00]  Second.  Okay.  Right.  Because, crap can have some two in it.  Oh, is that, that is a lame one.  That's good, right?  That saves me.  No.  That doesn't wash.  Sure.  Right?  Stink?  I don't know why this is making a huge difference. 
[02:35:30]  But, whether the, whatever we're talking about, it comes out of a guy or a girl, is important.  A guy's number two, a guy's feces, is worse than a girl's.  Right.  And, and then you would have to put the man gunk at number one, female feces number two.  In the other direction. 
[02:36:00]  We didn't say male or female.  I know, now I'm kind of, I'm kind of, I'm kind of, it's all, look at Rick, he just looks  at me and goes, are you crazy?  It all, it all, it all, and don't jump out of this line, it all comes from the guy.  Now, what do you do?  Wow.  Wow.  You're, you're weaseling your way out.  Female categories.  It's the four body functions.  What is the worst?  Ah. 
[02:36:30]  Mm.  Mm.  Ah, so tough.  Running out of time, you want to phone a friend?  Uh, I'll tell the audience.  I'll tell you, I'll take the crap.  Give me the crap, Gilman.  This is the hardest question ever posed to man.  It's all man. 
[02:37:00]  Hell, they'll all make you sick.  But what will make you sicker?  Physically.  Not mentally.  Physically, crap will make you sicker.  Okay, here it is.  Here it is.  You have to go.  Kelly Ripper.  Come here, Kelly.  You crap right here.  And Gilman, get me a pudding spoon.  Okay, here's my order. 
[02:37:30]  Number one, crap.  Two, man gunk.  Three, urine.  Four, snot.  All right, I said it.  And as long as you're not crossing any fingers or anything, I will agree with your order.  Okay.  Your order.  Thank you.  You would?  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark wants to add one.  Yes, Mark.  He forgot colostomy bag juice.  No, that's like number two. 
[02:38:00]  No, with a little one mixed in.  A little bile.  No, it's like everything combined.  It's me.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  You're welcome.  This is the most disgusting conversation I've ever been part of.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Come here, you.  Come here.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Basically, what we're saying is just because they found the homeless guy, this stuff is happening all the time.  Please, please, God, don't be a reefer, Joey Pinalos. 
[02:38:30]  Please, please, don't be a reefer.  Listen, this commercial thing.  Please, please.  It always happens in this way.  Oh, thank God.  Gelman, toss one over here.  Toss a batch here.  I'm starving, Gelman.  All right, Anthony.  We got...  Kelly's anorexic.  You can barely get a nugget out of her.  Oh.  Pop out a raisin.  There's a raisin.  She cramps like a rabbit.  Come on, Gelman.  Pick me a winner. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  Well, blow a snap rocket, for God's sake.  I'm like Marty from Brooklyn's telling us to go back on vacation, you sick ass.  Sorry.  All right, Anthony.  I'm going to throw up.  Yes, yes.  We got some tickets to give away.  How many can we give away here?  Two pairs.  We got two pairs of tickets.  This is going to be a cool show.  Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry, April 16th at the Vanderbilt in Long Island. 
[02:39:30]  I think a bunch of us are going to the show to check it out.  Winners will also be in the O&A Skybox and go to a meet and greet with the bands.  Tickets on sale now.  They're playing the Vanderbilts on Long Island on April 16th.  Okay?  Yes.  Two random callers get the tickets.  212-757-1027.  If you want to see Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry, April 16th at the Vanderbilt in Long Island.  You guys have redefined debauchery.  Your gay oral station. 
[02:40:00]  1027.  All gay answers.  WNAW.  Look at John the Dump Guy poking his head in.  Yeah.  Isn't that fun?  Nostalgic, isn't it?  Don and Mike suck.  You see how fast he ran down the hall?  He ran off like a shot.  Anyway, Anthony, Planet Java.  Oh, yeah.  Finally, iced coffee just got cool.  We've been drinking this stuff for a few weeks now, huh? 
[02:40:30]  Loving the Planet Java.  Loving all three flavors, matter of fact.  That's right.  And those are a Javadelic.  It's like a grown-up milkshake.  Perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Karamoca.  It's chocolate caramel in a coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  What the hell is it?  It's a great mixer.  It's perfect, Anthony.  That's right.  And, of course, tremble.  Needs an extra kick in your day.  How about 121 milligrams of caffeine?  I don't know how to do it. 
[02:41:00]  Bam.  I don't know what 121 milligrams of caffeine means.  It's a lot.  It's a lot?  It's an F-load.  They wrote, bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Put it this way.  It's like you just snorted the Hells Angels' entire supply of crystal meth when you drink one bottle of tremble.  It's amazing.  The highest caffeinated drink in the country.  So, if you're a student or a trucker or a mom or anyone who needs a major boost, you're going to love this one.  Tremble does the trick deliciously. 
[02:41:30]  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  And available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  Iced coffee just got cool.  And it's called Planet Java.  Yeah, and they got the Planet Java trucks roaming around the tri-state area.  Check it out.  I mean, the packaging is really cool.  It's really cool.  It's very edgy stuff.  And good tasting to it.  Yes.  Planet Java.  This segment of Opie and Anthony is brought to you by Nokia AT&T Road Check.  Keep both of your hands on the wheel.  Get hands-free service at Nokia.com. 
[02:42:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Yeah, it's the O&A show.  Back from vacation.  Monday, April 9th, 2001.  Hey, having a lot of fun.  It's good to be back in the studio.  Are we allowed to say the other show? 
[02:42:30]  Which one?  The other show?  The other show.  The other show that's on after ours?  No.  No.  I don't know what we can say or can't say.  Well, we've got to straighten this out because I guess the other show that's on after us.  If someone aren't in for feedback, please let us know that some of this is getting through. 
[02:43:00]  It's just a point I want to make.  The other show that's right about when we don't re-sign with WNEW.  Yeah.  That they'll have our show.  Great.  You can have it.  Have fun.  Mm-hmm.  So they, you know, retaliated and talked about us for a little while, okay?  Yeah.  I have no problem with that.  I love when people talk about our show.  We can handle it.  We can fight back. 
[02:43:30]  We can have fun with it.  Yeah.  Maybe spin it, turn it into some good radio and stuff, okay?  As long as we can.  Now, I'm going to defend the other show.  They just did their little rant about us, okay?  Doesn't mean I like the other show.  But they have a right to talk about us whenever they feel like it.  Yeah.  It'll get cut out.  It's been told, Jeremy told Ed to cut the whole segment out.  Let them talk about it.  We don't care. 
[02:44:00]  It's management that's all uptight about the shows.  Right.  And the listeners aren't stupid.  They understand most of the shows associated with this radio station don't get along.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Because we're not telling listeners to, uh...  What?  I want to say what I want to say!  Twice.  Already twice.  You can't.  I told you.  Stop!  Let me say what I want to say! 
[02:44:30]  The music in the background is so slow from the delay built up, I feel like I'm stoned.  Just let me say what I want to say!  Just got dumped.  What got dumped?  Because now I've got to fill in the spaces.  Someone on Instant Feedback's got to help me.  Ooh, yay, onthway, ear, yay.  I'm not trashing another show.  I'm trying to make a point.  Keep your points to yourself. 
[02:45:00]  It's a good thing you guys have that music fed behind you.  We can tell when they don't by the skips in the music.  Ah, let me just make my point!  Ah!  What was said?  Because I just want to...  There's Jeremy.  I just want to make a point!  No!  And he's freaking out down the hall!  What's going on, Ben?  Uh, nothing.  At the moment. 
[02:45:30]  I just want to make a point!  We don't care if other shows talk about us!  Ah, that's good.  We don't!  What, Rick?  Don't get fired.  I won't.  You were just given the green light.  I just want to make my point!  All right, go ahead.  I'm not trashing the shows.  It's something that bothers me about, uh...  I'll say radio in general.  All right?  I'm not even going to try to pick on a show or a company, okay?  We trashed...  We trashed another show. 
[02:46:00]  We'll play by their rules.  Okay.  All right.  And everyone got nervous around here, okay?  Right?  Right.  All right.  That other show, because they have a show that's on now, heard about us, trashing them,  and they trashed us.  Uh-huh.  We are fine with that.  Yeah.  We don't care.  Always have been.  Always have been.  We were always able to defend our battles.  Whether it's a show within the company or another show that, uh...  You know, in the city that works for another company. 
[02:46:30]  We don't mind.  Bring it on.  We like that.  It makes our show fun.  Right.  Because we can fight back, okay?  We love it, because we're ruthless.  So, so we, we trashed this show, and they have the right to trash us back, because they're  on now, okay?  And they did that, okay?  But they're in a tape delay.  Right.  And we were informed that their trashing of us will not be on their show tonight when  it broadcasts live from New York City.  I said, let it go on the air. 
[02:47:00]  What are you panicking about?  Look, we're not going to walk off and cry and quit and stuff.  They're a little upset, Opie.  They like having the illusion that everyone's getting along around here.  That's all.  The fact is, I mean, management could, management could make believe all they want that all the  shows get along here.  The fact is, most of the shows do not get along.  That's okay, though.  Because no one's asking the listeners to pick. 
[02:47:30]  We're not asking you guys to just listen to us and don't listen to anything else.  We don't care.  If you listen to us and another show that we've expressed hatred for, whatever, great.  But don't start censoring when someone talks bad about us or when we talk bad about someone  else.  Just let it all ride.  Makes for some interesting radio.  Sure.  Well, they don't like it that way. 
[02:48:00]  Man.  Did most of that get through, hopefully?  Did that get through, Rick?  That's all I'm saying.  I don't want management protecting us.  Let all the shows talk bad about us.  We don't care.  Right.  That never came from us.  We don't care.  Talk as bad as you want about us.  What? 
[02:48:30]  That's not true.  Let me see that.  We shouldn't be having a party at all.  Oh, stop.  Who told you this?  Good source.  Good source.  Matt, what's going on?  I don't know if I could get away with saying this, but I mean, I don't know why they would  cut all that out.  That's probably the only reason I'd listen to that show.  See?  Yeah.  Now, thanks, Matt.  Now they're helping.  Hey.  Who's brave enough to walk down the hall and talk to Jeremy now? 
[02:49:00]  Just relay a message for Matt and I.  That we encourage and want the trashing of us on in New York.  Don't cut it out.  We can take it.  Yeah, we don't care.  We don't care.  We don't want people protecting us.  We'll fight our own battles.  We always did.  And always did a pretty good job at it, too.  I think so.  Let them trash us as much as they want. 
[02:49:30]  But let's not pretend anymore that everyone gets along.  It's not true, and it doesn't matter.  It doesn't affect listening habits.  Now, there are very few shows that get along around here.  That's for sure.  I like Ron and Fett.  They're good.  I like those guys.  We admitted that.  Right.  We said who we like and who we don't like.  But that's not saying that you shouldn't give them a try and make your own opinion. 
[02:50:00]  I like the sports guys.  Sports guys?  Personally, I swear to you, I've never heard the show.  I don't get up.  I'm really not up until 10.  I check out the sports guys.  Especially when other shows are running 20-minute commercial blocks.  See?  So I don't...  Now, that's funny.  I haven't listened.  And Rick, did he get an answer?  Or did he...  He said he would take it under advisement.  Come on.  Just let it go. 
[02:50:30]  We'll promote the show.  Tell them we'll promote the show.  There you go.  I'd like to hear what they're going to say.  I'll tell you what they said, but then they'll dump out again.  Yeah.  They really want our show.  We know that.  That's obvious.  Yes.  All right.  Dan from Jersey.  Thank you for not dumping out of that little discussion. 
[02:51:00]  We don't mind when people talk about us.  We're quite flattered by it.  We don't run to the boss and quit and cry.  If it gets us like where we're feeling pissed off about it, we fire back, and it's usually  much more ugly than what we got.  I'll tell you when we cry to the bosses, and this is what you can call us crybabies for,  when we have our hands tied behind our back and we can't fight back, and we're not allowed  to fight back.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  That's one, yeah, we do a lot of crying.  You should hear those meetings.  Just let us fight.  Let us fight back.  Every man for themselves.  That's how radio used to be.  Because it's really, it's fun, and it's so nasty when we actually can fight.  Let's go.  Let's all go under the water 60 feet and duke it out.  Duke it out in slow motion with a Frenchie.  Right.  Yes, Rick?  Um, he said, okay.  Good.  There you go.  They'll leave the segment in, and you can promote their show. 
[02:52:00]  Look at that.  Now we're all cooperating.  See?  I don't know why we'd take that segment out anyway.  Don't protect us.  If you have to protect other shows and that, whatever.  But don't protect us.  We don't need protection.  Right.  We do okay by ourselves.  Ow.  You need protection from yourself.  Yeah, we're a bit clumsy, but we can protect ourselves.  Dan from Jersey.  Anthony, conspiracy theory. 
[02:52:30]  Rival delis are hiring homeless people to spray the stuff on their competitor's salad bars.  Believe it.  It's true.  Wow.  You know something?  That makes perfect sense.  You got the salad bar across the street.  You get the homeless guy.  You pay him to do it.  Makes the news.  All of a sudden, you're living large.  No one's eating at those places that made the news for a while, right?  Who's eating there today?  Who's eating there today?  We ought to call them up and ask them if you had any customers today.  See, we missed an opportunity. 
[02:53:00]  We should have been outside that place with a cell phone today and asked if they ate the food there today.  Asking if anyone is coming out and going, you're eating here.  Why?  Drop the ball.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I have the perfect solution to this.  Yeah.  Call up the other show.  Tell them, listen, we would prefer, you know, we're letting everything that you say about us on air.  So, why don't you let everything that we have on air as well?  No, because we can't have it take up our whole show. 
[02:53:30]  But from time to time, we need to strike.  We need to talk about stuff.  And that's all we're looking for.  Well, no, if they say no, then say, all right, you guys are a bunch of pussies and move on.  No, we're going to get our way this time because, you know, this is how it has to be.  Well, we only have two months more of you guys.  So, you know, I want to make it as sweet as possible.  And controversy frees ratings, no?  No.  No.  No.  We've been known to destroy shows.  It's a cycle factor in your head.  All right, Eric. 
[02:54:00]  Oui, oui.  Oui, oui.  Now I know Jeremy's listening down the hall.  Jeremy.  There's 12 phone calls coming in that want to discuss this.  Yeah.  I will not do it.  No.  No.  See?  You allowed us to say what we had to say, and that's that.  So if you're calling with that, sorry.  Hang up immediately.  No, Dan, you're wrong.  We can still say love lines, you ass. 
[02:54:30]  By the way, the same program's running over and over again.  Has it?  Love lines?  Yeah.  God damn this thing.  Maybe it was just a two-day hour, though.  No?  It's just they run the same one.  That's beautiful.  Well, I know...  I thought this girl had crabs last week.  Did she get crabs this week?  No, I know the same show ran two days in a row.  Mm-hmm.  If we're sticking with the facts. 
[02:55:00]  It's the one with Bill Maher?  There you go.  Can we say Bill Maher?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Dr. Drew's a pussy.  That's good.  That's really good.  Come on.  Why not?  Dan from Hoboken again, helping us out today.  Am I the only one who isn't excited about a movie that is advertised as being from the producing team that brought you Deuce Bigelow? 
[02:55:30]  Was Joe Dirt written by the guys who wrote Is Pat?  Yeah.  You know, they're actually promoing that movie, Joe Dirt, by saying that it's the same producers as Deuce Bigelow.  Huh.  Who would say that?  I thought Rick liked that movie.  No, I hated that movie.  Even Rick hated that movie.  Wow.  That really had a suck.  See, last time we said that Deuce Bigelow sucked in, and we didn't laugh once through the whole thing, a bunch of people did call and try to tell us it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. 
[02:56:00]  I mean, I didn't get that movie, and I think most people didn't get that movie, and to advertise a new one by saying it's from the producers that brought you Deuce Bigelow.  It looks really bad.  David Spade, much funnier than Rob Schneider.  Oh, yeah.  Just shoot me.  Hilarious.  But this is kind of, the promos for it, every scene, like, you usually want to see some funny stuff in a comedy in the promos.  There's nothing funny going on. 
[02:56:30]  What's the concept of it?  I don't even know what it's about.  Don't you get a kind of a gist of what the movie's about?  You know, I was reading a little bit about Joe Dirt today.  Yeah.  This is what turned me off.  You know why he has the mullet?  Why does he have the mullet?  Are you going to read it?  No.  Is this a surprise ending because it's dead during the whole movie?  The reason he has the mullet in the movie, and I guess the mullet is a big part of this movie because a lot of people make fun of the mullet and stuff like that, okay?  I guess he was born without the top of his skull. 
[02:57:00]  Is that right?  Am I accurate?  Wait, wait.  So the mullet is helping...  To hide it.  Oh, wait.  No.  The parents put the mullet on the head to cover the exposed part that didn't...  And it all grew together, so now he can't get the mullet fake wig off his head.  Right.  That's when I said, okay, I think I'll go see Blow this weekend.  All right.  Wait a minute.  So the mullet is a wig.  Right.  That he can't get off his head because it's grown, the skin grew... 
[02:57:30]  The skin grew, skin, skull, whatever.  It all grew to the point where now the mullet is stuck on his head.  Right.  So why don't they just cut the mullet into like a regular haircut?  Right.  Or shave it off and give him a new wig?  Right.  Or anything?  Right.  Right.  That's kind of silly.  That's when I said, okay, I'm going to take the old pass on this one.  It ain't no Tommy boy. 
[02:58:00]  Why did he die?  I was doing so well.  Oh, boy.  I need a funny fat guy.  Oh, I forgot to play...  He should do his own spade report and talk about this.  I forgot to play one commercial here.  Oh, you bet?  I've got to sneak it in really fast, yeah.  Let's hear it.  Hi.  Ready to rock?  The Wiz.  Hey, f***ing f***ing f***ing.  The Wiz is bringing you a major league reason to celebrate opening day at the grand opening  sale of their f***ing f***ing. 
[02:58:30]  See?  You see this?  Milltown, New Jersey at Riders Crossing Shopping Center.  At every...  F***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing.  No, that's okay.  Hey, did you bring this dress?  I thought I came back to you.  F***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing.  At every store of The Wiz.  Oh, and every store.  All right.  Let's do this.  At the Riders Crossing Shopping Center.  At every store.  And...  What...  What am I doing?  What's that beat?  And The Wiz brings the f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing.  Just scrap that and I will do it all again. 
[02:59:00]  What a dick.  What did we learn next?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs.  One Opie seven WNW.  Anthony Powertel and Abacor.  Yes.  People losing their hair.  You're losing that hair?  Does it work if you're so, like, freaked out that the place you work sucks that you're ripping it out of your skull?  Will it grow back under those circumstances? 
[02:59:30]  Has your hair been looking thinner?  Well, Dr. Gordon, medical director of the Hair and Skin Treatment Center in New York, has some exciting news.  What makes people lose their hair is beep, beep, beep.  Okay, let me do it again.  I'm kidding.  What makes people lose their hair is a bad body chemical called dihydrotestosterone.  DHT at the Hair and Skin Treatment Center.  They've developed Abacor.  It's an all-natural treatment that stops DHT from attacking your hair follicle.  Yes.  You start regrowing new hair in the balding areas, guaranteed, in five years of chemical testing. 
[03:00:00]  Abacor shows a 90% success rate in both men and women.  Abacor is all-natural, completely safe and effective.  Call them up.  1-800-259-4178.  1-800-259-4178.  Use Abacor risk-free for a full three months.  1-800-259-4178.  Dr. Gordon's confident it'll work for you, too.  Talk, talk, talk, talking out of one's butt crack. 
[03:00:30]  Anthony.  It's a sign of personal confidence.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7.  Truly caseless, not funny.  W-A-W.  All right, it's time for what did we learn on the O.N.A. show today?  Very educational. 
[03:01:00]  A lot of fun today.  I wouldn't even know where to start.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7, right?  Right.  Let's start with Krikar.  Who?  What?  Krikar from Manhattan?  Here's a new one from a newbie to the instant feedback.  All right.  Today, I learned that had O.P. ripped open that French guy's oxygen tube underwater, Club Med would have escorted O.P. out with his hands up, baby.  Hands up.  Hands up, baby.  A song you hear every three hours at Club Med. 
[03:01:30]  Very good.  Did you hear that?  When you were at Club Med?  Oh.  I love the hands up.  Pete, what's going on?  What's going on, bud?  Tomorrow, I want to tell the story.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Tomorrow, I want to tell the story on the show of the guy that was entertaining the troops at Happy Hour at that bar Sharky's down there in Turks and Cacoys.  Sure.  And how he made love to all the women, as he sang.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  I'll get into it tomorrow.  Pretty good stuff.  Pete, what's up?  What's up, man? 
[03:02:00]  Hey.  I learned that when O.P. goes on vacation, he lets guys get on top of him and nail him.  What?  You learned?  I also learned that Anthony's in the .1% of the snot-picking census.  Very good.  Over and out.  He redeemed himself there.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, welcome back, douche-nozzles.  How are you doing?  Good.  Hey, great road show the other week, by the way.  I just thought, and I learned to make O.P. a badass.  Just add some water.  There you go. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, help me.  What kind of wussy do you turn into when you're skydiving?  Scott, I'm trying to wrestle the shoot off the guy's back as he's punching him.  Hey, leave my belly, shoot alone.  Leave my shooter alone.  Take care, man.  All right.  The answer, not brave enough to skydive.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned the Pope eats his own snot.  That's right.  Very good.  The Pope eats his own snot.  Yes.  But Ant doesn't.  He's good.  That's right.  Let's go to Uncle John.  He's always good for one. 
[03:03:00]  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that when you yell at Jeremy, he hides in the corner and sucks his thumb.  I also learned that Underwater Warrior is going to be taken on the message board.  Very good.  Take care, guys.  You know, we got to tell the other side of that.  We put Jeremy in a horrible position when we start talking like that.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  There's nothing he could say that will make sense.  But he would just love to, at that point, take the show off the air.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:03:30]  So he doesn't have to deal with it.  Krista, what's going on?  Nothing much.  I learned that Anthony...  Yeah.  What?  Oh, my God.  No, I learned that Dr. Drew is a pussy, and I just messed it up.  That's all right.  Yeah.  You're a teenager, so we'll let you fly.  Thanks.  Yes.  Yes, teen.  How old are you?  I'm 16 years old.  16?  Yes.  Yes.  One of the best teen ages to be.  Believe you me, I get that a lot from a guy that I really like. 
[03:04:00]  Unfortunately, he's 25.  Yeah, a little young.  She's a little young for our teen program.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Believe me, in two years, if you're still in New York, I'll come up there and wow you guys.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Krista.  You're welcome.  Right.  Wait, can I just...  What?  What?  What did you...  I didn't mean to do it that time.  I go...  Wait, can I get...  I'll only have to wonder what she was going to say.  Eddie, what's up?  Can I get Nate to do horrible things to myself in the studio? 
[03:04:30]  And you guys watch?  Yeah, I know.  Eddie, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, though, Nate?  I learned today it's cool to pick your nose and eat it until the third grade.  Yes.  Cake.  Very good.  Take care.  Take care.  No, it's not cake.  Andre.  Andre.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Welcome back.  Thanks.  Yeah, I learned that Opie and Anthony is syndicated in two countries because they're on in Queens.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Two countries, four states.  Later, F-Dodds.  All right.  Bye. 
[03:05:00]  Bleacher Anthony, today I learned that when there's controversy, Stinky stays in the studio.  That is so true.  When it gets a little uncomfortable, Stinky comes in the studio, feels safer in here.  Fecal matter rates above man-made mayonnaise.  That's what Dave learned.  Ernie O.  From Jersey.  Today I learned that Jacques Cousteau could have starred in The Matrix.  Ernie O.  Also wrote, the new Johnny Depp movie is about WNW from 7 to midnight. 
[03:05:30]  Starbursts are fruity.  That last one was.  Today I learned that you guys could play We're Back From Vacation promos until April 25th.  Here's a fruity Starburst.  This is a fruity Starburst.  Listen to Ron and Fez just before Opie and Anthony.  Goddamn, Fez. 
[03:06:00]  Very good.  Corpse Grinder Joke.  Today I learned that The Rack is Back.  Andre from River Edge.  I'd rather eat food from the deli on 39th than see Joe Dirt.  Today I learned that O and A are in two countries.  Oh, okay.  The U.S. and Queens.  Let's go to Stacey.  Stacey, what's going on?  Hi.  I just want to tell you guys are really great.  Don't take anybody's crap, guys.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Thank you.  No, you guys make my day especially go great at work. 
[03:06:30]  Thank you.  The word tool is just very useful because I've had stressful days and you guys are just great.  Well, thanks.  Tool.  Tool.  No, my last name is a tool name.  It's called Hammer.  So.  So we're what?  Hammer.  So we're.  You guys are not tools.  You guys are just great.  Don't take anybody's crap.  Especially you, Anthony.  Okay, Opie.  They're out of the darkness, Hammer.  Hey.  I have a hard time hanging up when they say nice stuff like this.  Yeah.  No, no.  Don't listen to that, please.  It's so weird how that works, isn't it? 
[03:07:00]  What?  It really is.  So we're what, Stacey?  We're good?  You guys are more than great.  I can't.  All right.  I can't.  Will, what's going on?  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  I learned that the NEW family has a sister that's a suck slut.  Yeah.  I also learned that we're all the same whether we eat cannoli or flan.  Uh-huh.  And, of course, I learned that Opie is a member, if not the founding member, of the Underwater 
[03:07:30]  Fight Club.  Yeah.  That was a good story.  I like that one.  Thank you, Will.  Hasta la vista, boys.  All right.  Let's go to Michael, who's next on NEW.  Michael, what's up?  Oh, what a day.  Hey.  Today I learned first day of spicknick season.  What's today, right?  Today was the first day of spicknick season.  Yes.  Later, boys.  All right.  Let's go to Mo.  Mo, what's up?  I want to play what I learned.  All right.  I learned that Anthony will kill senior citizens to save his own life.  Yes.  Who wouldn't on a sinking ship? 
[03:08:00]  You rat bastard.  All right.  Thank you.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned if Jeremy doesn't lighten up, Opie's going to take it to dry land.  That's really funny, man.  He's going to take it to dry land.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I learned that most of the girls who call this show have trouble speaking on the telephone.  I learned the first rule of Underwater Fight Club is you don't speak about Underwater Fight Club.  And, hey, Ann, unleaded or leaded? 
[03:08:30]  Unleaded.  What else would it be?  I'll talk to you later, all right?  All right.  Is that advice to cycle or something?  I guess it was.  I wanted to see what he would have said if I would have said leaded.  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Let's go to Reuben.  Reuben, what's up?  Oh.  Reuben?  Reuben.  Hey.  Yeah.  I learned that French people suck.  Hey.  There you go.  Hey.  All right.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  I believe they'll take care of that one down the hall.  I hope they took care of that one down the hall.  That was wrong on so many levels.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Great to have you back.  Hey, thanks.  Um, I learned today that if you're not born in America, you're pretty much screwed.  Yeah.  Thanks to Carlos Mazzia.  All right, Chris.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hey.  Great to have you back.  Thank you.  I learned that today is January 4th, 2000. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Very nice.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Everyone relax.  It's Stinky.  It's January 4th, 2000.  ONA will be back live in five minutes.  We only hire the best.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  I forgot one thing before.  I forgot that Al Pacino got wowed today.  Yeah.  I sound just like him, right? 
[03:10:00]  You sure did.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Okay.  We have...  We're giving out blow packages?  Yeah.  Blow.  Blow.  Blow packages.  All right.  When it receives a blow prize pack.  What?  You giving out packages of blow?  I don't know if it's packages of blow or if it's the other...  You know, what is this?  Files.  All right.  Now, that's a movie I'd go see.  What movie? 
[03:10:30]  Blow.  Oh, we're talking about...  Oh.  Oh.  You were giving away packages of blow?  Did you see the synopsis here for Joe Derrick?  Like I said, from the producing team of the comedy smash, Deuce Bigelow, comes a hilarious  comedy that says, life is a garden.  Dig it.  He's the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time.  Joe Dirt, David Spade, is a janitor with a mullet hairdo.  Acidwashed jeans and a dream to find the parents that he lost at the Grand Canyon when he was 
[03:11:00]  a belligerent trailer park raised eight-year-old.  Now blasting Van Halen in his jacked-up economy car, the irrepressibly optimistic Joe hits  the road alone in search of his folks as his wandering, misguided search takes him from  one hilarious misadvention to another.  Hilarious, Opie.  Joe finds his way to Los Angeles where a shock jock, Dennis Miller, brings Joe on his radio 
[03:11:30]  show to insult him.  But as Joe's life story unfolds, jeers turn to jeers and an entire captivated city tunes  in to hear the adventures of Joe Dirt.  Look, I gotta get to a movie theater.  I can't even stay for the end of the show.  I gotta get me to a theater.  I gotta see Joe Dirt.  Holy Christ.  Does that sound like it sucks, ass? 
[03:12:00]  Man, you just don't appreciate a good comedy when you see it.  Let me go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike?  Oh, yeah, sorry, guys.  Hey, I learned that a movie stuck his helmet in meadow today.  Later.  All right, Mike.  I just want to clear up something that Brian wrote on the instant feedback from Lake Grove.  Brian, no, it wouldn't be three months.  It would be five months.  Just want to clear that up. 
[03:12:30]  That long?  Yes, that long, yeah.  You ever did so?  Oh, we have to give out the blow prize pack.  A Moulignan?  If you want a blow prize pack, Ant.  Yeah.  That includes run of engagement passes.  Oh, well, yeah.  Of course it would be run of engagement passes.  Right?  You get the passes after the run.  It's not like we're giving away a Poseidon Adventure prize pack. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, it's not fine where it's playing.  Right.  That is ridiculous.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Winner receives a blow prize pack that includes run of engagement passes.  The book Blow by Bruce Porter and a mirrored film poster, courtesy of New Line Cinema and St. Martin Press.  I thought we were giving out mirrors.  Now, that would be funny.  Yeah.  A blow prize package, you get the tickets and a mirror.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That's true.  Sure.  All right.  And then there's a lot of stuff that we just don't have time to read. 
[03:13:30]  So, we're going to give away ten of these.  So, what happened?  We had a dog.  Damn it.  I missed it.  What is Stinky saying in the background?  He said the F-word.  Loud.  What are you doing, Stinky?  Wow.  Well, it's funny why he said it.  Because I thought we were still in Best Of.  Because Earl writes like three pages of F-ing.  Of F-ing.  After you have to read it to the guy every time.  And it's like, oh, well, Earl's very busy. 
[03:14:00]  Well, let me, I'll read it for everyone.  So, then they heard it and they just have to win the tickets.  Winner's information.  If you or any member of your household has won anything from NEW in the last 30 days, you are not eligible.  Chuckle Paquette.  Winner receives a blow prize pack, which includes one of the passes are valid only at...  A big dick black.  Passes are only valid for the Murray Hill Theater.  Murray Hill.  Prizes must be picked up. 
[03:14:30]  There's too much information.  Too much, too much.  All right, we got ten pairs of tickets to see blow and we throw in some other stuff.  A book in a mirror or a mirrored poster or something.  Rock.  All right, we're out of here.  Opie.  And for me.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  Ponder it.  F-ing.  Ponder it.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
