<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a shockingly graphic segment detailing the injury of an on-air guest who was spanked, resulting in a wound treated with hot sauce and alcohol. The hosts and others present made numerous crude and sexually suggestive comments throughout this incident.  The show then abruptly transitioned to a discussion of the Occupy Cairo protests, focusing on a video depicting police using pepper spray on protesters.  They contrasted this with the violence at other Occupy protests, including the recent clearing of Zuccotti Park and the protesters' relocation. The hosts offered commentary on the protesters' behavior and media coverage.  This was followed by a discussion of the immense popularity of *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*, comparing its success to other video games, and including personal anecdotes from the hosts about their own gameplay. The first hour concluded with Jimmy detailing his frustrating experience with a noisy parade outside his Harrisburg hotel, comparing his annoyance to E-Rock’s enthusiasm for celebrity autographs.  They briefly touched upon football game results and Robin Gibb’s illness before moving on.

The second hour began with a debate on the merits of *Lord of the Rings* versus Pixar films, followed by an analysis of recent box office numbers, specifically the poor performance of *Jack and Jill*.  This led to a hypothetical, crudely humorous interview scenario with Adam Sandler portraying Jill.  A significant portion of this hour was devoted to a highly irreverent and sexually explicit discussion of the *Twilight* saga, filled with graphic descriptions of the characters and their relationships.  A listener then called to discuss the double standard surrounding age differences in relationships, transitioning the conversation to Dane Cook's new movie, Lee Corso's profanity on ESPN, Rex Ryan's fine, and a critique of the NFL's family-friendly image and the prevalence of prayer in the sport.  A discussion of the UFC fight between Dan Henderson and Shogun Rua, hailed as one of the best ever, led to a call from a sixth-grade teacher about cursing students, which sparked a broader discussion on censorship, hypocrisy, and the changing names of school subjects.  This evolved into a heated argument with a caller over comments about Asian women. The segment concluded with a technically challenged attempt by a caller to tell a joke about sliding down a slide.

The third hour focused on a self-snowing Christmas tree, described by the hosts and callers with terms like "cum," "dandruff," and "white trashy."  They debated its mechanism, messiness, and impracticality, with a caller providing purchase information.  The discussion ranged widely, touching on the hosts’ upcoming comedy gigs, their assessment of their listeners' intelligence (80% "stupid"), a racist joke about black people and Mondays, their daily routines, their mothers (in anticipation of a Thanksgiving show), the ending of *The Sopranos*, and the health of various public figures.  A "Primetime Sam Roberts and one question" bit, a mock interview with Taylor Swift, was also included.  Several callers contributed to the conversation, often engaging in humorous or controversial exchanges. The segment concluded with continued discussion of the self-snowing Christmas tree.

The fourth hour began with a discussion of *The Sopranos* finale, specifically a theory about Tony Soprano's death foreshadowed in season three.  This led to a call from Jordan, who had previously appeared at a live broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe and had a contentious interaction with Jimmy. Jordan recounted his karaoke performance at the Hard Rock and his song choice.  However, this segment was largely dominated by extensive technical difficulties during Jordan's attempted a capella rendition of Michael Bublé's "Feeling Good," with multiple phone line interruptions and attempts to reconnect.  The show's engineer, Mars, was repeatedly mentioned.  Jordan ultimately agreed to appear in the studio to perform the song at a later date.  The remainder of the segment covered a listener's email about race in news reports, discussion of racial slurs, news stories about a fake doctor injecting cement into a patient's buttocks, a man receiving 80 years for counterfeiting money, Occupy Wall Street protesters staying in expensive hotels, and Chris Matthews' criticism of President Obama.  The segment ended with further discussion of the technical difficulties and Jordan's upcoming appearance.

The show concluded with a discussion of Ted Kennedy's political career and his relationship with Jimmy Carter.  Lenny, a caller, added historical trivia about US presidents.  An excerpt from a Ted Kennedy speech was played.  The conversation shifted to political speculation about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, with caller Howard suggesting Clinton replacing Obama as the Democratic nominee.  A commercial break for Steven Singer's jewelry collection ("IHateStevenSinger.com") followed.  Jimmy promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.  The final moments included banter between the hosts, a discussion about a photo spread of Anthony's girlfriend in *The Pulse*, and an advertisement for an amateur dance contest at a Rockland County strip club.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Sirius XM, the beginning of today's Opie and Anthony Show is just moments away.  Until then, here's some of the worst of O&A to keep you busy.  By the way, could be the gayest moment in Opie and Anthony Show history.  Oh, you think?  You think?  The guy's fucking a cup while he gets spiked by an intern.  Yeah.  All right, let's listen.  Yeah.  Listen in.  Oh!  Oh!  Come on!  You can...  Hold it up!  Hold it on!  Keep it together!  Keep it together! 
[00:00:30]  No, no!  Keep it together!  Damn!  Come on!  Dignity!  Dignity, my man!  Get your stuff in your cup!  Wet that hand real good!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Time out.  I'm calling a time out.  Yeah.  Someone explain what the fuck is that.  What, the scream?  Yeah.  Is that real?  He has a pain problem, yeah.  He has a pain problem.  I don't like it.  Yeah, he's got to yell to get it out of his system.  All right.  I don't like it.  Wet it up real good.  Don't dry it.  And get a nice flat smack on that.  Game on.  Here we go.  All right.  Other cheek.  All right. 
[00:01:00]  What happened?  Mind the cup.  What happened?  You getting excited?  Why are you hitting the cup?  All right.  Hold on.  That would fucking hurt.  That's why I hit the cup.  This is real.  That shit.  All right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a half a retard.  He's ridiculous.  Oh, man.  Turn around.  Look what he did to his ass already.  Tell me this isn't real. 
[00:01:30]  Take a look.  Oh, he broke it open.  Holy shit.  Dude, your ass is bleeding.  Earl, you get closer.  Touch it.  Earl, look at his ass.  Look at his bloody ass, Earl.  Earl's ready to faint.  Wow.  You fucking.  It's bleeding.  Earl, rub his ass, will you?  You are good at that, Patrick.  What the fuck?  Not just my hands.  Wow.  Is this gay?  How many more do we get?  I say a couple in a row.  A couple?  You know.  All right.  Two smacks.  I think you smack him through the screening, he's screaming, he's going to do okay. 
[00:02:00]  Holy shit.  Can we pour some, like, alcohol on the wound?  Well, we had a problem with his ass.  Pouring through my ass.  Yeah, yeah.  Some hot sauce hit it from Jay Moore.  Oh, yeah.  I heard about that.  We had to go to the hospital.  We had to go to the hospital because he had hot sauce in his asshole.  How is Jay, by the way?  Tell him we said hi.  Yeah, he doesn't like getting up early.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  He doesn't like getting up early.  It seems to be it.  No, you've got to be careful because he's very sensitive.  My ass is still cut up from God's.  Just get the cheek wound. 
[00:02:30]  No asshole with the alcohol.  Hold on.  Here, hand this to Patrick Duffy.  That's good.  I won't look.  All right, don't look.  Just Patrick Duffy.  It's the rest of us that shouldn't be looking.  But he's just, yeah.  I don't mean a lot.  It still hurts.  Yeah.  The alcohol hurt, too.  Believe me.  All right.  There you go.  Don't get it too close to his mouth.  It automatically goes in any kind of alcohol, and he'll fucking drink it.  Do not hit his asshole, whatever you do.  Yeah.  Is he going to the bathroom?  Seriously. 
[00:03:00]  Is he going to the bathroom?  What is he doing?  Why are you making last face?  I know nothing good can come of this, Anthony.  Wait, what's going on over there?  There's a little alcohol.  I just feel like something bad's going to happen.  There's a little alcohol.  Something bad's going to happen.  We want to keep it clean.  We want to keep it clean.  All right, off you go.  All right, here we go.  Here you go.  Take it, brother, like a man.  Two in a row.  Go ahead.  That wasn't that bad.  What the fucking dude?  What? 
[00:03:30]  What happened, bro?  Fuck it, dude.  No!  You can't!  Oh, fuck!  What was it in his hand?  I see hot.  We got him with I see hot.  I see hot.  Oh, fucking paranoid now.  They're full of your pants.  Fucking.  We got him with I see hot.  What the?  What happened?  Oh, I fucking fell five fucking different slabs.  They're just going out of nowhere. 
[00:04:00]  Remember, it's I see hot.  Don't put water on it.  That's what fucked you up last time.  Water and I see hot.  Yeah, write it out, brother.  Water is the worst thing with I see hot.  Oh, it is.  Oh, no.  It's like an activator or something.  No, I just feel uncomfortable.  One more and then we're done, I guess.  One more snack.  Oh, turn around and take a look at it first.  You're going to be worried about this kid.  Look how bad his ass is.  I can't even turn to me.  It looks like a baboon.  You have fucking baboon ass.  Oh, boy. 
[00:04:30]  What's wrong?  Yeah, there's something fucking burning my ass.  What's wrong?  There's something burning my ass.  That was not fucking water.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you fucks.  What's wrong, brother?  Oh, we're good.  I'm taking off tonight.  So what up to it?  Yeah, all right.  Well, I'll take off.  His ass is fucking red.  What's wrong, bro?  I need water.  Where are you going?  My ass is burning.  No, you can't put water on it.  It's burning.  Squirt a little water from the bottle on it.  Remember, if you get water on it, it spreads.  It'll make him feel better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Just toss a little of the pollen spring on it.  It'll make it feel better.  It'll cool it down.  There you go.  There you go.  See?  It's burning, though.  No, it's not burning.  It's in your mind.  It's better?  No.  You feel it growing?  I ain't fanning the flames, really.  Earl, do me a favor.  Massage his ass and make it better.  Touch it.  Just touch it.  Rub it.  Just touch it.  Rub it, baby.  Come on, Dad.  Are you all right?  All right.  How you doing?  You starting to feel the burn?  Yeah.  Are we done?  I'm starting to feel the burn big time here. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  All right.  And I might throw up.  Well, I think one more slap.  Okay.  One more slap.  You don't want one more?  Yeah.  Try to get the other cheek.  Equal out the ass cheeks.  Yeah, get the other cheek.  The one ass cheek is just too red.  Yeah.  The right one.  Ow!  That was my fucking spine!  My spine!  Fucking paralyze me!  Fucking aim next time!  The fucking thing is right here!  Oh, boy.  All right, Jiminy. 
[00:06:00]  The show could get no gayer.  All right, all right.  His ass is so chewed up.  It's like, chop me.  This is Fez's prom picture right there.  Before the dance.  Oh, is that right?  He fucking chopped me.  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now.  Ah, good morning, everyone. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, hello.  We're discussing Occupy Cairo.  Occupy Cairo is rocking.  And the pepper spray in the kids' faces that were sitting there peacefully.  Whatever.  Anthony, you think they should have been sprayed, huh?  Well, you know what?  I love when they take clips totally out of context.  All you're seeing is a cop with a big pepper spray thing. 
[00:07:00]  Just pepper spraying the line of protesters that are sitting in the street, having a little sit-in.  I don't even...  Is it a street?  I'm sure they were told to disperse a sidewalk, whatever the fuck it is.  It's just a sidewalk in the middle of nowhere.  It looks like they're in the middle of a park.  The problem I have with it is because then they're just kind of picking them up and taking them off.  I have no problem with them dragging them by their feet to get rid of them.  But if they're going to pick them up and take them anyway, why spray them first?  Because they're a little more compliant once you spray them.  I think they're a little more compliant.  That guy emptied his can, though. 
[00:07:30]  It's no big deal.  He emptied his can.  No, there was a thing circulating that said, how much of this can did I use?  99%.  Oh, really?  And they have a picture of him just spraying them.  He really enjoyed pulling the trigger on that thing.  Yeah, whatever.  It's pepper spray.  I tell you, you could do a lot more harm just fucking grabbing one of these idiots by the arms and pulling them up.  Were they resisting, though?  If they were resisting, that's one thing.  Would you take pepper spray?  He goes, get up and move.  Would you take some pepper spray? 
[00:08:00]  Well, for a cause, if I was sitting there like that.  You have to.  That's part of the deal.  Look at Cairo.  They're fucking burning the people in their tents.  20 people dead over the weekend in Cairo.  And people bitch that this is a police state, man.  It's brutality.  A little pepper spray.  What is it?  It's nothing.  You get worse.  Put on your wings when you eat it.  That's a lot of spray coming out.  Yeah, that's a lot, man.  So what?  Maybe we should pepper spray ourselves, man.  For the show.  For the show. 
[00:08:30]  For the show.  Probably a lot of radio guys have done that one, huh?  Yeah.  Would you get pepper sprayed for the radio show?  Yeah, it might.  I would be curious about it.  I don't want to get it done, but it's like, cops have to go through it before they get it.  Your eyes run.  Your nose runs.  You're fucking, it's all stingy.  Stingy.  What led up to this?  They said move, but they didn't move.  But why didn't they just pick them up and drag them away like they normally do?  They do after they pepper spray them.  Why pepper spray them first?  You're not going to get a big fight out of them after they're pepper sprayed.  Yeah, look, they're all getting up now.  You know.  You can't sit there with pepper spray in your eyes. 
[00:09:00]  Right, so they're going to get up.  A few of them got out of the little line there before the cops even had to move in and grab them.  Wow, man.  They're just showing the video over and over and over again.  This is what the news is now.  This is what society is.  Everything's so fucking documented on people's dumb phones and cameras.  And then they can play it ad nauseum on the news.  It's ridiculous.  But you said Occupy Cairo. 
[00:09:30]  What's going on there?  It's a military state, basically?  Yeah, you know, they had that big thing where they didn't like Hosni Mubarak over there running the show.  They got him out.  So it was all wonderful.  Everybody here was watching and going, oh, it's great.  There's going to be democracy in Egypt.  It's going to be wonderful.  And, oh, what?  The military is in charge now.  So the military runs the gernt now.  So what do they do?  They occupy Cairo like we do occupy Wall Street? 
[00:10:00]  Yes, they're very angry, the people.  So, again, they came out like they did with Hosni and said, hey, we don't want the military in charge.  We want the civilians in charge, and we want this.  And the military rolled over them and killed 20 of them, I think, within the weekend.  That's a little worse than the pepper spray.  They had their tents set up, much like they did in Zuccotti Park.  And, well, they burnt the tents.  They just covered them with gasoline and burnt them. 
[00:10:30]  And they fired some rubber bullets at the crowd.  And then they do what they also do, which is take their armored personnel carriers at about 50 miles an hour and just drive through the crowd.  Wow.  Now that's a protest.  That's a little different than what's going on in America.  That's some commitment if you're going to show up for that protest.  And there goes the pepper spray again.  And they show the pepper spray like, oh, boy, is that Egypt?  Wow, that's crazy.  Where is that, Syria?  Oh, my God.  This is, oh, it's the United States. 
[00:11:00]  This guy's kind of enjoying it, eh?  Of course he is.  He's kind of enjoying it.  It's got to be a pisser to fucking pepper spray a bunch of shitheads in the face.  What happened to that guy?  He's on leave?  Administrative leave.  Until they can figure it out?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Well, someone gave the word.  Look, go.  Horrid hairdo woman.  Oh, I hate this woman.  The CNN woman?  Yeah.  That's sort of Asian with that weird, I can't even describe her hair.  I don't even know what that is.  Looks like something out of Thunderdome.  But who gave the word to pepper spray the students? 
[00:11:30]  They're still investigating that.  That's why.  All right.  You sit out.  You sit here, and we're going to see what happened here.  Do a little investigation.  We'll get you back on the force.  Yeah.  And then everyone gets fired.  Well, if there's one guy, it's like sometimes they're wrong.  I mean, if they're resisting him.  As far as I'm concerned, he can stick his gun in their mouth.  But if they're not resisting, and they're just going to pick him up anyway, you shouldn't  spray him first.  They're just sitting there peacefully.  What were they blocking it?  Do you know?  I don't know.  But you know what?  Let them just sit there, then, and just move about your life. 
[00:12:00]  Why let them?  If it's not bothering anyone.  It probably is.  I mean, if you're sitting down in the middle of Broadway or something, I get it.  But it didn't look like there was even a street there.  Eh, it probably bothered.  What do we know about this?  What were they disrupting?  I just saw the video clip like everyone else.  Didn't do anything.  Yeah, there might have been something leading up to that.  Yeah, I know.  I want to know.  That's why they don't show.  I want to know.  I went down to Zuccotti Park yesterday.  Hey, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  For officially the last time.  Really?  Oh, they're not coming back there.  I had to see it for myself.  They are not coming back to Zuccotti Park anytime soon.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, man.  They got the fences pretty much around.  The police, like, metal, whatever you fucking call them, barricades.  Yeah.  There's only two ways in.  Yep.  And two ways out.  Meaning just two ways.  Yeah.  Two in and outs, if that makes sense.  That's it.  And they got cops down there.  They got security guys down there. 
[00:13:00]  And they're power washing the shit out of the place.  And I went down there yesterday morning.  And there was six people inside the park.  Probably, like, real hardcore lunatics.  Well, homeless people, basically.  Yeah.  Borderline homeless slash, you know.  Of course.  We're fighting the man.  They're probably there.  Where the food at?  Right.  Where the food in the library?  I was here, and there was food in a library.  Yeah.  That's kind of sad, though.  Is it?  It kind of is.  In the era? 
[00:13:30]  Well, it was kind of fun down there, man.  Yeah.  I like to hear some cool music.  Where are they now?  Unlike yourself, I enjoyed a little drum circle every once in a while.  Oh, God.  The drum circle.  I kind of enjoyed that.  Who could enjoy a drum circle?  It's noise.  I kind of liked it.  And then, you don't like anything just with a rhythm.  Just fucking over and over again.  No, I like that.  I just don't like noise.  I went to dead shows.  Drums and space, I fucking hated.  But drum circle down in Zuccotti Park, I enjoyed. 
[00:14:00]  God damn.  And they're probably the same thing.  And it was really sad to see where the People's Library used to be.  Oh, it's just...  People's Library.  The People's Library.  It's just gone.  They power-washed away the Zuccotti lung.  Zuccotti lung.  That's what they're trying to do.  They probably power-washed all the fleas away.  Yeah, the fleas.  All the fucking disgusting...  You wouldn't even know that that place was kind of, dare I say, cool for the last two months to see.  The place is a fucking disaster. 
[00:14:30]  Good.  So, it's done.  But I guess because they can't hang out at Zuccotti Park anymore, they went to the mayor's place up on 79th Street.  Well, I saw that, and they can only do so much there.  They were playing their drums.  There's a great picture in the paper where there's a guy.  He's kind of a hippie-ish slash protester.  Yeah.  And he's got his drum, and he's in front of a police officer like, well, I think I'm going to just drum here because I'm not allowed to drum in the park anymore.  And the police officer is looking at him like, get the fuck out of here. 
[00:15:00]  What are you doing?  You can't just drum.  Yes.  Stop your drumming.  It's America.  Oh.  So, they hung out outside the mayor's abode yesterday.  Bloomberg lies to cover a banker's fraud.  Wow.  Man.  There's the guy.  Oh, he's wearing one of those dumb hats.  There's the guy.  Oh, what a dumb hippie chick dancing. 
[00:15:30]  Go away!  Is this outside the mayor's place?  Yeah.  Nice.  Do you think that they're fraudulent?  Huh?  Do you think they're just trying to be something they're not?  They are so hard.  You're a joke.  A cliche.  Are you going to dance?  Just jumping and clapping?  They're doing the Grateful Dead dance.  Not very good.  Who's playing the horn?  Ravi?  Where's Ravi?  What do you think?  A whistle. 
[00:16:00]  A horrible sax player.  She's pretty cute.  And all kinds of shitty fucking percussion.  Well, I know drum circles, and I'm going to give this one a C-.  Drum circles get a lot better than this.  A lot better.  F.  F.  You know what's sad?  I recognize a few of these people from my time at Zuccotti Park.  That's it.  Now, I heard that they were going to drum until the sun.  Yeah, 24 hours. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, really?  Or something.  Now, how is that allowed?  That's disturbing the fucking peace.  Well, you're allowed to protest.  Well, you're not allowed to disturb the peace.  But you're allowed to protest.  They're banging a fucking drum at all hours.  I'm sure they shut them down.  They better have.  Especially in that area where there's a lot of money.  Yeah.  If it was a poor area, then they might let them go for 24 hours.  We all know that shit goes on.  Where the mayor has his apartment.  Yeah.  Quote apartment.  He probably owns the whole block. 
[00:17:00]  There's some nice real estate up there.  There's no fucking reason to have shitheads clanging and banging away while you're trying to sleep.  What would you do if you had a drum circle outside your house?  Holy shit.  Outside the compound.  They would know that they were not welcome.  Not welcome.  How would you do that?  Because you abide by the law.  How would you do it, you think?  I'd call the police.  You would start with that?  Yes, I would call the Nassau County Police Department.  What if they came by and said, look, Mr. Cumia. 
[00:17:30]  No, they'd come pulling up.  No, I know what they're doing.  I'd be like, hey, Steve, Bill, why don't you take care of the laws on my side?  I'll play cards with the chief of police.  I understand all that, but for the show.  For the show.  Let's say they can't do anything and they have to leave and they say, look, they're allowed to protest.  Well, I'd probably go out and water my lawn.  I'd go out and water the lawn first with some freezing cold water with the big fucking nice fire hose nozzle I have on the end of the hose. 
[00:18:00]  Nice.  And then I'd water the lawn and hopefully I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't miss the lawn.  Right.  And hit the protesters with the hose.  Would you have your own hose out there or just your sprinklers?  Oh, I'd have a hose out there.  Yeah.  I'd turn on the sprinklers and the hose.  Hey, hey, hair lip guy.  Hair lip guy is on another video.  That's bullshit, man. 
[00:18:30]  That's my guy.  Hair lip, hair lip.  Imagine kissing him.  Ew.  That means kissing a guy, first of all, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, that is true.  Let's just take the guy equation.  Just say hair lip, hair lip.  Yeah, a girl lip.  Start with girl hair lip.  Imagine if you were a girl kissing that, like that was your date.  And then you're fucking, yeah, if you breathe out, it probably goes.  He probably smells like coffee.  He just looks like he has coffee breath.  Yeah, how do you clean the hair lip hole?  Yeah, it's all hard.  It's like an asshole with teeth behind it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Despise him.  Despised.  Am I right?  How was the rest of the weekend?  My weekend was pretty much spent playing Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3.  Really?  With the likes of Keith the Cop and Robert Kelly, the wonderful Robert Kelly, and a bunch of fans.  It was a big team event.  Let me jump in on this one because we were discussing it before the show.  Yeah.  Call of Duty, first week out, made $775. 
[00:19:30]  Well, I think that might have been a million.  Oh, millions.  Yeah.  I thought it was $775, which would be great for both of us.  $775 million?  Million dollars.  In one week.  I heard in the opening weekend it was over $400 million.  It's cranking.  It's the whole world, right?  Everyone in the world.  Yeah.  You know, it's interesting.  It's on the online portion of the game.  When you're in the lobby area waiting to join a game, they show a map of the world. 
[00:20:00]  Wow.  And then they have the day and night thing, and it moves as quickly as that.  And you see where everyone's playing in the world.  And, you know, the United States is completely green with little green speckles.  Yeah.  That represent, I don't know, not people, but a fuckload of people.  Right.  And then you see, like, Japan.  There's, like, a little bit in Japan.  There's some people.  And then Europe is huge, too.  And then Africa, there's, like, a speckle here and there. 
[00:20:30]  And, yeah, Australia, you see, like, in the major cities of Australia, you see some people there.  Can you play against some dirty Iranians?  Oh, you can play if they want to play.  I haven't.  Did you see that part of the map?  Anyone playing over there?  Yeah, yeah.  There's speckles, a little bit of speckles everywhere.  That's kind of cool.  But for the most part, it's the United States, Europe, Japan.  Canada?  Canada, yeah.  Obviously.  North America.  South America, you get some, too.  But, yeah, and you're playing people from all over the place.  We were playing. 
[00:21:00]  We had a great time, though, man.  That's awesome.  Bobby's hilarious.  And playing with some fans, too, that figured out my name.  One guy was hilarious.  He just starts going.  He's like, wait a minute.  Is this Anthony?  I was like, yeah, yeah.  He goes, holy shit, I still can't believe I'm playing with Anthony.  And I go to Keith and Bobby.  I go, hey, guys, isn't it just great to be playing with me?  I'm like, shut up, you asshole.  But, yeah, playing with the fans is fun. 
[00:21:30]  But the point I wanted to make, so $775 million for the first week for Call of Duty.  And then I asked you, what was the second most popular video game?  Because even though that's really impressive, it drops off quickly.  Yeah, Battlefield 3 probably right now.  It's pretty big.  What's the third hottest game right now?  And then that, what is that, yeah, Skyrim.  Skyrim?  Skyrim is, yeah, one of those massive multiplayer.  Could you fill out the top five?  For playing.  Top five biggest video games right at this moment? 
[00:22:00]  Nah, I could, top three, easily.  And then it gets a little shady?  And then it gets a little, I don't know.  But, yeah, Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, you know, without fucking doubt, is number one.  And are those other games, how many millions are they making?  I don't know.  I don't know money-wise, but they're huge.  It's so weird that everyone gets into one video game.  Yeah, when one really hits and can pull together everything that you want in a game.  And then the past ones have done well, too. 
[00:22:30]  The past Call of Duties have done well, so.  Yeah, I think I might call me, you know, call me a geek,  which I tend to be with these games, but that, maybe Star Wars, The Old Republic,  when it comes out, I might check that out for a multiplayer, you know,  massive online multiplayer game.  But other than that, I stick to, you know, I stick to pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I stick to first-person shooters.  Yeah.  Some shooters.  Jimmy, someone said you had a bad Sunday.  Is that somebody just being an idiot?  Did you have a bad day yesterday?  Did you tweet?  Oh, I just said, yeah, I hate everybody alive.  Yeah, that's what you wrote.  Why?  What happened?  I was just cranky and tired, and just being single is annoying me.  Oh, that part. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  But didn't you have some good shows in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania?  I did, actually.  Yeah, I really loved Harrisburg.  I heard you did.  I enjoyed Harrisburg very much.  Is there anything to do in Harrisburg?  Talk to Sam.  That's it, huh?  Jesus.  Oh, all wrestling talk.  Shut up.  Sam makes a wrestling.  Sam came because Kenny had a family function this week, which I knew.  And so I'm like, who do I bring with me to help me sell merch?  Because it has to be set up while I'm on stage, and I want it to be somebody I trust and account the room.  So Sam came with me.  Did you give him a quarter? 
[00:24:00]  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  And we had a nice ride in, and everything was fairly uneventful until we checked in and did the show.  And then after Sam sells merch, and some people wanted to take pictures with him, too.  Oh.  And he makes a wrestling face in his pictures.  Oh, no.  It was okay if you're taking one, but he does it in every picture.  He crinkles the nose up and goes, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  It's every picture he takes.  I've seen it. 
[00:24:30]  It's not a wrestling face.  Why do you do that, Sam?  I think it's funny.  It's evil, angry Sam.  It's just funny because he doesn't know what else to do because a part of him is still shocked that anybody would want his photo, as he should be.  Yes.  It's true.  I mean, I feel uncomfortable in most pictures anyway, so.  It's terrible.  If I have a weird face to make, it makes things easier.  Let me see the face again.  I haven't seen it in a while.  Oh, dude, it's awful.  Jesus.  I know.  She's got a fucking big spread in the New York Post this morning.  Wow. 
[00:25:00]  Melissa's got a Christmas fashion thing going on in the Post today.  Every page.  The whole section.  What is her name?  Miss Post or something?  She's mailing a letter to Santa in that one.  Oh, looking sassy.  Hilarious.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  The guy's way bigger than you, and you're making some face like you could take him.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, Sam.  I can do that in every picture?  Every single picture.  Isn't that also the caricature face that your t-shirt picture is making? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  The guy drew me making that face.  This is what Sam does.  I think Sam's a little OCD.  I think that's part of his food issue.  And I think that's part of his thing now is he takes pictures like that.  Oh, God.  It's horrible.  I almost banned him from the table.  Yeah.  One person wanted a picture with me and Jim together, so I stood next to Jim doing it  after he had already complained about it.  And the whole time they're taking the picture, Jim is just under his breath going, yuck.  Yuck.  I was so unhappy with that face. 
[00:26:00]  Look at what Sam looks like next to a real man.  It's terrible.  That guy was huge.  He's a big kid.  He's giant.  He's an art teacher, too.  Yeah.  I'm like, what do you play ball?  I'm an art teacher.  Oh, that's weird.  It's like when you ask a black guy who's really tall, like, you play ball?  No, I don't.  No.  I'm an attorney.  Stop.  I'm just kind of racist on me.  So assume.  Assume he's not a basketball player.  He's an attorney.  Nothing else about Harrisburg.  I mean, really?  What is it?  You guys...  There was a parade. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, fuck yeah, man.  Right outside.  What?  A hotel room.  A what?  A parade.  I was a...  A parade in Harrisburg.  A parade.  What do you mean a parade?  Like, a group of people gathered and marching bands and motorcycles and fire trucks and blowhorns.  For what reason?  I hadn't slept the night before.  Friday night, I just couldn't sleep going into Saturday morning.  I slept like two hours and I woke up.  And then I hear, uh...  Test.  One, two.  Test.  And I'm like, what the fuck is that? 
[00:27:00]  It's coming from outside.  What the fuck is that?  You never wanted to hear that.  And it was a hilt that had those itchy sheets.  Like, they use really industrial detergent or something.  I was like one of those...  The Marriott's are the best hotels in the country because I can sleep in them.  Couldn't sleep in this.  I just felt like my skin was electrified.  Whenever I get a weird reaction to something skin-wise, I can't sleep.  Well, the hotels have to burn all that cum off their sheets.  That's true.  They over-dry them.  Literally, I wonder if it is something like that, though.  Of course it is.  So I'm laying there and I'm like, oh, motherfucker. 
[00:27:30]  It's like nine in the morning.  So I call down.  I look out and I see them setting up chairs.  Twelve floors down in like a little town square.  You just know this isn't going to be one.  And I'm livid.  I call up and I'm like, uh...  Why?  I call the operator.  I'm like, why is this idiot talking into a microphone?  And she's like, well, there's a parade today.  And I'm like, I want to move.  Why didn't you tell me this when I checked in?  I was literally this angry with her.  And she goes, you don't want to see the parade?  I go, no, I don't. 
[00:28:00]  Is this the actual parade?  That's it.  Yeah, I was watching it.  No, it's like the Thanksgiving Day, the Macy's Day Parade or whatever.  And apparently...  With one float.  Everybody in Harrisburg goes to this thing.  Well, what else are they going to do?  Nothing.  See Jimmy and see the dumb parade.  That's all they had this weekend.  They moved me.  I was so angry.  Literally within five minutes, a bellhop was up there.  I put all my shit on a cart, and she moved me to the opposite side of the hotel, and  I slept till 5 p.m.  I was so...  What time was this at?  10 in the morning.  Oh, my God.  People are still sleeping. 
[00:28:30]  It's ridiculous.  Parades fucking stink.  I like a good parade every once in a while.  There's no such thing as a good parade.  I said every once in a while.  What's a good parade if everyone's getting blown on the float?  I hate...  Because they're all the same.  A shitty high school marching band.  There it is. 
[00:29:00]  It's nice.  Nobody enjoys that.  It's noise.  I hated parades even as a kid, because you never saw anything.  You can't get to the front.  You don't like when they march in unison?  Fucking no.  Yeah, parades are dumb.  And all the horn players go like this at the same time?  Oh, yeah.  The choreography as they're playing, it's pretty amazing.  Amazing.  He's fantasized about having a rifle.  When I heard that, I started to think about if I had a rifle and I could just start killing 
[00:29:30]  people down there, so I didn't have to hear that shit.  Did Sam, did you enjoy the parade?  No, it stirred me, I guess, at 10, and I was able to sleep through it.  Really?  But then it woke me up when it got serious at 12.30.  It woke me up, because that's when the motorcycles came.  Oh, no.  And so I just heard this annoying woman who Jim heard testing the blowhorn, talking on  it, and all these motorcycles revving.  Oh, wow.  That's noisy.  And then I was like, all right, maybe I'll just wait until after the motorcycles. 
[00:30:00]  But then after the motorcycles, the fire trucks came.  Oh, no.  And then after the fire trucks, the drum bands came.  And the thing was hours and hours and hours long.  I couldn't believe they didn't tell people.  They probably had one circle and just kept going around and around and around and around.  Why don't they tell people that, though?  You're checking into a hotel, like, let us know.  Well, they didn't want to see the parade.  Fuck the...  I couldn't believe she said that to me.  But most people, when they're in a hotel, are up by 10, probably, is what they're thinking.  Oh, they're wrong.  Probably thought you were there just to see the parade. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Maybe a lot of people checked in just to see the parade.  You're right.  You can get one of these high floors.  I can watch the parade for your own.  And you don't know why they were having a parade.  No.  Why would they?  It's Harrisburg.  It's probably their Thanksgiving parade.  They don't want to compete with Macy's, so they do it, you know, a little early.  What is that Macy's-type floaty thing?  That's what I'm saying.  Exactly.  It's a tiger.  It's an orange tiger.  Was that the only float they had?  No.  Hours later, they had one penguin.  It's very nondescript.  It's not a sponsor.  It's not Tony the Tiger. 
[00:31:00]  It's not, you know, anything you'd know.  It's just a balloon.  Just a big pussy tiger.  Yeah.  I miss living in these smaller places, these smaller towns.  Where they only have two floats.  It's a waste of time.  Or two balloons for everyone.  It's not enjoyable.  Everybody's just a bunch of drum bands.  Well, look at the people came out for it, so they're enjoying themselves.  Old men on motorcycles.  And a tiger and a penguin separated by hours of noise.  I love it.  Sounds great.  I wish I went. 
[00:31:30]  And I knew, I was so, I woke up and I was like, oh, because at first I woke up and I  was like, what is that?  Yeah.  And then right after that I go, oh no, Jim is going to be livid.  Because he was right next door to me.  And I looked at my phone and I already had a text from him saying, call me, because they're  supposed to call him at two.  Yeah.  And he said, call me at five.  I had my room changed.  I moved to the op.  They couldn't have moved me farther away from the parade.  And the lady downstairs didn't understand why you didn't want to enjoy the parade from  your window.  You don't want to watch the parade? 
[00:32:00]  You fucking don't, lady.  I want to sleep.  I was so angry that she asked you that.  And that nice Harrisburg attitude.  I'm sure they're just overly nice there.  They were all nice, man.  You don't want to watch the parade.  What type of question is that?  Do you think he would say, huh?  Well, now that you posed the question that way, yes, I would like to watch the parade.  I thought you should ask.  I want to get into another thing.  I got a text from Jimmy because you guys, I guess, were laughing hysterically and wanted  to bring me into your discussion or something.  I don't know. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, you were making fun of E-Rock.  And all of a sudden, I got a text from Jimmy.  He called everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But all is good.  We were just teasing E-Rock and having a good laugh at his expense.  What's the problem?  So just he cleared it.  But just getting his thing signed.  But it was cleared in advance.  He did the right thing.  Yeah.  He just loves celebrities so much.  You guys were enjoying that fact as you were driving to Harrisburg.  How much?  Good laughs.  Were you laughing pretty hard?  Yeah.  But that comes from you.  You like a good autograph and a good picture, too.  Absolutely. 
[00:33:00]  That's why I can't judge him.  So who's worse?  Hard to say because I do it, too, man.  I think E-Rock's worse because he'll ask for multiple things to get signed, whereas I won't.  Like, I'm selfish.  I only get my shit done.  E-Rock is actually a problem.  E-Rock is worse with it, but he's probably a better person.  All of a sudden, like, yeah, he gets multiple things signed, and then all of a sudden he  hands you something that is, like, so fucking cool.  He gives me a signed Cars DVD for my son.  Yeah, but I mean, like, Larry the Cable Guy signed the Cars DVD.  Oh.  What the fuck did I do to deserve this, E-Rock?  But he's only giving that to your son as an excuse for him to get it. 
[00:33:30]  So he can go, like, ah, I'm doing it for Hope's Kid, too.  Right.  If you wanted a Larry the Cable Guy thing signed, he was on your show.  You could probably hook it up without E-Rock doing anything.  I know, but I'm lazy when it comes to that stuff.  I just assume we're going to do this forever, and obviously we're not, and then it's going  to be like, fuck, I had all those opportunities, and I blew it.  So maybe.  I don't care about autographs as much, but it was a nice, it was very nice of E-Rock  to do that.  Yeah, we were having some good laughs.  And that will stay in my house, by the way, E-Rock.  I will not be shipping that out. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, you're not going to put it in a garage somewhere?  I get to visit my Islander's poster this weekend.  Poster.  You're still calling it a poster.  Poster, that's right.  My brother is having Thanksgiving, so I'm going to get to visit the poster this weekend.  Oh, that's great.  Hey, remember when you said you were going to put it back into your house?  Oh.  Whoops.  Whoops.  The kid takes over the house, makes it hard to put any of your shit up.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, did CM Punk win?  Yeah, he won the belt.  Oh, he did.  Good, good.  I won the championship.  Yeah.  That actually reminded me that we were also talking in the car that Jim is too, he doesn't 
[00:34:30]  want to sound mean, but we brought up the fact that E-Rock is definitely worse than  Jim, because at least sometimes the celebrities are also fans of Jim and know who he is because  he's talent, whereas there's never been a celebrity who's been like, oh, E-Rock, I'm a big fan  of you.  I didn't point that out.  There's been two.  Yeah.  That recognized me?  Very few.  CM Punk recognized you.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a big fan.  And now he's the big WWE champion.  Yes, he is.  Justin Bieber, by the way, Liam is such a great guy.  He got my picture taken by Justin. 
[00:35:00]  He got my picture signed for Justin Bieber.  Right.  And there's a picture of Liam on Yahoo News.  Handing your picture over?  Getty Images snapped a fucking photo of that.  That's funny.  And it's Liam, and he goes, they got a picture of me getting your photo signed from Justin.  So it makes you look like Liam is the big Justin Bieber fan.  That's hilarious.  Some fucking, because Liam I love, but he's a creepy looking man.  Yeah.  And is he still wearing the two different sneakers?  He's wearing eight different outfits at any given time.  He's the weirdest guy on fucking serious.  But he's, it was a very funny. 
[00:35:30]  People love marching band Jimmy.  Oh, it drives me nuts, dude.  Oh, there it is right there.  Look at Liam.  Who are you signing this for?  Oh, that's hilarious.  Bieber's signing my picture.  Now I've got to get a copy of that.  So you're not going to be checking out the Thanksgiving Day Parade then?  No, I don't.  A lot of bands.  Don't like parades.  They enjoy their bands.  Thanksgiving Day Parade is a little different, because A, it's New York, and it's a massive  event.  It's a little different.  But by and large, I've always hated them.  I've never liked them.  I can't.  Like, as a kid, I didn't enjoy them.  Even the balloons? 
[00:36:00]  Especially the balloons.  Unless they're knocking a lamppost over into some lady's head.  I don't like them.  They just do nothing for you.  Well, the problem is you've got to stand on your tippy toes the entire time, because  you're too lazy to get there six hours ahead of time to get a good seat.  That's what you've got to do, too, for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, for the most part.  Nobody's ever been in a hotel room surprised by the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Like, everybody knows what's happening.  Dude, if you were in a hotel room and those balloons were flying by, that would be cool.  Yes.  Yeah, but you know...  That would absolutely be cool to check out.  You'd know what was happening.  Like, that's...  You'd know what's happening.  But most of us are ten rows back with our kid, and you're trying to, like, go tippy-toe 
[00:36:30]  on something.  That looks great, that picture.  What?  Oh, Liam?  I'm a big fan.  I've got to get that.  Liam looks like a kid-toucher.  I guess what he'd be having is Justin Bieber picture signed.  Let's isolate that for Liam.  Sorry.  Sorry, Liam.  No, Liam knows.  Sorry, Liam.  Yeah.  Hi.  He's a good boy, though.  But Harrisburg was very good.  A lot of hardcore radio fans there.  Nice.  Which was nice.  Good to hear.  A couple of drunks.  Yeah.  A couple of... 
[00:37:00]  Oh, I get fucking nasty with a couple of drunks.  While you were doing your show?  Yeah, we had the security guys we had.  The guy in the middle, his name was Dwayne.  He was a black comic from, like, Lansing, Michigan.  Turns out he's a state trooper.  Which I like, because, you know, because Kenny wasn't there, and Kenny makes you feel very safe.  For all of Kenny's lunacy, Kenny is a very, very good guy to be away with.  Absolutely.  But this guy was a trooper and a big dude, and the security guys they had for me were both fucking correction officers from central Pennsylvania.  So they were these two big fucking country-looking white dudes who were absolutely a problem if they needed to be. 
[00:37:30]  So I felt very safe there with those guys.  Otherwise, I would have had to go up to drunk people and say, would you please keep it down?  Do you know how fucking awful it was to walk into a situation thinking Sam was my fucking...  Yeah.  Sam had your back?  Oh, how awful.  I just would have been just...  Well, I'm getting beaten, him running for help.  I'm going to buy a CD or something.  I don't know.  Yeah, sir, we'll give you this if you stop fucking punching Jim's face.  What would you do, Sam? 
[00:38:00]  Would you hit somebody with a chair, go with, like, WWE on them?  I would just try to find the club owner so I could blame somebody else for not doing it.  Yeah.  Because there's no way I would be able to protect Jim in any type of physical confrontation.  No, no, you're pretty much...  Yeah, I would want to avoid it so I didn't get hurt.  What happened to the guys?  What guys?  That were acting up.  They got a couple of them thrown out.  I hated them.  If you guys are listening today, I fucking hated you.  And it's only a couple of you.  But it was not because you yelled out a little bit because you were so drunk and you wouldn't stop.  And I fucking hated you. 
[00:38:30]  There's one guy who looks like with his stupid glasses and he looked like a fucking, I said, a King of the Hill character.  I hated you.  Is he a fan of the show?  I don't know.  Or a fan of yours?  I hope he didn't live through the weekend.  Wow.  I hated him.  Wow, that's hateable.  Just because he was just talking the whole time to some fucking dumb broad.  And he was so unaware of what an absolute jerk off he...  It's almost like I'm looking at that guy.  I'm like, you're everything that's wrong with the public.  And you know the difference between someone having a good time at your show and just fucking disrupting everything.  There is a fine line between the two. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, somebody who gets a little carried away and is yapping.  We had a lot of them because I attract people who enjoy a drink or two.  So you understand that comes with the territory.  And I don't hate a couple of people who are having a good time and getting a little overzealous.  Because then if you ask them to quiet down, I never want to have people thrown out, dude.  I fucking hate it.  You never want them to talk.  Yeah, of course not.  So, I know the difference.  But this guy was the entire show.  And the crowd, when the one guy was asked to leave, the crowd applauded.  The crowd claps when you leave.  Yeah, yeah.  That's saying something. 
[00:39:30]  That means you're the problem.  Fuck yeah, man.  You get to watch any football?  No.  It was a dumb week for football because my Jets played Thursday and lost horribly to the fucking Broncos and Tebow.  I still haven't forgotten.  Your Cowboys beat the Redskins, Jimmy.  Cool.  I believe they're in first now.  Oh, good.  With the Giants.  Oh, great.  Good.  Still not in.  Every Monday, I kind of try to pull you back in.  The Cowboys are having an okay year right now.  Oh, no. 
[00:40:00]  What is he doing?  No.  Oh, how fucking hilarious.  No, you can't take a picture with a lesbian.  Steve Blatter's picture with Justin Bieber is hilariously creepy.  That could be the creepiest picture.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that is.  Justin Bieber absolutely looks like Rachel Maddow.  Yeah.  He looks like a lesbian girl.  Could you please send me that, whether we got a screen cap or whatever, even if it says Getty Images. 
[00:40:30]  I have to.  Let's put that on a shirt.  I have to fucking put that in a different background on that.  I got to fucking.  Why don't we make shirts out of them?  Put them in Thailand or something.  Coke Logic made it.  I had my picture with Bieber was on a set, and he actually put my hair.  He gave me and Bieber the same hairdo, and then he wrote Club Boy in the back.  I had to be careful to print out the wrong one to get signed.  Club Boy.  Oh, God.  Wow, he's tiny. 
[00:41:00]  How old is he now?  He's old enough to.  Well, this was actually a couple years ago.  He's probably 17 now.  All right.  So he might have shot up.  Oh, okay.  There's no way he's taking care of Selena Gomez.  There's no fucking way he knows what to do with that.  She is sexy, man.  Anyway, you're Cowboys.  Six and four, Jimmy.  First place with the Giants.  Are they six and four good for them?  They should probably have a better record if they had a quarterback.  Same record as the Giants, who lost to the Eagles.  Backup QB, Vince Young in for Michael Vick, and they beat the fucking Giants, man. 
[00:41:30]  What happened to Michael Vick?  He's got them broken ribs.  He's got something going on, yeah.  Something.  And then the stupid Bills, who they were my second team this year.  Everyone's got a second team.  Oh, Bills.  Bills got their ass handed to them by the Dolphins, 35-8.  Packers still undefeated.  Wow.  Go Pack Goal.  Go Pack Goal.  Go Pack Goal.  Go Pack Goal.  But don't count out those 49ers there, Anthony.  Nine and one.  They beat the Cardinals 23-7.  I wouldn't count them out. 
[00:42:00]  What?  They are?  I like the fucking 49ers, man.  Yeah.  No, I'm taking a peek at the 49ers.  I think I'm at 49ers over the Packers in the end.  How's Joe Montana look?  He's looking pretty good this year.  Looking good.  That's it for football, I guess.  Colts didn't play, so we can't make fun of them this Monday.  Yeah.  Any other big games there, Travis, if you're around?  If it's worth talking about, come on in here.  Why the fuck are we working today? 
[00:42:30]  I don't know.  We're dedicated.  Yeah, that's it.  We're very dedicated employees.  Travis, I have to work.  Yeah, that's right.  That's it for football?  No more big games.  No more big games?  All right.  Yeah, that's right.  We got food?  Why don't we take a break?  I like the sound of that.  We got Corso Curson on ESPN.  It was great.  Yeah, I saw that clip pretty good.  And speaking of cursing, you know, I assume a lot of people hate Rex Ryan,  but what the NFL is trying to do to Rex Ryan, enough already.  We'll discuss it next, okay? 
[00:43:00]  That is crazy.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  It's the OPN Entry Show.  The OPN Entry Show. 
[00:43:30]  Staying alive.  Staying alive.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Staying alive.  Staying alive.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Staying alive.  Get in topical.  Hold up. 
[00:44:00]  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  What do we got going on today, E?  Well, two things, actually.  Oh.  The Verrazano Bridge opened 47 years ago, which is featured in Saturday Night Fever.  Yeah.  And, uh.  The fuck?  Robin Gibb is dying of liver cancer.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Really?  Which one is Robin Gibb?  I need a visual.  The one with the beard.  Not very important. 
[00:44:30]  He's not the important one.  Oh.  He's got to be kind of important.  Oh, he's that guy, yeah.  That guy's dying?  Fuck.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  Nice wig.  I thought he was the one with the beard.  No.  Oh, the guy with the beard is, uh.  He's the main guy.  Uh.  He's the what?  Maurice.  Maurice.  No.  Maurice.  Oh, yeah.  Barry?  Is it Barry?  Barry.  Yeah.  Barry?  Oh, those Gibbs.  So, Robin Gibbs got liver cancer. 
[00:45:00]  Gravely ill.  Fuck.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Stupid song you like?  I kind of like.  I like the BDs, man.  Yeah, you don't want to tell too many people you like that, though.  Lights on Broadway is a good song.  The old BDs.  I just gotta get a message to you.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.  That's a good time.  Turn this up. 
[00:45:30]  Ah.  Yeah.  Take that polyester look.  Yeah.  When my sister was little, she met the Bee Gees.  Oh.  And my mom had to talk to her before she left because she was afraid that they'd give her  drugs.  The Bee Gees.  I think one of them had like just gotten into drug trouble or maybe one of their brothers  had died of an overdose or something.  I don't know.  But.  Your mom rules.  Our neighbor's friends knew the Bee Gees very well. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And they invited my sister when she was like four or five to go to dinner with them.  Who thought the Bee Gees were going to give a five-year-old drugs?  My mom sat down with my sister and she said, now, if any of their friends, because my sister  didn't know they were the Bee Gees.  So she goes, if any of their friends offer you anything to eat or whatever, don't take  it if you don't know what it is.  Because she was afraid they were going to give her pills or something.  Who gives quaaludes to a five-year-old? 
[00:46:30]  The Bee Gees, apparently.  Apparently, yeah.  If you listen to Bobby, the Bee Gees in the late 80s.  That's really funny.  We were coming back.  I was sexting and sending dirty pictures.  And just Sam was saying how upset his mother would be if she just knew the danger I was  putting her son in.  Oh, yeah.  Doing 75 miles an hour at night, fucking texting, sending pictures of my cock.  As you're driving?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was dirty texting the whole time.  But I told him, if we get into an accident and we just end up paralyzed, my mother will 
[00:47:00]  be so upset when she finds out it's because Jim Norton was dirty texting while he was driving  her son home.  Instead of doing 10 and 2 for little Sammy.  Yeah, I just wanted Sam's mom to know that.  When I drive, I text a lot.  Jesus.  And it's 3 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah, I'm kind of looking at the phone.  I'm doing at least 75.  And Sam is there, helpless.  Why didn't Sam drive at that point?  I almost asked Sam to drive.  So he could focus on your sexting. 
[00:47:30]  No, but I like the idea that we could be killed.  It made it more exciting.  Which one is this?  Nights on Broadway.  These whiny Bee Gees.  That's a good song, right?  Yeah.  They did have a unique kind of sound, didn't they? 
[00:48:00]  Very harmonic.  Yeah, Jimmy Fallon does a good, very good, I think.  He does?  Is that the one he does?  Yeah.  He's good at mimicking people.  Yeah.  You see, it's Jim Morrison.  It's pretty damn good.  But my mom can feel a little more comfortable, because half of Jim's texts, he used Siri.  So I got to hear half of his dirty conversation. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God.  Siri for texting.  For the dirty texting.  Dirty texting.  You wanted to drag Sam into your world, I think.  It was just fun.  No, it was just to be alive.  I didn't want to die.  Just to be alive.  Yeah, it was worth it.  Very nice.  At the box office, that damn twilight.  140.  Let's just call it 140 million over the weekend, Ant.  Yes.  Breaking Dawn.  Breaking Dawn, part one.  Part one?  Yes.  I don't think I've ever seen...  No, I can say I've never seen a Twilight movie.  Are they good?  First three were okay.  Never saw them. 
[00:49:00]  I did see them.  No, Jimmy has seen them.  Why did you see them?  My girlfriend screamed at me.  She's like, you're a fucking tween.  I bought them on iTunes.  Were they good?  They weren't as...  I actually thought they'd be better than they were, but they were good.  They were a little too...  I knew they were teenage romance movies, but I forgot how teenage melodrama kind of annoys  me.  Yeah.  But they were actually decent films.  Look, man.  They weren't bad.  I was all in with Harry Potter.  No problem admitting that.  I've never seen those with Lord of the Rings, the Twilight Zone.  Lord of the Rings blows them both away. 
[00:49:30]  I like Lord of the Rings, yeah.  Fucking Lord of the Rings.  Why haven't you seen Lord of the Rings?  It doesn't interest me.  But I'll see it just because...  You've got to see...  What's his name?  Filmmaking is ridiculous.  Yeah.  I don't like that type of stuff.  It's not my stuff.  It's not your cup of tea?  Yeah.  I don't like Pixar movies and that shit.  Pixar movies are great, too.  Yeah.  I watched the one up.  It was okay.  But that type of stuff doesn't do much to me.  I watched Toy Story 2 for the 100th time.  Oh, boy.  I've never seen one of those either.  I probably should.  Toy Story movies are great. 
[00:50:00]  You like the Toy Story movies, right?  Yeah.  Sure.  So you've got Twilight with $140 million, and then a big drop-off, Happy Feet at 22, Immortals,  and then Jack and Jill, $12 million.  So people are still kind of seeing Jack and Jill.  How much has Jack and Jill made so far?  $41 million.  That's not a lot for a sound movie, though.  No.  And it looks like it says production budget was $79 million, so it's halfway there. 
[00:50:30]  They'll make that back, though.  They'll make it up in foreign and DVD or a couple more weeks here.  Digital delivery.  But word of mouth does kill a movie sometimes, and it's like this one apparently is getting  murdered.  Oh, yeah.  Is Adam going to come in and talk about it?  If you had to interview Jill first?  Wait a minute.  I can't imagine.  Hey.  Fuck Jack and Jill.  Now, Adam's going to come in as Jill, and he will not break character.  So you just have to talk to Jill.  Imagine that one. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Would that be great.  We're just jealous.  Are we?  Yeah.  Another big movie for Adam Sandler.  Another piece of shite.  How is she going?  Marrying a vampire.  Just stop it.  You know how good a vampire must fuck you?  This is stupid.  What do you mean he's marrying?  Who's marrying a vampire?  Oh, there's the wolf boy.  Oh, no.  There's the man in the wheel.  And the wolf boy is running, and he's got wolf toes or something.  The wolf boy.  Oh, God.  The wolf. 
[00:51:30]  Look at the other man reading.  Wait, how does he turn into the wolf?  He just runs, and he becomes a wolf boy.  He turns into a werewolf.  The special effects on that sucked.  All of a sudden, it was just a wolf.  Yeah, it's a wolf.  What happened to the transformation part?  No, a real American werewolf in London.  Edward Cullen is marrying Bella, whose last name I don't remember.  That's the character you made.  Yes.  Well, Bella.  But we'll start with forever. 
[00:52:00]  Whoa.  It was quite a fucking.  Yeah.  How is he on the sun?  Yeah, he can.  How's he fucking?  He goes to school.  Is he a daywalker?  What is that about?  He fucks around the rag.  That's when he eats her pussy.  Oh, she's pregnant.  That's great.  With little wolf boy?  No, vampire.  No, that's vampire boy.  Oh, vampire.  Wolf boy loves her too, though.  And it's weird because he's stuck in her ass.  That's what the whole thing of this movie was.  He gave her what he called a shitter rump, and he can't believe she got knocked up. 
[00:52:30]  How did she go to Thanksgiving dinner knowing she's pregnant with a vampire as a kid?  I don't know.  Well, she wanted to be a vampire, and the family discussed it, and they didn't want to make her a vampire.  Yes.  He didn't want to subject her.  To that eternal damnation.  To that damnation.  Yeah.  This is going great!  And there was some bad vampires are after her.  Be more funny!  But the vampire council, which kind of wasn't happy with Edward Cullen, I believe. 
[00:53:00]  I don't care!  And the wolf boy.  The wolf boy.  Who turns into, because his tribes have always fought the Cullens.  Right.  Are, are, are, bite, bite, bite.  And they're, uh, battling over.  Oh.  The wolf boy is trying to protect.  It's like the wolf boy and the vampire, who are sworn enemies.  Yes.  Are working together, because they both love Bella.  Oh.  And they're fighting the bad vampires.  Who want to do her part. 
[00:53:30]  Who the vampire council, I think, is happier coming.  And there's the Indian man's in the wheelchair.  And then there's the wolf boy running.  Um.  They go to school.  I don't care!  I don't care!  Shut up!  I don't care!  He has no shirt a lot of times.  He runs without his shirt.  But they see the vampire and Bella were up in the mountains.  B.C.  They smell Bella when she's around.  The bad vampire is kind of sent by the vampire council. 
[00:54:00]  They don't smell her.  So when Edward wants to keep Bella away from the vampires,  he knows that they can smell her.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  The vampire council.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  This.  Oh, this is stupid.  Once you were like, oh, even a member of the vampire family,  like, should cut her finger or something.  And they're like, ah, and they want to bite. 
[00:54:30]  And they have to run away because they don't want to hurt Bella.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  The vampire council.  No, that's not the family.  Oh, no, no.  I mean the family.  Right.  And they had to, what was it, the brother-in-law?  Jimmy actually knows about this.  It was for something.  How did he keep his composure over that?  He actually knows about this, though.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  And she cut herself, I think, and a member of the family went crazy because of the smell 
[00:55:00]  of blood.  Yes.  What happens with the smell of blood?  Oh, well, vampires kind of go a little crazy over that shit.  Makes them just nutty.  And they've got to go biting and drinking.  And I think they had to restrain.  What happened?  I don't remember, but they were afraid that, like, for her to be around them would put  her in danger.  Yeah.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Well, now we have the fourth one called Breaking Dawn, where apparently what happens is she gets 
[00:55:30]  some vampire dick.  Yeah.  And she just makes, of course, it makes her pregnant immediately.  And being a vampire, he doesn't think to pull out and shoot her human face.  Right.  I bet it was his pre-cum, too.  I bet he did pull out.  His vampire seat is probably so potent, he was probably poking her in the dumper, and  a little pre-cum fucking snuck out in the night, of course, and crept down her taint  and fucking just went in and assaulted her eggs, bit their little egg stems, made vampire 
[00:56:00]  boobies.  Kid's going to pop out of her pussy and just bite her clit.  This is a great question coming in.  Sure.  Tito from Ohio.  Tito.  Yeah.  Have you guys seen all of the 40-year-old women in line to cream their jeans over these  teenage kids?  Yeah.  It's a double standard.  We all know that.  Oh.  Older women could, like, you know, get all wet and bothered by teenage boys.  And gushy.  But older guys and teenage girls, oh boy, that's not good. 
[00:56:30]  What about coaches and pre-teen boys?  Of course.  How's that work out?  Really well, thank God.  Oh, well.  So, Jimmy, I can't believe you haven't seen the new Twilight.  I almost went rolling and told me there was a screening.  I think I was just too tired and I had to set that night.  Had your period?  Yeah, I couldn't.  I'm fighting with my boyfriend.  No, I will see it, but they're not, they're not, I was hoping they'd be better.  I didn't mind the pre-teen, like, the teen angle, but it's just a little too childish 
[00:57:00]  for me, but the vampire stuff was kind of okay.  It didn't suck.  I'll tell you what made me want to see it.  It was Ozzy, before he goes on, parodies whatever the fucking hottest movies are, and  he puts them, he green screens himself in.  It's always very funny.  Like, you know, when Gump was popular in 95, Forrest is talking to him and he's sitting  on the bench and he's just going, shut the fuck up.  You know, so he's always in these funny scenes.  And the one that he did with her was he was Edward Cullen.  And, like, in the movie, Edward opens up his shirt and his body is just glistening, like, 
[00:57:30]  really weird, like, glitter on it.  Of course.  But, you know, in Ozzy's, of course, he opens it up and he's got tits and she's looking at  Ozzy's tits.  It's just creepy.  But I wanted to see it because it didn't look like a cool movie.  That scene of him running up the hill carrying his chick, I'm like, yeah, I would fucking  see this.  Hmm.  All right.  You're wild.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I got them on iTunes.  I just watched them while I was working out, which was slightly humiliating.  You know what movie I saw? 
[00:58:00]  Oh, that's Ozzy and Jersey Shore.  I saw Dane Cook's new movie.  I did, too.  I know you did.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  I liked it.  I liked it, too.  It was a bizarre vibe to it, but I liked it.  Dane did a great job.  The acting was really good.  I liked everybody in it.  It's an ensemble piece where everyone's lives are interconnected, kind of like Crash was.  It reminded me of Crash, and it had a tone like Crash, too, and I can't describe what  it was.  It's just a feeling, or was it the camera work? 
[00:58:30]  I wonder if anybody from Crash worked on the visual effects in this movie, because there  was something about the tone of it that just reminded me.  Yeah.  Oh, you know who's in it, too?  She plays Dane's wife, and I was very jealous.  It was the chick that played Julia, or whatever, Julie in Lost, a beautiful Sawyer's girlfriend.  Oh, right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think this movie, well, it'll do well.  Yeah.  It's definitely not what you would expect.  It's not a mainstream type of movie, I don't think, right?  But it'll do well.  Answers to nothing.  Yeah.  Dane's the biggest name in it.  Wow. 
[00:59:00]  And he did a really good job, man.  Yeah, I thought Dane's acting was great in it.  He's got conflict in it, and you really do wonder what's on his mind.  Is this a turn to dramatic acting for Dane Cook?  He's good, man.  He can act.  He did a lot of the stuff that he's done that's...  He plays a good creep.  Yeah, he really does.  Because he's kind of creepy at first in this movie, and then you realize he's a guy just  struggling with some shit.  Yeah.  And it's not a...  I opened...  Dude, the opening scene, I thought it's going to be a comedy, because the opening scene...  Oh, right.  And it seemed like it was going to be a comedy, but it's not. 
[00:59:30]  No, Dane Cook is not trying to make anyone laugh in this movie.  No.  No, no, he's good.  At all.  What is Rotten Tomatoes saying?  And then you got kind of a kid touch a storyline.  Yeah, some kid went missing, that type of thing.  Nothing wrong with that.  Uh, where are we at with Rotten Tomatoes on this movie?  Rotten Tomatoes.  And Dane's coming in to promote this soon?  I think so, yeah.  Nice.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, I think he's coming in next week.  No, probably no one has seen it yet.  What's the 62% on the right side, though, Sam? 
[01:00:00]  Want to see.  Want to see?  Want to see?  They do a want to see now?  Anything to keep you coming back.  Yeah, before the movie comes out.  62% have not seen it, yet would see it.  All right.  All right.  How many would see it in case of leaving him a fire?  How do they describe the movie, Sam?  Because we have done a horrible job doing just that.  We really have not sold it well.  I don't want to give anything away.  A synopsis.  Against the backdrop of a missing girl case, lost souls throughout Los Angeles search for  meaning and redemption and affect each other in ways they don't always see. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  I like when movies do that weird thing where you don't realize that characters you've been  watching in different vignettes know each other or they cross behind screens.  I like weird shit like that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, Pulp Fiction did that.  Right, driving by and all of a sudden you see what's happening here and then that Bruce  Wilson character rides by or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  So they do that in Boogie Nights, too.  Yep.  Like after the blowjob scene, then you see Don Cheadle drive by on the way to the donut  shop.  I just love this weird inner crossings. 
[01:01:00]  That's some smart filmmaking.  It really is.  I would just go, I would write a movie and I would actually write a sign that says next  scene.  I don't think that would work.  No, it hasn't.  A little ham handed.  It has.  You guys see the Lee Corso clip yet?  Yes.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to sound informed.  I don't like sounding uninformed.  You dropped the F-bomb on ESPN?  No.  Why is this still a big deal?  I don't really understand this.  I don't.  I think we could all handle the fuck.  No.  We certainly could all handle the fuck. 
[01:01:30]  That's great advice for the Sandusky case, too.  Yeah.  I think we could handle all words on TV, but for some reason, you can't.  Here's Lee Corso.  Red, white, and blue.  USA!  It's a college game day.  They're all having a good time.  And he puts on, what, the mascot head?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:02:00]  He goes, ah, fuck it, and puts it on.  He had a megaphone first.  Yeah.  And he threw the megaphone.  He said, ah, fuck it.  And then he put the hat on.  And it's cable, anyway.  So it's not.  Any repercussions?  Well, then you get this.  I don't know.  Just a bullshit apology.  Earlier today on College Game Day, while picking the SMU Houston game, I got a bit excited  and used an expeditive I shouldn't have used.  I apologize, and I can promise it won't happen again.  Yeah, because they said if it happens again, you're fired.  Who cares?  You never want to have to start by saying, during some event, I something, you know? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to, during, I said, who's watching, like, a college football pregame show,  and then they're going to be bothered by the word fuck.  I guess I'm a mother of one of the players.  Come on.  Ah, it was very, ah, no, this isn't professional.  Come on.  Come on.  Yeah, I don't mind it, and I don't watch. 
[01:03:00]  Speaking of fuck, Rex Ryan.  Yeah, what the hell happened there?  They're talking between $75,000 and $100,000.  For what?  He's leaving the field at halftime, Pat's Jets game, and, you know, and a fan was aggravating him.  Yeah.  Was basically, you know, egging him on, so to speak.  Yeah.  And so Rex said what?  Fuck you or whatever.  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck for him.  Go fuck yourself.  Go fuck yourself.  Something you can't really even fuck up. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  And now the league wants to fine him $75,000 to $100,000.  Rex Ryan, if you hate him, that's fine, but the guy was minding his own business and just leaving the field for halftime,  and, you know, this fan was trying to get a reaction out of Rex Ryan, and he got it.  And it wasn't broadcast.  Unbelievable.  The NFL sucks with their stupid fucking rules.  They want to keep it, you know, family-oriented.  Fuck the family-oriented shit.  I'm a father, and I say that, and fuck the family-oriented shit. 
[01:04:00]  It's my job to explain it to the little one.  Of course.  I don't need you to fucking sanitizing everything.  They'll hear shut the fuck up.  Of course they will.  Eventually.  Of course.  They'll caters.  I completely agree with you on that, where, you know, the entertainment business in general caters toward families and the little ones,  and that's just stupid.  And we sacrifice our own entertainment.  This is Zan's rap, but I completely agree with it. 
[01:04:30]  And that's why people are, you know, in droves turning away from this family entertainment,  getting their own shit delivered on Netflix and whatever you want.  You don't have to deal with this fucking fake bullshit.  Man, now you get prayer circles at football games.  God, really?  T-bowing, come on.  Huh?  You got a T-bow.  No, every team does it.  They kneel at center field before, after, during, after every play.  It's, you know? 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  They used to beat the shit out of each other.  And dance on your lifeless body after they hit you so goddamn hard.  Now they kneel and pray.  Now they pray.  It's the NFL.  Start acting like it.  So it's ridiculous, right?  Yeah.  Why fucking fight him?  I wonder if that's a lot to him.  75 to 100?  You never want to cough up 75 grand.  Dude, you miss 100 grand.  Yeah.  You never want to cough that up.  That's a lot.  It's a write-off, but that's a lot of fucking money, man. 
[01:05:30]  That's a lot.  10 grand you don't miss.  100 grand to move.  Where does that go?  Where does it go?  Who gets that money?  Uh, I, somebody tweeted, I don't know if it's true, it helps old players.  Oh, yeah?  I'm not really sure if that's true, though.  I don't know.  It sounded true, so that's why I just said it.  Charitable contribution, then.  But, you're in the NFL and now you've got fans going after you and you can't say shit?  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I would love to see the coach losing his mind.  I can understand if you swing on him, maybe. 
[01:06:00]  Huh?  I can understand if you swing on him, maybe.  If you're just, uh...  Verbally going at it with each other?  I love all that shit.  Love it.  Hmm.  By the way, did anybody watch?  Yes, I did.  It was amazing.  One of the best I've ever seen.  Absolutely.  What are we talking about?  The, um, the, the, the, the porn, the, the sequel to Leather Boys.  No.  It ended, it ended.  It was a surprise ending, Jim.  With Deke.  Leather Boys ended with Deke. 
[01:06:30]  He's laying in the, on the pool of his own cum.  Yeah.  And three men are jerking you off in his face.  And you're like, oh no, is the black guy going to come in and fuck his mouth first?  But I'm glad you appreciate that as much as I do.  UFC?  Please.  Please turn this into UFC.  Yes, it was UFC.  I did not see UFC, unfortunately.  Arguably.  I, everyone's saying how great it was.  It, it, it, it's in the top three or four fights I've ever seen.  It might be the best UFC five I've ever seen.  Dan Henderson against Shogun Hua.  Oh, wow.  I was like, eh, I really didn't want to see it.  And, uh, and, and Silva against Kung Lee, eventually Silva against Kung Lee was an amazing 
[01:07:00]  fight before.  Dan fucking Henderson.  He's 41 years old.  Wow.  He's probably in the top three toughest fucking lunkheads on the planet.  Lunkheads.  What a frightening tough guy he is.  He beat up Fedor.  And, uh, fuck is he, he's un-knockoutable.  You can't knock him out.  Wow.  He's un-knockoutable, Dan Henderson.  Jesus, look at this animal.  He do, he looks, he looks like, almost like a fucking guy from West Virginia.  Like, he's just got that face, like, uh, from Deliverance. 
[01:07:30]  Like a hillbilly.  Oh.  Doing some wrestling.  What an amazing.  Was that the fight of the night, Jimmy?  It's, it's the fight of the year.  I mean, I couldn't.  It was that good.  I couldn't believe.  Really?  How fucking.  Dan Henderson, he, again, he's got a tremendous punch.  And, uh, he's never been knocked out.  He's lost fights, but he's never been knocked out.  Wow.  What a great, great UFC fucking fight that was, man.  I didn't see that.  I kept thinking, I wish they'd show that on Fox, because it was longer.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Um, even though Fox, they did great with the ratings. 
[01:08:00]  They did, like, six million people.  But I'm sure Dana White wouldn't have minded this on, on Fox.  Yeah, this just would have roped in some people a little bit more.  There was a good mix of jiu-jitsu, um, on the ground, fucking ground and pound, and some  just brutal hits.  Oh, he's bleeding.  Yeah, already.  The fight's fucking a minute and a half old.  Jesus.  Hey, I heard, uh, Uriah Faber had a good fight, too, huh?  Yes, he did.  He won, I think, in the second round.  I heard he, uh, did all right.  Yeah, yeah, Faber, uh, I forget who he fought.  Who else fought?  Bowles.  Um, fuck.  Uh, Ryan Bader won a great fight. 
[01:08:30]  He's got, he's, he's like a light heavyweight, and he's got an eight-pack.  Why the f*** did I rent this?  Well, it was Saturday, right?  Yes, it was.  Oh, I was busy, that's why.  I was away.  But I, you know, I watched it when I got home.  I went to a thing Kenny had.  A thing.  A thing.  Kenny had a thing, and I went.  It was nice.  Had a little steak.  Yeah, I wanted to go to that.  With Kenny's family.  It was his wife's birthday, which was very nice.  Kenny loves Morton's.  Holy f***.  Oh, he does.  It's the best.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's obsessed with Morton's.  He loves it.  I just want to watch. 
[01:09:00]  This is what real fighting is, Sam, by the way.  I see.  This is real, not like the fake thing you went to.  Yeah.  Big talk when CM Punk's not in here.  Oof.  Oh.  He was right there, and you asked him what it was like winning the title.  Oh, no.  He called you out.  Oh, no.  Did he say that?  You asked him.  I didn't say what it's like.  What did I say?  I said, well.  Well, something to that effect.  But here's the deal.  You look at CM Punk, and you know he's a problem. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  You know he would be a problem if you said the wrong thing.  He seemed like a nice man, though.  No, I liked him.  I liked him a lot.  He was very down to earth.  I liked his honesty.  I liked how he was just kind of letting it go.  I have not liked one of those wrestlers.  They've all been, every one of them that's come in has been great.  Like, they're some of my favorite interviews.  Those guys, UFC guys and boxers, I like them so much more than football players.  I like these guys that wrestlers so much more.  We don't even get, like, sports stars that are playing at the time. 
[01:10:00]  We didn't have him once in a while.  We had What's-His-Name, where he said his name wrong the whole time.  Oh, Terrell Owens.  He didn't take his sunglasses off?  What'd he say?  Oh, God.  Wait.  Terrell.  We said Terrell.  It's Terrell.  No, it's Terrell.  No, it's Terrell.  Oh, and you said Terrell.  Yeah, because the whole world says Terrell.  Of course.  The whole fucking world says Terrell.  Terrell.  And he was correcting us.  Stop it.  How about Pete?  Terrell.  Bob.  Fucking asshole.  Bill.  He was not a nice guy, huh? 
[01:10:30]  No.  He was just, you know, he was there.  His grandmother had Alzheimer's.  I think that was the charity he was promoting.  Yeah.  But we were on our best behavior, and he was just like, ugh.  He was thinking, why am I even here?  That's a good attitude.  I think most of them are just boring.  Honestly, I think most of them are boring.  They don't, I just don't enjoy what they talk about.  Jocks.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Sherry in New Jersey.  Sherry.  What?  Hey.  Hey.  I was just calling because I teach sixth grade, and the kids curse all the time. 
[01:11:00]  You know, not in the classroom, but out in the hallways, I hear tons of the F words.  Of course.  And it's mainly because they hear it from their parents.  I mean, they're sanitizing TV.  They can do it all they want, but the kids are going to curse.  Potty mouth parents.  But if you really sat down a middle school kid, they don't care.  No, it's not affecting them in any way.  It's these goody two-shoe asshole adults that think it still matters.  Yes.  And then in the end, you give the words more power by putting a spotlight on them. 
[01:11:30]  I know.  And I mean, I have to stop them in the hallways if I hear it.  I have to say something, but, you know.  Why do you have to even say anything in the hallway?  Language.  That's a dumb teacher.  Language.  You know, I hear it.  You know, I just said, oh, I heard that.  And that's really it.  I mean, it's not like I can do anything.  You realize as a kid when you get older that you can't go to a job interview and start spouting the fucking F-bomb and shit like that. 
[01:12:00]  You just, it's kind of, it's one of those things that you like doing when you're a kid.  When you were growing up and you learned about that word, you're like, oh, wow, this is kind of cool.  Yeah.  You felt kind of cool when you used it.  Fuck you.  Fuck this.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Yeah.  They sound like idiots when they're using it, probably.  Of course they do.  Some little 11-year-old, 12-year-old.  Ah, fucking asshole.  Some little shit.  Yeah.  They've seen my things that I've heard sometimes.  Yeah.  At 11 years old. 
[01:12:30]  How about we make sure they don't blow each other and let them fucking curse?  Hey, wow.  Why are you interrupting?  What type of teaching do you do?  I teach English.  Language arts.  Language arts, Opie.  It's not English.  It's not English anymore?  It's language arts.  You're painting with your words.  Why is it called language arts?  I guess so.  I don't know.  They incorporate other things in it, study skills.  Let me tell you, because calling it English is fucking racist and not politically correct. 
[01:13:00]  Wait.  So, what has changed, though?  Why?  It's called language arts, but what is different from when we were growing up learning English in school?  Nothing, really.  Not that I can see.  Call it English!  I wish I could.  God, I'm starting to sound like my old man.  I got English.  This is what happens, I guess, huh?  Fourth period, I got English.  You know we're supposed to have an open mind.  Yeah.  This is the shit that drove us nuts when we were listening to our dad's talk. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  But this is ridiculous.  Why call it language arts?  It's English.  Language arts.  I have no idea.  Oh, my God.  Our kids are all going to grow up to be pussies.  As a parent, I don't know how I handle that one.  Look at that pepper spray.  What's math called?  Yeah, what is math called?  Math is still called math.  Oh.  Numbers getting together.  Yeah.  What about science?  Same thing.  Science, social studies, those are all the same. 
[01:14:00]  Social studies sounds like they should change that.  Are the Asians still good at math?  A lot of them are, yeah.  A lot of them.  That never changed, huh?  Oh, no.  They love the numbers.  Yeah.  By the way, I wish we had...  Why is that?  I don't know.  But you say that.  That's kind of racist, too, right?  Well, yeah.  It's not racist.  It's just one of those things.  Stereotyping?  It's one of those things they are.  The Asians love their numbers, though.  They see it all the time.  I mean, it's not, you know... 
[01:14:30]  Imagine being an Asian kid and you don't know numbers.  That can't be good.  What?  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  So I was just saying, if we see a lot of Asian kids doing well at math, I don't think it's racist.  They are...  Most of them are good at math.  Mm-hmm.  Every once in a while, you get a bad one.  A bad one?  Ah, this one's bad.  Throw them out.  How depressing.  I got the bad Asian in my class.  Sucks to math.  Making me look bad. 
[01:15:00]  Physics, by the way, is fucking turned upside down.  Oh, yeah.  What do you mean?  It's everything they thought, if the tests prove out, is wrong.  Fucking...  Oh.  They found neutrinos.  Speed of light.  Yeah.  And I knew this because I would run against neutrinos and I would beat them there, but not by as much as I beat light by.  They found neutrinos that have gone faster than the speed of light.  And it's...  The Einstein said it was impossible.  Nothing can go faster than the speed of light.  Doesn't that make you feel good that you didn't pay attention in physics class? 
[01:15:30]  I hated physics.  Physics.  And now I know, fuck, there was no reason to pay attention.  It just seems silly that with computers and all this stuff that we would have think, as genius as Einstein was, that some guy in the early 1900s with a pencil and a chalkboard figured out everything.  Yeah, yeah.  It just doesn't make sense.  But, let's look at the other side of that.  He figured out a lot of shit with a pencil and a fucking chalkboard.  A genius.  That's pretty amazing.  He's an amazing genius.  All these new guys have to use all the computers and stuff.  He's an amazing genius. 
[01:16:00]  He was just figuring shit out in his own mind.  Yeah.  He didn't have a computer ever in his lifetime, right?  No.  Even at the end of his life?  I don't believe so, no.  I don't think he was using one.  When did the computers hit, Ant?  Come on.  You sure?  The ENIAC.  Did he have the ENIAC?  He was not one that would really...  What was the ENIAC?  The size of a school?  Oh, it was giant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Computer's a relative term, anyway.  It's like, back then, there was probably something called a computer that he might have used.  But the amount of time he had to spend doing something, a computer, you could just enter it, 
[01:16:30]  and it's done in an eighth of a second.  He might spend a month doing.  A lifetime of fucking research that he went through would take, you know, maybe a couple of weeks.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, how you guys were talking about Asian kids and why they're so good at math?  It's two words.  Tiger mom.  Asian mothers are like drill sergeants at home.  I'm married to one.  And they bring out worksheets and flashcards from the time the kid is three all throughout school. 
[01:17:00]  They get drilled on simple arithmetic.  Why is that?  Why don't they drill a personality into their heads?  That doesn't help you make money when you get older.  But if you're good at math and you get good grades, then you'll make money.  And that's what it's all about.  Why did you marry an Asian?  Because she was kind of cute.  Everyone knows you fool around with Asians.  You don't marry Asians.  Oh, boy.  That's a lifetime of boredom.  That's a lifetime of boredom.  Oh, Opie, now. 
[01:17:30]  Come on.  Oh, come on now, Opie.  I've never dated an Asian chick in my life.  I'm not saying I wouldn't, but I just haven't.  I sat at the three-card table with this Asian lady that was winning like crazy.  Not even one fucking hint that she was winning like crazy.  No, don't get me started with playing table games with the Asians.  Yeah, you have the Asians who are born in China and then come over here.  And then they're the ones who were born here and grew up here.  And a lot more Americanized.  Those aren't too bad.  Yeah.  Your wife's not too bad? 
[01:18:00]  No, she's not.  She sounds like a girl from New Jersey.  All right, fair enough.  It's been my experience that their personalities are lacking a bit.  Not like an extra from M.A.S.H.?  I love those.  With their feet bound.  Hawkeye, we need the help in village.  I went on, by the way, a deleting out of my phone frenzy this week.  Oh, just a dead weight.  Dead weight.  Fuck, let me tell you women something.  Women over 25 fucking stink. 
[01:18:30]  You fucking wonder why you're single after a certain age?  What are they doing?  They're the worst.  Yeah?  The worst.  So you're just fucking deleting?  Bye.  Oh, fucking.  If you're one of those people that I have to text first and you don't, you never text  first, but you do engage me.  It's like, what did your fucking mom tell you that was the right way to do it?  You fucking idiot.  Yes.  That's right.  What do you mean engage?  Like a little, you know.  No, no, just hello. 
[01:19:00]  Engage in conversation.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, come up and actually, yeah, get the first text out there.  They wonder why we don't want to deal with them after a certain age.  That's why.  That's why.  Oh, man.  You just summed it up right there, Jimmy?  Yes.  All right.  Dead weight.  Dead fucking weight.  Oh, I deleted a bunch.  It felt wonderful.  Yeah, freeing.  Yes.  Good.  Good for you.  Fucking lumps.  Oh, boy.  And now, if you get a text from one of them, it'll just be a phone number, and you'll be  like, who's this?  Yeah.  I'll probably know. 
[01:19:30]  We're okay with the Asian talk, right?  It's just been my experience.  Yeah, whatever.  Kind of boring.  Michael in Manhattan, what's up?  Yeah.  Oh, but you have no idea what you're talking about.  That's why I took your call.  That's why I took your call.  Updated Asian is my whole life.  They're the most awesome individuals in the world.  They do anything you want.  In the world.  In the world.  See, hold on.  You said something there, sir.  Is it because a lot of guys that like Asian women, I always wonder if it's because they're  from typically submissive cultures.  And are you a dominant guy that likes submissive women? 
[01:20:00]  Well, to a point, but still, it's just the fact that I've got yellow fever, first of all.  But in my whole life, I've basically dated them.  And it's just like no argument with them.  You know, white bread chicks, you know, white girls, they're ridiculous.  They don't care about the money.  They don't care about anything.  They care about your happiness, taking care of you.  You know, and on the same token, I'm not using them as a slave or anything in that aspect.  But I'm just basically telling you, and I'm attracted to them, but it's their nature. 
[01:20:30]  But you see what you're saying, though?  You're not saying one thing about them being funny or them being interesting.  No, they are funny.  I'm just saying, the first qualities you're looking at is the submissive nature or them  taking care of you.  No, you're missing the point.  No, I'm not.  I'm just going by what you said, sir.  I'm not missing the point.  You said that.  Well, relax, Norton.  I'm relaxed, but you're telling me I'm missing the point, and I'm not.  Yeah, you are, because you're not listening.  You're basically just talking over it, okay? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay, then what do you like besides the fact that they care only about your happiness and  they don't argue?  Go ahead.  I told you already.  I'm attracted to them.  Right.  That's me personally.  You're asking me, why does everybody like an Asian?  I have no idea.  But you can't just say you just date them or you sleep with them and you don't marry  them.  I didn't say that.  No, no.  Opie did.  Was I talking to you, Norton?  Yes, you just were.  Stupid.  You just were.  Don't give me this stupid crap, pal.  Listen, you got the fucking job. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, sorry.  Let me bow and put your slippers under the bed like you like.  Go ahead.  Sorry, dominant male.  Go ahead, Alpha.  Not dominant male, you moron.  Ooh.  What's the matter?  You don't get enough arguing at home?  You have to argue now with me?  Norton.  Keep talking.  I am.  I'm talking about Asian girls, you moron.  I'm listening.  I know what you're talking about.  You keep saying moron.  Do you use that one around the office?  He's a moron.  You village idiot.  I don't live in the village.  Stupid.  I don't care. 
[01:22:00]  Moron.  All right.  Go ahead.  Finish with what you're talking about.  They don't argue.  Yeah.  Keep talking, though, Norton.  I am.  Get your shit out there, man.  Keep talking.  Yeah.  Get your shit out there, man.  Not the O&A and Norton show, pal.  Oh, real pal.  Yeah.  You want to find a partner that argues with you like this, that you'd know how to do  it, instead of just finding someone that listens to you and nods?  I was talking to Opie, not you, you dick.  You were just saying it.  You brought out...  You just said Norton.  ...to force your opinion into it.  I asked you a question.  You're not listening, and you're constantly talking. 
[01:22:30]  One long session.  I asked you a question.  I said, do you...  I asked you a fair question.  I wasn't talking to you.  I don't care.  I'm here.  I'm talking to Opie.  First of all, stop with that fucking awful inflection, and you are talking to Opie.  Inflection.  Now, sit there and deal with your crap.  Go ahead.  Talk to Opie.  Freaking annoying.  Shut up, Norton, you idiot.  Talk to Opie.  All right.  Go ahead, Opie.  Now you're going to double that.  Yeah, okay.  So, Opie, I like when I snap and they just show up. 
[01:23:00]  What does that mean?  I'm making fun of your inflection.  That's what it means.  You sound silly.  No, it's not a question you're sounding silly.  Yes, it is.  You're explaining myself.  I know, but it's the way you sound.  I'm talking to Opie.  You really basically heard that?  Yeah, we all...  That's why I'm being in the room is we're giggling at you.  We all heard it.  Giggling?  Yes, we're giggling.  We're not laughing loudly, but we're giggling.  Well, my point is, as far as Asians are concerned, if you shut the fuck up. 
[01:23:30]  No, I'm not your wife.  I'm not going to shut the fuck up.  That's what you're used to.  You said you like people that don't argue with you.  Idiot.  I have an office job where I'm emasculated, so I like to go home and not have to argue.  You have no idea about my life, you idiot.  I like to clap and get things done.  I'm talking to Opie.  Go ahead.  Talk to Opie.  I'll just listen.  Like I said, as far as the Asian girls are concerned, they're basically the best thing 
[01:24:00]  in the world.  That's my opinion.  Okay?  Okay.  Are you the racist Francesa, too?  What?  Are you racist Francesa?  No.  You sound like them a little bit.  No.  I told you guys back in the N.E.W. days.  All right.  Listen.  It's a long layoff, sir.  Where are we?  Well, I mean, you know, I basically have a life, and the way the economy is, you can't  pretty much call into a radio show. 
[01:24:30]  Let me ask you this.  Why have you been attracted to Asian women your whole life?  Is it your whole life, Michael?  Yeah.  I dated them in high school, and the mentality is the way they think and their thought process.  I mean, I'm attracted to them personally.  I think they're gorgeous.  But the way that they treat an individual is, or a guy for that matter, is cake.  Which Asian women are you attracted to, though?  Well, I've dated, you know.  Thailand's pretty, you know, the. 
[01:25:00]  Japanese, Chinese.  The Thai women are pretty hot.  Thai, Thai a little bit.  They're a little bit dirty.  Chinese are pretty hot.  Oh, yeah.  Koreans are a little rough.  Yeah.  Koreans are the hillbillies of the Orient.  And Japanese are all right.  Oh, Japanese are phenomenal.  I've just never been attracted.  It's not that I don't think they're, like, I would never date an Asian chick.  I just never have.  I don't know why.  I've never met.  Have you?  Jimmy, do you ever date any?  Do you ever go out with them?  Nah.  I mean, even sexually, because, again, the thing where they're kind of, 
[01:25:30]  submissive, which I'm not saying it's a bad quality, but I just, I haven't had that many  experiences.  There's a couple I've liked and just haven't, nothing's happened.  I like when there's a mixture.  I fell hard for half Korean, half Korean, even though I said Koreans, not the better ones,  but half Korean, half Dutch in college.  I fell hard.  But in general, like a pure Asian, I have always found them pretty damn boring.  I mean...  But that's just my experience. 
[01:26:00]  Are you talking about ABC, American-born Chinese?  I mean, or...  Oh, yeah.  I don't speak that language.  How else am I going to communicate?  It's got letters for these things.  Yeah.  Although there was a girl, yeah, some of the Vietnamese girls growing up weren't bad.  Yeah?  They weren't bad, either.  They're filthy, though.  Like the ones running down the street naked after the naked bomb.  I don't know.  I mean, it's just been my experience.  I don't know.  I pretty much have been hands-off.  Do you like hardcore Asian porn?  Is that the only porn you like?  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  This guy is so into Asians.  It's about...  I get a yellow fever like you would not believe that.  Mrs. Livingston from fucking Courtship of Eddie's Father.  Jesus.  Just waiting on her.  Hand and foot waiting on her.  That's a really old reference.  I was like 14 and I met...  I was like 14 and I met this Korean girl and she was so smoking hot, man.  She did anything and everything.  And that was it.  I mean...  Have you ever dated outside the Asian woman thing?  Yeah.  I've gone...  Yeah.  I've gone white. 
[01:27:00]  I mean, I've done the Wonder Bread and I basically went chocolate, too.  I mean, I have no problem with that.  Jesus.  He's all over the place.  It's all pink inside.  Come on.  And...  I don't care if it's all pink inside.  I like what the wrapper is.  Better be lily white.  Why, Anthony, why do you just subject yourself just to white girls?  Because that's what I find attractive.  And they don't repulse me.  What do you mean?  Like certain other races.  Oh.  All right.  So some girl's naked on your bed. 
[01:27:30]  She's smoking hot.  Okay.  She's not white.  You're not going to jump on it.  You're right.  I'm not.  You're going to say no.  Yeah.  That's your mentality.  Based on certain races and ethnic backgrounds, yes, I would say no.  That's pretty honest about that.  Let me go to Jeff.  Jeff's on with Michael.  Jeff's in Michigan.  He's married to an Asian woman for 10 years.  And this guy's completely wrong.  Jeff, it's to you, sir.  Thanks, Sam.  How you doing, boys?  Thanks.  Hey.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  I don't know why that guy, I don't know why he talks like that.  Because Asian women, German women, American women, they're all the same.  That bullshit about being submissive and all that shit, when they're Americanized, they're Americanized.  And they will fuck you over just as quick as anybody else would.  I didn't say they were submissive, but I'm right here.  It's not that guy, pal.  Jesus.  The only difference between an Asian and the rest of them is they're pussy slanted. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, wow, that's funny.  Hey, listen.  That's real intelligent, you simpleton.  Some basic friggin' the slant.  You're an idiot, okay?  You're a white, red hillbilly from the Midwest.  You have no idea, okay?  And you probably eat goddamn vanilla ice cream your whole life.  Hey, why is it that when he says that he only dates white women, you have a problem with that?  That's his opinion, you moron.  Yeah, but you're the one that said you like fucking Asian women, and when somebody started, like Jimmy, started talking to you about it, you got all pissy. 
[01:29:00]  You're an idiot, man.  No, you...  Oh, I'm an idiot.  Yeah, good comeback, all right?  Did you write that down before you told me, you moron?  All right, I got better things to do than listening to you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So get back into your friggin' truck and drive away, you hillbilly.  You have no idea, okay?  All right, your idea of a good Italian meal is ragu and a fistful of velva, Vita. 
[01:29:30]  Vela, Vita.  You kind of messed that one up, Mike.  You tripped on that one.  You might have slipped on that one.  I'm only human.  What could I tell you?  It's early in the morning.  I got this stupid hillbilly moron telling me, you're an idiot, okay?  I kind of like this guy.  Yeah, I kind of like this guy.  He's turned me.  What part is what he's saying?  You don't know when you get Americanized.  Well, you know, that's your problem.  You are, you're such, oh, my God.  I don't know.  Get it out.  Have a big conversation with them, guys. 
[01:30:00]  But you're an idiot, man.  I got to go.  See you later, boys.  Bye, mister.  All right, there goes Jeff.  All right, Michael.  I think we got things done here.  All right, boys.  We got things done.  All right.  Michael Manhattan.  Thank you so much.  And now, unfortunately, my name has become O-Pay.  O-Pay.  They're all saying O-Pay.  O-Pay.  That guy was a little angry, a little defensive.  Yeah.  Especially since I wasn't throwing Asian chicks under the bus at all. 
[01:30:30]  I was just curious.  He was under the rickshaw.  You throw him under the rickshaw.  Whatever.  He was the one that brought up the fact that the Asians are subservient kind of thing.  And then when you pointed it out, how he liked that, he got all defensive about it.  But it wasn't even attacking him.  No.  It was noticing something because if culturally Asian women are more submissive typically,  and those are the first things you mention is how they take care of you. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  Oh, okay.  Maybe that's what you like about them.  No.  Like, that was the first things he said.  Yeah, no.  He got all mad.  He's just pent.  He's pent up anger.  Well, this is going to get everyone on the same page.  We got a great joke coming in from Jim in South Dakota.  Jim, go ahead.  Yeah, I just wanted y'all to know that the reason why your crack runs horizontal, I mean, vertical instead of horizontal. 
[01:31:30]  Because if you slide down a sliding board naked, it'd go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Dude, your phone crapped out.  Well, I got a lot here.  Let me get back up off the floor.  Your phone crapped out.  Did it really?  Yeah.  First of all, who's screening the calls?  Because they're going to get a beating in a second.  Who's screening the calls?  Raise your hand.  That's Paul.  Huh?  Oh, Paul.  Geez, he screens calls like his mom bakes.  Oh, no.  And now back to you.  Didn't hear the joke, Jimmy?  No, because you crapped out.  It was supposed to be a joke, but it crapped out, brother. 
[01:32:00]  Okay, well, I'll try again.  All right.  Okay, this is because the guy said that already knows.  Jim, you there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hi, brother.  I hear the paper rattling.  I don't have paper in my hand.  What are you talking about?  Okay.  Okay.  Anyway.  Sorry about that.  Go ahead.  Your crack runs vertical instead of horizontal.  Wait, which way is vertical?  Vertical is up and down, I guess?  Horizontal is horizon. 
[01:32:30]  Exactly.  Horizon, horizontal.  Okay.  All right.  I got it.  Start over.  Okay.  I didn't know the difference between vertical and horizontal myself, so I'm sorry about that.  Go ahead.  If you're standing up, your crack runs vertical and not horizontal.  Yeah.  So it's up and down.  Just say up and down, I think, because I'm a little confused.  Up and down.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  Let's hear this joke.  Okay.  Okay.  Your crack runs up and down instead of sideways?  Yeah.  Because if you slid down a sliding board naked, it'd go blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 
[01:33:00]  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Is it us or is it his phone?  I think it's...  I don't know if it's your phone or not because we haven't had problems with any of the calls  today.  I'm hearing like a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Is that your phone?  You crap out right after you say if it was something about a sliding pod and then you  crap out.  And all we hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  That's southern for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean?  What is a sliding board?  What happened?  Anyway.  What's a sliding board?  We're really confused by your joke.  Yeah, I don't get it. 
[01:33:30]  Like a banister?  Is that like a sliding board or...?  Yeah, that could be.  Yeah, you could use that.  What other type of sliding boards are there?  Well, when you grew up in the 60s like I did, they had big metal tall ladders, and then  they had an escape route from the top that you slid down, and it was called a slide because  you slid down it.  So we're just talking about a typical playground slide? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Can you imagine doing that?  So now what?  So now what happens?  Well, if you did that...  As what?  An American?  No.  Jimmy...  I have no idea what he's talking about.  Well, now we understand that it's a slide.  Yeah, it's a slide, but if the vagina was crooked, how would that prevent you from sliding on a  slide?  Right.  Well, it wouldn't be going up and down. 
[01:34:30]  But here's the problem, sir.  When we all grew up, we didn't slide down anything naked.  And why would you slide differently down a slide if you're Asian?  Like, I don't understand why you wouldn't go down straight.  If you had a horizontal twat, you still would have clothes on, so that noise would never happen.  I'm very confused by your joke.  Look, I'm just confused.  Yeah.  What state are you from?  What state am I from?  I don't know. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm from Mississippi.  Ah, okay.  Now it makes sense.  Now it all makes sense.  Do you understand?  Yeah, that's south of the Mason-Dixon line?  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  I-S-S-I-S-I-P-P-I.  Yeah.  I go home to family reunions just to see my old girlfriends.  What happened?  Oh.  Why are they there?  Yeah.  How do you hang out with chicks once you've broken up?  I never would allow a chick to come to my family reunion.  There's no reason.  For what?  Yeah.  Like, why would you talk to them after that? 
[01:35:30]  Like, if I'm done, I'm done.  Uh, I hate to do this to you, Jim, but one, two, three, four, five people want you to tell  the joke again because they, they, now that they understand the slide thing, and we'll  accept the fact that you're now naked sliding down the slide.  That's fair enough for everybody, right?  Yes.  All right.  So five, five, well, even more people want to, want you to retell the joke.  So let's all imagine a slide and someone naked.  Now I think this is going to make sense.  All right, Jim, go ahead.  Okay.  If you're, if you're crack. 
[01:36:00]  Ran sideways, that's against the, the way the slide is pointed.  It'd go, when you slid down it.  Yeah.  Okay.  If you're, if you're.  But it, it's just dead air. 
[01:36:30]  It's great.  You just ruined our show.  Yeah.  Yes.  I, I apologize for that.  Just, just go.  Just go.  It'd be better this way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just bail out.  Just hang up or crash into something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your choice.  Okay.  I liked it. 
[01:37:00]  Great joke.  I don't know.  Chip.  It wasn't a bad joke.  Chip liked it.  Yeah.  It was, you're supposed to say, if you go down a sliding pond the other way, you're going  to, you're going to go like, uh, all right, Jim.  Thank you.  Okay.  No problem.  The second part of this, uh, on the phone, it said decent Asian joke.  Oh, really?  That's why I want to know who was answering the phone.  It was Paul.  Wow.  Paul thought that's was a decent Asian joke. 
[01:37:30]  He heard a, Oh, not bad.  Actually, not bad.  Let me put this through.  Paul can kiss my fanny.  Paul liked it.  He's saying, no, it, uh, he knew it was bad.  That's why he put that in the comment there.  That's why I called it decent.  Oh, I see what Paul said.  Maybe he misspelled dissent because you were going down that spot.  Hey, he's lying.  Why don't we take a break and go home?  No, he can't go home.  What?  It's, it's 7.57. 
[01:38:00]  I got to get ready for Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Thanksgiving is on Thursday.  And I got to find one of those Christmas trees that snows.  You could do that later.  You got to show.  The store was sold out.  Christmas tree that snows.  I don't even know.  Christmas trees that snow is the new thing.  What is it?  How does that work?  It was flying out the top.  And what is it?  It's snow.  Well, it's not snow.  It's like movie snow.  What is it made of?  Some toxic material?  I don't know.  It's movie snow.  Asbestos.  Yeah.  You haven't seen these yet.  It's a mesothelioma tree.  I was going to get mine yesterday and they're sold out. 
[01:38:30]  Stupid lady only bought 10.  What is it?  A snowing, snowing Christmas tree.  Yeah.  Who wants that shit all over the house?  Yeah.  Well, it, it, it gathers in a thing down below.  How can it gather in a thing?  It gathers in that thing and then it shoots it up the top again.  How big is it?  And then your tree is snowing the entire time.  Why is it horrible?  It's awful.  Why would you have a bucket of snow under your tree?  A bucket of fucking white stuff there.  I'll put something around it so it doesn't look like a bucket of snow.  Your tree is dandruff. 
[01:39:00]  And then I'm going to fucking light it properly and it's going to look awesome.  How does it get up there?  It's like a thing.  What does it got?  Like an auger feed?  Like that?  Yeah.  You see how it's going down into that thing and then it goes to the bottom of the base  and then shoots back up the stem, which is hollow.  Is it paper?  How annoying.  Is it?  Why is it annoying?  Is it confetti?  The tree's just leaking garbage everywhere.  That would go everywhere.  It's not just going to get caught in that thing and the bottom.  Well, make sure you have a large skirt on the floor to collect the extra movie stuff. 
[01:39:30]  And you would want your kid taking fistfuls of this stuff and putting it in his mouth.  Just eating it.  We'll have it fenced off.  Oh, fenced off.  That's a fun Christmas tree.  Fenced off.  Fenced off.  Barbed wire.  It'd be a nice little display for everyone.  But you had a Rottweiler to guard it.  Right.  Nobody's going to think it's legitimate snow.  I mean, it's inside.  You guys are missing the fucking Christmas spirit.  Your tree has eczema.  You don't want a Christmas tree that snows?  What's wrong with you people?  No. 
[01:40:00]  No.  Like a Christmas tree?  No.  Why?  I wouldn't want a tree that's shot cum.  Show the video.  Why don't you show a still picture?  Yeah, what is it?  A still picture.  What's the still picture?  Come on, Sam.  I'm sorry.  I was just befuddled.  Where can I find one of these things?  My store is sold out.  Let's see.  Snowing Christmas tree.  I'm ready to see this.  Have an open mind.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's the worst.  That's great.  You're sprinkling your lawn?  That's horrendous.  It looks like a sprinkler.  But it's snow.  It's terrible.  And look, your tree is snowing.  What is that stuff? 
[01:40:30]  Or it's snowing on the tree.  The angle they show you is perfect, so it looks like it's outdoors.  Look how nice that is.  They don't show you the living room where it's fucking, it's all over the floor and in  the rug.  What?  And it's fucking, it spits it like in big clumps.  Who cares?  Morella will clean it up, Jimmy.  That's true.  She is terrific.  She is good at cleaning our fucking apartment.  Look at that.  Your trees, they're snowing.  It's snowing.  There's something slightly white trashy about this.  Slightly?  This is so white trash.  Look how cool it is. 
[01:41:00]  I'm astounded.  Why?  Look how much snow are on those fucking individual branches.  You need a tub with meth in it next to it.  Look, and then you could do a whole let it snow thing where like now you got other like  Christmas characters and it's snowing on them too.  Oh.  This isn't even somewhat cool.  No.  Why?  So it's trying too hard.  It's not cool at all.  Yeah.  It's inside.  Why would it snow?  Well, the problem is that the tree is a self-snowing feature.  And it only comes out of the top of the tree.  Like, I think it should be coming from the ceiling somehow. 
[01:41:30]  If you're going to, you might as well go all in.  It's like a mechanism from the ceiling.  Yeah, look.  It's like a sprinkler of snow.  It really is.  Is that styrofoam?  I don't know.  It's movie snow, I call it.  That's awful.  PVC or something.  Look how cool that looks.  It looks like it's snowing in your house.  With a big upside down umbrella underneath your tree to catch this fucking...  What?  You have to collect the snow so it keeps snowing.  Where do you put the presents?  There's fake snow everywhere.  Under the fake snow part.  And what is on the sides?  You put the presents under where the...  Under the umbrella. 
[01:42:00]  Under the umbrella part.  So the snow doesn't even hit the ground?  No.  It goes into the upside umbrella so it can continue to snow.  It's styrofoam BBs, it looks like.  Why are you guys getting mad?  This is cool.  I hope it's flammable.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  That is awful.  It's not awful.  Makes me want to convert to Judaism.  Yeah.  That is terrible.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  I know where they sell them, but I certainly wouldn't buy it.  Please tell me where they sell them.  The Pocono Brewing Company. 
[01:42:30]  And you can buy them.  Next Friday, Saturday, the 25th and 26th, I'll be performing there.  You're going to some different places, I'm noticing.  Because I'm working on...  I'm shooting a special in March, so I'm doing...  I'm just putting the hour together.  And it feels pretty ready, but...  Yeah.  Go to brownpapertickets.com.  And then Thursday through Saturday, December 1, 2, 3, I return to Maryland, Baltimore, at  McGooby's Joke House.  Supposed to be a great room with a horrible name for a club.  McGooby's.  Yes.  All right.  With that said, we'll take a break. 
[01:43:00]  I've got to find my Christmas tree that snows.  That is awful.  It's terrible.  Why wouldn't you do this?  They are.  They're little styrofoam pellets.  Styrofoam pellets.  Yeah.  Nice, right?  It's hard.  Yeah.  I mean, the dogs would just eat them.  Oh, yeah.  The dog's eating it.  The cat is shitting in the umbrella full of it.  Styrofoam shit.  And the cat's using it like kitty litter.  I don't have a cat.  And then at the top of the tree, there's just cat shit spurting out.  I don't have a cat, so I don't have to worry about that shit.  Your 18-month-old kid would just get handfuls and throw it all over the house.  And I would if I came over.  I'm 43. 
[01:43:30]  Yes.  How do you resist?  I'd kick it.  See?  See how festive that is?  Jimmy throwing the movie snow around my apartment.  Movie snow.  Morella fucking sweeping it up constantly.  I would pick it up with my hands, and I would just start going, here comes Santa Claus!  Here comes Santa Claus!  Throwing it all about.  Throwing it all over.  You know what?  I'm going to make my own.  Fuck it.  I'm going to make my own.  I'm going to have it come out of the ceiling so it looks like it's really snowing.  How would you do that? 
[01:44:00]  Huh?  How would you make it come out of the ceiling?  Plus, that's going to be...  Not officially out of the ceiling, but it'll be a little pipe that you won't see.  And then it's like maybe under a chandelier or something.  And then it's snowing above the tree coming down.  So you're going to be doing some major construction.  Out of the top of the tree.  It's going to be totally impractical once December's over for you to be in your house.  Yeah, but it'll be a cool December.  How cool will my December be?  All right.  I'm going to give you that.  All right.  Can I thank somebody?  Oh, yes.  Thank you to Mike Shanley on Twitter.  He says, he goes to family reunion to see his ex-girlfriends because he's an inbred redneck. 
[01:44:30]  He didn't invite them.  It was a joke.  Oh, no.  Hey, thanks, Mike Shanley.  I didn't realize that.  I think we're...  Oh, my God.  This is a weird week to do radio.  I think anyone with real jobs took the week off and they're sleeping in.  And these are the guys that are left.  Yeah.  We're talking to a lot of stupid people.  I did not explain that to you.  There's been a lot of that, though, man.  The instant feedback seems a little strange today. 
[01:45:00]  The Twitter is a little strange.  Only stupid people are awake right now?  I would...  Yeah.  Mostly.  No, you have to put a percentage on it.  Then some people go see they weren't talking about me.  So I would say 80% of the people listening right now are stupid.  Wow.  So 20% aren't.  80% stupid at any rate.  So you might be one of the 20% that aren't.  But you're probably in the 80.  Well, they don't want to think that.  Statistically, though.  They don't want to think that.  So they'll just throw themselves in the 20% category.  Odds are you're in the 80.  You never want to say 100% because that fucks you over bad.  Right.  But if you think you're in the 20%, you're stupid. 
[01:45:30]  So you're in the 80.  Yeah.  No.  I just like to think that 80% are really stupid and there's a 20% out there.  Is that Occupy Cairo, Ant?  Yeah.  They've beaten the shit out of that guy.  You think that shit would ever come to America?  Not the way they are with cameras and shit, I guess.  Yeah, but they have cameras in Egypt.  Yeah, they don't care, though.  Accountability is a little different here.  There's no repercussions over there.  All right.  Jimmy's got gigs.  He promoted that.  And we'll take a break, I guess. 
[01:46:00]  Breakie-wakey.  Figure out some shit.  What do you want to talk about next?  I don't know.  I think more fantastic calls.  They've been good so far, huh?  From the wonderful listeners.  They've been terrific.  Oh, yeah.  Dead waste.  Amazing.  Out of the phone.  Oh.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Who the fuck?  Go ahead. 
[01:46:30]  Date whoever it is you want to date.  What do you want me to tell you?  And it's like when you're nice.  This is the thing.  There are people I was actually nice to and not being a pig with.  Yeah.  That's what's mind-boggling.  Oh, and you're an asshole?  No, no, but meaning like they're not even people I was sending dick pictures to or any  of that stuff.  Right.  Jesus.  That's why when you meet somebody, just be a complete fucking creep.  Yeah.  Be a creep.  Don't be nice to them.  That's my strategy.  I got to take a break. 
[01:47:00]  Snowing Christmas tree.  How many people are buying them now because of me?  No.  Far less.  Do I get a percentage of the sales?  Good luck.  Can I?  80%.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think there's some out-of-work construction guys that could set up my room to snow from  the ceiling?  I'm sure they can.  Because now I want to go all in.  I'll take their fake movie snow, but I want to distribute it differently than how they got  it set up.  There's a giant umbrella in the room?  Yeah.  Why not?  Maybe a fan to blow the snow toward the tree, make it look more like a nor'easter snowstorm. 
[01:47:30]  It's bad luck to have an umbrella open in the house.  It's not an umbrella.  It just looks like an umbrella.  It's an upside-down umbrella with a tree in it.  Some bitches couldn't open an umbrella.  How else are you supposed to collect the fake snow so it pops back up through the tree  to snow?  You're not.  A garbage can.  Yeah.  It's just an awful white trash Christmas-y thing.  You don't like it?  No.  It shouldn't exist.  Why?  It's horrible.  What's wrong with it? 
[01:48:00]  And it's humiliating that people bought it.  Why?  I feel bad for them that they have it in their house and they didn't realize the idiots.  No, they love it.  They're telling their friends.  They're like, check this out.  He flips the switch.  Look and it snows.  No way.  That's great.  It's a piece of shit umbrella tree.  That fucking tree is terrible.  Wow, you guys.  Ant gets to do fun stuff for Christmas.  Why can't I do fun stuff?  What did I do?  You can, but that's not fun.  You put all the lights on your house and stuff.  Decorate my house up.  I can't do that because I live in an apartment. 
[01:48:30]  So it's easy for the delivery people to find my house.  I go, it's the one with the Christmas lights on it.  Look, the fantastic, fascinating, amazing, snowing Christmas tree.  It says it right there, Ant.  What's it going to say?  The shitty, white, trashy.  Yes.  Low class.  Low class.  If it's in your house, kill yourself.  Wait, this one is the 15-inch snowblowing fiber optic Christmas tree.  15-inch?  How tall are these dumb trees?  Oh, it's tiny? 
[01:49:00]  15 inches.  It's a foot and a half.  Foot in chains.  Yeah, foot in the third.  Well, this one looks like it's in a little, like, bottle.  Look at this one.  It's a snow globe.  All right, it's a snow globe.  That's fine.  You get a snow globe.  You shake it up.  Oh, what a nice midi fucking rendition of 12 Days of Christmas.  All right, I don't like that one.  12 Days of Christmas sucks.  I'll figure it out as we go to break, I guess, right?  Mm-hmm.  Feeling pretty good. 
[01:49:30]  Snowing in the house.  Fa-la-la-la.  You know that starts next week.  I know.  I know.  Are you ready for it?  No.  I'm never ready for it.  You're ready for it this year.  Hate it.  This is the year we turn you, and to get into that song.  I am not being turned.  No, this is the year, I think.  Good luck.  I think this is the year we turn you.  Very, very good.  Fa-la-la.  Fa-la-la-la.  Making my way in the fa-la-la-la.  Shit.  Standing in the leaves in the river. 
[01:50:00]  Fa-la-la-la.  What's that?  Somebody made it.  It is an umbrella.  That's an umbrella.  With a pole.  A pole, and it's barely shooting one or two grains.  Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about.  That's the redneck version, where someone tried to make their own.  Yeah.  There's only a redneck version.  Mine is going to be store-bought.  Only a redneck version.  Huh?  Look how dumb that looks.  This is also the redneck version.  By the way, putting it back in the box, you're going to have to get all those fucking balls.  You have to shake the leaves.  They're going to go all over the fucking floor.  Oh, you'll be stepping on them.  Yeah, you'll be finding those the whole year. 
[01:50:30]  This guy's got carrots on his tree.  Peppers.  They're not peppers.  Bell peppers.  Tree blows.  Well, then why is the store sold out if it sucks so bad?  They probably threw them out, because everybody ridiculed them.  We should have went to break minutes ago.  I don't know why Iraq won't hit a fucking button.  Wait, he's waiting for you to get the signal, right, Iraq?  Iraq?  I think there were a few signals in there.  Oh, my God.  This is actually a house that has it in there.  Look at it in the corner.  It just looks so fucking humiliating. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  That looks dumb.  It looks cool as shit.  You've got to light it better, though.  It looks like shit.  Yeah, with a flame thrower.  I'll agree they're lighting us in there.  You've got to light it.  The family has horrible presents for the kids, too.  That's terrible.  Snowing Christmas tree.  Bullshit.  Holy shit.  We've got a good fucking joke coming in before break.  Paul, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Paul.  How are you, buddy?  Where are you calling from? 
[01:51:30]  What's going on today?  Are you working?  Yeah, on my way.  What kind of job do you have?  Sales.  And where are you selling today?  Electrical supplies.  All right.  What city or state?  New York City.  All right.  What do you got for the show?  You got any 20-amp breakers?  Nice.  Yeah, yeah, man.  I need some of those.  Looks like the tree is taking a shower.  That tree is so cool, but it's not only the visual.  It has audio, too. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  Boing?  No, because the branches are vertical.  When the snow comes down, it goes boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh.  Sorry.  I didn't know you were joking.  That's all.  Sorry, brother.  I love the callback.  Paul, but a good callback.  Opie, I've got to ask you a question.  Oh, what do I do now?  What are you going to do?  When you trail your ass, are you trying to be like Ron Bennington?  Not on purpose.  Maybe I picked that up from him. 
[01:52:30]  Why do we trail his asses?  I never noticed that.  We all do that sometimes.  We do it as a joke for Ron.  It's a tribute.  Yeah, I think it's more of just like a tribute, to be honest with you.  Oh, okay.  I never noticed that.  And Ant's right.  We all do it.  Well, me and Ant do it, certainly.  I never do it.  I cut my asses off half.  I don't even go the whole full swirl.  I cut an ass, yeah.  Hey, don't set me.  We just do little things on the show.  Okay.  So maybe we're biting off Ronnie.  I think it's more of a...  Oh, it's an homage.  Homage.  I believe so, yeah. 
[01:53:00]  There's your answer, Paul.  Yes.  The fact that Opie has a cigar in his mouth, I'm concerned about.  You buddinski.  All right, Paul.  Stop trying to make trouble.  Yeah.  I'm getting that deal.  All right.  All right, Paul.  Go away.  We're going to take more of your questions after the break.  Yes.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest  we couldn't get. 
[01:53:30]  Big time music star, pop and country music sensation, Taylor Swift.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Taylor Swift.  Taylor, do you like grapes?  Absolutely.  Thank you so much for your time.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts and one question with a guest we couldn't get on  the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[01:54:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, Anthony.  I just taught Sam a thing or two about working.  About a thing or two.  I don't think Sam has ever had to really work in his life.  Mother gives him everything.  And trust me, we're not working.  This radio show, this is not a job.  We get that.  But with that said, Sam is trying to tell everyone it's a Monday.  It's not Monday.  No.  Today is Thursday.  It's Thursday.  Tomorrow is Friday. 
[01:54:30]  And then we got one, two, three, what, four Saturdays in a row?  Wednesday, Thursdays.  And then we get four Saturdays, then finally a Sunday, and then a week from today will be  the first Monday in a while.  First Monday in two weeks.  But in your stupid world, today's Monday and tomorrow's Tuesday.  That's dumb.  And the reason I say all this, by the way, is because we're only working today, which  is Thursday, and tomorrow, which is Friday.  And then that's it for a while.  People are going to think this is a taped show now.  It's not a taped show.  Working Joes understand this logic. 
[01:55:00]  You never come into work on a Monday knowing you have a short week and go, it's Monday.  No one does that.  No, because then you feel like shit because Monday's still Monday, and it sucks.  Today's Thursday.  Yeah, but then you get to think to yourself, I get Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday as free  days.  No, that's someone that's never worked for a living.  Today's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Friday.  Then we go Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Sunday, then Monday.  But Saturday means tomorrow's Sunday, and then you got to go back to work.  No.  A lot of Saturdays in a row.  You can have a lot of Saturdays in a row.  I like the idea of Wednesday, Thursday, Friday are free days. 
[01:55:30]  It's like, wow, these are extra days.  That's stupid.  Because I don't usually get these days to myself.  I'll tell you why that's stupid.  Because then you act like it's a Wednesday when it's actually a Saturday.  No, I don't.  So you don't do anything with that day off.  You'd go, oh, it's Wednesday, so why would I do anything?  But if you know it as a Saturday, then you're going to enjoy yourself.  But don't you feel like you're getting something for free on a Wednesday when you don't have  to get up the next morning?  Exactly.  I love being out on a Wednesday night and going, oh, I can go to Balthazar and not have to worry.  And it's Wednesday, and you keep telling yourself that.  But that means it's Saturday. 
[01:56:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  And you can't go Friday because we have to work Fridays.  You get to stay up late on a day that you don't usually.  No.  And it's a treat.  And you tell people at the restaurant when you're eating, you're like, I'm Wednesday-ing it up.  Right.  And help me out here.  You got to go.  Is today Monday or Thursday?  No, it's Thursday.  Thank you.  See, he didn't even have to think about it.  Because if you think of it as Monday, Mondays suck.  Right.  Like, even last night.  Sunday.  Hold on.  Okay, okay.  Even Sunday.  Well, yesterday was Wednesday.  Well, no, no.  All right.  Fair enough.  I won't go there.  All right.  Fair enough.  Sunday was last night. 
[01:56:30]  Sundays normally suck ass, and I sit there going, like, fuck, it's Sunday.  Right.  It wasn't even that bad.  Because we knew today would be Thursday.  Right.  Yeah, but it's fun when you wake up and you go, oh, shit, it's Monday.  And then you go, but after Tuesday, I get three days to Wednesday.  No one has fun on a Wednesday.  If you don't have work.  Today's Thursday.  Tomorrow's Friday.  And then we get a bunch of Saturdays in a row.  Ant just made Sam's point, though, without meaning to.  I did.  Yes, because you said that Sunday didn't seem that bad because Monday was coming. 
[01:57:00]  But Wednesday's never seemed that bad because Thursday's coming.  So Sunday seemed like Wednesday.  Yeah, so Sunday's seeming cool.  Like, even Monday's not that bad when you know you got the week off.  So not only do you have the extra days and you're getting something, but Monday doesn't look bad.  But, see, the problem is we had a look at a Sunday yesterday.  Saturdays are not a fun, exciting thing because they happen every week.  You always get a Saturday off.  Saturdays are always fun.  No, they're not.  They happen once a week.  It's not that typical.  What day is today?  Today's Monday. 
[01:57:30]  No!  I just taught you.  Because a Wednesday and a Thursday and a Friday that you don't have to work, this is a fun, exciting thing.  What a treat.  You've never worked.  What a treat.  What a treat.  What a treat that is.  What was the hardest job you've ever had?  Well, I worked a bunch of shitty retail jobs before I did.  But, I mean, you know I was here right now in college.  Did you ever have to wash dishes where the boss was half-retard?  No, that's very specific.  I did not have-  And he was allowed to boss you around?  No.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh.  I have no idea. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  Well, I mean-  There used to be a restaurant at the Walt Whitman Mall.  His biggest job was pleasing mother.  Mother.  I worked at a movie theater.  So, a mother's world, every day has to be that day.  I worked at a-  You don't know how to trick yourself into making the days go by.  Why would you trick yourself into making the days go by?  Because there's guys that work real jobs, and that's what you do.  Yeah, but I don't-  Look, everyone knows out there.  Look, they're all in agreement.  But you just said 80% of them are stupid.  But see, the problem is for some of the guys out there, today's Wednesday.  Because they're in a home- 
[01:58:30]  Oh, because they got to do the-  No, and they're saying this, and it's a feedback.  They get it.  You don't say today's Monday.  That's stupid.  I don't want all the Saturdays.  I want special days that I don't usually get.  Damn.  Then go enjoy them with mother.  Well, I'll see her probably.  Definitely on Thursday.  Mother!  Thanksgiving.  Oh, she's going to cook?  She's going to do all the cooking?  Thanksgiving is on Saturday this year.  What is it?  The turkey?  Oh, yeah.  Turkey.  The potatoes.  Potatoes?  What is a potato?  It's a set-on-purpose.  Potatoes, yeah.  I was supposed to-  Do you have sweet potatoes? 
[01:59:00]  I don't.  I don't know if she makes them or not.  Every potato.  Sweet potatoes suck a dick.  Dude, no, I started-  Enough of the sweet potatoes when you can have a regular potato.  I agree, but I started to like sweet potato pie, and I know that black people love sweet  potatoes, and I've been hearing it from my black friends for years.  Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes.  Even when I ask them about something else.  Oh, sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes.  So I don't hang out with Sweet Potatoes Jones anymore.  When you get like an egg dish, and they throw the potatoes in there that they kind of  cook up a little bit, and they sneak some sweet potatoes in there, get the fuck  out of here.  They're not bad.  They're all sweet.  I had them some recently.  They were fucking good. 
[01:59:30]  Why wouldn't you have a regular potato?  I love regular potatoes.  Maybe like a little red one with the red skin and my favorites.  Sweet potatoes like a treat.  A little sugar on there.  Oh, come on.  A little sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes.  Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes.  No matter what you're talking about, they say sweet potatoes, black people.  I don't know why.  Sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes.  They look like regular potatoes, but they don't taste like a regular potato.  They're sweet.  They're sweet.  Fuck that shit.  Put a little sugar on them, whip them up.  No.  I don't want to make cornbread from scratch, but not sweet cornbread. 
[02:00:00]  Like real cornbread from the South.  Not like, you know, Boston Market.  Right.  It's not like that.  It's sugary cornbread.  I just know cornbread.  Real cornbread.  There may be treats tomorrow.  I've advised her not to, but there may be treats.  Oh, shut my mouth because I want treats.  I say this.  We don't need her treats.  Oh, yeah?  What kind of treats is she thinking?  She asked me.  I told her, you're the artist here.  I'm not going to tell you how to do your job. 
[02:00:30]  But she doesn't like stuff that's not freshly baked.  Right.  I mean, that's going to be taken into her.  Is she okay with that?  Well, she's going to make things specifically that will last overnight.  Can't we microwave her cookies for like five, ten seconds to warm them back up and make  them mushy?  No, you can't put those.  Anything that she does, she doesn't want it in the microwave.  Can the bitch make a little cheese bread?  Not anymore.  Can the bitch make any cheese bread?  Tell that bitch I want some pumpkin pie.  Tell that bitch to hurry up. 
[02:01:00]  I'll pinch her in the ass.  She's excited that she's hosting the Thanksgiving show.  She's hosting it?  Yeah.  I think my dad's coming in to do it, too, because he wants to be a part of it.  Oh, that's awesome.  Will you be here?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I'll coach him through it.  Oh, that's awesome.  That'll be fun to listen to.  Please play bits that are going to be really humiliating for them to introduce.  Well, I'm hosting.  We're doing all mother bits.  Oh, okay.  Ah.  You know, it's the.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He has a few bad ones, and I just saw Travis. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Travis is a feature.  A little uncomfortable there.  I've been telling E-Rock to dig through all the bits.  Well, can E-Rock give us a list of the mother bits that he definitely knows will be played?  Yeah.  Axe and Potty.  Well, he's right.  Oh, my God.  And that fucking guy has to shit during our show every fucking day.  He shits a lot.  So much.  That motherfucker is constantly shitting during our show.  He's marching down the hall.  He's like, I'm not shitting.  Look at him.  But even how he walks, you can tell there's a lot of way to pull out. 
[02:02:00]  Look at him.  He's heavy trudging.  He really is trudging.  He trudges.  He doesn't walk.  He trudges.  Look at his shit.  He's all freaking out.  Everything's heavy and loud.  E-Rock.  E-Rock, were you shitting?  No, I was in the office.  What?  Well, somebody threw you under the bus.  You shit a lot during the show.  Someone said you were shitting.  No.  You do shit.  And then I went to the office.  You do shit a lot during the show.  Not usually.  No, you said I have to.  I have to.  You've heard of it.  He said it.  I want to know some of the mom bits that were playing Thanksgiving. 
[02:02:30]  Because we should promote this.  Jim Brewer's mom story.  Oh, shit.  That's got to be number one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's their...  If you guys haven't heard the Jim Brewer where we prank called Jim Brewer's mom.  That's the one you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, is that tragic.  The setup and the actual call.  Very good.  Michael K. Williams calling his mom live on the air.  Very good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The saga of Danny and Travis's mom.  Oh, boy.  Mom's mom.  They have two separate moms.  Yes, yes.  There's one...  What about Jimmy's mom?  Yeah, there's...  With the famous voicemail. 
[02:03:00]  Well, there's that.  There's also a bit where Jim thinks that his parents are swinging.  Because they go out to dinner and dates with other couples.  I forgot about that one.  That one made me laugh really hard.  Oh, my God.  I told Eric that I needed him for the special to find Jim telling the story of bringing prostitutes  into his house while he lived with his mom.  Oh, right.  I'm still looking for that one.  Any of my mom's stories make it or are they too tragic?  No, they're...  They should all make it.  This is just sad.  That's my whole show. 
[02:03:30]  No, there is.  There's some long rants from you.  You haven't picked one yet?  No.  There's a short one about...  The infamous one about your mom and Jane Seymour, but you had some...  That gaunt.  Not my mom.  Jane Seymour.  You had some segments that seem more like therapy breakthroughs.  Those are great.  You should play some of them, too.  The Blue Comb.  There's a fucking awful bunch of stuff.  Oh, the Blue Comb.  Oh, my God.  Stuff on the driveway.  And the tweezers.  Yeah, there's some...  What about Ant?  Ant?  Well, there's... 
[02:04:00]  It might have been run through so many times.  There's small bits of Ant and his mom, but most of them...  They don't have to be long form.  They can be quick hits.  Well, a lot of them either involve Sal or his dad, but they don't really focus on his mom  too much.  Right.  It's the old arguments back in the old days.  The spaghetti against the wall.  I found one bit where you were complaining that your mom dressed too hot when she took you  on field trips.  Yeah, field trips.  Are we going to do Jim Jeffery's mom, too?  Yes, that one's in there.  That's a good one.  We called his mom the name of the circus elephant.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gunta.  Gunta. 
[02:04:30]  Gunta.  Gunta.  Veronica doesn't get it.  Veronica, go ahead.  Veronica.  Veronica.  I hate fucking Elvis Costello.  I just wanted to say, I think I can't follow the logic of today is Thursday, tomorrow is  Friday.  Well, you're right.  How many days do you have to work this week?  Two and a half.  I work for the school district.  All right, so you're almost at Thursday.  Today's Wednesday.  No, but today's Monday.  The kids are in Monday mode.  It's Monday. 
[02:05:00]  Monday.  Why are they in Monday mode?  They're not in Monday mode.  No one's in Monday mode if you know you're not doing five days.  Right.  Yeah, but it makes a week faster.  I get what's his name?  Bloddick.  No.  What's his name?  That's good.  Sam Roberts.  That's what he should be.  What's his name?  Primetime Sam Roberts.  Primetime what's his name?  Another broad just showing she's dumb.  No, no, no.  Everyone knows today's Thursday.  This broad is right.  No, no.  Everyone knows today's Monday.  You wake up.  You don't want to go to work.  It's Monday.  Right.  You got another couple days.  Oh, really?  Then what happens when Wednesday hits? 
[02:05:30]  Holy shit, I get all these free days.  What?  That's right.  That's right.  You get to party.  So you're feeling...  There's no parties on Wednesday.  That's the problem.  That's why my logic is brilliant.  That's right.  It's a special treat party.  No, it's not a special treat party.  No, it's not a special treat party.  Because you know by Monday that it's going to happen.  Now, you're telling me that even though you don't have to work a full week, this Monday  feels exactly like every other Monday, even when you've got to work five days.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't.  That's dumb.  That's stupid.  You're lying.  That's dumb.  It's so cool that even a Monday feels good. 
[02:06:00]  Like, I feel great today.  So even Monday doesn't feel shitty for me.  But that makes it not a Monday.  It's an exciting Monday because there are treat days coming.  No.  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are treat days.  No such thing as an exciting Monday.  Sam likes treat days.  No, you go into weekend mode, so you might as well make them weekend days.  It's Thursday by proxy.  Thank you.  No, they're not weekend days because those are so typical.  No.  They have been 52 times a year.  110 if you count both days.  You guys are crazy.  This is dumb argument Thursday.  I'm sorry.  You guys are smart and everything else. 
[02:06:30]  And when I turned on the radio, I did think it was a taped show today.  See, I told you.  Oh, see.  But we told everyone it wasn't.  No.  See how easy that was?  So there.  Today's Monday.  I made me polish in blonde, but I really did think it was a taped show.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, that's blondes.  Blondes are dumb, right?  I guess I got to say.  That's what I hear.  Oh, my dear.  Oh, boy.  How many blondes does it take to suck my dick?  What about Antsbomb singing Janis Joplin?  Perfect.  Look at him.  He's just socializing with people so he didn't even hear it. 
[02:07:00]  Is he just chatting out there?  He's taking another shit.  Jesus.  That boy likes to shit.  That's a classic one from Ant's mom.  We haven't played in a while.  All right, Veronica.  Thank you.  Do you like Elvis Costello, or what's the Veronica thing?  Veronica thing is my house.  Archie's?  Archie's had a Veronica?  Yeah.  I'm more of the old school kind of club music and boring stuff that you guys don't like.  What happened?  I said I like the club music, freestyle.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. 
[02:07:30]  What's up, sweetie?  I hate that shit.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, have a good Wednesday or whatever you think today is.  No, it's Thursday.  It's Monday.  It's Thursday.  Sorry, sorry.  It's so Thursday.  Who's excited for Wednesday?  I am.  Thursday means you can, like, Tuesday you can go out.  No, today you can even do happy hours.  A lot of people do happy hours on Thursday.  Tuesday you can go out.  No one does a Monday happy hour.  It's so exciting, because usually you can never go out on a Tuesday, but I do whatever I want,  even though it's Tuesday. 
[02:08:00]  I think we're just going to have to agree that this is a stupid argument.  All right.  Eric, it's mom singing.  We haven't played that in a while.  Oh, yeah.  We could put that in there, too.  I hear it on promos.  We have that, the Drew Boogie remix one, and her performing live at the Hard Rock, too.  Oh, right.  Beautiful.  See, we mix it up a little bit this time.  And we found Sam's mom's first call to the show.  Oh, my God.  I bet you we were really nice.  It was back at NEW.  Guess what's in your pants?  Oh, no.  Were we nice to her?  Yeah, it starts off where we found out that she would come on the air. 
[02:08:30]  We're like, no, tell her we'll be okay.  We're not going to attack her.  Oh, not yet.  We lulled her into a false sense of security.  We should do a first call, current call, to see how it drastically changed.  My dad told me that he likes when E-Rock calls to get my mom on the phone, or to get him on the phone,  because E-Rock still, like, they know the deal, but E-Rock still does, like, radio producer, like, he does his role.  And he calls up, and he goes, hi, Mr. Roberts, this is Eric from the Opie and Anthony.  Eric's been in my house. 
[02:09:00]  And he goes, this is Eric from the Opie and Anthony show?  Opie and Anthony show?  I'm on the toilet right now.  And he goes, we wanted to talk to Mrs. Roberts if she has a second.  The guys will be really nice.  They're not going to take...  And my dad's just like, who are you talking to?  Oh, come on.  Somebody's parents.  You got to be nice.  And then he has to take a break to shit real quick.  Yeah.  We got an amazing joke coming in from Buffalo.  Oh, cool.  This one is fucking... 
[02:09:30]  This is a home run.  Brett and Buffalo, sorry about your bills.  What do you got today?  Oh, come on.  They're horrible.  It's all right.  What the hell is that?  Oh, come on.  Atta boy, Brett.  Atta boy.  Jesus, Brett.  High school, we used to...  I'm a very non-diverse high school.  And free blessings in the school.  And we used to have Mondays because nobody likes a Monday.  Yeah.  Uh-oh. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  Your phone actually crapped out.  I know.  He's not going to believe us.  Your phone really did crap out.  I live in...  I'm currently in Montana with the Border Patrol and in the middle of nowhere.  It's horrible.  All right.  Let's try it again, Brett.  Because everyone's saying it's a fantastic fucking analogy.  All right.  I grew up in a very un-diverse high school.  And we had like three black kids there.  And we used to call them Mondays because nobody likes a Monday. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, I don't get it.  You don't get it?  Nobody likes Mondays.  Come on.  But what about the people that like black people?  What?  Don't I like about black people?  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense because some people do like black people.  So nobody...  Nobody likes Mondays.  And nobody likes black people.  Come on.  But there are people that like black people.  So what are the Jews?  Like Sunday afternoons?  Puerto Ricans are Wednesday?  Absolutely.  As a jovial racist? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, I know.  Well, it's white people are Saturday because everybody likes white people.  Do you guys get it?  I do not.  No.  Yeah.  Jimmy doesn't get it.  You're killing me.  No, I'm serious.  I'm trying to get it.  I don't...  I mean, I...  I make jokes for a living.  I mean, I enjoy jest.  I just don't understand what your thing is.  I'm not saying it's a bad joke.  You don't think it's a bad joke?  No, I'm not saying it's a bad joke.  I just don't get it.  Yeah, we don't really get it.  Sometimes you've got to explain the joke.  Yeah, I'm not saying it stinks.  I don't get it.  I want to get it.  There's been times we go, Jimmy, could he explain that joke?  And he does. 
[02:11:30]  And then we're like, oh, now we get it.  And then we move on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everybody dreads Monday coming around, correct?  Yeah.  Nobody likes Mondays.  You know, they're horrible.  Worst day of the week.  Same thing with black people.  You hate when they come around.  Nobody wants them to be around.  They smell funny.  You know, all that stuff.  Yeah, but why are you saying they have dreads?  It makes no sense at all.  How does it not make sense?  Because you said they're all wearing dreads.  Everybody dread wears dreads on Monday?  Not all blacks wear dreads.  That's what?  Dread them coming around. 
[02:12:00]  Dregs?  You are not in favor of them.  Not dreadlocks.  Oh.  Like dreads.  I think you said they're all wearing dreads when they come around.  I'm like, what?  Dreading something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To dread.  Right.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  So black people don't like Mondays either.  Right.  I get it.  But I don't know where the joke part is.  So only black people like Mondays?  Sure.  Why are you getting uptight?  We're just trying to understand.  Yeah, answer obey. 
[02:12:30]  You guys are breaking up real bad.  I've got to let you go.  All right.  I'll go later.  All right.  There it is.  Border patrolman.  Did he say he was?  Yes.  He's only letting Mexicans through.  Jesus Christ.  You guys want to do some math?  Yeah.  By the way, Kevin from Connecticut shocked that we don't like Elvis Costello.  Fucking never liked Elvis Costello.  I'm sorry.  I didn't either.  I like one song.  Peace, love, and understanding.  Maybe.  Listen.  I know this world is killing you. 
[02:13:00]  What song was that?  Allison.  Allison.  People love Elvis Costello to this day, man.  He sells out, but I never fucking liked it.  I just don't.  I see.  It's not my style.  Pump it up.  Who's better with Abbott?  See.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought he was better when he was on his own in the white jumpsuit with the cape.  You want to bomb with Costello, I'll bomb with Elvis.  See, people saying for them, today's Friday, and then they get the rest of the year is Saturday 
[02:13:30]  because they're not working until the new year.  That's fucking amazing how great that could be.  Yeah, but then it's going to be a really heavy Monday when you come back.  Yeah.  That's going to be a real Monday.  Oh, yeah, but at least be Monday like you know a Monday to be.  That's all I'm trying to say here.  Someone's got a case of the Mondays.  You get fun Mondays.  Fun days.  Fun Mondays.  That's just making believe Mondays.  No such thing.  That's stupid.  There's no work.  Kevin, what do you got, buddy?  Happy Thursday, everyone.  See?  Sam? 
[02:14:00]  I was kind of wondering where Sam went to school or did mommy not teach you math?  Oh, shit.  You're going to learn some math right now, Sam.  All right.  How many Saturdays are there, Sam?  There's one.  Okay, now if you add them both together, how many is that?  You said it was 110.  I said weekend days.  Okay, listen closely.  You said there's 110 Saturdays?  No, no, no.  I said weekend days.  I said 52 or 110 Saturday and Sunday. 
[02:14:30]  It should have been 104, but I didn't get the difference between 52 and 110.  I just said that wrong.  Depending on company holidays, regular holidays, sick days, and personal days, I'm guessing there's  between 70 and 80 Saturdays a year.  There's about 52.  No, there's not, Sam.  Maybe on the traditional calendar, but we're not going with that.  You should, because some days turn out to be very fun if you do it that way. 
[02:15:00]  All right, but Sam thinks there's 104 Saturdays?  That's just stupid.  No, that's not what he said.  This guy is one of the 80%.  What, Jimmy?  What?  Somebody just quoted a joke that I did before that I forgot about that kind of laugh,  and I'm being a total tool.  You're laughing at your own shit.  I love that.  What is it?  The guy said, that was the best line nobody heard.  That tree comes with audio.  And I said, what is it, bullying?  Sean in California.  Sean. 
[02:15:30]  Yes, sir.  Hey.  So here's why today is Thursday, because yesterday I'm at home watching football, football, pooping  off, having a nice day.  Today's Thursday because tomorrow's Friday, I only have one day to do all the shit I got  to do, because tomorrow's Friday, when typically I'd have the whole week.  So here I am, 544 in the morning on a cool Thursday, trying to get all this shit done so  I can enjoy the rest of my Saturday.  That sounds like a Monday.  That sounds tough. 
[02:16:00]  It's not, though, because if it was Monday in his case, then he would go, oh, I got four  or five days to figure all this out.  Oh, my word.  No, it's a full Monday to make room for a fun Wednesday.  You're going to lose this one, Sam.  I haven't lost it yet.  This guy gets it.  He knows it's Thursday.  In his mindset, he's like, fuck, I got to get all this done before Friday, which is tomorrow.  It's Monday, November 29th.  Thanks.  All right.  Enough of that horse shit.  My God.  The reporter likes to say the C word.  What?  Did we do this one already?  We probably did.  I don't think so.  I think there have been a few instances where this has happened. 
[02:16:30]  Mike Shaw's looking for a little breathing space of his own.  He's now considering fixing his mortgage rate.  Now, the Reserve Bank says that these retail banks didn't ask for this extra time.  It took the decision by itself after having a number of discussions with banks.  And the Central Bank also says that our retail banks are in a much better position this year  than what they were during the credit crunch three years ago.  Heather Duplicy, Ellen.  Thank you.  I don't know.  It's just a...  Credit crunch.  Credit crunch.  That was nothing.  That's nothing.  She would have said the credit crunch and they're a bunch of cunts. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was nothing.  That was a slip up.  Yep.  A mere slip up.  Yep.  Oh, my God.  Hook.  What?  What's that?  I'm saying, do you want the Tom Brokaw tax cunts?  Why?  That was a...  Why would we play that?  That was actually a better cunt.  Was it the best cunt?  Blurting out. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, because he really...  He used to have to emphasize tax cunts.  Yeah, he did.  He really emphasized it.  He was all in.  All right, sure.  The key component in what the president insists is a job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically.  And as NBC David Gregory reports tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful  Ohio Republican who is not convinced that tax cunts are the answer.  Tax cunts?  What?  Tax cunts are the answer. 
[02:18:00]  You could tell him he's running out of air when he does his sentences.  Tax cunts.  And another thing, they started using Tom Brokaw again.  He talks better now than when he was on TV.  Really?  What's that about?  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe the old age is loosening up his vocal cords or something.  Well, he had one bad lung.  He has a new lung.  He has two healthy lungs out.  No.  Is that him?  Oh.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Well, I don't know.  You were too quick on that one.  Medical Jimmy.  I'm like, why am I?  Medical Jimmy. 
[02:18:30]  I know he was having a tough lung.  He's not like Joe Pa.  Joe Pa's got the lung cancer.  Joe Pa.  That was a funny tweet, by the way.  Joe Pa.  Whistleblowing?  Yeah, it was funny.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Joe Pa has the whole fucking sympathy.  I have lung cancer.  Please don't put me in prison thing going right now.  I can't put him in jail, I don't think.  Well, no, but.  I don't know.  No, this thing is getting ugly.  But he's 84.  Some of the tweets, which I thought was funny, every 84-year-old has cancer.  Cancer.  So what's the big deal? 
[02:19:00]  I'm a busy guy.  But his son's saying Joe Pa's cancer is treatable.  What does that mean?  That means they'll be able to extend the time before it kills him?  One cancer is a motherfucker, right?  It's terrible.  Oh, man.  You're just trying to breathe.  You see those people with, like, fucking lung cancer or emphysema, and they just...  Just gasping for it.  It's got to be a bad way to go, man. 
[02:19:30]  It's horrible, man.  That one's bad.  What happens, like, with lung cancer?  You figure, you know, the end is going to be you just can't breathe, and you die.  Like, what happens with that liver thing, and then...  Like, what's that like?  Do you just sit there and go, ah, my liver isn't livering.  I have to die.  Or, oh, my kidneys.  Oh.  And it poisons your system, and then, what, you get a fever and die?  Like, you know, what's that last second like? 
[02:20:00]  You should get someone on the phone who might know.  Ah.  Yeah, he works at a hospice, that ghoul.  Yeah, I know.  I don't want to know about death shit today.  The liver swells up, and your system gets...  Everything in the liver should be filtering.  It's not filtering.  So you're just getting pure poison.  Yes.  In your system.  You hear him smiling, pure poison.  Poison.  You hear him smile through his words.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I don't know how the liver works when it shuts down. 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  I finally get the Sopranos ending.  No, you don't.  Yeah, I do.  No one does.  It's, it's, it's, he's making a statement, there's no God, and that's how you die.  All of a sudden, just, the light turns off.  The computer turns off.  No, the show turned off.  The show was over.  No, he died.  There's no more time left on the clock for the TV show.  He got, he got killed.  And that's it.  Boom.  Instant.  Death.  Blackness.  See you later.  What killed him?  I don't know that part.  Because if it was a gunshot, you would have heard, like, the beginning of a gunshot real 
[02:21:00]  quick.  You wouldn't hear the gunshot.  Real quick, you would hear, like, the very beginning real quick.  Maybe, because bullets go faster than the speed of sound.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, shit.  Technically, I don't think you would hear the, anything that resembles a gunshot.  Because you'd be dead instantly.  I read an analysis of that last scene online one time.  It was pretty interesting.  The guy went with the bells.  And it is really a well-written, long analysis of that final scene.  And then I heard David Chase said, no, he lives.  See? 
[02:21:30]  If the writer says that he lived, then he lives.  David Chase officially said that?  I believe he has said that, yes.  Can you check that?  I think David Chase has finally said he didn't die.  Really?  Yeah.  Like, discussing this fucking...  Oh, fuck me, man.  I watched it again, though, recently.  Five years later.  But it was good.  And it did get people...  God, you know, you gotta give them credit, man.  People are still...  Oh, yeah.  ...realizing that last scene.  Yeah, I guess the mission accomplished there. 
[02:22:00]  Instead of just doing something that was kind of an ending.  Yeah.  Kind of made it weird.  I don't know.  I haven't watched the show.  Well, maybe it's...  I would like to watch it in its entirety.  There are no esoteric clues in there.  There are no Da Vinci code.  Oh, come on.  There's something.  Maybe he's getting at where all of a sudden, like, you just stop having that person in  your life.  And we stopped having that person in our life.  See?  Hey, my old friend used to talk about that.  He said once, one day, we're gonna say goodbye for the last time, and not because one of 
[02:22:30]  us dies or anything.  It's because our lives just officially have moved on.  Well, that's true.  And if you think back in your past, you've had all these friends that you would never  imagine would not be in your life anymore.  But they're living their lives, and you moved on a long time ago.  And they might as well be dead.  Yeah.  Think about it.  For how much they, you know...  But one day, you said, all right, take care.  You know, I'll call you tomorrow, whatever it would be.  Right.  And you never did.  And their lives are now somewhere else.  But you don't know it's the last...  That's what I mean.  You just don't know it's happening when it is going down. 
[02:23:00]  You don't know in that moment, like, this is the last time I'm ever gonna see you.  Right.  It's really weird.  It's so depressing when you look back on it.  Especially, I think, when it's death.  When it's choice, it's not as bad.  Because you're like, oh, yeah, I was gonna call him that one time.  But, hey, I heard he was doing good.  Right.  There's still some usually weird connection.  Right.  You can at least know the person's doing okay through third party.  Yeah.  But when somebody dies, even if it's a year or two or three later, you're like, oh, I  didn't know it was the last time I was ever gonna see a person.  Well, that's... 
[02:23:30]  You can wrap your mind around that better than just somebody that you were really close to.  And all of a sudden, one day, you just left and that was it.  Yeah.  You'll never see him again.  David Chase said Tony did not get whacked.  Yeah.  I don't see.  He did say that.  He was surprised how many people actually wanted him to get killed.  Yeah.  He said right here...  I mean, I get these guys want to be artists and stuff, but why not explain it?  I think it would be so cool to just hear his explanation why he filmed it that way.  I wonder if he didn't think people would interpret it as Tony being killed because no one pulled 
[02:24:00]  a gun out.  There was nothing aggressive happening.  I don't know if he just didn't know how to...  Everything looked suspicious.  It was tense.  Everything was suspicious.  Exactly.  That's right.  I think he knew that people were expecting something and he just...  Nothing.  Whatever.  Life goes on.  Yeah.  Let's just explain it.  You had something in mind when you filmed the scene.  What was it?  That's all I want to know.  Right?  Please? 
[02:24:30]  Do you know why my ex thought he got killed?  Why?  She told me that because she really thought that Journey song was,  Don't Stop, Get Even.  Oh, no.  She didn't know it was Don't Stop, Get Even.  Oh, Jesus.  She thought the song was, Don't Stop, Get Even.  Don't Stop, Get Even.  And she's like, I thought that's why they killed him.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That made me laugh.  Don't Stop, Get Even.  Get Even.  Yeah.  Do, do, do. 
[02:25:00]  Ah, yes.  Tony describes his death in season three.  What?  So we have to, like, do a puzzle thing here.  Turk, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  How many years has The Sopranos been off the air?  Uh, like seven.  Seven?  Seven years.  Five?  Really?  All right.  I thought it was only five.  What do you got, Turk?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, um, in season three, I think Tony describes, like, his death, and he says that it'll happen  with some guy that you've never seen before with a members-only jacket. 
[02:25:30]  And if you look at that last scene, he gets followed into the men's room with a guy in,  like, I think it's like a hand-members-only jacket.  He didn't get followed into the men's room.  The guy went in.  But they did, like, you do see the guy going in.  But maybe that's David Chase's way of going, fuck you, I told you what this was going  to be in season three, and if you're not smart enough to put it all together, I'm not going  to tell you.  By the time The Sopranos was halfway through season four, there were more loopholes.  I mean, not loopholes.  That's a good point, too.  There were more plot holes and things that never got answered. 
[02:26:00]  But if he describes his own death, and the final scene is a suspicious-could-be-a-death  scene, and there's a guy with a members-only jacket.  Now I respect Chase, because he might be, like, saying, look, if you're not smart enough  to fucking find one, I'm not explaining it to you.  What happened to the guy in Pine Barrens, then?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, if we're that detailed, what happened to the guy in Pine Barrens?  What are you, an open-miker?  What do you mean?  I've heard open-mikers do that joke.  Oh.  It wasn't a joke.  I really wanted to, I mean...  No, but in his world, maybe it was a callback to what this guy is describing, but maybe it's 
[02:26:30]  just, like, the guy didn't kill him because it's going to come in a way that is so benign and  normal-looking, you constantly have the possible threat of that.  There's always going to be a guy with a members-only jacket.  Right.  There's always going to be a guy in a diner who you don't know who looks at you weird  for whatever reason.  Yeah.  Like, maybe that's the point of it, is that this guy didn't kill him, but that's what  it's like.  Every guy is somewhat suspicious.  But also think Omar, man.  No one expected Omar to die the way he did.  Like, it was just a throwaway thing.  But it wasn't that big of it.  Maybe David Chase was already on that fucking game. 
[02:27:00]  Like, look, you know, when Tony does die, it's just going to be a throwaway thing.  It's like it's going to be this over-the-top fucking gun battle.  Well, who did the...  I always mix the Sopranos and Wire up.  David Simon said, I'm going to break your heart.  That's what he said about The Wire.  He said, I'll break your heart.  Meaning we weren't getting...  He broke my heart.  Yeah.  He really did.  Oh, it crushed me.  Yeah.  I didn't get the big battle.  That was a bad one.  Hey, Turk, thanks, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, guys.  I kind of like that.  Maybe Chase said, fuck you if you can't follow along. 
[02:27:30]  I got a surprise for everybody.  Oh, good.  Bob Eatman on the phone.  Guys, I've been listening to this show.  Remember our live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe?  Yes.  Who was the star of this show?  Chip?  Well, there were a lot of stars, certainly.  Chip thinks it was himself.  Of course it was.  He was running around and stuff.  I would say a karaoke guy was.  Jordan. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah, he was.  I thought Jordan was great.  Jordan.  Yo.  What's up, guys?  Jordan, I got to ask you.  You came on a bit strong at the Hard Rock Cafe.  I know I did.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Are you a fan of the show?  Oh, dude, I've been listening to you guys.  I think the last time I listened to you is when you got off the air because that guy  fucked the other girl in the church in any event, so it's kind of ironic that guy's dead  of a heart attack, but that was the last time I listened to your show, actually.  Oh. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, so you're not a fan of the show, obviously.  No, I'm a fan of the show.  I've been listening to you guys the whole morning.  I fucking love you guys.  I love you guys.  I love this special monster ring.  It's probably one of my favorite stand-ups of all time.  Oh, thank you, man.  But you basically called Jimmy a hack in front of a lot of people.  No, he didn't, did he?  Yeah, he was beating you up pretty good, but you were in Chip character.  Yeah, he did say in a few years he'll be more famous.  Yeah, he didn't have more money.  You didn't hear that because you were in Chip mode.  Maybe he was talking about Chip.  I don't know.  I think it was the fact that I, well, I got home. 
[02:29:00]  I was mad because I pretty much went down there, spent like $40 fucking dollars on the  train ticket, and I got told, oh, the karaoke contest was going for people who were bracelets.  Are you fucking kidding me?  But you were in the karaoke contest at that point.  Yeah, in the end you were in it.  Yeah, I finally got more.  But you're not even a fan of the show, so you got a freebie.  But you said you've only listened today and, I think, nine years ago.  Nine years ago.  Yeah, well, I was obviously gone for a while. 
[02:29:30]  I was doing other stuff.  Gone for a while.  But even when you're gone for a while, I don't know, you might hear us somehow.  Well, now I just subscribed to Sirius today.  Okay.  Oh, good, man.  Why did you pick the one song that Anthony is known for?  That was kind of some passive-aggressive stuff.  I did not know that you were known for that.  I would have sang some Sinatra and Boo Boy, but you guys only brought down like 13 songs.  Oh, there you go.  Well, that is true.  He hasn't been listening for many years. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  You explained that, too.  You didn't know.  All right.  Jesus.  Why are you calling today?  Just to say hi, I guess?  Yeah, I'm saying hi, and I want to call in every day because I enjoy you guys.  I love you every day.  You want to call in every day?  Every day, huh?  I think so.  This is a weird song.  I think so.  It's a weird song.  What am I, a creeper?  No, you're not a creep.  You want to sing for us?  Because that's what you know him for.  I don't know if I can sing right now.  The Bublé thing.  Well.  Yeah, what do you got?  You got something in you you can do over the phone. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, I can do it.  Okay.  What do you got?  All right.  Well, I got Feeling Good by Michael Bublé.  Michael Bublé.  Bublé.  Do we know this song?  Yeah.  We do?  Yeah.  All right.  It's a very good song.  All right.  Do you want me to do the whole thing?  Yeah, the whole thing would be terrific.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Well, acapella.  Acapella.  All right.  This is going to make history.  Belt it out.  Don't fucking skimp.  No, I'm not going to skimp.  Hopefully it sounds good on fucking air because my phone is terrible. 
[02:31:00]  Put the phone down.  You know what I mean?  So it doesn't over-modulate.  No, it's okay.  Birds flying high.  You know how I feel.  Sun in the sky.  You know how I feel.  Breeze drifting on by.  You know how I feel.  It's a new dawn.  It's a new day.  It's a new life for me. 
[02:31:30]  You think he's still singing?  And he doesn't even know the gag because he hasn't listened in nine years.  He hasn't listened.  But he's going to call every day now, so we've got that to look forward to, which is nice.  He's going to call back because he thinks he legitimately got disconnected.  Oh, that's fucking great.  Yeah, he did get disconnected.  Fuck, I hope he calls back. 
[02:32:00]  David Chase has also said there were no other clues in other episodes, according to Ahmed in Tampa.  Yeah.  David, just tell us what it was then.  He survived.  Yeah, he's saying nothing happened.  Fuck, Jordan's back.  Thank God.  Cool.  Jordan, you hit your phone, I guess?  No, I didn't hit my phone at all.  I think somebody fucking hanged up on me.  No, it's impossible from where I sit.  No, I'm serious.  Well, that's unbelievable because my phone's fine. 
[02:32:30]  There's nothing wrong on my phone.  Cell phone?  That's okay.  The phones here are computerized.  The phones here go through a computer system.  It's not like you just call and we pick up.  It might have been a glitch on our end.  That happens sometimes.  We lose all phone lines.  No, that was sounding good.  People are like, fuck, he sounds just like Buble.  You want to continue the song?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I want to continue from the next verse because I know the whole fucking song.  All right.  Like, Jim Norton knows his comedy.  That's right.  That's cool.  Jimmy does know his comedy, sir.  Yes, he does.  All right.  Jordan, who has a fantastic voice.  He was a big hit at our live broadcast. 
[02:33:00]  This is more conducive to his singing than I think the Neil Diamond was.  This is more, you know, your style.  Neil Diamond was kind of a, I just had to sing something on a whim.  Okay.  Second verse.  Yeah, it's more your style.  I had to be the guy up there and I had to be the douche, but that's not who I am.  No, we get it.  We get it.  That's funny.  You got to start it right where.  I missed.  Yeah, because then we could edit it together and play it all nice.  It's in its entirety.  It's like the second you know how I feel.  Yeah.  We heard the second you know how it feels or whatever. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, and then you said I'm feeling good and then.  Yeah, okay.  You're good.  I'm going to do the second verse.  All right.  Here we go.  Jordan, everyone.  Fish in the sea, you know how I feel.  Butterflies are having fun, you know what I mean.  Sleep in peace when day's done, that's what I mean.  In this old world, there's a new world.  In a world for me. 
[02:34:00]  That's the dumbest bit ever.  I'll be the first to admit it.  My favorite part is so we can edit it together and play it nice.  What?  For who?  Yeah.  When will we be doing that?  Put these pieces together in a row so it sounds like one song.  So we can play it nice.  Play it nice.  For who?  Nice.  We've got to get the engineer in here.  Look at these phones.  Yeah, that's tough. 
[02:34:30]  Fucking phones.  Phew.  God damn.  It just never ceases to amaze me.  There's always something wrong around here.  I know.  God damn phones, man.  They're constantly fucking up.  Is Mars on the phones?  He's supposed to be fixing it.  Better bet.  I don't know where he is right now.  Mars is working on the phones, hopefully.  Fuck, man.  Jordan, we owe you an apology, sir.  That's okay.  You know what?  I would like to actually start the whole freaking thing over because it actually would sound better  if it was just fluid and not...  Yeah, I get it. 
[02:35:00]  Hold on, though.  To be completely honest, I can't guarantee that the phones are going to go out.  I'm waiting for Mars.  Mars is checking on something?  I think he said it.  Hold on, Jordan, because we want to make sure we can play this in the future.  Nice.  Yeah.  Maybe part of a best of or something.  I can wait patiently while you guys fix the issue.  That's all.  Well, when are we going to know, Sam?  Is he working on it right now?  Yeah, he's working.  He's under the phones.  Where do you sing normally?  The singing that I do, I don't do comedy. 
[02:35:30]  I've just been on the open mic circuit.  I've been trying to make...  Your comedy's pretty good, man.  I wouldn't downplay that.  Mm-hmm.  But the singing, though.  Yeah.  Like I said, certain songs...  On Wednesdays and Sundays, I do karaoke at Lulu's Village Pub in Port Jefferson.  You can find them on luluslive.com.  Okay.  Getting the thumbs up from Mars.  Yeah, he's saying it should work fine now.  Okay.  Let's all keep our fingers crossed, because this Jordan certainly sounds like Michael Buble.  Fucking bullshit.  You need anything from us? 
[02:36:00]  A little reverb or anything?  You good?  Do you guys have the instrumental at all, or no?  I don't think so.  Not in the system.  Unfortunately not.  Okay.  Believe me, the a cappella was doing...  You're doing a great fucking job on that one, man.  You're tearing it up.  Well, I'm not saying a cappella.  I don't need the music in the back.  You're very smooth.  It's very common.  It's like soulful.  It sounds like really cool without...  There's a lot of music behind it to tell you the truth.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  I'm going to start over from the beginning.  Mars is promising us that the phones are okay, right?  He said it should...  Yeah.  He's saying it should work fine now. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  He's not a problem.  Thank you for your patience, Jordan.  This is worse than fucking Booby Gate.  Oh, my God.  This is terrible.  I know.  I know.  I know.  But we definitely want to replay this someday nice.  Yeah.  Piece it together.  Bring boom.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Here we go.  Birds flying high.  You know how I...  Oh, isn't that great? 
[02:37:00]  Holy shit.  We're done, right?  There's no way he'll go four.  I would bet a lot of money he'd don't go four.  I didn't think we would get three.  Birds flying high.  You click.  Blow me.  Oh, he's still singing right now.  That's great.  There's no way he goes four, right? 
[02:37:30]  Birds flying high.  And I'm feeling you.  All right.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, that's fucking...  Mars said it was fine.  And then we get...  Someone else tried.  There's no way.  More shit.  There's no way he goes...  God damn it.  Where's Mars?  I don't even know why the...  Mars is getting fired over this.  Why we bothered doing a fucking show.  Yeah, I mean, it's not...  If the fucking phones aren't working.  Eh, whatever.  I think...  Were you having trouble with the other guys before when they were calling in with their lame-ass jokes? 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Well, that might have been a sole service, because it sounded like the phone itself was crapping out.  But what's happening here, this fucking phone is going dead.  It's just a switch.  You know?  It's a fucking switch.  Shuts the fucking...  Yeah, I'm a techist.  I know that.  Phone's off.  What'd you say?  No, I do tech work for...  Well, I used to do it for a living.  I just lost my job two weeks ago.  So you understand that.  Mars said he found a loose wire.  Yeah, great. 
[02:38:30]  But he doesn't...  I gotta know, besides Michael Bublé, what other songs suit your voice, though?  I can see you doing Sinatra, yeah.  Don't we want the whole Bublé thing?  No, I want the Bublé.  So we can play it back nice.  I fucking apologize, but it can just...  We get this on tape.  You want him to try it again?  I'm not even sure if the phone ain't gonna hang up, but...  I can't even guarantee you the phone's working.  Mars, are the phones working? 
[02:39:00]  Hold on, Mars is coming in.  We can cut all the other stuff out when we replay this.  Jordan, I think Mars owes you an apology.  He's running down the hall.  Well, yes.  Well, how about...  I don't think...  Hold on.  Hold on, Jordan.  I personally don't think we should do this again unless we get a guarantee from Mars  that these fucking phones are gonna work.  Hey, sorry, guy.  What was the problem with the phones?  Well, you know, the hub gives me problems in a while, and I had to unplug the Cat 5 that  was connected to it.  Is this the Cat 5 again?  Yeah, it's the Cat 5. 
[02:39:30]  Get a new fucking cable.  They cost two bucks.  Well, I remade the end.  We'll see if everything works fine now.  And can you apologize to Jordan, because he's got a golden voice, and we're trying to  get a good copy of this Michael Blaise song.  Hey, Jordan, I'm sorry for my incompetence.  That's okay.  I deal with it on a daily basis.  Yeah, he's Puerto Rican.  You understand.  You know how those people are.  You're forgiven, Mars.  You're forgiven.  I'm not gonna send you to Uranus.  Whoa!  He got you! 
[02:40:00]  Loomoo's live, Mars.  Mars, you giving us the thumbs up?  Yes, we're good to go.  All right.  All right.  Belt it out.  Fucking just belt.  I know you've done it already, but belt it out like it's the first time.  All right, man?  Yeah, of course.  You got it.  Well, if I hear the hang-up single, I'm calling my back.  All right, man.  Okay.  Birds.  Birds.  You're a bird brain. 
[02:40:30]  Come on.  I like how we're all talking him up and giving him confidence and praise.  We should get a different engineer in here, maybe.  You're a golden voice.  He was a golden voice.  Oh, yeah.  Damn it.  I mean, if he's not reliable, Mars doesn't know what he's doing, apparently.  Does Mars never know what he's doing?  I don't know.  I mean, we need the phones to do this.  Jordan.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing. 
[02:41:00]  I don't know what he's doing.  Is this like a practical joke or something?  No, if it was, we wouldn't do it four fucking times in a row.  Yeah, that would be running something to the ground.  We don't do that on the show.  What?  Jesus Christ.  I think it would be better for me to just come in and sing live.  Yeah, it might be right.  I agree.  This is fucking infuriating.  But we do got him.  You want to try it one last time?  Because we've got to have it on tape, at least to intro.  Like, this is the way the full song sounded on the phone.  And this is the way it's like in the studio.  Yeah, because you can't really tell over the phone. 
[02:41:30]  I can't get past the fucking first, like, second line of the song and I get disconnected.  Fuck, man.  That might be in the...  Yeah, I don't know.  I wonder if it's something to do with the actual singing.  Like, if some fucking...  What am I, like, a...  A tune.  What, I got, like, a voodoo curse on me?  No, it might be some kind of audio thing because we...  Over-modulating, maybe?  We can talk.  Yeah, maybe try holding the phone away a little bit from your mouth.  Are you holding it like a microphone or something?  It's drawing.  No, I'm holding my phone right up to my head.  Yeah, hold it a little further away.  It might be over-modulating and then just cutting the line. 
[02:42:00]  Because we can...  Because we talk and it's fine.  And we can bump it up in post so we play this back nice.  Yes.  Well, how about I put you on speakerphone and I put the phone away from me?  That's fine.  Perfect.  Speaker could probably fucking do it.  Perfect.  Over-modulating.  That voice is just too good for your fucking serious XM.  That's actually...  You know what?  That actually throws a nice fucking echo in it.  Yes.  I'll be honest with you.  All right, man.  You ready? 
[02:42:30]  Yep, I'm ready.  I've been ready.  All right.  Let's fucking keep our fingers crossed here.  Hopefully I can get past the second freaking line.  I know, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Let her rip, man.  Keep it like the first time.  Yep.  I wanted that one to really hurt. 
[02:43:00]  A big over-the-top note.  Come on.  It's got it.  God damn.  I would have bet a lot of money if you would have never made it past three.  That was the drive for five?  That was five.  That's amazing.  Jesus Christ.  Michael Buble.  Michael.  Michael Buble.  We should just play Michael Buble for everyone.  We should.  You got the song?  E-Rock. 
[02:43:30]  Do we have the original?  Yeah, I'd like to hear the original.  Oh, yeah.  I'm looking through his catalog here.  I don't know what the title of that was.  It's got birds in it.  I don't know the other day of the song.  Birds fly away.  Try birds fly away.  Flying high.  Oh, flying high?  Is it I'm feeling good?  And I'm feeling good.  It's called feeling good, yeah.  All right.  Hang on.  Oh, okay.  Here it is.  Oh, wait.  You know what?  Let's just play the Michael Buble song because obviously.  Okay, I got it.  You got it?  Yep.  Let's hear how that sounds.  Birds flying high. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know how I feel.  It's not even as good as when the other guy did it.  No.  Sun in the sky.  You know how I feel.  Jordan.  Jordan actually had more.  We got the song playing.  This sounds thin and wimpy.  Yeah, let's just tell you the truth.  It's like talking over the music.  Yeah.  Jordan had some, like, balls to the song.  Yeah, but there's a softness to the Michael Buble version.  Yeah, but I like, no, I actually like the, uh, the gruffness. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, this is wimpy sounding.  Yeah.  Even without the music, uh, Jordan had like a, had a good strong sound to it, you know?  All right, let's, let's fade this out.  We got Jordan back in line.  Oh, Jordan, what up, man?  What up, man?  I apologize.  I'm not even going to ask you again.  This is stupid.  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to sing.  But, uh, do you want me to come in live?  Because I'll come in tomorrow if you want me.  No, tomorrow's a bad day. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, because we're on vacation week.  Wednesday.  This week, but.  Yeah, probably next week.  Or, I mean, Wednesday might work.  Wednesday, too.  Wednesday?  What do you think, Wednesday?  Yeah, Wednesday I can come in.  You know, I know this is crazy, but we do have you on the phone.  It'd be a shame if the phone's now working.  I mean, but it's really up to you.  If you don't want to try it again, I understand.  We've kind of fucked up your morning here.  But what about Wednesday?  He can come in.  No, he didn't fuck up my morning.  I can come in because I'd rather just come in and sing live, and then I wouldn't have to  worry about the phone disconnecting. 
[02:45:30]  We'll see if the phones are working, and then either way, we could have him in either way.  Yeah, that's true.  We could do both.  We've had you on a minute, and the phone hasn't crapped out, so it's really up to you.  I would understand if you don't want to give another shot, considering, you know, we had  problems.  I'd like to try one more time, though.  All right.  Okay.  He should come in what day, Wednesday or Thursday, because the Thanksgiving show on Thursday,  it's like, that might be cool.  The holiday thing.  That's the most listeners.  Do you do stuff for Thanksgiving?  My Thanksgiving day will be, well, you guys are on at 6 to 10. 
[02:46:00]  Right?  Yeah.  I can do it in the morning.  That's fine, because I don't have anything with my family until the end.  Why don't we do Thursday, then?  Even early.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we do that?  I'd like to do a little Thanksgiving treat and treat the whole world to something different.  Okay.  That'd be cool.  That's fair.  Thursday morning at, what, 6.30?  Let you sleep in a little?  I say, we should start the show that way.  Just start it right off, because we're not going to do a full show.  6?  5.30.  Can you be here at 5.30?  I know that's a little early.  It is early, but we do it every day. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  I can be there at 6.30.  No problem.  5.30, actually.  Yeah.  No, you'd have to be here at 5.30, because the show starts at 6, and we want to start the  show with it.  Yeah.  I mean, just to show the world your gift.  Yeah.  For Thanksgiving.  It's a perfect tie-in, if you think about it.  I can definitely do Thursday at 5.30.  That's no problem.  I'll take a train, because I live out in central Long Island, so it'll probably take me about  an hour to get into the city.  All right.  You can get on at 4 a.m., like 4.15, maybe.  It might be at 4.21.  You know where the studio is?  The studio, could somebody give me directions off air? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It's 178th.  Okay, because I'm going to be taking the train at the Penn Station.  Yeah.  And what would I just take a cab up to?  178th.  178th.  Yeah.  In Amsterdam.  In Amsterdam.  Yes.  Okay, 178th in Amsterdam.  Yeah, I'll see you guys on Thursday morning.  Now, would somebody give me the information so I can get in and everything?  We'll put your name in the system.  Yeah, you just go up to the...  You just got to go up and show ID. 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  Okay.  But try the song again.  Oh, that'll be cool.  You sure?  Why not?  Yeah, one more time, man.  I want to see.  I feel bad, though.  You sure you want to give this another?  I'm going to be there at 5.30 on Thursday anyway.  So I'm just going to try this again.  If it cuts out, it cuts out.  Okay.  And if not, then we'll save the treat for Thursday.  All right.  You're great, dude.  Jordan, you're cool.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  I love Jordan.  Yes.  We like Jordan.  You guys fucking rock.  You're better than Stern.  Thank you, sir.  Well, I don't know about that. 
[02:48:00]  Thanks, man.  He's not here today.  So he can't defend himself with that.  All right, man.  Give it a whirl.  And like I said, hopefully this fucking doesn't cut out again.  But if it does, we'll see you Thursday morning.  Yeah, Thursday morning at 5.30.  I'll be there.  I'll be there right on time.  You got the address?  Yes.  That's 178th and Amsterdam.  Nice.  Okay.  We'll have somebody out there waiting for you.  Cool.  All right.  Here we go.  One last time.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for Jordan.  If it cuts out, I'm not calling back. 
[02:48:30]  And you guys, I'll see you guys on Thursday.  Sounds good.  All right, man.  Burn flying high.  You know how I feel.  Sun in the sky.  You know how I feel.  Burn.  Dummy.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  Holy shit.  Six.  178th and Amsterdam.  That's still in Manhattan, right?  Oh, I have no idea.  That's way the fuck up there.  That's in fucking.  Let's look up 178th and Amsterdam.  That's the Congo.  I was hoping to hit the fucking heart of.  Yeah, I think that's upstate New York.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:49:30]  Let's see how far up this fucking thing goes, man.  Jesus.  Spot crime.  That's the first thing that pops out of it.  It's right at the bridge.  Oh, man.  Oh, it's at the GWB?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little rough up there.  That ain't good.  Oh, that's fucking.  Oh, my God.  It's right off.  Oh, I nailed it.  That's where all the homeless guys go who walk along the side of the bridge?  I fucking nailed it.  Oh, shit.  I nailed it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's not a good place. 
[02:50:00]  That's some of that cross-Bronche shit.  Well, somebody will be waiting for him.  178 in Amsterdam's bed, Mars?  Yeah, that's the cocaine capital of the world, man.  Are you fucking kidding?  Bunch of Dominican-selling coke up there.  That's all you got.  That's the person that's going to be out front waiting for him.  Well, 5.30 in the morning will probably be quiet.  Oh, jeez.  Well.  All right.  Can we go home now, Sam? 
[02:50:30]  That was a bit for the ages.  That was really good.  Can we go now?  No, you can't.  We could take a break.  You have to tinkle.  Yeah, you could take a break.  You still got some things to take a break, read about.  Can I get a napkin?  What do you need a napkin for?  Oppie, can you touch my teeth?  Oppie, could you rub your finger on my teeth?  I need you to moisten.  Why?  What's wrong with that? 
[02:51:00]  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, really enjoying that one.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good weekend yourself, Dr. Steve.  We picked the right phone call together because it was between Jordan and Dr. Steve.  Yes.  Dr. Steve was on hold.  Does Dr. Steve have any shows coming up here?  No.  Every Saturday at 10 p.m.  10 p.m.  Weird medicine.  Very good.  Very funny.  Yeah.  Very informative.  And very disgusting at times.  Right.  Yes. 
[02:51:30]  Like the Dr. Steve.  Did he send the same text to all of us?  Because I got my Dr. Steve.  I think he was going to get our Dr. Steve text.  Come on.  We're on to you.  You got to send separate text messages now.  It's like we all think that you're our pal.  It's like those Christmas cards that are stamped.  You know, we all get them.  Are we getting the email Christmas card this year?  Because this year I fucking tweeted and called that idiot out.  Don't send me an email Christmas card.  I don't want any Christmas cards.  I don't want any information in everyone's name to the human fund. 
[02:52:00]  Seinfeld.  Yes.  I didn't know that one.  That's why I shut my mouth.  Of course.  Seinfeld.  Happy to get bumped for Jordan.  Is this how it...  Did he say it like this?  No.  That was some funny as fuck shit.  Have a great week, bro.  No.  He gave us different...  Oh.  He gave us different fucking...  He's learning.  What did you get?  I got your Valtrexes ready.  I got, oh, there'll be someone.  Waiting outside for him.  You asshats. 
[02:52:30]  Hilarious.  Have a great week.  Plus, you just gave him the corner.  You didn't give him an address.  Oh, we told him someone would be waiting there for him.  No, we said someone was waiting for him outside.  He's waiting right there.  Yeah, right on the corner.  Just go up to the...  Robin.  Go up to the gentleman on the corner.  The gentleman.  The code word is, I need a half.  I dipped my finger in baking soda and rubbed it on my teeth.  Eat.  Why?  Moisten them. 
[02:53:00]  Have you ever been to a doctor, Edgar, about your dry teeth?  No.  Maybe you should see a doctor.  No.  I think it's a salivary gland problem.  I have plaque under my teeth.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  Touch my teeth.  Oh, my God.  When you put your finger on it, when you pull your finger off, your finger sticks to the  tooth.  That's some dry teeth.  Really dry.  Touch, touch.  You got dry inner lips, too?  Yes, I do. 
[02:53:30]  Or gums or whatever?  Yes, I do.  Very dry.  Oh, God.  I took, I took a napkin and was rubbing it.  Lips are chapped.  Green break.  Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Green break.  Dry turkey.  Thanksgiving.  Why would anybody do a morning show on Thanksgiving?  I don't know.  A cop goes, what the fuck did you do? 
[02:54:00]  That guy's in trouble.  Play Alice's restaurant.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I fucking hate that song.  Yeah.  Doesn't Ronnie do it every year?  Well, Alice had a restaurant and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Terrible.  And we took all the garbage to the garbage dump and the...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, God. 
[02:54:30]  I hate people that like this song.  Oh, well, it's fun.  No, it's not.  Oh, it's fun.  Let's play it.  Can we break?  It comes down again.  Yeah, let's break.  We should make people listen to this.  You can get everything you want.  This song is called Alice's Restaurant.  Shut up.  About Alice.  What is this?  And the restaurant.  But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant. 
[02:55:00]  He's occupying somewhere.  I've been there.  Just the name of the restaurant.  Oh, yeah.  Arlo Guthrie.  That's why I called him.  It could be.  He's dead.  I just played that.  You're an asshole.  Arlo sucks.  He's terrible.  They were all from back in the day.  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.  Like, I like that part, and then I hate the rest of it.  Well, this part's good.  Well, make it into a song.  Instead of a dumb, long story that goes nowhere.  Walk right into the ground about just a half a mile. 
[02:55:30]  For some reason, E-Rock doesn't want to get us out of our live show today.  It was a better song.  It was like Mr. Customs Man or something.  Which is similar to this.  No, it's actually a better one.  Did it at Woodstock.  Can we go to break?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN Entry Show. 
[02:56:00]  What's this?  Let me think.  Oh.  Colored, only signposted at Water Fountain.  SUNY New Paltz did that.  It's funny how that's a news story, but yet they won't mention the race of suspects in certain beatings and racial crimes.  Is that why you're playing this song, I guess?  No, not at all.  Oh. 
[02:56:30]  Oh.  I was trying to get topical.  Getting topical.  What?  I don't know.  What does that have to do with this song?  Colored in black music or something?  Oh.  I don't know.  That's ugly.  Let's try.  Colored.  Colored.  Jesus.  It's horrible.  He's colored.  Why is that stuff horrible?  I don't get it.  Well, it kind of symbolizes the degradation of the entire race.  The subhuman treatment.  But then when we're called honky, who cares?  Well, we were kind of the ruling.  Whites, let's say we, the collective, we were the ruling class, so honky was kind of just an innocent reaction. 
[02:57:00]  It didn't have any real behavioral implications, like saying nigger, where people you were saying the two you were treating terribly and didn't have the same rights as you did, so it's a little different.  I don't like the whole African-American thing because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  Like, if they have a suspect and they go, he's described as an African-American male, it's like, how do you know he's not just African?  Well, I guess the thinking behind that was that white people have always been broken down into German, Irish, Italian, Swedish. 
[02:57:30]  There was a country or a cultural connection beyond the color, whereas with black people, they always felt like, you're black, you're Negro, you're this.  You're always connected to a color, but beyond that, it goes nowhere.  But they never say, like, and he's described as an Italian-American.  It might be just an Italian from Italy.  No, but if somebody said, what are you?  It's a white guy.  You say a white guy.  No, no, no, you're right.  But if somebody said, what are you?  I'm Italian.  It's not just for suspect descriptions.  Opie knows he's a Scandinavian or Sam knows he's Jewish.  What?  Whatever you are.  I'm just saying because that beautiful face is what I am. 
[02:58:00]  I'm a mutt.  I really am just a lot of things.  But you might know that you're English and Polish and Scottish or whatever.  A little Polish.  Black people don't know that.  German.  So that's probably where African-American is.  It's just an attempt to have a cultural identity.  I think I got a grandfather from Canada, so whatever the fuck those people are.  Canadians.  Canadians.  No, it's got to be, but no, they get mad when you say that.  They are Canadians, though.  Yeah, but we're Americans, but that doesn't mean, you know what I mean?  But America is different than most countries because we're newer.  So America is only 400 years old, whereas, you know, if you're Italian, 
[02:58:30]  you've been there for...  And they call themselves Italians.  So I'm part Canadian?  That's not...  That's dumb.  You're Canadian-American.  No!  No!  I don't even know if that's true because that's the side that my family,  I don't know anything about.  I've heard rumors that maybe there's some Canadians.  You could do worse.  Any racial stuff you guys need to explain?  I'll be your black representative.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Oh, sure, my friend.  No, I get it.  I was just saying that for the stupid radio.  Whatever. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, I was saying, when we play Call of Duty,  there's a map where you have to play as, like, African villagers,  like people from the fucking Congo or something.  Right.  And, you know, in a first-person shooter,  you could see your hand holding the front of your weapon as you run around.  And, you know, it's a black hand.  And you're like, oh, that's interesting.  We're sharing cultures.  And, you know, but that isn't usually the way it goes down on the game.  I can imagine. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, boy.  If you...  You never hear as many N-bombs dropped as you do when you're playing that map.  On both sides.  And you got the black arm, so you could go,  look, I could say that.  I'm one.  Yeah, yeah.  See, hey, you can't say that, but I can.  I can.  See, my left arm's black.  I'm a computerized black person in this game.  Oh, they really do get rambunctious, though,  when you're playing that map.  Fuck, we did a lot of good stuff today.  All good stuff. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  You hear about the fake doctor injecting.  I did hear about this.  What was it, though?  Cement.  Just cement?  No.  Cement and then that flat tire fixer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, fix a flat.  Yeah, basically fix a fat.  Fix a fat.  Fix a fat.  Eron's going to pick some up.  I was just going to go Bob Kelly.  Fix a flat.  Fix a flat.  Bob Kelly.  Fix a flat.  Yeah, because it's like silicone-based.  So they figure you could just inject it into her ass. 
[03:00:30]  A woman who wanted to work at a nightclub started searching for someone who could perform plastic  surgery at a cheap price to give her a curb of your body.  Police say what she found was a woman posing as a doctor who filled her butt with cement,  mineral oil, and flat tire sealant.  Holy fuck.  I'll fill that ass.  Oh.  Phil Myers!  Phil Myers!  With cement!  Oh my God.  The lady...  Sally Kramer? 
[03:01:00]  The lady's stupid.  The suspect, who police say was born a man.  Yeah.  So the doctor, obviously, the suspect, and identifies as a woman who apparently performed  the surgery on herself.  An investigator says she may have victimized others.  Of course she has.  Yeah, yeah.  She's just pumping that shit in.  That can't be good, right?  No.  Fix a flat?  I wouldn't think so.  See that shit?  Yeah.  Crazy.  Cement?  Cement in your ass?  Yeah.  Some man gets 80 years for buying a hot dog with fake money. 
[03:01:30]  80 years for that?  Three strikes?  Dang.  Was it three strikes?  Oh, you know what?  Probably.  I don't know.  Are there felonies, though?  I don't feel like reading that one.  I don't feel like reading that one.  Two died during the Philadelphia Marathon.  Nah.  We did football.  Didn't even hear about that one.  Oh.  Parents of Adolf Hitler lose custody of newborn.  So they're still having kids?  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  They took the kid away 17 hours after he was born.  It's like state-sponsored kidnapping. 
[03:02:00]  That is...  That's a weird...  How could they take the kid away 17 hours after?  I don't know, man.  That's bizarre.  They're saying that they have unspecified mental and physical issues.  They didn't say...  They're not giving anyone an answer.  They named their kid Hitler.  Everyone else was...  You know, they were all doing fine until they went to get a birthday cake one day a few years back.  And they said, hey, could you put happy birthday Hitler on here? 
[03:02:30]  And it's for Mike's son.  And then some busybody at the store called the cops.  And they found out that the kid was indeed named Hitler.  They had another kid named, what, Arian?  Yeah, I don't remember the names anymore.  The new one that they just took away...  Aaron Himmler.  His name is The Agency.  You know what, man?  I have mixed feelings about this.  Enough already.  These parents are fucking scumbags.  They're like attention whores.  Yeah.  And I know you have the right... 
[03:03:00]  They're your kids.  But it's like all they're doing is make...  They're setting these kids up to be purposely and absolutely ridiculed.  And they're stacking the deck so far against their kids just because they want some attention to make theirs.  They're just fucking scumbags.  But it's their fucking prerogative.  It is.  And for the government to get their fucking schnozzola involved in it is...  It's despicable.  It is.  But I don't know what the conditions were.  Like if there was any abuse or neglect. 
[03:03:30]  Like if there was any excuse to take them.  Because these parents are pieces of shit.  Well, yeah.  Scroll the other way a little bit.  Down.  No.  There you go.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It says...  The judge and the Division of Youth and Family Services told us that there was no evidence of abuse.  And that it was the names...  They were taken over the children's names.  Oh, I don't know about that.  I don't know, man. 
[03:04:00]  I'm fucking crazy.  Yeah, I have mixed feelings.  I kind of am happy because they're shit.  But it's like, can you do that?  I don't think you should be able to do that.  I don't think you should.  Yeah, I think you're right.  Yeah.  It's deplorable.  I'll amend my statement.  Yeah.  If there's no abuse...  But I don't think you should be able to do that, unfortunately.  Occupy Wall Street protesters stay at $700 a night hotel.  Yeah.  What, the leaders?  One guy is in charge of the $500,000 that they have. 
[03:04:30]  He's like a finance guy.  And he's in charge of that money.  And he was staying at the W Hotel.  Wow, really?  $700 a night.  At the W.  Wow.  Wow.  Really protesting the man.  Yeah, yeah.  At the W.  Uh-huh.  And he was paying $700?  They weren't giving him like a rate really cheap?  Nope.  $700 a night.  Wow, what a hipster.  Wants to be at the W Hotel.  And brought a few of the protesters up there to sleep on a little, you know, one of those  fold-out beds that they get.  Yeah.  Yeah, living the life. 
[03:05:00]  Showing them what the 1%ers live like.  And he got confronted and he said, tents are not for me.  Yeah.  He confessed when confronted in the sleek black lobby of the Washington Street Hotel.  Wow, staying at the W Hotel.  Yeah.  Ugh.  And he's described it as a repeat guest, so it wasn't a one-time only thing.  I don't know.  He's been there a bunch.  A few times, whatever.  I would love if he was using that fucking money.  Using some of the stupid protesters' money to stay at the W Hotel.  Ah, it's great. 
[03:05:30]  Are they going to try to set up somewhere else?  Do you know?  There's really no other situation like that.  That was a special situation where it was a park that was privately owned in the city,  and the owner wasn't immediately like, get the fuck out of here.  So I don't know where else they'd go where they wouldn't just be kicked out once dusk rolls around.  It was awesome.  It was a cool fucking thing.  Cool.  Because you don't see shit like that every day.  Well, you see it and then it's gone.  Can't be there forever.  Yeah.  Two months, right?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  It was two months.  Two months is good.  Yeah.  It's definitely over, too.  Like I said earlier, I went down there yesterday to check it out, and wow, they don't want them back.  We're stronger than ever.  It's getting to be that passe feeling to this whole thing, too.  You know, since they broke it up, it's kind of like, really?  Eh, who cares?  No one really gives a shit.  The movement, man.  Well, a lot of people do give a shit.  Eh, not really.  There were thousands of people going over that bridge over the weekend.  Relatively speaking. 
[03:06:30]  Last week, whatever.  Yeah, the marathon pulls out more than that.  And then they shined the big sign on the side of the Verizon building.  That was pretty impressive.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I didn't catch that.  I'm saying 99% right on the side of the building.  Great.  Set that shit up.  It's like a Batman signal.  Oh, wow.  Pretty fucking cool.  These fucking dummies.  I liked them at first, and then I just started to get annoyed at them.  Originally, I did like them, though.  But then I was like, eh.  They're not just protesting against the people I hate. 
[03:07:00]  When you're making regular commuters' lives hard, it's like those are the people who work for a living,  and those are the people who are fucking getting fucked by the government, you dummies.  Believe me, if they were dragging some of these guys out of the houses, like the people that I think should be dragged out and executed in the street,  I would have no issue with it.  But they're not doing that.  They're just protesting rich people in general.  It's like, come on, that's silly.  The wealthy.  Meanwhile, I'm sure they loved staying in that fucking $700 room when that guy brought them up. 
[03:07:30]  You can't be phony if you're doing that type of stuff.  Living large.  Oh, occupies.  That was pretty cool.  Well, they have a little projector.  They projected it up on the side of the building.  Yeah, man.  Back of a truck or something.  What building?  The Verizon building, I believe, if I read that correctly.  I'll show them.  Meanwhile...  That's pretty cool.  Meanwhile, they're using iPhones with Verizon's service.  That's so funny.  That's hilarious.  It's pretty cool they were able to organize to get that shit done.  Yeah, it's a projector.  Big whoop-dee-doo for these fucking faggots. 
[03:08:00]  Jesus, Ant.  Let me ask you...  Have you always been like this?  I know I've known you for like 17 years now.  I really have been.  You've always been like this?  Yes.  I always had kind of a rebel in me.  You've always been like this?  Yeah.  There's that asshole with his stupid head hat.  His hair hat or whatever.  Worst fucking toupee on TV.  Oh, my God.  What's his name?  He's always up there.  If he just pushed down his fake hair, it would be almost passable. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, you could see right under it.  What's his name?  Dude, he's fucking hiding things under there.  Is that keys?  It's a hovercraft of hair above his head.  I don't know what his name is.  You've seen him a million times, right?  This guy.  A candidate with great ideas and thoughtfulness who had a soft voice.  He wasn't even heard.  Well, I mean, also, the interesting thing is, you look at someone like Eisenhower, bald.  You look at someone like FDR, who had a physical.  Mentioned his hair.  Disability.  Yes.  I mean, these things.  She said Eisenhower, who's bald.  And then he kind of went like, oh. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Why can't he just push the fucking hair down a little bit?  His hairline is lifted up where you can see under his wig.  Underneath it.  Why can't he just wear a Mets hat and spray paint that?  It would be more believable.  That is a bad, bad job.  Damn.  He's been on TV a million times.  This country could somehow magically have five minutes alone with a candidate, just the  voter and the candidate, five minutes, one-on-one.  That would change everything. 
[03:09:30]  No, it wouldn't.  That'd be stupid.  How do you make that happen?  Five minutes.  Five minutes with everybody?  That'd take a while.  No shit.  Individually?  One billion, five hundred million minutes, I think.  And you still like the Romney?  Mitt.  Yeah, you know.  Newt Gingrich can't be the president of the country.  He won't be.  No, no, no.  So you only got Romney left at this point.  I think it'll, yeah.  McCain, toast, Rick Perry, toast.  I don't know.  Newt Gingrich is tied right now, though.  It's a year. 
[03:10:00]  Huh?  We've got a fucking year left.  See what happens.  Yeah.  But, um, oh man, what's his name from MSNBC?  He came out talking some shit about Obama on MSNBC.  Chris Matthews?  Chris Matthews.  Wow, he's pretty, uh...  He's fucking saying shit.  In Obama's camp.  And that is like the ultra fucking lib.  What?  Let's see.  Where is that, uh...  Here's...  Let me ask you...  Do you got the video?  I want to hear that.  Let me ask you something, man. 
[03:10:30]  Is it possible that other Democrats run for the presidency?  I know in general...  When was the last time that happened?  I don't know.  That's quite a poo-poo.  Did that ever happen in our history?  Where you had the president...  You have an incumbent president...  That's a Democrat.  Still wants to run.  But they're so unhappy with the job he does that the party itself goes,  Fuck that.  We're gonna, you know, go for the nomination here.  Has that ever happened?  I would love to know.  Didn't...  Not in our lifetime, certainly.  Did it happen with Kennedy when Carter was the incumbent? 
[03:11:00]  Did...  Did...  Did...  Edward Kennedy try to run?  I want to...  I know he stopped some kind of health care.  Carter got the nomination.  They always give it to...  No, no, no.  But I'm thinking, did he try to get it from Carter?  I don't remember.  I'm talking where you go all in and say,  Fuck this.  I'm gonna try to be...  Well, LBJ backed out.  What happened?  He, uh...  LBJ backed out for a second term.  I shall not seek...  Oh, right, right, right.  Nor shall I accept.  No, we're talking about the president.  He's in office.  They usually just give it to him for the next election. 
[03:11:30]  But has there ever been a time in our history  where that party says,  No way, you're too weak.  We're putting other guys in there to protect the party.  I don't know.  That's a good question, I'm thinking.  Be honest, witchy.  Anyone that knows politics a little more than we?  Politics.  We do?  Politics.  Here's the Chris Matthews.  Yeah, here's Chris Matthews.  Kind of not really sounding that hip on Obama.  Something.  There is no Peace Corps.  There is no Special Forces.  There is no 50-mile hikes. 
[03:12:00]  There's no moon program.  There's nothing to root for.  What are we trying to do in this administration?  Why does he want his second term?  Would he tell us?  What's he gonna do in his second term?  More of this?  Is this it?  Is this as good as it gets?  Where are we going?  Are we gonna do something in the second term?  He has yet to tell us.  He has not said one thing about what he'd do in his second term.  He never tells us what he's gonna do with reforming our healthcare systems, Medicare, Medicaid.  How he's gonna reform Social Security.  Is he gonna deal with long-term debt?  How?  Is he gonna reform the tax system?  How?  Just tell us.  Why are we in this fight with him? 
[03:12:30]  Just tell us.  Commander, give us our orders.  Wow, man.  Fuck.  Chris Matthews isn't on your side anymore?  I know.  And he even goes off.  Holy shit.  He goes off more, man.  Yeah, this goes against his commercials that he runs on MSNBC where he's rah-rah Obama  in the White House.  He's disgusted.  He's gonna find that commercial maybe after this, but go ahead.  Tell us where we're going.  Give us the mission.  And he hasn't done it.  And I don't, and I think it's the people around him.  Too many people around him.  Little kids with propellers on their heads.  They're all virtual. 
[03:13:00]  Politics, the social networking.  I get these emails.  You probably get them.  I'm tired of getting them.  Stop giving them to me.  I want to meet people.  Their idea of running a campaign is a virtual universe.  They're sending emails around to people.  No, it's not.  It's meetings with people.  It's forging alliances.  It's White House meetings and dinners parties that go on till midnight, and he should be  sitting late at night now.  I wonder if Chris Matthews was left out of something or a couple of things, and he's  a little annoyed.  Yeah, you think?  I don't know.  I don't know.  He's making great points, though.  Great points, yeah.  And he's completely changed his tune.  He has. 
[03:13:30]  100%.  Wow.  And he makes a great point here, too, because this has, what he says at the end here is  absolute Obama.  Okay.  Yeah.  Someone is saying, all right, finish the clip, and then go ahead.  With senators and members of Congress and governors working together on how they're going  to win this political fight that's coming, I don't have a sense that he's ever had a meeting.  I hear stories that you will not believe.  Not a single phone call since the last election.  Tell me what.  They don't call.  He never calls.  That's the message. 
[03:14:00]  Members of Congress, I keep asking, when did you hear from him last?  Silence.  He doesn't like their company.  That's a problem, by the way.  Dude, if this was on Fox, I'd be like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  This is MSNBC.  He's way liberal, this Chris Matthews.  That's pretty huge.  Holy shit.  Wow.  And Ted Kennedy, John Fox for Brooklyn.  Hey, Jimmy is right.  Ted Kennedy ran against Carter in 1980. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Is that true?  I believe it is.  For the nomination?  I think so.  He was the incumbent president?  And again, I could be pulling this out of nowhere, but I remember, or I think something  about how Kennedy is the one who kind of got, Carter wanted to do some kind of health care,  and Kennedy fought it.  And I guess to hurt Carter so he could get the nomination.  Am I just making that up?  Well, let me go to Lenny in Baltimore.  Lenny, what do you got on this? 
[03:15:00]  Hey, first thing, Jimmy's partially right.  Kennedy ran, but he didn't get the nomination.  Then he gave that big speech at the convention, and everybody remembered it, and they're like,  oh, we should have voted for Teddy instead of Jimmy Carter.  Hold on, hold on.  I remember the big speech.  So he was running against Carter for the party's nomination, even though Carter was  the president?  Right.  Wow.  I bet you can find this speech on YouTube.  I really do, if you look it up.  And then Franklin Pierce, who was president in the early 1800s before Lincoln, who oddly  enough is related to Barbara Bush, was president of the Republicans, who were kind of the liberal 
[03:15:30]  party back then, if everybody remembers.  Yes, when Lincoln was president.  And I forgot who ran against him, but the Republicans did not nominate Pierce.  He's the only incoming president to not get the nomination.  President Budinsky.  Wow, this guy knows his shit.  So Pierce is the president, and he loses his nomination, so he doesn't even get to run  for a second term.  Correct.  Wow.  Am I crazy to think about that health care thing?  Did he do something with that to stop that?  I don't know. 
[03:16:00]  With Ted Kennedy?  Kennedy won in national health care, but I don't remember what Carter was doing.  Okay.  I remember this Ted Kennedy speech.  Well, vaguely.  I remember it was an over-the-top, holy shit moment in politics.  I bet you can find it on YouTube.  No, we have it right there, actually.  Danny found it.  It's long, though, right?  Well, I would assume it's fucking long.  Yeah, fuck that.  Can we hear one minute of it?  Fuck that shit.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah, let's hear excerpt.  Excerpt.  Excerpt's a hard word to say.  Excerpt.  All right, that's good.  Really nice.  In closing.  That was really good.  Everybody's happy.  He's talking. 
[03:16:30]  I kind of like that.  Howard in Georgia.  Yeah, Dick Morris, who planned for Bill Clinton's presidency, has said on Sean Haley times more  than once that Hillary will end up running against Obama.  I don't know.  Do you think?  I think Dick Morris is trying to be...  Don't the Clintons hate Dick Morris now?  I think he's trying to just kind of have something interesting to say.  Dick Morris is a dick.  But he is still staying in contact with Bill Clinton, and he said because of Obama's numbers 
[03:17:00]  are so bad, he did say that the news media that was for Clinton will end up, that was  for Obama, will turn against Obama, and Hillary will step in because the Democrats have done  what they wanted.  They put a black in there.  Now, with Hillary, they'll put a woman in there.  A woman.  Now, what would be the harm if they had Hillary running as VP?  Like, if you have Biden step aside...  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Can I think...  Now, let me ask you a question. 
[03:17:30]  Isn't Biden...  His foreign policy strength was one of the reasons he was a good vice presidential choice?  And Obama's domestic policy hasn't been great, but his foreign policy's been great.  At the very least, he's got to get another vice president, I'm thinking.  I'm telling you, though, he's been the best part of it.  The reason I brought this up today, it seems like this is becoming something that might  be a possibility.  You got to...  Especially with the Chris Matthews thing.  Yeah.  It will happen.  You watch my words.  You watch my words.  No, I don't think so, sir.  A woman. 
[03:18:00]  A woman.  All right.  Thank you, Howard.  We got to go, brother.  I think Howard's mistaken, though, even though I know why he's saying that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know if the Democrats would do something.  It's so admitting defeat or so self-destructive to the party.  It looks like no matter what was done in those four years, it was all shit because we  have to throw this guy out of here.  And everyone that voted for Obama that's now against...  It almost is too self-destructive.  The risk of losing the election is more.  It's less. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  The whole cries of racism will be crazy.  I want to see him win again.  He's becoming a bust.  Yeah, yeah.  I want him to win again.  I really do.  You know who I want for president?  President Argentium.  Imagine that.  President Argentium.  That's nice.  What party?  Oh, my God.  The Steven Singer party.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, it's an independent.

Ah, ah, ah, ah.  I think we did it for today.  Oh, yeah.  Tomorrow's Friday.  Yeah.  Tomorrow's fucking Friday already.  This is awesome.  It's actually Tuesday.  That a boy, Sam.  It feels like Friday.  It certainly feels like Friday.  And that's what makes Wednesday so much fun.  This was a great Thursday. 
[03:20:30]  Monday.  You're not going to win that one, Sam.  You haven't worked hard for a living yet.  Wednesday is Sunday at Carvel.  By the way, I was a child of the 80s when Mr. Kennedy made that speech.  As a 1980 Democratic National Convention.  You were a young adult in the late 70s.  That started my childhood.  1980 started my childhood.  Child of the 80s.  Hence, child of the 80s.  Right here, Sam.  Who'd you vote for?  I didn't vote.  Why not?  I was too young to vote.  Oh. 
[03:21:00]  I need your post.  You were trying to trick me, but I could do the math.  I was too young to vote.  And you want to do this now or later?  You do it.  You do it.  By the way, I didn't mention the paper.  Ant's Chick has, I forgot to mention it, that spread.  We kind of touched on it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's called The Pulse in The Post.  And she's not only on the cover, she's inside the, there's like six pictures, fucking seven  pictures of Ant's girlfriend.  Yeah, she's all, it's a Christmas little fashion thing that they did in Pulse. 
[03:21:30]  And yeah, she's all gussied up for, for the holidays.  Looking very, very good there.  Yeah, it really, it really makes you want to, it makes you want to work hard and have  a gigantic mansion, because those are the benefits, the fucking model they put in the  post.  And I was riffing before, I go, what is she doing here?  What's in the box?  What has she got, like a bunch of cookies or something?  Oh, that's a good one, Chip.  And then she's sitting in front of a tree, and I'm like, what is she waiting for, Easter?  No, it's Christmas. 
[03:22:00]  And she's putting a letter for Santa mail.  I'm like, what is she asking for, like, snow cones?  I don't know.  That's a good one.  What do you mean, I don't know?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Hey, what's she got there in the bowl?  She's standing with the red shirt.  What is she making?  That looks like the thing that catches the snow from before.  No, no, that's, it's probably a bowl of, maybe some kind of soup.  Oh.  My mother made terrible onion soup.  Did she?  Yeah.  What was terrible about it? 
[03:22:30]  It's just onions and water.  That doesn't matter.  It's not like balls.  Who wants this?  Who wants this?  Oh, God.  Jimmy, you want it?  You want to take it?  Who wants this?  Do it.  All right, give me it.  What?  Ant can do it.  Good for you, Ant.  Hey, girls.  You ever wonder what it would be like to dance at a strip club, hmm?
