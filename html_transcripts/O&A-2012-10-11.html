<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a deep dive into the dramatic Yankees-Orioles baseball game, focusing on Raul Ibanez's late-inning home runs.  Producer Travis, a distraught Orioles fan, recounted his emotional devastation, while the hosts dissected Ibanez's performance and criticized the announcers' self-promotional interruptions during key moments.  Audio clips from the game were played. This was followed by an interview with Matt, the creator of the viral "Stone Cold E.T." video, a comedic White Castle drive-thru impression.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Hulk Hogan's sex tape scandal, referencing an interview Sam Roberts conducted with Hogan about the emotional fallout and betrayal from his friend, Bubba. Audio clips from both the baseball game and Sam's Hogan interview were played.  Upcoming guests were teased: Kevin Smith, Christopher Lloyd, and Kirk Hammett.

The show continued with a discussion about the upcoming KISS town hall event, fueled by Anthony's lingering resentment towards Gene Simmons.  He contrasted this with a positive memory of seeing KISS at the Ed Sullivan Theater. The hosts debated the merits of the current KISS lineup versus the original, and touched upon KISS's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination.  The conversation then shifted to the upcoming Vice-Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, with predictions and analysis of their potential performance, and a critique of Obama's performance in a previous debate using a Diane Sawyer interview clip.  A significant portion was dedicated to the Lohan family drama, specifically a leaked phone call between Lindsay and her father, Michael, revealing accusations of theft, drug use, and threats. The hosts shared their opinions on the family's behavior.  Finally, the segment previewed the upcoming in-studio appearances of Christopher Lloyd and Kevin Smith, speculating on possible interview topics and Lloyd’s most recognizable role.

The next segment started with a chaotic discussion about a technical mishap involving a Nirvana song, highlighting a disagreement between board operator Sal and Eric over song selection instructions.  Other staff members, including an intern, offered conflicting accounts, leading to humorous insults directed at Sal.  Kevin Smith then joined the show.  Their conversation covered Smith's career, his missed opportunity to have Jon Stewart on the show, and the Lance Armstrong doping scandal, including Armstrong's denial and eventual confession.  The conversation veered into nostalgic discussion of older television shows like *Quincy, M.E.*, *Cannon*, and *Hawaii Five-0*, filled with humorous, often offensive, comments and anecdotes. A listener's phone call about Kevin Smith's most valuable comic book led to a discussion about his collecting habits and bronze sculptures. The segment concluded with a brief discussion of upcoming appearances at New York Comic Con.


The penultimate segment opened with Opie and Anthony sharing anecdotes about encounters with basketball legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Julius "Dr. J" Erving, highlighting observations about Dr. J's attire and his wife's apparent lack of awareness of his career.  The conversation then shifted to Opie's dislike of cyclists and humorous childhood biking mishaps. Opie recounted a bizarre encounter with a stalker who turned out to be a fan.  The majority of the segment featured an interview with Christopher Lloyd. They discussed his career, his most famous roles (Doc Brown vs. Mr. Tabor), filming *Back to the Future* (including anecdotes about filming on a real steam locomotive and the Libyans' reactions to their portrayal), and his time on *Taxi*, including creating Reverend Jim's look and working with Andy Kaufman (described as "sane" but with a unique approach).  Lloyd also shared details about a house fire and rebuilding process.  Kirk Hammett joined the show later, promoting his new book, *Too Much Horror Business*, which showcased his horror memorabilia collection. The unexpected arrival of Paul Stanley from KISS created a surreal moment of disbelief and excitement.

The final segment focused on Kirk Hammett's horror movie memorabilia collection, detailed discussions of his collecting methods, and the preservation of his fragile items. Hammett described the sensory overload of his home, covered in his collection (to the point of only a curved wall remaining bare). The segment included humorous comments about his collecting, alternative movie art, and reinterpretations of classic films.  Gene Simmons’ surprise appearance was a major highlight,  resulting in banter, obscenities, and a photo opportunity with Hammett.  Simmons promoted his book, and Hammett shared memories of meeting Ozzy Osbourne and other music icons.  The segment ended with promotional details for Hammett's book signings and his upcoming appearance on another show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, let's do that!  Busy day on the Oakland Anthony Show.  Yeah, bruh!  Hi, everybody!  Thank you, Travis.  I'm a little bleary-eyed this morning.  How you doing?  Travis is not happy yet.  Oh, poor Travis.  Travis is very sad today.  He really is sad.  I've never seen Travis look like this.  No, Travis is very, very sad today.  I've never seen...  I woke up so depressed. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, Travis, yes.  You've never seen me this depressed.  I didn't even rub it in or anything when I came in today.  I was just like, nothing.  I've never seen Travis like this.  It's good that I'm here, because if I was just sitting at home, I would just stew in...  Well, for the people, Travis is a big Orioles fan.  Huge!  And I've never seen Travis sad in all these years working with you.  Never.  He is very depressed.  That was tough.  I thought of you last night because...  Thanks.  Well, I know, too.  I didn't see the last home run, because, you know, sometimes you have things scheduled. 
[00:01:00]  But I did...  It was very late.  What could you possibly have scheduled?  Well, you know, meetings.  But I did see the 9 o'clock one.  I'm sorry, the 9th inning one?  Yeah.  And I thought of you.  I'm like, how much do you hate the fact that it's the same guy?  Yeah.  Everyone has that player.  I don't care who it was.  Or just that the team blew it.  Whatever.  It's just an awful feeling.  It's three outs away, and then, you know, you just get fucking tooled.  Two outs away.  Two outs, actually.  Yeah.  The 9th inning, one out, one out of the 9th.  Yeah.  I mean, like, when you come into the 9th inning... 
[00:01:30]  I saw it, Danny.  You don't have to show me the newspaper.  I just had to pull the fucking audio.  Oh.  Yeah.  Then we had Travis pull the home run call.  Yeah, that was insensitive.  We made it pull the home run audio.  Well, there's some Yankee fans in the studio and some Orioles fans.  Well, one Orioles fan.  Raul Ibanez.  What a great move.  Great, but you gotta fucking love when a manager actually does what everybody's thinking.  Get fucking A-Rod out of there.  Yeah, Girardi pinch hits, huh?  Yep.  He throws in Raul Ibanez, who fucking ties up the game. 
[00:02:00]  Who, by the way, started...  Puts it into extra innings.  I was reading an article on him today.  He started his baseball career with A-Rod.  Oh, well.  And A-Rod was the chosen one.  Ah, yes.  And Ibanez was the one that had to kind of grind out a baseball career.  Yeah.  And then the article said, and finally last night, Ibanez overtakes A-Rod after all these  years.  Yes.  Just fucking a solo home run.  Gets the fucking...  One pitch, right?  One pitch.  I got the one pitch.  Gets the fucking game into extra innings. 
[00:02:30]  Well, let's go with the one pitch first.  Yes, let's hear that one.  And here's the 1-0.  Swung on and line to right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  Raul Ibanez.  Raul, be seeing you in the right field seats.  Raul, so cool.  He drills a home run over the auxiliary scoreboard into the seats.  Raul Ibanez and the Yankees, two outs away from a loss, have tied the game at two. 
[00:03:00]  Raul Ibanez.  Raul, what a fuckhead.  What a fuckhead.  What a fuckhead.  What a fuckhead.  He doesn't even finish the call before he shoehorns his shit.  It's not about you.  It's not about you.  It's a playoff game.  The guy ties it in the ninth on the first pitch with a home run and you make it about you?  Shut the fuck up.  What an OCD asshole this guy is.  Raul, so cool. 
[00:03:30]  Before he tells you that the game is tied.  Right, yes.  Fucking shut up.  It really is OCD.  It's OCD.  He has to get it in there.  Full around with that shit when it's May and the game doesn't count.  Not the fucking playoffs.  Like a month ago when they went to commercial and then they came back and he had forgotten to say back to back.  And he had to do it after the commercial.  It's definitely OCD.  It's OCD.  But again, it's the same selfishness.  It's like just stop making us fucking suffer.  Whisper it into a napkin. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Just say it into a fucking cup.  I saw the TV call this morning as we're preparing and it was just a nice home run call.  It was nice.  You had the excitement and all that, but no of that nonsense.  So that tied it up in the ninth.  And you were at the game, right?  Yes, I was.  With Roland.  Did Roland see the game?  With Roland.  Yes.  Did you take Roland or did you guys go separately?  Thanks to the lovely Debbie, we just had a great time.  And with the legends, the dining room, and then the game. 
[00:04:30]  From Roland's photos, I just get the sense that he's just walking around taking pictures.  Yeah.  Because they're from all different angles.  I won't point.  He's right behind the plate.  Yeah.  Roland was walking around a lot.  He just walks around and takes pictures.  I'd look at his seat and there's no one there.  I'm like, I wonder where Roland went.  He's got a horrendous picture with Paul Simon.  I saw it.  It's terrible.  I don't know what the fuck.  You could tell Paul Simon was annoyed.  Someone said they should call him fucking Bill's Paul Simon. 
[00:05:00]  But you know he just annoyed Paul Simon.  Had to have just annoyed the shit out of himself.  Man, I've heard things about Paul Simon.  Look at Paul Simon.  Paul Simon's like, let's just do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why is Roland so serious in the picture, too?  I don't know.  Is that Paul Simon's energy?  He probably senses the hatred.  Yes.  Yes.  Wow.  What's wrong with Paul Simon?  I don't know.  He looked really weird.  Besides the fact he didn't want to take that picture.  Yeah.  I'll bet you Paul Simon said something to him right before the flash went off and he frowned. 
[00:05:30]  You look like the guard from Midnight Express.  Frown.  Yeah, so Roland's hilarious, though.  Anyway, he's just making noises and yelling and people are turning around and looking at him.  Noises.  Yes.  Roland is in his own world.  It was funny.  He's fun to go to events with, but he's in his own little world.  He really is.  And then when the big wind came in, Roland just like goofs on everything. 
[00:06:00]  He's high-fiving people, you know, turning around and putting his hands up to high-five  people and intentionally missing.  Just being Roland.  It's hilarious.  So Ibanez.  Ibanez.  Ninth inning ties it up with one pitch.  Yes, yes.  As a pinch hitter for A-Rod.  That's beautiful.  For A-Rod.  Just get fucking...  When I saw A-Rod...  For the A-Rod haters, that's beautiful.  When I saw A-Rod's dumb name come off the fucking lineup there...  Did the stadium go nuts?  Yeah.  Everybody fucking was just like, thank God. 
[00:06:30]  He's fucking out of there.  I was reading in the paper today.  There's rumors.  He might be out of that fucking lineup.  He should be.  He can't hit righties right now.  This is playoff fucking baseball.  The guy has no place in there if he can't fucking perform.  He was...  Dude, he would get up to bat and everyone gets up to piss.  The bathrooms would get full the second he got up.  No.  Yes.  Wow, that's weird.  Yes.  That's really weird.  It was because everyone knew he just stinks. 
[00:07:00]  It's just that obvious?  It got to the point where it was that fucking obvious.  Where it's like, this guy is not going to do anything.  And supposedly he's going to be yanked from the lineup.  That's what they're hinting at on the sports pages.  Well, if anyone could have driven it home last night, it was Ibanez.  Because then in extra innings, he gets up there and fucking does it again.  Travis is not happy.  Oh, man.  It's so weird to see Travis like that.  Well, it was in the 12th inning.  You really like your Orioles, huh? 
[00:07:30]  He loves the Orioles.  I can't...  How long have you been in Orioles?  I was born.  Oh, my God.  I can't explain to you how much of my life I've put into this piece of shit team.  For the most part.  They're not a piece of shit team.  They were.  They're in it.  For 15 years.  Oh, okay.  Since I was 16 years old, they have sucked.  And you still were a fan?  And I watched.  This is like that old school passion for a sports team. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, it really is.  It hurts because they had the 2-1 lead the night.  If they lost 7-1, you'd be better today.  When he tied it in the ninth, all I was thinking was, how much time am I going to waste now before they lose?  Oh, no.  Because I've watched this game a thousand times.  The stupid Yankees ninth inning magic.  I know how it ends.  I know how it ends.  Yeah.  If they lose tonight, it won't be half as bad as last night.  Wow.  I've already watched the worst game of the year.  It's harder on the road because you've got the last ups.  I mean, it's harder for a road team to pull off extra inning lifts. 
[00:08:30]  Well, then we got you.  I didn't even see the last home run.  I didn't either.  Oh, really?  It went off his bat.  I've got the remote in my hand.  Oh, you're one of those guys?  I've done that, too.  I can't do that.  I have to, like, suffer.  No.  You're one of those guys.  As soon as you know, you just click it off.  Oh, my God.  The second he hit that ball.  No kidding.  Poor Lisa's got a big black eye.  Is the kid okay today?  Yeah.  Kid's all right.  Kid's safe.  The dog's got a fucking broken leg.  He's jumping around.  Riley's just crying because Daddy was yelling. 
[00:09:00]  Mama, birds do bad.  She doesn't know what they are.  Birds do bad.  She's three.  She's not retarded.  I know.  But she's just too scared to say the word Oriole.  So she says, that's the code word they use.  How's the birds?  Is there a lot of sweeping up going on at your house right now?  No.  There's no yelling.  There's no...  You have to.  So the second it went off his bat, you just clicked off?  Click.  I was already in bed.  Oh, crap.  How long did it take you to fall asleep?  Terrible.  Five minutes.  Oh, you're okay.  But the reason I don't click off in those situations, my mind starts fucking with me and 
[00:09:30]  I go, maybe it was an illegal bat.  Maybe it was an illegal bat and they have...  The bat's corked.  And they're going to call it back.  Pine tar.  Yeah, maybe they're going to check the pine tar.  I can never click off.  I have to suffer.  My wife's been away.  This was the first night that she's seen me watching one of these games.  Oh, no.  And I'm just sitting there.  I'm just nervously, you know, tapping my leg.  She's like, hey, nervous.  Stop it.  Bad or later.  I'm like, this is why.  Oh, no. 
[00:10:00]  This is why.  You think it's in the bag.  It's never.  She jinxed it.  Yeah, she did.  I want her to go back up to Montreal so I can watch more baseball by myself.  Well, I'll tell you, me being at the game is key.  And this is why I didn't go.  This is why I won't go.  Oh, my God.  I've got a chance to go tonight.  You have to.  No.  You've got to go.  No.  No.  I don't want to be there.  You've got to mix this shit up.  No.  That fucking...  No.  That would have depressed the shit out of you.  That crowd.  I don't want to be there for that.  When that fucking ball, right when it went off his bat, that place went fucking bullshit. 
[00:10:30]  Really?  What is the surprise?  It's so...  I know, right?  It's so cool to be there when shit like that happens.  It's just...  It's so loud.  Everyone's just...  Well, let's get to that.  It's such a good time.  It's great.  I want to hear the TV and the radio one.  Can we hear the different calls?  Can you find the TV real fast?  Yeah, the TV one will be on.  What time was the 12th inning, by the way?  This was a fast game.  This was like...  I saw the first four or five innings and then I was done. 
[00:11:00]  Was it 11-something?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, not bad.  No, it was a very fast game.  It wasn't bad.  And it was against a lefty or was it a righty?  I'm sorry.  It was a lefty.  Wow, lefty, lefty.  Good.  We were sitting, waiting for a lot of people to leave.  So we just sat in our seats and people were filing out.  And I was just sitting there.  I was right on one of the aisles.  Everybody's packed out.  And I was just really seriously saying, you know, you just don't pull A-Rod.  You don't fucking do that.  I go, there's confidence there's going to be...  And people were looking down at me like, are you a fucking idiot? 
[00:11:30]  Their faces were hilarious.  I guess...  You got to tape that shit.  Yeah.  I just thought it was funny to do.  That's my mantra.  Tape that shit.  It was really fucking funny.  It's like, you don't pull A-Rod.  Major League Baseball knows where it's at.  Samsung Galaxy S3, baby.  They know where their sponsors are at.  Yeah.  Boy.  They just want to show the world that they know what the best phone is.  Oh, boy.  Which one do you want?  Do the TV one first.  Yeah, TV one.  I like this home run call. 
[00:12:00]  It was perfect.  The announcers are great.  Here he goes.  Since being in the bullpen.  Did he do it again?  He did!  Oh, my God.  That's all you need.  He did.  No, because then you just watch Rebanias going around the bases, coming home to a giant  celebratory Yankee crowd at the plate. 
[00:12:30]  The announcer becomes a fan at that point.  Yeah.  You know, it's not about you.  You become a fan and go, oh, my God, did he just do it again?  It's pretty much what anyone's thinking.  Yeah.  And then you got John Sterling, the same exact home run call.  He pinched it for A-Rod in the ninth, and in a tying home run, three infielders on the  right side.  Lefty to lefty.  Mattis, Neal, swung on, and driven a deep right.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  Raul Abanias has put on...  All right. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to stop this.  I'm going to stop this like we do every John Sterling call.  And throw away the disc.  Well, no.  This is where it should end.  It is gone.  He's done it again.  There you go.  All right.  There you fucking go.  John, what a great call.  What a great call, John.  Very exciting.  He'll say Raul Abanias has done...  He'll give more facts, which makes sense.  I think there's more goodness from John Sterling before he destroys it with his cunt OCD.  And he doesn't...  You know, the it is high, it is whatever.  He doesn't even need that every fucking time. 
[00:13:30]  Especially with these big home runs.  That was a good home run call to that point.  He still has 19 seconds left in his home run call.  Oh, no.  Raul Abanias has put on one of the great playoff displays of hitting.  He drills one in the right field seats to win the game.  That's right.  Raul, so cool.  Ball game over.  Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  In that home run call, he has to get three of his catchphrases in. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It is high.  That's the one.  Then the nickname for the home run or the guy.  And then, you know, how the Yankees win.  Sure.  He has to say it that way every single fucking time.  Because that's more important than the actual event is his telling of it.  It's like Al Michael saying, do you believe in miracles every single time he fucking announces a sporting event.  Just working it in even though it doesn't work.  It doesn't.  It's not the same as when he first said it.  I mean, if you hear this every once in a while, it would be kind of cool. 
[00:14:30]  I'm not going to lie to you.  It's a little different.  It would be kind of cool.  But when you do it every time, you want to talk about catchphrases.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Place went nuts, though, huh?  Oh, God.  It's just one of those things where everybody.  The crowd at one point, I mean, they were completely out of the game.  How are you out of the game?  They were out of the game for most of that night.  I know.  Yeah.  That's why.  I was sitting around.  I'm just looking around going, wow, this crowd is just fucking nothing going on. 
[00:15:00]  And it was a close game.  So, yeah, but it was a lot of just, you know.  Pitcher's duel for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People don't like that, huh?  They don't like the pitcher's duel.  I love it.  It was, and it was pretty much just home run balls.  It wasn't really, you know, there wasn't really a lot of action going on around the bases.  So, most of the game was just spent watching a pitcher fucking pitch.  It was all home runs except for Jeter's triple.  Was Jeter all right?  I heard he got fouled off the court. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, he's going to play tonight, but he's not.  You don't think he's 100%?  No.  He fouled him off his foot?  Yeah.  Badly.  Yeah.  He got pulled, but I don't know.  I was kind of thinking he got pulled so as not to make A-Rod feel so bad.  We're going to pull both of you.  It's like, yeah, yeah.  We're going to, why don't you both sit in the dugout for a little while and chit-chat?  Jeter, who tripled and then hurt himself, you, who have been swatting flies, you fucking juicy-lipped twat.  Juicy-lipped.  He's got those big juicy lips. 
[00:16:00]  I almost felt bad for him at one point last night.  How do you feel bad for a guy that makes that much money?  For that reason, I don't.  But there was one, they showed one of the strikeouts, and he just, you could, and he  makes his-  When it was a called strike?  Oh, he was.  Oh, you mean he finally showed some emotions?  It was an older one from, like, over the series, and he's walking away like, and you  can see he doesn't want to freak out in front of everybody, but these guys are all ego.  Oh, that's frustrating.  This is destroy- if there's any consolation to A-Rod haters, we hate him, he really hates 
[00:16:30]  himself.  Because you do care because it's humiliating.  It's humiliating.  And then to have that happen last night is even worse, because now it's like, oh, so  some guy could just come in for me and fucking knock two home runs in?  Well, with that said, what they were saying this morning, he became a cheerleader, A-Rod,  and he was the first to congratulate him on the top step of the dugout.  Yeah.  A-Rod is just fucking playing that role.  He fucking hates that this went down.  Yeah.  You don't want this to go down.  You should never have to pinch hit for a half a billionaire. 
[00:17:00]  Never.  Never.  Right.  It's crazy.  Never.  And he hit it off a lefty.  The final home run was off a lefty.  Yeah, lefty-lefty.  Yeah, that was just, but I'll tell you, he's probably happy the guy did it or someone  did it, because it's better to him have a dogshit series and they win than a dogshit  series.  And the whole story is how much he stinks.  Anyone who helps win that game, he's probably like, thank God, they're not thinking about  me right now.  But if they don't win the World Series, it's going to be the same scenario you just described.  Yeah, the whole offseason.  Yeah, they have to win the whole thing to cover up his horrendous performance. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  You guys want to talk to Stone Cold E.T.?  Yes.  Of course.  We're finding these internet stars.  Stone Cold E.T.  What's going on?  What's up, man?  It fucking rolls.  I don't know how, but we stumbled upon your video and we've been fucking laughing our balls  off the last few days.  Well, let's say this. 
[00:18:00]  Look at all Schwarzenegger, look in his video eyes and whooping his ass. 
[00:18:30]  Look at that, brother.  Can I ask...  Oh, my God, get me a while here, because he's going to whoop my ass.  Stone Cold E.T., can I ask what you normally order from White Castle?  That was an odd culinary choice.  Yeah.  Well, Stone Cold E.T. like to order a little half meal.  I like getting those little toys.  I like playing with them.  I like their little drinks.  I like having meals. 
[00:19:00]  Plain and simple.  And if you don't like that, I got to go there, open a cat, a whoop bass, and walk and drive.  Don't forget about the onions.  So bonnie.  Stone Cold E.T., it looked very hard to drive.  It looked like you really had to look down at your gear shift.  Yeah, where they told you to pull up to the next window.  Oh, you think it's really hard for Stone Cold Steve Austin to drive? 
[00:19:30]  You think it's really hard?  I got two big eyes.  It's kind of easy for Stone Cold E.T. to drive and whoop some ass at the same time.  Give me hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Steve Austin is back.  Stone Cold E.T. is back.  I don't know how this video is not up to in the millions at this point. 
[00:20:00]  It's just, it's hilarious.  We know the shit.  This one will be in the millions.  It's fucking hilarious.  People will find Stone Cold E.T., the hilarious drive-thru thing.  Each time I talk Stone Cold E.T., you got these people taking Stone Cold E.T.'s video and downloading it.  And a lot of people keep trying to steal my video.  You know what?  Stone Cold E.T. has a message for all those people.  I'm going to go to each of your one of your houses and stomp a mud hole and walk his ride. 
[00:20:30]  After the bomb ride, we got Stone Cold E.T. sent so.  Stone Cold E.T. is very angry.  People stealing his videos.  He's very passionate about his videos.  Yes.  I am furious.  I don't wait.  The Texas whale snake is still...  I can't.  I just want to whoop some ass. 
[00:21:00]  I love Stone Cold E.T.  Oh, shit.  Fucking...  This guy is Matt.  He does Stone Cold E.T.  We fucking love it, Matt.  You should do other videos of Stone Cold E.T.  It's a very funny character.  Yeah, absolutely.  What's that fucking pothead?  Are you a pothead?  Not really.  Not really.  What do you do for a living, Matt?  Well, I currently work in the city doing maintenance work, but once in the blue moon, I do stand-up, 
[00:21:30]  and that has been a huge part of my life.  You should do...  It's a really funny video, and to have it pop up in weird, different places like that,  that was perfect, the way you shot that.  It was the perfect length, you know, two or three minutes, and it's very funny, man.  Yeah.  You say you work in the city.  What city?  Chicago.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, we were just up there.  Yeah, the whole Stone Cold E.T. video, actually, it was kind of shocked, because, you know, 
[00:22:00]  like, I do impressions, but, like, no one watches impression videos, so I was like, hey,  let's have Stone Cold.  They own so many Halloween masks and stuff like that.  Had an E.T. mask and decided to do it.  I didn't expect the video to get, like, so many views and publicity and different websites.  It's just so fucking ridiculous, that's hilarious.  No, you nailed it, man.  The combination makes no sense whatsoever.  Yeah, and it's the angle from the side. 
[00:22:30]  It's, like, sitting next to this fucking odd creature.  Do you see you do Stone Cold on stage?  Oh, yeah, I do, actually.  Like, that's actually one of the first impressions that I actually knew how to do.  Like, I remember I was, like, seven years old, and my dad bought me a voice recorder.  I used to watch a lot of wrestling, so I used to record his voice and play it back in a cassette tape  and kind of, like, you know, imitate that.  And ever since I was little, I used to sound like Stone Cold. 
[00:23:00]  You know, it's weird, like, a wrestling one, like, that's specific.  Like, half the audience probably gets it, the other half doesn't know who he is because they're not wrestling fans.  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too, you know.  Like, some sites, I was reading some of the comments, a lot of people were like,  oh, a lot of people didn't think it was funny.  But, like, the people actually know who Stone Cold people are.  I guess the real Stone Cold actually put it on his Twitter.  Oh, really?  Oh, he did? Okay.  I don't know how many times I just said Stone Cold.  You know, probably so many times already. 
[00:23:30]  I've been at a quarter each time.  I also saw you're doing a pretty good Ultimate Warrior.  Who else do you do?  You name them, I could probably do it.  Like, all the main impressions I could probably do, but a lot of people just keep on with more and more wrestling ones.  Yeah.  Do you do Bob Backlund?  Bob Backlund.  Bob Backlund?  Yeah.  I remember Bob Backlund.  I think he has a rappy voice, like,  My name is Bob...  That sounds like Leone Orange. 
[00:24:00]  That's what I mean, that sounds like Bobo.  Yeah, yeah.  Even Dick the Snake, you know.  Who made the DDT?  Who is the man?  Sam's making a face.  You do a macho man?  Oh, yeah.  Don't you do a swing, Jimmy?  You see the macho man?  Wound on the tap roof.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's a very good macho man.  Virg. 
[00:24:30]  Yes, it is.  Based on those impressions, you should definitely do more Stone Cold E.T. videos.  Whoa, Sam.  What's the matter with you, Sam?  I said Stone Cold E.T. was funny.  Yeah, it is.  Why are you blowing out his candle to make yours brighter today?  I'm the one who brought Stone Cold E.T. to the show.  Why don't you just make fucking Hulk Hogan cry again, you fucking bastard.  Yeah, one of our guys might have made Hulk Hogan cry yesterday.  He was watery.  He got a little pissy-eyed.  Yeah, we're going to get to the...  Hulk got a little pissy-eyed yesterday with Sam.  We're going to get to the audio in a minute or so.  Where did you see him? 
[00:25:00]  Right here.  He's here.  In the afternoon.  Paul was in trouble recently, right?  With a porn video?  What's that?  Yeah, he was...  He made a fuck tape.  Yeah.  He made a fuck tape.  Fuck tape.  He has a big thermos cock.  He's depressed about it for some reason.  You do Hulk Hogan?  The thing is, I actually saw Vito Ultimate Warrior, and he was like...  He was talking, he was like...  Hulk Hogan used to go to me, and he wants to swing and give his wife to me.  He was talking like that.  I was like, what?  Like Hogan, a swinger? 
[00:25:30]  But...  Yeah, he was...  We listened to a clip where he was talking about fucking Hulk's wife.  Yeah.  And apparently Hulk fucks other people's wives.  Yeah.  Wrestling rules.  Works out.  Works out.  Yeah.  That's it.  It's a weird world those guys are living in.  It certainly is.  Well, Stone Cold E.T., very funny video.  Matt, we're big fans, man.  You got any gigs in Chicago you want to plug?  Um, I would, but I don't have to make gigs right now.  Oh.  Got to get out there. 
[00:26:00]  CM Punk also tweeted about watching Stone Cold E.T.  Oh, really?  Like a Chicago native.  Oh, CM Punk also tweeted it there.  Yeah.  Wow.  Pretty goddamn cool.  You watch those views go up.  They're going to go up.  Big time.  Yeah.  It's up to 331,000.  Matt.  Again, like, I made so many drive-thru videos because, like, a lot of people just really  don't watch impression videos.  So, I was like, hey, let me just show up my impressions and do something, you know,  kind of, like, unique.  Original.  Very smart.  Original and different.  Very good.  Hey, take us a... 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  There's going to be a new video.  Uh, Hulk Hogan T-Rex.  T-Rex mask and Hulk Hogan.  T-Rex mask and Hulk Hogan.  See, that's perfect.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Yeah, we'll, uh, we'll look out for that.  T-Rex.  Hey, Matt, take us out with some Stone Cold E.T., please.  All right, one more time.  This is Stone Cold E.T., and if you don't get the message, I want you to call the next  Jupiter, the next planet, because I'm coming back to whoop some ass. 
[00:27:00]  Give me all hell yeah if you're down with Stone Cold E.T., all hell yeah!  Thank you.  Stone Cold E.T.  Thank you, Stone Cold E.T.  Thank you, Matt.  Good luck to you, brother.  Stone Cold E.T.  Here you go, Stone Cold E.T.  Ridiculous.  So fucking ridiculous.  He's very soft-spoken when he's not Stone Cold E.T.  He's a shy boy.  Yes, yes.  He does Stone Cold really well, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't think the Warrior was that bad. 
[00:27:30]  No.  Sometimes it's hard on the phone.  Yeah.  And Macho Man wasn't that bad, was it?  But when you've heard really good Macho Man impressions.  Who does a great Macho Man?  Dan Soder.  Yeah.  Dan does amazing ones.  Oh, Dan does really good impressions.  Dan Soder does a great Macho Man.  That's right.  He did that when he was in, right?  An amazing Macho Man.  Yeah.  So there you go.  Stone Cold E.T.  Stone Cold E.T.  But all the wrestlers are tweeting the video?  That's funny.  Yeah, CM Punk tweeted something about watching it in the parking lot with a bunch of the other  wrestlers or something.  Did he fucking tweet the link for the kid? 
[00:28:00]  I don't remember.  Because he's got a lot of followers.  Yeah, he's got over a million.  All you gotta do is just look up Stone Cold E.T.  You're not gonna find many different things.  No, no.  No.  What did you talk to Hulk about?  You got him in the afternoon?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I talked to him.  I mean, I talked to him about the sex tape.  Oh, Brett.  I brought it in clips.  Oh, wow.  But now he looked at you like a little Hulkamaniac.  Well, I did.  I let him know that I'm...  Because I am a Hulkamaniac.  Oh, boy.  And all I was thinking, though, is how jealous E-Rock must have been. 
[00:28:30]  While he was holding the video camera for me?  Yes.  And you're just fucking bonding...  Where were you?  ...with one of his big heroes.  I showed him to start the interview...  Because I wanted Hogan to know he was in a safe place.  Uh-huh.  So I started the interview.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, God.  I started the interview...  Diane Sawyer over here.  Exactly.  ...by showing him a photo of me dressed as him when I was in second grade.  See?  Did that beer can dick jump up?  Foster's can cock. 
[00:29:00]  How do we know he's got a beer can dick?  Because I think it said in the thing, and you can see when he turns around...  Yeah.  It's an overhead fucking dimly lit room hidden camera, and his cock is still the star of  the show.  Yeah.  Gawker cited it as being thermos-like.  Thermos-like.  Thermos-like.  Jesus.  Gawker.  All right.  Here's Sam talking to Hulk Hogan.  All of a sudden, the pendulum started swinging back the other way.  Oh, hey, no way.  Yes.  Boo.  Yes.  I want to drink out of the thermos. 
[00:29:30]  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, no way did he say that.  Yes.  What are you doing, Hulkster?  You're ripping me off.  Hoo-hoo.  Are you wearing lame Bryant?  I'm going to haunt your cock with my mouth.  Boo.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh, ghostly Steve.  Oh.  Oh, Steve.  Oh.  So that's your picture? 
[00:30:00]  Let me see.  Was that the picture of you?  Let's see.  What are you showing us there, Sam?  I don't know where it went.  Oh, boy.  Look at that.  You can't even pull up your own shit on the internet.  Come on.  You can fucking find somebody else to do this.  Not.  Are you terrible?  It's Stone Cold E.T. here.  There you are.  Ah.  Let me see that.  Oh, my God.  Look at you.  My kid will never dress as a...  What's with that douchey wig?  It's not a wig.  It's a bandana like Hulkster wears.  Ugh.  Oh, you look so cute when you...  I remember that outfit.  You always said, Uncle Paul, why is there a hole in the back?  I said, shut up. 
[00:30:30]  I don't even know what color you are.  You know what's enraging about this picture?  I know his mom made that costume for him.  Of course she did.  My mom never made me a Halloween costume.  Out of Hulk's real ass hair.  She knitted together from Hulk's ass hair.  She followed Hulk around the country for two years, collecting his ass hairs.  She posed as a laundry lady, and she'd go into his wrestling uniform and gently pluck  ass hairs for the uniform and weave them together.  You could tell she got a whole bunch of pictures of Hulk Hogan and... 
[00:31:00]  Aw.  And little Sam Roberts.  With love, she made that costume for her little Sam.  Hulk rules.  You're a cancer kid.  Yeah, you really do.  Wrists like this.  That's how you make a bicep.  Yeah, you're like this.  Yeah, yeah.  His hands are all stupidly wimpy looking.  That was actually a picture.  What they did was they just photoshopped out the cock in each one.  He was servicing two adults.  Yeah, he was servicing two larger men.  Holy shit.  That could be a really good photo. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, and they made it look like it's a mustache, but it's really not.  Oh, God.  I almost put this photo online until you said that.  Oh, man.  Let's do it.  It's adorable.  Let the guys have some fun.  Jesus Christ.  That would be so bad.  Yeah.  It's perfect.  Were you happy with the Hulk costume?  Yeah, I was psyched.  Yeah.  I thought it was great.  I wish...  Now I wish he'd packed a thermos in the front of the tights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would have been a little more accurate.  All right, let's get to the interview because we've got a really busy show today.  We've got Kevin Smith coming in.  We've got Christopher Lloyd coming in. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  Big one.  And Kirk Hammett from Metallica coming in.  Yes.  Wow.  Mr. Tabor.  Yeah.  And maybe some Jack Tober.  Yes.  Do we have the audio left from yesterday?  We should.  All right.  Now, we thought we were just doing it right now.  How dare you.  Here's Sam and Hulk Hogan.  All of a sudden, the pendulum started swinging back the other way.  All the way.  I started getting a new life and I became a better person.  I met some woman that wasn't jaded by this industry and had most nothing about this crap  that's going on.  The pendulum swung back, but it's kind of like a spinning wheel that stops and shit 
[00:32:30]  keeps flying off it for a while.  So what happened?  Shit keeps flying off the pendulum.  Well, because in the beginning, he was talking about how he's just basically setting it up  where he was in a bad place with his life, but he was finally getting into  a good place and then this shit hit the fan.  Precisely.  Off it.  Okay.  For a while.  It's karma.  It's energy.  And that stuff from your past.  Yeah, man.  And all of a sudden, just when I thought it was over, you know what?  You have to be accountable.  You have to step up.  Are you really able to do that, though? 
[00:33:00]  It seems like this is a ridiculously tough lesson for you to learn, man.  Brother, you know how much all this stuff that is so horrible and like you said, that  is so bad.  Do you know how good it really is if I survive this?  How much of a better person I'm going to be?  Because yesterday, I've been through a lot of stuff, man.  Yeah.  Federal stuff.  Just ridiculous.  Divorce.  The craziness.  The back surgeries when they told me I'd never walk again after eight back surgeries. 
[00:33:30]  And that's the same time your son's going to jail.  Yeah.  And the same time your wife is taking all this money from you and saying crazy shit in the  press.  Yeah, and she's left me.  Barbara Walters.  Living with some 18-year-old kids, just totally nuts stuff.  Right.  What this did to me yesterday, that day yesterday, and what it did to my new wife, who has no  bone in this fight.  This stuff happened for him.  It's got a thermos.  It flipped my world upside down, single-handedly the most traumatic thing that's ever happened 
[00:34:00]  to me.  Damn, man.  You're getting a good Hulk Hogan here, man.  Man.  Wow.  Why would you fight?  I'm very honest.  He liked me, too.  He asked, you can ask Eric.  He goes, at the end of the interview, he was like, how about a picture with a real Hulkamaniac?  And I was like, of course.  Oh.  And then he had me, he said, here, and he showed me how to do the collar and elbow tie-up.  Yes, you're doing a little wrestling move with him there.  Yeah.  It's on my Instagram.  Dumb face.  Yeah.  We're wrestling, Jim.  Oh, boy.  What face do you expect this to me?  Look at his face. 
[00:34:30]  He's just kind of smiling like we're just playing.  No, not me, though.  Sam's all in.  This is called forced cock sucking.  His hand is on the back of Sam's head.  I want to feel those locks.  Just trying to pull his head down.  Yeah.  Come on, brother.  Take a thermos in your mouth.  And what picture did Iroch get?  Just the standing next to Hulk, smiling?  Yeah, let's compare the picture.  Where's your picture?  Where's Iroch's Hulk picture?  Where's Iroch's Hulk picture?  I didn't get one yesterday.  Why?  Why?  He's your hero.  Iroch took a behind-the-camera stance.  Oh.  Why are you always taking one for the team? 
[00:35:00]  Why wouldn't you get a picture?  I don't have photos of Hulk already.  Oh.  Man, but not like new fucking sex tape Hulk.  I don't have that grappling photo.  No.  He was jealous.  Because it's not like he could be like, hey, Hulk, now that you asked Sam to do that,  will you also do it with me?  Yeah.  And then Hulk would be like, you're not a Hulkamaniac, brother.  Yeah.  Let's continue with the interview.  He talks about TMZ calling him.  I had to rationalize it.  Don't understand it.  And then the reason I haven't slept is...  How long has it been since you slept? 
[00:35:30]  I didn't sleep last night.  Jeez.  But as I'm trying to be cool, I get TMZ and all these people calling me, telling me that  the guy that's my best friend...  That's what I was going to ask you about.  ...is the one that did this to me.  And is that the first...  When the TMZ interview, is that the first time you're hearing about this?  So they have you on the phone?  Yeah.  And they're like, let's get an immediate reaction.  It's your best friend that's saying this.  They hit me with it on the phone.  They said, yo, you got to get on the phone right away.  I said, I'm going to get on the phone.  I'm not my attorney.  I don't know what you guys are up to.  Right.  So we got on the phone with David Houston, and they read the transcript. 
[00:36:00]  Of Bubba saying...  A guy named Mike Walters and Harvey read me the transcript that when I walked out of the  room, Bubba went up to the camera, and he said he was laughing when he walked up to the  camera, and said, ha, ha, Heather, this is our retirement if we ever need...  And they said he was laughing when he went up and turned the camera off.  And up until that point, you had been under the assumption Bubba didn't even know it was  recording.  Yeah, and he swore to me, and I said, dude, I'm getting ready to file criminal charges.  It's not about just you and me.  It's like, if you didn't do this, you're my best friend ever.  I love you to death. 
[00:36:30]  If you did this, we never were friends, but it's more than just you and me.  You've got a son, a 10-year-old son, and he's on the chopping block, too, now, the altar.  I need to know, because I may react differently, because I love your family.  I need to know, it's not just you and me.  Your son could lose a father financially, be impacted, so I need to know, and he swore to  me he didn't do it.  Jesus.  What the fuck's wrong with Bubba?  I don't know, dude.  What's wrong with that fucking guy?  Jesus.  Was he getting pissy-eyed right there?  Yeah, he started getting red-eyed and slapped.  Yeah, because he trusted this guy for years. 
[00:37:00]  You know, they were good friends, best friends, whatever, and Bubba does that?  It's fucked up.  And you know he went to his office and jerked off while the Hulk was fucking his wife.  He's probably monitoring the camera.  Yeah, you fucker.  Well, you got cameras in your house?  No, outside my house.  Oh.  I don't have them inside.  Sorry.  That's, like, creepy, I think.  But you do know how to monitor them, so obviously if he knows there's a camera in the bedroom  and he goes, well, I'll be in my office.  Oh, absolutely.  What do you think he's doing in his office?  He had to be watching. 
[00:37:30]  It's fucking creepy.  See, for Hulk Hogan, it's probably hard to find genuine friends who you know like you  and you know who are comfortable with you.  Yeah, some kind of ulterior motive.  Because he's the biggest wrestler ever.  I think he is.  Yeah, absolutely.  And to find guys that you're comfortable with and you can just be yourself with.  Yeah.  And then here's this guy.  He's his best friend and he fucked.  That would be like Bob Kelly or Voss betraying me like that or Colin.  Like, what the fuck, dude?  Oh, man.  Yeah.  It's all the time we've spent together.  Why would you do that?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Well, Hulk picks shitty friends, obviously.  And I mean, for whatever reason.  You don't know that.  It's hard when you're 20 years in, man.  It's oof.  That's, yeah, he should have fucking seen the signs.  He's got like, and as much as he's done for Bubba, even professionally, his career, like  everywhere Hogan goes, if he's not wearing a Hogan shirt, he's wearing a Bubba Army shirt.  He got Bubba on wrestling.  He got him on TNA.  I mean, they fired him because he sucked, but he at least got him the job.  What is that dope Bubba saying?  Nothing.  Not a word.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's pretty brave. 
[00:38:30]  And his radio company told the staff of his station not to mention it either.  Oh, really?  Wait, has Bubba been on the air?  Yeah.  But he hasn't said a word.  Oh, boy.  That's not too awkward.  I'll say that.  I don't think Bubba released this.  He, A, never would have left that last part in there, and B...  Well, what?  He's not with his wife anymore, right?  They're divorced.  So she obviously grabbed a copy of this, I think.  Maybe.  You think?  But still, he's on the tape saying, you know, he secretly taped his good friend.  And he told Hogan, like Hogan said, that I didn't know this was recorded. 
[00:39:00]  I didn't know the camera was on.  Maybe.  You know what?  And there is, like, the problem is...  Bubba proves that he knew the camera was on.  And it's a criminal offense, they're saying, to record, in Florida, to record somebody having  sex without their knowledge.  So Bubba, if he didn't release it, he definitely recorded them.  Yeah.  Without Hogan's knowledge.  He probably, he was probably joking when he said that.  Like, you know...  Yeah, but he still was taping his friend having sex with his wife.  Yeah, with his wife.  But he was probably just kidding when he said that, and had he released the tape, he never 
[00:39:30]  would have left that part on.  That would have been cut.  Yeah, but none of that's going to matter in the end.  Just the fact that he did it secretly, and then saved it, without telling Hulk?  Like, obviously Bubba knew he had it all this time.  He was probably just jerking off to it.  He was just jerking off to his wife getting fucked by a big dick.  I'm telling you, that's all it is.  Unless he has a thing, I don't know what Bubba's sexual thing is, but I'm going to  guess he was just jerking off to this.  Because that's what I would do if I see the chick getting fucked by a guy.  I would just jerk off watching him.  Well, this Bubba, you know, tries to act like he's a tough guy and a brave man.  Why isn't he talking about this? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Why isn't he talking about this?  I know.  This is like, finally, there's...  Final legal ramifications.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, he should say something.  But how do you go on the air every day and do that kind of show?  Because this show is like our show in the sense that you're just talking.  It's not...  Yeah.  How do you not address this?  I mean, Hogan is...  He's a public best friend.  He's been on Bubba's show hundreds of times.  Yeah, yeah.  So you continued your interview with Hulk Hogan.  Oh, yeah.  One of your heroes.  I asked Harvey.  I said, Harvey, did you see the tape?  And Harvey said, no. 
[00:40:30]  And I said, well, then I don't believe you.  And then my...  Oh, back to what?  Harvey Levin.  Yeah, he's talking about...  Sorry.  The conversation that he had with TMZ Live that we played on the show yesterday.  Right.  When Harvey told him...  Harvey!  This is what it says on the tape.  And he's saying that he had no idea that Bubba had said that on the tape until they told him on the air, this is the transcript.  We've seen it.  And once again, Bubba said something like, you know, we can retire off this.  Right.  So Hogan always thought that Bubba didn't know that it was being recorded.  I asked Harvey. 
[00:41:00]  I said, Harvey, did you see the tape?  And Harvey said, no.  And I said, well, then I don't believe you.  And then Mike Walters goes, well, I saw it all of a sudden.  Some crazy voice came on the conference line and said, Hogan, this is the executive producer of the show.  And I witnessed the tape of Mike Walters.  And I hung the phone up and I just started shaking violently.  I couldn't control it.  Like when he gets crazy and tears his shirt off.  Is that how he was shaking?  He started hulking up.  He started hulking up.  He pointed right above his picture and went, no.  Oh, man.  No.  And then he leg dropped the towers. 
[00:41:30]  Let's not forget, he did it for us, though.  He did.  He meant to.  He had good intentions.  I controlled my body.  I was like shaking and freaking out.  And my lawyer, David Houston, was calling me.  Everybody was calling me.  I thought on that spot I was going to have a heart attack.  I couldn't push my iPhone to answer it.  Finally, after about, it could have been five minutes, could have been three.  I don't know, but it seemed like about ten.  Finally, when I answered the phone, I wasn't crying, but I was going, ah, ah, I was freaking out.  And he kind of like talked me down, you know?  Yeah.  And so, dude, it was the most. 
[00:42:00]  And, you know, didn't have to tell my wife what might be.  And I still haven't seen the tape.  Right.  So, praying to God, praying to God, bro, that something crazy is happening, you know?  But that's why I was so rattled last night and today.  But, dude.  Dude.  It's the single-handedly, the heaviest thing that's ever flipped in my life, you know?  And my kids, to be old enough to, okay, Dad, we know who you are, everything's good.  Can you imagine?  My kids are like 10 and 12.  They may just listen to somebody else I used to be in love with saying, your dad says, your dad's that. 
[00:42:30]  That's right.  When you're talking about his kids, too, that's where he's got a real watery eye.  Now, Barbara Walters would have seen that and then just started to keep talking about the kids.  Yeah, yeah, you've got to get them to cry at this point.  And get them to fucking cry.  Yeah.  That's where you've got to cry.  And you've got to lower your voice, too.  Smell blood.  I'll tell you, when she did an Ozzy-Sharon interview and she got Ozzy crying because  it was after Sharon announced her cancer, Barbara Walters is fucking good.  She knows how to get people weeping.  She knows how to give you enough space to kind of walk around and then she knows when 
[00:43:00]  to step in.  It's hard, isn't it?  It's fucking good.  Yes, it is.  It is.  It's hard.  Yeah.  You're scared, aren't you?  I certainly am.  But it doesn't even matter what you're talking about.  If she asked me what time did you get to work, I would just, well, you know, I walked in  like five after six.  You wanted to get there earlier.  Yeah, I did.  That's right.  But the fucking cat brought the light. 
[00:43:30]  He fucking cut over the list.  Oh, shit.  I wish I had, like, real time with him.  I had 20 minutes with him.  Oh, stop.  You did a good job.  That's good, man.  Stop beating yourself up.  We spent the first 10 minutes.  He was talking about drinking Crown Royale with Andre the Giant.  Really?  Yeah.  I think we just lost our CD player, though.  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Did you ask him about Destroying the Towers?  No, I didn't.  See, these are all things I would have loved to have brought up.  Yep.  Yep. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, man.  It should have asked to be semi-worked.  All right.  Finally, the last clip.  Sam talking to Hulk Hogan, the second greatest wrestler of all time.  Who's the first?  Bob Backlund.  Ivan Putzky.  Stone Cold E.T.  There are some who think that you're in on this.  Like, people have actually come to me and been like, well, come on.  He's obviously in on it.  You're not.  I mean, it's a damaging thing, but you're not in on it.  Well, like Vivid Entertainment and several of these people have offered me an open checkbook.  So, hmm, I'm doing this to hurt my kids. 
[00:44:30]  I'm doing this to ruin my new marriage.  I'm ruining this to maybe lose my job.  It's E&A.  I'm doing this.  I mean, I don't want to.  And not making a dime.  Yeah, I don't get that.  Right.  You know, I mean, I don't.  I've been through enough.  I don't need this type of publicity.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, so.  Yeah, you've probably learned better than anybody that negative publicity is very different than positive publicity.  Oh, it'll change your life, bro.  So, I mean, if you think I'm in on it, bro, I don't know what to say.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, I really don't. 
[00:45:00]  I don't have an answer for that one.  I'm going to kick your ass.  You know, fucking start continuing on that line.  You know what I wonder?  You've got to feel bad for this guy.  Like you say, he's got a new marriage.  He's getting, you know, this is kind of like the second part of your life.  I wonder if it's, I mean, this is a pure guess, but is this a vindictive person who used to be in his life, who somehow connected with somebody who maybe used to be in Bubba's life, and is behind it on, and again, that could be totally false, too.  But it's just a curiosity. 
[00:45:30]  Is it possibly his ex?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, behind it, the timing, too, is somebody who probably knows what he's up to, because he was scheduled, like, I scheduled this interview with him weeks ago.  Like, we were supposed to talk about the TNA pay-per-view that's coming up.  Yeah.  So they knew that he was going to be going around doing these interviews.  And I'll say this.  Good for Hulk Hogan that he's doing the press.  Because what's happening is, like, a lot of these guys are such pussies or women.  He's out there at least talking about it. 
[00:46:00]  He's being honest.  So you look at this, and instead of just going, oh, I can't wait to see it, you're like, I fucking feel bad for this guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though it's like, I'll watch it, but it's shitty.  It doesn't feel as good as it would to see, like, a fun sex tape.  You're like, fuck, man.  I feel a lot of empathy for him having his life during the show.  Yeah, but I wouldn't buy it, and I wouldn't.  It's like, eh.  I look at it for what it is now, just this fucking vulture move.  I saw the quick clip, and that's it.  That's all I need to know and see.  And I'll tell you that.  Yeah, this guy was obviously set up bad. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  His publicists were, like, telling people, you know, try not to really talk about the sex tape.  Yeah, they have to say that.  Oh, boy.  But then once I was in there and talking to him, he was like, no, like, I want, this is  what I want to talk about.  Yeah.  Like, I want to be able to, you know, clear the air.  He felt very comfortable with Sam Roberts.  Well, he knew I was a little Hulkamaniac.  A little Hulkamaniac growing up, but you know the struggles.  You've heard, you know, you've grown up with the Hulkster.  He signed the picture of me dressed as him, and he wrote on it, thanks for keeping the 
[00:47:00]  dream alive.  Hold on.  What dream do you keep alive?  The dream of Hulkamania.  Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.  What's that?  Oh, my God.  What is it?  Well, they added a four.  Wrestling's going to destroy you.  Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins, and believe in yourself.  It's a tenet of Hulkamania.  And use your giant fucking cock when you can.  Yes.  Your fucking...  Well, that's where the vitamins are stored in.  Yeah.  Here's your protein. 
[00:47:30]  Pray you don't get her pregnant.  Yeah, right.  That was terrific.  We should break, because we got Kevin Smith coming in in about an hour, less than an hour.  Christopher Lloyd.  Wow.  That's cool.  Jack Dunphy's full of shit.  That's all I want to talk to him about, is Cuckoo's Nest.  Oh, boy.  You're going to have to fucking shoehorn yourself in there, because I got Back to the Future.  You guys can talk about Doc Brown, that and silliness all you want.  Fucking fucking...  You want to talk about Jimmy Gnatowski, knock yourselves out. 
[00:48:00]  It's all Mr. Tabert.  Yeah.  That's all I want to hear about.  I might be with Jimmy on this one.  Yeah.  What a fucking brilliant film.  Yeah.  And you made Travis laugh, so that's good.  Aw.  Feeling better, Travis?  I was just reminded again.  I'm glad to be here.  Aw.  Aw.  The Orioles.  Edgar.  How did the Orioles do?  Who's your favorite team, Edgar?  I don't like the Orioles.  I like the Milwaukee Brewers.  Of course he would like them.  Yeah.  Of course he would. 
[00:48:30]  He picked the perfect team.  Kirk Hammett, as well, from Metallica.  Stay there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a dumb song.  No, no.  This is a very, very dumb song.  As Jimmy is wearing his Kiss t-shirt.  Oh, yeah.  Kiss coming in here today.  We don't got Kiss, though.  No, they're just doing a town hall. 
[00:49:00]  They come in at...  I think we've got to smooth it over with Gene Simmons.  It's time, man.  It's time to let go.  It's time to let go.  Well, you know what?  It was a while ago.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Good.  And...  And...  And he's still a complete fucking asshole.  Never gonna fucking...  Forgive.  Wow.  Forgive.  He sang God of Thunder.  He really did.  Well, he did.  It's true.  Excuse me?  Pardon me?  Gene said to me...  Oh. 
[00:49:30]  He didn't have a problem with you whatsoever, so...  The Sam Robert interviews.  Yeah.  Part of the Sam Robert interview series.  He was crying when he said it.  He said...  When is the box set coming out?  He did say he didn't have a problem with you, so I don't know why you hold this resentment,  Anthony.  Yeah.  They were very good.  A public thank you to the great Justin Stangle.  Oh.  Love the Justin Stangle.  Who told me about this in advance secretly.  Mm-hmm.  And I never blabbed it.  Mm-hmm.  And he got me into the Ed Sullivan Theater, which was extremely hard to get tickets.  And he had his assistant meet me downstairs, Mike, who waited on line with me until the 
[00:50:00]  band was done rehearsing.  Yeah.  And made sure I got into the third row.  They took great care of me.  Third row, Ed Sullivan Theater, to see KISS perform live.  It's Letterman's Stage.  500 people, not even.  And they opened with their new song, which I really love.  And they did just a bunch of old stuff.  They know what people want to see.  That's awesome.  They don't do a whole bunch of too hip for the room shit or a bunch of B-side.  Yeah.  You know, they just know what people want to see.  Yeah.  I love them.  Nice.  Yeah, I saw the pictures you were tweeting. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And they're coming in today to do a town hall.  Jose is doing it.  The label wanted, like, a real music guy, which I get.  I mean, he's Headbagger's Ball.  Jose is all I'm saying.  Yeah, I was going to say that, but I was like, I couldn't think of a letter.  Double X.  Good one.  So I want to try to go sneak a picture with the Bond.  I have no picture with just them.  Wow.  I love when I tweet and then people are like, you know, Ace and Peter aren't there.  I know.  What?  But I love Ace and Peter.  Oh, Ace and Peter. 
[00:51:00]  I love those guys.  What am I going to do?  Tell Tommy and Eric to step out?  You're ripping off my only impression.  What's that?  The guy.  No, no, it's different.  Oh, it's different?  Yours is this.  Yeah, yeah.  Yours is this.  I don't want to know what.  And this was, Ace and Peter.  Mine's much louder.  I'm flattered that I might have influenced your character.  Yes.  Mine is just a louder version of yours.  For the people that don't know, that's what I hear now.  Yeah.  With these dumb haters.  But it's amazing how you, I know. 
[00:51:30]  I love it, yeah.  That it's just Tommy Thayer and Eric and Peter.  I get it.  And I love the original lineup.  More than I love breathing.  I love the original fucking four.  But it is what it is right now.  And that's fine.  And the band sounded great last night.  What am I going to do?  Not listen to the guitar?  You're just a super fan, and you've seen all different versions of these guys.  Yeah.  My only goal, and we're interviewing Peter.  But they're not getting back together anytime soon.  I don't think ever.  Unless they're inducted into it.  This could be ever at this point, right?  The only shot you'll see at them doing it is if they're inducted into the Rock and Roll 
[00:52:00]  Hall of Fame.  Then all four original members.  Oh, I thought they were already in there, because they've been a big influence on rock  and roll over the years.  Oh, that's right.  No.  Well, you can't give real credibility, because they nominated Public Enemy this year over  Kiss.  It's like an embarrassing fucking...  What did Johnny Rotten call it?  Oh, God.  A hideous fiasco.  Yeah.  Johnny Rotten was great.  A hideous fiasco.  I'm so glad that worked out yesterday.  Yeah, I told you.  I'm always right about this.  He's cool as fuck, man.  He wants to come back, too, and we will have him back. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, apparently he was saying good things about us down the hall.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Whatever.  He was a very good, a very fun interview, and a very talkative guy, and smart.  His manager is scary as fuck.  Yeah, he was a little nuts, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  He was weird.  He was scary, man.  He used to bodyguard him.  Did he?  Really?  Yeah, the manager.  He's probably tougher than he looks.  He looks like a kind of a quiet guy, but he's probably a major problem.  He looks like he's a serial killer.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  If you didn't know any better, you would assume he did some really bad things. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He had like a part shaved in his head, and then it was dyed red, just the part.  And then his whole, and then it was like a bird's nest haircut.  Yeah.  I call those the bird's nest, where it's shaved up all the way around.  Yeah, yeah.  And he didn't smile once, and that was a fun interview.  Everyone was laughing and having a good time.  I mean, I kept taking a peek at that guy.  He didn't fucking smirk or laugh or nothing.  No, he was communicating things to John the whole time, but I didn't know what he was 
[00:53:30]  trying to get to.  Yeah, we should have asked him, but I think we were all scared.  I know.  He was a weird guy, man.  He was strange.  Strange sort.  So, Alex Karras.  We announced this a couple days ago.  He's gone.  He passed away.  Yeah, the NFL great.  Webster fame.  Weah.  Monday Night Football.  Blazing Saddles.  Blazing Saddles, that guy.  Right.  77.  77?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  We got the Obama clip. 
[00:54:00]  All right.  All right.  Obama's talking about the first debate.  Yeah?  God, did he blow it.  He's making some kind of excuses.  Wow, did he blow it.  He's saying that, what?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  That he was just being polite or something?  Come on.  Let's see.  That debate.  What happened?  Well, who's asking him this?  Oh, that's Diane Sawyer.  Diane Sawyer.  I recognize her because I think she's still hot.  I thought it was Sam Roberts.  Nope, not a Sam Roberts interview.  That's Obama to cry.  I couldn't believe that. 
[00:54:30]  I'm such a worm.  I'd probably be like, I thought you won, Mr. President.  But she's like, what happened?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was, wow.  Terrible.  Horrible.  That debate.  What happened?  Well, Governor Romney had a good night.  I had a bad night.  It's not bad.  Well, it's not the first time I've had a bad night.  But I think what's important is that...  Can I stop this for a second?  You can't just casually say you had a bad night.  You're the President of the United States.  There's only two debates, right?  You can't have a bad night. 
[00:55:00]  Is it three?  I think it's three.  Oh, three.  Okay.  You can't have a bad night with debates.  Yeah, it hurts.  It hurts a lot.  He's got to come back strong now.  Oh, they're going to look to him now.  If he doesn't come back strong, he is really fucking in trouble.  I think so.  He's going to be in trouble.  I think so.  You can feel it out there.  Yep.  It's very close right now.  Is Romney in the lead?  Some polls.  Some polls.  The polls are so fucked now.  There's so many different ones out there that you could just pick one and say, yeah,  he's ahead.  Right. 
[00:55:30]  Pick another one.  He's not.  They've become nothing because there's no consistency.  You know Biden's going to have a good night.  That's tonight, right?  That's tonight.  I don't know, dude.  Biden will have a good night.  Dude, I don't know.  He's going to be full of zingers.  Zingers.  And sound bites.  You don't think Biden's going to have a good night?  He's a loose fucking cannon.  That's why he's going to have a good night.  I don't know if that's good.  Do you think Obama's nervous?  Yes.  Because Obama can't fucking control Biden.  They've sequestered Biden. 
[00:56:00]  They've sequestered him away to train for this debate.  But he can't help himself.  He can't help himself.  Biden is one of those guys, you can tell him a hundred times, you've got to be cool.  He can't help himself.  He can't.  I think you're going to see some good TV tonight.  But Ryan is very good.  He is a very good speaker and he's very good.  He seems to be that.  Yes.  Yeah.  And he has a four-year record to go after.  Right.  I think it's almost harder for an incumbent in a debate, unless your record's amazing.  Amazing.  Right.  Because no matter who you are, unless you're a giant governor, Romney's record as governor 
[00:56:30]  or Ryan's record is not as visible and known as what Obama's is because he's the president.  So any sitting president, I think, has a bit of a disadvantage because there's four years  of public major stuff for them to pepper you in.  Any time you brought up the economy, Obama had to put his head down.  Because you can't, how do you defend rampant unemployment?  And meanwhile, you know. 
[00:57:00]  But it's Romney, though.  Meanwhile, Romney, though.  But it's Romney.  What about it?  He was great.  He was great.  He was great.  I can't deny it.  He was great in that interview.  Yeah.  Can't deny it.  Here's more of Obama.  I think what's important is the fundamentals of what this race is about haven't changed.  You know, Governor Romney went to a lot of trouble to try to hide what his positions are.  So I'm not going to get an explanation of what you think happened, of why you had that. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  You know, one thing, you know, maybe this is because I played a lot of sports when I was  a kid and still do.  If you have a bad game, you just move on.  You look forward to the next one.  And it makes you that much more determined in the difference between this and sports  is that the stakes are so high.  Wow.  You can't even hear it in this clip.  He's he fumbles a lot for words when he doesn't have a speech prepared in front of him. 
[00:58:00]  He's he's not a very he's not as good a speaker as everybody gave him credit for being,  especially like at the Democratic National Convention.  But he shook up by Diane Sawyer and what happened.  You could hear it in his voice.  She just called him out on not answering your question.  So I'm not going to get an answer.  Yeah.  Fuck.  You know how much balls you have to have to say that to the president?  She has been through the mill over the years.  So she's one of those people that will ask anyone anything.  Obama's been beat up for four years.  And I think his I think it's starting to get to take his toll. 
[00:58:30]  You could hear it.  His confidence is he might not want the job.  I don't know.  Maybe he realized what the fuck who would ever want this job?  And I've heard that over the years.  It's the worst job you could possibly have my beliefs.  Thought I'd come in there with hope and change.  Man, maybe he'll be the first president to have a nervous breakdown from the pressure.  He's really fucking Joe Biden.  Let's do this, Joe.  I can't wait.  Zingers.  He will definitely have a few zingers tonight.  He's supposed to be. 
[00:59:00]  I fucking and I'm not saying because of policy.  I just fucking love Joe Biden.  I love the vice presidential debate.  The incumbent is supposed to be the attack dog for the president.  Right.  He's supposed to do and say the things that the president normally can't say during a debate  because it comes off as a little too harsh.  Yeah.  So that's going to be his stance.  And then you're going to have Ryan, who's going to be a facts and figures guy, who's going  to try to refute any.  You mean lying guy?  Lying guy. 
[00:59:30]  Well, if you're a Democrat, if you're a Democrat, that's what you'll say.  It's lying guy.  Just want to represent the other side.  That's what they would say.  Against the attack dog.  Exactly.  Yeah.  The lying guy and the attack dog that might have a few shooters before the debate.  You think Joe will have a few shooters?  Loosen up a little.  You know, you have a few shooters when you go home.  You're not the same person.  Here's a line you'll hear tonight.  Well, you know, while you've been busy working on your abs, I've been working on the economy. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy.  That's a zinger.  Yes.  That's a Joe Biden line.  Yeah.  Well, he's been going around saying the Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.  That's been his mantra lately.  Well, that's a good one to have.  It's good.  It's a good soundbite.  Yeah, but, boy, this whole Libyan embassy thing is really getting on top of Obama's back.  They won't say what it is.  Yeah, well, they're having hearings about it, and what's coming out is not very favorable for the White House. 
[01:00:30]  The fact that there wasn't any riot due to a video at all in front of the embassy.  It was an attack.  It was a 9-11 anniversary attack on the United States embassy staff, and that's all it was.  And it was very well-planned and very heavily armed group of people that attacked the embassy. 
[01:01:00]  And for the White House to come out and say that it was because of a video was an out-and-out lie, and they knew it.  And the ambassador had come forward and said he wanted and needed more security, begged for it, and they didn't give it to him.  Why didn't they?  That's what's coming out now.  I don't know why.  Who dropped the fucking ball on this?  And for people that I've tweeted and realized people are saying, well, you know, it's not the president's job.  The president does this. 
[01:01:30]  That's the State Department.  That's this.  That's the other thing.  No, it's his watch.  And if he wants to take credit for Osama bin Laden, then you've got to take credit for the fucking bad things, too.  I mean, Jesus Christ, the ball was fucking dropped.  Americans died because somebody wasn't fucking paying attention.  It is an election year, though, so you've got to cover that shit up.  Well, you cover it up, and it comes out, and it's looking very bad.  It's looking like they definitely knew something.  They kept it from the American people.  Someone made a mistake. 
[01:02:00]  They weren't given the security that they needed, that they asked for, and people died because of it.  And it was covered up in a way that was supposed to blame it on a videotape, when, meanwhile, it was an obvious anniversary of 9-11 terrorist attack.  And it's coming out.  Very good.  So we'll be watching the debate tonight.  I'll tell you after.  I'm just reading something somebody wrote.  It's very funny.  Paul Ryan ends an interview.  Is this all?  It's this week. 
[01:02:30]  A couple of days, yeah.  I haven't heard this clip yet.  I saw this.  Meanwhile, Michael Moore posted this on his shitter.  Well, he's a terrific American.  That fucking shitter instead of Twitter.  I love it.  He's a terrific American, though, Anthony.  Do you like that, Sam?  Loved it.  Sam!  Yeah, boo-hoo fucking Roberts.  That would be the name of your show.  Boo-hoo Roberts.  Welcome to the Boo-hoo Roberts hour.  You talk, I get you to boo-hoo.  Pissy eyes.  Turns everyone into pissy eyes.  Yeah, fucking Sam. 
[01:03:00]  He'll turn those tough eyes into liquid cum machines.  Right.  Cum.  Michael Moore tweeted this and tried to make it seem like Ryan came off looking bad in  this.  Right.  The reporter comes off looking like a fucking idiot, and Ryan comes off looking like he's  doing exactly what he should have done.  This guy had an agenda.  Let's listen.  Does this country have a gun problem?  Well, this country has a crime problem. 
[01:03:30]  Not a gun problem.  No, I mean, if you take...  Don't we have a gun problem?  No.  We don't have a gun problem.  Compared to other countries.  We have a car problem, too, then.  And I'm going to stick to that, even though it seems to be the hacky thing to say.  Then we have an alcohol problem.  Yeah.  We do have an alcohol problem.  Yeah.  We do have a gun problem.  No one's addressing it.  In this country.  It's not a gun problem.  I'm not talking about legal guns and all that shit.  I'm just saying in general, it seems like we have some kind of problem with guns.  There are plenty of laws.  There are plenty of laws that just aren't being adhered to and aren't being enforced. 
[01:04:00]  Plus, then, we have a gun problem.  No.  Then we have a law problem.  Then we have a crime problem.  Then we got to make the laws tougher.  We got to do something.  Because it seems like there's a lot of guns doing bad things.  There's also a cultural problem in this country with guns.  And that's got to be addressed.  A gun problem in general?  No.  It's not a gun problem.  A gun is hardware.  It's a piece of fucking hardware.  It's a hammer.  It's a fucking hammer that throws nails really far and fast.  Is that all it is?  It's all it is. 
[01:04:30]  No.  I mean, if you take a look at the gun laws we have, I don't even think President Obama  is proposing more gun laws.  We have good, strong gun laws.  We have to make sure we enforce our laws.  We have lots of laws that aren't being properly enforced.  We need to make sure we enforce these laws.  But the best thing to help prevent violent crime in the inner cities is to bring opportunity  in the inner cities.  It's to help teach people good discipline, good character.  That is civil society.  That's what charities and civic groups and churches do to help one another make sure that 
[01:05:00]  they can realize the value in one another.  And you can do all that by cutting taxes.  Right?  With a big tax cut.  Those are yours, not mine.  Thank you very much, sir.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That was kind of strange, trying to stuff words in people's arms?  Well, it sounds like you're trying to answer the question.  That's a little odd.  I thought the reporter came off just sounding like a cunt.  Yes.  Yes.  Like he's talking about the gun thing.  And Ryan addresses it very, very nicely. 
[01:05:30]  He did a good job addressing what this guy's question was.  So then he didn't get a good bite on that.  So in the middle of discussing the gun laws and a problem that he set, he then throws  a tax thing in just to try to fucking hang him up on that?  Well, the way he threw it in, it was what was cunt.  Right?  So that's going to happen by doing this?  That's what the agenda is.  If he would have said to him, well, okay, that's all well and good, but Governor Romney  proposes cutting taxes.  Right.  How will cutting taxes for wealthier Americans translate into civic and church groups helping 
[01:06:00]  people in poverty?  How does that, how does that connect?  And can I clear something up, please?  Romney is not trying to cut taxes for the wealthy.  He just doesn't want them raised.  The expiration of the Bush tax cuts.  January 1st.  Yeah.  Which, by the way, everybody's fucked on that one.  January 1st.  Look it up.  Look it up.  Everyone across the board is getting their taxes raised.  Even the middle class.  Everybody's getting fucked January 1st. 
[01:06:30]  So, but Romney isn't talking about tax breaks.  Somebody tweeted me.  Somebody tweeted me and said, Anthony, how do you feel about Romney flip-flopping?  You're not going to get those tax cuts that you were promised.  It's like, first of all, I never heard him promise me a tax cut.  And I just don't want my taxes raised.  But he's flip-flopping?  No.  He never fucking said he was going to lower taxes for the wealthy.  That's what fucking the Democrats have been saying. 
[01:07:00]  But what's the real deal?  He's not saying that.  The real deal is, let's keep the fucking Bush tax breaks that were put in place years ago in place until this economy fucking shapes up.  Because raising taxes is a horrible thing to do.  And what Romney said, getting more people to work will make more revenue for the government because more people will be working and being taxed.  And you raise revenue that way instead of just taxing the few people that are working now.  Who's going to raise the taxes? 
[01:07:30]  Obama?  Obama.  Fuck, I've got to vote for Romney then.  Well, there you go.  It's obvious.  What I don't like about the government is, like you guys have said, you don't know where the fucking money is going.  The fact that they had to stop him from giving $200 billion to Egypt, what the fuck are we doing?  And Republicans might do that too.  Romney wants that money contingent on keeping the peace treaty alive with Israel.  Right.  And this whole, this Islamic fucking government that's in place, the Muslim Brotherhood, why are we giving them fucking money? 
[01:08:00]  Why are we giving any country in the Middle East money?  Yes.  Enough.  Why are our troops in Germany?  Well, we've got to protect the oil.  We've got to protect the oil.  That's why.  That's why we give them money.  We've got to protect the oil.  The stability in the region.  Oh, fuck the stability in the region.  Well, but it's not that easy.  I hate stability in the region.  We've got to have a plan B.  We don't have a plan B, so we have to keep giving them money for now. 
[01:08:30]  We do Alaska.  Just drill in Alaska.  Oh, but it's, yeah.  Drill, drill, drill.  Drill, baby drill.  But until that's all set up, we have no choice.  We've got to, like, keep that area stable.  Keystone pipeline.  We have to.  The Keystone pipeline.  How many jobs?  And just bringing up the Keystone pipeline will lower fuel prices, which, by the way, are edging on $5 a fucking gallon in this country.  Will that fuck up the wildlife in Alaska?  No.  You sure?  It's positive.  I've done the research. 
[01:09:00]  I've got to vote for Robby, then.  I've got to.  We've got to flip-flop.  Fucking Canada.  Let him run a pipeline across stupid Canada.  Exactly.  Who gives a shit if it fucks up a few owls?  Exactly.  Hey, moose, go fuck yourself.  I need to fucking drive.  A nice, greasy fucking elk.  Who cares?  We're going to fuck up the owls?  I don't know.  The bomb's getting my vote.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you are a flip-flopper.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  Oh, man.  A lot of the undecideds, you can tell in some of these polls that are ridiculous and don't make any sense and go each way. 
[01:09:30]  But the undecideds is where this whole fucking election is all about.  It really is.  I don't think it's ever been as important.  Is it really going to be close?  I think it's going to be very close.  It's three and a half weeks out, right?  Very close.  A little less than four, I guess.  I think it's going to be a very close election.  Yeah, I think you're right.  And it really is coming down to the wire as far as who's going to be ahead come Election Day.  Because they're neck and neck, and every little bit of leeway you can get is very important right now. 
[01:10:00]  You want to hear Rick Springfield singing in the subway?  Rick Springfield.  It's a buddy of mine.  I'm so jealous.  I'm so jealous.  She should be with me.  Just these girls.  I guess he's got another album coming out that most people won't buy.  Moodery!  Why would you even sell Rick Springfield?  What are you talking about?  He's a nice man.  Don't sell Rick Springfield.  He's a nice guy and all, but who's going to buy a Rick Springfield album?  Portrait mode!  I know. 
[01:10:30]  They want to hear fucking Jessie's Girl.  Yeah.  They don't want to hear whatever he's singing now.  But he's promoting.  He's doing a little guerrilla marketing, and he hit the subways to sing.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, I get it.  Uh-huh.  Guerrilla.  What?  No, marketing.  Oh, marketing.  Damn it!  I thought I had you.  No.  So he sang in the subway?  One of his new songs?  No, he sang Jessie's Girl in the subway.  Oh, good.  Jessie's Girl in the subway.  And now, was there a lot of people around?  Did they know it was him? 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Or did they slowly kind of go like, that guy looks like Rick Springfield?  Well, based on the video, he's got quite a little surrounding of soccer moms.  Oh, boy.  That don't know how to fucking turn their phone sideways for a video?  I can't believe they can even use the video function.  I blame the Apple 5, though.  At this point, there should be...  Blame the Apple 5?  I blame the Apple 5, because at this point, they should be able to, if you fuck up and  film shit this way, one fucking button, whatever the fuck, where they can fix that for you. 
[01:11:30]  We're changing that aspect ratio, though.  I understand.  You've already cut the sides off.  But they figured out everything else.  They should be able to figure this one out.  If we've learned anything, it's that most Apple 5 users don't even know what a camera  is.  Well, I don't know about that, but it's got an Apple on it.  Dude, you saw that girl.  Oh, Jimmy! 
[01:12:00]  I don't want to hear them say it.  I don't want to hear them say it.  Oh, my God.  And she's loving with that body.  I just know it.  And he told her it is all.  Boom!  You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl.  Some homeless guy just sticks a bottle in his neck.  I wish that I had Jessie's girl.  Why does Rick Springfield have a high voice now?  Yeah.  Some of the moms singing the ladies.  Rooning it. 
[01:12:30]  You got an opportunity to get Rick Springfield in the subway doing a song like that, and all  you're hearing are a bunch of fucking yentas waiting for the train.  Bunch of hens!  Hens!  Bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch, bunch,  Want Jesse's eggs.  Bok, bok, bok, bok, bok.  Bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok.  How many women are hoping that Rick goes,  hey, you want to go around the corner here?  I want to put it in your shitter in the subway.  How many would go for it, though? 
[01:13:00]  A lot.  You're in fucking smelling alcove.  Rick wanted his ass eaten in the bathroom after a long train ride.  How can I find a woman like that?  That doesn't seem to be a reason to change.  You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute.  I want to tell them that I love her, but the point is probably moot. 
[01:13:30]  Moot.  Moot.  Moot.  She sounds like the fucking girl that's kidnapped in fucking Silence of the Lambs.  Yeah.  My mother will sing in the subway for you.  Who's Rick Springfield voting for, you think?  I bet he's an Obama guy.  I got to vote fucking Romney.  I bet he's an Obama guy.  That does it right there.  Yeah, but he did Jesse's girl.  He did.  Fuck.  Jesse's girl.  Bam.  I'm going to vote for Obama.  Okay.  I have to.  Mmm.  Mmm.  But she's watching him with those eyes. 
[01:14:00]  And she's loving him with that body I just know it.  And he's holding her in his arms.  Late, late at night.  You know I wish that I had Jesse's girl.  Are we still doing this?  Yeah.  It's a bunch of ladies singing.  I'm done.  This could have been 30 seconds.  I'm done.  Are we still doing this?  Yeah, right?  I guess so.  I'm done.  Fuck.  You're good with it.  I'm done.  Whole song?  I've moved on.  There's not a woman to be had in that crowd. 
[01:14:30]  You know, he's putting out a documentary about how loyal his fans are.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What is it called?  I don't remember.  My loyal fans.  It's traveling through the film festivals right now.  Do you think you'll get him to interview him, maybe?  I am.  You already interviewed him.  I interviewed him.  I didn't get him to cry.  Oh, man.  But I did get him to admit that he was not a sex addict, but a fan of sex.  Man, that's not bad.  Why?  Is there a rumor for you to be a sex addict?  He said, you know, kind of said something about being like a sex addict.  But then when I asked him about it, he said he didn't want to call it an addict because 
[01:15:00]  it wasn't behavior that he couldn't control.  No.  And so I asked, so he's just a huge fan.  Did you ask him how he dyes his hair?  Because it's really creepy.  I saw him in a Starbucks on 110 one day.  I guess they were playing in one of the local venues on Long Island.  I was doing one of my Huntington visits, and I stopped into the Starbucks, and there  he was ordering with his creepy, dark black hair.  Anybody recognize him?  Everybody.  Yeah, he's pretty fucking famous.  People want to talk about Jesse's girl with him all the time.  Yeah, who's Jesse? 
[01:15:30]  Who's Jesse?  Oh, so jealous.  And I'm looking in the mirror all the time.  Oh, God.  How long?  Wondering what she don't see in me.  I've been funny.  I've been cool with the lines.  This is so douchey.  It's supposed to be.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hey, clap.  This is the worst.  Cut.  Wow.  Wow.  This is awful. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  Shut up, you hang.  A lot of moisture in those pants.  Jesus.  Yuck.  Edgar can't clap in rhythm and gets exhausted by it.  No, he's clapping and getting tired.  Edgar, shut up.  I know Edgar's all tired.  Like Jessica's girl.  Jessica's girl.  Jessica.  I know a woman like that, like Jesse's girl.  Right. 
[01:16:30]  You're still doing this for real?  Oh, my God.  Right.  I want Jesse's girl.  Where can I find a woman like that?  Where can I find a woman like that, like Jesse's girl?  To Dr. Noah Drake, by the way.  I wish that I had Jesse's girl.  General Hospital.  Yes, he was Dr. Noah Drake.  I want Jesse's girl.  Yeah, back on a good day.  Can I find a woman like that?  No, you dumb broads.  Know what I learned from this clip?  What?  Middle-aged women just stink. 
[01:17:00]  They're such simpletons.  They really are just dummies.  Horrible.  Middle-aged women stink.  I learned that from Anthony.  To the women out there, don't let...  Don't turn into one of these middle-aged women that just are simpletons.  God.  Oh, it's horrible.  The soccer mom mentality.  Right.  That whole thing.  God, it's just...  How do you relate to that?  No.  And still have, like, fun.  No. 
[01:17:30]  That's it.  Oh, here he goes.  Friend of mine.  He's a buddy of mine.  What does he say?  This is a better...  This is a better...  Ricky Springfield.  This version is better.  Yeah.  Little mixtapes together.  You know, I put all my favorite songs together.  Which one is this?  Number 11.  I love it.  You know, when you buy a tape or something...  Oh, my God.  Great.  All coked out.  And the songs are like...  The fans put them in some fucking order.  Like, they want you to listen to it in that order.  You know, I hate that.  I fucking hate that.  I don't like to be told what to listen to, when to listen to it, or anything.  And then it stops. 
[01:18:00]  It's like all...  So tense.  Intense.  Yeah, they're fucking...  It's so good.  It's masterful.  My Awesome Mixtape No. 6.  It's like...  It's like...  What is this?  Number 11?  Yeah.  Like a famous song.  It's Cosmo.  Cosmo with the firecrackers.  He whispers over...  Out of the side.  Firecrackers.  Huh?  What does he do to that poor kid?  He hugs him and just pats him on the ass.  Pats him on the ass.  Hugs him.  Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  He's smoking coke out of a fucking...  He's freebasing with a robe. 
[01:18:30]  Silver robe with his underpants.  He rules.  What a great scene.  It's so tense.  There he goes.  He's dancing.  The one.  I just know it.  Ricky St. Phil.  The funny of mine.  The funny of mine.  Jesse's girl.  I'm so jealous. 
[01:19:00]  I want her house.  Jesse's girl.  She's just be with me.  I can't have a woman like that.  It's so good, man.  Rick Springfield.  That's great.  I forgot about that.  She should be with me.  She should be with me.  That fucking...  What an amazing scene that is.  That is great.  It's shot really well, too.  That's a really underrated...  The camera's moving very slowly. 
[01:19:30]  It's never like a still shot.  Really.  I fucking love that movie.  Booker Nights is so good.  It's one of my favorite movies.  When he walks over, he's got the...  It's a silver flowing, silky robe with creepy fucking tight underpants.  It's hanging open.  Yeah.  And the way he walks over, he's so loose when he walks.  He looks like he's been doing coke.  Yeah.  He walks over and he hugs the Filipino kid.  It's Cosmo.  Yeah.  He points at him.  Yeah.  Just setting off firecrackers in my house.  But he doesn't blink. 
[01:20:00]  No.  No.  It just doesn't surprise him.  I love it.  An amazing scene.  Great movie.  Yeah.  Speaking of coke.  Oh.  The Lohans are out of the game.  Yeah.  What happened?  What a fucked up family this is, huh?  Yeah.  I guess there's a phone call on TMZ.  Yeah.  You can't really understand the phone call, but there's like transcripts.  It's out on Long Island, right?  Basically, a lot of eyes are on Dina Lohan these days, because she seems pretty fucked  up, pretty fucked up in the head.  Dina Lohan, it's a buddy of mine. 
[01:20:30]  What show was she on recently where she was all fucked up?  Dr. Phil?  Dr. Phil.  Dr. Phil, he takes care of people.  That's why you go on that show.  He takes care of people.  Dr. Phil is a dick.  Yeah.  You think he's a dick?  Yes.  Yes.  What an opportunistic phony.  Dr. Fool.  Ah, good one.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Why?  He allowed Ted Williams to hand out fucking pocketbooks.  Ted Williams.  That Ted Williams.  Yes.  Hey.  Kraft macaroni and cheese. 
[01:21:00]  I know I've been a bad father.  You know you love it.  Here's a Louis Vuitton.  Brand new Louis Vuitton.  I got his daughter.  One of my best clubs.  I love that one.  Favorite clubs ever.  He abandons his fucking kids.  Horrible father, but he's going to make it all good.  And his daughter, the first time he's seeing her, he goes, I got you a Louis Vuitton.  She's going to be like, oh, daddy.  Oh, that makes up for everything.  Yeah, that makes up for everything.  After she, like, what, spilled her guts out to Dr. Phil and her horrible father.  I got you a Louis Vuitton. 
[01:21:30]  Have some Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Can we find that clip?  At least he's learning how to spend responsibly.  No, he's not.  Oh, literal, Jimmy.  You've got to find the Louis Vuitton clip because it's been a while.  And I mean, I was shitting into it when he was living in a box.  Might smell like my duty.  Just the part about the Louis Vuitton.  Is this it?  I don't know.  Let me find it.  It says Ted Williams' Louis Vuitton.  It's a remake.  God, what a disaster he is.  Yeah, people picked up on the whole Louis Vuitton thing. 
[01:22:00]  So you've got the Lohans.  You've got the mom there who's pretty fucked up.  Seems like she likes to do some partying in her own right, I would imagine.  That is a fucked up family.  And then you've got Lindsay Lohan, who's now living in New York.  I guess they went out together and on the way back to Long Island, Merrick.  Merrick, Long Island.  That's where Dina Lohan lives.  Trash.  Merrick.  Some Long Island trash.  They're fighting in the car.  That's great.  And then they continue the fight.  I think it's like 8 in the morning at this point.  Well, like regular Joes are trying to go to work.  They hear the mom and the daughter yelling and screaming on the front lawn. 
[01:22:30]  God.  And then I guess.  What a shitty family.  And then I guess Lindsay calls Michael Lohan.  Yeah.  And Michael Lohan's convinced that Lindsay Lohan's being kidnapped by the mom.  What a great thing to do.  You've got a horrible situation going on.  Call Michael Lohan.  He'll fucking make the whole thing better.  And then why are we all able to hear this phone call?  Because I would assume Michael Lohan has TMZ on speed dial.  Yeah.  Of course he does.  For his own fucking, whatever you want to call it. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  For his own benefit.  He's using his own fucking kid to get some attention for himself.  It's got Harvey's cell.  What the fuck?  I hear the call is really hard to understand though, huh?  It is.  There's a transcript.  So you listen to it a little bit and see if you like it.  Yeah.  All right.  Yes, I do.  You're right.  Wait.  Stop this shit.  She says, yes, I do.  Go ahead.  You know what?  I'm asking you to be respectful.  You're being.  And Michael says, call up the dot, dot, dot, dot. 
[01:23:30]  He's kidnapping you.  How do you f***ing this?  How do you get ready to get everyone in the car?  Problem?  Let pause this.  Yeah.  Wow, they're all fucked up again, huh?  It's hard to hear, but they're all fucked up, yeah.  You want to go back a little bit?  Lousy family.  So wait.  This is on 911 recording or TMZ? 
[01:24:00]  This is 911, right?  No.  No, because she called her dad, not 911.  So how is this recorded?  So how is it recorded?  I'm assuming her dad probably recorded it.  Oh, her dad probably records every phone call.  It's an assumption, but yeah.  It's a f***ing vulture.  And then he gives it to TMZ.  For what?  Because he's a shithead.  Because he's a shitty f***ing dad.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Yeah.  They all just want to be famous in that family?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very much so.  I mean, if you're Dina Lohan, why do you go on Dr. Phil?  She's not looking for help. 
[01:24:30]  If she's looking for help, she'd go to an actual doctor.  If she was looking for help, Sam Roberts show.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm thinking.  That's right.  Get to what's really going on.  Get to the root of the problem.  Waterworks Roberts.  I don't know what to do with this, because it's hard to hear the phone call.  It's kind of funny, just to look, because you could definitely hear audibly, like Danny  was saying earlier, when you hear him going, uh, you're being kidnapped right now.  Because it's like, what are you talking about?  Because Lindsay's in the car with her mom going back to Long Island, so who's kidnapping her?  He thinks the driver's kidnapping Lindsay Lohan. 
[01:25:00]  What?  I don't know what he's talking about.  What would he want with Lindsay Lohan?  All right.  You know how annoying that would be?  You kidnap her after an hour.  You're like, all right, just get the f*** out of my house.  Please leave.  Right.  Why would you want that?  There's not enough money in the world to deal with that s***.  Mom, listen, mom is threatening everyone.  That's what Michael says?  Yeah.  You already told me that I was a piece of s***.  Oh.  That's what Lindsay says.  Is that what Lindsay says?  Mom is threatening everybody?  You already told me that I'm a piece of s***. 
[01:25:30]  Did mom, did mom say, did mom say she's calling the cops on you?  Did mom say she's calling the cops on you?  Yeah, she's calling the cops on you in the house apparently from what the conversation has heard.  Is she in the car with you?  You were just on the phone.  You were just saying you were calling cops, right?  You were just saying you were calling cops, right?  But you just said that.  Let me speak to this driver.  He's kidding.  He's kidding.  He's kidding.  Lindsay.  Just tricked me.  He was kidnapping. 
[01:26:00]  Pause.  All right, there's the part.  Pause.  So Michael goes, Lindsay, he's kidnapping.  Well, does he know the father?  He doesn't know the mother's in the car yet.  I think he doesn't know the mother's in the car yet.  So.  He's like, is she with you?  Is she with you?  And Lindsay's being his name.  I wouldn't want to kidnap Lindsay Lohan.  She has.  I want to go back to that point.  She's got some f***ing issues.  She's crying on the phone with her daddy, and now she's talking about like $40,000 in  this next clip.  Oh, yeah.  Then Lindsay goes, you're crazy.  I was like, give me my money back.  Give me my $40,000 back.  I guess she lent her mom $40,000 because her mom's saying she needs the money because there's 
[01:26:30]  foreclosure going on.  What a f***ing piece of s*** family.  All chairs.  So then realized maybe she doesn't really need the $40,000.  So now she wants the $40,000 back from her mom that I just gave you because you won't  do that.  It's not her fault.  You just don't pay.  And then it's just, I don't even know what the f*** she's trying to say there.  Give me my money back.  Give me my $40,000 back.  I thought I just gave you this thing at all.  And I know that it's sad.  It's because you don't do it.  No, it's not her fault.  You just don't pay.  You give me my money back. 
[01:27:00]  I didn't know her, but you don't f***ing do it.  You give me my money back.  I'm not trying to give it back to you.  Like, you're sick.  You don't give me anything.  You don't do anything for anyone.  You know what I'm doing.  You do everything for everyone.  You gave mom $40,000?  Yes.  When did you give it to her?  Thanks for she didn't give her.  She's full of s***.  She's lying to you, Lindsay.  She's lying.  You don't want to go get it for her.  You don't want to go to there.  I just, I just. 
[01:27:30]  No, no, no.  I just.  That's because you've put the f***ing public off in my entire life.  What?  If you want to go to her, what do you want to go to her?  Do you want to go to her?  Dad, she's like closing you.  She's like touching you.  I'll pause.  Oh, boy.  This part I read in the paper.  Yeah, so then Lindsay's saying, Dad, she's on cocaine.  She's like touching her neck and s***.  Ah.  Because the mom's in the car.  Oh, boy.  A little strange.  Daughter hangs her out to dry.  But it does show you why Lindsay Lohan is such a disaster.  It's fucked up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's f***ing dog s*** parents.  Yes. 
[01:28:00]  Because she's having a fight with her mom, and then she calls the father for help, I guess.  And then the father f***ing tapes the phone call, I'm assuming.  Yeah, yeah.  And then passes it on to TMZ, I'm assuming.  What a disgusting guy.  They really are.  She should have been taken away years ago.  The phone call.  She's 24 or something.  I know.  She's an adult.  I mean, when she was a child, she should have been taken out of the family and f***ing put  in foster care.  And then Michael, once again, mom's in the car with you.  Mom's in the car with me. 
[01:28:30]  Yes, she's been taken out of the family.  Well, she's kidnapping you.  Well, I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  I don't like this.  There's like a f***er.  She called and talked, she said.  Well, where is she taking you now, Lindsay?  There's a lot of people who are talking about.  I'm afraid she's going to do this big s*** that I always tell you.  Have you been arrested?  I hate you.  Has she been out all night with you?  Yes, she's been out all night, Dad.  And she can't find the bracelet, too?  No, we can't worry about that. 
[01:29:00]  I just said.  Where is she?  This is what I'm fighting.  I know.  Where is she dying the bracelet?  Did you go to?  She was the same disgusting thing to me.  She's horrible.  She just said.  I'm dead to her.  I'm dead to her now.  That's what I'm doing to me.  And I have a cash on my leg.  I am proof of what happened.  Mom, could you put a cash on your leg?  Could you pause that a minute?  He's reiterating things like he's recording.  He knows it's being recorded. 
[01:29:30]  So what is he saying about recording his daughter?  So he wants all this on tape.  We don't know if he did for real.  It sure seems like it.  And it's taped.  And I don't think it's the Lindsay side.  He's a piece of s***.  And so is the mother.  They're just terrible.  But Lindsay's stupid.  But it's like, you're 24, cut these f***ing deadweights, this dog s*** parents you got  stuck with, cut them off.  Because no one talks about her work.  When's the last time anybody said, hey man, did you see that? 
[01:30:00]  Every time Lindsay Lohan has become the punchline.  The joke, yeah.  It's like, it's the joke.  No one talks about what she's working on as a real artistic value, or hey, that was  a good movie, or she's a good actress.  I don't even know if she's a f***ing good actress.  She's doing the Liz Taylor thing now.  Yeah.  The Liz Taylor story.  And she might be great.  Maybe.  Who knows?  No one will care.  It's overshadowed by her f***ed up life and family.  Her dumb personal life.  Hard family that she's got.  Exhausting.  What's the last part of the club that says, she's like the f***ing devil right now. 
[01:30:30]  Oh boy.  F*** you.  Oh, that's it.  Yeah, okay.  Wow.  That's pretty cool about a devil.  Of course it is.  Oh, yeah.  Damn.  You like that type of music?  Lilo.  Seems so devilish.  Lilo, yo.  That's f***ed up.  I don't know.  It's kind of hard to just f***ing get rid of your family, though.  Just don't communicate with them.  Well, it's the only one.  You don't have to have them murdered.  Sometimes it's the most logical thing you could do. 
[01:31:00]  Ignore them.  They're f***ing, they're toxic, parasitic shitheads.  Yep.  You're doing a movie and you're dealing with your f***ing cunt mother being on coke?  Oh, f*** you.  Yeah.  Because she's jealous of her, probably.  Yeah.  And she wants to be the famous one.  She's so jealous.  And then you've got the father who wants his own fame.  Yeah, yeah.  And they don't give a f*** what that means to their daughter.  The mother, I guess, takes 40, or the mother allegedly accepts 40 grand, and then it looks  like the father tapes her and puts it on TMZ. 
[01:31:30]  They're f***ing parasites.  Just f***ing leeches.  Parasites.  By the way, how this ended, I think I said it earlier, they continued their fight after  they left the car and after they hung up with Michael Lohan on the front lawn as people  were trying to go to work on Long Island.  And then there's a picture in the paper, because I guess, you know, then you get the paparazzi  and whatnot.  The glitterati.  The people that glitter.  The mom and the daughter there hug it out.  Yeah.  That's how it ended.  Yeah.  With a hug out. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Typical dysfunctional, shitty family.  It's probably just a typical Wednesday night in that family.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Or Tuesday night, whenever the f*** it was.  Jesus.  What a f***ing situation to be in.  Oh, yuck.  That family stinks.  Yeah.  Well, we got Kevin Smith next.  Oh, what is he promoting?  Comic book?  Yeah.  Comic book men season two.  Nice.  He's always doing something.  He's doing a panel tomorrow at Comic Con. 
[01:32:30]  He's paneling something?  No, he's doing a panel.  I thought he was working or something.  I was like, that stuff's really dated.  The wood paneling.  Everybody's going to be at Comic Con this weekend.  All of our guests today.  Sam, everybody.  We got Comic Con this weekend.  Yeah, and Kirk Hammett's going to be there, and Kevin Smith, and Christopher Lloyd will  all be there.  And they're all going to be on our show, Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Not yours.  Christopher Lloyd was also a Klingon in Star Trek 3?  Yeah.  That's correct.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Jack Dunphy's full of shit. 
[01:33:00]  That's all I care about, and that's all we're talking about.  Yeah.  It's Cuckoo's Nest.  It was also in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Let's not forget people.  Oh, that's cute.  Everyone forgets that.  Professor Plumbing Clue.  Adorable.  Come on.  Come on.  Doc Brown.  Oh, yeah.  Allegedly.  Let me put it to you this way, Jim Norton.  More people know him as Doc Brown than know him from Cuckoo's Nest.  No.  More people know him because here's what he said.  When Nicholson threw, or Chief threw the fucking sink through the window, he thought that McMurphy 
[01:33:30]  had gotten away, so he sat up and went, grrr.  That crazy fuck.  He was a crazy fuck.  He certainly was.  In that movie.  What a great movie.  Oh.  Great movie.  He was Uncle Fester, too, right?  Yeah, he was in the movie.  So why don't we ask him what he's known most for?  Mr. Tabert.  Doc Brown.  Nope.  Mr. Tabert.  Gotta be Doc Brown. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, it's Doc Brown.  It's so Doc Brown.  I'm gonna go Uncle Fester.  I prefer Professor Plum.  $10 each.  It's so Doc Brown.  It's so Uncle Fester.  Back to the Future is a part of pop culture and has been for years.  Yeah, but MC Hammer did the Addams Family fucking song.  Oh, God.  And Clue is a board game.  Yeah.  Board, all right.  The guy who made the sink that Will Sampson threw through the window is more famous than  Doc Brown.  No.  You tell him, Jimmy.  Doc Brown.  Professor Plum.  Oh, my God.  You people are out of your minds. 
[01:34:30]  I say Doc Brown, and I know he's gonna know.  Guaranteed.  Mr. Tabert.  I'm gonna say to him, how many times a day does somebody walk up to you and go, Jack Dunphy's  full of shit?  Never.  Guaranteed.  He's probably like, I can't get on a plane anymore.  I gotta fly private.  They walk up to him and go, when this thing hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some  serious shit.  There's a great story in Chris Jericho's book about him finding Christopher Lloyd in a gas  station. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  And going up to him and yelling out 88.8 gigawatts.  Oh, God.  And just feeling humiliated when Christopher Lloyd said, number one, do you know how often  I get that?  And number two, it's not even the right quote.  No.  He just sulked back to his car.  Tell me what's better, Doc Brown or that fucking confused psycho?  He really looks crazy.  What a fucking kook.  Look at that picture.  But I mean, listen to the music here.  Exactly.  Everyone knows.  Everyone knows this.  Mr. Tabert. 
[01:35:30]  You know, Professor Plum was maybe sort of banging Miss Scarlet in clue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we take a break?  Because Kevin Smith is here.  Or how about Captain Kirk?  Yeah.  I want all information for the Genesis device.  And he's got his little Klingon head on.  That's a good one.  Oh, I know what I want to ask him.  Were you guys actually watching the baseball game when you were cheering?  Oh, no, they weren't.  The TV was off.  I already know the answer.  Remember?  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  Somebody get me a fucking wiener before I die.  Holy shit.  Was that a good movie?  We're not going to acknowledge Taxi with this guy?  It's a great show.  What the fuck?  But yeah, but you know what?  What the fuck?  I want to talk about the real Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd fucking work.  Yes.  Cuckoo's Nest.  Cuckoo's Nest.  They were both in that.  That's right.  Mr. Martini.  And then later brought together again for Taxi.  Yeah, but that's where it all started.  It begins and ends there.  And then Clue is after.  Who cares?  We're going to have some answers today because we'll ask him all these questions. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, boy.  We're going to have some answers.  I hope he's okay with the questions.  Kevin Smith is next.  He's not here yet.  Shut up.  He's not here yet.  That's why I was talking about Clue so much.  Why were you talking about Clue?  Were you trying to drop Clues?  Take us out, you fucking...  Chuck!  Chuck!  It's Marvin!  Your cousin Marvin Barry!  You know that new sound you're looking for?  Well, listen to this!  Sirius XM. 
[01:37:00]  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There, there, there.  Why the Nirvana?  No reason?  Just cause.  Are we going to sing today?  Sure.  Here it comes.  Come on.  Here it comes.  Here it is.  What is this? 
[01:37:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  I love how Iroch throws his arms up in disgust.  Like, oh, God.  Someone fucked me.  Aren't you the guy?  Wouldn't you just double-check it, Iroch?  Iroch.  How does this happen?  Why?  Why didn't you just play the song?  Because I...  Oh, stupid Sal's here.  Oh, fuck.  Sal.  What's the matter?  Eric said, load the rejoiner, not the hook.  So I loaded the rejoiner.  I said Nirvana song.  I did exactly that. 
[01:38:00]  You know what?  I'm a witness today.  What happened?  I am a witness today.  What happened?  What'd you say?  Now, what did he say to you?  He said, load any rejoiner by Nirvana.  So I was like, okay.  And, Iroch, what did you say?  I said, load a Nirvana song.  I am a witness today who wants to take bets.  I know exactly what was said.  How do you know?  Because I walked out of the bathroom, walked out of the studio to go to the bathroom, and  I heard Iroch say something.  Oh, and now we're getting a... 
[01:38:30]  I am absolutely a star witness in this case.  We got a conflict.  I'm going to believe Sal.  I'm going to go against you and believe Eric.  That Eric said...  Anyone else want in?  Eric is telling me.  Why are you holding Travis, Danny?  Why are you holding him?  They're always holding each other and massaging each other.  Danny is a Peter Pumper.  Holy fuck.  I know he got us as sad today because of his Orioles, but...  Yeah.  I'm going to go Eric.  Whoa!  However...  Eric's telling the truth?  However, I will say that Eric was not specific.  It was specific enough to say, make sure that there are lyrics in that song. 
[01:39:00]  But he said, load any Nirvana song.  Song.  I believe Eric.  You believe Sal Anthony.  And Sal, I'll tell you why.  If he said rejoiner, then that means that rejoiner, not a song, right?  Correct.  Right.  Danny, you want to know this?  I am so a star witness on this.  I'm going to go Eric.  I say Eric said song, and I think wires got crossed.  Isn't it amazing that as much as everybody has always turned against Eric, that's how  far low Sal is?  Yeah, that is true. 
[01:39:30]  That even against Eric, everybody goes against Sal, except for Anthony.  I'm just...  But it's not that I believe Sal.  I'm just hoping it was.  He's so great.  Yeah.  Well, as the star witness in this case.  Your testimony.  Who said E-Rock?  Who said E-Rock?  E-Rock telling the truth?  Yeah.  Everyone but me.  I believe E-Rock.  Well, you would be right!  Oh, no!  In your face!  Oh, Sal, you piece of shit.  I walked out of the studio...  I walked out of the studio...  Thanks, John.  ...and I put Pete here.  God.  And I heard E-Rock say, put on a Nirvana song. 
[01:40:00]  Well, hope...  Because then I was walking down the hall going, ooh, I'm going to get to hear Nirvana, a band  I kind of like.  That's true.  Never underestimate how much Sal sucks.  Wait, hold on.  Absolutely said Nirvana song.  Hold on.  Pete Hair wants to chime in.  Oh, you want to say what?  Another lie?  No, Eric.  How did you deliver that message to me?  Vocally, I guess?  Yeah, with that fat mouth.  Through a hero sandwich.  Yeah, he thought it was a microphone.  Sorry, Eric.  Go ahead.  Hold it. 
[01:40:30]  I told the intern...  Maybe the halibut in his craw was a little...  That's what O-Poix did.  What happened?  Howl-a-bit.  Howl-a-bit.  Oh, howl.  Yeah.  That's a good video.  Howl-a-bit my finger.  Take us out, you fucking woke up.  No, no, not yet.  Now Sal's trying to defend himself, but I absolutely heard Nirvana's song.  Yeah.  Eric, how did I find out this news?  I told the intern to tell you as I was going to the bathroom.  I said, tell Sal to load a Nirvana song for the rejoin. 
[01:41:00]  Where's the intern?  Two minutes ago, you just said, you told me, but you told an intern to tell me.  There's a star witness, Sal.  Eric was telling the truth.  There's a star witness.  I believe it.  Crying a little eyes out about Sal.  This sounds suspiciously like the after show.  So, uh...  See, Rock, I stick up for you.  So, wait, now...  See what I just did?  Is the Rock lying?  No.  About Lloyd.  No, I just told you.  No, no, no.  I heard...  Get a Nirvana song.  I should have known when you said you were a witness, because if he would have said rejoiner, 
[01:41:30]  you might have said, hey, hey, hey.  Right.  Play the song.  Right.  What did the intern say to Sal when he delivered the message?  Can I play rejoin?  Eric said, play a rejoiner.  Oh, boy.  So, why would I deviate from that message?  And if you play the tape back, which helps my case here, I said, are we going to sing this  one?  Because I heard E-Rock go Nirvana's song.  Yeah.  Okay, what did the intern tell Sal, man?  Where's the intern?  Come here.  What did you tell Sal?  I said that Eric wants a Nirvana rejoiner.  Oh. 
[01:42:00]  Rejoiner?  The intern sucks.  Oh, man.  Well, the intern doesn't know yet.  So, they're...  Why are you playing telephone through a fucking intern, by the way?  Better so.  Why are there two different people running the same board is a better question.  Right.  I think if there's a board operator, it should be that person running the board.  I was going to the bathroom.  I was going to the bathroom.  Those big shits.  Go to the bathroom.  Of course you are, fucking Log's pizza problem.  Log's McGillicuddy.  Well, if that's the case, then that's okay, because I'm having a little bit of a pizza  problem myself.  Oh, damn.  I've got to stay away from pasta.  Number two on the day. 
[01:42:30]  Here's the problem.  A fucking order should not go through three people.  Right.  And how is it that we constantly address the issue that we don't like the loops being  played, yet they constantly are getting played?  They haven't been.  You think?  No, they have been.  They haven't.  They haven't.  Yes, they have.  They haven't.  This week they were.  Yes, they were.  Liar, liar, hoof on fire.  I've got to tell you, the Opster doesn't mind a loop every once in a while. 
[01:43:00]  I like when we mix it up.  Do a loop, and then every once in a while we do a song.  Was the Kiss song last break, was that a loop?  No.  No.  Okay.  See?  Okay.  Mix it up a little bit.  He just said...  Sometimes those loops are all right.  He just said, ever since your little bitch session a couple days ago, as if this is like  a new thing.  It's the 19th time we've told you we want regular songs.  I'm not paying close attention, but I think we're playing more loops than songs.  Since you guys discussed that.  We're playing more loops than we're doing talking non-stop. 
[01:43:30]  Loops get played a lot.  D-Rock's not right again.  Scott Shannon taught him how to do radio.  Yes.  There's a tree on my house.  There's a loop on my show.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  Tell the fat kids to play a loop.  I gotta go to the bathroom.  That fat niggle kid, gotta play a loop.  Tell the fat kids from Florida to play a loop.  Just play a loop. 
[01:44:00]  Pretty cool, huh?  What an idiot.  Yeah.  You think Obama likes Nirvana?  Uh, I think so.  Ooh, I gotta vote for Obama then.  Oh, man.  Oh, you don't think so, Travis?  Travis knows music better than me.  Oh, fuck Obama.  Mitt Romney for me.  Romney likes Obama.  I mean, oh, I'm sorry.  Romney hates Obama.  Late night at the stadium.  Oh, my God.  I'm so tired.  That stadium.  Wow.  There's something.  Oh, the Rich Voss thing.  Thank you.  So Rich Voss is going to be on ABC News tomorrow night. 
[01:44:30]  That's right.  What?  Part of that show.  I don't know.  This guy does this thing.  What would you do?  Or something like that.  Yep.  And they got Rich Voss comic.  Wait, I want to read the headline there.  Sure.  Oh, man.  It says, uh, comic takes insult, jokes too far, audience booze.  Oh, stop.  And it's a segment they do called What Would You Do?  Oh, right.  So they set something up.  Yes.  Right.  And then they, uh, put people...  Like you see a knife, a guy wielding a knife in the street.  What do you do?  Do you run away or you try to do something?  You know what I mean? 
[01:45:00]  That type of shit.  It's all set up.  And then they get people's natural reactions to see how, like, humans react in certain situations.  Do you know about this, Jimmy?  That Voss was doing this?  Yes.  So he purposely, uh, went hard after the audience?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  They picked the right guy.  Jesus.  Yeah, they couldn't have picked a fucking creepier asshole who wants to be on TV so desperately.  But you know what?  And it's got to be said, Voss knows how to work a crowd.  Yes, he does.  He's perfect for this segment.  He gets...  Trying to keep a little positivity going, people.  Just a little bit.  The Elf's just turning over a new leaf. 
[01:45:30]  Is this your girlfriend?  Jesus.  Did you meet her in NOM?  If a comic in a club took insult jokes...  She's not, like, from a service, like, you're paying for this?  Way too far.  There's two fat white chicks right here.  So would you stand up to the stand-up?  Oh, stop it!  Whoa, hold on.  Friday.  It's an hour so explosive.  No, no, you stink.  We almost couldn't break in fast enough.  My legs, hold on.  The question is...  Oh, man.  What would you do?  All new Friday at 9.  Ah, that asshole stops it just when it's getting good? 
[01:46:00]  Of course.  That's what I'm seeing.  I want to see some broads punch Voss in the face.  You see him, he goes, we couldn't get in there fast enough.  Yeah, yeah, to stop...  Let it happen!  To stop the fucking thing that's making it cool.  Right.  Yeah, Voss could handle himself.  He means just at a Voss show in general.  Oh, that's cool.  Good for Voss.  ABC News tomorrow night.  I don't even know when they show that.  What would you do?  I have no idea.  Yeah.  Is it a show or is it part of...  It's like a segment on...  What is it?  2020 or something?  2020 Nightline.  Fucking one of those. 
[01:46:30]  ABC.  It's not the Situation Room, right?  I think it's 2020.  Is it the Situation Room?  Oh, no.  It's not Wolf Blitzer's Situation Room.  It's not Wolf Blitzer.  It's not Chris Matthews yelling and screaming in that show?  No, it's...  What?  Chris Matthews playing a little hardball?  No, it's just called Chris Matthews yelling and screaming.  It's not Bill O'Reilly spinning everything?  No, it's the spin stops there right before you get to the show.  Does it?  Does it stop there?  It's the no spin zone?  Really?  Yeah.  He's fucking dizzy all the time.  Oh.  Yeah, from vertigo, that Bill O'Reilly.  He spins so much that he's like a top. 
[01:47:00]  By the way, did anyone see Bill O'Reilly and Jon Stewart doing the debate?  Yes.  You know Jon Stewart kicked his ass because Bill O'Reilly picked the wrong fucking venue  to discuss politics, right?  Yeah.  Did you see any of the clips?  Yeah, it was pretty douchey.  On whose part?  On O'Reilly's part.  He can't hang with Jon Stewart like that?  No, and he was trying to be like, you can't...  Oh, hi. 
[01:47:30]  What's up, Kevin?  Kevin Smith just came in.  I don't know if a lot of people saw it, but it was a debate.  Jon Stewart and...  I saw it.  Yeah.  Jon Stewart kicked his ass.  What?  You talking about Bill O'Reilly?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I mean, I wouldn't say that it was pre-planned what they were going to say,  but it didn't seem like, you know, who's going to take it?  Right.  It was more like, you do the dance.  But Bill O'Reilly had no business being in that arena with Jon Stewart.  Jon Stewart, slowly, I think, and I don't even think it's slow anymore, but I think 
[01:48:00]  everyone's discovering maybe the smartest man in America after George Carlin died, it  may be Jon Stewart.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, he's got great writers behind him on the show as well, but take him out of the  show.  If you ever watch him do an interview, he ain't got no writers behind him.  And he'll sit there across from, like, Larry King or Bill O'Reilly, and he's still  sharp as a tack.  Yeah, he's impressive to this day.  He used to do our show.  So, oh, man.  I did his show.  His show was the very first show I did back in 94 when we were promoting Clerks. 
[01:48:30]  He had, like, a show that was on, I want to say, like, WOR or...  Oh, yeah.  He did have, like, a talk show.  A long time ago, like, one season, and I was on it, and he brought out a Slurpee machine  because the movie was set in a convenience store.  But he was already, like, it was in the wind that this show was being canceled.  It was the only, like, TV show that would have made it.  And then he had a development deal with Letterman forever.  Did he?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, Letterman loved it.  Chasing Amy, man.  They wanted him in Chasing Amy.  When we were making Chasing Amy, I submitted the script. 
[01:49:00]  They said, who do you see in the movie?  And I said, I wrote it for my friends.  I wrote it for Affleck, Jason Lee, and Joey Adams.  And they were like, no, no, no.  I was told at that point the budget was $3 million.  Like, Kevin, this isn't about making movies with your friends.  And I was like, I'm going to try to spend my whole career disproving this.  But anyway, they said, I said, who do you guys see?  And they had holding deals with a lot of people at that point.  Oh, yeah.  So they were like Drew Barrymore, David Schwimmer, and Jon Stewart.  Wow.  And I was like, look, I like all those people, but I didn't write the movie for them. 
[01:49:30]  Wow, good for you.  Because those are big stars.  Yeah, well, I don't know, but I never got into it for that.  I say good for you because I think a lot of other guys would have been influenced and said,  all right, let's do it with Drew Barrymore.  And a lot of other guys' careers would be done at this point.  You don't know what to, you know, you really don't know what to do in certain circumstances  where you're just like, oh, my God, if this fucking backfires, but I still have my dignity.  That one was easy.  That one was so easy because the material was so, like, it was so personal.  I'd kind of gone through something like that with Joey Adams, who I was dating at the time 
[01:50:00]  that I wrote in it, written it.  So for me to go in and be like, all right, yeah, well, let's put Drew Barrymore in it.  Not for nothing.  And she was wonderful in E.T., but, you know, that was like fucking 30 years ago.  Exactly.  Or 20 at that point.  And it was just like, I don't know.  Is what E.T. is up to these days?  It's crazy.  Driving through drive-thrus sounding like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Is that really?  Yeah, it's amazing.  I said, it's for these cats.  I said, rather than spend $3 million, I asked Harvey Weinstein, I said, can you do me a favor?  I said, give me $200,000. 
[01:50:30]  I'll go off and make the movie we want to make.  We'll bring it to you.  So if you like it, you buy it.  If not, we'll just take it someplace else.  Wow.  Yeah.  But we did have Jon Stewart on the show.  But that was fucking forever ago.  And we blew it, because I think we had some kind of panty party or something instead of  fucking taking him seriously.  That was N.E.W.  Get out of here, really?  We had some kind of...  That was the good old N.E.W. days.  There was always some kind...  He hasn't had me.  I was on The Daily Show in 2001.  You haven't been back?  I haven't been back.  And I don't think it's because of this, but my crowning achievement was he was talking about acting, 
[01:51:00]  and I was like, I made some kind of joke about him being in the Elmo special.  He was on this Elmo DVD, Elmo Palooza, that my kid at that age watched incessantly day  in and day out.  So I got to rock a hand up the Elmo ass reference or something.  I'm pretty proud of that.  But then shortly after that, that show became even far more political than it was.  Pretty much the beast it is today.  And the only other time they were like, hey, do you want to be on the show?  It was after Southwest kicked me off.  No kidding.  Everybody, man. 
[01:51:30]  Letterman's like, come do the top ten.  Leno, of course.  I don't do Leno a lot, but they were like, come on and talk about it.  And The Daily Show was like, come out here.  But I was so sensitive at that point.  I was like, this is not a fucking joke.  We're on Syria.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not a fucking joke.  I have to reprogram my brain.  Wait, you didn't go on any shows?  I didn't.  Isn't that weird?  Like the biggest opportunity of my life, I imagine, publicity-wise.  It's a free fucking press, top of a Google news page for three days running, 5,000 articles  or something like that. 
[01:52:00]  And I never, and me, the guy who I whore like fucking nobody's business.  You know what I'm saying?  But that, for some reason, I was so like, this is, these two things will never meet.  Very personal.  It would have been like profiting off the death of a child at that point.  Now, in retrospect, I'm like, you idiot, man.  You could have channeled this into like, hi, I'm Kevin Smith, and I speak for Jet fucking  Blue or something like that.  Or a diet program sponsorship.  But all that shit was so sensitive, I just couldn't trade on it.  I smell something, though. 
[01:52:30]  I'm not sure.  It might be one of our interns.  I smell something.  It's not an unpleasant smell.  No, it's intense.  I'm an awake and baker.  I don't care what that is.  Oh, really?  This is what I was doing this morning, though, man.  Because, you know, everyone will tell you, give you a crap about, don't do blah, blah,  blah.  Man, I was reading, did you read the fucking story about Lance Armstrong?  No.  Oh, my God.  They just released the report.  Amazing.  I don't know if it was just released today, but I was reading the story.  The doping scandal was so far-reaching. 
[01:53:00]  It's insane.  Like, I remember, I'm not saying this dude did it to me in ha-ha, and he's always on his  own batard.  But this dude was shoved in my face, not by him, but by the media.  Like, look at this goddamn legend.  He beat Ball Cancer, and he won the Tour de France.  Who are you, you fat piece of shit?  For years, I was like, man, Lance Armstrong, if only I could beat that guy.  And then, in the report, they reveal, like, it's all fucking drugs.  Yeah.  All performance enhancement drugs.  And he denied it, denied it, denied it.  And now they have a, I guess he was going, like, I want to see the witnesses. 
[01:53:30]  And they presented him with a list of, like, 200 witnesses.  People that were close friends of his, teammates.  Listen to this opening.  This captured my imagination.  This is in the Tampa Bay Times, man.  Lance Armstrong said he wanted to see the names of his accusers, and the U.S. Anti-Doping  Agency gave him 26, including 11 former teammates.  Yeah.  Wow.  11 former teammates.  The world's most famous cyclist said he wanted to see the hard evidence he was a doper, and  the agency gave him that, too.  202 pages of vivid details from hotel rooms transformed into blood transfusion centers 
[01:54:00]  to the way Armstrong's then-wife rolled cortisone pills into foil and handed them out to the  cyclists along the way.  Why does he just admit it at this point?  That's what I'm saying.  Like, at this point, just be like, look, man.  I was trying to...  It's embarrassing.  I didn't want to admit that, like, I was a hero figure to a lot of people.  I didn't want to admit that I was...  He was trying to protect his legacy.  Exactly.  His legacy was shit, right?  No, I understand that, but, I mean, if you're him, you're going to still try.  Right now, he's Jim McGreevey walking out of a rest area.  Just say it.  But a lot of people say that the whole sport was doping. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, right.  The entire sport was doping.  Everyone on his team, I don't know about everybody, but in the article, it goes on to  detail, people that rode with him who were just like...  There's one guy who's like, look, I don't want to talk about anybody else, but I'm  compelled to here.  I wish I could just talk about myself.  He gave his first-person perspective, and he was just like, we had to.  This sport's so competitive, there's no way you reach there.  The place we did the Zenith, if you will, without performance enhancement drugs.  But in the report, it talks about how...  I didn't know this. 
[01:55:00]  There's a team?  Like, I guess he was on a team with other people?  I just thought...  I don't follow that sport, but I assumed it was a doping.  I know, it's a whole team, and they all have jobs and everything.  He insisted that everyone on the team dope as well, so that he could win.  Like, the quote they use in the report, man, this is what...  Wait, were the French doing it too, though, or no?  They say everybody in that sport.  He says, but everybody in cycling is involved.  Yeah.  Well, he didn't say it, the report did.  A lot of people are coming out and saying that's exactly what's going on.  I've got to find this one quote, what they said.  I keep talking, but I'll find, like, the report summed up by saying, like, not like, this 
[01:55:30]  guy is the biggest scumbag ever, but something like, it's clear that this dude would stop  at nothing.  Yeah, yeah.  He pretty much did admit to...  He didn't admit to it, but by saying, look, I'm not going to fight this, ban me from the  sport, you're pretty much saying, yeah, it's true, I'm not going to fight it.  So how many guys weren't doping?  Yeah, yeah.  If he was the best...  We'll figure that one out.  If everyone was doping and he was the best, that's pretty impressive.  Yeah, he's the best out of all the doping people. 
[01:56:00]  He and his teams were part of the most sophisticated, professionalized, and successful doping program  that sport has ever seen.  Wow.  Now, I don't know if that means that sport has ever seen, meaning cycling, or that  sport in general has ever seen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow, that's an accomplishment.  Right?  Like, that's a record.  There you go.  His whole career is a fraud, then, man.  Well, is it?  That's my question.  I know.  If the standard in the sport is that everybody's doping, then...  Well, you know what?  Lance needs to do. 
[01:56:30]  It's all relative.  I think I'm with Jimmy.  You admit it, and then you fucking blow the whistle, as they like to say.  Mea culpa.  Blow the whistle and say, really?  All right, all right, all right, I'm going to admit it, but now I'm going to fucking tell  you what has been going on in this sport forever.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  That's his only fucking car to play.  By now, though, he's just...  He's too far.  It's like Pete Rose with gambling.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Eventually...  Love Pete Rose.  I do, too.  You just got to own up to it.  You sort of did.  You sort of admitted a little bit, no?  Yeah, but you have to after all this time. 
[01:57:00]  Kristen was his ex-wife.  In one episode, Armstrong asks her to wrap banned cortisone pills in foil to hand out to  his teammates.  Kristen obliged Armstrong's request by wrapping the pills and handing them to the riders.  One of the riders remarked, Lance's wife is rolling joints.  That's in the report.  Wow.  Wow.  And he probably knew it's just too believable from too many sources.  Truth's on your side, bubba.  Nice.  Holy...  What a brilliant JFK poll that was. 
[01:57:30]  That's why I love Jimmy Norton.  That was fantastic.  That's why he bailed on the case.  Who?  Lance.  He finally just bailed.  Yeah, he knew.  Well, he said a couple weeks ago, he's like, I'm out of this.  You guys do what you want.  I know I'm innocent.  Because a lot of his fans are like, what the fuck are you doing?  And he's like, I just can't take the stress and the pressure anymore.  No, you're guilty.  Right.  Now, what happens to all the endorsements?  Do they go away?  Oh, fuck you.  They have to.  Really?  Yeah, man.  They don't think there's any energy drink that's like this, plus PDAs. 
[01:58:00]  Performance it has with drugs.  Yeah.  I think it goes away for a while, yeah.  But I think...  They've been saying it for years just because nobody is supposed to win that much.  Like, he fucking was...  Especially after cancer.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, this guy was a miracle.  But then, you sit there going, oh, you rock.  You sit there going, if he's a symbol, whether it's fake or not, to a bunch of people with  bald cancer, or cancer in general, who are like, man, if Lance Armstrong can do it.  Right, right. 
[01:58:30]  You know, was there good there?  Did something good come out of it?  Or ultimately, no, because it's all predicated.  Pretty much started.  False hope for fucking loose-sacked people.  I thought I could do it.  Well, you were wrong.  Sit down.  The way they talk about it, though, like, if you jack up with enough, would that cure  your...  Is that what they were insinuating?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  All I know is he was...  Because they said he spared no expense.  In the quote I was looking for, and I couldn't find him, sorry.  It said he spared nothing...  Spared no one and spared no expense whatsoever to reach... 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, because the money he was making on the other side, if he won the races, of course  he's going to spend a shitload of money.  It's sad because he was a hero to a lot of fucking people.  He was the wristband guy.  He was the wristband guy, Anthony.  Started the whole wristband thing.  The yellow fucking wristband.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that was the first wristband, right?  Yeah, that was pretty much the start of the whole thing.  That was him to live strong.  I've been saying he's doping, though, since after the second time he won, I've been saying  this is not a boy, Jimmy, but no one was listening.  You've been on it?  You're like the murder she wrote, man.  Yeah, exactly.  Nobody listens because you're this little old lady until there's...  He's doping, Sam.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  No way!  He could have won seven in a row, Sam!  Now take those tiny Asian genitals and put them in my mouth.  Mr. Monaghan says, you're dope.  Yeah.  It looks like the scales of justice.  One half of the sack's got something, and the other one's down here, Sam.  It's empty.  I have not been here since the edition of the theme music.  Oh, yeah, really?  That is an excellent fall.  It takes how suddenly I'm eight years old going, like, do I have to watch this? 
[02:00:00]  Aren't there any cartoons on?  Exactly!  I hated that show so much.  Oh, it was terrible.  I loved it.  It taught me a lot.  It was realistic.  A forensic pathologist always fucks the hot blonde after the car chase.  In a members-only jacket and slacks.  He's involved in car chases, shootings.  They're going over the cliff and fucking...  It's not your job, Quince.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is Quincy doing that?  He's a medical examiner.  Jack Klugman's mom.  No, he's still alive.  He's still alive.  Has he ever been on a CSI?  I don't know.  Don't you think they should honor the original? 
[02:00:30]  No kidding.  The original forensics expert?  Even if it's just a quick little, yeah, little thing.  Oh, my God.  He's got, like, throat cancer and shit, so he can't really talk.  Yeah.  It's kind of...  He could play the body.  That's true.  Just to be like, come on.  They pull it back and it's Quincy.  And it's Quincy.  Oh, he was a good doctor once.  I knew this guy.  That's great.  Oh, God.  How great was that being?  I'm ready to roll a tear, man.  That's like that.  To kill off Quincy like that.  Continuity?  To pull those worlds together?  That would be amazing.  Hollywood should do more of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you have fucking Detective Monaghan come in and go, yeah, Quince. 
[02:01:00]  I mean, who knew he was a pederast?  For no reason at all.  You just completely destroyed his character in one fucking quick snippet.  Yeah, and then Sam comes in and he's fucking with a lady boy.  It's never explained.  They did one of those extensions of something on Hawaii Five-0 recently.  The new Hawaii Five-0.  Yeah, they brought back an old enemy of McGarrett's.  Yeah, it was, what's his name? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, but it was Lou Grant.  Oh, Lou.  Ed Asner.  I love Ed Asner.  Ed Asner.  Had he been on the OG?  He was on the OG.  Fucking Hawaii Five-0.  And they brought him back?  So, yeah, they brought him back as the same character.  What is the continuity of that show?  Is anybody there supposed to be McGarrett?  Like McGarrett's fucking nephew or something?  Is it?  I have no idea.  No clue.  I can't believe it's on, though.  They went for another season.  They're doing all right.  They're still doing it.  A show that the first casualty of the fall season made in Jersey.  Which one?  It was a show called Made in Jersey. 
[02:02:00]  Made in Jersey.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was a show about a Jersey girl who was a lawyer in New York because she played by a British  lady or something like that.  Oh, yuck.  I just want to see a show about a female lawyer.  I'm going to win this case.  All right.  Well, sure you are.  Enough of the lawyers.  Has Jersey been the setting of a successful TV show?  What would Quincy say to a female lawyer?  You're never going to win because you have ovaries.  All of your reason slips out between those two puffy lips.  Now, my young houseboy, Sam. 
[02:02:30]  Sam's setting off firecrackers in his houseboat.  Burn your law degree and come on my boat.  I'll massage your flat ass while we breathe in gas fuels.  His name's Cosmo.  Oh, yeah.  Jesse's girl.  I'm so jealous.  His name's God.  Yeah.  His name's Sam.  He sets off firecrackers.  Firecrackers in my house. 
[02:03:00]  Quincy Nights.  Quincy's giant dick.  Yeah.  Detective Monaghan is going to test the cocaine.  That's great.  I used to watch that as a kid, though.  My mom would always have it on.  And just at the beginning, it was like the da-da-da-da-da.  And it's like, oh, it's serious.  And then the...  Now it's goopy.  He gets laid and this guy likes to drink.  Somebody's dead. 
[02:03:30]  I'm with some chicks.  Casual quints.  Casual quints.  Casual quints.  Because he had come from fucking the odd couple.  So you knew him as funny Oscar Madison.  You can't just get him all serious.  You got to kind of have a little wacky.  And they show him running his finger over the body on the gurney or something like that.  And they did that a couple of times to throw you off.  And then he's doing it again.  And they pull back.  And he's with the broad on the boat within the bikini.  And he's just being creepy with her.  He's way out of his league. 
[02:04:00]  Prodding and poking her.  So out of his league.  Yeah.  She was like an eight and a half.  But they don't show you that she's actually dead.  And they don't show you that it's a skeleton face in the front.  He brought his work home to fucking...  Exactly.  I wanted to analyze her.  She had a figure in her anus.  He's a necrophilia.  He would smell the vagina and anus of cadavers.  Which would tell him how they died.  She choked on pea soup.  Oh my god.  Oh shit. 
[02:04:30]  When you watch shows from that period now, you never believe that people watched them  and actually thought there was any beat of realism to it.  Like who watched this garbage and thought...  Options, dude.  There were no options.  No options.  Three channels.  Think about how many CSIs there are.  There was one forensic show and it was Quincy.  One forensic show.  Quincy.  We had nothing else to base anything on.  And we never had like HBO to watch Michael Bodden fucking talk about what it really is to 
[02:05:00]  be a...  What a ghoul that guy is.  ...a fucking medical examiner.  So yeah, what did we know?  Oh yeah, I guess he goes around and fucking gets involved with the police and the car checks  him as well.  Yeah.  It taught a generation of kids like, you can do this creepy job and still get pussy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No matter how old you are.  How many guys went into that and didn't get the pussy?  Like, what the fuck, Quince?  Why did it work for Jack Quince?  All those shows.  There's that network, ME, MeTV, and it's kind of like retro television from the 70s and  shit like that. 
[02:05:30]  And I was just getting into, day after day, I'd come home and just pop on, fucking Cannon  would come on.  Cannon!  A Quinn Martin production.  And it was so ridiculous.  And I remember watching it as a kid and my parents would be watching it and really getting  into it.  Like, wow, this is serious drama.  And you watch it now, it's like, this is so hokey.  And they're ham-handed attempts at a message.  Right.  And it was like a Vietnam message or some shit, you know?  Perhaps we should get out of there.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get out of here, Cannon. 
[02:06:00]  Cannon!  A Quinn Martin production.  And they used to yell at the announcer, with special guest star, Lauren Bacall.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, um...  This theme song, we borrowed from that theme song for, we did a show over the summer called  Spoilers.  And it was a movie review show where we take people out to the movies and we sit around  and talk about it afterwards.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  And we did the theme song and the opening credits was based on Cannon. 
[02:06:30]  Cannon.  Where they just have the dots with, like, his ear.  Why the fuck are they the side of his head?  Because he's listening.  Because what else could you show?  That's true.  That was sexy, dude.  That was sexy, yeah.  He had a giant car.  He was.  That's when they used to put, like, fat people on TV.  Unattracted people.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Unattracted people.  All the family.  Yeah.  The Jeffersons.  MASH.  I mean, you know, all right, they were serviceable looking.  Right, right.  But there was no beautiful people because the shows were written by people who didn't grow 
[02:07:00]  up in a television generation.  Yes, yes.  Like Norman Lear.  They were real people and they had real experiences.  This unattainable good looks that are on TV and movies now is so ridiculous.  But, yeah, then it was just, hey, you know, this guy's fucking pretty big dude, but just  had to be funny.  William Conrad.  Or he curated or something back in the days.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like they had one way to kind of measure your popularity and that was it.  Like, now in this day and age, people will be like, you're not getting past the pilot  cannon.  Yeah, cannon. 
[02:07:30]  You better drop some fucking pounds.  What is this guy doing?  He's supposed to be chasing someone through the woods?  It's true, man.  That was a dude you could easily get away from each and every time.  Every time, though, he'd get in a fight and he'd karate chop someone.  That's a dude you could come past to his face and be like, I did it, Cannon.  What are you going to do?  And just step back when he reaches for you.  Step back.  He's like, you can't get me.  He would be running through the woods with a snub-nosed .38 at the hip shooting and hit  people.  Why did he shoot that way?  From like 100 yards.  Did they used to shoot that way?  No.  It's crazy.  It's just a little cooler for TV. 
[02:08:00]  With his fucking half-inch barrel on a snub-nosed .38.  I think that's as high as he could raise it.  Yeah, yeah.  He couldn't raise it.  He was a real Chief Wiggum type.  I just read somewhere that Roger Moore never did his own shooting on any of the James  Bond movies.  Really?  Yeah.  He says he couldn't fire a gun without flinching, so there was always a double.  Wow.  Anytime James Bond fired a gun, apparently there was a double.  Well, he's coming in.  Otherwise, you would see him going like this.  Ask him.  Well, ask him.  Ask him.  How old's Roger Moore now, do you think? 
[02:08:30]  He's up there, man.  He's got the 80s.  He's got the 80s.  He's got the 80s.  I just saw that Bond documentary.  He was interviewed in it.  Epic's doing it.  Yeah.  How is it?  It's great.  I had no desire to see it, but I love Epic, so I went to the premiere.  I'm dying to see every James Bond movie right now.  I'm literally, it turned me completely around.  I like Daniel Craig a lot, but I want to go see all of them.  Roger Moore was good at the beginning, the first couple that he did, and then it just  started getting so hokey.  Like, every joke, it became a parody. 
[02:09:00]  He really started leaning into the comedy a lot more.  It became kind of like the Batman Forever and Batman and Robin of the James Bond universe.  Yep.  Yep.  They just, like, people liked, what's his name, Richard Keel as Jaws, and the character  was in one flick.  People, they responded.  They brought him back again.  You thought he died in space, I believe.  Then they brought him back.  They kept bringing the dude back.  Yeah, yeah.  There was the ones like, the Spy Loved Me was good.  Yeah, and then you're going underwater with a car. 
[02:09:30]  But then it was like Octopussy and fucking, uh...  Which sounded sexier than it was.  Yeah.  It's like, come see Octopussy.  Moonraker.  Eight pussies.  Moonraker.  Eight complainers.  Moonraker was the one with the space shuttles and stuff like that.  What was the best Bond flick, you think?  God.  It's the...  A lot of people would say a Sean Connery one.  People love the Connery Bond.  What was that one?  The lady with the gun hat?  Or the man with the umbrella flight? 
[02:10:00]  Or, uh...  Man with a golden gun.  No, Lonely Heart Shoes.  All these fucking things I can't remember.  I like...  There was one that, uh, what's his name, did...  Sean Connery did called Never Say Never Again.  He hadn't been Bond in, like, 10, 15, 20 years or something.  Right, yeah, yeah.  And he came back and did it as a middle-aged Bond.  And it was actually a pretty tight flick, and Kim Basinger's in it.  And it's, like, at the early days of video games.  So movies are just, like, video games can do these amazing things.  So instead of, like, playing Pong or something on a screen, 
[02:10:30]  or maybe, let's say, at that point, Donkey Kong was, like, all the rage.  At one point, he's sitting across from another billionaire at this long table.  Looks like a Chippendale dining table.  And there's controls built under it.  And it's, like, this global thermonuclear war game.  Oh, yes.  There is a three-dimensional representation, like a holograph.  You think it's going to be Tupac or something at the concert.  But this is going back 25 years.  And they're playing this video game.  And as a kid, you're going, this is bullshit.  Nobody has this game.  This don't exist. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, it looks like Princess Leia talking to R2-D2.  Yeah, yeah.  That little projected hologram version.  But that was one of the first, like, references to video games in mainstream.  Yeah, yeah.  Then they started putting a lot of video games in movies because it was all the rage at the time.  War games.  Yeah, war games.  Good old war games.  What was that?  I think there was a...  War games taught us to connect to the internet long before the connect to the internet.  Like, in 1982, he had a modem.  Yeah, yeah.  And he would stick his phone into it. 
[02:11:30]  There was a plastic modem where you had to put the fucking handset in there.  Right into it to connect with the noise.  To connect with the fucking...  But I remember, like, years later, like, ten years later, maybe, something like that,  finally going online and having to...  And this is dial-up days.  Yeah, yeah.  And you would hear that same noise from war games.  And you were like, oh, my God.  War games could happen.  I'm in.  Here's what I learned from war games.  I always wondered what Dabney Coleman did after his job at 9 to 5 ended.  He went and ran the war room.  Yes.  That's right.  Big old sack of shit.  Hell, I'd piss on a spark plug. 
[02:12:00]  I thought it would help.  Let the boy in there, Major.  Yeah.  Let's unplug the goddamn thing.  Yes.  The whopper.  Let the boy in there.  And I love the way he's, hello, Joshua.  Joshua.  Greetings, Professor Falcons.  Yes.  I like the fact...  Shall we play a game?  Yeah.  I like the fact that the machine learned a lesson.  Yes.  Instead of just coming back...  Not mankind.  The machine.  The machine learned the lesson.  The machine learned the lesson.  Tic-tac-toe blows.  That's what he should have done.  And then set the missiles off.  You people should be killed for inventing this faggoty game. 
[02:12:30]  X-O-X-O.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Kevin, why are you in town, by the way?  This weekend is the New York Comic Con, sir.  Yeah, that's right.  Comic Con.  So I'm here for that.  Very cool.  Friday, we've got a panel during the day at the Comic Con.  It's 2.45 to 3.45 for Comic Book Men.  Yes.  Our show comes back this weekend on Sunday.  So I'm here for New York Comic Con to kind of promote that.  And then on Friday night, me and the guys who do Comic Book Men do a podcast called The  Secret Stash, which is kind of the X-rated version of the show. 
[02:13:00]  You do a lot of podcasts.  Lots.  You're a fucking animal, dude.  You're really always doing something.  How many hours a day are you podcasting now?  I don't know.  Not really.  There are long blocks that I don't.  But when I sit down to do it, we talk for like multiple hours.  Yeah.  And then I break it up into a few.  But, you know, there's four different shows, five different shows a week.  But it's no different than you guys.  You guys get on the radio five days a week.  You do four hours and change.  What's the difference?  Yeah, yeah.  If it was a podcast, we'd have a lot of podcasts.  We're not making movies, too, though.  Neither am I, though. 
[02:13:30]  I'm trying to be you guys.  Hey, is any of this coming into play yet with the podcast?  The lolly, if you will?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's untraditional.  Don't need details, but untraditional.  I'll totally give you the details because a lot of people are like, where's the money?  Because we're all waiting for the money.  Well, and that's the thing.  In the podcast world.  The people waiting for the money are going to be sorely disappointed for a long time.  And if you're looking for the money, that ain't the reason to do it.  You've got to be creative on how you get your money.  The reason to podcast is just because you've got something to say and you never had a place  to say it before.  Now you have a platform and you've listened to morning radio your whole life and you're 
[02:14:00]  just like, I like to talk with my friends or even just by myself.  And so, boom, you generate your own show and maybe it's not playing to millions or maybe  it is.  That's the beauty of the internet.  Yeah, yeah.  So anybody could do that.  Now, the people that go, I want to do that because I need to say something.  That's who I think the medium belongs to.  People who'd never had a voice for it.  The people who are like, how do I make money off this right away?  You're fucked.  Yeah.  It's just like you don't get it.  Don't do it for the moolah. 
[02:14:30]  Just like I want to hit it up a little bit.  Do it for the love of you.  Quincy it, man.  Yeah.  That's what Quincy said.  Quincy would probably say, it's not about the money, Sam.  It's about teaching people the dangers of drugs.  I'm going to do a podcast from my houseboat.  I'm going to call it Rape on the High Seas.  I'll hit him with a pipe right across the jawline.  Why can't it be a guy?  Let it be a guy.  Let's hit with the pipe.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  I'm going to rape my boss with the mustache. 
[02:15:00]  I don't remember his name, but I'm going to rape his mouth.  I wonder if he hated other fucking doctor shows.  What about Trapper John?  He's a war criminal.  He raped a child in Korea.  Wow.  That was no accident.  It was murder.  Why do you think they call him Trapper?  Because he trapped that little girl.  Trapper in the jungle.  Hey, you guys, get out of there. 
[02:15:30]  We got one phone call for Kevin today.  Bob.  Bob?  Hey there, Bab.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Good, good.  What do you got for Kevin Smith?  Question, Kevin.  What is the most valuable comic book that you own?  Good question.  That I own?  I'm not really that guy, man.  When I sold my collection to make Clerks years back, I never really went back and said,  oh, I'm going to buy big books.  I never bought an expensive title.  I figure if I can read them digitally, why am I going to spend millions of dollars on a comic book 
[02:16:00]  that you don't open that often?  You're never really going to share with other people.  I met Brett Ratner.  He had Action Comics No. 1, one of the most expensive comics in the world for his appearance  of Superman.  What kind of condition is Brett's in?  Pretty nice.  And he has it hanging on in one of those kind of frames where it looks like it's floating.  But he said he takes it out, or at least took it out and read it once or something like that.  Did he?  But when he said how much it was, and it was up there.  That's huge.  I was just like, you could buy a store for that.  Once I bought a comic book store, then I was like, I don't really need a collection anymore 
[02:16:30]  because now I have a collection that everybody's picking out of and stuff.  But I was not that guy.  The most expensive comic book I ever had was a giant-sized X-Men annual, and this was  way back in the day, like way pre-Clerks even, like $89.90 or something.  It was like a $200 book at the time.  Now it's probably, I don't know, maybe $400, $500 or something.  So you're not a collector in general?  I'm more of a reader, but I'm not like, I've got to get key issues.  I mean, I'll get key issues to read, but the stuff that I used to like to read wasn't 
[02:17:00]  like golden or silver.  Not collectible, yeah.  But what's the most valuable thing you own as far as a collectible goes, if you want  to say?  Yeah, I'm just trying to think.  I mean, it's weird, but I don't buy other people's crap.  I buy collectibles of art crap.  There's a dude in Philadelphia who does these amazing bronze sculptures of characters from  movies, did them for Pulp Fiction, did a lot for Quentin.  I first saw him at a Comic-Con years ago.  They were just on display.  I was like, gorgeous caricatures this big of characters or scenes from the movie done 
[02:17:30]  in bronze.  So I'd seen the ones he did for Quentin for Pulp.  I'd seen some he did for Robert Rodriguez.  And after Dogma, this dude cold called me, sent me, well, I mean, I have a call.  He sent me a letter with pictures of Ben and Matt from Dogma.  It's done in that style.  It was in clay.  It wasn't bronze yet.  But I recognized the dude, Cleet Shields, his name, recognized his work right away.  And I was like, oh my, dude, I saw the, it's like, not these, but stuff looked like this 
[02:18:00]  at Comic-Con, like back in 95.  This is genius.  I was like, yes, I want one.  So that kind of stuff I put money into.  Like the Ben and Matt statue stands about, what would this be?  Maybe three feet or something?  Two feet?  A couple of feet.  Two feet.  It's pretty heavy.  It's made of bronze.  And something like that will go for like eight grand or something.  Now that I could see putting the money into because I'm like, I made that fucking movie  or something like that.  Right, right.  And then he did like a series, like he did a George Carlin.  So I would make two and keep one for myself and give one to the other person. 
[02:18:30]  So Carlin, I gave one to.  Chris Rock, I gave one to.  Oh, wow.  Ben and Matt, I each gave them sets as well.  The only one I never gave one to was Jason Mewes because at the time he was so fucking jacked  up on heroin and oxys.  He'd have sold it.  He'd have sold it.  And I told him, I was like, dude, the moment you're clean for a long stretch of time, I'll  make you one of these bronze statues.  But until then, man, I give it to you.  You're going to give it to somebody for a fucking time bag or something.  And some fucking dealer's going to have it in his house.  Right.  And be like, look at this, man.  It's Jay and Silly Bob.  Tell me a story about how I got this. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  The guy who played Jay sucked my dick.  I asked him, I was like, dude, how close did you ever get at your worst?  Oh, man.  And he's like, I always had the presence of mind to like, if I got anywhere close to that,  then he's like, I would have went looking for help or something like that.  Yeah.  I was like, come on, dude.  It's between us.  Nobody's around.  So he's like, no, never even got close.  Never got close to sucking dick for fucking drugs.  I never did it for drugs.  Oh, not for drugs.  Why Sully sucking dick with drugs? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, it was something like that.  Yes.  And so why bring sand to the beach?  Friday night, man, I'm going to be at the Gramercy doing that show.  Nice.  At 10 o'clock at night, I think it is.  Me, Brian Johnson, Walter Flanagan, Ming, and Mike, the guys from Comic Book Men.  And it'll be a pretty fun show.  I didn't finish that before, my bad.  Oh, no worries.  Yes, yes.  You're not the only Comic-Con person we have today.  Who else?  Oh, I don't.  Mr. Tabert. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yes, yes.  He lost me.  He knows.  He knows.  You know, Kevin.  He knows.  We were talking about who, what character this person is in.  This guy's most famous for.  He's most famous for.  He says, Mr. Tabert, by far.  I'd say it's probably the guy that says, it's not your goddamn planet, monkey boy.  You think?  No, I don't know.  No, that for me, that was my first kind of like, oh, popped on my radar.  No, Mr. Tabert is absolutely, it begins and ends in 1975.  Doc Brown.  Motherfucker. 
[02:20:30]  Doc Brown.  Everybody knows that.  Nope.  Doc Brown.  We're going to talk to Chris Verloy.  What about Jim?  I can't believe nobody went for like a show.  Jimmy Gatowski?  Sure.  I'm going to say to him, what were you doing?  What were you doing when she said, are you taking Jim's medication to Mr. Seafeld?  I'm going to ask him all these dumb questions.  Did you and Ben Sheeney ever eat after the show together?  After they're shooting?  Wow, he's coming in?  Yeah, in a few minutes.  Are you sticking around or what? 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, we might, man.  Come on.  He's here at 9.15.  That's fucking great.  We should break and we'll talk.  Take a break and then you fucking hang him.  You should hang.  Has he ever been before?  No.  I don't think.  We've talked to him on the phone, I think.  Is that where he was?  He also lost his house in a fire.  He lost everything.  Yeah, I remember that.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, if he lost like a bunch of fucking memorabilia.  Should we bring that up, you think?  Yeah, I mean, it's a point in an interview.  What does he ask about?  Maybe Sam should.  It's been a few years as well.  Yeah, how has he moved on?  That's a terrible...  Kareem had the same thing happen to him.  You know, he lost everything.  I mean, fucking millions of dollars. 
[02:21:30]  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?  Yeah, years ago.  Kevin Smith was here for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  That's right.  He was one of the most soft-spoken, politest human beings I've ever met in my life.  And not to mention tall, of course.  Yeah, he made us all sad.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he was getting yelled at by the publicist.  Thank you.  Kevin Smith to back us up.  The publicist was just like, we found out right afterwards, was yelling at him, like,  don't only talk about this.  And we're like, he's a legend.  I'm like, it's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  You don't talk to Kareem like that.  She's a monster.  Like that.  She's a monster.  We were also trying to loosen him up, make him giggle and stuff. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And the few moments that he did, she was just like, shut up.  Oh, God.  She was screaming.  What a smile.  Bitch.  Yeah.  We met two basketball legends that made me sad.  But Kareem and Dr. J was...  Dr. J.  Why did he make you sad?  Because he came in and his shirt was a little tired.  You know, he's not making the same money.  And he never really made the money.  What was the shirt, though?  It's just, you could tell it was a style that might be past its time a little bit.  Like from the oak tree or something like that?  Yeah.  It was just like...  Structure?  You expect Dr. J to be like, just in the solid clothes and... 
[02:22:30]  I don't know.  And then he's married to someone that doesn't even really know what he did for a living.  She knows of it but doesn't really care.  Right.  And he said that he doesn't have any of his basketball stuff around his house.  Remember all that?  Yeah.  He was cool as all hell, but...  Guys like that, man.  Remember kids in the commercial?  Dr. J.  Dr. J.  He was...  There was no one bigger than Dr. J in the NBA for a long, long time.  And to think that he's kind of maybe not making a lot of money is kind of sad. 
[02:23:00]  I was not a basketball fan.  Never have been.  But even I was aware of Dr. J as a kid.  There were some of those names that just transcended your interest in the sport.  And that's one of them, definitely.  Lance Armstrong.  He was the Lance...  For me, a Lance Armstrong of basketball where it's like, I don't know this sport, but I know this dude.  You fucking...  Yeah.  Who thought you'd ever know anybody in bicycling?  You know?  That really shows you like...  But that's the thing.  Like, the dude found a niche where nobody else...  Yeah.  You know, he could be the bike guy.  He could run... 
[02:23:30]  Just like Gretzky became the face of hockey in America.  This guy was like, I'm a face of cycling now.  Yeah.  Can I tell you?  I hate cycling enthusiasts.  Enthusiasts.  I detest cycling enthusiasts.  People that watch biking or people that are biking.  Whatever.  Just the fact that they consider themselves cycling enthusiasts.  Then you should go to Central Park.  Oh, they put the uniforms on and everything.  They got like the tight fucking...  Yeah.  They all look like Lance Armstrong and they race around the park.  They should hand out fucking sticks.  Perfect for Spoke Jen.  Hey, Jen, this is the spokesman. 
[02:24:00]  That was one of the most horrific things that could happen to you as a kid on a bike.  Was someone throwing a stick in your front spokes.  Yes.  That was rare.  You always heard about it.  It was rare, but just the thought of it was...  It was right up there with when you were a kid.  People were like, don't ever get punched in the nose.  It's because they could put the fucking bone into your brain and you will instantly die.  Worst with the bikes was the pant leg.  Pant leg and the chain.  Holy crap.  How many times are you on the side of the road trying to lift the bike up and spin the pedal  to get your pant leg out of the chain? 
[02:24:30]  Man, that would make you fucking crash a bike.  Here you go, kids.  Here's something with moving gears and levers.  I know.  It really is.  Shit you could get cut on.  A weird thing to give a kid.  There was also people that would ride either on the handlebars or on the back and get their  foot stuck in the spokes.  I was one of the back.  That was a bad fucking injury.  I rode on the back of a bike.  I was more of a walker.  I never liked riding on the bike with anybody.  Oh, God, no.  You get on the handlebars.  Fuck you.  Nobody ever says get on the handlebars to the fat kid.  That never happens. 
[02:25:00]  We had people that had bikes with not quite basket baskets, but they had the front kind of  space, and after E.T., everybody tried to jack the littlest guy in the group into the  basket in the front of the bike, which was kind of weird.  You were a walking guy, though?  Yeah, yeah, much more.  I still, to this day, like I go every day, well, not now that I'm on the road, but I'll  wake up, and there's a hill.  We live in the hills, and so you step out the door.  You either go down, it's easy, or the moment you take a left, you're walking up a pretty 
[02:25:30]  steep hill.  So I do that.  It's like a mile and a half every day.  I think that's the only thing that's kept me alive.  And then I was almost put off that by, this is fucked up, man.  Coyotes?  No, but you see those all the time.  Yeah, I used to fucking hike in L.A.  It's fucking scary.  It's crazy.  I saw the signs one time, the mountain lions.  I saw the signs on the way out once.  I'm like, wow, I probably should have read that before.  I would have been...  Maybe it was a good idea.  Coyotes.  I've never seen the mountain lions yet.  They warn you about the mountain lions.  Fucking mountain lions.  Those are sneaky fucks. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  And you hear the coyotes, man, during the night because they'll grab a cat or a dog  and they travel like one hits and then they all come in.  And so they sound like hyenas.  Like you'll just be sitting there and quietly, you know, there's a quiet outside.  And we live like a few blocks off of Hollywood Boulevard, so it should be loud, but it's not  because we're nestled in these hills.  All of a sudden you just hear, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah,  a cacophony of it, man, and you hear something shrieking and dying.  Wow.  And you're like, I guess they got a cat.  Oh, God.  Pretty, pretty mean. 
[02:26:30]  But I didn't...  It wasn't a coyote, man.  I was walking with my dog.  I got a little doction, man, a little miniature wiener dog.  So right away, fat guy and a little dog is a funny sight.  So I like the route I walk, no traffic, very few cars.  Like a lot of people go to Runyon Canyon to walk, and that's a real fucking scene and stuff.  You'll see famous people and shit.  But it's pretty...  I'll be honest, it's a tough walk.  I don't think I've ever made it up that hill.  So I walk the one near my neighborhood because it interweaves through side streets.  You don't really see anybody. 
[02:27:00]  I'm walking the dog and sweating like a pig, man, and this car drives past me.  And, you know, you always try to stay aware of you, especially on a street where there's  not a lot of traffic.  Yeah, yeah.  You tend to notice every car and stuff.  And sometimes you're just playing spy, you know, where you're just like, this motherfucker's  after me.  And then sometimes it turns out to be right.  Like, this car drives past, and then I noticed it, didn't think about it, kept walking with  the dog, then it drove by again.  Oh, shit.  Now you're like, oh.  So I was like, maybe they went to their friend's house up the hill, then it came back.  Then it came by a third time.  I was like, all right, I've been made, man. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So is it fan or what?  You know, what's it going to be?  Like, if it's fan, great.  I'm just worried about the day.  Religious zealot.  Sure.  Not a fan who's just like, he's alone with a little dog as a weapon.  Let's get him.  Oh, man.  So it drives past, again, the fourth time.  So I see it heading down to the end of the street, and you can either go right or left,  and its brake lights go on.  So I kind of duck into a little, like, it's got some archways on their houses on the street.  They descend into the hill.  So there's a little, like, archway thing. 
[02:28:00]  So I'm standing under it, feeling like a dick, because I'm like, this isn't about me.  Like, why am I, you know, now I'm taking playing spy to the 10th degree, and I'm like, now you've  literally stopped walking.  It's not in your head, and you've physically responded to something.  You don't even know what it is, dude.  But I'm standing there, I'm just, you get a sixth sense sometimes, or a sixth sense or  whatever they call it.  And then, so I look out, and I see that the car is parked ahead at the end of the street  in a place where cars never park.  It's a yellow curb, and it's a rounded corner, so nobody parks. 
[02:28:30]  So I walk past this house all the time, their cars are normally in the driveway, nobody parks  here, and it's the same car.  Oh, boy.  So I was like, all right, fuck it, I've been made, serious.  I don't know what's going on, but I'm trying to make myself as presentable as possible,  considering I'm a fat, sweaty mess.  Wearing fucking, like, a big old sweatshirt and shit, sweat pouring on my face, my hair  all matted, because, again, I've just walked a mile up a hill.  Now I'm walking down.  So I throw my hair up and stuff, start walking with the dog, walking toward the car. 
[02:29:00]  Nobody's in the front seat.  So I'm like, you're acting like a fucking dick.  Oh, man.  But then I'm like, you know what?  I can't quite see into the back seat.  So as I'm walking close to the car, I was like, just do it.  One of two things to do, keep going or confront.  And I said, fuck it, do it.  So I just walk up to the car, man, walk up to the back seat, driver's side window, and I wave.  And at this point, like, I'm like, I could look like the biggest dick in the world to everybody. 
[02:29:30]  But then the window goes down.  And there is a motherfucker with the longest telephoto lens I've ever seen in my life,  tented in a duveteen.  He duveteened his back seat.  Duveteen is the stuff you hang up on movies.  I don't know if they use it elsewhere in life, but that's the only place I know it from.  You hang it up to darken rooms in movies and shit like that.  He created a little tent affair for himself in his back seat.  All manner of snacks, all manner of fucking drinks.  Staking out as long as he wants, right?  And this camera was fucking threatening looking, man. 
[02:30:00]  It looked like a high-powered rifle.  But not like I didn't confuse it as such, but it's just like, Jesus, you really want the shot.  So he goes, hi.  And I was like, dude, you can't do this.  I was about to call Jason Mews.  He lives down the hill.  And that dude would have come up, ripped you out of the car, and put a pool stick up your ass.  Because you drove past four times.  He goes, I know I'm a huge fan.  I was like, well, stop and say hi.  You can get killed this way, man.  And he goes, oh, I'm sorry.  He goes, can I take a picture with you?  And I said, yeah, totally.  Come on out.  He comes out. 
[02:30:30]  He takes out his iPhone to take the picture, not the other picture.  Totally.  He takes the iPhone shot.  And I go, all right, man.  Remember, don't fucking stalk people.  Just say hi and move on and shit.  And he goes, you mind if I take a few pictures of you while you're walking away?  And I was like, okay, let's have the conversation.  I said, look, dude, you know how much it takes for me to get off my fat ass in the morning  and walk up this fucking hill?  Like, it's moving heaven and earth, dude.  Like, my body screams to just sit there, smoke weed, and do nothing.  But for me to get up the hill takes everything I am. 
[02:31:00]  If I see pictures of myself walking up this fucking hill, walking downhill, looking like  a fat piece of shit, I ain't going to walk up this hill anymore.  And I don't walk running, so then I'm just going to get fatter and die.  Now, if you're a fan, you don't want that.  He goes, I feel you.  I feel you.  Thanks for explaining that.  I said, do me a favor.  I drop a bunch of weight, throw up all the pictures of my fat ass you want.  I said, but while I'm trying to do something, please, don't fucking share pictures with  the world.  Don't take pictures of me walking away with my dog.  And he goes, okay, okay.  Good meeting you, man.  And give me his card. 
[02:31:30]  It was the weirdest, creepiest experience.  And it's because you handled it nicely, though.  That's probably why the paparazzi, and obviously you never posted any pictures.  I haven't seen him anywhere.  That's awesome.  To his credit.  Do we have to break?  Yeah, we really do, actually.  Because Christopher Lloyd's coming in.  Kevin Smith.  Sorry, I'm rambling.  No, no, no.  It was a good story.  Kevin Smith is here.  Christopher Lloyd is next.  And we got Kirk Hammett from Metallica still on the way.  Yes.  Very busy show.  Time for piss.  Oh, now he does the song when we need to do the rejoiner. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, what are you doing?  He gets confused.  Because we got the guys walking in.  And you can't have the song playing.  So we got to get right into it.  Busy day.  Kevin Smith in the studio.  Jim.  And now Christopher Lloyd in the studio.  Christopher Lloyd.  Take a seat.  Make yourself comfy.  Good morning, sir.  We're on the air, as they say in this biz.  Uh-huh.  How are you, sir?  Okay.  How are you?  Good, right?  My God.  Got you coffee.  Is this early for you? 
[02:32:30]  So-so.  So-so?  Yeah.  Not like a, not a normal early guy.  I'm not.  I got to do this crap every day.  And I like sleep.  I'm good like that.  What are you, uh, you're going to be at the Comic-Con?  Yeah, I'll be there.  All right.  Would you pull that mic a little closer?  Okay.  Sir.  You unfortunately get a room full of people who are just like, it's you!  I know.  We're all like, ah!  Maybe you can clear something up for us.  Because we're trying to figure out your most famous role.  I already know what it is.  Uh-huh.  They're, they're, they're insisting, uh- 
[02:33:00]  Of course it's Doc Brown.  It's not Doc Brown.  Mr. Tabor.  Is there anything-  Yeah, Mr. Tabor.  Is that not the most famous thing you've ever done?  Uh, it's, it's, it's made more impression on me than anything else.  It was like the first film and, and, uh-  But as far as the public goes, I would assume-  Yes, yeah.  It's probably Doc Brown.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, Jimmy?  From that, from that angle.  Yeah, yeah.  But what about Uncle Fester?  Mr. Tabor.  Mr. Tabor.  The fuck?  How many times a day do people walk up to you and go, Jack Dunphy's full of shit? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I know, not too often.  Not too often.  Yes, not too often.  So, you, by the way, you're promoting, excuse me for living, is out limited, uh, tomorrow.  Uh-huh.  And I read a brief synopsis.  What, what is this about?  It seems really good.  Well, it's, I don't know, kind of a comedy, romantic comedy kind of thing.  And I don't know if it happens in an asylum.  No.  Yeah.  Really? 
[02:34:00]  And, uh, yeah.  I'm this guy, I've kind of admitted myself, because I have problems, you know, that sort  of thing.  So it's fiction.  Oh, yeah.  I would hope.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to think that, uh, yeah, you're, uh, what are you trying to say?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fiction.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Do you have, when you, uh, when you, when you prepare for a role or something, this is  like a real non-actor question.  But do you, uh, do you kind of pull things from your own personal life, or is that not 
[02:34:30]  how you do it?  Oh, I try to.  Yeah.  I try to relate.  What, what do I know about this guy that I relate to, and kind of bring it out, you know.  I've got nothing else to go on.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that's, uh, that's what I do.  You've had some pretty iconic roles as far as, like, Doc Brown and, of course, Reverend Jim  on Taxi.  Mr. Tabor.  Thank you, Jim.  Mr. Tabor.  Yeah, well, Uncle Pastor.  Is, does that, does that make it difficult as, for an actor? 
[02:35:00]  To what?  To be like, uh, to, to, to, to branch out a little further in, in other roles.  No, I love it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm, I'm always looking for something, you know, cause I get a lot of scripts that  are kind of spinoffs of Doc Brown or Reverend Jim, or, you know, and, uh, I'll do it if  I can find a way to do it differently from what they thought.  Mm-hmm.  I was gonna do it.  Yeah, I'm always looking, looking to.  Yeah, yeah.  Go in another direction. 
[02:35:30]  But, but, I, I'm sure you've, you've done roles that you're very proud of, but don't  get the attention that, like, Back to the Future gets.  Does that bother you at all in any way?  No.  No?  I mean, I, I mean, even this thing, I mean, I, I, you know, I, I wish it great success  and all of that, but I don't think it's gonna have a wide, wide audience.  Yeah.  But, but I love doing it and, and, uh, really very satisfied with, you know, I'm really  have no, no regrets even.  Yeah.  I do some things, you know, when you rap, uh, independent, if you rap, you don't know 
[02:36:00]  if you'll ever hear about it again.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't, I don't, I don't care.  There have been some lemons in your, uh, in your.  There have been some lemons.  I mean, some of the shows may not necessarily be lemons, they just don't, can't find the  future.  But I've done a few, you know, and they have those volumes of, uh, films that are quick  synopsis and they have stars that say, you know, uh, you know, I have a few marked with  turkeys.  Oh, really? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  So I've done some.  We all do, sir.  We all do.  There's only one that I really, really, really, uh, kind of just, I'm embarrassed by, but.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And you're probably going to ask me which one.  I would, I forgot.  Just don't say, just don't say cuckoo's nest.  No.  No, not cuckoo's nest.  Hey, when you, when you auditioned for Taxi, uh, cause it was such an amazing role and the  way they addressed drugs.  Did you, did you come in, in the jacket and kind of create the look before they even knew?  Have you heard about this?  I have, but I don't know if it's a true story. 
[02:37:00]  Okay.  I don't.  Yeah.  I hate to repeat myself.  Um, yeah, I, I, um, they, uh, I got the, the side, so to speak.  And I thought I want, cause I usually try to go into the law just dressed to be the  characters nearly as I see it, you know?  And, uh, I had a friend of mine who lived up in Laurel Canyon, which was a big hippie  settlement at one time.  And he was cleaning out his bushes and he found this jacket, uh, with a piece thing on it. 
[02:37:30]  And I got some worn out shoes from an ex-father-in-law and some worn out jeans.  And I did a worn out that and I wore it.  And they said, when you come in Monday, bring that.  Uh, and I wore it for the rest of the, uh, of the, uh, the run.  Wow.  Except, uh, during one season I came back and somebody had stolen it from the, you know,  so they found another one.  But, uh, but, yeah.  Does that answer your question?  Phenomenal.  When you set Louie's apartment on fire and he said I was cooking something on the stove 
[02:38:00]  and he said it was a beanbag chair.  What a great character.  What a great show.  That's one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.  Yeah, I think I said something to Danny.  I didn't think he'd notice this.  Fabulous writer.  Yeah, yeah.  Fabulous writer.  Do you see TV writing as being a little softer and different now?  Because we were talking about how back then it was real people on TV, like yourself and  Danny DeVito and like, you know, Danza was the good-looking guy. 
[02:38:30]  Uh-huh.  But, uh, do you see that we've kind of gotten away from that?  Maybe.  I don't watch that, that religiously.  But, uh, I, I did a pilot, I've done a, I just did a pilot for the second time and  it's called Kings of Van Nuys and it's a, it's a family that I like on the very bottom  of the economic ladder and it's a comedy and, and, and the, the, each episode they're looking  for a get rich theme, scheme and, and it, it always fails. 
[02:39:00]  But, uh, these characters, I like it because the characters are very raw, they're, they're,  um, multi-ethnic and they're, they're nuts.  There's not anything really civilized about it, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of loving it  and, and so I hope it gets picked up.  That's something you don't see, uh, very often.  Yeah, I mean, it's just, and it's scheduled for Friday nights, you know, when people are  home having beer and, uh, and just get something that's kind of loose and, uh, risky and nuts. 
[02:39:30]  You know, so I hope it goes.  Do you do like, oh, sorry.  Uh, Andy Kaufman.  Yeah.  Always wanted to know, uh, yeah, I mean, he worked with the dude firsthand.  Uh, what was he, what the public persona we all saw, the bits he did, the stuff he did,  it seemed genius.  What was he like when no cameras were around?  Could you have a conversation with the dude or was he always on?  Yeah, we, we kind of took to each other sort of, I mean, I was a new guy on the show and, 
[02:40:00]  and he took me to some of his mud wrestling matches and I, I was like, you know, this is  all new to me and, uh, interesting, but he, he, he was kind of very mild, um, personally,  you know, when he wasn't working, very mild, um, very likable kind of guy.  He's very sincere and people often asked me, was he nuts?  And I don't think he was nuts at all.  I think he knew exactly what he was doing. 
[02:40:30]  He had an agenda.  He had an idea of the kind of comedy he wanted to present and his take on things.  And he set about doing it.  And, uh, uh, he, he was very, very, very sane.  He just had followed a different drummer or something like that.  I remember one time I was thinking about it the other day.  It just, it was so gutsy.  Uh, we were in rehearsal during taxi.  Once in a while, he wouldn't, I remember one night he didn't show up.  Oh boy. 
[02:41:00]  It was time to go on.  And, and, and, uh, as a result of the order of the scenes being done, you know, had to be pushed around.  Wow.  And somebody found him in the parking lot in his car, uh, doing oom drills or something with his girlfriend.  And he said, of course, like, you know, so he, so he was a little bit like that.  I don't know.  That's a lot of guy.  One day, Tony Danza got so infuriated with him.  And he, he got a fire extinguisher and went into Andy's dress room and went, you know, 
[02:41:30]  the foam.  Yeah.  And he just sprayed him, sprayed him with it.  But one, one time, uh, somehow the talk came into levitation and Andy was sort of in that realm  of spiritual whatever.  And he said, yeah, I can levitate.  And there was a break, you know, a 10 minute break on the stage where the camera was over.  And he said, okay, I'll levitate. 
[02:42:00]  And he sat down on the floor of the stage and everybody's like, you know, he's putting  himself out there.  And he sat down and took the yoga position, the whole thing.  And we waited for him to levitate.  And it was kind of, I mean, who does that?  You know, I mean, he put himself on the line and he just sat there and finally the production  man said, we got to, we got to continue rehearsal.  What a weird thing to do.  And he was just sitting there while looking at him and he was like perfectly composed. 
[02:42:30]  He just knew everybody would sit there.  That was the whole gimmick.  Everyone watching him.  Yeah.  What a weird thing to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's watch.  You know?  Yeah.  I think the idea was like, with this dude, anything might be possible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If he believes it enough, is it going to happen?  Right.  I remember when I was a kid and when he passed, there were a lot of people that were like,  he's not gone.  Right.  He's just waiting and then, man, he's going to spring on the public.  And every like 10 years, somebody writes an article about, hey man, this would be about 
[02:43:00]  the time that Danny would pop.  And I always dream that like, I'll be 50, 60 years old.  And like the dude's just waiting for the perfect moment to be like, ta-da.  And he actually did it.  That would be the ultimate, like, that would be the ultimate anti-Coffmanism.  Oh man.  Right?  I don't know.  At least from a spectator point of view.  I didn't know him personally.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love, too.  One of my greatest Christopher Lloyd moments, again, Taxi, and this is, the writing was brilliant,  but this is all you, is when you're at Harvard and you take one bite out of that brownie  and you say, some people get addicted to drugs. 
[02:43:30]  I could be one of those people.  And you go into the gym face and then back to the, oh my God.  And you're just funny, because I thought that moment was, I was new on the show, and I  just thought that moment was so forced.  I just thought, you know, and then whatever.  And I, it's not very helpful for the radio listening audience.  It was an excellent face.  You smiled.  You took it to right the end.  Christopher smiled.  It seemed to work. 
[02:44:00]  One of the first time, the first, almost the first show I did as a regular, because I  was a guest, I married Lofka.  I was a guest on the show about a month before I became a regular.  Oh, man.  And I married, I came in, and they got me off the street to marry Lofka to some woman  so he could get his greeting card.  And then I came back as a regular, and I did the scene where I get my driver's license.  And then we broke.  Oh, yeah.  We broke for the Christmas holidays, and they handed out the scripts we were going to do 
[02:44:30]  when we came back.  And it was this episode where I have a horse that dies in my bed.  Gary.  Gary.  I just thought, are they nuts?  This isn't funny.  It's kind of gross.  But then I understood.  You know, I understood a little more about comedy.  You said he was sleeping.  Gary was sleeping on his back for like three days. 
[02:45:00]  He's dead, Jim.  So your approach to it, you didn't come through it through comedic acting.  You came through it through straight-up performance?  Yeah, just playing acting.  Were you theater trained?  Or where did you begin?  And I started here, and I lived kind of nearby, and I went to the neighborhood playhouse for  a couple of years.  And yeah, totally.  I did Cuckoo's Nest, my first film.  That's your first film.  I was in 33, 34 when that happened.  Had you been in the play at all, or no?  I'd done a lot of plays. 
[02:45:30]  But not that play, not the Cuckoo's Nest play?  No, I hadn't done that, no.  So you went to, it was your first audition.  Somebody said, hey, man, they're casting a movie.  And you're like, all right, we'll try it out.  Yeah, I was a casting director here, and he submitted me for it, and I auditioned a couple  of times.  That's a young Milos Forman, man.  He's a pup at that point.  Did you keep in touch with Will Sampson after?  I did for a while.  We spent a lot of time together. 
[02:46:00]  Don't ask me why, but we did.  He was such an extraordinary, iconic person, and he just had a presence about him that  was stunning.  Yeah.  You know, he was so tall and just self-possessed, and he was an amazing, amazing person.  And then Danny DeVito, of course, Mr. Martini, which I think is his most famous role.  You guys were in that first together. 
[02:46:30]  You guys did before Taxi together.  Yeah, yeah.  It was odd when things like that happened.  Isn't that weird?  Yeah.  And then they ended up, like, when you show up on Taxi, you're like, hey, man, small world.  And he pretended he didn't know you because you were the new guy.  He's like, yeah, that was them.  This is now.  Go marry Latka.  This is my show.  As far as Back to the Future goes, it's just such popular culture now.  What is the one thing people ask you the most about that, with that question? 
[02:47:00]  Because it's always the time travel questions.  Did this happen, and how many DeLoreans were there?  What's the one that you get asked the most?  I don't know.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Yeah?  But it must be, then, a lot of the same kind of questions.  A lot of people do an impersonation of Doc Brown.  Well, of course.  It is one of those that people love doing an impression.  They'll do that.  And they'll want me to say, great, Scott. 
[02:47:30]  And stuff like, roads.  We're going, we don't need roads.  All of us are going to make you do that on our phones before we leave today.  Please, Christopher.  And, yeah, they just, which one I like the best of the three, and I always say the third one.  You do?  Yeah.  And that's the most Doc Browniest.  It's all about Doc Brown.  It is Doc Brown's vehicle, yeah.  It was in the West.  I mean, Western is always fun. 
[02:48:00]  There was horseback riding.  That's always fun.  Yeah.  Working on that locomotive.  A locomotive.  Those steam engines were amazing.  I mean, they were amazing.  Yeah, that was the real deal.  Living organism.  And they weren't very CG heavy in those days.  No, no, no.  So that was a lot of real locomotive work, right?  CG meaning?  The computer graphics.  That came later on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you were actually on a train.  Like, you were shooting on a train.  And apparently, even two identical steam engines, they're not the same. 
[02:48:30]  They have their own, maybe like a sailboat.  You have to do a little more of this, a little more of that.  Each one's just individualized.  But it's amazing.  It's amazing.  Like a living beast.  Yeah, it is.  That's amazing, yeah.  Do people, can they ask you about Doc Brown a lot?  Do they ever come up to you and ask?  Oh, and I had a romance, too.  Yes.  Very steam virgin, man.  The love interest.  Finally, a romance.  Totally, the love interest.  And that was the last one I did on film.  Not a lot.  First and last. 
[02:49:00]  Except I had one where I blew up my romance as Captain Krug.  That's true.  Yes, she was on the other ship.  My love was on another spaceship and out of experience.  And you had it.  See, I had to blow it up.  Sorry.  You had to blow it up.  Sorry, honey.  That was the search for Spock?  That was, yeah, yeah, that was the one.  Return of Spock.  When you, yeah, you were a Klingon.  That was kind of when they first got into that Klingon heavy makeup.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Because in the original Star Trek series, it was just a guy.  It was just a dude.  With a Fu Manchu.  That's all they had.  They made him a little more alien.  Like a lobster head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's obviously.  I'm a big fan of.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was only going to ask about the scene where you kept poking Mr. Harding and telling him  to play the game.  Play the game, Harding.  Play the game.  Jimmy loves cooking.  It's a masterpiece.  He is.  But that was such a great, that was such a great, you were just so fucking annoyed with 
[02:50:00]  him.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  I told him so.  Quit touching me, see?  Son of it.  Son of it.  I'm sorry.  The, yeah, yeah.  So, so three was your favorite to do and to, and to watch?  Well, I don't know.  I, I, I enjoy the first one.  I also, I like them all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I kind of get off on the third one the most because I had, I, you know, I had that  romance and I had the, you know, the, all that stuff. 
[02:50:30]  Got to play with a lot of, a lot of toys.  I had that huge machine that I invented in a, that ice maker.  Yeah, the ice maker.  That was just, all the steam and everything and a little cube would come out.  So, anyway, it was fun.  And then there's always the questions, it's like, that obviously you have nothing to do  with, you were the actor playing Doc Brown, but it's like, what if the Libyans would have  shot you in the head?  I mean, you know, you didn't know.  It's just, the note just said you were, you were shot, you know, by the Libyans. 
[02:51:00]  How did you know you weren't going to shot in the head?  And you were, so you wear a vest.  Yeah, I've, I've run into a couple of Libyans.  Oh, yeah.  And there was not a, they, they were not happy about it.  They weren't.  That they had been, that they had been chosen to be.  To be the bad guys.  Yeah.  In one of the most beloved films of all time.  When they watched it, you know, back in their country, there was not, there was not a good 
[02:51:30]  feeling about it.  And that scared me.  They should have just dubbed it differently.  Said they were Jews.  They should have just dubbed it differently.  Look, the Mexicans.  Oh, Mexicans.  Yeah.  Let's dub it.  They want us to plug two for Christopher.  We got a note.  There's a new movie he's got out called Yesterday and Today.  It's video on demand.  And that's tomorrow.  You can get that tomorrow, which is Friday, the 12th of October.  Yesterday and Today.  I love that video on demand.  One more time with the name.  One more time.  I don't recall the project. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, well, you're.  Yesterday and Today.  That's, unless our soon-to-be-fired.  Iraq, comment?  Iraq.  That's what Roland gave me.  That's a clincher.  Roland gave you that?  He said that's what he got from Christopher's people.  Okay, well.  Oh, boy.  You want me to look it up?  Yeah, someone look up Yesterday and Today, because if it's not a Christopher Lloyd movie.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, watch me, Christopher Guest.  Can we talk about the installment in Back to the Future that never gets the respect it's  owed is The Ride, man. 
[02:52:30]  The Ride was a mini-adventure within the movies.  And you're a big, you're a big feature of The Ride.  I loved that ride.  You waited with us in line and come up on the video all the time and keep us updated, you  and Biff.  And then once you get into The Ride, it's all Doc Brown.  Yes.  It's pretty amazing.  The rules of, yeah, what we had to do.  It was all Doc Brown telling us what to do.  And then when we go into the mouth of the Tyrannosaurus, great, Scott, it's a Tyrannosaurus.  It's a Tyrannosaurus.  That was a cool ride.  That ride is amazing, yeah. 
[02:53:00]  That was a cool ride.  And I don't know if they've done it in Florida, but in Hollywood, they replaced it with the  Simpsons ride.  But the Back to the Future one, I think, is still in the Japanese Universal Studios.  Oh, really?  If I remember correctly.  It is a fantastic, fantastic ride.  And the first of its kind, one of those motion rides.  It's like now it's everywhere.  They got one for the Transformers up at Universal.  There's a King Kong tram ride.  It's kind of like it.  But this is the first ride where you jumped into a DeLorean with a bunch of other people,  the large, oversized DeLorean.  Yeah.  And it was an interactive experience. 
[02:53:30]  You were in little rooms watching videos.  Yeah, when you were waiting on line, it wasn't just waiting on line.  You were in those little rooms, and the note was there.  And the show began while you were waiting in line.  Yeah.  And then the car would be elevated to essentially an IMAX screen.  Yep.  And based on your perspective, the screen is big.  You're not seeing people to your right and to your left unless you're a jackass who cranes  your head over and be like, oh, there's the other car.  Stop ruining the illusion, dummy.  Totally.  But if you want to bury in the illusion, man, suddenly you were taken through time, guided 
[02:54:00]  by Doc Brown, who would be on a little screen in the car periodically.  Yeah, yeah.  It was phenomenal, man.  And I would go on it, then get off the ride, go back again.  It was a ride you could do five times in a row and still see different things each time.  And it fit into the continuity of Back to the Future.  That was the important thing for a nerd.  It really fit.  It wasn't like, oh, this has nothing to do with the movies.  Yeah.  It was an adjunct that worked without Marty McFly.  It was awesome.  It was awesome.  It was cool.  You did a great piece of work there.  Yeah.  That's heavy lifting because you're the whole show at that point. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you burn your leg, really, when you guys were throwing around Mr. Harding's cigarette  and it landed in the cup of your pants?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you really get burned?  I didn't really get burned.  Okay.  I wanted to ask you that for 30 years.  But Mils Forman got the idea from that.  He was, before he defected from Czechoslovakia, he was on a late at night on his train platform  waiting for a train and there was a guy smoking on the platform and he took the butt and flicked 
[02:55:00]  it and it landed in the cuff of somebody else that was waiting on the platform and they  didn't notice it until their pants began to burn up.  And he said the guy totally flipped out.  He totally, he just, you know, went screaming and crazy on the platform and that's, that's  And that was his inspiration for us to get that in the movie.  He carried with me.  Oh, wow.  But you couldn't have looked crazier. 
[02:55:30]  And nobody knew that a cigarette butt had been thrown.  So even though you, I think you were one of the very few that was committed.  It was you and Chief Bromden and maybe one of the persons that were actually committed.  Yeah.  I'm babbling.  No, it's a great movie.  Let's take it to Buckaroo Banzai.  Ah, yes.  Buckaroo Banzai, does anybody on set know what they were making or they were just like,  we just trust the director at this point?  I think they knew what they were doing.  And the producer of the film was kind of a crazy guy. 
[02:56:00]  I think he'd been, been cited for doing funny, funny, illegal stuff.  But I don't think he fully understood what he was producing.  Right.  You know, because there was a lot of complaints from people involved with the show that he,  the way he edited it, whatever, he didn't really know what he was working with.  But we knew.  You know, it was so crazy and it was so cool and such a great cast. 
[02:56:30]  I mean, Peter Weller and so many others, you know, it was...  Dan Hedaya's in it too.  Yeah.  John Lithgow.  Right.  What's her name?  She's on that show now.  Ellen Barkin.  Ellen Barkin.  I remember Ellen Barkin lying out practically naked.  And whereas me and Vinsky Valley and the other one, there were three of us.  Dan Hedaya.  Would become crazy.  They'd become the aliens.  And she'd lie in there and we were doing something with her and she had real spiders crawling on her. 
[02:57:00]  I don't know if you remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  They put this kind of jelly on her and then they were putting stuff on her.  Wow.  It's sexy.  Oh, man.  How did she look almost naked?  Yeah.  He just saw his head.  Did you remember that?  It's a confirmation.  I think that's the more important part of the story.  That was great.  That was Jim.  Reverend Jim showed up for one second. 
[02:57:30]  That's funny.  I can't find this movie, by the way.  Which one?  No.  The one that they want to promote.  Can someone find out from Roland why?  Because Iroh came in while we were.  I can't find it.  So we want to make sure we don't want to interrupt.  Yesterday and today or something like that?  Yesterday.  I think it's possible.  I want to head to Roland.  Iroh, Roland misread something.  The Friars Club had honored Christopher Lloyd, which is going to be on video on demand.  But the movie is called Excuse Me for a Living.  Are we on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we've been promoting that.  Yeah, we promoted that, Iroh.  Yeah, right?  If I was listening, I thought maybe I lost. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  Have you put on the headphones?  He talks into our ears.  Oh, he's talking.  Right there?  The guy in the producer.  Then you'll hear the other guy.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that...  Believe me, it's only him, so it doesn't matter.  He's...  He doesn't really say anything.  What they were saying was you had done a roast.  You were Friars roasted?  I was...  Were you roasted by the Friars?  You were honored by the Friars?  Yeah, there's a press release.  Oh, boy.  Honored by the Friars.  Oh, boy.  I had a...  I have a mouse bird now.  No, the Friars.  The Friars.  Oh, the Friars.  Yeah, not the Friars, no. 
[02:58:30]  God, well, scratch.  You don't even need the headphones if you don't want to.  Yeah, take them off.  Yeah, these people are confusing me.  Yeah, the Friars, yeah.  We all went there.  I have a cast for...  Excuse me, for a living.  And three of us were honored with the cast of the year.  Jerry Stiller, and...  Oh, Jesus, they'll kill me.  Yeah, don't go making yourself nuts over it. 
[02:59:00]  You got through Ellen Barker naked.  There's nuts more.  Exactly.  You're still recovering from it.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that was interesting.  I've never been there before.  Yeah.  How have you moved on since, I mean, the fire?  You called.  We talked to you on the phone after that.  And you seem like, as devastating as that is, that you handled it, like, kind of like,  hey, it's what life does.  And you seem to handle that better than most people would have.  Yeah.  It was sort of strange.  But it's all rebuilt now. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's all cool.  But that was odd.  Wow.  How do you...  Just that much, yeah.  What's the process after that?  You just kind of decompress for a while, or...?  Kind of decompress.  I had a friend, and she wanted to get into the building.  She's a real estate, but she wanted to get into the building.  And she never liked the house, particularly.  And I could see the wheels going around there.  You know, she wasn't really grieving. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, let's make some lemonade.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she proposed, can I rebuild here?  Take it, and that's not something she had experienced in doing, but she, I felt, yeah, she could do this.  And she took it over and rebuilt this kind of semi-Tuscan-like residence, and it turned out beautifully.  Are you scared to be in the same spot?  Wasn't it the California fires, the wildfires? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Are you scared to be in the same spot?  No, because we're selling it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Not my worry.  Okay.  No, but it's, it was built to try to make it less flammable.  Less flammable.  Oh.  And the landscaping is, you know, we don't have dried up bushes.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, so it was kind of asking for, it was kind of built for a disaster the first time, not 
[03:01:00]  thinking.  Well, not really.  I mean, they hadn't had a fire in that area for 20, 30 years or something.  But it was just the dry, very dry at that point, too.  Were there some very, like, personally valuable things that you lost that were...  Well, I moved out of it and moved downtown, kind of, and about 90% of my stuff was in storage.  Oh, wow.  I moved out of it to sell it.  And then the slump, you know, real estate. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  So I was going to resell, I was going to sell the place I'd moved it to and moved back up  there until the market recovered.  Mm.  And did some cosmetic stuff, and then suddenly the fire came.  So most of that stuff was in storage.  Oh, that's great.  Okay.  Totally, man.  But, I mean, so many people got totally wiped out.  Yeah, yeah.  Totally.  Their cars, everything.  That's awful.  I was just thinking, like, because with a career like you've had, you must have some memories 
[03:02:00]  and just little trinkets and tokens of what you've done, that would be terrible to lose.  Jesus.  Yeah, I have some, but they weren't necessarily related to my business.  It was...  No?  Like, more personal?  Personal, really, it was simple.  I'm just thinking, like, wow, you know, maybe a signed picture of yourself.  Isn't it funny, though?  Don't a brown wig.  Yeah.  That's what we think.  He's got, like, family stuff.  Yeah.  Wasn't that that hat you wore in C-Nage?  Please tell me the flux capacitor wasn't in the house. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Well, I see Kirk.  Is Kirk out there?  Kirk is S-I-A.  Kirk.  Kirk.  Yeah.  I'm sure Kirk.  We should...  Yeah.  Thank Christopher Lloyd.  Yes, absolutely.  What a great day to have you here.  Oh, thank you.  Fantastic service.  We want to have to work so much.  Let's plug everything properly here.  You can meet Christopher.  He'll be at New York Comic Con, or you're doing a panel.  Friday and Saturday, there is a Q&A panel on Friday here in New York at the Javits Center,  I believe, right?  And Excuse Me for Living, which we humiliated ourselves by saying wrong, is out in limited 
[03:03:00]  release tomorrow, and it's also a video on demand, and, you know, it's a movie about  a suicidal druggie.  He's got to kind of obey his rehab clinic's demand to lead a senior men's group.  So it seems like a great movie.  And, you know, I'm happy that you're still working and still making great stuff.  Yeah.  Thanks so much, man.  And I guess we'll be back with Kirk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That Dunphy's full of shit. 
[03:03:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming back on now.  There we go.  We have returned.  Yes, Jimmy.  Opie had to lead because he's got to pick his kid up, so it's myself and Anthony, the great  Kirk Hammett, and, of course, Danny, who is a bit of a Metallica fanatic.  Just a bit.  Yeah, he's a nervous wreck.  Danny works on our show, and he's all nervous.  You and me both.  I've been on the show for, like, eight years, so I'm used to getting, you know, and especially 
[03:04:00]  in this place, people come in and out, and so I thought I was going to be okay.  And I was like, all right, Kirk's coming in.  I could deal with this.  But, no, I can't deal with this.  I'm completely freaking out.  It's cool, man.  Just drink some coffee or something.  Yeah.  You'll make him feel better.  You'll be fine.  You don't get nervous doing interviews, do you, or press?  You know, I've been doing it for so long.  No, I don't get nervous at all.  It's pretty crazy.  What makes you nervous?  Because, I mean, you're not nervous in front of crowds.  You play in front of, you know, massive arenas.  Is there anything that, like, you do that you're like, oof, this one's hard? 
[03:04:30]  Doing things like speaking at a wedding, that makes me super nervous.  Really?  You know, walking out on stage in front of 100,000 people, child's play.  It's crazy.  Isn't that odd what gets some people, and then you could, because obviously you would think  you could get up in front of a few people at a wedding and say something if you could  get up in front of a huge crowd and play, but not so much.  No, it's crazy.  I can't figure it out myself.  Are you always asked to play at every wedding you go to?  Hey, man, get up there.  You know, I'm guilty of jamming with, like, wedding bands pretty much. 
[03:05:00]  For the rest of my life, I'll probably be cursed with that.  Because, you know, at a wedding, everyone's having a good time.  Everyone's, like, celebrating.  Then the band starts playing, and you're thinking, ah.  That's got to be a wet dream for the band, for a wedding band.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I've played Louie Louie a million times.  The best would be if you stood up and demanded to play. 
[03:05:30]  Exactly.  Give me that thing.  You should play so fucking what instead.  Yeah, exactly.  You've, I mean, obviously, we all know you as a musician, but I didn't, when they gave  us this book a couple weeks ago to just kind of peruse through, it's called, Kirk has a  book, it's called Too Much Horror Business, the Kirk Hammett Collection, and it's an amazing  coffee table book.  I thought, like, wow, he's a horror nut, and he has all these photos of cool horror stuff,  but you own all this stuff.  That's all the stuff from my collection right there.  There's, every single piece in there is from my collection, and, you know, it's just my 
[03:06:00]  opportunity to showcase it all and share it with all the like-minded people out there,  and I'm actually very, very proud of it.  Now, is that everything that you have, or is that just a portion?  No, I would say it's about 40% of everything.  Look at this.  Kisses walking around.  Oh, man.  Kisses out there.  That's fucking crazy.  That's Paul Stanley.  Paul, love it, God.  Paul Stanley.  Wow.  Paul.  This is the most surreal thing I've ever seen. 
[03:06:30]  Paul, what's up, man?  Look, look.  Wow.  I gotta get my phone and document this.  This is a crazy thing.  I don't take pictures, but this is fucking weird.  You guys were great last night.  I was at the show at the Letterman Theater.  Amazing.  You were good, right?  Yeah, you were great.  Amazing.  Happy to see you.  Very cool.  How did I get here?  God damn.  What the hell is going on here?  What a surreal moment.  I know.  That was almost as weird as, was that Ozzy and Chubby Checkers?  Yeah.  That fucking day was just ridiculous.  Ozzy and Chubby Checker. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  That's crazy.  That happened in this very studio.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Chubby Checker and the Ozzy cover band.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  They spoiled a nice photo of Kirk talking to Paul with me pointing in my fat head.  That's great.  You're pointing accusingly.  It's like, we're just, I know Kiss is here today and I'm going to try to get a photo  at the band, but you know the fact that Paul Stanley just walks by in makeup.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Makeup at 10 o'clock in the morning, which means he probably had to start putting that  stuff on at least at 7 o'clock in the morning. 
[03:07:30]  No shit.  Did you grow up listening to any Kiss?  Oh, yeah.  I was a big Kiss fan when I was a kid.  Of course.  I mean, me and all my friends were, how can you not be back in the mid-70s?  Yeah, it's huge.  I mean, they were everywhere.  What is it like now to meet guys like that and they come in just to say hello to you?  I mean, I guess you get used to that after all the years at Metallica, but that's  got to be nice that they kind of see you as a peer and an equal.  Oh, it's surprising to me, you know, that people see us as peers like that.  I mean, when I see Paul or like, you know, the other night I saw Jimmy Page. 
[03:08:00]  I mean, those people are my heroes from my youth.  I mean, and still are today, but it's just crazy.  You know, I can like walk up to Jimmy Page and start talking to him about movie posters.  I mean, it's a very, very cool thing.  Well, didn't he own Aleister Crowley's house?  For a while, yeah, on the lock, on Loch Ness.  But I actually gave Jimmy Page a book the other night and he loved it.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he has an interest in this stuff and so I knew he would like the book. 
[03:08:30]  How did you get started?  Did you saw something you liked and started collecting?  You know, I've been into horror movies ever since I was a kid, you know, I was a five-year-old  kid and then when I was six years old, I started buying comic books and monster magazines and  I just took off from there and I've always been interested in horror movies and even when  I first started playing guitar, I mean, everything else just kind of like dropped off my map except  for music.  But I still, in the back of my mind, you know, was, you know, I had this interest and I still 
[03:09:00]  actively watched a lot of horror movies and then when I was older, I just decided to start  collecting again and this is what happens after collecting for a few decades.  How do you get started with, like, when people start collecting things, usually it's something  a little more physical, something that they could touch, like a toy or a collectible.  How did you get into actual the posters and these original movie posters from these iconic 
[03:09:30]  films of the 30s and 40s?  You know, that's a good point and there's not a lot of collectors of this stuff, but I  had a friend who was really, really into movie posters and he was into comic books as well  and I started buying comic books from him and every time I'd go over to his place, I'd  look up on the walls and I'd see all these beautiful posters and I thought, wow.  No, because I kind of, because this appeals to me because I love horror, I love the art  of the movie poster, so I think I read a Metallica book some time ago and there's a picture of 
[03:10:00]  you kind of laying in some of your collection.  I think that picture is actually in that book.  Yeah, yeah.  And I remember seeing that and I go, god damn, I wish I knew what else was in there.  And now I get to have this book, so this is fucking awesome to know.  Yeah, page by page, there it is.  Is there anything that you desperately want that you don't have?  I'm sure there is, but what is for you the holy grail?  Well, there's a few movie posters out there that just have not been found and there's 
[03:10:30]  particularly one or two that I've been looking for for a long time and I don't even know  if they exist.  They just have not shown up.  And one of them is a poster from the movie Murders in the Rue Morgue from 1932 that Bela  Lugosi is in.  There's only one copy known and it's in a collection in LA.  And it's just a beautiful movie poster.  And if anyone out there has a copy...  I don't think they're listening to this show.  Check in with Sirius Radio.  I heard a story that you tried to actually buy one of Bela Lugosi's Dracula capes. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, I tried to, but I tried to buy it from Bela Lugosi Jr., but we couldn't settle on  a price.  But then it went into auction and the price was just astronomical and I just had to take  a backseat to that.  What did it finally sell for?  You know, they're expecting to get at least a million dollars for it and that was just  insane.  That's a lot for a cape. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's Dracula's.  Yeah, it is Dracula's cape.  I got to draw the line somewhere.  Yeah, especially because it might not fit.  Exactly.  You know, my kids might think it's a blanket or something.  Take it outside.  Maybe the collecting has become too much or that it gets in the way.  Never.  Never, ever.  With all the televised hoarding that's going on these days, do you step back and go, am  I doing this too?  You know, I don't really watch TV.  I don't have cable, but I've heard of that show and I'm just waiting for someone to contact 
[03:12:00]  me.  Yeah.  I remember my uncle used to bring over old Fangora magazines and they stunk like a basement  and stuff, but I used to love going through them.  I remember those old pages and the pages were like a different paper and they would get yellow  and then if you looked really close at them, they would get like bugs or mites or shit  and that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And like, that's how you knew it was time to throw away your monster mag.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or like, you know, rats would come by and chew on the corners.  Yeah.  But they were the coolest thing and they were like gross, man. 
[03:12:30]  They had like some really disgusting murder kind of scenes in them and monsters.  It was great because it was before, obviously before the internet.  Like now if you want to know what's going on with whatever new monster movies coming out, you have  the information straight to your phone.  Yeah.  Like that was the only place to get that shit back there.  The way you got it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  That was the only source for me for a long time.  And so many people don't even understand that that's the only way shit was and it wasn't  even that long ago.  Yeah.  I mean, just acquiring this stuff.  I mean, back in the day, it took a lot of phone calls and writing a lot of letters 
[03:13:00]  to people and, you know, I used to put so much time on the phone just calling people  all over the country and trying to network and like, you know, just kind of track this  stuff down.  But nowadays, you just go up on eBay and see what's there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's insane.  You enjoy going to the movies too and seeing horror movies?  Yeah.  I still love horror movies and like, you know, I try to keep on top of all the newest 
[03:13:30]  stuff that comes out.  Yeah.  Do you like Walking Dead at all?  Oh, yeah.  I love Walking Dead.  Actually, you know, a good friend of mine is the executive producer, Greg Nicotero.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And he's responsible for all the zombie makeup.  Why don't you do a walk-on or something like that?  Yeah.  Do a cameo.  That would be so cool to see you just like be there for half a second and get killed or  something.  Zombie Kirk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm waiting for Greg to call me.  And where do you keep this stuff?  I know you probably take very good, because I collect stuff too, and I know how obsessive 
[03:14:00]  I get about it being valued and protected.  Do you put these in special like museum glass frames?  Yeah.  I mean, I try to put them in acid-free framing.  And I have a special glass that keeps out UV rays.  And yeah, you just have to do all that stuff or else, like you said, they'll start to yellow  and chip and kind of fall apart. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  I think it's the museum, actually.  That museum glass.  Where you look at the reflection and the light will all seem blue.  Yeah.  Like a bluish, rainbow-ish kind of thing.  Yeah.  You could just fold them up and put them in a drawer.  Yeah.  Put them in my back pocket.  Yeah.  Carry around with it.  Hey, check this out.  I mean, fold it.  Lars is a known art collector as well.  And I mean, obviously you guys collect extremely different types of art.  Have you guys ever busted on each other about the kinds of art that you collect?  You know, he has an appreciation for this stuff, and I have an appreciation for what he collects. 
[03:15:00]  Because, I mean, I actually do have some pieces of fine art myself, but I try to keep that  under the bed.  Is this displayed all over the house?  All over.  All over.  I mean, you walk into my place, and there's no bare walls anywhere.  Wow.  I mean, there's one section of my house that has a bare wall, and it's only because it's  curved.  I can't hang anything flat on it.  What's hanging in the bathroom?  A lot of artwork, believe it or not. 
[03:15:30]  I was just curious.  That was a legitimate question.  What's hanging in your bathroom?  Have you had to talk with your wife where she said, look, this has to stop?  She totally understands my obsession with this stuff.  And, you know, what I try to do is I try to maintain a section of the house that has  nothing on it.  Just like a very clean, simple kind of space.  Because, I mean, being around this stuff, I mean, it's sensory bombardment constantly.  And sometimes it's just nice to go in a room that is simple and doesn't have anything on 
[03:16:00]  the walls.  But, boy, I stare at those walls, and I think, oh, I could put a big movie poster right there.  That's an obsession.  That's great.  Yeah, but you know what?  I completely get it, though.  Because there are times, like, I'll go to your house, and you have big-ass empty walls.  And I'm like, man, I'll put a big, fine poster right there.  Yeah, totally.  Yeah, I know.  It's true.  I mean, he's got a movie theater that he built in his basement with no fucking posters  anywhere, no movie memorabilia.  Well, I have that.  I'd have yelled at him.  I'm like, get stuff you like.  I have movie posters on the wall down in the basement. 
[03:16:30]  And now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because you've got to be fucking convinced.  I know.  It's more that I'm just a lazy piece of shit than I don't want it.  You know, I do want it, but I don't want to put the work into doing anything.  I just think it's interesting that everybody, no matter who you are, you have a connection  to not only the movie that you love, but also the art that represents that movie.  I mean, and it means everything.  That is true.  That art, it represents from the first second of the title screen to the end credits.  That's the movie.  I'm a Thing fan.  I love the Thing.  Right.  That Thing poster rules.  And I have the one sheet, and I have different kinds of the one sheet. 
[03:17:00]  And I'll frame that, and I'll put it up on my wall because I love looking at it  because it reminds me of everything I love about that.  And we all do that, and it's crazy.  My favorite ones that I have is Alien.  I got one of the Alien posters.  That's a great poster.  So fucking cool.  Yeah.  That green little glowing light stuff.  And of course, Jaws.  Jaws is a great one, too.  Jaws poster, too.  What's hanging in your bedroom?  Iconic.  In my bedroom?  Movie posters.  You know what's hanging in mine?  Pictures of me with bands. 
[03:17:30]  I got each member of the band, and then each one is signed, and it's framed.  I got Motorhead, Kiss, Sabbath, Metallica.  So technically, you have no idea how many prostitutes you've seen by proxy.  But it's really creepy when they come in, and there's just all these pictures of me with  guys.  That really is creepy.  It's a little creepy.  But you just hang up where you like, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you surround yourself with things that make you feel good, right? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  What do you think of movie art that is alternative, that's becoming a fad now, and taking classic  movies, cult movies, maybe something like a Ferris Bueller or something like that, and  taking the original feeling of the film and producing new art for it?  Is that something that you're into?  I love it.  I love seeing that.  There's this one guy I found on the internet, and what he would do is he would make these  movie posters from an alternative universe.  I mean, he would make a poster based on a James Bond film, but the main villain would 
[03:18:30]  be like David Bowie, you know?  That's so odd.  Yeah.  It's crazy, but it totally works.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, there are some companies that are getting pretty popular producing that kind of  thing, and I think there's really a market for it.  Yeah, I mean, a lot of comic book artists are coming out and doing their interpretation.  Is that something that you plan to collect as well, or are you set in your collections?  You know, I have to draw the line somewhere, man.  I have to draw the line somewhere. 
[03:19:00]  Oh my God, wait, Kiss is walking by.  What the hell is going on here?  There goes Gene.  There goes.  This is so crazy.  Yeah.  There's...  Hey!  Hey, Norton!  Hey, Norton!  Hi, buddy.  No kidding!  No kidding!  It's the God of Thunder himself.  It certainly is.  How are you doing, Norton?  You guys were great last night.  I went and saw you.  I just...  Paul popped it.  I just told him.  Thank you.  You like it, right?  I'm good at you.  Yeah, how you doing, man?  It's good to see you.  I fucked this guy.  Hey!  Jesus Christ! 
[03:19:30]  This is insanity.  No, I've heard a lot about this.  Take it out.  I put a lot of time...  That's a Chuck Berry thing.  Get a shot of it.  Too much monkey, but this one came too much first, right?  Well, actually, it's a title from a Misfits, uh, Misfits song, but...  Before Misfits.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Misfits.  Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.  Can't sell a fucking record, but everybody wears their t-shirt.  Yeah.  If they were so great, how come nobody bought the record?  That's so true.  It's like the Attics, right?  Fucking record.  Not one record sold.  But t-shirts, everybody wears them.  By the way, the t-shirts were all Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen. 
[03:20:00]  That's where the skull came from.  Yeah, yeah.  1943 Republic Pictures.  Crimson Skull.  Crimson Skull is exactly right.  Yep.  Jesus.  It was nice to see me again.  Absolutely.  It was nice to see me again.  I like that episode.  I like it.  Seven.  Seven.  Seven.  Are you on a book tour?  Yeah, I'm promoting the book.  I thought Jimmy was going to talk to Scott.  Thank you.  I think it's cool.  I like the double kick.  I think it's got a thing. 
[03:20:30]  Thank you.  This is your style of book, Jimmy.  The new single is great.  Wow, this is awesome.  You're fucking hella, hella.  This is like another Michael McDowell thing.  It really is.  You just let it happen.  And it was so odd to see Gene in makeup, in full makeup, come through that door.  He's fucking seven feet tall.  And he just goes, hey, not to Jimmy.  Where can you get it?  I wasn't pitching for you.  He just, no, he did.  I would want to know because I want to get it for a gift for some people. 
[03:21:00]  It's not available as an e-book.  You got to buy the actual book.  You don't want to buy the physical book.  I wouldn't want an e-book, wouldn't I?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  We'd love to chat and promote your book.  No, you wouldn't.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, this is fantastic.  Okay, come in there.  Oh, my God.  Well, don't you want to be in it?  Yeah, do it.  With Kirk Hammett?  There it is.  They're taking a picture right now.  With Kirk, holding the book.  You're welcome.  How about that?  Love it. 
[03:21:30]  That's huge.  This is just getting so weird in here.  I will.  I will.  There's little kinds of rock going on here.  I love your tongue.  Head feel?  Oh, no, it's nice to see me again.  It's good seeing you, Gene.  Pleasure.  Too slow.  Too slow.  Oh, dude.  That's the full goddamn regalia right there, man.  Those boots rule.  I mean, those boots have a place in my book.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:22:00]  Here's a great picture of Kirk and Eric and Gene.  And some fucking little troll popped in at the end.  You can just Photoshop me out.  I would if I were you.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's for the black marker.  That's so cool, man.  Fucking wild.  But it's weird.  It's weird.  It's like when I see, I mean, you just feel like a, I get like all crazy when I see guys  like that that I've like kind of idolized my whole life.  Oh, yeah, totally.  I mean, you know, every time I see those guys in Kiss, I'm brought back to a 12-year-old 
[03:22:30]  sitting in my bedroom listening to Kiss Alive.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  What for you was the first one you met or the first person you met in the business that  blew you away?  Like, I can't believe I'm talking to this person.  God, it's been a while.  Let me think.  You know, I think the first time I met Ozzy, I was just so blown away because I was such  a big Black Sabbath fan.  And like Cliff Burton, too.  When we first met Ozzy, we were speechless. 
[03:23:00]  And yeah, that was back in the mid-1980s.  And yeah, I mean, for a long time, I couldn't be in his presence because I just, I just,  I feel like I just swallowed my tongue.  I couldn't see.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But nowadays, I see Ozzy, he's like, hey, how you doing?  Ozzy's like, all right, Kirk.  I saw you on that tour.  It was the, was that Ride the Lightning, I think, when he was doing Bark at the, no,  it was Molly Trox.  It was Master of Puppets and it was.  Ultimate Sin, I think, for Ozzy.  Yeah, Ultimate Sin, yeah, with old Jakey Lee on guitar. 
[03:23:30]  Right, right, right.  Yeah, and they would do that weird, that weird Journey to the Center of Eternity thing.  Oh, maybe that was the tour before.  But Ozzy did some weird shit.  Yeah, no shit.  So, okay, back to the book because I really, I can't get enough of this.  The Exorcist poster, you have the original?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you have any copies of anything or no, it's all original?  They're all original, yeah, they're all original, country of issue.  And, yeah, I mean, if it was a copy, why put it in the book? 
[03:24:00]  You know, the whole point was to showcase all the best pieces and all the best pieces  are always, you know, the original stuff.  What pieces got destroyed by accident?  Because I know there has to be some.  Well, you know what gets beat up a lot is a lot of the old monster toys, because a lot  of it was in storage.  And when I brought it out, I mean, a lot of it was in like a million pieces.  Oh, yeah.  And so, I mean, at one point, I was sitting on the kitchen table with a tube of crazy glue, 
[03:24:30]  putting it all back together for like, for ages.  But also, some of the masks are really, really fragile, because it's made out of latex and  latex.  You're talking like movie prop masks.  Yeah, latex has a tendency to kind of degrade over time.  So, I had a friend of mine come up from L.A.  He works at a special effects studio, and he kind of saved a lot of this stuff, kind of 
[03:25:00]  like reconstructed it and repainted a lot of this stuff and brought it back up to speed.  Is there anything, are you OCD about stuff?  Like, if there's something, like you said you had to glue it together, do you like, okay,  now I have this, but then you become obsessed with the fact you had to glue it together and  you need to get another copy of it?  You know, I, for a long time, I was obsessing over having the toy and then having the toy  in the box behind the toy, and yeah, it's nuts. 
[03:25:30]  And for a long time, you know, when I was buying a lot of comic books, I had to buy two copies,  one to read and one to just file away, put away.  But that's not that crazy.  With Metallica money, if that's the worst, that's not that bad an obsession to have.  At least you're not, you know, hopefully you're not gambling like, you know, two million  at a shot.  That's not a bad thing to have.  You can look at it, you can show people you got a book.  I'm buying, you know.  Two X-Men's.  Yes.  I'm going to treat myself.  Now you can technically write all this stuff off because it kind of went into your book.  Like, no, it was all research for a book.  Yeah.  And that's, that's a good thing about having a book is all of a sudden now this stuff has 
[03:26:00]  a, has a, you know, a tendency to be deductible.  Yeah.  It has a purpose too.  It's like, and you want to show people, but you can't just file fans through your house.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I mean, you could, if you wanted to.  I'd be down for something like that.  Danny would love that.  I'm out there all the time.  I mean, I don't even know where he lives.  You could buy the book and then like cut them out and put them in little frames and hang  them up in your own house.  There you go.  Tiny little frames.  Hey, was there anything you almost bought or almost got that you didn't, that you look 
[03:26:30]  back on and you go, that was a mistake?  There's a few things that I've like let slip through my hands and you know, it's just  from pure ignorance.  One time this guy offered me this amazing Frankenstein poster and I didn't believe him.  I thought he was just like pulling my leg, but it turns out it was, you know, it was the  real deal and I missed out on it.  And yeah, that's when I regret.  Have you ever, you've never gotten it since then?  No, no, I went to another collection and sometimes, you know, when, when things go into collections, 
[03:27:00]  they just don't leave.  I mean, I tell everyone, my collection is like a vault.  Once something goes in, it's not coming in, coming out.  Do you have one of the more complete collections?  Do you think?  I think so.  I mean, there's one other collection that I think is more comprehensive than mine.  And, uh, uh, it's, uh, the guy is actually a friend of mine and he put out a book about  20 years ago and, uh, when I saw his book, it kind of opened my eyes to the potential  that of me making a book, you know, some, you know, a few years down the line, but his 
[03:27:30]  collection, he's been starting, well, he started collecting in the sixties when this stuff  was, wasn't even considered collectible.  It was just like, you know, something that's just laying around that no one wanted.  Right.  Yeah.  And, and now it's, you know, it's rare stuff.  It's coveted.  It's valuable.  And, uh, yeah, he has an amazing collection.  Who do you think is the best Dracula?  Bill Lugosi, without a doubt.  See, I like Christopher Lee.  I love Christopher Lee, but Bill Lugosi for me, I mean, he's the iconic image of Dracula. 
[03:28:00]  And after watching Ed Wood, that just whole, that wrapped it up right there.  And there you go.  You want to, and we could bring it all back around.  One sheet that's hanging in my, in my living room is a gigantic Ed Wood poster.  I love it.  I love that movie.  That is a great fucking movie.  Yeah.  I thought, I thought Martin.  That was great.  Landau was amazing.  Great job.  You want an Oscar for that?  Yeah.  Eddie.  But Ed Wood didn't do very good editing though.  I don't know if that was showcasing the film.  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  A man on his side would have trouble walking through doors. 
[03:28:30]  I could make a whole feature with this stock footage.  Yeah.  I love that movie.  Yeah.  I love it too.  And you could quote it all day long and most people don't know what you're talking about.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  I like to wear women's clothes.  That was just, that was a statement from Jim.  Yeah, exactly.  I just did it in his voice.  It's nice to be able to say things in movie voices.  We don't have a lot of time left, but me being the fanboy that I am, I have to ask  a little bit about Les Claypool.  I'm a huge Primus fan, and I know you guys went to high school together.  We did.  High school.  He was in my algebra class.  Did you guys ever get...  How fucked up is that?  The Bay Area is an amazing place. 
[03:29:00]  I just want to move there so I could watch all the people get famous, you know?  But with Claypool, I mean, I'm sure you guys jammed at some point in the younger  years.  Yeah, we played a million times together.  I mean, certainly there's a recording somewhere.  Yeah, I'm sure there is somewhere.  I would pay money for that.  I want to hear that.  I want to hear Kirk and Les jamming from high school.  I have to say, when Les first started playing bass, he started playing in that particular  Les Claypool style from the very beginning. 
[03:29:30]  I know.  Well, I just got turned on to Blind Illusion.  Oh, there you go.  It fucking rules.  It's the most...  And I would have never expected that out of fucking Les Claypool.  And Larry, I'm listening to these riffs.  I'm like, this is hard as fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blind Illusion were a fantastic band.  And in fact, when I started Exodus, it was Exodus and Blind Illusion.  And we were, you know, we were rival bands.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Wow.  We were always checking each other out, you know, and seeing who had better songs, better 
[03:30:00]  equipment, you know, better shows.  Yeah.  You fucking asshole.  Yeah.  It's got brand new shit.  Yeah.  It's a bigger amp than I do.  Yeah.  Where'd you get that?  Yeah.  To let people know, too, the book is called Too Much Horror Business.  It's the Kirk Hammond Collection.  It's a, you know, again, you can't get this on, like Kirk said to Gene, it's not a Kindle  book.  It's a real book.  No, you need it.  It smells good.  It just smells like nice, really rich pages.  Yeah.  I mean, it's meant to be an experience when you open it up and look at it. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, I am really adamant about people actually going out and buying the book so they  can hold it and, like, turn the pages and look at all the beautiful pictures.  I agree.  And in the same way that, you know, who cares about buying a DVD anymore?  It's about the packaging.  You want the packaging.  Who cares about what's inside?  Right.  This is one of those cases where you can't just get this and have it.  You need the pages to look at.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're never going to appreciate that kind of thing on a fucking little eyepass screen.  Even if you're not a Metallica fan, it's like you've come up with a book where people 
[03:31:00]  could be, they could not like Metallica at all and still want to buy this.  No, I totally am.  No, if you're a horror fan or even just a movie fan or even just a collector, I think  you're going to, you would absolutely be into this book.  Yeah.  And the way the book's laid out, it's laid out in a way so that it kind of unfolds as  you look at it.  And, you know, that was really important for me for the book to have a flow to it.  Well, it's phenomenal.  You've done a great job.  I say phenomenal a lot.  I've been yelled at for that.  But it really is a great book. 
[03:31:30]  It's very classic.  I was blown away when I found out this was your collection and not just a book of shit  that you like.  And we should be plugging the signing, too.  There's a signing at Chiller?  Oh, where is that?  Well, we're doing a signing tonight.  Oh, I'm sorry.  At Barnes & Noble in Tribeca.  Okay.  And, yes, I will be doing a signing at Chiller Theater on October 28th.  Gene Simmons is licking the studio.  Gene Simmons is licking the glass.  The God of Thunder is interrupting your plug.  I love that big penis codpiece he's got on there.  When Gene went to shake his hand, I thought he was reaching for the dickpiece. 
[03:32:00]  I would have.  If Gene would have let me, I would have cupped it and said, that's pretty weighty.  Oh, Jesus.  I would absolutely do that.  So you're signing, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  I am doing a signing at Chiller Theater on October 28th.  Cool.  And I'm also doing a signing at New York Comic Con tomorrow, or actually on Saturday.  Saturday.  Yeah, Saturday.  Great.  I guess that's it for us today.  Thanks so much.  The great Kirk Hammett.  Thank you so much.  And Kirk will be on my Boneyard show tonight, too.  So if you like this interview, you're going to hear a lot more of us chit-chatting. 
[03:32:30]  Nice, man.  Appreciate it.  Thank you, Kirk.  Thank you, guys.  And everybody else, we'll see you mañana.  All right.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head after Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. </pre>
