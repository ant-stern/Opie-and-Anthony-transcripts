<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic mix of listener calls, in-studio antics, and pre-recorded segments.  The show opened with a discussion of "Whip It Out Wednesday," their listener-driven segment where women flash their breasts to drivers displaying "WOW" stickers.  Numerous callers shared their experiences, including Cowbell Bill, and Christine expressed frustration with sticker availability. Pauly, a New York City bus driver, recounted a particularly enthusiastic encounter. The hosts boasted about the segment's originality and its spread to other radio shows.

A significant portion focused on *Big Brother 2* contestant Justin Credible from Bayonne, New Jersey.  Opie and Anthony played an audio clip and discussed Justin's expulsion from the show for threatening and nearly assaulting a female housemate, Krista, with a knife,  after making out with her.  They detailed additional erratic behavior, including throwing a chair and urinating on a window, and urged listeners to spread this information online.  The hosts also discussed Angela from Bellevue, a previous guest who had been crying the previous day due to a breakup with her boyfriend.  They attempted to contact her.

The show featured the in-studio one-legged boxing match between Jimmy and Woody, with Woody, a drummer in a punk band, winning decisively.  Pictures and videos were promised for the show's website.  Listener calls followed, suggesting future "Cripple Bouts," including blind boxing and wheelchair jousting. Frank Caliendo and Adam Sandler made brief phone appearances.  The hosts announced the winners of their "Moms I'd Like to F" contest and played a contentious segment with Sandy Kane, featuring repeated profanity and the hosts throwing objects at her.

The broadcast included a segment showcasing a video clip of a *Big Brother 2* incident where Justin threatened Krista with a knife.  This prompted more listener calls, one from a driver who received positive attention for his "WOW" sign on a dirty car. Emma, a one-legged woman who was a guest the previous day, called back to express regret at missing the fight.

A significant portion was dedicated to a prank call segment where a caller, later revealed to be "Will," used a voice-altering device to impersonate multiple women in a "Bra Bingo" game, successfully fooling the hosts and other callers.  The prank involved fabricated female voices and bra sizes.

The show also included a segment featuring "Gay Marco," who recounted performing oral sex on a woman in exchange for NSYNC concert tickets.  The audio clip detailed Marco's emotional distress. The hosts discussed Michael Jackson's upcoming Madison Square Garden concerts and the high VIP ticket prices, leading to more calls and humorous banter.  A caller from Columbus, Ohio, initially agreed to box Woody but repeatedly hung up.  Another Columbus caller attempted to secure the match but used offensive language and "Baba Booey," angering the hosts.

A sexually explicit conversation between Marco and Randy, two gay men who had connected through the show, ensued.  The show attempted to shift the tone with "Bra Bingo" and "What's in My Pants," a segment where a female caller described her pubic hair using sounds made by rubbing a phone on her genitals.  The show concluded with listener calls, humorous banter, a fan and his father bringing beer to the studio, numerous advertisement spots for Hotwire and Bud Light,  and  updates on content to be posted on foundrymusic.com, including video of the one-legged boxer and a picture from the *Big Brother* incident.  Steve, from foundrymusic.com, was a studio guest.  "Smiley Guy" was repeatedly featured in the final Bud Light advertisements.

[00:01:30]  Oh, ah! Oh, ah!  It's awesome!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show for today, Wednesday.  Yes.  We love Wednesdays on the Opie and Anthony show.  Toll free, 877-692-1027.  Yes, indeed, it's Whip them out Wednesday, Anthony. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  We don't brag about much on this radio program.  We will brag about Whip them out Wednesday.  Yeah, people love it.  The greatest radio promotion ever invented.  Yeah.  And boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, we invented Whip them out Wednesday.  People do enjoy it.  You put WOW on your vehicle.  As you're driving home, a girl sees the WOW and just feels like showing you her beautiful breasts.  Yes.  And Philadelphia has WOW stickers.  Yep. 
[00:02:30]  I'm just getting a report that Chicago now has WOW stickers, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Vice.  New York has had WOW stickers for a very long time, and it's just a mess out there on the roads every Wednesday.  Girls just flapping them out everywhere.  You know, the newer cities, it's going to take time, but trust me, this thing works.  It's unbelievable.  You should start by making a homemade WOW sign, put it on the back of your car, drive around, and see what happens. 
[00:03:00]  Simple as that.  We have two simple rules.  Do not follow the ladies and do not harass the ladies.  That's it.  You put the WOW on your car, and then you just go about your business, and many, many people see boobs every single Wednesday.  You just forget about it.  And then, before you know it, you're next to a girl.  She's showing you her beautiful cans, and you're going, what?  Why is that girl doing?  Oh, yeah.  It's WOW.  That's right.  Pauly, the bus driver.  What's up?  Boys.  Hey, Pauly.  Good morning. 
[00:03:30]  Good afternoon.  Good evening.  It's citizens.  How you doing?  Hey.  Doing all right.  What's up?  You tell us.  Dude, I got the story, man.  Yeah?  I got you good stuff, Hope.  Yeah?  New York City bus driver, I am.  I go out this morning to go pre-trip my bus, and what do I have on the back of my bus?  But a gigantic WOW sign, bro.  Yeah, the bus things have started now, and the subway signs.  And it's just a huge version of the WOW sticker.  Yeah.  We were promised, like, bus signs and billboards when we first came to New York three years ago. 
[00:04:00]  They finally have given us what we wanted.  Yeah.  And now we have these just ridiculously huge WOW stickers all over the city of New York.  And they're on the back of these buses.  Yeah.  And, Pauly, you're getting WOW because it's on the back of your bus?  Dude, I got the grin on my face.  It's six o'clock in the morning.  I'm on autopilot going down the road, right?  Yeah.  And I see this Mustang come in front of me, yellow convertible, two chicks in it.  I'm still in a coma.  Who cares, you know?  Uh-huh. 
[00:04:30]  All of a sudden, the chick gets up, holds on to the robot, and pulls out the McGuffey.  Nice.  Dude, I mean, you got to see the guys were jumping out of the friggin' seats, man.  Women were disgusted.  I mean, dude.  And she blows me a kiss, and they just fly by.  Couldn't believe it.  What's the NTA logo now?  Wowing your way?  Yeah.  We encourage the ladies to wow the buses, because the buses have them all over New York.  They got huge wows on them.  There's huge wow signs on the back of the buses in New York.  That's classic.  All right, Paulie.  Hey, Hope. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Again, road show?  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  If you got my email, I want to challenge Jack Wild if Norton's not doing it.  Oh, okay.  I'm in, bro.  All right.  Sounds good.  And another thing, I got Bon Jovi tickets to donate to you guys if you want for what  would you do.  Ooh, Bon Jovi tickets.  Wow.  I'll do a few guys.  You know it, man.  I got them.  No problem.  All right, Paulie.  We'll probably have you in for the Zach Wild thing.  Okay.  And one more thing.  Any spare Spinal Tap, brother?  Spinal Tap tickets?  Any spare? 
[00:05:30]  What?  All right.  Put them on hold.  I love you.  All right, Paulie.  Only spreading across the country like a virus with no cure.  Right on, man.  I'm telling you, this wow thing, we don't have to tell New York, but we have to tell  the other cities.  It works like an effing charm.  That is so funny that the buses now have to go around with the wow sticker.  Pretty much.  It's a giant version of the wow sticker on the back of the bus.  Yeah.  Classic.  So, you're in those new cities, man.  We love the homemade wow signs.  That's how this whole thing started many years ago in Boston. 
[00:06:00]  Very underground.  Very underground.  You put the homemade wow sign on your car, and, you know, we got to tell the ladies  what that means, obviously.  So, it's going to take some time, but start by getting a homemade wow sign on your car,  okay?  There you go.  Our buddy, our pal, Cowbell Bill, excuse me, is on the line.  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, yeah.  There's wowing going on at exit 62 out here on the expressway.  What?  You got wowed?  I got wowed.  Was it nice? 
[00:06:30]  Nice lodge, baby, still.  Yeah.  I'd like to say thank you to the little brunette and the little blue car.  There you have it.  And what did you say?  Hey, wait a minute.  I'm Cowbell Bill.  Oh, yeah.  You might as well work it, Bill.  Why not, man?  Hey, I'm still recuperating from the Lucifer and Beelzebub Caligula show.  Yeah, that road show is out of control, man.  I'm just starting to get my hearing back, but I had a great time, guys. 
[00:07:00]  All right, Bill.  Cool, Bill.  All right, we'll see you for final time.  All right, cool.  Hi, Dan.  Yeah, we got plenty of pictures from the road show, if you haven't checked them out yet,  on our website, WNEW.com, FoundryMusic.com as well.  Hundreds of pictures and video clips.  Christine, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  We're doing well today.  That's good.  Listen, I can't find a WOW sticker.  I'm in Putnam County, and nobody has them.  Oh, boy.  We get this complaint every week from a bunch of ladies.  I'm driving around today, willing to show what I have, and nobody wants to see it. 
[00:07:30]  There's a beautiful set of boobs right there, and she wants to whip them out.  34 C.  They're not bad.  They're nice 34 Cs, right?  They're a nice 34 C, and I'm willing to show them, but I can never find a WOW sticker.  See, at this point, you're crazy not to just put a WOW in your car.  Yeah.  Christine could be next to you.  You don't even know it because you don't have a WOW sticker.  That's right.  All right, Christine.  Let us know if you'll find anyone today, okay?  I definitely will.  All right.  There she goes.  Christine, willing to WOW, can't find any WOWs on the highways in her area. 
[00:08:00]  Louis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, OA?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I just want to say you're hitting the Latino community hard as hell.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I was listening to Hot 97 in the morning.  Yeah.  I mean, not Hot 97.  My mega, 97.9.  La Mega.  La Mega.  A station that broadcasts half their programming in Spanish.  Right.  That's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I was listening to it, and they were talking about, oh, man, there's these two  crazy-ass dudes in the afternoon.  How about that, man? 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you got to watch that S-word.  Sorry.  They're doing this thing where women are whipping out there.  You know what?  And, you know, we wish we invented it.  And people started, people started, people started, I'm not seeing what you expect.  Hey, you sure use that S-word a lot.  Hold on there, Louis.  So they wish they came up with this, right?  Yeah.  Well, there's a lot of guys that wish they came up with this, and quite frankly, they  just said, eh, what the hell?  I didn't come up with it, but I'll do it on my show.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  All right, man, take care.  All right, Louis.  All right. 
[00:09:00]  The Latinos kind of took part of it and ran with it.  It was called the Puerto Rican Day Parade here in New York.  It's got nothing to do with that.  Yeah, believe me.  No, I know, man.  Cow does whip them out Wednesday, making believe it's his.  Please.  There's a show in San Francisco that does it, and they're making believe it's theirs.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  And we're going to be on in San Francisco in a few days, so we'll be able to finally tell  everyone in San Francisco where the idea came from, then you've got other guys like  Tom Lickass, Tom Likas, who, you know, decided, well, maybe if I just change it to Flash 
[00:09:30]  them out Fridays, no one will know the difference.  Flash them Fridays.  Please.  And then there's a show in Vegas, and we're going to be on in Vegas in the very near future.  Very good.  We've got to hit all the cities that have guys doing the whip them out Wednesday thing.  Yep.  And I challenge any of these guys to prove that they came up with this before we did.  Yeah, show us some documented evidence, like the newspaper clippings or something that  we had from Boston.  You mean our newspaper clippings that go back about six years? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, okay.  Corey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Just want to say two things.  Yeah.  You guys are taking over the radio.  Howard Stern doesn't stand a chance.  And thanks for coming to PA, man.  You guys are great.  We're loving PA so far, man.  Hey, we're loving you guys.  Have a good night, guys.  Thank you.  All right, bye-bye.  All right, bye.  We aren't even on in the same part of the day as Howard.  Right.  Yeah.  One big happy family, isn't it?  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  What?  Huh?  What was that?  So there you have it.  It's whipping my Wednesday.  You know the deal in the new cities.  You just put the wow in the back of your car and go about your business, and you just  might see something, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Anthony, interesting breaking news from CBS.  CBS.  The TV station, obviously.  Yeah.  Has anyone else checked out Big Brother 2 yet?  I have not checked it out yet.  I must say, it's a huge improvement from Big Brother.  Oh, really?  Remember we had Arnold Shapiro, the executive producer, on our show, and we were trashing 
[00:11:00]  him and stuff?  I'm definitely hooked.  Definitely into it.  Are you?  Definitely entertained.  More things going on in the house?  Well, they just got a bunch of horny people in the house.  Yeah.  There's all sorts of action going on already.  People are getting topless.  This is all what the show should be about.  Mm-hmm.  Remember the first one, they just sat around talking about nonsense?  Well, there was that thrilling segment where they put together a puzzle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who wants to watch people putting together a puzzle? 
[00:11:30]  No offense to our buddy, our pal, who won the whole thing, Eddie, but this one is much,  much better.  Much better.  The house is decorated better.  The individuals are more interesting.  There's some sex going on.  They're all hooking up.  They're getting naked.  Oh, yeah.  They're just all sleeping with each other in their beds and stuff.  Yeah.  Co-ed.  But you're hearing it here first.  One of the guys got kicked out, and you don't even know about it yet.  Yeah.  This is behind-the-scenes stuff. 
[00:12:00]  And someone sent us a clip, and we don't know where we got it from, but we got an actual  clip of this guy, Justin, who's from Jersey.  Yeah.  Bayonne, right?  From Bayonne.  From Bayonne, Jersey.  He is such a dick.  The guy is just, he walks around all the time with his shirt off, and he just thinks he's  an incredible ladies' man.  He calls himself Justin Credible.  Get it? 
[00:12:30]  Justin Credible.  That's what he calls himself.  Oh, you guys got to watch the show, because there's a bunch of guys that think their ass  don't stink.  There's another guy that thinks he's Justin Bateman from American Psycho.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's a doctor and completely full of himself.  He spends, like, a long time in the mirror primping himself to look as well as he can.  I'll use a pumice watch.  Right, right.  This card, the color is bone.  Right.  I forgot the guy's name, but this guy is just full of himself.  Yeah.  Convince all the 14-year-old girls out there already love him. 
[00:13:00]  Well, this Justin guy comes off as like a real nutcase.  All he does is lift all day long.  Yeah, like he's on some kind of, like he comes off like a guy that's on roid rage, you know?  Right.  Like he's just crazy.  He threatened this guy.  I don't know all the names yet, but I think his name is Ken.  He's like 45, 46-year-old real estate mortgage broker.  Yeah.  Ken accused Justin of taking his pillow two days in a row.  His pillow?  Yeah, and it was only one day in a row. 
[00:13:30]  One day in a row.  One day, excuse me.  So Justin got pissed off, got right in his face, and basically said, you better stand  up because I'm going to kick your ass.  Really?  Yeah.  And then what happened?  Then the guy stood up with a weak fist, like getting in the position to maybe fight him.  Yeah.  And then back down in front of like a couple of the other housemates looking just completely  ridiculous.  Oh, and Justin walks back in the house all, what a dick, you know?  With his shirt on and his muscles pop in like, yeah, I showed him.  Yeah, the guy wants to come off like that, and, you know, I hate people like that. 
[00:14:00]  Jesus Christ.  Good.  So, uh, Justin's gone.  Yeah, Justin's gone.  I don't know how they're going to handle it on CBS.  I'm assuming they're going to show the clip that we got a hold of.  Yeah.  He's with Krista, who he's been, uh, canoodling with.  Yeah, Krista's from like, she's from New Orleans?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's like a country girl, really.  I don't even think she's from the city, like the burbs of New Orleans or something.  They're talking and kissing and whatnot.  You know, and he's just like loud and obnoxious and kind of like got this violent undertone 
[00:14:30]  about him, you know?  So, at one point, uh, she says something.  He gets a little agitated with what she's saying.  Not really in a bad way, because he's still kissing her.  Uh, she's laying...  Yeah, you should explain.  They're just making out on the, um, the island.  The island in the middle of the kitchen, you know, uses a chopping block or something.  And she looks completely hammered.  I don't know if he was hammered.  He didn't really look it.  But she definitely was sauced.  So, she's laying down on that thing.  When he walks away, he picks up this carpet sweeper thing, you know? 
[00:15:00]  Like the thing you go over a carpet to clean it up with.  And, uh, goes, how about I just cave your head in with this thing?  Now, who does he think he is?  Norton?  He was kind of joking, but in a...  I don't know, man.  And he goes, wham!  You know, and he goes a slow motion swing at her head.  He goes like, wham!  Yeah!  Uh, so then he puts the carpet sweeper down.  He goes, uh, how, what would you think if I killed you?  And he's, but he's kissing her and, like, talking with her.  He goes, what if I killed you?  And he grabs, picks up a knife.  Big, friggin' knife. 
[00:15:30]  And walks over to her, puts the knife right to her throat, the blade right to her throat,  and goes, what would you think if I killed you?  And she goes...  What an idiot.  She goes, uh, I don't care.  I don't care.  Go ahead.  He goes, all right.  And he kind of gets behind her and grabs the knife and puts it to her throat.  Right.  And I guess CBS might have a problem with this.  And then, um, yeah.  I don't understand.  Yeah.  That was my favorite part of the show.  But he's a pussy.  He didn't go through with it. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, so he's got the neck to, uh, the neck, the knife to her, uh, neck.  Yeah.  And then he's making out with her and basically saying, you know, what would you do if I killed you?  And she goes, I wouldn't care.  I wouldn't care.  And then she goes, do it.  Do it.  Yeah, do it.  And he puts the knife right to her throat and starts, like, you can see he actually made  contact with the blade in her, uh, her neck.  Right.  So they had problems.  And, um, I guess he's gone.  Yeah, they kicked him out of the house just like that.  So, I don't know.  I don't know how they're going to handle it on the next Big Brother.  When is that?  On Thursday?  Yeah.  The next episode? 
[00:16:30]  Well, that's, uh, breaking news.  Breaking news.  Justin from Bayonne, New Jersey.  Yeah.  He's out of the Big Brother house.  Yeah.  For putting a knife to Krista's neck.  Like, I wish I'd been watching so I could really give a flying F, you know, that he's  kicked out.  But I really don't care.  The guy just looked like a real dick.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, guys.  What's going on, man?  Hey.  Yo, uh, what did you like to call this show?  MPV's Real World?  It sucks.  Let me tell you, it sucks. 
[00:17:00]  And Little Joe Pinto rocks.  Little Joe Pinto rocks, baby.  What the hell is Little Joe Pinto, you ass?  Little Joe Pinto is the best, one of the best local rock bands in Philadelphia, man.  You can check him out at littlejoepinto.com.  I'm telling you, you see, Melissa, you tell him the next time she comes up to me.  Bang, bang, bang, bang.  What a douchebag.  If you want to talk about your band, you call up and talk about your band.  Don't go, you know, I want to talk about Big Brother and then sneak it in. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  What a dick tool.  Kick him off the show.  Everybody should just go to the next show and just tell them how much they suck.  Yeah, show up for one show.  Why?  Maybe the band's cool and that guy's just the a-hole.  He's probably one of the douchebag friends that you've got to, like, deal with.  What a jerk.  God, I hate that.  Luke, what's going on?  Hey, no, much.  How are you?  We're doing good.  Okay.  I was wondering if I could get some WOW stickers. 
[00:18:00]  Well, you're calling from Cleveland, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, Cleveland doesn't have the WOW stickers yet.  But you know what?  The WOW thing works just as well with homemade WOW signs.  I'm telling you, we love when people make homemade WOW signs.  Yep.  Okay.  It's even cooler, actually.  I mean, to this day, because we have bumper stickers all over New York that say WOW on  them.  But when I see, like, somebody with masking tape on the back of their car that says WOW,  I think that is so effing cool to this day.  All right.  But if you want one of our WOW stickers from New York, just send a self-addressed stamped  envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106. 
[00:18:30]  Okay.  All right, Luke.  Yeah, thanks.  That address is on our website as well, so.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, bro.  Yep.  Getting a lot of support from Cleveland is pretty damn cool.  Yeah.  Cleveland definitely coming aboard.  Is this true?  I'm hearing that Bellevue Angela, this is a rumor I'd like her to call, went into Bar 9  last night.  We all hung out at Bar 9 last night, by the way.  My brother was playing.  We drank a lot and had a lot of fun there very late. 
[00:19:00]  But I heard after we left, Angela came running in with police after her because she skipped  out on paying a cab fare.  And she was all crying.  Yeah, that seems like she's got problems again.  I don't know if that's true or not.  I'd like to hear somebody confirm that.  We had Angela crying on the show yesterday by accident.  Oh, my God.  We didn't mean to make her cry.  Because we played the Daddy's Home song that she's very touchy about in the Bellevue special. 
[00:19:30]  But we've done that plenty of times.  But this time, she was a little upset.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  I think when we get back, we're going to announce the winner of the Moms I Like to  F Con.  Oh, that's right.  We're wrapping that up today.  Voting close, Opie?  Is the voting close?  Let me see.  I got the final votes in front of me here.  You do?  Very close?  Oh, yeah.  It was, yeah, sure.  It was close.  This thing isn't even close.  What?  Stop it.  It's really close.  Look. 
[00:20:00]  Just stop.  Look.  Look at that total.  That's close.  Get out of here.  We'll announce the winner of the contest.  Yeah.  In just a bit.  Okay?  All right.  Yes, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Very excited.  If you're seeing anything on the highways today, please give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Let them hang like the animals they are.

That was a great movie.  So twisted.  All right, we're moments away from hopefully getting the winners of the Moms I'd Like to  F contest on the phone line so we can talk to them.  Grand prize is a trip to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  I wonder who won. 
[00:23:00]  Thank you, Spirit Airlines.  Wow, I'm having such a hard time figuring out the winner.  It really is no surprise.  Dude.  No.  Really?  Really?  I'll be honest.  I could have went either way with those two ladies.  You got to understand, though, it's a mom contest.  This isn't the hottest chick contest.  You have to take this in the context that these are moms. 
[00:23:30]  Who's the hottest mom on this?  Right?  Yeah, but the other one's pretty hot, too.  Oh, I realize.  I know.  Second place is really hot as well.  You're making it sound like no one had a chance in this contest.  The voting?  The voting was close.  Look, it's right here.  The voting is so not close.  When you look at it in bar graph form.  It's close, man.  It's ridiculous.  It's close. 
[00:24:00]  Let me see.  All right.  Let me just see the numbers.  All right.  This is today's votes in the last 24 hours.  Uh-huh.  And this is the votes from the 24 hours before that.  All right.  And then you add them up.  And it's close.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that's real close.  Right?  Yes, they're all numbers.  All right.  That's close.  Before we get the winners on the phone, we're having a tough time tracking them down. 
[00:24:30]  We want to replay the Sandy Cain thing from yesterday because everyone's talking about it.  It was pretty late yesterday.  We love Sandy Cain, don't we, Anthony?  No, I find her completely heinous.  She was down at Bar 9 last night.  Sandy Cain went down at Bar 9?  She showed up and people were just like running away from her.  She's sitting on the couch.  I get up on stage.  I'm like, how come usually when we're here on Tuesday night, everyone's sitting on the  couches? 
[00:25:00]  She was alone on the couch.  No one wanted to sit next to her.  They're all like cramped in, standing room only.  And there's three couches wide open.  No one wanted to sit on.  Well, would you sit next to someone with genital warts?  Did she have her fright wig on?  No, she took the fright wig off.  Which is even worse.  And her real hair is worse than the fright wig. 
[00:25:30]  It looked the same.  Like I couldn't tell.  No, no, no, no.  No.  How old do you think she is?  83.  Gotta be close.  She's gotta be at least 60, right?  At least 60?  You think she's older than 60?  Yeah.  Although you gotta take into consideration she has ridden hard and put up wet for many  years.  Big time.  Big time.  Maybe 60 then.  But hard as 60.  Supposedly she still works the peep shows. 
[00:26:00]  And she came in here yesterday.  She wanted to sing a Jerry Seinfeld song.  And the one problem with Sandy Cain, we love her and stuff.  I mean, she gives us good radio.  Yeah.  But she just doesn't understand broadcast standards and every other word is just something we  have to dump out of.  Yeah.  And it gets really frustrating to you and I.  Well, because she then, after you tell her what the word she said was and that she can't  say it anymore, she will repeat the word. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, I can't say, uh-huh.  And you're like, no, stop.  Don't say it.  Right.  Oh, uh-huh.  Right.  Right.  It gets very frustrating.  And every time we dump out of the show, you're losing a lot of material.  Yeah.  Four or five seconds at a time, which is a lot.  Right.  So we got so frustrated because then she starts singing the Seinfeld song and then she starts  using words you can't use.  Yeah.  So then we basically told her if, you know, she could sing her song, but if we had to  dump out of the show again, we were going to just start throwing crap at her. 
[00:27:00]  So we all picked up stuff and waited for her to say a bad word.  Right.  So this is how it went down yesterday.  Check it out.  Sandy Kane is ready.  I'm here.  She's ready to sing her, uh, she wants to sing her Jerry Seinfeld song, Anthony.  We got her music ready and I don't know why she...  Oh, my God.  Horrible.  Horrible.  What are the...  I smell vermin poontang.  Anyway.  All right.  Sandy, I'm going to start your music, okay?  Okay, baby. 
[00:27:30]  Another current song.  There she goes.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you f*** me tonight?  No, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What are you...  Don't talk.  Don't say anything like, can't you say, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:28:00]  Don't...  Hey, shut up.  Hey, she...  Shut up.  Shush, shush, shush.  You can't say that.  You can't say the...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Holy...  F!  Sandy.  Shut up.  Don't...  You can't say the...  Jesus!  Come on.  All right, look, look.  I'm breathing.  I want to punch you in the face.  Killer.  Killer, Anthony.  Listen to me.  Why can't you shut your f***ing trap?  How come when I'm saying you can't say something, you then say that word? 
[00:28:30]  Don't say it.  Shut up!  Don't say anything.  Now, don't say it.  The C word you said can't be said.  Don't say it!  I see you gearing up to say it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What did you throw at her?  What was that?  Cars.  Nice.  That was a near one.  That's your...  Sandy.  That's your Jerry Seinfeld music.  You can't say...  Oh, that was her music? 
[00:29:00]  Wow.  Nice rage.  That was beautiful.  Wow.  You got some kind of disorder.  No.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  She dresses up to it.  No, but the lyrics are, come out tonight.  Yeah, I know, but you didn't say, come out tonight.  Now, shut up.  Hey, you used the other version of that word, and you put it in a context.  Can I do it again?  Not that way?  Don't you want it on the air?  Yeah, I do.  No, but I mean, I'll do it...  Look, I don't...  You guys got me so horny that I had to do it that way. 
[00:29:30]  I am so horny that I had to say it that way.  Well, okay, look, look...  Can I just do it one more time?  Let's do it back up.  Let's play a game.  If we have to dump out of you one more time in the show, we get to throw stuff at you.  Tell O and A, I always like them.  Everyone pick up something you're going to throw at Sandy if she gets dumped out of again.  This is what we do.  This is what we do now.  See, this is what we do now to you.  Can I do this topless?  We do now to you this now.  I got to do topless. 
[00:30:00]  All right.  I can't help it, man.  And she's got innies.  You see that?  What happened to those things?  What happened?  They never came out.  They never came out.  They never developed.  Yeah.  I'm still waiting.  Was that the suction that happened when your uterus fell out?  It just pulled everything in?  I don't know what happened to me.  Is that what happened?  It's been a tough life.  They never developed.  They never came out.  Sandy, there's a handsome can driver by Central Park called.  I need the right man.  He needs you.  He's got a family of purists.  I need you to trot them through the park.  Now I can sing. 
[00:30:30]  Now I can sing.  All right.  Is it all queued up yet?  Yeah.  We're going to do it again.  Let's try.  Now, look.  Here's the game.  I'm going to throw a scissor.  I have a half full bottle of Coke.  Ben's got a videotape.  Otto, George.  Scissor?  Yeah.  Violent show.  Do you have a CD or something?  I don't want to.  Violent show.  No, you want to hurt him.  Empty bottle.  I can't hang my fun bags in Brooklyn.  All right.  We're going to try the song again, Sandy.  Okay?  Violent people.  Ooh.  All right.  Who wants to throw the Magic 8 ball? 
[00:31:00]  I'll do it.  Shoot.  All right.  Here we go.  Give me something hot and moderate to heavy.  Moderate to heavy.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't get dumped at them.  Watch those words.  Here she goes.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Throw it.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld.  Throw it now.  Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you come out tonight? 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Jerry, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld.  Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come out tonight.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Won't you come out tonight?  Jerry, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Why don't you come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, you can bring Opie and Anthony, too. 
[00:32:00]  Bring Otto and bring George, too.  And you can ring Rick Delgado.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Jerry, Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, can we just throw things at her anyway?  I'm out tonight.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  She's got hard.  Come, Jerry, baby. 
[00:32:30]  Just keep things at her anyway.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Well, then, you can bring Jerry Seinfeld.  You can bring Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Jerry Seinfeld.  I'm Jerry Seinfeld.  I'm Jerry Seinfeld.  You can bring Jerry Seinfeld. 
[00:33:00]  That you, oh, oh, oh.  Jerry.  Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Come, Jerry Seinfeld.  Come Jerry Seinfeld, why don't you come out tonight?  Come Jerry Seinfeld, ooh.  Bring Opie and Anthony, too.  Come Jerry Seinfeld, baby.  Bring Opie and Anthony, too. 
[00:33:30]  Bring Jerry, what do you say to you?  She's durable.  Yeah, you're throwing stuff at a chick that's probably used to taking right hooks.  22nd and 8th I worked for 10 years.  So you're used to things being thrown at you?  22nd and 8th and comedy clubs.  Oh, my God.  How close did the scissors come?  Not close enough. 
[00:34:00]  There you have it from yesterday, man.  Oh, my God.  That was unbelievable.  Well, Steve, you got video of that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of video.  Actually, a lot of it's shaky because I think it was Ann pelted me with a cardboard box.  Yeah, you were kind of getting in for a close shot.  Oh, I looked down over here because I ran out of stuff to throw at her.  I looked down here.  There's an entire box full of junk sitting here.  It's got to be a two-foot by two-foot box.  Yeah, easily.  I picked the whole box up and threw it at her. 
[00:34:30]  And it hit Steve.  I don't care.  I was laughing my ass off the entire time, but there's like this Blair Witch part of the  videotape that's just me going down, getting hit with a cardboard box.  I hear the clip when the wiffle ball bat hit her in the head.  It's really funny.  That is hysterical.  I threw the bat at her and it took off like a spear and hit her right in the side of the head.  Just dunk off the side of her, off the side of her temple.  I threw Ben's, I threw Ben's stool.  Chair.  Chair.  Well, now it's a chair. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And then you threw the coffee out of the iced coffee.  It went all over the front of us.  Coffee with a chair.  We were all having a good time laughing our asses off as stuff is flying everywhere and Ben's  on the floor trying to figure out how to put his chair back together.  And she's still singing the entire time.  I know.  That's what amazed me.  She was being hit with this stuff.  And she just kept singing.  The only time she missed the beat was two seconds when I hit her in the side of the head with  the bat.  That's when she kind of slipped up a bit.  I wish you were outside the studio because afterwards she's sitting on the lesbian couch 
[00:35:30]  out there and I go up to Sandy.  I'm like, hey man, thanks.  That was, you know, that was cool.  Nice song.  You know, totally BS.  Blah, blah, yeah.  She looks at me and she goes, she calls us all gorgeous.  She goes, thanks gorgeous.  She goes, do you want a job?  Oh, sorry I missed it.  So I go, so I go, no.  And without missing a beat, she goes, what?  You don't like jobs?  I go, well, that's really not the problem. 
[00:36:00]  I'm from you.  She doesn't get it.  She kissed Rick.  She kissed you?  Rick.  Made out with her.  Made out with her.  No, we didn't make out, Ben, you dick.  No.  How is those tongue, how is your tongue going over those teeth?  I was trying to get her out of here because it was like 7.15 already.  Yeah.  And she was still hanging around.  So I was like, come on, Sandy.  I'll show you the quick way out.  You know, whatever.  Get her to the door.  And she's like, let me get a kiss. 
[00:36:30]  I'm like, no, that's okay.  I'm like, and I'm trying to push her away.  And she like, she went through my face, but I pulled away and she got me right here in  the neck.  I was just like, oh.  You're infected.  Probably.  Dude, you're probably going to get a big twotto.  Oh, I got a new Sandy sound, too.  Oh, you do?  New Sandy sound.  Brand new Sandy.  Oh, my God.  We love new Sandy.  Sounds good.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah, we got some really good ones.  All right, baby.  Ah.  Ah. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, ah.  Ow.  Ah.  Ah.  Ow.  Ow.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ow.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  Oh, ah.  That was my favorite.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ooh.  Carmen, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Remember me, Carmen?  Are you a guy or a girl?  I'm a girl.  Remember with the big ass?  Are you going to fling me across the street? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, we don't like her.  Oh, yeah, we don't like you.  But I like you guys now.  I don't give a flying F.  I like you.  Stop.  You can't say that.  Oh, I can't say that?  Why are you guys doing this to Sandy Kane now?  Uh, that's mean.  No, it's not.  She doesn't know what's going on.  That's not mean if the person doesn't, uh, understand what's going on.  All right.  Bye, Carmen.  Bye-bye.  Man, I'm choking on something. 
[00:38:00]  Whew.  All right.  Anyway, let's announce the winner of the Moms That Like To Have Contest.  Yeah.  Finally, today, the day has come.  Here we go.  Let me pop up all the, uh, the remaining finalists.  Yeah, we're down to five finalists, and now we got our first, second, and third place to  announce here today.  Of course, the finalists in no particular order was, um, Allison.  You might remember her.  Mm-hmm.  The mom who had won the, um, Best Ass Contest and has the, uh, daughter that's, um, a big 
[00:38:30]  gal, as I said, which caused so much controversy when they were in last time.  And then, uh, we have Angela from Bellevue.  Who might be in jail today.  We don't know where Angela is, because now I'm getting reports that she ran into Bar 9,  cops chasing her, because she ran out on, uh, uh, cab fare.  And then Froy was just saying she ran downstairs in Bar 9, ran back up, sat on the couch for  ten seconds, then bolted out the front door. 
[00:39:00]  So we don't know what's happening with, uh, crazy Angela.  And we can't get her on the phone today, so we're hoping that everything's okay with Angela.  Then, of course, uh, Jeannie.  Jeannie!  Jeannie!  Jeannie!  She's the blonde.  Uh, very, very attractive girl.  I love Jeannie.  Mm-hmm.  Um, can I, can I interrupt you for a second?  Sure.  Annoying laugh, Anthony is here.  Eee!  Wearing a suit and tie and stuff.  Here, grab that mic.  There you go.  Eee! 
[00:39:30]  Why are you running in with water?  Because you were choking.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know you had your big...  Brown nose!  Pussy fat!  Brown nose!  I didn't know you had that.  It comes running in with water, and we're trying to do a radio show.  And he's like, he's like this, Anthony.  He was, I know.  Take my bottle of water!  He's, he's so helpful.  Dude.  Every couple weeks, he's like, you guys need an extra intern?  Like an intern pick.  What's wrong?  He's being, uh, helpful. 
[00:40:00]  He thought Opie was choking.  But he's, look, how big is this bottle of water in front of me?  I didn't see it.  What's the problem?  I didn't see it.  It's like, it takes for nothing!  Brown nose!  Me crab!  Thank you, annoying laugh, Anthony.  You're welcome.  All right.  Friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  Yes.  What a stupid voice.  What a stupid laugh.  Me crab!  All right, Anthony.  You were saying Jeannie.  Jeannie, the, uh, attractive blonde girl. 
[00:40:30]  Mm-hmm.  Then there's, uh, Jennifer.  You'll remember her.  She came in in the little bikini number.  Looking very good.  All these pictures are up on WNEW.com.  And, of course, um, the last contestant to show up, I think, for the contest, right?  Yes.  Uh, Neo.  Right.  Who, um, really, really doesn't even look like a mom.  And she had that baby because her boyfriend, or her husband, uh, got her pregnant so she couldn't leave him. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he wanted a long-term contract.  He wanted to be in for the long haul.  And he didn't want this one to get away.  No, so he knocked her up.  So, those are your finalists.  So, Anthony, coming in third place.  Oh, are you going to do it backwards fashion?  Uh, no, I'm just going to kind of throw it out there because we've got some of the ladies on, um, hold here.  Third place.  Third place goes to Jennifer.  Jennifer gets third place.  I don't know what she wins, but she wins something. 
[00:41:30]  Bravo, Jennifer.  Gift certificates from, um, I don't know.  Thanks to that sponsor for helping us out.  I don't know.  Shavers.com?  No?  We don't even know.  Nothing.  One of our contestants is, uh, calling in here.  Uh, who's this?  Oh, uh, Jeannie.  Hello.  Hi, Jeannie.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hello.  You're the blonde in the contest?  Yes, I am.  And I must say, you were my favorite, Jeannie. 
[00:42:00]  Well, thank you.  Ooh, look at that.  Do you have a soft spot for blondes?  Um.  I guess I was hoping for the blonde vote.  The blonde vote.  Well, um, I guess you got the blonde vote.  Jeannie?  Yes?  You came in second place.  Oh, a close second.  Excellent.  Second place.  Second place, Jeannie, the blonde.  Which means you get the Samsung DVD slash, um, uh, VCR player.  I really wanted the DVD player. 
[00:42:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really, really cool, this thing, isn't it?  DVD player and a VCR all in one, so you don't got to go, um, fussing with wires or anything  like that, if you will.  Excellent.  You're not, uh, sad that you didn't get the trip to Myrtle Beach?  No.  I was really, when I got, when we got down to the top three, I just really thought it  would go either way.  Right.  Because I thought, you know, the other two were really pretty.  Yeah.  The voting was very close.  Yeah.  Very close.  Very close.  For second place.  You got second place, Jeannie, all right? 
[00:43:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, you're the one that brought your kids while the three miles were going at it on the  Lesbian Challenge.  Oh, right.  You might remember that, everyone.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Jeannie's kids were running around with a little ball outside the studio.  Yeah.  While mommies were getting busy in the studio.  Completely oblivious.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Well, congratulations.  Uh, stay on hold so we can get some info from you.  Okay, thank you.  There goes our second place winner, Anthony.  Well, that only leaves.  Jeannie.  First place.  Who could it be?  Uh, well, her husband is on the line. 
[00:43:30]  Ah.  Louie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Your hot piece of ass wife, Neo, has won the contest.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Yes.  She's not even here, man.  I know.  Where is she?  She's probably on the road on the way back here listening, and she's probably freaking  out in the car and going to crash.  How does it feel that so many people in seven different cities want to F your wife?  Kind of dirty.  That's the mom's, uh, the mom that, uh, everyone wants to F is your wife.  Hey, that's cool, man.  See?  And you got a trip to, uh, Myrtle Beach.  Yeah, you guys are great, man. 
[00:44:00]  Thanks, and thanks to everybody who voted.  Five days, four nights, Myrtle Beach, and we want to thank Spirit, uh, Airlines for helping  us out.  Cool.  Spirit Air dot com.  All right?  Yes.  Uh, I'll probably have her call you guys back.  Yeah, we'd love to talk to her today.  We don't want to talk about you, uh, talk to you.  I know.  I'm not interested.  When was the last time you had some sex with her?  Uh, I can't tell.  That should kill me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That means last night.  That was last night.  There you go.  All right, uh, Louie?  Yep.  Congratulations.  Thank you, guys.  Stay on hold, and please get her to call us, okay? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, no problem.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Oh, stop.  That takes the hotness away.  And there's the kid, just in case you thought, uh, they might have fixed the contest.  So there you have it, Anthony.  Yeah, first place, Neo.  Second place, uh, Jeannie.  Third place, Jennifer.  I got to take a break.  There's something in my throat.  Anthony.  Limo Anthony, please.  Get Opie some water. 
[00:45:00]  Stinky comes flying in.  Well, he's imitating, uh, annoying live Anthony.  He's ripping you off.  You're ripping you off.  Thanks, uh, Anthony, for running in with the water.  I thought you were choking.  I thought you were choking.  I wish you were choking.  I wish you were choking.  All right.  Uh, Rick, grab that mic.  We may have some good news, Anthony.  You know we've been talking about cripple bouts for a while now.  Cripple bouts.  We have a bunch of blind guys that are going to be boxing in the very near future. 
[00:45:30]  That may go down tomorrow.  That's going to happen tomorrow.  I got definite confirmation from both Dave and then blind Matt, who called in yesterday.  Very cool.  So, uh, two blind guys who've been trash-talking each other will be going at it tomorrow right  here on this show.  You better call your friends and tell them that Opie and Anthony are doing blind boxing  tomorrow on the radio, okay?  Yes.  But today?  Today we have a surprise.  What do we got?  We got one-legged guys.  We got a couple of one-legged guys.  We got a couple of one-legged guys. 
[00:46:00]  One's already here.  The other guy's, uh, he's on his way up the block.  He's about a mile or so away.  Are they going to beat the crap out of each other?  They're going to beat the hell out of each other.  Oh, great.  So, man, we got the gloves and the headgear.  How are we going to handle this?  We're going to give them gloves and headgear and let them pummel each other.  Yeah, but I mean, like, uh, best out of three, you know, first guy falls down, he loses.  Falls down.  And to do it three times?  Three falls?  Dude.  They have one leg.  They can fall in two seconds.  Yeah, they're hopping, man. 
[00:46:30]  What are the rules?  Boxing rules or, uh, ultimate fighting rules?  Uh, three one-minute rounds?  Three one-minute rounds.  I don't know.  First one down.  I think they fight until someone falls.  To the death.  And it's best, uh, best out of three.  Best out of three falls?  So the first guy to fall twice loses.  Whoever rips the other one's good leg off him.  What are the odds these guys are going to fall?  Pretty good, right?  Pretty damn good, yeah.  Okay.  They've had no one leg for a while, though.  Maybe they're good at it.  Yeah, but that's why the boxing, you know, you're knocking the other guy off balance. 
[00:47:00]  All right.  Okay, but then after they fall, that's like the end of a round, and they've got to take  a little breather, maybe.  Well, the first guy that falls down twice loses.  Okay.  I don't think it's going to take much time.  No?  No.  They might fall just by swinging.  Yeah, you never know.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  You ever try swinging on one leg?  On one leg, no.  Kind of need that second leg to kind of, you know, balance off.  That sounds legit.  All right, we'll talk to these guys next. 
[00:47:30]  And quickly, Noel in a wheelchair wants to do jousting.  We already have one guy that wants to do wheelchair jousting.  Make sure Noel doesn't go away.  Yeah, we're getting her info.  Uh, Noel.  Yes.  You want to joust?  You want to joust with the other guy?  Yes, even though I'm not in his weight class anymore.  Uh, how much do you weigh?  Now?  Uh, 311.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty big, too.  That's pretty big.  And what's your injury?  My knees are shattered. 
[00:48:00]  I have osteoarthritis both knees, so I can't use them.  Another guy that is too big for his knees.  All right, that's going to be the wheelchair jousting.  But I'm shrinking steadily.  All right.  All right, hold on the line.  We'll get you down here for wheelchair jousting.  Okay.  All right, cool.  There's Noel.  Cool.  Oh, Noel.  Noel, Noel, sorry.  Clear throat.  All right.  Nice.  I'm psyched for the jousting thing.  We've got to get that hooked up. 
[00:48:30]  Well, one leg fighting next.  One leg fighting is going to be great, too.  We've got to set up the mics outside the studio.  We'll be all set and ready to go after we take a quick break.  Cripple bounce.  A little John Valby as we go to commercial.  I was out on a date in my daddy's car.  I picked her up in the New York bar.  I f***ed her.  A slit she didn't let out a peep.  I had my junk in her throat too deep.  I was f***ing her face. 
[00:49:00]  My junk started to spit.  The doctor said the b***h had an epileptic fit.  Well, where, oh, where can my p***er be?  The b***h bit it right off of me.  Here I stand with two balls and a p***.  Please, Fat X, be my p***er when you take your next dog.  Cha-cha-cha. 
[00:49:30]  Rip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One day in school.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  The copy's wrong, so just talk about Sam Adams for 60 seconds.  Oh, really?  Well, maybe not.  Well, I don't know.  The pitcher-pitcher tie-in?  Maybe they still want us to talk about that.  You can choose which pitcher you'd like to share a pitcher of Sam Adams with 
[00:50:00]  if you go to samadams.com for their survey.  And maybe even if that's not running anymore because the All-Star game was last night.  Maybe you'll find some fun things at samadams.com.  I don't know.  I haven't been there.  I'm usually drinking Sam Adams, so I don't visit their website.  Makes it very hard to navigate a web thing when you're drinking a lot of Sam Adams.  I love it.  You'll love it, too.  So whatever you're doing this summer, bring Sam Adams along with you. 
[00:50:30]  Go to the store, pick some up, bring it home with you like I do.  I like a nice six of Sam Adams always in my fridge.  Or if you go out to the bar, what are Sam Adams?  You're going to love it.  Sam Adams.  Mmm.  Sam Adams.  Our, our, our, our, our, by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  U-2 Elevation for the Tomb Raider soundtrack. 
[00:51:00]  Tomb Raider, the worst movie I've seen this summer so far.  That bad.  Ah.  Ah.  Final Fantasy getting mixed reviews in the paper today.  I'll go see that.  Looks kind of cold.  Uh, Opie, of course, we, uh, just announced the winner of the Moms I'd Like to F contest.  The winner, Neo.  And then, uh, coming in second was, uh, Jeannie.  And third was Jennifer. 
[00:51:30]  Now the people start, uh, start writing and saying how, uh, upset they are.  What is this?  Jeannie is so much better than Neo.  I want a Jeannie.  Jeannie is coming from a Larry.  Jeannie is all that.  It should have went Jeannie, Jennifer, then Neo.  I'm really bummed.  Well, the people spoke.  Yeah, this is a democracy.  You guys decided.  They voted.  What the F?  Are you kidding me?  What happened to Allison?  Guys, Jesus, H. 
[00:52:00]  A lot of upset people.  How the F did Allison not win?  You guys suck.  It had nothing to do with it.  We put their faces up on a website.  You guys voted for your favorite.  This, I think this sucks.  She's hardly even a milf.  She's still just a hot piece of ass, though.  But she has a kid.  Officially, she's a mom.  Toll free, 877-692-1027 is our phone number.  Lots going on today, Anthony.  I can't even tell you, man.  It's Whip'Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:52:30]  The people that have been with us for a while, they understand what that means, and they're  very happy that it's Wednesday.  For all the new cities, it's a very, very simple, simple concept.  You put wow on the back of your car.  You spell it out any way you want.  I mean, meaning any way, like with masking tape, you want to paint it on, you want to  put a decal, whatever.  Get it on your vehicle.  Some people have license plates that just say, wow, it's pretty damn cool.  Yeah.  And the ladies, when they see you with a wow on the back of your car, if they feel like 
[00:53:00]  it, they're going to flash you their boobs on the way home from work.  It's a great little treat to make the commute a little easier.  And this damn thing works like a charm.  Trust me.  Yep.  Two simple rules.  Do not harass the ladies.  Do not follow the ladies.  Just put the wow in your car, and then go about your business, and you might be pleasantly  surprised in the near future.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  So that's going on.  We're also getting ready for our first cripple bout, a little concept that we kind of started  developing earlier this week.  We've got a couple guys that are going to be fighting tomorrow. 
[00:53:30]  Uh-huh.  They're blind.  Blind boxing tomorrow.  Gotta love that.  Today, we've got two one-legged guys that are going to fight it out.  And they're both here.  And they're both here.  Both here.  The other one-legged guy just walked in.  We're getting them situated and filling out their proper forms.  Mm-hmm.  And then we'll bring them in.  Nice.  Very good.  Finally.  Boxing ring is set up.  Great.  But before that, Anthony, we have another exclusive for everyone.  What do we got? 
[00:54:00]  God, I love pissing people off.  What now?  Even if we work for the same company.  Mm-hmm.  We were talking about Big Brother 2?  Yep.  From this moment on, Rick and everyone else, do not answer a phone.  See how this works?  Do not answer a phone.  Of course I got it off the internet.  It's all over the place.  Yes.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  That's exactly where we got this clip from.  Do not answer your pagers.  Do not answer the phones until we're done with the next 10 minutes of radio.  Big Brother 2 is on CBS, Anthony.  Yeah.  And it's going pretty well so far.  I like this installment of Big Brother better than the first one that they did last year.  Oh, yeah.  We were just telling a story.  Want to tell it again in case people are tuning in for the first time?  About Justin?  Yes.  Justin from Big Brother was with Krista making out in the kitchen on one of those little islands in the middle of the kitchen. 
[00:55:00]  Justin is like a musclehead from Bayonne, New Jersey.  Yeah, he comes off looking like somebody on the roid rage.  Just lifts weights all day long.  Yeah, he kind of has some anger tone.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been in a lot of people's faces.  I don't know if anyone has checked out Big Brother 2 yet, but you should because it's pretty damn good.  So he's making out with this girl, Krista.  Right.  And then she says something.  He gets a little miffed by it and picks up a carpet sweeper and goes, how about I cave your head in or swing this at your head or something? 
[00:55:30]  And he slow motion does it to her head.  And then later on, he's kissing her again and says, how would you feel if I killed you?  Or something to that effect.  Then picks up a knife and puts it right up to her throat.  Right up to her throat.  Yeah.  And then he's kind of making out with her as the knife is up against her throat.  Yep.  And then says something like, how would you feel if I killed you?  Yeah.  And she says something like, I don't care. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  I was waiting for him to just slit her throat.  Yeah, it was pretty, this clip is pretty wild to watch.  That would have been great if he just looked in one of the cameras and went, okay.  Then he said something like, no, really, what would you do if I killed you?  And she said, I don't care.  Do it.  Yeah.  Do it.  And then like a pussy backed out, but he couldn't close the deal like O.J.  So, um, we've, I don't know, someone just dropped off this video today.  Yeah.  This is seriously what is going on on Big Brother 2. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And Justin, because of this incident, it has been booted from the Big Brother house, but  no one knows that yet, Anthony.  No.  They may tell everyone tomorrow night when they run Big Brother 2.  I'm looking at the Big Brother 2 chat room on bigbrother.com there.  Yeah.  And all of these lifeless tools don't have a clue.  They have no idea?  Maybe our listeners should go to there and, uh, and let them know.  Yeah.  This is a huge exclusive for the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:57:00]  No one knows this yet.  There you go.  So we want to play the audio clip, Anthony.  Yeah.  Do not answer any pagers or phones.  No.  All right.  Let's, uh, go to the clip right now.  Hold on.  Really?  Figures.  Hold on.  All right.  Here's the clip.  Would you get mad if I cracked you over the head with this?  Uh-oh.  You know, I'm a little dope.  Yeah.  I'm a first bit of brother.  I'm a little full of sex.  For real?  Yeah.  My mom would love me.  Oh, my. 
[00:57:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So they're making out right now?  You can hear it.  Yeah.  Hey, hang on.  I'm going to slash you.  Oh.  Would you get mad if I killed you?  No, but I wasn't there.  No, seriously.  Would you get mad if I killed you?  I would.  Okay.  Would you get mad?  No.  For real? 
[00:58:00]  Let me say how he has a real thing.  Huh?  Would you get mad?  Yeah.  Do it.  Do it?  Do it.  You down?  I won't get mad.  You like that, right, baby?  We want water?  Nice.  Jesus.  There it is.  Got to see the video, but, I mean, this is radio. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, but through that whole thing, he had the knife right on her neck.  You down with that?  You down with that?  Thigh.  What would you do if I killed you?  Thigh.  Thigh.  Thigh.  Thigh.  So that's huge news.  Justin has been kicked out of the house for that incident.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  And the interesting thing, CBS will be telling everyone that tomorrow.  Yeah, they don't want the cat out of the bag.  Until tomorrow.  Right. 
[00:59:00]  So you'd have to watch the show, but screw it.  We just told you.  Yeah.  And the official Big Brother chat room, they still have no clue?  Yeah.  That's funny.  I guess there's a message for it that says, it's Big Brother 2 sucks.  BB sucks.  Yeah.  And Justin gone.  Apparently, Justin threw a chair, smashed the chess set, and peed on the window.  Now he's gone.  According to Will, Justin's so absolutely nuts, he requested on his own to see a psychologist. 
[00:59:30]  Uh, Hardy was threatening to leave if Justin didn't go.  Here's a link describing what happened last night, and then there's some transcripts.  I don't know.  I have to go through these and check it out, but apparently this is the first time he's  acted like a kook.  Well, this was the final straw with the knife, though.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  All right.  Um, Anthony, we got some news on Angela from Bellevue.  Oh, good.  Uh, Angela's been acting a little kooky lately. 
[01:00:00]  She was on our show yesterday, and she was crying.  We didn't mean to make her cry, but she started crying, and then you're hearing there was an  incident last night at Bar 9?  Yeah, it seems she ran in.  I'm hearing something that she skipped out on a cab fare and then ran back out.  Maybe police were involved.  I don't know.  All right.  Rob's on the phone.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, so yesterday I heard her on the radio, and she sounded really out of character, which  you guys could tell.  Yeah.  So immediately I ran, and I called her boyfriend and went to see what was up with her, and he 
[01:00:30]  told me that he had just broke up with her.  Uh-oh.  So that's why...  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  If anyone saw the HBO Bellevue special, if you remember, that's the reason Angela was in  Bellevue to begin with.  Right.  Because a boyfriend broke up with her, and it sent her over the edge.  Yeah.  So that's why she's falling apart.  So somebody better get her belt and shoelaces away from her.  Well, we want to talk to her today, but we can't find her.  I have no idea.  I'm still trying to get her boyfriend, see if he knows anything, but I don't know, man. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  So you should watch out.  All right.  We're trying to get Angela on the phone, so if anyone knows where she is, please have  her call the show.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Take away all the sharp objects.  So now we're hearing a rumor that a boyfriend might have broke up with Angela.  Oh, hence the behavior yesterday on the show.  You want to meet our one-legged combatants?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Let's see what this is all about.  Cripple bouts begins today.  Mm-hmm.  Tomorrow we're going to have two blind guys fighting, and in the very near future we're 
[01:01:30]  going to have wheelchair jousting.  I can't wait for that.  Well, we kick it off today with one-legged guys beating the hell out of each other.  Best out of three falls.  First guy to fall down twice loses.  I'm going to knock him down.  Here, grab that mic, yo.  Yeah.  Over here.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's going on, man?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, bro.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up?  What's your name?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy's got one of those Nike fake legs.  Yeah, that's like the real modern ones. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  It's got the little, what's that, hydraulics in there and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Now, you're wearing shorts.  Yeah.  So everybody can see it.  Yeah.  Why do you put a sock on the shoe?  Just for cosmetic reasons.  Is it just because it looks better because you've got a sock on the other foot?  Well, I figure if people are going to stare at me, I might as well give them something to stare at.  Something to stare at me.  Okay.  Fake leg with a sock.  Cool.  All right.  And you're the one, how did you lose that?  Cancer. 
[01:02:30]  Ouch.  Oh, that's always funny.  There you go.  Cancer's always good for a laugh.  You too?  It's always a great way to bring the show down.  Yeah.  How long ago?  I was 15.  15?  Wow.  I'm 35 now.  So like 20 years ago, right?  Yeah.  Cool.  And that leg pops off so you could do some one-legged boxing?  You got it.  This guy looks like he's going to kick your ass.  Oh, please.  I'm kind of looking like that in the same way.  When they both walked in, I'm like, uh-oh.  I hope this isn't too one-sided here.  We became good friends.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, we did.  We have the both same, you know, the same thing, the same loss. 
[01:03:00]  I was 11.  Yeah?  From cancer?  Yeah.  Same exact disease.  Are you guys like Eddie from Big Brother?  No.  Well, the same thing happened with him.  We spent time in the bathroom before we came in.  Please, just don't tell me I look like him, because everybody says I look like him.  You look like him a little bit.  A bigger version.  A bigger version, right?  Really?  A muscle version.  People come up to you and go, hey, Eddie.  Hey, Eddie.  Hey, Eddie.  Well, it's the bad wood and the good wood.  So where are you guys from?  I'm from Randolph, New Jersey. 
[01:03:30]  Bayonne, New Jersey.  Bayonne.  Ah, Bayonne, like Justin.  Yeah.  Did you know Justin?  No, I've heard of him, though.  Yeah.  Have you heard of him?  All right.  He's kind of a tool.  I even had three people training me.  Really?  For today?  Yep.  I had...  You're not scared of him?  He's a lot bigger than you do.  No.  Oh, please.  I take the leg off and use it as like a boomerang, you know?  Oh, my God.  His is titanium.  Mine is oak.  Oh, really?  Mine is...  You've got an actual wooden leg, then. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, but here's what he would pack around his arm.  Right.  I have the titanium one, but I bought a house with my wife in November, and I still can't  find the damn thing, so...  Let me see the leg.  Wooden.  Holy...  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  It's painted.  I'm a drummer in a punk band, so I paint it every show I do, whatever, so it's a thing.  That is a big wooden leg, yeah.  Oh, yes, it is.  Too much information.  Thirty-six pounds.  Yep.  And you can move around pretty well on that, right?  I saw you walking around.  I didn't even notice you were missing the leg.  Well, I just came off a 48th floor doing construction, so I'm doing that, which is why I love you. 
[01:04:30]  Ah, the working class.  The tin knockers.  Ouch.  Do we have some good prizes for these guys?  Yeah, do we?  Oh, just get me a new leg.  A new leg.  A can of pledge or something.  We'll figure out some good prizes for you.  I'm still thinking, though, it's going to be a one-sided brawl.  No, it's not.  I hope you're good at defense, yeah?  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I just picture my wife. 
[01:05:00]  The only defense I've got is when my wife doesn't want me to go out, she hides it.  Right.  I've got to hop.  Yeah, I don't know.  I love you, G.  You know how this is going to work.  First guy to fall down, twice loses, right?  All right.  Okay.  You have no problem with this.  No.  What are we doing?  I've got two legs, and I wouldn't fight him with one leg.  I used to be a lifeguard with one leg, so what's the difference?  All right.  Swim in circles.  That old gag.  That old gag.  Anthony, we've got to go to the phone real fast. 
[01:05:30]  The winner of the Moms I'd Like to F contest has finally called in.  Can you ask her if she'd let me stump her?  Yeah.  Neo.  Neo.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  You're going to Myrtle Beach.  I know.  I'm so excited.  I just found out.  Hold on a second.  I can't hear you from this phone.  All right.  There's Neo.  Hi, Neo.  Hi.  Now I can hear you.  Yeah.  You won the contest.  There are many, many guys all over the United States that want to F you bad.  Yeah.  Wow.  Thanks.  Most effable mom.  How does that make you feel? 
[01:06:00]  Good.  Thanks.  Makes me feel real good.  It's kind of dirty, but hey.  It's a little dirty, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people, though, saying you didn't show enough.  I know.  It was funny because I was reading.  I was like, you know, of course I wanted to win.  So I would check every once in a while.  And someone, it was the funniest comment.  This guy said I was wearing more clothes than an Amish woman on a hot day.  Yeah.  I was like, thanks.  Well, would you like to come in and do another photo shoot with less clothes? 
[01:06:30]  I don't know.  I'll think about it.  You know, maybe I'll send you some pictures in my bathing suit.  Pictures in your bathing suit?  From Myrtle Beach.  From Myrtle Beach?  Yeah.  All right.  Do that.  Actually, no.  It's required that you come in.  Yeah.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  It was the contest rules in that small print.  Yeah.  Very small print, but it's definitely.  Oh, that's right.  I saw that.  Yeah, so you're going to have to come in and pose in a bathing suit that you will be taking  to Myrtle Beach.  I'll think about it.  All right.  I'll think about it.  I don't know, though.  I'm kind of shy like that.  Really? 
[01:07:00]  Well, Neo, congratulations.  I said, Opie?  Yeah.  I'm a little upset with you.  Oh, what did I say?  You were voting for someone else because I wasn't blonde?  Yeah, Jeannie.  Hey, I used to be blonde.  Oh, you did?  Fake blonde, though, right?  No, until I got older.  And then, actually, I dyed it dark and then light again.  You got a blonde peach?  Nah, so I'm not that blonde.  Blonde peach.  I just have a soft spot for blondes from time to time.  I'll dye my hair blonde for you.  All right.  You're married.  This guy knocked you off. 
[01:07:30]  He's got the long-term contract.  All right, Neo.  All right, thank you.  Have fun in Myrtle Beach, okay?  All right, thanks.  There she goes.  The winner of the Moms I'd Like to Have Contact.  Yeah.  Neo.  Beating out Jeannie and Jennifer, right?  Yep.  All right.  Tom has a question about the one-legged fight here.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, I was just wondering, hey, you guys going to do the weigh-in with or without the legs?  Well, I guess without.  How much do you guys weigh without the legs? 
[01:08:00]  I wouldn't even know.  I always get weighed with the leg.  Yeah.  Oh, so it's with the leg.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to fight without the legs.  Right.  You don't care.  Yeah.  What's it to you anyway?  Oh, God damn.  All right, guys.  I was there, guys.  All right.  Thanks, bro.  Hey, bro.  Hey, you guys suck.  All right, Tom.  All right.

It is two guys, only two legs between them. 
[01:11:00]  That's right.  Yeah, Woody and Jim, one leg each.  The one-legged fight.  Is that a nickname, Woody, because he's got a wooden leg?  Probably.  And then, do they call him Woody?  A lot of people call him because they know his band.  He's in a punk rock band.  Yeah.  Everyone's saying, you've got to have this guy.  Wait, Mike will explain.  Mike, Mike.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  It's Mike Logley.  What's up?  You know Woody?  I know Woody big time.  We used to play on the road together all the time.  This guy is insane. 
[01:11:30]  We went up to Brown University, and he was doing flagpoles.  He was hitting mailboxes and scaring all the smart kids.  Well, what does he do with the flagpole?  Well, basically, he finds a pole, and he hangs off the side of it like a guy in the circus.  It's insane.  Oh, he can do that thing where you're hanging at a 90-degree angle?  It's an exact 90-degree angle.  Wow.  It's hysterical.  That's some upper body strength right there.  Yeah, that takes a lot of strength.  Jim is crazy to fight Woody. 
[01:12:00]  I know.  Jim's going to get his ass kicked.  Woody outweighs Jim by, I don't know, 20, 30 pounds.  Woody's in shape.  Woody's a construction worker, big guy.  Right.  Jim looks like he just kind of hangs out and drinks.  Nothing wrong with that, but he's going to be fighting in a couple minutes here.  He looks more like a guy you would see maybe doing computer programming.  Yeah, there you have it.  Something like that.  There you have it.  And Woody looks like the construction worker guy.  What's the name of Woody's band, Mike?  Day 19.  What is it?  Day 19.  Day?  Day 19. 
[01:12:30]  Day 19, okay.  They're huge.  All right, we'll take a look out for them, all right?  You got it.  Thanks, Mike.  Big fan, guys.  We appreciate that.  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got some ideas for that blind wrestling tomorrow.  Or boxing.  How about...  Yeah, blind boxing is tomorrow, yeah.  Yeah, how about pouring laundry detergent all over the floor?  And then instead of having rope servering, how about having a bunch of guys in Nerf bats  just beating them to keep them in one center? 
[01:13:00]  Nah.  You know...  Nerf guns shooting them in the head, you know?  We don't have to dress up blind boxing tomorrow.  No.  It is what it is.  It's just going to be unbelievable.  We're going to put...  Yeah, but if you're going to go blind boxing, you might as well go the whole nine yards.  Well, we're going to put, like, bells on them and stuff.  It's going to be...  No trap doors.  It's going to be very entertaining.  No trap doors?  No.  No.  Oh, come on, guys.  Believe me, Tom.  You're going to love it.  Rick, is this picture up yet?  Not yet.  We're already taking pictures of the one-legged guys in their boxing gear, getting ready for  the fight.  All the pictures will be up on WNEW.com in the very near future. 
[01:13:30]  Keith checking and saying, I'm a new listener, and that guy, Earl, looks just like Shrek.  No way.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah, because we've been saying that for quite a while.  If any new listeners out there, if you look at Earl's picture, either on foundrymusic.com  or I think he's on WNEW.com, he looks like Shrek, yes.  The black Earl is black.  Fred, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You should give that little handicap, handicapped fella a handicap by giving him a snowshoe or 
[01:14:00]  a swimming flipper so you can't knock him over.  Furthermore...  The guy has no fear, though.  No.  He's like, no, I'll take him on.  I don't care.  He's very confident.  Yeah.  What about, like, the buzzsaw coming up in the ring?  You're going to put bear traps in the ring or something like that so they can get caught  up?  Maybe we'll have some obstacles for the wheelchair jousting.  Yeah, a tripping wire or something.  You know, we might have to put one obstacle in the ring tomorrow for blind boxing.  Yeah, maybe an obstacle.  Just one.  Some kind of spinning thing.  Something.  All right, guys. 
[01:14:30]  All right, Fred.  You know, I think the one-legged fighting is going to be great, but I just cannot wait  for tomorrow's blind boxing.  I mean...  Yeah.  I know.  Call all your friends and tell them blind boxing on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  That's how you can help the show.  Especially in the new cities.  Game on.  Game on.  We're ready with Woody and Jim?  Yeah, we're ready.  Okay.  Ready to rock.  They're both in their gear.  Woody is stretching out.  He's stretching, you know.  Woody is getting his ass. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, boy.  And Jim is looking at him stretch going, oh, man, don't do that.  Oh, no.  We're going to go for the first guy that falls down twice loses.  I don't know.  Is it a knockdown rule?  They might have good balance.  It may take a...  We'll just...  Dude, this is going to have nothing to do with balance at this point.  I just believe this is going to be Woody hitting him at the...  The balance was pretty good.  They're both, like, bouncing around, like, you know, fixing themselves up and everything.  It's pretty funny. 
[01:15:30]  What's the other guy's name?  Jim.  Yeah.  What are they laughing at?  What's up, stinky?  Stinky, what's up?  He's using his leg as his junk, and he's, like, J-O-ing it.  It'll look so funny.  Wait, get him in here.  Get him in here.  Get him in here.  Woody.  Woody.  Fun with your stump.  Fun with your stump.  Sure.  Woody gets...  Woody gets...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What is that of his mind? 
[01:16:00]  He takes his stump...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, he uses it like a schlong.  It looks like the real thing.  He sticks it straight out and starts pumping on it.  Yeah, we find the most fun listeners ever.  Hey, Stink, what does that look like when you look over and you just see the one leg sitting  there with the jeans on?  With the what?  What?  Woody took off his leg, but he took off his jeans, too, so he's in his shorts.  Yeah.  And it's just the jeans with a leg sitting on the couch. 
[01:16:30]  With a leg in it.  Did you get a picture of that?  Get a picture of all that fun stuff.  And, um, yes, these two are going to enter our ring, one leg each, in a battle that will  kick off cripple bouts here on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:17:00]  Taste the chicken with a leg rock.  You've got to taste it with a leg rock.  You're going to eat dutcher and crap lately.  Oh, my God, he's got one leg rock.  Take out the good leg.  This, I can't wait to see this now.  All right.  We've got to get to the other mics.  Yes, let's, uh, get to the ringside broadcast booth here on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:17:30]  Where the people are waiting, uh, where the people are waiting, uh, in the ring.  A little crowd developing around the, uh, ring.  You guys got it?  Yeah, I got it.  Come on, it.  All right, we are outside the studio.  This is our first cripple bout.  There will be many in the, in the coming weeks.  Oh, my God.  Uh, what, Rick?  Watch this trick that, uh, what he's going to do.  What he does.  I ain't got a picture of it already, but. 
[01:18:00]  What a party gang.  He puts his fake leg over his, uh, the back of his neck like he's stretching out his leg.  We have mouthpieces.  We have, um, do you have a mouthpiece?  We don't have mouthpieces?  Eh, don't worry about your teeth.  Yeah, that's the least of your problems right now.  Now, have you, um, well, what, what, buddy, when was the last time you were in a fight?  Uh, three weeks ago. 
[01:18:30]  Three weeks ago?  My wife is Irish in the town.  I mean, maybe out, uh, at, uh.  A year ago in Hoboken, New Jersey.  A year ago, and some guy, uh.  No, about eight guys with me and my friend George.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And how did it work out?  Uh, we were incarcerated.  You were?  Oh, that's so.  Did you do some damage?  Yes, we did.  Uh, wood hurts a lot.  Really?  Yes, it does.  You go right for the, the leg as a weapon?  Kneecap to the skull, yes.  Wow.  Holy ass.  And, um, what, what was the last fight you were in?  We're eating still.  Can we get a mic over there?  Uh, hey Jim, what was the last fight you were in? 
[01:19:00]  Uh, probably last week with my wife.  Well, besides the wife fight, when was the last, when was the last time you were in a  fight?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Uh, it's been a while.  Yeah, it's been a long time.  And what, did we find out what you do for a living yet?  I used to be a roofer, now I'm a homemaker.  You're a homemaker.  I swear to God.  I am a homemaker.  Don't start.  I'm just saying.  You'll be missing a leg before I do. 
[01:19:30]  You check out Martha Stewart every day?  You've got to catch me.  Um, well, either that or Sandy Kane.  There you are.  All right.  Uh, this is how it's going to work.  I guess we're going to get you into the squared circle.  And, uh, first guy that falls down twice loses.  What if they're pushed outside the squared circle?  I, I, I don't know.  Do you have your bell?  I think it's got to be in, uh, yeah, let me grab my bell to start the round.  All right, we're just about ready.  Woody's in one corner, Jim's in the other.  Everything all.  I got, I got a, uh, corner crew here, though. 
[01:20:00]  You do?  Yeah.  Same thing.  What do you got, man?  What do you got?  You got nothing.  You got nothing.  It's really boxing, right?  Huh?  It's really boxing.  Is it really boxing?  Um, yeah, I wouldn't kick or anything like that.  Well, what the hell are we going to kick with, man?  You could do.  If we're just one, we're down, dude.  An ass-kicking contest.  Kung fu?  Yeah, you could try things.  I guess, sure, anything goes when you can't kick.  Well, I want to, like, do the Matrix.  I want to do, like, the Matrix.  The Matrix.  I would concentrate on staying away from Woody. 
[01:20:30]  That's what I would concentrate on.  I heard what you guys were saying about me.  Yeah.  I heard what you guys were saying about me, so I don't want to hear nothing.  No, Jim, we're amazed you're not scared of this guy.  Did you hear what he just did to the guy in Hoboken a while back?  What did you do to the guy in Hoboken?  Don't say it again.  I'm in court for that one.  Oh, okay.  Well, there was an altercation, and, uh...  And Jim brought his friends, right?  No, those...  Those guys are here to see you.  I just met him a little while ago.  Who are they? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, all right.  They have the videotape.  All right, I think we're ready, Anthony.  All right, gentlemen, if you would take a corner.  It's crippled bouts on the Opie and Anthony show.  If you take a corner, there we go.  They're hopping to their corners.  Wait, this could get ugly, man.  I don't think we thought this out completely.  All right.  All right, on Anthony's bell, okay?  All right.  Back to your corners.  Back to your corner.  You know all the rules, just blah, blah, blah.  We don't even know those. 
[01:21:30]  Ready?  Okay, let's get ready to rumble!  All right, here's the first round.  Starts the first round.  They're hopping, hopping around.  Sizing each other up.  Each of them on one leg.  Wow.  All right.  Not much going on yet.  I'm taking a...  Oh!  Oh, okay.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  We've got to describe what happened.  That was a fantastic shot.  All right, they sized each other up.  Sized each other up.  There was a couple little jabs going on.  Actually, I believe Tom... 
[01:22:00]  Jim, Jim.  Jim, I'm sorry.  Jim hit Woody first.  Right.  Jim came out very aggressive, punched at Woody.  Yeah.  Then they bounced a little more, and then Woody went in with a right hand, I believe, and just  floored.  Just floored up.  He just floored.  Oh, he knocked me to the ground.  Big deal.  Yeah, Jim fell down.  There's a first time for everything.  Yes.  Okay.  How's your head?  Huh?  How's your head feeling?  I'm over here now.  Did you lose balance because you were hit, or did you actually... 
[01:22:30]  No, because he hit me so hard.  Yeah.  I like this guy.  He's all right, man.  And now, Woody, if we could get the mic over there.  Describe what just happened.  Huh?  You punched him, and he...  He does that thing where he uses it as his junk, and it really is funny.  It's just instinct.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I apologize to him.  You got a good shot in there.  No, I'm just being a snapper. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  Did you get a good video of that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to keep fighting.  If Jim falls down one more time, this bout is over.  It's over.  So, you're going to have to be aggressive, I think.  Okay.  Three falls.  Well, that's...  Yeah.  All right.  Should we...  Don't make me go Matrix.  We might have to turn this into three out of five.  You want to make it three falls?  Yeah, because that went way too quickly.  First one to fall three times.  First one to fall three times.  Because that took ten seconds.  All right.  All right.  They're back in their corners.  What are you trying to say?  Woody and Jim.  First one to fall three times. 
[01:23:30]  Here we go.  There's the bell.  Round two.  Round two.  Starting up.  Hopping.  All right.  Nothing's going on.  Oh, my God.  Jim tries to get in there with these two-handed jab things he's doing.  Just kind of hopping around.  Woody really sizing him up, trying to get that good shot.  Woody's like Mike Tyson.  He's just waiting for that one blow, man.  Whoa!  Oh, God!  All right!  He knocks him into the chair with a roundhouse.  Yeah.  Right.  Jim is out again.  Woody's got incredible balance. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  He just sizes up.  Yeah.  Looking for that little room.  Woody getting some water.  Dickhead.  To get the foot.  All right.  I think at this point, now Jim has to knock Woody down three times in a row.  Right.  Before Woody knocks you down one more time.  Woody, you guys can sit down.  In other words, can I put my hands down and just take his leg out?  No.  No.  No.  Here, talk to Woody, man. 
[01:24:30]  Woody, your strategy is great.  You sit there, you pick your shot, and then you go in with the right hand.  That one was a roundhouse right.  Yeah.  You took him out with that.  Very nice.  Allegedly.  He's got a good fighting style.  He really does.  I saw it.  All right.  You know what?  There's no one going to beat this guy.  I know.  Yes, they will.  This guy's good.  Some 350-pound dude's going to come up there.  Wait, wait, wait.  They're going to jump out of that.  Are we ready for the third round? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  This is the third round.  If Woody knocks down Jim again, it's all over, and Woody is the one-legged boxing champion.  All right.  Live once.  Here we go.  On the bell.  Let's get into the corners, and there it is.  Okay.  Back out there, touching gloves, center ring, and here they go.  Again, keeping their balance, hopping up and down, and I don't know, Jim, Jim a little  more laid back this time.  He was very aggressive the first couple of rounds, getting right in there.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, Jim throws a right hand. 
[01:25:30]  It missed everything.  Woody.  Oh, man.  No.  Oh, my God.  Woody has put down Jim again with two consecutive right hands to the head.  Oh, okay.  There it is.  Woody is fixed.  It is over.  The first right hand, Jim recovered from.  He spun around.  He kept his balance, but then he didn't know that Woody was right behind him, followed up  with a second right hand. 
[01:26:00]  Putting Jim on the mat.  That was it.  It made me feel like a gyroscope.  Yeah, you spun around on that one.  What a great job.  Both of you.  Unbelievable.  Woody.  I got to see the video of this.  Jim, you all right?  Steve C videotaped everything.  I'm fine.  Okay, Woody.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you so much.  Would you like to take on another newcomer?  If you give me five minutes, yeah, I'll do it.  Well, I don't know if we can find another one-legged guy today.  All right, well, until next week, you know.  All right.  Whatever.  You'll be available, though?  Yeah, I'll be available.  All right.  You're the one-legged boxing champion. 
[01:26:30]  It's Woody from Jersey, Anthony.  Woody!  Steve C videotaped the whole thing for the website.  You're going to be able to see it.  Because he works for a construction company.  Do I have the rights to sue him?  No, man.  You'll disappear.  That's right.  Good job, guys.  All right, you guys, let's hear it for Jim and Woody.  Kicking off cripple bouts on the Opie and Anthony show.  Tomorrow's the big day.  We've got blind boxing.  Tell all your friends.  Rick's got some great still shots of the bout. 
[01:27:00]  They're going to go up on WNEW.com within the next 15 or 20 minutes.  Okay?  Rick, did you get some of those shots, the action shots right at the point of contact,  things like that?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, that's a good.  Wow, what a great follow-through shot that is.  That was knockdown number two.  That was knockdown number two?  Do you have any of the other ones?  Do you have knockdown number three?  No, I missed that one.  Let me see.  I'm watching the videotape real quick.  Is this the third round, Steve?  That's the third.  Okay.  Yeah, the balance thing. 
[01:27:30]  Very important.  Here he goes.  Oh!  I can't wait until you see this.  It's so good.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Jim goes.  He gets hit in the head.  And then he turns around and goes to straighten his headgear out.  And that's when Woody comes in with the second shot and just plow him on the floor.  Wow.  All right.  Here we go.  I'm checking it out.  Very short rounds, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Woody knew what he was doing in there.  He really did.  He had a good defense.  Oh, my God. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, God.  Wait till you guys see that video clip.  Woody really had a professional stance and a good defense.  I mean, Jim was coming in with these.  He would hit with both hands.  You know, almost.  I hate to say it, but almost like when a chick is trying to beat you up.  Like, they're groaning out there.  But they come at you with the two hands.  Yeah.  And that's what he was doing.  Yeah.  And Woody was able to fend that off.  What a way to start crippled bouts. 
[01:28:30]  One-legged boxing.  That's great.  Get those pictures of Scott immediately.  Yeah.  Get that right up on the website so you can check out what we just saw.  Wait till you see the video clip on foundrymusic.com.  That will be later tonight.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Crippled Bouts continues tomorrow with blind boxing.  Yes.  Call your friends and tell them that's what's going on on the Opie and Anthony show tomorrow.  And then we have a couple of people in wheelchairs.  We're going to get that wheelchair jousting thing going, which I can't wait for.  All right.  Quick break.  We'll be back.

[01:30:30]  Sending that out to Woody.  The champion.  Nice shot, man.  Nice shot.  Taking out Jim.  Three rounds in a row.  Our one-legged boxing champion.  Yep.  Woody's willing to take on someone else.  If you've got one leg and you want to box, Woody is the champion.  Yeah.  877-692-1027.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  In Cleveland, I swear to God, you heard every punch. 
[01:31:00]  Every punch of the bout?  Every punch.  It was great.  I thought it was going to suck because I'm using my imagination.  Yeah.  No, we got to thank Stinky.  He had the field mic and he was getting right into the action.  I'm looking at some of the pictures, which are now up on WNEW.com.  And I'm just trolling through them right now.  They've got about 11 pictures up.  They might be downloading those later.  Oh, that's a good shot.  Yeah, Rick got some great shots of the bout because a lot of people are like,  oh, you know, this is radio, idiots. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, that's why we take the pictures, put them up on the website,  and then you could, you know, fill in the blanks at home.  Hey, man, from Cleveland.  Been laughing my ass off for the whole two weeks I've been listening.  Ah, thank you, guys.  Cleveland is starving for the show, man.  Hey, thanks, Rick.  We appreciate it.  A lot of early support in Cleveland.  It's amazing.  Yep.  It really is amazing.  Thank you.  The pictures look good, Ant.  Yeah.  Cool.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  As this is going on, I'm getting this incredible visual of Tina Turner in Thunderdome 
[01:32:00]  saying, two legs enter, one leg leaves.  All right, guys.  Great job.  Thank you.  Referring to a Mad Max.  Yes.  Tom.  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I know Woody from Bayon.  I work out with him sometimes in the gym.  Yeah.  Let me just tell you, I got two legs.  I don't think I would want to box the guy.  There's no way I would box the guy.  Hell no.  No, I'm serious.  He's insane.  Yeah, I'm serious.  The intensity in his eyes when he just works out just, like, freaks me out.  It's funny you should say that because when he was sizing up Jim, he was just kind of, 
[01:32:30]  you know, he had this look in his eye.  Very focused.  And he was just waiting for his opportunity to, you know, to pop his head off.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's insane.  One time, one of my friends was telling me they went to a Metallica concert.  Uh-huh.  He's waiting on line to the bathroom, and the line was, like, tremendously long, so he  takes off his leg and just starts hitting the beverage can with it just so people  will move out of his way.  Oh, he remembers that, all right?  That's great.  Well, your friend Woody's a star today.  His pictures are up on WNEW.com. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, he's insane, dude.  And video clips of the fight later on on FoundryMusic.com.  All right, cool.  When I see him in the gym, I have to ask him about that.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Where are those guys?  Great job.  We should have them in here again.  Get Woody and Jim in.  Now that they've recovered.  Jordan.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  You tell me.  You call the show.  Yeah.  I can bring in those girls for Friday for the, for the, for the, for the most, what do 
[01:33:30]  you call it?  Holy ass.  Jordan.  Pick a neck basket.  Oh, I'm alive?  Yeah, you're alive.  I'm driving, too.  Hold on, guys.  I'll pull over.  You guys deserve full attention.  You're on in seven cities right now, and you're just stammering your way through.  I'm sorry.  I'm screwing up.  I'm screwing up for the car wash.  Oh, the teen car wash.  Oh, okay.  Finally.  Huh?  Yeah.  To promote the car wash, I can bring in some of those girls I was talking about yesterday,  and you guys can shoot them with water guns.  You swear, you swear that you could get us like 30 teenage girls for the teen car wash.  Yeah, for the car wash. 
[01:34:00]  Right now, I mean, I'm building my army here.  All right.  And then you want to bring in 10 of the girls for Friday?  Yeah, Friday's fine.  Why do I smell like a bit or something?  Yeah, like you're up to something, Jordan.  I'm up to nothing.  You just want to bring these 10 girls by?  Yep.  I want them to wash your office.  You just happen to know 10 hot teenage girls?  Yeah.  How old are they?  I got out of high school.  How old are they?  18.  They're all 18?  Uh-huh.  10 18-year-old girls.  All right.  It's worth a shot. 
[01:34:30]  You come down Friday.  We're still looking for a place to hold the teen car wash.  We want to do that sooner than later.  Okay.  Jordan, we'll see you Friday.  All right.  Who should I talk to?  Hold on.  Let's go to Louis.  Louis!  Dude, you guys deserve a huge ass kissing.  That was the funniest effing thing I have ever heard.  There's just nothing funnier than a guy with one leg named Woody.  Yeah.  One leg.  Yeah, I got a great idea for that blind boxing thing.  You put them both in separate rings with mannequins standing in front of them and let them figure 
[01:35:00]  it out.  Stay cool, dude.  Hey, we haven't heard from Blind Dave today.  Louis, you were finally funny.  Congratulations.  Oh, Dave.  Well, we have Woody and Jim back in the studio.  Yeah.  Great job, guys.  I give Jim a lot of credit, man.  Seriously.  Hell yeah.  Seriously.  You were overmatched, but you hung in there. 
[01:35:30]  I never knew that there were two Opie's and two Anthony's right now.  Why?  Oh, okay.  You got me.  That was pretty good, man.  That was so much fun, man.  That's a ballsy move, getting in there and doing that.  The first time that he knocked you down, that was a scary punch.  Yeah.  Did you?  He hit me hard.  He hit me hard.  You heard it on the radio, too.  It was like, poof.  I saw it.  Carl, what's up?  Yo, let me just tell you, Jim.  First off, I never heard anybody get their ass kicked before, but you definitely fell 
[01:36:00]  for it.  Oh, and hey, fantastic out here outside of Philly in New Jersey.  All right on, Carl.  Fantastic.  Got to get a bunch more wow stickers.  Yeah, cool.  That's it.  Cleveland rocks.  Let me tell you.  I'll have a good time.  Yeah, we like Cleveland so far.  Get to Cleveland, let me tell you.  All right.  Thanks, Carl.  All right, buddy.  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Charlie.  Yeah, Opie.  Hey, Anthony, everybody.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, let me commend you guys on that road show.  It was awesome.  Yeah.  3,800 people.  I was there with that chick, Summer.  Summer was hot. 
[01:36:30]  What an awesome time.  Yeah.  Also, I was wondering if you'd take this guy Woody on at 60-foot depths, under the water.  Underwater, Opie.  Would you find him?  60 feet underwater?  Underwater, I'd find him.  The place where you prefer fighting.  You know, because of the leg.  You know what?  The water's lubricated, so you're getting it right in the air.  Uh-oh.  I wouldn't mess with this guy, seriously.  Hell, no.  Who cares?  He only has one leg.  Guy can fight.  Oh, our buddy Frank Caliendo checking in.  Hey.  Hey.  Frank.  Hey.  Frank.  Hey, what's up? 
[01:37:00]  What's up, buddy?  How are you?  Pretty good.  We just watched two guys fight.  They both have one leg.  You watched that?  You watched it, huh?  Yeah, we got a new bit on our show called Cripple Bouts.  And today we had two guys with one leg boxing.  Yeah.  And this one guy, Woody, who's built and he works out, just kicked Jim's ass.  No, he doesn't work out.  He works construction.  There's a difference.  Yeah.  Now, this is two guys with one leg each?  Yes.  Yeah.  They're hopping around and boxing.  This is a job for John Madden. 
[01:37:30]  See, normally guys have two legs, and when you don't have two legs, you can either have  no legs or three legs or one leg.  If you've got one leg, you're probably going to get up on the Opie and Anthony show, and  that's right.  If you get your ass kicked, then they talk about it.  If you don't get your ass kicked, they talk about it.  Either way, they're going to talk about it, but the thing it comes down to is you still  only have one leg.  Thanks, man.  We appreciate it.  The thing about having one leg is it's tough to be a punter or a kicker because you've 
[01:38:00]  got nothing to brace yourself on.  If you did have something to brace yourself on, that would be like a Steve Austin special  error.  A kickstand.  I think that's what the bionic man's name is.  I can't remember.  I remember Lindsey Wagner, but that's about him.  Speaking of Lindsey Wagner, I'm just babbling.  I'm trying to introduce the people.  I just heard recently that you guys were syndicating. 
[01:38:30]  I didn't even know that.  We're on in seven cities, Frank.  Right now.  And you know what's really funny is that I'm going to most of the cities that you guys  have joined.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  Yeah.  So I thought it would be a time to call and, you know, hey, here's a guy who knows how to  promote himself.  Where are you going to be this weekend?  This weekend I'm in San Francisco.  Oh, really?  And I'd heard that you guys might be actually heading out here soon.  Yeah.  Tomorrow would have been the day to call. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah, that probably would have been the day.  Now, let me ask you something.  Let me explain something to you.  I emailed saying, hey, it would be great to call tomorrow, wouldn't it?  And Rick calls me.  He's like, why don't you call today?  It's a typical Rick move, isn't it?  Absolutely.  We'll get you now.  Have them plug a date in San Francisco that no one will hear because they're not on San  Francisco until tomorrow.  Well, obviously, I'm calling tomorrow again and doing the same crap. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  That's okay.  It's when you do the same thing sometimes.  I've been doing the same crap for a while now.  Hey, is Adam Sandler there?  Did he get to check out the one-legged boxing?  Hold on one second.  Let me get him.  Okay.  He's drinking in the back.  Hold on.  Yeah, Frank and Adam, close friends.  Hey, how are you?  Opie and Anthony, I love you guys.  O and A.  What's going on?  Hey, by the way, Frank Caliendo will be at the Cleveland ImprovSuit.  Anyway, I just wanted to say, here's a guy who really does know how to get away with 
[01:40:00]  this man.  And Opie and Anthony are catching on.  Some of the radio, some of the smarter radio listeners are understanding.  Some of the dumber ones I like.  Why did he say that?  One-legged boxing.  I love that, man.  There is some very funny stuff that can happen from that.  Sometimes they lose their balance and other times they just look stupid.  But either way, I want to get these guys in a movie.  But we can't trip over our own feet. 
[01:40:30]  Is that a one-legged guy?  Yeah, that's a one-legged guy.  Hey, what's happening?  Howard, you can't trip over your own feet.  And I just tripped over my own tongue.  So that is not very good.  It was pretty cool, though, watching them brawl.  Yeah, it really was.  The bouncing thing is great.  You've got to keep your balance, you know?  So they hop on the one foot.  It's an Australian thing.  And then they throw the punches.  Well, let me tell you something, though.  There was different styles here.  Woody would bounce but stay in the same place.  He was just like up and down, up and down, sizing up Jim. 
[01:41:00]  That's what I like is bouncing up and down one place.  That's the way I like it.  Jim would hop, but it would be erratic.  He would hop and all of a sudden he would be like three feet to his right.  He would hop back to the left.  Because Woody was punching him.  Right.  You've got to keep your eyes on him.  That's literally crazy.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Frank, we have a guy that listens to our show, Syndication Underground, on the computer from San Francisco.  And he wants to know where you're going to be playing.  At the punchline.  In San Fran?  I am at the punchline in San Fran with everybody else. 
[01:41:30]  There's a plug for one guy.  West Coast Dave.  How awesome is that?  Hey, hold on a second.  Al has something to say about the...  Al Pacino?  He's got a couple questions.  I didn't know you were hanging with Al Pacino.  Yeah, hold on a second.  All right.  Get him for me, would you, Adam?  No problem.  I would do anything for you, Frank.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I heard...  Let me ask you something.  I heard you guys are doing bits with guys kicking each other's asses, and they've only got one frickin' leg. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Tell me about it.  Hey, does one of the guys hop around a lot?  Uh, yes.  Yeah, yeah, they both...  I love that guy.  I saw him on, uh...  Ripley's, believe it or not, hilarious.  But at the time, he was wearing one of those hats that Spanky McFarlane used to wear.  Yeah, right.  Little spinner.  Take off on that.  He'd spin it real fast.  Go up like a helicopter.  Can you believe I'm making this crap up off the top of my head?  Hey, uh...  He's been drinking with me, and Aldous is a very small man and cannot drink a lot of liquor. 
[01:42:30]  Neither can one-legged people either, though.  Yeah, does that take into consideration a week?  Kickstand when I'm out.  Yeah.  Flip out the kickstand.  That's going to be a tripod.  Cool.  All right, Dave.  Whatever works.  Hey, Frank, call us tomorrow.  Oh, you know I will.  All right, cool.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you, Frank.  And thank you very much.  I appreciate you listening to me.  I'm a very...  Hey, you're...  All right, man.  Here he goes, Frank Caliendo. 
[01:43:00]  It's so funny.  He does such great impressions.  But sometimes he just doesn't have anything to say with him.  Doug from King's Park, here's a guy I'm getting tired of real quick.  Anthony, we've been talking about Big Brother 2 and how this guy Justin...  Is Daddy going to be in it?  Huh?  He's not going to kick his ass, too.  I believe you would. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Justin got kicked out of the Big Brother house.  No one knows it yet.  Yeah.  Because he had a knife to this girl, Krista's throat.  Right.  Basically saying, what would you do if, you know, I killed you?  Yeah, he goes, what would you do if I killed you?  Well, you should be dead.  Right.  But she said, I wouldn't care.  Go for it.  I don't care.  It's a pretty intense video clip.  Yeah.  That we just happened to get today.  And we're kind of sharing it to everyone all over America today.  Yep.  Breaking the news.  Breaking the news. 
[01:44:00]  And I'm sure CBS is very happy with us today.  Well, there's a clip, not a clip, just a still shot of that on opianthony.com.  Yeah.  opianthony.com is a clip.  Yeah, it's under...  Still, I should say.  It's under Big Brother Knife Shot.  There you go.  Check it out.  Let's go to Steve.  She doesn't look that upset, but that guy's just a nut.  Steve, what's going on?  Is he walking around in a towel?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve.  Yo. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I'm on a mobile.  I'm driving up 95 North in Philly.  I put a wow on the back of my window because it's so damn dirty.  And I just got wowed.  There you have it.  Yeah.  See?  Congratulations, Steve.  It works great, man.  You guys are the greatest.  I'll tell you what, man.  And when I first heard you guys, it was like the first day, second day you came on in Philly.  And I was like, what the heck is going on here?  I mean, you guys are hilarious.  Oh.  And I'm thinking, I thought it was like some of the crew from 94 YSP. 
[01:45:00]  And it turned out, you know, next week I figured out you guys were there.  Hey, you guys are great.  All right.  You guys are great.  All right.  Thank you.  The wow thing.  The wow thing.  Hey, thanks a lot, man.  I wish you were here sooner.  Thank you, Steve.  We appreciate it.  You are the men.  All right.  There you go, Steve.  You got wow today, Anthony.  That's why we don't take a lot of wow calls.  Right.  Because they usually sound just like the one you just heard.  Really fast.  You just put a wow on the back of your car.  And if you're lucky, a lady will flash you on the highway.  Yeah.  Enjoy it.  Just write out wow on your car in any way you want. 
[01:45:30]  Emma.  Yes.  She's the one-legged girl from yesterday.  I am the one-legged girl from yesterday.  I wanted to thank you all for having me on the show.  And I missed the entire battle between the two one-legged guys.  Hey, Emma.  It was great.  I hope it sounded like something on the radio, because it was great to check out.  I was at work.  I just turned it on, and I heard you say that you had a battle between two one-legged guys.  I'm really pissed.  I missed it.  It sounded like it was right up my alley.  Yeah.  We definitely want to get you boxing some girl with one leg.  Sure.  I'll kick some butt.  Would you do that? 
[01:46:00]  Really?  Yeah.  I would.  I definitely would.  If you got it.  Emma, let's put it this way.  You don't want to box Woody.  No, no.  I don't think so.  Two one-legged chicks boxing would be the ultimate.  Yeah.  All right, Emma.  She's got to be good looking, though.  You know.  Yeah.  How about two one-legged chicks on the lesbian couch?  Oh.  Some sense.  A possibility.  I don't know.  All right.  I won't rule anything out.  Well, we're hoping we can find another one-legged girl to take you out in the boxing ring.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  Thanks, Emma.  No problem.  Okay.  Let's go to Glenn.  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  The only thing better than one-legged boxing is pick one-legged boxing.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  We're going to try to make that happen.  That'd be awesome.  I just want to say I'm from Philly, and I've been listening to Stern since I was a little  kid.  And you guys coming here is awesome.  Everybody says nothing like Stern.  I mean, everybody says you guys are...  Glenn, Glenn.  You can't use that S-word. 
[01:47:00]  Sorry.  Glenn, Glenn.  Yeah.  Screw all that crap.  Why'd you call?  It says on the phone you want to talk about blind boxing.  Yeah, I do.  I heard that yesterday, and I think that is the greatest radio skit.  All right.  Thank you, Glenn.  We're over here now.  Punch out, Maverick.  Punch out.  This would be a good time to take a little break.  Right.  We have a clip of Gay Marco eating the peach for the NSYNC tickets for the New Cities.  Oh. 
[01:47:30]  Gay Marco is a huge NSYNC fan.  I mean, Hugh, he couldn't be gayer.  He really couldn't be gayer.  He was on the show yesterday.  Yeah.  And we had NSYNC tickets that I don't know how the hell we got, but we got them.  He wanted to go really bad.  So we figured, what's the most heinous thing we can make Marco do for these tickets?  Well, what do heterosexual guys enjoy doing to ladies?  Nothing.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  No. 
[01:48:00]  I got mine.  You got yours.  No, it's just a joke.  Some of the favors.  Some of the oral favors.  Sure.  They like the oral.  So we had him do that particular act to a very attractive girl that we had in here.  Mm-hmm.  And he had to do it for the length of an NSYNC song to win the tickets.  Never done it before.  He's barely ever seen a naked woman in his life, and certainly not that up close, and  certainly not those certain areas.  So he was horrified. 
[01:48:30]  I think it comes across in the clip.  Marco has his lovely NSYNC T-shirt on with all the boys' faces emblazoned across the front.  Yeah.  He's got a bib on that says, I love Daddy, just in case any of that peach drips on him.  He doesn't want to ruin that NSYNC shirt.  And then he's got a bag full of hygiene products, oral hygiene, and breath mints, and gum, and  toothpaste, some kind of mouthwash.  Altoids.  Well, I'm sure with some of the places your face is gone, you carry that around a lot, 
[01:49:00]  right?  Not well.  I'm just thinking, you know, my overnight bag.  This is an overnight bag, sure.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  They're holding hands.  He is now kneeling down right in front of her.  She is sitting on the famous couch, and he's crying.  Marco?  Marco's crying.  What do I do first?  Okay.  All right, Marco.  Calm down.  It's okay.  It's okay.  What you do first, Marco, right when the song starts, and the beautiful gates of pleasure 
[01:49:30]  open up, you take the area right here, and you go sort of right below the...  Right to it.  Yeah, yeah.  She will point right to it.  My eyes open, though.  Okay, go.  Can I look at it first?  Yeah.  All right, give him a quick look.  Oh, my God.  No, Marco, get out.  Don't leave.  Marco, come here.  Marco, come here. 
[01:50:00]  Come here.  Come back.  Marco, come here.  Come here.  Just Marco.  He's confused.  No, Marco, come here.  Come here.  What was that?  No, Marco.  Marco, it's a woman.  Marco, come here, Marco.  I swear it was like a scene on Alien.  He freaked out.  And for the people playing at home, we just saw the hottest.  Right, right.  If you're a heterosexual guy, you would have just went like, oh, my God.  Good God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:30]  Marco.  All right, he is back, kneeling.  He was not looking, though.  Now, right when the music starts, she will again, the gates will open, and you will.  Why does it stick out like this?  No.  That's a woman.  That's a woman.  Marco's crying.  Marco, it's okay.  Making me feel bad.  There's no crying.  It'll make her feel bad.  I'm sure it's beautiful, but. 
[01:51:00]  It is beautiful.  He's got a muggy.  He's got his I Love Daddy bib on.  He is all set to go.  His NSYNC shirt.  He is kneeling before a beautiful girl.  Gorgeous.  And he is now ready, when the NSYNC song starts, to consume the peach, as they say.  Mm-hmm.  You ready, Marco?  Okay.  Let it rip.  And we have contact.  Oh, my God.  Is it working?  No, it's not working. 
[01:51:30]  No, no.  Keep going, Marco.  Randy, why are you, like, freaking out so much?  What is he doing in particular that's so freaking out?  He's so gay.  He what?  What is it?  It's so, I asked him what was the problem, and he goes, it's so gay.  What's he doing wrong?  Puffing on him.  Puffing on him, and he's coughing.  Keep going, Marco.  You're almost there.  It's almost done.  His legs are flailing.  It's as if someone was chomping his head off.  You're all man.  You're all man. 
[01:52:00]  You're all man.  Look at this gay guy go.  He's doing push-ups or something.  Is he getting better as time goes on?  No, he's getting worse.  He's getting worse.  Marco, say something.  Marco, how are you doing?  No, keep going.  You're almost there.  Say something.  Don't lose contact.  Don't we start over.  Say something.  Say something.  Is this the worst you've ever had?  I can't even explain this right now.  Five, four, three, two, one. 
[01:52:30]  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, you did it.  Marco, Marco, how does it feel?  Marco.  How does it feel?  I'm going to say.  There's a car that's around next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm willing.  You look fabulous.  O.P. and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well done. 
[01:53:00]  Ah, Anthony.  Stadium Auto Mall.  Yes.  Stadium Auto Mall.  Every day.  What is this?  I owe, I owe, so off to work I go.  We all know that tune.  Oh, God.  Here's another great piece of copy.  Every day the mailbox sings the songs of bills, bills, bills.  Everyone wants their money now.  Fortunately, at Stadium Auto Mall, they sing a different tune.  Stadium Stain...  Stadium sings, leave your money at home. 
[01:53:30]  Don't make monthly payments until next year.  Is that a tune?  Pick up any new Jeep or pick up any new Ford car, truck, or SUV.  Drive it home today.  You don't even think about making a payment until next year, 2002.  At Stadium Auto Mall.  No security deposit.  No payments.  Until 2002.  You need credit now?  They've got it.  That's right.  Stadium's goal to finance everyone.  When other dealers say no, Stadium says yes.  Stadium Auto Mall.  All you need to drive a car or truck out of their lot is a pen.  Give them a call. 
[01:54:00]  201-935-2400.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Bellevue, Angela.  Still waiting for her to call in today.  Making sure she's okay.  Seems like she's going off the deep end a little bit lately.  Well, we'll see.  Alien Ant Farm.  It's the O&A Show.  877-692-1027.  That's...  I hate this song.  I really do.  I don't know who the hell would pick that song to remake. 
[01:54:30]  And it just sounds so gay.  Alien Ant Farm, huh?  I didn't like the original.  I don't like that one.  Michael Jackson did that.  That's him in the background going, wow.  Wow.  Me crying.  Woo.  Woo.  I like playing this when I'm a less chill.  My children.  Allegedly.  Son of a bitch.  Hold on a second.  Yeah.  We were going to go to this guy from Columbus. 
[01:55:00]  He hung up.  Ah.  Did we get his info?  You stupid...  Ah.  Fall back.  Bad intern.  Uh-oh.  Who gets bad intern?  John.  John.  Warm beer John.  Leopard.  Leopard.  This is how we...  This is how we get other cities involved.  This guy from Columbus said he could be here tomorrow to fight Woody, and the guy from  Columbus has one leg.  Yeah.  He wants to take on the one-legged boxing champion, Woody.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  But John didn't get his info, and now the guy's just...  Oh, maybe he'll call back in the radio abyss right now.  Maybe he'll call back.  Sure he will.  Sure he will.  You were saying, Anthony.  Yes, Opie, speaking of the king of pop, who calls him that?  Who honestly calls him that?  The king of pop, Michael Jackson, he's doing a couple of shows in Madison Square Garden here 
[01:56:00]  in New York City.  42-year-old singer is going to celebrate 30th anniversary of concerts at Madison Square Garden.  And get this, his producer is offering a select group of people a chance to be part of an unforgettable salute  over two nights, one city on one stage featuring one man, man, use that term loosely, Michael Jackson. 
[01:56:30]  How's this for a deal?  So, for $50,000, what?  For $50,000, you get 10 seats to one of the concerts.  That's five grand a seat.  Included with admission, you get a special post-concert champagne and caviar all-star dinner in Carnival  at Tavern on the Green, where guests will have access to Jackson and receive a signed poster. 
[01:57:00]  I should have.  For $50,000.  How pompous.  $50,000?  How arrogant.  The tickets are $5,000 apiece, and you have to buy a block of 10?  You have to buy, yeah, this is a block of 10.  This is what they're selling.  You need $50,000 to buy 10 tickets to a Michael Jackson concert.  A slightly more economical deal.  Maybe, Opie, you can't swing the 50 grand.  For $30,000, you get the 10 seats. 
[01:57:30]  You get the Tavern on the Green poster package.  You get a signed poster at Tavern on the Green.  You get a signed poster.  They're calling it the Tavern on the Green poster package.  The poster package.  Like, he's going to walk around Tavern on the Green and hang out with everyone.  Right.  You get to see him for two seconds.  No, Opie, for the $30,000 package that I'm trying to sell you right now, you have no access  to Jackson.  Oh.  That's only the $50,000 package.  But do I get my signed poster?  Yes, you do get the signed poster.  So, for $20,000 less, I just don't see him, but I get the signed poster. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  Nice.  Right.  And for the very economical price of $15,000, you get the 10 tickets, and you get dinner.  Dinner and a show, $15,000.  For $10,000, can I have a chance to hit him over the head with a mallet?  That would be good.  I would like that.  Take the $100,000 package, and we're both fondled young boys together.  In the back room, a Tavern on the Green. 
[01:58:30]  Children under eight getting free, but they got to stay with me.  And I eat the champagne and caviar off of their hairless butter.  What's wrong with that?  And they get a signed genitalia.  Ah, sugar.  What an arrogant bastard.  What a tool.  Let's see.  He thinks it's back in the 80s again, where people would have paid for this. 
[01:59:00]  Let's see.  The invitation boasts a stunning array of...  A cunning array of stunts.  I love that old gag.  A cunning array of stunts.  The invitation boasts a stunning array of performers and dinner committee members.  Britney Spears, NSYNC, Whitney Houston, Mark Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Shaggy, and Quincy Jones,  among those that you will hang out with if you fork over $50,000.  $50,000 to the alleged pedophile. 
[01:59:30]  Allegedly.  Andy.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  All right.  Well, I was thinking for $15,000, you know, I'll take it.  I'll take the posters just so I can wipe my ass with them.  You want to just wipe with them?  Oh, yeah.  That's worth $50,000.  By the way, all these bands that are remaking these older songs...  Yeah.  You know why that's happening?  There's no talent out there.  There's no talent. 
[02:00:00]  There's no talent.  All these guys are just making noise.  All they can...  They don't...  They cannot put a pen to a piece of paper to write a song.  Well, there you go.  Don't you agree?  Hey, Farid, is our contract still yet?  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Andy.  Oh, my God.  I mean, no, thank you.  Could be the funniest inside joke I've ever heard in my life.  Yes.  I made about ten people laugh.  Eight of them in this building. 
[02:00:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Is this my manager?  Could you get Hanley Joel Osmond in here?  He's the newest of the cute little kids that I'd like to fondue.  Remember when I used to walk around with little Webster?  Remember him?  I'm sure he's scarred for life.  Hanging out with the king of pop, your cherry. 
[02:01:00]  He's always going around with the little kids.  Macaulay Culkin.  Oh, my God.  I like that.  I liked getting Webster and Macaulay Culkin together.  It was like a big Oreo of young, hairless Bud.  How pompous to walk around being known as the king of pop.  He called himself that.  No one, like, dubbed him that.  He dubbed himself that.  The self-proclaimed.  If you're a king of anything, you're a tool.  I was on the set.  I was on the set of Home Alone. 
[02:01:30]  And Buzz has a peeler.  I learned that.  Allegedly.  For $200,000, you can play Jackson 5 Whack-A-Mole.  And you get to hit my brothers with my sisters.  Ben, what's up?  Two things about him.  I saw him 10 feet away at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame backstage there.  I saw you too, Ben.  You're kind of cute.  A little too old for me.  But I like the boyish look. 
[02:02:00]  He wasn't allowed to ask him a question.  And he was whiter than a sheet of white paper.  He's so white.  And he's got so much.  I have vitiligo, they call that.  That's when you lose your skin pigmentation.  And not only that, he's one of those freaks that he ate at a restaurant that a friend of mine works at.  And no one could look at him.  No one could serve him.  You had to serve his, like, bodyguard and then serve Michael.  He's a freak like that.  Don't look at me.  I can't look at myself.  Have you looked at me lately?  All right. 
[02:02:30]  The guy from Columbus has hung up twice now.  John, what the F are you doing?  Why did he hang up again?  Well, now he called back for the third time.  I saw that he hung up.  I picked up his mic and got the info as soon as he was back.  There was a blank line on a...  It was black.  You're going the way of Jesse, my friend.  You look like you've been on a life raft for, like, three months in the ocean.  Exactly.  That's what that looks like. 
[02:03:00]  At the road show Saturday, it was really sunny out, but it was kind of cool.  It wasn't that hot because we were right on the water.  John got so completely burnt.  I swear to God, you look like the people they pluck off the rafts.  You look like some Cuban that's been on a tire tube.  My nose is going to fall off by the end of the day.  I know.  Stop peeling your nose.  Yeah, don't peel that.  Don't peel that.  Believe me, I'm not.  Okay.  Lee is calling back from Columbus.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  Lee, what's up? 
[02:03:30]  Lee.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's happening, man?  Listening to us on the big wazoo?  Yeah.  What's going on?  You tell us.  I hear you're looking for a one-legged boxer.  Yes.  I'd like to come up there.  Oh, yeah?  Well, what's your deal?  Well, what I'd really like to do is take my wooden stump and beat you over your...  He can't say the F word.  Holy crap.  All that for that.  Did he just say what I thought he said?  Oh, my God. 
[02:04:00]  Lee, I'll say it for you.  Baba Booey.  But he said the F word first, so we had to dump that.  Baba Booey.  Ouch.  You think that's going to get to us?  Whew.  Maybe if it was like 1992.  Yeah, that's a little old at this point.  That's embarrassing.  It's not like people are...  Wow, he got us, didn't he?  ...calling up Larry King every day and doing it.  I don't even know what to do now. 
[02:04:30]  What do you do?  He just threw us off our game.  I can't believe that got on the radio.  And they pull out the Baba Booey.  Oh, God damn.  Hey, you just catch that new show, the Cosby Show, too?  That's a great new show.  You just embarrassed your whole city.  Ugh.  I'd be embarrassed if I was from Columbus now after that guy represented you.  Sergio, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's everything?  What's up, man?  How about that QVC guy selling the Michael Jackson tickets? 
[02:05:00]  $50,000.  $50,000.  Hang out with the guy, but don't look at him, for God's sake.  You'll turn to stone.  It's like looking at the face of Medusa.  He's got the vitiligo, and I hear it's all the way down in his crotch.  Imagine how that scares the little toddlers that he exposes himself to, allegedly.  That's how we stay out of trouble.  Say allegedly.  Say allegedly.  Say allegedly. 
[02:05:30]  Look, I got his original nose.  It's $100,000 on the FlexPaint.  And the big.  My head hurts when I do that today.  I had too many Guinness last night.  877-692-1027.  George, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Listen, who's screening your calls today?  John and Stinky. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, they're doing a hell of a job.  You guys are some of the greatest callers all day long.  Yeah, we've had a bunch of bad ones today.  Oh, man.  I'm on Route 3.  Oh, wow.  Wait, wait.  Someone just wrote, F him on the screen.  Listen, I'm on Route 3.  I'm listening to the gay Marco bit.  I'm laughing hysterically.  Tears are rolling down my face.  I look over to my side.  I'm in dead stop traffic.  The whole place is laughing hysterically.  The virus continues to grow. 
[02:06:30]  All of Route 3.  Right on.  We're cracking up.  Right on.  Thank you, George.  Later, guys.  Got to go hear myself.  Speaking of which, we got gay Marco on the line here.  Marco.  Hey.  What's up?  What's up?  Why are you calling us?  I didn't call you.  I called you.  Oh, why did we call Marco?  Because he hooked up.  Because Rick wanted a date with me, I guess.  No, I did not.  Shut up his bag.  Oh, I know why.  Because the other guys on the line, Randy, you guys were talking yesterday, Gay Randy.  Right?  Yeah.  And I hear there's a little problem. 
[02:07:00]  Hold on.  Let me get Randy on the line with you.  Gay Randy.  Can you believe the timing?  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  Okay.  I emailed Marco.  Yeah.  You guys talked a little bit.  There was some interest.  Well, some interest.  They're two gay guys.  You gays are like dogs.  Anytime you find another gay guy, you've got to test them out.  Sniff me out.  Well, um...  Sniffing.  Marco asked for Randy's picture, right, Marco?  Sure.  And Randy sent Marco a picture? 
[02:07:30]  I did.  All right.  So they traded pictures.  I sent him a bunch of pictures for my webcam.  Okay.  So what happened, Randy?  Were they naked?  No, actually, they weren't.  No, they were all...  That's disgusting.  What?  Nothing.  I sent Marco about maybe half a dozen pictures.  Of yourself, Randy?  Yeah.  Actually, no.  I have a webpage on gay.com, which is...  There's a gay.com.  There's...  Oh, yeah.  It's like chat rooms and stuff.  You can hook up.  Okay, so...  It's a different person every night if you want to. 
[02:08:00]  So what happened?  I sent Marco this.  I said, you know, hey, how's it going?  You know, I can't believe I got through to the show.  I talked to you yesterday.  And he emailed me back.  I got his message around 9 o'clock last night.  He's like, you are a total cutie.  Oh.  And then he also said, I'm too old for you, and I got a boyfriend.  See you later.  Well, how old are you, Randy?  26.  And Marco, how old are you?  31.  I thought you liked him young.  I said, I'm too old for him, meaning that he probably wouldn't be interested in me. 
[02:08:30]  Well, let me make the judgment.  So I sent him my picture.  But I'm gay from Salem now.  No, you're not.  You just did him.  The one you just met this weekend?  Hey!  And he's called me like five times.  This is serious.  You're going to date someone in another state when you've got a guy that looks as good as  me who wants to date you in New York.  This is so gay.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  Well, wait, wait, wait.  I didn't hear what you thought of my picture.  What?  I didn't hear what you thought of my picture.  I thought it was a really good picture.  You were wearing some heinous purple shirt.  Hey!  Yeah, it was pretty bad.  And it looks like you had some guys, like, arm wrapped around you.  Yes, I did.  And he was cut out?  Who was that?  It was somebody I dated, so I cut his arm out.  How many people have you dated, Marco?  A few.  How many different men have you been with, Marco?  Probably about 1,100. 
[02:09:30]  5,000.  How many?  Probably about 1,100 or so.  What?  Jesus!  Miles of it.  He has had miles of it.  Marco, have you been tested?  Yes, I have.  Nothing yet, huh?  Nothing.  By NASA, have you been tested?  Yeah, really.  He's probably got some disease that kicks AIDS ass.  He's got something supersonic that only exists on some other planet, maybe.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's got a disease that just kicks AIDS ass.  Marco.  Just to let you guys know, I've only been with, like, ten people.  Oh, that makes all the difference in the world, Randy.  Then, honey, honey, I would rock your world. 
[02:10:00]  Well, you won't even give me a chance.  Here's gay Marco farting.  So, Marco, you're not going to give Randy a shot?  Well, he's very cute, but I just didn't think I was his type.  He's, I mean, he's very cute, but that's what he is.  He's, like, cute.  He doesn't have, like, a very distinct look.  What do you want distinct?  Marco doesn't...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, 
[02:10:30]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, that's pretty obvious,  Randy, but we can't say that on the air.  Watch your language, young man.  Let's just put it this way.  Oh, and A, you're looking for guys with one leg?  I've got three.  Oh, my God.  Look at Marco.  He goes, whee!  Oh, my God.  Now, how come there's no picture of that on your website?  Awful.  Because, you know, maybe, you know, have you ever been with a decent guy?  Yes.  That will send a picture with his shirt on? 
[02:11:00]  Yes, I have.  With his pants on?  Yes.  Who?  Uh, Greg, my new boyfriend from Salem, Massachusetts.  Oh, you're just a throwdown.  You said you already saw that stuff and you said.  Hold on.  Watch out with the description of what he's seeing.  Yeah, we can't see.  Okay.  Yeah.  But, Marco, you said you already saw the goods.  No, he was wearing a thong.  So, I mean, you can't see everything.  Trust me, you can see everything.  So, where do we leave this, boys?  Yeah, what are we doing?  Well, if... 
[02:11:30]  Marco, I'm definitely interested.  Well, if Randy wants to get together, we can meet at XL.  I hate that place.  What's XL?  It's a new game, but it's fabulous.  It's fabulous.  No, we can go to Barracuda, or we can go to the lure.  Barracuda.  Not the lure.  The lure.  Barracuda, which is a big, long fish that looks like a sea.  Not the lure.  I just wanted to shake up Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:00]  I'll meet you at XL.  All right, why don't you guys...  I'll meet you at the tube steak.  Yeah.  The manhole.  We'll go to the manhole.  XL, which is short for extra large.  XL, right.  Of course it is, Marco.  It's all about the schlong with you guys.  So, what's going to happen with you guys?  All right, well, we'll meet up.  I'll send Randy an email, and we'll meet up and see what happens.  All right, very good.  That sounds pretty good. 
[02:12:30]  All right, Randy.  And I don't think you're too old, Marco, because the oldest guy I've ever been with...  Yeah.  ...is 57.  Ew!  Oh, my God.  And you're 26?  You know, honestly, opening, Anthony, the only reason I did it was I needed a place to stay in New York.  Oh, you were antiquing.  Antiquing.  I only antiqued once, but I did do it.  How was that?  Do you want to know what, Randy?  The youngest I've ever been with was 17.  How old were you? 
[02:13:00]  Never mind.  You're like, I was six.  Hey, Randy, how is that yam bag hanging like melted Turkish taffy?  Oh, you don't even want to...  No, I didn't even see any of that.  Well, what did you have to do to stay in his apartment?  Just lay back.  Oh!  And how many times did you have to do it?  Like, how long were you in this apartment?  I was there for two weeks. 
[02:13:30]  Two weeks!  Dude, he set me up.  And how many times did you have to just lay back?  I think a dozen times.  What were you laying on, your stomach or your back?  No, not my back.  No tuchus lingus for me.  No, on my back.  Oh, my God.  This is getting too gay.  This is horrible.  That's the worst thing I've ever done.  Oh, yeah?  Marco, what's the worst thing you've ever done? 
[02:14:00]  Well, not that.  Eight out of Pete for NSYNC tickets.  That's true.  That's the worst thing I ever did.  Did you ever go home one night, Marco, and just feel like you really kind of, your dignity was just gone?  Yes.  And when was that occasion?  Probably about 12 years ago.  And this guy picked me up at this club, and he was so nasty and trolly.  He was disgusting.  But he offered to buy me a steak dinner, and I was like, oh, sure, okay.  And we went to, I think, like Peter Luger's, and I was so mortified because I saw somebody that I knew. 
[02:14:30]  And they were like, oh, my God, that man was so disgusting, you were with.  Yeah.  And he was.  He was awful.  Great.  Oh, that's it?  Was it Nathan Lane?  Was it Nathan Lane?  No, worse than Nathan Lane.  Bruce Willansh?  Worse than Bruce Willansh.  Look at these faggots talking about this.  You know, you guys love it.  It's better than everybody calling up, yelling Howard Sterncraft.  I know.  No, it's funny, though.  The phones are just exploding. 
[02:15:00]  Everyone's just screaming, going, stop this, stop this now.  Oh, please, they love it.  Dan from Jersey wants to point out that 1,100 guys is 550 feet of C units.  Hey, don't forget, you guys are adding San Francisco, right?  Oh, yeah.  They're going to be on every day.  You want to add to that market?  All right, why don't you guys go hook up and give us a call back, all right?  And we'll let you know what happens.  All right, Marco.  Okay.  Talk to you later, Marco.  Hey, gay Marco, AOL.com. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, trust me, I've already got it.  Read my bi-weekly column on foundrymusic.com.  Thank you.  And wait, my appearance today has been sponsored by Fresh Flush Disposable Douches.  Great.  Maybe I don't want to meet you.  I'm now being sponsored on every time I'm on here, I get paid a royalty by Fresh Flush.  Fresh Flush.  All right, Marco.  Okay, bye.  And Randy, let us know how it goes. 
[02:16:00]  Take it easy, ONA.  These guys are hilarious.  Like a vibrating butt plug in the back door, these are the gays of our lives.  Phew.  Wow.  John Black, I like your hiney.  We're going to have to get something really hot going on next because that was too gay, man.  Yeah, that.  They are, I swear to God, I'm sorry.  Gay guys are like animals. 
[02:16:30]  They're animals.  I don't know.  It sounded like Randy had some morals.  It was gay Marco that's giving it up for everybody.  I don't know.  He's sleeping with a 57-year-old guy for a room.  I mean, they're just animals.  Tim, what's up?  Guys, two words.  Bra bingo now.  Okay, let's, you know, you're going into the gay zone, da, da, da.

Stephen Lynch has a little song about being gay.  This is a song that I wrote, actually, a couple days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine, my best friend, we went out to a bar and we got really hammered. 
[02:17:30]  And we just had a really good time.  And I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times that you have with your pal when you're out drinking at night?  You know what I mean?  Sure.  I wrote this for my best friend, my friend.  This should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  It's touching.  I hope he's listening.

Um, I could get rid of that problem  Yeah, that is a problem  As you do that, Anthony  We'll explain the rules of what's in my pants  Well, we will ask Jamie to take the telephone she is on  And move it around, as per our instructions, on a certain area  And judging just by the sounds coming out of that phone  We will try to discern what hairstyle she is sporting 
[02:33:00]  Is it the natural triangular shape?  Is it the mohawk?  Which is, of course, the landing strip  Uh, is it the Hitler mustache?  Which is a mohawk that has been shaved down to just a little tuft of hair  Or is it the wood floor, also known as the JonBenet Ramsey?  Yeah, this could be challenging because I'm sure she has the nappy hair  Now, uh, Jamie, remember, very important on your part  I love that 
[02:33:30]  No clues, no hints as to what you're sporting down there  Until we ask you, what is in your pants, okay?
