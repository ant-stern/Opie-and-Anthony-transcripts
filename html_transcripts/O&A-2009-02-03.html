<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a detailed description of a severe mouse and cockroach infestation in their secondary studio, focusing heavily on the unsanitary conditions created by a particularly messy employee, repeatedly referred to as a hoarder and slob.  The hosts detailed the extent of the infestation – mouse droppings "raining down," a mouse running across one host's foot, and a nest near the messy employee's workstation – and decided to implement electric mouse traps, placing bets on who would catch a mouse first.  This discussion segued into a review of "Slumdog Millionaire," deemed good but not as hyped up as expected.  Several news items followed: Christian Bale's expletive-ridden rant from a Terminator film set, a Super Bowl pornographic clip incident, New York City Mayor Bloomberg's groundhog bite, and a California woman with 14 children.  The mouse trap discussion resumed, including further derision of the messy employee,  a debate about the F-word in broadcasting (referenced by the Bale audio), and a brief mention of a Jersey earthquake.  Kobe Bryant's 61-point game and a comparison of modern and older basketball strategies were discussed.  A more in-depth discussion on Mayor Bloomberg, his policies, and the groundhog incident, along with a broader look at Groundhog Day traditions, ensued. The show then circled back to the mouse traps and the upcoming airing of the unedited Bale audio, followed by a discussion of Wolfmother's breakup and Bruce Springsteen's Super Bowl performance and its impact on record sales.

The next segment began with a discussion about music downloads and a tangential conversation about Bad Company, transitioning to Wolfmother's internal struggles and lineup change.  The bulk of this section focused on the hosts' and callers' scathing criticism of the Steve Martin "Pink Panther" remake, using highly offensive language against Martin.  A middle-school teacher caller, Greg, echoed this sentiment. The Christian Bale audio was played, with Kent the movie guy providing context for Bale’s outburst. The audio featured extensive profanity and angry tirades.  Interspersed were updates on the studio mouse infestation, promotion of Jim Norton's stand-up shows and new persona, a news report about a skydiver whose instructor died mid-jump, and a discussion about the Super Bowl pornographic broadcast incident, including a caller who was a police officer discussing the public reaction and resulting 911 calls. Comedian Joe DeRosa was a guest in studio during this segment. The porn clip discussion included commentary on the physical attributes of women.

A significant portion focused on listener calls about the Super Bowl porn incident, with callers sharing humorous and incredulous accounts. One caller’s wife's reaction was mocked, and another claimed Comcast offered a $5 discount to viewers. The hosts also discussed their preferences regarding female physical attributes.  This was followed by a 911 call from a man pulled over by the police who called 911 for backup instead of cooperating. This led to a discussion about interacting with police, including audio of the 911 call and other clips of police interactions, some resulting in tasings.  The final segment addressed accusations of Led Zeppelin plagiarizing songs from blues musicians like Spirit and Willie Dixon, playing audio examples. The discussion included tangents about other bands accused of plagiarism (Cheap Trick, Green Day) and a humorous anecdote about John Fogerty suing his own label.  This concluded with a final audio clip related to the Zeppelin plagiarism claims and a Black History Month segment.

Another segment began by discussing musical riffs and plagiarism, playing examples contrasting Coldplay's "Viva La Vida" with Joe Satriani's "If I Could Fly." This transitioned into a discussion of various guitarists, including disparaging remarks about their styles and personalities. The mouse infestation and the messy co-worker, Buddy, were discussed again, followed by a significant portion on Anthony's hair transplant, with vulgar and offensive comments about his hair, Joe Biden's hair, and other topics. A call from Sam's eccentric father, with a handlebar mustache and unusual dietary habits (buttermilk, sardines, raw potatoes), ensued. The hosts engaged in humorous and often offensive banter with him, discussing his mustache, lifestyle, and anecdotes. Plans were made for E-Rock to try his unusual food combinations on a future show. Sam was present in the studio. The segment ended with further discussion of the mouse situation and Buddy's mess.

A final segment featured a farting stunt where Jimmy cupped a fart and directed it at Dave, causing him to fall.  Sam's dad's bizarre sardine, buttermilk, saltines, pickles, raw potatoes, and possibly gasoline recipe was discussed further, with E-Rock scheduled to eat it. Dave's departure was implied, possibly due to the fart stunt or another unrecorded event.  Audio of Charlie Gasparino's on-air profanity-laced outburst was played.  Jimmy Norton promoted his comedy gigs, including animal impressions and potentially involving fleas and a sea monkey act.  More details of Sam's dad's sardine sandwich (including strong onions) were given, and the segment concluded with Christian Bale's profanity-laced on-set rant.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. It's the Opie and Anthony show. We gotta get right into this.  For the people that weren't listening later, later on I guess, yesterday, we discovered  that we have a severe, not a little, a severe mouse problem in our other studio.  Yeah, not the one we're in right now. 
[00:00:30]  No. This place has its own problems.  Yeah.  I thought this was the place with the problems, but we're learning that our other studio has  cockroaches. We did the whole cockroach bit over there.  We set cockroach traps and we, what?  Like, cockroach motels, yeah.  We caught hundreds of them. Most of the tiny little baby variety, but a bunch of the big  mamas too.  Oh, huge.  That really creep people out.  Disgusting.  And then yesterday we're broadcasting and it was brought to our attention, and I guess 
[00:01:00]  we're the last to know, that there are mice all over the joint.  Yeah.  To the point where the interns and the behind the scenes guys, wait, how am I going to get  my peanut butter in here now, though?  All right. Anyway, they all see the mice running during the day. All of a sudden they're doing  work. One runs across the counter. One bumped into Danny as he was just doing his job. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, it ran right across my, like I felt something hit my foot. And I just brushed it off like,  oh, it was probably like my, my cup of my jeans or something. And then he goes, did you feel  that? I'm like, what? He goes, a mouse just ran across your foot. I'm like, I knew I felt  something.  Yeah.  That's sick. And there's, uh, there's, uh, droppings.  Mouse droppings everywhere.  Everywhere.  I thought they were exaggerating. They're like, you got to see this. So we all took turns looking  at this and it, it, it looked like it was raining mouse droppings.  There's a big long, in our, uh, office we used to use, there's a big long, uh, shelf desk area 
[00:02:00]  with a bunch of computers on it that, uh, the staff would use behind the monitors where like,  you know, no man's land where you empty DVD cases and stuff get thrown and there's a lot of wires  and stuff like that is the Ho Chi Minh trail of mice. It is where they are coming in and out to do  their damage. It's loaded, packed with, uh, mouse crap. Yeah. And, um, it, it stinks. You can smell 
[00:02:30]  it. Uh, they, uh, have laid waste to that. And the people that work there are disgusting slobs.  They're animals. There's one guy, he's an animal and it needs to be said, I don't give a crap if  we're going to get in trouble with HR. The guy's a hoarder. The guy's a hoarder and, and because of  that, it, it, it's made the, uh, mouse problem a lot worse. Yesterday I saw two pizza boxes and this 
[00:03:00]  wasn't like, Hey, we just finished some pizza. Uh, you know, when, when someone leaves, take the boxes  with you and we'll leave them here for the time being. This was pizza that was like celebrating the  Apollo Sawyer's mission. It was, the box was encrusted in grease from the pizza and there was a  slice in there or a mummified version of a slice that had like some paper towels over it. And I  opened it up with my foot to look inside and there were just mouse droppings and the stench of, of a 
[00:03:30]  rodent people that are in there. And one in particular is a disgusting human being that is, is just  infesting that place with rodents. Yeah. Once again, he's an animal and we found a nest near his work  area. Yeah. And you know, shredded paper, nice little nest where, where a mouse gave birth like  they do every, uh, week to a 6,000 young. Yeah. So, uh, with that said, we all have an electric 
[00:04:00]  trap in front of us. Yes. We, uh, found our electric traps. These are mouse traps that are quite  futuristic and quite exciting. Well, they are, they're, um, little plastic boxes. I would say it's  about six inches, uh, long by about, uh, three inches wide, uh, about an inch and a half high.  And, um, there's metal plates inside and each plate is getting a positive and a negative. Uh, 
[00:04:30]  there's, I'm sure some kind of a booster thing like a stun gun would have. So you put a little  nine volt battery in there and it increases the, um, the, uh, amperage and you put a little peanut  butter, a little dabble do you in the back of the trap. And the mouse crawls in the hole in the  front, works his way through a slight little maze so he can't back out. And in order to get to the  delicious peanut butter, he must stand on two of the metal plates, which he then, um, becomes, uh, 
[00:05:00]  like the Rosenbergs back in the fifties, giving away our hydrogen bombs here. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Zappo. Uh, it's a fun trap. No, no smacks, no, uh, sticky paper. You just electrocute  them and then dump them out. This, um, this was the trap I used in my old apartment that  wonderful that, uh, I think there's the actual trap by the way. I do believe I brought it  back. Yeah. This particular trap I'm holding has over 50 kills. Wow. This sparky, this thing 
[00:05:30]  rules as far as getting rid of, uh, your, your mice problem. Yeah. So without further  ado, uh, you, we take a little peanut butter, you scoop it on the back wall. You told them  about the maze feature, right? Yeah. There's a little slight little maze feature. It's a  couple of angled pieces of plastic. So the mouse can't back out. No. Once he's in, he's  committed. He's in for the long haul to the old death chamber. The little mouse, like, I think  there's a point where he goes, Oh, Oh, Oh, this doesn't look good, but that peanut 
[00:06:00]  butter smells delicious. And at that point you can't, he can't back out and his fate  is sealed. It certainly is. Who wants Jimmy? You're going to said you're, you're a trap  or what? I need a, I need a spoon. Yeah. Here, give a Jimmy's wait. I think I need a  little, another dab. I'm going all in here. And then what we have to do, you got to pick  a guy at, what are we doing? A hundred dollars? A hundred dollars. Our bets are usually a hundred 
[00:06:30]  dollars a man. That sounds good. Uh, then you pick a guy or we could pick one guy and  that person has to place the traps in the other joint. Cause we can't leave here right  now. Yeah. Um, I, I, cause I was clamoring that I want a good spot because that's a, it's  all about placement. It's like fishing. Of course it is. You got to find the good spot. So, um,  I found, I think, um, where I want to put mine, uh, write it down, write it down. I need 
[00:07:00]  mine. Uh, I need mine somewhere near that, that slobs area. Uh, that's, that's a good  spot, but, um, where are you going at a different spot? I'm going to go, you know, the desk with  the computers on it where behind the wires, uh, there's all that. I'm not up there, mind  you. Underneath. Cause they're on the floor too. I know it underneath against the wall.  It's gotta be against the wall though. Near the door or on the other side? Uh, like under 
[00:07:30]  the middle of the, of the desk. Okay. The area, but pushed against the wall with the  hole, um, facing toward my old desk. Okay. So that when they run by, run in the hole.  You got to do, you got to wrangle them. Jimmy, where do you want yours? No, I'm thinking  maybe, um, at a desk with a phone next to it. No, nothing at all. I don't know. I'm trying 
[00:08:00]  to think of where you awake. Yeah. I'm just watery eyes. You're not even awake yet. I'm  awake. It's my nose. My nose is decongestant of Afrin. I'm miserable right now. Uh, like a  St. Bernard. Your eyes are just tearing. Yeah. Excuse my nose. Are you sad, Jimmy? No, no,  no. Oh, good. When your Afrin wears off, you know, it's tingles. It's hard to breathe.  Yeah. Um, I'm thinking that when, you know where, if you walked out of the office that  we never use at XM, where the animal's desk is, but the other side, like under all those 
[00:08:30]  cabinets. Yeah. Um, no one is going for the obvious near the kitchen and stuff. I thought  of that too. You know what? Screw it. You could have the, you could, you could choose anywhere  near the animal's desk and, uh, put me near the kitchen in a good spot, Sam. Okay. Yeah.  Put me near the animal's desk. Okay. Where, where do I put this peanut butter? Right on  the back wall. Where the holes are? Yeah. Yeah. That way they can. And how do you turn  it? You turn it on like this, right? I forgot. It's been a while. Thank God. And it, it blinks  to show it's on. All right. Mine's set here. Take it over the other joint. Can someone just 
[00:09:00]  load mine up? Yeah. Just smear some peanut butter over there and get your, uh, I'll do  this. Get your little gloves. There you go. Get your oven. All right. As we set the electric  mouse traps. Okay. We're, uh, we're, we're, we're placing our bets. See, see who could,  see who could, uh, catch a mouse first. Our names are on top of the electric traps. What  does Jimmy write? I got that. I just gave it. I did, I did mine. I did Anthony's. No, you  did. What did you do? He gave you a tiny little dab. I need more. Jimmy has like a massive 
[00:09:30]  quam. I need more. That good? Yeah. All right. That's good. Like I did? Yeah. That's  cool. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There's going to be some lucky mouses. That's going to be  a problem. God, this smells good, right? And no one's over there right now, right? The  little holes in the back. It's just Mars. It's nice and pretty much nice and dark and nice  and quiet. That means the, the mice are rocking and all rolling right now. All right, cool.  So grab Jimmy's and let's, uh, let's get the, uh, show on the road. So the electric 
[00:10:00]  traps are set, a little peanut butter on the back wall. Our names are on top of the traps.  Sam will place them, uh, fairly in the areas we have chosen and we'll be checking what  every half hour. Yeah, sure. Have Mars check every half hour. Give us a call and, uh, then  let us know. And, and, and when the trap starts blinking, that means you got one. So Mars  doesn't even have to open up the thing. It just blinks to show you that you got some goodness  inside. All right. Uh, let's say hi to John in Denver. John. Hi, Anthony. I was thinking 
[00:10:30]  that Jim Nord would want a little cup of water inside of his trap for the mice that are thirsty.  All right. All right, you bastards. I didn't figure that. Enough about the mice. That is  funny. A little callback for everybody. It's the old, uh, white shorts joke. Come a haunting  me again. Oh yeah. Buddy. It just has like a little five alive. It's a little beverage  for the fella. Yes. They might have a burning mouth. Yeah. From all those chicken wings. 
[00:11:00]  Your ox will have wings in it. But garlic butter saw. Yeah. I was saying we should put  that in the trap. They're, they're almost ready to bring the traps over to the other  joint. Now, Ant, you said, uh, as we were, as we were getting ready for the show today,  you finally saw Slumdog Millionaire. Yes. And I was excited. I'm like, what do you think?  And you were like, eh, I, uh, I saw it, uh, a little more than when I went home. I said  it, it wasn't a, I didn't say it was a bad movie by any, uh, you know, any, what am I 
[00:11:30]  looking for? By any stretch of the imagination. That's what I meant. Okay. It takes a while.  It takes a while to ramp up over here to spool up. Yeah. Uh, yeah. I didn't say it was a  bad movie, but the hype that this thing is getting as far as genius Oscar winning all  these awards, I do not see that it merits this. I found it very slow moving, um, very  predictable. I liked the idea behind the fact that, you know, he's on this, uh, game show 
[00:12:00]  thing. It was better than the synopsis. I'll give it that, uh, that he's on this, uh,  who wants to be a millionaire, a millionaire, a millionaire. He's kind of like, uh, Ricardo  Montalban. Didn't he have that in him a little bit? Yeah, a little bit. A millionaire. A  millionaire. Um, I thought, uh, that dude's going to be on Regis today, by the way, just a  little, the game show host that care. Yeah. Uh, I, I thought like the fact that he, um, he  had the answers to a lot of the questions based on his life there and what had 
[00:12:30]  happened. And it was just kind of a fluky thing that the questions he's asked, he  knows the answer to. And that's how, you know, he kind of got the answer. I thought  that was kind of an original idea. Yeah. But as far as the, the movie itself, I  thought it was a little plotting. It just kind of moved along like, okay. And, uh, no  real surprises. I wasn't surprised by anything. You know, oh, oh, the bad guys. Oh, you know, 
[00:13:00]  oh, I hope this is a good camp for kids. No. Oh, this is horrible. Yeah. But what they  did to the kids. Yeah. That was kind of, you know, that was rough. That was rough. You  know, we're, we're talking in, uh, I don't want to ruin it for anybody. We're trying not  to do the spoiler thing here. But, uh, like I said, not a bad movie. I didn't sit there  and go, oh, I'm watching this piece of crap, but not this huge. Oh my God. It's  another one of these. Um, and, and Ronnie had talked about this before, uh, from 
[00:13:30]  Ron and Fez, one of these independent movies that come out that people just  gush over like Juno and, and things like that. Um, um, but this was a big  production. The one with, uh, uh, you know, sunshine. Um, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That  one with a little girl. Yeah. Yeah. But this was a big production, man. This  wasn't a little independent film. No, no. Yeah. No, it's considered like an  independent film just because it's not, it's not in wide release. It's not,  you know, it's one of these, it's kind of from, you know, foreign film kind of a 
[00:14:00]  thing. It looked great. You know, I thought it was filmed very well. It  looked really good. Uh, when they're chasing the little kids through the, the  little narrow, um, streets or the slums, whatever it was of their slums, I  thought that was done very well. But, uh, what about the poopy head? Eh, eh.  You know, all right. Every, every answer he had because of something awful in his  life too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really awful stuff. Yeah. Yeah. That, that I thought  was cool. It was a good idea. It just didn't, I, I didn't, I didn't turn the 
[00:14:30]  movie off and then go like, wow, I got to go to IMDB. When I see a really good  movie, I got to go to IMDB or message boards. I got to like see what other  people thought about it, find out like things about it. That's when I know I really  enjoyed a movie or, or hated a movie. Like I'll do that. Uh, but eh, eh, I  think the hype really, this thing is overhyped and I didn't find it to be, you 
[00:15:00]  know, uh, worthy of that hype. It was good, but you know, maybe we hype it too  much too. It's like when you hear about a movie from everybody, like, Oh my God.  Yeah. You know, but it's like your expectations. Everybody is just gushing  over this. What about the music? The everything. The music was cool. What  about the Bollywood moment as the credits were rolling? I love that. That was  funny. I like that little dance. Yeah. To know that they all, I want to do that  dance. Yeah. To know they all got along in the end. Yeah. Thank you, Jimmy. The bad  guys are dancing with the, uh, the good guys. Yeah. It was sort of like the end of a 
[00:15:30]  Broadway show when they all come out and take their bows together. Yeah. This was the  song. It will get stuck in your head too. It certainly will. I couldn't stop for two  days. And then they had that other take your money song. Yeah. Yeah. With the gunshots  in it. M.I.A. Yeah. All right. Well, I'll say that I was surprised at the ending. I'm  not going to say what it was, but I was surprised that they went the way that he  ends up as a customer calling thing for Dell. It was very shocked. And his name was Dave. 
[00:16:00]  Dave. My name is Dave. All right. What was your best movie of the year then? We got Oscars  right around the corner. I know. That's just it. I got to, I got to, um, kind of look at  that, but I really don't see movies that, um, oh, we got Revolutionary Road. But you  have to see this. I'll see that one. Oh, great. Don't even bother with that. Oh, no, you  have to. It's great. Actually. It's great. I heard you yesterday. Actually watch Revolutionary 
[00:16:30]  Road and we'll have a nice discussion tomorrow because that, that brings a lot of hate into  your soul. That movie. Ugh. I didn't find it depressing at all though. I feel like the  press thing was like, well, that's an hour and 45 minutes. You just don't get back. Yeah,  exactly. My favorite movie of the year was Iron Man. The more I think about it, but you  know, of course you're not going to give that a best picture nod. Yeah. But that was the  best movie of the year for me. Hmm. I liked the Slumdog Millionaire a lot. I'll have to think  about it. As far as the movies, they're, um, they're, they're putting into consideration. 
[00:17:00]  I like Slumdog Millionaire the best. And I saw, I think just about all of them. The  only one I didn't see was the reader. Cause I, I heard it was like a chick flick, but  now, uh, brother wheeze and now Kevin Smith yesterday, both say it's not really a chick  flick. It really isn't. It's actually a really good movie. So I think I'm going to try to check  that out in the next day or two. I'm going to have to look and, uh, you know, review what  I've seen. The, the thing, the unfortunate thing is, as you all know, I don't really  go out to the movies a lot. You don't go out. I wait for screener copies or, um, the 
[00:17:30]  old, uh, bootleg. Uh, but, but, um, so I haven't seen a lot of those movies. I'll get  that. I'll get around to it. Yeah. And I'll look and see what I have seen and pick my favorite  Slumdog. It's up there. I mean, it's a good movie. I'm not saying it's bad, but not worthy  of the hype and the gushing that it's getting from the, um, all these critics and the awards  and things like that. I'm sorry. All right. Don't see it. Speaking of movies, everyone's 
[00:18:00]  talking about the Christian Bale blowout. Oh, that is fantastic. What? I, you haven't  heard. Oh, Jimmy. I like him more now after this blow up. Really? Yeah. He's fantastic.  He's just an angry, mean, nasty man. He apparently was filming a scene for the new Terminator movie  that he's in. Yeah. And, uh, the director of photography seems to have stepped into the  scene and Christian was a bit upset about it and went on a, uh, about a four minute tirade 
[00:18:30]  about, uh, how this guy, uh, and I can't even say what he called him, what the names he was  throwing around, the language he was using, how he should be fired. He never wants to see  him again. Doesn't want to work with him again. The F word just being ballied about he, and,  and just serious. He was not kidding. And he was pissed. There's a lot of F words, man.  He was mean and nasty. Same guy that hit his mother at the premiere of the, that's what I was 
[00:19:00]  saying. That's what I was saying to Anthony. I'm like, wow, maybe, maybe the mom had a point.  Maybe she was onto something. I love this guy. Christian Bale's the best. We'll, we'll get into  the audio after the break. He seems to treat everyone. Yeah, we do. Seems to treat everyone  like Paul Allen. Hey, Paul. Yeah, we got the audio. We'll do that next. Also, uh, everyone's  talking about the Super Bowl porn clip. We finally got the audio. Finally. It was a big story 
[00:19:30]  yesterday. I guess in Arizona, the local TV station that, you know, doing the Super Bowl  and, uh, I don't know what part of the game, but all of a sudden it went to a porno for about  20, 30 seconds. Like, like, like, like where you saw stuff. So intentional. Yeah. Somebody  did. Apparently some guy, uh, Danny says some guy was, uh, trying, I guess, to do his best  impression of meat spin. Oh, really? But it was more like meat pendulum. Yeah. It was, uh,  it was, it wasn't like the middle of a scene, let's say. It was more like the beginnings of 
[00:20:00]  a scene. Yeah. They had just geared up. Why couldn't the guy, whoever did this, because you know,  it was intentional. Why didn't he go the distance and just get to one of the most horrific parts  of this film and then pop that on? He couldn't go all in. He couldn't go somewhere in his head.  He was like, uh, this is as far as I could go. If you're going to do it, you're right. You got  to go like ATM. Oh, you're going, yeah. ATM. Let's do ATM. DP. You know, we're talking something 
[00:20:30]  real good. Well, we got the clip. It's, it's, it's good. Even the radio and we'll, uh, turn  people on to where the video clip is after the break as well. And then you got the mayor  of New York city getting bit by that groundhog yesterday, a giant red. And you got a California  woman with 14 kids. That story's got legs. We got lots to do today. It's 28 of them.  That's your math skills. People talk. I was voted boy. Most likely to do quick multiplication  four years in a row. Only if times by two. Well, that would have been eight years in 
[00:21:00]  a row. And we'll check it with Sam next or two years in a row. If that's how we came  to four, I'm too good as he sets the mouse traps trying to get to break here. Opie and  Anthony will continue. All right. Good morning to everybody. Opie and Anthony. Good news.  The traps are set. You're just tuning in. We got a severe mice problem at our other studio  and where the guys work. And, uh, we decided to set electric traps with our names on  each trap. And we're doing a little betting today. We're trying to find out who could 
[00:21:30]  catch a mouse first. This trap, uh, electrocutes a mouse first. Yeah. There's a mouse problem  over there. Sam, you set the traps over there, right? In some good locations. Yeah. They're  all set where you wanted them. And all the locations have been isolated. So they won't  be disturbed. Oh, nice. Well, there's not a lot of people over there right now, right?  Right. There's only a few people, but the office is all set off and the animal's desk has  been completely blocked off from people. I hope that disgusting guy is found electrocuted  with peanut butter on his finger, trying to like get some for a sandwich or something. 
[00:22:00]  He's a hoarder. Slob. He's a hoarder, you think? Absolutely. Did you see the corner  that he's in? It's, it's a wreck. It's everything. I saw yesterday that used coffee cup, a paper  coffee cup used, had like gunky coffee on it. It was spilled on the desk. And he seemed  to have just taken a handful of staples and thumbtacks and used that as like a little storage  place for his staples and thumbtacks without rinsing it out or anything. Just a used coffee  cup. You know, he's so paranoid about somebody taking his chair that he chains it to his desk. 
[00:22:30]  He chains. Oh, yeah. Get a bolt cutter. Get a bolt cutter. Yeah, for real. That chair  is going. He's a, he's a nobody in this business. Throw his chair out on the street. Do you have  some of that ass spray? Yeah. Spray that chair. Spray the chair. Done. I said just throw it  on the street. Let one of the homeless guys grab it. You know what? Let it start to hang  around the building. Leave it right in front of the building. So when he walks in, he'll  be like, I think that's my chair, but it can't be because it's chained to my desk. It can't  be because no one would actually. With the chain on the seat. Yeah. No one would actually 
[00:23:00]  put it outside. Yes, Z-Rock. We've tried. He used to chain it to this filing cabinet that  rolls. So we used to take the filing cabinet and the chair and put it like out in the hallway  near the freight elevator or something. So we started chaining up the filing cabinet to  the actual desk itself. Yeah. He locks up paper goods supplies, coffee stir. It's like stuff that  you don't have to worry about people stealing. Coffee stir. Except him. Yeah. This guy refuses  to leave our facility. Refuses. He's the only one left from the old days. The old guard. Can we take 
[00:23:30]  his chair down in the freight elevator and chain it up to like the muni meter outside the building?  That's a good idea. Because we'll have to see it coming into the building. Yeah. Like a delivery  guy's bicycle. Yeah. We'll get a new lock so he can't even use his key. That's great. Just  chain it outside. Do you think the guy that he file trades online with, that janitor, that  Mr. Whipple looking pedo over at XM will help him? File trading. Yeah. A couple of creeps.  Oh, they are. Is Mars going to be checking electric traps every half hour or so? Yeah. He's 
[00:24:00]  going to be calling in every half hour. All right. And we have a little surprise once we get  over there. Yeah? Yeah. All right. You've got to keep listening to the radio show. Yeah.  We're all about TSL, right, Stump Brain? 877-212-ONA. We're getting the Christian Bale audio. You've  got to hang out for just a little longer. We're going to have it for everybody. I don't even  understand how it can be played here. We're going to do it with the beeps because it's just  worth it. Wow. It's a good rant. Also shows that you should just let the F word on TV and  on radio because we all use it. If Christian Bale uses it, then we should all be able to use 
[00:24:30]  it in public. What percent of the people walking around New York City, let's say, don't use  the F word? For real. It's got to be way less than 1% of the population. Less than 1%.  So why, if it's all about the masses, why can't we insist that the F word be on TV and  on radio? Because those 1% complain. Right. And then they make it seem like everybody doesn't 
[00:25:00]  want to hear it. I mean, we've got to start somewhere. You allow the F word. I understand  I don't even understand. I think you should just allow it all. But at least the F word  at this point. I mean, come on. Everyone uses it. Even the little kids out there are using  the word like it's nothing. It's not a, you know, doesn't necessarily have to be a sexual  term. Of course, it's barely used as a sexual term. Matter of fact. Right. It's usually  just used as, you know, you're mad. Hey, you know the news is they get the Christian Bale  audio, which we'll have on the radio in a few minutes here. Earthquake in Jersey last 
[00:25:30]  night. Oh, yeah. This happens, what, every year? I think we get one, maybe, maybe one  a year. Yeah. And then these little, like, rumbles. It's more like a, that's what like  an East Coast, East Coast earthquake feels like. It doesn't shake. Yeah. It feels like  something dropped on the floor, something real heavy. Yeah. But they said that we certainly  could have a big one in the Northeast. Oh, I bet they'll do a special on the news about  it. Yeah. Earthquake in the Northeast. Could the big one destroy our city? Right. We'll 
[00:26:00]  tell you. I'm sure they, they will work that angle today. And the geologist will get on  and say, well, um, quite frankly, the faults aren't really that bad here. You'll get an  occasional tremor, but nothing, uh, like, uh, California or anything. Okay. Well, thank  you. Right. So you're saying, no, we can't. No, they'll never acknowledge the guy said no,  because then at the end of it, he'll go, but there is a slight possibility. Slight  possibility. You're right here. A possibility. Wow. And, uh. Well, there was an earthquake 
[00:26:30]  in Jersey last night. It woke me and Wendy up. It's earthquake time. Douche. Hey, leave  him alone. Oh, stop it. Leave him alone. Bruce. Uh, somebody on Insta feedback. And the ground  was shaking and my Chevy was in the garage. Ugh. He really has a Jersey obsessed ass. Why  the hatred for the boss, man? I hate the boss. Because he's not the boss. Yeah, he's the 
[00:27:00]  boss. Hire me, Bruce. See? No boss. He's the boss. You saw him up there. Well, the boardwalk  was shaking. Was it? At the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, we felt it. Where was the epicenter?  Newark. Newark. Shut up. Eat him. You don't like My Hometown? I love that song. In my  hometown, there was an earthquake in my home. Oh, wow, wow, wow. That's like a bad for 
[00:27:30]  Monaghi. 10th Avenue fault line. I guess we need a few, uh, Bruce songs. Yeah, Bruce. You  know, like I'm on fire. I love that one, too. Well, the ground starts to crack. Earthquake  in my feet. One of the finance and feedbackers writes, uh, earthquake in Jersey. What? Did  E-Rock fall out of bed this morning? Oh, poor E-Rock. Oh, my God. Not even here to defend 
[00:28:00]  himself. Really no reason to talk like that. He's too busy eating his fifth breakfast. Hold  on. Robin Williams from Moscow on the Hudson. How do you feel? Oh, no. Ah, the new crop.  There we go. A few new interns. I think, yeah, I guess he has a little Jersey. He doesn't  even know what we're talking about. That's just amazing. No. All right, so you got an  earthquake in Jersey, which means nothing. We get one or two of these a year. It shakes  for a second. It's nothing like the California earthquakes. Yeah. Or the tremors you get out 
[00:28:30]  there. Also, uh, Kobe Bryant. We were just talking about this a week or two  ago. Kobe Bryant, 61 points at the Garden last night, setting the record, beating out  Jordan. I think Jordan did 55. And Bernard King had the record. 60. Bernard King was  old school. That guy was beat up when he did 60 at the Garden. He did it two games in a  row, I think. Yeah, he had bad knees. He always was taping his fingers. He was a mess, but  a scoring machine for the Knicks way back when. And Kobe scored 61 last night. Lakers beat 
[00:29:00]  the Knicks, 126 to 117. I was just talking about this, though. They sat him. He only  played 36 out of the 48 minutes. He only played three quarters of the game. And my  argument is, let these guys go the distance. Let's get one of these crazy... He could have  had 80 points last night. He would have easily had 70 if he played the other 12. But they sit  these guys because they're worried about injury and stuff. And my thought is, like, this would 
[00:29:30]  be great for the sport. You would get major headlines. He's getting really good headlines  as is. But if he shot 75, 80 points last night, that would be a huge story and it would be  great for the Lakers franchise. And what I would suggest is, you tell Kobe, look, hang  out around the perimeter and just shoot the threes. Don't get injured. Don't drive toward  the basket. Because I think that's what they worry about the most. You know, their star player  getting hurt in a game that doesn't mean anything anymore. But the old school guys, they stayed  in there and they just jacked up the points. Yeah. I just don't like how they play the 
[00:30:00]  game these days. That's one of their strategies now. It's part of the game.  Yeah. It's frustrating if you're a basketball fan. Because, you know, I'm a Knick fan. But  you know what? Kobe's scoring 61 and he's sitting out 12 minutes. No. At that point, I want  him in there and I want to see, you know, how many more points he can score.  Don't you think he wants to, like, extend the record so it's harder for anybody else to beat?  You know, you kind of do want to do that. And you know it's coming. He's probably running  up and down the court and he doesn't even want to look toward the sideline of Phil Jackson 
[00:30:30]  because he knows Phil's going to take him out at any moment. And as soon as that call  is made and he goes toward the bench, he must be so bummed. Like, oh my God, I was in the  zone. I could have got 70, 80 points tonight. Or more and then push the record up. But  no. That's just an amazing game for Kobe last night. Yeah, Bernard King did it and then  the next night he did it again. That was just to me really... Back to back, right?  Yeah. You were saying that. But 61 points in 36 minutes is just... That's just amazing 
[00:31:00]  basketball. I was a Lakers fan. You know, the Magic, Kareem, James Worthy era. I was a  Celtic fan during that whole time. I just liked it. Bird, McHale. Yeah. You know. A bunch  of ugly, ugly people. Dennis Johnson, they were horrible. Parrish. The freckly Dennis Johnson.  It was terrible. Yeah. It was terrible. And the stupid and the disgusting Detroit Pistons,  uh, Lambeer and Vinny the Microwave Johnson. I just, you know, Isaiah Thomas, when he played  with them, I hated his guts too. I know we're going a little old school, but that was a 
[00:31:30]  great era for basketball. Yes. Lambeer was just not a nice guy. Yeah, his own teammates  hated him. He'd fist fight with his own teammates. He was a douche. He was the Christian Bale  of basketball. Right. He was a tool. He was always a problem. Always. But, uh, Shaq, so you  can't not like Shaquille O'Neal. I mean, everyone likes the guy. He's a great player and he  wins. He's not a, you know, he can't free throw with a crap, but he's just a winner.  Right. And Kobe, without him, to me, is never going to do anything. Yeah. I still wanted  to see Kobe do it, even though I'm not a big fan of his, but nah, whatever. 61 is still 
[00:32:00]  a fine effort. I just like the way he conducts his personal sexual life. I think that's  appropriate. Well, yeah. Bite her back and show her who's boss. That's the only way to handle  it. You got to give him a little credit, because, you know, a little time goes by and  that, that wife of his is like, ah, no biggie. Whatever. It's all good. It's in  the past. It's in the past, I say. It's all good. Uh, and then Bloomberg just throwing  a few headlines at everybody today. He got bitten by that, uh, that, uh, that groundhog  yesterday. We kind of were talking about it on the show. Staten Island, uh, Chuck. I 
[00:32:30]  don't know. It's his name. It should be Staten Island Chuck. Everyone's jumping on the  bandwagon. There's the famous Punxsutawney Phil. Everyone remembers him. And Newsday, Newsday  has a list of other groundhogs just in our area. And we're a national show. I think some  of the listeners should call up with the names of their groundhogs in their area. I'd be  very surprised if every state didn't at least have one. Of course they did. One of these  groundhogs. So they could have some hoopla every year. We got four in our area alone. 
[00:33:00]  Really? And then Bloomberg got bit. I don't blame the groundhog. I'm sure the groundhog  was wondering if he was trying to get into his pockets to grab some chains. Grab some chains.  The gopher tax. This Bloomberg sucks and somebody needs to say it. You know, it's easy to blame,  uh, the city's woes on the economy. Guess what? This was all happening before the, the economy  collapsed. He wants to tax plastic bags when you go to the grocery store. You didn't see  this coming? I hope in a week Bloomberg is on all fours walking down the street foaming 
[00:33:30]  from the mouth. That would be, that would be hilarious. Imagine, rabid mayor. We have  a rabid mayor. Just walking the streets, just all, don't get near him. With his hair just  a mess and just, he's grown a beard and his clothes are tattered. Yeah. They can't find  him. He's just, he's just eating squirrels in the park somewhere. He's going through the  garbage. Right. Like a raccoon. Yeah. He's, uh, he's wrecking the squirrel lanes with that 
[00:34:00]  douche. You're driving along 24th street in New York, crossed over 8th Avenue. Oh my God.  Supposed to be two or three lanes. Two lanes to your right and left are like, have white  lines with like the stripes in them. Yeah, the stay the F out. What is that? What are you  doing, Mike? No idea what, he is so anti-vehicle. Because he's a spoiled billionaire who has state  troopers that take him on the train. Give me your state trooper bodyguards or give me  one of them. I'll take the train everywhere. All hours of the night, Mike. You know, taking  the train is never a hassle for Mike. Never. It's never a problem. Or just driving around 
[00:34:30]  the city even. Or driving if he needs a little motorcade action to take him somewhere. One  or two cops. He could go from uptown to downtown in Venice. Traffic doesn't mean anything to  him. Right. Lights don't mean a thing. No. I don't like this guy, man. I'm weird.  Like, I don't hate him. I think that the fiscal crisis is not his fault. Everyone's feeling  it, but. It's all crap in the end. This guy knew that the city was heading toward problems.  I'm telling you. Yeah. Plastic bags are being taxed now. I mean, it got to that point and 
[00:35:00]  you couldn't figure something out ahead of time. He started that a while ago. He was thinking  of that one. Five cents. You go to the supermarket. It's just the principle. You go and get your  groceries. And now for each plastic bag and they double, you know, they double wrap,  right? Yeah. Five cents a bag. That's just, what are you doing? How bad do you need change?  Well, they've added every shopping experience to the tax now. It's not just grocery stores.  Every time you get a plastic bag from anywhere, it's going to have the tax. But isn't plastic 
[00:35:30]  better for the environment or paper is? Plastic is. So you were supposed to take plastic.  Well, he's encouraging you to bring your, this is how they spin it to make believe it has  nothing to do with trying to get more money from you, the citizen. They're like, well,  it's, it's healthier for the environment. We're encouraging people to bring their bags  to the grocery store, usable bags. No one. So we don't use as much plastic bags. That's  all crap that they throw at you. Food. It's about making money. Food collects in your  bag. No one's bringing their own bags. No one's bringing their bags. Every once in a while 
[00:36:00]  you see that, that older hippie chick that bring her own bag to the grocery store. And you're  like, ugh, that's, that's a hassle. I don't even use bags.  Jesus, man. You can't say, try to shove like five tuna cans in one. You didn't know what  you can. No, we should do. We should go to a grocery store and just, just get about a  hundred or $200 worth of groceries and say, no, we don't want any bags. I'm just going  to carry this out to my car and just make a hundred trips from the register. No, no, don't 
[00:36:30]  put it in there. I'm not going to pay the tax. No. And you'd hold up the line. You  just take out a few cans at a time and put them in your trunk. Park way at the back end  of the parking lot. So each trip takes you five minutes. I just whistle a happy tune  the entire time. Oh, you'd be a pain in the ass. That rules. This guy's a rich douche.  And that's what's annoying is he's taxing people. He knows that every regular working  class person has to use, you have to use bags when you shop. You have to. And we bought 
[00:37:00]  the whole thing. Paper's bad. It's messed up in the environment. They killed all these  trees. Then he sold us on plastic. Everyone sold us on plastic. We're using plastic and  now they want to tax that. It's like, what do you want? If you bring the plastic bags  back, can you say, can I have all my nickels back? That's a good question. I don't know.  Here you go. So I'm not using these anymore. Getting with the groundhogs. So this four in  our area, that's where we start with this. You got the Punxs of Tawny Phil, right? You got  the Holtz Phil Howl out there on Long Island. You got Staten Island Chuck. That's the one 
[00:37:30]  that bit the mayor. Yeah. Gave him an impressive little wound there on his finger or whatever.  That's the hero. The hero. And then this is the one that made us kind of laugh because  we're Long Islanders, Ant and I. Malvern Mel. Malvern. Malvern has their own groundhog.  That's got to be a rat. Can't kill a groundhog. Whoever said you was one, Mel.  And Mel did not see a shadow. Malvern Mel. What do you got there, Travis? These are all 
[00:38:00]  the famous groundhogs. Oh, my God. From where? Everywhere? Punxs of Tawny Phil. He's always  at the top. He's the Elvis. He's the number one. Woodstock Willie in Illinois, of course.  Jimmy the Groundhog from Wisconsin. W-I-A-R-T-O-N Willie. I like how you said Woodstock Willie.  And then you said from where? Illinois. You said from Illinois, of course. Oh, yeah.  I think the first thing I thought was Woodstock, New York. Who wouldn't think it's Woodstock,  New York? I like Woodstock Willie from Illinois, of course. You couldn't let me slide today, 
[00:38:30]  huh? It's early. Just made me laugh. Yeah, it's funny. How do you say W-I-A-R-T-O-N Willie?  Say it again. W-I-A-R-T-O-N. I've never heard of that name. W-I-A-R-T? W-I-A-R-T-O-N?  W-I-A-R-T-O-N? How do you say the W-I-A-R-T-O-N? W-I-A-R-T-O-N Willie?  Staten Island, Chuck. General Bergard Lee, Ph.D. Oh, that's got to be, yeah. That's Atlanta.  Down south. Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. All right. Dunkirk Dave. If he sees, and if 
[00:39:00]  that one sees a d***, he gets scared and runs into it. It's going to be six more weeks  of crime. Wow. You know, you know what's going on down there if it's named after Robert  E. Lee. Yeah. Yeesh. 
[00:39:30]  Saskatoon Evan from Canada, yes. Malvern. Oh, well, that figures. Evan. Oh, Malvern has a male  and a female. Malvern Mel and Malvern E. Melissa. Brandon Bob, Balzac Billy. What?  These names. Wait, yeah. Hold on. Balzac Billy. These sound like names from our message boards.  Yeah. And then there's Michael Hunt from Schenectady. And Ivan Kutchikoff from Western Seattle. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, and look, did Haywood Jablomi see his shadow? That's true. He pops out. If there's  no shadow, he spits an awful substance in your face. Hey, we got the, Dan in Atlanta's got  a little something on their groundhog. Dan in Atlanta. Oh, you guys already just went over  it, so. All right. Wait, your groundhog's really called Robert E. Lee? Well, it's Beauregard  Beauregard Lee. He's named after the Confederate general. Sure. Uh, you know, Atlanta's not 
[00:40:30]  exactly huge in terms of tourism, and so a lot of the local tourism bureaus just latch  on to stupid Confederate craft. Hey. Everyone's over it now, but whatever. All right. I don't  think everyone is. Watch out. Not everyone. Not everyone. They still like flying their flag.  Oh, my God. Shuban Kati Sam, it looks like, from Nova Scotia. Gary the Groundhog. Jesus.  Spanish Joe from Ontario, Canada. Wacky Canadians trying to get into the act. Yep. 
[00:41:00]  They're always trying to take one of our things. And make it their own. And make it their own.  God, just stick to smoking pot. Stoners. As they keep smoking pot, we just take another one  of their hockey teams. Why don't they do that? And bring them south. Yeah. Why don't you just  have a groundhog that comes out, gets stoned, and says, screw it, I don't care. Right. And  just hangs out. I'm going to sleep the winter away anyway. Yeah. I'm just, I want to go  to sleep. I'm tired and stoned. Sir Walter Wally from Raleigh, North Carolina. Pardon 
[00:41:30]  me, Pete, from Tampa, Florida. Ew, pardon me, Pete. Pardon me, Pete. I wonder how many times  pardon me, Pete has been arrested in shrubs. Looking through people's windows. Pardon me.  Pardon me. Oopsie. Who are you? I'm Pete. And then he bites you and runs away. Pete's  a creep. It spies Pete. It's Weirton, I guess. That one we couldn't figure out. Thank you  to Eric in Ontario. Octo Raro Orphy. Wow. What? That's in Quarryville, Pennsylvania. Holtzville 
[00:42:00]  Hal and then Buckeye Chuck. That's just some of the famous groundhogs across America. They  all have to get in on the action. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's probably just a very limited  list. Show some of these little tiny places. I hold in my hand the Christian Bale audio  finally. Ah. We had to like make it a little friendly for this side of the radio show.  All right. Since we're betting on our mice today, we got mouse traps over at the satellite 
[00:42:30]  studio. Yeah. We have a mouse problem. Yeah. And we each picked a mouse trap. Yeah. We'll  be checking the traps. We'll be checking the traps after the break. Yeah. And we each  bet on that. But how much do you want to bet since we're betting that a curse will still  be in that audio? Oh, really? I just I don't think we've ever had audio. And I'm not blaming  it. It's not like a fault thing. It's just so many curses in that. My favorite one recently  was the Barack Obama song. We're playing the clip where Barack's going to take his money and 
[00:43:00]  give it all up to me. Right. That song. Oh. And then I listened to the rap song before  the show. And we're like, yeah, perfect. There's no problem here. Let's air it. We didn't hear  that there were two or three F words in there. A couple S words. Mother effort. Oh, yeah.  It was loaded. It was loaded with stuff that would have got us fired. But we just didn't  hear it. We're jaded. All right. We'll do a bet. Do you think there's at least one in  there, huh? Yeah. There's close to 40 curses. I know. That's what I'm saying. Something 
[00:43:30]  has to. So. Huh? Sam did the edits? Yeah. I will. I'll take some action. You think he's  going to take some action on this? I have confidence in my co-workers. I was hoping  E-Rock did it. I'll say that there are. I think everything will fly perfect. Yeah. Yeah.  Sounds pretty good. And then later on, we'll play it unedited over at Seriously. Oh, of course  we will. All right. Opie and Anthony, we'll check the mousetraps next. Stay there. And  the Christmas. You're listening to Opie and Anthony. We got a very busy morning. Are 
[00:44:00]  you okay? I sneezed. I sneezed. This is where Wolf Mother got their sound, by the way.  You check out the Wolf Mother there, Jimmy? I like them. Yeah. You might like them.  They're a bit retro. Remind me of Zeppelin a little bit. Yeah, they were good.  A little Zeppelin, a little Sabbath, using the fuzzy, over-the-top guitars and the old 
[00:44:30]  school, like, organs. I like the Wolf Mother. I'm waiting for their second, you can't call  them albums anymore, right? Second, what do you call it? Their second digital release?  They still just call them, like, albums and records. It's stupid. It's one of those terms  like, um, I don't know, like Xerox or something. It's just kind of a thing. I don't know if  they'll, what do you call it? I don't know. Oh, I got a new album coming out. People say  albums. Yeah. Even though it's, an album literally just does mean a collection of, you know, your 
[00:45:00]  stuff. Sure. So you gotta, like, come up with a new term. What do you got on Wolf Mother  there, Travis? They broke up. What? Yes. Get the eff out of here. Yeah, like six months  ago. Why? Are you kidding me? No, I'm serious. What else are they gonna do? How stupid are  they? They broke up. They came on the scene and, and just took over the world. Why did  they break up? Uh, I don't remember why. I remember reading it on FMQB, like, six months  ago. Get the eff out of here. Get me info on that. I had no idea. I didn't either. What 
[00:45:30]  dopes. Wolf Mother had just an amazing debut. They just came from nowhere and just, just  exploded and they're, wow, who's the problem in that band? Who's the ass? Why'd you be the  keyboardist? Right. Or the tambourine player? Give me info on, I had no idea. It, it, it  figures. I get into a band and it's always the case. Yep. Gone. Everyone's saying they  broke up. I'm the last to know. Speaking of music, I was reading the paper today. Bruce 
[00:46:00]  Springsteen does that 12 minute dumb halftime thing, right? Yeah. Did you see what that did  for his record sales? All of a sudden everyone decided they're Bruce Springsteen fans. They  gotta buy the record. Isn't that amazing? How does that happen? It just is amazing. Like, I understand  with a band like all sudden, like, stupid news people. God damn it. Are they doing fake  earthquakes? Yes. There's a reporter standing there reporting on this faux earthquake that  happened in Jersey. It was a little shake, shake, shake. That was it. It doesn't happen  in Jersey. It's just ridiculous. Most people didn't even wake up. Yeah. And then they had 
[00:46:30]  a reporter on the scene and they started shaking the camera violently. So it like got my peripheral  vision. Those dopes. Dumpy news people. We get more respect than local news. How sad  is that? Local news stinks. Yeah, but I would kind of understand if it was a band that no  one really heard of and you can't say Super Bowl, but all of a sudden, you know, they get  a nice moment. Like, wow, I gotta check out this new band. They sound great. But a band 
[00:47:00]  like Springsteen that's been around forever, they played the halftime show and next thing  to know all these people are now Bruce Springsteen fans. That's weird to me. Where have you been?  Who is this young kid from Jersey? I gotta pick this record up. Well, it makes you think of  him. That's why. Because like when Tom Petty did it, I'm not a Tom Petty fan, but I know  who he is. Sure. And I heard, what is it, Running with a... Running Down a Dream.  Running Down a Dream, which is a great song. Maybe it's not cool to say it's a great song,  but it really is. It's a great song. It's a really good song. Just plug your nose. 
[00:47:30]  Running Down a Dream. Yeah. Him and Del Shannon were singing.  Running Down a Dream. So that was a great tune. I watched it on the Super Bowl.  I have to do like a refugee. What song is that? Just hold your nose. What song is that?  Refugee. Refugee. Tom Petty's. He's had some hits in his day. A few. I, of course, liked his  performance in The Postman. How can anyone not like this? No? 
[00:48:00]  Kevin Costner movie, The Postman, where he played the head of that town that was...  Yeah. All righty. So I heard this at the Super Bowl. Wait, me and Del were singing?  Yeah. That was cute.  And he committed suicide. And I got richer.  The Postman was nothing more than Waterworld on the land. Oh, yeah? Or vice versa, which 
[00:48:30]  all is just the road warrior. That's pretty much what The Postman was. They're asking on  a pal talk. They're promoting on Movies on Demand, that Kevin Costner film that was just  out. Yeah.  Where the presidential election is tied and it comes down to one vote. I would never sit through  that crap. Did they spend millions of dollars digitally putting hair on the back of his  head like they did in Waterworld? Did they really? Oh, my God, yeah. It's like, Kevin, 
[00:49:00]  why don't you go get one of those? Get a wig! Yeah, but it's Waterworld. Scary. Yeah, get a helmet.  Maury's wigs don't come off. Paint little locks on your helmet. Get a bathing cabin.  A bathing cabin. Take some hair to it. Paint curls so you look like Curly Sue. Look more real  than my wig, yeah. I'm 65 and I got a sandy blonde hair to it. Sandy blonde. I look like 
[00:49:30]  one of the San Andreas Beast Bombs. Your Al Pacino's amazing. Great. Really good.  We were watching, I was just in the office looking at a righteous kill because I wanted  to get a screen cap. Oh, and Pacino dies at the end, by the way. Of course he does.  And his death scene is so bad. The last thing he says is, I wish you continued success.  And I'm like, that couldn't be the end. He had to say something. He had to yell frunkus or 
[00:50:00]  something that they cut. But we were trying to find, like, screen caps of his little big  platform shoes. It's dark, but you can see. It looks like he's wearing Herman Munster's  shoes. You know what? Get it in, put it in Photoshop, F with the levels a little bit,  pump that up, find him shoes. We'll throw it up on onaradio.com. Let's get back to the Tom  Petty. So you see Running Down a Dream at the Super Bowl last year. I went on iTunes and I'm  like, I got to get that song. And I didn't buy a whole lot of his stuff, but I bought that  song. And it's like, Springsteen's a guy with a lot, to me, more recognizable songs 
[00:50:30]  of Tom Petty even. So you'll hear that and go, oh my God, I don't own glory days.  It's just weird, though. All of a sudden, everyone decides they like Springsteen because  of what they saw. I'll tell you why. And someone brings up the other one. The best example  of this was the Sopranos using Don't Stop Believing. And then all of a sudden, it was  the number one downloaded song on iTunes. And to this day, it's the number one downloaded  song on iTunes. And so many people didn't know that Don't Stop Believing is a pretty  cool journey song. That's weird to me.  What song is this? You forget that you don't have it. Like, that's all it is. And it's 
[00:51:00]  so immediate now. Ten years ago, you would have heard this and went, oh, that's cool.  I got to get that. And by tomorrow morning, you're like, you know what? You're absolutely  right, too, because there have been times I've been driving and I hear a song. I pull  out the old iPhone, hit the app that I got, put it by the speaker. It knows what song it  is. And I'm just I'm downloading the song. And it's a song that, like, I never would have  just thought of. It's happened just the other day with Bad Company, Silver, Blue and  Gold. I was listening to it. And I'm just like, like, you know, it's not a song I would 
[00:51:30]  ever go, oh, I got to get out and get that. But I'm listening to it. I realize I enjoy  it. Let me put it on. It's becoming easier to do things like that. It's just weird how  that works, though. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because, like, Don't Stop Believing has  been on the radio for 20 some odd years every effing day on the classic rock stations,  right? Mm hmm. But now all of a sudden people like liked it because it was in their favorite  TV show. Yeah. That's bizarre to me. That's all I'm saying. Do you think it might have something  to do with the fact that you don't have to go buy the album now? Yeah. You can just buy 
[00:52:00]  the song. Exactly. And the fact that you're on iTunes, it's not even really like you're  spending money. Yeah. You know, because you're just downloading it. You don't think that  it's being charged here. Just adds up after a while. And you're right there. It's  a buck. Exactly. A buck. If you looked at every song you have and realize you paid a  buck for each one. I don't need a lot of them. It's like, wow, I paid a lot of money. The  kids are spoiled today. We had to buy the albums, man. But it's 99 cents a clip and you're not  downloading, like, a lot every day. Like, once you get your initial collection of songs that 
[00:52:30]  you want, then, you know, in a couple of days you hear another song and you go, I'll get  that. It's a buck. Who cares? You know, it's like, you know, if you stop smoking, download  the songs, you're paying just as much. Getting back to Bad Company just quick. Yeah. Favorite  Bad Company song? Silver, Blue and Gold. Favorite? Yeah. I don't know one Bad Company song. I go  Shooting Star. Nah, that's too quick. I know it's commercial. Commercial. This is just, and  this isn't because, like, I don't like Bad Company for a lot of their rockin' songs or 
[00:53:00]  anything like this. You know, like, Bad Company, by Bad Company, off the album, Bad Company.  This is like, you know, this is a cool song. Starts mellow and then the hook is, uh, is  really cool. Do you like it? I don't know it. You'll probably know the chorus. Shooting  Star, I know. Don't you know? Yeah. I like it. This is kind of like, uh, more mellow. What's 
[00:53:30]  the singer's name? Um, wow. No clue. Who? What? No. No. I have no idea. Because he's got  a... Oh, we're getting to the hook here. Oh, it's Paul Hargis. Yeah, Paul Rogers. Oh,  yeah, Paul Rogers. Sure. Of course. We should have known that. Yeah, the hook's good, Ant.  Hey, what do you got on, uh, Wolf Mother there, Travis? Wait, is this the hook? Is  this the hook? Yeah, it just went by. I don't know the song. No? It's kind of an, it's not 
[00:54:00]  an obscure Bad Company song, but it's not one of their better known ones. Program directors  were scared to play this. Yeah. Some were brave enough to put it on the radio. This sounds  like the driving music, like, during a 1976, like, beach movie or whatever when they're driving.  I mean, this sounds like the montage music you listen to. It's kind of a nice... Montage.  I, uh, I liked those songs, too, though, where, like, um, you kind of, it brings you back 
[00:54:30]  to, um, you know, certain moments. There are certain songs that are just like, oh, yeah,  that was playing. It was like a soundtrack to your life movie, and, uh, certain songs are  playing, and you're just kind of like, oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Very cool. Hey,  what do you got on, Wolf Mother? Well, I'm here now. They're getting back together,  but the lead singer is recruiting new guys. Well, the lead singer is, yeah, the lead singer  is doing kind of like an Axl Rose thing, but, I mean, it's not really like that, because  they weren't as big as Guns N' Roses, but he's going to use the Wolf Mother name. But  I think Jim said, wouldn't it be funny if it was, like, the keyboard player? That's 
[00:55:00]  what it was. Okay, so the answer is no. The answer is no. It wasn't funny. No. Wait,  what was wrong with the keyboard? The keyboard player left the band after a festival, and then  the drummer decided he was going to leave, too. Wait, it was the keyboard player? Yeah. Why did  he decide to leave the band? I mean, the Wolf Mother sound is really cool, but the lead  singer is pretty recognizable as being Wolf Mother. Yeah, I don't think anybody really  knew who the guitar player for Wolf Mother was, you know? No. No. So, yeah, the keyboard  slash bass player left, and... You know how many bands are trying to make it, and you make 
[00:55:30]  it, and then you get stupid? A lot of people do that, yeah. What the hell's wrong with these  guys? Get some money together first. Get a bunch of records together. What dopes. The  Wolf Mother album was huge. Yeah, because you can't figure that they made that much off of  that album, because they were nobodies before that. Right, right. Yeah, they weren't able  to sign the big, huge record deal, probably, and it's one of the rare times where the whole  album is good. Don't you get killed on your first album, usually? Like, you just, until you 
[00:56:00]  have enough juice together. They say, sure. All right. Unfortunately, because we went  off-roading a little bit, we're going to have to wait with the Christian Bale. But  you promised it wasn't the keys. You know what? People are going to kill me, but I was  ready to go with this. Yeah, screw. And also, there was a phone call, and I'm hoping the  guy will call back. He saw the Pink Panther movie. He said, it's amazing how bad it is, and  I want to talk to that guy. I forgot his exact quote, but it was really good. He goes, it's 
[00:56:30]  amazing how horrendous this movie is. I'll tell you why. Because Steve Martin is very  out of touch. He doesn't realize that he's a thief, and that he's just been redoing  comedies. And as a comedian, when you're just redoing roles, you are stealing. This  one really bothers us as a show. This one makes me sick to my stomach. Because we're  old enough to remember the Peter Sellers' Pink Panther movies. They didn't need to be  fixed. They were great. We feel like we made it our own. No, you didn't, douche. You 
[00:57:00]  didn't make it your own. And it's not yours to make your own, you scumbag. God, is he  pompous. Be the funny white guy with Queen Latifah, you wig-wearing old whore. Shut up.  Is it a wig? I don't know. Either way, I'm saying it is. He might be one of the lucky  ones. Maybe he is. Here's Greg and DC. We'll go with this before the break. The Christian  Bell, you know. It'll stay. I wasn't even trying to tease. It's not perishable. It's  great. It's the big story today, I'm thinking. Greg, you saw the Pink 
[00:57:30]  Panther movie? I did, boys. And if you'd allow me to share my antidote with you  about it. Let's hope he's a mouse joke. It is incredibly awful. It is one of these movies  that Jimmy would watch and go, oh my God, I love this. This is the greatest movie ever  because they take Jean Reno, who is a French actor, an amazing French actor, and he has 
[00:58:00]  one of the worst French accents just to make Steve Martin's French accent sound believable.  Yeah, he's French, that guy. Yes, and they screw it up. And they also have Alfred Molina.  He has a bad British accent. Andy Garcia screws up an Italian accent that starts sounding Russian.  These guys. Another overactor, Andy Garcia. When a man loves a woman, did you see that when 
[00:58:30]  he got sober? That stupid movie? No. The movie is just horrible. I mean, I watched this. I'm  a middle school teacher, and I got free tickets. A bunch of the kids were there. Yeah, exactly.  Well, we could have him in one day. So all these kids are there, and people are laughing hysterically  at these terrible, terrible scenes. Steve Martin should be shot for what he did to Peter Sellers.  These are not Pink Panther. But the young, like, I call them demos, are laughing. They're 
[00:59:00]  enjoying this crap. Yeah, they are. And it was awful. The funniest part of the entire movie  for people who had half a brain, which was me and a buddy of mine who drank before we went.  There was one line Steve Martin had where he's talking about all the cats this girl that he  likes has. And one of the cats has the name Caligula. Oh, no. That was the funniest part  of the... Yeah, that's exactly how funny the movie is. Wow. Yeah. Fast Freddy's saying 
[00:59:30]  that he was on Letterman last night, this Steve Martin. It's a must-play video, so maybe  we can take a peek to see what that was all about.  If any of you have the time to buy it on the street, watch it. It is worth every douche chill  you will get to see this movie. Jimmy, let's go and see it so we can really talk about it  on the show. Jean Reno has never done a better role than the pedophile in The Professional.  Jesus Christ. You don't see that movie? No. Oh, is that who that is? Christ. Jean Reno didn't 
[01:00:00]  try to perform anything with her. She was the one trying to seduce him. Yeah, well, you watch  that movie. I don't care. He's looking at her. That's true. Well, hey, who wasn't? She's  hot. All right, Greg. Thank you. Her sexiest role.  Yeah, Greg's a 12-year-old. All right. Let's go to Jared in Boston. Jared on the moon.  Jared. Hey. Steve Martin was on SNL this weekend. You have to get some clips off of YouTube 
[01:00:30]  because it is biblically bad. He was biblically bad. That's great. Do you think he has a clue  that he's just hacking it up across all platforms right now? He used to be a good SNL host.  What I can't figure out is if he's now doing a goof on himself, and that's the bit. I don't  know. It was horrific. But is it a real goof? Is it like a silly, ironic thing, or is it  like really? Does he just come out dressed like a prostitute and say, this is what I now 
[01:01:00]  do for a living? That would have been funny compared to what was actually on TV.  All right. We've got to get the boys working on some Steve Martin clips. Just drag Peter  Sellers' rotting corpse onto the stage, and people will be laughing because they think  it's a prop, but actually have Peter Sellers' skeletal remains, and then he could just eat  off the ribs and bones and just devour him. This one just bugs us, man. This is a biggie  for us. I'm a big girl. I'm a big girl. What? A, it's not funny. B, it's stolen, man. You 
[01:01:30]  stole it, stupid. And I know it's like people are like, oh, it's a big deal. Maybe it's not  to people. All right, fine. You're just going to make a lot of money. They'll probably make  a hundred million dollars. What do I know? Bend a skeleton over and sodomize it. That would  be more dignified. More dignified. The clanking of those bones against the wall of the casket  while Steve pumped away with that bad black mustache and stupid white hair. You think 
[01:02:00]  he cries himself to sleep because he knows what he's doing? Nope, he doesn't care. Or  do you think he sleeps soundly? He's surrounded by a bunch of people who tell him he's a comic  genius, which he's not. He's a funny guy, but he's not. To me, he's just become irrelevant  because he doesn't know what a cornball he is. He was funny. It's it. All right, we  got to take a break. Christian Bell Audio next. We got to do this. Really? And we  also got to get a mousetrap update. We set the mousetraps. Our other studio, we work 
[01:02:30]  from two studios every day. The other studio was infested with mice. We learned that  yesterday. So we set electric mousetraps with our names on them, and we got a little  bet going. So we'll check in with the mousetraps next. He bags the mouse first. That's  right. Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. Oh, Jim Norton. Caroline's right. That's a couple days away now. I know.  I can't believe it's here. February 5th through 8th. This week, I'm in New York. 212-7-5-7-4-100.  Nice. I got one show on sale in Philly, which I got to plug up for Darby. Me and Artie Lang 
[01:03:00]  doing the Tower Theater. February 21st. But if you're in New York this weekend, that means  nothing to you. You can just come watch me at Caroline's. Very cool. And I'm doing a whole  new physical thing on stage now. Like a Jim Carrey type thing.  No, you're not. Shut up. I am. I do characters and stuff like that. It's very funny. Like  if somebody heckles me, I figure out this really funny thing. Like somebody, like yell,  you suck. You suck.  Alrighty then. It plays. You're going to go nuts.  You got to see that in an audience atmosphere. 
[01:03:30]  Ah, they go ballistic.  I bet.  Yeah. It's kind of crazy physical.  You do it like a song and dance number?  I do. I close. I tell everybody I kid because I love. It's a little song I wrote.  I kid because I love.  Chain in the top hat.  Yeah, I kid.  Oh, I would throw a tomato at your face.  They're handed out at the door.  You're supposed to make salad with them, but occasionally people get carried away and  throw them at my fat face.  Big thing of cabbage.  Yeah.  It's also part of it.  You're supposed to make cabbage hats. It's part of the fun at the end. Tomato salad  and cabbage hats. And we all laugh and do like a long chorus line thing. 
[01:04:00]  Can we make a cabbage hat on E-Rock, please?  Please.  I don't even know how we would get that done.  Oh, just hollow it out and put it on his head.  Yeah, a cabbage hat.  But it would have to be anchored down just to get just a windy day with something goopy.  E-Rock has a body like the Cabbage Patch Kid. That's what he looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Wow, he does.  With all this abuse, you would think he'd be anorexic by now.  No.  But he continues to use.  He goes the other way.  You don't give a crap.  You know what his cabbage patch name would be? Chubby O Worthless.  Wow, this guy doesn't like... 
[01:04:30]  I don't believe it. Not me.  He doesn't like you, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  We'll get to his call in a second, but we promised a...  And if we don't get to this Christian Bale audio, look.  Oh, my God.  Look. It has to happen during this segment.  Mars is on the phone with a mouse update.  Our other studio infested with mice to the point where one bumped into Danny the other day.  The guys are working and they...  That sounds like he was walking into the office and like, oh, excuse me.  Yeah, but it's a little mouse briefcase.  And guys have seen them like scurry across the counters as they're trying to cut up audio and stuff. 
[01:05:00]  It's a real, real problem.  So we're trying to see who could catch a mouse first today.  We got an electric trap set at the other place.  And Mars is over there.  Let's get an update.  Mars, what do you got, man?  Good morning, guys.  Hi.  Nothing dead yet, but certainly we had three sightings so far.  Three sightings?  Yes, three sightings.  Um, by, especially by, uh, the area, the, uh, that, um, Travis works on the Dillette. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  By the cleaners.  Yeah.  That, uh, we saw, I saw one there and, um, Heaven saw one by Buddy's area.  Ooh, there's a mouse set, a mousetrap set in your buddy's area.  Right.  He's the hoarder, by the way, that we have to work with.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You guys got other primo spots except one.  The primo spot also is, uh, where Danny felt the mouse run over his toes.  Yeah.  That's a good spot there.  So, if you don't mind, uh, we're going to have the interns, uh, also set up a, one of 
[01:06:00]  the simple traps.  Okay.  And we'll, we'll beat you.  Well, they want to beat you with their simple trap.  A snap trap, one of those.  And these electric traps are definitely set, right?  We watch the light go on and off.  Absolutely, buddy.  All right.  Uh, as soon as we catch one, please call the show there, Mars.  Absolutely, guys.  No problem.  All right, Mars.  We love Mars.  We don't get him on the radio often, but he's a, he's a good man.  Yeah, he's terrible on the air, but.  Yeah.  Uh, Rich in Georgia. 
[01:06:30]  Rich.  Hey, how y'all doing?  Listen, I don't like Jimmy.  I love Jimmy.  Thank you.  But I have to say that, uh, you know, if you look at Steve Martin, what he's been doing  his entire career, I'm 40, so I grew up with the stupid, wild, and crazy guy, but era  through the head.  But he's been doing that same character his entire career, it's just this time it has  a sorry French accent, and yes, I love Peter Sellers, too.  And I love sausages. 
[01:07:00]  Dude, hold on.  I don't disagree with you.  Like, stuff like The Jerk and The Man With Two, there's a lot of funny stuff he did, and  people do at times remake comedies, which I still find is unnecessary, but this one bothers  me so much, because Sellers was so defined as Clouseau, it was so completely him, and  then there's just something that really bothers me.  Like, there's other ones, like Father of the Bride, I don't associate that so strongly with  one guy.  Yeah, because they're original characters, and he's doing his own thing, and you love it  or hate it, at least he's, you know, trying something. 
[01:07:30]  But to try to make something that was just a classic, and people forgot that it was a  classic, that's, it's sad.  It's sad for Peter Sellers' family that this is going on.  Because Peter Sellers wasn't corny or muggy, I mean, he was like, he was deadpan, like he  really was this guy.  Yeah, he played it off like he was really this guy, yeah.  And there was no wink about, hey, look what I'm doing, hamburger.  There was none of that crap, that's how he really talked.  And he's making a mockery of what Peter Sellers created. 
[01:08:00]  Right, and I understand that, but the thing is, is when your target audience is 5-year-olds  to 12-year-olds, you have to be corny and goofy.  It's not like he's trying to be edgy.  No, no, he's not, and I'm not saying you have to be edgy to be funny.  I just, I don't like the fact that he is just, he's stalling this role, and I'm going  to keep trashing him for it.  But look, I'm not saying I don't, I never liked Steve Martin.  He's done a lot of really funny, I thought all of me with Lily Tomlin was hilarious,  the jerk, he's done a lot of funny stuff.  I like the jerk.  Yeah, I think it starts there and ends there with me. 
[01:08:30]  I'm really trying to think.  I mean, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, I love that movie, but I mean, anyone could have  done the Steve Martin character in that movie.  Well, I love you guys.  All right, Rich, thank you.  Yeah, it's cool, you got your opinion, it's all good.  It'll make $100 million, too.  No kidding, and that's going to enrage you.  Of course it will.  Skydiver survives when his tandem instructor died during a jump.  Wow.  This just in.  We're going to try to get more on that in a few minutes. 
[01:09:00]  But first, if we don't play the Christian Bale audio, they're not going to be happy out  there in Radio Land.  Christian Bale, this audio is making the rounds.  We got a crystal clear copy of this.  He's on the set of what, Terminator, Ant?  Is it a TV show or a movie?  Movie.  A movie, and they're redoing Terminator.  Yeah.  Well, not really.  I know, they're doing a...  It's pretty much a prequel.  The future.  No, it's the war with the machines.  It's the war.  Okay.  It's after the machines have become weird. 
[01:09:30]  What about the Gobernator?  It sounds like a pretty good premise, but, you know, I'm sure he'll talk like this.  Oh, he does.  I don't know when he started to suck, but, boy, when he jumped in and sucked him with  both feet.  Hey.  You see they're making...  Is he playing John Connor in that?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  You see they're making a G.I. Joe movie?  Yeah.  I saw that during the Super Bowl, Mike.  I know, I'm hoping to get promotional money just walking around in my regular clothes. 
[01:10:00]  I see that.  I was a civilian yesterday.  I saw that.  It was weird.  Like you were a regular guy.  Yeah.  Today I'm back to being Sandinista.  Very good.  They're just comfy clothes.  I hear you.  5'11".  I'm a sweat guy.  I need more sweatpants.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah.  You are a sweatpants guy.  Oh, yeah.  And Jimmy's just a casual Jimmy.  I'm Jimmy Jeans.  That was my nickname in high school.  In fact, you don't want to call me Jimmy Jeans after repeated discussions in the office.  This is just kind of bothering me now. 
[01:10:30]  I said it's Jimmy Jeans or it's nothing.  I thought it was Christian Jimmy.  I can't keep up with this.  It's not all about Christianity.  We all know who he is.  Praise his name.  But my name is Jimmy Jeans.  Jimmy Jeans.  Why do you think I like Christian Bale?  I love his name.  Praise it.  Oh, well.  Christian Bale.  That's right.  That's right.  I got you.  Praise the name.  Well, Kent the movie guy, he's been waiting for this moment.  So he knows why Christian Bale freaked out.  So we'll let Kent the movie guy set this up.  Go ahead, Kent. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, so they were filming the most emotional scene, probably the only one in the entire film.  Yeah.  And their director of photography is this guy named Shane Hurlbutt.  And he's pretty inexperienced.  He hasn't shot very many action films and basically wasn't in the scene or in the shot, but was just in Christian Bale's point of view.  Oh, boy.  And, yeah, like behind, he was filming a scene with Bryce Dallas Howard, and he was right behind her staring at lights and messing with lights. 
[01:11:30]  And that's basically what set Bale off.  He hasn't been able to do, like, a dramatic role for a long time.  So now that he gets to do something where he emotes a little bit, this guy comes in and just starts trompling around with the lights and everything.  And that's basically what set Bale off.  He was distracted.  You know, and I could relate.  Back at AAF, I remember when we were trying to create, as we all know by now, if you linger longer, we are artists creating on a daily basis. 
[01:12:00]  Yes, and we had some creation we were in the middle of up there, and then we had the fat guy, the engineer, I forgot his name, Eric.  I liked Eric.  Eric, yeah.  With the drill.  He was drilling and hammering.  As we're trying to do our radio show.  Yeah, he's drilling and hammering.  It's like there's construction going on as we're trying to do a show.  But, you know, we're professional.  We're raw as above.  Yeah.  All right, so let's get to the Christian Bale audio. 
[01:12:30]  Here's him just losing his mind.  I want you off the f***ing set, you prick.  I'm sorry.  Now, don't just be sorry.  Think for one f***ing second.  What the f*** are you doing?  Are you professional or not?  Yes, I am.  Do I f***ing walk around and rip that?  No, shut the f*** up, Bruce.  Do I what?  No.  No.  Don't shut me up.  Am I going to walk around and rip your f***ing lights down in the middle of a scene? 
[01:13:00]  Then why the f*** are you walking right through?  Oh, da-da-da-da, I like this in the background.  What the f*** is it with you?  He's fantastic.  I love him.  Yeah, it's amazing.  Like, I hate to say I'm kind of side with Christian Bale when you're doing something like that in some dumbbell.  Not that I know what it's like to act like that.  I never did anything more than, shut up, Lou.  But I can imagine you get yourself in this headspace to do something.  You know, people wonder, how do they do so well on film? 
[01:13:30]  How do they make you believe it?  It's like when you finally get into that place to do it and some ass just yucks us through.  I don't care if he's right or wrong.  Yeah.  I just love anyone that can get this angry and curse like this.  This is me.  I love listening to this.  You know, I don't do it in the workplace.  That's open.  No.  That's true.  You do it when certain people move into the neighborhood.  Right.  Property values. 
[01:14:00]  What the f*** are you doing selling to a f***?  That's the house next door to me, you f*** lover.  That's what all the Jews said to whoever sold you the house.  Andrew.  You really think you bring up the property value, mafia boy?  Right.  Very good, Jimmy.  The only non-Jew in the neighborhood.  Oh, boy, you're a disgrace.  They're sitting right there in front of me.  I just had my Christmas lights taken down last week. 
[01:14:30]  Boy, were they angry.  How belligerent are you?  Santa Claus in July?  That constant reminder of their crime against him.  You know, you kid, but if I could have a couple of minutes here.  Oh, Chris and Jimmy?  Yes, of course.  Or Jimmy Jeans.  You know, it is that Christ came to them.  Praise his name.  Let's get back to the Christian Bale audio.  Two Jews walk into a bar, and that bar was called Damnation. 
[01:15:00]  Praise his name.  Wow.  No, I don't want to do this, Chris and Jimmy.  Of course.  We've got to get the Bale audio on.  Yes.  It continues.  Oh, there's more.  There's more.  Oh, my God.  20 more.  Don't worry.  That's just the beginning.  You got any f***ing idea about, hey, it's f***ing distracting having somebody walking  up behind Bryce in the middle of the f***ing scene?  Give me a f***ing answer.  What don't you get about it?  I was looking at the light.  Oh, good for you. 
[01:15:30]  And how was it?  I hope it was f***ing good because it's useless now, isn't it?  F***ing Jake, man, you're amateur.  Wow.  He's hot under the collar.  When are you going to put the Christian Bale audio?  Hey, I'm out.  I thought that was you to Travis the other day.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:16:00]  Come on, everybody.  Oh.  Relax.  Oh.  Present your heart to this guy.  What?  Oh.  Wait, what kind of...  I wonder, now here's what I wonder, like, was he really this angry?  Does he need this to kind of stay in character?  Like, uh...  Like...  Either way, you're a psychopath.  Yeah.  Either way, you're a psychopath.  Listen to this guy.  In the middle of the scene, he does walk up while they're shooting.  He walks in his sight, lights in.  Yeah, in his line of sight.  It's hard enough, like, when I would have to emote. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, yes, Jimmy.  Like, I would have to be angry or creepy.  It's so hard, because you have lights around you and a camera anyway.  It's completely un...  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Do you know that was a 75-take thing?  The first time I did it on Spider-Man, they're like...  Actually, I was like, he stinks, and I don't like him.  They're like, no, it's not a musical.  That'll work.  He stinks, and I don't like...  They're like, enough with the Ethel Merman.  I'm like, I have to tribute her.  More Christian Bale on set, losing his mind. 
[01:17:00]  Look, G, you got something to say to this prick?  I didn't see it happen.  Well, somebody should be watching and keeping an eye on him.  Fair enough.  This is the second time that he doesn't give a...  About what is going on in front of the camera.  Oh.  All right?  I'm trying to do a scene here, and I'm going,  Why the f*** is Shane walking in there?  What is he doing there?  Do you understand my mind is not in the scene if you're doing that?  Stay off the f***ing set, man. 
[01:17:30]  For f***ing sake.  Wow.  That was the second time they've done that.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  He just said it.  Yeah, this is the second time.  Two times.  That's what you got.  You son of a b***h.  Get off.  I'm going to f***ing kick your f***ing ass.  You know, shut up for a second, all right?  I'm going to go.  Do you want me to go f***ing trash your lights?  Do you want me to f***ing trash them?  Then why are you trashing my scene?  I'm not trying to be trash.  You are trashing my scene.  You do it one more f***ing time, and I ain't walking on this set if you're still hired. 
[01:18:00]  I'm f***ing serious.  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  But I don't f***ing cut it when you f***ing the f*** around like this on set.  Let's get Tom and put this back on.  Let's go again.  Seriously, man.  You and me, we're f***ing done professionally.  F***ing ass.  Wow.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the noobs?  That's a good one, huh?  This is Phil Collins. 
[01:18:30]  You're doing to this scene what I did to the Batman character.  You're ruining it.  Tony in Jersey.  Tony!  Tony, let's go.  Yo.  We're having a good one today, Tony.  He's on the air.  He's probably hoping that I'll yell, but I'm not.  That's right.  Oh.  Yeah, well, take a phone call, and you don't even answer the bloody thing.  What the f***'s wrong with you?  You're ruining the show. 
[01:19:00]  We've got a call lines up, and you can't even f***ing take the call.  Your name is up there.  I said your f***ing name, and you don't.  What's the matter with you?  I'm not going to do a f***ing show with these phones.  Steve, get in here.  How many times have I told you I need this audio?  You've never told me that, but you knew I was thinking it.  All right.  You're f***ing f***ing it.  All right, I get it.  They're not f***ing it.  Pendulum was crap. 
[01:19:30]  Ann taught me that less than a few months ago.  I've, you know, I've changed.  And it's like, you know, I've got to tell you, these guys aren't psychic.  I know.  I remember that conversation.  I'm like, oh, oops.  Jason, Virginia.  Travis, you hand out one f***ing piece of paper when I'm trying to do a f***ing live read.  I disgust that.  You're f***ing distracting me.  Oh.  Oh, wait, he's relaxing.  I disgust it. 
[01:20:00]  I didn't yell at that one.  And here's an opie's house.  Stop picking your f***ing nose.  How does Lindsay sound like that?  She doesn't.  That was him in the mirror.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  She just sat in the living room covering her ears like Matthew Modine in full metal jacket going,  I've married a psychopath.  Help me.  Oh.  Let's go to Jason in Virginia Beach.  Barrel time.  What's up, boy?  Yeah, what's up, Jason?  Hey, you're all calling him a psychopath, but Ant's walking around in fatigue, and you're 
[01:20:30]  smashing CD players every other day, so go figure.  Crazy.  I did kick a CD player the other day.  Oh.  Oh.  It's my urban warfare attire.  Oh, my gosh.  That a boy.  Now, Mike might have a little more info on this clip.  Mike in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mikey.  Is there any doubt that this guy did not beat the crap out of his mother and sister  when he was in London a few months ago?  Yeah, but who knows?  She might have talked at the wrong time. 
[01:21:00]  I like this Christian Bale guy.  You're right, Ant.  I turned the corner on him.  Come on, Mom.  But is this an old...  You're a bloody...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Way to beat the wrong one.  Wow.  Wow.  It was also a perfect adjective for...  You know, it's one of those...  Yes, of course it was.  Maybe it was just...  You know, maybe she was cranky.  Exactly.  Now, was this done before he had a problem with his mom and sister?  Is this an old clip?  Nah, this has to be relatively new. 
[01:21:30]  Maybe it just is finally getting out there.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Oh!  Black History Month.  Has it gone?  Speaking of which, Flavor Flav's on Fox and Friends.  And I don't know what is on his upper lip, but he looks like he rubbed Vaseline on his face.  Yeah, yeah.  He really has Coke sweats.  Coke sweats.  Yeah, something's going on there.  What is that?  I don't know.  He looks like Nixon during the JFK debate.  What is he doing?  He's got...  Yeah, there's something going on.  He's just really sweaty, man. 
[01:22:00]  He might have just come from Frederica Bimmel's autopsy.  Yo, man, they look to you.  It matters.  Y'all got to leave the room.  I'll take care of her now.  Yeah!  Yeah, fatso!  Oh, Frederico is a fat pig.  Stupid diamond cuts in your back. 
[01:22:30]  Pig.  She's like, I met this boy, and he's like, he's talking to me.  The next thing he was carving a dress out of her skin.  Of course.  Oh, what a stupid fat thinks they're sexy pictures in her music box.  Yeah.  Oh, how uncomfortable is she looking in those giant panties?  Terrible.  The fat girl finally has the attention of a boy.  Scrapped to those pictures.  Oh.  And then, yeah, didn't she leave him there for the father to find?  No, yeah, I know that they were tucked away, and Jodie Foster just knew where to look.  Yeah, they were in, like, the back of the music box. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  And she pulled the thing off, takes the pictures out, looks at them, and it's Frederica Bimmel's  fat body in underwear, and then she just leaves the pictures there for the poor father to find.  He probably took them.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  It's Black History Month.  We started this yesterday.  We're going to feature somebody every day on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  She'll probably try to eat that moth who's hungry.  It wasn't even planted there.  Or, no, there was so much peanut butter and stuff logs in her throat that the moth flew in behind a raccoon and a badger 
[01:23:30]  to get all the food in her palate.  They chrysalis or pupa.  Pupa.  What?  You guys know that, you know, during the show, I'm browsing what you guys are talking about all the time, right?  So I just threw Frederica Bimmel into a Google image search.  On the second row, there's a copy of Jim Norton's Happy Endings book.  Oh, I see that.  Look at that.  And if you go down a little further, there's actually an O.P. and Anthony picture of all three of you guys.  So that's how much notoriety Frederica Bimmel has gotten in this program. 
[01:24:00]  You guys are pretty much now synonymous with that.  Of course.  We should be.  We should be at this point.  I love the fact that in the Silence of the Lambs after when they show Hannibal, the prequel, he's even fatter,  which I guess is great.  I went on Atkins after Migs threw something in my mouth.  The chrysalis or a pupa, right?  God, it's you mysterious.  Shut up.  Idiot.  Where's Fats the Puppets, stupid?  You're mysterious. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Black History Month.  We're going to feature another fine African-American today.  Yes.  To celebrate Black History Month, the O.P. and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic African-Americans  without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor State Representative Alvin A. Holmes from Montgomery, Alabama,  whose diction, vocabulary, and public speaking ability have set a benchmark for black politicians for years to come. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, what's wrong with the bill we got?  I mean, the bill we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the bill we have.  It drank pretty good.  Well said, push mouth.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history.  I always named some of them other bills.  Buckwiles and what else?  No.  That's funny.  O.P. and Anthony, you never know who's going to stop on by. 
[01:25:30]  Joe DeRosa in studio.  You got what, a Comedy Central special?  Yeah, Friday night at 10.30.  Very cool.  Is that your first?  My first.  Congrats, my friend.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, man.  You're moving on up.  Trying.  Finally.  Trying.  I'm going to up this $27,000 a year salary.  30.  Yeah.  30 by next year.  You're going to be an overnight sensation, even though you've been at it, what?  Seven long years.  Yeah, I love when they do that.  Wow, he's an overnight sensation.  No, these guys have been working on this for many, many years, finally getting a break. 
[01:26:00]  Joe should get a break.  Thank you, man.  I appreciate it.  Hey, there's a story.  Story?  That is just hitting the wire.  A skydiver.  Wow.  Skydive horror for newbie as instructor dies mid-jump.  Yeah, you get these tandem jumpers.  You're pretty much strapped on the front of the skydiver.  And he jumps out of the plane and does everything.  You get to enjoy the ride down, but you don't have to do anything.  Yeah.  Well, listen to this.  Yeah.  Just imagine the horror. 
[01:26:30]  A rookie skydiver on his first ever jump.  And last.  Had to glide himself to safety after his instructor died of a heart attack as they parachuted from  a few thousand feet up.  Wow.  On the way down, guy dies.  You're still strapped to him.  And you don't really know what the F you're doing because you're going with the guy.  And now you've got to figure this out.  All right.  The guy had pulled the chute, though, before he died.  I don't know.  That's kind of what I'm.  Let's see.  Daniel Farr, 25, who was strapped to the doomed teacher, managed to grab control of the chute 
[01:27:00]  and steer his way to landing in a South Carolina field.  So that makes it sound like maybe the chute was already.  The chute was open.  Yeah.  And he had to pull on the old handles.  Farr tried to give CPR to stricken instructor George Chip Steele.  George Chip Steele, 49.  But it was too late.  The drop zone drama unfolded Saturday when Farr went to a skydiving facility for the jump.  A Christmas gift from his girlfriend.  Hey.  You know, those gifts are the dumbest things you could do. 
[01:27:30]  Like, hey, I gave you a gift of bungee jumping.  I gave you the gift of skydiving.  It was the gift of base jumping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of those things where I won't mind that much if you die.  Yeah.  I bought you flying through the air with a corpse strapped to your back for your birthday.  You know what, though?  You've got a story.  The guy's got a story for the rest of his life.  He's the guy.  Is this a really dumb question?  I'm amazed.  How did they know that he died in the air and not? 
[01:28:00]  Is that really a dumb question?  Well, he was alive when they jumped out of the plane.  And he's dead when they were on the ground.  Right.  But I mean.  Somewhere in between there, Joe.  Could an impact or something.  Somewhere.  Somewhere.  All right.  It was a dumb question.  The last thing he said.  I know this.  It was the guy.  They jumped and the guy asked a question.  And he goes, wow, it's really quiet up here.  And the instructor said, welcome to my world.  And that was the last thing he said.  No, for real.  That's what happened.  The last thing he said.  Because people don't realize when you jump out of a plane, it's really eerily quiet as 
[01:28:30]  you're plummeting to the earth.  Is that true?  He said, welcome to my world.  Welcome to my world.  That was his last word.  Well, and goodbye from mine was his answer.  A few seconds passed and far asked his instructor another question.  This time, Steele didn't answer.  Now he's a dead guy.  Wow, that was quick.  Now he's a dead guy.  And I'm sure they'll be like, he died doing what he loved doing.  Being strapped to a man.  He hated skydiving, but he loved ass rape. 
[01:29:00]  What a great excuse to be very close to men.  Yes.  Run to back like that?  Like a Cialis and jump.  I love that, though, because it's just a way to make us all feel better.  He died doing what he loved.  Doing what he loved doing.  They said that about my principal.  He died scuba diving out east on Long Island.  Torn apart by a shark.  Like, he died doing what he wanted to do.  Beef, fish, food.  I think he had like a heart attack 100 feet down. 
[01:29:30]  You've got to think that's a horrific death.  And that's how they spun it to us, little kids.  He died doing what he loved doing.  And I remember as a kid even thinking, wow, that's a horrific way to go.  Yeah.  Underwater like that.  That's horrible.  Jesus Christ.  There's nothing fun about it.  How old was he?  Wow.  You know, when you're a kid, the guy could have been 40.  But in my little kid mind, he looked like he was 60.  70.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I have no idea.  You know when you die doing what you love when J-Lo mistakes your face for a bike seat and you drop dead? 
[01:30:00]  That's a fair time to say you died doing what you love.  So he asked another question and the instructor did not answer.  J-Lo joke, by the way.  Good one.  It was nice.  Realizing something was amiss, Farr grabbed a steering device and tried to avoid trees in a house.  He landed in a field and tried to help steal until paramedics arrived.  Even after the terrifying adventure, Farr said what?  Said what, Ant?  I'll still go skydiving.  Give yourself a nice little bell for the correct answer, my friend.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  That is, uh, that's, that's, the guy's got a good story, though.  If you know you're going to survive that, I would take that deal.  What the hell?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  It's your life a little more interesting that you survive something like that.  Dead guy on your back?  You could never, you know, I don't know.  He can never tell the story on anything, though, because he's always, he's too close to the incident  and he's always got to worry about that guy's family getting upset because he's bragging.  He's bragging that he went to the air with a dead guy strapped.  I'd say I didn't even need him.  Yeah.  I cut him loose, actually. 
[01:31:00]  He plummeted.  Yeah.  And I realized he was just dead weight.  Yeah.  I knew I was a pro.  I knew I could do this on my own.  I could steer a chute.  That sucks.  You think he had dead guy breath just trying to land this?  No, because you're dead.  There's nothing coming out.  Well, it starts, it starts, well, you know what I mean.  It starts with the rotting process.  The mouth might smell a little bit.  The mouth starts getting dry immediately.  It's just the trip down.  It's not like rigor is setting in.  I was going to say, how fast does rigor more set in?  Do you think I'm...  Jim C?  By the time he hit the ground, they know he was dead, Sam. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, Jim C.  It was an accident.  Yeah.  It was a tragedy.  Yes.  He had botulism from the plain water.  Oh, wow.  That's a bold statement.  I thought he just had a heart attack on the way down.  I have little skinny teeth.  Yeah.  Do you empty your bowels as soon as you die?  So that could have been a problem, too.  Oh, that might have happened. 
[01:32:00]  That's nice.  I'm still going with the bad smell thing.  There's got to be something going on.  There's...  Yeah.  Hey, you watched the Super Bowl there, Joe?  I didn't.  I was on a frigging plane the whole time.  You missed one of the greatest games in Super Bowl history.  If I cared at all about sports, I'd be upset right now.  You're not a sports guy.  I'm not a sports guy at all.  Look at me.  I'm a mess.  You're perfect for watching sports.  I can't even play sports on Xbox.  It's embarrassing.  Now, was it a good game?  Yeah, it really was.  Apparently, this name is the best Super Bowl ever. 
[01:32:30]  In the third quarter, bud.  Yeah, they are.  But it wasn't.  Well, that's what they're saying.  I don't know.  It's right up there.  They are.  There were some amazing plays.  And then they win because the guy's good with his tippy toes.  It's a great ending.  Yeah.  That's something that I see as being relatively new to football.  Being able to do that tippy-toe thing.  Like, years ago, they'd just stumble into the end zone, look to catch the ball.  There, he's out of bounds.  Like, they've got to practice that move. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  They've got to, like, throw the ball at him right at the out-of-bounds line in the end zone  and go, no, you've got to keep those toes in there.  Yeah.  That isn't just something you kind of think of off the cuff.  Plant the toes.  Let me do this move where I defy gravity and catch a ball.  Yeah.  And they're running.  They're running.  Full speed.  My ankles would snap right off of my body.  I dropped the ball because I got one of those cramps from putting your foot too far down too fast.  And you're cramps. 
[01:33:30]  Ow!  Ow!  I got a cramp.  And you're cramps.  Yeah, right on the arch of your foot.  Ah!  I'd be pulling my foot up crying with the ref waving.  It was incomplete.  Everyone hating me.  I get those in bed all the time.  Oh!  And it's so embarrassing when I have a girl.  In the middle of the night, right?  Yeah, when I have a girl over that I don't know.  She's laying there and I'm going, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  I got a cramp.  Wait a minute.  I got a cramp.  And you're pulling on your foot and your leg and they're getting dressed.  You ever get it so bad you watch the muscle go up your leg and you're like holding with two hands in place praying that it's not going to move any further? 
[01:34:00]  No.  You've never got one of those?  Oh!  Well, you know, maybe that's...  You watch the whole calf muscle start moving up.  Oh!  For the back of your knee.  That's hard.  I've never seen anything move like an alien in there.  And you feel it moving like there's something alive in there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe that's happened, but I haven't seen it.  I'm going to look for it next time.  I can feel when a cramp is ready.  It's like it's ready to start cramping up and you're like, uh-oh, if I move my leg a certain way, I'm doomed.  And then you're laying in bed just going, all right, stay like, no, no, that's bad. 
[01:34:30]  The best one is...  And then it just squeezes.  The best one is watching your toes try to escape from your body.  And you look at it like, what are they doing?  And your muscle wants oxygen.  But also, they just start moving in directions they're not supposed to move in.  And I'm so...  I was just going to say, I'm so loud when I get them.  And I get them at like 6 a.m.  And I'm in my bed like, F, C, F.  You know, like just my neighbors must be like, what is he?  Is he murdering somebody in there right now? 
[01:35:00]  Like just, oh, it's the worst.  It is, yeah, embarrassing.  I asked her about the Super Bowl just to set up a clip.  Oh.  In Arizona, they're doing the Super Bowl thing.  And somewhere in the middle of the game, a porn clip pops on the TV.  Really?  Yeah.  Someone had a little shenanigans down at the old relay station.  Danny, what do we got?  This isn't the news story.  This is the actual porn clip popping on?  This audio is from somebody's actual DVR. 
[01:35:30]  You'll notice that the audio quality, it's okay, it's a little tinny,  but that's because somebody was like videotaping their television.  So this is off their DVR exactly how it aired.  And this is real?  Yeah.  This is some guy trying to do it now?  No, this looks like the real thing.  All right, here we go.  Maybe somewhere on this crime, we ought to go back to that.  But I got those safeties beep again.  Is that it?  Is that it?  It's in the same way.  It's going to go. 
[01:36:00]  It's still in the same territory.  30, 20, 10.  Arizona has the lead.  Hi, but you know.  If he starts bothering you a little bit, just slap his **** over his pants.  Just give it a little crack.  Ken, it's lodged. 
[01:36:30]  It's lodged in there.  Hold on, let me get it down for you.  There you go.  Did you shake a little air into it?  Okay, you can...  And he went through the perfect guy in the prison.  No way.  No way.  I bet you're somewhere someone is furious that a football game interrupted the porn.  Yes, excuse me.  I'm lodged in the porno, and...  You think someone's calling the cable company?  My porn was interrupted by some dumb game?  That's hilarious. 
[01:37:00]  I was hoping that it was going to come in right at the touchdown.  Ten!  Yeah.  Eight!  Pull it out of his pants.  Now, people, because of this radio show, think that's our bit.  This really happened.  I just want to stress that.  Where did that come from?  In Arizona.  Oh, my God.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  The video.  How do we turn people on to this video?  This video is located on a website called Fleshbot.com.  Ah.  Are we allowed to say Fleshbot?  Oh, and there it is.  It's just switched to the porno portion.  Right. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, porno.  Imagine sitting watching the game, and then it's like, wait, what is...  Is this a commercial?  Is this one of the wacky commercials?  Do they show a pop-out?  Yes, they do, James.  Oh, good.  Just give it a sec.  And...  Oh.  Here we go.  Is this for Doritos?  What commercial is this?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  Is this the new Transformers TV spot?  Yeah.  You said they were going to play.  What is that?  That audio translated into the clip that we did.  Wow.  And then back to the game.  Yeah, the slapping you heard was him, like, doing a hula hoop type motion, and it was something 
[01:38:00]  slapping against his thighs.  Yeah, side to side.  Yeah, is what you heard.  Is that a...  Are people mad when they're watching the game and that happens?  I would love that.  Yeah, it would be great.  I'd laugh my ass off.  I want to know more about this, because this is brilliant for maybe a website or something.  You get into cahoots with the guy at the TV station and go, look, let's do this.  There's no upside, though. 
[01:38:30]  There's really no upside.  What if the guy's making, like, no money, and this website, let's say, gets to him and  goes, look, you've got to put this clip on right in the middle of the game.  We'll get national exposure.  I'll give you 100 Gs.  That's an interference.  There's, like, something really illegal about it.  Yeah, I was going to say.  Yeah.  An FCC violation, I'm sure.  And by the way, how about this porn actor?  From just doing a regular porn movie, and all of a sudden, your penis is on television  during the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Well, this guy's name is Evan Stone.  That's Evan Stone.  That is Evan Stone. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, look at you.  Evan Stone.  Did you recognize him?  Did you recognize him?  By the way, the picture's from the hips up.  I mean, down.  Damn it.  Ah-ha, hips up.  I always get that back.  I'm a dyslexic idiot.  No, when he stands up, you can see he's got the hair.  In the beginning, you can see his hair and his face.  That is Evan Stone.  Yeah.  Okay.  I thought you recognized him.  This was actually, I guess, there's a Club Jenna channel on whatever service provider is out  there in Arizona, and this was what, I guess, was playing at the time.  Ah, some signals got crossed there, huh?  Yes, it's on.  Wait, let me jump in. 
[01:39:30]  We got Tony.  He's a cop in Arizona.  Tony.  How you doing?  Good.  What do you got on this?  Hey, I'm a police officer in Arizona where this happened, and it was only Comcast cable  and with only the non-HD feed, but the police departments got inundated with phone calls  with people demanding that people be arrested over this because their children saw it.  Wasting 911 time.  Because what are the cops going to do?  There's porn on my TV.  All right.  Well, come in and shoot your television. 
[01:40:00]  It's the Janet Jackson thing.  Yeah.  It was nothing, huh?  Yeah.  First, it was Janet.  Now, it's some guy's penis.  This was only a local thing.  Imagine if it wasn't local, though, and that went out all over everyone that was watching  the Super Bowl.  That's what I thought he meant at first, and I was like, oh, now I wish I would have watched  the game.  Women calling, demanding that that penis replace their husbands.  I was like, officer, could you shoot my husbands and find that gentleman?  Wow.  Good boy, Evan.  Jesus God.  Hey, we can get this done.  Eric, I'm not even going to say where you're from, but you work in TV, and if someone offered 
[01:40:30]  you money, you would do this, right?  Yeah.  If someone offered me enough money, I would definitely.  I barely make anything.  And this is easy to do, right?  It would be very easy.  Wow.  It depends.  If you're in match control, it's the slip of a finger.  If you're in tape, you just pop in another tape.  I'm telling you, I'm surprised this hasn't happened more.  You get some guys that make no money, and you go, hey, let's do this thing.  It's happened by accident.  There was a guy at the CBC, his foot slipped, and he punched up porn. 
[01:41:00]  No, why?  Because these guys are watching porn.  They're bored.  They're in the control room.  They have to be the guy that has to work Super Bowl Sunday, so they got something else on  one of the monitors, and all of a sudden, yeah, you hit the wrong switch by action, and  then there you go.  Everyone's checking out what you're watching.  I worked in TV before comedy.  I don't think it's that easy to do, man.  A control room sometimes has several people in it.  If it was that easy, like you just said, why wouldn't people be pulling this?  Why hasn't this happened before? 
[01:41:30]  It's all in your position.  If you can do it and not get caught, I worked with 10 other people.  They wouldn't know who did it.  I had to tell the other guys, hey, I got it.  Why don't you guys take a break?  I'll watch the control room for the next hour.  That photo is depressing me, by the way.  It's a still photo of her sitting there, and Evan is standing up, and you can only see him  from the waist down, and he's not even.  He's completely in I-just-woke-up state.  He's not ready to have sex.  And it still dwarfs me when I am ready, and it's depressing.  Yeah, he's just kind of like, just, yeah, it's like he just woke up, and it's a behemoth. 
[01:42:00]  When I look at that photo, I just think, it's amazing.  I automatically think that, like, the girl I'm dating would leave me in a second for that.  Yeah.  Women don't put as much focus.  They would.  Of course they would.  I'd leave me for that.  Girls say it's not about the size, though, Jimmy.  Yeah, but he's a professional.  He has sex well, too.  He knows what he's doing.  He's not just big.  He has sex for hours.  Wow.  For money.  You can stand on his legs and do whatever you want. 
[01:42:30]  And give it to your right.  Stand on his legs.  And give it to your proper.  That move.  I've been depressed about size lately, because I've been very much enjoying the BBWs.  Oh, really?  Ew.  No, no, no.  Not big.  Beautiful whales.  Women, Jim.  Women.  Have some respect, please.  You like fatties?  Not fatties, but, like, I like a little chub.  Big-breasted.  You know what I mean?  Why?  Plump.  I don't know.  I just kind of like it sometimes, but, like, I am not well-endowed enough to ever satisfy.  You need to be.  One of these beasts. 
[01:43:00]  You know what I mean?  You've got to get past all that.  Yeah.  There's a lot of wrath.  There's a lot of that you've got to get past before you're getting to the areas that she, like, wants you to get to.  Before you get to the goodness.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, with a skinny girl, you're immediately there.  Yeah.  The goodness is pretty much on the outside.  Yeah.  I need a girl who's just getting over an eating disorder.  Just right there, teetering on collapse.  With a fat girl.  With a fat girl.  It's like standing on the lip of a volcano and looking down to kind of punch the lava. 
[01:43:30]  Yes.  By the way, I liked how that TV guy's insight into the scheme was, the whole trick is not getting caught.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that what the trick is?  Is that it?  We've got another guy.  I work for satellite operations at CNBC.  We always play around with this stuff off air.  So, I guess they kind of, like, mix in their own, like, make their own little show.  Oops.  Bless you.  There's a bunch of people that saw the clip.  Let's take a couple more of these.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Good, Jason.  Hey, uh, I'm from Long Island Station now where this happened, and, uh, the whole, I'm watching 
[01:44:00]  the game with my three-year-old daughter and my wife's on the computer, and she's like,  did you just put porn on?  Did you just, did you just order this?  I said, no, you know, what the hell, like, the remote's over there, and she's like, uh,  no, uh, turn it off.  That's a terrible story.  I've never heard.  Like, like, dude, it's not like the story's, like, bad, like, you're just telling what 
[01:44:30]  happened, but you, you tell an awful story.  This is about porn during the Super Bowl, and you're wrecking it.  Yeah, it's like, yeah, so then, you know, she said you put on porn, and I was like, like,  your, your delivery stinks, your timing's awful, your description is, is horrid.  He's got all the elements they're just there for.  Yeah, you, yeah, all this stuff is there.  You're like, you're like, it's like you're, you, you stepped up to where an artist had 
[01:45:00]  all of his stuff, his paints, the canvas, and you just picked up the brushes and just  slapped it on, and made crap, whereas an artist could have made something beautiful with the  same exact tools.  I apologize, guys.  All right.  No worries, Jason.  What happened at the end, Jason?  No, no, no, no, no.  We'll cut our losses.  What did she say?  We ate guacamole.  What happened?  Let's go to Brad in Arizona.  We'll try another one.  Brad, save us, Brad.  Brad.  All right, Brian.  Can we hear the story? 
[01:45:30]  Brad!  Oh, it actually, it happened twice.  The first time, it was the clips to the porn.  Yeah.  And they had it on for like 10 seconds, and then, I don't know, I guess they messed up,  and that was that.  All right.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is wonderful.  Riveting.  Yeah, let's go to, uh, Jason.  Wow.  Is there a pizzazz filter on the phones?  Now it's removed.  Oh, my God.  What lackluster human beings. 
[01:46:00]  I know it's porn.  It shocked them so much, they can't even speak.  Now all I want to do is go to the phones, though.  I know.  Jeff in Indiana.  Jeff, save us.  Please.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jeff.  I wanted to say, you got to take your hats off to this guy.  He pulled the ultimate Tyler Durden.  Yeah, a little Tyler Durden action in Arizona, right?  Frunkus.  And a frunkus.  Six hours.  Let's not forget.  Of course.  Anything more is queer.  Energy level up.  What are you going to do?  All right.  Well, enough of that. 
[01:46:30]  That first guy sounded like he was doing coke, and he couldn't get the word.  Uh-uh.  Yeah, uh, my wife.  Yeah, I know.  You've had conversations with people that are doing coke, and their jaw is grinding,  and they're just babbling with a story you don't want to hear.  I've noticed that from conversation I've had with people that actually have done it.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Conversations.  And the mirror.  Yeah, that's it.  We got an update.  Despicable.  Comcast is offering $5 discounts for everybody that saw the porn during the show.  Wow.  A dollar for every three inches. 
[01:47:00]  You are good at math, Jimmy.  Thank you.  When it comes to genitals, I was voted second most likely to guess girth.  Who was first?  My father.  Oh.  He's not gay at all, but his nickname was Size Queen Norton, and I was Size Queen Junior.  It was so hard following in his filthy shadow, his onion-y smelling shadow.  Joe DeRosa.  That's what happens when you work on the fly, folks.  Headline is Comedy Central special this weekend.  Yes, sir. 
[01:47:30]  Yes, sir.  That's it.  10.30 on Friday.  Good enough.  Hey, I think we saved the best story for last.  9-11.  9-1-1 call to the cops.  This is a good one.  This is a good one.  What makes it so special?  We'll tell you after the break, Anthony.  Hey.  Who fan Joe?  Sagan.  You like the who?  You know, man, they're all right.  I never really got into them.  I respect them, but don't get upset. 
[01:48:00]  Good boy, Joe.  He doesn't like the who either.  Every time you say that, somebody starts yelling at you.  They're very overrated.  They're kind of boring.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Really?  A couple good tunes.  You know.  Anthony's with me on this one.  The who, right, bro?  Come on.  I was a giant who fan back in what they call the day.  Yeah.  I like the day.  I just got annoyed at watching Townsend do this move over and over.  Yeah.  Like swinging the arm thing.  You're supposed to be impressed that he's strumming a power chord over and over.  Because he's doing a, you know.  You see the Springsteen thing where he almost strangled himself with his own guitar during 
[01:48:30]  the Super Bowl?  No.  What happened?  You didn't see his thing?  No.  He's trying to do his Pete Townsend thing, but somehow he, like, swings the whole guitar  around his neck.  Oh, yeah.  Then plays a note and swings again.  That's his thing.  I used to like the Roger Daltrey swinging the mic.  The mic.  He'd swing it out over the crowd.  You know what's so funny?  I watched a Springsteen concert on, like, VH1 Classics the other day, but it was only  from a few years ago.  Yeah.  And the band comes out two at a time, and the last two guys that come out are Springsteen 
[01:49:00]  with Clarence, the sax player.  And I was like, what the hell is Clarence going to do?  They don't have sax in the music anymore.  And they rip into the first song, and Clarence is sitting there with, like, a triangle.  Oh.  You know?  Clearly, they were just like, you could do this, and we'll still pay you.  Yeah.  Yeah, they kind of did, like, take the sax out of his, uh...  There hasn't been saxophone in a song since 89, I think.  They're like classics.  He played the halftime show, and they made sure, like, Clarence had his sax thing working. 
[01:49:30]  I think they chose songs where Clarence could, you know, join in the fun.  It's weird, too, seeing Max Weinberg on the drum.  Like, it just doesn't look right anymore.  It doesn't.  He looks like your father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He looks like your drum teacher.  Yeah.  I know that's hack to say, but he kind of has that very nerdy look now.  Yeah.  And he's just so used to seeing him on Conan.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, wearing a suit.  Yeah.  And he always plays, like, the nerdy, sort of, uh...  You know, he's the nerdy butt of the Joe.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Not the locker guy. 
[01:50:00]  Doesn't he...  And he's...  Doesn't he play drums old school, too?  He's kind of like the...  Yeah, with that Gene Krupa.  Yeah, Gene Krupa technique.  It's like anything from a drum manual from, like, 1955.  That's what I mean.  That's how you look.  Yeah.  He's a...  And now you just hold the drumsticks like hammers.  Smash.  Smashing.  Going nuts.  Yeah.  You don't go to Max for rock.  You go to him to learn how to do a paradiddle. 
[01:50:30]  And that's it.  And you move on.  That's what someone's saying here.  I come from the Buddy Rich school of drums.  Buddy Rich, man.  He was the best.  It looks like every song is going to start with...  Dun-da-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Yeah.  Rap-a-dee-bop-a-boo-ba-dop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee-bop-a-dee.  Joe DeRose in studio.  You might be on to something.  Brooklyn Ace, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, Joe?  They had him playing the cowbell on Sunday.  Oh.  So the Springsteen performance is being seen by millions, if not close to a billion people, 
[01:51:00]  and there's Clarence with the cowbell.  The only instrument a little less nerdy than the saxophone at this point.  We'll let you play cowbell.  Anyone could do that.  Anyone can play a cowbell.  Go saxophone, cowbell, tambourine.  Saxophone, not as nerdy, my friend.  Come on.  I used to play sax, dude.  It's pretty nerdy.  I played it halfway into high school.  They always dip down, and they dip right back up on the high.  Bah, bah.  They go way back up. 
[01:51:30]  They rock back and forth with the saxophone.  More nerdy is the French horn.  French horn.  And what about those kids you went to school with?  We all tried music, right?  I tried being a drummer.  What about the guy with the massive bass that he had to walk around school with?  Who wants to take the upright bass?  Yeah.  No, that's cool.  No, but who wanted to take that home?  I saw these poor bastards carting this giant sarcophagus home with them, and then back  to the school.  Yeah.  Because he's trying to get on the school bus.  Like, play a flute.  All right. 
[01:52:00]  You got that little case that fits anywhere.  I was so jealous of the flute players, because I switched to drums, and it was...  Oh, my God, dude.  Do you want me to talk to a pain?  I brought my stupid drumsticks to school every day.  It was easy.  And then, yeah, we all had to wait as bass guy had to, like, haul his huge instrument onto  the school bus, but got its own seat and everything.  Yeah, it did.  Drums and guitar were the only way you could be in the jazz band and still potentially get  laid.  Yeah, yeah.  That was, like, your rock connection.  You're not going to get to a rock band with the French horn.  Yeah, that was your only hope. 
[01:52:30]  Like, but, yeah, French horn, tuba.  That wasn't it.  People played tuba.  That's another one where you're carting around just a giant piece of brass.  I have brass with me in this case that was the weirdest shaped case ever, the tuba case.  It's not convenient.  It's as long as your intestines isn't on.  But the tuba case you could take a nap on is very nice.  Put that up against the wall and lean back.  Very inconvenient.  You're good.  All right, where are we?  Oh, the 911 call. 
[01:53:00]  So, Sam, what do we got on this?  You and Danny tell me this is pretty damn good.  This is good stuff.  Well, yeah, I guess this guy got pulled over by the police, and he thought that they were  harassing him because they were telling him to get out of the car.  Well, they were then.  Yeah.  Man.  So he called 911.  He calls 911.  On the police.  But the cops are there.  So he thought new cops were going to show up and be sympathetic to his cause.  I love this guy.  And while the two cops are fighting, he could leave maybe. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Well, I'm a fan of all cops, but I like this particular guy.  This guy.  This takes balls.  Why call more cops?  He's pulled over by one cop.  And in the end, this one guy has seven cop cars.  This is the dumbest son of a bitch ever.  I love him.  You've got to love him, though.  You don't call the cops on the cops.  They're not going to help you. 
[01:54:00]  We got pretty good audio as he's calling other cops as the cops on the scene are harassing him.  Harassing.  Yeah.  You can hear it in his voice.  He's got, like, that thing that he thinks he's doing, the upright thing.  Like, no, you can't push me around.  I'm a citizen.  You know, these people that think they know the law when the cops pull them over, the cops don't want to know about your knowledge of the law or anything.  Tell it to the judge is what they say.  They are there to do their job, which if they deem you arrestable, you're getting arrested. 
[01:54:30]  Cooperate.  If they want you to step out of the vehicle, step out of the vehicle.  Don't start saying, my rights tell me blah, blah, blah.  Take it up with someone later, because at that time, you lose.  There's no way you win.  Is there a stipulation, though, that if you don't say something then, later you go, but my rights.  And they go, well, why didn't you say something?  The best thing you can do is shut your mouth.  Be courteous as a son of a bitch. 
[01:55:00]  And do whatever they say.  And if they want to cuff you and take you to jail, arguing isn't going to help.  You're going.  So go.  Just go.  Or you're going to get a resisting on you.  You're going to get other stuff.  Just leave.  This audio is amazing.  We got to get a funny face at me.  No, no, no.  Actually, we got to get this audio.  By the way, those are just white man rules.  I just spelled out.  I don't know what the black people do.  I don't know their rules.  I got to cut you short, because this audio is way too good, and it's going to take some time.  Here we go.  Guy says he's being assaulted by police officers and wants more police to come. 
[01:55:30]  More cops.  9-1-1, are you killed, ma'am?  No, ma'am.  Yes.  I'm being assaulted by an officer on I-4.  Please call my wife.  I'm being assaulted.  Call the lawyer.  And I'm being dragged out of my car.  This is ridiculous.  I'm being assaulted.  He's yelling at me and grabbing me.  And he has maced me once.  Okay?  This is not cool.  Get Channel 2, Channel 5, Top 35, all of them down here. 
[01:56:00]  This is crazy.  This is insane.  Now, as he's talking, are the cops messing with him right there?  Yeah, they're trying to get him out of the car.  And, like, nicely, obviously, you can tell by his phone call, they're not really jostling  him that much.  Yet.  Yet.  Because they will usually start with, sir, please get out of the vehicle.  Get off the phone.  Get out of the vehicle.  Sir, get out of the vehicle.  Get out of the...  And with this guy is just being an ass.  He's on the phone. 
[01:56:30]  I love when these idiots are on the phone.  We had another one where some woman was on the phone.  And she's, like, you know, complaining that she's not getting out of the vehicle.  And then they tase her.  Can we find that clip?  And it is fantastic.  And then you want to talk about an attitude adjustment.  Oh!  She went from surly to behaving.  Oh, that is just...  In a split second.  That is a jolt of behavior that they give you.  There is nothing better than...  Where's he watching somebody get tased?  Oh, he refused to give his license to Reg.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sorry.  All right.  It continues with this.  The guy starts telling police he's not a threat and starts screaming. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, we have several units on the way.  Good.  Okay.  That is great.  Can I have your name, sir?  He's dragging me out of my car.  Can I have your name, sir?  Hi.  Okay.  No, I'm going to hold the phone as long as I can.  Sir?  I'm not even fighting you.  It's like taking it.  I'm not even fighting you.  What do you want?  Okay, sir, you need to listen to what the truth is saying.  Sir?  I'm not going to put him on my court.  Sir?  Sir?  I am not a threat to you.  This is what the truth is saying.  I am not a threat to you. 
[01:57:30]  You're not all afraid.  You're not doing it.  Get out of my car.  Help!  This guy's beating me.  You're not going to.  Sir?  I am not.  I am not.  He turns into a chick.  Sounds like he's like Dave.  That is great.  Only a few will get that.  Oh, what an ass.  There's nothing better than listening to Payne turn a man into a woman. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's great.  You can see in the video the cops have him pinned down to the street,  and then all of a sudden four more cars come running up,  and all of them, cops get out of the car.  Just pounce on him.  Yeah, of course.  And there's the cops.  He falls.  Of course they're going to.  Oh, of course.  He thought those other cops were going to swing in like Serpico.  They'd be like, hey, these cops are dirty.  All right, let's get it in the morning.  Yeah, hey.  IAD, get off that man.  They came in.  They go, oh, this guy's half beaten already?  Great.  We'll step in here. 
[01:58:30]  What an ass.  This guy is the dumbest individual.  Yeah, I need more cops to beat me.  Yeah, there's some of me that doesn't have road rash yet.  Because you're calling more cops than just beating you.  That's like if 10 Crips are beating you up, and you're like, bring more Crips to stop these Crips.  Stop the Crips.  I want more Crips.  The other Crips won't approve.  Yes.  They'll say that I'm a citizen, and you should let me be.  What a deluded idiot this guy is. 
[01:59:00]  Idiot.  That's what the operator said.  She was like, well, I'm sending like four more cars.  And he was like, please do.  Please do.  Please.  Thank God.  We'll get to the bottom of this.  And then the cops pull up any time.  I've watched so many cop shows.  Any time an officer is struggling with a man on the ground and more cops pull up, do they A, sit and watch, B, stand back until the officer needs assistance and then step in, or D, A, B, C, C, C. 
[01:59:30]  You forgot C, you dumb MF.  Yeah.  The wheels are coming off.  That's me.  The wheels are coming off.  Well, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, I'm a frat girl getting gang raped in a house right now.  Could you call more frats, please?  We need more frat boys.  And of course it was.  The line is.  Just jump out of the car and plant as many knees into the back of the guy's neck as possible.  D was possible, too, because if you had A, do nothing, B, wait until the officer needs help, C, could have been, do they wait and see who's at fault? 
[02:00:00]  Because it could be the officer because the guy called the guy.  So they don't know who to help.  Yes.  They may have to help the guy.  Right.  And then, D, get out of their cars and begin bashing the suspect.  And just pummel the man.  Stephen.  Steve Martin dropped something.  Wow.  It's not.  Stephen S. from Bayshore writes, I'm a tax.  He writes, I'm a taxpayer.  I demand to be taken directly to death row.  We got the last part of the phone call here.  I have, like, seven minutes in the row right now. 
[02:00:30]  What the?  Get off of me.  Get off of me.  I don't, I don't have anything.  Sir?  I don't have anything.  Good Lord.  Hello?  Are you still there, Orange County?  Yeah, I am.  Okay, I think his cell phone disconnected.  Ah.  Well.  Ah.  It was weird.  20 cops were stomping his head in cell phone.  Operator, I think we've been disconnected. 
[02:01:00]  Guys, just pummeled.  Yes, he's got a friends and officers plan on his phone.  There you go.  He has, he has a black iPhone.  Okay.  Do the bitch.  Do the bitch.  That's all right.  Oh, what an idiot.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  What an idiot.  Just more cops.  Love it.  That's awesome.  That really is awesome. 
[02:01:30]  You can tell by listening to him, but the guy was at fault because he's such a dumbass.  Yeah.  He deserves the beating he got.  Well, here's the thing.  It says in the thing, in the story, he was doing 72 in a 65.  How did it even escalate to the cops dragging him out of the car?  Unless he was being a douche.  Right.  You know what I mean?  From the jump.  He refused to give a license and registration.  He was barely.  So, right off the bat, he's being a douche that the cops do not like guys like this.  And it's like you said, the first thing out of his mouth is probably, I know my rights.  I know my rights. 
[02:02:00]  Let me recite to you the law because I, all right, I got to punch you.  I was not speeding.  If I was a cop, that'd be my trigger phrase.  I know my rights.  That would send my arm instinctually to my nightclub or my billyclubs immediately.  Just start, just give him, not even a swat with it because he's in the car.  Just poke him in the head with the end of it.  Bonk.  Ow.  That's brutality.  Where's my phone?  9-1-1.  Hello, opera.  He must have been laughing like, do you know my buddies are going to show up? 
[02:02:30]  The guys that we goof about idiots like you are going to show up and we're all going to beat you.  It's the equivalent of a heckler to a comedian.  When comedians sit around and go, dude, this lady tried to heckle me.  I literally made her cry and walk out of the room.  And she would be screaming, bring more comics on stage.  They'll goof on you, I bet.  And then the comics come out and she's just dead.  It's the dumbest thing this guy could have done. 
[02:03:00]  We got that clip to end this.  Did you guys find it?  Oh, we're trying to find it?  That clip you're talking about.  The lovely woman that's cooperating.  This reminds us of one of our favorite clips.  If you don't cooperate, and I've heard this from Keith Robinson and Patrice, a couple of the other brothers, when they talk about when they get pulled over, they have an instant attitude.  And they say they do.  Like, Keith is adamant about it.  Keith especially.  He's terrible.  And he's not unapologetic about it.  He doesn't care if there is no reason.  If he gets pulled over, he's just like, why are you pulling me over, mother? 
[02:03:30]  And he'll just start cursing at the guy.  And it's like, no wonder you're on the pavement with your face just getting grinded away and getting the cuffs put on.  I think he's mellowed with age a little bit.  Has he?  Yeah, his son's getting older.  I think he doesn't want a son to see his dad getting beat up.  Hopefully he can pass that on to his son.  Yeah, Keith's probably got osteoporosis by now when he's 67 years old.  Sallowing with age.  We're running out of show, but we want to sneak this clip on.  Yes, E-Rock?  Well, actually, there's two clips. 
[02:04:00]  There's one where the lady says she's cooperating and they tase her anyway.  Yeah.  But she wasn't.  I saw that clip.  Yeah, and then there's a lady in Florida who was on a cell phone and was ignoring the cop.  I'm cooperating here.  I think it's the second one.  Are they both short?  Yeah, under a minute.  All right, let's play the first one.  I'm going to rip.  Open the door.  You're going to get tased.  Okay?  Open the door.  All I've got to say is...  Open the door.  I'm not drunk.  Open the door.  I'm going to drive my husband out of the car.  Open that door right there.  You're going to get tased. 
[02:04:30]  Do you hear me?  Incident cooperation coming up.  Get out.  Okay?  Go ahead and get out that door.  Thank you.  Step out.  You don't have to test me.  Yes, I do.  Step out of the car, ma'am.  No, you don't.  I'm getting out of the car voluntarily.  Get out of the car.  Step out now.  Okay, so you can get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  Step out.  You can get off of me.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Step out.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  You can get out.  Ma'am, right now you're under arrest.  Okay, get off of me.  You're under arrest.  That's fine.  Get off of me.  I'm getting out voluntarily.  Are you going to step out? 
[02:05:00]  I'm getting out of the car.  She's getting out of the car.  Put your hands behind your back.  Look, how am I going to say?  Put your hands behind your back.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Put your hands behind your back.  Now.  Put your hands behind your back.  March Simpson.  She sounded like she hit the first hill on a roller coaster. 
[02:05:30]  That is fantastic.  They got her out of the vehicle.  She stepped out.  They were arresting her.  So they grab her to put her arms behind her back.  And she's like, don't touch me.  Like, no, you're under arrest.  We don't let you put your own cuffs on, you know?  So she's like, don't touch me.  And she starts fighting.  And now when that taser hits, all right, hands behind the back, whatever you say.  Dude, as soon as he said two things.  As soon as he said taser, I'd be like, okay.  Whatever.  Forget it.  Forget it.  But how excited was that cop just being like, I said it.  I did the rule book thing that I had to do. 
[02:06:00]  I said, you're going to get tasered.  You're going to get tasered.  Please don't cooperate.  Please.  I'm going to get to use my taser right now.  I'm in the clear.  You've got to think that's where the thing is.  We've got to get the last clip on.  Let's get this one, too.  These are too good.  But Goodwin stays in the car.  Talking on her phone, Officer McNevin reaches in to pull her out.  He's arresting me.  Stop.  Don't touch me.  The policeman is.  You're going to shoot me.  He's got a gun and he's going to shoot me.  Three times, Officer McNevin warns Goodwin that he will use his taser.  Get out of the car or I'm going to tase you. 
[02:06:30]  The next street off the secret.  Put your hands behind your back.  Do it now.  Do it now or you're going to get tased again.  It's over and done with.  We've been tased before.  We know it's not that bad.  It's over and done with the sound you've been tased before.  Okay. 
[02:07:00]  God, is that great?  Oh, that sound is fantastic.  It's so abrupt.  It's just right in the middle of, you know, you don't have to do this.  I've got to.  Ah!  Ah!  We've been tased before.  That's probably the deal.  They go, you have to get tased once, but then you can use this as long as you say we're going to tase you.  Would you take the initiation to get your tased?  Would you take that deal?  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, you would take the tase.  As long as I get you.  Well, there's also, I think you might have it in your replay, actually, of the guy who's not cooperating. 
[02:07:30]  And then he gets tased and then it's immediately, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.  Oh, that guy.  I want to get tased.  I want to try that because I know it's not going to kill you.  I don't know.  And it's got to, they did it on Jackass and it put Johnny Knoxville down for a while.  And I was like, if they put that guy down, it's got to really, really hurt.  Like, it.  Well, he's no choice.  Also the screen.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:08:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Which is the tase?  Is the tase the one that shoots the grappling hook?  Yeah, yeah.  That's all.  And then you just rock it.  Oh, that's great.  The little hook schedule.  Ah!  Oh!  Oh!  It's the!  Oh!  It's the!  It's the!  Oh!  That's some overacting right there.  Come on.  Oh, that's fantastic.  It just shoots those Hellraiser pinhead hooks right in the chest.  It just...  And then, of course, the first tasing ever, Orson Welles. 
[02:08:30]  Oh!  We've run out of show on this side, unfortunately.  We're heading over to SiriusXM.  Joe DeRosa, Comedy Central special this weekend.  Yes, sir.  Saturday, 1030?  Friday night at 1030.  Friday at 1030 for Joe DeRosa.  We like Joe a lot.  And Jimmy's got Caroline starting this Thursday.  Thursday through Sunday.  Caroline's six shows total.  Right on.  Okay.  And getting a lot of requests for our Black History Month.  We'll play it again. 
[02:09:00]  Every day, Joe, we're kind of like giving somebody some recognition for Black History Month.  Oh, yes!  We're being very, you know, helpful.  Very cool.  Very cool.  Very cool.  I'm excited to hear it.  And today's was really good, and they want to hear it again.  So here it is as we leave you.  We'll see you tomorrow.  To celebrate Black History Month,  The Opie & Anthony Show is recognizing those historic African Americans  without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor State Representative Alvin A. Holmes from Montgomery, Alabama, 
[02:09:30]  whose diction, vocabulary, and public speaking ability have set a benchmark  for Black politicians for years to come.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Well said, much mouth.  Stay tuned for more icons of Black History.  I want to name some of them other beers.  Budweiser, what is it?  No.  On The Opie & Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  All right, continuing with The Opie & Anthony Show,  Joe DeRosa made the walkover.  Nice.  He's got a nice little special on Comedy Central,  Friday night at 10.30.  It's good to see you, man.  Good to see you, man.  Thanks for having me.  I've been watching Joe bum around these comedy clubs for years,  and finally, he's getting a break.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  That fart is just ridiculous.  Dude, what am I supposed to do?  I got upset about something, and things happen. 
[02:10:30]  The upsetness had to come out.  We're thinking about what I did here.  We're talking about Joe DeRosa and his Comedy Central special.  But I've fired him before.  I like you.  You got a good scent.  I know I do.  Nice manly ass scent.  It's nice and even, you know.  It's funny.  It's not too gross.  What are all the goods over there you got?  Some kind of nasal stuff?  Yeah, because I took Africa for a couple of days.  How's your nose?  Better.  After the surgery, it happened.  But occasionally, the allergies get you.  The surgery doesn't help the allergies. 
[02:11:00]  Okay.  I just want to make sure the little genie's okay.  I am, but it makes you tear.  I have the saline here.  Not that much.  I don't care that much.  Yeah, you're right.  It was a quickie, Jimmy.  It was a quickie, a quickie.  But you knew it was going to get bad.  It was like, how are you doing?  I'm doing okay.  Okay, good.  Let's move on.  Here's how you knew it was going to get bad.  Because I went, ahem.  I couldn't listen to it.  Oh, my God.  That was a funny ass.  How are you doing?  Let me explain to you now some of the ingredients.  We got the Zeppelin thing.  Oh, good.  I didn't forget Joe.  Cool.  Joe was talking about Zeppelin ripping off everybody. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, it was like, I kept hearing about it, and I YouTubed it, and there was like a couple  songs.  But the story was that Bill Burr, who's a ridiculous Zeppelin fan, we talked about it, and we got  into this huge fight, and he was screaming at me.  I didn't know what I was talking about.  Because you can't tell Bill anything, really.  Then two weeks ago, he called me, and he goes, dude, I got to say, man, I'm really, he was  heartbroken, because it just keeps snowballing.  They keep adding songs.  They were apparently a huge rip-off band. 
[02:12:00]  They just ripped off everything.  Mostly blues musicians.  Yeah.  And it was sort of the thing to do in the late 60s, early 70s.  They sort of did it.  Yeah.  Say it, ahem.  What are they going to do?  Fuck it.  This is what we do now.  Well, I'll take it.  Oh, God.  I see.  This does end the Sabbath Zeppelin debate that I've been fucking fighting for years.  Have you?  Yes!  Oh, my God.  I bet if people looked into it, Sabbath probably ripped off a bunch of poor black people. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, shit.  I only invented the fucking genre.  Called it Black Sabbath.  Probably, you know, because they're ripping off the black man.  I'm sure that wasn't the first choice of the name.  But then someone goes, you'll never get that on the album.  Others.  Hey, Danny, where's the spirit thing with Stairway to Heaven?  That's the one I really want to play for, Joe.  That's so incriminating.  Stairway, dude.  That's so incriminating.  Fucking Stairway.  I never liked that song to begin with.  But now that it's ripped off, it's even more infuriating.  I don't even care about this because I've always hated Zeppelin. 
[02:13:00]  I've never liked Robert Plant.  He was able to sing for the records, I guess, in the studio.  And then never again was he able to hit those notes.  You know, it's funny.  It sucks.  I was watching a clip from The Song Remains the Same.  Yeah.  That's not funny, Joe.  They were...  It gets hilarious.  Hold on.  I'm waiting.  But, no, they were doing one of their famous songs where he really is like...  And, like, the whole time they're doing it live, he's just like... 
[02:13:30]  Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night.  Yeah, yeah.  So it was really...  I think it was a whole lot of love.  A whole lot of love.  It wasn't a whole lot of love.  It was...  I can't remember it.  It's every Zeppelin song because Plant was known to have that high voice.  You'd put on the albums and listen and go, you know, he's...  Wow, he's really cranky.  And then live, it was just like...  He'd hit the high parts and then put the mic out to the audience, which pisses me off  to no end. 
[02:14:00]  You want to hear, like, the singer really nail those fucking notes, and they'd give the  mic to the audience and let them do it because they can't fucking hit it.  Yeah, at least drop it down a half step.  The whole song, yeah.  And sing, yeah, and just sing the fucking thing.  Drop the whole song down.  Don't just try to drop down, like, the parts you can't hit anymore because then it's like,  you know, he did, uh, oh, uh, you need...  And then when they go, la, he did this, la, and brought it up from, like, the fucking 
[02:14:30]  basement and didn't even get to the point where it was that high.  It was awful.  I've hated Zeppelin.  That's disappointing.  And I know you gotta...  If you're on the road every night, you can't...  You know what I mean?  That's where, if you don't like the who, uh, you gotta give Daltrey a fucking, uh, a little  credit there.  The guy always got up on stage and hit all those fucking notes.  He was a lip-syncer.  Oh, shit, was he?  Fuck me, then.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, okay.  We like little, like little kids.  We're those downs and fuck them. 
[02:15:00]  They all...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Joe, let's get into this.  You got, uh, Zeppelin with the famous riff from Stairway to Heaven, right?  It's not just like Zeppelin.  There's a lady who knows all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
[02:15:30]  Robert Plant, everybody.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you.  Sing along now, because I won't sing another note.  So...  Fucker.  Uh, big-headed dummy.  That's gonna...  That was the original, right?  That's Zeppelin.  That's Zeppelin.  From 71, okay?  You go back to 1968, three years before Zeppelin came up with Stairway to Heaven, there's  a little band called Spirit that didn't do too well, commercially.  Apparently not.  Why?  It's such a great name for a band.  They had the one hit.  What was the one hit by Spirit that people kind of know, uh, we're a shitty airline? 
[02:16:00]  Well, they had a song called Taurus that no one heard of, right?  What?  But it is on a record.  Okay.  And they put it out in 1968.  Taurus to Heaven?  All right.  Uh, three years before Stairway.  Listen how close this is.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:16:30]  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  I'll think we can use that one.  It was a one-note difference.  Safe to say Spirit's not, uh, living in castles all over the world like Zeppelin is.  They don't live in the Shire.  Oh, I certainly think we can buy a little bit of that one.  There's a black man we cheated. 
[02:17:00]  Amazing.  Damn.  That hurts.  That hurts.  That's ridiculous.  That was like, remember the, remember the vanilla ice behind the music where he was trying  to defend ripping off the Queen riff?  Oh, yeah.  And he was saying that it was different because it went like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  instead of ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Did you fucking shut up?  You dummy, you pez head fucking asshole.  Ours was different because we didn't have David Bowie singing on ours.  Yeah, that's the difference.  So we start there today.  We've got some other Zeppelin examples that we have not done yet. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, cool.  Joe brought this to our attention, so why don't we do this today?  You've got Willie Dixon doing...  How do we do this, bro?  How are we doing this today?  Are they both on the same track?  Wait a minute.  Is it a mash-up?  Yeah, they're both on the same track, I believe.  You sure?  Yeah.  We're a little confused here.  Hold on.  It's been a while since I made the CBS.  I think they're both on the same track.  I think they fade into one another.  Willie Dixon and then Zeppelin, a whole lot of love, okay? 
[02:18:00]  Okay.  I think it starts with a little Willie Dixon and then goes into the Zeppelin.  It's only 12 seconds.  Willie Dixon, I remember writing this song back in 1948.  Zeppelin did get a lot of their songs from the blues artists.  Yeah, but they changed their...  Baby, way down inside, woman, you need love.  Way down inside.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my fucking God.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, you fucking thieving, colonizing fucking crackers.  Wow.  It was just a thing to do back then.  Oh, what?  There's a lot of other artists that did this.  Wow.  They're fucking thieves.  I don't have my knowledge in front of me, but there's a bunch of others.  Wow.  Other artists that did this.  Robert Plant, to be fair, changed a couple lyrics to be about hobbits instead.  And, you know, then it's fair.  But just the way they got their inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame immediately,  like these fucking faggoty Rolling Stone writers, I guarantee none of them ever called 
[02:19:00]  Zeppelin out on this.  Dawn checking in.  My sister, Dawny.  Dawny.  Hi, Dawn.  Say hi to little Warren Dean.  His christenings coming up on the 16th.  I am the gut father.  Warren Dean.  Little Warren Dean.  He's going to be an indicted politician when he throws up.  Some scandal.  Some scandal's in his young future.  Isn't it Warren for Warren Zeva?  Huh?  I don't know why my brother and sister chooses not for the same kid.  Well, Warren's father's like a music guy, so he got the Warren from somebody. 
[02:19:30]  And my brother names his daughter Layla.  They're just like fucking music guys.  Why not?  Fucking guys.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to name my kid Spirit.  Spirit.  Dawn is saying Cheap Trick's The Flame is Spirit's Nature's Way.  Now, that was their hit, I guess.  Spirit had a song called Nature's Way.  Spirit just got raked.  Spirit was just the fucking whore for all the other bands.  Because Nature's Way, I know that song, it really wasn't a hit. 
[02:20:00]  No.  It was sort of a hit.  And then Cheap Trick did The Flame.  Let's find that one, too.  You got The Flame?  Cheap Trick The Flame.  Cheap Trick The Flame.  And Nature's Way by Spirit.  Danny, this song, that was a terrible ripple.  Oh, yeah.  Was there more to that song?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just a nice little example.  Well, I mean, it was just, from what I recall, it was just like, that's the main portion that  was lifted.  Like, a lot of these, a lot of these Zeppelin will now acknowledge that, you know, they  did, you know, they did borrow.  But I think the biggest thing for Zeppelin, and why it's looked upon in such a negative 
[02:20:30]  way, is that on the writing credits for the songs, they never, it was always Paige Plant,  they never accredited these blues musicians.  Get Nature's Way and The Flame.  Dawn makes a great point.  We haven't done that one in a while.  So, here's another Willie Dixon, Zeppelin thing.  For the Zeppelin fans, you know the song, I Can't Quit You, Baby.  Right.  Here we go.  That's the setup here.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, I've got to put you down for a little while.  Oh, I can't quit you, baby.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So, I'm going to put you down for a while.  All right.  There's no argument there.  There's not even a discussion with that one. 
[02:21:30]  You know, Willie Dixon rules, by the way, man.  Willie Dixon, wow, he was the man.  They should be yanked out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the same way fucking Pete Rose  can't get into the baseball Hall of Fame.  This one's weird, though, because it was kind of accepted back then.  The guys were ripping off the blues musicians.  Willie Dixon is ass by Led Zeppelin.  It's kind of like the same way when the British invasion was happening over there.  A lot of American bands tried to sound like English bands, and it worked in reverse over 
[02:22:00]  there.  The British bands started to try to sound like old American blues musicians.  Something like it, and totally tightening every single aspect of it.  And we don't want to be accused of ripping off anyone, so we have a Ron and Fez.  Spy Report.  Ah.  Steve Martin on Regis and Kelly, if we could take a peek at that to see if we could exploit  his awfulness on our show today.  Yardbirds.  Oh, wait, you got the cheap trick?  All right, do The Flame, because most people know cheap tricks, The Flame. 
[02:22:30]  The Flame.  Give us a little.  Ugh.  This song sucks.  Tent, tent.  So lonely.  I kind of fucking cheated.  I didn't know who this was.  This is Robin Zander?  Yes.  God, cheap trick blows.  Have they ever had a cool song?  The Dream Police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  The Bo Police.  Oh, God.  Remember this?  All right, that's enough. 
[02:23:00]  Might be the chorus, but who knows, let's see.  No, trust me, it's the riff, you'll hear it immediately.  Now this is Nature's Way.  Nature's Way by Spirit.  The song, by the way, that sort of got played was I Got a Line on You.  Thank you, Stig, for coming back.  Here is Nature's Way by Spirit.  Is the drummer in Spirit smoking a cigarette also? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, it's very similar.  It says different lyrics.  I think there was a huge lawsuit over this one.  Yeah?  Spirit wasn't playing.  They said, fuck you, cheap trick.  It's like, all right, Zeppelin already dicked us up the ass.  Find us an if on this.  I think they didn't get away with this one.  There's a Green Day song called Scattered from an album called Nimrod that they did,  and it is a complete jack of Sister Golden Hair.  Oh, really? 
[02:24:00]  In America.  Oh, yeah.  Complete jack.  Green Day, they come up a lot.  They're repeat offenders.  Really?  Yeah, I have a few of their examples.  Let's focus on Zeppelin a little bit more, and then we'll go in other areas.  Well, because there's also another band, Jesus Christ, around the same time as Green Day and  everything, that just every song that they did was a rip-off.  I'll have to remember.  Okay.  Foundry?  Foundry Music, yes.  That was them.  The best one ever, though, was CCR.  What's his name?  Had to sue himself, or what the hell was that whole lawsuit about?  Oh, sued like his brother.  What the hell was his name? 
[02:24:30]  John Fowler.  John Fowler.  He got sued by the label, and then he went into court and actually played his songs to  be like, look, here's where you're wrong, and he won.  But somehow he had to sue himself, or that's another weird case, if you can find info on  that, or somebody out there might have a little more info on that.  See, this stuff does matter, too, because every year in these countdowns, Stairway to  Heaven is considered the number one rock song of all time.  Yeah.  So that translates into fucking album sales.  Oh, yeah.  And all that shit.  It's like, that's just really annoying me.  This is really annoying me.  Dave the Trucker wants to defend Zeppelin a little bit. 
[02:25:00]  Dave, go ahead.  Hold on.  I don't know if I got you guys up today.  There we go.  Dave, go ahead.  Yeah, hey, boys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hey.  Yeah.  Lemon's song on the second album is Led Zeppelin's big problem.  Willie Dixon was credited on the first album for both I Can't Quit You and You Shook  Me.  Right.  On the second album, the Lemon song was ripped off from a whole bunch of old blues songs,  and they took writing credit for that one. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, we got that one.  The Lemon song ripped off Howling Wolf, Killing Floor, ripped off Bring It On...  Oh, wait.  Okay, all right.  I think it was Howling Wolf, Killing Floor.  We'll get into that as well.  Thanks, Dave.  Here's the Yardbirds doing...  Which one is this, Danny?  Yardbirds, Days of Confuse.  Yeah, it's Days of Confuse.  Now, keep in mind that Jimmy Page was in the Yardbirds, and they did their own version  of the song, pretty much, and then I guess when Page went over to Zeppelin, he just kind 
[02:26:00]  of took it with him.  You'll hear it.  And it's a Jake Holmes song originally, Days of Confuse?  Yeah, so it wasn't even...  All right.  Original.  Listen to this.  We'll be right back. 
[02:26:30]  I'm busy, confused, as you say, as you go.  I'm being abused, and I think I should go.  Come on, baby, I'm just starting to cry.  You're out to get me, you're on the right track.  Yeah, see... 
[02:27:00]  That wasn't the Zeppelin one?  No!  That was a live Yardbirds.  Well, the Yardbirds, when Zeppelin came around, they were supposed to be called, what, the new  Yardbirds or whatever?  That Jimmy Page was in the Yardbirds and, of course, in Zeppelin, but still.  Wow.  Dude, it's one thing to steal from stage trains.  You've got to be a real piece of shit.  Just to give you the reference, steal from your old band. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  We all know the song, right?  Holy shit.  Oh, one of you motherfuckers call up and have that fucking old argument with me now.  One of you.  Wow.  Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true.  More little woman.  More little woman never bargained for you.  He hit it out of the park, though.  That's why it's a cover song. 
[02:28:00]  It's why it's a cover song.  It did fucking great.  He said, she'd do a happy birthday to me.  Nassholes.  What are you?  How did that song go?  Nice.  Anthony, was the band Offspring?  It was Offspring.  I think it's She's Got Issues and Obladee.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I think we have that somewhere.  We'll find that.  No, no, no, no.  The ripoff of Obladee was Why Don't You Get a Job by the Offspring.  Is that...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's right.  You're right.  You're right.  I couldn't remember the song.  I thought it was...  Hey, we got...  Thank you, Kenny. 
[02:28:30]  We got another great one for the Zeppelin fans out there.  Black Mountainside.  Great.  It's a great Zeppelin song.  It was originally called Black Waterside.  Supposedly, it's a traditional...  What?  It's a traditional folk song.  Folk song.  That's actually really good.  But...  I'd like to play it for you now.  Here to go.  It's a traditional folk song, but Jimmy Page on Zeppelin 1 just gave all the credit  for himself.  Yeah, he just gave himself right.  I don't know the song's been around forever.  Here's the original.  It became Zeppelin.  Page wrote and perfected it with Zeppelin.  What's the fucking problem? 
[02:29:00]  It was never talked about as a Yardbirds song first.  People just credited Zeppelin with that.  You know what the problem is.  And also, yeah, that one song, but how about the other fucking 30?  Yeah, and what about...  I mean, you know, the first track we just heard was from a guy named Burt Janch, and it's  not his song.  It's a traditional folk song.  And if, you know, if you want credit for the arrangement, that's one thing also, but  Page, he just ripped off Janch's arrangement of that song in the first place.  Yeah, it's the same exact way.  How do you just credit it to yourself? 
[02:29:30]  It's so devastating as, like, a performer to hear something.  Could you, like, Jim, could you imagine if, like, you know, like, as a comic, you know,  we talk about how brilliant Pryor was, and then if somebody was like...  I don't talk about that.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Why would you ever talk about that?  That's crazy.  I'm a Jake Johansson fan, as you know.  But if you...  But if somebody was like, oh, you think Pryor's great, listen to this old Jackie Gleason bit,  you know, and Jackie Gleason's like, my father died in the pussy.  You know what I mean?  That would be worth it.  That would be worth it to destroy my image of Richard to your fucking... 
[02:30:00]  Gleason.  Jackie Gleason doing all prior bits back in, like, fucking 50s.  Yeah.  Do you notice the exorcist?  Alice Pussy Stank.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan, this is a good topic.  The phones are lit.  What up, Ryan?  Now, the deal with the John Fogarty deal was his record label owned all the rights to the Creedence Clearwater stuff.  And whenever he went solo, he actually got sued by the record company because he sounded too much like Creedence, 
[02:30:30]  which he wrote all the songs.  Oh, right.  He was in a tough position.  He's...  It sounds too much like the band.  I was the band.  What am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good, man.  He won, though.  He played guitar in court to show them...  There was a difference.  Yeah.  Beat himself out.  Yeah.  Now he's allowed to do the Creedence stuff again.  Here's the Lemon Song by Zeppelin.  Oh, more taste.  I should have pushed you all down again. 
[02:31:00]  There's the key on this killing floor. 
[02:31:30]  Well, now we go to Howling Wolf.  It might sound a bit familiar.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  It's a standard bluesy kind of thing.  It's your cousin Marvin.  Marvin Plants.  You know that new sound you're looking for?  Maybe it's a time machine thing that happened.  I should have pushed you...  Now I'm enjoying it, Ed.  I like that.  That was good.  Really good.  A long time ago... 
[02:32:30]  Thank you.  I should have put your face...  A long time ago...  I should have put you...  Yeah.  And went on the black-edged coat...  Stealing from the Negro, man.  That was like...  That was like what they did.  Now I get it.  Yeah.  Now I get, like, why so many black people are so mad about rock and roll.  Like, this is really... 
[02:33:00]  Why does that make them argue with the police, though?  I don't understand.  Like, the police didn't...  I don't mean the band.  I mean the actual police.  They didn't rip off your songs.  Can we get somebody to taser Robert Plant?  Yes.  He needs a tasering by some black people.  Hey.  Someone is telling me that I refuse to acknowledge this.  Well, I guess I'm acknowledging it by bringing it up, but...  Yeah.  You know, I saved my own self here.  Nirvana, Come As You Are.  Come on.  That's an original song, right? 
[02:33:30]  No, it's not.  Oh.  Come on.  Uh-oh.  Come on now.  That's not what that says.  Come on now.  Saying they ripped off Killing Joke, a song called 80s.  Do we have that?  Hmm.  So, uh, do you have a little taste to come as you are first?  All right, hit it.  He should be shot in the fucking head.  Oh, damn it.  Fuck.  Shit.  I'm sorry.  What do they rip off?  The riff or the words?  Danny, you know?  Uh, this particular...  Well, this sounds just like it.  This particular one, I'm not sure.  But there's another...  I gotta look it up real quick, because I can't recall the band, but there was actually 
[02:34:00]  a lawsuit that was going to be settled for Nirvana ripping off this riff.  And what did he do?  He took the easy way out.  Yeah.  Of course.  And now we got Killing Joke...  Oh, I guess it is a song.  I guess this is what I was thinking of then.  Killing Joke, 80s.  Let's take a listen.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I still want you. 
[02:34:30]  That's the riff.  Nah.  That, to me, is like a collective unconscious kind of thing.  The riff, though.  It's like, wow.  It's a stolen riff, but it's...  I think everyone...  It's a stolen riff.  If you know anything about Kurt Cobain, he was into Killing Joke, so...  Really?  He was listening to their records, yeah.  I mean, but don't...  Jim, don't you think, like, some of these instances...  Like, Zeppelin, it's uncanny.  But it can be a matter of, like, with a comic, with parallel thinking. 
[02:35:00]  Parallel thinking...  You know what I mean?  ...is different in a certain degree, because that's just a kind...  Like, a word...  These are riffs, man.  I think that at times it can be this coincidence.  Like, oh, yeah, that's just kind of close.  But I really think that when it comes to something like that, that's a stolen riff.  But, I mean, Cobain acknowledged that he was doing Lead Belly's song.  They acknowledged they were doing the Meat Puppet stuff.  I mean, they would acknowledge that they were doing a cover.  That was an obvious cover.  He openly admitted it.  But a guy who takes a riff or two here and there is, to me, not... 
[02:35:30]  It can't be labeled a real thief.  Well, like Zeppelin.  But they realize...  Thieves.  I guarantee you, I owe me.  If you looked at I owe me stuff, he was a blues friend.  He's a blues guitarist.  You'd find all blues riffs.  I'm sure all artists have that.  But when it's a real thievery, it's fucking annoying.  We could continue this for a while, but I think we should wrap it up with this.  It continues to this day, and this suit was settled recently.  Coldplay has that huge song.  What was it called?  Viva La Vida.  Yeah, you know the song?  It's been played everywhere. 
[02:36:00]  Is that the new song?  I honestly don't know.  It was one of the new songs that was literally played everywhere.  You'll know the riff.  And Joe Satriani's like, get the fuck out of here.  This is my fucking song.  And Coldplay had to pay out Joe Satriani recently.  And what we got here is the mix of the two songs.  You'll recognize the Coldplay right off the bat here.  This song, right?  Oh, this is the mix.  Yeah, this is it.  That's that together.  Wait, we had it somewhere else, and I couldn't find it.  Hang on, hang on.  We'll end with that, because that's really good. 
[02:36:30]  It might be on it, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's there.  All right, yeah, yeah.  This is way better.  Okay.  And then play the other thing.  Yeah, then the other thing is amazing.  So which one is this?  Coldplay first?  Yeah, this is the original Coldplay, Viva La Vida, which was released just last year.  Okay.  You know the song.  I used to rule the world.  Seas would rise when I came to work.  Now in the morning I sleep alone.  Sweep the streets I used to own. 
[02:37:00]  All right, you get the point, right?  And then Joe Satriani, he had a song called If I Could Fly from 2004.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my.  Jesus.  It's a complete rip-off, yeah.  If Joe Satriani would have figured out how to put some fucking vocals in his song,  then I'm kidding.  How about you get a singer, idiot?  Shirk off guitar.  You could make a lot more money if you have the singer, dummy.  Why doesn't anybody want to hear me play guitar for 12 tracks? 
[02:37:30]  Good job, Gary Poe.  Way to go, Joe.  So then somebody took the two songs.  I would love to give them credit.  I don't think it's on the disc.  No.  Robert Plant.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, this was just some...  Put some of this fucking heat off of me to hear my call play.  Yeah.  Somebody mixed the two songs, and it sounds like Joe was meant to play along to the song.  Listen to this.  Okay.  I used to win the world.  Sees the lives of the day. 
[02:38:00]  To do it, let me know how to see.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  All you got to do is play that in court.  In this case, I think Joe Satriani should feel flattered if somebody found one of his songs  listenable.  I kind of with you, Joe.  Wait, you didn't like Summer Song?  I kind of do.  I like Clips is over a little bit, too.  Yeah, if only that was Joe Satriani. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, wait.  Who was it?  Who was Clips?  That's that other guy.  Eric Johnson.  Eric Johnson, right?  Fuck it.  Steve Vai.  Look at all the fucking same.  Fucking Yngwie Malmsteen.  That guy is good.  Shut it.  I just saw an interview with him.  Oh, he's such a dope.  On that Eddie Trunk show.  Oh, Florentine.  That metal show.  Yeah, and Florentine's on it.  So they just sat and debated Metallica's album for a while.  I was sitting there watching that one.  Holy shit.  Listen to these guys.  I was YouTubed some Yngwie Malmsteen guitar lessons. 
[02:39:00]  And the most beginner thing that he will teach you how to do is so lightning fast that you would  need to be playing guitar for seven, eight years before you could even attempt to do the  things that he's doing.  How good is Yngwie?  I mean, he's not...  He's very good, but...  It's all that scale shit.  Yeah, it's very technical, and he's also very repetitive.  So, you know, while he's extremely talented and he's lightning fast, if you buy more than  one album of his, you've probably bought one too many.  You'll hear that whole...  Yeah, all you need to do is play anything off of his first major release, which was called 
[02:39:30]  Rising Force.  It's called Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force.  That whole album I'll listen to over and over again, but then I made the mistake of buying  another one.  And I was like, wow, this is just...  It's Rising Force with bad vocals.  Who is he?  It's just upside down.  He's a guy who a lot of times people will mispronounce his name as Yngwie.  He's like, Yngwie, Yngwie, a lot of fucking...  Get a real name, you dumb fuck.  There's no way to talk about it, guys.  Yngwie Malmsteen.  He's got the last name of an accountant and the first name of someone from Jupiter. 
[02:40:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Dude, I was in a hotel the other day and I got in an argument with the manager of the  hotel and he was from France and his name was Philippe.  And it's like, no, it's Philippe.  Hey, Philippe, fucking asshole.  It is Philippe.  It'll always be Philippe.  I'm their girl.  Shut it.  Yeah, my friend goes, really?  His name's Philippe.  That's where I go.  If he's going to be a cunt in my country, we're going to do something by my rules.  Like, at least one thing can I have?  Go up, you fucking...  One more call before we move on. 
[02:40:30]  Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Hey there, Sean.  Sean, you still there?  Speak.  Good evening.  This sounds like something I want to check out, but I need more info.  Sean, going once?  No?  All right.  It says, video on YouTube, 36 songs, four chords.  What's that about?  Punching 36 songs, four chords on YouTube.  I bet it pops up.  Two girls eating guitars out of a cup.  Shoves it in his ass.  It breaks.  Daft Punk is another bad one.  Do you know Daft Punk?  Yeah.  They got some buttery beats there, Joe. 
[02:41:00]  I know.  I'm a big fan.  I like to dance.  Are you a fan of the buttery beats?  I do.  I don't like...  Wait, there's a difference.  I don't dance to buttery beats.  What do you dance to?  I don't dance.  Oh.  I've seen you dance.  It was my wedding.  I had to.  No, no, no.  I've seen you dance.  You were boogieing down.  Not really.  I've seen you dance.  You haven't seen me dance.  I have.  What the fuck?  If I'm playing some, like, Tiger Woods online, I need something in the background, I'll throw  on some buttery beats, but I'm not dancing in my chair.  What the fuck is buttery beats?  I thought you were just making it up. 
[02:41:30]  I think he is.  No, there's a video game called Luminous, and I...  Yeah, here you go.  This is a buttery beat.  I don't believe it.  You ever play Luminous?  No.  They got the buttery beats as you're trying to knock off the boards?  I'm not...  Luminous kicks Tetris' ass.  What is Luminous?  It's very similar to Tetris.  Right.  But way more addicting.  And gayer.  Music doesn't help my argument, but...  It really does put you in a trance, though. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  This stuff.  Although I do enjoy the first Luminous soundtrack better than anything that they put out since  What was the first soundtrack?  A guy sucking cock?  No, this is it.  All right, whatever.  Whatever.  If you want...  No, there's...  Liquid Todd on Sirius XM does zeros and ones.  That's kind of buttery beats.  Just remixes of songs you might know or might want to know.  Well, there was a Daft Punk thing on YouTube...  He does Daft Punk, by the way.  Where it's just...  Dude, they just... 
[02:42:30]  It's just the riffs.  Like, they did nothing to change...  I was really disappointed, because I actually really do like Daft Punk a lot.  And it was just...  They're lazy.  They're way lazier than I thought they were.  All right.  Can we find that video on YouTube?  Which one?  I know.  It's gone now.  36...  What was it called then?  36 songs?  Four chords?  Yeah.  See if there's anything there worth playing.  When we get back, because we get the curse over here, we got the Christian Bale thing  without the beefs.  It's so much fun without those fucking beefs.  And listening to him just curse this fucking director of photography up.  I haven't heard it. 
[02:43:00]  I haven't heard it.  Oh, it's great.  It's great!  Because the news is playing with the beefs.  We don't have to do that here, so...  No.  We'll replay it in just a bit if you missed it earlier today.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Joe DeRosa, Comedy Central special, Friday at 10.30.  Ah, Opie and Anthony.  Um, we got Sam in studio now.  We got electric traps set all over this joint.  We have a little bet going to see who's going to catch a mouse first.  So far, gotta be honest, you might not get the big happy ending by the end of today's 
[02:43:30]  show.  Nah, it's not one of these things that we can plan.  It's a fucking mouse.  I understand that.  You think it is.  But overnight...  It's not Mr. Jangles.  We don't know where this mouse is going.  Overnight, no one in this facility.  Mr. Jangles going to be in the mouse so he gets down in Florida.  Dummy, go fucking shave your head and get electrocuted.  Yeah, Mr. Jangles probably was under the fucking heel of his shoe.  How does he fire shoot out of your eyes, dummy?  Mr. Jangles.  I'd like to fucking take a nine iron and send Mr. Jangles on a trip. 
[02:44:00]  He's going to be in the mouse so he gets in Florida.  Is he?  You're a fucking delusional ass.  Coffee.  Strap in.  Coffee.  We got a mouse update there, sir.  Water.  Like the drink.  Get the mouse.  Shut up.  Motherfucker.  Well, all the traps have been set and reset, so they're all working.  Just in case.  In your spots that you chose this morning.  Very good.  And I think we may not have it by 11 o'clock, but by tomorrow morning, we could just have  a three-way tie. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  It could be.  Because once the lights go out.  It could be a three-way tie.  Unfortunately, we don't have, like, night shot cams.  We could set up to see which trap was sprung first.  Are we setting a camera on one of the traps for the pal talkers?  I don't know.  They can watch it all day?  What about the one E-Rock uses all the time when he's supposed to be working?  Oh, really?  Uh-oh.  What if the girls want to see E-Rock?  I know.  I know.  What if the girls want to see E-Rock?  They always want to see E-Rock.  Why would they want to see E-Rock?  I don't know.  Because he's famous. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, E-Rock's the famous E-Rock.  See, they're nodding out there.  They want to see E-Rock.  I'm pal talk.  Hey, uh, guys.  There's also something else going on.  Now, Buddy isn't here yet, but I'm hearing that he's going to lose his shit because we  might have messed with his...  Yeah, apparently he doesn't like people fucking with his shit, with his desk and everything.  Dude, we found a fucking mouse nest.  Yesterday, his area's been completely dismantled.  He is disgusting.  There is shit over there that is like just reeks, food, coffee cups, just everything. 
[02:45:30]  Discussed paper, which...  Paper!  Paper!  What a world.  Which mice love.  They fucking love just chewing the shit up and making nests out of it so they can have  80,000 more mice.  And this fucking guy gets upset when his area's fucked with?  Yes.  Very much.  Well, excuse me.  We share a space with this guy.  And if he comes in here and starts fucking mouthing off, I'll go over there and straighten 
[02:46:00]  his shit out.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Because...  Yeah.  And talks a lot of jazz.  He talks a lot of shit.  For a guy who will be in Runkonkama by the time Buddy walks in the door.  Yeah, exactly.  Runkonkama?  And talks a lot of mess.  What you don't understand is there's a chance that they would cross paths if Anthony decides  to stay here until 2 in the afternoon.  Right.  That ain't gonna happen.  Exactly.  You have a better chance at Hugh Pinero moonwalking in here with a tuba crest.  Oh, you didn't, Jimmy. 
[02:46:30]  No, the problem is he didn't ever.  Oh, you didn't, Anthony.  Fucking guy.  Who is Buddy?  Can I ask who that is?  Buddy?  He's a guy that had an opportunity to leave this facility for a nice brand new facility  and said no.  He had to make a stand for whatever reason.  I don't even know.  So, he's the only one that still works here among us, even though he has nothing to do  with the radio show.  Nothing.  Fucking asshole.  Who is he, though?  What's he do?  He fucking...  I don't know.  What does he do?  I don't know.  He produces higher standards or high standards or whatever the channel that used to be Frank's 
[02:47:00]  Place is.  But that's...  Frank's Place over now is serious, right?  Yes.  It's just called some high standards instead.  Whatever.  They call it now.  It's a lump of shit.  But it's a jukebox for the most part, isn't it?  No.  Jonathan Schwartzman comes in and...  Does she?  Schwartz.  Sorry, Jonathan Schwartz comes in and...  Schwartz.  Is that the kid from Rushmore?  Doesn't he do the Broadway channel?  He may.  I don't know.  He's vital to the organization.  No, that was the other guy who did decide that, you know, leave Opie and Anthony alone.  I'll go somewhere else and do my job. 
[02:47:30]  But this fuck decided, no, he has to stay here.  And then he's got a hoarding mess over there.  And he does have his chair chained to a file cabinet.  I thought they were lying about that.  And then a big sign on the back of his chair that says, mine.  Yeah.  Are you shitting me?  No.  Wow.  Fuck this guy.  I'll stay here.  I'll fucking hang out.  It's like Carl from Sling Blade's father's house.  It would be great if it's in mine and he sat on it and it blew up.  So, Ant, what would you do to Buddy if you stayed here until two in the afternoon to confront him? 
[02:48:00]  I'd explain to him in no uncertain terms that his fucking pile of shit that he doesn't want anyone to mess with is infesting our shared area with mice, which is not only unsanitary but dangerous.  There's something called the Hunter virus.  And the Black Plague that mice spread through their droppings.  So, I don't fucking need him bitching that somebody's fucking with his shit. 
[02:48:30]  How about he fucks with his shit?  You fuck with your shit.  Pick it up and put it in a garbage bag.  Along with all the fucking discs and everything else that you might use for that fucking whatever it is.  Oh, shit.  You're telling him.  Good.  Get in here.  He's not here.  I know.  I wish I would see him walk in.  All right.  Both of them.  So, do Rana Fez today.  What?  Sometime during the Rana Fez show, he'll walk in and then you could have this big confrontation.  Yeah, what the fuck?  You don't take any shit?  Yeah.  You take no shit?  Call me up. 
[02:49:00]  Three or four buds deep by fucking 1115.  I want to see you go to town on this guy.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to see some fucking shit.  I'm going to take it down to street level.  Yeah, are you?  Talk about it.  What is it?  Are you?  Yeah.  You just hit the bricks.  Yes.  Are you?  He is definitely a hoarder.  He shows up.  He saves all the cardboard boxes and he has them folded up and he has tons of cardboard boxes.  He's one of those people they're going to find in his apartment like when a stack of phone books fall over and crush him. 
[02:49:30]  He's a hoarder.  Do you think he's a hoarder?  Yes.  Do you think he's a hoarder?  Is that a box of pizza?  That was one of the most disgusting things I've seen in this establishment.  Do you think we have a maintenance crew that comes in and cleans up, though?  What?  Do you have no fucking maids that come in here?  They have the mice.  Maids?  I thought we had guys that come in and clean the office.  Oh, no.  Maids?  Yeah, what the fuck is this?  The fucking Ritz?  Who cleans the office?  Nobody.  No one.  You saw all those mouse droppings yesterday?  They fucking fired everybody.  They're going to keep a maid so we're happy with the fucking dust-free environment? 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, but it looks like Nutsy Fagin's house over there.  Nutsy Fagin.  That's really funny.  It looks like the fucking Carl's father's house.  Carl's father from Sling Blade.  What a shithole.  It was awful.  Oh, I'd rather sleep in the shed in the hole in the ground.  Yeah.  Poor little fella.  Duvall.  How does Joe Biden sleep with his eyes open?  How does this guy sleep at night?  Those eyes can't possibly close.  Oh, because of his tight skin.  Oh, my God.  Why, he has a wonderful hairdo.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, that is what is called the...  He got hair plugs like Anthony did.  No, he didn't.  He got hair plugs when they were called plugs.  They're fucking...  I have individual follicles that were placed from the area in the back of my head individually.  Uh-huh.  Just like your hair grows.  Can I see?  In the harvest area.  They got the...  From the harvest area.  They got the plugs from the harvesting area?  Yes, and they're not plugs.  You said yes.  No, they're not plugs.  You tricked me. 
[02:51:00]  Plugs were big rings of multiple hairs, like a hundred of them.  Yeah.  This procedure is individual follicles that are placed in the thinning area.  And just like your hair grows, they're put in exactly like that.  Sure.  The same grain, the same direction.  If you're...  You know, your hair grows in a certain direction.  If you have it faced in the wrong way, it's going to look silly.  You're not going to be able to brush it.  So they take that into consideration.  The natural hairline with these single follicles, if you're thinning in the front, that... 
[02:51:30]  Not plugs.  Plugs are what Joe Biden's got.  So they're single plugs, then?  No.  They don't even use the word plug.  Tiny plugs?  Except for me, when I say it, to get treatment.  No, I'm kidding.  Biden's plugs are actually held in with flesh-colored thumbtacks.  These are horrendous.  It's the worst hair to ever.  It's horrible.  Is it terrible?  He looks like John Forsythe after he got caught in a flash fire.  He looks like one of those guys that ran out of money.  You see him as you're walking around.  Oh, yeah.  The guy that ran out of money.  He's like, well, I was working on it. 
[02:52:00]  He looks like one of the guys from Trading Places at the end of the movie.  Mortimer.  Can I see your hair?  Oh, it's not ready for a debut yet.  It doesn't show anybody.  I'm greasing.  I've got to wait another two months, and then it'll start really growing in.  It's not with plugs.  It takes a fucking while.  It's not plugs.  They're individual follicles.  Some have one coming out of the single follicle.  Others have two, and some have three.  They use the single ones on the front to really give that nice, natural hairline. 
[02:52:30]  And then the three at a time, which comes out of one follicle, but three hairs.  It's a miracle.  They put in the back to really fill it out.  Is the other key difference that you have to wear a hat or a bandana for the rest of your life?  For a little like a fucking year.  A little baby.  I'm definitely noticing something's like some bristles.  Can you take your hat off?  We don't have to look at the top of your head.  I just want to see what your hairdo looks like.  No, because it's really a haircut.  You know what I did?  It's so bad.  I spray this stuff on. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, the spray hair?  No, not spray hair.  No.  The stuff, a guy will stand over you, and it comes in a flesh-colored puff.  Yes.  And it smells like chlorine.  So you're using that spray hair to that?  No, I don't.  No, it's a spray.  Oh, the black spray that makes your hair look full.  No!  You should just buy the hat.  No!  You should just buy the hat with the hair stapled to the back of it. 
[02:53:30]  The mullet baseball cap.  It's fucking Mike Myers' fucking hat in Wayne's world.  Especially when they redid it recently for MTV or whatever it was.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  No.  There's nothing worse than Fat Wayne.  Yeah.  Because he's just so fat.  Oh, I know, yeah.  Not a kid.  He was a fun interviewer.  No, no.  It's...  God, pulling teeth.  Oh, Steve Martin's wonderful.  Oh, why don't you die in a fucking boating accident?  All right, so...  No, it's really bad. 
[02:54:00]  But I have to get my hair cut for Little Warren Dean's christening.  So, after that, I will let you see.  Because it just looks too fucking bad right now.  Can't we see it, Missy?  No, no, no.  That's great.  No, because you know what it is?  It's all, like, greasy and under my hat and everything.  That's great.  No, it's horrid.  You have fucking...  You have drifter hair.  Yes.  I have drifter hair.  I have hobo hair.  I said hobo.  Are you the hitchhiker?  Yes.  Are you going to take us into Torrid Tales with Twists of Fate? 
[02:54:30]  I've noticed.  It's like little bristles.  It comes in.  It's amazing.  But it takes, you know...  You're really not going to be able to notice for four to six months or 30 years.  Yeah.  For, like, four to six months.  It takes a while because you implant in the follicle and then it's got to grow.  And you can't fucking force hair to grow.  Sure you can.  It just takes a while.  No, you can't.  Yell at it.  All right. 
[02:55:00]  It's like a tree.  It's all like a plant.  No.  Anthony, is it true if you can see Anthony's plugs today, we have six more weeks of winter?  No.  They're not plugs.  It was individual follicles to fill in the thinning areas.  Yes.  Anthony pops his head out.  If somebody tries to comb something, it's six more weeks of winter.  See, I noticed when I was on video and then the lights right over your head, you notice,  like, you could see a bright spot of scalp.  So I wanted that taken care of.  That's where I got the black spray paint. 
[02:55:30]  So then, no, I don't get black spray paint.  I didn't want to do the black spray paint.  So I went for a sharpie.  You just used a sharpie.  Medical hair restoration.  I didn't use a sharpie.  He's a Puerto Rican with a can of black spray paint.  Like, in taken.  A sharpie.  You draw that sharpie line in like Homer.  Yes.  You have that zigzag around.  All right, let's take a look.  Why don't you borrow Liam Neeson's wig?  Yeah.  I need a wig.  Yeah.  We don't have to see the top of your head.  I just want to, like, take your hat off.  You can even move back.  No, it really isn't because it would be a misconception. 
[02:56:00]  Because I think you have, like, some kind of weird mullet going on now because there's  different lengths of hair.  No, it's very, like, there's a lot on the sides and the back.  And then, like, on the top, it's very short.  So cut everything.  No, because I just want to get a regular haircut on the sides and the back and stuff and the  front and then leave, like, that area that was thinning because it's growing in.  I don't want to, you know, I want it to feel good about itself.  I don't want to go, ooh, now I'm going to, you know, you're just starting to sprout out. 
[02:56:30]  Now I'm going to cut you off.  But it's under a hat.  Does that make it harder for it to grow?  No, it's genetic.  It's all genetic.  And I take the hat off once I, you know, leave the studio.  There's no sunshine on your head.  Yeah.  I get in my truck and the hat goes to the passenger seat and I drive home looking silly.  Right.  I look like a madman when I yell at fucking certain ethnic people that can't drive.  You have hat head and it's greasy and matted and some of it's missing.  And I, like, try to take my fingers and pull it back and I just look like fucking Count Dracula  and I'm yelling at people.  That's fantastic. 
[02:57:00]  They're bad for plugs.  You can rip them out.  They're not plugs.  No.  I could tug on my fucking hair because it's your natural hair.  Once it's in, it's done.  It's a done deal.  It's in.  They can't come out.  It's not a wig.  It's not a fucking hair system.  It's my natural growing hair.  I could cut it, color it, do whatever I want with it.  Except touch it.  They put it in.  No.  You could do anything.  They put out his hair in like the fucking pegs in the battleship.  No.  That's not.  That's plugs.  And it's not plugs.  It's individual follicles.  It's like fiber optics. 
[02:57:30]  More than that.  Call it whatever you want to make yourself feel better.  It's okay.  No.  It's not plugs.  We're with you.  We're your pals.  You watch the commercials for it and they show you what old plugs were.  They were literally cookie cutter plugs that they pulled out of your head and just put  on top because they weren't worried about what your scalp or hairline looked like.  They hoped the hair that was growing would cover that up.  But this, you can look right down at the scalp and not even notice.  See, people think that hair replacement treatment looks bad because they've only seen bad ones. 
[02:58:00]  The good ones, you don't even notice because you don't notice it.  Because it looks natural.  That's why I went to medical hair restoration and got these thinning areas in the back of  my head filled in.  That's what they call this?  We all believe that you've got this futuristic treatment that nobody's ever heard of before.  No, it's not futuristic.  It's an improvement over the years upon the initial idea that hair can be transplanted from 
[02:58:30]  an area that is genetically engineered not to fall out to areas that genetically do get affected  with male pattern baldness.  Your method was actually one step below shaving your mustache and taping it to the area.  It was not.  It was wonderful.  Sprinkling pubes on superglue.  It took one day.  It took one day.  And then within a week, you couldn't even notice I had had anything done.  And then in time, it grows in. 
[02:59:00]  And I'm noticing it growing in.  It's not plugs.  It's not surgery.  You're not put under.  It's nothing like that.  You watch movies when it's done.  When do we get the big reveal, man?  Yeah, it's, you know, there's some discomfort occasionally, but.  Can we at least set a date for the big reveal?  Because we're all curious.  Well, after little Laurentine's christening.  I'm paying close attention there, Joe, because if it works for Ant.  You don't have a problem, do you?  I'm getting there.  Are you really?  Give me another year or two, and I'll be the guy yelling and screaming after you're not plugged. 
[02:59:30]  You know what I did do the other day?  First time ever.  I bought a hairbrush.  What's that?  I haven't combed my hair since I was 20.  I actually brushed my hair, and I haven't done that in centuries.  I just have.  Do you just brush your hair in front of, like, a big mirror?  I sit there and play the Happy Days music and use a comb, and then I just go, hey, it's good.  Wait, do you count?  One, two.  Yeah, I'm Marsha Brady, a hundred strokes.  A hundred strokes.  On my cock, you fucking fat whore. 
[03:00:00]  You blow a fan at your head so it's flowing?  Yes, I want Fabio hair.  That's what I want to grow in.  That's the way to do it.  No, I just, because hair is growing in.  I see it.  All right.  And I want to, you know, get some kind of hairstyle.  I don't know what I do.  I usually, I used to just leave it.  You see it, huh?  I would shower.  You also hear voices.  And then, the voices are real.  Oh, okay.  They're telling me the war is coming.  Why is Sam still standing there?  Sam's got hair. 
[03:00:30]  I could show you pictures, Sam.  I had hair like that.  Yeah.  So you can look forward to a great future of having follicles implanted in your head, too.  Oh, how great would Sam look with a big bald spot?  Oh, it would be great.  It doesn't happen to everyone.  I would love that.  I want to put a handlebar mustache on you.  Why?  Can we get at least a fake one for some pictures?  I guess so.  I guess so.  So you look like dear old dad.  His dad has a handlebar mustache, Joe.  Really?  For real.  That's awesome.  He's old school.  He's had it for, what, 30, 40 years?  Yes.  It doesn't reject it. 
[03:01:00]  They don't reject.  It's fine.  They're in there, and they're growing, and it's done.  It's not, like, going to pop out and reject.  It's not a kidney, fucko.  Sorry.  Had to straighten that guy's shit out.  Wait, how come your dad doesn't handlebar mustache?  I guess it's my...  He juggles at Disney.  Who the fuck else has a handlebar mustache these days?  He was a weightlifter in 1910.  Does he run a candy store?  No. 
[03:01:30]  It's a new one.  He's got to head to the list.  I'm assuming it was in style when he grew it.  It was never in style.  It might have been.  The handlebar mustache was never in style.  Those were the rebels, man.  Those were the guys just doing their thing.  In, like, the old West pictures.  That's the only time I've seen it.  Well, maybe he was, like, a younger guy, and he saw those Old West pictures, and he's  like, yeah, bad ass.  No.  Dude.  Yeah.  What, is your dad tying someone to the railroad tracks? 
[03:02:00]  Does your dad ever say, no, uh-uh?  No.  Does he demand rent from young women or old ladies?  He's not evil.  Never threaten tying to the train track.  Does he go around shutting down orphanages?  Yeah.  No.  Does he have a cape?  Does he ever pull it up over his face and walk away very snidely?  He doesn't have a cape.  No?  Or a hat.  All right.  No hat?  A little, like, stovepipe-type hat?  No, he does not.  He just has his handlebar mustache. 
[03:02:30]  He doesn't do change very well, so he grew it at one point, and then he realized if he  shaved it, it would be a change, so he didn't.  Plus, it goes really good with his monocle.  He'd have a monocle?  He has glasses.  That's good.  You know, the handlebar mustache just touches the surface as far as Sam's dad goes.  Yeah.  He drinks what?  Buttermilk?  Yeah, he drinks buttermilk.  Buttermilk?  What the?  Your father fucking is...  He took a time machine.  Wait, buttermilk, like, all day?  Well, not like all day, but he will sit down on a Sunday and have a glass of buttermilk. 
[03:03:00]  If everybody's having a glass of milk, he will have a glass of buttermilk.  What's he trying to look like, the guy on the chance cards in Monopoly?  Is he drinking buttermilk with a fucking mustache?  Well, he must have a throat-clearing nasal sinus.  Oh, shit.  Buttermilk is so...  God, gummy.  ...thick.  You're just filled with fat.  You can't get more fat snores.  Does he like putting salt in it?  No.  Does your family often gather on a Sunday afternoon for a nice glass of milk?  Buttermilk.  No.  He sits around... 
[03:03:30]  What's the other thing he does?  Stores on his back.  I went...  I had the THR out on that one, Tim.  I know how that started.  Sam was young and he went, Danny, what's that in your mustache?  And he went, how about her?  Buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  And now he has to drink it.  It wasn't buttermilk.  And then it was in his mustache, so he just twisted it up into a handlebar as an excuse.  How come every time the black gardener leaves...  Oh, God. 
[03:04:00]  I didn't have a list.  Yeah.  What else does he do?  There's one other thing that shocked me.  Sardines.  Out of the can.  Horrendous.  These are oldie things.  Jesus.  These are oldie time things.  What is he, a hobo?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got the bandana tucked at the end of a stick, waiting for a freight train.  He's a stocking pack.  He's like that Bubba and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. 
[03:04:30]  Wow, that is just amazing.  It's just, that's what he likes.  There's your dad.  There's a picture of a guy with a handlebar mustache, a monocle, and one of those Shemp Howard hairdos  that are just greased and parted in the middle.  Sam's father would have shot a man for snoring.  Just for snoring.  And the Time Live books.  Is he hoping to get money off O.J. Simpson?  No.  Oh, that's right.  But he is hoping that the same thing happens.  What?  Oh, wow. 
[03:05:00]  What the...  That's not true either.  Nice.  Aw.  Yeah, that is an oldie time look.  Well, yeah.  You've got to admit.  It's coming back, though.  No, it's not.  Are you sure?  No.  Dude, it was never...  What'd you get him for Christmas?  Spats.  When you would bring home a black girl, would your father go...  Does your dad stand with his hands on his hips?  How old school is he?  If you'd bring home a black girlfriend, would your father go, who's the belly warmer?  Is this really Sam's dad? 
[03:05:30]  Oh, shit.  What?  Sam's dad.  It probably is.  Sam's dad.  Where?  Hello?  Hello?  You're on the air, sir.  Hello?  Hi.  Oh, shit.  This is Sam's dad for real.  Do I get residuals for this or what?  Hey, what's with the mustache?  Old person.  Jesus.  What's with the mustache?  Sam's dad.  The mustache has always been there.  I was...  Way back when I started, I had a bit of an ego problem, so that was a cheap way to get it. 
[03:06:00]  And it never left.  Cheap way to get what?  Like an ego?  An ego, sure.  You look important when you have a handlebar mustache.  Wow, he's got to be someone.  Really?  Yeah.  In what year, though?  I mean...  What year?  Yeah, it's like that's...  You might as well just shave it into a Hitler.  This was in the mid-60s.  Mid-60s, it probably really didn't go.  Like, there were hippies and...  You wouldn't believe the action I got in the mid-60s. 
[03:06:30]  What?  With the handlebar mustache?  With the handlebar mustache?  Including, you might be interested to know, Sam's mother.  Oh, Sam!  Oh, come on!  Damn!  That's awful.  Sam, your dad got action with the handlebar mustache.  How does that make you feel?  Awkward and uncomfortable.  Oh, God, I can only imagine in the mid-60s what that must have looked like.  It looked like two Bigfoot fighting.  It's kind of similar to the action that Sam gets with his hair now, right?  Oh, see?  Oh, a little, uh, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  People think I'm important because I got a unique hairstyle.  Did your dad ever tell you, like, Dad, could you shave the mustache, Sam?  If it wasn't for this mustache, you wouldn't be here.  Yeah.  Right now.  This is how it all happened.  Your mom liked this mustache.  Hey, Sam's dad, what's up with the buttermilk?  Listen, you guys don't understand.  Buttermilk is one of the great treats of all time.  Who drinks buttermilk?  I don't even know where you're fucking.  When I started as a kid, I used to drink buttermilk with crumbled up saltine crackers. 
[03:07:30]  Holy mother of God!  It is a great treat.  So the best lunch in the world, which Sam has probably already done me in on already, I'm sure,  is sardines with a dill pickle, glass of buttermilk on bread, and it doesn't get much better.  And a little view into the Nickelodeon!  How bad are your farts, Sam?  Oh, wow.  Buttermilk.  Imagine if he was lactose intolerant, too. 
[03:08:00]  Buttermilk, sardines, pickles, and what?  He's shitting, and the sardines are just swimming upstream back up his asshole like salmon.  It's the buttermilk, it's the leopard, there's no issue of fat, there's no issue of calories,  there's none of that stuff, it's just great stuff.  We got a picture of Sam's dad's bike up on there.  That's not my dad, he's got a big screen, no.  The huge wheel up front, the little one in the back.  We don't have a bike like that in my house, no?  I got nervous that he was calling to challenge one of us to a duel. 
[03:08:30]  That's where I got eating raw potatoes from.  What, you guys eat raw potatoes at your house, too?  He told me that was another one of the great treats of all time.  Great treats of all time.  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the great treats of all time.  Why is that a great treat?  Your father's a newsreel.  Yeah.  To make the phone call into the show, he had to crank his phone  and get the operator to plug that jack into the wall.  Operator, get me Murray Hill 5-6262. 
[03:09:00]  That's Murray Hill 5-6262.  Yes.  Sir, sir, I didn't have time to listen to the news today.  What did Walter Winchell have to say?  What did he dish about Hollywood this morning?  All I'm trying to do, and there are a few of us around  that are trying to maintain standards, even bring some back,  but no, no, we have to be the butt of this sort of tawdry humor.  I don't think that one's going to catch on, though.  It's one of those things that kind of is just in history  and kind of remains there, like the Hitler mustache. 
[03:09:30]  It's a man of great class has a handlebar mustache.  That's true.  And here are our brave doughboys sipping off for Europe.  Does your mom like the handlebar mustache, Sam?  They'll beat the Kaiser.  I think...  What does mom think of the mustache?  I think she likes the mustache like my girlfriend likes my afro  in that it's just been there for so long at this point.  Yeah.  She puts up with it.  She's trying to hire Joaquin Phoenix to take it off  like Nicole Kidman did.  Matt Dillon.  Too obscure. 
[03:10:00]  Get it?  All right, Sam.  Listen, yeah, I have to go.  I have important things to do.  Drinking buttermilk, eating potatoes, sardines, pickles.  How much is mustache wax?  Actually, I don't use mustache wax anymore.  What do you use?  It's just natural.  It's not.  Buttermilk.  I used to, but that was a long time ago.  Do you have to leave now?  Are you running some bootlegged liquor?  Okay.  Listen.  All right, Sam's dad. 
[03:10:30]  You guys get back to more moral uplift there.  Oh!  Oh!  Damn.  We'll see you.  Just take it easy.  All right.  Sam's dad, everyone.  Great.  Boy, he's a big smartass like you, huh?  You got called out on that one.  What, did he have to tend to the still?  Everything Sam's dad does is in fast motion.  Is he going to beat you with a stitch?  I bet everything, you know, the most modern camera, when you take pictures of him, it's 
[03:11:00]  just all grainy.  I was about to.  It's got scratches in it.  Like a brand new camera.  He's all in fast motion with grainy scratches.  I was trying to work some grainy joke I couldn't get to.  Think, think, think.  His dad is the only digital camera that you need to throw like a little cape over yourself.  He's got all that big thing.  Big thing of gunpowder.  Now, remember, hold still.  Here we are with Sam's father in Times Square.  It's victory over Europe day.  Now, if we can only defeat the Japs. 
[03:11:30]  That shouldn't take too long.  Here he is making out with Sam's mother.  I wonder if a little Sam will be made today.  This conversation is ridiculous because if you weren't here, he wouldn't know.  Can we bring in all that stuff for tomorrow's show and make E-Rock eat sardines, drink buttermilk,  tickles, and mustache wax, tickles, and raw potatoes.  Why can't you?  What?  Oh, fuck you.  What'd he say? 
[03:12:00]  Here he goes, I can't.  I started a diet Monday.  Really?  He's on Steve's girl's diet.  Fuck that.  The diet will be very easy to keep with no employment.  So you won't be able to buy sex.  Dude, you have to eat Sam's dad's snack, which is...  Which is, what did he call him?  Some of the greatest treats the world has ever seen.  Treats the world has ever seen.  We're doing it tomorrow on the show.  Sardines, pickles, buttermilk, and raw potatoes?  Raw potato and some nice saltine crackers sprinkled in the milk. 
[03:12:30]  In the milk?  In the buttermilk.  Yes, in the buttermilk.  That's not a great treat.  That's what he takes with him when he takes his snake oil wagon on the road.  What did he do for New Year's Eve?  Zip his ball bag up and his zipper on purpose?  One of the greatest treats the world ever knows.  Sometimes I just need to feel good.  A bit lighter by his penis.  Oh, shit.  Who's going to remember this for tomorrow?  I will.  E-Rock, you have to do this tomorrow.  Of course he does.  Did you ever catch him coming down for buttermilk with a little candle in that little thing you hold with your finger and the stocking cap? 
[03:13:00]  Did he tell you stories about Jacob Marley?  Your dad acts like it's the 1800s.  It's a simpler time.  Well, he wasn't even alive.  From everything.  He's like, his snacks.  No.  His snacks and his mustache.  He's a history buff.  And so I think he just...  Is he?  Yeah.  He kind of gets into that whole thing?  He just fell into a simpler time.  A simpler time.  We line up this shit tomorrow. 
[03:13:30]  It's going to...  Oh, horrific.  Fucking buttermilk with saltines crushed in it.  With saltines crushed in it.  It's like everything that shouldn't be mixed is mixed.  And he eats all this at the same time?  Yeah, that's a meal.  That is a meal that you give, like, orphans in the little rascals.  Orphans?  That's when they're trying to get away.  Your dog wouldn't even eat that.  Don't drink the milk.  It's spoiled.  He tried to sell my girlfriend on what a treat buttermilk was.  And I was over there going, yeah, it's really good.  You should try some.  Why are you trying to do that?  You know what that would do to a girl?  The next day, she'd be fucking huge. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, she's having awful gassers.  She tried a sip and didn't enjoy it.  No?  No.  Did you try it with the crackers in it?  No, we didn't put any...  Maybe that was a problem.  Oh, well, it's not the best treat the world has ever known if you don't put crackers in it.  How thick is the buttermilk?  It's like...  How thick is it?  Is it like egg whites or quichsand?  It has to be.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's probably twice as thick as whole milk.  Ugh.  Fucking buttermilk is horrible.  The thought of that is making me feel like one guy.  Like, when I was watching that, like, it's making me like that, like, ugh. 
[03:14:30]  Fucking...  A raw potato?  Yeah, those are good.  They're not good.  They're not starchy fucking messes.  If you want a treat like that, eat an apple.  At least it's sweet.  It's got the same, like, kind of consistency, almost.  Who's he raised by?  Wolves?  His father was raised by wolves.  The buttermilk with the crackers tastes like the nipple milk of a wolf.  How do you eat a raw potato?  Like, how do you...  What do you do with it?  Well, you could slice it up or not.  You don't need to.  Like in chips?  Like chips?  Yeah, you just... 
[03:15:00]  You could...  But you don't have to.  Do you skin it?  Yeah, you definitely skin it.  You skin it, you watch it.  Oh, well, that's crazy not to, of course.  Now...  Salt it?  What, are you insane at it?  Yeah, you put some salt on it.  Yeah.  What are you dipping in?  Vodka?  What the fuck's the matter?  No, you just, you know...  It's crazy.  Cold water, so it's nice and chilled.  And put some salt on it, and you just take a bite of a potato.  And then you and Dad sit down.  Potato.  Eating some, you know, raw potatoes.  Watch Mary Pickford in her latest picture.  America's Sweetheart!  No talkies allowed in that house.  I wish you'd pull a fatty Arbuckle with your asshole. 
[03:15:30]  With a bottle?  Yes, the old Coke bottle.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, he pig-socked that cunt.  He sure did.  She had it coming.  Yes, she did.  You want to fuck the funny man?  Take the punishment.  That's what you get, toots.  Handlebar asshole.  Let's get the fake handlebar mustache for tomorrow's bit.  Okay.  Sam, you're in charge of this.  And E-Rock, you're doing this, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  No, look, he's all upset.  Now he's got an excuse. 
[03:16:00]  He's going to eat like a fucking pig tonight.  Because tomorrow he's going to do this.  You can puke it up after you're done.  You just started yesterday.  You can stick fingers down.  You're not going to swallow this stuff.  It's coming back up.  I don't think you'll puke.  Sardines, buttermilk, pickles.  Are you kidding me?  Who the hell?  Who could eat like that?  What else is old Iron Stomach like?  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  He's one of those guys that can just probably drink a lot without puking.  He's one of those guys that just has an Iron Stomach. 
[03:16:30]  Nothing probably bothers him.  Does he like to drink a little bit?  No, he did at a time.  He doesn't anymore.  Oh, so he quit.  At a time.  What did he drink?  I mean, he drinks beer now.  But not like...  He gets drunk once.  I've seen him drunk once.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Does he go smack you around?  Yeah, but he puts Sam in the hospital.  He went up in jail for three weeks.  A couple of extra foot pounds per second per second.  I literally have one little afro hair on his fucking little head.  Is his favorite drink sarsaparilla?  Yeah. 
[03:17:00]  I like birch beer.  That's a good tonic.  That's a good tonic.  Oh, get me some of those headache powders.  All right.  We got a bit for tomorrow.  We got to take a quick break.  All righty.  We promised the Christian Bale on that.  Yay!  So quick break, and we'll do that to wrap this mess up.  All right?  I forgot to mention, I'll be at Caroline's this week, Thursday through Sunday.  All right.  Hmm.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  I just checked the mousetraps.  Nothing, Ant.  Nothing.  That's all right.  It's like fishing.  You got to be patient.  I don't think we're going to have a win today, but I think tomorrow we're going to open up  the show with some nice results.  Yeah.  I have confidence.  Make sure those things are on, and they got new batteries in them.  And we'll be frying some mice sometime between now and tomorrow morning.  But he's not going to be happy.  Fuck him.  Screw him.  I wish he'd walk in here right now.  Why don't you stick around and really... 
[03:18:00]  I'll tell him about a thing or two.  Why don't you speak your mind today and, you know, hang around, wait for him to show up.  Do you realize when you tell me to hang around that it's just, it's so never going to happen?  You might as well tell Anthony just to hover in midair like a bird.  Yeah.  I can't wait for tomorrow's show.  What is it called again?  The treat...  The greatest treat the world has ever known.  The greatest treat.  One of the world's greatest treats.  One of the world's greatest treats.  They're fucking horrendous treats.  I was saying they're...  Not treats.  They're awful things.  They're punishments. 
[03:18:30]  Yes.  Jimmy, you might be able to help me out.  I was saying during the commercial, that could be the worst combination of food and beverage  I've ever heard of.  It's crap.  As far as treats go, I'd rather have castor oil and be raped with a cheerleading baton  than fucking buttermilk with crushed crackers in it.  The world's greatest treats.  Yeah.  What's the point of the crackers?  I don't even know what she's saying.  I don't know.  Give it some fucking viscosity.  It's already like a gooey mess.  Yeah.  That's like deer snot.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Hey, you want to see...  Make it lumpy. 
[03:19:00]  That's what you want.  Wow.  Buttermilk isn't bad enough.  I want to make it lumpy.  I've heard of crackers and milk.  No.  He gave that to a baby.  No.  No.  People smash up crackers in the milk and get it to the babies.  No.  Stop.  That's probably should have a baby belief.  You've got to see you side, Dave.  He just completely took me out of our conversation.  Yeah.  I haven't seen him yet.  It's annoying me that he won't poke his head in.  No.  He's being all fucking uppity.  The one of Fez beard bid is over, right?  Who won, by the way?  I didn't get to listen to the end of the show.  Round one was just weighing the beard hair.  Right.  And I believe Fezzy won that one. 
[03:19:30]  All right.  And then they had round two where they shaved their heads and added it in.  And Dave won that one.  You know what?  It doesn't look that bad.  I told it it was okay.  It doesn't look that bad.  You look odd.  I wanted to beat you up, but it doesn't look that bad.  I'm so used to seeing you the other way that that kind of looks weird.  There was such curly locks.  Yeah.  Rolf has noon to three.  No, this is terrible.  This is the worst look that's happened to me ever.  No beard and no hair on the top of your head.  They said you kind of look like the powder dude.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Only fatter. 
[03:20:00]  Worst complexion.  Farts too much.  The people on the bus.  I ride the same bus every day, and it's the same exact people.  And usually people don't sit next to me because of the beard.  Yeah.  Now people are not even sitting next to me, in front of me, or behind me because of the  crazy-ass fucking psycho neo-Nazi look I've got going right now.  I have a really good skinhead look to you.  Yeah.  I mean, no one's going near me at this point.  That's convenient.  It's convenient.  I can stretch out.  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  I can use basically the whole back of the bus as mine.  It's for you.  It's not that bad.  It's horrible.  He did the same thing?  And I'll tell you what.  It magnifies.  I've never lost the weight from the biggest gainer contest.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony, for making me a fatso.  It never.  I went from 195, spelt.  You are a little skinny kid.  How old, sir?  David.  What's up?  I went from 195 to 216.  Haven't dropped an ounce, Jimmy.  Why didn't you shave the eyebrows, too?  I mean, that's the...  Wow.  It's about the whole time.  That would really be fucked up.  It wasn't in the contest. 
[03:21:00]  If it could have helped my beard results, it would have, because I was about .5 an ounce  away from Fez.  How much did the beard hair weigh?  It was...  He had .411 of an ounce.  I had .36 of an ounce.  Whose pot scale did he use?  Yeah, someone's drug scale.  I had Pepper Hicks, who was a known drug owner.  He was a known drug owner.  I want to ask Dave the Plumber.  Do you think you're that? 
[03:21:30]  Dave the Plumber.  You really do.  You used to be like a skinny kid when you first started here, and I make it sound like...  And there he was, up on the team.  Yes.  Signing autographs.  Ugh.  What happened?  I remember Jim Norton used to refer to me as that svelte redhead intern.  Yes, yes.  I wasn't being paid.  But it wasn't that long ago.  It was three years ago.  It was three years ago.  It was three years ago.  But so much has happened to you.  I have two kids.  You have two kids, a wife, you're fine.  I'm fat.  And let's face it, my alcohol problem continues to spiral downward. 
[03:22:00]  Can I cup a fart and throw it to you?  Yeah, please.  Can I ask you a question?  I don't do any more stunts.  No.  No stunts?  No stunts?  Yeah, he's not allowed to do stunts.  I'm retired from stunts.  Ronnie gets very upset when he does stunts on our show.  This time is bad.  Oh, shit.  It knocked him down.  Jimmy, your fart fucking knocked it down.  Jimmy cupped that perfectly, by the way.  He grabbed it in his hand, left enough space for the fart, and then slowly just wafted it 
[03:22:30]  under Dave's nose.  Eating from Malgahite sandwiches?  It was a perfect delivery.  It is the way Obi-Wan Kenobi would have done it.  Yes, it was like a force push.  He fucking went right to the floor.  You hear about Sam's dad and his little treat.  What is it called again?  I want to say it every time, but I can't.  The greatest treat the world has ever seen.  One of the world's greatest treats.  Did you hear this yet?  No.  Tomorrow, E-Rock's got to do Sam's father's treat.  Basically, Sam's father eats sardines.  Yeah.  Drinks buttermilk with what? 
[03:23:00]  Cracker saltines ground up in the buttermilk.  And pickles.  And pickles.  And raw potatoes.  And raw potatoes.  And he shakes it with gasoline.  So, E-Rock's got to eat that tomorrow on the show.  That's fantastic.  Not as good as Beard Wars, I understand.  But, you know.  He eats like he's one of the Wolverines in Red Dog.  Whatever you can get.  Joe had a question for you, Eastside.  I just want to know,  why did you decide to not do another season on The Shield?  Oh, golly damn. 
[03:23:30]  Wow.  Golly.  Ouch.  You're going to hear a lot of those in the coming days.  Now Dave has had it.  Now he's fucking leaving.  Really?  No.  All right.  Later.  Wow.  Look at that body.  One of the three.  There you go.  That is.  He could not be more Irish.  You are so fucking Irish.  Dude, for a poor.  What are you doing?  For a poor guy,  you sure know how to find food.  He does.  He's not old.  And his belly is like fucking.  He's got like the body of. 
[03:24:00]  Dave, no stunts.  No stunts.  Yeah, no stunts.  That's close to stunting right there.  You don't want Ronnie mad.  He has a body like a fucking,  like a ghost.  It's just hanging.  He's got like hanging stuff on him.  You guys want to hear a curse on regular TV?  Yes.  That's quick.  These guys did something that was so stupid.  So let's bonus them.  Let's not bonus them.  Bonus them.  By the way,  he's playing devils out. 
[03:24:30]  You know,  but here's the thing.  I got to go.  The bonus,  the bonus question,  we shouldn't be talking about.  Exactly.  It's a stupid.  It's a stupid debate.  Wow.  You're agreeing.  We're leaving it there.  You're agreeing.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  You can't put me on the show.  Thank you, Charlie.  I'm sorry.  Charlie's agreeing.  Hello, YouTube.  Yikes.  Here we go.  It's my fault.  Okay.  Where do we know?  Let's see.  You know why the guy was quick to apologize?  I'm sorry. 
[03:25:00]  I'm sorry.  Because usually they're so scared.  They show these.  No,  they show these guys the door never to return.  Yeah.  I know.  What was that?  What did he say?  He's fucked?  Yeah.  Where was that?  What was it?  CNBC?  He said,  yeah,  he said,  he said it was a stupid fucking question,  but he caught himself,  but the end was already out.  He was just like,  stupid fucking fuck.  Was it?  I mean,  what show was it?  I don't know what show,  but it was CNBC's Charlie Gasparino.  No one watches that.  That's a huge show.  Charlie Gasparino. 
[03:25:30]  Wow.  All right.  Christian Bale.  Yeah,  we're going to play this as we leave today,  because the story obviously has legs.  All the news stations are playing it with the beeps,  so we played it earlier with the beeps  because we were on the other side,  so we'll play it with all the curses of flying for everybody  so you get a nice taste of this.  And we'll see y'all tomorrow.  Yeah,  I think we did everything we need to do.  Tomorrow,  we'll get an update on the mice,  and we'll do the,  God,  Ann,  I need your help again.  The greatest, 
[03:26:00]  what is it?  Sam knows.  Some of the greatest treats the world has known?  But they're really not.  It's something like that.  I can't wait till we,  I'll pull the audio and find it.  That shit put it into perspective,  though,  when he tells people he has one of the brightest suns.  And what his thinking is.  Yeah.  So we can make the sun shine.  Just sing that song.  Sam,  make sure there's no other treats that he's forgetting.  If he remembers some more treats,  bring him in for tomorrow.  Oh,  yes,  absolutely.  Talk to him.  This is one of the greatest colognes the world has ever seen,  is dog shit. 
[03:26:30]  Oh,  Sam.  I have a feeling,  no wonder you're like you are.  I have a feeling,  though,  Sam's dad has a bad side.  We haven't hit it yet,  but I don't know.  What kind of a bad side?  I don't know.  I have a feeling he could go  at any moment.  Yeah?  Oh,  yeah.  Like mean?  I don't know if he would be called mean,  but I don't know.  I'll listen to that.  Joe DeRosa,  Comedy Central,  1030 Friday night,  the big special.  Yes,  sir.  That's very good news for you, 
[03:27:00]  my friend.  Thank you,  man.  I hope everybody watches or Tivo's it or DVR's it.  And we love you on the show.  Thanks,  man.  I love being here.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  I'm speaking for a lot of people.  They really like you on the show.  Awesome,  man.  Thanks.  And Jimmy's got a lot of things going on.  I have Caroline's this weekend.  I have a gig with Artie February 21st in Philadelphia at the Tower Theater.  But more importantly,  I have Caroline's this weekend.  So if you happen to be in town,  you know,  hey,  get out. 
[03:27:30]  Good club.  Good fucking entertainment.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  I have a whole special thing I do with animals.  I thought it was like a song and dance thing.  No,  that's the Thursday show.  Friday,  I do the animals.  It's impressions,  I think.  Now you do an animal show?  I do.  I do a lot of impressions.  Cool.  It is.  It's many impressions.  Yeah.  And the animals.  It's funny.  You can't wait.  Yeah.  I have fleas.  I bring fleas on stage.  Flea circus.  You should do flea circus.  Yes.  Got your old Mr. Jangle. 
[03:28:00]  That's stupid.  And I have a small dove I bring on stage and I hurt it.  What if I hurt it with a pin?  Ow!  Oh,  that would hurt a little dove.  It's a little dove face.  I wouldn't kill him,  but it would really hurt.  I nail its little dove feet to the stage with a pin.  I got racial epithets at it.  You got to work sea monkeys into your show.  I actually had sea monkeys in a...  Someone's got to bring back the sea monkey.  I had them in like a little jar,  and I shook it up violently  so there were pieces of sea monkey. 
[03:28:30]  They're all knocked out.  No,  I shook the sea monkeys violently in the jar  until they busted apart.  Shooka,  shooka.  All right.  Disappointing sea monkeys.  That's what you're supposed to do with a sea monkey.  Fucking brined shrimp.  And I have a kit and I bring up in a...  Don't shit me,  they don't play.  I have a kit and I bring up in a box.  Yeah?  And I have a contest.  How hard can I throw a rock at it?  It's me against me.  I hope you win.  Sam's back with a Sam's Dad update.  Oh,  okay.  We got one of the treats wrong.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  The sardines are eaten in a sandwich 
[03:29:00]  which apparently he puts  thick slices of tarp  or thick slices of strong onion  on the sardine sandwich.  Oh,  wow.  He hates your mother.  He wants to do things  that make him...  His breath is where you cannot speak to him.  Wow.  I have to say,  I think I finally feel sorry for E-Rogg.  He's going to eat this tomorrow.  What kind of bread?  What kind of bread?  Can you eat a...  He's got the facial hair  and breath of a walrus. 
[03:29:30]  Can you eat...  He likes fish that are thrown to him.  E-Rogg,  do you think you could  muster down a sardine sandwich  with strong onions?  Thickly sliced.  Thickly sliced.  Oh, God.  Anything else on that?  No,  I mean,  no.  No condiments or anything?  Any lubricants?  Well,  the buttermilk is the lubricant.  That's way easier.  You wash it down  with some buttermilk.  That's way easier,  dude.  Seriously.  On bread and everything.  That's way easier  than just eating those fuckers 
[03:30:00]  right out of the can.  Oh, really?  You have to drink the juice, though.  You have to drink the oil.  Yeah.  As soon as you bite into the bread,  you think you're biting into  a nice sandwich  and then you get to the sardines.  I would challenge you  and say it's worse.  I like sardines, too, actually.  I couldn't eat them with buttermilk.  What?  I've always enjoyed it.  I was a boy.  My grandmother  liked sardines and crackers.  Saltines and sardines.  Called Sardine Jimmy.  So you'll eat some  of the sardines tomorrow?  Nah,  I don't eat them anymore  because they're too fatty.  No.  Because I would do  magic tricks with them.  So when it gets all dry, 
[03:30:30]  I would yell ta-da  and then step on them.  So when this whole thing  gets dry and uncomfortable  for Iroch,  he gets to wash it down  with the buttermilk.  Oh, with some creamy buttermilk  with saltines  smashed up in there.  Jesus Christ.  Like a billy goat.  That's what a billy goat eats.  And you got the pickle.  And the pickles.  A dill pickle.  The dill pickle  might be very inviting  tomorrow for you.  Yeah, that's like  the real treat.  You're like,  thank God I got to the  dill pickle  to get this  shitty taste  out of my mouth. 
[03:31:00]  Dill pickle chaser.  Oh, God.  Again.  Oh, my God.  Again.  Big slice of onions.  I would rather eat  Star Jones' cunt.  Oh, my God.  Smell worse.  Wow.  That's actually  very similar.  Except it's chocolate milk,  not buttermilk.  Iraq,  if you behave,  you can wash it down  with some garlic butter salt  when you're done.  When you're done, though.  One of the greatest treats  the world has ever known  or something like that.  I'm going to say that 
[03:31:30]  all night.  One of the greatest treats  the world has ever seen.  The world's greatest treats.  We have to replay  how he said it.  One of the world's greatest.  I know, the way he worded it  was perfect.  Because he meant it.  He wasn't trying to be funny.  Of course he meant it.  God, your father  in one phone call  gave us way more  entertainment than you ever have.  Ever.  Ever.  Come on.  Ever.  Yeah.  I've done some stuff.  Three plus years  and I took one call  from Sam's dad.  Look at all that  Your dad was like  being raised by  Willy Wonka.  A land of wonder  and truth.  That's right. 
[03:32:00]  The snozzberries  taste like sardines.  Sam is half white  half Opa.  Oh, man.  I can't wait for him.  I know.  I've got to see  if I can't eat this shit.  Poor fucking hero.  We're going to leave you  with the Christian Bale audio.  Yes, let's do that.  With all the curses  for everybody, okay?  Without us commenting  because we already  commented about this.  So we just play  for everybody.  Yeah, it's enjoyable.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for listening.  Later.  Thanks, man. 
[03:32:30]  I want you off  the fucking set,  you prick.  Sorry.  No, don't just be sorry.  Think for one fucking second.  The fuck are you doing?  Are you professional or not?  Yes, I am.  Do I fucking walk around  and rip that?  No, shut the fuck up, Bruce.  Do I want?  No, no, don't shut me up.  Am I going to walk around  and rip your fucking lights down  in the middle of a scene?  Then why the fuck  are you walking right through  like this in the background? 
[03:33:00]  What the fuck is it with you?  What don't you fucking understand?  You got any fucking idea  about, hey,  it's fucking distracting  having somebody walking up  behind Bryce  in the middle of the fucking scene?  Give me a fucking answer.  What don't you get about it?  I was looking at the light.  Oh, good for you.  And how was it?  I hope it was fucking good 
[03:33:30]  because it's useless now, isn't it?  Fuck's sake, man, you're amateur.  Look, G,  you got fucking something  to say to this prick?  I didn't see it happen.  Well, somebody should be fucking watching  and keeping an eye on him.  Fair enough.  There's a second time  that he doesn't give a fuck  about what is going on  in front of the camera.  Right.  All right?  I'm trying to fucking do a scene here  and I'm going,  why the fuck is Shane walking in there?  What is he doing there?  Do you understand?  My mind is not in the scene 
[03:34:00]  if you're doing that.  Stay off the fucking set, man.  For fuck's sake.  Right, let's go again.  Let's not take a fucking minute.  Let's go again.  And let's not have you  fucking walking in.  Can I have Tom put this on, please?  Yeah, Tom Wardrobe, please.  Can I have Tom Wardrobe?  You're unbelievable, man.  You're un-fucking-believable.  Number of times  you're strolling a fucking round 
[03:34:30]  in the background.  I've never had a DP  behave like this.  Ah, you don't fucking understand  what it's like working with actors.  That's what that is.  No, that's not.  That's what that is, man.  I'm telling you.  I'm not asking.  I'm telling you.  You wouldn't have done that otherwise.  No, what it is is looking at the lighting  and making sure that you were...  I want to fucking kick your fucking ass.  You know, shut up for a second, all right?  Christian, I'm good.  It's full.  I'm going to go.  Do you want me to go fucking trash your lights? 
[03:35:00]  Do you want me to fucking trash them?  Then why are you trashing my scene?  I'm not trying to be trashed.  You are trashing my scene.  You do it one more fucking time  and I ain't walking on this set  if you're still hired.  I'm fucking serious.  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice guy.  But I don't fucking cut it  when you're bullshitting him  fucking around like this on set.  Yeah, you might get it.  He doesn't fucking get it.  I get it.  You might.  I get it.  He does not get it. 
[03:35:30]  Good adjustments, okay?  For real.  Honestly, I get it.  Walk for five seconds.  No, I don't need any fucking walking.  He needs to stop walking.  I get that.  I ain't the one walking.  Let's get Tom and put this back on.  Let's go again.  Seriously, man.  You and me,  we're fucking done professionally. </pre>
