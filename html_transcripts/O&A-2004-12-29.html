<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a sexually suggestive song, immediately followed by a discussion of a large FCC fine stemming from a previous sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Technical difficulties with Opie's headphones provided extended comedic relief before they were eventually removed. The conversation then turned to the recent tsunami, featuring graphic descriptions of the devastation and a critique of the media’s perceived focus on white victims.  This led to a comparison between the public outcry over Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction and the apparent lack of outrage over the tsunami’s graphic imagery.  Callers, including "Mudflap the Trucker," shared their perspectives on the tsunami, its impact, the inadequacy of early warning systems, and the government's response, which was criticized as "stingy." The hosts then discussed their difficult co-worker, "Lady Di," and her erratic behavior, including a police call over a hidden box of wine, punctuated by numerous expletives and sexually charged humor. The segment concluded with further tsunami discussion, a satirical song about political figures, XM Radio promotion, and a mention of "Bernie Getz," the subway vigilante.

The show continued with reminiscences about a caller, "David from Irvington" (described with racial slurs), known for his controversial attacks on politicians. This segued into a discussion of Bob Grant, a controversial radio host, and a story about a guest who threatened a sexual act after describing a gay bashing, resulting in a vulgar and homophobic exchange. The conversation included Grant's firing from ABC for insensitive comments about Ron Brown's death. The hosts recounted meeting Grant and his use of offensive nicknames for politicians like Jim McGreevey.  A significant portion focused on the hosts' attempt to get their street reporter, Eric ("Hawk"), onto a live television broadcast in Times Square with provocative signs ("Opie and Anthony's shit dick," "Where's Chester?"). Technical difficulties prevented them from monitoring the broadcast, forcing reliance on Eric and a listener, Lou, for updates.  A pre-recorded, incoherent interview with Bernard Goetz provided comedic fodder.  The broadcast included XM Satellite Radio commercials, discussion of past successes (Times Square billboard, New Year's Eve appearance), and a listener-submitted toy set with sexually suggestive packaging. Studio guest Rich Vos participated in numerous personal anecdotes filled with crude humor and offensive language. The "assault on the media" ultimately failed but yielded comedic moments from Eric's reports. The segment concluded with continued vulgar language, offensive jokes, and sexually explicit humor.

The next segment started with a discussion of a previous failed "media assault," involving a woman flashing her breasts and a poorly visible sign.  This transitioned into anti-Semitic jokes about the Diamond District and Hasidic Jews, then to Opie’s potential engagement and a perceived slight by a colleague attending the Oscars instead of him.  Audio clips from Martini Steve, featuring Phil Anselmo expressing raw emotion and blaming the heavy metal media for Pantera's breakup and Dimebag Darrell's death, were played and discussed. Audio of New Jersey’s acting governor's wife, Mary Jo Cody, revealing disturbing thoughts about harming her baby, was also played, eliciting shock and humor from the hosts.  The segment highlighted a successful "media assault" by Eric, featuring Opie and Anthony's "WOW" signs on Good Morning America.  This was followed by listener-submitted "F.U." messages, a comedic musical version of *Silence of the Lambs*, and a 1970s public service announcement about LSD featuring a talking hot dog.

A listener-made "Shit Dick" sign above "Opie Anthony XM" caused a stir in the studio, leading to the playing of a song with the same title from Panzerfaust Records. The sign and song offended employees from the Broadway Channel, resulting in an argument about the studio's decor (nude pictures, etc.). Opie and Anthony defended their studio as an artistic expression, not a "workplace."  They recounted mistakenly trashing DVDs from the Sinclair Intimacy Institute, leading to a surprising advertising relationship. The segment concluded with discussion of the sign, interactions with XM employees, and a humorous call about a midget at Starbucks. Rich Vos remained as a studio guest.


A segment featuring martial artist Master Paul and comedian Rich Voss began with discussions of Voss avoiding physical greetings from a coworker. This led to Master Paul demonstrating impressive speed and dexterity in increasingly absurd challenges with Voss, featuring slaps, punches (that missed), and stomach taps. The hosts and Master Paul made frequent crude jokes, including homophobic slurs.  A listener-submitted audio clip titled "The First Gay Retarded Porno," a poorly-acted, sexually explicit Christopher Walken impression, was played, eliciting largely negative reactions. The final portion featured listener calls, often crude and humorous, and a job applicant, Jake, with an exaggerated account of his driving experience, leading to a scheduled job interview. Throughout, the hosts used offensive and vulgar language in a consistently irreverent and comedic tone.

[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  It's Opie and Anthony and we're back live in New York.  Pay attention, they spark controversy.  Fuck you!  Being able to do the show we want to do.  Hold on tight, kid.  Jesus fucking Christ!  One of the biggest fines in FCC history has slapped against Opie and Anthony.  You've got a couple of great guys over there.  Opie and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money. 
[00:07:00]  Yay, bitch!  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls violate...  What kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:07:30]  V.O.B. and Anthony's show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication is that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay, don't worry.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work. 
[00:08:00]  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay?  The medications don't work.  Let's go back and get instructions.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Okay.  Nothing works here.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Hello?  Hello?  This thing on?  Hello?  Hello?  I want my $2!  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Warning! 
[00:08:30]  Warning!  C-Word alert!  C-Word alert!  Warning!  Warning!  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  The phone lines are going berserk!  God damn it!  Are you fucking with me?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hello?  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:09:00]  I know what you're going to say already.  Oh boy.  Not good, right?  It ain't working.  Hey, how you doing, Opie?  Why are you yelling?  Because I can't hear a thing in my head.  I can't hear me.  At all.  It's, it's...  Then he's going to lose his mind.  Throw something.  This is bizarre.  And I knew this was going to happen because every morning you have a problem with your volume. 
[00:09:30]  You're not sure if you're sounding low on the show or if it's just in your headphones or maybe just in your imagination.  You know what you need?  So Mars thought he would fix the problem for you and he said what he did as we're in the office getting ready for the show.  And I looked at you like, oh boy.  It's not what it is.  Nothing against Mars, but I just know that, you know, something else would be a problem now.  Here's the problem.  Everyone else sounds fine and dandy most days on this show through my headphones. 
[00:10:00]  When I talk, it sounds like my mic's off.  I can't hear me in my headphones.  So I ask Opie to push my level up a little bit on the mixing board and then I hear myself fine.  For some reason, my level has to be higher than everyone else's on the board for me to hear my voice equally in my headphones.  Because you have a bigger ego.  You would think that if it was anyone else on this program, but not me.  I'm not like that.  So now, now it's just complete disaster because everyone else is pretty low, but I can kind of hear you and me. 
[00:10:30]  That's why I'm talking.  I'm going to be talking like this at the end of the show because I can't hear me.  Oh, really?  Like Deffy.  I'll be like Deffy.  I can't hear me.  Now, what am I going to do?  You know what you need in the radio world through your headphones?  Consistency on a day-to-day basis.  You get used to something and you deal with it.  This is just different every day.  It's changing.  Yeah, when it's something that you're not used to, it just throws you off.  Now I'm completely thrown.  You can't imagine what this sounds like. 
[00:11:00]  You should put this on and talk through it and see what it sounds like.  Because I know you like really loud headphones.  Check that out.  I might as well leave them off because now I'm talking normal.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  That's a full blast, Opie.  Holy S.  That would drive me nuts.  Say hi, Jim.  Hi, how are you?  See, to everyone in radio land, they have no idea.  It's fine.  Because I'm sure everyone's levels are pretty much equal.  But when you put your headphones on, it is really distracting.  You're way in the distance. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Was anybody else using your headphones?  I don't think so.  No, no, no, no, no.  Okay.  Mars thought he knew what the problem was.  How long does that take to, like, disable that thing you put on there?  A minute.  A minute.  All right.  Well.  He's sliding under there like a mechanic.  Oh, brother.  Oh, boy.  Now I got none.  Oh, jeez.  Okay.  That'll work.  I'll just take these off.  There we go.  That's better.  Now I'll just talk like a human fucking being without any headphones on.  Yeah.  Why do we even use headphones?  I don't know.  You don't go walking through life with headphones on. 
[00:12:00]  I think, honestly, we could all just do the show like this.  Wouldn't that be good?  You know what?  You're only wearing the headphones pretty much for phone callers and sound clips and stuff  like that.  Because someone that started doing radio a long time ago said, no, you need headphones.  So we all wear headphones when we're doing a radio show.  So you can hear the Pink Floyd music you're playing, man, and it's groovy, and you're not  listening to other people in the studio.  But my headphones are off, yours are off, and we're having a normal conversation.  Screw it.  Like we would do if we went to lunch together or something. 
[00:12:30]  We're going to just walk around with headphones all the time and pop them on.  Hello?  We're on the air.  This means nothing to anyone out there.  Oh, I know.  But, all right.  Well, if you're going to suffer, I'll suffer.  I'll take my headphones off, too.  Thank you, Opie.  Solidarity.  Yes.  That Jimmy wants no part of.  Oh, Jimmy's got one ear poked out of me.  I always have one off and one on, though.  You do?  Oh, I never, never do I have two on.  I hate that.  It's claustrophobic.  Really?  You've got awful ears.  I have little ears.  It's claustrophobic.  Will you put them over your eyes? 
[00:13:00]  I do.  It drives me nuts.  All right, help.  I mean, there we go.  Better.  Dude, always one of my headphones is off.  Yeah.  Dude, you've got really small ears.  I know.  That's what I was saying.  All right, now I'm all guilty.  I've got to take the headphones off.  All right, yeah.  Jimmy has joined us.  Yeah.  Yeah, I have little, little baby ears.  That's why I can't wear the XM MiFi things.  You know, I think you need to grow your hair long to cover those ears.  No, no, I just need to get the special soft, spongy things that go in your ears so you can  hear.  There we go.  Oh, I'm back. 
[00:13:30]  You're back?  You can pop yours back.  All right.  That's good.  Nice and loud.  There you go.  There it is.  Nice.  Okay, well, welcome to the ONA virus that's spreading across America.  Greetings.  And we want to thank everyone that has turned on their XM satellite radios to channel 202.  Tell your friends about the ONA virus.  Oh, new footage.  Of what?  New footage of the tsunami.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone very eager to get the new footage.  Oh, there's two old people that get swept away.  Is that the one?  This one looks like it's in a hotel room.  No, no, no.  And all of a sudden. 
[00:14:00]  It's in a beach house.  A beach house.  Like a little restaurant right on by the pool.  And that water just keeps coming in, doesn't it?  There's two old people in the beginning of that video.  You can download it off of Drudge.  And it's really creepy because they pan down to it.  You see the old people holding on to each other and then they grab a rail.  And then this water just smashes the rail and you see them just go out of frame.  Bye-bye.  They're dead.  You know they're dead.  Bye-bye.  Oh, we've seen plenty of dead people.  Oh, look at that.  Twelve Americans have died in the disaster. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, they have to make that threat.  Seven in Sri Lanka and five in Thailand.  We're just ugly Americans.  I mean, I have no problem admitting it.  I was checking out the news on AOL.  That's what I do when I first wake up.  That's what I do now.  Start reading the news and the death toll is up to 55,000 because of the tsunami.  Oh, now we're up to 68.  Oh, the number keeps going up.  It's changing by the hour.  All right, let's call it 68,000. 
[00:15:00]  And so it's like 68,000 confirmed dead because of the tsunami.  Could double because of now they're talking about the disease and all that that's going  to take over there.  And then right under it, the second headline is 12 Americans.  Twelve Americans.  Dead.  Dead.  We'll show the dead from our area.  Right.  I love the local angle, even if it's dead people.  Yeah.  Oh, just despicable news.  They've been pounding this.  They just keep showing it over and over.  And, oh, bloated bodies. 
[00:15:30]  They can't stop panning the bloated bodies laying in the mass graves.  Enough already.  Well, CNN had a whole montage, basically, of dead people and dead babies, especially.  And then the anchor comes on right after the footage, and he's like, we're getting a lot  of email from people that are very disturbed and wish we wouldn't show this footage.  But I got to tell you, people, this is what is happening.  Yeah.  This is what is happening.  Who would email and object?  What kind of a dork doesn't want to see that?  It's like, stop denying it.  That's what I want to see. 
[00:16:00]  Just don't watch it if you don't want to watch it.  Exactly.  Yeah, I turned away a few times because it is getting, it's disgusting.  But, like we said yesterday, I'm all for everything on TV, and, you know, people have a problem  with that, but nothing is going to be done about it like they did with the Janet Jackson  boob.  Right.  And that just amazes me.  There was more outrage over Janet Jackson's boob that was on TV for less than a half a second  than a montage of dead people and dead babies and stuff.  Dead babies on television. 
[00:16:30]  And watching people being swept away knowing they're going to their deaths.  Right.  That's not as offensive for some reason as a female's breast.  Right.  The FCC gets, you know, up in arms over a stupid boob.  But this is okay.  This is okay for the children.  If you're going to go with that angle.  Yeah.  It's okay to have your children unsupervised in front of CNN while you're cooking, you know,  dinner or what have you.  Yeah.  And they're watching this stuff, and they're not going to be affected by that. 
[00:17:00]  But they're going to be affected by a boob.  Yeah.  Your child will be more disturbed from a boob, and it will affect him and screw up your raising  of your child by seeing a boob more so than looking at the television and just seeing thousands  of bloated dead people and dead babies.  Right.  I don't get it.  But that seems to be where we live right now.  All right.  And this is amazing.  This is why you've got to say every once in a while that the other side has a point.  You know how you always complain that white people are the ones that we talk about in  the news? 
[00:17:30]  Like, you know, there's 68,000 dead people, and the poster child is the blonde Swedish  boy.  The little blonde Swedish boy.  The little blonde, the little white child.  Look, I've got to agree.  I mean...  Yeah, the little Aryan child.  68,000 brown people dead, and they show the one blonde kid that got swept away and all of it.  A full page picture of him.  Yeah, a little miracle tot.  Yeah.  He's a miracle tot.  You're absolutely right.  Kid's a cute kid.  Very kissable.  Yeah.  Like, you know, little fat cheeks, little cut-up.  How did he live? 
[00:18:00]  He's a miracle tot.  He's all...  And then a baby lived floating on a door or something.  Yeah.  And did you see the footage of the helicopter landing on one of the resort beaches, and  there was a line of white people getting onto the helicopter?  Brown people, stay away.  Please, only white people.  This helicopter's for white people only.  Brown people, stay there.  You're a...  Yeah, your helicopter's coming shortly.  Sure it is. 
[00:18:30]  And it's a bigger one than this.  And there's food on it.  And your family members are there.  You will all be kept together when you get to the family camp.  Please get on the box, cause you will be kept together when you get to the family camp.  Yeah, well...  And it was all fat tours with their, like, you know, camera bags and stuff.  I saw some guy walking down the street with his rolling luggage.  Yeah.  With a big smile on his face.  Like, oh, well, my hotel's destroyed, but I'll get back to L.A. 
[00:19:00]  Yep, yep, yep.  They don't care.  68,000 people just gone, at least.  They were talking that a chain of islands off the coast of one of these places moved 90 feet.  You're talking a chain of islands.  That's huge.  The amount of energy that it took to make that wave, I was reading, said the equivalent of one million atomic bombs.  That's the type of energy that's needed to make a wave this big. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, and shoved it in my face this morning, because I go right for conspiracy theory.  I'm like, hey, man, Osama bin Laden, why doesn't he just get a nuke and detonate it off the East Coast?  Right.  We would have a tsunami and wipe out the East Coast, and that would do a lot of damage, right?  And it's like, dick, do you realize that it's the equivalent of one million atomic bombs?  Like one million.  They've done undersea testing of A-bombs, and it doesn't make a tsunami. 
[00:20:00]  That's what they do a lot of their testing, actually.  They'll do it in the desert, underground, or they'll do it in the ocean somewhere.  And, you know, they can withstand a hit from the nuke to the ocean.  That kind of power can only be made by the Earth, which is just a big living thing.  I don't care what people say.  That's why it cracks me up when you get these activists that say,  you know, we're destroying the planet, and we've got to stop foresting and doing things.  Believe me, we do nothing to this planet. 
[00:20:30]  This planet has one over on the people and could just end us in a second if it's so wanted to.  Anything we do to this planet can be fixed and made like we weren't even here in a wink of the planet's eye,  which is a huge amount of time for us, but don't worry about saving the planet.  It's going to take care of itself.  The planet will be just fine.  It will take care of itself.  This, on a planetary scale, is really nothing.  Nothing.  This is nothing. 
[00:21:00]  Two plates shifted.  It's nothing.  Anthony was saying you look at a world map and it's just a little, little tiny dot.  It's nothing.  If this planet really decided to cough, to have someone grab its nuts and cough,  we'd be running around like those ants when you kick their hole over,  like crazy little organisms that are making this planet itch.  That's all we are.  Stop it.  And when things like this happen, everyone freaks out. 
[00:21:30]  It's huge news and everything, but on a planetary scale, stop it.  This isn't nothing.  This isn't one little hair that's falling out of the Earth's head.  And, you know, things like this happen over history.  And if we listen to the news, we're in danger here on the East Coast, Sophie.  Yeah, they're starting with that local angle.  I heard on 1010 Winds, the local New York news station on my way in today.  Tsunami, could it happen here?  Well, it has already.  We'll be right back with the... 
[00:22:00]  Oh, so now I'm sitting there.  Now I've got to wait.  We missed the tsunami.  Now I've got to see when I miss the tsunami.  And when the next one's coming.  And apparently I missed it in 1864.  And it's like, great, I wanted to go to Seinfeld and, you know, watch Seinfeld.  But now I've got to wait through the commercials.  Because I don't know if a tsunami's coming.  Could be a tsunami.  It's happened already.  It probably will happen again.  Should I pack the minivan and head for the hills?  Apparently there was some disturbance in the Atlantic back in the 1800s.  And Jersey was hit by some kind of a tsunami. 
[00:22:30]  I hit by a tsunami in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  And what happened when the...  It's a tsunami, Wendy.  What happened to the tsunami that hit in Jersey?  Apparently nothing.  Exactly.  It was Jersey.  Back in the 1800s, Jersey.  You know?  Not even the stinky Jersey we know of today.  With oil stench coming out of it.  Munaki.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Should have hit Pat.  It'll be the breakwater for Jersey now. 
[00:23:00]  Never touch him.  He could puke at the tsunami and send it back to the ocean with his mega puke strength.  He's a superhero.  Telling a couple of jokes as it's showing up and the tsunami will stop and just turn around and go back.  You mean this, Pat?  There's the last tsunami we saw on the East Coast.  The tidal wave of vomit coming out of that fat fuck.  I don't care.  A little vomit.  Sean Candy. 
[00:23:30]  The other bullet point as far as the tsunami this morning.  Yes.  The rest of the world is calling us stingy because we've only given them $15 million worth of AIDS.  Stingy.  What is the rest of the world?  Our grandparents?  Yeah.  Using words like stingy.  Don't be stingy.  We're $35 million now, by the way.  Oh, $35 million.  Yeah, because we had to kick it up because we're stingy.  And they called us pinch pennies.  Yeah.  What are you, drawn tight those purse strings?  Damn spendthrifts. 
[00:24:00]  The USA is skinflint.  Skinflint.  Skinflint.  You're being penny wise, yet dollar foolish.  You Americans.  Yeah, and here's an area, by the way, that is just known for Muslims and terrorism.  A lot of people don't realize that, but that area of the world is just running rampant with Muslim terrorists.  And any time we try to interfere over there, whether it's using our technology to help, using our resources and money to help these people, we've been told, butt out, mind your own beeswax, stop your imperialism, and been turned away at every turn. 
[00:24:30]  Of course, they don't want us to have a foothold over there.  And now, we're being stingy because we're not giving enough millions.  How much could we really do over there with money as far as, you know?  I think you've got to kind of see what the problem is and assess it before you just start sending boatloads of cash over there. 
[00:25:00]  That could end up, you know what happened in Somalia when we sent stuff over there?  It went to bad people.  Indeed.  Yeah, that started shooting at us.  So, you know, you've kind of got to assess the situation.  Unfortunately, there's not much you can do for a bloated body with money.  You count the dead, see what's needed, see where it's needed, and then work accordingly.  I think it's the knee-jerk reactions to just pump a bunch of cash over there, but we're stingy.  That's what we are.  Let's see how much Bin Laden gives. 
[00:25:30]  I mean, obviously, no one thinks he's a humanitarian, but let's just see how much he gives to some Muslims in need.  Yeah, nothing.  Good point.  Good point, Jimmy.  Let's go to Mudflap, the trucker.  Mudflap.  Yes.  Hey, buddy.  Hello, Mudflap.  I believe you're a faithful listener of this program.  I recognize the name on the phone here.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah, you guys rock.  Cool, man.  So, what's up, Mudflap?  Well, I was living in Hawaii on Maui.  It was like 1993 or 94, and there was an earthquake in Japan, and it sent a tidal wave or tsunami 
[00:26:00]  or whatever all the way to Maui.  It was going like 500 miles an hour.  And, man, they shut down schools and told everybody to get up country.  And in Malaya Harbor, there's a bunch of condos there.  The people didn't want to leave.  They wanted to watch the waves come in.  Brilliant.  They were trying to get rid of them.  And then when it came in, the water rose on the beach line. 
[00:26:30]  It was like two or three inches.  That's all that happened.  Oh, that was it?  Okay.  Yeah, that was it.  So, when they give a warning, you know, that warning there, like if I heard of another warning,  I would say, well, what good is one or two inches going to do?  Fuck them.  These places, these resorts and stuff that were affected, I guess, didn't have any kind of warning system, you know?  And there's the technologies there.  They have the technology.  And they know if they have these seismic readings of a huge earthquake off the coast like that, 
[00:27:00]  you know there's going to be a tsunami, you know?  You know it's coming.  But these people live like frigging cavemen, and there's no early warning system.  And that's what you get.  60,000, 100,000 it's going to wind up being, I bet you.  And it didn't look that, like when you watch some footage of it, it looks like the water's not going that fast.  Like you look at it, like that doesn't look that bad.  And then they show like another angle, and you're like, oh, boy, that's moving fast. 
[00:27:30]  The first wave hits, and then it looks like, you know, you're used to seeing waves on the beach.  The wave hits, it comes up the beach and goes back down.  This one, the wave hits, and you go, all right, it doesn't look that bad.  But then it just doesn't stop.  It kept coming in one direction.  It just kept sweeping up into the little towns right down the streets.  And then it comes back.  But where's the footage of the 30-foot wave?  It doesn't look that bad.  I saw one from a boat.  They showed a boat, and it looked like an ordinary little wave that passes under the boat. 
[00:28:00]  So it's bigger than any of the waves around it, but it's by no means, you know, a Poseidon Adventure-style tidal wave.  But once it gets closer to the shore, and it's got less water to be in, and more land underneath it, then it gets bigger.  And it's not so much a big 30-foot wave that hits the beach.  It's a tidal surge.  You know, the water comes up.  It's like as if the tide came in and just never stopped, you know, coming in.  How did the boat get the footage?  Somebody on a boat with a video.  It went under them? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, it went under them, and the boat just went over.  It didn't look that bad.  It wasn't a big wave at that point because it's pretty far out to sea, you know.  And once it hits shore, you know, you've seen it a thousand times if you watch the news, you know.  It kind of, it's almost as if it's bouncing off the ocean floor.  And when it comes into the shore, all that energy that had 100, 200 feet of water, even, you know, hundreds of feet of water to disperse the energy.  Once it comes closer to shore, and now you have 10 feet, 5 feet, the same amount of energy in a 5-foot spot, now you're in trouble. 
[00:29:00]  It probably wasn't even the tsunami.  It was probably just some little wavy film that he's trying to sell it.  Yeah, hey, look, it's the tsunami.  Yeah.  It's off the coast of, like, Seaside Heights somewhere.  Some creep.  Some creep just trying to make some extra cash.  Pat did a cannonball, and he taped it.  That's hilarious.  It's a tsunami, and you see, like, a little rubber duck float by it.  Right.  Taz, what's up?  Hey, hey.  Hey.  What do you got, buddy?  Go. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I'm a new listener.  Subscribed on the free week.  Nice.  Y'all talking about the tsunami in New Jersey?  Yeah, it might clean that damn place up.  Are you saying Jersey is a disgusting place that needs to be swept over?  Well, hell yeah.  I've been there.  Punch it out, gentlemen.  When y'all have a fine day, let's go.  First car crash of the day, Anthony.  Wow, that was a big rig. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  That last caller, that trucker, thinks Jersey stinks, by the way.  Yeah, I'm from Jersey, and I'm a trucker, too.  I got no problem with Jersey.  All right.  So what do you got today?  Hey, what's up there, Sizzle Chest?  Hi, thank you, Angel.  Thanks for calling the program.  Tsunami Chest, Jimmy Norton.  Tsunami Chest.  Hey, I just want to say something about the news.  You know, if these media companies ever come under any kind of fire about showing all this death and carnage, 
[00:30:30]  and, you know, their reaction is going to be, you know, parent your kids.  You know, change the channel.  Absolutely.  That's the only thing you guys have been saying for years.  You know, you don't like it.  Raise your kids right and monitor what they want.  Yeah, for some reason, the death and destruction is fine.  And let's not be fooled here for a second.  Like we were saying, I agree, everything should be on TV.  You should be able to have access to it if you want it.  If you don't, don't go preaching that it should be taken off.  Just don't watch it.  But let's not be fooled.  These news channels, it's entertainment. 
[00:31:00]  It's an entertainment program based on ratings.  And these dead bodies that are being shown, they could write it off like we're reporting what's happening in the news.  It's an entertainment factor.  They know that people that are tuning in that want to see this stuff want to see it.  And they want to see every angle.  And they want to see a lot of it.  And they want to see the bodies lined up.  So the more they play it, the better the ratings will be.  And the more ad time they'll be able to sell.  And it comes down to dollars because it's an entertainment show. 
[00:31:30]  It's like anything else.  So the holier-than-now attitude that they have to show this because this is what's happening.  And we report the news.  We're journalists.  Bullshit.  It's entertainment.  You're using the bodies.  You wouldn't have the bubble-headed bleach blondes getting you the news if it was real news.  Right.  No, they want a hot piece of ass for you to look at as you're looking at dead bodies.  In between the dead bodies, hot piece of ass.  And, like, we use Lady Di's bloated, drunken body to entertain our listeners. 
[00:32:00]  Make no, you know.  At least we admit it.  At least we admit it.  We're exploiting people for entertainment value.  Of course.  We're not saying that that's hard-hitting news.  No.  And Lady Di yesterday claiming that we're her friends.  We're not her friends.  I think we're kind of her friends.  No, not at all.  Then go hang out with her, Jim.  I can't.  I'm working.  Matt from North Carolina.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I used to see you guys all the time in New York.  I said this new thing where you guys are all over the news. 
[00:32:30]  It's awesome.  And, like, Jimmy, man, I thought you were not that small, but yesterday with that insurgency  comment about where was that insurgency during Saddam, fucking genius, bro.  What was it?  Oh, about the rebellion when Saddam was there?  Bro, I was there, man.  Well, your little genius just let out a stink bomb.  No, I didn't.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  That's the worst one we've ever smelled.  It's not that bad.  We're trying to do hard-hitting news here, and you're freaking letting out egg bombs.  Oh, stinky egg bombs. 
[00:33:00]  I'm sorry.  I just got upset about the tsunami.  Yeah.  That happens sometimes.  How many rotted, bloating corpses are in your sphincter?  He just had an earthquake in his underpants.  Oh, it's a little seismic shift in the old corner.  Oh, my God.  And we're trying to do a serious segment on the program here.  On the what?  On the program.  On the program.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, you got it.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Welcome back. 
[00:33:30]  I miss you guys.  Oh, thank you.  My name's Fred.  I'm a man just like you.  Oh, very good.  That's one that's rarely quoted from Caddyshack.  Sure are.  Go ahead, Fred.  Hey, this town in Thailand, they keep reporting all this damage.  Is that pronounced fuck it?  I know.  I keep seeing them pronounce it like 10, 15 different ways.  Yeah, because they got to be careful, but it looks like it.  I think it's fuck it.  They say Phuket on the news, but it's spelled P-H-U-K-E-T.  And if you ask me, that's fuck it. 
[00:34:00]  That's fuck it.  And that's what they're saying right now.  Fuck it.  And they're getting out of there.  Where are you?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  Welcome back, guys.  Miss you.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Marion has to go to work.  She wants to say hi real fast.  Marion, what's up?  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jim.  Hello, Marion.  Hello, Marion.  Hey, speaking of tsunamis, I heard you were talking to one yesterday.  Sorry, that's the wrong one.  I heard you were talking to a tsunami yesterday.  Everybody.  That's what I wanted.  I love that song. 
[00:34:30]  What?  I heard you were talking to the tsunami yesterday.  What a fucking idiot she is.  Wow.  Oh, finally.  We've been waiting for this for three years.  All right.  And Marion would turn on her partner, Lady Di.  I was with her Christmas Day.  With her.  With my husband. 
[00:35:00]  How do you spell with?  No, we took her out to eat.  Yeah.  We had a good time.  I finally met her roommate.  He's such a nice guy.  He's a cool guy.  I mean, I'm saying, like, you know, he's staying there.  He's helping her.  Everything is trying to help her get her shit together.  She's so fucking stupid.  It's not sick.  I like to punch her in the head sometimes.  She doesn't realize this guy is helping her out.  This is like when Penny Marshall left Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  And left Cindy Williams, and she tried to go on to be Laverne and Shirley. 
[00:35:30]  You know, just Shirley.  Right.  Did she try to continue the show?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  For one season, they tried it.  One dreadful season.  Was it called Shirley's Place?  Yeah, something like that.  Oh, Shirley's Place.  Was it Archie's Place the worst?  Just awful.  My mind would slide in and just punch her in the face.  On Howie.  What?  She did call the cops on this guy.  Uh-huh.  Because he hid her wine.  I was over there, and, I mean, she had enough.  Enough is enough.  And she got mad. 
[00:36:00]  You know what it is?  And she keeps this guy up all friggin' night.  Well, all right.  He didn't sound like he was trying to get to sleep, to tell you the truth.  He sounds like he likes his wine, too.  Yeah, he does, but he's not as bad as her.  I mean, at least he got his act together a little bit.  Oh, really?  He seems like a cool guy, but basically he hid Lady Di's box of wine, and Lady Di didn't  like that, so she called the cops, and the cops had to deal with this situation instead  of all the other messes in this city.  Yeah, my wine.  Yeah, yeah.  And she calls the cops on him a lot, and you know what?  What cops?  No cops were called? 
[00:36:30]  Huh?  No cops were called?  I told her they're gonna lock her ass up for calling so much.  Well, she's gonna be dead soon, so whatever.  I mean, I couldn't believe I heard this show and everything.  I couldn't fuckin' believe it.  She did what she did.  I yelled at her because he called me the day after Christmas Day, and he said to me,  you're not gonna believe what Diane did.  She called the cops.  I said, no.  He said, I mean, if I lived closer to her, he'd be over here sleeping at my house.  You don't leave somebody out in the cold 20 degrees.  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:37:00]  All right, well, can you believe her?  I mean, she's really fucked up lately.  She can't get her act together at all.  Do you want to call her the C-word?  I'm saying fucked up person.  I'm not calling her that.  You don't want to call her the C-word?  No, because that's too harsh.  But I keep telling her, knock the crap.  Do something.  They want her to go to rehab, to get her kid back, and she won't.  She won't do nothing.  She doesn't care about her kid.  And you know something?  Her kid is my godson.  And you know what?  She's mad now.  She's mad at me, in a way, because you know what?  I got a my-fly for Christmas, and she can't listen to you guys only when she calls the show. 
[00:37:30]  Wait, Mariette, you're her godson?  The kid's godmother?  I'm the godmother.  That's a very important, that's a very sacred thing to the Sicilian people.  The kid's staying with her father, and her father's cool.  So she can't say nothing bad about her dad, and her dad didn't do anything wrong to her  when she was growing up.  She's all bullshitting, you guys.  Well, we know she's a compulsive liar also.  I mean, if I had to go to work yesterday, I got to go to work today.  But if I was home yesterday, I would have called up when she was on. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, Marianne pretty much got her shit together, so...  Well, yeah.  But hey, guys, how was your Christmas?  All right.  How were days?  Were good?  Thank you.  Hey, I got a my-fly.  I get to take you guys to work with me every day now.  You realize we're not your friend.  You guys are, like, sort of our friend.  Not really, man.  Sort of.  We exploit you, too.  Yeah, but you're more my friend than you are.  There's a lot more honesty on this new show.  We exploit you as well.  So you don't really have to ask how our Christmas was, unless it's going to turn into something 
[00:38:30]  that is going to be entertaining to the listeners.  Oh, come on.  All right.  We'll be up there, hopefully soon.  At least I will.  All right.  Okay, take care, guys.  All right, bye.  Bye.  You're leaving.  There she goes.  No, we don't...  Everybody.  Everybody.  Let's get into it.  Get stoopy.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Get retarded.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here.  Let's get retarded.  Let's get retarded in here. 
[00:39:00]  All right.  Let's take one more call, and we're going to take a break.  Julian, the trucker.  What's up, Julian?  Hey, how y'all doing today?  Pretty good.  Wow, that's new footage I haven't seen yet.  Oh, bye-bye.  My sweet lips.  Look at them being washed out to sea.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, ma'am.  When your parents pulled you aside for Christmas and everything to do all that stuff...  To do what?  You remember when your parents pulled you aside during your Christmas vacation and all that  stuff, and they were asking you if that really happened?  Oh, yeah.  At the table.  At the table, yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Well, you know, did your dad, like, pull you aside later and, you know, ask you what it  was like?  Say, you know, hey, son, you know, what was it like?  I've been trying to get your mom to do that for years.  That's kind of funny.  My father did not ask me what the log was like.  We just pretended it didn't happen.  You think your dad's a little freaky, too, Jimmy?  I hope not.  Maybe that's where you get it from.  Maybe he covers it up very well, but you get it from him, maybe.  No, you know why?  I don't think so, because the revulsion on both of their faces, it just couldn't be something  that's passed along. 
[00:40:00]  It has to be an anomaly.  Well, I just had to ask.  I'm sorry.  No, it's a legit question, but the look of abject disappointment on their mom and dad  faces, just no.  Hey, Julian.  Yes.  Julian, what are you hauling?  And tampons?  No, no, no, no.  I'm hauling a big haul of steel.  Steel?  Nice.  But you're a lady.  I figured you'd be hauling birth control pills.  Oh, no.  Or tampons.  Well.  Or them douches in a big tanker before they put them in those little plastic bags. 
[00:40:30]  Now, about four years ago, I had a big tanker of douche.  Women just line up with nozzles hanging off them.  That's disgusting.  Douche is coming in.  No, I hauled some kitty litter a couple of Christmases ago, you know.  It's like, you know.  Kitty litter.  We were running during Christmas and shit, you know.  So, it's like, we got stuck in, like, Oregon for, like, three days.  Steals a man's load.  I like Julian, man. 
[00:41:00]  You can call back any time.  Oh, thank you very much.  I'll check it out.  All right, there she goes, Julian the Trucker.  What do you guys think is worse, the wave that hit Asia or the wave of booze that hits Lady Di's liver every night?  Doug from Arizona.  Very good, Doug.  Thank you, Doug.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony, in honor of the FCC just being out of touch, thinking, like, John Jackson's boob is a big deal, but, you know, dead, bloated bodies all over the news is fine. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, the children won't be upset by that.  They just have no effing clue in Washington.  They just don't.  We're so, like, we're so, I hate to use the word uptight, but about the human body and the, you know, nude human body.  If it's dead, fine, show it.  If it's dead and bloated, then you can see the breath.  Then you can see it.  Because then it's not a sexual thing.  Repairs the thought you get any enjoyment whatsoever from seeing a human body. 
[00:42:00]  To titillate.  Yeah, to titillate.  Then we've got to freak out, and everybody's got to freak out and write letters and call and get it off because it'll hurt the children.  Yeah, sit your kid down in front of the news the past couple of days.  Look at the look on his face.  Be shocked.  And then show him the footage of Janet Jackson.  Yeah.  And compare the reaction.  Janet, not Michael, right?  He'll do the same thing if he sees Michael.  With that, we've got a little song. 
[00:42:30]  Here's a little number I wrote the other day while out duck hunting with a judge.  Quack.  Fuck you very much, the FCC.  Fuck you very much for fining me.  Five thousand bucks a fuck, so I'm really out of luck.  That's more than Heidi Fleiss was judging me.  So fuck you very much, dear Mr. Bush.  For heroically sitting on your tush. 
[00:43:00]  For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who fail.  Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.  She's an uppity rich bitch, and at least she isn't male.  So fuck you all so very much.  So fuck you dickhead Mr. Cheney too.  Fuck you and fuck everything you do.  Your pacemaker must be a fake, you haven't got a heart.  As far as I'm concerned, you're just a pasty-faced old fart. 
[00:43:30]  And as for Condoleezza, she's an intellectual tart.  So fuck you all so very much.  So fuck you very much, the EPA.  For giving all Alaska's oil away.  It really is a bummer, when I can't fill my hummer.  The ozone's a no-go zone, now that Arnold's here to say.  The nuclear winter games are going to take place in LA. 
[00:44:00]  So fuck you all so very much.  So what the planet fails.  Let's save the great white males.  And fuck you all so very much.  Quack.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches, that's it.  That's the closest reference he can get to something cool, hip and groovy.  Cool, hip and groovy.  Ha ha ha.  Dickhead!  Where do you go when your wife changes the lines?  The Obi-Nan Anthony Show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you, you help me, we all laugh. 
[00:44:30]  Don't worry, we're not listening, because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetie.  As you walk past them, they'll take your jewelry, take your purse, or whatever, you know?  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Pinky North.  Shut up, bring on the booze.  This the Obi-Nan Anthony Show?  Ha ha ha.  Okay.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  It's not just for you.  It's a family affair.  Add up to four additional XM radios for only $6.99 a month per radio with

[00:49:00]  Well, she know.  I'm not a light.  I'm not a thought.  It's this day.  How is she not right?  How is she insane?  How is she now?  I'm not a light.  I'm not a she light.  I'm not a light.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Hey there.  Lots to do today.  Lots and lots of things to do today.  Some of our co-workers very pissed off at us.  We'll get to that in a second.  Oh boy.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Oh, actually, we can't do that until Eric comes back from what he's doing right now. 
[00:49:30]  Wink, wink.  Nudge, nudge.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh.  We sent Eric on a mission.  Is that where you're going?  Are we synced up on these?  All right.  All right.  That's the one there.  All right.  We'll get into the whole co-worker pissed off at us thing in a little while.  All right.  And also, a lot of people want the Bernie Gets update.  Ben?  He should be calling in today.  Oh, really?  Hopefully in the last hour.  I've got to wake him up, yeah.  And he's been emailing you?  Yeah.  He's getting tons of hits on his website. 
[00:50:00]  You know.  I bet he's very happy about that.  Yeah, he is.  I don't even remember what his website was.  Bernieformayor.com.  That's right.  Really?  One word.  Bernieformayor.com.  I got so much email from people.  They're like, you've got to tell us what his email address is.  No.  Because remember, we're like, it's just, I know.  It's an email address that you don't expect a subway vigilante to have.  Yeah, it's too, like, cutesy.  It's very cutesy.  It's like if you give your wife an AOL account.  Yeah.  You know, she'd have this type of name.  Right. 
[00:50:30]  Very cutesy.  But it should be more rugged for a guy that you gunned down four people.  It's very close to, like, Bernie Sweetums.  Let's just put it that way.  Yeah, something like that.  Right.  Just a very cute, you know, email account.  What was your suggestion, Ant?  You had a fine suggestion.  I had a couple of them.  Something about 38N Blaster at AOL.com.  Yeah, that's the one.  38Ner Blaster.  We're just obsessed with Bernie Getz.  Because he's out of his mind. 
[00:51:00]  He's now Ben's best friend.  He calls Ben and emails him every day now, right?  Yeah.  And this guy is legendary in New York.  You know what you should do is go over to his apartment because he's invited you over.  But bring Earl with you.  Oh, yeah.  Bring Black Earl over there with you and see how he reacts to a Negro being in his apartment.  He wouldn't even know when he was in his apartment if he just closed his eyes and listened to them talk.  Ask Bernie if I can come over to his apartment.  I'm so willing to go.  Jim, you'll go with me, right?  I'll go anytime.  Oh, I would check that out.  Yeah, well, just to bring a debt recorder and just kind of hang out in his apartment and just tape stuff. 
[00:51:30]  Because I remember seeing years ago a clip from his apartment.  Remember that?  They were showing him at home.  And all it was was it was like a small little room.  I don't know if he's in the same place.  But it was a small little apartment room with computer equipment.  Like old 1985 computer equipment strewn around.  You should hire him as a doorman somewhere.  If I was Trump, I'd give him an apartment and just hire him as a doorman.  Would you try to walk past him?  Hell no.  What's his history?  What's he do for cash? 
[00:52:00]  What's he do to make money?  He has his own electronics business.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's always been one of those electronics nerds.  You think he would have...  If those guys were white on the subway, you think he would have...  He said yes, he would have.  Really?  He felt threatened.  It was one of those things where they asked him for five bucks and it was four young men.  He felt threatened and pulled his gun out and started shooting.  And they didn't pull a screwdriver out on him?  No.  They say...  He said no.  That was...  They had screwdrivers on him.  But they didn't do that.  And they had one at the bar the night before.  They were mechanics.  I was discussing this with my brother before the show today. 
[00:52:30]  One shot would have taken care of the situation.  Oh, they all ran.  He knows that.  They all ran after the first shot.  So they saw the gun.  They started balding.  Yeah, they started running.  He shot most of them in the back.  He just went absolutely nuts.  And I really believe he just does not like black people at all on any level.  You know, I'd be willing to say that.  It all came together on that day.  He's probably been beaten up by them a lot.  Right.  I think that's what happens.  As a nerdy white guy living in New York, especially back then when Dinkins was in office  and young gangs of young black guys ran the city, it was kind of threatening, you know? 
[00:53:00]  Was that Dinkins?  Well, how do you put that?  Oh, yeah.  It was Dinkins.  Oh, it was Dinkins.  85?  Was Dinkins?  84?  Yeah, right?  Oh, wait.  No, no.  It was Koch.  It was Koch in there during that?  Yeah, I think that was the same administration, basically.  Yeah.  Mayor Koch is the one who led him out of the institution.  Are you kidding?  When did Dinkins get in?  Koch was definitely part of that whole thing.  I mean, the case went on for so long, it might have been Dinkins and Koch.  Got out in 94, I think.  I'm going to guess 94 he was done, because Giuliani did two terms, and I'm going to guess  he was done in 2002. 
[00:53:30]  So I'm guessing it was 90-94, Dinkins.  Wow.  Yeah.  I think that was Koch.  It was Koch when he did the shooting.  76-90, maybe?  It was like 70s and early 80s.  I didn't think it was like 85, but hey, who knows?  84.  And like I said, the same administration.  Yeah, absolutely.  It was pretty much, yeah.  Are we going to the hotline?  What's going on here?  When a cop would be shot by a drug dealer, they'd go visit the drug dealer and say, you  okay?  You all right?  That's what Dinkins would play tennis during a cop's funeral. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, that was it.  Or go to the matches.  You despicable man.  The men's room attendant.  Bob Grant was great.  These savages are on the streets and the men's room attendant is playing tennis.  You have to stop saying that.  As angry as Bob Grant, anyone around the country, Bob Grant is a very conservative old cop show host.  Curmudgeon.  Is he miserable?  He's the funniest guy on radio.  Oh, an angry old man that is hysterical to listen to.  He's informed and he's really smart and he means it. 
[00:54:30]  When they would talk about the black youths wilding in Central Park, they let the savages  out last night roaming the streets.  The Haitians falling off and drowning as they're floating over here.  The Coast Guard should drown them.  He would drown them.  The Coast Guard should drown them.  Oh, he just would not stop.  I was driving one time up Route 1 north and some gay guy called in and him and Bob were  arguing because the gay guy was talking about having been gay bashed and Bob is going, 
[00:55:00]  well, you must have done something to bother them, you know, basically saying that you  had it coming and the guy started snapping and going, Bob, I want to fist you and it  got through and Bob went, you know, this time next week, I hope you have a full blown case  of the virus.  I will never forget that as long as I live Route 1.  I remember exactly where I was when I heard it and it's probably the greatest thing I've  ever heard on the airwaves.  I remember when the black guy from Newark used to call in the black, David, what was his  name?  Oh, David from Irvington, that black sellout.  Yeah, he was such a Tom. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, he was an Uncle Tom.  You know, Bob, these rabble rousers.  Thank you very much for your phone call.  Like, you'd be all nice and considerate.  Thank you, David.  Thank you, David.  Next time you call me, take the bone out of your nose.  You said that to a caller.  I heard that one.  Take the bone out of your nose.  And he would just pound politicians.  What would he call that one guy, Lousenberg?  Frank Lousenberg in New Jersey.  And the management attendant was Dinkins. 
[00:56:00]  Well, he helped get Christy Whitman reelected or elected because, you know, he had a lot  of pull.  And the second she was elected, blew him right off.  Wouldn't come in.  Wouldn't talk to him.  You know.  He was so controversial, Grant.  Yeah, but you know what?  She used him to get into office.  Grant got fired for commenting, making a little comment on Ron Brown's death in the plane  crash.  And what was his...  Ron Brown had a plane crash.  They didn't know if he was still dead or alive.  And he was, I think, big in the Clinton administration. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And Grant said, well, they're reporting that he is dead.  But then again, I am an optimist.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Boom.  Gone.  Bye-bye.  Just as bad as sex in a church.  ABC.  Got rid of him.  Yep.  What else did he add?  Another name for somebody else, too.  There was the washroom attendant.  There was Frank Lousenberg.  And, oh, Flim Flam Florio.  Flim Flam Florio.  And Mario Cuomo, that's Fachim.  Oh, Jim Magridi.  Jim Magridi. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  Imagine what he was calling him when he came out of the closet.  That cocksucker.  Jim Magridi.  Shit dick governor.  And we met him when he came to N.E.W. that day.  Oh, it was one of the greatest days, man.  He was looking to possibly do...  There was nothing in the morning, I don't think.  And it was middays were open and you guys in the afternoon.  And he was looking to possibly do the 10 to 2 shift.  The 10 to 3, whatever it was.  He was a big fan of our show.  Oh, was he really?  Oh, yeah.  And we were gushing.  We certainly were.  I got a picture with him, too. 
[00:57:30]  And, you know, it was just the greatest.  Of course you did.  I had to.  He's a legend.  We can get him on the show, I think.  Dude, Bob Grant is phenomenal.  I'd love to have him in.  We've got to go to the phones really fast.  We've got Eric on the street somewhere.  This is great.  And we have no signal in here to watch TV.  We have gremlins in this studio, I'm telling you.  The TV works every single day except for the day we need it to work.  There's one right there we can get.  No, the channel we need is not coming in, which just doesn't make sense.  Yeah, we've got to get Channel 2 or something.  Eric, what's up?  Hi.  We're just hiding out right now.  The camera guy's setting up. 
[00:58:00]  We're waiting for them to go live on their shot.  All right.  For the New York area, what channel?  New York area would be Channel 2.  All right.  So it's going to have to be our eyes for us because we can't get Channel 2 in today.  Son of a bitch.  How come it's showing up in the office?  Where?  I could see the big screen TV, our lovely plasma television, in our office.  And I'm looking and I'm seeing Channel 7.  We need two.  You want to switch to Channel 2 maybe in the office?  Man, I want Channel 2 in the office.  It comes and finds Steve's studio as well. 
[00:58:30]  Really?  Is that Channel 2 so we can kind of see it jittering?  All right.  That might be good enough, I guess.  Oh, that's awful.  And I think it's Channel 7.  Eric, you think it's a go today?  It's definitely a go.  The camera guy is just about setting up the camera.  All right.  We don't know where the reporter is, but I think he might be in this town car behind the  CBS 2 truck and Danny and I are just sitting behind another truck waiting for them to go live.  You sure they're going live?  Channel 2?  I thought it was like Channel 7 or something.  Channel 7 is already gone, but Channel 2 happened to be here setting up. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Let's see what happens here.  All right.  It's going to be a little bit.  Because they don't even have the light on the camera yet.  He's still setting it up.  Oh, okay.  It could be a little while then.  What news do you think that's for?  7 o'clock?  Maybe they're going national.  With a national shot of Times Square because obviously the New Year's thing.  What is CBS's morning show?  What is that?  I don't know.  It's Julie Chan and Hannah Storm, I think. 
[00:59:30]  And somebody else.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Slash him.  Nick DiPaolo.  I got to quote Nick DiPaolo.  He had a great line about how many, there's so many Asians on the news.  He said they should call it the slanted eyewitness news.  Holy.  Ah, DiPaolo's despicable.  He really is a creep.  Hey, let's go to Lou in Jersey.  Lou?  Oh, hold on.  I got to do this. 
[01:00:00]  Lou?  Yo.  All right.  You got to be our eyes.  What's Channel 2 showing right now?  They just cut to a commercial about a minute ago.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, we're going to attempt a little assault on the media today.  We'll see what happens.  I think it's rough, though, because we don't know when they're going to go live.  Like Eric said, they're kind of setting up the camera still, so.  Well, Eric will know when they're live, won't he?  Because normally we would say, you're live, you're live.  Go.  Yeah, but we'll be able to see when she starts going from where we are.  All right.  Why just the TV's in the studio down? 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  Is that really something?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  Was there a head bobbing up and down that may have smashed into the television?  Yeah, maybe.  Ball, ball, ball, crunk.  Maybe the guy that lost his ass when he walked into the studio and saw what this studio's  all about.  Maybe he broke some things.  I don't know.  That's another story we'll get into in a few minutes here.  Yeah, perhaps.  Assault on the media, Anthony.  It's something we like to do to try to get the word out for the program.  It's our own way of advertising this show, and we use the news as airwaves.  Yeah, they do live shots around New York all the time. 
[01:01:00]  There's always camera crews around this stupid city, always getting in people's way.  And they set up, and now the big shot, I guess, is Times Square because they're setting  up for New Year's Eve.  And we like to get some of our people in front of the cameras with wow signs or anything else.  An Opie and Anthony shit dick sign we have here.  That's like our atomic bomb right now.  Shit dick, yeah.  Shit dick.  A where's Chester sign.  I saw that one.  Where's Chester, Opie?  Lil' Connor. 
[01:01:30]  Lil' Connor signs.  Donkey sausage.  Donkey sausage.  And we quickly discovered that Eric is the best at this.  He's got no fear.  He's got no fear.  Eric, you got anything special for today?  Pretty much, you know, duck down, run like you're going to tackle him, and jump up and  smile.  There's the sign.  You know what?  We should have thought in advance, though, and gotten him a hat and a noisemaker, and  he could have went, Happy New Year!  Yeah, make believe you're a drunken.  Make believe it's midnight.  Can I jump in here?  And you're a couple days early.  What, Eric?  If you want us to jump up and down yelling Happy New Year, we can do that. 
[01:02:00]  Is that the thing today, Ant?  It would look really stupid.  Not as stupid as making believe you're a bird, but...  Yes, Jimmy?  What did you just say?  That was a lot of stuff to put on a sign.  What are you talking about?  I don't know.  By the way, this might be...  All the stuff like Opie Anthony's shit dick, donkey sausage, he thought it was on one  sign.  On one sign.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Rich.  Rich, they're all separate signs.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know what?  This might be a national feed, because we're heading close to the morning shows now. 
[01:02:30]  Uh-huh.  Unless they do one last thing locally here before they go to the...  Well, that'd be fantastic.  They're showing the accidents now.  They're what?  They're showing accidents, all the accidents around the area.  Oh, the morning car crash?  Yeah, in Jersey now.  Is that Eric?  How can he tell?  No, I think that's Lou.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  We can still hear Eric's phone, though?  Is that what we're hearing?  Yeah.  Well, that's static.  Well, I could fade him down a little bit.  Yeah, I'm sure the people love hearing that. 
[01:03:00]  Well, you know, it's live radio, and I don't know.  We're a sloppy show.  I can't help it.  Is that channel 2 on in our office?  Yeah.  Eric, what's going on down there?  Nothing at the moment.  The guys are standing there with the camera.  No lights on.  No reporter.  Nothing yet.  All right.  This is still lugging cable.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  They got the van.  Oh, I'm seeing that.  That long antenna thing directs from the van is up.  I saw a long shot of Times Square.  They showed, like, an above-the-ground shot from one of the buildings. 
[01:03:30]  I don't understand why we get cable in here.  It's working in Steve's studio.  It's not working in this studio.  Yeah, it's a Tommy shot on there.  All right.  We're going to put you guys on hold, and we'll check in in a few minutes here.  By the way, if you're listening nationally, now I think this is going to be a live shot nationally  for their morning show because they're done locally here in New York, right?  It's now the CBS morning show.  All right.  So anyone can see this if we can – we might be able to pull this off nationally today.  That would be a good one. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  Like six years ago, I was live on the Sony screen New Year's Eve, bombing in front of  about a half a million people.  Did you bomb now?  No, it was all right.  We did, like, three minutes live, and they – I mean, we taped it, and they played it  at the Times Square.  Caroline's.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pretty cool, actually.  Yeah, it was kind of – I got a poster of it and stuff.  It was kind of cool.  Thanks.  Anthony and I, one of our greatest accomplishments since doing the radio show, they actually put  a wow billboard in the middle of Times Square with our names on it.  Yes.  I remember that one.  A huge wow billboard. 
[01:04:30]  Ah, the old days.  Right.  Well –  Billboard.  What's that?  Here's the thought.  We get a billboard.  No.  Answer something they promised us when we signed the deal with XM Satellite Radio.  Too many people would know that we were on XM and actually subscribe to the show if we  had a billboard.  That would be stupid, dude.  It's all about Bob Edwards.  Don't you just want to be on a bus on the side of a bus?  Wouldn't that be great?  Well, yeah.  We'd like some of that marketing to kick in.  They say it's going to happen in 05, so we'll have to wait and see. 
[01:05:00]  Can we get it?  Eric, nothing?  Yeah.  What's up?  Anything going on there?  Nothing yet, no.  All right.  All right.  You just sit and wait.  Channel 10 is two sometimes.  Okay.  Anthony, we were talking about Bernie Goetz.  Drew Boogie put something together.  Uh-huh.  He took his appearance on our show and he came up with this little thing.  Right.  Presenting the wit and the wisdom of New York City subway vigilante, Bernard Goetz.  Bernard Goetz. 
[01:05:30]  How you been?  Pretty good.  Pretty good.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, okay, okay, uh, that was rather confused, uh, was, uh, uh, do you consider  yourself more, uh, Democrat or Republican?  Uh, neither.  Let me, let me, let me, uh, what I'm going to say now, this is...  Just get a hold of yourself.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm a little embarrassed.  Well, I, I think, uh, uh, I think...  Hello!  And, and, and, and, and, and, and, oh, they're dangerous, too, it's, but anyway, uh, uh...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And, and I, I, I...  Have you ever asked somebody on the subway for five dollars? 
[01:06:00]  Five shots and they're still alive.  Uh, uh, uh, just, uh, because...  Let me, let me, uh, not what I'm going to say now.  This is...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Poker chip this motherfucker.  All right, Bernie?  Bernie, let's say a lovable character like Fat Albert asks you for five dollars.  Would you shoot him in the chest?  Ah!  And you'd say, hey, hey, hey, you don't look so bad.  I, I, I...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I, I, I could have said...  I don't recall, but there could have been things like that.  Should, should, if, if you're the...  If... 
[01:06:30]  Ah!  If, uh, uh, hits you on the, uh, the, the, the head with a pipe.  No, i mean...  Focus, Bernie.  I, I mean, boy, talk about, uh...  The, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, I, I...  You know, we wanted to conduct some type of interview.  Well, I, but I'm not, son of a bitch, shut up.  Okay, well, we can do funny, no, but, well, I don't really, anyway, there's things that I think that are.  You sure like to talk, Bernie, I got to tell you.  I'll talk about two separate things. 
[01:07:00]  At the same time, I got to thank you for being here.  Thank you, thank you.  Well, thank you.  Okay.  Stay tuned for more Bernard Gantz on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a bunch of jerks.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the breasts.  Squeeze the breasts.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  A hot piece of ass.  What a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly 
[01:07:30]  good result.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't nudge.  Unleash the power of XM performance in your home.

[01:11:30]  Oh, I'm watching the old couple get swept away.  That's lovely.  Look at them.  Oh, we'll make it.  Oops.  Bye.  Wow.  Have a nice trip.  Have a nice trip.  Bye.  That's some crazy video.  And there they go.  And that's that, right?  Swept away.  You said dead.  Oh, they've got to be dead.  I saved a little kid's life in a flood.  What?  I saw there was floods in our town coming down, and this little kid got swept under a car.  You lived in Columbia? 
[01:12:00]  And I grabbed him before he got swept away.  In our town?  What town?  Plainfield.  It was when I lived in Plainfield.  Oh.  It was a big flood.  It came off the hills.  A tsunami.  And I caught the little colored kid.  How did you save him from the floor?  The colored kid?  Jesus.  Yes.  I grabbed him.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I didn't really do it.  I was the next guy that did it.  I thought maybe you stopped talking.  I drool a lot.  Thank you, by the way, for my gift.  This is what Vos gives me.  This is a creep for my Christmas gift.  That's his Christmas, though?  It's actually a good gift. 
[01:12:30]  It's a six-pack of Viagra.  Isn't that nice?  It really is, actually.  That's a nice Christmas gift.  Look at you.  My Christmas, we had Christmas at my sister's, and my mother's kind of old.  She's getting kind of, I guess, like Alzheimer's or senile.  Old-timers?  Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's, whatever.  Alzheimer's?  Whatever.  So we go to...  Some people call it old-timers.  We're opening presents, so it's time to give to her.  So I open a present for her.  You know, I give her mine, and it's a crock pot, which she asked.  Yeah.  My brother, crock pot. 
[01:13:00]  My sister, crock pot.  She didn't know.  She asked everybody for a crock pot.  Oh, boy.  Because she's losing it.  I'm not lying.  There was three big crock pots sitting next to her.  All the stuff she could make.  I know, and she doesn't even cook food.  She gets it from the Red Cross, which, you know, I pay.  It's like $100 and a quarter a month, and they deliver Meals on Wheels,  which I'm trying to get it for $100 and a quarter a month.  $100 and a quarter a month?  $125.  You get two meals a day.  Rich, you're a successful guy.  Yeah, you know, but...  You're kind of making some money. 
[01:13:30]  Maybe you could toss your mom a little more than $100 and a quarter a month for food.  I give her two meals.  No, I'll pick her up some stuff.  The Red Cross is feeding your mother?  Well, I'm not going to drive two meals every day.  Yeah, they bring her to her house.  It's Meals on Wheels.  Helen Hayes delivers it.  Meal on Wheels.  Yeah, I pay for it, but it's a good deal.  You can ship it in an extra phytology.  You can have the bookmobile swing by.  What am I going to do?  Meal on Wheels.  It's a Red Cross thing.  Meal on Wheels?  Yeah, Meals on Wheels or something, whatever.  Look at that little girl.  Look how beat up she is. 
[01:14:00]  They're showing young white children that were injured.  Another white child.  It's all white kids they're showing that.  Yeah, nine of them were injured out of 68,000.  Yeah, no one really cares if the natives from that area were injured.  Look, it's all white people.  They're just showing all white people.  Well, first of all, their hairs are braided.  All right, well, Rich Voss is in the studio.  Very good.  How about you hire, like, a chef?  A chef to come to a senile lady's house? 
[01:14:30]  What's the difference if she has, like, a salad?  It's your mother.  Deal.  She's still getting good food.  The Red Cross doesn't give garbage.  I mean...  Are you sure?  No, I've never tried.  Have you eaten any of these meals?  Yeah, but it's 100 and a quarter a month.  Can you beat that?  Two meals a day, five days a week.  That's 10, 40 meals for a buck and a quarter.  What does she do for the weekend?  She has to eat her last meal on Friday slow?  Yeah.  Yeah, what about the weekend?  That's where the crock pots come in.  Ration it out, right?  She's got three crock pots for the weekend.  Oh, that's funny.  She doesn't even have a car.  You know what? 
[01:15:00]  Rich is...  I don't get along...  Like, I never got along.  And, like, it's tough because she moves so slow, and I don't have patience to hold her and  walk her to the car.  I really want to push her.  So I make Bonnie hold her now, right?  Oh, that's great for the relationship.  Well, you know, it's just when I was a kid, she ruined my life.  She made me wear saddle shoes to school, black and white.  You know what the cheerleaders had to wear?  In fourth grade, we had little haircuts with little peach fuzz, and I had to wear saddle  shoes. 
[01:15:30]  My mother once bought me a goddamn fur coat I had to wear.  A fur coat?  A fur coat, because she said Joe Namath wore a fur coat.  So, yeah.  Meanwhile, Joe Namath is banging every chick in New York, and I'm getting beat up on the  playground for the same clothing.  Yeah, trying to look like Joe Namath.  Yeah, Joe Namath.  I weighed 70 pounds.  Yeah, well, my mother came to school when we're all in lunch period.  We're all in lunch.  All the kids in fourth or fifth grade.  Fifth grade.  So, they see her walk in. 
[01:16:00]  It works out.  It's Fosse's mother.  Richard's mother.  And as she brings me out into the hallway with the principal, as all the kids are leaving  the school, she's smacking me in front of all the kids.  Oh, that's not good.  That's not good.  With the principal there.  In front of all the kids at school.  But that's a funny story in hindsight, and you're such a twisted, lonely, ugly, inside  human being.  You became a really great comic, so it all worked out.  Yeah, great comic, please.  All right.  You became a mediocre comic.  I mean, this...  Please, if it wasn't for a house of open micers, I'd be a nobody. 
[01:16:30]  You understand what I'm saying?  It made you who you are.  I mean, what if she was nice to you, and you became some business douche?  Yeah.  You'd be with a fat wife?  Come on.  You'd be awful.  Yeah, but it's just fun.  My grandma, we lived above my grandparents.  I'd be down on the block with all the black kids, and my grandmother come walking down  when the streetlights came on with her goddamn stockings rolled down to her ankles, and she'd  yell our names, because we had to come in when the streetlights came on.  Would you blame her?  You live in Plainfield.  It was nice of her to get you in.  Oh, please.  And how long ago was this?  And then we'd have block parties.  Block parties. 
[01:17:00]  We're all the black kids, right?  And I had to bring down, like, a brisket or potato pancakes to a block party.  I used to get beat up on a daily basis because of them.  So what?  You were the first white guy on Def Jam as a result.  It didn't help, huh?  You were able to relate.  The guy, how long ago was this?  It's like, you hold a grudge like Simon Wiesenthal.  Well, what am I supposed to do?  How do you let it go?  They always go, let it go, let it go.  Bullshit.  You can't let it go.  You're scarred inside.  Let it go.  Oh, what am I going to do?  We'll go to, you know, to my grandmother's grave. 
[01:17:30]  I forgive you.  You know, I don't...  Your grandmother, too?  Well, the whole fucking family.  They're all fucked up.  My father's all right.  He's not bad.  We've got to go to Jim in Tennessee because he has something about Vosk.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, Rich.  Rich, you said just a minute ago that you bombed in front of, what, 3.1 million?  I can't understand that country shit you're talking about.  Did you say just a few minutes ago that you bombed?  No, no.  It was about a half a million.  Oh, okay.  But it wasn't really a bomb.  But let's... 
[01:18:00]  Go ahead.  Do you have a sense of deja vu?  Oh, God.  Now I know why you guys lost the war.  You couldn't understand each other.  You're bombing again.  I'm not bombing.  I'm telling stories.  What do you think?  I'm on stage?  I'm telling a couple stories.  How can you bomb telling true stories?  Norton, okay.  What's that?  What's that?  They can't...  What did he say?  I didn't hear me.  Jim, what did he say?  All right, we lost.  Now he's listening to himself on the air.  I know.  All right, let's quickly check in with Hawk, better known as Eric. 
[01:18:30]  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Where are you now?  We're hiding behind a phone booth at a semi-popular national morning show.  Uh-huh.  All right.  And we're just waiting for them to...  They got a whole crowd set up out here, lights, camera, even a TV monitor, so we can kind of  see what's going on on the TV.  And we're just waiting for them to go live outside.  Uh-huh.  And then are you going to comment on the tsunami?  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear that. 
[01:19:00]  Well, a lot of people are checking in on the phones and instant feedback saying that  you should yell, the tsunami's coming.  The tsunami's coming.  Tsunami's coming.  Got that, Danny?  Tsunami's coming.  Got that, Danny?  So you think this might happen?  It looks pretty damn good.  There's nobody blocking us.  We have a clear shot.  Oh, boy.  When do you think they're going to go?  Right now, we're watching the TV, and there's just some guy on there right now.  I don't know if it's a news piece or if it's in studio.  Is this the right channel, Rod?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:19:30]  I think we got the right channel.  So, all right.  Hmm.  Just keep an eye out.  Watch.  All right.  We're just going to keep you on in the background.  Just start yelling when it's going to happen, and we'll go to you, okay?  Okay.  And if you see it going live, too, let me know.  Just see if somebody's blocking the monitor.  Yeah, no worries.  No worries.  All right.  All right.  We're going to attempt a media assault today.  Assault on the media.  What's that, Jimmy?  One of the listeners outside brought me the...  Oh, wow.  There's dolls in it. 
[01:20:00]  It's the Monster Rain Under the Porch play set.  It features Lil' Jimmy Norton and Jimmy Robinson.  And look, the two identical dolls, both with fat faces, one holding a cape.  One with a cape on.  They're holding hands.  And it says Monster Rain Under the Porch, as heard on the O.P.  and Anthony's show.  And on the back, it has a picture of a woman with a beehive hairdo.  Remember, Helen says, it's okay.  You can't get aged twice.  Helen.  Also sold separately.  Helen, Jimmy's older friend, Gene Simmons with karate kicking action. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, this is fantastic.  Thank you.  Very nice.  How many kids are you going to get in your car with those dolls?  No, no, no.  You don't understand.  Wait.  Box doubles as Under the Porch display and a great carrying case.  Undress Lil' Jimmy to see his fat little belly.  Revel in the likeness of the real thing.  No chins, exclamation point.  Use Jimmy Robinson to protect Lil' Jimmy from evil trannies that want to corrupt him  and then shit on his chest.  Look at your mouse.  Very good.  Excellent job. 
[01:21:00]  You're yelling through soundproof glass.  They can hear you on the mic.  Look at this.  It opens up.  Oh, it's Under the Porch.  Look, it's got lattice work.  I didn't even notice that.  It actually is like being under a porch.  Like lattice work.  Look at the cars behind it.  Yeah.  Oh, this is a great job.  Very good.  It's very funny.  Very good.  I love it.  All right, let's...  Oh, nice Christmas gift.  Let's go to Gene in Colorado.  Hey, Gene, what's up?  We're waiting for this assault on the media, which should take place any minute now, 
[01:21:30]  whenever they decide to go live.  The show is kind of in pause mode right now.  We're in a holding pattern right now.  Gene, what's up?  Uh, I just wanted to ask the boss if he still met his mom for not cleaning his ears well  enough.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  Uh, I read online what that is.  What, Rich?  When I was a kid, I had cysts.  A lot of cysts behind my ears.  Yeah.  And they're still in there, I think, behind...  Because I remember when I was a kid, I'd sit in class and all of a sudden they'd break  and just pus would drip down my skin.  Holy Christ.  Holy Christ.  And the smell.  Yeah, and this is probably like in the sack, in the cyst that I never had taken out. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, a doctor, I told you, Dr. Steve from Tennessee told me that.  Oh, your doctor, Dr. Steve.  He's a doctor.  He's a real doctor.  Here, my doctor, Dr. Steve.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  All right.  No respect.  I want another respect.  All right.  I want another respect.  I want another respect?  Give me another respect.  That's why I don't do impressions.  God, am I a klutz?  Another respect?  I was going to say, I want another opinion, and then do a cyst joke.  I want another respect. 
[01:22:30]  Non-improving, chinless nothing.  Maybe we should just put the mic in front of the dolls, let them talk.  A little zilch.  Take another one of my wives, please.  Take my wife to the place, please, because she's tired.  Oh, wait.  What happened?  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Apparently, they were thirsty.  Let's go to John in Orlando.  John, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hi, John.  You're doing one of those wow sticker stops for us today? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I'm in front of the Home Depot off of Colonial.  In Orlando.  That's correct.  All right.  Any people stopping by?  Not yet.  Just a bunch of contractors.  Because they seem like they're still shaking the dust out of their eyes.  That's who stops by a Home Depot.  Well, good luck.  Thank you.  Look out for the tsunamis.  Yeah, I will.  Wow.  Dude, you don't sound sticker stop going on down there.  I know.  You don't sound too awake.  Oh, he has some charisma as he's giving them out.  I'm just waiting on the phone. 
[01:23:30]  I'm going to jump out of the car and stand by where the contractors go in and hand them out.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we appreciate it.  Is there an address or something?  The listeners have taken it upon themselves to market the program for us.  I like that.  And this guy's doing a wow sticker stop at a Home Depot in Orlando.  Thank you, John.  You're welcome.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Oh, my God.  We're in such a holding pattern, but it could be a good one today.  I know.  This could be national.  I would bet they would do the shot coming back from spots here.  Coming back from commercials?  You think?  Be ready, Hawk.  Are you sure this is the right channel? 
[01:24:00]  I thought you were sure it's the right channel.  Yeah, it's definitely.  Stop firing.  How is it before?  Is Hawk on the line?  Yeah, you want.  All right.  Hold on a second.  Let's think.  It doesn't stink.  Yes, it does.  No, it doesn't.  It's trapped in your hat.  Eric.  Yeah, where we're positioned, it looks like they're going to have a live music act performing.  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah.  I think we're going to be right behind whatever they're performing.  Are you sure we have the right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I didn't see them promoing any music.  I suggest you get a little aggressive today there, Eric.  All right.  A little aggressive. 
[01:24:30]  Will do.  They got an in-studio audience as well holding up signs, so it might be a little tricky to  see it, but if we get right behind them, you should be able to see it clear as day.  Hey, Eric, can you see what's on their TV right now?  Yeah, hold on.  Let me see.  No, it's the same channel.  No, it's definitely.  Right now, the monitor is black, so I guess they're in commercial.  Light yourself on fire, then they'll look at the sign.  That would be nice.  It's a good suicide for the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, nice.  Flaming.  Do you know who the musical guest is? 
[01:25:00]  Do you know who the musical guest is?  No, I don't.  No?  Okay.  Thanks.  I don't know who's performing, but...  All right.  Do they have a camera out on the sidewalk, too?  What they have is the way the stage is set up, there's a huge Christmas wreath, and right  behind it is a window to the corner of, well, in Times Square there, where there's an audience  outside with lights as well.  So you should be able to see the audience right behind whoever the artist is.  Uh-huh.  All right.  I'm seeing a promo for something now, actually a coming-up thing. 
[01:25:30]  Uh-huh.  Eagerly awaiting Hawk's second appearance on live television.  Coming up.  No musical guests, though.  We're coming up.  Oh, this is getting better.  What?  They're setting up a live camera, an external camera outside to walk around with.  All right.  Uh-huh.  They might be going to it...  Oh, no, I think we're going local now.  It's a local shot.  We're going local now.  So they're not coming back until 7.30.  We've got a few minutes. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  We definitely have a few minutes.  They're talking to the audience right now, if you can hear it.  This is Chris Cuomo again in ABC.  Thank you so much for all of you doing this.  I just hope...  They're thanking everybody for coming out here.  Of course.  They're talking up the people.  Is that it?  Now, when we go live...  I appreciate you doing this again.  And I promise to take as little chimes as possible so you can get back and change your  family.  All right.  They're live in Times Square right now.  Eric.  Look at that.  I thought it was recorded for you guys. 
[01:26:30]  Jesus.  Yes.  It's the last New Year's Eve.  Yeah, the last New Year's Eve.  How must it be a million people in Times Square, according to Jim, two days before New Year's?  It's a good band.  How do I know?  They just want to get there early and get the good spots.  What an idiot.  It was nighttime.  They were all revelers with party hats on.  Completely drunk.  And there was a big Happy New Year on the Jumbotron.  And Norton's like, they're live in Times Square.  They're live right now.  Why is there a 1978 lit up?  Quick.  Run out there.  I am an ass.  Oh, that's hilarious.  All right, Eric. 
[01:27:00]  I just ruined it.  All right, so what did they say to you?  They're thanking everybody for coming out.  They're saying, we're not going to take much of your time so you can go home to your families.  And everyone had a good chuckle.  And they're just doing panning crowd shots right now, which I think they're just testing the cameras.  According to the monitors, there's some black people on there.  And there doesn't seem to be any black people in this audience.  So, well, I said we're already by the windows, waiting for them to turn the cameras on.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Why are there no black people there, Eric?  No idea.  Because these people are on their way to work.  It's all white people throughout this audience.  All right.  Well, they're not going to go to this.  That was Rich Floss.  That was funny.  We've got a few minutes before they go back to the show, so.  Okay.  We'll hang out.  Good luck, Hawk.  Good luck, Hawk.  All right.  Should we take another break?  Get that out of the way?  Yeah, I think we should.  Well, hopefully they won't go live when we're doing a break.  We can do a quick break.  They won't go back until 7.30. 
[01:28:00]  That guy is such a femme.  Oh, really?  That local New York news guy.  I don't want to say the station, although I think they heard it.  He's a liar.  All right.  Why don't we take a really fast break here?  All right.  We'll continue.  I've got stupid in stereo.  The OPNM and E-Show.  It's not just for you.

[01:30:30]  What if it's right under the bed where it'll be forever?  A naughty track.  There's a glider and that thing that goes back and forth like that.  I got the idea by smoking a lot of pot.  And then I slid across the minoleum floor to get some Captain Crunch.  And that's where I came up with a lazy fuck.  My aerobic system.  I meant Billy Blanks. 
[01:31:00]  I meant Billy Blanks.  Come on, man.  Let's go.  Come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  That guy looks like a crook.  He should have a crime aerobics or some shit.  Let's run from the police, everybody.  Let's run from the police.  There you go.  Run from the police.  All right.  Okay.  Let's walk.  Let's cause no attention.  Come on.  Let's walk.  Okay.  Let's run from the police.  Let's climb the fence.  Let's climb the fence.  Let's grab the purse.  Let's grab the purse.  Let's stash the dope. 
[01:31:30]  Let's stash the dope.  I want you to be sweating like you got mace in your face, bitch.  Come on.  Let's go.  Your system.  I can do it.  Speaking of animals, of course, the news, I guess, of the month or maybe even the year  now is that sheep that they cloned.  They're cloning animals.  And they're talking about maybe they can clone humans, which I think is a good idea.  Because I would like to clone myself.  Because I would like to have sex with myself. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, I know what I like.  I'm going to have a lot of fun and save a lot of time.  All them old school guys just got no cred left, man. 
[01:32:30]  None.  What are you talking about?  Ah, that new movie with Ice Cube.  Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?  It's like a wacky kid movie, road movie.  Like, what happened?  Boys in the Hood.  That was great.  The first Fridays was funny. 
[01:33:00]  Like, I thought Cube was the last one with a little bit of street cred left from the old  regime.  When he played at Woodstock 99, they made him play on a small stage around 1 o'clock in  the afternoon.  There was about 200 people out there.  The Cube?  Yeah, the Ice Cube.  He wasn't going to come out.  He waited like a half an hour.  He wasn't going to come out, but he was under contract.  And how many people did you perform in front of?  At times, about $75,000.  Not as many.  There you go.  At times.  Boss, more popular than Cube.  No, I didn't say that. 
[01:33:30]  He was scared.  That's what you were trying to say.  I know you.  I know you.  I know you.  In a roundabout way, you were going to get to the point that you were in front of a lot  more people.  Yes, you were.  Yes, you were.  We know you.  Hey, guess what?  We know you.  A couple weeks ago, we went to South Beach, and I went to that bar.  Remember when we sat?  When I sat and made out with the 60 order?  Yeah, of course.  The news, what is it called on South Beach?  News Cafe.  News Cafe.  It's a long bar with a long...  News Cafe.  I don't know.  Whatever it is.  And I brought my gallon into the little booth, and we got kicked out because you got an order. 
[01:34:00]  We were in the wrong one.  Oh, you mean you went to the hotel with the cabanas?  Yeah, the hotel with the cabanas.  Where you disappeared with the old bra to go make gallon.  I was doing that to be a...  You know, I bet you back in her day, she was a hottie, though.  Well, she was an old hippie.  Did she walk out with her stockings around her ankles?  Yes.  The streetlights were on?  I brought her a crock.  She didn't look bad for 58 years old.  She wasn't 58.  She was 56.  No, she told...  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry, Rich. 
[01:34:30]  Much better.  That's hot.  And she was a 58-year-old old hippie albino.  An albino hippie broad.  Yeah.  And she named her daughter Maranatha.  Was she a good kisser?  Maranatha.  Maranatha.  Maranatha.  Was she a good kisser?  Yeah, except she had bad breath.  So it made her feel like she was 62.  What did it smell like her breath?  Uh-huh.  What did it smell like?  Your belly button.  It was bad.  Really?  I don't know.  It was just old, stale-like, you know.  You sure she wasn't just nibbling behind your ear before you kissed? 
[01:35:00]  She got awful breath.  Sorry.  It was a Schrieger place, I guess, right?  It's a Delano, probably.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  On the corner.  I do know all those places.  With the giant chess set on the lawn.  Yeah, and then we went to...  Ben's herkied and jerkied his way all over the country.  He spilled drinks in every major establishment.  I know.  And we went to one booth, and they threw us out.  They go, well, you got to order a bottle of liquor.  So I go to Bonnie.  I go, how much is a bottle of vodka?  And they go, 250.  I go, I guess we're out, right?  Yeah, that's two months of good eating for my mom. 
[01:35:30]  He's got some bottle.  You're out.  You're a cheap app, bro.  I'm going to buy a $250 vodka, please.  Do you love this broad?  Yeah, I love it.  And you're in South Beach.  You're at a nice place.  You know, sometimes you've got to splurge.  I just bought myself Armani sunglasses.  I'm going to go buy her some vodka.  Armani spelled A-R-A-M-A-N-Y.  No, first of all, Armani, second of all, for Christmas, I hooked her up for Christmas.  What did you get her?  I bought her a diamond necklace. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, that's nice.  I should have, that was the best.  I should have said that last.  Did you go to some of your people in the city to find a diamond?  No, I didn't have time.  I went to your tribe.  I know you, you murderer.  You murderer.  What movie is that from?  Marathon Man.  Yeah.  Stabber in the street.  Sam!  I shot you.  It's a white angel!  No!  This man needs a doctor!  Cuts his throat. 
[01:36:30]  Cuts his throat and walks away.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I bought her a diamond necklace at the mall, and I coached Pock Booker and some Chanel perfume.  Very nice.  Yeah, it was last minute.  I know, I'm an idiot.  What store at the mall?  I don't want to plug them.  Kay.  Kay Jewelers.  Kay Jewelers.  Hey, the first kiss starts with Kay.  That's where you go if you have, like, in junior high, you've got a crush on a girl,  and you buy her that diamond chip on a...  No, the kiss starts with Kay, so just kill yourself.  Every kiss begins with Kay. 
[01:37:00]  That's right.  Oh.  Wow.  Kay Jewelers is all right there.  I mean, some of the jewelry they have is not, you know...  No, it's a nice diamond necklace.  Oh, we shouldn't talk about them.  Are they advertising on our show?  No, first of all...  Before we start bashing people on this show.  Oh, yeah.  Where's that ladder?  Every $300 you spend, you get a $100 coupon back.  Oh.  Oh, good.  More food for mom.  What kind of necklace?  Like, what carrot?  It was...  It's like a little gold necklace with three diamonds that go down.  Oh, okay.  How much?  Half a carrot, I think it was.  Money.  How much money? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, come on.  $600.  $600?  Yeah.  Plus $250 for a pocketbook, $100 for perfume.  That's not bad for a broad.  It's fine.  For a broad.  Yeah, it's cool.  For a broad.  For a broad.  That's nice.  I mean, for my girlfriend.  You're deeply in love with this broad.  What did this broad get you?  She's trying to be cool on the show.  What did she get you?  A coffee maker.  No.  She got me a...  A crock pot.  She got me a crock pot.  She bought me...  She got me a money clip from...  Tiffany?  Let me tell you what an oath my manager, Evan.  Oh, really? 
[01:38:00]  You don't need to tell me that.  Listen to this.  My management is just so stupid.  Bonnie...  I go, what do you want?  She goes, what do you want for Christmas?  I go, a money clip.  And she goes, I'll get you one of Tiffany's.  But she couldn't get to Tiffany's.  So I don't want her to feel bad.  Yeah.  So I call Evan, my manager.  I say, Evan, go pick up a money clip.  Surprise her that you got it for me and she'll pay you without anybody.  You know what I mean?  Like, it looks...  He calls.  I hear him on the phone Christmas Eve.  He goes, I went over there.  They were closed at 7 o'clock on Christmas Eve. 
[01:38:30]  He went to Tiffany's on Christmas Eve to get it at 7 o'clock.  Of course they're closed at 7 o'clock on Christmas Eve.  You don't know he's an idiot?  I've been to Brazil and his managers are good friends of mine.  Jason and Evan, they're brothers.  And Evan is retarded.  I'm telling you, we did a Comedy Central meeting and they walked in.  I go to Cash from Mice and Men were there.  When he walks in, it's just the whole room.  He just gets drunk on vodka for these weird Brazilian drinks. 
[01:39:00]  He's packing like a yard.  Yeah, he does have a big dick.  I've seen it in the walkthroughs.  Unbelievable how big it is.  In Brazil, you can't help it.  You're getting naked to go have sex with prostitutes.  That's what it sounds like.  And there's that big Steinberg dick.  Did you rub it and say, como?  No, I didn't.  I wish you knew, Evan.  You're going to see this idiot trying to speak Portuguese.  He's Patrice's manager, too.  They all know.  They're good managers.  They can't find something.  So we speak silverback?  Oh, man. 
[01:39:30]  Opie.  Where are you going, Opie?  Opie's just leaving the studio for a while.  That's all right.  As we're yapping away, Opie's trying to keep contact with our own Eric Hawk.  For the last two breaks, I think I've been carrying this.  I'm doing pretty well.  Is that it?  I think Rich Voss is back.  You're carrying the program?  I'm not really carrying it.  I'm just setting up Norton for good lines.  I don't think you ever left the program.  You've been here all along.  We have three lovely fans outside.  Look at this.  This is like the evolution of unemployment poster. 
[01:40:00]  They brought gifts.  For some reason, it has become acceptable now for Ben to let people in to watch us through  the glass.  And I've got to say, it's a little disturbing.  Oh, what was that?  I think I just saw somebody on the live shot.  Did we miss it?  No, it was too fast.  It was a promo.  Are you kidding?  It was a promo.  It couldn't have been.  Are you sure?  I saw something orange that might have been a wow sign.  Damn it.  Yeah, we got the poster boards.  One with the XM and the wow logo.  The other one with your guys' faces.  Damn, I missed it.  Son of a bitch.  You got them on? 
[01:40:30]  Did it happen?  I think it did.  They're doing the weather right now.  The weather lady's right in front of us, but they're tightening on the shot.  Yeah, they don't want you.  We see the weather map on the monitor right now.  Yeah, so do we.  You know what?  You've got to shove the sign right in front of us.  There it is.  There it is.  Hold it up.  They got it.  Bring it down.  They zoomed right into her, so they couldn't get the crowd shot now.  Oh, you spoiled that for them.  Good.  You ruined it.  We can hang out.  They're going to be coming back.  It was barely an assault on the media.  That was like an annoyance. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  That was a pstst.  There she is.  There she is.  Get in there.  Get in there.  Hit her in the head.  Club this cock tease.  Look at the way in the back.  Where is she?  Where is she?  Oh, there's...  By the windows.  They tightened in so much.  You can't even see her now.  See us now.  Oh, now there's three things on the...  Oh, all right.  Oh, my God.  Everyone in the audience is laughing.  Hey, guys.  Eric.  There's a bunch of guys waving and laughing.  Can't you go right up behind her?  Push people out of the way. 
[01:41:30]  She's in the studio.  We're right outside of the glass.  Oh, there's glass in between?  Throw feces at her.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We're looking.  Barrel your way through.  Barrel your way through.  Come on.  Say guy with AIDS coming through.  Tsunami coming.  Tsunami.  Guy with AIDS.  Yeah, we can't...  They tightened in so much work.  She's inside behind the glass.  We're outside behind the glass.  Squeeze up.  They tightened in so many places.  Yeah, but I see people behind her.  You can see people behind her.  There's an in-studio audience as well.  Yeah, no.  They bring their audience inside so they can control it better. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, what a rip-off.  Hey, Eric, where's that folder?  Oh, there's the Wachovia sign you guys put up.  Eric.  Oh, we just missed the other live shot.  They had the Wachovia sign.  Did you get it?  Did I get it?  I don't know.  No.  No, he didn't get it.  Eric.  Eric, where's that folder?  Which folder?  You know, from the future advertiser.  It should be on the office, right on top of the two filing cabinets near the chair.  All right, cool.  Those two filing cabinets that are sitting in our office for no apparent reason? 
[01:42:30]  Exactly.  All right, Eric.  We'll put you back on hold.  Okay.  Was he going to say something?  I don't think so.  Were you going to say something?  May?  No, no.  Just staying here waiting.  All right.  I was hoping to see a little more.  What about the other morning show?  I don't know.  They do, like, huge live shots.  They're on a massive delay now because of what we did to them.  Because of the wowing?  Because of the girl showing her boobs.  Yep.  So, all right.  I saw the sign very clearly, but it was only for a second. 
[01:43:00]  We could barely see the O&A sign.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, it's not going to be a huge success every time out.  That was salt on the media.  We just wasted an hour of show for that.  Yeah, it was just silly.  Hey, Voss, you're a disgrace to our people.  Fuck you, you capo Jew.  Capo Jew?  I don't know what that means.  What is that?  Do they think he's, like, one of the Jews that would, like, help check the IDs at the,  like, the police Jews?  Oh, and they would rough up, yeah, like, the trustees.  Oh, because I didn't buy it from the Diamond District. 
[01:43:30]  They would smack the, uh...  You didn't buy it where?  Because I didn't buy the diamond at the Diamond District, so that's why they're...  Buy it from your people.  Yeah, they're real trustworthy over there.  I'll give you a good price.  You just want to get out of there because they stink so bad.  Take a bath, you sticky Hasidics.  All right?  They smell.  They smell.  That's why they got to bang broads with sheets between them.  Do they really do that?  I don't know.  Yeah, they do.  We learned that on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  They cut a hole in the sheet, and then they have sex, yeah. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  And what is the purpose of that?  Because they stink.  Because they're not supposed to have human contact when they're having sex.  Really?  So it's like a glory hole with a sheet?  I guess so, yeah.  I heard it's not true, but if it is, it's perfect, and it's the way it should be.  I do it so I don't drool on my broad.  Here's the thing.  Clan sex.  If the Asidics want me to, I will buy an engagement ring if they come up with a good deal.  Are you looking to get engaged?  Is this an announcement?  Oh, no, not at all, but if I can get a good deal. 
[01:44:30]  I'm a Jew.  If I can get a deal on a cross, I'd buy it, okay?  Hey, Mom, I got you three crosses to go with a crock pot.  No, I'd buy a ring if I get a deal, but how do you trust those guys down at the Diamond District?  Are you really thinking about getting married?  Why not?  Why?  Is Bonnie the one?  Is she the one?  Oh, no, she just stayed at my house.  Why am I going to marry some other broad down the block?  Bonnie the one?  Yeah.  When she starts headlining, I'm going to marry her.  Wait, but she might not be around to go to the Oscar parties. 
[01:45:00]  Maybe you need to take your old friend.  You know, we were in the cellar the other night.  We're bragging.  We're just going back and forth how much money we're each making, and he's doing pretty good.  He's going, yeah, well, I just sold out this.  Then he said to me, he goes, you know, in January when I'm in Las Vegas, you know, maybe I'll give you a call.  I said, well, I'll be at the Oscars.  Oh, yeah, that pretty much trumps everything.  I go smash Vegas in his stupid face.  When you're meeting Ron Jeremy, I'm meeting Ron Howard.  You stink.  I really was hurt.  And why do you, of all the times I've had to hang out with this failure, awful person, now he has a girlfriend when he goes to the Oscar party where that would have been. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, it would have been you.  That would have been you, right?  You're the jilted broad.  We were kind of like life partners.  We weren't sexual with each other, but nobody knew that.  And in show business, they were too polite to ask.  So we would just take pictures of each other with celebrities.  First of all, if I could take you to the Oscar party, if I could take anybody, you would definitely be my first pick because I would love to take pictures with you with celebrities.  Yes.  Okay.  So let's do that.  Huh?  Oh, we can't.  You're taking Bonnie, right? 
[01:46:00]  Well, I mean, I don't even know if I'm allowed to bring a guest.  You've got to be able to bring a guest.  I'm just, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have some self-esteem.  You're writing for Chris Rock.  Say, Chris, I need two tickets.  Tell him you need three.  You need one for Jimmy.  Jimmy's like your, you know, he helps you write.  Tell him I'm your friend and Bonnie's your beard.  He's your personal assistant.  There you go.  I know.  And then when I roasted Donald, I asked Norton for a little help.  So, boy, could you get him on the phone then? 
[01:46:30]  But you know what?  How many pictures did I get with you?  Dude, you were phenomenal.  Did you give me my copies yet?  Oh, I have them on a disc.  Yeah, yeah.  In your house.  I'm sorry.  I haven't seen you.  You've been so busy and successful.  Yeah, please.  All right.  He did get me pictures.  Why don't we move on, Anthony?  We've got to get Martini Steve in here.  He found some audio that's kind of interesting.  Martini Steve.  I brought in some audio today, guys.  I brought in some show prep.  I know.  Where is that, by the way?  Steve was putting, it was on a DVD.  I T-voted it and DVDed it.  Ah, I did it all.  Look at you.  I don't know where that is. 
[01:47:00]  Did you put the thing I brought in on a...  Oh, you do have it.  Yeah, it's right there.  Where is it?  It's right here.  Oh, you got it now.  It's the governor of New Jersey's wife.  The acting governor.  Well, first, I want to play the audio of Phil talking about Dimebag.  Oh, he wasn't allowed at the funeral, either.  Right.  No, he was not allowed at the funeral.  Yeah, what the hell is going on?  I didn't know this.  Phil Anselmo.  Phil is the...  It's more TV Steve.  It's more TV Steve. 
[01:47:30]  It's more TV Steve.  I love this one.  All right, sorry.  Thank you, Drew.  Phil Anselmo is the former singer for Pantera.  And I guess after the band split up, the fans were very polarized.  You know, half of them sort of sided with Phil, half of them sided with Dimebag and Vinny  when they formed Damage Plan.  And I guess Dimebag's family thinks that Phil indirectly had something to do with him  getting shot on stage in Columbus.  There's like a conspiracy going on, a theory going on, that he actually was involved in 
[01:48:00]  maybe a hit or something?  Not so much a hit, but he...  There's a lot of bashing that goes on at the Super Joint Ritual shows and at the Damage  Plan shows between the fans.  You know, Phil's bashing.  Is he the guy that we're hearing the interview from?  Who is that?  That's Phil.  This guy right here.  That's Phil Anselmo.  That's Phil.  Now, is he the one that was quoted right before Dimebag was shot as saying Dimebag needs  to have the shit beat out of him?  He would say things like that.  He was saying stuff like he would get on stage and badmouth him and actually say that the 
[01:48:30]  guy should have violence put upon him.  Yeah, and when you're dealing with a bunch of disenfranchised, you know, angry white kids  in a crowd, you know, one of them might just take you literally, and that's not to say  that's what happened, but a lot of people seem to think, and Phil was not invited to the  funeral.  I have to jump in real quick.  I talked to Florentine, who knows Dimebag and, you know, his girlfriend, and he said  that he was talking to them, and apparently the guy, and this is what he told me, who  shot Dimebag, like, was supposedly hanging out in Anselmo's trailer when he was there 
[01:49:00]  a month earlier.  Wow.  Which I don't think implies anything like he had him killed, anything like that.  It's probably more, maybe they were just smoking pot, talking shit, like, yeah, that fucking  ass.  I don't know.  Right.  I don't think he had a guy killed, but that was just the rumor, and that does.  Did Florentine learn this in a prank call as a retarded child?  No.  He got it when he was down there, and he said that Phil, that she would call, Dimebag wanted  to get the band back together, and they would call in Anselmo, and he would never call them  back, so the girlfriend was like, fuck you, Phil, you're not coming. 
[01:49:30]  Dimebag would always try to call you and get the band back.  That's what Jim told me, that she told him.  Yeah, that was basically, Jim's right, that Dimebag and Vinny were trying to get the band  back together for a reunion tour, and Anselmo was too busy, you know, just bad-mouthing.  And, you know, maybe it's quite possible someone took him a little too seriously.  It's just like Spinal Tap on 20.  Yeah.  So now the audio you gave us.  The audio was from a video clip on the Fuse website, where he's basically going off for  four minutes, apologizing to his fans about... 
[01:50:00]  What a doodle.  Yeah, about not apologizing, but I guess giving his thoughts on Dimebag.  I think he blames the media at one point.  Yeah, he blames the heavy metal media for the breakup of Pantera.  Heavy metal media.  Yeah.  In tonight's news!  I just heard a couple of clips from this.  I didn't hear the whole thing.  And he sounds like he's insane.  He sounds like he just lost his mind.  Well, we interviewed him once, and he was on something very, very strong.  We thought it was H.  Well, he said it was methadone.  I don't know if that's true. 
[01:50:30]  They had to drag him to the table for the interview.  Remember that?  He was like a moving corpse.  It was the scariest thing I've ever seen doing radio, remember?  Pretty cool.  He looked dead.  He looked like a dead guy just walking.  Great audio, though.  It is.  Yeah, and then he was talking about death and how it's overrated and stuff.  Rockstar, man.  Or underrated.  What did he say?  Death is overrated.  Death is overrated.  Death is overrated because he died once or whatever, and they brought him back.  Yeah, he's one of those guys that did too much, and then they zapped him back on  an operating table.  All right, so, I mean, the video's kind of creepy. 
[01:51:00]  It's just a one shot of him just, like, losing his mind and just sobbing and just...  Yeah, he goes through crying.  He gets angry.  He's apologizing.  He's, you know, and he's a little close to the situation.  He kind of...  Yeah.  Look, I'm sure Dimebag was a great guy and all, you know, and if you knew him...  Everyone says he was a great guy, actually.  Yeah, they all love him.  Huge loss and everything, if you know the guy, but for the most part, a lot of people  really just don't care, you know?  And this guy, I guess, is, you know, pretty upset about the whole thing and kind of pissed 
[01:51:30]  off that he wasn't invited to the funeral, and he voices it on this video.  People want my reaction to what happened.  This is not about me.  This is about Dimebag Daryl.  Purely Daryl.  It's not about me or some motherfucking psycho  that happened to destroy the most beautiful fucking person. 
[01:52:00]  One of my best friends in the world.  It was the heavy metal goddamn media that destroyed Pantera.  This is about Daryl, my brother of 17 years, who are...  Pantera's music changed people's lives, man. 
[01:52:30]  We weren't just some band.  He was not just some guitar player.  I want to say, bless his family and all of his close friends.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  I mean, obviously, he's pretty broken up about the whole thing, but...  Again, he's pretty close to the situation. 
[01:53:00]  I think he puts a little more importance on it.  You should never spill your guts out in public.  You just can't.  Because it just comes off weird and creepy.  You know?  And all of his close friends.  And I never got a chance to say goodbye in the right way, and it kills me.  And I'm so sorry.  I wish to God I could have gone to his funeral, but I have to respect his family's wishes, and they do not want me there. 
[01:53:30]  I believe I belong there, but I understand completely.  I'm so sorry to his band members.  I'm so sorry to the whole f***ing world that loved God Mac Daryl. 
[01:54:00]  Because let me tell you something.  There was not one mother f***er like him.  This would have been his eulogy if he would have been allowed at the funeral?  I'm so sorry to his family.  Not one mother f***er like him.  And everyone else who was just senselessly killed in Columbus, Ohio.  Wow.  That's a town I love.  That's a town I've played up a hundred times, god damn it. 
[01:54:30]  I love Columbus.  I love that town.  That's where Diamond Daryl got killed.  This is very unique for me.  And that's all I know.  Just bless his family.  Bless his friends. 
[01:55:00]  I love him.  Like a brother loves a brother.  Vinnie Paul, my other brother.  I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry.  We need that clip, finally.  To the cat who was shot twice.  I would have taken a bullet for you, brother.  Mark my words. 
[01:55:30]  Because I love you.  And I love all of you.  What is this world coming to?  Oh, Jesus.  This has changed the world.  Okay.  Slow down.  Again, I realize he's very upset.  Very big deal, you know, to these guys and his family, of course.  But, you know, open up today's paper, you'll see some world-changing events. 
[01:56:00]  68,000 people that died.  Yeah.  That's world-changing.  Because of a tsunami.  You can't have this fresh emotion like this.  Put a video camera in front of you and put it up on a website.  You should not do it.  It's not a good idea.  There's nothing good that can come of that.  The guy's losing his mind to everybody.  Anybody who wants to, you know, pop that website up and see him.  You know, there's some things maybe you should just keep to yourself a little bit. 
[01:56:30]  Maybe in more time you could get the video camera and send something off to the family.  But this little public display is, ooh, it's just creepy.  Changed the world, man.  Really?  This has changed the world.  I hope you all realize that now.  This has changed the entire world. 
[01:57:00]  And this is the last you'll be seeing of me for a long time.  I hope you're happy.  Heavy metal music magazines.  Media.  I hope you're happy.  That's that.  Click. 
[01:57:30]  Was that heavy metal media run by Jews, too?  Yeah, the Jews are on the heavy metal media.  Everyone knows that.  So he's going away for a while.  So he says.  I mean, you don't know how clearly this guy is thinking.  It sounds to me like.  Yes, we do.  Well.  None clearly.  None clearly.  I like when guys, I like that.  I don't know why I like it.  Because it's very out of character.  I don't think it's contrived.  I think it's very genuine.  If it's genuine.  Of course.  I'm not saying it's contrived at all.  I like it, too, because it's very raw.  Yeah.  When it's contrived, it makes me want to just spit my gum in someone's face.  It's creepy. 
[01:58:00]  That is creepy right there.  I mean, it's so out of character for Anselmo to be.  I mean, anyone who knows Pantera, the guy's an animal.  Yeah.  You know, and he's just raw and fuck you.  And just to see him like that, it's just kind of.  I don't know.  I like it.  It's kind of interesting.  You don't see it that often.  I agree, actually.  He said some crazy stuff.  Yeah, I mean, his friend got killed.  So he's like, it doesn't change the world.  But I mean.  Changed the entire world.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a little.  That's raw emotion coming out of him.  Yeah.  And he's just really sorry.  I guess he felt like.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know enough about the situation. 
[01:58:30]  I just know it's awful.  He's pissed off at heavy metal magazines for perpetuating every negative comment he said  on stage.  Right.  And that's where that came from.  Hey, you know something?  How could he blame them?  He's up on stage saying them.  Yeah, exactly.  In hindsight, it probably looks bad and insensitive.  But when you're having a brawl with somebody, you know, especially a stupid showbiz brawl,  you're going to get on stage, say things, and piss people off.  And then if something tragic happens, there you are, left holding all that baggage. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  Now he's pissed off at himself, it seems like.  Maybe a little bit.  What's the website?  It's on Fuse TV.  I put a link up on Foundry as well.  All right.  It's linked to our websites.  All right, Steve.  Thank you very much.  It's more TV, Steve.  More TV, Steve.  There you go, Dan.  It's more TV, Steve.  Okay, and then might as well play Jimmy's audio.  You were very excited about this today.  You're not going to be as good as Anselmo.  Couldn't you have had something a little less really good before this? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  This was just something I threw in.  I figured I was all proud of myself.  I did a little show prep.  Yes, you did.  And you taped something and everything.  Oh, I burned it on a DVD.  I even marked off what it was.  All by yourself?  Yep.  Closed off the DVD.  Very nice.  You thought you had company?  I did.  First things first.  You were doing this?  The show comes first?  Without Opie and Anthony, I don't have that company.  You think I don't know that?  Was she smiling, braces sparkling over your shoulder while you were doing it?  Was she? 
[02:00:00]  Was she just laying there tired and irritated with me?  Might I say she's been fine company, though?  She's really funny.  Really?  Yeah.  I want to just really bludgeon people after 40 minutes, but her she's been great.  Did she make one of those little paper things that you work with your fingers?  I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U.  Okay.  Number six.  Open it up.  Tell your fortune.  No?  No.  Did you play Chutes and Ladders?  Yeah.  With Jimmy, it's Poop Chutes and Ladders.  Poops and Logs and Ladders. 
[02:00:30]  Who's this girl?  She's just a young lady.  Some 14-year-old girl he's betting.  Very young girl that came to see Jimmy in New York.  She came to see him?  Oh, yeah.  Is she hot?  Real hot.  How bad does she hate her father?  She wears braces.  Really?  She's got braces.  No, she doesn't.  She was walking past this window when she came in.  I swear to you, I'm going to be realistic.  She looked 14.  14?  14.  I'm going to say, I was joking saying 12, but no.  She looked 14.  I would have said 17.  Let's go with 14.  14.  That's fine.  The girl looks 14. 
[02:01:00]  She is legal, but what's scary is that Jimmy's known her for three years.  Yeah.  I think she's legal.  That's such a creep.  I think she's legal.  She's old enough to fight in Iraq.  She's old enough to hang out with me.  There you go.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric again.  Eric, anything going on?  Yeah.  They're setting up to look like they're doing live.  They're doing a sound check and a white balance check.  And there's a bunch of listeners down here with their WOW stickers now, too.  So they're all spread out all over the place.  Excellent.  So I don't know if this stuff gets on.  All right. 
[02:01:30]  Well, we'll see what happens.  Okay.  Thank you.  Eric is attempting an assault on the media today.  The first attempt wasn't that great.  All right.  We just lost him.  That's fine.  You want to try the audio now?  All right.  We'll give it a shot.  I don't know what it's going to play out to, but.  Well, what's the deal with this audio?  Acting governor.  What's his name?  Cody of New Jersey.  His wife's name is Mary Jo Cody.  I do not remember.  I just kind of tuned it in as the broadcast was starting, and I hit TiVo quick.  Took over for old governor shit dick over there, McGreevy in Jersey. 
[02:02:00]  And she's apparently manic depressive.  And just to hear this stuff about the acting governor's wife, I just giggled all the way  through it, and I probably shouldn't have.  Was he the lieutenant governor or something?  I don't know how Jersey works, but he wasn't elected to this boat.  No, no, no.  Neither was McGreevy.  When McGreevy, no, McGreevy, wait a minute.  No, he wasn't.  He took over for Christy Whitman.  For Whitman when she went to the EPA.  Right.  So this is all the shit that comes out, all the skeletons that pour out when the media 
[02:02:30]  doesn't just dig into your life before you get elected to something.  So McGreevy liked to suck an occasional cock.  And this guy apparently has an albatross around his neck and his wife.  I don't know what his political aspirations are, but he could just make the little bye-bye  sign that David Bowie makes in that stupid modern love video, because it's gone, stupid.  That's it.  If this guy tried, because she could theoretically be the first lady. 
[02:03:00]  You can go from governor to one more term in governor.  You run for president.  Sure.  It's not uncommon.  Clinton was governor.  Bush was governor.  Yeah.  So it's a huge post to be the governor of a state.  And his wife is...  And she's cuckoo.  She's...  This bitch is nuts.  She's nuts.  All right, let's...  First lady material.  Here's Mary Jo Cody, Anthony.  I felt like I was some kind of monster.  I had a scary thought about putting the baby in the microwave, and I'm done.  Holy S! 
[02:03:30]  Putting my baby in the microwave.  Holy S!  We're getting major exposure on Good Morning America!  Holy S!  Opie and Anthony XM.  Assault on the media!  Nice job, Eric!  Eric!  You got it?  Nice!  Keep going!  Keep doing it!  Holy S!  Keep doing it!  Wow!  Hold on!  Stay there!  Wow!  More important than the tsunami.  Oh, my...  Bye-bye, old people!  Oh, there they go again.  Wow, there's two less Christmas gifts.  Holy...  Those guys are going wow, too!  We just spent an hour of the show just wasting time, but Eric got the job done. 
[02:04:00]  There it is!  Hold it up!  Hold it up!  Right there!  It's perfect!  Hold the other one up!  Anthony, wow!  XM Satellite Radio!  Huge side!  Good job!  Bravo!  Get the other one up!  Yes!  There's your stupid faces!  Oh, Eric is the best!  This is how you do assault on the media!  Oh, yeah!  Hold on!  Hold on!  Okay!  Now, one of them...  You can only see one of them.  Take the other one and put it a little more center. 
[02:04:30]  There you go.  Very nice.  Excellent job.  Great.  Keep spinning the sign.  Keep spinning the sign.  Yeah, keep spinning it just to annoy them.  Major exposure on it.  Good morning, America.  Yes.  Major.  Wow!  Fantastic.  There they are again.  Yeah, it's...  Move over a little.  Move over.  There's one of them who's got to move over.  Oh, they're trying to move the camera.  Just follow the camera.  Don't let them hide.  Oh, who's this old Broadway pop?  Wow, right behind her.  What has she got?  I don't know.  What does she got?  This is ABC, by the way.  It's 50 years and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:05:00]  Hey, only one sign is in frame.  Move the other sign.  All right.  What happened, Eric?  Police are asking me to take the sign down.  Oh, stop it.  What is it, terrorism?  The ABC page?  Yeah.  Making sure.  It's not illegal.  Okay.  It's not illegal.  The cops are cool.  He said he's a big fan, but we've got to take it down.  The ABC people are really complaining to the cops.  It's not illegal.  Why do they...  How could they complain?  The lady's holding one right there.  Yeah, that's a sign, too. 
[02:05:30]  The cops are being cool.  He's like, hey, guys, I like it.  Could you just be cool and take it down?  I said, can I hold it up?  He just looked at me.  He's like, nah, please take it down.  You know what?  We've got major exposure.  Good enough.  Good job.  Don't mess with the cop, man.  Just do what he says.  If the cop's a fan and all that, don't mess with me.  Yeah, you can't.  He's just doing his job.  No, no, no.  Like I said, the cop was real cool, so I took it down.  The piss is piss from ABC.  Good.  The cop was...  Oh, dude.  Stupid ABC.  Good job, man.  That'll be up on our website.  That was major exposure.  It wasn't just a little flash, man.  It was a big part of the TV. 
[02:06:00]  That was huge.  That's so great.  Here we go on Instant Feedback.  Sam from Kentucky.  I just seen the wow signs.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Home run.  Awesome.  Excellent.  Mike from Orlando.  You're on the TV.  TV signs everywhere.  It just goes on and on, Anthony.  On and on.  Yeah.  I want to thank some listeners that are here.  Matt and I came down.  They brought their wow signs and homemade signs and everything.  And they were jumping around like idiots, too.  Good.  Do we have anything we could give them here at the office?  Yeah.  I'll hook them.  I'm going to get their information, and I'll send them a bunch of stuff. 
[02:06:30]  Well, if they want to stop by and say hi, they're more than welcome.  They want to come by and say hi?  Yeah.  I got to get to work.  Got to get to work.  All right.  Well, one of them's going to come.  One's going to go to work, and we'll send stuff to the guy.  Oh, Danny is there, too.  Come on.  Let's go.  All right.  We're coming back.  Great job, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Eric, bravo.  Great job today, man.  Oh, man.  Anything to the shoot, sir.  All right.  There he goes, Eric.  Very good.  The Hawk has struck again, Anthony.  The Hawk.  Good job.  Major freaking exposure.  Jeff from Jersey.  F-ing beautiful, guys. 
[02:07:00]  He knows how it works.  Yeah.  It just goes on and on and on.  Both signs were in frame for a while, too.  Hey, guys.  That shit dick McGreevy was elected as governor in Jersey.  DeFrancisco took over for Whitman when she left.  I remember the election party and all that stuff.  I don't know.  I'm just talking.  It must have been some election party.  Yeah.  Where was it?  The mine shaft?  Yeah.  With Parenteau.  He was there, too.  Hey.  The manhole.  Hey.  Yeah.  Parenteau, he was walking in there.  He was like, hey, I'm a friend. 
[02:07:30]  Perking and jerking his stories.  It was funny.  Ben just went, oh, shit.  Can he, like, caught himself gossiping?  He was just gossiping.  A little gossip.  How did he take the gay New Jersey governor and tie it in with Boston?  I don't know how he does it.  But he did.  It all goes back to Boston.  It all goes back to Boston for Ben.  So, it's the Kevin Bacon thing with Ben.  It all goes back to Boston.  60 degrees of Boston.  60 degrees of Boston.  There you go.  Wow.  Yeah.  I mean, the instant feedback has exploded from all over the country. 
[02:08:00]  Everyone saw it.  Boston checking in.  Pennsylvania.  Jersey Shore.  Dude, I saw your cartoon faces and the black and yellow wow sign.  Everything was in picture.  Perfect.  Good.  Perfect assault on the media today, Anthony.  Perfect.  We have our own little marketing campaign.  I hope the interns learn from Eric and realize how it's done.  Yeah.  Danny's good, too, though.  Danny was part of that.  Yeah, no, I know.  Danny did a great job, too, helping out Eric today.  Mike just got a little nervous that time.  I think, yeah.  Mike stinks. 
[02:08:30]  Mike stinks.  That's why he's back answering phone calls.  He's been demoted.  Look at him.  Look at him.  I think we should give him another shot sometime, though.  He'll be all right.  He's got to give him another chance.  Send him down with the pro.  All right.  Maybe he's got to have his hand held by Eric, and then he'll learn how to do it.  What about sending the guy with the Metallica shirt out there?  All right.  The recasting life goes on.  We can certainly send him.  Assault on the media isn't everything.  Now winning that caddy tournament.  That's important.  He really is a psycho.  Oh, wow.  In 15 seconds, he'll hear this. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Dang it.  What is this guy riding?  I don't know.  ATV through the flooded streets?  Having fun with it, I guess.  Hey, Steve, are you going to get that up on the website?  Everyone's requesting it.  Are you going to get that on the website immediately?  As soon as possible.  I just got to transfer it.  But yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Right on.  Arizona checking in, Anthony.  I mean.  And for his good job, Eric gets to go to Vegas with us, right?  No.  No.  No.  He's got to stay here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got to prove himself still. 
[02:09:30]  That's the thing.  Poor bastard.  All right.  I don't even.  I didn't even listen to the first clip.  Now we can do it later.  No, let's do it.  All right.  Whatever you say.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Nothing going on.  What's that?  Recap what we're about to hear again.  So it's the governor's wife of Jersey, Mary Jo Cody, and she's just nuts.  Talking about her doubt with depression for many years.  Yeah.  And she had some horrible thoughts.  That first one I heard.  Are you replaying that one?  I sort of heard it because then I was too busy watching the TV to see if it was happening.  And the governor is sitting by her, the governor of a state. 
[02:10:00]  Watching his political career go down the toilet.  Down the tubes.  Because this woman's insane.  Shut your wife up.  All right.  Here's the first clip again.  I felt like I was some kind of monster.  I had a scary thought about putting the baby in the microwave and I'm done.  Put the baby in the microwave.  Yeah, that'll get you elected.  That's the governor's wife.  Oh, my God.  Governor of Jersey.  Holy crap.  Check, please. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, man.  Will the Jersey governor's wife put the baby in the microwave?  Wow.  Unbelievable.  You shouldn't say everything that you think.  Yeah.  Get some of those demons in your head.  There's a way to open up and say I've beaten this affliction without saying I wanted to put  the little tot in the microwave.  Baby in the microwave.  There's nothing worse you could do to a baby.  Ooh.  Well, check that guy's name off the list.  Well, there may be other things you could...  Future presidents. 
[02:11:00]  There may be things you could do to a baby.  I don't know.  Maybe the next clip will tell.  Oh, you're kidding.  There's more?  No, I don't know.  And I had the baby down below me in the water and I thought I could drown him in a minute.  And I thought to myself, I've had it again.  I'm done.  And I decided the hospital didn't work for me.  I'm going to commit suicide.  Leave the baby alone.  The baby in the bathtub or something?  Yeah, he kind of cut what she was...  He should have left a little bit more of the clip in there because she was talking about  bathing the baby.  Bathing the baby.  And she had a thought about how she could just hold it underwater and drown it. 
[02:11:30]  That's great.  You know, I think everyone has these evil thoughts at some time.  They come in your head where you see somebody and you go, boy, if I push them, they'd fall  right in front of that subway right there.  You know, someone leaning out over the platform like an idiot.  And you look and go, I could just reach over and push them right there.  But you don't...  First of all, you don't do it.  You don't ever think you're going to do it.  And you certainly don't talk about doing it next to your governor husband.  Put the baby in the microwave and then drown the little fella. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, or you could drown him and then dry him off in the microwave.  Yeah.  Leave the baby alone.  Kill yourself.  Well, she talked about that.  And she said, drowned him.  I could drown him.  Drowned.  You stupid...  What?  That is such a white trash way to say it.  I could drown him.  Rich, they're only words.  They're only words.  Thank you, Rich Bloss.  Oh, like two spelled T-O?  Who'd do that?  That's a weird one sometimes.  Name of your next album should be no such thing as silent L's. 
[02:12:30]  We can't believe it.  All right.  Well, is that it, I guess?  I don't know.  Whatever Steve put on there.  Let's see if there's another clip here.  I just told my psychiatrist.  I called him up and I said, I just...  I'm not making it.  I can't face the day.  So she upped my antidepressants too much.  And I had seizures.  And then I went into a coma.  This woman is a prize.  What a disaster she is.  Oh, there's more. 
[02:13:00]  Is she hot?  Wow.  No, she's a mediocre...  I'd rather have Mrs. McGreevy's homosexual turning vagina in bed next to you than this kook.  Yeah, this guy's getting a good night's sleep, right?  And you know he's thinking about McGreevy going, I see your point.  You lean over, you toot on it, you talk about the game, no one gets hurt.  How the hell...  Go ahead.  I see all your fag friend wants to do is maybe put a little molding up.  He doesn't want to drown your infant.  Drown your kid.  How the hell is this guy governing the state? 
[02:13:30]  He has to sleep with one eye open.  Unbelievable.  With the little walkie-talkie hooked up in the baby's room.  She's not in there flambanging.  Really?  She's got a baby monitor on all the time.  Psychotic whore.  He's trying to make decisions, fiscal decisions.  Right, and her medication's under lock and key.  I don't know what fiscal decisions are, by the way.  Fiscal.  We went with it, though.  You got your baby monitor hooked up to a Bluetooth so you can just hear it wherever you are at all times.  Talk back to it.  Honey, no!  Oh, God. 
[02:14:00]  Don't put the baby in the microwave.  There might be some more audio of this little lady.  Let's try one more.  All right.  Adversity, no stranger here.  Just three months later, breast cancer.  An interim medication for her depression, and now a visit to her cancer doctor.  I said, I hope I die on the table.  I seriously hope that I die on the table.  And my sister started to cry.  But I just can't go on when I get like that.  I just, I can't.  I mean, breast cancer didn't faze me.  Because I was already down so low that when someone told me I had breast cancer, 
[02:14:30]  there was no more steps to go down.  Oh, man.  Can I say for the record, the only thing worse than a woman putting your child in the microwave  is if you can't titty fuck her after.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is the same guy that can't understand why they're not going to take us off the premium channel anytime soon.  Are you insane? 
[02:15:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, XM wants to promote this.  They're so proud of this.  Yeah, I've got to keep plugging Bob Edwards.  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Who cares?  Wow.  I want to congratulate Governor Peterson and his wife.  No?  Yeah.  Thanks on the instant feedback for that suggestion.  Remove baby from pouch.  Microwave on high for three seconds.  Yeah, I did say that.  I'll take a bullet here. 
[02:15:30]  Governor-ing.  Oh, yeah, Governor-ing.  We did let that slide.  Yeah, we did.  But we can't stop every time someone messes up.  Oh, yes, we can.  Please, John.  Yes.  John.  What's up, gentlemen?  Yeah, go ahead.  And I tried to say it three times.  Yeah, governing, governing, governing.  I'm like, something's not making sense here.  Gover-ing.  Well, you know, when Voss is here, it rubs off on all of us.  Bush is doing a good job presidenting.  Presidenting.  All right, all right.  Gover-ing.  Gover-ing.  That's ridiculous. 
[02:16:00]  I really couldn't figure it out in my head today.  Gover-ing.  Gover-ing.  Gover-ing.  I have a really, really, really horrible headache today, too.  All right, John.  Thank you for noticing.  Holla back, guys.  All right.  Holla.  Holla.  Great.  More people to gaze in on us through the window.  I love this.  I love this arrangement.  This is our new thing.  We're on display every day.  Listeners, if you want to come down and check out the show, I guess there's a studio audience  now.  I don't know.  There's like six or seven seats available every day.  And Ope suggested we have a sign saying something about what we're... 
[02:16:30]  Well, we feel like we're in a cage in a zoo, so we figure we'd get a plaque made.  One of those plaques so they could read a little about us.  Yeah.  Our natural habitat and where we're from.  Yeah.  What we're eating.  Not to feed us.  What our feeding schedule is.  How Jimmy throws off noxious fumes as his defense mechanism.  You know what?  If a listener wants to take it upon themselves, it's just like going to the Bronx Zoo or something  and you go to some of these displays where they have the huge glass and then they have 
[02:17:00]  the little plaque on the side to tell you what you're seeing.  You walk by and you read it.  If the listeners want to write up a little something that we could proudly display outside  the studio for other listeners that are checking us out through the glass, that'd be  great.  And yeah, like how the chinless one releases gas when he gets frightened or has a good idea.  He panics and his bowels empty into his boxes.  But don't say homo sapiens.  Other people around the office may get upset.  Yeah.  As soon as Eric gets back, we'll talk about that.  Please say shit. 
[02:17:30]  We'll do that in a little bit.  Say shit dick sapien.  Ben, I like that better.  Fits.  Ben's like, he's back.  He's back.  It was more of a tease.  Like, you know, make him believe he's not here yet.  And then eventually we'll get to him.  Relax.  Yeah.  I know what I'm doing.  Way back.  Don't get up.  No hat.  Yeah.  Way to kick a hole through the fourth wall, Ben.  Right.  But he's back.  He's been back for ten minutes.  All right.  We get it.  James.  James Gumm.  Good morning, boy.  James Gumm.  James Gumm.  How you doing, Cookie? 
[02:18:00]  Hi, James.  Yeah, it's my fault about the governor.  I'm the one who told her.  It puts the baby in the microwave.  It does whatever it's told.  Would you?  Would you?  Put the baby in the friggin' microwave.  Do you think the baby would cry when the mother was going to drown it and go,  My father's very important.  He'll pay you, Mom.  Oh, that's awesome.  Wow.  I'll pay you.  That's awful, man.  And then she gets that.  She got the kooky trifecta.  What a disaster she is. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Anthony, you know what?  We have to seg, after listening to that audio, seg into the PSA with the chick from, we have  a lot of new listeners.  We've got to play this again.  The chick from San Francisco, the PSA about dropping acid.  Dropping acid.  Right.  This is one of my favorite things.  This is actually, what was it, early 70s, I guess?  Late 60s.  Late 60s.  Early 70s.  Kate Asbury.  It was sort of trying to keep people off the drugs.  Keep them off the acid.  So they figured they'd use the scare tactic. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  And they got this girl to talk about her experience with acid.  Right.  And it's really groovy.  You hear, like, the Moog synthesizer in the background, and she tells this horrible story  about eating a hot dog.  Oh, I got tons of great acid stories.  Do you really?  Oh, window pain.  Water.  I was eating a hot dog, and it turned out to be Jim Norton.  That wasn't acid.  It couldn't be Jim Norton, though, because I'm clipped.  Oh.  Yeah?  Well, what?  Hot dogs have foreskins?  No, but there was just the shape would probably be the same, just a similar.  If you were on acid, just one long, awful mess without a shape. 
[02:19:30]  Maybe a little rumple skin on the end.  Look.  What?  Was that me?  Was that coming for me?  No.  No, relax, dude.  Here's the PSA, Anthony.  Yeah.  We'll stop it as we go along here.  Groovy.  I first dropped acid when I was 18.  I was over at these people's house one night.  This guy I went to school with was over there and asked me if I wanted to try some acid.  I had read about it in the newspapers and heard a few friends talk about it, 
[02:20:00]  so I was curious.  I was pretty jacked up on marijuana, so I decided to try it, and I dropped it.  I don't know what I was waiting for, a flash or a rush or whatever,  but I kept sitting there waiting and waiting and nothing was happening.  So I got up and then went to the dresser and put on a pair of pink capris and a green and  brown blouse.  I thought the colors were beautiful.  Hot.  So we tripped down to Market Street, and I decided to buy a hot dog. 
[02:20:30]  Plan 9 from Outer Space music.  Stupid minds.  Your stupid, stupid minds.  That music's perfect, Bella.  Yeah, the music's changing to indicate that.  It's kicking in.  It's kicking in.  This just gets better and better.  Take.  Listen to this.  Pour this thing!  I was very hungry, and I had put mustard and ketchup and relish in the usual, 
[02:21:00]  and I put the hot dog up to my mouth, and somebody started screaming.  Sounds like Jimmy with gas.  I didn't know what was happening, so I looked up at my friend Terry and said,  Did you hear that?  Didn't you hear someone scream?  He said no.  I got the hot dog up to my mouth again, and I was ready to bite, and the scream got louder. 
[02:21:30]  Groovy.  Is that Jimmy Page?  Playing his guitar with the bow?  Wait for Sergeant Friday to show up.  Sure, you're taking drugs.  I love that one.  Remember the one where it was Dragnet, where the girl took a bath or something,  or she gave the baby a bath, and it drowned in the tub because she was smoking marijuana?  That was the governor's wife.  Was it?  She a drowner?  Good callback.  I like that.  Thank you.  No one appreciates it on these goddamn message boards.  That's a great one.  Cody's wife was a fine babysitter at Tommy Lee's house. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, very good.  Oh, that silly governor's wife and her five kids in Houston, Texas.  Oh, that Governor Cody's wife loves her minivan, doesn't she?  So she's ready to bite the hot dog.  Yeah.  And it hit me.  No, it couldn't be.  And I looked down at the hot dog, and there was a face on him.  It was Rich Voss.  Eyes, nose, a mouth.  I had put the ketchup to where it looked like his hair.  Want to buy a hot dog bun? 
[02:22:30]  And he started telling me that I couldn't eat him.  And he had a wife and seven kids at home to support.  And I stood there with his hot dog and asked Terry, do you know this hot dog is talking to me?  And he says, nah, let's get out of here.  He thought I was just faking.  And I told him, look at the thing, he's got a face.  And he's screaming.  And the guy finally looked over, and he got on the same trip that I was on.  Thanks, bitch.  You guys having a good time?  She wrecked it.  Carrying on a conversation with that hot dog. 
[02:23:00]  Finally, I decided I was just hallucinating, so I put it in my mouth and bit down.  It screamed so loud that you could hear it all over town.  So I had to throw it on the ground and step on it.  Of course you did.  And I was jumping on this hot dog in the middle of Market Street.  That's our friend's junk.  I realized that I had murdered it. 
[02:23:30]  And I took off screaming down the street, scared.  I'm sorry.  That was audio of the tsunami coming in.  I wrapped it in duct tape and plastic and threw it off my fishing boat. 
[02:24:00]  You will let me know when that hot dog stops screaming.  What have it become of your hot dog?  How twisted is that?  Wow.  She ruined that guy's trip, though.  The guy's having a good time.  She's talking about the screaming hot dog, and then the guy started seeing it.  He was having a good time.  Dope.  He was able to handle his dose.  We were doing blotter acid or one of them.  Window painting.  We're up in my friend's garage where they had band practice.  We're all tripping. 
[02:24:30]  And one of our friends tripped and fell and busted his skull and blood was pouring down his face.  And we started cracking up.  He was tripping.  He just makes himself laugh.  And my friend tripped, and he started bleeding about the head.  And I saw this rabbit laughing and laughing.  We told him.  We said, man, you got to get out.  We kicked him out of the garage because he was ruining everybody's trip, man.  Oh, man. 
[02:25:00]  I owe my daughter's money for sauerkraut.  I'm dodging them.  Oh, this gopher was talking about a dryer door.  My goodness.  By the way, can I say that Tom Smith from Wilmington, Mass.  He said, Jim, you gay fucking shit dick asshole.  No one cares about your penis. 
[02:25:30]  I wasn't talking about my penis.  Oh, yeah.  I did say it was clipped.  It was my fault.  Yes.  Yes, you did.  You lamb bastard.  I stand corrected.  No, that was what he said to me.  He called me those names.  Right.  Because I was just talking about my penis as far as being a hot dog.  I got you.  Saying that there was a spongy, delicious head on the end of it.  Which you won't find on a hot dog.  You certainly won't.  You'll find it coming through a hole.  At the truck stop bathroom.  You don't find a big, fat, thick wraparound vein on a hot dog, do you, sir? 
[02:26:00]  I won't talk about my penis anymore.  Very good.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony?  All righty.  Got a little gossip, a little office gossip to get to next.  Andrew from Louisiana saying a new Quinn Martin production.  Hot dog of murder.  Murdered that hot dog.  Where are you going, Rich?  We're going to play something from the Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  Oh, are you playing our favorite?  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  I love that one.  Check this out.  We have a lot of new listeners.  Really fast.  It's a couple of guys in L.A.  Yeah, a couple of guys in California.  They're music majors and decided to kind of, you know, make Silence of the Lambs the musical.  It's a CD that you can get.  I think the info for this is up on our website somewhere, right?  Very funny.  And this is our favorite song.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose. 
[02:27:00]  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  It helps me not to think of them as human.  And so I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse. 
[02:27:30]  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  We'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying out your big fat moves.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So I'm down before I jam them off. 
[02:28:00]  I'm down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to you scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  But the last girl climbed halfway but failed. 
[02:28:30]  Rufus?  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store. 
[02:29:00]  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head,  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  This is Dennis Domenice, and I want to give a big fuck you 
[02:29:30]  to whoever the hell is programming the bits between the O and A show.  I want to say fuck you to that damn Mike Bloomfield bit  and the broken sound system.  It's worse than the hippopotamus lip drippings,  and I'm sick of it.  You guys play it three or four times during each show.  Make it stop.  I want to send a big F.U. out for my feet and my foot doctor.  F.U. feet for hurting and F.U. foot doctor for not fucking knowing.  My dog is working.  Hey, this is a big F.U. 
[02:30:00]  Fuck you to the redneck lady  that left a F.U. for the element,  on the element drivers.  Too bad your husband's driving the Fartburn  and you're driving the 84 Dodge Dakota  and he won't let you get another Mustang or nothing like that.  Fuck you, you redneck.  Worry about yourself, you smelly twat.  I want to send a big fuck you  to that driver from South Dakota  that flit me off going down I-40 for no reason.  Yeah, that's right, buddy.  I just called the cops and told them he was drunk driving. 
[02:30:30]  Ho, ho, ho.  Bitch.  I want to send a big fuck you out  to all you Green Bay Packer fans  who think that Reggie White was a fucking Packer.  He wasn't a fucking Packer.  He was a fucking Philadelphia Eagle.  He had a fucking 147 sacks in eight seasons here at Philadelphia.  He was an Eagle and he was never a fucking Packer.  This is a nephew to all the black people out there  that are complaining to operational music.  If you don't like it, just turn it off.  Shut your damn man please and come dump this. 
[02:31:00]  Would you take it like a man?  Yeah, this is Mike from Wally.  I'd like to leave a big fuck you  for that stupid whore from American Airlines  and Washington dollars.  Your name's Amber, you dumb cunt.  Stupid fucking bitch.  The flight was supposed to leave for 9.59.  You only had one night  so you posted 10.59  and I missed my flight  and got stranded in Washington, D.C.  for fucking Christmas.  Thanks a lot, you fucking whore.  I hope your grandfather had a heart attack  in the middle of fucking opening presents. 
[02:31:30]  Fuck you.  I want to give a big F.U. to O.N.A.  You can't get a virus on your cell phone  from somebody calling you.  You're fucking tools.  You only get it if you download  one of those gay ringtones  that Voss has on his phone.  Fuck you.  Listen up here, Long Island.  I want to give a big fuck you to you assholes.  It snowed one goddamn inch  and you fucking assholes keep asking me  what the fuck the roads are like.  It's an inch, you fucking losers.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to say fuck you 
[02:32:00]  to all the hippies out there  that don't support the soldiers.  And those little stickers  do support the soldiers  because we get the money  and it just lets us know  that they're not a fucking dumb hippie  who doesn't like what we do.  So fuck you guys.  We're out here with you.  I'm next to you guys  to be a little fags.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line  at 1-866-FU-LINE 1  1-866-FU-LINE 1  Well fuck you very much.  Because that's how we fix shit  with tape. 
[02:32:30]  Because if your glasses break  you put a piece of tape.  The taillight breaks  on the car  piece of tape.  One night I didn't have a condom. 
[02:33:00]  Don't go home  and try that shit either.  All right.  You know people should laugh  if that's good for you.  The problem is  you can't go out  and see a comedian  every night of the week.  You people have got to learn  to amuse yourselves.  And I'm going to give you  a couple of tips.  Like for instance  the next time you're the lead car  in a funeral procession  make a wrong turn. 
[02:33:30]  Oh what the heck  lead everybody through a car wash.  Hot wax  for the bereaved.  My favorite  you can do this anytime  but the next time  you're in the supermarket  put things  in other people's buggy  when they're not looking.  And they'll get behind them  in the checkout line.  I swear you'll see them  they'll be like this  like  I don't remember  getting that. 
[02:34:00]  Then they'll pay for it.  Or if you should ever  have to fill out  another job application  where it says  nearest relative  put 12 miles.  We've made it  even easier  for you to give XM.  Share the XM experience  with your friends  and family

[02:35:00]  to 10am  get to the parking lot  of the Home Depot  at 6130 East Colonial Drive  in Orlando, Florida  and pick up your  Wow Sticker.  Whoa!  Those aren't real.  Yes they are.  John will be handing out  Wow Stickers  from 7am  to 10am  one third of a mile  east of 436.  I'm getting an erection  as we speak.  Once again  here is how it should sound.  The Wow Sticker Stop  brought to you  by your pals  at the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Oaday Virus  XM 202  XM News  Talk  Sports  and Information 
[02:35:30]  It's everything  all the time.  XM 202  All in all  on your test  Now we're  breaking the wall  All in all  on your test  Now we're  breaking the wall  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, 
[02:36:00]  the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yes.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  We're doing our own marketing at this point.  We got a huge hit today on Good Morning America, Anthony.  That was huge, national.  This Eric kid is unbelievable.  He really is.  This Eric kid's going to go far.  He was a huge hire for the program, absolutely a huge hire.  He got the job done again today.  Good Morning America.  And he has these just massive, huge Opie and Anthony signs, 
[02:36:30]  wow signs, our cartoon faces, just massive.  It wasn't just a little thing where you're like, wait, what was that?  I mean, you couldn't help it.  It was the whole thing.  It was very distracting.  You weren't looking at anyone else's sign or anything in that shot.  No.  Not even the anchor, the person that was doing the report or anything.  You're looking at those stupid, colorful signs popping up and down.  There are a lot of good signs we have around the office.  People send in some really funny ones. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, people send in.  Oh, Ben, that's a lot.  We got a great sign some listeners sent in.  It's hilarious.  It says Opie Anthony XM, and above it, in big yellow letters, it says Shit Dick.  Yes.  Because people listen to the program, they hear us, a program, they hear us talk about things.  They heard us play that song, Shit Dick, and then they send in signs.  That was a fine song on the Panzerfaust record label, Shit Dick. 
[02:37:30]  It was a little song from Panzerfaust Records, Shit Dick.  1992.  Who wrote Shit Dick?  Now we got to play the song for all the new listeners.  Ed Norton.  Mrs. Manicotti walks in.  Oh, Judas P, Shit Dick.  Little song, Panzerfaust Records, Shit Dick.  Oh, Mr. Kramden.  Oh, we're popping it in there.  There we are.  It's a fine number. 
[02:38:00]  Of course it is.  Shit Dick.  Well, we got some gossip, but we should play the song for all the new listeners out there.  Did you get that shirt out of the way there, Hawk, so you can see Shit Dick when you're  in the studio.  Oh, we're putting the signs back where they were?  They should be up there.  Oh, that's where it was?  It was taken down.  It was taken down.  We'll explain in a second.  Why would anyone take down?  We'll explain in a second, but for the new listeners, a lot of people just getting their  XM satellite radios for Christmas, they don't know what this song's about, so we should  just play it.  You're right. 
[02:38:30]  And then the sign was made, and then it caused a stir at the office after we left the air yesterday.  So, first, the song.  We hate all Shit Dick.  Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Mike. 
[02:39:00]  Michael Jackson, Shit Dick.  Jeffrey Dahmer, Cannonball, Shit Dick.  We hate Shit Dick.  But slamming Shit Dick.  Boy, George, Shit Dick.  Freddie Mercury, Shit Dick. 
[02:39:30]  David Bowie, Shit Dick.  Rob, Albert, Judas, Priest, Shit Dick.  Shit Dick.  Shit Dick.  Rock, Cuts, and...  ...Lifaraci, Shit Dick.  ...Theme Neighbor, Shit Dick.  ...Albert, England, Freddy Krueger. 
[02:40:00]  ...Fizz, Fox, and Shit Dick.  ...Fizz, Fox, and Shit Dick.  ...Fuck, and...  ...Fizz, Fox, and...  ...Fizz.  Richard Simmons.  ...Shit Dick.  There you have it. 
[02:40:30]  The song that started it all, Anthony, right?  Yeah, this was sent in by Panzerfaust Records.  And it's an assortment of really bad, racist, and homophobic music.  And, you know, we listen to these things.  People send them in.  We listen to anything.  And they're offensive.  I'll fess up to that.  Very offensive. 
[02:41:00]  But there's something about these Panzerfaust ones that are just catchy in a dopey way.  Makes you chuckle a little bit.  And you find yourself at home going...  You'll be singing that one.  Jim Norton.  Shit dick.  I don't like that version.  Under the porch.  Shit dick.  No, no, no.  That's not the lyrics.  By actually taking straight shit dick.  People at Sirius.  Shit dick.  So, then our listeners started making signs. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  And one of them is the shit dick sign that is displayed over the window.  Uh-huh.  And some people...  Some people don't like it, Opie.  What?  Eh.  Some people got a little annoyed from what I hear.  Basically, Anthony and I, you know, when 10 o'clock comes, we just leave.  I flee the studio.  We're pretty much calling it in these days.  We've done 10 years of radio together.  We just call it in.  I mean, let's be honest with each other.  Call it in.  You know, we are here about 5.15, so we'll show prep 45 minutes a day. 
[02:42:00]  Tops.  Nah.  10 o'clock comes.  We can't be bothered.  We go right home, right?  Get me out of here.  But our fine staff stays sometimes till like 5 in the afternoon, right?  Wow.  All day, Anthony.  That's crazy.  All day to make us look good because we really don't care at this point.  They stay till my bedtime.  Right.  5 o'clock.  Fucking schedule.  Are you guys insane?  Time management.  All right.  Yeah, that's good.  All right.  So they're working their asses off yesterday.  And what happened?  I guess Eric was the first one or Ben that heard the commotion. 
[02:42:30]  Hold on.  Hold on, Ben.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  It's Ben.  Oh.  There we go.  Hurricane Ben.  Look at him.  Hurricane Derek for this song.  It's Ben Ben.  Have a hurricane.  Yeah, no.  I heard the door.  I was in the office.  I heard the door slam.  It sounded.  These doors are really heavy.  The studio doors?  Yeah, they weigh about 500 pounds each.  These are soundproof, heavy doors.  I just heard.  I couldn't believe how loud it was. 
[02:43:00]  By the way, it's impossible to slam that door.  Try it.  Someone try to slam this door.  Hope wants that door slam.  You had to be so pissed to actually slam.  It was way louder than that.  Yeah, yeah.  I heard it all the way across the hall.  It was loud.  Someone was pissed.  Someone was pissed.  And that's all you heard.  Yeah, I was on the computer.  I wasn't really.  But I then heard.  We were trying to get the latest gossip.  Yeah, of course you are.  What happened?  A door slamming in Boston.  So then Eric actually knows what happened, right? 
[02:43:30]  So later on, one of the guys here at XM was doing an interview using our studio.  Well, now why was he doing that?  I guess he got permission.  He got permission to use the Opie and Anthony studio.  It says the Opie and Anthony studio, basically.  This huge sign says Opie and Anthony.  Now, there's two studios in here.  There's the Opie and Anthony studio.  Which is really huge and palatial.  Roomie.  And quite luxurious, Anthony.  You could really stretch out.  Look, we could all just.  We could all just.  Yeah, right, Ben?  Look at us.  Everyone can stretch at the same time. 
[02:44:00]  Look.  Big through the hips.  Roomie.  Roomie.  Very roomie.  If this was a woman, it would be a size 14.  Right.  We're a big, fat studio.  We're just a large spice.  And then there's the other studio.  Then there's the other closet.  Where all the people.  That used to use this big, huge studio.  Look at the size, size, size.  Giant.  They were kind of displaced.  And they were given that little thing over there. 
[02:44:30]  They turned someone's office.  Which wasn't even really an office.  It was a desk and a phone.  It was a half office.  Yeah.  Into a studio.  Where they fit a console, monitors, TV, everything you would need for a studio in a closet.  Right.  And that is what everyone else uses.  Right.  Because I believe people knew there would be some type of conflict if some of the people  that worked here previously, to us being here, started using our studio.  Because we like it in a certain way. 
[02:45:00]  And that certain way is hanging up some of our trophies of conquests in our pictures that  we hang on the wall.  Some of the new girls that have been on the show.  Some of our videos and DVDs that we get from friends of the show.  He spilt the chips.  Oh my God.  The poker chips were falling out.  What, are you going to heave those at somebody?  No, no, no.  Yeah, then we have the famous poker chips, Anthony, that can be thrown at a guest at any  given time.  But then you look up top and there's various lubricants on the shelves.  Well, you've got the Century Sex video and the wiffle ball bat that's been used a few 
[02:45:30]  times.  And sure, all the KY and lubricants.  And lubricants.  And then the montage of girls that have been naked on the show.  And the signs.  And the signs, right.  The signs.  Well, let's go from right to left.  You've got Donkey Sausage, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Wool Connor, Opie and Anthony.  Lil.  Then you've got Where's Chester.  Where's Chester?  Opie and Anthony XM.  I mean, if you want to add to the signs, that would be wonderful.  And then this one over here that caused all the problems. 
[02:46:00]  Shit dick.  In our studio.  Now, what this sign is meant for.  This is like coming into our house when you enter that door over there.  What that sign is meant for is for assault on the media.  That's like our atomic bomb.  Yeah, that's like phase three.  Yeah.  When it gets boring.  You know, eventually it'll get boring just to see our names and wow and FM on TV.  And we want to ruin it.  And then we'll start really upping the ante.  Because if you're sitting there watching the news and all of a sudden you see shit dick pop up, man, that is such a treat.  I guarantee if you're at home watching and you see shit dick pop up, shit dick Opie and Anthony, you will laugh so hard you will have to go to the bathroom. 
[02:46:30]  It might hemorrhage.  Yeah.  It's one of those things because you see it on TV and it's shocking.  Shock, shock, shocking.  It's shocking.  So you see, and that's what the sign is for.  Right.  But, you know, people that don't know the back story might see that and think, you know, we're hateful.  But this is our playhouse.  This is our playhouse.  We have stuff in here.  Right.  And if someone wants to come in and use our studio because it's roomy and big enough to have guests in, it's not our problem if they're offended by some of the stuff that goes on in here. 
[02:47:00]  Well, who was using the studio?  The people from the Broadway channel.  The Broadway channel.  The Broadway channel.  On Broadway.  Nice.  The people, Eric, or is it? 
[02:47:30]  How many people?  The gentleman who runs the Broadway channel.  Oh, gentleman.  And he's not used to shit dick?  Well, we don't know.  We don't know, Rich.  We don't know.  I don't think he, uh.  Please, Broadway.  Please, how about Nathan Lane's shit dick?  All right, Rich.  Let's relax.  That's okay.  I can't imagine why somebody from a Broadway who runs a Broadway channel would be offended by shit dick.  I don't either.  I cannot imagine why.  I don't know.  All right, so what happened?  So they come in.  They set up.  Now, who were they interviewing? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know who the lady is, but she had to be pushing 50.  So she's well-established in Broadway.  Yeah.  I hear she's a very famous Broadway actress.  Oh.  Oh, really?  If you're in the Broadway circle, you would know who she was.  Right.  If you're not, you could care less about this.  I hate you.  No idea.  Exactly.  So they come in.  What was her name?  Mario Cantone?  Mario Cantone.  Shit dick.  I hate to say this.  Cartman.  Shit dick. 
[02:48:30]  Mario Cantone.  Shit dick.  I can't do the impression, obviously.  So anyway, they come in, and they're setting up, and the engineer that they're using makes  sure that our settings are fine.  They redo it so they can do their interview.  They do the interview.  Yeah.  About 25 minutes.  Interview goes by.  All done.  The actress gets up with her publicist and leaves.  The Broadway guy's here, and somebody who's, I think he might be the head of the New York  Theater's Guild.  Mr. Fabasham.  He's putting on the Lodge show, I believe. 
[02:49:00]  The Broadway guy is sitting where Rich is, and the New York Theater Guild guy is sitting  right here on the lesbian couch.  Oh, boy.  Only he knew.  They're talking with the person who...  As close as he'll get to vagina.  They're talking with the person who was engineering the show, and I see the Broadway guy's face  just getting all mad.  Uh-oh.  So we're in the producer's studio doing some work, so we turn it on, pot it up, so we can 
[02:49:30]  hear what's going on.  Oh!  I wish you taped it.  We tried to, but they would have known we were taping it.  We tried to.  We really did.  Wow.  He's all upset, starts complaining to the engineer, saying, you know, doesn't XM have  some kind of line of decency that this stuff isn't appropriate in the workplace?  No, they don't.  Oh, in the workplace.  In the workplace.  In the workplace.  This isn't a workplace.  We get to just screw off.  That's our jobs.  This isn't work.  This isn't an office that you go to work in. 
[02:50:00]  Stop confusing radio with a workplace.  Well, it is.  No, no.  That's the people that do confuse it only get to a certain level and wonder why nobody knows  their name or cares about them.  That's why, stupid.  Believe it or not, this is a place like an artist's studio.  It's not an office.  This is where you come in and create.  We're artists.  And make things unfettered by stupid office regulations like you want to smear all over  the place.  Anyone that says workplace, my opinion is that the type of jizz bucket that will throw that 
[02:50:30]  word around and scare the boss.  I don't like that type of harassment in the workplace.  Workplace.  Yeah, because it instantly conjures up the harassment things and people getting in trouble.  I can't wait to get rid of those cubicles.  Yeah.  It can't happen soon enough.  When is the bulldozer coming in?  We should have a party.  Just get a sledgehammer.  Because it does look like a workplace because all these boars that have been hanging out  in this office for the last few years have made it into a boring workplace. 
[02:51:00]  They try to be individuals by hanging little things up in the cubicle, but it's still a cubicle.  Placards.  So what happened there?  You need a tsunami to sweep through here and just wash it out a window.  So like I said, I see the guy getting mad, so we pot it up and we're listening and he's  talking about, doesn't XM have some kind of line of decency that everyone has to follow  in the workplace?  And while he's saying that, he leans over and that sign was on the floor at the time.  The shit dick sign.  Picks up the shit dick sign and he starts waving it in his left hand, right? 
[02:51:30]  And he's like, I mean, look at this.  Shit dick.  And he said it in a deep voice.  He made a camera and snapped a picture of him holding that sign up.  We had to put it up on the website.  He was mad because it wasn't a real dick in his hand.  Oh, Voss.  That's not false.  Shut up, those Broadway faggots.  Let me tell you something about this.  If you want to sue anyone, his name is Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  I try hitting dump buttons around here.  We have no idea if this guy.  I try hitting dump buttons.  I don't know if they work or not around here.  I don't know.  I'm not saying the guy's name, but you know, they're a bunch of liberals that get so mad 
[02:52:00]  at everything, you know?  They're just a bunch of babies.  I can't say this, say that.  The goddamn, you know what?  You know, if Janine Garoppolo was in here saying that shit, they wouldn't have a problem.  Why, am I in trouble or something?  No, go.  No, I just, I just, you know, forget it.  Just liberals.  Dude, I don't, look, I personally, I can't see why anyone who runs a Broadway channel would  be offended by the term shit dick.  I don't know why that would bother them or affect them at all.  It has nothing to do with them.  What?  No.  What?  What?  Shut up, you coward. 
[02:52:30]  Jesus, will you be a man for one?  Stop going.  He's looking around.  Is he here?  Shut up.  He gets all scared like the guy might be here.  No, I thought it was like an attempt.  What's he going to do, running and sing at you?  Shut your mouth.  I didn't appreciate that.  Get back into your, get back in the closet studio.  That is a closet studio, as it should be.  Voss, Voss, stupid Voss.  Fuck off, Voss.  He's going to come in and sing and dance at his face.  The Jets versus the shit dicks. 
[02:53:00]  Yuck.  Yuck.  Oh, my God.  How about that?  You know what?  I don't want to offend anybody's sense of decency.  So, you know what may have to happen?  Yeah.  No longer permitted in the studio.  We don't want to upset anybody.  Yes, that might have to be.  Well, he entered our, you know, our atmosphere here, so.  Of course.  Nobody's waving it around.  That sign is up in the top corner.  You don't have to look at it.  Right.  Get a hold of yourself.  But this is part of the workplace. 
[02:53:30]  Ah, the workplace.  So we need to, you know, get rid of anything.  And I heard that there was some offense taken at the nude woman pictures.  Oh, my God.  So the guy's holding the sign and waving it to the engineer, and he goes, I mean, come on,  shit, dick, what is this?  And then he throws the sign down, right?  The theater guild guy sitting right here, and he goes, this, he's like, we walked in  here, and I didn't notice until about a couple minutes we're doing the interview that all  this indecency is in here.  I mean, if I would have known, and he points to the hot naked pictures. 
[02:54:00]  The wonderful wall of hot girls.  Beautiful girls.  Girls.  Right.  And the last one is one of the girls that were in the studio here, young, nude, on all  fours, on a bed.  Yeah, that's the girl that took.  Giving a sexy little look.  That's the girl that took three fingers, Anthony.  Right.  Yep.  And there is nothing offensive about that photo.  Nope, she's just top of this.  It is a beautiful photo.  Beautiful.  She's not in the Opie and Anthony studio.  Yeah.  Three fingers.  I got her beat my two.  It's very surprising that somebody else from Broadway would be offended by the naked girls. 
[02:54:30]  And it's amazing.  These are probably the same people that would scream if you complained about Robert Mapplethorpe's  work.  These are probably the same people that would fight for his right.  To freedom of expression.  Right.  Because you're a homophobe if you find Mapplethorpe repugnant.  When it's a bunch of naked girls, well, now it's a problem.  I mean, here's our favorite term, the workplace.  The workplace.  This is where we create.  Yes.  We come in on a daily basis and talk and get ideas. 
[02:55:00]  And a lot of that is based on our environment.  We can't sit at those cubicles and start talking back and forth and do the show that we do in  here because the atmosphere just isn't conducive to this type of show.  So we come in.  We like the atmosphere.  It's comfortable.  I think you could tell even the first few shows before we really got comfortable in  here, it's a little off.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  And then as time goes by and we add and personalize the studio more, it becomes more familiar and  friendly and more us. 
[02:55:30]  And we do.  So we're able to create better.  It's called a studio because artists work in a studio.  Right.  So go back to your cubicle because that's where you belong.  Yeah.  You are an office dullard and you consider this a workplace.  So go back to the cubicle.  Yeah.  And whatever it is you do in the cubicle is your business.  If you want to go to your closet and conduct an interview, that's what you should do.  Fine.  The little closet office, you should get back in that closet and just begin interviewing people. 
[02:56:00]  That's where you should do your interviews.  Exactly.  There is a little closet with a little bit of office, with a little bit of microphones.  That's where you can do all your interviews.  That's it.  You know?  Absolutely.  But don't come in here.  Do you think at Broadway, like when they're rehearsing for shows, do you think there's  little things up on the walls and in the dressing rooms?  Do you think maybe there's a picture of, I don't know, some guy with tight abs?  Yeah.  Baryshnikov.  Baryshnikov or something?  Yeah.  Probably give up.  Maybe.  That inspires them. 
[02:56:30]  Sure.  Pair of tights that show off his mule and his bag and his veins.  You don't hear any complaints about that, I'll bet.  Are you talking about Ben?  Oh, I thought you were talking about our own Ben Sparks for a moment.  I can't imagine why they'd be offended.  So what else, Eric?  That was about it?  Didn't they talk to Bruce, the guy that runs the New York office?  That's where this is leading.  So the theater guy, the theater guild guy, is pointing to the pictures of the girls.  Yeah.  He goes, I mean, look at this.  Next time, this all has to be taken down.  It's like, we have to get rid of all of this.  Next time. 
[02:57:00]  Right?  So, like Bruce said, came in and Bruce goes, oh, wait a minute.  Whether you like it or not, these guys run this place.  And until I'm told different, you do not touch anything, you leave it here, and this is their studio.  And Bruce says, oh, we'll just find some other place for you to record.  Very good.  See, Bruce knows.  Thank you, Bruce.  Bruce is a huge fan of the show.  Bruce is the man.  He is the man.  Well, he knows we're not going around, I mean, and telling any, as much as we bust balls or whatever, we're not telling anybody else in the office how, like, we're not pretending we're offended at anything they do or trying to get them to change the way they run business at all. 
[02:57:30]  I would never go into that other studio and care what they're doing.  Ever.  If they were in this studio, I would never care what they were doing.  And if you had to use that studio for something, you'd go in there, use it, and would it matter what was there or hanging up?  None of my business.  Right.  None of your business.  And it's not the guy, it's not the Frank's Place guy that we're talking about.  I actually, I like him.  I see him a lot.  We say hello now.  He's informed.  Yeah.  Well, a little awkwardness at the beginning, and now we're all finding a way to coexist.  Yeah, we don't mind the Oompa Loompa anymore. 
[02:58:00]  Ah, we like him.  There's the Oompa Loompa update.  We don't mind him anymore.  Because I nod at him now.  Again.  I'm almost to the point where I'm going to actually say hi.  I nod, though.  We are arrogant dickheads.  And in fairness, we really are.  We came in here, and look, here was the attitude.  Hello, little man.  Beat it.  Take your sign down and tell your story walking.  We were kind of dickheads about it.  I'll acknowledge that.  I certainly was.  Sure.  Walking around the office talking to Bruce.  I can't wait to get these shitty cubicles out of here so bands can come in and play.  Sorry, I know you've been working and sweating here. 
[02:58:30]  So, all right, I can see why some people wouldn't like us.  All right.  You walked around all cocksure.  Or, speaking of...  Cock of the walk, Ant.  Cock of the walk.  Although, I'm sure that wouldn't offend certain people.  Just speculating.  I don't have anybody in mind, of course.  Yuck.  Speaking of making friends, Anthony.  Making friends every day on this show.  You want to explain what we did the other day with the sex videos?  This is a huge faux pas.  We kind of screwed up, Jimmy. 
[02:59:00]  Well, don't say what we did yet.  Oh, I won't.  But for the new listeners, maybe you could recap it.  We had gotten two manila envelopes in the mail, Opie.  One to you, one to me.  We opened them up all excited.  And we get presents all the time.  We're all excited.  And we get presents.  So we opened it up.  And there were about six, seven DVDs in each one that were lessons like sexual courses,  almost, that you could take with these DVDs. 
[02:59:30]  The way you pop the DVD in, and it teaches you how to have sex.  Better sex with your loved one.  How to have sex in a pool.  Remember the sex swing at the office.  The Wade Boggs fella.  Yeah, the Wade Boggs fella.  How to have better sex with your mate.  And it was a whole bunch of these DVDs.  You pop it in.  You watch.  And before you know it, you're learning things and having better sex.  You're having better fellatio and cunnilingus.  They were good.  They were actually very good.  Very good.  And we were watching and commenting on these. 
[03:00:00]  Just destroying the videos.  These things.  And the people that made them.  And how ridiculous.  We weren't giving them rave reviews.  We were goofing on the cast.  Yeah, how awful they looked.  The guy looked like Wade Boggs.  The girl was awful.  I think I screamed, your product is garbage.  Well, that was probably one of the tamer things that was said in the hour and a half that  we spent.  We commented on.  Destroying their product.  What we thought would be the lack of effectiveness of such a product. 
[03:00:30]  Smashing it on the floor.  How awful it was put together.  Yes.  And then the smashing on the console and stomping on them.  Hey, where's that one?  Are we already broken?  Oh, we don't have that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we gave them a good trashing, right?  Yes.  It certainly did.  Well, I got a folder in my hand.  Yes, I see.  What's the folder, Ope?  Well, it's from the fine people at Sinclair Intimacy Institute.  Sinclair Intimacy Institute.  That sounds familiar.  Better relationships, better sex.  Did I say the fine people at Sinclair?  Oh, those are good. 
[03:01:00]  Yes.  Of course you did.  All right.  Really nice letter that I guess came with the videos.  Came with the videos.  So we should have maybe read, but we're not readers.  This letter before we went on the air with these.  We think reading's overrated.  Yeah, it's for facts.  Why read?  Right, Rich?  Hey, I agree 100%.  Dumb readers.  Readers with good vocabularies.  Anthony, the letter is dated December 21st, 2004.  Oh, that's recent. 
[03:01:30]  Dear Ope and Anthony, enclosed in two packages is a little gift from Better Sex to You.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot.  We are starting an advertising relationship with you and your show on XM.  Holy shit.  We are the dumbest sons of bitches.  We are stupid.  We don't think.  We're completely self-absorbed.  I feel right at home.  Why didn't we pull that out and read where it came from? 
[03:02:00]  Instead of opening, this stupid.  Open, this stupid.  How come his dick's not hard?  He looks like Wade Boggs.  What does she shave with?  Miracle-Gro?  Oh, self-destructive scumbag.  Her ass underwater looks like a sea urchin.  Remember all that?  That was a good one.  Yeah, let me back up.  So we are starting an advertising relationship with you and your show on XM, running 60-second  spots with high frequency starting in January.  Oh, good.  I can't wait to hear that. 
[03:02:30]  We look forward to the success that the spots should bring.  Yeah, and Eric, tell everybody where you found the packages.  Crumpled Up in the Garbage.  What packages?  We actually retrieved the packages from the garbage so then we could trash them.  Yeah.  Thanks for having us.  Chris, we've followed the show for quite some time.  Oh, no. 
[03:03:00]  And when we revived our radio campaign earlier this year, you were at the top of our list  for desired partners.  We are dumb little assholes.  Why do we do this?  I don't know.  Is somebody supposed to open that and kind of look through it?  Please find someone to blame it on because we are just little douchebags.  Should it be the, I don't know, is there someone that's supposed to kind of...  Maybe Vince Mark should have perked and jerked the envelope open? 
[03:03:30]  Maybe somebody tried to read it but couldn't get the page.  Couldn't keep it still enough?  Yeah, I don't know what it said.  Perking and jerking his way through.  Do we have audio of us talking about their fine product?  Oh, boy.  Derek in the other studio?  Well, I don't know.  Maybe, um...  Uh-huh.  Well, let's be forward...  Hold on.  Let's hold off there.  Maybe some people from Sinclair were on vacation yesterday?  Ah.  Perhaps, uh...  I look forward to starting this relationship.  We can maybe talk about their product.  Let me tell you, I am so excited... 
[03:04:00]  Very psyched.  ...for them to come on board.  All right.  Because from what I saw on those tapes, there are a lot of people out there that could probably  use a little help in the bedroom.  Sure.  Uh-huh.  And I think the Sinclair Institute is there to help.  Absolutely.  If you want to play third base, um...  It's, uh...  It's very interesting that Anthony just said that, because two days ago, he did this.  Let's give them a little plug.  Uh, you know what?  There you go.  There's your plug.  The Sinclair Institute.  Stinks. 
[03:04:30]  That's good stuff.  Just let it play in the background.  Oh!  Oh!  Jeez!  Oh!  That's great stuff.  Yeah.  Hey, wait.  What's this one?  Oh, the erotic massage.  This is going to be hot.  Garbage!  Is that it?  All right.  That's audio from two days ago.  We are the worst.  We are so dumb.  Maybe someone should have gone.  Let me clarify.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  I was saying that it was broken, so it should go into the garbage.  Right.  And please send another one.  I can use this.  Yes.  Maybe next time someone should give us a heads up, because we could fake anything on  this program.  Jeez, we stink.  We fake excitement every day on this damn show.  All eager.  We opened up the envelopes, looked, and went, this is stupid!  So let me reiterate.  Thanks for having us.  Thanks for having us.  We've followed the show for quite some time, and we revived our radio campaign earlier this  year.  You were at the top of our list for desired partners.  The Sinclair Intimacy Institute and the Better Sex Video Series have been around since 1991, 
[03:05:30]  Anthony.  Oh!  With our product lines, we are dedicated to promoting healthy, happy, and enjoyable sex  to everyone.  And it looked it.  Here's to success in January 2005 and beyond with you guys.  I can't wait for the campaign to start.  I think it's going to be great.  Thanks, John.  Tap into America.  Great.  Oh, my God.  We are asses.  What's the website?  We should give them, certainly, a plug so people can check them out. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Sinclair Institute?  I think it's their website.  It's westink.com.  That should be our website.  I know, Anthony.  I know.  Is that, um...  Boss?  Oh, friggin' rich.  Was that a scumbag?  Ah!  Stop!  That wasn't me.  You heard it.  It was him.  We haven't paid attention to you, so now you've got to fart?  Ooh.  I'm sure who you think it was.  I need a can of Lysol over here.  Anthony heard him do it.  Anthony knows him.  Yes, that was rich.  Yeah, by accident when I stood up.  Oh, by accident. 
[03:06:30]  What do you mean you just stood up?  Your little feet don't touch the floor until when they finally hit and pushed it out of  you?  You shrimp.  Shrimp.  No one said shrimp.  Nice.  When's the last time you heard shrimp?  Shrimp.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You shrimp.  Not hilarious.  I guess.  So there you go.  They're going to be advertisers.  Oh, they are.  Probably starting next week.  Now, that is the first I heard is through an envelope that we got in the mail? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Shouldn't we have heard from somebody at XM?  Of course.  Maybe D or something should have alerted us to the fact that we have an advertiser?  Yeah, that would have been nice.  That really would have been nice.  Maybe we wouldn't have been so harsh.  John in Jersey.  What's up?  Oh, hey, guys.  I just want to say I was listening to the show the other day, and, you know, the sarcasm,  I've been listening to it for a long time.  I bought the Better Sex video because it was so clear that you guys were just goofing  and being sarcastic.  You're right.  Right.  Very good.  You're good. 
[03:07:30]  I just want to thank you guys in advance that you were advertising before you even knew.  It was great.  It was fantastic.  And I'm going to recommend it to friends.  My wife and I are going to watch it.  I'm going to shave it into a mustache, big hair.  It's great.  You're good.  Very good.  Thank you.  Keep up the good work, man.  You guys are great.  Sinclair Institute.  Yeah.  Okay, well, Rich, you have to go, right?  Where are you going, Rich?  I don't know.  Oh, I've got to go home.  You're home?  Well, I've got to catch a train, try to get to my daughter's basketball game, tournament. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, and Daddy's got to be there?  I don't have to.  I'm going to try to get there.  I guess I'm going out of town tomorrow.  That's a good thing to do for daughters, though.  You want to be a dad that's there for her?  I try to go to their games.  If you're not, you know what happens to daughters.  I'm just exhausted.  I've got to leave tomorrow.  How old are your daughters now?  14 and 12.  14 and 12.  They're starting to reach that age now where...  Well, no.  My 14-year-old, they're good kids.  Well, I understand, but they're reaching an age where she's probably starting to take 
[03:08:30]  a real interest in boys.  You know what I made her carry?  Because I was scared of the whole teenage pregnancy thing, right?  So I had her carry like a full-size doll, you know, to show the responsibilities of being  a parent.  Oh, right.  Three days later, I found it in a dumpster.  I go, what are you doing?  She goes, well, I tried to flush it down the toilet, but it wouldn't fit.  They're laughing.  That's not a cricket.  That's a good...  I kind of like to find the baby.  It's topical news.  They just found one in a closed dumpster.  And that just came off the top of my head. 
[03:09:00]  That wasn't like a pre-planned Jenny bit or something.  That just came right out of my head right now.  You got any pictures of your kids?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let me see.  I haven't seen.  I just want to see what type of danger Rich is in.  He's in danger.  For having...  Really?  Yes.  They're very cute as they are.  Is it kind of an up-to-date picture?  Yep.  Let's see.  It's a picture of his cock again that he showed me.  That's wonderful.  What if your kids ever got their hands on your wallet?  What do you mean?  What if they took the picture?  Now you can't see it. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  Because now...  Does your older one have a boyfriend or anybody that you know of?  I don't know.  She's 14.  You know, kids are 14.  They go...  Let me see.  What?  These are older ones.  I don't care.  I just want to see.  They're good kids and they're...  All right.  And they're good looking.  Very cute girls.  Now you got some trouble, Rich.  What's that?  That's trouble.  You know how old she can be?  A couple of years go by.  Uh-huh.  And before you know it, the knock on the door comes and who's there? 
[03:10:00]  Norton.  Norton.  Opie.  No.  Somebody's going to be there.  My kids...  You know...  I don't want to go out with his daughters.  How do you know?  They're very attractive.  They're very smart.  Good dad.  What if they hit 21?  Something like that.  21.  18.  18.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  What are you saying?  How would you feel if somebody, you know, a little older than them came over your house  and wanted to take your daughter out? 
[03:10:30]  It's not going to happen.  My kids...  You know, kids grow up to be good kids because they get attention and affection.  That's all kids need to grow up to be good kids.  That's why we're all screwed up.  I got attention and I got affection.  Yeah, but the wrong way.  There was too many touching.  You know?  You got to know where to draw the line.  Too many touching?  I mean, too much.  Too many touching.  Too many touching.  You can't make a mistake here.  I didn't sleep last night.  So what are you trying to say?  You think...  I'm just saying you are in line.  Yeah, of course.  I got daughters.  In a couple of years, you're going to have trouble because you're going to start seeing 
[03:11:00]  these dopes that are coming over for your daughter.  You had to see the mooks she was with at the mall yesterday.  I mean, you know.  But you know what?  They'll make good decisions, I hope.  A lot better than I did in life.  Because you're such a creep.  It just goes around that they're going to bring home a guy like you.  Right.  It's justice.  A creepy drug addict with a stupid ponytail and a scam.  Crack.  Yeah.  Just do a little crack.  It's nothing.  I remember one time I was doing crack and I was in a bar, like the film center, down on 
[03:11:30]  9th Avenue.  And I'm sitting there and I had like no money left and I had 40 cents for a draft beer  and I didn't know how to get back to Jersey.  I just smoked all my money in crack.  So some girl's sitting staring at me and she comes over and says, can I buy you a drink?  I go, yeah.  And she gave me the money to go up to the bar and get it and I just ran right out the  door for 20 bucks and just kept running.  And I ran and bought two more vials of crack.  I swear to God, it was great.  I used to stand by the tunnel because I knew my friends were coming in from Jersey. 
[03:12:00]  I knew, like I'd have no money and I knew they would drive in and I would stand right  where you come through the tunnel and stop them and make them let me in the car so I  get a ride home and get more free crack.  Oh, I'm sure they were like, hey, there's that upstanding citizen, Rich Voss.  Let's pull over and give him a ride.  But see, the thing is, my kids have never seen me drunk or high, so they know, you know,  a good example.  Yeah.  Why?  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day. 
[03:12:30]  I love midgets.  Oh, right on.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I work at Starbucks and every day in the morning I listen to your shows.  I drive to work.  I've been listening for three years.  And old show, too.  And so yesterday, you know, very, very, very busy.  The whole store is packed beyond capacity.  And I have this tall white peppermint mocha here.  You know, I know Norton likes Starbucks because we're not Spanish and we make a coffee, right?  Yep.  And so I'm asking questions, you know, whipped cream or sprinkle, all this crap that goes 
[03:13:00]  on the drink.  And I'm asking questions.  No one's responding.  All of a sudden, this little head with a little, like a Robin Hood Archer cap pokes up from  the counter with little fingers over the counter.  It just goes, yes, I would like whipped cream with, you know, all this crap.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  It's like the smallest drink we make, the tall.  The tall.  And then I pass it to him.  As I pass it to him, first of all, he can't reach the counter where he passed it to.  Oh, he's probably just straining on his little tippy toes, like trying to get up there with 
[03:13:30]  those nasty little fingers trying to get up there.  Looking around for a boost.  Oh, can someone help me?  Someone help me over here.  I can't quite reach the counter.  That big, tall counter they put your drink on at Starbucks?  The best part, guys, he's black.  Oh.  So it's like an unusual midget setting.  Why?  What's unusual about that?  Well, I've never seen.  The call's coming from Boston, so.  Ah.  He was in the wrong part of Boston, okay? 
[03:14:00]  We say we're here.  The tall part.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Yep.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  I know there was a midget section of Boston.  Shorty, they call it.  Well, we should.  I think we should regroup.  Should we say goodbye to you?  Nah, I can hang out.  Hang out.  Oh.  Can I say.  I can read you.  This guy.  No.  Let me tell you what's going on with Rich Voss.  I can read you.  No, you can't.  You had a really good appearance on the show, so you should step out.  Oh, right now? 
[03:14:30]  I know what you're thinking.  What?  He wanted to leave at 10 to 9, he told me.  Yeah.  It's now what?  10 after.  But you know the last few minutes that you were on the air wasn't that good, and you want  to leave on an up-not.  No, no.  It wasn't bad.  I guarantee that's the reason.  No, here's the thing.  Come on.  Admit it.  First of all.  We're all going to get emails.  I did pretty good today, didn't I?  No, first of all, I had some great lines.  I did what I was supposed to.  You know, they think, oh, you're a comment.  Did you or did you not want to leave at 10 to 9?  You did?  Well, yeah, I did, but I figured since it was going.  First of all. 
[03:15:00]  Did you or did you not feel like the last few minutes on the air wasn't that good for  you?  Well, it wasn't killer, but here's the thing.  Here's the thing, okay?  Let me tell you.  He started bringing up the kids.  I didn't know if there was some surprise attack or, you know, four big black guys here were  dating your daughter or some attack.  I just wanted to know how you were feeling about your daughter getting older and attractive.  It's just, it's great.  You know what?  It's all conversation.  It's great.  Well, because here's the thing, too.  When people listen to these radio shows, you know, you're a comic.  They think you've got to be funny every fucking two minutes.  Enough of that bullshit.  When an actor comes in here, do they do scenes, all right? 
[03:15:30]  We're talking, all right?  I'm funny on stage.  Once in a while, I'll throw something out good, all right?  I took a fucking train here, and I didn't sleep.  So, you know what?  You throw a couple lines out.  You can swim in.  But when you start talking about my kids, I didn't know, you know.  I don't want to leave.  You're not going to make fun of your kids?  No.  Of course you're going to make fun of them.  Or use it as a gag or anything.  And we'll wait to leave, and then we'll talk about it.  Oh, you can trash me all you want.  I don't mind that.  You know, as long as you...  Oh, fuck it.  Yeah, I did want to leave on a better note than...  I know.  I did.  At least a minute.  At least a minute. 
[03:16:00]  You did have a really good appearance, but at least a minute that you want to end up on  a really up note.  Yeah, I guess.  Can Marion or Die call in?  I can trash you real quick and get out of here.  Well, if you want to stick around, you can.  If not, just leave.  No one will care.  I can't catch the train now.  I missed it.  Wait, before we go, I got to say, I got to do it, bro.  BetterSex.com.  A nice plug for our friends at the Sinclair Institute.  BetterSex.com.  Check them out.  We're a bunch of dummies.  We all know that. 
[03:16:30]  It's a little mash-up that people seem to enjoy.  It's the Doors and Blondie getting together here, okay?  All right.  And if Rich is gone, anything you want to plug?  Well, if I'm...  Oh, I'm getting...  Well, no.  You're not getting kicked out.  You know that.  Well, no.  I mean, I'm at Pittsburgh Improv this week for New Year's.  Cool.  Rich Voss DVD.  Did you guys see my DVD yet?  No.  That can't be bothered.  It's good.  I know.  Times Square, I thought you were doing this year, no?  Weren't you doing the Jewish show or something in Times Square?  That was last week.  Oh, okay.  I don't...  You know, I come in to have a good time. 
[03:17:00]  I don't plug.  I don't need that plug-in shit anymore.  My name's so...  I am such a team player.  I am such a sprounce.  I am such a sprounce on.  Check this out.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back.  We'll be back. 
[03:17:30]  We'll be back.  Into this house we're born  Into this world we're thrown  Like a dog without a bone  An actor out of bone  Riders on the storm  There's a killer on the road  His brain is squirming like his nose 
[03:18:00]  Take a long holiday  Let your children play  If you give this man a ride  Sweet family will die  You're on the road  Yeah 
[03:18:30]  You're on the road

[03:28:00]  You know, did you notice that Master Poe greeted us differently today, Anthony?  I did.  Now, why is that?  I guess he heard the show yesterday.  Yeah, but we really didn't say anything.  I noticed that you kind of lucked out because something happened, interrupted us,  talking about the morning ritualistic fist-punch greeting.  Well, when Master Poe arrives, everyone knows it because he walks around the whole place  and he says hi to everybody and he gives everyone a little fist of acknowledgement. 
[03:28:30]  You know, you bang knuckles together.  That he's here, and I just don't like that because I'm quite moody and agitated when we get here in the morning  because we're barely awake and we're trying to show prep our asses off for 45 minutes.  You're just like being left alone in the morning.  And you don't?  Sitting in there reading the paper.  You don't?  You're kind of in your own world.  And then to have anybody come up, anything, a pat on the back, even a how you're doing.  Nothing against him.  You know, I just want to be, you know, left alone until I wake up, have a little more coffee, you know? 
[03:29:00]  We get in the zone for the radio show, right?  What's this we?  Oh, my God.  You hate it, too, dude.  I've never said a word about it.  You notice today he came into our office and he just kind of bowed.  That's going to be his new thing.  He's bowing.  No more, you know, little quick fist things.  It's like the greeting you would give to an opponent in a karate match.  Right.  You bow.  I don't mind the fist.  Handshakes, you can get, like, sick from a handshake. 
[03:29:30]  It can drive me nuts.  But there's no germs on people's knuckles?  No, not really.  No one does anything with this.  And I don't put my fist in my mouth.  I'm not five or retarded.  I don't chew my knuckle.  Well, it started with, it did start with handshakes.  And then we said, look, you know, we're weird and germaphobe, so if you could maybe do a little fist thing.  And then I wasn't liking that.  And I was, like, trying to have things in my hand every time he came into the office, but that wasn't working too well.  I was going to have, like, an ice cream cone in one hand and, like, a hot cup of tea in the other.  Cup of tea.  Right. 
[03:30:00]  So, oh, dude, I'd love to do that today, but my hands are full.  I hope he's reading the paper juggling.  Right.  Like anything to just, oh, I'm a little busy.  Coughing against his knuckles on purpose.  Right.  Right.  There's nothing, you know, against the guy.  Just, you know, I don't know.  So no more fists.  Why don't you, you know, from now on every morning, you just do a little docking.  A little docking.  Two men just stand nose to nose and do a little docking.  I don't know if either one of you is unclipped.  You know, when you bow, you've got to bow back, though.  That's the whole Chinese thing.  Oh, Rich Voss being what belt? 
[03:30:30]  What belt?  Yeah, what belt, Karate?  Purple.  You're still in the, like, the brightly color.  You're still, what's the word?  Fucking no improv skills.  Faggot I am.  Damn it.  It's a word.  What are you talking about?  I'm trying to think of a color.  Vibrant?  Vibrant belt?  Fuchsia?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There is master foam.  Bring him in.  A descriptive word for colors.  You just don't want to bow because you're scared of...  A descriptive word for colors?  Yes.  I'm not colors.  Oh. 
[03:31:00]  There he is.  Master foam.  He's in the studio, everyone.  Hey, guys.  Happy holiday.  So there's no offense, right?  None whatsoever.  But you were bowing today.  Yes.  We kind of like that one.  Does the greeting, you know, like you would on the mat.  Right.  Yeah, that's before you go into a match.  Right.  Before you fight.  Full contact.  Blindfolded.  I saw a karate kid.  Blindfolded?  I don't know how that's done. 
[03:31:30]  What belt are you?  I'm no belt now.  What belt were you?  Brown.  How good is that?  It's not bad.  It's right before black.  It is?  Yeah, he's ready.  What's the first belt you get just for showing up at the dojo?  Depends on what school you go to.  In my school, you don't receive anything.  Oh, really?  You have to earn your white belt.  You have to earn your white belt.  But belts don't mean anything.  It's how good you are.  Some teachers just throw you belts to keep you coming, and it doesn't matter what belt  you are.  Voss, last time you were here, you demonstrated some of your karate moves.  No, but I... 
[03:32:00]  Could you do another one for us?  They weren't bad, though.  Voss can kick for a little fella.  I forgot about that.  My legs are tight.  I might be able to throw something.  Is there a little demonstration you think you could do with him?  I mean, something...  You do a lot of advanced stuff with Mars.  As long as he doesn't move.  I understand that.  No, no.  Like, maybe something...  What could Voss do right now to show off his skills?  As long as he doesn't move, he'll be okay.  If he moves, he'll...  No, no, no.  No, because I don't want you to do the advanced stuff on Voss, because he will get hurt.  He's a little guy.  He's a little guy.  Look, he's sitting back down.  He's getting scared.  I don't want to be one of these guys, you know, radio guests. 
[03:32:30]  We understand that.  But, you know, that could happen like that easily.  Can he do a...  What could he do?  Could you hold up something that he could kick or something?  Just something very...  I could do something.  Something very simple.  I could see how fast he is.  How?  It's a game that we play.  Oh, you guys are...  What's the game?  No, we don't.  It's very simple.  You're going to place your hands in front of you.  Yeah.  And you're going to slap my hand as quickly as you can.  Oh, that one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a game.  All right, let's see this.  All right?  All right. 
[03:33:00]  And all I'm going to do is just tap your stomach.  I'm not going to hit your stomach.  I'm just going to tap your stomach.  What do I got to do?  Tell me what I got to do.  You're going to slap my hand.  Here we go.  We need to mic these guys.  Where's Eric or Ben?  Oh, hey, use this one.  Use this one.  You guys are setting me up.  No, we're not.  No, it's no setup.  No, it's set me up, Rich.  All right.  Conspiracy theorist.  Wait, what's going on here?  Let's get these guys mic'd.  Master Paul, what's going to happen now?  Hold up.  You got to get a mic.  We love these demonstrations, and Voss is helping out today.  So we're going to see how fast Voss is, I guess.  Well, in a martial arts, there's certain aspects of the arts that you need, and speed is one 
[03:33:30]  of them.  And this is a drill that we work on, and it builds your speed.  All right.  You can tell me what I got to do first in slow motion.  I don't know what you're doing, though.  Neither do I.  What actually has to be done?  I know what he's going to do.  One more time.  Voss is going to place his hands in front of him.  Apart.  Apart.  Apart.  Like he's describing a fish size. 
[03:34:00]  Shoulder width apart, even.  Shoulder width apart, looking like he's saying, I caught one this big.  Frankenstein.  Exactly.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to place my hands in front of him.  In front of him.  And my hand has to go through his hands.  We haven't started yet.  Through his hands, touch his stomach.  Right.  Without him touching me.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  So all he has to do is clap his hands onto your hand before your hand gets to his stomach.  That's all he has to do.  All right.  Can you just make him truly the last comic standing for us?  I won't hurt you.  I won't hurt you.  And you do it nine out of ten times. 
[03:34:30]  See how many times you can actually hit someone out of ten.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Let's set up here.  All right.  Tell me.  Rich, put your hands apart.  Wait, where do I go?  I'm just putting my...  Yeah.  You just have to slap his...  He ain't going to hit you, Rich.  He's just tapping.  He's just tapping.  Don't worry so much.  I promise you.  Don't put...  Where are you putting your hands?  Right in front of me.  All right.  Okay.  Ready?  Okay.  Just right here.  Oh, he's just going to sneak it through to see if you can clap it.  I'm going to place my hand right through your stomach.  Yeah.  Right through your stomach. 
[03:35:00]  And bring it back.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Oh, look at it.  He's panicking already.  That's a rough one, though.  Jesus.  He's panicking.  Poe's getting in position, man.  Yep.  Wow.  One.  That was fast.  He missed that one, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Totally missed.  0 for 2, Voss.  Oh, great.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Poe's fast.  What I can do to say to him, I'll get through on him, too. 
[03:35:30]  You think so?  Oh, yeah?  Well, you'll try it next.  Oh, good.  Oh, for 5.  He can't get his hand before it hits Voss's chest.  And then he brings the hand all the way out.  Poe's actually signing an autograph in between, and Voss can't hit him.  Now Voss is closing the distance.  0 for 7.  Hey, Voss, leave your hands together and see if you can just snake him through your epidermals.  0 for 8.  8?  Was that close, at least?  That one was...  All right.  Here we go.  Oh.  9. 
[03:36:00]  Almost.  Oh, 10.  Oh, for 10.  Wow.  It didn't hurt, though, right?  Master Poe went through all the way to Voss's chest and back out before Voss could slap  his hands.  No, I got my...  On the way back.  Three of those, he hit him a little hard in the chest.  Did he?  That wasn't hard.  Did he?  He's fine.  He looked a little hard.  I saw some smoke come out of you.  Voss, why don't you try this?  Why don't you...  Let's try full contact.  Why don't you try the same thing on Master Poe?  I can't control myself, but he can, you know.  He's afraid that he'll slip and hit Master Poe in the sternum and then Poe will decapitate 
[03:36:30]  him.  I'll do it one time.  I'll get one through.  Okay.  All right.  One through?  You think I'll get one through?  Yeah, that's fine.  Just use your hand like this, though.  Don't put a fist.  All right.  Just use that little...  All right.  So now the same thing, Master Poe is...  Now all you got to do is put it through, right?  Yeah.  Although he's quick, though, right?  Yes, he is.  That's one in?  Yeah.  You got one?  Yeah, of course.  I couldn't see.  I always got to do this hand.  Do whatever hand you want.  He doesn't care.  Oh, wow.  Is that...  Rich is pretty fast.  Holy crap. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  0 for 3.  Voss is quick.  0 for 4.  Voss is quicker than we thought.  Oh.  Now he's getting cocky.  Yeah.  All cocky.  Now he's caunting him and dancing.  Doing combinations.  Calm down, Allie.  Jesus.  This is where it starts.  Wow.  Voss is quick, though.  I think he was playing possum.  No.  He's got him there.  You know he's going to have to kill you now, boss, because you just showed him up. 
[03:37:30]  No, no, no.  Now the next drill.  This is a very simple drill.  We're going to see how many...  You're not mad at me.  No, no.  I don't even mad at you.  You're my friend.  Rich.  Yeah.  I want you to, without hitting me in the face, hurting me, I want you to throw as many punches  as you can towards my face, and they will count it.  They will count your punches.  Okay?  What do you mean?  Wait.  You're going to throw as many punches as you can within five seconds.  Five.  Within five seconds time.  Even ten seconds. 
[03:38:00]  Whatever you want.  What do you mean?  Like that?  Like...  Yeah, as many times.  Two hands.  Just punch towards his face without hitting it.  By the way, Rich did a fantastic job.  Yes.  Fantastic job.  Let's do...  It's got to be easier, though, when your arms are that short.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's like a short distance to travel.  I can't box with God at all.  You're going to throw as many punches as you can within five seconds.  If someone can do a time...  All right.  Okay?  Five seconds time.  You are quick at that.  Again, this is a speed drill.  It's a speed drill.  Like you're hitting a speed back. 
[03:38:30]  All right, here we go.  Okay, to my face.  I might count.  I might count.  I'm not going to hurt you, Rich.  Come on.  Are you ready?  All right.  I'm ready.  But I'm not coming close.  Just do it for an hour.  Ready?  I'm not moving.  If you hit me, that's my problem.  No, no, no, no.  My hands are on my side.  All right.  You ready, Rich, or what?  You're not going to hit him, Rich.  We don't have all day.  Relax.  Ready, set, go.  Like that?  Is that what you're talking about?  Yeah, but you've got to do it for another three, four seconds.  Without passing out.  Yeah, you've got to keep going until we say stop.  This is a drill. 
[03:39:00]  Who's going to count?  It looks like he's not going to do anything.  We're just seeing how many times you can punch in five seconds.  But what's this saying?  Someone's counting?  Yes, we are.  We are, sweetie.  Who's counting, by the way?  I'm three.  I'll count three.  Who's counting them?  I'll count.  Someone count.  I'm looking at the clock.  We'll do it for five seconds.  Just punch until we say stop.  Five whole seconds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Ready?  All right.  Ready, and go.  That's two seconds.  First of all, it's two seconds.  But you didn't even punch.  You just rolled your arms in a circle like they did the little rascals? 
[03:39:30]  How many?  How many?  I couldn't tell because he was just rolling them in a circle.  That was about ten.  Maybe ten?  Okay.  Maybe ten?  Rich, you know you're my friend, right?  Yeah, yeah, why?  Okay, just don't move.  Don't move?  Don't move.  Don't move.  No, don't.  I'm going to hitch you.  You just cost a lot of money to these people.  Don't move.  Don't move.  I promise I'm going to hitch you.  Yeah, but sometimes people slip.  It does this all the time.  What are they doing?  I've been doing this since I was five.  I'm not going to slip.  That's right.  He's eight now.  Norton's been sucking dicks since he was five. 
[03:40:00]  It doesn't make him a pro.  Well, at least I never tried to put my dick through someone's hands and I clapped at it.  Glad that got a laugh.  That was a really energetic one to bomb.  Yeah.  It had a little motion in it.  It was a visual.  Get on like hats.  What are we doing?  Standing still.  All right.  Just don't move.  Are we going to try to count how many times you hit?  That ain't going to happen.  What's the sense in it?  This is a speed drill.  All it is is a speed drill.  All right.  Here we go.  You don't really need me here.  Oh, yeah, I do.  He does.  He does.  I ain't going to hit you, man.  I ain't going to hit you.  Thank Jesus. 
[03:40:30]  Please don't hit Rich.  I hope he clocks it hard.  Oh.  Those horse teeth.  Look at those quickies.  Look at that.  They fly out like buckshot.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Hit an explosion at the chicklets factory.  Promise me you won't move.  Just leave.  Do you want to move backwards?  No, don't move.  Don't move at all.  Don't move.  Don't move.  If you're not comfortable with this, I'll get Marcellino.  Get Marcellino.  I think it would be.  Oh, no, Rick.  Just don't move.  Don't move.  Yeah, name Marcellino.  That's all you got to do.  Now, if Ben was doing this, it would be dangerous.  He's incapable of not moving.  Just five seconds. 
[03:41:00]  Don't move.  If you panic, Voss, if you panic, just close your eyes.  He's not going to hit you.  One more seconds.  Yeah, let's do it.  Two seconds.  All right, just lean in, Rich.  Oh, Jesus.  Whoa, look at that.  He's got to quit that one.  Yeah.  It nipped me.  Right there on the lip.  No, it didn't.  No, it was good.  It was, yeah.  Okay, that was two seconds.  Yeah, that was holy.  All right, here we go.  Let him do five.  Here you go.  Just don't hit him, though.  Yeah, don't hit him.  Watch how fast this is.  We can't have Voss hit him.  I know this is radio, but.  We can't have Voss hit him.  No, Rich is a great guy.  All right, here we go.  That's my future.  He's going to attempt, I don't know what he's attempting.  After Bonnie dumps him, he'll come back to me. 
[03:41:30]  Here we go.  Ready, set, go.  Oh, my God.  Done.  That is fast.  Very nice.  All right.  You don't even have to describe it.  You can hear it over the radio how fast that was.  That was a flutter of injuries.  His hands are like lightning.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  And Voss did stand there and just take it without flinching like I would have, which was nice. 
[03:42:00]  No, he didn't move.  Yeah, but it's not like you have a chin he could hit, so you don't have to worry.  That's pretty good.  He's a great martial artist.  Who?  You.  No, I used to be, and I didn't work.  All right.  What did you say about my chin?  I like your chin.  All right.  Thank you, Master Paul.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, Paul.  Very, very good.  Our hired assassin.  Man, you just heard that flutter of death.  You see how quick my voice is that, too?  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, now he's talking smack.  No, I've been talking smack.  It's not going to hurt.  Yeah.  What?  Do I not move?  What do I do?  It's not going to hurt.  And Paul leaves.  He's done.  He walks over here.  See how fast my hands were?  Maybe I should call Bonnie first to make sure it's okay to do this.  Two minutes ago, it was like, look, do I have to put the dress on?  I don't want to, but I'll wear the ribbon if you say so.  You know, if you guys wanted me to kick, that was another story.  Hey, Martini Steve.  We got the video up.  I'll point you, Steve.  Yeah.  We got the video up yet?  Assault on the media with Eric.  No, it will be. 
[03:43:00]  It will be at the end of the show.  All right.  We got great audio of Eric getting huge O&A signs on Good Morning America.  It will be up on opianthony.com later today.  Boss, you have to leave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to get a trip.  I'm going to train after that, you know, demonstration and stuff.  I'm going to go have a cigarette.  You got to quit smoking.  I know.  That guy is quick.  You see how quick that was?  Yeah, he's very quick.  And he could do it for more than, you know, two seconds.  The guy's doing a pretty long second straight.  And they're accurate and they're hard punches.  Oh.  On the elbow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd be done.  It would happen so fast if you got into a fight with him. 
[03:43:30]  You hitting the ground, you'd be like, what the?  What?  What?  A tsunami of punches, dare I say.  Martini was telling me one of the things he'll do, and I asked Paul about this, and he confirmed  it, is he'll put his fingers in your mouth and fishhook your mouth.  And he says, you don't put them in too far so someone can bite you.  But, like, you grab the inside of their lip and just, their cheek and just yank.  And he told me how he would yank.  And it would just rip your cheek muscle off your face.  Of course.  Oh, man.  And Mars goes, yeah, he'll, like, twist your arm and hurt your arm the other direction 
[03:44:00]  and then just pop up and grab you by that cheek and just rip.  So when you're concentrating on, oh, my arm, I got, oh, my mouth.  Paul is an animal.  Like, and then your nuts would be inside your body and you'd have a foot in your ass.  No, it sucks.  We could never fire the guy.  He'll bite you.  We'll kill you.  He'll kill us.  He could demand raises whenever he wants.  I think I'm being paid enough.  I think you're right.  We'll take it out of pocket.  Don't let me kill you.  Just mug us when we walk in every day.  Yeah.  Give me your lunch money.  If you go to prison, there's dudes that tough and bad in prison, like you have no shot. 
[03:44:30]  You know, if they want to bang you, they're going to bang you.  You know what I'm saying?  You keep thinking that.  I would fight back.  You would fight back?  You on the other hand would let him put the cock right by your face.  All right, just don't hit me with it.  You would fight back.  Yes.  All right, put it between my lips and I'll try to smack down on it.  Of course I'd fight back.  I would lose.  You would fight back.  No, I would just give him the ass and go, all right, go ahead, respect me.  They wouldn't want your ass to say titty-fuck you first.  You see how cute his girlfriend is?  What's the first impression I left on her? 
[03:45:00]  I drooled right away.  Oh, you do.  She's my girlfriend.  She's a very lovely girl.  The boss went to say something clever and just drool, flew out of his mouth.  Oh, God.  I love when he does it on a table.  Well, she has braces.  I just wanted to make her feel at home.  She's a cutie.  Okay, I'm ending on a real sour note again.  Oh, it looks like you're going to stink.  Hey, thanks.  What is this first gay retarded porno thing?  Could you leave my mic up during the replay?  Someone emailed me that.  Oh, you got this one here, too?  I actually brought this in. 
[03:45:30]  You brought this in?  Maybe I had to get another copy sent to you, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  It says, Dear ONA, my name is Cal Berducci, I guess.  I'm a stand-up comic and I live in Jersey.  This is a skit from my comedy CD called The First Gay Retarded Porno.  You'll find that it's sick and twisted and crosses pretty much every effing line.  It would be perfect for your show.  If you like it, shoot me an email.  How many comics come out of Jersey?  Then someone writes a post-it on this.  Whose handwriting is this?  Steve.  Steve.  And Steve writes, Awful Comic from New Jersey.  Uh-oh.  Well, it says gay retarded porno. 
[03:46:00]  I was so disappointed when it was audio.  Gay retarded porno?  Oh, I thought it was going to be a couple of...  Pop that DVD right in.  Big fucking curly pubic-haired, like pigtail pubes, dummies.  Not knowing how wrong what they were doing was.  Confused at how good it feels.  You know, and yet somehow instinctively knowing that it's wrong.  Oh.  Both getting pleasure from those big fat tongues.  Huh?  I'm going to be here in a second.  Oh, he'll be here in a second.  Okay.  We'll be here.  Not like this is live radio right now. 
[03:46:30]  Steve.  I'll just wait.  Well, can Steve get off the phone?  That O.B. and Anthony would like him.  There he is.  Why did you write Awful Comic from Jersey on this one?  It's an Awful Comic from Jersey.  You hate this, right?  I don't...  Well, I don't hate it, but I'm fairly indifferent to it.  Was it funny?  No.  Not even remotely.  All right.  We get stuff like this all the time.  Well, the guy was proud of it and...  Well, good.  Let him be.  Saying he thinks it'll be good for our show.  It's on his comedy CD.  It's right up our alley, I believe.  Good for him.  Good for him.  And what is it?  Is it stand-up? 
[03:47:00]  No, it's like one of those recorded bits, you know how like...  Is it a skit?  Yeah, I think it's...  Oh, we don't do skits, stupid.  Yes.  Starts off with an awful walking.  Let's say that once.  Yeah, a very terrible walking impression and goes into a little gay skit.  How do you really feel?  It's Jay Moore.  I don't like it.  It's subpar.  It's subpar.  Is it a Christopher Walken impression or is it Jay Moore's impression of walking?  It's like a bad impression of Jay doing...  Yeah.  ...walking.  Yeah.  All right.  Walk.  Let's take a listen.  Fuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Christopher Walken. 
[03:47:30]  We now present for you...  Oh, all right.  Already.  Okay.  Wow, that didn't take long.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, great stuff.  You know what?  Maybe it took him a little bit to get geared up into the Walken impression.  Maybe it took me a little bit.  Hello.  This is Christopher Walken. 
[03:48:00]  Hello.  I got no voice inflection.  None whatsoever.  Oof.  Fuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Christopher Walken.  We now present for you the world's first gay retarded porno.  Caught from behind 2, Corky's Revenge.  Okay.  Terrific.  My name is Corky.  What's yours?  Corky's Revenge.  What is the...  Gay...  I think we stepped on what the actual thing is.  Gay retarded porno.  Gay retarded porno starring what?  Corky?  Corky. 
[03:48:30]  From Life Goes On.  It's called Corky's Revenge.  And can I say as far as impressions goes, Ben does a better impression of a quadriplegic.  Fuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Christopher Walken.  We now present for you the world's first gay retarded porno.  Caught from behind 2, Corky's Revenge.  Hi.  My name is Corky.  What's yours?  My name is Lenny.  You're sexy. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you.  I let your wheelchair.  Really?  Boss, be quiet.  Take your clothes off, bitch.  Cause mom just got a sprenu.  It's not funny, but it's sexy.  Get over, bitch.  I want to play with your sphincter.  My sphincter?  I didn't bring it with me.  You got me, you asshole.  Oh my god.  That's funny.  I like hot dogs.  What's my sphincter again?  Okay, terrific. 
[03:49:30]  You're ass.  Don't go for me, man.  I'm going to start fucking it.  Bend over.  What are you doing?  That's my belly button.  It smells like your asshole.  I don't wash very well.  Spank my shoulder.  Spank my neck.  Who's your stepfather?  His name is Frank.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot.  Who's your cousin?  Who's your cousin?  Larry.  Don't laugh when you're fucking me. 
[03:50:00]  You're a dick and you're a dick.  I think I broke it.  Let me catch it.  Ow, ow, ow.  You're a dick.  Stokey.  No, no, no, no.  I'm so divided.  Play with my balls.  No, don't squeeze.  Come on.  You're going to pop them.  They're not charming.  At least it doesn't go on long.  Look at the kitty.  Is that your kitty?  No, that's my ass. 
[03:50:30]  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  I'm going to make my cobra spit.  Really?  I'm going to continue with my mom.  Wait a second.  That looks like your dick is snowing.  By the way, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener. 
[03:51:00]  Okay, terrific.  It's over, Johnny.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  It sucks.  That was, uh...  That...  Okay.  ...was horrid.  Thank you.  Oh, Opie, did you read the letter that came with it?  No.  He's a sponsor.  He's starting in January.  He's going to be a sponsor.  God!  Was that ponderous?  You didn't think that was a good bit? 
[03:51:30]  Shut up.  Don't even start.  I don't know.  It kind of had all the elements of good comedy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't like the gay stuff, though.  You know, it's like kind of having a...  I know somebody might be offended at that.  Ah, that's true.  Making fun of the gay people.  Mm-hmm.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  A lot of retarded on Broadway.  They would be offended.  All right, well...  Oof.  I'm trying to read the...  Yeah, turn it off.  Play the train clip.  That sucks.  I saw this movie.  It starred Juliette Lewis. 
[03:52:00]  No.  Bring Voss back.  Bring Voss back.  I thought that was Voss.  I thought that was Voss.  All right, well...  Wow.  All right, well, keep trying there, fella.  Let's say hi to Tony in Reno.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, what's up, Owen and Jim?  Hi, Tony.  Thanks for calling from the good old West Coast time zone.  How are you?  I'm really tired.  I've been up all night playing COH, City Heroes, and trying to level up.  For Anthony there.  You've been playing what?  I don't play the Cities of Heroes.  COH, Cities of Heroes. 
[03:52:30]  I know as much about games as you know about prostitutes.  So when they say things like that, COH, wow, you know, W-O-W, it's a little different  than Whip them Out Wednesday.  World of Warcraft.  And I just got another sticker for the back of my car.  Can you believe that?  I got two now, and I only asked for one.  Very good.  I want to say hi to...  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  I want to say hi to Lil' Jimmy, who was logged on to EverQuest 2 last night.  A character came on and called Lil' Jimmy, and he spelled something wrong when he was 
[03:53:00]  talking to me, and he said, oh, great, now I'm spelling like that idiot Voss.  And for 10 minutes, we just ripped Voss apart on this game.  Just chatting back and forth.  They're a Jigsaw, and my son, he's a 10-year-old.  I can't remember the name of this guy, because he's kept some funky-ass name.  But he wants to be like Master Poe when he grows up.  So, anyway.  Anyway, I had a nervous titter of laughter as he bombs.  Guys, I've been up all night. 
[03:53:30]  Hey, thanks for the call, Harry Chapin.  Yeah, you don't deserve to play What Have We Learned Today.  Okay.  He's all right.  All right, now, go ahead.  Can you teach me how to play Max Payne?  Hey, what sucks after breast cancer is you can't baby feed, and Voss's mom can never have  enough crockpots.  That's pretty good.  Thank you.  Let's go to Atlanta.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I learned today that you can buy a baby in the microwave for three seconds.  Very nice.  From the ATL.  Yes.  Yukon, the trucker. 
[03:54:00]  Yukon?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  Hey, my little fecal lumberjack.  Hello, my little marmalade spreader.  Hey, I learned that Voss makes Corky sound like a Shakespearean actor.  Oh, you're giving him the car crash?  Yeah.  That got nothing.  All right.  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, Golden Buns?  Hi.  How are you, Rob from Long Island?  Thanks for calling the program this morning. 
[03:54:30]  No problem.  It's like, yeah, the only thing worse than a woman trying to drown your baby is not letting  you titty fuck her when she's done.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Oh, you hear me go, like he didn't think he got it out right.  No, he did great.  Yeah, he did great.  Rich, what's up?  Yo, guys, I learned two things today.  I learned that Rich Voss is the new Michael Jackson, who has a picture of their cock.  And, um, uh, shit, I forgot my other one.  Oh, my God. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, my God.  What a pileup we're getting here, and what did we learn?  What the hell's going on here?  Wayne in New York, what's up?  That was awful.  How you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that if you want to advertise on the show, you should, uh, tell you guys  before sending your shit in.  Get us out of this.  It's just a fog-strewn highway.  Wow.  New Year's Eve on the Autobahn.  I can't see. 
[03:55:30]  What?  Oh, no.  What is that?  Awful.  Uh, Wade in New Hampshire.  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, cucka chest.  How you doing, Wade?  Loved you in the video.  Hey.  I don't know what that means.  I know.  That's why you uncomfortably laugh.  What?  I don't want to.  You should have just said LOL.  That would have had more, uh.  I don't want to seem stupid, so I'll just go.  Smile and nod.  All right.  Go ahead, Wade.  Today I learned, Opie, that whenever you screw a word up, you piss and moan about having 
[03:56:00]  a tummy ache or a headache or making up a reason why you screwed the word.  You can't just take it like a man like the other two do.  I'll take it.  I learned that it's R before N today.  There you go.  Oh.  Governing.  We couldn't get past Governing.  He's gubernatorialing.  I said it three times, too.  Like, no, this has to make sense.  Governing.  Governing.  Yeah.  Governor's Island.  Oh, brother.  All right.  Jason, another one from New Hampshire.  Two in a row.  Jason, go ahead.  Hey.  Today I learned my belly button smells like an asshole. 
[03:56:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  Bob the trucker.  What's up?  Yeah.  I learned today that baby is a dish best served newt.  Ooh.  Very nice.  He loves his stuff.  He's laughing.  Glenn on Long Island.  What's up?  Glenn?  Yeah.  All right.  He blew his chance.  Who's this?  Hello?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up?  We don't have your name, so what's your name?  I learned that Rich Ross.  It's Rich from The Legacy. 
[03:57:00]  Okay.  I learned that Rich Ross needs to find that director and bring her around with her.  What?  Princess guy.  Oh.  Marty from New York.  What's up, Marty?  Hey, Owen.  Hey.  Glad to have you back.  I learned today that Jersey has earned the title of most unfunny state in the nation.  Yeah.  They were very unfunny today.  Very good.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Tony from Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned today that after another outstanding Rich Ross performance, he owes all of us seven  sons. 
[03:57:30]  Wow.  Uh, very good.  A lot of pennies.  Let's say hi to Mike in Nebraska.  Mike, what's up?  Not much.  All right.  Well, Mike, you want to say something?  Yeah, I learned today that Opie needs a surgeon to remove his foot from his mouth on his comments  about your sponsor.  Well, no.  It was all of us.  We all blew that one.  Okay.  Well, especially Opie.  We did, but you shouldn't have.  Actually, I didn't trash him as bad as Jimmy and Arpity.  You shouldn't have bailed out his awful foot-and-mouth reference. 
[03:58:00]  I know.  By dignifying it with a real response.  All right.  T-Bone from Boston.  I learned today that Mrs. McGreevy came up with an interesting new microwave recipe.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station today learned you can't titty-fuck mommy after she nukes  the baby.  Yeah, we got that one out already.  And Pat from Munaki writes, Voss will be opening up for Pat from Munaki at the Comedy Cellar all  this week.  What?  He's bombing in print. 
[03:58:30]  He continues to bomb.  He should stick what he's good at.  Vomiting into garbage pail after doing 70 double shots of eggnog.  Pat, you are to comedy.  Jesus, long vomit.  Long vomit.  The vomit threw you off.  Pat, you are to comedy what tsunamis are to little brown children.  James from Hicksville.  He learned Norton would fight back.  Voss would push back. 
[03:59:00]  I love Pat.  Let's go to Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hello, my little peel-de-cuck-a.  Hey, I learned all these bed wood.  I learned some mattress car pile-ups.  Yeah, we did learn that.  All right.  Touch that.  Yeah, please.  You're right there at the end of it, pal.  Thanks for jamming on the gas.  Let's go to Jimmy in New York.  Jimmy.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I learned that shitstick is a new atomic bomb. 
[03:59:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh, very good.  Thank you.  And I also learned that you guys are much easier to reach.  I got through seven fucking times today, and you only put me on once.  Fuck you.  You should have quit while you were ahead, stupid.  You got a good one off, and you got greedy.  Five seconds.  You swerved around one piece of wreckage.  That's right.  Got caught up.  I want to thank Voss for stopping by.  Where are you going to be, Voss?  Pittsburgh Improv.
