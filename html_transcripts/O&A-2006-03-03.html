<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, angrily complaining about their Sirius XM studio's deplorable conditions:  extremely poor lighting and inadequate heating.  Their frustration manifested in copious profanity and insults directed at building management and Sirius XM staff.  A space heater, employed to combat the cold, blew a circuit, plunging the studio into darkness and disabling their clocks. This malfunction sparked a listener conspiracy theory about manipulated broadcast times.  Numerous listener calls followed, with callers offering both support and criticism, engaging in banter and jokes with the hosts.  The conversation shifted to their exclusion from a "Top 100 Talkers" list, triggering a debate about their show's popularity and success.  They also lamented the initial plan to move their show to a premium XM channel, a decision they successfully opposed.  A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on a teacher's sex change and the resulting controversy and listener reactions, with the hosts offering their commentary and reactions to listener calls on the subject.   Further listener complaints arose, this time concerning one host's on-air flatulence.  The hosts also joked about a photoshopped Paltalk image of one of them. The discussion returned to the malfunctioning studio clocks. The show included a humorous parody song submitted by a caller, praised by the hosts, and a song featuring the repeated phrase "put the fucking lotion in the basket" along with graphic descriptions of violence and sexual assault.  The broadcast concluded with a discussion of a fan website and the importance of managing both positive and negative online feedback.  No guests appeared in the studio during the broadcast.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Very nice. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable ass hat.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Chester.  Here, boys. 
[00:04:30]  Come on, Chester.  Chester.  Here, boys.  Come on, Chester.  Chester.  Come on, Chester.  Chester.  Here, boys.  Come, Chester.  Where's Chester?  Chester!  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they were giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  For many days, I didn't bring them here. 
[00:05:00]  Because I suffered when he bites me.  I'm in my vagina.  I'm in my vagina.  The family number times when you insult me.  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  Okay, terrific.  Assholes!  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday! 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Do you want to kiss me?  Who, who, Robin?  Who, who, Robin?  Who, who, who, who, who, Robin?  Robin?  Who, who, who, Robin?  Right, Robin?  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred!  I invented everything!  Put a bandana on your car!  Sirius sucks ass!  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Hello, folks.  Hello, exactly! 
[00:06:00]  Good morning!  Those little opening intros speak volumes.  Sometimes they're just complete nonsense.  Who's in charge?  That's all I'm in.  George W. Bush.  Presently.  But he's only got three years left, if that's what you meant.  The faithful listeners will understand this.  Every morning, we start our radio show in a very, very cold studio. 
[00:06:30]  So you can see it.  I'm wearing my parka.  I feel like it's deja vu all over again.  Yogi stinks.  Ah, Yogi.  Yogi is a...  Yogi stinks.  Learn how to speak.  It's not cute.  Made a career out of it.  And I'm telling Yogi Berra to learn how to speak.  Shows you how bad he is.  So, Anthony's sitting here once again in a massive winter coat.  Yes. 
[00:07:00]  Because the problem is still not solved.  No.  We still have to start the show in a very cold studio.  The countertops are freezing.  So, you know, no one is taking care of this problem for whatever reason.  We have a million, million, like, people between us and the big guy at XM.  Yeah.  But no one can figure it out.  No one can fucking figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  Don Wicklund can't figure it out.  I don't know if it's gotten all the way up to Eric Logan, but no one can figure it out.  Bruce, the guy who runs the New York facility here, he can't figure it out. 
[00:07:30]  All I know is we still start the fucking show every day in a freezing cold studio.  Why?  Because they have AC or something that kicks on in the middle of the night?  It's a building issue.  It's a building-wide issue, Opie.  So, we're like, you know, fuck everybody.  We'll take care of the problem.  So, we started using a space heater.  Mm-hmm.  A fucking space heater.  Yeah, one of those electric-  To warm up the studio so Anthony doesn't have to wear a coat.  Yeah.  I got long johns on and I got, like, two shirts on.  It's chilly.  So, I'm okay.  So, we've been using the space heater because we like to solve our own problems because if 
[00:08:00]  we wait for anybody else, it will take forever.  And now the space heater, what?  Well, E-Rock put it in the wrong plug.  E-Rock, I just say that to look at his face.  He looks at me like, what the fucking-  What?  I put it-  I-  No, I'm teasing, of course, E-Rock.  E-Rock plugged it in and turned it on.  And, of course, space heater uses a lot of power, Opie.  Electrical heat.  Oof.  A lot.  A lot of current running through there.  And we also had the halogen lamps on the same circuit. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, by the way, we had to go out and get lamps from, I don't know, Pottery Barn or something  because we've been bitching about the lights in the studios ever since we started at XM.  It's just not bright enough in here.  Not bright.  They didn't solve that problem either.  Yeah.  So, we had to go out and get stupid lamps.  We got some lamps.  You would think you would just get more powerful light bulbs or different light fixtures.  It looks like it would be an easy fix.  I even said just take down this spaceship that's above our fucking hands.  Take down the bridge of the Enterprise ceiling.  We don't need the spaceship if it means we're not going to have proper lighting in here. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  So, we have these lamps that we got from Pottery Barn to light up the studio, which is another  problem that never was fucking solved.  God, I'm in a pissy mood, obviously.  So, it gets soved.  So, we have this space heater to warm up the studio.  We have the fucking lamps that you would see in your living room because we're trying to  light up the place so we could see each other.  God forbid we see each other when we're broadcasting.  Yeah.  And then what happened today?  Well, the space heater blew the circuit. 
[00:09:30]  Blew one of the circuits.  So, the lights went out and the space heater went out.  And apparently, a lot of people now are thinking it's a conspiracy theory because Jimmy on Pal  Talk, which just went down for scheduled maintenance, so they're not going to be able to see it for  a few minutes.  But people saw the clock and are assuming that we are doing the show earlier or the show is  on a big delay or something because they saw the clock behind Jimmy say 10 to the hour  that we start.  No, we're just getting into the phenomenon that is known as lost. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  You want to just fuck with your minds.  Just lost.  A show that's stupid.  And the power went out, so we have no clocks.  Right.  Those clocks are very important to us.  Well, yeah.  They tell me when it's time to go home.  So, we plugged in the space heater.  It blew a circuit breaker, which took out our lights, took out our clocks.  And we don't even know what else it took out because supposedly on the circuit breaker,  it says something about studio equipment.  Yeah, that's why Mars didn't want to flip it back on. 
[00:10:30]  Now, it only took out the lights and the space heater as far as we know and the clocks as  far as we know.  But he didn't want to flip it off and then flip it back on again because he wasn't sure  if anything else was connected to it.  I'm assuming if anything else is connected to it, it would have blown.  I've dealt with circuit breakers.  Just flip it off, flip it back on.  So, it's 6.51 because we don't have any clocks.  I have no fucking idea what time it is.  It's 6.51.  We're freezing our asses off and we don't have enough lighting in the studio. 
[00:11:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's unbelievable.  It's cold, dark.  It's like the Arctic.  We're in the Arctic.  It's cold and it's dark.  And time means nothing.  Here's sound clips from today's show.  What time is it?  Brr.  Brr.  Let me look at my watch.  10 of 7 still.  Brr.  Steve and Charlotte.  Hey.  Hey.  I can't see anybody.  What's up?  Dark.  About every little thing there is. 
[00:11:30]  What?  You bitch about everything and you do in your life.  Dude.  First of all, Steve, my bitching is way the fuck down.  So, you're not being honest right there.  I think I have the wrong party, sir.  Second of all, when you hear a shitty radio show because we're fucking freezing and Anthony  has to do the whole show with a coat and we can't see shit because there's not proper  lighting in the studio, then you're going to be bitching.  You work four hours a day.  That's right, Steve.  You asshole.  We work four hours a day. 
[00:12:00]  Deal with it.  Steve, you don't want me to start calling it in.  Trust me.  Because then you'll have to find some other shitty radio show to listen to.  And guess what?  You're not going to find it.  There's none out there.  Hey, the show's not talking that.  Yeah, but we want shit to work.  We've been bitching about the lights in the studio.  We've been bitching about coming in here and freezing our asses off.  We're not asking for much.  Steve, Steve, what do you do?  Uh, sales.  Sales.  You never have a problem at work? 
[00:12:30]  No, we always do.  Yeah, and what happens?  Do you voice your, uh, complaints?  Of course he doesn't.  During your on-air or on-air?  No, no, no.  During your working hours?  I guarantee Steve doesn't say shit because he's too scared to get fucking fired from his  10, 50-an-hour job.  Steve, we're brave enough to fucking call people out.  You're not.  You're calling me out, but it's so dishonest, it's not even funny.  I've been bitched in months.  Worker's outside in the cold weather all day, working 10 hours.  I did that, you fuckface.  So did I, asshole. 
[00:13:00]  I never did, and I never will because I'm special.  I had a caddy in the month of October.  It got a little chilly at times.  I one time had to get out of my new caddy and walk into a store without a heated escort.  Steve.  Oh, I do love you boys, though.  Steve, seriously.  We hate you.  The only way we get things done is to bitch on the air because then everyone runs around  and scurries down there in Washington and panics like, oh my god, I might lose my cushy  job.  I better take care of it finally. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, well.  Yeah.  That's what it takes.  Yeah.  And the faithful listeners understand.  We've been bitching about how, I can't tell you, it is freezing in the studio.  Look on PalTalk.  Anthony's got a huge winter coat on.  Can't.  PalTalk is down.  Oh, damn it.  You know, that's no way to do a radio show.  You can't sit around in a big winter coat trying to be funny.  Wanting a jacket is, I've been wanting a clock is fairly reasonable when you have to kind  of be on a schedule with a show.  To say I'd like a clock to look at is not really a big demand. 
[00:14:00]  Did Iraq come in here with a clock?  Yeah.  Is that a digital clock?  Yeah, we need some kind of clock.  Nice.  Nice.  Sweet boy.  That's wonderful.  Thanks, Steve.  Now he's going to listen to himself.  Jeff and Flora.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up?  Hi.  Just calling to bust your balls and see how your manginas are doing this morning because  you're doing a lot of bitching.  They're a little tender.  They're chillier than they should be.  They're cold and I can't see it.  Usually females have their periods the middle of the month, not the first of the month. 
[00:14:30]  Yes.  And why doesn't anyone understand what we're going through?  Because they don't.  Sir, I know we have an easy job and all that.  I never said we didn't.  We do work a lot harder than four hours.  I wasn't even going to try to argue that point with that guy.  But, I mean, we just want basic shit.  We don't want to freeze our asses off when we're trying to be funny and entertaining.  Don't you understand?  It's for you, the listener.  It's for you that we are complaining because we want to be able to have conditions here 
[00:15:00]  at the studio where we can put on the best show ever.  Ever.  The show is awesome.  I've been an XM listener for about a year and a half now, and you guys are all I listen  to in the morning.  Jeff, you have a toilet, sir?  You have a mother?  Jeff.  Yep.  We know the show is awesome.  The people around us are not awesome, and that's what I'm saying right now.  Oh, look who's around you right now.  Stan.  Stan is awesome.  He's fantastic.  I'll go a little further.  The staff here in New York, love them.  They're awesome, too.  I'm not talking about them.  Not all of them.  Maybe a couple of them. 
[00:15:30]  I'm talking about people that can't get fucking problem solved.  They know who they are.  Well, I can relate.  In my line of work, you've got to do some bitch and get the bosses to get off their  ass to do their job, so I can relate.  Sure, it impresses them when you stutter like that.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's up?  Morning, my frigid little friends.  Hello there, our Boston.  Wait, this is normal.  E-Rock has...  Oh, no.  It's a hotel alarm clock.  He's got an alarm clock that you would see in any hotel so I can see the time, because 
[00:16:00]  we do have to take breaks and stuff.  And now he's got, like, how many extension cords?  Because you don't want to plug it in the studio, because who knows what will blow next.  Blow something up.  So how many extension cords?  One industrial extension cord.  Right.  And then to the other side of the office.  This is plugged into the office?  No, on the other side of the radio station.  Oh, one of the cubicles?  Oh, my God.  There's no second hand.  This is normal.  I told you what you should do is to stand next to open, just make the ticking noise every 
[00:16:30]  second.  Oh, could you do that and rotate your arm around your body?  Tick, tick.  Yeah.  That's right.  Just like that.  It's hawk o'clock.  That means everybody eat mayo and shit your pants.  You know, 20 to hawk.  You know what?  And we understand things happen, okay?  I'm talking about problems that we've talked about for a really long time.  And when we got these lamps, I said, this is a quick fix, but I'm still not happy with  the lighting in here.  I remember saying that.  I know.  We got those lamps six, who knows how many months ago. 
[00:17:00]  At least six months ago, I would say.  Doesn't show off our tans.  Guys, I called to solve your problem.  Hey, Chris.  Thank you, sir.  Why can't you just put a pair of Steve's shoes in the middle of the room?  What a callback.  If Steve had his flaming shoes, we could just put one on one side of the console, one on  the other, and huddle around them and warm our hands.  I feel your pain.  I'm just trying to help you out.  Hey, E-Rock, can you do me a favor and go get my winter coat?  It's time to broadcast.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm freezing.  I like mittens. 
[00:17:30]  I got gloves if you need them.  Nah.  Actually, guys, body heat.  Everybody just strip down and huddle up.  There you go.  So you're preaching to the choir.  Punch it out, man.  We do that on hot days.  Sure do.  I will say it again.  We need better lighting in the studio, better than the lamps that we bought months and months  ago, and we need to have a warm studio.  Right.  So we will be saying it for the 10th time.  Oh, thank you.  This is normal. 
[00:18:00]  Putting on his heavy coat.  There he goes.  E-Rock, Paltock, back up.  Get on your cam.  Very important to people that they can see Jimmy Norton.  I've heard that seeing me on cam is all the rage.  It is.  It certainly is.  And so is XOXO and the show she put on this morning.  Yeah.  For everybody in the office. 
[00:18:30]  Wonderful.  Let's say hi to Tom in Cleveland.  Tom, what's up?  Opie, you're a clock diva.  Maybe you can take that extension cord and Jimmy can plug his drill in.  But, you know, crazy me, I say we just like, you know, fix the circuit breaker and see  what happens.  And you probably both have cell phones.  You both have BlackBerrys.  You have computers in front of you.  Don't they all have clocks on them?  You need a second hand, sir.  You have to have a second hand.  No, they did say just use the computer to your right. 
[00:19:00]  No, I need a clock right in front of me.  All right.  It sounds really stupid, and I'm not going to try to explain it.  It's just a lot easier that way, to have something right in front of you, a big digital  clock.  It's almost like having, like, Eric in front of me.  It's not the same if I can't look over and see him.  I'd say we do the show with no clock and just try to figure out when four hours is over.  And then we just leave?  Yeah.  We just leave, and then someone goes, uh, guys, it's 810.  You did an hour of radio.  No, we're such dopes.  We probably stayed here at, like, 1240.  Right.  What time is it?  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, panicking.  You think we made it to four hours?  Panicking Pete?  It's three in the afternoon.  Oh, God.  Jason in Louisiana.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, first time caller, long time listener.  Thanks, Chase.  Yeah.  Say one of Jimmy's lines and say that you guys are phenomenal.  Okay.  Phenomenal.  Yeah, I can already see the new Steve C. promo coming.  Hater Davis.  Hater Davis.  Absolutely.  Can you say that again? 
[00:20:00]  Hater Davis.  Hater Davis.  Hater Davis.  Hater Davis.  I liked you on American Idol last night.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Congratulations.  You made it throw.  All right.  Look, guys, just wanted to tell y'all, I got a game that I played just past the time  as an over-the-road driver.  Yes.  The golf course is the stuff that we pass in the countries and all that.  I have a set of train horns on my truck.  Train horns.  So, take that as an over-the-road driver.  Are you in your truck right now? 
[00:20:30]  All right, Mike, for one.  Oh, no.  We're losing you, buddy.  We got a lot.  All I wanted to hear is train horn.  I know.  Andrew in Virginia Beach.  Heat and lighting are for top 100 talkers.  Ah, he might have a valid point there, Opie.  People that made the top one.  You know who I bet has heat and lights?  Rusty Humphreys.  Rusty Humphreys.  You have to see the paper when you're jotting down that song, Parody.  Is in a well-lit, warm studio, as we speak, broadcasting. 
[00:21:00]  In a suit jacket.  Comfortable.  Him and Neil Bortz.  Neil.  Neil Bortz is warm like it's in the Caribbean, and it's lit up, and he knows what time it  is, both literally and figuratively.  I read Neil Bortz's contract, and he said it's got to be as warm as the inside of an  elephant's colon for him to do a successful radio show.  Exactly.  By the way, I guess today's the day that Michael Harrison will come on the program.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, is he going to actually come on now? 
[00:21:30]  To explain why we weren't in the top 100 talkers in America.  To explain the criteria for that top 100 and how we did not fit in.  It just doesn't make sense.  I guess we've got to explain once again.  There were people that were in the top 100 talkers list.  Rusty Humphreys.  That are like one market sensations to begin with.  Yeah.  One lady just does tech talk, and she beat us out.  Yeah, she does like a 10-minute little show or something.  And Bob Edwards, who's on Satellite, the Satellite Sisters. 
[00:22:00]  I mean, I'm saying there's people that are satellite acts.  Bob Edwards, who's, yeah, he does one hour a day.  Our own company admits that we're bigger than Bob Edwards.  So, I don't know.  So, we're going to talk to him today.  Hey, good.  Get to the bottom of that.  Good.  We'll see how honest he is.  Right.  What is he going to say?  We didn't fit the criteria.  Yeah.  Well, guys.  What part didn't we fit?  There's a whole list.  They actually spelt it out.  And I thought we fit everything on there, but apparently we didn't.  All right.  We have the lists. 
[00:22:30]  Maybe they can bring us the lists again so we can talk to this gentleman.  Yeah, before he calls.  Thanks, Dan.  Who wants to hear Howie Lyon?  Might as well get all the bitching out of the way now.  Isn't that just his show at this point?  It certainly is, but when he's lying about us, we've got to set the record straight.  Yeah.  Here's the list.  Don't worry.  It's a quickie.  Yeah.  For all you people that are like, why do you got to talk about it every day?  Well, when it comes up on his show, what are we supposed to do? 
[00:23:00]  Sit back and make believe it didn't happen?  No, we address it.  All right.  Here we go again.  We got to explain something again.  Again.  Maybe we're not broadcasting anywhere.  So much explanation.  Maybe that's why nothing's getting fixed around here is because we're not broadcasting.  These things aren't on.  Hello?  The fans that call it are all actually employees in Washington fucking with us.  Right.  Right.  Don't tell them.  Don't tell them.  They haven't been on in a year.  Yeah.  We just don't want to piss them off.  I bet you that's what it is. 
[00:23:30]  Maybe we're just not broadcasting.  I've actually been fucking the same fan over and over, but she just wears different sunglasses  and loses or actually puts on 50 pounds every time.  All right.  Well, we got to explain something again after this clip.  Here we go.  Howie Lyon once again.  One last question.  Do you think later down the road, serious subscribers are going to have to be paying for just your  channel alone?  No.  No.  I don't think so at all.  I think that we're part of the service.  They might get rid of everything else, but they would never charge you more. 
[00:24:00]  You'll have to pay more for everything else, but not us.  No, no, no.  In fact, in fact, you know.  On XM, if you want certain stations, you have to pay extra for them, like a dollar extra  a month.  Well, they tried that with Opie and Anthony.  The problem was that Opie was willing to pay for them.  They're a complete bust.  Yeah.  We're a complete bust.  Yeah, we're a complete bust.  We're a complete bust.  He's going to explain the premium channel thing that happened in the beginning of our  fine run here on satellite radio. 
[00:24:30]  I'll have to go back a little bit here.  You have to pay extra for them, like a dollar extra a month.  Well, they tried that with Opie and Anthony.  The problem was no one was willing to pay for them.  They're a complete bust.  Nothing happened over there as a result of them.  No one, you know, it's a big difference about whether your fans are loyal enough to go pay  for you.  So what they did when they hired them is they hired them for nothing because they couldn't  get work anywhere.  Right.  All right, man.  Thanks.  And they take care.  They hired them for nothing.  And then they said, well, I'll tell you what, we'll charge a dollar extra for you guys. 
[00:25:00]  And you guys can participate in that if you can get people to pay a dollar and they couldn't  get anyone to pay.  Not one person.  And now they've unleashed.  Not one person we couldn't get to pay, Opie.  Remember?  Remember me and you actually buying thousands of subscriptions all by ourselves just to  make it look good?  Look, man, when we signed with XM Satellite Radio, they had a business plan that they thought  was going to work.  Yeah.  They really thought that, you know, they could get another revenue stream going. 
[00:25:30]  Howard, you know about revenue streams, right?  It's called tiers.  You know how cable television has basic cable and then there's a tiered system where you  can get premium programming like HBO, Showtime, kind of an a la carte kind of a thing like  that?  That was this business plan that they had for a little while.  And we were to be part of that tiered plan.  We were not happy with it.  We didn't want to do it right from the start.  We thought it was a very stupid idea. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  We wanted to be on.  And a bigger reason we were on is because they were scared shitless of this program.  We had screwed up.  We had targets on our backs at that time.  And they were a little scared about letting the general population of their platform be  able to just tune into the show.  They wanted to have it subscriber based.  We were really bummed, but they wanted to go into this very safe.  Yeah.  Very safe. 
[00:26:30]  And we were told from day one, let's see how it goes.  And they were talking about any kind of backlash, any kind of problems with the show.  And then we'll discuss getting you off of a premium channel.  Not how many subscriptions come in because they were very happy with the amount of subscriptions  that came in.  So were we.  I was very surprised after two years of not being on the air.  We had a hell of a lot of subscribers coming and coming on board, but we didn't want to 
[00:27:00]  be that way.  We wanted to be part of the entire XM platform.  And when they realized we weren't going around biting the throats out of babies on our show,  they put us on the platform.  And that, my friends, is the God's honest truth.  Yeah.  And the business plan just wasn't going to work.  No.  And they want to expose us to the entire XM nation.  They knew that we were going to be good boys, relatively speaking, in the satellite radio  world.  And they're like, this is very smart to expose them to everybody.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  That's exactly what happened, Howard.  And you know that.  I heard the argument both ways from people that don't like us very much that we were  on the premium.  And it's like, oh, they got to put them on premium because no one listens to these guys.  So they want to make as much money as they can.  And then when we got off the premium, the same people were like, oh, I had to take them  off because no one was subscribing.  What's the difference?  What's the difference if no one's listening to us and five people subscribe?  Wouldn't you rather pocket the five people's money and keep pocketing it? 
[00:28:00]  And Howard, if we were a complete bust, why didn't they fire us yet?  Yeah.  Because you even said in that rant that they got us cheap.  And we've done nothing.  Right.  So why didn't they fire us if we're such a bust, you asshole?  Yeah.  You think they're just good guys allowing us to broadcast a show even though we stink?  Yeah, we stink, Howard.  We stink.  And they didn't get us cheap, Howard.  Well, relative to what he makes, everyone is hired cheap. 
[00:28:30]  Relative to the Howie paycheck, yeah.  They got us real cheap.  Yeah, they got me so cheap that I just looked at a multi-million dollar apartment in your  fucking building, asshole.  Ix ne on ye i de a ye artman pay.  We're going to have fun in the elevator together.  Fun in the elevator.  Opie and Howie going down.  Fun in the elevator.  It's a terrific place.  I just don't know if I want it yet.  That's all.  So stop lying and saying that the XM got us really cheap. 
[00:29:00]  Can I borrow a cup of sugar?  Hoo-hoo.  Do they do that anymore?  They didn't get us cheap.  Smack someone in the face when they came to my door.  We're beyond successful here at XM.  Jimmy's like, they didn't?  What?  That's just wee shit.  You know, I wish that Eric Logan and the gang down there would release some numbers to  the press.  Yes.  Because the phone calls we get behind the scenes, but they're like, ah, you can't say  anything though.  But, oh my God.  I wish Eric would release his barber.  Oh my God.  The latest survey's out and blah, blah, blah is happening. 
[00:29:30]  Blah, blah, blah is happening.  But this is like, why is it confidential information?  Why don't they release numbers?  Secret.  Because then we could shut all these idiots up.  Secrets.  The, um, I believe it has something to do with the stock.  Anything that's mentioned about numbers and subs by anybody that seems to be in the know  and we would fall into that category affects the stock.  And we are not in the position where we can discuss that.  Thank you very much.  Howard Stern, we're your worst nightmare and it's only going to get worse for you. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, it's really only going to get worse.  And we, uh, we, uh, we have more listeners than you.  If you're, if you're goofing on how many listeners we have and how much of a bust it is,  how do we got more listeners than you?  Every day.  More people hear this show than hear your show.  What, what's that about?  What's that about?  And Opie and Anthony always win in the end.  Right.  Trust me on that.  Even when it looks like we're getting it in the end.  Then the Babylon Hall.  Come out victorious. 
[00:30:30]  The Babylon Hall had this to say on the show yesterday.  Mission.  And now they've unleashed the army, so.  Yeah, the army of four people.  Very impressive.  But listen, you know what?  I get it.  Two chairs.  That's my point of view.  I mean, honestly.  But there's the army.  Here they come.  Whoop-de-do.  Whoop-de-do.  Why'd you have your press conference, uh, off your show, Howard?  Why'd you have your press conference? 
[00:31:00]  Why'd you call it, uh, in a place?  You used to have it on your show.  You can do press conferences and invite the press into your studio and do it that way.  You knew nobody was listening.  You know how many listeners you have.  It's not that many, is it?  And if we were a bus, why would we be discussing a contract extension right now with XM?  We are.  We are?  Yes, we are.  Yes, we are.  How is that happening?  Don't tell the truth here, Howard, you fucking asshole.  We tell most of the truth. 
[00:31:30]  Opie, shut up.  Well, they're happy and they just want to, you know, continue the relationship.  That's all I'm saying.  Who wouldn't?  That's all I'm saying.  Who wouldn't?  Don't panic on me, Anthony.  You guys have a contract?  Panic to Pete.  Yes, we have a contract, Jimmy.  You will too soon.  You'll get one soon, one day.  One day we can all sit and talk about our contracts together.  And as far as the ONA Army, yeah, keep laughing, Howard. 
[00:32:00]  Keep laughing.  Laugh your goddamn heads off.  Keep laughing.  It's more than four people.  You know that.  You knew it to the point that you raced your freaking limo.  You didn't even want to deal with the four or five guys that showed up at work on their own, by the way.  We didn't have an all-out assault.  Some of the pests took it upon themselves.  The video is online.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  They took it upon themselves to just wait for Howard outside the little doggy company. 
[00:32:30]  He arrives in a limo with all sorts of security guards waiting.  They probably have walkie-talkies.  Howard's making the turn.  Here it comes.  And then they open up this huge garage door, and Howard pretty much runs homeless people over to get into the garage as fast as possible.  Then they shut the doors.  The NORAD vault door shuts.  But you'll see it on the video.  Before they shut the doors, I guess he goes around a corner.  And our own Ben Sparks, he used to work there.  He goes, oh, my God.  You know what they're doing with that limo?  I go, what, Ben?  That limo is going into a freight elevator. 
[00:33:00]  The entire car.  The entire car goes into a freight elevator.  And then it's taking up how many floors?  I forgot.  50 floors?  I don't know.  We were there a bunch of times and trying to remember.  Way up.  Let's call it, like, 50 floors.  Sure.  They take the limo 50 floors up, and then Howard gets out.  Can the driver one day just leave the limo running in the elevator, please, and roll the windows down?  Ben only knows, because that's how he used to get his cock up to the top of the building. 
[00:33:30]  That was the only way.  This is the same guy laughing about our army and the five people that showed up.  Hoo-hoo.  You know, if you weren't scared of them, why don't you roll down the window and have a little fun with the pass?  You pussy.  Yeah, have some fun with them.  They'd enjoy it.  But Ben swears that that limo goes into a freight elevator, and then it's taken to the 50th floor, and then he steps out in complete protection.  A little paranoid, Howard? 
[00:34:00]  A little paranoid?  Just a bit.  We got a lot in store for you, too.  Trust me on that.  Yeah, have fun.  Have fun.  We'll just bide our time.  And then this dump thing happened.  Someone was saying that he doesn't want to take the car into the elevator, but it is the only way to get the Sirius unit that's in the vehicle up that.  Ben, is that actually correct?  It's the 36th floor.  All right, 36th floor.  Howard takes a freight elevator that gets out on his wing, where Jeremy's office used to be and all those guys' office. 
[00:34:30]  That's great.  He doesn't even interact with anyone Sirius, and it's all closed off.  This guy's such a great guy, he doesn't even say hi to anybody else at Sirius.  Dream come true to work with that.  Yeah, he's got walls set up and everything where no one is going to run into him.  His personal office is bigger than Mel's.  Really?  Yeah, it's huge.  Must be nice.  Well, he's got the bigger ego.  Sex change teacher controversy on the news.  Yeah.  Perhaps we have this on tape. 
[00:35:00]  I just saw a picture of it talking, and that is hysterical enough right there, the audio.  Oh, look, look.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  It is William Frawley.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Look at the little.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to do the Mrs. Brady hair.  Is that an SNL character?  Come on.  Is there any way to pop up a little audio?  I don't know.  Let's see.  Some late change of life thing that you decided to do. 
[00:35:30]  This is a her.  It's a process your mind goes through, and you finally come to the conclusion, if I'm going  to be free and happy, there's something I have to do about my situation.  And thank heavens today for medical science that can help people like that.  Thank heavens?  Not every transsexual goes through the operation, so to speak.  In fact, they live as women for many years without that.  When does he get in the operation?  But there are various choices you can make when you come to that conclusion.  He's had it already? 
[00:36:00]  I don't know how we should do the operation for him.  Leave the Secretary of Defense alone.  A headectomy.  I heard the parents in the piece.  I listened.  And the fact that they're elementary school age, roughly five years old, 12 years old.  Are you disguising yourself because you shot your friend in the face?  Oh, my gosh.  I was right behind you on that one.  Damn it.  I understand it all.  They're concerned because many of these young people, kids, saw you as a man.  Yeah.  And now they're going to see you as a man with a wig.  They still see you as a man.  They see you as a man with a wig and mommy's earrings.  I understand the parents' fear, and they're trying to project that fear onto each other. 
[00:36:30]  If you change it to a woman, wouldn't you dress that fear?  Because the children don't have that fear.  Lily!  Okay?  They learn that from adults.  And if we teach children in college, that's what they're going to do.  He's got what is known as Crazy Eddie clothes on.  Remember the guy that used to do the Crazy Eddie commercial?  It's a blazer and a turtleneck.  If your teacher changes his or her hairstyle or color, are you prepared in what you're going to say?  Oh, hair color.  If indeed a young child says to you, what did you do? 
[00:37:00]  You don't discuss those things with a child.  You just leave them going home confused.  Absolutely.  No matter what it is, if somebody came into you in a classroom and asked a question,  nothing to do with anything of your personal life, you put that aside until some appropriate time.  Oh, stop.  Remember when a teacher used to come in and say they were getting married?  Yeah, but I'm not there to teach anything about a gender shift.  Well, you'd hear a teacher had their cock lopped off.  Right.  You had to ask.  Remember when Chubsy-Ubsy kissed Mrs. Crabtree? 
[00:37:30]  I could dismiss that with you another time out of the classroom.  Personal things happen all the time.  You put it off and pretty soon they forget it.  They go back to doing what they're doing.  No, they don't forget it.  They've got to look at you every day.  This is a woman now?  But you don't lie to them either.  That's what he says.  How about with your own children?  They're adults now.  Oh, his children.  Hold on.  They're adults and they're free to make any decision.  They're not happy.  Have they been accepting?  No.  It's been difficult?  At times.  It's difficult.  At times.  You have to remember they're going through the same process everybody else has to. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, dad's a faggot.  Right.  And I respect their right to believe what they want to do.  Oh, you could tell.  So now you wait for the call.  You're a substitute.  So what that means is you're on a list.  Right.  And then you wait for the call.  They're actually spending more time with his cock.  6.37 in the morning.  You think this guy's expected a Mother's Day card?  I wouldn't.  Do you realize they have friends that used to come over at high school that wrecked them?  That's fucking so-and-so's mother.  Yeah.  They have the protocol they follow.  And I live by that.  I've lived by it for years.  Oh, my. 
[00:38:30]  I'm curious because all the attention that Felicity Huffman is getting as the Best Actress  nominee for Transamerica and the attention this movie is getting, does that help with awareness?  I think the movie gives a very fair presentation of the agony that people like me go through.  He has nothing to do with being a woman.  He's not a woman.  It is a guy that decided to remove his genitals and try to have them fashioned into some sort of vagina. 
[00:39:00]  He's got an ass, and he looks like a man wearing a Mrs. Brady wig.  He looks ridiculous.  He's wearing makeup, a little rouge, a little lipstick, and a little eye shadow.  And he's plucked his eyebrows.  But I swear he does.  He looks like Rumsfeld or Cheney in a wig.  He'd look more feminine if he actually had on one of those plastic Princess Leia masks.  And by the way, Dad, if you're listening, don't even think about it. 
[00:39:30]  I won't accept it.  Who would?  Who would?  Poor adult kids.  That's supposed to be your dad.  You've got to hug him.  Poor adult kids.  You've got to hug him.  Thank you for coming and sharing that with us.  You have a big back pat.  Thanks for inviting me.  I wish you all the best.  Wish you all the best.  Time now for the weather.  Thank you.  How's your dad?  Time now for the weather.  And the weatherman's standing there with the butthead look on his face.  Just not even moving, just as...  It's cloudy with a chance of castration. 
[00:40:00]  Whoops.  What the hell was that?  We've got to get an expert on to explain that because I don't get it on any level.  No.  Why you would make yourself look like an ugly old woman.  You know, you want to dress up like a broad.  With a man's voice.  It's his prerogative.  If even private or whatever, he wants to dress up like a broad.  I saw a show on HBO.  These guys decide to dress up like broads and then they go hook up with each other and  have a whole day as women.  They go out shopping. 
[00:40:30]  They go out to a little nightclub.  And these guys are just men in women's clothing.  That's it.  Are they gay or no?  Are they like Ed Wood?  No.  Some of them are like, yeah, Ed Wood.  I like to wear women's clothing.  I love it.  And they're guys.  And that's what this guy is.  But he went the distance.  And now he's disowned by his kids.  Well, you have to know that the whole time you're bringing your buddies over, all your  jock friends.  Now you're looking back over those years going, God, Dad wanted all their cocks.  How creepy is that? 
[00:41:00]  Picture your father rubbing one out to your buddies.  Oh, stop.  Mike in Kentucky.  He's thinking of Chet in his abs.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, I just wanted to know if this guy stands up in front of the class and tucks his cock  between his legs and says, I'd fuck me.  I'd fuck me.  Would you?  Would you?  It puts the homework in the basket.  Who wants to come up to the board and solve this problem?  Oh, James? 
[00:41:30]  Would you?  Thank you.  Well, this would be a perfect time to play the song that came in overnight.  Oh, my God.  John S. in Hartford, Connecticut.  You nailed it.  I got the answers to your quiz right here somewhere.  Let me look for him.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Is he a great big fat person?  Greatest question ever asked under any circumstances.  Let me wait till you hear this.  This had us all laughing really hard in the office today.  It's John S. in Hartford, Connecticut.  He's got Jame Gum doing Down in a Hole. 
[00:42:00]  Well, we were commenting on how some of the music from the 90s, the grunge music, the alt music, kind of the vocalists, a lot of them sounded like Jame Gum.  And this guy took it to the next level and did an Alice in Chains song as Jame Gum.  Down in a Hole.  John S. in Hartford.  Bravo, sir.  Nice guitar work.  Can you help me put this in my van? 
[00:42:30]  Would you?  With my broken arm, I don't think I can.  I have been guilty of murdering girls that are fat You're on my list now, what do you think about that You're down in a hole, yeah And I'm in control 
[00:43:00]  You're down in a hole, cause I hate my paw, I like to tuck, I like to tuck in my junk 
[00:43:30]  Frederica, great big fat person  You're down in a hole, and it's all because you aren't thin Now you're forced to put the lotion on your skin  We just a man, it was that just a knock at the door I smell a cunt, it must be that old FBI whore 
[00:44:00]  You're down in a hole, yeah And I'm in control, you're down in a hole, cause I hate my paw, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I hate my paw, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in my pocket, I like to tuck in 
[00:44:30]  I like to talk in my junk.  How good is that?  John S. in Hartford, very nice.  Good job.  Very good job.  Nice, simple. 
[00:45:00]  And it works.  He got the job done.  Didn't even ask for it.  No, let's say hi to Paul in Boston.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Paul.  Yeah, I just want to know if that shim teacher was a cougar or not.  Yeah, he's a new cougar.  Punch him out.  Out on the prowl.  If you're 71, and he's like 71, just fucking stop it.  Just die with dignity and think of your family, you selfish ass.  Right, selfish ass.  If he was in his 40s even, it's bad enough, but you might have 25 years ahead of you, so. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  71, tough it out.  Think of your sons.  Right at the end, he's got to have his children disown him.  Yeah, and they got to look at you in the coffin in that stupid blonde wig.  All the years you tossed a football, now all of a sudden you're laying there in that awful  22-year-old lady wig.  At least get gray hair and a bun, Helen.  A bun.  Get a bun.  Don't you think if you're a parent you got a little more responsibility? 
[00:46:00]  Like you were saying, I mean, he's a bit selfish.  Just a tad.  His entire film, he's like, oh my god.  You're not supporting this.  How are your children handling it?  Yeah, that shook him up a bit.  They haven't set me on fire.  Like, you know.  This is how his children are handling it.  Fast forward to Christmas.  All right.  He's in his living room waiting for the phone to ring.  Hello.  Where are they? 
[00:46:30]  Where?  They're right now at the store trying to find the Hallmark series.  Merry Christmas, faggot.  Thanks for nothing, comma dad.  You think he's going to have the one understanding kid that will buy the Mother's Day card, though?  Like, ugh.  I can't believe I got to do this.  That guy has just created so much baggage that other people are now going to have to deal with.  Absolutely.  In relationships and stuff.  Yeah, which it do affects so many more people. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, it's a blast radius.  It's a trickle down thing.  Right.  Grandchildren.  Grandchildren.  Grandchildren and, ugh.  Got to look at that disaster coming over.  Grandma.  I think you do that when you're young and single.  You can make a few bucks.  Right.  There you go, Jimmy.  Let's go to Rachel in Texas.  Rachel.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  That was the funniest shit I've ever heard in my life.  Rachel.  You've called back.  What was, Rach? 
[00:47:30]  The song.  Did you enjoy it?  Yes.  I like that song.  I think it was a great song.  Please put that on ONA.com.  I will do that.  I'll hand it over right now.  Thank you.  Have Steve throw that up on ONA.com so people can download that.  Rachel.  All right, Rachel.  Could you say something nice about me, too?  Well, I was going to ask Jimmy, when are you coming to El Paso?  Please.  El Paso City.  El Paso.  By the Rio Grande.  Doing a little Slim Whitman.  Ooh.  Thank you.  I will be there, but not until, um, it all depends. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  Please.  My husband and I bought XM just solely so we could listen to ONA, and we want Jimmy to  come to El Paso.  Thank you.  Maybe someday.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  It's like we're all going to sit down.  All right.  Look, guys.  Yeah.  We know we got some stuff coming up.  When is Jim getting to El Paso?  El Paso.  How's about this?  Never.  Problem figured out.  That's the best way to answer one of those weird questions.  We'll figure it out.  We'll figure it out.  We're all going to get together.  We got Elo coming in. 
[00:48:30]  Hugh Pinero has been under the weather, but he's going to fly in.  We're going to figure it out.  We're going to figure it out.  When I'm getting to El Paso.  We just don't know yet.  The whole company.  Don't worry, though.  We'll figure it out.  It's a very complicated issue.  I don't know how many times I've heard that, and nothing happens.  Don't worry.  We'll figure it out.  Will ya?  That's why it's called that.  You El Paso it and go right to LA.  I knew it was going to bomb.  I just took a trip to El Bommel.  Oh, it's linked up on Foundry Music already?  That Alice in Chains song you just heard from John S. in Hartford. 
[00:49:00]  Yes.  It will be linked on opianthony.com as well.  Fucking Steve.  El Prompto.  No, Steve's been terrific.  Good boy.  He's El Assolo.  He's unbelievable.  Mark in Massachusetts.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Mark.  Hey, well, you know, today's the first day I've turned XM on, and I've had it on for five minutes.  First song I heard was Down in the Hole.  I've got to get that song.  Paul, look, you're a five-minute listener?  Just turned on to you guys today.  All right.  We have to recap.  All right. 
[00:49:30]  I met Anthony about the first day.  11, 12 years, 11 and a half years ago, I was doing this show.  BAB, and then I had a band, the song, Parody Opie.  We played it on the air.  Me and Opie talked.  Invited me in.  Most of the kids under a porch.  Came from Boston.  Me and Opie went to Boston, fired.  The mayor was dead.  Got hired in New York.  Good run there.  Three, four years.  The reason why I kicked Chester was because, you know, I had the prime rib.  He had prime rib.  I watched the Knicks in the playoffs, and I was very happy. 
[00:50:00]  And I discovered girls.  I was there for a glass of water, and I went back down, and there was my prime rib dinner  on the rug.  Lousy drunk, took all my money.  And the dog was eating the prime rib, so I had decided to kick it across the room.  I was very pissed off that day.  Hey, this is Jimmy Norton.  I want to introduce you.  And then St. Pat's Cathedral, boof, out the door, two years, hanging out.  I heard about that.  Oh, well, then we don't have to fill you in on that.  Oh, you heard about the Sex for Sam thing.  All right.  What did we do when we first got to XM? 
[00:50:30]  What was our first bit?  Remember.  Fix this, fix this, fix this.  That's broken, fix this.  That's broken, fix this.  That's true.  Okay.  Let's do that for three months.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, well, welcome to the program, Mark.  You're all caught up.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Really appreciate it.  Great time.  All right, Johnny.  I'm looking forward to some fun times.  Yeah, thanks.  Jake in Jersey.  Way to talk like an adult, stupid.  Fun times.  What's up, Jake?  Oh, tell me that this fucking freak show doesn't look like Bruce Valanche from Celebrity  Pit Club. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  You nailed it.  All right.  You nailed it.  Hey, look.  Punch it out.  You nailed it.  That'll be on Photoshop.  The Photoshop, by the way, we haven't talked about the Photoshops in a while.  Whackbag in the Photoshop section.  Bravo, man.  They continue to do just great work with that.  Who did the Robert Reed one that you showed me?  Oh, well, that was me.  Was that you?  I've gotten all caught up in that.  There's plenty of great software out there now where it's not just Photoshop.  People are taking a lot of video.  There are some real talented people out there. 
[00:51:30]  I don't want to forget anybody.  Mike Pop is very good.  Cigars and Scotch.  Very good.  There's another one, too.  I can't remember.  I haven't seen it in a while.  Was it Ben's Hog?  No.  I don't remember his name.  Norton's Hog.  Yeah, Norton's Hog.  Very, very good.  He kind of does the same work as Ben's Hog, but he's much smaller.  There's a video, because now any video clips from us on PalTalk cameras, from news things,  they take like Howie, they do hysterical shit with the Howie videos, and pop it up there. 
[00:52:00]  It's very funny.  I've never seen such a talented bunch of people on a message board Photoshop thread.  What was the one they did?  I think the three of us, they put it in a video.  A minute after we talked about something, it was up like three Cowboys.  It was us curling.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Oh, the curling video was hilarious.  It was us curling.  They took a video of curling and had us curling.  It's the Photoshop section on whackbag.com. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  They do a very, very good job over there.  Very funny.  And the bitching's way down, and we greatly appreciate that.  Because we think a fan site should be more happy posts than negative posts.  I liked when Kevin Smith was here and talked about his website.  Call me crazy for saying that, but I think a fan site should be more positive than negative.  Yeah.  Or we can't promote it as a fan site.  I liked when Kevin Smith came in and talked about it and said, no, it should be a kiss-ass site.  He goes, that's why he's in charge of that site.  Whackbag isn't our site, but we do promote it, 
[00:53:00]  and we'll only promote sites that are positive to the show.  Why on earth are we going to go and promote sites that bash the shit out of us and the show?  Why would we do that?  It's ridiculous.  And then they whine sometimes, you know, you only promote Whackbag because they, you know, kiss your ass.  They're not kissing our ass.  They get negative at times, but all we're asking for is a fan site that's way more positive than negative.  Right.  There's a fan site we used to promote all the time.  I swear to you, I haven't checked it out in eight to nine months.  Nope.  I just gave up on him. 
[00:53:30]  Let him sit there.  Absolutely gave up on him.  And have fun with each other.  You want to have, you want, there's negative posts you got to have sometimes, but you just want to balance it.  If I see myself getting bashed in a thread, and I know it's hard to imagine, but it's happened.  No.  No.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I kid you not.  I know.  Hypothetically, let's say it didn't happen.  If it would have happened.  Okay.  You got to look at the responses, and when like eight out of the ten responses, whether  it's about the show or anything, from like the regulars are all kind of negative.  You're like, oh, well, that's kind of like a negative vibe. 
[00:54:00]  There's no balance.  I can believe it.  There's been times where whack bag has really fucking annoyed me.  Yeah.  But you'll find a bit of a balance there.  And it's a few people.  You know, the majority are pretty cool.  There's only one guy that doesn't like me, and he posts under many different names.  Yes.  Maybe 30 or 40.  Well, that's why I encourage these fan sites, if they are fan sites, to eat their own.  There you go.  Because it does come down to a few that completely wreck the balance of a message board or a fan  site.  And that's the job of the actual website, to eat your own.  I get on there, though, and I talk a little smack if they're bitching about the show or 
[00:54:30]  something like that.  I try to balance it out.  And if they don't, you know, can't turn them around, fuck it.  I'm not going to get all pissed off about it.  Do you believe there are people that didn't enjoy me farting into the mic?  No.  No.  Shut up.  Do you believe I would sit there and I would write and create that bit where I would stand  up and put my ass, how far do you stand from the microphone?  What do you eat to make it loud?  No one appreciates it.  Logistics.  Exactly.  By the way, your ass on Pal Talk yesterday is all over the place. 
[00:55:00]  It's hilarious.  It's all the people who have been photoshopping that.  One gentleman just quickly put a gay man fully aroused right behind you.  Of course they did.  It was a simple, short, and sweet one.  All right.  Why don't we go to break with put the fucking lotion in the basket?  Oh.  Break?  I thought it was time to leave.  Well, it's 2.46.  It's not open.  Or it's 8.47.  They try to fix the clocks because I saw them going backwards. 
[00:55:30]  I didn't even notice that the power was turned on.  Yeah.  The lamps are back on.  But I saw them working on the clocks, and I saw them going backwards.  And at this point, I guess it's 2.47, and that clock says 8.47 now as well.  What's the one that's like 3 o'clock?  I'm scared.  It's almost 3.  I said 2.47.  Oh.  Oh, I would have called that like, I don't know, 13 to 3.  Oh.  No, I go digital.  You're old school.  Yeah.  You got to go digital. 
[00:56:00]  No.  Back when I was a kid, and I would say it's like 10, 12 minutes to 3.  I would say that.  You must have been a fun kid.  Yeah.  I was a lot of fun back then.  I would have said when I was a kid, what time was it?  I don't know.  Hey, what are you?  Older boy.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to song.  It's the Kaplan Brothers, everyone.  It rubs the lotion on its skin. 
[00:56:30]  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  It helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names. 
[00:57:00]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm in courteous to all your silly whining. 
[00:57:30]  So I'm down before I jam a bath right down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed. 
[00:58:00]  Precious.  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Who the fuck... </pre>
