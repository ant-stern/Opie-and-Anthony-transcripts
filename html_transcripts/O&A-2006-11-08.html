<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous skit about a fictional "ONA virus," setting a tone of irreverent absurdity. Opie, Anthony, and James Norton were introduced, immediately followed by a significant period of technical difficulties with Anthony's microphone.  Despite the interruptions, the show tackled a range of topics.  The midterm elections were heavily discussed, focusing on the Democratic Party's unexpected wins,  the poor performance of their chosen candidate Paul R. Nelson (a real estate agent with intentionally awful campaign ads), and the newly elected governors of New York (Eliot Spitzer) and Massachusetts.  The hosts then delved into a graphic description of a true crime story involving the murder of an actress by an illegal immigrant construction worker, expressing strong opinions about the killer and the death penalty.  The conversation shifted to James Norton's upcoming shows,  before veering into a contentious debate surrounding Anthony's controversial past remarks about Asian Americans and the use of the term "Chinaman."

Further political commentary ensued, laced with racial and ethnic slurs directed at various political figures and groups.  The hosts mocked negative campaign ads (specifically one targeting Bob Menendez) and mimicked the post-election statements of various politicians, highlighting their perceived insincerity. Hillary Clinton’s speaking style and potential future political ambitions were also targets of their mockery, alongside speculation about Barack Obama's potential candidacy.  The show included calls from listeners in Boston, Canada, Yonkers, and Pennsylvania, covering diverse subjects from personal anecdotes to political opinions and near-death experiences.  The technical difficulties returned near the end, bookended by a listener compliment for James Norton and a discussion about the challenges faced by comedians on tour.  Appearances in *FHM* magazine were also mentioned. Rich Voss, Louis C.K., and Dane Cook were announced as upcoming guests.

Rich Vos joined the show in studio, and the conversation immediately turned to his comedy tour, highlighting sold-out shows in Atlanta and upcoming performances in Philadelphia.  The hosts discussed comedy club names, and their shared disdain for certain ones ("Crackers").  The midterm elections were revisited briefly, followed by extensive discussion of Britney Spears's divorce from Kevin Federline ("K-Fed"), utilizing offensive language to describe K-Fed and speculating about his financial gains.  They unsuccessfully attempted to get K-Fed on the phone. A listener mentioned seeing *Borat*, prompting a discussion about the film's popularity and Break.com's successful posting of their Borat interview.  A news story about a doctor in Dublin, Ohio, who allegedly sexually assaulted patients, led to a discussion about a hypothetical "perv switch," accompanied by highly offensive language and crude humor.  The coming out of Neil Patrick Harris was also mentioned.

Dane Cook then joined, discussing his sold-out Madison Square Garden shows and upcoming film roles.  Offensive language and crude jokes continued throughout Cook's appearance.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Bob Kelly, again using offensive language.

A segment featuring Dane Cook, Louis C.K., and Rich Voss in studio began with more discussion of Bob Kelly's perceived foolishness.  A talent show segment was announced, followed by a lengthy discussion centered on Louis C.K.'s experiences as a parent, using offensive language to describe his children and the challenges of parenthood.  The conversation branched into several tangents:  Louis C.K.'s HBO special, the merchandise from his cancelled show "Lucky Louie," the experiences of his fans, Rich Voss's falling asleep (or passing out) during Louis C.K.'s show, Rich Voss's rambling and nonsensical story about a cartoon character, and a disturbing dissection of the lyrics of seemingly innocent children's songs, revealing violent and death-related undertones.  The discussion also included a misspelling of "Mardi Gras" that became a running gag. The segment concluded with plugs for the guests' performances, a mention of an *FHM* appearance, and the hosts' upcoming move to XM satellite radio.  The final part involved the hosts' walk to the XM studio, with commentary on the weather and street observations, including a large umbrella and a documentary about the word "fuck."  The show ended with a final plug for listener calls.


A "dump report" read by Ken detailed sexually explicit and offensive comments from Louis C.K., Dane Cook, and Rich Vos from previous appearances. This included Louis C.K.’s comments about drinking homeless urine and details of his daughter’s bodily functions, Dane Cook's suggestion that everyone should be molested by a younger child, and Rich Vos's comments about penis size and STDs.  The report also covered STDs, childcare, and other offensive topics.  The hosts and Louis C.K. reacted with laughter and shock.  Several audio clips of news reporters making on-air mistakes were played, including mispronunciations of various words and phrases. Louis C.K. and Rich Voss were in studio, promoting their upcoming shows.  A fight between Opie and Anthony was also discussed.


The final excerpt focused on the fallout from a fight between Opie and Jimmy Norton, including the use of bathroom stall doors during commercial breaks and watching porn on-air to alleviate the tension.  The segment included various tangents: caller reactions to a previous segment, a news anchor's on-air slip-up, Louis C.K.'s experience with Edward Norton, a discussion of Louis C.K.’s career, a detailed description of a disastrous Dice stand-up performance including audience fistfights, listener calls about the Dice show, an O&A video contest announcement, accusations against Dice, a listener call defending Opie, Jimmy Norton vomiting on air, a critique of Steve's audio intro, and a caller's anecdote about a crude Opie joke.  Brandon Iron was mentioned as being in the studio with a woman. The segment concluded with promotional information for upcoming shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  In the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves puffed fuels.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out. 
[00:01:00]  Here we go.  Opie.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  This is Paul R. Nelson, and you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  So long, Paul. 
[00:01:30]  So long.  Are you kidding?  Anthony's mic's not working.  Anthony's mic's not working.  Am I on the radio?  Ah, it's the Opie and Jimmy show.  Am I on the radio?  It's Opie and Jimmy.  Where's Anthony?  I'm going to do this show.  Anthony has some impersonations. 
[00:02:00]  I'm going to do this show.  I'm going to do this show today.  I'm going to do this show.  Are you kidding?  How do I not have a goddamn microphone?  I don't want to use this microphone.  This is a crappy guest mic.  And does this even work?  No, your mic does not work today.  Why is it not working?  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's a panic going on in the studio.  We're broadcasting all over the world, and Anthony doesn't have a microphone. 
[00:02:30]  You've got to be.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, boy.  Anthony's not happy.  Wait, I just started.  Did you turn the headphones up a little bit?  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.  That's good.  Stop.  Jesus.  Oh, this sounds like garbage.  I don't know.  All the buttons are pushed.  I have no idea. 
[00:03:00]  I have no idea what's going on.  Great.  All right.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We take a couple days off, and the place falls apart.  Falls apart.  I got to yell.  I'm yelling.  I'm yelling.  Dude, that mic sounds awful, too.  I tell you the truth.  The big fat one.  Tell you the truth.  My mic sounds awful as well.  What do they do here?  I don't know, because.  Just leave stuff alone.  I have to crank my mic so loud that, like in audition, the needles are pinned. 
[00:03:30]  Yep.  And programming's still not in the red.  I know that's a little too technical for some people out there.  I don't know what you mean.  I'm looking at you.  It just means it shouldn't have to go up that high.  I'll tell you what it means.  Hi.  I'll tell you what it means.  All the mics are screwed up.  Somebody screwed with something.  I know my mic's screwed up.  Your mic's not working.  And the guest mic sounds really bassy.  How does mine sound?  Unfortunately, yours sounds perfect.  Unfortunately.  What do you mean? 
[00:04:00]  Just in case you didn't hear me say, unfortunately, let me say it again.  Wait, that's my new joke.  How does it look like I talk?  I should do it the whole show.  Like, realize that no one's laughing after three minutes, but I still do it for another  five hours and 57 minutes.  The first instant feedback.  Paul R. Nelson lost his election.  No S, Sherlock.  Paul, we hardly knew ye.  We knew Paul R. Nelson didn't have a shot.  That's why we went with it.  I don't agree with anything he had to say.  But I also knew ye didn't have a shot in the election.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  Now they're...  Not a shot.  Now they're rewiring your mic.  Think it's the cable?  Yeah, they're hoping.  We'll see what happens.  Actually, I'm going to unplug you for half a second.  All right.  Unplug me.  I'll go back to this.  Oh, my God.  And see if it...  No, it's not the cable.  So the microphone still doesn't work?  The microphone still doesn't work.  No, it works.  Your mic is working.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What? 
[00:05:00]  The mic is working?  Yeah.  How come...  Let me...  Wait.  What part do you have them on?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The headphones weren't up.  You have them on that one?  It's working.  Yeah, it is working.  It's working now.  Yeah.  Get that out of here.  All right.  Are we ready to broadcast?  Should we start over or something?  No.  No one will know that we have to start over.  That's good.  Oh, my God.  What a way to start.  That's good.  Perfect.  Son of a bitch. 
[00:05:30]  Should we just take a break and do take two?  Why?  Because I'm annoyed now.  I'm annoyed.  Take a break, and then you're annoyed.  We take a break, and everybody listening is annoyed.  True.  Good point.  All right.  Well, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  There we go.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-4.  Good morning to everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning to America.  Good morning to Canada.  How did your candidate fare?  Did you have a candidate? 
[00:06:00]  Paul R. Nelson.  Yeah, we had Paul R. Nelson, and he lost.  Let's face it.  We knew he didn't even have a shot.  Not a chance in hell.  But we couldn't get enough of his negative campaign ads, and we had to go with it.  We just liked that his ads really stunk up the joint.  Yeah.  He was pounding on, what was his candidate's name?  Ron kind.  Ron kind.  I keep thinking wrong kind.  Well, he was the right kind.  He apparently was the right kind. 
[00:06:30]  By a landslide.  To everybody else.  Yeah, he really kicked his ass, man.  Oh, man.  Paul R. Nelson, back to the real estate.  Okay, one day I'm running for office.  The next, this is a lovely bathroom.  You could see the tile floor is easy to keep clean.  He's going to just be walking through houses, trying to sell them.  God, if I lived in that area, though, I'd search him out if I was in the market for a house. 
[00:07:00]  I still say that's what he was doing.  This is just kind of a goof.  Just pumping his name?  Yeah, he saw like Ron kind was running.  Didn't see anybody really running against him.  He's a real estate agent there, Paul R. Nelson.  So he figures, I'll run.  I'll get some FaceTime on TV.  It'll help my real estate business.  And now people know his name.  They know his face in the area.  And they'll probably go, I want that Paul R. Nelson to sell me a house.  There you go.  What else can we say about the election? 
[00:07:30]  Well, the Dems clean house, according to the New York Post.  Dems clean house.  Dems.  Well, they have control of the house now, right?  Yeah.  And how about Congress?  Senate is still up.  And Senate is what?  I think it's, look, look, look.  I got knowledge today.  Republicans, 49 seats.  Democrats.  No, I'm not.  I'm saying look as in look at me.  Oh, I was looking at the TV behind me.  Because I was pointing.  No, I was like, look at me with knowledge.  And you decided because I was pointing that I needed you to look at the TV. 
[00:08:00]  I thought your knowledge was coming from that huge Panasonic plasma behind me.  Not really.  Who's the new president?  Yeah.  Who is he?  What's his name?  All right.  The Senate, 49 for the Republicans, 47 seats for the Democrats, two independents in there.  Yeah.  And I think two undecideds, two elections still up for grabs.  Too close to call, they say.  Too close to call.  But it's obvious the Bush factor really came into play this midterm election. 
[00:08:30]  And a lot of people said, screw the Republicans, went with the Democrats.  And we'll see what happens.  Well, nothing's going to get done in the White House for the rest of Bush's term.  Not like anything was getting done.  Well, a few things were.  Some really bad religious-based legislation was being passed through with no problem.  So hopefully that'll stop.  Yeah.  But Bush is going to veto everything that they come up with. 
[00:09:00]  It's just going to be a bottleneck where nothing's going to get done.  Why can't they just work together?  They're worse than they ever were.  That's the obvious thing to do.  Just work together.  It'll never happen, though.  Of course they're supposed to work together.  Work together for the best for the people of this grand nation of ours.  No, they work for the best of the party.  They work for the best of the party and the best of themselves.  They don't give a crap about you and I. 
[00:09:30]  And the best for themselves, whatever's best for them, to keep their job as long as possible.  And that's about it.  Hey, we want to keep it kind of fun and airy.  So let's go right to Boston and say hi to Pat.  Pat, what's up?  Breaking news out of Boston.  Go ahead, Pat.  Boston, you make the announcement, Pat.  Yeah, Lieutenant Governor, we got a docky.  See, this is coming from Boston.  Boston, did you just say we got a docky? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we got a docky.  You know what's so funny?  Travis wrote on the screen, we got a donkey.  He heard a donkey.  Well, the Boston accent's a little strange, you know.  I'll give you that one, Travis.  But he wanted to say we got a docky.  Is that your lieutenant governor or governor?  He hung up.  He hung up.  I don't know.  Massachusetts has a black governor now.  That's nice of Massachusetts.  That's kind of changing the image of Massachusetts.  Although, you know, Ted Kennedy, of course, slid right through. 
[00:10:30]  He'll never, ever, ever lose.  The corpse of Ted Kennedy is going to run and win.  When God forbid, God forbid when he dies.  They will not let that guy go.  They love that fat drunk.  They don't like change.  They're like the same guys over and over.  That's it.  Over and over.  That's what it is.  You don't like change.  You're dumb, Boston.  You're dumb.  Boston people do not like change.  We have ourselves here now a Democrat as a governor.  Bye-bye, George Pataki. 
[00:11:00]  Hello, Elliot Spitzer.  What a lovely name.  Hello, Elliot Spitzer.  Hello, Elliot Spitzer is now the Democrat who is the governor of New York.  More importantly, he's a party pooper.  He doesn't like that plugola and payola stuff.  He's been what we call the tattletale.  He's been the tattletale of New York for years.  He's the guy that goes around and finds out if a restaurant has cockroaches in their kitchen 
[00:11:30]  and then reports it.  He's like the political version of the shame, shame, shame on you news guy.  Yeah, you don't want Elliot Spitzer's office calling you ever.  No, he's the tattletale.  It's never good.  The little buddinski.  Snitch.  Yeah.  Hello, this is Jessica from Elliot Spitzer's office.  Oh, I'm not here.  Is Anthony Cumia there?  No!  What did I do wrong?  Tell Mr. Spitzer I left and I'll call him later. 
[00:12:00]  No more cocaine for music, guys.  That's it.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  No more little packets of cocaine so you play the latest record from name band here.  Kajagoogoo.  Right.  Oh, Jimmy.  No.  It's his name that's so unfriendly.  Elliot Swallower just sounds so much more nicer.  Sounds more pleasurable.  We got a Democrat.  Yeah.  It's a Democratic state in New York.  But, you know, first when Pataki had a couple terms in there, the last one was Cuomo, and 
[00:12:30]  remember what a disaster he was.  It just always seems like the state kind of goes broke when there's a Democrat in there.  And the Republican being the governor doesn't really have as much impact on what, you know,  religious crap, like, you know, the right wing coming in.  It doesn't really seem to affect us like that.  Right.  So Pataki wasn't that bad to have in there.  Pataki actually brought us back the death penalty. 
[00:13:00]  Thank God, New York State.  The death penalty.  How long was he in there?  Eight years?  How long?  More?  Ten?  I don't even know.  Pataki was in there for 85 years.  Never used the death penalty because we had, uh...  Robert Johnson wouldn't go for it.  I think he was the guy with the Bronx, right?  He won't go for it.  They won't go for it, these stupid, uh...  Then you know what?  Then just...  Then just get rid of it.  Well, you'll see that happening with Elliot Spencer.  Well, I'd rather not have a death penalty than have a death penalty and not use it. 
[00:13:30]  Or fire the guys that won't go after it and represent the state properly.  You're telling me in all the years we've had the death penalty, there hasn't been one case  where somebody really deserved to be put to death in New York?  You can't think of one horrid murder case.  How about the latest case in the paper?  Oh, this one.  This has to be a national story.  This actress...  Might have heard about this actress at 40 years old.  I don't even know any of the movies she was in.  But on the indie scene, she was pretty big. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  And she had this office in the village that she would go to because I guess she was,  like, I think she was kind of a producer, screenwriter, maybe director.  She did a lot of that stuff on the side.  And she would escape her newborn and, you know, the craziness of her house to go to  the village to get some work done.  Get some work done.  So she's in the village.  But just say the story for people that everyone heard.  What?  We're getting there.  She hung herself.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, the story goes she hung herself in this apartment away from her husband 
[00:14:30]  and her newborn.  Well, it turns out there was a savage that killed her.  Yeah.  Basically, what happens, she's up in this quiet office trying to get work done.  And there's some workers down below redoing an apartment.  And they're making a little too much noise.  So she goes down to kind of have a confrontation.  Which, by the way, not blaming anybody for ending up dead.  She obviously came face to face with an animal.  But you know something?  You got to mind your own business sometimes.  You just never know. 
[00:15:00]  You just don't know because there's too many animals out there that will kill you.  So her going downstairs to tell construction guys to be quiet because she's working upstairs.  What do you think?  They're going to be quiet?  Right.  No.  And there was an altercation.  I've heard many different things.  I heard she slapped the guy.  She was pushed out after the guy banged a hammer on the ground.  Much like the chimpanzee banging a bone in 2001, A Space Odyssey.  Yeah.  He then pushed her out the door.  Right.  She came back in and smacked him in the face. 
[00:15:30]  To which he, as a civil human being, rolled up his fist and punched her right in the face.  As hard as he could.  And knocked her out.  Knocked her out.  Thought she was dead.  This is where the story gets absolutely sick.  Yeah.  Thought she was dead.  He's an illegal immigrant.  So he's like, oh God, I'm going to be deported.  Takes a sheet.  So he drags her up into this apartment that she was using.  By the neck with the sheet, by the way.  Oh, I didn't know that part.  Yep.  That's the latest?  That's the latest.  Okay.  Took the sheet, tied it around her neck, and dragged her by the neck upstairs. 
[00:16:00]  And then hung her from her own shower rod.  To make a shower curtain rod or whatever.  To make it look like she hung herself in the bathroom.  Who was he working with?  Was he alone?  Two other guys in there, but they weren't in the same area as he was.  And she must have hit him pretty hard because he had a black eye or some action around his eye.  And he's like, oh, that was from another altercation with one of the workers.  And then they also found Nike sneaker prints on the toilet and in the bathtub that didn't match what she was wearing. 
[00:16:30]  So the guy was obviously a brain surgeon when it comes to covering up his tracks.  I know what sucks, you know, the husband finds her.  Yeah.  And then the cops and the detectives, like, question the husband for five hours.  Well, of course.  I know.  That's commonplace because it usually is.  Huh?  Because it usually is.  You watch those A&E shows.  Right.  And he was like, look, I just know my wife would never, ever.  Because the guy almost got away with it.  Because supposedly the first detectives on the scene were like, well, or it couldn't be the first officially. 
[00:17:00]  But they thought the footprint was from one of the crime scene guys getting sloppy.  Yeah.  So they just assumed there was a crime scene guy getting sloppy.  Like, you know.  Suicide, write it off.  Yeah, yeah.  But then the husband's like, no, she would have never, ever killed herself.  We got to, you know, keep going here.  And sure enough, they figured it out really fast.  So why shouldn't that guy get the death penalty?  Absolutely.  That is sick.  What is he going to do for society? 
[00:17:30]  He's, what, 19 years old.  He's just worthless.  He's worthless.  Worthless.  He's worthless.  He paid 12 grand to come here illegally, him and his brother, living in some basement apartment somewhere,  doing menial work, trying to pay back his slave wage, I guess.  Just another animal up here that, you know, some people think should have all the rights in the world.  He had a driver's license.  Yeah, driver's license, everything else, hospital care.  Give him everything.  But that's what we're dealing with.  And there's cases a lot worse than that. 
[00:18:00]  But we just don't use the death penalty that we have on the books here in New York.  Isn't it amazing, though, like that woman was just annoyed, like, ah, right, with the racket.  And as she marched downstairs, she had no idea she was about to be murdered.  Yeah.  Well, that's another thing.  You just can't do that.  Although, why'd she slap the guy?  I know.  What are you thinking, stupid?  She called him a son of a bitch, which the guy said he took literally.  Because, I guess, you know, in his country, when you say that, you're calling him a mother.  My mother.  My mother.  Then why'd you leave her in that mud hole that you came from? 
[00:18:30]  That crap hole that you left her in if you loved her so much.  I take literally.  I'm a mother.  Son of bitch.  Shut up.  Die.  I hate people that are too defensive about their mothers.  Hey, don't go with my mother.  Shut up.  Enough.  F you and F her.  But that's just a lie.  She didn't deserve what she got.  That's for sure.  But you know something?  Stay upstairs.  Deal with the noise.  Turn your radio up louder. 
[00:19:00]  Do something.  Because the second you interact with people, especially in this city, the second there's  any interaction with strangers, it's going to be trouble.  Yeah, because no one wants to be told what to do.  So as soon as you're told what to do, whatever you were doing to annoy that person, you make  sure you do a little more.  Yeah.  That's just how human nature is.  Do you think the guy's boss that told him to make that noise, it was the boss?  Do you think he just decided, I'm just going to make some noise? 
[00:19:30]  Baa.  Baa.  No, he's got some guy that he don't like.  Telling him to do something.  Then he's got to get it done.  And then some, you know, woman comes down and tells you to knock it off.  You're not going to stop.  You don't have to smack her and then punch her and choke her.  That's for sure.  Stop with the punching.  Well, it's like, why not just, if you're an illegal, why not just apologize and go,  oh, I'll keep it down.  Shut your dumb mouth.  Yeah.  What do you think's going to happen?  You're here illegally.  Right. 
[00:20:00]  Try to keep a low profile, dummy.  No, just, somebody just shoot him.  All right.  We've got to take our first break.  Just getting warmed up.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America today on the program.  Rich Voss coming in to say hi.  We've got Louis C.K. coming back.  Yeah, very good.  That's very, very cool.  And Dane Cook calling today around 9 o'clock.  It's, yeah, it's the show and we'll be back, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now. 
[00:20:30]  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWMEET05.  That's 866-WOWMEET05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:21:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Little Jimmy Norton in studio, of course, like he is every day.  And you've got a big show on Friday, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  I'm doing the Hammerstein Friday night with our own Nathaniel and my buddy Artie Fuqua.  And I'm going to have another comic.  I just don't know who the third comic is going to be.  Probably a Chinaman.  Oh, sorry.  We're not allowed to say that.  Wait, what happened with the Chinaman?  I don't know.  I just got yelled at.  I just got yelled at for saying Chinaman?  He was supposed to address it this morning, so we should see if he's addressing it. 
[00:21:30]  It said, oh, he'll probably address it in the morning.  I don't know.  Is it John Liu again?  I just heard of Anthony.  He's taking the cause of all Asians at this point.  He was talking about the election and said something about not voting or voting for a fat Chinaman, as he called him.  And he got some flack for it.  You're not allowed to say Chinaman anymore?  Chinaman, apparently, from what I read yesterday, Chinaman is a derogatory term for Asians that was used when they helped build the railroads back in the 1800s. 
[00:22:00]  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  Who knew that?  I did a nice job at the railroads.  I'm going to thank them.  They did.  Those tracks, perfect.  True.  Straight as an aloe. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, man.  This country is so doomed.  I don't know.  Did I misapologize?  I hope not.  Please don't apologize.  This is an opportunity for him to, you know, do some good radio.  Just say, screw up.  If he starts groveling today, I lose a lot of respect for Mr. Iams.  I absolutely can't picture him.  If he apologizes, it'll probably be so awful and sarcastic.  I should have used the term everybody uses a chunk.  Chunk.  A couple of fat chinks is a chunk. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  8.05.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Hey, uh.  Chinaman.  We were watching the election coverage like everyone else this morning, I guess.  And, um.  Yeah.  Something Anthony brought up on the show weeks ago came true.  But, you know, it was an obvious one.  Yeah.  You know, these guys with their negative political ads, they go after each other's throats.  They're jugulars.  And then after the election's over, they're buddy-buddy and they're thanking each other. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, after some of the worst campaigning we've ever seen.  Uh, you would think they would just say, hey, go screw yourself.  I hope you fail miserably.  But, no.  Well, we had a race in this area, Tom Keene and Bob Menendez.  Menendez.  Menendez.  That was, uh, in Jersey.  And, uh, it got ugly.  Real ugly.  And they were hinting that Bob Menendez, you can barely say his name, is kind of like a mafia guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's always that whole mafia thing.  They like doing the mafia tie-in. 
[00:24:00]  Even though there's no mafia tie-in, they love doing that in Jersey.  Right.  It's a quickie.  This is a 30-second, uh, ad for Tom Keene and anti-Bob Menendez.  Listen to this.  You got a problem.  Our boy down in Washington, Bob Menendez, he's caught in this federal investigation.  Right.  Feds start looking at these fixed contracts.  Bada-bing.  We're in it.  But deep.  And worse, this guy Tom Keene, he wants to clean things up.  He even cuts taxes.  Hey, where's our take in that?  We need to get the bosses to fix this thing.  Like he did for Torricelli. 
[00:24:30]  You got Lombard's number?  Tell Bob Menendez his high-tax record is a crime.  The Free Enterprise Fund Committee is responsible for the content that is advertised.  Advertisement.  The content that is...  They make it sound all guineed up.  Right, right.  All dirty and mobbed up.  Did he have to say bada-bing?  Bada-bing.  Of course, because the dummies that wouldn't have understood that that was supposed to be  mob-related, then they would have gotten it.  Yeah, because we all watch The Sopranos.  What's he saying?  So he's like insinuating that Menendez was in the mob. 
[00:25:00]  Mafia.  Yeah.  He was mobbed up.  Yeah.  Well, Menendez won the election, and this is what Tom Keene had to say last night.  Oh, Menendez won.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is what Tom Keene had to say.  Bada-bing.  Dang.  He won.  After saying some pretty awful things in his TV spots, here's Tom Keene last night.  I want to congratulate Bob Menendez.  On his victory tonight, he ran a spirited race, and I join all of New Jersey in wishing 
[00:25:30]  him well.  We have hard work to do on a bipartisan basis, and I wish him all the best.  I'm not going away.  Oh, they all say that.  Shut up.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Would it be funny if you said, I got to go?  I'm going to go home and put my head in the oven.  Right.  I'm not going away.  You never hear from these guys ever again.  I won't make it out of the parking lot, folks.  I've had it.  I mean, some of the up-and-comers, you know, they lose an election, and then they become 
[00:26:00]  stars.  Yes.  But in general, these guys all say that election night, and you don't even remember their names  in a week or two.  Why can't they just be honest?  Why couldn't he go, I can't believe New Jersey that you voted for that jerk-off?  That criminal that I was saying was mobbed up.  Didn't you hear my ads?  Right.  What's wrong with you people?  I wish them the best.  Oh, my God.  I wish them the best.  You can help this vermin if you feel like it, but if I were you, I would just say the  next four years are going to suck. 
[00:26:30]  I'll be back.  I'm moving.  I'm moving out of Jersey.  I suggest you all flee the state.  Or if he scolded the voters.  Thanks for nothing, faggots.  That's what I would do.  Where were you?  You never hear that.  No, no, now let's get our support behind the winner here.  That's what they do.  Why?  There's a lot of people in the...  Who are the people that show up at the parties and everything?  And boo, no, no, yeah.  Yeah, no, no, no, people. 
[00:27:00]  People now, we must throw our support behind the man that won this election.  Why are you doing a Hillary Clinton all of a sudden?  Because a couple of other politicians have been talking like that.  Elliot Spitzer I heard on the way in was horrendous.  Like, what an awful speaking voice he has.  He's got that political guy speech.  He should whisper and then just play it loud.  He's terrible.  What a bore.  We're going to turn around New York State and make it the state.  It's a...  But it was, do you want to join me on this journey? 
[00:27:30]  Shut up.  Guys, I think Hillary's becoming a star.  Oh, stop it.  She's becoming a star.  It was a shoe-in to win this.  Big, fat shoe-in.  There was no way she was going to lose.  What's she going to do, though?  In two years, is she going to drop out of her job?  Yeah, she's going for the White House. 
[00:28:00]  And go for the White House?  Absolutely.  Under the...  Obama!  ...goof Democrat ticket?  Oh, please.  Oh, I hope that those two run together.  Oh, please.  Be nice to see a clean 50 to nothing sweep.  Exactly.  You want a Republican in office?  Democrats?  Yeah, make them your front runners.  I'm rooting for the Democrats.  Democrats, I'm sticking to Republicans.  Can we have one good Democrat, please?  Good Democratic candidate.  Obama.  Someone that's a little moderate.  Doesn't have to be a bleeding heart liberal. 
[00:28:30]  Obama?  No.  Maybe as a vice president.  Maybe Barack Obama as a vice president.  Can I say white?  He's almost white.  What?  Nothing?  He's almost white.  Relax.  His lip color bothers me.  It's purplish.  He looks like he's freezing to death always.  He's almost white.  How many times have people walked in and said, is it cold in here?  And he went, no, why?  There are enough people out there that will go, yeah, he's almost white.  All right.  Nah.  Ah, then there's the hardcores.  I get it.  One drop of black blood, no way. 
[00:29:00]  Middle America.  But there are those fringe players that will go, ah, he's almost white.  What the hell?  Middle America.  That's what I'm thinking.  Ain't voting.  That's what I'm thinking.  Ain't voting a black guy in.  Middle America.  It ain't gonna happen.  Well, at least he's charismatic and interesting to watch.  So is Farrakhan.  Yeah, but, yeah, you're right, actually.  If he ran, I would move to Chicago and vote for him.  I would vote for Farrakhan in a second.  I would love to just watch him talk all day.  I hear he's got a case of a pudding head-itis these days.  Does he really?  Yeah, I think something's going on. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, all right.  Medical problems.  Yeah.  He probably refuses to use white doctors.  You know, those guys are.  Yeah.  It's like Khalid Muhammad from the Nation of Islam.  He got shot.  He would only go with white ambulance people.  He'd lynch, like a lynch, put leeches on him.  What happened?  Was that a slip?  Oops.  I don't know.  If I was a newsman, I'd be fired.  I'm asking if you want a banana.  You're like, sure, I'd love some strange fruit.  Hey, hold yourself.  Yeah, really.  I'd be fired for that one.  Hey, can we get some Hillary speech?  Can you get your spitzer, too?  Yeah, spitzer and Hillary.  I heard that coming out.  That was just awful. 
[00:30:00]  Talks that way.  Can you do your Hillary Clinton?  We have been elected again to this great office, and I will serve New York like I have for the past term.  It always starts normal with her.  Like, the engine's revving up.  She's got to work on that, man.  Oh, it's never going to work for a, you know, and I want to be your president.  I want to be your next president because I feel I can do a good job for 26 days out of a month. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, I bet.  Oh, boy, we're all going to suffer, huh?  Oh, stop.  She's not bingo spotting the couches.  Our taxes go way up for four days a month.  That just declares war on a country.  Right.  Calls it off a few days later and says, I'm sorry.  I don't know what I was thinking.  Declares war on Alabama. 
[00:31:00]  What?  What happened?  Oh, I was having a bad day.  Oh, whatever.  John Kerry wasn't such an awful bore and, like, just a terribly insincere looking guy.  I'd probably like him.  Oh, wow.  He only has a few things to work on, I guess, huh, Jim?  Jesus.  He would have actually...  I would have went with you if you said if he could only get a better haircut or something.  There's something about him that bugs me.  I don't know what it is.  It's like there's something about him that bugs me. 
[00:31:30]  That's what it is.  He is just a block of cement that walks.  He is an awful nothing.  He's a horrid man without any personality, and that's why he lost.  And it was still close.  And he can't even make a joke properly.  No.  He just fumbles it.  And all the soldiers are idiots.  No, I meant it against Bush.  I was goofing on Bush when I said that if you're fighting in Iraq, you must be a complete blithering idiot.  Two Jews walk into a bar. 
[00:32:00]  9-11's funny.  Wait, what happened?  What am I doing?  They caused 9-11.  Wait.  Wait.  Yeah, if you can't tell a joke, you know.  What an ass.  You shouldn't be in politics.  What an ass.  It's so worth.  And then I see Joe Lieberman as an independent.  You put Velcro on the ceiling.  Wait a minute.  It was a joke.  I swear.  Three, if you slice them thin enough. 
[00:32:30]  Can I do one?  Yeah, I got it, Jerry.  An empty boat.  Cause 9-11.  It would be a good start.  You'll wear his lips and stick them to the window.  I was joking.  Dang.  What?  This ain't funny?  But he's so stupid he would say that about Jews.  Yeah.  Or about Polish people.  Yeah, that's the bit.  He just doesn't get it right.  All right.  Yeah, and then Joe Lieberman there is an independent one in Connecticut. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  He has the worst voice in politics.  He lost a primary and then he wins the election.  Then he wins the election.  Who knew?  What's wrong with his voice?  I don't remember.  I haven't heard of him.  Oh, he's just very monotone.  Very.  Let's put it this way.  I don't think that voice would sell in the Midwest.  I don't think he'll be running for president with that voice.  It sounds very ethnic.  Oh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Corey in Canada.  Corey.  Hey, how's it going there?  Hey.  Hey, Corey.  How you doing? 
[00:33:30]  Marking right on.  You guys rock, man.  Thank you.  Hey, thank you.  Thank you, Corey, from Canada.  I try to listen as much as I can, but you guys got to get in with the same time.  What time frame is us up here?  What time is it?  It's 20 to 5 in the morning right now.  Oh, jeez.  20 to 5 in Canada.  How does that work?  Well, we're fine.  I know, like, Vancouver is three hours behind.  Where is it two hours behind?  It's in the middle somewhere.  The country is as wide as ours. 
[00:34:00]  So it's not a bad place.  Yeah, but it's Canada.  You think just one time.  It's not as important, so I think they just cut it in half and go, all right, we'll give  you a couple extra hours over here.  Your friends across the street is three hours getting in.  Right.  No one's going to know.  We're going to wait until Hillary gets in there and invades us.  All right, wait a minute now.  You're in Canada.  Why are you up so early in that awful cold country?  What do you do for a living?  I work in an oil patch.  Oh, God.  Ah, oil.  An oil patch?  Yeah.  Drilling rigs.  Drilling for oil.  Yeah, you're a driller, huh? 
[00:34:30]  Yes, yes.  Driving home right now.  I've been driving for seven hours.  Does your truck just smell like fuel oil?  Uh, four or less, yeah.  Yeah, that's a dirty job, man.  My friend's dad used to work with oil, and when I ate over his house, and his hands were  so dirty from work that when he held his bread to eat it, you could see the black fingerprints  in his bread.  Oh, boy.  For not, uh, he just, I guess he would just come home drunk.  I'm not washed.  Yeah, he didn't really wash his hands.  You guys, you guys do realize if you find a lot of oil, we're taking you over, right?  You guys find just enough oil to be able to- 
[00:35:00]  Keep yourself going.  Yeah, to keep your country.  You hit a big one, though?  You find a pot of dinosaurs somewhere?  It's over, Johnny.  We're coming to get you.  You guys will all of a sudden be the number one terrorist in the world, and we will have  to come over there and kick your ass.  The only reason we haven't taken you guys over, because, yeah, you don't really have anything  we want.  That's the only reason.  Canada's starting a nuclear program.  Are they?  Canada's starting a nuclear program, and we gotta, now, nip this in the bud. 
[00:35:30]  So we're sending troops up there.  We got nothing here.  What?  We got nothing up here for fucking armies.  We got all armies going.  You got a potty mouth, I hear.  Yeah, you got a potty mouth.  Yeah, a little bit.  What's your army?  It's just a bunch of guys on horses in those red suits, right?  Yeah, the Mounties.  Yeah, the Mounties.  Guy's proud of his Mounties.  That's the biggest joke I've ever seen.  I love the Canadians, man.  Yeah, you guys are. 
[00:36:00]  You can't help but love him like a retarded little brother.  By the way, all right, Corey, we gotta go.  Schwarzenegger is actually very good.  I like him.  He talks pretty well.  Well, I got some audio.  I'm the governor.  You're joking, right?  I mean, like, as he doesn't yell, he just talks like Arnold.  Oh, okay.  He talks like Arnold.  Abominable, but it's Arnold.  We got audio in front of us.  Awful Arnold victory quote from Fox 5.  Here's the Arnold quote.  Listen to this.  Get to the chopper.  We won.  After 12 years in the minority, Democrats are returning to power in the U.S. House. 
[00:36:30]  They needed 15 seats, but actually beat out more than two dozen Republicans.  Their likely new leader would be the first female in history to serve as Speaker of the House.  The American people voted for a new direction.  That's a speaker?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  That's a speaker of the House?  The first one?  That's the first one?  The speaker of the House that sounds like that should be speaking, your dinner is ready.  Exactly.  It's the only speaker of the House. 
[00:37:00]  When they walk in, she should say, take your shoes off, they're muddy.  That's what she should be yelling at all the congressmen and senators.  Get some coffee for the men.  She should be forced to wear lingerie.  For all those old guys.  The speaker of the House.  We'll allow you to have the job, but here's your uniform.  Look what Bush did.  Look what he did.  How bad did this guy screw up?  There's a black Muslim elected up in Minnesota. 
[00:37:30]  Boston's got a black governor.  There's a woman Speaker of the House.  And people are actually considering Obama for president.  And Hillary for president.  And Hillary.  Yeah.  Way to go, Bush.  Way to go.  They had a nice run.  12 years.  Wow.  They had 12 years.  Wow.  Did you blow this one?  It's like a freak show.  It would be the first female in history to serve as Speaker of the House.  The American people voted for a new direction to restore civility and bipartisanship in Washington, D.C. 
[00:38:00]  Democrats say a powerful.  Oh, my God.  No one's restoring bipartisanship, by the way.  And civility.  Who cares about civility?  I'm going to be civil.  Excuse me.  Go F yourself.  Excuse me, hole.  I was talking.  Oh, sorry.  I was the speaker.  But I'm being civil.  Oh, my God.  They got to deepen her voice or something.  Yeah, that's not a Speaker of the House voice.  Speaker of the House is like, has that commanding voice. 
[00:38:30]  And now the President of the United States, you know, you got to speak.  Yeah.  Can't be, yeah, the President's coming in.  What?  Speak up, Speaker.  And I'll be selling Tupperware in the hallways after this.  Great.  The locking lid really locks in flavor.  If you need a birthday present for your wife, I'll be out in the hall.  Good.  I'll be handing out brownies while he talks.  Oh.  You're on.  Will you?  Will you?  Will you?  B.C. 
[00:39:00]  Democrats say a powerful wave of anger over the war in Iraq propelled them to victory  in the House.  They also will control the governorship in at least 28 states, their first majority in  more than a decade.  But in California, one famous Republican held on to his job.  I love doing sequels.  But this, without any doubt, is my favorite sequel.  Ah.  Arnold's doing a sequel.  You've got to make a movie joke.  Most sequels stink, though, so I wouldn't have gone there.  This is a sequel.  No, this is like Terminator sequel. 
[00:39:30]  It's good.  But he said sequel twice because he didn't get hurt in the first time.  I love doing sequels.  This is my favorite sequel.  My favorite sequel to be a sequel.  I love the sequel.  Sequel.  He said sequel twice, this jackass.  He did.  Yes.  I love doing sequels.  And this is by far my favorite sequel.  Sequel.  He said this is my favorite.  In this sequel, I'm going to play Brad Johnson, your governor. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  It's going to be great.  Terrorists take over the governor's mansion.  I have to fight them off with a machine gun.  Ah.  Sequel, sequel.  Yeah, I get that again where he missed.  Sequel, sequel.  He realized it got stepped on.  You want to hear a sequel?  Yeah, sequel, sequel.  He pulled one of these.  He knew it got stepped on and had to do it again.  One famous Republican held on to his job.  I love doing sequels.  But this, without any doubt, is my favorite sequel. 
[00:40:30]  He did it three times.  Dude, he did it three times.  Listen.  No.  Underneath when she's talking, you hear him say sequel the first time.  Oh, really?  I didn't catch that.  Listen to this close.  States, their first majority in more than a decade.  But in California, one famous Republican held on to his job.  I love doing sequels.  Oh, yeah.  Because I love doing sequels.  This is my favorite sequel.  I love doing sequels.  This is my favorite sequel.  Say it again.  It's more effective.  Let's go to Dennis in Yonkers.  Dennis?  Hey, what's up, Owen A?  Hey. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, you guys know that the Speaker of the House is third in line to be president if something happens to push and chain.  Well, really?  Yeah.  What could possibly happen?  And now Bush dies, then Cheney finds out there's a heart attack.  I think it happened pretty easily, actually.  Oh, wow.  Jesus.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to...  I think Cheney's been dead for three years.  They're just kind of propping him up and, like, moving his lips like a marionette.  That was a good one.  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania. 
[00:41:30]  John.  Hey, what's up?  Thank you.  He's got a skid.  I spun out, and right now I'm holding the wheel going...  It was almost awful.  We've all had one of those.  Almost.  Holy, holy crap.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I should have had a Jane Mansfield decapitation.  Right.  But I wound up just missing.  I love those when, like, the second you stop, you think to yourself, wow, I should be a  lot more freaked out than this. 
[00:42:00]  And then...  And then it hits you, like, a couple of seconds later.  I remember my friend Steve and I were high.  We were crossing Route 130.  Of course you are.  We were crossing on Route 130, crossing Route 1.  And we had the green light, and we went, and we heard...  And an 18-wheeler ripped in front of us, ran the light.  And his back wheels ripped off my friend's...  Oh, my God.  Ripped off my friend's bumper.  He was doing probably 70 miles.  He couldn't stop.  And that...  The only reason we stopped was because we actually heard the horrible horn. 
[00:42:30]  And I saw it as it was a tanker truck coming, and I...  Oh, God.  You could have been still dead.  And it's amazing how you think, like, this is my death.  You think that you're dead.  Yeah, here it comes.  And they exchanged information afterwards, and we pulled across the thing, and then  my friend just pulled over and started crying.  Did you have to hold him?  No, I don't...  I just kind of sat there in a state of shock, too.  The back...  Oh, my God.  The back wheels ripped the bumper off.  Oh, wow.  I mean, it was literally a second away from us being killed. 
[00:43:00]  Less than a second.  Yeah, that's way less than a second, Jimmy.  I don't want to...  That's fractions of a second away from death.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't even calculate how close it was.  That is...  He got through the whole thing of exchanging information, though.  The guy tried to give him money.  Before he started crying.  Yeah, but then he'd get back in the car.  Steve was a weird guy.  He used to smoke and flick his ashes on the rug.  He was a psycho.  He had dark, creepy, like, pedophile glasses, like the tinted glasses.  And then we just parked...  We went across the highway, pulled over to the shoulder, and he cried.  Oh, wow. 
[00:43:30]  You got to give it to him, though, man.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't call him a faggot.  I would love to go, you know, call him the...  You almost get run over by a tractor trailer, yeah.  I would love to call him the P-word, but I think I would be crying, too.  You're bumperless.  Oh, wow.  Hey, John, Pennsylvania, what's up?  Yeah, I want to say Sean Hannity's a closet homosexual.  Why?  And you love him so much.  Wait, is that what you wanted to say?  No reason?  Yeah, I just wanted to say it.  I don't...  Hold on.  What, sir?  Wow, he had to be tased. 
[00:44:00]  No, he's gone.  Oh, good.  He had to be tased.  What do you think?  I like it.  Believe me, you're not getting any arguments over from this corner.  Sean Hannity.  I'd be happy if you really...  Yeah, he's not gay.  What he wanted to say on the comments was that he thinks I'm a Republican.  See how wrong people get things?  Oh, he's not a Republican.  I'd probably lean more...  Absolutely.  ...Democrat, which is a little bizarre because, you know, I'm rich.  You lean more...  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  You'd definitely lean more Democrat.  But I spend most of my life being poor.  Not even lean.  Someone that leans is a little more on the fence.  I don't know.  Honestly...  You're a little firmer in the Democratic camp.  I like to vote for the individual.  Ah, that's that good.  That's the new thing out there, man.  Vote for the individual.  Yeah, man.  Not the party, man.  Man.  All right.  Yes.  Worst O&A media photo ever.  You're right, Fast Freddy.  What is that?  We should talk about that next.  We should get Rich Voss in here next. 
[00:45:00]  We got some Hillary victory speech where she does that, bah, bah, bah, bah.  You want to take us to break as Hillary Clinton...  Remember, it starts off nice.  Ladies and gentlemen, we will be back with more of the Opie and Anthony show with Jimmy  Norton in a couple of minutes after these five words.  No.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  What's the problem?  How's it going?  Was it good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It started off.  It was completely disconnected from what he was saying.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:45:30]  He knew the words, but there was no love in it.  Yeah, but I didn't know where to jump in with my ak-ak, because I'd like to join in on  the bid a little bit.  I don't understand the double ak-ak, since it's a single woman.  Because I get...  No.  Did I just stop doing it?  No, no, no.  And you do the ak-ak?  You're missing what we're doing together here.  What are we doing?  You're Hillary.  Yeah.  And then I'm the audience, ak-ing, ak-ing, because you're ak-ing.  Oh, see, if you would have harumphed.  Harumphed.  I would have understood.  Because the ak-ak is her political talk.  But she's talking to the ak-aks. 
[00:46:00]  She's talking to the ak-aks.  She's the queen of the ak-aks, and I'm representing the ak-aks.  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  Ak-ak-ak-ak-ak.  See, each ak-ak-ak-ak is different people.  That's like a cheer?  Yeah.  Okay.  We've been doing it for years like that.  It's worked fine.  I thought you were jumping in and having fun with the Hillary thing.  Oh.  Oh, now I get it.  While you two are laughing and having fun, K-Fed is alone.  Yeah, we'll talk about that.  All right, I know, and I'm heartbroken for her.  Britney Spears is the biggest dummy in the world. 
[00:46:30]  She is just a dope.  And she tried to gussy her.  Ah, we'll get into it next.  Gussy.  She freaking wrecks this body of hers, and now she thinks she's going to go back and be  this huge singing star again?  Hang it out.  Ha ha!  Stretch marks!  Bye-bye.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of The Opie and Anthony Show are appearing  in a special holiday edition of FHM.  On sale now.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  You're checking out The Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Walter in Indianapolis.  Walter, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, ma'am.  Hey, I saw a boss last weekend in Indianapolis.  Jim and Bonnie absolutely killed.  Boss, you are awesome, brother.  Boss, you are the...  Boss, how long have you been doing our radio show?  I'm not in front of you.  What am I supposed to do?  Oh, my God.  Get some headphones. 
[00:47:30]  So a river came out of your mouth right there.  Watch it.  I didn't bring any from the hotel.  I didn't know it was your own headphones.  No one gave Rich headphones.  We got to steal them from...  Well, then I apologize because all I saw was you going, I don't have headphones.  And I see all the headphone wires, but they're...  All right.  They were being used for something else.  This guy's giving me a compliment.  Oh, hi.  What happened?  He said that you...  Yeah, I was at your 1030 show Saturday night at Crackers.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  Only Opie and Anthony fan in the crowd. 
[00:48:00]  No, there was other ones, but thank you.  I'm calling Drew and A fans, and I'm screaming like a madman, and I look around, and yep,  I'm a adult.  I'm the only one.  You're the only one.  That's got to suck.  And the club ripped me off that week.  Why?  Oh, man.  Yeah, we did it.  You were killing, boss.  You were killing.  Thanks a lot.  Tell me about that stiff little chick that was sitting over in the corner that didn't  laugh at nothing.  It was crazy, man.  She was hard up.  I got such a bad email from somebody that said, you are the worst actor I've ever seen.  You're rude.  You're racial.  You're this and that. 
[00:48:30]  And in the club.  Bobby?  Oh, it wasn't from.  It was a memo on the fridge.  Come on, boss.  You killed, man.  Thanks for coming out, brother.  Yeah, boss kills on a comedy stage.  Thank you.  The radio thing, eh, it's a different story, and we like to beat him up.  Oh, what now?  We like to beat him up.  But let's not confuse the two.  When you hit the stage, he just kills.  Thank you.  I thought it was awesome the way he went right after the crowd.  I thought it was a great show.  Best show I've ever seen. 
[00:49:00]  How'd you get ripped off?  I had a door deal there, and then they go to pay me, and I found out Wednesday and Thursday  they gave 95 free comps, right?  And it was not in a contract.  You can't get free tickets.  What am I getting out of that?  Right, of course.  You know, and then the agent called, and they go, well, sue us.  So what am I going to do?  That's what they said, sue us?  Yeah.  What's the name of the club?  Crackers in Indianapolis.  Crackers in Indianapolis.  All right, for anyone that doesn't know, a door deal, a comedian works.  You're supposed to get a piece of the door, and that's what motivates you to go out and 
[00:49:30]  plug the stupid gig.  Yeah.  And they're going to, Crackers is going to say sue us, which means that they know something's  going on.  Complimentary tickets are always given out at standard, but on a door deal, you should approve  all comps.  You guys got to deal with so much crap.  When you tour the country as a comedian.  Crackers in Indianapolis.  It's unbelievable.  And yeah.  You got all these sleazy comedy owners all over the place.  There's a lot of great clubs.  Sure.  And they do the right thing.  But there's also a lot of clubs where there's sleazy owners, and they just take advantage  of the comedians when they come to town. 
[00:50:00]  You know, and then they go, well, you know, say it's seats 220.  You just know, slept.  Oh, we just slept.  20 seats or 570.  It's unbelievable that you have to almost count for yourself.  In the punchline in Atlanta, you want to have a good club?  I have a deal.  Like, you get bonus for sellouts.  I sold out two of the shows.  The third show was close, but didn't quite sell out.  And they gave me a bonus.  Anyway, they're like, ah, it was really close.  It's like they just did the right thing.  Yeah, of course.  They didn't have to do that.  What scumbags to sue us.  Speaking of which, let's go to Atlanta and say hi to Buddy.  Buddy, what's up?  Man, I saw Jimmy on Friday night, and he killed. 
[00:50:30]  They were putty in his hands.  No, very nice.  Putty in little Jimmy's hands.  I did a Frank the Frowner cartoon for him.  I'm going to be sending up.  Oh, I like that.  This guy, yeah, he's a good artist.  I like that.  Thank you very, very much.  By putty, he means P-U-D-D-Y.  No, it's great.  That's right, putty.  No, it's great.  Jimmy goes out there and does this comedy, and we get a nice feel for, you know, what's going  on with the Opie and Anthony audience in these cities.  Reconnaissance.  We're not even on a regular commercial radio station in Atlanta, and I heard that the shows 
[00:51:00]  were pretty much sold out across the board.  They were sold out because everybody's an O&A listener down here.  And I hear people coming from like 100 miles away just to see Jimmy Norton.  We do very well down there.  Absolutely.  Six shows, I would say.  Two were completely sold out.  One was almost sold out, and the three that weren't were close anyway.  What was the name of the place?  The Punchline.  Punchline, no.  Okay.  All right, thank you.  I just despise comedy club names.  Most of them are horrible.  Crackers.  That just, I am, I'm angry at that name. 
[00:51:30]  I don't care if they treated you like a king.  Yeah, but the good thing about Crackers is the audience draws what, you know, the name  is, you know.  Go Crackers.  Okay.  Sue us.  Better than the comedy club down the road, which ends the same, but yeah.  I opened up that way.  I go, sorry, sir.  You should be at.  Yeah.  Well, this week, this week I'm going to make a new CD at the club I'm at.  I'm taping a new CD in Philly, so.  Yeah, you're going to be at, Rich is going to be at the Helium Comedy Club tomorrow, Friday 
[00:52:00]  and Saturday, 215-496-9001.  It's a good gig, man, in Philly.  It's a good club.  But they're such nightmares.  Helium's a really good club in Philly.  All right, enough, Rich.  Yeah.  No one gives a crap.  We gave you your time.  Jesus.  But wait.  We got the, yeah, now get out of here.  You got your plug in.  I don't, I barely ever plug in.  That would be funny if that was your whole segment, though.  Right.  Trash crackers in Indianapolis because they ripped you off, and then you go home and go  to bed.  Yeah.  Done.  And then you're going to expect everyone else to plug the gig, like you leave the paper with 
[00:52:30]  Roland.  You're like, I had to plug, boys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Derek in Pittsburgh.  Blowing up in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Derek?  Hey, man.  I need to know if Paul R. Nelson won.  Derek lost.  You do know that he never had a chance, right?  I know.  Because we couldn't really, like, get behind half the stuff he believed in.  Well, I didn't know.  I didn't even give him a hand, anyhow.  We just thought it was fun because his ads were so awful. 
[00:53:00]  He received 11 votes.  Right.  Pretty much.  It was really like a blowout.  All right.  Hey, here's the rest of the election results.  There might be something interesting in here.  It's 30 seconds.  Let's go with it.  It was much closer in the Senate.  Republicans won in Tennessee, where Bob Corker defeated Democrat Harold Ford in a hotly  contested race.  But Democrats quickly captured four of the six seats they needed to take control in this  chamber.  That leaves two states, Montana and Virginia, where vote counts aren't yet over. 
[00:53:30]  In Montana, Democrat John Tester has a small lead over Republican Conrad Burns.  And in Virginia, Democrat Jim Webb has a razor-thin edge over Republican George Allen.  The votes are in and we won.  The point of the matter is, we're still counting votes.  All right.  Well, whatever.  Still counting.  Yeah, whatever.  Good luck to you.  Godspeed.  There was a hilarious story on the news when I first woke up.  Most of the people couldn't figure out how to use the new machines, and they were just 
[00:54:00]  throwing their hands in the air going, I don't know.  Old people.  And then machines weren't showing up, and it was just a mess.  Old people and savages, by the way.  They had some kind of-  That's who has trouble with the new technology.  They have a new voting machine.  It's like some kind of scanner.  Yeah.  And they just couldn't figure out how to use it, and there's a lady with like-  I don't know.  There's a lady with like a manual just like, I don't know.  This isn't how I elected Truman.  Yeah.  No, this was the lady that had to like set up the thing, and she had the manual going. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, wow.  Well, they're not quite brain surgeons either.  No.  See who works at a lot of those polling places?  Who?  I don't know.  They just don't seem like they're educated.  What do they look like?  I don't know.  They come in all sorts of shapes, sizes.  Oh.  All different shapes and sizes.  Yeah.  But not different than anything else, huh?  I don't know.  I see human beings.  Do you?  That's what I look at.  I see human beings, human beings, human beings. 
[00:55:00]  But to me, just to look for some reason, I go, that person doesn't look like they're qualified  to put that machine together.  They look dumb, basically.  It's a voting machine.  And what makes them look kind of dumb?  Just a look.  It's just a look, like this confused look, like Jimmy said, when they're going through  the manual, and they're looking.  And it's upside down.  There shouldn't be a manual, and it's upside down.  There shouldn't be a manual like that.  It just shouldn't.  When you go into the booth, are you upset there's no hole into another booth?  Why, Rich? 
[00:55:30]  We're doing election stuff.  This is responsible radio.  When they're putting it together and holding a wrench with their foot, that tells me that  there's a problem.  Let's say hi to Floyd.  Or if they build the booth, they put straw on the top and try to live in it?  All right.  All right.  You slip going into it on a...  Yeah, we understand, boss. 
[00:56:00]  Let's go to Floyd and things.  Hold on.  Ken Melman has the worst head I've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Who's Ken Melman?  Ken Melman.  You stink.  I think he's the head of the Republican National Committee.  It's the worst head I've ever seen.  Literally the head.  That includes John Merrick.  They've elected his head.  That head is...  They wouldn't decapitate him.  They'd worship him.  It's awful.  I should be on a stick in New Orleans.  First of all, no one knows where New Orleans is.  It's New Orleans. 
[00:56:30]  Why did you say...  I didn't get that.  In the Mardi Gras.  You know how they had the heads on the stick?  In the what?  In the Mardi Gras.  The heads on the stick.  Mardi Gras.  The Mardi Gras?  Hey, that's the Mardi Gras.  The Mardi Gras.  Hey, give me some calamari, some Mardi Gras.  What is Mardi Gras?  But he's great on a comedy stage.  Because I heard you earlier go, what do you mean about my radio?  I heard that.  My own in radio.  What is Mardi Gras?  He said, unfortunately, your own isn't a dictionary. 
[00:57:00]  What is Mardi Gras?  He almost said Matty.  Anyone else notice?  He almost said Matty Gras.  Rich, what is Mardi Gras?  They celebrate.  I don't know.  The festival.  How do you say it?  Mardi Gras.  How do you spell Mardi Gras?  M-A-D-R-I.  Mardi Gras?  Mother Gras?  How do you spell M-A-D-R-I?  Mardi Gras.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  M-A-D-R-I.  Mardi.  Wow.  Let's say I...  This is almost like a candid camera sketch.  Mardi.  Mardi Gras.  You're not a real person.  This couldn't be happening. 
[00:57:30]  He has children in high school.  I know.  This can't be happening.  Here we go.  All right.  Welcome to Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras.  Matari Gras.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Floyd in Vegas.  Floyd.  Floyd.  Hey, what's up?  I want to see if you guys went and checked out Borat over the weekend.  God, you talk like a Floyd, man.  You certainly do.  You did not disappoint.  We don't meet many Floyds, but, man. 
[00:58:00]  Well, I attempted to see Borat on Friday.  Yeah.  I went at 4 o'clock to my local theater for the 5 o'clock showing.  I figured early.  I figured I got an hour.  Maybe I'll even buy my tickets and go get a slice of pizza.  Yeah, you got time.  And I look on the big board and I see the sold-out shows.  Borat sold out 5 o'clock, sold out 7 o'clock, sold out 9 o'clock, sold out midnight.  Yep.  The next show was like they were showing like 2 in the morning. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  How about you throw this movie on a few screens for us?  I don't know what their strategy was.  But it worked.  It was a limited release, so they'd break all kinds of records, make a lot of money, which they did.  But they'd put it out on like, what, 800 screens?  Maybe there wasn't a demand for it.  Maybe the theaters wouldn't quit all this.  Yeah.  No, they're saying they would.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Now they would, but maybe they wouldn't win originally.  Hey, and a big plug to Break.com.  They took our Borat interview.  I guess Steve has a really good relationship with Break.com and a pretty good relationship 
[00:59:00]  with the YouTube guys.  I think we're interviewing them.  I threatened them.  Gurr.  But Break.com threw the first part of our Borat interview on the front page of Break.com  and it immediately got close to 300,000 views.  Oh, nice.  300,000 views.  Do you have a mustache shaved or no?  Huh?  Someone says a mustache was shaved.  I don't know.  I think it's a fake mustache.  I think he's got a really good fake mustache.  Oh, it was real?  It was real.  It looked real, man.  I don't know.  That kind of looked real.  Well, yeah, but it could be movie mustache. 
[00:59:30]  Movie mustaches look awful in real life.  Like in the movies, they usually look eh.  But in real life, you're like, oh.  Yeah.  Let me see someone on a set with like fake mustache or hair or makeup.  The Brady kids when they did it.  Right.  When Peter went out on the date with, what was his name?  Robert Reed.  Packer.  Fudge Packer.  Phil.  It was Phil Packer.  Ew. 
[01:00:00]  Phil Packer.  All right, listen.  I bet you Reed insisted on that last name.  Like, that's not, we want to go with Johnson.  Packer, I'm telling you.  No, Packer's good.  Something about it I just like.  Phil Packer.  Phil Packer.  Well, this is why I love America.  I mean, the elections were yesterday.  And, you know, Democrats take over the House for the first time in, what, 12 years?  Something like that.  You would think that would be the front page of the papers because it's a big news story. 
[01:00:30]  Sure is.  That's what I'm getting at.  God damn New York Post.  The half of the front page is Dem's clean house.  And the other half and the bigger half, how they laid it out.  Britney is getting a divorce.  Britney divorce.  Basically, it's Britney's front page with the Dem's clean house in the right bottom corner.  It should be.  But your eyes go right to Britney divorce if you're looking at the front page of the paper today.  So they're basically telling you that this is so much more important to us than the elections. 
[01:01:00]  Britney's divorce.  And they're so cute.  The headline, Britney divorce.  And then it says, FedEx bombshell.  Oh, oh, FedEx bombshell.  I've also seen Britney.  Fed up.  Fed.  Wait, how did they do it?  Fed up.  Did someone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they, no, they did something else with the, well, Fed up is too easy.  They can use Fed up.  Yeah.  And then you turn the page and it's, it's split knee for Britney. 
[01:01:30]  Dr. Seuss.  That is hot.  They have the worst.  Oh, that's what it was.  Britney is K fed up.  K fed up.  That's right.  That's what it was.  I'm quite jealous of his rap.  That guy's good, man.  I'm a K fed fan.  He's one of the best.  I want to go see him in concert.  One of the best in the, well, I don't think you're going to be able to.  They've canceled pretty much all of his shows for lack of enthusiasm.  Have they really?  Yeah.  Why can't we get an interview with K fed?  Where's Roland?  Yeah.  Let's get K fed on the phone.  I want to tell him to interview him. 
[01:02:00]  This guy's a good rapper.  He's keeping it real is what he's doing.  He is the biggest loser in the world, by the way.  Eminem stole from him.  The biggest loser.  This guy had it made.  Yeah.  He's just a white trash piece of crap.  All he had to do was like, if you want to do his.  Keep her happy.  Do his womanizing.  You know, you're going to sleep it under the rug a little bit.  Is it womanizing?  That's what they're starting to say.  Ah.  You know.  See?  He's got four kids.  He's going to get 10 million out of this, by the way. 
[01:02:30]  He gets 10 million.  You know, she had a prenup, but the prenup still gives him 10 mil.  He gets to be the last guy, too, that banged the hot Britney.  How do you bang Britney and then walk over with 10 million?  How unfair is that?  He gave her two kids.  That's all she wanted was kids.  He just wrecked her.  He just destroyed her.  And then she walks out on Letterman, and Ann and I were discussing this before the show.  That's the best she could possibly look, and she doesn't look that great.  They worked on her.  It's the absolute best she's going to look is right there. 
[01:03:00]  And you look at five years ago and tell me.  It's a whole different story.  Yeah.  Good for him.  He won the lotto.  Now he can produce a whole bunch of albums, Jimmy.  That no one will listen to.  Just think about it.  He checked into the St. Regis Hotel as...  Oh, no.  Forget it.  Forget it.  All right.  Okay, Finn.  Well, let's get some audio down here.  Roland, we want to promote his new CD. 
[01:03:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Paula.  Sorry.  Tell him we want to promote his new CD.  We want K-Fed.  We ain't getting K-Fed.  I want him to rap live.  That guy's good.  We're not getting K-Fed.  Why?  You don't rap when you hear it.  I do.  K-Fed.  I'm going to put a persona from K-Fed.  Roland, can we get K-Fed?  K-Fed.  What?  We don't care what he does.  Yeah, he can perform.  I don't get any crap.  I don't know.  We need security in between us, though, because I'll rush the stage because I'm a fan of K-Fed. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, Roland there.  What K-Fed?  YouTube is next week.  They're coming in studio.  They're going to come in studio, YouTube guys?  Yeah, they're nominated for Time Magazine, Inventors of the Year.  Invent.  What?  What are they nominated?  Inventors of the Year award.  Invaders.  Invaders of the Year?  Inventors.  Inventors.  Why do you talk like you've always just had oral surgery?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Invaders of the Year?  Okay.  Or?  Inventors. 
[01:04:30]  They invented a website that they put video on.  Is that really?  I mean, really.  Yeah.  Isn't it a crapshoot with websites?  Sure.  Like one just can catch on.  There have been other sites with video on it.  Yeah.  Why was all of a sudden YouTube the one that took off?  Why am I asking you?  I don't know.  I didn't assume you did for a second.  And where's your headphones?  None fit.  It's like when you get the big fat criminals and they have to use two sets of handcuffs 
[01:05:00]  to cuff his hands behind his back.  Yeah.  You actually need two sets of headphones stuck together to put around Roland's head.  All right, Roland.  It's very round.  We'll let you off the hook today.  That's how they named them.  We're too busy.  Here's K-Fed on Tyra last week talking about what Brittany calls him.  What does your wife call you?  Daddy.  She calls you Daddy?  She calls you Daddy.  No, I mean, usually we're, you know, baby this, baby that. 
[01:05:30]  Uh-huh.  You know, that lovely stuff.  And Daddy.  Daddy.  And what do you call her?  Meal ticket.  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty much.  That is the creepiest thing, too.  And that's big in the Spanish community.  That whole Mommy and Daddy thing.  No, they go Poppy.  But, yeah, whatever language it's in, it means Daddy.  If you're calling your girl Mommy or she's calling you Daddy, there is something so sick  in your mind.  Ugh.  Does anybody here, has anyone ever said Mommy? 
[01:06:00]  Well, did you guys hear the news that K-Fed was snubbed at his party?  She didn't show up for his party.  Oh, okay.  Now there's reason for the divorce.  No, I call my girl Mother when I'm having sex with her.  Mother?  Mother Blood!  I'll actually call her by my mother's maiden name.  I go with Granny myself.  Grandma.  Oh, Nana.  Nana. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, God damn.  It's even worse, though, if you only go from behind and you call her Pop-Pop.  Oh, Pop-Pop.  You make her wear a flannel shirt and a fedora, and the whole time you're doing it, she has  to go, faah, and flail her arms back at you.  Faah.  Get out of there, you.  Faah.  Faah.  Pop-Pop.  Give Pop-Pop a lesson of humility.  Hey, Gay Lost, by the way. 
[01:07:00]  What?  Uh, they're showing election results and Gay Lost.  Uh, no, uh, Gay Marriage?  Just Gay.  Gay Lost.  Oh, the name Gay?  I'm just saying Gay Lost.  You gotta be more specific.  No, it's funnier if you just say Gay Lost.  Gay Lost?  Yeah, he lost.  Oh, okay.  It is a guy named Gay, but he lost, so Gay Lost.  You can't win with that name.  Uh.  Gay.  Do you feel like you and Brittany are forever?  Uh, of course.  I mean, that's the love of my life.  When was this? 
[01:07:30]  I don't see myself as anybody else at all.  Um, you know.  Yeah, you go.  We work well together.  Yeah.  You know, we do.  For some reason, it just works.  It just works.  For some reason, it just works.  That really sounds like he's putting his all into this relationship.  I don't know why.  For some reason, bah, it just works.  Uh, watch him just completely fall apart now.  He is so done.  There's a stupid kid named Jaden James. 
[01:08:00]  That's a southern thing, Jimmy.  Jaden.  Is that a southern name?  I think so.  Is it?  I don't like it.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Um, when we get back, we'll get into some other things.  I think, I'm burping a lot today.  You're exploding.  I think Louis C.K. is stopping by today?  Nice.  Yes.  He's stopping in.  That's very cool.  He should be here next.  Also, uh, are some children's lyrics appropriate for children?  We could have some fun with this one today, I believe.  Some children's lyrics appropriate for children?  Why?  I don't even get the question.  And now that it's a new month, you know, we took a couple days off. 
[01:08:30]  Yes, we did.  Uh, we got line of the month stuff.  Ooh.  This is kind of fun every month.  Cold from line of the day.  Maybe we could try to do that next before we get Louis C.K. in here.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi, I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I gotta go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05. 
[01:09:00]  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, by the way.  It sucks here in New York today.  It's kind of a rainy day, but somewhere the sun is shining and girls are showing their boobs.  To get involved, all you have to do is get a WOW sticker on your car.  The WOW stands for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[01:09:30]  And there are plenty of women out there.  They see the WOW on the cars and the trucks, and they flash it.  Simple as that.  All we ask is that you don't harass the ladies, okay?  No.  All right, we got Rich Voss in studio.  He's playing Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia starting tomorrow night.  Yep, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  The Helium Club, it's a great club.  We saw it for the first time about a month, a month and a half ago.  It's a great place to do comedy.  I waited to do a new CD there.  It's just great.  Oh, you're doing the new CD at Helium?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, very nice.  Okay.  And then we've got to say hi to Louis C.K. here. 
[01:10:00]  Nice to meet you, guys.  Louis is back.  Good morning.  Good morning.  You're playing part of the Comedy Festival here in New York?  No, well, yeah, I'm doing a couple of shows here, and then I'm in Vegas next week for  the Vegas Comedy Festival.  We're on in Vegas, so there you go.  Are you going to be there?  I'm out there, too.  Are you?  What are you doing out there?  Me and David Teller are doing a show on Thursday night, the two of us, and then I'm doing Comic  Relief also.  Oh, nice, man.  It's Saturday.  Jesus.  Yeah.  This is just traveling minstrels.  I know.  You guys, you just wander the land, spreading laughter. 
[01:10:30]  I'm out there with our friend Saget.  I'm doing Bob Saget's show in Vegas with Jeff Ross.  Yeah, he's doing like a dirty show, right?  I know.  I get stuck on a late night show.  It starts at one in the morning.  I'm on last.  I'll be on at 2.45.  It's because you're foul.  Oh, I don't know the language.  That's all right.  They're all sober by that point.  I'm going to work totally clean.  Yeah, you should do it tonight.  All corny, awful political jokes.  Why not?  Yeah.  Well, your Comic Relief is live, right?  Isn't that live on HBO?  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  That should be great.  Yeah, it should be fun.  And they haven't done that in years now.  I think it took a few years off, yeah.  Took a few years off.  They had to find a new cause, I think.  Yeah, there weren't any more homeless people.  They fixed it.  Yeah, we fixed the homeless problem with the first one.  They realize people in general don't care about the homeless.  I earned that cake.  I earned that.  I earned that cake.  Like, why do you step on that?  That's why they're homeless, because nobody cares about them.  If anybody cares, they put them in a house.  The homeless don't even care.  No, they don't. 
[01:11:30]  You know, why help some of that doesn't care?  What was that catchphrase they had?  What?  They had, like, because it's not a laughing matter.  It was, no, no, no.  It was, here's some money, bum.  I remember, like.  There's always that line they have to cross, too.  Like, you know, if you walk into a store.  Yeah.  They say, either they say nothing, or they welcome you into the store.  Yep.  But there's bums that they walk in.  As soon as they walk in, they go, hey, get out of here.  Like, get out.  They don't let them in anywhere.  There's got to be a thin line in there somewhere where you just reach, you sleep outside two 
[01:12:00]  days in a row, and they start telling you, all right, take a walk.  You got to give them a little bit of time, though?  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because I can still, like, I can go to a hotel and, like, use the bathroom and even ask to  see a room, and they'll let me in there.  The latest.  White credibility, you know.  I can't, I can't, I feel guilty going into any place and using the bathroom without buying  anything.  What?  What?  I do.  Like, I feel like I'm going to get, not so much guilty.  Wrong word.  I feel like I'm going to get thrown out before I make it to the bathroom. 
[01:12:30]  Like, they take your poop and throw it out all the time.  Yeah, get out of here.  Take this with you, you bum.  Like, there's a lot of places say, no use to the bathroom unless you buy something kind  of thing.  It's like, you know, not a bum.  A place in New York, I went to the bathroom, I go, where's your bathroom?  And they go, it's a dollar.  And I thought he was joking.  And I came out, I had to pay the guy a dollar.  I'd rather have that, though, than speak around here.  I would do that in a second.  Yeah.  Like, they throw you out, and you know how usually in the movies, then the hat comes  afterwards, but your poop comes flying up.  Hits you in the head. 
[01:13:00]  And stay out.  Hey, I got a homeless guy that sleeps outside my place.  Yeah.  He's a black guy.  He sets up a mattress.  I don't know where the mattress goes during the day, but every morning when Kenny, oh,  that's not Kenny over there, Kenny picks me up.  Homeless guy, right outside my place, on a mattress, and he wears women's clothes.  Oh, yeah?  Black guy.  Black guy, women's clothes, homeless, outside my place every morning.  Is he passable, or does he look like a guy?  Oh, no.  It's just ridiculous.  I don't even...  Jimmy's thinking, why do you have this sex to get up? 
[01:13:30]  He comes with his own mattress.  I mean, my God.  I don't even think it has anything to do with his sexual orientation.  It's just clothes that he's found and said, what the hell?  Might as well just wear this.  These are warm.  Screw it.  That's the feeling I get from this guy.  What's the cause for comic relief?  Katrina.  Oh, it's really not homeless people anymore.  It's Katrina.  It's Katrina.  They're trying to do another Katrina.  You still need relief for that?  I thought that was all fixed.  They're giving the money to Houston.  It's a good cause. 
[01:14:00]  It's pro-Katrina.  It's like...  Oh, it's for it.  It's for re-flooding the city.  It's for doing another Katrina.  I get it.  They should throw their money to Houston for crime fighting.  They realize they need another flush.  Yeah.  One more flush should do the job.  Sledgehammers for the levies.  So, Louie, we're talking about, you know, Brittany getting the divorce.  We're talking about the elections.  We haven't talked about Doogie Howser coming out of the closet.  Is he gay?  That was a surprise.  Why did I ask that when he said Doogie came out of the closet?  What else could that mean? 
[01:14:30]  Well, it's a new term in Hollywood.  He's been lanced.  What?  That's what they're calling it.  Yeah, well, they...  When you're forced to come out of the closet, you've been lanced.  Yeah.  That has a couple of meanings, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could mean being lanced.  I had something lanced once.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, you get something poked into it and it leaks.  It's really accurate.  Yeah, exactly.  So, we got the Doogie coming out of the closet.  And now we got this great story in front of us from, what, Dublin? 
[01:15:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Doogie, quick question.  How was he lanced?  How was he forced out?  People started saying he was gay and so he said, yeah, I am.  Yeah.  Some people fight it.  Yeah.  Like Jim J. Bullock.  Yeah.  He fought it for years.  He's still fighting it.  He's still man, Anthony straight.  And Tom Cruise, of course.  Well, Tom Cruise.  He's putting up the good fight.  I mean, we don't know, obviously, but, you know, come on.  Something's going on there.  Yeah.  All right.  So, what about this story in front of you, Anthony? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Doctor saw it in a sex case.  Yeah.  Why not?  Is this one of those guys who just couldn't take it?  Where is this?  Dublin?  Dublin, Ireland?  I don't know if it's Dublin, Ireland.  Might be.  No, because they're mentioning San Francisco and Oakland in this story.  Dublin, Ohio.  Oakland, bitch.  Well, I said San Francisco and Oakland, so why would you say Ohio?  Oh, well, I mean.  I'm just blurting out to America.  Most people would assume if I said San Francisco and Oakland that there has to be a town called Dublin somewhere in that vicinity. 
[01:16:00]  It's in San Francisco.  Well, Rich has heard of Dublin, Ohio, which is in America.  That's just in his defense, it didn't pop in my head, too.  I just wasn't stupid.  He likes to show that he has some kind of knowledge.  You were smart enough to keep it to yourself.  I'm only a little smarter than him.  He likes to show people that he has some kind of knowledge.  It doesn't matter if it's not part of what we're currently discussing.  Why don't you just yell that pub in L.A.?  He could get laid off of having said Dublin, Ohio. 
[01:16:30]  Somebody might think, wow, that dude's really smart.  I thought you were saying.  Yeah, he's knowledgeable.  That's why I thought you said Dublin, Ireland.  I thought you were saying Dublin, Oakland or something.  You know, you're naming the cities where there's a Dublin or, you know what I'm saying?  All right, now I can't.  See, even Louis is trying too hard.  Louis is out.  Police searching for a Dublin doctor says they say sexually battered two men at his home  and took hundreds of photographs of 19 patients who were unconscious and undressed at his medical clinic. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Saucy.  Tony Hsu.  He ran a private practice.  So I guess out of his home?  Is that what's going on here?  Out of his home.  Well, you could see this kind of a Dr. Tony Hsu.  Some Asian gentleman.  Um, ran a private practice.  Wait till the patient's unconscious.  Yeah.  Take their clothes off and photograph them.  Well, maybe they just, uh, voluntarily. 
[01:17:30]  Maybe that was part of whatever procedure they were getting done.  Allegedly drugged two men at his Dublin residence in August and then raped one of them, Dublin  a police sergeant, uh, said.  A search of his home turned up 450 photos of 19 male patients who were unconscious and  semi-nude in, uh, medical room examination, uh, rooms, sorry, medical examination rooms.  The doctor came under suspicion after two alleged victims reported to police that Hsu had drugged  them as they visited his home. 
[01:18:00]  Uh, one of the men had known Hsu for years.  The other met him that night.  How awful is that when your doctor rapes you?  That's gotta just be a horrible...  What do you turn to?  Well...  Got the rape kit right there.  You gotta go back to him to stitch you up?  No, I went to get some dental work done and they knocked me out and I woke up with a sore  throat and I was really certain that somebody did me in the mouth.  Really?  I was sleeping.  But I, the way I look at it is if you have people come into your office and you're knocking  them out, how do you not at least lick their face? 
[01:18:30]  How do you not give them the finger right to their face, lick their face?  Something.  Yeah, yeah, something.  We, we were talking about how doctors are just, they're just people.  They're guys, they, they get a little worked up.  And if you're a dentist and this beautiful woman comes in and now she's completely knocked  out, you're alone in there.  We call it the perv switch.  The perv switch.  Everyone has it.  Everyone has it.  And some people get turned on. 
[01:19:00]  It makes people pervs.  Opportunity does.  You're just sitting there with your little pick going, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I've got  cuspid problem here.  We're just gonna, I've got to see those cans!  Yeah, I got it.  It's like, ah!  You just lose your mind and then rip her shirt open.  And you gotta fondle.  And you just, yeah.  You just lose everything.  Yeah.  Yeah, you start laughing at her boobs and.  She's, uh, she's unconscious.  Yes, we've got, uh, the number eight, uh, molar on the top.  I'm seeing the, oh, gosh!  I gotta grab her crotch. 
[01:19:30]  I just have, click.  She's unconscious right in front of you.  Of course.  And then you.  Just breathing heavy and her boobs are just rising.  Yeah, yeah.  They're heaving.  And you're just trying to control yourself.  I think that's how most men would use any superpower, you know?  That's how we use anything.  Yeah, that's about as close to a superpower as you can get.  Yes, it is.  You are a knockout man.  You can just, they come to you with the total knowledge that you will knock them unconscious.  Uh, and that's it.  You just gotta make sure you button the shirt, right? 
[01:20:00]  You ever button your shirt and it's uneven at the bottom and you go, oh, what about I do?  You gotta make sure you don't do that to her.  They always fumble and put it, they put both breasts back in the same bra holster.  Yeah.  They just fumble nervously.  There's always a screw up.  You gotta put it back quickly before she wakes up.  I woke up feeling like something had happened.  I felt like dirtier in some way.  And then I realized my bra was on where my panties belong and vice versa.  I had tapioca in my hair.  When you're getting knocked out, if you're a woman, if you're getting knocked out by  the dentist, you should write, you know, you pig on your boob. 
[01:20:30]  Or I have AIDS.  Yeah.  Welcome to the world of AIDS.  Like you can get AIDS from looking at a sleeping woman's boob.  That would freak you out though if she had a message for you.  Yeah, exactly.  But you say, what do you draw the line?  How about the guy that works, you know, at the funeral home who's in the room by himself  all the time, you know.  Well, that guy too.  That guy happened too.  That guy too.  How do you not?  How do you not?  It depends on how fresh it is, I think.  Yeah.  And how they died.  That's right.  If it was a bad fire, you might want to let that one go. 
[01:21:00]  I love how Jimmy says might.  You might want to.  Yeah, but then again, it's.  Then again, you know.  A lot of sex is curiosity.  A lot of sexual lurch.  How many, you know, boobs that have been on fire have you seen?  Sure.  What would it be like to have sex with beef jerky?  Yeah, exactly.  There was a.  Well, that's easy to find out.  A few guys decided they saw a woman's obit in the paper and she was attractive.  They found her grave.  Yeah.  We're in the midst of digging up her grave. 
[01:21:30]  One guy wanted to have sex with this dead woman.  So he gets two of his friends.  Right.  Who weren't going to have.  His don't be friends.  That was, come on.  Yeah.  Come on.  They were going to dig her up so he could take her home and have sex with her.  Wow.  Based on the picture in the obituary.  And then the host from Dateline walked out.  What are you doing here?  Are you going to have sex?  Oh, I was just going to dig her up and hang out with her.  Having sex with a corpse.  Why would you want to do that?  I mean, I'm a pervert.  Why would you want to do that?  Those are good friends. 
[01:22:00]  That's.  Yeah.  No kidding.  That's the word.  All right.  Look, dude, I understand.  Sure.  Yeah, I get you.  You know, she is hot.  I'm not going to join you.  I understand she's your chick, dude.  You know, bros before dead homes.  I'll do the digging and you can.  It's tough to talk your friends into moving a couch when you.  Yeah.  How the hell do they talk these guys into, you know, I want to dig up a chick because  I want to have sex with her.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Like, is there a point where you go, like, are they going to go for this? 
[01:22:30]  Like, you got to really know your friends.  Yes.  You had to have been through some other stuff.  You don't just work yourself.  You don't go right from, hey, you know, you want to go out, drink a few beers to dig up  this dead chick so I could have sex with her.  And her friends go, is she having an orgasm or decomposing?  How do you break that to your friends?  Like, do you say it as a joke?  And like, as you're all laughing.  And then you start going, but seriously, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you're not laughing.  You're staring over your beer.  Well, they must have history.  With shovels.  They must have history. 
[01:23:00]  Like, well, come on.  Remember the time I helped you drink that homeless guy's urine?  Yeah.  There's got to be something in their history.  All of them.  I helped you wipe that kid's blood off your bumper.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You're right.  Dude, a hair, and you would have been caught on that bumper.  And we helped you clean the whole thing up.  All right.  We said I didn't want to have an orgy.  You know how much digging that would have been that night?  Oh.  Hey, let's go to Kelly in Syracuse.  Kelly.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Kelly.  Hi.  I had a friend that when she was younger, she was molested by her older brother. 
[01:23:30]  And so she was going to a shrink in order to get help with that.  And her shrink was molesting her.  Well, wait.  How old was she that he was molesting?  Was she an adult or was she a kid?  She was a teenager when the shrink was.  He was hypnotizing her and then molesting her.  Well, her brother did a shrink.  What was she wearing?  I mean, you know, sometimes they bring it on themselves.  By the way, they carry them themselves and walk around. 
[01:24:00]  Kelly, you're not going to find sympathy here.  You realize how hot that sounds, right?  I know.  Well, again, why be a shrink if you're not going to molest the vulnerable?  Why hypnotize a woman if you can't convince her to?  Why hypnotize a woman?  That's the whole point of hypnotizing anyone is that they're a woman and you're going to touch their bodies with your penis.  That's the entire point of the exercise.  So what ended up happening there, Kelly?  I think they just ended up being a lawsuit, but I figured you guys would find that pretty hot that she actually got molested.  You throw away the coin and just swing a bag in front of her face? 
[01:24:30]  You're getting sleepy.  How did he get caught?  He ended up, he was molesting quite a few of his patients, actually.  Yeah.  It turned out that he was molesting quite a few of his patients.  But they were kids, though, or like 19-year-olds?  It sounds like she was a grown-up.  They were like 13, 14.  Oh.  Oh, well, now I recant everything else.  Unacceptable.  All right, let's go to Matt.  He's a dentist in Georgia. 
[01:25:00]  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You know, I just have to, I'm on the way to work listening to you and just brought back memories for just a second of this past summer when it's really hot outside.  These, I don't know, these cheerleaders, they come in with these midriff T-shirts.  Oh, my gosh.  And she's these frickin' gym shorts, and she's laying back in the chair.  Yeah.  And I lay her back, and you know how they're, I don't know, their hip bones, when they're skinny as hell, their pants kind of come up. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, they kind of ride on top, and you can see right down there.  Oh, my God.  And I'm laying there, and Mom's in the room with me.  Good thing.  She's 17 years old.  Who, Mom?  Oh, no, no.  Oh.  No.  Mom is nowhere near.  But, you know how the dieties ride up.  Doesn't Mom know, though, when she's got a hot daughter like that, doesn't she look at you when the kids are sleeping and go, go ahead, man, I know.  Go ahead.  She's sitting there daring me to, and I mean, I, you know, and I'm working, I'm kind of halfway looking down, and I look down, and her eyes are looking straight at me. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  You're thinking of a whole different root canal.  Wait, wait, wait.  You know what dentist is up to something?  When they come in for a cavity, and he pulls all her teeth.  Watch it out, guys.  Wait, wait, dude.  Who was looking at you, the girl or the mother?  Well, no.  The girl was looking at me.  The mom was sitting in the corner of the room.  So you're taking peeks as you do your work there? 
[01:26:30]  It's impossible.  I mean, you're laying them back.  They're laying essentially in your lap, and a lot of these ladies, they come in with low-cut blouses on.  Yeah, but, see, you said in the summer in their cheerleading outfits.  They don't wear outfits, cheerleading outfits.  That was your fantasy, right?  This guy's got a pervert switch this year.  Oh, yeah.  It's very close to the surface.  We all do, though.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Let's say hi to Dane Cook.  Dane!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, have you ever been molested?  No, but those are some great stories. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, got to watch the dentist.  We were talking about the perv switch.  Everyone has one.  You know, you get these stories in the paper where the dentist is molesting the patients when they're under.  My feeling on molestation is that, like, right around third or fourth grade, like, it should just be mandatory.  You're molested.  And that way, everybody will have dealt with it.  Everybody's got a fair deal.  We've all been diddled somewhere or another, and we can all say, you know what?  I know the feeling.  Let's just move on.  We got it. 
[01:27:30]  Even fat kids?  No.  Fat kids should not be molested.  Just they have to go to therapy and cry about how nobody touched them.  One more humiliation.  You got to think there were people growing up that wished they were molested, and no one paid attention to them.  That wish?  No one paid attention to them.  I don't think there'd be a wish.  Daddy, I'm going to take a shower now.  Don't bug me.  Doing everything you can, and no attention's being paid.  I can't get the water temperature right.  Could you help me? 
[01:28:00]  Ask your mother.  Oh, man.  Damn.  When I was a kid, my grandmother goes, what makes you so funny?  And I go, a small penis.  And my grandfather goes, no, you don't have a small penis, but your brother does, right?  Oh, yeah, you got a laugh from Dane.  Yeah, you got a little.  I think that was the courtesy laugh from Dane.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm selling out the garden.  Yeah, Dane, what's up, man?  Selling out the garden.  What are you doing?  I know.  I'm, like, thinking about adding a third show.  Are you kidding? 
[01:28:30]  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm not kidding.  All right.  Jesus.  Because you got a lot of people jealous to begin with.  The garden show sold out in a day, so you added a second day?  Yeah, yeah.  We added a second show.  I think there, I don't know how many seats are left, but there's a few.  There's a few, like, there's, like, 2,000 or 3,000 seats left.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  It's only the garden.  It's pretty loony.  And how many movies are you in in the next month?  I'm finishing my, this will be my fourth one in a row that I'm finishing now. 
[01:29:00]  Jesus Christ.  I'm here in Rhode Island with Steve Carell.  Jesus.  And what's this film about?  It's called Dan in Real Life.  Me and Steve are brothers, and we come home for a family reunion.  He's a widower who falls in love with this girl that he meets at a bookstore, but he doesn't know she's my girlfriend.  So when he finally comes home for the reunion, there's a little love triangle going on because we're both trying to keep the girl close to our hearts. 
[01:29:30]  Are you like the dick in this whole one?  No.  And he's the nice guy, and he'll wind up getting the girl, even though the girl would run off with you first?  No, we're both, that's the thing, is it's kind of like one of those things, you don't know who she should be with because we're both nice guys who end up kind of having to outdo one another.  She goes to the dentist and gets molested.  This is a hard pitch.  This sounds like a great movie right now, doesn't it? 
[01:30:00]  This is a real panel one, isn't it?  This is a good one.  This is the one that you decided you were going to go for something a little different.  There are puppets in this one.  Puppets?  Hey, what was the Kevin Costner flick you did?  Mr. Brooks, yeah, that comes out, I think, in March.  That's like a, I guess it's kind of like a Seven or a Silence of the Lambs.  He plays a serial killer called the Thumbprint Killer.  He only kills couples while they're doing it. 
[01:30:30]  And I play this guy who, I'm like this deviant nobody who takes pictures of him while he's doing it.  And then I blackmail him into teaching me how to be a serial killer or I'll expose him.  Doesn't he know you're taking pictures of him?  That would take a serial killer off when the flash is going off while you're murdering someone.  No, I catch it.  He doesn't know that he left a curtain open in a hotel and I'm across the street.  I was taking pictures of a couple while they were doing it.  So he got caught because he screwed up. 
[01:31:00]  The darker side of Dane Cook now coming out in these movies.  He is.  I like this, see?  You don't want to be typecast as the goofy guy in the movie.  So now you're starting to take on these other roles.  He's a smart move.  Eddie Murphy should have played a rapist or something completely out of character.  But Murphy would never do anything like that.  I'm like, why doesn't he one time do something that is completely unexpected and he never did it?  It's always the fun, happy.  Yeah.  I'm sure Murphy wants to take career tips from you.  Look, I'm not saying that I have a lot of movies. 
[01:31:30]  But I'm saying that Eddie Murphy...  You have none.  Kind of.  Yeah, that's a way to phrase it.  Let's get a line.  All right.  I tried to sugarcoat it.  You actually had a number prepared.  Are you at some point...  So, Jimmy, are you at some point going to play a human being?  How are you going to diversify your...  Mix it up a little bit.  I'm going to play a faithful guy who actually looks in the eyes of the person he's sleeping  with.  Right.  All right, Dave.  Beverly Hills Cop was actually on the other night.  Yeah.  And I never noticed... 
[01:32:00]  And I always loved Beverly Hills Cop.  But you notice how many times Eddie does his Eddie laugh in Beverly Hills Cop?  Oh, yeah.  Constant.  It's insane.  It's every other line.  He's like, yeah, there you go.  It's every other line.  Yeah, two guys walking down the sidewalk.  He had to turn around, look, and give the laugh.  Like, there wasn't enough laughs in the movie.  Hey, Dane, what's it like being in the business when you don't have to try to get to the next  level anymore?  Like, when you're...  Good question.  Huh?  You know, when there's no more struggle, what's it like?  What Rich is saying is, what's it finally like to make the jump from middle to headline? 
[01:32:30]  Rich, just ask.  Don't be ashamed of yourself.  Co-middle.  Yeah, what's next for Dane Cook?  Oh, man, you know, that's the weird thing.  Once you want...  You know, this last year, it's just been so fast, man.  Everything for so many years was about scraping, you know?  It was like, all right, what do I got to do?  What do I got to do?  And then to have all these things having taken place, it's just kind of...  Yeah, it's kind of weird.  Here's what Dane's career is. 
[01:33:00]  You know what it is?  Steve Martin.  It's Steve Martin.  You shoot to this unbelievable height of fame with your comedy, and then you go into  acting, and then at some point you'll turn into a completely white-haired ass.  Yeah.  And you'll do Pink Panther.  Yeah, and do Pink Panther movies.  Yeah, if you see Steve Martin out there, do me a favor and just lop his head off for  doing that, and just yell, Peter Sellers, as you're hacking through his stupid neck.  But now he's got to be like, nah, but the guy's great. 
[01:33:30]  I think Dane doesn't want to say anything bad about anyone in Hollywood.  You're a smart man, Dane.  Oh, man.  Don't burn those bridges.  Got a few bridge burners here.  All right, so Dane, you're playing The Garden on Sunday.  Tickets through Ticketmaster.com, right?  Yes, yes.  This Sunday night, two shows at The Garden.  Two shows at The Garden.  Very nice.  All right, Dane.  And there's rumors, though, that people are saying that Dane was going to stop by the 
[01:34:00]  Hammerstein Ballroom on Friday night and do a spot on my show.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that'd be nice.  That might have been good if I could sit without a bubble of fruit bubble in my throat.  That was your big opportunity to get a nice rumor start, Jimmy.  No, he won't do that.  I can't even start that because the rest of my tickets will sell immediately.  It'll be all hot chicks who vomit when I walk out and realize it's not true and they  can't leave.  I can't have that rumor started because they'll leave immediately when they realize that after  Nathaniel, it's me.  Well, you've got Artie on the show.  There's going to be hot chicks there for Artie.  How many? 
[01:34:30]  Artie Foucault.  I don't know how he does it.  All he does is have hot chicks.  It's disgusting.  It's disgusting.  That's how he does it.  Twelve inches.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Artie's a legend.  All right.  You mean his penis?  Yeah.  Why did I answer yeah?  I actually answered yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dope I am.  Yes, sir.  I don't think you're...  I think you're selling yourself short, man.  I think women dig you.  That a boy, Lou.  Thanks.  Nice work, Lou.  All right.  Dane, thank you so much.  Anytime, fellas.  You know it.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:35:00]  And by the way, did you...  I was talking to Bobby and he was saying something about...  Like, did you guys call my publicist or was there like some kind of mishap?  I don't want you guys...  Because Bobby was saying you guys were trying to get in touch with me.  I was like, they can get me on MySpace before they can get me through a publicist.  Oh, really?  No, I think we...  Bobby is an ass.  Yeah, Bobby's just...  Bobby's just a pontificating dope.  He's probably like, Dad, they tried to call you, Dad.  Bob is just so happy that you pick up the phone when he calls now because he's finished  and he knows it. 
[01:35:30]  Bob Kelly is done.  They got the varnish on him.  Oh, he is absolutely finished.  You know how annoyed I was having to hear Bob feel good about himself this year?  Dad, the ticket count, shut up!  Don't talk to me like you're a famous guy, Bob.  You guys can't be happy for anyone.  I'm happy for people.  I can be happy for people.  But you just don't want to be happy when it comes to Bob Kelly?  Who are you happy for?  Yeah, right. 
[01:36:00]  Happy for...  Exactly.  Why would I be happy for you, Vos?  I'm happy for you.  I'm sad for Bonnie.  But that's what Bob...  But Bob this year was insufferable.  Talking about his own ticket counts.  Dane's on his second garden show.  And if he's calling in a plug-a-gig, that's your second garden show.  Stupid Bob complaining about...  I wanted to bite Bob's fat Donald Pleasant's face for about nine months now.  Why did you give him a shot?  Bobby's been struggling and finally he had a good year. 
[01:36:30]  What's wrong with that?  I stick up for Bobby.  He finally had a good year.  Yeah, I like Bob Kelly.  He's happy for that.  Why wouldn't you want to support Bobby?  You know it's going to pass.  He's down to 13 minutes.  But he had a good year.  I support Bobby.  And I think Bobby...  Wouldn't it be up to 13 minutes if you're going for the 15 minutes of the same thing?  Oh, you know, I'll keep it technical.  You know the joke.  Well, you ruined the joke, though, because you said it's down to 13 minutes.  That means only two minutes of his 15 has been spent.  That's right.  We have 13 more minutes for that jacket.  Dave, you know, Dave. 
[01:37:00]  You stupid hands opening.  How did you tolerate him on a bus?  I like Bob Kelly.  He's one of those guys where I really like him.  And I'm talking.  I'm like, what a great guy.  And then he says something unbelievably stupid.  Oh, yeah.  Punch him directly in his face.  You don't know where on Bob's face you want to hit him.  It's like the nose is obvious, but his eyes are punchable.  His cheeks are punchable.  When I first got to know him, I said, where are you from?  And he said, I lived in Medford, Massachusetts.  Actually, I lived in East and South Medford. 
[01:37:30]  Like, nobody cares if you came from two parts of some town that nobody ever heard of.  Like, we're all supposed to go, wow, did you make all new friends?  Did you see snow for the first time?  Your dad must have been in the Army.  That's amazing if you're South.  Just say you're from Medford, you fat piece of garbage.  And I just met him, and I liked him.  But I'm already swearing in his stupid face.  And the honest question would be, all right, well, why did the one-step family reject you  and send you to people they knew?  What had you done? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, to go from the Southeast.  You'll take him.  Just please, no more helping Bob Kelly.  That's my only request.  I love Bobby because he goes from, like, calm to tirade in, like, three seconds about anything.  He could get, like, the wrong flavor ice cream, and it's a six-and-a-half-hour dissertation,  loud, with spit.  Dude!  Dude!  But he'll eat it.  Yeah, dude!  I want rim raisin, dude!  Here's how dumb.  This is why I tell you Bob is stupid because we were talking one time about John Travolta 
[01:38:30]  and about him, like, having planes.  And someone was saying that Travolta had planes, like, way years ago.  And Bob goes, nah, dude, it's ever since this whole new thing after Pulp Fiction.  And someone's like, no, no, no, he had them before.  And the guy goes, and Bob's like, nah, dude, I'm telling you, it's brand new.  And the guy's like, I just saw a special on Travolta.  He had them.  And then Bob's like, all right, dude.  It's like, he's just a pontificating fool.  He's a fool.  I love Bob, and I just realized that's what he is. 
[01:39:00]  He's a fool.  Fool.  Leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  I'm pro-Bob Kelly this month because he called me upset.  Hold on.  What, Voss?  He called me upset the other day, and I'm pro-Bob Kelly.  I'm campaigning for Bob Kelly, and I hope his fame stays.  Did you give him advice?  No, I can't give anybody advice.  Bob's fame.  He should have Challenger written on his shirt.  All right, we've got to let Dane go.  Dane's got interviews to do here.  Dane, Sunday at the Garden, second show, Ticketmaster.com. 
[01:39:30]  That's it.  All right, thank you, Dane.  All right, Dane.  Shame, man.  All right, guys.  Dane Cook, everyone.  We've got to take a quick break.  We're really late.  We've got Louis C.K. here, Rich Voss here.  We'll continue.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.

It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:40:30]  Welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony Radio program here on 92.3.  Hey.  No.  And also other places.  All right.  Good.  Plenty of places.  And Rich Voss, Louis C.K. hanging out today.  And Louis just told me, Louis shot an HBO special, man, and he's shown in January, an hour.  Wow.  Which is, I'm very, very happy for you as slash jealous.  So Louis shot an hour, and we'll be on time early. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  A lot of jealousy.  But I'm happy for Louis.  I'm very happy for Louis.  Of course.  Maybe Louis does what I'm happy for.  Well, I gave you a job.  You certainly did.  I thought about depressing.  Pamela just called me.  She got my sweater back.  The rich sweater from Lucky Louis had been sold off.  Yeah, that's right.  Because they sell your assets immediately.  It's like a divorce.  Yeah, no.  We had to get all our clothes.  And Pamela bought my sweater.  I got my sweater for myself.  That's right.  I can wear that like now when prostitutes come over.  I can hope they recognize me.  I can go, what?  Because I'm nude in my sweater. 
[01:41:30]  Memba.  Memba.  What do they do with it?  They just sell it to people who will use it for whatever.  Like homeless?  Or other.  So there's a company called It's a Wrap.  Yeah.  And they just buy everything that a TV show, a dead TV show had.  Oh, It's a Wrap.  It's a Wrap.  Yeah.  And then what do they do with it?  They liquidate it.  I don't know what they would have gotten for that sweater, you know.  But do they sell it?  If there's any iconic stuff, they would put it on eBay and stuff like that.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah.  Do they sell it to fans and stuff?  Yeah.  So I took all my work shirts and that stuff, yeah.  I got to tell you guys, wherever I go, man, I was in Rochester for a few days and a lot 
[01:42:00]  of Lucky Louie fans up there.  And people you would never expect, like, you know, proper women that don't have a dirty  mind.  And I'm like, what?  That's the weird thing.  It's mostly older people.  There's always older, in New York, every corner I'm waiting for a red light, some older  Jewish woman puts her hand on my chest kind of sexually and says, you are wonderful, like  old Jewish ladies and old black couples, well-dressed, come up to me and say they love  the show and then take my wallet and stuff. 
[01:42:30]  I didn't think that was the problem.  You just needed white people.  I didn't expect a lot of white people to enjoy the show.  There's more white people in America.  I didn't expect the soccer moms.  No?  Yeah.  I just didn't.  And that's what I see a lot.  They come up and go, oh, that show is so honest and the language, it was real.  Well, when I started doing material about having a family on stage, I thought I was  going to get booed for the stuff I was going to say because I did it out of frustration.  I didn't think it would make me successful.  I was going on stage and saying stuff like, now that I have a baby, I understand babies  in the garbage. 
[01:43:00]  I wouldn't do it, but for the first time, I get it.  I totally visualize it.  And it's true.  Every parent, actually, your head goes to like, okay, who would know?  How many people have seen this baby?  I'm like, oh, yeah, they got her footprint at the hospital.  I forget it now.  It's not going to.  Can I explain it away?  They're going to come around.  Hey, what happened?  What?  We didn't have a baby.  What are you talking about?  But so I would do jokes about that, and I thought I'd just get booed, and I was just  doing it for my own.  And soccer moms would come up to me after shows. 
[01:43:30]  Sure.  And say, thank you for doing this stuff.  Thank you.  I did kill my baby.  I threw my baby in the garbage.  I didn't realize how funny it is that I did that.  Louie, what's the most frustrating thing about being a parent?  I think it's the spouse.  I think if I was alone, I'd be fine.  Alone with a kid?  Yeah.  Seriously.  I got two.  And I can think, I sort of think in my head, because you do with a virtual reality, okay,  my wife dies, and the kids are still around, you know, to get a nanny. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, I could do it.  Wait till your kid turns 16 and stays out all night drinking and lies at 16.  Oh, boy.  The only thing I'll do better is if I dropped her off.  All night long, going from party to party.  Is that what's happening with the hot boss daughter?  Yeah, no, I haven't had any.  I haven't started.  That's a whole new level where the person actually has a life that you have to worry about.  Right.  And to me, I have two girls, so I just don't want them to depend on guys.  That's all.  I really don't care if they're hookers, as long as, I guess that is depending on guys. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  In a big way.  Hookers are not really independent of spirit.  No.  But, no, the hard part is, when they're babies, it's that you don't sleep, and you really get  on edge, and you want to kill people.  Yeah.  And, but I don't, there's endless reservoir of energy for the kids.  I mean, they're crappy people.  They don't care about you.  It's a one-way relationship.  They're mean-spirited.  They smell bad, too.  Other times, like, my daughter won't bathe, and we have a baby, so we can't force her anymore. 
[01:45:00]  Like, we just go, fine, just sleep in your clothes.  Nobody cares anymore.  But she starts to stink.  Like, she's got this little girl vagina smell that is kind of really, it's really hard  to take.  It's really hard.  It's disgusting.  Do you have an Arab kid?  What's that?  Well, if any kid, you don't wash them.  They stink.  The reality is there's not much joy, right, when they're young?  Well, but there is.  There's enough that it does make all that worse.  It doesn't bother me.  Like, she'll be really rude to me, and I just, I think it's funny, and I'm proud of her. 
[01:45:30]  I want her to be rude and self-expressive.  I want her to take from people and crap on them and abuse them.  Because that's how you get ahead in the world.  I can never understand when I see a father with especially daughter, young daughters in  a store or anywhere, and they go into that baby talk thing, and it's like, Jesus Christ,  this is a grown man who is now, you know, he was probably into, you know, he was under 
[01:46:00]  the hood of his car turning a wrench at some point with his buddies drinking beers, and  now he's gooby baby talk, no, no, baby, no, darling, we can't do that, no, no.  And you just look and go, what happened to you?  Yeah.  No, I don't talk to my daughters that way.  No?  No.  I just talk to them like, because that's stupid.  It's retarded.  It really is.  Your kid talks like a baby, because your kid is stupid, and your kid doesn't know how  to make real words yet.  Your kid sucks at talking.  So you're going to teach them by talking like them? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  How dumb is that?  Like, parents that take their kid's words, do you want Mickey, milky, Mickey, Mickey?  Say milk.  So the kid learns how to say milk, so they can get a job.  Don't retard their verbal development by talking like them.  The only people you should just baby talk on are the elderly.  Yeah, exactly.  Just to humiliate them.  Well, there was a little kid in my neighbor, a little black kid, and his uncle, you remember  Froggy from Courageous Cat to talk like that?  No.  The uncle. 
[01:47:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, hold on.  You're not just kidding.  Was that a talkie?  Did you just make up that cartoon?  No, Courageous Cat.  You remember Courageous Cat?  No.  I'm going to tell you a good story.  I don't remember Froggy.  You watched cartoons when they were in black and white, didn't you?  Steamboat Willie?  Jesus.  Was that on a flip card thing like those?  Yeah.  It was a flip book.  He put a penny in the Nickelodeon thing and cranked it.  Turned his cap on backwards.  I go to Coney Island.  How old are you? 
[01:47:30]  Are you serious?  You don't know Courageous Cat in minutes.  I remember the name, yes.  Yeah, I don't remember ever watching it.  But not Froggy, Rich.  He was one of the characters.  He was one of the criminals.  And how did he sound?  He went, ah, see, man.  Ah, see.  Like Muggsy, you know.  Muggsy.  Yeah, that was the...  Oh, my God.  You know, if I close my eyes.  Yeah.  Froggy.  Froggy.  He'd have a cigar in his mouth.  A little cigar.  Ah, see, man.  Yeah, I think Pixar is doing a Froggy movie.  Yeah, he's such a popular character.  Why am I being attacked from a show I watch? 
[01:48:00]  I'll tell you why you're being attacked.  Tell Louie what that event in New Orleans is.  Mardi Gras.  How do you spell it?  M-A-R-D-I-G-R-A.  Mardi Gras.  You finally...  All right, look.  He looked the word up during the break.  He looked it up.  What did I say before?  He said Mardi Gras and Madry Gras.  No.  And he spelled it M-A-D-R-I.  Oh, you're out of your mind.  I said M-A-R-D-I.  No, you didn't.  Oh, my...  You don't think you tape this show every day?  I know you do.  It's on tape, my friend.  It's on tape.  How much do you want to bet?  I said I'll take bets right now. 
[01:48:30]  How much do you want to bet?  You spelled it M-A-D-R-I.  I'll bet you.  I got a hundred right now.  No, I can't gamble because I could gamble.  Oh, that's right.  M-A-R-D-I.  Oh, you're lucky.  Come on.  That is the easiest money I would make.  It's gambling.  You can stop in a second.  No, I can't.  Come on.  You said Mardi Gras, and we asked you, and you said Madry Gras.  Madry.  Can you imagine if that's how you tumbled back down because of that bet?  Just one bet.  You just said...  Back to smoking crack.  I was sure I said Mardi, and I lost the bet, and I had to go make up for it at the OTB.  And Bonnie left me three months later. 
[01:49:00]  It would take a week for Voss to be on his knees pleasuring someone for a vial.  I don't know because of a word he misspelled.  Because he misspelled a word.  People are saying here, it's the Froggy tool.  Froggy was from our gang.  A frog or froggy, whatever.  If you talk to him in froggy tool, if you talk to him in past tense, it was froggy.  All right, so let's get to your story.  Well, it doesn't matter.  This is how old this cartoon was.  The character was just called The Frog.  The first frog ever on a cartoon. 
[01:49:30]  It wasn't Kermit the Frog or Froggy.  No.  Just The Frog.  The Frog.  And people were fascinated by it back then.  A frog who speaks.  It's a frog.  How do they do it?  All right, so what happened with The Frog?  What happened?  We're talking about kids and how you talk baby talk.  It sounded good.  The kid, the uncle.  As the Doughboys were headed to Europe, Froggy makes the movies green.  Yeah, see?  The uncle would talk to the kid in that voice, the little kid, and the kid grew up. 
[01:50:00]  He would talk regular and then break into that voice.  Like Froggy.  Yeah, but not know it.  That's how he really talked.  He would go from talking like a real person into Froggy.  Jesus, God, please let this story have an ending.  What?  Please, I'm praying.  Please, God, let it see.  Have some kind of ending, see?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Pray just cat.  Hop.  Nah.  Hop.  And then this kid grew up and he bought a club in Philly called Helium. 
[01:50:30]  No, I don't know.  You tased Rich.  I sure did.  That Frog story.  It could be the, I've heard Al Zorkawi stories that had funnier endings in that.  Why don't you hop on out of here because we're done with you today.  That's right.  First of all, let me explain something.  Every story doesn't have to have a punk line when you're talking about kids and you're talking  a punk line. 
[01:51:00]  I'm not saying it's your punk line.  I got, I got, well, I got a little water in my mouth on that one.  Okay, let's come after me.  Take your lily pad and get the hell out of here.  We're done with you.  I'm not saying it should have a punk line.  I don't mean that.  Okay.  I just meant it was just kind of meandering and it went from, eh, into boof.  Why don't you go play Frogger in traffic?  How many frog jokes can we get out?  Plenty.  I don't know.  I'm Voss, eh?  Hey, Kenny, Rich is hungry.  Get us some flies. 
[01:51:30]  All right.  That's a terrific story.  Thank you.  Frog was a queer.  Let's say hi to Rich.  He has an apology for Louis C.K.  Rich Voss.  Rich in New Hampshire.  He has an apology for everybody.  He has an apology for XM Canada and, oh, go ahead, Rich.  Outside a toilet stall with a mouthful of pollywogs.  Wow.  Horrible.  There you go.  Meandering mess.  There you go. 
[01:52:00]  You never disappoint, Rich.  Thank you.  I love Rich.  You never disappoint.  Mouthful of pollywogs.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my stomach.  Oh, that was a gem.  Yeah, right.  Should we go to New Hampshire?  Yeah, let's talk to Rich.  It's Rich.  Yeah, hey.  What's up, man?  I just want to apologize to Louis there. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, what for?  Well, I fell asleep at one of his comedy shows up in Massachusetts at the Kowloon, and my  wife was telling me that he kept on looking over at me, and, well, I feel really bad about  it now.  All right, hold on, Rich.  I got to stick up for Louis here.  He didn't fall asleep because you were having a bad set.  Oh, well.  No.  He passed out.  He drank too much, right?  He passed out of your show.  Yeah, no, I just want to apologize to him for falling asleep at his show.  Nothing that he did.  I mean, I enjoy his comedy.  He's a great comedy.  Dude, dude, what we're saying is it's not falling asleep. 
[01:53:00]  Up there it is.  Up in New England, like it is.  I just fell asleep.  It's called passing out from alcohol.  There's a difference.  It's not falling asleep.  No comic wants to hear that you fell asleep at his show.  Kind of makes it sound like he took both of his hands, put them together like he's praying,  and put his cheek on him at the table.  They don't mind hearing that you passed out at one of their shows.  That was putt.  The guy was drooling on his chicken wings.  He fell asleep like Alex in Clockwork Orange in the spaghetti. 
[01:53:30]  That was how he fell asleep.  Yeah.  I tried the wine.  All right.  No, you don't have to apologize for something I was completely unaware of.  Oh, okay.  Well, hey, no, I think that I do anyways.  That's just me.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Thank you very much for coming to see me at the Kowloon.  I got to cut you short because this is the $100 I would have won.  In the Mardi Gras, you know how they have the heads on the stick?  In the what?  In the Mardi Gras, the heads on the stick.  And how do you spell Mardi Gras?  M-A-D-R-I.  M-A-D-R-I.  Mother Gras? 
[01:54:00]  How do you spell M-A-D-R-I?  Mardi Gras.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  M-A-D-R-I.  Mardi.  Wow.  Mardi Gras.  You're not a real person.  You're not a real person.  You're not a real person.  There you go.  From earlier.  There you go, Rich.  Here's the deal.  It was early, and I wasn't really awake.  The case is rested.  How early is it that you spell Mardi Gras, M-A-D-R-I?  I made a mistake, okay?  What's the big deal?  Wow.  Only that you said that you didn't.  Right.  That was it.  That's all.  If you said, yeah, I made the mistake, but then you totally went. 
[01:54:30]  I did not say it like that.  Pull the tape.  Yeah, they could tamper with tapes, too.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, of course.  Somebody was back there.  All right.  Whatever, Rich.  Jesus.  Man, it was a frog.  All right.  Wrong.  Got to my tapes.  All he logs.  Rich is great on a stage.  Helium Comedy Club.  He's hilarious.  Thursday.  Very funny comedian.

[01:55:30]  We got some time left and stuff.  We're on XM and also CBS and Citadel with Louis C.K. and Rich Voss and me and Opie and Ant.  That was terrific, Jimmy.  I think there's a couple more that don't belong to either.  Oh, really?  I think so.  Hmm.  Oh, sorry.  I'm developing a cough now. 
[01:56:00]  This is great.  My girlfriend's sick and now I'm getting sick.  Oh, boy.  Let's see what happens.  Well, I think I infected.  I mean, we both have short throats.  Oh, by the way.  Now it starts.  By the way.  AIDS free.  Oh, you took your test again?  Oh, you took your test again?  No, no.  I'm giving it out.  Giving out AIDS for free.  AIDS free.  It's free AIDS, then.  Ah, yeah.  You got to say it right.  I got my test and I was good.  Wait.  You took it again?  Aren't you so nervous when you take that thing?  Yes.  You don't get AIDS from the test.  No.  Yes. 
[01:56:30]  Don't take that test.  Yeah.  Can we send a card?  They got a card for that somewhere?  Let me.  Well, let me.  I'm going to try to find a card from Grax.  Yeah.  Where are your next birthday?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  You made it.  Congratulations.  Wait.  Let me see.  I was buying a...  Sorry.  That's all right.  I had to get my gonorrhea and syphilis.  Oh, that's where you're going to have a problem.  Yeah, those are a lot more common.  You can have one of those.  You'll have something.  Yeah, but you can see that stuff in your underwear.  You can't see AIDS in your underwear.  You know what I mean?  Jesus.  Rick.  He wasn't.  I'm sure I know because I...  All right. 
[01:57:00]  You know how you've got that fine-tuned nose so you can smell underwear.  A little gonorrhea.  Yeah.  Chlamydia.  It's just a hint.  On the bouquet of...  He's like Hannibal Lecter.  You wear a landed comp and have syphilis.  We have to get this kid thing in before we get out of here.  Yes, please.  Really fast, though.  We're in the December issue of FHM.  Ant and I and Jimmy, of course.  And then Voss is in there with...  Otto, Patrice.  Patrice.  Bill Burr.  Otto and George, Patrice.  Yeah, Bill Burr and Bob Kelly.  Is that it?  That's the lineup?  And E-Rock took a bunch of photos behind the scenes. 
[01:57:30]  Yes, we did.  And now we officially can get those up on our website, opianthony.com, so you can check  out all the photos from the photo shoot that E-Rock was taking as the professional photographers  were taking shots.  When you've done 1,000 pictures of Opie and everyone else.  Yeah, they catch me and Ant in the background.  Yeah.  When you're done masturbating to FHM, you can read about the show.  Nice.  The photos are pretty cool because it's all behind-the-scenes stuff.  All right.  But this could be terrific.  Let's see how this goes. 
[01:58:00]  Grandma buys grandson scary children's songs.  This story starts out pretty normal, but...  They're not supposed to be scary.  But wait for the punchline because it's well worth it.  We got a call from an irate grandmother who was so upset over an innocent gift she bought  her grandson, she never thought it would affect him so badly.  You may even own one yourself and not realize what it is.  What?  Old grandma?  Debbie Jurgensen is a wonderful grandmother.  But she's feeling awfully guilty these days because of a gift she gave her grandson. 
[01:58:30]  To think that I gave this to him, thinking it was going to soothe him to sleep, and then  to find out that he went through four days of pure horror.  Happy endings.  And was hysterical crying every time he went in his happy little room, and it was my doing.  Believe it or not, the gift Debbie bought was this stack of children's CDs called 101  Toddler Tunes.  We started playing the CDs and putting them on at night for the little guy.  And he wasn't sleeping too well.  And then my husband thought it might be the music, and I thought he was crazy. 
[01:59:00]  And so one afternoon, I put it on to play with him in his room, and there was a ladybug  song.  This is just one of the songs little Michael had been forced to listen to while he tried  to fall asleep.  He tried to fall asleep just by himself.  Yeah.  With the little stars on the ceiling.  And you know, he's like scared of certain things in his room, little shadows, maybe  the chair looks like a monster when the lights are out.  I thought he was crazy.  His father's getting no credibility.  It's like, we just started playing some music.  Maybe it's the music.  What are you, crazy? 
[01:59:30]  What are you, crazy?  You stupid idiot.  Go home and earn money.  Go to work and earn money.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, something new was introduced.  Yeah, go put a roof over our heads, you useless piece of crap.  It's funny you picked that right up, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's what my radar is.  Just, yeah, shut up, woman.  Yeah, mothers know everything except for nothing.  Shut up.  Yeah, let's look at it logically.  What have we introduced to this child since he has had a problem sleeping?  The music.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:00:00]  No, it's not the music that I haven't listened to yet, that I let him stack a CD's.  I haven't even listened to one of them, because I'm lazy.  Well, here's the song.  All right?  While he tried to fall asleep.  Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home.  Your house is on fire and your children will burn.  Will burn.  They will burn.  Why go home, then?  Yeah.  There's no hope in this song.  Let's go get a drink.  Give the kid a little hope. 
[02:00:30]  Just take that money you're going to save from the following Christmas and buy yourself  something nice.  Will burn.  Ladybug, ladybug.  I can't believe this is what they're saying.  On fire and your children will burn.  Over and over again, too.  How great is that?  Your children will burn.  I love that they're trying to tell the ladybug to get home to save it, but they're singing  it so sweetly.  Yeah, it's such a nice, we'll burn.  Da-da-da.  Your baby's being raped. 
[02:01:00]  You better hurry home.  Who knew this was going on, man?  The kids are all going to look like raisins with wigs.  Nothing worse than a burn victim wig.  It never fits the head properly.  It's slightly askew.  It always looks like a hat.  Because there's that space between the wig and the awful head.  There's no way to fix it.  There's nothing to integrate it with.  That's right.  There's no hairline. 
[02:01:30]  There's no hairline at all.  It's just like a stormtrooper hat.  Let's go to Rudy in Westchester.  Rudy!  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey.  I was watching that story on the news, and they showed a picture of the kid.  The kid was absolute oblivious.  He was in La La Land with this stupid look on his face, and he didn't know what the hell  was going on.  And the grandmother was going on about happy, happy, happy, and horror, horror, horror.  And it just seemed so weird that this kid even had a clue as to what was going on with 
[02:02:00]  these songs.  And it just blew my mind, because I didn't believe it at all.  But it did run me into a state of paranoia, and I have to go listen to my kids' toddler's  songs as well now.  Yeah, nobody pays attention to what their kids are watching or listening to.  Or doing, or playing on the computer.  Or anything.  It doesn't matter.  I was in a kid's bookstore buying some books for my daughter, and this older woman came  in and said to everybody, it's a cheerful kid's bookstore in Hollywood.  And then this lady comes in and asks the sales lady, I need a book for a four-year-old boy 
[02:02:30]  whose father died.  Oh, God.  It's like, oh, God.  They have that section.  They have a section for your dad just died, you idiot.  How about mommy's roommate?  Mommy.  Lesbian moves in.  You're moving into a small apartment with your mom.  The parade of uncles.  Losers.  How about daddy had his brake lines cut, and mommy has a new check.  How about read the insurance policy?  Yeah.  We've got to go into these bookstores now and get some of these titles. 
[02:03:00]  All right, there's more to the story.  The children will burn.  That's nice.  I was really disturbed because my father is a retired fireman who recently actually just  lost a close friend.  So she's starting to grasp the concept of, you know, death.  Is he a ladybug, idiot?  Is he a ladybug?  You know what?  My father's friend was recently swatted by a giant hand.  Who cares if ladybugs die? 
[02:03:30]  I'm starting to grasp the concept of, you know, death.  I felt horrified because these babies are very precious to me.  And there were more tunes, like the little brown jug.  Uh-oh.  Oh, jug.  I mean, this is a toddler song.  It's about booze.  This is a toddler song?  Come on.  And this one, Casey at Bat. 
[02:04:00]  Kill him.  Kill the umpire.  I mean, kill him.  Kill the umpire.  I mean, that's not what you say to children.  Exactly.  Obviously, you've never had any money on a game.  Listen to the CDs first, you idiot.  Yeah.  What's wrong with the children?  It's not like you're saying molest the umpire.  No.  Or offer the umpire money to get in your van.  Kill him.  Kill him.  Kids.  No, it'd been funny during the whole interview where ladybug lands in her hand and she walks  in.  Or an umpire walks in and she just yells at him.  Kill him.  Kill him.  Maybe this kid's not sleeping well because his family sucks. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  He's a bunch of adults.  A bunch of idiots.  How am I going to be raised by these jack-ups?  How am I going to have any kind of a life?  They're blaming the music and they're like, we didn't know it was the music because I would  drink a lot and my husband would hit me and we would scream and yell and we'd wake up  and we didn't know it was the songs.  The kid should be happy as his own CD player at that age.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Now, one of the things you should know is that these nursery rhymes aren't exactly new.  Some of them are classics and they've been around for more than a hundred years.  In most cases, they were a history lesson. 
[02:05:00]  Like when the ladybugs infested the fields of England.  Hence the song, Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home.  So the big question now is, are the words in these rhymes appropriate for today's generation  of kids and parents?  Ew.  Oh, man.  Ew.  That's the big question.  We've got to attack everything.  The big question is, why does America stink?  That would be the bigger question.  I'm so tired of stuff like that.  No kidding.  Nicole in New York.  How about London Bridge is falling down, but at least they're not jumping off it like 
[02:05:30]  they are the Golden Gate.  That's the updated version for today's kids.  Run with that.  Guys, production staff, go.  I'll do it.  My daughter, my kids are supposed to not, my daughter and I were eating lamb chops one  day and she said, she's three years old at the time, and she said, what are we eating?  And I said, lamb chops.  And she'd been to a farm recently and petted a lamb.  So she said, are there little lambs inside of this?  And I said, no.  Like I'd never made the connection with her that she eats animals. 
[02:06:00]  What a stupid question.  Yeah, I know.  Are little lambs inside?  Of course there aren't.  Yeah.  You're dope.  So I go, no.  And she says, well, are these pieces of a lamb?  Ah, now she's catching up.  And I go, yeah, they are.  Yeah.  Just told her, yes.  So we're eating a lamb like the one I petted?  And I said, yeah.  And she says, I like lamb chops.  Oh.  She's like Hannibal Lecter.  No, she likes eating animals.  There you go.  She likes eating animals.  She's full aware that she, you know.  Top of the food chain.  She loves ducks and she loves eating ducks. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Did the lamb make you perform fellatio?  Did he decodomize you?  No.  He was a good lamb.  Hey, let's go to Nicole.  She's got something pretty good.  Don't go.  Hi.  Yeah, I took my three-year-old brother to the library and the librarian pointed me over  to this section.  I guess she thought I was like some unwed teenage mother.  So there's like why you had sex when you were 10.  And there's a book about Uncle Willie's pickles and how to deal with molestation and why is Daddy 
[02:07:00]  in a casket.  All right, wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on.  I have an assignment.  I have to read Uncle Willie's pickles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could someone go out and get Uncle Willie's pickles and get it over to XM for the second  half of the show today?  Why is Daddy in a casket?  It sounds awesome.  Maybe Daddy in a casket.  Maybe Daddy's a bad driver.  Or maybe Daddy...  Oh, Nicole.  This is going to be much more exciting here.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Nicole.  This whole section is like in the middle of the children's playroom, like pictures of 
[02:07:30]  really tickling kids, like awful, awful books.  You know, I want you to have a sandwich just full of Uncle Willie's pickles.  The thing that bothers me is that people want to protect their kids from reality, but then  they want to sell them stuff.  Like that's what's acceptable is like Fox Kids, where they're selling them toys and cereal  with loud noise and MSG and sugar.  Like nobody cares about that.  That's fine.  But don't mention to them that things do die and that it's okay that things die, especially  if it's your stupid father. 
[02:08:00]  Well, the Daddy in a casket thing does seem a little morbid.  Like how could that possibly play out?  Why is Daddy in a casket?  Well, he's going to be in it until bugs eat his face.  Daddy borrowed money from a man and Daddy couldn't pay him back.  Maybe Daddy mingled with someone of a race that he shouldn't have here, here.  For the Brady kids, why is Daddy in such a little casket?  Why is Daddy face down in a casket with a permanent arch in his hips? 
[02:08:30]  Well, you know, that man he played on TV.  Why is Daddy in a closed casket?  Well, because his face is pulp.  Oh, God.  Because we couldn't reconstruct his...  No.  I wouldn't play that.  Do you think there's room in our society for these old-time classics?  No, I don't think so.  The kids today are smart, and they can pick up on things like that. 
[02:09:00]  Well, you know what?  A hundred years, one complaint.  That's not too bad.  Okay?  All right?  That's a good track record.  That is true.  Good point, Rich.  Good point.  Helium Comedy Club all weekend for Rich Voss.  And it could tie in, actually.  We'll have to just change the update.  How about immigrants?  Immigrants fly away home.  Huh?  Huh?  Give me those ribs, you.  Well, let's see what a child psychologist has to say about this issue.  There's nothing inherently wrong unless you want to do away with Snow White, Hansel and Gretel. 
[02:09:30]  But child psychologist Dr. Victoria Beach doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.  After all, she says, children have been listening to these nursery rhymes for more than a hundred years.  Casey at the Bat was in 1888, and it was published in the newspaper.  Very famous poem.  Way over the head of toddlers.  Kill him.  Kill the umpire.  Quite frankly, if you don't want your children to hear kill the umpire, you should never let them watch a baseball game. 
[02:10:00]  And her advice to parents is simple.  Children will repeat what they hear.  So if you don't want them repeating it, don't play it.  So for mom and dad, you heard the doc.  The bottom line is pretty clear.  Just use your discretion when it comes to your kids if you don't like what you hear.  Yeah, just let them listen to soulless Barney and Elmo.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Teach them nothing about anything and milk toast.  Don't chase them across the street in Crown Heights with a bat. 
[02:10:30]  What is wrong with him?  Hey, we're going to find that book for Jimmy?  Oh my God, Uncle Willie's pickles.  That's all I want.  Yeah, where's that?  I'm obsessed with them.  We've got to find that.  Uncle Willie's pickles.  How many pickles does he have?  I know, exactly.  He's got a bunch of pickles.  Well, I guess Uncle Lee had a lot of friends who also had pickles.  We're going to do the walkover in a couple minutes here.  So if you've got that book, come find us.  We'll let you check out the second half of the show.  Let's throw rocks through the moneylenders' windows.  It's based on history. 
[02:11:00]  Come on.  Let's take your teeth.  Oh, send them to the camps.  Send them to the...  It's history.  Send them to the camps and their luggage will follow.  Luggage will follow.  That's true.  Use the hair for soap.  Yeah, just because it's based on history.  One person's like, well, these are based on historical.  Oh, okay.  We'll drop.  That's good.  We'll drop leaflets, then bomb them. 
[02:11:30]  Burn those shadows on the bridges.  Burn the shadow.  Slaves are very useful.  They lift heavy things.  You get to own their children.  And you can examine their teeth first.  All right, let's get some plugs in.  Rich Voss, thank you.  Thank you.  Helium Comedy Club all weekend long, starting tomorrow night, right?  Yeah, thanks.  It's a great club down there.  We met the staff.  They're really, really cool.  And Louis C.K. in Vegas, November 16th and 17th. 
[02:12:00]  U.S. Comedy Festival in Vegas, or whatever it's called.  TheComedyFestival.com.  And Lowell Jimmy Norton.  Hammerstein Ballroom this Friday.  You can get tickets to Ticketmaster.  And it's actually selling very well.  It's not sold out yet, so come down if you can.  See, Jimmy.  Let's get a last-minute push for Jimmy.  Yeah, it would be nice.  Support your pal, old Jimmy Norton.  A bunch of us.  Bad news with a tumor.  I don't want to talk about it until Saturday.  Oh, by the way, there's an after-party at Headquarters Strip Club.  We're sponsors on this show, I believe.  50 listeners or 50 guests of audience members are going to get a VIP thing of an open bar, 
[02:12:30]  which is a horrible judgment error.  Wow.  Did they make a mistake?  And how are you going to pick those people?  I don't know yet.  I mean, this just came about, but there's going to be an after-party that I will be at Headquarters.  And, wow, boy, say goodbye to that business.  50 drunks from this show.  No kidding.  What an error you guys made.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  Louie, thanks.  Are you joining us, or what are you doing?  Sure.  Oh, right.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  Let the cursing begin.  Bye!  How am I going to go to XM?  Oh, boy.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thank you.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony Wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it. 
[02:13:30]  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Crappy day in New York City.  Raining like crazy.  It's raining.  Time for the walkover to XM.  Are we going to get that kid's book?  Children's book?  It turns out it's not pickles.  I know.  We got a copy already?  Which would be great.  We're getting it.  We'll get it.  Uncle Willie's tickles.  Yeah.  Tickles. 
[02:14:00]  Uncle Willie's tickles.  No.  And it's about to know.  It's even better.  Because that means that Uncle Willie has been doing a little hands-on coochie-cooing.  Yep.  And causing discomfort.  But we're going to get it?  Oh, that's great.  Good old Uncle Willie.  What a trooper.  Yeah, they've got to pour it on with a name, too.  It can't be like Uncle Earl's tickles.  Yes, it's got to be.  They try to try the previous...  Uncle's penises.  It's like Uncle fucking Uncle Scrotum's ass fuck. 
[02:14:30]  I don't think the Walmarts will carry that.  Old Uncle memory repressor.  I don't think any uncle should tickle any child.  Ever.  Not at all.  Just go right for the fuck.  It's not worth whatever the benefit is.  You know?  The possibility that he's fucking your kid in the ass.  Don't tickle my kid, all right?  You faggot.  There's so many times on sitcoms and stuff that you're watching, and guys are so inappropriate  with young children on the show, picking them up and playing with them in a way that if 
[02:15:00]  you ever did that, you would be either punched in the face by the parents or arrested.  Oh, yeah.  But in sitcom world, it's totally acceptable.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  I would never let my kid be an actor in a sitcom or anything.  No, no.  No.  It's another thing, yeah.  Some grown man is touching your kid.  Just because there's a fucking camera rolling doesn't mean...  Yeah.  Money's being made.  The kid's going to be fine with it.  No, of course not.  All right.  Stick your finger up the kid's ass.  The kid's like, yeah, it's a show.  It's a show. 
[02:15:30]  It's a show.  The good news is she's paying for her own college, the bad news, and she sleeps on her  stomach for six weeks.  God damn it.  Look at Kenny holding the umbrella over Opie.  Oh, it's the most full.  Kenny's hair grabbing for the water thirstily.  That dry hair it is.  It's like a cheap head.  Oh, my God.  It's thirstily grabbing for water.  Thirstily.  All right.  Which way are we going today?  I say we cross right here, Opie.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Well, now...  Look, the hand's blinking red, Jimmy.  Ah, fuck.  Oh.  Now we got to go straight.  Oh, you should see this funny thing I say.  It's about talk to the hand.  You're a scream.  Ah, here we go.  A mouth full of pollywogs.  Wow, is that funny.  Come on, Dan.  You have big golf umbrellas.  Does your umbrella have to be that big, ma'am?  How big are you?  What are you trying to do?  Keep your cunt dry?  Get out of here, you.  Oh.  Drop something.  No? 
[02:16:30]  You can get her.  Ta-da.  Umbrella man, how's business?  I'm welcome.  Business good?  It's cool.  All right.  What does he sell when it's sunny out, Jimmy?  All right.  I don't know.  Probably bricks to other homeless people.  Crack.  You know, with a white lady's head diagram.  Best place to hit.  Let's walk.  It's a strike here.  Oh, there we go.  It's a short walk today.  It's just too miserable out.  Oh, it's so cold.  Miserable.  You know, if it wasn't for those rainy days, you wouldn't appreciate those nice sunny days. 
[02:17:00]  That's right.  Way to take lemons and make lemonade, Ann.  Good point.  Is that hospital sign doing anybody any good up there?  Where is it?  Where is it?  It's up here.  There's a little triangle.  Wow.  What hospital is that for?  Is there a hospital sign that we never noticed?  Just right here.  It's like...  Yeah, look at...  Who's...  Oh, thank God.  Where?  Oh, I almost died because there's no arrow.  It doesn't tell you where it is.  It's just a hospital.  You just stand by the pole here and hope someone gets you.  It's just to give you the idea.  A hospital. 
[02:17:30]  That's a great idea because I'm dying right now.  Where can I find one?  The sign's like, I don't fucking know.  I'm just mentioning hospital.  That sign is no help.  No.  You start getting chest pains.  You look up.  All right, hospital.  Hospital, okay, but where?  The sign's like, fuck you.  You work it out.  Then you drop dead trying to figure out where to go.  Wonderful.  Only in New York.  Mind your business.  Just that big yellow hospital sign.  Yeah.  Flea has the portable PalTalk.  PalTalk. 
[02:18:00]  Camera.  Good?  Yeah.  They're filming us for the computer right now.  Portable.  Oh, my goodness.  It's like the cell phone of 1983.  What can't they do?  They're holding a big fucking hip bag.  Look at how big this umbrella is coming our way.  Isn't it?  Oh, my God.  Is that necessary?  Why is your umbrella so big, sir?  That is as tall as you are.  Excuse me?  Why is your umbrella so big?  I, for the, yeah, you know.  Eleven of his relatives came to this country in that umbrella.  I think he stole it from someone's backyard. 
[02:18:30]  I think that was on a picnic table.  I think it was in an outdoor cafe.  Did you hang a woman that was yelling at you for some construction work?  All right.  Go.  Good point, Andrew.  Let's move on.  Does look just like the guy in the paper.  What's Tyra doing?  Oh, if only she was shutting up.  Why is Kupak still selling records?  Oh, my God.  He's got another CD coming out.  Unreleased music features.  Oh, my God.  Has he been dead 10 years?  Yeah.  Yeah.  10 years he's had. 
[02:19:00]  I think there's a glory hole in here.  Maybe.  Scrape away Tyra's mouth and you can stick your cock right in there.  By the way.  I might shut her up.  This documentary called Fuck.  I saw it the other day.  It's hilarious.  What is it?  It's a whole documentary on the word fuck.  Wow.  It's hilarious.  We got an advanced copy.  I checked it out at home.  Even the Janine Garofalo part.  Ah, that was a little shaky.  I'm not going to lie to you.  That was a little shaky.  But the rest of it was really, really good.  I don't know if I'd go for that talk.  They talk about the FCC and George Carlin and the 730 words. 
[02:19:30]  And what is the actual definition of fuck and all that.  It's very, very good.  I'm telling you.  As far as documentaries go.  Check it out, Ant.  Everybody taking shelter from the rain.  I don't like Voss's short jacket.  Fucking shit's like a waiter's fucking jacket.  Hey, bring me some clam chowder, dumb Jew.  Right inside today. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  See you upstairs.  We're going to cast her on the elevator.  Oh, my God.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm Dave.  James Norton.  I like yogurt. 
[02:21:00]  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back.  guitar solo 
[02:21:30]  guitar solo 
[02:22:00]  guitar solo 
[02:22:30]  Hi. Sorry. 
[02:23:00]  How long did that go?  That was like forever, right?  Yeah, shit.  We got stuck downstairs.  One of the elevators was out of commission.  And when they all work, it still takes forever.  I think those are like steam-driven elevators down there.  It's the worst elevator system in any building you've ever seen.  They're always working on them. 
[02:23:30]  So it took forever.  Jimmy cut a couple of good gassers.  That was entertaining, but that...  It was playing for 10 minutes.  Well, there was something up in the elevators.  What was up with the elevators?  I don't know.  There was one in the construction.  Yeah.  It took forever.  My God.  It's not our fault, people.  We want to come up here and entertain.  Why are they not...  I don't know, Jimmy.  Not what.  I'm annoyed.  I want the name of this channel to have Opie and Anthony in it for name recognition. 
[02:24:00]  Because I was looking at Oprah and Friends is Oprah and Friends.  You know why?  Whose channel is that?  Bob Edwards?  Exactly.  Oh, the Bob Edwards.  That's his show.  It's Bob Edwards.  Wow.  Public radio.  We got a lot of dumps today.  Did we?  You want Kenny to do the dumps today?  I think so.  Kenny's got charisma.  He's got spunk.  Club soda, Kenny.  Dry hair.  Rich's mic for a minute.  No, he's not.  His hair's looking good.  Nice.  Hey, what's up with this, by the way?  I have no clue.  Andy from London, England. 
[02:24:30]  One Experience Podcast is number 18 in the iTunes video podcast chart.  What is that?  I don't know.  I'm actually not familiar with it.  And you know?  No.  Never heard of that.  You're usually up on that.  It's a video podcast.  iTunes video podcast chart.  The One Experience Podcast is number 18.  Oh, okay.  Anyway, you know, somebody turned one of our videos, whatever it was, into some kind of  downloadable podcast for your iPod.  Oh, nice.  And I guess it's doing well. 
[02:25:00]  Pal Talk, Eric says.  Young Hawk says Pal Talk.  Oh, Pal Talk video?  Yep.  Of what?  Studio.  Oh, and they just like podcast that every day?  Yep.  Oh.  There you go.  Sam's going to be happy about that.  Pleased this punch, I'm sure.  All right, Kenny, time for the Dump Report.  Live from the O.B. and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Wait, look at Kenny's glasses.  And I don't know.  You want me to try to do them without it?  He's like Walter Cronkite when Kennedy died.  Oh, yeah.  It was 3.15 this afternoon. 
[02:25:30]  Jim Norton said cunt.  The nation mourns.  Dab your eye.  Take your glasses off.  The glasses aren't even that bad.  It's the fact that you don't have them all the way up when you read.  Are they bifocals?  Does Club Cronkite have bifocals?  No, no.  I just need them for a reading.  Ew.  Why don't you take them off and try it?  I want to see how you do without them.  This one's for long distance, and then when I look up, I could beat a perp skull in.  Well, it's like we were talking today.  It was somebody who did something he didn't like, and he goes,  I told that guy, like, look, I took the heat. 
[02:26:00]  I didn't tattletale on you.  Tattletale.  He says tattletale.  All right, Serpico.  It's very demeaning.  All right, go ahead.  6.42 a.m., that Canadian guy.  Yeah.  Fucking right on, fuck, and another fucker, too.  Wow, really?  It's great.  I didn't realize that.  He's an unrefined fellow.  I didn't know that Canuck who had such a potty mouth.  7.48 a.m., is she having an orgasm or decomposing? 
[02:26:30]  Orgasm.  Really?  Why can't you say, is she having an orgasm?  Because women shouldn't come.  They're dirty.  Yeah.  That's why.  All right.  Now I...  Cut off their clitorises and let them do their jobs.  Under our bodies.  You're not...  You're not trying to do a womb with teeth.  You're not doing the job here.  First of all, you missed 7.44.  All right, I'll have my glasses on.  All right, I'll have my glasses on.  Blind ass. 
[02:27:00]  All right, get your glasses on.  Because this is very entertaining for the folks.  Because when he describes how the curse was used is the funniest part of this, though.  All right, I'll...  Go to 7.44.  I'm sorry, I missed 7.44.  If the light hits his glasses and his hair, it bursts into flames.  That's why you can't use them out in the sun.  You can only read with moonlight.  7.44, Mr. Louis C.K.  Somebody did me in the mouth during discussion of doctor who sexually assaulted or raped patients 
[02:27:30]  after they were knocked out.  Someone fucked my throat is what I meant to say.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought I cleaned it enough.  You might as well have just said that.  Can I say someone treated my mouth like a cunt?  You know what?  You might as well just let it fly, Louis.  Yeah.  So the X-Amers could enjoy it.  I guess so.  And then 7.48, Rich Voss.  Is she having an orgasm or decomposing during a discussion of a story where somebody dug  up a body and had sex with it?  That's a bad dump.  That should not have been dumped.  Bad joke. 
[02:28:00]  No, it is.  But it's...  I'm teasing, of course, Mr. Voss.  That should not have been dumped.  No.  It shouldn't have been dumped.  It should have been dumped.  America needed to hear that on election morning.  Right.  The next day.  This is a new era.  Exactly.  The Democrats have taken over.  Was she coming or...  No more fear.  Yeah.  No more fear.  Maybe that'll be better for us.  The Democrats take over.  No, it won't.  All right.  No, it won't.  Al Gore's cunty wife is the one who started all that label.  That's right.  That's right. 
[02:28:30]  PMRC, man.  Remember that?  She is cunty.  She is cunty.  Want to put labels on her albums, man.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Shut up.  What was she for the Ladybug song?  I know.  I know.  Hey, Rich.  That a boy.  Very good.  Uncle Rich's tickles.  Nice call back.  That's sleeping her fucking husband's withered switch.  I'm going to call Tucker Carlson, man.  You're right there, man.  That's true.  Got to get you a spot on MSNBC.  Political humor.  Here's how you know voices about saying something dumb.  Because his hands are stiff and he starts to use his hands.  Rich, you use your hands when you get nervous. 
[02:29:00]  And his hands go out and his eyes open wide and you just know he's searching.  And all he's saying is, please, God, let this come out right.  I know what I mean.  Please, God, let it come out right.  His hands get stiff and he just shakes them.  You can't tell if he's making a fist ever either.  No.  You just don't know.  Bendless fingers.  It's just the same.  Like John McCain's arms.  Something happened.  Tiny.  Did you lose your hands in Vietnam?  What's going on?  They replaced him with turtle feet.  Something's going on there. 
[02:29:30]  They are weird.  They're awful.  I never noticed that.  They're the gargoyle hands.  The first night we were eating dinner and then you looked at my hands and you just stopped  and go, look at your hands.  They're like not evolved.  That's exactly what they're doing.  There's one knuckle.  He's one knuckle short of a human hand on each finger.  But they're all the same size.  His thumbs and his fucking middle fingers are the same.  Yeah, they're all the same size.  I'm weird.  Like everyone else, the middle one's a little longer and then... 
[02:30:00]  If my kid drew his hands that way, I would fucking punch her.  Learn how to draw you stupid little cunt.  What's wrong with you?  It's not how you draw a human hand.  What the fuck are you doing?  I've got web...  Web hands that aren't connected.  That's what it looks like.  And he's a great golfer.  I don't get it.  I've been trying to stupid little cunt.  Fucking beat her for that. 
[02:30:30]  All right, Ken, continue.  Oh, that's fucking funny, man.  7.49 a.m.  Louis C.K. again.  Drink this homeless guy's urine.  I can't drink piss?  What's wrong with that?  They didn't say piss?  No.  No.  I used a clinical term.  Yeah.  Right.  A minute later, 7.50, Louis C.K.  Jesus, sorry.  Touch their bodies with your penis.  All right.  Well, that's...  We knew where that one was going.  No, we didn't see.  I knew it was coming out.  We sacrificed that.  7.54, Dane Cook chimes in, 
[02:31:00]  we should all be molested by third and fourth graders.  Ah, that's not what it says there, Kenny.  It's not.  No, by third or fourth grade.  You must be molested by a third or fourth grade.  That's what I'm thinking.  How lucky it'd be.  You made it funnier, but the line was,  we should all be molested by the third or fourth grade.  Oh, okay.  That's different.  I thought it was a typo.  That's a CBS thing.  Yeah, they have a problem with...  Any hot stuff.  Youngster stuff.  Yeah, kid stuff.  They're like, no way. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, well.  7.54 a.m., Rich Voss has a small penis.  I didn't say that.  Why can't you say that?  Because facts are not allowed on the radio.  8 o'clock, Louis C.K.  After Voss said 12 inches, you mean his penis?  Oh, my God.  What baby's out?  What, Al?  What are you doing?  Is that an FCC thing?  Yeah, the FCC has tightened up, unfortunately.  820, I like this one from Louis C.K. 
[02:32:00]  Little girl vagina smell.  Yeah.  But that was, you were describing that as a father.  Describing a stinky daughter.  Smelly vagina in my daughter.  I desperately wanted to ask a lot of questions about that.  Yeah?  I've never heard that from a parent before that you could smell.  No parent would say it.  They're fucking liars.  They're just liars.  You can tell the difference between the ass smell and that smell at that age.  You can have any person.  Wow.  Fucking vaginas have a distinctive odor. 
[02:32:30]  If it's her ass, she's going to die soon.  If it's her fucking ass smells like fucking rotted clams.  That was really the wrong answer.  Did you have a clue?  It was really wrong.  I had no clue.  Not having any children or knowing any people with girls that I would be around while they're  dirty.  No.  I figured it smelled like powder and shit.  I didn't know what kids are.  I figured every kid smells good.  I thought it smelled like a...  When you have kids, as a guy, your relationship to the vagina, it just changes completely. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  There's always this mysterious, beautiful, little pouty thing that I only catch in glimpses  in the dark, maybe three times in 40 years.  And now I've got to clean shit out of two of them daily.  I have to literally scrape shit out of my daughter's little red vagina a few times a  day.  A few times a day.  Oh my God.  Is that important?  Got to get in there with the wipey, make a corner out of it, and get the shit out of 
[02:33:30]  it.  Holy fuck.  Every time she takes a shit, it goes straight up her gun.  Oh my God, I had no idea.  That's true.  The parents out there are all nodding.  Yeah, they're all going, yep.  I had no clue.  That's what it is.  No, and the four-year-old doesn't...  She is toilet trained, but she'll lay on the carpet spreading it out, like pulling  it open like a fucking hustler man, like Marilyn Chambers, like fucking yanking it open  and just going, man, like just lay there doing that. 
[02:34:00]  Why?  Because that's what people want to do.  I mean, that's the happiest I've ever seen any person.  It's her laying on the floor, pulling her vagina open for the world.  And I look at her and I realize that's a human being.  That's a human being being happy.  And for some reason, that's not okay.  And I have to like inhibit that so she won't be homeless.  I have to get her to stop doing that.  What do you mean homeless?  I don't want to put her up there.  She continues doing that.  She's going to be in a mansion somewhere. 
[02:34:30]  What are you doing?  Because that's got to be one of those awkward things where you don't want to put too much  emphasis on it.  No, you can't go stop that.  Yeah, yeah.  Stop that.  Don't be your animal.  But you have to tell her that that's not right.  So what do you...  You have to explain to her calmly that vaginas, when held wide open, hurt people's feelings.  Or you bring your wife in and go, why don't you start doing that?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, no, you just let her do it.  Yeah, I have no reason to stop her right now.  Yeah.  People don't come over that often.  But she will, like, she'll reach in her cute little girl underwear and scratch her asshole 
[02:35:00]  like a knuckle deep, stick her finger in her ass in front of people, and then smells  her finger.  She does that with no reserve.  Holy shit.  Norton still does that.  What the hell?  Yeah.  My ex-girlfriend used to do that.  One time I caught her.  Oh.  She was sitting on her ass, and her legs were up, and she was sniffing her asshole with  her finger.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Yeah.  Ew.  What are you doing?  No, like my, I had this moment with my, that's what it is really like, parents dress 
[02:35:30]  their kids up and bring them out in public so that we can all see how cute they are,  but at home it's just fucking disgusting.  I was taking a shit the other day, and my wife was out of the house, so I have to shit  with the door open, because I have to watch my kids, otherwise I have to gather them in  to watch daddy's shit.  It's the only alternative.  So I'm shitting with the door open and watching my daughter, who's standing there in a t-shirt  and no diaper, occasionally we want to let her vagina breathe and not have all these  American fucking products on it.  And I, she's watching her from behind, and just a little dark spot just appears between 
[02:36:00]  her cheeks.  Like I, and I didn't, honestly for a second I didn't realize what it was, because I've  never just seen an ass shitting in the open.  I know Jim has paid well for that.  He says, yeah, he missed out, Jim.  And then next thing I know, a fucking man-sized crap just fucking, right, she shits on the  floor, and then she slips on, I'm, keep in mind, I'm shitting at the moment.  She slips on her own shit, falls deeply into it, cracks her head, now she's laying in her 
[02:36:30]  own shit and crying her eyes out, because she got hurt.  And I, with shit hanging out of my ass, I gotta get up and waddle over, I gotta do the penguin  walk over, and pick her up and comfort her, and we're both covered in my shit, her shit.  The dog is trying to lick it up, because the dog loves my daughter's shit he tries to eat.  And now, and all the fucking man's house!  Yes, that's my house!  And they're speaking German.  And the tape's rolling.  But this is the stuff that happens.  That is fucked.  This is a regular day.  That is why I will never, ever take food from a child. 
[02:37:00]  I don't like children touch, like, like, so it's, yeah, oh, a cookie, you brought me  a cookie, and they're, like, slobbering over half of it, and someone in the house, though,  will eat this fucking piece of mucusy, spitty, shitty cookie.  I'm looking like, don't even get that kid fucking near me.  No.  I threw away a couch, because we had family, we had family come over, and two little boys,  sitting on the couch with their father, watching television, and the father goes, 
[02:37:30]  what did you just do?  And I'm sitting on the couch, like, oh, oh, Christ on a pony, what the fuck, yeah.  And the kid goes, nothing.  And the father goes, no, did you pick your nose?  And the kid starts kind of laughing, yeah, you wiped it on the couch.  He goes, yeah, it fell.  He goes, well, now we gotta look for it.  So they're foraging through my modular couch for a booger that they never fucking found.  No, of course not.  I then spent weeks sitting in a little shit chair, this beautiful couch, sitting in a 
[02:38:00]  shit chair, until a new couch is delivered, and the old one was thrown away.  And the old, by old, I mean maybe two years old, threw that fucking couch away and made  a new rule, no kids ever in my fucking house.  No, keep them out.  That's it.  My girlfriend had to go around, like, waist high with Windex and everything else, every  other kind of cleaner on the walls, because there's smear marks, nose prints made of snot 
[02:38:30]  on the sliding glass doors, little hand prints like the end of fucking Blair Witch Project  all over your walls.  I was like, that's it.  No, the most disgusting thing that happens is when we change the baby's diaper, and it's  a big, you know, just shit-pissed diaper, and then the dog, if we don't throw it away  immediately in a sealed container, the dog will find it and just fucking eat it and leave  the residue all over the floor.  Fucking chewed up, shit-pissed diaper.  How do you live like that? 
[02:39:00]  It's fucking wrong.  How do you fucking live like that as a human?  Just regretfully.  I know, right?  I regretfully.  Just with a huge amount of regret.  Like, I thought this would be a cool thing, having kids.  Hey, you hit a nerve there, Louie.  Let's go to John in Jersey.  Kenny, we'll get to you in a second.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's going on?  Hey.  First of all, I have a contest idea, if you'd like to run with it.  O&A nursery rhymes.  What?  Okay.  O&A type of nursery rhymes.  We heard you the first time.  Wait for my daughter, like, Jimmy with a transvestite. 
[02:39:30]  All right, crash me.  He knew he was up loud.  What else, John?  Louie, I wanted to say, though, I can totally relate to you about the vagina issue,  because I've wiped shit out of my daughter's vagina numerous times.  When I was born, I still have to get in there once in a while to fucking, you know,  when she craps herself with these eight-inch-friggin'-long logs.  Are you telling your wife?  That's the thing, isn't it?  You gotta, if you're a father, you should change diapers from the, you should change diapers  from the beginning.  That's the trick.  Because when they, when you first get diapers, they have this merconium, which isn't really 
[02:40:00]  shit.  It's just this black sludge that comes out of their ass from their firstborn.  Sludge.  And then it starts getting a little, uh, fetid.  Yeah.  You get, you, you work up to it.  You mix, you start mixing some other ingredients in there, right?  Because I went on the road for a while and I didn't, I went away from it and my daughter  kind of turned the corner on me and then I come back, I'm just, it's a guy's shit.  After a while, it's just a big fucking dumperoo.  Oh my God.  And you gotta clean it.  Well, that is the last brown thing you want to see in your daughter's vagina. 
[02:40:30]  I guess it could be worse.  That's killer for that.  That, you're killing.  All right.  Oh, that's so awful.  That's awful.  Doesn't it just sound horrific?  It just sounds horrid.  But don't you, I mean, you, what do you, you're, I remember when Jim and I were working  on my show and once we're about to go to, we're about to start shooting and he's eating  in the scene.  So I touch his food with my, all over the place with my hands because I know he has  to eat it professionally.  And he goes, uh, are you kidding me? 
[02:41:00]  I pay women to shit in my mouth.  You think I care?  Touch away, Lou.  I laugh at your fingers.  That was the funnest thing with Jim was when we were whispering to each other before shooting,  anything disgusting I would say to him, he would top it.  Oh, yeah.  One time I said to him, you know that AIDS started in your mother's ass.  And he goes, uh, yeah, what's going to end there too?  And then the bell rings, we're back. 
[02:41:30]  I remember one time, one of my favorite things was we were, we were doing a scene in the,  in the, it was me, him and Mike in the, in the bar area, the rest of the little diner  we were sitting in.  And there was a chick playing a waitress in the day before shoots.  And she had, someone bought her a shirt and you know, like the clear plastic long strip  on it that will say like, the gap, large.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  It would just say like a bunch of L's on it for a large.  Yeah.  She had it on her thing and he said, on her tit and she didn't know it was there.  And he said, all I want is for that to be there tomorrow when we shoot. 
[02:42:00]  Nobody catches that.  Please let nobody catch that just for her to shoot that stupid plastic clear thing  on her.  Have you ever walked out of the house with one of those on your pants?  Oh my God, on my pants, yeah.  Yeah, on the back leg of your pants.  Yeah, sure.  Absolutely.  Walked out of the apartment stores with that on.  All right, back to Kenny, the dump report.  Where were we?  8.24 a.m., on his knees, pleasuring someone for a vile.  Anthony, about Voss needing money for drugs, on his knees, gave it too much detail. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, it did not.  Come on, Al.  You gotta relax, dude.  That's really touchy.  Yeah.  I would love to see the station be fined for that.  It just wouldn't happen.  I've read transcripts of what the stations get fined for.  It's a lot more blatant than that.  Stop it.  Wait, wait, wait, hold on.  Yeah, I hear that too.  What is that?  It might be the wireless.  Oh, I thought it was music.  Okay.  All right, go ahead, Kenny.  8.40 a.m.  You can see that stuff in your underwear.  Voss talking about Norton and his STD test for syphilis and gonorrhea and how you know 
[02:43:00]  if you have it.  Yeah, let's get into this.  Because as soon as you said that, I knew they were going to dump out.  I'm like, come on.  We got to discuss this a little bit.  What do you see in your underwear?  No, when you have the clapper syphilis, you get a green drip in your underwear.  Oh, green drip.  You know what?  I'm glad they dumped it.  Holy fuck.  Well, I'm saying you could see it.  You know that you have the clapper.  That's why you go.  It burns or you have a discharge.  It's an infection.  What?  Stuff pours out.  Yeah, let's hear that one again.  Discharge. 
[02:43:30]  Discharge.  So, actually.  It's green?  I guess.  I don't know.  No, you know.  You all too well know.  And it was in the back.  Olive green.  Yeah, it's horrible.  You burn.  You about the clap?  Did I have it?  Yeah.  Please, when I was like 17, 18, back then.  He laughs at the clap.  You didn't have condoms back then.  He's the one that didn't have condoms.  He's the one who coined the phrase.  No, you didn't.  He used to go to the clinic and you'd know people. 
[02:44:00]  They're, oh, you're back again and this and that.  His underwear looked like a mess.  He got the clap so much that they'd applaud him.  That's how they started calling him the clap.  Yeah, Rich is back.  Hey, Rich is back.  Nice to see you again.  The worst.  He was making a boo for a while.  The worst was, I live with this girl.  And she was going down on me and I had the crabs and all of a sudden she sees this little  crab moving and she's going down on me and she flipped out.  I go, well, you're not going to finish?  I mean, you started.  Just get rid of, you know, you're flinging it off.  And those are the worst.  Fling it off. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, what's the big deal?  It's a crab, okay?  So you just get rid of it.  You know, you can't start giving someone head and stop.  Yes, you can.  I've had crabs three times.  Yes, you can.  You had crabs?  Yeah.  I had crabs once.  Did you?  Three times.  Wow.  Pretty awful.  God damn.  The babies are worse because they burrow in the skin.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kenny.  They burrow in.  Actually, when I got the crabs, a girl that I had just slept with called me and said, hey,  you have the crabs, you asshole.  And I was like, what?  And she said, I just realized I have the crabs, which means you gave them to me. 
[02:45:00]  I'm like, fuck you.  You gave me the crabs.  Ever settled?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  And you probably knew.  I hadn't slept with anybody recently, so I know where I got them.  Well, the crabs is not like a VD or a clam or anything.  You can get it from a toilet seat.  No one ever has, though.  You know something?  Yeah.  I've never gotten it from a bed or a toilet seat.  I've never gotten it.  Obviously, you never jerked off on a toilet seat before then.  Yeah.  As a kid, I jerked off on everything. 
[02:45:30]  Everything.  Toilet seats.  You can get it from a bed in a hotel.  You can also get it from a girl or a prostitute.  Right.  Maybe you ought to look.  Did you ever get it from a bed?  Did I?  Yeah.  This was years ago.  I don't remember where.  I'll tell you where I got it from.  A 19-year-old.  No, I was 19.  She was like 16 or 15, black girl.  And her pussy smelled so bad.  I could smell it.  We were sitting on my steps, and she was standing two steps away, and I could smell 
[02:46:00]  her pussy through her jeans.  I know.  It was like she was smuggling a fucking platypus carcass in her underpants.  It's fucking reeked.  I was fucking this girl.  Her pussy was so bad.  I had to lean over the side of the bed, and I was dry heaving.  I'm not lying.  I was dry heaving as I'm fucking her.  Didn't stop, though.  Well, thank God that I'm a bad fuck, and I would come quick.  This way, I killed two birds in one shot.  It was so bad, that fucking horrendous smell. 
[02:46:30]  Here's the worst.  When you pull your dick out, and it reeks, and there's that fucking white slime on the  base of your dick.  Oh, man.  That's a yeast infection.  Whatever it is.  Who knows?  That's probably why it reeks, too.  Yeast fucking kills a box.  Yeah.  When you fucking got that in your pubes, that fucking white, taked up shit.  Taste.  It's like fucking Betty Crocker.  I was in her vanilla dumper.  I picked up this fucking Mexican, and I was working Houston, and it was disgusting.  I'm fucking a little ... Then she leaves, and I look in the bed, and there's a wrapped 
[02:47:00]  up napkin that she was using as a fucking coat.  I didn't know she was ...  Oh, she had just wrapped a napkin in that.  I guess somewhere in the club, she put a napkin wrapped up as a coat, and I felt the  stuff that just went fucking her, and then I roll over, and I roll onto this bloody napkin.  Oh, God.  Did you put it in your mouth and suck on it?  No.  Oh, bad.  That would have smelled.  A little bloody burrito.  Like pennies.  What a history you have. 
[02:47:30]  And then you're mad at some girlfriend that wanted to blow you while there was a crab  in your ...  Crab and wine in her eyeball.  You have wildlife in your pubes.  Fucking an elk on your balls, and you want to know why she won't suck your cock.  You selfish asshole.  All right.  Let's finish up the dumbest one.  Oh, there's more.  Wow.  Yeah.  841, Louis C.K., when you're done masturbating to FHM.  Yeah.  Yeah, they hate masturbating, that word.  They're such babies.  I know.  You got to say, stroke the baby, producer. 
[02:48:00]  That's not even an FCC word either, masturbate.  Speaking of FHM, they should get the monthly issue with you guys in it.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Good tie-in, Kenny.  Very nice.  Good plug.  And behind-the-scenes photos on opianathlete.com.  Cool.  We finally got those up there.  Go ahead.  844 a.m., Louis C.K. again.  Your baby's being raped.  Ah, well.  Maybe.  Well, you know.  That's maybe.  Oh.  Nice.  850 a.m., Mr. Norton. 
[02:48:30]  Did the lamb make you perform fellatio?  Did he sodomize you?  Oh, my God.  All right.  No, that has to go.  Does it really?  Yeah, new FCC.  To make you perform fellatio?  It's not even dirty.  I think all of it is ridiculous.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's ridiculous, but...  It's meaningless.  Go ahead.  Last one.  Last one.  850 from a caller.  Why did you have sex when you were 10?  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  That one is...  Eh, it's another one of those.  Too young.  Kid stuff.  It wasn't talking in any detail about...  Ah, whatever.  Well, this started fun, and now it's like, this sucks.  All right, we'll continue.  We got lots of other things to do today.  We got some Dice audio?  Oh, yeah.  Dice smashes one of the O&A pests at one of his shows.  One.  So now...  That was half his crowd.  Well, we'll talk about that next.  We got a reporter messing up and saying, top cock.  This is really funny. 
[02:49:30]  Top cock?  Yeah, Louis C.K. in studio, playing Vegas November 16th and 17th.  Yes.  Voss, starring tomorrow night at Helium Comedy Club, all weekend long in Philadelphia.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  It's not nude.  It's just girls flashing guys that have W-O-W on their vehicle somewhere.  That's the WOW campaign.  Wow.  For details on how to get your very own WOW sticker, go to opiananthony.com.  Look at that WOW.  It's still happening.  Oh, it's the WOW.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[02:50:00]  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM.  On sale now.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I like welcoming everyone back to the Opie and Anthony radio program here on XM Satellite 
[02:50:30]  Radio.  Now we're only on XM Satellite Radio with Louis C.K. and Richard Voss and Ant-Nope, myself,  and Hawkins fans.  Thank you.  It was brilliant when we went to break.  Wow.  Listening to Voss trying to make poignant statements, I want to hug him.  It was good stuff.  Rich, thanks for listening.  Yeah.  See, he agrees.  He knows.  He says really deep things like, it's about money.  And then he opens his eyes wide like conversation over.  The almighty dollar.  That's right.  Hit them in their pocketbooks. 
[02:51:00]  And seatbelts on buses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Somehow it went from the, you know, horrors of hijacking and why there weren't locks on  cockpit doors to seatbelts on buses.  You know what it is?  He saw some expose like last night and couldn't figure out a way to talk about it.  And today he figured out a way.  Like it just happened that we went in that direction.  You know.  I thought he was making some sense.  I don't know.  What's that?  I thought he was making some sense.  Yeah.  Thank you.  But see, here's the thing.  You know, we're talking about hijacking and anthrax.  And this idiot's opened a box from a stranger. 
[02:51:30]  No, here's the box.  It's not from a stranger.  Oh.  It's from Dirty Ralph.  The guy's the greatest.  Oh, it's Dirty Ralph.  He's got me Sabbath and Kiss CDs and DVDs.  Oh.  There's a friend of mine that I threw the show.  He sends me good stuff.  Thank you, Dirty Ralph.  But I do make a lot of sense.  I do know.  You don't make sense.  Yes, I do.  We're talking about senators and lobbyists and making deals and who's running the country  and who's, you know.  But you were saying it's a conspiracy.  Yeah.  And then you were just straightened out by everyone.  Louie's talking about how big business has just kind of really runs our lives more than the  politicians do in the government just based on the fact that they're the ones that supply 
[02:52:00]  us with everything we need on a daily basis to live as humans in this country.  And you brought up a conspiracy.  No, no.  It's like no one thought 40, 50 years ago that this was going to be the end game.  It just capitalism evolved into this as like communism evolved into something that didn't  quite work.  Capitalism is evolving into this other thing where business has a lot of power.  No, it's like the way that Halliburton supplies the soldiers and so they charge whatever  they want.  Right.  And they fuck it all up and nobody cares. 
[02:52:30]  No, I'm saying.  It's the same thing if you live in any town in America.  You're getting your food from ShopRite and your crap from Walmart and nobody else can  even send a truck there.  And there's no accountability by these other people or no, you know, that's just the way  it is.  But you're getting the only one person.  Yeah.  What I was saying, what I was saying is what he, what the author he was talking about  is making it look like a conspiracy.  What I'm saying is it's all about money.  He's not telling us anything we don't know when you were talking about Noam Chomsky. 
[02:53:00]  Noam Chomsky, yeah.  You know, saying it's these big businesses.  Speaking of Noam, how are those hands doing?  I think they were open that time.  I'm not sure.  Anyone else?  Yeah, love you on the Travelocity commercials, boss.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We got a news reporter that fucked up pretty good.  Oops.  This is some terrific audio.  The video's up on YouTube and Break.com.  Rich's headphones are not working.  Turn the volume up, Rich.  I did.  Oh.  Rich.  You can do it without headphones.  Sweetie. 
[02:53:30]  He won't hear the report up.  He won't hear the audio up.  That's true.  Oh, I see.  He's got to hear that.  Turn the volume up.  You plugged in?  I'm sure he's got something misspelled to say about this report.  Here we go.  The deputy police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock.  Top cock after a cop after the vehicle.  Wow.  Twice.  Wow.  She couldn't get cock.  How about that?  She had cock on her brain.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock. 
[02:54:00]  Cock.  I mean, big cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Yeah.  Wow.  Is that great?  Wow.  The deputy police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock  top cock after a cop after the vehicle they were riding in was sprayed with bullets.  Three other officers were hurt in the attack.  And those are your latest headlines.  I'm Jane Skinner.  I'm going to send you back to Shepard.  It is live where?  It's outside of Memphis.  Wow.  No, that's true.  Oh.  They're all laughing. 
[02:54:30]  South Carolina Gamecocks.  She's a big fan.  Go South Carolina.  Do you know how hard it is to read when everyone else in the studio is shaking with laughter  at your mission?  I know.  I've been there, Jane.  You too.  It works for me many billions of times.  Okay.  I love that.  Wow.  It's Friday, Jane.  No one's watching.  They're out doing things.  It's just me, you, and Dorella down in the distance.  That's it.  We'll look for you on YouTube there, Jane.  Thanks so much.  Oh, that's good.  I love that a policeman died and they're all laughing. 
[02:55:00]  They're all laughing over cock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Fuck him.  Who cares?  YouTube.  Cop.  Faggot.  Lead his life down for people.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  We got the cock line on YouTube.  It's great.  Watch this chick.  Deputy police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock.  Top cock after a cop after the vehicle they were riding in.  You can hear him starting to laugh.  Is that Otto doing the thing?  Top cock.  A cock was shot. 
[02:55:30]  Do we have the Shepard Smith one?  We have that.  And we should do Rip Cunt for Louie and the black cock one.  Come on.  Let him rip.  Yeah.  Let's do it a couple minutes here.  This was the Shepard Smith we got first.  This is the guy that was just talking to the girl after she fucked up saying top cock.  This is the guy that chimed in and said, we've all been there.  He's done this before.  J-Lo's new song, Jenny from the Block, all about Lopez roots, about how she's still a neighborhood gal at heart.  But folks from that street in New York, the Bronx section, sound more likely to give her a curb job than a blowjob or block party. 
[02:56:00]  The New York Post.  Sorry about that slip up there.  Yeah, sorry about that.  I have no idea how that happened.  But it won't happen again.  And that's your news.  That wasn't even close.  No, it wasn't.  Blowjob Bob.  Fucking cop, you know, fucking dick in the cunt.  I mean breakfast.  J-Lo's new film, Rape That Spick.  Wait a minute.  That's not what I meant to say. 
[02:56:30]  I meant maid whatever.  Deputy police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock.  Top cock after a cop after the vehicle they were.  Jesus.  You can't get cock off her.  One thing I'll say about dumb Shepard Smith, he did acknowledge it both times.  You got to give him that.  You have to.  We got this next one.  We haven't played in a while.  Easterly winds will be very strong, too.  And that will cause coastal flooding, very dangerous rip currents, as well as very high surf.  Wow. 
[02:57:00]  Rip cunts.  Do we have the idea that there's weather that's ripped, like there's going to be these cunts ripping through the sky.  I was going to say, was she talking about Louie's daughter?  Do we have the Tom Brokaw?  The Brokaw one we have?  Oh, we got that one, too?  How about the Martin Luther King one?  That's a good one, too.  Yeah, we'll play the other one there.  Play Brokaw, because that's kind of close to the last one.  Or play the one you got, Derek.  He had one.  All right.  Make it easy for him.  Continuing to follow the latest developments in the crash of Delta Flight 519149 people killed. 
[02:57:30]  Here's a Blackhawk helicopter surveying the scene.  We know the NTSB.  Blackhawk helicopter.  This is the latest rage on YouTube.  I mean, there's almost a decade to reporters fucking up.  Plane full of dead people.  Blackhawk.  Blackhawk.  Funny Blackhawk.  The Blackhawk helicopter.  How big was that helicopter?  Oh.  Huge.  Now, this is Tom Brokaw.  What do you want?  The bell.  Oh.  Thank you. 
[02:58:00]  There we go.  Close one.  I had a doozy.  A little inappropriateness.  This is Tom Brokaw, who has a hard enough time speaking as he is, but he was talking about  the president's tax cuts, and this was live.  The key component, and what the president insists, is a job stimulus program.  Ohio, a strong Republican state, is hurting economically, and as NBC David Gregory reports  tonight, the president took his message right to a powerful Ohio Republican who is not convinced 
[02:58:30]  the tax cuts are the answer.  See, he didn't fumble and go back.  No.  There's a little delay.  The tax cuts are the answer.  And his face, when you look at the video, is kind of like, oh, keep going.  Keep going.  You know, as a viewer, though, you're rooting for him to get to the end of the sentence.  Tax cuts.  He's just struggling to that period.  Oh.  All right, we got the Martin Luther one.  Yeah, this guy got fired for this.  It's crazy.  None of them got fired, except this guy did, because of the fuck.  This is what annoyed me.  And this is obviously a slip-up, I think. 
[02:59:00]  Of course it was.  Yeah, let's listen to it, and then we'll tell you what he meant to say.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of  days, well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  We're going to see temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head toward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  It was King, because he was going with Junior. 
[02:59:30]  It was Junior.  Martin Luther King Jr.  Yeah, he was rushing through it.  King Jr. comes out of Coon.  Black Hawk helicopter isn't fired.  Black Hawk.  A cop death.  Rip Cunt.  Rip Cunt.  And top cock over a police officer.  Six dead cops, and then no one of them are fired, but this guy makes a politically incorrect  obvious error, and they dump him.  Oh, can we do the, do you have the Mountain Climber one?  That is my favorite.  I forgot all about that one.  Oh, we do have it?  I don't know that one. 
[03:00:00]  Ah, so many of these.  This is for Lowy.  Okay.  Right after the break, we're going to interview Eric Weihandmayer, who climbed the highest mountain  in the world, Mount Everest, but he's gay.  I mean, he's gay.  Excuse me.  He's blind.  So we'll hear about that.  Okay.  As we head to the break.  Oh, my butt.  He's gay.  He's gay.  You know, there's some gossip.  Oh, shit, he's blind.  He's blind.  She went to lunch with the girls and got some nice gossip.  And that's all she was thinking.  And even she went, he's gay. 
[03:00:30]  Gay.  I mean, fucking blind.  Shit.  No.  Takes a dick up his ass.  Wait a minute.  He has brown eyes.  I don't know how I made that a solution.  He's so blind that people shoved dicks in his mouth.  He's made him gay.  He just can't see them coming.  But he was like, everywhere he goes, he's like, oh, jeez.  He's gay.  You know, the guy's sitting there going, and I'm, yeah, I'm blind.  But listen to gay.  Because she starts talking to herself like, gay?  Gay.  What are you saying?  I said that.  Yeah, who said that?  Yeah, let's hear that again.  It was me.  Right after the break, we're going to interview Eric Weyhenmayer, who climbed the highest mountain 
[03:01:00]  in the world, Mount Everest.  But he's gay.  I mean, he's gay.  Excuse me.  He's blind.  So we'll hear about that coming up.  Okay.  As we head to the break, I'll look at this.  They're not even close.  No.  There's not one letter that is shared by both words.  No.  Gay.  Blind.  No.  He's a faggot cocksucker.  Wait, I mean, he's a Republican.  Got a load of cum in both eyes, which blinded him.  God, we got a lot of requests.  You got the weatherman? 
[03:01:30]  Which one was that?  The black weatherman?  I don't want to give away the...  Yeah, I don't give away the punchline.  The bit.  In case people haven't heard it.  Uh-oh, E-Rock's pointing at the screen.  You know this isn't going to be the right clip.  Do you see the look?  God, I wish this was TV just to see E-Rock's disgusted look when I make fun of him.  Oh, he hates it.  Turns his head real quick like, it's such a fuck you.  And then he's back to whatever he does.  Yeah, exactly.  Back to the incompetent bungling.  We got it?  I guess.  I hope so. 
[03:02:00]  All right, here it is.  Be pushing across central Florida.  So places like Orlando, Daytona Beach, the Cape Canaveral area, Vero Beach will be getting  in on the heavier rainfall.  And eventually...  I should...  I am so sorry, Bill.  Oh my God!  What the hell is happening?  What the hell is happening?  This is what just happened.  That thing was crawling on my leg.  Oh. 
[03:02:30]  By the way, that guy is so fucking blind.  He is the blind man.  That is a flaming blind man.  That guy's gay voice came out.  That fella needs a dog and a stick with red on it.  Like he was hiding his gay voice for the most part.  You could kind of tell.  And then that...  It's a cockroach.  The cockroach appears.  A roach.  I think the other kind he would have liked.  And the ganus came flying out of the closet.  Oh.  Oh, we got another track to this, right?  And then this happened.  Oh God.  If there...  Oh my God!  There he is! 
[03:03:00]  Oh my God!  Oh no!  What a faggot.  Right at the wall for me.  The wall with a hole in it.  Oh my God.  Oh, what a fruit.  Jesus, it's a bug.  Yeah, I know.  And he's black like he's never seen roaches.  Oh.  I love when you see...  Like when there's this...  The kind of people that can't really hide.  Like that guy, the preacher, who's just been accused.  Oh, Ken Haggerty.  And I hadn't ever seen the whole story. 
[03:03:30]  And they discredit the gay prostitutes saying, well, he's a lie detector.  But then they catch the guy, I'm not gay at all.  And my wife, I love my wife.  This is fine.  He's so flaming.  And that guy had to really pop right out and go, okay, I'm a liar.  How great is it?  I do drugs and I like the cock.  How great is it?  Thank you.  Good night.  Thank you, my parish.  All these fucking scumbag religious people fucking just bothering gay people.  The only reason the guy came out against them was because this fucking guy was up there 
[03:04:00]  preaching against gay marriage and homosexuality is the devil's fucking work.  And this guy is fucking him every month.  Turns around and goes, you know something?  Fuck you.  Good for that guy.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  It's like the whole point, this guy's not Catholic, but I'll shit on them for it anyway.  Why not?  Because I'm not a politician.  I should have a bad judgment.  I'm just trying to be entertaining.  No, but it's like if you look at the Catholic Church objectively, it's like they are a boy 
[03:04:30]  fucking machine.  They're like the best boy fuckers in history.  It's almost the whole point of the institution.  It's like they do that better than anything else that they have tried to do.  They've worked it into an art.  It's amazing.  They have guys around when they get caught.  They move them around, they have their own internal investigations, so it doesn't involve  anyone else.  They made their own almost police force of this thing.  And all they do is, yeah, okay, this guy's fucking touching children here, we'll move  him over here.  Yeah.  Like he's going to stop.  And also, they're a vulnerable boy catching machine. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  Parents send him.  Their parents send him.  Fucking, here you go.  Go get your dick sucked.  Rape away.  Moving back for a second, Bert and Philly on the instant feedback, his last name is  Haggard, just like his asshole.  Yeah, fucking Pastor Ted was a naughty one.  Yes, he was.  Oh, Pastor Ted was a naughty boy.  Naughty boy.  We got any others back there?  Jones was giving him some muscle dick.  Do we have the one with the argument?  The argument.  I love the one that happened during Katrina. 
[03:05:30]  What?  I think it was during Katrina, the weatherman for CNN, and the anchor girl.  Okay, that's a good one.  The weatherman was taking a little too long.  I don't remember that one.  We might as well play all of them then, because we've got to play the L.A. news team.  That is a great one.  Another good one.  And Derek's got one here to play.  Because they're such puppets.  I mean, when they fuck up, it's great.  You simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals.  As Jack Cafferty just pointed out so tragically, so many of these people, almost all of them 
[03:06:00]  that we see are so poor, and they are so black, and this is going to raise  lots of questions for people who are watching this story unfold.  Wolf Blitzer, man.  Yeah, right on.  I watched that live.  Wolf Blitzer's on that?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  I watched that live when it happened.  I'm just sitting watching Katrina coverage.  It's all you did when that was going on.  I went home, turned on the news.  Yeah, better than Comedy Central.  It really was.  Just a scream.  And Wolf Blitzer's on. 
[03:06:30]  He's in front of his 20,000 TV screens.  And when he said that, I actually looked over at my girlfriend and said,  Did he just say that?  America said the same thing.  If you'd been standing anywhere, you would have heard that.  They are so poor and so black.  But where was he going with that?  I don't get, like, was it their tone?  I think it was trying to go into the fact that, you know,  they're not getting the help they need because of their race.  Right.  If it was a bunch of white people.  But to say they're so poor and so black.  Well, just that when- 
[03:07:00]  Not so many black people.  Yeah.  He's stunned by people's blackness.  You could say that about three people.  Jesus, those fuckers are black.  Two people in the room.  They are so black.  I think he meant there are so many that are so poor and so many black people.  Yeah.  But he fucked it all up just going, like, there's one guy that is just black as night.  Yeah.  So black.  Well, you can't blame him.  It's not like he's an eminent journalist or anything.  No.  It's not like that's a job.  Hasn't been in the business that many years.  Yeah. 
[03:07:30]  We got another one.  We got two more to play here.  But the storm was 902 billibars.  902 was the lowest that you had with this storm.  A couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit.  Filled in with some air.  Okay.  So, Chad.  Chad.  But Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk.  Okay.  Camille.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been. 
[03:08:00]  908.  I'm walking over here because you're wrong.  I have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury.  This storm got down to 26.61.  And right now it's 26.98.  Now, if you would go to your home barometer that you have, it's probably a big circle hanging  on your wall that you got from an uncle somewhere.  If you go look at that, that is completely off the screen. 
[03:08:30]  I got something from an uncle and it wasn't a barometer.  Did you ever have to have a barometer that would go that low in the Northern Hemisphere  unless you were obviously trying to get under a hook?  I don't fucking care.  Well, she was...  All right.  Just having fun.  Just having fun, he says.  He goes, all right.  Just having fun.  No, it wasn't fun.  You were angry.  Because she had every right to fucking jump in because he's babbling about barometric fucking  pressure.  That guy's an asshole.  Oh, what a tool.  I don't know who he is, but if you live in his town, please invite him to die on purpose. 
[03:09:00]  Please fucking encourage him.  I don't know that man, but he's a cunt.  How many more we got?  Just the L.A.?  All right.  And then we finally got this.  I don't think this made the air, Louis, but I guess...  During a break.  During a break, the news team went at it.  It's like a chick and a guy there in L.A.  And they just went at it just before the news started.  Listen to this tape.  First segment.  It's done that way all the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  You hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Tonight I'm complaining because tonight I said play. 
[03:09:30]  Then we better talk about it because I think you've got a problem.  I agree.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show and we'll talk about  it with Roger Bell because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up  with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Ann.  Why don't you take the ante up a little higher than that even?  Than that even?  You're not only wrong, you're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green, you might get him. 
[03:10:00]  That's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Oh, is it really?  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get it.  Awesome.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  That's how nice it is, man.  When news happens, you see it happen on Channel 7. 
[03:10:30]  Don't you?  The number one station for news and information in Southern California.  Now, Paul Moyer and Mark, Johnny Mountainweather and Todd Donahoe Sports.  This is Eyewitness News tonight.  Three men dead tonight in an execution-style murder in Los Angeles.  And he just goes right into it, man.  What a pro.  What a fucking pro.  Accusing his fucking lackey next to him of drinking when she goes home.  Do a few shooters.  I don't know who the fuck you come back at. 
[03:11:00]  In between the 6 and 11 o'clock news.  Tell you something, lady.  They go home and do whatever.  You're a different lady.  You're a different lady.  Do a couple of fucking shooters.  And she's just, I do not.  In a tone of voice, that means, yes, I do every fucking night to deal with you.  We got one more.  We keep finding them.  The Bill Evans and Steve Barlestein fight over Donald Trump's wife's name.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  Haven't you seen this?  This is a new dress.  There's something old, something new.  The weatherman is taunting the anchor guy.  Yeah, the anchor says her name wrong.  And the weatherman starts taunting him.  And he gets pissed.  Like, you're the fucking weatherman.  Why are you taunting me, motherfucker?  Have you seen this?  This is a new dress.  Something old, something new, and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for supermodel Melania Nels, the former, or the future, Mr. 
[03:12:00]  Wait, wait, go over that name again, Steve.  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  Why don't you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what, then?  Then I'd hike down over there during the video, wouldn't you?  Well, then what then, Steve?  Go ahead, do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I just, I wanted to know what you said.  No, if you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York.  And the bride plans another dress of hero-weighing design after the couple's first dance wedding is set for Saturday. 
[03:12:30]  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey, I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing.  I heard, no.  My bad, my bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology, Steve.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another?  No, I wouldn't.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff.  It is so cold outside.  It's cold in here, too. 
[03:13:00]  Take a shot at the weather if you want.  I don't know.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude, I get paid either way.  It's so cold for the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day.  We looked down and got that one on our own.  We just happened to be rolling.  We were watching that as it happened.  No one has that one.  That one never made it to YouTube or anything.  No, local people get in each other's asses.  They really do.  Sometimes when I do stand-up on the road, I do some TV morning show, as if anybody that's  watching the morning TV is going to watch the show. 
[03:13:30]  Those are the worst.  The worst.  But it was this one in Sacramento, and it was the usual team, kind of older guy and  lady with too much makeup.  But they had put in a young guy, hoping that that was going to beef up, you know, that's  going to bring in the younger people.  Get the ladies to watch it.  Yeah.  It was some fucking guy who had a show on Comedy Central for a minute.  I forget his name.  Chris something.  I forget his name.  It's called Quinn.  But so he, I said, hey, he said, yeah, I'm stuck here in Sacramento doing local news. 
[03:14:00]  What a shitty job.  You know, but during the break.  And I said, and sitting right next to him is the anchor who's been there for like 50  years.  And I said to the guy, to the young guy, you know, it's a job.  You should be grateful that you're working.  There's nothing wrong with local news.  It's a, it's a career.  And the, and the old anchor goes, yes, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Yes.  Oh, would you listen to him please?  And they got into a huge yelling match.  Oh, and then we're on the air in a second.  Hi.  Hey, how you doing everybody?  Spread the love.  We love each other. 
[03:14:30]  I love it.  We've had some of those around here a weekend.  Oh yeah.  Why don't you play the Jim Norton Opie one?  That was on the air though.  We didn't hide that.  That was done on the air.  Yeah, no shit.  That was on the air, man.  For an hour.  Unfortunately.  And I was that, did you hear how that hole, that fucking bitch during that last segment  was sitting there trying to, she goes, well, bye now.  That was me.  I fucking grew tits and my cock turned into a pussy in a second when these two started going  at it.  We went at it and we honestly thought it was like five minutes. 
[03:15:00]  Seriously.  Maybe seven minutes.  Someone goes, dude, you guys just went at it for 15 minutes.  It was 15 minutes.  I can't imagine that.  This wasn't a fucking joke.  It wasn't a bit.  I mean, serious.  Listen to me, fuck face.  I can't imagine that.  That kind of shit.  And I, all of a sudden, I was seven years old and my mommy and daddy were arguing and  the spaghetti hit the wall and went down the wall and I was watching it.  My father threw the spaghetti and I saw the sauce going down the wall. 
[03:15:30]  Same feeling.  I was like, stop it.  Stop.  Were you uncomfortable?  Oh.  All I think I said was something like, what did I say?  Holy shit.  I just went, oh, fuck.  Whatever.  It was like Spinal Tap where it was just, the two guys are arguing in the studio and then  the bass player and the drummer are in the behind the glass booth and they just go, oh,  this is all we fucking need.  Like they have no input on it and can't stop it. 
[03:16:00]  No.  That was me.  It was just like two brothers fighting though because everyone's like, then there was all  sorts of discussions like, that's the end of the show.  This is it.  This is going to break them all up.  And me and Jim talked and it was like, it took 10 seconds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even though we fought for almost an hour, it was 10 seconds.  Oh, you got it out.  I'm sorry too.  And that was it.  It's so fucked up because it started during a break and then we go back live and to just  do the show, you can do it.  But at that point it was impossible for these two. 
[03:16:30]  But it's also, it would have been so phony and forced.  It's like, we, I mean, look, we're not the most perfectly honest people.  We're fairly honest about what's going on.  We try to be as honest.  We try to be more honest than anyone else doing this dumb job.  It would have been a lie to have not just, it just bled into the thing.  Well, there's a, there's a degree of what's going on.  During breaks or before the show that you can then be a professional, you know, technically  a professional and get in and do your job.  Then if it passes that point, you're incapable of sitting and looking at that person and 
[03:17:00]  fucking, so let's do the story on the fucking chick that went to the strip club.  You know, you just look and go, Hey, motherfucker.  You know, you want to fucking punch you.  There are guys that can do that though.  There are guys that can fight like that and go right back into it.  Oh, it's like, Hey, how you doing?  That's why those shows are awful.  Well, yeah, those are one market sensations.  The best part of the fight in the middle of it, all of a sudden, Ant just went, Holy shit.  Yeah.  I just went, Holy shit. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, or, Oh, Holy shit.  Oh, well, you were alone in here.  Yeah.  It was done.  It was pretty much just, uh, like I was, I'd be the beginning.  I tried mediating something a little like guys, not during the show.  Let's, you know, right.  It's like, you know, this fucking guy, this shit.  It was like, all right, I'll step back.  I've been doing the show with Anthony for 12 years.  I think that was the first and only time I didn't even notice he was in the room.  I had no clue.  No clue.  He was here.  At one point, not even no clue that we were even broadcasting the thing.  And the way the fight went, it was your, your two tactics. 
[03:18:00]  It was like watching ultimate fighting where one's a grappler and one's just a fighter  because Opie was the, in your face, go fuck your mother, fuck you guy.  And Jimmy is the, oh, yeah, really, really, Opie, really.  Well, why don't you tell me like the, like I'm going to get him with intellect and sarcasm  and passive aggressive.  And to watch the two styles was really cool.  Wow.  I know. 
[03:18:30]  Cause the bull, bull bulldog, which would have been Opie.  Yep.  I don't know.  Jimmy was pretty tough, man.  You know, and then Jimmy would be the guy that steps to the side.  Right.  Steps to the side.  Let's have a good cell.  What were you working on there?  Which works for a while, but eventually the guy's going to catch you and he's going to kick your ass.  Jimmy worked me so bad.  I've never wanted to strangle someone so bad.  Oh, no.  I know.  You wanted to kill him.  I was like, I want to strangle this guy.  Oh, really?  It's just, oh, really?  Oh, why don't you tell me about it?  Why don't you, like turning everything around on Opie?  The worst thing you can do is use somebody's words against them. 
[03:19:00]  Right.  Nobody likes that.  No one likes that, you tool.  Awful.  I loved it.  Awful.  And then Stupid XM decided not to rerun the thing.  That wasn't our decision.  No, it was not our decision.  Did we ever talk about what happened after the fight?  I don't even remember.  See, Jimmy and I...  Elo was freaking out.  Oh, no, no, not that.  I mean, during the show.  Like, after that fight went on, then we went on with the show and making believe...  Not making believe, but then we...  I think I just talked to you and then Jimmy just talked to you.  And Jimmy and I always leak together.  Like, we have to leak every break. 
[03:19:30]  Every break.  And we usually are side by side, right?  So, you know, I got a leak.  He's got a leak.  And, you know, I'm not...  I have to leak no matter what.  So we walk into the bathroom.  Slam!  The door slams.  And then I go in.  Slam!  And then he goes into a stall.  Slam!  And then I go into a stall.  Slam!  We're just, like, talking by not talking.  Like, you motherfucker.  And we usually, like, just piss next to each other and have just a little...  A little chit-chat at the urinal.  A little show chat.  Right.  And then he's done with the stall. 
[03:20:00]  Slam!  I'm done!  Slam!  Out the door!  Slam!  Slam!  Oh, it's hilarious.  We had to do that for the rest of the show.  It was...  I remember Brandon Iron came in with a chick and we were watching porn.  And that kind of helped us because we had something to focus on that wasn't...  Oh, right.  So we were watching porn on the TV and kind of describing the porn we were watching,  which helped a little bit because it was something outside.  Yeah, great radio.  We were talking, actually, you know, we were talking, but doing what we could after that.  I mean, it was...  At that point, it was, yeah, sacrifice whatever's going out over the radio to just try to make 
[03:20:30]  peace in here.  Yeah.  Put on porno and let's describe it.  That was a few days before HBO's special.  Because I remember I was off.  I took two days off before I shot the special because I knew I was going to need...  I didn't want to wake up early.  I wanted to just relax and do that set.  And beforehand, we had announced that this is...  And it'll be even said at the end of that show, Jim won't be here Monday and Tuesday.  There's nothing going on that's uncomfortable, that's planned.  He's not supposed to be here because he's taken off of the HBO thing.  Other shows would play into that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, we didn't at all.  We did, seriously.  Oh, the speculation that was going on, though. 
[03:21:00]  And these guys still came to the shows and everything.  By the time you guys came, we had talked like two days later.  It was fine.  Oh, no.  We were fine before I went to the show.  Yeah.  Well, you get to shit out.  Thank God.  You get it out.  That would be a dick move if we didn't talk before you were...  Oh, yeah, no, we did.  Holy crap.  Oh, is that a good one?  It's anger leaving your body.  It gets out.  You fucking shit out.  That was a fun one.  Yeah, you called me a sandwich.  The one thing that hurt, Jimmy called me a sociopath, and I just kind of know it's  true.  Of course he did.  Why wouldn't you just use the obvious?  I know, that wasn't exactly reaching deep. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  I was just like, oh, man.  I'm sure Jim appreciated fuckface.  That hurt a lot.  Stupid man, I'm like, man, I didn't think you ever noticed that part of me before.  He really does know I'm a sociopath.  Yeah, there were some great lines to that one.  We got another one, Derek?  I think we're playing this one.  You guys might be on the same...  All right, cool.  Here's another one, Louie.  See, we go back to what we were doing.  Now we're back.  We were off the highway for a while, but now we're back on.  Turn back on.  One report from the Interfax News Agency says witnesses saw an explosion. 
[03:22:00]  Just before one of the crashes.  Both planes were Tupolev TU-154 jets.  That's a standard airliner on domestic flights in Russia.  The first crash happened in Bukhaki, about 110 miles south of Moscow.  Bukhaki?  Splattered the faces of all the people.  What is it about plane crashes and death that make anchors say cock and...  Cock.  Cunt.  Brokaw got away with it for years.  Yeah, he did. 
[03:22:30]  He couldn't even speak.  He couldn't.  And then he was giving us the news everywhere.  Yeah, that L thing where he couldn't really say his L.  Weird.  Got stuck in his throat.  Look, I can't use betting people how much you give me if I say cunt tonight.  A United Airlines 767 took off from cockfuck airport.  Oh, wait a minute.  It was...  Dork Liberty.  Sorry.  Well, we'll break by...  It all started with this Jane Skinner clip that's on YouTube.  Let's play it again as we go to break.  Oh, boy.  You going?  Huh?  Where are you going? 
[03:23:00]  Where are you going?  Where are you going, Rich?  What am I going on?  Oh, you're a little chill.  You have more audio to play.  You haven't talked in 15 minutes.  What's the matter with you?  All right?  Yeah, I'm good.  We're all talking.  All the guys are talking.  Talking, laughing.  You were telling that story.  It was an amazing story.  I didn't want to butt in at all.  That was a great...  You know...  Open up your hands.  Just once.  Oh, they're just awful.  They're awful hands.  All right.  Yeah, we go to break with this clip again.  I'm involved here.  Hey, we got some DICE audio?  Oh, yeah.  If there's anyone that wants to tap out, I understand. 
[03:23:30]  Don't want to drag anyone else into our bullshit, but some interesting audio.  Yeah.  And we'll play that next, but first, this clip.  The deputy police chief says six officers were killed, including the district's top cock.  Top cock after a cop after the vehicle they were riding in was sprayed with bullets.  Three other officers were hurt in the attack.  And those are your latest headlines.  I'm Jane Skinner.  Time to send you back to Shepard, who is live where?  It's outside of Memphis. 
[03:24:00]  South Carolina Gamecocks.  She's a big fan.  Go, South Carolina.  Do you know how hard it is to read when everyone else in the studio is shaking with laughter at your mission?  I know.  I've been there, Jane.  You too, me.  It's been worse for many, many billions of times.  Wow.  It's Friday, Jane.  No one's watching.  They're out doing things.  It's just me, you, and Dorell and down in the distance.  That's it.  We'll look for you on YouTube there, Jane.

[03:25:00]  We're back.  Stomachers.  I hope it's not that powder I'm taking at me.  Back it.  In the New York room.  Oh, oh, oh.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  I'm obsessed with Ace Frehley.  I have to meet him.  Why?  I'm obsessed.  You have to meet him?  What do you mean?  No, meet him.  He's the only member of a kiss I haven't met. 
[03:25:30]  I'm obsessed with him.  Oh, we met him.  Oh.  That powder that makes your shit.  What, cocaine?  You know that you're about 5,000 times more important than him now.  It does.  No, I want to meet Ace.  You should want to meet you.  Exactly.  People actually come to see you now.  Celebrities never want to meet me.  They don't care about me.  I'm a hole in the donut.  Edward Norton.  Erin Moran.  Oh, yeah.  She was a big Lucky Louie fan.  Joni from Happy Days.  Oh, really?  Her and her husband, I went to a signing, and they're like, are you that guy from Lucky  Louie?  And I got a picture with him, and they wanted a picture with me. 
[03:26:00]  Wow.  I'm a big fan of Lucky Louie.  Her husband, Chachi?  No.  No.  Charles Arcola wasn't there.  Oh, I thought.  They were divorced.  Remember, he was molesting children.  I forgot about that episode.  Very special.  Happy Days.  Wait, what?  That was the happiest of all days.  Yes, where Chachi, where Donnie Most had a nephew, and Chachi fingered its ass in the  booth at Al's, and then Arnold went, quiet.  I forgot that one. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Mmm.  Joni.  Yogurt.  Don't I am me, people.  Don't I am.  Here's what I get.  Hi.  Because then my screen fills up with I am's.  That's it.  So I've warned people, now I have to bounce you.  Oh, my stomach hurts.  Wait, so you're taking that powder?  Aloe cleanse?  Yeah, I don't know if that's it, though.  I might not be making my stomach hurt.  It could just be, uh...  I hear the powder is awful.  It tastes terrible.  I made an ass of myself with Ed Norton once.  What'd you do?  Ed, yes. 
[03:27:00]  He came into the cellar to see Jeff Ross, because...  Oh, okay.  He's putting him in a movie or something.  Ah, so Jimmy, what happened?  So Jimmy...  I was busy.  You, I thought...  Oh, because he didn't get the movie part?  Well, his big thing is Edward Norton, his good friend, comes down to see him.  Yes.  At the cellar.  He was there recently, too.  Apparently, he goes down and sees a lot of comics and puts some of them in movies.  Yeah, but who knows what the movie's about?  He could need an old Walter Matthau-looking man, and that's why Jeff was hired.  Perfect for the part.  But so Jeff went on, and he did, you know, he did his set, and then I went on after him, 
[03:27:30]  and Norton stayed in the room.  And I just killed.  I had a great set.  And so him and Jeff were hanging out in a booth upstairs afterwards, and I just...  I don't even care who Ed Norton is, but he's a celebrity, and I just part of him just  wants him to say something nice.  So I kind of started standing around their booth, looking like I'm doing things I'm  not doing, hoping that he's going to go, hey, hey, you were awesome.  And I just didn't get any play.  I kept trying to get in his line of sight.  It was fucking pathetic. 
[03:28:00]  It was fucking pathetic.  Oh, you poor bastard.  Totally helpless to those feelings.  I don't know what made me do it.  And then finally, I just fucking walked past their booth, which wasn't like the comics  booth.  It was very out of my way, looking like, oh, I'm leaving out this way anyway, and said  goodbye to Jeff.  Hey, Jeff, see you later.  I never would say goodbye to Jeff Ross on the way out of a...  Oh, I got to say goodbye to Jeff Ross.  I can't let him...  In a million years, I wouldn't say goodbye to him.  I fucking almost don't like him.  And then...  And then Norton...  So I say goodbye to Jeff, and then I finally just look him right in the fucking face 
[03:28:30]  and force him to...  He goes, hey, it was good.  It was good.  And then continues talking to him.  Oh, wow.  Because he just...  You made him give you a compliment.  I made him.  Oh, my God.  I made him either tell me to fuck off.  I gave him a choice between tell me to fuck off or tell me I did a good job.  Barely.  Sounds like he gave you a little of both.  A little of both.  Yeah, yeah.  He did.  Good, good.  Get the fuck out of here.  Fucking useless.  You want so much validation.  The other night, we're doing a benefit, and Robert Klein was headlining, but he's in the  audience.  I'm going, oh, great, man.  I'm going on right before him. 
[03:29:00]  He'll watch me.  You know, and I'll go, he'll watch me.  I'll go, it'll be great.  I'll try to kill, and Robert Klein, who's a legend, will come up.  Yeah.  So I'm on stage, and right before I go up, the owner drags Robert Klein out of the room  to talk to him about something, and I just wanted to kill him.  Robert Klein's wife is sitting there, however, and I'm looking to see if he's laughing and  maybe try to get a compliment through her.  Yeah.  My wife is in a trip.  Robert Klein's wife.  I know.  You are trying to get compliments from his wife. 
[03:29:30]  That's being anointed, Robert Klein's wife.  Yeah, that's a big moment.  It doesn't get any better than that.  That's like Johnny Carson's three ring sign, heaven no.  Robert Klein's wife noticed that you're on stage.  That's good.  Wow.  All right.  Why don't we get this Dice audio on?  What is this exactly?  Is this a problem with one of our fans?  Yeah, we had the pests.  A bunch of pests, just giving them shit.  A few pests went to one of his gigs.  Yeah.  Yeah, it'll happen.  For Louis C.K.  Dice was a really good friend of the show, and for whatever reason, we still don't know. 
[03:30:00]  For a while.  He decided to turn on us bad.  We got fired.  We were off for a couple of years.  During that couple of years, I do believe Opie actually went out to L.A., hung out with  him.  Went to the gym.  No bad blood.  Went to the gym with him and did 10-pound curls with him, because that's how it worked  out.  What you do now?  The most bizarre thing ever.  I'm like, Dice, it's too light.  He goes, no, no, no.  Just do it 100 times.  Why?  It was 10-pound curls. 
[03:30:30]  Gives you a definition.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah, so there was no bad blood or anything, and then we get back on the air.  Hung out in his apartment after he got kicked out of his house.  Went shopping with him.  Him in a shopping cart.  Gave you tips on decorating your apartment.  You mean you put them in the cart like you put a kid in there?  Yeah.  Might as well have, but he's, mommy, I want the sweet cereal.  He's dressed as Dice with a shopping cart in a supermarket.  It was pretty hilarious, actually.  Did he have to be dazzled? 
[03:31:00]  I hung out with him a few nights ago.  I never met him.  Yeah.  And at the comedy store, I saw him.  He went on after me at the comedy store.  He's a million times funnier as the stand-up than he was when he was big.  I never got him.  I never thought that was funny.  Yeah.  The Dice thing.  But now he's just a guy talking, and it's fucking funny.  But anyway, I hung out afterwards.  I talked to him.  He's a nice guy.  I liked him.  I mean, I don't know.  I have no idea what's going on.  Yeah, no, it's fine.  But he was very gorgeous.  We thought he was a nice guy, too.  That's how he was.  That's how he'd been.  I mean, for years, that's how he'd been.  We had a great time.  Did some great shows.  Some of the best shows ever. 
[03:31:30]  And then something happened.  Yeah.  We still don't know.  No.  I turned around.  Started bad-mouthing us.  Mm-hmm.  For no fucking reason.  No real reason.  Weird.  He won't talk to you and say,  Nah, it's fine.  Whatever.  He could call the show anytime.  He knows the numbers.  Go ahead.  If he had a problem, he could have called.  Pass it out on the air.  How it should be done.  So, he was doing a show, and, you know, our past, they're just terrific.  Ruthless. 
[03:32:00]  So, I guess in the middle of Dice's set, the past, we're giving it to him pretty good,  where Dice just, like, exploded on stage.  Oh, no.  Throwing up on your own feet, another fucking zero.  I don't give a fuck.  He says another fucking zero because I heard, and you know we're pretty honest here,  I heard at this particular show he ate his balls.  He ate his balls.  He was not having a good time up there and not a good set.  Where was this?  And so, I guess the pests were jumping up one after another, and that's where this  tape begins with another whatever. 
[03:32:30]  Wait, what was this?  I don't know where this one was.  Connecticut.  Connecticut?  Was it Connecticut?  The audio's from Saturday night.  Oh.  So, it's this past Saturday night?  Yeah.  And I guess this was broadcast on the other...  Oh, it was?  I think so, yeah.  Doggy Channel?  Is this a show he did with Artie?  I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He told me about this.  What'd he say?  He told me that there were six fistfights during this show. 
[03:33:00]  There were literally six fistfights during this show.  Just for full disclosure, I'm working with Dice in Albany in December.  We're doing a gig today.  That's all right.  We'll make it perfectly clear that this isn't Louis C.K.'s battle.  Don't worry about it.  No, no.  He's a guy I just met and like.  And you'll be doing a show with him soon.  But, yeah.  I'll probably get heckled there and find whatever.  There were six fistfights?  That's what he said, yeah.  And this particular guy was getting dragged out as Dice was giving him the business.  Mm-hmm.  And they were just popping up one after another.  Oh, and they passed boink, boink, boink, boink, boink. 
[03:33:30]  Like at the Republican convention?  Yeah.  Giving Dice shit.  Four more years.  Which he pretty much deserved, so.  And Dice couldn't take it finally.  Throwing up on your own feet, but not a fucking zero.  I don't give a fuck.  It's a serious radio.  We know what the fuck we want, but we want to fucking do it.  Howard Stern's at home fucking listening.  Because we've got a couple fucking lanes in the crowd, maybe listening in.  Oh, I'm a pest from the ONA joke. 
[03:34:00]  Now you're a pest outside in your own fucking vomit.  Choke on it, you prick.  Whoa.  They're not with him on it, the crowd.  Whoa.  Huh?  The crowd's not with him.  No, I don't think so at all.  I, uh.  There's some cheers in there, absolutely.  I don't know what was going on there.  Wow.  I guess a couple of pests got a little rambunctious.  And we love it.  Absolutely love it.  This is a weird half side of comedy, of stand-up, this whole world.  Yeah.  I mean, you guys and them, and everybody, like how you pack theaters, like gym shows, you 
[03:34:30]  know, just these people are fucking nuts.  I mean, your fans are crazy.  Oh, I know, they're fucking psychopaths.  They show appreciation in a weird way.  They lunatics.  Yeah, they'll kill them.  You're funny, you fucking asshole!  Just screaming and...  Oh, that was Hampton Beach Casino.  Oh, controlling a mob.  Such a weird way to do stand-up.  Uh, let's see.  Okay, this guy was at the show.  Mike, New Hampshire, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I was at the show on Saturday night. 
[03:35:00]  I, uh, went up there to see Artie.  I know, I know.  I'm a big fan of you guys.  But I had to see Artie.  I liked that dirty work and whatnot.  And, uh, Dice got up there and got fucking torn apart.  It was unbelievable.  How was, uh...  Unbelievable.  So, how long into the show did all this stuff happen?  This happened, well, Artie was supposed to be the headliner.  He got up there for 25 minutes.  Call back, dude.  Your phone crapped out.  Your phone.  We're losing you.  Let's say hi to Diana. 
[03:35:30]  Deanna, California, what's up?  Hey.  Um, remember, Louie, when you did the special, um, for XM, like, I don't know, a couple months ago?  Oh, the one I did in D.C.?  Yeah, and the stupid drunk guy was heckling you?  Yeah, yeah.  And, well, I'm from that town.  I'm from Hagerstown.  Mm-hmm.  And I just wanted to tell you that we're not all like that.  And that I love you.  And thank you, though, for wanting to play that one.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, and I saw Dice the other night on VH1. 
[03:36:00]  He was, I guess, plugging his bit on this.  There's a black girl that has a show.  Wendy Williams.  Yeah, he was on there.  And he was, like, arguing with his little fag, or her little fag assistant.  It was just funny.  I think it was, he was doing a show on VH1, and then he went on VH1 to plug the show.  So, it was just funny.  See, now he doesn't have you guys.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[03:36:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Boy, she sounds a lot different when she's being tased.  Yeah.  She sounds more interesting.  When she's boring people.  Wow.  Your voice changes when you get tased.  Yeah.  Way to spin a yarn.  Oh, my God.  Way to rivet a nation.  I like when they stick it for their town.  We're not all, we're not all drunk losers.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, that guy was a fucking drip.  All right, we got a contest announcement.  A drip.  What?  A contest announcement.  Ooh.  Oh, boy. 
[03:37:00]  It's the O&A Video Contest, sponsored by HotMovies.com.  Let's see how this works.  It starts today?  It starts today.  It starts today, officially.  It will end on December 15th.  Grand prize, $1,000, courtesy of HotMovies.com.  It's an O&A-themed video contest.  All right.  Original videos or animation, no more than three minutes each.  Submitted via email, VHS, DVD.  Wait, wait.  If somebody comes and submits a VHS tape, I am going to go to their house and shove it 
[03:37:30]  up their ass.  There is no way VHS should be in our vocabulary anymore.  It's the dumbest.  Voss, you have a VHS, right?  Beta.  Beta, Max?  Yeah.  All right.  You know what?  I got to go back to the Dice thing, because people are just dumb.  TJ from Jersey.  Ope, maybe Dice hates you because you never called him back after he tried to call you  after your father died.  Oh, really?  Well, he had fun talking about my father and my dead dad's skull on Howard's show, so go 
[03:38:00]  fuck yourself, first of all, TJ.  Second of all, I wasn't talking to many people after my dad died.  Sorry.  Yeah, maybe you need a little time to mow things over.  That's a weird reason to get mad at somebody.  Right.  Yeah.  Sorry.  His father dies and he gets all fucking snotty.  Yeah.  Well, what happened?  Sorry that I kept to myself and actually had no desire to even do radio for the first six  months when we got on XM.  So, he takes that that I didn't call him after my father died.  He didn't want to go to Pips.  Got so pissed off that he still didn't call our show, then starts bad-mouthing us, and 
[03:38:30]  then goes on Howard, even though he's going to call me about my father because he knew  that crushed me, and then starts discussing how he's going to fuck my dead dad's skull.  Right?  Fuck you, TJ.  Fuck you.  Also, Jimmy, no comment about Dice.  Still friends with him or figuring you could hop on his coattails?  Well, that's true.  No, to be honest with you, I haven't talked to Andrew once in the last two years.  I never lie about what happened to me and him.  He just booted me off the tour of me and him in Florentine while we were off the air.  And I hated that it happened like that. 
[03:39:00]  And then he didn't come on the show, and I saw him once when I was out in L.A., and  we talked for like an hour, and that's when I was out there shooting Lucky Louie, and  we hadn't talked since.  Yeah, Dice does stupid things, and there's no real explanation for it.  I have no personal issue with Dice.  I just don't like him anymore because no one else does.  I'm a bandwagon jumper.  There's no reason to be ashamed of that.  He actually said something.  Well, other folks were going that way, so I figured that sounds good to me.  And I said, I'm going to be with all them because I want to be like everybody else. 
[03:39:30]  Well, I admire those people, and they're doing it.  I'm going to do what they do.  I'm getting on the bandwagon.  He actually had some dumb stuff to say about you, too.  Of course he does.  He's a douchebag.  O&A-themed video contest.  Original videos or animation, no more than three minutes each.  Submitted via email, VHS tape, DVD that are centered around the cast and crew of the O&A show.  And details are on opianthony.com.  So we're going to host the videos on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[03:40:00]  Can they use clips from the show?  Yeah.  Can they use video from the show that has found its way to various locations online?  Huh?  You mean can they edit?  Huh?  Well, no.  Let's say they go to a lot of these video sites and pick and choose certain clips and  then edit them together in a humorous fashion.  With some commentary voiceover. 
[03:40:30]  Right.  Voiceover music.  Things like that.  Superimposed penises going in your mouths.  Right.  That kind of thing.  Here's the winning submission right now.  I'm just going to give it out.  What if they take us, a video, put it in fast motion, and put the Benny Hill music behind  it?  Oh, fucking Jesus.  Now I just gave out the winning one.  I just fucked the whole contest.  There you go.  Well, videos will be judged on originality, humor, relevance to the O&A show.  So get it where you can.  Sponsored by hotmovies.com. 
[03:41:00]  Well, like the Dragon Wagon clip's a perfect example.  When Jimmy went after that Dragon Wagon guy and the kid animated it, it's getting massive  views on all the websites.  Yeah, if you know Flash Animation, you're autistic.  Newsground, whatever.  Got to be 18 and older.  It's sponsored by hotmovies.com.  All right.  Really fast.  TJ's writing back.  Ope, I wasn't calling you out, just stating a point that you guys talked about earlier  previously when you talked about Dice and him hating you.  Okay.  And then we got David Jones from MS. 
[03:41:30]  Where is that?  MS is Mississippi or Mississippi?  Multiple sclerosis.  Mississippi.  Wow, Ope's touchy when someone in his family dies.  It's fucking comedy gold when it happens to someone else.  No laugh track, Ope.  Hey, guys, my dad died in a fiery car accident.  That's horrific.  That's horrific.  There you go, Dan.  Now what?  Now what?  Ass.  I feel queasy.  You all right?  I like how they got backed off.  People always...  I get emails sometimes from people... 
[03:42:00]  Like on MySpace, people write me messages, and I read all of them.  But I answer close to zero.  Because I do.  I have kids, and I work.  You're a busy guy.  And also, that's not interesting to do.  I don't do it.  Answering all of them.  So sometimes the only ones I answer are people that say,  Hey, asshole, I've written you three times.  You won't answer.  You don't care about your fans.  I'm no longer your fan.  I hate you, you piece of shit.  So I write back, and I say, Well, I'm busy.  And if you don't like me because of that, fuck you.  And then they always write back and go, I totally wasn't trying to... 
[03:42:30]  Man.  You know, I just totally...  No.  No.  I made up this one thing that I keep on my clipboard, on my notepad,  that I can just take off, copy, and paste when people really bash me.  And it's a real...  Like, I've got to pull it up.  It's a real kind of generic stamped response.  Like, that's all I give.  It's like, Thank you so much for supporting the program.  Thank you for your interest in Anthony.  We really appreciate it here at the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:43:00]  Like, I just slam him with that.  He took all this time to write what a dickhead I am and how unfunny the show is.  And fuck.  And I just send him this generic thing.  Just let him know that they're going on a pile.  Like, they're adding to a number.  Thank you.  We are happy to get emails.  Didn't read your fucking letter.  I just sent this off.  Fuck you.  You know what?  You told us, and I tried that one time, and then I didn't get enough satisfaction.  I have to fight with him.  Yeah, you're crazy.  Never.  You fight.  I could never do that. 
[03:43:30]  You get into message board wars.  That's crazy.  That's just...  I just write...  I hit the message board, but usually it's one post where it's just like,  Oh, fuck all he is.  Yeah.  And that's it.  Oh, sorry, dude.  I like the message boards for the most part, but...  There are bits we do that are so obviously just great.  We know.  Greatness.  No, I'm serious.  And then you go on the message board, and 95% of the people, they're with you.  Yeah, that was obviously those guys doing comedy gold, what have you.  Then you get these asses. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  That's what you get.  It's either...  Because they want to be...  It's either...  You got to take...  Comedy is either very subjective.  Some people aren't going to like the funniest thing in the world.  Some people just aren't going to like.  And the other thing is, some people just want to be too cool for the room.  Like, you know...  Well, also, Americans aren't...  They're consumers when it comes to like movies or anything.  It's not like there's art that they're appreciating and then thinking of or absorbing.  They think they're their customer.  Like, I didn't get my thing I like.  Yeah, well, then fuck you. 
[03:44:30]  I'm not satisfied.  Yeah.  This isn't the best breakfast I ever had.  Did you bring your manager?  Brad.  Yeah, but they're so arrogant when they tell you how to do your job that you've been doing forever.  You know?  You know what?  Go up during the check spot in front of 300 drunks.  All right, man?  You're dirty.  Go fuck yourself.  That's why on the show, we beg the message boards to eat their own.  Just eat your own.  You know who the problems are.  You know they have nothing to contribute.  That they're not official fans of the show. 
[03:45:00]  Just eat your own.  The thing is, the survival in this shit is just cut and dry.  If you're not good, nobody will listen and you'll stop being on the air.  It'll take care of itself.  There won't be message boards about you or your shows or anything like that.  But there's bits we do we know.  Some will like and some whatever.  But then there are those bits.  It's like, if you're a fan, you call yourself a fan of the show, you're going to love it.  But then you get these idiots like, ah, yeah.  You're never going to make everyone happy.  It's just the way it is.  Ron and Fez do this thing, message board gossip. 
[03:45:30]  I was listening to it yesterday.  And I guess Steve put together the intro to it.  Yeah.  If that's on the fucking dilette, you got to hear it.  This is some more Steve awfulness.  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  It's hard.  Really fast.  I said I didn't feel like talking when my dad died.  Yeah.  You know, first six months of XM was a little rough for me.  We discussed that in the past.  Well, this guy put on his cell phone.  Hey, Hope, you didn't feel like talking when your dad died?  I didn't know your dad died the day before you were on Letterman. 
[03:46:00]  Sorry.  Oh, see, you know.  Hey, man, that's funny.  He's even gone.  Let's go to Andrew in Brooklyn.  Andrew.  Hey, how's it going?  I just wanted to defend you, Opie.  Yeah.  When the guy from Don and Mike's, his wife died, you know, you guys didn't trash him.  We didn't even touch that.  Of course not.  Yeah, I know.  There are things you just don't fuck with.  There are things that are serious and, you know, and then the things you just don't fuck with that.  It's too real. 
[03:46:30]  It's too close to home.  It's too...  It definitely surpasses any radio war bullshit.  Radio war is pretty low on the fucking ladder of importance in life when, you know, you're stricken with something.  Are you all right, Jimmy?  Is Jimmy throwing up?  He said his...  He is throwing up.  He said his stomach hurt because of some powder he was taking to make him shit.  Oh, my God.  That is authentic.  Oh, no.  You've got a real problem.  Jimmy is vomiting into the ash pan. 
[03:47:00]  What happened, Jimmy?  I just made myself puke.  I feel queasy.  You just made yourself puke?  Yeah.  You stuck your fingers...  Just right over there by all the people?  Like, you couldn't go to the fucking toilet?  I thought that was, like, emergency.  Yeah, so did I.  That was like, hey, let me do this for a second.  Did stuff come up?  A little bit, but not that much.  I don't know if it's a powder or not.  It might just have a stomach bug.  I like that sound.  Well, at least we all got to watch fucking Brown come out of your mouth.  Oh, bile.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  They don't do this on Sean Hannity's talk show. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Unless they're liberals.  They're probably doing it today.  Who won?  Who won?  Oh, no.  All right.  What are we doing?  They have the Ron and Fez thing in.  I got to leave right at 11 today.  Oh, no.  It's a quick jingle.  All right.  It's just a jingle-type intro to the segment.  I'm looking at houses again.  And it's Steve.  I got to take a look.  He goes, razzle-dazzle.  Listen to the way he says razzle-dazzle. 
[03:48:00]  Razzle-dazzle.  It's Borg Gossip with Eastside Dave.  A little gossip, a little gossip.  That's it.  Razzle-dazzle.  I heard that yesterday.  I couldn't get it out of my fucking head.  I wanted to punch Steve in the face with that razzle-dazzle.  There he is.  Steve.  That's going to let me out of my fucking head.  That is so bad. 
[03:48:30]  What's wrong?  Razzle-dazzle.  I think I must have cut that three months ago.  I have no idea what happens to these lines after Dave asks for them.  He just says how he wants it said.  He says, all right, I just need a real happy razzle-dazzle.  And I have no idea where it's going after that.  Well, it stunk.  Could you say razzle-dazzle like there's a cock right by your chin?  Exactly.  That was really the motivation.  Thanks, Jim.  Razzle-dazzle.  I just try to imagine male genitalia hanging somewhere near my face and it comes out like that. 
[03:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  You're welcome.  Did I really say this once?  What did you say?  Gordy from Connecticut.  Opie had the best line of all time.  Opie once stated that Dana Reeves died because an angel was tired of wiping Christopher Reeves' ass.  I don't remember being that.  What?  I don't remember saying that.  Wow.  Like the angel said, get her up here.  Yeah, I'm sad.  I'm tired of this fucking dude.  Wow.  He's an adult.  I shouldn't be doing this.  No. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  With Christopher Reeves in heaven, wouldn't he have legs that worked?  I also like that you think shit in heaven.  Yeah.  So much stuff just doesn't make sense.  Let's go to Ken in Florida.  Ken.  Hey, boys.  Love you.  Hey, I want your side.  I believe you.  I love you guys.  But now I heard Dice through audio on the internet that he says you scream to his kid and that's  why he's pissed off.  I want to get your side, man.  I love you guys.  I'm out.  Scream at his kid?  No.  What he's referring to is when he was playing Madison Square Garden, which we pretty much 
[03:50:00]  promoted to the point where we got people in the seats, even though the Yankees and  Mets were in the World Series.  Game five.  Game five.  That was a great time to do a fucking nice job.  But we still got people in Madison Square Garden for Dice.  Yeah.  I'm sure we can find the audio.  He thanks us and says, if it wasn't for you guys, this wouldn't happen.  It was a dream come true that I could do this in front of my kids again, blah, blah,  blah.  He came down and there was an entourage and Dice was basically telling us that he invited  Mancow to the show. 
[03:50:30]  And Mancow was on TV pretty much promoting that he was the one bringing Dice to New York  City to the Garden.  Yeah.  It was ONA Presents.  But Mancow was trying to take credit for this whole Dice at the Garden because Dice used  to do his show as well.  So we lost it with Dice.  And now Dice is trying to claim, even though we did the show after that and we continue  to be friends, he continued doing the radio show.  Yeah.  Nothing happened then.  When we got fired, I was out in L.A. a bunch of times hanging out with him. 
[03:51:00]  That is what he's claiming is the reason why he hates me because I yelled at his kids.  It just didn't happen.  Well, that's bullshit because after the Garden, he did a beacon and he was throwing it in  here.  It just didn't happen.  Everything was still fine and dandy.  He would bring his kid in a lot.  So the only thing I can tell you is maybe when Ant and I, because Ant was part of this  too because we were out of our minds, that all of a sudden Mancow A was going to show  up at the Garden show.  We hated him for the shit he was saying about us.  You know, we were going at it with Dice on the show live.  And if his kid was in the area, that's the only thing I can think of. 
[03:51:30]  Imagine if every relationship you had in your life was the other people, the person was  on the radio.  Like a radio war, yeah.  I mean, any relationship would turn into that.  Everyone.  Because everybody on the planet Earth that has any relationship with anybody says, you  know, when they walk away from me, oh, you fucking cunt, I hate him.  I mean, everybody.  Yeah.  You know, your wife, your kid, everybody goes like, okay, great, see you later, you fucking  cunt.  So if everybody in the world went on to their own separate radio shows after talking to  each other and then just started talking about it, that's why radio, you get the radio wars. 
[03:52:00]  That's why.  Because people can't just get on the air and keep their mouths shut.  No.  Yeah, I met that guy, he said this, what a fucking asshole, that, and then he gets on,  these guys are fucking douchebag.  No, the default human relationship is animosity.  Yeah.  Covered by politeness.  That's why the radio has so much power.  This jackass cop gave me a ticket for no reason the other night.  I go, do you listen to ONA?  He goes, yeah.  I go, I'm going to trash you.  And he got happy that I was...  Really?  You didn't mention me?  Yeah.  I have no jackass cops.  Didn't he recognize your name? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, but...  But what?  But I just want to make this perfectly clear.  Our side of the story, that was the only time we actually had a real fight with Dice,  because it was like, what are you doing, man?  We hate Man Cow, and he's going to come down and be at the garden show after we just helped  you promote this for last night?  Yeah, if he wanted to go to Chicago and sell out a show over there, then let him fucking  hook up with Man Cow there.  We wouldn't give a shit about that.  Right.  That's one thing, and this is God's honest.  We don't care who goes on what show.  Doesn't fucking matter.  We know you, especially comics, have to plug their gigs. 
[03:53:00]  They want the biggest audience there is.  So if you guys are playing, and especially if it's a market we're not even in, I mean,  who gives a shit what shows you go on to plug your gigs?  Same thing with little actors, actresses.  Why should we care if they're plugging their movie on another radio show?  Some people, they don't want you fucking going on other shows.  We've been cock-blocked a thousand fucking times, and we could give a shit whose show  anyone else goes on.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  What was Howard saying? 
[03:53:30]  Something about Otto and George?  I don't know.  I didn't hear any of the audio.  Because of the FHM thing?  Apparently, because Otto and George is prominently featured in our FHM article this month, and  he said something like, oh, what, he's over with their camp now?  Like, it's a camp.  Like, anyone cares?  Do whatever you gotta do to promote what the fuck you do in life.  It's not gonna matter to me.  I could give a shit.  But just to end it, so then after that argument we had with Dice, we ended up staying friends  for a long time after that with never another altercation, ever. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah.  Nothing with me yelling at his kids.  It's just a flat-out lie.  To not yell at Dice's kids.  No, no one yelled at his kids.  Why would you yell at his kids?  Why would you?  Like, what reason could there be to yell at his kids?  Put a booger on the couch.  All right.  If that ever happened, I would have to yell and then throw away the couch.  I believe he's got mental problems.  You know, I gotta say, he's nuts.  He's just fucking nuts.  I don't think you'd be alone thinking that, talking to people that know him.  That's coming from me.  He's nuts. 
[03:54:30]  Sponsored by BodogFight.com.  We're talking about line of the day.  Yes.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout against  the Russians.  It's all on BodogFight.com.  A mixed martial arts tournament and docu-reality unlike any seen before.  I must crush you.  We got a couple runner-up lines of the day and then the winner, of course.  Here's the first runner-up.  No, I call my girl Mother when I'm having sex with her.  Mother?  Mother blood!  I'll actually call her by my mother's maiden name. 
[03:55:00]  I go with Granny myself.  Grandma.  Nana.  Oh, God damn.  It's even worse, though, if you only go from behind and you call her Pop-Pop.  Oh, Pop-Pop.  Jimmy Norton.  Very good, Jimmy.  Line of the day.  No, it's runner-up.  Runner-up.  Here's the other runner-up line of the day.  Oh, there's another runner-up.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Rich.  He has an apology for Louis C.K.  Rich Voss.  Rich in New Hampshire. 
[03:55:30]  I have an apology for everybody.  He has an apology for XM Canada and...  Oh, go ahead, Rich.  Outside a toilet stall with a mouthful of Pollywogs.  I made runner-up.  How could that not be line of the day?  That's pretty great.  You guys found a better one than that today?  That's all right.  I accept their judgment.  Well, Dan?  Well, no, voting's anonymous.  I'm bloop single guy.  Dan's not happy with the winner.  Oh, really?  I can tell.  This should be the winner.  I thought when Dan said that, there's no way that's going to be beat.  I'll agree with you. 
[03:56:00]  Well, let's see what the winner is.  Yeah.  Yeah, Louis C.K.'s in there like, I know which one it is.  Here's line of the day.  Oh.  Danny, you suck.  Danny sucks.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Razzle dazzle.  Really?  All right, they're trying to make a funny bit out of it. 
[03:56:30]  Wow.  The boys behind the scenes trying to make it funny.  Wow, they're trying to be funny.  Okay.  Whose idea was that?  There was one person.  No one.  Two people don't automatically go, let's do this.  One person came up with that idea.  Who was it?  You guys might have just wrecked the line of the day bit.  It was fucking Travis.  Travis, you actually thought that was funny.  You thought we were going to like laugh.  Ah, look.  Line of the day is just Steve saying razzle dazzle. 
[03:57:00]  You just took a winner from Anthony.  Why would you make a bit out of the bit?  Oh, no, no, no.  I said in jest, that should just be line of the day.  Yeah.  Everyone laughed and said yes, and then we said we'll play that, and then we'll play the real one.  Wow, see, now he's smearing it around the responsibility.  Oh, wait, there's a real one after that?  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that wasn't line of the day?  No, that was just...  Oh, we're all dicks then, sorry.  Go back to your post.  That was a funny one.  We're all assholes, sorry.  I still don't know how fucking Pollywogs are to win.  Wow, we still don't get it. 
[03:57:30]  It was just an opportunity to make fun of Steve one last time and then do the real line of the day.  Okay.  Well, I think that's just hurtful.  All right.  Maybe it's only funny to girls.  I don't know.  Steve's saying razzle dazzle is fucking...  No wonder I threw up.  Here's the official line of the day.  I have to literally scrape shit.  Out of my daughter's little red vagina.  A few times a day.  A few times a day.  Oh, my God.  Gotta get in there with the wipey, make a corner out of it, and get the shit out of it. 
[03:58:00]  Holy fuck.  Every time she takes a shit, it goes straight up her gun.  That's true.  That's true.  That is a good one.  That's hard.  You know something?  It's something you're rarely here to.  And that was actually on 3FM and it didn't get dumped.  Louie, you killed for us.  Sorry, it got a little weird near the end there.  No.  Show got a little weird at the end, but...  That always does.  Stupid show.  And Louie, what?  Next weekend, we'll be in the Vegas Comedy Festival. 
[03:58:30]  The Comedy Festival.  Or louisck.com.  I'm at the Vegas.  Me and Dave Attell together with Daniel Tosh also.  That's a great show, man.  Yeah, it should be good.  Yeah.  You got to stay in touch and it's not by any time, man.  Absolutely.  Thank you, guys.  A lot of fun.  Thanks.  Absolutely.  And Jimmy, where are you?  Hammerstein Ballroom, Friday night.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  I feel better since I puke.  Do you?  Yeah.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  I only got a little bit out.  It wasn't the food.  It was the food.  I like how you were throwing up as Steve was talking. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah.  Just who listens to him.  I just want to shut up.  Hammerstein Ballroom, Friday night.  And Ticketmaster.  It would be a good show.  I have a lot of new filth.  All right.  And the inimitable Rich Fox.  Sweetie.  Helium Comedy Club, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Philly.  Helium Comedy Club.  I don't know how you made yourself throw it with just one finger when you're used to taking  I can't believe you do it in the room with people.  The whole point of a bathroom is that you fucking put your waste products in another area. 
[03:59:30]  Rich, just because yours don't go past your front teeth.  Exactly.  He's trying to make a cock gagging joke.  No, I wasn't.  Yes, you were.  You were.  I was saying how you didn't go into the bathroom.  Yes, you were.  No, you said because he's used to taking a little more in his mouth.  Can you just let it pass?  It's the end of the day.  No.  Could you just let it go?  Never.  You just had it?  I gave you a great compliment today.  I said that you're great on a stage.  Thank you.  Fuck it.  I did my job.  Yeah, fuck.  He is.  He's funny.  Breathe some of that fart in.  That's a putrid fart I just dropped.  Oh, no. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, then I want the fuck out of here.  I want to see my girlfriend and give her the old Dutch oven.  I am not going to.  You got a new girlfriend?  I have to clear the path like a machete through the fucking car.  Look at Anthony.  Hacking with me.  We all have problems on this show.  Have you noticed yet, Louie?  Louie's noticed.  That's why he wants to hang out here.  Then you need the Purell.  You got to Purell up a little bit.  And then you got...  And talking about cleaning all the germs in his house and we're all looking at each other.  Yeah, this is fucking normal.  One stupid booger. 
[04:00:30]  No, we could all relate.  It was a child booger.  You obviously never lived in a fraternity house.  Yeah, thank God I didn't have to shove marshmallows up my ass and walk 10 yards.  I had a guy that would sleep naked on the couch at my fraternity and he would be so wasted  and then he would...  You could fuck him and he wouldn't know it.  No, he would...  No?  He would splatter shit on the walls.  Jesus.  He would have the explosive diarrhea while he was passed out in the living room on one  of those fucking flea-infested couches.  This is a true story.  All right.  Let's be honest.  His name, Greg O.B.D. 
[04:01:00]  It was a big fat guy, Jerry.  I forgot his last name, but...  True story.  True story.  Yeah, he's just...  Explosive diarrhea all over the walls from this guy and, you know, completely passed down  naked.  I have an explosive diarrhea.  I don't get worried about a booger.  Was he a member of the fraternity or he just hung out?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You couldn't throw him out.  You guys went to college?  I'm a legacy.  Me?  I didn't go to college.  No, fuck that.  You really need to say that, Voss?  Why don't you just say I can't fly? 
[04:01:30]  I didn't go to college either.  Richard's trying to brag there.  Look at all the knowledge I have, and I didn't go to college.  He's a hard mark.  Sometimes he's a hard mark.  It wouldn't surprise me if you didn't get out of third grade.  Richard's expected all of us to go, really?  What?  You didn't go to college?  As well-spoken as you are?  That's impossible.  All right.  Bye, listeners.  Oh, look.  The mics were still on. 
[04:02:00]  All right.  Take it easy.  Good night, everybody.  Goodbye.  See you tomorrow.  Have a good one.  Fan, it's all yours.  Good, Fan.  Later.  I'm fine for it.  Yeah, just sitting there.  No.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Production. 
[04:02:30]  Hey, kid.  Need a ride?  Master, what's that rubber sticker on your car?  That's a wow sticker.  What's a wow sticker?  Now, you look tired.  Need a ride home?  What's a wow sticker?  I put it on my van so women will flash me when they drive by.  Listen, I've got some kittens in the back of my car.  Where can I get a wow sticker?  OpieandAnthony.com.  Now, listen.  Your mommy and daddy were in a terrible accident and asked me to drive you to the hospital.  Oh, no.  I hope mommy and daddy are okay. 
[04:03:00]  Quick, get in.  Let go of my arm.  You're hurting me.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here.  Get in here. </pre>
