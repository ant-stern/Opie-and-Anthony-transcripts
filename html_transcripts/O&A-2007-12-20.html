<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about their controversial radio style and the pressure to be "nice," juxtaposing this with cynical commentary on the commercialization of Christmas and the anticipated joy of fatherhood.  A news story about vandalized inflatable Christmas decorations sparked reminiscences about childhood pranks involving mailboxes and M80s, referencing the movie *Butterfly Effect*.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing upcoming holiday parties and the challenges of birthdays near Christmas.

The main focus shifted to the arrival of Tippy Tom, a homeless man with an incredibly strong and overwhelmingly foul body odor, described in graphic detail.  The hosts' reactions included moving chairs, using gas masks, and timing how long it took for the smell to reach different parts of the studio.  A detailed examination of Tippy Tom's severely swollen and infected feet, possibly exhibiting gangrene, resulted in several people becoming physically ill.  Despite this, Tippy Tom participated in a brief interview, discussing his loneliness, his difficult day, singing snippets of songs, and sharing his TV and cartoon preferences. The segment concluded with continued descriptions of the smell and Tippy Tom's condition, and a promotion for a "Homeless for the Holidays" CD.  A brief sports news segment about steroid use in baseball was squeezed in before returning to the Tippy Tom segment.

Further discussion of Tippy Tom and his recurring appearances dominated a later segment, along with listener calls expressing disgust and a caller correctly identifying his condition as necrotizing fasciitis.  The hosts recounted past incidents, including Tippy Tom removing his pants and underwear on air, and mentioned sending a male stripper to visit him in the hospital.  Papa Rock, a homeless musician, made a studio appearance, attempting unsuccessfully to play a Christmas song, resulting in mockery from the hosts and Jim Norton.  Papa Rock discussed his recent guitar theft and his sobriety.  Big A and Twitchell joined for a year-in-review segment, frequently interrupted by Big A's speech impediments.  Sandy Kane also appeared, adding to the chaotic atmosphere.  This segment culminated in a chaotic game of "$10,000 Homeless Pyramid," featuring several guests, including Tippy Tom, whose feet remained a focal point of discussion.  Judah Freelander from *30 Rock* was mentioned as a future guest.

Judah Freelander did appear as a guest, participating in a highly unsuccessful game similar to "$25,000 Pyramid" alongside various recurring personalities. The game was marked by rule-breaking and ensuing laughter and frustration.  The hosts also promoted their upcoming appearance on Jay Leno's show, recalling a previous appearance involving a lawnmower-powered margarita blender.  The writers' strike was discussed, explaining the cancellation of planned segments like "Homeless Shopping Spree" and an eggnog drinking contest due to network concerns and legal issues.  A listener's complaint about the uncomfortable studio furniture led to a discussion about their relationship with management.  The segment ended with a highly uncomfortable situation where Tippy Tom was pressured into stripping down to his underwear on-air for $100, resulting in strong smells and pandemonium.  Chris Rock was announced as the next day's guest.

A further segment focused on a chaotic in-studio event with Tippy Tom and Sandy Kane, featuring sexually explicit conversations and crude jokes about Tom's appearance and hygiene.  A story about a 7-foot-tall 12-year-old was briefly discussed with vulgar commentary before the focus returned to Tippy Tom, with suggestions ranging from entering him in a "Money Honey" contest to making him a "bubble boy."  Sandy Kane engaged in sexually suggestive banter with the hosts and Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom's clothing was gradually removed, culminating in a slow dance with Sandy Kane that escalated into increasingly explicit behavior.  The hosts encouraged their interactions with crude commentary and suggestions.  This led to a "Money Honey" contest featuring women in lingerie, covered in honey, and having money thrown at them.  Mike Cole briefly appeared to celebrate his 40th birthday before departing. Pat Duffy and others assisted with the contest setup.  The segment was marked by extreme profanity, sexual innuendo, and vulgar comments.  The contest concluded with the women collecting money, amidst ribald commentary from the hosts and a heated exchange between Iraq and Sandy Kane.  The show also included plugs for sponsors, comedy shows (including Judah Freelander), and the band Missiles and Markers.

The broadcast concluded with a nonsensical and repetitive segment involving chants of "You're always on my mind," interspersed with random phrases like "share the crystal never lie," "you're crazy," and "we're escaping."  This ended with a self-deprecating "Yeah, we suck" and their signature sign-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shot Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Shots, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a 380 in my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  They are sick. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like transvestite.  Or transsexual.  Transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says, pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  All around.  What's next?  Every single day.  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  Is it? 
[00:02:00]  Everyone enjoying themselves?  The last minute shopping?  Can I tell you what I say when people are cranking this time of the year?  Oh, what?  I'll walk up and go, oh, don't be such a Scrooge.  Scrooge.  Get out of my way.  I got to buy a present for Granny.  I understand.  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  I say happy holidays to everybody so as not to offend.  You know, I don't say Merry Christmas.  I go, happy holidays, just in case you're a Jew. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, but I say Merry Christmas to everybody because it's not about religion anymore.  No.  It's about shopping.  It's about shopping.  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  Are we buying into this again this year? 
[00:03:00]  Crappy holiday.  I'm going to be honest with you, though.  I will be a father.  What?  Is this news?  I don't have a big announcement.  Wow.  Like Britney Spears.  Like her little sister.  What a nice little slut story that is.  Odd, isn't it?  She's going to be a mom at, what, 17 by the time the kid's born?  She's an old maid in her family.  I'm going to be a father by four.  By four. 
[00:03:30]  But, yes, I sound like a Scrooge who gives a crap about Christmas, but I'm willing to  say that I will look forward to it again when I have a little fellow or a little girl  running around.  Well, because it's about the children.  It really is.  I mean, when you're, like, single and you're up birth.  When you're a bit older and you don't have kids around, it's a stupid holiday. 
[00:04:00]  They had a story on the news just before we got on the air.  These two kids on Long Island, did they get arrested, I guess?  Yeah, they're mug shots.  They looked all scared.  They were just dopey kids from Long Island.  Dopey kids from Long Island.  They got arrested for taking screwdrivers to those big blow-up snowmen that's on everyone's  front lawn.  Yeah, they got the blow-up snowmen, Santa Claus, things like that, Christmas stuff.  You know, you thought you were going to be the only one.  You saw this in a department store and went, wow.  All the neighbors are going to love this one, hon.  I'm going to be the hit of the neighborhood. 
[00:04:30]  I'm going to have a blow-up snowman on my front lawn, or I'm going to have the blow-up,  like, the snow, the globe.  Yeah, the big snow globe with the scene inside.  Yeah.  We're going to be the hit, honey, of the neighborhood.  And then, what, fast forward a mere season or two, and every single house has the exact  same thing?  Everyone's got them.  It's like the fad that was the icicle lights for so long.  Remember that?  And when you first saw them, it was like, wow, those look pretty cool.  They kind of dangle down. 
[00:05:00]  Something different?  Yeah.  And then everybody just had them all over their house.  Right.  Wasn't special anymore.  So, what happened with those guys with the screwdrivers?  What did they do?  Well, they did what you should do on Long Island.  They must have put sturdier bases for them.  They could screwdrivers.  No.  No?  No.  They were just running around, popping, just stabbing Santa and Frosty the Snowman with  their screwdrivers and leaving them deflated on the front lawns.  The first thing I thought was, that's exactly what you should be doing. 
[00:05:30]  That's what you do, especially on Long Island.  Yeah.  I mean, as a kid, if you weren't driving your car into people's garbage pails, blowing  up mailboxes, knocking down people's mailboxes, driving through people's backyards.  We thought we were cool because we would blow up mailboxes with M80s, and we always found  like, the nerd of the school.  You know, we went after all the soft targets.  You know, we didn't go after the gangsters in our high school.  We went after like, you know, the kids that had a 4.0 and a perfect score on their SATs. 
[00:06:00]  You know.  The ones you knew you could handle.  Yeah, because we're crazy.  And then we would pop the M80 in their mailbox, and then we would be at least a half mile down  the road by the time we heard the noise of the mailbox blowing up.  Yeah, you heard the boom.  We were tough kids, I'm telling you.  That's an attention getter.  It certainly is.  I don't know.  I was always a little leery about doing that to mailboxes, even before that movie came  out, that Ashton Kutcher movie, where he's able to go back in time or whatever the hell 
[00:06:30]  it is.  Which one?  What?  Butterfly Effect.  Oh, Butterfly Effect.  Yeah, because that...  I didn't see that movie.  Oh, man.  That scene where they put the M80 in the mailbox, and then they stand by in the woods and kind  of watch.  And as they're doing it, the woman pulls up in her driveway, takes her baby out of  the car.  She's holding her baby and walks up to the mailbox.  Oh, that's cute.  And opens up and just, you know, they imply the baby just gets its face blown off.  How long of a fuse do they use? 
[00:07:00]  They used a cigarette fuse.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Well, why would you do that?  I know.  If you're just going to stand and watch, you don't really need the cigarette fuse.  Just light the damn thing.  No.  Huh?  Why didn't they warn her?  Uh, because they were just, like, standing there, like kids do, just in kind of shock  watching, going, oh, boy, this is going to be bad.  It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  Everywhere you go.  I think that's it. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, that's it.  Right.  Sure.  Are you looking forward to the trip to Colorado?  You're two days out.  Ah, yes.  Two days out.  Ready to rock.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ready to go.  Got a early morning flight there on Saturday.  Uh-huh.  And late night Friday.  So, I think I'm just going to sleep a lot on the plane.  What are you doing Friday?  There seems to be a party going on around here.  I know.  A celebration to last throughout the year. 
[00:08:00]  So, get your good times and your laughter, too.  When are you guys going to run?  I could baseball bat his head while you were.  I know.  Okay.  I wish you would have.  More importantly, when are you guys going to run out of reasons to party?  That's what Jimmy and I need to know.  I don't know.  There seems to be a reason for a party all the time.  There's a reason for a party every weekend.  Yeah.  But there's got to be a point where you just run out of reasons.  Yeah.  At least we're secretly hoping. 
[00:08:30]  I think once the holidays pass, there's really no reason.  There's a lot of holiday parties.  Yeah.  There was, you know, the Baby F party.  And then there's Ron and Fez various parties.  Well, they had their Winter Carnival.  Yeah.  Keeping it safe for everybody.  Winter Carnival.  I went to that one.  And then there's a birthday party-z-z-z.  Yeah.  More than one-z-z-z.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Danny's is coming up.  Tomorrow night. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  21st.  Right.  And Melinda's is the 28th.  So that's a Christmas birthday thing.  I forgot she had a Christmas birthday.  Yeah.  That sucks.  That's all right.  I got a sister-in-law.  Same thing.  Christmas Day, I believe.  Yeah.  And they always try to make good, like, a little extra present under the tree.  You never make good.  Because it's one thing.  You just lose.  Yeah.  Everybody that has it around Christmas, their birthday, they just do lose. 
[00:09:30]  I know you're very generous and you do the right thing, but people who have birthdays  around the holiday, they just lose in the end.  If you have a birthday on December 25th, you should walk around all day on your birthday  going, I'm Christ.  Right.  I'm Jesus.  I would just walk around all day going, but what about me?  Just walk up to Jews for no reason.  You rejected me.  What?  Right.  I've been at my brother's house when they try to celebrate the birthday along with Christmas.  Yeah.  All the kids are running around with their excitement, opening up a million gifts. 
[00:10:00]  And it's like, oh, you know, five minutes to blow out candles for a birthday cake.  All right.  Bring out the birthday present.  And then the birthday cake just sits there on the counter.  Because it's Christmas.  Who cares?  And all the kids go back to celebrating Christmas.  They wrap up some frankincense and myrrh.  Sure.  For your birthday.  Sure.  Frankincense and myrrh.  Hey, we got the story of those kids popping the blow-ups.  Well, two Long Island vandals who allegedly attacked a blow-up Santa with a screwdriver are 
[00:10:30]  free without bail this morning.  16-year-old Christopher Morrison and 20-year-old Kevin Burding pleaded guilty to charges.  They punctured the Santa in front of a West Islip home.  They left a cell phone at the scene.  And when they returned to get it, the homeowner followed them and called 911.  You dummies.  They'll be back in court next week.  And they look scared as well.  Oh, the 16-year-old was petrified in his mug shot.  He had a real scared, uh-oh, I'm going to be the bitch of the jailhouse look. 
[00:11:00]  Because in that situation, you don't know you're just going to be released without bail.  I think, Goof, because the cops probably really poured it on thick.  I guess your pals Opie and Anthony should tell you, hang in there.  It'll be all right.  You'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  You're not going to the, you know...  It won't be on your permanent record.  You're not going to the F the A prison.  Right.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Hang in there.  You're okay.  You're just dopey kids doing what dopey kids should be doing.  The 20-year-olds, that's a little marginal as far as these shenanigans with your 16-year-old 
[00:11:30]  friend.  Right.  Perhaps you should be, uh, I don't know, doing something else.  True.  16, though.  Yeah, what else are you going to do?  You got raging hormones.  Yeah.  Of course you got to do something.  You got to knife that Santa.  You got to pop that snowman.  You know, because the video games told you to, right?  Yeah.  Right, kids?  Violent video games.  They cause everything.  Of course they do.  They cause, uh, they cause acne at this point. 
[00:12:00]  Yes.  Uh, and then, uh, we were watching what's called the local news here in New York.  This can't be good.  What, what, what, what?  Keith just grabbed a can of Lysol.  Oh, boy.  Keith is already here.  Keith the cop, what do you got?  All I can say is we're going to need a bigger can.  It's really, really bad.  I hate.  We have the return of over a year, tippy-tom.  Oh, and he is horrific. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Look, look, I really, is there any way possible, I can, I never thought I'd say this, I could  sit near E-Rock.  Just sit over there.  Take over your buttons.  Should I go there?  I know I got my sound of, okay, I'll try it here.  I'm going to try it here for a little while.  But if any of them, Keith, your job is to keep them away from me at all costs.  I am not a fan of the homeless. 
[00:13:00]  And don't, don't be giving me crap about underprivileged, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We're talking about crazy people, not people that fell through the cracks of society, trying  to raise a family, and then they're in shelters.  We're talking about lunatics that don't like to bathe.  Can we get a Christmas song from Tibby Tom right off the bat?  If you want, I'm sure he's ready to go.  All right, get him way near the door.  I am going to swing around.  And by the way, let me know when you're ready.  By the way, just use E-Rock's area.  He's not using it. 
[00:13:30]  Get your gas mask on.  I really want a gas mask.  Kenny, it's really bad?  Yeah.  It's real bad.  What does it smell like?  Keep it clean.  Keep it clean.  They could gag a maggot.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  All right.  Hey, as Keith gets Tibby Tom, homeless for the holidays.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we'll play that.  Okay.  Also, do we have a stopwatch?  I want to see from the second he gets in this room, how long it takes for the stench  to waft over to this area. 
[00:14:00]  I thought you meant how long it's going to take him to curse.  I hope they're wide awake down the hall.  Yeah.  You better be wide awake down the hall.  All right.  Hey, so local news here.  In New York, don't worry about that, because they're going to bring him in in a second  here.  Channel 11, trying to add humor to their awful local newscast.  Yeah.  And I guess there's a story about a wolf in a bar.  So the anchor woman-  Made a joke.  Insisted that she needed to do this today. 
[00:14:30]  No, no, yes.  The frig, man.  Why do you panic so much?  I need to know.  I need to know why.  Dude.  He's not...  You can handle it.  Because I don't need effing head lice.  Is that what the big problem is you're worried about?  That, amongst other things.  Maybe all right.  All right.  No, shut up, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I swear to God, Jimmy.  What?  Just shut up.  I think I get more... 
[00:15:00]  You recognize me better at this point.  All right.  We don't need a stopwatch.  Hi, Tom.  There it is.  You smell already?  Holy mother of God damn it.  Holy Jesus.  I don't smell.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Dude.  No, you do.  What's up, Tom?  How you doing?  Stop it.  No.  Kenny.  Kenny.  God damn it.  All right.  Jimmy is messing with that so much.  Give it to me, Tom.  I'll hit it, too.  Give it to me.  All right. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy is messing with Anthony so much.  God damn it.  Tippi Tom looks god-awful, by the way.  Can I say something?  Dude.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Will you gag him for a second?  What I love about this...  Okay.  You should be on.  You're on it.  Ant has bailed.  He's now where E-Rock sits.  Oh, my God.  You really?  Dude.  Yeah, look.  See, Jimmy.  Look, there.  There.  I have never seen a smell diffused through a room as quickly as this.  He's a bit gaming.  I don't want the mic on yet.  Answer your question, please.  It is so, so disgustingly... 
[00:16:00]  All right.  But I got to explain what happened.  Like, Anthony...  Oh, God.  Anthony gets really...  He's back here.  ...really creeped out when the homeless come in here.  He doesn't want the homeless near him.  He...  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Okay, good.  I'm glad you...  We're all getting hit by it now.  Wow.  It is...  This will drop you.  What is that?  Dude, it is so bad.  It smells like...  I think somebody had missed an opportunity to use the restroom.  Holy...  No, I don't...  No, it's worse than that.  Oh, E-Rock just got hit. 
[00:16:30]  E-Rock just got hit with it.  Yes.  It's all the way now to the back of the room.  I can't function.  Look, I got to be...  I say this a lot.  I got to be honest.  But here really is the deal.  Usually this stuff doesn't bother me.  Holy cow.  What is that?  Dude.  It smells...  Oh, my God.  I can't even talk.  Dude, it comes in waves.  It smells like rotting apple cider.  It's the only way I can explain it.  And throw in some of that really bad stuff that comes out of humans.  Puke. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Crap.  It smells a bit like just feces.  It smells like someone who's...  No.  It's more than that.  It smells like...  It's rotting flesh.  It smells like that, Jimmy, but it smells like it's been fermented.  Dude, it's a smorgasbord.  Anyway, it smells like this.  Picture loaded diapers if a body was wearing them.  Dude.  I can't get any further away from him.  I need something.  I am...  I need a mask or a certain mask.  Needless to say, the cab wasn't very happy when I put them in the smell.  I am a...  Holy God, I bet.  Shall you imagine? 
[00:17:30]  A cab, though...  It took...  It required a little bit of manipulation.  He's an air freshener.  Dude.  This smell has pushed me back 10 feet from the board.  Anthony has given up on his area.  But I guess it doesn't even matter what I was going to say because we're all affected now.  But when Tom comes in, we like messing with Anthony because he gets really freaked out.  He doesn't want these people anywhere near him.  So what Jimmy did was he held up a nice, crisp $20 bill.  And of course, Timmy Tom came a-running.  And that's what you heard when all that commotion went in going, all right, Kenny, Kenny. 
[00:18:00]  And then he had a bail.  Well, I imagine it would have reached over here anyway.  What interns are here today?  Jared.  One.  Jared.  That's it?  That's it.  We ought to have him check to see where the smell's coming from.  Yeah, absolutely.  He's got to get in real close.  Absolutely.  And see if it's coming from underarms.  Absolutely.  Or maybe other darker regions.  By the way, Steve from Long Island is saying, I can't get to his phone call, but he does write,  I bet Ant wishes he was late today. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Although, that is going to be in here for an entire day now.  That smell.  I'll tell you what's going on, though.  Now it's just becoming part of the air.  It's not that bad.  I agree.  No, I'm serious, but I mean, if you're new and you come in here, you're going to smell  it.  I don't smell it anymore, right?  It must be my body shutting down.  It's kind of like, this is kind of a nom thing happening.  The receptors in your nose get deadened to the smells.  Is that what happens?  Yeah.  I've never wanted to bring my girlfriend here so badly. 
[00:19:00]  So she can appreciate what she has.  Yeah, there you go.  Appreciate it.  How you been, Tom?  We haven't seen you in a while.  Are you doing okay?  What's up, Tom?  I'm doing great, man.  What I'm saying is this, man.  Where do I get to go in here?  Yeah.  You're on the air.  All right.  Yeah.  Here's to be Tom back again.  Thanks to these guys.  Thanks.  A very good man that knows where I go.  And so what I'm doing is I'm trying to, should I hold it up?  Okay.  What I'm saying is this, is that I'm very happy to be back and I'm lost for words for a few 
[00:19:30]  seconds, but the thing is this, is that I would like everybody just to treat me really good  because I've been treated bad all day and now I've been, the day is fairly begun.  I mean, it was a bad day for me today, but now it's a good day.  Why was it a bad day, Tom?  And I feel very happy.  Why was it a bad day?  Excuse me.  I hear a voice.  Go ahead.  Why was it a bad day for you?  You got to say it again.  Why was it a bad day? 
[00:20:00]  Um, because none of my friends were around down on 14th street, didn't see nobody and  I'm all by myself and I was lonely and I don't like to be all by myself because I guess, you  know, lonely.  And so, uh, nobody was there, you know, guys that I hang out with and I was all by myself.  All right.  And so.  Well, I wonder Pepe Le Pew.  It's not what I don't like to be by myself.  It's what I, I do not like is that I don't like to be by myself.  All right.  Let's.  And so I.  All right, Tom. 
[00:20:30]  Well, it's good to see you again.  It's good to see you again.  Okay.  All right.  Stop babbling.  Please.  For the love of God.  You can keep talking.  Just keep talking.  Um, I guess the sweatpants bit is over by the way.  Wow.  Yeah.  My sweatpants bit is a, is a joke compared to what we're smelling right now.  We only have Jared here today.  All right.  We'll figure something out with Jared and Tippi Tom.  Tippi Tom, you want to sing a little Christmas song?  It is the holidays.  What do you got?  I can't hear you.  You got to speak up.  Do you want to sing a Christmas song?  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Take us to a break with the, with the Christmas song.  Which one you want to hear? 
[00:21:00]  Whatever one, man.  What's your favorite Christmas song?  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.  Jingle round, round the clock.  Jingle bell, jingle ringle, ringle, ding, ding.  That's the jingle bell rock.  Oh.  That's all I know about that one tune.  Oh, you want another one?  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  How about another one?  Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.  He had a very shiny nose, like me. 
[00:21:30]  And whenever...  I feel bad that I have a nose.  Yeah, I'm testing right now.  No, I can't.  Okay.  Christmas songs are, can I do some Angleburg Humperdinck?  Okay.  Humperdinck.  So I sing you to sleep, after the lovin', I brush back the hair from your eyes, and I sing  the lyrics, all right, no, okay, I'm going to Rod Stewart now. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Rod, go to Rod Stewart.  Hey!  If you want my body.  My favorite.  And you think this is sexy, there's something out of your mind.  You know, that's my version.  Yeah, it's good.  All right, I'm trying.  Laughing at the homeless is fun.  You should sing If You Want My Body in Potter's Field.  I like the chipmunks.  Does anybody know the chipmunks? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, well, Alvin and the Chipmunks, one of the hottest movies in America.  You don't have any chipmunks here?  No, we don't have any chipmunks.  Why don't you just sing one?  God damn.  Sing some chipmunks.  All right, I ain't got to sing them with Bugs Bunny.  He don't sing.  I'm thinking of something else.  All right.  What am I thinking of?  Well, I was thinking of Elmer Fudd.  Okay.  Do you like Elmer Fudd?  We do.  Oh.  Yeah, he's my favorite hero.  Elmer.  Favorite hero? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, damn right.  Why is he your favorite?  Hold on.  Why is he your favorite hero?  What do you mean you don't like Elmer Fudd?  I hate Elmer Fudd.  You hate Elmer Fudd?  That's right.  Man, that's not nice.  Elmer Fudd.  Why do you like Elmer Fudd?  Because he knows how to...  He has a gun.  And he also knows how to go after Roberts.  And he's a hunter.  And that's Elmer Fudd.  And he's the best.  That's why I watch it on TV. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Where do you watch TV?  Why?  You don't like Elmer Fudd?  Where do you watch TV?  Where do you watch TV?  Anthony can't hear you.  You have to speak a little bit.  Where do you watch TV?  Well, wherever.  Wherever there's a TV, I watch it.  You know, in a train station, occasionally, or a pan station, they got TV there, too, believe  it or not.  Wherever somebody invites me over, I watch TV there. 
[00:24:00]  And I watch all my shows that I like.  They invite you over.  Whatever's on the channel.  And because that's what I like.  Nosferatu.  Yeah.  All right, Tom.  We'll get back to you in a minute or two.  Thank you.  Good seeing you.  That's it.  You're out.  You're out.  You weren't that good on the air.  So long.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're taking a break right now.  All right.  I'll be back.  I hope so.  And come up with something new.  Yeah.  Go figure out what you want to do next. 
[00:24:30]  It's Tibby Tom, everyone.  We're doing, I think, like a homeless pyramid type of game today with Tibby Tom and others.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  What runs to his head?  Like when he's not here.  I don't know, man.  It's just gibberish.  Look, we'll acknowledge it's phone call Thursday today.  Everyone's calling for that.  Oh, God.  But we got to keep the phone lines open today because we actually are going to do a real  show today.  Dude.  It's really good.  That smell.  And the worst thing is, it's now in this room. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, nice.  You can't smell it anymore because the receptors are all dead in your nose now.  Yeah, I know.  But it's going to be absorbed in our clothes.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, the homeless.  Yeah.  Go out there with a flamethrower.  Oh, my God.  Please.  We'll go to break with this.  It's like I am legend.  They just come out.  I didn't mean to get the guy to come by.  I apologize.  Gee, thanks, Jimmy. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't think he'd come over.  I couldn't wait for you to do that.  You didn't think he'd come over.  Dangle a steak in front of a lion.  That's what you did.  And he came over.  And the smell just.  How much for you to hug him?  There's no amount.  No amount.  Maybe we get someone else to hug him, though, for a few buckaroonies.  A few shekels.  We got a lot.  We got lots to do with Tibby Tom today.  Stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Go to that thing first, though.  All right.  You've heard them go shopping on the Opie and Anthony show.  Now hear them sing. 
[00:26:00]  K-Smell Records and the Salvation Army present Homeless for the Holidays.  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  Oh, what fun it is to ride on a goddamn step lady.  Spend Christmas with your favorite homeless lunatics.  You'll hear all the classics.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Had a very shiny nose just like yours.  Deck the halls.  There's the season to be jolly. 
[00:26:30]  La la la la la la la la.  And who could forget Ziggy's haunting rendition of Silent Night?  Silent Night.  Holy Night.  And if you call within the next ten seconds, we'll throw in as an added bonus,  the making of Homeless for the Holidays featuring never-before-heard homeless outtakes.  I'll take your gun and shoot you in the head.  You shoot all these motherfuckers.  Let me off.  Let me off. 
[00:27:00]  Let me off.  I'm tired as s**t.  I said I'm tired as s**t.  Off-key, out of time, and smells horrible, it's Homeless for the Holidays.  Get yours today.  Call 1-800-HEP-A-TITUS.  Good morning, everybody.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  I want to say good morning to Buffalo.  Everybody listening on the edge.  The home of Shred and Reagan. 
[00:27:30]  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing we did very, very well up there.  As far as the old ratings go.  Thank you.  Thank you, Buffalo.  Good peeps.  Kurt Schilling says Roger Clemens should give back his Cy Youngs.  I don't think that's happening.  I really don't see that happening.  No, because there's no surprise with this steroid thing.  Yeah.  We all have to realize there's no surprise with this steroid thing.  It's the steroid era of baseball. 
[00:28:00]  It'll pass us by, and then we'll move on to the next controversy.  Yeah, whatever else happens.  Whatever it is.  Kurt Schilling knew people were using steroids.  Yeah.  What's this holier-than-thou attitude any of these guys have?  They knew what was going on.  Obviously, he wasn't using any steroids.  He's a big boy with kind of like one of those beer bellies.  A punch.  And still pitching like a maniac.  God bless him.  What were they injecting into his ankle?  Ah.  Ah.  When he's had his big, bloody ankle thing. 
[00:28:30]  Can I slow everybody down?  They're yelling and screaming for Opie's stinky sweatpants.  It's on instant feedback.  I don't know what's going on.  I think some of the pests got together, and they said,  come on, you've got to call the show,  and you've got to write in about Opie's sweatpants.  We need the stinky sweatpants on the show.  It's just...  Let me tell you something.  My sweatpants are in-house.  Yeah.  Snuck them in today.  Are they?  They're here.  But after what we just smelled, bit over, I'm telling you. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  It would have to run second place because...  Bit over.  We can't explain what we just smelled.  It's not good.  It's not good.  No.  And I was telling these guys during the break, I'm like,  when Ant started yelling and screaming and carrying on,  I'm like, I'd say Ant, that's what he does when Tippy Tom comes in.  He can't handle the smells.  It just makes me giggle and laugh.  Yeah.  But then it hit Jimmy, and then when it hit me, I'm like, wow.  I've got to admit, this is god-awful today.  He is at his worst today.  This is the worst we've ever smelled, right?  We've known him for years.  He's come in every time. 
[00:29:30]  I've had to run away from him because of the smell.  But today is worse than ever.  It's pretty amazing.  He smelled so bad.  My first thought was holy moly.  Holy moly.  Yeah, when you're going holy moly, you can't even think straight.  Nothing sarcastic, nothing angry.  No.  By the way, you see how we handled the Curt Schilling thing?  That's all you need to do.  That's it.  That's all you need to do in morning radio.  Story over.  Acknowledge that Curt Schilling says Roger Clemens should give back his Cy Youngs and move on.  Story done.  Say it ain't happening, that's it. 
[00:30:00]  Sports Radio will talk about this for three hours today.  Take any of your opinions.  Do you think you should give back the Cy Young awards?  Do you think they're back?  Stop.  Don't talk about it.  It's not going to happen.  You got away with something.  A lot of players got away with something.  How?  What?  How are you eating in here?  Something with milk in it, I don't get it.  How are you eating in here?  Listen, I drove all the way from downtown in the cab with them.  What do you mean with them?  I was in the cab.  There's more than one? 
[00:30:30]  Oh yeah, Papa Rock's here too.  Oh no.  Did the city bring his awful guitar?  He's got the guitar.  So he can fiddle with the knobs?  Fiddle?  Tell him he's got to work on a Christmas song for us.  Yeah, he's got one.  He's ready to go.  I'm out of my mind today because, you know, just having Tippi Tom here and Papa Rock,  Papa Rock, I'm thinking why aren't we not, why aren't we doing the homeless shopping spree?  It's radio effing gold.  But, we'll keep calm today.  By the way, Jimmy walked out of the bathroom and I go, Jimmy, you're looking like the lead 
[00:31:00]  singer of Linkin Park today because, you know, he's got that look with the shaved head  and the glasses at times.  And then you had to point out that you're growing a mustache.  I see that now.  What are you doing?  You're growing a little mustache.  Let me squint so I can make it a little darker in my view and get a little look.  You're going to look like...  Is it for a part?  Like a door-to-door salesman.  What are you doing?  What are you doing with a mustache? 
[00:31:30]  Girls like it.  Did you go crazy overnight?  Girls like it.  Yeah, when Magnum P.I. was on.  Exactly.  I want to grow a nice thick mustache.  Are you really going to grow a big thick mustache?  I want to hang outside the high school and go, hey.  Flavor saver.  It looks creepy.  It will really be creepy on you.  Because you're a fresh-faced boy.  He's up to something.  No, no.  I just want to have a mustache.  Yeah, but we're going on vacation.  I would have loved to see this grown in.  No, no.  I'll do it on vacation.  I'll just have it.  No, you know what? 
[00:32:00]  You're not doing your New Year's Eve show at the North Fork Theater with a mustache.  I know you.  You're not going to be on stage with a mustache.  No way.  Would you?  I would.  I know you're a type of mustache.  No, you're not.  No, it's a mustache.  He's up to something.  He is the mustachioed Jim Norton.  You know, I've been growing a goatee for a couple weeks.  I think I'm coming in with a mustache.  Well, yours are much fuller than mine would be.  Well, I'm going to go with the long mustache because tomorrow's the last day before a little 
[00:32:30]  break.  No, you're not.  Doing the James Hetfield.  I'm going to do a long mustache for everybody.  Or should I go tight?  You should go with like BJ Honeycutt.  Go real tight?  I'm going to go a tight mustache tomorrow.  Almost too tight, if you know what I mean.  Dude.  A-H.  Two letters.  Go with the A-H.  How about you do mustache tomorrow, too?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Should I do this one, though?  Yeah.  Should I just cut them off so it's equal with the nostrils?  Should we do impromptu mustache day tomorrow?  Just be silly geese.  Follow Jimmy's lead? 
[00:33:00]  What are you doing, man?  The John Holmes?  Go with the John Holmes mustache.  That's your perfect 70s porno mustache.  Yeah.  You look like it's going to end right at your lip line.  Yeah, probably.  Like right where your mouth's...  Like you'd have a cop mustache.  I want my mustache to be straight, though.  Marine mustache.  Like a piece of duct tape when you put it under your nose?  Yeah.  Like I want to keep it away from my lips and just put it like a little rectangle under my...  Not a Hitler mustache.  It's like a long...  Yeah, yeah.  Like a groucho.  Yeah.  Jim Norton's up to something. 
[00:33:30]  He'll let us know when he's ready.  Yeah.  Because there's no way he's just growing it for the hell of a...  Shenanigans are going on with Jim Norton.  I'm just thinking of it.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, now that we have tippy-tom, this is almost who cares, but local news today just trying  to make jokes, working in a joke into their news story here.  Mm-hmm.  Listen to this, Bob.  Well, you know the joke.  A guy walks into a bar.  Ouch!  That's a bad one.  But how about this one?  So why'd you tell it?  A guy walks into a bar? 
[00:34:00]  Ouch.  Ouch.  Oh, because he bumped into it?  Have you ever heard that joke?  No, I haven't.  I've heard a lot of, you know, blank walks into a bar jokes, but never just guy walks into  a bar.  Ouch.  No one's ever heard that joke.  There's usually something before it, like a blind guy walks into a bar.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Or...  A Jew walks into a bar.  Something.  Well, that's the...  He owns it.  He owns it.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Something like that.  There's plenty of those.  But it's not just a guy walks into a bar. 
[00:34:30]  Ouch.  Ouch.  Ouch.  There has to be a reason he's walking into the bar.  Can we hear that?  Well, you know the joke.  A guy walks into a bar?  Ouch.  Oh.  Oops.  You laugh before the punchline.  Oh, I kind of did that on purpose.  Ah.  How would you know when to laugh?  What?  Does she have another one or no?  Uh, that's it.  Well, you know the joke.  A guy walks into a bar?  Ouch.  That's a bad one.  But how about this one?  Okay, terrific.  A wolf walks into a bar, has a burger and leaves. 
[00:35:00]  No joke.  And then they played a wolf sound effect.  A wolf walks into a bar?  Yeah.  Had a burger and left.  Like an actual wolf?  He probably walked in and just ate off someone's plate like a dog.  Yeah, yeah.  And then just like they fed him and he left.  Have they just run out of stuff to talk about?  That's a story from Italy, I think it was.  Yeah.  Like why?  They're just trolling like Fark and Drudge Report.  Sure.  And just Brear, Brart. 
[00:35:30]  Brear, Brart.  Those three, they're the ones that got us in trouble.  Yeah.  Brear, Brart.  Brear, Brart.  Here's the rest of the story.  The Italian bar owner says there was no mistaking.  Uh-huh.  I just, I just say it.  Come back, come back, come back.  He said it definitely looked like a wolf.  It was thin.  It may have been suffering from a bout of the cold weather.  But apparently the wolf sauntered in and then out of the bar like one of the regulars.  Wait, this is a burger and left.  It was hungry.  They fed it.  Hungry like the wolf. 
[00:36:00]  It's a nice dog.  Okay.  Right, Jill?  You know?  Duran Duran reference.  A wolf in another country.  Well, possibly it was a wolf.  They think it was a wolf.  Could have been a stray dog.  But it possibly was a wolf in another country.  Hungryly wandered into an establishment to scavenge for food.  And it's just a news story. 
[00:36:30]  And it's news.  Yeah.  That would be interesting if they said a brontosaurus walked in.  Yeah.  And spoke.  Why don't you talk about how the government is throwing another billion dollars into the war effort?  Or maybe it's a few billion, right?  What's the total?  They just...  Oh, I lost track.  But it's perhaps more than that, Jim.  They just...  They're throwing a few more billion at the war effort.  Then you start realizing, wow, this country has a lot of money. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know where that money comes from.  If we're not in a war, wouldn't that just go into surplus?  You know, why couldn't we just take that billion dollars just every once in a while and just solve one of the many problems in America?  And go, you know what?  Today we've decided to just throw a billion dollars at this problem.  We'll give everyone in the war the day off.  They throw billions at this war like it's nothing.  Yeah.  But they're talking about wolves walking into a bar.  I don't know the exact total.  We now need to know how many billions they're throwing at the war effort this week. 
[00:37:30]  There was something else.  Oh, can we get Tibby Tom back in here?  Oh, God.  What?  Look, I understand it's all fun and games, but I'm back in my seat.  You're not going to be sitting there today.  I don't want him over here.  And here he comes.  I don't want him over here.  Here he comes, Tibby Tom.  I'm coming back into the room.  Kenny, could you please keep him over there?  I can't take it.  All we're trying to do, we've all acknowledged that he smells really bad today. 
[00:38:00]  It's rancid.  And we're just going to try to figure out where the smell is coming from.  That's all.  Good luck.  A little game called Where Is the Smell Coming From?  The Grim Reaper.  I think that's the smell of the reaper.  Jared's not here.  What?  Jared's not here right now.  Oh, Jared's not here?  That's okay.  So there's no reason to have to be in.  Oh, there is?  Yeah, there's another reason.  Okay.  Is he coming in or what?  70 billion being used for the war? 
[00:38:30]  Every what?  A brand new 70 billion, right?  Wow.  Why is he in there?  Come on.  We're running out of time.  No, not that way.  No, no, back, back that way.  Oh, my God.  We got a bitch.  We got a just have this.  Can I have him stay away from me?  Are you serious?  I'm so serious.  I'm not even kidding.  I can't deal with this. 
[00:39:00]  The guy would have passed right past me.  Right there.  The last mic.  He's a human being.  No, he's not.  Just stop it.  He's a human.  He's a fellow human being.  Just advocate bringing in the military.  It's Christmas.  And just doing whatever they got to do.  You know, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  I'm not feeling very charitable this year.  Hey, Tippi Tom. 
[00:39:30]  Somebody mentioned my name.  Yes, sir.  What's going on?  Keith is suggesting, and I think it's a wonderful idea.  Who's here?  Keith, you know, the guy that's holding the mic for you.  You know, Keith.  He's right to your left.  You know, I'm deaf in one ear, so I have to listen closely.  You're going to have to speak louder, please.  One ear.  Keith.  Dirt from 1955 in there.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm trying to catch on.  What exactly are you saying? 
[00:40:00]  Keith, why don't you tell Tippi what you think he should be saying?  You're saying what?  Shut up.  Keith will tell you.  What is he saying?  Why is he deaf all of a sudden?  We would like to give you new socks, so we want you to take your shoes off so we can give  you new socks.  Oh, that's a good idea.  You know?  That would be a...  I don't have no socks on anyway, so new socks would be wonderful.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  Is that a real dry heave at?  You can sit down right here, and you can take your socks off.  Wait, I need that right here?  On the floor?  No, I'm going to give you a chair.  Wait, do those bikes work over there? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  All right.  No!  Oh, yeah.  Son of a frigging bitch.  I want everybody to stand back.  This may be hazardous to your health.  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  All right, Ant.  Yeah!  Ant, I'm at ground zero.  You are a brave man.  I'm getting some new socks, and I'm happy.  All right.  I'm getting some new socks.  Damn right, new socks.  And you damn right, I'm going to be happy.  All right, take off your shoes, Tippy Tom.  Stand back.  I want everybody to stand back. 
[00:41:00]  Why?  You know it's going to be awful?  You know something?  He smells...  Oh, my God!  Check this out!  What's with your ankle there, Tippy?  His ankle is like twice, probably four times the size.  Looks like Hillary Clinton.  Well, no, no.  This is the bigger, though.  This is the big leg.  Let me see that one.  Oh, your whole leg up to your knee.  Why is it swollen?  That's a good question.  I do not know why.  Dude, you...  It happens every winter, and this is not the first time, but it goes down in the spring.  All right.  That's how you could tell what season it is. 
[00:41:30]  It's like other things on my body get swollen.  Yeah.  But it goes down eventually.  It goes down in the spring.  Okay.  Well, so we'll look forward to spring.  I take off the shoe.  This is behind me.  All right.  The shoe.  Which one first?  Yes.  Take that one off.  What happened to your socks?  I have a line.  This is it.  My socks.  That's what I'm saying.  I don't know what happened.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  My mask is on now.  His skin is completely black.  Oh, my God.  Oh, get a picture of that. 
[00:42:00]  Can you somebody wash my feet, please?  Holy Jesus.  I want to curse so bad.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Jimmy, come over here.  I see it from here.  It looks like...  Wow.  How do you...  It's just my stuff in the shoe.  How much would you take over there and lick and just suck on his big toe?  It's a science project.  Science project.  Dude, his foot is so...  Your ankle is giant.  Yeah.  Look at the dark black all around.  Look.  Underneath the foot, on the side of the foot. 
[00:42:30]  That's gangrene.  It looks like gangrene or some kind of black fungus.  It might be black mold.  Seriously.  What's going on?  Look at it on his shin just over there.  Lift up your pants leg a little bit.  Pull up your pant leg as high as you can.  It's too tight.  It's too tight.  Because his leg is all swelled up.  I can only go so far.  My legs are too fat.  It's like an elephant leg.  I put on weight this week.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  I hope he's dry heaving now.  See, I used to be really good looking like...  All right.  The smell is coming not from his feet.  It's when he lifted his leg up, his pant... 
[00:43:00]  Oh, you smelled that part.  Yeah, what is that?  It's rotting flesh.  Dude, it's some kind of sore, and I think you're right.  I think it's rotting flesh.  It's fungus.  Lift up that pant leg again.  You said pull my foot out, so I did.  Oh, my God.  I warned you.  I'm getting knocked out.  It's horrific.  All right.  Lift up that pant leg.  I'm trying to stay in here.  It ain't going to come up too further.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Oh, my Lord.  I don't like the fact that you're holding that microphone and dropping it. 
[00:43:30]  E-Rock, you got to hold that microphone.  Oh, my Lord.  That's why I need bell bottoms.  Let E-Rock hold the bell bottoms.  E-Rock, grab that mic and get down there.  You know, you don't have to touch him, but no, grab this mic and get down there and tell  us what's going on with his leg.  I'm four feet away, and it keeps...  I swear to God, it keeps knocking me back.  That's how bad the smell is from this close a range.  Yeah, yep.  All right, get in there, E-Rock.  It never needs to work.  All right, E-Rock, is it...  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  Dude, when...  Oh, my God.  Hey, don't drop the mic, God damn it. 
[00:44:00]  Holy crap.  I know.  Wait, you guys know I'm usually the one that can handle a little more in general when it  comes to this crap.  This is horrific.  E-Rock, get in there.  Get in there, the boss said.  I'm four feet away.  You can get two feet away.  It knocks you back.  This smell knocks you back.  That's how bad it is.  Oh, my God.  E-Rock.  Easy on the microphone, man.  E-Rock.  Get a mic in there.  Hold on.  If you're going to puke, wait.  You've got to puke on the air.  Oh, no.  E-Rock, you've got to puke.  Get him a wastebasket. 
[00:44:30]  That was orange juice.  Oh, my God.  All right, E-Rock puked.  Here, we've got to wait.  Wastebasket.  I really want you to get...  I'm sorry about this, guys.  All right, lift up your leg.  I want E-Rock to get two feet away.  Oh.  All right, E-Rock, get down on your knees.  Get the clothespins and put it on your nose.  Get...  All right, take your other shoe off, by the way, too.  What are we, cartoons?  All right, get down there, E-Rock.  Oh, I can't.  No, you've got to.  Oh, I can't.  The boss said get down there.  Oh, no.  Get down there.  Oh, he's dry heaving. 
[00:45:00]  Dude, the smell...  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's dry heaving.  Ah-ha.  No, that's awful.  You know, E-Rock, get on your knees, really.  Come on, what's wrong with you?  Oh, I'm close to him.  Get close to him.  If both shoes go off, I don't know.  All right.  Tom, the other one's got to come off.  You're going to run out of the building.  Take your other shoe off.  We've got to take a break here, but take your other shoe off.  E-Rock, get on your knees.  Get on my knees.  And tippy-top, lift up your pant leg.  This will knock E-Rock out loud.  Prepare yourself.  Come here, T-Mobile.  Okay. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  The other one.  What is this?  What's tied around it?  Well, when I was in the Civil War, they gave me this.  It's holding my heel on.  I can get it.  What's under that bandage?  What's under the bandana?  He just took his other shoe off, and there's like a black bandana wrapped around his foot.  Steven Tyler's foot.  Yeah, yeah.  What's under that?  He definitely needs some work.  What's under that?  He's tootsies definitely needs some work.  He said that.  I am not proud of it.  He's tootsies definitely needs some work.  I'm afraid I want to. 
[00:46:00]  Yes, a frigging hacksaw.  You guys got on like a foot bandana?  A misery.  Hold on, hold on.  So, Tom, what's under that black bandana?  That's because it's like a sock.  That's a sock, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Basically, that's all I had to put on this foot.  Wait, E-Rock, over here.  What?  Hey, E-Rock.  I'm breaking the mic.  No, E-Rock's going into the bathroom.  Oh, he just.  Oh, wow.  He just puked.  E-Rock just puked.  You heard it in the distance? 
[00:46:30]  It's so loud.  I don't have no socks, and I had to do something.  Is that my guy?  What would you do if you had no socks?  All right, E-Rock's back.  E-Rock, what got you?  I put plastic bags on your feet.  E-Rock, what got you?  He lifts his leg and just something just comes flying at you.  It really is bad when he lifts his right leg.  It's horrific.  Tom, lift up your pant leg, please.  That one.  Which one?  Now, E-Rock, get down there.  I want you to tell us what the sword.  Just lift up that leg. 
[00:47:00]  Which leg do you want me to lift up?  The right one, whatever.  I got two legs.  Well, for now.  Yeah, I'll check with you later.  You got to understand.  Dude, you're going to lose your leg.  Which leg to go up?  He's going to be one of those guys on the skateboard.  That one, let's go.  We got to take a break.  There's two irons in his hand.  E-Rock, check it out.  What is it?  E-Rock, just check out that thing.  What is that?  Go, E-Rock.  Dr. Nagel.  Yes, Dr.  That's where the...  It is not that guy.  We found out where the smell's coming from. 
[00:47:30]  Stay right there.  When you have him lift that leg up, I'm telling you, that's where the smell's coming.  Lift the pant leg up.  That's where the smell's coming from.  It's not even his feet.  It's whatever that is.  Shake the pant leg.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  Don't mind.  Lift him up more.  It's cold.  I can't go much higher.  Take him down, then.  Yes, I want to see, because it gets real fat above there, doesn't it?  Yeah, there's something really bad going on under that pant leg.  Yeah.  He's got an open sore in his leg. 
[00:48:00]  I got more than that.  Oh, great.  All right.  Don't you know, these feet are made for walking.  Unlike you guys, I don't get to walk around much.  I do.  Yeah.  Oh, Jared.  Jared.  What's up?  Oh, God.  Jared's here.  Don't touch him, but tell us what that is.  I wouldn't touch it either.  Here, lift up the bottom of your pant leg a little bit.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  I'm going to mess my can. 
[00:48:30]  Just a little bit.  The front.  The front.  The front.  He don't listen.  Of course he doesn't.  Jared, could you help him lift his leg up?  No, don't touch him.  I wouldn't touch him.  Oh, touch me, touch me, touch me.  No, it's all right.  All right, well.  You guys are scared.  Oh, that's better.  That's better.  That's great.  The opium Dr. Mengele show.  It's in a surgical mask. 
[00:49:00]  There he is.  It threw me out.  All right, listen.  Dr. Parker?  You know him.  All right, listen.  It's not his feet, believe it or not.  The feet are horrific.  They smell bad, but there's something under the right pant leg.  I'll turn it down a little bit.  It's an open...  But as soon as he lifts up the pant leg, the smell that comes from this area, it could be the worst smell I've ever smelled in my life.  He has, um...  It actually knocks you back, like repellent.  Yeah.  It knocks you physically back.  You cannot get close to it. 
[00:49:30]  It's a combination of rotting flesh and underpants that are probably not in the best condition.  Right.  Nobody get to look at my feet no more, because...  No, we're going to get you new socks, Tom.  Yeah, we're getting you new socks.  I think, uh...  If we get surgical gloves, I think we're going to have Jared or somebody actually wash your feet for you.  You know, we're in the holiday-giving mood here.  Let's say hi to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim.  We're going to put up with his shirt.  Tim, thank you guys for these warm holiday moments.  You know, you really put me in the spirit for the season, and uh... 
[00:50:00]  What about coming home?  Thanks, fellas.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kyle in Missouri.  Kyle?  Hey, Hopi and Anthony, little baby Jim.  Hello.  Hey.  Excellent show today.  I've been anticipating Tippi Tom coming on.  Yeah, we love Tippi Tom.  I tell you what, are y'all not having the homeless shopping spree this year?  Uh...  We better, uh...  Well, no, we're not doing it.  No.  I'll tell you what, I'm sure we're looking forward to it. 
[00:50:30]  It's bad.  It smells.  It's a sore spot with us, but we're just not doing it.  Not our choice, by the way.  Is this cell coming through my phone?  It's horrific.  The smell is horrific.  Oh.  Part of it is just the fact that he's gone to the bathroom in his pants.  I'm telling you, that's a big part of it.  No, no.  A big part of it is his flesh is rotting.  This is not...  It's decomposing flesh.  It's the smell of death.  I would have to go with Anthony.  Jimmy, someone else has to go over there.  It's amazing that it physically knocks you back. 
[00:51:00]  Your whole body gets knocked back by this smell.  You can't get that close to it.  We've got to take a break and then come back and have somebody work on those tootsies.  Yeah, we'll figure some out.  Those tootsies.  These tootsies need some work.  These tootsies need some work.  Hey, is Papa Rock ready with his Christmas song and his stupid guitar that he fiddles with?  All right, we'll do that after the night.  We're going to bring on the fiddler.  We're going to bring on the fiddler.  If you don't know who Papa Rock is, oh boy, stick around.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, we got a good one today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  We took a bunch of pictures of Tippi Tom's foot, the rotting foot, and those pictures will  definitely be up in all the usual places, including onaradio.com later today.  All the visual stuff we talk about on this show, we throw up on onaradio.com.  So keep that in mind.  Good afternoon, Cleveland.  Good afternoon to Cleveland, yes. 
[00:52:00]  And once again, hello, Buffalo.  Hello, Buffalo.  Buffalo loving the Opie and Anthony show lately, and we greatly appreciate that.  Let's say hi to Scott in Wisconsin.  Scott?  Thank you a lot, Opie.  Are you a cheese hand?  Damn right I am.  I look forward to the Wisconsin phone calls.  I said cheese hand.  That's my bet.  Are you a cheese hand?  Absolutely.  Go Packers, go.  Yeah, F the Packers.  F Brett Farr.  Go Pats, go. 
[00:52:30]  I just want to say thanks a lot.  I've been listening to you guys for a long damn time.  And I had to pull over the car this morning because I shot coffee through my nose, and you  already have a line of the day.  Tippi Tom says, I've only got two feet.  And you're like, for now.  For now.  That's a good one.  Yeah, as soon as we went to break, we were talking about Tippi Tom and his legs, and  we're convinced the next time we see Tippi Tom, he will be in a wheelchair.  He's not surviving what's going on there.  You can't have your legs that swollen and rotting without doctors having to cut them off  at some point and leave him on that skateboard, holding the two irons in his hand, rolling 
[00:53:00]  down the street.  I used that leg, and I just roll with these eyes.  Well, he's probably drinking more than he should.  Oh, you think?  Yeah.  It would definitely not be good for the legs.  And for the people that linger longer, they do know that Tippi Tom was cleaned up for  a short time.  We actually saw Tippi Tom well-groomed.  He had no beard.  He had a haircut.  We talked to him while he was in the rehab or wherever he was, and he talked completely 
[00:53:30]  normal.  He talked extremely gay.  Almost with a lisp.  Yeah.  It was weird.  When he's cleaned up, he talks very feminine.  Yeah.  Very, very effeminate.  Effeminate, I should say.  Affectionation to his voice.  And we had hopes for Tippi Tom, and then that lasted a mere couple weeks, and he's now,  this is years ago at this point.  He is worse than he's ever been.  Yeah.  So, thank you, Scott.  What do you got, Keith?  Yeah.  We sent the male stripper down there to the hospital that time, into the bed when we heard 
[00:54:00]  him talking gay.  That's right.  We had to sneak him into the hospital room, and he stripped him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We forgot to mention, for the new listeners, Tippi Tom is gay, and he has the bug.  He has the bug.  He's got the bug.  He's got many, many bugs, but he's got the super bug, if you know what I mean.  And we tried to do the right thing when we found out he was in the hospital trying to  clean up his act, and we sent a male stripper to the hospital for him. 
[00:54:30]  And, man, did he enjoy that.  Oh.  It was the highlight of his life.  Yeah.  So, is Papa Rock ready to go?  Papa Rock's ready to go.  With the Christmas song?  Fiddling.  Let's go to Adam in Cleveland.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  That was the nastiest thing I've ever seen on Pal Talk in my life.  I actually threw up in my mouth.  Yeah, Iraq put the picture up on Open 2 on Pal Talk, and people were just completely disgusted. 
[00:55:00]  It's amazing.  It's his feet.  They're black.  There it is.  There it is.  Oh, God.  Look how swollen it is.  Yeah.  It's shiny.  It's so swollen that the skin is shiny from just being stretched so tight.  And one of my things on the show, I can handle this stuff, because I look at it as kind of  a freak show, and today I finally had to tap out.  The smell I was smelling when I was really close, just, I got to keep saying it, it knocks  you physically back.  Yeah.  There's something inside you as a human being that tells you, you have to move back from 
[00:55:30]  this smell.  And you could see right at his, right before the cuff of his pants, there's a white crusty  sore right over there that's surrounded by black, which is rotting skin.  He's really frustrating, because all we want to do is have him lift up his pant leg, and  that's going to take 20 to 30 minutes, and we don't have that time on this show.  He can't get his pant leg up, or I don't think he'd get his pants off.  Have him pull him down, then.  Why don't we try to take him down?  I don't think he can.  Yes, he can.  Well, cut him off and buy him a new pair, but bigger.  Pull him down?  Do you remember when he pulled his pants off last time? 
[00:56:00]  Remember over at XM when he took his pants and his underwear off?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Let's just say, there was at one point where I was reminded of Peppermint Patty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was hilarious, though, because he used to have white underpants, and they were gray.  They were completely gray and falling off his body. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  Hey, Adam.  Oh, you want someone to lick his foot?  Yes.  Oh, it's impossible.  You have to have somebody fillate that thing.  I've got to be honest.  Impossible.  I don't think we could get that done.  There is something really, really bad with that leg.  I'd do it for a PS3.  You would do it for a PS3?  Now you're talking.  You couldn't.  I don't think a human being is capable of that.  A little bit of hot sauce would be fine.  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Hey, Samantha knows what is going on with the leg, I guess. 
[00:57:00]  Samantha from Long Island.  What's up?  What's up, boys?  How you doing?  Good.  Hey.  I know what Tippy Tom has.  Yeah?  It's called necrotizing fasciitis.  What's that?  It's a flesh-eating disease.  What?  I was actually, yeah, it's a flesh-eating disease.  I used to work with the doctor that fixed Stalker Patty's feet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  Well, how do you get rid of it?  You got it with a lot, a lot of antibiotics and in a hyperbaric chamber. 
[00:57:30]  I want a hyperbaric chamber.  Linger longer.  All right, Samantha, thank you.  You think it's really that?  I don't know if it's a flesh-eating disease.  I don't know.  Don't worry.  Tom's panicking down the hall.  No one's going to be touching Tippy Tom's leg.  Even we know that.  I'm not taking the surgical mask off.  Throw salt on it.  You look ridiculous.  I know I look very silly, but I'm keeping it on because I don't want.  Not only the smell, but who knows what is just the airborne diseases. 
[00:58:00]  Well, we got Papa Rock.  Papa Rock.  I want to say Papa Roach every single time this guy comes in.  Why is there an echo?  Wow, because the mic just got real loud or something.  Hey, Papa.  Yeah.  What are you doing, bro?  Sitting here picking it.  Picking what?  Your guitar?  Either one.  What?  Either one.  Either one.  You all right there, Papa Rock?  Yeah.  How are you? 
[00:58:30]  Good.  Good.  How about a song?  Yeah, there you go.  How about a song?  How are you feeling this morning?  A little early for you?  I ain't even had a cigarette yet.  What are you talking about?  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  Then it is early.  That wasn't funny.  Hey, I'm picking it.  Horrible, Joe.  I'm picking it.  Can you work up a Christmas song for us?  I'll try to.  All right.  Let's hear it.  I don't know the exact words of all of it.  What child is this? 
[00:59:00]  Fiddling.  Well, maybe you and Tom could do a duet or something.  I don't know.  Stop stalling.  Yeah, stop stalling.  Let's hear it.  I don't want him in here, man.  Get away from me, man.  Shoot.  Why don't you want him in here?  Huh?  Why don't you want him in here?  Ooh, that smell.  Gotta smell that smell.  Oh, he doesn't like Tippi Tom.  Is that the problem?  All right.  Here's Papa Rock with his guitar.  Yes.  We got him a brand new.  Why are we charitable?  It doesn't do any good.  We gave you a brand new guitar.  What happened to it? 
[00:59:30]  I went to South Beach over there.  South Beach.  Poverty in Paradise.  South Beach.  And it was stolen a week after I got there.  How'd you get down there?  I found the money.  Somebody dropped some money outside of a bar.  He took a bus?  He robbed somebody.  He took Hamtrak.  Why would you go to South Beach?  Never been there.  My friends lived there.  Where? 
[01:00:00]  On what park bench?  No, Alton Road.  They got an apartment.  Oh, how about that?  Excuse me.  Why didn't you stay there?  Why'd you come back in the winter?  Yeah, it's nice.  Nice?  Nice down there.  Yeah.  Well, you got a choice out there.  You eat out of garbage bags?  Uh-huh.  I mean, garbage cans?  Yeah.  Or else you rely on somebody to give you a doggie bag.  They don't have soup kitchens.  All right.  Why don't we hear a song? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Play us a Christmas tune.  All right.  He's turning on his guitar.  He's not plugged in or anything yet?  This is his thing.  He just fiddles.  This is the famous fiddler for the people that linger warm.  Hey, you got to set up sometime, right?  Well, you had it now.  Yeah, you had it all morning.  All morning.  This was your big moment.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  That sounds like tippy smells.  Yeah.  Hey, brother.  How are you?  All right.  Stop stalling.  What's he doing? 
[01:01:00]  I don't know.  What is that?  Oh.  Will you stop picking and play something?  What?  Oh.  What are you doing? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, you messed me up.  Oh, my God.  Will you stop?  Will you stop?  Will you stop?  He's constantly.  Stop fiddling with those buttons and play something or I'll break your arm.  Constantly with the knobs.  Go for it.  Will you just play something?  Play a song.  Can we talk about the fact that if you were homeless and had nothing to do except play 
[01:02:00]  that guitar all day, he should be Jimmy Page.  Yeah, sure.  He sucks.  What?  He stinks.  I bet you he's really good at playing it like when the strings are bouncing off his forehead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he's horrendous.  He's getting something.  He's not a good player. 
[01:02:30]  I'm a heavy metal operator.  I want to see something.  It's just, it's just. 
[01:03:00]  Sometimes in the homeless, you hope to find a hidden gem.  There's nothing going on here.  Here.  It's terrible.  He's not a good guitar player.  He's not at all.  It's just, it sounds like his fingers are stuck in the strings.  Why is he carrying that?  It's just a heavy burden.  Dusty from PowTalk writes, I want to cover my ears with Tippi Tom's feet. 
[01:03:30]  Good line, Dusty.  What the heck?  We went through all of them last time, right?  Eric Crafton and all that.  Yeah, we did that.  We did that.  Sure.  That was funny.  Good times.  Find it on audible.com. 
[01:04:00]  Eric Crafton.  We're not going to redo that one.  Hey.  Randy sleeps on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mike from Chicago writes, get him to a hostel.  He has gangrene.  We don't care about Tippi Tom anymore.  We've tried.  You know, there's a point where you just got to just let what's going to happen happen.  That's what I hate.  He sounds like someone perpetually warming up.  Yeah.  He never gets to it.  It's like going to a dead show.  Yeah.  Hey.  What are you doing?  Hey.  Oh, y'all know that's what it was like. 
[01:04:30]  Hey.  Hey.  These long jams that went nowhere.  Nothing wrong with space and drums, my friend.  Papa, was that your song?  We don't even know.  He's unplugged again.  What happened?  Where was the Christmas song?  Where was some singing?  Yeah.  What's going on with you?  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, okay.  I lost my voice somewhere between Metallica and Guns N' Roses.  And Radiohead.  You like Radiohead?  I wouldn't have assumed to that. 
[01:05:00]  That's a...  Well, who do you like?  The Archies?  Ah!  Oh, wow.  That's like his thing.  He thinks he has a crazy voice.  Like...  I know, I know.  I know.  Hey, do that deep voice again.  That's pretty crazy.  It scares...  My voice.  That scares a lot of people.  I had no voice.  All right.  Calm down.  Wow.  Calm down there.  It's just an embarrassment of teeth.  I am dead.  We know.  Oh, yeah.  Scary voice.  I am death master. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Scary voice guy.  We get it.  Wow.  Ooh.  That was creepy.  Take your practice.  Ooh, here's some change.  You scare me.  Yeah.  Stop trying to be ominous.  That's creepy.  You're skinny with an odor.  Jimmy.  Do the death voice again.  No.  Why not?  I will not.  Wow.  That's scary.  No one freaks out when he does it.  He's always hoping people go, whoa, where'd that come from?  Hey, watch it.  That guy's dead.  And then they just crack him in the face. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, listen.  I'm doing it sober.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  This is your sober, huh?  Thank you.  God bless you.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is my seventh day.  Do them without seven.  Seven days.  Wow.  That's good.  Yep.  Oh, good for you.  Oh, I thought maybe you were just broke.  That's why I had coffee in the green room.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, good for you.  Good for you.  Is this an attempt at maybe getting off the streets?  Yeah.  This is your first attempt.  So you get sober, and then what?  You get yourself maybe a job or something? 
[01:06:30]  I'm going through treatment.  Oh, you're going through treatment?  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  That's good.  Now we can't mess with you.  That is good.  That's wonderful.  You still, you know, play guitar like shit, but as long as you're going through.  Yeah, I know.  I dropped the S-bomb.  You can't even play it.  That was special for the PalTalk people.  What are you doing with that crotch bag on your mouth?  Huh?  The crotch bag.  What are you doing?  The crotch bag?  Oh, he's calling what you have on your face a crotch bag.  It could be.  You could call it that, because where most of the smell is emanating from on these guys. 
[01:07:00]  Ooh, that smell.  Yeah, I know.  That smell, that smell.  I'm wearing this to keep from smelling things and from getting diseases.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know how that goes.  Do you?  No, I doubt it.  All right, well, we're not getting much.  No, my Gibson SG broke, man.  Yeah?  I laid my bag down on it.  Actually, I just kind of slammed it down on it.  Yeah, why?  Because your neck couldn't take it.  Because you're angry.  So, I saved up my money, and I got this. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  What money did you save up?  Like, panhandling and stuff?  No, I didn't.  On Christmas time, you don't need to panhandle.  They just gave up, walked up and gave it to you.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, that's pretty good.  A lot of people in New York feel generous around this time.  All the tourists come here, and they're all charitable, because they feel guilty that  they just came out of Tiffany and spent a bunch of money.  So, hey, that's nice.  Nice racket.  Yeah, you don't hang around Kmart and stuff like that to get to the, you know.  No, hang around in the nice, the good places, expensive places. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Good.  So, why don't we get them out of here?  All right.  Thank you.  We'll have you back in in a little while.  So, grab your guitar and go back and relax with Tippi Tom.  Yep.  And we'll see you in a bit.  Take care, Shredder.  All right.  Take care of what?  I don't know.  Shredder.  Shredder.  Or sweater.  I couldn't tell, and I couldn't care less.  All right.  When we get back, it's Big A, and Twitchell's doing the year in review in news. 
[01:08:30]  Good.  So, we'll get a break from the smells.  I hope so.  No, we won't.  No, we won't.  That's true.  I'm hearing Big A smells today.  What's that about?  Stinky show.  What's going on with Big A?  This show stinks.  What's going on?  In honor of Tippi Tom, we'll play this going into break.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here. 
[01:09:00]  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're searching of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS. 
[01:09:30]  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  I missed that up.  I missed?  Oh.  Yeah, hit it, hit it, hit it.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  This is a story about a man. 
[01:10:00]  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All we go. 
[01:10:30]  Just late at night.  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That is yours.  This is my life. 
[01:11:00]  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have homes.  This is my life. 
[01:11:30]  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece.  Yeah, once again.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  A little piece.  We were one verse away from a hit song.  And we were not able to complete that, unfortunately.  He just couldn't have finished it.  Would have been a hit.  And he couldn't do it.  I have no doubt it would have been a hit.  It would have been played all over radio.  Yeah.  But we couldn't get a second verse out of the guy.  Homeless guy coming out. 
[01:12:00]  Great song like that.  That's great.  We'll sing about Tibby Tom.  Drew Boogie threw the music behind it.  And we put him in a studio.  We did everything to try to get that second verse.  And nothing.  We had a hit on our hands, I'm telling you.  I bet he brought it back in now.  I bet he could give another verse.  We may have to write it for him.  You think?  We even tried that.  Drew Boogie was trying to write for him.  And it just, he did that off the cuff, though.  Yeah.  What do you hear?  And we get so many requests for that damn little thing. 
[01:12:30]  Shelter me by Gray Wolf.  Even has a name and everything.  Hey, we got Twitchels and Big A in studio.  Big A, I didn't mean to insult you.  But you do look very big.  And I was concerned for your health.  Steve's in studio because he saw this whole thing go down.  Well, you could have phrased it a little bit more delicately other than, you know, your  usual blunt shovel attack on the English language.  Well, Big A walked in.  I haven't seen him in a while.  I'm like, wow, you look really fat.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  And I meant that in a loving way, like I'm concerned for you.  On what planet is that loving?  But it seems like you're gaining a lot of weight.  What's going on with you, Big A?  I guess it's the holiday season.  Right.  They do say you gain a lot of extra weight during the holidays.  Right.  Is that it?  Hey, the average person gains about eight pounds during the holiday.  Are you coughing?  I'm not.  Oh.  You're so paranoid today, Ian.  Oh, my God.  Put your surgical mask back on. 
[01:13:30]  I have to.  I don't know what.  And then we got Twitchels in studio as well.  I really need a plastic bubble.  What's up?  Well, we had you guys come in to do kind of like the year in review and news.  All right.  And Twitchels, you look thinner.  Oh, thanks, man.  Wow.  I had to take the jacket off.  Jesus.  What?  I was timing that.  What?  You're purposely trying to lose weight?  I'm in a show now.  And I haven't done theater in four years, so I'm trying to stay active. 
[01:14:00]  What show are you doing?  Neil Simon's Laughter on the 23rd Floor.  Is that off, off, off Broadway?  I guess you could say.  Well, it's a little theater that's in the middle of the river.  Well, George Carlin performed it this year.  It's called the Broadway Theater in Pittman, New Jersey.  How many more names can you draw?  It opens February.  Why don't you do The Wizard of Oz?  You do a hell of a cowardly line.  I know.  If there were a show, if there was, like, a theater company doing it locally, I would  love to do it. 
[01:14:30]  That's my favorite show to be a part of.  And you know we love The Cowardly Mind.  We love when you do The Cowardly Mind.  Can you do it just for old times?  Oh, guys.  Happy holidays.  I'll put him up.  I'll put him up.  It stinks like hell in here.  Do you like that?  Do you like the impression?  It's terrific.  No.  It's funny, because when I do the put him up, it's a good thing he's got his face.  You didn't do that.  Yeah, he's doing the put him up part with the fist.  That's what he likes.  I'll put him up.  I'll put him up.  I'll fight your one hand behind my back. 
[01:15:00]  I'll fight your fander on one part.  Anthony loves that, by the way.  Anthony, why are you not?  What are you doing, Ant?  I'm Purelling.  Purelling yourself.  I think he might have gotten some spit flex over here.  Yeah.  All right.  You like that impression?  Boo.  All right.  Let's get the news out of the way.  Laughter on the 23rd floor.  Yeah, it's a great show. 
[01:15:30]  If you were flying out a window, perhaps.  You don't like Twitchell's, Ant?  Huh?  Louis Twitchell Santani?  You don't like him?  It's not that I don't like Twitchell's.  I don't like him.  No, he lost...  And Big 8 found it.  Look at you, too.  What, do you have a deal?  You have to...  Never mind.  Oh.  What one losing to another game?  I was trying to work that into a funny little joke and failed miserably. 
[01:16:00]  On all fronts.  Thank you.  Yes.  I saw that.  Go.  Screw.  Yeah.  All right.  You ready for the top 2007 stories of the year?  Absolutely.  Top 2007.  It should just be top...  All right, whatever.  Top stories of the year.  With Twitchell's...  Louis Twitchell's Santani?  Yes.  That's the way it's said.

[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  This never gets old.  You actually stop breathing when Big A tries to say those S-T words.  You get in trouble with certain sounds.  Wow.  You have a lot of trouble with that today.  More than usual, I'm thinking.  All right.  You want to start over?  I'm sorry.  We interrupted you.  Sorry, Big A.  Oh, no.  We didn't mean to interrupt.  Just hop the presses.  Oh.  This is the return of the dudes with Big A and Twitchell's year in review style. 
[01:17:30]  I'm Louis Twitchell's Santani.  And I'm...  Just for you, Ed.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I'm Big...  And I'm Big...  Oh.  Get down.  Oh.  Oh.  A steady...  As a...

[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  It's Opie and Anthony sitting in brand new chairs that we fucking hate. 
[02:17:00]  They're awful.  Me and Jimmy have already gotten our old chairs back.  The new chairs, they're very futuristic.  They look very expensive.  They're rock hard and make you sit up almost so you're falling over forward like your back  is completely straight.  I like that it puts me up a little higher, but besides that, they suck.  Where's the old couch?  And we like the old couch.  Yeah, we like the old couch.  By the way, if Washington is listening, I don't think they listen anymore, but whatever. 
[02:17:30]  Maybe one of them is.  Maybe Don's listening.  Who knows?  I don't know.  The new couch, the new couch you guys bought us up here, we hate it.  No one's sitting on it.  It's a waste of money and it's a waste of space.  So we either got to like just throw it out the window and replace it with something or  not.  But that thing has to go because no one's using it.  We love the old sofa that you had in here, like the old leather ones and these chairs  that we have right now are fine.  We didn't need new chairs and new fangled sofas. 
[02:18:00]  Love these chairs.  By the way, Steve, we're not wasting time.  This is stuff that you really need to tell Don.  The couch sucks.  No one's using it.  And these chairs.  And the chairs are.  And it's not just us being a bitchy whiny show because guaranteed when the brilliant  Ron Bennington gets in here and sits in one of those chairs, he's not going to  like it and he's going to want his old chair back.  What's with these chairs, Fez?  Yeah, I sat in the chair for a second.  Who the fuck sat in these to decide that they were going to be good?  Guys in D.C. thought you would like these apparently. 
[02:18:30]  No, man.  Like, I'm doing some stuff for my new apartment.  What you do is you sit in a lot of chairs and you go, socks, socks.  Oh, this isn't bad.  That's a comfy one.  All right, I'll consider this.  It takes time.  Yeah.  The chair's supposed to work with you a little bit.  Yeah.  No one tries.  No ones don't work with you.  Dude, no one tried this chair out.  I guarantee it.  I guarantee it.  It's common knowledge that I need lumbar support.  Lumbar.  Lumbar.  Lumbar.  I specifically said get the lumbar support.  Everyone's asking about homeless shopping spree.  They shut us down.  Fucking, you know, the other place didn't want us to do homeless shopping spree. 
[02:19:00]  Yep.  Which I, you know.  It's not right.  It's the holiday season.  Even Juna Freelander knows about homeless shopping.  Bottom line is we would have had to gobble up a music day part and that would have been  bad for the station because three hours of us would have hurt the station in the afternoon.  And then eggnog drinking contest.  I think XM was the ones who shut that one down.  I think XM is just trying to, is fucking, they're being Carl and Kenny cautious right  now.  Yeah, I understand.  Because they want to be Mike Merger. 
[02:19:30]  They don't need fucking Danny Death making an appearance when fucking Chip Chokes shows  that XM, XM strongly suggested to us, but because of the deal we have, we can't really do this.  They want us to pretty much take the next month off.  They want this merger to go through and they want us to be part of this new company.  So they're like, it would be out of trouble.  It would be in everyone's best interest if you guys pretty much just went away.  Yeah.  But we kind of can't do that because of the other deal we have with CBS. 
[02:20:00]  So we're in this like quandary.  Oh boy, would I love a month off.  I would just book a trip to the Caribbean and just disappear for a month.  Yup.  They're saying it behooves you to behave.  And that's why the eggnog drinking contest, because that stupid woman had to drop dead  drinking a little water.  I know.  Dummy.  We got lawyers that are now a little paranoid.  She couldn't be fucking Tina Tinkle.  Then we wouldn't be in this mess.  Gotta be Wendy water poisoning.  I know. 
[02:20:30]  And following the fucking family was Sue and Stanley Sue.  And keeping with that, you're not Maury Mustache anymore.  No.  No.  What happened?  I was fucking Shemp Shave.  I forgot I'm going to be Frank Films in a little while.  Barney baby face.  Hey, Mike Cole in studio.  Big happy birthday to you.  You want to give your age out there?  I don't know if you want to, though.  You're an old man now.  You look young.  I'm 40 and my tooth just fell out.  What am I?  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:21:00]  Look what happens.  What happened?  His tooth just fell out.  He's falling apart.  He's falling apart already.  Wait, his fucking tooth just fell out, this old man?  I think it did, dude.  Yeah, he did.  What happened?  What the fuck is that?  His tooth just fell out.  Is that one of yours or a fakie?  A fakie.  A fakie fell out?  He's like, Mr. Fakie.  Mike G, I can't talk.  What happened?  I'm 40 and my tooth just fell out.  Oh, jeez.  That's great.  Wow.  That changes your look so much.  Now you look like a soccer hooligan. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, wow.  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Piss off.  How'd you lose that tooth?  Yeah, originally.  Originally or whatever.  I bet it was a fight.  Huh?  Drinking a bottle of soda and someone threw a basketball at me.  Seriously.  Oh.  How old were you?  12.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Jeez.  Mike, it was a quick question.  You didn't have to sit down.  It's not like you're going to spend 20 minutes on you and your tooth falling out.  It really sucks.  Jesus.  So what happened?  You went to the emergency room?  No.  Now I'm not going to answer that. 
[02:22:00]  Aren't you supposed to put it in milk and take it to the dentist?  I'm going to put it under my pillow.  The tooth.  And then the uncle with liquor breath gets it.  Goodbye.  Bye.  All right.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Star of TMZ, by the way.  There's a dentist upstairs.  I'm not kidding either.  I've been there.  Dr. Sardowski.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, speaking of dentists.  He's a good egg.  He's good.  Good news.  I had my teeth cleaned and they cleaned out my food pocket.  It's not good news.  I never bothered me.  What's a food pocket? 
[02:22:30]  It's very awkward.  Causes a little smell every once in a while.  You've got to keep it cleaned out.  But they did a fine cleaning of the food pocket and they said now it should shrink back down  to normal and I shouldn't have a food pocket.  I think I might have a food pocket.  What is a food pocket?  You scrub your teeth and you still can't get that freshness in your mouth every once in  a while.  There's like a...  So what do they do?  What do they do?  There's bacteria that gets stuck in there and you've got to clean it out good.  There's a little gap in there or a hole or something.  Can't they fill it?  Can't they just drill it out and fill it a little bit?  No.  What it is, it's a gap actually between the tooth and the gum because of too much of that 
[02:23:00]  plaque.  So she cleaned it out nice.  Yeah, I think I got that, dude.  Why?  Does your breath smell?  It's not that your breath smells.  There's certain teeth that you feel like...  Like after I eat, there's always just chunks of food in there.  It's like I got a floss after eating every time and I just got just big chunks of stuff  coming out every time.  Wow.  Do you go with those little toothpick things?  No, I usually forget about it. 
[02:23:30]  They're not toothpicks though.  And then like at the end of the week, I'm like, oh man, I got to clean this.  What are they, floss sticks?  Is that what they're called?  They're little bristly things.  I've seen those.  No, I don't.  I should carry those around.  No, there's a little stick with a piece of floss in it.  No, no, no.  It looks like a one-stringed little guitar for a mouse.  No, dude, you're a rookie.  You're a rookie.  It's like a pipe cleaner for your teeth.  It has a lot of those bristles all around the thing and you stick it in between your teeth.  Man, you'll be knocking food out of your mouth like stuff.  That sounds cool.  I'm going to get one of those.  Sounds like torture.  Dude, you'll knock stuff out of there that has been lodged in there for who knows how long. 
[02:24:00]  Why does everybody get flush?  You got to floss every day.  You should do some flossing that I'm not that good at.  Jimmy, I'm going to turn you on to something.  You're going to be poking your teeth all day long.  I floss every day.  And you'll feel the chunks of food fall onto your tongue.  It's great.  Oh, Jesus.  Medical mystery.  Nearly seven feet tall at age 12.  Oh, shit.  This is the guy we talk about all the time.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Get audio of this kid.  I hope we got audio.  Well, I'm just a 12-year-old kid.  I'm a normal kid besides my size.  Here's my pictures of me with a... 
[02:24:30]  I bet you people fucking look at him in school kind of weird.  All right.  Here he is.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He looks kind of monstrous, though.  Look at his stupid face.  He looks like the Loch Ness idiot.  He has a fucking dumb face.  Well, obviously, there's some type of problem, probably in the pituitary gland.  Big, fat ankles.  Yeah.  Giving him a wacky face along with his wacky height.  He's got a duck under the doorways in his house.  Yeah, it's not a medical mystery.  It's the acromeglia that he's got. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  He's got to have that.  Dumb hands.  Wow.  And he's got huge feet.  His eyes are shut.  What's wrong with his eyes?  What the fuck is wrong with this kid's body?  Oh, his fingers are all bony.  Forget about the seven foot.  Why can't he open up his eyes?  He should be able to open his eyes.  He doesn't talk.  They just showed him playing a PSP.  That's some sick parents right there.  He's wearing monstrous fingers, and he's trying to play a PSP.  Dude, he's wearing braces that, forget about rubber bands, you need garage door springs  to pull those fuckers back because they're sticking out of his face. 
[02:25:30]  Coming out of the video, the anchor's smiling a little too much.  He's a buck-toothed idiot.  He's fucking seven feet tall.  He has half-shed Asian eyes, a tiny blonde head, and a buck teeth.  He's 0 for 50, this kid.  But he's tall.  Vince McMahon's got to get this kid in the ring.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Bring in the retard.  We got us a seven-foot retard.  Yeah, he's going to wrestle.  That's right.  You're going to have to get in the ring with a seven-foot, 12-year-old retardant child. 
[02:26:00]  And he's got braces on his teeth that'll rip you the struts, I promise you.  No chance in hell.  I hate your guy.  And that's right.  I was just going to bring up that Vince is now doing your impression.  Yes, yeah, I know.  For the people that weren't listening that day, we played a clip of Vince, and it seems 
[02:26:30]  like he's listening to this show.  We know, well, Sam and these guys say that they send the impression over to Vince, and  Vince seems to like it, I guess.  I think he's bringing a little Anthony into his impression now of himself.  Yeah, I would just do an over-the-top impression of Vince, but now it's Vince doing an impression  of me doing an impression of him.  That's awesome.  It's hysterical.  Do you want to hear it?  Do we have it?  Where is that one?  Because I would love to hear him do that.  We should play it again.  Because I don't remember him ever tailing off with words like that. 
[02:27:00]  It's an exaggeration.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's doing that now, which is hysterical.  That was Ant's twist on the whole thing, to just over-the-top exaggerate the last word.  Yeah.  And now Vince is doing this.  Do we have it?  Not this moment.  Oh, boy.  We're trying to find it.  Okay.  Where's E-Rock?  I know where we get it, Steve.  By the way, it also should be pointed out that this studio is completely covered in plastic  today for the money, honey thing that we barely promoted.  Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? 
[02:27:30]  It's like American Psycho.  Yeah.  I love it.  Red Rum is here with her husband.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Fantastic.  And a whole studio full of people.  Yes.  Bunch of peeps.  I hope that thing is not getting naked today.  Where's Tom?  Where's Tom?  Tom's here.  He's having a beverage.  Tom?  Beverage.  Tippi Tom's here?  A Coke, I hope.  Yes.  Well, this place is perfect for Tom today because he can't mess anything up because there's  plastic on everything.  I mean, even the stripper pole has plastic on it. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  And what's going to happen?  These girls are going to get naked and then they're going to rub themselves up with honey  and then we're going to throw a shitload of money all over the place and then they  got to roll around.  They can't use their hands.  You got my email about tying their hands behind their back or something?  Tying their hands.  That's hot.  Oh, yeah.  And then they got to roll and squirm and do whatever they can to get the money stuck  on their bodies.  And then one of the dollar bills, I believe, will have a trip for five days to Colorado  to do a little skiing.  Nice.  And I believe a Gamefly subscription as well. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  The prizes keep coming here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Okay.  We're trying to find the Vince thing.  What happened?  You're looking for it right now.  I was looking for it.  In the meantime, Drew Boogie's got a Club Soda Kenny remix.  Clubby's not here to hear this, but let's play this.  That's not how that's supposed to be.  That ain't it.  Oh, boy.  More problems, Don Wicklund. 
[02:29:00]  Why don't you get up here and fix some things, please?  Why isn't that working today?  Oh, the whole kit and caboodle went.  That's a new problem, huh?  Excuse my language.  When on the force, I once was a ruler, swinging a nightstick in suspect soup coolers, making  the joke that a woman's constraint. 
[02:29:30]  What is this?  These are a few of my favorite things.  Tuning up people with certain complexions.  Women's abuse joke give me huge corrections.  Hazing the suspect until he sings.  These are a few of my favorite things.  He's doing a Club Soda Kenny impression.  Are you still it?  Do it now.  Put your hands behind your back.  Do it now. 
[02:30:00]  Do it now or you're going to get back in the game.  That's funny.  Do it now.  Do it now.  Purple of lead made everybody wonder.  I shot him four times.  A nice even number.  Dropping the hoodlum thugs of all their bling.  That is one of my favorite things.  Pulliings and threatenings and high speed pursuits.  The Rodney King beating.  Now that was a hoot.  Using the perks that authority brings. 
[02:30:30]  These were a few of my favorite things.  You should get Kenny to sing it.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh, hit him with the baton.  Oh, that was funny.  I talk like a goon.  My hair, it's a bath mat.  I'm nine feet tall and I look like an asshat.  Happily wait for a douchebag to fling. 
[02:31:00]  That is one of my favorite things.  I'm big and scary.  I'll boil a hold up.  Like Herman Munster without any makeup.  This song will play and I can't even sing.  That is one of my favorite things.  Oh, that's funny. 
[02:31:30]  That's funny, G.H.  Are we done?  I have to go get G.H.'s Parfait.  Okay, terrific.  I gotta say, I think it was well written.  Yeah.  Very well written.  It's only because we have Kenny here.  We would probably have rather had Kenny sing it just because Kenny is available. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, because that was a really bad Kenny impression.  It was odd.  He sounded like he was just singing the Monster Mash.  Yeah.  I like to hit with phone books.  What did Judah Friedlander think?  I think it's a little mixed.  He sounded a little tired, a little more energy, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a little more rehearsing there.  It didn't quite have it.  It didn't quite bring it, man.  Yeah, I wasn't feeling the singing portion of it, the impression. 
[02:32:30]  The lyrics were all right.  The lyrics would have been good.  If Kenny was singing that, that would have been good, you know, big dope singing.  Well, okay.  Maybe we'll figure that out.  Here's the Vince impression.  Oh, cool.  Ah, good.  This is Vince doing Anthony's impression of him.  Yeah.  But he used to not do it this way.  Which is the new Vince.  The new Vince now.  Vince, which he's basically doing Anthony doing Vince.  It's my over-the-top impression of him, man. 
[02:33:00]  I hate you.  Totally.  And all the rest of you people can go straight to hell.  He never used to do that.  No.  I'm telling you.  That's hysterical.  These guys have been sending the audio to the WWE, and I think, and they said that  Vince enjoys Anthony's impression.  We're like, yeah, like he's really listening to this stuff you're sending him.  But I guess he is, yeah.  Because he never used to do that.  He definitely changed his hair.  Straight to hell.  Yeah, he used to be straight to hell.  Hell.  He used to really give it all. 
[02:33:30]  Right.  Well, that's cool, dude.  Yeah.  That's an honor, man.  Yeah, that's something.  I'm serious.  It really is.  Vince is the man.  You like wrestling?  Yeah, man.  Do you really?  Yeah, I love wrestling.  What do you like about it?  Those folks out there.  This is cool, man.  I like, you know, it's just the acrobatics, the slutty chicks.  Make sure you say the slutty chicks.  Yeah.  That's what I was getting at.  Instead of the half-nude men.  Yeah, that always gets a little weird. 
[02:34:00]  That part is tolerable.  Yeah.  But wrestling's pretty cool, man.  All right.  Hey, we got a big studio audience today.  Are they mic'd today out there?  No?  I'm not sure.  We got a huge studio audience.  They're all filling out way too much paperwork.  It's that paperwork thing.  I walked in, and there were two guys.  Where are they?  They're just sitting there with, like, just pages and pages of stuff.  And I'm like, why are you guys filling that out?  I thought they were a band performing or something.  And they go, we don't know. 
[02:34:30]  They don't know why.  They seem to be enjoying it, though.  They're not enjoying it.  They just want to come here and laugh and check out the whole scene.  How many pages is it?  Hey, Paul.  Master Paul.  Can I see a copy of what they have to fill out, please?  Thank you, sir.  Everything they have to fill out.  Cool.  And he takes it so seriously.  These kids are, like, pulling out driver's licenses.  Oh, I know.  And it's just like an application just to check out the show.  They don't do this when you go see Letterman. 
[02:35:00]  Why?  I used to go see Letterman every once in a while in my family.  You just walk in.  You're not filling out shit.  No.  If you're a guest, you fill this out.  He's screaming at me.  I'm sorry.  Why, though?  Everyone that enters this studio has to fill it out.  Why do we have the same guest filling it out time and time again?  Like, Red Rum and her husband have been here.  They have to fill this out again or no?  Yeah.  Red Rum and the husband, yes.  Why?  They've been here already.  Different dates.  Why not just re-sign the same piece of paper?  It's silly.  Who?  But you have different dates and it has to be. 
[02:35:30]  Who decided this?  But no, no.  How about just, how about this?  They get the paperwork and then you staple a dossier of them together.  So, whatever her name is, Red Rum.  Dossier.  You go to R and then you have Red Rum and then you just put a new date and she signs it.  It takes three seconds.  It's the same paperwork.  What are some of the questions?  What's a dossier?  These kids were sweating like they were taking the SATs out there.  It's a stupid radio show.  We make dick jokes.  Each piece of paper has its own date and signature.  Each piece of paper, what do you mean?  Each piece of paper has its own date and signature. 
[02:36:00]  Well, they shouldn't have to refill out their name and address.  Does she have to put it this way?  Her phone number and picture ID number.  They have to pull that every time?  Yes.  So, why would her?  For this company.  But why?  It hasn't changed.  For this company.  This has been going on for three years.  Oh, we understand that.  And for three years we're trying to get this changed because it's too much work for our listeners.  Let's see.  Maybe Steve can explain what DFL is.  What is DFL media?  Oh, don't even get into that part of it.  Oh, don't even get into that part of it.  We're being hijacked by Steve, basically. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Steve owns us.  That's Steve extorting.  Steve's a mere year away from completely owning us and our likeness.  Why do they have to fill this stuff out every time?  Oh, boy.  Now that Jimmy's on to this, oh, boy.  What?  I'm still trying to figure out what dossier means, Jim.  Dossier.  Dossier.  Dossier.  I think it's a French word for a dossie.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  Something like that.  Oh, I know.  That is a release form for video for Steve. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, I can't post pictures online of anybody, especially in certain situations.  Yes, don't say we.  All right.  All right.  Oh, don't get mad at me.  I'm not getting mad.  Look at it.  Yes, you are.  I'm not getting mad, but I know that.  Yeah, I saw you getting mad.  These conversations have a tendency to get accusatory in nature, so before they do, I'm simply stating  that the paperwork has to get done.  When have I ever accusitated?  I'm not saying you, but Jim gets these, why does this have to get done? 
[02:37:30]  Oh, good.  I'm telling you exactly why it has to get done, and it can't change.  It's got to get done.  You were doing a Jimmy impression.  When you post a photo or video of someone online, especially in a compromising situation,  you have to have records and proof of their age.  I understand that, but they're not going to get younger.  What I'm saying is, if somebody comes in, my issue is not somebody having to fill out  their age for video.  My issue is the redundancy.  Like, if they fill this out the first time for XM, why not just have a dossier with the 
[02:38:00]  person, like, say, Red Rumble's been here, so she doesn't have to fill out her name,  her phone number, date of birth.  It's just redundant idiocy.  If they want to just re-sign her name with a new date.  We can do that.  I just, you know, but I'm not in charge of the paperwork process.  That's all.  All right, well, that was really...  What does DFL mean?  Is that you?  Not being accusatory.  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  You own this stuff? 
[02:38:30]  Shared content.  Yeah, if I got to post it, it's shared, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, why don't we have fun?  Scroll, scroll.  I'm totally confused.  I'm playing Steve.  Who wants a BlackBerry up the ass?  Ooh.  Oh, hey.  My hands up.  Mike, I perceive that as a threat.  Take care of business.  I think he's in a BlackBerry.  Sorry.  May I suggest the bullet go right here.  We got the TMZ star in studio today.  He's no longer Madonna Mike. 
[02:39:00]  He's the TMZ star right there.  They did TMZ for the people that don't pay attention to that show.  They did a whole piece of Madonna, and you saw more of our own Mike than Madonna.  Well, he takes care of business.  And I'd send off a little email to you, a little text, and you said, Jesus, what the fuck?  Everyone's texting me right now.  Because you were all over TMZ.  Oh, we got the freak from CNN.  Great.  All right.  What are we doing?  So we got Money Honey.  They're filling out their paperwork.  Who are the women, Doug, getting naked?  God.  For the love of God, don't raise your hand. 
[02:39:30]  A little visual joke for everybody today.  For the love of God, keep your hand down.  All right.  Good so far.  Maybe she hurt us, too.  All right.  Good.  She's not part of the contest.  Oh, which one?  Which one?  Sandy Kane?  Who's the girl up front?  Next to Red Room.  Hi.  Raise your hand if you're in the Money Honey contest.  Oh, all right.  We got a couple of hot ones.  Ew.  Then we got Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane and Patty.  Wait, wait.  What's that one look like? 
[02:40:00]  Who's the girl on the back?  Bring her over here.  Let me see that one.  I know.  She's filling out paperwork, but tell her she's got to do something to the radio station first.  We can look at you without you having to...  All right.  Hot.  All right.  Okay.  She's very hot.  Hot, not, and...  No, they're both hot.  All right.  What's your name?  There you go.  There you go.  Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Hi.  And who's your friend?  Sue.  Where are you guys from?  West Springfield, Mass.  Really?  All right.  Yeah, we got some legitimate girls for this.  I'm from Philly.  No, that's all right.  Very nice.  Philly and West Springfield, Massachusetts.  And then stalker Patty. 
[02:40:30]  I need money for my rent and my electric and my phone bill and the heat and the water  and the cat food and clothes and...  She's always perpetually broke.  Because I spend it on things like satellite radio.  I mean, thank you and all, but...  Jesus Christ.  Eat.  Yeah, and she's got nothing to say.  Great.  Thanks for adding to the show.  Yeah.  Okay, great.  That's good, Patty.  On cue, cackle idiotically. 
[02:41:00]  And pal talk so she could broadcast from the mausoleum she lives in.  Why do you bother even turning the camera on?  It's just...  First of all, no one would want to see it, but it's just a blackness.  It's so dark in your...  Do you have any windows or lights on?  I have one window.  And ah, who cares?  And I did buy a lamp so you can see me better.  Could you throw it in the bathtub when you're bathing?  Thank you.  I love you, too.  Ah, ha-hoo.  Wow, she's got snappy comebacks. 
[02:41:30]  All right, here we go.  That's right.  The freaky 12-year-old that we just saw on CNN, we got the audio.  He's seven foot tall.  He's 12.  Where does he live?  It's great.  Medical mystery here.  A 12-year-old boy just keeps growing, growing beyond his years.  She's already nearly seven feet tall.  More now from Marie Medina of our affiliate, K-I-M-A.  This is Brendan.  At just four months old, Brendan Adams had all of his teeth.  And he looks like an eight-year-old kid. 
[02:42:00]  In kindergarten, now it's as tall as the 14 years.  Look.  All right.  See?  Okay.  Look, we've done this bit.  Awesome.  We've done this bit so many times verbatim.  Yeah, but he's got, like, too many teeth in his mouth.  He's had teeth at four months all of his teeth were in.  What a fuck-toothed idiot.  I like how they call it medical mystery.  That's like the news's polite way of saying freak.  Freak show.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, behind this very curtain, that's what they're doing. 
[02:42:30]  They're selling a freak show.  They're calling it medical mystery.  Medical mystery.  Next up, pickled punks.  Medical mystery.  And it's the same thing we go on.  Well, when I was 12 years old, I...  Yeah.  Look at that friggin' voice that...  Poor kid.  The air has to travel too far from the lungs to the vocal cords.  Picks up some bass.  Teeth.  And he looks like an eight-year-old kid.  In kindergarten, now it's as tall as the four skaters. 
[02:43:00]  As the years went on, Brendan just kept growing, so...  We gotta keep stopping this, because it is our bit.  Yeah, that's the bit.  In kindergarten, I was as tall as the fourth graders.  The fourth graders, I kept growing, but I wanted to be a normal kid.  What'd you do?  Well, I skateboarded and rollerbladed.  I did everything I could.  I like to play baseball like any other kid.  Well, they wouldn't let me play basketball.  That's right.  The strike zone was my ankles.  But, you know, I just play.  I'm a normal kid.  That's what I like to do. 
[02:43:30]  I sound like, you know, a grown man, but I'm just a kid.  I like doing things.  I like eating candy.  It's fun.  Throwing it up in the air and popping it in my mouth.  Unless it goes in the ceiling fan.  Not the candy in my head.  You know what I really want to know?  If he had all his teeth at four months, you'd think he was jerking off by three years old.  I feel like they would have started straightening them sooner.  That's 12 years with that fucking buck-toothed mouth.  They're just about sticking straight out at a 90-degree angle to his gums. 
[02:44:00]  It's like someone hit the garage door open and his teeth lifted.  He's a buck-toothed boob with a little fucking head.  And shut eyes.  I enjoy not opening my eyes and eating apples straight off the tree.  You fucking, you awful leaf eater.  He's a fucking leaf eater, this kid.  He makes me sick from my stomach.  They're going to put him in a 5'11 room.  That'll straighten him out.  You want to stop him growing?  Make him wear the same shoes.  Don't get his shoes any bigger. 
[02:44:30]  They look like Tippy Toms.  All fat, just packed in there.  This kid's a fucking big lurking giraffe.  What a fucking...  Giving everyone the creeps.  No one likes him.  Every fucking photo has him like a giant fucking...  Just like a guy...  A fucking weed sticking up.  A fucking buck-toothed weed.  He looks like a young lurch.  Yeah, he absolutely does.  He's got that lurch look.  But he's uglier and with a worse voice.  Now it's as tall as the four skaters.  As the years went on, Brendan just kept growing. 
[02:45:00]  So basically, in two and a half years, you grew 15 inches?  Yeah.  And growing.  Six years difference, and he's just as tall as his brother.  To get an idea of just how tall Brendan is, I'm 5'7", and he's nearly 7 feet tall.  And the reason why he's getting so much attention, Brendan's only 12.  To give you an idea of how tall he is, he had his teeth clipped by the wing of a 7'27".  Fucking... 
[02:45:30]  How dumb does that reporter sound?  She just sounds like such a moron.  I'm 5'7".  He's almost 7 feet tall.  She's actually 7 feet's of height we've never heard.  We all watch basketball, you cunt.  We know how tall he is.  She's acting like he's 83 feet tall.  Here's a relative comparison.  He's walking by the Chrysler building.  Fucking stupid bitch.  We understand 7 feet's very big.  He's a big boy.  He kept growing and growing. 
[02:46:00]  To give you an idea of how big he is, I'm going to yawn while he rapes my mouth.  Fucking idiot.  Shut up.  Jimmy should be getting a huge laugh from the crowd.  Where's their mic?  How can they?  With Tom's feet out there.  There's just nothing fun.  Where is Tom?  To punish them for that bad reaction, I think Tom's shoe should come over.  Don't bring him in here because this room smells nice.  He's so tall.  Wait, where is Tom?  He's right there.  Oh, God.  The room smells good.  Keiko's shoe should come off as a punishment. 
[02:46:30]  These guys should...  Right over there.  These guys should smell what we were smelling all morning and we should get a nice fucking  crowd reaction.  That's what we want to talk.  I want to sit in the middle of the bleachers.  I want to sit in the bleachers.  Mike, why is he...  What?  For your birthday.  You got your...  Yeah, Mike.  What's wrong with you?  Mike?  It's your 40th.  We got you something special.  Yeah.  I'll do a little strip tease, man.  Why is he here?  He should be out there.  He should be out there.  We want to get... 
[02:47:00]  Yes!  Hold on.  We want to get the reaction of the crowd when they smell what we were smelling all day.  Bring him in there.  Tom's a good boy.  We're sitting there, Tom.  You're fucking relaxing.  You're a star.  Oh, you just got hit with it?  Hey.  No, do it out there, Keiko.  Let's do it out there.  Hey, is the crowd mic'd?  Danny, hit that.  I want to make sure it's on.  Okay.  Oh, Danny whistled.  All right.  All right.  He whistled.  All right.  Ready for this reaction?  Go ahead, Tom.  You're fine.  Take your shoes off.  And take your fucking...  All right.  All right. 
[02:47:30]  Take your briefcase.  Take your Toomey luggage.  We got at least...  Toomey luggage.  Toomey luggage.  Toomey luggage.  Toomey luggage.  I was making the T sound already.  Fucking leapfrog me.  God, sucker.  He doesn't understand the concept of taking his shoes off.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, shit.  He left his feet in him.  We got at least 20 people on the...  We got at least 20 people on the bleachers ready for it.  When he runs at the steps, it's going to be like a nightmare on Elm Street. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  The feet.  They don't know.  They're reacting.  They haven't even smelled it.  They're playing games, these people.  Take a seat on the bleachers, Tom.  Take a seat on the bleachers, Tom.  He should enjoy the show like anyone else.  There he goes.  They don't know yet.  They don't know.  Yeah, they're kind of like...  Wait till that smell.  Wait off with you shitty acting folks.  Now you know what I'm saying.  They're sliding over.  My name's Timmy Tom.  My name's Timmy Tom. 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  You know what's so funny?  He's such a classy guy for a homeless degenerate.  Welcome to the Timmy Tom Show.  He's a rotting gentleman.  Oh, now they're getting it.  Yeah, wait.  Now they're getting it.  Wait till you mean smelly Kelly.  He's showing up tonight.  He's playing the room.  I love Tom.  He's as good as La Mata.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got everybody showing up tonight.  Damn right we do.  Attaboy, Tom.  You relax.  You relax and enjoy yourself, Tom, like anybody else out there. 
[02:49:00]  Why is everybody covering their mouths?  In a boxing match right now, though.  I don't get it.  Everyone's covering their nose.  By the way, I don't like the fact that your shoes stay in here.  A man likes to...  You know what?  Leave his shoes here.  Timmy Tom can't get a word in there.  I'm sorry, Tom.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Go.  You go.  Well, what I'm saying is this.  Is that...  I was real happy right there.  Out of mind of it.  Out there, you're a star.  Nah, you sit with your people. 
[02:49:30]  You sit with your fans.  I'm happy wherever I go.  Attaboy, Tom.  Whatever I do, I'm always with me.  What you guys are smelling is the Christmas spirit.  Yeah.  The rotting Christmas spirit.  You're just going to figure it out.  Tom.  Tom.  Don't be a bunch of Grinches.  Do you see any...  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  Tom.  He thinks it's God.  Tom.  Do you see...  No, stay where you are. 
[02:50:00]  Stay where you are.  Stay where you are.  Yeah, get up and sit down a few times.  That ought to get the smell going.  I just want to know.  Ask Tom if he sees any pretty girls out there.  Tom, they want to know if you see any pretty girls out here.  Too many of them.  What are you, crazy?  You know, I mean...  Which girl...  I'm losing my mind.  What girl you think is pretty?  It's coming.  Which girl do you think is pretty?  Look around.  They want to know which one.  Yeah, look around first.  What? 
[02:50:30]  Take one out?  Take one out.  That's what it's hard to do.  Take a look.  Her right here.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's what you don't want to see in a subway, huh?  Her right here.  Oh, shit.  But just throw yourself on the third rail.  I told you to be good-looking women, man.  What am I going to do about this?  I'm going to have to jerk off.  I'm going to have to jerk off.  Mind if I pull my junk out and jerk off? 
[02:51:00]  Too many of them.  I'm getting a great idea from Pickled Punk from frunkus.net or whatever they are.  I'm not really sure.  From Nevada.  Opie, Radio Gold would be...  I'm going to adjust what he's saying.  Basically, I think we should get Tippi Tom in the Money Honey contest with the hot women.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  You're right.  He's better look.  He'd never be able to clean himself. 
[02:51:30]  He'd be stuck out on the street like honey.  Bees would just come and nest in him.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Here's the rest of...  All right.  Good enough for Tom for now.  We got more of the 12-year-old that's 7 foot tall.  Leave him out there.  Shut the door.  A little more from the 12-year-old that's 7 foot tall.  In the past couple years, simple tasks have gotten a lot harder.  I'm pretty much sure if you're a place I go, I have to duck.  Brendan finally stopped growing this year, but he's got other medical conditions like extremely large joints. 
[02:52:00]  Just to get him with socks on, it's kind of hard.  No problem.  But doctors can't explain it, so they can't treat him.  And they can't reassure his family Brendan will live a long life.  But if you ask Brendan...  I don't know.  He doesn't really give you many answers, because to him, he's just like any other 12-year-old boy.  I'm a little better in basketball than some others.  You know, we're told some of Brendan's family friends just held a fundraiser so they can help buy furniture big enough for him. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  How about just buy two of everything and put them together, you fucking assholes?  How about two sofas?  Furniture big enough for him.  I know.  A 30-foot bed.  Fuck him.  Get in a single and fucking learn to be uncomfortable.  The whole world isn't going to bend because you can't stop sprouting up, you fucking show-off.  You fucking kid's a show-off.  I hope they get him a beanbag chair.  Make him have to get up from the floor.  Make him wear it as a hat. 
[02:53:00]  Can you hide that fucking brontosaurus skull?  You're fucking creeping everybody out.  You sure are, you fucking Cro-Magnon-toothed fool.  Ghoul.  Hey, Java Man teeth, shut your fucking mouth and open your eyes.  How about that?  Fucking stupid little bird.  Jim, he's just like any other kid.  Come on.  Just like any other 12-year-old.  That's what I do.  I go to school, do whatever it takes to be just like a normal boy.  I like playing basketball.  A little better than most.  I'm like every other 40-year-old Redwood. 
[02:53:30]  You know, sometimes he'll drill a hole through me and drive traffic through it.  Fucking 40-year-old.  Lumbering ox.  Shut up.  Probably 500 years old.  Whatever.  I mean, they're tall by the time they're.  They're not 500 feet.  They're not 7 feet by 5.  By 40, they're about 7 feet.  I'll salvage that.  He'll put his rings around his big, gigantic boy feet.  To fucking hit his tootsies.  By the way, half the crowd out there is just holding their noses.  Yeah, they're putting scarves and jackets, whatever they can get in front of their noses. 
[02:54:00]  Tom's feet are right in Sandy's jacket.  I couldn't.  Sandy doesn't even care.  Yeah, why should she?  Sandy doesn't care.  Tom's feet care.  I'm chilling.  Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  What do you think of Tippy Tom?  I think the show stinks today, folks.  I get it.  But he just asked me out.  He said he wants to take me to a shelter tonight.  Do you think I should go?  Yeah.  Would you suck his cock?  Definitely.  Yeah?  Can I do that song, Let Me Suck Your Cock, to him today? 
[02:54:30]  If you really suck his cock.  Yeah, of course.  How about this?  Would you want me to do it right on the show?  Yeah, how about this?  Do I have to swallow?  No, how about this?  You think she would really do this?  No.  If you must suck...  Do I have to swallow?  Oh, she's just fucking worthless.  All right, Tippy Tom, come on in here.  Get Tippy Tom back on the plastic.  I'm going to get a blowjob.  That door!  That door!  Other door.  Yes, the other door.  It's common sense.  It's common sense, motherfuckers.  You're cheering because Tom's leaving the area. 
[02:55:00]  Wait a minute.  Maybe we should make Tom a bubble boy.  Make him walk right through.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Imagine the noxious air.  It's just because he smells so bad.  You got to make him a bubble boy.  It's just because he stinks.  You know how bad it would smell all concentrated in that bubble?  That'd be awesome.  If you watch it like a slow motion breakdown, his shoes are actually trying to walk themselves  away and trying to sneak out.  He has time-lapse photography.  You just see him moving.  They're moving.  It's like a poltergeist.  There's tears coming out of the laces.  All right.  Here comes Tippy Tom. 
[02:55:30]  We got to call out Sandy Kane for once.  She's not going to say that.  Am I going to get shot?  That's a mafia hit because of the plastic on the floor.  He thinks he's going to get peschied.  He's a funny fucking guy.  You're a made man.  A lot of people say he sounds like Al Pacino, by the way.  Yes.  A homeless Al Pacino.  Yeah.  Pacino.  Scarfeet.  Scarfeet.  I like Anthony more than Opie.  Ah.  Let's clear that one up.  Great.  Good.  Wonderful.  That's great. 
[02:56:00]  So you're not alone.  That's good.  Now sit down.  All right.  Take a seat on the plastic.  Hey, Tom, you want your dick sucked today?  I don't want to be too nasty, but Tippy Tom would like to have a few words.  Okay.  And I'm going to say thank you all for letting me come over here.  Just a decrepit gentleman.  Why do you like Anthony more than me?  I can't hear you.  Why do you like Anthony more than me?  Why do I like Anthony more than Howard Stern?  That's a good question.  What? 
[02:56:30]  What?  Well, because you let me in.  He don't.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hey, Cabbage Patch, pal.  I'm not going to get an answer from this guy.  The man Howard Stern, yeah.  I got on this show.  Get Sandy Kane in here.  Huh?  Get Sandy Kane in here.  Sandy.  Sandy.  There we go.  Sandy.  There we go.  Sandy Kane.  You would actually name him.  Yeah, go sit next to Tom.  I can't believe it's the worst people alive. 
[02:57:00]  Should I go topless?  Yes, please.  Feel free.  Whatever you want to do.  I think I'll light my tits up for him.  All right.  Well, I go topless too, you know.  Go ahead, Tom.  All right, go topless for...  Okay, can you light your tits up too?  All right.  Well, give me some lights, yeah.  All right, Tibby Tom.  She's right here.  Tibby Tom, she's topless.  You might as well be topless.  Keith, you got to be the translator.  This is killing us today.  You want to take your coat off? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, get comfortable.  Oh, Sam, thank you.  I have a new coat for you.  Take that one off.  All right.  It's a good coat, though.  It's a good coat, though.  It's rotting off your body, Tom.  It can't be that good.  Tom, you want to be topless?  He's wearing the same sweatshirt from Rocky 1.  You guys don't know I'm a male dancer, do you?  All right, well, why don't you start dancing?  Because you're sitting next to a stripper.  He's got a big dick, man.  He's got a big dick.  Now, you do have a beautiful cock.  Do you think he does?  Yeah, because I, you know, I did work in peep shows. 
[02:58:00]  This man, when I looked, you know, the rest of his body, you know, but his thighs are nice.  And he has a guy that's got a nice dick.  What's nice about it?  It's just, like, nice and big and juicy looking.  All right, let's take it.  Juicy looking.  I can't give me that high award, but thank you.  Hey, Rock, how about we mic Sandy Kane when she's there?  That might be the best part of your whole body.  Jesus.  Look at the frightened looks on the face of the people in the audience. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, I know.  Yeah, they're petrified.  We kind of got a love connection happening here.  You have a big dick, man.  Show him.  Are you Irish or what?  Tippi!  Keith, please translate.  Tell Tippi that to show Sandy Kane.  There's a MetroCard thing hanging off his head.  Yeah.  How do you expect to make sense of this?  It's a MetroCard.  The man has a MetroCard holder hanging off his head.  I love the frustration that comes with having Tippi Tom in studio.  I really do.  Yeah, because there's no directing him or anything. 
[02:59:00]  And it's like a challenge.  It's like doing a video game or something.  You really want to get past this level.  I like watching it on the TV screens here.  He can't take it off.  He's been trying to get this MetroCard off his head for five minutes.  Yeah, he's playing tug of war with lice.  Skull crawling.  Wow, that's good.  He's got a suit on underneath his rock.  Look at that suit jacket.  He's like one of those oldie time bums from I Love Lucy.  That's Chuck Beres' suit. 
[02:59:30]  Chuck Beres' suit.  He's got a suit jacket on.  I'm a hobo.  I'm a go-go dancer.  All right.  Well, he...  Wow, I guess he's...  Do you like oral sex?  Of course.  Oh, good.  His beard looks like a mullet.  Do you like 69?  Maybe you do me while I do you.  How do you do?  I'm an old-fashioned guy.  Do you like 69?  Is that old-fashioned?  Yeah.  I'm going to take a girl out for dinner.  Then shit my pants and rust.  Do you like doggy style? 
[03:00:00]  Like my pa before me.  He's a sexual being, you know?  He's an old-fashioned guy.  Why not?  Did you ever fuck a woman in a shelter?  Oh.  Yeah, put it right in her shelter.  Okay.  I don't think his mic's on.  Tippy Tom's mic isn't working.  We have that?  Well, yeah.  Steve!  Unless his breath melted the fucking copper-top battery.  E-Rock, yours is on.  Yeah.  You got to realize, if one mic isn't working, the other one's going to have to take up the  slack. 
[03:00:30]  Back and forth between the two.  I'm glad you like oral sex.  I'm glad you like oral sex.  And you have beautiful blue eyes.  Look at his beautiful eyes.  Thank you for the compliment.  Those are cataracts or junkists or something.  I like Irishmen.  And you're very well in that.  They say Irishmen have small dicks.  Not him.  Not you.  He's got a jacket, suit jacket, then something else, and then a vest.  More like a black man, baby.  He's wearing a flower lei.  He has a cross on, too.  Yeah, yeah.  He's dressed for his funeral. 
[03:01:00]  When was the last time you had your dick sucked?  Mr. Hanalee.  Tom, take your jacket off, baby.  Take your other jacket off.  Take your jacket off, baby.  This guy's got a lot of layers to him.  Let me get naked here.  Attaboy.  That's a bunny.  All right.  Now what has he got on under his suit jacket?  He has a Hawaiian luau thing.  Yeah.  He must have liked a luau night or something.  That's in summer.  He's got like a...  Oh, boy.  He's got a flannel on.  And what else?  Don't blame me.  Is that half a flannel or is that another layer? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  It's a whole other layer.  All right.  All right.  He's got another jacket.  We're pulling off.  Fucking Keith is amazing.  Keith is just right in there, man.  Now the flannel's coming off.  Now we're down to the Hawaiian lei across.  And an orange shirt.  And an orange shirt.  He's got some bling, too.  All right.  Now what?  Now he's taking off his...  That's a bling.  Woo!  Sexy.  A lei.  Now you want me to dance?  Yeah, you can leave your album.  All right.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Quiet, Iraq.  Come on.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  There it is. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  His belly button's like almost level with his jacket.  His tits.  Yeah.  How does that happen?  All right.  Now he's dancing.  All right.  Now he's dancing.  Why don't Sandy and Tom dance together?  How about a slow dance for the couple?  Yeah.  How about we do a slow dance?  How can I boogie without the music?  Sandy.  All right.  We'll get some music for you.  What's wrong?  How can I boogie without the music?  How can I boogie?  I'm a crispy kiss of my body.  Yeah, you think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby.  Let me go.  Can we crank out to Ron Stewart for the guy?  So he hears it?  Don't take your food out. 
[03:02:30]  That's all right.  All right.  We got Tippy Tom.  He's topless.  Sandy King's topless.  Do a little hoofing.  And they're going to do a little hoof together.  Do you suck titties, baby?  Of course I do.  Irish men are very sexy.  This is a love connection.  By the way, I would love to send them just like this to a restaurant.  Germany, huh?  Would that be hysterical?  Well, my name's Schultz.  All right.  What are we doing here?  The crowd is horrified.  Yeah, Sergeant Schultz. 
[03:03:00]  Hogan's hero.  All right.  I'm going to finish the show.  Where's the music?  Do we have music?  We need some romantic music.  Come on.  Right now.  They have to dance.  Tommy can dance.  Fucking music.  We need a nice, slow song.  We're going to music, yeah.  Hold on.  We're getting it for you.  It's coming.  Music is coming.  How about Lady in Red?  That's always a good song.  I like that.  Excellent idea.  Let's play that.  Lady in Red, because Sandy Kane's got kind of a red.  A slow dance?  Yeah.  Hold on, Sandy.  I'm a Hanukkah bush.  You want to eat me tonight?  Eight times.  All right.  They're going to dance.  He's a lesbian. 
[03:03:30]  He wants to eat out.  You like those titties there, Tippy Tom?  Of course I like eating them.  All right.  Here we go.  You guys do a little slow dance.  Let's go.  Can they hear this?  Yeah.  All right.  You guys do a little dance.  We eat out every night.  We eat out every night.  All right.  Here it is for their very first dance ever.  Tippy Tom.  And Sandy Kane.  And Sandy Kane.  Yes.  Hug them, Sandy.  It's a fucking slow dance.  That's not close enough.  More presentation.  Okay.  Very good. 
[03:04:00]  All right.  They're slow dancing.  He's slow dancing with him.  Ew.  He's kind of making it out with her.  This ain't a case of true, bro.  Don't you stop him, Sandy.  Let him do what he wants.  Can I show my crack here?  Yes, you can.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Tippy Tom.  I'm going to have a good time.  All right.  Tippy Tom.  I'm going to have a good time.  Atta girl. 
[03:04:30]  You know, this is how I always imagined this song.  Yeah.  Just like this, right?  Yeah.  This is how I always imagined it.  Caroline, why was this not the video?  Why was this not the music video to this song?  They did good.  Yeah, it definitely should have been.  How about it?  Guys, how about a little peck?  A little kiss?  Show us a little peck.  A little kiss.  This is a love song.  Come on, man.  Kiss my pussy.  How about a little kiss?  It doesn't have a nose.  Sandy, how about a little kiss?  My pussy has no nose.  Kiss my nose.  My pussy doesn't have a nose.  My pussy has no nose. 
[03:05:00]  It's got an ear, though.  I can't.  Kiss my pussy.  Go ahead.  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  All right.  Well, we're hearing this is the sickest thing.  Turn down the music.  So we can hear.  Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom is looking at.  My pussy has no nose.  I'm kissing pussy.  You're going to kiss pussy.  That camera right there, then.  That's got to be kept.  No, believe it.  But people in front of it.  I didn't get the clit. 
[03:05:30]  I didn't know that.  Are we going to go that way?  Look, I washed my hands.  Everything's cool.  In what?  Garbage juice?  Even a homeless guy knows how to talk again.  I washed my hands.  Everything's cool.  Do you have a rod?  Grab his rod.  Sandy threw the pants.  Don't take much to get me going.  Oh, fuck.  Sandy's 20-11 at Timmy Tom's rod.  You want a titty fuck?  You want a titty fuck or what?  Of course.  Well, that might be later.  Okay, okay. 
[03:06:00]  Wait, Tippy Tom.  I work from the feet up.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  Well, that's how your body's rotting, too, so.  Keith.  You got to watch the camera.  Thanks.  All right, man.  I'm trying to get some...  Sorry, Tom.  Sorry, Tom.  I'm Jesus.  I'm so titty-titty.  I'm so titty-titty.  Hey, hey, hey.  Let him go down on you there.  Okay, okay.  I knew Anthony would come up with something.  All right.  Go ahead, Tom.  It's all right.  Show how you...  Show how you lick that box. 
[03:06:30]  Holy shit.  The smell just got over to me.  Holy shit.  I'll take the breast first.  Wow, it is here.  So does my pussy, so it's cool.  Oh, man.  This is my best.  I haven't raised in a wig.  It's cool.  Sounds good.  It does.  It does.  All right, cool.  You like tuna fish?  Well, I like every kind of fish.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Can we stop the snappy banter, please?  All right.  How about...  Jimmy.  I'm trying to eat some pussy here, guys.  All right.  Well, you're up a little too high. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're by her face.  What happened?  I don't know.  She turned around.  I'm down here.  We'll eat the pussy a little later.  All right.  Here we go.  It's a private thing.  All right.  It's a private thing.  You're fucking...  You shit in public.  It's up to her.  Now, I was a centipole, man.  You were a centipole.  Yes, in Black Monthly.  Right.  Black Monthly.  But, so anyway, twat. 
[03:07:30]  So twat.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Anything comes.  I mean, anything goes.  Take a lick.  How about just a kiss?  Not even a lick.  Sandy Cain.  Okay, what?  Is he sporting?  He's got a big, big heart on.  Yeah.  Ooh, nice.  Well, it's not that big.  Not that big.  If you want my body.  Yeah.  Very big, son.  Yeah, it's not that big.  My grandmother gave it to me. 
[03:08:00]  This is so sick.  This is exactly how Jalen Spears got pregnant.  Santa Cain has her legs wide open as she's laying back on the couch.  Tom is standing shirtless in between her legs.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Yeah.  And I mean that.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen.  Oh, by the way, Santa Cain, he's HIV.  No, he's not.  I don't know.  Keith, is he HIV or what?  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  He's clean?  Okay.  Oh, that was all bullshit?  Oh, all right.  Come on, baby.  Keith's saying he's clean.  That's the noise of Timmy Town.  Yeah, he's in there.  This is the worst show.  He is in there.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That was really good.  I guess he's Tom's rocking it.  Now we're stuck to the chips.  Now I've stuck to tits. 
[03:09:00]  I thought he was gay.  I guess we're learning a lot about him today.  Oh, because I'm a gigolo.  Yeah, you know.  All right, they're negotiating.  But E-Rock doesn't know how to work a fucking mic.  Yeah, I know.  You know, how come you don't have a hairy chest when you shave or what?  Jesus Christ.  Wow, I can't bring you home to my mother.  Here's Jesus.  See, he loves us.  Well, I found it.  Well, he loves you.  He loves you, man. 
[03:09:30]  He loves you.  Ooh, the smell just came over even more.  Yeah, it's horrendous.  All right, what's going on now over there, Sandy Kane?  You're going to let him crack a window?  Okay, okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Break, you haven't done anything.  What is he doing?  Mike Hurf.  I just need to sit down for a second here, because I've been licking some, trying to lick some  pussy here.  What the fuck?  Ow!  No, it smells good!  I thought it might smell. 
[03:10:00]  Because, you know...  She's worried about the smell of her pussy.  I have...  You know, my pussy is black.  I have big lips, kinky hair, and it smells like fried chicken.  Your pussy look pink to me.  Okay.  Are black women's pussies pink?  He would know.  Can we go...  Black women got pink pussies, too.  Jim would know.  What?  Because they have black women, they have pink pussies?  Yeah, they're beautiful.  Okay, so...  All right.  Why do they got pink pussies?  All right, uh...  They're the black women.  Why are Tom's pants down?  White women, yeah, but I don't know why. 
[03:10:30]  Why are Tom's pants down?  Yeah, Tom...  I don't know this stuff.  Tom.  Tom, you should, uh...  You should pull your pants down.  Yeah, pull your pants down for her.  So she can just touch.  Just to the knees.  She just wants...  Pull it all down?  Yeah.  Yeah, she just wants to touch it.  She just wants to touch it.  We're hooking you up.  You don't have to show your legs or anything.  Yeah, I do.  Let's see your dick.  You're locked up for having a little dick.  No, you're locked up.  Yeah.  It's nice and big.  I liked it.  No.  Christ.  It's reasonable.  It's reasonable.  Everyday handyman use.  You're constantly in the way of my camera angles.  It's big, man. 
[03:11:00]  Let's see.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Come on.  It's radio.  No one's watching.  I don't care if you're watching or not.  All right, let's see.  Hey, help me up here.  All right, here's Tom.  He's holding on, Eric, and getting up.  He's working his...  No, it's reasonable.  He's a man who shits his pants and wear his cock.  Fuck you, dick.  He's working his dick to make sure it has good presentation when he pulls his pants down.  Wait a minute.  I'm your average handyman.  All right.  All right.  Let's see, Tom.  All right.  Go ahead.  Show Sandy King. 
[03:11:30]  Don't wave it at us.  Wave it at her.  Nice ass.  Look at nice ass.  Wait.  Tom, show the crowd.  Show the crowd.  At least he shaved his pubes.  Let's see, man.  You didn't show me.  Show the girl.  Show the...  Baby, come on!  I'm telling you.  Nice balls.  Nice dick.  You'll like that.  Sandy, why don't you give him a handy?  Kids, I can show my stuff, too.  Hey, I can show my pussy that much, but I did.  A little bit.  Horrible.  Nice dick, though. 
[03:12:00]  Grab it, Sandy.  Sandy, why don't you grab it and yank it a little?  Average, everyday handyman thing.  Want me to touch it?  Give him a little handy.  How about money for that?  No, no, no.  You're going to give me some of your hundred?  No.  No money.  No money.  Why not money?  It's prostitution.  You're a dummy.  It's the Christmas season.  Okay.  You know, do you want me to lick it, suck it?  No, just touch it.  Finger fuck his asshole.  What?  All that.  Yeah.  All that. 
[03:12:30]  What, you like me to finger fuck your ass?  I like that.  If you got, we got to cut a fingernail off.  Did you wipe today, though?  I mean.  Oh, yes, he did.  Yes, I do.  I wipe every day.  It's almost like they're playing a $20,000 period again.  Before I finger fuck your ass, I want to wipe it.  I think we need more surgical gloves.  I think we might need more surgical gloves.  You want to.  I hope you don't have a hemorrhoid like me.  Sandy Cain.  Sandy.  You're all talk, no action, Sandy Cain. 
[03:13:00]  You didn't touch it.  Who's got a hemorrhoid?  I touch his hair.  It's a friendly tip.  All right, put a glove on.  Put a glove on and check his prostate.  All right, she's putting a glove on.  Keeping it safe.  Keeping it safe.  We're going to get, like, give him a handjob with a rubber glove.  Yeah, it's a, you know.  This is a first.  Should we grease up the glove for you?  Okay.  We have any gasoline?  Do you have any gasoline?  That KY jelly?  What is that?  Okay, you can spit on me.  This is fucking. 
[03:13:30]  That's what men do.  They spit.  They spit on me.  We got, like, an old fucking peep show performer jerking up on all of us.  Oh, my God.  What did you put on there?  Honey?  No, no.  Get rid of that glove.  No, not honey.  Oh, Jesus.  No, she's really going to do this.  Get another glove and get the KY.  Look at how you got Tippi all fucking upset.  I'm stuck to myself.  Really?  Yeah, no way.  I just like old-fashioned, you know.  Handjob.  All right, she's going to give you a...  Dad and maybe Vaseline, but I know honey. 
[03:14:00]  No, I know honey.  Are we getting some KY?  Hey, I have some KY jelly here.  So you're going to...  I have never done this in my life.  Something tells me you're lying.  Handjob in my life.  A blowjob, yes, but never a handjob.  So I just want to get you guys...  All right, we got the KY.  I've never...  Sandy, there you go.  No, never.  Sandy Cain, there you go.  Okay.  All right, get out of the way, Iraq.  All right, lube up the...  Holy shit.  How much money am I going to make from this?  None.  None.  It's prostitution.  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:14:30]  All right, show's over for a little bit.  Show's over.  What happened, Tom?  Tom, what happened?  I'm going to sit down for a minute here.  You need to talk.  We're going to hump.  And obviously, no humping, though.  Well, you could sit down, Tom.  Come on.  It's not something you've got to stand and do.  How do you open this?  Stupid Iraq.  Who's in the way?  Open it.  Do it.  Let's make it happen, man.  All right.  One...  You want Tom to sit down?  I have never done a handjob in my life.  I swear to God.  Is that for handjobs?  A blowjob, yes, but never a handjob.  Okay. 
[03:15:00]  This is for...  To give handjobs.  It's not going to hurt you, Tom.  It's just lube.  All right, look.  He goes handjob and he pulls his pants down.  Handjob.  So what do I do here?  You want Tom to sit down?  Okay.  Yeah, Tom, sit down on the couch.  Sit down.  Enjoy yourself, Tom.  Relax.  You're the star of the show.  Get yourself a beverage.  Sit back and enjoy.  Oh, my God.  Drop those trousers, sweetie.  He's hiding his penis.  Tom.  He's ashamed.  You're missing the point here.  He's ashamed.  He's being a shy boy.  All right.  Take it out. 
[03:15:30]  Go ahead.  I'm going to make it.  All right.  I got to stand up for this?  Yeah, for a second.  No, you got to sit down and stay there, but just, you know, take it out.  Let Sandy see it, and then she'll do what she does.  I have never given a handjob.  We heard you.  All right.  We know.  We don't believe it.  All right.  Go ahead.  Tom needs a handjob real bad.  All right.  Here you go.  Wow.  She's grabbing it, and she's tugging on it.  I'm getting a handjob.  I'm looking at George Bush.  Now, all right, all right, all right.  All right.  Don't say anything about the person.  Concentrate, Tom. 
[03:16:00]  Whatever turns you on, just think of something.  Okay.  Think of titties, asshole, maybe Britney Spears.  And he's playing with her breasts.  She's just giving her a little tug.  Nothing much harmless.  It's all right.  Touch your titty.  It's all right.  I mean, it's all in fun.  It's for Opie and Anthony.  I mean.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Opie and I'm doing this motherfucking thing.  Freedom of speech, man.  What did he say?  Freedom of handjobs.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  It's getting hard. 
[03:16:30]  It's getting there.  It's getting hard.  Get the cameras in here.  It's getting really hard.  I'm getting to the message.  I want to go to CBS News.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the best safe sex demonstration I've ever seen.  Yeah, I'm right.  This is like, oh, boy.  This is the thrill of my life.  Come on.  I want all those guys that see this on TV across the nation.  Yes.  All right.  See this.  So I'll get more jobs.  Yeah, all right.  More handjobs.  I need more handjobs.  Yeah, more blowjobs.  Even a long.  That's a few of those, too. 
[03:17:00]  So how are you feeling?  You feeling erected or what?  I feel relaxed.  I feel a little stupid.  Yeah, a little stupid.  Why don't you give his bag a tickle, Sandy?  God Almighty, be a trooper, would you?  What should I do?  Tickle his bag.  Oh, okay.  Just give it a tickle.  Okay, a little tickle, yeah.  We'll tickle his bag, for Christ's sake.  Where's your bag?  Be a person.  Well, you might direct me, man.  You're the director.  Tickle his bag a little.  I just have a much more direction.  Where's your bag, honey?  Just scroll down.  Tickle it.  Make the coochie coochie sound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Down here. 
[03:17:30]  That's good, the way you're petting it like it's a fucking, like it's a Siamese cat.  Love my balls, baby.  Yes.  I'm not going to really have a good night's sleep tonight.  Good.  You know, Jim, you're a great comedian, you're an author, and now you're a director, too.  I'm very impressed.  I like my balls rubbed.  I like my balls rubbed.  This is better than any porno I've ever seen.  I'm going to be at the hero balls room tonight on 16th Street. 
[03:18:00]  The ball room?  Yeah, the balls room.  They're having a chit-chat while something horrific is going on.  Team facelift.  Aim it away from us.  Oh, the team facelift?  The team facelift.  Hey, you're getting...  Yeah, they're aiming too close to us.  I think I'm getting real hard.  Yeah, he's getting hard.  What do I do?  Hey, Judy, you're next.  So don't go...  I gotta go.  What do I do?  Have a look at him.  You just keep tugging.  What do you do?  Who knows?  Keep going. 
[03:18:30]  What do you know?  Who knows?  Wait, Tom goes...  Tom goes, keep doing what you're doing.  How was that, Tom?  Feels good.  Now you can hear.  Okay.  This brought his hearing back, obviously.  You know what I'm saying?  I like the feeling.  Like Dave Brown.  He like to feel good, too.  It's getting hard.  Take a time.  Hey, Tom, would it help you if she tickled your butt a little bit?  Well, I'm a little older, so a little longer.  Uh-oh.  Is that it?  Look at her just jacking him.  It's horrendous. 
[03:19:00]  This is hysterical.  She could be fucking...  She could be milking a cow right now.  Yeah.  That unsexy.  And Tom's just itching his belly.  There is nothing...  You want to get married, maybe?  There is nothing sexy about this.  She's a trooper.  She's a trooper.  There's nothing personal or sexy about this whatsoever.  What's up?  What do you think I should do next?  Just...  You stand in here.  E-Rock, look down.  Is it sexy?  Yeah.  In that way there, we'll be all happy.  Okay.  Eh.  It's really not making it, folks. 
[03:19:30]  Uh-oh.  Well, Sandy, it's looking...  Oh, boom.  Well, Sandy, maybe you got to do something else to it.  What happened, Tom?  What happened?  I don't know what happened.  I got too many people looking at me.  Tom, would it help if she tickled your hiney a little bit?  George Bush showed up on screen.  Tickled your hiney.  Tom?  Why don't we turn the TV off before we have to spend another 30 days wondering what the F is going on with us?  Hey, Tom?  What the fuck?  Tom, would it help if she tickled your backside just a bit?  What, what?  Would it help if she tickled your backside? 
[03:20:00]  At the finger?  Yeah, a little fanny tickle.  Straighten you right out.  Yeah, well, yeah.  That might work.  Yeah?  All right.  Yeah, well, let me take a break here.  Take a break here.  Let me take a break here.  For a man being jerked off by an awful woman, he needs a lot of breaks.  I'm going to break right now.  He deserves a break.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  That glove.  No.  JT.  That needs to be put in a fucking hazardous waste bin.  Mom, what are you doing?  JT from Virginia.  What a great service you guys are doing for the less fortunate this holiday season. 
[03:20:30]  Hand jobs for the homeless.  What is all bubonic plague legs doing?  I feel a little cold from all that lubricant.  All right.  Tom's putting clothes back on.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Should we take a break and get into money, honey, next?  I think we should.  I have to tinkle and just reevaluate everything.  Yeah, that, um...  I got to go walk.  Fucking Anthony has a surgical mask on.  This is just a weird...  Yeah, it really is.  I have the surgical mask on again because...  I'm at work right now. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, we're at work.  We're at work.  Boy, you put it in that perspective and it's really silly.  If someone said, Jim, what are you doing right now?  I could say my job.  I'm at work.  Stop bothering me.  I'm at work.  I'm a nine-to-fiver.  You need to look at Tom.  Dude, Sandy Kane just whacked off Tippi Tom and just...  It was the most unsexiest thing ever.  Well...  Ever.  Well, he didn't...  He's a little unsexiest, man.  This is my right miss.  Hey, Tippi Tom, turn around.  There's something on his orange shirt. 
[03:21:30]  What does it say in the back?  He doesn't know.  What?  It says meat.  What does the front say?  Rotting?  She's like, he's infinite.  Hey, Chad from Jersey.  I think he's a little impotent.  Chad from Jersey writes, hey, Opie, what the hell happened to Lane Cool for a while?  And then last one picked writes, homeless sex in the studio. 
[03:22:00]  This is what a merger dying sounds like.  And then he goes, I have no idea why XM wants you to take a month off.  Told you.  That's harmless.  It was horrible.  He was very responsible.  No sex.  Oh, they're fun.  They're just...  They're just a couple of people having fun.  Right.  Was that fun?  Jackass George Bush talking.  You know, turn off the fucking TVs or change the channel.  It's kind of...  Thank you.  Before you said something.  Don't worry about George Bush. 
[03:22:30]  You don't like George Bush.  Even the homeless don't like him, huh?  All right.  Who's a political commentator?  All right.  We got to take a break.  Tippi Tom, how was that?  It was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was real good.  I mean, we're going to get better because we're just getting started.  Yeah.  Stay like that, Tommy.  With the address, relax.  You're with your friends.  Well, he's pretty much stressed.  For the people that are scared shitless in Washington, he is...  He's fine.  Yeah. 
[03:23:00]  I'm just getting to know her, you know?  All right.  We're going to take a break and we're going to do Money, Honey next?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Today, we're going to talk to a man who says to have a deadly weapon to defend yourself.  I am an armed citizen.  How about that?  Is this really paranoia?  I don't want to be robbed.  I don't want anyone in my goddamn house.  You're being attacked.  Your life is on the line.  What do you do?  Pile the bodies up at the door.  Do you have a knife?  Do you have all that stuff around?  What are you, crazy?  Why would I want to get into a knife fight with somebody? 
[03:23:30]  How else are you supposed to stop somebody?  Get in their tracks.  I will have the AK and the AR, one in each hand.  Being overtaken.  Rally point.  Rally point.  Anyone coming in the bedroom door is completely exposed to my fire.  Zips in the wire.  I will fight it out till the end, till somebody's dead.  Ooh, clever.  Yeah, we got some music to set up the money, honey bit.

Wonderful.  All right.  Well, we got two, four, five.  We got five women in studio and Sandy Cain.  And they're down in their bra and panties, and they look horrified.  What's wrong, ladies?  It smells really bad over here.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  That would be Tippi Tom.  Yeah, they're not happy about the smell in the studio.  Homeless gentleman.  Laysaw?  Laysaw?  No, no, no.  Just bad for the...  It'll fuck up your senses.

And we're getting red rums for Patty so she doesn't mean to script. 
[03:27:30]  No, okay.  You want to be naked?  Stalker Patty is showing, like, it's the new look the women like to do where it's, like,  underneath cleavage.  Oh, my God.  And usually that looks really hot on women, and I'm not getting that same feeling today.  Yeah.  That's a jog bra, actually.  Right, but you know how the women, like, let the bottom of their boobs show now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's kind of what Patty's doing and not getting much of a reaction.  I think it looks pretty sexy, Patty.  I like it on you.  I like it.  Jimmy kind of likes your body. 
[03:28:00]  Thank you.  I think you look good.  All right, Stalker Patty, what are you going to do with all the money that you roll around  and get today?  Pay some bills.  Of course.  Of course.  What bill?  All right, where did you stop?  All right, thanks, Patty.  What bill are you going to pay?  What do you have to pay?  What's backed up?  Well, my XM is due the 30th, and I have to pay $60 for my cable bill.  And then I want to go down to Atlantic City for a little visit.  I haven't been in a while.  I'm going to take the shit for me. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, we understand.  Are you still trying to get with that guy down there?  No.  Oh, remember that guy?  I see him occasionally, and I say hi, but I didn't really know him.  Well, that's the best kind, right?  Exactly.  Right, Patty?  Hey, hey.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Patty, describe the girl next to you.  Basically, the polar opposite of you.  Very lovely.  Well, she's also about 30 years younger than me, too.  Are you trying to say you look like that 30 years ago? 
[03:29:00]  In fact, I think I look very good from my age.  I'm noticing women my age stooped over.  You are stooped over, dummy.  Exactly.  Have you seen your own ass lately?  I've been walking with walkers and stuff like that.  Walkers?  I will never have that happen to me.  Walkers?  You're 51, 52 years old.  What are you talking about?  Pretty young, really.  That's young, yeah.  Sandy Cain's easily 70, and she's got a better body than you.  How old are you?  I was seven.  Are you over 52?  Me? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  She's 10 years older than me.  How do you know?  Because I heard that show.  We had her real age at N.E.W., and she got pissed off.  She's well with her 60s.  When you revealed her age.  How do you know?  How do you know?  They saw your ID card that day in the studio.  Okay.  I smell a fight.  Yes, before my own birthday.  No, it wasn't.  Bitch.  Oh.  I take it back.  Bitch.  I'm sorry.  So cut you with a razor blade. 
[03:30:00]  No.  And who's the woman next to you?  Madam, with the paint, very lovely.  Thank you.  I'm Trinity.  Hi, Trinity.  And you're from where?  Mawa, Jersey.  Okay, cool.  Who brought you?  My boyfriend's friends.  Your boyfriend's friends?  Because he couldn't come, so.  Why would he bring, why would he allow his friends to bring his girlfriend?  Well, I'm here to them, too.  And so we're all cool.  It's good.  Wait, so he's not here, and you're going to get naked for his friends, basically.  Yeah.  Why couldn't he come?  He's at work, and he's really busy.  Couldn't take the time off.  What does he do? 
[03:30:30]  He is a brand manager for a consulting company.  Hey, going back to Patty.  Patty, are you taking your top off for the contest?  I guess so.  All right, then take it off.  Let's go.  Everybody else does.  Let's go.  It's optional, obviously.  And then the other girl that we just talked to, you'll take your top off?  I'll do it now.  Thank you.  All right, Patty, take yours off.  All right.  Wow-wee.  Trinity's lovely.  Thank you.  Patty, your breasts are looking very sexy.  She's got great tits, I'm sorry. 
[03:31:00]  She's got great tits.  You're kidding, right, Jimmy?  No.  15 pounds is something to do.  All right, well, you're fucking selling yourself.  I could be worse.  We get it.  You're here for Loma.  Christ.  I could be worse.  All right, let's move on to the next contestant in the Money Honey contest.  Hi.  Hi.  What's your name?  Dan.  Sue?  And what's your deal, Sue?  Here for Christmas presents.  You needed a little extra money, right?  Where are you from?  Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  Where?  Oh, you're the West Springfield girl? 
[03:31:30]  Oh, I didn't hear you.  Where are you from?  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Sandy.  Where are you from?  West Springfield.  Okay.  In what state?  Mass.  Oh, Mass.  Okay, yeah.  Great.  All right, and we know Sandy Kane.  She's pretty much top.  Well, she is topless.  Double D's over here.  With no nipples.  Hey, I know.  No one's perfect.  I need someone to suck them out.  Never met the right man.  Oh, God.  All right, Red Rum, we know very well.  Faithful listener to the show and a true trooper. 
[03:32:00]  She's the best when it comes to this radio show.  And I think she's the odds-on favorite to get a lot of money stuck on her body.  Thank you.  I really do.  I think you're going to work hard, harder than these women.  They're going to get shy.  You're going to get right in there, I know.  Nice.  Huh?  A little music on?  No music yet.  What do you mean music for?  Yeah, to roll around.  Quiet.  Barney Fife legs.  You look like Armstrong's legs when he walked on the moon. 
[03:32:30]  Look at my bush.  Look at my bush.  Let's see it.  That's nice.  Okay, thank you.  A lot of people like a bush.  Want to take me home later?  Okay.  All right, finally, our last contestant.  We've got six girls.  Samantha.  Samantha.  Hi.  Where are you from, Samantha?  Philly.  Okay, and a tall girl.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'11".  Very nice.  Nice body, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, she's fantastic.  All right.  Thank you.  She's a lovely girl.  Half the money is on the floor. 
[03:33:00]  It's all in singles, and Pat Duffy's spreading it around.  Should we get the girls to start wiping honey all over their bodies?  Well, yeah, that seems to be what they have to do.  All right, ladies, step up to the table.  There's honey for everybody.  Anybody else want to be topless?  You might as well, because this way you get more money stuck to your extras.  And less stuff do you have to clean.  Look at Trinity's ass.  Wow.  Trinity, you have a nice hiney.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I was hoping you'd say that.  How could I not?  Lovely.  I was hoping you would say that.  Of course.  My biggest fear was that one of you would make fun of me for being ugly or something. 
[03:33:30]  Why?  You're a very beautiful girl.  Oh, thank you, but that was just my insecurity.  No, no, you're lovely.  We only speak the truth here.  Yeah.  We're not going to be fine.  Yeah.  Ew, look at how Patty puts honey on her body.  No.  Look at her.  It looks like you're fucking, like you're applying off because you're going on a mosquito.  Very sexy, Patty.  Anytime Patty's naked, why does Schindler's list just come to mind?  She looks like she should just be ready to be thrown in a cement room. 
[03:34:00]  I've had a bigger heart on watching fucking burn victims get salve put on them than watching  fucking Patty do that.  All right.  Is all the money down on the floor?  About half of it.  About half of it.  Wow.  Timmy, a lot of money, a lot of money.  We can keep putting it out.  Yeah, you could just, well, you could, the rest of it, you guys could just start throwing  in the air and stuff at them.  Yeah.  All at the same time, make a good video. 
[03:34:30]  Maybe it gets on YouTube.  You never know.  All right.  Girls, do whatever it takes to get the honey on you.  If you want to just pick it up with your hands, that's fine, too.  Yeah, we don't care.  We don't care.  Whatever works.  All right.  They're starting, they're rubbing it all over their bodies.  How does the honey feel?  Cold and sticky?  Are we going to need somebody to ripen on their asses and stuff so they can pick it up  on the back, too?  Like, can they get to their own bodies and their own backs?  Yeah, Jim is, uh...  No, no, I won't do it. 
[03:35:00]  Please.  No, no, no, no.  I thought that's what you were getting at.  I would love to.  Jimmy's offering his services if you need your asses.  Yes.  I'll put some honey on my nose.  Oh, look at Sandy.  I need my back done.  Oh, my God.  How do we leave here?  Quiet.  How do we leave here?  Hopefully in a body bed.  Exactly.  Hopefully with Quincy talking about you.  Hey, Sam.  I've never seen this before.  A living corpse. 
[03:35:30]  Is Patty naked?  No, she's got a little G-string on.  Oh, okay.  Oh, a sexy little number.  Trinity's smart.  She's fucking loading up on honey all over.  Yeah, she's, uh...  A couple of these fucking girls are half-assed,  isn't it, but not Trinity.  No.  Fucking...  Ladies, you can help each other out  and rub the honey on each other's backs.  Sandy's putting it all over those giant awful tits.  In her ass.  Big awful tits and small awful tits.  Okay.  Well, they're fucking point made.  She's got...  She's got massive feeders.  That's just...  More money for me, honey. 
[03:36:00]  All right.  All right.  Honey.  Yeah, but we get it.  Who's almost ready?  Exactly.  Sam, you gotta get some good video here.  And hand out the rest of the dollars  to, you know,  the guys to start throwing around.  Oh.  Tie him to a brick.  Who's almost ready?  I'm almost ready.  Oh, wow.  Look at that one.  Oof.  I just need my...  You know, a plus  is that all the honey is sucking up  while the tippy-tom smells,  so it's actually getting nice in here.  Yeah. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, these fucking girls  are fucking hot.  How are the girls gonna get their...  How are they gonna get the honey  on their backs?  She's helping.  All right.  Oh, very nice.  Aw, look at the girls  that are not being all competitive.  Team effort.  That's nice.  Aw.  That's sweet.  Sandy Kane's awful straw hair  is getting stuck on here already.  Anyone else notice that?  Look at this.  I can't wait.  It's just this guy.  Oh, God.  No.  Ah!  I feel like asking you  why we couldn't do  the homeless shopping spree.  Oh, boy.  This dope.  Thank you, fan. 
[03:37:00]  It's like cotton candy.  I didn't get it.  Turn around.  All right.  Oh, that wasn't...  That read a little.  Yeah.  I think it did.  Somebody should have coughed you.  I don't know.  Her hair kind of looks like  familiar.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  This is just fucking wonderful.  They call me nuts.  Hey, uh...  A little observation.  Sandy Kane  wanted to put her hair up 
[03:37:30]  in a...  in a...  in a thing.  A girl's thing.  And her hands got stuck  in her own hair.  In her hair.  That guy's cum  in my hands.  No.  Yeah.  Don't lie.  There was no cumming.  This is...  Is the money going to stick  to these broads?  I don't know.  That's a good question.  Hey, are we throwing  the Froot Loops  and all that other stuff down?  Sure.  Sure.  Right now, or...  Yeah, why are we doing?  Let's fucking get...  Do it after.  We can do it as it's...  Yeah, you guys should just...  You guys should throw the money,  throw the other stuff. 
[03:38:00]  You know, make it a nice show  for everybody.  All right.  Who's ready?  Wowee.  Ready.  I think they're all ready.  Everyone's ready?  All right.  Now we gotta tie your hands  behind your back.  Or do they just...  Or in front, whatever.  In case they lose their balance.  Yeah, in front.  In front.  Yeah.  All right.  They're duct taping.  Am I actually saying this  as we do our job today?  Yeah.  Yep.  Now the naked girls  will have their arms  and duct tapes. 
[03:38:30]  Naked girls and honey  with duct tape on them.  This is fucking great.  Right.  How great would it be  if we had bears  we could let run through here?  Yes.  I'd come through.  By the way, it's too bad  that Mike Cole had to beat  the traffic home.  I know.  We want to thank Mike  for stopping by  on his big 40th birthday.  Early, yeah.  He left at the wrong time,  I think.  He would have really loved  these naked women in studio.  Absolutely.  But he had to beat the traffic  back to his wife and kids.  Despite his homosexuality,  he would have enjoyed  what's happening here. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  So.  All right.  The girls are getting duct taped.  Pat Duffy, by the way.  Bang up job again.  I heard he laid down  the plastic pretty much  by himself today.  That was me.  Good job.  What a guy.  Good job there, Pat.  Butch of help too, though.  All right.  Have we hired you yet?  Not yet.  Yeah, not yet.  Maybe another year.  Oh, nine?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, it took Sam what?  Over a year?  It took all of us.  It took all of us.  It's amazing how no one's  in the studio helping do shit  and yet when the fucking  naked girls need to be  duct taped,  we have nine guys. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  Fucking lined up.  Okay.  Take my mask off.  No one's around.  That's good.  Now it smells like  homeless eating honey.  This is wonderful.  All right.  Release the bees!  Wait, are we coming?  Can you imagine?  All right, Sandy,  stop cheating.  Those fucking talons.  Hey, with you,  I can't help it, Tim.  She's already  grabbing at the money.  There's plenty for everybody.  There's plenty for money.  All right. 
[03:40:00]  Are we all duct taped?  We're all fuck taped here.  All right.  I get it.  I got it.  She's such an ass.  By the way,  let me get the plugs in again  there, Tham,  because BodogFantasy.net  or BodogLife.net, right?  BodogLife.net came to the table  big time.  They provided $2,500  that is all over the studio now  in singles,  so thank you to BodogLife.net.  When you want to learn  to play poker like a pro,  it's BodogLife.net. 
[03:40:30]  And then you got  one of those dollar bills  has a,  what,  something on it.  And if that's stuck  to your body,  ladies,  you're going to win  a five-night ski vacation  for two in Winter Park,  Colorado.  I almost said Winter Park,  Florida,  because that's where  my sister is from.  Includes air travel  on Frontier Airlines,  lodging,  lift passes,  a pair of Solomon skis  or snowboard,  and a Columbia titanium jacket  all courtesy of  SkiColoradoNow.com.  And what else we got?  And then we got  a six-month free subscription  to Gamefly.com. 
[03:41:00]  That's on one of the dollar bills.  To get video games  delivered direct to your door,  it's Gamefly.com.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  We need music.  Do we have a fan blowing stuff  or no?  We don't need a fan.  We don't need that, no?  No, these guys are going to  throw the rest of the money  at them as they're on the floor.  All right.  We're going to help you out  a little bit by throwing  money at you girls  and hoping it sticks  on your bodies, okay?  Sam, you got it?  All right.  Sam's in a good position  to videotape this whole thing.  We need a song.  What song would you ladies 
[03:41:30]  like to hear?  Let me suck your cock.  What a complete douche.  It's funny.  She's crazy.  It was Casey Kasem  when they're douche.  Keith's got some dollar bills  to throw at him.  Let me suck your cock.  Do I have my...  All right.  Let me suck your cock.  What about...  All right.  We need some kind of music  or should we just let him go?  No, music would be great, right?  All right, guys out there!  Missiles and markers.  Huh?  I love dick.  I love that one. 
[03:42:00]  No, no.  Guys out there,  you can, you know,  get into it  and cheer the ladies on, okay?  We can use some nice background noise.  We're trying to produce  something nice here.  All right.  Are you ready?  All right.  Let's get the show on the road.  All right.  And go!  There they go.  The money hunting contest has begun.  The girls are all over the studio  rolling around.  Oh, it is sticking.  The money is sticking.  Oh, it is sticking like a charm. 
[03:42:30]  The guys are throwing money at the girls.  They are covered.  My goodness.  This worked out better than I thought.  They're rolling around.  They're rolling on top of each other.  This one girl,  you can't even tell she's nude anymore.  She's completely covered in money.  Sandy Kane sucks at this game.  The guys are now firing  the cereal out of him.  The money is running away from Sandy.  Pat Duffy,  don't throw it like Buckshot.  They're firing cat food  and Fruity Pebbles at them.  And they're throwing more money 
[03:43:00]  onto the girls.  Yeah, Sandy Kane's the only pussy  that's hanging out of her fucking...  All right, Sandy,  I'm trying to help you out  with some money here.  Sandy has like...  She has like $10 on her.  The money is actually avoiding her.  Yeah.  These girls are completely...  The presidents are actually speaking.  No.  Stop.  These girls are completely covered.  They've got like money  like suits on at this point.  Sandy,  this is not yoga,  you idiot.  Roll around.  Roll around,  you old whore.  Let's go. 
[03:43:30]  Wow.  Oh my God.  Look at this.  I am amazed  that this actually works.  It really did work.  This one girl,  you can't even...  I'm trying to get money  on stupid Sandy's  big tisky  knocking it off.  All right,  keep rolling, ladies.  Red Rum is very smart.  Of course she is.  Yeah,  she's just rolling  back and forth,  back and forth,  back and forth.  Yeah.  This...  Well, I think...  All right, 
[03:44:00]  yeah,  all right,  we're throwing  the rest of the money.  Oh, boy.  They're just dumping  crap on Sandy Kane.  Absolutely amazing.  We're surprised  this actually worked.  They're throwing stuff  at Sandy Kane's head.  She still has...  She still has way less  than the rest of the ladies.  Look at Tom.  I'm surprised Tom's  on the floor with this.  All right.  Tippy Tom is checking  the whole thing out.  The girls are stuck together. 
[03:44:30]  The girls are now  getting stuck together.  They're rolling over each other.  They're rolling around.  They're almost done here,  I'm thinking.  What's that, Steve?  That's mayo.  We got mayo  to throw into the equation?  Wait,  will that make the money  fall off?  Yeah,  it might...  Oh, yeah,  don't do that.  Don't do that,  because it's working  perfect so far.  Pat Duffy and others,  if you want to pick up  the money off the floor  and help the ladies out,  throw it on their bodies,  that would be great.  I don't think they can  get more money on now.  It looks like it's... 
[03:45:00]  They've kind of  leveled off.  They're saturated.  Well, the trick is now  to get some honey  on the money  and then roll around  and get money  on the money.  Right, right.  Well, you may have to do...  You may have to hide  the money somewhere.  Wow.  All right,  they're attempting to try to...  They're all rolling around  naked with fucking money.  It's really kind of sexy.  Sandy Kane is picking up  wads of dollars  with those huge feeders  of hers.  Sandy just doesn't know  what she's doing.  This is not a performance  art piece.  This is a fucking zilch. 
[03:45:30]  Get in there,  you whore.  A zilch.  She really is a zilch.  Fucking...  All right.  They're manually trying  to just stick money  on themselves now.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is...  And what a studio audience  we have in here today.  Amazing.  Guys, what do you think  out there?  Yeah, they're loving this.  They're digging it.  They're digging it.  They're completely nude.  Well, you can't even tell  they're nude anymore.  Look at dollar bills  all over their bodies.  Big A's got his hatchet  already.  Oh, yeah.  He's all fired up,  ready to cut one of these  lovely girls in two. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  All right, should we...  Chicks and money.  Tippi, Tippi, Tom,  what do you think of this?  He can't believe it.  All right.  This is marvelous.  Are we going to stop  the girls at this point?  I want to do myself.  I bet he does.  Some of them are starting  to use their hands.  They're making sure  they're not cheating.  Yeah.  You know what we could do?  We could...  All right.  Should we stop them right now  and have them start counting?  They pretty much have stopped  moving around.  Okay.  All right, ladies all,  stand up for a photo op 
[03:46:30]  with E-Rock and Sam.  Let's hear for the  Money Honey girls.  Wow.  Wow, that one girl  easily won.  It's stuck in her hair  and everything.  I'm going to go with  West Springfield.  The Massachusetts girl  I think is going to win  this thing.  Well, she's 6'11".  Shit.  All right.  Everyone look at E-Rock.  E-Rock, get a nice  little photo of everybody.  Very nice.  Okay. 
[03:47:00]  Wow.  All right.  Let's get a little view.  Yeah.  Now, uh...  We line up this way  so we can...  Yeah, line them up  and what are we going to do?  Have them start counting?  Yeah, we're going to have  to free their hands.  All right, yeah.  Free their hands.  I see a lot of hanging chads.  Yeah.  Hey, guys,  as they're standing there,  why don't we just throw  some of the money on them?  Yeah.  Help them out a little bit.  Yeah, get some more money  on these girls.  Just throw it.  Wow, this one girl  has probably,  safe to say,  $20 to $25 
[03:47:30]  stuck to one foot alone.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah, keep your feet  pressed in it.  Don't lift it up.  Yeah, guys, Pat Duffy, uh...  They're now using their feet.  You all look like silly geese.  Wow.  They are just all, uh...  covered.  Covered, yeah.  Now, what do we do here?  Do we have to count the money?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  All right.  Free their hands  so they can start counting  what they got.  Their keep. 
[03:48:00]  Hey, Pat,  can you get some scissors, please?  How does it feel?  Scissors.  And how do we know  where the dollars are?  What if no one  picked them up?  Well, that's a good question.  Mm-hmm.  How about, uh...  All right, let's, uh,  let's count the money.  All right, undo their hands.  Anyone have a knife on them?  Yeah.  Just...  Yeah.  Thrust it in.  I know you do.  Use Tom's feet  to cut them off.  Who's not supposed to be here?  Sticking some onto my titties.  All right, you do that, son.  All right.  We get it. 
[03:48:30]  For the 15 grand titties.  Yeah, big titties.  Judah Freelander,  what do you think?  This is interesting, dude.  I think, uh,  the girl from Massachusetts  is going to be the winner here.  By far, I think she is.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  She had a good technique.  What do you ladies think?  Any observations?  Anything you want to say?  It was awesome.  You had fun?  Do you feel sticky now?  I think what's her name?  Do you feel sticky?  I think the stalker  should go pay her bills  just like that.  She should walk into  the cable company  just like that  to pay her bills.  Where are they going to use this money? 
[03:49:00]  This sticky money?  You're going to have to wash it.  You're going to have to  somehow clean it.  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  Sandy has fucking  cocoa pebbles  in her pubes.  It's the fucking worst  thing I've ever seen.  No, but Norton,  those are already there.  That's not from here.  Those are already there.  That's some disease  they're trying to figure out  what it is.  All right.  Why don't we start,  do we have something  they can put their money in?  Because now they're panicking  like it's going to fall  on the ground.  You got plastic bags  or something?  We'll get you something.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  Look, it wasn't about 
[03:49:30]  following the rules  of accuracy.  Trust me.  I think what's her name?  I think Massachusetts  is just visually  here the winner.  Yeah.  We can't do that.  We got to count it, though.  You don't want to move.  You don't want to move  and lose any.  Yeah, they should have  plastic bags  so they can all just  throw your money  in the plastic bags.  Those are teeny bags.  They are little teeny bags.  Oh, jeez.  This could take years 
[03:50:00]  and cost thousands  of innocent lives.  All right.  They're handing out the bags.  These plastic bags  are not going to work.  No, they're not enough.  The money's right too sticky.  It's not going in the bag.  And her money's falling.  Red rum is not happy.  Oh, she just lost $10  to try to put it in the bag.  I think you always  pick it up.  We're fine.  We got what we wanted  from this thing.  Oh, exactly.  That was executed perfectly.  All right.  They're fine.  Yeah.  Just keep it, you know,  as together as you can, 
[03:50:30]  there, ladies.  Yeah.  Because you don't  want to lose any.  There's a bag for you.  Another one.  Smells good in here, though.  It smells better.  It definitely made it nice.  Honey and fruity cereal.  Honey, Froot Loops,  and pussy.  Yeah.  Someone said put the money  in the bag.  They all started shoving it  in Sandy.  Oh, look at those tits.  I thought you said in the bag,  not on the bag.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  You're seeing what I'm seeing,  Jimmy?  Yes.  Yes.  Just peeling those dollars off.  Peeling dollars off 
[03:51:00]  her big feeders.  Big-ass titties.  They're feeders.  Big-ass titties.  Big-ass white titties.  All right.  Later, gentlemen.  Later, guys.  We guys have to go.  A long time ago.  All right.  Officers.  Ah.  There you go.  And remember, if you don't win,  it's the effort that counts.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Ugh.  Patty's peeling dollars off her legs.  Right.  Right.  Right.  I'm going to go pay my bills.  Just a bunch of Froot Loops and honey  on her money as she sends it in. 
[03:51:30]  How are you going to go home and clean it?  How are you going to clean it, Patty?  Oh, just take a damp sponge.  Yeah.  A damp sponge.  A damp sponge.  Listen to that.  A damp sponge.  Not a wet sponge.  It's a moist, damp sponge.  A damp sponge.  Why don't you just rub dry cotton over it?  That won't be fucking dope.  Speaking of dry cotton, look what E-Roc's got.  Holy shit.  It's a fucking tribble.  Don't we have to meet with that?  Oh, God damn. 
[03:52:00]  I want someone to shit in her wig.  I'll give $20 for someone to shit in her wig.  Somebody's shit in her wig right now.  Tom is still here.  All right.  Yeah, this is a good question.  How are the ladies going to clean this money?  Can we get someone to shit in her wig?  They will need a honey solvent.  I think we kind of pushed it already.  I suggest kerosene and a match.  I'm snorting now.  There we go.  Ooh, naked.  That's cool.  DHL boxes.  Hey, they're starting to look naked again. 
[03:52:30]  They're starting to look naked again.  Oh, God, Patty.  Red drum is very smart.  They've got fruity pebbles all over them.  You know what?  By the way, for the people listening at home, half the money is still on the ground.  More than half.  More than half, yeah.  We're going to have to divvy it up.  How much was there total?  $2,500.  Wow.  It's still like $10 in the box.  God, that's a lot of dollar bills.  Yeah, of course.  And girls, don't let that cereal go to waste.  Like, why did we put any hundreds in here?  We should have put a couple of hundreds in fifties, right? 
[03:53:00]  I didn't.  I think it's good being singles.  I like the singles.  No, but a couple just to mix it up.  Just to make them fight for a couple.  Oh, that's an exciting idea.  No, that's a good idea.  Not just $2,500.  Fucking one girl with a big twat would just squat over it.  We'll vacuum it up.  Oh, there you go, Patty.  I like the way she thinks.  She's grabbing some of their hammer toes.  Steve, what are you giving them to wipe off with?  My tongue.  You know, all the girls' skin kind of looks like Tom's feet now. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  Painter's rags.  Tom's sat there very quietly, tippy-tom, watching this whole thing.  She's trying to figure out how to get this money.  Yeah, he's...  Which girl do I have to crack over the hill with a cobblestone?  The things he wants the most, money and food.  It's all up here.  In Massachusetts, you've got at least $100 on your back.  You're right.  And up your ass crack.  That's a nice technique.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's...  She's pulling money out of her ass crack. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, that was a smart move on her part.  That's what happens.  Whenever...  I think she's done this before.  Yeah, she's...  Whenever Mommy told you, don't put money in your mouth, you don't know where it's been,  she meant this.  Right here.  Sandy Kane's tits.  Let's get...  I know.  An asshole.  Three of the dollars are holding their nose.  Let's get some words from Tippy Tom.  Tom, what'd you think over there?  It's fabulous.  That's all I can say.  It's amazing. 
[03:54:30]  I never saw it before.  Fabulous.  I think he liked this better than the handjob.  I was enjoying the show.  How's that?  You got a lot of money.  It's amazing.  I never saw something like this before.  We're glad we can help you out there, Golden Buns.  All for you, Golden Buns.  Golden Buns.  Happy Holidays.  It's Golden Buns.  I just wish I could have joined in.  And maybe next year, or when you do this again, I can join in.  By the way.  God, imagine him in there rolling around.  How the hell are these girls going to get this crap off of them? 
[03:55:00]  Off of them.  We're handing them fucking...  We're handing them Kleenex.  They look like a data sponge.  That's all you need.  They look like glazed donuts.  I don't think honey is water-soluble unless the water's boiling.  We need boiling water.  Oh, my God.  Stop barking.  You're not producing anything.  Yeah, what are you barking out orders?  No, I got baby wipes in a bag that's next to the monitor.  What an old lady.  It's in a pink bag over there on the right.  I got baby wipes.  Right behind the couch there.  Along with some condiments I took from the diner. 
[03:55:30]  And crackers.  I like Erster crackers with my soup.  She's still got probably 50 bucks on her from Massachusetts.  Yeah, Massachusetts has a lot of cash on her.  If you pulled it all off, start counting, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  There's still a ton of dollar bills stuck to Santa Cain's.  That is, I know, I'm disgusted.  And someone has to help that girl out.  She's got a ton of money on her back still. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  It's very good.  She's got two dollar bills that look like little puppy ears in her hair.  Yeah.  It's a good time to be in a relationship.  You can't just go over there and scoop money off those big tits.  Start peeling them off.  Gotta stand here like a fruit and watch.  Are they actually using tissues to try to wipe that off with?  Jimmy, what do you want to do to your girlfriend when you get home?  I want to twist her neck like Malkovich did in the line of fire when the dog came to bark.  I just want to give her a quick neck twist and she'll collapse dead on the floor. 
[03:56:30]  I like asking Jimmy that every once in a while because for the most part, he's in love.  He's in love.  But every once in a while, there's something that happens in the studio that makes him want  to do horrific things to her.  Just a quick, like I'll say something about I'm sorry to hear you from Minnesota and I'll  just twist her neck and she'll collapse on the floor.  Thanks, Stan.  Appreciate that.  That was good on my part.  All right.  Please rip her hair out as you rip the dollar bills.  I know.  All right.  Ugh, the stickiness of the honey. 
[03:57:00]  They're attempting to count it.  It's disgusting.  There's no counting that.  It's all stuck together in clumps.  Is it easy to count?  Timmy Tom has fallen asleep.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm tied.  Keep track.  Yeah.  Oh, Sandy Kane bending over is not a sight you want to...  No.  It's not a Sandy.  I don't have a nice ass.  You don't have a nice ass.  You used to be in the rule book.  That should be on.  I have a gorgeous ass.  Even if I have a hemorrhoid.  Is it out?  Let me see.  Take it.  Show it.  Jimmy.  Do you think that's a nice ass?  Where's our camera crew? 
[03:57:30]  It's either a cherry fruit loop or you better see a doctor.  Or a hemorrhoid.  Camera crew.  Is my hemorrhoid out?  Yes.  Jimmy, camera crew.  They canceled your appearance an hour ago.  Yeah, they're all sneaking out the door.  Sneaking out.  They didn't even say goodbye.  They came here to film you for a new TV show and they're gone, man.  Yeah, I think they understand.  This is not going to be a good scene.  Yeah, this ain't going to make the cut for television.  It's The Edge with Jake Sassaville.  Or Sassaville?  Sassaville.  Jake, yeah.  Jake Sassaville.  It debuts on ABC February 14th. 
[03:58:00]  We'll plug it as time gets closer, obviously.  Absolutely.  All right.  Now what?  I have nothing more to say.  All right.  So what are we doing?  We're cleaning up now?  Yeah, they're going to clean up.  Yeah, it's clean up time.  It's line of the day time.  Hey, you know what I think we should do right now?  What?  Rape?  Ladies.  Ladies, listen up.  Yeah.  Everyone listening?  Yeah.  The rest of the money on the floor is up for grabs right now. 
[03:58:30]  Any way you want to get it.  Any way you want to get it.  Any way you want to get it.  Any way you want to get it.  Any way you want to get it.  Scoop that money up, you whores.  Wow.  Jesus, Opie.  We both did it together.  Massachusetts is still getting a lot of the cash.  Oh, Trinity's ass is fantastic.  Oh, they're sticking in their panties.  Danny, watch out.  Trinity has a very good money grabbing technique.  Yeah, shove it into your vagina. 
[03:59:00]  That's good.  God gave you holes for a reason.  They're little banks.  Little banks.  Leave a fire from me.  I need lunch money.  Oh, Fez.  Get out of here.  This is not a place for you.  Fez.  Don't sting it up your butt, Fez.  What is Fez Watley doing here?  Stealing the show and looking sexy.  Hey, Fez.  Thank you.  What do you think of these really hot women rolling around on the floor?  They're covered in honey.  How sexy is this?  Can we get bigger bills to cover them, please? 
[03:59:30]  You don't like it?  I wish they were rolling around in giant checks.  Cover up.  By the way, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Yes.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Why didn't you plug that first?  See, that's what you have to do, though.  Ron is going to kill you today.  What vivacious girls.  Why are we the ones promoting your show?  Why does it smell like cereal and homeless people in here?  That's what girls smell like.  Really?  What's the attraction?  Fez, you're looking the wrong way.  Look over there.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[04:00:00]  Yay, I won the ski trip.  All right.  Trinity won the ski trip for five nights in Colorado.  SkiColoradoNow.com, I believe.  Yeah, I'd say, who would you say?  Trinity is probably the hottest one there.  Yeah, I'd say Trinity, but I like red rum.  I'm a red rum fan.  I love red rum.  Yeah, she's called Trinity because she has three tits, right?  Is that it?  No, no.  Oh, Fez, you keep looking at us.  Look at the hot women.  They're covered in honey. 
[04:00:30]  They're picking up dollar bills.  Cereal.  What a nightmare this is if you're queer and diabetic.  Oh, my God.  You stay out of my medical record.  This is bad for your diabetes.  I got to call Liberty.  Have them sent over a double dose.  Patty's ass looks good right now.  It looks fucking juicy.  Are you kidding me?  She was bent completely over her. 
[04:01:00]  You talking about Duffy?  No, Patty's head was touching the floor.  That was the only way that would make that ass look good.  I have to imagine Morley Safer's ass would look the exact same way.  Fezzy, what do you think, huh?  Wow.  Just a bunch of men sharing a fine scene, huh?  Is that Sandy Kane's wart or a really big piece of Cap'n Crunch?  It's a Froot Loop, I think.  We got all the money up? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah, now they're peeling it off of the tarp because the honey has really got it stuck there.  He's really peeling it.  All right, now, Norton, how much are you going to give them if they get out some milk and eat all that leftover cereal?  That's Tippi Tom's job.  Yeah, yeah.  You're making my breakfast.  It's like a snack pack.  Froot Loops never go bad.  Oh, Sandy Kane's fucking legs.  They're just horrendous.  Isn't it just awful?  It looks like she's wearing baggy pants.  In this fucking awful jeans. 
[04:02:00]  It's high winds with baggy pants.  Oh, look at that in the back.  This should be one of those giant embalmers needles sticking in it.  You shouldn't have denim skin.  No.  Oh, her wig is stuck to her.  Uh-oh, what happened?  Her wig's stuck to her.  The wig's stuck to her ass.  Oh, my God.  She's being attacked by Leif Garrett in 1970.  Oh, no.  Peter Frampton's on her ass.  I'm working tonight at the... 
[04:02:30]  This is sure.  I'm in your balls room, man.  It's 12 midnight with Team Facelift, and I have to wear this fucking hand tonight.  Have that mole looked into.  My hole looks like two.  Sarah Foster is trying to eat Sandy.  Oh, great.  I can't get up now.  That's nice.  All right.  Pull your...  It looks like she's shitting out Sally Struthers.  She looks like she has a conjoined wave to her ass. 
[04:03:00]  What a wreck.  Oh, my God.  She's just stuck right to her ass.  She's just rotting away with the wig she usually wears stuck to her ass.  It's like one of those wacky wall walkers.  Oh, is that hysterical, man?  And there goes the rim job from Dolly Parton.  All right.  Oh, that is funny.  Hey, Patty.  Patty, is the honey coming off?  Yeah.  I need a shower when I get home.  No shit, Sherlock.  Jesus, Patty.  We know.  No, probably not. 
[04:03:30]  Just a couple more baby wipes, and you're good.  Yeah.  Be fine.  I do have a lot of baby wipes.  All right, ladies.  Of course you do.  Ladies, it's now time for the make-out part of the bit.  So, uh...  The bit.  That's right.  Pair up with your favorite woman and start making out.  That's right.  And somebody treat Tom's balls like a pan flute.  I don't know how they're going to clean this money fest, you know.  Yeah, it's...  They've done all this, and now basically... 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, they can use the money.  Money's worthless.  That's worthless money.  Unless you go to a honey bank.  I don't know.  Tom has fallen asleep.  Patty's going to fucking dab at it with, what, a sponge?  Hey, by the way, did anyone find the Gamefly dollar bill?  Let's get that plug in real fast, then.  Gamefly, what are they doing for us?  Six-month free subscription to Gamefly.com to get video games delivered direct to your door.  It's Gamefly.com.  And, of course, the $2,500 provided by BodogLife.net!  Yeah! 
[04:04:30]  When you want to learn to play poker like a pro, it's BodogLife.net.  Can I plug one thing?  Yes.  In Cleveland in February, the Hard Rock Cafe, I'm doing one show.  It is sold out.  There's like eight seats left, so we're putting a second show on sale tomorrow afternoon in Cleveland.  That's an awesome venue, too, dude.  The Hard Rock in Cleveland?  No, it's awesome.  Cool, I haven't met that yet.  It's so cool there, dude.  Jesus, Jimmy, you're fucking rocking.  I'll be at Caroline's Comedy Club tonight through Sunday.  Tonight through Sunday, the great Judo Freedlander.  Judo Freedlander, Caroline.  He kills on 30 Rock. 
[04:05:00]  His commie's great.  Yeah, make sure you check him out.  Judo's a fucking veteran, man.  He's been around for years.  How long have you been doing comedy now, Norman?  17.  Almost 18.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we're just about done.  Oh, line of the day?  Oh, we're going to do line of the day.  All right.  Girls, how do you feel?  Disgusting!  Like Donald Trump.  What is this?  Donald Trump.  You had his hair stuck to your ass earlier.  Yeah, and she did have his hair stuck to her ass.  Very good, guys.  I heard you. 
[04:05:30]  Can I put something?  Thank you.  Hold on, Trinity, what do you want to plug?  I want to plug my friend's band and my boyfriend's band because they brought me.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Not you.  What's your boyfriend's band?  It's Missiles and Markers.  You can see them on myspace.com backslash Missiles and Markers.  Missiles and Markers?  Yes.  What kind of music do they play?  They're like, I don't know.  Pop Rock.  All right.  Pop Rock?  Yeah.  It's like poppy rock, like Fall Out Boy-ish.  You kind of like safety dance type stuff?  I wish.  Men without hats in Florida?  No.  What do they sound like? 
[04:06:00]  I know they want their own thing, but...  Move your fat head, Steve.  If I had to compare them to a band, I'd say Fall Out Boy.  You know Fall Out Boy?  I don't know who that is.  There's a CD.  Okay.  Blocking.  That's fun to get there.  What's their song?  Which song?  It's to be Katie.  This is what we do today.  Give me that.  Thank you.  Oh, wait, you rock.  Open that up.  We'll play...  What's the band again?  Missiles and Markers.  Missiles and Markers.  Check them out on MySpace if you like them.  Yes.  Thank you.  Because Trinity's hiney is what got this done, by the way.  Just so the band knows.  That ass... 
[04:06:30]  I would have played a Hitler speech if she wanted to.  She would have done that anyway.  All right.  Are we in line today?  What are we doing?  Sure.  The girls are wiping off, trying to get their bodies back together.  Oh, now people...  I keep trying to show people Trinity, and it's the back of Kenny's big fat head.  Kenny.  Wait.  You usually are home by now.  Jimmy made a mistake.  What happened?  And he had to come all the way back?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the house of blues, not the hard rock.  Oh, shit.  A common error. 
[04:07:00]  A common error.  Jimmy.  Hey, Danny, anything to add?  That's the same place I'm thinking of.  Danny, everybody.  It's right on 3rd Street in downtown Cleveland.  Danny.  Yes?  Well, you were right there at Ground Zero.  Yeah, it was a very exciting matchup this morning.  Nice commentary.  All right.  What do we say?  There's a bunch of naked chicks running around in the street.  We should have released red ants. 
[04:07:30]  Although I'm not quite sure if Massachusetts Girl is the winner.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, Trinity has a nice giant pile.  You're up to 100 so far?  Which pile are you counting?  I got two boxes.  Trinity's got a fucking boatload of cash.  She's got a lot.  Wow.  She's probably got $350.  Who's counting?  Everyone else gave up on the counting for now?  Yeah.  Okay.  How would he give me that for head?  Can we get the totals for tomorrow's show?  Yes.  And let us know who got what?  Yeah, we have all their time.  All right. 
[04:08:00]  Line of the Day is brought to you by BodogFantasy.net.  Play BodogFantasy's NFL playoff pick'em game for free and win a trip to Vegas courtesy of BodogFantasy.net.  Let's get into the runner-up lines of the day.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  I'll throw it for once.  Arving?  Oh, thank you.  I'm honored.  Oh, and there goes the crowd.  Bye, everyone.  There they go. 
[04:08:30]  Bye, everybody.  Thanks for coming.  There's a good thing of the crowd departs.  They're shuffling out.  There they go.  There's hugs going on.  You know what I like about doing the show?  Not having to clean up after the show.  Yes.  I love that part because this looks like a fucking nightmare.  The old days we used to have to clean up our shit.  Oh, I know.  It makes me feel better about my apartment.  Yeah.  Yeah, huh?  I'm a fucking slob, but this is...  This is really bad.  And there's a homeless guy on the couch.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Judy, you gotta find it.  That guy jerked off by a...  That guy jerked off by a former burlesque fucking whatever. 
[04:09:00]  A vaudevillian.  Tom won't remember this.  He'll just have to...  I dreamt that a monster was jerking me off!  A monster!  I don't know what happened!  The thing from Bugs Bunny when he was fixing his hand?  Yeah.  That thing from the cartoon.  Let's give him a hand job!  Hey, Will!  We good?  Yeah, totally.  Everyone happy with their plugs and...  Are we square?  I said are we square! 
[04:09:30]  Square!  All right.  Fargo.  Yeah, another Fargo line.  He shot me in the fucking face!  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  That's a flesh wall right in the mouth.  Oh, my God.  A flesh wall.  That's what he keeps running into.  Oh, yeah.  Kung.  Kung.  Kung. 
[04:10:00]  He's like, just get on with it.  Say it.  I'm tired of waiting.  Can I just bring up an observation?  Whatever you need.  Roland.  Has a nice answer.  Seemed totally disinterested.  Where's Roland?  Exactly.  Where's Roland?  And I just saw him walk by and not even a casual glance into a room of naked women.  And even Spezzy's interested.  What's wrong with you, Roland?  I just saw you walk behind the bleachers and turn not even a casual glance to your left 
[04:10:30]  to look in the window at the girls.  I've been seeing them for the past two hours.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Where were you?  Right there.  I didn't see you.  And more importantly, why are you wearing Hal Holbrook's jacket from the fog?  I don't know.  Hal Holbrook.  I don't know.  This is why they don't wear jackets.  I'm calling him Ronnie now.  That'll cost me.  Roland.  Yes.  Which girl do you find sexy?  The one in the pink and white panties or whatever. 
[04:11:00]  That's Tom.  That's the big Tom.  No, Paul.  Patty, why are you putting on stockings?  That's Trinity.  It's warmer that way.  Of course.  Those aren't stockings.  Stickings.  It makes me cold.  Ah.  Yeah.  That's sticky.  All right.  We heard you.  We get it.  You're warmer.  Next time we'll use hot cereals.  Oatmeal.  Farina.  Farina.  I'm going to have some of that when I get home.  Oh, good.  And a warm bath. 
[04:11:30]  Well, I'm living Lodge tonight.  I'm having Farina.  Oh, wait till New Year's, party animal.  Yeah.  All right.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Um, that's all, uh, that's all, uh, that's all, uh, the news.  Folks.  That's all the news.  That's a stuttering pig.  That's a stuttering pig.  Jesus Christ.  That got hurtful. 
[04:12:00]  Yeah, it did.  I'm sorry.  Girl, she can help each other out there.  I feel bad about that.  Yeah, I did for a second.  No, that it's only runner-up.  Oh, really?  Really good.  Thank you, Fezzy.  You guys could, uh, help each other out.  All right.  Yeah, you girls help each other out.  That's right.  Yeah, you wipe that ass.  Yeah.  You wipe that cereal out of your butt crack.  Fezzy, look how unsexy the scene is right next to you to the right. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, God.  Ah, what's the matter?  I'm putting on my hose.  You know, the hot chicks have kind of gotten together on this.  They're all in one group.  Yeah.  The world's all just rockin'.  I just found my own little nook, and that was the hell.  Patty, face it, you're an outcast.  Look at her putting stuff.  You look like Sandy Kane putting her legs on.  Nothing.  Stickiness makes it hard to pull them up.  Shut up already.  Just shut up.  Stop being so technical.  Look, Tippi Tom's worried something got on his jacket. 
[04:13:00]  He's worried something got on his jacket.  I gotta go to the dry cleaner.  He's worried something came off it.  Tippi, how you doing?  Tippi Tom's sitting over here enjoying the show.  You know, I guess it's closing time.  Fezzy, we had...  Closing time.  We had Sandy Kane jerking off the plate.  Yep.  With a surgical glove.  I don't know who I feel more sorry for.  I know, it was really bad.  And they're just having a conversation.  All right, here's the last runner-up line of the day. 
[04:13:30]  Just lift up that leg.  Which leg do you want me to lift up?  The right one, whatever.  I got two legs.  Well, for now.  We'll check with you later.  You got it.  Thank you, sir.  Let's laugh at other people's afflictions.  Very well.  I'm a one-trick pony.  What can I tell you?  All right, they're helping each other out.  And Ron and Fez, noon to three.  I want to thank Pat Duffy and the gang.  They really did a bang-up job getting this thing together today.  We're going to have to do a bang-up job getting it out of here before Ron and Fez. 
[04:14:00]  Please.  No shit.  Look at the girls helping each other.  That's something you don't see with the guys on our contests.  You never see a guy helping wipe another guy's ass.  What is that?  Or, you know, when we did the bee sting on the balls, you never saw another guy holding  some, or putting some salve on another guy's ball sack.  Or trying to suck out the poison.  Yeah.  You just don't see that kind of camaraderie in men that you're doing the women folk here.  You just set me up for that old gag.  That old gag.  Hey, Stugger Patty, why are your pants up so high? 
[04:14:30]  They are up high, BT.  This cleaning is definitely the hottest part of the show.  Yeah, the cleaning's good.  It's very nice.  They're like cats, almost.  Yeah.  The way they're grooming themselves.  It's very cat-like.  You're right.  Their legs, they're kind of, you know, standing on their toe and then wiping down.  It's kind of sexy.  They actually might be affording their bodies in weird ways.  Are you still sticking?  And then the old mangy alley cat, Sandy Kane's got to come in and ruin the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  Can I ask Jimmy something? 
[04:15:00]  Can I ask Jimmy something, please, before the line of the day?  Yeah.  Jimmy, how bad do you want to go over there and help the ladies out?  Shut up, Sandy.  I want to fuck, I want to help Red Rum.  I want to...  Oh, shut up.  Who told you to shut up, Sandy?  Shut up.  Who told you to shut up?  He keeps saying shut up.  Wait, what's that about?  Iraq?  Iraq?  Hold on, hold on, ladies.  We have a problem.  This is one of our guests.  Iraq, what are you saying?  What's the problem?  Iraq.  Shut up.  Yeah, but she's a guest on the show. 
[04:15:30]  It's a talk show.  She's supposed to talk.  Iraq, man, you know?  For you.  Yeah, but you kept saying shut up.  Yeah, shut up.  I know, but I was jerking him off.  That was fun, you know?  I mean, I was talking.  Iraq, are you annoyed by Sandy King?  You've had it?  I'm totally a stranger I'm jerking off.  I want to rub her face against the metal grate.  You know who she sounds like?  She sounds like Tony Manero's dancing partner.  He helped me, man.  He helped me, okay?  Karen Lynn Gorney or something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, her. 
[04:16:00]  That's who she sounds like.  Yeah.  You know, I'm going to buy some Hanukkah gifts and stuff.  But Sandy, you're a guest.  Why is he telling you to shut up?  Well, you ask him, man.  I didn't say that sometime again.  Oh, I think Iraq will have a good answer.  Iraq, why are you telling her to shut up as she's giving you that look?  No one likes you.  Oh, wow.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Because you're...  Why?  Why don't you tell...  Iraq, why don't you tell everyone why Sandy Kane is here?  That's a very good question.  Why am I here?  Why is Sandy Kane here?  Because you're the goof factor in all this hotness that was going on. 
[04:16:30]  Oh, okay.  So is that why I should shut up?  Yes.  Why?  Because no one likes you.  No one wants to hear you.  They don't?  How come I'm talking now?  Because you don't shut up.  I have to watch the TV show on for 13 minutes.  No one watches your fucking show.  I do know.  I do.  Wow.  I'm on public access.  I'm also on MySpace, too.  And I just made a movie.  You know what?  And I'm on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It's my 50th show.  I was on before you, asshole.  That's...  Wow.  Face. 
[04:17:00]  You better give her her own mic.  Give her her own mic.  Give it to her.  You're like, oh, shit.  You're pussy whipped, man.  You're pussy whipped.  Why is he pussy whipped?  You're pussy whipped.  Remember he was on the phone with his girlfriend?  And he said, it's like, hey, you know, what are you...  And you had to like...  Just in case you don't know what's going on, E-Rock, Sandy Kane's making fun of you because  you cried when you were talking to your girlfriend that day.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  Is that pussy whipped, Sandy?  Definitely.  He's definitely...  I mean, what kind of man are you to cry like that? 
[04:17:30]  What kind of man do you have?  Talking about your manhood.  Yeah, E-Rock.  I have a vibrator home, honey, and it's black because it doesn't show the dirt, so...  Just bringing your manhood into question there, E-Rock.  E-Rock, E-Rock, E-Rock, E-Rock, let me help you out.  You should have said it's black because it's been up your cunt.  Oh, oh, that's true.  Too late to line of the day to get in on that?  Line of the day.  E-Rock.  Can you hold the mic for Jeffrey Rush from Pirate in the Caribbean?  No, I'm just saying, are you still going up, you pussy whips? 
[04:18:00]  Now, how come you're pussy whipped, though?  You know, you shouldn't be.  Good question, E-Rock.  You're a handsome hunk of a man, you know?  E-Rock?  Yeah.  She's getting the best of you.  What's going on?  She really is.  I fucking hate you.  Okay, why?  Because you don't shut up.  You're annoying.  No one likes you.  No one likes me?  Why am I here, though?  Because you're easy to goof on.  Okay, so that's something, though.  It beats a blank.  I die already.  I just made money, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah, your face again.  No, really.  And I jerked a guy off.  Yeah, good for you.  Hey, he was a man.  He was a man.  He might be more of a fucking man than you, asshole.  All right.  No fucking way.  Yep.  I bet he's not pussy whipped.  Wow.  Are you taking a fucking beating, E-Rock?  No, really.  E-Rock.  Whatever the fuck.  E-Cock.  No cock.  Go, Sandy.  Holy shit.  Small dick.  I've never liked Sandy this much.  Small dick, I bet. 
[04:19:00]  A question in your dick's eyes.  You may want to go talk to the doctor after today.  Do what?  May I have my hemorrhoid removed?  No.  What?  I want to get a test.  A test of what?  Because I don't think we'll be seeing you much longer.  Why?  Do you think I'm going to die soon?  It's a safe bet.  Well, why?  Maybe you'll die first.  No.  Your money is on that you're not going to be here next time.  My money?  What the fuck?  Is that a threat?  What are you talking about?  I'm not going to be here.  Maybe you won't be here.  That's right.  No. 
[04:19:30]  You know, I'm just saying.  How can you say that to someone?  How could you say that to fucking Steven Tyler?  There's no reason for that.  I'm just saying.  I'm just saying.  Maybe you're the one that's going to die.  Maybe Jesus is up there looking at you and saying, motherfucker, she's going to live  and you're going to die.  Because I'm in church every fucking day.  And when I leave here, I'll go to church and say, thank God for Opie and Anthony, the  money I made and the fun I've had.  All right, so go donate all your money to the church.  Get honey on the pews.  No, and how it's being a comic and saying I'm on Opie and Anthony's show means a really  lot.  The peep booth is actually a confessional. 
[04:20:00]  And, you know, Al Martin over to New York at the Broadway.  I'm going to be there in February and March.  God bless Opie and Anthony for helping a lot.  Oh, thank you.  She kicked your ass, Iraq.  Fucking Sandy Kane gave you.  I'm a beating.  She fucking made you look stupid.  They're saying you got pwned.  Yep.  Not a real man.  And there's a couple of woots coming in.  I think you have a disorder.  As Anthony would say, you have a disorder about telling me to shut up.  I'm talking to you and you're saying shut up.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Taking something personally, I mean. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah.  You're on a radio show.  Maybe you shouldn't be so personal.  Exactly.  Have you not listened to this show?  Huh?  It's very personal.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  You should talk to your girlfriend like you're talking to me, okay?  Wow.  Right?  No, the way you, you're like, oh, shit.  And you walked out like that.  Wow.  I think they should kiss and make up.  No, I was surprised at you, man.  I was surprised at you.  Why were you surprised at him, Sandy?  Because I think he's a man.  He's working at the hottest radio show in the country.  And your girlfriend made you just like, you were speechless. 
[04:21:00]  Oh, man.  You had nothing to say, man.  Oh, shit.  I was really surprised at you.  I think you're more of a man.  But me, you could say, shut up.  I was really hoping we were going to hear some great E-Rock shit.  And E-Rock's had nothing.  He's been sitting there just taking this.  Yeah.  No, just maybe God's saying, you shut up.  God's going to take care of you in a few weeks.  God's going to take care of that.  Fucking Maud?  That's his fucking God.  God's going to get you for that.  That is the worst comeback I've ever heard.  God's going to get you?  God's going to get you for that, Walter.  What the fuck are you talking about? 
[04:21:30]  Make fun of Twato.  Make fun of that straw hair.  Make fun of the fact she has no nipples.  She was raped by Phil Spector.  How do you not bring that up?  Hey, and Richard Pryor.  Just tell her to stifle it, David.  Why don't you laugh?  Give me the green.  Yeah, why don't you tell her to stow it, Vic Tamex?  Fucking come on.  Kiss my grits.  I just ripped off a guy today.  I mean, I'm in my glory.  The best part is Santa Cain doesn't feel like she needs to clean her body off.  No, it's a lot better than a vibrator.  She's going to leave the studio like this.  There's some really good cleaning going on.  All right, well, Iraq, she gave you a beating. 
[04:22:00]  She beat you down.  Big titty, Sandy.  Shit.  Good job, Sandy.  You still have money stuck to you.  It's awful.  Get a hold of yourself.  Before she came in today, she had that.  Yeah, probably.  That's from the peep show.  They're stuck there from some guy's sperm.  All right, here's your line of the day.  Thank you, BodogFantasy.net.  Here comes the light of the day. 
[04:22:30]  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  Go.  Stewardess.  What?  Aeroplane.  Things on a plane.  Shut up for two minutes.  That game was hilarious, man.  That really was.  Hey, we did a lot today, but I think Timmy Tom certainly was the star of the show.  Timmy Tom with the game. 
[04:23:00]  And Judith Freelander at Caroline's all weekend long start tonight.  30 Rock.  A couple more episodes before you guys run out of episodes because of the writer's strike,  unfortunately.  But he's killing on that show as well.  He's a good friend of the show.  And we got Chris Rock in tomorrow.  Oh, nice.  I think 8 o'clock.  Wow.  Nice.  A real celebrity.  Yep.  Teasing, of course, to our current guest.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm still staring at the chicks cleaning up here.  They all fucking really smell good.  Oh, we got to play your band.  What's the name of the band?  What's the plug? 
[04:23:30]  This is how we leave today.  It's called Missiles and Markers.  That's the right track.  And it's, uh, why is it a bonus track if you guys want to promote this?  Does it matter?  It's old.  It's an older song.  And they really like it.  All right.  It's called Sweet Katie?  Yeah.  Who's Katie?  Oh, I don't know how to explain that one.  She's a whore, apparently.  Really?  Used to go out with one of the guys?  Yeah, the singer.  And what, he's just, is this an angry, angry song or when he was in love with her?  Yeah, you'll hear the lyrics. 
[04:24:00]  You'll kind of hear how.  No, I won't.  I got to hit the road.  Oh, come on.  I'm pushing start and getting the fuck out of here.  No, let's, uh, all right.  Missiles and Markers on MySpace.  They were on, uh, what's it called?  JV and Elvis when they were on K-Rock.  Oh, very cool.  And they played this song on K-Rock for that day.  No shit.  Awesome.  All right.  Well, you get another spin today.  Sweet Katie.  Thanks.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Well, we were only 17 and the trees, they turn his bed. 
[04:24:30]  As all the promises, your lips made as you fucked me in your bed.  I questioned your intentions.  You just shut me up again.  And all the bullets that you shot at me were aimed at hiding.  And she said, you're always on my mind.  She said, you're always on my mind. 
[04:25:00]  Well, I told you that I loved you when you've been a Christian dog.  My spaghetti, we said, me.  And I guess you make a living by enchanting hearts with all the mice we get in, we said, me.  Threw me out for winter and for months, I'm in the cold.  Broken glass full pictures from the wall. 
[04:25:30]  And I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  Well, I told you that I loved you when you said, no, Chris, you don't remind me. 
[04:26:00]  I said, you're always on my mind. 
[04:26:30]  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind.  I said, you're always on my mind. 
[04:27:00]  I said, you're always on my mind.  I love you and you share the crystal never lie  Guess you make a living by your jam  See us alone now, you're crazy  My special baby, and I'm taking you  I'm holding you down, you're crazy  I'm not so kidding, but you're kidding  Let's drive you crazy  I'm freaking, I'm freaking  Why you're jammed and I'm alone  I'm freaking, I'm freaking  We're escaping 
[04:27:30]  Every knee must bend, every head must bow  Every tongue must confess  Thou art the greatest, the greatest of all time  Ella, Ella, A, A  Yeah, we suck  Opie and Anthony, y'all </pre>
