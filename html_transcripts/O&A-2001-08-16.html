<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with preparations for a post-show event: a magazine signing at Hooters, and lap dances for Blind Dave and Matt, who participated in a "Blind Boxing" match earlier.  The hosts extensively discuss the recent firing of Boston Red Sox manager Jimmy Williams, with a caller speculating it was due to the general manager's infidelity.  A significant portion focuses on the "WOW Summit" in Philadelphia, a promotional event featuring the show's hosts and numerous women.  The hosts recount humorous anecdotes from the event, including their motorcycle ride, interactions with fans (both enthusiastic and unenthusiastic), and various mishaps.  Callers share their experiences, often focusing on the women's physical attributes and using explicit language.  Several women who attended the WOW Summit call in, describing their participation and reacting to the often crude commentary.  The "cigarette WOW" photo, featuring women smoking while lifting their shirts, becomes a recurring theme.  

The show includes a discussion of Blind Dave's previous injury and the chaotic "Blind Boxing" match, featuring both laughter and explicit descriptions of the event. Comedians Rich Voss and Tom phone in and are subjected to harsh criticism from Opie and Anthony.  A call from Jennifer, a WOW Summit participant, focuses heavily on her large breasts.  The show features a song by "Brother Joe" about domestic violence, inspired by Dickie Betts' alleged assault on his wife.  This transitions to a discussion of an underage-appearing Sports Illustrated model and recollections of the previous year's "55-gallon drum challenge," involving women and unpleasant substances.  The hosts heavily promote an upcoming "Dwarf-a-palooza" event, making numerous offensive jokes about dwarfs and disabilities.  Jamie Lynn Siegler calls in to promote her Maxim magazine appearance, leading to discussions of her photos and personal life.

A studio conversation with Jamie Lynn follows,  covering her career, dating preferences (older men), and her brother's arrest.  The hosts make sexually suggestive comments throughout. The show revisits the "55-gallon drum challenge," playing audio of the women's reactions.  Blind Matt and Blind Dave are in studio, receiving lap dances from strippers from Privilege Gentleman's Club.  The resulting scene is chaotic, involving heavy drinking and sexually suggestive behavior.  The hosts discuss sponsorships, the Hooters magazine signing, and a caller complaining about their website's lack of credit for photos used on opiananthony.com.  The discussion is punctuated by off-color jokes and references to celebrities.

A heavily intoxicated Craig joins the broadcast, along with numerous callers and studio guests, focusing on a visit to Privilege strip club.  Callers and hosts make crude comments about the dancers.  Humorous anecdotes are shared, including a story about "country water giving you dwarves," and Dave's urgent bathroom break following his lap dance.  There are repeated explicit jokes about Matt's genitals.  A stripper from Privilege calls to promote a party.  The segment ends with a promotion for the post-show Hooters party and the magazine signing.  The broadcast is consistently filled with vulgar language and offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P. and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O&A show.  We have lots to do today.  Don't forget, right after the show tonight, we're doing a magazine signing party downstairs at Hooters.  Yes, we are.  Just another excuse to get out there and hang and drink and stuff.  Yeah.  It's going to be a party.  We're going to get a lot of the people you know and love from this show to hang and to show up. 
[00:00:30]  It's Hooters 56th Street between Broadway and 7th Avenue in the hearts of Manhattan.  Yeah, we'll be there.  We want to talk about the WOW Summit.  We want to talk about getting WOW on live TV.  That happened last night.  Ouch.  But there's breaking news, Anthony.  Breaking news.  Boston.  The Boston Red Sox fired manager Jimmy Williams in the middle of a playoff race. 
[00:01:00]  Aww.  What happened there?  That is your name.  Do they have pictures of him, like, touching kids or something?  You don't hire your manager during a playoff race.  Why did they do that?  Ben, comment.  It says, Boston has lost six of seven games, but still was only two games behind the A's in the AL wild card standings 
[00:01:30]  and five games behind the Yankees in the AL East through Wednesday.  The Red Sox have been plagued by injuries, including to stars Pedro Martinez and Omar Garcia-Para.  And the team currently has eight players on the disabled list.  So, basically, right there, it's really not his fault that, you know, they're in a little slump there, Anthony.  We feel that it is in the best interest of the organization to make a managerial change at this time for everyone concerned,  especially Red Sox fans.  General Manager Dan Duquette said in a statement,  Williams' replacement was not announced immediately, so they don't even know who's going to be coaching. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, man.  See, that's something weird.  It's like a quick thing.  It wasn't thought out.  You know, they didn't have some guy there ready to step in, so something happened.  Yeah, Duquette's a douche.  I remember when we used to live up there.  Ernie.  Hey, ONA.  It's great to have you back on Rhode Island Airwave.  Oh, right on, Ernie.  What's going on?  Just calling about the Red Sox.  I mean, they should have fired a few of the players rather than the manager. 
[00:02:30]  I think it's kind of ridiculous.  You guys got to be losing your minds today.  Oh, man.  You don't fire the manager during a playoff race.  Nah.  And no replacement to Boat.  I'm sure they'll name someone in the next few hours.  Oh, yeah, no doubt.  That would be something if they do turn it around.  But, I mean, as soon as we got our good players back, then the team just went down.  Like, it had heart.  We had nobodies on the team.  You know, we had, you know, like Steins.  And they were all playing their hearts out.  And that's how they got to where they were.  Then we'd get Nomar back. 
[00:03:00]  You know, call Everett back.  Hey, Ernie.  Thanks for calling WEEI.  All right.  Your sports leader.  That's right.  Thanks, Ernie.  No problem.  We just want to bring it up as a headline and move on with the show.  Yeah.  It's just pretty crazy to fire your manager during the playoff race.  Jimmy Williams.  How's it going, guys?  All right.  All right.  Well, I just wanted to give you the inside story on what really happened.  Yeah.  That douche, Dan Duque, you see, caught me with his little lady two days ago.  So that's why he decided to get rid of me. 
[00:03:30]  You know who my replacement is?  It's this other douche, Joe Kerrigan, who's been his little kiss-ass for the past couple  of years.  Yeah.  So, you know what I'm going to do, guys?  I'm heading down the Hooters right now to meet up with you guys.  Oh, cool.  And then I'm going to catch a few Yankee games.  Go Yanks.  Hey, don't wait until 7, man.  There's going to be a party going on before we get there.  I'm heading down now, boys.  All right, cool.  Can't wait to see you.  Thank you, man.  So, there you go.  That's breaking news.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Anthony.  Ouch.  I guess we've got to talk about the WOW Summit.  Philadelphia, you know, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is syndicated to 12 cities at this point.  And Philadelphia just coming alive.  Right on board.  Coming right on board.  Well, day one, a little rough.  Remember day one in Philly?  You suck.  Shut up.  Play the music.  Get off the air.  I hate you.  We don't want you.  We'll never like you.  I do believe we're starting to find our audience in Philadelphia.  Yeah, there's people coming aboard.  There were a lot of crazy mother effers down there when Keith and the gang on their Harleys  showed up with the girls to WOW. 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  And we've got some great pictures.  We're still going through them.  We're going to have them on the website, hopefully in the very near future, opieandanthony.com.  We've got pictures up now, but they're pretty boring.  Yeah.  We'll have the good stuff up there very soon, all right?  How about the Philly girls that joined in?  That was kind of nice.  That was really nice.  You know, some Philly cans showing up and touring off the show.  They gave us a run for our money, I think.  I saw some big ones.  We watched a videotape that someone sent us.  Yeah, we're going to have some of those clips on foundrymusic.com later on today. 
[00:05:00]  And man, I don't know, there's something in the water, some of that Philly water, because  I saw some big tease on that tape.  So Keith's back in the studio.  I heard you guys got back at what, like 1 in the morning?  Yeah, about 1.30 in the morning.  1.30 in the morning.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that kind of does suck when you drive all that way, you ride all that way, and  now you're at a bar.  You want to party a little bit, but then you have to ride a bike all the way back.  Yeah, it's true, but we were having a really good time, and the people in Philly were great. 
[00:05:30]  They really came out.  They showed support every place we went.  And after the bar, we went to eat.  We went over to Pat's Steaks, and Pat's Steaks, they hooked everybody up with dinner.  Got to say thanks to Frank and the gang down there.  Cool.  That rocks.  Well, thanks for the support.  Yeah, really.  I mean, it was unbelievable to hear on the radio, but to see the video, there were a  hell of a lot of people down there when you guys arrived.  It worked out really well.  I mean, beforehand, I had a couple problems.  Like, one of my friends got the gout, and I thought they did away with the gout with 
[00:06:00]  polio or something.  Yeah, that sounds like some ancient disease, the gout.  I was like, oh my God, one of the girls had food poisoning, but the whole thing came together  and went real smooth.  The gout.  What is the gout?  That's what you use to caulk your bathtub, I think.  It has to do with caulk?  It has to do with your caulk?  Caulk.  You know, when you caulk your bathtub.  Caulk your tub?  Yeah.  I don't want the gout then.  You go to the Home Depot, and you get some of that gout. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, gout for your caulk.  Right.  Okay, I got you.  Yeah.  Sure.  I thought that was grout.  Depends on what city you're in.  Yeah.  I'm sure someone out there pronounces it gout.  Crazy Paul, what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, people?  Hey.  Hey, Keith.  First of all, it did not go that smooth.  Did you forget to tell them we ended up in the slums where they had never seen white people  and everybody was pointing at us?  Yeah, we were a little off track when we got into Philadelphia. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, Crazy Paul.  Yo.  We hear from a few people you were a big pain in the ass.  A pain in the ass?  Yeah, you were just a pain in the ass the whole night at the bar.  Oh, stop it.  Like grabbing the mic away from people.  No.  I wasn't even on the stage.  You wanted to be the center of attention.  Excuse me.  Never happened.  Once I picked up the mic, it didn't work.  I brought the girl up the first girl summer to show her boobs.  Oh, so now you're saying you were on the stage. 
[00:07:30]  Huh?  So now you're saying you were on the stage.  Only for the first two minutes that I went to the back.  Why is Keith being quiet?  Was Crazy Paul cool or what?  Uh, yeah.  Ah.  Wait a minute.  He got mad.  Everybody, everybody thought, first of all, they thought I was Earl because I was wearing black.  Yeah.  Then I thought it was cowbell built because I was wearing a cowbell.  Yeah.  But, hey, it was a blast.  Okay.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  There was a lot of cool things that happened.  The people on the overpass on the Jersey Turnpike were amazing.  Why were they amazing? 
[00:08:00]  They were just...  I was waiting for that.  Psycho Tim, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I have to say, first of all, thumbs up to Keith the Cops for that ride yesterday.  Yeah.  That's what makes Harley riding holly what's all about.  That's a good idea.  There should be an annual event, the WOW.  Hey, we got a lot more cities to hit with the WOW Summit, so...  Just because I'm crippled right now for riding for 12 hours, but that's all right.  Did you tell me about his little bike fast incident last night or no? 
[00:08:30]  No.  What happened?  Well, we were kind of...  I don't know.  We were on some highway, of course, in the middle of nowhere, wherever we were in New York,  and the traffic was brewing.  We were dying.  The girls were dying in the back.  So we made the Harleys into, like, pedal bikes, let's just say.  And we were driving on the bike path of some park.  Another one bites the dust.  Keith.  There's no patience today.  Did you bring anyone down there that has a brain that could, like, communicate to our listeners about what happened? 
[00:09:00]  I guess we'll have a kind of...  That was actually an HOV lane.  That wasn't...  It was just closed at the time.  What the hell?  I don't even know what he was saying.  The story was going nowhere.  Heather, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  I was there yesterday with Tim.  Yeah, one of the girls that were on the back of the bikes.  Yes, it was such an awesome time.  Cool.  Which one were you?  I was...  Heather, I rode with Tim.  Just a short little blonde...  Yeah.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Very cute.  And I'm very upset, because once I wowed you, Opie said,  Oh, well, we'll take a small one, too. 
[00:09:30]  After I went up and said my size.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  I was trying to make you feel good, because, you know...  Oh, thanks.  A lot of girls think that guys just want to see big boobs.  That is not true.  No.  That's a fallacy.  No.  You were very cute, and you had a nice set.  I had such a good time.  I'm so glad he convinced me to come.  Oh, good, man.  And I was rubbing Tim's back so he wouldn't be sore.  I was scratching his back while we were on the bike with my nails.  Oh, cool.  Heather, you're rocking.  Thanks for helping us out.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm looking at some pictures.  I see the old broad that they had there. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, the pictures are up?  The good pictures?  Yeah.  No, not up yet.  Oh, they're not up yet?  I went to a website that has some pictures.  They'll be up soon.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  And she was, what, 50 or so?  She was about 50, yeah.  Yeah.  She's a trooper.  She was in there.  She had a nice set for her age.  That she did.  Some lady from Philly.  She was about 50, maybe a little older, even.  And then I was looking at a picture of me and Opie.  We've been laughing about this whole thing with the wow shots for quite a while.  The cigarette wow. 
[00:10:30]  It's the shot where the girl has the cigarette in her hand, but now in order to pull up her  shirt, she's got to put the butt in her mouth.  And it just takes away from it when she's got that one eye shut because the smoke's going  in there making her eye like a radish.  And she's got it half shut, and she's got the mouth cocked over and got the butt hanging  out, and she's lifting up her shirt to show it can.  Check out this for a while.  You know, they got that, man.  The Edward G. Robinson side of the mouth.  And the girl that you're looking at, she's very attractive, but that whole cigarette thing, 
[00:11:00]  man, it's just...  They ain't got the smoke in the car.  You got to go...  Oh, you want a wow?  You want a wow?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  I need to put the cigarette in the mouth and squint this eye.  I'll squint it.  No.  Well, how's that?  A nice tease?  Yeah, so it takes away.  Psycho Tim.  What's going on?  Sorry.  Hey, what happened?  I don't know.  We're going to have a man walking the moon, but I can't get a cell phone call in Boston.  Danny, he'll never learn.  He's going to learn the hard way. 
[00:11:30]  He says, I'm calling back.  I got disconnected.  No, you didn't.  Oh, my God.  This picture of Stalker Patty.  She's flashing her 45-year-old virgin cans, and she has a look on her face.  Well, she looks like a retarded kid staring at a Ferris wheel.  Look, and we all know what that looks like.  Either the Ferris wheel or the miracle that is the cotton candy machine at the fair.  Maybe that's it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  The pictures are up, Anthony, so you can play along at home. 
[00:12:00]  The good picture.  Oh, great.  That's opieandanthony.com, all right?  Let's go to Kaz, another one of the ladies that made it to Philadelphia with us yesterday.  Kaz, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I'm hysterical laughing still over the cigarette that you're talking about.  It's totally me.  Wow, this is a good one.  Wait, which one are you, Kaz?  I'm the tall, skinny one.  Ponytails in my hair.  Oh, yeah.  You're the one with the cigarette shot.  Oh, great.  Please do.  You're hot, but it's funny when you girls, like, put the cigarette in your mouth. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, we get Bell's palsy all of a sudden.  Hey, I'm good.  Hey, how about that, King?  I can't believe I'm the drinker coming in the rain.  The crowd in Philly, they were wonderful.  A lot of people came out, and, Keith, thank you.  It was a great day.  I've done a lot of things in my life, and this is definitely one of, you know.  You guys are the talk of two cities today.  Oh, wow.  Well, many cities, but, I mean, you know, the people in New York and the people in Philly got to check you out.  But I have a little commentary.  Once we got down to Philly, we didn't know we had to be on stage, so we all kind of, we were tired from, you know, wowing and being on the bikes all day. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  So we get down to Philly, and they put us on stage, and it was like insects running around a piece of somebody's sandwich just running to the stage with all these men and cameras.  So we did what we could.  Well, Anthony and I were talking about that, too, because someone gave us a videotape of what was going on down there in Philly.  And we got to tell Philadelphia and the other cities listening, you know, this is just a little taste of what we can do for you guys.  Usually we do, you know, an all-out road show where you're going to be entertained for four or five straight hours. 
[00:13:30]  This was just a little taste.  There was three or four hundred guys at this bar.  Keith's got all the girls on stage, and the reason they're there is to just show their cans to Philly.  So all of a sudden it's like, you know, whip them out, whip them out, and the girls show their bones.  Yay!  So now you girls have done what you went there for, and then all of a sudden it's like, okay, now what do we do?  All right, well, let's show them again.  Woo!  Okay.  See, I think they expected a little bit of a debauchery that happened at the road show.  So, you know, and we were, you know, we weren't drinking all day. 
[00:14:00]  No, that was just a goodwill gesture, just a little taste of what this show is all about.  But it was just funny, because it was obvious that you girls had nothing else, and that's okay.  I'm not trashing you.  Oh, we had a great time, and there were a lot of great people.  Okay, we flashed three times.  What do we do now?  All right, let's flash again.  Woo!  Let's do it in a different order now.  Woo!  Combinations!  Patty and you and you!  Woo!  Hey, Patty's a trooper.  Patty is a trooper.  I was complaining by the end of the day.  My loins are still vibrating right now. 
[00:14:30]  Nice.  I've never been on a motorcycle.  I'm not a trooper.  I'm a worker.  Yeah.  A worker.  Body like an ant.  She had on a helmet at one point, and she looked like Ponch from Chips.  It was, like, hanging over her eyes.  It was great.  That must have...  She really looked like an ant with a big helmet.  Oh, she's a trooper.  She's great.  I hold on to the bike easy, because I put my legs on the foot pedals, and I still got four  more to hold on to the guy with...  Know who she looked like yesterday on that stage from the video? 
[00:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  Geddy Lee.  She really looked like Geddy Lee yesterday.  Modern day warrior, mean, mean, straight today, Tom Sawyer, mean, mean, bright, I'll  sleep.  Well, it was a great time, and thank you so much for letting me be involved.  I just want to give a nice little F to you to the guys who are in the back of the crowd  that called me fried egg peas.  Now, listen, I had a baby a little over a year ago.  I think I looked pretty damn good. 
[00:15:30]  Some people never, ever satisfied.  Gravity took into my ninnies, you know.  I have to understand, but give us respect.  The first rule of wow is don't harass the ladies.  Yeah, you got to respect the ladies, even if they have little gravy stains.  Yeah.  I understand.  Gravity took its place, but I'll let you guys go.  Right on, Cash.  Thank you.  Good luck, Keith.  It was great.  I had a great time, and I'm looking forward to doing it again.  Appreciate you coming.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, we came up with something new.  Tracy, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:16:00]  What's going on?  Another one of the ladies that were doing the wowing down there in Philly for us.  Yeah, that was absolutely insane.  Tracy is the cigarette girl.  Oh, you're the one with the cigarette?  Oh, yeah.  They were calling me tattoo girl, and, like, I had just wowed, and they were like, tattoo  girl, chat.  And I was like, oh, I just lit a cigarette.  Like, what do you guys don't want?  I'll just put him around and shut my one eye here and take a picture.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I saw that.  I saw that.  Oh, my God.  We got quite a slobber knocker going on here. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, come on.  No, Tracy, you're beautiful, but Anthony and I have been talking about this for a while,  where, like, you know, girls want to flash, and they just happen to be smoking, so they  put the cigarette in, and they squint the one eye and lift up their shirt.  It's funny.  I'm not going to do it then and then get booed, like, for not doing it then.  Like, those guys, they got raw, because we really, honestly, did not know we were going  on stage.  Yeah.  And we were just in shock.  He's like, this way, please.  And we just, you know, okay, we listen to Keith.  Yeah, that's the best.  Cool.  And then the Philly girls joined you guys on stage, I saw.  Well, yeah, we met a few of them in the bathroom, and they were like, you know. 
[00:17:00]  There was one girl with just a monstrous set.  We had, like, cokes, and we were like, yeah, it's all right.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  You know, you'll be the first girls in Philly to do this.  Come on.  She had so much breast meat up top and to the, like, the side that the nip was way over  here.  And they were natural, though.  Like, they fell out of her shirt, and then all the whole crowd started the Holy S, Holy S chant.  But the ride down there was amazing.  It was great.  People were, they were just so nice, and just waving thumbs up, and, like, yeah, and the  people on the bridges were insane. 
[00:17:30]  Every bridge we went through, everybody was just sitting there waving, got their wow signs  out.  All right.  Cool.  It was a great time.  Thanks, Tracy.  Thanks, guys.  You coming down to Hooters tonight?  I'm going to try to.  Yeah, we're going to have a party tonight right after the show.  All right.  I'm going to try to get there.  It never ends with this radio program.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I figure we'll all need rehab by 2003.  Let's go to Tom.  We'll be in good company.  Tom, you're next on Opie and Anthony.  Everyone's there.  Hey, Tom.  Dude, did you see the one chick, man?  She's got, like, one boob up by her pit. 
[00:18:00]  The other one's almost even with her navel.  Well, she looks like she's been in a Gravitron for a month.  Stinky rules.  It could have been that.  That's it.  Yikes.  The Gravitron.  Wow.  Not only that, but in order to feed that tremendous right breast, there is a blood vessel the size  of an aorta running to the areola.  Well, hell, it's got to keep those boobs alive. 
[00:18:30]  They're so big.  It's alive.  It's alive.  Put your head on your chest.  It sounds like a Toyota Corolla with a kicker box in the back seat passing it.  That is a blood vessel.  Colleen, what's going on?  Nothing much.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You're from Philly, and you helped us out with the WOW Summit?  I sure did.  Cool.  You got to meet our ladies and some of the guys from the show, huh?  Yep.  They're really great. 
[00:19:00]  Do you smoke cigarettes?  Cool, Colleen.  Yeah, it looked like everyone was having a great time.  That's cool.  We're going to do more stuff like this.  We had such a great time.  Did you flash?  Yes, I did.  Which one were you?  The one with the plaid shirt on with the khaki shorts on.  I don't know.  I haven't seen your pick yet.  Yeah, you'll see them.  All right.  Cool.  Well, thanks, Colleen.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Yeah.  The cool thing is we did that for our 50th show for Philly. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  We're coming down there live to do the whole show, and we're going to have a party and a  concert and everything for the 100th show.  We'll throw a bash.  We're halfway there, so let's start counting it down, all right?  Are you staying in town tonight?  Yeah.  Because Mike on Lungan Level wanted to know if you were staying at the Crab Hotel after  Hooters.  Oh, no.  The Crab Crack Hotel.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  I just want to thank you guys for that kind offering you gave us yesterday.  A little taste.  A little taste of what we could do. 
[00:20:00]  It was a good time.  Cool.  There's nothing like breath to bring a whole city together.  Yeah.  I'll tell you that.  We were all getting along yesterday.  Yes.  I even had a guy on my way home.  I was going 70 miles an hour at 95.  A guy pulled up next to me and looked over and was like, hey, were you there?  And, you know.  Cool.  I'm like, yeah.  Everybody came together.  Camaraderie of fans.  Very cool.  By the way, that girl who was just on was really hot.  Oh, really?  All right.  We'll check out our picks.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  If you couldn't make it yesterday or you're in another city, go to opieandanthony.com 
[00:20:30]  and see the picks from the little summit thing.  Kenny.  Yo, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Thanks a lot for yesterday.  And I just want to tell you, that girl was not hot.  She looked like Sloth from the Goonies.  You guys are hot.  And I was smothered by Salker Patty yesterday.  What do you mean?  She went on having a half-hour conversation with me, telling me about how she lived in  Philly once.  Oh, my God.  Worked at PCCY Yogurt and was in charge of slicing the bananas. 
[00:21:00]  You got stuck with that, man.  My friends were all laughing at me as I'm staring at the hairs on her chin.  It looked like pubes.  Oh, it's a mess.  The tobacco in her teeth alone.  No, that's called cilia.  Yeah, and I use it to find my path back to the ant hole.  I know it looks like I have a mouthful of peanut butter, but those are my teeth.  Thank you, Kenny. 
[00:21:30]  No problem, guys.  You know how to make it.  Here's how you could play along at home and make Patty's teeth.  Here's what you do.  Go to the store and buy some Hubba Bubba chewing gum, the bubble gum.  Put five packs in your mouth and chew it up.  Okay, now take it out and form them into a huge set of gums.  Now, at the same store you bought that, buy those mini chicklets, the little ones.  Pick out the white ones and a couple of brown ones and shove them in the chewed up Hubba Bubba. 
[00:22:00]  Now, bend it in the shape of a mouth and there you go, Patty's mouth.  Add a chin with Silly Putty and just pull out your own pew for a beard.  Scott, what's up?  Yo, you know what chick you had to check out?  They had the one girl.  She had, I don't know what was on her skin, but she was as orange as like a pumpkin.  Was it the tanning stuff?  Her hands are white, around her eyes are white. 
[00:22:30]  And then when she pulled down her top, you know what it looked like?  It looked like someone took string and cut off the circulation to the rest of her body except for her breast.  How big were her cans?  They were all right.  You know, I guess they were like bees.  But, I mean, it was hard to concentrate just on that orange skin.  I'm actually asking you not to just find out how big her boobs were, but try to identify the girl you're talking about.  I'll tell you what, if you look at the one picture with the group together, it's the girls together. 
[00:23:00]  It's the second girl from the left.  But it says on the screen they look like pumpkins because they were so orange.  Oh, no, no.  Her breasts were as white as like a t-shirt.  It was the rest of her body that was orange.  Right.  It was like an unbelievable look.  If someone thought that was attractive, they would have to be blind.  You guys are amazing.  But, I mean, it was a great time yesterday.  We send you boobs.  And you're picking them apart.  And you're being all bitchy about it.  Come on.  I'll tell you what, the Philly girls blew away the New York girl. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, challenge.  Oh, New York, did you hear that?  There's a challenge.  I mean, the one girl, it looked like she got bit by a mosquito.  She has had two little bumps.  Oh.  Do you have girls in Philly that'll take a Budweiser can?  Well, more likely.  You sound like you guys went through a couple of those neighborhoods when you got lost.  You just wait until we come down with a road show.  You're going to be amazed.  So, yeah, I'm looking forward to it.  It was a good time yesterday.  You know, it was a whole bunch of dudes.  But you were right.  Like, once the girls got done off the stage, like, all the guys were standing around looking at each other. 
[00:24:00]  Like, man, what do we do now?  It just turned into, like, a homo party or something.  Welcome to the family.  All right.  All right, dude.  Thanks, guys.  Later, thanks.  That's funny.  He's funny.  What the hell?  Someone took string and cut off the circulation to the rest of the party.  Yeah.  Turn down your radio.  That's a really long delay.  That was a long delay.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  We said that about three minutes ago, I think.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What do you got for the radio show?  Nothing, man. 
[00:24:30]  We're on our way up to meet the stoner guys who went up and bought them a new piece to donate.  We heard they're poor.  You're coming from Philly to our little magazine signing party tonight?  Yeah, we're on our way right now.  Oh, that's cool.  Cool, man.  Yeah, they'll appreciate it.  No problem, man.  We went out to a great place and bought them a nice little piece.  They'll love it.  All right.  He just had his Home Depot pipe.  All right, Paul.  We'll see you at Hooters right after the show.  All right, man.  See you there.  It's 56 between Broadway and 7th.  Right.  All invited.  Right at 7th.  We're just going downstairs and partying. 
[00:25:00]  Even some more.  I don't even know where to go.  The phones are just going nuts about the wow selling.  Yeah, everyone.  I'm just trying to get something a little new.  So, everyone had a good time.  Oh, here's the old broad.  Although some people are a little picky with their boobs.  Here's the old broad.  Karen.  Yeah.  You're the old broad.  Yeah, I sure am.  All right.  Listen to you.  Hold on before you get mad.  Okay.  Someone will back me up.  What?  What did I say when I saw this old broad on the stage showing her boobs?  Oh, because she ain't bad, man.  Thank you.  And I'd surely bang her before I bang Stalker Patty. 
[00:25:30]  Please, I meant Stalker Patty.  So, that's kind of a compliment, right?  I don't think so.  No, not much.  I'm looking at your cans right now, and you've done a very good job of keeping yourself in good shape.  You know what?  I was on my way to the grocery store.  Yeah.  I just knew guys all the time.  Cool.  And I was like, you just kept going and going with the guys going over the bridge and the  motorcycles, and I just got, like, totally caught up in it. 
[00:26:00]  And I thought, screw the shop, and I'm going over.  Yeah.  When I walked in, it was all men.  Well, they want to see boobs.  Well, I just, but the thing is, there's more to you guys than just the boobs.  You know what I mean?  Let me tell you something, though.  When we first started in New York, that's all we got, too.  And now we've gotten a lot of women to start coming to our things in New York.  Yeah.  They realize that we don't bite, and we have a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Hey, Karen, how old are you?  Yeah, that's the other thing. 
[00:26:30]  Uh-oh.  I said 40.  I said 38.  46.  There you go.  All right.  There you go.  No, somebody was saying 50, and then he said, ah, a little bit more than 50.  That was Ben.  And I was trying so hard to get through, like, I was getting madder and madder.  Stupid Ben.  Stupid Ben.  And Karen, you've got to recognize all the voices.  That was Ben.  Okay.  Ben says all that crazy crap.  Stupid Ben?  Yeah.  That's who you blame everything on?  I had you at 40.  Yeah.  Did you really?  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  You know, I'll be honest.  I said 44.  Okay.  Well, 46 is, you know, close to me.  I don't mind my age.  You know, I just, but I was so disappointed in the Philadelphia women.  I really was.  I just thought there would be so many more there.  Well, it's, uh, we're 50 shows deep in.  In Philly.  Yeah, we've just begun.  You just wait, all right?  All right, Karen.  Thanks for being a sport.  We're just messing with you.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Not a problem.  All right.  Listen, is my face up on that, too?  Like, will people know me?  Uh, maybe.  Why?  I don't know.  Because I talked to the one guy, and he said they'd probably blow the faces. 
[00:27:30]  And I said, oh, okay.  Well.  No, I don't think we have a face shot, because, uh, ooh.  Uh, thank you, Karen.  Oh, you're so suspicious.  I am.  That's a joke.  Uh, it's a little joke.  A little joke.  Uh, Ben, saying that she was 50, Ben.  Pat.  I had her in the message.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, I just want to let you guys know, you made a wow on NBC10 last night, Dan in Philly. 
[00:28:00]  You know what?  You know something, Matt.  I think the other cities are getting a little pissed off.  We're spending a lot of time on Philly.  But you know what?  Philly is coming to the table big time.  Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for about two years now in syndication underground.  I was happier than a pig in S when you moved down to, came down to Philly.  Right.  And best part, it was a live shot.  Trouble is, it was about a cop that was shot at Franklin Mills Mall last night.  Yeah, you know something?  Uh, the story itself is pretty bad.  It's, uh, yeah, a cop that was shot. 
[00:28:30]  That's never good.  But, uh, the thing is, the guys never know what the hell the live shot's going to be  about when they run out into the camera.  Yeah, they just jump on out.  So, you know, that's what we're concentrating on.  They're just in the wings all freaked out.  They see the live, uh, you know, news crew, and they're like, oh my God, this is my chance  to get Wow on live TV or Opie and Anthony on live TV.  We encourage all the, all the fine cities to do this, by the way.  Yeah.  I've been listening to you guys two and a half years now.  You're great.  I hope, uh, that kid calls in, but I'm looking for the email of the whole store. 
[00:29:00]  Did I give it to you, Ant?  Yeah.  Oh, you got it.  Go ahead.  I got a few of these.  Um, this one says, Tools, last night, Channel 10 News in Philly, uh, guys trying to do  a live shot from a shooting in, uh, Franklin Mills.  This nut job runs on scene with a wow sign.  Guy runs away, then jumps back in, uh, the scene yelling, Opie and Anthony.  The reporter gets all pissed off and just, uh, starts saying, let's just go to the tape.  Let's just go to the tape.  It totally ruined his live shot. 
[00:29:30]  These reporters live for their live shots.  Oh, he wasn't happy.  Uh, another guy, I'm sitting there watching the news, uh, about a story about a mile away  from me.  A reporter's talking.  And a kid runs over with a wow sign, screaming your guy's name.  He was pissed.  We, uh, encourage this to happen.  It's called assault on the media.  Yeah.  Hey, Boston, doesn't that sound familiar?  Yeah.  Doesn't that sound like somebody else pulled that out of the hat after we left town? 
[00:30:00]  Something we've been doing for many years.  But, uh, the reason we do this, we don't really have any advertising for the Opie and Anthony  show.  So, to spread the word, we, we do grassroots, uh, underground type things.  And this is one way to get, uh, the name of the show out there.  Yeah.  And to get wow out there as well.  And it also makes for some funny radio and some funny TV.  We had a guy up here that, uh, was in a Gumby, uh, costume.  We've had the Gumby costume guy, the gorilla, the guy in the gorilla mask that scared the  crap out of, uh, one of the anchors.  Right. 
[00:30:30]  Uh, or one of the, uh, field guys.  And then the, uh, ice thing.  The thing that happened with the ice.  It was very icy out.  You know, it was funny at the time, but we don't, we don't encourage this.  Uh, one of the reporters here in New York, he's an older guy.  What's his name again?  Maury Alter.  Maury Alter.  Maury Alter.  Maury Alter has been on, um, uh, New York TV forever.  He's got to be 60 something.  And he's, uh, doing a report outside Letterman's, uh, uh, studio after Letterman came back from  his, uh, surgery.  Yeah.  His heart surgery.  And one of our guys, uh, one of our listeners goes running up to, to Maury while he's doing 
[00:31:00]  this live shot.  It was winter.  He went to run up behind him because the whole trick is, uh, before the guys can come out of  the trailer, the techs and everybody else and stop you from interrupting the live shot.  You got to get in there.  So the sidewalk's icy.  So he goes to run up behind Maury and yell, Opie and Anthony hold up his wow sign.  He runs up, tries to stop.  The sidewalk is icy.  He slides right into Maury.  Hip checks him.  Hip checks him.  This is all on live television. 
[00:31:30]  I'm watching it at home going, oh my God.  Now Maury's like, he's turning around and now you see guys from the truck jump out and  they're now fighting with these three guys because they have a huge wow banner.  And you see the wow sign just flapping in the breeze as he's trying to hold it and run  away.  The techs have him.  They're trying to grab him.  And Maury is yelling, over here, over here, because the cameraman turned the camera to  look at the scene that was going on, the fight.  So Maury's like, over here, over here.  And they put the camera back on Maury.  And I was like, okay, well. 
[00:32:00]  And then tries to get back into what he was talking about.  Go to the tape.  And of course, yeah, the A-bomb, we called it.  The atomic bomb.  It was the C-word on live TV.  Yeah, that came out of nowhere on NBC.  We've been doing this for quite a while.  And the people in Boston might ring a bell.  It might sound a little familiar.  After we left town, somebody else picked it up.  Yeah, but, uh, get Rocco and Berzy on TV. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, please.  We've been doing this forever.  We have great success stories.  We got, uh, you know, live boobies on the Today Show.  On the Today Show.  Uh, so there you go.  It's starting to happen in Philly already.  Uh, wow, and Opie and Anthony on live TV, man.  That's cool.  We better take a quick break here, huh?  All right.  We're having fun today.  More of your calls.  Oh, why don't we give away, uh, tickets to the X Games?  How many do we have?  I'm going to give, uh, two for Philly. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, uh, before we move on with the show, we got a couple pairs of tickets, um, for our  Philadelphia listeners.  You get, uh, winner received, cut the line passes, VIP seats, and an exclusive invitation  to the Sobey Adrenaline Rush Maxim Magazine Party featuring top X Games athletes, right?  Yep.  Is that good enough?  Good.  All right, we'll take two random calls for that.  Opie and Anthony.  Join ONA at Hooters on 56th between Broadway and 7th Avenue this afternoon after the show. 
[00:33:30]  Bring down any one of ONA's recent magazine articles.  Rolling Stone, High, FHM, New York Magazine.  And they'll sign it for you.  Anthony, Lifestyles condoms.  You got your rubbers?

JD from Brooklyn writes,  Stalker Patty looks like John Lennon on those WOW Summit pics.  There's a little John Lennon action going on there.  Yeah, I could see it.  She's kind of walking down the hall.  Oh, boy. 
[00:35:30]  We let Patty in real fast.  We want to move on to other things.  We got to talk about blind boxing.  Got to get to the hissing cockroaches.  Yeah.  Jamie Lynn Siegler calling in today.  She looks so...  Metal Soprano.  Metal Soprano.  I know she looks so effing hot in the latest issue of Maxim Magazine.  She's on the cover.  Hi, Patty.  Hi, Anthony.  How was your day yesterday? 
[00:36:00]  Did you have a lot of fun?  I had a great time.  You did?  Yeah, I never rode on a motorbike before.  A motorbike?  Yeah, I thought I'd be scared and I was really calm.  It was groovy.  A motorbike.  A motorbike.  By the time I got to Pennsylvania, you could ask Keith.  I was like, look, no hands.  Oh, very risky behavior.  Is that because you were stuck to the seat?  Yeah, really.  Well, the air keeps you there.  Patty, I didn't think that was the air. 
[00:36:30]  Those things rumble a bit, right?  Well, the seat vibrates.  Vibrates.  Especially going over bumps and that was fun.  Now, I bet.  Patty, usually that sounds hot.  Did you feel anything, Patty?  Did you feel any tingly sensations?  You can be honest.  My butt was sore.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, my legs.  I had to take a hot shower because my legs were crampy.  I had to figure out how to put my feet so my legs don't cramp up. 
[00:37:00]  So the sore butt was from the motorcycle and not from anything that happened at the party?  No.  No?  Okay.  Just making sure.  You're still a virgin, technically?  You didn't have a big O on the motorcycle?  No.  Did you get a little something?  Did you get a little something?  Was it like, ooh, this is kind of interesting down there?  Yeah, I was too busy looking all around.  It's interesting riding outside than inside when you're in a car.  Oh, right.  Just kind of hanging out in the breeze. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, you just gave me a great idea.  Can we, like, strap you to a bumper and make the same trip?  Like a dead deer?  No.  No, Patty.  But you had fun.  That's not a good idea.  You're going to turn into a biker, bitch?  I'm a biker, bitch.  I would love to take another ride on a motorcycle.  It's so much fun.  I thought I'd be scared, and I wasn't.  No, huh?  No.  Well, you wait until you wreck once.  On the ride home, I was riding behind the bike she was on, and she was like one of those 
[00:38:00]  cicada bugs or something that you see, the way she was, like, holding on.  Just stunk.  Gripping on.  Thanks for having me, Patty.  I'm so glad you had fun.  I did.  And you had a lot of people there, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Are you going to meet everybody now tonight?  Are you going over to Hooters for the magazine signing party?  Yes, I am.  I brought all my magazines.  Anybody give you any phone numbers, any leads on any boyfriends, or anybody to take away 
[00:38:30]  that blessed virginity of yours?  No, just a couple people asked for my autograph over there, and that was it.  Hey, some guy called and said that you were, like, chewing his ear off about how you used  to work for TCBY down in Philly.  I didn't work for TCBY.  I worked for Willow Grip.  All I was trying to say was that I've been to the...  But was it really your job to cut up the bananas and to clean out the yogurt machines?  No, I had to manage the store over the weekend.  Didn't you just have to drive all the way out there, get all the way out there, however  the hell you did it, and clean out the yogurt machines? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I know how to take them apart.  Remember that?  Three years ago, she told us that was her job.  Great.  Too bad there wasn't some kind of industrial accident when you were doing that.  Virgin.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, Patty, thanks for coming by.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, see you later.  All right.  Back to your ant hole.  Go burrow.  Anthony? 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  We have an old friend that has stopped by.  Yeah.  He is completely healed.  And we're making good on our promise, and we're going to get him a lap dance today.  Yeah, I know he's here.  We're talking about Blind Dave.  I was just playing foosball with him.  I was.  The guy scored three times on me.  He spins every single handle, even mine, towards my goal.  Yeah.  So I'm trying to move the ball, and it's just going...  You scored three times on me. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, what's up?  Bastard.  No, Rick goes, hey, Blind Dave, come here, and you're waving your hand like, come here,  he can't see you.  Oh, man, but then I said, follow the sound of my voice.  He's waving his hand.  This way.  Hey, Dave, why are you wearing a shirt that says, I am gay?  Oh, he's wearing a wow shirt.  Don't tease a blind man.  Don't tease a blind man like that.  Oh, Dave, I'm sorry.  That was a low blow.  No, you have one of our wow shirts on. 
[00:40:30]  Pretty good game of foosball there, Dave.  You scored three times on me.  I handed out wow bumper stickers all over Boston before you guys even got on there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  To all the people at the blind place?  Yeah, all the blind drivers.  Cool.  When he was up seeing his chick.  Now, Dave, we need an update.  She's here, so she's in Connecticut, hopefully not listening.  All right, Dave, we need an update.  Okay.  How are your ribs, your spleen, your kidney? 
[00:41:00]  I'm in perfect health.  I want to dispel the rumors.  The oxygen tank has been removed.  He's doing a blind Don Ivins.  My mom's smoking the Marlboros quite well now.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Everything's okay.  And no spleen problems and kidneys, nothing like that.  Very good.  They sent me.  I had a puffed up thing in the front of my rib.  I just wanted more pain pills. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  They made me go to the doctor, and he's just like poking.  He's like, you know, that's not your ribs that's popping out.  And I'm like, you're a genius.  What was it?  They sent me for a cat scan.  It was my spleen.  He's like, we told you you're not supposed to move around.  Oh, man.  And apparently, like.  Your spleen was popping out between your ribs.  It was just like a puffy thing here, and I just, you know.  I'm getting all nauseous just thinking about it. 
[00:42:00]  Well, they said when you, one of the things that tightens, like, in your stomach muscle  areas and all that is doing the D.  Have you been doing anything strenuous with your stomach?  Oh, banging.  Banging your girl?  Yeah.  Man, if she's listening, I'm like so dead.  Makes your spleen get puffy.  Hey, we got some.  When it's been bruised.  Ah.  Let's play some clips from blind boxing.  Oh, come on.  It's embarrassing enough.  Nah, you did a good job. 
[00:42:30]  We should explain.  Blind Dave came in here.  Blind Matt took him on, and they had a real live boxing match.  They were boxing with all the gear.  The bell rang, and they came out swinging.  I'm sure there's a video clip still on foundrymusic.com, if you can find them.  Yeah.  Might be a tough search, but.  No, I'm serious, because there's so much stuff on there.  Yeah.  Maybe Steve could, you know, bring those clips back to the top of, you know, the front page  for a while.  But, yeah, you got beat pretty good by Blind Matt. 
[00:43:00]  They would just.  There was holding, though.  I gotta say, there was a lot of holding.  No, the holding was us trying to separate you guys.  That was the funniest part of this whole thing.  You guys had no clue when we were grabbing you guys to pull you apart.  You thought it was the other boxer, and you guys started swinging at all of us.  I fully, like you explained that, like so good.  But, you know, I don't want to bitch about it too much, but from what people told me is  that you could see in the pictures that he's holding on one side and hammering on the other. 
[00:43:30]  And there was a lot of holding, and there was in boxing if someone holds.  But I did think of something to take Blind Boxing to another level.  Yeah.  Which I will not be part of.  But, uh, Blind Kick Boxing.  Ugh.  Well, that would be pretty good.  You're insane.  All right.  Let's, uh, a little taste of Blind Boxing with Blind Dave and Blind Matt.  All right.  Ready for Blind Boxing.  When you guys hear, the bell will start.  I can't believe this.  Here we go.  They're facing each other in the corner. 
[00:44:00]  And, uh, let's get ready to Blind Rumble.  There they go.  Oh, my God.  They're right in front of each other, and they don't know it.  They have no clue where each other is.  Someone's going to get...  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Here they go.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're on the ring.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Matt, Matt knocked down, uh, Dave.  Matt knocked down Dave. 
[00:44:30]  Dave went down hard.  Did not show up if it was a push.  Did not show up if it was a push.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Back to neutral corners.  Dave, how are you feeling?  That hurt.  You hear Ben laughing like a lunatic in the background.  It was entertaining to watch.  The best was, yeah, we explained it, but they came out of their corners and had no idea they  were facing each other.  I mean, they were right in front of each other and had no clue.  Yeah.  No clue.  We have another clip from Blind Boxing with Dave and Matt. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Are we ready?  Let's resume the round.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  A little over a minute left in the round.  Here they go.  They're looking at each other.  Oh!  Matt connected with, Dave connected with the right.  Dave is now swinging.  Oh, wow.  All right.  They got him.  All right.  They're swinging like crazy.  This has gotten really real.  They're in a clinch now.  All right.  All right.  They're out of the ring.  All right.  They're out of the ring.  They're out of the ring.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  Break.  They're fighting after the bell. 
[00:45:30]  These two are out for blood.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rick is down.  Rick got punched in the face.  A lot of people got punched in the face.  Rick got punched in the face.  Time to break him up.  Hold on.  Talk to Dave.  What's he talking about?  Talk to Dave.  Dave, what's going on?  Dave.  I just got body blowed.  My ribs are killing me.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I hope your lawyer doesn't need that clip.  Dave, I got to tell you something.  I wish you got to tell people that he cracked three ribs doing this. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And there's the proof right there.  And Dave, you were notorious for swinging and kicking after the bell.  After everyone said break or something, you would get that last shot in.  I wasn't the only one.  You went down on your back and kicked and just missed Steve C from Foundry Music.  Well, then I heard that.  But one thing you have to remember, me and Matt had a little powwow on one of the breaks.  And one of the things was, hey, I heard them say break. 
[00:46:30]  And you're still hitting me, so I'm going to hit you back.  Let's next time when they say break, let's just break.  Right.  Just don't even.  Because we know we can both hear good.  Right.  And so that happened.  And I still was getting hit.  So, yeah, I got ticked off.  Oh, okay.  I was wondering about that.  But I never meant to hit Rick or to kick it Steve C.  No, that was the funny part.  Hitting Rick was great.  With the elbow over it.  Yeah, your elbow swung around, caught Rick in the chin, and knocked him out for a couple seconds. 
[00:47:00]  He was down.  He was on the floor.  Boom, like that.  I felt a little bad about that.  All right, we have one more clip from Blind Boxing.  It's Matt and Dave.  Let's go.  There they go.  They're back in.  Oh, running in.  Oh!  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  No, no, he's still going.  Okay, they're going to fight their way out of it.  Still going.  They're fighting.  Fighting out of it.  Wow.  Wow.  Break, break.  All right.  Wow.  The front.  Oh, my God. 
[00:47:30]  Break, break, break.  Break, break.  All right, they were out of the ring.  Holy.  Wow.  What a flurry of blows that was.  All right, listen.  I just got punched.  Blind Dave, work in the body.  I just got punched in the body.  I got a couple of shots.  Oh, God.  Opie got punched in the sack.  Sorry, Opie.  It's all right.  I don't care now.  That was a month ago.  Yeah.  Because they, they, it was scary because, you know, instead of going at each other, they  were just moving around the room, swinging like crazy, and that's what, you hear Ant  and I running away with our microphones and stuff. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, because we didn't know where they were punching.  No clue.  They wouldn't hit anyone.  Yeah, I know.  I, hey.  Blind boxing, very, very successful.  Next time, we got to have a rope, so if you ever do it again, you got to have ropes  to keep them, you know, that way the blind people fight and know.  Yeah, we'll up the ante.  But we're going to go on vacation soon.  We're going to replay that whole show because it was really, really good, but that's just  a little taste.  But we promised Dave and Matt that we would get them lap dances.  Yeah.  For participating in blind boxing. 
[00:48:30]  Mm-hmm.  So we got a bunch of ladies coming down, right, Rick?  Ladies are on the way about 15 minutes.  15 minutes away.  And blind Matt should be here in about 10 minutes.  And trust me, you're going to enjoy this lap dance, my friend.  I can see this being a whole, like, transvestite thing.  No, no, no.  We seriously are not going to try to pull any kind of gag on you.  We don't give our word often.  We give our word that that's not what this is about.  I'm checking for Adam's apples.  No, that's fine.  You've earned this. 
[00:49:00]  Believe me.  And if there are any ladies that want to help out with the lap dances, we're going to have  both Dave and Matt on the couch.  And, you know, the girls are pretty much just going to smother them for a while.  Well, you know, if you're in the area, come on down and help us out with that, okay?  Yes.  I thank you both very much.  All right.  Even though I probably am not going to be getting it with my girlfriend for a long time for this.  Oh, boy.  Can we get her on the line?  Smooth things over for you?  I don't know.  She's out with my sister somewhere.  Yeah.  Hey, Rich Voss.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, bro? 
[00:49:30]  The show's been on like an hour and 20 minutes, and Jay Moore hasn't called in to plug anything yet.  Rich Voss, who, of course, Jay Moore was on the show the other day.  I'm kind of giving you a hard time.  Yesterday, trashing you.  I heard.  I was playing golf.  You know, if he calls the show one more time, you can just call him Frida.  Hey, Rich.  What?  This is the blind guy.  I got something for you.  What's that?  I got very little vision left.  Yeah.  So I kind of look at it like my sight's kind of like Jay Moore's career.  It's there, but it's not that noticeable.  Thank you. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, wow.  Wow.  I thought you were like, ouch.  Sorry, Jay.  Just a joke.  No, it's not a joke.  It's true.  He stinks, okay?  No, he's pretty funny.  Listen to me.  He's delusional, all right?  Ed Wood turned him down.  That's what a bad actor he is.  Oh, but he's doing better than you.  Who is?  Blind Dave just said he's doing better than you, Rich.  Jay's not doing better.  They're coming out, actually.  Get in the coffin.  Die.  Do you know they're coming out with a new reality show with Jane Woodrow?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, eight comics go on stage, and he sits in the back of the room with whoever he doesn't steal from wins the prize. 
[00:50:30]  What?  I'm telling you, he stinks.  The only thing he should be plugging is his thinning hair on his enormous head.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Wow.  I'm upset.  All right.  Thank you.  Are you coming down to Hooters tonight?  I don't know.  I might.  We're going to have a party after the show.  A little magazine signing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Rich.  Let me go to Tom over here.  I saw you at Caroline's.  Tom? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  You're on the line with Rich Voss.  Who's this?  I saw you at Caroline's a couple Sundays ago.  Yeah.  With the French folk.  Remember that?  The French group?  The French people on the front row?  Yeah.  I just got to say, you absolutely sucked that night, man.  You're funny as hell on the show, but you absolutely sucked.  Wait.  You just said I was funny on the show.  Oh, I sucked that night at Caroline's?  You absolutely sucked that night.  Did you pay to get in?  Huh?  Did you pay to get in?  Absolutely.  Okay.  All that matters.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you, Tom.  Take it easy.  All right, Rich.  We'll see you at Hooters hopefully tonight, okay?  All right, man.  Thanks.  Right after the show.  All right, bye.  We're all going down.  All right, cool.  It's 56th Street between Broadway and 7th.  I know the struggle.  So we got the lap dances happening for Dave and Matt in a little while.  Do you guys just, like, hate all comedians or what?  All comedians hate all comedians.  It's just how it is.  And then when they see each other, it's like, ah, but, you know, I love this guy.  Right.  He's okay.  Right.  All right.  Except Norris. 
[00:52:00]  We got a replay to Dickie Betts' song from yesterday.  Uh-huh.  Great little song that Brother Joe came up with.  Dickie punching his wife in the face again.  Yep.  And as we take a quick break, Steve put together a little something about the Wow Summit from yesterday, okay?  Check it out.  August 15, 2001.  Opie and Anthony held the first annual Wow Summit.  Bikes, babes, and boobs on a goodwill mission to Philadelphia.  We're going down.  We're going down. 
[00:52:30]  We're going down.  We're going down.  I've seen a lot of fine women with big breasts.  I haven't been laid in a year and a half, and I needed that.  Can't wait until they come down.  We're ready for sex for sale.  O-A-N-A.  O-A-N-A.  Yeah, the summit was awesome.  They had some gorgeous New York girls.  They had the girl in the black leather, incredible.  And tattoo chick, incredible.  At first, it was like a little slow.  Like, they didn't know what was going to happen.  Then they just started, like, kept coming and kept coming and kept coming.  O-A-N-A.  Yeah, O-A-N-A is new to Philly, but they're taking over. 
[00:53:00]  O-A-N-A.  Hey.  No tampons.  That's all I got to say.  Wow.  Rocks.  Sex for Sam rocks.  That was great.  Driving up here, got a big W-O-W on the back of my trail.  All of it, man.

[00:54:30]  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW.  927 WNEW.  Waiting for blind Matt to show up.  Black dancers for blind guys today.  Can't win.  Hey, Rick, where are those pictures of the Mary-Kate and Ashley dolls?  Hold on, Rick, hold on. 
[00:55:00]  I can't find the buttons for all the mics.  Hold on.  There's so much crap on the board here.  What's up, Rick?  I gave him the Scott like it.  Rick Lott.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You haven't put them up on the site yet?  I don't know.  I haven't seen them.  Well, Anthony and Rick decide to shoot their own porno with the Mary-Kate and Ashley dolls.  There's dolls now.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dolls.  And someone was kind enough to give us them as a little gift today. 
[00:55:30]  So what was the first thing we do?  Rip them out of their packages and take their clothes off.  It even comes from a little camera.  Yeah.  One of those old-fashioned film cameras.  Yeah, because it's supposed to be this whole movie stage theme.  And we had their clothes off and had them with various doll faces buried in various doll parts.  Within seconds, you had their clothes off.  Oh, yeah.  It didn't take long.  It didn't take long.  Turned out to be a race between Anthony and Stinky. 
[00:56:00]  Who could get their doll naked first?  I had the Ashley doll because she's the goer.  As per Time Magazine.  Which you will not be signing tonight at Hooters.  I shan't sign Time Magazine.  You know what those dolls should come with?  They should come with a little man with a beard and a Hawaiian shirt and a little shallow grave.  A little 55-gallon drum.  A little grave and tears that come out.  You're insane, man. 
[00:56:30]  A little John Walsh.  You guys are insane.  Moving right along.  This scum has to be put behind bars.  Jennifer.  Hello?  Hey.  You're on the radio.  Hi.  What's up, Jennifer?  Not so much.  What's going on?  Talking to you.  I just wanted to call and tell you guys I had a great time yesterday. 
[00:57:00]  It was a lot of fun.  You went to the WOW Summit?  Yes.  And which one were you?  I was the one on the end with the white shirt with the big ones.  With the biggest ones on the stage?  I think so, yeah.  They're so big that your whole nip area is moving to the left?  A little bit, yeah.  On the left boob and moving to the right on the right boob?  Yeah, cut me some slack.  I'm 30.  No, there's no sagging going on.  It's just like you have so much breast meat in front that it's pushing everything to  the sides.  You got a lot of boobage.  Yeah, a little bit. 
[00:57:30]  They were monstrous.  So, nothing wrong with that.  I think your pictures are up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, are they up there?  I believe so.  I don't know if they got a shot of yours, but I'm looking right now.  What were you wearing?  A pair of khaki pants and just like a white t-shirt.  Yeah, yeah, that's you.  Let me see.  That's all right.  Wow.  Yeah, they are.  Oh, Anthony was making fun of your boobs.  I was.  I was not.  I do.  That is not nice.  I think I need to go back to the tape, but I think what Anthony said is one of the veins 
[00:58:00]  on your boob is as large as an aorta.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Perhaps a superior viticaba.  You're going to be in the goer.  You just ruined it.  Blind Dave can shoot heroin into that thing.  Oh.  Wow.  I never thought you guys were going to be mean.  No, it's not mean.  We like breasts like that.  Jennifer.  Yes.  I love your boobs.  Okay.  Wonderful.  Thank you.  See, you don't really know the show yet.  This is endearing what we do.  Yeah.  Okay.  We make fun of everyone and everything. 
[00:58:30]  We just go with it.  They're big boobs, but you got one big vein there.  Yeah.  Well.  If they ever have to take a vein and put it somewhere else, they know where to go.  That boob would be good for a femur.  What if your carver breaks down and you can just take it out and tow it with that?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's a big one.  Well, actually, I have a really funny story.  The girl that was standing next to me is actually somebody I used to work with.  The girl standing next to you. 
[00:59:00]  That is hilarious.  With the little ones in the black shirt.  Wow, how can we make that into 13 episodes and sell it to a network?  You have a great rank, but that story stunk.  All right, Jennifer.  Good story.  Thank you.  We're all laughing all over the place for that.  All right.  Bye.  Good.  All right.  Bye.  Here's a new rule of thumb.  When anybody says, I have a really funny story, they don't.  She's hot, though.  Hey, where's the Dickie Betts song?  Dickie Betts.  Isn't that something? 
[00:59:30]  And we are taking advice from one of the listeners earlier that called.  We'd never got to him, but he said we should use Dickie Betts as a verb now.  Like, oh, he was giving her the Dickie Betts, you know?  Giving her the business.  Giving her the Dickie Betts.  Had a Nussbaum.  Got the Dickie Betts years ago.  Oh.  Remember, Had a...  Joel Steinberg.  Joel Steinberg.  Chain that little brat to the radiator.  Yeah.  He's a classic.  And then Had a Nussbaum.  That was years ago, here in New York. 
[01:00:00]  There was this woman, Had a Nussbaum, and Joel Steinberg was his name.  And the kid.  Little Lisa.  Was it?  Yeah.  I believe so.  Lisa Steinberg.  Lisa Steinberg.  And this Joel Steinberg would beat the living crap at a Had a Nussbaum where she, her face,  was pummeled.  They had her on the front page all the papers years ago.  And then they gave her the makeover.  Remember the Had a Nussbaum makeover?  I mean, the city embraced this woman.  This dopey-ass woman who didn't know how to leave.  Just walk away. 
[01:00:30]  Just take the vehicles and walk away.  She never left.  And her face looked like, well, like Joel Steinberg had been punching her for about five years.  Well, you never know.  Was she talking when the game was on?  I mean, they really never gave an explanation.  But, uh, yeah, that would be considered the Dickie Betts.  The Dickie Betts.  Yeah.  The story hit the other day that Dickie punched his wife again while they were driving this  time, right?  Yes.  It's scary to think that he's driving a car.  Well, no, she was driving. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, she was driving him?  Yeah.  And then he turns around and...  Hey, punch the driver.  That's nuts.  You don't punch the driver.  How hot is this girl in Sports Illustrated?  Uh, beyond hot?  Yeah, she's 13.  Wait, who is that?  That girl's 13?  Yeah.  Who is that?  Get over here.  Um, she's on Paige.  No way.  Look at how hot she is.  I don't feel bad, because half the models in, like, Cosmopolitan and all that are all underage.  Look at your little hiney bubble.  A hiney bubble.  What are you doing to copy a best sign for kids?  Wow, she's got, uh... 
[01:01:30]  Look at her back muscles, let me see.  She's a rock climber.  She does some pole vaulting.  That girl really is 13.  Yeah, but it's a top...  The photograph is taken like it's above her.  Yeah, can't you tell from this big ball?  The one with the little, yeah, Mickey Mouse dolls and stuff, sure.  Flying little teddy bears.  That's not the one I was looking at.  Nice.  That's good.  She's a rock climber, so that handy would be like...  Yeah.  You have to be careful where you keep her, though, because she can climb out.  Oh, man, she totally looks 13 when you look at it close up. 
[01:02:00]  All right, so, uh, Brother Joe came up with a Dickie Betts song, Anthony.  And here it is.  Yes.  Oh, I assaulted you again  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head  When it's time for your beating  You take it like a man  Yeah, I assaulted you again 
[01:02:30]  I warned you once  And you just kept on bitching  I stomped my cowboy boot down on your toes  But you still didn't get the message  You effing slut  So I had to break your nose  Oh, I assaulted you again 
[01:03:00]  Hitting and kicking and punching you in the head  When it's time for your beating  You take it like a man  Yeah, I assaulted you again  Oh, I assaulted you again  Oh, I assaulted you again 
[01:03:30]  Hurry up there, Goxie  And there you have it, Brother Joe.  Is Brother Joe coming in tonight?  Call it the Lycus. 
[01:04:00]  Come on.  Tim, what's going on?  Guys, listen, I have it on good authority that he didn't assault,  but he was just signaling a left-hand turn.  From the passenger side.  From the passenger side of the video, left turn, Clyde.  What the hell is wrong with you?  She got in the way.  Turn left.  Take care, guys.  All right.  What's up, Bundy?  Thank you.  Okay.  What?  Let us.  They don't have no hair. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, the Mary Kay and Ashley dolls.  Aren't they nice?  Thank you, Jim, by the way, for getting the Road Warrior reference.  All right.  Hey, we've got to play the hissing cockroach clips.  Yeah.  From the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Right.  Which we did.  Wow.  How long ago was that?  So much has happened.  That was last summer.  Was it last summer?  Yeah.  About a year ago?  Yeah, we blew it off this year.  It should have been the second annual 55-gallon drum challenge.  We might have to.  We might do it.  We might have to do that very soon. 
[01:05:00]  But it's such a fun thing.  We took a bunch of girls, and as per many serial killers, we threw them in 55-gallon drums,  sealed up the top, cut a hole in it, and dumped in just horrifying stuff on top of them.  Everything from just simple cold water to shock them, from the cold, all the way up to hissing cockroaches.  Fish guts.  Fish guts.  Squid.  Some of it was chum, scary. 
[01:05:30]  Some was disgusting chum.  It was really bad.  And then the worst was we threw in kitty litter, and dust started building up inside.  And then all we heard was these 55-gallon drum echoes of hacking girls.  Help me.  We had, what, seven girls in the studio?  Yeah.  About?  It was a mess.  It sounded like the pit in Silence of the Lambs.  Yeah.  When that girl was in the pit.  Stop, help me.  My mother won't pay you.  Yeah.  It was just like that. 
[01:06:00]  Oh.  We bring it up because the latest issue of FHM Magazine with Anna Kornikova on the cover.  Yeah.  There's a one-page article on you and I, Ant.  And I'm surprised we answered this question the way we did.  It says, what's been the most ridiculous moment in O&A history?  Ridiculous.  And Anthony says, the 55-gallon drum challenge was great.  We put a bunch of girls in 55-gallon drums, sealed the tops, and threw a hole, started throwing stuff on them.  The last one remaining in her barrel would win the prize. 
[01:06:30]  We threw everything from ice-cold water at first to disgusting food products, syrup, fish guts, worms, and then at the end, African hissing cockroaches.  The screams that came out of the barrels translated really well over the air.  It sounded like a storeroom at a serial killer's house.  Yeah.  You got the echo of the barrel and the horrifying screams of these girls and us laughing in the background.  It was really sick and twisted.  You know, it was one of the sickest things of that day, and it was visual, unfortunately.  We looked at one of the barrels, and we had cut a hole in the side just so we can see the girl a little bit. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  It was a little, maybe, two-inch diameter hole.  And at one point, just an eye.  It was a girl's eye peering out, just looking sad and scared and hurt.  How nice would it have been to stick a tack in that?  It was really awful.  You know, Ben found the pictures from the...  Oh, there they are.  Ben, where are you at?  OpieandAnthony.com?  OpieandAnthony.com.  We have the pictures up.  And we do have a shot of just the girl's eyes sticking out of the barrel there, so... 
[01:07:30]  Go to the Wall of Fame.  Go to the Wall of Fame section?  All right.  Hall of Fame.  Hall of Fame, whatever?  Okay.  Well, we have a couple clips from that fateful day, Anthony, the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yeah.  How many clips we got?  We got three.  All right.  Well, which one is this?  You want to do Hissing Cockroaches first?  That's the grand finale, because that was just too insane.  Let's do...  This pretty much starts off.  All right.  This is just the start of the 55-gallon drum challenge, Anthony. 
[01:08:00]  Here we go.  All right.  We're going to start the pouring festivities.  Okay.  We're going to start, I guess, like I could start any party.  With a couple of beers.  Okay.  All right.  Some Budweiser?  That's a waste of a mighty fine beer, Anthony.  I'm not talking about pouring it.  Oh.  I'm drinking it.  Okay.  All right.  Are you willing, if you really have to go to the bathroom, to just go in there?  I don't think so.  No?  No. 
[01:08:30]  I'm fine, so I'm all right.  Are you okay?  I'm all right, yeah.  Yeah?  I've got a lot of...  What did she say?  I just poured the beer on her head while she was talking.  Notice I started with Wendy.  How you doing, Wendy?  Well, it's good for the hair.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, let's start dumping stuff in there.  Okay.  Let's go.  All right.  Hey, Christy.  How you doing?  Woo-hoo!  Here, mic the girls as they're getting stuff dumped in. 
[01:09:00]  Here's good.  Wow!  All right, there you go.  A little bit of beer on Christy.  How have we gone?  Hey, Cade.  How you doing?  Be kind.  Be kind?  How's that?  Goddamn, this is fun.  They're trying to avoid the stuff, Anthony.  There's a point in there.  I completely forgot there was one girl that was so fat, we couldn't fit her. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, we could not fit her in a 55-gallon drum.  So, what we did was we took two big of those landscaper green, big garbage pail things you  see in the back of the landscaper's trucks, two of them, put them on top of each other  and duct taped it shut.  And she was in that.  Yeah.  Because we didn't want to discriminate.  No. 
[01:10:00]  Against the fatties.  And then finally she fell over in it and all the stuff leaked out on the floor.  She just fell over.  Hey, Jim, you remember that, huh?  Oh, my God.  That was the worst thing you tried shoving in those barrels was her.  Yeah.  Man, it broke apart, matter of fact.  Remember?  Yes.  Oh, there she is.  She was disqualified.  What was she?  She was about 300 pounds or better than that.  I don't know.  She was a big girl, yeah.  I'm looking at her picture.  I'm going landscaping garbage can Mexicans were afraid of, for Christ's sake.  There you go.  And it's checking out the picture right now on opieandanthony.com. 
[01:10:30]  You know how many pictures we have of the 55-gallon drum challenge?  170 pictures.  170, huh?  To go through.  This girl is a monstrosity.  Oh, yeah.  Awful.  Meal worms.  I'm looking at some of the stuff we put in.  Oh, there was the chum.  A big spackle bucket full of chum that they had a big chum stick, and they were just dumping  it on these girls.  Fish guts, fish blood, eyes.  Don't forget, my friend, it was the worst smell any of us have ever smelled in our lives.  Remember?  Well, what about that girl you had sex with in upstate New York and had to drive home 
[01:11:00]  with your hand out the window?  Yeah, worse for 300 miles.  55-gallon drum challenge, worse.  Not worse than what I had on my fingers when they were hanging out the window.  And I can only imagine what that was.  Butterscotch pudding.  Oh, the pudding, right.  Butterscotch pudding.  All right.  Ben is saying we've got to take a break before we play the other two clips, including finally  the hissing cockroach clip, which is great.  The screams of horror, sheer terror.  A girl might scream and just go, ah, and that's one thing. 
[01:11:30]  This was that horror scream.  Great.  Very authentic.  Also, I just want to remind you guys, remind me to talk about Dwarf Apalooza.  Dwarf Apalooza.  Coming to the O&A show.  All right.  Why not?  Dwarf Apalooza.  I could just say really fast.  We're going to set a day in the very near future, maybe like mid-September when we get  back from vacation.  Yeah.  And we're going to have a day just dedicated to dwarfs. 
[01:12:00]  And we're going to have a dwarf party in the studio.  Dwarfs of all kinds.  We want the biggest variety of dwarfs ever.  So we're going to be looking for like business dwarf, gay dwarf, black dwarf, Asian dwarf, slut  dwarf.  Dwarf, over six foot tall dwarf, fat dwarf, yeah, fat dwarf, handicapped dwarf, oh, yeah.  If that's not the grand slam.  Isn't that?  And our goal is to get as many different kinds of dwarfs possible and have a little party. 
[01:12:30]  Slut dwarf.  How hot is that?  Oh, wait.  It isn't at all.  Lesbian dwarfs?  Yeah.  So we're looking for all sorts of dwarfs.  And if you want in on our dwarf day, please give us a call.  It's going to take some time to get everyone together for this little party.  This little shindig.  We're going to have a lot of fun with that.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  The hissing cockroach is next. 
[01:13:00]  We've got to go to the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, this is Shane in Manhattan.  I'd like to send a big FU out to a guy I work with, Jimmy Oates.  I don't know what the hell this guy eats at home, but when he comes to work, man, it's  a nonstop barrage of cheese cutting.  And I'm talking nasty old man air bombs that buckle your knees and tear up the eyes.  I've had enough, damn it.  So FU, Jimmy.  Next message.  Hey, this is Paul from Corian, PA.  I want to just give a big FU out to Eric Lindros because he's such a mama's boy. 
[01:13:30]  Hey, Eric, if you cut the embolical cord, maybe you'll be able to do something with your  goddamn career.  Thanks a lot.  Bye.  Next message.  I want to send an FU out to Jay Moore.  Thanks for calling me the Asian man group.  You've been calling me for the rest of my life.  Thanks a lot, Jay.  Next message.  Hey, this is Jay from Jersey.  I'm just giving an FU out to my ex-girlfriend.  I'm in the angry stage of grieving.  Just FU.  End of message. 
[01:14:00]  Hey, Anthony, rat race.  Rat race.  Paramount Pictures and Fireworks Pictures presents Rat Race in theaters tomorrow, August 17th.  All right, I got to tell you something.  The previews look absolutely stupid, but the more and more I look into this movie, people  are saying it's really, really funny.  Really?  Yes.  Movie takes place in Las Vegas where a rich tycoon and a bunch of rich friends pit six  unsuspecting teams against each other to race for millions of dollars hidden somewhere  across America.  It's like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  It's the gambling experience of a lifetime.  Six teams stop at nothing to win, lie, cheat, steal, play dirty for this mad dash for cash.  Here's some of the huge stars in the movie.  Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, the little midget,  the little fidget Seth Green that we saw on those streets of New York.  The guy's like five foot tall.  It's amazing how short he is in real life.  And, of course, it's directed by Jerry Zucker.  Airplane, Naked Gun, you know the movies.  Opens everywhere tomorrow, August 17th. 
[01:15:00]  Hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is  This Station, 1027 WNEW.  Wow, cool.  We're back with the O&A show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Lots going on.  We got the girls from Privilege Gentleman's Club. 
[01:15:30]  They're outside the studio.  They're going to be giving the blind guys their lap dances.  Yeah.  Dave and Matt for doing the blind boxing for us.  This is what we're giving them in return.  Making good on our promise.  People really digging the dwarf.  You can't even say it.  Dwarf-a-palooza.  Dwarf-a-palooza idea.  Dwarf-a-palooza.  Someone suggested we need a teen dwarf as well.  Yes.  Okay, sure, teen dwarf.  I'm just waiting for the first dwarf or midget or little person to come forward and say, 
[01:16:00]  Hey, I want to be part of the party.  I have to ask, can we please get one and smother it?  Jim, I don't think we can.  No matter how much everyone would want to.  Jim, you're going to scare the dwarfs away.  I know the dwarf struggle.  I'm only kidding.  I want to smother a dwarf.  Speaking of which, we'll get a dwarf hack karmic as well. 
[01:16:30]  Oh!  Yeah, we could use Bob.  Oh.  Jeremy, what's up?  Jeremy.  Hey, what's up?  Sacramento checking in.  What's up?  Yeah, you guys are catching on out here.  I've already seen four wow signs out here.  In Sacramento?  Yeah.  Nice.  Well, we're going to have to do something for Sacramento.  Yeah, you guys need to come out or send somebody out here.  I mean, my buddy Pocus just got me listening to you guys probably about a week, two weeks ago.  Oh, that's it?  You guys are freaking hilarious. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, thank you, bro.  Missed some stuff.  As soon as we feel a buzz in a city, we'll do something.  Like, that's why we did the Wow Summit for Philly yesterday.  I have a feeling...  Yeah, how did that turn out?  It was unbelievable.  Pictures up on opianthony.com.  I have a feeling we're going to be going to Cleveland very soon, Boston without a doubt, and maybe Sacramento.  Word.  Even feeling a lot of love from D.C.  Yeah, I was listening for a little while yesterday before I got off work, and it sounded like it was off the charts.  So, you guys got to come out here, dude.  Yeah, we'll make it out there, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Yeah, later, guys. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  It's still way too early, though.  We're slowly but surely finding our audience in these cities.  Would you bring the Olsen Twins dolls in?  Oh.  Look at the hell.  You got them in the numbered position.  Tinkle not included.  And that's something.  Look at that.  I guess you could tell the difference between the two.  They have one smiling with their teeth showing, and then the other one.  Feel the hair.  Yeah, feel the hair.  Yeah, it looks like it's had some banana juice sprayed in it. 
[01:18:00]  You know who their hair looks like?  You ever see the Born on the Fourth of July, the lady that played Tom Cruise's mother?  What reference?  That's a good reference if you've seen it.  Hey, Pat, what's up?  Pat.  Pat suggests that we have the Little Kings play for Dwarf-O-Palooza.  Yeah.  There you go.  We got our band.  And they're also in FHM.  Huh?  They're also in the issue of FHM.  Oh, with Anna Kornikova.  Doug from Springfield.  What's going on?  What's up, guys? 
[01:18:30]  You got your ex-posed to be Radio Dwarf.  Boys.  Boys.  Boogie guy.  Brucey Mittman will be the Radio Dwarf.  Radio Dwarf.  Radio Dwarf, yes.  But I yield an iron fist as I climb the ladder into my SUV.  Yeah, you guys chill out with the Dwarf stuff, though, because we want these Dwarfs to come  forward in the midgets and the little people.  You'll be treated with dignity.  Well, we did.  The boxing guys were treated with dignity.  Absolutely.  They had a great time.  They enjoyed themselves.  Should we include a retarded Dwarf? 
[01:19:00]  Yes.  Oh, God.  All right.  We want Down Syndrome Dwarf?  Mongoloid Dwarf.  Down Syndrome Dwarf.  We'll take any type of Dwarf.  That's okay.  Big tongue and all.  Bring it down.  And for charity, you charge people 50 bucks to throw rocks at them.  No one's coming forward now.  No.  No.  Just the retarded one, Opie.  You're ruining my idea.  No one's coming forward.  No.  Everybody.  Listen.  Who the hell's going to call now and say, hey, I'll volunteer for this mess?  Dwarfs, little people.  It's the little people, Jerry. 
[01:19:30]  You know the little people.  They have a sense of humor and they understand this show.  We know you guys like alcohol.  We got plenty here.  So, of course, we're going to, you know.  When you look in that mirror every day and see you three feet tall, you know, you got  a sense of humor.  Yeah.  And everybody that's come in here has said it's cool.  It's a lot of fun.  And I really thought it was going to be awful.  And I had fun.  You always hear that stuff.  Well, no dwarfs are calling. 
[01:20:00]  Where are the dwarfs?  We need someone to call and say, all right, I volunteer.  And then we got party on.  They're probably asking tall people to hand them the phone.  Oh, maybe it's taking longer.  Jesus.  They're not showing up now.  Sure they will, Opie.  Johnny Race, rock and roll.  Hey, man.  You got to get the kiss dwarfs going.  We can get the kiss dwarfs.  Kiss dwarfs.  Remember them?  They don't like being called dwarfs, though.  What are they?  They kind of got mad at us.  But they are dwarfs.  They're little people.  Little persons.  Little fidgets.  That's what their business card says, man.  No, they like dwarfs. 
[01:20:30]  They don't like midgets.  Midgets is insulting.  Them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  So they like midgets.  Yeah.  They're called midgets.  No, they don't like.  Go the way, baby.  What are they like being called?  Dwarfs.  Or little people.  It's dwarfs.  They have the business card.  All right, cool.  Remember that one?  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll Johnny Race.  There you go.  Da-da.  Da-da.  Remember that little rascal?  Da-da.  Da-da.  Them's not.  Them ain't babies.  Them's fidgets.  And then the one turned around and goes, ah, go chase yourself. 
[01:21:00]  Remember that?  He finally talked, the little one.  And they used to make the old ladies jump up and down and then check under their dress  for any jewelry that they dropped.  Ah, go chase yourself.  Meet on the instant feedback, Anthony.  Yeah.  How about the Abercrombie and Fitch midget?  Very good idea, sir.  That's a good one, too.  He could smash gold records around his office when he gets pissed.  Someone call Steve at K-Rock.  We want him for our party.  No one's calling.  God.  I think we scared everyone away. 
[01:21:30]  Crazy A.  It's got to be dwarfs.  Crazy A.  Crazy Yid.  Crazy what?  Crazy Yid.  Crazy Yid.  Jew.  All right.  Crazy Yid.  I might be able to get in some gefilte-fasiling Hasidic little dwarf.  A Hasidic dwarf?  We'll take a Hasidic dwarf.  That would rock.  I will bet you all the money in the world you can't get us in.  Does he trip over his own payas as he walks?  That would be interesting.  I know.  I've got to see if I can get him to come in.  And he's got the curly fries and everything on the side of his head? 
[01:22:00]  He's got the curly fries, but he's got them.  The curly fries on the side of his head.  Have him call the show or whatever.  We would love to have him.  If I can get him, you got him.  Sir, does he wear a little tiny hat and a little black jacket at all times?  I hung up on him by accident.  I'm sorry.  The little hat.  Maybe he wears a long one and he stands on another one's shoulders and tries to get into the adult place.  I have a feeling this is another one of our ideas that will never see the light of day.  Damn it.  I'm going to be really pissed off.  Oh, wait.  We're going to have to put it in the same category as Feels for Meals and all those other fun. 
[01:22:30]  No, O.P.  As we came up with what can do.  I will point you now to line nine.  Line nine?  Tank.  Tank.  Hey, Tank.  Hi.  What's up, Tank?  You said you got vodka there, I'll be there.  Oh, this old gag.  So you got what?  Vodka.  He's talking about Hank.  Yeah, I'll be there.  From my Howard show.  Don't worry about it.  That's one word.  All right.  We're serious.  He's making a joke.  We just want a cavalcade of assorted dwarfs down here. 
[01:23:00]  Right.  And, yeah, I'm starting to get a little nervous that we're not going to get any.  Well, spread the word.  Help us out, okay?  If you know any dwarfs.  We broadcast areas now that have bad water so we can find them.  Is that what does it?  Water.  Is that what does it, the water?  A little mercury.  Do you see many in the middle of Manhattan?  No.  You got to be on the sticks.  That's where all the cool birth defects went. 
[01:23:30]  Oh.  Oh.  You got to.  Oh.  So you're saying you got to go into the country to find the cool birth defects now?  I think, you know, bad water equals dwarfs.  Besides dwarfs, what else would you consider a cool birth defect, Opie, since you opened up this can of worms?  Anthony, hey.  Thalidomide?  You like the little flipper hands?  Hot.  Or the wrist that ends and just has three little nubs that looked like they were going to grow into fingers?  All right.  You challenged me. 
[01:24:00]  I'll tell you another cool birth defect.  What?  Lobster hands.  Oh, the claw hands.  Lobster boy.  Those are cool.  They look like claws.  I like that.  That's a cool defect.  And their feet look the same.  How about pinheads?  Pinheads?  They're kind of cool.  Yeah, they're a little wacky looking.  John, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  What's up?  I'll come down here.  I'm a little person.  So there's nothing up then. 
[01:24:30]  All the bad jokes now.  John, are you a little person really?  Yeah, I'm a little person.  Are you a dwarf little person or just a little person?  I'm a dwarf, yes.  And how could you prove that?  I'll come down there, man.  Hey, someone call Wee Man from Jackass.  That's a great idea.  Wee Man.  John, I'm serious.  We're going to show you guys a great time.  All kidding aside, we want to fill the studio with a lot of little people and have you running  around like little whatever and then we're going to have some fun. 
[01:25:00]  What do you mean like a little whatever?  What are we going to be doing?  Drinking and it depends.  We're going to like...  What category would you consider yourself?  As far as what?  Are you a gay little person?  Are you an athlete little person?  Are you a black little person?  I'm a regular Caucasian Irish little person.  Oh, the drunk little person.  Okay.  Yeah.  Notre Dame.  I'm no stranger to the booze, you know.  So you like the alcohol.  Anything else?  Chicks. 
[01:25:30]  Well, you're not standing out, but he is a dwarf.  All right.  What day do you want me to come down?  You'll be the Irish dwarf.  There you go.  We got our first one for the party.  All right.  Hold on.  All right?  Hold on.  I'd like to come down for the dwarf thing.  Why do you hang up?  Because he was lying.  Oh.  But I'd really like to come down.  Can I do it?  Sure.  Dwarf?  Yeah.  What kind of dwarf are you?  Celebrity dwarf.  Dwarf.  Just make sure you see my new movie. 
[01:26:00]  It's Seth Green.  How you doing?  Hi.  Celebrity dwarf.  Do I fit or am I too short?  Wow.  Poor Seth.  I will never get him on this.  You know, what did you say, Opie?  What did you say when he walked down the street?  I went, wow, there goes Seth Green.  I go, god damn it, he's short.  And then Opie goes, that's Seth Green?  He goes, I thought it was a little kid that looked like Seth Green.  He is really, really short.  Wow. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  You know what's a really cool birth defect?  I don't know if it's a defect.  It's those little kids that have that old person disease.  Oh.  That is pretty.  So uncool.  How many people are you going to piss off, Opie?  Three?  Yeah.  It's not like you see this all over the place.  But that disease made a huge, it became huge when, like, Jerry Springer would have them  on and Phil Donahue even.  And all of a sudden they'd have these little kids going, well, I just want to go to Disney.  This is going to be great.  Great.  I started getting this, but I live a normal life. 
[01:27:00]  No, you don't.  Everyone's looking at you going, 80-year-old and granimals.  It's an embarrassment.  Isn't that horrible?  Just stay in the house.  What happens then?  Is it the mom smoking or something or drinking?  They find out what causes that one?  Oof.  Ah, Bart, what's up?  Yeah, Opie.  Yeah.  You got a good lobster claw hand story.  Yeah.  You just mentioned it?  Yeah.  Back in high school, we used to have a goalie with two fingers.  He had a lobster hand.  Uh-huh.  He had a glove hand.  We used to shoot slap shots. 
[01:27:30]  I thought I'd have knocked a glove off his hand.  You might be able to get him down there and play a little street hockey.  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right.  Thank you, Mark.  All right.  Beat it.  All right.  Let me go to Bill real fast.  Bill, what's up?  Hello, guys.  How are you?  Good, Bill.  I'm a small person.  You are?  Yep.  Okay.  26.  Uh-huh.  And I'm pretty average.  I drink a lot, but other than that.  What category would you fall into?  Because we want all different kinds.  Uh, I party pretty good. 
[01:28:00]  Like I said, drink.  Don't do any drugs.  Boy, they all like drinking.  Like, what do you do for a living?  Uh, I work.  I'm an advertising rep.  All right.  So, you could be, like, business dwarf.  Sure.  I got little business suits and everything.  Do you have any hobbies?  Uh, yeah.  I fly little helicopters.  Real little helicopters.  Fly little helicopters.  Those are rubber bands, sir.  What?  What, you fly real helicopters? 
[01:28:30]  No.  Little model helicopters.  Oh.  Radio control helicopters.  Real helicopters.  I thought maybe you'd put some phone books on the seat.  So, what are we going to do?  When are we going to come down?  Huh?  When are we going to come down?  Uh, we're trying to get it together.  We need some more people to come forward.  I'm telling you the truth.  We'll show you a great time.  Great time.  Hey, guys, if you'd like, I drive a Suburban.  You've got to see that.  No.  I'm four foot four.  I drive a Suburban.  Wow.  Can you send a picture of that?  It's Brucey Mittman.  Uh, yeah.  We're going to send it to you guys.  It is.  It's Brucey Mittman.  Hold on a line, okay? 
[01:29:00]  All right.  This guy will definitely come down.  All right.  Bill will come down.  Get his info, all right?  What do you want, buddy?  Boys.  Jamie Lynn Siegler.  Yeah.  Hey.  How are you?  Jamie Lynn.  Oh, my God.  Metal Soprano.  Let's just...  Thank you, Rick.  Thank you for handing me this.  What do you think, Jamie Lynn, Rick just handed us?  What?  What do you think, Rick just handed us all? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, gee, I don't know.  Jamie Lynn.  It's a magazine.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  It is the latest issue of Maxim Magazine.  Yes.  And look who's on the cover.  Who?  It's you.  Metal Soprano.  All hot and stuff.  With your little gun panties on.  Those are cute, right?  Those are really cute.  And then I like the other one.  Where is that?  Hold on.  Well, can we just flat out tell her how amazing she looks in this spread? 
[01:30:00]  Thank you.  The gold bikini.  Nice.  Where you got your own hand down the front of your bikini a little bit?  Oh, my God.  Well, let's...  Why don't we start from the beginning, Ann?  Let's start with the cover.  As she's pulling at her top.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you're kind of bunching up your top right in your cleavage there.  Uh-huh.  And you're showing your belly, and now you're touching yourself with your other hand down  on the panties.  Oh. 
[01:30:30]  How sick is this, Jamie?  And you have kind of the F me look on the cover.  Yeah.  Which is very nice.  Yeah, I don't know how they casted that one.  Yeah.  What were you thinking?  I don't know.  That whole thing was kind of a blur for me.  Yeah?  It's fun.  I mean, it's...  Can they slip your roofies at Maxim's?  They might have.  I don't know.  No, I mean, it's fun.  I mean, those photoshoots, you know, they make you feel sexy and very feminine and everything.  So, they're good.  Yeah.  I got to stop you.  You are sexy. 
[01:31:00]  Thank you.  No, it's unbelievable.  The pictures came out great.  Thank you.  Let's go to the picture of her on the couch, Annie.  Yes, the first one.  And it's you.  Once again, trying to pull the panties down a little.  Well, the bottom.  She has her thumb tucked in.  Right in the hip of the panties.  And the other one's up over your head as you're laying down on the couch with the little jacket thing you're wearing off the shoulder.  Little white bra top thing.  Oh, wow.  Did you pick out these clothes?  Yes, I have Richard's clothing. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  And they, I mean, of course, they have some say in it.  Are these your personal clothes?  No.  I got to keep a gun panties.  They gave me those.  Oh, yeah?  None of it's mine.  No.  Hey, can we auction those off on our show?  Not my pair.  I'm keeping mine.  Hey, are these your F-Me boots?  No.  Oh.  I like them, though.  Yeah, they should have gave those to you.  I know.  Oh, well.  All right, let's move on, Anthony.  All right, let's go to the next picture, Jamie. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  There's the picture of you hanging on the pipes.  Yes.  As you're sitting on an old stool, you got a nice little dress on.  And the left foot a little high, which is showing what's underneath the dress there.  Yeah, I think I'm seeing panties.  I don't know what that is.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Oh, we know what that is.  Oh, that is the pleasure zone right there, Jamie Lynn.  Because the dress is being hiked up, and a beautiful gam is showing. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  You got nice legs.  Solid.  Solid.  And then the next one is kind of like the...  No, slow down, Opie.  Slow down.  You're still on that one.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, Jamie, I've been working with these guys.  What's up, Rick?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Jamie, I've been working for these guys for three years.  I've never seen them both frothing at the mouth quite the same at the same time.  Yeah, this is great.  We always thought you were beautiful, and to see these sexy poses.  Man.  We were waiting so long for you to take some clothes off.  For God's sake, us and the rest of America. 
[01:33:00]  It says, Ant, I have no problem showing my body.  I have faith in God, and this is what God gave me.  Oof.  That's so hot.  Isn't that what God's all about?  Guys just looking at your pictures going, oh.  Oh.  Well, you know, those interviews, they have, you know, you'll say something, and then they'll  cut out, like, three sentences in between and morph it together.  Oh, you did.  It sounds like you're saying things.  Oh, you don't have to tell us.  Have you seen our latest interview in FHM Magazine? 
[01:33:30]  No, I have not.  Oh, Jamie Lynn, you did an interview, too?  You know?  Here.  I was just looking at the picture.  The next shot is Jamie Lynn with a black...  A little black leather bikini top.  Bikini top on.  Yes.  Very nice.  Kind of coming out of the bottom of one of them.  Looks like.  A little bit.  I don't know.  I'm not looking at it right now.  And the face, really good, man.  You got that look on.  Who did your makeup?  I don't know. 
[01:34:00]  Someone there?  Some gay guy?  No, it was a woman.  It was a woman?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I like that.  I like the black under the eyes like that, too.  That's good.  It's good.  I don't know.  I think I have too much makeup on.  No, you know what that is?  No, no, no.  After a heavy night of just really banging, and then the next morning, you wake up, and  the girl's makeup is kind of coming down her face a little bit.  Yeah.  It's a slut look.  I like that.  Well, I guess that's why they did it that way.  Yeah.  But I like to think of you as an innocent girl, so...  Well, that's really what I am. 
[01:34:30]  The makeup's not all smeared or nothing.  I like the innocent types.  That's why.  And then the face shot is great.  What do your parents think of the shots?  Yeah.  My mom loved it.  Yeah?  My dad didn't say much.  Uh-huh.  As I don't expect him to.  That's okay.  You think he's pissed off?  He's not pissed off.  I mean, he knew I was doing...  I mean, he's known for a while.  I did this back in May, so...  It's got to be uncomfortable.  All his friends were probably checking out the pictures, you know? 
[01:35:00]  My dad's friend?  Yeah.  That's kind of nasty.  You didn't find a copy of this in the bathroom, did you?  What?  That's Jim Norton.  He said you didn't find a copy of this in the bathroom, did you?  Not my bathroom.  No.  My mom put it on the coffee table on her.  Oh, yeah?  Well, that's good.  My mom's proud.  Well, she should be.  Thanks.  It's unbelievable.  Do you get any calls or anything here from anybody?  From a lot of my friends, yeah.  My guy friends call me.  I bet.  Yeah.  I bet they do.  Do they sound tired? 
[01:35:30]  What?  No, they don't sound tired.  Any cast members call you?  No.  No?  They all knew, though.  Jackie Jr. didn't call you?  I know.  I haven't spoken to him yet.  I think he's...  No.  He didn't call me.  Yeah.  You think he's what?  No.  You run the interview.  Yeah.  I think he has to be careful when he calls me now.  Really?  Yeah.  I think he's on lockdown.  We're just good friends, and everyone blew it up, and I think his girlfriend's a little...  Oh, his girlfriend got a little pissed. 
[01:36:00]  ...effective now.  Oh, so you never made out with him, like the papers reported and all that?  No, we weren't even at the place they said we were making out at.  That's right.  I remember you telling us that.  Canoodling.  Canoodling.  Yeah, exactly.  Whatever.  That famous word.  So, Meadow, are we ever going to find out what happened to that Russian dude?  I don't know.  I don't know what's happening next year.  I don't know anything.  I don't get my script until a week before we start filming, and we don't film until  the middle of October now.  That's great.  Now, the other picture.  You with the gold top.  That's the same picture, isn't it? 
[01:36:30]  No.  It's just a different angle of the...  There's the gold sequin top.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, okay.  No, that's the same as the cover, but see, she pulled it off.  No, that's a different top.  No way.  It's a look.  Gold sequin bikini top.  Oh, you're going over there.  Yeah, I'm over here now.  I have a question for you guys.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  Did you guys start a rumor that I was getting kicked off the show because there was a lesbian  scene, and I didn't want to do it?  No.  What?  Someone told me that you guys said that I wasn't going to be in the show anymore because 
[01:37:00]  they wanted me to do a lesbian scene, and I said I wouldn't do it.  We say some stupid things on the show, as you know, Jamie.  Right.  We never said that one.  Never said that one.  I believe you.  No.  Wow.  Honestly, no.  Are you?  No.  We want to congratulate you on the past season.  You, you, you know, came into your own there.  Oh, well, thank you.  You were, you were, you know, awesome.  It was a good year.  Did you get any offers from any other magazines, Time?  For, like, that kind of, this kind of spread? 
[01:37:30]  Time, Newsweek, Swank.  No?  I think I'm going to lay off the men's magazines for a little while.  Yeah.  Anyone else, though?  Any other magazines that you'll be taking?  I'm in this month's Latina, but I don't know if you guys read that one.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And what are you wearing in that?  Oh, nothing too swanky like that.  Nothing like this one?  No.  Hmm.  All right, Latina.  This is kind of like a one-time thing.  Are you really putting out an album?  I really am.  And, like, I don't know.  People don't want to take me seriously, but I'm a singer before I'm an actress. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah?  And so, you know what?  Whatever is going to happen, I can go through life saying I never tried it out.  And this is what I want to do, so.  What kind of music?  Latina music?  It's very Latina, yes.  Oh, that means you're going to be shaking that A.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Is it going to be sold in a package deal with Uncle Junior Sings?  I don't think so, because we're on different labels.  Jamie Lynn, help me out.  You've got to piggyback my record.  I think we're gearing towards different audiences here. 
[01:38:30]  I think so.  Hey, Jamie, have you ever heard of the gay Uncle Junior yet?  The gay Uncle Junior?  Yeah, because there was a rumor in the National Enquirer that the guy that plays, you know, Uncle Junior is gay.  So, you want to hear a little gay Uncle Junior?  Yeah.  Meadow, Meadow, how about that Dr. Kennedy?  He's quite a catch.  He cured me of the ass cancer.  I got that.  The big casino.  No, you've got to help me out. 
[01:39:00]  How's that younger brother of yours?  I like him.  He's shaping into a fine man.  How about a colonoscopy?  Hey, what's up?  He's not gay.  Oh, we know that, but it's funny if he is.  No, there was a rumor, and we went with it.  That's all.  I love these rumors.  She has, like, a long-time girlfriend.  Hey, how's your brother doing?  Like, your brother on the show that got arrested and stuff.  He's fine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That was something.  Did that surprise you, or did you see something like that coming? 
[01:39:30]  Um, no.  I didn't see it coming.  He didn't, he, he, I didn't believe it when I heard it.  Yeah, it seems like he was hanging out with some people that got a little stupid.  Yeah, you know, it's who is at the wrong place at the wrong time.  You know, and he's like me.  I'll put buckle on him.  He still hangs out with his friends from, you know, from growing up and from school and stuff.  And so.  Yeah, they certainly did F up Jamie Lynn potty mouth.  Potty mouth.  You use that kind of language around your parents?  I can't help it. 
[01:40:00]  It's when I'm on the show now.  Oh, I have the worst mouth now.  That sounds so hot.  It is great when you're cursing on the show and stuff.  What?  It is great on the show when you're cursed.  Oh, and they, yeah.  And when you're in bed with guys.  That only happened once.  Yeah.  Not in the reruns.  It happens time and time again.  On my DVD collection.  How old a gal are you, if I can ask?  How old am I?  You're very pretty, yeah.  Thank you.  I'm 20 years old.  20.  Sam, relax. 
[01:40:30]  Norton, 20, right?  20.  And talented and light.  Very talented, yes.  We love her.  Hey, Jamie, are you going to come and see us soon or what?  Sure.  Are you too big for us now?  No, I'm not too big for us.  I'm just very busy right now.  I'm traveling everywhere, so.  Well, we're busy, too.  Of course you are.  Did you hear about our syndicated deal?  I did not.  Please tell me.  We are now in a lot of cities broadcasting live.  Well, congratulations.  Not just New York anymore.  That's right. 
[01:41:00]  Good for you guys.  See, our career is moving forward, too.  I even said something for you guys on the back of a bus.  Oh, yeah.  The wow things.  That's right.  Did you whip them out?  No.  No.  You will know.  I will never whip them out.  Yeah.  You're one of these days, Jamie Lee.  No, I don't think you'll see that for me.  Oh, please.  I get us begging.  I think it's so hot that she doesn't.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good angle to play if you want to, like, try to score with her.  Shut up.  You're in it.  But the, you know. 
[01:41:30]  No, I will never.  You got a steady boyfriend now?  Nope.  No?  I haven't had a boyfriend in over a year.  I haven't even dated anyone in over a year.  Is it because you're career conscious or a bitch on wheels?  I'm not a bitch on wheels.  No, because usually if girls don't have boyfriends for a long time, it's because they're very into  the career or bitch on wheels.  Um, no, it's partially because I'm into my career, but also just because, like, I'm kind  of, I'm a little apprehensive about who I meet and what their intentions are now.  Yeah. 
[01:42:00]  Do you, uh...  You don't know why, you don't know why they're talking to you.  Do you tend to like older gentlemen?  I do actually like the older men more.  You know, because 33 is a good age for a fella.  That's too old.  Oh, Norton, you're out.  You're out.  This whole room is out, except for Ben.  This is a few years.  I know, but you know what?  I just need a guy that, like, has his own thing going on in his life.  I got my own thing happening, Jamie Lynn.  So, like, I, you know, not all of his attention's on me.  I'm an older gentleman.  So then I can have my own life, too.  I hear you. 
[01:42:30]  Any celebrities hitting on you yet?  I'm not a few.  Yeah?  Can you tell us?  No.  You drink with Ben Affleck yet?  No, I've never met him.  No?  No, but I think he's cute.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, wait a minute.  Uh-oh.  Now we're getting...  Hey, I was drunk.  Yeah.  You guys spoke to my brother the other day, huh?  Yeah, he's a person, man.  We like your brother.  Tell him to come down any time.  Okay, well.  I know he likes being here, so...  And when you get your, um...  When you get your album out?  October 16th, it'll be out. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, then you gotta stop by.  Has Russell Crowe tried to have sex with you yet?  We haven't crossed paths yet.  You're the girl that he hasn't had sex with yet?  God, this guy...  He's gotta move you up on his schedule.  Hey, Jamie Lynn.  Yes?  When your album comes out, you come down live to our show, and we'll play it for about 20 cities.  Okay.  We'll play the single for all the cities, okay?  Well, thanks, guys.  And we'll watch your dance moves and stuff.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Jamie.  You're very welcome. 
[01:43:30]  Thanks, Jamie.  Stay in touch, okay?  Okay.  Have a good day, guys.  All kidding aside, it's an amazing pictorial of you.  Yeah, pick up Maxim.  And Maxim Magazine.  Thank you very much.  All right, Jamie.  Okay.  There she goes.  Bye, guys.  We love her.  She's one of those girls, she's so hot, it's depressing.  Like, you ever see a girl...  Because you ain't getting that.  Yeah, it's like you just realize how out of your league some women are, and you just want  to open your veins.  When she says older guy, she means 23.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm pinching my fat, like, oh, maybe I got a shot.  Yeah.  Oh, how about... 
[01:44:00]  36.  You might as well be Uncle Junior.  God.  Hey, how about that Bacala kid?  He's handsome.  How about Dr. Kennedy?  He's good.  And he's a doctor.  And he cured my ass cancer.  The big casino, Tony.  All right, we got dwarfs calling in like crazy.  They want to be part of Dwarfapalooza.  Nice.  We have still the audio of the hissing cockroaches.  And if we don't play that next, people are going to strangle us.  Yeah, play that next.  We will play that next.  And also on the way, blind lap dancing.

WWF Smackdown airs live on UPN.  Anything can happen.  Anything goes.  And when the alliance leader Stone Cold Steve Austin rules with an iron fist, anything will happen. 
[01:45:00]  And that's right, this past Monday, the rattlesnake reaffirmed his role as leader of the alliance  by calling out certain members that he felt were pathetic.  Yeah, that was pretty good stuff.  In order to, uh...  Yes?  Yeah, it was good stuff.  You saw that?  Yeah.  I'm checking out wrestling again.  Well, he's teaching the alliance members about leadership.  He's got the Steve Austin Invitational live on Smackdown.  What does Stone Cold Steve Austin have in store?  Tune in tonight and find out.  The last Smackdown before SummerSlam live tonight. 
[01:45:30]  Tensions are high between The Rock and Booker T, who will gain advantage going into the big pay-per-view event this summer.  Hmm?  Don't miss WWF Smackdown live tonight at 8, only on UPN.  In New York City, you can watch Smackdown live on the 30-foot screen at WWF New York.  Call them up, 212-398-2563.  O.P. and Anthony, every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon, 1027-WNEW.  Hey, you're checking out the O&A show. 
[01:46:00]  The blind guys are getting ready for their lap dances, Anthony.  We got five or six fine ladies from Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Yes!  We love Privilege.  O.P., great place to go if you're in Manhattan.  These girls are...  On the lower, what, west side, right?  Yeah, nice.  They're solid, right, Joe?  Dude, I just went into the bathroom, like one of them had went in, I guess, fixed her hair.  You know that smell, that girl's smell?  It's a nice, like, perfume smell. 
[01:46:30]  The bathroom.  I just wanted to put my face on the toilet.  It goes off.  It goes off.  Just take a nap.  Take a nappy.  God, is that sexy.  Yes, Anthony.  It's so nice to see people from Boston checking back in, that you used to maybe listen to us.  It's Kelly from Boston's checking in here.  Ak-ak.  You used to call me Ak-ak.  I was Op-Op and you were Ak-ak.  Ak-ak.  When you were in Boston, you were married, right?  My sister met you at an AAF party when we were working for AAF and said your woman was a bitch. 
[01:47:00]  New York Magazine said you have a girlfriend of two years, so I wonder what happened.  I think you answered your own question with your email.  An attractive girlfriend, I might say.  Ak-ak.  Can't you put two and two together?  I never realized that, though.  New York Magazine or the other interviews, people read it from Boston and I wonder what happened.  Got to update your facts about Op-Op and Anthony.  There you go.  Just pencil in the appropriate things.  A little catching up to do, as it were. 
[01:47:30]  This guy's really pissed off.  John, what's going on?  Hey, listen, man.  Hey.  I see all the great pictures I took from the WOW thing yesterday in Philly.  The WOW Summit, yeah?  Yeah, they're great pictures.  You've been talking about them all day.  Yep.  But no one knows where they came from because there's no plug there for my website.  Yeah, they're up on opiananthony.com.  They came from your website?  Yeah.  It does say that on, here it is, look, Bar Babes Pictures from Philly. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, and then when you click on it, it says Bad Babes.  I've got to get some props out of this.  I know you guys are always looking for good advertising, so am I.  Well, why don't you plug your site on our show?  Go ahead.  Well, let's do it.  It's barbabes.com.  www.barbabes.com.  Yeah, thanks for helping us out by getting all those pictures yesterday.  Yeah, no problem.  I mean, they're pretty good.  I heard you guys talking about them for a while.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was a sales thing.  We have sales wards that work for the Opian Anthony Show here in New York, and they sell 
[01:48:30]  everything.  Everything.  And I heard that the reason they didn't want to just put your website on ours is because  you didn't pay for it.  Even though this guy is helping out the show, and he went down there on his own time and  got, you know, pictures that everyone is enjoying today.  Right.  What a bunch of scumbags, because that picture of Patty on the back, the John Lennon-looking  picture with Patty looking silly.  Yeah.  I mean, those are classics.  Silly.  Yeah, I know.  Those are O&A classics.  She looks silly.  If you're enjoying the pictures from the WOW Summit, a lot of them did come from this 
[01:49:00]  guy and his website's barbabes.com.  Cool.  And if you get a bill from the sales department here, just rip it up.  Yeah, exactly.  Because they will send you a bill.  No doubt.  No doubt.  And I'll send them a bill for using the pictures, too, so they'll all wash in the mail.  These idiots, they sold the WOW Summit.  It was just something that we wanted to do.  It was like, hey, quick idea.  We're going to get some Harleys and a bunch of really hot girls and send them down to Philly.  They're going to flash for 20 or 30 minutes, hang out with the crowd, and come back to 
[01:49:30]  New York.  The sales whores sold that.  They will sell everything and anything.  I was embarrassed.  We went to commercials here in New York.  I was like, the WOW Summit's sponsored by Red Bull.  Yeah, you know, because I saw those guys.  I saw a lot of suits down there, down in Philly.  And I knew they were up to something, obviously.  You're sponsoring a bunch of guys on bikes going from New York to Philly.  Yeah.  Do you have any shame?  None.  And then you want to hear the best part, too.  If you look at the pictures, there's a picture of the fake tan girl.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  She sent me an email.  It's really funny.  She sent me an email this morning that said that she has this job and she's going to get  fired if anyone sees her.  So I sent a thing back to her that said, you know what?  Well, maybe if you wouldn't show your keys while we're cruising down the turnpike at 65  miles an hour, I think your chance for privacy is kind of thrown out the window when you  do that, when you flash people on the turnpike.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Kind of good for that.  Thanks, fellas.  John from BarBabes.com.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  We'll talk to you soon.  By the way, our magazine signing party, sponsored by Heineken tonight, Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, it is?  Holy ass.  I have no problems with Heineken, but Jesus.  Everything is sponsored.  They're sponsoring everything we do.  All right.  Anthony playing foosball between commercial breaks, sponsored by...  You know, I'm surprised they haven't jumped on that yet.  Oh, now they will.  Yeah.  Anthony plays foosball during commercial breaks?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll sponsor that.  This inappropriate bell singing was sponsored by...  You're kidding.  They made inappropriate bells for all their clients. 
[01:51:00]  Yep.  We have this bell.  We haven't really explained this to other cities yet, but when something really outrageous  is said, which usually is every two minutes, Jim Norton...  Oh, pipe down over there.  We ring the inappropriate bell to make everything okay.  Just a goofy little thing we started.  Well, it's then acknowledged as being inappropriate and probably should have been held back on  being said.  Right.  We might have went a little too far.  Why doesn't...  Speaking of which, we broke the bell yesterday when Otto and George was in here. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  That's why you didn't hear it at the end of the show, because it wasn't ringing anymore.  He was funny last night, too, man.  It's cool, buddy.  So, the salespeople, they pick up on this idea, and they have like 200 really cheap versions  of our inappropriate bell made, and they hand them out to all their salespeople.  Ugh.  You tinkle this.  You'll feel like you're part of this show.  Creeps.  Opie taking a sip of water.  Sponsored by O2Go.  They're so ungrateful, too.  When Ant and I got here, they were making no money whatsoever. 
[01:52:00]  Of course they are.  And now they have no shame, and they're just whoring out every second of this show.  Of course they are.  They're just human colostomy bags.  This commercial for O2Go is sponsored by Sam Adams.  I mean, why not?  Why not?  Anyway, can we play the hissing cockroaches finally?  Yes.  From the 55-gallon drum challenge.  And we have a whole new audience, so you've got to explain.  Basically, we're in FHM Magazine with Anna Kornikova on the cover.  Yeah.  We'll be signing copies of that in many of the magazines we've been in lately at Hooters. 
[01:52:30]  Right after the show, a little over an hour from right now, 56 between Broadway and 7th.  Bring your magazines.  More importantly, just come and hang and have fun with us, okay?  Yeah.  But there was a question in there about one of the most outrageous moments on our show or something like that.  55-gallon drum challenge.  We discussed the 55-gallon drum challenge.  We had a bunch of girls come down.  We locked them in 55-gallon drums with some holes in the top and dumped in the most heinous things you could imagine.  Everything from chum, syrup, dead animals. 
[01:53:00]  I mean, it was disgusting.  And we finally put the hissing cockroaches in.  Right.  We had live hissing cockroaches.  Pitch black in these barrels, too, by the way.  Yeah.  So they're just laying in about four inches of liquid crap and sloshing around in these barrels.  And then we poured hissing cockroaches on their heads, and they lost their minds.  They freaked out.  And it just sounds like a serial killer's house. 
[01:53:30]  Sounds like the basement of a serial killer's house with the echo of the drum and everything.  So here's just a little taste from the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, no, no.  Okay, here is where we really separate the champions from the chumps.  Here it is.  This is it.  This is the ultimate.  It's over.  Okay.  Girls? 
[01:54:00]  Girls?  Wait, wait.  You got to do it all at the same time.  All at the same time.  All the girls at the same time?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Okay.  Everybody.  No one else is going to do it.  What is that?  That was something making noise.  That isn't somebody doing that into a mic?  No.  Listen, listen, listen.  Oh, my God. 
[01:54:30]  Holy Jesus!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  Remember, girls, just yell.  Wait, I'm going to whisper it to the mic.  Wait, I'm going to whisper it to the mic.  They're hissing, hissing roaches.  They're huge, like the ones you see on Indiana Jones.  Oh, my God, that's horrible.  Oh, no, it's horrible. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, no, it's horrible.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I give up.  It rubs the lotion.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, my God.  What is she doing?  She's hyperventilating.  Okay.  Anyone want out?  Do you wish to leave?  Wendy, do you wish to leave?  No.  Oh, my God, no.  That's true.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Wendy, how are you?  Huh?  Oh, she's horrified.  You all right?  I can't even talk right now.  Go to someone else.  All right.  Let's go to Jane.  Jane?  Jane?  Jane's fine. 
[01:56:00]  Well, see, the merciful thing is my goggles are so fine.  I don't even know what that was.  Oh, good.  Okay.  And Tabitha.  And Tabitha.  I just want to know what that was.  Oh, my God.  That's even more horrible.  They don't even know what it is.  Oh.  Hissing cockroaches.  Don't, please, don't tell us.  Yeah, I don't want to know anymore.  Don't tell us until we get out, please.  Really?  Really, like, don't tell us.  Okay.  Oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  Don't tell them that they're.  Don't tell them.  I got to tell them.  I got to tell them.  You got to tell them.  Listen to the noise they make.  Go ahead.  Listen to the noise they make.  Rick didn't even want to touch it.  No.  Booga, booga, looga.  All right.  I'm over here now.  I'm a hissing cockroach.  Thanks, guys.  And there you have a little taste.  They're in just dark, dark barrels, and those hissing cockroaches were in there with them. 
[01:57:00]  Just crawling all over them.  The screams.  Norton, what about those screams of terror?  Well, they, like, how do they not make you heavy in the privates?  Isn't that amazing?  And we have to.  We almost forgot, by the way, the hissing cockroach is sponsored by Puerto Ricans everywhere.  Yo, man, I'm half Puerto Rican, Norton.  Yeah, what's he going to do?  Hey, Blind Matt and Blind Dave are back in the studio. 
[01:57:30]  We'll box you, bitch.  We're going to have the 55-gallon drum challenge, too.  To a race.  Yeah.  We've got to set aside.  We have to do that.  I know.  We've got to set aside a day for it.  Next, coming up on ONA.  We did the blind thing.  We've got to move on to other things for a while.  I don't know.  Screw the lawyers.  We've got to come up with blind kickboxing.  So, Blind Dave's in the studio.  Blind Matt's in the studio.  You guys doing?  You guys, we've got some really hot girls from Privileged Gentleman's Club.  Yeah, we heard from the guys out there that they weren't that hot. 
[01:58:00]  Who told you that?  They are really solid.  Who's telling you they're not hot?  Who said that?  You're insane.  We heard that they weren't that hot, that they were just gross outs for the blind guys.  Listen, Joe Elliott, they're very attractive girls.  I heard that they're very hot, so Dave, you'll enjoy yourself.  Dude, they're solid, man.  They're really solid.  I was thinking more he's in the line of if Dave Mustaine looked in an eclipse. 
[01:58:30]  Dave, you've got the Dave Mustaine hairdo to go, yes.  Who, me?  Yeah.  I cut it off a year ago.  I don't know.  All right.  I asked a girl who was hanging out there.  I fell for an Adam's apple.  Oh, you were feeling for Adam's apple?  Look, guys, these are girls.  They are very hot.  They work at Privilege Gentleman's Club, so they're not going to be slouches.  Yeah, but I could see you guys just totally like, we gave these blind guys transvestites. 
[01:59:00]  No, we wouldn't do that.  Huh?  No, they're hot, dude.  They're really hot.  No, you guys, you did the job.  You came across with the blind boxing.  It was great for the show, and now we're paying you back by giving you hot girls to give you  lap dances.  We're not going to try to...  By giving you transvestites.  No, they're not.  You...  And, well, we're going to open up the studio door and...  I'm joking, Anthony.  And let the strippers in.  Let the lovely ladies in. 
[01:59:30]  Here they come.  Woo!  Here they come.  Here they come.  Nice.  Yeah!  How about you bring the girls in, Rick?  Hey, Rick.  Anytime.  I thought they were here.  No, no, into the studio.  Bring the strippers in.  Nice.  If my girlfriend is listening, this is all just a radio gag.  You saw the...  Strippers, say hi to Blind Matt and Blind Dave. 
[02:00:00]  There are no strippers.  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about, bitch?  Hi, guys.  Hi, how are you doing?  What are you going to do to, uh...  What are you going to do for these guys when you get in the lap dance?  Hi, how are you?  It's the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Yeah.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  He looks like your brother, Bobby.  Yeah, he does.  The babbling.  The babbling scots.  This guy, he looks like your brother a little bit.  Okay. 
[02:00:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Hi, how are you doing?  I'm fine.  Retarded Laverne and Shirley.  I'm fine.  We're here for the signing lady, one of Hooters.  I'm leaving.  I am leaving.  This was just a joke.  We got the real strippers.  We got the real strippers.  Ying Yang Party.  Ying Yang Party.  Their call sign from the 80s when they used to go out partying.  Stinky just popped the...  Stinky just clocked her the head with the microphone.  Marion on the head with the microphone.  That's nice.  Isn't that great?  And now she's kicking. 
[02:01:00]  You're shaking your legs.  Oh, God.  What happens, Stinky?  That's all the time.  I hear my legs.  Give them a little weight.  What's up, Stinky?  She went to kick me, so I grabbed a leg.  There's like bear fur all over there.  Brundle fly hair.  She's got a cap like a lamb chop.  Look at that.  She should have fey ray on her back.  Mosquito bites on hers.  Mosquito bites on her legs.  That's...  Marion, what did you do to your head?  It looks different.  It looks different today.  I got it back in Barrett.  Oh, in Barrett.  Okay, I was wondering, because it looked different.  Are you?  Does my hair look a little better? 
[02:01:30]  It got longer.  You know something?  You still have the bowl cut.  You look like a...  I'm getting a part.  Very funny.  You look like a prince.  I look like a prince.  Yeah, Prince Valiant.  Prince Valiant.  Yeah, the awful Sunday cartoon about the fat lady.  How do I look now?  I'm well, thank you.  How are you doing?  Now, you know what that hair is?  You know whose haircut you got?  Remember the girl from The Little Rascals, the real early ones?  Mary.  Mary, that used to hang out with Jack and Weezer?  That's the hair, dude.  When I was five years old, I used to look like Darla.  She's too close to me, Jim.  Yes, she is.  Really? 
[02:02:00]  All right, listen, listen, listen, ladies.  She's a beautiful creature.  She's a beautiful creature.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's a beautiful creature.  Even blind people can goof on the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Look at the retarded.  Hey, Dave.  Look at that beautiful.  Look at them.  Look at them.  Dave, I've got to ask Dave.  Just by listening to their voices, what do you think in your head they look like?  Seriously, I need to know.  What do you think?  I think they're retarded.  What do you think?  Now, honestly, you've heard them on the show a lot. 
[02:02:30]  What do you think they look like?  I've heard them, yeah.  Now, Marion, say hi to Dave.  Hi, Dave.  How are you?  What do you think?  How are you doing, Marion?  You sound like I'm big, red, hot.  Yeah, well.  It would probably be sexier to have hissing cockroaches into your balloon nut.  Yeah, well.  And now.  We're only making it a yeah, well, because you guys are blind.  Lady Di. 
[02:03:00]  Yes.  Now, say hi to Dave.  How are you doing, Dave?  Now, what do you think she looks like based on her voice?  Seriously, what do you think she looks like?  Visualize.  She sounds like she's got a nose like a hook nose jewel.  Oh, my.  And a chin.  That's nice.  Have you been hitting the bottle again, Dave?  Dave's hammered.  No, come on.  All right.  All right.  Can we get the.  What color, what color, what color, what color hair do I have?  I wish it was red because your head was cracked open.  Thanks, Dorton. 
[02:03:30]  I think I have.  Thanks, Dorton.  Blind Matt's laughing so hard his eye almost popped out.  Because how the hell am I going to know what color hair you have, you freaking ugly.  Take a guess.  Hey, why are you being polite?  Usually when people attack you, you attack back.  Yeah.  I, because.  Are you, are you, uh.  I'm getting pity on the block.  You're prejudiced because he's blind?  No, no, no.  Are you just kidding me?  No, this is the new me.  No, this is the new me.  This is the new me.  Why?  No, you know me.  Why?  My color hair do I have. 
[02:04:00]  She keeps pounding her in the head with the microphone.  It's the funniest goddamn thing.  I don't know.  That's not her.  I don't want to make fun.  Okay, listen.  Dave, it's almost as bad as her talking when you imitate her.  Party, guys.  All right, ladies, we'll see you at the magazine signing party at Hooters right after the show.  Great.  Ying Yang Party, girl.  We'll be there downstairs in an hour, 56 between Broadway and 7th.  You're going to Florida.  Great.  We'll talk about that in a while.  Have a good trip, Ratso Rizzo.  Ratso Rizzo. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Joe, you're a lovely person, Joe.  I don't want you to leave, Joe.  Go wet yourself on a bus.  I'm falling apart.  You took a rest of my own schedule.  Ripping a pool of AIDS and crack your skull, you bitch.  Wow.  I love it when blind people reference AIDS.  And that's why she didn't attack back.  She knows that you can't appreciate the full implications of her awfulness.  Yeah.  Norton rules.  Yeah, Norton does rule.  Norton rules.  Let's take a break and we'll get your lap dances out of the way here.

F-U to K-Y-C-Y, the station we're on in San Francisco, for playing country songs during all your local commercial breaks. 
[02:07:00]  What?  This is a bad dream.  It's bad enough that they don't delay a show until p.m. drive.  Now it's effing country songs every 15 minutes.  Country?  This is insane.  Oh.  Not country.  Country.  Country is really bad music.  Country.  No one likes country.  Effing country.

[02:08:00]  Blind Dave.  And fall into a pool of AIDS.  Are you really blind or do you just drink too much?  He is.  You know when you're like, I drank so much I was blind last night.  Dave, you drank a lot today again.  Dave?  The mic's right in front of you.  You can talk.  Yeah.  Dave, you drank a lot again today?  No.  Passed out.  Dave?  Hello, Dave.  Passed out.  All right.  Listen.  Take the mic away.  You know, in an hour, his liver's going to be in the lobby calling 911. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, that puffy thing in between your ribs was not your spleen.  That was your liver.  Trying to get out.  Trying to get out.  Right.  He's got that 97-1 voice, though, at night.  Yeah.  Slow jams to commit crimes to.  No.  Oh, my God.  It's a slow thing.  Stinky taste.  Right?  Before he tries to drink it.  He pulled it out.  He pulled the mic apart. 
[02:09:00]  Look out.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, Dan.  Sit down, Dan.  Dave's swinging.  All right, listen.  Can we get the girls from Gentleman's...  Oh, we've got to come in.  Privilege...  Oh, boy.  He'll behave himself.  Privilege Gentleman's Club.  They're located on 23rd and 11th in Chelsea.  I see them tipping some bottles out.  The dancers.  All right.  Here come the ladies, guys.  Here comes the adult entertainment.  Sorry to make you ladies wait.  I'm so sorry.  Hi, girls.  Nice.  Here they are.  Wow.  We're so happy.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  There we go.  They're showing all kinds of body parts there.  They can't see.  Oh, nice.  Make out session.  Make out session.  Oh.  And the other girl's doing the other one.  It tastes as good.  In the back featuring.  The inside of my boxers looks like a Quincy episode.  Spanking over there.  Making out over there.  Nice.  All right, Blind Dave, sit back down on your couch.  You're scaring me. 
[02:10:00]  It's Madison and Camille and Hennessy and Chica and Samantha in the house from Privilege.  Yeah.  Over 23rd and 11th.  Boys, come on down tonight.  Smell a perfume.  You can only mean one thing.  Hey, did number 77 flash us yet?  Yes.  Look at the areola.  Oh, wow.  Whoa, man.  All right.  Take it off.  Oh, yeah.  Those are the quarters.  Those are something.  You're getting my big brown eyes, baby.  Yeah.  One minute.  I haven't seen you for a little while.  Looks like a moose head. 
[02:10:30]  Who, me?  Yeah.  Me and Madison, I haven't seen you.  Oh, no.  Madison, we've seen recently.  I haven't seen you.  Pretty recently.  Hey, how you doing?  The last time I came was when the guy from Big Brother was here.  Right.  Eddie from Big Brother.  Eddie from Big Brother.  Yeah.  That was a little while ago.  Ladies, um.  Are we ready?  Yeah.  We're trying to get Blind Dave to sit down again.  Is Steve C. giving Blind Dave an attitude adjustment?  Hey, Steve.  What's going on, Steve?  He's fine. 
[02:11:00]  He's fine.  He's all under control.  What were you saying to him?  He's plastered.  He's plastered.  Get him naked women now.  Yes, Steve C.  But you were threatening him.  And the guy's fine.  He's so out of his mind.  I gave him some of my maker's mark before.  All right.  And maybe that was a bad call.  Dave.  Because he's out of his mind.  Steve.  Blasted.  Steve is talking out of his mind.  All right.  Sit down, Dave.  Oh, man.  Sit down.  Hey, you're not driving home, are you?  That old gag.  Well, he has a driver's license. 
[02:11:30]  He does have a driver's license.  I'm not driving home.  Steve's talking out of his mind.  What was the driver's driving license story again?  Connecticut was kind enough to give him a driver's license because he had a friend with  him that told him, all right, now I'm three steps.  You'll be at the counter.  And then I think he...  You memorized the chart or something, right?  Yeah.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  His friend totally helped him out.  They probably gave him a license because he was so drunk.  They're like, go ahead.  Let him hit a pole.  He said he needed glasses, so he couldn't really see very well, so he told him to... 
[02:12:00]  Could you just put the tip of the pen where I have to sign?  Yeah.  He goes, because I don't have my glasses with me.  Don't look at it.  They gave him a license.  Don't read it.  Sign it.  That is a legitimate Connecticut license.  Connecticut license.  Yeah.  Officially blind Dave could drive in Connecticut.  There you go.  Now sit down, Dave.  We're going to give you a lap dance.  Is he facing in the right direction in the picture?  Yeah, that would be something.  Shut up, Norton.  You were out there. 
[02:12:30]  You were like...  All right, Dave.  Sit down.  Oh, my God.  Sit down.  We have to get you to your...  He slams you.  He slams you.  Norton is...  Norton rules, man.  Norton rules.  Quiet.  Dave's talking.  Hey, there's a cop outside.  Anyone getting arrested today?  Who's getting arrested?  He's giving me faces.  Any outstanding warrants or anything?  And we're flashing the cops.  Let's flash them, girl.  Flash the cops.  Let's...  Woo!  These babbling scruppers are sponsored by Sam Adams. 
[02:13:00]  Kill him.  That's great.  Flash your voice.  Kill him.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Girls, girls.  Here are the two guys.  You can identify the blind guys over on the chair.  Well, Dave won't sit down.  Dave, why don't you sit and enjoy your lap dance?  My license is gone.  Your license isn't gone?  No.  Here it is.  Take control of him.  All right.  There's your license back.  Now, sit down and...  Someone had his license.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Man, I went through some serious crap to get that, man.  I actually handed him back a Visa card.  All right.  Sit down, Dave.  Come on.  This is for you.  Okay.  All right.  I'm serious.  Hey.  And O&A, you guys rule, man.  Thank you, Dave.  Hey, thank you.  We're going to have to bring him down to Hooters, man.  Now, take a seat on the couch.  And, uh...  Yes, Opie.  Yes, Rick.  Oh, that is awful.  Chica's never been here before, so I thought you guys should say hello to her.  Hey, how are you doing?  Hey.  How are you? 
[02:14:00]  Very good.  And you, uh...  Hi.  She's beautiful, yeah.  She sounds like Selma Hayek.  Talk.  Oh, what do you want me to say?  Oh, there you go.  Say you're not my favorite person right now.  You are not my favorite person right now.  Wow.  That went right through me.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  Oh, you're kind of taking a shine to Rick there, huh?  I like those dolls there.  Oh, you like the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dolls?  That's pretty cool.  We have the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dolls in the numbered position, as it were. 
[02:14:30]  Are you serious?  Yeah, look.  Look at their face.  Oh, my God.  Look, it's the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen dolls.  Oh, my God.  Isn't that great?  Look at the little boobies.  That's so cute.  Hey, this is Ashley right here.  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  Dave is so drunk.  They're only three years younger than me.  Don't make fun of them.  Oh, how old are you?  18.  You're 18?  Barely legal.  That's good. 
[02:15:00]  Doesn't he have...  That's a chain siren.  I hate myself.  Dave's hair.  Smooth Dave's hair looks like.  You ever see the Sasquatch and the $6 million man?  I'm not, Norton.  I'm not, Norton.  Can I tell you guys something?  Yeah.  Sure.  I have my own line of handbags coming out in October, and I just...  Oh, oh.  Handbags.  Handbags.  This is Hennessy.  Hi, guys.  Anyway, so I'll come back up here, and I'll give you all the information, but I'm just letting  you know.  You're going to...  They get up my bags.  Your own line of handbags? 
[02:15:30]  Handbags.  It's like purses and stuff.  And every handbags.  So, I'm just letting you guys know, because I'm promoting it now.  Is there a special section in the bag for a hanky and some chloroforms?  I can make some more like that.  I can make some for that.  Yes, yes.  There's special packets for condoms on it.  I can make special compartments for anything.  I can make some vibrators.  You have one for vibrators, too?  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  The back and rocking.  See, at the clubs, you pay them not to call.  The jack wrapping?  You know the jack wrapping? 
[02:16:00]  You're paying them for.  Okay.  You can see them naked other times, but you pay them to shut up.  Nice.  Anyway.  Madison is being very quiet.  She's behaving.  I'm quiet.  Because she's been here.  Madison knows this show.  She knows the deal.  She's like, they don't want yapping.  They just want naked.  I'm sorry.  It's okay.  No.  You got your teeth pulled?  I got my wisdom teeth pulled.  You did?  I hear a protein bath helps that. 
[02:16:30]  On the back molar portion of the...  Helps from getting dry socket.  Hi, Stevie.  Okay, listen.  I've gotten that.  This is a mess today.  Yeah.  Like today would be any different.  You don't want a girl with your eyes.  All right.  Whoa, nice.  All right.  Let's turn down the lights.  We got the blind guys on the couch.  Just hit play.  Just hit play.  Ladies.  Just push play.  If you will.  By Errol Smith, baby.  Why are you dimming the lights?  They're blind.  All right.  Here are the girls.  They're all over the blind guys. 
[02:17:00]  Hey!  Let's get a mic on Dave.  All right.  Now they're stripping so quickly.  You know, the old reliable, the strippers.  Some girls, we got to sit here and beg like we're begging for water on a slave ship.  But no, these girls take it right off with no prompting.  Dave taking advantage of the lap dance.  Oh, it's been a little small.  I don't know.  Let's listen in for a minute.  Listen to Dave.  Listen to drunk Dave.  Look at Matt.  Oh. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Matt.  Matt looked like he was bombing for apples.  That's a few.  That's a few.  I'm privileged, baby.  Woo-hoo!  All right.  The girls all over the blind guys.  They are really just all over them.  Dave is spanking the girls.  Look at this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Take the script.  Give some chocolate milk for you, baby.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Chocolate silk milk. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, she must have some Hershey's chocolate milk with her.  Yeah, I think that's what she was talking about.  I tell you, baby, it smells like crushed rose water, doesn't it?  Try her elbow.  He was sucking anyway.  Oh, yeah.  It smells like I like to choke.  Now she's turned.  Oh, my God.  It smells like I like to choke.  He's got girls all over them. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  The girls are spanking each other.  Dave's just got both hands full.  Two blind men have girls crawl all over them.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Look at what I'm seeing out of the back of that.  Oh, I know.  It's meany.  Did you see that?  Lovely.  Did you see that?  Right there, right?  Yeah, right there. 
[02:19:00]  Plump.  Looks like Mick Jagger's face is hanging out.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He's getting up.  Dave, put down the stripper.  He's picked up the 18-year-old.  Put down the stripper, Dave.  Dave has picked up the 18-year-old, and he's hammered.  He's walking around with Rosie Perez.  Oh, wow.  They are really like it.  And unlike a real strip club that you go to, they are allowed to touch the girl. 
[02:19:30]  Yes.  What is...  Wow, you sound like a horse.  What are they doing?  You sound like a horse.  She's yelling.  You can just imagine what that was, right?  These two guys.  Oh, boy.  So great.  Did you hear what she said?  Yes, I did.  I didn't know that we were on the food line.  Looks like someone is having a little too much fun on the couch.  A little too much fun.  And isn't that cool? 
[02:20:00]  They're getting Blind Matt's guide dog involved, doing a red rocket to him.  Look at that.  Red rocket.  Red rocket.  Think of all the fun you're having right now.  Oh, my God.  Let's listen to Dave for a second.  About ready to kill me.  That bitch.  Dave, how are you doing?  I think I'm...  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  It's alive. 
[02:20:30]  He wants to come out and play.  What the hell are they doing with these guys?  It's alive.  It's alive.  It's alive.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I'm at a dump here.  I'm at a dump here.  Hold on, ladies.  Hold on.  I'm at a dump.  Hold on, ladies.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Wow.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  It seems that the blind guy is packing some mule. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, dude, I'll trade my eyes for your mule.  Hi, Chico.  Hi.  Wow.  I've never seen strippers get turned on before.  Seriously.  They are freaking over blind men.  They're digging.  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at Chocolates ready to do something over there.  Don't you?  You are, baby.  Wow.  Just do it for a second.  You're definitely privileged. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, brother.  They're giving the corporate line.  Yeah.  Woo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what's she doing?  Wow.  I like this.  I make that sound on my nephew's stomach.  I like that sound on my nephew.  That's the cocky rocket.  All right.  Wow.  Look at Dave's legs are in the air.  What's going on?  I just see Dave's sneakers poking over the console. 
[02:22:00]  I don't think these guys have ever had more fun in their life.  No, this is amazing.  Dave is just...  Dave is now attacking one of the strippers.  Hey, dude, did you go blind when your mule hit your eye?  Hi, papi.  Dime como te gusta.  Hey.  Okay, just don't hurt me.  I'll give you my money.  And then Bubbles died.  Flash me, baby.  All right.  Wow. 
[02:22:30]  Okay, Andre.  Flash me.  Holy Jesus, man.  I'm going to turn down the mics over there for a little bit.  There is stuff going on over there.  I don't even know what made the radio.  All we can tell you is that Blind Dave, Blind Matt on the couch, they're both pitching you-know-what right now.  One of the girls just had to swipe away Blind Matt's hand.  He just went to grab her like a bowling ball.  Oh, really?  I swear to God.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  No, we've shut the mics down over there, Rick, so it's okay. 
[02:23:00]  I want to make you feel good.  All right.  The girls, they still want to dance for the Blind Guys, so that's cool.  The black chick is so digging Matt's hog.  Ladies, I can't see you.  Thank you, baby.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Wow.  All we can say is, how can we describe this so it makes the air, Anthony?  Well, they noticed something was going on with Blind Matt. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Dave.  He just licked the dirty penny.  Dave just licked the dirty penny.  Dave just licked the dirty penny.  What?  Oh, uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Blast pant.  What?  You don't like that?  That's how the, uh...  Oh, Dave.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Dave.  Wow.  If I could describe it in the blind context, if you saw two guide dogs come up to each other, 
[02:24:00]  what would they do to each other?  Well, okay.  That's what Dave is doing.  Oh, it's so great.  Isn't that amazing?  What is going on here?  Well, you know something?  Oh, my God.  With the acute sense of smell that blind people have, I'm surprised he would go there.  Look at those muscles.  Don't C block them?  Yeah, don't C block them.  All right, listen.  This guy's blind.  We're going to take a break.  The girls won't even know.  They'll continue dancing.  Anthony, some of the...  We have to sum this up somehow. 
[02:24:30]  Well, it's five girls, two blind guys, and they are getting very involved with each other.  Let's just say faces are meeting places.  Very good.  On both parties.  Very good.  On everyone involved here.  The black stripper?  Yeah.  Just completely freaked when she saw what Matt was packing.  Matt's mule, because she's used to something like that being black, probably, with the  myth and the...  First time I've ever seen a stripper truly turned on.  That would explain why he doesn't need a cane with him. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, he doesn't need a cane.  Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.  Herb, we're going to finish up this mess next, okay?  Okay.  Ladies have no clue that we're not on the radio anymore.  Wow.  Bobby.  The girls, they dance at Privilege Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th.  They're all really, really hot.  What are you doing here?  All right.  They're just yapping over there.  We'll be back.  O.P. Anthony.

[02:27:00]  Hooters, 56th Street between Broadway and 7th.  We'll be there in like a half hour.  I want to thank the ladies from Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Nice.  23rd and 11th in Chelsea.  You ladies have fun?  I want to talk to the black lady, the fine African princess.  I had a blast.  Now listen, because we've got to keep it clean kind of for the radio, so follow us, all right?  You were freaking out when you saw what blind Matt had, what he had sporting, right? 
[02:27:30]  What he was packing.  Yeah, he was definitely packing down there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And you were liking that big time.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah, you were kind of using it.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Good thing.  Good thing.  She was making this noise.  Yeah, what was that?  No, baby, it's like this.  Like a girl going down a slide with no panties. 
[02:28:00]  You got it.  74, I heard that.  Yeah.  Where's the annoying laugh, Anthony?  He was on the line.  He wanted us to plug his limo company.  He's getting pissed off.  We got to thank Anthony from Vital Transportation and Top Notch Limousine for getting Blind Dave here today.  Ah, how about that?  I want to talk to him.  We haven't talked to him in a while.  Maybe he'll call back.  Thank God someone's driving him home.  Because he is.  Is he showing up at Hooters?  We might bring him downstairs. 
[02:28:30]  Because let me tell you something.  And he is slammed.  Gone.  Post.  Isaac, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I learned today that God played tricks all white, guys.  You can't have big junk and...  And sight, I think he was going to say.  And sight?  Was that it?  Yep, and sight.  Yeah, God definitely played tricks all white, boys.  Yeah.  All right.  It looks like Matt and Dave both had a great time.  Concord, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I got a couple.  The cock, yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Yes, number two, one stalker Patty wows.  It looks like a retard watching a Ferris wheel.  Yeah.  Or the fabulous cotton candy machine.  Yes, the fabulous cotton candy machine.  Natural.  Norton subscribes to SI for kids.  Let's see.  Dwarfs like alcohol.  Yes.  We're going to have Dwarfapalooza coming soon to the O&A show.  Oh, yes, yes, very soon.  All the nuts you can drink.  Bad water creates wows.  Opie gave us his spaz reference on that. 
[02:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh.  And Anthony thinks Ben Affleck is cute.  Very good.  Thanks, Concord.  Man.  All right, man.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Sandy Cain's hemorrhoids are spotted by cheese dips.  Cheese it.  Cheese it.  No, it's all right, yeah.  That's all right, guys.  All right, man.  Here's the annoying laugh, Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  What's wrong?  He's not going to puke in my van, is he?  What, Blind Dave?  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  I don't know.  Is he a puker?  There are some people that drink and puke every time they're the pukers.  No, he doesn't.  I know someone that knows him.  He never pukes.  He's not a puker?  No, not at all.  He is hammered.  Nice.  Nice, yeah.  But he's great.  He's going to just, like, abuse my job the whole way home.  Is it dairy?  Uh, probably, yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  We should get audio of that.  The ride home.  We should.  Dave yelling at the driver, that would be hilarious stuff.  Sucks to be the driver, but we'll get some good audio for the ride. 
[02:30:30]  Did you like your plug today, Ant?  Yeah, thanks.  Very nice.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Sincere.  Okay.  Goodbye.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Where's Dave?  Bye.  And Matt?  He's on his knees out there doing something.  He's a mess today.  He really is.  Like, I thought he was snotted last time for blind boxing.  Yeah.  But this time, he is completely hammered.  Hammered.  Craig, what's up?  Today, I learned that country water gives you dwarves, baby.  All right, guys. 
[02:31:00]  You suck.  Take care.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Josie, Gary learned, next time I'm banging my chick, I'll be worrying about sporting a puffy spleen.  Yeah, you got to watch the puffy spleen.  Puffy spleen.  Let's go to Turkish.  Turkish, what's up?  Hey, I learned you don't pay strippers to dance.  You pay them to shut up.  Pay them to shut up.  Later.  Gary, they're right here.  Gary from Columbus.  I learned sweet-talking stripper lingo is really hot until the corporate line comes out.  Where's Dave? 
[02:31:30]  Right here.  Where is he?  Right here.  Oh, Dave, what's up?  Oh, B.  Did you enjoy your lap dance?  I didn't get it yet.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, what?  Dave?  I didn't get it yet.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Dave, what are you on drugs?  No, I'm on alcohol.  You got your lap dance, and you seem to enjoy it very much.  Let's talk to Matt.  Yeah, let's talk to Matt.  We didn't get no lap dance. 
[02:32:00]  What's up, guys?  What are you talking about?  Hey, Matt.  Come on.  Hey.  I think Dave had a nice lap dance, and he seemed to enjoy himself.  Yeah.  And the girls were very attractive.  Whoa.  What are you talking about?  And Dave nearly had to leave before the end of the show to take care of his own little  business in the bathroom.  That's plain math.  Oh, I can't swear by it, but that's what I mean.  Whoa.  And you look like you're smuggling the thigh of a lion in your pants.  You're my new idol.  They're all so full.  They used to call me the myth in the locker room. 
[02:32:30]  They thought I was good.  They're all so full of crap that it ain't for you.  Your nickname's the myth?  What are you packing?  That's what they used to say.  Norton wants to know what you're packing.  What are you packing?  You know, about two inches from the floor.  Well, let him tell you.  I guess he could do it.  I don't know.  Hey, Dave.  It seems like you have a problem with what Matt just said.  What do you mean?  You were going, whoa, and stuff.  Yeah, like, whoa.  No, I thought that was it.  You know, that's...  Hey. 
[02:33:00]  He's just gone.  All right.  Dave, what would I miss say?  Half you.  What would I miss say?  No, I'm not just gone.  I hear that.  What was the problem, Senator Kennedy?  What happened?  I don't know.  You told me.  All right.  Steve.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  I heard that Norton would give his two good eyes for blind Dave's mule.  It was blind Mads.  Very good.  But like I said, you know, these girls from Privilege, they rule, and they gave Dave a nice time. 
[02:33:30]  I know if I spoke to Dave.  This is a girl full of crap.  It's like, his girlfriend, he is...  Dave, what's the problem that you won't just fess up to the fact that everyone had a great time?  With the girls from Privilege.  We all had a great time.  Guys, can we put our hands together for the girls from Privilege?  This is his girlfriend.  How about that?  Yeah.  He's saying that because he can't handle it afterwards.  Because afterwards, he is going to be living in hell. 
[02:34:00]  No, no, no.  Listen, listen, listen.  Like most of the rest of us, he's living in hell.  All right, Dave.  Dave.  Ladies and gentlemen, again, O&A suck.  The girls from Privilege rule.  And, you know, this station...  No, they don't suck.  ...finally should be Kate and O&A.  All right, Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  It's a mess.  I learned tonight that male protein shakes can help a girl get over the wisdom teeth problem. 
[02:34:30]  It eliminates dry socket.  And I learned something while I was on hold, too, is that we faithful listeners have not missed annoying Laugh Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Great show, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  I learned something today, guys.  Yeah?  Hairy chicks going to Philadelphia have hair on their chinny-chin-chins.  Wow.  You were certainly playing.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Did somebody talk about like a girl with hair on her chinny-chin-chin-chins?  Be quiet, sir.  On the way to desa-  Be quiet. 
[02:35:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't curse.  Sometimes things are better left unsaid.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  You know what?  All right.  F'd up.  I hate this place.  Meditations don't work.  But I'm not saying anything that ain't supposed to be said.  All right, let's go to Barb, checking in from Cleveland.  Barb, what's up?  Nothing.  How are you guys doing tonight?  I don't know what this sounds like. 
[02:35:30]  The last half hour was a mess.  Well, I wanted to tell you that I learned how to make soccer panties gums out of chewing gum today.  Right.  Wait, wait, hold on.  We missed something.  Hold on.  Barb, hold that thought.  Hold on.  What happened?  Dave just reached over and he keeps doing it.  He keeps asking Madison, hey, are you the chick that I ain't?  And he sticks his hand.  Are you the chick that I ain't?  Come on, man. 
[02:36:00]  All right, Barb, thank you.  Oh, no problem.  All right.  Yeah, Barb, great radio bit, Barb.  Thanks.  Dave, shut up.  I love Dave.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I learned today that Blind Man's Package is sponsored by lifestyle condoms.  You guys suck.  Take care.  Rock on, Adam.  The extra large variety.  All right.  We're just about done. 
[02:36:30]  Wait, you're going to have her say something, Ray?  Oh.  Big party.  Oh, man.  Wait, say it.  What does she want to say?  What do you want to say?  Huh?  What do you want to say?  Privilege Gentleman's Club.  Pardon.  Big party tonight.  Shut up.  Dave, shut up.  Let the hot stripper talk.  Go ahead.  Start over.  Dije que se me olvidó lo que iba a decir.  Oh.  Would you say that and just kick me while I'm naked?  Dije que se me olvidó lo que iba a decir.  Oh.  Brr.  Nice. 
[02:37:00]  18.  Oh, yeah.  18 years old.  18.  JC.  Yo, man.  What's up?  Hey, thanks for the summit.  I just want to tell you what I learned, that blind, drunk guys busted up real quick.  Man, we are so out of dump, man.  Everyone cursing.  Everyone's cursing now at the end of the show.  Language.  You're leaving?  Wait, she wants to...  He told you to call this radio show.  All right, hold on.  He's gone, dude.  That's wrong, man.  It's wrong.  Wait, she needs to say something.  Everybody in the city and everywhere else, we're having a big, huge party today at Privilege. 
[02:37:30]  That's why we came out here, to harass you guys and to harass them, so everybody better  come down so we can molest everybody.  And Danny Kaye, big shout out.  All right, and it's Privileged Gentleman's Club, 23rd and 11th, and Chelsea.  Get red-eyed, Doug.  We'll take in a corner and let you know.  Quiet.  And Matt, Matt will show you.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Quiet.  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[02:38:00]  Shut up!  I'm not going to get nothing from my old lady.  Let's go to Pauly.  He's just a baffling idiot.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Pauly, what's up?  How's it going?  Yeah, I learned why blind Matt doesn't need a cane to find his way around.  Yeah.  And Privilege is the home of teen strippers.  That's right.  18.  Later, man.  Nice.  All right.  18.  She's looking all hot over there.  I know.  Woo!  She's looking hot to me, Opie.  That's a problem.  Yeah, the blind guy.  His eyes pop out.  No.  All right, we're not going to do that. 
[02:38:30]  Dude, pull him out again, man.  Dude, do it.  He can't really see you, though.  He's kind of like the electric company.  Yeah, he can.  Ladies, you want to see him pop out one eye?  Can I see it?  Do it.  Come on.  I want to touch it.  Do it.  Do it.  Matt, turn to your right.  Can I please see it?  You have a strong stomach.  Yeah.  She's trying to make it sound hot.  She's succeeding.  All right, this will be the grand finale.  You have a very tight stomach.  The only thing I'll do to show you that is if you bring three girls over here and feel  their breasts.  Do it.  Do it. 
[02:39:00]  Do it.  Do it.  You're making deals.  I know.  Jesus Christ.  We've got 30 seconds left.  Yeah, we've got 30 seconds.  Yeah, Robino.  Pop your eyes.  I said.  Robino, Robino.  Wait.

They're freaking out.  You like that?  100 bucks.  I'll give you 100 bucks if I can stick my mule in that.

Yes.  See?  It's just a credit to Sam Adams that the beer disappears so quick.  Cases at a time.  Gone.  People love it.  We do too.  Sam Adams.  It's a great American beer.  Yeah.  Jim Cook. 
[02:40:30]  He's the brains of the outfit.  He decided that people weren't into the watered-down beer anymore.  So he concocted Sam Adams.  And we love it.  It's great.  You want the lager?  You want the summer ale?  That's out now.  Great at the beach, ball game, wherever.  Wherever you're going, make it a Sam Adams like we do.  Mmm.  Say Sam Adams a couple of times.
