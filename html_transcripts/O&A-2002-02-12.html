<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-topic and characterized by crude humor, sexually explicit content, and offensive language.  A significant portion focused on a listener contest, "Naughty Nighty," featuring 98 female contestants, with the hosts providing commentary on their appearances and lack of engagement.  This segment included a humorous, albeit awkward, interaction with contestant Nikki.  The show also heavily featured discussions about HBO's *Oz*, with callers detailing graphic scenes of prison violence and sexual assault.

Technical difficulties at a New Orleans affiliate station dominated a considerable chunk of the show. The hosts spent much time criticizing the station manager, "Tom," for the outage, receiving calls from frustrated listeners, including a cab driver, Ricky, who offered to confront Tom.  This segment was punctuated by numerous sexually suggestive and offensive remarks.  The hosts also mocked Rosie O'Donnell's departure from her show using homophobic slurs and disparaged snowboarding as an Olympic sport,  further adding to the offensive tone with crude comments about a "fat Barbie" doll and obese people.  Listener calls contributed significantly to the vulgar and offensive nature of the discussions.

A substantial segment was dedicated to the online game EverQuest, referred to as "Evercrack" and "Widowmaker,"  with Anthony detailing his month-long addiction and the resulting computer upgrades,  and listeners sharing their own extensive playtime.  This segued into sexually explicit jokes and discussions about sex, relationships, and infidelity.  This part of the show featured multiple guests, including Tommy, whose pre-order of "State of Emergency" led to a cancelled meeting with Rockstar Games, and Nora Hayden, a New York Times bestselling author whose books, "How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time and Have Her Beg for More" and "How to Satisfy a Man Every Time and Have Him Beg for More," were repeatedly promoted. Hayden's appearance involved explicit conversations about sexual acts and techniques,  often employing crude and vulgar language, and including a segment where the hosts pressured her into performing a fake orgasm on air.   Audio of her actual moans from a previous sexual encounter was also played without her initial knowledge.  The segment included a caller, Christy, performing a "queef" on air, further escalating the showâ€™s explicit nature.  The hosts also discussed  an upcoming "55-gallon drum challenge" and their dissatisfaction with a previous meeting with Rockstar Games.  Further calls contributed to the sexually explicit content and included discussions about obesity.  A man claiming to work at Rikers Island and another claiming to be the CEO of Sing Sing also called in, adding to the overall chaotic and vulgar tone of the broadcast.  The show also briefly mentioned potential guests Bruce Willis and Triple H, although neither appeared on air during this broadcast.

The latest freak on the Opie and Anthony Show.  How you guys doing?  How you guys doing?  I'll get you anything you need. 
[00:01:00]  What do you need?  Anything.  God gonna come back next year.  Yeah, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Phones have exploded.  Let's go to them real fast before we get into some heavy-duty things today.  Ah, yeah.  Robert, what's going on, man?  Yeah, ONA.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, did you see Stephanie's nips on Raw last night?  Yeah, I think we all saw her.  Yeah.  I sent the pictures to foundrymusic.com so you can see it for yourself.  Some great still pictures of her nips just poking from her dress when she was mushed 
[00:01:30]  to the ground by Triple H.  Yeah, the Triple H-Stephanie McMahon marriage is officially over.  A lying bitch.  A lying bitch.  Ain't no good lying bitch.  Bitch.  Knocked her down, and then the boobies went flying everywhere.  We got close-ups of the nips.  That was after, in the back, Vince took quite the long gander right down his own daughter's 
[00:02:00]  cleavage.  Yeah, that was a little twisted, wasn't it?  Gonna walk my girl down that aisle.  And he just looks...  Take her off and take it off now.  He just looks at me down at his own daughter's pool.  At his own daughter's cancer.  She starts laughing.  Let me see those luscious cans, Stephanie.  Now take your blouse off.  Come on.  Take it off now.  Now.  Vince, it's your daughter.  He doesn't care. 
[00:02:30]  I'm wondering what color panties you're wearing tonight.  Vince, it's Stephanie.  She's your daughter.  Stop.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  Oh, that's terrible.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  Anyway, yeah, so she fell down and the dress went flying a little bit and you could see  the nip and...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  You know, Stephanie's a good friend of the show, but that boob job is ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  It's just ridiculous.  Well, you know something?  And I know there's going to come a time where we're going to have to remind us that we said  this on the air.  Remind ourselves.  Our listeners will.  I think Triple H, next time he comes in, will remind us.  I'm sure of it, but it's got to be said.  Her boob job, it makes them very big, but they needed to do some lifting.  Yeah, they're long.  Yeah.  They're still long.  She's got long... 
[00:03:30]  That's why girls, I guess, get breast implants.  Well, some, they just want bigger ones, but others, you know, they're sagging.  They want to, you know, push them all up and stuff.  Yeah, you got to kind of lift from the top or something, but hers, they're huge, but they're  long.  Steve, you get the clips of Stephanie's nips?  I sent them to you.  I will have them up shortly.  Foundrymusic.com.  Good Tim from Manhattan saying, hey, give us a one-day tally on the Hot Girls from Sacramento 
[00:04:00]  contest.  Well, Anthony, I can tell you one thing.  Yeah, Naughty Nighty contest, the voting has begun.  Yeah.  Go to opanthony.com.  You can vote every day.  Yeah, every day, once a day.  And we're going to narrow the 98 contestants that we have to 20 by next Monday.  And that's when the voting is going to get real serious, because we're going to have  thumbnails, so you can see all the girls on the screen at one time and really get into  it.  I'll tell you this much, 38,000 votes overnight, actually even more at this point, probably 
[00:04:30]  closer to 50, and the Sacramento girls doing very well in the contest.  Of course.  But not leading the contest.  How is that even?  You know.  Not leading the contest.  I don't believe it.  This is, uh, see, I don't want to give out numbers, because then we could really mess it  up.  No, no.  Don't give out any numbers.  All right.  I'm just going to look right now.  This girl is leading right here.  All right.  Let me see the corresponding number. 
[00:05:00]  Oh.  Right.  All right.  Let me get a look at that.  And she is leading, I'll tell you this much, one of the Sacramento girls.  It's close by 100 votes.  It's that close.  Close.  But it doesn't matter, because we're just looking for the top 20.  Right.  They're all, uh, in it.  I like the ones that actually got any votes.  I even said it in the office, I go, how are there, uh, girls that didn't get zero?  Well, some girls had to vote for themselves, right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[00:05:30]  One girl did get two votes overnight.  Two votes.  What?  No, Norton?  You're not, uh, you're not...  Don't say who it is, because we can't mess up the...  No, no.  The voting.  She's pretty, don't get me wrong, but...  Okay.  Is she in your top five?  No.  She's not even in your top five.  She's not in your top five?  No.  Your voting pattern would be completely different than anyone else's.  No.  You would go for a girl, it looks like she fell off the back of a garbage truck, it backed  up, ran her over, and then, uh, you'd think she was hot, kind of.  Right?  Right?  It's just the, the, the absolute lack of thinking and, and vulnerability I would like. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  No, no, no, I like hot chicks as much as the next person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  So go to opianthony.com.  Don't forget, you can vote every day.  Every day.  Every day.  I voted today.  I cast my ballot.  I voted today, and I voted yesterday for two different girls.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I was doing, too.  You gotta kind of vote for your top.  You gotta vote for your top, uh, well, the seven days of voting, so your top seven.  Your top seven.  Right.  If you're, cause it, it's for the final, well, if you're totally into one chick, I guess 
[00:06:30]  you would just, you wanna put her over the top?  Yeah.  If you wanna waste all seven of your votes.  There you go.  On one girl, that's, uh, something you could do as well, so.  All right.  Are there some that are just really floundering?  Give me, give me, let me see the, uh, sheet.  I wanna punch up somebody that's just, well, yeah, this, yeah, this one right here is floundering.  Okay, let me see, let me see real bad.  How many votes?  Uh, two.  Two votes.  That means she voted for herself and her mom voted.  Uh, let me see.  All right.  All right, let me see.  I gotta see the picture, cause I'm gonna punch the, uh, I just got numbers in front of  me. 
[00:07:00]  Two votes.  Uh, this number right here.  She is, oh, wait, there's another girl with only two votes.  Let me see.  Two votes.  Wait, wait, wait, uh, too far?  She's not bad.  What city is she from?  I can't tell from the banner.  I'm not gonna say.  Ooh.  Oh.  Hello, Cleveland!  Oh, stop.  That's all I'll say.  Who else?  And this one.  Dude, she's not bad.  Let me see.  This one also has only two votes.  All right.  Over here.  Let me look. 
[00:07:30]  Uh, let's see.  Oh, hey.  Gone.  She withdrew from the contest and still got, uh, as many votes as the girl from Cleveland.  Give me someone with, like, five or four votes, then.  I just like checking out the horror show.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Give me a number.  Yeah, here's, here's nine votes.  Nine votes.  Nine votes right there.  Let me see.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Okay.  Let me take a look.  What? 
[00:08:00]  All right.  Yeah, you know, I'm looking, but.  Turn it around.  Dude.  She only got nine votes?  I know.  That's like.  That's a surprise.  That doesn't make sense.  What about.  Here, here's one.  Here's one.  Here.  Uh, that one right there.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, let me tell you.  How many votes does she have?  Uh, six.  So, she must have a big family.  Let me see.  Hey, how many votes did this one get? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, uh, let me see.  What number is that?  She's doing okay, actually.  She's sexy.  Look at this girl.  Wait, turn around.  Is this the one that got six votes?  Dude, she is solid.  Why did she get six votes?  See, I don't understand some of the choices.  I think people are really piling on to their favorites and leaving out.  Uh, but, but how many did she get at this?  Uh, she's got, um, almost 200 votes.  Stop it.  Swear to God.  Holy Christ, man. 
[00:09:00]  I don't understand you people.  All right, enough of this, because people are going to get bored with us.  Just basically, uh, keep in mind, you can vote every day.  As we narrow it down to 20.  Uh, next Monday, we'll, we'll be down to 20 girls.  Okay?  Wrong.  Go to opandanthony.com.  Damn.  Rob wants in.  Rob, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  What do you have, man?  Oh, Ernie.  Wait a minute.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Two seconds.  Ernie from Jersey.  That's exactly who we were just talking about.  200 votes.  Ernie was like, come on, dude.  And then gives a number.  Even get one vote? 
[00:09:30]  I was stunned myself, Ernie from Jersey.  She's got a cute face.  And, uh, Dan from Hoboken.  Same thing.  See?  Everyone's commenting.  I'm like, she's got a cute face.  Stop it.  Rob, you're, what's up, man?  All right, listen.  With eyes, okay?  As far as eyes.  Look, I'm not, don't get me wrong.  It's like the best show.  But you remember, you, you remember it like.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We went out of our way to get the music.  Come on, give us some.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  I can just hear the screams of the gang rape now.  All right, uh, what's up, Rob?  Yeah.  All right.  We all saw Oz.  All right, this was the gayest episode yet.  I mean, there was some cool stuff that happened.  But when, like in The Sopranos, the biggest hype was who's going to get whacked next.  Yeah.  This show's basically gotten to be like, who's going to take it in the balloon that night?  You know what I mean?  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the AIDS, fellas.  It's getting pretty gay.  Well, you know what?  It's just part of the prison life that we all must avoid at all costs. 
[00:10:30]  Boy, if that show isn't like scared straight.  I don't care if the reality of it is one one billionth of what they're showing on this goddamn show, Oz.  But that's enough of a risk that I will never do anything illegal.  Last week, if you remember, Rob, a couple of young men were incarcerated in Oz for raping a woman.  Raping a girl. 
[00:11:00]  And they were these middle class white guys, upper teens, lower 20s, it seemed like.  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Well, that's what they were saying.  I mean, they were very happy about the rape they had pulled.  One of them was this blonde-haired kid, very slender.  And he goes in.  And instantly, the Nazis, like, grab him, put him in pigtails, make him wear lipstick and eye makeup and a tight t-shirt and hot pants and just instantly made him a bitch. 
[00:11:30]  The other guy gets the protection of, what's his name, Ben?  It looks like I'm a rat.  It's in the hole.  The gay guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the gay guy.  God, it slips my mind.  But he gets the protection of this guy.  And then just proceeds, Beecher, and then just proceeds to, like, crap on him.  Not literally, but that's happened, too, on this show.  And just, like, really screws with him.  And Beecher just turns on him. 
[00:12:00]  Says, all right, screw it.  He's yours.  Gives him to the Nazis.  And they just throw him in this stock room.  And the one, his buddy there that had already been railed with the pigtails goes, can I watch?  And Schillinger goes, how else are you going to learn?  And they just, they ravaged him like they showed him at the end on the gymnasium floor.  And he's got claw marks in his shoulders.  They're just grabbing him and plowing him.  He's all beat to hell.  It was a mess.  He got told. 
[00:12:30]  Someone else got their arm cut off in that episode.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think you're right, though.  It's getting to be, like, who's going to get banged?  Who's going to get nailed in the man?  Exactly.  It's horrid.  Hi, Rob.  Hi, Rob.  It's a horrid show.  There's your Oz update for this week.  Oz.  Da-da-da-da.  Huh!  All right.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up?  What's up, Anthony?  Can I ask you a personal question?  Uh, sure.  When you ended your marriage, did you pedigree your mother-in-law? 
[00:13:00]  And I could have sworn, uh, Vince McMahon said, get me a box of wine.  He was on the mat.  What are you doing?  Why are you putting me in the pedigree?  I don't understand.  Ouch.  My arms don't go like that.  Don't plow my face into the...  Ow!  They screwed up the hole, too, right before they did it, if you noticed that.  Box of wine.  Yeah, no, unfortunately, things don't go like they do in the WWF.  I'll put some!  I'll put some! 
[00:13:30]  All right, Doug.  There you go.  My name!  Ray works at Rikers Island.  Oz is wrong.  Ray, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I work at Rikers Island.  They show way too much man junk, and that, that, the scooting around don't happen all  the time.  Well, that's, it's fine.  It's just, uh, it's a, it's a sick, sick show, and like I said, if, if one billionth  of it is true, it should keep everybody out of, out of prison.  Yeah, it's, I hear what you're saying, but it's just, nah, not, not that much. 
[00:14:00]  Well, hold on.  We got a CEO from, uh, Sing Sing is saying that the stories, oh, dad is CEO at Sing Sing,  stories he tells worse than Oz.  Pete, what's up?  Pete, what's up, guys?  Yeah, my dad was a corrections officer in Sing Sing for like 20 years, and like, dude,  Oz is like, it's a guy's soap opera, and it's really stupid.  My dad will come home telling me like, the craziest stories, like, they don't have makeup  and all that stuff, like, dude, my dad will come home late and be like, yeah, someone got  stabbed today, like, people get stabbed every day, like, people get killed and raped, 
[00:14:30]  but it's not like, it's not like a soap opera like that.  Dude, that show is so stupid.  Well, they gotta make it like a soap opera.  They're not like a soap opera.  They're not like a soap opera.  It's a funny show.  You're just watching it.  Yeah, it is funny.  The violence is great to watch.  What they use for makeup, they use Kool-Aid as lipstick.  That's their lipstick.  Yeah, you guys, like, it's such BS.  Like, every time I watch that, my dad's like, this ain't true, that's not true.  I don't care.  It's true enough.  Yeah, it's horrific.  You ever seen the HBO special?  It's horrific. 
[00:15:00]  You ever seen the HBO special they did on Rikers Island?  No.  That was good.  Yeah.  That's the real thing, man.  That was done in my jail.  That was done in my jail.  The documentaries, and then your drama shows.  Yeah, but it's like a guy's soap opera.  It's like Days of Our Lives in prison.  Oh, yeah, it's just like Days of Our Lives.  It is.  It is.  Yeah, I remember Stefano Demira plowing John Black in the balloon knot.  That's what the other guy said.  Now you're wondering who's going to get pulled over in a balloon knot.  John Black. 
[00:15:30]  Bend over, John Black.  I'm going to plow you like I want to plow Marlena.  I am Stefano Demira, and I will F you, John Black.  A little prison lube for you.  You have got in the way of my plans too many times, John Black.  Where is Austin?  I will ask him for a BJ.  Why do I sound like Dracula? 
[00:16:00]  It's close.  It's close.  So far front.  Doug wants to comment about the girl that got two votes in the Noti 90 contest so far.  Yes, Doug.  Yeah, I was just saying, it's not that she had her mother in her vote.  It was called yesterday and today.  Oh, that's true.  Yes, she voted yesterday, voted today.  I didn't think anyone could make it sound worse, but Doug just did.  Two votes.  Thanks, Doug.  Thank you.  Sorry about that.  Rusty.  Hey, Brad, what's up?  Guys, did you notice last night on SmackDown when Vince agreed to walk Stephanie down the 
[00:16:30]  aisle, he was checking her out up and down and literally looked right down her top.  Yeah, so he said when we first got out.  Yeah, that was the first thing we said today.  It was really sick.  Walk my little girl down the aisle.  And then he just glanced down her cleavage.  Because he can't help it either.  He's like, holy, yes, those are huge.  Anyway, that's it.  Thanks, guys.  Vince never disappoints.  The guy is consistently hysterical.  He's on all the time.  His face is when Triple H called her a lying bitch. 
[00:17:00]  His face, when he gets the big eyes and looks around like, oh, didn't see this one coming.  You know, and they're all such bad actors, but it's hysterical.  Very funny to watch.  Vince.  All right.  Adam, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  When can we get some more of them clips of Tom in New Orleans?  We're working on the latest clips from Tom.  Yeah, that's great.  He's got to keep running that.  You like those, right?  Yeah, they're good.  They're real good. 
[00:17:30]  Did you hear the second batch?  I don't think so, no.  Go to the second batch.  We added those late in the show yesterday.  Oh, really?  Tom, the guy that runs, it looks like a couple stations down there in New Orleans.  Jeez.  And he was a mess and in our face the whole time we were at Mardi Gras.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick, we working on more Tom clips?  Oh, boy.  Hey, that's great.  All right, we'll get them on, Adam.  Norton, I need to know any way I can come see in Philly.  It's at TLA.  I don't know.  YSP might be giving away tickets, but I know tickets go on sale on Friday. 
[00:18:00]  Friday?  Yeah, thanks, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Are your tour dates somewhere yet?  They will be up on my website probably tonight or tomorrow.  Probably tomorrow.  Is that eatabullet.com?  I wouldn't plug that gratuitously.  What's the matter with you?  No, probably tomorrow I'll put them up.  All right.  They're on foundrymusic.com as well.  All right, Ant.  Why don't we take a break?  And the only reason I know anything about Days of Our Lives, I've talked about this,  because now I'm getting hammered.  I'll just wait until the figure skating conversation comes up. 
[00:18:30]  Next.  I might as well put on the Oz little bippy shirt and lipstick and pigtails.  What?  What?  What?  Norton?  Your cute little porn star t-shirt.  Why?  No, I said that because of the working hours years ago when we were up in Massachusetts.  I lived right by the radio station.  I didn't have to leave until 2.30.  Don't feel like you have to explain.  No, I'm just saying.  A lot of guys, I know this happens to a lot of guys.  When you get caught up in a work schedule where you have a lot of afternoon television, 
[00:19:00]  sometimes you find yourself a soap opera.  You sure do.  I'm doing comedy 12 years and I haven't had to work during the day and I have never watched a soap opera.  When are you going to realize that you are so far from the norm on anything that it's like,  well, let me tell you what I do.  Did you watch the Olympics?  I slice her from the throat down to the lower abdomen and pull the guts on out before I have it.  It's like, all right, he makes it sound so normal.  Did you watch the Olympics last night, Jim? 
[00:19:30]  I certainly didn't.  Well, see.  Of course not.  Why should you?  I'm working on material.  Why should you do a show for 18 cities?  Nah, a bunch of dumb foreigners doing teen tricks.  I'm not interested.  Because none of our listeners watched the Olympics last night and they're now waiting for us to comment and go find it.  Sure.  They probably are, but you know what?  I have no interest in the Olympics.  I think they're stupid.  Opie, I watched the Olympics.  And we're going to talk about it next.  Yes.  Okay?  Also, Anthony, today we've got to start talking about the 55-gallon drum challenge. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  Because as soon as the Naughty Nighty contest wraps up, we're going to do the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Yes.  Hulk, shouldn't we call it the 110-gallon drum challenge since it's the second one?  So we're going to talk about the Winter Olympics next.  So close in those barrels, it might get someone pregnant.  Right, Steve?  And call back.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:30]  Where's that anthrax?  That's going to make a sweeper.  Where's the kaboom?  And he double...  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got to go to cab driver Ricky in New Orleans real fast, Anthony.  All right.  There may be a problem in New Orleans today.  Ricky, what's up? 
[00:21:00]  Yo, what's happening, yo?  You tell me.  All right.  I'm going to turn on the ONA show for 2 o'clock.  And I hear this.  You hear this?  You're stuck.  I can't hear y'all, man.  The only way I can hear y'all is through my phone.  What is that?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Did that drunk Tom forget to turn on the radio station today?  That's what I think.  Drunk Tom.  I forgot the on switch.  Someone get drunk Tom on the phone. 
[00:21:30]  How you guys doing?  I forgot to turn the station on.  You know, I know that cab driver Ricky is telling the truth.  Because when we got picked up at the airport, when we went down there for Mardi Gras,  we're like, hey, we're in New Orleans.  Let's check out the station we're on.  Let's check it out.  I'm excited.  What did we get?  Static.  I go, Tom, your station's off the air.  He goes, yeah, I don't know what's going on.  I don't know what the problem is.  I'm like, aren't you in charge?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You might need some cocaine. 
[00:22:00]  All right, turn on the station again.  Let's hear it.  All right.  I got it on full blast right now.  Man, there's our signal in New Orleans today.  There you go.  Listen to New Orleans.  There you go.  Great.  It's hard enough to get ratings, you know.  We need the station to at least be heard.  I'm probably the only black listener.  No, we got plenty of...  We got the brothers listening.  We like the brothers.  Yeah, it was because of me telling them. 
[00:22:30]  All right, Ricky.  Thank you.  Yeah, I do.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  Thank you.  Tom, your radio station's not on.  My bad.  Yeah, your bad.  My bad.  That guy's out of his mind.  No surprise that he forgot to turn on the station today.  Because I guess they don't have a lot of personalities yet on this station in New Orleans.  Yeah.  Playing a lot of rock and stuff, and they got us in afternoons.  And I guess when we're not on the air, they got to remember to keep the station on. 
[00:23:00]  They got to remember to turn it on.  And to actually turn it on.  Ben?  That's great.  What's going on?  Tom's in a meeting.  Tom's on a client meeting.  Do they realize that the station might not be on the air in New Orleans today?  Does anyone realize?  I don't know.  Nikki, what's up?  Hi.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  You're contestant number 69 in the Naughty Nighty contest.  What can we do for you?  Yeah, I just wanted to call to say hi and see how everything was going with the contest. 
[00:23:30]  You're trying to get some info from us.  Dude, how many votes does this number have?  Wait a minute.  Well, I don't care how many I have.  I'll put those numbers together.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  Nikki, hold on a sec.  I've got to help out in.  Oh, that's this.  How many votes?  Oh, a lot.  Not many.  29 votes.  Nikki, you're doing...  You're doing...  29 more than...  Nikki, I can tell you this much.  You're doing fine in the contest. 
[00:24:00]  Let me see, Nikki.  What number is she?  Nikki is number 69, Anthony.  Let me go down as 69.  Nikki, you're doing just fine.  One of the Sacramento girls.  Now, remember the vote...  It's very early in the voting.  We're encouraging people to vote every day for the Naughty Nighty contest on opianthony.com.  You have to vote every day?  Yeah.  Yeah, because we're trying to narrow it down to 20.  So, there's a lot of guys out there and girls that don't really know who they're going to vote for in the end.  And they got a few faves.  So, this is a way of getting all their votes counting in the preliminaries.  Turn it around, Ant. 
[00:24:30]  All righty.  I want to remember what she looked...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Nikki, you're doing just fine.  Let me see this.  The total.  I won't say anything.  Right there.  Nikki, I'll tell you this much.  If the voting ended today in the preliminaries, you would make the top 20.  No problem.  How's that?  Oh, good.  That's wonderful.  No problem.  How about this?  You would make the top 10.  No problem.  And we better stop there.  All right?  Okay.  And when is the last...  Nikki, Nikki, all right, you're one of the Sacramento girls? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  Uh-huh.  Hmm.  Why?  Name one thing we have done on the radio show.  I don't know.  I don't listen very often because I go to work at 3 o'clock.  Oh, boy.  Just sometimes when I don't have to work.  Ah, so what, Opie?  What's the big deal?  We'll make it very easy for you.  Just name one thing we've done.  We've been on in Sacramento almost eight months now, I think.  Just one thing.  Okay, so I don't listen very often.  Very often.  How often would you say you listen to this show? 
[00:25:30]  Maybe, maybe once or twice a week because I have to work at 3 o'clock.  All right.  All right.  What's one thing you've heard during one of those...  You guys come on in my town.  All right.  So how about you name one thing we did, I don't know, last week.  Just anything you've heard on the show.  I haven't listened last week.  I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  Name one thing you've ever heard during any of your times listening to the show.  Because we really would like to think that someone as hot as you is listening to this  radio show.  So just name one thing.  Just one little thing.  I don't know. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, man.  How about I listen from...  How about I listen today?  Any, anything.  How about one thing we did today?  I haven't...  It just isn't on yet.  Nick, Nicky?  It comes on at 3.  Nicky, Nicky?  Nicky.  Could you be completely honest with us and say that you have never, ever listened to  this show?  No, I've heard it before.  Just not before things.  What did you hear that time you heard it?  I don't remember.  She is hot, Obie, so her mind probably could be a little...  How about one thing we did yesterday? 
[00:26:30]  That's not nice.  One thing we did yesterday.  I didn't listen to you guys yesterday.  How about this?  Recently, Opie and Anthony did a...  You guys.  Hold on, hold on.  Recently, Opie and Anthony went on a road trip.  Matter of fact, Opie and Anthony went on three road trips the last three Fridays.  Name one of the cities we broadcast it from.  I work on Fridays at 3 o'clock.  I don't get to listen to your show.  Oh, boy.  It comes on at 3 o'clock.  This is so typical because we were just gawking over you and your pictures and you don't  even have a clue who the hell we are.  It's our life all over again.  All right, Nicky, how about this? 
[00:27:00]  What?  It's the Opie and Anthony show and there is a special person that sits in with us a lot.  I don't know.  I just wanted to see how the contest was going.  I don't want to play trivia.  A lot of people would even say he's like the third member of the show now.  What's his name?  I don't know.  What's our producer's name?  Your producer's name?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How would I know that?  Name one other person involved with the Opie and Anthony show.  No, I don't want to play you guys' game.  I just wanted to see how the contest was doing. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  I hope people are taking this under consideration.  Oh, my goodness.  That has nothing to do with the contest.  Well, she's right there, Opie.  I'm just saying I hope people take this under consideration.  That's all.  You can't hate me for your guys' shows come on too late in the afternoon.  It doesn't have to be at work.  Sometimes girls call and it helps their cause.  And other times, well, maybe it's going to hurt their cause.  That's all I'm saying.  I don't know.  What station does it air on in Sacramento?  Well, if me not listening to this show doesn't make my pictures any worse. 
[00:28:00]  What station does it air on in Sacramento?  93-7.  Yeah, with the call letters?  Is it KXA?  Uh-huh.  Is it?  Can you name one other city we are on in?  Oh, my God.  Aren't you on all of them?  No.  Wow.  She said no ones, but that's what we were just talking about before we picked her up.  All right, Nikki.  Oh, wow.  She stopped giving me a hard time.  Oh, look how hot she is in the pictures. 
[00:28:30]  And she just doesn't even have a clue who the hell we are.  All right, Nikki.  Contestant number 69, everyone.  There she is, Nikki.  I'm just saying.  Thank you.  Contestant number 69.  You guys stop.  That's what they do with my pictures.  All right.  Well, have a good day.  Okay, thank you.  There goes, Nikki.  Bye.  I want to hear from some of these other beauties from Sacramento.  Natalie.  Hello.  Contestant number 34 from Sacramento.  Let me punch her picture up here.  Hey, you guys.  Don't give Nikki a hard time. 
[00:29:00]  She's a doll face.  I know her personally.  And it's true.  She works days.  All right.  I will say that I listen almost every day.  You guys just got back from New Orleans.  Yes.  Did you guys really pull that BJ off of that girl?  Yeah, we did.  Okay, and wow.  How about the Boston thing and the clam chowder?  Yeah.  No, we really do believe that you listen to this.  Yeah.  Trust me.  We believe you.  We believe you. 
[00:29:30]  If you're listening out there, do the math.  Nikki was busy with me anyways that day.  She couldn't pay attention to anything else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does she do for a living?  What's that?  What does she do for a living?  She's an entertainer part-time.  I think she does something else also.  What kind of entertainer?  Tell the truth.  What type of entertainment?  Oh, I'm...  Is she a stripper or a model?  She's quite the little entertainer.  Stripper or model or escort?  One of the three.  She's a model, I believe.  Okay, figures.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Well, I mean, obviously, you guys can tell by her picture.  She's beautiful.  Doesn't matter. 
[00:30:00]  A lot of hot girls aren't anorexic models.  Yeah.  Very true.  There's a lot of real listeners out there that are very sexy.  Not that I wouldn't bang her.  Believe me, I'd stab my family to get to Nikki.  Hey, stand in line.  For the people that are listening at home, number 69 does not listen to the Opie and Anthony  show.  Number 34 does.  Do the math.  All right.  Thank you, Natalie.  You're welcome.  Hey, guys.  Good luck in the contest, all right?  Well, thank you.  I just wanted to kind of just say hi and see how things are going.  But can you guys truly track those, the votes? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're actually letting that information out right now?  Not really.  No, we're not letting it out.  We're doing a little.  We're hinting a little bit.  That's all.  Yeah?  So do I get a hint?  Do you really want a hint?  Well, you know, I have heard a lot of bad publicity.  And, you know, actually, it's probably done us better.  We've done us good.  Let's just put it this way, Natalie.  No, let's be real, guys.  Do you have a large family?  Do I have a large family? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I have a lot of friends.  All right.  Do you own luggage?  Do you own luggage?  I have to own luggage.  Absolutely.  All right.  Well, you can loan it out.  Not fair.  I can loan it out.  Okay.  So that was a big enough hint.  No, you're doing just fine.  Okay.  We can't give away too much.  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel you guys.  I just want to say hi.  It's been a while since we spoke.  Yeah, Natalie.  You know, and I was kind of...  All right.  I'm a little upset that I didn't get more of girlfriends that I'm friends with to come 
[00:31:30]  and help contribute to this.  All right.  But God, I can't believe how much it's progressed over just a short matter of time.  Yeah, such a thing.  Natalie?  Yes?  We have to move on to our next caller.  Okay.  Sounds good, guys.  All righty.  Thank you, Natalie.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  We don't have a next caller, do we?  No, we don't.  Oh, God.  God, we really thought that we were moving up.  I thought...  You know something?  I should smack myself in the head for even thinking for a second. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sitting there at home looking at some of these beauties going, look at, whoa, look  at the type of woman listening to us now that we've been sitting there.  Picturing her hair blowing in the wind in her convertible, cans hanging out, O&A blasting  on the radio.  Her boobs jiggling as she's laughing at something we may have said or done on the show.  No.  No.  No.  No.  We suck.  Know who listens to us?  Number blank who looks like Andy Dick. 
[00:32:30]  Two vote girl.  Two vote girl.  Two vote girl.  We're cranked up right now.  Hi, two vote girl.  Hi.  Enjoying the show?  Of course you are.  You never tune away.  Two vote girl.  Model girl, you know what she's listening to?  God damn dance music.  Well, that's what strippers listen to.  We were so, so stupid. 
[00:33:00]  Hot chicks don't have time to listen to us.  We are stupid even thinking that she was a listener.  Rick, I hate to tell you this, but when 69 called in, that was the best reverse cringe  radio I ever heard.  I mean, if it's any consolation, I know who you guys are.  We're just begging for her to know anything about us or the show and nothing.  No.  Not a thing.  She didn't know Norton.  Because we've heard rumors that, you know, hot chicks enjoy a good sense of humor. 
[00:33:30]  So we're thinking, yeah, yeah.  What is a girl like better than anything else?  Well, a sense of humor is a must for the one with two votes.  Because for Nikki, I think something like a fat wallet and a fat something else.  Hey, she's still on the line, Ant.  She ain't listening.  She's still taking another call.  Yeah, all right.  See you guys later.  Thanks, Rich.  Yeah, we knew how that was going to end.  But we were hoping against hope. 
[00:34:00]  Now all I can think now as I scan through some of these other hotties.  Not a clue.  Nope.  Not a goddamn clue.  I don't know.  I think the blonde listens to us.  Who?  Anna?  Anna.  No way.  No way.  What about the other one that just checked in, Daniela?  Number 93 from Sacramento the other day.  Look at this.  See that?  Turn around.  Look at it.  Remember her?  Remember her?  Yeah.  You think she listens to us? 
[00:34:30]  No!  Absolutely not.  No.  No.  Here she is listening to O&A.  Leaning back with her cans hanging out.  And her head with the dreamy look in her eye.  Well, that's the most enjoyable way to listen to the show.  Of course it is.  For the two vote girl.  Andy Dick.  Andy Dick.  How sad was that, man? 
[00:35:00]  That was pathetic.  I felt like I was back in high school again.  That was pathetic.  Thinking I had enough going to ask the hot chick out.  Yeah.  Nothing.  See?  Nothing.  High.  I know.  Or how about you're in junior high, right?  High school.  And you see the hot chick all the time.  Like, oh, she obviously notices me because I'm noticing her.  Yeah.  Look how beautiful she is.  Right.  That's it.  You're in class.  You're looking at her.  All of a sudden, your delusional effing mind is thinking, she's looking at me.  Yeah.  I think she gave me an eye or something. 
[00:35:30]  There was something going on that would lead me to believe that she wants me to walk up and ask her out or just start a conversation.  So, yeah, so you get the butterflies.  Finally, you're going to do it.  It takes weeks.  It takes weeks.  But in those weeks, you're just getting more reinforcement that this girl is a kind of into you.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  I think she just smiled at me.  Yeah, of course.  Then your dopey friends might have talked to a friend's friend of a friend.  Oh, yeah.  She takes you.  Oh, my lunchroom.  It's great, yeah.  My lunchroom, you're hanging with the guys and you go, what do you guys think? 
[00:36:00]  Look, she's over there.  Yeah.  Dude, I think you might be right.  You might be on to something.  Follow her home with a gun.  Then what?  Then you get the nerve up and you approach her and you realize, oh, my God, she has no clue I'm alive.  Who?  Why?  What class?  Oh, my God.  What school?  What?  Oh, my God.  That's exactly what happened.  Oh, you're in my math class?  Oh, really?  Really?  Brought it right back.  Oh, do you sit two rows in front and to the right?  No.  No, that's not me. 
[00:36:30]  No, no, no, not at all.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  They're all going to laugh at us.  Laugh away.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks.  Just chuckle.  Yeah.  I enjoyed putting ourselves out there, though.  I just knew what the answer was going to be. 
[00:37:00]  We put ourselves out there.  We talked her up so much.  Dude, I've always, always been tortured by attractive women.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Never in heights.  I was a virgin when I was 18.  I was in love with a girl named Michelle, and I finally asked her out senior year.  I called her on the phone.  That's the way a real man asks a girl out.  He gets her number from a friend and calls her.  And I'm like, oh, wait.  We have her answer here.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh? 
[00:37:30]  I asked her out.  I'm like, you know, I am the worst.  I'm like, you don't want to go out with me or anything, do you?  Oh, yeah.  That's how I asked her out.  Make it sound fun.  And she's like, no, I don't think so.  Oh.  Oh.  That is so lame.  And I tried to cover up with a little joke.  I figured, I said, oh, well, I guess that's the way the ball crumbles. 
[00:38:00]  I was two seconds away from this on this phone call to her.  Don't you do it.  Don't.  You.  I got nowhere else to go.  That's how I felt.  Don't you.  God, we were all hoping for a little glimmer.  A little glimmer of hope there.  Like, oh, she's going to know something.  Something.  She'll know something. 
[00:38:30]  Nothing, Opie.  Nothing.  Nothing.  She has never heard a peep of this program.  Nothing.  Are we straight on this now?  Nothing.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, well.  What were we thinking, though?  Did you actually think for a second?  I think, well, for a moment there, we thought we were rock stars.  Yeah.  I think we needed that to happen to us, Ant.  Oh, brought us back down earth. 
[00:39:00]  That's right.  Great.  That's good.  It was really a nice thought, though, that she'd be listening while she was doing cocaine  and making herself vomit.  Hey.  Michelle.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I knew the answer of, you know, of the contact when you asked, you know, who is  the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello?  Oh.  If this doesn't just prove our point, the hot, hot chick has no clue who we are, but Michelle, 
[00:39:30]  the girl that sounds retarded on the phone knows everything.  Are you about to set off a bomb on yourself in Tel Aviv?  No, I don't, you know, but I wouldn't mind if she would squeeze my tummy.  That's that chick from Mad TV, right?  You ever see that bit?  No, I'm not.  She goes over the counter.  I like a cup of coffee.  This is how you...  I know the answer.  This is how you really talk, Michelle?  Yeah.  Where are you from?  I'm French.  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  I'm French.  You're French?  Yeah.  You don't sound French. 
[00:40:00]  All right, what do you know about the Opie and Anthony show?  I listen...  Watch her just rattle off things.  I listen every day.  Every day?  Yeah, every afternoon.  I'm a big fan.  Who's the comic that sits in with us?  Jimmy.  All right, who's our producer?  Ricky.  Where are you from?  I'm French.  You're from the South...  You're not from France.  New York.  I'm in Westchester.  You're from Westchester?  I mean, I'm not born in America. 
[00:40:30]  I'm born in France.  You don't sound French.  Yeah.  Name the three cities we recently went to.  You even had French here on, you know.  He has the regular French accent.  I don't.  All right, name the three cities we broadcasted to recently.  You went to Philadelphia?  You went to Cleveland?  Well, not Cleveland.  No, no, no.  You went to...  Oh, geez.  All right, thank you.  I'm listening every day.  You know something?  We don't doubt that for a second. 
[00:41:00]  We're talking.  Are you hot?  You know what?  Tom from New Orleans might be on to something.  I think we could get better ratings if we just have static, because no one's listening.  I know.  I'm not listening.  You know, it was so much...  This girl listens every day and still can't figure it out.  It was so noisy.  You're sure that you did in New Orleans?  I just didn't like it.  All right.  It was like, you know, I love the Saturday show.  I loved it when you had, you know, that guy from the life of the rich and famous.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Michelle. 
[00:41:30]  Who's talking?  Andy from Boston saying, dude, in high school I had this wicked crush, wicked crush dude,  for about three years on this chick.  And one day I talked to her little brother.  He said, she talks about you all the time.  Then before my D can even get a little stiff, he said, yeah, she hates your guns.  That's it.  It's just thrown to the wayside.  All right.  Why don't we, why don't we...  They don't understand the humiliation.  Women don't get that in high school. 
[00:42:00]  They don't understand what it's like to have a crush and have them not like it.  And they wonder why you buy a shovel when you're 30.  Some lime.  Got to line that hole with lime.  Well, you put jelly all over the body so the animals take care of the evidence.  Well, I'm just speculating.  So make sure you vote every day for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  OpenAnthony.com.  All right.  We're going to take a break in.  We're going to talk about the Winter Olympics next.  Yes.  And the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, we got hissing cockroaches?  You know what?  We'll play that after the break.  We got a clip from the first 55-gallon drum challenge.  We finally found the hissing cock roaches.  I said roaches.  A little pause there.  That's all right.  A little pause.  I finished.  Cockroaches.  I finished.  And if I didn't ant did, so.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  Let me adjust my tie and type this out.  Are you ribbing us?  Oh, golly. 
[00:43:00]  Good gravy.  Jeepers, creepers.  Look at me, Pete.  How racist.  Oh, my God.  Oh, brother.  Don't f**k yourself.  Tasteless, offensive.  I need drugs.  Sucks on a daily basis.  White pussy boy suburban humor.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Aren't we supposed to be trained to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The Opie and Anthony show.

No.  Please.  The voting continues.  You've got to vote every single day as we narrow the 98 down to 20 by Monday.  Pop, pop, pop.  Go to opianthony.com.  Taylor, contestant number 79.  What's going on?  Nothing.  How are you guys?  Hey. 
[00:45:00]  Do you listen to our show?  Yes, I do.  Do you enjoy a sense of humor?  Yes, I do.  How long have you been listening for?  Actually, probably a couple weeks, honestly.  That's when you got your pictures taken.  No, it wasn't.  It was before that.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Because, you know, Taylor's hot too.  What's something you heard on the show that maybe tickled your funny bone? 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to say the bit what you guys do with the what have I learned today.  The end of the show.  All right.  Okay.  She likes the most obvious bit.  What did we learn today?  How about something a little more obscure?  A little more what?  Obscure.  Yeah.  Like a single moment, not just a thing that we do every day.  No.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know either.  At least I'm being honest.  You know, sure, honesty is the best policy.  It is.  Do you know the third guy that does the show with us?  Would that be Norton?  Okay.  Oh.  Okay.  Well, we'll give her a little ringy-dingy for that one.  Thank you.  Taylor, you're doing fine in the contest.  Am I?  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Is Norton voting for me or what?  I have not voted yet.  You've got to vote every day.  Norton, I will do whatever it takes to get your vote, my dear. 
[00:46:30]  What town do you live in?  Philly.  You're in Philly.  What town?  I'm right outside of Philly.  Oh, good.  Well, we can make an arrangement then to get my one vote.  Your one vote.  All right.  Thank you, Taylor.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  We've got someone checking in from New Orleans.  Let's see if the station's on.  Regina.  Yeah.  Can you hear us today?  Well, actually, I'm in Philadelphia right now.  Oh.  And that's the only reason I can even listen to you guys, because the radio station there 
[00:47:00]  in New Orleans, you can never get it on.  Interesting.  You mean to say when you try to listen in New Orleans, for some reason the station is not  on?  It's horrible.  It's like I can get the reception sometimes in my car and that's it.  All right, Regina.  Well, well.  But I'm in Philly right now, and yesterday you guys were great.  The stories about broadcasting from New Orleans was hilarious.  And the view, that was great for y'all to watch that, because I was laughing so hard.  Thank you, Regina. 
[00:47:30]  We got Tom from New Orleans on the phone.  Oh, thank God.  Good.  Give him the fix it.  We'll get to the bottom of this.  Now, I'm starting to get the feeling that Tom from New Orleans is a stalker, and that  we're not on a station in New Orleans.  You don't think we are?  No.  All right.  Because we were down there, and the station was off the air the whole time we were there,  Anthony.  Did you actually go to the station at any point?  No.  I asked to.  You did?  I swear.  Because, you know, I'm like a...  Yeah, you like the whole industry.  I'm a radio freak.  So I'm like, oh, all right.  I'd like to check out the station we're on.  Interesting.  And they're like, oh, no. 
[00:48:00]  You don't want to go there.  I didn't go to the station either.  Oh, no.  You don't want to go there.  Huh.  Why not?  We take pride in the radio stations we're on.  Hmm.  Tom?  It's one of the nicest facilities you've ever seen, especially from New Orleans standards.  It's on St. Charles.  It's beautiful.  We're having a little technical problem today.  What is the...  What's the technical problem we're having?  Did a drunk engineer shit off a switch?  Did you spill your beer?  Did your cooler overturn on the console? 
[00:48:30]  No.  It's a little technical problem.  We're getting it corrected right now.  But you can hear the station fine.  What happened?  We heard the station the whole time on the way to your hotel in the limo.  No, we didn't.  No, we didn't.  It wasn't on.  You put on the competition because we don't know the difference, and they're playing, like,  it sounded like okay music, so...  Remember?  Yeah, here's the station.  The only thing I heard was that one song, Make Norton Want to Kill Himself. 
[00:49:00]  Remember?  It wasn't on.  It was on all day today and all morning, so...  Liar!  So, what's the problem with today?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not the engineer, man.  I'm told that it's being taken care of as we speak.  I'm not the engineer, man.  Wouldn't you stand over him until it was taken care of?  Tim Sabian in Philly would do that.  I mean, I...  Edipus in Boston would do that.  Okay.  Let me get out there and get him.  Ken Stevens would take a whip to Pete's ass up here in New York if that happened. 
[00:49:30]  He probably would, huh?  Yeah.  You're just assuming that the problem's going to be taken care of.  How long have you been off the air?  About 2.30.  Liar!  Liar!  Just before our show.  Hmm.  I would think we should be on the air.  I would definitely think you should be on the air.  Yeah.  Does this bother you, Tom?  Very much so.  Sounds it.  My bad.  Very much so.  Well, you didn't hear me about, let's say, 40 minutes ago. 
[00:50:00]  Do you realize we're having one of the best radio shows ever today and no one in New Orleans is hearing it?  And that sucks.  We already gave out the cure for AIDS.  Did you?  I guess nobody in New Orleans is going to know that now.  Yeah.  We're a little bit behind in everything anyway.  Yeah.  I hear you.  All right, Tom.  All right, guys.  Why don't we work on the energy a little bit?  I'll be a huckleberry.  Why don't you go do some skating and get your energy up so you can go take care of the problem. 
[00:50:30]  Dude, I just need to sleep for about two days is what I need to do.  All right.  All right.  All right, Tom.  All right, bye, Tom.  Later.  Bye, later.  Thanks for the support.  Later.  There he is.  He's in charge.  You thought we were making all this up yesterday.  He sounded like a different Tom, didn't he?  That guy sounds dead.  You want to get Tim Sabian on the phone so you can hear how a guy is supposed to act  that is in charge of the situation?  Big difference. 
[00:51:00]  Well, I'm working on it.  I'm working on the problem here.  But I got a goddamn hangover that I'm dealing with here.  I hear engineers are on the job.  I hear.  He's going to be taken care of, Mr. Senator.  Remember your dying king.  That's a great line.  All right, Ben.  There's nothing funnier than Pete Johnson just so excited.  Like, I told you about those guys.  He's back there.  Listen, they have no idea.  Pete is like the Superman of engineers. 
[00:51:30]  I could fix the problem in a second.  What's worse?  What's worse, though?  That we're not on the air in New Orleans today?  Or that only one person called to tell us we're not on the air in New Orleans?  I know.  How pathetic are we today?  I'm right on top of it.  I'll get right to it.  Taking care of it.  Right after I take more pictures of my wife nude.  Don't you like when you're talking and you can just totally visualize what he's doing?  Because he's talking.  Here he is.  He's like, well, we're looking into the problem.  And we'll get that taken care of in a matter of hours. 
[00:52:00]  Hours.  Not day.  What's wrong with the station?  It's a riddle wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a mystery.  Who knows that?  I love those lines, man.  The situation's got to be taken care of.  We're off the air.  We're off the air.  Well, we had to tell him, by the way.  Yeah.  He didn't even know.  I didn't know.  Thank you for...  I had to go meet my dealer.  You're alerting me to the situation. 
[00:52:30]  Situation.  I'm working on it.  That's not like there's a lot of people in town today.  Whatever.  You know, maybe pick up a bunch of new listeners.  There's nothing big going on in New Orleans today, right?  Where they will be driving around in cabs and cars, maybe checking out radio stations.  Probably not.  I don't think there's much going on today.  I just, if I could mention, I can't believe this and that this wasn't front page. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Is this show prep?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bringing something to the show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, let's sit back and enjoy it.  I got a million of them.  Rosie, they say, may be coming out on her show.  Oh, like a big finale to her hosting her show?  Yes.  She should have come out in the last episode.  I am indeed a fat unt.  It's amazing how she comes out when the show is off, when she's ready to go off the air. 
[00:53:30]  Well, she's leaving.  Yeah, Miss Sincerity.  Yeah.  You know, I like to eat box.  All right, here's the next host.  So true.  Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  When the ratings were there and the fat housewives in the Midwest couldn't have handled her being gay,  she kept her mouth shut and called Tom Cruise a cutie patootie.  A cutie patootie.  Oh, Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  But now that there's nothing to lose.  You've got to make money on the books, so you might as well.  Oh, let's call and read about that.  You know what the best, though, is watching when she would get Nicole Kidman on that goddamn show 
[00:54:00]  and talk about how, I'll be taking Tom from you.  I'll be taking Tom away.  You know, me and Tommy getting awful close.  And she's probably sitting there, like, thinking in her head,  between Tom Cruise probably just wanting to hob a man's knob  and you with your face buried in either an apple pie, a pizza, or a rug.  I don't think I got one goddamn thing to worry about with you.  And, um, fatso, hey, get a load of fatso there. 
[00:54:30]  He came in, he said, I got a load of fatso.  She eats box, Harvey.  Come on out, Harvey.  I know she's a box eater, Harvey.  I never knew lesbians were so fat.  I get a load of fatso.  But I know different Harvey, but I...  Come on, Harvey.  Two different Harveys.  Harvey.  Harvey. 
[00:55:00]  Wait, speaking of fat people...  Oh, a segue to Opie.  Yeah, show prep and segues.  I see G Huey.  We're getting two, two, two bits from Norton on this two for Tuesday.  Wow.  A fat Barbie is being made.  Yeah, this is great.  They decided they needed a fat Barbie.  To represent all of the fat children.  They got a picture of it?  Yeah, she's actually not bad, but she's supposed to be 5'11", 190,  which constitutes, that's like a six... 
[00:55:30]  I hope it comes with six shots so Ken will bang her.  Let me see.  Ken comes with the beer goggles.  That's good.  It's just...  Self-esteem sold separately.  It's just to be politically correct.  You know, maybe they'll make her diabetic with nine toes,  fat, overeating, stupid 5'11", pig of a Barbie.  Here are some of the stats.  It's, oh, an M. 
[00:56:00]  Is that Emma or what's her name from that goddamn, the fat model?  Here it is.  Barbie is about a size two in human dress size.  She's about a 14 to 16.  That they're chalking up.  Turns out to be 5'11", 190.  Yeah.  Barbie, about 90 pounds.  She's about 190.  And, um, ho-ho's not included.  Retail price, 150 bucks.  It's almost a dollar a pound.  That pig's a selfish fool. 
[00:56:30]  Read the importance of that.  That's great.  That's great.  How many people a year?  Because if everybody cries about Barbie being anorexic.  Oh, anorexia.  Right, right.  Barbie unfairly takes the rap, kills about 1,000 Americans a year.  But obesity responds for about 300,000 deaths a year.  Exactly.  That's apolitical correctness.  Take the doll and eat it, you fat pigs. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, uh...  Fill it with cream and suck the cream out of her head.  Yes, Opie.  I'm sorry.  Getting back to Tom.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, Tom, that's running the station in New Orleans.  We're off the air.  And it seems like he doesn't really care because he doesn't have enough energy to deal with the problem today, Anthony.  I'm on it.  Anyway, Rick has found more clips about Tom when we were in Mardi Gras.  Oh, he did.  These are clips of us commenting about Tom.  Okay.  And his ineptness.  Mm-hmm.  This is Norton on Tom. 
[00:57:30]  He's got the dexterity of an ox.  He was kind of falling all over the place, wasn't he?  Yeah, just clumsy with a 400-pound head.  Here's another one.  Isn't this great?  You can drink at the airport.  That's an imitator.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  By the baggage carousel.  He was just,  Oh, you can drink at the airport.  I love this place.  Another clip.  We got to talk about Tom who runs the station down here in New Orleans.  I'm still not totally convinced he does.  I cannot see how a guy like that could run a station. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  He shows up hammered to the airport to pick us up.  He's offering to buy us drugs.  I don't know what's going on.  You thought we were making all this up.  Today we're not even on the air.  That's true.  And he's like, what?  What's going on?  Here's another one.  What is his title?  Mickey Rourke from Barfly.  That's what his title is.  I was commenting about Tom's wife.  When do you think his wife will sober up? 
[00:58:30]  2010?  It's kind of hard when you're on a 12-year bender.  We got plenty of them, but here's one more for now.  If it cues up.  There we go.  Tom, we're trying to do a broadcast for your radio station down here.  How about we wait?  You alcoholic.  We'll have more as we go along here.  All right.  That's great.  Does the new Barbie doll appreciate it more? 
[00:59:00]  I think the kids should buy the doll just to leave it in the corner and watch the skinny Barbie have the fun.  Or maybe she could C-block Ken from actually taking her home.  Or you put the fat one in the dream house and then to get her out, you have to cut the sides out.  And you have a flathead picker up.  Get the teamsters.  Bring her to the hospital.  Why don't they sell a Barbie with a little bit of willpower who doesn't shove cookies in her 5'11 fat mouth?  How big a pig are you when you're 5'11 and still fat? 
[00:59:30]  I can see if you're 5'2", but you...  You got to work at it.  You really do.  Ah, George, you're up.  What's up?  Hey, they used to make Ken with detachable arms.  So when he wakes up in the morning, you know, he'd take them off like he chewed them off.  Look at the chew-off.  Ken with the chew-off-able arm.  That's great.  Jesus.  There you go.  All right, George.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Look at this.  Cab driver Ricky checking in again from New Orleans.  Ricky, what's up? 
[01:00:00]  Well, they still didn't fix the problem.  We got Tom on the phone and...  It's all right.  We're working on it.  He's going to get right to it, it looks like.  No, that sucks because every day he does this, every now and then.  But this is the longest he's ever done it.  Every day, but not all day.  Yeah, right now it's all...  We'll get on it somehow.  Yeah, I'm probably missing out on some good stuff, man.  All right.  You're missing a great show today.  Probably the best one we've had in weeks.  Well, why don't you just let me listen over the phone? 
[01:00:30]  Just put me on hold, man.  I'm addicted.  Ah, hell no.  Oh, come on, man.  Hey, could you run Tom over with your cab?  Look, I will do it if I can find his ass.  Hey, Ricky, go to the station in New Orleans and confront Tom and call us back.  Yeah, man, because I'm like the...  Hey, I'm...  Did anybody else from New Orleans call?  No, that's the problem.  No one really cares that we're not on today.  I'm the only one that cares, man.  Look, I'm going to put some sense in these damn people, all right? 
[01:01:00]  Hey, I got a customer right now that's trying to put you guys on.  Yeah.  It's not on yet.  And it's not on.  I'm like, man, this is embarrassing.  All right.  You know, all right, dude.  All right, thanks, Ricky.  No problem.  There he goes.  Hi, Han, all this power?  Look, I put the check in the mail yesterday.  Now, we need power for the station.  What you need?  I'll get you anything you need.  Well...  I'll cut the check.  I'll send you some ecstasy and some cocaine. 
[01:01:30]  What you need?  Want to see my wife naked?  What we need is an on switch, Tom.  We'll turn it on.  Well, the power company seems to have forgotten I paid them last month.  I'll send my wife over there to flash them.  Maybe they'll turn on the power.  Power.  That guy's a pisser.  It's contestant number blank, the model for Fat Parpy.  They're adding in numbers. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, he got a paper cut.  Ow, I saw it happen.  Oh, God.  Those give me the heebie-jeebies.  You were toying with the faxes, with the emails.  And where did it get you?  Right on the web.  Between the thumb and the index finger.  Oh, I hate that.  You ever get one on the helmet right across the hole?  Oh, God.  Ah!  Torture!  It's torture!  Ow! 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, you picture that little...  Ah!  Right across the hole.  I can't even see all of that kind of pain.  A little lemon wedge just to straighten you out.  You ever get, like, a piece of skin on the side of your nail, and you decide to pull  it off, and it pulls all the way down to your elbow?  It starts at your finger, and you peel it back until there's a thin red stripe all the  way down to your elbow.  And then you dip it in vinegar.  Ouch! 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  That sounds bad.  I hate that.  Can I just point out one more thing that I did a little show prep with?  Oh, alrighty.  It's not a bit, it's just an observation.  Well, we still have two and a half hours.  Oh, I know.  You want to spread out your show prep?  No, no, because there's just so much more.  Yeah, there is.  I just wanted to say...  You're going to be out on the next break when we talk about the Olympics.  Ah.  Yeah, yeah, no, I saw a lot of them.  They were really interesting.  You'll probably have something witty to say when we talk about the 55-gallon drum challenge, 
[01:03:30]  though.  You'll come back strong for that.  Well, the Olympic break, he could join in with everyone else in calling me a faggot.  I don't have a joke, I just have an observation of what a stupid, pathetic country we live in.  On page nine, new terror attacks are expected today, that's what I said.  Yeah, the alert has been put out now, has been put out.  Yeah, you know, thanks for the alert, but why don't you tell us what's going to happen?  But the important thing...  Why don't you tell us, you know, maybe today's not a good idea to get on a train. 
[01:04:00]  Here's the alert.  They said that they have credible, yeah, intelligence that say that something may happen today to  Americans either here or in Yemen or maybe anywhere else on this globe.  A message to the U.S. government, this isn't the 11 o'clock news.  Enough with the news tease.  Yeah, don't tease it.  Tell us what's happening.  Should we go outside today?  They don't know. 
[01:04:30]  Should we get in our cars and drive 400 miles away from a populated area?  Tell us.  I know one thing, it's probably one of the best days to do anything,  because when the hell have we ever got advance warning that actually panned out and was able to help us out?  Is today a good day to fly?  How about a little something extra?  Don't happen.  It's page nine.  Page two is friends.  Stars okay, more season for a million an episode.  That's why we are dummies as Americans.  Now that's a good observation. 
[01:05:00]  That's an important story.  The friends being renewed for another season.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just really...  That's what I want to hear.  I enjoy your observational humor.  Thank you, yeah.  It's nice.  Who are these people?  Page nine is the warning that we all might die today,  and page two is friends.  They're going to get a million dollars per episode each.  And when did you stop living in, like, an apartment building with your friends  and having them just burst into the door and go,  Hey-ho, how are you doing, everyone?  And there's always a funny comment that doesn't offend anyone.  I mean, maybe a couple of seasons. 
[01:05:30]  It might have been the least bit...  I don't know.  No.  Entertaining...  No, nothing.  No, I don't watch the program.  Until David Schwimmer has some girl say,  I'm not banging you, you look like underdog.  I hate his stupid, flat, awful, Sandra Bullock-y looking...  He looks like a big...  Like a little puppet.  Like, not like an Otto and George-type puppet,  but like one of those little foam puppets.  He has a face like a foam puppet. 
[01:06:00]  A foam puppet?  A foamy puppet.  All right.  Yeah.  Jack, what's up?  How's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I went to my daughter's room one night.  She was crying.  I kicked the door jam and tore my big toenail off.  That's the worst.  Why didn't you just open the door, sir?  I did.  The door was open, and I just didn't navigate well  because I wasn't awake.  Everyone's done the yam bag or the schlong and the zipper.  Oh.  Where you just pull that thing up. 
[01:06:30]  You're in a hurry.  You take the lead.  You pull up.  It's like, oh, boy, we got trouble.  Yeah.  We got big trouble.  And you go, this isn't gum sticking out of my zipper.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, that was a sick scene.  Especially...  It just looks like someone's brain popping out through the fly.  Especially if you're in an excited state and you realize, uh-oh, principal's coming.  Let me help you with that young fella. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, boy.  I'm a-scared, sir.  I see Earl's silliness taking over.  Oh, my God.  It's going to be the silly show again today.  Matt, what's up?  Oh, ho!  Hey, Matt.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  You tell us.  Is that fat barbie's that come with its own flower so Ken can roll them around and find  a wet flower?  Back to the barbie's little bag of flower.  Very good, man.  Take care of you, boys.  Have a good one.  Oh, man.  Well, let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I hear Mattel's working on a 110-pound hen-pecked Ken that goes out and gets Oreos  for fat barbies.  Hen-pecked.  Hey, that's for your new format, you know?  Thank you.  What a Flintstone's where that is.  You're a hen-pecked husband.  That's right, though.  Chubby chaser Ken.  Hey, Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  This just in, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  The Turs have taken out the New Orleans radio station.  Yeah, that must be it. 
[01:08:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, we got him down here.  Dude, Jersey Bob, thanks.  Jeff, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I heard they're calling it DFF Barbie.  Designated fat friend Barbie.  Very good.  Later on, are they going to introduce the uncle that touched her when she was a kid that turned  her in the fat bitch she is?  Cover up that loneliness, Barb.  Not even Barb, just Barb.  Barbie's too cute. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, Barb is a fat girl.  Hey, Barb.  Probably comes with her knees.  She could probably sit perfectly, and it comes with a toilet and a nice six-inch log you can  drop in there.  A newspaper all in the sports section.  Hey, as we go to break here, let's play Darth Vulgar.  Oh, remember that.  Yeah, we got a few requests for this damn thing.  Oh, wait. 
[01:09:00]  Paul is checking in.  Paul, what's up?  Paul?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello.  Go ahead.  What's up?  On 1010 News this morning, they had mentioned that Lord of the Rings was off for a couple  nominations, and then they casually threw in that Rumsfeld mentioned that there's a terrorist  threat today.  Yeah, our big news station here in New York City, and they mentioned the Oscar list first,  the important stuff, and then that there's some kind of terrorist warning.  Whatever happened to Never Forget? 
[01:09:30]  Ah, we're stupid?  We forgot so quickly.  I mean, you know, the bottom line is the security now at bridges and tunnels and whatnot.  Remember right after it happened, there was just, you could not cross a bridge without  cops looking in your goddamn car as you're driving through.  And now they just opened up a lane by the GWB.  Hey, what happened that made us so secure now?  Security in this building today at lunchtime?  Yeah.  The only day that I was hoping to see a security guy because of this warning? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Nowhere to be seen.  Every other day, he'll be down there.  These security guys, I was like, what the hell are they going to do?  Excuse me, Mr. Terrorist, could you sign out?  Yes, I will sign out.  Where did I leave bomb?  Why do I speak Russian?  San Francisco Airport.  Was this talked about yesterday, the other day, they lost the guy?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Wait.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, go.  No, what?  What do you got?  Doug's going to just put the whole Barbie bit over the top.  Let's go to Doug.  Doug from Springfield. 
[01:10:30]  Go ahead, Doug.  Ken's going to need the Kung Fu grip so Barbie doesn't steal a sandwich from him.  A puss-a!  Nice.  Doug on fire today.  We'll be back with our Winter Olympics discussion.  Oh, yes.  Hey, this is Steve-O, and you're listening to the Opie and Andy Show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I f***?  All right.  Opie and Anthony Show and illegal street narcotics are keeping me alive.  M-E-W. 
[01:11:00]  And we're back with the O&A Show.  The Strokes last night, by the way.  Great song.  Good God.  Nora Hayden is here today, huh?  Yes, you may remember her from her last appearance on this very program.  She was a lot of fun last time, so we invited her back.  We were going to have a huge special guest today.  I'm not going to tease it.  It's not happening. 
[01:11:30]  I don't even think we should tell everyone who it was because there's a lot of C-blockers out there.  We're trying for a future date.  This was the second try at this person.  Wrong.  And it was looking really, really good.  But something big happened, and that's all we should say right now.  Unfortunately, there's C-blockers out there, so if we give the name, then it'll never happen. 
[01:12:00]  So trust us on this one, all right?  So instead, you got Nora Hayden.  Why not?  She's a hot fox.  Why'd you have her in?  Just because she looks like Hitler's secretary?  Hey, look at that.  Hitler's secretary.  She's entertaining, though.  She was in a lot of B-flicks, and she knows how to, like, satisfy a man and stuff.  Oh, she said her method was the best. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I remember that.  Remember?  But that was for the ladies.  Like, she was talking to the guys out there saying there's techniques she has.  What's wrong?  I just know none of the headphones are working today for some reason.  Oh, yeah, here it is.  We talked to, she has a couple, number one, we're not letting her in yet.  Oh, all right.  Number one, the New York Times bestselling books.  Last time she was in, we talked about how to satisfy a woman every time.  Yeah.  And have her beg for more.  Sure.  That went so well.  Today, we're going to be talking about her other book. 
[01:13:00]  What is this one?  How to satisfy a man every time.  Oh, boy, let me see now.  And have him beg for more.  Now there's no pulling punches.  I kind of like this book, considering we have nothing but guys that listen to us.  You know what?  With the last book.  I don't even think we talked about the last book.  Yeah, well, briefly, when we did, I would say, like, I don't believe that.  And her being a woman, she'd go, no, that's the way it is.  But now with this one, it's like how to satisfy a man.  I'm going to read some of this and go, no, that's crap.  Okay.  It's easy to satisfy a man, right? 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Yep.  All right.  Ah, yes.  First.  Olympic coverage.  Oh, I think Bruce Willis is calling us today, though.  Is he?  Yeah, that'll be fun.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Have you seen any of the Olympics, Opie?  And Bob Costas covering the Olympics with his fake fireplace behind him?  That ain't it.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Well, I tuned it in last night to watch a little curling.  Were you watching the curling?  So I quickly turned that off.  Yeah, that's something they can't televise.  Then I went back and they were doing more snowboarding.  Yeah.  Lots and lots of snowboarding going on.  Wow.  Hey, I enjoy the snowboarding.  Big time, but I don't know.  I want to see some other sports.  Well, you know, we as Americans are so, so proud of when our country does well in the 
[01:14:30]  Olympics, but I got to tell you something, and I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack  from you goddamn snowboarders out there, but you should know more than anyone else.  That ain't an Olympic sport.  Nope.  Why not?  Snowboarding is not an Olympic sport, and America shouldn't be this proud and, hey,  hey, look at us, that we swept three medals.  It takes skill to pull off those fakies and stuff.  You are absolutely right.  And the goofy, the goofy thing, the goofy foot. 
[01:15:00]  Standing goofy foot?  Standing goofy foot?  You try standing goofy foot.  First of all, the only goofy thing are the announcers trying to sound hip while they're  announcing these goddamn events.  The snowboarding.  They're talking to these stoner kids.  You weren't impressed by how much air these kids got?  Yes.  I'm not saying it's not impressive.  See, if you're getting confused with what I'm saying, the listeners are going to tear  me a new A.  The thing is, I've been to the snow parks.  I've seen these guys snowboard.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:15:30]  I could never, ever, ever, ever do this.  Of course not.  You have a job, and you're an adult.  Oh, my God.  Never.  Very, very talented at their snowboarding craft.  But it is not an Olympic event.  And the thought that people are, oh, my God, they got three gold medals.  America won the silver, the bronze, the silver, and the gold.  It's the first time.  And then they go, this is the first time this has happened since 1955 with the ski competition. 
[01:16:00]  Don't even hold it next to the last time this happened.  Because, of course, they're going to win all the medals.  Who the hell else is up against us?  I'm sure it's not a country where privileged, stoned children get to go to the ski resorts  and tear up the mountains.  Thank you.  And then go to the Olympics.  They're not Olympic athletes.  If I can read...  I think the Russians did quite fine with the snowboarding. 
[01:16:30]  It's only because blacks have taken over other sports that little white kids need to excel at  something, so they go to snowy areas and invent new sports.  That's all it is, because they stink at basketball, baseball, and football.  We invented the goddamn sport.  I had quite an outside shot there, Norton.  This is not amazing.  This is not an Olympic sport.  It's not a sport.  You don't put in the Olympics a sport that you can see a kid doing after smoking a ton of pot  at any ski resort around this country. 
[01:17:00]  I have seen snowboarders, and I have been amazed.  You stand on the side of the pipe, and you watch them go down there, and you're like,  holy Jesus, that's amazing.  This kid's got no fear.  He doesn't care if he comes down and breaks his neck.  And I say, hopefully, he'll come down and break his neck, because that's really what I want to say.  But as far as being an Olympic sport where three medals were handed out, a bronze, a silver, and a gold,  where real Olympic athletes would kill for a chance to get Olympic medals. 
[01:17:30]  And it's just, here's what the paper is saying about this one kid from Jersey.  Right around the corner here.  He probably listens to our show, Ian.  America's newest silver medalist is a Jersey kid who rides on a snowboard that's painted to look like a casket,  trains on Taco Bell, and with his shaggy hair and sunken chest,  looks more like a mall rat than a world-class athlete.  Smoke weed every day.  They're not Olympic athletes. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, but that kid, I know who you're talking about.  Last year, he took the gold and missed Pac-Man at the summer.  Who cares about this sport?  Jim, at least come up with a current goddamn computer game.  For the love of God.  You know, you goof on us about the computer games, but at least we could pull a current one.  You know, say Metal of Honor or something.  Max Payne would have been nice.  Even Max Payne, Grand Theft Auto 3.  You went back 20 goddamn years for a video game.  And you'll notice that directly coincides with when I went through puberty and discovered girls. 
[01:18:30]  I stopped the video games.  You don't enjoy a game of Gallagher still?  No.  A little Gallagher.  Gallagher.  Here's his brother, Matt, talking.  He says, I don't think Danny's ever been to a gym in his life.  I don't think he's ever even had a membership.  And, you know what?  What?  I got to be on the other side of this.  Why?  Are you going to...  All right, so you're telling me that snowboarding is not a real sport, right?  I don't consider it an Olympic game.  It could... 
[01:19:00]  In the X Games?  You want to put him in the X Games and go wild?  Extreme, man!  Let me tell you, the charity that appeared at the X Games!  You know, it's not in the Olympic tradition.  Well, but that's why the Olympics are doing it, because they want younger viewers.  You're saying snowboarding is not a sport, but luge is?  You know something?  Tell me the skill luge.  Luge, where you run real fast, lay on your sled, and wait till you get to the bottom.  I will tell you something.  Luge, very silly.  Very silly.  And the two-man luge, gayer than an episode of Oz. 
[01:19:30]  The two-man luge.  Who got on the one-man luge and then decided, after he pulled up the mountain, go,  Hey, Sven, come down with me.  Sit in my lap.  This will be fun.  Well, the Finns are pretty good at two-man luge.  I reckon one thing...  I'll tell you about the luge, though.  You wouldn't find two stoners on a luge at the same time?  Where can you go and go, Oh, hey, could I rent a luge here at the ski resort?  You don't see luge.  It's an old, time-tested Olympic event, and you don't see people tearing up the luges at your ski resort. 
[01:20:00]  When it comes down to how sharp your blades are on your luge, whether you're going to win a medal or not...  He's not keeping those toes pointed, and that head's got to be down.  He's having a good run.  You know, I was watching it last night, and there is some opportunity for some real disaster in the luge, which is also good,  and I think that makes for a good Olympic event.  You know?  I want to see some kid who, Oh, he's spraying my ankle, dude, darling.  Hey, dude, he smokes more weed. 
[01:20:30]  All right, continue with the silver medalist.  Yeah, so they're talking about him being an Olympic athlete, and then, let's see, they were talking, and the press starts talking to him,  and he told the press that he had received a call from the president, and someone said, Really?  He goes, I'm serious.  And then they asked the president of the United States, he goes, No, the president of Grenade Gloves, man.  It's a company he and Matt started last year. 
[01:21:00]  He was excited that the president of Grenade Gloves had called him.  And then a few days before the competition, he was asked if he could see himself on a Wheaties box.  Very huge goal of the Olympiad, the Olympic athletes, to be on a Wheaties box.  Quite prestigious.  Yeah, Bruce Jenner in that tradition.  Right.  Yeah.  And he goes, No, Wheaties, man.  I wouldn't eat Wheaties.  Count Chocula, maybe.  So he said, Stop effing pandering to white kids in the suburbs. 
[01:21:30]  Can you stop it?  Wheaties do stink, though.  Wheaties are awful, and Count Chocula is a tasty little treat in the morning.  Here we go.  Let's see.  There were numerous signs, including the one that said Danny Cass, born in the USA.  One friend carried a naked blow-up doll.  It's the mascot for Grenade Gloves.  We got it in a sex store in Greenwich Village, said the guy who was carrying it.  I think this rocks.  Sometimes Cass's exuberance gets him in trouble. 
[01:22:00]  One of the most oft-told stories on the riding circuit is about the huge industry trade show in Vegas last year  when Danny used Matt's ID to do some unauthorized drinking and nearly got arrested for public urination.  Now, I'm not saying this is great.  This is pretty much describing every road show that we throw together.  You know what I mean?  Don't get me wrong.  Don't get me wrong.  The kid's great.  Tear it up.  Have fun.  It's not in the Olympic tradition. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, but there are a lot of stupid sports in the Winter Olympics.  What else?  How about that one where it's cross-country skiing and then they stop to shoot a while?  That's just stupid.  Yeah, the bicathlon or the biathlon.  Biathlon.  Winter biathlon.  It's steeped in tradition, Opie, the skiing shooting thing.  And it made for great James Bond movies.  No, it's skiing down there, shooting those commies.  No, it's the coolest Winter Olympic sport.  The one where it's just straight downhill. 
[01:23:00]  Not downhill where they're going in and out, where they just point the ski straight down the mountain and go.  I like that one.  Have you seen that?  They go over 100 miles an hour on skis?  Not as good as the jump, the ski jump, the 90-meter jump.  I sat and watched an entire episode where I think there was a wind problem and every skier wiped out.  It was like they were sacrificing the skier.  They'd send another one down.  He'd take off.  He's got good form.  He's over the tip of his skis. 
[01:23:30]  That's what he needs.  Uh-oh, he's in trouble.  And then it turns into from looking like he's flying to he just fell off a mountain.  And he's just doing the rag doll down the mountain.  That I could watch.  You know, my favorite part of the Winter Olympics is the favorite event is the closing ceremonies.  I'm so sick of these stupid foreigners coming.  I don't want that kind of fun interaction with foreigners.  They come into America.  You know what type of interaction we had?  Get the National Guard to get these bearded monkeys out of our country. 
[01:24:00]  That's the type of little fun we should be having with foreigners.  Thank God they put them all on the front page, though.  The terrorists.  They have a whole list of more terrorists on the front page of the New York Post here today.  And I could not tell you the difference between one of those guys.  There isn't.  It's the same guy.  They've taken just numerous pictures and changed the tint.  Just one big, disgusting, uncircumcised go-bot.  Well, you know something, Mr. Norton, we do have to get along with our lives and celebrate in the international tradition that is the Olympics. 
[01:24:30]  Come on, you know, wave that flag.  Go, America.  Go, go, USA snowboard team.  Now, you know what event is really great?  Who can drop the heaviest daisy cutter?  That's a fine Olympic event.  I like that one.  Greg, what's up?  You know, it gets me mad.  It took baseball 20 years to become an official Olympic sport.  These potheads get it in six months.  Yeah.  What's up with that? 
[01:25:00]  Well, because of the success of the X Games, the Olympics had to do something.  That means that skateboarding is right around the corner.  Oh, you will see that in the Summer Olympics.  They'll get skateboarding.  They'll do, you know, a bong-making competition.  Dude, he's going to get great scoring on this bong.  Look, it's a six-footer.  He's using a PVC tube.  Graphite.  Do you know, I don't think chess is an Olympic sport.  It's not played in the Olympics.  Chess.  Chess.  Not played in the Olympics.  Who would watch it?  I would.  Stop it.  You would watch chess on TV? 
[01:25:30]  Absolutely.  You fake intelligence.  No, no.  I'm not saying I could follow it, but I would watch it.  And was checking out the figure skating.  No, he wasn't.  I was watching the pair figure skating, the couples.  Look how he tries to make it sound cool.  Go ahead, Ed.  Try.  Because I was watching.  No, say that again.  I was watching the Olympics.  Be all proud of yourself.  Say it again.  I watched the paired skating.  Figure skating.  Were they naked at least? 
[01:26:00]  No, they weren't.  Was it chick-topless, hopefully?  No, no.  They were wearing their little skating outfits.  Maybe she wasn't wearing panties.  So you get a glimpse of everyone's in the world?  No, they wear panties, the girls, and that's kind of cool that their skirt blows up when  they skate backwards.  Yeah.  You know, blows up over their back.  What did you do while you were watching it?  Sip a Zima in your apartment in Chelsea?  That's awful.  No, it's the Olympics.  A Zima joke.  And if you knew anything, Norton, you would realize that there was a huge controversy  in the finish. 
[01:26:30]  They're in the gold.  The Russian team, which had been dominant in the paired skating since the 1960 Olympics,  Norton.  I'm doing a show at Red Buttons.  They had a chance, the Canadian team, of unseating the Russians for the first time in that many  years.  I was wondering why you were wearing a bow tie today.  Well, I like to get into the whole Olympic thing.  I'm wearing my sportscaster's jacket.  So the Canadians could have unseated the Russians.  The Canadians could have done it. 
[01:27:00]  The Russian team skated, and there were a couple of screw-ups.  Nothing big, no big falls or anything, but the guy on the Russian team had a few landings  that were not good.  He almost fell.  Did they pull off the sow cow?  I don't know the moves.  I'm not...  I watch.  I kind of know when they're screwing up.  You can tell.  It's a very rhythmic thing.  They're very in sync with each other.  And if they go off, you can tell by watching at home. 
[01:27:30]  And there were a couple of inconsistencies with their program.  With their program.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  So then the Canadian team gets up.  Yeah.  A flawless program.  If I may use the word, Opie, they looked fabulous.  You should never use the word fabulous.  Ever.  Got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  I'll be serious.  They did not make one mistake. 
[01:28:00]  The throw...  When you see this big...  What did you say?  Faggot.  Flawless.  Throw the woman that is his skating partner.  Because, hey, there's no delusions there.  The guys...  Here's Anthony after he...  Oh.  The skater pulled off the move.  Oh.  How's that for a chopper?  Oh.  Oh.  You know, you get the guy.  He throws the girl pretty much.  He will pick her up and throw her.  She'll spin like three times and... 
[01:28:30]  Land on the ice.  Flawless the entire program.  Here's Anne.  You get the smell of that Canadian box out of his face.  Throwing it away.  Here's Anne commenting on the Canadians after their performance.  Yeah.  That's a winner.  That's what I thought.  But...  There was some really crappy judging going on.  Mm-hmm.  And for some reason, the chinky judge, the chinky Chinese judge, and the Russian judge had a little bit of a problem. 
[01:29:00]  And the Russians went on to win and kept their reign over the paired skating, Jim Norton.  Good.  Good.  Why?  Because I just don't care about the Canadians or the Russians.  And if someone's dreams were crushed unfairly, that's what you get.  I think if you're in the Olympics and you're up against something like a clock, like you're in the ski competition, downhill skiing, and it's a timed event.  The clock, yes.  And it's a timed event. 
[01:29:30]  How can you get a panel of people to interpret your work and tell you if you're better than other people that are doing the same job?  Oh, this, now this is, okay.  Now I'm drawing the line.  The sound effects are one thing.  There's no reason to play ABBA over my Olympic commentary.  Jesus Christ, man.  Okay, so I was spanking it, and my girl walked in, so I put on NASCAR. 
[01:30:00]  All right?  That's cooler, though, in a way.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  The, uh, look, look at this.  I'm getting thank yous to, oh, from girls.  You know what type of, uh, uh, uh, uh, like an ice skating thing would be really cool?  If you took a water buffalo and put skates on him, and then watch him drag Christopher Reeves in his wheelchair around an icy rink and smash him into the walls, and we all laughed and clapped.  That would be worth watching.  I would watch that, too, Norton.  Not even in his wheelchair. 
[01:30:30]  Just by his dead, numb legs.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Uh, and, uh, there's someone that supports you on Line 11 here.  All right.  Chris, uh, also saw the figure skating.  You did?  Yes, Chris.  See, other people watch it.  Yes.  It's the Olympics.  Go ahead, Chris.  What's up, man?  I, uh, watched a pair of figure skating, too.  And, uh, right after I had some backdoor sex with my boyfriend.  You're an ass.  Shut up.  What?  He was supporting you, Ann.  Yeah.  A little support.  Can't hurt.  Kevin, what's up? 
[01:31:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  How you doing?  I've lost all respect for the Winter Olympics.  Um, remember back in Albertville, they had that demonstration sport, uh, speed skiing?  That's what I was talking about.  Yeah, the speed downhill.  They just, uh, go straight down the hill.  That was the looks of those suits they wore, Opie, with that helmet on.  That was, uh, that was a trip, man.  Yeah.  And, I mean, to see a guy go 120 miles down a hill and then actually live to tell about  it, that's, I'd rather watch that than snowboarders any day of the week.  A lot of people are saying they got rid of that, uh, sport, though.  So, yeah, they did.  They got rid of the sport off together.  It was too dangerous. 
[01:31:30]  It was insane.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Kevin.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Bye.  Chris from Philly.  Chris from Philly saying the last Olympics, uh, saw the introduction of trampoline jumping,  a female sport.  Points are awarded for staying toward the center of the trampoline.  They need to kill a whole bunch of these stupid sports.  I agree, uh, Chris.  Uh, Bluntsworth.  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey.  I got to say, I don't see what the big deal with the medal is.  In my opinion, everybody in paired skating ends up a loser. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you.  You guys should have some stoner Olympics.  I could build a damn good phone.  Stoner Olympics.  Mm.  Stoner Olympics.  Mm.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  You know what it is, though?  I don't think, like, Stinky should be able to be an Olympic athlete.  But, you know, if you smoked enough pot and tore it up on the snowboard, uh, on the half  pipe or something, he could do it.  I think they should take a little more work.  Beautiful.  Uh, 12-year-old Gary, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Gary.  I think the Olympic Games are for facts. 
[01:32:30]  Good boy, Gary.  Oh, boy.  It's a faggot game.  Stoner freaking guys wiping out and then getting up and saying, I'm okay.  I'm okay.  Can I have some of my pound in the pot?  For my winning, I'll trade you with my gold medal.  Hey, Gary.  Know what straight sex is before you start talking about faggots, okay?  Look who's talking.  You want to drive skating?  Yeah, you're right, young man.  You're right, Gary.  All right, Gary.  Thank you.  Not a point.  You're absolutely right.  Old tool drinker yelling at Gary. 
[01:33:00]  I was watching the Olympics.  What is the...  Cab driver Ricky checking in again.  Ricky.  Yo, what's happening?  We up and running again.  Ah, thank God.  We're back out there in New Orleans.  Yeah, it took two hours, but...  Well, man.  I still got my customer in the car, man.  She's ripped right now, dude.  From Mardi Gras?  Yeah, she's been drinking Heineken's all...  Ever since she got my cab.  Nice.  Hello, girl.  All right.  Well, we got to let you go, because we got to get Tom on the air to find out what the 
[01:33:30]  problem was.  Hey.  Man, get in that ass.  All right.  Thank you, Ricky.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I don't know why it's such a big issue.  What?  I just...  I saw it, and I thought that the Canadian team was rooked of a gold, and I'm watching  the Olympics, and I'm commenting on it, and for some reason, I'm a goddamn faggot.  I kind of...  I enjoyed your commentary.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  Maybe if a little more culture was around this hovel, maybe Jim Norton would be able 
[01:34:00]  to add something to this conversation, a little more intelligent.  I mentioned chess, and I was ridiculed.  I mentioned a fat man.  Because there is no chess in the Olympics.  Exactly.  That's why the Olympics have no integrity.  Because there's not a chess company.  Well, we'll sit here, and our continuing coverage of the Olympic chess match, as we  watch, and just look at the look of concentration and determination.  We're in our 18th hour of coverage on this one move that we're waiting for. 
[01:34:30]  We believe he's going to move the pawn out.  It is the first move.  It hasn't been made yet with our continuing 18 hours of coverage.  Of course, we'll be right here when a move is made.  Olympic chess.  First brought to us the idea in early 2002 by Jim Norton, a comic and pervert from the  Opie Anthony show. 
[01:35:00]  And boy, it's working so well.  But at least it's not a fag sport.  Exactly.  Like paired skating.  You sound like that painter over there.  Yeah, paid happy little treats.  Bobby Bigger.  Hey, Jim.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Jim.  Yes, sir.  Knight one to rook four.  How's that for you?  Ah, very nice.  That's a terrible move, though, by the way.  Yeah.  Hey, do Anthony a favor.  You can't go knight one to rook four.  All right.  What do I know?  I don't play faggy games like chess.  Hey, somebody do Anthony a favor.  Hand him a beer in that barrel, will you?  All right.  Thank you, Bobby. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, listen.  Where the hell is the agony of defeat factor in figure skating?  I'll tell you what.  They were talking about that female child.  Oh, God.  They were talking about...  Ben hit the wrong link.  Somebody sent a link on instant feedback.  They do this from time to time.  I would recommend not hitting any links now.  And Ben hit it.  What did it say, Ben?  Hot.  Hot naked chicks.  Hot naked chicks from Mardi Gras. 
[01:36:00]  He clicks on it.  It's that one everyone's seen of the man holding his balloon knot open to the size of...  A grapefruit.  Yeah, a grapefruit, and it's all red.  You dick.  That guy you're saying, where's the agony of defeat?  That Russian skater had her head laid open like her brains almost came out from a skate.  So, very dangerous sport.  Like chess, you know?  And by the way, it's knight one to bishop three.  Oh, my God.  He hit the knight.  It tipped over.  It's bursting into flames now. 
[01:36:30]  The emergency crew's coming in.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen such a tragedy in chess.  Dave?  Yes.  Dave, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  I just want to say, I know the next winner in an Olympic sport is...  What?  ...snowball fighting.  Snowball fighting judged on accuracy.  I would rather watch that than snowboarding any day.  All right, Dave.  All right, thanks.  The snowboarding was impressive for two seconds when you watch the height the guys get.  You know?  But then they're judging on amplitude and spins and... 
[01:37:00]  I'm like, yeah, I...  Well, how do they pull off the moves?  Ah, whatever.  I was entertained watching that.  The curling and all that crap.  No, I don't care.  Tim from D.C., what's up?  Hey, man.  This is Tim out here.  O.P. Anthony.  Yeah.  Hey, I've been skateboarding for 14 years and snowboarding for three, and I've never touched  drugs.  And I know a lot of guys that do this and don't do drugs.  And that stuff's hard, man.  I mean, it's just as hard as skiing or anything like that.  So, until one of you AWOTs get up there and do it yourself, come on, man.  Give us a break.  Tim, Tim, it's called stereotyping.  Something we enjoy doing. 
[01:37:30]  Not...  For example, not a big white guy, Rob.  That ain't the point.  I'm just saying, snowboarding is a valid sport.  I understand it's very hard.  It's not an Olympic sport.  No.  No, no, no.  You know what else is hard to do?  Get a really hot chick to bang me.  Why isn't that an Olympic sport?  I don't know.  I got a really hot wife and two wonderful kids.  But, hey, I still skateboard.  It's a wonderful thing, man.  It frees your brain.  You don't have to do drugs to skate.  All right.  Get a hold of yourself, would you?  Relax.  Anyway, man, I like you guys down here in D.C., and I'm spreading your word.  So, try to be all right with the skateboarders.  All right, man?  Thank you, Tim. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  All right.  Chill.  Look at his attitude, man.  I skateboard, man.  I'm a wife and two kids, so I don't get to skateboard as much as I used to.  But I still hang out with my skateboard buddies when my wife lets me, and I don't have to  drive the kids' places.  Could someone come to D.C. and shoot me in the head?  Jeez, he was bitter.  The next sport he'll be doing will be car running in the garage.  That's hard.  God damn it.  Dude, remember I called?  We got a divorce. 
[01:38:30]  She took my board, man.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Nora Hayden is here.  What's the book name, man?  How to satisfy a man every time and have him beg for more.  Yum, yum.  Give me some.  Let me read this one.  Watching some more paired figure skating.  Yum.  She's a lot of fun, though.  Also, I think Bruce Willis is going to call us today.  Hey, how about that?  And we still have the clip of the hissing cockroaches as we try to talk about the 55-gallon  drum challenge sometime today.  But right now, let's see what's going on on the FU line. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie to Anthony, FU line.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big FU to my boss, Doug, who took my cone of joy right when I  was at work and smashed into a f***ing Mack truck because he got drunk.  FU, Doug, and you owe me money.  Next message.  Yo, this is Todd from Boston.  I want to give a big f***ing FU to Trevor from Earth.  You're a f***ing faggot.  You ruined the f***ing band.  Your vocals, you sound like a f***ing wild little pussy.  You're a f***ing prick.  F*** you.  Next message.  This is a big f*** you to the steak and hoagie factory in PA. 
[01:39:30]  I went to buy some wings for Super Bowl Sunday.  250 wings, and you charged me $56.  And then, today, you call me at home and tell me that you undercharged me and that,  could I please come in to pay more money?  Because you undercharged me.  It's your f***ing fault.  Go f*** yourselves.  If I do come in there, I'm going to take some blue cheese, grease up your a**, and stick celery up it.  Go f*** yourselves. 
[01:40:00]  End of message.  Opie.  He's a son of a bitch.  Anthony.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  And E-W.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I love snowboarding.  Oh, snowboarders, relax.  Max.  I love snowboarding.  Everyone's so personal.  They get offended, and I play video games.  If they've made it a goddamn Olympic event, I think it was ridiculous, too. 
[01:40:30]  Believe me.  By the way, speaking of video games, really fast.  Tomorrow, you and I, my friend, have a meeting with Rockstar.  It better be more productive than that last goddamn meeting.  And we're going to get a sneak peek at...  Week at State of Emergency, which comes out very soon.  And if they don't come with games for us, we're throwing them out.  They might as well just go home.  We'll just tell them to leave. 
[01:41:00]  If the people from Rockstar are listening, the last meeting we had with you guys was a huge disappointment.  Yeah.  We were so excited.  We thought you guys were going to bring us some really cool stuff.  Oh, we're talking like, oh, maybe they'll have, like, an advanced copy of it for us.  Or some kind of Grand Theft Auto 3 copy that, like, has even a little more violence or some weird thing in it that they had to take out for the public.  Yeah, like, you know, maybe all the characters just naked.  Yeah.  Something.  He brought some kind of cool Easter egg or whatever.  One guy shows up with goddamn copies of Max Payne. 
[01:41:30]  Great game and all.  Rick's having a blast with it.  This was our meeting.  We watched the guy play Max Payne.  Yeah.  Ooh, ooh.  Like idiots.  Played the game already.  We played the game.  We know the game.  Okay.  Yeah, it's now available for PlayStation.  Please.  Show us something we don't know.  A little something.  Give us a little something.  Come on.  You guys are very big names in radio, and people had better realize that and bring you your games.  Bring us our games.  Bring you gifts.  If you want mentions from these two, you bring gifts. 
[01:42:00]  I don't play them.  I'm not speaking for me.  I don't want one, and I'd throw it out.  These two love them, so bring them gifts.  Wait, it's not even about getting, like, free gifts.  It's about showing us something that we haven't seen before.  That we could talk about.  That's all I give a crap about.  If you've got a version of Grand Theft Auto 3 that, you know, that you guys fool around with at the office, we want to see it.  Better than any commercial we could put on.  No, it's about respect.  That's for sure.  He's showing us how to.  It's about respect.  He's showing us how to shoot the gun, and Max Payne, we're like, dude.  I don't care.  I know how. 
[01:42:30]  Max Payne played it.  Don't worry.  All you guys do.  It's a good game.  We know that.  You talk about Grand Theft Auto because you play it and you love it.  We love it.  Bring them, not the gifts that they're bribery.  Bring them things that are free.  No, it's not about free.  It really isn't.  I don't care from my point of view.  I know you're making a joke, but it's not.  I know.  You know.  All right, bring them things.  It's not about free, but you're not charging them anything, and bring them.  You know who is angry with me?  I think Keith's a significant other.  I kind of got you involved, didn't I? 
[01:43:00]  What happened?  I kind of got him.  What happened?  What game are you playing now, Keith?  EverQuest.  How long ago did you start playing?  About a month.  How many continuous days, if you put all hours together, are you up to?  Look at his eyes.  You can tell without him even answering.  You haven't slept in weeks.  I have over three days in the game.  Three complete days.  Like, if he sat there for three complete days.  Wait, you can keep track of how long you've been playing the game?  You know how long I'm up to?  Dude, get this.  If you put every little minute I was on the game together, what are you guessing? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, for you?  Oh, do you know?  I would guess hour a day instead of preparing for the show every day times five.  Yeah, right.  Eight days of your life.  Eight.  I was going to say seven.  Seven, okay.  Way over.  What are you saying?  I would go, you're playing a lot at home, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I would say close to a month.  You're very good. 
[01:44:00]  I have about 29 days.  Yeah, it's a month.  If you put all the time together, I would have sat there day and night for a month of  my life has been spent in front of that monitor playing this goddamn game.  You can't stop.  No, see?  And now Keith's involved, and he's getting yelled at, and I'm...  Well, it's nicknamed Evercrack, right?  Evercrack and the Widowmaker.  And we were talking about it on the break.  And the Widowmaker.  That's a sign of a good game. 
[01:44:30]  You do the sickest...  I sat for an hour and made arrows the other day.  And you look at the clock, and it's like an hour went by.  What the hell have I done?  What do you mean made arrows?  I haven't played Evercrack.  You could...  If you don't want to.  You build up your skill level, and you can make your own weapons, if that's what skill...  And you just sat there and made arrows over and over again?  Point, click, this, combine, put, and you're just doing things.  You build things.  You make things.  You fight.  You pillage.  And you acquire better supplies and weapons and money to buy other supplies, weapons, and 
[01:45:00]  money.  And as he looks at me...  I just actually want to, because I know what it's like to be...  What level are you up to?  Only 15.  He's level 15.  It's not the $29 you spent on the game.  It's the other $500 in upgrades I did to my computer so I could play the game fast.  Oh, this company is just...  They have really done it up.  They put an add-on to this game.  You buy the add-on, and then you realize you need another goddamn 512 mix of RAM and 
[01:45:30]  video cards to even make the goddamn thing work.  You can't use Windows 98.  And when I went to do the job with Burrell in the morning show for the Super Bowl, John  Rossi's calling me and talking to me on the phone, giving me details, and I'm like  paying zero attention.  He goes, dude, what are you doing?  I go, I'm playing EverQuest.  And he goes, what is the matter with you?  He goes, what is the matter with Anthony?  He goes, you all are after me.  He goes, we can't accomplish anything.  It's a...  I don't know.  It's a great little game.  You just sit there, and the hours can roll by. 
[01:46:00]  An hour.  It's amazing.  Now, what serve are you on, and what character are you?  So, if anybody's out there that wants to maybe help you out a little...  The Ayune Roe.  It's the first serve.  A-Y-O-N-E.  Hey, yeah.  And what's the name?  Character name?  Salvin.  Salvin.  There you go.  Help out, Keith.  Salvin?  That's your little alter ego, is it?  Salvin.  Salvin with an A.  That's why his girlfriend's mad at him.  He makes her call him Salvin now.  It's Salvin to you. 
[01:46:30]  It's a lot of fun.  Hey, Tommy's got a little insight on state of emergency, which is just going to piss us off.  We're not taking the meeting tomorrow.  Cancel the Rockstar meeting.  Right.  Cancel it.  Tommy, what's up?  Hey.  Yo, I hate to rain on your parade, man, but I just got something from Best Buy.  I put the finals down to pre-order it.  I'm getting state of emergency tomorrow morning, like at 10.  You're getting state of emergency tomorrow at 10, which means you'll get the game before  we do, because our meeting's at around 2 tomorrow.  Why are they meeting with us?  I'm not going to sit there and watch a guy play state of emergency. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  I can figure out the game myself.  No, you guys let it go.  We're getting good.  That's why Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out.  You can get a station, you know?  Well, they're taking advantage of us.  Yep.  They haven't given us anything.  Nothing.  They've given these guys nothing.  And all we're doing is just talking about a game we truly enjoy.  We're not being forced to do it or anything.  Cancel the meeting tomorrow.  I'm totally serious.  We're not meeting with Rockstar.  Hey, Norton.  Yes, sir?  It's a waste of time.  Listen, my little brother is eight years old, right?  He's eight?  Yeah, he's eight.  He's got leukemia after he's gone. 
[01:47:30]  Thank you, Tommy.  I love you guys.  Have a good one, man.  All right.  Ted from D.C.  Hey, Ted from D.C. says he's at level 60, 171 days played.  Of your life.  Of your life.  That's not like I played four hours on one day, I played this and I did.  That is if you put all the hours together, he has spent 171 days staring at that monitor.  Oh, you know what's a really cool game?  Pick up a chick and see if she'll drink out of your mule.  That's a great game.  Yeah, you've been playing it your whole life.  I know, and the answer's always so. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And for some reason, you can't get past level one.  Game over.  Level one.  Hey, it's first base to you, mister.  How many years played?  I'm still at level zero.  Level one.  Ooh, impressive.  You're in beginner mode.  We better get Nora Hayden in here.  She's restless.  Yeah, she gets a little edgy.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  I wonder if she's playing EverQuest.  Here comes Nora Hayden.  EverQuest.  I know.  Some C.  Hey, hot box.  There she is.  Hey.  How you doing?  Fine.  How are you doing?  Great.  Great.  Great.  There you go.  I'm pumping.  I'm going to...  What's up, toots?  Hello, Jim.  Hello, Colby.  Hello, Anthony.  Hello, there.  Talking to the thing that looks like a you-know-what there.  Oh.  There you go. 
[01:49:00]  It's Dr. Iris Ryan, once again on our show.  Also known as Irish.  Irish Ryan.  You might remember her from The Angry Red Planet.  Yes.  Oh.  Movie from 1959.  She was the blonde bombshell in that movie.  Do you want to hear an Irish joke?  And she's still blonde.  Okay.  Now, it's old.  So, I hope you haven't heard it before.  Oh, golly.  An old Irish joke.  What is a seven-course Irish dinner?  All right.  I know that one.  Oh.  Oh, no, it knows it.  I won't spoil it for those of us. 
[01:49:30]  Okay.  Okay.  You give up?  Yeah.  You give up?  A potato and a six-pack.  A potato and a six-pack.  You dirty rat.  Oh, Opie, you're wrecked.  Is that an Irish joke?  I was guessing, though.  I swear.  I didn't know.  Oh, God.  All right.  You're so smart.  Here's one.  I really didn't know.  This is kind of good-natured.  How many Jewish folks can you fit in a Volkswagen?  I don't know.  Two in the front, two in the back, and six million in the ashtray.  Ho, ho.  I don't even get it.  Jeez.  Bring the room down there, Jimmy. 
[01:50:00]  Terrible.  That's a horrid joke.  Oh, my God.  I just got it.  Jim.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, Jim.  I apologize for that last joke.  Did you guys see my book?  Hey, what's the difference between St. Paddy's Day and Martin Luther King Day?  I don't know.  On St. Paddy's Day, everyone wants to be Irish.  It's an Irish joke, right?  I like it.  You like it?  How are you doing, Mara?  You brought a whole bunch of books?  Yeah, to give away.  To give away. 
[01:50:30]  Oh!  All right, why don't we pass out the book so I could...  How to satisfy a man every time and have him beg for more.  I know.  Show up naked with a six-pack and look at...  No, chapter one.  Swallow and then throw self down steps.  And keep him faithful forever.  That's right.  Isn't that what every man wants?  To be faithful to the woman he loves?  Of course, Nora.  He doesn't want to fool around.  No, of course not.  But you want to know why he does?  Why, Nora?  Because women do not understand that every man has to have... 
[01:51:00]  What?  One thing.  Ah, poor boy.  Exciting sex.  Right.  Now, wait a minute.  I didn't say love and I didn't say sex.  I said exciting sex.  You're talking about that.  Lust.  Exciting sex.  Exciting sex.  Lust.  And that's what every woman has to learn what to do.  We're not...  And it doesn't have to be hanging from a chandelier or some weird kind of thing.  By the neck.  Every man wants his woman...  Nora, when was the last time you had a good banging? 
[01:51:30]  Ah, Nora.  Oh, that's really personal.  Yes, Opie.  Come on now, Opie.  Somebody hit me over the head yesterday.  No, no, no.  Is that you?  No, you know, Nora's right, though.  You're right, Nora.  Why?  Because it's a matter...  Every guy wants a girl who's going to, like, just worship his mule.  That's nothing wrong with...  There you go.  Worship the mule.  And you want to know something?  I did a survey.  And you want to know what every single man said, 100%.  I did 511 guys that I interviewed from all over the country. 
[01:52:00]  You did 511 guys.  I interviewed them from all over the country.  Oh, you interviewed them.  And every single man said he wanted his wife to take sexual control of his body.  Oh.  Now, isn't that...  Anthony, wouldn't you like that?  Well, they've done it with the checkbook.  Yeah, but we're not talking about...  We're talking about your gorgeous body.  Opie, how about you?  What?  Sexual control of your body.  Wouldn't you love your woman to do that? 
[01:52:30]  She does that, though.  There you go.  She does?  Well, then you're happy.  Then you're not going to...  All right, Nora.  Well, thank you, then.  We'll see you, Nora.  Nora, that's where...  Then I guess we're done.  And I wouldn't.  I wouldn't want a woman to take control of my body.  I like to take control...  I like to spank and pull hair.  Oh, you do, do you?  Well, that's...  You're taking sexual control of her body.  Yeah.  It has to work both ways.  Tell us more, Jim Morton.  Nora, if you catch her getting damp, you spank her harder.  Nora.  Nora.  Nora.  Nora, are you into the yellow discipline?  Oh.  Have you ever heard of the yellow discipline? 
[01:53:00]  No.  Seems to be a fan favorite.  Is it oriental?  It's a salty treat, and it tastes like popcorn.  Oh, I don't know.  Yellow discipline.  You know something that could be...  Let's not say it if you finally realize it.  It's yellow, it's flowing, and it would be considered a certain type of maybe discipline on somebody.  It's warm, and it feels like love.  There you go.  See, Mr. Norton here is very into that sort of thing.  Well, I don't know.  I never heard of it before.  No?  I never heard of it called yellow discipline.  Where's the discipline? 
[01:53:30]  The yellow end of it?  Well, you know, if you're on the receiving end of that, you did something wrong.  Yeah.  You're paying for it.  You're laying back with a mouthful to salty treat, and it's just teaching you a lesson all the way around.  Oh.  Well, you know...  Yeah, you've never had that, Laura?  No, no, but it could be several things.  I don't know exactly what you're talking about.  How about the Cleveland steamer?  I don't know what that is.  You don't know what the Cleveland steamer is?  All right.  That's when the other...  Well, it's steamy.  It's hot. 
[01:54:00]  It's brown.  And it is also dropped from a certain altitude on top of the other significant other.  And it looks like most of the contestants from Cleveland.  Jim.  Oh, Jim.  You've been there, haven't you?  Oh, Jim.  That is terrible.  That's terrible.  Oh, Jim.  Well, let's talk about why guys cheat like Condit and Clinton.  Why do you think these guys are so unthinkable?  Because they were married to an old broad?  No.  Married to sexless troll women like Hillary Rodham. 
[01:54:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'd go along maybe with that.  Yeah.  But you want to know something?  Looks have nothing to do with what turns a guy on.  I'm telling you...  Can't see the face when she's up to your yam bag.  Haven't you ever seen a great-looking guy with a very mediocre or even homely-looking woman?  It has nothing to do with looks.  It has to do with this woman being in charge sexually of this man.  And it really does work. 
[01:55:00]  And this is what my book is about.  So you think if Hillary Clinton would have been more sexually in charge of Bill's body,  that he wouldn't have grabbed Aaron Hummer in the Oval Office.  Absolutely.  Don't you think it's more Bill's problem than Hillary's problem?  No, I don't.  Believe me, I will never, ever defend that bitch that we have as a senator here in New York now,  Hillary Rodham Clinton.  But I have to say, don't you think there might be something that can happen that no matter  how good the girl is, the guy's got a problem that he can't keep his goddamn thing in his 
[01:55:30]  pants.  No.  If Hillary really concentrated, focused on him, and he knew that she really dug him  and that she was really going to give him pleasure every single day, and he knew that,  he absolutely would not fool around with anybody.  One hundred percent.  And that's what women don't understand.  Interesting.  Women think that love, you know, we've been married five, six years, we've got kids,  my husband loves me, he'll never leave me.  Wrong.  I mean, really, women do not understand about the excitement of sex. 
[01:56:00]  Not just having a body.  So when a guy screws around, it's the goddamn bitch's fault there, is what you're saying.  One hundred percent.  Wow.  Oh, I absolutely...  All right, ladies.  Give the number, Opie.  I really believe you.  Wow.  No, no, no.  Don't even...  I like your 1730s thinking.  I don't...  That is not 1730s.  Think of the logic of it.  If a woman takes care of her husband, why would he look outside?  There is no reason.  Because it's nature.  Men want to drop their seeds in as many different places as possible for procreation of the 
[01:56:30]  species.  Not a reason in love.  Is that the excuse you give before you slit their throat?  Yes.  I'm talking about people who are married.  I'm talking about people who are committed.  Not just guys.  All right, Nora.  Okay.  So if you're married and you're in love and the guy strays, it's because the goddamn  bitch didn't...  One hundred percent.  Nora, do you suggest that the ladies give up the balloon knot every once in a while?  That's a kind of weird, wild, exciting thing. 
[01:57:00]  We're talking about the balloon knot.  The balloon knot.  We're talking about the thing.  Well, Nora, let's just say if you were getting it in the balloon knot, you wouldn't be able  to talk much.  Your face would be in the pillow.  You know what I mean?  Oh, now that Jim told me what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  We're talking...  My late husband did that to me once.  I have to tell you.  That's why he's late.  I went to the doctor.  Thanks for the visual, Nora.  You did?  I went to the doctor for years.  It was what Jim is talking about. 
[01:57:30]  He might have led me astray.  You know how it was.  Oh, good for him.  He put you in the hospital?  The pot most was cold, bitch.  Pow!  You went to the doctor.  Oh, wait, what?  You know what pain is?  What was the diagnosis there, Nora?  What was it?  I was all ripped apart.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I don't know whether Jim told you the truth.  He told you the truth.  Was it tough living with a black male?  No.  Did he have a big mule?  Was he a well-endowed man? 
[01:58:00]  Well, all men are well-endowed.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are.  There's a billion Chinese who will hug like children.  They're not well-endowed.  It's not true.  Well, it has nothing to do with how...  Was there any sensitivity or tenderness during that?  Was he using anything?  I was trying to please my husband.  Yeah.  Good for you.  This is something he wanted to try.  Right.  And I will try anything for my beloved.  And I will never, ever do it again.  How long ago was that, Nora, if I may ask?  We really need to know the details.  Two years back?  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  That is great.  Sent it to the goddamn doctor.  He pulled it out and had lining wrapped around it.  It was very painful.  Nora, did he need a stitch or two?  Yeah.  How about that?  No.  No.  It healed by itself, but for a long time.  Did you have to tell your doctor why you were there and what had happened?  I think he knew.  What other reason would it be?  I don't know.  You pushed too hard.  No.  No.  No.  Something.  Charlie Chaplin's in the waiting room.  That's a hot story, Nora.  No, I...  I like the idea. 
[01:59:00]  You going and limping your way to the doctor's office.  Hot story of Bizarro World.  Yeah.  When I'm in love with a man, I'll do anything for him.  Obviously.  Yes.  How about the Roman war helmet there, Nora?  I don't know.  I don't know any of these things.  The Roman war helmet's great.  It's when the girl's laying back on the bed.  And you lay your...  Let's just call them...  You know what's in the yam bag?  We call it the yam bag here on the air.  It's right underneath the actual man's mule.  There's like two cherries in the yam bag.  Right.  You lay each one over an eyeball and lay the man junk down her nose and it looks like a Roman 
[01:59:30]  war helmet.  Centurion.  What is the reason for doing this?  Just to show her that you pay the bills.  Do you take photographs of this?  Well, you could.  Good, clean fun.  You add a little humor to the bedroom there, Nora.  I don't know.  I bet you got the fish eye when the guy was...  I bet you gave him the fish eye before you went to the doctor.  You know what the fish eye is?  It's when the girl's getting it in the balloon knot, like, you know, you that time. 
[02:00:00]  And she turns around after it hurts so bad and gives you that look like a flounder just  pulled in off the...  Into the boat.  You see it.  They kind of look around with that big eye like, hey, hey, what's going on back there?  Actually, he had a stop before.  He had a stop?  Oh.  I must have made him happy.  Oh.  Have you ever had anything like this?  You were Opie or Jim?  No, no.  Da, da, da, da.  No, I mean...  Da, da, da, da.  No, I watch Oz.  I don't mean with...  As close as I want to get.  I don't mean with a man.  I mean anything.  Right.  I mean, have you?  It's extraordinarily painful. 
[02:00:30]  No, no, no.  Just a little finger just tickling me, you know, making me laugh.  Oh, my God.  That really makes you go over.  I'm telling you, you hear...  Little finger.  Pow!  Might as well be a trigger.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Wow, Nora.  Nora, you gave us a lot.  That's cool.  That's cool.  We got Nora Hayden in the studio.  Honest girl.  Number one New York Times bestselling author.  Yay.  How to satisfy a man every time and have him beg for more.  Are you going to give us a few pointers there, Nora?  Anybody that calls in and asks any questions gets a free book. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  Nice.  Either book.  I don't care.  I want to read from your book a little bit, maybe.  Yeah.  Well, you want to know something?  Every man who's read my book and talked to me about it said that this is the only book  that they have ever seen that is the truth that tells about what really men really want.  But, Nora, why would a man read your book?  To find out if what I say is true, and then he would give it to his wife.  Oh, good answer.  These are marriage manuals.  Good answer.  They're supposed to be right. 
[02:01:30]  Let me see.  Give it to his wife.  Yeah, it's heavy enough.  Yeah.  Suck it.  You take the book.  You take Nora's book.  You go, suck it once in a while.  Just read the book and she will want to, but I care of you.  But I feel fat.  You are.  Oh, God.  She only feels fat because you told her she was fat.  Oh.  Oh, look at Nora.  That's not true.  It's not that perception is the only thing.  If you told her how beautiful she was and how gorgeous, she wouldn't feel fat. 
[02:02:00]  Well, she shouldn't be told she's beautiful if she's a big fatty.  She should be told, hey, look, drop a few tons, would you?  Nora, did Jim insult you?  No.  No.  Oh, God.  No, no.  No, he doesn't insult me.  I like Nora very much.  He's adorable.  He looks so much like his father.  That's going to be my best.  I know.  The great John Rickles.  I just wish he wouldn't use it.  I wish he would use another name.  Nora, Nora.  Yeah.  Nora, we got a lot of ladies standing by.  They want to talk to you, get a little advice. 
[02:02:30]  Okay.  We got cheating husbands all over the place.  Are we going to give them free books?  Sure, why not?  Great.  We do have to take a quick break, okay?  Yes.  You want to help us with our Bruce Willis interview as well?  Yes.  Oh, he's darling.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's very much.  You'd like to get with that, right, Nora?  Well, I'd like to be his friend.  I bet you it would allow him to go back into that balloon.  No way.  You wouldn't bang Bruce Willis?  No way.  I only have relationships with people I really like and have commitments.  Obviously, if you're going to have to go to the doctor after. 
[02:03:00]  Only happened once.  His name wasn't Adebisi, was it?  No, no, no.  He was into that, too.  Only happened once.  Never a second time.  All right.  I'm sure that's not my choice.  Pain is not my thing.  His name wasn't Schillinger, was it?  No.  All right.  He's kind of into that, too.  I know a guy named Schillinger that's into the accident.  Nora, I know she's got big cans there.  Wow.  Big cans there where.  Oh, Nora, you're a full-figured gal.  Oh, is that what you're talking about?  Oh, yeah.  We like that.  A lot of girls with a blonde bombshell.  A lot of girls would die for what you got up top there, Nora. 
[02:03:30]  And they're all blind, too.  Yes.  Well, you know, I mean, everybody's built different.  But that doesn't make anybody a better person or a sexier person.  Yes, it does.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  Any chick that's 250 or more is not bangable.  I'm sorry.  A woman can have very small upstairs here.  And she can be very sexy and feel terrific.  Absolutely.  Yeah, if she's selling newspapers in the 1930s.  Absolutely.  Nobody wants to see those little awful, little nub breasts.  Oh, honestly.  Nobody likes that. 
[02:04:00]  Many men are into that, Mr. Norris.  Yeah, they're called homosexuals.  That's right.  That's all it's about.  I will defend that, my friend.  Nothing wrong with a small pair there, Nora.  That's right.  Exactly.  You're absolutely right.  All right.  I think it's Anthony that goes for the big ones.  No, no, not at all.  Actually, Anthony's not.  I like Norm that actually goes for the big ones, but I don't mind the small ones.  I like them big, heavy, and fake.  I like big stripper breasts wrapped around my mule.  That's what I like.  Mouthful of poison.  You get what you pay for.  Look at Nora's weekly basis. 
[02:04:30]  Nora's got those nice lips there.  You got the nice Homer lips there, Nora.  Yes, yes.  My books are marriage manuals.  Marriage manuals.  Right.  That's where the really great sex comes in, where you have a commitment.  I like natural girls, and Nora.  And you know you love each other, Nora.  That's the look.  Do you want to know something, guys?  Nora made her lips extra red today.  Yes, Nora?  I bet you guys don't know that.  What's that, Nora?  You know the greatest part of sex about having an orgasm?  The perfect part is when the woman...  Is when they leave?  Yeah, yeah.  Handing over the money?  ...is when the woman surrenders to her love, and the man surrenders to his wife. 
[02:05:00]  And that is the perfect sex.  Hey, Nora, we've got to take a break.  I think we said that.  Surrender to your mate.  That's right.  And that's when it's perfect.  Heaven.  All right.  Heaven on earth.  Wow, we have a lot of ladies.  We didn't even think ladies listened to the show.  Oh, they're calling.  Mary wants to know how to give a better Hummer.  Does she have any credentials to prove what she's saying?  Yes.  And that's in the book.  Kelly, it's a woman's fault.  That is complete BS.  Wow.  Let me hear the reason.  Valerie, she has no idea what the F she's talking about. 
[02:05:30]  Let me hear the reason.  All right, we'll do that next.  This has got to be reasonable.  All right.  Stay there.  It's Nora Hayden.  I am Dave.  I'm Terry.  Steven.  And we're Jane's Addiction.  It's Jane's Addiction.  You're listening to Opie.  And Anthony.  You're listening to Opie.  And Anthony.  Anthony and Opie.  And you are listening.  And E.W.  Ah, we're hanging with Nora Hayden.  Yay!  Number one New York Times bestselling author.  Talking about her book, How to Satisfy a Man Every Time. 
[02:06:00]  All right, a bunch of girls are pissed off, so let's go right to the phone.  I want to talk to Kelly.  Kelly, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  I just wanted to call and say that this lady, whatever she's talking about, that's a load  of BS.  That it's a woman's fault.  Kelly, I just want you to be rational and don't get angry or emotional.  Oh, okay.  Okay?  Explain it.  I can be rational.  Now.  Tell me what your thinking is.  Okay.  I'm not married, so maybe I'm exempt from your, like, scenario.  I don't know.  Because we're not talking about meeting a guy at a party. 
[02:06:30]  No, no.  This was my...  I'm talking about when you're in love.  When two people are in love and get married, and then three years later, five years, whenever  it is, the guy starts cheating.  I mean, that's what I'm talking about.  Okay.  A committed relationship.  But now, wait a second.  Because my ex-boyfriend...  Yes?  I wanted to give it to him every day.  Did you live together?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I like it.  But you see, I've got to tell you something, Kelly.  But, Kelly, I've got to tell you something.  Oh, she likes the homers.  You were in a committed relationship where you were living together, where he was madly 
[02:07:00]  in love with you, enough to get married to you.  That's a big difference.  You know, a guy can say, listen, I like this girl.  She's terrific.  And I want to go to bed with her all the time.  But until you're married and make that really deep commitment, it doesn't count.  And maybe you gave goofy homers.  I don't see how you could say that 100% of the time, it's the woman's...  What about the other woman?  The whore who comes in and wrecks everything.  Hey, Kelly, Kelly.  There will not be another woman if the man is in love with his wife and she's taking care 
[02:07:30]  of him.  Exactly, yes.  There will not be another woman.  I don't care if the wife is ugly and the woman is gorgeous.  I don't care.  Hey, Kelly.  Did you give up the balloon now with his boyfriend?  I wanted to.  Like the anal monster over here?  Not like that.  Don't call Norah that.  I didn't want to spend any time in the hospital.  Ah.  But I offered.  I offered it.  I wanted to.  You offered it up. 
[02:08:00]  You have a nice body?  You didn't have a really madly in love with relationship with the guy.  Yeah, maybe he just wasn't into it as much as you were.  That's what I'm saying, you see.  Did you smell or anything?  No.  What do you think of the smelly thing there, Nora?  What do I think of what?  When a girl's box smells like Staten Island.  No, no, no, no.  A man and a woman have to take a shower every day.  We're talking about health and cleanliness, for God's sake.  Of course, and that's extremely important.  Soap's not going to get rid of that bacteria sometimes, though, if you know what I'm saying.  No, I don't know what you're saying.  Believe me, cleanliness, very important for me. 
[02:08:30]  Okay.  Bath and everything.  Honest.  Very important, of course.  So, Kelly, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.  How old were you guys at the time?  I was 21.  Oh, my God.  That's the reason.  You were a baby.  There's not many guys out there at 21 who want to settle down.  That's right.  I wasn't expecting.  No, but I'm just saying that how can you blame the woman in the relationship?  What about, like, I mean, a man is a man, and they're going to be attracted to women.  Right.  Plain and simple.  And every girl needs to realize that.  I'll tell you something not true.  And that's what I go into with my book. 
[02:09:00]  I'm telling you right now, if a man is in love with a woman enough to marry her, enough  to make the commitment to live together forever, that man is not going to fool around unless  his wife lets it get boring.  No, no, no.  He doesn't.  I'm not saying that he's going to go out and cheat on her.  I'm saying that every guy is going to be attracted to other women.  Nobody says a guy can't look.  A woman can look, too.  But, Nora, how can you not get boring?  There's only three holes.  It's not just the act, Jim.  Unless you make your own.  Jim, and you have not had a love with a woman. 
[02:09:30]  Two on Nora now.  The husband wrecked that for everyone else.  All I'm saying.  Steer clear of that area.  Especially if she's a two-holer.  What you're saying, though, is that basically you're saying that men have the permission  to do this if they have these kind of women, and that's not fair either.  I don't say they have the permission to do it.  I say they're going to do it.  But it's all the fault.  Kelly, she's just speaking the truth.  It is the truth.  Hey, Kelly, we've got to let you go, because there's so many other ladies and guys that  want to check in.  But thank you for the phone call, okay? 
[02:10:00]  Thanks, guys.  I've got a question for the anal monster.  When your boyfriend put you in the hospital...  Husband, husband.  Husband.  Oh, husband.  Yes.  Did he give you the dirty Sanchez before the ambulance showed up?  You know what the dirty Sanchez is?  No.  I don't know what any of these things are.  Jim has to explain these things to me, and I'm afraid of this one.  How are you going to explain the dirty Sanchez?  He's not explaining it, so there must be something horrible.  Okay, after it's been there... 
[02:10:30]  Have you ever had, like, a milk mustache?  After it's been in that area...  Just imagine chocolate milk.  The painful area?  Things might attach to it, some residue from whence it came from, right?  What he would do is wipe that on your upper lip, giving you a mustache of your own brownness.  He does that because he loves me?  It's called the dirty Sanchez.  I don't know why it's done.  He does it because it looks silly.  It sounds like something a guy would do at a party to a girl. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, what parties do you go to?  Any with Clark Abel back in the day?  A lot of people call that gang rape.  You call it a party.  It doesn't sound like a loving relationship.  No, it doesn't.  Someone wants to comment about what Nora Hayden was saying, okay, Anthony?  Chicks on chicks ain't cheating.  Oh, all right.  All right, our own Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  Mary has a question for Nora Hayden.  Yes, Mary.  Mary?  Hello, boys.  I wanted to know how I could please my boyfriend. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy, that ain't going to work.  That ain't going to work.  Hold on.  We got it done.  Hold on, Nora.  Hold on.  We got a party mouth on the phone.  She said the certain terminology.  The C word?  Yeah, you can't say that.  You can't talk in detail about it.  There are a lot of C words you can't talk about when you're talking about sex.  Just say he finishes too soon, and that'll be fine.  But first, I've got to address Rob from Brooklyn, who said, see Nora starring an angry red balloon  knot.  Funny, funny, funny, funny. 
[02:12:00]  You were great in that movie, by the way.  You know something?  Thank you.  Right after you were on the show last time.  It plays on television.  I went home.  It was on, I think, Bravo or...  AMC.  One of the American movie classics.  It plays the whole time.  And I saw Angry Red Planet, and I saw Nora, and hubba hubba, if I may say, hubba hubba.  Thank you, darling.  23 Skidoo.  Let me tell you.  Thank you, darling.  Thank you.  Was that a talkie?  Quite a looker.  What?  No.  Of course it was a talkie. 
[02:12:30]  You idiot.  It was in color.  Of course it was.  She had quite a set of stems on you.  Let me use the proper terminology of the day.  Thank you, darling.  So now I've got...  What do you call these?  Cans.  Cans.  I thought you meant these things on my ears.  Oh, your headphones.  Yes.  Yeah.  That's what I thought you meant.  Nice rack.  Nice pins.  Anyway, chapter nine of my book goes into...  It's called The Master Plan.  And it talks about how every man...  Elimination of the Jews.  Every man...  Oh, that was Hitler's... 
[02:13:00]  I'm sorry.  That was Hitler's master plan.  I got the book confused.  My fault.  This is how he becomes a sexual master.  Yes.  Every woman, when she falls in love, he becomes her sexual master.  Ah.  So to keep the love really exciting, you have to continue with that.  And I go into all the different kinds of...  Is hummer a bad word?  No.  Okay.  About how to hummer, how to do a hummer.  I go into great detail because it's very important.  The techniques...  Nora, when was the last time you gave one there?  Oh, golly. 
[02:13:30]  What time is it now?  Hey, there you go.  Oh, hey, hey.  Ho, ho, hey.  Firecracker.  Wow, look at that.  I got...  I bet you had to reapply that lipstick before you got here, huh?  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Could we get back to the show here?  Do you have a mirror?  I think there's a little shame on my chin.  Oh, the door's getting me hot.  Easy.  Easy, fella.  You guys are mad.  You're insane.  Easy, fella. 
[02:14:00]  I love it.  Insanity.  Or how about a free tip because, you know...  How about a what?  A free tip.  Tip.  Tip.  Well, I just gave you one.  I just said that the master plan, I mean, that's, you know, really a very important thing.  What's your technique, though?  Do you look up at the guy when you're doing the thing?  Do you...  See, it says the master plan.  How to keep your husband happy and faithful forever.  And we're talking about that, you know, forever.  And can I read this one thing on the back of my book? 
[02:14:30]  All right.  We've all heard often enough that men don't understand women.  But I think it's much more universal that women don't have a clue about the enormous importance of sexual excitement to men.  I didn't say love and I didn't say sex.  I said sexual excitement.  In fact, if a woman can keep her husband sexually excited 10 years, 5 years, 15 years, that man is never going to cheat on her.  And that is 100%.  No exception.  15 years?  I've never had a chick make me want to bang her after the third week. 
[02:15:00]  Well, maybe you should read How to Satisfy a Woman.  Gusting, Jim.  You are disgusting.  Oh, my goodness.  That's the beauty of looking like this.  And your father would be modified.  Is this the man that said he wanted to watch chess?  Is that the man?  Yes.  Yes.  Intellectual giant talking like dirty mouth.  Nor a garbage mouth.  He just wants to see people put the chess pieces where your husband hurt you.  That's all.  You anal monster, you.  And there's no reason a man can't enjoy Gary Kasparov and still think that rape is kind of sexy and hot at the same time. 
[02:15:30]  God.  Kyle, what's up?  I've had it.  Kyle.  Kyle.  Kyle?  Kyle.  Hello.  Kyle, darling.  Hello.  Go ahead, Kyle.  Are you married, Kyle?  Are you single, Kyle?  All right.  Thank you, Kyle.  Jackass.  Let's go all the way down to Oscar.  Oscar, you're next.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to ask a quick question.  Hey, Nora.  I'm about to go out and cheat on my wife. 
[02:16:00]  I was wondering if you could write me a note that says it's okay.  It isn't okay.  You're right.  It's okay.  Just write me a note.  Just write it down.  It's all her fault, okay?  No, it is not okay.  It is absolutely wrong, and your marriage is going to come to an end because of this,  and that's very sad.  No, no, no, no.  That's your fault, too.  Just put it all in the notes.  Just send it to my house.  I appreciate it.  Glad to do it, dude.  Your wife knew how to keep you excited sexually.  You wouldn't think about it.  I'll send her over for you next, Norton.  Take it easy, guys.  All right.  Nora, so when did you decide to give up the balloon knot?  The relationship was going a little bad, and you thought this would be a power play, 
[02:16:30]  or what?  Give it up?  Yeah.  I mean, never do it again?  No, give up, meaning the first time with your husband.  Because he wanted to try it, and I had never done it before.  What a giving woman.  I like that.  I was in love.  And when you're in love, you'll do anything, unless you know ahead of time it's going to  be painful.  Right.  I didn't know.  You'd never dabbled in that area before with any toys or anything?  No, no, no.  No?  No, no, no.  Did you guys talk about it, or did you just kind of climb on while you were passed out?  No, no, no.  We talked about it.  He said this is something he'd always wanted to do. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  I was flattered that he'd never done it before.  That's a hot story.  Hey, how about that?  That's right.  And it was pretty painful.  Oh, my lord.  I don't dig pain at all.  Hey, I think we have a picture of Nora's balloon knot while we were checking it out earlier.  Oh, really?  It really did look like the Red Planet.  Jimmy.  It wasn't.  Oh, hey, Norton.  What's up, man?  Was Mayer on the phone from Metro after you had her go to the doctor's office?  Go ahead, Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  She was a big movie star.  I thought maybe it was back in the day.  Quick question for Nora.  Is the only thing that still gets wet on her is her mouth?  What does that mean?  What?  What did he say?  Nora's a very sexy older broad.  Yes.  Yeah, but it sounds like you're looking at wet on her is her mouth.  What?  I don't understand what he's saying either.  He tried the joke twice, and it failed both times.  I don't think he's saying that.  He doesn't understand it either.  Nora is sexy, though.  You are.  I'm not hitting on you.  You're in sexual.  Thank you, darling.  Thank you.  You must have been a looker.  How about my new movie? 
[02:18:00]  How about my new movie?  Oh, what are you in now?  Oh.  You're in a new movie?  Yeah.  Hollywood royalty, huh?  Well, it hasn't been finished yet, but it's going to be.  There's a lot of big...  What is it?  There's a lot of comic stars called P.K.  Yeah.  You'll see it when you read my book.  You'll see about it.  A lot of...  It's very funny.  You know, monster meets Godzilla.  P.K.  And it's called P.K.  What stars are in it?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Larry Storch.  Oh, he's a big star.  Jackie Mason.  Oh, yeah.  Jackie. 
[02:18:30]  He's got a lot of...  Jackie, yes.  ...people.  Yes.  Jackie Mason made the worst movie in history.  Named?  Caddyshack 2.  Oh, I never saw it.  Yeah, that was bad.  It was the worst comedy ever made.  Had you seen him on stage?  Yeah, he definitely does some funny stand-up.  Hey, you know, the perils of P.K. was, what, 1986?  No, this is P.K.  Okay, because I'm looking at the credits there, and I see Larry Storch is in that.  Yes.  I see Kay Ballard.  Yes.  Joey Heatherton.  Yes.  Louise Lasser. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  They're very funny.  Jackie Mason.  It's like a who's who's list.  Dick Sean, I guess he won't be coming back for P.K.  No.  No, no.  That's the reason we never finished the picture, because Dick was supposed to narrate it,  and it was supposed to direct the movie.  But instead, he was losing a lot of weight.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  But anyway, it's a very funny picture, and we're going to finish it soon, and it's very  cute.  Yeah, weight loss is always funny.  All right.  Keith, what's up?  This is an all-time low.  Why?  It's like my grandmother talking about sex. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, stop it.  Nora.  Come on, dude.  Doesn't this make you just feel dirty?  No.  No.  You should see what we're looking at.  Nora with her big boobies.  She sounds like my grandmother.  Hot red lipstick.  Well, dude, if your grandmother is this sexy, just rip her diaper off and take it.  That's funny.  Nora, you're the best.  You like that, Nora?  Drive it to the doctor.  Norton's okay.  What else do you have to say, sir?  Is he still on? 
[02:20:00]  No.  No, no.  All right.  Nora, give us a little something else here.  What else do I want to say?  Well, let's talk about Mick Jagger.  And let's talk about Condit.  Let's talk about Condit.  All right.  Gary Condit had an affair and then killed that or she's missing.  Any woman.  Any woman.  I stink.  Wow.  Any woman that would let her husband live 3,000 miles away.  That is asking for.  I mean, how can a man not fool around?  You're asking for trouble, right?  If his wife isn't with him. 
[02:20:30]  I mean, isn't that foolish?  So do you think that Bill Clinton is still having sexual affairs away from Hillary?  Absolutely.  Yeah, so do I.  She's not smart enough to realize what she has to do.  Yeah.  All right.  She thinks that she's just, you know, and that's stupid.  Let's go to Lisa.  Lisa, what's up?  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  Nora, I got a question for you.  Uh-huh.  You think to say that it's all the man's job, I mean, the woman's job to be pleasing the man.  What about the man pleasing the woman?  I have a book called How to Satisfy a Woman Every Time and Have Her Beg for More. 
[02:21:00]  Men do not know how to intercourse.  And that tells them exactly what to do to make sure within 10 minutes that the top of your head will come off with an orgasm to intercourse alone.  I like that.  But the old-fashioned way done a little bit different.  And I promise you, you will have the greatest experience you've ever had in your life.  Pull that flapper skirt over your butt.  You know how to make love.  Back in the day.  Intercourse.  And women don't understand how important sexual excitement is to men. 
[02:21:30]  So there it is.  You want to make the top of the head come off?  This isn't just a one-way street.  Yes.  Just a little sex and dealing plot.  Yes, yes.  But, Nora.  Yes.  What about, aside for just pleasing a woman, it's not just about pleasing a woman or a man, I mean, or a woman just pleasing a man.  There's a hell of a lot more involved.  No, there's not.  But we're talking about love.  We're talking about, these are marriage manuals.  And we're talking about people who are madly in love with each other when they got married.  And then they let it die.  All right?  We're not talking about meeting somebody at a party or a bar and just going to bed with them. 
[02:22:00]  These are committed relationships.  Okay, Lisa, have you ever been married?  Yes, I'm actually married right now.  Oh, great.  Okay.  Don't you want your husband to be sexually excited for the rest of your life so he never thinks of another woman?  Hell yeah, but I also think about my own needs.  That's right.  So why don't you have him learn how to get you the greatest pleasure you've ever had so you will never think of anybody else.  Yeah, Lisa, what's the problem with the marriage now?  No problem right now.  I'm just calling to go and say, you know, I figured. 
[02:22:30]  She thought it was wonderful.  I'm hearing Nora.  I'm hearing what she has to say.  It's great.  But I think that aside for a woman having to worry about her man running away, I think a man has to worry about, you know, vice versa.  At 100%.  Thank you.  Very good.  She thought I was talking about a one-way street that was only the man that, you know.  Well, your balloon nut's not a one-way street, huh, Nora?  You ate a monster.  Not anymore.  Ever hear of the double fishhook?  Oh, no.  What is that?  No, that's a good one. 
[02:23:00]  A match from Cleveland just sent it.  It's from the style that you would most see maybe a couple of canines on the street engaging in.  You know that style.  Well, isn't that what my husband did to me?  Right, right.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but only to get a little further into the act, you grab your pinkies and you grab her through the mouth and pull her head toward you.  Oh, my God.  And between the movement and the deepness of things, you'll love it. 
[02:23:30]  Love should never be painful.  The ram is kind of the same thing, only you're banging her head against the wall as you go to get as far as you want to get.  And then the dog in the bathtub, the dog in the bathtub is trying to get everything where your husband hurt you.  We're talking yam bag and everything.  They call it the dog in the bathtub because it's as hard hanging on to her and getting it accomplished as it is holding the dog in the bathtub.  I'm having hysterics here. 
[02:24:00]  Vern, what's up?  Vern.  Vernie.  Dog in the bathtub.  That's a great idea.  Dog in the bathtub.  Vern.  I tried that on Alice last night.  Let's go, Vern.  Yeah, this is Vern.  Vern, I wanted to know, I'm used to using car grease.  I wanted to know if you have any easier way, like special looms I could use on a balloon nut to make it easier.  Vern, chill.  You like the grease that they use?  The car grease, you know.  I want something a little easier.  Maybe Nora can give me a tip on that. 
[02:24:30]  Vern, I don't think you should be doing it.  Tobias doesn't like the car grease.  The balloon nut.  I don't think you should be doing that because it really is painful for me.  Well, you know something, some people like it, Nora.  Well, listen there.  And I don't think you should tell Norton that he should stop accepting that just because it hurt you.  But he's not a masochist.  He doesn't look like a masochist.  Wow.  No, I'm not a masochist.  No.  Did your husband use anything to ease the way a little bit?  No.  Nothing.  No.  Wow.  No wonder it hurt, Nora.  That could have been a problem.  You don't need anything.  It was the first time for both of us. 
[02:25:00]  Ah, let's see.  All right, Lisa wants it.  Go ahead, Lisa.  You don't need anything.  Listen, I have a big problem with her giving sex advice and she can't even take it in the balloon line.  She doesn't even know what the, um, all the terms are that you guys use.  I mean, come on.  Those terms are old.  We like those terms.  They never get old.  No, they're awesome.  They're awesome.  She doesn't even know anything.  She's giving sex advice on the radio.  It's ridiculous.  I went 12 years to Catholic school.  I don't know a lot of expressions.  What about the last 60 years?  What?  What?  What about the last 60 years?  What are you talking about? 
[02:25:30]  She's not 72, Lisa.  All right, Lisa.  Lisa, by the way.  Thanks, guys.  Lisa?  Lisa?  I, I...  Oh, sugar hope.  I'm sorry.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if you guys had some, uh, audio from when Nora got it in the balloon  app.  Oh, you know, I think we might.  Uh, yeah, we were recording back then, weren't we, Ant?  Yes.  On reel-to-reel tapes, I believe.  Uh...  It wasn't that long ago, guys.  No.  Five years.  No.  No?  Maybe...  Wait, when did...  Yeah.  Oh, I think they had, uh, cassettes then. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I was hoping you were going to say 30.  Jeff from Cleveland says the movie she's in isn't called PK, it's called KY, and it should  go along with your balloon app.  Sir, what do you mean?  Oh, hi, baby.  Ah.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah.  Well, let's go to Joe.  Joe, you have a question for Nora?  Oh, yes, Nora.  When you were in the hospital, did you...  She wasn't in the hospital, she went to the doctor.  Oh, okay, my fault.  When you went to doctor, whatever doctor it is, did your balloon app look like an avocado 
[02:26:30]  after it was run over by a tractor trailer?  I don't know, you know.  Would you stop?  I couldn't see it.  Thank you, guys.  Later.  But you want to know why everybody who's listening knows all these expressions?  Why?  Because they listen to you every day.  Right.  He kills them all the time.  Nora, you ever get the pinch pot...  The pinch pot mudworks?  What's that?  Jim doesn't know what it is.  It's the rusty trombone on a woman.  What's it called? 
[02:27:00]  Pinch pot mudworks.  Jim, explain it to me.  You pinch the pot and you work the mud.  I never heard...  What does it mean, Jim?  You ever hear the rusty trombone, Nora?  No.  Your husband would have loved this if he liked that backdoor action.  It's when you use the balloon knot like you would the mouthpiece on a trombone, right?  You go...  And you put your hand around the front, the reach around, and you work that like a slide trombone. 
[02:27:30]  And you go...  The woman with the man, right?  It's called the rusty trombone, yeah.  Because on a woman, it's called the pinch pot mudworks.  Oh!  That's where you pinch the pot and work the mud.  Who wants to be pinched?  Who?  Not I.  I don't know.  No, you're not into the pain thing, are you?  No, I am not into pain.  I am into great, super pleasure.  Norton's got a show that he's packing just talking about this.  You're a sexy guy, Norton.  Oh, yes, Norton. 
[02:28:00]  Say that, but sarcastic.  Yeah.  Can you believe Don Rickles' kid?  I know.  He looks just like him.  Yes, I know.  And he's just as funny, probably funnier.  He is.  Well, back in the day, Rickles was knocking him left and right, I'll tell you that.  He was very funny.  Well, he was a big one with the women, too, because that woman that, well, no, he was  because the woman that actually he had Norton with is not his wife, because I guess his wife  was, yeah.  I didn't know that.  Hey, there's a lady agreeing with Nora.  Let's go to Nikki.  Ah!  Nikki! 
[02:28:30]  Hey!  Hey!  What are you guys doing?  I'm talking to Nora here.  Having fun.  How are you?  Nora!  Hi, Nikki.  Hey!  I've got to tell you, I agree with what you're saying.  Yeah, yeah!  Nikki, the only intelligent person who's called so far.  Oh, wow.  Nikki, I'm sending you a free copy of my book.  Cool.  Oh, wait a minute.  Are you in New York?  Yeah.  Well, why don't you, let's see, I'll leave it with the people at the desk.  Maybe you can come up and pick it up one day in the next couple days?  Well, no, I'm not from New York there.  I'm too far away from New York. 
[02:29:00]  Where?  I'm in Lindenville.  Yeah, Nikki, we're going to have to mail the book to Nikki.  How to satisfy a man every time and have him beg for more.  That's what I want.  Okay, well, we'll mail it to you.  Will you let, who can she tell her address to?  Earl?  Yeah, we'll figure that part.  Hey, that's good.  I want you to have the book, Nikki.  Okay.  Because you will appreciate it.  All right, we'll figure that part out.  We'll figure the whole mailing thing when we put her on hold there.  Wait, wait, can we check postage real quick on the air?  What's that? 
[02:29:30]  All right, Nikki, hold on, all right?  Okay.  All right.  I like Nikki.  Now, she's an intelligent woman.  Well, Dave has something to say to me.  Oh, here comes Dave.  Yeah, Dave.  Dave?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  All right, well, we're talking to Nora here.  Hey, you know what Nora's underwear tastes like?  What?  Well, it depends.  Oh, stop, Nora, you're not wearing a, you're right, stop it.  So, that's really, come on, don't imply that her husband pulled out his mirror.  And it smelled like baby wipes.  That's really inappropriate. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, I wasn't implying.  No, you didn't.  It was kind of hot and worked up.  I was just guessing.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, well.  The intellect of some of these callers is like, uh.  They're funny, though, man.  There's some funny people.  Some of it was funny.  It's hot and hard work.  Yeah, I think we have audio of Nora and her husband.  Oh, good.  You're going to play it?  Yeah.  Oh, let's hear it.  Oh, great.  Okay.  Am I screaming?  This is when he was ripping your, uh, you know what there.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Listen. 
[02:30:30]  Use it or lose it.  I, uh, I don't like it, so I, uh.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[02:31:00]  I, uh...  You know what that's called?  Hey, we'll do it to you.  You know who that is?  That's called...  You want to know what it's called?  It's called faking it.  She was faking every second.  Oh, my God.  So, Buddy Epson?  No, are you trying to tell me that you could tell the difference between a fake orgasm and a real one?  One hundred percent.  Wow.  Have you ever faked it before, Noor?  Of my whole life until I learned how the man should do it.  You know what?  Oh, God, it was...  It's impossible.  You faked it?  The man doesn't know the technique.  Every woman faked it.  Nora, I bet you couldn't do a fake orgasm right now. 
[02:31:30]  I'll bet I couldn't either.  You're an actress.  That's true.  A very good actress.  Who wants to hear Noor do a fake orgasm?  I would.  I would.  The whole room wants to, Noor.  I know.  And I see in my brain here, a lot of listeners on the roadways, they're screaming at their radio that they would love to hear this.  Do you want to know something, guys?  Come on, Noor.  You know, when Harry met Sally, this is honest to God, true.  A friend of mine was a writer on the show.  They got the whole idea from that because How to Satisfy a Woman was the first book ever written that talked about women faking it. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Nobody ever talked about it before.  Nora?  No.  Never.  And that's where they got the whole idea from it.  Who?  Nora, baby?  Yes, darling.  Could you do a fake orgasm for us, please?  I really don't know how.  It would make our show.  Oh, I don't know.  Even for like 20 seconds.  I don't know.  How about a real one?  Could you pull that off?  Nora, Nora, if you will, please.  I just don't know how to do it.  For 10 or 15 seconds.  I haven't faked it for so many years.  I don't remember.  Really? 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  Come on, Nora.  Just a few little moments.  A few little moments.  I don't know how to do it.  We could just lay her.  Close your eyes.  Shake your head back.  And talk to her a little bit.  Opie, you do it first.  No, I ain't going to do it.  No, no.  They'd rather hear a girl.  You guys do it.  Anthony, you do it.  And you seem to be the only girl here, so.  You do it first and then I'll do it.  No.  Like Nora said, it's like, ugh.  Come on, Nora.  I don't know how to do it.  Just know how to do it.  Nora, how do you used to do it?  I don't remember.  Back in the day before you were putting me on the phone.  If I do it, will you do it?  I'll do it first.  Nora, I promise we will sell a million of your books if you do a little fake or not. 
[02:33:00]  We will push this book.  We'll give it a lot of heat.  We'll put it over the top.  Well, Norton, let's see you do it.  All done.  That's easy.  It doesn't have to be long.  I could do that.  All right.  Go ahead, Nora.  Okay, that's easy.  A little more.  Come on, baby.  Oh, yeah.  All done.  Wow.  All right.  I can see how that could have built up into something good, though.  Yeah.  Let's just imagine how, you know, the blue knots involved. 
[02:33:30]  How would that sound?  That was very painful.  I'm not a screamer with the pain.  I just had him stop when it got excruciating.  Wow.  No, I wasn't a screamer.  I didn't scream.  I'm not vocal.  I'm not vocal.  Actually, I hate to tell you, but we do have the audio.  We had a microphone in the room that...  Well, you just played it, I thought.  No, no, no.  That was Sandy Kane.  It wasn't even that one.  Yeah.  Here, here.  God, it does sound like me. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, Lord, you're a hoot.  Oh, Lord, that was great.  Yeah, there you go.  Where'd you get that from?  Yeah, well...  Oh, they're just a...  We have a whole virtual smorgasbord of sounds.  A bevy, yes. 
[02:34:30]  A bevy.  It's a bevy.  Yeah.  I thought maybe you had a recorder under my bed.  Oh, it might have sounded like that, huh?  Right.  Actually, I think one thing was left out, though.  Oh, God.  Oh, how disgusting.  Okay, terrific.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar. 
[02:35:00]  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  Vulgar.  I thought it was good.  Vulgar. 
[02:35:30]  Vulgar.  No, they were punching now.  Anthony, I got audio of the husband after the deed.  Fuck it off, dick.  And it looks like Noor did this deed in public.  No, stop it.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of people watching.  All right, Noor.  Yeah.  That was good. 
[02:36:00]  Isn't that fun?  It was weird.  Good, clean fun.  It was weird.  It's a little weird, right.  Yeah, but I like weird.  Yeah, we're all weird.  I like nutty weird.  I'm big dick black.  Do you know, I have these neighbors that have a little kid, and the kid said he wanted to watch for his birthday.  He wanted to watch what?  So they let him.  That was my joke.  Oh, Opie, why do you ruin all of my jokes?  That's the second joke.  All of my jokes.  You suck, Opie.  That was the second pre-war joke you stepped on. 
[02:36:30]  It was not.  It's a new joke.  Yeah.  You better call up Rich Voss.  A little kid wanted to watch, and they said if we'd walk two more miles, we'd have all the views.  Smash Voss.  That Voss joke.  Oh, wow.  Well, we're going to take a break.  Let's do that.  And then we'll be back with Nora Hayden.  Yeah.  Can I get my 888 number?  Oh, please.  We wouldn't have it any other way. 
[02:37:00]  No, I'm turning it on, Nora.  Why?  No.  Why?  No, you can't.  Why?  No, no, no.  What's the problem?  See, you've got to learn on this show, Nora.  You give us a little something, we give you a little something.  I did.  I did it.  I did it.  You forgot.  No.  Your memory's going.  No, you gave a two-second fake-off.  That's what he gave.  That's what Norton gave.  You give us ten seconds, you give the phone number up.  I don't plug on the show ever.  Just imagine all...  Yes, you do.  You plug where you're going to be doing your comedy.  No, I don't.  You never do?  No.  Where are you this weekend?  I heard you on the phone now.  He doesn't know.  I'm just doing certain gigs, nothing major. 
[02:37:30]  I don't need to plug.  That's not what this show is.  Nora.  Okay.  Nora, ten seconds of a fake orgasm.  It's for the phone number.  Look, I would eat a bullet for this show.  Nora, it's for the phone number.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ew.  Ten seconds.  I did it.  Yeah.  I did it.  Let's get a crash card in here.  All right.  888-45-NORA.  N-A-U-R-A. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  This is great.  The last one.  I just got to get one more out.  The gummy bear.  I don't know why.  It's easily performed on a sleeping grandmother.  While the old bag is in a pharmaceutical haze with her teeth in a glass, straddle her  wrinkled bug and jam your naughty boy down her throat.  That is so disgusting.  Blowing your jack down her withered esophagus.  If she wakes up, just tell her she forgot to take her pill and you were helping her. 
[02:38:30]  Nora?  The fun variation on this is to turn around just as she wakes up, put her tent just in  your balloon knot and start screaming like, screaming at her like a wild talking a-hole.  Which, of course, you are.  God damn, is that funny.  Calm down.  She thinks I'm washing her.  The Opie and Anthony F. U-Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me. 
[02:39:00]  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E-W.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hanging with Nora Hayden, Anthony.  Whee!  Well, I got a couple of more things maybe you've heard of, Nora.  You ever heard of Palm Sunday?  No.  Sunday is spelt like Sunday.  Like, uh, not the day.  80.  Yeah, like, uh, what G? 
[02:39:30]  It's dumb when you have a girl who doesn't want, um, uh, the stuff on her face.  Just say she doesn't want stuff byproduct on her face.  Your revenge is that you, um, you get the stuff after you're done in your hand and you  smack her in the face with it.  It's called a Palm Sunday.  Get it?  There you go.  Less painful than the A.  Nora, some dude from New Hampshire.  More disgusting, though.  Oh, sure.  A guy from New Hampshire writes, uh, has Nora ever done the mushroom tattoo? 
[02:40:00]  The mushroom?  That's one I've never heard of.  The mushroom tattoo.  Well, uh, the mushroom tattoo is, um, well, a guy slapping his, uh, his, uh, on a girl's  face hard enough to leave a mark.  Shaped like a mushroom.  Oh, you smack her with your junk so hard that it leaves the shape of a mushroom on her cheek.  Why would it be a mushroom?  Well, Nora, it depends on what part of the world you're from.  Well, uh, Nora, um, uh, these days, uh, circumcision's running rampant. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, okay.  You know, so, if, if you kind of clunk, you know, it would leave that mushroomy, kind  of a bulbous, and then a, well.  Oh, okay.  The delicious mushroom.  I guess I was thinking of the wrong kind of mushroom.  There are different kinds of mushroom, of course.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Sounds beautiful.  Christy.  Yeah.  What's up, Christy from Cleveland?  Nothing.  What are you doing?  You might remember my work with Nora Hayden. 
[02:41:00]  Hi, I'm Troy McClure.  Do you know, I'm the one that queefs for, um, Dennis Leary, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Y'all announced me as Christy, but I'm Christy.  Christy.  Yeah.  Christy.  Hey, Nora, do you know what a queef is?  No.  Wow.  Nora.  Queef?  Queef.  No.  Uh, Christy, would you like to do one?  I would love to do one.  God, the 6 o'clock queef thing is, uh, dying on us.  I know.  It's 6.40 and we finally got one.  All right.  Y'all have to let me come when y'all come to Cleveland. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Sure.  I'm scared of what she was saying, man.  For a second.  All right, Christy, hold on.  We've got to get the little theme song here.  Okay.  All right, here it is.  It's happening.  It's not a burp.  It's not a fart.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  You get it yet, Nora?  No.  Blow out the candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart, but smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  All right, Christy, are you ready? 
[02:42:00]  I'm ready.  All right, everyone be quiet.  Yeah, be very quiet, Norm.  Listen more.  Okay, this is champion material now.  Okay, Christy from Cleveland.  You ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  That was fantastic.  Thank you.  Bravo.  It's not a purpose.  Yeah.  It's not too sweet.  It's not too tart.  It's 6 o'clock.  It's time for a queef.  You get what it is now?  No.  Candles, make a wish.  It's like a fart.  It smells like fish.  It's 6 o'clock. 
[02:42:30]  It's time for a queef.  Yeah.  Undo your pants.  Let them drop to the floor.  That was a good one.  Dance up and let yourself roar.  Queef.  How good was that one?  Nice, right?  Nora, you know what that is, right?  Yeah.  It's a sound made from a place that your husband should have left, like, kept doing it.  Yes.  A really good one sounds like a fist being jammed into a bucket of lard.  Oh, God.  See, that's coming from, that's not coming from ordinarily where you would think you would  hear that sound.  Yeah.  Nora, would you like to give that a try?  Yeah.  Nora, that's...  I don't think I could do that. 
[02:43:00]  That's coming from the front side.  When you're doing a little leg lift and it makes the noise, you go, whoops.  Never happens, you don't go, whoopsie, whoopsie-daisy.  Let me go to Debbie.  Debbie, what's up?  Debbie.  Hi.  Yes, hi.  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to tell Nora that my husband and I got the book on how to satisfy a woman  and it was fantastic.  Really?  Thank you.  You're getting how to satisfy a man now. 
[02:43:30]  Well, I've been looking all over for it.  I think I've been in every Barnes & Noble in the tri-state area and haven't been able to  find it.  Maybe they're sold out.  I can't understand.  Every store has them.  Debbie, we're going to put you on hold.  Okay.  I'm so glad that you love it.  You want to give the guys a little tip out there, Debbie?  A little tip.  Well, I think they'll have just as much fun as the women.  I mean, it's not anything that is a chore for them to do.  Let's put it that way.  It's very exciting, isn't it?  It's as pleasurable for a man as it is for a woman. 
[02:44:00]  Isn't it exciting for you?  Yeah.  It was great.  Hold on, Debbie.  We'll send you the book.  Okay.  Thank you.  Wow.  There goes Debbie.  Great.  Yay.  Fantastic.  That's what I say.  Let me go to Angel who has a question.  Angel.  Wow.  Angel.  Hey.  Hi.  Hi.  I agree with you 100%.  Thank you, Angel.  But I'm not in control.  My man controls me.  What?  Oh, your man controls you?  Well, you want to know something, Angel?  It can't be one-sided or that would start to sort of get boring to him. 
[02:44:30]  But what if I love it one-sided?  Well, you might, and I'm sure you do.  But he, after a while, it would get a little boring if he's always in control.  It's not boring now.  Now, not for you, of course, but I'm saying, wouldn't it be great if every other time you  were in control, wouldn't that give him a really exciting time?  I don't know.  I'd have to ask him if I was allowed to be in control.  Oh, yeah.  This could be a guy.  I'm just waiting for her to talk again. 
[02:45:00]  It takes time and it's very exciting.  Angel, how old are you?  28.  28, and you're a girl, right?  Yes, of course she is.  Yes.  Well, you don't know the show.  Sometimes the guys call up and they talk.  Oh, not with that voice.  She's very sexy.  Well, you never know.  She's got a wonderful voice.  No, I do know the show and I'm definitely not a guy.  Yes.  No, she doesn't sound like a guy.  Hey, Angel, would you like to show Nora how a fake orgasm is done?  No, actually, I don't even know if I'm allowed to be making this phone call. 
[02:45:30]  I didn't ask.  I might get in trouble.  Yeah, you probably will be.  Norton, would you stop working your junk?  Angel, I got it.  Hi, Norton.  Turn to the right, Norton, and make that go away.  Good girl.  Are you going to read How to Satisfy a Man, Angel?  I think I'm doing it already, I hope.  All right.  No, you're doing what?  I think I'm satisfying someone already.  No, but I mean, don't you want to learn about how to do the reverse?  Yes, I would love your book.  The reverse?  I would love to send it to you.  All right, hold on, Angel.  There goes Angel.  All right. 
[02:46:00]  Very sexy voice.  Oh, she's hot.  Look at that, Nora.  But she's...  Oh, honestly.  Oh, Jim.  That's terrible.  Why is that terrible?  That's terrible.  She's proud of that.  It's a lot...  Nora, what do you think?  See, Angel is...  Wait, Nora, what do you think of what Jim's packed in there?  I can't believe you showed up.  I think he's got a gun in his pocket.  No, it's not.  No, it's shooting disease, baby.  I want to talk about Angel for a second. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  You see, her guy is in charge of her, and she's very masochistic, and he's sadistic, and she likes that.  But that's going to get boring for him.  It won't get boring for her, but now, every once in a while, he has to have her in control for it to stay exciting for him.  No, he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  The conversation was hot when Angel was on the phone.  Hey, Nora, why don't you give out the number for your book, because we're running out of time.  Yes, give out that number.  Okay, it's 888-45-NORA, N-A-U-R-A, for both books. 
[02:47:00]  And I have a website, which is, what is it, Nora, N-A-U-R-A.com.  Nora.com.  That's really easy, right?  Yeah, it's really easy.  I just want everybody to know.  Nora, did you learn anything on the show today?  Yes, I did.  What did you learn?  I learned a lot of things.  I learned about the mushroom.  Right, the mushroom tattoo.  I learned about the quiche.  The quiche, sure.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  If you do it in a restaurant, yeah.  Quiche, quiche.  And I learned about the balloon.  I learned about the balloon.  Mud patch, what was it?  The balloon with a... 
[02:47:30]  Balloon knot.  Mud works.  Balloon knot, I learned about that.  Pinch pot mud works.  Mud works, yeah.  I don't even understand that.  Neither do we, but it's very funny to just say.  That's too long to remember for me.  The balloon knot, that I remember.  Yeah.  What are some of the other things that I've forgotten?  There were so many.  My God, I never heard so many.  One thing you didn't forget is that up the A story.  Yeah, that was pretty nice.  Speaking of...  Thank God you didn't forget that.  That's the balloon knot.  Speaking of which, George said he learned that Nora's first husband's name was Rip Torn.  Oh, is that cute? 
[02:48:00]  That's pretty funny.  A little wacky.  Rip Torn is a very talented guy.  Hey, Craig from New York, real fast, very basic scenario.  Married a thin woman, now have fat wife, never have sex.  What to do?  Well, she has to...  Poison her food.  She has to get healthy, for God's sakes.  I mean, that's terrible.  Somebody that's grossly overweight...  Right.  She probably has a problem walking up and down stairs.  Yeah, with sandals.  You ever see a chick with a big, fat hump of feet?  Like, a little big, fat feet?  Yeah.  Like, the top of the foot looks like a...  Yeah.  Oh.  With baking bread. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And it just kind of puffs out of the top of the bread mold.  You want to just rub your mule all over the top of that fat foot and then cut it off and  stab her?  I mean, I'm just talking like...  Do you want to know why people are grossly overweight?  Because they have food allergies.  And they eat stuff and it makes them addicted.  Oh, don't give people an excuse.  No, it's not an excuse.  Make them stop eating.  They can't.  They're addicted.  Same as drugs.  You have to realize that it's an addiction and you have to then stop eating things like  wheat and corn and rice and things that you're addicted to. 
[02:49:00]  Isn't that everything?  Yeah.  No.  All right, listen.  We got a lot of great...  What do we learn today?  All right.  So, we should start.  By the way, Tuttle from New York writes, today I learned that though Bruce Willis might  be one of the biggest stars of all time.  The star of PK is far more important than him on the air.  Yeah.  For some reason, Bruce Willis didn't call in today.  Thank you.  Yay.  We always have a problem when we announce who's going to call the show.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, they cancel.  Why didn't he?  Because C-blockers get to him.  We got C-blockers all over the trail.  They don't like them being on our show. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe if something this important came up and he'll do it another day.  Hopefully.  I bet you he's a nice guy.  He seems like a problem.  All right.  Listen, we're going to go to the phones and start with Sean because we only have a couple minutes  to play.  What did we learn on the O&A show today?  Sean, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I learned that Nora should have starred in the Angry Red Astumpier.  Astumpari.  Astumpari.  Astumpari.  Astumpari.  Yeah, Nora likes it in Astumpier.  So, Nora, when you got this in Astumpier and had to go to the Doctuary, did it hurt? 
[02:50:00]  What was the treatment for your Domplar?  Extraordinarily painful.  I couldn't eat peanuts.  Did he give you a little Novocaine?  I wouldn't eat any peanuts or any kind of things like that for, like, five years.  Five-year injury?  Oh, it was terrible.  There was a five-year trauma done to your balloon nut?  What?  Did he strap a chainsaw to his mule?  It was terrible.  It was really terrible.  Wow.  Condoms those days were made out of chain mail.  Did you have to sit in a little hard to a...  There was no condoms.  Did you have to sit on an inner tube in a pool for five years? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  How was the...  What was the treatment?  What did the doctor do to you?  No, he just...  I don't even remember.  It was, like, very painful.  Did you have to bend over and take a look?  Take a little look.  Was your husband an actor or anything?  No, he was a film distributor.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Listen, let's...  It's a wonderful film.  Cass from Long Island.  I learned that it's now the Opium Red Buttons show.  Bleacher Anthony writes, I learned that Fat Barbie doesn't come with self-esteem.  No.  She C-blocks Ken, and her purpose is to sit in a corner and watch Skinny Barbie have fun.  Al Mack from Clifton. 
[02:51:00]  Today I learned that at midnight, two-vote girl will become three-vote girl.  Don't forget to vote every day for the Naughty Nighty contest.  Yes.  Opium Anthony.com.  We've got to get the 98 contestants down to 20 by Monday, and you can vote every day.  Look at Jay from Boston.  He learned syndication doesn't mean hot chicks will pay attention to you.  Life stinks.  Yes.  You learned that today.  The dude from Alabama listening underground.  I learned today that Fat Barbie's self-esteem is sold separately, entering Zima while watching  figure skating, and a Roman war helmet is good for demonstrating who pays the bills. 
[02:51:30]  Bleacher Anthony again.  Today I learned that two-man luge is worse than Oz.  Jerry from Madison.  I learned Oz is a cross between scared straight and days of our lives.  If you catch her getting damp, spank her harder.  If Hillary paid attention, Monica would be an unknown in a clean blue dress.  Yay!  Yes!  And there's only three holes unless you make your own.  Whatever that means.  That's an old... 
[02:52:00]  I want this.  One...  I like your laugh, Nora.  Three.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That orgasm did kind of sound like Helen Roper.  It sounded like you.  It sounded like you.  I did you.  Nora, you were such a fine guest today.  Why don't you give out that number again?  Oh, my goodness!  888-45-NORA, N-A-U-R-A.  And the website is Nora, N-A-U-R-A dot com.  And it has all my books in it.  And the two books are?  How to satisfy a woman every time and have her beg for more. 
[02:52:30]  Guaranteed within ten minutes your wife will have an...  And how to satisfy a man every time and have him beg for more.  Well, you really stretched on those titles.  That's right.  That's right.  They tell you to take something that makes me...  Superman and Superman 2.  All right, Nora, thank you.  That was fun, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Let's hear it for the anal monster, everyone.  And I'm sending my poster, too.  All right.  And I want to see it hanging in your office.  All right.  Yes.  Right next to our Britney Spears poster. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Friends of the Opie and Anthony show stay at the Park Central Hotel here in Midtown Manhattan.  1-800-346-1359.  Winter rates starting at 1-59.  The Opie and Anthony show.  And E.W. </pre>
