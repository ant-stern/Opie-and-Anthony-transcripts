<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a highly skeptical discussion surrounding a purported interview with a Playboy Magazine representative, "Cindy."  Opie, Anthony, Cal, Bill Bill, Jim Norton, and several callers questioned the interviewer's authenticity due to her unprofessional behavior (removing shoes, sniffing feet, suggestive questioning), vague answers regarding her employment, and overall inexperience.  The hosts fabricated sexually explicit stories and fetishes, further highlighting their doubts. Attempts to verify Cindy's identity through a Playboy contact and phone calls proved unsuccessful initially, but a call with Jay Moore helped confirm their suspicions that the interview was a hoax.  Cindy eventually called back, revealing herself as a freelance writer pitching a story, explaining the inconsistencies. The hosts invited her to the studio.

The show then transitioned to a darkly comedic segment about the inappropriateness of carnival rides based on tragedies.  Callers and the hosts brainstormed increasingly offensive ride ideas centered around events like the Columbine shooting, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Princess Diana. This segment featured Sandy Kane, a studio guest with a large genital growth ("Twato"), which became a focal point of crude and sexually suggestive commentary from the hosts and callers. Other guests included Jay Moore, Jim Norton, and the off-site Garrett Morris. Anthony's brother, Brother Joe, contributed a song written on a cocktail napkin, and Anthony played a recording of his intoxicated mother singing "Mercedes Benz," which was heavily mocked.

Anthony's mother's disastrous singing performance was a significant recurring theme.  Comparisons to Janis Joplin and a "crack-addled Joan Rivers" were made. The segment flowed into the "FU Line," featuring angry listener messages, followed by a diamond sponsor advertisement.  Anthony's mother then called in to defend her singing, blaming the poor audio quality.  A recording of Nancy Kerrigan singing "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" was played for comparison. Garrett Morris then appeared in the studio, discussing his new movie "Jackpot," leading to a discussion about man boobs and the reappearance of Sandy Kane, whose body was the subject of further sexually explicit commentary and a partial striptease.  The segment concluded with more discussion of Garrett Morris's career and a shooting incident he survived, Brother Joe's George Harrison parody, listener calls, the GoldenPalace.com and Dr. Gregory Pistone-sponsored man-boob contest, and advertisements for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.

The man-boob contest itself involved a large man with significant breast development, whose physique became the target of numerous crude jokes and comparisons to Sandy Kane's breasts, Joe Weider protein drink commercials, and Santa Claus.  His measurements (6'2", approximately 350 pounds) were shared.  Studio guests included Jay Moore, with Pat, Garrett Morris (possibly off-site), and Jim Norton mentioned. Brother Joe's contributions were also acknowledged.  The broadcast continued with listener calls offering humorous "What Did We Learn Today" observations, mostly relating to the show's vulgar and sexually charged content.  Throughout the broadcast,  advertisements for Sam Adams beer and Pinnacle Horny Goatweed were also aired.  The show also mentioned a $300 tax rebate check and the story of a murdered Good Samaritan.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P. Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We have so many meetings and things to do before this show.  Gonna run in and get everything set up.  Yeah, we got a story to tell, I think.  First of all, we got Cal Bill Bill sitting in today.  And our buddy Jim Norton over there as well. 
[00:00:30]  Where do we begin with this story?  What?  We had an interview today.  Another interview.  We had an interview with Playboy Magazine today.  What do you think?  I think we've been had.  You think?  I have to go on the record and say that, so in case this doesn't come about, we covered our bases.  Yeah.  But this hot piece of ass, supposedly from Playboy, shows up to do the interview. 
[00:01:00]  Right, Ben?  Ben's giggling like a schoolgirl because he noticed that I noticed that she was hot.  I thought maybe, like at first, my first impression was, all right, they're doing a cute thing at Playboy.  They're going to let one of the girls from Playboy interview us.  Right.  Because she was very hot.  I think we were just interviewed by a possible stalker of the radio show.  It needs to be said.  I don't know what she was.  She was hot. 
[00:01:30]  Ben.  What?  Was this lady from Playboy?  I don't know.  I thought so.  You don't care.  Who cares, anyway?  I mean, do we really care at this point?  I don't know.  With sales guys crashing into walls upstairs, Eddie drooling.  Yes, you walked in, and one of the sales guys walked into a wall looking at her.  Walked right into a wall.  And me and Oprah are going up to the interview, so we're walking up the stairs, and it's another one of these, you know, like,  all right, let's run through all this same crap again with these rioters, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:02:00]  Here we go.  Same questions.  Hey, how did you guys meet?  Who the F cares?  Right.  Who the U cares?  Ready to see some guy standing there?  Do your homework.  It's been said in a million articles.  Who cares how we met?  How'd you guys get together?  Well, Anthony had this band on Long Island, and I was a dopey radio guy, and we asked for song.  I don't know.  Enough of that.  If I got to tell that gag one more time.  But we didn't mind telling her today, because this girl is a piece of ass.  So we walk up the stairs, and all of a sudden, she's standing up there, and we're dragging 
[00:02:30]  our feet, like, oh, God, another interview, same questions.  Look at us being jaded already.  And then it's like, hi.  Oh, hey, how you doing?  No, no, no, no.  Opie's demeanor changed faster than I've ever seen you.  From not, you guys were on Ron and Fez.  You guys came up.  Anthony and Kyle was like, you weren't paying any attention.  You went from, like, whatever to the biggest smiley face.  Hey, I'm Opie.  Like, it was the funniest.  Nice to meet you.  Hey, look at you. 
[00:03:00]  But then we go into the conference room, and, oh, this is another little tip thing.  We're getting little bits of information that are coming together in our brain as we put  this puzzle together.  She goes, oh, conference room?  That's so, like, corporate.  What?  Can't we do it in your office?  Like, no, no, you don't want to see the office.  Yeah.  Remember that?  I forgot about that.  So, I guess we need someone from the inside at Playboy to please call us and tell us that  this is legit. 
[00:03:30]  I'm going on record.  I'm saying it's not legit.  Oh, you are?  Oh, yeah.  I'm waiting.  I'm holding back.  Ben, you have any proof that this girl was legit today?  Maybe in an old email.  An old email?  Well, I'm holding back.  I'm going to wait and see.  So, she sits down to interview us, and she says, well, I've never done this before.  You know, your first article you get to write is for Playboy magazine? 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Usually, you know, you've got to write for some crappy magazines.  So, let me tell you where my head's at.  If any guy in the world would say that in the conference room with us, I'd be like, oh,  you know, I just remembered I have to do something.  This ain't school.  I'd be so out of that conference room, but she's hot.  I'm like, ah, what the hell.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Right.  It's like, this isn't school.  This isn't interview school.  If she was writing for the Asbury Press or something, I'm just throwing a publication  out there, a really lame publication out there, and said, I've never done this before. 
[00:04:30]  Well, that's possible.  All right.  She's got her start in journalism.  She's working for this crappy paper, the Asbury Press.  And she's doing an interview about you and I and our lovely radio show.  Then that would be believable, right?  I know.  Playboy.  Playboy.  I've never done this before.  So she pulls out her brand-new microcassette recorder and pops it on the table and starts  asking us questions.  Right. 
[00:05:00]  The first few were very similar to ones that we've had before.  Sure.  On this show.  How'd you get together?  What's the appeal of the show?  You know, all those questions, Opie, that I give those boring answers to as per tool-ass  dick-sea douche guy from time.  Joel Stein.  Right.  So you're not looking on the other side of that time interview, Anthony?  Oh, I'm not?  No.  You only had the other side.  The other page?  It wasn't us.  No.  You had one quote?  Yeah.  I had many, many quotes?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  Yeah.  This is where I'm thinking. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  No one's going to remember my stupid quotes.  They're always going to remember the fact that Anthony said the Olsen twins are hot in  Time magazine.  That's true.  All right.  They could care less about my radio gibberish that I threw at Joel Stein.  Whatever.  You had a great line, and that's what's going to be remembered in that article.  Jack tool.  Yeah.  So she starts with those questions, and then it gets a little personal.  Like, some of the questions started turning into, you know, how we like our sex. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Are you seeing anybody?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  We had girlfriends.  Oh, yeah.  And on three separate occasions, before, during, and after this interview, she asked if we  have any cute friends, because she doesn't have a boyfriend.  Was that before or after she decided to get more comfortable by taking her shoes off?  Her shoes off.  And then she goes, can I take my shoes off?  Oh, he goes, I don't know.  Do your feet smell?  Well, she then picks up one bare foot, puts it right against her nose, and sniffs. 
[00:06:30]  Very, very nice move.  Nice move right there.  Sidebar, when she said, do you have any cute friends, did either one of you creeps think  to mention Jim Norton?  She said, cute.  Oh, look at me being funny.  Look at me.  I'm a pistol.  Pipe down over there.  I'm being funny.  Pipe down.  Pipe down, Norton. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, for the love of Eve.  So, um...  Suck.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So she's asking us these questions about girlfriends and sex, and I don't really know  where they were coming from or going.  No.  She basically asked us how we like our sex.  How we like it.  What our fetishes are.  Right.  I told her my fetish. 
[00:07:30]  I have a new...  I have a new gag, man.  I'm going to play it for all it's worth.  That you have this new fetish?  Just giving all sorts of false information.  Well, we might as well.  I basically told her I was bipolar.  I told her that I was into aculinctus, which is the art of licking a lady's eyeballs because  she likes it and she gets aroused by that.  For pleasure.  That's my fetish I told her.  And then I said my second fetish is axillism, which is the art of having sex with a girl's  armpit.  Right. 
[00:08:00]  Much more effective if the hair is growing in a little bit in the armpit area.  Yeah.  Moist a little hair.  Come on.  Go for it.  Yeah.  But she's asking us about our sex habits.  Yeah.  I...  So I don't know.  We left the interview just going...  Paul turns to me and goes, look, I want to say this right now.  I don't think that was a real interview.  He goes, so if it does turn up that that's true, I just want to be on record that I said  it, that I think that was just a chick that wanted to come in and hang out and just hang 
[00:08:30]  out and see what happened.  Because remember, too, she had like 10 pages of questions she wanted to ask us.  Yeah.  She only got through half of it and we were like, look, man, we got to start the show  in two minutes, so we got to get out of here.  Yeah.  And I go, if you need to, you know, you come back again.  We'll check you out.  Oh, no, I think I got enough.  What's that about?  I don't know.  What happened to all the other questions she needed to ask?  She said she's going to L.A.  Like tomorrow or something. 
[00:09:00]  Next week.  Hey, Ben, why don't we call her up?  Get her on the phone.  Get her on the phone.  We need to talk to this lady.  If we've been had, that's great.  We'll give her the props.  Why doesn't our national phone number ring anymore?  That's a little strange.  Something's up there.  Give the number out.  Because Philly's been calling like crazy every day.  866-277-4.  Wow.  If you want to get a hold of us here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:09:30]  So I don't know.  We'll get her on the phone, maybe.  See what she's all about.  What are you laughing at?  I'm a pistol.  You're a pistol.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  About this, you know, whole playboy thing, maybe possibly being fake.  I had a college roommate who anytime he wanted to do something really cool, you know, meet a celebrity, he would make up a magazine and try to interview him. 
[00:10:00]  And, uh, hello?  You would do that?  No, not me.  My roommate.  Oh, be like fake reporter.  Yeah, like he'd say he's doing it from, like, the Rutgers newspaper or, you know, some other, like, Indian music magazine.  See, most people would check.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  These people would not check.  To make sure they're legit.  See, she got us good, though.  She's hot.  So you're thinking, ah, she's got to be legit.  I don't know, man.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, Jeff.  Bye.  Bye.  Someone is saying, Big Mike. 
[00:10:30]  Yo, this sounds like the handiwork of the infamous Mr. Ron Bennington himself.  Of the Ron and Fez show that is right before us here in New York?  Yes, it is.  Interesting.  I don't know.  Sounds funny.  Oh, my.  No, no, because he would have had her ask some Ron and Fez questions.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah.  I don't know.  All right, guys.  You suck.  Thank you.  Something is definitely up.  And we've got to get to the bottom of it.  And believe me, if she wasn't very attractive, she or he would have been out. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  If it was a guy or if she wasn't attractive, you know, we're not running a little interview school here.  I told her everything.  I told her about the girl that smelled.  Right.  Because she was asking all these, like, very sexual questions.  What's the hetero, as far as heterosexual sex goes,  what's the one thing that's kind of off limits?  So we went to the analingus thing and said, you know, if a chick wants to perform that act on you, 
[00:11:30]  it's kind of like, no, get away from back there because I'm not too sure of the freshness of back there.  What's the matter, Norton?  I can't believe you wouldn't allow that to be done.  No, not to me.  It's phenomenal.  No.  What face is back behind Jim Norton?  And when did this happen?  I dated a girl, a real freak, and she used to like when I would pull her hair and lower the area down so she couldn't move. 
[00:12:00]  Lovely.  Oh, my God.  Lovely.  You have no idea how good that feels.  Pull her hair.  And just lay her on the, like, on her back.  Right.  And then you would put that area there and all of a sudden she's forced into doing it.  Yeah.  That's called assault, sexual assault.  Not if she's willing.  No.  This is what she wanted.  She was like a bud frog.  She really enjoyed it.  Yodeling up the old canal.  That was wonderful.  Oh, my God.  Well. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, but, yeah, wait.  Did you just bathe?  I'm really hygienic.  You know, scrub-a-dub and.  Very hygienic.  But, you know, I don't know.  But if there's any log remnants, hey, you deal with it.  See, that's just it.  When it's, you know, when it's barren of any hair, like on a woman.  And, you know, there's nothing that could really trip you up there.  But with a guy, it's like, you know, you walk through a jungle.  You don't know what the hell's going to jump out at you.  I may have three hairs back there. 
[00:13:00]  Very boyish.  Too much information.  Well, Jim, tell me more.  Right.  Hey, I'm intrigued.  Let's go with it.  Three hairs grasping on one dingleberry.  Three.  Great.  Hey, I'm Ben.  Yes.  A lot of women out there with hairy teeth.  Did you, um...  I left her a message.  Say it in?  Yeah.  Tell me she'll call back.  Maybe she'll call back.  Maybe she'll call back. 
[00:13:30]  I just love to know what's up.  Wasn't she supposed to hang out in the studio at three?  Three o'clock.  Oh, look at that.  I think she kind of got the feeling we were on to her at the end there.  Really?  She bailed quickly.  She really did.  So now I need to know what this was all about.  She said, do I have to see Ben or can I just leave?  Hmm.  Like, do I have to hang out where you can catch me or can I just bolt out this door?  This one was Ben's doing.  And if you got any cute friends, she said, right before she left, too.  Ben's... 
[00:14:00]  And then she's telling us about how she's wowing guys all the time.  Yeah.  She said she had a wow story.  She goes, yeah, I'm driving the other day and I went to wow and I'm beeping the horn.  And I'm holding my shirt open and this jerk didn't see me.  And I'm kind of like, she's a writer, playboy, and she's wowing?  What?  I think someone's pulling a fast one on us.  You think?  Well, you know something?  If so, they better show their face soon.  Bravo.  Could be Jay Moore.  Could be Ron and Fez.  Mm-hmm.  Does she have nice legs?  She was hot, man. 
[00:14:30]  She was hot.  She was tall, thin, and very pretty.  Is she wearing a skirt or shorts?  Skirt.  No.  Yeah, because her calves were showing.  I think she was doing those capri pants.  No, because it was loose around the bottom.  Aren't capris, like, tight?  I think it was like three-quarter pants.  I thought it was a skirt.  It was definitely not a skirt.  We would have saw everything when she smelled her toes.  I thought you...  I didn't see.  I was sitting across.  When she went to smell her toes, I thought you got a view. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, trust me.  I went for it.  That's why I know it was pants.  Well, if you would know better than I what she was wearing.  Yeah, it was...  What am I saying?  It was definitely not a skirt.  I know.  I was in more of a position to try to see inside her shirt, but that wasn't happening either.  Why don't you guys just attack her with a pool kill?  You know, she starts the interview by saying, look, make believe I'm a guy.  You can say whatever the hell you want.  She goes, don't be shy.  Well, Jay's on the line.  We know he's on the line.  Just thank you. 
[00:15:30]  Can't pick him up if he's not on hold.  Jay!  Ladies and gentlemen.  Jay Moore.  What's up, guys?  Hey, you're not playing a gag on us, are you?  What?  You didn't send over a fake Playboy interview, did you?  No.  I'm in town.  I called to tell you I was in town.  Oh.  Fake Playboy interview.  I'd be sending over Coke and Horace for everybody.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, it's not funny to me.  Fake interview.  No, we just had a, we interviewed with a Playboy, we think, and it was a girl, and she really  didn't have experience as an interviewer. 
[00:16:00]  Well, this was her first interview.  It was her first interview, and we're not sure if she was an interviewer or just some  chick that wanted to hang out.  Don't you guys have a publicist to call to, like, uh...  Oh, who are we?  Jay Moore?  A publicist?  Get out of here.  Uh.  We don't have any of that.  You're going to need one, pal, so dummies from Playboy don't get through.  So, yeah, she never did this before.  She's a freelance writer.  We should ask what other stuff she's written.  And she smelled her own feet.  That's the sign of a professional interview.  She smelled her own feet right in front of us. 
[00:16:30]  Who's that, Newton?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't see Larry King doing that.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm going to take my shoes off.  I'm going to smell my feet.  Right.  And then she went to stick her foot in Opie's face.  Right.  Ooh.  The other foot.  Ooh.  Oak goes, does the other one stink?  And she goes, I don't know.  She took her shoe off and shoved it in Opie's face.  Nice.  That's a professional interview.  Now I need to know if this is going to really bother me.  Nice.  Jay, we're doing nothing.  Come on by.  I mean, we're doing a lot.  I mean, the listeners should know we're doing something.  Yeah, get up here, man. 
[00:17:00]  All right, bro.  I just woke up.  All right, whatever.  Yeah, look at the life Jay Moore's living through.  Hey, man, I took the red eye in.  I had to come home, throw a little to the wife.  Haven't seen her in a while.  No, you don't see your old lady in like a month.  You got to really like lay out the wood when you see him.  Did you pound her?  Oh, it's like other level.  It's absolutely like Bob Barker's going to give her a fur coat on the way out.  Did you like it?  It's other level because, you know, they're walking around the streets of Manhattan.  You never know.  They might slip and just forget a little bit.  Right. 
[00:17:30]  That you're that guy.  Yeah, you got to.  You got to give him a good one.  Good to see you again.  Let's kiss a little.  I'm the mouth even, sure.  And the next thing you know, you're making a canoe.  There you go.  You're bending surfboards in your basement.  You spend a lot of time down there?  Down there?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm very courteous.  I'm so courteous that I'll say, watch your fingers.  I'm hanging up.  There he goes, Jay Moore.  He'll be in.  All right.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  We should break.  Yeah, see if we can't get her somewhere on our phone.  Our phone number, 866-2774.  Wow.  I'm looking for toilet training books.  Uh, everybody poops is still the standard, of course.  Uh, we've also got the less popular nobody poops but you.  So what can't we?  So, uh...  Oh, then you want your anomaly child and that concentrated evil coming out the back of you.  The O.V. Anthony Show.  I need to go poopies! 
[00:18:30]  Anthony Sam Adams.  Mm.  Oh, oh.  Listen to that.  That sound great.  Very important that we play the sound effect during the Sam Adams read, Anthony.  Doesn't it want...  See?  It makes you want to pop a sound.  Oh, listen to that.  Gleaming, nice, cool beer.  Sam Adams.  One more time.  I've got to hear. 
[00:19:00]  How do we know that it's not a can of, like, four day?  No.  Oh, I heard...  Okay, it's a bottle.  Wow.  That microphone was in the glass.  Get so drunk, you sniff your own feet like a dog and interview your heroes.  Nice.  Sam Adams.  I love it.  Drink it all the time.  Oh, great.  Every time you play that effect, you screw the counter.  Now I don't know how much time is left in the spot.  It was so...  We're so effed. 
[00:19:30]  Was this just for New York?  Yes.  Oh, man.  I'll just say Sam Adams.  I love it.  And you will, too.  Go get one right now.  Sam Adams.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  866-277-4WOW to get a hold of the show.  Cowbell Bill sitting in.  We've got Jim Norton.  Hey, hey.  Jay Moore on his way.  Hey, hey. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, hey.  And we're trying to figure out if that interview with Playboy today was legit.  I think it was not.  That's what I think.  You would think that if she just did an interview with us, right?  She would tune in to kind of get a gist of what we're talking about.  Maybe, you know, use some of the stuff we said in the interview with some of the stuff we're talking about on the show.  Right?  Wouldn't you do that?  And then she would have heard us saying this and say, no, I am with Playboy, and then called up. 
[00:20:30]  But no.  So now we've got to figure out who got us with a pretty good prank.  I'm saying it's a prank.  You're saying it's a prank.  I'm going on record to say it's a prank now.  But who?  Also, our manboob contest continues today.  We saw some horrific sights yesterday, Anthony.  Oh, many horrific sights.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Radio who? 
[00:21:00]  His pictures are up on all the websites.  Yeah, if you've got the manboobs and you want them taken care of, we're having a contest.  You come down.  You don't need your face in the picture.  You get some shots done.  We'll put the pictures up on the website, and then the listeners will decide who needs the procedure the most.  What?  What?  What?  Wait a minute.  Why would you call that number?  What happened?  Denise from the Playboy Inn?  That's the wrong name.  Says it's her.  No, dude.  Let's see what this is all about. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Anyway, if you want in on the manboob contest, it's come down any day this week between 3 and 7, okay?  Right.  And we've got to thank Dr. Gregory Pistone, www.drpistone.com, for helping us out with this contest.  He's going to do the procedure.  He's out of Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Does this all the time.  Also sponsoring this is goldenpalace.com, and if you go to that website, you can enter to win a trip to Hedonism 3.  What?  Hello? 
[00:22:00]  Denise?  Cindy.  Cindy.  Hello?  Hi.  Hey.  Where are you?  I'm on my way home.  I told you I lived in Connecticut.  That's right.  She lives in Connecticut.  All right.  This is the girl.  You got it.  Have you been listening to the show?  Yeah, my phone's a piece, and I haven't been able to come in.  Oh, okay.  Hey.  Hey, first of all, thanks for the compliments.  Well, yeah, you're real hot.  And secondly, what could possibly have not come across as totally genuine? 
[00:22:30]  No, no, we weren't sure if you're with Playboy, or if you're a writer, or...  You said you've never interviewed before, and that kind of put up a red flag for us.  Well, you would think that the...  And if you weren't hot, we would have probably asked a follow-up, like, well, what kind of  freelance stuff have you done?  Well, I would think that the dynamic duo of Maverick Radio might be sort of in tune  to Maverick Journalism.  All right.  Well, look at that.  Fair enough.  And I'm not going to argue, because she's hot.  Look at that.  Are you still looking for a cute friend? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  You know, if I knew Jim Brewer was going to be down there, I would have hung on the wall.  I really want to throw myself out the window.  I'm Jim Norton.  I'm like Brewer, but not as funny and not as rich.  Just picture Jim Brewer if he had AIDS.  I don't need rich.  I just need good looking.  Oh, that's awful.  I'm like Brewer with AIDS and less film credits.  So you are a legitimate journalist.  Absolutely.  And you do have some relationship with Playboy magazine. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  You want to give them a call?  We did.  No one will call us back.  You got to call Chris Napopla.  Number out?  Oh, pipe down out there.  Yeah, don't give that number out.  I just dumped out of that.  We'll have every kook calling.  No, that's the general number.  You have to ask for them.  All right.  Well, what other articles have you written?  Well, I was a movie reviewer for Film Journal Magazine.  Oh, yeah?  What did you review, and what was it?  It was...  Remember that George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer movie?  It was like... 
[00:24:00]  I quit like five years ago.  And what did you think of that?  Oh, that's good.  I don't really care.  Yeah, we don't care.  What else?  So, you did something about five years ago?  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  We'll just have to wait and see.  I'm telling you.  What was your impression of Opie and Anthony?  What?  What was your impression of Opie and Anthony?  Did you like us?  You would think a reporter from Playboy would have a better...  Hold on.  Hold on.  You said the S word.  Yeah, don't say the S word.  Remember, we talked about that in the interview. 
[00:24:30]  We can't curse on the radio still.  Okay, ask.  Let me call you back in five.  I'm on the phone.  All right.  All right.  There she goes.  Well, oh, she did call back.  What do you think?  I think Jim Crow is going to be there.  Oh, Norton's all disappointed.  Knife right in my man boob.  Don't worry.  You get your pick of the girls that don't blink, so...  Hey, I got my letter from the IRS today, Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  Your letter from the IRS.  Oh, your tax little relief thing?  Yeah.  Billions of dollars in tax relief to the country from George Bush and company.  Know how stupid our government is?  They're always talking about how they're over budget and this and that, and they spend too  much money, and there's too many useless jobs out there for government and employees. 
[00:25:30]  They are pretty much sending these letters out to just about every working citizen in America,  right?  Wasting lots and lots of money on postage to tell you that you're going to soon get a check  from the government.  Well, it's not...  Why don't they just send the check from the government?  Postage would be like if they sent it to some other company, but they're the post office,  so it's kind of a freebie.  No, but the paper...  No, it's not really a freebie.  They still have to get people to work and get the stuff out and all that.  I understand what you're saying, but it is still time. 
[00:26:00]  Right.  It's someone's time that we're paying, right?  Paper.  Paper, all that crap.  Dear taxpayer, we are pleased to inform you that the United States Congress passed and  President George W. Bush signed into law the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation  Act of 2001, which provides long-term tax relief for all Americans...  Thank God.  ...who pay income taxes.  Sounds good so far, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Billions of dollars, I hear.  The new tax law provides immediate tax relief in 2001 and long-term tax relief for the years  to come. 
[00:26:30]  As part of the immediate tax relief, you will be receiving a check in the amount of...  Come on, give it to me.  $300.  $300.  $300.  During the week of August 27, 2001.  How...  $300, why bother?  How much do you put in?  The amount of money we put in, that should say, we're proud to tell you that you're getting  $30,000 back.  Yeah, now that would be nice.  Go buy a summer home somewhere in the mountains. 
[00:27:00]  Most people are not in that tax bracket, though.  Most people are broken.  $300 is almost a week's pay.  You're insane.  It's still ridiculous.  Now, you know something?  Because when this hit the papers and the media and stuff, you know, they were talking, like  Andrew said, you know, billions of dollars.  Yeah, yeah.  But like we've said on this program many times, you do the math and you realize it means nothing.  You're really kind of getting, well, it's like somebody robbing you.  And then they give you back, like, two bucks and go, see, I'm a nice guy.  Yeah.  I'm a nice guy. 
[00:27:30]  It's like they rob you and they leave your license in the wallet.  Yeah.  You know, like, just a little thing.  Here, look, we didn't take it all.  Well, they're savages, so they shoot you and take your Navigator and send back the floor mats.  Why won't cabs pick us up?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  You know, that is a sick story.  And until, I don't know, until that just stops happening, there's always going to be a problem. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Always.  Talking about the story, I'm here in New York.  Guy was driving home in his Navigator.  Guy, where was he from, India?  East Indian immigrant.  Yeah, immigrant.  Young guy.  Guy stops at a gas station and there's a bunch of people waiting outside of a car that was broken down.  Two couples.  Two couples?  And a four-year-old child.  Five people, two men, two women, and a four-year-old child.  All black.  Coincidentally.  And the guy figures he's going to be a nice guy and give him a ride. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Where does it get him?  Bedford-Stuyvesant is where they want to go, which is normally a fine area to drive through at night.  Oh, Jesus.  And surprisingly, the occupants begin hitting this nice man and they want to take his truck  and sell it, which is normally not the way things are done.  And they shoot him in the head and take his truck.  Right.  And try to sell it the next day because that's brilliant criminal work.  What I read yesterday about this story, they beat the guy.  Yeah.  And then they drag him out of the truck and two of the guys, they both have guns, one 
[00:29:00]  of them turns and goes, yo, pop this nigga.  He saw who we are.  It's like, oh, how?  What?  What the hell are you thinking?  First of all, the guy.  Good Samaritan.  You know the only time you see Good Samaritan, because he said Good Samaritan.  Yes.  The only time you see Good Samaritan.  You don't see Good Samaritan helps out and everything fine.  You only see Good Samaritan when Good Samaritan ends up dead.  Dead. 
[00:29:30]  You got to be a lunatic to try to help people.  And this does not bode well with the African-American community because, you know, it's just another  thing that people are going to say, oh, look, see, like I'm going to stop and help black  guys.  Well, it was actually the four of them were angry because they thought he was Tim Burton  and they were mad that they didn't get cast in the film.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  Norton.  Oh, my.  Wow. 
[00:30:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, that's bad.  You know something?  It doesn't help the stereotypes.  It doesn't help the cause.  It doesn't help for the people.  I mean, there are some black people out there that are really angry with white people thinking  that that's what's keeping them down.  You know, is the white man keeping them down.  It really isn't.  It's it's people, other black people that act like a frigging animals and put no value 
[00:30:30]  on life whatsoever and shoot a guy that was doing you a favor and take it for his truck.  When he was saying, just take the truck, take it, you know, you get away with your life.  You feel you feel like you got away with something.  But no, that wasn't good enough.  They had to shoot him in the head because that nigger saw something.  That's what they said.  Pop that nigger.  He saw us.  If the Indian guy would have been honest, he could have just said, look, you all look  like, I can't identify.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus Christ. 
[00:31:00]  Well, I'm going to try to move along here.  Joe, what's up?  Just trying to help him.  Is that a vacuum cleaner?  Hey, Joe.  Joe, where the hell are you?  Joe.  Now I know what I want to know what he's doing.  Joe.  Whatever.  It sounded like a video game.  He's saying that the 300 bucks might not be a lot, you know, people, but it's a lot of 
[00:31:30]  money for the government to be given back.  Sounded like he was working in a factory.  I would rather, you know, going back to the, you know, the refund thing, I would rather  we all take our 300 bucks we're going to get, tell the government to keep it, and get  rid of our tolls or something.  Oh, stop.  That'll never happen.  Those things are just, we throw money into baskets for people.  Think about it.  You're driving through.  You're throwing money into baskets.  Whee!  No one ever asks.  No one questions it.  No one questions it.  No, we just drive around. 
[00:32:00]  Whee!  Oh, now they make it easier.  You put the little plastic thing on your windshield and you drive through.  No, it's like it's free.  And then you get the bill.  Whee!  We'll take it right off your credit card.  Hey, I'm just driving here.  You throw money.  Can you imagine some guy just standing there with a basket?  Hey!  Where's my take?  And you're just, okay, I'll throw money in.  I'll throw some money in.  Screw it.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, the reason they're giving such a small amount of money, they're making it look like, 
[00:32:30]  you know, they're helping you out and stuff, but they really want you to just, you  know, go right out and spend it.  So, uh, get the economy going and stuff.  Yeah, but they say that might not even, you know.  Oh, it's probably not going to do anything, but, you know, it makes Bush look good, and  you never know, it might do something.  So go out and buy a PlayStation or something.  It's just silly.  It really is.  Why don't they, they should have just gave us some blockbuster coupons.  Yeah, right.  Maybe a free Slurpee or something.  Something I could work with.  Right.  300 bucks.  And you know they're going to figure out a way to tax that. 
[00:33:00]  Of course.  When you spend it.  Well, yeah, there you go.  Dude, when you spend it, it is going to be taxed.  There you go.  So you get some of that back.  Right.  That's ridiculous.  I never understood that one.  You get taxed.  They tax your paycheck.  And then no matter what you buy with your, the rest of what they feel they should give  you, it's taxed.  It's taxed.  Hey, wait a minute.  Didn't you tax that already?  Isn't this why we left another country?  Yeah.  Isn't that what happened?  And believe me, I've said this before. 
[00:33:30]  If they didn't take it out of your check every week, and at the end of the year, you got  a bill from the United States government for thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars,  there would be a revolution in this country.  What about the people that, you know, you're not that responsible, and you make your money,  you put it in the bank, or you spend it, and now the government bills you, and you can't  pay it.  There'd be people in jail.  It wouldn't work.  But since they just take out, you know, a certain amount every week, it's not that bad. 
[00:34:00]  You kind of got used to it.  But it's an awful thing.  You're a 50-50 or a 40-60 partner with the United States government.  You'd be in debtor's prison.  Debtor's prison.  Yes.  Like medieval times?  You didn't pay a debt.  You went to debtor's prison.  You are in debtor's prison.  Debtors.  Kurt.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  I was watching C-SPAN the other day, and there was a...  I actually watched it.  There was a big debate over whether or not they should send out the letters, and Chuck 
[00:34:30]  Schumer was really opposed to it, because he thought that it was blatant propaganda to  just help the president look good.  It really is, because they...  Do you really need a letter telling you that you're going to get a check?  And it's it.  The letter's got, like, George...  George Bush is giving you this.  What a guy.  And they said it cost you roughly $30 million to send it out to him.  $30 million to send out all the refund notifications, which comes out of federal money, right? 
[00:35:00]  Which they get from taxing you.  You know what you could do with $30 million for society in general or your local community?  Well, you get this show for three years, according to John Minnelli from The Post.  Yeah.  Thanks, John.  All right.  That's all I have to say.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, Kurt.  You guys talk.  Okay.  Bye.  Well, we should take a break, huh?  Cindy's back from Playboy.  All right, we'll talk to her next.  Nice.  Yeah, we can talk about the amputee twister game we want to get going. 
[00:35:30]  Part of the cripple bouts.  Amputee twister.  Now, that's going to be fun.  Let me just ask Jimmy.  He's the one-legged boxing champion.  Jimmy.  Hey, what's up, brother?  What's up?  How you been doing?  All right.  Just remember, I fly like a rock and I sting like a stump.  But, you know, this thing you're talking about, the taxes?  Yeah.  Okay?  I'm getting $600 back, but you want to know why I'm getting that back?  Because I did my own taxes.  I didn't go to, like, H&R Block or anybody like that where I have to pay them. 
[00:36:00]  I'm getting this money back because I did my own taxes, and I checked off every damn  thing that they gave me.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Sounds like you did a little shuffling with the numbers.  No, I didn't do no shuffle.  Good for you.  And I did not do no shuffle.  Good for you.  Good for you, then.  Good for you.  Now, one other thing I wanted to say was, when are you going to do the wheelchair jousting?  Well, it sounds like a couple did it in the paper today.  Yeah.  We did. 
[00:36:30]  Another story to talk about.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you talking about?  We've got lots to do, but we've got to take a break.  We'll tell you about a very interesting murder.  A couple of very interesting murders.  A murder?  No, this is supposed to be Olympics, not murder.  Jimmy, are you on dope today?  No, I am not.  I'm just really happy.  He's on the dope.  Yeah.  I just want to ask you.  You have one leg.  Yeah.  Would you participate in the amputee twister game?  Amputee?  Yeah, I'd love to.  Okay.  Hold on a line.  We need some people with no arms, though.  Or, well, one arm. 
[00:37:00]  One arm?  No, even two.  This would be great.  No, but then how do you do right-hand green?  How are you going to do right-hand green if you don't have a right hand?  That's the beauty of it.  You're right.  And you oil it up a little bit, and you do it in the center lane of the Bell Parkway.  This is going to be a whacked-out show today.  All right.  Let's go to the FU line, and we'll continue.  Oh, when we get back, I saw the Titanic ride for kids.  Thank God.  We've discussed this on the show, and I saw it in action, and it is twisted. 
[00:37:30]  That's some observations.  Yes.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  I'd like to give a big FU to my boat mechanic, Nicky.

Next message.  Yeah, this is Hardcore Dave from Jersey, and I'd like to give a big FU to my girlfriend,  Junk Rocking Father.  That is the other side of the world, making a change.

This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  It's the O&A Show.  Once again, I want to thank Weezer for stopping by the show today.  That was very cool. 
[00:40:00]  Fans finally coming aboard the O&A Show, and we greatly appreciate it, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  877-692-1027 if you want in today.  We were talking about the tax thing that Bush is doing for all of us.  Yeah.  And David writes, Opie, the refund is diluted, but if the country spends it, it will boost  the economy.  Bush doesn't care about the taxpayers.  He's just using you and me to save his name in the faltering economy. 
[00:40:30]  If that money went to deficit, it would be sucked out of the economy.  But if Americans are spending it, the economy is helped.  Oh, yeah?  I don't think it's going to work.  The economy goes up and down, and now Bush is in the middle of a bad one.  Boy, that Clinton, he's amazing.  Eight years of prosperity, he fell right into it.  He's getting his Frankie done in the Oval Office.  No one cared because the stocks were booming. 
[00:41:00]  And then he leaves.  Stupid George W. comes in, and the economy's taking a crap.  Like father, like son.  Yeah.  Same thing happened to his papa when he was trying to get reelected.  Remember after the Gulf War?  I was saying, George Bush, senior there, after the Gulf War, could have trotted around in a  tutu, skipping down Pennsylvania Avenue.  He still would have been reelected.  And then the economy turns, oh, the people get pissed.  I have a question about the economy.  I'm not, this I'm not sure about. 
[00:41:30]  I'm wondering if anybody will be spending their $300 refund this weekend at the Stress Factory.  Oh.  Shameless.  Because I'll be performing there Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Oh, there's extra money now in people's pockets, or at least a note that says you're going to get it.  I love when you look uncomfortable when you have to do your own plug.  Oh, it's disgraceful.  You start turning red.  I have to give the number for Thursday and Friday.  It's 732-545-4242, which is ha-ha.  That's what 4242 is, and Vinny, the owner, should be gutted with a fishing knife for thinking 
[00:42:00]  that was clever.  You stink.  545-ha-ha-ha.  Oh, again, it's a comedy.  Ha-ha.  Ugh.  Ha-ha.  Because you might have a laugh at the club, so why not laugh while you're dialing?  Piece of filth.  Oh, man.  Hey, Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey.  Yeah, listen, Opie, I just got to, you know, I just got to make a point to you.  You know, what Norton said while you were talking before about, you know, you may think that's a scrawny refund, you know, 
[00:42:30]  but my mom makes about $300 per week, and of that, we only have about $100 of it to spend to eat and maintain the house and feel the cars.  And what you may see as scrawny for, you know, $300, my mom's probably only going to get a refund of something around the area of $50.  Matt, a little advice for you?  Yeah.  Maybe your mom should find another corner. 
[00:43:00]  No, listen, dude, don't even start pulling that.  Don't even start pulling that, because that's not funny.  No, a corner with more traffic.  That's not funny, okay?  Because my mom works very hard as a secretary, and she works for a large company, and it doesn't seem to make a difference.  The harder she works, she can't move up, and there are some people that are stuck in that situation.  She was a hoo-er.  Fortunately, you guys got out of that situation.  Hey, who's the stripper?  She was a hoo-er.  No, that's my sister. 
[00:43:30]  Where'd you old strippers go to die?  Definitely not to heaven.  All right, tell your mom, $150 to Hardway, huh?  No, but...  Dude, $100?  What, is she a maid in $17.50?  $100 a week?  No, she makes $300 a week, but of that, we only, after the bills and everything, and rent and everything...  Matt, Matt, no way that your mom makes $300 as a secretary.  Yeah.  She must be an old green secretary.  And that's before taxes. 
[00:44:00]  That's before taxes.  Yeah, but you figure $100, two people, $12...  No, there's three people.  No, no, I'm saying...  Oh, three people, that's $36 in tickets, because it's $12 on Thursday at the Stress Factory.  Hey, Matt...  You guys are right, and I appreciate it.  Matt, where's your dad?  Tell your mom to pee in your home.  My dad, my mom and my dad are divorced.  My dad is a long-haul truck driver, and I really don't ever talk to him.  Doesn't he fork over any cash?  Yeah, there's child support, but that gets mixed in with the money for the bills. 
[00:44:30]  I mean, literally, we're a lower-middle-class family.  My mom just declared bankruptcy because she's still trying to pay off the mortgage on a  house that we lost, because my father...  It's funny, because I don't know you.  Oh, uh...  I know you're just teasing me, but, you know, all I'm saying is, oh, keep that in mind.  There are just some people that don't have it as lucky as you. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, wait, somebody wants to give your mom a little message.  How would you like to move my luck?  Huh?  Hey, Matt, you have no clue.  You don't want my luck, okay?  Don't you know what...  Wait a minute.  I've got to straighten something out here first, though.  The whole thing with the $300 bucks isn't that some people...  Yeah, some people do make $300 bucks, man.  I think...  When I was working for a living, I made $350 a week.  And it sucks.  But the thing is, the tax break is not really that much of a break. 
[00:45:30]  Exactly.  But what you pay in...  You know, them throwing you $300 bucks back really is ridiculous, no matter what you make.  Matt, and get off your lazy ass and get a job and help your mom out.  What the F are you doing?  I do.  What do you do?  I'm a photographer.  How do you make money being a photographer?  You don't.  Yeah.  Unless you're like a...  Look at you being selfish.  You don't make enough.  Don't worry, Mom.  My photo shoot is going to be happening soon while you guys are starving.  Go out and get a job.  I have one.  Ansel Adams.  And fortunately, you know what?  It's impossible.  It's impossible for somebody who works independently. 
[00:46:00]  Your mom is turning tricks on the corner because you want to be Ansel Adams.  How old are you, son?  I'm 16.  When I was your...  That would be...  Have a good one, guys.  All right, man.  All right.  All right.  Of course.  You can get the point of the whole thing.  All right, we're back with Cindy, the Playboy interviewer.  Allegedly.  Cindy!  Yes.  Hey, you're back.  So, well, we probably have...  Okay, this is a good way to...  What issue of Playboy is this going to be in? 
[00:46:30]  Well, you know, the turnaround's a few months.  So you're not quite sure on what...  Well, we have a whole brand new audience checking in, Ansel.  You want to, like, quickly set this up?  We did an interview with Cindy earlier today before the show, and we are not quite sure  if she actually has any affiliation with Playboy magazine.  So she interviewed us, and we think maybe we were had.  Because?  Um, I don't know.  It was more Opie saying it, but I kind of agreed with him a little bit. 
[00:47:00]  But I'm willing to hold back any opinions I have.  Well, you know, I think, um, I think all this doubt, you know, should lead to some sort of  bet.  Oh, yeah?  Cindy, I'll tell you this much.  You did a good job interviewing us.  Yeah.  There were some questions that we never got before.  Well, hey, you know, you come in there, you want to be a little different, shake it up a  little bit, and everyone's looking at their watch.  That was something, too.  It was all the sex things that we figured maybe, you know, you were just curious about  one of ours or both of our sexploits, you know what I mean? 
[00:47:30]  Did you like my fetish?  Um, yeah, I don't think that's going to make them some magazine.  Why?  Maybe in a facetious way.  What?  Maybe in a facetious way.  Sarcastic.  Facetious.  You guys have kind of boring sex lives, though, I've got to tell you.  Really?  Well, we didn't really get into any details.  Yeah, why are we going to tell you?  Yeah.  Why not?  What do you want?  Like, details?  Of sex?  Like, what?  Well, you give us some.  Just because Ann said he doesn't... 
[00:48:00]  What, the rusty trombone done to him?  That's boring?  Yeah, I don't like the idea of a chick putting her face back there and, uh...  Hey, you know, I just...  What's wrong with the feet?  I thought the feet were kind of cute.  It is, but it's just kind of, I guess, hard for the boys to be serious with an interview  when the interviewer is sniffing her feet like a retarded four-year-old.  Um, I don't think they said that, actually.  That was you.  You're probably right, and I have an erection.  I apologize.  That was...  I'm jealous I wasn't there. 
[00:48:30]  Cindy?  Yeah?  We said it was hot.  Okay.  When you did that, because that's something, uh...  You know, the guy from Time Magazine didn't pull his shoes up and saw that smell on his feet.  If he did, we would have punched him in the face.  But, you know, when you did it, it was pretty hot.  Okay, see?  Yeah.  There you go.  How'd they smell?  But you don't want to...  Yeah, Opie, how'd they smell?  Um, yeah, you didn't have much smell on your toes.  That was nice.  Yeah.  Very nice.  But, I don't know, you threw us off by saying you've never done this before. 
[00:49:00]  You're just pulling out your little recorder.  Yeah, well...  You think Playboy, you know, you've done it a few times.  That's all.  There's a lot of people, uh, you know, trying to be journalists out there.  They probably are pissed to hear that you've never done an interview before and you're working for Playboy.  Well, you know, um, you gotta start somewhere, so why not start big, right?  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  All right, well, we'll be looking forward to it in some issue.  Some future issue of Playboy.  Is Playboy gonna send over a photographer?  Uh, maybe. 
[00:49:30]  Is there gonna be some guy with a disposable camera?  I think, um, I think that if this...  Hold on, wait, what's the maybe?  That's, that's protocol, man.  They send a photographer after the interview.  Oh, Cindy, you're like, I, I have, I haven't figured it out.  Oh, actually, they told me to...  You're a freelance writer and you're pitching this story to Playboy, so they say, well, you  know, send it in and we'll, we'll see what happens.  So, you're gonna send your stuff in and you're hoping they're gonna write an article on  You know, after all this grief, um, when this article actually appears, what do I get? 
[00:50:00]  What do I get for having to endure this?  You get to come in and take all your clothes off.  Great.  Isn't that good?  You can sniff our feet.  You wanna call them?  Huh?  You wanna call them?  Well, you wanna come down and check out the actual show today?  Well, I'm already home now.  Well, you got Jay Moore coming in, we got Kimmy from Survivor, we got, uh, Garrett Morris.  Yeah, okay.  All right, get back in your car.  Um, am I gonna hit traffic?  So, I don't know. 
[00:50:30]  You're in the lobby, aren't you?  No.  Yeah, I'll come back down.  Can I have a beer when I get there?  Uh-huh.  You got it.  We'll get you all liquored up.  Okay.  The reporters usually don't drink beer with us.  See, that's the thing you forgot to mention.  When I first walked in, the first thing I asked from Ben was for a beer.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Ben didn't, if Ben would have said that, we would have definitely thought you were faking.  He definitely didn't bring that up.  Hmm.  You like Jaeger?  Sure.  All right, we'll chill the Jaeger up for you, too.  We'll get you snoted.  Do you want to play, uh, What's In My Pants? 
[00:51:00]  You know, I'll think about it on the way down.  Oh, no.  You got to do it over the phone.  You got to do it over the phone.  You know how it works.  I don't know how professional that would be.  Are you home alone?  Hey, I gotta go.  Hey, I won't be ignored.  Do you guys have any cute friends?  Yeah, Jim.  Uh, we got a whole studio full.  Sitting right here.  Okay.  Depending how drunk you get with us, yes.  All right.  What do you consider cute?  I mean, do you need, like, a good build or a nice face? 
[00:51:30]  Okay, enough abuse.  I can't take it anymore.  All right, Cindy.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There she goes.  Not making Playboy.  The fake Playboy reporter.  She'll be faxing it into stepping out after they tell him no.  Guys, I got good news and bad news.  They picked up our article, but it's not Playboy.  It's Biggums.  The same store, sell it. 
[00:52:00]  Swank.  She'll be on the same newsstands as that fine publication, Playboy.  Yeah, it's great, but you guys are before the beaver hunt section, so I think you'll do well.  Over 50 wants to pick it up.  We're pathetic.  Big Butt Magazine will pick it up.  We know that.  All right, so the Titanic ride, Anthony?  Yeah, now you finally saw this.  We had talked about this beforehand, and I can't believe this is not an outcry. 
[00:52:30]  We saw the website and everything, and I think there was a little article in the paper.  I have to tell you, when we were discussing this about a month ago, or even longer,  I thought it was kind of a goof.  No.  No, it's at carnivals and fairs.  I'm driving home.  I'm outside Huntington, and somebody was throwing a kid's party.  And they had the Titanic slide set up, and kids were sliding down it.  It's this big inflatable slide, and it's shaped like the Titanic, but it's only a half of it, 
[00:53:00]  because it's tipped up the stern way up in the air, way up in the air,  and it looks like it's sinking into the ground.  That's right, Anthony.  And the kids climb up a little ladder, and you're able to slide down the decks of the Titanic,  just like the horrified, real-life human beings sliding to their death in the icy waters of the North Atlantic, 
[00:53:30]  bouncing off of the stacks, and when they get down, they go, I want to go again.  Right.  And they climb back up and slide down.  I saw a couple kids bouncing off the smokestacks.  Bouncing off the smokestacks.  This is something that really happened.  Yeah, it was a long time ago, but thousands of people died in a horrible, horrible way.  And now it has just come down to, if enough time goes by, not only can you joke about it, 
[00:54:00]  not only can you talk about it without having to be all somber,  but you can now make a carnival ride out of it.  Right.  Look as the little children climb up to the slanted deck of the Titanic  and slide down with smiles on their face,  not unlike the real passengers with big smiles on their...  Oh, wait, no, those were screams of horror.  But instead of getting done with the slide and going and maybe getting some ice cream, 
[00:54:30]  they will just freeze in the icy cold waters.  Of the North Atlantic.  This song I dedicate to the survivors of the Titanic  and to all the little children,  like the one I was finally able to get with my impotent husband, Rene.  We froze some sperm.  So when they had to cut off his cancerous testicles and prostate,  I was still able to impregnate myself. 
[00:55:00]  The doctors put...  I was still able to impregnate myself with Rene's frozen sperm.  The frozen sperm bouncing into my egg,  much like the Titanic bounced into that iceberg on that dark night  in April of whatever effing year that was.  And the people sinking slowly into the icy waters, 
[00:55:30]  much like Rene's frozen sperm slammed into my ice-cold eggs.  The doctor who did the artificial insemination needed an extra-long turkey baster  to get past my huge camel toe that you see live in concert when I wear my jumpsuits.  Doesn't my camel toe look like the bow of the Titanic slammed into my icy vat? 
[00:56:00]  I think so.  But it all comes down when you add some years,  it can be made into a carnival ride.  This goes to the many women that lost their lives on the Titanic,  and mostly it is dedicated to the survivors.  I am Sam Feer, Master of the Pan Flute. 
[00:56:30]  Try the TWA Flight 800 Flume Plunge,  where we light the children on fire and send them plunging to their beds.  Also, the Hiroshima Fun House.  Is that really my shadow or that of a Jap burnt on a building?  What is it? I don't know. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  But disasters can be fun, just like the Titanic.  Make sure you join us for Columbine Paintball.  It's great.  You run into a high school that looks just like Columbine.  Two people with trench coats chase you with paintball guns.  It's so much fun.  Hey, I'm good. 
[00:57:30]  Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Laugh along, both Gentile and Jew,  as you go through Hitler's Haunted Bunker.  Why? Enough time passed for the Titanic.  Where's the line?  See, I'm making a point here.  There are plenty of disasters.  Let's all ride.  Raid makes a great point on line eight. 
[00:58:00]  Raid, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Your kid slid down the Titanic slide.  Yeah, last year at the Sussex County Fair,  my son went down that.  And the funny thing is,  before he gets on,  they're like,  hey, you can't come on here with your sneakers on.  You've got to take your shoes off.  I'm like,  this isn't bad enough taste as it is,  but the kid's got to take his shoes off  to pretend he's dying on the Titanic.  That's great.  Do they have old people to trample over  and push out of the way  like they did with the lifeboats? 
[00:58:30]  They should have, like,  higher old people on the deck of the Titanic  to push out of the way.  Squirt them with a hose  till the old bastards drown  in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  I wonder if they hose down the kids  with really, really cold water  before they slide down.  Hose them down.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  That's great. 
[00:59:00]  That's great.  We also have little games  for them to play at the carnival.  We have Jean Benet Ramsey whack-a-mole  where you beat her over the head  with a replica of her father's junk.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  And enjoy the food.  It's the Donner Party Buffet.  $4.99 a person.  What about the Shondra Levy hide-and-seek game? 
[00:59:30]  Now, that is truly in bad faith.  Oh, yeah.  Not enough time has passed by.  See, I'm not learning.  The fun part, she never gets to yell,  Olly, olly, oxen free.  Because she's dead.  Larry.  Yeah, yeah.  I came by a farm and picnic the other day  coming back from the store,  and I saw this thing,  and I saw this ship,  and I said,  What is that thing?  And my wife says,  I don't know.  It looks like a ship. 
[01:00:00]  And I thought it was cats deflated.  And when I drove by it,  I said,  Oh, that's a Titanic.  It's a Titanic ride!  For the love of God!  And if the kids are too young  to play on the Titanic ride,  remember,  you can go in the  William Shatner kiddie pool.  Bill Shatner will stand as lifeguard  and do nothing as you drown.  Oh, my God.  Allegedly.  Look at that poor little bastard 
[01:00:30]  struggling for his life.  I'll just stand there  and call the cops in about 0 and 0.  Anthony, what's going on?  Anthony.  Oh, this guy's got a great line.  Anthony.  Yes.  Go.  I want to know  if they close the gates  to all the poor kids  and let the rich kids go first.  They lock him up in the bilge.  You look in the lower portion  of the Titanic ride.  There's poor people down there  covered in coal dust.  Sean, what's going on? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Listen, you forgot about  the Susan Smith car flume  which goes into the water  with the kids in it.  Hey, why not?  Now people are going to be like,  now that's outrageous.  But how much time has to pass  before it's in good taste?  Well, it actually reminds me  of another game  that I thought was really fun.  It's the Oklahoma City bombing game.  And if you win the game,  you're carried away  by a crying fireman.  It's awful.  But I mean,  why is the Titanic any different? 
[01:01:30]  Why the hell  can they make a ride out of it  just because enough time went by  that you make a ride?  Could you imagine  a Flight 800 flume?  Come on.  Today's lunch special,  Sharon Tater tots.  Yes, the Manson experience.  Where the little kids  get the clown  like Charles Manson  to paint their faces up  with little swastikas  on their head.  Bob writes, 
[01:02:00]  I can't wait for the  Puerto Rican Day parade  lawn sprinkler game.  Those aren't water weenies.  Let's go to Greg.  Greg, you're next  on the O.P. and Anthony show.  O.N.A., what's up?  Hey, man.  Congratulations on syndication.  Oh, yeah, that's happening.  Thanks.  Yeah, don't forget  the Paula Poundstone slumber party.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  See, well, that's too new.  That's horrible  that you said that.  Much too new.  There's also the new 
[01:02:30]  Navigator game  where they cover you  in banana juice  and allow four baboons  to attack you  in an navigator.  Oh, wow.  That happened yesterday.  That's awful.  Well, you've got to  get copyright on it  quick before you jump on it.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh.  Well, you get the point.  Phew.  And, of course,  yes, the Ted Kennedy  log flume.  You go with your girl,  but only you come out.  And you can win  a JFK Jr. 
[01:03:00]  QP doll.  Oh, wait,  they really have that.  Did you see this?  In the post, yeah.  JFK Jr.,  little QP doll.  The Danbury men  putting it out.  It's little JFK Jr.  saluting  like he did  at his dad's funeral.  He looks like  one of the Beatles  in that, doesn't he?  A gold range?  A gold range?  You're not.  You know what,  Rod, I go on, Anthony?  It's the Rockaway Beach  wave pool.  Oh, God.  That was, 
[01:03:30]  that's still on the cover  of the New York paper.  That's why I'm here, baby.  That's horrible.  Tragic.  Three girls drowned  in Rockaway Beach.  It's just a ride.  My God.  You know,  lifeguards are sleeping.  I don't know what happened.  That is awful  because that's too new.  You have to wait  maybe 80 years from now.  They make a ride at it  because that seems  to be what happens.  All right.  We better take a break.  Jay Moore has  entered the par-tay. 
[01:04:00]  There's some great ideas  for kid games  on the phones.  We might have to go  right to the phones  after break here.  Hey,  is the man boot guy  here too?  Join us at the  Phil Hartman  Shooting Gallery.  Oh, no.  Ding, ding.  Ow, that hurt.  Hey.  God, I wish I knew  her name,  the Houston Mother  Dunk Tank.  God, I can't remember  the name.  Five kids in a tub.  You might remember me  when I was alive.  Oh. 
[01:04:30]  Sorry, Jay.  It's close to home,  doesn't it?  Phil Hartman.  Look at Jay.  No, I just,  I could,  it got written down  and I just  couldn't go there, right?  No, I couldn't go there.  It was in my head.  See, we hit a line  for you  that you didn't want  to pass.  I understand.  Okay.  I still feel bad  about Rockaway  wave.  Well, you should.  I'm like,  those are someone's  kids.  I know, see?  That person  could be listening.  We're making a point  here.  There was a point  to be made.  The Titanic,  Rod, 
[01:05:00]  is no different  than any of these  other tragedies.  It's inappropriate.  Thank you, Jay.  Jay Moore up next,  a guy with man boobs,  Kimmy from Survivor,  Playboy interviewer  coming down  to get drunk  with us.  Nice.  Have fun on the way.  O.P.  Oh, God damn it.  No!  Son of a bitch! 
[01:05:30]  No!  Oh, God damn it!  No!  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  O.P.  and Anthony.  I'm a mental case.  Yeah.  Ah, Anthony,  ultimate V.  Yeah, you're under  a lot of stress.

Obi Anthony.  1027 WNEW. 
[01:07:00]  That's right.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Are you ready?  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  And we're back  with the Obi and Anthony show.  Are you ready?  I hear Sandy Kane's upstairs.  Get out of here.  We have a full house today. 
[01:07:30]  Is she upstairs?  That's clutch, by the way.  Careful with that mic.  We have plenty of people  that haven't seen  Twato yet.  Have you ever seen it?  Who has not seen Twato?  Who hasn't seen Twato?  Jim Norton has not seen Twato.  Cowbell Bill has not seen Twato.  Twato.  Jay Moore, have you seen Twato?  No.  You have not seen Twato?  I went to Busch Gardens  with my family  and we went on the  Abner Louima plunger pinata.  And I got to tell you,  not what I bargained for.  I mean, I know every ride's free  once you pay to get in the park, 
[01:08:00]  but after that,  don't go on that ride  like first or second  because you're going to just  want to go home  and lay in the tub  and in the fetal position.  And explain where we are right now.  Well, this is pretty crazy.  We were talking about  the Titanic slide.  We've got to set it up now.  Have you seen the...  Obviously, you did.  I saw it on the way home  last night.  They have a huge blow-up slide  that is at fares  or backyard parties.  You can rent this thing out.  It's the Titanic  sinking into your lawn.  There's the back of the ship 
[01:08:30]  all up in the air  and you climb up  and slide down the decks.  Seems harmless and fun  until you think that  it's based on something  that killed a lot of people  in a horrible way.  But enough time went by,  I guess,  that it's okay.  And now people are checking in  with their own little rides  based on horrible things  that have happened recently.  And for some reason,  those are terrible,  but the Titanic thing is a ride.  Hey, Anthony,  I'm sure the people  of the Titanic  are taking great pleasure  in heaven  knowing they're being  immortalized  at the Sussex County Fair. 
[01:09:00]  Can I slide down  with my pig?  No.  I'm not.  I'm not coming down.  There's some spirit,  maybe, you know,  that died there  in a horrible way,  not able to find  his way to the light.  Maybe he walked around  and saw kids  sliding down the Titanic.  Who knows?  How about the  David Koresh Funhouse?  That's a good one.  Hard to get at him,  just like any other funhouse.  And the Titanic thing also, 
[01:09:30]  if you're a handicapped,  it turns into  the Leon Klinghoffer ride  where you just  fly off the deck.  Just a nice way  to be remembered,  you know,  some fat dyke soccer mom  putting her  should-have-been  stillborn kid  on a little ride.  As a kid,  don't listen to  Opie and Anthony,  that's not nice.  Oh, God,  that's horrible.  Bluto writes,  how about the  O.J. Simpson game,  pin the knife  on wife game?  That's funny.  Don't go anywhere  until you catch  the Michael Jackson  finger puppet show,  which is,  I heard that's  really good, though, 
[01:10:00]  at the fairs.  Butt Munch writes,  hey, how about  the baby Jessica's  sewage pipe ride?  I'm gonna do  Diallo  Cowboy Western  shootout.  He can stay  in the Robert Blake  honeymoon suite.  The Leon Klinghoffer  dunk tank.  Mmm, mmm,  friends.  Leon Klinghoffer  dunk tank.  Mmm.  Go on a Russian  sub-ride.  Yes.  Go on a Russian  sub-ride.  Reconnaissance  plane bumpy-bumping 
[01:10:30]  you.  Stand from Hoboken,  the princess died  go-karts.  And Taylor,  the Dale Earnhardt  roll-barless bumper  cars.  The Hans device  bumper cars.  Awful.  Oh.  All right.  Well, there you  have it.  Yeah, there you  go.  Uh, Cindy Kane's  upstairs.  You want to check  out Twato again?  Do you guys know  Jim Norton's at  the Stress Factory  this weekend?  Of course we do.  732-545-42... 
[01:11:00]  No, it's  545-ha-ha.  That's 4242  spells out  ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  There's a clever  little twist on  a phone.  I have nothing to  promote, gentlemen.  Too bad he  couldn't spell...  Dom, what's  going on?  Creep.  Dom.  Dom.  He's coming  out of your  door.  Dom?  He's not there?  Are you retarded,  sir?  You.  You talking that  just said hello.  You.  Hi, Opie and  Anthony.  You guys are  rocking. 
[01:11:30]  We were.  You guys are  legends, except that  you have a bunch of  B-list celebrities and a  character actor in  Jay Moore.  Oh, that's funny.  You waited over an  hour to say that,  huh?  That's to Howard  Stern.  Wow.  Oh, the Howard  Stern thing.  Oh, you got us,  dude.  That's to him.  Yeah, you got us,  of course.  Good job.  30-year-old, lives in  his mom's rec room.  He's got NFL sheets and  Spider-Man, but GVD.  And I'm a character  actor.  The power move I'm  about to make, buddy, 
[01:12:00]  is going to leave  everyone you know in  my wake.  You talk good.  So just remember  those words in a  year or two.  Sir, why do you  have addiction like  that?  It's coming up.  Are you going to  join CBS today, you  faggot?  Sir, why do you  have addiction like  that guy?  That's a terrible gig.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Sir, why do you  talk with that  addiction?  Was your mother  trampled by a  Clydesdale?  Faggy.  Just embarrassed  himself and Howard.  I like to listen to  the morning.  I'm awake.  You're a B-list 
[01:12:30]  celebrity now?  That's an upgrade  for you.  No.  It went from F to  B.  Nice.  Thank you, sir.  I mean, it was  Norton, like, you  know, comedy  cellar, five in the  morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now it's B-list  celebrity.  Jim Norton.  I, you know, I  think that's a,  that's a, I think  that's good.  It is an upgrade and  I appreciate it.  Very nice.  And I'm a character  actor.  I'm suddenly John  Casale.  Who?  I was passed  over. 
[01:13:00]  Wait, who's John  Casale?  Fredo.  Oh, Fredo.  Okay, I'm sorry.  And Sal.  Jackass.  Couple of, there's  something to be said  about jackasses, Jim.  There really is.  All right, well,  we're sitting here.  Real fast, you guys,  I apologize, but I  got to bust out a  shout to my  Colombian Navy  cab driver today.  Ever just get in the  coolest cab ever?  No.  You guys are, every  once in a while you're  getting that, Ben knows  what I'm talking about.  Every once in a while  you get in the cab.  I got in a cab with a  guy that drove  Marilyn Monroe around. 
[01:13:30]  How come there's always  like a billboard between  Opie and I?  Yeah, I know.  It's like every time I  talk to Opie, I'm  talking to like his  lat muscle.  That's all I see of  Opie is a red lat muscle.  I'm ducking down so I  can see you.  I know, I'm ducking  down too.  Did you see our  billboard in Times  Square?  I will now.  Is it great?  It's ridiculous.  My cab driver was  from Columbia and he  just lights up a cigarette  the second I get in and  didn't ask me if it was  okay.  And I'm talking to him  and he said he was in  the Colombian Navy and he  just told me about all  the chicks he got in the 
[01:14:00]  Colombian Navy.  You could build 13  episodes around that.  I didn't even know  they had boats.  Did you know Columbia  had a Navy?  I didn't know that.  I thought they just  smuggled Coke with  their boats.  I told him I'd say his  name on the radio.  Well, he just did.  Santa Canis here and  a guy with man boobs.  By the way, I saw  the man boobs.  Very beautiful  areolas.  By the way, on the  way, Brother Joe's  George Harrison song.  Yeah, my brother just  came in.  Didn't even have time  to record it.  He's got the lyric 
[01:14:30]  sheet and his guitar  with him for a George  Harrison song.  This is an exclusive.  Is this done to the  Patty Duke theme?  No, actually not.  Go figure that one  out.  All right.  I was on the phone  with Joe on the way.  He wrote that on the  way in here.  Look at that.  A legendary song  written on a cocktail  napkin in the back  of a cab.  Is that always the way?  Yes.  That's always the way  the classics are  jotted down.  That's how they did  Stairway to Heaven.  I saw it.  Keith Richards wakes up  and jots down  Jumpin' Jack Flash  and passes back out.  Two days later,  he finds it under a  syringe and says,  hey, look what I found. 
[01:15:00]  Doesn't even remember.  Doesn't even remember  waking up and  ripping off that riff.  45 minutes of snoring.  Yeah, that's right.  The tape has 45 minutes  of snoring after his riff.  Satisfaction.  Satisfaction riff, yeah.  Oh, that's what it is?  Satisfaction.  He woke up in the  middle of the night  and, uh...  Now, where's Sandy Cain?  You gotta see Twado.  And then passed out  and had no clue  that he did it.  Whoever hasn't seen Twado,  Sandy Cain, come in here.  Sandy Cain!  Come in here.  Look how I'm  still laying turning around.  Well, you better turn around  because she's got  a big thing in her hand. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, gorgeous.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  I don't want to shake your hand  after you had your hand  all over that dildo.  Yeah, you don't know  where it's going to be.  Look at everybody  moves way over.  Bill's coming over  to this side.  We gotta get her  on our mic.  Unfortunately.  We're gonna have to get  more mics for this studio.  Sandy Cain has very nice...  You look nice.  You're not dressed up  like a headless.  Yeah, but wait.  Oh, she's got red there.  You got red bra  and panties on?  Yeah, I definitely do.  Nine-year-old cleavage.  Oh, look at you.  You're so gorgeous. 
[01:16:00]  How does it feel  having a house fall on you?  Is this Norton?  That's Jim Norton.  I love you.  B-movie actor.  The dildo's gotta bend to it.  Me and my middle finger  love him.  He's a B-list celebrity.  About five o'clock  every day when I hear you.  Hey, Sandy.  What?  Would you mind giving  Jim an oral favor?  I'd love to.  Oh, my God.  Oh, really?  Jim, would you take  that from that?  Now, we know that  Jim Norton is an admitted 
[01:16:30]  sexaholic.  I just want to see  how far he would go.  He's my type, really.  Am I your type?  Are you well-hung?  Jim, she's a B-list celebrity.  Are you well-hung?  Not compared to what  you're holding, I'm not.  No.  Okay.  Jim, would you allow  this to happen?  Possibly.  Hey, Sandy's...  You were wonderful  getting out of the tub  in The Shining, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, it's possible.  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  Oh, that.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  That old gag.  She comes in with  all this vaudevillian comedy.  Sandy, just show Jim  your lower teeth, though.  Oh.  That doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother you.  Oh, thank you.  What bothers you?  Nothing bothers me.  Oh, good.  My type, see?  What's with your lower teeth?  I think he said  nothing bothers you.  I'm going to ask you.  He mentioned it,  so I'm going to ask you.  Okay, do we have to go through that?  No.  Look at Jim slipping in peaks  at like a breast.  Give a tissue.  Oh, I know.  He's looking at us.  I don't even know you.  I like a woman with gum cancer. 
[01:17:30]  Now, that's the thing.  You're not cool.  You're not cool.  You're not down.  He's not cool, though.  You're smitten with her  when he backs out of that one.  Smitten?  I'm just kidding.  I know.  He never apologizes.  Nice, right?  Look, Thornton's grabbing.  Oh, my God.  You don't know what you're touching.  Do not touch her.  I just patted the heinous.  Don't touch.  Jim, you've got to go wash.  No, look.  Come on, Jim.  Not because we care about Sandy.  We care about you.  Thank you very much.  That's nice.  Hey, Doug from Springfield.  What is your sissy?  You've got to take one for the team  for once. 
[01:18:00]  This guy, look at this.  Jim, would you be willing  to go into the Jaymore suite,  have the deed done,  and then come back  and report what it was all about?  Because she seems like  she's real good at it.  Yeah, I would sooner  murder Ben  and felch his body.  And the guy that's calling in,  I don't do outrageous,  wacky things.  I don't come in here  with a little hat  with a propeller on it.  I just get hookers  and tell stories.  You're like Mr. Big Deal,  outrageous.  No, I'm just me.  I tell true stories.  I'm not Mr. Wacky, outrageous. 
[01:18:30]  Well, this would be  another true story you'd tell.  Yeah.  I don't do things  for the story.  You know what I mean?  Like butterscotch  putting that to true...  I didn't plan on a girl  having diarrhea on my fingers.  It happened.  So I talked about it  on the air.  I'll tell you what,  buddy,  don't plan on this happening.  And it'll happen.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Wait a minute.  Thank you.  I don't think Jim wants...  I thought it was worth asking.  Jim, I'm actually  really surprised  because Sandy Cain  is a woman  who keeps herself up  as well as she can  considering she's  in triple digits.  and she's got her own 
[01:19:00]  television show  that's all about sex.  She walks around  with a dildo  that's vibrating,  dancing around for you, Jim.  It spins.  Hey, Sandy Cain,  show your technique  on Mr. Dildo.  No, no.  Do the...  Jim, this is right  up your alley.  Do the mouth technique.  Show the mouth technique  on Mr. Dildo.  I never showed it to you before.  Well, go ahead.  Let's...  Let's see what it looks like.  Jim, she's got her own  TV show.  The whole thing is  I would like to do it 
[01:19:30]  to a real man.  Well, I'm still...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  They're dumping out of that.  Yeah, you can't say that.  I understand where you like  to put that.  When it comes to oral,  I like a real man.  Is that terrible to say?  Is that true or what?  I can't tell...  I like a real man.  Can we just see you on there?  Can we just see you doing that?  What about you, man?  Are you up?  Are you up?  No, I'm packing a half right now.  It's awful.  What?  It's like a baby's.  It won't bend left or right.  Oh, let's see.  I mean, maybe we know.  No action, huh? 
[01:20:00]  Why don't you try to arouse him?  No, don't touch him.  Seriously.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Just so we're all on the same team.  Sandy, show these guys Twato.  They have not seen Twato yet.  That's Sandy Kane?  Yeah.  I thought it was Eleanor Douglas.  I have bigger breasts.  True.  All right.  Looks like something out of a Tim Burton film.  She's great.  I like her.  But I think she's very sexy, by the way.  I love that show.  Actually, that was the best show on TV. 
[01:20:30]  The best show.  Wait, wait.  What was the character from Night Before Christmas?  Yeah.  Was he Twato?  Yeah, Nightmare Before Christmas.  Let's see Twato.  Okay.  All right.  Look.  Stand back by the door, kind of.  Hold on.  You kept these guys both at the same time.  I am so hot.  Back up.  Back up, Sandy.  Is this going to smell?  I can't believe it.  No.  It's going to smell.  So, what's the problem?  All right, Sandy.  Show them Twato.  With all the smells they have in this room.  Okay.  That's all right.  Show them Twato.  We're driving through.  Look at this.  You should be bartending in Seaside Heights.  You tell me what this is. 
[01:21:00]  Ready?  Jay Moore and Jim Norton.  Oh, my God.  You want to smell it?  No.  Jay, what is that?  That is.  What is that?  It looks like a walnut.  It is Twato.  It's Twato.  You have a wasp nest growing on you.  Oh, God.  It moved.  Wow.  Yeah, a wasp nest.  Oh, God.  I don't know what it is, but I do know I wouldn't have it for long.  It's a piece of hubba bubba. 
[01:21:30]  It looks like her vag is graduating college.  It's got a little cap and tassel on it, right?  Can't you have that taken off?  They could do that.  They could do something with that.  Maybe you could bite it off for me.  Oh, come on.  It's like polishing a 50 Buick.  Let me go to Liz.  That's up on blocks.  Our wet t-shirt winner.  Liz, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  My older sister is a doctor, and she used to work at a sex clinic down in Roanoke, Virginia.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  So a couple weeks ago, I was on the internet, and I showed her the picture of the sandy cane  growth.  Yeah.  She told me that's like 10 or 15-year-old genital warts, without a doubt.  Nice.  10 or 15 years old.  And then she fondled it.  What vintage is that?  I just leave it alone.  It doesn't bother me.  You just fondled it, and now you...  Yeah, because it's out, so it touched me.  But now you don't want anyone touching you.  That's why people don't like to touch you.  Do you want to touch it, Anthony?  No.  Get away from me.  Don't even say that.  Kim, would you like to see what she calls a hemorrhoid?  Yeah, can I see the hemorrhoid?  Look at the hemorrhoid.  I've never met you before. 
[01:22:30]  Check out the roid.  You've got to see the roid.  You're a fan of my hemorrhoid.  I just came from Taco Bell, so I'm cool.  I don't know if I'm a fan of it, but I...  You've got to see the roid, man.  All right.  She's getting to the roid area.  I wonder if Twotto got a letter from the IRS.  Hey, Twotto's getting 300 bucks.  That thing inside of there?  Yeah, it's really not out.  It's not out.  Push, push.  Pardon me.  Did she just blast one out?  It sounded like it.  Who the hell just farted?  Oh, I think she did when she was pushing. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, she was pushing, and she just blasted one.  She tried to pop her hemorrhoid out, and she just farted.  I saw the hemorrhoid.  It looks like the baby from It's Alive.  It's a little like the wart, don't you?  I am really hard to make queasy.  Right.  What got you the actual...  That's okay. 
[01:23:30]  Sorry, Jim.  She was pushing to push it out.  She's growing hair.  The fart didn't hurt.  It's like throwing a rock on Hiroshima.  It doesn't matter anymore.  Isn't that disgusting?  Where's Laird?  Here's my buddy, Jim Laird.  Show Jim Laird Twato.  Everyone that comes in has got to see Twato.  Laird, look at Twato.  Watch this.  This is the most disgusting thing.  Look.  Look at this.  Sandy, flap it around like you did before.  He's like, hey, there you go.  You don't see every day.  Right.  You should put a little earring in it.  I literally...  Put an earring in it. 
[01:24:00]  You know what, you guys?  I haven't seen my wife in three weeks.  I still haven't seen her.  She's coming home at eight o'clock tonight.  Yeah.  There's no way I'm looking at Twato.  I'm going to get coffee.  Oh, you're not even going to...  You don't even want to be in here.  I can't even risk because it's already embedded in my brain like a Vietnam rape.  So you don't want to taint...  She's an effing human being, man.  You don't want to taint her.  I didn't know you were married, man.  I didn't know you were married.  I'm all of you.  I didn't know you were married.  What's wrong with you, Taylor?  She's an effing human being, man. 
[01:24:30]  Sandy, we have to hose you down now, man.  I never saw a crotch that looked like Bosnia.  Yeah, well, that's it.  No, but it's really weird to be with a lot of gorgeous men,  and you're looking at that and not the middle thing.  What's the...  The lips.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  Don't say anymore.  No, hold on.  It's a classy show.  It's a classy show.  No, no, just hold on.  Because now she starts saying things.  That is funny.  Don't say anything else, okay?  You would like to show Jim another part of your body. 
[01:25:00]  We can say that.  Yellowness now.  The part that's very close to where Twato's growing from.  Yes.  Right.  I've got that point.  All right, let's...  Let me just give your opinion.  Okay.  All right.  I can't...  I can't see.  You have to...  You have to...  What are you...  Yeah, well, just give her a hand.  You have to open up.  You have to...  You have to...  This was no voting accident.  It's hard to see because, let's just say it's... 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Uh-oh.  Something else?  What was that?  Dude, what did you just see?  What did you just see?  Oh, no.  Sandy said, uh-oh.  She doesn't even know.  Did I wipe?  And those beaches will stay open.  It's the 4th of July.  Is it the little Kittner voice spilling out all over the floor?  What is it?  Give me a little...  I don't even know how to describe what I just saw.  What...  It was like an overgrown...  It was like an overgrown pimple or something.  It looked like...  It looked like a pencil eraser that came off the pencil.  Come to think of it. 
[01:26:00]  I do have some other growth in there.  Oh, my God.  And you just saw it?  Yeah.  How big?  It sounds like that long.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  Rick, you want to sketch another one out?  Rick, you're all right.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  Kathy.  Hi.  How do you think I got this way?  Shut up.  We're going to start throwing stuff at you again.  Kathy.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  I just want to say that I love your show.  Thank you.  And that skank fart came through loud and clear on the radio.  The fart did come out loud and clear. 
[01:26:30]  It did.  Totally heard it.  Norton was like...  And it was the sexiest thing that's happened.  Norton was two feet from that.  He felt the breeze.  Awful.  I've never seen like...  I mean, a lot of women have...  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  I'm looking at a video of it.  Ew.  Oh.  Whoa, man.  Dude.  Oh.  That looks like...  Yeah, there is something in there.  I just remembered. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  No, there is something in there.  Ant's looking at the video of it.  I just looked at the video.  Let me tell you what that looks like down there.  It looks like somebody cut up some veal and threw it on the barbershop floor.  After Metallica got their haircuts.  There is a growth in there.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Slow down.  My name is John Plank.  You know?  That was contracted around 57.  Yeah.  Slow down there, Sandy.  Dave, what's up?  Yo.  I'm here.  Ready?  One second.  Sandy Kane? 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  I want you to repeat after me.  Say, hey, Mr. Carter.  Hey, Mr. Conner.  Hey, Mr. Conner.  Oh, damn it.  No, it didn't sound like Arnold Horst.  What is he, a pastor or what?  It's funny.  The voice of, what was his name, Horshack?  Yeah.  And the ass crack of Juan Epstein's hair.  All right. 
[01:28:00]  That is a goddamn mess down there.  You should go to a doctor, Sandy.  You should go to a doctor.  Why should I go to a doctor?  I love it down here.  Dr. Horkian, I mean.  Dr. Horkian.  Okay.  Is it a laugh or a miscarriage?  Yeah, you got it.  It's messed up down there.  But, you know, a woman goes through a lot.  I was going to a very well-endowed man for a long time, and it's, like, kind of loose.  What was he using?  A shovel?  How old a gal are you? 
[01:28:30]  A gal?  Yeah, a thing.  How old a gal?  How old a specimen are you?  I guess when you're older, you're called a gal.  How old are you, Sandy Kane?  Can you keep a secret?  That's mine.  So can I, or that's mine.  That's mine.  She keeps her age a secret, but we've got to see every goddamn thing growing.  Would you wow me?  Definitely.  It's not Wednesday, though.  It doesn't matter. 
[01:29:00]  Would you wow me?  You could wow me by leaving.  I like him.  And he's funny.  He's funny.  Thank you.  I'm quite the way.  At least he's funny.  Quite the way.  Hysterical.  She's got interesting boobs.  Yeah, so does Nancy Reagan.  I can't see them.  Honey, I'm taking them out, baby.  Wait till you see this mess.  Just when you thought it wasn't bad enough.  Look at these.  Should I take my brassiere off?  Yeah.  How do you like it?  How do you like your breasts? 
[01:29:30]  On other people.  You're quite a pistol, you.  I love your little comics in Playboy.  Go ahead.  Go ahead there.  I was going to say, have you been breastfed?  Yeah, but I can't because I have a sore in my mouth.  Oh.  What a coincidence.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  Scene one, scene of both.  That's cool.  I like that because a lot of them have nipples and that's irritating. 
[01:30:00]  Those are really nice.  She took off a bra and caused a self-induced knee injury.  Look at those.  Oh, my God.  You know.  They have to be exercised.  What happened to the nips, though?  They're gone.  They're inside.  Would you like to get it out?  Inside what?  Your crotch?  Looks like you were attacked on this old house.  They've got to be sucked out.  So I need the right man.  Oh, God.  What planet are you going to look on?  Because I'll tell you, no man.  I couldn't see a guy going, yeah, well, it's late. 
[01:30:30]  It's four in the morning.  All the rest of the chicks left.  The lights are out.  And you know something?  I'm turning gay because there's no way in hell a guy would want to do anything with that.  You think a good punch in the belly would pop around?  Because Jim's just the guy.  This is the first aid kit from the men's room.  Please do something.  I literally.  Oh, my God.  Jay, look at those things.  No, I can't because I will vomit.  I took a red eye. 
[01:31:00]  My schedule's a little wacky right now.  My stomach's a little queasy.  What kind of cheese is in those indentations?  Don't touch me.  You're the only girl that could actually dance in New Jersey without pasties.  I just did my own show, so there's glue on them.  So I get pasties on.  I wear glue.  I wear glue.  They're I wear glue.  Are you sure that's right?  I just.  Yeah.  I should have washed my nipples. 
[01:31:30]  They look like anuses.  Jay Moore coming to the Dallas Improv.  Heads up, Dallas.  Cleveland Improv.  Slam man's coming.  Go ahead.  I really don't want to see those breasts this Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at the stress factory.  Wait, farted again.  Oh, she farted again.  She is the most disgusting woman.  I'm sorry, man.  I can't help it.  You are a heinous woman.  I came from Taco Bell.  I couldn't help it.  She didn't help it. 
[01:32:00]  I wanted my hemorrhage to be at.  She was blasted.  Does she look like the monster from Evil Dead 2?  Is that the one?  Yeah.  When he's hacking through all the bodies and the monsters on the top of the house?  Yeah.  The Evil Dead 2.  Sandy, put your thumb in your mouth and blow really hard.  They'll pop out.  How about you?  Would you like to get one out?  No.  God.  Maybe with a car.  All right.  Hey, we should take a break.  She reminds me of the girl from the Downward Spiral thing we were checking out before.  Oh, yeah.  The mug shots.  We've got to get into that next.  We have to.  Have to. 
[01:32:30]  We want to.  We want to hear Brother Joe's George Harrison song.  Yeah.  We're going to do that after we take a break, okay?  Thank you, Sandy.  Anytime, Einstein.

Brian, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just heard that commercial.  With a bad Fred Flintstone on it, you guys are playing.  Yeah, fake Fred.  I just, we just all mentioned that in the studio here.  Like, ah, it's fake Fred.  As soon as I heard a, hey, Barney. 
[01:34:30]  I hate fake Fred.  I just thought that was a riot.  You guys grow up with real Fred Flintstone, and then they got, you know, Barney's voice,  and then the guy that did Fred died, but they still had Mel Blanc doing Barney's voice.  So you'd hear Barney's like, hey, Fred, you want to go bowling?  And then the fake Fred would be, okay, Barney, I'll get my bowling ball.  Like, ah.  What happened to Fred?  You guys remember the first Barney voice?  Yeah.  When Barney was like semi-retarded?  Okay.  I do remember that.  He just said, all he said, every other word was, hey, Barney, keep it down. 
[01:35:00]  Okay, I'll keep it down, Fred.  I'll keep it down, Barney.  Barney, keep it down.  Barney.  Dallas Improv, coming at you, baby.  You're open.  Stephen Baldwin's version of Barney.  I can't believe I'm this close to the same mic that that hemorrhoid-laden cesspool sewer fishnet stocking left in the back room of Show World sock full of mice having sex. 
[01:35:30]  That's who it was on, and your hands were right on the console.  Wash your hands.  Yeah.  Wash them not.  Jim was coming out of the men's room, and he looked at me and goes, that was really disturbing.  Yeah.  Jim Norton said that.  I feel violent.  Guy rents major porn.  That kind of college, if she ever went, would have to get hazard pay.  Are you five nine tonight, Brother Joe?  Five nine, yeah, tonight.  Yes, certainly am.  Hey, speaking of Norton, Michael writes, tell Norton I saw his TV interview in Montreal last week. 
[01:36:00]  You were doing what, the Montreal Comedy Festival?  Yeah.  The reporter asked him if he hoped to get a sitcom from his routine.  Norton told him he doubts it, since his idea of comedy is getting a bunch of celebrities and hookers together and letting them kill each other.  And then this guy writes, there was complete silence from the reporter.  I was laughing my ass off in the hotel.  Oh, cool, man.  Yeah, that was a stupid little segment we did, and I knew they would hate me.  You went up to Montreal?  Yeah, I was thinking.  Why did I get you a big break?  I did not. 
[01:36:30]  I could be the next Drew Carey.  No, I was doing a nasty show.  How much did you get paid?  I'll tell you off air, it was good, actually.  Oh, you got paid.  Hey, look at that.  Hey, Garrett Morris is outside the studio.  Garrett Morris is here.  Yeah.  Garrett Morris got shot in an ATM.  I heard about that a while ago.  That's a man.  And here he is.  You know what I mean?  Taking some gunfire.  Now, look at him.  Nice to have one talented SNL member here. 
[01:37:00]  Look at him now.  Oh, my God.  What did he say?  What did he say?  Nice to have one talented SNL alumni here.  Very happy if Mr. Morris arrived.  Holy Jesus.  You know what?  I never went to Montreal to try to get it.  Wait, what happened to Garrett Morris?  I'm going to go to Montreal.  Fine.  Something might be happening to Garrett Morris.  No, no, no.  He was supposed to be.  He's a little early, and that's because he's got his 520 up at 1010 wins.  Ah.  And then he's coming down to us.  Well, that's a different type of interview. 
[01:37:30]  I thought you told Garrett Morris, which we've done many times on this show, to go downstairs  and get a cup of coffee.  We're not ready for you because we're hanging out with Sandy Kane and Twato.  No.  No, no, no.  Twato.  She was asking me about Ralph Howard, and I told her he's upstairs.  Oh, all right.  1010 wins news.  We'll get Garrett Morris on a little later.  Well, we got Brother Joe in here.  He wants to do a George Harrison song.  We also have tape of Anthony's mom drunk singing.  Oh, this.  Anthony, I heard a little of it.  Did you?  It sounded like the woman they arrest on cops that's drunk and on PCP, and the kids 
[01:38:00]  are just running around in nasty diapers.  What happened?  And then they put her in their holding tank.  She just loses her mind and starts singing.  I don't care.  You want the lead up?  That's what it sounds like.  Let Joe give a lead up to this.  I'll give a lead up for this one.  How did this happen?  Brother Joe.  It was my birthday on Friday, and we ended up going down to it.  Thank you.  We ended up going out to eat dinner and had a couple of pitchers of margaritas.  Oh, great.  My family can drink. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, S.  Oh, yeah.  Big time.  And my mother kept on saying, my mom kept on saying to Dawn about how good Joe makes  her sound in the studio.  In the song parodies and singing.  Yeah, Dawn got a good, but Dawn's got a good voice.  Yeah, but mom doesn't understand that.  She thinks it's magic.  It's studio magic.  Like Milli Vanilli or something.  Right, exactly.  Right.  Okay.  And she said, I bet I can sing just as good as Dawn.  I said, Ma, come on down.  And all Joe's thinking is, oh, this will be on the show. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  Not only in New York, now in eight other cities.  Oh, my God.  She can't even travel without being ridiculed.  So, mom singing songs.  Yes.  In the studio.  In particular, yes.  What song did she choose to sing?  Well, she tried singing a Carole King song, I Feel the Earth Move, but that was just a  little too good, believe it or not.  So, I saved the tape from Mercedes Benz.  Oh, no.  She tried.  Which is a lot of like acapella. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, it is.  It's all acapella.  She tried singing Mercedes Benz.  Yeah, it's a trip.  You're out of the will.  It was a lot of fun.  I've been out of the will for years.  All right.  Melissa.  So, we'll buckle in.  Strap in for this one.  It's mine and Joe's mom.  Yeah.  You're singing.  Anthony, your family can drink and my family can Prozac.  I've got to get together and have a party.  This actually sounds like one of like Janis Joplin's showing up really drunk outtakes.  Oh, really? 
[01:40:00]  Like when she was drunk before she killed herself?  I listened to a little of it and your mom hits a couple notes and she's totally committed  to it.  Right.  Oh, really?  She is cutting an album for the free world.  This is a hit and she knows it.  All right.  Here's Phil Spector's winking at her the whole time.  Here's Anthony's mom singing.  Let's get this.  Rock on, baby.  What's her name?  Some Joplin.  Rosemary.  Rosemary.  Rock and roll, baby.  All you have to do.  I do it in one take.  Okay.  Sounds like Sandy Cain.  I'm going to tell you two notes.  Okay.  Put on the headphones.  Okay. 
[01:40:30]  Here's my headphones.  What the f***?  Where's your can?  Cans?  I don't have those.  Cans.  Oh, God.  Could I do it like in one take?  Feedback, everything.  I don't know, but I was getting feedback right in my ear.  I have to make my voice grab.  I could do this.  Joseph, if it takes me more than once to do it, but I want to do it, I want you to save 
[01:41:00]  it for posterity.  She's having it.  I've got to stop the tape.  Your mom has the hottest voice.  Oh, God.  She really does, though.  Stop it.  She has a really hot voice.  Jim, help me out.  Very.  The only thing is that she wants to do it in one take.  It keeps reminding me of Ed Wood, but she is very sexy.  One take.  That's perfect.  Perfect.  Print it.  But the voice is very hot.  It's very sexy voice. 
[01:41:30]  It's called drunk.  There we go.  Anthony's mom.  The whole basement is here.  Do I have a keeper?  Are you kidding me?  Check into the mic.  Check.  This is my hell on holidays.  It sounds like the whole basement and the whole upstairs and probably three stories high  could hear me.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[01:42:00]  My friends all drive horses.  I must make a man work hard on my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Lord, won't you buy me a color TV?  Shut up!  Stop!  The dollars is waiting for me. 
[01:42:30]  Quiet.  Oh, f*** me.  Oh, Lord.  I forgot the word.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Oh, my God.  On the town.  Not in on me.  Stop.  No.  On the town.  I ain't going to land there.  I don't find that.  I can see it.  What?  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, Lord.  That's not an old town.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  My friends all drive horses.  I must make a man work hard on my life with no help from my friends.  Oh, Lord.  Won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  That's it. 
[01:43:30]  I forgot the f***ing words, but I like what I did.  I like it.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Holy smoke.  Excuse me, but I do believe that sucks ass.  Dolphins are beaching themselves in Coney Island.  I'm a crooner, spank.  Barber of Seville. 
[01:44:00]  Figaro.  Tommy, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  There you go.  Yo, first of all, it's an honor to be talking to such a comic genius, but, uh, Ant, I didn't  know your mom had a cable access show in Manhattan during the week.  Oh, Sandy came.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, I gotta tell you, Ant, your mom sounds pretty hot, but once you start singing  Jesus Christ, my chubby crawled inwards.  Horrible.  Hey, Chet, what's up?  What's up, Ant?  I want to cast my vote for your mom in the MILF contest. 
[01:44:30]  And it was late.  I won her, buddy.  Holy Jesus.  That was awful.  People saying, uh, my mom and Lisa from sales should make a duet.  Oh!  Jason, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  Yo, I want to know, could somebody go check out Janis Joplin's grave?  I think the rotten corpse is crawling out to go strangle your mother for that rendition.  There, eh?  That was Janis from the grave.  Dan from Homewoken checking in.  Dan from Homewoken, I guess Joe, Ant, and Dawn got their musical talent from their father. 
[01:45:00]  I told you she was going for it, man.  Is that the new Fred Flintstone voice?  Gotta give her the credit.  I thought she'd call in by now.  Stop my dog's howling.  Oh, that's funny.  Wow.  That's funny.  I just admire her moxie, man.  She went at it.  Oh, she's got moxie.  She wanted to put Dawn on the canvas, man.  That sounds like...  She went to the mat ready to roll.  You know.  Eli saying, uh, your mom sounds like Joan Rivers on crack. 
[01:45:30]  Oh!  I have some other tape on her saying that Sal can't sing or dance.  Well, that we've seen.  That I should bring in.  Now I want to hear the song that she sang real well.  You have to hear in that spectacle.  Knock on Wood, I want to hear now.  Janis Joplin checking in.  I'm finally glad to be dead.  You have your mom's Knock on Wood tape still?  Now I want to hear her singing it good.  I shall definitely win the MILF contest.  God, that was awful. 
[01:46:00]  I liked it.  And I know Joe's just like...  Joe's looking at it the same way the guy that filmed Jimmy the Greek was watching Jimmy the Greek as he was saying all those things.  Just keep going.  Keep going.  No, I got it on tape.  It's going to be great.  I think I filmed in a Hindenburg.  Don't drop the camera.  Yeah, the Hindenburg guy.  Jason.  Yeah.  Hey, go.  I got two questions.  Anthony, what's your mother's liquor of choice?  And how many packs does she smoke a day?  Actually, she doesn't smoke.  All right.  But she likes champagne.  Wine.  Wine. 
[01:46:30]  And if you really put her over the top, you just give her a white Russian.  She sounds like one classy lady.  You should be proud.  A white Russian...  Well, Enlarge Marge sent ya.  Take care, guys.  We're having fun, but I do have to say it.  Answer Marge is a very classy girl.  She loves going out.  The woman's, what, 62?  Yeah.  She loves to party.  Someone you would love to hang with.  It's great.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We got the George Harrison song, but now we got to take a break, it looks like.  Mercedes-Benz stock has mysteriously just plummeted. 
[01:47:00]  Is that stockbroker, Dave?  We got the FU line?  Let's do an FU line as we go to break.  Oh, my God.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The last one.  James from Flushing.  Sorry, but your mom's singing.  Sounds like a burn victim rolling around in salt.  Bravo, James.  All right.  Great.  Very good.  We'll come back with Brother Joe's George Harrison song, okay?  I love my mommy. 
[01:47:30]  Yes.  Let's go to the FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  This is a special FU going out to my boyfriend's dog that I took to the vet today.  I had to take a stool sample, so my car smelled like **** already.  And on the way home, the dog farped in my car.  It got on my passenger seat.  It got inside the seatbelt.  It got inside everywhere.  The emergency brake all over the place. 
[01:48:00]  Dog throw up.  The special **** you goes out to my boyfriend's dog.  Next message.  This is Bobby.  I don't want to leave a big **** you to the lady on the bus.  I was coming home from work.  I was listening to your show, and she told me to turn down my walkman because it was too  effing loud.  She gets a big **** you from me.  Bye.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big FU for Joe at work.  I swear to God, if I ever catch you checking out my junk at the urinals in the men's room  again, I'm going to stick your face in the toilet and make you eat the urinal cake. 
[01:48:30]  End of message.  Keep the 14-year-old away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether to sit here and listen to you guys that drive down there and bash  your heads in with a baseball bat.  Anthony Fidelity Diamond.

And the main.  1027.  The O.P.  N.E.W.  We're back with the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Something's going on with our national number.  It doesn't make sense. 
[01:50:00]  No one is calling it.  You've got to give the number out like a million times until they get used to it.  Yeah, but Cleveland's been calling it like crazy.  Philadelphia's been calling it like crazy.  And we've had three calls today.  No, it was filled up earlier.  And before you idiots call up and go, well, that's because you guys suck and no one wants  to talk to you.  We know that's not true.  It doesn't go from phone lines busy for three hours straight to no one calling.  So give the number out again.  The number is 866-2774.  Wow.  Anthony, we just played a tape of your mom singing. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard that.  Your mom's on the line.  Who's this?  Hello?  Uh-oh, it's Sal.  Yeah.  Sal, hi.  I've got one thing to say first, and then your mom wants to talk.  All right.  I've got to say, thank God I was asleep for that.  Before she recorded that.  Here she comes.  Hold on.  All right.  Sal, it's called Passed Out.  Hello.  Hi, Mom.  Yeah.  Hey, great job.  No, I guess I have no future in the music business. 
[01:51:00]  But, you know, a bunch of guys are calling saying your voice was hot.  Really?  So that's pretty good.  That's what I sounded terrible.  But I'm usually better than that.  Some people are checking in on instant feedback.  The Lord checking in, he said, I'll buy you a whole goddamn dealership.  Just stop singing.  Are you kidding?  Oh, my God.  I think I know who that was.  People saying, just shut up.  Stop.  Your mom might be nice and all, but tell her to stop singing.  Can't sing, huh? 
[01:51:30]  No.  The audition didn't go very well.  No.  As far as you singing.  Well, it was Joseph's fault.  You know, he could have done a better job, you know?  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  You know, he didn't make me sound good.  He makes Dawn sound really good.  Well, Dawn kind of can sing.  You know what I mean?  I never thought of that.  You have really, I got to be blunt here.  You're really bad.  I know.  Your mom sings better than Linda McCartney, though.  Alive or dead?  That's rude.  But she probably had a lot of help, too.  You sound like, a lot of people also saying you sounded like Nancy Kerrigan singing the 
[01:52:00]  seventh inning stretch thing.  Do we have that?  I never heard that.  I really never did.  Oh, well, maybe we can play it for you if we can find it because it's equally as horrible.  Oh, God.  I enjoyed your singing.  But, you know, I had a lot of fun.  Oh, you did?  I had a lot of fun doing that.  Well, you know, booze will do that.  Yeah, well, you know.  Make anything fun.  A couple of pitchers of margaritas.  Was that what you were drinking?  I never drink margaritas.  And you were cursing like a sailor.  All of a sudden, one introduced me to margaritas. 
[01:52:30]  Do you curse like that in church?  Oh, never.  You got a potty mouth.  Nah.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Not me.  All right, let's listen to Nancy Kerrigan.  You just listen in.  Okay, I will.  And hear this.  All right.  Here it comes.  Hey, Chicago, let me hear you.  And a one, and a two, and a three.  Take me out to the balcony.  Take me out to the crowd. 
[01:53:00]  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  I don't care if I ever get back.  So it's root, root, root for the company.  If they don't win, it's a shame.  For it's one, two, three.  Let's get you out at the old ball game.  Nice, right? 
[01:53:30]  Nice.  I'm worse, I think.  I think I was a little worse.  That's the same thing when she was screaming, why me, after she got hit in the knee with a pipe.  Why me?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Too funny.  There you go.  Yeah, she's bad.  You're much better, Mom.  Oh, yeah.  That makes me feel really good now.  All right.  Well, maybe take two will be better.  Yeah.  There'll be no take two, because now I know what Joseph's doing.  He's smuggling these tapes out of the house, and he's going to let you hear every one of them,  and they're all going to be just bad. 
[01:54:00]  No.  I'm not doing it anymore.  One, two, three.  How does it sound?  It sounds like the whole basement and the whole upstairs, and probably three stories  high, could hear you.  Okay, here we go.  Okay.  Here you are.  So, Lord, would you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  My friends all drive Porsches.  I must make amends work hard.  Give no help from my friends. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, Lord.  Did you buy me a Mercedes Benz?  That's good.  Well, you know, you gave it a shot.  I did.  I did.  Okay, well, I've got to go make dinner now.  You want to play Mom, What's in My Pants?  Oh, God.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, of course.  Hey, wait.  Pete's got something.  Pete, what's up?  Pete?  Oh, Pete hung off.  Pete said he wanted to talk to Mars Simpson.  Oh, homie. 
[01:55:00]  All right, Mommy.  Bye, Aunt.  Take it easy.  See you later, Mom.  Bye, Mommy.  You got a cool man.  Oh, Lord.  Watch your mommy.  Hey, mercy.  These Benz.  Hey, where's Garrett Morris?  He's coming in right now.  Yeah, where is he?  Oh, Lord.  Garrett.  Garrett Morris.  What's up?  How y'all doing?  What's up, Garrett?  How are you?  Make yourself at home.  We're just having a little party here.  Swept away.  Oh, my old little girl.  Isn't that a sad story? 
[01:55:30]  Three girls swept away here in New York in a riptide.  Horrible.  You know, you read the story.  Wrote a song about it.  Here goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I just do a song.  I just do a song.  I just do a song.  Yeah.  I do a song.  I do a song.  Stealing from me in living color.  It's a shame about these three girls.  May God bless them.  Yeah.  You know.  But I'm keeping my breasts.  Okay, y'all?  Oh, you don't want to get the...  Those guys out there talking about you guys going to do...  Yeah, we got the man boobs contest. 
[01:56:00]  I'm too young to have my boobs cut.  No?  I'm too young to have them cut.  Well, you look like you keep yourself in shape, so I don't think you need that.  My wife goes crazy over these every night.  Oh, yeah?  She loves my body.  She's crazy.  I mean, really.  She's an animal.  That's what you need.  I take off my shirt.  Can't get rid of it, man.  And she's like...  She just made her 50th birthday.  I hope she isn't listening, you know.  Well, those guys have man boobs, Garrett.  Yeah.  So they need some of the fat sucked out. 
[01:56:30]  They are men.  And what other boobs could they have?  Well, you want to see them?  See how bad they could be?  They can have women boobs.  They're men, right?  Right.  So why is he telling me, since I saw they were men, that they got man boobs?  Did I think they had bear boobs or something like that?  No, but, you know, they call them man boobs.  Or chicken boobs.  If you just say boobs, you default to woman.  You know what I mean?  So if you say man boobs, you know it's a guy with boobs.  Well, since we talk about man boobs, can we bring a woman in here to show us her boobs?  I don't know why.  I don't remember what they look like.  We have a girl, Sandy.  Yeah, because I don't remember what they look like.  Sure.  Why don't we bring them in?  You know, I saw them. 
[01:57:00]  Well, my memory revived.  All right.  Sandy came.  Ve na ka, ve na ka.  This is the quality of you, Garrett.  It's going to make you wish you were back at the ATM.  Oh, Jay.  I'm a guest, man.  I'm a guest.  Hi, baby.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Hello, beautiful.  That's what everyone says.  Oh, my God.  Hello, beautiful.  Hello, beautiful.  Hello, beautiful.  How are you doing?  No, Garrett.  Garrett's always a gentleman.  He always kisses a lady's hand.  Don't worry about it.  Ixnay on Otto's way. 
[01:57:30]  Go get the Lysol.  Go get the chemical.  What?  Get the DDT.  Don't you?  Just remember that I told you last night, okay?  Just remember that I told you last night, okay?  Yeah.  Garrett.  Now, Garrett, on a short notice, the same hand that Sandy Cain used to make sure the hemorrhoid  was visible.  Let's just put it that way.  Now, Garrett, we apologize.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, see, words like hemorrhoids.  You know, I think those are like, you know.  What, hemorrhoid? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, that's below the belt.  Well, she's got them.  But she's got them.  Garrett, you want to see below the belt?  I don't want to see.  Show them what you got, Sandy.  I don't want to hear about no hemorrhoids.  Huh?  Sandy.  Oh, she's in on it, too?  Sandy, Sandy.  But I'm saying, show them Twado.  No, I don't want to see Twado, Garrett.  All-on-one.  Lurch, Lurch, Lurch, Lurch, are you in the car?  Please drive here, please.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hey, wait, no, just show Garrett really fast. 
[01:58:30]  But back up.  But back way up.  I already saw it.  Oh, you did?  I already saw it.  You didn't see this.  I saw it.  I saw the hemorrhoid.  No, this is something a little different, my friend.  Sandy Cain, back way up to the CD rack.  All right.  There you go.  Just give Garrett some room there.  All right.  Okay.  She looks great.  All right.  She looks great.  All right.  Sandy, hurry up.  Let's go.  If she kept walking backwards.  There you go.  A little compliment.  I don't have an edno-hemorrhoid.  No, it's not a hemorrhoid.  It's Twado.  It's Twado.  Check this out.  Twado is an amazing conjoined twin she has growing out of her lap. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, watch this.  Check that out.  Ready?  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh!  What the hell is that, Garrett?  What is that?  We're selling advertising space on it.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have an alien that has been living here.  Yeah.  Doesn't that mean it would be?  I have discovered the alien.  You ever see Total Recall with Twado?  You can cover it up now.  Right?  Okay.  I'll remember this for the rest of my life.  Okay?  No, wait.  You have to show me.  I got it in here.  Okay? 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Because that's something that doesn't leave you very quickly.  So you were serious when you were talking.  Oh, yes.  You got like a thing going on.  The other thing is in the back.  No, there's one just like it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  There's one just like it at the back door.  I don't care.  All right.  Okay.  I'll go down and see it.  Send me a picture.  Okay?  All right.  Lovely lady.  Yeah.  You're a great sport.  Come here.  Hey, why don't you kiss her hand again?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  You just grabbed her hand.  That's bad enough.  That's terrible.  The other men are jealous.  That's all.  Oh, thank you.  That's right.  And remember what I told you last night. 
[02:00:00]  Okay?  Don't we don't want to let them know?  You tell me.  Get away from me.  What would you tell her?  Tell me, baby.  No, I just said, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby.  Right.  Yeah, right?  Very good.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby.  Very well, Dad.  Thank you.  Yeah, thank you.  She's got to tenderize it for that poor chap.  Don't hurt her.  All right.  You let these guys talk to you later?  All the time.  You let these guys talk to you later?  She loves it.  She loves it.  Don't make loud noises like that.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I think if there is some gentleman out here who wants 
[02:00:30]  to come in and protect the beautiful lady from these frivolously abusive guys, you should  do it now, okay?  That's terrible.  Because you can see that this lady is suffering under the weight.  Look, she's just crying and stuff like that.  Oh, she's fine.  Yeah.  She used to dance at the peep show.  Right.  She danced over at which place?  At Show World.  At Show World.  At Show World Center.  The people would throw stuff at her.  At Show World Center.  Show World Center.  That's my favorite.  Over on 8th Avenue and 5th of 2nd, right?  Well, they kind of upped the ante.  Shh, shh, shh. 
[02:01:00]  Don't talk about it.  She was a waitress at the Last Supper.  Now, see, that was really mean.  Very mean-spirited.  That was very mean-spirited.  Yeah.  That's true.  Very mean-spirited.  All right.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying.  That's mean.  You want to see the boobs?  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  You want to see the boobs, Garrett?  You said you wanted someone to pleasure.  Hey, I'm not against seeing boobs.  All right.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Music?  Wait till you see this horror.  Could your mother sing?  Or could you play?  Ladies and gentlemen, I do have a heart condition.  If you hear the heavy breathing, or if you hear a guy cough, call- 
[02:01:30]  We'll help you out.  Call St. Vincent's.  Oh, my God.  Here we go, Garrett.  This is for you.  Is this a video show?  Here we go.  A little striptease going on here.  Nice, right?  Look at her shaking.  Ugh.  Shaking that stuff.  Ugh.  Oh, my God.  Uh, uh, okay.  Watch.  Okay.  Here we go.  Uh-oh.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think she's going-  Oh, my God.  Look, she's doing all her old moves that were good in, like, 1952.  Oh, she's teasing the hell out of me, bro. 
[02:02:00]  Tease, tease, tease, tease.  Don't touch them.  Don't touch them.  Don't touch them.  No, don't touch Garrett.  Tease, tease, tease.  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go for the money shot.  Trust me.  Oh, my God.  I see something.  Okay.  No, you don't.  Ladies and gentlemen.  She is down.  She's jumping up and down.  Ladies and gentlemen.  They're apparently real.  And I think they're, like, 38, maybe.  34 double D.  34 double D.  That's all right with me.  That's more than a mouthful.  Without the nipples. 
[02:02:30]  Sandy, don't jump around like that.  You're going to pop a hip.  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  What type of talk is that?  Well, yeah.  Frat's a lady, man.  I'm talking because she's not a kid anymore.  And she could hurt herself.  She's quite a pistol.  The only stripper that needs a life call.  Very good shape.  When I was stripping and fell down, I was in pain.  Thank God my son, Michael, gave me the life call pendant.  For those of you who have a video with your radio thing.  Yeah.  Can we do a little of that? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Turn to 103.5.  Oh, yeah?  And you'll see the video for all of this.  Plug another station.  We don't get it.  Okay.  Turn to 1 million.93.  We're on a 103.5 somewhere.  Somewhere.  It doesn't matter.  Somewhere in this country.  Is that a station like that?  I'll take it back.  Don't turn that.  All right.  Okay.  Turn to www.meatbag.com.  Turn to www.meatbag.meatbag.com.  Just a bag with meat in it. 
[02:03:30]  Beautiful.  So should we get to the George Harrison song?  Ladies and gentlemen, they're in the scatology here.  I mean, it's deluxe.  Okay.  Oh, yeah?  You like that?  The woman has a preparation H here.  You want to apply some to her hemorrhoid, Garrett?  I agree.  I don't.  Preparation H to positive.  No, I'll leave that for you, bro.  No, she kind of likes it.  No, no, no.  Well, then I leave it to you.  I do.  You know what I mean?  I like when a man does that for me.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thought I was going to come in here and talk about a movie called  Jackpot.  Oh, no.  I don't know. 
[02:04:00]  There's the plug.  I was wondering.  I didn't know I was going to talk about hemorrhoidal situations and preparation H situations  and I didn't know.  I thought I was going to come to Jackpot.  Right.  Hello.  You know, Jackpot, which is not talking about Las Vegas.  Yeah.  What's Jackpot all about, Gary Moore?  Well, Jackpot, that's funny you should ask.  I was wondering.  It is a movie.  Okay.  Now, what's your name again?  Sandy Kane.  It doesn't have Sandy in it, although I think we would rethink that had we seen her before. 
[02:04:30]  Because it is a weird kind of a movie.  And I think Sandy sort of belongs in a movie we call weird, would you say?  Do you have the part of the spazabra available?  Huh?  But Jackpot is about the movie that I just made with this guy, Jonathan Grice.  Uh-huh.  He used to be my engineer.  And Martin, I did a thing called Martin a long time ago.  You probably don't remember that.  Sure.  Martin.  It's a black show.  You guys probably don't look at.  I love watching Martin. 
[02:05:00]  On WB.  You probably just look at ABC and NBC TV.  Martin, what's up?  Okay.  Of course.  What's up?  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you dig it.  And then a guy came five years later and claims he created what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up.  Who said that?  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up.  So I said, what's that?  He said, well, it just developed.  I said, what happened to Martin?  Oh, like the Budweiser guys, you mean?  Yeah, he said, what's up?  What's up?  He didn't discover that.  Are you saying Martin invented what's up?  Hello? 
[02:05:30]  What's up?  Yeah.  Mr. Morris is saying that.  No one said what's up before Martin.  It wasn't in the English language.  Everyone's ripping off Martin.  It wasn't in English language.  It wasn't in English language.  But jackpot, jackpot, jackpot, jackpot.  Get that back to jackpot.  Ladies and gentlemen, come Friday, jackpot is going to jump out of the pot.  Jackpot.  Yes, we're going to have a premiere.  You're right, Mr. Morris.  That commercial stole from Martin.  And, and, and, and, and, and your favorite, Daryl Hannah, is going to be in it. 
[02:06:00]  I don't like Daryl Hannah.  Okay, your favorite.  Oh, yeah.  Your favorite, Peg Lipton.  No, I'm cheating.  Peg Lipton.  Hello, you, you all right?  You all right with me?  From the mob squad.  She was banging Quincy Jones.  Yeah, she certainly was.  Well, I'm not in the woman's sex life.  I'm just talking about it in the movie.  Yeah.  Is Chevy Chase in it?  He's, you know, he's in a lot of those.  Oh, let me see.  I didn't, I didn't check this.  I got to check.  See if he's in it.  Who else in a minute, Mr. Morris?  Oh, well, yours truly, Jonathan, Daryl Hannah, Crystal Bernard. 
[02:06:30]  Now, Crystal is all right, right?  I mean, Crystal is a...  I wonder if Quincy Jones' glasses got all messed up when he was banging Peggy Lipton like  they were in the We of the World video.  You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is called trying to fight against odds that are not  not just, just, just, you know, unconquerable, but just trying to just get up out of a pile  of, did you believe that?  You're going to believe that?  Yeah, we could get that. 
[02:07:00]  You get your head up out of this pile of animal manure.  All right?  I understand.  Of animal manure.  Right.  All right?  And get your head up just to say, jackpot.  Jackpot.  Jackpot, yes.  It premieres Friday.  It premieres Friday, yes.  So, anyway.  Is this Gary Morris or Bill Cosby on crack?  Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, lady.  Now, now, now, you see, he shows, he shows, he shows that he ain't right. 
[02:07:30]  Why didn't he say, um, I don't know, George, uh, Mr. Morris, I didn't do that.  Yeah, he said Bill Cosby, because he's black.  See?  He's better off rolling.  And Magic Johnson threw barbed wire and then hugging him.  Another black guy.  You know what I mean?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, you've got to explain what's going on.  That's a great lie.  I'm sorry.  He's running Sandy.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead.  I can't even hear what's going on.  All right.  Well, Gary Morris is, uh, hugging Sandy Kane.  Yeah.  And Jim said... 
[02:08:00]  I'll wait till the music stops.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Like them.  Say, pray, Lord, pray, Lord.  They once were a mission one.  But now they've been found.  and they were lost, but now they're at sea. 
[02:08:30]  No, no.  Thank you, Lord.  Play a song like Decaptown Lady.  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  What the hell was that?  I think Chico Squelett took one too many balls to the head.  I'm a Miss Plebeians, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a Miss Plebeians.  I'll pay you boys to build a railroad,  not jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  Miss Philistines, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:09:00]  I want you to know that I have not sinned.  No.  I have not sinned.  Tell her, brother.  Okay?  I came here in good faith, Lord have mercy.  Garrett, I got to ask you something.  And my good name has been drunk through the mud.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  You know?  And you have drunk my name through the mud.  Hey, if we can't have dice on the show, what the hell?  Garrett Morris will do.  Andrew Dice Clay?  Yes.  Oh, that's my mantra.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:09:30]  Go ahead, man.  Hey, how you doing?  Talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  How come I get banned from this show?  This is a man's show.  This is a man's show.  Go talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  How come I get banned from Saturday Night Live?  Just because I don't like you.  I don't like you.  I don't like you.  You ever seen me hunting the last 20 years or so?  Hey, Garrett.  What is that like when you get shot?  That's got to hurt, right?  In other words, nothing is sick.  No, no.  I got to know.  I don't.  I got to know. 
[02:10:00]  Don't ask that question, Mr. Morris.  Don't ask it.  What happened in that situation?  Because you heard about it, but I never heard any details afterwards.  Well, well, that, that.  Know why you never heard the details?  Why?  All right.  You don't ever want to tell me the details.  Well, you know what it is.  I have, I have spinal cord injury, bro.  You did?  The thing, uh, went through my spine.  I'm supposed to be a quadriplegic.  And you're walking.  Now, watch it.  Now laugh.  I ain't laughing.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, you are.  Why, why would I laugh at something like that? 
[02:10:30]  You want to laugh at something like that?  Because you are a student of sick comedy, and you guys laugh at anything.  And there's nothing else sacred.  That's right.  You got the, hey, there you go.  You got the horn in this thing.  Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.  I'll say Jesus Christ.  See, I think we got off on the bad, on the wrong point.  Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother.  What's the name of the lady who just died? 
[02:11:00]  Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just died.  He laughed, he laughed, he laughed.  What, is that?  Okay, I'll tell you.  Okay, uh, Martha Washington.  See, that's not funny.  You got...  What about Mother Luther King?  See?  Mother Luther King?  Mother Luther King?  See, here's...  The thing is...  What?  What?  You're a legend in the comedy...  No, I'm...  No, you are.  No, no, no.  And you were injured, so he wanted to ask it. 
[02:11:30]  No, you ain't setting me up for nothing, okay?  I am the least one in this line, okay?  Gary, I...  I ain't no legend in my own mind.  I ain't nothing but just a common-American black boy trying to make a living in this man's  world.  You know what I mean?  Gary, seriously.  And y'all just big old black people, yeah, that's all you did.  What?  What?  What?  What?  As a former Saturday Night Live cast member...  Jess, Jess?  I was talking to you outside.  I told you you were in my prayers.  Like, that really was, like, big news and shook a lot of people up.  And I really, honestly, I know these guys real well. 
[02:12:00]  You told me I was your parent.  What?  You said?  I was your parent.  What?  You said I was your what?  I said you were in my prayers when I found out you got shot.  Hey, man.  So I'm telling you...  He sure did.  He sure did.  He prayed to Satan.  I'm telling you, I know these two guys well enough that if he's asking you about what happened,  it's because he's concerned also.  I really wanted to know because I never got any knowledge on that.  I just told him.  And if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.  Did you know the guys?  Were they, like, gangbangers?  Was it, like, just a random thing?  Did I know the guys who shot me?  Hell no.  Jim, shut up and stop pretending you're a kiss-ass. 
[02:12:30]  These guys, this was a guy and a girl.  You're like Norris sitting here.  This was a guy and a girl.  All right, here it comes.  Phone call.  Phone call pending.  No, I didn't know these people.  I've been going around South Central for, like, 12, 13 years before that happened.  That's where you're from?  No, no, I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana.  But I happen to be living in L.A.  But why does a man with a lot of money, like, live in South Central Los Angeles?  That's a good question, Jim.  Does he go to USC or something?  I don't understand.  That'd be something you'd ask about in a relationship to that. 
[02:13:00]  Okay?  That's your problem, not mine.  That's your problem, not mine, bro.  I don't have any problems.  It's not a question I would ask is what I'm saying.  You know, but I don't live in South Central.  I live in Burbank.  Okay.  But I would live in South Central if I wanted to.  It had no problem to do with it.  Hey, man, I'm on your side.  I'm just saying.  And I'm not on your side.  I'm on your side.  I'm answering you correctly, bro.  Thank you, sir.  And that is that where I live has to do with only how I feel inside and not the amount of money I have. 
[02:13:30]  I'm not questioning.  I know you're not.  You're being sensitive.  I'm simply answering all the ramifications of your question.  You are being very pure.  I applaud you.  Hey, everything's cool.  I'm not putting you down.  But I still repeat.  No relationship to my money or whatever money I might have.  You're going to be bleeping out all of this, right?  No.  It had no relationship to the money.  And the reason why I answered that is because your boy was living there.  I ask you.  Why are you so sensitive about it, though, Garrett?  I ask you.  Why are you so sensitive?  Who says it?  Because I said it.  Oh, it's him. 
[02:14:00]  I didn't say nothing.  I'm blaming you.  No, it's him.  All you white guys sound alike to me.  Okay.  We all sound alike.  Garrett, I think the prevailing question, to be more blunt with my point is,  like, I act like you, and I, like, I'm not really going to go to an ATM in South Central  because it's probably not the safest place to go to an ATM.  That's not right.  That's not you thinking wrong.  How am I thinking wrong?  Hey.  You're going to tell me.  First place, you put me and you in the same thing.  If I go to an ATM in South Central, it ain't unsafe for me. 
[02:14:30]  You got shot.  It might.  It might be.  You got shot.  No, no, no.  People get shot in Westwood.  All right?  But not you.  Yeah, but you didn't question her.  Why do you go to Westwood?  You just said to an Asian girl, why did you go to Westwood to get shot?  Okay?  All I'm saying is, I don't question it.  Nobody else has a right to.  Period.  All right?  Okay.  Now, look.  I've been going, I've been, I've been going.  Yeah, by a black guy named O.J.  That's who they got stabbed by.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Look, if I go and do a movie, do a thing called Hunter, right? 
[02:15:00]  Which is when I came here.  And I look for somebody to Marcel my hair.  Where do you think I'm going to go?  Beverly Hills?  To get my hair cut?  No.  That's true.  If I want some good, some good crawfish, right?  Where do you think I'm going?  Beverly Hills?  No, you're going to go to West Angeles Church.  Hell yeah.  I'm going to.  You're going to go to Stevie's Soul Food.  Right down there on.  Let me answer you.  I'm going to go to my favorite seafood place in South Central.  Okay.  All right?  So by the time I got shot, I'd been going around there for at least 14 years. 
[02:15:30]  So, no, it's not unsafe, son.  All right?  I digress.  And I defer to Mr. Morris' wonderful word.  Well, well, well, I have to.  I am correct.  Thank you.  I'm not trying to correct you because you're a beautiful guy.  But you have to be in the way of the bullets.  So a few hits you.  But I don't mean to put you down, okay?  No, I'm serious.  I don't mean to put you down at all.  No, no.  But I'm asking to people out there who might also say, I can't go to South Central because 
[02:16:00]  it's dangerous.  All right?  Everywhere you go, you get shot.  Excuse me.  Okay?  So to say, look, there's a high crime rate in Hollywood.  Right now.  Hollywood.  It doesn't match South Central, but it's high.  All right?  And Van Nuys has a high crime rate.  Absolutely.  All right?  You know why?  Mexicans.  Oh.  It's not the black people.  It's not the black people.  It's the Mexicans.  We can all hate the Mexicans.  Attention. 
[02:16:30]  I don't want to speak against my people, my friends.  You're strong, man.  Gary Moore is strong.  Man, is this a setup?  No.  No, it ain't a setup.  So, Gary, what's the...  Now, let me say something real.  What's the jackpot about?  Let me say something real.  What's your name again, bro?  Billy James.  I'm Anthony.  That's Opie.  That's Jay Moore.  Wait.  Is it Opie and Opie and Andy? 
[02:17:00]  It's...  Opening and A...  Now, why'd you call...  Was this like...  Anthony.  It's Anthony.  It just happened to me.  So, it's nothing to do with Andy...  Nah.  It's a show.  Why aren't there Mayberry artifacts around this thing?  Well, you know.  Nah, there's no Mayberry stuff.  But I want to...  Look, I want to thank you guys.  I'm serious, okay?  I really want to thank you guys for having me here, okay?  No problem, man.  All right.  But no, not everybody's doing it.  Conan said no.  Really?  Yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[02:17:30]  That son of a bitch, huh?  What are you working on?  I guess he knows that.  Well, fancy you should ask.  Besides Jackpot, I got a sitcom I'm working on that's called Bourbon Street.  It's a jazz sitcom.  I'm from New Orleans, and I'm trying to hook up something that's...  All right.  Let's all sing one of the songs I think can bring everyone together that Garrett made famous  back on SNL.  I'm gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see.  I'm gonna get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see. 
[02:18:00]  I see, wait a minute, see.  Wait a minute.  That one without rules.  Woo!  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know I love white people, okay?  They're all right with me.  Of course.  Okay?  What do you all right with me?  I did happen to write that song, and that's true.  You know?  It's a legendary bitch.  But I have nothing against white people.  So, particularly white ladies, please don't get turned up by the song, okay? 
[02:18:30]  All right.  All right.  Hey, Garrett, we're gonna say thank you.  And good luck with Jackpot.  Yeah.  The Jackpot?  Thank you, man.  When is that coming out?  Friday will open up here, and tomorrow it opens up in Los Angeles.  And my man, Jonathan, is doing a fabulous job, man.  I mean, a lot of people underestimate who's...  This is my...  What?  The great Garrett Morris, Anthony.  Oh, okay, Garrett Morris.  He was in...  You remember Martin?  I'll tell you, but he was...  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  We talked about the Mars.  He did it in the day, and he also played the computer exploit in Pretendant. 
[02:19:00]  Jackpot opening Friday against Planet of the Apes.  That shouldn't be that bad of a hit.  Right?  Whoa, right.  Planet of the Apes opening up Friday.  A little competition never hurt, right?  So, not like anyone wants to see that movie.  Garrett, that's...  Did you see...  What's the guy's name?  The big guy...  Planet of the Apes opening up in the Magic Johnson theaters.  Did you see Michael Clark Duncan?  Yeah.  The advertiser literally looks like Michael Clark Duncan in an Apes. 
[02:19:30]  I guess no.  Anthony would say something.  What did you say?  That's no Anthony.  Wait, hold it.  I was talking to Jay Moore.  What did you say?  I didn't see him after.  What did Opie just say?  That got me screwed.  I have no idea.  Anthony said the Planet of the Apes is going to be in Magic Johnson theaters.  No.  Opie said that.  Dude, I was talking to goddamn Jay Moore.  I was just talking to Opie about the...  I don't even know who Opie is.  So, what the...  You know...  I'm being screwed here.  You know, if I say something inappropriate, I'll take the blame. 
[02:20:00]  The great Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone.  Great Garrett Morris.  There we go.  Garrett Morris.  Feel the love.  Feel the love.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone.

[02:22:30]  The great Garrett Morris, Anthony.  Wow.  He hugged everybody, though,  on the way out.  Yes, he did.  Feel the love.  Feel the love.  Him and Sandy Kane,  it looked like Patrick Ewing  at a strip club.  What the hell strip club is that?  What?  What the hell strip club is that  that has girls like...  What is a strip club?  It's in the paper.  Not girls like Sandy Kane.  Yeah, you don't get that...  Hey, Dion Warwick getting Hummer.  Patrick's like,  you know what? 
[02:23:00]  They said he was nervous  on the stand today.  Yeah, maybe it's because  he doesn't speak English.  Oh.  Maybe it's because  he doesn't want anyone to know.  And then he said,  oh, then everyone stood around  and watched the club owner  and all his friends.  Yeah, you know why?  Because they can't believe  you're in a strip club  getting a Hummer  and you're still wearing  those stupid fake reading glasses.  Why don't you loosen the tie,  take off the fake  union representative  fake reading glasses, Patrick.  Like you can read  the shot clock,  let alone... 
[02:23:30]  Oh, man.  Let alone...  All right.  Where's Brother Joe?  Oh, my God.  But it wasn't like  nothing happened  because I didn't pay for it.  Oh, I thought  you were married  with kids, idiot.  Why don't you go back  to the Pacific Northwest  with the Sonics  and go back  to scaring campers?  Jay Moore  appearing at the Improv  somewhere soon.  More sports coming soon.  More sports coming soon.  M-O-H-R sports coming soon. 
[02:24:00]  When is Garrett Morris'  film coming out?  Tomorrow.  No, I don't know.  Friday, maybe.  Or tomorrow  and then Friday.  I won't be able to see it.  Why is that, Jim Norton?  Oh, because I'll be  at the Stress Factory  Thursday the 26th  through Saturday.  Is that a B room?  What's that?  Is that a B room?  Oh, man.  Just had to let it lay there.  No, Thursday, Friday  and Saturday  I will be there.  7-3-2  Just let it lay there.  5-4-5 
[02:24:30]  4-2-4-2  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Vinnie should be  emasculated  for that phone number.  That really annoys me.  Can we play  Brother Joe's song  and then we got  man boob guys outside.  Yeah, what a...  It's not even played.  Joe's here live.  Oh, yeah, I know.  To perform a hot off the presses.  Of course, along with you, Anthony.  A George Harrison song.  I might be late on the way to bar nine tonight  because I'm going to watch, again, the Ewing press conference  to see if they show any Bigfoot footage.  I have an alibi. 
[02:25:00]  Look, I was scaring campers.  That is so wrong.  Ewing and the Hendersons.  Oh, yeah!  Fantastic!  Oh, my God.  Oh, John Lithgow, Patrick.  I'm not going to be able to sing this, man.  No, no, you're going to sing it.  It's too good a song to not sing.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm going to turn off most of the mics  and let Brother Joe perform.  What have we got?  We have a couple of them on.  These guys are going to help. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, grab that one.  We're very relieved that George Harrison's going to be okay.  He's very pissed off that people are reporting he's going to die soon.  Well, I don't think he's going to be okay.  I don't think Joe does either.  Oh, no? You don't think so?  No, he's sitting there like Catherine Ann Quinlan  or anything.  No.  All right, here we go.  Do you know I can't conceal how crappy cancer makes me feel?  real soon. I know I'll be dead real soon. I know I'll be dead real soon. I know I'll 
[02:26:00]  be dead real soon. You know I can't conceal how crappy cancer makes me feel. The doc says  it'll be terrible. Before I croak, I'll be a vegetable. You know I'll be dead real soon.  You know I'll be dead real soon. You know I'll be dead real soon. You know I'll be dead  real soon. It started with a little pain. I thought my neck was sprained. Ouch, me head

[02:27:00]  dead real soon. You know I'll be dead real soon. I know the guy's dead real soon. You know I'll  be dead real soon. You know I'll be dead real soon. There you go. Thank you. Okay, terrific.  That's right. Bar 9. Tonight. Between 53rd and 54th. With a whole bunch of guests. Maybe 
[02:27:30]  I'll go over there with my fake beard wife that I hide my homosexuality behind. Maybe I'll  bring the wife up to Bar 9. That's very strange because we haven't talked about that in eight  months. Well, me being gay? Yeah. We dropped that a long time ago. Yeah, it kind of went  away. Why can't you? I'll just get you to the punch. You know, I'm glad to hear that.  Hey, here come the reviews already. Wow. Oh, great. All right. Chris, what's up? Hey,  what's going on? Dude, man. That song went too far, man. What's the matter? Dude, the guy's 
[02:28:00]  a Beatle, dude. I didn't think I'm far. Dude, you're being very undude. Well, I could have  gone, uh, could have gone, uh, ooh, my head. That's how it's going to be appropriate.  It's Steve Wabowski, man. I got it. Hey, um, at least it's not to the Patty Duke theme. Oh,  no. Ooh, my head. Ooh, my head. Ooh, my, too, ooh, my. My head. Ooh, my, too, ooh, my. I could have 
[02:28:30]  done that one. I'd rather hear Yoko sing. At first I thought it was a bum. Because I  hit the table with my arms. I don't know. You're the songwriter. That's horrible, man.  Poor guy. I can help. I'm not a songwriter. Hey, uh, let's get the man-boob guys in here.  Where's the man-boob? They got their pictures taken. They're up on the website. We're looking  for the guy with the worst man-boobs and, uh, the fine doctor, Dr. Gregory Pistone, P-I-S-T-O-N-E  from Philadelphia. He's got a website, drpistone.com. Wow. For full of hair, a thinner 
[02:29:00]  body, and a fresher look, see Dr. Gregory Pistone. Also sponsoring this is  goldenpalace.com. Wait, did someone just curse? He just scared Jim Laird. Look at King  Kong Bundy this guy looks like. Wow. Hold on. Hold on. Also sponsoring this is  goldenpalace.com. When you vote on the man-boobs, you'll have a chance to enter for a trip to  Hedonism 3. I'd like to step out onto the mat and shake this filthy animal's hand. Do you  get that, uh, you get that King Kong Bundy thing a lot? Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, a little  bit. I had to do a couple avalanches in my time. I used to be a bouncer. Oh, I used to 
[02:29:30]  be a bouncer? You don't say. Yeah. Sounds like Peg Bundy. That figures. He's going to  sound like someone kicking Jim Laird's ass in a second. No ass, man. You gotta know when  to be brave. You gotta be hiding behind a computer screen. Yeah, Opie. Dick. Oh, man. You totally  sold me down the river with Garrett Morris. Man, that ain't funny. What are you saying? 
[02:30:00]  I'm just looking and going, I don't even know what anyone said because I was talking to, uh,  I was talking to Jay Moore at the time. Did you guys see Belinda Carlisle's? Really  nice new rack in Playboy? No. We haven't checked that out yet. Really? They did it like 50s  pin-up style photos. Really hot stuff, man. It looks airbrushed, though, and the whole thing. I don't  care. Just the fact, they always, they bring it in. They always get, they get everyone to take  their, yeah, she's got, nice, nice, nice. Triangle going. All right, who's in the contest  today? All right, we, I guess we gotta check out more of you guys. And then we gotta bring  in Danny Connell. Uh, okay, terrific. What's your name, man? I'm Justin. Justin? Justin, 
[02:30:30]  they took your pictures for the Man Boob contest? Yeah, they took my pictures and, uh, Sandy  Kane offered to TF me with her little Mr. Dildo there, so I was kind of freaked out. Hey,  how about that? Hey, look at that. Yeah. All right, take your shirt off. Now, you, Jesus,  I'll be a fag. Now, this is, you're a guy that's, you don't weigh that much. How much  do you weigh? I weigh 145, but I dropped 20 pounds over the last couple of years. And  in the, uh, breast area, it stayed. Stayed. All right, let's take a look. What a shame.  Okay, let's look. Um, all right. Yeah, yeah, you're sporting. Those are fantastic. You're 
[02:31:00]  sporting there. He's got, like, he looks like Tracy Lords when she was 15. All right, yeah,  when he puts his arms down, too, you could really kind of see that. Wow. He's got, like,  13-year-old, uh, girl. Those are those, those budding boobs that you get from, uh, the...  Looks like the cover of the, uh, album cover. Uh, Blind Faith album. Blind Faith album cover.  The cover of Blind Faith with hair. Well, that's, that's, uh, you gotta, uh, you know what,  with jugs like that, pal, you might want to shave your chest and belly. All right, I think 
[02:31:30]  you are definitely in this. You're in the running, man. In the running. Okay. For the free  procedure from Dr. Pistone of Philadelphia. See, and here's a guy that, uh, doesn't have to,  like, lose a lot of the weight or something. Because some guys are just fat. You don't know  if you lose the weight, those things might go away on their own. Sure.  But here's a guy, he doesn't weigh that much, and he's got the boobs. All right, who's  our, uh, next guy here? I know, it's you. What's your name? He raises his hand. That'd  be me. That's good on radio. Make sure you wink a lot. What's your name, man? It's Costa. 
[02:32:00]  Costa? Yeah. All right. And how much do you weigh? You're packing a few, right? Yeah. About  two, two, two. Too plenty? Too plenty? Ha ha. Okay. You've had a, you know, you enjoy  the beer or something, right? I'm just, I'm just a food guy. Yeah, a food guy? Food. And  what's the problem with your boobs, man? Well, well, but that kind of looks like a fat guy  kind of thing. You should take off your sweater, too, so we can look at it. Sweater's off. 
[02:32:30]  It's like Sandy Cain's cavity. Ha ha ha. Look at the side view. Ha ha ha. Oh. Look at  the side view. All right, the side view. This wall-y thing going on. The side view is, uh,  more telling, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Zero. That's good. Zero. Naked Zero. I would kiss you,  but you're so damned ugly. Damn Zero. Nice, hairy cans. I love your cans.

No. I ain't going that far, man. I bet your breasts are bigger. All right. All right. Damn.  Who's? Hold on. Don't even talk like that. Hold on. Garrett Morris, uh. Nice cans. Get  in the coffin. What's your name? Ha ha ha. The guy that looks like King Kong Bundy. What's  your name? Uh, Pat. Uh, me, Thor. Val is good on the message board. Pat. What? Get in the coffin. 
[02:33:30]  What's your name? Pat. Pat. Val is good on the message board. Dan Nipiano case. I love you  and the hills have eyes. Ha ha ha. No. No, no, no. I'm still waiting. No way. No way. No way.  Norton stole the phone. I'm still laughing at getting a piano case. Ha ha ha. Die. Get  in the piano case. Die. Die. Oh, my God. Show us your man boobs, sir. You look like a cross  between Mr. Clean and a pile of crap. Ha ha ha. Die. Get in the piano case. Ha ha.

There's something going on underneath  that. Oh, boy. What's going on, man? See those cans, honey. Hello. Oh, my God. Wow. Wow. 
[02:34:30]  Wow. Those are man boobs. My man is jiggling them like a stripper.  Is that my procedure now? Wow. Yeah, that's a... That's... They hang. Those are man boobs.  Those are, like... You can flex them. He's got, like, uh, wow. They're, like, seats.  Didn't Tony Atlas used to do that flex in the WWF? That... That pectoral flex? He's got  nipples like that red-headed fat girl that was in here. When you turn sideways, it looks  just like Santa Cain's boob. Oh, my God. I swear. Turn sideways. Turn sideways. Those implants? 
[02:35:00]  Looks like Telly Savalas with a yarmulke. Ha ha ha. He's a 300-pound man with breast cancer.  That is huge. Wow. Wow. You got him on the sides. Turn around. Turn around.

Getting Hummer and strip clubs.  We have Jay Moore to thank for today. 
[02:38:00]  Jay Moore.  In the house.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  For whoever's new, it's the best C-rated celebrities and character actors.  By the way, I want to thank Jay.  And Emmett Walsh standing by.  I want to thank Jay on the air.  He gave us major props in the L.A. Times.  Yeah.  Major props.  I saw that quote.  The article's out there somewhere.  He says, it's like your friend's got a radio show.  Yeah.  You just pop in and hang out.  Pretty cool.  That's right, baby.  That's it.  Spread it around.  That's it. 
[02:38:30]  Spread it around.  I had it.  We all had it.  I went with it.  Easy come, easy go.  Oh, yeah.  Horatio.  Out of the question.  Out of the question.  Mr. Faber-Sham.  Out of the question.  Out of the...  Did you notice how we filled the room?  I did notice I got a little more crowded.  And then Ralph looks at him because he can't yell at him because he's getting flattered.  I looked to Norton like...  Also, Jim Norton, thank you. 
[02:39:00]  You still here?  He's playing somewhere.  Whichever, Long Giant?  Stress Factory.  Oh, yeah.  732.  This weekend, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  With the funny number.  Oh, ha.  Sit down for a second if you haven't been listening.  732-545-4242.  But that is ha-ha.  It's spelled ha-ha.  H-A-H-A.  545-ha-ha.  Or you can get the, you know, call that collect stuff with the guy from the Rockford Files and 
[02:39:30]  they can just tell you what the phone number is.  James Garner.  But it's so much more fun to dial in a ha-ha yourself.  Didn't you have some ass cancer or something, Jim?  He had the ass cancer, Tony.  He's still the boss.  Tony, what's happening?  Tony, get Sandy Kane out of my house.  Also, Brother Joe, of course.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He brought in some great stuff today.  Bar 9, baby.  The George Harrison song and Ed's mom singing and Joe's mom singing.  Always happy to help out.  It's like the Partridge family.  He's playing Bar 9 tonight.  Let him get his plug in.  I apologize.  And don't forget, hit Rock Cut at www.mp3 slash Rock Cut 1. 
[02:40:00]  There you go.  Always the plug step.  Patrick, do you remember that on the witness stand?  He told me, double, double.  And Cowbell Bill, of course.  Thanks for stopping by today.  Thanks, guys.  By the way, we're going to be plugging in tonight.  Yeah, yeah.  Plugging in tonight, man.  Hey, Joe, if I go to Bar 9, can we maybe get a song out there, man?  Absolutely.  Oh, sure.  All right, Jay, might I show up at Bar 9?  Everything tonight? 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, drums.  I mean, the whole show.  Do you guys want Santa Cain to show up?  No, she showed up last time.  Santa Cain shows up.  I don't know if I could say it.  You know what happens?  She sits on the couch.  You know how they got the couches kind of in front by the stage?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She sits there.  Everyone else is packed in like sardines, and all the couches are empty because no one wants  to sit on the couch.  No one wants to sit, not.  Santa Cain and Garrett Morris on the couch.  Sharing their full-blown AIDS.  Oh, God.  Speaking of, if Steven shows up tonight... 
[02:41:00]  Steven always shows up.  It's a bar.  You know what the best part about full-blown AIDS is?  Last time I was at Bar 9 to see Joe on 9th Avenue between 53rd and 54th, starting at  9 o'clock tonight.  Buy a lot of beer and tip the waitresses because they're hot and we're all trying to get laid  with them.  Right.  www.mp3 slash rockgut1.  All right, all right.  Yeah.  When Dina Kola reads the words to the second verse, you've got to watch.  His hands are shaking like Ronald Reagan's.  He is...  You'd think a comedian would be at ease on stage.  The guy is shaking like a nine-year-old girl the first time she sees a donkey's sea. 
[02:41:30]  You know how his eyebrows move?  I was going to go back to alternate when he's singing.  Yeah, it's like looking at my Rottweiler.  It's because he's doing spoken word.  Yeah.  Let's go to the phones and play.  What did we learn on the show today?  Carolyn.  Hey.  Oh, is it Carolyn or Caroline?  Caroline, Brian.  Ah, nice.  It's Caroline.  What's up, Caroline?  Brian.  Well, today I learned that today's tragedy is tomorrow's carnival ride. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, very good.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you for playing along.  Oh, I thought you had a second.  It sounded like it.  It sounded like she might have had a second.  All right.  Eric learned that Norton gets his pick of the chicks who don't blink.  Al Mack, today I learned Ann's family can drink and Opie's family can Prozac.  Jersey Gary learned a lot today.  I learned on the O&A show today, when a hot girl goes to smell her feet, you got to go  sneak a peek at her peach.  I'll get more of a laugh dialing the stress factory than seeing Norton there this weekend. 
[02:42:30]  That's hilarious.  Oh, that's good.  Is that off?  I think that's interesting off of Darkness on the Edge of Town.  And then he writes, ha, ha.  He also learned, I'd rather be trolling for pepperoni at the Provincet Pizzeria at 2 a.m.  than go home with Sandy Kane and Zwato.  That's a good callback.  Sliding down the deck of the Titanic to my icy, watery grave is actually fun.  An O&A family reunion is a Prozac-munching, alcohol-swilling affair. 
[02:43:00]  Line of the day, be aware of the bullets.  A few might hit you.  And finally, he learned Brewer on AIDS with less money and movie credits equals Jim Norton.  That guy, who's that guy?  That's strong.  That was real good.  Very good.  Good stuff, right?  Good stuff.  Good funny stuff.  He set a high standard for the other people that email in, you know.  See?  That's why we might stop right there.  Jason.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned today that it's going to take 80 damn years for me to be able to get around a  Columbine paint fallout. 
[02:43:30]  He was working on it, Opie, and I think the idea came across, but the delivery a little  weak.  Jay, I don't know what happened.  It's okay.  It's all right.  I do comedy for a living.  I'm not sure what sentence just happened.  Concord.  It was like I walked into the wrong classroom.  I was like, this is definitely nothing in my stratosphere.  I'm out of here.  This is like, I think this guy's name's Concord?  Concord.  Concord.  Yeah, what's up, player?  What's up, fellas?  I feel you, Monty.  How are you?  Go ahead, Monty.  I feel you.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Martin Lawrence invented the phrase, what's up, and Patrick Ewing speaks no English.  Right.  There you go.  He was listening.  You just learned that today.  Well, you said it.  They threw oranges at him in Cambridge.  Patrick Ewing can't read this sign.  Peace, boys.  All right.  There you have it.  Look at Phil from Philly.  I learned Conan O'Brien knows real talent.  Nice.  Opie.  Opie, see how it comes around?  I didn't think anybody heard that.  I slid down there.  I heard it, Opie.  Opie snuck into the Hall of Fame on the ballot. 
[02:44:30]  Just slipped in.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Yeah, I had that Shondra Levy hide-and-seek game, too.  Great.  I learned a character actor and a B-star makes the best goddamn radio ever.  Oh, good.  Rar, Rar, Ricky.  Ooh, that's right, Opie.  Man, we should have something to eat.  Rar, Rar, Ricky.  Yeah, everybody's a little sharp.  This is good news, man.  Good news.  Oh, everybody's sharp today.  Yeah, like a tack.  Dad from Hoboken. 
[02:45:00]  I learned playing the part of a parrot makes you a character actor.  I loved you the first time I saw you, and I always will love you, Marie.  Marie, oh, where the...  George, what's going on?  Look at my...  George, go.  Yeah, I learned that there was a Bigfoot sighting at a strip club in Atlanta.  Yes!  Oh.  Exactly how the show could wind up.  The guy didn't even get good footage because he fell off his horse with the camera. 
[02:45:30]  I hate when that happens.  Kind of shaky.  Kind of shaky.  We're out, we're outie, man.  We'll continue the party at 4-9 tonight.  Yeah, let's go, man.  Thanks to everyone, man.  We'll do it tomorrow on Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Bobby and Anthony.  Toothless, drunk, and white trash.  Ah, you got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled. 
[02:46:00]  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled.  You got drooled. </pre>
