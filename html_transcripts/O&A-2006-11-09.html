<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous, fictional account of a viral infection, introduced by a Kevin Federline voice clip.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, then discussed their voice work in *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories*, urging listeners to check out their characters on opianthony.com.  Anthony’s ongoing, and comedically frustrating, house renovation was a major topic, with much banter about his lack of furniture and planned (potentially controversial) wall decorations.  Norton’s apartment and its large windows, relating to privacy concerns, were also discussed.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the 2006 midterm elections, featuring politically charged commentary on Democratic gains, the Bush administration, and Donald Rumsfeld’s resignation.  The discussion included frank and potentially offensive remarks about torture and other political issues.  This transitioned into a segment on inappropriate children's media, specifically a disturbing ladybug song and the book "Uncle Willie's Tickles," prompting plans for a related skit.  A “Line of the Month” segment followed, showcasing funny past moments, including a comedian's heroin addiction story and various caller interactions.  The hosts discussed a planned “homeless shopping spree,” the Chris Hansen Dateline segment, a government official’s suicide after a child sex sting, and Norton's interest in chess.

The show continued with more chess discussion, Opie recounting an online game against an eight-year-old, leading to a conversation about online child interactions and false accusations.  Anthony then detailed a three-and-a-half-hour simulated flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator X, prompting listener calls sharing their own gaming experiences. A bizarre segment followed involving a phone call with Jane, a deaf friend of a frequently mocked deaf news reporter, Karen Meyer.  The conversation, relayed through a service, was largely unintelligible, punctuated by the hosts' mockery and sexually suggestive comments towards the operator.

Listener calls recounted awkward child-related situations: one caller accidentally touched a child in a restroom, another saved a child from a car and was accused of kidnapping.  Stories about a high school playing a Nazi speech before a soccer game and Axl Rose canceling a concert were also shared.  A news report about underage sex trafficking in Thailand, using Chris Hansen footage, was discussed, along with euphemisms used in the trade and a businessman caught with child pornography.

The show further explored the high cost of Thai sex work, prompting speculation about men's motives and explanations to their families.  A caller from Indiana shared a brief, unrelated anecdote about a child swimming.  Chris from D.C., detailing a Hash House Harriers trip to Thailand, led to graphic descriptions of sex tourism with underage girls.  Upcoming live shows were briefly mentioned.  More explicit calls about Thailand followed, shifting to a listener email criticizing the hosts’ mockery of the deaf community.  This resulted in a lengthy, offensive series of jokes and stereotypes about deaf people, further fueled by additional listener calls and anecdotes.  Jim Norton's appearance in *Steppin' Out* magazine was mentioned, along with a listener's mistaken belief about a bake sale.  The "homeless shopping spree" was again mentioned, alongside observations from their walk to the XM studio and interactions with homeless people.  Discussions about Howard Stern's show and financial troubles, interspersed with listener calls and host banter, concluded this segment.  An XM executive denied any impending mergers.

A segment focused on an FHM article about Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern’s negative reaction, escalating into vulgar and misogynistic/racist slurs directed at Stern and Robin Quivers.  The hosts discussed their SiriusXM stock, a brief call with an XM employee (Elo) yielded no information on Ron and Fez’s rumored firing, and their successful comedy tour contrasted with Stern’s perceived failures.  The "Daily Dump Report" highlighted potentially offensive comments, discussing FCC regulations.  A segment from "Ugly Betty" featuring a seemingly gay pre-teen prompted further tangents.  A caller revealed Howard Stern's lies about blocking guests.  The show promoted "Whip Em Out Wednesday" and concluded with banter about staff and production.

A segment revolved around Vanessa's undercover "Ugly Betty" experiment, using a fat suit and prosthetics.  The hosts made crude jokes about her appearance and the reactions she received, contrasting it with her real attractiveness.  The discussion included vulgar language and interruptions, focusing on the visual aspects and irony of the experiment.  Promotional material for the show, including Grand Theft Auto caricatures, was discussed.  Roland's birthday was celebrated with cake.  A "Line of the Day" segment, E-Rock Radio, and more listener calls continued the crude and offensive humor, along with several audio bits.

The "E-Rock Radio" segment featured a driver's aggressive, offensive outburst while driving, interspersed with comedic references to celebrities like Arsenio Hall, Gary Coleman, and the Frugal Gourmet.  Listener requests, a discussion of a previous Brad Pitt/Barbara Walters segment, and a request for the "Special Olympics song" concluded the segment, with Jason ("Nosferatu") noted as being present in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  I've got some bad news.  Right from the beginning you knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  spills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late. 
[00:00:30]  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast?  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct.  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  You've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain. 
[00:01:00]  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out.  Here we go.  O.B.  O.B.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, this is Kevin Federline.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Kevin Federline chilling with Jimmy Norton.  You can act like a man.  What the hell?  Where did that come from?  E-Rock.  E-Rock got those IDs last week.  I guess he did something for XM. 
[00:02:00]  I don't know.  Did he?  I don't know.  It's probably gangster, whatever it was.  Yeah.  It was dangerous.  But it was relevant and hip.  Yeah.  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  If you're going to check us out on the internet today, opianthony.com.  I think you know by now we're in Grand Theft Auto, the latest game for the PSP. 
[00:02:30]  We all did voice work for the game.  Voice work.  And our characters are now up on opianthony.com.  They are.  Yeah, absolutely.  You got Club Soda Kenny as a cop.  You got Foundry Music Danny up there.  You got Derek as, I don't know, like some kind of suave, like, suave.  Looks like he's right out of Miami Vice or something.  Of course.  That would fit with the game.  Then you got Eric the Gay Middle-Aged Jogger, our own E-Rock.  Yeah.  Plays a gay jogger in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories. 
[00:03:00]  Also, myself as a cop.  Myself as a sergeant.  You got Steve C. as a golfer.  Steve.  And our own Nathaniel Thann in a pink shirt.  I'm not a character in that I'm a radio voice.  Yeah.  So I didn't get a visual.  It's a little weird to see our caricatures.  You're caricatures.  Doesn't look like you, though, does it?  No, not at all.  Yeah.  Like, Thann is an old guy in a pink shirt. 
[00:03:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  So check it out for yourself on opiananthony.com.  That's silly.  Uh, well.  I can't find my PSP.  Really?  Yeah.  I've been looking around all over my house for it.  Yeah.  My house is huge.  What can I say?  Mansion.  Say it.  I was looking all over my mansion.  My mansion.  Yeah.  I just got my rug in yesterday for my, uh, my, uh, great room.  For the great room.  Oh.  It's just a pain in the ass.  Everything.  Right.  I've been there. 
[00:04:00]  How long?  How long?  Eight months?  It's been a while, right?  Eight.  Maybe longer.  Maybe nine.  I don't even know.  I have a rug.  Thank you.  A rug.  You finally got a rug?  You got stuff from the bottom up.  Why don't you just go with the wood floors?  It takes forever.  It's not a wood floor.  It's a tile floor.  Ah.  Oh.  And it's got like heating.  It's heated tile.  Why would I know?  I haven't been invited yet.  Me neither.  Yeah.  No one has.  Yeah.  I don't have any, I don't have any furniture.  I'm not like you.  I can't invite people over when I don't have furniture.  Why, man?  It's not about your place.  It's about the hang, man. 
[00:04:30]  The hang.  There wouldn't be a hang.  It would be a stand.  We would just be standing.  Well, just hand out, uh, tennis rackets and tennis balls.  We'll play tennis in your living room.  We'll play some racquetball.  We'll play some racquetball in your living room.  Some rugby.  Yeah.  Men.  Are you expecting to get invited soon, though?  Maybe we'll be invited.  No, of course not.  Maybe we'll be invited this week.  Maybe this week?  I look at my mailbox every week hoping for an invite.  Oh, for an invite?  Well, let me tell you something.  Living room furniture is coming soon.  And the second I have a living room where people can sit. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, all right.  Whatever.  Then you will all be invited over.  I'm sure we will.  Commiserate with my own mommy.  I have not invited her over.  What is wrong with you?  She hasn't seen your house?  Well, she saw it, like, when it was completely empty before I even moved in.  So she really hasn't seen it?  No.  With your personality in there?  No.  And all your, uh, Nazi stuff on the wall?  All my, uh, Nazi memorabilia.  All...  I don't have Nazi memorabilia.  She's gonna walk out of there.  Sal's gonna have to put his arm around her.  And she's gonna cry and go, why does he like the Nazis so much? 
[00:05:30]  No, Roe.  He just collects stuff.  It's okay, Roe.  As long as the checks come in, Roe.  I have a feeling we haven't been invited to Anthony's mansion because he's got stuff hanging on the walls and stuff.  And it's just too much of a hassle to hide the stuff just for an afternoon to have us over.  I wish.  So instead he comes up with all these excuses why we can't be there.  I wish.  Anthony likes boy art.  Boy art?  Like Mapplethorpe stuff.  Boy art? 
[00:06:00]  Like, uh, Pee Wee Herman?  No.  Believe me, I wish I had stuff up on the walls.  That's a whole nother thing.  You get furniture and then what?  You gotta put things on the walls.  Right, right.  And, uh, and, uh, not just curtains.  They're called window treatments.  Are they?  I have to put up window treatments.  Since when did that happen?  Where curtains or blinds all of a sudden turn into window treatments?  So they could jack the price up, uh, tenfold.  I went to the same place that did XM's, uh, those, those little things in the room. 
[00:06:30]  They took, it was good.  Oh, yeah?  Just for blinds.  I was naked.  Do you understand?  I have windows all around me.  Cool.  I was naked on my computer for six months before I had any type of shades.  And you know what an animal I am.  People could just peer in.  And anyway, there was.  Wow, there was probably.  Open seen my place.  Video, yeah.  It's surrounded by windows.  I've seen Jimmy's place a few times because he invited me.  He certainly has.  I am waiting.  And he didn't have much, uh, stuff in his place when I first went.  How about anything?  He had a couple things laying around.  But I know where, I know what he's talking about. 
[00:07:00]  He's got a, he's got a little side room that it's, uh, two of the walls are just completely,  uh, windows.  Uh, they're windows.  They're not walls.  Well, they're walls, but they're made out of whatever.  Glass, okay?  It's, it's, it's two walls made out of glass.  And that's where he sits naked on his computer.  Oh!  And how, and how his apartment sits.  He's on a low level floor and there's buildings all around him.  And you, I know he is just looking at porno on the computer and just doing what Jimmy does. 
[00:07:30]  I'm on the 10th floor.  So people looking straight out can see me, above me can see me, and people looking on  floors below.  Oh my God.  Looking up can see me under my desk.  And I finally got shades.  People are just looking like you're a monkey.  Like you're just a monkey.  Especially in the, in the night.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  The light should be out, but you could see the glow of the computer on my fat face.  My right arm looking like he was pumping air into a bike tire.  Just making horrible things to yourself.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I re, I really do want to invite everybody over. 
[00:08:00]  I want to have a really nice housewarming party.  Housewarming party.  Yeah.  When I at least have a living room done.  Can I bring a date?  Of course.  I want the living room done.  And all I have now is a carpet.  Talk to the Palatog people.  They know.  I sit, I sit on my rolling office chair in front of my computer, which is in the living  room because the office is being worked on. 
[00:08:30]  And they laugh at me and go, what's with the echo?  Because all you hear is an echo because there's nothing in the room.  Nothing.  You can't even sit in the kitchen.  There's not even like a kitchen table type thing.  There are two stools, two stools by the, um, like, uh, uh, island in the kitchen.  That's it.  I'm, I'm not into the, uh, the Palatog camera in my home, but maybe I should do mouse cam  though. 
[00:09:00]  You should do mouse cam.  That would be hilarious.  That would be funny.  Just put it on the mousetrap, leave it rolling and see if somebody can catch the mouse getting  slammed in action.  That would be awesome.  Mouse cam.  Hope he's house.  I haven't seen any mice in a while, which is good.  Good news.  Hey, uh, rummies out.  Rummy's out.  Big news.  Man.  I think we talked about this on the XM show.  How, how bad, uh, Bush effed up.  Oh, for this election to go this way for the Democrats.  Everybody just bailed.  It is now official. 
[00:09:30]  The Democrats, uh, run the house and breaking news.  Officially.  They now, uh, run the Senate.  Yep.  They're calling it.  I guess, uh, it was down in Virginia and the Democrat down there won.  So now they can, they control, uh, the Senate as well.  They're running the show, which makes, uh, Bush the lame duck.  But what'd you say?  It was so bad that they, they, uh, elected, uh, what were you saying?  I forgot.  A Muslim.  Oh, they're electing all kinds of people as long as they were Democrats.  Yeah, the, uh, in Boston, they elected, uh, uh, a black governor, a black, was it the 
[00:10:00]  governor or a lieutenant governor?  I don't know.  And then, uh, upstate New York, they, they elected, um, the old singer from the band Orleans.  Cause he was a Democrat?  Uh, I guess so.  He sang, remember, baby come back and still the one.  Yeah.  And still the one.  Yeah.  He won too, huh?  They elected him.  How bad do you have to screw up?  Oh, they're showing more gay marriages on that TV.  Yeah, we brought them better than turning around and watching men kiss on television. 
[00:10:30]  You know, you say that's sarcastic.  But yeah, Bush just screwed up.  He, he accepted.  He said, you know, uh, I'll take some of the responsibility.  Yeah.  Some?  How about all of it?  The guy screwed up.  All you really had to do after 9-11 was make the country feel safe.  Yep.  That's it.  Just make it feel safe.  It wasn't really about, uh, starting a war in Iraq or anything, regardless of what you  think about that. 
[00:11:00]  I'm not even going to get into it.  But, you know, you dump a bunch of troops into Afghanistan and Pakistan to look for the  real problems.  And, uh, I think people would have been happy.  You do things around this country to make things safer, which I think he, he was doing  and caught a lot of flack from it because a lot of the ACLU and, and, uh, civil rights  groups and stuff come out and say, well, you know, this is bad.  This, the torture stuff, the alleged torture of, uh, detainees at Guantanamo.  I think that's just the other side bashing them, uh, to try to make points. 
[00:11:30]  I think that stuff is good.  I like that right after 9-11 people were all about Rumsfeld and all about torture and  all about that stuff.  And then, uh, as the years went by, uh, people forget, they get a little complacent and, uh,  they don't want to see those things anymore.  Nothing wrong with torture though.  Let's be honest.  Nothing wrong with torture.  Nothing wrong with torture.  I can rest assured.  Let me, let me, I'm not going to say a hundred percent cause you never know what's going to  happen, but I can pretty much say my own government is not going to torture me for 
[00:12:00]  things I do.  That's just, go out on a limb.  I'll say 99%.  One percent chance cause you just never know.  You never know.  Who are they torturing?  I, I call them riffraff.  I call them, uh, riffraff.  I call them dregs.  Dregs.  They're torturing, uh, uh, terrorists to try to find out what they're up to.  What kind of shenanigans they're up to.  That's why, uh, they've, they've failed in, uh, really, uh, doing anything here on the 
[00:12:30]  level of nine 11 because we're, we're doing things, you know, and that kind of stuff I  like, but the other stuff, the whole, uh, Iraq thing, I mean, you get into this argument.  It's been done 800 times on internets, uh, on the internets and, uh, on the Google, the  Google, uh, that's just getting a little silly and out of hand.  Yeah.  If I could really put them in strong terms, that's silly and out of hand.  That's amazing. 
[00:13:00]  I don't need to listen to Sean Hannity anymore.  No.  Cause you've just nailed it.  I nailed it right there.  Silly and out of hand.  You're just brilliant.  The New York post.  Rummy had to go.  Rums felled.  Oh, and there's a picture of Bush with his hand on rum, uh, Rummy's back there.  All right.  Take it easy.  Right.  That's, that's what it looks like.  But the daily news put a bubble above Bush's head and says, don't let the door hit you  on the way out.  And they, you know, they wanted to put hit your ass on the way out.  Of course.  Cause that's the saying.  Of course.  The love of God can't have ass on the front page of a newspaper. 
[00:13:30]  Are you nuts?  The children will be affected.  Oh my God.  The, what will the children think?  But he's out.  They got some CIA guy in there now.  Some kind of puppet.  They could have Barbara Walters in there.  It doesn't matter because nothing is going to be done now.  Doesn't matter.  They did this so that they can, uh, work more closely with the now majority Democrats.  Yeah.  They got a new guy in there.  They knew he wouldn't work.  They wouldn't work with Rummy.  Yeah.  They weren't going to work with Rumsfeld.  Watch them all work together in the next two years. 
[00:14:00]  It's going to be like a happy birthday.  They're all going to work together.  Of course they are.  Our government is coming to a screeching halt for the next two years.  Stand still.  Now all, this.  That's it.  The move that Bush made here with Rumsfeld, and believe me, it wasn't Rumsfeld stepping down.  You know, I think I ought to resign.  Oh, could you stay, please?  It's, uh, they are trying to salvage the presidency in two years.  This is the first salvo in them trying to salvage a Republican president in two years. 
[00:14:30]  They have a lot of, uh, repairing to do to the party.  Yeah.  And good luck to you.  Hey, going back to, uh, you know, they were just hiring Democrats all over the place because  Bush did such a crappy job.  Yep.  Uh, Allison in New Hampshire has some info.  Allison.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Allison.  What's up, Allison?  Not too much.  I just wanted to say the, uh, Bush screwed up so bad.  The Democrats were so, they're like, anybody can run on our ticket. 
[00:15:00]  We had a communist, a declared communist running on the Democratic ticket, almost won for a  state senator representative in New Hampshire.  We almost, close, huh?  We almost elected a communist.  A commie in New Hampshire?  That's how bad it got for Bush.  Yeah, people were just so pissed off.  They were voting straight Democrat.  They had no clue who they were putting into power.  You know, it's the old blindfold.  I'm so mad at you.  I don't care.  Yeah, it didn't matter at that point.  It's just whoever it is that isn't you.  Right.  I, you know, I don't know a lot about politics. 
[00:15:30]  I try to take a peek here and there.  But, man, the swing in the House, what, 32?  32 new Democrats?  That's got to be up there as far as a record.  That was an ass-kicking.  That is an ass-kicking.  But at least Bush is admitting, you know, he's going to take some responsibility for what  happened.  Yeah, some.  Thanks.  During this election.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Last week, you told us that Secretary Rumsfeld will be staying on.  Why is the timing right now for this?  And how much does it have to do with the election results?  Right. 
[00:16:00]  No, you and Hunt and Kyle came into Oval Office, and Hunt asked me the question one week before  the campaign.  And basically, you're going to do something about Rumsfeld and the vice president.  And my answer was, you know, they're going to stay on.  And the reason why is I didn't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final  days of a campaign.  And so the only way to answer that question, and to get you on to another question, was  to give you that answer.  I was lying to you. 
[00:16:30]  That's pretty much him admitting that he lied to the press when he said that Rummy was going  to be with him until the end of his term.  Yeah.  Well, I meant it was the end of Rummy's term, which was today.  All right.  We got lots to do today.  Thanks for checking us out.  We appreciate it.  We have in front of us.  Well, we have that, too, Jimmy.  That's very exciting.  Oh, man.  Well, let's give me a plug.  If you're in the New York area, Jimmy's on the cover of Step In, Step In, Out Magazine. 
[00:17:00]  There's no G in that.  I know.  That's why I corrected myself.  Step In.  You should be on the cover of Coming Out Magazine.  Out Magazine.  Fruit.  Sixty, huh?  Yeah.  You lost count at sixty, huh?  How's it going, right?  Oof.  Wow.  No, it's a good article.  Check it out.  It's on newsstands now.  A few exclamation points I don't care for.  Yeah.  And if you're reading the article, Jimmy had nothing to do with the exclamation points.  Yeah, wherever you see exclamation points, put a period there.  I never write exclamation points unless I absolutely need it. 
[00:17:30]  Jimmy hates exclamation points for the new listeners.  And this article is just filled with them.  And it had nothing to do with Jimmy.  It had something to do with the writer.  There were more of them.  But some got taken out.  But they should have all been taken out.  Yeah, because you didn't talk.  No one talks.  You just don't talk like that.  Hey.  But Front Page is stepping out.  That's very cool.  And of course, the big show tomorrow night, right, Jimmy?  Hammerstein, yeah.  A bunch of us are all going to check out Jimmy.  Hammerstein Ballroom here in New York.  Oh, I hope my jokes are well received.  And also, I think we've got to do this right away. 
[00:18:00]  Uncle Willie's tickles.  Uncle Willie rules.  Uncle Willie tickles.  Uncle Willie's tickles.  Well, yesterday we were talking about kids' songs and how they're inappropriate.  We don't think they're inappropriate, but some do-gooder out there.  Well, that Ladybug song was a bit much.  You think?  That was a little bit much.  Let me play this really fast.  Because this led to Uncle Willie's tickles.  There was an album that was put out for kids to fall asleep to, I guess.  Little lullabies. 
[00:18:30]  Or just have fun in their little rooms with.  And a lot of parents weren't checking this out because it's a kid's record.  Yeah.  And when they finally listened to some of the words, they were a little horrific.  And one of these little children had trouble sleeping at night.  Correct.  And the parents listened to the record and realized, perhaps this was it.  Well, here's the grandma.  The do-gooder.  Yeah.  Shouldn't she just be making sauce somewhere?  But she's protecting all our children out there.  We got a call from an irate grandmother who was so upset over an innocent gift she bought  her grandson, she never thought it would affect him so badly. 
[00:19:00]  You may even own one yourself and not realize what it is.  Debbie Jurgensen is a wonderful grandmother, but she's feeling awfully guilty these days because  of a gift she gave her grandson.  To think that I gave this to him, thinking it was going to soothe him to sleep, and then  to find out that he went through four days of pure horror and was hysterical crying every  time he went in his happy little room.  And it was my doing.  Believe it or not, the gift Debbie bought was this stack of children's CDs called 101 Toddler 
[00:19:30]  Tunes.  We started playing the CDs and putting them on at night for the little guy, and he wasn't  sleeping too well.  And then my husband thought it might be the music, and I thought he was crazy.  And so one afternoon, I put it on to play with him in his room, and there was a ladybug song.  And he was right.  This is just one of the songs little Michael had been forced to listen to while he tried  to fall asleep.  Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home.  Your house is on fire and your children will burn. 
[00:20:00]  I can't believe this is what they're saying.  Your house is on fire and your children will burn.  Isn't that nice?  Isn't that nice?  That is such a cute little song.  Now that I've had a day to think about it, who comes up with this and thinks, yeah, this  is a great children's song.  Go with it.  It's just an old nursery rhyme put to music.  But when you put it in that context with the sweet little voice singing it and a little 
[00:20:30]  kid lying in his bed just listening to it.  And then we got into talking about kids' books and other kid songs and stuff.  And someone brought it to our attention.  There's a book out there called Uncle Willie's Pickles, they said.  Yeah.  But it's actually titled Uncle Willie's Tickles.  Tickles.  Can I just read the back before we go to break?  Yeah, you turn that thing over.  This is what this book is about.  Uncle Willie tickles Kyle until his insides feel like they're splitting apart. 
[00:21:00]  Aw.  Kyle loves Uncle Willie, but not those tickles.  He wants to hide when Uncle Willie visits.  He'll put spots all over his face so Uncle Willie will think he has chicken pox and leave  him alone.  All right.  Look at what Uncle Willie's got on chicken pox.  Chicken pots.  He'll tell his mom he's sick so he can stay in his room, but instead he tells her about  Uncle Willie's tickles, and then he tells Uncle Willie, too.  Ooh.  Kyle sounds like a snot-nosed tattletale. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Ungrateful nephew.  And that's what's just tickling him, right?  Uncle Willie wants to just tickle a boy.  And that's what the book's about.  Can we have, like, people playing the parts here?  I would hope so.  You want Steve to play Uncle Willie?  Yes, of course.  Why?  Jimmy, do you want to be the little boy?  I want to be Kyle.  You want to be Kyle?  Can I be Kyle?  All right.  We're going to have to figure that out because, and then we need a narrator, of course, so  we'll do that.  We'll do that.  Narrator.  All right.  We're just getting started.  It's the RNA virus, and we're spreading like Uncle Willie's tickles across America. 
[00:22:00]  Here with everyone else who's talking about, O&A, uncut and live, continuing the show on  XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:22:30]  The RNA virus spreading across America.  People are suggesting that Club Soda Kenny should be the narrator for Uncle Willie's tickles.  Ah.  He would make a good narrator.  Willie sounds fun.  Why did I eat pasta with spicy spaghetti sauce last night?  Why?  Didn't work out for you.  Huh?  You're thrown to the toilet?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Didn't work out?  Oh, my God.  I wish. 
[00:23:00]  It's like a furnace all down in this area.  Oh.  Are you percolating?  Kind of, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm making heat.  I couldn't get out of bed yesterday, man.  I was so awful when I went home.  I think it was the flu or whatever.  Oh.  Ew.  Yeah, that's right.  You were throwing up.  I would love to be on the bowl.  Right now, right?  Yeah.  I don't feel like I need to, but.  Hey, we're getting Uncle Willie's tickles together.  We got line of the month stuff we could do real fast. 
[00:23:30]  We got the hazing story.  Another freaking fraternity hazing story.  These are great.  These hazings, man.  They're just, they're just gay.  I don't know.  I don't get the whole thing.  You just don't understand.  I don't understand.  And I'm glad.  I was never privy to college.  You're proven that you're not gay by doing really gay stuff.  Yeah, that's what it is in front of all the guys that you're just going to hang out with 
[00:24:00]  all the time.  I don't understand it.  Why do you think there's so many fraternity fights?  Because you all got something over each other.  Is that what it is?  Because you did some real gay stuff to get into the fraternity, and now there's just all  that energy inside of you.  Was it supposed to be this secretive thing where you can't turn on a brother because we  have this info on you?  That seems like the only reason that would happen. 
[00:24:30]  It sounds to me like it's more proving loyalty.  Like, how can you prove your loyalty?  Well, since the thing that's most reprehensible to most guys is to do anything gay-oriented,  you have to do things that are gay-oriented, and that proves how far you're willing to  go for the brotherhood.  Yeah, I'm saying.  You know, this would make for an interesting break on the show.  Is there, like, a fraternity expert out there that maybe wrote a book or something?  Uh, well...  No, because where does it really come from?  Yeah, why would you do things like that?  I don't know.  I mean, it's a...  The paddling? 
[00:25:00]  It's about...  Yeah.  Well, the paddling is in just about every fraternity.  That's, uh...  And, like, they really wind up and smack.  I got my bottom paddled, yes.  Oh.  By a man.  While I was in my underpants.  See, that's the stuff I would...  I can't deny that.  Yes, that did happen.  It would happen in just about every fraternity.  It would...  I'd be one of those loners just walking around the campus holding my books tightly to my chest.  There was a rumor about a fraternity in my college. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, they would put the pledges in the basement.  Yeah.  And it would be pitch dark.  Like, you can't see in front of you.  You can't see your hand in front of you.  They made sure it was as dark as humanly possible, okay?  And then they would release, uh, kittens.  And the brothers weren't allowed upstairs again until all the kittens were dead.  Why would...  Why would you want to kill little kittens?  To show that you're a man.  And then the same fraternity, the rumor, it's never been proven. 
[00:26:00]  But...  And I swear to God, because I know how our listeners are.  I know how our listeners are.  They're gonna...  They're gonna say, I'm talking about my fraternity.  Absolutely not.  Uh, this fraternity, uh, the...  Pledges would have to put, like, uh, like, uh, like, wax lips on.  Wax lips.  And then they would have to do something with, uh, the brothers.  Oh, boy.  All blindfolded.  Oh, boy.  What kind of wax lips?  I don't know.  Because the wax lips that you used to buy in the store, remember the big red wax lips? 
[00:26:30]  And you'd put them on and talk a certain way?  Uh, they didn't have, like, an opening.  Maybe that fraternity was on to something, because it's just plain funny.  If you think about the visual.  They didn't have an opening, though.  It's just...  Oh, sure, they made an opening.  Oh, you think they...  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm just...  See, logistically, how that worked.  They should have almost put them in a room full of kittens, and you can't come up until all the kittens are petted. 
[00:27:00]  Aw.  Aw.  Scratched under their little chins.  One down, four to go.  Come here, you.  I hear you.  Where are you?  You.  You.  You.  All right.  Well, we got a hazing story in the news today.  This one is just terrific.  This one will make you laugh.  The gold lion in the Greek letters will soon be gone.  The Sigma Alpha Epsilon headquarters has now shut down the fraternity's UCF chapter indefinitely. 
[00:27:30]  Double secret probation.  That our board of directors is disgusted.  The decision comes after an alleged hazing incident on October 26th that was disturbing, to say the least.  In addition to three people being rushed to the hospital for severe alcohol intoxication, according to police reports, one man was wearing a pink tank top, women's underwear, and a blonde wig.  He was lying on the floor and vomited numerous times.  The things that are in that report are disturbing.  They're ridiculous.  And they are not reflective of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. 
[00:28:00]  They're not.  They're not.  There's a guy in a wig drinking.  That's not even that bad.  No, Jimmy, he was wearing panties and a pink top.  And a pink tube top.  That's all right.  They were just making him wear something stupid when he drank.  That's nothing.  A little wig.  A little wig.  Dress like a girl and go drinking.  And he was laying on the floor vomiting.  Vomiting.  Did they tell the whole story?  What do you mean?  Because a lot of times the newspapers will leave out things that may be shocking.  They'll always leave out the hot stuff. 
[00:28:30]  Maybe he was vomiting and then there were other things going on.  Who knows?  Who knows?  All right.  All 90 members of the chapter are now suspended and the pledge class is now disbanded.  The fraternity's board of directors says those who took part in the incident will have their memberships revoked.  It's also very sad because most of these young men are very promising young people.  The alleged hazing incident is just the latest of many problems the chapter has had in the past few years. 
[00:29:00]  Back in 2003, a pledge had his nose nearly severed after being duct taped and put in the back of a pickup truck, which later crashed.  Still, some university students say the punishment may be too harsh for the crime.  But the guys that I knew were great guys.  You know, you could trust them.  They were trustworthy, very friendly, very easy to get along with.  Now, it's important to point out the chapter's charter has not been revoked, so they could be allowed back on campus after several years.  Meantime, university police will continue their investigation. 
[00:29:30]  There you go.  After several years.  Yeah, there is a little detail.  The officer said the common area had a strong smell of vomit and number one.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's what it says.  Number one.  The common area.  So, perhaps while he was laying on the floor vomiting, he was, I don't know.  This is great.  The report also said the officers found a man wearing a pink tank top, women's underwear, and a blonde wig was lying on the floor and vomited several times. 
[00:30:00]  Another male was sobbing on the floor wearing a rainbow-colored wig and a diaper.  Yeah, there you go.  Does it really say that?  Yeah.  Yep.  Sobbing on the floor, rainbow wig, and a diaper.  Wow.  That's a rough one.  All right, let's say hi to Eric in Long Beach.  Eric, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  I got a story about a fraternity from College of Oneonta.  Yeah. 
[00:30:30]  They used to do what's called an elephant train.  We know the elephant walk.  We've heard about that.  Thank you.  We've all heard about the elephant walk.  Yeah.  Just use your imagination.  The pledges are nude, and they have to, yeah, do the elephant walk.  Walk like the elephants walk in the circus together.  I could trunk to tail.  I never did that, sir.  Why is Stan leaning toward a microphone?  He wants the elephant walk with you.  Stan?  No, I've just heard a couple other hearsay things.  Hearsay, of course.  It's always hearsay.  An event called the Pickle Run. 
[00:31:00]  The Pickle Run.  That's where the pledges have to transfer a pickle to one another free of hands.  Oh, yeah.  And if you are careless with it, you have to consume it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've heard about that.  We're forgetting another guy here.  It said, at first, these students wouldn't let the police into the fraternity house because  they were performing a ritual, they said. 
[00:31:30]  The police went in.  Apparently, the ritual included males dressing up like women, drinking until they had to be  hospitalized.  An incident report indicated that a male in the fraternity was spotted wearing pink fairy  wings and women's underwear and was not able to walk on his own.  Pink fairy wings.  That's just a good party.  Oh, yeah.  And how bad is it for these guys?  Now they shut the fraternity down, so they did that for nothing.  Right?  Yeah.  You went to a hospital in fairy wings and vomited for no reason, stupid.  For nothing.  Again, for needing to fit in. 
[00:32:00]  Too good.  Too good.  All right.  We'll talk about fraternities as we move forward today.  1-866-313-FREE is our phone number.  We wanted to do this yesterday, but we were just overbooked with guests.  It's line of the month.  The boys behind the scenes keep track of all the great lines on the Opie and Anthony show,  and then they compile a nice list of the best lines of the month with one winner.  The great lines.  The great lines.  The great ones.  Of course.  By the way, there's something going on Pal Talk today. 
[00:32:30]  Is Pal Talk exploding?  Are more and more people joining the Pal Talk community, Anthony?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, it's getting huge.  For the new listeners, we got cameras in here every single morning, and you can check us  out as we do our radio show.  Yeah.  And then we can check out the listeners as they listen to the show.  It's just a bizarre thing.  And then most of the time, unless we're talking about something really secret, you can look  and hear what we're talking about during the commercial breaks and stuff.  Well, I'm getting word that there's a girl on Pal Talk today.  She's getting completely nude and jumping up and down on her bed. 
[00:33:00]  All right.  Which one is she?  Which I think is going to cause a nice trend today for all the Pal Talkers checking out  the Opie and Anthony show.  Which one?  Which cam?  Blasphemy.  Oh.  Blasphemy?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I've had her cam up.  It was pretty funny.  She was putting her pants on.  She was completely nude.  And she put her pants on, so she had to kind of bend over to put her pants on, and her  butt was facing the camera.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, her dog came into the picture. 
[00:33:30]  I was like, now we're going to get a show.  So, but she pulled her up.  Old peanut butter breath.  You never know what you're going to get on the Pal Talk cameras, but it looks like we  may see a lot of girls jumping up and down on their mattresses today.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Line of the month, Than.  Help us through this.  What do we got today?  Let me throw your mic on there.  There you go.  Well, we have two honorable mentions, and then we have five finalists. 
[00:34:00]  It's a nice countdown.  We had to make some production for it.  Wow.  Because last month, there was some, there's a little.  Well, last month we did the bit, and quite frankly, it was god-awful.  Yeah.  So, it was very brave doing it again.  So, this is the last shot at it.  If it doesn't work today, then.  If this fails, we're going to be forced to have it sign its retirement.  That's right.  And its resignation will be sent in, and it will leave.  That's right.  So, what do we got there?  So, we tried to spruce it up.  So, the first one, the first honorable mention, takes place during the walkover. 
[00:34:30]  The walkover to XM.  Ooh.  Yes.  Does it need any more of a setup?  I mean, it's pretty famous.  Oh.  It's me, isn't it?  Just hit the button.  Line of the month, honorable mentions.  What is it?  Wow, that looks good, but I am not touching it.  You ate it, Andrew.  No.  It's some kind of a cinnamon cakey thing.  Oh.  Come on.  Oh.  I had to walk away. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, no.  I'm leaving.  Oh, no.  How was that line of the month, though?  Oh, dear, no, no.  It was one of the lines of the day, and it got a big laugh, so.  All right.  What's the line, though?  Oh.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, just a squish.  Heat and cake.  Yeah, well.  Oh, I earned that.  I earned that.  Of course, that's the stomping of the homeless man's cake.  We haven't seen him since then.  No.  No, we've been looking for him, because we're going to be doing a homeless shopping spree  very soon.  We're talking about that today after the show.  And we want him along. 
[00:35:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, we need to find Andrew.  We haven't talked to him since I jumped on his cake.  We've got to find him, because we want to treat him nice and take him along for the homeless  shopping spree.  What church does he hang out at?  I don't know.  Do we know which one of these sleeps on the stairs of a church?  It's got to be one of the Midtown churches, so.  Yeah.  I think it's, like, he kept pointing down the road.  I think it's Fifth Avenue in the 50s there.  St. Pat's, maybe.  No, not St. Pat's, because they're asking.  There's another one where all the homeless people, like, sleep in front of this one church.  You know, St. Pat's, they close their doors at night because they don't want the homeless 
[00:36:00]  people hanging out in the church.  You know, back in the day when we started religion, that's what it was all about.  Sanctuary.  Yeah, the churches were a place where you could go if you didn't have a roof over your  head.  But St. Pat's is so famous and so nice, they're like, no, screw that.  They closed the freaking door so the homeless people can't, you know, stay inside during  the cold winter months.  Maybe we can't really bitch about that.  Huh?  Maybe we can't really bitch about what St. Pat's is doing wrong.  Why not? 
[00:36:30]  Because maybe if they would have kept their doors closed, we wouldn't have been off for  two years.  Well, no, that was during the day, so.  Oh, okay.  Well, don't you find that kind of stupid if you're a church, you're supposed to be helping  people and you're closing your doors because you don't want the homeless inside your church  at night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't you think that's ridiculous?  I think all the churches.  Hire some freaking security and let the people sleep around.  Security.  And make sure they don't crap in the seats.  So then some people will be thrown out of church?  Huh?  Others let in, some thrown out.  No, but it's better than closing the doors. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Have some security and if you're, you know, really misbehaving, then you got to go, I  guess.  Yeah.  That's better than nothing, right?  I agree.  Because instead, what you get, you get the homeless people.  There's a church on Fifth Avenue.  It's not St.  Pat's, though.  And they hang out on the steps.  And they've set up like a box city.  Yeah.  At night, they fold up their houses in the daytime.  And then at night, they unfold them.  Right.  And it's a box city on the stairs of a church.  Yeah.  All right.  But homeless shopping spree is coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:37:30]  I think we're doing it on a Saturday this year.  And then we're playing the show on Monday.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  I think we're doing it on a Saturday.  Yeah.  Basically, the bid is it's huge every year.  We gather a whole bunch of homeless people.  The smellier, the better.  The drunker, the better.  The longer they've been homeless, the better.  Clothes pretty much rotting off their bodies.  Bodies rotting out of their clothes.  Bodies rotting out of their clothes.  Yeah.  Keith does a great job every year.  Keith the cop.  Gathering the best homeless people in the New York area. 
[00:38:00]  Great bum wrangler.  And then we get them on a bus.  There may be some alcohol involved.  I don't know.  Hey, who are we to say what they do?  They're grown men.  Right.  And then we take them to a mall.  The listeners show up by the thousands, by the way.  Last year, we did it on XM exclusively.  And we still had close to 1,000 people show up, didn't we?  Yeah.  And this year, if we do it on a weekend, and now that we're back on regular radio here  in New York, it's going to be ridiculous.  There's going to be thousands of people.  A lot of people.  And we usually go to one of these hoity-toity malls where they all just have their noses 
[00:38:30]  in the air.  And we just take over the mall for the afternoon.  It's going to be great.  And a lot of the listeners that show up buy the homeless guys' things, even though we  give them money.  Right.  And they buy.  Because a lot of the times, the homeless guys, we give them money, and they end up at  like the, I don't know, the Chili's bar or something like that, drinking their money  away.  So the listeners are nice and buy them things like sneakers and coats.  But they go back out on the streets with just bags and bags of brand new stuff. 
[00:39:00]  Brand new stuff.  So then they get rolled within the next week by the stronger of the homeless people.  It's like the plains of the Serengeti.  It really is.  It's just terrific.  But Steve should get a promo on the air immediately.  More details coming.  The homeless shopping spree on the way.  All right.  Back to the line of the month there, Stan.  Yes.  Another honorable mention.  This is, we had a didgeridoo player.  Oh, yeah.  In the XM studio.  Of course we did.  All right.  By the way, the cake stomping is on YouTube if you want to check it out. 
[00:39:30]  I'm ready to hear the sounds coming out of an Amish schoolhouse.  But that's, oh, Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Very well.  Competition's over at 1020 today.  Yeah.  It was topical.  It was a little dated, but yeah, still.  It was topical.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  Frank the Fronauter just did not like the sounds coming from that dumb instrument.  I actually said that before the massacre in the schoolhouse, too, which is why it was  such a good one. 
[00:40:00]  I just like the sounds of Amish teaching.  All right.  What else we got here?  And now here's the official countdown begins with an even more exciting piece of production  from Steve.  This is one of our comedian guests talking about the lows he hit during his heroin addiction.  And we'll hear that after we take a break.  Oh, wow.  What a tease.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now. 
[00:40:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  We're in the middle of line of the month.  Yes.  This is our second shot at this bit.  We'll see how it works today.  We're up to what?  The top five there, Sam?  That is correct.  All right.  Why don't you give the set up once again that you did before the break?  This is one of the comedian friends of the show talking about the lows he sank to during  his heroin addiction. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Opie and Anthony's top five wines of the month begins now.  Number five.  Ah, there you go.  Okay.  So he was selling his manhood.  Yeah.  And, uh.  Yeah, I was real bad at giving, uh.  Well, there's really no way to say that.  All I ever heard was, get up, I'll do you.  You're worse than my wife.  An actual story.  You're worse than my wife.  Is that your friend? 
[00:41:30]  Nick Shapiro.  Oh, my God.  That was funny.  I forgot about that.  That's terrific.  That was the fifth best line of the month?  Yes.  All right.  Moving on to number four.  Next up, uh, this is the, uh, you guys were talking to an overweight female caller.  Okay.  Fat broad.  Yeah.  All right.  Number four.  When your husband goes food shopping and puts the groceries away, does he have to  hire a rodeo clown to distract you? 
[00:42:00]  No, he makes me fall and put coffee.  And the stupid fatty, like, tries to answer the question.  No.  Does he really doesn't?  What an idiot.  He didn't want to know the answer, lady.  Yeah.  That's very good.  All right.  We're up to number three.  Yes.  Lines of the month for October.  Even though it's, what, we're in the middle of November now.  Slow behind, huh?  All right.  Um, this is when, uh, you guys were playing Picking Up Girls Made Easy from the seventies. 
[00:42:30]  That sort of documentary on how to pick up girls.  Yeah.  Groovy.  Number three.  Oh, so he's just getting, trying to get some, he's trying to get some action.  All right.  That's why he's, but the way he complimented her hair out of nowhere.  This is when, in 75, when, when, when a, when a condom was just, he was uncircumcised.  He's uncircumcised.  Oh.  Please.  Very good.  All right.  We're up to what?  Number two.  Number two.  Line of the month for October. 
[00:43:00]  Yes.  This is when we, uh, had just learned that, um, Master Poe, our security chief over at  XM, um, gets amorous behind FH Riley's.  Right.  What is FH Riley's?  Oh, it's a, uh, fine restaurant.  Yeah?  Yeah.  In Huntington?  Yeah.  Is it?  400, uh, New York Avenue?  Of course.  In Huntington Village?  My brother's restaurant?  Well, it's my restaurant too, but I, I don't even, I don't even, shh, you're a silent partner. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  I don't even clean glasses.  No.  All right.  This is, uh, the runner-up line of the month for October.  That's correct.  And it's, uh, Master Poe, and we found that he does stuff behind the restaurant.  Right?  Okay.  Number two.  Yeah, Poe.  The FH doesn't mean f*** here.  Don't you date it!  Don't you date it!  Anthony, runner-up line of the month for October.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  Very good.  Well, there were rumors that his, uh, his car was a-rockin' in the, in the back of FH Riley's.  Allegations.  Allegations.  We don't know.  Cheaper than a motel, gentlemen.  Um, yeah, and the, next up is the winner.  Wow.  Line of the month.  Where's the fanfare?  Well, Steve does the fanfare.  Hopefully Steve does it.  All right, here is the line of the month for October.  Yes, then.  Uh, just so you know what, uh, talking about, you guys are talking about children with Tourettes. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  And the number one line of the month from the O.P. and Anthony show.  You go to, you know, all the other guys have their kids playing T-ball.  Look at my son.  Oh, boy.  Hit a base hit.  Really?  Mine's over there yelling the C word, eating dirt.  And there you have it.  Yeah, that was a good one.  All right.  The bit's a little better.  A little smoother.  A little smoother than last month.  I like it with the production.  It's a countdown-based thing. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  You gotta do it right at the beginning of the month, though.  This way we don't lose the focus of where the lines came from.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, well, all right.  We're on to something.  Next month it'll be even better.  All right.  All right, moving on to other things.  Well, Chris Hansen is doing the whole Thailand sex trade thing.  We got Uncle Willie's tickles.  We're getting that together still.  Chris Hansen, they're kind of tying that whole dateline thing into a suicide that happened.  He says that they're not connected or something?  Well, the guy never went to the house, but the perverted justice. 
[00:45:30]  Can you explain the story?  Because I don't even really know.  Yeah, there's some government official.  I'm not sure of his exact title.  But, you know, he was involved in the public eye.  And apparently he had gotten caught up in a sting operation with perverted justice, who works with Dateline during those pedophile exposures.  Yeah, Dateline uses perverted justice.  Yeah.  They're separate entities that work together. 
[00:46:00]  But they were setting him up to come to one of the houses.  Okay.  So they were using perverted justice to communicate with this guy online as a child to have him show up at the Dateline house with all the cameras.  Apparently, the guy wasn't going to show up at the house.  He was a little gun shy.  But now this is something I didn't know, and I don't think anybody else knows.  Even if you don't show up at the house, they're coming to get you. 
[00:46:30]  They're coming to get you.  And I guess he said enough online that led the police to believe that he was going to attempt to meet with one of these people at some point.  Now, the last thing I want to do is, like, you know, defend these perverts.  Yeah.  But how is that legal?  Because you're not officially talking to an underage kid.  Yeah.  I'm not sure how far this guy went, if it went to phone conversations.  Phone conversations with a fake underage person.  Yeah.  What kind of photos he sent?  You know what?  He may have sent photos. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  It could have been sending pictures.  I'm not sure either.  It could have been whoever's on the phone, even though they're of age, saying that they are a kid.  And then this guy.  But that's the only part I don't understand.  You know, go after these guys, of course.  Lock them up, of course.  Do what you have to do.  But it just doesn't seem legal if the guy officially is not having a conversation with an underage person.  It's got something to do with intent.  Because it's like that with drugs, too.  Like, I don't know the exact law.  But if you are selling soap as drugs, you're still going to get busted for drugs.  You're still going to get busted for drugs. 
[00:47:30]  And you're going to go to jail for selling soap.  I don't know.  But they can still bust you.  I mean, if you go to buy from a federal agent, and it's like, really, you say it's a baby powder.  Right, right.  You meant to buy cocaine, but it was like baby powder.  You can't argue, well, it was baby powder I was buying.  Yeah.  Because I thought you were buying cocaine.  So if you think, if the intent is there that you're going to go to have sex with an underage person, then they can bust you for it.  So this guy apparently had done enough where they were serving the warrant, and they were going to arrest him.  And they heard a pop from upstairs, and there he was, dead. 
[00:48:00]  So they came to his house.  Yeah, yeah.  They went to his house to serve a warrant.  Dateline wasn't there at that time or anything.  Yeah, yeah.  But I guess the information they had gotten was part of that Dateline perverted justice thing where they wanted this guy to show up at the house.  He just never showed up.  Right, right.  So they're kind of peripherally involved.  I guess FARC.com put something up there like Dateline kills its first pedophile.  That's great.  Good.  Pretty funny. 
[00:48:30]  The more they're going to do that, the better.  Yeah, go ahead.  Guy just talking saucy, though.  I don't know why you're all...  A little saucy.  Don't get your panties in a bunch, fella.  You were just having a little saucy talk.  People don't seem to understand, you cannot talk with underage people on the internet.  Yes, you can.  You really can't.  It's fun.  You will get in such trouble.  I'm Uncle Willie, 555.  I like to talk.  My catchphrase is coochie coo.  And I put the link with the wink.  Coochie coo.  I told you the story on AOL. 
[00:49:00]  I got into playing chess online for like five minutes.  I thought it...  Yep.  I was thinking maybe I could be a chess champion.  I played Norton once and he humored me.  He kicked my ass.  Oh, really?  Online?  Yeah, but...  No, not online.  No, we played in person, but...  I was going to say, Jesus, you too.  I used to play back in the day when I was like 12, 13.  I thought I was...  Ooh.  I got into some tournaments and stuff.  Uncle Willie, too.  I was just getting into it.  I mean, Jimmy actually reads chess books.  Uncle Willie plays hide the bishop.  A little known fact about Jim Norton. 
[00:49:30]  He actually buys books about chess.  He's really into it.  I'm such a nerd.  Books about chess.  Yeah, exactly.  I love chess books.  See, I'm not even going to lay into you.  We all have our stuff.  Whenever I bring up certain things I might do or enjoy, I get crap for it.  And you buying chess books, now I could unload on that as being a little nerdy or geeky.  You'd be right.  But I won't.  See, I know what you're doing here.  It's not going to work.  He's trying to play in my chess with his Nazi-ism. 
[00:50:00]  Exactly.  It's not my Nazi-ism.  It's my game play.  And you're trying to play a nice defense when we go after you again.  Like, well, maybe we shouldn't go after him as hard this time because he didn't go after  Jimmy for playing chess.  That's right.  No.  Go after him.  It's geeky and weird.  No, it is a little geeky and weird.  I read them.  I used to play out games.  I would get, like, Bobby Fischer games and I'd play them out.  I would like, gee, what a surprise.  How does this one end?  It's in the book.  No, I would just do that and move and play them out.  And you wouldn't know how it ended?  No, I would, but I would like to watch them move. 
[00:50:30]  Some of the games...  Wait, wait.  Do you watch the chess pieces move?  No, when you...  I know how to play chess, so, like, when I'm going over move by move...  Oh, okay.  That was a little insult, by the way.  What?  I know how to play chess, so when I'm going...  No, no, no, no, no.  You're insinuating I don't know how to play and I'm stupid for even...  I actually didn't mean that.  What I meant was, like, for most people, just to play out a game wouldn't do anything.  But as I'm playing it out, I'm like, wow, that's great.  Oh, my...  That's amazing.  Oh, that's a good move.  And then I lose the game by, like, the eighth move in.  I'm like, I don't want to do that.  You can understand how great the move is?  Because I would just be like, oh, all right, well... 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, because a lot of times I'll...  I think it's called annotation.  They'll explain why they did it.  I am...  With chess, I haven't played in years and years and years.  I guess every kid has played at some point in their life.  But I am of the moment in chess.  I am one move.  That's right.  It's one move and...  I am not looking ahead.  I can't...  I cannot project that far ahead to go, I'm going to do this and then this.  He'll do this, that.  And then I'll do this.  I'm like, what do I do now? 
[00:51:30]  See, that's 99.99% of the people that play chess.  Yeah.  That's what we do.  You're in the moment.  Sometimes, sometimes.  Not...  I'll try to maybe look two moves ahead.  Maybe.  Yeah.  But Jimmy, you know, he's got...  He reads up on this stuff.  I haven't played in a long time, though.  But these guys, I love...  They play blindfold chess.  Where they'll actually...  They don't look at the board at all.  They just know the numbers.  You just call out the moves to them.  People have a board in front of them.  And you have to...  They'll go from board to board.  They'll play 20 people at a time.  And you'll call out all the moves that happen.  And they won't even look at the board.  And they'll tell you what moves to make for them without looking at the board. 
[00:52:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  They're brilliant.  They're brilliant.  Is that brilliant?  Or is it idiot savant?  No, it's brilliant.  Are they brilliant in other things?  Kasparov.  Gary Kasparov.  I don't like the idea that they're brilliant.  Yes.  Because they can play a stupid game.  Gary Kasparov played...  He lost finally.  I think it was deep blue.  He played the first time.  I think it was 100 million calculations a second.  And he beat the crap out of it.  And the second time...  Did he say you were pawned?  He just smacked him.  And the second time it beat him. 
[00:52:30]  Local joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it was 200 million calculations a second it took to beat him.  Wow.  So it gets back to perverted justice and all that.  I mean, very loosely.  I got into the chess.  And AOL at the time...  This goes back, I don't know, five or six years now.  And I started playing chess online.  And I was in the beginner room.  And then I moved up to the next room.  And you could go all the way up to the master's room or something like that.  So I'm a little better than the beginner rooms.  Yeah.  And I'm doing really well.  And I'm just kicking this person's ass one afternoon. 
[00:53:00]  And I'm feeling good about my chess.  And you could IM, right?  And the kid goes, wow, you're real good.  How old are you?  I'm eight.  He was eight?  And I can admit that I'm, you know, 28 years old.  Of course.  And well, you shouldn't.  So I admitted to being like 13.  And then I felt like such a creep that I was having an IM conversation with a kid.  You were trying to play chess. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  And I'm like, well, got to go.  And I got paranoid.  And I was like, you know, you don't want any interaction whatsoever.  Nope.  With kids online.  Even though you're playing this innocent game of chess.  But I really felt like I was playing, you know, maybe some dude in his early 30s or something.  Turned out it was like an eight-year-old.  Online, offline, anywhere.  No interaction with kids.  I will never be found alone with a child.  I don't care if it's an elevator or a bathroom or anything.  Walk right the hell out. 
[00:54:00]  You know what that means?  What?  You got some of those thoughts in your head.  Yeah, that I'll be thrown in prison because some kid goes, ah, something happened.  He said that.  Because you know why?  Because kids are such liars.  They're such fibbers.  Really?  That if you're, yeah.  If I ever go like into a bathroom and there's nothing but a kid in there, I'll leave the goddamn bathroom.  I actually relate to that.  Why the hell?  Because could you just imagine, imagine the kid comes running out and says something. 
[00:54:30]  He touched me.  Yeah.  But you didn't.  Like just like, oh, or oh, he was like because he heard something from a friend.  Like because a lot of times kids will say stuff that they heard or whatever from a friend or this or saw on a TV show, whatever it is.  I am not getting caught up in that.  Oh, he touched me.  And what are you going to say?  No, I didn't.  As they just shoved their elbow into the back of your neck and your face is in the carpet going, oh, no, I'm in trouble.  So that's it.  Take them out of the mix.  By the way, Dave in Boston, Anthony is busting chops about nerdy and geeky. 
[00:55:00]  Two words.  Two damage.  No, I did.  I played something even more nerdy and geeky last night.  This is the geekiest thing.  There is no real excitement in it.  There's a sense of accomplishment, but it's a game where there is.  And it takes about three and a half hours, depending on what I was.  Yeah, about three and a half.  Jimmy, get ready to look away.  It was the brand-new Microsoft Flight Simulator X that came out, and I flew a 737 from LaGuardia to Orlando Airport in real time. 
[00:55:30]  It took three and a half hours.  And, yeah, I just did that.  But I took off, and, well, you know why? 
[00:56:00]  Because you do it the actual way it's done.  You don't use anything that, like, you know, the overhead map view to steer yourself, like, to Florida.  You have to use the GPS or the VOR radials that are on the ground, things like that.  And you actually use the instruments that are on real planes, the autopilot.  And then you crank it up, you know, 35,000 feet.  And the graphics are great, so it looks really cool.  And then you figure out how everything works. 
[00:56:30]  It's amazing.  And then when you're coming in for a landing, that's the tricky part.  That's what they say.  That's the tricky part.  You do know that we're shock jocks.  It was the geek.  It really was stupid.  I'm sitting there, and three and a half hours later, I'm like, all right, I'm ready to land.  Did you have a sense of accomplishment?  Yeah, yeah, even though I hit the runway a little to the right of the runway.  Isn't it true, though, that for most of that time you're doing nothing?  Doing absolutely nothing.  Just kind of looking at the instruments? 
[00:57:00]  The autopilot really takes care of everything.  You're just dialing in altitudes and headings.  And then you hit the command, and boom, the plane.  Do you think that you could fly a plane tomorrow?  I think I could fly a plane.  I think I could fly an airline.  A commercial airline.  I know where everything is.  I know what everything does.  There is a feel that you need to the whole thing.  Landing would be very difficult.  And you've never flown a plane before.  I flew a Cessna.  Oh, you did?  Years ago.  Like, I took one of the... 
[00:57:30]  Did you take off and land?  No, no, no.  Or were you like, all right, time to take the wheel.  Yeah, it was one of those.  And you take the wheel and kind of do it.  And that was before flight simulators.  But, yeah, you know, once you know all the instrumentation and how it works, it's just the feel of it.  And landing is a whole other animal.  There's a lot involved in that.  Yeah.  Is there?  Yeah.  But it was...  Why wouldn't you hit something on purpose?  Why would you do that right?  Why wouldn't you pitch it right to the airport? 
[00:58:00]  You'd do it a couple of times.  As a matter of fact, I tried pulling that Yankee left turn into the building.  Oh, really?  Yeah, with a side wind coming.  And it is very hard to make that turn with a...  Of course it is.  ...25 mile an hour wind.  What do you get out of this?  It's actually something about aviation.  The graphics are great.  So you can look at places and landmarks and stuff like that all over the globe.  There are 25,000 airports all around the world that are really detailed.  There's air traffic control, air traffic, ground traffic. 
[00:58:30]  So you've got to interact with air traffic control.  There are missions where you actually have to obey air traffic control and go to the proper altitudes for the direction you're flying in and things like that.  And it's interesting.  Does it look like the sky's in front of you?  Yeah, it looks really cool.  Like the clouds and the weather.  You can actually set it for real-time weather.  So it checks the weather on the internet and wherever you're flying, that's the weather that you'll get. 
[00:59:00]  Ew.  So if you're...  Like I took off last night and it was raining.  What, you did it at night, bro?  Because it was raining here.  At night?  Yeah.  But then you couldn't see anything.  I know.  It's dark.  Well, it's...  I wanted to do it real-time.  You could see, like, the lights.  Very pretty.  And, you know, the moon was full.  How do you look out the side window?  They got a little view thing on the stick.  You got a little...  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  It's called a hat switch.  And it could turn around.  You can look at any portion of the flight deck and switches and knobs galore for everything.  So you know where everything is.  You need a good gaming card?  Yeah, definitely.  You really need a top-notch computer or this thing will just glitch.  And people are really, really into this.  They're, like, getting their hours up on this...  Get their hours up.  There are on...  You can actually join a virtual...  You can make a virtual airline online that you then have to carry out a certain schedule 
[01:00:00]  and keep the schedule.  And there are other people online.  You could fly in formation on these...  With stunt planes, with other people online.  There's everything from helicopters to commercial jets to stunt planes to small Cessnas.  Ew.  It's...  Ugh.  But you learn about aviation.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Watch this...  Hey, Gert!  Hey, chess book.  I'm not saying chess...  Chess book and eight-year-old online chess player. 
[01:00:30]  Whoa, what kind of graphics card do you need for a rook?  I said for, like, five minutes I got into it.  I don't know.  No offense.  It does give you a feeling of accomplishment.  And I'm getting beat up because there's a bunch of listeners out there that do exactly what  you were doing last night.  I just don't get it on any level whatsoever.  You got to be kind of a computer geek and an aviation geek.  Like, I love aviation.  Yeah.  I love the whole...  So why don't you just go for real and start flying lessons?  Because I don't want to end up inside of a building. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's just kind of...  All right.  That's a good point.  It's a little iffy.  I'd rather leave it to the pros.  Let's go to Scott in New Mexico.  Scott.  Can I ask a question?  Hey, Ed.  Yes, Scott.  I got your beat.  I've flown that thing from Kennedy to Hong Kong before.  It takes about 14 hours to get it done.  14?  But if you go to flightsim.com, I know you're not allowed to promote them, but you can download  everything from fighter jets to World War II.  Oh, yeah.  Not the aircraft.  I mean, there's all kinds of...  Yeah, there are people... 
[01:01:30]  I understand there's a community that's really into this, but Scott, you do this in real  time.  Isn't there a fast forward?  Yeah, there is.  How do you not hit the fast forward just to get a couple hours done, knowing for a couple  hours you're going to do absolutely nothing?  You can accelerate it, but the problem is if you get too many aircraft commands, it'll  cut you off your flight plan, and then it won't be any more commands.  See, if you go too fast, it's not just a straight line.  You know, when you're in a passenger plane, you're not just flying straight, especially  in weather and stuff like that. 
[01:02:00]  You've got to listen to the air traffic controllers.  You've got to adjust.  Things like that.  So that's why you don't fast forward.  You can fast forward, though.  Can you start it upside down, the plane?  Yes, you can.  I'd fly upside down and have a fun flight for everybody.  Yeah, why not?  Upside down airlines.  Yes, Scott?  If you flip the GPS switch on the dash of the aircraft, if you flip the GPS switch, you  don't even have to enter command.  It'll fly your flight plan, whether it's an IFR plan or a GPS direct route.  Yeah, yeah, the GPS really takes any work out of it. 
[01:02:30]  You've got to use the VORs.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  That makes it a little more fun.  There's a ton of people calling in.  They're into this.  How are we going to be number one in Chicago talking about this crap?  Because this is top-of-the-line stuff.  Do you know that Microsoft Flight Simulator has been one of the best-selling games since  it came out in, like, the early to mid-80s when it really sucked.  It was pretty much a line for the horizon, and you had, like, one gauge.  Yeah.  And the refresh rate for the screen was, like, you got one frame every five seconds. 
[01:03:00]  It was pretty much it.  And I picked that up and was thrilled with it.  I thought it was amazing.  Now this one, it's the new one that just came out.  It's Flight Simulator X.  And it looks amazing.  And the realism, everything from you're at the terminal, you know, you got to make sure  you get the proper clearance and radio frequencies for pushback.  You got to actually dial in the right radio frequencies for the pushback, taxi, and then 
[01:03:30]  departure, and then they hand you off to the different flight air traffic controllers and  then approach.  What if you just want to be on the runway?  You could just sit on the runway?  No, but what if you don't want to do anything but just fly?  Just fly?  You want to just back out and fly?  Yeah.  You could do that, too.  You could just, yeah, you could just take off.  When do you get fighter jets, like, telling you to land the plane?  Can you get that done?  I don't know.  They ought to put that in, though.  That's the stuff I would, like, experiment with.  I just got it yesterday.  Actually, flying, you know, from New York to Orlando, boring. 
[01:04:00]  I would, like, do all sorts of things and see what this game could do.  I just got the new one yesterday.  Yeah.  All right.  It's pretty similar to the previous one, but it looks a little better.  You should fly straight up in the air and not come down and see what happens.  Like, keep going up straight.  You will wing over and come down, yeah.  All right.  That's right.  All right.  Listen.  And just wing over and shut your engines off.  Listen.  I've done that.  I've shut the engines off.  Could you see the plummeting?  Yeah.  Wow.  See the plummeting.  We could talk about this all morning.  Of course we could.  But let's talk chess. 
[01:04:30]  And then we'll watch Whoopi just go right past us in the ratings here in New York.  Justin on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Sorry to take it back, but talking about going in the bathroom with a kid.  I was at a mall in the bathroom doing my thing or whatever.  Little kid walks in there.  He's going to the bathroom.  He walks over to me.  He's like, you know, mister, I made a mess on myself.  So I said, you know, go wash yourself in the sink or whatever.  So I walk out of the bathroom kind of the same time as him.  And he goes over to his mother and he goes, mommy, I made a mess, but this mister helped me clean it up. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, brother.  The face on that mother was unbelievable, man.  See, that's what you don't need.  See, we got to talk about this a little more after the break.  Take yourself out of the whole situation immediately.  Yes, my friend.  I know you're an 18-level wizard.  Can't you land a plane with your wand?  Very good.  Yes.  All right.  Yes, I can.  Yeah, after the break.  I can fly without a plane.  I'm a wizard.  After the break, we'll talk about how kids have gotten you in trouble when it was just an innocent situation. 
[01:05:30]  Let's get into that.  Are we going to do Uncle Willie's tickles today?  I hope so.  No, I don't sit and wear a captain hat in front of my computer.  Oh, yes, you do.  You probably do.  The captain's hat.  You probably do.  Dork.  Oh, my God.  He makes believe he used to fly in Vietnam.  I sit in my office with the door locked, and my girlfriend has to have a special knock to come in, so I know it's not terrorist.  I'll bet you have a little peephole you put in the door.  Yes. 
[01:06:00]  No, I don't.  Let's take a break.  We got lots to do still.  Bob Saget's calling in today?  Yep.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the ONA.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[01:06:30]  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks for checking us out.  If you like what you're hearing, you know, maybe you can tell somebody about it. 
[01:07:00]  That's how we spread the virus here.  John Hayden from Philly.  He writes on the Instant Feedback.  I suck on the phone, but I was on vacation with my girlfriend and her family.  The nine-year-old sister was there.  I was walking out of the kitchen, and the girl jumped in front of me, and I walked into her.  She fell down and was going to hit her head on the table, so I grabbed her hand as she fell so she didn't get hurt.  Her mom saw me grab her hand, and it was quick, so she assumed that I had hit the girl, which is why she was falling. 
[01:07:30]  The mother told her brother, who started giving me death threats.  Ain't that great?  Oh, there's more to the story.  I ended up having to break up with the girl a month later because her mom made my life a living hell any time I came around,  calling me a piece of ass and the like, all because I stopped her little girl from getting hurt.  I effing hate parents.  It's something we're talking about today.  You know, kids put you in these weird situations.  She'll let her crack a little head open.  And it's something that is very innocent, but maybe the parent walks in at the wrong time and starts thinking, 
[01:08:00]  what the hell's going on here?  Exactly, like it was on fire, and I had to spit on it to put it out.  Let's go to Nick in Maine.  Nick, what's going on?  I thought a snake bit him there.  I was sucking the poison out.  What's up, Nick?  I just wanted to call.  I ended up getting a ticket for the Guns N' Roses concert.  They ended up canceling on me and shit.  Wait, wait.  You can't curse.  When did they, when, you got tickets for the Guns N' Roses concert. 
[01:08:30]  When did they cancel?  The night of the concert.  Axl Rose called in and was like, yeah.  I don't want to perform for 3,200 people.  When is this?  This was this past Monday.  And you're calling why?  I just wanted to call.  Say hey.  I finally had to call.  Wait.  Axl canceled another show?  Enough with him canceling shows.  You know, it was kind of interesting when he did that back in, you know, late 80s.  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, Jane's back. 
[01:09:00]  Jane?  We can't get this done, though, Jane.  Jane's from Chicago.  Oh, right, okay.  She's a deaf friend of Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter.  We make fun of because it's just hilarious to see someone on TV that's deaf trying to do TV news.  I'm sorry.  Oh, I heard you talking to Jane.  It's a freak show.  I didn't think that that was appropriate, actually.  She does.  She does the reports on handicapped people.  Right.  They give her the story.  She's deaf, so she can't really speak that well because she's deaf. 
[01:09:30]  And her friend Jane is calling to defend her.  Her friend Jane, also deaf, has to use some kind of a relay thing.  Right.  She uses a relay service.  She's going to try this again.  So we talk, and then somebody types it.  Right.  She then sees it at her house and has to, I guess, type in what she wants to say back,  and then the person, the intermediary there, talks to us.  It's a nightmare.  We'll try it again.  All right.  Let's see what she has to say.  Jane, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:10:00]  This is Sprint IP Relay, Operator 2538, and you know how to use the relay service?  I have no idea how we use the relay service.  Miss, this is on the air, by the way.  I'm still going to explain the relay.  Okay.  The person on the line is using a free internet service to communicate with you.  The person's going to type their conversation, and I'm going to read it to you.  Okay.  When you hear the words go ahead, it means it's your turn to speak, and at that point,  I ask you to speak directly to the caller, and everything that is heard will be typed to them verbatim.  All right, who starts? 
[01:10:30]  I'm going to type that to her, and then she'll begin.  One moment, please.  All right.  All right, you guys, let's try to talk one at a time.  Maybe that'll help this whole process.  I don't appreciate the tomfoolery, by the way.  That's right.  No.  Here's Jane.  She's deaf.  She's going to defend Karen Meyer.  Okay.  The deaf reporter out of Chicago that makes us laugh on a daily basis.  She didn't hear that.  Oh.  Thank you for holding radio again.  Me, you mean-spirited people.  Go ahead.  Oh, that's us? 
[01:11:00]  So it's our turn?  Go ahead.  It means it's your turn.  We're not mean-spirited.  We just...  Like to laugh.  We like to laugh.  This takes a while, I guess.  It's okay.  They haven't figured this one out.  Oh, go ahead?  We've got to do the go-ahead part.  Go ahead.  Roger Wilco.  People laugh at you and not with you.  Go ahead. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, she said...  Wow, really?  No, I think people are laughing with us and not at us.  I think it's hilarious that there's a deaf reporter on TV giving us the news.  She's there for us to laugh at.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Wow.  What'd they do before technology?  They just punch deaf people. 
[01:12:00]  It is not nice to make fun of people who are hearing impaired.  It is not our fault.  We try our best.  She is not there to laugh at.  She is trying her best.  Go ahead.  Mm-hmm.  Well, what does it matter?  Because you can't hear what we're saying about you.  Go ahead.  Is that good? 
[01:12:30]  That was a good one, right?  Thank you.  Kind of makes sense.  I didn't even think about it like that.  How can the deaf get mad?  The deaf and the Amish, I think, is the safe bets because they're not going to hear what  we have to say.  The Amish are safe from being moved on for like a week.  Go ahead.  My friends tell me you are stupid and dumb.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Why are your friends listening to this show? 
[01:13:00]  We're despicable human beings.  And how do you hear them with those two candy dishes hanging on the sides of your head?  Go ahead.  We're having an argument with a deaf person.  An argument.  How awful are we?  With a deaf person over the radio.  By the way, it's time to take it up a notch.  Head.  Who's with me?  Of course. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't make fun of them.  Why do you have to make fun of everyone?  Are you uncomfortable with yourself?  Go ahead.  We like to make fun of easy targets because they can't fight back.  Go ahead.  Being honest.  Hmm.  Man, this arguing with a deaf person takes a long time.  It takes so long.  Well, look around your room. 
[01:14:00]  A lot of easy targets.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Would that just be LOL?  Good.  It's worth it because you guys are mean people who should just leave and let Whoopi take over. 
[01:14:30]  Go ahead.  Why don't you just, why don't you shut up and take your pristine iPod earplugs and throw them away?  Go ahead.  That Whoopi take over.  Wake up to silence.  Go ahead.  And you have to write that we sang it.  Yeah.  Musical notes around it.  Boy, I feel bad for the poor girl that's typing. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's a horrid job.  No kidding.  It's thankless.  He must have said a lot there.  By the way, just the way the other one fights back, you are dumb and not nice.  I know.  This is, how old are you?  It's like the, it's the least bit of information possible they put out, you know?  I think we should all just get together and play Twister and have a good time. 
[01:15:30]  Let's just blow over.  Go ahead.  Would you, would you be comfortable drinking out of our mules?  Go ahead.  Oh, very good, Jimmy.  By the way, operator chick, you sound really hot.  That's not for her.  That's for you.  A lot of people checking in.  A lot of people saying that.  Yeah.  Operator chick.  She's supposed to remain neutral.  I understand that.  It's not about her.  But she heard and she knows.  Yeah.  She knows she's sexy. 
[01:16:00]  She probably wear a little skirt.  A little short skirt.  Thighs are showing.  Hey, everything Jimmy says, could you just type exclamation points after it?  Yeah, he loves exclamation points.  He talks like that.  Don't talk to the operator.  Talk to me.  Right.  Oh, right.  You being the deaf girl.  Right.  Yeah.  Okay.  You have to be her.  What did she just say?  What a great life that's got to be.  Over.  Go ahead. 
[01:16:30]  Roger Wilco.  Hey.  And do you think, do you think the operator would be up for a good shish kebabbing?  We must be doing well if the deaf people know about the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Let's be honest here.  This is.  I said talk to me and explain why you like Nazis and tormenting homeless.  Go ahead.  Well.  Speak for itself.  Oh, do I have to step in here?  We don't want to talk to you because it takes too long for a response. 
[01:17:00]  We will talk to you.  I'm talking to you now.  How hot do you think the woman typing is?  Go ahead.  And do you think she's a two, a two or a three holer?  Go ahead.  Feel bad for the operator.  She has to type whatever we say.  I know.  It's horrible.  I've liked Twister ever since I was a child. 
[01:17:30]  Good, stupid, white, black people.  Homey boys who eat spinach every day.  Go ahead.  Do you think the operator has ever laid down with a Negro?  Go ahead.  You have to type in operator.  That's your job.  Of course.  She knows her job.  Her job.  She's probably heard worse.  I don't know when.  Oh, by the way.  Go ahead. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, she sounds hot.  I think she has a nice tit.  Go ahead.  Oh, hey.  Wow.  The deaf lady has a potty mouth.  We just had to dump out of what she said.  Do you think she said that?  Or is that the operator just pushing herself?  The deaf lady probably said something else stupid like,  You're dumb.  Be nice. 
[01:18:30]  Childlike, idiotic arguing skills.  The operator's all saucy.  Well, I don't know where this is going.  Well, let's talk to the deaf.  Deaf broad.  Is there something you do special in bed to make up for the fact that you can't hear?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Good question.  I don't hear any typing.  I don't hear typing. 
[01:19:00]  I'm just happy typing.  I think the operator likes when people have cyber on this thing.  I like to scream a lot.  Go ahead.  The deaf girl likes to scream a lot when she's having sex?  Yeah, but she's just yelling, why?  Why?  She can't hear what's going on.  That's going to be creepy.  Are you a size queen?  Go ahead. 
[01:19:30]  We should ask how she knows so much about the show.  Yeah.  I think we're on DirecTV, right?  Yeah, but you can't watch us.  No, I think they might have closed caption.  Are you kidding me?  Do they have closed caption on DirecTV?  That would be amazing.  Because how does this deaf girl know all about us?  How does this show read?  Go ahead.  Okay.  We got one more coming after she responds?  All right.  I usually call those hotlines through this thing.  It is fun.  Friends tell me and can get it put into words on the internet. 
[01:20:00]  The internet.  All right.  We got one more from Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Functious!  Go ahead.  You know, this Jane girl, I think she's all right, actually.  This operator's a goer.  Yeah, this operator's a goer. 
[01:20:30]  Can the operator tell us where she is?  Wow, she knows how to type.  She's good.  I would hope so.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  We're just about done with it.  Wow, this is hard.  I think the operator is under your desk.  Go ahead.  Very nice.  All right, listen.  We got to wrap up because we got to do radio for people that could hear. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Jane in Chicago, let's not forget that Karen Myers is being exploited by that TV station  there in Chicago.  No one is watching Karen Meyer because she's a brilliant journalist.  They're watching because it's a freak show, and that's the reality of what's going on in  Chicago.  Go ahead.  I think this is Karen Meyer.  I don't know the name.  No.  You don't think so?  Oh, well, wait a minute.  We haven't heard a talk.  Why can't we just hear her make a noise?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Well, then with that, maybe Jane could call up the show, and we could just yell at her.  Tell her to sing.  She probably sounds like Young Frankenstein.  Love you guys.  Punching out.  Go ahead.  Signing off.  All right.  See, she listens to the show.  Listens.  Thank you, hot operator chick.  Have a good day.  All right, operator.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, boy.  She didn't sound happy having to deal with that part of the conversation.  No, could she be?  Thank you.  Rich and Paramus, what's up?  You know, I just drove into a pole listening to that. 
[01:22:00]  No.  No, no.  No one ever actually really drives into a pole.  A pole or a wall or an abutment.  All right.  You know, imagine somebody tuning in for the first time and hearing that.  They're not going to know what that thing is, public access or something.  Yeah, no kidding.  KDK1.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Jack in Westchester.  Jack.  Best bit ever.  Frankus.  Frankus.  Frankus, go ahead. 
[01:22:30]  I don't know.  That was a fan suggestion.  Yeah.  She doesn't even care.  Like, she just typed it up.  She was miserable.  How could she not be?  We were asking if the operator would have been a Negro.  I just want to hear that.  Awful.  We made it work, finally, because that Jane girl's been calling our show here and there  for the last month, so.  Apparently a friend.  All right.  Fan of the show.  Let's go to Cynthia before we take a break.  Cynthia, what's up?  Hey.  I can't top that.  I can't top that at all.  Oh, they're talking to a guest girl. 
[01:23:00]  Give it a try.  Well, I called up to say something about things happening funny with kids.  And she caught it, and that was really good, though.  Okay.  So what did you want to say?  There was kids in my yard swimming in my pool one time, and they'd call me, hey, Mrs.  C, Mrs. C, look out the window.  They all had their bathing suits up in the air.  Now, I'm talking they were between 10 and 15.  Yeah.  So they're budding, and they're all holding their bathing suits up.  They thought it was cool because it was getting dark out, and they could take their bathing 
[01:23:30]  suits off.  Why'd they call you Mrs. C?  Is that your name, or what do you act like?  Cynthia.  Cynthia's my name.  Mrs. C.  So you had pre-teens in your pool completely naked?  Oh, yeah.  Two girls and one boy.  Yeah.  And I was-  What the hell are you running there?  A brothel?  Yeah, that's what the parents thought.  That's what the parents thought.  That's what the parents thought.  Paradise, yeah.  All right.  It could have got me in big trouble, though.  All right.  We'll take more of those phone calls after the break.  Thank you, Cynthia from Jersey.  Bye-bye.  Remember at the beach in California, I think it was, when we all went out there, laying down  on the beach? 
[01:24:00]  And I can't stand-  People, if you go to the beach with your kids, I don't care how young they are or whatever,  you can put bathing suits on them, because they run around, and remember the story I  told about, I rolled over, and there's this girl, she had to be maybe two or three years  old, standing right next to the blanket, stark naked, and I turned around and was staring  right into it, just like staring at it, and it's uncomfortable.  I don't know, look at that. 
[01:24:30]  Put bathing suits on your children.  Anthony, is it really uncomfortable?  It really was.  Is it really uncomfortable?  Because I couldn't get up to go into the water.  I think you got some thoughts in that head, and you just want everyone to take care of  it so that they don't pop out.  No, it's just, people don't understand.  They just think it's fine and dandy to let that go on.  It's not.  All right.  We got to take a break.  High school plays Hitler's speech as pregame music.  That's a huge story today.  We talked about the Thailand sex trade, but we never played the clips from Chris Hansen's 
[01:25:00]  report, I guess.  Right.  He's running out of shows, isn't he?  A little bit, yes.  He's trying to milk that as much as possible.  He's the child advocate now.  Just stick to it, doing what you do.  He'll go to Thailand and wreck their vibe, too.  Yeah, don't be a party.  The tsunami couldn't clear them out.  Nothing's going to.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

Liz from Cape Cod, she writes on the instant feedback.  When my kid was four, she begged to stand in line to see Santa Claus, then wanted to back  out when we made it to the front of the long line.  I made her go up anyway.  She gets on Santa's lap, looks him right in the eye and says, my mommy beats me. 
[01:26:00]  Wow.  I'm talking about that today.  The kids, you know, they throw in these weird situations that aren't true.  Get you in trouble.  Get you in a little bit of trouble.  Is there a shade?  Wow.  The sun is coming in and just blinding everybody here in New York City.  All right.  Let's get the Hitler speech out of the way.  We're also learning today that the FCC is going to allow news programs to curse. 
[01:26:30]  I would gather in the context of news.  How great is that, though, that the anchors, they don't read this closely and they're just  through their newscasts.  Oh, they think they could just be shock anchors?  Yeah, just pepper it with all sorts of saucy language.  That would be great.  Someone should test that.  Yeah.  See how much you could get away with.  All right.  Wait.  Let's play this really fast to see what it's about.  But they're allowing cursing on news programs.  Once again, they get carte blanche and they're a bunch of tablet scumbags. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Once again, they're looked at like they're different than the rest of the entertainment  industry.  They're in the same business we are.  Yep.  Yeah.  Want to get viewers or listeners or whatever it is.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  The days of the news being this dignified separate entity are over.  Over.  Here's the story.  Let's check in with Mark to find out about this thing where it's okay to swear on the  news.  What's up with that, Mark?  Thankfully.  Finally.  Well, you know what?  I've always wanted to.  And I don't feel comfortable doing it. 
[01:27:30]  Especially now that I'm sitting here thinking about it because the Surly executive producer  gave me this.  It's just what she described as associated press wire copy that indicates it's okay to  swear on news shows, according to the FCC.  You cannot swear on an awards show, according to the story.  But on the news, it's okay.  I think I'm going to wait until I see it in the paper, though.  Now, is it okay for a guest or an interviewee to swear or is it okay for the newscaster to  swear? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  Because in this case, it was someone being interviewed who said it during the live interview.  So we can't control what the person being interviewed says.  That's right.  Or if you're recounting what somebody else said in the course of being fined by the FCC  on an awards show.  If you're quoting the awards show.  Exactly.  Or if it's an awards show about news, can you swear there?  Ooh.  This is very blank and confusing, is all I know.  Isn't it, though?  All right.  Coming up here, what a difference a day makes.  The rain is over, but what about the temperatures?  Stupid Fox 5 here in New York.  I'm going to go right into the...  I'm sure it's nothing. 
[01:28:30]  It's a real story, so why don't you get the details?  I'm sure it's just if a curse slips by in some audio or they get a taped piece of, let's  say, somebody reacting to a death and they scream out a curse and they play that tape, they  can't be fined.  But I doubt the anchor can go, hey, this guy's a real, you know, F&A hole.  Look, we're not a news program, but we'll give you more details than that dumb Fox 5 here  in New York, which is a tabloid show.  There's nothing news about it. 
[01:29:00]  They all are now.  FCC backtracks on two charges of indecency.  It may be okay to swear on a news show, but profanities on other programs are still verboten.  Verboten.  The FCC announced Tuesday the agency reversed a ruling and had made that use of the word  wow, BS-er on the CBS program, the early show, was indecent.  That decision in March was particularly controversial because news shows traditionally had wide leeway  on language.  But this week, the FCC said it was deferring to a plausible characterization by the network 
[01:29:30]  that the incident was a news interview, which merits a higher standard for indecency violations.  Finally, the FCC upheld the main focus of the March ruling.  Unscripted profanities uttered during Fox's broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards in 2002  and 2003 were indecent.  In the 2002 show, Cher used the F-word after accepting an award.  In 2003, Nicole Richie used the F-word and the S-word in presenting an award.  FCC Chairman Kevin Martin defended the new rulings. 
[01:30:00]  Hollywood continues to argue they should be able to say the F-word on television whenever  they want.  The commission again disagrees.  Although Bono cursed and they said there was nothing offensive about him using the F-word.  Do you see, though, this is where these cowards, finally somebody fought these jackasses.  The new ruling decided on Monday comes in the wake of a lawsuit by the four major broadcast  TV networks challenging the March action.  You see, if somebody just sues the FCC and challenges them, then they back down.  They won't, though. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, on that one they did.  Yeah, on that one they did.  But the majority of them just won't.  They won't challenge it.  They'll get scared.  They'll pay the fines.  They'll run away.  Just challenge them.  Yeah.  Look, you might win.  B-S-er.  All right.  When did that come up in the early show?  Who knows?  I'd love to know, because I never hear about these things.  Why should the early show get Walter Cronkite type of respect in the news division?  What's the matter with people?  Why should they have no control over what people say, but we're supposed to? 
[01:31:00]  Plausible characterization by the network that Indecent was a news interview.  So doesn't that open up radio, though?  Of course it does.  If you do an exclusive news show, let's say it's a...  Sean Hannity, for the most part, right?  Is that considered a news show?  I don't know.  I'm thinking, like, let's take it, like, here in New York, the local tentanions.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I got you.  Your local news station.  That's all news all the time, blah, blah, blah.  Are they open to cursing? 
[01:31:30]  Now, can they play a curse word in the line of playing a tape of a story or something?  Or now Sean Hannity.  Is that considered news?  When we do a story that's actually a news story, why can't we use the language that was used in the story?  We're not a news show.  That's what they'll say.  Because it's the FCC and nothing makes sense.  But when is it, what's the line between a news show and doing news on the show? 
[01:32:00]  They have to classify you as a news show, I guess.  How is that done?  Don't know.  Where's the line?  How much news has to be part of your show before you're a news show?  I don't know, Ann.  Too many questions.  Everything's in this gray area.  I hate the fact that the media gets that special privilege.  B from South Carolina.  Today in the effing news.  Can you imagine, Anchor?  Today in the effing news.  I would watch every day.  How hysterical.  Talk about this girl's cans on Channel 11 here in New York. 
[01:32:30]  And the helicopter.  And the helicopter.  Well, it's a non-story, to be honest with you.  Who gives a crap?  Let's go to Ryan on Long Island.  Ryan?  Hey, what's happening, boys?  What's up, Ryan?  My friend was walking across the street.  His daughter was pitching a fit.  She didn't want to go.  And he's kind of half-dragging her.  You know how parents do that?  Hey, I know what you're going to say.  I don't want them to dump out.  Well, how are you going to do this?  I'm going to say it like this.  All right, go ahead.  Don't touch my vizuishi. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  The girl yelled, don't touch my...  My cold potato soup?  The girl yelled, don't touch my...  And just imagine the, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  But all of a sudden, out of nowhere, she yells that as you're crossing the street.  That could be a very embarrassing situation.  Let's go to Tom in New York City.  Tom?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  My kid went to second grade.  The teacher asked what your parents do for a living.  And we had to go up to school and explain how we sell drugs because we work for a pharmacy. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, so the kid goes, my daddy sells drugs?  Yeah.  That's good.  Stupid kids.  And now you have to go up to the school and explain that it's, you know, the legal kind?  Jesus.  What a pain in the ass.  Let's go to Bridget in Chicago.  The home of Karen Meyers.  Bridget.  Or Karen Meyers.  Doesn't matter.  She ain't gonna hear it.  All right.  Bridget.  Sorry about my son.  A couple years ago, me and my husband were in a store and he was throwing a fit because  he couldn't get what he wanted.  And it was like an all-out terror tantrum.  So I picked him up and we were walking out of the store and all of a sudden he started 
[01:34:00]  screaming for me not to stab him with the knife again.  He yelled, don't stab me with that knife?  Again.  Again?  Again, like you've done it before.  Exactly.  That's wonderful.  Yes.  How quick did you get out of that store?  Oh, I was running.  Yeah, absolutely.  And then when I got in the car, I beat his ass.  All right.  Thank you, Bridget.  Thank you.  All right.  Another cute story coming in.  A North Carolina high school apologizing for the use of an Adolf Hitler speech before  a soccer game.  The speech went out over the PA system for about 30 seconds before somebody stopped it. 
[01:34:30]  Too short.  The school principal says it was a mistake by a group of students who picked the wrong  speaker to try to motivate their team.  Well, yeah.  New procedures are in place to make sure and it all screens everything played over at the  PA system.  Lovely idea there, huh?  Yeah, you know, with the new...  She's editorializing.  Yeah, with the new ruling, couldn't she say, yeah, no effing S?  Yeah.  Wait, so what happened?  Apparently, there was a Hitler speech being played over the PA to motivate and get the 
[01:35:00]  students pumped up for the game, I guess.  I guess he yells, go team at the end of it.  Yeah, something like that.  What was he saying?  Part of the Nazi lady's speech, public address, high school soccer game, said neither the team's  coach knew about the speech before the 90-second excerpt was played.  The speech by Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels was in German. 
[01:35:30]  Of course it was.  Carpenter said in the letter the team had adopted the slogan, on to victory.  And the German exchange student, who plays on the team, had taught other students how  to say the phrase in German.  Oh, man.  Some of our more zealous students sought to capture the slogan in German and to play it  on the PA.  So it wasn't Hitler, it was Goebbels?  No.  They got the name wrong.  See?  This says Goebbels.  Was it Hitler or Goebbels?  That says Goebbels.  It says Goebbels. 
[01:36:00]  Let me hear a piece of the speech.  I'll tell you.  Ah, yeah.  We have any?  Oh, hey.  You don't have some of that?  No, you go home and listen to that.  A lot of time.  Catholic coach.  The Catholic coach said his squad was just real shocked.  All of us stopped and looked up at the booth.  That's great.  Catholic.  I mean, that's wrong.  That's wrong.  Could have been worse.  No one's really taken credit for this one.  Forest View won the playoff game, won nothing. 
[01:36:30]  All right, there you go.  So the students decided to take it upon themselves to just play that over the PA?  Yeah, yeah.  Play that over the PA.  I guess it gets them all revved up.  Yep.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jason in Pennsylvania.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  I was shopping with my wife at Walmart, and I noticed this woman wasn't paying attention  to her kid, and next thing I know, I see this little four-year-old, three- to four-year-old  running across the parking lot as the car is barreling through. 
[01:37:00]  So I do what I think is right, run and grab them right before the car, and next thing  I know, I hear her screaming, my kid's being kidnapped.  Luckily, on my case, they're having to be an off-duty cop standing right there, but that  could have really been pretty messed up.  So she thought you were kidnapping the kid, even though you were saving the kid's life  there?  Yep.  See, the kids do it to you.  Yeah, you don't save them.  You just leave them.  Yep.  It's too risky, right?  Yep.  Thin the herd. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  No problem.  All right.  What about that story where that guy killed the neighbor, because his daughter said that  the guy comes in the moonlight and touches me and does inappropriate, and kind of got a  little graphic about what he does?  And the father goes, all right, went next door and stabbed the guy to death.  And then it turns out, oops, that didn't happen.  Oh, it didn't happen?  Yeah.  Really?  I didn't hear that update on that story.  That's the update.  How did they find out that it didn't happen?  I guess through interviewing the kid and finding out, like, time and who was where, when, that 
[01:38:00]  it just didn't happen.  So now the father's up on murder charges.  The girl wasn't abused.  See, it's one of those things.  It's like, oh, Jesus.  Oh, you get in that situation.  Guy's coming at you with a knife.  You're like, what?  What happened?  What'd I do?  You touched my daughter.  No, I...  I did not.  I didn't.  I didn't.  Take that out of my chest.  Stupid kids.  All right.  MSNBC reports on underage Thailand sex trade. 
[01:38:30]  We started this before the flight simulator thing.  Ah, the...  Let's see.  Look, we're bringing it right back around here.  So Chris Hansen reports in Thailand.  Oh, he went to Thailand?  Good old Chris Hansen.  I'm getting myself in all these situations.  In Thailand on young girls being sold for sex.  All right.  Here we go.  A 15-year-old hustler named Paul is taking us to meet young girls who he says are available  for sex.  For sex.  For sex. 
[01:39:00]  Are available for sex.  This young hustler.  Well, I can't help but think that he's...  He's got a little...  A little too into it?  Well, just a little bit.  Not a lot.  Just a little.  I want to do this segment without the cameras and microphones.  Could I just do it with me and a pad and a pencil?  Sure.  Oh, I'll write down everything that happens.  Who he says are available for sex.  Along with a human rights investigator, we follow Paul through some alleys into a ramshackle 
[01:39:30]  house.  We think we've already seen it all.  But who could be prepared for this?  The Thai version of me.  Girls.  Some so young it could be in kindergarten.  All for sale.  Throughout the village we see the same scene at one brothel after another.  Everyone here seems to know a little English.  When they talk about sex, they use simple, childlike terms anyone can understand. 
[01:40:00]  Boom, boom, yum, yum.  Yeah, boom, boom, yum, yum.  Boom, boom, yum, yum means oral sex.  Boom, boom means intercourse.  Well, that's old nom talk.  Mm-hmm.  Boom, boom.  Boom, boom and yum, yum?  Yeah.  They might have dumped out.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I don't know.  But boom, boom and yum, yum.  Yeah.  Is this guy really breaking any new ground here?  No.  Does anyone not know that this has been going on over there? 
[01:40:30]  I want to get my airline tickets.  Boom, boom and some yum, yum.  You know what I find amazing?  We're all in the same world.  It's just, you know, we all hang out at Starbucks and they're hanging out in these  joints.  Ah, they're there.  We're on the same freaking orb.  Child prostitution.  How bizarre is that?  We got a little more to the story here.  We meet dozens of children.  This girl says she's nine.  Yum, yum.  Yum, yum.  Yum, yum.  No.  No.  No, no.  Not too young. 
[01:41:00]  Yum, yum.  She knows how yum, yum.  She's joined by another who says she's 10.  Both say they know how to perform oral sex.  And they even tell us how much it will cost.  How do you want to go to that base?  No, you don't know.  They're 30 and two girls?  60.  That's 60 American dollars.  The pimp says if two girls aren't enough, how about three?  Three girls.  Happy, happy, happy.  You, yeah.  Happy, happy.  How much are three girls?  Three girls, 90.  This girl promises we'll be happy. 
[01:41:30]  After you.  You can be right.  You can be right.  Our team then leaves, saying we may come back later.  In the car, the grim reality has set in for human rights investigator Bob Mosier.  In 20 years as a cop, he says he's never seen anything like this.  Has he ever been there?  Liar, liar.  Sing to your show, Hanson.  Yeah, exactly.  Hanson's a water walker.  I get it.  Y'all loved Chris Hanson. 
[01:42:00]  Y'all can make me do yum, yum.  Only one of me.  I love how he goes, we may be back.  And then there's like a pause.  Yeah.  Like he was going to add, when the cameras are off.  Maybe back later.  For Shaq.  When the cameras.  For some boom bull.  Stop filming.  Or some yum yum.  Man, that is just.  It's all, but who didn't know this was going on?  It's Thailand.  It's an epidemic too, right?  They got everybody, they got pedophiles flying over there like crazy. 
[01:42:30]  Germans and all that stuff.  Now they look.  Do you think the government in general looks the other way because it's bringing in a ton of money to this awful country?  Their government does.  The whole country?  This government doesn't, apparently.  Yeah, but how does.  The businessman just got nailed for taking too many trips to Thailand.  So they were actually able to get a warrant off of that and look at his computer.  Yeah.  Took too many trips to Thailand for no reason.  Didn't have a good enough reason.  That's how they got it?  A warrant to look into his computer.  And what they found was snatched. 
[01:43:00]  There must have been other reasons though.  Yeah, there's probably something else.  Asked to be other reasons.  Just whatever I read.  But that was part of it.  Was, you know, if you're flying off to Thailand, well, oh, here's what it was.  Customs.  He got caught in customs.  And customs was able to go through his computer because he had made too many trips to Thailand.  So customs pulled him aside because they know that that's an epidemic over there.  If you're making all kinds of trips to Colombia and you have no business to be going to Colombia, 
[01:43:30]  they're going to look in your luggage and say, you know, look for Coke.  So if you're going to Thailand, they're going to look in your computer and your laptop and see if there's any pornography in there.  You've got to love the Patriot Act.  You know how much he must have been sweating when they open that computer?  What's the music when your computer turns on?  Do-do-do-do-do.  Oh, you think when he heard that?  Boots up.  Yeah.  Bring.  That little sound it makes.  Just naked kids running out of the computer.  And he's just sweating like, oh, it's so close. 
[01:44:00]  Maybe the file's corrupted.  Maybe they won't.  Bing.  There it is.  But he knows the file name is like August 2005 trip.  It's just right there on the desktop.  There's some guy that's done this a thousand times, knows exactly where to look, just going,  typing away on your laptop.  Right.  Oh, boy.  Because, you know, he probably hides the file names, but all you've got to do is like  a JPEG search.  Doesn't matter what you call them.  Doesn't matter what you call them. 
[01:44:30]  They're going to pop up.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, this is a good one.  Well, hey.  Oh, wait.  Updated.  Sorry.  Instant feedback.  A lot of comments.  Someone from their cell phone.  All they could say about the audio we just played.  That used to be ten bucks.  Stupid inflation.  He's mad about the pricing.  Right.  For boom, boom.  And yum, yum.  And yum, yum.  You want three for yum, yum.  It used to be 20, and now it's 60. 
[01:45:00]  Unbelievable.  I've got to agree with Ralph here, by the way.  Ralph, what's up?  Nothing.  He's probably done more to encourage people to go there, like a free advertisement for  people that want to go.  Yeah, the news doesn't understand that about these things.  Yeah, if you've got someone on the fence that's like, I don't know, I want to do this,  but I don't want to get in trouble.  There are so many times the news is doing some crazy report on some maybe, I don't know,  let's just go with a violent video game or whatnot, and they think they're do-gooders  and they're going to make sure that this violent video game is taken off the shelves, and instead- 
[01:45:30]  It sells millions.  It just goes through the roof.  Everybody wants to get their hands on it, and I'm sure there's enough creeps out there.  That's what just happened with this MSNBC story.  Who gets to go to Thailand without drawing any suspicion?  It's got to just be a single guy that has no family, because how the hell can you explain  to anybody, unless you have business, unless you're, you know, the king of rubber dog  do, and the rubber dog duty factory is there, and you want to check on it, and even then 
[01:46:00]  it's a little suspect.  How do you tell your family, yeah, I'm going to Thailand?  They say the beaches are amazing.  Yeah.  They say they got some of the top resorts in the world.  Is that how they cover it up?  That's what I'm thinking is where the cover-up begins, because I'm with you.  I think most people that go to Vietnam and Thailand and all these places, they're not crawling  around in little foxholes to see how it was back in Vietnam.  You might do that for an hour in between, you know, boners, you know, because you got 
[01:46:30]  some time to kill, so maybe, maybe you're checking out the sites and crawling around  in the foxholes, but in general, we know why you're there.  It's Vietnam.  We know why you're there.  Thailand.  Right.  Yeah, how do you tell the family you're going there?  Yeah, just decided.  Go to Thailand.  Okay.  All right, let's say hi to Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, brothers.  How are you doing today?  Hey.  I was at a family reunion this summer at my uncle's lake, and I was swimming with my brother's 
[01:47:00]  kid, and I guess he didn't want to, like, play anymore, and he tried to swim away, and  he started yelling, Jim Norton, it's Zany's, December 1st at St. Charles, Illinois.  Wow.  I appreciate the sentiment, sir, but I had to cancel that to go to West Palm.  That's not my fault.  Ah, you tool.  He tried.  Thank you anyway, buddy, but that's true.  Goodbye.  He tried, and he blew it.  Failed miserably.  Let's go to Chris in D.C.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[01:47:30]  I just spent two weeks over in Thailand.  I was over in Bangkok in Chiang Mai, and it is-  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I know what you're going to say.  Why were you over there?  I'm a hasher.  Drinking club with a running problem, and we just had our inner hasher, our worldwide  tour.  Like, 6,000 of us went to Chiang Mai.  Excellent excuse to go to Thailand.  I have no idea what he's talking about.  We have no clue, bro.  Why would you blurt something?  Drinking club with a running problem.  You can look it up on the internet.  We basically, it's all over the world.  I still don't know what you're talking about.  Dude, dude.  Let's slow down. 
[01:48:00]  What are you talking about?  It's a hasher.  The Hash House Harriers.  Hash House Harriers.  Do you think we even know what the hell you're talking about?  Could you explain it in a way that everyone-  Wait for us to stop talking, and then you can talk.  Holy Jesus God.  I want to learn something.  That's the only reason I'm not hanging up on you.  What is a hasher?  It is a person who runs about three to five miles, a group of people.  We run for beer.  One person lays a trail. 
[01:48:30]  It's like cross country.  You run around, you lay a trail, and then-  Lay a trail of what?  Lay a trail of what?  Flower, chalk, just-  Isn't that just running in the-  Go to-  I got a website for you.  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, before you give out a website.  I want you, like a human being, to explain this, because you're not doing a good job.  Do you understand how silly you sound?  You're not explaining this.  Okay.  Back in 1938, a group of British patriots decided that they needed an excuse to drink and run 
[01:49:00]  and get in shape, so they founded a club in Malaysia.  It's now worldwide.  Every major city in the world has a club, and we get together weekly in D.C. down here,  and we run and we drink beer.  They run and drink beer.  That's it.  The whole purpose, to have fun and drink beer.  Why would you go to Thailand to do that?  Yeah, you could do that in, like-  Because every-  The woods of Pennsylvania.  You could do that anywhere. 
[01:49:30]  Every two years, all these clubs from all these major cities around the world get together,  and they pick a new location.  Two years ago, they went to Cardiff.  Two years before that, they were in Goa, India.  This year, it was Chiang Mai.  Next two years, it's going to be in Perth, Australia.  All right, so you went to Thailand, and what do you want to say about Thailand?  All right.  It's disgusting.  The Western people, the guys you see, all these white guys, old, fat, disgusting, in  these bars with 18, 19-year-old women.  It's embarrassing to be over there, but it is.  It's rancid.  If you're with an 18- or 19-year-old woman, that's fine. 
[01:50:00]  It's littered with dirty old white men, right?  Well, that's it.  It's dirty old white men, and it is completely illegal, but the cops right on the street  just see it happening.  You go up to a bar, there's 20 women sitting on the curb of the bar begging you to come  in, and then the first thing they do is introduce you to the madam.  Well, the cops take bribes over there.  I mean, they want a piece of the action.  It's illegal, but it happens left and right, and they all know about it.  In one of the magazines I was reading, it might have been, I think it might have been 
[01:50:30]  FHM or Maxim, they were talking about the BJ bar.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, where there's holes.  Oh, really?  And as you're standing there drinking your beer.  Oh, you drink your beer and about waist high.  Yeah.  Figure out the rest.  The bar has a...  An opening.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, we got to take a break.  Yes, I understand.  Kevin in Deer Park, what's up?  All right, we lost Kevin.  Are we going to get to Uncle...  I hope so. 
[01:51:00]  Want to try to do that next?  Do we need more than 10, 15 minutes?  I don't think so.  All right, we'll do...  What is it called again?  Uncle Willie's Tickles?  Yes.  Finally?  We got it all worked out.  We got to figure out who's playing who.  Yes.  All right, we'll do that next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony Show are appearing in  a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at OpieAndAnthony.com. 
[01:51:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  How much do looks matter?  Ugh, we'll get into that in a few minutes.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Just want to say hi to West Palm Beach.  Hey.  Good morning, West Palm Beach.  We're going to be broadcasting live from West Palm Beach on December 4th and 5th.  We're going to be appearing at the Buzz bake sale on December 2nd.  That would be a Saturday, I believe.  We're flying down on a Friday. 
[01:52:00]  We're doing the bake sale on Saturday.  And then our show will be live from West Palm Beach on December 4th and 5th.  Hoping a lot of the fans in that area stop on by the station and hang with us for those  two days.  Should be a really, really good time.  We've got to get to Pittsburgh.  We've got to get to Buffalo.  Although Buffalo's going to have to wait until the spring now because, you know, although  it's really nice in Buffalo and Rochester today.  Pittsburgh, Buffalo, they're on our radar screen.  Dallas.  We haven't been in Dallas in a while.  Chicago.  I think Chicago needs a little more time to develop, but we're paying attention to Chicago 
[01:52:30]  as well.  But definitely West Palm Beach, December 4th and 5th, broadcasting live on this fine radio  station.  And we'll be appearing at the Buzz bake sale on December 2nd.  Okay?  Okay.  Right.  Let's go to Crystal in Connecticut.  Oh, we've got a lot to do in the next 10, 15 minutes.  Yes, Crystal, go ahead.  Well, no, I've just been to Thailand.  How are you guys, by the way?  Good.  Why did you go? 
[01:53:00]  Well, some of Thailand is really, really beautiful, and other parts are just really  disgustingly nasty.  So, I mean, it's kind of like a double-edged sword when it comes down to it.  All right.  Here's the question we're asking everybody.  Why did you go to Thailand?  Well, my best friend is Thai.  Right.  So, like, we, you know, her mother actually has a company down here, well, in Bridgeport,  Connecticut.  And then, like, she also owns a construction company down there.  So, they live a very good life over there.  So, you're being a little more accurate than some of the other callers.  There is, like, you know, there's a really, really nice... 
[01:53:30]  Let's face it.  Like, I don't know if you're on the air.  I don't want to swear.  But, yeah, they're actual perverts.  That's why most...  Like, that guy that runs for beer...  That's bullshit.  Come on, man.  Nobody runs for beer to Thailand.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you can do that all over America.  Why do you have to go to Thailand to run through the woods as people are marking the path and  then you end with drinking beer at some pub in Thailand?  Is it on regular radio or no?  They're probably drinking beer from you.  That's for on regular radio.  They're probably picking up a kid and drinking beer a different way. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's also, when you go there, there's like...  I mean, even Bangkok is beautiful, but there's parts of it that are great.  Like, the beaches are fantastic.  But, yeah, you go to Boys Town, and Boys Town is like little 13-year-old boys that...  Well, it's Boys Town.  Yeah, what did you expect to be in Boys Town, miss?  It's fantastic, but, you know, whatever.  That's where...  And it's a lot of German people.  Lots of Germans go there to go and get their shit off.  Absolutely.  Jeez, you're a potty mouth.  I'm so sorry.  You are a...  All right, can I ask you, would you? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, and I told you, and you didn't listen.  All right, we got to let you go, Crystal.  Thank you.  She's cursing a little too much.  Yeah, someone on their cell phone bakes.  Bakesale, faggots, Johnny from Kansas.  Maybe we should explain the Bakesale is a...  Oh, my God, you idiot.  A massive all-day concert with bands like My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday, Papa Roach,  Three Days Grace, 30 Seconds to Mars, Buck Cherry, Flyleaf, then you got the second stage.  Did this moron actually think we were going to a bake sale? 
[01:55:00]  I actually did when I first started it.  Like a bake sale?  And Jimmy canceled the Chicago gig to come with us, because people are asking on the  instant feedback there, Jimmy.  Yeah, that's why I canceled Chicago.  Believe me, I'm not happy about it, and neither was the club, but it had to be done just because  Kenny wouldn't have been there, and I would have had to fly in.  It might have been screwed up.  All right.  A couple things with Jim Norton.  Don't forget, if you weren't listening earlier, Jimmy's on the cover of Steppin' Out magazine 
[01:55:30]  here in New York City.  If you're in the New York area, you can pick this up right on the front page, the front  cover.  Great picture, by the way, Jimmy.  Thank you.  And it says, the sweet smell of success.  Yes.  As being a stripper.  It's Jimmy with his Aussie shirt holding his nose, and the stripper is bent all the way  over.  You figure out the rest.  And the article's pretty good there, Jimmy.  Too many exclamation points.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy has nothing to do with the exclamation points if you read the article in Steppin' Out  magazine.  And Jimmy's playing the Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night.  A bunch of us are going to check out Jimmy and support the little fella.  Count up all the exclamation points. 
[01:56:00]  Count them.  See how many you got.  I bet there's hundreds.  I did.  There's too many.  Let's see.  Okay.  Here we go.  Hello.  This is a complaint email that just came in.  To Danny from Rebecca.  Hello.  I woke up on Thursday a.m. to your show.  I just want to let you know that I've listened to you on XM before, and you were funny there.  However, the stuff you were talking about on Thursday morning was not funny.  How can you make fun of the deaf community? 
[01:56:30]  It is not their fault.  They cannot hear.  That's the beauty of this.  Oh, this coming.  Why are you protecting the deaf?  They don't know any better.  They don't know what we're saying about them.  Them and the Amish.  Those should be the two groups that we could openly make fun of, and no one should have  to write a letter in their defense.  They can't hear.  Amish can't listen.  That's right.  Put yourself in their shoes, or better yet, what if your brother or sister was deaf?  Who cares?  Listen, you selfish tool.  What if our brother, sister, or other relatives has other kinds of ailments that we do goof 
[01:57:00]  on on this show on a daily basis?  How do you know we don't?  How do you know that our family members, you know, haven't died of cancer or heart disease  or anything else, how do you know we're not directly affected by those things that we  make fun of also?  But, of course, it hit home with you.  We were funny with all the other stuff that didn't hit home, and then it hits home with 
[01:57:30]  you, and now there's a problem.  Because someone in your family has those useless things on the side of their head.  Right.  So now there's a problem.  You're probably left at everything else we did up to this point, but now that we hit  too close to home, now you can't like us anymore.  You're more effective whispering into a clam on the half shell.  So, let me tell you a secret.  That's right.  Every time they fall asleep, somebody puts lemon in their ears, and they don't know  why. 
[01:58:00]  And by the way, I'm the deaf one in my family, so this affects me personally.  Put yourself in their shoes, or better yet, what if your brother or sister was deaf?  I don't mind putting myself in their shoes as long as I have to put myself in their earmuffs.  Hey, man, you don't have to share your iPod.  What about that?  Exactly.  How do you like them apples?  Exactly.  You don't have to share any of the music with your brother or sister.  Never ask you to turn up the volume on the TV, or turn it down, or anything. 
[01:58:30]  It's just there, whatever it is.  It could be blasting.  They're happy as a clam.  They just walk around.  Just sitting there.  Yeah.  Planes fly over the house.  You're trying to hear what's happening?  They don't care.  Nah.  They read that closed captioning like it's some kind of foreign movie.  They could care less.  It doesn't matter to them.  They play with blocks.  They just sit in the living room looking at pretty pictures, and they're in the background.  Brrring.  Brrring.  They don't even know.  Brrring. 
[01:59:00]  That's what deaf people do.  They play with colored blocks.  Smoke detector goes off.  Nothing.  Yeah.  They just sit there and burn.  They just sit there.  Sit there and burn.  They take two red blocks, and they bang them together.  They go...  That's what the deaf do.  They just bang colored blocks and make noises that they can't hear.  That's right.  We're saying it.  If you're deaf, you're also dumb.  That's right.  You're as dumb as the day is long.  She gives us a reading suggestion.  Oh, yeah.  Well, here we go.  Okay.  Put yourself in their shoes, or better yet, what if your brother or sister was deaf? 
[01:59:30]  How would that make you feel?  Could you believe your ears if your family member was deaf and you woke up to the Thursday  a.m. show?  She keeps calling it the Thursday a.m. show.  Yeah.  I'm just in shock over what I heard on Thursday a.m.  Fuck.  You need to take people into consideration before you target a group of people.  There's a book you should read, and God, if we don't have this book by tomorrow, people  are fired.  What books are called?  It's called Deaf Like Me. 
[02:00:00]  Ew.  Written by Eric Logan.  No, it's actually about a black rapper.  It's D-E-F like me.  Oh, he's deaf.  Thanks for your time, Rebecca.  You know what deaf people do for fun?  They pick up Play-Doh and they eat it.  I think you're confusing the deaf with the retarded, Jimmy.  They don't know no better.  You know what deaf people do?  They don't know no better.  They eat with their hands, and they just squish their mashed potatoes and go, gah.  That's what deaf people do. 
[02:00:30]  I saw Helen Keller.  I saw that movie.  They walk around the table and just pick stuff out of other people's plates and eat it.  They don't know no better.  They squish their hands and their potatoes.  They don't know no better.  Well, Rebecca, why don't you call the show?  Oh, I threw that out.  We've got to get that book.  Deaf people just don't.  They don't mean well, but they don't know no better.  They don't know it's wrong.  Nah.  You're going to get the book?  All right.  Maybe we'll learn something about the deaf.  I don't think so. 
[02:01:00]  What?  I can't hear very well.  I got wax in my ears.  Did you get that taken out yet?  No.  I thought you were going to get it done.  I've been busy.  I've got to go to the drugstore and get some kind of stuffed drops that loosens it up.  Ew.  And then I've got to go to the doctor and he takes this big thing that looks like a turkey baster and he shoves it in your ear and squeezes the bulb with warm water in it.  And then things come out.  Things in the shape of your ear canal.  It looks like one of those pyramid incense things.  I'd love to have that done. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, it's wonderful.  No, I don't like water in my ears at all.  No, it does, but it's good.  It's horrible.  Then once you shake it all out, then you can hear.  That's all those deaf people need is a good turkey bastering.  That's it.  It's just squeezy.  It probably got a wax buildup.  That's right.  Evan's going to help everybody out today from West Palm Beach.  The big sale refers to how baked everyone gets listening to 15 kick-ass bands and smoking out all day.  You big douche.  P.S.  They sell brownies.  You big douche.  By the way, thank you very much, Nathaniel. 
[02:02:00]  38 exclamation points in my interview in Steppin' Out.  Are you kidding me?  I told Chauncey.  I said, dude, he sent me a copy first.  I'm like, just take the exclamation points out.  You actually said that?  Yes.  And he did take a lot out.  But there's still 38 of them.  Dude, what are you doing?  Is there a reason to exclaim something 38 times?  Yeah, well, it covers up for the fact that you don't have confidence in your writing ability.  Poor writing.  Absolutely.  Dude, you don't need exclamation points. 
[02:02:30]  It's not the way I delivered jokes or lines.  No.  That's going to wreck your day, right, Jimmy?  You ruined it already.  See?  That's all the flu doesn't bother me.  That bothers me.  That's all it takes with Jimmy.  He was going to flu it up.  That's all it takes with Jimmy.  His day is ruined.  And he's not kidding, by the way.  Too much punctuation.  It's not necessary.  Cansionly an exclamation point.  You're going to die with a threat or a proclamation.  I wasn't making threats and proclamations.  I hate exclamation points.  They ruin writing. 
[02:03:00]  All right, let's go to Dane in West Palm.  It's all about West Palm Beach right now.  Dane, what's up?  Ten in a row, I use.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up, guys?  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  Okay.  Yeah?  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just want to let you guys know that my mom is deaf, and she teaches hard-of-hearing  kids, and I have no problem with you guys, and I think it's hilarious.  Yeah?  Thanks.  Say.  Yeah?  One guy.  Man. 
[02:03:30]  Thank you.  All right, let's say hi to Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hello?  I got a story about deaf.  Yes, and you're on the air, and we'd love to hear it, sir.  Oh, nice.  I was at a Christmas party last year, and there was a girl.  I thought her accent was a little weird, but she was pretty hot, you know?  And I ended up hooking up with her that night.  I thought she was English, and she went with it. 
[02:04:00]  She just told me she was...  She just went along.  She told me she was English.  I was drunk.  I'm real drunk.  I didn't really know what was going on.  And I wake up the next morning.  She starts talking to me, and I realize she was deaf.  And, yeah, that was a night.  What did the accent sound like when she was talking?  5-5.  You probably thought it was kind of like regal.  Yeah, yeah.  She was on the verge of retarded.  I want to go to the... 
[02:04:30]  All right.  Wow, she's smart.  Let's go to Richard.  How are you, Richard?  Oh, it's gone.  Hey, wow.  Richard in St. Louis.  What's going on, boys?  I was wondering, could you ask the deaf community why they even have names, since they're never  going to come to you if you call them?  That is a good point.  Shouldn't they be named after, like, symbols?  Just you have to hold up an octagon or something.  Yeah, and then they know, oh, he's calling me.  I'm octagon.  My name is Triangle.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Triangle shape.  They don't care if we make fun of you.  You know what deaf people do?  They like pudding.  They like to take pudding, throw it on the walls, and go, grrrr.  Bunch of pudding throwers.  I think you're mistaking deaf for retarded.  Yeah, but after you get past Helen Keller, let's be honest.  Yeah.  Name one more deaf person that did anything.  Including her.  She did nothing.  Let's go.  Thomas Alva Edison was deaf in one ear. 
[02:05:30]  One ear, though.  I would explain why he put out a lot of garbage products.  I'm talking about this.  I couldn't invent crap.  I'm talking about the sound of silence.  Complete silence.  Give me one more.  One.  One more.  Famous deaf person that has contributed to society.  Ashley Simpson.  Not tone deaf.  Oh.  Like, complete.  That looks funny. 
[02:06:00]  What?  Cameron Diaz slipped in Jack Black.  It's a movie.  That's fine.  It looks a movie.  Oh, is it another Christmas movie?  All right.  Jack Black does funny movies.  He's going to be on the show soon.  No, I know.  I'll tell him there's funny movies.  He's going to be on the show with that Tenacious D movie that's coming out, I think.  And by the way, that George Clooney, who's Russell Crowe, that Russell Crowe movie looks 
[02:06:30]  so horrible.  Which one?  Where he, like, goes back home, like, what's it called?  It's called The Good Year?  Yeah, One Good Year or A Good Year.  It looks so horrid.  One Good Year?  I didn't even hear about it.  He goes, like, he's a big businessman and he goes to a small town where he grew up or something  and he falls in love.  It's just garbage.  Oh, boy.  This could be a problem.  Birdman, what's up?  Oh, boy.  I wish I was deaf so I'd have to hear Jimmy Norton's stupid mouth.  Why?  What's wrong with Jimmy? 
[02:07:00]  No, I'm just kidding.  I love you guys.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  It was a great article, dude.  Thanks, man.  Too many exclamation points.  I got a text message.  Beethoven?  Ludwig van.  Yeah, I thought Beethoven, too.  Beethoven.  He was deaf.  Was he completely deaf?  He went deaf.  He might have contributed a few things.  He went deaf.  He went deaf.  He did the ninth, I think.  One of his most famous ones, he was totally deaf.  But again, by then, he knew the notes.  But you're crap.  You know what, though, Jimmy? 
[02:07:30]  He simplifies everything.  You can't sell Beethoven short?  No, because he's going back to that whole chess thing.  Yeah.  Where you can play blind and stuff, because you know the moves.  You know the moves.  You know the moves, or you know the notes.  I'm with Jimmy on this.  At that point, he knew the notes.  All right.  Dave from Indiana.  Who cares?  What did he contribute?  Let's go to Dave in Indiana.  Oh, that's the guy.  I thought he was the deaf example.  Dave?  Good morning, boys.  Yeah.  Hi.  Lou Ferrigno.  He's a famous deaf person.  Lou Ferrigno.  Exactly.  He's a green ass in a bad wig. 
[02:08:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Lou didn't contribute much.  No, not really.  That's not.  He contributed nothing.  He had muscles and went, eh, a lot.  Big guy.  And Jesse, on line three, I was going to call Jimmy out on that.  But why call a cute little Jimmy out?  What?  Jesse.  Hey, what's up, bu-bu-bu-boy?  What's up, Jesse?  Hey, Jimmy, when the guy just called talking about the deaf girl who sounded English.  Yeah.  Yeah, four score and seven years ago.  Oh, I know it was Lincoln, right?  That's by Lincoln.  Yeah, no, I know it was.  That's by an English guy.  No, no, I actually knew it was, but I just did it because it sat in four score. 
[02:08:30]  I did know that was Lincoln.  All right.  I couldn't think of a British speech.  Let's go to Lana.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  I know a famous deaf person.  She's an actress.  Yeah.  Molly Matlin.  Yeah, she stinks.  She was famous for, like, two movies.  And by the way, deaf people don't even type well on the computer.  You know what they do when you give them a keyboard?  They go, blah, blah, and they hit it with their palms.  If you're deaf, you're dumb. 
[02:09:00]  That's what I learned on the show today.  I don't know if they do that.  You try to email a deaf person, and they just go, blah.  Oh, no.  Club Soda Canning.  They'll make us all wish we were deaf.  Pablo Picasso got one ear.  What?  That was, wasn't that Vinny Van Gogh?  Don't.  Yeah, you idiot.  That was Pablo Picasso.  That was Vince Van Gogh there.  And, you know.  And Club Soda Kenny has one brain cell.  And very dry hair.  All right.  That's how we end today, unfortunately. 
[02:09:30]  I bet you Kenny has good hearing.  And because whenever the wind blows, his hair, he hears.  Like wheat.  I use conditioner.  Let's make a crop circle in his hair.  Acetone.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Thanks.  We had a lot of fun today.  If you're not joining us over at XM, well, you know what you can do.  Oh, come on.  Go after yourself.  That was good.  Have a great day.  I can fart and chew gum. 
[02:10:00]  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the Opie and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit.  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during  the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this sh**.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  Got a lot of people out here today because, you know, the weather's nice.  Where are these people when it's cold and rainy?  They abandon us, Opie.  They really do.  Look at this gaggle of shopping broads.  I want to talk to one in the middle.  Ha, ha, you're old.  She's already bent over.  Ha, ha.  You're old.  What a dick.  He is a creep. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, and she was, too.  She was all bent and being held up.  All hunched over.  Ha, ha, ha.  You're old.  I'll knock that out of the guy's hand.  He'll beat you up.  She's got to be sick of looking at her own feet.  That hunched over thing has really got to stink.  You're fucking ancient, and you're just bent over like you're going to get fucked in the ass.  Oh, it's awful.  And life does.  It's awful as you laugh, Jimmy.  Oh, it's really funny.  What is wrong with you?  New homeless guy, maybe?  Can we ask him where Andrew is? 
[02:11:30]  Who wants to approach?  I'll ask him.  I think he just pissed.  Did he?  Oh, boy.  He's talking to himself.  Do you know Andrew?  We're looking for Andrew.  He's the guy that used to hang out here.  Do you know Andrew?  No, you never heard of him.  What's your name?  He used to sit right there.  Hi, Phillip.  What's your situation?  We always talk to the guys along the road as we walk back to XM.  How are you in that situation?  No.  Are you homeless, fella?  That's a drag.  What are you going to do? 
[02:12:00]  All right.  How long are you being homeless?  How long are you homeless?  21 years.  Wow.  The World Trade Center.  Hold on.  Move that a little closer, guys.  The guy can talk.  About 21 years before the World Trade Center.  21 years before the World Trade Center?  Yeah.  But wouldn't you just take the time and add it to the Trade Center?  What do you mean?  Age 21.  Why are we homeless?  I'm not sure what you're saying. 
[02:12:30]  You're an actor?  No.  Sailor schools to actor schools.  I don't know what that is.  Sailor schools to actor schools.  I graduated on September 11th.  He's crazy.  Holy shit.  I got kicked out for drinking.  Okay.  About the other school.  One school to the other.  Where do you sleep?  Uh, homeless.  You just find a place to sleep?  What's the worst part of being homeless?  Like, when you take dumps?  Where do you take dumps? 
[02:13:00]  You just find a place to go or you find a public bathroom?  I don't know.  We got the whole country listening to you.  What do you want to say about the homeless?  His pants.  About the homeless?  Yeah.  Uh.  Bad, uh, bad government programs.  Yeah.  Uh, that's what it is.  Absolutely.  Yep.  What could the government, what could the government do to help? 
[02:13:30]  What could the government do to help?  I don't know if you heard that question.  Uh, I wouldn't do that.  I don't know if you think I'd do that.  Okay.  All right.  Uh.  Uh.  We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll keep looking for Andrew.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for, uh.  Okay.  There you go.  What'd you do?  I'm sorry.  I'm not talking to you.  You know, some of the homeless, uh, they know how to entertain.  You want it?  I earned that cake. 
[02:14:00]  He wouldn't take the five bucks.  Who's ever going to beat that?  Yeah, where's Andrew?  Should we get a bounty going?  You gotta, someone has to bring Andrew to the studio.  Find Andrew.  We'll give you a couple hundred dollars because we want to invite him to the homeless shopping  spree.  We're going to have a date for the homeless shopping spree.  Maybe by the end of today's show.  I tried to give him money.  He wouldn't take it.  No?  Are you shitting me?  I gave him five bucks.  He'll get it back.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  He's, uh.  That's why he's homeless.  He's not doing economics.  He's, he's very crazy.  He actually works, but he won't take his pay.  He is.  He was a nut. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  He's not a next-time subscriber.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  Look at her.  She used to be a goer, and now, look.  She's pushing a three-wheeler.  Three-wheeler with a handbrake.  So she can get across the street.  Oh, little old lady.  She's got a handbrake.  That's nice.  I'll give her a Burger King card.  All right.  Yeah.  She's got money.  She's got that fucking flag of chili around her neck.  Would you like a Burger King card?  Giving them away for the radio show.  Burger King cards?  You like hamburgers? 
[02:15:00]  You don't like hamburgers?  Why are you getting mad?  We're trying to give you a free Burger King coupon.  That's true.  Get over here.  Get over here.  You dropped something.  Excuse me.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  Wow, we're just in everyone's way today.  Did she turn around again?  That's good.  She's 60 in the little three-wheeler.  Oh, she keeps turning around.  A bunch of old frumps out today.  Is this yours?  Miss, you dropped something.  Why are you hiding?  She knows your voice. 
[02:15:30]  I know, really.  He just talked to her, and now he's yelling and hiding behind Opie.  He's ducking behind me.  He's a foot taller than me.  What an idiot.  Ducking behind a building, and his head still is close.  Oh, hey, hey.  Be careful with that left turn there, buddy.  Hey.  Hey.  I hate when pedestrians do this.  Hey.  And now I'm one of the guys.  Nothing else going on out here today, huh?  Nah.  It's nice, though.  People just kind of creeping out after that shitty weather we had yesterday.  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  How you doing?  Great.  Yeah, someone's got them.  Wonderful.  What happened?  Wait, miss?  Here's annoying.  I'm going to stand in the middle of the road until the light turns green, guys.  Oh, please walk in front of me.  Oh, he almost got hit by the plane.  I hate those motherfuckers.  I hate them.  Oh.  People stand in the middle of the road.  While they're crossing.  Like that.  You're in a lane.  You're in a lane that should be driven in.  You're in the road, stupid.  All right, here we go.  God, I hate that.  Hey.  Some ugly people out today. 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  Us included.  Hey, little fella.  That's right.  Turn that kid over to Uncle Willie.  Give him a tickle.  Give him a good tickling.  A little tickle.  A tickle his face with my fist.  There's something going on here.  Yeah.  Couldn't be an interesting conversation.  Are you a boy or a girl?  Drugs from Thailand.  What?  Come on.  Hi.  Hello, sir.  Hi.  How you doing?  I really was an androgynous idiot.  I miss. 
[02:17:00]  Very good.  See, the beauty is I do it right in their face.  Sir, sir.  Wow.  He's looking for the kitchen.  There is nothing going on today.  Kick that dog, Ophie.  No.  No?  Yeah.  Not with the camera rolling, you silly goose.  Oh.  Got about that.  Ooh.  All right.  Oh, Russell Peters.  I like him.  What's he doing?  Do you?  God damn.  Sucking cuck. 
[02:17:30]  I guess that's about it today, huh?  Yeah, there's just nothing going on on the walk.  Looking around, nothing.  The walk sucked fucking monkey ass today.  It was a couple good things.  Oh, there was nothing good.  All right.  We'll see you upstairs.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing? 
[02:18:00]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie. 
[02:18:30]  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I don't know if he's done. 
[02:19:00]  No.  He's done.  He's done.  He's done.  He's done.  He's done.  Thanks.  We'll be right back. 
[02:19:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:20:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:20:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:00]  I can't take any calls today.  What?  I wouldn't be able to hear them since my headphones aren't out.  Why would they be? 
[02:21:30]  Why would they be?  Why would they be?  Who's responsible for that, by the way, Than?  I know it's not Than because Than is always with us for the walkover.  Why do I have an email?  I'm responsible for that.  I don't want to yell at someone today.  Who's supposed to plug in my headphones?  Okay.  Who is it?  Is it E-Rock?  Oh, thank you.  Is it Danny?  Is it Steve?  Is it...  Who is it? 
[02:22:00]  Travis?  Is it Travis?  Bill?  I'll take responsibility, Anthony.  No, you can't.  Oh, boy.  Hey, uh...  I want to know.  The dump report.  Oh, no.  I earned these headphones.  I guess I'll never know.  Uh, Nick from Louisiana.  This can't be true.  Yeah.  Opie, my girlfriend cried after seeing the cake incident on YouTube. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Now I have to cancel my XM subscription, asshole.  So why don't I just be a man and punch her in the face and throw her to cheer up?  Why don't you cancel your marriage?  Pussy Whip.  Yeah, what a fucking groveling worm.  Cancel your marriage, bro.  You can't listen to XM?  She fucking can't handle a good cake stomping?  What is she going to do when we do the baby punching thing?  By the way, I got to thank No Filter Paul today.  He's got the comeback we should have had for Bob.  Hold it.  What?  You have to thank who?  Well, you know, we do.  Jesus.  We try to keep it honest here, and No Filter Paul has something good for the show. 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  What about Howard Stern having to run commercials on Free FM during the O&A show?  Yeah.  That happened for a morning, and we yelled and screamed and said,  What the fuck is this?  And they are not running Howard Stern's commercials on our show anymore.  What about that, Bob?  If that doesn't show desperation.  Did he really run commercials on...  I think it was when you were away in Atlanta.  All of a sudden, we go to break, and we're hearing commercials for Howard Stern's, I don't  know, one of his projects. 
[02:23:30]  One of those disasters.  I don't know what it was, to be honest.  That no demand.  Was it on demand?  You know.  That is hurting.  Oh, from what I hear.  Oh, boy.  Really?  A few insiders over there.  Wow.  What do you hear, Steve?  That nobody is signing up for it.  That it is a complete and utter failure on television.  Where people used to tune into E! and watch whatever happened the previous week. 
[02:24:00]  Now, it's so forced to put on some kind of sexual content that justifies the cost of  it, that it's awful.  And even the hardcore fans just aren't signing up for it.  I'll tell you why.  Because the internet, man, the last...  I mean, look.  Yep.  No one...  You don't need to pay to watch tits on TV.  That's not titillating anymore.  On the net, you can get a girl blowing a horse.  I mean...  Yeah.  I mean...  And that's how out of touch Howard is.  He can't do the type of show we do on regular radio, and that's why he'll stay on just satellite 
[02:24:30]  radio.  Oh, he'll spin it some other way, blah, blah, blah.  But all he is is a sex show.  That's all he is.  And he does a good interview every once in a while.  But he's not getting the big celebrities anymore because he doesn't have as many people  listening.  They know better.  Well, Torrance from Room, of course, 237.  Yeah, the commercials bring more people to the Opie and Anthony show, but it's Opie's pleasant  disposition that keeps them all... 
[02:25:00]  Desposition?  Desposition, Opie.  Desposition, Jesus.  But it's Opie's...  Fuck it.  It's Opie's pleasant disposition.  That keeps them all tuned in, bucko.  Whatever.  All right.  Why don't we move on?  Pleasant disposition.  All right.  Do we have the audio of Howard making fun of our FHM article?  How do you...  Right now.  The guy...  The only buzz or news that Howard has generated since he has gone to satellite, except for 
[02:25:30]  the initial, like, oh, my God, he came to satellite.  The only buzz he's had has been in financial statements.  It has been, you know, Sirius is announcing earnings or subs or this.  You might know that Sirius also has blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and Howard Stern.  And that's the only time you see his name mentioned in the news anymore. 
[02:26:00]  We're doing magazine articles and he's making fun of that.  It's called publicity.  It's called people wanting to read about you and do little exposés and photo shoots about  you.  You remember that, don't you, Howie?  That's the way it used to be with you.  Can we get Eric Logan on the phone?  Because I had a nightmare yesterday.  Oh, no.  What was it?  And I want to have sweet dreams. 
[02:26:30]  Eric's hair?  What was the nightmare?  Mel Karmazin was on with Jim Cramer.  Jim Cramer had his tongue so far up Mel's asshole, it was just uncomfortable to watch.  And I was having nightmares because there's our old boss that did not treat us well whatsoever  when we were with Infinity Broadcasting because he's in bed with Howard so deeply.  And then the discussion came up again about a merger between XM and the little doggy company.  And shivers went through my body that we would actually have to work for Mel again. 
[02:27:00]  Like shivers.  Dude.  Shivers.  I was like, oh, God.  Ain't gonna happen.  And he basically said it's not gonna happen, but anything's possible.  You know, that type of crap.  Anything to try to drive the stock price to pay.  Right.  Well, can I hear from Elo's mouth that it's not gonna happen anytime soon?  Go sit in your fucking tanning booth.  Because I was thinking about, you know, going back and having to work under him again,  and I was shivering at it because we're having so much fun now. 
[02:27:30]  You know, we'd sooner work for fucking CBS than, oh, oh, sorry.  No, at that point, we'd probably have to beg XM to let us go.  God, hi.  Because he just did not treat us right whatsoever.  I don't want you having nightmares.  I had nightmares because this is coming up from time to time.  Night terrors.  You know.  You know what would help if I put, maybe I'll come over, and this is not to be gay,  but while you're laying there in your nightshirt, I would rub scented oils on your chest.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  Only on my chest, though, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Not even on your whole chest, not your nipples.  Just on the V where your shirt is open.  I don't have a V.  I would put scented oils.  No, your shirt V.  Your shirt V, like in your nightshirt.  All right.  You'd have your stocking cap on, and I would rub scented oils.  What year is this?  You fucked me over so bad because you talk about this V, and now that we do the walkover,  these listeners are taking pictures of my gut going, what happened to the V?  He did have a V.  I never had a V.  It turned into an O.  I never had this so-called V. 
[02:28:30]  You did.  Everyone saw it.  It was the envy of all.  When I was down to 145 pounds, I almost had a V, but I had to lose at least another 15  to get it.  You can't get a V.  Dude, I'm awful.  I'm doing a lot of exercise.  Now that I'm in my early 30s, it's impossible to get a V.  Yeah.  It's impossible, all right.  I was out of college.  They're looking at me like, who is this kid in eighth grade?  What?  Who is?  That was one of the best ones ever. 
[02:29:00]  See, someone else saw the piece Kramer did on TV yesterday.  I was just, and the horseshit coming out of his mouth about that company.  Well, that's his whole thing.  Anything Mel says now, he's got quite the vested interest in Sirius, is going to be cheerleader  stuff, you know?  It's not going to be honest, fact-based information.  It's going to be pumping up the company, so the stock goes up.  And anything that he can spread any rumors about, like a merger between the two companies, 
[02:29:30]  it's just ain't going to happen.  There's federal regulations, first of all.  Monopoly and all that crap.  Yeah, you can't have one satellite company.  They won't allow it.  Unless they see both companies going down the shitter, then they might have to change regulations.  But right now, as of right now, the government will not allow a single satellite radio company.  Won't.  Won't allow it.  I would rather hear it from Elo. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, well, no one knows who that idiot is.  He's right here.  Elo.  Oh.  Elo.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi, Eric.  Did you see our old boss on Mad Money or whatever the hell that show is?  Yeah, where that guy was giving him a knob job?  Yeah, he was licking his anus.  Yes, he was.  Ooh.  And by the way, for the first time, I've got to tell you, I was in Rochester, New York,  getting ready for Brother Wheeze's roast, and I decided to listen to the earnings report  on the internet. 
[02:30:30]  To ours or theirs?  XM, the first one I ever listened in on.  What a bore fest.  Well, I wasn't on it this time.  Can't there be like a five-minute version where it gives all the highlights?  Like a Cliff Notes version?  Yeah, you get...  No, that's what the analysts love this stuff.  They love it long and drawn out.  That way they could pick apart every little word that was said or wasn't said.  I'm like thinking to myself, I want to start to, you know, give myself a little more knowledge  as far as the company I work for, and I decided to sit through that. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  People are getting scolded because they're asking two questions and you're only allowed  to ask one, and all sorts of stuff is going on.  You're not tiled into all the reports.  I mean, as the conference call is going on, all these people who cover our stock and Sirius'  and the industry, they start writing reports and send them out to all their clients to  buy or sell or upgrade or downgrade.  I mean, it's all happening in real time.  So it lasts an hour and it fills up the entire area.  Yeesh.  All right, so what's going on with the merger? 
[02:31:30]  There is no merger.  What merger?  Right.  All right.  Good, good.  No merger.  It's not going to happen.  I'm not kidding.  I saw Mel on Mad Money with Kramer and I was getting just the shivers because...  Yeah, we've seen that movie before, haven't we?  Of course.  Well, I mean, Ant and I, our careers just skyrocketed, you know, working for Infinity.  So in a way, I guess we've got to thank them, but we were miserable.  Well, and I've got to remember, too, I mean, I came in to Mel when we had 30 stations and  I saw, I've seen the movie. 
[02:32:00]  I've been on the other side when he starts doing all this.  But I mean, look, here's the reality.  I mean, if you sat through the call and got through everything, you realize that, you  know, we have one of the best fiscal quarters we've ever had.  Our loss is narrow.  We're going to turn free cash positive in 2004 and sustain free cash positive in 2007.  And we're proving to Wall Street that this is a business.  I mean, this is a very, very big business that's going to generate, you know, millions  and millions of cash flow.  So it's, you know, there's no merger.  If there was going to be a merger, it should have already happened.  And we're talking about positive cash flow by the end of the year? 
[02:32:30]  Free cash flow from operations, fourth quarter of this year is what we've stated.  And then sustained free cash flow for 207.  That's what we've said and that's what we continue to say.  And, you know, our whole mentality has been we're not going to go discount radios for,  you know, $5, giveaway free radios to get a bunch of subscribers that won't stick around.  We want to have slower growth and have a profitable business versus having tens of millions of  subscribers and have a non-profitable business because you can do that. 
[02:33:00]  We could grow this thing really fast and be completely unprofitable if we wanted to.  I've heard a lot of stories about serious units, one-year free subscriptions, sitting in  cars on car lots that haven't been sold yet, being counted as subs.  That is a very true statement.  How the hell do they get away with that?  Because the way they're, for that particular automotive segment for their business, I think 
[02:33:30]  it's actually Chrysler, some of the other ones, when they take delivery of the car, they're  actually paying for that radio.  So when a consumer buys it, it's already hot.  That's the reason why.  But they're actually getting paid for it.  It's not like they're illegally counting.  They're actually paid for it.  We do it differently.  We do it for 90 days with the majority of our providers, some are a year, but it's after  a consumer buys the cars when we start the clock.  Right.  They have like lots full of cars that are being counted as subs and they're sitting there 
[02:34:00]  with price stickers on the window in a car dealership.  That is a correct statement.  Being counted as a sub.  Unbelievable.  There you go.  I don't know how many people are listening to a parked car at a car dealership, but allegedly  somebody is.  Maybe a homeless guy.  You never know.  That's where your guy went with the cake.  He went there.  I aren't that serious, you know.  I live in it now.  Hey, Elo, how good is this show today? 
[02:34:30]  It was great.  I dumped out of it toward the end of the CBS show.  I didn't hear the walkover today, though.  Did you hear, Elo, even he knows that by the time we get to XM, the show is officially  over, he said, it was great, meaning we're done with our broadcast for today.  Oh, no, Elo.  No, it's like the exciting part of the shuttle and the XM shows like re-entry, you glide on  in.  Glide on in.  You never know, we could burn up in the atmosphere.  That is true. 
[02:35:00]  It happens.  But I did listen to the earnings report, learned some things, I guess, and no merger.  Any time you want to learn about churn or non-pay churn, let me know.  And Mad Money, when are you going to go on and punch Jim Kramer in the face?  You know, I would love to go on with Jim Kramer and just take him on toe-to-toe and just  call him out for everything that he is, because I get so annoyed with that whole thing.  I really do.  He's just happy to have Mel there.  He looks at Mel and he just gets goo-goo-gaga.  He published a report earlier this week that said, Mel, you better hurry. 
[02:35:30]  You better hurry.  And then he was on the next night.  It's like, ugh, stop it.  Yeah.  Well, let's book it.  Let's get you on there.  Let's do it.  Well, I've got to go through the IR people here.  You know, they get all jammed up when the content guy gets up there.  I start announcing big deals that I shouldn't be or something.  How is this program doing, though, as far as the XM Nation is concerned?  Go.  Well, Jimmy.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Did you like the deaf thing today?  I love the deaf.  That's how you ended the show.  I remember. 
[02:36:00]  Well, no.  We did more after that there.  No, that's what I...  Let me...  It's what I...  Well, we revisited.  You know, I don't even like to eat with deaf people anymore because, you know, last time  I ate with deaf people, I served goulash and they just took their shoes off and picked  up with their toes and went...  I've never seen that, Jimmy.  Jimmy, were you in Atlanta last week or two weeks ago?  I was there last week.  Yeah.  I had a pest call me on my cell phone and said, you called me an inconsolable neurotic douche. 
[02:36:30]  I don't think so.  On stage?  No, no, no.  It was afterwards.  The guy went up and talked to you and said hi.  And he's like, yeah, I'm talking to you.  Look, oh, yeah.  That guy's like an insane, crazy douche or something.  So...  That's why I said with a lot of affection.  No, I know.  That's why I was talking about the same.  I appreciate it.  Hey, I got the live stock ticker for XM right now.  Let's play rollercoaster.  The what?  Let's play the rollercoaster game.  I'm watching the ticker as we speak for XM.  Oh, yes.  I want to see if you can affect the stock.  Just say something really awful about the company so that it dips real low. 
[02:37:00]  And then say something really great and then we'll watch it go back up.  Oh, yeah, the SEC loves playing that game.  Jesus.  Well, we won't be doing that one.  Well, it was like Eric and I were talking about when he was telling me I should buy some stock  and there was a few announcements.  Yeah, sure.  I own no stock.  I should buy stock.  The company's doing well, right?  It's doing great.  We're going to have a great year.  Good buying opportunity.  Is it?  Right now.  It seems to be, yeah.  The window's closing, though. 
[02:37:30]  It's becoming a great buying opportunity now.  It's been ticking up a little bit more than down these days.  Well, but you know why?  I mean, Opie knows why.  He listened to the earnings call.  We announced fiscal responsibility.  Yeah.  How much is a share?  $13.65.  I'd like six shares, please.  Wow.  I'd like six shares.  Take them out of my check.  Six shares?  That's right.  Hey, think of those poor bastards that bought Sirius when it was at nine. 
[02:38:00]  Yes.  Jumped in at eight.  And everyone was, like, pumping it on the message boards, going, this is going to be  great.  This thing.  Hey, next stop, $15.  How much is it now?  Yeah.  Elo, what is it?  $4.12.  $4.12.  Elo, I don't want to put you on the spot, but is it true that Ron and Fez are getting fired?  I can't comment on that.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, thank you, Elo.  I can't comment on that.  You know, I don't know why you bring...  I've been talking to Super Agent Bob Eatman, but we're trying to figure it out.  We're trying to keep the show up and happy. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Thanks, Elo.  But I'll be back to Jimmy to your question.  The XM Nation loves the Opie and Anthony show.  When can we come down to DC?  I thought we were going recently.  We were, but I think we're going to postpone it because of the West Palm trip.  Okay.  All right.  Bye, guys.  That's what I heard.  All right, guys.  See you.  Bye.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  That was exciting.  There you go.  All right.  He has no comment on that.  He put a low.  So, Stern says, ONA article in FHM was awful.  He's such a douche. 
[02:39:00]  Of course he does.  Howard is such a douche.  He has no credibility at this point because he has to say everything about us is awful.  Of course.  And here we are.  From time to time, we do admit when Howard is like, you know, he did this right, he did  this right from time to time.  I mean, do we hate the fucking guy?  Absolutely.  But when you just have a blanket statement that we just suck at everything, people can't  believe you anymore.  Prepare for this.  Dude, why are you always talking about him? 
[02:39:30]  See?  You're talking about him again.  What?  We don't always.  Only when he talks about us.  That's right.  We haven't talked about him in a while.  This is him talking about us and us responding to that.  Right.  Asshole.  Asshole.  I was wondering if you, also in that same FHM article, did you see that?  Oh, it's got to kill him, by the way, because his horse-faced chick is in the same magazine  as us.  Yeah.  So he can't really promote the magazine. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  Ain't that great?  His chick is doing something in there, and he'd love to promote it, but we're in there  ruining it for him.  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Here we go.  I was wondering if you, also in that same FHM article, did you see that god-awful piece  on Opie and Anthony in there?  Yeah, that kind of ruined it for me.  It did for better.  I bet it did.  I bet it did.  Kind of ruined it for you. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, it did.  Well, no shit.  He's just kidding a little fucking manis.  Kind of ruined it a little bit.  Why?  What happened?  Would have been nice if your girlfriend, and then maybe they decided to do a story about  you, and had, you know, the crew from your show, and people that had come on your show  in that same article, same magazine, would have been great. 
[02:41:00]  He could have plugged the girlfriend in your show, but no one gives a flying fuck about  you, Howard.  And I'm sure he would have did the article if FHM paid probably the $100,000, because  it's all about money with this ass.  Who?  Who?  Oh, we wrecked it.  We wrecked it.  No one can.  See that god-awful piece on Opie and Anthony in there?  Yeah, that kind of ruined it for me.  It did for Beth, too.  The whole magazine is great, except for that.  Yeah, but the article is almost...  The whole magazine is great, except for that. 
[02:41:30]  Shut up, you twat.  You hole.  What the fuck have you done in your career?  You discolored hole.  What have you done in your career, except being the darkie on his show so he could do racial  humor back in the day when it wasn't acceptable?  Just lapped his ass.  You black hole.  Lapped his ass.  What the fuck have you done with your career?  The whole magazine is great, except for that.  Yeah, but the article is almost unintelligible. 
[02:42:00]  Like, I couldn't even follow it.  Well, somebody...  Ah, but you had to read it, didn't you, Howie?  Really?  You had to read it, right?  Couldn't follow it?  Remember the days...  It's a bunch of quotes from comedians.  Yeah, it's just a bunch of comics talking.  Fucking around and making fun of each other.  Yeah, it's sort of all over the place as far as making fun, yeah, and talking about Thanksgiving  and just fucking off.  That's what it's about.  That's why he didn't understand.  It's about, like, just guys hanging out, having fun.  And by the way, you know, that call was set up so he could talk about us and FHM. 
[02:42:30]  Of course.  Did you see it all horrible?  You guys make it sound like, wow, off the cuff.  Oh, no.  It said right on the screen, FHM, Opie and Anthony Arkel, hated it.  Yeah.  So, plunk down phone, and go.  Hoo-hoo.  Unintelligible.  Like, I couldn't even follow it.  Was somebody wrote about them?  Yeah.  I was reading it to see what it was about, and it's just...  At least he's finally admitting that he's, you know, reading up on us.  Because in the old days, anything we did is like, ah, Gary was telling me this, and I 
[02:43:00]  didn't...  I didn't see it, but I read about something.  Gary told me their Letterman appearance.  No, you saw our Letterman appearance.  I was reading it to see what it was about, and it's just the most horrible, boring kind  of thing.  I don't know, but maybe...  I don't know.  Yeah, that was kind of a bummer.  But I was shocked to see that Otto and George are, like, regulars on there.  Yeah, well, you know, I don't know.  They started doing a whole comedian thing.  I wonder why. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, that's it, Robin.  That black cunt.  That black-smelling cunt.  She is awful.  Does she really think that that's why comedians are on this show?  Yeah.  What a dope.  Yeah, because, yeah.  What a dope.  If you really want to get into it, Jackie wasn't allowed to talk much on the old version  of the show.  And then I think Howard, he saw that maybe you could allow a comedian to talk a lot more. 
[02:44:00]  Goddamn rich cunt.  You really want to get into it.  Who learned from who about comedians on a radio show?  Are we going to sit here and say we're the first radio show to have comedians?  Absolutely not.  But we took it to the next level.  Said, yeah, you could get a really, really funny comedian on the show and give him an  open mic instead of this from the old days.  Read that, Howard.  Read that, Howard.  Read that.  Sound funny.  Read that. 
[02:44:30]  Read that.  Douche.  Yeah, well, you know.  I don't know.  They started doing a whole comedian thing.  I wonder why.  I don't know anything about it.  Otto and George, good luck.  Um, what else?  They even sent out a tour of comedians to have their own tour.  I'm not pissed off at Otto.  I'm pissed off at George the Dumb and the puppet man.  Well, he makes all the decisions.  Yeah, exactly.  Why is Robin laughing?  Because we had a comedy tour. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, that.  I mean, if we did a comedy tour and it was a complete bust, then you have something to  laugh at.  But we did a comedy tour and people came out to the show in droves.  It was huge.  We set records for comedy shows at the PNC and down there in Twitter Center in the Philly  area.  If it sucked, you probably wouldn't even know about it.  If they really sucked, they probably wouldn't even have known about it.  It would have been like, uh, yeah.  She's laughing.  But it did very well. 
[02:45:30]  We did a successful comedy tour for our listeners.  Like, when was the last time Howard did anything for his listeners?  Ugh.  Ah, do you hate her?  Wow.  She hasn't contributed anything to this business except being a black hole.  That's it.  Yeah, her job was to be black, which she, you know, did, and to, uh, yeah, take away the  heat, take the heat off of Howard so he can do racially based humor, and be a woman so 
[02:46:00]  he could be the hole, and, uh, then he could do sexist humor, and he had it knocked.  That was her job.  Now, though, like Jim said before, with the internet and everything, you could see and  hear shit that was beyond your wildest fucking fuck fantasies years ago.  So now it's not shocking.  You can't be a shock jock anymore by having chicks in.  It ain't gonna work.  It ain't gonna happen anymore.  You can't be a fucking shock jock, have girls come in, hop on vibrators and do things. 
[02:46:30]  When all you have to do is go to your computer, which everyone has now, and pop up any fucking  bit of perversion you ever want to see.  That's shocking.  It's a shock box.  Yeah, radio is more challenging now than it's ever been.  And you know what?  We're not gonna hide.  Go check out the FHM article for yourself.  I think it's online, so you don't even have to go and buy it. 
[02:47:00]  There you go.  So we don't make a penny off you guys buying it.  Nice plug.  The December issue of FHM, we're in it and we're proud of it.  It's fine.  It's absolutely fine.  The writer took a different approach and got all the comedians just to kind of trash each  other.  It's funny when they, yeah, because when we get all you guys in here, it just turns into  a bash fest and it's hysterical.  And that's what the article is.  It's them bashing each other and some of the lines that are blurted out are hysterical.  Anyway. 
[02:47:30]  Boss even had a good one.  Also, E-Rock's pictures, he has behind-the-scenes pictures from the FHM shoot.  We weren't allowed to put them online until the article came out.  We had some.  We had some we were allowed to.  Now that the article's out, we have others that we just added behind-the-scenes stuff.  So go to opiananthony.com, okay?  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, listen, guys.  You know, it's funny I should tune in at this time because I wasn't expecting. 
[02:48:00]  I was really calling just to compliment you guys on your show.  And it's funny that you're talking about Howard, which I really find a big waste of time for  you guys.  I mean, your show is great.  Dude, dude.  It comes up from time to time.  And you know what?  If you don't like that part of the show, just turn it off.  But we're not going to allow...  No, no.  I'm not complaining.  I think it's ironic.  But we're not going to allow...  Because, you know, your show is great.  And why bother even comparing?  It's just so...  It's not even comparing.  It's...  We have always reacted whenever somebody talks about our show. 
[02:48:30]  So we're not just going to sit here and rattle off Howard's shit.  But when he starts bashing something we've done, we'll respond to it.  And we always have.  I just think it's funny that he...  I mean, it's funny that either one of you guys, you are him when we...  We always...  ...waste air on each other because, you know, you're different shows, whatever.  And I bought this thing to listen to Bob Dylan.  And frankly, I never turn your station off.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir. 
[02:49:00]  I appreciate it.  Jeff from Jersey.  You know, I mean...  Other people have had their radio careers destroyed because Howard will just spew all this  bullshit and these lies.  And the jocks were too scared to, like, defend themselves.  We've always defended ourselves and we always will.  And if you don't like that part of the show, I understand that.  Then go somewhere else for a little while.  And you want to goof on our comedy tour?  You want to goof on that?  Hey, Artie.  I noticed you were a little quiet during that segment. 
[02:49:30]  The guy had fucking the Howard Stern show to promote his fucking movie.  And what happened to that abomination?  That piece of shit?  Is it going into wide release?  Did you make your fucking numbers?  Oh, sorry.  I think the Howard Stern of years ago would have packed out fucking theaters.  What happened?  What happened, Artie?  Look over at your buddy, Howie.  And you've got to ask yourself, gee, what happened? 
[02:50:00]  I really thought plugging on this show would have been huge.  What happened to Brewer?  What happened to Jim Brewer?  He had that whole platform and Howie to plug a Westbury gig.  Westbury, you could fill up with a couple of mentions on a fucking popular show.  The place is full.  They had two of the five sections roped off empty and the other three sparsely filled  because no one's listening there. 
[02:50:30]  You get put into this fucking vacuum where if you're on Sirius, you think that's like  the end all, do all, be all of fucking radio.  Sorry, it really isn't.  You're delusional to think that.  It's not going to sell fucking tickets to shows.  It's not going to sell tickets to movies.  You're fucked sitting there to a niche audience.  How's Martha Stewart doing?  You hear a lot about her radio show.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Boy, let me tell you.  Wow.  Spent a fortune on it.  I'm so glad Howie's having the best time of his life.  This is wonderful.  The freedom, the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You're a niche show that has a very, very limited audience that will not continue to grow.  You had your boost.  You had your push.  You got your hardcore fans listening.  But everyone knows who you are and where you are now.  And if they wanted to listen to you, that's where they'd be. 
[02:51:30]  So be happy with the few hundred thousand that listen at any given moment.  Because I don't care if you have a million subscribers.  They're not all tuned in at the same time.  You have a few hundred thousand people listening to you at any given moment.  Enjoy.  We got millions.  They used to listen to you.  And we're going to be adding a couple markets.  And we keep adding markets, adding listeners.  Are we?  Yep.  Yeah.  Is that good?  Yeah.  Very good.  That's very good. 
[02:52:00]  Are they good markets?  Will I be happy?  You'll be happy.  Am I going to be happy?  Oh, yeah.  You'll be happy.  They all have comedy clubs now.  Skin back to me!  Hey, dare to drain.  That's a little too big for us.  We're a little lower than that.  Dare to drain.  Bill in Detroit, what's up?  Oh, Bill.  Hey.  Hi, guys.  Hey, I just picked up that FHM magazine this morning.  Did you?  You know, in all honesty, the way that article reads is the way the show goes.  So if you don't get the article, you'll never get the show.  Well, that's the thing. 
[02:52:30]  It really is.  It's not an article.  It's just a bunch of guys talking about Thanksgiving and shit.  And I think the thing he's used to is just him talking.  And it's like, that's not the way it is on this show.  It will go Ope, Ant.  It will go myself, Bill.  Everybody just kind of talks back and forth.  And we're doing something different.  We've done the Ope and Anthony story so many fucking times in newspapers and other magazines.  It's the same shit, the same questions.  So FHM was smart enough to get us, get the comedians of the show, and try to do something 
[02:53:00]  a little different.  The pictures are hilarious.  And quite frankly, the dialogue is very, very funny.  Very funny.  You're right.  You're right.  It is like the show.  You're right.  That is kind of the way the show is structured.  Did you hear how he said about the Spanish station here in New York being number one?  Because there's a limited amount of Spanish stations here in New York.  That's the only reason they're number one.  There's like two of them.  They have no competition.  So there's no competition, and there's a lot of Spanish people in New York.  It's just math in New York.  All over the fucking country.  Everywhere, please.  Everywhere.  Am I right or wrong?  You're right. 
[02:53:30]  And they tune into the station, and the station gets big ratings.  That's how it works.  Howard actually said, I know what the Spanish radio is all about.  They listen to the Howard Stern show and do it in Spanish.  He actually said that.  And I think someone then was brave enough.  They probably got fired for it.  Said, but Howard, do you know Spanish?  And Howard goes, no.  But I know that's what they're doing.  That's what they're doing.  He doesn't speak Spanish, but he knows they're listening to his show and doing it in Spanish. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  And he actually meant that.  Out of all the wacky, stupid Howard, they're ripping me off stuff, that one really was just  like, come on now.  You've got to be shitting me.  All right.  Enough?  Stupid Robin, though.  Yeah.  You've got to be honest.  And yes, Howard did a lot of amazing things for radio, but what the fuck did she actually  do?  Seriously.  She wrote a book about someone in her family sticking a thumb up her ass. 
[02:54:30]  Who gives a nice?  Nice.  Like you're the only one.  You pull out a plum?  You were hoping for the movie, weren't you, Robin?  Oops.  Didn't happen.  What happened to the talk show?  Oops.  Didn't happen.  What happened to that?  What the fuck have you done in this business, really?  You think about it.  You're a lackey.  You're a fucking lackey.  And you've been one for years.  I hope you at least get paid. 
[02:55:00]  I hope he at least has the common fucking decency to throw you a few bucks like the whore.  Does he fucking leave you pay on your night table every morning?  John in Chicago.  John.  New markets?  Yeah.  John.  Stay tuned.  When?  La, la.  La, la.  What are the markets?  La, la.  Tomorrow?  John in Chicago, what's up?  Hey there, Jen.  Come on, Jen. 
[02:55:30]  Speak up.  Is he even plunked down?  He wasn't, I guess.  No.  Sorry.  Hey there, Jen.  Chicago.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  So I have really no payoff for this phone call other than if you notice, like back in the  day, Howard used to always say that he never would stop fans or anyone from coming  on your show or any other show.  Which was a lie, by the way.  We have so many stories of people not coming on our show because they were told, you go  on the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is another reason why we hate his fucking guts, that they couldn't do Howard's 
[02:56:00]  show anymore.  Cock blocked.  The old cock block.  A little paranoid Howard, are you?  But right there during that little clip you played, you can tell exactly what he used  to do.  Because they were talking about Otto and George being on your show.  And he's like, all right, good luck, Otto and George.  Yeah.  He'll never be on Howard's show now because why?  He can't be on both shows.  I think Otto and George did Howard's show back in the day, then did our show for a number  of years.  And then we got fired.  Then he did Howard's show for a little bit.  And lately he's been killing on our show. 
[02:56:30]  He used to make fun of like...  And if he wants to go back on Howard's show, we'd be the ones to say, go for it if it helps  your career, Otto.  I can't do both.  Who cares?  We would say it tomorrow.  Why can't you do both?  And Howard used to bitch about Leno and Letterman.  Like, oh, they'd get into fights over which guests could do.  And he's like, so stupid.  Why can't they just do ball shows?  Well, hypocrite, now what?  They recently went to war over me at late night.  Yes, they did.  It was a war.  Yeah, it sure was, Jimmy.  And Letterman lost. 
[02:57:00]  So I did his show.  All right.  See what I did there?  Yes, you turned it around.  That's right.  Everybody thought it was going one way.  Funny guy.  And I go, bada-bing.  You're a funny guy.  All right.  All right.  The rest of the calls are whatever for now.  Dump report real fast because there's a couple issues here.  Where is it?  Dump report.  Hit it.  Jesus.  That's the only thing you needed to do in this hour.  I don't get to read it.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:57:30]  I used to get one.  I could read along.  Yeah, why didn't I used to actually read it?  Maybe I'll just make it up as I go along.  Why would I have a number for you?  You're more of an expert on the FCC.  So she took one in the shitter.  You're more of an expert on the FCC than I.  Oh, thank you.  I ply myself in knowing the general rules.  So I'm going to read these and you tell me what's going on here.  All right.  7.37 a.m.  They ended up canceling on me and shit.  Call her about Guns N' Roses show.  Well, shit.  7.47 a.m.  I think she has nice tits. 
[02:58:00]  Deaf relay operator on the phone.  Well, tits.  That could be the best dump ever right now, by the way.  Can't say tits.  Of course.  8.18 a.m.  Yum Yum is Oral Sex.  Now, this is...  Didn't we...  News.  Didn't we have Al listen to the Chris Hansen stuff ahead of...  No.  No.  No.  Oh, boy.  No.  We...  Hmm.  Oral Sex or Descriptions thereof.  Yeah, but it was on NBC, actually.  It was Chris Hansen from Dateline NBC talking about child sex trade in Thailand. 
[02:58:30]  You could say it on NBC, but you can't say it on the radio.  Yum Yum is Oral Sex.  I don't think CBS would mind if NBC got their license pulled.  Put it that way.  They don't care that it was on NBC.  Any talk about oral sex.  And any description of it.  We're just playing audio from a news program.  I know.  That's what drives us nuts in radio.  And I know what happened after that.  I know exactly what happened, too.  It was then put in a context and bye-bye to a lot of material. 
[02:59:00]  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  Yeah.  8.19.  Both know how to perform oral sex.  Chris Hansen from Dateline NBC talking about child sex trade in Thailand.  8.24.  You might do that in between boners.  Yeah.  Opie during discussion of child sex trade in Thailand.  Boner is okay during a non-sexual discussion.  Yeah.  How do you use boner in a non-sexual discussion?  Was a boner a mistake?  Boner's a mistake.  Nah, you could say boner.  You just can't say what it's doing. 
[02:59:30]  Give me...  Use it in a non-sexual sense.  Uh, boner pill.  I took a boner pill.  That's right.  I was bouncing a child on my lap, and I got a boner and came in my pants.  Another acceptable usage.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  I'm an FCC expert, too.  Boner pill.  I got a boner.  Can you even say that?  Yeah.  You just can't say, you know, anything about using that boner for anything.  How about, um...  Even, like, searching for coins on the beach with it.  Nothing. 
[03:00:00]  And nothing.  I gotta tell you.  Uh, let's see.  Uh, 8.29 a.m., the BJ bar.  Yep.  BJ, blowjob, anything like that will not be allowed.  Uh, BJ's okay during a non-sexual discussion as well.  How do you use BJ in a non-sexual...  Talking about an old sitcom of a trucker and a monkey.  That's right.  That was the funniest one ever.  Ah.  All right.  My name is BJ McKay, and this is my best friend, Bear.  Is it? 
[03:00:30]  Oh.  You know it.  It's like Howard and Robin.  Oh.  Take that!  Come on.  They're just two pals that have, uh, spent an entire career together.  That's all I meant.  Just, all right.  That's what we say to the shock jock today.  You should love how I ring the bell and get mad at myself for doing it like someone else  rang it.  All right.  And then...  All right.  It's enough with the bell.  841. 
[03:01:00]  That's bullshit.  And then 842.  Go get their shit off.  All right.  There.  I need some yum yum.  Oh!  Oh, what?  Who's handshake?  Uh, Jim in Virginia.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to ask real quick.  Uh, I didn't hear any other callers calling in about it.  What's up with this Ron and Fez shit?  Or is that just you fucking with the audience?  Well, what's up with the Ron and Fez shit is this.  They are going to...  Oh, God.  You are the dumbest fucking person that works for us. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, good Lord.  What's up with the Ron and Fez shit? 
[03:02:00]  Who, who, who?  Who, who?  Who, who, who?  Who, who, who?  Robin.  Who, who, who?  Who, who, who?  Who, who, who?  Robin.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Fred.  I invented everything.  I invented everything.  I invented everything.  Now, Wednesday. 
[03:02:30]  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a wow on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own wow sticker,  visit opieandanthony.com.  Wow stands for Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We pretty much say at this point, Whip Em Out Whenever.  It's going to be Whip Em Out any time, but that's a wow.  It works great when you're stuck in traffic going to a sporting event.  Wow.  One of these days you'll be driving.  A girl that's familiar with the program is going to see the wow,  know what it means, pull up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.  So there you have it.  Whip Em Out Wednesday.  And we're back. 
[03:03:00]  A little meltdown before the break, sorry.  Whoa.  Just a little bit, a little bit.  All right.  We, you know, we had a really good laugh, though, after you left the studio. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  We had a good laugh and a nice uncomfortable stare at Bill in the control room,  but he wouldn't look back at anybody.  Oh, poor Bill's shy.  He stared at the computer monitor, twitched, and touched his beard a lot.  And it was a scream.  He had the look on his face when you're babysitting and you walk in and the child is dead.  Yeah, how do you explain it?  Well, then I thought it was me.  So when I came back from the bathroom, I asked everybody.  I'm like, please tell me it wasn't me.  Did everyone see how obvious that was? 
[03:04:00]  And not one person even was on the fence.  I'll be the first one to call you out,  because sometimes in the heat of the show, wanting to put on a good show,  Opie will insist that the staff be mind readers.  And there are times where it is obvious, like, all right, that should be obvious.  But other times, I think it's just a passion for the show.  You're absolutely right.  That time, though, you walked in and questioned, and it was like, dude, no.  You gave him such a heads up. 
[03:04:30]  You could have held up a sign that you just wrote in his own blood carved from his chest,  and he still fucking missed it.  And he nodded.  That's the weird part, because I'm like, I think this is obvious what we want to do here,  but all right, I'm going to make sure I looked, and I got a nod.  There was hand signals going on.  I got a nod, like, I'm with you.  I'm with you.  I'm here.  I'm with you.  You fucking give me the word.  Right.  Yeah.  What about, how come E-Rock doesn't sit here anymore?  He used to always catch the brunt of it. 
[03:05:00]  E-Rock's very busy.  Doing what?  He reads his email and scrolls and highlights it, and does that over and over.  Oh, wait.  Wait a minute.  No.  Hey, we should have E-Rock do a request hour, by the way.  I see E-Rock with an audio wave form in front of him.  I'm sure it's some wrestler.  Where's E-Rock?  You want E-Rock to take requests today?  Oh, I'd love that.  Because we've got a couple of feedbacks coming in.  Someone wants to hear shit dick.  Someone wants to hear put the lotion in the basket.  And maybe it's time.  Are you crying?  Are you sleepy? 
[03:05:30]  Why are you crying, Eric?  What's wrong?  Nothing.  My contacts all...  Did you finally just realize that men aren't supposed to do things with other men that  you've been doing?  Yeah.  Was someone touching you with your bathing suit covers?  Does Uncle Willie tickle you?  What are you doing out there?  What do you do on a daily basis like that in here?  Walkover audio, worst of the week, worst of audio, a lot of that stuff.  I just know what you do over there at CBS.  Can you do a request hour for us today to get us to noon?  Sure, if you want.  How come Than sits here but stands over at CBS? 
[03:06:00]  Don't have a stool.  Don't have a stool over there?  Yeah.  They haven't requisitioned one for you?  Yeah.  All right, we're going to do a request hour with E-Rock at 11 o'clock.  Oh, I thought right now I was ready to leave.  I'm no kidding.  You know, you request all those things you haven't heard in a while.  Maybe some of the stuff that has fallen through the cracks.  E-Rock will play it for you today starting at 11.  Sam, what are you filming?  Just in case there's Radio Gold that happens.  I'm with Sam.  You never know.  You never know.  Whenever E-Rock comes in the studio, I like to have a camera ready. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Fair enough.  A camera.  A camera.  I'm having a camera.  Where are you from again?  Where are you from?  New York.  Yeah, New York, of course.  I like having a camera.  A camera.  Take photographs and video on my camera.  Ah, camera ready.  He's E-Rock comes in.  His stupid rosacea.  I like her redding his cheeks with a harder slap.  He's got Sterling Hitchcock cheeks.  That stupid Yankees picture.  His stupid rosacea face.  I hate Prince William or Prince Harry. 
[03:07:00]  Which one of them always has it?  Those rosy cheeks.  A couple from DJ Ain't a Lightbulb.  A full score and seven years ago.  Sorry.  Just a little call back to your fuck up.  I'll take this.  Good work.  It's just hurtful.  I was trying to be hurtful.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  DJ Ain't a Lightbulb from posthores.net.  He's crying because he heard Hellman's is going out of business.  Oh.  And he also writes,  Just heard one of the dumbest things ever on an XM spot for a program called Before the Music Dies. 
[03:07:30]  Some ass said,  Today Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder wouldn't get a chance.  They're blind.  Oh, to be like huge stars on the radio in the music business.  Do we have that spot?  Maybe there's attractive people that they're looking for.  People with all their senses.  I have no idea.  Well, because they're...  Oh, yeah.  Well, that too.  Because they're blind. 
[03:08:00]  B-L-I-N-D.  Yes, of course.  All right.  That didn't justify a bell.  Do we have that?  We're looking for that.  Oh, boy.  Look at poor Bill.  Bill, please.  You're supposed to have that in Dillette.  Bill is scurrying.  He's all frazzled in there.  You know what Bill is?  Remember what happened with the Exxon Valdez?  Captain Hazelwood went to sleep, and they put this other flunky at the helm, and he steered 
[03:08:30]  right into something.  That's what Bill is.  He's the flunky steering into things.  Captain Derek is asleep.  Yeah.  Captain Derek is asleep.  Everything should go smoothly.  You can handle this.  Dan?  What's going on?  Huh?  We're looking for it.  All right.  If you find it, bring it to our attention.  Derek's kicking back with his mandals up, crust.  Yeah.  Mandals.  Ugh.  Still trying to figure out who's supposed to plug in my headphones.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:09:00]  He's not fessing up.  You're a good man.  You're not a rat.  I like that.  Vanessa Manilo.  Ugh.  I'll find out, though.  Hot piece of ass, but ugh.  Remember she did the fat suit?  It's sweeps week.  Did Vanessa do that for MTV?  She already did, right?  Yeah.  She used to bang Dirk Jeter, and now she's...  No, I know.  She's a friend of yours.  Vanessa, yeah, I know her.  Stop it.  You do not.  Yeah, I do.  I don't care if you did.  You did a pilot with her, right?  I did two pilots with her.  Two pilots with Vanessa.  And when we came back on, she gave me a great interview and gave us great plugs. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah?  When we came back on the air, yeah.  Where?  We were doing the Hammerstein back in 2004.  Oh, good.  Well, now we're going to bash her.  She was very nice.  Now we're going to tear her apart.  Yeah, because she's kind of full of herself there, Jimmy.  I don't blame her.  She wore the fat suit back in the day.  I think that was a year ago.  That was the latest rage.  Was that kind of the first fat suit?  No.  I don't know.  Who did the first fat suit?  I think Tyra.  Oh, yeah.  Tyra?  Was the innovator of the fat suit?  God, I hate that.  Yeah.  I think so.  And then all the TV shows did it.  Well, it's sweeps week, so they're breaking out the big guns, the big stories. 
[03:10:00]  Pull out the fat suits out of the closet.  Yeah, all the stories that make us watch a little longer so they get some nice ratings.  Who's she doing it for?  Remember Sweeps, it's called.  Well, you know there's a show called Ugly Betty?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's all the rage, I guess.  Because the girl is supposed to be ugly?  Right.  Is that it?  How about someone that watches the show?  She works in either the fashion industry or something in the beauty industry. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, fashion industry.  But she's ugly, and that's kind of the irony of the whole show.  But the truth of the matter is she's kind of funny-looking, cute, like it's not ugly.  If they want a real ugly in there, they could put real ugly in there.  She's got, like, braces and stuff, and she's kind of, like, dorky-looking, but she's not, like, hideous.  Yeah, we could find ugly.  Yeah, you could find ugly.  It's Hollywood's version of ugly. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, she's kind of, it's funny-looking, cute, is what it is.  It's like, you ever see girls that are funny-looking?  Right.  But they're kind of something about them that's kind of cute in a funny-looking way?  Like, they usually have Down syndrome.  Yeah.  Cute, ugly.  See, look, she's like on a Lisa Loeb kind of, and the braces help because it makes her look underage.  Yeah.  That's Hollywood's version of ugly.  Yeah, that's Hollywood's version of ugly right there.  That's as ugly as you're allowed to be in Hollywood.  My version of ugly would be...  Oh, my version of ugly would be a waterhead with patches of hair missing. 
[03:11:30]  There you go.  Why not have that?  Why not have that as part of Ugly Betty?  Have the fucking Snapple woman.  Yep.  Have her as that character, because she is, like, really kind of heinous.  Or a burn victim, and put that stupid, a skew wig on us.  But Hollywood...  That freaking burn victim wig, you are just fixated on it, and I can't get enough of it.  How can you not be?  The hairlines can't blend in, because...  There's just no way. 
[03:12:00]  How do you blend a hairline into jerky?  It just doesn't work.  You look like a thumb with a little wig.  Wear a baseball cap, you silly goose.  They do, usually.  The wig under the baseball cap is a good look, too.  It just looks horrible.  It looks like you're piling things up on a chair.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is some great video here, Than, coming in from one of our fine, faithful listeners.  They helped the program big time.  Thank you, Johnny.  We'll look into that. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  So, yeah, that's Hollywood's version.  Now, someone's got to help me out, because I think I took a peek at this show one night.  Ugly Betty?  I think.  There's a show out there, and I'm not sure if it's Ugly Betty.  Maybe someone can help us out, now that we're talking about this, because I think it would  give us hours of radio.  There's a kid, and I think it's on this show.  I'm not sure if the kid is, like, her younger brother or what, but he's obviously gay, and  he's no more than 12 years old on the show.  And I think they play it off like he's a gay 12-year-old. 
[03:13:00]  Like a gay kid?  It's Ugly Betty.  It is Ugly Betty?  Do we have that?  All right, you get on, Mike, Roland.  Wait, everyone's excited running in here.  Do we have audio of this, kid?  Roland, sit down.  No, no, go.  What's going on?  Go.  Roland, go.  Roland and Ugly Betty, kid, go.  Sam Hayek, the exec producer of the show.  Who?  Sam Hayek.  Oh, Jesus H. Christ.  Jesus H. Christ.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Roland washes his shirts in vanilla soap.  He smells so good.  Does he?  Smell like a candle?  I want to fuck his shirt. 
[03:13:30]  By the way, Snap Man from Whack Bag wants to get a new show on the air called Crispy Betty.  Exactly.  She always looks surprised.  She refuses to have anything with vinegar in it.  Jimmy, Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station, already reading the Jimmy Norton article in Steppin' Out magazine.  Of course.  You can only get it here in New York City, so we'll get it online for the rest of the country.  Make sure you read it.  Fast Freddy writes, Jimmy in Steppin' Out, burn victims look like a lemon with hair.  Oh, did I say it in Steppin' Out? 
[03:14:00]  I said that on the air once, too.  I quoted myself.  I can't stop with the poor burn victims.  I'm sorry.  You do smell like a Yankee candle.  Oh, my God.  It's great.  Wow.  So who's the producer of that show?  Salma Hayek.  Oh, I think he almost got it.  Salman?  Edward Norton used to hit that.  My pal Edward.  Did he?  I don't like him and Jeff Ross talking.  Like fuck her or just hit her?  Hit her, hope.  Because I hope, yeah, the latter of the two.  Roland, you look like a South Park character.  Oh, Jesus.  That ain't right. 
[03:14:30]  So Salman...  Yeah, Salman...  Salman Hayek.  Salman...  Salman Rushdie.  Yeah, Salman Hayek.  She wrote the Satanic Versus.  Right.  What, you had bad fish?  Nothing.  I didn't get it.  Salmonella.  Oh, Salmonella.  Take care of that.  Thank you, Ed.  And I was feeling all good about myself today.  Yeah, we all got it.  We'll be right back down to the zero.  Oh, I appreciate it.  So, Roland?  All right, Roland.  So, who produces the show? 
[03:15:00]  Salma Hayek.  All right.  And what's the show about?  It's basically like the ugly Betty girl wants to work in the fashion industry.  And she goes to, like, a Revlon-type company and becomes assistant to the president of  the company.  Assistant to the president.  But is she really ugly?  Like, she's not ugly.  Yeah, she dresses ugly.  But she's not, like, ugly.  No.  She's Hollywood ugly.  Funny looking.  A lot of people don't understand that.  Cute.  It's the worst show ever, I think.  Is?  Oh, what's wrong with it?  Critique?  It's horrible. 
[03:15:30]  Like that.  Well, like a reviewer would have to say why.  How about you give a little review?  It just, it's a boring show.  It just, the reason why people, I'm not sure why they like it.  All right, what's up with the gay kid?  Why don't you like it, though?  Yeah.  You can't say, I'm not sure why people like it.  Why don't you like it?  I saw two episodes, and it just was, it just, they pushed it too hard.  Like, she's ugly.  She's Hispanic.  Do they bring up the fact that she's Hispanic?  Oh, yeah.  All the time?  She wears, like, a freaking, like, white vera, whatever the Mexicans wear. 
[03:16:00]  I mean, I'm Hispanic.  I don't know what the Mexicans wear.  They wear, like.  Oh, look at you.  Look at her.  She got all nervous.  It's like, I'm Hispanic.  Are you Hispanic?  Yeah.  Full?  Yeah.  Where, where?  My mom was from Guadalajara, and my dad's from Spain.  From where?  Guadalajara, Mexico.  Guadalajara.  Guadalajara.  Guadalajara.  Hey, listen.  I got to give, I got to give Joel McHale credit.  That's where I saw it, because I'm like, I don't think I ever actually saw this stupid  show.  It was on The Soup.  He makes fun of it.  I love The Soup.  And the kid's name is Justin, and he does a segment every week called Gay 
[03:16:30]  Justin.  That's where I saw it.  Do we have The Soup from this past weekend?  Oh.  We could give Joel McHale a great plug, because it was hilarious.  And he's gay.  But is he, does he know he's gay?  Is it like the little kid from Who's the Boss?  Who was gay, and you knew he was going to be gay when he was like eight years old?  But were you clueless back then, because you didn't think they would actually have a gay  character on TV?  Nah, he was, at that age, you knew.  You went like, whoa, this kid's going to be so gay.  But they try to hide it in that show. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, in that show they did.  That's what I'm getting at.  I think in Ugly Betty, they don't try to hide it?  No, this kid is gay.  Wow.  Is he gay?  The big kid now from Who's the Boss?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  So gay.  So gay.  Couldn't be more gay.  Way gay, Jimmy.  Couldn't be gay if he tried.  No.  Never saw cock, he didn't stop, but at least talked to.  Jimmy, if he was any more gay, he'd be straight.  Well, you know, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Denise in Jersey.  Hey, guys, how are you?  Hey.  Hello.  That guy is totally gay.  I mean, he's obviously not having sex, but the story behind the show is the girl got  hired because the president of the company at the fashion magazine is a total womanizer  and his dad's grooming him to take everything over, so he needs a secretary that he won't  bang.  It's basically the story.  And the little gay kid prepped her for a job interview with, you know, going through  the magazine like, look at this designer, and he was totally telling her how to dress. 
[03:18:00]  I mean, he is so flaming, it's not even funny.  Uh-huh.  Well, listen, we're going to get, we're getting gay audio.  Sam's working on that right now.  Okay, and Roland's review sucked, by the way.  Really?  Of course it did.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, he's terrible.  He covered it all.  Yeah.  Roland, you didn't like, what do you think of the gay character?  I just saw like one episode.  Ugly Betty.  That's the beginning of the first piloting episode.  Let's see.  I'm trying to find other pictures of her to see if she is, uh... 
[03:18:30]  Sam, you got audio ready?  They gussied her up.  God damn, you're that damn good.  Give yourself a race.  What?  No.  Why not?  No, she gave himself a fiery.  That's a very ugly picture.  It's not our thing.  Oh, is that the gay kid?  Yeah, it's got to be the gay kid.  Is that this?  Jesus Christ.  Let me see.  That's got to be the gay kid.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the kid.  Could you get the Joel McHale thing?  Because that was pretty damn funny.  He should get a plug for what he's doing on that soup. 
[03:19:00]  And then there's like Hot Chick, and rumor has it they're working on a bit for us for the soup.  Yeah, he is working on it, and then once they get a bit, I'll email it to you guys and send a crew over.  Yeah.  Borat funniest movie ever?  Yeah, it's like the funniest movie in the past five years.  I went and saw Borat last night.  You liked it?  I liked it.  It can't live up to the hype that it's getting, but there were some massive laughs in it, yes.  And I realized at the movie theater that I am completely out of my mind, and I've got to do something about it. 
[03:19:30]  Wow, sure.  Dude, I purposely do not go to movie theaters that are filled, because I can't stand one thing that happens in the movie theater.  You want to guess?  Talking.  Cell phones.  That's easy.  That stuff's easy to me, believe it or not.  Because I know, for the most part, they're going to shut up when the previews start, because they make the previews nice and loud.  Popcorn crunching.  Dude, right through me. 
[03:20:00]  You know how we talked about, like, when I was growing up with the vacuum cleaner?  That's something, you know, the fans have a lot of fun with it from time to time.  I go to a phone call, and there's a vacuum playing, and you see me cringe.  I don't know what it is, but it goes right through me.  Yeah.  The same thing with popcorn.  There was a guy right behind me, and then you hear the whole theater.  We've talked about this.  It sounds like locusts.  Termites.  It's so annoying to me that, like, I can't sit in my seat.  Do you?  Like, I can't even, like, I can't even, like, block it out. 
[03:20:30]  I try everything.  When you watch movies at home, do you have to constantly be shoving shit in your fucking mouth?  No.  How come when you go to the movies, everyone feels compelled to just sit there the entire time shoving nachos and pretzel bits and fucking popcorn and everything else in their face during the entire movie?  And who the fuck decided that popcorn is the thing to eat at movie theaters?  Why couldn't it have been something soft, like taffy?  It's a little soft steak. 
[03:21:00]  Something nice and soft.  Sushi.  I don't give a shit.  Sushi.  Something that doesn't make noise.  But someone invented that and decided popcorn needs to be eaten.  Noisy food.  So, for the first half hour of the movie, all through the previews and at least a half hour of the movie, that's all you hear.  And I, it drives me insane.  Dude, insane.  I didn't even notice it, to be honest with you.  Lindsay was sitting next to me and she could tell, like, she looks at me like, you are a fucking weirdo.  And I'm, like, trying to be cool and, you know, and I can't, I can't sit there.  I can't stand the movies.  Cannot fucking stand going. 
[03:21:30]  For all different reasons.  And that's one of them.  But, you know, Borat is all the rage, so I'm trying to be up on pop culture, so I'm, like, I gotta see this movie, you know, soon instead of waiting a month when I'm finally in.  I go into the theater the day before they take these movies out for good, when there's, like, me and, you know, five other people in there.  Did you go to the one by our house?  Yeah.  Our house.  Yeah, they have it there.  It was really good, but I can't, the popcorn, it drives me.  And then the packaging on the candy is second to the popcorn.  Constantly, I know.  Well, it's 2006, why can't we get packaging that opens up easily? 
[03:22:00]  Stealth packages that are quiet.  Next time you're at a movie, you know, block out everything else and just listen for popcorn eating.  And people will do that during the quietest part of a movie when there's, like, whispering conversation.  Wait for, like, a big action scene with a lot of gunfire or something, and then open up your shit.  Oh, boy, are we, like, picky.  But, honestly, go to a, no, go to a sold-out show where the theater is packed, and right after the previews, when it gets really quiet just before the movie starts, try to, like, just listen for popcorn sounds. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, no, I know.  You'll be amazed.  I have.  It sounds like Locust.  Was it crowded in the theater?  Yeah, it was packed.  Oh, nothing better than a crowded theater, too.  It was packed.  But, uh, I don't know what I was getting, oh, Borat, yeah, but the nude wrestling scene could be one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  That's all I'll say.  I love the cockroach scene, though. 
[03:23:00]  Why?  Why?  Why?  Cock in it?  You're making me laugh, though, that's all.  Oh.  Did it.  All right.  You saw the Will Ferrell movie?  Yeah, that was really good.  That looks really good.  It's about what?  Stranger in the Fiction.  Emma Thompson is an author.  She's writing a book, and the character she's writing about is Will Ferrell's character. 
[03:23:30]  Will Ferrell character.  All right, let's go to Andy in New Hampshire.  Andy.  Andy, hey.  I was just calling because I'm a new listener, and I guess you guys talked about the eating in the movie theater.  It's like one of the times that I turn your station off for a few minutes is when you guys are eating,  and it's apparent I can hear chewing when I'm listening.  Yeah, I'm trying not to eat as much on the air.  Me neither.  Writing to Mike, because I know how annoying that really is, because I listen to it on the replay,  and even though I'm listening to myself eat, it drives me nuts.  Does it? 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  And I'm like, wait, ass, it's you.  That's you.  You can control that part of the show.  Don't do it then.  Right.  I'll be in the gym listening to the replay going, oh, my God, that is annoying.  All right, here's the gay kid from Ugly Betty.  Guess who I am.  Why, you're a proud member of America's Navy, sir.  No, I'm Gene Kelly from all the town.  Well, let's just tell everybody at school you're a sailor, okay?  Fine, but I'm a sailor that can sing and tap.  New York, New York, get all of it sound. 
[03:24:30]  The Bronx is up and the battery's down.  New York, New York, you're all of it sound.  And dance break.  That's a boy?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to just fuck him already.  There was a question about this.  I thought it was a girl.  There was a question about this?  By the way, that's the voice Sam hears in his head talking.  Whenever Sam thinks, that's the voice he hears.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a boy. 
[03:25:00]  And I want to thank The Soup and Joel McHale, because that's where I was turned on to this thing.  He's also our phone screener.  There he is.  There he is.  Lovely Travis.  So, Vanessa Manilo's Sweeps Week.  See?  We bring her right back around.  We'll look at that.  She's in the ugly suit.  Why?  Because, you know, Ugly Betty is that damn popular right now.  What network is she doing it for?  Um...  From TV?  Oh, boy. 
[03:25:30]  Entertainment Tonight.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Yeah, of course, she gets real ugly, gets a little fatter, throws braces on.  And, of course, she walks around New York, and people are pointing and laughing.  And I'm telling Ant before the show today, no one does that in New York especially.  No one turns and looks at an ugly...  Well, maybe sometimes on our walkover.  But we're performing for people.  But in our regular lives, no one does that.  No one cares.  No one sees an ugly person and has something to say or a chuckle or something. 
[03:26:00]  We see them all the time.  No one.  And what they failed to mention with this piece, because she's getting the reaction she wanted,  like, basically saying, if you're ugly, you don't get as, you know, the right attention  as pretty people do.  But she looks ridiculous.  It's obvious that she's, like, in makeup and stuff and made to look ugly.  Yeah.  That's what they're looking at.  But then they show the reactions and make it sound like it's because she's ugly.  It's like, no, they're reacting that way because you look ridiculous.  Like if you're dressed in a...  You look like you're in a Halloween costume. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, I was just going to say that.  Like if you're dressed in a vampire suit, or like Frankenstein, and walked around, people  would go, hey, look at him.  They'd notice because you're dressed like fucking Frankenstein.  Right.  You want to get a really, really good reaction.  Again, I hate to bring it back to the old BVs, but we're going to talk about Burn Victims again.  What?  I didn't hear you.  Oh, Burn Victims again?  BV.  Let's call him BV.  Yeah.  A Burn Victim.  Put him in a fedora with little round John Lennon glasses and put some, like, really bright  red lipstick and then give him an ascot. 
[03:27:00]  And a smoking jacket, ironically enough.  People look at him for a half a second.  Then they're like, eh, whatever.  So, entertainment tonight's not a network.  Give me a break.  All right.  Here we go.  So, Vanessa's in the ugly suit. 
[03:27:30]  And, of course, you know.  She learns a little lesson.  Yeah, I guess.  Don't they always?  She gets ignored at a high-end store, a hip club, and a busy park.  Well.  Right now, something else not to be missed.  Our own Vanessa Manilo has been going undercover.  It's an investigation for E.T.  And, Vanessa, watching what I've seen, it has to have been tough.  It was tough.  You know, millions of people tune in every week.  It has to be tough.  It's always so tough.  Tough for who?  Why is it tough?  You're a hot piece of ass in real life. 
[03:28:00]  How is this tough?  You know that isn't you.  It's like dressing up for Halloween and saying, it was so tough.  Is she not on MTV anymore?  She's all over the place.  I have no idea what this broad does.  Huh?  I really want to have sex with her.  Oh.  I think I could have.  Yeah?  No.  Get out of here.  I was just humoring you.  Of course you couldn't.  You didn't believe it?  No.  Not for a second.  I was trying to do some of my acting for you.  By the way, your article's online. 
[03:28:30]  Is that okay?  Or you want people to go to the newsstands?  Because we got people all over, you know, America.  Go online and read it.  Steppingout.com, is it?  Or SteppingoutMagazine.com, I believe?  No, gee.  Can someone take the exclamation points out of it, please?  If we post that, OBNathony.com, remove the exclamation points.  Remove every exclamation point from Jimmy's side of the story.  I think it's Stepping, no G, Out Magazine.  SteppingoutMagazine.com.  Okay, so let's get back to Vanessa, getting ready to wear the ugly suit. 
[03:29:00]  It was tough.  You know, millions of people tune in every week to see Ugly Betty and the less than perfect  girl try to turn the tables on New York's beauty elite.  But what we want to know is how could a real so-called Ugly Betty survive in the real world?  So I went undercover with padding and special effects makeup to find out.  They are the stairs.  The stairs.  The sideway glances.  That's more of a visual.  The quick looks up and down.  Yeah.  Armed with five hidden cameras and transformed into Ugly Vanessa. 
[03:29:30]  I was virtually invisible at a high-end Madison Avenue shop.  Yeah.  Shunned at a hip New York City nightclub.  Yeah.  And for the most part, ignored at a busy park.  Can you do some?  Okay.  Excuse me.  Every single guy is turning me down.  What'd she want to happen at a park?  I can understand.  The club ain't going to let you in because you're fucking fat and ugly.  And you look like a ridiculous thing in a fat suit. 
[03:30:00]  That's what clubs are all about.  They let the pretty people in.  They let good-looking people in.  The hipsters and shit.  You don't get in.  A high-end clothing store.  You're not going to be able to wear anything in there.  Why is a salesperson going to waste their time with you when they can make their commission on a skinny broad?  And then a park.  What was she expecting?  What the fuck is she expecting?  Attention?  And then you hear the laughs.  They were laughing because you look like you're in a Halloween costume.  You're in a fat suit.  Yes.  With fake braces and fake awful hair. 
[03:30:30]  My transformation for this...  Oh, this...  Oh, yes, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  BV joke?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that you should get a BV and to give him two diamond earrings and a monocle.  He couldn't hold the monocle in.  You need, like, an eyelid. 
[03:31:00]  You look like Mr. Peanut.  Vanessa almost cries...  Vanessa almost cries in this clip, guys.  Right?  Because why?  It's so tough.  Well, because she's going to wear buck teeth for the piece.  Buck teeth.  Yeah.  And she almost cries, even though she could just take them out and...  Yeah, pop them out.  She's back to being a hot piece of ass. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  But she almost cries.  Okay.  Because that helps the story along now, doesn't it?  My transformation for this expose is extensive, including a fat suit, prosthetics, braces.  On another day, I also go blonde, trying to attain what some feel is the ideal of beauty.  But that's another story.  Black eyes.  Today's story begins here.  It's 5.30 a.m. inside Manhattan's DVD-Pot.  Even before the special effects wizards of Almost Human began their work, my emotions are close to the surface. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, my God.  What do I think of?  I think of 7th grade and getting made fun of.  We all have those awkward years, and for me, it was definitely junior high.  See, you're laughing at me.  They're already laughing at me.  And now I have to go to the beginning.  I kind of feel like I'm really getting emotional.  I'm getting upset.  I cannot look at it.  I can't. 
[03:32:30]  Last time she was made fun of was junior high?  Junior high, and she can't even take the thought of being made fun of, even though she's in a fat suit.  She's so fucking self-centered and beautiful and knows it.  Sorry, it's your pal, Jimmy.  But Jesus Christ, lighten up, bro.  Beautiful people that try to look ugly.  You know, it's like, come on, you're not really experiencing it.  I can't take it.  And she can't believe the looks and stuff she's getting, but then when she's out of her ugly suit, 
[03:33:00]  she only dates people like Derek Jeter and Nicholas Shea, Norton, and Jimmy Norton, almost, and his dream.  Edward Norton.  Is she dead, Edward Norton?  Oh, I don't know.  Someone is saying that.  Oh, no, I thought you said.  Oh, that was the other broad.  Sam Hayek.  Yeah.  Who?  Sam Hayek.  Yeah, of course.  Janitor Pants from Wackbag.  This would have been great if the ugly suit caught fire and melted her face and body.  Do you know what I want to do?  I want to walk up to a fat person and just say, take off your fat suit. 
[03:33:30]  But I don't have one.  Take it off.  It looks fake.  You couldn't be this fat.  Who are you?  What star?  Where are the cameras?  Yeah.  Well, she had to sit in the makeup chair for six hours to get ugly.  Six hours.  That sucks.  Yeah, that's got to really suck, huh?  Sitting in the makeup chair is a tedious six-hour process.  The task?  To apply all the things that fit the stereotype of what is ugly. 
[03:34:00]  We've altered my neck, lower part of my face, and nose as well.  Let me show you the profile.  I'll bump up my nose.  Bushy eyebrows, bad skin, freckles are meticulously dabbed on, then the frizzy dark wig.  Finally, a fat suit to add some pounds.  Struggle.  Putting on pantyhose.  But you know, these are Spanx, which are amazing to suck in, regardless of what size you are. 
[03:34:30]  I actually wear them underneath evening gowns as stuff for events.  Holy shit.  This is the clip that will get a reaction.  This is the clip that will get a reaction.  Even from Jimmy.  Even though he doesn't want to trash his friend.  Okay.  What size is this?  This is a 12. 
[03:35:00]  Looking at myself in the mirror, I knew I wasn't the most perfect girl, but I was still me on the inside.  And I was going to protect my inner beauty and win.  Well, that didn't quite happen.  There's your pal, Jimmy.  She still has inner beauty.  Yeah.  Thank God.  Her vaginal canal.  The old money maker.  That's good to protect your inner beauty.  I agree.  I agree.  Does she really think she has inner beauty when she's walking around as a hot piece of ass? 
[03:35:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, that isn't what people are looking at when she's at the club in a scantily clad outfit.  Right.  She's just dancing around, looking all hot.  You think it's inner beauty?  People are coming up and talking to you because of your inner beauty?  Stop it.  Because you're a hot piece of ass.  So when you get in the fat suit, no one's going to come up to you because they can't see the hot broad under the fat suit.  Can I tell you, by the way, that on the webcam, Roland looks like just a creature. 
[03:36:00]  The angle is so bad, Roland.  And I assumed it.  And the lighting is real bad.  Oh, it's awful.  You have jaundice.  You're looking like I'm a monster.  They're yellow.  It's all just your head and your arm.  Yeah, yella.  Yeah, yella.  It's just, look at this.  It looks like you're wearing shoulder pads.  It looks like you have a hunchback.  It's terrific.  All right.  But I was still me on the inside.  And I was going to protect my inner beauty and win. 
[03:36:30]  Well, that didn't quite happen.  I guess they'll make fun of me.  Clearly, bad hair.  And my clothes are too small.  And, yeah.  Great.  Awesome.  This is going to be great.  So that's the important stuff they're doing on entertainment tonight to get people to watch.  Simple as this.  She looks like she has a Halloween costume on, and that's why she's getting reactions. 
[03:37:00]  Not because she's ugly.  Do we have a picture?  Of her fat suit or her ugly suit?  Her big fat suit.  I don't think so.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We're trying to get more gay kid audio.  And then we'll do line of the day.  And then we'll make fun of Roland some more.  I want to talk nicely to Roland.  And maybe one more BV thing.  BV bit?  Maybe...  BV line?  BV thought?  Maybe one more BV thought from old Jimmy Norton, who will be at the Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night. 
[03:37:30]  This is a cue, Bill.  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay you down and give you a little bukkake?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Gay porn.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place?  The slutty or the better. 
[03:38:00]  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  You're welcome.  Uh...  Uh...  Uh... 
[03:38:30]  Uh...  Uh...  All right.  That is the weirdest music to come back to.  That is a little odd.  Where did that come from?  I don't know.  More gay kid audio from Ugly Betty.  Thumbs up, Sam.  Yeah, is it gay, Sam?  It's pretty gay.  The audio is a little low, but it's pretty gay.  It's gay.  Is this from The Soup?  Yes.  All right, very good.  ABC's breakout hit, Ugly Betty, is being hailed as a breakthrough for ugly Hispanics everywhere. 
[03:39:00]  But I think the real breakthrough is Betty's little brother, Justin,  who's figured out his place in the world much earlier than my funny Uncle Bruce.  So, was the club amazing?  They say people wait in mind for like three hours just to get inside.  Was there any famous people there?  Did you bring me a matchbook?  Justin, I forgot.  Well, what about the bathroom doors?  Did they really fog over with them?  Justin, I didn't have to use the bathroom.  Okay, Justin, we'll get ready for bed.  And by the way, I read your boss's first issue. 
[03:39:30]  A little bulky, but good balance of style, accessories, and puff pieces.  All right, that's a little gay.  There I see.  It was him.  That's a little gay.  It's really disturbing to watch, and I can't explain it.  You've got to see it for yourself.  I haven't seen it.  We're back on the air.  We have someone to tell us I was doing something with Steve in the production.  Yeah, don't you worry about it.  All right, what do I know?  You, Steve, production room. 
[03:40:00]  Show drives itself.  We were manning up.  Takes time.  Whatever you've got to do.  Want to play a little roulette?  Yeah, what's that?  All right.  What?  This could be a problem.  Oh, no.  Or it might just be a fart.  Push it out.  Be aggressive.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  I crawled back up.  It's a lemon.  No, it was turtling. 
[03:40:30]  You've got to be a man at that point and take the hit for the team.  Hey, why is Laszlo here today as we get ready for line of the day?  Laszlo, what do you do with Tim?  He brought in high-res photos of our O&A.  Ah.  Ah, yeah.  Hey, is this online yet?  I think we talked about this earlier this morning.  Here's what?  The caricatures that we are in GTA.  That's you as the...  It's not quite a caricature.  Well, what would you call it?  Caricature would be if it looked like you, only exaggerated. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, you're right.  And here is Opie the cop.  These are actually up on Foundry Music.  Well, that's kind of a caricature.  My favorite that I think you'll enjoy, if you want to pass this to...  By the way, go to opieandanthony.com so you can see what we're talking about.  But basically, pretty much all of us do voices in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for the PSP.  And, of course, you know, they had to make characters of us.  And they're very interesting.  And they're all labeled nicely on opieandanthony.com so you can play along at home.  The... 
[03:41:30]  I don't even know how to describe the E-Rock character that you're looking at.  The gay jogger.  Yeah, E-Rock plays a gay jogger in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.  He looks like a slightly balding, like, guy in his 40s that would try meth just to get his libido back.  I like his little red wristbands.  And, of course, we have Nathaniel as the fat...  Old guy with the pink shirt.  Right, who hates black people. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Steve, the golfer, came out quite well.  Yeah, definitely.  That's good.  He has a bit of a golf posse.  So if you mess with Steve's character...  Oh, you mess with everybody.  And, yeah, it's him and his homoerotic golf posse on the golf course.  And then, of course, we have Danny, who seems to be shirtless.  Well, Danny likes to be naked. 
[03:42:30]  I know.  Every picture I see of him from the Halloween parties wearing hardly anything.  Yeah, well.  Get his clothes off.  Very cool.  Yeah, the pictures are up on opieandanthony.com.  I want my bully cop picture.  Well, we sent him over.  Did you not get him?  No.  We will get you 8x10s.  I'd love to have him.  Nice.  They're posted at the website.  I want to frame it and put it up in my apartment.  There's one of you as the cop and bully looking longingly at a young lad.  Yeah, I want to see that. 
[03:43:00]  Show my girlfriend.  Go, hon, that's me.  You should go, really?  How many pictures are on your wall?  I put my cock in her mouth.  You have enough space on your wall for anything.  Did you say girlfriend?  Yeah.  Is that back in...  I thought that was over.  I don't know.  Don't even try.  To figure it out.  Don't even try.  No, I don't have a lot of my stuff hanging up, actually.  I got a lot of stuff I still have to hang up.  Yeah, you'd be very disappointed.  I'm sure I would if I was ever invited to your place.  You've been invited many times, but you always reject me.  Never been invited.  Do you want to come over later?  Never been invited.  Oh, what are you doing later? 
[03:43:30]  You want to come over to my house?  I can't, I'm busy.  Can we get Roland back in here before we leave?  Is that Jimmy and Bully?  Boy, that looks just like the high, uh...  Wow.  The high res we just got.  What did they, like, wrinkle it up?  Jesus.  It's got a crease in it.  It's been crumbled.  Where's the young lad?  It's a...  It's a...  I think they went old school.  Yeah.  Facts of Jimmy's character.  Facts.  I know.  I printed that on a dot matrix printer.  Yeah, there you go.  I will make sure that you get a high glossy photo, Jimmy.  Thank you, sweetie.  Roland.  I brought in the camera. 
[03:44:00]  What do you have with you, Sam?  Roland?  Camera.  Camera.  Camera.  Camera.  Anything else you want to tell us today?  Razzle dazzle.  Anything else going on in your life?  Oh, uh, it's my birthday.  Happy birthday!  Oh!  Happy birthday!  Is it your birthday?  You piece of shit!  How old are you?  27.  Happy birthday, Roland.  Who knew?  I didn't know.  What are you going to do for your birthday?  Uh, I have meetings tonight.  It's, um, celebrating with my friends on Saturday. 
[03:44:30]  What are you going to do?  What?  Oh, we're going out to a bar.  Can I go?  Yeah.  You're coming Friday, right?  Yep.  Okay, as your birthday present, um, I won't cock whip you.  So, what else do you do for your birthday?  Uh, drink?  Drink.  Um, go to a bar and have dinner with my buddies.  Talk about old times.  Go see a couple more movies.  A couple of movies on your birthday? 
[03:45:00]  Well, how many hours are in this night?  We're going to go to dinner, go to a bar, and go see a couple of movies.  What is a fucking birthday weekend in Europe?  Why don't you just pick one thing?  Selfish.  You can only stare at beer taps for so long, and then you've got to do something else.  A long time, though.  We're going to go, uh...  Spare at them for a while.  See eight movies, and then two dinners, and a dessert.  Two dinners, and...  That's, uh, terrific.  Well, happy birthday.  Thank you.  How did we not do anything for Roland's birthday?  We did.  I know. 
[03:45:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, Roland.  Happy birthday to you.  What do you have, Arthur?  Fucking...  What's wrong?  You got everything? 
[03:46:00]  You like the old lady in the commercial?  It's Friday-wide.  There you go.  What kind of cake is that?  I don't know.  That looks good.  Thank you.  Let's have a...  What do you think?  You didn't make it.  Let's have a piece.  Yeah, like...  Why don't you share some birthday cake, Roland?  It's nothing selfish.  Those fucking candles.  What kind of cake you guys are, Roland?  It's a shit candle.  Huh?  It's chocolate, I believe.  What'd you grab that from the fucking Savage Deli downstairs?  Get an ice cream cake.  Like, this cake eats my ass.  Hey, Ope, why don't you take a look at that cake?  I'm not turning into Gallagher. 
[03:46:30]  You guys could try, but I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not turning into Gallagher.  I don't want to be a one-trick pony.  Hey, earn this cake.  I earned that for my birthday.  Oh, I know.

Now, I'm talking they were between 10 and 15.  Yeah.  So they're butting, and they're all holding their bathing suits up.  They thought it was cool because it was getting dark out, and they could take their bathing  suits off.  Why'd they call you Mrs. C?  Is that your name, or what you act like?  Mrs. C is my name.

[03:53:30]  Hey, can I hear that Kick in the Cunt song?  That's a timeless classic.  Derek, we have that set?  All right, here it is.  Kick in the Cunt.  Jack Black.  Jack Black.  There are several ways to irritate a lady.  That's awful.  You didn't mention that a rat's gone out of style.  He's not putting his all in there.  And they're sure to get in there.  It's bound to cause a tip.  But here's a little...  You're going to keep our mics on?  ...the extra...  Give her just a little kick in the cunt. 
[03:54:00]  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a nice kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stump if you go for the punt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  Now, a lady of grace won't show utter distaste  for a slur or a randy suggestion.  But if you call her a whore,  it may do nothing more than make a subtle change in her complexion. 
[03:54:30]  So give her a kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  Ah, kick in the cunt.  That's about a lovely kick in the cunt, eh?  If you ain't to annoy,  there's no better ploy  than a rousing good kick in the cunt.  Now, you might want a sucker  or clopping the choppers,  a shocker for making a grabber and knockers,  but she'll pull the coppers and you'll end in jail  where you eat red and water and shit in a pail.  So if you've enough of a womanly guff, 
[03:55:00]  no need to be rough,  it'll be quite enough  to call her bluff  with a huff and a puff  to stuff your foot straight into her muff.  Just a no-fashion kick in the cunt.  A kick in the cunt?  A kick in the cunt?  That's about a nice kick in the cunt.  You'll sure have a stump  when you go for the cunt  with a jolly good kick in the cunt.  And there you go.

Okay  It's the moose bit  Well  E-Rock  What's the bit about?  He already  It's about that time  That moose went through the windshield  What windshield?  Of a car  Like a child  Huh?  Yeah  It's the E-Rock is a dummy show  Here's the moose bit  Tim  Hey guys  What's up?  I was just saying 
[04:08:30]  If you guys heard about that  That car accident  Over up here in Boston  About the president  The moose  Some dude  I think it was a girl  I think it was a moose  Oh my god  I know what you're talking about  I think it was in yesterday's paper  Saturday's paper  Some girl on the highway  Outside Lemonster  I have no idea  I'm trying to be local  For the people in that area  Sorry  Yeah  And the moose  I don't know how it happened  But the  Crashes  Or whatever  Yeah sorry  That blasted the moose  And the moose  Ends up  Sitting in the passenger seat 
[04:09:00]  With its head  Out of the windshield  Looking around  And it couldn't move  And they had to kill it  Because they couldn't  You gotta see this picture  It's one of the greatest pictures  You'll ever see  Woman crashes into moose  Goes through the  Yeah right through the windshield  And all that  And exactly what he said  The moose is sitting  In the passenger seat  With the head sticking out  Wow  Of the  Of the windshield  Like it was  That's how they were driving  The whole time  Do you  Do you know how much  She must  Do you know  I've yelled in my life  But do you know  How much you scream  When one minute 
[04:09:30]  You're listening to the radio  And the next minute  A moose  Is sitting next to you  With his head  Through the windshield  You would have to have  A hard attack  Especially if you got  A ticket for not having  A belt on  If we can find the picture  I meant to bring it in  We should have scanned it  For the website  It's unbelievable  And then they had a crane  To try to get the moose  Out of the vehicle  And unfortunately  It had a broken hit  For some  They had a  They had a  You're kidding  They had to do that  Euthanization  Euthanization  And then they have to  Shoot the moose  In your car  They have to kill a moose 
[04:10:00]  In your car  And then drag his carcass  Back through the windshield  And it's gonna really hurt  The ring scale  And you know it's shit  You know the moose's shit  All over the car  Shit all over before he died  Hey we got the papers  From the weekend  In the office  We might have it in there  Oh okay  Fucking poor moose  Is walking along  Next thing you know  You're sitting next to  A screaming fat lady  In Boston  P-Rook  Nothing up my sleeve  Where's the rest of this moose  We must have hated that moose  Why don't you forget  The moose  Arthur  We got the pictures 
[04:10:30]  Of the moose  Sitting nice  The moose looks  Ridiculous  What an ass  This moose looks like  It's like  What goes through the moose's head  What happened  What happened  What happened  Windshield  What happened  What a goose this moose looks like  Look at him  He's got a light in his face  All he wanted to do  Was eat a berry  Next thing you know  He's fucking in a Fiat  He's a fucking asshole bleeding  How silly does that moose look  That is a silly looking moose 
[04:11:00]  Can somebody tell the moose  The car doesn't fit you  Mr. Moose  Look at me  The moose has too many friends  That are afraid  That's like Tom Cruise  They're too afraid to tell him  You look like a silly goose  Mr. Moose  Mr. Moose  Wouldn't it be fun  To hit the washer  And watch him go  Like shake his little moose head  Like the last thing  That could possibly annoy him  Is a little jet of water  In his face  I would hate to have that moose  In my car  Because he puts right  To the windshield  If it rains  It's going to get all over the place 
[04:11:30]  And plus the moose  Probably goes duty  All over the seat  And you have a wet moose  Do you know how scared  The moose must have been  I just thought the car  Was still driving  And someone actually saw this  Taking place  Before she finally slowed down  I would find the nearest toll booth  Right  They shot Mr. Moose  In the causeway  He's dead  Look how they massacred my moose  I hope one guy  As this moose drove by  It was a little high 
[04:12:00]  Yeah  I hope there was one  A little high person  That went right to an N.A. meeting  Because he saw a moose  With a vehicle  Oh my god  You don't even have to be  A little high  I hope it was just  A carload of people  Completely sober  But only one guy  Saw it past them  And had to tell  His friends  What he saw  And no one believes him  No I did  There was a moose  In the passenger seat  Shut up stupid  Shut up  And his face was hanging out  The windshield  I swear to you  That's mean  It was probably just  A boy with down syndrome 
[04:12:30]  No I'm telling you  It was like Dino  He looks like Dino  Yes  It looks like Dino  In Fred's car  I feel horrible for the moose  Because his little  His moose arms  Are all jammed up  They're folded under himself  He can't even open  The glove box  Poor fucking moose  He's probably so scared  And in pain  And in shock  But look it's an accident  So I mean  If I were her  I would have jerked off  On the moose's head  That's what I would have done  If I showed up  I just would have  Because no one  In recorded history  Has ever jerked off  Onto the face of a moose 
[04:13:00]  As it sat in the passenger seat  Of a car  No one  Now Jimmy  We have to research that  I'll bet you  Somebody's raped the moose  I'll bet you  Some farmer  In Canada of course  Climbed up  And fucked a moose  After he hit it  No one's ever jerked off  On the face of a moose  While it just sat there  And took it  And there you have it  The moose bit  Haven't heard that in a while  Very funny bit Jim  What was funny about it?

[04:22:30]  Hey, could you guys play Andrew Dice Gay and the Bedazzler?  We can do that for you. What are you doing today?  Working.  Working.  I'm at work calling right now.  And they let you listen to this at work?  Uh, I haven't really been caught yet, so it's not really an issue yet.  Good for you.  Stop with the dodgeballs already. I get it.  No, no, no. Keep throwing them at him.  All right. Andrew Dice Gay. Here it is.  Andrew Dice Gay.  A little cock in the ass never hurt no one.  All right? 
[04:23:00]  Can we get some gay music for Andrew Dice Gay today?  I like why a man can't change over the years.  I used to talk about the broads all the time. Remember?  I sure do.  Do you remember?  I sure do.  The time when I used to say,  I'm standing on line at a bank,  and I got my tongue up this chick's ass,  and everyone would laugh.  That's a classic Dice line.  It's classic.  Now it goes more like this.  All right.  Hit it. 
[04:23:30]  So I'm standing on line at the fag bar,  and I got this guy's cock in my mouth,  and he shoots a load of cum into my mouth,  and I go,  Thank you.  Now can you fuck me in the ears?  Oh, I can dance.  I can jive.  Yeah, I'm having the time of my life.  Oh, see that cock?  Stick it up your ass. 
[04:24:00]  Look at Dice the fig.  You hear me?  I fuck you now.  His cum, it was so dick.  It was like chowder.  Hard to swallow, yet pleasurable.  You hear me?  I hear you, Dice.  Back when men were faggots.  Back in the old days.  I love ABBA.  I like the village people. 
[04:24:30]  Those are fun fags.  You got some village people.  Yeah, I love this one.  Oh, oh.  Everybody.  Young man, stick it right in my ass.  Young man.  There's no need to feel down.  Dice, any thoughts about Brokeback Mountain?  I love that movie.  There's cowboys who are rugged, right?  Yeah.  Yet they're fucking faggots. 
[04:25:00]  They're sucking cock,  ass fucking,  yet they go to town and have some beers,  like men.  Why can't men be like men like that there?  But they're ostracized.  Or fucking an ostrich.  One or the other.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  It's fun to know that Dice is gay.  Dice is gay.  Everybody, how do you make a D?  With the arms. 
[04:25:30]  I'm a fucking faggot.  Dice is gay.  I'm gay.  I love it.  It's raining men.  Can you pull that out of your ass?  To make room for my cock.  Oh!  Oh!  We hear you.  I blow you now.  It's raining fags.  I want to go out when it's raining men, right? 
[04:26:00]  Pull down my drawers.  Do a handstand with no fucking umbrella.  It's raining men.  Chism in my ass.  Oh, gosh!  Andrew Dice gay.  Did we drill this into the ground enough?  I don't think so.  It makes me laugh.  It's almost like old school.  It makes me very happy.  All right.  So I'm with this guy. 
[04:26:30]  I shouldn't tell a joke while I'm sucking cock.  It's something new I got to learn from being a fag.  Joke, then suck the cock, then joke.  You do it the same time.  Hickory dickory duck.  The cum interferes with the punchline. 
[04:27:00]  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Little Miss Muffet sat on the top at eating.  A cursing wave.  Right.  Along came a spider.  A net a face full of cum ruined my fucking joke.  Oh!  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby. 
[04:27:30]  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the notep.  Oh!  Ooga-loo-galoo-galoo, ooga-loo-galoo, ooga-loo-galoo.  Ooga-loo-galoo, ooga-loo, ooga-loo, ooga-loo-galoo.  I'm over here now. 
[04:28:00]  If I gotta have that,  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it  Just look at me like a chick with balls  He's a jack-o-pitch-point-to-sick  He's a scumbag  Nice-y-nice
