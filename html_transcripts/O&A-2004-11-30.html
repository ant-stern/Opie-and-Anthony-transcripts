<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts reminiscing about past workplace antics, specifically their infamous 2002 sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral, quickly transitioning into vulgar and sexually explicit conversation.  They complained about their new, overly friendly security guard, preferring the previous "mean drunk ex-convict." The discussion then shifted to their broadcast schedule and the potential for relocating their studio to a warmer climate like Nashville or West Palm Beach to improve listener engagement across time zones.  They briefly alluded to a problematic show from the previous Wednesday, hinting at potential repercussions, and mused on their cyclical three-year job changes.  A significant portion focused on their negative experiences with NYC taxi drivers, detailing aggressive driving and frustrating detours. They briefly touched upon Robert Chambers' return to jail and their own brushes with speeding tickets and vehicle inspections.  A call with a former parking enforcement officer revealed the incentive structures that encouraged excessive ticketing. Further listener calls detailed quirky NYC ordinances and anecdotes of abusive city employees.  The segment ended with a sexually suggestive music mashup.

The show continued with a caller's explicit request for sex, seguing into a discussion about racial prejudice and anecdotal experiences with racial bias.  Humorous anecdotes followed, including a bad IHOP dinner and a gas station encounter.  The hosts discussed hanging up on uninteresting callers, leading to a discussion about an XM radio "MyFi" contest.  Numerous listener entries, many sexually explicit and vulgar, targeting Rich Voss, were read. Voss was then called into the studio to participate.  A listener offered to divorce his wife on air; another offered disgusting acts involving Voss's bodily fluids; and a female listener proposed a three-way in the studio.  Movie theater dangers and annoyances were also discussed, including violent confrontations and disruptive behavior. A listener offered to fight Master Poe in a UFC-style match for a MyFi. A tense moment occurred when a caller, unaware the broadcast was live, angrily confronted the hosts.

A tense, comedic exchange with Master Poe, the show's bodyguard, followed.  The segment focused on Poe’s past legal battles (a hurricane and divorce), used to deflect questions about his fighting abilities.  Despite a caller’s challenge and the hosts' prodding, Poe insisted he wasn’t there to fight. Opie and Anthony teased and antagonized Poe, creating a volatile atmosphere with crude humor and implied threats.  They read and discussed absurd New York Post headlines, focusing on sensationalism and a lack of sensitivity, particularly regarding Dick Ebersole’s son’s death. Listener calls further escalated the tension with Poe, with one caller accusing him of fabricating his legal battles.  Musical interludes, including Richard Cheese and an Eminem/No Doubt mashup, were interspersed with listener calls covering various topics.  The segment ended with continuing tension between Poe and the hosts, the possibility of a fight, and a mention of a MiFi giveaway.

The show then started with a discussion about a fart, transitioning into a conversation about dangerous children's toys.  The hosts listed toys, making dark and offensive comparisons to real-life tragedies and child abuse cases (Joel Steinberg, Katie Beers, Andrea Yates).  They discussed the double standard surrounding teacher-student sexual relations.  Listener calls added to the morbidly humorous list of dangerous toys. A caller recited lyrics from "Silence of the Lambs: The Musical." Marvin the Trucker criticized the show's humor, leading to a heated exchange with the hosts, who insulted him.  Further listener calls suggested more darkly humorous toy ideas, and the hosts reminisced about dangerous toys from their childhoods (lawn darts, click clacks, etc.).  They also discussed a potentially fabricated news story about a father unknowingly hiring his daughter as a prostitute.  The segment ended with a song.


Finally, the show opened with Stephen Lynch's "Gerbil Song."  A call-in segment followed, where listeners shared what they learned that day.  Comments ranged from neighborhood observations (including offensive stereotypes about Jewish and Indian people) to personal anecdotes (a cyst on Opie's back, flatulence in the studio). Several callers referenced recurring characters or inside jokes, such as Master Poe.  A large, unpleasant fart and its lingering smell were discussed. Jimmy's upcoming performances were mentioned.  A picture of Sophie Monk from the FHM Lingerie World Tour 2004 distracted the hosts. The show concluded with more listener calls, jokes, and promotional announcements for XM satellite radio.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you.  You got a couple of great guys over there.  Hopi and Anthony have cost their bosses a lot of money. 
[00:06:30]  Yay, man!  Hold a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral back in 2002.  We've learned our lesson, right?  Yeah, we have.  We've learned our lesson.  We're reckless, arrogant, stupid dicks.  I would like to extend to you an invitation to the passport.  Get your cock out.  You know the Holocaust?  Uh-huh.  Picture the exact opposite of that.  Wow, that's really nice.  That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, vile...  What kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:07:00]  V.O.B.  Ananthony show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker.  Cool.  He looks at vaginas all day long.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  He looks at vaginas all day long.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You keep your hands off of my mule.  You would have an enormous schwanstucker.  Have you seen my wiener? 
[00:07:30]  What, you mackers?  Why don't you stop playing with yourself, will you?  Do you know what a boob is?  Boys have a penis.  This girl's have a vagina.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hey, good morning, everyone.  Hello.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:08:00]  Thanks to the fine folks at XM Satellite Radio.  We're having the balls to hire Anthony and I.  The balls.  The balls.  Oh, my God.  Wake the fuck up.  What?  You all right?  I'm fine, actually.  You got up at 315 for some reason.  315?  315.  That's stupid.  It really is stupid. 
[00:08:30]  I just push it.  I push it later and later each day.  I'm starting to notice that, actually.  I love...  Me?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm in here every goddamn day before you.  I actually beat you to work today for once.  And I live, what?  A mile away.  You live 25 miles away.  I signed in and I had to write 5 a.m.  And I saw you signed in and it was 5 a.m.  So you must have gotten in about a minute before.  No, actually, I'm too lazy to look at the watch.  I write 5 a.m. every morning.  It doesn't matter what time you come in.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:09:00]  Me too.  That's, you know.  And then we got a new guy downstairs.  I don't know if I like the new guy.  Controversy.  You like the new guy?  I don't like the new guy.  You know why?  He's lock the door guy.  Yeah, but he's a nice, friendly guy.  Don't care.  He greets you with a smile.  I like mean guy downstairs who keeps the door unlocked.  Mean ex-convict guy you like better?  Mean drunk guy.  Ex-con.  We don't know if he's drunk.  I mean, it does look like he may...  I'd say drunk.  ...hit the bottle here and there because, you know, he's his own boss.  But he keeps the front door unlocked. 
[00:09:30]  Now, nice guy is all smiles, which, by the way,  I don't like that in the morning either.  I'd rather have the grumpy guy at the door.  Then you don't have to put on that fake smile and go,  Hey, good morning.  I just go, like grumpy guy, I hand him my card.  I'm like, hey.  I give him a, hey.  And he's like, give me a card.  Yeah, give me a card.  Give me a card.  I sign it.  I sign the little sign-in sheet.  And I'm up.  I didn't have to ring the bell.  This morning, I'm outside.  Nah. 
[00:10:00]  Nah.  I'm ringing the bell.  And then the guy comes up.  He's all cheery.  Hey, good morning.  Good morning to you.  And then I got a plaster on a face.  I feel compelled to put on a fake smile and go,  Hey, how you doing?  Like, all of a sudden, I have to give this energy,  this performance, that I really don't want to do.  Yeah, well, all right.  So, me, I don't like new guy.  I want old drunk guy back.  Hmm.  I might be with you.  And you know how much I hate him.  I know.  You can't stand him.  But I need that door open so we can get right in.  Especially now that it's kind of wintry out there these days. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Here in New York City, anyway.  It's a national radio show.  This is a national radio show.  Why are we broadcasting in New York City in the middle of winter?  Well, it's not middle of winter, but it will be another month or so.  So, we've got to start planning now.  You want to go down to Florida or something?  We should definitely.  Why do we have to stay in New York City?  We don't.  Why are we broadcasting at 6 in the morning on the East Coast?  We don't.  We don't have to.  There's going to be changes in 05.  Lots and lots of changes in 05. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  This 6 to 10 thing doesn't make sense.  How about 7 to 11?  7 to 11.  Now, that'd be good.  An extra hour.  Extra hour.  And then maybe we can get the West Coast involved a little bit.  Because I'm getting emails from people bitching saying,  Look, man.  We're just not awake when you guys are broadcasting.  We would like to participate.  Yeah.  We get those sleepy people from the West Coast that call us.  Maybe we squeeze it and we go 7 to 11.  7 to 11 from where?  From West Palm Beach. 
[00:11:30]  West Palm Beach?  I don't know.  Somewhere warm.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be nice?  I've never been to Nashville.  I hear XM has studios in Nashville.  Isn't it warm there?  We do a week or two in Nashville.  But is it warm there?  Yeah.  Really?  It's warmer than this.  Yeah?  Yeah.  In the winter?  Yeah.  I hear tell it gets pretty cold down there.  How about we go to Vegas?  No.  Then one of us would die.  That wouldn't be smart.  Miami?  That's not smart either, Ben.  We know now.  Oh, Miami.  We know we have to kind of be responsible.  So we know we've got to pick a warm city that kind of has a nightlife, a little bit of 
[00:12:00]  party, but not too much.  Vegas, too much.  South Beach, Miami, way too much.  Tennessee?  Nashville?  Eh.  Yeah.  Might do the trick.  I think the responsibility thing that you're talking about might be encroaching a little  on the show.  What do you mean?  I've just noticed we're kind of thinking a little too much on this show.  You think?  Yeah.  It's kind of good, but it kind of takes away that.  How are we thinking too much?  I don't want to get into details.  How are we thinking too much? 
[00:12:30]  Are you insane?  Were you here last Wednesday?  Yes, I was.  And we were thinking too much?  But no, no.  Now, that's a pretty good example of how much we have to be thinking.  I just don't want it to kind of get carried away and us kind of, you know, well, let's  keep things in perspective.  I think we have.  Okay.  Let's do, I'm just, I'm not saying we haven't.  We, I'm not saying we haven't.  Let me get that straight.  I'm not saying we haven't.  We made some changes after Wednesday's show.  I know we did.  I think they were smart changes. 
[00:13:00]  By the way, the faithful listeners, they're not stupid.  Yeah.  They're all like, so why didn't you replay Wednesday's show over the weekend?  Yeah, I know.  Why did they play a show from November 19th instead of playing the show?  We know what the deal is.  Every weekend, you guys play all the shows from that prior week.  I'm not saying we haven't.  We have all the little, like, investigators and spies on the message boards.  They're all trying to figure things out. 
[00:13:30]  They're like, we know there had to be some kind of problem.  Yeah.  You won't be hearing this sound anymore.  What sound would that be?  Oh, let's just say a certain machine.  Don't worry.  We're not going to overthink things on this show.  Yeah, that's all.  That's all I'm saying.  I think a lot of us got a little paranoid after Wednesday's show.  Yeah, yeah.  I just don't want that to affect anything maybe in the future that we might, you know. 
[00:14:00]  And we want to be here a while.  Yeah.  We actually want to be here for a while.  Just for a while.  Just a little while.  Well, I don't think we'll make 10 years at XM Satellite Radio, but...  You don't?  But three or four would be nice.  You don't think we'll make 10?  10 years here?  Yeah, I don't think so.  Holy ass.  Are you kidding me?  We haven't made 10 years anywhere.  No, we make about three years at every place we go.  That's it.  That is true.  Why is that?  Our shelf life is about three years.  Three years, and then we start to rot.  Actually, any W, we made four years. 
[00:14:30]  That was good.  Did we make four?  Yeah, we made four.  Yeah, we signed a three-year deal, and then we signed our big deal, and we made it a year  into that deal, and we got canceled.  I thought it was only three.  No, we made four, which was a new record for us.  So we were really robbing.  There are radio guys that just spend their whole careers in one city, one station.  One station.  We're just assholes.  We just...  We are.  We really are.  God.  It would be nice to just have a long-lasting career at one place. 
[00:15:00]  Imagine 10 years at one place.  You're coming in.  You go to work.  You leave.  You've been there 10 years.  Everything becomes pat.  Right.  You just know your commute in every day.  We just throw our careers in chaos every three years, and then have to start over.  Start all over.  I think it makes us work a little harder.  We've got to adjust everything.  Our lives get thrown up in the air.  10 years, you could just...  You could go through it asleep.  You could call...  You could just call in the show.  Call it in every day. 
[00:15:30]  Call it in.  Just sit here and do the same old crap over and over again.  The entertainment value to the listener is just the fact that you're there every day.  Mm-hmm.  It doesn't even matter what the hell you do.  No.  Does that dream come true or nightmare?  I don't know.  But we're here at XM Satellite Radio.  We couldn't be happier.  They're still taking their time getting things together for us, but eventually we'll figure  it out.  Are they?  I haven't even noticed anymore.  Well, we want these cameras on.  They got these stupid cameras so they can take a look at us down there in Washington.  So we're like, well, if they're looking at us in Washington to see that everything's 
[00:16:00]  okay, I think they're trying to, you know, spy on us to see what time we leave after  the show's over.  Oh, you think?  Oh, yeah.  I think, I like the ones they have in the elevator.  They catch me like picking gook out of my eyes every morning.  And you don't notice until you look in the mirror that you're picking in and you see the  camera there.  Right.  Those are working.  But these cameras should be online for the fans.  Yeah, that way you could check in.  We asked about that, I don't know, a month ago easily.  The office is almost complete now that we've been here for two months. 
[00:16:30]  Maybe it's because of things like Wednesday's show that the cameras are on.  I don't know what you, let's not talk about Wednesday's show.  Ixnay on the end of Wednesday.  Wednesday never existed.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We were on Thanksgiving vacation.  That's right.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  There was another Opie and another Anthony doing the show Wednesday.  Yeah, the same Opie and Anthony that.  Does anyone take cabs to work, by the way?  Oh, oh.  Who's raising their hand in here, Ben? 
[00:17:00]  I almost saw a four-car pileup because cabs, does this happen to you guys?  They get so aggressive at this time of the morning because there's no fares out there  and they've got to make their money.  I'm scared to raise my hand.  At the end of my block, I raise my hand, get the cab, and I shoot down here.  It's like literally two, three minutes.  But I have to make sure there's only one cab in the distance.  Oh, really?  And I forgot today.  So I raised my hand.  There were three cabs and then a delivery truck.  The delivery truck was in the middle. 
[00:17:30]  And all three cabs are going as fast as they can and making hard lefts to the left side  of Columbus Avenue to try to pick me up.  There was almost a horrendous accident just to pick me up.  Cars skidding and everything.  A white guy at this hour with blonde hair?  You know what a rarity you are, though?  Yeah, right?  For a cabbie?  What a treat?  Oh, he doesn't have to worry.  Yeah.  He could just pick you up and take you there and know he's going to get his money.  An happily-cheeked blonde boy.  One car.  No gunfire involved.  The car that won, you know, stops, I mean, jams on the brakes. 
[00:18:00]  The other cab missed him by literally an inch.  And I'm sitting there, like, horrified.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not...  It was unbelievable this morning.  And then the guy's like, get in!  I'm like, whoa.  I think I might just walk to work today.  You get the same thing?  Yeah, you get three fighting.  You always got to wear your seatbelt, too.  I have a friend that's a dentist.  At least once a month.  Just a slam, boom, you go into that partition.  You knock your teeth out.  Plexiglass partition is just a tooth extractor.  But it's crazy what they'll do to get a ferret this time of the morning. 
[00:18:30]  I actually like to wait until I see one that's five lanes over,  and then I stick my alabaster hand up,  and I watch him just shoot across.  Shoot across five lanes of traffic.  I'm hoping one of these animals is paralyzed.  Trying to pick up the tipping white man.  And the black guy in the Santa hat today was my cabbie.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, black dude in the Santa hat.  Oh, now they're dressing up, trying to get their tips.  I yell at these guys, too, because some of them try to take the long way. 
[00:19:00]  I'm like, dude, it's 4, whatever, 4.45 in the morning.  I'm not a tourist, obviously.  I'm going to work.  What are you doing?  How do they try to take you?  Like around Columbus Circle?  No, they try to shoot down, I guess it would be 8th Avenue.  8th Avenue goes up.  9th Avenue.  9th Avenue.  You go down 9th Avenue.  Yeah, and whatever.  For people in Alabama, they don't care.  Well, as you said, they're trying to take the long way.  Well, there's an obvious way to get to where we broadcast, 57th and 6th Avenue. 
[00:19:30]  And some of them like to shoot down 9th and then cut over,  which adds a little money to their fare.  I'm like, how desperate are you for money?  I yell at these guys every morning.  And right at that moment where it's obvious they have to go left,  I'm always screaming, because 50-50, they want to go straight.  It's like, it's so out of the way.  It's not even funny.  It has to go on.  It's explosives.  Yeah.  Every dollar counts.  You're going to be having a big Christmas party at your 54th floor penthouse apartment  this Christmas? 
[00:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  Nobody got that?  No.  54th floor?  Yeah.  He got it.  Anthony got it.  Oh.  I don't know.  That was bad.  54th floor he lives on?  I don't know.  What are you doing, Ben?  I don't know.  I don't know what you mean, Ben.  Ben's doing schtick.  I'd like to go to a party.  Ben was very confident in a step up to the mic and blurted that out.  And then I blurted that out like a pro.  I ain't even dressed for a party.  Went nowhere.  Awful.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  What happens if I'm at the party and I'm putting salami in my pocket and the woman 
[00:20:30]  goes, don't steal it?  I'll go, but if it's free, I ain't stealing it.  What happened?  You're like, I slept on a banana peel.  That's the greatest one in Midnight Cowboy.  They don't want to know what happened to his bum leg.  All right.  Oh, Ben.  Well.  I didn't get it.  I'm like, yeah, sure.  I'm telling you.  I was making a joke because remember the last time Opie had his little football party  and we talked about the party and now he's talking about a neighborhood.  Even worse.  Yeah.  But seriously, if you're having a party, I do want to go. 
[00:21:00]  I like Christmas parties.  All right.  Maybe I'll throw a little party.  I don't know.  You really should.  A little soiree open?  Why not?  B-Y-O-T.  It's a bring your own table.  I'm getting new stuff every day, by the way.  Are you?  Oh, yeah.  What do you have that's new?  Well, you help me get the computer.  That'll help.  I got a posture-pedic mattress to go downstairs so I can sleep in the cave because people keep  me awake.  You know, you go to bed at 8, 830 and you get pissed off at the people still walking the  sidewalks and the cabbies driving down your road and stuff. 
[00:21:30]  And also, I got homeless guys that like to sleep outside my window for some reason.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And they just babble in languages you've never heard before.  You got to get the...  Because I don't want to explain where I live, but it's a perfect little nook for homeless  guys right outside my bedroom.  You got to open up the window, especially in the winter?  No.  Cold water.  Cold water?  Pour it right on them.  They freeze up.  They'll leave immediately.  Got to go find a subway grate to defrost on.  I don't know if you're going to attempt to homicide the winter. 
[00:22:00]  It's just homeless.  Scalding water in the summer.  That's a homeless guy.  No one will notice.  Why don't you just go out and pay?  No one will notice.  Take your mule out and do a little docking.  All right.  What are people talking about this morning?  Nothing, right?  The preppy killer is going back to jail.  Well, that's what they're saying.  The prosecution wants to put him back in jail.  Found some coke and some heroin residue on some tinfoil and a straw in the backseat  of his car.  You know, I don't like this guy any more than anybody else does. 
[00:22:30]  Do you want to tell the people in Tennessee who the preppy killer is?  It was a nice story, I guess.  Yeah, anyone that remembers back then will know who it is.  Other people might not know because they just don't remember.  But he was involved in some rough sex.  In Central Park.  In Central Park.  And strangled this Jewish broad.  Some Jew broad in this day and age.  Yeah.  And strangled her.  He said it was rough sex they were having.  Others said that he just strangled her.  And he went to jail for 15 years. 
[00:23:00]  15 years.  Got out.  Just got out.  Less than a year ago, right?  Did his sentence.  Or is it a couple years ago?  No, less than a year, man.  Okay, less than a year ago.  And when you get out, you know, you got to be good boy, which doesn't include doing coke and heroin.  So they found this and they're trying to send him back to prison on it.  Yeah, I don't know about that residue thing.  If you catch somebody with a bunch of drugs in their vehicle, fine.  Do what you want.  Put them in jail, whatever.  I love watching cops and they get these people, morons that are doing like 85, 90 miles an hour. 
[00:23:30]  They get pulled over.  They come out sweating bullets and shaking.  The cop goes, you mind if I search your vehicle?  Well, I really.  Why?  There's nothing in there, officer.  And I'm laughing my ass off because you know what's coming.  They pop that trunk open and they're pulling kilos out of the trunk.  And you're like, why is this bonehead doing?  Why isn't he just doing 55 miles an hour?  Why does he have a taillight out, not using his blinkers and doing 85, you know?  That's fine. 
[00:24:00]  Take him in.  He's a moron.  And obviously he's dealing the drugs or something.  If you get some residue on a piece of tinfoil,  what business is it to arrest somebody like that?  Yeah.  You know?  They're saying most of the money has cocaine residue on it.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  You got some 20 that wants to curl up at the corners.  There's probably some coke on it.  But the preppy killer, he was driving without a license.  Inspection.  Inspection.  And he had a suspended license because of a traffic ticket he hadn't paid.  Who hasn't done that?  Why is he driving around like that with drug paraphernalia in his car? 
[00:24:30]  He's nuts.  He's stupid.  He just got out of prison.  So if you're someone like that, it's pretty stupid because you're going to get sent back to prison  because everyone wants to send you back to prison.  The newspapers are putting you on the cover trying to get that outrage going.  They're trying to get the froth going so people will get pissed off.  We know how that works.  They put your picture on the paper.  They do it a couple of days.  They put some nasty stuff underneath it.  And then you're the scourge.  Yeah, they come up with cute headlines like opie and dopey. 
[00:25:00]  Opie and dopey.  Church sex scandal.  Yeah.  Things like that.  And it gets people, what?  Well, I never.  And they get outraged.  And then the public officials feel compelled to do things because they think the people are outraged  because it says on the paper that the people are outraged.  So you get someone like the preppy killer.  They put his face on the cover a couple of days.  They rekindle the outrage of him killing that young girl.  And then the public officials feel compelled to throw him back in prison. 
[00:25:30]  So that's what they're going to do.  They'll throw him back in.  For how long?  I don't know what he can do for that.  A couple years, maybe?  Maybe.  At least a year.  And you brought up something as we were preparing for the show.  I did?  They showed the video?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  When he was on probation for the...  He was out on bail.  Right.  Awaiting trial for killing Jennifer Levin.  Yeah, what am I saying?  Out on bail.  And he went to a party.  And at this party, there's a videotape rolling.  And this is back in the old days where, you know, you had a big bulky camcorder on your shoulder. 
[00:26:00]  And I guess people just did it because it was kind of a novelty.  And he picked up a doll.  And he started twisting the head around like he was choking this thing.  And he was imitating the doll's voice going, my name is...  And then he almost was going to say Jennifer.  The girl that he killed.  And then he decided.  He goes, no, no, no.  And he put the doll down.  Well, that thing ran like crazy on A Current Affair and all those tabloid news shows that were all the rage back then.  And it really got public opinion against him. 
[00:26:30]  And again, the outrage and the public officials and everything really pushed to get this guy put in prison for as long as they could.  Right.  And I was like, you know...  Well, last night they showed the video again.  Yeah, yeah.  They keep showing it.  And I think you said, why would he be so stupid to film something like that back in the day?  Right.  And I told you, you know, back in the day, people did that stuff all the time thinking there's no way anyone would ever put this on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  But now, I mean, you know, these TV shows are just searching for any type of homemade video, you know. 
[00:27:00]  But back then, you didn't think twice that it would actually end up on TV.  That was probably one of the first videos, you know, outrageous videos that ended up on one of those shows.  That did start that trend of the news shows and even the news now using just people's videos in the news.  But you're right, back then, it was probably just them hanging out at a party, figured they would tape it, show it to their friends,  or it would just sit on a shelf somewhere like so many people's home videos do. 
[00:27:30]  And then it ends up on the news, and there he is choking this dog.  So he really made him look bad.  So he's effed.  Without a doubt, he's effed.  And then, oh, you know, speaking of dead bodies, do you watch The Coroner?  Oh, by the way.  You watched The Coroner?  I watched it last night, actually.  You did?  All right, we're going to talk about that.  What were we going to say?  Just talking about things that, I don't know if we even talked about this yesterday, that I got out of another speeding ticket.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  And this goes with the stupid people that do stupid things when they're driving. 
[00:28:00]  But it's kind of working out for the better.  Remember a while back I talked about my inspection on my vehicle?  I picked up a brand new vehicle in August.  And decided not to get it inspected.  I have not gotten my vehicle inspected.  But don't you, when you buy a new car, isn't it already inspected for you?  No.  For like two years, right?  No, it's registered, but it's not inspected.  Why?  You have to go and get it inspected.  When did that change?  I don't know.  I thought you didn't have to for two years.  No, that had to change.  When you drive a car off the lot or whatever, it's already inspected. 
[00:28:30]  No.  It's not inspected.  I have to go get it inspected, which I have always, for years, I've been stupid with this.  I never get it inspected.  It doesn't have an expired inspection sticker next to the Reggie, mind you.  It just does not have an inspection sticker.  It's just my Reggie.  No, it's funny.  We are so similar.  And I hate doing regular crap.  Yeah.  Stuff that everyone does.  Yep.  We will avoid.  We will avoid.  It has nothing to do with who we are.  No.  I've been like this since I was 18. 
[00:29:00]  I once got arrested.  It's the only time I've ever had handcuffs on and been arrested for driving with a suspended license.  It was suspended because I hadn't paid a ticket for inspection, which I didn't get.  I got an uninspected ticket.  I let it go and go and go.  This was years and years and years ago.  So, I'm driving upstate over the weekend, and I get pulled over because I'm speeding.  I come over the hill. 
[00:29:30]  There's the cop.  I'm like, son of a bitch, man.  Woo!  Get the lights.  Pulled over.  He goes, you're doing 85 in a 45.  Nice.  Nice.  It's one of these roads upstate where it's 55.  Well, they do that on purpose.  It's those speed traps.  All of a sudden, you're on a highway, and all of a sudden, it becomes a small town.  And you don't notice the town because it's nothing.  There's a couple of houses and a shack.  Yeah.  You don't notice the difference.  Nothing changes. 
[00:30:00]  There's no traffic lights.  There's no general store or anything or gas.  It's just the same highway, but all of a sudden, it's like, welcome to town of speed limit 45,  even though you're still on the highway.  I know.  They do that just to get some income for the town.  It worked.  Guy comes over.  Now, I am one of the nicest guys to pull over ever.  I'm not combative.  I'm not an idiot.  What I do, the first thing I do, pull over immediately.  I don't make him work or think. 
[00:30:30]  I don't give him a thought in his head like this guy's running or something.  Pull over immediately.  Flip on the lights in the vehicle.  Sure.  Now, he's got a clear view of the inside of my vehicle.  You turn down the stereo, right?  I turn down the stereo, and I put my hands on the steering wheel.  Now, he sees my hands.  The window's already down.  And I turn my head, waiting for his arrival at my window with his big mag light.  And he comes up.  He's like, how are you doing tonight?  Turn. 
[00:31:00]  Good officer.  Yourself.  Yeah, fine.  You know how fast you were going?  I was like, sir.  I hate when they ask that.  I hate that.  I know.  Look, we both know what happened here.  You don't have to belittle me.  Yes, I know I was going 85 in a 45.  It's coming over the hill.  And, yeah, I really, I was going.  And no one knew you were going 85 miles an hour uphill.  Yeah, I was.  So you couldn't even use the excuse like, whoa, you know, it was a downgrade.  And I didn't really realize that I was going much faster. 
[00:31:30]  Sure, I usually keep it at 60.  I topped the hill at 85.  I guarantee you did.  I've been with you.  So I said, officer, I said, really, my license is clean.  I go, I really would like to keep it that way.  I have no points on it.  And if there's anything you can do to help me out there, I'd greatly appreciate it.  And then he takes the mag light, and he goes over by my inspection sticker, where it's supposed to be.  And I don't have one.  So he goes, oh, no inspection. 
[00:32:00]  I go, yeah, lazy.  I haven't gotten inspected.  What an ass I am.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  Give him the license, Reggie.  He goes, oh, we'll see what we can do.  He comes back after a while with the uninspected ticket.  He goes, look, I let you off the hook.  I'm speeding.  He goes, just watch yourself, especially around the towns.  And he goes, you know, guilty on the inspection thing.  He goes, if you decide to fight it, he goes, we're going to have to meet in court.  And I'll start telling people in court why you were pulled over in the first place.  I go, no, I'll pay this.  Believe me, don't worry about it. 
[00:32:30]  So then I'm starting to think, I'm never going to get my inspection.  Because it's the out the cop is looking for.  Anything he can use to keep from giving the worst ticket, they usually do if you're nice.  So if you're uninspected, he's going to opt to give me the uninspected instead of the speeding.  The speeding ticket.  All your police paraphernalia didn't help you on this one?  I don't have it.  It's all expired.  That's what happened two years off.  I've been off two years.  I don't have crap left.  I mean, I laugh when people come up to me and go, hey, you want a PBA card? 
[00:33:00]  Or, hey, look what I got from my friend, a PBA card.  I'm like, ha, ha, ha, PBA cards.  You should see what my friend Anthony has.  I had a window placard.  He had placards.  I think you have the siren on top of my car, the bubble.  You have a siren.  You've got a police uniform, I believe.  I mean, hey, whatever worked, officer, I'm on the job, too.  PBA cards.  Ha, ha, ha, I laugh at you.  PBA card.  We got little sergeant pins.  We got all sorts of stuff from our buddies at the NYB day.  But now.  But all that expired?  Yeah, it's all expired. 
[00:33:30]  I have nothing now.  Any officers out there want to hook me up with some stuff?  I had something from the bridge and tunnel cops right after 9-11 that got me through the battery tunnel, lower Manhattan.  And then I'd go in from Brooklyn, no one else except dump trucks full of debris were in and out.  And you pop out the other side, you know, it's the surface of the moon over there at that time.  And, you know, I was able to get into work on time.  Yeah.  Because that's the important thing.  That's what the tunnel should have been used for back then. 
[00:34:00]  Me.  I'm so selfish.  I also got a...  Really horrible.  I also got an expired inspection sticker ticket over the weekend.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  See, you're lazy, too.  Well, I parked on the street in my neighborhood.  And these asses, they have nothing better to do.  Starting at midnight, they just go up and down all the streets making sure everything is, you know, you got your inspection sticker and your Reggie is all up to date.  If you're parked illegally, that's fine.  That's what their job is.  But now they're going around inspecting your vehicle on the street? 
[00:34:30]  This is the second time it's happened to me.  I blew it last year and I blew it this year.  That's like if you lived in the suburbs, a traffic cop coming into your driveway and looking and saying, oh, he's unregistered.  Let me...  Well, you know, people like me that have their car in the city and park it on the street, yeah, that's kind of...  That is your driveway.  That's kind of my driveway.  It's your driveway for the night.  And, you know, and they're just walking up and down the streets just giving out tickets for, you know, inspection stickers that have expired, you know, registration stickers that have expired. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  How is that fair?  It doesn't seem very...  That's for sure.  But I got one as well.  Yeah, keep a...  So I say keep a little violation on your car at all times unless you're, you know, toting heroin and coke around.  Well, we have a cop on the line.  And he's going to explain to us why they ask, do you know how fast you were going?  Oh, we got an answer.  Dennis, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey, go ahead.  Hi.  All right.  The reason we ask you why you're going so fast for how fast you were going is because what we do is we back the ticket. 
[00:35:30]  So in court, we can say you admitted to going 85 and a 45.  Right, right.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and then the guys would go around and they give you, you know, unregistered vehicles and things like that and improper display.  I have an inspection sticker because we have nothing better to do, to be honest with you.  They have what?  You know, the guys, when your vehicle's parked and we come around and write you the tickets while your vehicle's parked.  Yeah.  Yeah, those are the guys we pretty much have nothing better to do with that.  He's got nothing else to do with that, Howard. 
[00:36:00]  But are those cops doing that or are those parking violation people?  Those are real cops.  They're violation asses.  Yeah, those guys are scumbags.  The ones who do traffic direction and everything like that are the worst.  In my neighborhood, I watch these scumbags and they are scumbags.  They will stand right next to a meter knowing there's like two minutes left on it.  And I have seen like women, you know, that are running on the sidewalk with their pocketbook knowing, you know, they time it out that they only have an hour or whatever.  I have watched this more than once, running to their car and as soon as that meter, you know, is now in violation mode, they're already riding the ticket. 
[00:36:30]  And there's nothing you can do about it.  Knowing the woman is running down the sidewalk and you know that's the woman that you're riding the ticket for.  They're wannabe cops.  And then the lady will beg and, you know, plead like blah, blah, blah.  And they don't even listen.  They're always these fat, uneducated messes that are just riding the tickets.  It's a power trip that they have over everybody.  They weren't good enough to get into the NYPD. 
[00:37:00]  They didn't want to exercise a little bit.  So now they're like, you know, you know that.  Yeah, they feel the power.  There's a lot of people out there that have stupid jobs that feel like they have all the power in the world.  Power position.  Power position.  Anyone, you can be the lowliest piece of crap with a crap job.  And if you have the best crap job around your group of people, you will play your power.  You'll play.  You got a power play and you're going to use it.  I call these guys scumbags to their faces all the time. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, they all the time.  They're used to it.  They sit there without that expression on their face.  You know, it's one thing if that car has been parked there, if it's been expired, even five minutes, you know, whatever.  But if it just clicks over and you run over and go, look, I'm leaving right now, don't matter.  Right.  That's what I'm talking about.  I mean, you know, they wait at the meters.  And then you can just stand there while they're riding it and berate them.  Call the women the C-word.  Say, you big, fat C-word.  And just, because that's the only enjoyment you can get.  They fired, by the way, that scumbag who bullied Mike Wallace. 
[00:38:00]  And that's the guy you want to fuck with.  The guy from 60 Minutes, you idiot.  And he got the boot, so that's nice.  There you go.  Mike Wallace was arrested.  How old is he?  86?  I think he's 86.  They cuffed him and put him in the back of the car because of this guy decided he had the authority to arrest Mike Wallace.  Mike Wallace for some parking mishap with his limo.  His driver's outside and Mike Wallace is getting a meatball sub or whatever he's getting. 
[00:38:30]  And they're getting a ticket, so he's like, Mike Wallace is trying to hustle along.  Try being a pushy old douchebag.  Yeah, you know how old people are.  Hey, I'm on 60 Minutes.  Can we move this along?  And the guy cuffed him because he was a danger.  So they fired him because they told him he had no authority to arrest anybody.  No.  All right.  Ticket people.  Why don't we take our first break?  We'll go to the phone and see what everyone's up to this morning.  Just getting started.  We have the MiFi thing that we're going to start.  Do we start this this week?  I'm all confused.  I don't know.  This week?  Next week?  Yeah.  We get confused with the weeks around here, don't we?  We get confused when the gang in Washington tells us things and then all of a sudden they're promoting it for another week. 
[00:39:00]  The gang in Washington sounds like the mob.  Whatever.  Hey, dude.  The gang in Washington wants their cut.  Oh, the big free play week starting, what, June 11th?  Jesus.  Yeah.  It's a real big deal.  And they're running promos for the wrong week.  Ouch.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  Just in case you're wondering, if you've got friends of yours that don't have the Opie and Anthony show yet, but they have XM, starting this coming Monday, so a week from yesterday, for the whole week we're going to be available for the whole XM platform. 
[00:39:30]  Okay?  And we've been talking about this for months, like, since we started, and all of a sudden they're running promos that it's starting, you know, a week after.  Yeah, I don't want to confuse people, but the 12th.  I'm like, how does that get, how does that happen?  Yeek.  But it's next week, starting Monday the 6th, right? 
[00:40:00]  So for the whole week we're going to be available for everybody on the XM Satellite Radio platform.  There you go.  It's just unbelievable, the incompetence at times.  I just got to say it.  It amazes me.  It absolutely amazes me.  I got to agree with you.  Well, we're the asses.  Because we complain about it, because we, you know, we are.  Because we want to, you know.  Sorry that we want to be on top of the radio world again.  Sorry we bother you with little minor details.  Well, that call today is going to be good.  We're going to have a little meeting today.  That should be fun. 
[00:40:30]  I forgot.  It's call meeting day.  That's right.  Where we all hustle into the only room with a conference phone, which is, it's a cell.  It's the 8x5 cell that we all go into to smell Jimmy fart.  Oh, did I gas in there last time?  I'm sorry.  All right.  We want to take a break, but there's a couple people on the line we should get to.  Sean on Long Island, what's up?  Nothing much.  Yeah, I know what you guys are like.  I did this for two years. 
[00:41:00]  Did what?  I quit when I got called every bad word in the album.  Oh, you were the one that wrote out the tickets for expired meters?  Yeah.  You scumbag.  That's right.  Anything else you want to call me?  Why did they call you names?  Were they ever legitimately right or no?  Were they just being babies?  No.  Guys like this will be, no.  You know, technically, you know, the meter ran out.  But how about human decency?  How about seeing the lady running with her little kid in tow, knowing that the meter just  ran out, and you sit there with an expressionless face writing the ticket right in front of her. 
[00:41:30]  She's begging for forgiveness and saying, please, please, please.  I kind of like that, actually.  Whatever.  Dragging that dumb kid down the street, bothering everybody.  That's right.  Bitch, stand there and take your ticket.  Hey, Sean, so you couldn't handle it, and you finally quit the job?  Well, I got called every last bad word.  Hey, Sean.  My job is done.  Hey, Sean.  Yes.  What kind of incentives were there by the management to write these tickets?  Were you given anything extra? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, you were given a little bonus at the end of the year.  Little bonus at the end of the year based on how many tickets you wrote?  Yeah.  All right.  So that's why.  So it's all, it's, it, what it boils down to then is, uh.  Quotas.  Yeah, quotas.  And, and the fact that these people want to make money.  It's their job.  So it's like, you know, if they gave you a bonus at the deli for making more sandwiches,  you'd be the fastest sandwich maker.  Make more money.  Of course.  So now I, I kind of don't feel as bad about these people.  What they're doing is, uh. 
[00:42:30]  I mean.  Making money.  Even to this day when I see them, I, you know, I still feel bad.  I mean, I just feel bad writing those people up.  They are scumbags, but at least they're doing it for the right reason.  Scumbags.  Cash.  So, Sean, what did you want to be when you grew up and then you turned into one of these  meter guys?  Uh, I wanted to be a cop.  I told you.  Why couldn't you make it?  I had bad knees.  Bad knees?  Yep.  All right.  What are you doing now?  I work with John Ed.  There you go.  All right.  Thanks, Sean.  Thanks, Sean. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  On it.  On it.  Uh, John in Georgia.  Slogan.  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  You tell us.  Let's go.  Well, you know that up there in New York, if you're sitting on a milk crate outside your  business or whatever, you can get charged a $25 ticket for misuse of a milk crate.  I know.  That has happened.  That's made the New York papers.  Also, you can't lay down in the subway.  If you take up two seats by maybe just leaning the wrong way, they'll give you a ticket.  Leaning the wrong way? 
[00:43:30]  Or taking up two seats?  Well, I agree with that.  Those mother...  They'll lay down.  I'm sleeping.  I love watching them getting rousted by the end of a nightstick.  We're not talking about the homeless guys.  We're talking, once again, maybe someone that just works 16, 18 hours or on the subway and  they're like, they got a long commute and they're like, what about the guy that's got  to stand up because he can't sit down?  I'm not even talking about that.  There's plenty of seats and it's just being, you know, these guys are just being a pain  in the ass writing tickets.  You know, obviously, you know, they don't need extra seats and this lady or this guy 
[00:44:00]  is just kind of leaning and taking up two seats.  They'll give you a ticket if they're in the area.  You know, there was a cop out there in L.A. that saw a woman driving with her knees, putting  on her makeup, talking on the cell phone, driving 80 miles an hour down the interstate,  pulled her over, started to write her a ticket, his pen ran out of ink and told her, well,  woman, this is your lucky day.  I don't have a pen to write you a ticket.  Hell, if I was that damn cop, I'd have borrowed a pen from her purse.  All right.  Well, that's got to be an urban legend. 
[00:44:30]  He doesn't write the ticket because his pen runs out of ink?  Yeah.  It made the paper.  Oh, it did make the paper.  Oh, it's got to be true.  They're in L.A.  All right.  He was trying to rape her, but he ran out of clear stuff.  Thank you, John.  Louie in Brooklyn.  What's up, Louie?  What's up, brother?  How you doing, man?  Pretty good, man.  They had nothing worse than standing in the streets of Manhattan with the trafficking  Americans standing on the corner.  You're asking for directions.  They can't even help you out.  Trafficking.  He just called up to get that in.  Trafficking Americans.  We did see them cause an accident, though, on 42nd and 11th or 12th. 
[00:45:00]  It's Lincoln Tunnel traffic.  So there's one lady kind of bumbled across the intersection, and the fat, dirty C traffic  lady made her back up all the way back over 42nd Street.  Oh, they love the power.  Back up.  Back up.  You know, mighty Joe Young just standing there.  Back up.  Back up.  So the lady backed up, and as she's sitting there, a taxi cab comes down 42nd Street, runs  the light. 
[00:45:30]  It's legitimately the cabbie's fault.  And smashed into this poor woman, who would have been across.  Right.  You understand, would have been on the next light already, if it wasn't for this fat pig.  And the old lady got the teeth knocked out, like Ben said, in the cab.  I don't make eye contact with the traffic people.  These are the people that are in the orange vests.  They're not cops either.  Nope.  They're the same people that write the traffic tickets.  And they stand in the intersection.  And they feel the power.  Especially during the holidays.  And wave on traffic.  They're doing the job that the light is doing above their head. 
[00:46:00]  There's a traffic light.  It's working.  But for some reason, they feel compelled sometimes to put these people in there, because I guess  they have nothing else for them to do.  And they wave the traffic on, stop it with the other side, and wave you through.  Whenever they tell me I have to stop, and that light is green for me, I go.  I don't listen to them.  I don't make eye contact.  I just go.  And I hear them yell, hey, what are you doing all day?  Hey, you're supposed to stop.  I'm going right by, don't care. 
[00:46:30]  Don't care, because it's a power thing.  They're like, yeah, the light's green.  Yeah, if I wasn't standing here, you would be going.  But you know something?  I'm standing here.  And I say stop.  For what?  For what reason?  They had no reason.  Yeah, just because that's my job, and I can do it.  And they usually wind up screwing up traffic more than the light does.  They're the worst.  They really are the worst.  When you're in gridlock, and all of a sudden you get there, and you see one of those traffic  people, you're like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Why is it worse?  Why is it worse?  Oh, they're just awful.  Because they're feeling the power. 
[00:47:00]  Yep.  They're feeling the power.  Cops will let you.  If you have an emergency, you're like, look, one time I was running late for a gig.  I had to get into the tunnel.  They know how they closed down lanes into the Lincoln Tunnel for no reason?  Yeah, no reason.  One of those traffic vultures will never let you through.  But a real cop doesn't need to prove he's powerful.  Right.  So I'm begging.  I'm like, can I go?  I got to get in.  He's like, all right, just go.  He was just so disgusted with my wormy groveling, as he should have been.  Another man.  Disgusted with you.  Yeah, my fat neck just shaking nervously.  Hey, I don't think we've ever taken a call from Kansas.  Let's say hi to Eric in Kansas. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, Kansas.  Hey, I got to tell you, you know, you talk about being pulled over and you're being  so conditioned to obey the speed limit.  One time, me and my cousin, we was coming back.  We'd hauled, and he was moving up to the central part of the state, and we was coming back to  this.  Why was he moving?  Was the job taking him up there, or for personal reasons?  Yeah, the job was taking him up there, and we was coming back, because we had to do it  in one day. 
[00:48:00]  Why?  That's bootlegging.  Yeah, so we were coming back, and we were going through this little town of Overly, and  we were doing 110 miles an hour, because it was like 1030 at night, and we still had 150  miles to go to get home, so we could both go to work.  And all of a sudden, he slams on the brakes, and I'm not wearing a seatbelt, and I damn  near go through the windshield.  Damn near.  And I said, what the fuck are you doing?  And he goes, oh, shit, this is Overly.  We've got to slow down.  And I go, hey, dude, I'm working in radio, and I was at the time. 
[00:48:30]  I said, Edwards County up here, all the cops are on strike, and they're not pulling anybody  over.  I said, fuck it.  Let's just go.  And he goes, really?  And I said, yeah.  And so he just fucking put the hammer down, and we were doing 125, and we just drove 125  to Edwards County, and it was the coolest fucking thing.  Driving through, there was like three other small cars.  Wow.  We're just fucking hauling ass. 
[00:49:00]  I know that would have been a good driver's paradise going through there at that point.  There's always that one pin that kind of wobbles.  Anyway, that's what I got.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  Oh, thank you.  Well, did you get the ticket or no?  No.  There were no cops around.  It was just my cousin, he's one of these shit kickers.  He's a goat roper, and he's, you know, just, we're driving along.  He goes, oh, shit, and he slams on the brakes.  And I go, hey, there's no cops around.  Oh, good.

[00:57:00]  We're just here  Prejudice is a bitch, though  Because it's just so  So much weight to carry  I wish sometime  You guys could go out  And just be black  For a little fucking while  You guys have no idea  You know, you see a concept  You think somebody  Just being in a bad mood  But the concept  Of somebody fucking with you  Because of your color  Is really strange  You know, you go in somewhere  And you get that look  Before you get there  You know you ain't getting a job  You get ready to show up  With all that energy  And you see that look  It's just a certain 
[00:57:30]  It's a certain thing  That white people have  They do it  Not out of malice or something  It's just something  They figure they have that look  It's a certain look  It's funny  I like to confront that  What you looking at, motherfucker?  Yeah, talking about you  If I don't get no job  Ain't no motherfucker  In here getting one  So we gonna turn it out 
[00:58:00]  You think about life  How life can change  Like I remember  When I was  Before I got in the show business  I think about this now, man  I used to be  Knocking motherfuckers  In the head  For money and shit  White guy come to my neighborhood  Motherfucker wasn't  The salesman in the daytime  He was in big trouble  Because I hit him in the head  With a sock  With a brick in it  I bet  You know that's gotta hurt  A lot of you should be glad 
[00:58:30]  I'm in show business  Because I was good at it  Hey, let's take this motherfucker out  Call Pryor  Richard, bring your sock  By the way, did you notice  The only reason we stop at Stuckies  Is to pee  Nobody buys anything  That's why those stores  Are so neat and clean  Nobody's ever touched that stuff  Oh, we'll look at it 
[00:59:00]  Like, oh, look, honey  They got pecan logs  You better put that log down  And go pee  Hell, we gotta get going  By the way, I was in Tennessee  Last week  And before I left  The last night I was there  The owner of that club  He said, look  Before you leave town  I'm gonna take you out  To a real nice dinner  Took me to the  International House of Pancakes  I said, oh, you shouldn't, honey  He acted like it was a big deal  Stretched out in the booth  Yeah, I already know you want it  It's on me 
[00:59:30]  I got their pigs in a blanket  They're at home now  Just rooting around  You know, the pancake house  Has a zillion different kinds  Of pancakes  There's two couples  In a booth next to us  And they got rid of  The pecan pancakes  Now, here's what they do  They put a half a cup  Of crushed pecans  On top of the pancakes  Then hot pecan syrup  On top of all that  Evidently, this girl  Did not hear her boyfriend  When he placed the order  Because when it was  Brought to the table  She said, boy, that looks good 
[01:00:00]  I wish I'd have got some of them  He said, here, take a bite of mine  She took a bite  Then she said  Wonder what gives it  That pecan flavor  I said, well, I'm not very bright  But hell, I'll take a shot at this  I said, better do them  Damn pecan  Years of you know  Idiots come in swarms 
[01:00:30]  You know that  I stopped at the dolphin exit  Wants to get gas  I always get self-serve  It costs less money  But I was in a hurry  The pumps were blocked  I pulled the full serve  The guy walked up to the window  And I said, fill it up  He said, with gas?  I said, what else do you have?  He said, I always like to ask  Just to make sure  Scared me  Fuck on this channel  Oh, Jesus 
[01:01:00]  That's shocking  Holy fuck, I need coffee  This is the best show ever  The O.B. Anthony Show  I hate this place  Nothing works here  The medications don't work  I've been here for seven years  Nothing works here  I hate this place  Nothing works here  The medications don't work  I hate this place  Nothing works here  The medications don't work 
[01:01:30]  I can't get enough of that thing  It's the O.A. virus spreading across America  I love that guy  Yeah  Love that guy  He's just having the time of his life  Over there in Bellevue  I hate this place  Man  A lot happens  When people are asleep  Notice that  Gazing into these TV screens  While we do our show  We have the news on  Every day  And  There are so many wrecks  In the morning  And then they just seem to 
[01:02:00]  Hose it down  Life goes on  Yeah, the average person  Wakes up and has no idea  What's going on  No  We get here nice and early  And the news starts up  With the latest horrific accident  Disasters  That's closing off  Major arteries  But no one's on the arteries yet  So it doesn't really matter  It doesn't matter  I thought I saw a car  Flipped over or something  There was an upside down car  That they had just put out  I guess  And another car  That just had no front end on it  A few yards away from it 
[01:02:30]  And there's, you know  Firefighters walking around  But they hose it down  They get the car carriers  To haul the vehicles away  And when the sun comes up  There's traffic  Just driving over it  Like nothing ever happened  Yeah  The average commuter  Has no idea  No clue  And it's usually the drunks  Coming home from the bars  I think  Oh yeah  I think it's all just  Drunk driving  Yeah, that'll do it  And for the most part  Not really hurting anyone  Because most people are sleeping  But these accidents  Every morning  Are just horrific  Yeah, and it's every morning  Every morning 
[01:03:00]  We tune in and go  Oh boy, there's another one  Hose it down  Get the people  Get the people to work  In the morning  You know what my grandmother  Used to say  Whenever somebody would fly by her  She would always look at them  Disgusted  But they would go by quickly  And go  Speedy Skippy  Speedy Skippy  That's what she said  All right, look  This guy  Good one  God  What?  All right, listen  Listen  To whoever's doing the phones  Sometimes they just hang up on people  Because they're not interesting  So when they call back  With the same thing 
[01:03:30]  Just come up with an excuse  Why we don't need them  Tell them we're moving on  Now you're killing me with curiosity  Who is this fella?  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, what do you got for the show?  A couple calls ago  Gunning Dennis  Called about the speeding thing  He's a cop, I guess  Yeah  He said something about  You know, you walk up to the window  And you ask him  Do you know why I pulled you over?  Do you know how fast you were going?  By the way, this is an example  Of an uninteresting call  And my question was  Another, like, get the member rights  Where you can't self-incriminate yourself?  Right  Wouldn't that apply there?  Well, I don't know what self-  What do you mean by self-incriminate yourself? 
[01:04:00]  Steve  He's got a legal team on the scene  Steve, how many times  Did you call back to say that today?  I just called back twice  Yeah, exactly  See, this is what I'm trying to tell you guys in the booth  We don't have to be nice on this show  Because we have a radio show to do  So sometimes I just hang up on people  Because we're trying to keep the phone lines clear  For other things  Oh, do you have to keep Steve on the phone  While you do this?  Oh, boy  It's nothing personal, Steve  I'm getting that gushy feeling  Steve, we kind of like  We already covered  We covered this  When we were talking about being stopped  All right 
[01:04:30]  My fault  No, no, it's all right  We didn't need a 20- to 30-minute conversation  Why the cop says  Do you know how fast you were going?  I don't care  Steve  Could I ask you to self-incriminate yourself  And say my call stunk?  Yes, my call stunk  Very good  Thank you  Self-incrimination  You guys rock  Thanks, buddy  Well, we're not on the same page  Because I'll look at the phone screen  I'll see four or five things  I just don't want to go to  And I know there's other people  Probably, you know, calling  With maybe something  That could be the next  Brilliant Opin' Anthony bit  So I hang up on people  I mean, I noticed that 
[01:05:00]  I saw  I was looking  And I saw your little cursor  Mouse cursor  Moving around  Hanging up on people  And I thought, oh, Op's figuring out  How to clear the lines  Right  So then, apparently  The guys that are screening the calls  The guys call back  And put them right back  Yeah, because they're like  I think I got hung up on  That's hysterical  Listen, if you're going to be a fan  Of this radio show  And you're going to be an active fan  Where you call up with stuff  That's great  But don't take it personally  If all of a sudden  The phone goes dead  It just means that  I'm trying to clear phone lines  That's all  We hung up on you 
[01:05:30]  Because by the time I go  Hey, get rid of line three  Four, you know, six  No one wants to hear that  As they're driving around  Now you do it yourself  Right  So I sometimes just  Hang up on a lot of people  Especially when  I mean  The phones have just exploded  On this show  It's great  It's great to see  That people want to participate  And call from all over the country  But sometimes, you know  We just got to move on  That's all  That's all  But it just amazes me  I see the same people  Calling back  With the same stupid craft  And I'm like  Dude  That's pretty funny  All right  Anthony, we're going to be 
[01:06:00]  Giving away my-fies  You want to explain  What a my-fi is?  A my-fi?  This is something that  The little dog company  Doesn't have  Won't have anytime soon  Because those stupid idiots  Over there decided to  Take all their work  Out of house  Yeah  You want to explain that?  Like my-fi is a way  To take XM with you  Take it along with you  Right  Like you would a Walkman  Or an iPod  See, here's the huge difference  Between XM Satellite  And the little doggy company  All their technology stuff  Stays in-house  Right 
[01:06:30]  You know, so they take it  Who stays in-house?  All the new technology  They're coming out with  Like the my-fi and stuff  XM  Yeah, XM  They do all that in-house  They've got engineers  That are just working for XM  Okay  The little doggy company  Sends it to other places  And then, you know  These other places  They have other things  They have to do  For other clients as well  And it's not a priority  Right  And that's why  XM Satellite Radio  Is way ahead of the game  Leaps and bounds  And that's why  They're the first  With the portable unit  The my-fi  Which is just absolutely amazing  Yes, it is 
[01:07:00]  You take it wherever you want  And listen to XM Satellite Radio  On the go  You can record this very program  And then  Then you can go down  In a mine shaft  In Pennsylvania  And listen to the program  Without even seeing  Any daylight  Or sky  Or nothing  Right  And you can fast forward  Through segments  Yeah  You hear a song you don't like  I don't want to listen to that  You don't like that  Marvin Gay mashup?  You fast forward  Right through it  Well technically they can't  Because listeners have been  Telling me that they have  The my-fi  And because of the display 
[01:07:30]  There's no way to fast forward  You can't just go  I don't know  It's a technical issue  That they're trying to work out  I guess  Because you know  The display on high voltage  Uh-huh  I guess that has to change  So then people know  What they're fast forwarding through  Oh really?  I guess  Well you could probably  Fast forward without knowing  Exactly where it's going to stop  I don't even know  I think it  I think it can only fast forward  Through whatever's displayed  On the screen  You gotta be shitting me  Well how can they fast forward  If we haven't said it yet? 
[01:08:00]  Oh that's true  Well because you can record it  Can we just fast forward it  And see how the show goes?  See if we did good?  Time to play  What did we learn  On the Opie and Anthony show?  We learned absolutely nothing  And this show flew by  We're out of here  Thanks  I don't know  We're getting a little too technical  They're gonna figure it out though  There's a bug as far as  Like rewinding the show  And fast forwarding  Because some people  Just with this program  Well some people fast forward  I'll explain  Because we have some freaks out there  That it's not good enough 
[01:08:30]  To listen to us once a day  They have to listen to us  Three or four times a day  The same show  And then they'll  They'll go  Oh I remember when they were  Talking about speeding tickets  Ah that wasn't that great  Of a segment  And then they'll fast forward  To the next segment  Which hopefully is this segment  Which is so brilliant  There you go  Of course it is  So we're giving away  MyFis  And we asked casually  What would you do  For a MyFi yesterday?  How would you do that?  Ask casually  Just casually  We're thinking  You know  What would you do 
[01:09:00]  For a MyFi?  So  So far  People have been  Sending in  What they would do  For a MyFi  Through opianthony.com  Is that what you have  In your hand?  All those?  Yeah all these  Wow  And some of them  Are just absolutely twisted  But some of these  I think  You know  Are worth the MyFi  Right?  Vince  Writes  How about I tell my wife  I want a divorce on air?  Anthony might like this  Good one  This would not be a joke 
[01:09:30]  She caught me cheating  Last February  And I'm tired of being with her  She skeeves me out  Just a thought  Vince  Imagine being with a woman  That skeeves you out  Yeah  You gotta sleep with it  Every night  That's a pretty good one  That is a good one  Yeah  But what if he's  Faking it or something  Well  We would have to be  The judges  We would know  We would know  You think?

[01:11:30]  For that MiFi  I'm with you  I think Paul's on to something  If Voss rubs behind his ear  The guy has to smell it  And then suck on Voss's finger  And then he has to eat  One of Voss's boogers  Not mine and yours  And Ben's  That's too much  One of Voss's boogers  On a Ritz cracker?

Oh yeah  We can get someone to suck Voss's finger  After he gets a good hunk of ear cheese though  Shut up!  Maybe after he gets a good hunk of ear cheese  The guy has to smell it  And then Voss rubs it on his teeth  And scrapes it on the guy's teeth  Quiet  Nice  Stop it!  Quiet  Where's Anthony?

Adam Baldwin  Yes  An opious Chris Makepeace  Well I guess  And a friend with the awful sinuses  Linderman

[02:01:30]  Because I don't get in the ring  And uh  No  That's not what I'm saying  What I'm saying is  Why did you make up the story  About being in litigation  And make it appear as though  Tim I don't think he made anything up  Yeah I don't think you're just  Trying to stir things up  Aren't you?  Yes  Yes you are  Jesus Tim you could have  But it's an observation of truth  It's not masked behind some  I'm a badass bodyguard  Oh hang up on him  I've had it

We don't know  Uh, but after the lamp exploded 
[02:12:30]  Quinn apparently stumbled into his bedroom  Where he died Sunday afternoon  Authority said  Police found no evidence of drug or alcohol abuse  Why would he put a lava lamp on the stove?  That's crazy  And then it says  Sucks to be you  But almost an unlucky lottery  What are the odds that the shard is gonna, you know  Go right into your heart like that?  Right  And it's  A heap of help and a stupidity, I think  Groovy way to go, though  Ooh 
[02:13:00]  A little different  Really tough to do a show when you've got adrenaline flowing through your body  Oh  How long does it take to calm down?  About 20 minutes, maybe?  You're really like, uh  Oh, dude, man  Look at my hand  You see the look he was giving us?  Yeah, I know, but  He's, you know, he's  He's a paid employee  I think he knows  His boundaries  And, you know, what his job is  You know, there are some times we come in here 
[02:13:30]  And perhaps we've had a disagreement with somebody else in the office  We don't go to throwing fisticuffs, Opie  We deal with it  Maybe a little time passes and everything's fine  Poe's a professional  Well-disciplined  Professional  I hope he's listening to all this  Here's what you're missing, though  You guys deal with it the way you deal with it  Which is on the air and well  So when there's a problem in the office  You deal with it on the air  The way he deals with problems  Is he removes a limb  Yeah  So his way of dealing with it  May just be his natural thing 
[02:14:00]  Of pulling off a freckled blonde arm  And beating Opie to death with it  He would probably beat Ben so hard  Ben's hair would just straighten out  It looked nice and neatly combed  Impossible  He'd hit Steve so hard  His little boots would ice up  Hat would go out  All of a sudden you'd just see smoke  I saw  I noticed Steve was awfully quiet during that whole break  That's what I'm saying  He didn't say anything  That's amazing  Oh, I know  I don't want him to throw water on my boots  Actually, Steve 
[02:14:30]  For many years  Steve was our defender  He was our protection  Steve was our protection  Did you see how quickly Steve handed Poe the garbage can  Without knowing what Poe was going to do with it  Here's the trash can  Steve just handed a weapon over to him  I thought I was going to be completely humiliated  And there was going to be nothing I could do about it  Oh, I thought he was putting that trash can over your head  So did I  And how do you survive that?  How do you come back from that?  There's no dignity  How do you go out in public?  You have to sit there and just pretend you're meant to be  I can't think of that fucking thing's name 
[02:15:00]  Bob Cunt Squarepants  Oh, Spongebob  Spongebob Squarepants  You know?  You could take the garbage pail off of you  But your dignity is in there with the trash  Never to come out again  And then there's like milk and whatever else we've thrown in the garbage pail  Since 6 this morning  Just kind of falling from my hair  You know what I don't like about sitting outside with Steve in that outfit  Is that moths fly around his head and feet  It's courtesy for you, Jim 
[02:15:30]  Let's say how to say it  Let's all put another log on the Steve  Chesting?  Chesting?  Chesting?  I was going to sing  Chestnuts Roasting  By Steve Sleet  You're so eager to get it all out in one word  Chestnuts Roasting  Chesting  Chesting to fire  Fat neck, little thin lips  Oh, so eager to please  Old Komodo Dragan torso 
[02:16:00]  Dragan?  Just shut up!  Stop the pain!  Dragan?  I am  Oh, what a motherly fucking mush  Sam from Florida, what's up?  Sam?  Yeah, man  Hey, Opie  That's not adrenaline  That's fucking pussy juice  Yeah  I can't argue with you today, man  Dan from Wisconsin  What's up, Dan?  Love this time of year  Watching the Yule, Steve 
[02:16:30]  When someone gives you a guard dog  To protect you  It's okay  To yank his chain  Every now and then  But you don't  Piss him off  And pull his tail  I mean  He'll turn around  And bite your hand  Clean off  I want to make this perfectly clear  That I'm not the only one  That was involved in this thing  Hey, all of you  Were poking him with sticks  Not me  Everyone had a sharp stick  Not Jimmy  I didn't do any poking  And not me  I learned a valuable lesson today  Yeah, you all were giving him a gouge 
[02:17:00]  Every now and then  All right, Dan  Thank you  You be careful now  We have another crazy story, Anthony  That happened right here in New York City  She survived subway jump  People are jumping in front of subways  All the time in Manhattan  Oh, it's the way to go  You get a few of these every year  Remember the time that the guy got hit with the subway?  Oh, one of the most uncomfortable moments ever  Remember?  You know why, right?  It was the receptionist at WNEW's son  But we had no idea, remember?  Oh, no 
[02:17:30]  It was like on page three of the post  This story about how this guy  I do remember  Leand over to see if the subway was coming  And he was looking the wrong way  And he got smashed on the back of the head  He survived, though, right?  Yeah, he survived  He had a lot of permanent damage  Hey, I hear it coming  But I can't see it  Right  I hear the whistle  So he's looking down the tracks the wrong way  The subway hits him in the back of the head pretty much  And really messes him up  And we went on and on  You want to talk about uncomfortable  We went on and on for like 20 minutes  How stupid this person was  Got to be the stupidest man alive 
[02:18:00]  Blah, blah, blah  And then I forgot who came in  Just with a panicked look on their face  Like, shut up  You know whose kid that is?  And it was the receptionist of the radio station  I hear it  Receptionist's son  Of the radio station we were working at  I swear I hear something  I need a good crash  Yeah  It takes too long, right?  Yeah  So she survived subway jump  Check this out  A distraught teacher jumped onto Manhattan subway tracks yesterday morning  Hunched  So she jumps down into the tracks 
[02:18:30]  She sees the subway coming  She decides she's going to die, obviously  But she decides to hunch down  And prepare for the impact  For the impact  So she hunches down  And six cars of a 400 ton train  Roared over her  And she survived with barely a scratch  Could you imagine?  What an idiot  She just panicked  I think if she leaned  She rolled over  She didn't want to get hit  Or she would have  See, that's the way to do it, though  The thin 35 year old woman  Fits safely in the shallow trowel  Between the rails 
[02:19:00]  Leaving witnesses in awe  Of the rush hour miracle  At the busy 59th street hub  She should have went  Stood up and gone  Ta-da!  You know what we haven't had in a while  Remember every year you get  We haven't had them this year  As the guys pushing people  The crazy homeless guy that pushes you  Comes right from behind and pushes you  I don't think it's been cold enough  When it gets cold  They all head down into the subway  And start pushing people  Because they're angry  Yeah  That it's cold  But that's a pretty amazing story today  But if you're an idiot  I mean, first of all 
[02:19:30]  You should not be looking for the train  You should be nowhere near the edge of the platform  Whenever I take the subway  While I'm waiting for it  I stand against the wall  So no one can even get behind me  Because you don't know  Some nuts in the city  There's all these kooks  That go around  Bashing people on the head  With cobblestones  That was a big one  A couple of years back  Yeah, tourist?  Yeah, that was like 2001's big thing  Is homeless guys with cobblestones  Why in 2001, you know  Roads made of cobblestone anymore 
[02:20:00]  You ever have to drive on these friggin' streets?  Bleh!  It's like, what year is this?  We're in New York City in 2004  And I'm driving on cobblestones  And you shake one loose  And a homeless guy decides to pick it up  Carry it around in his shopping cart  Until a dog tells him to wail it over some poor sap's head  And then there you are  All fucked up for the rest of your life  There's a lot of ways to die in New York City  Well, the reason that was 2001  Is because that guy actually took a brick  And smashed somebody's head 
[02:20:30]  And another homeless guy said  That is so 98  See, what you need is this  This is a cobblestone  Yeah  All right  Tony in the Bronx  Hey, Tony  What's going on?  Why don't you strap on your scuba gear  And fight Master Paul underwater  Take it a few feet underwater  I wonder if he could fight as well as I can underwater  Yep  Punch it out, guys  Thank you  Kick your ass underwater  Just grab your ass  60 feet underwater  I would never even 
[02:21:00]  Fight as good as you can  You had one fight underwater with a Frenchman  Well, how many fights have you had underwater?  None  Jim, how many fights have you had underwater?  I've had about four  I could be the only man alive  That has ever fought 60 feet underwater  Battling your hog in the bathtub doesn't count  I got you  Come here, you  Trying to get it out of the ducky  Before all the water drains  All right, well  Don't mock it unless you've  One fight 
[02:21:30]  Unless you've tried it  60 feet underwater with a French guy  Yeah  What kind of fight is a French guy going to put up?  Not a good one  Yeah  Slow motion fighting rules  It really does  Dave in Indianapolis  What's up, Dave?  I was just wondering  Isn't there anything in that 30 minutes of paperwork  That the guests fill out  That would protect Master Poe from a lawsuit?  Oh, I see  You know what?  That started out as just a fun little thing  You know, this guy wants to fight Master Poe for a MiFi 
[02:22:00]  We actually weren't going to have Master Poe fight anybody  No, we just want to hear the guy talk  We know that would be a bad idea  We want to hear the caller  The guy that offered to fight  We want to hear him talk some smack  That's all  That's it  And then it turned into a big thing  Because Anthony decided to make believe we were still on the air  It just amazes me  Listen to the replay yourself  You'll hear it  Yep, listen to the replay  You will hear Opie say  No, we're off the air  And then you'll see  Too bad you can't see Anthony lean back  In mock, casual, relaxing thing  To make him lower his guard 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, I forgot about that  How you were all leaning back  Shut up  That was your after show posture  I was stretching  Yeah, leaning back  But being able to reach forward just enough to hit a couple of those buttons in front of you  Oh, thank you for the hanging out to dry  What about Opie?  How long before we go to break?  Two minutes?  We got two minutes before we go to the break?  My acting stinks too  It worked well enough  Yeah, alright  So  Oh, the leaning back thing 
[02:23:00]  Stop it  I didn't really want to roll out your hands behind your head just to disarm him  You totally sold me out right there  I didn't hear Jimmy Norton go  No, we're on the air still, Master Poe  Jimmy Norton's a good actor  He took his headphones off like he was on break  Oh, you took your headphones off too, see?  I believed it  I thought we were on a break  You did not  Oh, stop it  You know my acting stinks  I think you're a very good actor  I thought we were on a break  Yeah, sure  Liar, liar  Pants like Steve's hat  Brian in Levittown, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys? 
[02:23:30]  I just want to say Christmas morning  I'm going to turn on channel 4  And watch the Yule Steve  Of course  Or I made that John Malkovich film  In the line of Steve  Oh my god, you stink  Dude, I'm so tired  You're awful today  I've been up to Jeff today  In the line of Steve  Like the chariot of Steve's shoes  Oh  Man on Steve's shoes was really good with Denzel  Oh god  Wow 
[02:24:00]  Oh, is that actually  Well  Alright, I'm going to make it perfectly clear  That Anthony wants to talk to Brian  Not me  Let's just hear what Brian has to say  Well, why don't you say hi to Brian  Hello, Brian  Yo  Hi  Are you actually the guy that wrote in and wanted to fight Master Poe?  Yes, I am  Ah  Yes, I am  I can give you my email address and everything  Thanks for starting a little bit of crap on the show 
[02:24:30]  What the hell happened?  A little infighting?  I just got  Well, what happened was that I was almost paralyzed  And Anthony was almost thrown through a window  And would have fell probably six to seven stories to his death  Thanks to you  My bad  Well, and Norton would have just skated out of here  Yep  I'd like to know where Brian's from  Connecticut  He's from Connecticut  And what are your fighting qualifications, sir?  Qualifications?  Well, I've done a little MMA here and there 
[02:25:00]  Mixed martial arts for those who don't know  MMA?  MMA?  Yes  Mixed martial arts  Yes  And probably not as much as Poe  But I just want to prove that I can probably hang in there with him  For a few minutes  Win the Wi-Fi  And you know  All kidding aside  There's no way you can hang in there with Master Poe  We've seen the guy in action  Yeah  Look at me kissing Master Poe's ass now  But it's the truth  Are you a big guy?  Or are you like a wiry guy that can kick some ass?  No, about 6'1", 210  We've seen in Master Poe spar and it's pretty ugly 
[02:25:30]  That's part of the main time  Yeah, I don't know if we can get this done  We can't only because  If he hurts you, and he probably will  Yeah  That's what he's talking about in lawsuits  He'll get sued  Because he's here to protect  And all of a sudden  You know, we have him ripping people's arms out  And smashing them with us  I usually end up hurting someone real bad  Yeah  Well, hey, you know what?  If I had to sign a waiver  I'll sign a waiver, whatever  All right, yellow belly  Harvey  All right, well  Harvey  It's a thought  We'll see what happens with that 
[02:26:00]  We got your info, all right?  All right, dude  All right  Well, there's the guy that started all the trouble  Hey, get a load of fat soda  So the Dick Ebersole plane crashes  Oh  I don't know why  One second  I don't know why these business executives  And these Hollywood types are still flying these private jets  Those are the things that are going down more often  I like it  Than any other aircraft  That's what I was going to say  One second  You're on your private plane  You got your handsome family with you 
[02:26:30]  You're rich  You're winging all over the United States  Going to things  And jam with the stones  Jam with the stones  And then the next minute  You're stumbling around the flaming wreckage  One of your kids are dead  And, you know, you're freaking out  Can we discuss  This sucks  Just the way the different papers  There's three papers we have here  One is Daily News  And here's the article  Students grieve for Teddy  That's the kid's name  Yeah  And in the, it looks like  One of the other papers 
[02:27:00]  It said  Body of youngest Ebersole son found  So those are, you know, pretty normal headlines for a tragedy such as this, right?  And this is the post, I believe  Yeah  NBC jet kid dead  That's the way  That's exactly the way they phrase it  That's the post  NBC jet kid dead  It's so impersonal  And there's no reason to write a headline like that  He doesn't work for NBC  No  It's just stupid 
[02:27:30]  NBC jet kid dead  Jet kid dead  But then it says underneath  Body of Ebersole son in wreckage  Like that explains it  They just  It's like  Do you have to be a sensationalist scumbag publication all the time?  That's really awful  It's not like this guy's a  Like if you write something like that about Robert Chambers  Some awful, you know, scumbag headline  Because he's a piece of shit  But this is a 14 year old kid  Preppy killer  I'm sure the post came up with that one  Yeah, and I'm sure that's a good name for him  That's what he is 
[02:28:00]  Preppy  Jew neck twister  Arrested  Jew broad neck twister  Arrested on drug charge  I remember when Lennon got shot  The post was so insensitive  The headline read  Chink lover eats lead  Holy shit  What is wrong?  Well, that's what the post would write  I didn't say that  The post wrote it  I understand what he's going for there  That's what the post would write  They're insensitive  I didn't tell them when George Harrison passed away 
[02:28:30]  To have the headline read  Adios, puddin' head  They couldn't fix the hole  That the tumor came in  Shit  Now you got me doing it  See how much that hurts?  It really does  Jesus  Oh my god  That's just a very tasteless way  Well, the post is known for their headlines 
[02:29:00]  Sure  They really are there  So, uh  Yeah  I gotta pull my nose  I wish that guy was here to eat it  Nah  They need a tissue or a napkin  There you are  What a mess  Thank you, Jimmy  They just don't handle things with dignity  I'm sorry  Well, this just in about the plane crash, by the way  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station  The plane skidded off the runway  And burst into Steve's 
[02:29:30]  That was awful  God, my nose is running  Same joke over and over again  Eco from Philly  I wonder if the plane went down  In a huge smoking inferno of Steve's shoes  Wow, these guys get it  Jerry Lee Lewis from Wackbag  Charlotte  When you say flaming wreckage  Do you mean wreckage  Wreckage of the Steve variety?  Wow 
[02:30:00]  Alright  NBC jet kid dead  That is just awful  Very insensitive  It's just  And it's not necessary  I don't mind something insensitive if it's necessary  Like  Whatever it would be  Like the Chambers thing  Well, you know what I mean?  You know, or maybe when the Rodney King beating happened  I didn't think that they needed to put  Jig head gets lumpy  But that was what they  That was what they chose to put 
[02:30:30]  Oh my god  What?  The bill's not even going to help that, Anthony  No  That wasn't that bad  Mike from Virginia  This is how the Post had the headline of Reagan's death  President Reagan  Forgetful man forgets to breathe  Not bad  And then Kerry  Kerry from Jersey, I guess  This is true  A real New York Post headline from a few years ago  I remember this one  Headless body and topless bar  Yep 
[02:31:00]  Do you remember that one?  That was a good one  I do remember that one, yes  Very good  Thank you for being there  I'm sorry  But it was unnecessary  When Nancy Reagan had the mastectomy  For them to have the headline  One down, one to go  Was there any real reason for that?  It just wasn't right  All right, well  It is sad, though  Yeah  Obviously  Duke from Jersey 
[02:31:30]  What's up, Duke?  Goodness gracious  Great  Pappy from Jersey  Morning, fellas  Hey  Morning, sugar pants  Hi, angel eyes  I'm sorry  I have a mouthful of smoothie  Yeah, it's smoothie time  Yep  A little earlier than usual  But  Hey  Back when this guy in California  Killed all these guys  In a McDonald's  The headline in the post 
[02:32:00]  Was Big Mac Attack  Yeah, that's true, too  Big Mac Attack  Wow  That's what's sad about this  The fake ones aren't that  All from the real ones  That the post does  The post just tries so hard  To  Let people think  They're a legitimate newspaper  And that they're outraged  By certain things  Whenever the post  Or that Phil Mushnick  Cocksucker  Decides  He's gonna  Spread some of his 
[02:32:30]  Morality around  Just look where  Look where you draw  Your paycheck from  You dolt  His last name is  Mushnick  He is a Mushnick  Ugh  Sounds like a  Yiddish insult  A Mushnick  You're a Mushnick  A Mushnick on you  And your family  I never take it off  I die with it  On my Mushnick  Yeah, we forgot  Yeah, this guy reminds us  This was a real 
[02:33:00]  New York Post headline  When Arafat died  Arafat Lady Sings  Yeah, he had his  Big Fat Wife on the cover  Arafat Lady Sings  Good one  Oh, um  Booby Man from Brooklyn  Checking in, Anthony  Um, he writes  Hey, I lost my job today  I was steved  Oh  Slappy C from Jersey  Say  Norton is on Steve's  Shoes this morning  Oh, God 
[02:33:30]  I wish I could think  Of more fucking  Tragedies  Hmm  God  Was this a real  Headline?  What?  Bud Dwyer shoots off  At the mouth  Could be  No, I doubt it  Could very well have been  Why do I doubt it?  Hmm  What a fool  Why do I doubt it?  Why did you doubt that?  I don't know  You know, we're all  Trolling for headlines  Oh, I know  Why can't this refresh faster? 
[02:34:00]  We're trying to get  The listeners involved  So this show  Could have some timing  No  No  No  No, that didn't work  Iron Jeff  Sorry  Last time Michael Jackson  Was accused of rape  The post headline was  Jacko gets some cracko  I don't think  I don't think  Jacko gets some cracko  I do remember though  When Michael Jackson  Was doing that Pepsi video  And somebody threw  One of Steve's shoes  At him  Chris from Philly 
[02:34:30]  New York Post headline  On Kurt Cobain's death  Guess he did have a gun  That's a good one  Daniel from Alabama  I just found an old  Headline from the 70s  Leonard Skinner  Goes down on Steve  In Louisiana  Yes 
[02:35:00]  Hey, now jokes  Are coming in, Anthony  Oh  Steve from Philly  What's the difference  Between a Jew and a pizza?  A pizza doesn't scream  When you put it  In Steve's shoes  Oh  Ouch  That's awful Steve  From Philly  You should be ashamed  Of yourself  Was Eric late this morning  Because of Steve's  Boots alarm? 
[02:35:30]  Slappy from Jersey  Headline  Calgary Stives  Win the Stanley Cup  And James is learning  Something in Toronto  He learned today  That my favorite  Hendrix song  Is actually called  Steve  I do like that one  Johnny Cash number  Burn and ring  Of Steve's shoes  God, we can run  Shit into a ground  Yeah, don't we  Don't we know how  Instead of having  Money headlines prepared  Just keep doing  The shoe jokes 
[02:36:00]  Alright  Why don't we  Why don't we  Break  I can't think of  Any more headlines  Or Steve  I've been looking  At this goddamn  NBC jet kid  Dead and getting  Annoyed all morning  And I only had  Two of them ready  Yeah, two fine ones  Though I must say  Yeah, I should have  Had like six or seven  Or eight  Yeah  Overheard at the end  Of the episode  Of The Apprentice  Your

I don't know what that's from  Yes, it is  I think it is, right?  Of course it is  That's outside the airport when Steve Martin was on the ground  I love that movie  John Candy with his awful perm and his mustache  Del Griffin  What, Griffin?  Del Griffin  Black Sabbath, by the way 
[02:46:00]  Even though this is the cover of a Sabbath song  All right  Wine beat  Super nut  We're back with the O&A show  We like to call it the O&A virus  If you're helping spread the word  Thank you, thank you very much  We appreciate it  Spread it  We got to give away one of these MyFives this week, I believe  So, I think we're going to try to get that girl to do the threesome  Why not?  Is that the one we are  I think we do, like, gunning for?  I think we do about one sex bit a week  Yeah  So, we're due for one 
[02:46:30]  Sure  If she does what she says  If she does what she says she's going to do  There you go  Thank you  We'll give her a MyFive  Cool  And then next week I think we'll do the Rich Vos one  Unless better ones come in overnight  What could be better than eating one of Vos' boogers off a cracker?  Listening to his CD, maybe  And smelling the crap that builds up behind his ear  And then licking the finger that peeled it out  Sucking  Sucking  We've seen three people puke 
[02:47:00]  Clean that finger  Puke  Smelling his finger  It is horrific  You wouldn't do that ant for a thousand bucks?  No  Man, one day, can you just take one for the team and smell what he's got going on?  I've done it  Uh-uh  I don't care  Norton's done it  I don't care  I've done it many times  Sex Bagel's done it  We'll never do it  All the guys have done it  Never?  Nope  Even for the team?  Because that'll remain in my memory  No  It goes well  It stinks  No  No  No  No  No  Alright  How about if he just rubs it in your mustache? 
[02:47:30]  Oh  Oh my God  Stop it  No  No?  Just sits there  Yeah  No, I won't  I won't  Well, Anthony, the list of dangerous toys  Christmas  Is out  Oh, Christmas  Is out  Every year there's a bunch of toys that are made and get recalled  And they get recalled as a public  Little tykes choke on stuff  The New York Public Interest Research Group  I guess they buy all the toys  Test them 
[02:48:00]  And then decide which ones are very dangerous for your child  Throw them in ten cribs  And count how many living babies there are  After the day's worth of play  Yeah, I wonder how they do their experiments  And the news, man  Bunches  That one's blue  The news  They're just a bunch of scumbags  Yeah  Because I saw this the other day  Coming up  Is the child  Is the child  Jesus, I got it now  Is the toy your child playing with dangerous?  Yeah  We'll tell you after this  And there's your little Johnny in the other room  Playing with all his toys 
[02:48:30]  And you're wondering if one of those toys is going to kill him  But you have to wait through the commercial break  You got to wait  Because these scumbags want to, you know, get their ratings up  I've seen ones that it's not even a commercial break  It's a teaser for the news that isn't even going to come on  Until later that night  And they go  Toys could kill your children  We'll tell you which ones  At 11  Are you driving a dangerous car?  Tune in at 11 o'clock  For our inside investigation  A popular food  Poisoned 
[02:49:00]  We'll tell you what it is  I can't eat until  What?  11  They love that  They love doing that one  Absolutely love that  And then they call us scumbags  So now they got the toys  You know, the recalled toys  But  I know we're moving on  But  Joe from Staten Island  Go ahead, Joe  Real fast  Yeah, I'm willing to walk across these booths for a mi-fi  Alright, I'm going to go fuck my sink  Later  Wow 
[02:49:30]  Nice call back  What a good call  Yeah, he knew exactly how to make a call to a radio station  And he's gone  And he's gone  I like the people that just know how it's done  Oh, yeah  In and out  That's it  That's it  Very good  So there's a list of the dangerous toys that we should be watching out for  How dangerous are these?  Not really that  I don't know  I've never heard of any of these things  Hey, Mae, I see you  Don't lift your cheek  Slipping a cheek off the chair  Oh  I actually  I did not do it 
[02:50:00]  Did not do it  I promise you I didn't do it  Then what the hell is that?  I lifted my cheek  But I was afraid if I eased it out  It was going to be a butterscotch pudding  Extravaganza  A Tippy Tom on these?  Yeah, especially after one of those nice smoothies  That's the last thing you knew  It was blasting into my socks  So I stopped  Choking hazard toys  Not properly labeled  Fun years  Music  Big drum  Musical set  Hot wheels  Rev up cars  Oh, you know what toy is really bad this year?  Fist of drunken father  When child is talking loud  When supposed to be in bed 
[02:50:30]  That's a really dangerous one  Careful  Careful of that one  Could cause bruising  Did that happen to you as a kid?  No, it didn't  But you got to be careful too  The black kids are having a little problem with the toy this year  Is that the  There's this toy called  Teacher's mouth  Makes your penis wet  In certain parts of Long Island  I love that woman  I can't get enough of that  She's a hot chick  She was very hot  And you know the kid's not mad  And the kid's not mad  The little kid couldn't be mad 
[02:51:00]  He's probably pissed at his brother for sea blocking  Rattin' him out  Yeah  What was that story again?  Which one was this now?  He was an 8 year old kid  The teacher couldn't get enough of him  Wait, that blonde?  That's her  I thought that was the other blonde from the other one  Oh, maybe it is  Maybe I'm just building it up  Damn it  I think that kid that the blonde was with was older than 8  He was 12  12  Oh, was he?  There's one that was 8  See, I think if you're 12 years old and your teacher wants to bang you  You're really into it and very happy that it's happening  If you're a boy? 
[02:51:30]  Yes  But if you're a girl, then there's all sorts of problems  And it's creepy  Then it gets  I don't know, I mean  It's such a double  But it's such a double standard  It really is  Just saying people sometimes  I dreamt of that crap when I was 12 years old  Without  Oh my god  Your teacher banging you?  Your hot teacher that was only  You know, you thought they were old at the time  But they were probably only 23, 24 just out of, you know, college  10 years older than you  10 years older?  Of course I dreamt of that  Yeah  I wouldn't have told my brother  I would have enjoyed every minute of it  I didn't have any hot teachers, though 
[02:52:00]  You know?  I had a hot French teacher that everybody wanted to bang  She knew it  She wore, like, low-cut, you know, tops and everything  Had really nice French boobs  French boobs?  Just nice, milky, white  The hair on the sides of them?  No, well, I don't know  That's a good point  And then she had that nice French accent  I mean, she knew it, too  Oh, she was really French  She was a little sex kitten, yeah  Ooh  So  Careful of those kids' toys  But I think then, you know, under 12  And maybe, yeah, maybe then people should be outraged 
[02:52:30]  But every 12-year-old boy out there is dreaming of getting laid by an older woman  12's kind of a weird time, though  You could either be 12 and be pretty mature  And be a pretty good representation of what you're going to be  And physically, you know, you're kind of grown up  Or you can be a little kid that just  Dude, we're trying to have a serious conversation  Oh, man  We weren't paying enough attention to that you had a fart  So then we have to acknowledge you again  No, I don't  Just go ahead 
[02:53:00]  I don't want to be acknowledged  You just go home reeking of Lysol  Ben will pick that up  And I swear, he looks like he's spraying a fire hose, 1963  He's spraying me like I'm a hornet on his egg salad sandwich  I just sit here and shamefully take it  Can we start recording them at least?  I meant to be quiet  Can we set up some kind of recording device in here  Where we can at least record them?  Why not?  I'm doing it in Steve's studio  Yeah, please  Like he's going to do that  Please, yeah  I should hold one of his shoes up to my ass  See, and we all have ADD in here 
[02:53:30]  I don't know what we were just talking about  I do  What were we talking about?  Dangerous kids toys  And then you were talking about 12 years old being a strange age  Right  That's one of those  Or you can just be a little kid  Right  When you look and act like a little kid  You know, I remember probably going into being 12  I was pretty immature and, you know  Like little kiddish  And then coming at a 12  I was more like I, you know, I was going to be during my teen years 
[02:54:00]  So it's kind of an odd time  But  Banging your teacher?  Eh, sure  Why not?  Why not?  At 12?  Sure  Why not?  Dangerous toys, Anthony  Hot Wheels, Rev Up Cars  What's wrong with that one?  I don't know  They don't tell you what's wrong with them?  Not really  Just like little pieces?  Yeah, we're talking  Well, these are the choking toys  Choking hazards?  Got to be parts that fall off that the kids could choke on  But there's other hazards too, Hope 
[02:54:30]  It's not just choking toys  Choking hazard  No, they got categories  In South Carolina, they're saying that you have to  The minivans are very bad for kids  Oh boy  Especially when put in reverse  And they still hate your hackling, by the way  That bed can laugh and have fun  Fisher-Price Loving Family Pony Parade  Oh  You can choke on that  You can choke on it  Choke on the  You can choke on it  Choke on the pony penis  Horse gag 
[02:55:00]  The Baby Annabelle with pacifier and rattle  Ah, the pacifier, I'm sure  And just like home stove with sounds, I guess, has parts that the kids could choke on  Strangulation hazards, Anthony  The water yo-yo balls  Water yo-yo balls?  Wow, we're out of touch  What the hell is a water yo-yo ball?  I've never heard of that  But you can strangle yourself with it?  Yes  What happened was the water yo-yo balls is the toy that they sold in Houston, Texas  And a woman named Andrea Yates, she puts her children in a bob up and down in the tub like yo-yos 
[02:55:30]  Blub, blub, blub, blub, up, down, up, down  That is hazardous  Then the bubbles stop  That is very hazardous  And another strangulation toy is the bungee ruse, whatever that is  Bungee ruse  Does that come with a colorful little cowboy hat and boots?  Boots with little taps on him to do a little dance in Colorado 
[02:56:00]  That could be a choking hazard  Oh, by the Garrett, little blonde wispy hair is not included  Oh my god  We are never getting less nervous  Oh, come on, it happened years ago  Yeah, please  You can talk about it now  I didn't tell her to look that good  There's a problem now with the new Joel Steinberg play toy set 
[02:56:30]  That they say that the handcuffs are hazardous and radiator not included  Oh, like the little Katie Beers dream house  Underground dungeon sold separately  Oh, the Ethan Pat's hide-and-go-seek game  Little Adam Wash bobbleheads 
[02:57:00]  All right, I'm going home  Spring sold separately  Okay, maybe I went too far with that one  God, that was horrible  I knew that one was going to be  Tragedy  Oh, good news though, Anthony 
[02:57:30]  It was sold separately  The spring off  Torso not included  Holy shit  That's awful  Anthony, this just in, Booby Man from Brooklyn  Yeah  A lot of the children's toys are Steve resistant  So that's good news  All right, there we go 
[02:58:00]  No, this would be really awful right here  You don't want to joke about that  Too soon  Oh, no  Too soon  It only happened two days ago  Here's a little rule in comedy  You don't make fun of something before the dental records are back  Oh, crap  Awful 
[02:58:30]  Oh  What is this?  It's a yo-yo ball  Oh, the yo-yo balls  Yeah, it doesn't look dangerous  Oh, I've seen these things  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah  It's like a  A rubber ball  My nephew and niece have these  On the end of a rubber bungee thing  That you put on your finger  And use like a yo-yo  These things are actually addicting  They're kind of cool  They have soccer balls like this almost  That you tie around your waist 
[02:59:00]  Seriously, I'm not even joking  And you kick them  And they teach you how to  To like kick a soccer ball  Wouldn't it snap back into your nuts?  It's not necessarily a rubber string  It's more like a regular  Oh, got ya  All right  Anthony, there's also excessively loud toys  Oh  For the little tots that have their ears  That are still developing there  The Barbie Princess musical CD Boombox  And the Elite Operations M1 Tank  From Jeffrey Inc  A little loud  And then potentially toxic toys 
[02:59:30]  There's a couple that made that list  Toxic?  Hello Kitty Star Glitter Nail Polish  And Sculpey Oven Baked Clay  Yes, Jimmy?  He's biting his hands so hard  Oh, I know  He's trying to control himself  No way  No way, he says  Wow, he's got a line  He's got a line  Just, people  Just think of some of the things 
[03:00:00]  Jimmy has said on this show  And there's something in his head right now  That he deems too offensive to say  Just think of how horrific that must be  Well  I think the listeners want in  They want to help out the parents out there  Yes, Nick in Michigan  I think you forgot to mention  One of the hazardous toys  You forgot the chiving little outdoorsman kit  I think that's that hunter  Yeah 
[03:00:30]  That was  Hunter shooting his fellow hunters  Yeah  Yeah, that would be bad  Kevin in Boston, what's up?  Yeah, the station nightclub play set  Comes with boots  The what?  The station nightclub play set  Comes with steam boots  And a great white CD with it  Oh  All right  Oh  Yeah  Well, I guess  What we were going to try to do here today  Was talk about some of the toys  That we grew up with 
[03:01:00]  Which were  A lot more hazardous  True  Hazardous than the toys we just mentioned  The Robert Reed  T-cell yo-yo  That doesn't come back up  Just drops  The little Matthew Eepin baby shakes a lot  Wow  British nanny not included  The Connor Peterson father-son fishing game 
[03:01:30]  Anchors away soundtrack  Sold separately  It's a little  Is this  I can't 
[03:02:00]  No, don't do it  Let me say you ass  That is horrible  I cannot say that  You wrote this down?  No, I don't say it  Yeah, too soon  Yeah  Too soon  You're right  Oh, phew  Rule of comedy  Don't make fun of things  Until it stops smoldering  Oh  All right 
[03:02:30]  My first lava lamp cooking set  Oh  Jamie's  Jamie's  Little lotion bucket  Who?  That's the girl  That was in the well  Isn't her name Jamie?  Silence of the Lambs?  No, it was Karen  Karen Freddy  Jamie was  James Gum  Jamie Gum 
[03:03:00]  Was him  Yeah  James Gum  Oh, then I guess  It would work for that too  Oh, yeah  The lotion basket  But he was more Buffalo Bill  Yeah  But Jamie  That's the guy who actually knows the movie  Nice try, Freddy  Well, now we've got to play that song  Oh, yeah  Oh  My head hurts  God  God  Peterson  All right  Oh, it's awful  Anthony, from Silence of the Lambs  The Musical  Yes  This thing is getting more and more popular 
[03:03:30]  As the weeks go on  What magazine is this featured in?  Entertainment Weekly  And what?  Is it one of the hot things that people could buy  Or something like that?  Yeah  Yeah, Entertainment Weekly  We're on to this first  Put the effing lotion in the baskets  It rubs the lotion on its skin  It does this when it's told  It rubs the lotion on its skin  Or else it gets the hose  And when it's done  There's one more thing  A simple little task  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket 
[03:04:00]  Put the fucking lotion in the basket  All these stupid women are the same  Helps me not to think of them as human  So I call them it  Instead of by their names  Mister, please, no more abuse  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been 
[03:04:30]  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose  Stop trying now, you big fat moose  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket  Your chances for survival are remote  I'm impervious to all your silly whining  So I pound before I jam them off  I pound your fucking throat  Mister, please, my mom's got money  Let me go, this isn't funny 
[03:05:00]  Cops are sure to send somebody  Turn me loose, don't be a dummy  Listen to you scream and wail  Keep it down, you fucking wail  Mind the broken fingernail  The last girl climbed halfway but failed  Precious, she's down here, you piece of shit 
[03:05:30]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  I'd kill you but there's someone at the door  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you  It's a waste of skin  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store  Put my fucking precious in the basket  Don't you hurt my one and only friend  You don't know what pain is but I'll teach you 
[03:06:00]  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  There you have it  From the Silence of the Lambs, the musical CD  I think you could get it by going through opianthony.com  And they're still coming in  Dangerous toys, Anthony  The second you think the listeners are offended  They start sending in some real awful stuff 
[03:06:30]  Oh my god, they take it to the next level  Case from Brooklyn  The Bethany Hamilton surfboard  Arm not included  Thank you for that  Mormon from D.C.  The Christopher Reeve rodeo playset  I like the Christopher Reeve My Little Pony  Mikey Biggs from Long Island  The Shelley Long relationship game  Pills not included  That song is so addicting 
[03:07:00]  The Abu Ghraib Lego people  Stack them up  People are horrible  Let's go to Steve  Hey, how you guys doing today?  What's up, Steve?  I got one  Well, actually I got two  The first one is the Little Doggy Company  Portable Radio for Children  Known to cause back strained  And herniated discs  While moving it from plate to plate  Very good 
[03:07:30]  The other one is the Jeffrey Dahmer kitchen set  Hands not included  He likes it  He's laughing  He's just laughing  He's having his own thing  Tony from Chicago  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  You left two gifts off the list there  The first one is the Joel Steinberg Louisville Slugger  And the second is Susan Smith Child Safety Seat  Not bad  We did both of those references already  But they're not bad  John from Denver  John Benet Ramsey 
[03:08:00]  Dress up and bondage kit  Oh  That is rough  Mike in Allentown  Hey, how's it going?  Home of the Bear Man  Yeah, they're on down here  The one that you guys left out  Is a Siegfried and Roy lion tamer kit  I'd like to know who Siegfried and Roy are  I know  It's Siegfried  I have a Siegfried and Roy  Alright, so when we were growing up 
[03:08:30]  The toys were a little dangerous, right?  The Noreen Shatner snorkeling kit  Yeah  Can't remember any of the toys  That we grew up with anymore  But we're talking about like lawn darts  Very dangerous  Now they showed some dangerous stuff  I think those yo-yo things that you just were talking about  That's like a strangling hazard  Sure  Because it's some rubber  I don't know 
[03:09:00]  It's a rubber stretchy thing  On the end of it  It's like a rubber bungee  And on the end of it is a rubber ball  So I guess if you wrap it around your neck  You could strangle yourself with it  But it's nothing these days compared to what they used to sell as toys  And not recall as kids  These things weren't recalled when we were kids  They were out there for us to play with  And be endangered with on a daily basis  Lawn darts  Huge, giant darts  Well lawn darts  They weren't dangerous until you started making up your own game  No, because the game itself is dangerous 
[03:09:30]  It was played like horseshoes  You had to throw the darts kind of at each other  You were at opposite ends of the yard  Or you would stand behind a little circle on the lawn  Yeah, but kind of dangerous  But see, we started getting brave and standing in the circle  Things like that  In the circle  Throwing them real high in the air  So you could barely see where it's coming down  Right  Yeah, those are pretty dangerous  I don't think they make lawn darts anymore  A lot of kids were impaled by the lawn darts over the years  Now they make safe lawn darts or something  It's made out of rubber, the whole thing 
[03:10:00]  It doesn't have a point on it  It had a big metal spike that would go like six inches into your skull  If it hit you  The other one, my favorite, click clacks  Remember those things?  Oh yeah  They were glass balls on the end of strings  With a little loop to hold on to  And what you would do is kind of  Tick, tick, tick, tick  Tick them together  Get them going  And then really start well  And so they'd meet at the top and the bottom  And they would just sometimes explode 
[03:10:30]  Sending shrapnel like you were in the nom  Like a claymore went off  Or  You would smash the side of your head too  Yeah, if you did them wrong  You could smash yourself in the temple with it  One I used to love was a super elastic bubble plastic  Remember super elastic bubble plastic?  Yeah, you blew like bubbles or something?  Yeah, you blew these big bubbles  It came with a tube, this lead tube  Like a toothpaste tube  Full of this chemical 
[03:11:00]  That I'm sure was just the most toxic stuff ever  And you would put a blob of it on the end of a straw  And then blow into the straw  And it would blow this big balloon thing up  Made of super elastic bubble plastic  The problem was  When you were blowing into it  It was fine and dandy  But if you inhaled  Like you took a breath to blow more air in  And some of the air that was already in this  Toxic plastic balloon  Went back into your lungs  Could be a problem 
[03:11:30]  You'd start hacking  Like you had tuberculosis  And God knows what kind of disease you'd get from it  Because it was  It was something from DuPont Chemical  I believe put it out  Are you sure?  Yeah, yeah  I remember reading about it  I wonder why that's not around anymore  Highly toxic  But kids  What kind of cancer is that causing?  I remember a kid down the block  Would chew on it like bubble gum  He'd chew on it  Super elastic bubble plastic  And then there was 
[03:12:00]  Incredible Edibles  What was that again?  Was that  They would give you this  Big monster factory  Or a bug factory  It was called  And you would take these metal plates  And put this goop  They called it goop  In it  And then you'd slide it in  It was almost like a miniature  Easy bake oven kind of thing  But it would use metal coils  To heat this thing up  To a billion degrees or so  And then they'd give you this metal clamp  That you would  Precariously put in the plate  And pull it out 
[03:12:30]  Now you're holding pretty much  A branding iron  On a six inch fork  And if it would touch  Which it would all the time  Touch your hands  You'd smell burning flesh  And you'd have these  Angled metal burn marks  In your hands  This was a toy  For kids  It plugged in  It was hot  And then the bubbling  Little goop that you put in  Would cool down  And you'd have a bug  It was like this plastic bug  But you could eat it  And when you ran out of the goop  You started melting your crayons 
[03:13:00]  Right?  Crayons, yeah  And putting those in there  Because the oven got so hot  It would melt anything  But you were supposed to eat this stuff  And you never knew what it was  The goop came in these plastic tubes  Again  Some kind of chemical  That solidified after you heated it  And let it cool  And then you'd eat it  Look, I'm eating a bug  You had a lot of edible stuff  When you were a kid  And you just didn't know  What the hell it was  Chris from Jersey  What's up?

Oh, yeah  You'd take these  Little things  You'd cut them out of plastic  And put them in your oven  You'd color them in  Put them in the oven  On a cookie sheet  And bake them  And they would shrink  And turn into glass  But sometimes they would explode  And you'd get this  Shrinky dink explosion  Which would leave  Little glass shards 
[03:16:30]  Inside your oven  Cause fires  Mm-hmm  Remember Digger the dog?

[03:18:00]  When I was a boy  Another dangerous  Choking hazard  I would smell them  Though the plastic  Always smelled good  When you first opened them  Oh, that's right  I forgot about that  You'd peel back  The color form  And you smell  I'm weird with  The smell of a brand new  Set of color forms  Fantastic  That was very nice  When you smell new books  You've got to smell  A new book  Especially with shiny pages  I'll smell one  I always hate it  When my face  Leaves grease on the page  But do you ever  Only smell the page once  I can't smell it  More than once  Or I feel like  The smell is gone  It is  Right  Like the little dittos 
[03:18:30]  You'd get in school  When they'd take one  And hand it back  And the pile back  And you'd  You'd smell it  Yeah  But then  Alas  It was gone in a second  Yep  Once you smelled it  Yeah  Dittos  I used to smell it  We so need to take a break  Why would you  Who's on the hotline  Someone's calling in  Oh the Mabel King  Jump rope  Or you could pick up  The Rich Voss

[03:22:00]  Farts equal funny.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Austin Lane.  Do you have eight-pound balls?  Have what?  Eight-pound balls.  I got a nine-pound ball.  Well, I got some eight-pound balls, but they don't have any fingers in them.  You know, you can't have any holes drilled in them yet. 
[03:22:30]  You can actually throw it, you know, without a finger hole if you want to.  Okay, let's start over.  But I've got a nine-pound ball.  Let's start over.  Let's start over.  Do you have eight-pound balls?  I've got some eight-pound balls.  I don't have them drilled yet.  Say yes or no.  Yes or no.  I've got eight-pound balls, yeah, but they're not drilled yet.  Just say yes or no.  Do you have eight-pound balls?  Can you understand English or not? 
[03:23:00]  I said I have some brand-new eight-pound balls that don't have finger holes drilled.  But we're just asking you.  Say yes or no.  We don't care about the holes.  Oh, yes.  I have three of them.  Yeah.  Then where do you buy your underwear?  You suck.  You jerk.  What's the definition of making love? 
[03:23:30]  That's what a woman's doing while a guy's fucking her.  Why do women have two sets of lips?  So they can piss and moan.  The greatest thing being when the ladies moan at the joke.  That's okay.  A couple wakes up one morning. 
[03:24:00]  The wife says,  I had a dream last night.  It was Christmas.  And the tree was decorated with penises.  Long ones, short ones, black ones, white ones, circumcised, uncircumcised.  At the top of the tree was the perfect penis.  I said, is that mine?  She said, now yours was being hid by one of those little lights.  I said, well, I had a dream myself. 
[03:24:30]  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Christmas time.  This tree was decorated with vaginas.  Little ones, big ones.  Bushy ones.  Shaved ones.  And at the top of the tree was the perfect vagina.  She said, was that mine?  He said, no, they were using yours as the tree stand.  How do you turn a fox into a cow?  Marry her. 
[03:25:00]  It's the O&A virus.  XM 202.  XM News, Talk, Sports, and Information.  It's everything all the time.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not. 
[03:25:30]  You sightless trot.  Your dog just shit on my rug.  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't do sketches, stupid.  He said, I go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I've made.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now go away.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  I'm doing the best that I've made.  I'm doing the best I ever did.  Now go away. 
[03:26:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  What would you do for a MiFi?  Oh, yeah.  You can send in an email after the show to opianthony.com.  I think we'll give him one away a week for the next five or six weeks.  Something like that.  One a week.  Well, we get so many memos and emails, it gets all confusing.  Who does?  You?  You get a lot of those?  Yeah.  I don't pay much attention.  Because your email box has been filled up for about three months.  Everyone I care about has my email address that I use. 
[03:26:30]  The other one?  You don't care about the listeners?  You don't read their emails?  You read them.  You tell me everything I need to know.  That's pretty much it.  That mailbox has been full.  You know why?  Remember, I did empty it once.  I really did.  I emptied it out, and I started looking into it.  And to sort through one person that's a fan of the show, I had to go through about 50 Viagra,  Spam, Sialis, real estate, fake Rolexes. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Your mortgage has been approved.  I need help in Zimbabwe.  Please send me your bank account number.  Arafat's wife just emailed me, by the way, with one of those.  Oh, really?  I answered her back.  Nice.  All right.  Make some money in the transaction.  So you can send an email to opianthony.com and tell us what you would do for a MiFi.  We've got some good ones so far.  Let's say hi to Marvin the Trucker. 
[03:27:30]  What's up, Marvin?  Hey, guys.  I want to know exactly when are y'all going to get real comedy in there?  Hmm.  When are we all going to get real comedy in there?  What do you consider real comedy, Marvin?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.  Oh, very good, Jim.  Yeah.  What makes you laugh there, Marvin?  Well, I don't know, but I know one thing.  Y'all more or less sound like Bob and Tom right now, if y'all ever heard. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, my God.  I've never heard those.  To be very honest, I've never heard Bob and Tom.  They laugh at the stupid shit.  I hear they're terrific, Marvin.  I hear those guys are terrific.  Bob and Tom, huh?  Marvin?  Yeah.  Marvin, we ask you what makes you laugh, and you go, I don't know, but you have to know  what makes you laugh.  Apparently funny people, which you're not.  Marvin, you're not an example.  You're not answering the question.  You're being a passive-aggressive hillbilly.  We're giving you a chance to speak, and you're not. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, you're being very hurtful.  A hillbilly?  Yeah.  I do believe we make people laugh every day, so to say we're not funny.  Y'all do have.  Maybe our sense of humor is not your cup of tea.  So we're saying, yeah.  What makes you laugh, Marvin?  What makes you laugh?  Let's go.  What makes me laugh?  Yes.  Give us a movie, a TV show, a comic, something that makes you laugh.  I can't think of the guy that you had on there a while back ago that sings, and y'all 
[03:29:00]  had him go down to the restaurant and everything.  Oh, John Valby.  Yes.  Now, he was terrific.  Yeah, but John Valby also laughs while he's doing it, just like Bob and Tom, and just like  Opie and Anthony.  No, but he's funny.  But he's funny.  You two guys aren't.  There's more than two of us.  We ain't got to get rid of one of you guys and get him in there.  Not your cup of tea, Marv?  I don't know.  You like a little music behind your comedy, do you?  You prefer a little background music in the comedy? 
[03:29:30]  Play that hillbilly song.  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  We're not going to play.  We don't have a hillbilly song.  We don't carry that garbage.  And you definitely don't sound like a hillbilly, so why would we play the hillbilly song?  Y'all called me hillbilly a minute ago.  Listen to you.  You're a dumb guy.  And I'm not even being funny.  Thank you.  You're a dummy.  Okay.  Thank you.  There you go.  Good comeback.  Sadly, sir, I'm paying $2 extra for you guys, so I must be a rookie.  You really are?  Because that's probably four hours worth of work for you, you fucking minimum wage idiot. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, fuck you.  Minimum wage my ass.  Hey, minimum wage my ass.  You fucking, you are stupid.  What do you do for a living, Marvin?  What do you do?  What do I do?  Yeah.  I'm a trucker.  All right.  Well, we can't shit on truckers.  Yeah, we like most truckers.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I don't hear y'all shitting on truckers all the time.  No, you don't, stupid.  You do not.  You're a hick and a liar.  At least stop being a liar.  The truckers are keeping this show alive.  You kidding me?  They've been spreading the virus all over America for us.  You're a filthy liar. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, okay.  I don't hear y'all here talking about truck drivers.  I don't hear y'all here talking about truck drivers.  Yeah, you really are.  You make the blue-collar tour sound like Woody Allen.  You really are a fucking dummy, Marvin.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Thank you.  Marvin, if you had a sense of humor, you would be laughing, because that's really...  That's a great line.  That's a great line.  And you sat there in your rig and your awful hemorrhoids and just took it and went,  Thank you.  Thank you.  You sound like half of Carol Burnett's sketches, you aggravating...  Oh, what the hell, y'all have a merry Christmas and fuck you. 
[03:31:00]  There you go.  All right.  All right, Marvin.  Bye.  I hate the people that complain.  It's only $2.  I don't mind them complaining.  If you don't like the show, then cancel them.  What can I tell you?  Beat it.  The only thing we say about truckers is that they go on and on because they're kind of lonely  out there.  That's it.  That's the only thing.  That's not shitting on them.  Not at all.  I hear you shitting on the truckers all the time.  Let me tell you.  Oh, God, that guy with that voice. 
[03:31:30]  He's a fool.  I've got to put on my hood and talk about the trigger.  You concrete walkers.  Look at you people with all your fancy equipment like shoes and socks and whatnot.  You people think you's better than me because you do things like get haircuts and clip your  fingernails.  Well, let me tell you something.  Just because you have evolution and it hasn't made it to my part of the state yet. 
[03:32:00]  Just because you walk upright don't mean you's better than me.  Just because you come down from the trees don't mean you's better, smarter than me.  Oh, brother.  I think we gave our listeners $2 worth of humor today.  Two bucks.  Two lousy dollars.  That's a whole month's worth.  That Marvin really stinks. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, we figured it out.  How much is it a day?  Seven cents a day?  Seven cents a day.  You don't think you got seven cents worth of humor today?  Fat Sally Struthers doesn't even ask for that much.  The rumor is, that's one Jim Norton line.  That's one funny phone call.  That's it.  That's seven cents.  How about this, Marvin?  We're in bonus time now.  If you're not enjoying the show, why don't you drink a fifth of whiskey and then drunk  drive into a school bus?  Why don't you do that?  Why don't you flip your rig into a school bus?  All right.  Just plow through it.  Jeff, what's up? 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, that guy was just trying to give this truck driver a bad name.  He's a fucking moron hillbilly.  That guy was fucking terrible.  He's a retard.  See, I like your southern accent a lot better than Marvin's.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a northerner anyway.  I'm not a southier.  We're all learning about each other here.  You know, I'm not going to lie to you.  You know, being from the east coast and we hear someone like Marvin, it's kind of foreign  to us.  Yeah.  There's probably people out there listening to that going, he talks completely normal. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  I gots to go.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  Bye.  I gots to go and Steve across on some Trigger's lawn.  Nice.  Come on.  Nothing.  Steve across?  Oh, I didn't even get it.  What kind of fucking memories do you have around here?  I said earlier, we have ADD on this show.  I thought it was some kind of a...  Are we making Steve...  Steve across.  Fire.  Steve.  He's burning.  You see his hat?  I got that.  Are you a Kiss fan, Steve? 
[03:34:00]  Extremely.  Did you like when Gene Simmons would spit one of your shoes out on stage?  I'm not laughing because I don't get it.  Everyone's in a welder.  Oh, Steve.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  I get it now.  I have to sit through silence.  I'm not going to now let you get a laugh.  When you say...  It was in the same gag.  Wait, we did Steve jokes today?  I really thought that that was an expression because you were saying Cheggers lawn.  So Steve will look close on Cheggers lawn.  Let's say hi to Richard, the trucker.  I had silence there.  I'm staring at deer looking back at me.  Someone out there got it. 
[03:34:30]  That's right.  What was that line you had?  I would have had a high-pitched whistle.  You would have tilted your heads at me.  Richard, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing this morning?  Good.  Good.  Jimmy, how are you doing?  Fine, thank you, Richard.  How are you?  I'm doing okay.  Atta boy.  I just wanted to call you guys up.  Redeemed truckers in the ice, Boney.  All right.  Not all of us are stupid southern heads from some little infant spread little town. 
[03:35:00]  Some of us are college educated from up north.  All right.  You know, we love the truckers.  Yeah, we have a good relationship with the truckers.  We understand.  You know, we have to teach you guys to keep it brief.  That's about it.  Just because one trucker was a dick doesn't mean all truckers are dicks.  We can understand that.  By the way, people, remember, seven cents a day, that's it.  Seven cents a day.  Make us feel better about ourselves.  Did we give you seven cents worth of humor today? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  What else can you get for seven cents a day?  Nothing.  Seven lousy cents.  The guy's bitching about two bucks.  That's for the whole month.  Right?  You can't even feed one of those little spoiled, fly-ridden brats for seven cents.  They ask for more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Rob the trucker, what's up?  Hey, Norton.  How's it going?  Hi, Rob.  Hey, guys.  You know, I listen to you guys when you're in New York and in Boston.  I've been, you know, trucking the East Coast for a long time.  But, you know, you listen to some of these Southern guys. 
[03:36:00]  They just don't get it.  They have no clue whatsoever what's going on.  You can't just say Southern guys, because there's a lot of Southern guys listening to  the show and they get it.  There's a lot of Southern guys.  Well, no.  You listen to them.  They have no clue.  Everybody that calls, you guys need to do something different.  All right.  All right.  You know.  I think they're into a little more of the traditional comedy.  You know, like an episode of Gilligan's Island or something.  You know.  At least I know where it's to laugh, because they put in the laughs in there for you. 
[03:36:30]  You hear the people laughing, and I knows to laugh at them parts, like when Gilligan  screws up.  Then you hear the ha-ha-ha on the TV, and I know to go ha-ha-ha there at my home.  Did we do Gilligan's Island jokes earlier?  No.  No.  We hadn't touched on that.  Kevin from the city.  What's up?  Hey, ONA.  How are you?  Good.  Mail the radio out of coconut. 
[03:37:00]  Why can't you fix the hole in the boat?  Ha-ha-ha.  That okay.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Yeah.  It's funny when these guys like Marvin call up and say, you guys don't say anything funny.  You know, when guys like that call, you don't really have to say anything funny.  Just listen to that moron talk.  It's entertainment in itself.  Yeah, I want to thank Marvin.  He gave everyone seven cents of humor today.  He sure did.  That's where my seven cents is going today.  As bad as you guys are, I guess he's still paying the two bucks a month, so I guess who's  the joker?  I bet he is.  And someone like Marvin will continue listening. 
[03:37:30]  Thank you, Marvin.  John from Kansas City.  Yeah.  Like you guys.  Oh, thank you.  Once we got used to listening to your funny sounding accent, you're pretty funny.  I know.  See?  I am.  I'm telling you, it works both ways.  They're listening to us like, listen to these freaking New Yorkers.  It certainly does.  All right.  Thank you, John.  You bet.  Marvin Nash.  I like to cut his ear off.  Please, please.  Don't throw Steve's shoes on me.  Oh, wow.  Now, see? 
[03:38:00]  Damn it.  I laughed and I wasn't going to laugh.  Hate when you're funny.  That was funny.  I know.  It was a Steve fire joke.  We were doing Steve fire jokes today?  I get a look.  We haven't done fire jokes in a while, have we?  A mongoloid looking at a Ferris wheel.  But someone out there laughed.  They definitely laughed at that one.  Probably Marvin.  Okay.  All right.  What else?  Marvin Nash.  What else?  Wow.  We're running out of things to talk about.  Oh, boy.  How do I look?  Well, we have the Nicolas Cage picture, but that's more of a visual. 
[03:38:30]  Looks like he's dating a 12-year-old.  Yeah, he's dragging a miscarriage with him.  Married to a child.  Because he's a tall guy.  What is he, 6'1"?  And he's married to some little Asian girl?  They're married?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're married now.  They're married.  She's only 22 or something like that?  21 or 22.  21 or 22.  Really young.  How old is he?  He's got to be upper 40s by now, right?  Yeah.  Around forever.  Yeah.  And they're walking down the street, and they've got a picture of them together. 
[03:39:00]  And it looks ridiculous.  It looks like he is walking with a small Asian child.  It looks like Oedipus in Thailand.  Holy ass.  What did he ever do to you?  I love Oedipus.  It was a good line.  In Thailand.  It was a great one.  Where you can get a little bit of anything you want.  Sure can.  Can't tell if they're enjoying it or if they're hurting.  Expression never changes.  We should get this up online.  Yeah.  She's half his size. 
[03:39:30]  Wow.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, that's more of a visual, unfortunately.  See, if we had these cameras on, we could quickly show the people.  Oh.  Good point, Opie.  You can just hold it right up there.  Hold it right up and go see what we're talking about.  When will that be discussed?  Maybe in the meeting after the show.  We have a little phone.  Oh, my God.  We have that stupid night.  It's going to be a great meeting.  I remember a meeting that goes nowhere.  Can I be in on it?  I remember and I hate it.  Of course you're in on it.  I have a lot of questions I want to ask.  We all have a lot of questions.  We ask them all the time and we just, they just keep circling, circling, circling, circling, 
[03:40:00]  circling, circling, circling back.  Are they going to circle back?  Circling and circling and circling.  Or tee it up?  Circling.  I don't know.  Who knows?  I'm going to bring the bell into the meeting and give one every time one of those good  boy cliches are used.  Father's surprise.  Call girl, daughter.  Uh-oh.  Is this a true story or is this one of these weekly world news stories?  I think it's true.  I'm praying it's true.  I don't see AP, so I'm not buying it. 
[03:40:30]  Is this true, Ben?  Where'd you get this?  You're asking Ben if it's true?  Yeah.  I got it from...  A listener sent it.  A listener sent it.  No, it's legit.  We use that news service every now and then.  What is the news service?  It's from the UK.  It's from the UK.  Oh, boy.  The UK always.  Oh, no.  Okay.  There's always...  Whenever you go to Drudge, if there's some big sensational headline like Cure for Cancer  or something is up there and you click on it, it always brings you to some UK 
[03:41:00]  site.  Some UK news site where it's like bull that you'll never hear of a week later.  Well, all right.  Father surprise, call girl, daughter.  An Israeli couple are preparing to divorce after the man summoned a prostitute to his  hotel room only to discover she was his daughter.  What are the odds of that, though?  Come on.  Yeah, that seems a little far-fetched.  The tale of family turmoil began some months ago when the father, a businessman based in  the city of Haifa, was sent by his company to a course in the resort of Eilat for four 
[03:41:30]  days, the Israeli newspaper, the Israeli newspaper, Mariv, Mariv.  Sound it out.  Ma?  Sound it out.  Arav?  Ma Arav?  M-A-A-R-I-V?  Oh.  This has got to be a fake story.  Reports that the man took advantage of the visit to summon a call girl to his room on  his first night there, and that was when everything started to go horribly wrong. 
[03:42:00]  His name, Jimmy Norton.  As the prostitute entered the room, the full horror for him of discovering his daughter's  occupation hit him.  The father began feeling chest pains, which may have been a mild heart attack, Anthony.  That'll do it.  He then cut short his stay in Eilat, and on his return home, told his distraught wife  the truth of what had happened.  Why was he distraught?  The luck of having one of them at home?  Getting it for free?  God almighty, I could save a fortune if I was in that situation.  Oh, listen to the mom, Anthony.  How would she?  She has vowed to track down her daughter and find a more suitable job for her. 
[03:42:30]  Ah.  However, her forgiveness has not extended to her husband, and she has made it clear she  wishes to divorce him.  And the court case is expected to begin soon.  I don't believe that.  A hooker has to know your name before they come up to your room.  Well, how'd she not recognize her own dad's name?  You understand?  I mean, if I called for a hooker and my mom walked in, well, no, it's not.  I mean, I was like, eh.  In hindsight, lighting the match wasn't a good idea. 
[03:43:00]  Remember that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A few years back, maybe 10 years ago.  Yeah, that was pretty much.  That was reported as a real story.  That's right.  It was reported as a real story years ago.  It's gone away now, but years ago, this was the story.  Everyone sent and said it was a true story.  But real news organizations reported as a real story.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  And it was not real.  I think it started in one of the L.A. papers.  And it would change, like little subtle things would change every time you read it. 
[03:43:30]  Maybe a name.  Maybe a location.  But it was the story of a guy that came into a hospital.  Two gay guys.  Two gay guys.  And one guy had a burnt face.  And the other guy had burnt intestinal tract and rectum.  And the doctor asked how it happened.  And the guy told him the story.  They had put a gerbil up the guy's ass.  They had tied a string to his tail.  And Richard Gere bent over.  That old gag. 
[03:44:00]  And they put the gerbil up the guy's ass.  And it's supposed to stimulate the guy, the gerbil, running around in there, tickling your prostate.  But the string is hanging out.  So when you want to get him, you pull the string and pull the gerbil back out.  Well, Opie, the string must have come off the gerbil's tail or wherever it was tied.  They couldn't get the gerbil out.  So one of the guys figured he would go in himself manually and find the gerbil.  So the guy bends over.  His pal gets down there to help him out and opens up. 
[03:44:30]  And he's looking in.  But alas, alas, it's too dark in there.  The guy had a broken nose, too, by the way.  I do remember.  Right.  A broken nose.  You remember, right?  This is not an idea in a bit.  This was actually rapport is a real story.  I just remembered not only a burnt face, a broken nose.  Yeah.  That's key to the story.  But go ahead.  And that's where the line, in hindsight, lighting the match wasn't a good idea.  Because he lit a match to see what was going on up there. 
[03:45:00]  And he had methane gas that was built up, like lighting a fart.  And it set his whole intestinal tract on fire.  And in that happening, it launched the gerbil out like a cannonball, straight into the other  gay guy's face, breaking his nose and burning his face and causing burns to the other gentleman's  intestine and rectum.  But that one was being, you know, every jock was on the air, too, saying, hey, well, listen 
[03:45:30]  to this story.  Ho, ho.  Light of the match was a bad idea.  I'd like to see anybody do that story these days on regular radio.  It ain't gonna happen.  It ain't gonna happen.  But there were jocks and news organizations saying that that was true.  And there were a bunch of stories like that out there.  What was the other one?  There was the girl that was masturbating with a lobster tail.  Oh, that's more of the urban legend story.  Oh, no, that one was being reported as news.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  What happened? 
[03:46:00]  And then the eggs, like, hatched in her vag.  A few days later or weeks later, whatever the hell.  The timeline's never right.  She had abdominal pains, went to the hospital, they put her in the stirrups and opened her  up, and all of a sudden these baby lobsters just started pouring out of her snatch.  That's cruel.  Because as she was masturbating with it, it laid eggs.  Right.  And the other one is the woman that, oh, let's think about this.  It gives me a heebie-jeebie.  What?  She had a boil on her tongue, and she went to the doctor, and they lanced it, and all of 
[03:46:30]  a sudden maggots started pouring out of her tongue, and they couldn't believe where it  came from.  They didn't know where it came from, and they tracked it down to her licking an envelope  and getting a paper cut from the envelope, and the envelope was so old, sitting on the  shelf, that flies had laid their eggs on the blue.  Stop.  And when she did that, it cut her and put a fly egg in her tongue. 
[03:47:00]  Those are all stories, though, that people talk about like they're true.  They're not so much like the urban legends of the wedding, where they turn over the plate,  and there's a picture of the bride having sex with the best man.  Because these are supposed to be news stories.  Right.  I'll tell you a true one.  This did happen.  No, it didn't.  Shut up.  Absolutely.  I'm just saying that.  This is all about parasites and stuff, and this one guy was somewhere in the woods,  and he fell, and he got these weird parasites in his skin, and they burrow under your skin,  and they were all the way up his arm and his chest. 
[03:47:30]  And they're like little maggots, but you could actually see them move under the skin.  Stop it.  And he itched.  He couldn't sleep for seven months.  I mean, he slept, but it was on and off.  Captain Kirk, they put creatures in our bodies.  Creatures in your body?  They put them, check them.  And they'd crawl around.  That was true, yeah.  It was just the same.  It was the whole story.  But they really were a little parasites.  All right.  In honor of Gerbil Guy, why don't we play Steve Lynch's Gerbil?  We'll come back without taking a break, and we'll finish the show with what I learned 
[03:48:00]  and all that stuff.  Let's see what kind of education you people got today.  Yeah, why not?  Hit that.  I bought a Gerbil at the petting zoo If Richard Gere can do it, I can too  I get undressed, I start to lube I stick the Gerbil in the end of the tube  Wondering just how he'll feel Will he like it better than his little wheel? 
[03:48:30]  Careful now, he's right beside me One more inch and he's inside me  Gold, Gerbil, gold  Burrow harder, burrow deeper Be my little chimney sweeper  One thing I forgot about How am I supposed to get you out? 
[03:49:00]  So now my Gerbil's on easy street It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat  The situation is beyond my control Gotta find a way to get him out of his hole 
[03:49:30]  I try crowbars, I try wires I almost had him with a pair of pliers  I try cheese But he's not biting I wish this wasn't so exciting  Gold, Gerbil, gold  Jesus, I am such a sucker Please get out you furry fucker 
[03:50:00]  I think I am getting ill Suddenly he's very, very still  Now it's too late, my Gerbil died I guess I have committed Gerbicide 
[03:50:30]  Here's some advice It's very clear cut If you love your Gerbil  Don't stick him up your butt Don't stick him up your butt  Little fairy Gerbil in your bloody hole  Don't stick him up your butt  And I won't come out  And I won't come out  And I won't come out 
[03:51:00]  And I stay up  And I stay up  And I stay up  And I stay up  Yeah  Stephen Lynch, the gerbil song on the Opie and Anthony show.  As we limp to the finish line here.  Any more Stephen Lynch songs we can play that make sense?  Yeah, that one was topical.  Yes, of course, because I'm smart.  I'm smart.  JP from Long Island, what's up, buddy?  Sitting in that chair, I'll hunch down.  I'm smart. 
[03:51:30]  What a waste.  Not dumb like everyone says.  Come out in my boat and shoot him.  Are you falling asleep over there?  Not at all, Opie.  Just stretched out, thinking and listening.  He's relaxing.  Doesn't help the mood of the show here.  We're all tired and you're looking real tired.  Dude, I'm tired.  I've been up since yesterday afternoon.  I have a little cyst on my back, which I've had for three years.  You do?  It's nothing.  It's fatty.  Right by where my back meets my...  Your ass crack?  Yeah.  Like your tailbone?  Might be an extra nipple.  That's nothing.  I had a doctor.  That's a common thing.  People get that, but it hurts really bad. 
[03:52:00]  Mine's not bad.  It's just if I'm just sitting on it with my belt digging into it.  Got a fat knuckle in my back.  Let's see what JP has.  Smell when you rub it.  No.  Let's see what JP has.  JP!  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, I wanted to bust on that, man.  Why?  He moved from, you know, Huntington.  He moves up to Great Neck.  I went from Huntington to Brooklyn to Great Neck, my friend.  That's right.  Might as well stay in Brooklyn with the Jews, because that is the crankiest area ever.  Oh, I agree wholeheartedly.  I love my cranky new neighborhood. 
[03:52:30]  I don't talk to anybody.  I just have to, the only thing I really have to deal with is old Jewish ladies trying to  make sure they don't lose out five cents at cash registers.  The one good thing, dude, you got to admit, before they get old, you got some hot Jewish  moms up there.  I don't know.  I haven't seen any.  I just see old Jewish people.  Dude, look around.  They're up there.  You know what, though?  There's Indians, too.  Not the woo-woo-woo Indians.  There's the, you know, the high-end dot-head Indians, the ones that become doctors and stuff. 
[03:53:00]  Mercedes-Benz style.  Yeah.  So it's, oh, God, who farted, Jimmy?  Holy crap, dude.  No one did.  Holy Jesus.  Jesus, dude.  That's a bad one.  Holy shit, I can't breathe.  Steve, spray it right on him.  That's what we do now.  What are you doing?  I didn't do anything.  You're lying.  You're a lying cussing.  Dude, why do you have to fart every morning?  Oh, my God.  It smells like a dog took a dump on the rug.  My whole stomach is percolating because I'm trying to hold him in. 
[03:53:30]  I'm trying to be nice about it.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  I like my cranky neighborhood.  Chris from Jersey.  What's up, Chris?  I got an early.  What did you learn, guys?  Oh, good.  Let's get moving here.  I learned that the C and C and TV is combustible.  Oh, very good.  Hey, Jimmy.  Sir, please.  I'm asking where you're playing this weekend.  Oh, I'm actually going to be a little bit, probably at the Comedy Cellar.  I don't care.  No, I know that.  I don't care.  It's really funny.  But if you want to find out where I'll be, December 23rd, I'll be in Long Island at 
[03:54:00]  the downtown.  Oh, that's right.  Oh.  The only gig I have local until the end of the year.  Rob from Long Island.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Opie's having a BYO tea party at his house.  That's right.  On your own table.  Nice.  That's good.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Philly.  Hey, Ryan.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Boo Boo.  Hi, Ryan.  I learned that the O and A humor is for the Blue State Truckers.  Blue State Truckers.  I think some of the Red States get the humor.  Oh, they do. 
[03:54:30]  All right.  Hey, Ryan.  Yes, caller.  Wait, what's he doing?  What was that?  A bit?  I don't know.  Was he trying to do a bit?  I think he was.  Oh, he was getting himself?  Sex bagels telling us?  Okay.  Mike from Jersey.  Today I learned that the Jews who live near Ant sound a lot like Bela Lugosi.  Ooh.  Also, he learned that if Master Poe is Kevin Costner, then Opie is definitely Whitney Houston.  I learned the show is much more enjoyable to do with the FHM Lingerie World Tour 2004 in front of you. 
[03:55:00]  This, what's her name?  Sophie Monk?  Unbelievable, right?  The blonde?  Yeah.  Where did she come from?  I have no idea.  She's been, the page has been opened in front of me for the entire show, and what a distraction.  And that's why the people didn't get their seven cents today.  That's pretty much it, because it's Sophie Monk.  It has a little Bridgette Bardot in her.  Yeah.  The young version of Bridgette Bardot, obviously.  Not the animal rights activist pig. 
[03:55:30]  Very hot.  Bridgette Bardot proves that time is a bitch.  Yeah.  Time is a bitch.  Perhaps checking out in your youth is not all that bad in hindsight.  Johnny from Dallas, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to say hi to Boo Boo.  Absolutely love you, Jimmy.  But I learned today that apparently you're drawing a clit on your back.  Thank you, Cuddles.  Very good.  Jason from Massachusetts. 
[03:56:00]  What's up, Jason?  Today I learned to not take a break when you guys are going to break.  Oh, very good.  Yes.  I almost have been pissed.  He is not happy.  He's calming down, though.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, fella.  Thank you, sir.  That was very uncomfortable.  If you're just tuning in, you might want to listen to the Master Poe stuff in the replay.  T-Bones from Boston.  I learned that Master Poe fought a hurricane, and it sued him.  Jerry Lee Lewis from Whackbag.  He learned Anthony can't be harmed by Master Poe because he's an 18 sorcerer who can conjure 
[03:56:30]  up large balls of Steve.  Yeah.  A conjure, I know.  Shut up.  Jimmy's all ready to pounce.  Shut up.  Yeah, he.  Because I was laughing, and I couldn't even say the word.  This guy from Tennessee.  I saw you coming at me.  Trust me.  Jimmy's teeth were bared, and he's ready to pounce.  I saw you coming, and I just threw that freaking dog bone.  Relax.  I saw you.  Dude, when somebody puts the emphasis on the wrong syllable, you know how hard that is. 
[03:57:00]  I laughed.  I laughed.  To conjure.  Conjure.  I know.  I know it's conjure.  Scott from Tennessee.  I like the soup doozier.  Hey, guys.  You guys rock.  That one I knew I was messing up, all right?  As I was saying it.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hey, guys.  Y'all rock.  Thank you.  I learned today that two or three Southern or a handful of Southern drivers makes us all  look stupid.  Goddamn right on that one.  But we, uh, there is a good state to get you, y'all.  This is the greatest show ever, so.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Hi, man.  Mike from Jersey.  You learned that starving Africans are spoiled, fly-ridden nothings. 
[03:57:30]  Ooh.  Uh, Garfield Mark from Jersey.  I learned on the O&A show today, according to Opie, only two years, 43 weeks, and a few  days until O&A F up and retire.  Uh, Jerry Lou.  Oh, we did that one already.  Okay.  Ow.  Let's see.  Uh, Kevin in Richmond, Virginia.  Yeah.  Kevin.  Hey.  Hey.  What I learned today was, oh, it isn't adrenaline, it's pussy juice.  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  We did learn that.  I showed Anthony during the commercial break.  I was shaking pretty good today.  Jacob, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that, uh, it's not until the ink dries on the death certificate.  Punching out.  Oh, it's not funny until the ink dries on the death certificate.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  Uh, Rick from Greenville.  Cool.  What's up, Rick?  Hey, guys.  You guys rock, man.  Thank you.  You should, uh, audition as a stand-in on the new Leary Show, Rescue Me.  Nice.  Nice.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm out. 
[03:58:30]  He's out?  Damn Yankee the trucker.  What's up, Damn Yankee?  Yeah, today I learned Master Paul has a hard time with our legal system.  Yeah, I did learn that, too.  Very good.  All right.  How much time we got in the booth there?  About a minute and a half.  You're kidding.  Five minutes.  Paul, 30 seconds.  What can we do in 30 seconds, Anthony?  I thought we were doing just fine, reading, uh, what did we learn?  I think they're fun.  All right, Mike learned the scab-type nose pickings are thin and delicious, and little 
[03:59:00]  Jimmy can pull an entire Haitian family out of his nose.  Oh.  God, it just got hot in here?  Yeah.  Oh, no, Steve just walked in.  Sorry.  Fire!  Because it was cold all day, and then Steve came in, and all of a sudden, whoa.  Bill from Jersey, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Master Paul's got Steve's shoes in his eyes, because he's crazy.  This was a very giddy show today.  Yeah.  We'll do it again tomorrow.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Proposed we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture. 
[03:59:30]  The O-B-N-H.  If people spell their name however they want, it has nothing to do with phonics or nothing.  Not sure what phonics is, but I saw the girl that was hooked on it.  She's got a problem with it, apparently.  Have you seen that commercial?  Hooked on phonics.  Work for me.  She's adorable, you know.  I was thinking, wouldn't that be weird if she was applying what she learned and she couldn't 
[04:00:00]  get the commercial straight, you know?  Hook it on phonics.  Working for me.  Hook it on phonics.  Working for me.  Me.  Okay, cut.  You talk to her, mate.  We ain't gonna move a lot of tapes this way. 
[04:00:30]  Telling you right now.  Anyway, I met this woman.  Her name was Amy.  You know, so I go, oh, A-M-Y.  She goes, no, A-Y-M-I-E.  Oh.  I have to take a nap.  I'm Brian.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N.  The number seven, the letter Q.  Look at my name tag.  It's big.  You know, I started out in showbiz in about 19, really, I'd say 46, but actually it was 
[04:01:00]  1944 when my front yard, my grandfather bought me a cowboy uniform.  And they told me, don't slip in a dog poo-poo.  And I did.  And I just kept slipping in it and falling.  And they just laughed.  It was beautiful.  And that was my first comedy routine. 
[04:01:30]  And I've just been slipping in shit ever since.  Trying to get what else.  What if you could give the ultimate Major League Baseball fan access to every team all season long?
