<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the usual chaotic banter, featuring sexually explicit and violent jokes from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to promoting two videos available on their website and YouTube. The first showcased E-Rock, a show staffer, undergoing a graphic armpit wax.  The second, created by Derek, hilariously combined E-Rock’s waxing audio with a gay porn star’s narration, resulting in the awkwardly titled "E-Rock meets Diesel Washington."  Anthony then boasted about his viral video of him destroying a Vista disc, expressing a growing preference for online video content over their radio show.  A caller, Freddie, accused them of stealing the waxing bit from Howard Stern.  The hosts also discussed listener calls related to "Whip-em-Out Wednesday," a segment encouraging women to flash drivers with "wow" stickers.

A substantial segment focused on frustrating questions men receive from their girlfriends, prompting numerous listener calls sharing similar experiences and humorous coping mechanisms.  Jim Norton’s girlfriend, nicknamed the "Diaper Astronaut," was a major topic of conversation due to her unconventional behavior, including a cross-country trip to confront someone wearing a diaper to avoid bathroom breaks.

The show also covered Colleen Shipman, an astronaut accused of attempted murder, detailing her alleged cross-country drive to avoid detection and eventual apprehension.  This segued into a discussion about a paparazzi photo of Tyra Banks that sparked weight criticism, and the hosts’ "ONA pests" (listeners) creating and displaying a sign insulting Banks, which was subsequently covered by E! News's "Daily Ten."  The hosts discussed various regional factions within the ONA pests, using humorous, offensive acronyms.  The E-Rock waxing video montage was replayed, followed by listener calls detailing the show's impact, including one listener nearly losing their job from laughing too hard.  A proposed Albany law fining people using electronic devices while crossing the street was met with the hosts’ skepticism. A listener bragged about a sexual encounter, and "Patty Boy from the Bronx" called in, claiming to be high on cocaine and boasting about waiting for a prostitute.

A lengthy discussion on "Bodies...The Exhibition" followed, with a representative from the New York City exhibition joining in studio, bringing a preserved brain and liver for examination.  Callers shared their experiences at various "Bodies" exhibitions, some noting differences between locations.  The show featured a phone interview with "Bodies" representatives, who described the exhibit in detail, including poses like a basketball player and runner. They emphasized the no-photography rule.  The segment was repeatedly interrupted by electric shocks experienced by the hosts and a studio guest (possibly Jim Norton), leading to unrelated tangents about personal lives, the ethics of the exhibition, and increasingly bizarre and vulgar conversations.  Hangovers and remedies were also discussed.

The show's conclusion was dramatically altered by Anthony's sudden and severe illness.  While the broadcast started with banter including the Tyra Banks banner incident, it quickly shifted to Anthony's violent illness, with the audio capturing his vomiting and the sounds of him using the toilet.  Opie and the other on-air personalities provided comedic commentary on Anthony's distress,  dominating the remainder of the segment and effectively ending the show early.  Further segments were mentioned as possibly being completed later, but Anthony's illness became the dominant focus.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  What fast?  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  See hee.  Ovi.  Ovi, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him. 
[00:00:30]  But with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, he had a curse.  Oh, he had a curse.  Did I hear a curse?  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop whining. 
[00:01:30]  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You're going to be okay.  He fell off the toilet.  He's so close.  He's so close.  Quiet.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Ovi and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  That's a montage of E-Rock getting waxed from the other day.  A what?  Yeah, he did it.  Yeah, of course he did.  He's got a weak voice ever since he got his waxing.  An armpit waxing.  Yeah, the video was great.  Yeah, Sam.  There was a version up on YouTube that was like five minutes long.  And it was fine.  It was cool to check out.  But we're smart.  We know what YouTube's all about.  And break.com.  And gorilla mask.net.  And opiananthony.com.  Quick hits.  Quick hits. 
[00:02:30]  Gotta hit them hard and fast.  Short attention span.  So they took the five minutes of E-Rock getting waxed.  And they made it into a montage that's about a minute.  Yeah.  I think a minute 20.  Something like that.  Perfect.  It's up on opiananthony.com.  All our videos are up on YouTube.  We're trying to get break.com to throw it on their front page.  I think this one could go viral.  It's good.  Believe me.  When he finally gets that armpit hair waxed.  Yeah.  And falls off the chair into the wall. 
[00:03:00]  Well, the chair was the toilet.  Oh, the chair was the toilet.  That's right.  And he's topless.  I call it a chair.  Because sometimes I just do my business sitting in a chair.  And he falls off the toilet against the wall and then onto the floor.  And then you get to see that scene about three or four times in a row.  It's really, really funny.  Yeah.  Throw opiananthony in the old YouTube search engine or go to opiananthony.com.  But we want to try to get this one to go viral.  Because it is really funny. 
[00:03:30]  I just played it over and over again last night while I was watching that dumb American Idol, which has become a bore fest.  Well, one thing you do when you put together a YouTube video, it seems, is the real funny part.  You kind of repeat it a few times.  Yeah, yeah.  And then there's also the slow motion one that I think should be added to the end.  It's perfect.  I'm not criticizing.  It is perfect.  Because it's E-Rock falling off the toilet, screaming in pain like five times in a row. 
[00:04:00]  That same last one.  Blah!  Blah!  It's great.  Yeah.  But then to have, like, the last one, him, blah, as he slow-mo falls into the wall might just be the ultimate.  Poor Sam.  He's got to make three or four different versions of this dumb thing.  I use the editing program for my camera.  Sam?  Well, if you like slow motion, I believe there's videos on YouTube of Eric getting hit with dodgeballs in slow motion, too.  Yeah, that's true. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  No, this one, it's the scream like he's getting electrocuted.  And he doesn't want anyone to see that he's in pain, but you just, your body can't help itself.  His chest hair was bad enough, but when they ripped out his armpit hair by the roots, that scream is classic.  Oh, without a doubt.  Yeah, he's gurgling spit.  Spittle.  So, there you go. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, speaking of the Iraq montage, this is the situation we're in by doing two shows a day.  It's actually one big show for us, but...  You did a juggling motion there.  Well, we're constantly juggling.  There's a bit that Derek did, one of our guys behind the scenes, that is so freaking funny, but we cannot play on this part of the Opie and Anthony show.  But I do believe it's up on opiananthony.com.  Oh, right, right.  Is it up there?  What is it labeled as?  Because people really should check this out. 
[00:05:30]  You know, Thad?  Derek took the montage that you just heard that we opened up the show with and added a gay porn star talking about what he would do to a guy.  Yeah, it's labeled gay E-Rock in his a** until he screams a** because his a** is being violated by a big a** from a a**-er.  You know, it's labeled E-Rock meets Diesel Washington. 
[00:06:00]  I don't think, you know, if I'm just kind of like surfing and I see that, I'm not clicking on that.  No, the name doesn't grab me.  Because I don't know who Diesel Washington is.  No.  To me, it's like he plays...  Shame on you.  He says, shame on you.  To me, it sounds like a guy that plays cornerback for the Denver Broncos.  Right.  I don't know who Diesel Washington is.  You don't know him, but by next year, everyone will know him.  Yeah, of course.  I'll name it more appropriately. 
[00:06:30]  It'll take a second or two.  I'm just thinking if you want some hits because this thing Dirk put together is really, really funny because Diesel Washington described in graphic detail what he would do to a man.  Right.  In his business.  That's what he does.  He's a porno star on guy on guy porno.  Yeah.  And he describes what he's going to do, and then after the description, which is very detailed, you hear Iraq screaming and commenting, but his screams and comments are coming from when he got his hair ripped out. 
[00:07:00]  But it fits perfectly in the male gay porno genre.  Oh, boy, does it.  And unfortunately, we cannot play it over here.  No.  And it's really, really funny.  So go to opiananthony.com, and you can check that out.  We throw a lot of things up there that help out the radio show that we never get to.  You throw it against the wall, you see what sticks up.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  Well, your stupid video is all over the place.  I know.  You're an internet video star, Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  Isn't that ridiculous?  I think GorillaMask.net just threw your video up on the front page.  Just put it up.  It's still got legs.  Apparently, a lot of the tech sites have put it up also.  So, you know, the big video sites, it's up there.  It's getting a lot of hits.  But then there's all these little peripheral sites that are putting it up.  A lot of Mac sites are putting it up because they're very excited that I bashed Vista.  Well, basically, you got Vista.  You were excited.  You wanted this.  So excited.  The day before, I was on this very program saying, I can't wait until 9 o'clock when the 
[00:08:00]  store opens.  And sent an intern out that second with money to get it.  And when I went home that night to load it up, nothing but problems with compatibility  with my computer.  And I've read so many comments about what a tool I am, how I don't know about computers,  how my computer must be a piece of crap because he doesn't know.  I almost want to make a follow-up video that shows my computer because I didn't know this  thing would kind of take off like it did. 
[00:08:30]  But it's gotten a lot of hits and it's really being talked about on the tech site.  Can we explain that you loaded it into your shredder?  Yeah, what I did was I took Vista finally after five failed attempts to install it on  my computer and installed it in my shredder at home.  Successfully.  Yes, very successfully.  And it made quite the sound.  Yeah.  And people said, you know, what a waste of money.  The guy just doesn't know about computers.  His computer must be a piece of crap.  You can't install it on some old piece of garbage that you check your email on. 
[00:09:00]  Like, I got bashed.  I'm getting bashed by a lot of people.  But it's, you know, part of the thing.  I really don't care about that.  It's kind of funny because the fact of the matter is I know a lot about computers and  I have a really good computer.  That's what's fun about reading the comments because everyone that's associated with the  show knows that you're an Uber computer geek.  I will only get the best.  The best of the best and you really know the ins and outs of your computer.  So when people are leaving these comments because they don't know who you are, they 
[00:09:30]  don't know about the show, they just think you're a dummy, it makes me laugh.  That's the most fun I've had is reading the comments.  Guys that are so adamant about it too.  This guy is such a fanboy of Mac and he probably doesn't even own Windows.  It's like, yeah, that's why I bought a Vista program and tried to install it on my Mac.  That might have been the problem.  I was trying to install it on a Mac.  Oh, you're up for the partition?  No, no, no.  That's what they're thinking, I think.  Can you car crash by retardation? 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  I hate you.  It's trying to get more sound effects in.  Anyway, so yeah, that video is all over the place as well.  Close to 900,000 views on break.com.  Struck a nerve.  Another couple hundred thousand on YouTube.  It's just amazing.  That video just took off like it did.  I had a couple of people over last night and that's probably why I sound like this.  If you're thinking I might be sleepy, you're right. 
[00:10:30]  I didn't sleep much last night and I may have drank a little too much.  So for some reason I sound like this.  But I had to give everybody the tour of the house and then took them down in the basement where it just really – I realized how bad it looks to people.  When they walk down, see a giant green screen and like film lighting and tripods.  And I just said, I go, this is where I make my snuff films. 
[00:11:00]  It really looks awful.  A Girl Scout uniform just thrown in the corner of the basement.  This is where I make my pornography.  Oh, boy.  Well, the maid didn't clean up the basement.  It looks really bad, but I'm setting up.  I think I'm gearing up to make a few more videos.  Yeah.  I don't know what, but I think it will be fun.  I got – I told you the idea for my video.  Oh, yeah.  And I will do this video.  I need another opportunity, though.  It would have been a perfect Super Bowl video.  That's all I want to say right now. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, I know.  Because I don't want anyone to steal my idea.  I've never seen it done.  I guarantee it will get a million views.  No problem.  Absolutely.  By the way, if you get the feeling we don't really care about our radio show anymore  and we're all about being Internet video stars, you're right.  You're right.  Let's admit it right here.  That's it.  We just care about being on YouTube.  Yeah, this radio thing is just kind of a hobby at this point.  We want to be YouTube stars.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  How sad is that?  Like, I want to do a podcast.  I have this radio show, and we do it on a daily basis, and I think it reaches a few people.  I can't.  But for some reason, I just want to do a video podcast.  I can't wait for the day that we blow up our careers for good.  Again, yeah.  And next time, it will be a doozy.  And then you just go back to doing radio or podcasts where you don't have to listen to anybody.  That's it.  You just do whatever the hell you want.  Imagine you get, like, you do your podcast or your video podcast or something. 
[00:12:30]  You get online.  You get on YouTube.  It's funny.  It's getting a lot of hits, and you get a phone call.  Yeah, I'm thinking what you ought to do is move the lighting a little bit because it's not quite right.  Wait, who is this?  I'm the PD of YouTube.  See, most people don't know about this, but there's bosses here, mister.  And you have to pay attention to me.  Yeah.  But I thought this was just kind of a free thing that people did and had fun. 
[00:13:00]  No, you have a boss in this, too.  Yeah.  What?  But I was just having fun.  By the way, Ann, I got to say it.  I'm a little hurt.  Why?  And maybe Jimmy's a little hurt, too.  I noticed the same thing.  Yeah, thank you.  Oh, no.  Thank you.  That was the tour.  He's inviting listeners over to his fine new house before he invites his pals.  Let me tell you something.  And I know you had some of your pals over yesterday.  I did.  I never thought I would hear that listeners are invited to your house before I.  I will tell you both.  You, too, can come over whenever you want. 
[00:13:30]  See?  If it's 11 o'clock at night.  You know what that's like?  When someone tells you awful news, you go, hey, man, I'm there for you.  Whatever you need.  Whatever you need.  Whatever you need.  But here's another part of it.  That whole whatever you need crap is just that crap.  I don't want to be insulting, but it was also a poker game.  And you two have done nothing.  Nothing.  But talk about how much you hate the game of poker.  And, Jimmy, forget it. 
[00:14:00]  You don't even understand it.  You blurt out things that make no sense.  I actually played poker.  Yeah.  Listen to Jimmy.  He knows poker.  Jimmy, show him the knowledge you got.  You throw me a couple of pairs, and if my river card matches one of those pairs,  it looks like someone got a full house.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  See?  See, this is why I didn't want him there.  What?  You'd embarrass me.  He would make your game very exciting.  Very exciting?  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Freddie in Belmore.  Freddie.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  What's up, Freddie? 
[00:14:30]  You guys always talking about Howard.  Howard does that waxing every damn day.  Does he?  Does he?  If no one hears Howard doing waxing every damn day, is he really doing it?  Is he really doing it?  You're not trying to say that we're ripping off a waxing bit, are you?  That's what I'm trying to say, boy.  Oh, you're just a dope, Freddie.  So, he invented waxing?  You see it all the time on it.  You hear it?  I would say...  Wait, wait.  He invented waxing, people? 
[00:15:00]  I would say as far as the latest waxing craze, because people have been waxed on radio for  many, many years.  But the latest waxing craze probably came because of that movie, 40-Year-Old Virgin.  40-Year-Old Virgin.  That was huge.  They waxed his chest, and it was bleeding, and it was actually done.  Right.  As they filmed it, it was his honest reaction and bleeding and stuff.  But you insist that that's Howie's, huh?  And why are you listening to us today, Freddie?  Yeah.  I like you guys.  All right. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, well, thank you.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Freddie's just trying to get on the radio.  I just got a text from my sister, Dawn, and she goes, I know how Opie and Jimmy feel.  Oh, wasn't Dawn there either?  No, my sister has never...  No, he does it to his own family, too.  My sister has never been to my house.  Maybe we should have a party.  Me, you, we could call Sal, his mom, and maybe Dawn, and all the five of us just go out  to dinner with a picture of him.  We'll just put a picture of him and talk to it.  Hey, could you call my phone real fast, too?  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:16:00]  I thought you were going to give out your own number.  Oh, no, no.  I finally changed my phone ring.  I heard it for the first time on the elevator on the way down from the station yesterday.  There it is.  And I felt happy.  Who wouldn't just laugh hearing this on a ringer?  I'm obsessed with this Drew Boogie song.  Who isn't?  Dude, how do you get that?  I'm obsessed.  I'm not telling you. 
[00:16:30]  They tried to do it on my phone.  I can't do it.  You can't get a ringtone on your phone?  I don't know how to do online stuff.  Oh, Jimmy.  I think that ringtone's up on opianthony.com as well?  Yeah.  All right.  See, very aggressive with the internet.  If you're becoming a fan of this radio show, you've got to make sure you stop at opianthony.com  on a daily basis.  So there you go.  That replaces...  I got kiddie porn on my computer.  Maybe in spirit, but not in spirit.  I couldn't take it anymore.  Jimmy yelling that 80 times.  It was really embarrassing at meetings and stuff when opi's phone would ring, and it 
[00:17:00]  would just yell out, I have kiddie porn on my computer.  Well, now I think if you send me a text, it's E-Rock screaming from getting waxed.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  That's a good one, too.  Oh, Jimmy is getting pissed off.  Danny spent an hour yesterday trying to figure it out.  No, it's not his fault.  I need software or something.  He probably is going to send you pictures of him holding the phone in precarious places  on his body now.  He gave it to him.  Send him back pictures of him leaving the phone.  It should take two seconds to do, but Jimmy seems to be the only person who has a Blackberry 
[00:17:30]  with no email or web access.  How do I do that?  You just call Verizon.  Have him add it to your plan.  Verizon.  All right.  There you go.  Sorry, Jimmy.  You got the E thing?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk about the E thing next.  Ecstasy, we're all popping.  Nice.  Okay.  It's either E or X, whatever you want to call it.  Some buttery beets for everybody this morning.  Buttery beets.  I got some glow sticks.  Oh, here it is.  We can rave.  All right, cool.  It's right in front of us.  The Tyra Banks thing just blew up. 
[00:18:00]  Like, per se.  Blew up.  We made the Daily Ten on E last night, and another huge laugh for me.  Another huge laugh for me.  And they started something with E, by the way.  We'll get into this whole thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But it's not good enough to be an O&A pest anymore.  You have to be part of a...  Part of a...  A faction.  A faction.  Thank you.  There are different factions now.  Yeah.  They've branched off.  They have certainly branched off with the same goal in mind.  I like sequels.  It's like Happy Days, and then Joanie Loves Chachi. 
[00:18:30]  It's more like Iraq.  Yeah.  Laughing each other's heads off with any luck.  Or the old Soviet Union.  They're all just breaking off into...  Right, divvying up.  But they still like this old Soviet Union somehow.  Trying to run themselves, but there's still a common link.  All right.  We'll get into the fine mention we got last night on the Daily Ten on E and other things.  Nice.  It is the Opie and Anthony Show, starring Lil Jimmy Norton.

We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, by the way, it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Oh, it is.  It's the dead of winter for most of our cities.  I know we're on in Vegas and West Palm Beach and Dallas.  But as we get closer to spring, man, we're going to pop this wow big time. 
[00:21:00]  Big time.  You're going to find out the power of wow.  The power.  There are women out there every single day because basically it's Whip'em Out Whenever.  But this cute little thing started on Wednesday, so it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  You put a wow sticker or a wow sign or write it in the dirt in the back of your truck or car, and that's a sign for the ladies out there.  Yeah, they see it and they flash you.  It's easy.  It's nice.  It's something that makes the commute a little easier. 
[00:21:30]  Sitting in traffic and all of a sudden you look over and there's a girl just flashing you.  And you go, why is she doing that?  Oh, that's right.  I put a wow sticker on my car.  And I hope the radio stations we're on are giving out the wow stickers like crazy.  I hope they're that smart.  I hope.  Don't be stupid.  We brought bumper stickers back to cars.  The bumpers.  Someone actually told us that back in the day.  They said, hey, man, before the wow stickers, people gave up on actually putting a bumper sticker on their car. 
[00:22:00]  Bumper sticker.  They didn't want anything on their brand new cars or whatever.  But they want the wow stickers because they know the women are out there and they will flash you.  I always put some funny bumper stickers on like I have.  Do you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're driving, pull over.  I have one that says, my kid beat up your honor, student.  You know, we just laugh when people see that.  I just look in the rear view mirror and I see the smiles I'm putting on their faces.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I like the ones that, um, I don't even know what to say. 
[00:22:30]  I like the fact that the music came down.  Oh, yeah.  A little dead silence.  As it should have.  Well, we were having a party, but everyone just go home.  We ran out of beer here.  No.  See the ones that say, ask me about my grandchildren.  I never saw that one.  You've never seen that one?  No.  It's just the old people drive around.  It's ask me about my grandchildren.  You should pull over that car and ask about your grandchildren. 
[00:23:00]  Slap one of those on the Benet families, Grant.  Well, Ms. Dahmer, can you explain?  Yeah.  They just want you to ask.  They're so old, no one talks to them.  It could be just ask me about my lunch, ask me about my stroke, anything.  They just want to talk to somebody.  I found Jesus and he's in my trunk.  Oh, that's a good one.  All right.  Hey, let's say hi to Bill in Jersey.  What's up, Bill?  You're on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bill?  Hey, I just wanted to thank Anthony for having me over last night.  That was one hell of a party, man. 
[00:23:30]  Son of a...  I'm just glad I saw the announcement on justanthony.com or else I probably would have missed it.  You weren't at my house, you liar.  Yeah, but listeners were at your house.  How many people?  Hey, those strippers were hot, man.  One, two, three, four, five.  So, anyway, touch it out.  Thanks, Dan.  Love you.  All right.  Well, thanks.  Great.  Great.  Eight, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  You could have watched it on Pal Talk.  Nah, that would have been nice. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Cool.  I just ride out to Long Island, have some dinner with some friends, maybe, go to play some  poker, but nah.  Yeah.  No big deal.  I've probably passed Anthony's exit a hundred times since he's got his house.  I know.  And just turn.  And he's barely off the expressway, too.  It'd just be a quick little, hey, what's up?  Come on over.  But now listeners are going to his house before we are.  But you can come over any time.  It's not like a party invitation.  That's like, it wasn't a party.  It was a poker game.  You're invited any time is just babble. 
[00:24:30]  It really is.  No one's going to take you up.  It was a poker game.  I learned that when my dad passed and, you know, going through the whole process.  People are like, hey, man, whatever you need, whatever you need.  But if you want to come over, come over today.  See, instead of saying stuff like that to people, whatever you need, do something.  Do something about it.  Be not, you know, do something unexpected.  My girlfriend had somebody pass away recently that she, you know, it was somebody in somebody's 
[00:25:00]  family.  So she wrote a nice little email to the guy, a sincere email.  But I wanted to punch her because she signed it.  She wrote, if you need anything, be it food or labor.  Be it.  Food or.  First of all, be it is awful.  And then food or labor.  I let her send it and then I attacked her.  Oh, good for you.  She's like, why did you tell me?  I'm like, it was awful.  Be it food or labor.  That's like, that's like digging the hole on Boot Hill. 
[00:25:30]  They'd be it food or labor.  Yeah.  You don't really mean it when you say stuff like that.  Like, like the other day, uh, my girlfriend, uh, you know, came home a little later from  school.  I have to say those words.  From school.  And, uh, you know, she was hungry and it's like 10 degrees out.  We have nothing in the house right now.  And I'm like, if you want, I'll go get you something.  If you want.  If you really want me to, I'll go get you something.  You know, I'm all in like PJs and stuff ready to crash. 
[00:26:00]  You know, but see, the right thing to do is to just get up and do it.  Just do it.  Because especially girlfriends and wives and stuff will go, no, that's okay.  That's okay.  But they really do want you to step up and get them some lousy food, you know?  Some lousy food.  Get her some chow.  Get them.  Yeah.  Get them some chow.  Speaking of girlfriends, Jimmy.  Chow or lousy food.  Be it food or labor.  I told her, if you ever write a thing like that, I'm going to break your computer without  having me. 
[00:26:30]  We were going to talk about the Tyra Banks thing that really blew up yesterday nicely  for the Opie and Anthony show.  But we go to break and Jimmy goes, hey, what was the exact quote?  I don't want to misquote you.  It was something about, I think I just asked Ann, is your girlfriend like PMS?  I mean, I know every comic talk, is she insane?  I forgot what it's like to deal with this.  And I just came to the conclusion that Jimmy has never been with a girl long enough that  she's gone through one cycle.  I've never made it past 26 days.  You know, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  As soon as I hear I'm on my, it's click.  Why do you think guys have hobbies?  That's the only reason.  I want to go to Mantown.  That's the only reason you join a dart league or go shoot a few racks of pool.  I forgot.  You figure out what your hobbies are, man.  Every girl has their own little way of dealing with it.  Are you learning some new things about your girlfriend?  I'm apparently dating an astronaut.  She's a psychopath.  She's putting on a diaper and driving. 
[00:27:30]  She starts this weird discussion about something like, you know, what kind of place in a relationship  do you think jealousy has?  Like, this open-ended thing.  I'm like, I don't know.  And we just start talking about it.  She's like, she just wants us to have a relationship.  We trust each other.  We're not jealous.  But then it goes into these places.  I'm like, what are you trying to say?  I'm trying to be specific.  You know what it is?  Oh, no.  It's the questions that don't have an answer.  Yes.  But you have to answer.  Uh.  Uh. 
[00:28:00]  The old, the guy at the bridge question.  There's no right answer.  You got to cross the bridge.  There's no real right answer.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a tough nut.  We should get into that.  The questions that have no right answer.  That is really something.  If you, if you, um, if you become, uh, infatuated and, and like fall head over heels with a girl and it's a whole month before her time, you kind of realize what, what you're getting into at that point. 
[00:28:30]  And you're like, oh, boy, what, what happened?  I, I, I went, I had a girlfriend that, um, she would, it wasn't so much mental as just physical.  She would be in pain like, like the scene in Reservoir Dogs.  She should be in the back of a car just going, ah, you're going to be okay.  I'm going to die over here.  I'm dying.  It, it just was, she would double over in pain every month, crying hysterically, grabbing her, her gut and just in pain. 
[00:29:00]  And I'm like, okay, I, I got to deal with this every month.  Lucky you.  I'd take that over the open ended question any day.  I wish my girlfriend was suffering right now, curled up on the floor.  I just pat her head and go, it's going to be all right, psycho.  So how, how do you get out of it?  We argued a little bit.  And then I'm like.  What was your answer to the jealousy question? 
[00:29:30]  Well, it wasn't a bad question.  She was like, I'm saying like, where, where, where does jealousy replace the relationship?  Like, I'm like, I don't know.  I mean, she's like, I want us to both be kind of free.  And like, she's like, we're both sexual beings.  I want us to trust each other.  And like, she's like, if I go to, she's like, if you ever pick me up at a party, say for first, first of all, I didn't like that example.  Like, why am I picking you up at the party?  Like a cuckold.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I think she like, she wants me just to trust that she was faithful and this and that and not question her and all that stuff.  Right.  And it's just getting to this weird area. 
[00:30:00]  I'm like, what do you want?  Do you want to go and flirt?  And she's like, no.  And no matter what I said, she would say no.  Oh, you, you, so, but you saw that conversation as going to this place where she's kind of saying maybe she wants a little freedom to go out and, and prove that she's still got it.  In a way, yeah.  Because you've been together for what?  How long?  Two months.  That might come after, you know, 10 years.  Well, I said to her, like, what don't we have now?  You're free to do what you want.  I don't tell you what to do.  You always go out.  I'm on the road.  You're always out.  Like, I don't ask you what to do. 
[00:30:30]  It was just, it wasn't rational.  None of it was rational.  It was lunacy.  Yeah.  And then she starts yelling at me in the bed, sitting there.  Oh, no.  And I just felt it.  I'm like, I'm going to, I'm going to turn over and just try to take a nap or I'm going to throw my dresser at her.  You can't turn over and try to take a nap.  That's the worst thing you could do.  Give it three days.  She'll apologize for everything.  No, no, no.  She did already.  Oh, okay.  She's like, we talked.  You know what the problem is here in New York?  And it's happening to, you know, a lot of the cities we're broadcasting in right now.  We're shut-ins. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  We've got to get out of our houses.  There's too much conversation going on.  Dangerous conversation.  You've got to.  It's the lifestyle we lead.  Huh?  It's the lifestyle we lead.  Well, that's the problem with living in New York City.  When it gets this cold, you just become a shut-in.  There's no reason to leave your apartment.  That, the hours we keep, makes it difficult to get out and do things.  Yeah.  Well, good luck to you on that, Joe.  Kind of cooped up.  I just don't know what she wants.  Why are you doing this?  She was asking you questions.  You should have answered them.  She admitted she was PMSing. 
[00:31:30]  She's like, it's really bad this month.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, she knew it, so.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob in Providence, Rhode Island.  Bob, what's up?  Bob.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, love the show.  Love Jim Norton.  Thanks, man.  Hey, for those questions they ask that you can't answer, it's how many women you've loved  before them.  Yeah, we've got to get into this a little bit.  I think we're on to something.  The questions that have no right answer.  And you're asked these questions as a guy, and you sit there like, oh, God.  What do I say?  What do I say? 
[00:32:00]  I've been around for 10 years.  She asks me questions like that every day.  Don't admit to more than six.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Pat in New Jersey.  Pat, what's going on?  Hi, Pat.  Pat.  For the old-timers.  Yeah.  Hey, Pat.  What's happening?  What's up?  Not much, guys.  Hey, I get one question once a month.  Why don't I have any friends?  I don't know.  Maybe because you're a complete psycho.  Yeah.  Oh, she doesn't have friends. 
[00:32:30]  So how do you answer that question?  It's a different answer sometimes.  You got friends.  You got friends.  Come on.  You got friends.  But the bitch word comes up a lot, too.  It's just an irrational thing.  I mean, she goes out.  She has friends.  I mean, we spend a lot of time together.  But, I mean, I'm gone every weekend.  She's very active.  She has a very busy life.  Yeah.  It doesn't require me for her to exist.  It doesn't require you.  Do you know what I'm saying?  It's not that type of codependence thing at all.  She's got her own thing going completely.  But it's just...  I'm the one who's probably more like... 
[00:33:00]  How often do you stay in touch over the phone or things like that when you guys are away from each other?  We text a lot, constantly.  Yeah.  I like it, though.  I never did that.  I never did that.  No.  Ever.  Jimmy's in love.  Oh, yeah.  We all see it.  We've seen it before.  I told her one of the things...  Nice.  I would always get women to leave immediately.  Like, I'd like her to stay over at my house.  But I would always say when women wanted to come over, like, you got to go after.  Like, I don't want anyone to stay in my place.  I don't like people in my space.  But I'll actually leave and leave her in my apartment.  Unheard of.  Wow.  Unheard of. 
[00:33:30]  That is.  You must have hired CSI.  You must have hired CSI.  Are you insane?  Believe me, I know that that's an error in judgment.  Oh, my God.  How long did it take for you to be confident enough to do that?  I have a storage unit downstairs.  Okay.  It's like 40 trips.  There it is.  Because, dude, I'm just your friend.  And I remember back in the day, I would be, like, around the corner.  Hey, Jim, I just happened to be in the area.  I'm going to stop in and say hi. 
[00:34:00]  Ah.  No.  Could you give me, like, a half hour?  He just wants to...  And I know what he's doing.  He's just combing the place.  Yeah.  You know, I don't think he's doing anything at that particular moment.  But he just needs time to kind of look around and make sure everything's all right.  And then you go over Jimmy's.  You start walking around a little bit.  He gets very nervous.  Well, Frank, it's safe to come over.  He's got four different computers.  That's just awful.  Oof. 
[00:34:30]  Is there a roll of paper towels by one?  There's a little toilet paper dispenser by every one.  And she wanted to, like, she had to check her email, so I just bought her her own Mac.  To check her email.  Yeah, baby.  There you go.  No, you don't want to use my mind.  You're so nice, well, you know.  Oh, my mind is just...  It's slowed down now.  There must be viruses or something.  Just...  Here's a brand new computer.  Please don't touch mine. 
[00:35:00]  I'm telling you, man.  You had to have hired CSI.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave, what's up?  Dave.  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Dave?  Hey.  I was going to tell him that before, the question with number one no answer is, what are you thinking?  The what are you thinking question, huh?  Uh-huh.  I've gotten that one.  That's kind of like one of those hack comic ones.  Yeah, I don't get that.  What are you thinking?  It's like, no, girls pretty much don't ask that. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  It's more...  But they will ask, like, what do you think of this?  Like, outfit.  Like, they put something on, and they go, what do you think of this?  That's a perfect one.  And that's one of those where you go, yeah, it looks really good.  There's no right answer to, you know, you can't really say, eh.  I do that, though, sometimes, because I just don't like the way it looks or something.  And you just go, eh.  I don't know.  Eh.  But then it leads to other things sometimes. 
[00:36:00]  You see things that look better, like, on you.  Well, what do you mean?  Does my ass look fat in this?  No, no, it's just I've seen other things that I like that I think, personally, my opinion,  you look better in.  Yeah, I'm better in.  And it's, you know, it's just my opinion, but you called me fat.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've seen things, clothing, that you have worn in the past that looks better than what  you have on right now. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, well, what's wrong with it?  What do you like about the other thing that you don't like about this?  Um, my brain?  I don't like my brain.  It's a stupid brain.  She put an outfit on one day.  It was, like, a long, kind of, like, a dress that she looked good in.  But under it, because it was cold.  She had, like, a shirt and, like, leggings to be cold out.  And she's like, what do you think?  I'm like, you look like an art student.  Oh, no.  I don't like that.  Look, I love you in that, but not with the things under it. 
[00:37:00]  You just rule with an iron fist like that.  Yeah, and it was an error in judgment.  Was it?  It's been spit back in my face.  Well, you said I look like an art student, you know.  Right.  I got so offended one time when she told me that the shirt I was wearing with my suit  kind of made me just, she's like, I don't know, it kind of looks like trashy in Jersey.  Wow, you two are a pip.  Oh, it's great.  By the way, the...  I smell reality show.  Yeah, the questions that have no answers, that has everything to do with PMS.  That's why we're going down this road.  I think you're right. 
[00:37:30]  Scott in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got the question, the number one question probably from my wife.  If I had to choose between her and my mother, who would I save in case of emergency?  Really?  I never got that.  See, that's just PMS stuff.  That's easy, though, because it's hypothetical.  So it doesn't have to be a real answer because it's not a real question.  So you always default to saving her so you don't get into an argument.  But then you say you're going to save her, and then that leads to something like, you  don't mean that, and it's just like, oh, why don't we just watch The Office? 
[00:38:00]  It's on DVR.  I just tell her that.  We're all just going to die together.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Walt in Jersey.  Walt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Hey, Walt.  Walt, I got a question that a lot of my friends get answered, get questioned.  What friends would you bang of mine?  Yeah, well, that's another one that you kind of hear comics use. 
[00:38:30]  But what friends?  Why would a girl ask you that?  And then you got to come up with a friend's name?  They're probably jealous of her friends, you know, thinking, like, the other friend is  hotter than her, and you always stare at her.  Here's how you get out of that.  You just pick a guy that she knows and name him.  No, I think the wife or the girlfriend...  Diffuses it immediately.  I think that the wife or the girlfriend asking if her friends are hot is a very popular question  that doesn't have an answer, an answer that's going to be pleasant for everyone involved. 
[00:39:00]  She got mad because I was sending her texts about her grandmother, just like things that  I would do.  Oh, no, you're pulling that gag.  In text?  I swear to God, I'm like, do you think your grandmother's a size queen?  She's like, stop.  Enough.  Because then she pictures her grandmother doing awful things that you're texting.  And I said, do you think your grandmother...  I just said it like this, and it wasn't about...  I'm not going to say what it was about, but I said, do you think grandma grunts when a  big boy hits bottom? 
[00:39:30]  She pictures this in her head.  You're painting a picture, you ass.  Well, Negro.  Javier, Philly, listening on WISP.  What's up, buddy?  Good morning, O.W.D.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing all right, bro.  Well, my wife, she has a lot of hot friends, and she always asks me, well, do you think  she's hot?  And if I say yes, I'm a jerk.  But if I say no, she'll know I'm lying because she knows the kind of girls I'm into.  Yeah.  So I'm stuck. 
[00:40:00]  And you sit there like, why are you asking this question?  Here's how you deal with that.  You know, you guys, you head those off at the pass.  Here's what you do.  If you've got a girlfriend or a wife and she has a couple of or one attractive friend, you  comment on it before it ever comes up.  Under the guise that someone you know has commented that way.  Like, hey, you know, my buddy Bill really thinks your friend, blah, blah, blah, is attractive. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  And, you know, I guess she is, you know.  Never really noticed.  But, yeah, he's brought up the fact that kind of attractive girl.  Good acting.  Yeah.  Horrible acting.  They see right through it.  His voice, when you hear Anthony's voice, you're like, yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It goes up.  Yeah.  I really like to tool her.  Let's go to Jesse in Massachusetts. 
[00:41:00]  Jesse.  Hi.  The most ridiculous question I ever got.  We were watching Dawn of the Dead.  And my girlfriend turns to me and goes, hey, if I ever turned into a zombie, would you be able to shoot me in the head?  That's a great question.  How do you answer that?  You don't want to be eaten by a zombie, but it's your chick.  You say that it's you.  I would miss you and stuff.  Yeah.  But I really don't want to be a zombie.  How about this?  If you say I'm actually rooting for you to turn into one so I can. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, that's a good one, Jesse.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Zombie.  Let's go to David in Boston.  David.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good.  My question is, like, if a girl asks you what your sexual fantasies are, but then her follow-up question to that is, so how many of your girlfriends have you done that with before me?  So she asks you your fantasy.  You tell her.  You're brave enough to say, well, my fantasy is whatever.  And then she asks you, have you done that before? 
[00:42:00]  I think it's the only answer you can give.  Like, the safest answer is, well, none of my girlfriends.  I just watch a lot of German porn.  All right.  Thank you, David.  Let's go to Chris in Philly.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Try to keep it clean for the radio.  You got a rough one here.  You'd never tell him you had the old back door with anyone else.  Okay.  She asked you that?  Hello? 
[00:42:30]  He's punching out.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Yeah, she asked him?  I don't know.  Or he just volunteered that info.  All right, we're on to something here.  We'll continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wild!  To get your official Opie and Anthony wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus. 
[00:43:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  Infected.  Coming this weekend to the Saturday Night Virus, it's the return of Uninformed with Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa.  Close the door, Steve.  That's this Saturday, February 10th from 9 to midnight on XM 202.  The virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:43:30]  Getting right back into it.  A lot of snow in Syracuse, I see, huh?  Oh, yeah.  What's up, Syracuse?  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Look at the pictures they're showing on Good Morning America.  That's Syracuse.  Look at all that snow.  I know Buffalo got hit hard, too.  I got to go to Albany.  You know what I'm doing?  We're a bunch of wimps here in New York City.  We're bitching because it's, what, 15 degrees today?  Yeah.  It's colder in these other cities, plus they got just stupid amounts of snow. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, but we don't have to like it.  It's cold.  It's cold everywhere.  All right.  A couple things going on.  I also was taking a peek at the TV there.  What's up with this eternal embrace?  It's the eternal embrace.  It's the big kind of a human interest story.  Human remains interest story.  They unearthed some human skeletons in Italy.  Italy, I believe. 
[00:44:30]  And they're calling it a 5,000-year embrace.  There's a skeleton, skeletons of two people, and apparently they're locked in a hug, sort of, with their legs bent, and they're hugging each other, and their faces are very close together.  And they're saying that they've been hugging each other like this in death for over 5,000 years.  And all I can think of is someone just decided to screw the whole thing up. 
[00:45:00]  It's been 5,000 years.  Just, if they're in this embrace, let them remain hugging.  But some idiot with a plow has to just dig them up.  He's got to just be the bit set.  It's like, oh, 5,042 years, and now it's over.  Just imagine the morning breath.  Oh, that would be pretty bad.  Because they're facing each other.  They're facing each other for 5,000 years in death. 
[00:45:30]  With those jaw bones that have dropped.  And that horrific Nazi from Raiders of the Lost Ark way, where his mouth just went.  Their jaws just drop, and they're laying there.  I like how people speculate, though, just because they see them kind of laying there next to each other.  Yeah.  In what seems to be an embrace.  Maybe it was an embrace.  Maybe it wasn't.  Maybe they hated each other. 
[00:46:00]  Jimmy brought up a good point.  What did he say?  What the hell did you say about them two?  That it looked like the one guy was grabbing the shoulders of another guy, demanding his money back.  It was like probably some type of a vicious argument that they got caught in a sunspot.  That would be great.  A sunspot.  Killed them both in the spot.  That would be great if we look at it all romantically,  and it turned out it's just two guys yelling at each other.  One guy killed the other one, stabbed him, and he bent over. 
[00:46:30]  And then the other guy was grabbing him to bring him to the ground after he stabbed him.  Yeah.  And with his last dying breath, the other guy pulled out his shank made out of bone and stabbed him.  And they just laid there after killing each other.  It looks like he's being grabbed by the shoulders.  Yeah.  You touch my daughter again, I'll kill you.  Why you?  You know marrying age is nine.  That was, you know, ancient times.  And you know that they're looking at heaven going, but we're not homosexuals.  Stuck in a 5,000-year homo embrace. 
[00:47:00]  He was tying his shoes.  His friend was walking up reading, didn't see him.  Something happened.  We've got to finish up this topic, and then we're going to move on.  John, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  I went on a trip last year with a bunch of my friends.  My girlfriend didn't come with me.  And when I got back, she asked me if I'd hooked up with anybody on the trip.  And I said, of course not.  And she said, well, you could have.  Uh-oh. 
[00:47:30]  That means trouble.  It means she did.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I mean, there's two questions.  Yeah, what happened while I was gone?  And the other thing is, you know, the time to tell me that was before I left.  Well, she said you could have.  Did that mean that she had?  What finally happened?  I don't know.  I mean, that's what I asked her.  I just said, you know, so what happened while I was gone?  And she got real different.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's not what I meant.  That's not what I meant.  Yeah, sometimes they try to.  Women are not good psychologists.  They're really dopes.  They try to throw out things like, you know, like, yeah, it's okay if you do it.  Like, you know, just to see if you did do it or if you do it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah.  It's always a game plan, right?  I've been lying to people for 20 years.  Stop it.  Don't even try.  Let's go all the way up to Toronto.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Andrew.  Love the show up here.  Thank you, sir.  Just wanted to warn Jimmy.  I get the questions that you get, but my girl text messages them to me.  Are they all caps?  Just angry, yelling caps.  Huh?  Yeah, because you can't respond to that because she can't read any inflection in your voice. 
[00:48:30]  So it's absolutely horrible.  Yeah, when you write out stuff, it's very dangerous because you don't know the way it was meant.  That's why you don't get into serious conversations in a text.  You kind of just, it's all, you know, yes, be right there.  Yeah.  Uh, see you later.  You have IM conversations, and it's like, no, I didn't mean it like that.  But that's what you said.  It's like, yeah, but if I said it to you in person, you would understand what I was trying  to say here.  You've got to write it like a book. 
[00:49:00]  But in the year 2007, you would figure that we would have to make it.  And it's even worse because I get them when I'm at work, so I've got to respond to it  and then go teach 30 children.  All right.  Thank you, Andrew.  I, I, I, I'm distracted because the, the, the, the eternal embrace, the eternal embrace  Jim has something.  Jim?  The guy, Anthony, I heard they were yelling, two damage, two damage.  That was a long time ago.  Two damage, two damage.  Well, now people are taking a look at the picture online, and now they got their own 
[00:49:30]  comments, so give us a call.  All right.  And also, um, there's a, there's an update on the astronaut.  This story is great.  Astronaut, Hopi.  You got to be funny like the newspapers and call her an astronaut.  Astronaut.  So she's a little crazy.  Uh, well, they're calling her the diaper astronaut as well.  Yeah.  Fox News put the diaper astronaut, uh, dark side of the loon.  Yeah.  Is another, uh, paper headline.  Wow.  Dark side of the loon. 
[00:50:00]  How would you like to be her?  Lost in space?  No, lost in space.  Oh, lost in space.  You know, we got to play around with the headline today.  Let's see what the other papers, what are the other papers using as the headline for  this, uh, loony?  Our, uh, our correspondent, Jim Norton, is on top of this one.  Jimmy?  Oh.  Yeah, she's in trouble.  She's a, she's a, she's a dirty girl.  Oh, she's naughty.  She was, I think she was hooking up with this astronaut.  Um, I don't know if she was sleeping with him, but I think she was in love with him  and he's dating some 30 year old sexy chick. 
[00:50:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh, and, uh, she drove to, uh, three, four or five states to kill her.  That's pretty much it.  That's it.  I can't believe she was going to kill her, but it seems like she, she had garbage bags  and a mallet.  What a mallet.  Which was Tom and Jerry style.  Yeah, but what.  She's going to kill her.  What else do you do with garbage bags and a mallet?  And a mallet?  Yeah.  Wearing a diaper so she, uh, didn't have to, uh, make any stops.  That's the best part of the story.  Why wouldn't you just stop and take a break from the ride?  She was on the shuttle.  That's what they do.  They, they, you know, wear a little diety, I guess. 
[00:51:00]  And, uh, she was using her space experience.  Don't you, don't you need to stop just to kind of stretch your legs and, uh.  But I guess when you're murdering someone, all that goes out the window.  Yeah.  You want to get there as, uh, fast as possible.  Got to get there fast and put a mallet over her head.  She must have been, look, she must have been racing the clock.  Like, she must have been figuring what time the plane landed and said, look, if I race,  I can get there an hour before it lands.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  It's.  Wait, what's it not?  A clocker with a mallet?  Why, why a plane landing?  Oh, the girl.  I'm not on this story as, as, as much as I should be. 
[00:51:30]  The girl, Colleen Shipman, that she was going to allegedly kill was, uh, flying from Houston  to Orlando.  So she drove from Houston to Orlando.  I guess there should be no record of her flying there with diapers and, uh, you know, a mallet  and, uh.  Oh, and that's another reason why she didn't want to stop.  So no one would see her at a rest area.  That's another thing.  Yeah.  Good idea.  Well, see, she was thinking this out.  But she's married.  Her and her split a few weeks ago, but she's been obsessed with this guy for months.  She's got a teenage kid.  Imagine your mother pulling that nonsense.  After being so proud of her as a, uh, uh, an astronaut. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  I mean, how many moms are astronauts?  Oh.  Thank God.  Astronauts.  You gotta see that on that.  Astronauts.  Dark side of the loon.  Yeah, that's that.  That's one of my favorites today.  We like to put out the challenge because this is the fun about, this is the fun as far  as, uh, doing a show for, uh, most of the country.  Beat this headline.  Yeah.  America.  Uh, Daily News.  Dark side of the loon.  Beat that today.  Because she's crazy. 
[00:52:30]  Uh.  I get it.  Uh, don't you stop for gas anyway?  It's a 900 mile drive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She would, she would see somebody because she's got to stop for gas.  She got a wig and a stupid, like a hoodie sweatshirt.  Yeah.  She knocks on the girl's, she reached her at the airport and she's getting into her car,  I guess.  And so she knocks on the window and says, can you help me?  And the girl didn't trust her.  So the girl wouldn't open her door.  And then she cracked her window finally.  And then, uh, the lady pepper sprayed her.  This, uh, the, not the astronauts pepper sprayed the other girl. 
[00:53:00]  Ooh.  And then she drove away.  And then got help.  I guess it didn't work very well.  Yeah.  Good thing she wasn't, uh.  Good plan.  That wasn't, it's old pepper spray.  Good thing she wasn't being raped.  Apparently just fueled someone to drive away.  Cut it out.  Hey, stop that, you.  And she was in space.  She was on a space shuttle, uh, mission.  What?  Yeah.  A year ago or something they're saying?  Yeah.  One of the last ones, right?  Operated the arm.  Operated the arm.  Yeah.  A robotic arm.  All right.  Hey, we made the news yesterday as well.  Yes, we did.  We got to get into the Tyra thing. 
[00:53:30]  Over our Tyra thing.  I was very, very excited to see, uh, see the Tyra thing blow up like it did yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  All the gossip, uh, websites, uh, took it and ran with it.  We were chatting about it.  And then, um, E! made it part of their Daily Ten last night.  Daily Ten is their, um, little rundown of the, the daily events.  Yeah.  And celebrity.  And I went from being very excited to very sad.  Uh, yeah.  I saw that and you're, you're implicated. 
[00:54:00]  No one was more surprised than I.  I was really surprised.  You are.  I said, what?  Totally implicated in this.  I said, what?  So, uh, for the people maybe that haven't been listening the last, uh, the last couple  of days, what's the Tyra Banks thing all about, Anthony?  Well, uh, yeah, you've seen it on our show, um, on the entertainment programs.  The paparazzi had snapped a picture of her, uh, in a, uh, bathing suit, some old woman  one-piece bathing suit.  And she wasn't, uh, quite as skinny as we recall. 
[00:54:30]  Big fat ass.  So, she got on a talk show because, uh, the paparazzi and people were giving her crap  about it.  So, she gets on a talk show and wears what she says was the same bathing suit.  And, obviously, uh, it was a smaller bathing suit.  And talks about how awful it is that she was being criticized for gaining weight.  She's not a model anymore.  She doesn't have to stick to that regimen.  Blah, blah, blah.  It was all about her.  Um, and, uh, she just finally told people.  I think you have the clip of what she finally told everybody that was giving her, uh, guff. 
[00:55:00]  Kiss my fat ass.  As she's crying, so, obviously, she cares.  Well.  Supposed to be like a, hey, I don't care, whatever you want to say.  Kiss my, uh, fat ass.  Kiss my fat ass.  But when you're weeping as you're saying it, it kind of takes away from the I don't  care, uh, attitude she was trying to put across.  And most people, uh, by now know that we have, uh, not only do we have fans and casual  listeners, we have pests. 
[00:55:30]  ONA pests.  They were just pests at the beginning.  Yeah, but now they're, uh, breaking off into all sorts of factions.  And, uh, and, uh, the pests out west.  The pests out west.  P.O.W.s, as they like to be called.  Jimmy pretty much, uh, went on the show.  We got the audio and said, look, you get some kind of sign that calls her fat on the  news.  She can see it.  On TV.  Maybe a sign she could actually see, whether it's, uh, where she broadcasts or maybe, 
[00:56:00]  uh, a very popular news program.  Yeah.  Jimmy will give $500.  What a generous guy.  And that, and that's all I remembered.  For the simple investment of a sign.  Right.  And a little courage.  Uh, somebody will make a hefty profit.  So the pests out west, very hard to say, but P.O.W., that's a, that's a fine, fine acronym.  Yep.  Uh, they got a professional sign made and they put it on the hedge right outside the CBS studios  in LA, where she, where she tapes her, her dumb TV show. 
[00:56:30]  The, uh, the Oprah wannabe TV show that she's doing for younger gals.  At the younger set.  And, uh, well, the websites picked up on it and the, the gossip columns and, and such.  And, uh, it just blew up yesterday.  And we made the daily 10 on E.  This is how it went down.  While Tyra Banks caught a fair bit of comedic ridicule on the back end of her now infamous  bathing suit episode of her daytime show, I really hope she doesn't subscribe to XM Radio. 
[00:57:00]  At number eight, Tyra's swimsuit clad on-air plea caught the attention of shock jock morning  DJs Opie and Anthony, who decided that Banks was ripe for their own brand of lowbrow public  humiliation.  I want her to see a sign that says Tyra is a self-centered fat pig.  Yeah, I'll pay $500.  Oh, $500.  It makes the news.  I got another 500.  No problem.  Oh boy. 
[00:57:30]  I went from really happy to really sad.  Oh boy.  I'm like, I said what?  Look what you said.  I was on this program yesterday morning saying, look, uh, poor Jimmy, he's gotta, he's gotta pay  up, but I did not say anything.  Look what you said now.  It's like, I said what?  So I will, uh, I will be paying $500 as well.  As well.  To Jewish Monkey, I believe, right?  I'm writing the check to Jewish Monkey, so good luck getting that into the bank.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I'll pay $500.  Oh.  $500.  It makes the news.  I got another 500.  No problem.  Pay up, boys.  After issuing that challenge to their listeners, one group of fans calling themselves the POWs  or Pess Out West went so far as to put up a giant banner out front of CBS's LA studio  where Tyra showed tapes and it read, Tyra Banks is a fatty pig fatty.  Very classy.  The insulting sign has since been taken down. 
[00:58:30]  No word yet on what Tyra has to say about this stuff.  I love when they have to do a story on this, just silliness.  And have to use those words.  Fatty pig fatty.  Fatty pig fatty.  With no explanation what that means as far as the show goes.  Just when you thought Fatty Pig Fatty was done, you know, we had used it for a contest  giving women a dollar a pound for what they weighed.  Yeah.  And, you know, it was pretty much done.  Fatty pig fatty contest. 
[00:59:00]  We weren't going to do it again or anything.  And just when you thought that was gone, there it is.  There it is.  On TV.  They got to explain.  They have to say it.  They got to say it.  I mean, yeah.  Fatty pig fatty indeed.  And you know someone told her that and she's thinking those words, fatty pig fatty.  No model.  What does that even mean?  I think that's worse than fatso.  Of course it is.  I've been called Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[00:59:30]  Just weeping on her show.  They must just think we're jerks.  Fatty pig fatty party.  They probably chuckle a little inside but go, wow, those guys are just jerks.  Well, you could tell by the way he was describing us.  He kind of likes us.  You can tell.  But no class and, you know.  You could tell he likes us.  Low brow.  Exactly.  He's got to play his part on TV.  Yeah, I understand.  You could tell by just how he's doing the story that he's chuckling inside. 
[01:00:00]  He thinks it's pretty funny.  A little chuckle.  So anyway, there you go.  The latest.  That's just great.  Yeah.  And it's been brought to my attention that the ONA pest, they're splitting up into all different types of groups under the umbrella of the ONA pest.  And is this true?  In the Northeast, they call themselves the Pines.  That stands for?  Pests in the Northern East States.  Pests in the South.  Pests in the South, they're called Pests in Southern States. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Figure out that acronym on your own.  Easy.  Then, of course, West, the most popular one at this point.  Pests out West.  In the Midwest, they call themselves the PMS.  Pests in Midwestern States.  Yeah, PMS.  And Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  Is this true?  Their acronym is rape.  What does that stand for?  Redneck A-hole Pest Empire. 
[01:01:00]  By the way, this is not us writing up a bit here.  No, they're actually calling themselves this.  Supposedly, some of these are legit organizations under the ONA pest umbrella.  Yeah.  Chicago, they just call themselves the Karen Meyer Fan Club.  It's a little rough.  And then others, POT, Pests of Texas, SCAT.  Uh, well, blank, caller, associated team.  All right, it just goes on and on.  Some of these are just dumb.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  They're very creative.  They're getting creative with their acronyms as far as ONA pest go.  And the different factions.  Yeah.  So, that video, by the way, is up on opianthony.com.  We got a bunch of videos that we added overnight.  The one, we started off the show with it.  I want to do it again here.  Uh, it's E-Rock, the E-Rock montage video.  We had a five-minute version up on YouTube and up on opianthony.com.  We now have a much shorter version.  It's about a minute and a half.  Top.  All the good parts. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it's up on opianthony.com.  It's up on YouTube.  We want this video to go viral.  We think it's hilarious.  E-Rock getting waxed.  Uh, here's, the audio, once again, is right here.  But the video, you can see on YouTube and opianthony.com.  Just throw, like, opianthony in the search engine of YouTube.  But this is E-Rock, the montage of him getting waxed the other day.  Ah!  F***!  Oh, hey!  Oh, hey!  Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Oh, he had a curse.  Ah! 
[01:02:30]  F***!  Did I hear a curse?  Ah!  He cursed again!  Oh!  No!  Ah!  Oh, what?  What?  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Ah!  Oh, God.  Ah!  Ah!  E-Rock, you cursed.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:03:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's the best part of the video that just went up overnight, the short version.  I got to keep saying it, the short version, because there's a really long version that's  funny too, but the short version gets right to the point, and then at the end, it's E-Rock  falling off the toilet over and over and over again.  The video is really, really funny.  Really funny.  Like five times in a row. 
[01:03:30]  Go to YouTube and get the views up for us, okay, on that one.  It's just crumpled in the corner like Vicky LaMotta.  Yeah.  Smushed between the toilet and the wall.  Oh, I believe it's time, by the way.  It's time to make everyone very happy.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:04:00]  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be right back. 
[01:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:05:30]  What about being indoors in a warm environment makes girls flash?  We love to whip them out Wednesday.  I'm having trouble with my connection today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So I can't see.  E-Rock's able to enjoy it.  Big hi to all the ladies wowing on Pal Talk this morning.  Yeah.  This show, it's like a community.  It's all sorts of different little communities.  It's getting nuts.  They're all over the place.  The videos.  They get together.  They listen to the show.  They flash with each other. 
[01:06:00]  They have orgies.  They're dating.  They're having kids.  It's all crazy.  It's frightening.  All because of this dumb show.  Or it started with this show.  And now they're like shooting off into other things.  But it's under the O.P. and Anthony umbrella.  God, you almost feel responsible.  I know.  It's a little weird.  There's listeners that actually hooked up and had a kid.  Because of this show?  Because of this show?  Yeah.  Like, oh, well, if we weren't doing this, they would never have made that human.  That's going to go on to do things. 
[01:06:30]  Or not.  That is creepy.  Well, the headlines are coming in.  We're looking for you to beat the New York Daily News.  The headline right on the front page.  Dark side of the loon.  It's my favorite so far.  And then they're doing a piece on TV right now.  What makes a person go nuts?  Who the hell knows?  She wanted this guy.  That's what happens with women sometimes.  They get fixated on a guy. 
[01:07:00]  All infatuated.  And will do anything.  Can I ask this stupid question?  Did the guy do anything with the astronaut?  I don't know.  They said that it was more than a professional relationship.  But not a romantic one.  I don't know.  And he's married, right?  The other astronaut?  No, he's single.  Oh, he's single.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  But he was dating somebody else.  And that was the problem.  This crazy astronaut had.  Yeah, young.  She needed her out of the picture, right?  Yep.  And people are saying, wouldn't she have to stop her gas?  So why the diaper?  Or maybe she was carrying her own gas.  Oh, there you go. 
[01:07:30]  Other headlines coming in.  Boston Globe.  Astronaut accused of murderous mission.  Mission, okay.  Boston Herald lost in space.  It should be lost in space like the New York Post had.  Oh, dumb Boston Herald.  Still shaking over the glowing friggin' light bright characters, obviously.  They had to pay $2 million to Boston.  Or a million to Boston and a million to Homeland Security in general, right?  What a shakedown that was.  No kidding, man.  Total shakedown. 
[01:08:00]  Edmonton Sun.  Astronauts fixation out of this world.  It's a little boring, too.  Nut.  And Detroit, free press, astronaut's arrest reveals down-to-earth frailty.  Down-to-earth, isn't that cute?  Kind of dumb.  What about one small step?  Work off that.  Classic.  Classic space line.  One giant dump for mankind.  Because of the diaper.  You think she was dumping in it? 
[01:08:30]  Now that would have been funny.  She decided on mile marker 63 she was just going to let one go.  I love these phone calls.  This is just impossible.  Jessica, Pittsburgh, what's up?  Oh, hello.  Hi.  Hi.  I would just call to let you guys know that I listen to you every day.  We get you guys to the Pittsburgh station now, finally.  Oh, cool.  And you guys almost cost me my job yesterday because I was listening at the office over 
[01:09:00]  the computer, you know, like streaming.  And when Jim Norton said about the Snickers bar and the diabetes losing his foot, I laughed  out loud.  Thank you.  And there were people around me like, oh, what's so funny?  What are you listening to?  I couldn't tell them because they're all fat.  And I was afraid they would have diabetes and be mad at me.  Oh, yeah.  But even a fatty likes a good joke every once in a while.  Sure.  Even at their expense.  Even a fatty likes a good fatso joke.  Yeah.  Well, I'll just follow it up with some comforting carrot cake. 
[01:09:30]  No, I think it just really made me realize how out of, I don't want to say out of my  element, but I'm definitely the youngest person in that office and they would not have appreciated  that.  So I just wanted to, you know, thank you for that.  Oh, okay.  Thank you for that.  Are we blowing up in Pittsburgh yet?  I think so.  How would you know?  Blowing up.  Well, I actually live about an hour north of Pittsburgh, but I get the Pittsburgh station.  And I've seen wild stickers.  Huh.  All right.  That's good.  That's a good sign.  I'd like to know because she's a girl, you know.  Yeah.  And a lot of times we don't know what the ladies like on the program. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, no.  I love you guys.  I think you're hilarious.  What is it about the Opie and Anthony show that you like?  Well.  Do you know, even though I was unprepared for that, I was.  It doesn't get old.  And sometimes we've got to use a different strategy.  Yeah.  Opie's just trying to keep his 100% record.  Yeah.  If she would have said, ah, no, I know that, it would have been my fault.  I've got to pick my spots. 
[01:10:30]  It's getting tougher and tougher every day now.  Lead Belly from Boston there.  He says that the Boston Herald headline should have been, and I need a sound effect from  Anthony, and I didn't set this up ahead of time.  So guess what sound effect you need here, okay, Anthony?  All right.  Let me figure it out.  All right.  Where did he go?  All right.  The headline should have read, recipe for murder.  No, that one.  No.  Recipe for murder.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Because it always works the second time.  What?  Recipe for murder.  Wow.  Sounds harsh.  Drudge has the astronaut Avenger.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Bayshore Times has a headline, Anthony, today. 
[01:11:30]  Astro twat takes shuttle to insanity.  Oh, I see where we're going with this.  Oh, I see now.  I see where we're going with this.  Yeah.  Places we can't go.  We're going to, like, spin this a little bit now.  Hey, here's a ridiculous news story.  If you use them in the crosswalk, your favorite electronic devices could be in the crosshairs.  Legislation will be introduced in Albany tomorrow to lay a hundred dollar...  Why do they always have to...  Do they have to... 
[01:12:00]  I know.  Why?  Just report the story.  Do they have to come up with some friggin' little catchphrase?  Little thing.  I've got to hear that again.  In the crosshairs?  They stink.  Ugh.  If you use them in the crosswalk, your favorite electronic devices could be in the crosshairs.  Legislation will be introduced in Albany tomorrow to lay a hundred dollar fine on pedestrians,  succumbing to what State Senator Carl Krueger calls iPod oblivion.  We're talking about people walking sort of tuned in, and in the process of being tuned 
[01:12:30]  in, tuned out.  Tuned out to the world around them, so they're walking into speeding cars, they're walking  into buses, they're walking into one another, and it's creating, I mean, a number of fatalities  that have been documented right here in the city.  Carl Krueger or Krueger is an ass.  Because these politicians at this point, I think they just sit around and try to figure  out crap to get their faces on the news.  If you're worried about deaths, just why don't you ban alcohol? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you go for this?  That's pretty much it.  Why don't you get really brave iPod?  Go after that.  Go after cigarettes.  It's always the soft.  Yeah.  The soft things.  The soft subjects.  The soft targets.  Woody Allen sound alike.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, what a dope.  It's just, they just want to get their faces on the news.  That's it.  Get a little exposure for themselves.  Ban an iPod.  How are you going to ban an iPod or someone type it on their Blackberry or text it on their  cell phone in a crosswalk? 
[01:13:30]  Because then you'd have to start banning everything.  Like, what if you're reading the paper as you're walking?  Right.  Or doing anything besides just walking and paying attention.  And meanwhile, they're not going to ban blind and deaf people from crossing the street.  Yeah, exactly.  We couldn't be any worse off with an iPod than you are with a dog and no ears.  That's true.  Put an iPod on your dog.  Really try to freak the cops out. 
[01:14:00]  How do we write this up?  I know.  They're all called, every title is wolf.  Is that a waste of time this morning or what?  Oh, it's another one of those things.  Yeah, the safe things like video games and stuff.  This guy's jumping all over this one.  It's a big cause.  He's probably getting compliments this morning.  Hey, got a little ink.  Show you the news.  Hey, that was nice.  He'll go back to obscurity tomorrow.  Yeah.  Just a dope trying to get his name out there. 
[01:14:30]  No one's really caring about the iPod.  And cell phones, by the way.  Blackberries.  He wants all these banned.  So you can't cross the street with any of these.  It's back to having your mommy there.  Don't cross the street.  You're an adult.  Do what you want.  You pay the consequences.  That's what we have in a free society.  Last time I looked, this was America.  And we're free.  Right.  So free.  They're more free in Iraq at this point. 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  Anyone else notice that?  Yeah.  They still get away with whatever the hell they want over there.  Let's go to Todd in Brooklyn.  Todd, what's up?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  What's up, Jim?  You're the best, guys.  Listen, how about this one?  Bark at the loon.  Bark at the loon, sure.  Oh, you're trying to touch on Jimmy's sensitivities.  A little bark at the moon thing.  Ozzy?  Yeah.  Yeah, it works.  He got me.  Yeah.  I love him.  If he was white, you would have liked that a lot more.  No, if he was white, I would have smashed him for it.  In fact, if he's black and he did something that could be interpreted as an Ozzy reference, 
[01:15:30]  I liked it.  Gotta give him credit.  Absolutely.  It's a mellow show today.  Is it?  Yeah, it's mellow.  It's all right.  Bob on Long Island just got wowed on the LIE.  Very nice.  By a hot bitch and a green celebrity in the HOV lane.  See?  It's happening.  Congrats.  Oh, and then we got this guy from yesterday.  He wants to try again today.  Patty Boy from the Bronx. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What's up, Patty Boy?  Patty Boy from the Bronx.  Keep it real.  New York City's the best.  Did he sleep yet?  Huh?  Were you at Anthony's poker game last night?  No, I'm not finished.  No finished.  What's your deal today?  You called late in the show yesterday.  Huh?  What's your deal today?  Um, not making it to work, but waiting for some girl to come over. 
[01:16:30]  How does this guy do this?  Why is the girl coming over?  To bang me.  Yeah?  Oh, sure she is.  That must be a real catch.  All right.  How much?  That's what New York City's all about.  Prostitutes?  Not fat girls and a bursa.  What are you on this morning?  Huh?  What are you on this morning?  What am I on?  Yeah.  Higher life, baby.  No, what are you on?  More than life.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Higher life.  No, what are you on?  Nothing.  You lie.  Yesterday you said you were on something.  So what is it today?  I was on coke.  Yesterday.  I've been up for five days.  Lack of sleep, huh?  Five days.  You know, that's staying up for days on end.  Seems like a good idea.  It's a cheap buzz.  Until you make it to, like, the 20-hour mark, and then you go, what am I doing?  Going to sleep.  This stinks.  Life sucks. 
[01:17:30]  Huh?  Life sucks.  Yeah.  But opening anything, they're the best.  All right.  All right.  We'll pass on the message, sir.  All right.  Patty Boy from the Bronx.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got it.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Hey, Tom, what's up?  Thanks.  You know, guys, I don't think I can follow that.  Yeah, try.  The guy's calling us every morning now.  All right.  I almost want to punch out.  Listen, I'm from the area that that Kruger guy represents. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  What a tool.  He's an embarrassment to your district.  Two things he's done, guys.  Yeah.  We had a Mercedes-Benz dealership on Floppersh Avenue.  He didn't like that they double-parked their cars.  Yeah.  We stood outside with a sign, so they moved.  Thanks.  Well, good.  They go to jobs.  There's not enough problems in that district.  Right.  And then a dollar cab driver runs over somebody, so he's out there with a sign again, yelling 
[01:18:30]  at dollar cab drivers that last week were cutting off people's arms in the Congo.  Good move.  Yeah, well, we're trying to get him on the show today.  We'll see.  I mean, he wants to ban the auto pod.  He's got a platform.  Let's hear from him.  It's just stupid if he's so into it.  Watch out, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  One of the stories that fell through the cracks, because we've been very busy on the show  lately, is this little thing.  This is a cute little story.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  I want to know what happened, because I can't believe it after I went to have my baby. 
[01:19:00]  I went to deliver my baby, and then I came out of the hospital like this.  Claudia Mejia said after she gave birth to Matthew last spring, she was kept in the hospital  with complications.  Twelve days after giving birth at Orlando Regional South Seminole Hospital, she was transported  to Orlando Regional Medical Center in Orlando, where she then became a quadruple amputee.  Now she cannot care for her or hold her baby. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  What the hell happened?  A quadruple amputee?  She had a baby, and they chopped off her arms and legs.  She went home with a baby with no way to hold it.  Wow.  Oh.  Are you kidding me?  Wow.  How'd that happen?  I don't know.  I guess you'll find out.  A whole new house.  I guess you'll find out next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, jeez.  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  To get your official Opie and Anthony wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  During the last break, we were talking about a fine lady that was flashing people on the Long Island Expressway. 
[01:20:30]  Yes.  It is Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  To prove this is going on all the time, we got Linda on the line from her car.  Linda, what's going on?  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good, Linda.  I just wanted to say thank you for the compliment to Bob.  Oh, the guy that you flashed?  Yeah, the guy that I flashed on the LIE.  Yeah.  So, yeah, you flashed this guy on the LIE, and he sent an instant feedback from his phone, 
[01:21:00]  which I think is the coolest thing that people can now instant feedback us from phones.  Right from their phone.  And he said that you had a lovely, lovely set there, Linda.  Thank you.  Can I just say that I love Jim Norton?  Of course.  Oh, boy.  Don't tempt Jimmy.  Thank you.  Jimmy's in love.  Don't tempt Jimmy.  Jimmy, I'm going to hang up on her.  No, I am in love.  How big are they?  My girlfriend would understand.  If I just went... 
[01:21:30]  Are you wowing every week there, Linda?  Actually, I do wow whenever I see a wow sticker, but I don't see that many on the LIE.  See, if I was Joe Commuter, I would just throw the wow on my car for the hell of it and say, you know, what the hell?  Joe Commuter.  Joe Commuter.  Just throw it on the back of my car and see what happens.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what, Linda?  I hear you have a very nice set.  Do not flash anyone unless they have the wow sticker or the homemade wow sign or the wow written in the back of their truck or car. 
[01:22:00]  Okay?  All right.  No problem.  Promise, right?  I promise.  All right.  And call us.  Are you at work right now?  No, I'm still driving into work.  All right.  If you're going to flash anyone else, please give us a call.  Okay, I will.  Because that would be really smart, lifting a shirt with two hands and trying to work a cell phone as you attempt to steer.  And steering, yeah.  Where were we before the break?  All the amputee thing.  Wow, you're good.  What happened?  Huh?  What happened?  Well, we're going to find out what happened.  She had a baby.  She had a baby. 
[01:22:30]  She went into a hospital in Florida, Orlando area, and she came out with a baby, which is what you want when you go into a hospital to give birth.  But she had to leave a few parts.  She had to leave both arms and both legs.  Wow.  This is what happened.  Brutal.  Yeah, I want to pick him off, and I can.  He wants me to pick him off sometimes, and I can.  And that's very hard for me.  Her seven-year-old George asked his mother over and over what happened to her.  Neither she nor her husband have the answer. 
[01:23:00]  I love her, so I'll always stick with her and take a day to tell myself.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Jesus, this is a horrid story.  Oh, my God.  What a nicer guy than I am, because I would dump you in a second.  If you came home with no hands or feet, you're single.  Have your friend type up an ad on match.com for you.  It's not even just hands and feet. 
[01:23:30]  It's arms and legs.  She's got, like, nothing.  Nothing.  Great.  I believe we all would accept maybe one out of the four missing.  Sure.  No way.  All four, though?  Come on.  Match.com.  Looking for a left leg.  Lonely woman.  Seeks anybody breathing.  Have no arms or legs.  Oh, it's horrible.  Well, let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  I just wonder if her husband's going to have to buy one of those double baby papoose things, 
[01:24:00]  you know, where he carried a baby on the back, one for the baby in the front, put her on  the back, or get one of those double strollers, you know, when people have twins, put the baby  in one and her in the other one, or does that say you did?  Stroll mommy around.  How does she ever win?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I was going to say, how does she ever win an argument again?  I mean, no matter what's going on, all he has to do is just glance out the kitchen window  at the pool, and she shuts her mouth. 
[01:24:30]  Or sit side by side in a respective car seat.  Well, I'm just...  All right.  Brokis to you, too, sir.  Oh, God.  Oh, you're awful.  She just, okay, you're right.  You're right.  Yeah, you can't get lippy.  Why would you get lippy?  The mental image conjures up just the little glance out of the side of his eyes at the  pool. 
[01:25:00]  You're horrid.  You want to find out what happened?  Not yet.  We will after...  No, here it is.  The couple wants to know how she caught the streptococcus, the flesh-eating bacteria.  And why?  I just want to know why this happened.  Her attorney, Judy Hyman, wrote Orlando Regional Healthcare Systems a letter saying, according  to this Florida statute, the patient's right to know about Adverse Medical Incidents Act,  the hospital must give her the records. 
[01:25:30]  When the statute's named patient's right to know, I don't know how it could be clearer.  The hospital's lawyers wrote back, Ms. Mejia's request may require legal resolution.  In other words, according to their interpretation of the law, Mejia has to sue them in order to  get information about herself.  Jesus.  Is that...  Obviously, they're holding back something.  A problem.  Yeah.  Someone else in the hospital probably had it.  Yeah.  They didn't take the right precautions. 
[01:26:00]  And there was an oopsie.  An oopsie involved.  Eesh.  Isn't the medical profession disgusting?  You're just a disgusting group of human beings that they couldn't tell this woman what's  going on.  Imagine the person that had it originally was supposed to be, like, quarantined, and then  all of a sudden, the nurse's aide goes, all right, I took care of...  Helping deliver her baby.  I took care of Mrs. Huber.  I put her in room two...  You didn't put her in.  What?  We didn't clean that yet.  It's got to be disinfected.  What?  She was the one whose face was eaten off. 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  Let's go to Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank?  Hey, Frank.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  That story's making me very sad.  Linda's call cheered me up a little bit, but there's something missing, and I just want  to be happy today.  Punch it out.  Are you trying to make me play the happy song?  You can't make me play the happy song.  And I want to know is, how do you get it on your hands and feet?  Yeah.  What did she do?  Just walk down the hospital floor?  Was she, like, scat dancing and putting her hands on the floor? 
[01:27:00]  I don't know what scat dancing is.  I just kind of made it up because I had a weak joke.  This picture of doing cartwheels over syringes.  There you go.  Thank you.  That's what a real joke sounds like.  That's the trick I fired up.  Absolutely brilliant.  I'm doing comedy 17 years, and I can't think of where else your hands and feet would touch 
[01:27:30]  together.  You get hungover and you pull that out of your ass.  Yeah, he's not even here officially today.  At least I got one in.  I can't talk.  Damn.  Oh, gosh.  You got a single up the middle there, Ant.  I really, really screwed up last night.  God, I hate when I do this.  Doesn't happen often.  You don't look too good.  You all right?  I am really...  I've never seen your eyes look heavier in my life.  I felt better when I first came in than I do now.  You got those Italian heavy eyelids to begin with, but today they're like... 
[01:28:00]  I could just do the show like this.  My eyes are shut right now.  Yeah.  And like, I...  I want to kiss you.  I could just nod off.  I just took a little nap.  Let's get to the end of the story here.  She says not knowing exactly why this happened is unbearable.  She only hopes she'll be able to soon answer her little boy's question.  What happened?  He told me every day, Mom, why did the doctors... 
[01:28:30]  What happened?  What happened?  I want to know what happened.  Wow, she can't even say it.  Why did the doctors...  Yeah.  Cut off your arms and legs?  Do we have anything more on this story?  Obviously, it's an older story if the kid's asking questions.  Poor little kid.  Mommy, could you bounce me on your knee?  Okay, let's go to the dumpster by the hospital.  He's doing this in his sleep today.  The thing is, though, like, is the seven-year-old kid, what happened is probably not the one 
[01:29:00]  that she gave birth to.  Oh, okay.  It's not that old of a story.  All right.  How old is...  How long ago was this, Dan?  Let me get Danny on mic here.  Danny.  Well, she gave birth in the spring, but the whole legal process with the hospital going  back and forth, that was just released recently.  All right, let's say hi to Kevin on the Long Island Expressway.  Kevin, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Kevin.  This lady is never going to get the information.  She cannot sue them. 
[01:29:30]  Why?  She doesn't have a leg to stand on.  That old gag, but it still gets a chuckle.  It certainly does.  It still gets a chuckle.  It certainly does.  You did not go there.  It certainly does.  I mean, would she have any input in financial situations?  She might go, look, I want this money put toward this, and he might just go, you know  what, and then put her on the linoleum and spin her and walk out of the room. 
[01:30:00]  I don't know why I find this fun.  It's just horrific.  It's just silly things you could do to mom.  It's funny because we don't know them.  That's how it goes.  I hear one of the lawyers for the hospital is English, and he's not threatened at all  because she seems armless.  Another old gag. 
[01:30:30]  Let's say hi to Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  No hands.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Did you notice that reporter's name was Judy Hyman?  Was it really?  I thought her...  Her last name was Hyman.  I believe.  I thought it was a lawyer.  The second off, did you ever see that cartoon on Adult Son, The Oblongs?  The Oblongs.  She looks like one of them, right?  Yeah.  The father.  He has no arms or legs.  He's just like a being or something.  He's a fully functional parent and everything.  What is the Oblong cartoon all about? 
[01:31:00]  It's about...  And he fell right in.  Speaking of body parts, bring them in.  That poor lady's had to quit her job.  Bring them in.  Just rent her arms and legs out at the pest door for birds to stand on.  Drop off the parts at the pirate pawn shop.  Sit over there, ladies.  Oh, no.  Fantastic.  And we only get one lady?  Hi.  What's up with the other lady?  She's just... 
[01:31:30]  She's my people.  Oh, she's your lover?  Oh, no.  I'm gonna...  Huh?  I'm gonna woof from this.  I've heard of this.  Yeah, this is not a good day to do this.  It's a horrible day.  Yeah, Anthony's very hungover.  He played poker all night.  I was playing poker all night.  With the listeners.  They're a bad influence on him.  Oh, I was drinking.  And I...  A weekday.  It was Tuesday night.  What?  What kind of insanity is that?  I don't understand.  Thursday, because it's almost a weekend.  Thursday's almost a weekend.  But Tuesday is just silly.  You actually have a little hope.  You go, all right, tomorrow's Friday. 
[01:32:00]  I can...  But no.  I can skate.  I can skate a little bit.  Not today.  By the way...  Yeah.  I am announcing rescheduling of John Minnelli's meeting.  For Thursday.  I can't do Thursday.  It'd be me and him.  Very romantic.  It's true.  Just two men.  You can maybe land her as tie.  I'll let you know definitely by 11.  All right.  But it is looking grim.  I've got to...  I've got to get home.  To my bed.  After the show.  I'm a trooper.  I'm a professional.  Of course. 
[01:32:30]  I'll rise above.  I'll do the show.  Your color's changing, though.  Are you going to puke?  I might if I look at this stuff.  Yeah, this is why she's here today.  These are very...  It's a pretty famous exhibit.  Oh, I know.  Let me tell you.  Yes, we got...  What's your name?  Cheryl Muray.  All right.  And you're part of the Bodies...  Bodies the Exhibition.  The Exhibition.  I saw it in Philly.  One of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life.  One of the most amazing things.  And I know that you have it in New York as well, down at the...  At the Seaport.  At the Seaport, right.  You want to explain what Bodies the Exhibition is all about for the newbies out there? 
[01:33:00]  It's real human bodies that have been dissected and displayed in a very respectful way, taking  you on a journey through your own body.  Right.  The dissections take you through the skeletal system, muscular, nervous, circulatory, all  the way through your entire body.  So you can learn about yourself from the inside out.  Cool.  Where do they get these people?  We work with our partner at the medical university in China. 
[01:33:30]  China?  And they do the dissections there and they loan us the bodies.  We're displaying them around the world.  Yeah, but I've been...  Like I said, I've been to the show.  Like, who would agree to have their body on display like this after they die?  Falun Gong?  Teasing, of course.  Please.  It seems...  It seems...  He's angry with me.  It seems a little shady.  It does.  Well, these are the body...  At Bodies Exhibition here at the Seaport, the bodies and the body parts are from unclaimed  bodies that have been donated to the medical university for education and for research. 
[01:34:00]  So our main goal is to help you learn more about your body, which we hope you did when  you saw the exhibition.  Do you have, like...  Because I think that you add a little humor.  Like, do you have, like, funny displays?  Like, if someone's head was caved in, you have, like, have them in front of a football  game talking.  The other person, I thought we had candidates.  They actually do have a sense of humor with some of the displays.  Yeah.  They have people holding...  I think I saw one body where the person was actually holding their own skull or their 
[01:34:30]  own brain.  Well, at the Bodies Exhibition here at the Seaport, we actually have a dissection of the  skeletal system holding on to its own muscular system.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty neat.  That's great.  I saw the basketball player.  They got a guy, obviously a black dude, for many...  Really?  It was very obvious for many reasons, because they don't censor this, by the way.  Oh, so...  You see everything.  All the parts.  Everything.  All the parts.  And they show a guy in a basketball pose like he's... 
[01:35:00]  I forgot if he was dribbling or shooting a basketball, and his skin is pretty much stripped  off his body, but you see all the muscles.  Exactly.  Exactly.  In the muscular gallery of the exhibition, we want you to be able to see how the muscles  and tendons and nerves all layer together, and putting the bodies in an athletic pose  like that gives people something that they can relate to.  Was his penis visible?  Is that what you meant?  Like, you could tell?  Oh, yeah.  They have all the genitals of the bodies exposed.  He must look great in front of all the other Asians.  He must be the star of the exhibit. 
[01:35:30]  We went in Philly, and it was amazing, but there were two things that freaked me out.  They have a body of a woman that's pregnant, and she was pretty much close to giving birth  when I guess she died.  Well, in Philadelphia, that is an exhibition there.  That one here at...  It's different.  I understand.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but the one I saw, she was pregnant, and I think they had a cross-section where the  baby was still inside her.  That creeped me out.  Oh, wow.  That one creeped me out.  And then there was another one where they had a horse dead with a guy on top of the 
[01:36:00]  horse, all the skin removed, so you see the muscles of the horse, and then the muscles  of the guy sitting on the horse.  Right.  That was in the Philadelphia exhibition, and here in New York, the body's the exhibition,  and we don't have any animals on display there.  So that's a different exhibition.  How is that done?  Like, how do they do this to people?  It's a polymer preservation process, so...  Polymer.  Yeah.  All of those...  Space-age polymers. 
[01:36:30]  Fluids are removed from the body, and the silicone is inserted down to the cellular level,  so it hardens.  Oh, so...  And then pose so that they are like that indefinitely.  So they don't...  Yeah, they're not going to rot away or anything.  They're not going to rot away.  Yeah, they blast.  You're able to see inside.  It's a very inspiring and educational and very fascinating exhibition.  Yeah, and when we went, the kids weren't freaked out by this.  There were a lot of kids checking them out.  Basically, you're walking around in a room with dead bodies.  So they get home at night, try to go to sleep. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Well, she brought some body parts.  Oh, no.  What did you bring?  I wish you brought, like, an entire person.  That would have been hilarious to bring into the studio today.  Hard to get that through security.  Right.  Stupid-ass ass with the cyan.  Are you ready for that?  What did you...  That's a...  Oh, my goodness.  What do you think that is?  That is a half of a brain.  That's half of a brain.  This is actually a very unhealthy brain.  Is it?  Yes.  You can see by all the spaces.  Yeah, because it's cut in half.  It is cut in half, but you can see all the spaces here. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's supposed to be all nice and...  Nice and tight.  ...together.  Yeah, nice and tight.  I like a tight brain.  So this shows that the impulses would have to move across those spaces, so the brain activity  would be very slow.  Oh.  So this is probably from someone with dementia.  Dementia?  Yeah.  Here, take them.  No, I don't like handling it.  I won't handle it.  But Jimwell.  Jimwell.  Can you hear that, Sam?  Hand me that brain.  Jimwell.  Thanks.  I'll brain you.  It kind of...  It feels like a...  It's like plasticized. 
[01:38:00]  You're smelling the brain.  Yeah, why not?  It doesn't feel like plastic.  It feels like a weird type of a rubber, like a hard rubber.  Right.  The silicone is a silicone rubber, so that's what you're feeling there.  Oh, God.  I'm holding the brain of a dope.  What a worthless item this was.  Like shoes at that lady's house.  I got dirt.  Wow, this is pretty cool, though.  Dirt.  Petting the brain.  You want to hold it?  It's pretty cool. 
[01:38:30]  There we go.  It doesn't model me a bit.  Oh, he's holding.  Do you want to hold it?  No.  Why?  It kind of creeps me out a little bit.  Do you have a liver you could pass around and maybe one he could have?  I actually...  It's preserved right now.  Funny you should say that.  Oh, no.  Funny?  Yeah.  Oh, that is a liver.  Can I bite into the brain?  I don't think it would taste very good.  I wouldn't.  Oh, don't, don't.  Oh, it'll be.  That looks like a relatively healthy liver.  That is a very healthy liver.  Look.  Look at all that.  That's a liver of a person that didn't drink on a Tuesday night. 
[01:39:00]  And played poker all night.  Yeah, I know.  But they had a boring life.  It looks like clay.  It feels like clay.  Yeah, like, this thing looks like a big shell.  And then you turn it upside down.  It's got two little tubes.  And what's this little sack?  That's the gallbladder.  Ugh.  And if you squeeze on it...  It's got some gall.  It's got bile in there.  Bile?  Is that, like, waste?  Feces?  Yes, that's what's filtering through the blood and toxins through the liver. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, look, it's soft.  I bet if I bit into that, I could...  Yeah, you want to hold it?  No.  And hold the liver.  No.  How big is your liver?  I'm not holding anything.  How tall is this guy?  Like, 11 feet?  No, that's the largest internal organ.  It weighs about three pounds.  Oh, my God.  You know what the largest organ is on your body?  Largest internal.  Notice you said internal organ.  I know what the largest organ on the body is, Anthony.  Opie?  Your skin.  Yay.  Very good.  I thought it depended on race. 
[01:40:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  That's a liver Opie's holding there.  Is this the doodum?  No, it's that.  Is that the...  That's your gallbladder.  Oh, okay.  It looks like a doodum.  How much are these worth?  They're priceless.  Are they?  Yes.  What is that?  This is a very healthy heart.  Oh.  Well, not anymore.  Yeah, exactly.  It was a healthy heart and a very healthy person. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, wow.  Do you have any, like, really bad ones?  Ooh.  It's like...  You can feel it.  It's, like, kind of soft where the arteries and stuff would come out or whatever.  It's kind of, like, soft.  This really is real.  Because you think it's going to be hard plastic, but it's not.  Hey, we missed a joke.  We got to back up.  John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering, how did she get half of Kenny's brain?  And he still functions, which is amazing.  Okay.  Eatamore.com.  Thank you, sir.  I'll be this weekend at the comedy place.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  This is kind of weird.  Let me see the...  I'm holding a heart.  You're holding a heart.  Oh, just in time for Valentine's Day.  For Valentine's Day.  Shut up.  You have a little heart, Hopi.  So this is a healthy heart?  A very healthy heart.  This looks like all, like, fat.  Like when you go to the supermarket and you get a chicken breast and the skin's on it.  Okay.  Is that fat, you think?  No, that's the shape and size of your heart.  Wow.  Why do you have to sniff the various organs? 
[01:41:30]  Well, it smells like clay.  It smells like it's not real.  Who's clay?  Akin.  Smells like onion.  Very nice.  So that's a healthy heart.  Yeah.  A very healthy heart.  We're taking pictures for the website.  It's pretty bizarre to hold it.  So what do you get to see at the New York exhibit?  Because obviously you don't want to talk about the Philly exhibit.  Right.  You get to see over 20 full bodies on display in the various galleries of the exhibition.  You see over 250 different body parts, different pathologies, healthy lungs, smokers' lungs. 
[01:42:00]  That has a great impact on people.  Yeah.  We actually have a big acrylic case in the respiratory gallery for people to toss out their cigarettes once they see.  Oh, they see the...  See, but look at the actual just body parts.  It doesn't humanize the experience.  I mean, you've got to go to bodies, the exhibition, to see the complete bodies they've got on display.  That's where it gets creepy and really amazing.  Right.  It really is.  It's extremely educational.  As a matter of fact, this week we're hosting over 800 teachers from in and around New York City to come and take a look at the exhibition. 
[01:42:30]  We have hosted over 75,000 school kids from the tri-state area that are coming there to learn more about their bodies as part of their science classes.  Now, the Philly exhibit, obviously, there's a whole, like, war going on with New York.  Right.  Two mob families going at it.  Are you guys tied in with the same company or do you just...  No.  That's a competitor exhibition.  Is it really?  What?  It sounds like the same thing.  It's the same process that's used to preserve the body. 
[01:43:00]  All you had to do was tell us that and then we would have stopped talking about Philly.  I thought it was like a franchise.  No.  Like, you get all these dead bodies and you set up your own dead body shop.  You trade them like free agents.  Right.  Look, the heart wants more money or it's going to Philly.  But it's the same, like, literature.  Enough about Philly.  And logo and stuff.  Now, this is Bodies the Exhibition.  Right.  We're here in New York.  We're in Las Vegas for all your Vegas listeners.  We're in Miami.  Oh, there's something going on with Philly.  Looks like there was a divorce or something. 
[01:43:30]  Wait, what's it called in Philly?  Bodies the Exhibition.  It's called Body World.  Oh, Body World.  But we're not here to promote that.  Body World stinks.  What a dumb name.  Yeah, we don't...  Body World.  It's like a porno booth.  Yeah, we hate them.  I prefer Bodies the Exhibition.  Of course.  Bodies the Exhibition.  That's all he had to say.  I'm saying it.  We realized there was something that was very uncomfortable about Philly.  Body's the Exhibition is actually much better because they talk.  They have, like, little...  They're still living, half of them.  And they're just against their will being held there. 
[01:44:00]  Now, that would be an exhibit.  But I don't think that's the way it's set up, Jimmy.  This is going to sound like a joke, but this is true.  Colin from Brooklyn.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I went to this show in New York, and I went with my wife.  All she could fixate on was the fact that even if they removed everybody's skin,  they left a little one-inch circle around everybody's anus,  and they're all...  Everybody's got their butthole, and they're all covered in hair.  All the girls, all the guys, they got nice little fuzzy butt mustaches.  Really?  Yeah.  They didn't remove that part of the body. 
[01:44:30]  I wonder why.  I don't know.  Why didn't they?  The anus, is it removed or no?  I don't know.  I'm trying to ask you, like, a doctor.  Like, there's just too many professionals talking.  Right, right.  Guys, we have eyelashes, and some body hair remains on some of the full-body specimens.  Wow.  No answer to that.  This is a good question from Tom in Call River.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, I got a question.  Do these bodies have faces?  Because that creeped me out a little bit.  Oh, they do have faces. 
[01:45:00]  They do.  With their skin removed, in most cases, and their eyeballs still in their heads.  Exactly.  Well, as long as the skin's on, I can't see them, I guess.  All right.  Now I've got to go see the one in New York, because I thought it was the same thing as  the other place that we don't mention anymore.  Well, we want you to come down to the seaport and take a look.  Come see us in Vegas.  Yeah, we're on in Vegas.  Absolutely.  Where are you guys in Vegas?  We're at the Tropicana.  Oh, okay.  Come see us there.  I'm sorry.  Have you had any incidents, like problems, like, you know, with people misbehaving or doing  weird things? 
[01:45:30]  Because, you know, the public, a bunch of bums, so there might have been a problem.  No, we don't have any problems.  We have people that are just fascinated, spend hours inside the exhibition, going from gallery  to gallery.  Kids that look at the human bodies and immediately relate to it and see their own hearts and lungs,  and they get very excited about that.  So we haven't had any incidents.  No.  How close can you get to these things?  You can get very, very close.  Yeah.  They're not roped off.  We want you to really look.  Oh, so you can take pictures with them and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  There's no photography.  Oh, no photography. 
[01:46:00]  We want you to buy the book.  Oh, man.  I got you.  You got any pictures to show these guys?  Cindy has some catalogs that we brought for you guys.  Well, yeah.  Let's see a catalog real fast.  And we have some T-shirts for you from Bodies, the exhibition.  Oh.  I don't need T-shirts.  So we want you to wear these.  Enjoy that.  I like the Philly shirt I got, so.  Let me get all the Philly thing.  Stop.  Let's go to Nina in Jersey.  Nina.  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Nina. 
[01:46:30]  I thought I'd give you a little more insight.  I was in the exhibition in Philly as well.  That one's called Body Worlds, and it's actually from a German guy, a professor that invented this  entire process.  So I think a lot of people are children from the exhibition Bodies in New York.  It's kind of a rip-off.  All right.  All right.  Enough about Philly.  Yeah.  The guys are now, isn't that amazing?  We're looking, the cover is a guy, skin completely removed.  This is a shot of his back, but it's the whole body. 
[01:47:00]  You see his muscles.  You see the spinal cord.  And they removed the skull, and the brain is still in its head without the skull around  it.  You don't realize how little things are hanging off you.  There's little pieces inside hanging off where the skin would cover.  There's one with this Asian guy running.  Yeah.  This is why the exhibit is amazing.  Look at that.  You've got a basketball player.  Wow.  It's an entire body without the skin.  His eyes are still in his head, and he's going up for a jump shot as a, you can't call 
[01:47:30]  it a skeleton because the muscle's still there and ligaments.  Wow.  That is really cool.  And his baby maker is still on as well.  He's packing one and a half.  Yeah, that's got to be a white guy.  That's awful.  Take a look, Kenny.  How cold is it in this exhibit?  How humiliating.  You die, and your privates are on display forever.  I know.  And you weren't packing in real life.  Yeah, however they want to display it. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, let's say hi to Liz in Jersey.  Liz, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm not sure if it's the same exhibit, but I went to one in Chicago, and they actually  have a separate section where there are every stage of a baby, like a baby being, you know,  a fertilized baby, and they had an eight-month-old inside the mother's womb.  Yeah, what was Chicago?  Hold on.  It was a whole room.  Liz, when I went to the show in Philly, I know exactly what you're talking about.  Like, the first display started as something you could barely see in a jar, and then month 
[01:48:30]  by month by month, they had different, you know, what this thing would be every month.  Yeah, and they had, like, a warning, right, before you went in?  Yeah.  Like, you know, this is kind of, it's not PG-13.  I'm getting a look.  I don't think they're associated with the Chicagoans either, are they?  Are you?  We are not.  Oh, wow.  We do have a, well, we have a fetal gallery like she's describing.  Who knew people were fighting over dead bodies? 
[01:49:00]  I know.  Do you guys go, like, to each other's thing and see if you, make sure they're not stealing  your idea of body positioning?  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, if they see something cool in your exhibit.  It's like we invented that.  Yeah.  All right, Liz, but you like the, you like the show in Chicago?  Oh, it's fantastic.  I mean, it's the same idea, so it's dynamite.  Look, she doesn't want to say it, but obviously the displays are very similar, so I really  enjoyed what I saw in Philly, so I would say that people should see it here in New York.  Absolutely.  Or in Vegas.  Or in Vegas, right. 
[01:49:30]  Or in Seattle.  Or in Seattle.  Or in Miami.  I bet you in Seattle, one of the bodies is holding a cup of joe, isn't it?  Yeah.  Well, they're all suicide victims.  Depressing city.  Oh, they're holding umbrellas in the afterlife, too.  It rains.  A bunch of bodies in long sweaters.  All melancholy.  With long hair to their shoulders.  Let's go to Jen in Westchester.  Jen.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hi.  Good.  I was just wondering, I have a daughter who's in eighth grade, and right now they're studying 
[01:50:00]  biology in school, and they're actually learning all about the things that you're talking about  this morning.  I'd love to take her, and I haven't really heard you go and keep telling about where  this exhibition is and how long it'll be there.  It's at that museum in Philly.  Oh.  What?  It's in Philly.  South Street Seaport.  South Street Seaport.  South Street Seaport, and we're selling tickets right now through May.  Yeah.  If you get down to South Street Seaport, I was down there a few months back, and it's 
[01:50:30]  very obvious where the display is, because they've got signs everywhere.  Right.  And do you have a website?  Yes.  It's BodiesTheExhibition.com.  This is really cool.  Okay.  And do you, are you open seven days?  Seven days a week.  You can buy tickets at BodiesTickets.com.  Of course they're open seven days.  People need days off.  Yeah, they don't need days off.  Okay, thanks.  They're not unionized.  They're dead.  All right.  Kenny, what do you got with your half a brain?  Oh, you have some free tickets you could give that poor lady? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Oh.  I guess I could.  We don't do that.  How much are tickets?  Tickets for adults are $26 and $27.  What's the $1 difference for?  Weekends and holidays.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Very cool.  Wow.  I want to go see this.  Check it out.  Maybe you can win the free tickets.  Hope you saw the crappy one.  Now you can go see the good one.  Come and see the good one.  The one in Philly stinks because they're actually mannequins.  They just stole them from Macy's.  Leave my Philly alone.  Painted them.  Come in my second hometown there. 
[01:51:30]  Why is that body wearing a polo sweater and a skew wig on?  In Philly, they were just throwing batteries at all the displays.  Yeah.  Boeing them.  Boeing them.  Heckling comics.  That's all you got.  They gave up their body to science.  And I'm sure they didn't volunteer for this.  Let's be honest.  A bunch of dumb cadavers and evil jerseys.  Right.  Here you go.  Here's another display.  A baseball player.  Oh, wow.  Right.  That's in the respiratory gallery.  Completely whole except for his skin. 
[01:52:00]  Getting ready to throw a fastball.  Once again, with his junk still intact.  Wow.  You sick people.  Nice.  How about he doesn't do a head first slide?  All right.  This is really cool.  So how many bodies do you have, actually?  We have 22 full bodies and over 250 body parts in the different galleries of the exhibition.  Wow.  Wow.  This is great.  So you guys are in New York, Vegas, Miami, Seattle world?  We're in Amsterdam getting ready to open up in Brazil. 
[01:52:30]  We'll be in Pittsburgh this fall.  Brazil where?  I've been to Rio a couple of times.  Sao Paulo.  I've never been there.  Yeah.  I don't know what the prostitution scene is like, but if it's anything like it is, I  can hit the display while I'm down there paying for indigenous sex.  Wow.  That's very cool.  I went to exhibit, found it educational.  I just found it creepy and very interesting.  Yeah.  Whatever you see, these are real bodies.  Ugh.  Hairs.  Yeah.  We all know we have money.  After 18, why are you still educating yourself? 
[01:53:00]  Nah.  That kind of helps.  It's like we always say on this show, learning's for queers.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thank you very much.  Very interesting.  Seeing those organs makes me want to kind of vomit a little, but yeah, get queasy.  Hopefully make you want to take better care of your own body.  See, there you go.  No.  I'm not usually like this, I swear.  I'll swear.  All right. 
[01:53:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks.  We're just doing our impression of the exhibit.  Standing still.  Thank you.  It was a pleasure.  The seaport.  I'll take your body parts and beat it.  Why?  She's very nice.  She's been a sweet woman talking about it. 
[01:54:00]  Thank you.  Lovely lady is handing out some T-shirts for us.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's a pleasure.  Take care.  All right.  Oh, no.  I'm fine.  Thanks.  I don't want to touch any of that.  All right.  Why don't you walk about, Kenny?  You are despicable. 
[01:54:30]  You are despicable.  I bet you did it because I was going to start hitting on the other one.  Got a relationship.  You're in love.  Will you stop?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  I just got wild.  I got wild.  I'm Sam.  Oh, thank God for Opie and Anthony.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed. 
[01:55:00]  Get happy.  Details on opieandanthony.com.  Way to go, O and A.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Wow, it's good.  We might have to soften up the music.  I think you were on to something yesterday.  It's a little too, like, hardcore.  We love to rock, but a lot of people, you know, they set their alarm clock to this show. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  I mean, now it's late in the morning, obviously, but we have the same type of music very early on.  People are like, oh, God.  Yeah, they wake up and it's being bludgeoned by this music.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  And we could play a little game of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Was it educational?  I do believe so.  I'm going to go to that exhibit, man.  I'm not being polite either.  I want to go see that.  I really want to go see the Bodies. 
[01:56:00]  It's probably one of the cooler things I've seen in a very long time.  A very long time.  A little vague.  A lot of controversy.  They're trying to figure out where the bodies came from.  Yeah, they're a little vague on where those bodies came from.  And all that stuff.  Like, who would agree that they'd had their loved one on display like this, you know, shooting  a basketball for eternity with no skin on its body?  I thought it was going to be more like the question in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, you  know?  They're homeless vagrants and stuff. 
[01:56:30]  And then, whoa, gnarly.  Yeah.  But apparently they were a little vague about where these guys come from.  There was one part of the exhibit.  I can't even really.  It was just the capillaries and the veins of a person.  I forgot to ask her.  How the hell did they do that?  Everything was removed, but the body or the capillaries and everything were still in the  shape of the human being it came from.  And the one I saw in Philly had a mother holding her son that could have been more than two. 
[01:57:00]  But everything was removed except for the capillaries and that whole inner working thing.  The heart, the arteries, the veins, and the capillaries.  The circulatory system.  Thank you.  Exactly.  And it was in the shape of these two bodies on display.  Just amazing stuff.  Had another one with the brain and all the nerves, which is kind of weird, too.  How do you get that out?  But some of the displays are just creepy. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, the guy on a horse with everything removed, I mean, the skin and everything removed.  And then one, they show motion by, it was a runner, I guess, and everything was removed.  Once again, I keep saying this, I know, but the skin is removed.  I'm trying to give you a visual.  And everything else is still there.  The bones, the heart, the muscles, the ligaments, all that other stuff is still there.  And then they kind of pushed everything out to the back so it looks like motion, like the person running. 
[01:58:00]  Like he's running and his muscles are kind of flying in the breeze.  Yeah, like it's wearing its own cape or whatever, you know what I mean?  So they get really crazy with the actual exhibits of these people.  I'd love to be displayed like that.  The thing about death that creeps me out, what a great place to be in a museum where you're naked and people are looking at you.  It's like the thing that creeps me out is being in a box in the dirt, man.  You would.  That's claustrophobic and cold and frightening.  I know, it's not.  Oh, it's awful.  Your spirit's gone. 
[01:58:30]  Maybe it is.  Way before that.  Who knows?  Your spirit's floating around somewhere before it gets to that point.  You never get to feel that feeling.  You're probably right, but I'm not chancing it.  I want to be naked in a museum having a few laughs, knowing that all these school children are walking by and it's totally legal what I'm doing.  Did Al dump out of that whole backdoor conversation with the exhibits?  Why?  It wasn't dirty.  I'm just asking.  Because that part, yeah, they didn't remove that part for some reason.  Kevin in White Plains.  And you see all the kids kind of going to the back of the displays and looking. 
[01:59:00]  Laughing.  And just laughing.  All right, Kevin in White Plains, what's up?  A couple of things for ongoing education.  I worked in a meatpacking plant when I was a kid.  Yeah.  And when they're processing sheep, they save the whole hide.  And there's these guys that punch it out and break all the connective tissue.  And there's one thing holding it on when it's done, and that's the ring piece.  The ring, okay.  And because the tissue is so, the skin is so thin that you can't really separate it from the muscle, which is the sphincter behind it. 
[01:59:30]  So that's probably why they're left on with those guys.  What I had to do was just cut the whole thing out and throw the hide in one chute.  And then I would flick what was on my finger onto the floor, and I'd be knee-deep in.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Right.  Oh, God damn.  I'm getting shocked.  I do, too.  Every time I stand up.  What the F was that?  Every time I stand up.  Holy crap.  I'm done.  You're getting shocked?  Every time I stand up, I get shocked here.  What the hell was that?  Creepy. 
[02:00:00]  It happens to me every day.  If you want to fire us, just do it.  I know the tin floors aren't helping.  They electrocute us.  What the hell was that?  Dude, I get it every time I stand up here.  Are you kidding me?  No, why do you think every once in a while I yell?  Did you touch the mic and then got shocked?  No, and you stand up with the rubber shoes.  Stand up right now and walk.  You'll be shocked.  Oh, my God.  I have no...  Let me see.  Is that guy still there?  Kevin, I got to go.  Yeah.  I'm here.  What was that?  I'll do it to myself.  Dude. 
[02:00:30]  No, stop.  Don't touch me.  Dude, I've been shocked before, but that was way more than just a little static electricity  or whatever.  I get it every time.  So what the hell?  I don't know.  Well, they got to fix that by tomorrow.  That is creepy.  It's making, like, static.  Yes.  It's all over the place.  You're supercharged.  Dude, I get it, too.  If you have one foot attached to the chair, you're okay.  But if you have rubber soles and you step on the thing, you get a bad zapping.  Steve, this has to be fixed by tomorrow. 
[02:01:00]  That was beyond creepy.  It's coming out over the mics, too.  You can hear it.  Yeah, well, that was hitting all my ears.  Tom, no joke.  That was scary.  Wait, let's see if you can hear it in this.  I can hear it walking down.  You can hear it on the air, right?  That went right through me.  Oh, my God.  It just happened again.  Yeah, I get shocked every day when I get up.  The hell is going on?  I already went to human resources.  Is this the first day?  Huh?  I've never had that happen. 
[02:01:30]  I guess Jimmy's had it happen before.  How many times, Eric, have I asked you for that static spray?  How many times have I got the face in the studio?  Yeah.  I demand it.  Oh, there it is.  Crack his little chubby face.  Try some.  It's behind you.  Man has it.  Let's go to David in Pennsylvania.  We'll...  Or not.  We'll try to...  Thanks, sweetie.  Spray your shoes.  That helps with me.  All right.  Let's say hi to David.  David, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was listening to NPR like two months ago, and they said that both exhibitions procured 
[02:02:00]  their bodies illegally.  Oh, yeah.  If that was the case, they would just shut down these exhibits, wouldn't they?  They tried to produce all of the documents and where they procured them, and they didn't  find the documents, or they were taken from jails and things like that.  Well, I did a little research, and this procedure of getting the bodies to look like this or  whatever was invented by a German doctor, of course. 
[02:02:30]  Of course it was.  Yeah, of course it was.  And then people were like, all right, that's fine and dandy, but where the hell did you get  the bodies?  Like in the early 40s.  Someone is...  Nick from Ocean Grove.  Now we're really distracted.  Everyone's...  Well, more than one now.  Ha ha.  Opie's a shock jock.  Ha ha ha.  Watch that, guys.  Thanks, David.  Be good, Dave.  Thanks.  Let's say hi to Gary.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Gary.  Hey, today I learned that the doghouse is much better than your show.  Not a fan? 
[02:03:00]  Ah.  Why'd you hang up?  They always hang up.  They don't hang up.  Why do they hang up?  They blurt something out and then hang up.  If you like their show, then you like their show.  You listen.  What do you want from me?  Nate in Atlanta, what's up?  Hey, my buddy.  Hey, Nate.  Hey, uh...  Yeah, I was in San Francisco last year, and I went to this exact exhibition.  I think they were on tour out there.  But all the bodies...  It was one peculiarity.  All the bodies had bathrobes full of tissues and were holding bowls of broth. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  You're a goose.  A frunkus.  Not too bad.  And he ends with a frunkus.  By the way, all the people keep asking me what frunkus means.  It's a derivative from two different languages, and you all know that's exactly what I was  talking about.  Right.  All right.  Let's go to Phil in Maine.  Phil, what did you learn on this dopey show today?  Today on the show, I learned to never buy a used computer from Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Now, there's nothing on there that's illegal, sir.  That was kind of funny.  That you actually bought your girlfriend a computer because she wanted to check her email when 
[02:04:00]  she was over at your house.  I got a beautiful MacBook.  I'm plugging them.  It's just what I got.  And I gave it to her.  And now I have to buy her her own upgraded one because I bought myself the best one you  can get, and she's using the older one.  And I know she thinks I'm a real chisler because for Christmas, I was like looking around.  Cheapo.  But it was for myself.  It's like we had our hopes up.  It was a big box, and it wasn't for her.  All right.  Let's say hi to Paco in Jersey.  Paco.  Paco.  Hey, guys.  It sounded like you got one foot in the exhibit already with that electrical problem. 
[02:04:30]  That was scary, man.  That was more than just a little, you know, when you used to have fun as a kid and shock  each other.  Yeah.  You could hear it on the air.  That was going through my whole skull.  I did learn something today.  What, sweetie?  When it comes to handling body parts, Anthony seems like he might be rhyming with a word  that sounds like woofy.  Wow.  That's awful.  Sorry, Anthony.  It's true, but the way you put it was really bad.  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:00]  What did you learn today?  I don't know.  I had to do a 45-minute setup that paid off with nothing.  Nothing.  Danny in Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to say what did I learn today.  Okay.  I didn't learn anything because learning's for queers.  Learning is for queers.  Is that what you said?  Yeah.  Punching out.  Hey, Danny, you're in Buffalo, right?  Yeah.  How much snow are you guys up to?  Oh, God.  They just don't see it coming. 
[02:05:30]  Greg in Brooklyn, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Listen, at the Bodies exhibition, I was there about a couple times.  I've actually been there on two dates.  I'm really sick.  There's actually one exhibit.  Was it part of the exhibit?  Just go there, slip it in.  Dude, what do you say to a date at that exhibit?  Like, look what happened to this one.  She probably died when she said no.  Well, one of them ended up, she should have ended up at the exhibit. 
[02:06:00]  She was a total, whatever.  So figure out, there's one guy that's there.  You know how, like, two little kids would, like, hold hands and just, like, sort of go in the circle, like, bring around the Rosie?  Yeah.  There's an exhibit where this one guy, you have his whole muscular, you know, system, and his skeleton is on the other side, and he's sort of doing the same exact pose.  It's, like, the coolest frickin' thing you'll ever see.  With his own skeleton.  Yeah, I mean, they're not just, like, displays.  They've got some artists involved to really make sure.  Oh, yeah, I mean, like I said, I was there twice, and, I mean, you need to go there twice unless you spend, like, a good six hours, because you want to read everything. 
[02:06:30]  No, you don't.  Also, the circulatory system is probably the coolest stuff that you guys were talking about before.  Yeah.  They inject a dye, so this way, like, the arteries and the veins and everything, they just have it blue and red.  It's the coolest frickin' thing you guys will ever see.  Yeah, that was definitely really cool.  All right, thank you, sir.  All right, peace out.  It's Greg in Brooklyn.  A lot of people warning Kenny to stay away from the broadcast area with that dry hair of yours.  Oh, right.  A shock could just set the whole place ablaze. 
[02:07:00]  It's not even hair.  Kenny has, like, brown foam insulation on his head.  It's a winterizer.  And then we got Jeremy from Kansas.  I guess maybe I deserve this, but he writes,  Opie, you, sir, are a huge pussy, a little static shock, and you jump around the studio like a two-year-old girl.  I used to get them, too, when I was five and rubbed my socks on the carpet.  I'm telling you, it was more than that.  Not like that.  I'm telling you, it was more than that.  You could hear it over the radio.  I want to plug Friday, Saturday in Albany. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, you're going to be in Albany?  Yeah.  So I hope the weather's okay.  It could be cold.  I know.  Where are you performing in Albany?  Comedy Works in Albany.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh.  Friday, Saturday.  Musica.  Yeah, music.  Run over to XM.  This one-degree weather is disgusting.  Oh, that's a little warmer today.  Is it?  Just a little bit.  A little bit.  I'm going to get my teeth whitened.  I don't know how bright to make them.  I want to make them, like, really horish bright. 
[02:08:00]  Embarrassing Hollywood bright.  Oh, it's a bright smile.  So let's hope they don't put my teeth up.  Charlie and Philly, we end with you today.  Yes.  Charlie.  Yo.  Erfie and Anthony and Jimmy.  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  Good.  Make it fast.  We've got to get out of here and get over to XM.  I learned today that Anthony likes the company of his listeners better than his co-workers.  Oh.  Yeah, I learned that, too.  That's true.  I learned that me and Ope both get hurt feelings.  I wish I had kept everybody home and slept. 
[02:08:30]  Thank God I almost have thick skin.  I'm a disaster.  Me and Ope go to each other places sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  We always have, like, a little thing set up for you, like Seder.  All right.  All right.  The music is saving us.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.

[02:12:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.

[02:49:30]  Opie and Anthony  who decided that  Banks was right  for their own brand  of lowbrow  public humiliation  I want her  to see a sign  that says Tyra  is a self-centered  fat pig  yeah  I'll pay  five hundred  dollars  oh  five hundred  dollars  it makes the news  I got another  five hundred  no problem  pay up boys  after issuing  that challenge  to their listeners  one group of fans  calling themselves  the POWs  or Pess Out West  went so far  as to put up  a giant banner  out front of 
[02:50:00]  CBS's LA studio  where Tyra showed  tapes and it read  Tyra Banks  is a fatty pig  fatty  very classy  the insulting  sign has since  been taken down  no word yet  on what Tyra  has to say  about the stunt  I came up with  something years ago  basically it says  with the mouth  well  big  luscious  juicy ones  wow  the swinging  tribute  to unrestrained  female  anatomy  Anthony has 
[02:50:30]  left the studio  there's no key  to the men's room  there's no key  to the men's room  we got a wireless  on him  at least  Anna's left  the studio  he's uh  I don't know  he's uh  he's out there  somewhere  he just got up  like an old man  and just kind of  shuffled across  the studio  and left  and Anthony  is just really
