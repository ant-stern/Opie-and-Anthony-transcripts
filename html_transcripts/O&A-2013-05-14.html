<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between them.  It began with Opie's graphic and profane account of his severe allergy attack and subsequent visit to urgent care, featuring a description of a doctor with exceptionally bad breath.  This segued into a discussion of a recent Star Trek movie screening, with Anthony surprisingly staying awake, a bet being settled, and the film's plot holes and inconsistent reviews being dissected (one publication gave it a scathing 1.5 stars). The possibility of having Zoe Saldana as a guest led to a discussion of her attractiveness and physique.

The show then transitioned to O.J. Simpson's legal troubles and potential parole, tackled with sarcastic and darkly humorous commentary. This was followed by a discussion of Angelina Jolie's double mastectomy, including graphic speculation about the procedure and its potential results, including nipple reconstruction and breast implants.  A planned interview with Jimmy Connors that fell through was briefly mentioned, highlighting the difficulty in securing celebrity guests.

The discussion of Angelina Jolie's surgery continued in a later segment, with the addition of a medical doctor, "Dr. Steve," who provided explicit details about the surgical procedures, including nipple reconstruction techniques.  Dr. Steve also shared a personal anecdote about a friend's suicide stemming from an obsessive relationship. This was interjected with vulgar jokes and commentary on Frank Sinatra's career and Amy Schumer's show, "Inside Amy Schumer."  The segment also included a brief interview with a person in costume and comments on Barbara Walters' retirement and Wendy Williams' show.  Audio clips of a radio host, Frankie Blue, getting drunk on air were played, and the Boston Marathon bombing and its media coverage were briefly discussed.

Earlier in the show, Paula, a seemingly intoxicated female colleague on her last day, had song requests played, leading to a discussion of her potentially disastrous final broadcast which included insulting the Royal Family.  This was interspersed with comedic anecdotes about a *Arthur* remake, a darkly humorous AIDS joke, and further discussion of Paula's final broadcast.  The hosts also promoted their upcoming podcast, detailing its content (archived and new material culminating in a "nugget"), and addressed listener complaints.

O.J. Simpson’s fall from grace and imprisonment remained a recurring theme, interwoven with anecdotes about fights and near-fights at The Cellar comedy club featuring comedians including Charlamagne Tha God, who was a guest on the show. A clip of a newscaster, AJ Clementi, swearing on his first day on air (and now working as a bartender) was played.  The segment also included a discussion of vintage airline commercials featuring attractive flight attendants, contrasting them with modern advertising.  Personal experiences were shared, including Charlamagne’s struggles with a persistent Twitter user and Opie's rejected advances toward a flight attendant.

A later segment featured videos of low-flying fighter jets, prompting strong expletives from the hosts.  They then promoted their "United States of Hip-Hop" show on Fuse, mentioning guests like Chris Rock and Nicole (a co-host of "After Opie and Anthony Live"). Nicole joined the studio, leading to discussions about Martha Stewart's dating life, DJ Red Alert's arrests for soliciting male prostitutes, and Little Wayne's controversies.  Nicole heavily promoted her upcoming show. A negative experience with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's publicist was recounted, along with other past celebrity encounters, including a difficult one with Sidney Poitier. An upcoming podcast was also promoted.

Sam Roberts then hosted the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment, discussing his anxieties about farting during personal training sessions, leading to listener calls and banter.  Little John joined the show afterward, discussing his time on "Celebrity Apprentice," his DJ career, maintaining a successful career while partying, aspects of hip-hop culture, twerking, and his early life experiences.  The impact of the Dave Chappelle skit featuring him and his diamond-encrusted teeth, made by Paul Wall, were also discussed.

Finally, a separate segment featured Little John again, this time focusing on expensive jewelry, his past spending habits, and Trinidad James's music video.  He discussed his participation in *Celebrity Apprentice*, his fundraising efforts, and a humorous anecdote about a friend's preference for strip clubs over charity. He ended by promoting the American Diabetes Association, citing his family’s experiences with diabetes. The hosts thanked Little John and promoted their social media.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  What?  He's dang open-handed, don't listen to the dang open.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Well, thank you, Mr. Shatner.  Ah. 
[00:01:00]  Hello, Bill.  Yes.  Good morning, Bill.  Ah, hi, everybody.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Here we go.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  What is it, Thursday, Friday?  What is it?  I believe it's, yeah, Thursday.  Oh, God.  Thursday.  It's tomorrow, Friday.  Everybody's like, what?  What is this?  Where do they go?  Are they in Best Of?  It's only Tuesday.  Hey, damn it.  What's my motherfucking shit? 
[00:01:30]  Fuck.  Oh, shit.  Fucking.  Fuck.  Fucking.  Ha ha.  Well.  My body's trying to kill me again.  What happened now?  What happened is I get fucking allergies.  Oh, shit.  You know, we joke about it.  I'm bubble boy.  Yeah.  And it's the bubble boy time of year.  You do get those allergies.  So I got, I got some Nasonex.  I got some Vizine allergy relief. 
[00:02:00]  I took a Claritin.  Oh.  And I took a Singulair.  Are you Claritin clear?  And I took some Afrin last night so I could sleep two hours.  I used to wear an Afrin.  Fuck.  Hair was all curly.  Yeah.  Fucking Afro.  Bravo.  Fucking.  I'm suffering from allergies and you're fucking making a goddamn joke.  Horrible hair joke.  Why don't you fucking get allergies?  I don't know.  I blow my schnozola and that's it. 
[00:02:30]  I wish everyone could enjoy seasonal allergies and what it does to you.  Every so often I get that feeling like, you know, the back of your, the inside of your  face itches.  Yeah.  Oh, every once in a while you get that.  Every once in a while and then I sneeze a few times because, and, and that's if like  that whole yellowy mist is laying on everything outside.  Oh, really?  Just every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Last night I was trying to itch my own teeth out of my fucking skull.  That sounds frustrating.  Holy fuck. 
[00:03:00]  I slept three hours.  Oh.  And if I didn't take a day last week, I would have taken today.  Taking the day?  Did you run through it this morning again?  How do I?  Oh, of course I did.  Maybe if I call.  It was, it was, it was so bad I couldn't, uh, join you guys for Star Trek.  Oh, is that why?  Dude, I was, I was so bad I went to that goddamn, uh, uh, urgent care to see what else I could  fucking do for my allergies.  It's like, you know, they're popping up all over the place on the easy way.  Is it like a free clinic or something?  Yeah, they're kind of, nah, they're, they're better than free clinics. 
[00:03:30]  Like that fucking Pennsylvania abortion clinic guy?  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  Well, they're brand new, uh, very clean and they get right to you.  Do you need insurance?  Uh, yeah, they, they take your insurance.  I had a bail on the stupid Russian doctor.  I don't like her anymore, so.  Well, fortunately, uh, your seat was great for, uh, that big tub of popcorn.  Oh, really?  Left there.  Yeah, I had a nice buffer seat.  Really?  I gave Roland enough time so maybe he could invite somebody else to the Star Trek screening. 
[00:04:00]  He didn't care.  He just fucking.  Really?  He loves things like saving seats.  I know.  And so then as I'm talking to the doctor just really fast, he had the worst fucking breath  I've ever smelled in my life.  I don't know what the fuck was rotting in his mouth.  Doctor on call breath.  And I could smell it through, uh, uh, an incredibly stuffy nose.  So you can imagine how bad it was.  All right, you're there for an allergy.  You think you'd be safe with a fucking stuffed nose?  You had flu breath?  It was horrendous. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  What is he, licking cadaver assholes during lunchtime?  Holy, what?  And you're working with the public.  Why?  It's mind boggling.  Why?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  I'm not getting close to anyone today because I'm assuming with all the phlegm and the snot  and all the shit going on, I might have, you know, something going on with my fucking  breath today.  This guy's right in my fucking face, checking everything out.  I'm like, oh my God.  Did he, uh, did he hook you up with anything? 
[00:05:00]  Just that.  Just, what is it?  OTC.  With seasonal allergies, you just got to fucking, you know, try a whole bunch of different  shit and, and, and, and figure out what combo works for you.  Yeah.  Because some, for some people, Allegro works better than Claritin, where you might need  some Zizol, actually.  That might help.  I'm not really sure, though, but try the Nasonex.  Jesus.  And at night, if you can't sleep, try the Afrin, but if you, if you do more than three 
[00:05:30]  puffs of Afrin, you'll be addicted for life.  So be careful with that shit.  I know.  There's, why, why do they even offer Afrin if, if, if, if I think it's four days.  If you use Afrin for four days, you will be addicted.  I, I used to have to go through some kind of rehab program during, during that, that  bad, uh, cold I had, I used, I used Afrin every day for probably good seven, eight days.  All right.  So you got addicted to it.  No, it, it worked amazingly.  It was great. 
[00:06:00]  Oh yeah.  And then once my nose cleared up, I fucking put it back in the medicine cabinet, but everybody  was warning, like the warnings you get from all these people, look out, it's worse than  heroin.  Well, how stupid is your nose that after a couple puffs, it's addicted to it?  Addicted.  And then, then the nose can't go, can't go back to normal.  It worked perfectly.  And then it was done and it's back in the medicine cabinet.  It's unbelievable enough with your warnings. 
[00:06:30]  Afrin kills me too, man.  If I use it one night, cause it shrinks your, uh, those things in your nose, right?  The, uh, the turbinate boogers.  No, no, no, it makes the turbinate shrink.  So the air goes around them, the turbinate.  And they, they swell back up the next day and it's worse.  You need it again.  Yeah.  So you do it again and they shrink and they, and then fucking by day three, you're finished.  Really?  I had no problem with it.  I loved the, the stuff loved it.  Killed it for you.  I might need a suit effect.  Cause then they're like, if you get really bad, then, you know, you might want  to throw a Sudafed in there as well. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Fuck.  It's the worst dude.  And I was, I was doing well.  I thought I was skating this fucking season.  Well, I got hit bad.  This is a, it's a bad time.  We had a lot of, uh, sun, uh, and, uh, and then we had, uh, not much rain.  Right.  And then of late, we had some rain, which made all those little things bloom and blossom  and on the, all the shit falls out of them.  Oh, and then to make it really much worse, uh, the wind decided to kick up for two days. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  That was bad.  That's horrendous for people like me.  I want to do some voiceovers today.  I think I got that deep voice.  I finally got the voice.  So gritty like Sam Roberts, like six, six Sam Roberts.  I bet you they would like me on entertainment weekly because I got the voice, Sam, unlike  yourself.  True.  You still sounded like a little faggot.  Why would you say that?  It's unnecessary.  I know.  And while I have the stage, I also wanted to say quickly, fuck you, Time Warner. 
[00:08:00]  Cable?  Dude, there was an amazing, uh, uh, hockey game going on last night.  You had the Rangers and the Capitals.  The Rangers kicked the Capitals' ass, five zip, and they, they, they move on.  And then the Bruins game, that game was over.  And I see everyone on Twitter, like, like basically, uh, you know, pleading to the gods.  I'll give up my first son if you, if, if you could get the Bruins to come back in this  game.  It was, it was kind of cool to watch.  Yeah.  Because they were desperate.  One guy said, I'll wear pink for a year if my Bruins could come back in this game. 
[00:08:30]  They were down by three, was it?  Three goals, I guess.  And then, you know, I, uh, you know, uh, Twitter exploded.  So I'm like, well, fuck, I gotta watch this fucking game.  I can't find it on Time Warner.  What?  I don't know where it was.  You gotta Google Bruins game Time Warner cable.  Sometimes on the fire side I do that, and that's how I find a channel.  How about you just search the Time Warner?  Well, how can you look at it?  They have a search feature, so I'm like, alright, uh, hockey.  Nope.  NHL hockey.  Nope.  Playoff hockey. 
[00:09:00]  Nope.  Boston Bruins.  Nope.  Nothing comes up.  And they had the Rangers game on, uh, two fucking channels.  I couldn't find it.  Wow.  And then Travis said it was on CNBC.  Oh, okay, that makes sense.  CNBC.  Isn't that like, no one watches CNBC.  What is this?  Isn't that like the stock channel?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Isn't it?  I think so.  Huh?  It's right behind you.  It was on this? 
[00:09:30]  There it is, yeah.  It's the morning, like, stock channel.  With that fucking guy that yells and screams?  Kramer?  Kramer.  So, I don't know.  I heard it was amazing.  The Bruins ended up scoring, like, two goals in the last 90 seconds to force overtime.  Who won?  You know how insane that is?  They won, yeah.  The Bruins end up winning.  And they move on.  Overtime goal.  So, Boston is out of their minds today.  One of the greatest comebacks in hockey.  Ever?  Yeah, that was huge.  Ever?  Game seven?  Down two goals with 90 seconds left or something like that? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, you scored the two goals.  Pretty huge.  Anyway.  And your Rangers are still in it there, Rope.  Ah, fuck you.  I don't do that.  You don't do that shit.  I don't do that.  I'll bandwagon.  I'll bandwagon for the Rangers.  Yeah, but you're not really an Islanders fan.  Nah, I'm not really a hockey fan.  No, I'm going Bruins.  But once that state of yours gets in there, you gotta woo-rah-rah.  Nope.  We spent time in Boston.  That's good enough.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm not even joking, man.  I don't go Rangers. 
[00:10:30]  You're not frontin'?  Nope.  Damn.  If the Islanders left the NHL, and then I would have to give it a year or two, then I probably  would end up becoming a Rangers fan.  Rangers fan.  I would have to have a little buffer.  But the Islanders would have to be out of the league.  Lots of buffers.  Whatever.  How was Star Trek, man?  Oh, well, I walk in, and Roland is standing guard over the seats that are dead center in  the theater.  Nice.  And I mean from side to side, front to back. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Dead center in the big IMAX theater.  Good for him.  Yeah.  And he's just, he's standing like a guard.  Right.  And, um...  Did you see him shoo anyone away?  No, unfortunately, I didn't get to see that.  But I sat down, and he said that you weren't showing up, I guess.  Yeah, I told you.  So I had a great buffer seat next to me for the popcorn.  And, uh, he did stay awake. 
[00:11:30]  No way.  Yeah, he did.  Do I have to take your word for it?  How close were you to him?  I was a few people over.  He kept looking, though, for me.  Yeah, and everybody else was watching him.  I owe Roland $100.  Other people there, and we would have absolutely seen him fall asleep.  Are you serious?  I'm not kidding.  I've never seen him stay awake for a whole movie.  I wish I could have.  He drank coffee, he ate popcorn.  Oh, see, that's why. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, he was like, he's like, I'm not losing this one.  That's why.  He made a point of not losing it.  But Roland is very competitive.  He is.  Fuck, that's why.  Because I'm like, there's no way he's going to stay awake.  But, of course, he, you know, he made sure.  He's eating.  He's fucking popcorn.  Slapping his face.  Oh, he just.  Pinching his fucking face.  Yeah, yeah.  He stayed awake, really?  Yeah, he did.  I owe him $100. 
[00:12:30]  Fucking dollars.  Well, no spoilers, don't worry.  I'm not going to fucking spoil anything.  This Star Trek, let's see, not as good as the first one, but that would be very hard  to do because the first one's the first one of the new Star Trek thing, so it had that  going for it and stuff.  A lot of plot holes.  Really?  A lot of plot holes.  In what way?  You'll be watching and go like, why?  Why didn't they just do this? 
[00:13:00]  Why?  Why?  Why are they doing that?  Could he give us one, maybe?  That doesn't.  There are some technical plot holes, like why the fuck would they use the shuttlecraft  and not the transporter?  Like, that came up quite a few times in this movie.  Like, what the fuck?  Like, the transporter would be perfect for that.  You're endangering yourself and everybody else, and the movie starts with a scene where 
[00:13:30]  you're like, the transporter would have, you would have used the transporter.  You beam that fucking down, and you're fine.  Yeah, but that doesn't make for an exciting movie.  Exactly, but it kind of takes away from, you know.  You kind of have to bounce that shit out again.  That's exactly it.  But do they explain why they can't, do they give a reason?  Like, I wish we could use a transporter, but a couple of times they do.  It just always seems like they can't lock on this, that.  It's like, I have seen episodes of Star Trek and in the movies where they fucking are beaming 
[00:14:00]  like mad, mad.  I'm beaming up, I'm beaming down.  I'm beaming, Naughton.  And, uh, yeah, it's just, uh, you know, but that's, that's kind of a geeky technical thing.  There are a few geek things that, yeah, don't make much sense, uh, and then there's just  a couple of major storyline things that are like, don't make sense.  Right.  Like, why would they do that when they could just do this kind of a thing? 
[00:14:30]  Uh, it looks fucking amazing.  As a Star Trek fan, you'll sit there, especially the IMAX 3D.  Holy fuck.  Holy fuck do they got that shit figured out.  Is that the first time you've been to the IMAX 3D?  No, no, I saw, uh, Prometheus there.  Oh, okay.  You get those big-ass 3D glasses.  They're giant.  You look like fucking dice.  I know, they're getting bigger and bigger, man.  They're big because the screen's so huge, you know, it was, you, you, you, the leaking  out from the bottom and top, so now they just throw these giant 3D glasses on your face. 
[00:15:00]  The strange thing about IMAX 3D, you don't really need to get the nice seat like you had.  No, no.  For the most part, every seat is perfect.  Yeah.  Because of that technology.  Yep.  I mean, I guess you want to be old school and make sure you get a good seat, but it almost  doesn't matter.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure maybe way on the sides or something.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe, but I'm not even sure.  I've never sat way on the sides, though, so right in the middle.  Because I had a shitty seat from one of the screenings. 
[00:15:30]  It still looked good.  And I was bummed out, but I was, yeah, it was right in front of me.  Yeah.  Everything was like fucking centered perfectly.  That IMAX shit is amazing, too, because you'll be watching the movie, and it's on that  fucking giant screen.  Right.  And then during dialogue portions of the movie and most of the other parts, it's at a certain  ratio, height to width ratio.  I don't know what it is with IMAX.  It's giant.  And then when the big scenes come up, the big action scenes, those space battles and  things like that, the whole screen gets used. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  So it's weird.  They almost have like a letterboxed thing going on for most of the film.  And then it opens up for the big scenes.  Right, right.  And you get this fucking giant...  The feeling of moving and falling and shit that you get during some of these scenes and  these overhead views of the spaceports and the ships and things, you feel like you're teetering  on the edge of something.  That's awesome.  It's so cool.  Do you want to do that on purpose, the filming of it differently? 
[00:16:30]  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So all of a sudden it's full.  It's like...  Yeah, yeah.  It must.  Do you take your glasses off and go, oh wow, I'm under water now.  I can't see anything.  I can't see shit.  Yeah, it's that little blurry thing going on.  So it looks amazing.  J.J. Abrams knows how to film those big epic scenes.  They just fucking...  And he knows how to get the emotion out of you with some of these big scenes.  Like the camera swing to expose the giant enterprise right at the screen and then the 
[00:17:00]  da, da, da, the music coming in.  It's just fucking...  Any surprises?  Incredible.  If you really go in not knowing what's going to happen or anything, then you'll have a  few surprises.  Yeah.  Yeah, a few surprises in there.  Yeah.  Like, oh, oh.  But even that leaves some things to be questioned.  Like, why, why?  And there's a few cheeseball-y moments. 
[00:17:30]  Ah.  Yeah, yeah.  A couple of cheeseball moments.  What's a cheeseball moment?  It's a little cheesy where you're watching and going, ooh.  We've matured, man.  Because the old days, you would have gave the whole movie away right now.  Yeah, yeah, I would have.  Fuck.  Mm-hmm.  I want to know a cheeseball moment.  Uh, it's just one of those moments as a fan, as somebody who's seen all the shows, all  the films, all the everything, you're just kind of like, ugh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Um, but there's a couple of funny parts, too, if you're a huge fan. 
[00:18:00]  Like, uh, and I'll even give one away.  Why not?  You know, the funny moment where you're, uh, I guess Chekov had to go do something in  engineering.  So, uh, Kirk goes, okay, go put on a red shirt and get down to engineering, and he kind  of looks like, oh, fuck, because the red shirt is instant death.  If you're wearing a red shirt in Star Trek, that meant you'd die.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's always the security on the away team.  Oh, that's funny.  They wear the red shirts, and they got the phaser out, and they were always the first  ones to get killed. 
[00:18:30]  So he tells them, you know, all right, put a red shirt on and get down to engineering,  and he kind of looks around like, what?  Uh, I don't want to put a red shirt on.  Oh, that's funny.  Did people get it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Star Trek geeky guys.  And there's a few other good ones, and the banter between, uh, Kirk and Spock.  Right.  Uh, kind of feeling each other out still is pretty funny.  Uh, Bones is great.  He plays such a good Bones, that guy.  How many, how many movies are they going to make?  I don't know.  This fucking franchise can go on and on forever.  Can go for a while, huh? 
[00:19:00]  It's pretty amazing.  They're all young, so they got, as long as, you know, they want to keep doing it.  Right.  Uh, they could do it.  The, the only problem with the visual aspect of it is, uh, J.J. Abrams likes the, his action  scenes use a lot of, like, motion blur and stuff, and, and, and shaky cam.  So with the 3D, that doesn't really work very well, so sometimes your, your eyes get a little  like, ugh.  Right.  Like, it's distracting almost.  Huh.  But for the most part.  I guess it can't be perfect. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  With the technology, right?  Very hard for it to be perfect.  Yeah.  Um, but he did, he did a great job.  Not as much lens flare, which is good.  There's a couple of scenes where I'm like, ooh, that's flary.  But he had to throw it in there.  He's known for it now.  Yeah, throw it in.  Yeah.  Not every fucking thing.  Just all over the screen in that first one.  It was lens flare, lens flare.  Right.  Um, yeah.  Pretty good.  I, I walked out of there liking what I saw.  Um.  You weren't disappointed.  Visually.  Yeah.  You won't be disappointed if you're a Star Trek fan at how it looks. 
[00:20:00]  The characters are all true to, you know, the, the, the characters.  I, I'm reading between the lines.  What was it missing?  I can't say without blowing, like, the story.  Oh, okay.  I can't say.  Like, there's a, a, a.  Oh, you weren't completely disappointed.  A plot line.  No, I wasn't disappointed.  Like, some, I guess some people will be like, they fucking suck.  You know, shit like that.  And, and, and the plot holes do get you kind of like, ah, well, that's why I see.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  But, again, if you're a Star Trek fan, look at every movie and every fucking episode of,  of the next generation and the original series.  There are plot holes in everything.  Nothing's like, oh, good.  Everything figured.  Everything worked the way it was supposed to.  They always leave these fucking plot holes where you're like, why didn't he, why, what?  Right, right.  Who the fuck was that?  Why did that guy do this instead of that?  So, you know, if, if you remember that going into it, just fucking relax and, and, and don't  worry that some things don't quite figure. 
[00:21:00]  More importantly, uh, was Leonard Nimoy in this movie as well?  I, uh, I, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna say yes or no.  Oh, come on.  It messed, it messed you up a lot for the first move.  He could have somehow been in one of the scenes.  Fuck. 
[00:21:30]  Really?  Oh, boy.  That completely ruined his appearance.  Once I realized he was talking over his dentures.  Yeah.  They didn't glue him in better this time.  Oh, boy.  They're still a little loosey-goosey, those things.  Fucking, uh, a little, a little, uh.  Those chiclets are still fucking moving around in his mouth.  Yeah.  A little C-bond would help Leonard.  Really?  Maybe he could open his mouth.  Yeah.  And talk.  Can someone get me the C-bond? 
[00:22:00]  Why, why, why, why does that happen?  I don't know.  It's.  The wish.  The wish hole.  The wish hole.  The wish.  For sure.  Simon Pegg is good as Scotty.  I mean, you know, they're all, all the characters are very, you know, you don't sit there watching  that, that cast and go like, oh, boy, they fucked up in casting this one or that one.  Are we getting any of these guys in?  Oh, it would be nice, wouldn't it? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, that would have been nice, but that ain't happening, right?  Yeah, is the question, would it have been nice or are we getting them in?  Do you hear any scuttlebutt?  Yeah, what's going on, Sam?  Are we getting any?  The answer is yes, it would be nice.  It would be nice.  Whoa.  The answer, uh, the yes answer is, it would be nice.  What's the word on the street?  Yeah, to my knowledge, nobody from Star Trek will be in, to my knowledge.  In the building or to see us?  No, to see us.  Oh, that's good.  Who else is in the building?  Uh, is, uh, is Zoe Saldana in that movie? 
[00:23:00]  Uh, yes.  She plays Uhuru, I guess.  Uhuru?  I think she's coming in.  Is she doing this show?  Is she here doing this show?  Wait, so...  She's coming into the building, I think.  So basically our audience isn't going to go see Star Trek.  Wait, what did that one say?  That's her.  That's Zoe Saldana.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, what...  They gave it five stars.  They gave it five stars in the Daily News.  Well, the other paper gave it a star and a half.  Which paper?  The post.  The post.  A star and a half?  Yeah.  Now, that's fucking ridiculous. 
[00:23:30]  I think.  You know what?  What does it say there, Mars?  You wouldn't get two stars alone if you turned the fucking sound off.  I think that's what I saw.  That's crazy.  Star and a half!  Star and a half.  So there's a discrepancy here between the two New York papers.  No, that's somebody reviewing that just doesn't like the genre, perhaps, or doesn't like the  fucking...  There's a problem there, a personal problem.  You could just watch it for the action alone, for the way it looks, for the CGI, and it gets  two stars at least. 
[00:24:00]  Can I read the first paragraph?  Please.  It says, why would a Starfleet admiral ask a 300-year-old frozen man for help, asked  Captain Kirk, in his latest adventure?  That's a spoiler right there.  Well, that's how they start the review!  I guess you're not supposed to read the reviews.  I asked you if I could read the first paragraph.  I didn't read it.  I don't know what it was.  But you said yes!  I didn't assume they would fucking put a spoiler in the first fucking paragraph.  Wow.  Jesus.  I apologize. 
[00:24:30]  All right, I won't read any further.  No, I wouldn't do that.  So what time is she here tomorrow?  She is not here tomorrow.  She is in on Thursday.  You know what sucks, though?  Then these people will come through again for a really shitty movie.  Right, right.  And then they'll...  And then I'll just want to talk to them about Star Trek, and they'll keep bringing up their  new shitty movie.  Right, and then they'll want to be on our show.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, no, the new film I'm doing called Petals for Rosalie.  Right.  It's about a woman who has breast cancer and a dream and decides to buy a hat. 
[00:25:00]  Boo!  And then people tell us that you're, you know, you're building relationships.  No.  No, we're not.  No.  We're not.  It doesn't matter in the end.  What one is she in?  She's in at 1010.  Oh, well.  So she's here at 1010, and we can't get her on Thursday?  Yeah, no.  She's doing Al Q, Shade 45, Hits 1, and La Mescla.  That's nice.  Thanks.  What's La Mescla?  Cla. 
[00:25:30]  You think they're fucking Star Trek fans over there, aren't Shade?  You honestly think they're Star Trek fans?  Like I like Star Trek.  Yeah, you know that show, Star Trek?  Oh, God.  Oh, also J.J. Abrams took a lot of liberties with that timeline, alternate timeline shit  from the first movie.  Right, right, right.  You know where that guy came through and fucking fucked up the whole timeline so that J.J.  Abrams brilliantly figured out how to make brand new stories for the crew.  Right, right.  He takes some liberties now where you're like, Jesus Christ. 
[00:26:00]  He's just making it his own, I guess.  People have fucking English accents.  You don't know how they got them.  It's like, what the fuck is that?  You think in the future, all accents would be kind of one.  They do show like London of the future and that and San Francisco of the future.  It's pretty fucking, yeah, it's pretty cool.  Yes.  Pretty fucking cool.  We had nobody from fucking Star Trek on the show.  It is amazing.  It's one of the biggest films of the summer. 
[00:26:30]  We've been building relationships, though, for years.  We didn't say no to her, right?  No, we have Anthony Cumia in studio to promote Star Trek.  Yes, I'm promoting Star Trek.  It's my new project that is coming out.  We're very proud of it.  Yes.  I don't know.  You guys tell me.  Did you say no to her?  I don't believe so, no.  We would never say no.  I don't think we'd say no to her.  I don't know at all from Star Trek.  Not to Uhura.  She actually is an attractive black woman, in my opinion.  Whoa!  Whoa! 
[00:27:00]  She's actually an attractive black woman.  She should come on just for that alone.  Yeah.  You know why?  She's got a very attractive body on her that doesn't seem like your typical, you know,  a little, she doesn't have a lot of back.  And she's not too dark, and she doesn't have chopped meat hair.  Not chopped meat hair.  Right.  Well, she's not black.  She's Dominican and Puerto Rican.  What?  That's black.  Is she?  It's not black at all.  Mars, that's black, right?  It's not black at all!  That's black, right, Mars?  She looks black, but... 
[00:27:30]  Dominican, right?  Dominican's not black.  But she's a little black, right?  Mars knows.  You know what's good?  She doesn't have that fucking ass.  God damn it, Mars.  She doesn't have that fucking, that fucking horrid ass.  Dominican asses are nice, dude.  Twerking ass.  They're up a little high.  Yeah, they're really, really nice.  They're up a little high.  She looks good.  How do we...  It's fucking so annoying to me.  We get nobody...  I don't even give a fuck about the movie.  We get nobody from the movie in the...  Oh, don't be annoyed.  It'll just eat...  Look at that, huh?  Nice, right? 
[00:28:00]  I feel better that she's not black.  Do you?  Yeah, a little bit.  You were confused by your feelings?  I was getting very confused about my feelings.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wow, look at that ass.  I would have to punch my penis and yell racial epithets.  I'd like to do that to your penis anyway.  How does the spine curve like that?  Look at that.  My God, man.  Anyway.  That's as close as you're going to get to her.  Oh, shit.  Enjoy these photos. 
[00:28:30]  What else will be over at Shade?  What do you think?  Should we have some of the Star Trek people on our show?  I would think it'd be a good look.  Yeah, I think so, too.  You know, it's a big show.  Star Trek's kind of the movie of the moment.  Yeah.  Radio Wizard asked me what kind of rug I want in here.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to clean one.  Yeah, he said the old rug's dirty.  So, he was asking me what kind of rug I want.  I don't know.  I'm going to get a fucking rug.  Could you suggest one for him?  All day.  Should you get a bear skin rug? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Tell him you want a real bear skin rug with a head on it and everything.  That'd be cool.  That would be fucking kick-ass.  Or we could make a rug out of the Radio Wizard.  Oh, man.  I'll find out.  Split out.  So, what's going on with the OJ?  He's on the front page of our papers.  I can't fucking get enough of OJ.  I love the OJ.  Oh, man.  Is he the greatest murderer of all time?  He walks into a courtroom with that look on his face. 
[00:29:30]  He's always smiling.  And he looks around the courtroom like, what am I doing here?  Like, there's been some 20-year-old grave error that's been going on this entire time.  He's still surprised walking into a courtroom.  He smiles.  He looks at the bailiff and everybody in the lobby.  And he's like, well, this room's nice.  What is this used for?  I think he has the memory of a goldfish.  Yes.  Is the problem here.  Yeah.  I don't even think he knows he's been in prison for, what is it, four years already? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, probably four or five years.  Four or five years.  And, you know, they're beating the shit out of him because he looks puffy and a bit overweight.  His face is getting multicolored, too.  He's getting, like, raccoon-y eyes.  Look.  Right.  See?  He's got, like, raccoon eyes.  Right.  And then it's darker on his forehead and his jawline, and then it lightens up on his cheeks a little.  He's still smiling, though.  I'm smiling.  The OJ's still smiling.  He's still smiling.  But, you know, the paper is, you know, they're showing a picture from 1995. 
[00:30:30]  Of course he's not going to look like he did in 1995.  No one is going to look like they did in 1995.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, really.  I thought he looked all right.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hello.  Am I, is this, is this an autograph signing?  Right.  Bring everybody in.  I'll sign it.  No, OJ.  You're on, you're in court.  Right.  You're fucking, you're doing time for fucking assault, kidnapping, fucking robbery.  He thought it would be a good idea to just fucking, what, strong arm some, some dude in Vegas. 
[00:31:00]  Now his case, I guess, is that he's saying his lawyer was incompetent or bad lawyer, gave  him bad advice.  Didn't give him the plea bargain deal.  Didn't give him the plea bargain deal.  I think that's what it's about.  That would have gotten him three years, I guess.  Yeah, he would have been done.  He'd have been done.  So he's basically arguing that my lawyer never explained the plea bargain.  Explained the plea bargain.  He beat double life.  How do you fucking steal a Heisman when you almost lopped a real head off? 
[00:31:30]  Keep it quiet for the rest of your life.  You won.  No kidding, man.  Ixnay on the erder, May.  Dude, you fucking, it was a double niter.  Yeah, yeah.  You got, you got through.  You danced out of court in the biggest obvious case in history.  Right.  And he's not even eligible for parole until 2017, I believe.  So if this doesn't work, he's got another three, four years.  How much time did he get?  I can't really throw the book out of it.  Nine to something, I think.  Eligible for parole in 2017. 
[00:32:00]  He's also...  Can you look that up?  That might be wrong.  I think you're right.  2017, was it?  I know he's got a few years left before possible parole.  His lawyer didn't give him the proper advice on the plea bargain.  Didn't talk to him about the plea bargain.  Also, his lawyer had told him previously that he could go in and get his goods back.  Right.  As long as there was no strong-arming or anything. 
[00:32:30]  But how else are you going to do it?  OJ.  How about you hire someone to do it?  How about you give someone a piece where you give them a couple grand and you insulate yourself?  Yeah.  How about you don't walk in?  It's OJ.  Hey, look, it's OJ.  Right.  And other guys with guns.  And they're robbing us.  Who robbed you?  OJ Simpson.  You mean OJ sent people in to rob...  No, no.  It was the guy.  What an idiot.  And he's probably right. 
[00:33:00]  About this, OJ is probably right.  Yeah, but you know what?  You just let it go.  You let it go.  You won.  Oh, what an idiot.  Yeah.  You beat double murder.  I think Al Michaels is still his friend.  Yeah.  I don't think OJ has many friends.  Ow!  Except a few people on the cell block and in the yard.  He's probably quite the celebrity there in the prison.  Oh, they probably love him.  Hey, Juice!  Yo, Juice!  And he waves.  Hey, how you doing?  Right. 
[00:33:30]  How you doing?  Keep moving, OJ.  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, he forgot for a second.  He's in prison.  All right.  Again.  Goes to walk over.  Stay in line, OJ.  Okay, all right.  Sorry, I'll talk to you later in the shower.  Oh, poor Juice.  I don't mind if I sit and eat with you guys.  Hey, Juice!  Yeah, Juice, sit down, man!  I wouldn't say...  That's the Spanish people.  I wouldn't say poor Juice.  I think he's enjoying the hell out of it.  You think he likes it?  I just think he's one of those guys.  Yeah.  What's up today, guys? 
[00:34:00]  He sits down.  Let me tell you about...  No, it was...  So, the call goes down.  And I come running out.  Oh, he's telling all fucking old football stories.  I think there's a lot of laughs and a lot of joking around all day long.  Well, that wasn't really me in the wheelchair when it ejected out onto the field.  See, that was a dummy.  We were laughing, looking at the dailies.  Oh, OJ, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, these days you can't run through an airport.  But for the commercial with the Hertz car, I was running through the airport. 
[00:34:30]  Today with security, though.  Tell us another one, OJ.  You think he's telling the same stories over and over?  Over and over.  Jesus Christ.  But to him, he's telling it for the first time.  Man, if I gotta hear that OJ tell that fucking naked gun story one more motherfucking time...  Fuck that, OJ.  I'm gonna shank the motherfucker.  That's juice.  You can't shank the juice, motherfucker.  What happened to your wife, OJ?  Oh, look at the time.  Gotta go. 
[00:35:00]  Fucking OJ.  There's just something so lovable about the guy.  You gotta love the killer.  It's not the thing to say, but fuck.  Guy's just skipping through life, no matter what life gives him.  I gotta look at him and think, like, I gotta thank the guy for, you know, my position here on the radio.  That's right.  I have that soft spot for him.  That's true.  Jeez.  He doesn't have to worry about losing the weight.  Fred Goldman will just take any extra weight he has.  Oh, boy.  Fred has not let it go. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Boy, does Fred hold a grudge.  Yeah, right?  Lighten up, Fred.  Really, man.  Every time.  Jesus.  Every time Fred takes him to court to get a piece of something, that is Fred resisting the earth to pick up a gun and just kill him in the street.  And kill him, yes.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah.  He's in jail.  Like, it's amazing that they...  What do you think's gonna happen, though?  Sounds like it's a little, um...  I don't know.  A little shady.  No one...  Meaning he might have a shot here. 
[00:36:00]  I don't think so.  I don't think any judge...  Outside shot?  Nothing.  ...is gonna let this guy go.  Everyone knows.  It's just a desperate move, you think?  Yeah.  Everyone knows he killed those people.  So this is...  They couldn't get him on that.  This is society's way of going.  All right, we're square now.  This is...  They couldn't just lock him up for nothing.  He's a dumb motherfucker and actually did something.  And they threw the book at him because of...  If that was the only thing...  Think about this.  That was the only thing O.J. Simpson ever did bad. 
[00:36:30]  Never killed the people.  Had his little career, his commercials, his movies.  And then, on this whim, he's in Vegas and decides to get his shit back.  Right.  Goes in with some strong-armed men.  Right.  Robbs these guys of his shit.  Do you honestly think he'd have gotten this much time in prison?  No.  No way.  He's O.J.  He'd have fucking walked on it.  He'd have gotten probation.  Something.  He'd fucking walked.  The only reason he's doing time is he killed two fucking people.  Do you think he regrets that night?  That one night of rage?  Oh. 
[00:37:00]  Probably not.  Well, I just saw it red.  See, here's the Kaiser Blade.  Some people call it a Sling Blade.  I call it a Kaiser Blade.  Back ever when we come back.  The epic comeback, they're calling it.  The fucking Bruins.  Do we have a party on that?  We can throw the TV on, I guess.  I can't believe it.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So when do they figure out the O.J. thing?  Where's Chris Darden?  No, no, O.J.  This is a different thing.  It's 20 years later. 
[00:37:30]  Where's Marsha Clark?  Ah, those two.  Where's my dream team?  Bumbling idiots.  Where's Johnny Cochran?  Last I heard, he needed an excedrin.  Yeah.  Yeah, he had the old double hat syndrome.  We've talked about when he tried that glove on, even O.J. was surprised.  Like, ooh, it don't fit.  Oh, look.  And then Chris Darden and Marsha Clark are sitting there like, whoa, whoa, it doesn't fit.  Wouldn't you be like, no, try it on properly?  They thought they had. 
[00:38:00]  And then there were rumors that he had a glove, what, a plastic glove on?  He did.  They had the rubber surgical glove.  So why would you go, well, look, we have to take that glove off to make sure this doesn't fit.  But they just let it go.  They're all just in shock.  Like, wow, it really isn't fitting.  He had the rubber surgical glove on and the glove itself because of the blood and the liquid  and that it was in a bag for so long.  It had shrunk up so small because it was leather.  And he wasn't going to stretch it out.  So he puts it on his fingertips.  Right.  And then he's holding his hand up like, look, oh, it doesn't go on. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, he was shocked.  It doesn't go on.  And then Johnny Cochran's like, give me a legal pad.  I got to write a rhyme.  I need to write a rhyme.  Right, right.  The glove doesn't fit.  Doesn't fit.  Doesn't fit.  Acquit.  Acquit.  If the glove don't fit, you must acquit.  That's it.  Not guilty.  But the other dummy's just looking in shock with their mouths open.  Oh, my God.  That probably wasn't the first rhyme he wrote.  It probably was the glove don't fit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  All right. 
[00:39:00]  No, that's not.  Oh, shit.  The glove don't fit.  He didn't cut off a clip.  That's no good.  No, no.  That's the end of the jury.  Now, he had the glove, why?  To cover up evidence?  Is what they were saying?  Yeah, he supposedly was wearing gloves and a wool hat.  If I was going to murder people and I was going to put gloves on, I would find gloves that barely fit.  Wouldn't you?  Why would you wear anything that fit? 
[00:39:30]  It would be extra tight.  I'd be walking around in pants that were too small.  All that shit.  A shirt that's giant.  Gloves that don't fit.  One shoe, one size, one shoe, the other.  Yes, size 14 shoes.  Yeah, exactly.  Them ugly ass Bruno Mali.  A triple XL fucking jacket.  Right.  Why would you wear the stuff that you would normally wear?  A giant fucking Dallas Cowboys fan hat.  Right.  One of those big styrofoam ones.  Of course that's what you would do.  Walk around with that.  I wouldn't find murder gloves that fit perfectly. 
[00:40:00]  I dropped a glove when I hit Kato Kalin's air conditioner.  Amazing.  And that dog started barking.  Oh, there was just, they were just bumbling fools.  That was Darden.  That was just Darden making improv.  He improvised that.  They thought they were going to have a Perry Mason moment where, all right, we need the jury to see the murderer with the actual glove on his hand from the murder.  Totally backfired.  I would have went with a Brady Bunch moment myself with the briefcase.  Dropped the briefcase?  Dropped the briefcase moment. 
[00:40:30]  And OJ would have turned his head and go, I killed him!  Oh, shit, OJ.  You had it.  That ruined Darden's career, man.  Good, it should have.  He stung.  He's never the same.  Marsha Clark stung, too?  Marsha Clark was terrible.  She got a little TV action after that.  A little bit.  But she's gone away, too.  Lancito?  Huh?  Where'd Lancito go?  Lancito disappeared.  I guess he's still on the bench, I think.  Who knows?  Last I heard, I was a What Happened To?  Kato Kaelin, gone, the fucking... 
[00:41:00]  We had Kato on, didn't we?  Yeah, a long time ago, right?  On his phone, right?  No, he came, man.  Mark Furman's on Fox News.  He's a Fox News contributor.  He's on there all the time.  Yeah, but...  Every time I see him, all I think is, hey, it's the guy that said nigger.  Talk to him every day, come into work.  Ah, shit.  Oh, shit.  Fucking Jimmy. 
[00:41:30]  Fucking Toronto's hurting today.  Be nice to Toronto today.  They got ass-fucked.  Oh, boy, did they get ass-fucked last night.  Damn.  I wouldn't know.  I couldn't find the fucking game.  God!  This is just a fucking...  Holy shit.  Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie cut her boobies off.  She fucking got a voluntary double mastectomy.  Well, the latest thing, a lot of women are doing this. 
[00:42:00]  They do the testing, and they can tell what your percentage is of getting breast cancer.  And in her case, it was 87% chance that she was going to get breast cancer.  87%.  Her mom died at the age of 56 from breast cancer.  Jesus.  So she's like, 87%, I got to do this.  And she went in and got them, you know, removed.  Jesus.  But Sharon Osbourne did.  Someone else did that too.  Sharon Osbourne did it too.  You're right.  Did she?  That's right.  She did it.  Yeah, there's this new testing that women are going through. 
[00:42:30]  What's the name too?  That percentage is too high.  They're getting rid of them.  Did Christina Applegate have it though?  Or did she have breast cancer?  I think she did in one, but she had both removed.  Yeah.  Just in case.  I read a little bit on the way in.  I felt so bad.  I was like, fucking women, man.  They have to worry about that.  Right.  For men, it's very rare, but 87%.  Yeah, an 87% chance.  They could tell on a genetic level what your predisposition is to getting it.  Yep.  Based on family history and the genetic test that they did.  Her number was way too high to take the chance. 
[00:43:00]  Way up there?  She's only 37, I think they said this morning.  37-ish.  I thought she was older than that.  She's been around forever.  Yeah.  You know, it's got to get to the point where they can fucking detect it on a genetic level  and then treat it on a genetic level instead of...  Before it becomes something.  It seems very archaic to just fucking cut off parts of your body based on genetic testing,  but they will one day be able to figure out on a genetic level to fix that. 
[00:43:30]  Wow!  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  By 2030, Ray Kurzweil says.  2029, he says the DNA will be mapped.  Ray's timeline is off.  Maybe, but I think...  Ray's timeline is off because Ray wants to be around for all this stuff.  Yeah.  He's not going to make it.  Yeah, he's getting older.  He was a bore, but man, was that documentary interesting of his.  But a guy that smart has to be boring.  Was today we were supposed to get Jimmy Connors? 
[00:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  What happened with that?  We wanted Jimmy Connors.  We said yes to Jimmy Connors.  He's on Fox News right now.  A guy from fucking Goodfellas?  There you go.  He's talking about gambling and OCD.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy Connors got the OCD.  I guess.  Gambling addiction?  We're not talking to him.  What happened?  Yeah, what happened there, Sam?  What happened?  I know he was definitely pitched.  He was spoken about.  Why are we behaving if it's not getting us anywhere? 
[00:44:30]  Well, you've only been...  Yes.  I started behaving with guests because I thought it would get us somewhere.  I'm turning down a lot of guests these days to Roland.  He'll be like...  And I feel bad because I love Roland and stuff, and I know it's his job,  but there are some guests where I'm just like, no, I have no interest in that person.  It's Roland's fault.  The company should be, you know, pushing the agenda.  But it's like, if you want us to accept guests, let's get...  We've had J.J. Abrams on a bunch of times.  There was no reason why he couldn't stop by yesterday after Howard's interview. 
[00:45:00]  They threw him out of Stern early to get fucking Rod Stewart in there.  And they got some policy that the company's allowing to happen,  even though we all work for the same company.  And the company, here's what they could do.  Push back and say, if you do stuff like that,  then we're not going to have you on any other channels.  But they won't do it.  Because they'll say, how is it our fault?  That's how.  The only way to push back is to say, okay, if you do that,  then you get...  If you refuse to go on certain shows because you're doing one... 
[00:45:30]  They won't do that.  We can't have any loyalty to these guys.  Because they forget about us.  For what it's worth.  I've always had great interviews with J.J. Abrams.  None.  Zero for these performers.  Zero.  And the first time they do it, they should never come back in.  Ever.  Huey Lewis was in here the other day and said he loves you guys.  Yeah, why don't we get Huey?  I kind of wanted him.  He was in at like 1 o'clock in the hour.  Yeah, I like Huey Lewis a lot.  That's different.  We had a great time with him.  You see the power of love.  You did a good job with him, though. 
[00:46:00]  I love Huey.  Yeah, I don't know why he wouldn't come in the morning, though.  Because he's a raging alcoholic.  Could be.  Is he?  Yeah, he drinks a lot and he can't get up in the morning.  Huey drinks?  Yeah, a lot.  Does he?  Giant penis.  And he has a giant penis.  Ah, who doesn't love this music?  That's how he gets free drinks.  How a lot.  He just shows off his giant penis.  Back to the future.  Did you talk to him about his giant penis?  Yes, I did.  How big is it these days?  He didn't give me a number, but he said it's enormous.  He did, right?  He did. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, he likes bragging about his giant penis.  Yeah.  You could see it in his pants.  You looked, huh?  Yes, I did.  Is it gay?  Did you look?  No, not at all.  Oh, all right.  Just checking.  Because I read a rumor that it was big and then I looked at his bulge and it was big.  Hey, Huey, what's the news?  Right.  The big cock.  Yeah, I got a big dick.  Yeah, I got a big dick.  Right.  That's the news.  Right.  What a great reputation to have.  Oh, man.  He's a giant cock.  I'd love to be known as that.  Yeah.  Okay.  So if you get a double mastectomy, do they put implants in there? 
[00:47:00]  I guess it's a whole surgical procedure she's been having done since April, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  And I, yeah, I think they do.  They do.  Because women love their boobies, right?  Yeah.  They do the removal.  They do the plastic surgery on there, you know.  They put something in there?  Yeah.  In most cases?  They create a nipple.  What do you mean?  Nipple.  They create a new nipple?  I think in some cases.  Wait, you have to take the nipple, too? 
[00:47:30]  I think so.  There's like glands.  Whoa.  There's glands in there and shit.  Wait, who knows this shit?  So in some cases, they take the nipple and they tattoo one on or they take some skin from  somewhere and do this twisty thing.  How the fuck do you know this?  I've seen fucking TV shows.  Oh, wow.  You've seen, I want to see fake nipples.  Medical shows.  I didn't know the nipples went, too, though.  Google fake nipples.  It all depends on where those, where glands are, certain glands.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, I did not know that. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know everything.  Like I said, I know a little bit about a lot of things.  I don't know everything.  I thought they just kind of, you know, kind of, you know.  They just, what, kind of leave the, ow, god damn it, that's disgusting.  I don't want to look at this.  Let's look at the fake nips.  Yeah, but that fake, those are fake nips for, like, women to just put on, you know, over  their bra so they look like they're nipping out on the red carpet.  Surgically, they kind of make them, yeah.  Why is Paul McCartney showing up in the fake nipple Google search? 
[00:48:30]  He's got fake nipples.  He does.  Did not know that.  Yes, he does.  Eesh.  God.  Yeah, I guess if you got some cash, they could probably build you some pretty good titties  there, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Do that.  If not, you got to go with the fucking, you know.  Brad was probably in the operating room.  Bigger.  Oh, my gosh.  Make him bigger.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, uh-oh.  You think Brad's going to hang in there? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Because they probably can make him look exactly like her old tits.  I bet not.  You don't think so?  I don't think they can exactly.  I bet.  Frankenstein-ish.  There's a lot of scarring.  Oh.  I bet that size-wise it's different, I bet.  If she had 36 Ds or whatever, you don't think they could just go in there?  I figured they'd just take out everything and then just put it in an implant.  That's a lot of skin to remove.  And, you know, I don't think so.  I don't know, but I don't think so. 
[00:49:30]  We're going to wake up Dr. Steve and we'll ask him all the questions after the break.  Ah, ah, ah.  Yeah.  We'll eat first.  We'll talk to Dr. Steve next.  Yes, let's see.  We've got Barbara Walters announcing.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, Jesus.  What movie is that from?  Original Sin.  Oh, my God.  Look at that wonderful fucking villainous tit.  It's amazing that didn't leak since April that's been happening that no one said a fucking word.  I guess medical confidentiality.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, look at her.  Oh, look what's going on here.  Holy shit.  They're things of beauty.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Angelina Jolie's got beautiful tits in that movie.  Mr. Skin rules.  Thank you, Mr. Skin.  They're not huge, though, right?  What are they, like, they're C's.  No, no, she doesn't have giant, giant ones.  Probably nice full C's.  That's, wow.  Who's this guy?  That's Antonio Banderas.  Antonio Banderas.  He's fucking going.  Antonio Banderas walks around with, who's he married? 
[00:50:30]  Meg Griffin?  No, Meg fucking, what's her name?  Ryan.  Huh?  Meg Ryan.  Meg Ryan.  They walk around the Upper West Side all the time.  He's with Meg Ryan?  They've been together forever, man.  I am?  I see them a lot.  I thought he was with, uh...  The Redhead.  Melanie...  Melanie Griffin.  Melanie Griffin.  Melanie Griffin.  Okay, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not Meg Ryan.  Of course not Meg Ryan.  I've never seen any of them in our neighborhood.  I've never seen a celebrity walk around.  You've got to start looking around.  I just don't.  We've got a lot of celebrities walking around. 
[00:51:00]  Wow, he's fucking her.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa.  Cheeks.  Yo, Dr. Steve.  Hey, man.  Oh.  Whoa, look at him flopping.  Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Doc.  Yeah.  Angelina Jolie.  Double, voluntary double mastectomy.  Yeah.  When they rebuild...  Let's get right to the point here.  When they rebuild...  Yeah.  After the surgery to remove the breasts, what do they do?  What do they look like?  What about the nipple? 
[00:51:30]  Is it comparable to what it was before?  And give us a little line on what Brad Pitt is to expect when he takes her shirt off.  Well, it depends on the surgeon.  And some surgeons do, let's just say, better than others.  Let's just say it's...  Yeah, Angelina Jolie.  Yeah, she's going to get the best.  She's going to get the best in the biz, right?  She's going to be able to afford the best.  Yeah.  And there is a...  And it depends on how they did the mastectomy. 
[00:52:00]  Okay, so there's a way that you can do the mastectomy, that you can get a better reconstruction.  I'm assuming she also had the best job there as well.  There's a guy in Atlanta that does mastectomies and reconstructions.  And the tits that he makes are, you know, are jerkable.  Dude, do you ever slow down with the official medical talk? 
[00:52:30]  You're losing some of the listeners.  Yeah, no kidding.  You can plop your cock between them right after.  Thanks, Doc.  Do you like a jerkable breast?  I mean, it really looks good.  So this can be done in a way that ends up looking reasonably natural.  Okay.  And, you know, particularly with your clothes on, you can look really good.  But done properly, you can look good with your clothes off as well.  Uh-huh.  And what about the nipple?  I never knew that they replaced the nipple.  They created nipples sometimes. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  And that's because you could get the cancer just from nipples?  Well, they want to remove the whole functioning part of the breast, including the ducts, because  the ducts is where the breast can move.  So they remove the nipples every time?  Yeah.  If you're going to do a mastectomy.  I swear I didn't know that until just now.  And how do they reconstruct new nipples?  Because Ant was talking about twisty shit.  Yeah, they take some skin and they twist it to make it, like, look like a nipple. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Yep, what you do is you can tattoo the areola on, and then to make the actual nipple, this  pointy-outy part, they'll make a little cross incision, and then, and exactly right, they'll  twist it, and they'll sew it back with the edges kind of opposed to each other, and it  makes a little pointy-outy thing.  Does it look good?  Yeah, I mean, it can look really good. 
[00:54:00]  But it just, again, it just depends on, you know, I could give you this guy's name off  the air that does this stuff, and you can look at some of his pictures.  But, you know, reconstruction can be done very aesthetically and look really good.  Now, why has she been having this done since April?  Like, how, it's already, whatever month, it, oh, April, this is only a month ago.  Okay, I'm thinking it's been a year.  All right, it's been two months.  Okay, so, yeah, one of the things that they'll have to do is they'll have to expand the skin, 
[00:54:30]  because when you do the mastectomy, it's just like a dude's chest at the end, you know,  it's just flat, and to have breasts, you don't want to just, you know, insert implants under the skin.  It'll just look funny.  So what they'll do is they'll put expanders under the skin, and those are, they're like balloons,  and you'll inflate them a little bit every day or every week,  and the skin will start to grow around them, and it'll give you a little space to put some implants in so that it looks good. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, is that how that works?  Oh, that's crazy.  Is this so you just don't go home with all of a sudden, like, no breasts at all and just skin?  So it's kind of, you're making it bigger first?  Right, what they'll, right, exactly.  So they'll put these expanders under the skin, and the skin will, you know, under that tension will grow around those expanders and stretch.  And it'll look a lot more natural than if you just crammed, you know, a couple of implants under, you know, not enough skin. 
[00:55:30]  So how do they go in?  Do they go in through the armpit?  Do they just take, going right through the nipple?  How do they go in to make, like, less scarring?  Yeah, they can do it under the armpit, or they can do it under the scar.  I mean, to take the tissue out, the breast tissue out.  There's this technique where they do a flap of muscle from the back tissue,  and that's what this guy in Atlanta I was telling you about does.  And apparently that gives you a really natural look. 
[00:56:00]  More importantly, why would you tell the world you're going through this?  Well, I mean, you know.  Why wouldn't you just.  Angelina is an activist, and so, you know.  Yeah, I guess you want to try to help other women.  Sure, absolutely.  I get it.  You know, five to ten percent of breast cancer is thought to be hereditary,  but if you have the breast cancer gene,  it almost is a fait accompli that you're going to get breast cancer.  So once they've. 
[00:56:30]  Tish, you're speaking French.  Once they've discovered these genes,  you know, they just recommend that those women have mastectomy.  That's French.  What language is that?  Fait accompli.  What's that?  It's English, my friend.  What?  Yes.  No, it isn't.  It's not from the French term.  It's an English term, but it's derived from the French.  I never heard of that.  Sort of like the word garage.  It's a French word.  Galage.  Yes, exactly.  Yo, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  We were talking yesterday because you were helping me out with my allergy bullshit. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, man.  I'm going to send you some nice wine, by the way.  You don't have to do that.  I'm going to, though.  Thank you.  Can we talk about the other thing that we talked about last night?  What was the other thing we talked about?  I'll just give you the word space.  The final frontier.  These are the voyages.  You told me, we were talking, you told me something very fascinating yesterday.  It was a bit personal.  Space.  Oh, yeah.  Sure, sure.  I wasn't sure if it was one of those things. 
[00:57:30]  Dr. Steve, one of his really good friends, was on the fucking space shuttle.  Yeah.  What?  Because we were seeing Donna Summer?  Because I saw that video that we were watching yesterday.  I decided to watch that whole fucking thing, that 19-minute documentary.  Yeah.  I forgot the name of it.  It's on our Facebook page.  You know, how they looked at the Earth, space, and how it affected all these astronauts when  they came back home.  Yeah.  And I told Dr. Steve that, you know, he should probably see this because he's into astronomy 
[00:58:00]  and all that shit.  And then he tells me a story that one of his good friends and the reason why he's a doctor  was on the space shuttle.  Yeah.  Really?  I was selling CB radios and he came in and...  What do you mean he came...  You didn't tell me this part.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  No.  Well, that's why I went to medical school.  I'd been thinking about it for a while.  But I was always afraid to take the physics and the biology and all that kind of stuff. 
[00:58:30]  I was a lazy son of a bitch.  So what did I do?  I got a degree in radio, television, and motion picture.  And you ended up selling CB radios.  Yeah.  And I...  Wait, how old were you when you were selling CB radios?  I was 25 at that point.  Holy fuck.  I had already worked in championship wrestling and I just realized TV wasn't for me.  And I got this...  I've actually never seen Dr. Steve's medical certificate. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, no.  So the astronaut guy walks in to buy...  Yeah, he walks in and he's like, can you help me put up my ham radio antennas?  And I sketched a little drawing on and said, here, just do this.  Get out of here.  And the next day, this gorgeous, beautiful girl.  Yeah, he's like a child.  She was just absolutely gorgeous woman comes in and she's giving me that come hither look. 
[00:59:30]  And I'm like, well, what do we have here?  You know, in a CB store, that doesn't happen.  And she came up to the counter and said, would you help me or would you help my husband put up his ham radio antenna?  And it was like, hell yeah, I will.  So I went over and he was just as dumb as a brick when it came to this stuff.  But it turned out he was a doctor.  And I figured, well, shit, if he can do it...  Wow, you inspired. 
[01:00:00]  Then I can do it.  So yeah, that's why I finally applied to medical schools because of that guy.  Well, anyway...  It gets way better.  So then you guys become pretty good friends?  Yeah, yeah.  We were best friends inseparable for a period of time.  But until his wife left him.  Oh, boy.  For you.  Uh-oh.  Wait, you got to...  Yeah, then something happened.  And a switch went off in his head.  And he kind of became obsessed with her.  And she decided she was going to go to a different profession and move to a different town. 
[01:00:30]  And he would, like, get an apartment right across from her and not turn on the heat or the lights  and just have a lawn chair and a telescope and stuff like that in there.  Whoa.  And this was after he was in space on the space shuttle?  No, no.  This was before.  Wow.  How did he pass the psych?  He couldn't get far enough away from her after a while.  He said, fuck it, I want to leave the planet.  How did he pass the psych is right.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  So, well, he was really, really smart.  And he had a great personality.  I mean, this guy could just charm anybody.  Wait, but you watched him fall apart in front of your eyes?  Yeah.  And it was all over a woman?  It was all over one thing.  You know, he was just obsessed with her.  Wow.  So he kind of got over it.  But he never could stop trying to impress her.  And so he went into the, I guess, who is the Blue Angels?  Is that the Navy?  I'm not sure.  He was, he, whatever that was. 
[01:01:30]  The Air Force, I think.  Blue Angels?  One of those.  No, Blue Angels is the Navy.  Underbirds.  Blue Angels, either Navy or Air Force.  He was interested in astronomy and stuff.  But his whole life was to, he decided to do all these things to impress this woman that  didn't give a fuck about him anymore.  And that led to him absolutely going in space.  Yep.  The only reason he went to space was to fucking try to impress this broad going, look, now  I'm in space.  Not many people get to do this.  Damn.  Right? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Are they back together?  Did it work?  No.  It didn't work.  As a matter of fact, he killed himself afterwards.  So, it was, uh.  What?  Wait, he's not on the space shuttle now?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  This guy, this is why this is an amazing story that Dr. Steve was telling me last night.  Really killed himself?  Yeah.  And the reason he went into the space shuttle program and went to space was to try to impress  her, not for his own fucking career.  And that didn't impress her.  Optimously, if I want to trivialize it quite that much, you know, on a national radio show, 
[01:02:30]  but that was a lot of people's theory at the time.  Wow.  He did that.  Oh, wow.  What a tragic story to Dr. Steve.  Jesus.  And it was Dr. Steve's best friend for many, many years.  Oh, man.  I was wondering why you were talking about a guy on the shuttle, like, saying he was dumb  and didn't know how to do this.  And I was like, oh, okay, he's not out there now.  But, man.  So, you lost touch with him when he started going crazy?  You decided?  Yeah, we really drifted apart.  Well, she moved away, and he kind of followed her around for a while, and then I think just 
[01:03:00]  finally kind of gave up, but never really gave up inside, you know.  And so, yeah, we just completely lost touch, because, you know, you just can't.  And how many years did he last after the space shuttle mission?  It was quite a few.  Okay.  But he wasn't the same.  Yeah, it was never the same.  You know, I tried not touching him a couple of times, and just said, you know, dude, what  was space like?  And he was just like, it was unbelievable. 
[01:03:30]  But, you know, it just, you know.  But she wasn't there.  It wasn't enough for him.  And she was.  Wow.  You know what?  I can miss a fucking girl pretty bad, too.  Right up until the tip of my dick slides into a new vagina.  That's always been my cure.  Then it's who?  That's the cure, right?  Who?  What?  Oh, fuck.  I remember her.  That'll cure your ills.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  You want to, what was his name, even though, I'm sure.  I'd rather, it'd be better if I didn't give his name. 
[01:04:00]  I'm sure people are already Googling their asses off.  Neil Armstrong.  Oh.  Neil Armstrong.  What do you think of Buzz Aldrin?  Yeah, that was funny.  He's such a nasty old fuck.  He's just a cranky guy.  He really is not a nice person.  And we were trying hard that day to please Mr. Aldrin.  Well, that was the second time you'd had him on, wasn't it?  Yeah.  He wasn't a nice guy the first time, either.  No.  Or the time I met him outside of radio, he wasn't a nice guy.  He's just not a nice guy. 
[01:04:30]  No.  Yeah.  I wouldn't be either if I was the second dude on the moon.  Second dude.  Fuck everybody.  Second dude.  That's an amazing story, though.  The poor guy.  Yeah.  He wouldn't furnish his apartments or anything.  He would just kind of follow her?  Yeah.  Wow.  And he was a fucking doctor and an astronaut.  Doing some of that astronaut.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's a very sad story, really.  Thanks for the fucking upper.  Yeah.  Fascinating.  What do you tell that one? 
[01:05:00]  Well, on that note.  Tell that one to your patients down at the fucking hospice.  Yeah.  He's got good friends like that.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's Dr. Chip.  Yeah.  I love that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  Now let's do a story about puppies.  Oh.  Yeah.  Why did you kill a bunch of those?  Yeah.  Exactly.  So I didn't imply that.  He just said, hush puppies.

[01:44:00]  getty as long as the program is aired there will be special occasions and i will come back i'm not  walking into the sunset but i don't want to appear on another program i don't want to climb another  mountain i want instead to sit on a sunny field and admire the very gifted women and okay some men  too but we'll be taking my you don't give your retirement speech a year early i know what's that  about yeah you get the gold watch when you make let's say you're retiring but don't make a production 
[01:44:30]  out of it a year from now right i didn't really hear her uh getting emotional or anything uh usually  when you retire uh i've heard anyway right that people that retire they get a little choked up well  she's some people she's a cold-hearted cunt so i don't think that affects her oh oh yeah she doesn't  really have any emotions yeah so i've heard some people do though some people get a little like i don't  know what you're talking about no 18 years ago i lived in ohio wait is this helping with two very 
[01:45:00]  bad knees  and a dream to become a major league baseball player all right  what happened he doesn't say oh i beg god the dream came true  well more barbara walters king my place and and most of all i want to thank  everybody here i've had an amazing career beyond anything i could ever have imagined and i hope i 
[01:45:30]  may also have inspired other women to make television in front or behind the cameras as a career  i smile when some young woman says i grew up watching you on tv it's their time now but remember i have  another whole year to go and i look forward to the next year to my last season during which we have  exciting things planned for abc news and the view and most of all i want to say now to all of you  who have been watching me for so many years and who've traveled the same road that i have traveled 
[01:46:00]  with me we've been together a long time my cup runneth over hi thank you thank you get a napkin  okay that's paper towel it's pulling stuff out of your cup of that's your dumb box runneth over  with married semen why is she doing it a year out ratings yeah yeah next year barbara's last year  the final year of barbara walters and the view a very special year ladies and gentlemen as we say 
[01:46:30]  goodbye rupert pumpkin yeah rupert pumpkin ladies and gentlemen that whatever whatever indeed  oh the castro dude's on suicide watch fidel so why don't they let him kill himself he gives a  fuck yeah why do we have to protect people from killing themselves could you imagine in some of  those like fucking saudi prisons it's like well we put them on suicide watch no i don't think they  care we're just so fucking nice yeah put him in a cell to a fault whatever he decides to do let 
[01:47:00]  him do it who gives a fuck yeah brothers are uh definitely making the rounds and other relatives  oh boy they're on the fuck this guy tour well because they got railroaded by the media they  certainly did i mean i mean there was every news outlet was basically connecting the brothers with  uh the monster brother you know what it's that it's like that when newtown happened they couldn't  quickly enough say that the mother was a teacher at the school right that the the kid's brother right 
[01:47:30]  was the one that did the shooting like they can't get this false information and then the actual you'll  be watching let's say cnn right they come up with all this false shit then five ten minutes later when  they get the right information they'll go well previous reports right said and it's not we said right you  said it uh previous reports were stating no you fucking said right no no you said it's what you 
[01:48:00]  said well the big interview with cnn that's what they've been saying like you know the media you know  kind of the media so you guys were no you guys earlier that's what they say earlier reports stated  right these are uh were false or inaccurate that earlier you mean you said it yeah i mean they basically  said that uh they think the women were being shipped over to the brothers right right the  brothers were involved and then the same thing with the uh the bombers they were talking about that 
[01:48:30]  fucking other kid that that missing right uh kid that was uh well you might have said a thing or two  about that i'm on the opian anthony fucking show it's like okay yeah i was saying if you see him shoot  him i obviously i'm not being uh uh honest all right we might be guilty too because we're looking for  scoops as well yeah right please give me a scoop we might have been guilty a few times in our past but  when the news does that right like giving the wrong names the wrong people uh it's just it's astounding 
[01:49:00]  how fucking wrong they are the problem is that uh the brothers you know most people still think the  brothers are involved what you mean black people the brothers yeah oh they still think they're involved  even though you know cnn did the big interview so they're in hiding yeah and they fucking hate  their brother oh boy they none of that well you know he did something bad but we support him right  no no no they're like fuck him they're like i hope he rots in jail so if he's on suicide watch let 
[01:49:30]  him kill himself yeah save us all the fucking trouble really why do we protect people from from  killing themselves lawyers lawyers that's the only reason lawyers guns and money yes you want to talk  about someone who had a lot of work that jennifer aniston on this avino commercial yeah she's got a  tight face too man yes she does oh yeah look look yeah she's she's had some that's frozen face too frozen

[02:22:00]  down adios i was looking through his text and when he said oh three runs i've rather listen  it yeah okay goodbye goodbye how great is that because you can't go out and just stand people  but you can't bounce them out of a pal talk room yeah do either pal talk yeah there's something  satisfying about that yeah yeah he'll just come back as a new guy yeah well maybe with a new attitude  though yeah maybe with a new attitude maybe now keep that yap of his shut that's right you think

[02:26:00]  had arthritis we couldn't work out anymore right right right hey boy when you was being dragged under  that van in that naked gun movie that was hilarious why thank you thank you can i sign something for you  yeah yeah could you sign right under my white power tattoo he's gotta be the bell of the prison  they gotta love the guy yeah who else is locked up in that prison though there might be a real hollywood  it's in vegas right yeah is he in vegas so some good people in there yeah must be it's probably all 
[02:26:30]  gamblers and you think degenerate yeah male prostitutes yeah that's pretty nice okay the wrong time to get  fat so nobody's gonna want to fuck him anymore should have went in when he was a little younger  yeah prisons for the young it really is yeah he's got sad eyes now look at that picture jim  i know sad yeah he's doing all right looks like a fat chinese man though he just doesn't look the  same anymore he could be he's the biggest fall from grace ever in the history of of humanity honestly 
[02:27:00]  you got to think about where he was jimmy yes in the 70s there was no athlete more loved  than oj simpson they couldn't give him more endorsement deals yes the companies loved him  as a representative and a spokesperson uh and the american people he was the smiling happy he was  like he was like the michael jordan of the time as far as getting all the endorsements huge  oj simpson made sugary linnet look like old dirty bastard when it came to endorsements yeah absolutely 
[02:27:30]  and and now look you know the murder rap or he he skated on the murder thing when everyone pretty  much is like right and then now he's in prison dude it's a fall from fucking grace steeper than  any i've seen i can't name another i can't think of one huge that huge i used to look in jet magazine  and see oj and they're like he's living the life living the life man how good his life is that's  his kids right look at him golfing there's his kids he's golfing nobody got that fucking buxom 
[02:28:00]  blonde by his side fucking oj man yes he's driving fucking nice cars he's living in brentwood yes damn  and then who knew all from grace all these days i'd rather be marcus allen  marcus got the same booty same moot and he's free just a little bit of a softer temper i gather 
[02:28:30]  eric eric dickerson never almost decapitated anyone did he  had tony gorsett get a little lop my head off  oh oh j  he had it good he had it good and he beat the rap again how do you  fucking not be the greatest guy in the world after you beat a double murder rap  with all that evidence and shit you beat it i wouldn't fuck it you got my memorabilia okay enjoy  it you have fun i'm gonna come over there and sign every piece of it for you i think that trial 
[02:29:00]  broke him so much like financially yeah that it sent him into because we never saw oj acting hungry  for money before and remember no no no so i think he got so caught up in his own head that he did  something but you know it's so fucked up he could have just gone out was he able to still go out and  just do signings for money or i don't know take all that but fred got a piece of everything he lost  that civil suit everything fred got everything got a piece of everything so that was a taste of 
[02:29:30]  everything so he was great because dude he would have a fucking line at a comic-con or someplace like  that he would have a line out the door for autographs a lot of people might not hire him  though because of the the maybe uh yeah you might be right the backlash that yet like you have this  guy who everyone knows killed his wife like it's a weird thing with those that's not worth much  money anymore that's true uh they would have found someone somebody would have hired online maybe  really really and she's broke and she's going through she went to the fucking she's still crushing 
[02:30:00]  on oj though yeah i'm still i'm gonna get a piece of that someday  wow man yeah it was such a brutal crime it's a really tough one yeah because there were photos of it  and he was i forgot about the fact that he had some money-making ventures after the the trial but  no one really wanted to pick up on it yeah online sales are where because people could order stuff 
[02:30:30]  privately online yeah but to go to a signing and meet people would have got pictures with him but  i don't know how many were right right people would have been yelling stuff at him yeah oh my god  right yeah thank you okay remember him on the golf course when people would they'd have video of oj on  the golf course he's you know at the tea and people yell murder killer and he would look over  and wave hey how you doing right all right he's real killer that's what he should have did he should  have got went to like a uh carnival or something got into the dump tank  you murder her yeah yeah all right oh you dunk me you could throw softballs with blonde hair on them 
[02:31:00]  oh oj silly goose  but we all pretty chris uh who i know is on your show tonight uh chris rock played a very funny message  from oj oh yeah one of his specials because what did he what he had teased oj or something i wouldn't  have killed her but i understand oh yeah yeah he played that on oprah too chris he played that on 
[02:31:30]  oprah and oj called him and left him a message and laughing it was like man you  wait can we find that it's got to be out there i want to use i i don't think i've ever heard it oh  yeah jay left chris a message for teasing him but it wasn't a nasty message it wasn't nasty but it was  creepy i'm coming for you i'm just kidding just kidding didn't he feel like you're dogging me or you're  doing something uh oh it's not like that yeah he put i remember oj remember he left that oj left a 
[02:32:00]  message on his machine we have the answering machine message from oj from oj okay play that will you  john hey man uh you dogged me in your last show but i understand that's scary  that's scary that's sorry that's scary wow there was some seriousness there you dogged me in your  last show but that's okay is there anything else in the club or that was pretty much it two things i 
[02:32:30]  hate people it's fine people two things i hate is people dogging me in their show  and people driving my cars oh that's so sad he's never getting out man i don't see  no i think when he get out he's gonna be so even sadder how old is he now he's 65 he'll be 70 when  he gets out but he's too arrogant to kill himself when he came out with that book if i did it right  if was really small and then he gave it a lower case letter as well yeah yeah i forgot about it 
[02:33:00]  it was like i did it wait and here's what convinced me that he did it too besides the evidence who said  he said that if i did it maybe ron goldman would have gotten into a judo stance and you know that's  what happened oj came over freaked out and uh i i think goldman fly got into a karate stance and oj just  killed him like he went ballistic because you think he just that guy was there to fuck nicole  and that's what i think and fucking you know he just went crazy as a man he couldn't handle some 
[02:33:30]  younger guy fucking his wife it really is an unbelievable amount of evidence and when you  just look at it on the outside and go like okay here's this guy he's with this fucking blonde  he's fucking her and everything mother of his kids and then you get this little  fucking young snot nose guy comes in oj must have fucking been real pissed and the kid was probably  more arrogant about it again i don't know but yeah there's kind of like the story with um uh  mike tyson mike tyson told the story about going over to robin gibbon's house and brad pitt was there 
[02:34:00]  all right yeah yeah you would think mike tyson would be the dude who killed somebody right not oj yeah  how is mike tyson coming off reasonable yeah yeah yeah yeah oh brad i love you in seven  it was great what was in the box yeah he said did he say brad was it put some crap was a  fucking uh mellow uh really mellow about it i forget how he said he was here of course you  don't want to fucking yeah you don't want to make any fast movements it's like yeah oh you know robin  gibbon's like what you gonna do about it this ain't yours no more oh man oh man how great was that 
[02:34:30]  one-man show you saw it obviously the mike tyson one-man show you haven't seen it he tells that story  brad why don't you tell him to get his black ass out this motherfucker robin shut the fuck up  let me get out of here that's how girls get you beat down oh man yeah they know how to do that  shit yes i'm not shutting up here i tell the story about in the movie theater when that happened with  me and my chick a long time ago sit in the movies and there's a whole row of uh hispanic family

[02:36:00]  the idea of being front yeah so we just uh i i was like yes okay honey let's go let's go  we showed that we're leaving the theater yeah it would be great if they would have just american  mead stabbed you right there yeah right just one of those quick fucking rapid fire shankings  yeah it's not even a stabbing it's a fucking shanking did you get uh did they say anything  on the way out or no oh yeah yeah the fucking bitch was like yeah you keep walking keep walking

[02:37:00]  bitch starts mouthing off to the guy now you gotta stand up for your chick right and he's gotta be pissed  at you because you got a loud mouthed bitch now you're fucked ladies shut the fuck up yeah both  should have stood up and punched both your girls in the face shake hands watch the movie together  yeah both girls laid out yes patrice told a story about that where his chick was was  von was mouthing off to somebody oh man patrice said to her to the guy like now you have to deal with 
[02:37:30]  them now obviously the guy didn't do anything right right he said something to the guy about it like he  was so annoyed that she had put him that's a good right thing to defuse yeah now you deal with it  i'm gonna watch yeah yeah like what do you want me to do i didn't do this go wrestle him yeah yeah  you chick doesn't seem like she does that though no she is she wouldn't she wouldn't push it off on  me like that yeah she's usually trying to calm me down from choking somebody at a drive-thru  yeah sharon has a bit of a reputation oh yeah yeah yeah it's being a guy who's cement handed 
[02:38:00]  i don't like injustice yeah i'm fighting injustice on the fucking line at on the drive-thru line yes  a lot of injustice going on in that loudspeaker there's been a few of those stories where you're  coming on a tuesday like what will you sunday what happened nah sharon knocked somebody out in front of  the cellar holy shit for what reason you just one time some dude acting a crazy acting crazy outside the  cellar right the crowd's coming out people saying great job thanks for the show some dude has grabbed 
[02:38:30]  his girls like bra top and pulled it off oh shit pulled it off and the guy she was with was a little  dude so he didn't want to and i was like yo what the what are you doing yeah the guy was like what you  gonna do at smash wow really wait was the guy in the audience no he was just walking by that's what you  do too turns out the guy who i knocked out this at that time was one of he worked for noam he's a  bartender around the corner at the village underground and he fucking pulled the girl's  shirt was he drunk yes he was on something and he was with like two other dudes holy 
[02:39:00]  fucking just pulled a bra i like that whole thing like yeah and you decided i gotta knock  this guy out yes because i saw the guy she was with he was like oh wow talk is for movies  talk is for the movies i like that what you're gonna bam this boy was pulling him away to ben's  pizza trying to put water on him  it was great yeah that's fucking awful i i also feel bad for the little nebbishy guy  yes that's that he's that she's with like how familiar right yeah he was in a no-win scenario 
[02:39:30]  that's why the dude was acting even bolder uh-huh because he saw that he had a win with the short  dude yeah but then even after that he's got to look at you and be like oh man in the end he's  still humiliating his chick is looking going oh my hero my hero  knock out a lot of people there charade nah no just here there that's here and there 
[02:40:00]  ones that deserve it i got knocked more than i knocked out but i saw you one time getting pulled  there was a it was a big argument in the in the hallway of the fucking cellar it was like you  walked down the steps to walk into the right of the room and there was some big bald guy he was a  big dude and you and him were being pulled apart and he said something i don't know if he said  anything racist but he said something that really put you over the edge and uh you probably don't even  remember he said godfrey was funnier yeah oh shit but i forget what it was but i was i was the 
[02:40:30]  the only time i ever saw you in a real rage trying to get to that guy wow and it wasn't fake i want to  get to him it was real trying to get to him i want to get to him where you don't want to get to him  yeah you're allowed to hold your back you go but you back up into him yeah  a 12 year old's holding you back that's not worth it  i remember one time i broke up a fight at the cellar between kevin brennan and greg rogel yeah  and they were going out and they knocked esty to the ground in the hallway wow yeah it was real 
[02:41:00]  i wasn't there but i heard i remember hearing about them scrapping or what was that girl's got anger  money yeah but what was that problem about they never come out you never know it could have just  been sometimes guys working in the same situation night after night for years just something something  gets said i mean i really never found out yeah something got said i think they were talking about  a joke but maybe yeah jesus and the next thing i know rogel was on kevin's neck like digging in his neck  his neck bleeding fc's on the ground wow and i see rogel all the time he's like such a he's a mellow 
[02:41:30]  guy like yeah yeah he's just come back from tour with uh russell peters uh overseas yeah he's been  working with russell in like 16 000 seat venues overseas nice intimate uh setting oh two arena  yeah he sold it out yeah he sold out the o2 in london he sold out  russell is one of the biggest comics in the world wow man i'd be happy to go but he's you know i'd probably  bomb in front of him why why do you say that to me he said well greg's of this crowd you have to  you know because they're like very muslim and he has a you know he's a hardcore him and you just have 
[02:42:00]  a jim norton audience it's a different crowd so he knows better it was better cause a problem  i'd give you a shot jim thanks in front of a muslim audience people oh yeah like if it was al-qaeda  here's my impression of a headless torso  yeah i don't uh it's funny the cellar has a really weird vibe to it like there's times where you feel  like man something can happen because there's so many people just walking in and uh there's so many 
[02:42:30]  people they're not fans of mine or they're not fans of you they're just people who come to a show  right and you never know what the vibe is going to be but isn't that good for you guys yes to work  on new material it does help because if it does toughens you up a little bit yeah definitely if it  gets a six in the cell yeah oh senator one more joke i love your suit it uh  uh he said because they own it um so uh if it gets a six in the cellar it'll get like a nine on 
[02:43:00]  the road with my audience you know that's why i work on the material there but sometimes i just like  mother's day i fucking bombed on mother's day oh really oh fucking bunch of cunts with their offspring  yeah yeah let's take mom out fuck her was it polite titters or yeah was it just silence there  was a well a lovely mixture of both nothing above a polite titter oh it was packed sold out was it  oh god they were hanging from the rafters and then it's just what was their problem are you working 
[02:43:30]  on new material or they just weren't your crowd did anyone do well ryan hamilton was up first and  he our mothers love him they do yeah but he felt they were tight and arty fouqua they love too  okay uh me not so much oh arty likes to knock out people too man yeah arty fouqua i've seen two  fights with him yeah one in atlantic city and one outside the cell matter of fact yeah he went at it  i saw him go out oh yeah outside the cellar before holy smash this kid and he does it all the kid 
[02:44:00]  would start with arty but he does it with a smile on his face that's what's creepy about him yes he  keeps smiling the whole time as he's knocking people out he's a mouth breather holy yeah  fuck jesus keith wants that reputation but keith is just old man philly anger like something will  happen and keith's like yeah play it and just hit himself and go ah you know what it is i showed  that motherfucker yeah yeah give me another swirl exactly he's just an old wine drinking drunk he is  it's an old wino keith used to fight a lot but now he's just fucking grady from stanford 
[02:44:30]  just getting sauced  keith had a reputation too though there was something yeah you could tell yeah definitely  keith is old school he fight cops yeah yeah yeah he's that kind of dude yeah i fight yeah yeah  he'd have one on each arm and one on each leg oh motherfucker put me down yeah there's a  story kevin hart and him and they got pulled over for some you know and i was with keith once when 
[02:45:00]  we got stopped it was me keith patrice and it might have been kevin too and they lived in woodbridge  i think i was the only white guy in the car excuse me i noticed uh while you were driving you were  black yes sir driving oh you were they said are you okay sir and you picked him up at 7-eleven  situation where's your precinct officer and uh yeah i think it was uh i believe it was when uh  didn't they all live together kevin patrice and uh and uh and keith i think lived so i was driving 
[02:45:30]  back to wait and uh we got to stop we were just sitting in the parking lot talking and uh cops came  over and again we weren't doing anything but the car wasn't moving it was just no i think we were just  something they just we were like in a a nighttime parking lot four it is kind of suspicious yeah  yeah i think and they came over and uh but jimmy was with a tranny  two really hot ones and a little short passable one 
[02:46:00]  um and fucking uh they came over they said hey what are you guys doing and you know it would have  been very quick like all you guys say is that you know we just came back from the comedy club and  then cops immediately oh but you know keith was like wow what we just uh you know he immediately  again oh my god and i'm like keith shut the fuck up man this is my car like you know i don't want  to get i'm the one who's gonna get a ticket or get the you know whatever not you he's the worst  i thought we'd take care of it right here in brainerd exactly yeah  fucking buscemi and his partner handled the police better than fucking keith and patrice did 
[02:46:30]  so what happened they went away eventually i mean we just talked he made a little uh he made it a  little tougher and i think i'm trying to think i don't remember how patrice handled it i don't  remember how he was he probably got you guys out of it no kevin would have been the most reasonable  of those three guys really yeah because he can slip out of handcuffs yeah he's cute and pixie-ish  and now he's not but now he's just oh that's fucking funny though what is your show about uh  it's the united states of hip-hop it's just a pop culture show and music on fuse on fuse right 
[02:47:00]  across from the garden yeah good jimmy dolan paying for everything god bless him where do we get  fuse on files on files some fucking yeah i know time one is 132 oh okay that's good to know i'm  writing that down actually my time warner box in my uh apartment sucks right it's rebooting so i'm  gonna go back uh next weekend and uh turn on tv i gotta call holy fuck it takes forever to reboot a  box they got a countdown on there i hate that countdown it's terrible i gotta call those fuckers today

[02:48:00]  will be talking yes well we're going to take the book and it just freezes everything up it's so  annoying what the fuck man yeah let's shut out erase it erase my whole list oh man oh no this is  gone oh that makes me angry imagine all the fucking like and we find game of thrones and walking dead  and all that we fine-tuned it all those weird obscure shows now we forgot half the stuff you feel like  you did something when you you clear out your dvr all right i could delete that again and it's all 
[02:48:30]  clear your percentage capacity percentage is up ah i'm good i'm ready for some new and then it wipes it  out uh oh man that's completely gone i was trying to watch game of thrones at bob kelly's house and he's  got time warner and we were just he was so angry i was so happy to see bob freezing yeah because every  time it would it was like and every time it would stop for three seconds bob would be like all right  i think this is good oh no it's gonna happen again he can't get files in his building it'll  happen again you know what works sometimes you pause it you pause the fucking show and wait like 
[02:49:00]  five minutes and and it'll buffer up on you and then you can watch it but you shouldn't have sure  that works i heard that's a good tip it does i have files i don't need to do that shit anymore  really so files is never is is fucking great i've never had a problem with it no and if i did which  i i've had problems with my internet and the guys have shown up and fucking they take care of it  fox has second fox has detroit on the uh the news financial show city on the verge of the  holy fuck man poor detroit they're in trouble they're showing uh strip malls completely grown in 
[02:49:30]  well they're fucking the mayor and the city council and shit they have been just  partying it up right and now the the state has to take over so the governor has appointed a  guy to take care of the finances for detroit and now the fucking city council and the mayor  and shit are all up in arms going whoa wait a minute we were elected and we should do this like  you fucked up you fucked it up the city's broke they gotta get a guy in there now to start chopping  the budget and figuring out what's gonna happen you think i know are we gonna be able to save that 
[02:50:00]  city or we're just gonna let it just fucking rot it makes more sense now that the show hardcore  pawn is making so much money everybody in detroit selling them they're selling something is that  where that takes place yeah yeah yeah they're gonna have slaves before you know it it's uh  they're in a bad situation what do they do do they let it rot eventually or they've already pulled the  city borders i know i know they moved the city borders in because in order to they created like  a no-man's land in order to uh cut down on the amount of abandoned uh houses and businesses they had 
[02:50:30]  instead of just knocking down the businesses or getting new business they just made the city  smaller so now on the outskirts of the city are these abandoned buildings that are literally in  no man's land they just showed it by anybody complete strip malls completely abandoned it's  a stunning there's no industry there that's what the auto industry is the auto industry is pretty  fucking much done it's kind of like that show on a history channel 100 years after people yeah  that's what they pretty much just showed yeah it's fucking sad it used to be a 
[02:51:00]  fucking thriving uh the birds will take over the structure yes in 200 years steel will start to  rust and i love that show i love it just watch it go like damn i'd like to fucking see that what  would be here 10 million years what they say would styrofoam make it or plastics or certain metals or no  10 million no sign that we would ever hear even styrofoam things they say couldn't break down  it would just grind up into nothing i think they said certain cement structures might still be 
[02:51:30]  in place in 10 million years yeah yeah certain cement wow but like what like a little wall here or  there yeah be like no not little wall like huge foundations to things that were like poured in  shine like like like the hoover dam pieces of the hoover dam base like would still be  there but it wouldn't be visible though no no everything would be buried up and grass  over done they say that happens pretty quickly with uh with leaves that fall and rot and then more 
[02:52:00]  leaves and nothing that happened in two hours how big leaf removal would be in this country  with that and the wind and stuff it literally makes soil new soil and then trees start growing out of  that takes root breaks apart roads like tree roots are really fucking strong right and if you get  enough of them growing on sidewalks and roads it'll just crush it so uh yeah it wouldn't take long  before you really kind of nature takes over that's why it's like we're killing our planet 
[02:52:30]  fuck you not at all this thing will recoup in a hiccup yes uh after we were gone anything we leave here  even nuclear power plants fucking there would be meltdowns and shit like that but you get enough time  all that shit would be gone buried over with fucking bugs and plants and feces right lots of  lots of feces everything yeah people aren't doing shit don't worry about it all covered in  shit you're like yeah no one shops here anymore you know who's obsessed with uh the earth and

[03:03:30]  it's just these these are just never nine it's just uh there's one where there's a guy on the  runway yeah it's on this and they go by so fast exactly it's it almost looks like if he jumped up at  one point the one guy he would get killed whoa he got an f16 right over now we're just uh are you sure  this is yeah i think this is it that's number seven there's a man  wow blue angels oh that's 20 feet off the water and then he goes and he just rockets straight up 
[03:04:00]  into the air imagine if that's how your plane took off when you just hit the flight here's  here's one of them oh this guy's standing there a soldier right over his head and it comes  so faith you have to have oh he got scared that was less than 10 feet over his head that noise is  intimidating oh yeah that was a different one so loud and so low no these are not that great 
[03:04:30]  there's one that was the one we just saw was great the guy got scared no there was one where  a guy stands there and it goes right over i think that might be number one we'll see in a second here  we'll put these up online so everybody can uh yeah they can go pay attention to where these are i have  no idea yeah oh this might be the guy yeah oh that's it let me see that again yeah

[03:11:30]  getting dropped syrup yeah and you got he keeps getting you got dropped from mountain dew yeah  why do you drop from mountain dew because he's so naughty because he said something racist the whole  question is is like why these companies keep hiring these rappers and then firing them for  acting like rappers that is a good uh because they make quick coin real fast and then they  just drop that makes sense who do you think is going to push mountain dew little wayne's audience 
[03:12:00]  is probably a mountain dew audience who are you going to get yeah that's what i'm saying they're  a sister ball yeah it's not a two skaters though the skaters right people yeah they like him yeah  that's what i would say on the show they like him why are you trying to pitch yourself yeah  you're the host so i'm showing you that i can do this variety of topics  you're very good but you look super duper white while you do it that's the beauty of me i show  that it's not just a black thing rapper i can big daddy kane sure i enjoy set it off back to you

[03:27:00]  my entire being last week i can't tell i don't think there hasn't been any allergy that's bad  enough that i've noticed it through the sickness but you could tell i think you could tell my normal  murderous voice is starting to squeak through again so best of luck to me 516 you're on after  opening anthony live thank you very much 201 podcast premieres tomorrow yes the opian anthony

[03:36:30]  make yourself comfortable wherever you want how's it going as early as hell it is that's what it is  you're not an early riser hell no no no you get up at noon 9 11. that's nice that's nice you know you  always uh i'm glad that you're honest about that though because hip-hop guys they always come in  they're like no man i'm about my business i'm up at five o'clock in the morning doing like 50 cent  comes in and he pretends he never goes to sleep but look at his look at his complexion he goes to  sleep at some point and then bags under his eyes right i mean no i i'm i'm out i'm djing all the 
[03:37:00]  time and i'm out so i'm i'm not going to bed till 4 or 5 a.m so you still you still actively djing  clubs yeah i mean i have a residency at vegas at the wind i just oh okay you know uh vegas resident dj of  the year wow so yeah i'm definitely djing very heavily so you and pan gillette are the vegas  guys over on celebrity apprentice yeah he's doing his thing over at i don't know what hotel it is  but yeah i'm at the wind i'm doing all of the wind and the encore clubs what's a residency like like 
[03:37:30]  like what what type of time commitment is that um i i'm there like well the last four weeks i've been  there every week and i have you know last week i had two gigs in four days wow to vegas so you live  out there i pretty much live in the hotel you know is that a weird thing no i mean i mean i live in la  too most of the time like pretty much so it's only out 45 minutes an hour flight from burbank to vegas 
[03:38:00]  so it's like easy right right right do you keep your family in vegas or around burbank oh we live in we  live in um sherman oaks oh okay okay okay now i have to because celebrity apprentice this is your  second season doing it because this is the all-star thing but it did when you were first on celebrity  apprentice it did crazy things because everybody's like what he says more than four words like he's  actually forming sentences and wearing suits and and and doing well on this show yeah i think i  definitely surprised a lot of people with uh how long i lasted especially my cast mates it's funny story 
[03:38:30]  uh the first day we all kind of met as a cast and um well like the first day we all gathered and had  to do like press and pictures i had i had a gig the night before so i was hung over and stuff and i went  and passed out on the couch for like four hours because we had a nice break at one point so everybody's  looking at me like oh yeah he's not gonna last right it's the first time you're meeting all the cast 
[03:39:00]  like all these celebrities like oh what do you and you're just like no dude yeah i'm good they had  no idea so that was just like pretty funny story that you know they were counting me out from the  beginning and then as we you know got to work you know people got to see a different side of me so  the world did too will you just stop partying while you're filming apprentice well i mean you can't do  nothing but work um i would have gigs on the weekend because we would we would work uh monday through 
[03:39:30]  saturday and i and i have saturday nights off and i get on the plane and go somewhere  and you go and do a gig or something yeah but yeah six days a week uh 12 14 hour days so by the  time we wrap it's like get something to eat and go to bed so are you when you do apprentice are you  worried that especially when you first did it that this kind of aura that you've built up around  yourself as just like the party king is going to kind of go away because people are going to see 
[03:40:00]  you as a businessman no because people know i mean i think people understand to be successful in  anything yeah you gotta be some have some kind of focus you can't drink your way into success right  you can't party your way into success you have to focus at some point so as much as you try to look  like it's just an accident somebody just found you to yell at a microphone right you know i think  people at the end of the day know it and i think you know people respect me more especially this 
[03:40:30]  season like i got a lot of respect after doing the first season from people that weren't my normal fan  base like grandmothers and grandfathers and this time i've noticed even more of a wide variety of  people coming up it's like the whole family like i uh probably eight ten year old girl came up to me  it's like yes you're a little john from celebrity apprentice and her mom was like yeah we watch you  all the time and the grandma was like yeah i was rooting for you so it's like the whole family 
[03:41:00]  you know because i guess it's sunday sunday nights yeah people are you know families are together and  and i mean they they like the show and thank god for dvr-ing you know uh and t-bone or whatever  because people can watch all of their favorite shows now they have they don't have to miss nothing  because i feel like your first crossover to mainstream success like you're doing crunk forever  and then what really crossed you over to almost pop music was when you had college girls yelling 
[03:41:30]  about sweat dripping down their balls yeah i mean that's still a big record i can i play that record  now and you hear the whole club singing the lyrics and pointing to the window to the wall right but  when you're writing these lyrics and they're like the raunchiest lyrics you've ever heard and then  you're looking around the club and there's girls singing these lyrics like it's nothing are you going  like what are you what are you doing no i mean the yin yang twins wrote that hook but it's still it was  just catchy it was just like a nursery rhyme it's a dirty nursery rhyme right quickly so it's like it's 
[03:42:00]  so catchy and infectious you have to you're gonna chant it so i don't know is that the secret to make  something that's catchy enough because girls will obviously chant whatever if it's catchy right but  dirty enough the guys will be like that's hilarious like is that the secret to i think guys just if  if the women are partying and the guys don't give you know right they don't care they just want to  they following the girls the girls dancing they shaking their asses right twerking twerking as they say 
[03:42:30]  these days right um then they're watching and they don't give a damn you have to stay up on all that by  the way like you have to know what twerking is before i know what twerking is we've been saying  twerking in the south for for 15 almost 20 years is that what's happening you're just waiting for  everybody else to kind of catch up it's a southern term and it just means the booty pop is it is it  difficult though to keep up now because you're kind of you you're more of a mainstream celebrity level 
[03:43:00]  guy and you're an older guy now than you were is that at all is it difficult to keep up with  with what's cool it's definitely a little hard it's harder because you know the the new generation  the music is is a lot different from when i was around and so much has changed but i got like a i  got a 15 year old son so okay so turn me on his stuff like he turned me on a kendrick lamar and a  bunch of other stuff and i'm like wow so it's crazy that i got to go to my son to find out what's the 
[03:43:30]  next or what's the underground right thing it's like i feel like the old guy now uh-huh you know  but but you also hear something that's just ridiculous like we were playing trinidad james  on this show and it's like the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard and you're like well no  he's going to listen to it and you're like no everybody yeah he's listening to that really caught  on really big and that song got big because of the molly line because it's just funny to say pop the  molly i'm sweating right and then the video for the that song was hilarious too so all of that helped 
[03:44:00]  to just launch him into pop culture what do you think about how big scissor has kind of gotten now  like that kind of uh that was another thing that started i'm sure you were aware of scissor from way  back yeah i used to go to texas a lot and it was funny uh sometimes i'd be in a club in houston  and i just see people just sleep and it's that syrup they was on that lean uh-huh and they just 
[03:44:30]  sleep in the club sleep like i'm like what the hell and they like that's that syrup man so  yeah they've been doing that forever too in the south and in mainly in texas then it started to  spread out now it's all over the place i never touched that stuff you don't know why i don't  want to be sleepy right because you see these people that sleep in the club and you're like  i'd rather be wired i drink tequila don julio somebody's liable to be taken advantage of in  that position for real you're just an alcohol guy yeah i just drink don julio tequila man a lot of 
[03:45:00]  tequila is there any lyric when you're writing lyrics is there any time when you're like because i would  imagine when you're first starting you're like okay i really got to think about these lyrics and put  and then you kind of realize no i gotta be as simple as humanly possible is there any lyric that  you've ever been like this is this is too simple there's no way that something as basic as this  yeah when i did i did a really big song on my album called lovers and friends with usher and 
[03:45:30]  ludicrous right it's a line in the song in the song i said up in the bathtub rubber dubbing  and i was like oh well i was like fuck it it works fuck it yeah and then some people in the  beginning were like uh what is he talking about yeah and then the song was just huge and it was  crazy to me when people would play the song that's the lyric that stuck out the most out of everything  usher said everything ludic said it was you you can fade the fader over in the whole club 
[03:46:00]  in the bathtub i was like wow that's fucking crazy you just really don't know yeah you just don't  know sometimes but you got at that point when something like that happens you just say i'm just  going to trust myself right from here on out and as weird as it gets whatever exactly because it's  really about the feeling when you're making music it's about what feels right it's i mean my wife  she gets drunk like one glass of wine is all she can handle but it doesn't stop her from yelling out 
[03:46:30]  shots when that song comes on she's not doing any shots that song is going to be the college uh well  the worldwide drinking anthem forever like it's amazing to be a part of something that you know  is going to last forever like i was blessed to have get low they're still going right i was blessed to have  yeah they're still going i was have blessed to have blow the whistle they're still going you know and  then to get on a record like shots that is the drinking that is our this age is tequila yeah you 
[03:47:00]  know like that song tequila tequila y'all know that but anyway that shots has taken over taking that  song spot there's no other song that epitomizes drinking like shots does do you ever get heat from  people who like well he's a that you're a bad influence no yeah it never happens early in my  career because uh all your lyrics to great women right right right we went through that era yeah but 
[03:47:30]  then the whip i mean and what's the best route you just kind of ignore it and say i'm just making  party songs like i mean i make music for grown-ups yeah i don't make music for a 10 year olds and  i'm not degrading women i'm just talking about what i see you know and if you don't understand  that culture then you can't speak on that culture because that doesn't fit for you so you know i  don't i don't degrade women at all i respect women a lot my mother was the strong figure in my life so 
[03:48:00]  i have a lot of respect for women i just talk about what i see in the club or whatever and then you put  the song on in the club and it's not like women are looking around at you outraged like how could you  say this please turn that off yeah right yeah they're shaking their damn asses right it's not my  fault you're doing your job your daughter is twerking in the club i didn't teach her how to  twerk i just supplied her the the rhythmic she learned from youtube yeah twerking is taught in the  home i was surprised that miley cyrus made a twerk video yeah did you see that video i didn't see 
[03:48:30]  the miley cyrus twerk video she has on a costume and she's twerking it's kind of weird is it a good  is she good at it she i mean she got a little booty a little booty so it's not twerking as hard  no but she twerking it right twerking a little booty it's like it's not the size of the boat it's  the motion of the ocean but i mean i give her a thumbs up for trying yeah yeah a for effort yeah  did you see the video of uh like 30 kids got suspended for high school from high school 
[03:49:00]  because they had their av department and it was like three guys and then like 27 girls and they  all got together and made a twerking video with in the high school with all the high school's  department and like you know the one guy was just kind of standing there looking cool and then like  19 girls were standing no it was twerking because they were standing on their heads oh they were  doing that's what they call express yourself that's diplo's thing when they when they're on their heads  and their feet are on the wall yes yeah that's express yourself oh okay okay keep up man you're good 
[03:49:30]  express yourself i'm not in the club like you're in the club that's where it happens  that's another craze that's going around like that's different than twerking it's it's a i guess  it's a part of twerking right the song that where that started from was a song called express yourself  by diplo and it's it's actually a twerking song it's a song the guy i think is from new orleans and  the beat is new orleans influenced and twerking kind of comes from new orleans um p-popping music 
[03:50:00]  uh booty kind of booty shaking music and basically in the video he had some girls upside down shaking  their asses on the wall and that it was express yourself so they call it start he started a thing  called he just might people might tweet pictures of themselves and it'd be tagline hashtag express  yourself and that's what they're doing they're on their heads twerking on their heads expressing  themselves expressing yourself girl y'all can express yourselves right now yeah go out there unless  you're driving yeah yeah yeah in which case pull over and express yourself on the side of the road 
[03:50:30]  um when you were making the are you married you're married right yeah how long have you been married  for eight years now wow so eight years that's kind of a lot of the height of your fame really right  like mainstream fame is that difficult i mean it's hard when you're on the road like i'm yeah i just don't  get to see my family and you know as much as as possible but you know you learn to when you come off  the road you just make up make that time up with your family spend as much time as possible but is 
[03:51:00]  it difficult to avoid temptation because i mean i know i wasn't in college that long ago and when i  was in college i mean any any white college girl wanted to get with little john oh lord you know is  it difficult to avoid that kind of temptation and be like him everything in life is difficult you just  gotta you just gotta you know you have to just teach yourself you know what's right what's wrong and  yeah kind of okay thank you bye and realize realize that every one of those girls has a cell phone 
[03:51:30]  camera it's nothing gonna be private no um but did you were you able to get a lot of that out of your  system before you're married anyway yeah i mean when i was i started partying at 16 i was having house  parties at 16 in my mom's basement we had a pretty nice size house and so i i went through a lot of  partying so i mean like i had i was a black kid we had kegs black kids don't have cake parties we had  cake parties wow so you know i had some partying going on in my backyard did you grow up in a black 
[03:52:00]  neighborhood yeah it was a white it was a black neighborhood you just you were the black kid with  the kegs well i mean we i used to skate so we were you know we were in different kind of culture like  i got you i grew up i mean i went to a black high school but i was a black skater in a black high  school in the 80s and this was before like lil wayne was trying to make black skating cool yeah  everything yeah i mean it was only a couple of black skaters like steve stedham and it was like this  one pro guy in um from atlanta that we you know um skated with sometimes so you know christian 
[03:52:30]  soy and bones brigade and all those guys tommy guerrero those were like my skate idols but it  was no yeah like i said it was only one black pro it was steve stedham and he had dreads how did you  end up skating yeah have you had dreads forever i had dreads since the 90s no okay but how did you  end up skating like how did you get into i don't you know what i got into skating because i ended up  getting a job my first real job was at a shop uh renting skates and bikes to people that went to 
[03:53:00]  the park okay also had a skate they had a skateboard shop next door that was part of the same business  so they i rented the skates and the um the bikes to people there was a bike shop next like joined to  that and then joined to that also was like the skate shop and where you could go buy roller skates and  you can get snacks and ice cream and stuff when you came from the park right so i guess from being 
[03:53:30]  over there i started to see the skaters come up and skating and that's i think that's how i kind of  initially got into skating how did how did the black kids like was skating something you could do that's  i was a damn outcast but they're like what the fuck is john doing on a skateboard well actually i think  i might have started skating because i got into the punk culture i can't remember it was all around  the same time i i was so i'm the black kid in all black high school this punk why would you do that 
[03:54:00]  to yourself you know i mean i just wanted to i don't know i just was expressing myself i guess being  different not like that not like we know express yourself now right i just was you know i guess i just  love culture right in general and i knew things are exciting to me and it always have and it's not it's  not what's around you all the time you're like oh there's this whole punk thing going on over here  like what's this all about and the energy and the mosh pits and the music like it was like wow like  this is amazing and then the kids were ostracizing you but you were like i'm gonna get some kegs over 
[03:54:30]  at my house right actually it's all good crazy thing is i had the biggest parties in high school  even though i was the outcast i had the biggest craziest parties you've always just been a guy who likes  to have parties yeah like you've been a good party host the most amazing thing to me is that i started  doing parties at 16 and i was known for that and now um way later in life i'm known for partying  yeah like like steel it's like a parallel universe but it's crazy that now that's what i'm known for 
[03:55:00]  i knew partying was not for me when i was in college we always used to go to my friends used  to throw the craziest parties right next door so we'd always go to their place it was great right but one  night we me and my roommate were like we should have a party at our place and we got their beer pong  table and we brought it over and i don't know we messaged a couple of our friends i guess but we  ended up like sitting down at the couch at like 10 o'clock and we're like let's just play smackdown  on playstation until people start coming and we're just like on a project x right 
[03:55:30]  and so we're just playing and then we realize it's like 1 30 in the morning nobody's coming this  part so it's not like project no no it's more like uh commercial for playstation that was what we  were doing so we went next door and it was all good but how do you how do you how do you throw  a good party you just gotta know people you gotta have good music you gotta know like in my case  back in the day i used to know a couple of different people at a couple of different schools  and some of them were older so i would just get on the phone some of them were older some of them 
[03:56:00]  were my age i just get on the phone be like yo we'll plan a party in one day we just wake up and be  like let's have a party tonight because i had the turntable set up already in my house so you  just instant party just add dj yeah so we just get on the phone yo i'm gonna have a party tonight  so tell everybody and the people just start calling and it's like the flu and i guess you get a  reputation like oh there's a party here like last time it was good yeah would you need to keep going  the first one of the first big parties i had i had like 40 people spend the night 
[03:56:30]  a 40 people sleepover after that party and was this where your parents weren't home i'm assuming  yeah they were there they were there yeah i mean my house was it's not like were they at the party it  was upper middle class so it was like like a four level house swimming pool tennis court basketball court  so it was like i could be my the basement where i live was like a mini apartment right i had a i had 
[03:57:00]  the turntable set up when you walk down the steps it was like a kitchen area bathroom living room tv  room so it was space for 40 people to congregate and your parents were all good with it yeah they  were like yeah as long as it's in our house at least he's not doing it someplace else exactly he's  gonna end up partying that's obvious uh did you when you had to go on celebrity apprentice did you get  beaten up when you were ostracized or did you just kind of like they were just making fun of you  no they just make fun of right just talk crap right and in black high schools you got to learn to 
[03:57:30]  talk crap back right and then they won't beat you up as long as you could talk with them right so it's  like or i would just act crazy because they used to think they thought punk rock kids would devil  worship right understand the difference between different types of rock music right so i just be  acting like uh and they were like oh that dude is fucking crazy yeah i don't know anything to do with  them all right just talk shit back to them right you just come out you just show up wearing  like all black and like a chain wallet or something i'm around here oh no no i wasn't doing that we 
[03:58:00]  were like crazy little hair and army jackets and shit with combat boots steel toes so that type of  shit so when you like when you're going on the apprentice and you're like okay i'm gonna let  people understand that i know how to operate in a business world i'm you know i'm a well you know what  multi-functioning human being well dave chappelle actually set people up to see the other side of me  well i was gonna have to think about that too i was gonna ask you like you talk about blessings 
[03:58:30]  how amazing was it when that dave chappelle skit took off of him just going you know yeah what  i mean i mean that every time i see dave i thank him because he helped me to go places music would  never have been able to take me yeah and it's and it's classic and that is going to be around forever  as well and it's still hilarious people didn't know who little john was and they were doing the  impression then they found out there was a real little john and they were like oh shit right he  really is this guy too right and it was awesome to go on the show and um to actually do myself 
[03:59:00]  right right you know we to improv with one of the great comedians of our time is who can say they've  done it not a lot of people but you were smart too because like i feel like a lot of people would  have been like look i want everybody to know i'm a lot more than what dave chappelle makes me look  like i don't walk around with that chalice everywhere i say more but you were like no i'm  gonna do it even more whatever he's doing i'm gonna do it more i mean he it was great advertisement for 
[03:59:30]  me yeah and it and and like like i said that it set people up to see the other side because people  were like is he really like that does he because he really get really intelligent you know does he have a  british accent so i mean so the apprentice is not really a far stretch from that it shows people  that basically they're like oh yeah i remember when chappelle did it of course he's like that yeah  but so he's really like that was there any question about whether or not you're gonna take out your 
[04:00:00]  diamond teeth do they come out uh yeah they come out but that's i mean even though i'm on the show i  have to still be myself you know so this is me and donald trump is weird though because like anytime  people have tattoos he's like i hate tattoos but you have like diamond encrusted fangs and he's like  what's up little john that's a smart little john's a smart guy uh he just i guess i gained this respect  you know yeah and i guess it's something you can change like i can take the teeth out right so when 
[04:00:30]  i'm 65 i might not be wearing a grill so they go in and out like every day yeah it's amazing the  lights in here when you're just laughing like how many how much how much is that girl worth do you say  no i don't i don't really know because uh what's the carrot i don't know i actually don't know he's  got little john has like his first like is it just two his first four teeth oh like one two three four  and then and then the fangs come down they're long fangs but they're all is it gold and diamonds yeah 
[04:01:00]  gold and diamonds white and yellow diamonds does it take you a long time to learn to talk with it  i think i mean i had a grill so long it's like i think when i first started i had to love this and  stuff yeah but i mean you get used there was probably a real cheap one at first like it was  like it definitely wasn't like this no like so today for the ones like you have now the real deal  yeah do you have to go to like a dentist and get fitted and no i go to paul wall the rapper the rap paul  wall paul wall gave me my first grill him and johnny dang so so paul wall is like a legit grill 
[04:01:30]  dude he hooked everybody in the industry over grills before he was rapping or or while he was  rapping yeah when when like when they did the song grills yeah and the grills got really extremely  that's just an infomercial for him for real yeah so i mean um yeah he's hooked everybody up and he's  hooked me up for years like he's him and johnny dang do the best work is there a difference like and do  they have to like take a mold of your teeth and everything or they so it's yeah he actually has 
[04:02:00]  taken the mold a couple of times himself for real like he really does that so is there a difference  like is there like past the point of no return is there can it get so ridiculous that you're like  that's stupid man i don't know why you would do that or is it just like yeah keep going yes i think  it's always a ridiculous point like t-pain is my homie but he made a chain that said big ass  chain i'm like t-pain are you kidding me stupid man you got that much money you can make a chain 
[04:02:30]  that says the big ass and it was this big and the words are written in diamonds yes and gold yes and  it's like you're talking about ten fifty a hundred thousand dollars worth of just so you could just be  stupid yes big ass chain how much how much how successful do you have to be before you can actually  afford to do something like that like before i know because some people will buy the grill first  or buy the big ass chain first but you seem like you have a head on your shoulders like how how 
[04:03:00]  successful do you have to be before you could when you could do it that it actually makes sense  well i think once you i know it doesn't ever make sense it's always looking back now all the jewelry i  bought like i'm like why did i even buy some of that stuff i mean but i guess you have to be a part  of the times and you know you have to represent like your peers like you have to you know you have a  certain status you got to keep up with so that's part of it staying in the mix is a big but like an 
[04:03:30]  expensive thing i don't do the jewelry no more the only thing i might do is the old school rope chain  you know i i don't like the i don't like all the flash anymore like i'm not well you've reached a  point in your career like people know who little john is like you you don't need to have that stuff  but i think with a lot of rappers or people who want to look like rappers it's just too much attention  you're drawing to yourself and you you know back in those days you had the source awards and all of 
[04:04:00]  that type of stuff and people get robbed and you know so it was just it isn't too much but then if  you haven't seen we mentioned a minute ago if you haven't seen the trinidad james video looking up  on youtube because then you have him who nobody really knows who he is but he's rolling down the  street with a gold shopping cart so you have to take notice yes watch the video again i never  noticed that it was gold the shopping cart is gold he's holding a puppy in his hand like he's the  man yeah it's it's hilarious video so we gotta let you go uh celebrity apprentice finale is on sunday 
[04:04:30]  sunday were you did you did you think you're gonna win you're in the final four i thought i was  gonna get to the final two you did um did you think it was who was it it was down to like you  and trace right trace and uh pen i thought it was gonna be me and trace actually oh you thought you  guys would be the final two yeah so when he split you guys up into two pairs and said i'm gonna fire  one from pen and lisa and one from john and trace were you going like oh yeah i was like oh 
[04:05:00]  shit yeah i i figured lisa was gonna go i mean i love lisa but lisa she was lucky to make it that  far let's you know i mean you compare lisa and pen you're gonna pick pen right and then me and trace  were i think we were pretty much even he just got me on the fundraising other than that i mean i've  been strong in every task and i kicked ass in every task but i'm just not a good fundraiser like i i don't  know that side i don't you know my friend would rather go spend money on the strip club making 
[04:05:30]  it rain than right charity what it's a write-off a right what yeah i mean i mean people give money  to charity but fundraising is different from yeah taking care of charities so uh and charity is a  stripper's name so um you want to shout out your charity before you go uh american diabetes association  um i think i raised 60 over 60 000 for american diabetes association so pretty pretty major and 
[04:06:00]  just bringing awareness to diabetes more awareness for diabetes you know it's over 25 million people  in america with diabetes and i mean it's a constant struggle to um to find a cure and you're like for me  i went on the show not just trying to find a cure but as far as for friends and family of people with  diabetes that we need to stay on top of our loved ones and make sure they're taking care of themselves  like eating right exercise and taking their medicine yeah because um you know i watched a documentary 
[04:06:30]  about a tribe called quest where fife it was talked about you know show fife struggle with diabetes and he  basically was like you know in the height of my career i wasn't taking care of myself and you know showed  like one time they did uh i think it was arsenio and he couldn't do the show because he had to go to  the hospital and he lost a kidney later on his wife had to donate one of her kidneys you know so that  really hit me and then as well as my mother had a stroke due to diabetes and i didn't even know she 
[04:07:00]  was still dealing with diabetes because i hadn't heard her talk about it or anything  since i was a kid so i was in shock and you know my brother's a doctor and he was like you know part of  the complications for her from her diabetes is because she wasn't managing it as well as she  should have been and if me as her son if i would have known i would have been on her more yeah about  making sure she's taking care of herself so that's one reason i went back on the show well check out
