<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and later Sam Roberts, engaging in graphic sexual banter and vulgar commentary about celebrities.  They then launched into discussions of the Kevin Clash (Elmo) sex scandal and the David Petraeus affair, employing highly offensive language to describe the individuals involved, particularly President Obama and Petraeus's wife, whose appearance was heavily criticized.  Their commentary extended to racist remarks and discussions of websites like "niggermania.com" and Stormfront.org, further fueled by their reaction to a Thanksgiving-themed song featuring young girls.  The segment concluded with cynical observations on MTV's shift away from music videos.

The show continued with a discussion of Jon Stewart's comedic style, followed by one of the hosts' new love song and the bizarre "How Much" segment calculating the fart power needed to inflate a hot air balloon.  A significant portion was devoted to "E-Rock Jingle Day," a contest showcasing listener-submitted jingles, many of which were extremely offensive and focused on E-Rock's weight and eating habits.  E-Rock remained largely silent while the jingles played, to the hosts' amusement.  The segment included calls to the "F.U. line," discussions about E-Rock's upcoming show, "Bagel and with the Sex,"  Anthony's missing Call of Duty game, and a digression into the extensive underground infrastructure of major cities.  The segment concluded with the selection of E-Rock Jingle Day finalists.

The next segment tackled excessive video game packaging, particularly for "Call of Duty: Black Ops 2," with a guest, Corey (a former GameStop/GameCrazy employee), providing insight into pre-order practices.  The conversation then moved to Montreal's underground city, its churches (Notre Dame Basilica and St. Joseph's Oratory), and strip clubs (Club Super Sex).  A caller, Danny, provided historical context regarding the United States' brief control of Montreal. This transitioned into a detailed discussion of Jerry Lawler's near-fatal heart attack during a WWE broadcast and the subsequent storyline involving CM Punk and Paul Heyman, focusing on the interplay between scripted and unscripted elements of professional wrestling.  The hosts discussed the possibility of having Jerry Lawler on the show and receiving a Call of Duty game from a listener, before introducing the next segment with Dr. Robin Zazio.

Dr. Robin Zazio, author of "The Hoarder in You," was then interviewed. The discussion covered hoarding, Dr. Zazio's experiences filming *Hoarders* (including a particularly disturbing episode that almost made her quit),  the psychological aspects of hoarding, and the emotional impact on those involved. The conversation frequently veered off-topic, including discussions of the hosts' personal clutter, the difference between hoarding and collecting, Dr. Zazio's animal phobias, clips from Maury Povich's phobia segments (including the cotton ball man), and the interview's prep sheet. The hosts continually made crude and sexually suggestive jokes, teasing Dr. Zazio.  There was a lengthy digression about Jimmy's unusual dietary habits. The segment ended with promotion of Dr. Zazio's book and Jimmy's comedy shows.

The final segment focused on Sal, a show producer, and the criticism of his promotional materials.  Robin Quivers from the Howard Stern Show called in briefly.  The segment included more listener-submitted songs mocking E-Rock,  mentions of CM Punk and Mick Foley (including analysis of a Mick Foley clip mentioning Amy Schumer), and a call from Bob offering advice for improving Sal's morale.  The segment concluded with Guy Fieri appearing in studio to support Sal and promote his restaurant's charity event for the American Red Cross. The entire segment was marked by informal, combative banter and frequent profanity and vulgar humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6am, and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten egg from Sue.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, we're in every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the grow.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  See?  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  Meh.  See?  All right.  New way to start the show. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, why not?  How the fuck do you start the show?  You just say, hi, everybody.  Hello.  Hi, everyone.  Hello.  Hello there.  Hi.  Anyone have any Tickle Me Elmo jokes, you think?  Elmo, Elmo like these little boys.  What the fuck?  I was on Twitter thinking, you know what?  I'm just not seeing a lot of Tickle Me Elmo jokes.  You'd think people would go there.  Oh, you'd think.  You'd think they would make a Tickle Me Elmo joke on Twitter.  Man, if you're the voice of Elmo, you've got to be pretty squeaky clean, I would think. 
[00:02:30]  They're all creeps.  The guy's the gi, and then he decides, well, if the guy's making accusations, some guy is  making accusations that he was having a sexual relationship with him when he was 16 years  old.  Yeah.  Two young men.  And the Elmo guy's saying, no, man, it was all on the up and up.  Tickle Me Elmo, they say that?  They did that one, yes.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  But he's saying it was all on the up and up.  Elmo like, young boy. 
[00:03:00]  Elmo.  So what, he's taking a little time to try to figure this one out?  Well, yeah, I don't think he's taking time.  I think the fucking children's television workshop people have told him to go lay low.  Well, they made it sound like he wanted time to, you know, to protect his reputation.  Yeah.  They granted him that time off.  Yeah.  They probably said, get the fuck out of here.  If you're proven innocent, you can come back.  Did the FBI uncover this one?  Is it emails between Elmo and young boys? 
[00:03:30]  What the fuck's going on with these old guys and their emails?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  They just sent out these emails assuming that they're not trackable?  It's crazy.  What the fuck's wrong with these people?  Sesame Workshop, it's called now.  Sesame Workshop received a communication from a then 23-year-old man who alleged that he had a relationship beginning when he was 16 years old with Kevin Clash.  Reps for the show said in a statement.  Oh, boy.  So that's our front page today. 
[00:04:00]  That's good.  That's front page news.  Everyone's having fun with the headline, too.  Having a little fun with it.  Yeah.  What was the one that you liked, Jimmy?  It said Nookie Monster.  The Nookie Monster.  Ah, see, because the Cookie Monster.  Yes, and this is the Nookie.  The Nookie.  The Nookie.  And it's for always.  The Cookie Monster song.  I see that.  They went with Nookie Monster.  What about the other paper?  They're too busy covering the...  Petraeus.  Yeah, Petraeus.  Which is a strange story, man. 
[00:04:30]  Very.  They don't have time to freaking look after us, it looks like.  There's more to this than meets the eye, than that's out, than that people are willing to be forthright with.  And you will see.  Details will come out.  I think this goes all the way to the top.  All the way to the top.  They said Holder News since the summer.  That's not right.  I don't believe...  Oh, that Holder's a piece of shit.  I don't believe Obama didn't know.  Come on.  You know, of course he did. 
[00:05:00]  When the FBI...  Come on.  Come on.  When the FBI...  And even if he didn't know, that just goes to show you again how little fucking control  he has over things.  When the FBI...  When the FBI...  You're politicizing this one?  ...is investigating...  No.  No.  I'm realisticizing.  I think there's scandals all over the fucking place, no matter who's in office.  When the FBI is investigating the head of the CIA, and the president doesn't know about  it?  But he knows.  Of course he knows. 
[00:05:30]  End of story.  Well...  He knows.  But he's saying...  They're all saying he didn't know.  They're all going to say they didn't know.  Well, you know what?  No matter who's in that stupid seat.  Then you're caught.  That's lying.  That's fucking lying.  We'll see if they could get to that point.  I bet they do.  But of course Obama knew.  There's no down my mind.  And it's all tied into the Benghazi situation that, you know, Petraeus, head of the CIA,  the CIA was directly involved with what was going on in Benghazi.  Right.  They were getting the information. 
[00:06:00]  Their whole fucking safe house over there was attacked.  And now he doesn't have to testify?  They're like, oh, well, it's okay as long as the agency testifies through, you know,  this deputy or something, the second in command.  No!  The head fucking guy that was there at the time of this terrorist attack should testify  as to what he knew, what happened, how soon he knew that it was a terrorist event, why 
[00:06:30]  people weren't sent it.  And then there he goes, oh, I have an affair.  I'm out and I'm not going to testify.  Fuck you!  So you got a little hope that they kick your boy out of the White House.  First of all, I don't like the term boy.  I'm not saying boy in that way.  Of course you're not.  I know.  I would.  All right.  No, I'm not saying kicked out.  Just another thing on the road to exposing what he is.  I don't get it.  He won the presidency.  He's going to be in there for four years.  Whatever.  Have fun. 
[00:07:00]  But you want to make sure it hurts as much as possible in the next four years?  Give you so moment.  Especially the fact that right after the election, the motherfucker starts wooing the United Nations  about their fucking gun control policy.  And then Feinstein is another fucking piece of shit that starts with assault weapons.  And it's all the unaccountable four year term that he's got going now.  Why isn't...  We had a nice week.  I know.  Back to politics. 
[00:07:30]  Back to it.  Why doesn't he have to testify, though?  Like, I don't understand why.  He might have to.  But why wouldn't he?  He might have to.  He should.  Yeah, he still might have.  He still might.  I don't know why he wouldn't.  But they're going to have to compel him to.  They're going to have to give him a subpoena and make him testify.  All right.  So that'll probably happen.  Yeah, but they shouldn't have to.  This guy should be fucking testifying.  This is such fucking lies.  They're all lying motherfuckers.  I don't disagree with that, sir.  And for somebody supposedly, you know, his transparency and this and that, everybody that's in his fucking surroundings is a piece of shit. 
[00:08:00]  Can I say this much?  I was watching a little of the news because of this story.  And not one newsreader would state the obvious.  Because they're all saying, how could he possibly cheat on his wife?  And I'm screaming at my TV, have you seen what his wife looks like?  Wife is a fucking...  Warren Haynes.  Holy fuck.  I still go with the Michael Moore thing.  No way. 
[00:08:30]  But they're all like, how could he possibly do this?  Of course he did.  Like, man, there's a responsibility.  Yeah.  If you're married, you got to keep your shit together.  You can't start looking like a man and then assume your husband's not going to be, you know, taking peaks left and right.  Exactly.  But no one wants to say that.  Look at this thing.  Oh, that...  She might be a nice lady, but look at this thing.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That hairdo is great.  Is there a picture of what she used to look like before her possible sex change?  You think he wants to come home to that and as a man who obviously enjoys the company of a beautiful woman because he was with one, you think he likes coming home to that and just because he's married to her and just because, you know, the mother of the children, the fucking wife of so many years, that he enjoys kissing that, snuggling up to that? 
[00:09:00]  No!  This is some honest talk right here.  No one else is going to give it to you.  Look at her.  What the fuck happened?  Sorry.  He's in shape.  He's a military guy.  In shape.  She looks more...  She looks more of a man than most of the guys walking around this joint. 
[00:09:30]  What is that?  What happens?  What are you losing your body that you start looking like that?  I don't know.  That estrogen.  You see a bunch of them on the Long Island Railroad on Wednesdays coming in for the fucking theater.  It's that estrogen thing that they lose.  And they start talking like this.  Yeah.  They talk like this.  Oh, yes.  I miss taking the Long Island Railroad on Wednesdays because all these fucking Bettys would come in for the theater and you would look at them and go, who the fuck fucks these women? 
[00:10:00]  These poor motherfuckers.  It's poor guys that can't fucking get out of their marriage.  And I don't want people to get confused.  You can age gracefully.  I'm talking about something else that happens to a certain percentage of women when they get older,  that they really start looking like men.  Put a little work into it, you dummy.  Yeah, he's fucking staying in shape and shitting it.  And she just, oh, I'm a mom and I've been married for many years. 
[00:10:30]  And they just have this assumption that everything's going to be fine and dandy.  But I guess you can't go on CNN and say, well, have you seen, you know, his wife?  But the point is, they all know why he was doing it.  Wouldn't that be funny if one of the news guys just went, well, did you see his wife?  Did you take a look at what he was married to?  Not quite a looker there.  Oh, boy.  The outrage.  The fake outrage.  It would be fake outrage.  Of course.  Because every guy would be able to understand that.  Because, look, you know, you got to have some kind of sexual attraction when you're married. 
[00:11:00]  Is that her?  Is that her?  Or, dang, she was like one of those kind of hippie-ish girls.  Oh, she looks like a...  That's the wife I think I met.  Wow.  She looks like a...  She looks like an old school actress.  Wow, she's all right.  And he looks like Obama.  Petraeus looks like a white Obama when he was younger.  Conspiracy.  Oh, boy.  She was pretty.  Oh, man.  Yeah, a lot of people saying Bruce Valanche or whatever his name is. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, that's another one, too.  I heard Bruce Valanche, Michael Moore.  Teen Wolf Dad.  There was another one in there.  That's pretty good.  Not Chris Farley.  That was too easy.  There was another one people were saying.  Eh, whatever.  It'll pop in my head again.  Yeah.  But this one goes right to the top.  Right to the tippity-top, I think.  The timing is great.  Right after the election, this all comes out.  Of course.  You know how many people were fucking shaking?  And how bummed is Romney that he couldn't undercover this little nugget right before the election?  Oh, this would have been a good one.  But that's all they do is try to uncover another fucking shit that's going on. 
[00:12:00]  Romney somewhere is crying.  Because if this hit just before the election, that would have shaved a few points off.  It might have.  It might have made a little bit of a difference.  It would have shaved a few points off.  Might have.  Every race was close, even in the battleground states.  Even though Obama won them all, they were all very close.  So, you know, you get a scandal like this.  Oh, the other one was Patton Oswalt.  That's right.  That was the other one.  Oh, God. 
[00:12:30]  She does look like fucking Patton.  That's funny.  I wanted to tweet that, but I didn't want to insult our friend.  No, he would know.  Patton, he'd probably go with that.  All right.  I'm going to tweet that.  Then fuck it.  Patton Oswalt.  And it shows you how the FBI and CIA don't work together.  I mean, they hate each other.  Yeah, they've never worked together.  So, again, all these conspiracy nuts that think that all these government organizations can get together and hide everything.  They live to expose each other.  They'd love to get a secret and expose each other.  Yeah, this proves that conspiracy shit in general is bullshit.  You can't even fucking hide an affair when you're in that position, but you're going to hide the whole fucking, you know, Twin Towers debacle. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  Well, you believe what you want to believe.  They were in there with thermite paint and the harp machine.  The harp machine.  Fuck you.  So, what's the latest news on this, though?  The other guy that was in charge of investigating the whole thing was sending pictures, topless pictures.  What the hell's going on?  This thing gets so weird now.  There's so many, there's too many people involved. 
[00:13:30]  It gets, it's so weird, I don't even know how to break it down.  What guy's sending pictures?  I don't know that.  Supposedly the guy that was in charge of the initial FBI investigation was sending topless pictures of himself to the one broad that was threatening the other broad.  Did I get it right?  Broadwell was the one he was seeing, and Jill Kelly is the friend who has a twin sister who apparently portrays, they're just friends, but this one thought that he's banging.  Wait, so they are twins?  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I thought they were just showing two pictures of her on TV last night.  There are so many people, and there's this junior high school jealous girl thing that is the reason that one of the girls was being threatened by another girl, because she was jealous of the fact that she was with Petraeus.  Listen, and it gets so fucking stupid, and you realize that even at the pinnacle of power, that all this bullshit that people go through with emails and texts and sexting still goes on, even in those high levels of power. 
[00:14:30]  Which also shoots down conspiracy theories.  Yes, of course.  These are the same people you and I are.  I know some of them are really devious and black ops and all that shit, but you know what?  When you can send a picture of your dick to a girl, you do.  Yep, that's it.  And it's always been that way.  Yes.  And the older generation, they just don't understand that all this shit is traceable.  Yes.  It really is stupid.  Wiener was, you know, really dumb.  You'd think the head of the CIA would know, like, you know, ah, there's certain avenues I shouldn't fucking venture down. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  I'm sorry, guys.  The guy was sending pictures to the girl, the friend, not the one who he was banging.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I knew that.  It's so, there's so many people involved in this.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Look, your boy Romney blew it.  He should have fucking dug up this nugget.  Oh, please.  It shows that he's not that smart.  They kept it on the wraps.  They kept it under wraps.  All these motherfuckers did.  Yeah, well.  They lied, deceived the public, withheld information pertinent to a murder investigation. 
[00:15:30]  This is fucking stunning.  Isn't Petraeus kind of neutral, though?  Well, he doesn't lean, well, he might lean.  Hey, look.  He probably leans more Republican than anything, right?  If you had a guess.  When you're the boss, you're Barack Hussein Obama, you're the boss.  All these people answer to you.  The head of the Central Intelligence Agency answers to the President of the United States.  The head of the FBI answers to the President of the United States. 
[00:16:00]  And the fact that the FBI is investigating the Central Intelligence Agency, and if Holder  fucking knew, you damn well know Obama knew.  So are you hoping...  Holder doesn't keep shit from that fucking, his buddy, his fucking buddy Obama.  What are you hoping for?  An impeachment?  No.  What are you hoping for?  No.  I don't think...  You got a little hope.  You got a little hope in your eyes.  The country doesn't need a fucking impeachment.  You finally got some of that Obama hope in your eyes.  No, no, no.  You're hoping that he gets his ass fucking kicked out of the White House. 
[00:16:30]  Bad for the country.  We don't need that.  You just want to make it hurt a little bit.  I just want him exposed as the fucking snake oil salesman that him and all of his ilk  are.  Snake oil salesmen.  See all the layoffs happening because of fucking...  The fact that now they know Obamacare is going into effect.  And everybody was holding out hope that maybe if Romney was elected...  They were elected and repealed it.  But now all these companies, Papa John's Pizza and Applebee's and stuff have come out 
[00:17:00]  and said, look, we're going to have to either put a freeze in place on hiring or we're going  to be laying people off.  And now on Twitter, people are running amok going, we got to boycott Applebee's and boycott  Papa John's Pizza because they're against what Obama is putting...  It's like, no, it's a business decision.  They fucking are deciding that they can't afford this shit with the employees they have now  so they're fucking going to lay people off.  And they're not alone.  Boeing laid a fuckload of people off.  So is Obama going to be blind to all this shit, you think? 
[00:17:30]  Of course.  Or is he going to try to work with the other side a little bit?  We've got the fiscal cliff coming up and nothing's going to get done.  It's the automatic...  Tax increases?  Well, the tax increases plus the spending cuts that are going into place.  So you put both of those things together, it could result in another economic downturn  and perhaps another recession.  So what do we do?  Nothing's going to get done because Obama wants to raise the taxes again on the wealthy.  Doesn't understand that's a bad thing, so maybe he'll work with the other side. 
[00:18:00]  No, he won't.  And the other side won't work with him.  Maybe he'll reach across the aisle?  Reach across the aisle.  I love that one.  I want to reach across the aisle.  Half the fucking room loves you, half the hate you, and we're supposed to run a country.  God, we stink!  You don't like the standing ovations during this speech?  Yeah, one side is standing, but one douche always on the other side is like,  you know what, fuck everybody else, I'm going to stand too.  And then he gets browbeat by his fellow fucking Republicans or Democrats,  depending on who the fuck is standing. 
[00:18:30]  Denver Pest says that people like Papa John's and Applebee's,  it's politically motivated bullshit,  and they're so full of shit.  No, it's not.  Well, I could say that about Obama and his fucking lies about Petraeus and his lies about Benghazi.  How about that?  I think that's a little more important, to tell you the truth.  So you don't think Obama, you think Obama's just going to like just plow ahead?  He is adamant about the Bush-era tax cuts being taken off of the wealthy, 
[00:19:00]  being kept in place for the middle class,  and the Republicans are saying, no, they want them left in place for everybody.  You can't during this hard economic time.  I understand all that, but are they going to work together?  Is he going to raise them less than he wanted to initially to work with the Republicans,  or is he just going to plow ahead?  No, he's going to plow ahead.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  And my second question is, how much does that mean for us?  We do fall in that category.  Yeah, yeah.  How much more a year?  I say that whatever increase that we got on our contract deal is gone. 
[00:19:30]  The whole thing?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's a big nut.  It's a big nut.  God, I should have voted for Romney.  I knew it.  It's not just our federal income tax rate that will go up.  Everybody is going to pay.  That's a big nut.  For the Obamacare.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of other taxes going in play that aren't federal income taxes.  Because that was the whole thing.  We're not going to raise taxes on the middle class. 
[00:20:00]  They mean federal income taxes.  But there's a fuckload of brand new taxes on the 1st of January that are going into place for everybody.  Everybody.  We're talking thousands of dollars.  What if you make a household making just under $100,000?  Just under $100,000?  $80,000, $90,000.  You're probably looking at another $8,000 in taxes over the course of a year.  That household?  Yes.  About $8,000 in taxes.  See, that's way more scary than what I got to deal with. 
[00:20:30]  $8,000 is a lot of money to a lot of fucking people.  That's what I'm saying.  I feel worse for those people than how I'm going to get hammered.  Exactly.  Because in the end, I'll be all right.  But I don't see how a middle class family can handle another $8,000 worth of taxes a year.  Good luck.  Because it's all going to be put in play on January 1st.  So how is that helping the middle class?  And there's nothing we can do about it.  How is that helping the middle class?  It's not.  This is all a fucking smokescreen.  For what?  Well, there's the larger vision, which is the smokescreen for Obama to decimate the economy of the United States of America 
[00:21:00]  and bring its power level in the world down because him and his father are against any type of colonialism and capitalism,  which I don't quite go for the entire line on that one.  But it makes people more dependent on the government.  And in order to win elections, the left and the Democrats need a population that is dependent on the government. 
[00:21:30]  But who the fuck is going to vote for the next Democrat if they get walloped with these new taxes?  The people that are getting free stuff.  That horrible 47% that Romney was talking about.  When you get free things from someone, they are your pal.  The way the Democrats know they can stay in power is to keep a population or a segment of the population dependent on that government. 
[00:22:00]  Why would you want to work?  Why would you want the economy to get better and make more jobs so that you have to go out and work  when, in fact, you're just getting free shit?  I'm Obama foul!  So the whole country is going to be run by those people in the end is what you're saying.  Yes, that's where we're going.  That's where we're headed.  I was thinking the other day that humans just stink.  We have figured out how to make life just shitty and miserable.  Suck.  Suck.  When was the last time you had a cool life where you didn't have to worry about, like, feeding your family and working? 
[00:22:30]  I think everybody had that.  No, even in our lifetime, you didn't have both parents working.  In our lifetime, you know, the moms fucking stayed home and had a pretty good life.  They raised the kids and did all right.  But then somewhere along the line, they had to go back to work as well and raise the kids, which is just lunacy.  Yeah.  When was the last time you actually enjoyed your life without all the fucking stress of figuring out how to pay all your fucking bills?  I know.  And everything else that goes along with it. 
[00:23:00]  I was trolling a few websites last night.  Oh, boy.  I may have gone on a site.  It's called niggermania.com.  It's terrible.  You just do it to yourself.  Do those guys use their real names on that site or no?  Some of them do.  They do, right?  Some of them are very proud of their...  Some of them are very proud of their...  In the URL?  But the funniest part is I've been commented on on that site about my viewpoints here on the air.  They say I...  They like some of the things I say, but I'm not strong enough about my views. 
[00:23:30]  You just have one S tattooed on your chest.  When I heard that, I was cracking up.  I'm like, wow, these guys are hardcore, man.  Do they like me on that site?  No, they hate you.  Good.  They hate you.  Fucking Casey.  They hate Opie.  Good.  They hate everybody.  And they tolerate me because I delve into some type of exposure of what's going on in this country. 
[00:24:00]  But they don't feel I go far enough.  Most of those guys are frauds.  The ones who use their real names, you know what?  I'll respect them for saying their opinion and being themselves and saying this is who I am and this is how I feel.  But most of those other guys are just fucking frauds.  Yeah.  Just frauds.  That's why I just went to Stormfront.  Jesus.  Stormfront.org is great.  But, you know, if you get a page like Nigger Mania, they are very focused on one group. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Stormfront's all over the place.  They don't like the Jews, the gays, the blacks, everybody.  They really need to focus.  They need more focus.  But I did like the letter from David Duke saying how he agreed with Stormfront.org's position on the fact that they don't like swastikas on their page anymore.  Do they really take – are they mellowing out a little bit?  No, they think that symbolism prejudices them immediately with people.  And they don't like being tied in with the likes of the Ku Klux Klan and the old school national socialists with the swastika and this blind following of people like Hitler and stuff. 
[00:25:00]  They're more progressive anti-Semites.  Where are they based out of these sites?  Are they all the south or are they not?  I would gather.  What do you like?  Stormfront laughing.  Because there's too many normal threads on this message board like you would expect it to be like, I hate this one, I hate that one.  Here's one.  Dish soap.  Needed or not? 
[00:25:30]  They're talking about after shaking hands with a Jew, though.  Here's another one.  I'm sure if I go –  Now, I'm sure if I go into the thread, who knows what we're going to find.  Sure.  But for the most part, it's just a general funny picture thread.  Like, I'm sure there's going to be kittens in there.  Oh, I bet.  Click on that.  I bet general funny pictures on Stormfront are a little different.  Let's see what they –  Yeah, see, I told you.  It's just regular-ass pictures that you'd find on the internet.  Oh, my God.  Hey, look at that.  Look, a kitty with a Batman.  It's Batman – 
[00:26:00]  Icon thing.  Yeah.  Aw.  You know, these racists are funny.  I said cats.  I took three fucking pictures to get the cats.  Yeah.  The racists love kittens.  Everybody.  You know what?  Everybody.  A cat, too.  How ironic.  Kittens.  Black bear at a picnic table.  That's great.  Yeah, but apparently –  Oh, Jesus.  They show that guy.  I'm sure they don't like him.  What's the next one there?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Oh, that's a chip.  Yeah.  Those are some funny pictures, you guys.  Yeah, so I guess I'm not – I'm not – I guess you're going to have to try harder. 
[00:26:30]  I guess I've got to try a little harder.  You really want their –  The acceptor.  Their approval.  You know, Anthony.  You really want their love.  What are you going to do?  Don't you?  Practice makes perfect.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I would love to know what your screen name is on there.  I don't post.  I don't post.  You can't.  I got to, you know –  You'll have a betray situation on your hands if you post?  I think I should be able to go on any website I want to, post anything I want.  I absolutely think I should.  But with the way things are and my job and stuff, I can't. 
[00:27:00]  Donald Trump was getting some flack from people that didn't want – they were going to boycott Macy's because Macy's is using Donald Trump in one of their Santa Claus ads.  And people were saying they want to boycott Macy's for using Donald Trump because he's racist and sexist.  It's like, you read his tweets, he's got a right to say whatever the fuck he wants.  He's not a racist.  I don't think he's a racist.  Well, you know why?  Because he's against Obama.  Yeah, I understand why you're saying that.  So that immediately puts you in a racist category.  It's stupid. 
[00:27:30]  Sexist?  Sexist because he talks about women's looks.  Right.  And you know from the girls he's married in the past that Donald Trump, it's very important to him to have a beautiful woman on his arm.  He's honest at least about I'm a billionaire and I want hot chicks.  And he calls Rosie O'Donnell a pig.  She's a pig.  They get along these days.  They made up.  Hey, is Macy's backing off or no?  No, Macy said they stand up for his right for free speech.  Well, he's got a new clothing line, I think.  Of course.  I think he's got a few things making their way into Macy's. 
[00:28:00]  Do you think it's about money?  That's why they're sticking with him?  Oh, of course.  It's a big fucking deal, though.  I think those two made with each other.  I bet.  I believe.  If I read it correctly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  So this Petraeus thing.  Yeah.  Confusing.  Confusing.  A lot of fucking players.  And every day, more people are involved.  Which, again, leads me to believe that the more people that get involved, the more fucking  complex the storyline gets, the less interested people are in it. 
[00:28:30]  So the more shit you can throw into this story, the less people are actually informed about  it, which is better for their side because they don't want people actually knowing what  the fuck is going on.  So they confuse the shit out of them.  When you got one guy, you know, we got the Unabomber and he bombs people.  It's very easy.  It's a simple fucking thing where you got 20 different players in this and you don't  even know who's doing what.  Are you exhausted by the end of the day, fighting this fight of yours, fighting this  fight?  I sleep like a baby. 
[00:29:00]  I'm fighting the good fight.  You just use every bit of energy every day.  I'm fighting the fight.  Until you just pass out.  My fucking race war, my fucking political battles, the fucking everything.  Everything.  It's crazy, isn't it?  I was just wandering around a park with my son yesterday, enjoying a beautiful fall  day.  Isn't that great?  I don't even know this stuff was going on.  There's a battle going on out there.  We were collecting acorns and he was chasing squirrels.  I'm at the spearhead. 
[00:29:30]  We were feeding ducks.  Did you see Ronnie Wood?  Ronnie Wood was in Central Park yesterday.  I did not see Ronnie Wood with his young girl.  He's 65.  She's 34.  34?  Did you go outside yesterday?  It was probably the nicest day of the year.  Yes, I did venture out.  It was an amazing day yesterday.  And then it turned really quickly.  Then it started getting windy and cold, right?  Yeah.  But we just wandered around looking at the leaves.  That's wonderful.  It really is.  I'm not even kidding.  That's fucking great.  I was chilled all day. 
[00:30:00]  I took a nice class at our gym.  Did you?  Yes, and I almost vomited.  What?  Really?  I took a class.  I said, let me be, let me be, uh, because I waited for my Sally Field picture.  And my apologies, by the way, too.  Oh, did you get to Sally Field?  I did, and I'm sorry I was cranky about it.  Was she a bitch?  No, she was very sweet.  She was nice, huh?  She has a reputation for that, you know?  I was a bit cranky, but I was overtired, so I apologize.  Did you hear her bones crunching?  Yeah.  Her Boniva bones?  I said to a Boniva, Boniva.  Wait, wait, wait.  I messed up.  There's a couple things going on.  Who are you apologizing to and why?  No, just to the, to roll.  I was never cranky or mean to roll, but I was a little bit cranky, and it was just, I'm 
[00:30:30]  just apologizing in general.  Because you wanted to do Sally Field picture before.  But I was overtired.  You didn't want to wait around for her.  Was she nice?  What did she look like in person?  She looks very good.  She looked really good, man.  She's got to be well into her 60s at this point.  Oh, easily.  So I went to the gym, and I took, I walked in, and I had this ab crunch class for a half  hour.  Oh, my God.  So I said, let me do that.  So I did it, and I couldn't do half the exercises.  I was just laying there.  What was it?  What did you have to do? 
[00:31:00]  High energy ab shit.  Like, you know what I mean?  Oh, my God.  Okay, you're going to put your feet in the air, and you're going to grab a ball.  No, I'm not.  I'll watch you do it.  You're going to do this.  And then left, and right, and left.  You're doing crunches and all this shit.  And then the next class started right away, and it was like this high energy kind of Tony  up class.  So I said, oh, what the fudge?  And I did about half of that, and I had to leave here.  It was a puke.  Oh, don't get yourself so overdone that you get discouraged.  Then I had frozen yogurt last night. 
[00:31:30]  Aw.  Fat-free, right?  Fat-free, but there's sugar in it.  Piggy Boy just can't stop.  No, it's fat-free.  Fat-free, that's a little better.  It's not, though.  It's a Seinfeld episode, sorry.  Hey, I saw Pat Cooper on Seinfeld yesterday.  Yes, he was in the Friars Club in that episode, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, with the jacket.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pat Cooper.  I didn't know he was on Seinfeld.  Yeah, I think everybody's made an appearance at one point or another on Seinfeld.  Yeah, because I was just watching last night, I saw Mimi from the Drew Carey show.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  She had a little cameo.  She was in there.  A bunch of people.  Everybody's been on, I guess.  Yeah.  I saw...  Rob Schneider was on the episode last night, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Same episode, right?  He was deaf.  I guess.  He was supposedly deaf.  I've never understood Rob Schneider.  I'm sorry.  I saw...  What's his name?  The Asian guy from Lost.  Yeah.  What was his name?  Oh, yeah.  He was in Hawaii 502.  Yeah, yeah.  He played...  Not...  Oh, God.  Jane?  No.  It was...  Gin.  It was Gin.  Son and Gin.  Gin.  Yeah, he was in an episode of Seinfeld last night. 
[00:32:30]  I'm like, oh, look at that game.  MTA will not reimburse monthly MetroCard users for time lost during Hurricane Sandy.  Oh, man.  So you couldn't use your card.  They time out those cards, right?  I guess, yeah.  It's the monthly cards.  The monthly.  The monthly, yeah.  So...  Oh, boy.  Of course the MTA did that.  Of course they did.  Oh, it's motherfuckers.  Of course they did.  Sons of bitches.  As they try to find more money from us.  And there's a rate hike going into effect. 
[00:33:00]  Of course there is.  Of course.  Why?  Aren't they fucking cocksuckers?  They can't give you a break on the thing?  What scumbags?  Can't give a break, and they're always broke.  I don't understand that.  Can't give anything back.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  I don't understand.  They're their own agency, by the way.  No one controls them.  They should be investigated at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  By who?  They run the city.  Yeah.  Don't fool yourself.  The MTA runs this fucking city.  They run Barter Town.  They don't give a fuck.  And they're going to just squeeze as much money as they can out of us.  Motherfuckers got us by the purse strings. 
[00:33:30]  And people still without power.  Lipa is really, really taking a beating.  I had them all in my neighborhood last night.  There are a lot of workers, a lot of trucks, a lot of fucking machinery sounds, cherry pickers,  fucking auger drills, plant and telephone poles.  And they finally got the rest of my block online.  I think a lot of people are really pissed not at the linemen and the workers out there.  They're pissed at management for not really saying much of anything.  They have a basic statement on their website, and that's pretty much all they have said since this whole thing went down. 
[00:34:00]  Opie literally and figuratively in the dark.  Yeah.  You know, they don't step up and kind of like explain themselves a little better.  They were telling people with absolutely no power to go online and check on the status.  Well, a lot of people are saying, you're not getting power anytime soon because you've got to fix your house first.  Yeah, that's the new thing.  When they say that there are only, I think, between 30,000 and 40,000 people without power now, lower, 19,000 perhaps, 
[00:34:30]  they're only talking about people that are able to have power.  There's a whole other segment that we're really devastated by the water damage in this storm  that can't have their power turned on because the basic electrical infrastructure in the buildings are destroyed from the salt water.  A lot of these other boxes, the breaker boxes and whatnot, are ripped out of the buildings.  The buildings themselves, the basements flooded so much that the electrical systems were flooded with salt water.  Now that needs to be replaced. 
[00:35:00]  Isn't Travis in that boat?  Travis is in that boat.  Travis doesn't have electricity still.  He's on the fifth floor of a building, so he didn't get any water damage,  but the building itself and the neighborhood got so much damage that they can't turn the power onto his building.  So he's just as fucked as everybody else.  Mr. E-Rock has a statement, too, because he's been in a storm-ravaged, where?  Rockaway.  Rockaway.  Oh, you went out there?  Yeah, that's where all my family is.  The news was out near my brother's place yesterday and said they're at least after Thanksgiving 
[00:35:30]  before they can get power to that area.  How terrible.  Oh, oh, oh, it's Thanksgiving.  We, we, we are gonna have a good time.  The turkey.  Mashed potatoes.  I don't know.  We, we.  What are you singing?  Ugh.  You got another song stuck in your head?  This is, do you remember Friday, Friday?  Well, the producer of Rebecca Black's Friday is apparently, in my judgment, a fucking pedophile 
[00:36:00]  that only gets these tween girls and produces videos for them.  Okay, that's, whoa.  I said in my personal opinion.  Okay, fair enough.  And there's a new one now.  It's a Thanksgiving song.  It's a Thanksgiving song.  It is so, first of all, it's a bunch of little girls and they're jumping around and singing  a Thanksgiving song.  I'm looking at videos with little girls.  No, believe me.  I gotta be on the cutting edge.  I love how he just stumbled on that.  Yeah, I love how he spins the shit.  He's attacking the producer because he's got his dream job. 
[00:36:30]  Of course.  No.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even know about this.  Look.  You just happened to stumble upon this.  What were you watching or fucking searching for?  This will get heat.  But how did you discover it as a-  Someone sent me the link.  As an older gentleman.  Someone sent me the link.  Of course they did.  And said, this is terrible.  Of course they did.  A little chat room.  A little chat room.  No.  A little group you hang out with.  Of course you guys are.  It's called Thanksgiving song.  It's Nicole something.  That's adorable.  You even know her name?  No.  I just know the first name.  I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  But this guy-  You're on the stand, sir.  Look.  They start singing about Thanksgiving.  And then the black guy shows up in the video.  And that pissed you off.  I'm sure.  This has a lot of dislikes on it.  Oh, look at it.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  I want to hear it.  But it has 5 million views.  Yeah.  I'll take a video that has 5 million views with a shitload of dislikes.  Dude.  Sam's.  Any day of the week.  This is the same guy.  It's some black dude.  And he pops into the video.  And it's like, why is there a big black guy in the middle of this video?  Because you were enjoying the little girls in the video. 
[00:37:30]  No.  And then the black guy comes in and ruins it.  We understand that.  We understand.  Look.  It's exactly like the Rebecca Black thing.  Yeah.  It's just such an awful video.  Just saying.  As you're about to come, the guy came in and ruined it for you.  No.  They're even out of my range.  They're a little too young.  Please.  Please.  What are they?  Zygotes?  All right.  Zygotes.  All right.  Let's hit this thing.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, this is terrible.  Sharpie and the pooper tag.  Who writes a song about Thanksgiving also? 
[00:38:00]  It's lovely.  It's not a holiday that's worthy of a song, really.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  Hot, right?  You like that, right?  Come on.  Yeah.  It's the same guy that did the Rebecca Black thing.  Same MO.  That's definitely your type, though.  Oh. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, it is.  It's all right.  It's all right.  It's okay.  It's all right.  Yay.  Having a little party.  Not yet.  Yay.  Uh-oh.  There we go.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is terrible.  As he starts singing about turkey and mashed potatoes. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Get your cranberry sauce.  What the fuck?  You look into the next room.  He's dancing.  Iraq loves it.  Can you pause for a second?  Iraq's pop-locking.  Yeah.  Sorry, Iraq.  We're a minute 30 into this.  I would never still be watching this video.  You watched all the way to the black guy, who still hasn't appeared. 
[00:39:30]  So why are you still watching this?  Wouldn't you hate this within 10 seconds and go, what an idiot for sending this to me?  Don't you understand?  I've watched the entire Rebecca Black Friday video.  You made it through turkeys and potatoes.  You made it through turkey and potatoes.  I want to see if they were going to sing about other treats.  I'm very suspicious.  Stuffed artichokes.  I'm very suspicious why you're still watching this a minute 30 in.  Do they get to the cranberry sauce in the second verse?  No.  I'm stuffing without the raisins.  She was shocked because she didn't know what happened when the cranberry sauce started 
[00:40:00]  leaking down her leg.  Wow.  I was confused.  Mom said it's normal.  Get into the bathroom.  My schoolmates started throwing tampons at me in the shower.  That's not cranberry sauce.  It's a pink sauce.  A lot of people checking in.  How many times did you watch this, you sick fuck?  You're a minute 30 into a video.  You hate it.  I watch a lot of the videos that annoy me.  It's an annoying song. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  My underpants smell like copper.  Confusion and fear.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's a part of becoming a woman.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ken from Connecticut is saying she's 12, by the way.  See, I don't even know that.  All right, let's watch when the black guy comes in, and that's when this was ruined for Anthony.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, nice.  You know, school is out.  I can shout. 
[00:41:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  No matter how you do.  It's terrible.  No matter what you say.  This is my favorite.  This is my favorite.  Oh, there he goes.  What's he doing?  Minute 45 in.  The black guy's just in the, in their house.  He's just doing a world star hip-hop.  World star hip-hop.  He's doing a Shirley Temple guy dance down the steps. 
[00:41:30]  Now all the friends come over.  Yeah.  With various foods.  It's so silly.  We, we, we are gonna have a good time.  The turkey.  Cranberry sauce.  Oh.  We make a wish.  My uncle and father grab my legs and treat me like a wish.  Oh.  Now a rap part.  This is terrible.  Listen to this. 
[00:42:00]  Ew, Danny's like.  Yeah.  Can't be hateful.  Gotta be grateful.  Gotta be grateful.  Can't be hateful.  Yeah.  Gotta be grateful.  Can't be hateful.  Yeah.  Nice.  Smelling up my neighbors.  This guy's eating ribs.  Tonight.  Having good times.  We'd be laughing.  Yeah.  We'd be laughing.  Thanks.  Thanksgiving.  Come on.  It's Thanksgiving.  It's Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Give them Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  Sing it to a drumstick.  She's singing it to a drumstick.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  How do you put turkeys and potatoes in a song? 
[00:42:30]  Daddy sprayed potato flakes on my back.  Cranberry sauce on my thigh.  Aye, aye, aye.  Drumstick in my bottom.  Cranberry sauce on my underpants.  Potato flakes on my back. 
[00:43:00]  Aye, aye, aye.  This is just a big metaphor for being abused.  Aye, aye, aye, aye.  Well, you hated that video, huh?  Dude, that is.  How many times did you watch it?  Honestly.  Honestly, probably three times.  Five million, 2,100.  He just had nine hits when he clicked on it.  I watched it three times because it was being commented on, and I was watching parts that people were commenting on.  Like, why is this black guy in there?  Why in all of his videos? 
[00:43:30]  And he's got a bunch of videos like this with these unknown fucking tweens that are making shit.  And he always puts them barefoot in some scenes.  Every video.  So you had to watch three times to make sure all this was accurate?  I got to watch it three times?  Three times?  To make sure all their feet were pretty.  Right.  To make sure all their little tootsies were in the video.  No, she's beautiful.  She's a 12-year-old girl like that.  They're trying to make another female Bieber.  Exactly.  He's got a fucking farm team.  We already have a female Bieber. 
[00:44:00]  He's got a farm team.  Justin Bieber.  Where is Rebecca Black?  Is she still singing?  Oh, boy.  I've got one.  Over the hill.  She had a couple.  She had a second one.  The second one didn't really hit.  That was a big one.  The second one was a big one, you think?  Where's the second one?  Wait a second.  What was the second one?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Her second one was My Moment.  That's a good one.  Wow.  Holy moly.  What happened?  A few hits?  Yeah.  I mean, way more than I thought there was going to be.  That fucking Friday video, 42 million.  Wow.  That's pretty viral.  But that My Moment thing was fucking 36 million. 
[00:44:30]  Jesus.  I didn't expect that.  Spuds Buckley has it in perspective here.  La, la, la, la, la.  Because it's funny how Anthony has to do more.  It's funny how Anthony has to do more explaining about this video than he did about niggermania.com.  It is true.  We're certainly a bit suspicious, sir.  We're a bit suspicious over here.  Yes.  We know you were jerking off at that one.  We just don't know if you ordered this video.  Oh, this one. 
[00:45:00]  I remember.  We played this as a follow-up just to check it out.  She's singing to the entire country.  Why does she have droopy eyes at 14?  They're sultry.  They're droopy.  She's a nice girl.  Her voice is just short of good.  Something happens in her voice.  Karaoke voice.  Is that what that is? 
[00:45:30]  She's got a good karaoke voice.  Yeah.  You know, MTV doesn't play videos anymore.  When did that happen?  Well, this guy.  I don't really know this one, to be honest with you.  I'm not going to even try to front.  Front.  I saw this going around yesterday.  I didn't have time to click on it.  Yeah, I saw it.  It was pretty funny and pretty accurate as well.  But it's a guy.  He takes the role of the MTV executive.  So he's explaining it to you from that perspective.  Oh, it's a goof.  They haven't played videos in a long time.  But it's extremely accurate.  Or are they playing videos again, sort of?  No, it's not.  But it just answers that tip. 
[00:46:00]  You know, because every person goes, oh, how come MTV has played videos?  And like, it's still something that happens.  Now it makes sense not to play them.  Because now everyone just goes online to check out their videos.  Yeah, that gets explained.  It makes sense.  But for a while, there was like stupid that they completely blew it off.  And I just wonder, why don't you play music videos anymore?  Thanks, Natalie.  Dear Natalie, are you f***ing kidding me?  Should we all preserve your precious sleepover moments spent watching promotional material  from record labels in amber, like the mosquitoes in Jurassic Park? 
[00:46:30]  The answer is f*** you.  I'm going to break it down for you and every other person born before 1995, otherwise known  as not our f***ing demo anymore.  So we can all finally put this behind us.  Yes, back in the day we earned our brand credibility by breaking new artists, but music videos were  only worth making if they had actual promotional power behind them.  And the game has changed.  Your generation, not the one before you, not the one after you, your generation decided  to steal music. 
[00:47:00]  And music videos are more worthless than ever before.  Puff Daddy used to be able to drive a speedboat through an explosion.  At least that looked cool.  Now you're lucky you can make it through some dire piece of s*** video.  without a character checking their hot new iPhone for three seconds at a concert.  Surprise, that gaudy, blatant product shot is the only reason that video got funding in  the first place.  Why bother otherwise when you can build an avid Twitter following for free?  Before I continue, I just want to reiterate, it's your generation that stole music and  it's your generation that's f***ing about us not playing music videos anymore. 
[00:47:30]  Okay, alright, moving on.  But MTV, where can I go to hear hot new music from my favorite artists?  Oh, I don't know.  How about the most empowering informational tool since the printing press, aka  the internet?  You subscribe to their Twitter feeds, you follow them on Facebook, you trust a computer algorithm  like Pandora to tell you what new artists you should listen to.  And you can watch your music videos again and again and again on YouTube.  Build a f***ing playlist if you're so inclined.  Are you seriously not sick of your favorite artists yet?  Do you have such a lady boner for Mumford & Sons that you need to see them tumbling out 
[00:48:00]  of one more screen in your house?  If we played music videos today, here's what we'd be forced to play.  Katy Perry, Owl City, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Carly Rae Jepsen.  We might as well change our name to iTunes Music Store TV and you'd complain that we don't  play enough Pavement, REN, and Nirvana.  Which brings me to my final point.  Admit it.  You're getting older.  And you're afraid.  Soon, you'll be totally irrelevant to pop culture.  Phased out.  Soon you'll get married and have kids.  Develop totally new interests relevant to their survival and happiness. 
[00:48:30]  When you want to cut loose for a night out, you'll hire a babysitter.  Check silly old antiquated Google for showtimes and realize no movie looks good to you anymore.  Worst of all, your favorite artists will charge an arm and a leg for their comeback tour tickets  and they're going to look really old on stage.  That is if they don't already.  So you toss out that old chestnut as a hip form of rebellion against the man.  Why doesn't MTV play music videos anymore?  And here's the kicker.  That complaint is literally old enough to drive a car by now. 
[00:49:00]  Oh.  And to answer your question about why we only air horrible reality shows about vapid people.  Because you watch that sh** to feel superior.  Go ask the mirror why you watch it.  I don't give a sh**.  Now if you'll excuse me, I have a check to write myself.  Now who was that?  Hi, is this the check office?  Oh.  I'd like to write a check to myself.  Who was that?  Like a whole sh** ton of money.  I gotta find his name.  Brian Fierzy, I think.  What does he have to do? 
[00:49:30]  Does he have anything to do with MTV or was it kind of a parody?  No, it's just a parody thing.  It's just a parody thing.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, he broke it down though.  Is anybody young complaining about music videos?  That's the only people who are older.  No one 20.  They don't even play videos anymore.  No, I mean everyone said that for, what, probably 10 years.  But now no one really says that anymore.  No.  Yeah, he references it.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was well done, man.  I don't even know what they air on MTV anymore.  I have no idea.  What reality shows?  16 and Pregnant, I guess.  Oh, that's on there?  I've watched that.  I just, yeah, I can't be bothered to know. 
[00:50:00]  I don't even know what they air, but they were able to-  Well, Jersey Shore's on MTV.  Oh, of course, Jersey Shore.  Yeah.  They were able to survive.  Yeah.  Their whole programming was based on just playing videos and somehow they figured out how to  survive through that.  No one's going to talk about them anymore at this point though.  I mean, they're still relevant, but not nearly as much.  Yeah, I'm tired of fucking Yo MTV raps, right guys?  Eh?  I never even heard of this.  At a boy ant.  8th and Ocean, have you ever heard of that?  Yes.  What is that?  No.  Yeah.  16 and Pregnant, a double shot at love. 
[00:50:30]  Nope.  The Big Ten.  Nope.  Bully beat down.  Nope.  I wouldn't recognize one of these people.  There's a talk show going on.  They're walking around the streets of Manhattan.  Nikki Glaser's a comic, she's hosting a talk show I think with someone else.  Ooh.  Starting.  At least they're trying a different format.  Yeah, that'll be cool to watch.  Wow.  I like the Nikki Glaser.  Was Jon Stewart on MTV years ago?  Oh, fuck yeah.  That was his show.  Him and Howard Feller was inside.  And now he's just a wild and crazy guy.  Look out!  Look out!  High energy! 
[00:51:00]  Wild!  Crazy!  What happened to him?  Jon Stewart?  He's very talented, don't get me wrong, but fuck.  Yeah.  It's tough to watch.  I was never a Daily Show guy.  Like ever, ever.  But sometimes it's just on and like I'll sit there for a few minutes and like...  He's going to take a nap after he watches, like relax a little bit.  Because he yells a lot.  He's all just...  Yeah.  He's changed a lot.  We get it.  Obviously he's a huge hit for Comedy Central, but my God, that's not the same Jon Stewart.  Show a video clip of something, you know, right wing, conservative or Republican, and 
[00:51:30]  then come back to this shot of you at the desk just staring at the camera horrified.  Oh, we get it.  Oh, God.  Then move your hands a lot.  Oh, Jesus.  Right.  He's kind of a clown now.  But it's working, so what the fuck?  Yeah.  Good for him.  Yeah.  I'm hungry.  Let's fucking eat something.  Why don't you go eat or something?  Oh, Chippa.  I'm going to work on my song.  Oh, no. 
[00:52:00]  What song, Chippa?  It's a new love song.  What is it?  Is it from Sick Fucking Puppies or your solo act?  Solo project.  Oh, Chippa's got a solo project.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How does it go?  I can't believe I never noticed how pretty you are standing there looking all pretty  and shit.  I can't believe I never noticed how pretty you are standing there looking all pretty  and shit.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  He's so horny. 
[00:52:30]  Sirius XM.  Have you ever wondered how much hot piss your body produces over the course of your entire  life?  How many pounds of dead smelly skin will you shed into your mattress?  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my quest for knowledge and discovery, seeking answers to the questions that man has  pondered since the dawn of time.  On today's episode, how many farts would it take to fill a hot air balloon?  Hot air balloons come in different shapes and sizes, but the average standard balloon takes 
[00:53:00]  65,000 cubic feet of air to lift it.  After squeezing and sharding some numbers, it seems the average human flattus release measures  62 milliliters.  That translates to .0022 cubic feet per fart, or as I like to call them, cubic farts.  That figures out to 29,545,455 farts.  To put that in a warm, moist perspective, all of Australia can fart inside the balloon with  enough room for all of Austria to cut one too. 
[00:53:30]  Unfortunately, a fart is mostly nitrogen, and while it is 3% lighter than air, it's simply  not enough to lift that balloon.  That myth is busted.  But that doesn't mean we still can't fill shit up with farts.  Well, not fill shit up with farts.  I don't even know how that would work anyway, and the shit smells bad enough.  Why would anybody want to put farts inside shit?  Anyway, if you did want to fuel flight with farting, we would need thrust.  The average fart generates roughly .2 Newtons. 
[00:54:00]  If you weighed 180 pounds, just budging you off the ground would take 800 Newtons.  We would need upwards of a half million liters of fart, or 8,064,516 farts.  And finally, the average human produces about a half liter of farts every single day, so  that's one pint glass full of fart every single day, man or woman.  I am buzzed already. 
[00:54:30]  Join us next time on an all-new How Much.  I hear the music.  It gets into you.  I hear the music.  Millions of watts.  All of this low-level sound, well, it gets into you.  And so I said, well, you know what?  I hear the music.  Bring back the music.  All of this music.  Well, you know what?  I hear the music.  And so I said to him, I said, bring back the music.  And he said, excuse me. 
[00:55:00]  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  And so I said to him, I said, wait a minute, I hear the music.  Wait a minute.  I hear millions of watts.  And so I said to him, I said, you all talk a big thing.  You only talk it.  You don't walk it.  And he said, excuse me.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my fucking mouth.  Don't put fucking words in my mouth. 
[00:55:30]  Fucking don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Millions of watts going up into the ionosphere.  You hear it through the front of your skull.  I hear millions of watts.  You hear it through the front of your skull.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Hot.  Sicker than your average.  Pop a twist.  Cabbage on instinct. 
[00:56:00]  Niggas don't think shit.  Stink.  Pink gators.  My Detroit players.  Tim's for my Hoonigans in Brooklyn.  Dead right.  Hit the head right.  Biggie there.  A night.  Pop a been smooth since days of under rules.  Never lose.  Never choose to.  Bruce Cruz who?  Do something to us.  Talk goes through us.  Do it.  You like the biggie?  Screw us.  Screw us.  Biggie's pretty fucking fly, yo.  I like the biggie.  Don't know much about the biggie, but when I hear his voice I like it.  I know he's dead. 
[00:56:30]  Dead as a doorknob.  Unfortunately.  Why are we playing the biggie, E-Rock?  Because it's a good song.  Yeah, of course it is.  It reminds me of E-Rock.  Biggie.  Biggie.  Biggie.  Yeah.  What's that little fucking guitar thing from? 
[00:57:00]  Bam, bam, bam.  What song is that?  What that was sampled from?  Yeah.  Help me out, yo.  I don't think he sampled anything.  Nah.  Herb Albert's Rise.  Is that where it's from?  Alright.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Alright.  He would know.  He knows that shit.  Oh, Connecticut.  What?  Big fucking... 
[00:57:30]  If you live in Hartford, Connecticut, maybe.  No, he just knows music.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Let me hear the Herb Albert now.  What was Herb Albert's big hit?  Herb Albert...  Tijuana Brass?  Where's that...  Okay.  Yeah.  It'll be in there somewhere.  Yeah.  Herb Albert. 
[00:58:00]  You like this stuff?  This shit wasn't bad.  Some of this fucking...  Herb Albert.  They had some jazz in the bathroom this morning.  Ugh.  You like the jazz.  Hate the jazz.  Did this kick in?  Ah, remember this?  Oh, this song.  This is...  Used on many fucking...  TV sports programs and stuff. 
[00:58:30]  For what?  I don't know.  It's just one of those go-to songs.  Yeah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah.  No, no, no.  What am I doing?  Ah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:59:00]  I wish I could do this on The Pan Flute but I'm still practicing.  Oh, you didn't bring that in.  I get so dizzy playing that pan flute.  Well, you're supposed to bring it in.  I'm terrible at it.  I can't get a good consistent sound.  I get notes, and then I just get...  It's so hard to actually play.  You've got to bring it in.  I will bring it in, yes. 
[00:59:30]  Bring it in tomorrow.  Yes, tomorrow I debut the pan flute.  I'm trying to do a chariots of fire.  But bring it in, and we can see how you progress with the whole day.  Progressing.  Oh, good idea.  Because the first time you play, you're going to be out of breath in 30 seconds.  That would be funny for everybody.  Is that getting dizzy?  Well, the dizzy's not fun.  Hyperventilating.  You want to get goofy for about 20 minutes?  All right.  It's E-Rock Jingle Day.  Oh, nice.  E-Rock Jingle Day.  E-Rock Jingle Day. 
[01:00:00]  All dedicated to our favorite E-Rock, E-Rock.  Well, we're in the middle of our ONA audio slash jingle contest,  thanks to IHateStevenSinger.com.  We've got $2,000 up for grabs.  And we've noticed that a lot of people are focusing on E-Rock with their audio.  Yeah.  And we wanted to put together a little E-Rock Jingle Day, and we got it.  It's today.  And you wanted maybe a separate prize, right?  Yeah.  Did we get a separate prize?  Maybe if you think one is higher than the others, maybe we have something. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, really?  All right.  Well, a lot of people know this one.  Feet up on the board like I run the show.  Hoagie in my mouth.  Hoagie in my mouth.  E-Rock.  Army nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Army nigga.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  There you go.  It's loud.  Now, also, don't forget, all of these are eligible to win the main contest. 
[01:01:00]  So someone could come away with, like, two Emmys.  Well, yeah.  I mean, you could, sure.  One Emmy's good enough, but you get the one, then you go, you want?  Let's get another one.  Imagine somebody winning both.  That's crazy.  There's a strong possibility of that, by the way.  Man.  Because then, of course, this is right up at the top of the list.  One of the jingles that's in the lead right now, and it's another E-Rock one.  This is Zeps.  Cake and pie and chocolate and sweets.  That is what E-Rock likes to eat. 
[01:01:30]  All for himself, he ain't sharing a bit.  That's why he has tits.  He's a fat piece of shit.  That's my favorite, by the way, in the entire contest.  That's more of a jingle.  Yes, it is.  That's more of a jingle.  The other one's a song.  That's more of a jingle.  But then we figured out it's an ONA audio contest.  Yeah, you can't really just take jingles.  A lot of people like the army nigga.  Yeah.  But I'm more of a fan of Zeps' tits.  That is a good one.  That's why we put it to a vote.  Democracy.  Yeah.  In the end, Zeps.  It's between the three of you.  And then this is another one we've played a few times that people might remember, and 
[01:02:00]  it's another one about E-Rock.  Eric is a dummy.  Stole some pictures from Opie.  He has a child's mentality.  Can't go an hour without eating.  Some think he rock his brain less. 
[01:02:30]  I say retarded at best.  Now go to break, you dirty hooped, fat fuck.  Go to break so he can have his good lunch.  There you go.  Right?  What was that, by the way?  That was Lucas Hunting.  Lucas.  So we got new ones about E-Rock. 
[01:03:00]  New ones.  I want to hear these.  I hope they're complimentary, Eric.  Oh, I hope so.  We start with Daniel Roberts as we do E-Rock Jingle Day.  I want to eat like E-Rock.  Rock, rock.  Like E-Rock.  Rock.  Like E-Rock.  Rock.  Rock.  Like E-Rock.  Word on the street is the fatty.  He really likes to eat.  Bountiful.  Plentiful.  Casseroles and beef.  Chocolate treats.  Lumpy subs.  His mom works overtime. 
[01:03:30]  Come on, piggy choke it down.  Dinner bell.  His favorite sound.  Fat boy teats.  Double teats.  It's a horror show.  Coke, Coke cup.  Fills it up.  Pours it down his throat.  Spicy wings.  Greasy spots.  On his toy.  Legos.  Come on, piggy choke it down.  London broil.  His favorite town.  Jeez.  He wants the cheese dripping.  Greens popping.  Finger licking.  Sugar frosting. 
[01:04:00]  He wants the chest grabbing.  Heart stopping.  Brain clogging.  Glucose shocking.  Are you great enough to try to eat like E-Rock?  If you try it, then you're going to need a feed trough.  Buy new clothes.  You'll never take the weight off.  Come on, piggy choke it down.  Make your belly fat and round.  That took a lot of work. 
[01:04:30]  Comments.  Oh.  Very good, man.  That's Daniel Roberts.  You like these E-Rock?  These are great.  Was that actually someone singing or was that a computer voice?  That's computerized.  Oh, yeah.  Is that Siri?  Computerization.  A little Siri shit.  And then we got the next one from Ryan Hanson, it looks like.  Yes.  Yes. 
[01:05:00]  He rocks it.  Okay.  He sits in the office all day long, snacking and slacking and singing his song.  All the little kids on Baby Boy Street love to see you rock, just eat, eat, eat, chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny. 
[01:05:30]  Chubby bunny.  There you go.  There you go.  You like that one, he rocked?  Sure.  Why aren't you enjoying this?  It's a whole day dedicated to you.  That could have been better, by the way.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, you kind of.  It was a good concept.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Want to try Matt Lewis?  Rainy.  Here's his E-Rock audio.  Oh.  Oh, no. 
[01:06:00]  I don't know how many of these I got.  E-Rock's the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur.  He eats everything.  Why do you think he's fat?  He rocks the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur.  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  He stops and eats some food.  He's always in the mood.  He stops and stuffs some food while he's found. 
[01:06:30]  He stops and eats some food, and then he takes a snooze.  He stops and eats some food, then he sleeps at the board.  He rocks the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur.  He eats everything.  Why do you think he's fat?  He rocks the size of a dinosaur, dinosaur. 
[01:07:00]  He eats everything.  His belly's not flat.  His belly's not flat.  At least it ends hilariously.  Do you know that as this play, I'm thinking, when E-Rock, like, see, he comes and snaps and kills people.  Yeah.  Like, he can't take it anymore.  They'll be playing clips of that, like, and it was songs like this.  Led to his outrage.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you gotta admit, that was pretty clever.  That one. 
[01:07:30]  It was well done.  That's it?  Yes.  Why don't you like the attention, man?  You're unappreciative.  Yeah.  All these people working hard, trying to, you know.  Better your life.  Better your life.  Do you think it's because Eric's very vague and these songs are not?  I don't know, man.  What's your deal, man?  These people are working hard for you.  Next one is from Steven Gajorik, it looks like.  I eat until I swell, don't care about my health, sneak treats and I'll never tell, eat everything 
[01:08:00]  in my way.  I'd sell my soul for a cake, burgers and fries with a shake.  I've been waiting for this, eat everything in my way.  That was barely home, fan fiction, fan show, hot wings, farts are blowing.  Come and roll my food with gravy.  Hey, my name's Eva, fat and lazy, what's my cholesterol, about 280? 
[01:08:30]  Ping the fountain, you fucking piece of coffee.  What's my cholesterol, about 280?  That's pretty funny.  E-Rock, why aren't you laughing?  I like that line.  I'm enjoying these.  Oh, good.  Then let's play more.  Yeah?  Are there more?  I've been in the room with Eric because I've been doing calls.  Yeah.  I've just been giggling alone in there.  I've been like. 
[01:09:00]  No one is in there sharing your enjoyment?  It's so quiet in there.  You aren't enjoying these.  I've been giggling the whole time.  He just keeps looking over at me and going, Sam, this is not helping.  Which one do you like so far?  I really like the dinosaur one because I like the part where he says, why do you think he's  fat?  Yeah, that's a good one.  And I like the first one, not the first one, maybe the one right before it.  The one that was really just like mean, like it wasn't even really well done, but it was  like super mean.  Which one?  With the Siri voice? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, with the Siri voice.  That's it.  When he said this isn't helping, did he mean you or was Dr. Atkins standing behind you?  Sorry, Rick.  I don't mean that.  Well, let's do, let's try, lots of cheese from, Mike Boyleau, Boyleau, how do you say  a fucking B-O-I-L-E-A-U name?  Boyleau.  Baloo.  All right, it's quick.  Baloo.  Oh!  Hey, you asked for all of them. 
[01:10:00]  That's just mean.  I said you asked for all of them.  They're not all going to be home runs.  We did all right.  That was the first fucking dud.  I don't like my friend Eric being spoken about, so.  Yeah.  Shouldn't stop saying things.  Impolitely.  Oh.  Let's try Sean F.  Let's see if he has a good one.  Let's do this one.  Oh, you like this one?  If it's the one I think you're going to play, I do.  I think it's creative.  Yeah, he's the one who loves garlic butter sauce. 
[01:10:30]  And he writes his fan fiction.  And he does no work at all, but he loves to fucking eat.  Loves to fucking eat.  And I said, he's the one who loves garlic butter sauce.  And he writes his fan fiction.  And he does no work at all, but he loves to fucking eat. 
[01:11:00]  Loves to fucking eat.  And I said, Nago.  Nago.  That's good.  That's a good one.  Which song is that?  Nirvana.  Nirvana.  In bloom.  E-Rock, you gotta like that one.  That one was good.  A lot of work put into that one, man. 
[01:11:30]  Just awkward.  He's not giving us much.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  I said it was very well done.  Stop sloughing off in there.  Really, man.  Is that what he does?  He sloughs?  He's sloughing off.  They're trying to get your love, and you're just fucking shutting him down, man.  He's not making this fun, Sam.  I can't understand it.  This is not fun if he just sits there.  Yeah.  I was belly laughing in that one.  When he said he does no work at all, that's some clever writing. 
[01:12:00]  I'm in there belly laughing, and there's not a peep to be heard out of Eric.  People are loving this, but E-Rock's fucking taking the energy out of the room.  It's mind-boggling.  Let's try Ron Roof.  It's the E-Rock Jingle Day.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Jam.  Jam.  Jam.  Big jam tits. 
[01:12:30]  Jelly.  Big jelly tits.  Tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jelly tits.  Tits, tits, tits, tits.  Big jam tits.  Big jelly tits.  Tits, tits, tits, tits.  What now?  What now? 
[01:13:00]  I'm fucking crying.  That's a good one.  E-Rock, come on.  Now you're in, right?  Now the talent's making its way to the top.  Now he's leaning way back in his chair.  He's not even laughing.  That can't end well.  Jeez, poor chair.  I know.  You hear the effort those guys put into that?  That's a good one.  Or maybe one guy.  E-Rock, comment.  Jammer jelly.  E-Rock.  E-Rock. 
[01:13:30]  He's leaning back in his chair and it's a metal chair.  Why won't he say anything?  E-Rock.  You want to laugh, right?  It was very well done.  I love that one.  It's just so funny watching E-Rock in there because he's silent.  And this is absolutely psychological torture on somebody.  To just play song parodies at them for like an hour about how fat they are is like...  Like that's the type of thing you put Abu Nazir through, you know?  Is he debuting a show this weekend on the channel? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Bagel and with the Sex premieres.  Oh, Bagel and with the Sex.  6 p.m. Eastern on Saturday.  Is this a one and done or is this going to be off and on, E-Rock?  This is a one and done.  And what are you going to talk about?  You don't want to ask.  You don't know?  I do know, but I was critical of it yesterday on the after show.  What are you going to talk about?  I'm going to talk about the new Call of Duty Black Ops, some video game stuff, some stuff 
[01:14:30]  involving Hurricane Sandy, and a couple other things.  When are you getting it?  Probably when it comes out.  So you're going to talk about before it gets out already.  Oh, it comes out today?  It came out at midnight.  So you'll be able to play it before you're big.  It was fucking Roland.  Uh-oh.  If they don't give me my game, I'm bashing the company.  I've noticed that works with things.  All right.  Another E-Rock jingle.  Oh, thank God.  More audio.  Matter of fact, this is Bagel and with the Sex intro that David Kennedy came up with. 
[01:15:00]  Will you be using this one, E-Rock?  I don't know.  Production's not up to me.  Fatness.  Before we move on, we're talking about E-Rock.  Fatness.  Fatness.  It's been brought to my attention that E-Rock fatness on December 28th.  Puffing pizza.  Puffing pizza.  Puffing pizza.  Two garlic butter songs.  My favorite.  My favorite.  My favorite. 
[01:15:30]  Wait, that doesn't make sense.  Wait, that doesn't make sense.  Wait, that doesn't make sense.  Let me have a beautiful sandwich.  Make it fast.  I'm on a goddamn murder.  You're listening to Bagelding with Sex.  Perfect.  Bagelding with the Sex.  You gonna use that intro? 
[01:16:00]  No.  It's produced very well.  It is produced very well.  Everyone's begging to play that last one again.  I mean, it was acapella.  That's a lot of talent.  Maybe we'll go to break with that one.  Well, yeah, you know what?  Danny didn't hear it.  Yeah, I didn't hear it.  Oh, you didn't hear it, Danny?  No, I was out.  Oh, Danny.  You know what?  I gotta play it for Danny.  E-Rock loves the Opie and Anthony show, obviously.  And that last one was obviously a takeoff on the intro that you guys play.  Maybe that should be the intro for Bagelding with the Sex. 
[01:16:30]  Or at least what he comes into.  Maybe we do an intro and then defend it.  Let me play a few new ones and then we're going to play that one again so Danny could hear it.  Share.  That would be nice.  This is Ben Perez with his E-Rock jingle.  E-Rock is a dinosaur marching, marching.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  How did he get so fast?  E-Rock is a dinosaur marching, marching.  Why is he saying it that way?  The best. 
[01:17:00]  Take up a little piggy boy and fucking take us out.  I like the way he says dinosaur.  Dinosaur.  You know what was frustrating about being in there with E-Rock too?  I don't even know if he's picking up on the nuances.  Because the last one that was a parody of that, that was E-Rock's as big as a dinosaur.  Right.  And why do you think he's fair?  Right.  I think that one's a little better.  Right.  But I pointed out to him, dinosaurs are notoriously just huge creatures.  And he still didn't get it.  I don't know why he wants to learn that thing.  I don't know what an asshole.  They ruled the earth. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  They were so big.  I mean, they ate full-sized creatures for lunch.  Yeah.  We got another one from Sean F.  He was the one that did Nagel and Bloom.  Oh.  He did this one as well.  Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of size and weight  Worked in radio for a long, long time But my skills are far from great  Write fan fiction and I hate my job Cause they make fun of my shape 
[01:18:00]  Had to stay home after Sandy left  Cause a branch blocked my escape  I'm an asshole  Won't you guess my name  Oh yeah  I've been known as sex bagel  And I don't watch sports at all 
[01:18:30]  Food, food  I bring nothing to the table  I love garlic  Butter sauce  So if you see me  Show some sympathy  Cause I don't count  Calories  I shouted out  Who broke the toilet seat  When all the while  I knew it was me  I'm an asshole 
[01:19:00]  Won't you guess my name  I like Sean F., man  That's a good one  Kid has skills  That is a good one  Sean F., send us some other shit, man  He didn't adhere to the song very well  But it didn't matter at all  Of course it doesn't matter  Not at all  The comedy's there  I really like when they take shots  They don't just go for fat jokes or whatever  They just go out and say  He's an asshole  So mean  I'm an asshole  I'm an asshole  You rocked it, Sean F. has something 
[01:19:30]  Don't you think?  It was very good  Were you laughing?  Yeah  No he wasn't  I was watching  He was not  No he's just trying to  He's just trying to be one of the guys right now  I'm gonna go sit in the room with him again  And say that he was laughing when he's not  No?  Keep his mic on  So I can hear you in there, Sam  And then we got Josh Howell  As we continue  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  Needs a setup  This one's really good  This one had all of us in the office laughing 
[01:20:00]  Really?  Last week, yeah  Could be a contender  It's done very well  We're doing a side prize, you know  $500, I'm hearing  From Steven Singer  For the best E-Rock jingle  You know Opie and Anthony  And little Jimmy Norton  Travis, Sal and Danny  Roland, Troy and Sammy  But do you recall 
[01:20:30]  The most morbidly obese one of all  E-Rock the shit  Dick fat fuck  These are lazy  Bees of shit  And if you ever saw him  You'd know him by his huge bitch tits  All of the other assholes  Laughing call him piggy boy  They never let poor E-Rock 
[01:21:00]  Have his hoagies  And his shitty toys  That is so mean  So good  E-Rock, these guys love you, man  This is all love  Wow, man  Sam, what do you think? 
[01:21:30]  I'm crying in here  E-Rock did not like that at all  Through your tears  E-Rock, you didn't like this one  Not one of my favorites  Laughing  It's so Christmassy  Yeah  Boy, we have an opportunity  To play that a lot  We sure do  Very smart  Yeah  We sure do  It's a very smart  Very smart entry  Now here's our  Here's our dilemma  We have others  That we've already played  Should we replay  Any of those, Travis?  Uh, I think you're alright  But then we have a line 
[01:22:00]  That was drawn  To me  We do have others  But Travis thinking  They might not be worth  Playing on the air  But I'm thinking  Maybe we should try  Well, you know what?  Because you can always  Go back  Are we going to blow this out?  No, you can always  Go back to the one  That Danny missed  Yeah, I missed it  Yeah, we're going to  Replay that for Danny  So, you know  You want to try a couple more?  If you go down  The slippery slope  That's the ones we've heard  Though  That's racist  Is the problem  What do you think?  Want to try?  Uh, if they're not up to  Oh, boy  I love that reindeer one  How about the snuff?  That's a good one  How about we do this? 
[01:22:30]  As soon as you hate it  Just fucking  We'll just turn it off  Alright, good  Got it  And we'll zip through  A few more of these  To see if there's  Maybe another golden nugget  In here  Yes  This is, uh  Turtle Thomas  We'll turn it off  As soon as we hate it  He is the swine man  Friend of old B  Swine man, okay  And he drives the sandwich road 
[01:23:00]  That makes no sense  Searching in the kitchen  For another  Oh, gee, low  That couldn't even make sense  But it's funny  And I feed him  More than want to  And I want you  To go blind  What?  And the O-N-A swine man 
[01:23:30]  Who looks back from behind  Point off the line man  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You sang the other day  I'll give him topicality  On the song  But, um  Execution  Not very good  But there was a laugh  Or two in there, you know  Yeah, one laugh  At the end  We didn't turn it off  No, we didn't  As soon as you hate it  We turn it off  I'm gonna see where it went  This is John Wan  Wake up

[01:26:00]  A little bit  Huh?  It's really uncomfortable  I don't know how much that says for the Violent Femmes  Yeah  Oh well, you know  I don't think they're as great as everyone else says  I like one song  I like a couple of their songs  That's about it  He was in good spirits at the beginning of this  I mean, not like great spirits  But at least he was like  Okay, I'll just get over with this  Yeah  He's pissed  Why are you pissed, E-Rock?  Why?  What the fuck?  I'm not pissed  I'm enjoying this  He's not  He's not  Don't let him trick you  You're here to say he's not  No, he's not enjoying it  It was very uncomfortable

[01:29:30]  That's when he decides  To look at bikini girls  Yeah, that's what I heard  Is that true of E-Rock?  Uh, sure  See what I mean?  He's not gonna give us anything  Not very happy  I hate this version of E-Rock  Well, what?  The version of  I just played insults about you  For the last 25 minutes  And now you're psychologically beaten down  But he just shuts down  Yeah  I don't like this version of him  When he just shuts down  Sam is laughing so hard  That he's crying  I know  Yeah, I mean, no  These are really well done pieces  It's the writing  That really does it  Keep going  It's up to you guys

[01:32:00]  Like, morbidly obese person  Like, the fattest person  In the world  No  Songs say so, though  Right  He's just  I mean, he's larger than your average  He's not even close to being  The fattest guy that works here  No  Fattest guy on the show, though  Well  Maybe  I don't know  What do you mean, Sam?  No  Either E-Rock or Roland, right?  Roland's bigger than E-Rock  You think so?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  I would say so  Maybe Roland just carries it better  You think?

When he glances downward  He cannot see his balls  That fat, dumb, and blonde kid  Sure can inhale mayonnaise  Oh  Not good  Oh  That was good  Chip, you like that one?  That was good  Chip liked it  Yeah, it was hot  That was really bad  Fucking cooking  That was a bad one  That was just bad  Yeah  And that guy has a Twitter account

Here's producer Dan  All right 
[01:34:30]  We're running out of energy  I say we keep going  These are pretty good  Yeah  We got one more  Actually, we got one more  And then we gotta, like, figure out a winner  The good ones make up for the bad ones  E-Rock should have to pick the winner, I think  Yeah  Yeah  That's a good point  Mr. E-Rock  Up in the pig  Take us out, you fucking  Bacon-making bag of shit 
[01:35:00]  All right  All right  I liked where that was going  That was Tim Allen  I liked it, but I didn't like you talking  Through the whole thing  All right  This is what I say we do  We'll take a break  We'll figure out which are the contenders  You want to go to break  With  Or do you want to save that for later  All right  It's your show  All right  Yeah, because Danny didn't hear it  I want to hear it  So this is one of the contenders, absolutely  And we got to figure out the other contenders  And after the break 
[01:35:30]  We're going to play the contenders  They're all relatively quick  And then E-Rock  You have to decide the winner today  For the $500  Is that cool?  Sure  All right  He's not happy  You don't think so?  No way, he's definitely not  Why not?  I don't know  He's just been  He's been in a bad mood  For most of this segment  That's too bad  Eric  He's raining on our parade  Yeah  Yeah  Come on  Let us at least have fun  Sweating on our parade  We're going to break with this  This is the one Danny missed  Yeah, I agree  It's called  Hoagie Biting Man  By Ron Roof

He puts his feet in their actual hoagies that he's taped up.  Yes.  He drives a hoagiemobile.  Car runs on vinegar and oil.  Coming this winter.  Hoagie boy's enemy is not kryptonite.  It's an expiration date. 
[01:37:30]  And sometimes he eats it and gets all sick and shitting.  Diarrhea from bad hoagies.  Eric Nagel is...  He's not allowed into the halls of justice because a lot of times he liquid shits down his legs.  Superman slips in it.  He gets all mad.  He gets paralyzed.  Hoagie boy.  He just walks into the room slowly with two hoagies in his hand.  And he takes a bite out of each one while a crime is being committed.  Just watches the crumbs.  He helps no one.

And they got a bunch of new weaponry and whatnot in this game  Jimmy, when you were in Toronto, did you go underground?  They have a whole underground city up there  Oh, no, I didn't know that  What?  I was in and out of the city  I was out of the city under the ground  It's crazy  They are  Now you're just talking nuts  They're all in with the underground shit  Because it gets so fucking cold up there 
[01:48:00]  They decided, let's put a lot of shit underground  You could walk for  I want to say miles  But you could walk certainly for a lot of blocks  With a lot of shit underground  It's kind of cool  Damn  Yeah, there it is  There's a whole city under there  There's a whole  It's like going to the mall  Yeah, I haven't done it  The mall underground  Wow, I know, I did not do that  I haven't done it in years  But you could be underground in Toronto for a long time  Well, this is Rockefeller Center  This isn't the Toronto  Oh, show me the Toronto one  Where's Toronto?  Toronto's underground city is amazing  And they have different levels and all sorts of shit going on 
[01:48:30]  Wow  They realize people don't want to be walking around in sidewalks in the winter  Is that it?  I don't know it  I don't know it  Alright, whatever  Like a fucking ant farm  It is  It's crazy  Especially Toronto, it is  It's like an ant farm  You're absolutely right  All sorts of levels and shit  They got banks and bars  Places to eat  All sorts of shit down there  Oh, here you go  Toronto underground market  It's a big old place  Look, it's a whole market on the ground  Wow, look at that 
[01:49:00]  Oh my god  What the fuck's that line for?  They're all just standing there  That looks small  It looks like a party  Yeah, it does look small  That might just be the one store  Cheesy pano shop  GameStop would not be the place to go for black ops  That's right  You want to know why, Ant?  Justin's going to tell you  Why?  Justin  Why?  Good morning, gentlemen  Hi, Justin  Hello  Anthony, I would probably avoid GameStop  Someone like you could probably get the game 
[01:49:30]  But they give their games to the pre-ordered people first  Here comes the pre-ordered people  Or the 24-hour Best Buy  I've gone into GameStop, though  On the first day of a release of a game and gotten it  This one, they've had a massive amount of pre-orders  Well, I don't doubt it  Are there any game advisors out there that can help you?  I need a game advisor to help me purchase this game 
[01:50:00]  Oh, well, you can't just be, you know, the idiot that works at GameStop  Of course  So you have to be a game advisor  Get out of here  I swear  Game advisor  We all had shitty jobs, just except you got a shitty job  Except you're a shitty job, you're right, yes  Eventually you might not have a shitty job  That's the beauty of America  But you can't make your shitty job sound better  You sell used video games  Right  I had shitty jobs, I didn't try to fuck it up my title  Huh?  I have a much shittier job than that  What is your shitty job?  What do you do?  I sell cars  Ew 
[01:50:30]  That's not bad  The Manfredi way?  No, I work at Toyota  Can't you call the Manfredi way?  Honestly, the Manfredi way  We do the right thing every day  The Manfredi way  Come to us and you'll drive away  Get this call, the Manfredi way  Yeah  There's no better way to say it  The Manfredi way  Can't you call the Manfredi way?  We're on Highland Boulevard today  We care about you every day  When you're ready  Go to Manfredi 
[01:51:00]  Shut up  Yay  Kujeria kid looking motherfucker  Yay  When you're ready  Go to Manfredi  Hey, look  I bought you a teddy  Put it on  A teddy  Not the bear kind  Right  The sexy lingerie  Say hi to Josh in Philly  Who's saying Justin is wrong  We get this every single time  Yes  Every single time  A listener calls at something  Another listener will call to refute 
[01:51:30]  What has been said by prior listener  And Justin's still on the line  Josh, what do you got to add?  He's not that wrong  There's three versions of Black Ops 2  There's the regular version  Which is going to be for sale  But there's a hardened  And a care package edition  Which Treyarch is probably sending you  With all the bonus content  Mm-hmm  Boner content  Yeah, the boner content  The one you're going to be getting today  Is just a straight up $60 version  Yeah  So what's wrong with that?  Well, I want a care package 
[01:52:00]  Why?  I want that  Because I want to fucking  I want to be able to use that motherfucker  Why can't you just buy  Hey, I retort  Oh, Justin wants to retort  Well, allow me to retort  Go ahead, Justin  If you go to Target  You can pick up that hardened edition  Because they buy extra copies  I have never seen a hardened edition  Or a care package edition  Which the one Anthony wants  Is the care package edition  The one with the big box  That has the helicopter  And the dirty box  I might have it 
[01:52:30]  No, they won't have it  This is exactly what you hear, by the way  When you put your headphones on  Playing the game  Dribble like this  Why do you really want this?  I don't want the hardened box  I don't want the big plastic box  What do you want?  You want to pay an extra $140  For some shitty plastic toy  That you already have?  I got the fuck  What?  It comes with a fucking drone?  It's a toolbox  I don't need that drone  It's fucking ridiculous  Come on, man  You just need the fucking game  That's all you need  Thank you  Why can't they just sell the game?  Enough of the extras  And all this shit  I gotta try to fuck in  Here's my $60  Give me everything you got 
[01:53:00]  Thank you, Justin  And thank you, Josh  Does anybody buy the stuff  Thinking it's going to be worth money?  They probably do  Yeah, not anymore, though  There was a time  That shit was worth something  But  Corey in Vegas  He is a game advisor  Oh, good  How you doing, boys?  Welcome aboard  Look, I used to work with GameStop  And GameCrazy  What they used to do  Is they used to  Look at the pre-order list  We have $60  They order $200  And then the first day  The first hour  They already got none  And then for the rest of the day 
[01:53:30]  They would just keep selling it  And they used to lie to people all the time  Just like the fucking iPhone 5  So any jackass you call  And say you have to pre-order  They're fucking stupid  I'm waiting online  For Black Ops 2  I want to get the call  The Duty 2  All right, boys  All right, Corey  That's some great inside info  From GameAdvisor  Yes, thank you, Corey  Yes  Boo  Boo

Yeah, it says  You could just on a horrible winter day  Be underground for the whole weekend  The connections are considered tunnels  Architecturally and technically 
[01:54:30]  But their air conditioning  Have lighting as good as any building's  Livable space  Many of the tunnels are large  You have to have shops on both sides of the passage  There's over 20 miles of tunnels  Spread out over more than 4.6 square miles  Connected areas include shopping malls  Apartment buildings  Hotels  Condos  Banks  Offices  Museums  Universities  And 7 metro stations  Wait, you can have an apartment underground?  Well, I imagine you get to it from underground  You probably  You need a fucking window  It's amazing  Who lives like an animal?  Oh, you do travel

I don't know if it's in Toronto  But, I mean, almost the entire city of Montreal  Is, like, underground  Like, there's underground stuff  It's incredible  Oh, yeah, I've been underground there  But people probably  Do they go underground during the summer?

Jesus  Super Sex  Yeah, it's probably all touristy and dumb  Yeah, we can go to Club Super Sex  That's what I call the back office  Yeah, Montreal's alright though  Yeah, it's a great town  Didn't the United States own Montreal for a while  What do you know about that, Travis? 
[02:01:00]  I don't know anything about it  They still talk about it  They still go up there a lot  Yeah, but you know  We gave up on it  You know that, right?  What?  They gave up on it  We actually owned Montreal for a while  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, we said fuck it  Why did we say fuck it?  Do you know?  Not a clue  And how many years did  Was it part of the United States?  Not even in England  It was in the 1700s  And it was annexed back to Canada  Canada had it first  And then we got it for about 70 years  And then they got it back  Annexed  He held it together until the end 
[02:01:30]  He held it together until the end  Annexed  You'd be great at Boulder Dash  That's so close  That's so good  I don't know what Annex means  And then he squeezed his teeth  Yeah, yeah  I've never seen that before  He sounds so believable  But then he couldn't hold it together  Oh  Uh  Right  Annex  The best weekend to go to Montreal  Is during the F1 race  Yeah, that's huge up there  The Formula 1 race  Yeah  Alright, Tui, you got anything else?  No, that's good  I feel like I keep listening to you guys 
[02:02:00]  Thanks a lot  Hey, you sound good, baby  You take care  I'm going to start being smooth with ladies  You already are  Yeah, what do you mean to start?  We learn about Montreal  And when it was owned by the United States of America  Maybe I wasn't listening that well that day  I learned a lot up there  You should go there  Why would we give up on Montreal?  It's a great city  I think we should go  We'll give them fucking Buffalo  You can take Buffalo  We'll take Montreal  I don't want to give them Buffalo  Until after New Year's Eve  Good point, Jimmy  When my performances happen 
[02:02:30]  Good point  Oh  But I want to do something in Canada  Sorry to my friends in Buffalo  But fuck, Montreal's a bit better of a city  Just a little  Holy fuck  I really need to know the answer to that dumb question  A little history  We need a little history here  Why not?  Some Canadian history  Danny's got the answer  Alright  Hello, Danny  The question here is  I heard once that the U.S. owned Montreal  Yes  So the answer says  Not exactly  Early in the American Revolution  The Continental Army captured Montreal in 1775 
[02:03:00]  Then they moved into Quebec City  By the end of  By the spring of 76  The American force in Quebec  Was defeated  And survivors forced back to New York  So  What army?  Wait, we blew it?  The Continental  The territorial  Oh  Do your balls hang low?  Do they wobble to and fro?  Can you tie them in a knot?  Can you tie them in a bow?  Can you throw them over your shoulder like a continental soldier?  Do your balls hang low? 
[02:03:30]  Well, no  That's not what we're talking about  No  The continent  What happened was  There was continental soldiers  And then they were overtaken by United soldiers  And their frequent soldier program started to suck  No kidding  Are they always delayed to battle?  Yeah  Always  They don't accept American Express anymore  Yeah, and there's much uglier older women  Fucking working there now  But United's bragging about their new planes  That we'll eventually have  Oh  That's nice  I wouldn't mind a nice new plane  God, so we could have had Montreal 
[02:04:00]  What happened?  We got lazy?  Yeah  I guess we fucked that one up  We kind of had it in the palm of our hands  That'd be real fucked up though  Just part of the United States  Just darting up into Canada like that  You mean like Alaska?  Yeah, like Alaska  What are you talking about?  That's how  Crazy  Look at the map  It looks weird  It does look weird  We have shit higher than Canada  That is true  Already  Yeah  You know  We should trade Alaska for Montreal  We'd just have a weird bump in our fucking map 
[02:04:30]  That's okay  Let's see what it would look like  We'll give you another territory  Let's make a new map  Alaska's so big you forget how huge it is  Alaska's giant  How big is Alaska?  It's like half of the United States  Yeah, it's really fucking big  And there's only nine people that live there  It's terrible  Why don't we just drill there  Bunch of dumb fucking birds and ice caps  Exactly  Fuck you  Just drill  The precious  Oh, the precious pristine Alaska  Fuck it  Drill  Yeah  Oh, the three testicleed owl lives there  Yeah  Well, tell that faggot to move 
[02:05:00]  We need Earl  We need Earl  Yeah  Why should the owl drive his car?  663,000 square miles  That's actually a figure that's changed over the years  They originally thought it was smaller  By eight miles  And the United States is 3.8 million square miles  So it's a sizable chunk  Sure is  All right, there's your geography for today  We try not to talk about wrestling on this show  But there's some really good wrestling shit going down  Yeah  Remember Jerry Lawler? 
[02:05:30]  Oh, right  Having a real heart attack  This is so fucked up  Kept the show going  Yeah  Well, he's back  And Vince McMahon  Proving once again  How twisted he is  Yep  I guess Sam's running down the hall  To help us here  But in the meantime  Amy Schumer also got a little mention  On Raw last night  Oh, really?  Well, she might have dated a wrestler there  For a while  And Mick Foley brought it up  Mick Foley's back with those guys  Yeah, he's just doing like 
[02:06:00]  Here and there stuff  Helping with Survivor Series  He's not wrestling  He will have to wrestle  I don't know  Vince will make him wrestle  I talked to him last Thursday  And he said he wasn't planning on wrestling  He wasn't planning on wrestling  And he couldn't confirm  He even knows it's just a matter of time  Yeah, he couldn't confirm  Think he's a millionaire?  Mick, yeah  He had a  Oh, because he's cheap, too  Yeah, and he had a couple of really  He had a couple really good years  Yeah  Where he made a lot of money  He's definitely a millionaire  Who do you got? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah  I'm going with  Whoever wins the voting tonight  And their partner  Kane  Amy Schumer says hello  As Dolph Ziggler is walking away  He just said that  Oh, boy  I guess they dated a little bit  Yep  Yeah  That's a good one  Yeah, and  Apparently that was improv'd by Mick  Really?  It's not bad for Amy Schumer  No, not at all  That's a huge audience 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  Yeah  And she was like, you know, if you  I was looking at, just to see what happened  If you look at her Twitter followers  Mm-hmm  Right after that, like for the next hour  You start going over who just followed her  And they're all like people with WWE in their screen name  And stuff like that  Wrestling Jerry  Yeah  Have fun with that, Amy  Yeah  With those knuckleheads  Yeah  All right, what happened with The King?  Well  Oh my God  He came back to commentary last night  Should we just play the video or is this better? 
[02:07:30]  The first thing you should look at is  The video?  No, go to the first one you just had  Yeah, that one  Okay  This is the package that they played to announce that Jerry Lawler's going to come back after commercial break  So this is the first time in, what, two months or so?  Yeah, I think it was  He had a pretty serious heart attack  Nine weeks  And they continue with the show as they're trying to keep him alive  Well, not only was it a serious heart attack, he was dead  He was clinically dead  Oh my God, he did clinically die  Yeah  He flatlined  And they just luckily had paramedics on the scene 
[02:08:00]  Like they said  Big brawny wrestler paramedics?  Or real guys  They said if it had happened in his hotel room, he would have died  How long was he out for?  Like flat along, because they're right there  Yeah, I don't know exactly what the time was  But you know how we all said, like they didn't have footage of it  Like when it first happened, we watched like a fans  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Right  They put this package together  And now that everything's fine  If you look at the package, they've filmed everything  Yeah  So they showed actual footage of him  Yeah, just watch the package 
[02:08:30]  In the middle of a heart attack?  Yes  Fuck, Vince McMahon is sick  Yeah, yeah  Vince is just like  You don't even need the, you can put the audio up if you want  No wonder his son left at WWE  I own your heart  Everything is obviously filmed  He didn't want to be part of this craziness anymore  In case everything's fine and later on it's going to be good for business  You've got to film it  That's right  Wow, Vince  And again, listen to the WWE fans  And Titus with the power and the strength again 
[02:09:00]  Uh-oh  Titus O'Neil continues to hammer away  See the  Listen  Jerry  Jerry talking, buddy  Jerry  Jerry talking  That's him wheezing  Oh my god  They're showing him  Being taken out of the arena  Being wheeled out  It's just footage  Yeah, a whole bunch of paramedics  Guys, clear the area  Please  Now backstage  That's him on the stretcher 
[02:09:30]  Unconscious  They didn't reenact this?  That's the actual footage?  No  Passed out here at ringside  Talk to me, Jerry  Jay, talk to us  Jerry, talk to us  Oh my god  Jerry's receiving  Medical attention as we speak  Watch this  Look at his body  Whoa  They show him getting fucking  Shocked  And they're  They're doing chest compressions  With you  And we hope to have some sort of  Up there  Holy shit  Wow  Flatline shit  This is chilling 
[02:10:00]  Dude, Michael Cole legit thought  Like at first  He was like  Holy shit  He may  He's  Right  He may not come back  Now they show him in the ambulance  Through the  The window  As they're driving away  Oh my god  The ambulance just exploded  What happened  Wow  So obviously he ended up being okay  Dude  That just gave me a chill  They showed everything  Holy fuck  I mean can you imagine the footage 
[02:10:30]  That they have locked up  Of Owen Hart probably  I'm sure  Oh  They have to film  They obviously film absolutely everything  Cause why  When they're clearing people out  Would you throw a camera guy in  To keep filming  Holy fuck  Cause it could be good for business  If everything turns out okay  And that wasn't reenacted  It's pretty obvious  No  Definitely not reenacted  They're shocking  That's something  Fucking Vince knows  Wow  I know it sells  And they'll lock it away  If it's not gonna be good for business  They'll lock it away  And now nobody will ever see it 
[02:11:00]  But  But  But  But the king knows this game  And he's like  Yeah fuck it  I'm alright now  So watch it  You can show that shit  I'd love to know  What tidbits they got  Oh boy  Do they have Owen Hart falling  Oh yeah  Have you ever seen that  No  Nobody has  But  I mean the hard cam  Is there  You know  So then what happened  So then  So this is obviously  Oh by the way  Put that on our Facebook page  I'm sure the wrestling fans  Have seen it already  But  Yeah yeah yeah  It's just compelling  But even if you're not a wrestling fan  That's something to check out  My god  Opie and Anthony on Facebook 
[02:11:30]  So then that was obviously played to  You know  Kind of draw some sympathy  Right  They announced  They go to commercial break  They announced  Jerry the King Lawler is back  He comes out  He does  Like an interview  And he's thanking all the fans  Did he get a nice ovation  He got a huge  Ridiculous ovation  They love him  Yeah  And so he's saying  Do he look good  Yeah  I mean his voice is a little gravelly  But other than that  He's the same  He looks exactly the same  And  He went behind the table  And did the last two hours of Raw  Doing commentary  He's back doing commentary  How long is Raw 
[02:12:00]  It's three hours now  What the fuck  It's eight to eleven  Oh my god  Every Monday  Yeah  How much dead time in there  Oh don't say that  No  Three hours  He already said he doesn't know  They do a good job  The turnbuckle  He's off the turnbuckle  Nothing's worth  I'm gonna run back and forth  And bounce off  Bounce off these strings  And you jump over this  And I'll fall on Ivan Koloff  The turnbuckle  He's not there anymore 
[02:12:30]  You know that  Nothing's worth three hours  Even this radio show  We do it for four  Oh  True  So he's  So he's  So he you know  He comes back  And it's all emotional  And everybody's chanting  Jerry  Jerry  And as he's saying  Thank you to everybody  For supporting him  That that dastardly CM Punk's music  Started playing  What?  Uh oh  Wow  And CM Punk interrupted it  And he kind of like  It kind of got a lot of  Even wrestling internet fans 
[02:13:00]  Like very offended  Because they love Jerry Lawler  Right  And they made an angle out of this  To get Punk some heel heat  And it worked  I mean  Of course it's gonna work  Heel heat they call it?  Yeah  Yeah I mean you could call it that  Yeah you could call it that  Like when people don't like you  I got it  You know people now will pay  To see you get beat up  And so he interrupted Jerry  The King Lawler  Having his moment  And this is what he said to him  With his comeback from his fucking  And so  Heart attack  Or his flatlining  Yeah  And so Lawler got out of the ring 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  And then Punk got in the ring  And this is what Punk said to Lawler  Jerry  I'm glad you left the ring  When you did  Because  If you didn't  I would have beat you to death  Holy shit  Oh my  Again  Oh  There's just sick fucks over there  Because Lawler had wrestled Punk  Like a week or two  Before his heart attack  Again  Oh my god  And so CM Punk took credit 
[02:14:00]  For beating him to death  Fuck  I like the CM Punk  He's fearless  How much is  How much is this  Scripted  Or does he just fucking go with it  I don't think  On his own  Yeah  From writers and stuff  And people I've talked  Punk doesn't really  Do a lot  Like  And he's  What do you mean he doesn't do a lot  Like he's the type of guy  That will take a script  And throw it out  Oh okay  Like  But it works  So Vince lets him do it obviously  Of course  And he decided to go with this angle  Like he was supposed to  Last time I saw him  He was supposed to give 
[02:14:30]  WWE.com a quote  It's their website  And they told me  That they went to his dressing room  And they were like  Oh can we just  Get a quote for the website  And he just looked at him  And goes  No  And he  So he won't even like  Wow  Play with the website  I found him very easy  To get an interview with  Well I was able to interview him  Myself  That day  He kind of loves our show  Yeah  More than the WWE website  I think  So I've heard  So he continued  Yeah  Okay  Shame on you  Jerry Lawler  Shame on you 
[02:15:00]  For trying to steal my spotlight  With this whole heart attack stuff  You know  People in the back  Are talking about  The number of minutes  That you were clinically dead  And I  I look them in the eye  And I say  Who cares  Who cares about the number of minutes  That somebody was clinically dead  I can give you a number  That actually means something  358  And that's the number of days  I have consecutively  Successfully  Defended  My WWE championship 
[02:15:30]  Making it about him  That is funny as fuck man  He's saying that  The number of minutes  You were dead  Doesn't matter  Because I've been champion  For 358 days  You know how important that is  Yeah  The king looks good though  Yeah  He looks in  He looks in better shape  Than all of us  He looks in shape  He lost some weight  What the fuck  He's got a nice tan  Punk is like an old school bad guy  That like would go out of his way  To make sure  That the entire building  Hates him  He doesn't want to be  Do a lot of people hate him?  At that point yes  It's very difficult for Punk 
[02:16:00]  To be hated  Because people like him  So he has to go  And tell Jerry Lawler  He's going to beat him to death again  Do they like him  Better as a bad guy  Or a good guy?  Wrestling fans  Well I mean  There are a lot of kids  Who are wrestling fans  So obviously they like him  As a good guy  Right  But he's definitely  Way cooler  As a bad guy  I think he'd rather  Be a bad guy  Right  He's better  He's better as a bad guy  Could he turn around  And be a good guy again?  Yeah  And it will absolutely happen  When you least expect it  He finished up with this  And honestly King 
[02:16:30]  From the bottom of my heart  I'm glad you're here  I'm glad you're back  And on Sunday  I'm glad you're going to have  A front row seat  To watch me do  Exactly what I say  I'm going to do  Just  Try not to croak  Before the pay-per-view  Okay  Wow man  People were so pissed  Oh shit  That's kind of funny  Because you know  The King is all about it  He's fine with it 
[02:17:00]  Oh he probably gets it completely  Yeah  He probably got a hard on  The worst part about  This whole thing  The whole thing  That people really got pissed off  And you'll see  You got to watch the video  A little bit  Right  Fast forward a tiny bit  Because it's not really audio  Yeah  But Paul Heyman  Who's CM Punk's  Like manager guy  Wait is that the original Paul Heyman?  Yeah  From ECW  He started right there  In the middle of the promo  That Punk was cutting  Yeah  Paul Heyman faked a heart attack  Oh yeah  Look at his  Oh no  He's faking a heart attack  Holding his chest  They're just sick over there 
[02:17:30]  I love this  Paul you alright?  Oh my god  He's loosening his tie  He's coughing  He just falls to the ground  Oh no  Literally  Six minutes before this  Jerry Lawler was thanking  Everybody for the support  And Punk's throwing up the X  Which to the back  Means somebody's injured  That means someone's really hurt?  Yeah  Oh that's a real sign  Yeah  He's giving him chest compressions 
[02:18:00]  In the middle of the ring  Somebody help  Somebody help  Oh look at the king  Doesn't look happy  Oh the king is just standing there  Do you think Jerry Lawler's bothered at all by this?  Probably not  Probably not you think?  I don't think so  He's wrestling  He's saying yeah I'm fine  Oh my god 
[02:18:30]  You know what he's saying?  Lord King  He's crediting CM Punk with saving him from a heart attack  I just saved your life  I just saved your life  One  He's okay  He's okay  He's pointing and laughing at Jerry Lawler  Oh my god  He almost gave me a heart attack  Oh my god 
[02:19:00]  The sick part about it Paul  Heyman doesn't look like he's in good shape  No  So you think  And then  Mick Foley came out to be the voice of reason  Oh  Doesn't cease to amaze me  That somebody who  Demands respect like you  Refuses to give it to somebody  Who commands respect  Like Jerry the King Lawler  Mankind can grow some facial hair man  Oh yeah  He's a king  Jesus  How about you respect Paul Heyman 
[02:19:30]  This man just had a heart attack  And I brought him back to life  And you know what  He didn't need two months off  Like Jerry Lawler  What are you doing out here?  This is getting redundant  Mick  You're wasting my time  You're wasting our time  You and I have no business together  We're no longer captains of opposing Survivor Series teams  That's because Mr. McMahon  Chose to further screw me at Survivor Series  And he took Ryback on your team 
[02:20:00]  Saved a guy from a heart attack  So maybe you should worry less about me  And what I'm doing  And worry more about that gaping hole  Left on your team  You know I'm not going to worry about that gaping hole  Left on my team  Because I'm not picking  The final member of Team Foley  At Survivor Series  The WWE Universe  Is going to be taking  The last member of Team Foley  Is he good on the mic, Mick?  He is  He's great 
[02:20:30]  It's obvious what's happening  He's going to fucking wrestle  He might  Of course he's going to wrestle  Mick, don't wrestle him  Listen  Who's better than CM Punk on the mic?  How does that work?  Current  Right now  CM Punk is really good  He's great  Yeah, I think CM Punk's probably  CM Punk's one of the few guys  Who can get away with not using a script  You know what I mean?  Right  I don't think there are many guys  You think he just bullet points  And go right  I kind of got to get to this  And this and this  Yeah, he knows where he's going  Because that's what they used to do  Right  They used to not have scripts  They used to not even have writers  But yeah  Punk's one of the very few guys 
[02:21:00]  Who's good enough  To be able to carry himself  Who goes back and forth with him well?  Is John Cena good?  John Cena's good, yeah  The Miz is alright  But The Miz falls apart sometimes  You can see it in his eyes  He's not always that confident  I love The Miz  But he's not always that confident  The Miz was on  Which one was he on?  Real World?  Real World  And he's a fan of our show  There's a guy named Daniel Bryan  Who you guys don't know  But he's excellent on the mic  How is Ziggler?  How is Ziggler?  Ziggler's really good on it  Ziggler's great  Ziggler? 
[02:21:30]  He's mentioning people  We don't even know now  Dolph Ziggler's the one  That was fucking Amy Schumer  Oh man  How about you speak respectfully  About our friends  She's our friend  How about you speak respectfully  About our friends  With their feet in the air  Our friend that got fingered  By a taxi driver  Well that's some good wrestling  Right there  I gotta be honest with you  That's so funny  In general I'm not really  Into the wrestling thing  These days  But that's some good shit  That's hilarious man  Absolutely  And Jerry Lawler's like  An old school guy  Who's like  He was around when  Andy Kaufman 
[02:22:00]  He slapped him in the face  In 82 or whatever  On Letterman  Why don't we get him  On our show  He used to do our show  Lawler?  Yeah let's try to get him on  For a quick interview  Now that he's back  People would like that  You got a little gift  In front of you  I did  I don't know how  Roland did it  I don't know if the fucking  Did he go to the store?  No he said  Fenix  If he bought the  Oh man  No no Fenix  If he absolutely bought  The fucking thing  Then I gotta pay him back  He probably had one  For himself  Cause he plays that game  He's probably bummed 
[02:22:30]  That he had to get out  That's right  I do I have  Call of Duty Black Ops 2  I've gotten it  Can I see it?  Thank god  No  I'm gonna throw it  Yes you will  Mine  The mic is easy to work  For wrestling  It's easy  No it's not  Why don't you do a little  When I talk  You gotta give me a storyline  Well that's just it  You just gotta  You gotta cut a promo  And explain  Why at the Survivor Series  Your team will triumph overall  Oh there you go  My team  Is gonna triumph overall 
[02:23:00]  McMahon  Because Mean Gene  Doesn't know  What he's talking about  Now come hell or high water  We're going to strike down  The opposition  And be victorious  McMahon  This is his entry music  The music is playing  That would be great  He just comes walking out to this  With a plunger  I'm doing the dance  Oh my god  Jim Norton's making his way  Hey Roland 
[02:23:30]  How you doing  You alright  Where did this come from  I bought it  So when yours comes in  I'll just take yours  Because the only same one  For each of you guys  Oh man  What about mine  I want mine  I don't want one  I got nephews  I got nephews  I need mine  This time  No  You can have mine  I want that shit  If I didn't get one  Thank you Roland  He's very nice of you  Womp womp womp  Womp womp womp womp  Alright we gotta 
[02:24:00]  Take a break  We got Dr. Robin Zazio  Coming in studio next  Yes I just saw  It was on a few weeks back  A hoarders  From last night  I saw it on demand  Holy fuck  It was the worst one  I've ever seen  Really  The worst one  I've ever seen  Ever  And by leaps and bounds  What was it  This woman had  She lived with her mother  They were both hoarders  They fucking hoarded  They didn't clean anything  The toilet was busted 
[02:24:30]  They shit in a giant  Spackle bucket  What the fuck  And then the mother  Like  And what they would do is  They couldn't take  The spackle bucket  And lift it out  So they took a coffee cup  And would scoop the shit  And piss out of the bucket  And pour it into  Individual jars  And just leave the fucking  Like Gatorade bottles  Laying around  Then her mother dies  A couple of years ago  She still has her mother's  Shit and piss jars  All over the house  And uh  She's still  Shitting and pissing 
[02:25:00]  In this bucket  And dumping it outside  And she takes this  This like  A pan  And the coffee cup  And scoops her  Shit and piss out  And then dumps it out  In the yard  And then makes herself  Stuff to eat  Without washing her hands  Are they  Is she a mentally  Unstable woman?  A fucking  Bat shit  Crazy lunatic  That's her right there  Let me see her  I guarantee you she's ugly  Of course she's a fatty  She goes  I'm on disability  Yeah  There she is  Carrying her shit bucket  Fuck all these people  I agree  No tolerance 
[02:25:30]  Like just shoot her  You're scooping up  Your own shit  And putting it in  Individual jars  Do we really need you  Walking around  Matt  Matt was in that episode too  Matt Paxton  Matt Paxton  He was totally disgusted  He's trying to tell this woman  Do you realize  What smells in here?  And she goes  It's probably  A little mold  And dust  He goes  No  It's feces and urine  That's what makes it  And she goes  I guess I don't even  Smell it anymore  I don't know  I'm a little messy  Was the house  Really messy besides this? 
[02:26:00]  Worst house ever  No  Come on  Yes  The refrigerator  Was just black goop  Why is this show  Going away?  What do you mean  It's going away?  I don't know  Matt said it might  I don't think  It's definite yet  Is it?  I don't know  But it's obvious  It's going away  Sooner than later  It's had it's run  I wonder if they feel  They've exhausted  Maybe  These idiots  Well there's only  So much you can show  I mean it's the same  Episode over and over  Which is not a reflection  On them  It's just  It's just like  Showing you know  A masturbation addiction 
[02:26:30]  Like how many times  But you know what I mean  There's only so many ways  To show it  Over and over  Yeah  It was so fucking  Is there a video clip  Of her  Yeah please  Taking her shit bucket  It's so nasty  Her shit bucket  Oh wait  Tom has something  To add to this  Tom go ahead  I gotta see a clip  Hey what's up boys  How you doing  Hey man  Hey  Hey  Yo when they ask her  Why do you have  All these drops and stuff  She gets all defensive  And is like  Well nobody told me 
[02:27:00]  To throw these away  How am I supposed  To know to throw  This stuff away  She didn't know  To throw it away  Her toilet  Was caked  With black spots  Of just  Like smeared shit  All over  Is there mold in there  Mold everything  Bugs  Yeah  Bugs  What about  What about her  Her final meal  That she wanted to eat  Her final closure meal  Of the fucking lettuce  Or whatever the fuck it was  This is my final one  Just one last one  She wouldn't throw food away  She wouldn't not throw food away  So  And it was rotting 
[02:27:30]  And expired  And moldy bread  And everything  It's just rotting food  And she insisted  She goes  Well if you want me  To throw it away  I gotta have one last high  By just eating some  Today  And they're like  No it's  It's rotting food  She goes  I don't care  And then there was  A loaf of bread  And they go  Do you see this bread  Is moldy  She goes  It's not moldy  Because the mold's right there  Well I pick the mold off  She didn't get sick  They should just let her eat it  No I guess not  Go ahead fatso  Eat it  She doesn't get sick from it  It's amazing  We've done this break  But it's worth doing  Another million times 
[02:28:00]  Go ahead fatty  Eat it  I wouldn't fucking  Cater that shit  It was by far  The most disgusting  Eat your stupid  Moldy bread if you want  I don't give a fuck  That's her  Hatable people  Let's see which clip this is  Pot this up  And we'll listen to this  Fucking disaster area  Coddle these assholes  No thanks  Shana  She's from Washington State  No just the top layer  I can't go all the way down  Look how everyone's just there  For a little more volume  This family has very dysfunctional communication problems 
[02:28:30]  It's all contaminated  It's all that shit and piss on it  It all needs to go in the garbage  We have a hard time understanding one another  But some things can be saved  And that's what an extreme cleaning specialist told me  Are you going to argue with him then?  Yeah I am  I'm going to say nothing  Matt Paxton's laughing  You're going to argue with somebody  That goes  That does level four and five hordes  That are the worst  I am  They're even worse than my level three horde  That's in my bedroom  I hate a bullshit  My, no  My bedroom  It's off the chart 
[02:29:00]  If they had a level 20  I'm sure this would be it  If they had a level 100  I'm sure this would be it  So your thing is that  Whatever the highest level there is  This would be it  Well I got news for you  Some of my clothes can be saved  So what are you going to say to that?  Hey if you want to wear  Sh** clothes  More power to you  Sh** clothes  I wouldn't want to  F***** wear nothing  Or touch nothing in this house  Sean listen  She is engaging in the process  And I know it's frustrating  I don't want to be part of this process  You gotta be 
[02:29:30]  I'm going to make one point  And we'll cut it  This is all the family you got left  These four or five people sitting right here  We gotta save this family  I just want to get this s**t cleaned up  My hope is that I can have a breakthrough  And they can start to understand  The differences in the personalities  And also have more compassion  For Shanna  Fuck Shannan  We'll get the other Robins out here  When she comes in  To talk about  That lady's so hateable man  Fuck her  Burn the house down  Yes 
[02:30:00]  It was all about her  And it was all about  People not understanding her  And then she loves the idea  That there's different levels of hoarding  And she knows about it  And I'm a three  And no  Just a fat self-centered monster  Yes  Fuck her  I understand the people out there  That try to help people  And make them better  Yeah  Psychologist  Psychologist  Which one?  Whatever  Psychiatrist  Psychologist  Both  Both right in the end  But then there's people  It's so obvious  You cannot help them  No  So why f***** try 
[02:30:30]  Why try in the end  That woman's beyond f***** help  Help right  Beyond help  She'll go back to putting  Shit in her stupid jars  And buckets  Shit  They had so many jars  Of shit and piss liquid  That they had these  Giant garbage pails  That were full of the bottles  And they had to get  A sewage truck in  With a big pump hose  Oh god  And they would dump  Glug glug glug glug glug glug  Dump the shit and piss jars  Into the garbage pails  And then pump out 
[02:31:00]  The garbage pails  Into the sewage truck  And it was like  Ginty more beef stew  You almost got me  To dry heat  Dude it's  I was watching  Last night  It started building up  In the back of my throat  So disgusting  Oh my god  So disgusting  You made me yawn  Yeah yeah  Cause it's the same thing  As  I was watching last night  I was getting fucking  Skeeved out  Imagine touching  Your mother's duty  Fuck  Oh  And like I said  I don't even touch her hands  Matt Paxton asked her 
[02:31:30]  Matt Paxton asked her  Did I come out?  Yeah  Sorry  If she washed her hands  Sorry mommy  Before she eats  And she goes  No  Yeah  And then she's making  This soup  Would you eat at her house?  Oh god  I wouldn't eat in her neighborhood  It's terrible  She poured this soup  In a fucking  Cardboard bowl  And put it in the microwave  Cardboard so she doesn't  Have to clean it  Yeah of course  Of course  And there's bugs on everything  Everything looks like  It's just been splattered  With food 
[02:32:00]  Shit  And piss  And then there's like  Cats of course  So there's cat shit everywhere  How do you live like that?  They're showing the  Before and after shots  No that's someone else  That's all nice  I think they just gave up on Shannon  But you know  They all go back to hoarding  Of course they do  I want to ask Robin about that  What percentage of these people  Go back to hoarding?  And why does she deal  With these people?  Why don't you stop it Robin?  I would say  Well over  Well over 50% of these people  Go back to hoarding  There's gotta be  And I think 50% is safe  I would say  I would say  I'm gonna go 75% of these people 
[02:32:30]  Go back to hoarding easily  Three out of four  How about she retires  From this nonsense  And counsels people  And counsels people  On their sex addictions  Oh  Oh  Have private counseling sessions  On the phone late at night  Oh really Jimmy?  Talking it over  Do you think you would like  To do that?  I would like some help  You gotta think  That would not be a good idea  Wow  Discussing a sex addiction  On the phone  I need some help  With your therapist  Late at night  That's gotta be a twisted job  Yeah yeah  That's probably not gonna work 
[02:33:00]  Well we're gonna have  Robin Zazio  In studio next  She has what?  A new book?  Yes  Zazio  What's the new book called?  I'm not sure  It's in the other room  I hate these messy motherfuckers  It's called  This is like my other book  With a different title  Oh now  I like her  I hold  I hold right there  Huh?  Oh now  Now  I'm sure it's a terrific book  And we'll talk to Robin  About it next  Robin's great  It was in the 1700s  And it was annexed  Back to Canada  Canada had it first  And then we got it  For about 70 years  And then they got it back

[02:35:00]  Puddin' Head Records  And The Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Let's say hi to Robin Zazio  Let's bring in Robin Zazio  Dr. Robin Zazio  She's got a new book  The Hoarder in You  Yes  Robin  Welcome back to the show  How to live a happier  Healthier  Uncluttered life 
[02:35:30]  Damn Robin  Looking good  Look at your jeans  Damn  Damn  I've been a little busy lately  Yeah  Very lovely  A little stress  A little activity going on  Really?  Yeah  Nothing bad is it?  Yeah  Since I last saw you guys  Moved my office  And sold my house  Moved into another house  Alright stressful stuff right there  Yeah  Yeah  So  You know  And like New York  Like what was up with the traffic this morning?  We kind of had a super storm  You might have heard about it  Storm? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah  Yeah it is a little chilly out  Like you know  I mean  You know  Us Californians  You know  When it's about 70  It's like it's not right  She doesn't know what's going on  You don't know  What happened to this area?  Yeah there was a giant hurricane here  And it bashed a bunch of things  That part  We don't got our shit back together  Screwed up the infrastructure  But at least we're not collecting shit in jars  Well that's true  Here we go  It didn't get that bad  You know I was thinking  How do I prepare for this?  And I'm like  You can't  There's no preparing for this show  No  You're really not  But before we even get to that  You mentioned you're moved 
[02:36:30]  Yeah  Did you get rid of some stuff during the move  That might have  Oh my god  You might have been able to get rid of  Oh I can't even tell you  So when I moved my office  I had to condense three buildings down to one  I thought I was going to have a panic attack  Like I literally thought  What was your anxiety level?  What level problem did you have?  Seriously  So my office was in like a home-like environment  And so there's lots of cupboards and lots of storage  And where I moved to there wasn't 
[02:37:00]  So I started putting all this stuff out on the lawn  And I'm panicking  I don't know what to keep  I don't know what to get rid of  I don't want to make the decision  Right?  So I walk outside  And people are walking by  And they're taking the stuff  I'm like  What are you doing?  They're like  I thought it was for free  And I'm like  Oh man  You know what?  They're like throwing it away  Just take it  And it made it easy for me  You know what?  Nice  I'm so glad I'm not a hoarder  Because I don't want to make those decisions  Yeah  Yeah  I really don't  Very difficult for them to make those decisions  It is  It is  I've watched  Seen how horrible it is 
[02:37:30]  You should have made two piles  Like one of  Keep  Keep and one of  Possibly get rid of  But then  No no no  We never do a possibly get rid of  Because you never get rid of it  No you gotta get rid of it  And then they always wind up  Going back to the get rid of pile  When no one's looking  And putting it into the keep pile  Yeah  Or you know  Like you see the two feet  Hanging down in the dumpster  You know  They go dumpster diving  And they're in the back of the truck  Yelling  Because someone threw away  A busted three-legged chair  Yeah  Well you know  You can fix it  Oh of course you can  Whenever they say  I can fix this 
[02:38:00]  Or  This is perfectly good  All I need to do is  You look around  At all the junk  And realize  They're never ever  Going to do anything  Why do they keep this crap  Oprah is a good point  What percentage of them  Go back  To hoarding  You know  I don't  You know  What's the number  No no I really don't  I really don't  I mean we don't even know  How many hoarders are out there  I mean you know  They're lying in secret  You know  But I mean the people  You guys have helped over the years  How many  What percentage of those people 
[02:38:30]  You think  You know I honestly  Don't even know  I can't  I mean my life is crazy  You don't do follow ups  You're like  I can't  You're on your own  I can't follow everybody  You know what I mean  I've done probably about  Over 50 shoots now  I have five seasons  We're into season six now  Just finished my last shoot  For this season  Oh  Was  Can't tell you where  Cause you know  It's a big secret  Hasn't been aired  I think right after  You hear  That's a wrap  You just hear Robin's tires  Squealing away from the house  And never to look back again  And then hold the cast party 
[02:39:00]  In a dumpster  Have you guys been watching  The new season  Oh please  Yes  I can't watch this stuff  Really  I love the show  But it's just infuriating  Love it  It's too angering  Cause I got a me me me  In my family  I know  I know  I don't want to deal  With the me me me shit  I was going to ask you about that  I don't need to watch it on TV too  Love the show  Love you  Love Matt Paxton  And love the black chick  With the Vulcan eyebrows  I see enough clips  Don't get me wrong  I mean  Ant just explained this episode  That's Shanna 
[02:39:30]  It's driving us nuts  Episode  Was  I've watched every episode  Of Hoarders  Since it came on the air  The worst one yet  Yeah  The worst one yet  Where they had to empty out  The jars of feces and urine  Into garbage pails  So the cesspool truck  Can put a hose in  And suck it out  That was by far  The worst case  I've ever watched  You think they got any  On their hands  Under their fingernails  Oh they were wearing  All kinds of stuff  Yeah that was a biohazard crew  I mean we couldn't  We couldn't even come close to it 
[02:40:00]  No  But you know  One thing that people ask is  This has got to be made up  Like you can't  I mean it's got to be  It's like no  No no no  I'm of the mind  That when I get there  I don't walk in the house first  So when you see me  Knock on that door  That's the real deal  I'm walking in  For the first time  And when I drove up  I'm sitting in my car  Going  What's that smell  Oh because the whole  The whole street stinks  It was  You were down the block  And you could smell it  It was so bad  How bad in the house  It was bad 
[02:40:30]  I mean like  How do you  You know sometimes I walk in  And I can't even come up  With the words  Because I've come up  With so many words  What are you spraying over there  It's like baby powder stuff  Yeah it's good  Oh that is nice  We discovered something called  Baby powder mist  Yeah it smells like a strip  Smell that  Uncle Paul  Gives me a boner  Oh Uncle Paul  Stop that  Now  Mind yourself  That's sexy  Does it make you dry heave  Robin  When you smell this  Um no  No  It's just 
[02:41:00]  It's not guttural  It doesn't really  Just go to a level  Where you  It's like I can't even  I can't even  Describe it  Because it's not  Something that  Yeah we can't relate to  It's like oh  Is that baby powder  Like you get it  And then when you walk in  And you have someone  Who's living in filth and waste  And like you know  And and again  Shanna was the real deal  Like you know  When she walked up  And she said  All right  And she was like  She was like an addict  When she walked up  Remember that scene  And she said  I'm going to have  My last hurrah 
[02:41:30]  My last drug  I am going to  And this was the key  I am going to eat  You know  Some contaminated food  And she didn't say  Like I'm going to eat  Some of that expired food  Like she literally said  I'm going to eat  Contaminated food  It's like  Contaminated food  Where does that  How do you wrap yourself  Around that  What was she trying to  Prove or do  By by eating  Contaminated food  That she's in control  Of her environment  Did you let her  See I know this  I would have let her  Listen  What did she eat  Maybe something  That didn't even  Make the show  I mean yeah  There's five days 
[02:42:00]  Of stuff that you guys  Don't even see  Moldy bread  And then just even  The cans of food  That she had  She wouldn't wash  Her hands  Before handling it  After handling her  Feces and urine buckets  And then the cans  Themselves are contaminated  With feces and urine  And you know how  You have an exposure  To the food  And the outside  Of the can  The lid of the can  It's just contaminated  Yeah  It's like  All that shit  Should be thrown away  And she just  Wouldn't have  Would you let her  Make you a peanut  Butter and jelly 
[02:42:30]  Sandwich  With white bread  And fingerprints  And a little mold  Just a little bit  Terrible  What happens to you  When you eat mold  I thought that  Would make you  Pretty sick  Yeah  Is there a way  To break the mold  Well the reality  Is that you know  We all you know  Need some kind of  Bacteria so we  We can become  Immune to it  And I think you know  I mean remember  She didn't like  Buy that house  Like that  It built up over time  And so her system  Adjusts  I mean  Amazing  Amazingly  Yeah  But yeah 
[02:43:00]  I mean you know  And my book  You know that's  What I mean  My book  The horror in you  We're all so close  To that level  I mean you know  You know Matt  Talks about you know  Five decisions away  And you know  And granted  I mean I think  We can all say  Like no  We would never  Get to that point  But you know  All of us have  A piece of a hoarder  In us  Where we can't  Let go  Absolutely  I've got an office  In my house  Full of electronic stuff  Old computer stuff 
[02:43:30]  It's lining the walls  Of my office  It's on my desk  Outdated  Outdated  Some of it  I'll never use  Other stuff  Yeah I bought it  And then found something  That works a little better  And then that's  But why would I even have it  Why do I even bother  Keeping it  I opened to the wrong page  I have a problem  With your book  And Jimmy's gonna have  A problem with your book  What page  And I know it's a terrific book  So just go with it  Thank you  The ten most helpful things  To say to a clutter  I would never say  One of these things  Well Opie 
[02:44:00]  You're not really the norm  You're not  Yeah yeah  I mean you're  You're too close to home  On this one  You're not the control  For this test  Well let me see  If Jimmy's with me  The first one  You say to one of these people  I know this is hard for you  That's not happening  Let me know  How I can help  That's not happening  You don't have to fix  This problem overnight  Let's find ways  Let's find ways to simplify  The process  Don't look at the big picture  Take baby steps  Yuck  When you get overwhelmed  Take a break  And remember your goal  Is to live a healthier life 
[02:44:30]  We are a team  What do you think Jimmy  So far  This is too mushy  For you guys  No no  It's a little different  I understand this  Would help others  But I can't even  I can't even fathom  You're a professional  So this obviously  Is the right way  To go about it  But the normal  Just layman  Looks at that  And says  No here's what you say  What's wrong with you  That's exactly  Clean up your house  You pig  That's one and two  Number one  Is what's wrong with you  Two is clean up your house  You pig  Three kill yourself 
[02:45:00]  Four you stink  Five I hate this place  You have five seconds  Before I burn it down  Six how did you get so fat  Put the torch on fire  Oh my god  Come on  Come on  You're right  You know what I like  You know what I like  You know what I like  I guess shit is fattening  Oh Jesus  You know what I like  When Robin's on the show too  Is you talk about  When you walk up to the door  And it's the first time  You're getting that reaction  But you're there  Like a welcome wagon person  It's like  Hi  Hi I'm Robin Zazio 
[02:45:30]  Suzy Sunshine  And then hi  It's not like  I'd be like  Ah  Ew  Yeah  I would love to know  What happens  After they stop filming  A few shooters for everybody  A few drinks  A couple  You gotta put a few belts back  You find that local  Fucking gin mill  And discuss  Like you have  Post-traumatic stress disorder  That would be the show  I want to see  After borders  When the cameras are off  The stuff you're saying  At the end of the day  We gotta remember  It is mental illness  And you know  It's so hard to think that 
[02:46:00]  I know  I know  Because it's  It comes off  As so selfish  When you see  When you see  One of these people  Say  And they're crying  Because the people  Want to take away  Their family  And their kids  And lose the house  And they're crying  Going  I love my children  I'd do anything for them  Don't  Don't throw away  The cracked hummel  It's like  How much can you  Love your kids  If you're choosing  Literally  Garbage  And their selfishness  Is what bothers me so much  I understand they're sick 
[02:46:30]  But the fact that  They're so  Self-centered  And that  Goes even beyond  Mental illness  That's just fucking selfish  And that to me  Is the part about  Mental ill people  That drives me crazy  Like you know  People that are  Running around in a circle  Throwing cherry bombs  In the air  Like I really do feel  Empathetic for them  Because they're nuts  I got a real question  So how do you  How do you embrace  Someone in your family  That has mental illness  Like let me finish  Like if someone in your family  Has god forbid cancer 
[02:47:00]  Or diabetes  Or anything else  That we all deal with  A lazy eye  A lazy eye  You can embrace that person  But why is it so hard  If they have such  You know  Such a deep mental illness  Why can't we just  Embrace those  Those people the same way  We do with the other  Examples I gave  Thank you  I think  I'll wait for your answer  I'll hang up now  Thanks  Are you leaving  You know  I think it's because  The behaviors that go  Along with it  Don't make any sense  And when you look  At compulsive hoarding  It doesn't make any sense 
[02:47:30]  I'm the first to acknowledge  That it doesn't make any sense  You're talking about  Your child  Your stuff  You know  I mean really  It doesn't make any sense  But you know  When we talk about  Mental illness as a whole  You know  Someone who's depressed  And they overdose  Like how are you thinking  About the people that love you  Like that's really  Selfish  Like you're so wrapped up  And yourself  But that's the illness  Mental illness is all  About selfishness  And where's there  Where's there  Where's there awareness  And responsibility  In this whole thing  I mean you're trying 
[02:48:00]  To tell me  I'm with you  These  You know  I got one in my family  People know  And it's like  It's like  When do they become aware  Like what they're fucking  Doing with their mental illness  Does that ever happen  I think it depends  I mean how many times  And why do we give them  A pass for that  How many times  Have you seen  Hoarders  When we go up  And the person  Is ungrateful  They're nasty to us  Yeah yeah  You know  I mean I've been there  A couple times  And I'm standing there  Going  I just packed up my life  Flew across the country  To help you  And you're being snotty 
[02:48:30]  Oh yeah  How does that happen  How do you not say  Because that's again  Crazy  But that's somebody  Making a decision  To be shitty  I don't know how  You don't just go  Good  Live in it  And like  Even in the family  Cut them off  Never acknowledge them again  Well Dr. Robin  Will be professional  Like that  Yeah I know  But it's fun to watch Matt  Because he will  He will lay into  These people sometimes  That's why the show  Is so good  Yeah  I have found  When I don't coddle  As much  That things do change 
[02:49:00]  Well you know  And again  We're talking  They realize  They gotta help themselves  A little bit  They do  And at least try  And you know  It's been definitely  More than once  When I've been out there  And said you know what  I'm ready to pull the plug  On this whole thing  Yeah  Because you know  What you don't know  Is that Dr. Trump's everything  So when we go in  We actually have say  Over the process  Right  And you know  Even though it's a team effort  You know what  I'm ready to walk off  This shoot  If you're not 
[02:49:30]  You know  I mean no  You can't curse at me  Like that's not okay  Like I'm not cursing at you  Why do you think  It's okay for you  To treat me this way  But you guys just don't  See those parts  That's true  You know we're talking  Five days  How many hours  Down to 22 minutes  But you've never  Walked off now  Have you  I've walked away  Yeah yeah yeah  I've walked away  Briefly and came back  Like ready to  I mean  We have an episode  Coming up  That is going  To blow your mind  Of course I can't  Talk about it  Even worse than the one  And just described  It is going 
[02:50:00]  To blow your mind  Because it's  It's  It's so indescribable  What they were hoarding  And  Oh man  And the thinking process  And  I'm gonna guess  What were they  Well let's guess  Well they've done everything  So what could  Well if anybody knows me  I'm very passionate  About one thing  Other than shoes  If I didn't like you  Other than shoes  Whoa look at those shoes  Other than shoes right  Let me see  Whoa  You know what they call  Those shoes right  We all know  You have nice heels  We all know what they call 
[02:50:30]  Nice toenails painted  I just got them done  Very nice toenails  She's trying to impress someone  She looks very sexy  Where are you going  After our interview  You're trying to impress  Somebody  Well you really want to know  I'm going to NPR  So you know  Oh god  That's your thing  Maybe she likes to  Show her feet off  She's a foot goddess  No no no  Are you a foot goddess  Are you a foot dom  Are you a dominatrix  No no no  Worship my tootsies  We're backsliding  No  No we're not backsliding  This is exactly  What people want to know  Animals yes  I was going to say  Like the little kittens  I know somebody was hoarding 
[02:51:00]  I'm getting a zebra  Just so you know  What  A zebra  Really  You found a zebra  I just bought a ranch  And I am going to get a zebra  Wow  Yeah  I'm going to hoard stripes  That's pretty cool  Wait so  A zebra  This hoarding episode  Has something to do with animals  Yeah  It does  But you guys have done the cats  You've done the rats  Were they herding  Were they  You've done the dogs  I  You know  Hoarding moths  Moths  Is it an animal that people  Spotted owls  It's not the animal  It's the way it all plays out  It's  Like 
[02:51:30]  I had to walk off  And I'm like behind a tree  Oh okay  Oh man  Because it was so  Hoarding puppies  In little  It's cats  Hoarding cats  In little  Hoarding veal  They were hoarding  Woolly mammoths  You've done all that  Where they're in cages  Because they can't keep  Up with it and stuff  So  Is it  Bees  It's cats  Far beyond what you could  Even imagine  Was your uncle  Slaughtering lambs  Yeah  And you had to  And you had to hide behind a tree  And cry  It was cold  It was very cold 
[02:52:00]  And you picked up a lamb  And what became of your lamb  Robin  Well it's an old movie  You woke up  There was the slaughtering  Of the spring lambs  And they were screaming  They were screaming  Come on  Doc Lecter  Doc Lecter  You gotta give us more  I can't  I can't  It's gotta be  The network will kill me  It's gotta be a pet  Obviously  Yeah  A lot of animals  You wouldn't give a fuck  I'm gonna guess  They were hoarding  Rhinoceroses  In their bathroom  They had three 
[02:52:30]  They had three  Three rhinocerons  Let me tell you  You know it's not what  They were hoarding  It's how it all plays out  Fruit flies  It's pretty  On leashes  Jim  Jim  How it plays out  Ant was hoarding  A bunch of fruit flies  At his bar  I was  Man  God  After my Halloween party  The fruit flies  Just swarmed  Down at my bar  And then like  One day they're just gone  Yeah  They leave  They just go away  Yeah  They just disappear  Your temperature  Dips one degree  And you leave the door open  And they all die  What a fragile little life form 
[02:53:00]  Those stupid things are  Alright so  Were you angry at this person  The hoarder  That you're talking about  Were you angry  Yeah  Absolutely  Like  Yeah  I mean and it's the difference  Between being so angry  I mean I'm human  Like you know  I mean I still  Have to be  Cordial  And professional  But I'm still human  At the same time  It only takes so much  Yeah  Yeah  And when you see  Some of this stuff  You know when you guys go  Like how  How can they be doing this  Like how can you  Not  Get emotional about it 
[02:53:30]  Or  There was  There was no thought  About how bad  What this person was doing  Was  Like did this person  Have any inkling  That they were doing  Something wrong  Because they never seemed to  Yeah but in the process  They thought they were  Doing something right  Oh that's always good too  So that's what  You're like  That's when you just go  Well I've seen things  In the past  Where people are actually  Arguing that they are  Caring  Yeah  For certain animals  That are in their house  Just because they're  Feeding them  Doing the right thing  Yeah  And they're locking them  In cages  They've got sores 
[02:54:00]  They're blind  Some of them are dead  No care  But they would tell you  They love them so much  And they're doing so well  For them  It's just  It's beyond me  I cannot fathom  People that crazy  Yeah  I don't want to deal with them  I hoard eels  How do you do that  I have a big tank  With eels  And dragonflies  Are they all together  Yes they are  One room  The eel dragonfly room  What's the line  Between  Like 
[02:54:30]  You got some stuff  Around the house  You know you should  Get rid of it  But you don't  And the gateway  To hoarding  What's the line there  What makes the difference  You know as always  It's  I think two things  One is  How much is your stuff  Taking up  Your personal space  Is it  Bleeding into  Other people's space  And then  Piece number two  Is how much  Emotional clutter  Is it creating in your mind  So we talk about  Your electronics  Like why can you  Don't talk about  My electronics  Yeah  No no I love  Talking about  Or the cords 
[02:55:00]  Like you see  The cords too  Like what are you  Going to need  How many fucking  Ethernet cords  Do I need  It's not 1992  That's true  And think about it  Like if you look  At those electronics  And if you needed  A new stereo  You're going to  Go out and buy one  Right  You make enough money  Come on  Exactly  Really  Thank you  So what are you  I'll buy two  And throw one away  I don't even care  Take this peasants  You should go to  The compound  And take care of  Anthony and his cords  You know what  I am going to go through  The electronics 
[02:55:30]  In my office  You say this every time  She's here  And throw away  A lot of crap  I am  Why the hell  Would I  Why would I  Hang on to it  I mean you know  I think we should  Get a camera  We should go into  Your office  And like we need  To air it  Well you know  Apparently our app  Is hoarding the same  Sound clip going over  And over again  Of course  Because it's not working  Ant's Soundgarden ad  Has been looping  During Dr. Zazio's  We have a problem  With our app  Great  Yeah  And I think it's  A traffic problem  But I don't know  No I think it's  A purposeful thing  A purposeful thing  They're hoarding  A piece of shit  In company services 
[02:56:00]  So I apologize  But people aren't  Our audience is hearing  But people are  On the app  No it's on the app  On a phone and computer  It only happens  To our best guess  So  Sing  Yeah  Sing  The hoarder and you  By Robin Zazio  I'm going to throw  I'm going to throw  Some of that stuff  No you're not  I'm really going to  You throw some of the  Quartz out  Yeah  No  Yeah because I got  Stuff that I know  You're absolutely right  I will never use again  And it's just  Taking up room  Make a video  I was just going to say  So when you walk  In that room  And you see that  Like do you think  Oh my gosh  Like do you go over 
[02:56:30]  And stroke it  And go I love my  Electronics  Or do you go  That's not what he  Says that to  No  No  But seriously  Like when you look  At it  Does it make you happy  Uh no  I kind of go like  God I got to get  Rid of this shit  Right  It's taking up my office  And you know what  Last time I was here  You said the same thing  I know  Those electronics have  Been there  They're still there  I know you guys  Seriously  I want to be better  I want to be better  Well you know 
[02:57:00]  And the audience  Wants you to be  We've got one shoot  Left  And you know  I'm thinking about  Calling the production  Company  And having a little  Chat with them  I think you're a hoarder  Oh  I'm a shoe hoarder  I am  Are you  I have  When I wrote the book  If you guys read the book  By the way  Come on  It's terrific  I read most of it  Okay good  I'm good with that  It's amazing  Thank you  Yes  Yeah you know  When I wrote the book  I had 175 pairs of shoes  Wow  Well over 200  Wow  Imelda  That's crazy

[02:58:00]  On two of them  I touched the second  And the big toe  I can honestly say  I've never been in an interview  And anybody's touched my toe  So this is a first  First  We can have plenty of few first  If you want  That's right  It all depends on you Robin  Yes please  I'm willing to get first  First time I was here  We took a picture  And it's over my desk  Oh really  I probably was fatter then  Aw  No you look good  You look good  Thank you  Well Jimmy's working out now  But yeah  I've never touched the toes  Of one of my guests either  Of a therapist  It's the first all the way around  That's dirty 
[02:58:30]  I'm not necessarily a foot guy  But you have nice feet  Well thank you  I appreciate that  I like feet when they  I have a tennis ball  I'm sitting on  Because my hamstrings  Jimmy can't she touch you too  I was wondering  Like where that came from  It just kind of  Yeah it kind of fell out of a mile  It just sort of fell out  If it was a ping pong ball  You'd know exactly where it came from  I've done that trick  I was going to leave it alone  But you know  Since it was clean  Jimmy what about  Show her your arm  I have almost wispy arm hair  You can't even tell  There's arm hair there  Yeah brush it  With your finger 
[02:59:00]  I'm the same way  Yeah brush it though  I'm a little darker  But I'm a guy though  I should have hair  Feel my arms  I don't know  You're scared  She jumped  She jumped very very  One of my favorite  Dumbest  That was a good one  Yeah that is  One of the dumbest  Funny things  And Jimmy has amazing calves  I've been told  I'm very calf heavy  Bowling pin calves  Yeah just good calves  What a guy  Yeah comes from  Standing on my tippy toes  Peaking windows  I think this book's 
[02:59:30]  Going to be a best seller for you  Yeah it's a good one  I don't know  You know I mean it's  I think it's pretty user friendly  And it speaks to the average person  You know I think  I mean  No I don't know  Okay so you know  You've read most of it  Or all of it  Close to  Like when you were reading it  Could you relate  You hoard  Too much  You hoard your nose  You know that right  Huh  Oh really  You hoard your nose  Oh sorry  Oh no  That's your thing  We all have our crutches  That's right  I don't have a fucking crutch  Oh I'm howling over 
[03:00:00]  We all have  Do you have a collection  Or a stockpile  That's a good question  That's a very good question  Because there is a difference  I collect things  And you know  But I find myself  With a hoarder mentality  With getting pictures  And all this stuff  And because they're digital  It's not going to take up  A lot of  But getting them signed  It becomes bigger  Than the actual event  And there are  The problem is  Because there are times  Where it makes sense  And it's like  Yeah anybody would do that  But then it goes  Into the ridiculous  That's the way it is  With hoarding  Yeah there's things  You want to save  And there's things  That we all have  That are a little 
[03:00:30]  Unreasonable and stupid  But then it just goes  Into that weird area  How do you know  When it's time  To throw something out  Like you got  A lot of clothes  That's an easy one  That everyone has  I think maggots  They say  You start seeing maggots  On them  It's probably time to  But they say  If you look at something  You haven't worn it  What in a year  Just throw it away  Two days  Did you wear it  In the last season  Even last season  Yeah yeah yeah  So you know  It's getting cold  And you're pulling stuff out  Did you wear it last season  If you didn't  You probably need  To get rid of it  And I mean  Not maggots per se  But there's holes 
[03:01:00]  And moths flying out  When you like  Open up the clothing  Get rid of it  Get rid of it  You're not going to wear it  Get rid of it  Is there a way  To tell like  Earlier on  Before someone  Even starts hoarding  That they might be  Susceptible to it  It always seems like  These people have had  Some type of trauma  In their lives  It's usually the death  Of a parent  Or a child  Something like that  But is there a way  To tell  Is there some kind  Of a marker  In these people  No  Early warning system 
[03:01:30]  Yeah  I mean  You know  There's lots of people  Who didn't grow up  In hoarded homes  That you know  Let's say their parents  Pass away  They don't know  What to do with the stuff  So they bring  All of the stuff  In their house  Into their home  With great ideas  Like how many times  Have you seen the show  Where they're like  Oh yeah  Well I have a plan  To do this  I'm going to put this  On eBay  And I'm going to sell this  I'm going to have a garage sale  But it never happens  Never  And you know  It was interesting  Because I was  In a different interview  Yesterday  And I was talking  A more professional one  Yes  It was a little different  Yeah yeah yeah  And you know  On the other side  Of the block 
[03:02:00]  Uh huh  I got you  And so you know  I was thinking about  My folks house  You know they've got  5,000 square feet  And my mom has  Like a closet  Like the size of  The studio  Oh rich  And I walk in  No no no  Just you know  So I walk in  And I'm  I see  Moo Moo's  And I'm like  Mom what are you doing  With these Moo Moo's  And she's like  Well you know  What if somebody  Has a pool party  I'm like you don't  Wear a Moo Moo  To a pool party  Well at least  You didn't have  Dashikis

[03:10:00]  I got my shoes  I got you know  I mean  Jimmy's got his  Digital stuff  You know  Memorabilia  My toots  My uh  You can start hoarding toes  I'll start hoarding toes  Like Jerome Brutus  I believe  Was a serial killer  Who would cut women's feet off  Or save their shoes  Really  We have a very  It's a really crack  Prep sheet today though  According to this  Are you a licensed  Clinical psychologist  And licensed clinical  Social worker  That's line one  Of the prep sheet  Why would  Why would that be included  Are you really  Now let me ask you 
[03:10:30]  I'm really a doctor  Like I just don't  Play it on TV  Wow  Are you most known  For your appearances  On hoarders on A&E  That's another line  Of the prep sheet  And then the other one  Even more important  Did you recently film  The last episode  Of a season of hoarders  Who wrote this  Who wrote that  Prep sheet  It stinks  Can I guess the animal  Uh  I won't tell you  You can guess  I'm good at reading people  You sure you want  To play this game  Yeah  Alright I'm going to  Go with  I'm waiting for her  To  Her face to be 
[03:11:00]  Back to normal  Because now she's  Trying to  I'm going to go with  Look at me  Horses  No  Did it  But  We did have  There was a  Horse hoarder  In Montana  Seattle  Oh  Different  Yeah  In Montana  It was  Not good  Yeah  Really  We didn't  End up doing it  Because we couldn't  Find any place  To take the horses  Aww  So yeah  How many do they have  I don't know 
[03:11:30]  It was so tragic  Of course  I mean you can see  Pictures of the horses  Dying  Oh my god  Yeah it was just  Like I  That for me  Is so tough  I mean you remember  Chicken Hoarder  Oh yeah  I mean  Yeah  That understandably  Enraged a lot of people  Yeah  Because of the abuse  And it's because of  How selfish her attitude was  Yeah  Yeah  And yeah  I mean that was  That was really  I mean that was another time  That I had to like  Duck behind the trailer  And just like  Saw because it was so  Painful to see  How these animals 
[03:12:00]  Were suffering  We had a good outcome  On that one though  I don't know if you know  What happened but  She fell into a ditch  No  I don't know  Maybe she did  But what I do know  Is that yeah  She was you know  Court ordered  To not have any animals  Oh yeah  Sometimes I can't stand  When they abuse these animals  And then they give them  A court order  Where they can only have  Five cats  It's like  Don't let them have any  Yeah right  I mean  How about zero  That they cannot  Responsibly own a pet 
[03:12:30]  When you break down  During the filming  Of these episodes  Who comforts you  Jesus Christ  Who comforts you  Oh no  I'm like ducking  Because I got cameras  Following me  Because it's like  Good footage  It's like  No no no  Matt Paxton follows you  And just starts pointing  And laughing  Yeah  No no  Robert's crying  No no  No Matt's  Matt's got a  We love Matt  Yeah  We love Rob  Matt's a good guy  He's fun  Oh yeah  He's a fun guy  Another part of your book  That I liked  When I was reading it  Don't fall for freebies 
[03:13:00]  Yeah  What is that about  We all love freebies  Well it means  That they're going to  Ask you for money  On the way out the door  It sounds like it's free  But they're going to  Want something  You see  I've fallen for that  Oh Jimmy  Actually I can't believe  How many people  Fall for freebies  What is the freebies  Well there's always  Something involved  You never get anything  For free  Well so  Question for you  Like you know  Where I live in Sacramento  You know  You'll be driving along  And you'll see  Like somebody just dumped  A couch on the side  Of the road  Nice  Free sign  Or whatever  You don't see that  In New York City  Do you  No  Not really  We'll just steal here 
[03:13:30]  Upstate New York  When I was going to college  We used to go around  The neighborhoods  Finding our couches  And stuff  For the semester  Yeah  Bed bugs must be  In some of those  I'm sure  But every once in a while  You would get a real nice one  Hey true story  I was in Chicago  Uh oh  2 a.m  Tired  Exhausted  Drunk  Drunk  Horny  No no no no  Broken heel  I just wanted to go to sleep  Yeah  Yeah  And I  Oh no  Pull open the sheet  And there's this bug  Oh my gosh

[03:25:30]  From being an intern  Right  And now we're reaping  Those rewards  You know I'm looking  For a new job  Yeah  Why don't you come on board  You could write some  Hoarding's going away  The hoarding show's  Going away unfortunately  No no no  We're good  We're good to go  Oh according to the prep sheet  You filmed your last episode  Of Hoarders  Well for the season  My last episode  For the season  Oh  But you know  We don't have official word  But it's looking good  Oh good  I'm sure it'll come back  I hope so  I'm sure it'll come back  Oh wow  Sounds ready to slip out

[03:26:30]  And he got a haircut  And his mom saved it  In a Tupperware  That's weird  How much hair did you have  At that time  It was long again  It wasn't quite this long  It was long  How psychotic is that  His mother saved  His baby boy hair  That's crazy  No but he was 18  It wasn't his first haircut  Because some moms  Do do some weird shit  That's crazy  Alright alright  So here we go  You ready  What do you guys save  Not electronics  There's got to be something  That's a little bizarre  A little edgy  A little off the beaten track  That you save 
[03:27:00]  And I'm being serious  There's got to be something  I've gone the other way  My wife gets really frustrated  I throw everything away  Probably too much shit  What's that about  That I don't know  What are you afraid of  What can I throw away  Are you afraid you might go  The other way  Afraid of  I  No most of my life  I've just been like  I never settled  Settled into one home  Because of my job  So everything had to fit  In a car  So I guess I still  Live like that  So it's just  Yeah  Wow  But I don't like clutter 
[03:27:30]  That's not bad  No no no  There's nothing wrong with it  But you know we do  See I'm good  Move on to someone else  When we do the blogs  And stuff  People will say  Like they watch the show  And they go  To the office of weight  What  Did you come up with it  He's waiting for you to ask him  No I just hoard weird stuff  Like  I hoard emails  That compliment my large genitals  You did ask Robin  Where did you get that from  Like how could even  How could someone even 
[03:28:00]  Think that up  Like  No that's  Because sometimes  You just tell the truth  Sometimes you just  Tell the truth  Robin  Jimmy's very quick  And funny  But sometimes  You just tell the truth  Oh my god  He's pretty proud of himself  For that one  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Well I gotta go  I don't think I really collect  I certainly don't hoard  Time on this show  Oh my  Look at the time  Are we done already  Well I gotta go  I gotta go  The time flies by 
[03:28:30]  When Rob and Zazio's here  You can stick with  The show with Sam  Because Sam  I was gonna say this  He's got some weird shit  Going on  Really  He's the one you wanna talk to  What's going on  I don't know  I had a time  He has a wrestling  Doll collection  Collection  Collection  Oh look at the day  Which has taken over  His parents house  Yeah  It's his collection  But they have to  They have to collect  His shit for him  And he doesn't really  Like eat  Anything  Why not  I don't like it  Are you afraid 
[03:29:00]  He eats chicken nuggets  No no no  It's like specific  He eats like an 8 year old  He looks like he's 8  I mean  That's why I like him  He doesn't like steak  He doesn't eat steak  He doesn't  Yeah  Just chicken and pizza  Chicken and pizza  No joke  That's it  It's like a child  And peanut butter  And that's about it  Do you eat pizza  With chicken and peanut butter on it  No  Robin  You don't combine it  Mention basic foods  He likes peanut butter  He likes to put on dog ears  No no pasta  No pasta  He doesn't eat pasta  Who doesn't eat pasta  Thank you 
[03:29:30]  Everyone  Really  His mother has damaged him  So badly  Who doesn't eat pasta  She told him he was special  No steak  She tolerated his nonsense  Instead of slapping him  Yes  He shouldn't have slapped me  I was a good boy  I just didn't like pasta  Make him eat  We forced him eat steak  For the first time  He threw it up  Well not threw it up  But spit it out  Spit it out  Yeah spit up on it  Yes  Which he should have done  With other stuff  But instead he swallowed it  Made a hungry boy noise  What  Robin  Now here's the question  I know Sam pretty well  And he's not suffering  By not eating this stuff 
[03:30:00]  But I  Me and a lot of people  Looking in  We get frustrated  Like do you understand  What you're missing  But he says he's not  Missing anything  And I believe it  But what is that based on  Yes he's not missing anything  I don't know  Except talents  I mean both  But I'm not going to get sick  Like I'm not going to get food poisoning  But I'll  Like psychologically  I won't start gagging  It might be the texture  Gagging  People have texture issues  Right  They do right  Yeah yeah yeah  Definitely  People have texture issues  But you know  You're not interested  In getting rid of this 
[03:30:30]  Not in the  I couldn't be less  Interested  Really  He doesn't give a fuck about it  Nice steak  Oh man  Nope  No  Nice bowl of creamed corn  Yes  Oh my god  Some nice fucking dry rice  Wait you don't eat potatoes  Mass potatoes  I only eat raw potatoes  What  I forgot about that  Me on Monday night to eat  They're little wrestler potatoes  But I mean  Even  Who doesn't  Who doesn't eat potatoes  Raw potatoes  Only raw  I mean like french fries  Yeah I eat french fries  And raw potatoes 
[03:31:00]  That's it  Ugh  As far as potatoes  I don't know  You can see the look  On my face  I know  You know how awful  Raw potatoes are  They're terrible  They're horrendous  They're salt  Yeah put a little salt  On them  They're crunchy  Yeah a little raw potato  I can get into  It's good  It's delicious  It's not delicious  It's a little starchy  But good  That's what his mother  Would give him  If they're starchy  Sammy I want you to be healthy  And she'd feed him raw potato  Do you know what this is based on  It's too starchy  And it's too jughead  You know I don't think  We're going to figure out  This one right now  But I do have a clinic  I don't know  What do we see  Why would I go to a clinic 
[03:31:30]  To see he doesn't feel  Like he's suffering  I know  So why fix someone like that  Yeah you don't need to  Just so you're happier  You know that's probably  Why he has so much hair  As he you know  Eats potatoes  Potatoes  It's like the eyes  Of the potato  Coming out of him  We'll just be dead  In three years  From having a diet  Consisting mainly  Of bagel bites  Yeah  That's not true  One can only hope  Robin I gotta go  Alright  Thanks guys  Maybe it continues  With somebody  I don't know  But I want to make sure  We get the big plug  Yes  You're going to have  A best seller on your hands here  The hoarder in you  How to live a happier

[03:32:30]  It affected you the most  No  No  No  It's just a regular episode  I mean I'd say  Like at the end of the day  Chicken Hoarders  Is still like the top  That probably affected me  The most  But there's one coming up  That's pretty bad  There's one coming up  That's pretty intense  So yeah  Stay tuned  I think I know what it is  I don't want to give it away  Oh Jimmy  Yeah what is it Jimmy  Guy hoards llamas  Llamas  Do you know what  And he shaves them  Was there a guy  Who was hoarding  He was in Buffalo  And he was hoarding tickets

[03:35:00]  Thank you  See you guys tomorrow  Robin Zazio  Get a new club  The O.P. and Anthony show  Is available later today  With Sirius XM On Demand  You've heard about it  You've waited four  Long  Hours  For it  Finally the moment is at hand  After O.P. and Anthony live  Is coming up  Next  And now 
[03:35:30]  The O.P. and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After O.N.A. Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  This is CM Punk  And you're listening to  After O.P. and Anthony live  With Sam Roberts  That's right  My pal CM Punk  You know what CM Punk does  When he sees me  He goes like this  Hey Sam  Good to see ya  You don't do that  To a stranger  Do you  After O.P. and Anthony live 
[03:36:00]  I felt like such a big shot  Last night  Cause  You know  Mick  Do we have that  Does somebody have that disc  Sal  Maybe you have that  Did you  You might have just taken it  Can I  Get that clip of Mick Foley  Talking about Amy Schumer  Last night  Felt like a big shot  Cause  I'm listening to Mick Foley  See Amy Schumer  Dated this wrestler  Dolph Ziggler  Uh  That's been  I think she went on  Howard Stern and talked about it  It's public information  Now  She's banging him and everything  And uh 
[03:36:30]  It ended up  You know  All over all the wrestling sites  Once Amy  Let that become publicly known  And so last night  We played it briefly  On the show today  But this is what  They were doing a promo together  Mick Foley was on Raw  And he was doing a promo  With Dolph Ziggler  The wrestler that  Amy Schumer dated  And  Mick Foley is a  Aspiring comedian himself  Obviously a fan  Of comedy  And comedians  So he knows very well  Who Amy Schumer is  A while back  He was tweeting her all the time  So uh  Yeah  Dolph Ziggler and Mick Foley 
[03:37:00]  Had a confrontation  And this is how it ended  Last night  Who do you got  I'm going with  Whoever wins the voting tonight  And their partner  King  Amy Schumer says hello  I was so hoping  When I watched that  As Dolph Ziggler  Is walking away  Mick Foley goes  Amy Schumer says hello  Big name mention  I mean that's like  The biggest show in cable  So  Big name mention  For Amy Schumer 
[03:37:30]  But  I felt like such a big shot  Cause you know  I was talking about  Being buddies with CM Punk  I texted Mick Foley  Cause I said  Look Mick  Cause I'm not  I don't text these guys  While the show's on  I watched the show  As a fan  But at that moment  I had to  Find out  Mick please tell me  Whether or not  You just improv'd that line  And he absolutely did  Eric you were watching it  Yeah  And I'm just filling  Fez's back here  I'm just filling him  And what happened  Cause he hasn't seen it yet  That is  He absolutely  Like  You know  The promo was written  However it was written 
[03:38:00]  But Mick Foley  Just threw that in  At the end  As Dolph Ziggler  Was walking away  Yeah  I wonder if it pissed  Dolph Ziggler  Like he's like  I don't need that  Being brought up again  He's never  I don't think that  The wrestler  Dolph Ziggler  Has ever actually  Talked about it  Amy Schumer's the one  Who came out  And talked about it  Yeah  Unfortunately  They didn't have  The camera on his face  He already walked  Off screen  When Mick said it  So you couldn't  See the reaction  Plus he would just  Start snarling  Or something  And you'd be like  Oh uh oh  Dolph Ziggler's upset  Think they'll work  An angle like AJ  And Cena  Where there's footage 
[03:38:30]  Of him and Amy  No I don't think so  I think that sounds  Completely ridiculous  But  They did make fun  Of someone having  A heart attack  So you never know  Yeah I guess  I guess  The show is getting  Unpredictable again  But always good to  Hear one of the  Regulars of this show  Get name mentioned  By another one  Of the regulars  Really Mick Foley  Are you mad that  You weren't the first  To be recognized yet  What do you mean  That Mick Foley  Didn't  All the buddies  That you have on there  No one dropped your name  On Raw yet  Well you know what  The thing is  The problem is  That many people  Who are on Raw  Know who I am 
[03:39:00]  Many people who are  Watching Raw  Still do not  So that's where  It becomes an issue  That they have to  Realize that the  Audience that exists  Outside of themselves  The audience that exists  Behind that camera  Not enough of them  Quite yet know  Who Sam Roberts is  Do you think he just  Would look in the camera  As he comes out  Point to his watch  And say Sam  It's clobbering time  I don't think he will  I don't think that's  Ever going to happen  Because it wouldn't  Make any sense  That's the problem  I will say this Eric  You might be the MVP  Today  My hat goes off to you 
[03:39:30]  How long was that  Segment today  I think 40 minutes  I was about to say  It must have been  40 or 45 minutes  We literally played  40 to 45 minutes  Of listener created songs  And you laughing  Well they were funny  All of them  About how fat  Some of them  About how dumb  Lazy  All these adjectives  About E-Rock  At first it seemed  Like you were like  Okay I'll just kind of  Breeze through this 
[03:40:00]  And move on with my day  At what point  Did it become a bit much  I think cut three  You think like  After the first two  That we've been  Playing for the past  Couple of weeks  And at what point  Did you realize  This isn't ever  Going to stop  Like what point  Did it feel like  You were being  Waterboarded  Again cut three  As it moved on  To past the  Rock and Robin  Parody  The fake  Computer voice one  And the 
[03:40:30]  Rage against  The Machine version  Because I have to  And that Rage against  The Machine version  Was a thing of beauty  Was it now  Very well produced  But still he's a shithead  Do you hold  A personal grudge  Against everybody  Who sends a song in  Well look  I understand  There's a prize  So everyone's  Trying to go with  I guess the  The easy way  To say  To try to win that money  So I can't fault them  For that  Because I  Oh we never said  What the prize was  Did we  For the  E-Rock prize  Yeah we don't know  What that one is  I don't know  What the E-Rock prize is  Well alright  Assuming it's money 
[03:41:00]  Or whatever the prize is  They're trying to win that  It better be money  What's it gonna be  Ham  I don't know  It could be  Gift cards to something  What cheesecake factory  I don't know  Christmas is coming up  We've got a lot of sponsors  That usually  If they'd have been  A Cracker Barrel gift card  You would have entered  I would have  Yeah I would have been  Doing it live in the studio  I'm so fat  I'm also lazy  Please give me Cracker Barrel  Yeah  Ooh Cracker Barrel  What did I miss  I love Cracker Barrel 
[03:41:30]  That's how we've seen  Roadshows with E-Rock  Because we stop at Cracker Barrel  How often  Every two hours  Whichever we can find  A fucking Cracker Barrel  We'll stop  Fuck it  So there's like  If you have lunch  And then 25 minutes later  There's another Cracker Barrel  Boom  We gotta stop right  Roland loves to  The wait for the table  Because he gets to walk  Through the old fashioned  Store portion  And he's just looking  At old fashioned candies  And  I can't imagine  Going to Cracker Barrel  With the two of you's  It's fantastic  I've been to dinner  With Roland  And I know  When he likes to celebrate  We had his birthday  Celebration dinner  On Saturday 
[03:42:00]  And he  I mean he orders  The whole menu  I mean he goes with people  Not for himself  He goes with people  He orders  As much food  As a table  Can possibly hold  Before the legs  Start to buckle  So I can't imagine  What those plates  At Cracker Barrel  Look like  I want to sample food  Yeah but you're not  Ordering samples  You're ordering full orders  Yeah but I share  With everybody  You do  If the place served  Alcohol it would be perfect  Roland would be in heaven  With that rocking chair  Fuck I'll never leave  No alcohol at Cracker Barrel 
[03:42:30]  No  That's her downfall  I will say though  My hat goes off to  E-Rock for  Did it feel like torture  Because I would have  I was looking at your face  And it seemed like  Psychological warfare  And like to have  Your shortcomings  Melodically replayed to you  Over and over again  For 45 minutes  Can't be a pleasant experience  No  It's not  You sitting in here  And not laughing at  The production  Or the writing style 
[03:43:00]  Or the content  Your laugh was  Strategically placed  To show emphasis  On parts that were  Really cruel  And you kept saying  What?  That was well written  It was very funny  I know what you were doing  But that's the part  That made me laugh  And when I turned  The headphone volume up  I think you saw me do that  Because you started laughing  Even more  Just so it would  Come in over the audio  No I did not  Oh bullshit  I did not laugh  So you could hear me  In your headphones  I did  But the cruel things  Are the parts  That make me laugh  The most  No  When you have to  Accent it 
[03:43:30]  Like when sitcoms  Show you  Where the laugh track is  To emphasize a joke  That's what you were  Doing in here  And then if you had  Walked in the studio  I would have gone  Woooo  So yeah  Sam the sitcom audience  I mean  He killed himself  I would have snapped  I know right  You did  You almost did  You kicked the glass  Yeah  I have enough of shit  When Sam called you fat  You kicked the glass  I kicked and pointed  I said enough  Why didn't you  You said enough  It was funny though 
[03:44:00]  Because you said enough  Before it even started  Like you know to nip  That shit in the butt  Fuck it  If you want to throw it down  I'll throw it down  Right  That was just a taste  Because I go  I guess maybe Roland's  Fatter than E-Rock  And then all of a sudden  Roland's kicking the glass  And I go okay  I don't know  And he's giving you  The finger to come outside  Yeah  Yeah  I go alright  I know where you park  You guys can be as fat  As you want to be  I don't care who's fatter  I know where you park  But your office  Is right next to him  No you can't  HR issue  Outside it's free game  No it's not  That's still  They got shit  They got Sandy 
[03:44:30]  To worry about  NYPD  You're mine boy  Now the time  To fuck up people  They're still trying  To put power back on  I'm gonna rip your face off  Southern justice  Yes  That sounds like  Enough  And enough  It was so funny though  Because it was like  One little Rolandism  And that's the difference though  Like Roland  How long would you put up with  If somebody  If we had a full disc  I would start singing  Songs about everybody  You would  Yeah  I'd be  Don't don't don't  Don't  They'd start saying  The worst things ever  That come to my mind  You would attack  Everybody in the room  If they come at me 
[03:45:00]  Whoever  Whoever made that  Production  Yeah that's  What if it's just  Like  The fans  The fans  They're making  Well I will  Say who did it  And I will take my time  Googling  And get some information  And make songs  About their family  You've seen how he reacts  You've seen how he reacts  To Twitter and Instagram  Their kids  Their lives  You really take this stuff personally  Or then I'll find out  Where they work  And just like  Do prank calls  All day to their office  So then how do you  I can't believe  I personally  You take this stuff  How do you  Then  Look at E-Rock 
[03:45:30]  Who's like  Kind of just sitting there  And being like  He's pissed  But he's not doing anything  He's a bigger man than I am  Yeah  I am a child  I do not  E-Rock  Are you technically  A bigger man  See what he's doing Roland  I'm just asking  Another  Sly fat joke  I mean for him to  Put up  I mean it's tough  I don't know how he did it  I have to imagine  That it's gotta be  I don't think I could do it  I mean after 10 minutes  I'll be like  Okay  I'll just start  Getting naked in the booth  And take a shit  I'm like alright  Is this what you want  Make a song about that 
[03:46:00]  How I get naked  And shit in the booth  It's for the show  Then you go crazy  Yeah it's on the air  So it's alright  If they were playing songs  About you  You would take off  All your clothes  And start shitting  If I lose my mind  Yeah  That would be the greatest day  On the show  How long would it take you  Minutes wise  Because E-Rock lasted  About 45 minutes  Before you start  Taking your clothes off  And shitting  10 minutes  10 minutes  So you've got a half hour  Of naked shitting to do  I just sit there naked  Is this what you want  And they'll be like  What no  I don't know why  You could get that opinion 
[03:46:30]  How could you draw  That conclusion from this  And you'll be like  I'm shitting  I don't hear you  I'm shitting  And then they go  Hey you can't do that  I'm sorry  I lost my mind  Because of the abuse  I was taking  From the listeners  Yeah  And they'll be like  Roland  You're still naked  Why are you in my office  Nude right now  And you'll be like  I'm also shitting  Do you know how cute dogs are  When they poop  Look at me  That's so cute  I never thought of a dog  As cute  Yeah people do  When they're shitting  When they're shitting  They go look at the cute dog  And it shits 
[03:47:00]  People like twice  Is that what happens Eric  Do ladies walk by  And go look at the cute dog  And then the dog shits  Not that I'm aware of  Me neither  Yeah  What about Sal  Is Sal back there  No Sal  He's not answering the phone  He's hurt  He's in the back  I was with him  He's not having a good day either  Because they killed his one sheet  Yeah  Where's Sal  Where's Sal  He's tired of this  Yeah  What do you mean he's tired of this  He's been here for a cup of coffee  He said he's sick of it  I was like  He did  He said he's sick of it 
[03:47:30]  I'm not going to put words  Into his mouth  Let him come in here  And air his grievance  He's sick of it  Roland you think  Your opinion  Yeah  I think Sal hit the wall today  Like saying  Alright  Today was the wall  Eric do you think Sal hit the wall today  Your opinion  I think this is one of many walls  That he has hit  Yeah  Like I don't think this is the first time  He doesn't do well with criticism  Does he  Um  No  No  Because he  I don't think he takes it  As far as  A bit on the show 
[03:48:00]  Or constructively  Yeah  I totally go crazy  They'll help you  Well your advice would be what  To strip nude and shit  And just start going crazy  He would tell  He would egg Sal on  And say  Just start swinging blindly  At everyone in the room  I mean  Oh that's a good one  Close your eyes  And just start swinging  Well there's no reason  Do you think  Sal today's criticism  Was unwarranted  I don't know  What's wrong buddy  He's defeated  I don't know  It's just like  Everything I do  Is sucks  And it's wrong  So it's just like 
[03:48:30]  You get a little unmotivated  At times  You know  Yeah  Yeah  Are you gonna  Well  I mean I get that  Because if they keep telling you  No you're wrong  You're wrong  You're wrong  What the fuck do I do  I mean  Right  So now I do suck  But then it becomes  A self-fulfilling prophecy  No I mean  I tried doing a good job  There's just not that much info  Out there on that lady  You know what I mean  It's true  I mean did you have a copy of the book  No  He didn't  He didn't  No  Well  And I don't even  I don't fuck  I barely watch TV  I barely watch movies  And I have the job of  Doing the one sheets  Like you need to be involved 
[03:49:00]  With media  You need to be  You know  Well I mean  I did the one sheets  For probably like  Five years or so  And then  Responsibilities just  Piled up for me  Because I started  You know when I started  Doing the one sheets  I wasn't doing much  Because it's newish  But then responsibilities  Start piling up  And piling up  And lo and behold  I do not have the time  To dedicate to the one sheets  That I once did  So  Shit gets delegated  Right  So we start saying  Well who can  Who can do this  It's fine with me  I don't mind doing them 
[03:49:30]  I try  I try to put  Interesting things on there  But then like  You know  Where's the line  Like if you put  Something too obvious  Then it's like  Oh who the fuck  Why'd you put this on there  But then if it's not there  And then if it's not there  It's like  Well why the fuck  Wasn't it there  Right  And then it has to  All fit on one sheet  So what can you do  To improve  I don't know  I  I consulted you  About  Because I put some  Of your things on there  That you previously put there  The last time I did a one sheet  For Dr. Robin  It wasn't exactly in depth  And I'm not  I'm not saying 
[03:50:00]  You know  Yours was good  Or bad  I'm just saying  I tried to incorporate it  In addition to what  I was putting on there  Well if mine sucked  Roland  It's because I was doing  Some other shit  I know  You got other shows to do  What can you do  What can you do right  Yeah shit to do  Don't make me strip naked  And start shitting in here Roland  Yeah it's holders  So what do you think  In what direction  Should you go then  With the show  What  For ONA  Yeah  I don't know 
[03:50:30]  So it's just  Just not the job for you then  Uh  No I mean  It is the job for me  I'm just still  You know  It's  The ONA show  Is not something  You can just lightly  Jump into  You know  It's something that  Takes years  To  To find your groove  And to find your way  You know  Eric and Roland  Think  In their opinions  Just based on your  Just based on their  Observations of you  Yeah  You're a little fed up here  I'm not fed up  It's just  There are certain things  That uh  Being the new guy  You have to deal with  And it  It takes a toll on you 
[03:51:00]  Like what  Just always getting shit on  Yeah but do you think  That you're getting shit on  Because you're the new guy  Or do you think  You're getting shit on  Because your quality of work  Is lacking  It  It doesn't matter to me  I'm getting shit on regardless  So  Which should matter to you  Because  If you're getting shit on  Because you're the new guy  Then it's whatever  You just deal with it  But if you're getting shit on  Because your quality of work  Is lacking  Then that's a problem  That you have to deal with  I think regardless  Even if I do a good job  It doesn't matter  Well what's one time  You did a good job  That you got shit on  I can't really think 
[03:51:30]  Of anything now  But there's  There's certain  There's a certain  Element to the show  In which it  It preys on  Negativity  And you know  If you slip up on one thing  They're gonna fucking run with it  Eric Reddy has the  Angry Panda thing ready  Do you have it ready Eric  Don't get  It's one of those things  I do  Panda angry  Well you wanted an example  Yeah I just  I needed to know  And there was no way  Eric I've known you for a while  I'm not gonna take your word for it 
[03:52:00]  If you tell me you have it ready  Because you've lied before  I need an example  So I appreciate you doing that  I also like to think  In my head Sam  When I get shit on  I'm the new guy  It just helps me get through my day  That's a good point  I mean  Eric  Eric when you  First started getting shit on  I have an eight year career  On this right now  When you first started  Getting shit on  Did you think it was  Because you were the new guy  When I first started getting shit  I did  Yeah  It was because  There was other people  Here at the time 
[03:52:30]  That was specifically  Making it so  And then you realized  Then I started saying  And doing dumb things  So then it was warranted  Okay  Yeah  And now you realize  That  No he's picking  You're the most senior member here  Right  I mean you've been working  For the show longer than anybody  Yeah you're nine now  And who takes more shit than Eric  Nobody  So maybe it's not  Maybe it's not the new guy thing  It's like an uphill battle  Of just the further you get  No because  I don't get shit on 
[03:53:00]  Like Eric gets shit on  But you still get shit on  On a daily basis though  Yeah but I'm not sitting there  Being like  Oh  Oh they don't like my shit  I'm gonna stop  I don't  I haven't had that reaction once  It's just  You said it's unmotivating  Absolutely  But I don't fucking pout about it  It's just like  You fucking plow through it  And you go to the next day  I mean it's  There's nothing else you can do about it  Yes you can  You can say  Get naked and shit  You could  Well there's two schools of thought  No I don't act like that  I'm gonna give you my school of thought  And then I'm gonna give you  Roland's school of thought  My school of thought would be 
[03:53:30]  Okay  Look at what they said today  Right  And fix the problem  Okay  Or get naked and shit in the studio  Which one do you think  Is more likely for you to do  It's probably easier to get naked and shit in the studio  Way easier to get naked and shit in the studio  But  If you spend a little time doing it  Because you know what  They're not gonna go on the air  And be like  Sal  You're doing much better  But if you start handing in prep sheets  That you put a little more time into  I do  I put a lot of time into them 
[03:54:00]  How much time  You do those prep sheets before you leave here  What is that supposed to  What is that supposed to mean  That your prep sheets are done by 2 o'clock in the afternoon  No sometimes I do them if I'm home  If it's a weekend thing  I do them during the weekend  Most of the time you do your prep sheets here  Yeah for the most part  While you're at work  Yeah  You're not really at work more than  Nine hours a day  Yeah about that  So you  I mean  So with all your other stuff  You're kind of just squeezing the prep sheets in  I wouldn't say that at all  I dedicate time  In my schedule throughout the day  How much time did you work on the Robin 
[03:54:30]  Dr. Robin watch  That one  I don't know  Not that long  Right  So  But there's only so much you can find on that lady  You know  Like there's like  Oh she was on Hoarders  Oh you put that on  Oh you don't put that on  Doesn't matter  You're gonna get shit on  You should probably put it on  Some place  But  What I'm saying is  If you go home  You know  You do your work here  You go home  Give yourself an hour  And then you actually start doing research  Not to say  Okay this is one of my assignments  That I have to complete  Before I leave for the day  But  To the 
[03:55:00]  You know  To the big one  Oliver Stone  Yeah  Like  What the fuck am I gonna put on that one  Everything  I mean  The Oliver Stone one  And make it like  The directing  The directing  The directing  The directing  Oliver Stone is probably easier  Because you just figure out  What's the most interesting  Like think about it this way  If you were gonna interview  Dr. Robin  Yeah  Would you have been prepared  To do that today  Would have been prepared  No  Right  You're the guy making the one sheet though  Yeah but I'm not an interviewer  Or a broadcaster  Yeah but you wouldn't have been prepared  Because you don't know anything about it 
[03:55:30]  Right  Right  How is the guy doing the research  Not knowing anything about  The person doing the interview  You should be able to  I shouldn't be the guy doing it  I don't know  You should be able to  After you get  You should be able to get enough information  That you could do the interview  Not that you know  You're gonna set the world on fire  And ask the most compelling questions  But at least  Have a conversation with this person about them  Right  And if you can't talk to them about them  Then you probably didn't do a great prep sheet  I don't think that's the issue  Like I said again 
[03:56:00]  The issue is  Is managing what  To put on  And what not to put on  Well what did you not put on?  Uh  Anything I couldn't find on her  I put on everything I was able to find  She doesn't have that much info on it  But you didn't look that long  I did  I was digging through the internet  I was finding like these ghetto ass websites  From way back when  Eric  Didn't he just tell me  That he didn't spend too long  On the Dr. Robin one sheet?  Because there wasn't much to find  That's what I'm  That's what I'm  Elaborating on  Dr. Robin thinks there was more to find  Okay  And when you got Dr. Robin in here  I've gotten shit on 
[03:56:30]  For one sheets before  Yeah  No  Finish your thought  Then I'll say  No  I've gotten shit on  For one sheets before  But  I don't  I can't just go back  And be like  Whoa  Jim's being an asshole  That's not what I'm saying  I go  Remember my  David Duchovny one sheet?  Holy shit  Roland got shit on  I made three boo-boos  Roland looked up  The IMDB  For Edward Norton  And he sent them to me  As facts about  David Duchovny  And they go  So David  I hear you're gonna be  In The Incredible Hulk  And David's like  I don't have a fucking idea  What you're talking about 
[03:57:00]  Right now  And they're like  Oh  Were you in Fight Club?  And he goes  No of course I wasn't  In Fight Club  And they go  Who wrote this?  And that was the time  That I could be like  Well I wrote it  But Roland sent me  A ton of facts about him  Those are the ones  You're reading  And then Roland was like  Hey  I made the boo-boo  I like David Duchovny  And then it was okay  But  That's not what happened here  Do you think  The one cheats  That you  You should be  As the new guy here  Just concentrating 
[03:57:30]  On putting out  Exceptional work  All the time  Not good work  Not decent work  Not just being like  Okay I'll do  What they tell me to do  But it should be  Exceptional work  All the time  Because you're  The new guy  Everybody here  Everybody here  I could have taken  A shot at Eric  Everybody here  Has at least  Some exceptional work  That they've done  Right  Because we've been here  For long enough  To get it done  You know  Maybe not Eric  But everybody here  Has  I'm only kidding  Sal made a face at me 
[03:58:00]  What's some work  That you've done  That's exceptional Eric  What are you proud of  I sat here for 40 minutes  While jingle contest  Went on  That's exceptional work  On Eric's part  He didn't get naked  He didn't shit in the studio  He was exceptional  And Opie went to him  And said  What did you think  Of that one Eric  And song after song  After song  He said in that same  Eric Nagel voice  That was very well done  It was great  That's exceptional work  You  Seem like you're more like 
[03:58:30]  Well  I'm gonna do  What they tell me  Not the minimum  But certainly  Not go above and beyond  I'll do  What the assignment is  But I don't need to get  The extra credit points  On this  Just a fucking one sheet  What do those guys  Need me for  But if that's the case  If they don't need you  Then you know  There's a lot of money  That could be allocated  Elsewhere  For instance  Sam Roberts and Roland Campos  Just a couple ideas  Right Roland  I'm awake  What's going on 
[03:59:00]  You know what I mean  Sure  Am I right or wrong  You're right  You're right  Bob has an idea  Bob in Illinois  Oh great  We're gonna go to the call  Well Bob has a good idea  I'm sure they have the best ideas  Yeah  I know how to  Increase his morale  And job efficiency  Every Monday morning  Give him a little  Participation trophy  And a juicy juice box  And tell him how good  Of a job he did  Oh that's a great idea  Sal appreciation day  If we give you  A quarter of a tangerine 
[03:59:30]  And a participation trophy  At the end of each work day  Will you be more motivated  To get stuff done  No  You won't  I'd never ask  Am I asking for rewards  Have I ever said  I need an acknowledgement  I want a reward  Fuck yeah  You want the  Fuck yeah  Quarter of a tangerine  Give me something  And a trophy too  What about little Capri Sun  I'll take it  Okay  Capri Sun  Capri Sun  Look  We're working on you right now  Sal  We'll work on my pronunciations  Of children's juices after  You're the first 
[04:00:00]  To usually call people out  On shit like that  But what I'm trying to say  Is I don't need  I think I've made it very clear  I like doing things  Behind the scene  I don't necessarily want  To be brought up on air  And stuff like that  You know  So I don't need  To be recognized  Any further  Wrong show  Then this isn't the job for you  Go work at the morning mashup  They never talk about  Their producer  They only got two minutes  To talk  You know what I mean  They gotta talk about  Lindsay Lohan  It's a different nature  Sam  What if we just ask  The guests to bring  Their own prep sheet  Would you like that Sal  No  And from now on  And I'm not complaining  About doing the prep sheet 
[04:00:30]  Roland  What about that  Maybe from now on  You talk to the publicist  And say  Oh  And when Oliver Stone  We have Oliver Stone  Yeah  Tomorrow  Tomorrow right  It's a Pendulet  Chris Tucker  And Oliver Stone  You got a lot of work  To get done before  Two o'clock  I've already got  I already did the  Chris Tucker one  I'm halfway through  The Pendulet one  Is the Chris Tucker one good  My friend's walking by  I have some good shit  Well  Well  Well  Wave him  He's coming in  Guy  Thierry  Well 
[04:01:00]  Well  Well  Oh my god  I walk into the lair  Is that what it is  How's it going buddy  How can I be mad at you  You apologized to me twice last time  And one of them I think was legitimate  They were all legit  So  Don't only put two sandwiches here  He will not be happy  Alright  Now you're looking out for me  Well I was just trying to give  Our buddy  Our  New guy  Sal  A pep talk  Cause he's got  Like  You're a guy  Who  You've created a brand  Around yourself 
[04:01:30]  Correct  Yeah  I mean  Yeah  Guy  Not intentionally  But it just kind of falls into place  Well it's got to be difficult  You open a restaurant in Times Square  Yeah  Giant restaurant  It's got to be very difficult  A lot of work goes into that  Yeah  A lot of work  A lot of good people  A lot of folks focused on the goal  Our guy Sal  Where's Sal  Where is Sal  I don't know why he left  He always leaves  Get Sal back in here  What are you doing brother  Oh you're alright  That looks delicious  Those are for you  Those are little Scooby snacks  Oh thank you  Yes 
[04:02:00]  I love his food  I appreciated the support  You showed us in the first week  First day  Three days  Second day  Fourth day  Ninth day  Twelve  Fifteen days  Roland told me  I didn't see you yesterday  So I was wondering if you're okay  I'm okay yeah  You come from a birthday yeah  Roland told me he was the first regular  At your Times Square restaurant  He did good  He was even there before we opened  He was just outside  No it was the night before  He was just sampling all the beers  Making sure that every beer was okay  And they were delicious  Yes they were  We do some awesome handcrafted beer  Even their cocktails are amazing  Single handedly responsible  For getting Roland right back on the wagon 
[04:02:30]  Because he was trying to  He was like I'm going to start  Dieting a little bit  I'm going to drink a little less  But then when you gave him  The open invite to your restaurant  Roland was like alright  I'm not going to do any of that  I was impressed with how many  Of the times you turned down  All those free beverages  That were served by those  Fantastic bartenders  Is that  Oh thank you  Did you turn a lot down Roland  No  Way to roll with that Roland  What did you say Eric  Yes we stayed away from the bar  Just to make room for all the food  That was going around the bar  There was copious amounts 
[04:03:00]  Fantastic  This is Sal right here  What's up Sal  So we got problems with Sal  Because he keeps handing in bad work  And he keeps getting shit on  For handing in the bad work  Is this like school  Like bad paperwork  Or what kind of work  Does he hand in  Eric do you have an example  Of his production  That you could run in the other room  And play for Guy Fieri  Because I want you to hear  Like an example of production  Today we had Dr. Robin  From Hoarders in here  And he did a terrible job  With her prep sheet  Oh I love Hoarders  Right  It's a great show 
[04:03:30]  You screwed that up  He screwed it up  He took the sandwich away from him  He screwed it up  Have the production if you want  Yeah listen to  This is the production that he made  Don't get the panda angry  I mean  Is this Ghostbusters?  Yeah it's not the sound  A panda makes  The voice doesn't sound angry  What is that part about?  I don't know Sal  We've exhausted this many times  What is it about?  It's awful  That's exactly what it is  No explain who to Guy  Explain to Guy Fieri 
[04:04:00]  He doesn't know  I'm sorry but this now  Is actually a little funny  Yeah  Explain to Guy Fieri  What was going on  What was going on in your mind?  Well it was Roland getting angry  And it was a Tom Papa  Was calling you the angry panda  Okay but what does the growl  Have to do with pandas?  It was just a shit sound effect  Sounds like a lion  Yeah it was completely wrong  Then why hand it in?  I don't know  Did you go to school for this?  I went to school for music  Okay 
[04:04:30]  Not radio at all  Did you really try  Or did you just half ass it?  That  I think it's been made pretty clear  That I tried to hand in something good  You know  Okay you did try  I mean I  Listen I gotta give you credit there  I couldn't make anything that good  Yeah but you don't work here  Like if you worked here  We'd be like Guy  Why would you hand that in?  Why did you do that?  Yeah why did you serve bologna and tuna fish?  Exactly  Yeah exactly  Two of your favorites  I just  Neither one  I just got told on my headphones  We only have a minute left  Okay  So you're doing a great thing at your restaurant 
[04:05:00]  Yep  Is it just for today?  It was yesterday and today  Okay  50% of all the proceeds  Of all the sales  Are going to the American Red Cross  They've had a major undertaking  I mean the devastation that's happened here on the east coast  New Jersey  I mean just  It's unbelievable  And the support that's needed  The Red Cross is coming through huge  And I think that  Sometimes there's a misunderstanding  That the Red Cross is funded by the government  Or  They need money  They need donations  They need support  They need workers  They need anything they can get 
[04:05:30]  And so for us to make a financial contribution is one thing  But just to raise awareness  That everybody can support the Red Cross  And everybody can help out  And there's still folks without power  Still folks without water  Still folks without  You know  Houses at this point  I mean it's  That's tough  And we're coming into the holidays  And it's starting to get cold  I mean all this stuff's happening  So yeah  We had a great event last night  We had record-breaking numbers  So that's great  Because a lot of money going to them  And we're also doing it today and tonight  At Guy's American Kitchen and Bar on 44th  There it is  And Roland 
[04:06:00]  Will you be there tonight?  Hell yeah  Hell yeah you will  So check out the restaurant  Thanks guys  Thanks  You're stopping by  Thanks  Hey good luck with the angry pandan  You know  Make it up to him  You know  Make it up to him  And go home and work on  You know  I don't know how you would make it any better  But I mean just good luck on that  He doesn't work hard  He just doesn't work hard  He fails  And then he goes  They're picking on me  Because I'm the new guy  And then he fails again  He doesn't improve his craft  This is turning into a show  I'm telling you right now  GettingYourAssKick.com  Thank you Guy Fieri
