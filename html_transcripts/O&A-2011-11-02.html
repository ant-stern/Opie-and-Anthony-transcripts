<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Colin Quinn’s satirical Twitter rant accusing Will Ferrell of stealing the *Anchorman* concept and having a drug problem.  Opie, Anthony, and producer Jimmy analyzed the media’s uncritical reporting of Quinn’s jokes as fact, highlighting the failings of modern journalism.  This segued into Opie's aggressive but generous Halloween candy distribution and a discussion on trick-or-treating etiquette, followed by Anthony’s awkward experiences with masseuses. The show then delved into the Occupy movement, contrasting Opie’s experience at Occupy Philly (filled with homeless and drug-addicted individuals, corroborated by caller Brian) with the New York City protests.  The hosts heavily criticized Michael Moore's participation, highlighting his hypocrisy as a wealthy celebrity criticizing the 1%.  Caller Finley contributed a story about a homeless man, "The Shit Monster," encouraged to go to Zuccotti Park.  The segment concluded with further criticism of Moore's avoidance of questions about his wealth.

The conversation then shifted to the Occupy Wall Street movement, with continued, highly offensive criticism of those who profited from government bailouts and Michael Moore.  The hosts discussed videos they’d made highlighting protesters’ seemingly hypocritical actions.  The discussion then turned to the Kim Kardashian-Kris Humphries divorce, deemed a publicity stunt by the hosts, along with broader criticism of the Kardashian family’s reality show and their wealth, using crude and sexually explicit language.  Bill Burr was mentioned as a scheduled guest.  Jim Norton contributed sexually explicit anecdotes and promoted a DVD on Jersey City prostitution, while Jim Brewer shared a story about his father’s incontinence.

The show continued with more discussion of the Kardashian family, including speculation about Khloe Kardashian’s paternity and crude, sexually explicit commentary on her physique.  Kris Jenner’s prior guest appearance was mentioned.  The conversation then returned to Colin Quinn and the media’s misinterpretation of his Will Ferrell tweets.  Quinn phoned in to discuss the ensuing media frenzy.  Bill Burr, present in the studio, joined the conversation.  Segments featuring "Uncle Paul" and a humorous advertisement for Anthony Cumia's self-help guide to self-oral sex were aired.  Justin Bieber played unintentionally as background music.  The segment concluded with discussion of Burr’s Scandinavian tour, including his Hitler bit, Jim Norton’s aversion to European tours and Scandinavian women, despite their attractiveness.

Bill Burr, alongside Jim Norton, then joined the broadcast.  Their conversation centered on Burr’s international tour experiences, including anecdotes from Europe and Scandinavia, a negative encounter with a Copenhagen cab driver, and accidentally calling Sweden Switzerland.  Burr expressed his general dislike for European tours.  Numerous musical interludes featured 80s hip-hop and hair metal, prompting discussion about the evolution of hip-hop.  A previous segment featuring Norton in a dress was also mentioned.  A brief, incomplete call from Colin Quinn led to the scheduled interview with Ace Frehley.

The Ace Frehley interview covered his time with KISS, including dangerous stage shows, falls from platform shoes, encounters with fans, drug and alcohol use (and the resulting spread of crabs through the band), his departure from KISS, his relationship with Gene Simmons (detailing Simmons' hygiene and behavior), the band's early work, the decision to remove their makeup, and Frehley's post-KISS career, including Frehley's Comet.  Promotional information for his book, "No Regrets," was given.  Post-interview, the hosts discussed the booking process and played clips of previous, tense interactions between the show and Gene Simmons.

The show's final segment began with humorous impressions of Gene Simmons' alleged sexual performance, followed by a discussion on attracting women and a sponsored segment for Steven Singer's Argentium silver jewelry, using the tongue-in-cheek website "IHateStevenSinger.com".  The hosts discussed Jennifer Hutt's reaction to online criticism, and a recent Susan Boyle studio visit.  They recounted humorous anecdotes from the Ace Frehley interview, including Jim Norton meticulously recapping his actions of replacing the cap on Frehley's water bottle, and the differences between interviewing major celebrities versus musicians they admired.  The segment ended with show plugs, including upcoming stand-up shows, sponsorships (including Trojan condoms), and social media information. Jim Norton was present in the studio for this segment.

[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so appalling, so appalling, so offensive, yet, so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts, and we're experts, and we're experts, and we're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  You get a dang open hand.  You don't listen to a dang open hand.  Stop it.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, God damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Is this light FM?  Turn that shit up.  Oh, shit.  If we're going to have this dramatic music, shouldn't it be loud?  It probably is loud to the listeners.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you know how the sound is here.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  How's everybody?  All right.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:05:00]  It's a Wednesday morning?  Is it?  Yeah, I think so.  It's so weird to take a Tuesday off.  That's the dumbest day to take off.  Is it?  It really is just stupid.  What's the bestest day?  Got to be Friday.  Obviously, a Monday or a Friday.  I think Friday's the best.  Monday, second best.  And then a Wednesday.  And a Wednesday.  And that's it.  You bridge it right to Thursday, which is the day before Friday.  You break up the week.  But taking off a Tuesday or a Thursday is just stupid.  Yeah.  But I did the Halloween thing down in Philly. 
[00:05:30]  How'd that go?  It was wonderful.  What are you laughing at already, Jimmy?  Just reading the Colin Quinn tweets there.  Oh, isn't it great?  Oh, my God.  That guy is the funniest fucking guy.  Can we get him on the air?  He's out of his mind.  Did we try to get him on the air?  He's big news today.  We should get him on the air.  Can I ask where this is?  Is this from one of the papers?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or it's online.  Soon to be in the papers. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, Colin took over Twitter yesterday, man.  He's the king.  Yeah, he was the guy.  Colin Quinn is the king.  He's the guy.  The king of the Twitter.  Was he really?  Fuck yeah, man.  He was making news and everything.  It's hilarious.  He was making blog sites.  What, Huffington, I guess?  Yeah, Huffington went for it.  Oh, my God.  It went to the mail online at the UK.  Yes.  What dummies people are.  Look at that headline.  I was into a lot of bad drug stuff. 
[00:06:30]  No, he was.  He saw that Will Ferrell stole Anchorman concept.  Colin Quinn jokes that Will Ferrell stole Anchorman concept and takes drugs.  But they don't think it's a joke.  No.  Because the media is stupid.  Well, it says jokes there.  So that kind of...  This article came out later.  It's like three paragraphs in.  It says, however it appears they just failed to spot a good-natured,  bit of joshing.  Joshing.  A good-natured bit of joshing, don't you know?  Yes. 
[00:07:00]  Yes.  Colin Quinn.  Comedian.  But this is late in the story.  Because a lot of people were buying into it for a while.  What Jim's reading is from the Hollywood Reporter.  And the only...  Oh, God.  And the only reason they know it was a joke is because Colin got scared.  Yeah.  Colin started going, oh, fuck.  Maybe this isn't a good idea.  Maybe I'll get in trouble.  Look at the headline on Huffington Post.  Yeah.  Colin Quinn rips Will Ferrell on Twitter.  He stole Anchorman.  Has a drug problem. 
[00:07:30]  Colin said...  Did he say it on the show?  He was just...  Did he say to CNN?  Like, you guys are so dumb.  Like, I'm scared that you don't get it.  Right.  Yeah.  Did some of the quotes...  Read it, Jimmy.  Read it.  I couldn't believe...  That's what...  It just made me laugh.  Fuck my Halloween story.  Who gives a fuck?  This is way better.  I just...  It hit me.  He goes, uh...  Ferrell recently received the Mark Twain Award, and it seems Quinn was not a fan of that.  It says, uh...  Anybody see Will Ferrell at Mark Twain Awards last night?  Great for him, I guess.  Like, who takes that seriously? 
[00:08:00]  No, I know.  Who the fuck takes that seriously?  No, I'm happy for Will.  We never really got along at SNL because he took so many of my ideas, but he continued.  That's his whole...  He took so many of my ideas.  And the whole thing when...  What's the Lorne Michaels one?  I'm gonna get...  That's in two, and it's the one that made me laugh.  Yeah, that one's hilarious.  He goes, then Quinn escalated his comments by saying, Will was into a lot of bad drug  stuff, and I don't know if he still is.  Actually, not true.  I happen to know he's still very much so.  Then Quinn goes on to target Lorne Michaels. 
[00:08:30]  Target.  He goes, uh...  The years at SNL, Lorne really was kind of messed up over various things, and I was the  shot caller.  He's saying he produced SNL during the years he was there.  And I was the shot caller.  He called the shots.  Who the fuck believes that?  Apparently a lot of dumb people.  Wow, we are really dumb.  Oh, then the last one, he goes, uh...  He goes, uh...  Oh, he said a couple hours later, Quinn seemed to apologize for his remarks, but at the same  time threw in another zinger. 
[00:09:00]  I feel bad about the whole Will Ferrell...  I feel bad about the Will Ferrell comments.  I'll never mention him again if he pays me my residuals for the whole Anchorman concept.  I put...  What?  Business...  Dumb motherfucker.  Business insider, why?  Yeah, the headline says, Colin Quinn may have just accused Will Ferrell of stealing  the concept for Anchorman from him.  I hope Will Ferrell gets it.  He has to.  Oh, yeah.  He totally gets it.  He absolutely gets it.  Yeah.  That's how famous Will Ferrell is, though.  Like, uh...  Movie line. 
[00:09:30]  Colin Quinn tweets that Will Ferrell had a bad drug problem.  Yeah, Will Ferrell's gotta fucking read that and just laugh his ass off like, fucking Colin.  You hope so.  I would think so.  You know what it is, though?  It's brilliant because, first of all, it's just funny on the surface.  It's funny shit to read.  But you dig down deeper and that's pure Colin is taking something like Twitter and showing  everyone how ridiculous it is and how easy it is to take something that is social networking 
[00:10:00]  and twist things around and actually make people believe anything.  And everybody wants to be first to print it.  Right, right.  Colin Quinn is saying that, you know, Will Ferrell is a drug addict and he stole Anchorman from  me.  They're like, fuck, we gotta get this up on our blog immediately.  And they're reporters, but nobody does any homework.  They just get these tweets sent to them.  They don't scroll back.  They don't care.  Insane tweets.  They're copy-pasters.  They're not reporters anymore.  They're copy-pasters.  That's exactly what you just said, Sam. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  They don't do any background checking at all.  They just go with it because they need to be the first one.  Un-fucking-believable.  They just don't care.  They don't...  Where are they?  Oh, you know how you know they're copy and paste?  We mentioned Patrice.  Bob Kelly is the one who actually said...  And it doesn't matter, like Bob Kelly said it, but they were saying Jim Norton said,  and they were using Bob Kelly.  Now, I know some guys don't know Bob's voice, so they couldn't tell the difference between  Bobby and I.  And I get that.  But when every...  When you see one printed, and then you see bop, bop, bop, all these other ones printed, 
[00:11:00]  it was like, all you're doing is reporting what they reported.  Like, you're doing no homework yourself.  You're doing no original work.  It's, like, fucking lazy, man.  Happens all the fucking time.  They're just lazy.  What else do they have to do during the day?  They're not doing a radio show.  All you have to do is, you know, fact check.  Like, they can't listen to audio themselves.  First of all, here it's two different voices.  But then just do their own homework and maybe come up with an angle themselves or use their  own words.  No.  Terrible fucking report.  Copy, paste, get it up on the site. 
[00:11:30]  Boom.  Move on.  Exactly it.  Unbelievable how gullible and just, yeah, complete lack of reporting.  Well, Colin said it.  And there's no accountability, which, you know, that's the biggest part.  Like, does it matter?  Is somebody going to get, oh, one of these news agencies going to get in trouble?  Or is the reporter going to catch heat from whatever superior they have because they printed  something that wasn't true or real or printed it like it was true? 
[00:12:00]  No.  Because everyone accepts the fact that if it's written down, even if it's on Twitter, it must  be true.  Well, the stakes are too high, so they're all in on it.  Stakes.  We've got any stakes back there.  Stakes are too high.  They're doing gambling all the time, just hoping, you know, what they just read is true  as they put it on their site.  Yep.  Uh, Sleeves has a Colin Quinn song.  That's what Coke Logic is telling me.  No one understands him.  Fa la la la la la la la la. 
[00:12:30]  Hair like he combed it with an M80.  Fa la la la la la.  Jay Moore does his voice.  Fa la la la la la.  Got skinny little legs.  Fa la la la la.  Breakable cancer fingers.  Fa la la la la.  Nobody likes him.  Fa la la la la.  He's a dirty fucking rosacea Irish face.  You can so break his fingers easily.  Oh, God, dude.  By looking at them.  Well, you know, we've got to hear the Sleeves' Colin Quinn song.  Oh, who wouldn't want to? 
[00:13:00]  From the Radio Ghost himself.  Sleeves.  Radio Ghost.  What does that mean?  Sleeves.com.  Chase some fucking leaves face down.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  Like, see, the last shot in that is him just going down the river face first.  You're leading the leaves by dead example.  Do, do, do.  You got it?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Oh, God.  Here it is.  It's buffering, by the way.  Someone's fired.  Is that really buffering?  It's buffering.  I've done things. 
[00:13:30]  I mean, we all have.  Am I right?  Right, Colin.  Completely right.  Terrible thing that can never be taken back.  This can never be taken back, Colin.  Ever.  It's ugly stuff.  Stuff that I keep saying never again.  Then what do you do?  When I wake up.  And what do you find upon waking? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, my God.  What is this?  He's using me on this one.  What is this?  And I'm a big fan of sleeves, but I'm exposing him.  In your body, see, Will Ferrell at Mark Twain Awards last night.  Great for him.  Not bitter, but just, you know.  What is he doing?  What is this?  Get it. 
[00:14:30]  Good for you.  Bill was in Toronto.  Bad drunk stars.  I don't know if he still is.  Actually, that's not true.  I happen to know.  He still is.  Very much so.  I have no idea what that was.  He was reading tweets.  I was actually liking that one.  Really?  By the way, Colin tweeted, I guess, at the end, to all media, etc. 
[00:15:00]  Will Ferrell was not on drugs at SNL.  I never even saw him smoke a joint.  Is this what it's come to?  With three question marks.  I guess he had to because it's like, he's kidding me.  But it's a great way to end the whole thing.  He was getting scared.  It exposes everybody.  Because Will would have fun with that.  He was getting scared.  He got some pressure from some people behind the scenes, I'm assuming.  Somebody just said, dude, you just got to say you're joking.  It's a great way to end it because it's not like, hey, I apologize for this. 
[00:15:30]  It's like, look, hey, idiots, do you even fucking get this?  I want to see more headlines.  Sam.  I was just reading some of his other tweets that didn't make the article.  Oh, really?  Right after he tweeted the Lord Michaels thing, he tweeted, there's things going on right  now, secret things, behind the scenes type stuff that I think will catapult me into the  best of the best.  And, uh, yeah, right on.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Holy shit.  Feel bad about the Will Ferrell comments.  I'll never mention him again if he pays me my residuals for the whole Anchorman concept.  He stole the concept.  He wants his residuals.  I don't like the fact that Sam read one that I just read.  Yes.  And did the same thing I did with the capital letters.  Put emphasis on it.  Oh, the whole...  Like that?  I don't like that.  Yeah.  And he repeated what I said.  Oh, boy.  What's going on with you today?  What's going on?  Oh, no.  Yeah, you would have been on Beretta's shoulder. 
[00:16:30]  Beretta referenced.  He's getting very antsy sitting there.  I see that.  You know who doesn't do that to him?  I see that.  Mother.  I'm sure he'll be doing antsy's jokes soon, too.  Oh, and gypsies.  Wait a minute.  It's him.  Yeah.  You've got to read the different tweets, Sam.  You're reading the same thing.  Detective Monahan heard that.  Jesus.  Ah, Quince, gee, I don't know.  She's only five.  Come on.  They look so nice when they're that young.  I'm the colonel.  I don't touch him.  I just look at him. 
[00:17:00]  Look at him.  Ah, shit.  That's a big one today.  We've got to get Colin on.  I didn't have no...  Someone I saw on Twitter said something.  Yeah.  I just hadn't seen Kyle's tweets.  I wasn't looking at Twitter yesterday.  Yeah.  God damn.  Yeah, it's...  It was just...  It was hilarious.  It's the perfect way to expose Twitter and expose these fucking idiots.  Whether it's just another guy tweeting that's sitting around and can't fucking understand sarcasm. 
[00:17:30]  Or these dumbass fucking people in the media.  There's a panic going on, though, man.  Because a lot of people on Twitter are getting the story before mainstream news.  They're getting it out there first.  So now, what do you do?  You've got to gamble.  But it's also a mixture of real journalism.  Well, not even real journalism.  Like mainstream media and just a blogger.  All of a sudden, it becomes the same fucking thing.  But break it down.  Colin's tweeting this crazy shit.  What do you do?  Do you try to call his people knowing that everyone else is reading Twitter and you know someone is going to grab it and go with it? 
[00:18:00]  So then you think to yourself, well, Colin isn't known to be this crazy, off-the-cuff type of guy.  He isn't in the mainstream.  So they go, fuck, we have to go with this.  That's what's going on there.  I don't have time to confirm it.  No, because someone else is going to grab it.  Someone else is just going to run with it anyway, so I might as well.  Right.  What?  What is that one?  No, just when you Google News him, once the articles about Will Ferrell stopped, the last Twitter fiasco that he started about Gaddafi is... 
[00:18:30]  He's brilliant.  And if you did a second of research, you would understand that Colin is never serious on Twitter.  Ever.  But why does he say it that way?  Sam says Gaddafi.  It's a G.  Gaddafi.  No!  Gaddafi.  There's a G right there.  Oh, my mother made the Gaddafi the way she made Gaddafi.  Melts in your mouth.  I think we all agree it's Gaddafi.  It's just spelled differently.  Yeah.  No, but it's a little bit of Gaddafi.  It puts some Zuccotti on that. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, the Zuccotti next to the Gaddafi.  My mother was the same way she could...  Every Sunday afternoon, you smell the Gaddafi in our house.  It would take up the entire room.  I'm a Gaddafi.  Does she slice it nice and thin?  Oh, you've got to slice the Gaddafi thing.  The thick pieces, yeah, you chew it.  It's like rubber.  It's like rubber.  My father taught me to respect her, and he punched her in the mouth.  He said, respect your mother.  And then he goes, shut up, Marie.  And he knocked her teeth down her throat, and she couldn't eat no Gaddafi. 
[00:19:30]  When the Gaddafi was cold, oh, my father would come out with a white beard with a little  Gaddafi stain on there.  And pada bing right in her fucking face.  And he said, I've got to go see my gomar and put some of a little Zuccotti in there.  Oh, he laughed.  Stashing the Zuccotti.  You fucking dago-wop, guinea-ass-hole.  Well, that's because Sam says it differently than everybody else.  I've never heard Gaddafi.  No one has.  It's never been said before.  Yeah, Sam. 
[00:20:00]  Well, then.  Say Gaddafi.  It's just spelled with a G in some parts.  Gaddafi.  See, Colin spelled it with a K.  Then I would have said Gaddafi.  It's just Gaddafi.  But CNN spelled it with a G, so then I say Gaddafi.  Why does CNN spell it with a G?  I don't know.  That would be the last place they spell it with a G, I'm thinking.  Fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, how was the trick-or-treating?  It wasn't bad.  They were pretty civil.  Did they bust them in like you were talking about?  No, no, they didn't.  But a couple of kids were little hooligans. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Little hooligans.  They were three kids that just kept coming back to the door in different masks and costumes.  Yeah, but that's flattering.  That means you had some good shit.  Oh, I had the bestest shit.  What was your shit?  Well, I had Choco, which is good.  Look, what am I, from Inglewood?  Pulp Fiction.  Oh, okay.  It scared me.  No, it was, they kept coming back, but then I didn't realize until like the third time.  And I was like, hey, what are you doing? 
[00:21:00]  And I would just put the tray down and let them grab from themselves.  And that was it.  It wasn't just quality.  I'd give the kids quantity.  But then I had to hold the thing up and like dole out one.  And when a kid starts jumping at it, I picked up a Snickers bar and I threw it at his head.  Nice.  As he was walking down the sidewalk.  And then you get these poor little kids you feel bad for because they're like, you know,  they take one and they're like, thank you.  Right.  All pensive.  And then I was pissed because I don't want to be part of a kid's fucking etiquette lesson. 
[00:21:30]  When you sit there, I give out the candy and then the parents are like, what do you say?  And they're like, chicken cheat.  It's like, no, no.  What do you say now?  And I got to stand there like waiting for this kid to cough up.  Thank you.  Fuck the thank you.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  We know what this is about.  The door.  Wham.  It's a stupid holiday.  Take your candy and beat it.  It's a shakedown.  Yes.  It's a shakedown.  And why would you walk around aimlessly from neighborhood to neighborhood when you could  do circles and get all your candy?  Why?  That's true.  What?  Is every house special?  No. 
[00:22:00]  It's the same shit.  It's the same shit.  Same shit.  Although in my neighborhood, I know mine was the best.  Well, if they're coming back, it has to be.  I was looking in the little bags and things and seeing what was in there.  And, you know, I had your quality items, your Snickers, your Twix.  King size.  Well, no, they were fun size, but they were taking fistfuls.  What's a fun size?  Isn't candy in general fun?  It's hilarious.  Why does it have to be a fun size?  Fun.  Giddy.  Stupid marketing words.  Giddy size.  Yeah.  But, you know, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Kurt Love.  Wow.  Ant went all out.  All right.  You're sarcastic.  Fuck one.  Yeah.  Fun size.  I think the average fucking plumber is getting fun size.  I know.  You should have went king size.  No, but you know what?  There was some.  I looked in there, and there was some of those fucking dumb ass candy corn.  What do you mean?  If you give out candy corn, you should be fucking just assassinated.  It's horrible.  And it's just by itself.  I mean, it's not.  Yeah, in the bag, just laying there on the bottom like lint.  It's not in packaging or anything.  It's terrible.  What's candy corn? 
[00:23:00]  It's wax.  Yeah, but no, I was giving out good shit.  And then packs of M&M's.  And, yeah, just good quality items.  A lot of people used my trick, and it worked perfectly.  What was that?  Oh, the empty bowl.  The empty bowl with the sign.  The empty bowl.  You know.  Yeah.  Take one.  Take one, and then they realize, oh, see?  He tried.  He put in the effort.  But apparently he had good stuff, and now it's all out.  How was your building, Jimmy?  They take over the building?  Oh, boy.  Well, I was supposed to have no kids at my door, because I'm not on that list. 
[00:23:30]  For trick-or-treat, anyway.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that your excuse?  Yeah.  Yeah, I went over yesterday.  Were you allowed to?  Well, you know.  Were you allowed to be on the list?  Yeah.  You know, there's a whole 500-foot thing.  They said to stand in the hallway, I can just lob the candy.  They're fucking bags like a free throw.  But I said, you know, I didn't want anybody, but they kept knocking on the door, and it  was a hassle.  And I went over my massage scenario yesterday, where I really was getting a massage.  Really?  It was a legit one, but still annoying. 
[00:24:00]  Try to talk somebody into something.  Fucking ding-dong.  It's like, come on.  Yeah.  You're trying to negotiate, and a little kid's in a Halloween costume.  She wasn't interested in negotiating.  I knew from the beginning she wasn't, but I'm like, still, you try.  You open the cheeks a little bit.  Is it humiliating when they don't go for the signs?  No, because...  Or the moves?  The signs.  What, like a third base fucking...  Yeah.  Oh, he's opening up his ass cheeks.  Oh, he's waving me in.  Yeah, I thought you said curveball.  He's like, no, that means quit waving your dick at me. 
[00:24:30]  I would imagine it would be humiliating if they don't go for it, if you're putting yourself  in these positions.  Depends on how you say it.  This girl I didn't really try with, because I knew she was...  You could tell she was legit, because she was too strong to be...  Do you enjoy a massage if it's legit?  Oh, yeah.  I call only legit masseuses.  And the ones I see don't typically do anything, and I know that.  Right.  But I've had a few that have, but because this one side has gotten dirtier, like the legit  masseuses are all kind of being more legit, if that makes any sense. 
[00:25:00]  Like, they know what it looks like out there.  Right.  So they're almost, they're like overly draping.  It's getting like annoying, actually.  Overly draping?  You have to be draped.  Yeah, yeah.  There's one massage, one I saw recently, and she's like, I don't mind being draped, because  you have to be.  But she tucked me, like, it was like a mummy wrap.  It was like, I get it.  I'm not going to put my dick by you.  Relax.  Oh, God.  Like, when they lift the one leg and jam the fucking sheet under the other, it's like.  Like, they don't want your dick creeping out?  It's like, I understand the massage language. 
[00:25:30]  Like, when you're draping me, I understand you have to do that by law, but you don't  have to lift the leg and cram it under.  I understand.  I understand.  You don't want a sexual thing.  I accept that.  Oh, look that way.  Cram it under there.  Get under there.  Foot, foot, foot.  Foot, foot, foot, foot, foot.  They tuck it in so your dick won't accidentally slither out.  Like an Indian woman.  It's like, madam.  That's uncomfortable if you're having a massage.  You can't move around.  That I don't like.  I feel bad for the girls out there that go to massage school hoping to get into a legit 
[00:26:00]  business.  And then you got these pervs all over the place trying to get a little extra all the time.  Just a little brush.  A little brush of the hand or something.  They just happen to be pretty.  They just happen to have big tits.  It's like, God bless them and curse them at the same time.  But no, the one.  They probably should only allow the ugly ones into massage school.  I agree.  Really?  Yes.  Because I don't want them.  But this is the one.  You could tell where they're no nonsense.  Like this.  This girl was no nonsense.  And I knew it.  Right. 
[00:26:30]  So I did the leg separation, but it just got nothing.  Oh, really?  But it wasn't embarrassing because it was just, you know, it wasn't like I.  But then on top of me.  I tried to lay down doing a split.  A little bit.  Like, yeah.  I look like a fucking T-square.  Legs are completely out.  You who?  But then on top of that, they come to your place.  Yeah.  So they must be like, fuck, man.  I just wanted to go into this cool business.  Maybe work in a mountain resort.  And I'm in some dummy's apartment.  Yeah, this creep pushing his asshole up with this fucking Ozzy Osbourne staring at me from 
[00:27:00]  the wall.  But I haven't had a dirty one in quite a while.  Yeah, man.  I'm in a real dry spell, which is kind of frustrating.  What?  It's like fishing?  You enjoy the sport of it?  Yeah.  And then there's other times, though, where I like, though, it's almost when you know  100% that it's legit.  It takes a certain pressure off you.  Right.  Because I'm such a pervert, I almost feel obligated.  Right.  But with certain ones, like I go to this one person and get them.  Yeah.  I know that they just, they're all no-nonsense and she may, I know the whole fucking drill.  So it kind of removes a weird pressure to do anything. 
[00:27:30]  You guys talked about this yesterday?  Yeah.  Well, I covered it.  Because Spectro is beating me up because I didn't listen to the replay.  Go fuck yourself.  When you have a day off, you have a day off.  Whatever job you have, if you have a day off, do you go somewhere else and do it?  Or watch someone else do it?  This is a job.  Well, what I'm talking about right now, I covered it yesterday, but not to the extent  I'm covering it now.  And I'm talking more about the legit ones.  But, I mean, if we get a day off, I'm not. 
[00:28:00]  I don't listen to replays.  You want to take a break from the whole fucking thing.  Even though this is a cool job.  Yeah, I don't understand that part of it, but, you know.  Yeah.  Why listen?  Will I listen to the Ace Freely replay?  You fucking bet.  Oh, yeah, you will.  Ah, Ace Freely.  He's in today.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I told the story on the after show.  I couldn't leave during the Tony Iommi interview because I was scared you were going to scold 
[00:28:30]  me.  No, not at all, dude.  You said you might have to because you had to be somewhere.  I was going to Philly.  Yeah, I wouldn't.  Whatever.  Like I said, Iommi, it's...  I mean, it's half true.  I mean, the other thing is that it turned out to be a great interview and I was loving his  stories.  Yeah.  But I'm sitting there.  Everyone else saw it.  I'm piling up my stuff because I want to sneak out early.  And I'm like, man, if I don't do this properly, I could get yelled at by Jimmy.  No, no.  I understood.  It's like, if you've got to be somebody, you'll be sorry.  It was...  As long as you didn't take him with you.  As long as you didn't walk out and go, Tony.  Let's go. 
[00:29:00]  Wait, wait.  Let's go.  He sold...  Kenny was at Bookends in Ridgewood.  He sold fucking over 700 books.  Holy shit.  At that location alone.  In two hours.  Wow.  That is an amazing fucking book signing.  Wow, wow, wow.  700 fucking books in two hours.  Wow.  I loved seeing the crowd there.  Just fucking guys with long hair and ripped up t-shirts.  Yeah, rock.  Still living the dream.  Yep.  Nothing wrong with that.  I asked somebody to find out what cologne he wore because he smelled so good. 
[00:29:30]  Enough with asking the rock stars what cologne they wore.  Why do they smell good?  Duff smelled great.  Fucking...  I'll tell you who smelled.  Ozzy smelled.  Well, I know what Ozzy wears.  And fucking...  And I haven't...  Can't come.  It just doesn't smell as good on me.  And Rob Halford smells great.  Oh, wow.  I love that.  Rock stars.  These guys smell...  Well, you know.  That might be the scent of the...  Oh, well, you know.  To bring him in, you know.  Oh, the Lord of the Young Wins in.  Lord of the Men.  There might be a special thing in there.  You don't know.  And what's his name? 
[00:30:00]  And fucking I don't know how he smelled.  They just smelled...  There's a smell these guys have.  I don't know how they keep...  I can't smell my own cologne when I put it on.  Like, give me a spray cologne.  I know.  What's that about?  I don't...  Am I just used to it?  You can smell it?  I don't know.  I think leather helps, too.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think when you're wearing some kind of leather and then some cologne, that leather  mixes in with it.  Leather naturally just smells kind of cool.  Just put it on the leather collar?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The leather smells good.  Long hair, too.  I wonder if they...  I wonder if Ozzy sprayed his hair with a cologne.  Hair products.  Because he smells...  He smells...  Hair products. 
[00:30:30]  He's in the studio, and Ozzy walked by, and he's like, is Ozzy around?  He smelled him from the hallway.  He's dreaming.  He knows the smell.  It's such a...  Yeah.  Sorry, you're very good.  Archipi, San Francisco.  Oh!  The fuck is happening with the hockey thing up top?  That's why you should watch, man.  Oh, man, did he blindside him.  Well, you don't hug the other guy.  That was hilarious.  You kind of made a mistake there.  He just...  He hugs him.  You don't do that.  But why did he punch him?  I don't know.  Did he punch him or hit him in the... 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, he punched him.  He belted him in the face!  He gave him a punch that wasn't going to get him in too much trouble.  Why would you tell the guy laughing after he punched him?  He didn't say...  Because they're hockey players.  They're meatheads.  I always saw...  He takes a punch to the face and just laughs it off.  Who's got the story?  Because I saw it very briefly on Twitter on the way in today.  Did the guy score, and he was celebrating by hugging the other guy?  Oh, maybe.  I just saw the clip.  I think that's what happened.  Yeah.  That could piss him off.  I think he scored, and then he got excited and hugged the player from the other team. 
[00:31:30]  And then that guy said, fuck you, and gave him a nice jab to the face.  I believe that's the story.  I saw the Occupy San Francisco now.  Oh, you did?  No, I mean on the tube.  Oh, yeah.  It's in every fucking city.  Yeah, I know.  How does it end?  How does it end?  But you were saying, though, that you saw the Philly one.  Yeah, I was down in Philly.  I had some...  And there's a big drop-off.  I had some business.  So I stopped by Occupy Philly, thinking, ah, maybe film, maybe just check it out, whatever. 
[00:32:00]  Someone has to call and explain this to me, because what I saw...  And people get mad when I say, this is what I saw.  But it's what I saw.  Oh, you're having a fucking agenda.  You're the 1%.  Yeah, you know what?  I am the 1%.  Yeah.  You know, I was the 99...  I was the 99% for most of my fucking life.  Exactly.  And now I am the 1%.  And all right, I'm embarrassed to be the 1%.  I'm sorry.  But that's not why I'm going down and shooting shit.  I'm shooting shit, because there's freaks down there, and I love that type of thing.  But for some reason, I guess I have an agenda. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  But this is what I saw in Philadelphia.  It is extremely ghetto, and a ton of drug addicts.  Like the cracky kind.  Like the...  Oh, shit.  Like the...  I don't know.  Like, they're a bit older.  Dangerous looking?  Real dangerous.  Yeah.  And they opened up, like, what could only be described as the soup kitchen, and they  lined up like zombies.  Zombies.  They were a wreck down there.  That's fucked up, man.  I think Philly's got all the homeless that are just hanging out. 
[00:33:00]  And it's City Hall.  How are they covering it like it's some kind of fucking event, when it pretty much is just  the homeless?  Especially in somewhere like Philly.  Like, you saw it firsthand.  Well, I've been down to Zuccotti Park a lot, as most know.  And this was my first trip to the Philly one.  And I'm telling you, there was a major drop-off in the quality of people.  And that's not saying much.  And a lot of the people at Zuccotti Park are questionable.  Yeah.  They really are.  But this Philly was just a whole bunch of...  Dirtbags?  Well, it was ghetto. 
[00:33:30]  Ghetto?  Yeah.  You're not seeing a lot of black people at Zuccotti Park, but man, there were way more  black people in Occupy Philly.  And are they there for the cause, or are they there for the free food and shelter and fucking  clothes?  This is what I need to know.  They had way more tents down there, too.  And they take up way more of an area down there than Zuccotti Park here in New York City.  There were hundreds of tents, and there weren't a lot of people around.  The people I saw were, like I said, black and kind of like druggie, drug addict type 
[00:34:00]  people just wandering like zombies.  That's all I saw.  But what happens with these Occupy, put your city here, is they do day trips.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To go do something.  So were they doing that yesterday when I was there?  To be fair, because this is what I saw yesterday, but if someone knows differently, please tell me.  Were they on a mission?  Yeah, because I'm seeing a lot of white people in this video that Sam is showing me.  I absolutely didn't see any of this.  It's Occupy Philly.  That guy looks like he could be a normal guy.  Did not see this at all.  I did not see the normal white woman we're looking at. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, God.  I hate these fucking idiots.  You hate?  Why?  I hate them.  I don't hate it at all.  I hate them.  I think it's kind of cool in a weird way.  Fucking assholes.  Bank of America backed off on that scumbag $5 debit charge.  Yeah.  That they were going to try to put...  But you know what?  It wasn't these fucking assholes that got that done.  It was the people that bank with Bank of America that said, fuck you.  That sucks.  I'm going to take my money out.  These people don't even have fucking bank accounts for the most part.  And then they're crying that it's going to cost the banking industry a billion dollars or something. 
[00:35:00]  A billion on top of the billions they already make, I guess.  I know.  Like it's all relative.  How is it going to cost them a billion?  Well, they would get five bucks from everybody.  All the billions they can't make.  Fuck them.  They're going to lose a billion dollars off that.  They would have gotten a fuckload of money.  Right.  I pulled a lot of my money out of Bank of America and put it with other investments in places.  But I yanked most of my money out of there because I just...  Be careful what bank you pick, man.  Some of these other banks might give you a better deal. 
[00:35:30]  But fuck, who knows if they're stable.  It's all right.  FDIC.  That's what I'm talking about here, Jerry.  Why don't you see old Bill Deal on a Northwest Federal?  I put it in Ted's high interest yield bank.  I'm sure you did.  We pay 37%, Gregory.  Imagine that.  You would never sleep just wondering when your bank's going to collapse.  Hey, Harry, carry it in my pocket.  I pay 37%.  It's a Putin's scheme. 
[00:36:00]  Heck, I'd give you a one point over prime?  Now, to be fair, what we're seeing here is one video from Occupy Philly.  And this is completely different than what I saw.  So maybe they had some kind of day thing going.  Or maybe because it's a Tuesday.  Maybe they were still in their tents.  I don't know.  I wasn't going to knock on tents to see what the fuck was going on.  And this is from earlier.  It's from like October 7th.  So maybe it's...  When did socialism become a dirty word?  That's someone's sign.  It's not what our fucking country's based on, you cock. 
[00:36:30]  I don't think anybody hates socialism.  It's just when you see policies here that are making capitalism into socialism,  that's when it becomes a dirty word.  Not in itself.  Jesus.  It just doesn't work as a system.  Yeah, it has had trouble, right?  Oh, yeah.  Historically, it just doesn't...  It doesn't really make people want to invent new things.  It doesn't promote entrepreneurism.  Yeah.  It just makes people want to fucking get on the dole and not really go above and beyond 
[00:37:00]  to make something of themselves.  When everybody sees the ceiling, it seems like it's harder to...  That's where capitalism is great.  It's like you don't see the ceiling.  No ambition to be better, to make something that no one else has made, to have an idea  no one else has had, and then putting it forward and making a success of yourself because of  that, when you just know that you're not going to be able to enjoy the fruits of your 
[00:37:30]  labor, and it's just going to be divvied up amongst the community.  It's ridiculous.  Is this yesterday?  Fuck you.  Go to Russia.  Oh, they're not coming.  There you go, Ant.  This is what I saw yesterday.  Really?  Okay.  I see some Hispanics.  I see some Asians.  I see some blacks.  Is there a lot of people down there?  No.  Ideal wall.  But a ton of tents, so there's obviously a lot of people occupying.  I don't know if they were in the tents, like I said, or doing some kind of day trip. 
[00:38:00]  Homeless, yeah.  But when they opened up that soup kitchen, man, they came out of nowhere and lined up for  free food, and the people on the line were really fucking scary.  Really fucking scary.  But now these protesters, they come down there with this idea, but now they have a problem  because they are then put, it really is a genius thing of allowing you to, they are  now put in the position of, in a smaller scale, who they're accusing everybody else of being  in, which is, do you really want all these homeless guys just coming and taking your shit  when you're here for a purpose?  Right. 
[00:38:30]  They have to give it to them, but it's using their resources, and they're not doing anything  to earn it.  Oh, well.  Isn't that a bitch?  And the homeless know how to survive on the streets, obviously.  So if they see something like this where they're going to, like, they're putting out food every  day, trust me, the word gets out, and everyone's like, yeah, it's a watering hole.  That's right.  Wait, this is like me being in my living room, and all of a sudden, chicks with giant tits  and big pussies are all over the place, and they need a place to tinkle.  Oh, Jimmy's face weak.  And then there's other accusations that the cops now in some of these cities, including 
[00:39:00]  New York, are pushing, like, the drunks.  I could totally see that.  And some of the scourge, like, they're just kind of pushing them towards Zuccotti Park  in New York City.  I could see that.  Why wouldn't they?  It's brilliant.  It's been said.  You know, who knows?  Who knows what's true out there?  But, yeah, that's what I saw in Philly.  It was a much different fucking scene.  What's going on with Michael Moore?  He's ignoring questions or something you were telling me?  Of course.  You know, who hasn't figured this idiot out already? 
[00:39:30]  They revere him at these fucking Occupy events.  He's been trotting about the country, going to these various cities where they have these  Occupy things, and he's a hero.  He's a hero.  He speaks, and they just look at him like he's Christ, like he's fat Jesus.  Well, this is in his wheelhouse, let's be honest.  Of course.  It's exactly his demo to sell his fucking books.  And he beats the shit out of this so-called 1% when he goes down there and asks them to 
[00:40:00]  give.  And at one point he asks them, hey, why don't they cough up a million dollars each, these  motherfuckers?  And some guy said, hey, Michael, you're one.  You're one of the 1%.  And boy, did he ignore that motherfucker.  And then these freedom of speech men, freedom of speech people just start trying to drown  out the guy that was asking him, hey, Michael, you know, what the fuck?  So, yeah, there's audio of that.  I mean, what is he doing?  It's not a weird spot.  It's an exact spot he wants to be in. 
[00:40:30]  He's selling books.  He's a multimillionaire.  But I mean, is he donating money?  Is he helping the cause financially?  What is he doing?  Why don't people like him and like Jon Stewart, who I watched last night on The Daily Show,  just lambasting the so-called 1% who he is an entrenched member of.  If you want to give more money, give it.  Fucking fork it over.  You're allowed.  You're allowed to give as much money to the IRS as you damn well please.  You don't have to give just what they tell you. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  So give an extra million bucks.  That'll help somewhere down the line.  Me personally, I don't feel like giving anymore.  I feel I'm doing my share.  That's my opinion on what's going on.  And legally, I'm doing everything I can, but I don't want to give more.  If they want to preach that this bastard 1% isn't doing enough, you're part of it.  Give.  Give until it hurts, fat man.  How about giving away half your wealth?  You're right.  I mean, because they're in a place where half their wealth, they would still be very, very comfortable. 
[00:41:30]  Yep.  How about that?  I mean, if you're that for the cause, how about saying no more fucking private planes, no more first class?  Any money I would go in first class, I'll fly and coach and give the rest to the government.  There you go.  Feel free.  It is strange when these celebrities show up.  It's like, I'm here to support you.  And they all look at him like they did it to Russell Simmons too.  Like, what?  You know how rich you are?  But Michael Moore, they just, they revere him because he comes across like, hey, I'm 
[00:42:00]  just the ordinary guy from Flint, Michigan.  Look out.  Oh, I'm against the fucking system.  He is the fucking system.  You think he's on private jets when he goes from one occupy to the next?  And the guy brings it up.  The guy that was, uh, yeah, let's, let's hear the clip.  Because first of all, he can't fly fucking coach.  That fat fuck could not squeak himself into a coach seat.  Yeah, but he can afford the two seats.  Well, that's true.  And first, what he just said was that the richest 400, we know about them, right? 
[00:42:30]  They have more wealth than 150 million Americans combined.  All right?  400 people.  I think, I think what he's trying to do is say, look, my level's not the problem. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So that's what a lot of these guys do.  My level's fine.  This should be a fine level.  We're talking about the people above me.  You know what?  They're not talking about that.  But that's how they, that's how.  Trying to justify it?  Well, that's how some of these guys are trying to justify it.  I'm sure that's how Jon Stewart justifies it.  It's like, no, this level's fine.  This isn't, this isn't greedy right here.  Yeah, please.  We're talking about the people above me.  Well, everyone standing there isn't.  Because he's, he's firmly one of the 1%.  No, no, but that's, but that's what he's saying. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, that's what he's saying.  Yes.  Yeah, but even the people that are protesting aren't saying that.  Oh, I understand, but he's already saying that with his little speech here, because  he knows that.  He knows what's coming.  He knows there's eyes on him going, what the fuck, Michael?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're kind of that 1% they're, you know, talking about here.  He's exactly the 1%.  Why does he just, why does he point out the fact, though, that like, and I agree with  Michael Moore on this point, like him, Jon Stewart, these guys earn their money through  doing what they do, but they're not, they're not fucking asking the government to, I guess, 
[00:44:00]  pay things out and then taking giant pay, like, they're not doing the things that the  bankers, no, no, I know.  I'm talking about the bankers, not you, I'm talking about the bankers.  Oh, I know.  The ones who I have a problem with are not these guys.  They're not guys who make a lot of money.  I don't care if you make a billion dollars.  I don't have a problem with fucking guys who make 50 million a year.  It's only the ones who make it a certain way.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  But do you understand these people in these parks don't look at it like that?  They're looking at people that just have carved out a nice living for themselves as being 
[00:44:30]  evil, and anyone with more money than they have is bad, and that should be divvied up  in some way, shape, or form through higher taxes and whatnot.  And believe me, you're just as evil to them, Jimmy, as the fucking bankers.  I hope so.  You're just as bad.  Oh, absolutely.  Hey, you want to hear about the shit monster?  What?  And remember, I said that supposedly they're sending some of the dregs down to these places?  Oh, right, right, right.  Finley from Manhattan.  Finley.  Finley.  Amen.  Hey.  Yeah, I'm a fireman on the Lower East Side. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  And I'll just say, we sent the shit monster.  You guys know about him.  I sent him in for the homeless shopping spree.  Shit monster.  Yeah, we could have had the shit monster for the homeless shopping spree.  We never had the shit monster for the homeless shopping spree, right?  No, you didn't, because the lawyers.  Shut it.  Yeah, they shut it down, whatever.  But this is a homeless guy known as the shit monster, and Finley personally sent him to  Zuccotti Park to hang out.  What does he do?  What does he do?  He shits a lot.  He shits himself?  But let me just get, as soon as you touch him and try and take him to the hospital, 
[00:45:30]  as like a defense mechanism, like a skunk, he shits a lot.  Oh, that's right.  He shits himself.  That's right.  I forgot about that part.  Yeah.  So then you don't want to touch him.  You don't want to do it.  But I didn't send him down there because I want to fuck with him.  Well, maybe a little bit.  Mostly because I don't want to deal with him.  Yeah.  He knows, hey, I go down there.  I get free food, lodging.  People hand me out stuff.  And he went.  And I haven't seen him since.  Now, did somebody tell him that, and he actually listened without shitting? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  This is after he had shit himself.  And I finally said, hey, fucko, listen.  Don't you know what's going on downtown?  They're giving out food.  They're giving out shelter.  They're giving out water.  Go down there.  You can hang out.  You can do whatever you want.  Fucking the shit monster.  Wow.  How many times does he must just stink?  That's great that he's got a name.  He leaves puddles, puddles of shit on the ship.  What the fuck is he eating?  It's a great defense mechanism.  He doesn't.  He just drinks.  All he does is drink.  Oh, he's got fucking alcohol shit. 
[00:46:30]  They're not healthy?  Wow.  That's a good one.  There you go.  The shit monster might be at Zuccotti Park.  Thanks to Finley.  Hey, go Sam.  Celebrity.  And really fast, Brian to Philly.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey.  Good morning, Opie.  Anthony.  Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, how you doing?  Philly has a hardcore homeless population.  They're basically professional homeless, insane people.  They just will refuse any kind of help, shelter, assistance, or anything.  They live in tents outside all year round, either by the library or the art museum or under 
[00:47:00]  the Vine Street Expressway or whatever.  And they also, whenever anyone is giving out anything for free, they just know.  They kind of gravitate towards it like ants to a picnic.  I used to be homeless myself in like 2006, but I went through the shelter system.  And there's a few people that kind of are there legitimately because they made bad decisions  or lost their jobs or whatever.  But most of them are just, they're just insane. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, filthy fucking bums.  Well, and they know where the free food is, so it's not really helping the cause because  you've got a lot of people going down there that they don't want to join the cause.  They just want the free eats.  Yeah, absolutely.  When I was in the shelter, like, people would come back at the end of the day or whatever  and everyone would exchange information on, like, who's giving out the showers, who's  giving out the clothes, who's giving out the food.  And they just know.  And that's really all they're there.  Yeah, I think we were saying that the other day.  There's a whole network with the homeless, and the word gets out where, like you said, 
[00:48:00]  where the stuff they need is happening that day.  And right now, man, it's a goldmine.  Every day, you're guaranteed to get a free meal if you go to one of these Occupies.  So, thanks, Brian.  No problem.  Have a good one.  All right, back to the Michael Moore clip.  And this man, Thomas, is requesting, and I think it's a very simple request, would each  of these 400 just give back a million dollars each? 
[00:48:30]  How about a million of your 50 million?  How about a million of your 50 million?  Supposedly he's worth 50 million dollars.  That's not even beyond the realm of possibility, of course.  So why doesn't he start this?  That would be a great story.  A great start.  Michael, you start this.  You start.  Go ahead.  And show how easy it is to do, because if you're worth 50 million, that's an easy thing  to do.  Yep.  Yep.  That's right. 
[00:49:00]  But I don't like the fact that he's not differentiating the top 400.  It's like, I'm jealous that they have a lot more than me, but there are people that are  extraordinarily wealthy that really did earn it, and not on the backs of scumbag moves with  the government.  They're people who have legitimately just fucking invested and made their money.  Michael Moore would be giving up about 2% of his wealth, I guess, right?  If he did that?  A lousy 2%.  So fucking...  Hey, what about it?  So start this, Michael.  Come on.  And see what other celebrities would join in.  I love that somebody fucking started yelling that out. 
[00:49:30]  Love it.  Yeah.  Call him out.  50 million.  I'm a million of your 50 million.  They spend that on lunch.  And he's walking away.  Is he?  Yeah.  But listen, I know they...  He wasn't expecting that.  Thank you so much for all you've done.  Thank you.  I love Portland.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's...  He starts walking away.  That's annoying.  He should have addressed that.  Why didn't he address that? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  Why didn't he address it?  He didn't address that.  No?  No.  All right.  Please make way for him up these stairs.  Michael.  Michael.  How much of your own 50 million are you going to donate to Occupy BDX?  You don't want to answer that?  Aren't you part of the 1%?  Aren't you part of the 1%? 
[00:50:30]  You should at least answer the guy.  No.  That's terrible.  That looks terrible.  He should have had an answer for that.  Hypocrite.  Who is the 1%?  Selling books.  Where does the 1% start?  1% starts at anyone making more money than these fucking assholes.  Believe me.  But is there a number?  I don't know.  Of how much you're worth?  That you're part of the 1%?  It's the 1% of the country that...  Is Michael Moore the 1%?  Oh, God.  If you're making 50 million, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Yes.  Sure.  Yes.  I think so.  Or you'd be considered by them the 1%?  And 1% is a figurative thing now.  It's not technically the 1% anymore.  It's become this thing that's a dirty word for anybody that has made money and has more  than the average person in this country.  They consider them the 1%.  Blow me.  He really should have had an answer.  He should have assumed that maybe someone would get to him and ask him some tough questions, 
[00:51:30]  man.  I mean, you're going into that territory.  Holy shit.  You better be prepared.  Yeah.  They're all over the place down there.  But he knows it's a fucking...  It's his own crowd.  You might get one or two people that'll blurt shit out like that, but then the crowd starts  turning.  One guy is all it takes.  And yelling.  One guy is all it takes.  Now there's clips everywhere.  That's true.  And now he looks kind of stupid.  He looks really stupid because he's not specifically saying they should go after the people that  fucking took money from the government, took our money, and then took these giant payouts. 
[00:52:00]  Those people should have the payouts taken back by force, and they should just be fucking  smashed in the street.  Like, those people should violently have the money taken back from them.  But not just because you earn money.  Those guys are like the half of the 1%.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  You know what I mean?  That number is a lot lower than 1%.  Is that true?  What?  The 1%.  In 2009, it took just $343,927 to join that elite group. 
[00:52:30]  What, making that a year?  Yeah, it says the average made $960,000 a year.  I think that's annual income, yeah.  Annual income.  $345,000, let's say.  And you are part of the scumbag, 1% elite, not doing anything, percent.  Fuck you.  So, Michael Moore is absolutely part of the 1%.  Yeah.  Weight-wise he is, too.  So, Michael Moore, you should be giving up your million if that's what you want the 1%ers to do. 
[00:53:00]  Can you imagine the amount of press he would get if he did that?  If he took the million dollars of his money and said, but he wouldn't because he's just going to give it to the dumb government?  Yeah.  These dummies?  He knows that.  But if he did that.  And he should do that, Jimmy.  Absolutely.  You know why?  Because I think Aaron was mentioning, this is good for his business.  He'll make that money and more.  Absolutely.  Because I'm sure he's filming.  I'm sure something will come out.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me, he's going to document this shit.  Whether it's a book, a TV show, a movie, he's going to make a lot of money off the Occupy movement. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  He absolutely will.  Yeah, why not just cover costs on the next documentary and take no money from it?  Right.  Pay your costs and then take no money.  Give the million away.  That would be a great start to your movie.  And then go around with your dumb fucking camera talking to other celebrities, seeing  if they're going to give up their million.  That's great.  And then you can take your stupid bullhorn and yell at buildings again.  Douchebag.  That's when he lost me.  Really?  You're yelling at buildings through a bullhorn?  Yeah.  I understand how it's symbolic, but, you know, that's not too brave. 
[00:54:00]  He did something else, too, that was really weird with the...  I kind of like his movies in general.  I really do, but...  Taken as entertainment.  But then he gets kind of douchey.  Not as his...  What was it?  The Cuba one where you might have saw another boat 10 miles away that he was yelling at?  I think that might have been one of them.  Yeah.  Cuba.  He was getting close to, you know, Cuban waters or something.  Yep.  Help me out.  I think...  Was that it?  Yeah.  Was that in...  Sicko?  I think that was the Sicko, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Sicko.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, trying to take the guy for health.  But he was yelling at the boat like they could possibly hear him, but it was obviously for  his film.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, taking him for health care.  Right.  Stupid.  It's Cuba Gooding Jr. or something, you know.  Woo.  Make way for the 1%.  $50 million Michael Moore.  Here he comes.  Thank you, Michael Moore.  Michael, we love you. 
[00:55:00]  Make way for the 1%.  Hey, Michael, you flying the corporate jet back?  Huh?  Your own private jet?  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  I'm trying to get a chant going.  Yeah.  Instigator.  I know.  Who's paying you?  I'm the char.  Instigator.  Who's paying you?  Who's paying you?  So much for free speech.  Exactly.  So much for free speech, right?  Who's paying you?  So much for free speech.  At least they weren't yelling pervert at him.  Yeah.  Because that'll make you move, man. 
[00:55:30]  But the guy...  That's what they do.  That's their tactics.  What a prime example.  Yeah.  Of what hypocritical douche fucks they are.  This guy's got his fucking shit to say.  And they just try to drown him out because your hero, Michael Moore, is using you to sell books.  You should be listening to all voices.  Yeah.  Those people should be all about that, right?  And the guy wasn't saying anything that isn't true.  And they should be questioning Michael Moore.  They know he's worth...  I mean, some say $50 million.  Most of the people down there know he's very well off. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, but he's just one of them at heart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  Yeah, that really is annoying.  Gonna take the corporate jet.  Extremely.  It's great.  And if Michael Moore were to turn around and say,  I've never flown a corporate jet in my life...  Maybe that's not true, though.  No, no.  But if he had an answer...  Yeah.  Or something like that, but he just...  You can't just walk away from that stuff.  Try to shut him down, but no.  Couldn't.  Nope.  Could.  So.  Heat that.  Rare.  Man, I don't know how this ends.  I mean, I said the other day, I think a murder will end it. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I think a murder in Zuccotti Park's gonna end the whole thing.  A freezing death of somebody that isn't just, you know, some homeless...  And people are getting more and more uptight down there as the days go by and the weather  gets colder, so...  I think that's how it ends.  But this thing is in every city now, man.  Yeah.  How the fuck you end this?  I don't know.  I think you're right, though.  A death.  Some type of tragedy. 
[00:57:00]  Open your fucking eyes, people!  Open your fucking eyes!  That's all we're asking you to do!  Open your fucking eyes!  We're marching to the beach, while I kick by Wall Street.  Oh, shoehorn.  We're getting a shot, we're left out, we're turning up our heels.  Why are we here?  What are we gonna do?  Why are we here?  I don't know.  Maybe it's to help people out.  Maybe it's to help out your fellow man.  Maybe it's to help out a woman across the fucking street.  What? 
[00:57:30]  What an idiot.  What a fucking idiot.  Just fucking maybe, it's about feeding your fucking family.  It's about putting food on the fucking table.  How many more clinchés is this guy going to do?  See, I can't do that.  They got fucking unemployment through the fucking roof in this country.  Yeah, because they keep extending the benefits.  Get a fucking job, they say.  Who would get a fucking job?  Sometimes it's not fucking that easy.  That's right.  I bet you.  That guy's good.  Unemployment is so lucrative to these people these days.  Yeah.  And the way they're extending the benefits, that... 
[00:58:00]  I bet that's a large part of why they can't figure out how to lower the unemployment rate.  Right.  Because what's the ambition to go to work when you're pretty much going to make exactly what  you're making on unemployment?  Really.  Think about it.  Think about it.  We're watching my fifth video from Occupy Wall Street.  This is an Aussie. 
[00:58:30]  Aussie.  How do you say it?  Yeah, Aussie.  Aussie.  Aussie?  Aussie, yeah.  Aussie.  Aussie or Aussie.  But then it's Aussie, Aussie.  No, if you say Aussie, then I'll just get excited.  Oh, okay.  That's how they say it in California, I bet.  Yay.  See, and this is why I get really mad, because people think I have an agenda, when it's so  easy just to film shit down there.  You got a guy.  How do you describe the guy that's being interviewed?  Looks like Danny.  Oh, he's got on the bike, though.  He's a fucking shithead.  He's in a bag.  What is he dressed in?  I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  But he's trying to make the point that this guy, Peter Pedals, I think, you might have  to back up slightly, you know, would pedal his bike to get energy.  And it's all well and good, because as this guy's being interviewed, there's a guy in the  background doing just that.  He's pedaling.  Pedaling.  Pedal generators.  But the problem is, in this particular clip that people think I set up, obviously, because  I have an agenda, the kid who's pedaling has a Starbucks in one hand, and he's on his  cell phone in the other.  This is what is fucking up your movement. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  I would really like to sit down with some of these Occupy Wall Street people and go,  do you understand what's going on here?  You can't have a guy trying to talk about alternative energy by pedaling a bike, saying, look what  we're doing by pedaling, because supposedly they are actually creating energy down there  for something.  Yeah, he's got like a generator.  But you can't have the guy drinking a Starbucks and taking a cell phone call.  He's on the cell phone, sure.  How about you make your own coffee?  How about you use that to power your own little coffee pot, and you make your own Sanka? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, it's not as good.  Did you back up so you could hear about Peter Pedals?  Peter Pedals.  You want to hear about Peter Pedals?  Hit it.  Peter Pedals was doing just this.  He was producing energy, grinding his food, using the bike as a tool, the pedal power as  a tool, to drive, to do all kinds of things.  The inventions have greatly influenced a lot of ideas. 
[01:00:30]  Now I'm burning nine out.  And he's got the coffee and the cell phone.  He's like, yeah.  Don't get mad at me in the comments of the YouTube videos.  Don't get mad at me.  This is what's going on down there.  It's easy to find.  Brilliant.  I have enough material for probably 10 more videos.  Wouldn't you think you'd reuse the same cup over and over?  I mean, why not?  If you're Peter Pedals.  Peter Pedals. 
[01:01:00]  Peter Puffer.  Petal file.  If you're Peter Pedals, the son of Rose, why wouldn't you make your own coffee and reuse  the same cup and use soy milk?  Um, yeah, this, all this, uh, this video is from a mere two days ago.  There were a lot of fine musicians down there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Including this guy talking about, singing about his boss.  You want to back up?  Take this job and shiver.  Yeah, the tent next door to me was so... 
[01:01:30]  That's good.  He's got a nice little ditty.  Now I'm working nine hours every day upon my feet.  My boss, he lives way down on easy street.  I make him a dollar.  He pays me just a dime.  And if I start to holler, he says it's a bloody crime.  Oh, shut up.  That guy's good.  That dumb song.  Oh, he's mad at his boss?  Yeah.  For actually taking more money than he's paying you? 
[01:02:00]  He's the boss.  He's on easy street.  Easy street.  He's on easy street, Ant.  Oh, crap.  You can't deny that.  These people are delusional.  You can't deny that he's on easy street.  He makes a dime for every dollar the boss makes?  Good.  That's about right.  Without supposed to work.  That's about right.  I wish he could make a dime for every dollar the boss makes around here.  Oh, believe me.  Every dollar they make here?  Holy shit.  Yeah, a lot of dimes.  That is, that would be an amazing salary.  Be able to haul them all home.  Bunch of dimes.  I know.  You know, flanking around.  You have to call Ted's Dime Haul Incorporation. 
[01:02:30]  We haul dimes and we shine them, Gregory.  That's very pigeonholed business.  Certainly is very rarely used.  And, Ant, you know, because I got an agenda down there, I made sure I got a shot of Stilt  Woman.  It's a circus down there.  Of course it is.  This is better than Ringling Brothers.  They're idiots.  She's, on Stilt, she's got to be close to eight and a half feet tall, dressed kind of like  in that, what, like that laughing type of outfit.  Yeah, it's like a lot of, very colorful kind of. 
[01:03:00]  And she's got a sign.  What does that sign say?  I didn't even read it.  Insatiable growth is not sustainable.  True.  Okay.  Well, really?  True to a point.  Well, to a point.  I think when it gets to that point, though, they'll figure something else out.  Yeah.  Because they kind of need us in the end to feed into this bullshit.  Yeah.  Hit it.  I don't even know.  Hey there.  I think the internet.  Oh, pause.  This guy, the beauty of going down to any of these Occupies, man, they all want to be 
[01:03:30]  stars now.  Oh, yeah.  You just pop a camera in someone's face and they will start talking immediately because  they're all looking to be the big Occupy Wall Street star.  The next big one, yeah.  Yeah.  So this guy has a theory about the internet that he needed the world to hear.  Hey there.  I think the internet has brought all the brain cells, all the parts of the brain, Belgium,  South America, Africa, they're all coming together on the web.  And we all know that we are the same person. 
[01:04:00]  We are one person.  All of us.  Douchebag!  Pause, pause, pause.  See, okay.  You must have caught some shit for that.  What?  Well, after that guy talks, you edited it to the point where the other guy yells,  Douchebag, implying that what that guy said made him a douchebag.  Well, I'm having a little fun.  I mean, you know, I'm an artist, so I'm having fun with the clips I get.  I collect the clips and then I mold it into something.  But the guy is a douchebag!  Thank you.  So maybe that was my way of calling him a douchebag. 
[01:04:30]  But the problem is, am I wrong?  What has he got as a microphone?  A Donald Duck microphone.  Donald Duck.  With a little sign that says what?  Occupy yourself.  Yourself.  Yeah.  How about go fuck yourself?  He looks like Richard Hatch, by the way.  Doesn't he?  Yeah.  And then we go back to the guy that a lot of people think is either me, Eastside Dave,  or Dane Cook.  Okay.  I thought it was Eastside Dave at first.  For the first second I saw him.  Oh, really?  When he was yelling.  Because Eastside Dave loves yelling.  Oh, yeah.  And falling down.  I got an incredible idea for Eastside Dave. 
[01:05:00]  I got to get a hold of him.  He'll do it.  Yeah, I know.  You just know he'll do it.  Because in general, I'm not setting up videos.  I set up one so far, but I might set up a second, because I got a great idea for Eastside Dave.  How do you not want to use Eastside Dave or something like that?  Yes.  Hit it.  Of course.  Douchebags!  Americans are douchebags!  Now we've got the temptation for being done, idiot!  Oh, no.  Pause.  What you can't see, hopefully you'll check out this video later. 
[01:05:30]  I would appreciate it.  But you got a guy with a sign, and this shit's everywhere.  He's scarfing down some McDonald's french fries.  Yeah, a little McDonald's french fries.  McDonald's is a publicly traded company down on Wall Street.  I'm sure they make a lot of money.  I'm sure they don't pay their employees 10% of what the owners of the franchises make.  Eh, sure.  10%?  10%.  Well, a dime for every dollar.  Oh, I know.  Mr. Song-fucking-meister, you tuning son of a bitch. 
[01:06:00]  I would assume the average McDonald's employee doesn't even make a penny compared to the  dollar the boss is making.  No, you're a toonsmith.  Did you ask any of these people, because that'd be an interesting thing, like, without anger  at it, like, sir, you got this sign, you're eating McDonald's fries, like, because it  takes away their defensives if you're not attacking them, if you're really asking.  No, they will turn around like you call them a fucking shithead.  Maybe they will, but if there's a way to ask somebody something where they don't feel...  I'm glad you asked that, Jimmy.  Oh!  Oh!  Wait for the next video.  Oh, yeah! 
[01:06:30]  Wait for the next video.  Okay, okay.  Because this guy got me a thinking.  Okay.  Yeah, because he's scarfing down French fries as he holds up this whole sign about, you know,  1%, 99%, blah, blah, blah, blah, corporate Wall Street, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You can't be at Occupy, whatever, put your city here, and be scarfing down McDonald's.  And I'll say it again, the people that are really in charge behind the scenes, they got  to be walking around and go, and slap the fucking fries out of this guy's hand and go,  what the fuck are you doing?  What are you doing, man?  Because at this point, the world is watching. 
[01:07:00]  I'm one of hundreds of people with cameras down there on any given day.  Yeah.  Hundreds of cameras, all filming.  They love it.  So why wouldn't the organizers say, will you knock off the corporate shit while all these  cameras are on?  You're not the boss of me.  That's what I would say.  But in this one video, without even trying, you had fucking, you had a Starbucks guy,  and you got a McDonald's fries guy.  Peter Peltz is Steve's sign.  Right.  All right, hit it.  Freddy Fries.  We used to be the best country in the world. 
[01:07:30]  Now we're fucking shit.  That fucking league, you cunt.  This guy's giving the finger to America.  Oh, then, yeah.  Then I just.  Dippy bitch.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.  I like that.  I like that.  Occupy Wall Street shirts they're making.  Oh, pause this.  I'm so glad I got this shot.  Here's a guy.  I think he might have even been an old media newsman or something.  He kind of has that old journalist look to him. 
[01:08:00]  And he looks really familiar.  Yeah.  He's holding up a sign, which you'll be able to read in its entirety in a second.  But just to set it up, he's standing there looking like an old newsman with a long coat on.  He's being interviewed.  And I noticed while he's being interviewed, you got hippie chick.  Hippie chick is dancing in the background.  Like a lunatic with, by the way, her Uggs on.  Those are Uggs.  Uggs, by the way.  Another huge corporation.  Yes, of course.  Another fashion statement.  Who some would say love killing animals for their fucking Uggs, by the way.  And I would love to know what their practices are as far as employing people, maybe overseas. 
[01:08:30]  I'm not sure.  I'm just talking to my ass.  I'm not knowledgeable on this.  And maybe I'm completely wrong.  Right.  But I wonder if they have jobs in China that employ underage employees and don't give many benefits.  Sure.  Yeah.  Who knows?  You got the hippie chick with the Uggs.  She's right behind this, what looks like an old news guy.  That's a pussystang.  She's got her really nice animal hat on.  Oh, yeah.  Those are really expensive, too.  And wait till you see what the sign says. 
[01:09:00]  Nice jeans, too.  And you see she's looking like a lunatic dancing like a freak, right?  Yep.  Okay.  Grateful Dead type dance.  Watch this and pause it when you can read the whole sign.  All right.  Okay.  Media.  Please be honest about the spirit of this movement.  That's what I say when I take a shit.  The spirit of this movement.  So I decided, okay, I'll show you some honesty.  All right.  You're hoping the media is more honest about it because they don't think they're being honest.  And my shot shows a freak in the background with Uggs dancing like a lunatic. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  How is that helping the cause once again to the organizers?  Get rid of these weirdos.  So then maybe you will have more honesty.  It's hypocritical.  But that's as honest as you get right there in that shot.  It's very hypocritical.  You literally have to start – you can't eat McDonald's and drink Starbucks.  And if you're going to scold other people and scold corporations, then you have to – it's  like when the Westboro Church, when they're attacking Steve Jobs and people are like, but 
[01:10:00]  you're using iPhones.  Yeah.  And they're like, well, God created the – it's like once you start doing that, like,  yeah, but –  Yeah, yeah.  People are like, shut the fuck up.  I'm an exception.  And like I said a couple weeks ago, you would almost have to walk around there like a caveman.  I get it.  You can't get to that point maybe.  But at the very least, take your Uggs off, throw your stupid Starbucks away.  Your designer shit.  Or put it in a red cup.  You know what I mean?  So no one knows what kind of coffee you're drinking or the French fries. 
[01:10:30]  You can't have a McDonald's fucking logo as you're protesting the man.  The man.  And the machine.  Corporate fucking evilness.  Right.  Jesus.  All right.  This is a little rake.  We can move on, I guess, or – I don't even know what's – go ahead, I guess.  I don't like watching these videos.  Oh, the drums.  Oh, yeah.  Pause this.  What are they doing?  They're all pretty spiritual people.  Yeah, what are they doing?  What are they doing?  Well –  They're reading invisible books?  What are they doing?  Well, they're meditating.  But the problem with meditating in public, I think that goes against the whole meditation thing. 
[01:11:00]  It's for attention?  Yeah, they're just –  Especially when people are drumming like animals.  They're drumming like animals.  You don't see it in the shot.  But the drum circle can't be more than 25 feet away from them.  So it's drowning out your thoughts.  It's so fucking loud down there when they drum, which I like, by the way.  I like the drum circle.  But they're meditating.  And the lady is trying to – they're putting their hands out in front of them like this.  This looks like they're reading an invisible book.  Like they're holding an invisible book, looking at their palms. 
[01:11:30]  And unfortunately, I never understood why they were doing that.  But they can't be really meditating because you can't focus in that environment.  Most people meditate by themselves in the woods, at the beach, in a room in their house.  Maybe with a –  I like Masturbate too.  Yeah.  Same places.  Maybe with a small group in a yoga studio, whatever.  But you don't do it like this.  That's just trying to get attention.  This is silly.  Right. 
[01:12:00]  Did you come up with that?  I'll pause.  All right.  Ten years – oh, I remember this one.  Remember this?  We all got this one.  There's an old lady.  She has a sign.  Ready for this?  Ten years ago, we had Steve Jobs, Bob Hogan.  We had him a month ago.  And Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  Now we have no jobs, no hope, no cash.  We've all seen this, right?  I've never seen that until now, but I probably blocked it out.  You've never seen this?  That's terrible.  It's been everywhere since Jobs died.  But it's almost like, what did they do before that?  We just had no hope in cash? 
[01:12:30]  And then what did they do before Johnny?  We just had no hope?  Yeah.  How many names are you going to use?  You know, before that, we had no Kennedy.  Oh, that doesn't make sense.  Fucking idiots.  Dolt.  Oh, she doesn't look like she.  So I asked her if she came up with that, and she says –  Jumped ahead.  What does she say?  She says yes, and I go, no, you didn't.  Did you come up with that? 
[01:13:00]  No, you didn't.  Dummy.  And then this lady wants me to join the drum circle.  Get that fucking out of here.  Drum on your head.  That's been around the internet for a while.  Oh, okay.  That's not original.  That's a fucking Hebrew-sounding song there.  Jesus. 
[01:13:30]  I've been a gourmet fucking cook my whole life.  I still can't pay the rent.  That guy is great.  And fuck it.  Oh, God.  He's right, though.  I can't even –  He's right.  He's a gourmet chef, and he can't pay the rent.  He's a gourmet chef.  He's a saucier.  I'm saucier.  I have to be honest.  He's not right, by the way, Jimmy, because I know a little bit about the restaurant business  through my brother.  If he's a gourmet chef, that's real money, man.  That's some good fucking cash.  Maybe he has a drug problem.  He must suck at it.  Yeah, maybe he's not a good gourmet chef.  Maybe he does things with Count Chocula. 
[01:14:00]  You can't say you're a gourmet chef your whole life, and you can't pay the rent.  That's ridiculous.  Unless he's out of work because he can't find a job as a gourmet chef, maybe?  Yeah.  Hold on.  I have to read this tweet because it might be right.  I don't know if it's right.  Kevin K says,  Banks could not refuse government cash injections, and all bailout money was paid back with interest  and almost all ahead of schedule.  I don't know if that's true, but if it's true, well, then I didn't know that.  I'm an asshole.  But I have to say I don't know. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  All right, then.  Are we going to eat and go to break?  Yeah, let's get some eating going.  Oh, did you see this story, too?  Which one?  Two big stories.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah.  One is happening in New Brunswick tomorrow, Friday, Saturday.  It's Occupy Stress Factory, where I will be headlining my first shows.  A long time there.  I support this.  732-545.  Ha ha.  And the antisocial shows with this year, Bill Burr is not going to be there, and neither 
[01:15:00]  is Brewer.  But again, I keep stressing that it's not for any negative.  Bill and Jim are just doing other things.  But it's good to get new blood in there, too.  Yeah.  Because a lot of the people have seen those guys in this format, so it would be cool to  see other guys.  Yeah.  But those guys were a great part of it.  Of course.  But literally, it was both their decisions.  And so it's going to be myself, January 14th.  Me, Doug Stanhope, Dave Attell, Artie Lang is the show.  Pre-sale tickets today at 9 a.m.  This will sell out. 
[01:15:30]  C-O-M-C-A-S-T-I-X.  Comcasttix.com.  Password.  Antisocial.  9 a.m. this morning, the pre-sale starts.  Fuck, that's cool.  That's a good show.  And you're looking for a massage therapist to occupy your asshole.  I would like that, yes, with a big ring finger.  A big ring finger.  Yeah, a big, thick, sausage-y ring finger.  That's all you're asking for.  Occupy Stress Factory.  Sausage.  Stress Factory.  Those tickets got to be selling.  It's been a while.  It is doing well.  How many shows is that slave driver going to make you do? 
[01:16:00]  I'm doing five.  Five?  But I didn't do any press.  My publicist got me no one got me one fucking newspaper article.  I'm on a podcast tonight, which is great, but not one newspaper article in my hometown.  It's horrible.  You should be doing that local TV thing, too.  Little pics or something.  Start saying Will Ferrell's on drugs and you'll get some fucking press.  They just did nothing.  I talked to my age yesterday, but there's not one interview?  I'm not saying it's front page news, but not one?  There's places for that. 
[01:16:30]  You should be in some of those papers.  Hometown hero.  Makes good.  Makes good.  Right.  You're making good this weekend.  That's a stress factory.  Again, I realize that it's certainly not front page news, but it could be something.  Oh, something.  Exactly.  Page 17?  That'd be nice.  Not one fucking piece of press.  Bill Burr joining us today.  I heard he killed on Fallon.  I haven't seen it yet.  Oh.  And he's freely today.  Nice.  930.  I don't know why, but you're listening to the Opie and Anthony channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:17:00]  Let me tell you something.  Whenever you hear change, big change in Washington, we need change.  It's socialism.  I've had it.  I've had it with Democrats and liberals and people with this dream, this goddamn false dream that everyone's going to share. 
[01:17:30]  Go to Russia!  Goddamn communists!  They're all communists!  The commies are back from the 80s.  It's the new, improved 21st century communists.  This country's never a place where somebody comes and goes, take care of me!  When the frick did that happen?  It's a place that you work your ass off and you might make it. 
[01:18:00]  Some people will make it.  Some people won't.  Jesus Christ.  It's not friggin' Russia!  Goddamn communists!  Opie and Anthony!  Opie and Anthony!  Are you looking for that perfect gift?  Well, look no further.  Introducing the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  It's unbelievable.  This four-disc DVD box set, personally narrated by the famous self-deprecating comedian,  will show you some of the most notorious places to pick up women in one of the most dangerous cities in New Jersey. 
[01:18:30]  If I could, all I would do is rape jokes right now.  In this video, you'll learn how to properly approach a prostitute.  It's easy.  They do recognize you after a while.  They'll heckle you.  They'll yell things.  They keep riding around!  Hookers never like Sabbath.  I learned that.  I would only pick them up if they got in on the right side.  I would stop.  Shit like that.  How to avoid awkward situations when dealing with a hooker.  I remember one Puerto Rican chick got in my car and she was eating peanut brittle.  She sucked my dick and it was in the hole with that peanut smell.  I was looking at hookers!  And I stopped and the tranny walked over and snatched my glasses off and said, for wasting 
[01:19:00]  my time!  I actually high-beamed and flashed the cop and I'm like, she took my glasses.  I'll never forget it as long as I live.  And most importantly, how to spot a fake.  A lot of times people get fooled, man.  I never realized that a fucking guy would get tits.  It didn't occur to me.  I was getting hookers for a long time at that point.  We were fucking and it was pitch black in my car in Jersey City.  I knew.  Well, when I discovered that the lady was not quite the lady, I thought, it's like,  what am I going to do, talk to her manager?  I fucking dumped my load.  So don't be caught off guard and take this advice from someone who's been there time and 
[01:19:30]  time again.  I should be fucking the mouth with a rock.  It's the Jim Norton Guide to Jersey City Prostitution.  Available at adult bookstores everywhere.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Listen to this one.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera and he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go.  He has to go now. 
[01:20:00]  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  So I go there.  I open the door.  I'm going to open the door.  There's shit on my fingers.  So I'm like, what is this?  So I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  It's fresh.  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it.  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking.  And I look at him. 
[01:20:30]  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts.  I finally get up the stairs and I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have  fell out of his shorts.  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  There's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people just stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer. 
[01:21:00]  No theme, huh?  You rock.  What?  No, not from today.  What?  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Turn this down. 
[01:21:30]  What?  Turn this down.  Yeah.  All the way.  All right.  Why don't you go with your music themes today?  Because I don't know any Emerson, Lake, and Palmer shit.  What about Katie Lang?  She's 50.  Really?  Could have done something.  Jesus.  Can you make sure we have one for the next break?  I think, yeah.  Justin Bieber.  Bieber's in the news.  Yeah, what about Bieber?  He might have fathered a child.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  With a 20-year-old.  Yeah.  Kim Kardashian getting divorced.  Maybe you'd do a little divorce thing.  Yeah.  You think the Kim Kardashian thing was a real fucking marriage?  No.  You don't?  A money-making sham.  Yeah, but this Chris Humphries looks like a complete asshole, though.  Yeah?  He's a dope.  You think so?  Chris Humphries, he's a moron.  For playing into this bullshit?  He's an idiot.  Yeah.  They were doing, like, a TV show, and he got all swept up because Kim Kardashian was, like,  was willing to marry him, and he thought it was for easy. 
[01:22:30]  But you could tell.  I watched the show.  He's an idiot.  He's an idiot.  Yeah, he's a moron.  So they just picked out an idiot?  Well, I think they were probably really dating, and then they just rushed along this wedding  without putting much thought into it, knowing that, yeah, like, Kim knew, yeah, we could  get divorced.  Let's just get proposed and, or get engaged and married for the show.  So, and then Kim was like, yeah, this is stupid.  Like, she probably thought it would last, like, a year at least, and then realized 72  days in, this guy is a total idiot. 
[01:23:00]  I can't even.  Adult?  I can't be around this person anymore.  Yeah, but it was fake from the get-go because she was talking about how was she going to  go to Minnesota and live and have a career?  She was never going to live in Minnesota.  Of course not.  Who the fuck would buy that?  Chris Humphries because he's an idiot.  I think this is where it turns on Kim Kardashian, finally.  Yeah, she's got a lot of negative.  You could see it finally, that the people are fed up with this nonsense.  What's the negative, though?  Who liked her, and then because of this, they're like, oh. 
[01:23:30]  They fucking loved her, and the stupid ratings for the Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  I was discussing this yesterday on the way home.  I understand when people watch dumb shit on TV.  We all love watching dumb shit on TV, right?  Yeah.  But not to the extent that Keeping Up with the Kardashians is doing.  The numbers they're doing is unbelievable.  I've seen that wedding four times.  Who?  I watched it.  Who?  No one in our circles.  Who?  I've watched for a goof, I guess, here and there. 
[01:24:00]  For a goof!  I've never seen a show.  I don't think everyone's watching for a goof.  No, because there's a lot of women watching it, watching her deal with problems and living  this life.  But all these women feel like they trusted Kim in this fairytale wedding.  And I've talked to ladies who are actually like fan fans.  They finally had it?  They feel like they've been lied to.  And that Kim...  Oh, brother.  That they put their trust in Kim.  I was talking to somebody yesterday who works here, a female, who specifically...  Who is this bitch? 
[01:24:30]  Who specifically said...  And it wasn't Nicole.  Who specifically...  I didn't say anything.  I know, but you gave me a look.  I didn't say anything.  Because she is a little dopey, too.  She really is as dumb as they come in.  She is.  She's a dope.  Who Nicole is?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't wait to tell her.  Because you tell her everything I fucking say.  I'll tell her.  I'll tell her.  We'll bring her on the after show.  Say it to her face.  I will.  I will.  Does she know she's a dope?  I don't know if she knows, but she is.  Does Stan know?  I don't know if she knows, but she is.  Yeah, that's a great answer.  Stan is very fond of her.  I think Rich probably knows she's kind of a dope.  You think Stan knows, but denies it? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, Stan doesn't want to think she's a dope.  He just laughs at all.  Ah, Miss Nicole.  He's just, he's happy.  He's Ringo.  Yeah, he's Ringo.  Ah, just happy to be working.  Ravi.  Ravi told me.  I'm not blocking Ravi tweets, by the way.  Ravi.  I block chippers.  Yeah.  I block some chips when I'm a little angry.  I'm having some Ravioli.  Ravi.  All right.  And I've lost at least 1,000 followers because I had to block Bobo's. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  So fucking done with Bobo.  His stupid tweets.  Everyone that retweets the Bobo shit.  I'm so fucking done.  Yeah.  Ravi.  But the Ravi's are making me laugh.  What's going on with Bobo?  No, no, no, no, no.  Please, please.  And he's got to understand, just relax.  Go fucking enjoy your life and just relax.  He's the fucking worst.  We'll figure out how to have you back on the show someday when it makes sense. 
[01:26:00]  I'm going to be back on the show.  Oh, Pete said I was on back on the show.  He may be part of the Hard Rock event.  Really?  Oh, brother.  He's demanding a sit-down with you guys.  A sit-down.  Really?  Do you know?  So is my mom.  Both aren't going to get that.  Right.  The list of people that I would accept a sit-down with before Bobo, I can't even tell you how  long that would be and who it would involve.  But people you would think I would never sit down with.  And that's before Bobo. 
[01:26:30]  I would never waste a second talking to the likes of a Bobo.  Is that because he videotaped you while you were leaving the show?  No, but I deleted it.  But then he didn't.  No, because he showed it to me at Comic-Con later in the day.  Yeah, yeah.  He's an idiot.  He is.  He's just a moron.  Like Chris Humphries.  Chris Humphries and Bobo are just...  Now, I did tap out of Keeping Up with the Kardashians finally, so I didn't see the whole,  you know...  You didn't see the fairytale wedding?  I really didn't.  So why is he a dummy?  Because I haven't really seen him on the show. 
[01:27:00]  He's just a big galoot.  Like, he looks like a young Ron Perlman with that huge jaw.  And he's just a big dummy who didn't realize what was going...  Like, you could just tell.  There was no love there.  There was no...  So long for the ride.  Yeah.  He didn't know.  Yeah.  Did he think that he was really getting married?  Yeah.  He just fit the tuxedo.  Ah, like Johnny Bravo.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Did her acting get good where she made believe she was in love with this guy?  No.  Nobody...  I never for one second was like, look at the chemistry between these two. 
[01:27:30]  There was never...  They have no chemistry.  The fucking ladies are going to crucify Kim Kardashian.  Although I just...  I'm looking at...  I looked up on Google News Kim Kardashian trust to see...  But I think they've found the angle already.  What is it?  The first thing that comes up is Kim never got over Reggie Bush.  So now all the women are going to be able to relate to that.  Oh, I know.  Because Reggie Bush is the true love.  The lost love.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Of course.  They're spinning.  They're spinning it.  Oh, poor...  She's into Reggie Bush. 
[01:28:00]  I feel bad for Kim Kardashian.  Who wouldn't?  She's sexy, though, man.  She looks good when she's up here.  Yes.  She is fucking...  Really?  Yes.  Dude, she's fucking ridiculous.  She's not ugly, obviously.  She's hot.  Yeah.  She's fucking hot.  She's unbelievable.  I saw her in person.  In person, she's unbelievable.  Yes.  Fuck you, she looked good, man.  Yes.  Yeah.  Her sisters are good.  They all looked hot when they were up here.  Yeah.  She's much shorter than I thought.  Even Khloe, who looks like China.  She has a fidget.  I was surprised at how small she was.  I'm obsessed with Khloe, because I'm telling you, she has a different father. 
[01:28:30]  Why did they do that storyline?  She has a Bruce Jenner face.  Yes.  Bruce Jenner face.  And she's a foot taller than the other two, or so it seems.  She looks like the fucking Bigfoot Silva who beat up Fedor.  I mean, they dolly her up, put a little makeup on her, and everyone's, wow, jeez.  See?  Oh, my lord.  Is that a little Kim Kardashian right there?  Those are some big boobies.  Would you suck on those boobies?  Just known for being a fucking, like, what?  What is that?  What kind of fame is that?  I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  I don't get it.  I know.  I really don't get it.  I'd suck those tits.  I would literally suck those tits until her fucking hair was itching her brain.  Really?  I would suck those tits dry.  They're probably dry already.  I imagine they're just filled with something fake.  Sand.  I would just hold them.  I would literally want her to hold my head lovingly.  Yeah?  And nurse me.  Those big fat tits.  She's just a stupid airhead that doesn't even have a thought in her fucking brain.  It drives me nuts.  Dude, I would come on her and ignore the trigonometry questions. 
[01:29:30]  I don't care how dumb she is.  Look at that fucking rump.  That's a big rump.  Oh, is that juicy?  See that, Tim?  And help me out.  Wow.  The shape of it is nice, but that is a big rump.  Look at how deep those cheeks are.  She got some ass.  I don't think we're going out on a limb saying that.  Damn.  That's a big curve, but...  That's juicy, man.  There's a lot of fucking meat there.  There's a lot of ass.  Dude, that's fucking...  That is ridiculously hot.  She's attractive.  Fuck, man.  Yeah, I guess so.  Big, deep fucking ass cheeks. 
[01:30:00]  I bet you could put...  Literally, if you put your fingers in there, I bet almost your whole fucking up to your wrist.  Do you think you'd slip in there and...  I would worship her hiding.  When do you get to the naughty part?  Of the ass.  Where does it get dirty?  Yeah.  How many fingers before you hit the dirt?  Well, the middle one would always hit it first.  Probably the first one down.  But, I mean, how many fingers would be, like, disappear before the bottom finger hits the dirt?  Oh, you mean if you're coming in, like, on the side?  Like a karate chop.  Like a hi-yah!  A karate chop?  A karate chop her bunghole.  I bet you that the middle of the middle finger, or that much crack depth... 
[01:30:30]  Before the little finger hits the dirt?  I would lay on my back and have her open her ass.  Just open my nose and smell.  It's probably a sexy smell, man.  I think she smells like a fucking horse.  A horse?  Like a big fucking horse ass?  I'm telling you, man.  Ugh.  I don't know.  Because there's too much, like...  There's too much sweat could gather.  A lot of meat in there?  Yeah.  A lot of meat to gather, all that shit.  Look at her big fucking areolas.  She's like a booty clap, I bet.  She's hot, but she's so hot that the show should be doing that type of ratings, and she 
[01:31:00]  should be making all that fucking money.  Why?  I'm going to watch it.  Because of her areolas?  Now I'm going to watch it.  Just because of her areolas?  That's all I care about.  Oh, who's this broad, though?  So now this broad's mad at Kim Kardashian?  Oh, yeah, this chick that works here.  Yeah, I mean, and she's Armenian, so she thought her and Kim Kardashian had this connection.  Oh, really?  Now she said...  Kardashian would walk over a fucking stall to grab a dollar off the sidewalk.  She feels like Kim broke her trust with this whole fairytale wedding thing. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, boy.  I think those two kids just got swept up in it.  We'll see how Kris Jenner spins this one, because she's controlling the whole thing.  Oh, Jesus.  God, the fact that she just digs those black guys, that's hilarious.  She's a...  What did I call her?  She's a father with the fucking...  But she's not really...  But her father with the OJ thing...  She's exotic, though, man.  Yeah, but exotic is one thing.  You bet she is.  That's another.  Look at Reggie Bush, though.  It's like he is in shape.  Like, literally, when life...  If life is fair, he should be fucking her, and I shouldn't.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Look at the guy's an athlete in fucking perfect shape. 
[01:32:00]  But...  I don't deserve to fuck her.  I love how Sam calls Chris Humphries a dope, though.  He's a moron.  Have you seen him?  He's just...  Hello.  It's me, Chris Humphries.  He's just along for the ride.  They're just telling him all kinds of bullshit.  Okay.  Like, he hasn't processed that there's cameras around him.  And that we're doing a show.  Like, we...  Of course this is what happens.  Did you see the...  It's a TV show.  Did you see the picture that Jennifer Hutt tweeted?  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  She doesn't get that I'm being dead serious.  I wanted to get to a show.  I wanted to talk about this so bad.  Because she was doing this...  Because she...  Sam will show you.  She...  She got a picture with Susan Boyle.  Oh, really?  So I tweeted...  Oh, she's here, right?  Yeah.  She was here.  Susan Boyle was here?  Yeah.  So I tweeted...  Wow.  How the fuck did you get a picture with your old self?  This is a boy right there now.  Yeah.  She's everywhere.  Oh, boy.  So I write, how did you get a picture with your old self?  Because remember, she used to be fat. 
[01:33:00]  She was fat.  And she's like...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But I kind of meant it.  Of course she did.  But she doesn't understand I mean this shit.  Like, this is...  She...  Well, she likes to...  Oh, God.  That would be a picture with her old self.  Oh.  When she gained all that weight after her mom died.  I wish we could have got...  That's kind of cool.  Oh, she got a picture of Chris Farley, too.  That does look like Farley.  Yeah, shit.  Boyle is a fucking beast.  She's a disaster.  That is brutal.  But I...  She...  Why did...  I guess she came in too late. 
[01:33:30]  I would love to interview her.  What is she doing?  She didn't get in until like 3 o'clock.  She's got a new album or single out.  Gives a shit.  It's a cover, believe it or not.  She's fucking irrelevant.  She didn't write it herself.  Not really.  Or did she get some writers to write some shit for her?  I don't know.  I forget which...  This is like a famous song.  I forget which one it is.  What is it?  I don't know.  But yeah, Jennifer...  She just pretends like these horrible insults don't bother her.  Like, ah, they're just goofing around.  I'm like...  Like she said that on the after show.  Like, they're just goofing around.  I know it's just one of the guys.  They said horrible things. 
[01:34:00]  Like, Opie looked at you and said, you fool.  Like, it's just so disrespectful.  I called her a babbling fool or something.  Just dismissive and disrespectful.  It's not something you just say to your friends.  We killed her so bad, I requested that Troy Kwan try to put something together.  It was an unbelievable beating she took.  Oh, it was.  And I don't think she is aware how bad she got beat up that day.  Her Facebook was destroyed with the most obscene pictures anybody's ever seen.  I do remember that.  Yes, yes, yes.  You think she's crying inside? 
[01:34:30]  Of course she is.  Laughing on the outside.  She's in tears on the inside.  Yeah, she's...  Weeping.  Yeah.  This is almost as bad as what happened to her mom on the inside.  Wow.  Yeah, that's how bad it was.  But on the outside, it's all, you know, ah, ha, ha.  Oh, I get it, yeah.  Ah, ha, ha.  And then our fans, I'm sure, are still just saying terrible things.  Whenever I include her on a tweet, I get everything back about how nobody ever wants to listen to her. 
[01:35:00]  She's an attention whore, blah, blah, blah.  They say terrible things, so I know they're still saying them about her.  Like, she had no idea.  It's a week of residual effects of coming on this show, and she pretends, ah, it's all  in good fun.  All in good fun.  What are you going to do?  Sure it is.  And what's your take on the whole Kim Kardashian thing?  I know that's not your thing usually, but it is a huge story.  I would guess it's just a work.  It was a work.  That's what I think.  You know, apparently, what, they made a fuckload of money off the wedding? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Some say yes, some say no.  They must have, because E has aired that wedding literally the last four weekends in a row.  Four.  I've counted.  And I've watched.  At least part of it every weekend.  The last four weekends in a row this special has been on.  And they're making money off that, plus all the gifts and all the sponsorships.  But she took some of her dead dad's clothes and made teddy bears out of it or something  for the wedding, I heard.  Yeah, it was an emotional...  So if it's a work, why would she go to that extent?  That's creepy shit, man.  Part of the fucking work. 
[01:36:00]  I don't think that, like...  I think it's given her too much credit to say it's a straight, like, work, like, she  figured this out and this is all a scheme.  I think it was just like, okay, what do we do?  What if...  Ah, Kim, what if you marry this guy?  This season.  Like, what if we just do...  Okay, yeah, let's just do it.  Right.  And then they just kind of did it.  And they didn't really...  They're not thinking next step.  And he's adult.  And he's just like, okay, of course I'll marry you, Kim.  Like, great.  What are all these cameras doing?  So he was like the sacrificial lamb, you think?  Yeah, and they just saw he's not going to stand up for himself. 
[01:36:30]  He's just a dope.  Like, we could just...  Well, why wouldn't he be in on it?  Because he's just malleable.  There's no reason for him to be in on it.  But you could pay him some nice cash.  But why waste the money?  He's a moron.  He'd probably sign something when he gets nothing.  Yeah, yeah, and they signed a prenup beforehand that was, like, ironclad.  Yeah.  So, of course, they were just like, we don't even have to let this guy in that this could  end up horribly.  Why do you watch this show?  It's fun.  I mean, I like looking at the girls, and I think it's funny.  Oh, look at that.  That's the first thing. 
[01:37:00]  I like looking at the girls and their tits.  Yeah.  No, I think it's a funny show.  It's like, it's crazy that it's on TV.  Why is it crazy?  It's no worse than soap operas.  Like, literally, I'm thinking of that, but I'm thinking of Luke and Laura's wedding.  That probably did bigger viewers than Kim Kardashian's, and that, to me, has no more  integrity than this nonsense.  It's the same shit.  Phony soap opera.  Yeah.  At least this is just real people without, you know, at least they're real people.  Supposedly, she made $17 million for the rights, selling the rights to her wedding.  Wow. 
[01:37:30]  Jesus.  Her fake wedding.  She's not dumb.  Her fake fucking wedding.  No, she is dumb.  Her mom is running the show.  Oh, okay.  Kris Jenner's running the whole fucking show.  Do you think?  Yeah, she's already pimping out.  Yeah, I bet she's running the whole fucking show.  Yeah, let's do the whole fucking cast.  She's already pimping out the two younger daughters to kind of, you know, be the next  stage of this.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The ones she had with Bruce.  With Bruce Jenner.  They'll have their own show.  They will, right?  Yeah, they'll have it.  I mean, if it's not already in development, yes.  And Bruce Jenner just sits there.  Hey, girls!  And hopes they don't beat him up at night when he's sleeping. 
[01:38:00]  I watch these episodes, and it's like Bruce Jenner, this Olympic gold medalist, is trying  to tell his teenage daughters not to steal his credit card and go buy clothes, and his  daughters are just like, whatever, dad, whatever.  Just fucking, he's nothing.  It was like, shut the fuck up, dad.  He's nothing to, yeah.  Burn victim wig in his bad work.  He won gold medals, and they could give a fuck.  Yeah.  I wish my dad won a gold medal.  That would be pretty cool.  Fourteen-year-old models are just like, shut up, dad. 
[01:38:30]  You're so stupid.  They just run the house.  Fuck you.  You don't know what you're talking about.  Cutty Cut.  What whore is this?  You're an idiot.  And then Kris Jenner, the mom there, she wants to be more famous than any of them.  Oh, Kris Jenner's the best because she realized that her bladder was spotting, and she became  very proud of herself because she turned it into a positive by becoming a corporate spokesperson  for, like, Depends or something.  One of the adult diapers.  That's what you want to hear.  She's spotting? 
[01:39:00]  She's spotting.  She's literally making lemonade.  All that money, and she can't keep her pussy from making bingo dots all over the floor?  Jesus Christ.  It was urine.  Whatever it is.  Who wants to hear that fucking drip, drip, like a leaky pipe?  Who the fuck wants a leaky pipe for a fucking wife when you got that kind of money?  Yuck.  Put a sock in your pussy.  Cut it out.  Little yellow dots on the sheets.  Fucking terrible.  What are you, a fucking twister set?  Bruce just plays golf and plays with his model, what, fucking planes, whatever the fuck  it is?  Bruce doesn't care, as long as there's cash coming in and he can go play golf or whatever. 
[01:39:30]  He's fine with it.  I'm in this stage of life.  Let the cameras roll.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't give a fuck.  I did what I had to do in the Olympics.  I'm done.  Exactly.  I bet when his wife is, he's probably looking at himself on a Wheaties box and then heard  dripping piss in the linoleum.  What happened?  How'd this happen?  How'd they get here?  Yeah, these three twats are fucking milking me for every dollar.  This one's leaking tinkle all over the town.  All over the town.  His teenage daughter's just flipping him off.  Fuck you, Dan.  Getting zero respect from his kids. 
[01:40:00]  Then he catches himself in the mirror looking like he's wearing a Halloween mask.  He has hair like the Michael Myers mask on Halloween.  Beautiful.  Fucking hairdo stinks.  Looks like Rick Dees.  What were some of the topics this year on Keeping Up with the Kardashians?  That's the thing.  There are no topics.  Wasn't there like a birth control episode?  Yeah, I mean, they made a whole episode out of the mom having this problem with spotting  and now I've turned it into a positive and they were playing with the little diaper 
[01:40:30]  pads and throwing them at each other, these girls.  I'm getting worried that Kris Jenner's on Channel 4 right now.  She was in here yesterday.  Who gives a fuck?  Were all of them in here or just one?  No, just Kris.  Just the mom.  She was nice.  I met her once.  How frozen is her face these days?  It's pretty frozen.  She can't move.  You saw it?  Yeah, because it's all Botoxed up.  I think Kim Kardashian had some kind of stuff done to her face because her face, if you  just look at her face, it looks exactly like her mom's face now.  God, why do the women do that?  She's only 31. 
[01:41:00]  I thought she was younger.  Especially at that age.  What are they doing?  They all go too far.  Yeah.  And it looks creepy.  Yeah, it is really fucking...  That is just weird looking.  What's the name who came in here fucking her whole fucking forehead doesn't move?  Oh, yeah, when she couldn't...  And she's proud of it.  I'm like, will you stop?  Yeah.  Don't do that to yourself.  I'm just glad Khloe is still a natural beauty.  She's a beast.  I call her the workhorse.  I describe the Kardashians as horses. 
[01:41:30]  You got Kourtney.  She's like the show pony.  Yeah.  She's a little thing.  And then you got Kim, who obviously is the thoroughbred.  And then you got fucking Khloe is the workhorse.  Clydesdale?  The Clydesdale, right.  Oof.  Yep.  She's a bruiser, man.  I told Jess about your Bruce Jenner theory.  Because she watches a Kardashian...  What was my Bruce Jenner theory?  About Bruce being the father of Khloe because they look alike.  Yeah, no doubt in my mind.  And she watches all the time.  And now it blew her mind when you said that.  Because now she's like, holy shit. 
[01:42:00]  She looks exactly like Bruce.  Yes.  Why won't they talk about it?  I don't know.  Because obviously that would mean, I guess, the mom there was...  Was having some intercourse.  Doing a little cheating on Mr. Kardashian there.  Yeah.  It's...  Look!  Oh my god.  You don't have two daughters by the same parents and they're that drastically different.  They're whole...  The coloring, everything.  Fucking Khloe's hips are up to...  Is that Kim?  That's Kourtney.  Kourtney.  It looks like Kim.  But that's the thing.  Kourtney and Kim look exactly alike.  Right.  They look like sisters. 
[01:42:30]  I would put my cum, though, in the tall one.  Like, literally, I would...  If I would fuck her, I would let her wrap her big, long, fucking monster legs around me.  And I would hold her ass cheeks and just grunt and come at her.  She, without a doubt, would be the best fuck.  Maybe, yeah.  She's a big girl.  Not the best to look at.  We all know that.  But she would give you a ride.  I wouldn't want her riding me, though, because I'd be afraid she'd land on my dick and bend  it.  Ow!  Because she's probably so used to basketball players at my cock.  She's used to coming up on nine and coming back down.  And after four, she'd fucking, like... 
[01:43:00]  You'd see my dick wetly flop out of her vagina.  She goes up thinking it's nine.  Now she has to come down like she's playing ring toss.  Because she has to...  Exactly.  Hold it steady.  She'd have to, like, have...  I'd have to put my thumb on the base to keep it straight.  Oh, fuck.  So her fucking big lips fell onto it.  I love her.  So she's all in thinking it's Bruce's daughter?  Oh, yeah.  Now she is.  Dude, I mean, it's...  And the other two, like, Kourtney and Kim... 
[01:43:30]  Dude, are tiny.  And Khloe's even taller than the brother, unless, you know, she wears big heels.  How big is Bruce?  I didn't know he was that tall.  Bruce is tall, man.  He's, like...  Oh, yeah, look.  Yeah.  How tall is he?  Yeah.  I'm going to guess...  Is he 6'2"?  I didn't know that.  I think he's 7'5".  Oh, I was off by 13 inches.  The brother looks like Kourtney and Kim, but nobody looks like Khloe.  Except for Bruce Jenner.  We're the only ones in the media that are not letting this go.  And no one else will go with this with us. 
[01:44:00]  Just join us on this one.  Those mouths that kind of upturn a little bit, the Kardashians, and then hers is just  like Bruce Jenner's.  And look at the complexion.  There's no difference to any of their complexion.  None.  Bruce Jenner looks like a composite sketch.  It's just like the one with the hair and his facial feature.  It just...  His facial features are just being erased.  Yeah.  Right?  His eyebrows are almost non-existent.  He's very odd-looking.  His eyes are getting tinier. 
[01:44:30]  Odd-looking.  I don't get this whole fucking phenomenon.  They're making fun of...  It drives me nuts.  Robert, the brother.  I'm honest about it.  They're the most unimportant people on the planet to me.  Like, literally, I would love a photo with them just because I'm a piece of shit.  But they're utterly of no entertainment value to me.  I could give a shit what happens to them.  You must have not seen the episode then when Lamar Odom found out the brother, Robert, was hiding coffee cakes under his bed.  Why is that bad?  He likes junk food.  And who would give a flying fuck?  Well, he was trying to lose weight. 
[01:45:00]  Uh-huh.  You see?  Oh, but he found the coffee cakes.  He found the coffee cakes under the bed.  What are the IEDs he was hiding under his bed?  Rob's losing weight?  Robert.  Yeah, Robert.  Because Chris Jenner said lose some fucking weight.  He was getting a little chubby.  Yeah.  But he loves his coffee cakes.  He runs that fucking family.  All right.  But, yeah, I mean, it's brutal how much I could give a shit about that family.  I think it would be fun if one of them had, like, a really bad fire or a fucking fell down a flight of steps. 
[01:45:30]  But they're just silly.  Look at a picture of Chris Humphries and tell him he doesn't look like a fucking idiot.  He doesn't look like a dope.  We tried to interview him at the fucking, uh, at the, uh, I can't remember the name of the place anyway.  It was a fucking attempted interview and he was kind of a dick about it.  He was?  Yeah.  He's Cro-Magnon.  Oh, was it at the, uh, the fashion show?  Yeah.  No, no.  Oh, the fashion show?  Yeah, he was doing an interview.  And I didn't recognize him. 
[01:46:00]  Like, let's get him.  And he's like, oh, thank you.  Duh.  Did someone say there's 10 inches and a foot?  What?  I didn't.  Who said that?  Maybe I did because I said 13.  I was just doing math.  Oh.  Like, you said 7-5.  Oh.  I did 75 minus 6, too.  I just did a quick math.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Probably wrong.  Bill Burr is walking down the hall.  So why don't we take a break and we'll have Bill Burr join the festivities next.  Really, really, really.  You want to do that?  Oh!  Going into break.  Episode 3 of Uncle Paul.  Oh, good.

In today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about a young Macaulay Culkin.  In the movie, My Girl.  I was crying a lot in the theater when I seen that one. 
[01:47:00]  I couldn't see through my tears.  I had such a big lump in my sweatpants.  I love that movie.  Look at that.  You're all rough.  You got leaves on you.  Come here.  Let me muss your hair up.  Come here, Macaulay.  Look at your denim coat.  I cried so hard.  He got the bees all over him.  I was like, be careful.  Whoa, they're going to start stinging you on your penis.  Got to get someone to suck the person out.  You got little bee stingers in your penis. 
[01:47:30]  Why don't you come over here?  Let me get the bee stingers.  Your bee stingers.  Let me pull him out with my teat.  I'll rescue you.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.

[01:50:00]  We're playing Justin Bieber, huh?  I'm wondering why we're playing Justin Bieber.  Can you turn that down for a second, E-Rock?  Getting topical with the sex man.  So, E-Rock, why are we playing Justin Bieber?  Yeah.  Why are we playing Justin Bieber?  A new segment, I guess.  Yes.  It's a new segment.  Why is he pissing him? 
[01:50:30]  He's rolling his eyes.  He's so pissed.  He hates when we do bits that involve him and don't tell him.  But it's my favorite thing to do.  But he's not smart.  He's not smart enough to know that we set this up last break.  That's the whole reason.  You didn't know the sex man segment was coming up?  No.  See, that's your segment when you come back and rejoin the show with a song that has some kind of theme to it.  Yeah, we're going to play this.  You talk over the bed, E-Rock.  Getting topical with the sex man. 
[01:51:00]  Well, in case you didn't know, Justin Bieber was hit.  What?  Sorry, E-Rock.  It's important.  What?  Yeah, answer the hotline.  Oh!  We're trying to get topical here with the sex bagel.  Sex man.  Why not sex bagel?  Sex bagel is so 2010.  Yeah, it's the sex man.  He's the sex man.  We got Colin.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:51:30]  And we got Bill Byrne's studio, who killed on Jimmy Fallon.  We'll talk to Bill in a second.  Of course, you could...  How would you know?  Huh?  How would you know?  Because people are fucked up.  You asshole.  You didn't even watch it.  I told you I didn't watch, so now you're using that against me.  I am.  I said I DVR'd it.  Oh, my God.  You should have seen it.  So should have I.  That's all right.  I will watch today.  But people on Twitter said you killed.  That's all I'm saying.  I survived.  All right.  Colin Quinn, everyone.  Colin.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Colin.  Hello, Colin. 
[01:52:00]  You sound like a beaten man after yesterday.  Just chill and listen to some music.  Oh.  Can you know again, Pat?  What's he doing?  He's listening to Bieber.  He's a believer.  You love the Biebs.  I'm a believer.  What's up, guys?  Bill, you heard about Colin?  He's in deep trouble today.  Oh, I heard all about it.  Yeah.  It was trending.  Colin Quinn was trending yesterday on Twitter.  Yes, he was.  It's scary how stupid they are, isn't it? 
[01:52:30]  It's ridiculous.  It really is, like, you continually expose these idiots for what they are.  Yeah.  Just, like, knee-jerk, no research whatsoever.  All you would have to do is search Colin Quinn's Twitter, and you'd realize he's done this before,  and it's documented, why take everything he says on Twitter as fact and print it like,  oh, my God, he's accusing...  He means it.  Because he means it? 
[01:53:00]  Did you mean it?  Oh, okay.  My mistake.  I started out the morning on a positive note talking about the potential intriguing employment stuff going on with me in the show business.  And then I just mentioned that Will Ferrell stole Iger Man from me.  Yeah, of course.  Then, of course, I made up the drug thing, so that becomes a big thing, the drug thing, you know.  And they ran with it.  They ran with it.  Did you hear from anybody?  Because that's, like, because you...  Yes, that's why I had to say, hey, man, you know.  First, my manager was like, hey, you know, I was getting in control, but then I was like, nah, man. 
[01:53:30]  That's what we always do, too.  Nah, man.  We're like, nah, man.  This is good.  We know it, right.  This is good.  We know.  So did you send out a tweet that finally said it was a joke, you fucking retards?  Yeah, but I want to hear, leading up to that, so then the manager is going,  whoa, Colin, and you're like, come on, man, this is all right.  And then what happened?  First, my manager answers the phone to his credit.  Yeah.  They go, we asked, one side goes, we asked Colin Quinn's manager for a response with a  column of series, and he just laughed and laughed and hung up. 
[01:54:00]  Is that what your manager's doing, laughing and hanging up?  That's good.  That's what you want your manager to do.  That's very professional.  Yeah, yeah.  When all hell's breaking loose, that's what you want from your manager.  He goes, ha, ha, ha.  Click.  Yeah.  I actually like that.  Me, too.  Treat them like the idiots that they are.  Yeah.  Right.  Don't dignify it with a response.  So did Will call you or his manager?  Because what happened where you finally had to go, like, look, you morons, I was joking.  Yeah, because I know Will, and I know his manager.  His manager's like, hey, man, you know, I'm getting like 50 calls.  Can you please say something? 
[01:54:30]  Can you please say something?  I am saying something.  It was just about the drugs.  Yeah, of course.  I go, what is, I said, tell Will I'm sorry.  He goes, she's on a plane.  I didn't even know any of this is going on.  He's going to be like, Will, what's your drug problem?  You know.  Yeah.  You know what you should have said, Kyle?  You should have said, will he be mad?  That's a good one.  Is that Chip?  Of course.  Will's it a big?  It's hard to tell Chip from Jim these days. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  I can't even argue with him.  So, so, Will Farrell, have you heard from Will Farrell at all?  No.  No.  I don't want to, but really, you know, what's he going to say, you know?  Well, I don't know.  That's just it.  It was my whole thing, you know?  So you're still not, you're not letting that, not letting that one go, are you?  No, I was like, hey, I'm Ron Burgundy.  I would come in the office joking around like that.  Same name and everything.  Wow.  My favorite tweet was when you said that, like, Lauren was falling apart and you were calling the shots. 
[01:55:30]  Calling the shots.  Yeah, and people were tweeting back at me like, you won't call in shit, you know?  But of course, even in a couple of media things, you know, Colin Quinn claims that he was, you know, running SNL secretly, you know?  Yeah.  What dummies?  They're just stupid.  That was the tweet that got them that I was calling the shots over at SNL.  Yeah.  But it's amazing how stupid they are.  Like, they literally just, like we said before, copy and paste what some other person has written or a blogger, and they don't do any homework or read the context in which these tweets are written.  No.  Did, uh... 
[01:56:00]  Thanks for adding to that.  That was your turn, Colin.  Yeah, exactly.  That was your turn.  I fucking hit the ball.  That was the setup.  I hit the ball over the net.  What?  It's hard when you're at the studio.  Yeah, it is.  You feel out of the loop.  You feel like, I feel like everybody's sitting there after each silence going, okay, let's get off this goddamn phone now.  No.  A few people have rolled their eyes, but that's about it, really.  Do you know, Colin could do that again today, and people will still just think he's for real? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  They're idiots.  They do no research whatsoever.  How many followers do you lose?  Well, at first I lost 800 at the beginning, but then I got a couple more.  Now I'm back.  I'm almost even to where I started yesterday.  It's like Twitter blackjack.  Yeah, I'm about even.  His Twitter stats is like a roller coaster.  You're insane.  Yeah.  Every time, you're finally over 100,000, but every time you got close, you decide to blow it up and lose.  But this is exactly how Twitter should be used. 
[01:57:00]  Like, anyone who takes it seriously is an asshole.  I mean, Colin is mocking the whole thing.  I love it.  The best is when, like, some guy attacks, you know, like some guy attacks for me, and they start attacking him.  Poor idiot.  This doesn't get it.  I'm like, they just ruined him.  Like, some girl yesterday was like, sounds like somebody's jealous, you know?  Yeah.  Spreading negativity makes you look like a fool.  And guys are like, shut up, you dirty hole. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, they react to a spitball with a howitzer.  One guy just writes back, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  That's probably one of ours.  Yeah, probably.  I'm being polite.  You think so?  Yeah.  I love those people who try to get philosophical and teach you a life lesson through a tweet in 140 characters.  You're going to get enlightened.  You know, as Confucius always said.  Shut the fuck up. 
[01:58:00]  You think Confucius used the letters U-R for your?  Yeah, when he was trying to write U-L.  That was very funny, Jimmy.  That was a good one.  Ooh, that's it.  Look at the big book out there from Chris Matthews.  Yeah.  The scumbag who wouldn't come on our show.  Talking about JFK.  Hey, it's really, it's really, this is why we need another book about JFK because we don't know every fucking thing.  Did you know he fucked Marilyn?  Why wouldn't he come on your show?  Because he's a douchebag.  That's why. 
[01:58:30]  He was booked and then, you know, a dumb excuse was had.  Which means he found out, I guess, who we are or something.  Yeah, his publicist probably listened to the show.  He was like, oh, shit.  You don't want to go on that show.  Yeah, they'll actually read your book and then tell you what they think of it.  And they don't care about your influence in this business.  It's a look inside his childhood.  Gives a shit.  Gives a shit.  A privileged fucking childhood.  What's that?  He's from Philly.  No, he means JFK.  Oh. 
[01:59:00]  I read a book about it when I was a little kid.  By the way, I know I'm going to get disconnected by U-R for this.  When I was a little kid, because you guys are going to be signaling it.  Yay.  No, no.  I read a book about JFK.  And it really was quite an impacting book.  He used to eat toast.  He had a fight.  He had a piece of toast.  And he got on the bus.  And he had a fight with a kid who turned out to be his best friend.  That's always a nice way to start things off.  Humorous anecdote.  Yeah, I wish you were here yesterday.  We could have had Chris Matthews in an hour on that.  So the toast incident, Chris.  Did you write about that?  Go. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, you...  Use toast as a metaphor for what JFK was.  Yeah.  Like he was wearing toast on his head and it got shot off.  A bunch of jelly.  A bunch of jelly.  Someone threw butter from the grassy gnoll.  Well, the only uncalled for thing yesterday was in the middle of each Twitter war and all these media things was once in a while somebody would just trash and go,  and by the way, Voss stinks.  Voss never gets off unscathed. 
[02:00:00]  But by the way, Kyle, this is why...  He did.  This is why I told you you should have gone on Piers Morgan without warning that producer.  You should have just, on TV, just said, it's a joke.  You should have shamed them.  You were too nice.  That was for the other one, yeah.  I know, I know.  But I'm saying, you should have shamed them publicly.  Unbelievable.  How about the fact that I get off the end train, I had to go do a, like, a little thing.  Oh, don't call it that.  Oh.  I get off the end train. 
[02:00:30]  Everyone knows that's the D.  Of course.  About 1130 at night, I come up my station.  There's a picture of Bill Burr on the middle of the car.  I would have loved to have seen that picture of your face.  Did you just look down at your phone real quick and not look up until you were on 56th?  No, I just took my phone and I made somebody take a picture of my face over his.  I don't think we could believe anything Colin says anymore. 
[02:01:00]  No.  Confirmed Twitter liar.  Nothing but lies.  Just a phony baloney.  Yep.  Yeah.  Mr. Quinn.  Yeah, you better go back to tweeting or something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, Colin, you could have been uplifting with your fame instead of spreading  all that negativity.  You're right.  You're right.  Like one of the Kardashians, that's why they have 10 million followers, because they put  in positivity.  Yeah.  What was your...  When I started the morning, that's a positive note.  So I was saying really good stuff.  What was your favorite headline you read yesterday about yourself?  I don't know. 
[02:01:30]  I didn't really...  What is it?  Colin Quinn slams.  Let's see what this one says.  Colin Quinn tweets that Will Ferrell had a bad drug problem, and they just go over my  timeline.  And they even have my early day, like in the early part of the day, I was tweeting like  feeling a lot of good things going on in the world right now for me.  A lot of positivity.  And they tweet those, too.  They don't even explain like why you said that.  Exactly.  Like they're a bunch of idiots.  Can they look at you and realize you couldn't feel good?  No, they know he's joking around. 
[02:02:00]  They're just taking it seriously.  Because they're pandering to the morons.  Something to talk about, yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You think that plays into it, too?  They don't care if it's right.  Then when I'm walking in Walmart someday after a crummy gig in the road, some old lady's  going to throw something at me.  You leave Will Ferrell alone.  I just love that he just said crummy, like he was on Leave it to Beaver.  Crummy.  Gee.  Gee, Beave.  That's crummy.  That guy's a creep or something.  Yeah.  They're all sticks in the mud, Carl.  Don't be such a wet end.  What's a wet end? 
[02:02:30]  What's a wet end?  It's just like a drip.  I don't know if I heard that one before.  I get drip.  Yeah.  It's like a drip.  Yeah.  I love that expression.  Drip.  Wet noodle.  Drip is great.  I like.  Yep.  Well, Colin, congratulations on the big fame thing yesterday.  Thanks.  You would think it would have increased my Twitter followers by like, you know, seven  folds.  No.  That is like broke even.  Yeah.  Cash in and just walk out.  Walk away.  I'm really a non-event. 
[02:03:00]  Turns out to be a non-event.  I'm a living non-event.  You get headlines all over the country and the world.  You run them in the mail.  And you can't get more followers.  Yeah.  That proves that Twitter's just bullshit.  I get headlines about Twitter.  And I still look at it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's a Twitter thing.  Horrendous.  It's very funny, though.  He goes, horrendous.  All right, guys.  All right, Colin.  Thank you for the update.  Thanks for the exclusive interview, by the way.  We have the exclusive first words.  We did it the best with the Chris Matthews interview.  Did we call and wake you up? 
[02:03:30]  What a burn.  Well, you guys called earlier this morning.  I mean, you really should be more considerate, you know.  It's only early hours.  Colin Quinn trashes Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That wouldn't even make the fucking O&A news.  You think you're a non-event.  In O&A news.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jimmy did say your fingers are very brittle.  Yes.  They look like they could snap very easily.  We were just saying things about your physical appearance which weren't necessarily complimentary. 
[02:04:00]  When the hell was that?  Earlier today when you didn't pick up the phone.  Yeah, we got very angry.  At 6.15, you guys get angry?  Yeah, we got very angry you didn't pick up your phone at 6.15.  Heaven's sakes.  Jimmy said I have an old Irish lady's finger.  Yeah, we just would pick up.  Cancer or something.  Well, there was a song that this guy did about you, so we were just adding lines to it.  Really?  Was it a nice song?  No, it was stupid.  It wasn't bad.  It wasn't a nice song.  It was dumb. 
[02:04:30]  He sang your tweets from yesterday, I think.  Oh.  Well, it happens, you know.  Let's get some fucking royalty money from him.  Yeah, someone will tweet you the link if you want to check it out for yourself.  You won't want to.  Yeah.  No, I know, because by the time I get to it, somebody's going to mess around and suddenly it'll  be about my brittle fingers and all that.  Yeah.  You don't need people futzing around with that.  No, that's right, Jim.  I don't.  All right, buddy.  All right, pal-y.  All right.  Well, I hope you guys have a great rest of the show.  And I hope Bill and Jim have a strained breakfast afterwards. 
[02:05:00]  Jesus.  All right, buddy.  All right, Colin.  See you again.  Colin Quinn, there you are.  Oh, there he's funny.  A strained breakfast.  What is it?  I am Colin Quinn on Twitter?  Yes.  With two N's at the end?  I am, yes, Colin Quinn.  Quinn with two N's.  Bill Byrne's studio.  He's brilliant.  Kim Kardashian's hair looks just like the chicks in the shampoo commercial.  You've got to admit, as much as we were all let down by that sham of a marriage,  I mean, I don't know about you.  I was living vicariously through it. 
[02:05:30]  Were you?  But, no, I could get her shit.  Who cares?  She does have great hair.  I just can't believe, you know, how she scammed all those poor people over at People Magazine.  Like, I don't know how they're going to get back on their feet.  I don't know.  A lot of people upset with her, apparently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  I really could care less.  Fight.  Yeah.  She's fucking gorgeous.  She's amazing.  She deserves to lead everyone around by the nose.  You know what?  That's why.  You know, because she's out of everybody's league. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  And she did exactly what those fucking out-of-the-league chicks do to you in bars.  Lead you on, you bought her a drink, and then she just walks away from you.  Yeah.  Look at her.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Phenomenal.  Jesus.  Hey, Christ.  Christ.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Hey, Bill, I've got to ask you about Scandinavia.  Scandinavia.  You went on a tour there.  Kim Kardashian would be just another pretty face.  Really?  No one would even notice her.  Oh, did I tell you about that fucking supermodel I saw that did a face plant in the crosswalk? 
[02:06:30]  No.  In Stockholm, Sweden.  It was fucking hilarious.  She was like, she was drunk, so she like fell in slow motion, right?  Her face is going right to the pavement.  She's crossing against the light, by the way.  Oh, damn her.  And at the last second, she turned her head, and I swear to God, like a lawn dart.  All her weight landed right on her ear.  Oh, fuck.  And then she just lays there and starts crying, right?  What'd you do?  Nothing.  And then I just stood there, and I yelled in, like, accented English, ah, you might want  to get up, you know, because the cars were coming. 
[02:07:00]  And she just laid.  She was so fucking hot.  She just laid there, expecting the world and the traffic to stop.  And you know what?  It did.  It did.  It stopped.  Dude, if I was laying there, they would have ran over me.  They would have ran over your foot.  Why didn't you go over to help her?  Because traffic wouldn't have stopped if I went out there.  Really?  They would have knocked out both my knees, and then this bitch would have got up and never  would have noticed.  They would have thought you knocked her down.  Never would have thanked me, and I would have limped for the rest of my life, and she  would be like, oh my God, you guys.  Sell yourself like it.  My ear.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  That was tremendous.  Wow.  How many dates did you do over there?  I did five cities in seven days.  It was a thrash.  I went London, Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, and Stockholm.  I was doing this bit about Hitler, which is fucking hilarious, because when you're in Europe  and you talk about Hitler, every country you go to either got bombed by him or is embarrassed  because they chose his side.  It got really fucking weird, which of course is something I enjoyed.  What kind of a Hitler thing could you bring up? 
[02:08:00]  You don't have to do the bit.  I mean, just topic.  I was saying, it always fascinated me that people would follow him because he never seemed  composed to me.  He seemed like such a spaz.  Like, nobody else is going, this guy's kind of out of his fucking mind.  His hair's all sweaty, flopping around, right?  I just don't, it's just, other than what he did, his speeches are fucking hilarious.  They laugh out loud funny because he's just so, he just seems like somebody's angry dad. 
[02:08:30]  Like, you'd just be like, all right, dad, yeah, go fuck yourself.  I'm sleeping over at my friend's house.  A kid would walk away from that guy.  Yet, he almost took over the world.  So, I was doing the bit in Finland and I didn't realize that Finland had sided with them.  But, I give Finland a pass because they were basically, on the eastern front, had Stalin  and on the west, they had, southwest, they had Hitler.  So, it's basically.  You're in a bad spot.  Yeah, you're basically in between two of the biggest psychos in history simultaneously 
[02:09:00]  and you've got to flip a coin.  If you look at the cars the Germans, yeah, the cars the Germans make, Russians, what, they  drink vodka and they get them in their stashes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think they made the right choice.  And then they ended up, then they actually fought off the fucking Russians, but still  at the end of the war, had to give up a city as part of their payment because they sided  with the wrong guy.  The World War II is fucking, is so hilarious when you see some of these dictators, like  the ego trips are on.  If you ever watch like a Mussolini video, you don't know what he's saying, but that guy 
[02:09:30]  is so full of himself.  Yeah.  And he does that shit.  He just looks full when he crosses his arms, puts his nose up like, mm-hmm.  And his lower lip comes out like Tony Clifton, and he's just sitting there nodding like that.  And he's just like, at the top, and at the beginning, he almost went with the allies.  And the last second, he's like, ah.  Dude, it's like betting that one o'clock game at like 1258.  Chargers or KC?  Who are we going here?  Fuck that fucking Philip Rivers.  Is he going to do that?  Fuck it.  Let's go with the Chargers.  And then, dude, so he's on top of the world. 
[02:10:00]  You know, he's got pussies, he's got all these bitches, and all this fucking money.  Within two years, he's hanging upside down outside a gas station.  Yeah, and they're kicking him in the face.  He's dead.  And it's just fucking over, so.  That is, but that must be weird, though.  It's a whole different take, being over there, where, you know, countries, I guess, still  have that thing where they were bombed by these people, so.  Yeah.  Like, they have a different take on it.  But there's no one alive that was, for the most part, during that.  Yeah, but there's underlying shit, like, with Sweden, they weren't shit before World 
[02:10:30]  War II, but they remained neutral.  That was their big move.  Yeah.  So they never got bombed.  So just by not being leveled, they became an economic power.  But they basically sold out Norway.  They said, Hitler, hey, man, seem like you're really believing in that stuff.  We're just going to step aside, look the other way as your troops go into, they totally  sold out the Norwegians.  Oh, they let them march through their country.  Yeah.  They were neutral, but they kind of.  So there's definitely some feelings there.  Okay.  So there's a little bit dirt between the countries. 
[02:11:00]  No, it's hilarious.  All this shit, just like hanging out, talking to people.  I guess Norway got their freedom from Sweden in 1905, and then they didn't have shit.  Sweden went up after World War II, so Norway was in such a bad way.  They go, we'll give you a third of the country back or something if you give us 50% of Volvo.  Sweden said, go fuck yourself.  And then like five years later, like the Beverly Hillbillies, Norway finds all this oil underneath.  And now it's like the most expensive place to live.  And all the 7-Eleven jobs, the Swedes do. 
[02:11:30]  They come over the border.  Oh, now the roles reversed.  Yeah.  Some Swedish guys go, we are basically the Mexicans.  That's fucking hilarious.  Wow.  That's about all I learned.  I learned.  The people look good.  Dude, they're fucking.  Beautiful people over there.  And nine feet tall.  The amount of 11-year-olds that were like five foot six.  Voices hadn't even changed yet.  That's got to touch our ass.  They're like looking you in the eye. 
[02:12:00]  It's fucking ridiculous.  But after a while, there's so many like blonde, blue-eyed, good-looking people.  They've almost become background.  Like all of a sudden, you'll see a brunette.  You're like, holy shit.  Like just something different.  Like something different.  I felt like a fucking mongoloid over there.  Why are you just like a fucking?  I'm just like, Jesus Christ.  Piece of shit.  I am a chewed-eared fucking mutt over here.  But it was a great time.  How they know you over there?  They didn't. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, fuck.  And you could tell that by the ticket sale.  Are you shitting me?  What's that?  What is that?  Are those Scandinavian or Swedish chicks?  We're looking at pictures of Swedish chicks in bikinis.  But the thing is, is you're really getting blown away by their bodies.  But if you look at their face, there's a lot of sixes in there.  It's just that the blonde hair over here is so...  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.  It's the big blonde hair thing and just...  Look at that one on the bottom.  She looks like a mom.  Is that the mother of those three?  Yeah, that probably is.  Probably is, and then she would still be hot.  The mom and the daughters.  There's just something nice about a six-foot fucking Nordic blonde. 
[02:13:00]  There's just something fucking beautiful about that.  Jimmy, I'm telling you, they're there to be had.  Why not have sex with a giant woman?  Just don't go over there, Jim.  I don't do Europe.  No?  No.  Why not?  You should do Europe.  They hate Americans.  They don't.  They don't.  They won't like me.  Really?  They won't like me.  No, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  Let's build up his self-esteem.  No, no, I don't mean from...  In England, they really like you.  As much as they don't like us in the back of their heads, they realize how much cool  shit they stole from us, so they still kind of like you.  But England, I'd be often going to England, but I won't go to England. 
[02:13:30]  All you got to say when they give you shit is you just go, do you really think I determine  our foreign policy, you fucking moron?  I don't even want to do that.  It's just that they annoy me.  Honestly, yeah.  Have you gone out?  No.  I have not.  I've heard enough stories from people, and the guys that they like are good comedians.  But this guy just got that.  Yeah, I've been in enough bars where somebody from Hackensack told me what...  I'm telling you, dude.  Go over there.  No comedians, I mean, that went over there.  They're like great troops.  They're not going to like me. 
[02:14:00]  I'm not a fucking...  I'm not going to go over there and go, oh, the U.S. is stupid.  Americans are stupid, because that's what they think.  No, dude, I was over there trashing them.  So sick of you guys acting like you're better than us.  You get just as fucking dumb as we are.  You're not as fat as us, but you're definitely mushy with your fish-and-chipped torsos.  They died laughing.  They don't.  Jim, you're going to go over there.  You're going to have an accent.  You're going to have an accent.  Instantly going to be mysterious, Jim.  For the first time in your life, you're going to be mysterious.  I just don't.  They're going to find you as interesting as you find yourself, Jim. 
[02:14:30]  I don't fucking want to go to Europe.  Fuck them.  Holy shit.  Fuck Europe.  Let's go to Europe.  Fuck them.  I hate the whole fucking region.  I hate the resentment they have.  We got fans over there.  And as soon as the fucking Soviet Union fell, the whole fucking thing, they put together  the euro, they start shitting on the states.  Anthony, how bad do you want to go now?  All of a sudden, where our foreign policy is terrible.  Fuck them.  I do like the mysterious thing.  Fuck another hard rock cafe gig.  Let's go to Europe with Jim Norton.  Jim, you know how great that would be?  I've turned down every offer.  Come on, let's do this.  Jim, I swear to God.  Jim, they're just like you.  Let's do this.  They're just like you.  They're trying to get a sandwich.  They want to get blown. 
[02:15:00]  You know, most of them don't pay attention to fucking politics.  People are over...  Where's a safe place for Jimmy to go just to try it out?  Australia?  I'd like to try it out.  Beirut?  Beirut would be a good one to start.  London?  Is that safe or no?  Yeah, it's fine.  Like, they don't...  Jimmy, we got to do this.  I have no desire.  Just to experience it.  I literally don't care.  It's not to be...  I'm sure they'd be okay.  You know what?  They hurt his feelings, and Europe needs to send Jimmy an apology.  Never.  I have no desire to entertain them.  I don't find them interesting.  I don't care about going.  I'm not saying it's bad to go, but I've never really cared about going. 
[02:15:30]  Paris, Jim?  For what?  No.  I understand they have a great culture.  It makes him angry, though.  Not only does he not want to go, it just makes him angry.  You know what I want to do?  I want to get Rosetta Stone French and become just totally fluent in that accent, in that language.  Completely understand it.  And then go to Paris and act like the biggest fucking moron American.  Oh, and get one of them croissants.  And see what they say.  And just listen to what they say.  That would be hilarious to do.  And then you videotape it. 
[02:16:00]  You videotape it, and then you just write the translations of what everybody's saying.  What they're saying about you.  Wow, that's a great idea.  It's a lot of work for a bit.  It is a lot of work.  Just bring a friend.  No, but I always want to learn to speak another language, and I failed it three years in a row.  Which one?  Spanish, probably?  No, French.  That's hard.  You went French.  I went French.  Languages are hard.  That's hard in high school.  A lot of people are smarter than me.  No, no, no, no.  That was the language to learn when it was El Tabolo.  Right.  Dirty Spanish.  I took two years of French forced by my mother because she thought it was more intellectual, 
[02:16:30]  and I regret not taking Spanish.  Well, my point, everyone went Spanish because it was easier.  How the fuck do you learn a whole language as a baby, and then you can't fucking learn a language when you grow up?  It's beyond me.  That part of your brain shuts off.  Right.  That's fucking stupid.  No, it's not.  You don't need it.  Well, go yell at God.  I know.  I am.  You know what?  Right now.  And that's on a list.  Believe me.  Of things to yell at God about.  Lopero es gris y blanco.  That's all I got out of fucking...  Me and Jimmy share a maid, and her English is broken. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, I bet you do.  She's good, though.  Tag team.  And she just talks to my son in Spanish the entire time she's there, and I'm like, fuck  yeah.  I hope he's soaking some of this shit in, because he's not going to be able to learn it.  You're right, Ed.  At 14, 15, it's over, Johnny.  Then you become an idiot when it comes to languages.  Right.  How dumb is our generation?  Just your reaction to that.  I thought you'd be, oh, this would be great.  He'll become bilingual.  And his reaction is, fuck yeah.  Hopefully he soaks in some of this shit.  For what? 
[02:17:30]  I don't know.  Because in the end, did we really need another language?  No.  We're becoming old.  We don't understand it.  I took six years.  I suck at speaking Spanish.  I can't even put a sentence together.  No, dude.  You go over there, and you pick it up, just because you have to.  Yeah, but what?  All right.  Do you think, like, if you went to another country and lived there for six months, you'd  be able to communicate pretty well?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Just because you have to.  Don't you need, like, the code?  Don't you need the fucking key to the code? 
[02:18:00]  Isn't it hard?  I think certain languages absolutely, too.  I'm telling you, if you lived over there, and you actually tried to do it, that'd be  like, dude, do you think if in six months, if you worked out every day, that you'd see  some results?  You would.  I'm not saying you'd be over there going, flying around, but yeah.  All you have to do is pick up on some key words here and there.  That's all.  Yeah, but I don't know.  You don't have to, like, speak it fluently to get by.  I'd love to.  I think Japan would be tough, though.  Go to Japan.  Speak Japanese? 
[02:18:30]  Fuck that.  I don't know.  That's a whole other animal.  That's where I disagree with Bill Burr.  This is what you do.  You get some barely legal Puerto Rican girl.  All right.  Kill two birds with one stone.  Yeah.  Okay?  You have a good time with her.  Sure.  And the only way you can get laid is if you talk her into bed in Spanish.  You start with that.  So now you're talking about some kind of incentive.  Some motivation.  The proverbial carrot dangling in front of me.  Anthony would never have sex with a Puerto Rican girl, so.  Ah, no, there are a few.  Yes, he would.  You would.  There are a few I would.  Like who?  Not like crazy, not fucking, you know.  Point one out.  Oh, let me tell you.  Not like that. 
[02:19:00]  Not Rosie Perez.  You got one, though, in mind?  Should I fuck Rosie Perez?  Not.  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I think Anthony's heart's going to melt as he gets older.  You think?  I'm softening up a little bit.  Just like the Grinch.  Just like the Grinch.  His heart's going to grow a few more sizes.  And I'm going to smile and curl at the edges.  Show us a Puerto Rican you'd have sex with.  He's going to give away all his money like Carnegie at the end of his life?  Let me see if the, um, let me see if, uh, pals of the people.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Of course.  She's a pretty.  Yeah, of course.  She's a doll.  That's a doll right there.  Yeah, she's very pretty, that girl. 
[02:19:30]  I don't know who that is.  No, but Rosie Perez is not.  Would you friend her?  She just popped her up on Facebook or something.  Uh, no, Rosie Perez has just got that annoying voice and everything that goes along with it.  She's too ghetto.  Yeah, yeah.  A little too ghetto for you.  A little too ghetto.  Is this my daddy left when I was young dot com?  This is these poor girls.  What are they doing?  What are they doing to their lives?  What baggage they have.  Does that upset you, Bill, when you see girls that, uh, are scantily clad knowing that their upbringing was probably not stellar? 
[02:20:00]  No, because I still look at them.  You're still exploiting it.  And abuse the photos.  Yeah, absolutely.  But only now that I've gotten older, I just start thinking, like, that was somebody's daughter.  That's, in the last couple years, that actually creeped in.  Isn't that odd how that changes as you get a little older?  You start thinking things like that, and you want to smack yourself in the head for it.  Dude, like, I remember when, well, what's-his-face Fishburne was going through the whole thing.  I went on the radio.  And somebody was going, yeah, what do you think about that?  I was like, I think it's fucking horrible.  As a father, you know, that guy is a father.  You're not even a dad, but you would understand how horrible that would be. 
[02:20:30]  We had her on, right?  No.  No, we never had her on, did we?  We should have.  Yeah, we did.  I didn't feel bad bringing her on.  Wait, did we?  We had Fishburne's daughter on?  On the phone?  Iraq.  She made me a phoner.  Yeah, I think we had a phoner with her.  We had her on.  Who was in that day?  Really?  We felt so fucking sorry for her.  You know what it is about these girls is when they dress up like that, they actually think  that they're pretty, and that that's what people are thinking.  Right.  And then, 20 minutes later, you're cocky all over their face, and no one's talking to  them as they're silently toweling themselves off. 
[02:21:00]  Look at this girl.  Look at her in her face.  You can see it in her face.  Oh yeah, there's some there.  Well, look at the fucking big orb tits and everything.  She looks great.  I ain't fucking...  Those snow globes they put in there?  Fucking great, yeah.  You're a fan of the snow globes, Bill?  No.  I'd say the best fake titties I've seen is in Dallas, Texas.  They got the whole teardrop thing down, but I don't understand how you can put a bag  of plastic chemicals in your body, and your immune system accepts it.  Doesn't just try to eat it?  Yeah, it doesn't just immediately... 
[02:21:30]  I guess because it's so sterilized.  What?  Maybe?  Something in your body that shouldn't be there.  You're right.  Look at that girl.  She probably wanted to be in an architect.  She looks too ghetto.  She's like ghetto, that chick.  That's nothing for...  You know what?  She's probably blown people on more continents than you've been states.  You're right.  I fucking wouldn't doubt it.  Oh, man.  What about that, Ed?  Yeah, that's all right.  She's Spanish?  She's got a big ace?  I know, but look at her smiling.  Like, she should be ashamed.  She's actually smiling.  She's got to. 
[02:22:00]  Here it is.  She's hiding the tears.  Am I a princess?  Look how pretty I am.  Yeah.  Look at that picture of that guy getting paddled with a lightsaber.  Jesus.  There's no dignity.  No dignity whatsoever there.  I don't press play.  I didn't know it was a video.  Fucking shit.  There's a good girl.  Go up a little bit.  That's a good girl.  Oh, over there?  Oh, I thought she had cum on her face.  She's moments away from that, Jim.  Yeah.  From the looks of the picture.  Yeah, so, yeah, Hispanic girl. 
[02:22:30]  I guess that's what we were getting at.  Fair enough.  Occasionally.  I like them.  Yeah, that's a goal in my life, which probably won't come true, is I want to learn to speak  another language.  Yeah.  And I can't, just to have the date, the moment when someone talks shit about me, and you  know what they're saying, I can say, just for your information, not all Americans  are stupid.  Yeah.  Just so I have that dumb, dramatic moment, except I say it in their language.  That was always good in, what was that, in Braveheart, I guess, when they started bad  mouthing him in fucking Latin, and he just started, blah, blah, blah, blah, like rambling 
[02:23:00]  Latin back at him, like, go fuck yourself.  You would think I'm a savage, but I know some shit.  And that only happens in your dreams and in movies.  And in movies.  But in reality, they will talk shit about me for the rest of my life.  And you'll just be smiling and nodding.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I worked for Christoph Silver, there was German ladies that worked at the store in the  city, and there was somebody ordering candlesticks, and he was being annoying, and they just  kept saying to each other, I think he wants to take these home and stick them up his ass.  And the guy then spoke to them in German. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, shit.  Which was a great moment, I think, to fucking know German.  It's a whole story.  No, it's good.  It's the only example I have.  I like it.  But you wouldn't do that if you, like, the power, that's what I love, too, is it's like  you immediately have this secret code.  If you can speak a language with another friend that nobody knows.  Just imagine being in an elevator, and you could speak a language that nobody understood.  Whatever the fuck you want, right.  You'd be like, look at this cunt.  That is annoying, but you always have that thing where you don't know if the person does  understand what you're saying.  You know? 
[02:24:00]  You're in an elevator, and you're like, look at this fucking bitch.  And then you don't know if she's going to turn around and start, you know.  Eh, most cases, you just start off nice.  No, most cases, but it's not 100%.  Yeah, true.  You start off nice.  Yeah, you feel it out a little bit.  You just say, I really like your tie, sir.  And when he doesn't turn around, look at this fucking ass.  Yeah, people that are going to do that, they've got it figured out.  Got to start slow.  So we're not going to get Jimmy to Europe?  No, that ain't going to happen.  Come on, Jimmy.  No desire.  Come on, look, he's got a shaved head and a kiss t-shirt on.  You're lucky to get him out of New Jersey.  No desire to go to East.  I don't find them sophisticated. 
[02:24:30]  For the show.  They're not interesting.  Let's do it for the show.  He sounds very defensive.  No, I just don't like them.  I think secretly he wants to be liked by them.  You're incorrect.  Jimmy, they would accept you with open arms.  Maybe they would.  You know how many ONA fans, by the way, were over there?  That's fucked up.  I'm fucking ridiculous.  That's crazy.  Dude, I had one show.  Where the hell was I?  It was such a...  I want to say when I was in Stockholm, Sweden, like five people came up with WOW t-shirts  on.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  That's so fucked up.  I get emails from England and stuff like that.  And they go and tell Jimmy to come over, tell all the ONA guys. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, fuck them.  Let them come here to watch a show.  Why do I have to go to them?  I'm the celebrity entertainer.  Ozzy doesn't come to my living room and do gigs.  I show up where he is.  But why are you getting angry about it?  I'm not angry.  But he comes to your state.  He travels Europe.  He does, but he's British.  Musicians are different.  He goes to South America.  Musicians are different.  If I thought I would do well there or draw there...  You know, Jimmy, I think we're all human beings.  You're absolutely right.  And I like the human beings.  I'm more comfortable in the States. 
[02:25:30]  I don't even go to Canada.  I think Montreal is the most overrated place to do comedy in history.  It's a nice city.  It's fun.  It's a beautiful city.  It's average.  And I do okay there, but I don't do particularly great there.  It's more than average.  Average.  Really?  Yes.  You walked around?  Yeah, of course I did.  Old city?  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah, I did, actually.  I was there twice at one...  It's pretty much split in half.  You got the old Montreal and the new Montreal.  Yeah, yeah.  It was actually very pretty.  That is weird.  It just looks like...  It looks like a 60s.  Everything looks like America did back a few years ago. 
[02:26:00]  Well, that's Toronto.  Toronto is just weird.  It's like a time machine.  Horrific traffic there.  Montreal, not so much.  Really?  Ugh.  Horrific traffic there.  Where?  Montreal?  No, Toronto.  I've been there in years and years.  Toronto, I would actually like to do again.  That's one place I want to go back to.  The Asians love Toronto.  Do they?  Oh, yeah.  I just want to go because snow is from there.  DJ Chanel?  Snow.  What?  I don't know who that is.  What?  The fucking...  Informa.  You know that fucking guy?  Did you used to like that song, Jimmy? 
[02:26:30]  A little bit.  Yeah.  I was younger.  When you wore your tango hat?  No, it wasn't that old.  When you were in the Lords?  No, it was way after that time.  I laughed at the other interpretation.  That snow was from there.  Oh, okay.  Which I thought was funny.  That's what I thought he was doing.  Oh, that is funny.  Ah, here we go.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  Woo!  Turn this up, man.  I wasn't trying to segue into the song.  For Jimmy, buddy.  Informa.  You know, say that I must tell me I'm a man.  I lick your bum bum, ma'am.  Take down my business.  Ma'am.  I lick your bum bum? 
[02:27:00]  This takes you right back, doesn't it?  Yeah, man.  This takes me back to when I was one of the 99%.  Those days sucked ass.  How did he get away from this?  A white guy from Toronto rapping with something?  Is this a Jamaican accent?  Yeah.  How do you do that?  Iraq, is this part of a theme?  No?  This isn't part of...  Topical?  Sex Man?  Getting topical, right?  No, is Snow 49 years old today or something? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, we do this all day.  It's just a dumb reference.  Catch it.  Yeah, it really is.  You don't remember this one?  Oh, you do remember this one?  Sometimes people like that little blast of nostalgia you get with a little audio.  Oh, do you know what?  I told people over there.  I said, yeah, I'll start coming over.  You know, every year, year and a half, I'll come over here.  And the resounding response was, why?  Oh, really?  Yeah, they act like they live in Iowa.  It's like, this is fucking beautiful over here.  And they go, all right.  Why would you come back here?  Really?  I know you like to move around in between gigs and check out the city and stuff. 
[02:28:00]  You see any cool stuff?  Well, it was such a thrash because it was like five different cities in seven days.  And I was going in to their morning shows.  How's that?  It's a fucking trip, man.  It's kind of weird.  I just find you to teach it how to build bird.  It's hard to go to keep it.  And it's like, oh, my God.  Yeah, and then people open for you.  And they're totally speaking, you know, Norwegian or something.  And everybody's laughing.  And then you just walk out.  And you're just like, hey, how's it going?  They just switch over. 
[02:28:30]  Holy shit, that's fucking weird.  A whole audience of people that can speak two languages.  It's crazy.  Yeah, it blows my mind.  But I only had one guy who was a dick when I was in Copenhagen.  Ah, Copenhagen.  I was going, I can't, I can't, I always forget.  I go, does it go Norway, Sweden, Finland, or Finland, Sweden, Norway?  And then he turns out, oh, it's the Americans.  You're so stupid with the geography.  Literally said it.  And then it was funny because he didn't commit to it.  He's like, and then he, like, he said, and then he tried to, like, laugh with me. 
[02:29:00]  It's like, no, you were being a douche.  And I go, ah, I fucking trashed that guy.  I go, really?  I go, where the fuck is?  Where's fucking, where's South Dakota, bitch?  I go, where's Missouri in relation to Tennessee?  He goes, I don't know.  Really?  Yeah?  I'm so fucking stupid.  Did you go to medical school to be a cab driver?  Go fuck yourself.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Go fuck yourself.  Did the audience enjoy that?  No, this was in a cab.  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  This was in a cab.  I thought it was an audience member.  We trashed that guy.  Dude, I was pissed because he was such, it wasn't that he said it, it's that he tried  to laugh it off.  Right. 
[02:29:30]  You Americans are so stupid with a judge.  And he goes, I'm just kidding after I said it.  You're so stupid.  As I yelled at him, he sat there and just stared at the windshield with that same stupid  cheesy smile on his face, like, completely uncomfortable.  Good for you.  That was him naked.  To me, that's the whole continent, is that fucking guy.  No, it isn't.  That's why we gotta go, Jimmy.  No, because I went there, and this is the worst story I could have told with Jim Norton here.  That guy was just honest.  He was the only honest one over there.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  That guy was the only honest one.  That's how they all look at us.  He sounds like a scared old lady. 
[02:30:00]  But I'm not so...  I'm not going over there.  They don't like us.  I don't think it's brave.  I don't know what's gonna happen.  It's not scared.  It's not an act of bravery.  What if the plane falls in the ocean?  I just don't think it's fucking cultural.  I don't want to see them.  It's not a fear thing.  It's not a matter of, I'm not brave enough to face them.  I want to know what this is about.  It seems like there's something else going on here.  He's so adamantly...  Yeah.  It angers you, Jimmy.  No, it doesn't.  I think it's by experience of seeing what happens around the world as far as, you know... 
[02:30:30]  Jim, stop slow.  Go to Greenland.  And then we'll work our way up at Iceland.  You'll see.  You'll have an accent.  You will be mysterious, Jimmy.  I have no desire to be there.  I don't care about them.  I don't care about entertaining them.  What about Australia?  That one, Australia, I kind of want to go to.  You want to go there?  Yes, I do.  What about Spain?  Never thought about it or resisted.  All right, this is what I was told.  Don't go south of Berlin.  When you go down to Munich, their comedy is they want to see some girl's titty pop out  or slip on a banana peel.  They are in the stone ages when it comes to comedy. 
[02:31:00]  Really?  No, because some people flew in...  Because, dude, it's like a southwest flight.  Everything over there is a southwest flight.  And you're in a completely different culture, language, and all that.  Because, obviously, back in the day, everyone was riding around on a fucking yak, and they  just developed their cultures, right?  So, like, I had people, like, flew in from, like, Romania, which was hilarious, because  I had a joke that I made a reference to Transylvania, and I learned that that's where Transylvania is.  I didn't even know it existed.  I thought it was a fake place. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I thought it was, like, one of those Boris Karloff made-up cities.  And they came from Romania, they got wet Transylvanias, and I was such a moron American.  Oh, there, that place really exists!  And then you see it in their eyes, like, whatever they thought of you goes down, like, four notches.  All of a sudden, you're just that dumb American.  Dude, there's another moron American moment.  I was on stage last night in Stockholm, Sweden, and I came walking out.  Spinal Tap moment.  I go, hey, it's great to be back here in Switzerland.  Oh, shit.  And they all go, laughing, and I wasn't joking. 
[02:32:00]  I fucked it up.  I was like an American, typical American.  They both start with SW, they're both in Europe.  Oh, man, you pulled it off, though.  I totally played it off, and when I told Nia afterwards, she goes, yeah, I thought you  did that on purpose.  I went, no, I didn't, shit.  I didn't.  I was dead serious.  She got away with one, man.  Hey, use it every time now that you go back here.  Good for you.  Fucking good.  Yeah, so, I think that's about all I learned.  Holy shit.  Other than that Swedes look down on people from Finland, and people from Finland think 
[02:32:30]  people from Sweden are gay.  They're gay?  Because the way they talk, the way they kind of sing it.  They don't like that?  I guess.  I can't tell the difference.  It all sounds the fucking same to me over there.  But, uh...  Tom...  And that is it.  Tom on Long Island, is this worth doing?  He says, can Bill tell the Joe DeRosa story about him waking him up?  Oh, I can tell that story.  Is it good?  The hardest...  I don't know.  That's a tough one.  It's like, all right, I'll give it a whirl.  The hardest I've laughed at 7.50 in the morning without having stayed up all night. 
[02:33:00]  I came...  Like, I was staying in this place the first night.  I crashed there.  And, uh...  He went into the bedroom.  I'm sleeping on the couch.  He's got the door closed.  He's got the air conditioner cranked or whatever.  So I guess he didn't hear me coming, and he was sound asleep.  And he forgot that I was there.  Oh, shit.  So I opened the door, and he fucking freaks out, but only from the waist down.  His toe...  From up...  Waist up, he's totally paralyzed.  And his feet just start kicking like he's doing the backstroke, trying to set a record. 
[02:33:30]  He just goes...  They just start...  And they hear the cheeks going...  Dude, I fucking...  I thought he was going to have a heart attack.  I fucking bursted out laughing.  Dude, you know when you wake up, everything's tight?  Like, my abs still hurt from how fucking hard I laughed.  And then he tried...  He must have been so pissed that you were laughing at him.  No, he tried to play it off.  He just goes...  Jesus Christ.  And I just started giving him a shit.  I go, that's what you got?  That's all you got?  If an axe murderer comes in, that's what you're going to do? 
[02:34:00]  You're going to start flapping your fucking feet around?  Do you know how funny that puke sound is when it hits the fucking garbage bag?  Dude, if you had the sound of his feet kicking under those fucking feet...  Dude, it was a blur.  He opened his eyes and all he did...  Like a bitch.  His fight or flight was his feet.  We're just going to do the fucking flipper move.  He might as well...  Yeah, his body probably just reacted like he was standing up and wanted to run. 
[02:34:30]  I think that's what he did.  Yeah, he was running.  Just imagine.  It wasn't even the full brain.  It was just the brainstem sending a signal to the legs to just run away.  He was in full flight mode, lying down, and he couldn't figure out why he wasn't getting  any traction.  Jesus.  Oh, shit.  So there you go.  Anytime you can trash DeRosa, it's worth it.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you would be mysterious over there.  Never happening, brother.  I have no desire to go.  Just to see Jimmy climbing on top of one of those nine-foot Scandinavian women, then they 
[02:35:00]  would be thrilled.  Really, yeah.  I love your brown hair.  I just...  I don't fucking have a desire to be there.  It's not that I think, oh, God, they're so...  Oh, they're not going to love me.  I don't think they would like me, but I've been bombed in New York.  The world needs you and your comedy.  They don't.  They don't.  At all.  And they fucking...  As a group, I think that Europeans...  As a group, they've been cunts in the last fucking 40 years, the way they look at the 
[02:35:30]  U.S., fuck them.  I just don't want to go.  And maybe that's me being ignorant, but that's the way I feel.  Other comics go and do very well.  Great.  I mean, I don't knock it.  It's just not for me.  It's a two-way street.  It's a two-way street, and everybody is defined by the biggest morons.  We're defined by those people who go over there, speak English!  What the fuck?  Right?  We're defined by those guys, and we define them by that one douche.  I almost judged all of Denmark because of one asshole cab driver, and I'm like, this is  ridiculous.  And I showed up, everybody was psyched, and the hundred people that came out were psyched 
[02:36:00]  that I was there, and I'm like, this is the moron self-sabotage move, where I'm going  to now just look at everybody here like they're that fucking cab driver.  I ended up having a great show, Jimmy, and they thought I was mysterious.  Bill's so open-minded.  Yeah, he really is.  It's just not for me.  I like having a fucking steel trap closed mind.  No, no, no.  It's so handy.  I'm open-minded when it helps me.  Yeah?  If it doesn't help me.  I don't walk down the street at night going, everything is beautiful.  Yeah.  I used to do a bit how everybody's racist at night, and you have to be. 
[02:36:30]  In order to get home, you have to think the worst of people in order to get home safely.  That is your job.  You're on the Serengeti there, you know?  You don't know.  Yeah, it's basically past, once the sun goes down.  Yeah.  Jimmy, there's another hip-hop song probably from your back in the day.  Creeps come out at night, right?  Houdini.  Let's do some Houdini.  Strangers.  No, it's the freaks come out at night.  Oh, all right.  The freaks come out at night.  I listen to hair metal.  I have no idea.  I did, too.  But I like the little fucking, the little Houdini and Jalil. 
[02:37:00]  Speaking of hair metal and music, Ace Frehley?  And 930, yeah.  930?  How cool is that?  Very.  Jimmy Guest Day, they've been calling it.  Good.  We like having Jimmy Guest.  The second one of the week.  Jimmy gets very excited.  Yes, I do.  And it's fun.  Fun to watch.  Yeah, but his interview skills are, remember back in the day when he used to, those stuttering  ones he did?  Oh, God.  Hilarious.  I know.  Now he just, yeah.  Like, compares questions.  That quote used to kill me when he started to ask that question.  Zach Wilde.  About the dress.  Realized he fucked up and then tried to repeat it again and just. 
[02:37:30]  Dress.  Something about a dress.  It was a dress.  We have it.  We have it.  Fucking great.  Yeah, that was perfect.  That was so good.  E-Rock, run down the hall and get that.  Oh, cool.  I get to watch the water go like in Jurassic Park.  The whole building.  Good one.  Houdini just doesn't hold up.  No.  No, man.  Oh, this is old school.  It looks like Cool Herc.  The asshole rose, bicep, shorts he is on. 
[02:38:00]  Rappers were very non-threatening back then.  This was a massive hit.  Like, you just watch this and it was like, oh, okay.  But then once NWA came out and shit, all bets were off.  Look at those shorts.  This is from the Freddie Mercury collection.  Oh, God.  What year is this?  I'm going to guess 85.  That's my guess.  Wow, I'd say 83.  You know what I love about that?  That shit was so new back then.  There was like no sort of through line with what they were wearing.  It's just so you got anything that would look good on stage. 
[02:38:30]  That is just a leather clusterfuck.  One of them has the delirious suit on.  You see that guy?  Doing the Eddie Murphy.  Yeah, the red leather suit.  Grab that from Eddie.  84.  We need that.  Oh, 84.  We're both wrong with that.  84.  We split the difference.  That's still a good song.  You like that one?  Yeah.  I don't know.  84.  I like the chorus.  I don't like the lyric structure, but the chorus is good.  You're talking 27 years ago.  I want to hear some of that. 
[02:39:00]  What the fuck got?  This is when fucking hip-hop and rap changed for your pal Anthony.  I couldn't get into it with that fucking pussy shit.  But now when N.W.A. fucking hit, oh, was I fucking into it.  It was hilarious.  Look at his shit.  Hopefully you can relate to EZ.  Look at his shit.  Yeah.  Relate to EZ.  That's an age joke.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  Now, what year is this?  This is late 80s, right? 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah.  80, 80.  80, 90.  You know what would be funny with this is during Ice Cube's verse here is you intercut it with  him being mad at that Coors Light bottle.  Yeah, yeah.  Dude, this fucking business gets everybody after a while.  And his fucking movies where he's driving his daughter to fucking school or some shit.  Yeah, but that makes sense.  He's an angry young man here.  It's just like a stand-up comedian.  I'll be wearing a sweater soon.  Talking about cutting the grass.  That's why someone like EZ, he's now a legend, you know? 
[02:40:00]  He would have been like EZ.  He would have been like, yeah, man, use Old Spice, motherfucker.  He would have been in that family movie.  Yeah.  Knocking niggas out the box.  Yeah.  This was the shit that was just fucking funny to me.  Everyone got so serious about like, oh, you know, disrespecting this, singing about  the police and the...  It's like, it's fucking hilarious. 
[02:40:30]  Shit's great.  It's kind of tame.  Straight out of Compton.  A little tame.  Yeah.  Cheesy track.  Dope man, dope man.  That shit and fucking...  What was that other band with that guy with one eye?  It was another fucking combo.  Slick Rick and Dougie Fresh.  No, no.  I think they were out of fucking Texas or some shit.  Ah.  Easy, he did some shit with them.  That was Warren.  No.  NWA, EZ, Ghetto Boys.  Thank you.  Was it Loudness?  Thank you, Hee Haw, Ghetto Boys.  Was it Loudness?  No, it wasn't Loudness. 
[02:41:00]  Ghetto Boys.  Ghetto Boys.  Ghetto Boys.  Ghetto Boys.  We got Jimmy's interview.  Shit ruled.  Was that Crocus?  No, it wasn't Crocus.  That's what you were listening to, right?  Well, that's why we ran and got Jimmy's interview about the dress.  We haven't played this in a while.  Want to just play it into break?  Bill, what are you promoting there, sir?  I got nothing.  Bill, we're on Twitter.  I just came in because I like you guys.  Good.  I'm trying to get...  I'm starting to get Jimmy to your foundation.  Never going to happen.  You know why?  First of all, they don't fly you and put you... 
[02:41:30]  In England, a lot of times, it's supposed to be a great club, the comedy store, but it's  like you got to get yourself over there.  And I'm not big enough where...  I saw Chris Rock at the cellar one night.  He's like, dude, you got to go over there, do all the press.  But it's like he forgets, like, dude, you're Chris Rock, but you're going to do the O2  arena two nights in a row.  So for you, it's a tremendous place where they already know you, but for me, it's not.  So why would I do that?  I mean, if you have a desire like Australia, I wouldn't draw in, but I want to go to Australia,  so I would go there. 
[02:42:00]  But I have no desire to see Europe.  I have none.  New Zealand?  I would like to...  I'd rather go there just to see what fucking O2 Warriors were filmed.  Yeah.  Morocco?  No.  No?  Morocco?  No.  No.  No Islamic countries?  No.  And fucking my manager can't get enough.  Islamabad, he loves it.  He's crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes to Afghanistan on Afghan Airlines.  He's still going to have that dumb look on his face when his head's cut off.  I told him just...  Oh, everyone looks stupid.  Just travel with an orange jumpsuit, you fucking idiot.  I was just going to say that.  I was just going to say that's how I view countries.  Certain countries, I just have an orange jumpsuit painted on it. 
[02:42:30]  I was like, I'm not going there.  No.  I'm not going there.  You watch that show, Locked Up Abroad, and you're just like, oh my god, that could be  the worst fucking...  That makes you never want to trip.  Yeah, yeah.  And there, I got to tell you something.  Even being over in Europe, there is something unsettling to not be with your tribe.  See, right.  You're outside of your fucking tribe.  I got to find the embassy, which is like, I'm on base.  I'm on base.  You can't touch me.  I'm on base.  Like the stoop when you're fucking playing hide-and-seek.  I'm on base.  Yeah, no.  It's just, there is something really... 
[02:43:00]  And, dude, you want to talk about, you know, the I can't find my wallet panic?  The I can't find my passport panic is that...  The wallet panic times like 900.  You're done.  You can't...  I came walking home one night from somewhere, and I fucking did the...  And I couldn't find...  I left it in the room.  Oh, shit.  I had like hand slap prints on my chest from all over my body from fucking checking it  like nine million times and just putting my hands in...  You know, knowing it wasn't there, still looking for the fucking thing. 
[02:43:30]  Do you...  Jonathan said he'll photocopy his passport and carry that and leave the real one like in  a safe or something.  You can get away with that?  If they hassle you somewhere, you don't have to have it on you.  Value your papers.  Really?  Yeah.  They allow you to...  I don't know if they allow you to, but the worst that could happen is...  They make you get your real one.  They make you go to the hotel and get it as opposed to losing it in a foreign country  and being robbed.  I wouldn't like to do something where it would be like, oh, that's against the law here.  Oh, I didn't know.  Well, who gives a shit?  It is Thailand.  And now you're...  Yeah.  And now you're in jail and you're like, what the fuck? 
[02:44:00]  No, no.  I don't go to those rogue, weird law countries.  Yeah, you have like one joint and you get like caned in the death  penalty nine years later.  Like, yeah, I don't go to those places.  Do you want to take the chance?  Just to know where those places are.  With his rusted out American tanks sticking out of like the river from years ago.  Colin Quinn on the line.  Colin.  Colin's back.  Sorry, guys.  I just had to read you this text I just found this morning from 6.41 a.m.  Okay.  Jim Norton.  Do you want to call in or come in this morning? 
[02:44:30]  Early, though.  We have Ace Frehley at 9.  I had this fucking night.  Fuck you.  I had this nightmare of fucking Ace walking in and this dummy with his fucking T bumbling  and going, well, Ferrell, I'm trying to talk to an icon and you're fucking sitting  over there dipping your fucking donut in T.  Colin's an icon to some people.  No, he's not.  Colin's gone.  Colin's an eyesore.  Well, we should get ready for the Ace Frehley interview. 
[02:45:00]  Yes.  Yes.  I'm going to go to break with the famous dress incident from Jim Norton.  I just fell apart.  Oh, God.  I got to hear this.  I love this.  This is old school.  Jimmy's a really good interviewer now.  I'm an average interviewer.  I think I'm a boring interviewer.  No, no.  You've come a long way, man.  You do a very good job.  All right.  More with Bill Burr, too.  You did something in a dress.  I don't know.  It was fucking, it was in Philadelphia.  I mean, Kim from YSP, who was in love with you, was telling me that you did something  in a dress.  I don't know what it was.  Did you go on stage in a dress or did you do something in public with a dress that was  really completely uncalled for and hilarious?  I don't know.  But if it was, I'm sure it was us. 
[02:45:30]  It was definitely gay.  I'm sure.  Of course.  We pulled it off.  Of course.  You know, when you got guys that are weighing about 265, 250, 245, you know, with dresses  that they're bursting out of.  No, we got to make sure the dresses are for like a 13-year-old pubescent girl.  You know what I mean?  So that's like, she hasn't even hit puberty yet, so you know.  She said you went to a mall.  You were in a mall or something like that with a dress and you had like your chain wallet.  She said it was like the most ridiculous thing you had.  That's where I was at.  Yeah, I was out in, she was in Boston or we were hanging down in Philly or something 
[02:46:00]  like that.  But yeah, it was definitely beyond gay.  It was a bunch of grown men and we made sure, you know, we went to like a Victoria's  Secret and just got the most insane.  No, where you're just, you know, I can get you in the smallest stuff that like a 13-year-old  will wear.  Oh, of course.  And you're just bursting out in these dresses and everything like that, dude.  It was awesome.  You just gave him an idea.  No, and we're...  The Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  We're back, back in the New York groove. 
[02:46:30]  We're back, back in the New York groove.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Beth, I hear you calling, but I can't come home right now. 
[02:47:00]  Cause me and the boys are doing some radio.  And I can't find the sound.  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:47:30]  Getting ready for the Ace Freely interview.  Ace got a new book out, huh?  Yes.  No regret.  It's great, dude.  You're loving it, Jimmy.  I'm very biased because I love Kiss and I love Sabbath, so I'm promoting these books.  But it's actually a fucking great book.  Must be, dude.  You've blown right through.  When did they give you that book?  A couple weeks ago, but I just got distracted at one point.  I didn't read for like five days.  So I was like, I should have been finished with these already, but I just... 
[02:48:00]  That's okay.  Don't beat yourself up.  No, no, I'm not.  But I kind of wish I was done.  You read enough of them.  I know.  I have a few pages left.  How many questions do you have for Ace?  How many pages of questions?  About three.  But again, I won't get in small font.  But I had four for Tony.  Let me see.  Small font.  Wow.  But I won't get to all these.  And I'm interviewing for the Boneyard too, so it's like you want to...  Wow.  Very good.  See, Jimmy has become all great interviewers.  They read the book.  They're prepared with their questions.  I think I'm a self-indulgent, boring interviewer. 
[02:48:30]  I really believe that.  I'm not saying that to fish for coffee.  I really do.  Self-indulgent?  Yeah, meaning I don't get good information.  Some guys can get information out of people, which is really...  It's an art to do that.  That's water boredom.  You could be more self-indulgent than me asking Tony Iommi about John Bonham's bass drum technique.  How many people...  That was a moment though.  We liked that one.  I got one email from that like, dude, I was on the edge of my seat when you asked.  And like you, I was disappointed when he didn't know. 
[02:49:00]  Out of all the stupid fucking questions.  No, you were good in that interview.  You asked him good questions.  I mean, and he likes talking about Bonham.  It was one of his best friends.  You fucking loved Bonham.  It was good.  I like how he didn't pull any punches too.  Like, you know, you would think because of the way Bonham passed that he wouldn't bring up the drinking.  He just said, oh yeah, he ordered 12 bottles of champagne.  He drank all of them.  And he was paralytic.  Paralytic.  Paralytic, he said.  Paralytic, great expressions.  Is that even a word?  Yeah, you read the book, they're blimey.  A lot of blimeys and bloody hell.  Blimey.  Blimey.  You would know these are real words, Jimmy, if you went to Europe. 
[02:49:30]  I know.  You're probably right.  That's why I'm very ignorant.  That's why you should go to Europe.  I kept saying blimey.  What if Ozzy said, I want to bring you over to Europe so these people could see your comedy.  Thanks, Oz.  Let's go.  I'm not that set against it.  You know, what if a girl wanted to blow you in Europe?  I'm on my way.  Jim, it would happen.  I'm telling you, instantly.  Mysterious.  Tell me about Zinn-Jersey.  Yeah, exactly.  It was just something like I just never wanted to do. 
[02:50:00]  I really didn't.  And this is years ago that was offered.  Do you want to go over to England?  I was like, eh.  Fuck, I'd go in a second.  That sounds cool.  I know a lot of people would.  Let's go as a show.  Even Brazil I wouldn't go back to.  It was fun to go because I went with my friends.  But it's just like being in foreign countries, Montreal I go to only for the money.  I don't hate them.  I don't hate them.  I just found it was an average city.  Nice people.  Montreal's barely a foreign country, though.  But you know what I'm saying?  Oh, it's affordable France.  It's awesome.  Beautiful women. 
[02:50:30]  But did you go to the church?  No, I go to the, they got that big park there.  You run the stairs and you look out at this beautiful city.  It's like a Rocky moment.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Some people love to travel.  Yeah, I have no, oh, you want to see something weird?  Look up the angry baby.  Oslo.  Can you do that?  If anybody can look that up.  Because we're waiting for Ace Freely.  Yeah, yeah.  Sam, Sam Roberts.  This could be good.  Hit the Google.  This guy made all these statues about going through all the different phases in life. 
[02:51:00]  You should see, there's one guy, he's like kicking babies and everybody's naked.  What?  You got to put something else in.  The angry baby, what?  Oslo.  Oslo.  Oslo.  Oh boy.  O-S-L-O-W, Sam.  No, no.  O-S-L-O.  O-S-L-O.  You forgot the E.  Yeah.  Potato.  Remember?  Let's see if I got it picked.  There it is.  This is one.  That's a statue.  It's like a stomping mad baby. 
[02:51:30]  That's a dumbass statue.  I've never been so fucking immature as I walked through that park.  I forget the name of the park, but they have all these, they got all the, everybody's  naked.  It's all these different phases of life, I guess.  There's one naked guy like in this square, like he's fighting against his destiny.  But then there's other ones, just a naked guy grabbing a woman and running away with  her, basically.  And she clearly looks like she doesn't want to be with him.  So it's like rape.  The rape phase.  The rape phase of everyone's life.  There's another one where he's like, this guy, I guess the pressure of being in a family 
[02:52:00]  is the only way I can think of it.  He's got like three babies and they sort of look like they're swooping down on him.  They're all naked.  And then he's got one he's kicking.  And the baby, it's funny, he's got his arms up like a boxer, like he's protecting his  head.  He's trying to defend himself.  Keep your guard up, kid.  So I went through that whole, through that whole part.  I'm big.  I'm big in the parks.  I go into the parks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You go.  Yeah.  You kind of explore.  Yeah.  It was interesting.  They attended tennis courts with clay courts. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, look at that.  Roland Garros.  It's fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  No, I don't do.  I don't understand why you would fly that far away and then just sit in your hotel room  and be like, yeah, can I get the cheeseburger medium rare, please?  Yeah.  French fries.  Anybody can get ketchup instead of the mayo?  Try to watch TV.  Try to watch American TV so you forget you're even over there.  I know.  What was the first city that got boring to you?  Where you, you know, you go, like you said, you travel and do the walk.  No, you know what?  I, I, I.  Well, what city you're like, all right, I've seen everything you've possibly seen. 
[02:53:00]  No city, no city over there has gotten boring.  No, I mean in general, maybe there's one in the States.  Because you do this with cities in the States as well.  Oh, let's see here.  Nashville can get a little boring.  Really?  Just because I don't have a, I never get a car when I'm there.  And anything that's cool that's going on in musically is going to be happening when I have shows.  Oh, yeah.  And so when you're not in just downtown Nashville, you just sort of, you know, it's just very like,  Dallas can get boring. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Dallas is just, it's just strip mall, strip mall, strip mall.  You know, excuse me, hiccup.  Strip mall.  I got all choked up about how much I didn't like Dallas.  How many times are you on the road that you just want to go into a fucking mall?  Like in Houston, you stay by the Galleria.  There's just nothing to do in some cities.  I like, I don't like to do much.  Yeah.  I wish I did, but I just did.  Houston actually has a mall that has an ice rink in it, which is hilarious because it's,  because it's an ice rink.  You're right near the food court.  Everybody's shoving this shit in their mouth.  A lot of fat people down there.  And then it's Houston.  So a lot of people don't know how to skate. 
[02:54:00]  I remember standing there watching this Asian dude and just, we were filming him.  Somewhere I had the film laughing our fucking asses off at this guy.  And then he did like the thing, you know, where you're starting to fall backwards and  your legs are moving like the roses in the bed.  He fell and he cracked his head on the ice.  It wasn't moving.  Holy shit.  It wasn't funny.  And immediately stopped being funny.  It was just like, all right, dude, come on, man.  That was tragic.  Get up, man.  Get up.  Come on.  Please get up.  Please.  Don't make me have had laughed at you.  I don't want a nightmare over you.  You know, I don't do a lot of shit.  I do more just like sporting events. 
[02:54:30]  I go to sporting events.  That's how I book the road.  Oh, really?  Especially if it's a city I fucking don't want to go to.  It's just like, are the royals in town?  What's going on?  Do you watch the whole game or do you just go for a few minutes or an hour or whatever?  No, no.  I always go for the whole game.  I used to be, when I used to do college gigs by myself, just so I would actually, I was  the guy who kept score.  I would do that.  No, no.  No, because you felt like a, because I was clearly by myself.  It's almost like, you know, when you start looking at your cell phone and you know nobody's 
[02:55:00]  calling you.  That's the baseball version is you just sit there by yourself, like keeping score.  Doing the stats.  Yeah.  There's another K.  I stopped short of having the AM radio with the antenna up.  Radio hat.  Radio hat.  But no, man, I went to.  I never got that where people like wrote down the stats.  What do you do with it?  What do you do with it?  No, because you're able to follow the game way more because you know what the guy did  the last time.  You can tell basically how many times people have gotten up.  You can get way more of a feel for the game as opposed to just being hammered, yelling 
[02:55:30]  at colors.  Well, yeah.  He's got the other team.  Fuck you.  Oh, colors.  You know what the best one, though, the best fan out there, I think, is do you guys ever  see that guy that goes to the Devil Ray games?  The Devil Ray games, there's a guy down there and each game he picks one guy to heckle on  the other team.  And I've talked to a guy.  I talked to a guy in the Giants about this.  You just think, oh, God, please don't pick me.  Please don't. 
[02:56:00]  I noticed one time when Johnny Damon was still on the Red Sox every time he wouldn't say  shit.  Ortiz comes up, doesn't say anything, whoever the hell else was on the team at the time.  Manny doesn't say anything.  And all of a sudden, Damon comes up and he goes, oh, Johnny!  Let's go, Johnny!  Woo!  Johnny Damon!  He just yells his name as loud as you possibly can.  Dude, I'm sitting at home hearing every word of it. 
[02:56:30]  And that's what makes it so unsettling.  That's hilarious.  Is there's that tension as you walk up like, is it going to be me?  Is he going to pick me?  And you know his teammates are all laughing.  That it's them.  Yeah, because it's him.  And you don't have to deal with it.  And you get up there.  And you know what he's making out and you come back and he's like, ah, that motherfucker  picked me tonight.  You picked me.  That's one of the most unique things.  That's great.  I am picking one guy and I am going to heckle the shit out of him.  How do you think of that?  And how do people, how do they notice though?  Because so many people yell in so many names. 
[02:57:00]  Is it just his voice is that loud?  No, he sits right down near home plate and it's Tropicana Field, which is like sitting  in a food court.  What a prick.  No, dude, that guy is fucking hilarious.  And the genius of it is you actually separate him from his team because his teammates are now  alive.  This is a classic divide and conquer.  Ace Frehley is not here.  What is the scoop?  Even though Roland goes, he's five minutes out.  Five minutes out.  We heard that about 10 minutes ago.  His publicist has checked in. 
[02:57:30]  Ace has yet to.  Well, what about him?  Ace has yet to check in downstairs.  I'm sitting here telling old road stories.  No, I like it.  I went to Mile High Stadium.  I like it.  I like it.  I'm sure he'll be here.  Oh, boy.  Why did Roland say he's five minutes?  Maybe that's what the publicist told him.  I'm sure.  What happened?  But he said the last time.  Let's just say, what happens if Ace doesn't show up today?  Then he doesn't come.  Oh, boy.  I like Ace.  I would love him to come.  I actually love Ace.  But if he doesn't come, he doesn't come.  Okay.  What are you going to do?  I just didn't want to.  What if he shows up at 10.01?  What if Ace said, Jimmy, meet me in Europe, and you went to Europe, and you didn't show 
[02:58:00]  up, and he left you there?  Would you still listen to Kiss music?  On the flight home, laughing to myself at the good-natured joke he played on me.  Say the ribbing.  That Ace got me good.  You hear about Mark Burnell?  You're a sports fan.  The Jets are a backup quarterback.  No.  They're saying when he retires, he's, what, 40, 41?  He's got to get a 9-to-5 job.  He blew all his fucking money.  Holy shit.  With bad investments.  Oh, man.  This just came out today.  Some Bernie Madoff shit?  They're saying as soon as he's not in the NFL anymore, he's got to start a 9-to-5 job 
[02:58:30]  immediately.  Wow.  He's like $27 million in the hole, right?  Yeah.  $24.7 million he owes.  How about you fucking just declare bankruptcy at that point?  Jesus.  He's on the hook for $24.7 million?  Yeah, well.  And they pass it on to us.  I would.  As soon as he retires, he's got to get a job.  Wow.  You think he's going to get a 9-to-5 and be able to pay that off?  Dude, that's like that one guy.  That one guy in the Jets who has like nine kids with eight different women.  It's like, dude, do you understand the second you stop playing, you're broke? 
[02:59:00]  You're done.  Yeah.  All your money's gone.  Yeah, I would sit down with all those women and be like, okay, here's the deal.  We can live like rock stars for eight years and then go right back to eating at the ground  round and Chuck E. Cheese, or we can live decently forever.  What is your choice?  He had eight kids with like eight different women.  Seven different women or something.  Do you think he honestly is going to be rational enough to... 
[02:59:30]  It's going to be a rational roundtable discussion.  I know, right?  No, I'm trying to figure out if I was managing him.  I bring all those in-the-raw women.  What happened?  What wrong?  He's five minutes away?  Where?  Where is he right now?  I want to know.  Five minutes means ten minutes.  You know that.  At least ten, maybe fifteen.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, Christ.  What happened?  What happened?  He's a rock star, man.  He's on his time.  It's all good.  Come on, man. 
[03:00:00]  You can't expect rock stars to always show up.  Because of his financial misfortunes, he's got a job lined up as a medical sales representative.  Oof.  Oh, no.  Like the guy that goes around selling fucking catheters and shit?  Well, he did declare bankruptcy, but he's got to get a gig to just...  Now, how did he lose it?  Was he buying jet skis?  Like, what's his face?  Horrible.  Well, he went with a company that invested in high-end real estate properties just when  the market fucking took it down. 
[03:00:30]  Oh.  And he was invested in Whataburger fast food franchise.  What?  A Whataburger fast food franchise.  What a ripoff.  What a mistake.  Holy shit.  Here's Ace Frehley.  Oh, there we go.  Hey, see, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Here's Ace.  Scarlett Johansson's fucking ass.  Oh, my God.  Where is that picture?  Yeah.  I saw it really quick the other day.  Can I see that, too?  Can I see it?  I want to see it.  Fuck.  I'm in third game.  Ace!  What's up, Ace?  What's going on? 
[03:01:00]  How are we now?  Ace.  Really?  Of course.  That's the angry baby in Oslo.  You ever been to Oslo?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  He's probably sold it out nine million times.  Yeah.  You want Anomaly?  Yeah.  You want Anomaly?  All right.  Not promoting the book.  It's been a couple years, right?  Yeah.  Things haven't changed much.  No.  Believe me.  Same shit.  Yeah.  For Jimmy's birthday, we had you in.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:01:30]  To surprise Jimmy.  Yeah, you brought me a cake with a girl's ass with a log of shit coming out of it.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah.  It was slightly obscene.  Yeah, it was great.  Are we in there right now?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how we roll.  We got to get that montage together of people.  Absolutely.  Just every guest that has said that to us.  We don't know if that's good or bad when guests ask that.  Is this live right now?  Yeah.  We on the air.  Do you guys consider this entertaining?  It's basically what they're saying.  Real professional.  Me?  Yeah.  Do you have, what kind of information do you have? 
[03:02:00]  Oh, well, right now on Amazon, the book, it's number one in biographies for composers  and musicians.  It's already number one in entertainment music, and it's number four in books, biographies,  and entertainers.  And it's in the top 100.  And it just came out yesterday.  There you go.  It's great.  Go figure.  I'm almost finished with it.  I've probably got like 20 pages left.  It's fucking, you did a great job, man.  Thanks.  It's, this is something I wanted to ask you. 
[03:02:30]  The opening line of the book, you write, when I was a kid, I used to carry this awful  image around in my head, a picture of three men tangled awkwardly in high tension wire,  50 feet in the air, their lifeless bodies crisping in the midday sun.  Why?  Why?  Well, you know, my dad helped build the installation, the electrical installation for West Point.  And, oh, you didn't read the book then.  No, I, well, I, I got to the opening line and I just got bored and I closed it. 
[03:03:00]  No, that wasn't, I just, I just, you know, I don't want to just say it because then if  I just say it.  Yeah, my dad was working with other guys installing the new electrical installation at West Point.  He went, he'd draw a short, a short straw to go get the sandwiches.  He came back and his buddies, you know, got electrocuted because somebody inadvertently  had flipped the switch.  Wow.  So basically, if he had not drawn the short straw.  They became crispy critters, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was terrible.  So if he hadn't done that, literally he might have been up there and he would have been  no you.  If he wouldn't have drawn the short straw, I would have been a bright idea, I guess only. 
[03:03:30]  Wow.  Are you, uh, are you doing book signings or no?  Yeah, I'm doing one at Barnes & Noble here in town tomorrow.  What is your relationship now with, uh, like Gene and Paul?  Because I think you were pretty fair in the book.  Like, you slam a little bit, but not, it doesn't seem bitter.  It seems like it's a pretty honest assessment of what happened.  Well, you know, there's good and bad in every relationship, just like a marriage.  So, uh, yeah. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, I had lunch with Gene about, you know, four or five weeks ago.  Did you pay?  We just hung out and, uh, reminisced.  Uh, did you see what he said about me, uh, on page six the other day?  I heard audio.  Is that the audio where he said that you were saluting him like Hitler?  I just heard that.  What?  Is that old audio or is that new?  No, I was on page six the other day in the New York Post and they, people, whoever  wrote the article was quoting parts of the book where I'm talking about Gene and giving 
[03:04:30]  everybody crabs, this, that, and the other thing.  And then they got a statement from Gene.  Nobody has it here.  Where is that?  Uh, we're not, we're not a prepared radio show.  He said something to the, he said something to the effect that.  Sam will find it.  Uh, brilliant.  Ace has been an alcoholic and a drug addict for 35 years, but we love him, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you didn't say there's decades of your life that you don't remember or something?  Yeah, probably.  That's why I needed help on the book.  But, you know, the 35 years is incorrect.  It's incorrect. 
[03:05:00]  It's a false statement.  I've been an alcoholic for at least 40 years.  And, um, you know, proud of it.  But, recovering at this juncture, you know, five years plus.  Oh, good, good, good.  Yeah.  I celebrated five years on September 15th.  Oh, that's great.  Any urges at all?  Any urges at all?  Because I, I, I'm so, occasionally I get them.  Yeah, the first couple of years are the hardest and then I, subsequently every year after  that gets easier and easier.  Now, you know, people drink in front of me, it doesn't even bother me.  Do you have any vices?  Any vices?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I grew up, most of my life was sex, sex, drugs, and rock and roll. 
[03:05:30]  So, you take away the drugs, you still have rock and roll and sex.  Two out of three ain't bad, right?  Like, like Meatloaf said.  You, uh, there's quite a few fucking near misses in this book, too.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah.  Electrocutions, you know, um, human sacrifices.  No, with drugs.  Like, there's a couple of times where you, uh, the one I just read was really interesting.  You were flying into a foreign country and you had an eight ball in your sneaker. 
[03:06:00]  No.  And it seems like you got these really weird premonitions at times where shit was about  to go really bad for you.  No.  And, uh, what happened on the plane?  That you just felt something might be wrong when you landed?  I just had a premonition, man.  I was going to get popped, you know, if I landed with that stuff on my body.  So, I went into the, uh, laboratory and flushed it down the toilet, which became a little bit  of a problem.  We needed that ace.  Oh, yeah.  Good fella.  We need, ah, man.  Cameron.  Cameron.  You know, you know, I'm struggling with my addiction.  And should I do it? 
[03:06:30]  Should I not do it?  You know, what's worse, going to jail or getting high for a weekend?  Right.  But, uh, you know.  You didn't do a little bit of it and then flush the rest of it?  No.  No.  I was already so wired just from the dream and the premonition.  I had, like, a nightmare on the plane.  Uh, I was just, uh, happy to get rid of it and get back to my seat before.  Oh, is that what sparked it?  Because the plane was about to land.  That's got to be the most paranoid feeling you could have to be flying on a plane to another  country high out of your mind with drugs on you.  Yeah, yeah.  How do you hold that together? 
[03:07:00]  More importantly, did they check you?  When you got off the plane?  Yeah, when I got off the plane, you know, uh, one of those, uh, drug-sniffing dogs actually  So the premonition was true.  And they examined my shoes and everything.  And then I started panicking.  Man, was there a second one in there somewhere hidden that I had forgotten about?  But, uh.  Wow.  Sure muleed it up your ass.  Yeah.  I never went that far.  I never went that far.  That's how I smuggle fruits and stuff into it.  There you go.  At some point, you've got to be like, all right, you got me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:07:30]  You can't bring fruits and vegetables across the international waters.  I'm not thinking of something else.  But I can.  Those double entendre stuff.  Did it, uh, when you, you talk a lot about the drug use too, and when you were in Kiss,  like how, people would have thought that Gene and Paul were drinkers back in those days.  You would have had no idea that there was such a difference between you and Peter and Gene  and Paul, um, how far into Kiss did that start to become, like, an issue or talked about  or, or, or some sort of a point of strain?  Well, me and Peter both started spinning out of control, you know, once, once we all became 
[03:08:00]  millionaires, you know, too much too soon, you know, like so many other rock stars, you  know, in history.  But, you know, I mean, I'm just lucky that, I mean, every day above ground, you know, I'm  happy for, you know, because by all rights, I shouldn't even be here.  What's the craziest thing you went out and bought when you were at the height?  You had all that money, craziest thing, that you look back now and go, what the fuck?  Really?  Why did I do that?  I mean, I was buying, you know what I, you know what I used to do?  I used to, when I was a kid growing up in the Bronx, I never, you know, my, my parents 
[03:08:30]  were, like, middle class, but we couldn't afford, you know, expensive toys and gadgets.  So I would always go to hobby shops and buy the most expensive radio-controlled helicopter,  the most expensive radio-controlled boat, and airplanes, and also, you know, I mean,  spend thousands and thousands of dollars on that stuff, because I could never have that  when I was a kid.  Yeah, and most of them are just sitting in my storeroom, you know?  So just weird, like, shit that you would have wanted as a child you bought as an adult.  Yeah, stuff I never could have, and I wanted, you know, hey, now I can get it, you know? 
[03:09:00]  And, of course, a lot of sports cars, and, you know, some clothes, and...  Did you trash a few cars, um, due to maybe...  Several, yeah.  Drinking and...  God, my DeLorean, I cracked up a 928 Porsche, uh...  Did the DeLorean come with cocaine with it?  Yeah, yeah.  That was such a cool car.  I remember I used to go pick up my daughter at preschool, you know, and all the kids would  come running out to meet the car, the spaceship is here, you know? 
[03:09:30]  Spaceship.  Yeah, you know, the gull-wing doors, and, you know...  Maybe it was because of the driver.  Yeah, and the funny thing about that car, that's the only car you don't wax with, like,  car wax.  Yeah, stainless steel.  You use steel wool polish.  Yeah, it's, like, full stainless steel polish.  It was nuts.  So you...  I was also enjoying reading the Phantom of the Park story, and how much that you thought  it was, like, a whole goof, and how Gene was, like, genuinely embarrassed by that, because  he thought it was gonna be, like, a legit horror film.  Holy shit, really? 
[03:10:00]  I, I mean, I, the whole, the whole movie to me was kind of a goof, but the whole kiss  phenomena was a goof.  I never took it that seriously.  You know, Gene always took everything so goddamn seriously, because he wasn't loaded, and, you  know, he was always thinking about, he was always thinking about money, and this, and  that, and, you know, how, you know, what else can we merchandise, and, you know, and, you  know, that completely went off the charts, and he completely went out of control. 
[03:10:30]  You see, once Kiss got really big, Gene started, in conjunction with our management, started,  you know, over-merchandising the band, to the point where, you know, little kids were  showing up at the show, and I talk about it in the book.  Yeah.  And, you know, all of a sudden, you know, my road manager's going, hey, it's cool with  the, you know, the F-words tonight, because there's a lot of little kids in the front row.  You know?  You know?  Oh, wow.  That's what rock and roll's all about.  Yeah, and you felt, I know you talked a lot about how you felt the merchandising went  way too far. 
[03:11:00]  What was the first thing you saw that you were like, because, like, T-shirts, there  was some publicity stunts where the mayor would wear makeup, like, that stuff was, made  sense, but what was the first thing you saw that you were like, ugh, what the fuck?  Well, you know, the dolls were kind of cool.  Yeah.  You know, but.  Action figures.  The commercials showed them little kids with them, and, you know, the lunchboxes, you  know, but who walks in over the lunchbox except the little kids?  I did.  I mean, I've seen a lot of grown men running around with kids like Foxes, but, you know, 
[03:11:30]  it just got completely out of control.  And it annoyed you?  Anything that's been produced, you know, merchandise-wise, there's usually a Kiss stamp on it.  I mean, it's crazy.  Did you think that, because you also, you stress in the book a lot about how you felt  that the music really took a backseat always to the money and to the merchandising and to  the show.  And how long into it did that start to bother you?  Like, I think the music is suffering.  I can't tell you how many times the following day after a concert, you know, I'd look up a 
[03:12:00]  review in the local paper, and it would talk about the show more than the music.  The music did take a second, you know.  Just a stage.  It was second in a lot of people's minds because the show was so elaborate, you know, but for  me, you know, I love the show, and I love coming up with, you know, I'm the wizard when it comes  to guitar effects, you know, the smoking guitar, the rocket guitar, the light guitar, you name it,  I've done it, but it should never, you know, come before the music.  To me, the music was always the most important thing, you know.  And the fact that it was choreographed, I was surprised, too, that you, it bored you. 
[03:12:30]  You said after a while, because of all the fire and the flash pots and all that, you couldn't  move around on the stage.  Look, you know, I just did two nights at B.B.  King's, you know, and we switched a few things around.  Couldn't do that in a KISS show.  Everything had to go, you know, because everybody, you know, the pyro guy's got a board, and he's  got the song list, and if we do a different song, and he presses the button, you know,  somebody's going to get blown up.  It was that crazy.  It was like a Broadway show. 
[03:13:00]  That's fucking scary.  You had to count on that guy.  I mean, we brought in our own elaborate stage, and we brought in our own lights, we brought  in our own pyrotechnics, and, you know, we had seven tractor trailers at one point.  Wait, that happened to Hetfield at one time, when he was playing guitar, and that whole thing  came up, burned up his hand.  Yeah, I got electrocuted on stage in 1976 in Lakeland, Florida.  I was just talking to the interviewer I did, I was with last night over at VH1, and he 
[03:13:30]  said there is some type of video footage of me getting electrocuted, but they're still  trying to get a hold of this.  How did you get electrocuted?  Well, it was before wireless transmitters.  So, I don't know if you remember the set we used to have where it was like five marshals,  you know, 25 feet high, and we'd come down a staircase, well, you know, here I am in  platform shoes, so I always have to hold on to the railing.  I grabbed the railing, and it wasn't grounded properly, and I got zapped with 220 volts. 
[03:14:00]  Holy shit.  Now, the only thing that saved my life was I got thrown back onto the platform.  If I would have gone forward, you know, I would have probably smashed, you know, cracked my  head open.  How long before people didn't realize that that wasn't part of the show?  You know what I mean?  Because you guys got so many like things, you know, you get zapped and get thrown back.  It took a while for the guys in the band to realize I wasn't even there, you know, because  everybody's doing their own thing, you know?  You know, Gene's preoccupied with sticking his tongue out at the girl in the front row, 
[03:14:30]  you know, and Paul's dancing around, you know, and flipping it, you know.  And finally, they go, you know, they look around, they go, where's Ace, you know?  So, they had to stop the show, and then I had burns on my fingers.  You know, I was actually knocked out for several seconds.  I was going to say, yeah, were you, how soon did you come to?  I think I was, I took about a five-minute break, and then, you know, I managed to put  a coin was there, and he says, Ace, you got to get back out there.  And all of a sudden, the fans and the whole venue started chanting, we won Ace, we won 
[03:15:00]  Ace.  So, my adrenaline started pumping, brought me back to life.  So, you just shook off being electrocuted, and it's unbelievable.  I mean, I fell the other night at B.B.  King's, you know, because there was no luminous tape on the edge of the  stage.  I'm doing my smoking guitar show.  Oh, shit.  You know, I'm going like this, and I'm walking to the right.  You fell off the side.  My right foot goes into the hole where the monitor board is, and I thought I broke my  leg. 
[03:15:30]  Then I looked at my guitar after the show.  I had snapped off the Tune-O-Matic bridge, and what had happened, the guitar took the  brunt of the fall.  Jesus.  If the guitar wouldn't have done it, I would have broke my leg, and I, you know, I don't  know what.  Did you keep playing, or did you stop the solo?  No, I'd jump back up and switch guitars and finish the solo.  Is that embarrassing when that happens?  I've never fallen on stage.  That's probably, well, I've fallen a lot with Kiss, but it was like on the stage, not  off.  I've never fallen off the stage.  That was the first time.  It was a little scary.  Why would you fall on the stage? 
[03:16:00]  Were you ever under the influence?  I used to fall all the time with those boots.  I mean, those platforms.  I could never, you know, Paul and Jean are pretty good with those.  I was never good with them.  What's the most you fell in one show, and did you start getting mad at these motherfuckers  with these boots?  I don't think I've fallen more than twice in one show, but that's enough.  Yeah.  Did it cause resentment with the other members who came up with the idea for the boots?  You know, they got used to it.  In fact, if I would fall, they would try to make it look like it was part of the show,  and they'd like, come over to me and play to me until I, you know, match it. 
[03:16:30]  That's awesome.  Get back up.  Oh, man.  Yeah, gotta keep the rock and roll going.  In those days, we all covered each other, you know.  It's not like every man for himself, you know, towards the end.  What's the craziest thing you ever saw looking out into the crowd?  All your Maniac fans, that even you for half a second had to step back like, am I really  looking at that shit?  It was a lot of crazy shit, you know.  I mean, I remember the last reunion tour, you know, some Oriental board was following  us around, you know.  She'd pull off her panties and write on them, fuck me ace, you know, and hold them up. 
[03:17:00]  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's right.  Did you fuck her?  Yeah, did you make her dreams come from?  No, no, no, no.  Was she attractive?  She was a bad looking.  If she was hotter, would you have fucked her?  Huh?  Would you have fucked her if she was more attractive?  Nah, I'm kind of passed out these days.  Oh, was that recently that happened?  That was in the Kishria unit tour, probably around 2000.  How long did it take you to get that out of your system, where somebody held up panties  and said, fuck me ace, that you didn't give in to that temptation? 
[03:17:30]  How many decades?  A lot of the insanity with women kind of went along with the drinking and the drugging.  And, you know, once I got away from that, I got away from the...  The groupie thing?  The insane behavior.  But, yeah, you know, I also vividly remember, you know, in the 70s, we used to get shots  of penicillin like once a month because the worst thing you could get was like syphilis  or something or gonorrhea, you know?  But, I mean, I remember when the AIDS scare came in and we all kind of were a lot more 
[03:18:00]  cautious.  Except for Gene.  Oh, yeah?  He just kept fucking?  Oh, well, yeah.  Gene, anything, you know, Gene has two prerequisites for a woman, alive and breathing.  You know, it's just like...  So, uh...  What was the crab story?  Because you guys all got crabs?  Yeah.  Because I've had them three times.  I got them twice from the same girl and then once I think a girlfriend cheated and gave  them to me.  They're fucking horrible.  Well, you know, in the old days, Sean Delaney used to pack our leather jumpsuits in one  trunk, throw it, you know, throw it in the truck and, you know, move on to the next 
[03:18:30]  show.  Oh, God.  You know, Gene was infested with them and the little buggers jumped from one costume  to the other.  Next thing you know, all four of us are scratching, you know?  Oh, shit.  And everybody goes, Gene!  You know, but...  We kind of laughed it off in those days.  You ever have them on stage?  Did you guys have the shaved pube show after that time?  I can't remember the name of that stuff we have to apply.  RID was what I used.  R-I-D, yeah.  Oh, God.  It was that little comb? 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, it was terrible.  I used to have...  I have straight pubes, like a Chinese person's hair.  I have awful pubes.  So I fucking...  I finally shaved them completely now, but it was fucking terrible.  It's a violating feeling when I had an itch and then you look down and you pull this  black thing out and you see leg.  It's fucking terrible.  It's creepy.  Yeah.  And then you gotta, you know, you gotta boil all your sheets and it's crazy.  How many times did you have them?  Did you have them more than once?  I may have had them twice in my life, you know, but Gene was pretty much infested for  several years during that period.  Oh, no. 
[03:19:30]  I love infestation.  He had infestation.  He should have been condemned.  By the Board of Health.  He should have put a sign on...  A quarantine on his door.  Are you happy he's married?  Am I happy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When I had lunch with him, I was saying, Gene's going, Ace, you know, I'm going to tie  the knot.  I said, it's about time, Gene.  And, you know, I mean, Shan's a great lady and, you know, she stayed with him all these  years and gave him two beautiful children, you know.  I think he did the right thing.  When you left, it was... 
[03:20:00]  You just really wanted out.  I was surprised to read that.  I thought for some reason, I thought they asked you to leave.  I didn't realize that Peter had already left and you absolutely...  They almost begged you to stay in the band and you just didn't want to anymore.  They both asked me to stay, you know.  But, you know, between all the drugs I was doing, I was living in isolation in this big  mansion in Connecticut with a recording studio.  And, you know, in my mind, you know, if I didn't get away from the band, I was going to die. 
[03:20:30]  And, you know, that's...  It was a tape that kept playing over and over in my head.  You know, I'm sitting in my lawyer's office and I'm going, I got to leave the band.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to kill myself.  And he's going, yeah, but it's $15 million, Ace, you know.  Buys a lot of therapy.  I said, therapy doesn't work when you're six feet under, you know.  I don't want a dirt nap, you know.  And so you guys had made a lot of money, but then you had this other contract where  it was going to be $15 million apiece and you knowingly just said, I can't do it.  No, it's a $15 million record contract for the four of us.  And I ended up walking out and it was actually cut in half because of me. 
[03:21:00]  I don't think they ever forgave me for that.  Oh, they lost $7.5 million?  Oh, I bet Gene wasn't happy.  In the 70s, you know how much money that is?  Fuck yeah.  That's a lot of money.  Sorry, guys.  Why did Peter leave?  Peter was fired.  But, you know, Peter ran into the same problems I did eventually, you know, with abuse.  And he had a car accident and, you know, it affected his playing. 
[03:21:30]  Were you there when he got fired?  Did you guys all sit down or was it a...  Well, I actually didn't want Peter fired, you know.  I figured, you know, let's put him in the hospital and get him cleaned up and give him another chance.  But Paul and Gene were pretty adamant that, you know, they didn't want to give him another chance and they just wanted to move on.  So I was pretty much outvoted.  So I had to go along with it.  How's he doing now?  Peter's doing okay.  You know, I spoke to him not that long ago.  I saw him at Bill O'Coin's Trundle down in Florida. 
[03:22:00]  And he's hanging in there.  I heard he's working on a book also.  Is he still partying?  Is he still performing?  No partying.  Is he still partying or is he...  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Got shit together.  Good.  Yeah, I always found it interesting because it's like you guys put out so many...  So much material in the first few years of your existence.  Most bands put out an album in a couple years later.  And you pumped out, what was it, three...  How many albums in the first 18 months?  Up to a while.  Four albums.  Wow.  In eight...  Four albums.  Three studios.  That does not happen anymore.  Yeah, I'm sitting with my ghostwriter. 
[03:22:30]  And he's telling me...  He's giving me these statistics because he did his homework, you know.  I mean, so many people know more about Kiss than I do because, you know, I lived there  but I forget the numbers and the dates.  He says, man, you did four albums in 18 months and between those albums, you're touring extensively.  He goes, that must have been insane.  It was.  It was just like this rollercoaster ride that never ended.  Well, your first three records, too, they weren't selling...  I mean, they were okay, but you said Casablanca almost went broke because you guys just weren't 
[03:23:00]  selling records until live.  I mean, we came out with Kiss, then we came out with Hotter Than Hell, and then we came  out with Dress to Kill.  And after Dress to Kill, you know, things were shaky.  You know, I know Bill O'Coin had extended himself and Neil Bogart had, you know, put  a lot of their own personal money into the band.  And if Alive wouldn't have taken off like it did and become, you know, a huge record,  you know, who knows what would have happened.  Why do you think bands take so long today to, like, you know, we had Tony Iommi recently 
[03:23:30]  and he talked about Black Sabbath, the record.  That took, like, I think two days in the studio or one day.  And I know your first album especially didn't take...  Why do bands obsessively take a year now, whereas back then you could do it in a week  or two months or whatever?  I don't know.  You know, it has a lot to do with the producer, you know.  Sometimes, you know, in the old days, the band used to get together and just knock it  out, you know.  Now, you know, you get the producers that bring in there and go, okay, we'll do your part  today and then tomorrow we have Johnny in the studio and then we have, you know, Bubby 
[03:24:00]  in the studio, you know, because they're making more money, you know.  They're getting a piece of the studio, they're charging a larger fee and, you know, we did  it old school back in those days.  It's been four days getting a snare drum sound.  Yeah.  Man, I remember walking in the studio at like 9 o'clock in the morning and we're still  working on drums, they just come back after lunch, you know, trying to get the perfect  drum sound on it, you know, get every ring out of every...  Nothing worse than sitting there and just listening to the...  Doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh, doosh. 
[03:24:30]  No, they...  Oh, God, shut up.  Nothing worse than a drum check.  Now everything's canned.  You know, you can get samples and get perfect drum sound, you know.  You know, a lot of people today, when they record an album with drums, they end up replacing  the drums with sampled sounds, you know.  They just trigger them.  I bet...  I'm not sure about this, but I bet in the old days, too, you could just write some songs,  throw them on an album, put the album out, and then, you know, you write some more songs,  put it on an album, and now it seems to me like the record company probably has some 
[03:25:00]  kind of say, like, oh, you know, we need more hits, so we need a little more of this,  and they're probably more selective as to what they want you to put out as a band than  in the old days.  You know, it depends on the type of group.  If you're a single-orientated band, absolutely, you know, if you're...  But how many album-oriented bands are there out there now?  You know, KISS was always...  We always made more money at live performances, and we really weren't a single-orientated band  until Rock and Roll Night, you know, and Beth and stuff like that started happening, 
[03:25:30]  you know, but...  Yeah, it was all about the live show, that's for sure.  Yeah, well, I think that's why a live, you know, took off like a bat out of hell, because  it was the perfect souvenir for a KISS concert.  Hey, why did you guys decide to take the makeup off the first time, and how scared were you?  Well, I wasn't there.  Oh, you wanted to know?  I had quit the group in 82, and then the guys decided to get, what did they get, Vinnie  Vincent?  Vinnie Vincent.  But for a while, Vinnie had some kind of onk on his head or something, an Egyptian thing, 
[03:26:00]  and then they decided to take it off, and then, you know, they had a nice one.  Did you think, looking outside, that that was a mistake, when they were going to take  the makeup off, like they were killing a major hook?  No, well, I took my makeup off and started, you know, Pirelli's Comet, you know, and that  did well.  I had a gold album, the first out of the box, but, you know, also, you know, after I had  left KISS, you know, it wasn't the, with complete creative control and freedom, it wasn't,  you know, the ideal situation either, because everything was on me.  You know, when I was in KISS, I could lean on those other guys, because they were workaholics, 
[03:26:30]  and then I realized, wow, it's up to me, if this record sucks, it's because, they're  going to say it sucks.  So, you know, it wasn't the dream that I had imagined while I was still in the band,  but, you know.  You're like, I don't got to wear that stupid makeup.  The makeup became a real drag.  I mean, imagine having a hangover, and then having, getting a phone call at 8 o'clock in  the morning and say, you got to go to a radio station promotion, and you got it in full 
[03:27:00]  costume.  You know?  Ugh.  Yeah, that, I mean.  It's not even for a show.  It's like.  It was a nightmare.  Did you half-ass it sometimes?  Just fucking like, eh, fuck it.  Just one star.  I was coming up with all kind of crazy ideas.  I said, could we get stencils or something?  Can we just raise the shit on?  And, you know, it was just like, God, I got to do this again?  You know, I talk about it in the book where I'm doing the film.  You know, I'd show up on set while we were doing Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park, and 
[03:27:30]  you know, I'd get into my trailer, get into makeup, and, you know, the director would say,  hey, we're going to do close-ups on Gene today.  We don't need you till 1 o'clock.  You know, and I'd slip out, you know.  You'd sit there and do fucking makeup.  But then you took off and fucking went to a King Tut exhibit and then came back and apologized.  It was a bizarre thing.  I was like all bent out of shape because it happened more than once, and I lost my temper  with the producer and director.  I took off, lost my bodyguards, you know, zigzagging through traffic, and then I just  said, I ended up at the La Brea Tar Pits and a museum there, and I've always been fascinated 
[03:28:00]  with the Egyptian culture, you know, the pyramids, the whole nine yards, and I'm standing  outside going, wow, this would have been a great thing to see, and some broad just comes  up to me and hands me a ticket.  You go, you need a ticket?  You look like you need a ticket.  I said, yeah.  I go, how much?  He goes, oh, you can have it.  It was insane.  You know, most of my life seems like a dream.  It's a fantasy.  I bet.  It's just weird stuff that just, when I read it, I read it cover to cover when I got the 
[03:28:30]  final version, and I said, wow, what a great movie.  Yeah.  Who would you want to play you?  Play me?  I don't know.  Probably somebody who looks a little like me.  Yeah, I guess that would help.  We'll have to find something.  Okay, we'll have to find, maybe we can get Scorsese to do it, huh?  The book is called No Regrets, too, and it's fantastic.  I just wish I had finished it.  I'm like 30 pages short.  I'm a twat.  Look at the pictures.  They were great.  They were really great.  A lot of them nobody's seen.  I like a lot of the young photos. 
[03:29:00]  You're a handsome guy, and I like some of the fucking outfits that you had on in the 70s.  And two things, too.  I want to say, you said you and Gene were roommates at one point, and that you think Paul was happy  that he was with you, and you said he was disgusting.  You said Gene Simmons in the hotels was disgusting as a roommate?  Dirty.  Like, why was he dirty?  I'm surprised to read that.  Why?  Like, what would they do that was dirty?  You gotta ask him, you know.  I mean, Shannon's nickname for Gene used to be stinky. 
[03:29:30]  Would he really spit on the floor, though?  You said he was just hawking loogies on the floor.  Yeah.  Well, you know why?  Spit on his own floor.  You know why?  Because whenever he breathed fire, he'd be drinking kerosene, and a lot of times he would  swallow some of it.  So he's constantly trying to, after a show, he's coughing it up, you know.  Spitting down on the crabs.  You're in a holiday inn, you know, I'm jumping over crabs, and, you know, flops, and this  and that, and, you know. 
[03:30:00]  It was all in good fun.  Where's, uh, yeah, when he burned his pubes off, is that what he did?  He quit casting his knees.  He was just spit the fire on the floor.  My jeans head went on fire a couple of times.  Did you laugh, or were you worried?  No, I was worried.  Okay.  I was, I was, you know.  Did you laugh afterwards, though?  Well, you know, after we knew it was okay, we thought it was hysterical.  Of course.  You know, Sean Delaney attacks him with a towel, you know, and ends up rubbing off half his  makeup.  Who was Sean Delaney?  Sean Delaney was our tour manager in the early days, and he was responsible for a lot of the 
[03:30:30]  choreography in the beginning.  You know, he worked with us, you know, with our moves, you know.  The classic kiss moves that you see.  A lot of them were Sean Delaney's ideas.  Okay.  You wouldn't have thought to do that.  He said, why don't you guys walk up at the end of the song and all do this or do that?  Yeah.  What's the, uh.  Sean was very instrumental with that.  What's the best band that ever opened up for you?  Were you actually standing, even at the height of you, was going, oh my god.  The best band, I don't know, you know, we've had some, you know, we've had Rush open for  us, we've had, uh.  Back in the day, they were like unknown? 
[03:31:00]  Bob Seger.  Well, they were known, but you know, it seemed like every group who were open for a Kiss tour,  after that tour, they ended up headlining because they had gotten so much, uh, you know,  exposure.  Because all we were playing was arenas.  Yeah, I remember Bob, after the tour, Bob Seger gave me, you know, a gold record, you  know, and a thank you.  Oh, for giving him the shot.  Yeah.  You know, you open up, look how many people you're exposed to.  In those days, you know, it wasn't MTV, it wasn't the internet.  So, you know, praying before a live audience was one of the best ways to get known. 
[03:31:30]  Do you have information on your signings, too?  Because I want to plug the signings before we wrap, because, uh.  On my signings?  Yeah, do you have any, uh.  Where's my assistant?  Do you have, uh, info on the signings?  Yeah, 12 o'clock noon at Barnes & Noble on Thursday.  Noon on Thursday, Barnes & Noble, which one?  Fifth Avenue.  Fifth Avenue, which is, uh, I think in, uh, Union Square.  I believe that's the Union Square, Barnes & Noble, or no?  I'm not sure.  I think it's the one here. 
[03:32:00]  Where, here?  Like, on, uh, 48th Street.  On 48th Street?  44th, I'm hearing.  On 44th?  Is there a website that they can go to?  Yeah, go to acefreely.com.  Acefreely.com, and it's F-R-E-H-L-E-Y.  I, I've, I fucking have not been able to spell your name for 30 years.  It's German.  Freely.  I always spell it wrong.  A lot of people pronounce it Freely, but it's Freely.  I would have said...  Ace Freely, Freely admits that Freely is the proper pronunciation.  Oh, it is, it is Freely?  Freely, yeah.  That's so odd, because no one is gonna say Freely. 
[03:32:30]  No one is ever gonna say Freely.  Everyone says Freely.  Listen to a, listen to the live record.  Paul Stanley goes, Ace Freely, lead guitar.  I probably think he's saying it wrong.  Like, everybody's probably like, why did he say it like that?  Pretty much.  Oh, fuck, I didn't know that.  Freely.  Ace Freely.  Are you, are you gonna change your pronunciation, Jim?  No.  I'm not.  No.  I'm just happy you say my name.  Yeah.  You can mispronounce it, you know.  It works.  Well, the book is great.  Uh, go to acefreely.com.  What?  See, I just fuck how fast I just changed.  Nice, that sounded good.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  And, uh, get information on the signings, because I'm sure the signings will be mobbed.  And, uh, it's genuinely a great book, man.  And, uh, again, I learned a lot about, I thought I knew everything about Kiss, because  I've been a fan since I was just a boy.  Some people were saying to me the other night, man, you've been in a lot of fights, they said  to me.  And I go, you know, I'm from the Bronx, you know, I'm a Taurus, you know.  Give me a stage where this bull can rage.  If you...  I'm not sure.  Give me a stage where this bull here can rage.  Although I can fight.  Although I can fight, I much rather recite. 
[03:33:30]  That's entertainment.  What are you going to do?  How great is it?  Just doing raging bull lines with Ace, there really is nothing better than that.  You should just hang out and do them all day.  And that's just my fantasy.  I've never hung out with De Niro.  There's one guy I've always wanted to hang out with.  Have you met him?  Maybe.  You know, I met so many people in those studio 54 years.  It's just like, a lot of it's a blur.  I'm dancing with Lindsay Wagner.  I'm hanging out with John Belushi.  You know, the Stones, Alice Cooper.  So how many times does that happen to you when somebody just comes up to you like, hey! 
[03:34:00]  And you've got to be like, hey!  I don't remember you.  I have no clue.  I'm good at that.  You know?  Not remembering people's names.  I go, how you been, man?  Long time no see.  What are you up to?  You know?  I don't know who it is.  Yeah.  But you know.  Over the years, you get good at that.  All the fans, that's all you've got to do.  Just walk up to Ace.  Act like you met him before and actually shoot the shit without hanging out and talking to you.  Yeah, dude, you invited me to your house.  All right, let's go.  Oh, yeah, cool.  I finally got time in my schedule.  All right, man.  I said, give me a call. 
[03:34:30]  Give me a call.  Did you really remember my shit cake?  Yes, I did.  Okay, good.  Yeah, I remember being here and...  That'll make Jimmy very happy.  I had a video camera going and...  Yeah.  Were you licking it or sitting in it?  I ate the log.  You were doing something obscene with it, weren't you?  Yeah, there was a little shit log and I felt obligated to eat it.  I had a respect for the chef.  You know, all these years later, now it makes sense.  Fraley's Comet.  See, Fraley's Comet doesn't make sense.  Fraley's Comet sounds like Haley's Comet.  Yeah, I guess you got it. 
[03:35:00]  Holy shit.  I never noticed it.  God.  I was thinking of the other day.  Even Fraley's Comet I thought was a great name for a band.  I did, too.  Yeah, I know.  I did, too, but it didn't make any sense.  Yeah, Fraley's Comet, Haley's Comet.  At the same time, you have Frampton's Camel.  You got Ritchie Blackwell's Rainbow.  You know, it was the 80s.  Yeah, but we didn't say...  We had Comets, Rainbows, or Camels.  Is that why you came up with the name?  Was it like Haley's Comet, Fraley's Comet?  Well, you know, I was the Spaceman and I thought it really fit.  You know, I was actually... 
[03:35:30]  Somebody came up, showed me a picture, an actual great photograph of Haley's Comet.  And it was the first album cover, if you remember correctly.  Fraley's Comet.  Wow.  I never would have...  Fraley's Comet to me was fine.  I never would have connected it.  And he finally...  I just thought it meant Comet.  All the pieces in the puzzle finally fit.  Yeah, finally.  I thought it was Comet just because he was blazing up and down the fretboard.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  That's what I thought.  Right, right.  No, I knew it was a play on Haley's Comet.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Of course I did.  I know a lot about space.  He's yelling at him. 
[03:36:00]  It was supposed to be called Ace's Asteroid.  And he said, fuck that.  Am I correct?  No.  You know, I don't know.  Thursday at noon.  Let me plug your signing.  Thursday at noon, Barnes & Noble, 555 Fifth Avenue.  And it's called No Regrets.  And also Friday at bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey, 6 p.m.  Some of you went to see I owe me a couple nights ago.  Go Friday for Ace at 6 o'clock.  It's an amazing independent bookstore in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  And, you know, you get to get the book signed and meet him.  And don't expect a long conversation. 
[03:36:30]  There's going to be a big fucking line.  But definitely go and buy the book and get it signed.  Just act like you've met him before.  You'll get a hug.  Yeah.  Ace, you said I didn't have to pay for that.  Thank you guys so much.  Thank you, Matt, very much.  Thank you, Ace.  It was a pleasure.  Jimmy, you need to promote Stress Factory this weekend?  Tonight, tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, I'm at the Stress Factory.  And antisocial tickets with myself, Stan Hope, Artie Lang, and David Tell.  Pre-sale is now comcasttix.com.  C-O-M-C-A-S-T-T-I-X dot com. 
[03:37:00]  And password antisocial.  Nice.  And, Bill, thank you.  That's a sick, sick show.  That's a good line.  That is a sick show.  You've got to go see that.  All right.  Bill, you got anything?  You good?  I'm coming back to Duke Carnegie on the 11th, so I'll be here on the 10th.  I'll be on the 10th.  Come in and I'll say hello to you, fucking animals.  Sounds good.  All right, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Thank you, Ace.  Serious XR.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:37:30]  Yes, indeed.  That's the name of the show, After Opie and Anthony Live.  And I'm the guy that they just talked about, Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony have left the building.  I saw, I was putting the video camera and all that stuff away in the office right after  the last segment as Ace was signing books and wrapping up in here.  I saw the funniest thing.  It was, I saw it, because you hear about these things, and sometimes I see it happen through 
[03:38:00]  the glass, but you don't get to, you know, see it and hear it and be a part of it.  Roland actually yelling and running down the hall, chasing Opie, trying to get his guest  pitches.  Hey, what do you think?  Wait, wait, wait, what do you think?  Wait, do you think we could, we don't have anyone on Thursday, right?  It's just hilarious, and Opie, I mean, you know what, as far as Opie was concerned, if  you catch me before I hit the elevator, you caught me, but if you don't, you didn't.  You know what I mean?  Like, this is the window of time you have to pitch your guest. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, the 30 seconds from here to there.  Yeah, and if you're not walking alongside, you're not keeping up this pace, this is the  pace that has been, I'm the pace car here.  Okay, this is the pace that's set for this.  I don't know if Roland's around, but I should say that the after show, this show, after  Opie and Anthony Live, is brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms.  Trojan, America's number one most trusted condom brand.  And Roland is now walking up the hallway, making jerk-off gestures toward me. 
[03:39:00]  Yes.  He's marching down as if I've said something offensive.  What's wrong?  You're talking shit about me.  I wasn't talking shit.  I said you were chasing Opie down the hall trying to get guest pitches out.  And it was funny.  Oh, no, no, no, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great.  Oh, well, that's accurate then.  That's, that's accurate.  Hey!  Wednesday!  Oh, so we don't have anyone for Thursday, do you think you're going to...  You know, I saw Marty McFly. 
[03:39:30]  Doc!  Back in the time!  Except, uh, Opie wasn't turning around going, what?  He was, sorry dude, just kept walking.  You can't keep up.  And then, and then Anthony walked by, he goes, whatever they said, like, it's a yes!  Yeah, Anthony goes, whatever, whatever the room goes with.  Okay, so that's one yes.  So, uh, Opie, Jim, then, can you, do we, after that pitch, do we have any...  There are a few yeses.  Okay.  Now we just have to wait for confirmations before the...  It's confirmed, it's, it, I send the emails out, it's confirmed. 
[03:40:00]  It's already confirmed.  It's already confirmed.  So who's coming in?  You want to hold off, though?  Yeah.  Well, no, no, no, are you...  You, you, no, I'm saying, you want to hold off on announcing and stuff.  He's booked.  He's booked.  He.  Three he's, yes.  Three people.  Wow.  You got three guest pitches out that quick?  You know how the mumbler mumbles, and they say yes, yes, yes.  Is that the trick?  You just pretend.  Roland, uh, he, he's, he's from the school of take your flaws and use them as positives. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  You know, like, let, let the mumbling, and, and he's not a good speaker, Roland.  You guys are aware of this.  So let those things that would normally hold somebody back in the field of communications,  the inability to communicate, let that be an asset, and just kind of mumble through  guest names until hosts get frustrated and just say, yeah, okay, yeah, that's fine, yes.  Yes.  And it works.  Obviously it works. 
[03:41:00]  I'm, I'm going to go see the Muppets now.  That was yesterday.  But, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the projector or whatever the hell broke down.  The projector was broken?  It wasn't working properly for the film.  You made a big deal yesterday about getting to miss the staff meeting because of the Muppets  thing.  But, but I made to the staff meeting.  I know, I was about to say, but then you get to the screening.  Yeah.  And I guess the projector is broken.  It wasn't, for some reason, it was like the first print of the digital clock.  It wasn't working properly.  Is that like waking up, because you thought you were going to get to miss the staff meeting. 
[03:41:30]  Is that like waking up on Christmas Eve, running downstairs and realizing Christmas is not  today, it's tomorrow?  No, I love the staff meeting.  I was so happy that I made the staff meeting.  You were?  And you felt like a lot got done?  You were, you were psyched about that?  Dude, I was psyched.  Did you fall asleep during this one?  Nope.  No.  This one I can't, no way.  I was, because it was brought to everybody's attention and brought up on the air, and now Roland  is under, under the old proverbial thumb.  And my buddy, and he said, if you fall asleep, let me know.  Who said that?  My buddy, who's his publicist.  Oh.  He said, tell the asshole he'd better not fall asleep. 
[03:42:00]  The asshole is me.  Yes.  Who do you say that to?  He told that to the studio.  Oh, I see.  He said, keep an eye on the ass.  I go, if you hear a snore.  So now you can't, now you can't even sleep during the Muppets.  Oh.  So when are you going to sleep?  I guess you'll have to try to do it sometime.  I was going to say, maybe sometime at night, but you're saying during work.  Yes.  People, as long as there's people, they see people, that's the job.  The studio's full of guests, right?  That's all they care. 
[03:42:30]  And we did survive another Jimmy, I think Annabella's looking for you.  Okay, yeah, and, ah!  He's looking for, oh, you must be going to the Muppets.  Have fun, Roland!  Bye!  You say it loudly so they can hear it outside the door.  Yeah.  I guess the whole talent department is going to see the Muppets, so who's going to bring  the guests in for the next hour and a half?  They canceled all guests for the next hour and a half.  Thank God nobody would ever agree to do this show, because otherwise we would have a problem.  We'd have no bookers.  Luckily, nobody can book on this show. 
[03:43:00]  Not at the fault of the bookers, more at the fault of the host.  Didn't you have Zack Ryder in here?  He was on the phone.  Oh.  Is he a personal friend of yours, though?  Well, I mean, we do direct message on Twitter every now and then, but I don't like to brag.  We survived another Jimmy guest day here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, this show did.  We're in phase two here at SiriusXM, because Jim is now down the hall, as Paul, you, when  Tony Iommi was in here, Jim goes down the hall after this show to record an interview for 
[03:43:30]  the Boneyard, which airs on his Boneyard show.  Eric, do you know what time his Boneyard show is on?  No, I don't.  I'll look it up.  Isn't it like 10 o'clock at night or something like that?  I thought it was...  It kept changing time.  Yeah, that's the thing.  It's on every day on the Boneyard now.  It's on five days a week, but we'll find out what time it is, because he'll have Ace Freely  or Freely.  I'm going to still call him Freely.  But I loved, I loved that Colin Quinn called up the show today.  After we talked to him on the phone about his complete Twitter, I don't know if you could 
[03:44:00]  even call it a debacle.  Yes, Eric?  10 p.m. on the Boneyard, channel 38.  Okay, so on the Boneyard at 10 p.m., every weeknight, 10 p.m. Eastern, Jim does his music  show, and sometimes he gets to interview people.  For instance, Tony Iommi and Ace Freely.  Now, I couldn't be more happy that Colin called this morning.  After he talked about his Twitter thing and we got back to doing the show, he simply called  in to say that Jim had texted him and said, hey, you should come by the show today or call 
[03:44:30]  in to talk about what happened with you on Twitter.  Just make sure it's before 9.30, because Ace Freely's coming in.  And that just goes to show that throughout when he got here, Jim, at 6 o'clock in the morning,  and you couldn't tell if you didn't know, because he's still putting on a great show, but when  he got here, he was thinking about Ace Freely the entire time, even yesterday.  Well, didn't he mention in his dream he thought Colin came in and screwed it up?  He had a dream about Colin screwing it up.  Even yesterday, when we were talking about, I was listening to the replay of yesterday's 
[03:45:00]  show, and we were talking about books and where they're going in physical media, and  his first theory was that they were going to make 3D printers to print books and all this  stuff, and then he admitted that he didn't know why they would do that.  All he was thinking about was getting a reprint of the Kiss Alive, the book that comes with  the album, so he could get Ace Freely to sign it.  So it's been on his mind a lot.  He pulled it off again.  It was a great interview, and that's the thing about Jimmy Guest Day.  It's hard for anybody to complain, because they're always captivating people. 
[03:45:30]  And I was just sitting there, looking at Ace Freely as he was in here, talking about  his partying with John Belushi, and Lord knows who else, because it's all a blur, and being  with Kiss, and then leaving, and then coming back with the group, and when he was talking  about having this premonition, so he had to flush his drugs that he had on the plane down  the toilet.  It's amazing stories, and I can't believe that a person, that this is just their life experience.  Like, when I look at, like, my life experience, or Paul, your life experience... 
[03:46:00]  It seems kind of boring in comparison, doesn't it?  Right.  I mean, it's, like, you and I have different life experiences.  Absolutely.  But neither of them are that great.  Like, it's like, wait, you were a fisherman for a while, and I've been here forever, so  it's like, wait, wait, okay, sure.  They might be great to us, but...  But people, you forget that, that was just on my mind, that this person, Ace Freely, is  a human being.  Like, he's not an entity.  He's actually a person that at one point was a child, and then became an adolescent, then 
[03:46:30]  became an adult, who had this incredible, who is still having this incredible life experience  where he's a member of KISS, the biggest band, they may be the biggest band ever.  I mean, still, to this day, he's coming in here, and KISS' peak, their heyday, was probably  what?  70s?  70s, 77, 78, 79-ish?  Yeah.  To this day, and he's not even wearing face paint, and he's been replaced twice, but to 
[03:47:00]  this day, when Ace Freely, an original member of KISS, comes into this studio, people come  out of the woodworks.  Like, one of the talent bookers.  And talent bookers, they get to meet everybody, because they're bringing the talent from show  to show.  So, uh, and so they're not, like, starstruck.  They're kind of jaded to all of it at this point.  Yeah, they are pretty jaded.  And they're annoyed when people come around asking for pictures.  Mm-hmm.  And I do it, and Eric does it.  I mean, Eric really does it.  But we all, we all do it.  Um, but, like, it's almost foreign to them, because they see everybody. 
[03:47:30]  Uh, but Ace Freely had one of the talent bookers not only so excited that he was watching the  interview.  Was it Liam?  Like a fanboy.  Well, I'm not, it wasn't Liam.  Oh.  But I don't want to say who it was, because I don't know if he wants to throw his name  on blast out there like that.  Oh, okay.  But he had brought a friend up to be like, this is so cool.  Ace Freely's gonna be here.  And it's like, this is the guy.  They were the biggest band in the world.  Mm.  And, and, you know, you could say a lot about them in terms of, I know their musical 
[03:48:00]  integrity is questioned very often.  And it was interesting that Ace Freely said that for him, it was more, he was focused  on the music, not so much the product placement and the this and that.  It was also great that Ace Freely, you know, Gene Simmons, uh, puts himself out there as  this, like, you know, mogul and this businessman.  And he always, you know, talks like this.  Yeah.  Deep voice and slow and.  Kind of like one tone.  Thoughtful and like, okay, I'm.  And, but like Ace Freely just painted the picture of this guy who was just giving the 
[03:48:30]  rest of the band crabs and spitting on the floor of the hotel room.  And his girlfriend called him stinky.  Stinky because he didn't shower enough.  Just fucking anything that moved.  Really does.  The 1970s and 80s Gene Simmons was a far cry from the one that had showed up in this studio  before he stopped coming because Ant, uh, trashed him dozens of times.  Well, I think Ant was correct, wasn't he?  Didn't Gene hit on his girlfriend?  Oh, yeah.  Knowing full well?  Listen, Gene Simmons was a huge douchebag. 
[03:49:00]  Um, and I don't think that's ever been questioned so much.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but when he, when, I don't think it's ever been questioned, the doucheness of Gene  Simmons.  But when he came in here, that last appearance, and that was the one where he made a comment  about Ant's then girlfriend, Jill Nicolini, after he had seen her at WB11.  And that was the same appearance when Danny was typing on the keyboard, and Gene put his  hand on Danny's hand as if to say, stop typing, Gene Simmons is here, and it's disturbing, the  great Gene Simmons.  That was his last... 
[03:49:30]  I have those clips if you want.  Do you?  I have, uh, talking about the girlfriend, and I have him being annoyed at Danny.  Let's play, they're quick, they're just the clips?  Um, the girlfriend one's 30 seconds, Danny's 53.  Yeah, play, play the Danny one first.  Okay, hang on.  This is Gene Simmons.  Uh, this was the last time, because, you know, Ace, this is the second time we love having  Ace on, just because he is, he's got a, he's one of the most honest rock stars we've  ever had in.  The way he just, like, he wasn't trashing Gene Simmons, but he was just saying, look...  He was just talking about his buddy.  This is how it was.  You know, nobody, nobody, yeah, exactly, nobody, it's his buddy, this is how it was. 
[03:50:00]  Nobody talks about this, like, he wasn't this guy with a, uh, button-down shirt with the  first three buttons unbuttoned and a blazer.  It was this guy who didn't shower, and who gave the rest of the band crabs, and who stunk,  and who just, and who had no standards for women that he would have sex with.  That was the Gene Simmons I know.  Totally sold him out and said, watch your mouth, because kids are in the front row now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a guy who had no integrity for music, the  just wanted to put his name on stuff, uh, that is the Gene Simmons, and it's like, I 
[03:50:30]  had lunch with the guy.  I love the guy, but this is the guy, not, not this Mr. Reality Show man.  This is the guy.  So, yeah, this is the last time Gene Simmons was in.  Uh, I'm sure he'll never be back in, uh, again, but this was when he put his hand over  Danny's fingers as Danny was typing away.  Take the balls.  In Europe, you actually had women who were walking around the courts of Europe and actually  not making noise while I'm talking, like this guy's on the side going, like, Danny was typing. 
[03:51:00]  Danny was looking something up on the internet.  Why are you so uptight?  No, I just want to control everything.  It's just a keyboard.  I know, but just a keyboard to you means he's getting in the way of me.  He's looking up stuff for the show.  Okay.  He's not, like, checking his email.  Flies, flies buzzing around your head, don't bother me.  They bother me.  Noises bother you?  Well, does that really bother you?  At that point, I was trying to gather my thoughts and that, that thing right there, I think that  made me wander a little bit. 
[03:51:30]  Well, how come you don't do that when he's talking?  Go ahead.  I certainly do.  Oh, my God.  All sorts of stuff happens while we're trying to do the show.  Yeah, it doesn't bother us.  The dogs at my home don't bark because they're not allowed to.  You allow them to shit on your carpet.  It's your thing.  And for those of you keeping track at home, I think that does count as another Danny fight.  Danny's fight with Gene Simmons.  That was it.  It wasn't the longest fight, but, you know, you got Mars, you got Steve C., you got little  Nicky, and, of course, Gene Simmons. 
[03:52:00]  And listen, anybody who's had the honor of fighting a rock star like Gene Simmons is okay  in my book.  You want the other clip?  No, I was about to say what was most telling about that clip is Opie, he goes, why are you  so...  Controlling, I think.  No, no, he didn't say controlling.  He said tightly wound, say something like that.  Why are you so tightly wound?  And Gene Simmons goes, I'm not tightly wound.  I just want to control everything.  And I was like, yeah, that would be...  That would explain it.  That's the symptom of being tightly wound. 
[03:52:30]  That's how we figured that out.  And so, yeah, it was just Danny Googling, like, whatever, you know, trying to add something.  And Gene reached over and placed his palm on top of Danny's palm as if to say, the great  one is speaking and you're ruining my weak-minded train of thought.  His words of wisdom.  How weak, how wise can your words be if, you know, this, if, you know, if that's going  to ruin, if that's going to interrupt your thought that was so, so insightful that it 
[03:53:00]  couldn't be interrupted by simply...  Like God is talking to you.  ...pushing buttons.  Yeah, really.  So, and then, what really kind of stopped him from coming in...  And again, we haven't banned him.  He just hasn't come in because Ant said horrible things.  Nah, I think...  You think so?  I think, uh...  I think, yeah, unofficially he's been like, we don't want him back.  Well, I know Ant is a permanent no, you can't come in.  Yeah, because...  I know Jim...  Ant thinks he's a smug asshole.  Right, I know Jim is a permanent yes. 
[03:53:30]  And I call...  Because, you know, he's a kiss fanatic.  He doesn't care.  He doesn't...  Gene Simmons could shit on his mother.  Like, Gene Simmons could take Mrs. Norton and shit on her, literally.  And then Jim...  And then yell at his mom.  And then yell saying, what is all this shit all over the place?  Clean it up.  And Norton would be like, you know, that's an experience we should talk about on the air.  Why don't you come in?  You know?  Like, there is no way that Jim would say no to Gene Simmons. 
[03:54:00]  Because, Opie, I call him Mr. Wildcard, because you don't know which way he's going to go.  So that's why I can't say that Gene has been banned.  Because all it has to do is the wind has to blow a certain wave.  Opie said yes, and Gene was willing to do the show after the horrible things that have been said about him.  True as they may be, they are still horrible.  Yeah, I was going to say, he kind of earned them.  Yeah, he did earn them.  And this is how he earned them.  This was when Ant was dating Jill Nicolini, the traffic girl from WPIX WB-11. 
[03:54:30]  Whatever that dumb station in New York is called.  And Gene had just been there.  Now, and Gene had this knowledge that he wasn't sharing with Ant.  And I think that sets up the clip nicely.  Okay.  There we go.  What do you do for pleasure?  What this?  I will, I intend on fucking your girlfriend tonight.  I don't know.  Hey.  Whoa.  Wait a minute now.  I mean that as a term of endearment.  You actually probably just met her over at Channel 11. 
[03:55:00]  Who?  Oh, Jill.  Yes.  Yes.  No, I'm fucking with you.  But the point I'm making.  The point I'm making.  All of a sudden he looked at me with a little more respect.  I like that.  I'm not at all concerned with respect.  I really am not.  See, what Ant didn't realize at the time.  Is that he had already.  Gene knew that Jill was his girlfriend.  When he was over at the TV studio.  Jill had said, oh, you're going to do Opie and Anthony today.  I'm dating Anthony. 
[03:55:30]  So when Gene.  So when Gene said, I'm going to fuck your girlfriend.  He was really just trying to man him and be a dick.  Because he knew.  That he had just kind of.  And Jill told Ant that he had kind of been, you know, very seductive almost.  Yeah.  Kind of cornering her a little bit.  I was trying to remember.  Didn't later on she texted him all this.  She texted Anthony all of this.  And Ant said, had he known.  Yeah.  That he would have brought this up.  Because there was physical kind of movements.  You know, body language.  Just to let you know. 
[03:56:00]  I'm kind of being sexually dominant here.  Throwing an arm over her.  Right.  Just leaning against the wall.  And Jill said, there was a lot of that going on.  And she told him that she was Ant's girlfriend.  And then Gene Simmons came on O&A.  And looked at Ant in the eyes.  And said, I'm going to fuck your girlfriend.  What a dick.  As if to say, no.  I know who she is.  And I'm going to do it.  Which Ant at the time didn't know.  And if you notice.  Gene, when Ant brought that to the table.  Oh, you probably. 
[03:56:30]  Ant innocently enough.  Yeah.  Said, oh, you probably just saw her.  Thinking that Gene didn't know.  Gene backed down.  Because he.  I'm fucking with you.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  But he was being a dick.  And after that.  After Ant found out.  He has never let Gene Simmons back on the show.  Something that I'm sure Jim Norton would love to correct.  But we have.  We've had Paul Stanley on, I think, once.  Yeah.  And he did the walkover with us, too.  Yes.  And he was great.  Ace Frehley's the man.  I mean, he's been on twice now.  I loved it.  Yeah.  I really did.  He was great. 
[03:57:00]  Like we said.  I'm going to read his book now.  Definitely.  He's just an honest dude who's like, yep.  This is what happened.  Like, I don't have any big, you know, kiss corporate identity to protect.  This is just what it is.  I'm just, you know.  And we never had Peter Criss on, did we?  No.  I think Jim said once he was trying, because I think Peter Criss was doing Chiller Theater.  Yeah.  He was doing a signing.  A couple times.  We were going to try to get him on, but it didn't happen.  Rob, you're on the after show.  After Open Anthony Live, that is. 
[03:57:30]  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, not much.  I did the show.  Nice.  Anyway, did you know Brewer kicked Gene off, too?  Really?  Jim Brewer?  Yeah.  Yeah, Jim Brewer.  He had him on his show, and he was talking, and he said something about screwing Jim Brewer's  sister, and then Jim was like, you know what?  I don't get down like that or something.  You know, in his fashion, I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was good.  And he shut him off and hung up on him.  And he hung up. 
[03:58:00]  Well, why would you go on a show and tell the host you're going to have sex with their  sister?  Well, I've heard rumors of women throwing him off.  One of the mighty Gene Simmons, I guess.  Of course, yeah.  The untouchable Gene Simmons.  He's, you know, hanging out on Mount Olympus, where only he can hang.  Thanks, Rob.  Yep.  See ya.  Well, I mean...  I'll have to look for that now.  It's amazing.  I want to hear that.  Like, you just tell yourself your God's gift to women.  And I was doing research for the Ace Frehley bio.  Apparently, Ace says in the book, the Gene was terrible with women before he was in Kiss. 
[03:58:30]  Like, this isn't like a Gene Simmons...  Like, if he wrote a book on how to pick up girls, it would be start a rock band and make  it the biggest rock band ever.  Because that's the Gene Simmons strategy.  Remember when that sex tape came out?  Oh, yeah.  And we were watching that, and they were all criticizing...  Well, Opa and Jim were criticizing his sexual techniques.  Yes, the Gene...  That he just looked like he was really bad in bed. 
[03:59:00]  Well, weren't his pants down and his ankles still the whole time?  But he kept his shirt on the whole time.  Yeah.  He probably lifted his shirt up right over his belly button right before he came, like,  and just thrusting his fat old man thighs over...  You're getting good with impressions lately.  You think so?  Yeah, well, you did Chris Humphries today.  Duh!  And now you're doing Gene Simmons coming.  Chris Humphries really is just so stupid.  And I can't believe anybody who saw that show didn't think he was a moron.  That was stupid.  But before we talk about Kim Kardashian and Chris Humphries and Colin Quinn we should talk 
[03:59:30]  about, before any of that, we were talking about, you know, Gene Simmons and the way he  picked up women was to be in a rock band.  You gotta be a rock star.  There's only one other way.  Paul, I don't know.  I know you've been having women trouble.  There's only one other way.  Yes, you have.  There's only one.  Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about.  Of course you have.  There's only one other way to pick up women.  And that's to get them a nice gift.  Maybe something in Argentium. 
[04:00:00]  Argentium!  Oh, I was thinking Trojan brand condoms.  No, no, no, no, no.  Argentium.  Ah.  Do you have a second?  What is Argentium?  What is Argentium?  Does anyone know what Argentium is?  Paul, I'll tell you what it is.  It's Steven Singer's new super silver collection.  That's right.  Steven Singer's brand new collection of silver is made from Argentium, the king of all silver  metals.  This is the Gene Simmons of silver metals.  Why wouldn't it just be silver then?  It's unbeatable.  There are different silvers, Eric.  And this is the best silver. 
[04:00:30]  The brand new collection of super silvers starts at just $149.  Only Steven Singer can do that for you.  Argentium is more pure than sterling silver.  It's brighter than platinum.

Then you can visit Steven Singer and get some Argentium and whatever else you need.  It's Argentium from IHateStevenSinger.  And, Paul, that is what's going to help you pick up ladies.  Yeah?  I just got to buy a bunch of Argentium rings.  Yeah, I mean, you could get a bunch.  It's very affordable.  And you'll be saving the planet at the same time. 
[04:02:00]  So I don't see why you wouldn't.  And what chick doesn't dig saving the planet?  And silver.  And silver.  You know, what chick doesn't dig saving the planet and having jewelry?  Yeah, definitely.  And you can't go wrong.  Colin Quinn.  You can't go wrong with him either.  He is the star of Twitter.  By the way, speaking of Twitter real quick, we were talking about Jennifer Hutt on the show today.  There's a lot of Twitter activity going on.  Because it first starts with Jennifer Hutt, who we were talking about whether or not she really is taking these jokes in stride as much as she says she is. 
[04:02:30]  But you insist that she's dying inside.  She's dying.  It hurts her so bad.  Because I've been in the position.  It hurts me.  It hurts your feelings when people like Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton just relentlessly punish you.  And then the listeners keep on doing it.  I know they're not stopping.  I'm not checking her tweets.  But any time she's at mentioned on one of my tweets and there's a reply to her that I'm on, they're just destructive to her. 
[04:03:00]  And her whole psyche and I know it's messing with her confidence.  It's a horrible thing that's going on.  I just wish that she would be truthful with it.  Do you think, Eric, because for instance, let me give you this for instance.  Yesterday, she tweeted a picture of herself with Susan Boyle.  Susan Boyle was walking around SiriusXM yesterday afternoon.  I got to watch her between you and me.  I got to watch her eating lunch in one of the offices here.  I won't say whose office it was, but all the offices here are glass. 
[04:03:30]  And I got to see everything.  And it was amazing.  You've never seen anything like this.  But she tweeted a picture of herself with Susan.  I'm sorry.  Jennifer Hutt tweeted a picture of herself with Susan Boyle.  How did it go, Jim?  Jim's back in here.  We were just talking about Ace Frehley a couple minutes ago.  Now, we were also talking about Gene Simmons, and I said I was sure that Ant would be a constant no on him. 
[04:04:00]  And that you, Jim, no matter what Gene Simmons ever did to you or someone in your family or whatever,  you would always say yes to having him back in studio.  Yeah, I feel that we should say yes to him anyway because if there was a conflict, it should be addressed on the air.  I like that.  You know I like that.  Yeah, I would love to see Gene and Ant talk about it.  Gene may even go, oh, sorry about that.  We listened to the clip a minute ago, and Gene was definitely being a dick.  But at the same time, he didn't go as far as he could have gone. 
[04:04:30]  So I think if confronted on it, Gene would back down.  But I also don't know if Gene would ever do this show because I think he's caught wind of the terrible things that Ant has said about him ad nauseum.  Yeah, it's very possible.  But I will say that Ace was tremendous.  It airs tonight on the Boneyard.  This one's going to be tonight?  Tonight.  And we covered – yeah, on the Boneyard, we covered totally different stuff than the Opie and Anthony interview.  That's great.  Because that was his first one.  So it's completely different, the material we talked about.  We play a lot of Ace and Kiss songs. 
[04:05:00]  We were just talking about how great he was.  But just like he doesn't have this sort of corporate thing hanging over his head where he has to protect the brand of Kiss or he has to protect anyone.  He's just going and writing a book that's just honest.  Here's what happened.  Dude, he walked away.  His lawyer said you might – he really did say that.  It was $15 million on the table.  And he's like, I didn't get into this for the money.  Yeah.  And he really meant it.  And he walked like for real.  And Gene and Paul both asked him like, look, you can do side projects.  Just don't go. 
[04:05:30]  Like they really tried to keep him in Kiss.  And there was $15 million on the table?  $15 million.  It wasn't like that there was – because I didn't realize Peter got fired.  But I was very impressed with that.  Like I was like, what a fucking lunatic.  And then he walked away again.  You're an artist, a man of integrity, a performer.  Well.  If somebody – if you didn't want to perform – if somebody – I don't know.  Say they wrote a set for you and you're like, I'm not going to perform this.  And they said, will you do it for $15 million?  What would your answer be?  I would say let me do this as many times as you need to make sure that every wacky face you require is made. 
[04:06:00]  Fuck that.  I couldn't not do it.  $15 million.  $15 million.  Dude, I would do it for $40 grand.  Fuck it all.  What are we talking about?  That's a lot of fucking money, man.  How much did Ace made though already?  I should have asked him that.  I did not.  Did he have enough money that it didn't matter?  I mean, it's hard for $15 million not to matter.  It mattered, dude.  There's no way that didn't matter.  That's a lot of fucking money.  But he doesn't have any regrets.  He doesn't seem to have any regrets about it now, does he?  I mean, you don't want to interview him.  He's what a fucking groveling fucking pansy boy I am. 
[04:06:30]  After I was leaving the studio interviewing him, I didn't know he was staying there.  So I was trying to put the cap on his water.  I'm like, do you want your water, Ace?  And I'm putting his fucking cap.  But I don't want to twist it because I don't want my fingers to touch where your mouth goes.  But you put the cap back on his water.  On the fucking tongue.  Gingerly.  You know, that's not what interviewers do.  You're not there to put the cap...  You're transitioning between interviewer and assistant.  It's not what men do.  No. 
[04:07:00]  No, it's a homoerotic.  It's what a lover does.  It's like...  It's the same principle as asking Gene Simmons if he wanted to share your banana.  I know.  I meant that metaphorically, of course.  So funny.  When you go...  Because you double back.  You go, you could have the banana if you want.  Or we could share it.  That's just...  Why would you say that?  I don't know.  I mean, literally, I would have eaten it from both ends if he wanted to and rubbed noses  and laughed.  But that is the difference between a guest and a Jimmy Day guest.  A Jimmy Guest Day.  That, like... 
[04:07:30]  You wouldn't have put Mark Wahlberg's water cap back on his water?  No, I love Mark Wahlberg, though.  But not like...  Not like that, though.  Like, you wouldn't have stopped him if it was going to fall on the floor.  I just...  Yeah, not like those guys, man.  Those guys fucking...  And you know what?  Gene was weird to me once, but other times I've met him, he has been really nice to me.  Like, when I roasted him and when...  You know, when he's been on this show, he has been really nice to me.  As a fan, he's been cool to me.  It's amazing.  Because you're talking about the different life experience that Ace Frehley has than any  of us.  But with you, it's like, as a fan, like, you've roasted Gene Simmons. 
[04:08:00]  You've done all this stuff.  But still, seeing the guys from Kiss, you're not yet jaded enough that you wouldn't do something  so silly as to put the cap back on his water bottle.  So, you're still that kid.  Like, it doesn't matter how many experiences you get with this band.  You just go right back there.  But I don't get anything...  Like, I didn't bring anything to get signed.  I had Tony sign a copy of his book, just because it's very standard to sign their book.  I mean, that's completely acceptable.  And I had Ace sign one.  Ace asked me, did you want me to personalize it? 
[04:08:30]  And then he asked me, you want to take a picture?  Like, so we took it in the photo, but I wasn't going to ask him.  But yesterday, you were cursing yourself for not getting the Kiss...  Was it Kiss Alive?  One of the Kiss booklets.  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  It was.  So, you didn't bring anything in.  You were also cursing yourself for not getting a copy of Kiss Alive.  I'm glad I didn't, though, because he signed enough of that stuff.  And I don't want to be the obsessive fan.  Like, it's nice to be able to interview these guys.  It sounds corny, but it's like to give guys something back.  Like, they've entertained me my whole life. 
[04:09:00]  And it's like, all right, so now I can help them promote something.  Plus, you get to talk to them.  And you get to talk to them.  Like, what a fucking dream gig for a fan.  Yeah.  That's what the difference between, like...  And maybe it's a weakness in me as a performer or the ONA show.  But, like, some guys are great interviewers where, like, Howard will get information out of people.  And Charlie Rose gets information out of people.  I can never do that.  You're just listening to a fucking fan talk to somebody they love, which might be...  But if you're a fan...  Boring, and I apologize if it is.  I'm not...  I can't do better than that, because... 
[04:09:30]  If you're a fan, though, of Ace, and that's why you would listen tonight on the Boneyard at 10...  See, I snuck that plug in.  Amazingly.  Well done.  Almost made me uncomfortable.  That's why you would listen, though.  To hear a fan interview.  We gotta wrap up, though, because we're running into Ron and Fez time.  Oh, shit.  Okay, so just so you know, pre-sale tickets are on sale now for the Borgata.  Um, with myself, Stan Hope, Attell, and Artie Lang.  January 14th, one show.  It's gonna sell out.  Yeah, yeah, it will.  Go to comcasttix.com, I think.  C-O-M-C-A-S-T-T-I-X dot com. 
[04:10:00]  Password, antisocial.  And this Thursday through Saturday, I'm in the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.

I've never had an issue with a condom breaking.  Well, neither have I, but Trojans definitely won't.  Stay tuned.
