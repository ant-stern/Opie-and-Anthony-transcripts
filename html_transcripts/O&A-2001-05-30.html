<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts expressing intense anger and frustration regarding their contract negotiations with WNEW.  They vehemently denounced the station's perceived lack of support over the past three years and their discovery that the station could force them to continue working there beyond their contract's expiration.  This led to several expletive-laden outbursts and a discussion of considering alternative offers.  Listener calls followed, some supportive, others critical.  One caller, John, challenged the hosts’ claims about the frequency of their contract discussions. Another, Mario, curtly advised them to "suck it up," further inflaming the hosts.  A surprising call from Tim revealed that several high-ranking WNEW employees privately agreed with their assessment of mistreatment.  The hosts also promoted "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," announcing a "WOW sticker stop" at Meadowlands Ford with an employee nicknamed "Shrek" (or Black Earl), a meeting that later devolved into an argument with the employee objecting to his nickname.  The segment included tangential discussions: a humorous anecdote about a previous night's bar outing with Jim Norton; listener calls about unrelated matters, including a helicopter crash; speculation about Christopher Reeve's appearance and stem cell research; and commentary on Jenna Bush's actions.  Throughout this portion, profanity and offensive language were pervasive.

The show then transitioned to a phone conversation with Earl at Meadowlands Ford, characterized by banter, jokes about his appearance, and racially charged language. This segued into a heated debate about Casey Martin, a golfer using a golf cart due to disability, with the hosts and callers expressing strong, often offensive, opinions on fairness in professional sports.  The segment featured advertisements for Auto Lock Pro, mentions of Jim Norton's presence in the studio and his reputation for inappropriate behavior, and further speculation about Christopher Reeve’s post-accident appearance.  Kelly Ripa called in, and the conversation, also including guest host Jay Moore, was dominated by crude jokes and banter ranging from Ripa's pregnancy to speculation about Regis Philbin's personal life and on-air persona.  Upcoming *Regis and Kelly* guests Wyclef Jean and Billy Gilman were mentioned, as was a comparison between modern overly sensitive Little League and past experiences.  The segment concluded with more jokes and speculation about Ripa and the guest hosts.

A later segment featured a caller, Walter, whose unusual laugh became a recurring comedic element.  This transitioned into another conversation with Kelly Ripa, again highly informal and including sexually suggestive banter between Ripa and Jay Moore, covering Ripa’s pregnancy and career, and their upcoming television appearance.  The conversation then jumped to various topics: Jay Moore's upcoming television appearance; Moore’s strategy for maintaining his marriage while being charming to other women; the hosts' impressions of publicists; a discussion of a controversial Toyota ad; listener anecdotes about celebrities; details about an upcoming show and Jay Moore's schedule; and a lengthy, sexually explicit discussion about sportscaster Bob Murphy. The segment concluded with product promotions and self-promotion, maintaining the informal and offensive tone.

The final excerpt detailed a rambling, sexually charged discussion, heavily focused on baseball but frequently veering off-topic.  Opie, Anthony, Jay Moore, Jim Norton, and Bob Levy engaged in vulgar banter about baseball players (Bobby Bonilla, Jeremy Burnett, Mike Hampton), teams (especially the Mets), and games.  The conversation was saturated with sexually explicit terms, references to bodily functions, and crude jokes about defecation and urination, including a recurring theme about one host’s colostomy bag.  A female caller, Edith, engaged in a lengthy, sexually suggestive phone conversation with the hosts.  Commercial breaks included ads for Rockaway Bedding, Sam Adams beer, and Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  The discussion also included numerous references to the movie *Little Nicky*.  Racial slurs and homophobic language were frequently used, contributing to the overall tone of unrestrained vulgarity and chaotic energy.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  W. Ben E. W. now concludes its broadcast day.  Stay tuned for W. O. N. A. on 1027 WNEW.  Break it down!  We love seeing books.  We love it.  Yes.  Oh yeah, yeah. Everybody can run around the street.  They're close up.  What's the world's wedding day?  A brilliant idea.  Where's the cure for cancer?  Your injury!  Yes.  O. B. N. N. 
[00:00:30]  O. B. N. 
[00:01:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Yes.  Yes.  A little chilly out there, but that's okay.  Ladies, you know what to do if you feel like it.  Show us what you got as the guys drive home from work today.  Yeah.  What did Ben play?  What were his songs?  Little Fat Boy and Beck.  You're getting slammed, Ben.  Are you reading your reviews and getting all upset?  No, this jerk off Max didn't like it, but the rest of them did. 
[00:01:30]  A lot of other people did.  Okay.  Max is probably one of those guys who can't get, you know, up in his little hairband.  It's just like 10,000 times.  Ben really takes pride in his little show.  Of course he does.  So he doesn't like when people really give him bad reviews.  But he reads every one.  Nothing wrong with playing a little Fat Boy Sliv and a little Beck before our little radio show.  Oh, my God.  I'm a wreck.  I'm a wreck today.  I think I have a problem, just like Ben. 
[00:02:00]  We went out to our bar nine last night, you know?  You always playing?  Oh.  Well, you know once Lynch and Dina Cola show up, and you look around and you see Jim Norton's there, too?  Right.  It just got ugly.  Degenerated really quick.  Had a great time, but I can't do that every week.  But you do it every week.  I didn't do it last week.  Well, you took a Tuesday off.  I know.  It was a lot of fun.  Showing a little restraint.  Took one Tuesday off.  Good.  That's good. 
[00:02:30]  We're in the middle of hell in your party.  Why not?  Hell yeah.  Yeah, now Max yelling at you through the answer of feedback.  Screw you, Ben.  Woo-hoo.  All right, yeah.  It's Whippin' Wow Wednesday.  So, guys, please put the WOW bumper stickers on your car if you have them, or you can make the homemade WOW signs.  We love the homemade WOW signs still.  See a lot of them.  I love that more than the bumper stickers, because you know that guy made a little effort. 
[00:03:00]  Did a little something to hopefully see something on the way home from work today.  You know what I saw in Brooklyn the other day, Opie?  A WOW window cling.  Stuck on someone's side window.  I'm like, wow.  That's a collector's item.  Guy better take that off and put it in his house.  Someone might steal it.  It's a collector's item.  Absolutely.  And we're doing a WOW sticker stop today at 4 o'clock with Shrek, a.k.a. Black Earl.  Shrek.  At Meadowlands Ford in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 
[00:03:30]  So join Shrek at Meadowlands Ford in East Rutherford, New Jersey, starting at 4 if you don't have a WOW bumper sticker yet, okay?  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, great.  Now we're here to do a radio show.  Yes.  Today, uh, what day is it?  It's day zero.  I don't know.  Tomorrow's our last day of our contract.  Right.  That's it.  It's about to be joined.  We should have just a cake party tomorrow.  We should. 
[00:04:00]  Just throw a cake party and invite everyone that's ever been on this radio show tonight.  Come down.  Come down and just get hammered.  Get a little ugly.  Yeah.  The only time we get away from, uh, contract negotiations is to do a radio show.  On the air.  That's about it.  Everything else is, uh, taken up with the contract.  My phone starts ringing at 7 in the morning and doesn't stop ringing until, like, 10 to 3.  Mm-hmm.  And it's all BS.  Yeah.  Now I'm finding out that, uh, if WNW feels like it, they can force us to work here. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, I know.  It's the latest.  Yeah, that seems to be, uh, something that's in a contract somewhere.  That was...  I don't remember signing that.  That was thrown around today.  Yeah.  I hear that, um, Ken Stevens can, uh, pick one of us each day to have anal with.  That's in the contract.  And for some reason, we've signed it.  That's the latest.  That just pisses me right to F off.  After three years of not being taken care of here at WNW, now I'm finding out that they  could force us to continue.  If they feel like it. 
[00:05:00]  Those would be interesting shows, though.  Those would be really shows under duress.  Or both of them.  Yeah, both of them.  That would be just the F-U-F-U-F-U show.  The F-U-C show.  Right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, would you guys stop bitching about the, uh, contract negotiations?  It's been a half hour every day.  Uh, John, I...  Wow.  Okay.  I guess you had to hit the dump button, huh?  Yeah, I had to hit the dump button, because it's not true. 
[00:05:30]  We didn't even mention the contract yesterday.  Okay, you took one day off.  No, no, no, we didn't mention it Friday or last Thursday.  We only mentioned it once last week.  Take some gold off, you know?  No, get your facts straight.  Okay.  We allow you guys to, you know, battle with us, but get your facts straight.  It's not true.  It's not true.  I'm sorry, Opie, please forgive me.  Blow me. 
[00:06:00]  They're out of your mind.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  What a douche.  Yeah.  Get your facts straight.  And, yeah, tomorrow's our last day of, uh, contracts.  Yeah, we won't talk about our contract negotiations.  Here's the deal.  It's not going anywhere, and we have a day left on our contracts.  What do you guys think we should talk about today?  Check.  And now they're playing hardball, because we're not happy still, and they're, like, saying,  well, you know what? 
[00:06:30]  We could, uh, force you to stay here.  That doesn't make me happy today.  That makes Opie potty mouth, is what it makes them.  Makes them potty mouth.  So let's just sit here and make believe we're having fun.  Well, we'll blast their smiles on our faces and plow through this S one more time.  I didn't need to hear, you know, they could force us to stay here.  Yeah.  What the F is that?  I don't know.  They had three years to take care of us.  They did nothing.  Nothing.  Turns out someone else very interested in our radio show, now they jump like crazy running 
[00:07:00]  around with their heads chopped off to try to make us happy.  They had three years to do it.  And now they don't like it, you know, they don't like the fact that someone else is interested  in us, and now they're pulling out this card saying, well, we could force you to stay here  if we feel like it.  Yeah.  According to the contract that you signed.  By the way, I saw Ken in the hall, and he wants to know, reservations for where tonight? 
[00:07:30]  So we might want to get back to him with that.  Yeah, reservations for my ass.  Oh, my God.  I've just about had it, I swear to God.  Carmine, what's going on?  It's Carmen, you dildo.  Whatever.  Everyone's potty mouth today.  You're a little screaming queen.  Whatever.  What do you got?  I remember.  That's all you do.  You do talk about it every day, and we're tired of hearing you why.  I remember this woman.  Oh, because she hates us, but she listens.  You're my black ass, right? 
[00:08:00]  She hates us, but she listens every day.  You're the black twat that hates us and listens every day.  I'm the black twat that's whiter than your Puerto Rican girlfriend.  And what is that supposed to mean?  I'm the black twat that's whiter than your Puerto Rican girlfriend.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's exactly it.  You get it?  No, I don't.  No.  There's potty mouth all over today.  You people.  Man, this is going to be interesting.  It's only 3-11.  You've got to be eight minutes into it.  I know.  We've already dumped out of half the show. 
[00:08:30]  That's five dumps in the first couple of minutes.  Oh.  Anthony, what's going on?  Not too much, Hopi.  How are you?  Oh, sorry.  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Listen, I just wanted to say, you know, after these other guys, man, that don't want to hear about the contract,  I mean, this is the most important thing right now.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  No, I don't want to.  I, for one, don't want to see you guys leave.  And I'm sick of reading crap that's saying this is all, like, you know, it's all BS.  They're going to stay right where they are.  Well, you know what?  Just like all the other high-profile jocks, you know, this is just what they do. 
[00:09:00]  You know what?  It's not true at all.  I would leave this place tomorrow if they would let me.  I'm sick of this crap.  I mean, I really hope you guys don't because the rest of the station is going to just, you know, completely suck if you guys leave.  Well, who the hell in their right mind would just turn around and say, you know,  we could force them to stay and work at WNAW if we feel like it?  No, that's crazy.  That's supposed to make us happy and supposed to listen to what they want to offer us now?  No.  Tell me.  Well, I mean, you guys are doing a great job, so, I mean, I hope you guys don't leave. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, I definitely don't want to see you leave.  And a smart move telling us at 2.30 today that that's what they can do if they feel like it.  That's when you found out?  No, that'll really blow.  All right, Anthony.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Yeah, it's all a bit.  Can you tell in my voice?  Jesus.  What are you standing up for?  You're scaring me.  You're going to throw something.  I'm just taking my fleece off. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, this is a bad mood, man.  You're in one nasty-ass mood today.  It's just amazing.  It's just amazing what the crap we've had to put up with for the last three years.  Yeah.  Oh, well, let's not dwell on what happened in the past and look for the future.  Look toward the future.  Well, yeah.  First day of the future, I hear. 
[00:10:30]  Well, we could force you to work here if we feel like it, according to the contract you signed three years ago.  I don't remember that little line.  I thought I read over it thoroughly.  It must have been on that legalese that I don't understand.  God, if you wanted us to stay here so much, why wait until like two weeks before we're out of here to start figuring out how to make us happy?  Yeah.  Well, we sure know how to get fired, I'll be.  So we always have that to fault. 
[00:11:00]  We're really good at that.  I think there's a few politicians out there that are feeling a little sick, a little sickly, or maybe perhaps might be involved in some kind of a crash of sorts.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Well, whether you realize it or not, these negotiations are very much like the Godfather.  You guys are Michael Corleone.  You're taking over.  The show is the family.  And the whole negotiation process is a christening.  And once you guys resign, you take out everyone that was holding back the family. 
[00:11:30]  I'll ponder that one for a while.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Thank you, Rolf.  No, it's the number for the White House.  We could call up the White House and not ask for permission.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony.  Did you take Bruce to the manhole last night?  No.  Boy.  No, our old GM from Boston.  You didn't see any shwoogies, huh?  No.  I think the only shwoogies are dating his daughter. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, guys.  Blow me in the air.  All right, guys.  All right.  We had to dump out of him, Mike.  No.  No, we took our old boss to the Hudson Hotel.  Yeah.  For some drinks and some food.  And some attitude.  A little attitude.  You have fun.  He's a good guy.  No, there's attitude in the place.  Not your attitude.  It's all right.  Yeah.  And we were reminiscing about the past.  Mm-hmm.  He told us some stuff we forgot all about.  Yeah.  When he was accused of being anti-Semite. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  He's like the most Jewish guy you're ever going to see.  He lived in Snuton, of all places.  And Juton, they call him.  They call it Juton, right?  Juton.  An anti-Semite boy.  No, I mean, he was constantly getting in trouble because of the things the jocks were doing on the air.  Yeah.  And he was called an anti-Semite.  Yeah.  So he went on the air and had to tell the listeners of WAF at the time that he lost relatives in the Holocaust. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  That his relatives died to prove that he wasn't an anti-Semite.  But I have to, I can't believe I have to get on the air and talk about my dead relatives from the Holocaust.  But I don't keep being called an anti-Semite lightly.  Bill, what's going on?  Hey, I've been listening to you guys for a really long time. 
[00:13:30]  The first time I heard you guys, you were ragging on Dave Herman.  And you had his wife on the phone.  Yeah.  And I want to know, if you guys leave, will you guys be able to be picked up here by us?  Will we be able to hear you wherever you go?  We will be in New York without a doubt.  All right.  I'm not worried about that.  And, oh, big surprise.  We'll finally get syndicated because we forced everyone's hand.  Nice.  Even though it was something we wanted three years ago. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We wanted it two years ago.  We wanted it a year ago.  We wanted it six months ago.  We wanted it three months ago.  But, you know, but we had to force their hand.  And now they understand how important syndication is to us.  Where's the?  In my ass.  We could have a tossed salad.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  I want to say something.  The Facebook listeners do care about your contract. 
[00:14:30]  They want to hear what's going on.  This is no bid.  We don't know.  We'll give it to us.  We can turn the radio off if you don't want to hear it.  Now they want to, like, try to sign us to a day-to-day contract or something.  No, I stopped working after tomorrow.  That's it.  I'm told it's figured out.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, bye.  We're going to have a sick out.  We might have to work Friday because I think officially that is.  I don't even know.  I think that's our last day.  And then I'm sitting out.  Then they can figure it out.  Thirty-first is our last day.  Okay.  The thirty-first.  Then they possibly force us to continue working here. 
[00:15:00]  What are they going to do?  Come to our house with armed guards and, like, throw us in a police car and then just work?  And handcuff us to the, you know, to the studio every day?  Like little Taiwanese children handcuffed to the little benches making shirts.  You know, slave labor.  You will get to work.  They had to remind us of that today.  You've got to be kidding me.  Jerry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to remind you guys, there's a morning show in New York. 
[00:15:30]  I think they're still looking to hire a head writer in case you guys need a job at the end of this week.  No, that's okay.  No?  All right.  I don't worry.  Thanks for the last three years, guys.  All right, bye.  It has nothing to do with needing a job.  And it has nothing to do with, it's been a nice three year.  You'll hear us, regardless of what happens.  You look at your butt. 
[00:16:00]  Mario, what's going on?  I didn't know your old boss, your boss, your boss.  What?  Boy.  I know you.  Yeah.  I didn't call for this purpose, but now you got me fired up, too.  Listen, if you're so visible with your job for the past three years, which you're always seen to be,  why don't you just step off?  We're in a contract, and we were hoping that it was going to get better.  It wasn't that bad.  We were able to, like, you know, do what we love to do, a radio show.  We were very successful at it. 
[00:16:30]  So after your contract's up tomorrow, just go home.  But in the meantime, why don't you just take the high road?  Do what you guys have paid to do, which is to entertain us.  Mario, we've been taking the high road for a very long time.  Yeah, come on, man.  All came aside, I'm not busting your top.  I know.  The last two weeks, you guys just moan and moan and moan.  Mario, because we don't know where we're going to be.  Who cares?  I don't know where I'm going to be tomorrow.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  And Mario, hold on, hold on.  You don't have to listen to this, Cole.  Come on.  Exactly.  But let me ask you something.  But you do, right?  So you're interested a little bit.  Listen to me.  I'm interested a little bit because this is entertainment. 
[00:17:00]  It's like you have entertainment, too.  And listen to me.  I don't know what you're saying.  When there's something on your show or any show, I turn it off.  I come back later.  If there's a bit that's going on that I don't like, I turn it off.  But, Mario, you don't really understand what's going on here, okay?  For the last two weeks, we have no clue where we're going to be broadcasting from, okay?  We have put on hold everything.  Everything.  We have a lot of ideas.  We want to do a comedy rock and roll show at a huge venue.  We want to do a bikini softball game.  All this stuff is on hold. 
[00:17:30]  Our lives are on hold.  Nothing is going on.  And we haven't planned a thing for the summer.  We talk about stuff like, hey, you know, we're going to be teasing the fact that we're going to be giving away announcement tickets soon.  But we don't even know if we're going to be here to do that even.  Opie, I'm with you.  I understand what you're saying.  But listen to me.  Your fans, you supposedly treat your fans like your friends.  You do all these road shows.  You make like everybody's one big happy family.  Now, if you're just hanging out with your buddies at a bar and they're doing the same thing you're doing,  you think you'd sit there for three weeks straight and listen to them? 
[00:18:00]  That's why you'd say, pal.  Mario, if you don't want to listen, that's fine.  But I don't know what else to tell you because...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Whatever you say on the air, whatever you say on the air, it's not going to change the situation.  Mario, what are we supposed to do?  You know what we were supposed to be doing the last couple of weeks talking about our softball game?  That was supposed to happen.  Let's talk about it.  That was supposed to happen June 9th.  You don't get it.  Let's go set the date.  We don't have a date, Jack, because we don't know if we're going to be here. 
[00:18:30]  Holy...  Guys, you suck it up.  Be a man.  What is it going to take for you to listen?  This guy's thick.  Me?  He's thick.  Mario.  You guys are bitches, man.  Just be a man about it.  You don't have to smile when you're getting a high, hard one.  No, I can smile through that stuff, but what I'm trying to tell Mario is that we can't talk about the stuff that makes this show great because we don't know if we're going to be here. 
[00:19:00]  We have things planned that...  You know what?  Do dice for five minutes.  Do dice for five minutes.  Finally.  I wasn't even going to be partied of that call.  That guy was just annoying.  He doesn't quite get it, is what I think.  Well, he pissed him more than anybody.  He's the guy whining.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, suck it up.  Suck this.  Suck it up.  Just lap it up. 
[00:19:30]  We...  Tim, what's going on?  Guys, what's up?  Hey.  Anybody who knows the show knows you guys are going to do whatever you want to do, and you know what?  F everybody else.  You guys can get in the ram, rod, the short rod, whatever you want to call for the longest time.  S management.  And I have to interrupt you again, okay?  There are some high-profile people in this company, and they're, you know, I will protect their integrity, and I'll protect their jobs and stuff, so I won't mention their names.  They have told me to my face that this company has screwed us. 
[00:20:00]  And these are higher-ups in this...  And they have, and they're absolutely correct.  These are higher-ups in this company.  Higher-ups.  They admitted to me.  They said, you guys have been screwed over by this company that I've enjoyed working for for the last 20 years.  Oops, did I say 20 years?  Well, actually, Opie, the point I was going to make is if they do send the cops for you yelling and screaming on Friday, just whip out your trusty ONA PBA card.  That'll get you off.  That'll get you off.  All right?  You guys rock. 
[00:20:30]  I thought I made it.  We'll hear you guys again.  No, I didn't make it.  To that douche that thought he was teaching me a lesson, I got out of my ticket, you dick.  Oh, my God.  You better watch your ass, man.  I was all cocky.  Ooh, I pulled over Opie.  I don't give a crap.  I'm not talking about that.  You don't want to get anyone else in trouble.  Whatever.  That's all I'm saying.  Really, when you think about it.  Who won that one?  I did make it through.  Told you I made it.  Holy shit. 
[00:21:00]  What?  What?  What?  What?  This is why you're always getting tickets and not getting tickets.  I don't care.  At least I'm being me.  Who cares?  And I haven't had a ticket in many years.  My record is still intact.  Ticket free for the last three years.  You are really in some mood today. 
[00:21:30]  You are really in some mood.  I think everyone would agree.  Oh, my God.  Fear, sweet Jesus Christ.  Hey, Ken admitted.  He said, hey, you know, your agent's going to piss you off today.  He told me that at 2.30.  Well, Ken, guess what?  You're right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You got to deal with it at 7 o'clock. 
[00:22:00]  It's just a little four hours that, you know, we don't really have to deal with it.  Kit, what's going on?  Hi.  Hey.  I was just wondering, I listened to you guys for, like, a really long time.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  Like, they're going to, like, get rid of you or you don't like the contract that they're giving you?  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Let me put on my flak jacket, my helmet.  I'm going to crawl into the bunker first, and then you'll get an answer.  And wait, and I also...  Wait, Kit, how long have you been listening to our show? 
[00:22:30]  Probably two years.  And did you pay attention at all during the last two years?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't get to listen to you from, like...  Did you pick up on anything?  Did you pick up on...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally, totally.  Did you pick up on our frustration and...  Absolutely.  And, you know, us being censored and not being able to talk about anyone else in our company...  Yes.  ...and how we wanted to be syndicated and for some reason we couldn't be syndicated because we were bad boys and always getting in trouble.  But as they said that, you know, the rates for our show went through the roof and we made them a lot of money. 
[00:23:00]  Okay.  Now our contracts are up, okay?  Right.  It's no secret.  Someone out there really, really likes the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  They really, really like us.  Right.  And it's like, hmm, wow.  Someone that may take care of us and see us for what we are.  But can I ask you a question?  See that we're on the way up and, you know, maybe they can make some money, you know, from us and also help out our careers.  Right.  So then we turn to the old company that, quite frankly, showed they didn't care for the last three years and told them, hey, look at this. 
[00:23:30]  This new chick really likes us.  But wait.  Now they're running around trying to make us happy finally.  Right.  But.  And they don't understand why we're not ready to run down the hall and sign, you know, this 700 to 800 page contract.  All right.  But aren't you owned by the same company as your biggest competitor in the morning?  Yeah.  Okay.  So isn't it obvious that you're probably very successful, like your numbers are really high, that he obviously did well in syndication. 
[00:24:00]  Why wouldn't they just syndicate you?  Good question.  Why don't you go ask him?  Because we've been asking that question for three years.  Oh, okay.  And I also have another question.  Is Anthony, Anthony, is his divorce final?  No, it goes on.  Oh, and is he still dating the young girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else?  And, yeah.  Do you guys ever see Spaz? 
[00:24:30]  No.  No.  Okay.  Anything else?  He emails us every once in a while.  You're a big mouth.  You got a big mouth.  All right, kid.  Thank you.  Okay.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Bye.  Did you finally get the carpet cleaned?  How's that new paint?  Is Opie's head ready to explode?  Wow.  Yeah.  Ha.  Talking to Andy Rooney.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Fantastic.  Wow.  That was a rough half hour.  Yeah, I know.  I'm stunned.  Stunned?  You're hungover.  I'm fine.  I work great when I'm hungover.  All right.  Not that bad. 
[00:25:30]  My voice is shot from singing.  We will move on.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes.

[00:28:30]  What, what, what, yeah?  Boy, that was a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  What, what, what happened?  So we were all just having fun, right?  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medication's on water.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Oh, well.  All right, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. 
[00:29:00]  This place blows.  You've got to be careful with your sound effects.  Why?  Because they take that personally now, too.  Do they?  Yeah.  That was a recording of me a couple of Fridays ago.  I was told that.  They take it personally.  Really?  Sweet, merciful crap!  Yeah, that's good.  What the hell were you thinking?  The carpet, my kids. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's move on here.  If we can.  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  You are absolutely priceless today.  Just hearing you on hold was the funniest thing I've heard all week.  10 dumps so far.  S, S, S, S, S, S.  I will set the dump record today.  Oh.  Keep it going.  If that douchebag Glenn Jones could set the DJ.  Wow, I'm on the air the longest. 
[00:30:00]  100 hours.  Care.  He looked like a complete tool.  He couldn't even walk out of his own studio after setting the Guinness Book of World Records  of being on the air the longest.  He was playing records for 100 straight hours.  Yeah.  And he's proud of that and everyone's talking to him.  Who cares?  It's not hard to play records.  They had to carry him just about out of the office, out of the studios.  He had two guys, one on each arm, dragging him out of the studio.  And he looked like he had run a marathon. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  You stayed up.  What, did he sprain his wrist from pushing all those buttons for 100 straight hours?  Oh.  Hey, did you guys see that Dax chopper crash on TV?  Oh, yeah.  The Korean chopper?  Yeah, the Dax.  They're done as Koreans for short.  Oh, my God.  That thing.  Oh, boy.  They bought the farm in a big way.  I did not see that footage yet.  Yeah, it looks pretty intense.  There's a helicopter.  It was one of those twin rotor ones. 
[00:31:00]  It's got the two rotors on top.  And they were trying to rescue some guy off a bridge.  And they lost power.  The thing drops about 50 feet.  And one of the rotors just taps the bridge.  And that's it.  It's over.  And it burst into flames when it hit the bridge.  Well, before that, both the rotors started hitting each other.  And it lost both the rotors.  It falls another 200 feet on top of the bridge and blows up.  Yeah.  And knowing you, that made your day.  It made my day.  Oh, he calls up. 
[00:31:30]  He calls up the studio.  And all you hear is,  God, do you see that goop top that goes down?  That, that, that.  Wow, wow, wow.  He's wow.  It's too bad that A.W. management wasn't on that chopper, huh?  Jesus Christ.  They take that stuff.  Like, I'm going to get my chop back.  Oh, Mark, that has been discussed, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  I can just keep draining.  But you shouldn't say that,  because they take all this stuff personally now, 
[00:32:00]  even though we're, yeah,  still trying to entertain our fine, faithful listeners.  Right.  Imagine Ken Stevens on that chopper.  What would he be saying?  Uh, ah.  Oh, jeez.  All right, Mac.  All right, I've got to go before I get in any more trouble.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's too late.  Too late.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ralph from Stanford wants his record.  He said he watched TV for 48 straight hours over the weekend.  Where's my press coverage?  That's pretty much what the guy did. 
[00:32:30]  He listened to music.  Oh, yeah, he had to play it a little bit.  Been at parties that last that long,  and someone had to change his CDs.  You know?  It's not like a big four-day party.  There's too many rules  when he tried to set a Guinness Book of World Records.  He had a 15-minute bathroom break every eight hours.  Right.  That means he could take 15-minute catnaps.  Every eight hours.  Which certainly helps  when you're trying to stay awake for four straight days.  He had to announce every song.  Ooh.  And he couldn't play songs longer than six minutes  or shorter than two minutes. 
[00:33:00]  And that's what he did.  Or, what, four days?  Whatever it was?  Yeah.  What a guy.  Try to do a four-hour talk show  without talking bad about the place you work  or your bosses.  Now that's a challenge.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh.  I'm going to try to last at least five minutes now  without doing either.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Take a stab at it.  See what happens.  Can someone please tell me  what happened to Christopher Reeve's eyebrows?  Um, he's paralyzed.  I understand that, 
[00:33:30]  but why is he losing his eyebrows?  They keep rubbing against the mattress.  Oh, God.  He tries to roll over.  Trying to get up.  He can try to get up,  but only with his eyes.  He was...  That might be what it is, though.  He's laying in bed face down going,  Oh, Christ, I can't roll over.  Let me try to do it with my eyelids.  Er, er, er.  Um, I'll raise and lower my eyebrows.  There's got...  There has to be an explanation, though.  His head popped up on the tube.  I guess it was yesterday,  and quite frankly,  I was scared to death. 
[00:34:00]  What happened to his eyebrows?  That poor guy.  I mean, it's really tragic and sad,  but all of a sudden,  he has no eyebrows.  I guess they just came out somehow.  Somebody played a cruel joke on him  while we were sitting there.  You think his wife just...  Shaved someone?  You think someone shaved a pill?  Maybe it was, like, you know,  pulling around on his wife  all those years  when he was walking around,  and now his wife is getting him back  by shaving his eyebrows.  Hey, stop it.  Taking duct tape and just...  Don't make me spit at you. 
[00:34:30]  I'll do it.  Marion.  Marion, hey.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How are you doing?  This Marion.  Jesus.  Hey, guys.  Hi, troll.  Hey, I've been hearing  that you guys are thinking  about leaving.  Please, guys,  don't go anywhere.  All right, I'm sold.  Please, me and Lady Diane  hope you guys don't go anywhere.  We're hoping.  You there?  Yeah.  I love your character  in EverQuest. 
[00:35:00]  No, really, guys.  We've been hearing this show.  We don't know  if you guys are for real  or whatever,  but we just want to  let you know  that hopefully  whatever you guys do,  you do it for the best.  Right.  And we want you to stay.  Marion.  What?  Do you honestly think...  Now, you've got  so-called kind of brain, right?  Yes.  Do you honestly think  that what you say  has any bearing  whatsoever  on what we do?  No, but you have  a lot of fans  and I have...  Marion, Marion. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Use your sober,  come pray.  Use it.  Do you absolutely think  it has any,  any impact  on whatever decision  we make,  what you say, right?  No, but I think  I heard the first  10 minutes of the show,  Anthony,  and I heard it at work.  I heard other people  going...  Marion.  Yeah?  What did we say  the first 10 minutes  of the show?  Very curious to see.  That you're talking...  I heard a little bit  that you're talking  about whatever's going  on with your contract,  which is none  of my business,  but I heard somebody 
[00:36:00]  saying,  growing up,  saying don't leave, guys.  If it was none  of your business,  why were you listening?  Because I listened  to your show  all the time.  Well, if it was  none of your business...  And whatever you guys...  No, I just want  to let you know  that hopefully you guys  stay, whatever goes on,  hopefully you guys stay.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Because me and me  and I would like  to pop up there eventually,  but we don't know when.  Oh, all right.  Pop up like whack-a-mole.  Well, we don't know when.  Like a whack-a-mole game.  But maybe I would like  to come up here soon.  I don't know.  Weren't you supposed 
[00:36:30]  to come by with your  summer bathing suit  so we can check them out?  Yeah.  Oh, that's in July.  No, summer is now.  Come on.  Yeah, but that's in July  because I'm losing weight.  And if I buy  a bathing suit now,  I'm going to buy  another one in July.  What, you only buy  one per summer?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I haven't  worn one in years,  but knowing that  I'm losing weight,  I mean, you know,  I'm not going to buy  one now.  I'm buying one  another month from now.  So now we have  to wait until July  to see you  in your bathing suit? 
[00:37:00]  Well, if you guys  are still around, yeah.  Hopefully you guys are.  All right.  You know, hey, O.D.,  Anthony, I know...  I was waiting for that.  I was so waiting for that.  Tommy, what's going on?  Pop up like a  cesspaloma float.  The only way Marion  loses that much weight  is if she gets breast cancer  and loses a breast  with him.  Oh, disgusting.  Oh, dude,  I saw the Christopher Reeve thing.  Were you frightened  by the fact  he has no eyebrows anymore?  He looks like  Fire Marshal Bill now.  He has a...  I'll guess I'm not...  He's got like a  tough appearance 
[00:37:30]  in front of his head, too.  He must have...  It must be like a vice grip  holding his head  in the wheelchair.  It's disgusting.  I'm going to pop  his picture up right here  because I really want  to take a look.  Oh, my God.  He looks...  Oh, that's awful.  Wait, turn around.  I'll tell you  if that's the latest  picture or not.  I understand he's deteriorating.  He's getting older.  He's little pale-skinned.  No, Anthony.  No, that's him  looking normal  in a wheelchair.  Where's the other one?  You have got to see  the latest picture  of Christopher Reeves.  It's really sad.  I'm not going to lie to you,  but I want to know  where his eyebrows went.  Super bad.  Looks like he has 
[00:38:00]  leukemia or something there.  That's what I was thinking.  Maybe it was getting  some radiation treatment  or something.  Nasty.  I don't know.  Good luck, guys.  All right, Tommy.  If someone could find  the latest picture  of Christopher Reeves,  I'm talking like  from yesterday.  He's all pissed off.  Or today.  It might have even been today.  Yeah, today.  He's really annoyed,  Christopher Reeves.  Look at him.  Where is he?  Holy...  Oh, get out of here.  That's not him.  That's what I'm telling you.  Dude.  This has been  some serious deterioration  in the last few months.  Whoa.  Let me see. 
[00:38:30]  God damn.  Captain Christopher Pike.  He looks like  Captain Christopher Pike.  Looks like a cross  between a fire marshal Bill  and that creature thing  from The Silence of the Lambs.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell  was that guy's name?  It looks like  the picture's smudged.  Oh, my God.  It's sad.  Yeah.  Carolyn's got a theory  on his eyebrows.  Carolyn, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I have a theory.  Maybe,  and I'm not looking 
[00:39:00]  at the picture right now,  but, you know,  he's definitely  had gray hair,  so they dye the hair  on his head.  Maybe they're not  dyeing the hair  on his eyebrows  and this is gray.  You just can't see them  in the pictures.  Carolyn, man,  there's nothing there.  It's scary.  There's no eyebrows there.  The hair on his head  is really, like,  just thin.  Yeah, his hair  is really thin,  but his skin  looks plastic now, too.  Yeah.  He's probably not wearing,  like, the base foundation  makeup that, you know,  you used to see him  when he was famous.  This, he doesn't  even look...  He's a mannequin.  Yeah.  He's all glossy. 
[00:39:30]  He's doing a comb-over  with what little hair.  He's got, like,  Giuliani hair now.  Right.  It's sad.  Aw, poor bastard.  You know,  someone's got to tell him  he's never walking again, too.  I mean, yeah,  he's really, uh,  he's all pissed off now  because they're not doing  that stem cell research.  I think the Republicans  are pulling out of that  because it involves  using embryos  and leftover aborted fetuses  and stuff,  and you know how  the Republicans love that.  So, uh,  they're stopping the research  with that,  and it's very important 
[00:40:00]  to him to do  this kind of research  because he might just  get up and walk someday  if they keep doing  this research, Opie.  Well, it's, yeah,  it's important for anyone  that has a spinal cord injury,  they're saying,  and with the stem cell research,  you know,  some of these people  can be walking  the next 10 years,  but because of the politics  and stuff,  someone's got to tell  Christopher Reeves  he's never walking again.  I don't think so.  It's good to have a goal  and stuff,  but I think,  a goal.  Hey.  It's not like,  I want to get my golf game down  kind of goal.  A goal.  That's his goal?  He's made a goal. 
[00:40:30]  It's a goal.  I'm walking again.  That's his goal.  I can understand  when you see some people  at the therapy centers  and they're kind of walking,  you know,  and they're working it  and it's like,  all right, maybe.  Maybe.  But Christopher Reeves  has been in that chair  for years now.  Hey, what's going to happen?  Will, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, we look at  that new wax museum  in Manhattan, right?  Yeah.  They got Christopher Reeves  wax figure in a wheelchair.  Oh, could you use  the guy's wax figure 
[00:41:00]  standing up?  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't have eyebrows  in a wheelchair, man.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, a load of laughs.  Yeah, why couldn't they  put him, like,  in a Superman outfit?  Right.  Or did they put  the wrong picture in him?  All right, well, thank you.  Who could that possibly be?  What, the wax figure?  Is that what they'll say?  Maybe that's the wax figure  from that.  That would be funny  if they did that by accident.  They weren't done  making it yet.  They hadn't put in  all the hair  and given the skin tone  a natural hue. 
[00:41:30]  Terry, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Terry.  Hey, I'm looking  at Jenna Bush.  I love this little hose bag.  You know, every establishment  and everybody's got  their village idiot.  Yeah.  You know, you had  Clinton and his brother,  you know, sex and drugs.  Uh-huh.  And you think back,  you had Billy Carter.  Jimmy Carter's, yeah.  He's going to be  the Billy Carter  of the Bush administration.  Reagan had his daughter  and his gay son.  Yeah.  What's the latest  with Jenna Bush?  She's buying alcohol 
[00:42:00]  last night in a restaurant  with a fake ID in Texas.  The president's daughter  in Texas using a fake ID.  Nobody knows me.  I live in Texas.  My father is the,  you know, the president.  The leader of the free world.  Don't mind the guy  behind the curtain,  the Secret Service guy  watching me.  I'm just trying  to buy some booze.  Well, if the Secret Service  guy was cool,  he would buy her her booze.  Exactly.  Screwed.  I mean, but you make it  sound like it's outrageous  what she's doing.  We all try to buy booze  before we were of age.  Oh, I don't have a problem 
[00:42:30]  with her trying to buy it.  It's just who she is  with a fake ID in public.  She's a chick  off the old drunk.  She really is.  This chick loves her booze  just like daddy.  You know, Anheuser-Busch  is going to endorse her.  I've got a bush in your hand  and Jenna in the other.  She's 19.  She's pretty hot.  Yeah.  And she loves boozing it up.  Exactly.  She's got to be an easy lay.  Oh.  She's got that  get back at daddy thing.  You know what I mean?  She's got that  get back at daddy thing  like Bruce Mittman's  daughter, Opie,  that he told us  about last night.  Poor Bruce.  All right, Terry. 
[00:43:00]  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  That was funny last night.  Bruce was like,  well, like,  how are the kids?  It's like,  well, my son,  Andrew,  doing very well, boys.  He's an aspiring director.  He's made some short films  that have won awards.  Like, oh,  how's Emily doing?  Well, she comes home  with her Puerto Rican  and shwoogie boyfriends  to upset her father.  I hope he just went,  ooh,  ooh,  ow.  Poor Bruce.  John,  what's going on?  Hey,  it's like a revert 
[00:43:30]  to Superman 4.  I think Christopher Reeves  is finally feeling the impact  and fighting that radiation guy.  Oh.  Yeah,  it was a mess.  Ouch.  It was a movie.  All right, John,  thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Oh,  imagine now.  You couldn't even get away  from kryptonite.  You just come,  bring it right towards him.  Like,  oh,  I can't roll away.  Time to check in  at our WOW sticker stop.  It's happening at  Meadowlands Ford  in East Rutherford,  New Jersey.  Make it sound exciting, Earl.  On the phone,  it's Shrek.  Shrek! 
[00:44:00]  Shrek!  Earl!  Earl!  So he's got a problem  because we call him Shrek,  I'm assuming.  Is that it?  It did sound like  the phone was fine.  It didn't sound like  a bad sound.  But now he's calling back  and he's going to say,  guys,  I couldn't hear you.  I didn't hear you.  It was his little way.  Earl!  Yo!  What's up?  Yo, guys,  we're at 330 County Avenue  in Sakakis  for a WOW sticker stop. 
[00:44:30]  I love it.  Earl.  In a beautiful  Meadowlands Ford.  Earl, Earl.  Yo!  I want you to be honest with me.  Yo!  The first time you called,  right?  Did you or did you  not hear us  talking to you?  I heard you.  We were breaking up.  You're such a liar.  You don't like  being called Shrek?  I mean,  do you want to just  talk about it a little bit?  Earl.  Earl.  Hey, Earl.  Yeah.  Can we paint you green  like Shrek?  Let's see what you look like. 
[00:45:00]  That's not racist or nothing.  It's not white.  It's not white face.  Right.  No, he'll do.  We might have to use  two coats.  We want to paint you green  and see how much  you look like Shrek.  No.  No.  Why?  No, I don't like  the nickname.  Why don't you like  the nickname?  You think I...  I like being called  something that's green  and blue and dark.  I love that.  Yeah.  Wow.  Earl, it's not your body.  It's the face. 
[00:45:30]  There's some similarities.  Shrek was a cute little  little character  in that movie.  Look, you got the chick  in the end.  Get her in the end.  What?  He's an ogre,  but I'm not talking  about your body.  Earl, are you okay?  Phone fell between his legs.  Earl.  Yeah.  What's the problem  by us calling you Shrek  every once in a while?  Why?  I just don't like it.  You think I like being  called Opie?  I mean, my 30, 
[00:46:00]  for Christ's sake.  I got the name  when I was like 12.  I'm not happy.  Things happen.  It's kind of cute.  Shrek.  Hey, where are the  white women at?  The movie will go away  and then people  will forget about Shrek  and you'll come back  to your regular name.  Right.  What do you think?  I think it's endearing.  You don't like anything  we do with you  on this show.  I can safely say that,  right?  He does not like  anything we do  that involves him 
[00:46:30]  on this program.  Earl,  name one thing you like  that we made you do.  I can't think of anything  off the top of my head.  You didn't like  when we tried  to paint you white,  right?  I didn't want to be.  That was just funny.  It's about as funny  as a fart in church.  That is pretty funny  if you're sitting  in church  and all of a sudden  I'd laugh my balls off  so it kind of  doesn't work, Earl.  It is kind of funny.  It's really funny.  Earl,  and I said I would,  you know, 
[00:47:00]  I'd go blackface  if you went whiteface.  So now we're talking  just painting you green  to see how much  you look like Shrek.  Thanks.  No, thanks.  We're going to get  those weird ears,  those funnel ear things.  Yeah.  We'll give you  some funnel ears  and some antennae.  No, I don't have that.  No?  What do you want  on this Earl head?  Earl,  I begged for you today  because of that  whole phone incident.  Oh, really?  Yeah?  What happened?  Earl? 
[00:47:30]  Earl,  you know that, right?  Yes, I know that.  And they also said  they didn't want to,  you know,  have you go to  the WOW sticker stuff  today, didn't they?  Uh-uh.  No, I was told  the opposite.  No?  Did he get yelled at?  Is that why  you're cranky today, Earl?  Well, I was told  the opposite.  Huh?  I was told the opposite,  that they wanted me  to go to the WOW sticker.  No, they were going  to take you off  our show for a while  because they didn't  think you could handle it.  And I said,  no, that's not fair  to Earl.  Is the man  getting down on you,  Earl? 
[00:48:00]  So we worked  things out for you today.  So can we paint  your face green?  No.  Come on, Earl.  We'll get some green paint  from Sip, Sip,  Sipperstein, Philby.  What's the problem  you have with Shrek?  No, no problem.  I just don't want  to get painted green.  I'm losing my voice.  I think it'd be funny.  Don't you think?  You're not sick today,  Earl, are you?  Earl?  Yes.  Are you sick today?  No, I think I'm losing  my voice. 
[00:48:30]  Where's it going?  I don't know.  You didn't even use it  when you were in Boston,  so why are you losing it?  I don't know.  I just woke up,  whatever.  All right.  A little under the weather,  I'm assuming.  Yes.  We're in beautiful  Secaucus, New Jersey.  Everywhere is beautiful.  I thought it was  East Rutherford.  No, I said Secaucus.  Why are they saying  East Rutherford?  I don't know.  In my coffee here.  I'm reading an email  and it says,  we're in beautiful Secaucus.  I'm assuming there's  not many people there  because no one really knows  where they're going, right?  It's 330 County Avenue, 
[00:49:00]  Secaucus, New Jersey.  How many people are there?  We have a rat full of cars.  Oh, okay.  All right, Earl.  Someone's commenting  Earl liked playing  in the softball game.  So that's one thing  he's enjoyed.  Earl, you enjoyed that, right?  You were the,  where did we put you?  Center field?  Right field.  Why did we put you  in right field?  I don't know.  That's where you put me.  Earl was like  the MVP of our,  no, no,  you weren't the MVP  of our team.  Your brother was.  You were like,  you were up there, though.  No, your brother 
[00:49:30]  had four hits.  He caught everything inside.  He had a great game.  Well, you were right there, Earl.  You're going to be  the starting center fielder  on my team this year.  How's that?  If we stay.  Good?  Earl?  Yes.  Hold on, man.  All right.  You're going in and out.  I'm sorry, guys.  Well, hold on.  Lewis wants it.  Lewis?  Yeah, man.  You've got to stop  picking on Earl.  The truth is  he's upset  because his movie  came in second  to a chick flick.  Pearl Harbor  beat out Shrek, Earl. 
[00:50:00]  He's also upset  because that annoying donkey  keeps following him around.  Is this D. Lewis?  Much like Lewis  following the show around.  Is this D. Lewis?  Earl, you have something  to say to D. Lewis?  You're a loser.  Oh.  That hurt me.  You can't find  Secaucus  and I'm the loser?  You're standing  in front of the  Empire State Building  going,  like you're going  and having a show  because you have no life  and I'm the loser?  You're not funny  and I'm the loser? 
[00:50:30]  I think it's really funny  right now.  I don't know.  I'm the loser?  All right, Earl.  With that much experience  you think he's a  Seasucker.  Earl dropped  the Seasucker bomb.  Earl?  Hey, Earl.  I guess his phone  got disconnected.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  It's all right.  God damn.  Earl?  Earl?  Yes.  I'm very proud  of you today.  You're fighting back. 
[00:51:00]  I like that.  You're showing up.  I'm sorry?  I like you today.  You're fighting back.  You're feisty today, Earl.  You got some...  I just...  I'm just in mood today.  I don't want to deal  with listeners.  You got spunk.  All right?  Yes.  We're at  Meadowlands,  Ford,  in beautiful  Seasucker,  New Jersey.  It's a  3rd County  happening.  I'll be here  until 5 o'clock.  All right.  Can you stay  maybe a little  longer than 5,  maybe?  I'm sorry? 
[00:51:30]  Can you stay  a little longer  than 5?  Yeah,  we can do  something about that.  Like 5.15,  maybe?  Earl?  Yes.  Oh, good.  All right.  And, guys,  I think we have  a potential  flower on our way.  Oh, look at that.  Ah.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Will you be  looking at the  fine boobs  or will you be  looking the other  way?  I'll be looking  at the fine boobs.  Remember,  when you get  your sticker  from Earl,  you can always  say,  I got it  from a  Negro.  Right.  All right,  Earl.  Thank you  for your support. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  All right.  We'll talk to you  in a bit.  There he goes.  Earl,  who doesn't want  to be called  Shrek.  If you wanted  Earl to be green,  wouldn't you just  have to paint  him yellow?  Holy, yeah.  It's yellow  and blue.  Oh, is it?  Right?  I thought it was  yellow and brown.  Yellow and brown  makes orange.  Oh, okay.  I think.  Yellow and brown  makes orange.  That's reasonable.  If there's blue  and you add  to the yellow,  that would be green.  That would be green. 
[00:52:30]  And I don't think  it mixes.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  It mixes, Phil.  All right.  We have to  take a break here.  All right.  We've got to get  Stinky in here  because he has  some choice words  for what the hell  the guy,  Casey Martin.  Yeah.  Casey Martin  won his trial.  We'll give you  a chance next,  Stinky.  All right?  212-757-1027.  You have 30 seconds  to whirl me.  Whip my mouth. 
[00:53:00]  Whip my mouth.  Whip my mouth.  What the hell?  1027-WNEW.  Oh, my God.  1027-WNEW is  The Sport Guys  at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Hopi and Anthony at 3.

[00:53:30]  you know,  for certain eyes only.  Like a vag tat?  Oh, I've seen that.  Well, yeah,  like slippery when wet,  you know,  like right there,  just before you enter  the back hair.  How about do not enter?  Yeah, that's the one  I used to say.  Yeah, that's fine.  The Radio Chick,  weekdays 9 to noon,  1027-WNEW.  Are we going to talk  about what the chick  just talked about?  I think maybe.  All right.  Well, it'll work out  somehow.  It's all right.  Auto Lock Pro, Anthony.  Yes, yes.

He is a police sheriff.  We missed a great line.  I just got to interrupt.  Black Sheet from New Jersey.  Earl was on the phone  and we asked him  if there was a lot  of people there.  And Earl said  there was a lot of cars.  Yeah.  This guy writes,  Earl, there's a lot  full of cars.  You're at a freaking  car dealership,  you idiot.  I didn't even think  about that.  I didn't pick up on that.  Very good.  Auto Lock Pro's

[00:55:30]  Thank you,  Brian O'Toole  from Massapequa Park.  Hour, hour, hour, hour  by Opie and Anthony  serving New Jersey,  Connecticut,  Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show,  212-757-1027  in the studio today.  Cowbell,  Bill,  and our buddy,  our pal,  Jim Norton,  stopping by to say hi. 
[00:56:00]  Not.  Did you pull your  junk out last night  at the bar?  No, no, no.  No?  No, nothing.  Cool.  I was warning everybody.  I kind of threw a warning  out there, Opie,  to everybody.  Good luck out.  Look out for Norton.  He likes pulling his junk out  and laying it on girls' legs.  Give it a nice plug,  though,  I appreciate it.  Well,  I'll plug your junk.  It's pretty funny, man.  Hey, Norton,  any thoughts on Christopher Reeve?  We were talking.  Did you see the latest  picture in the paper?  I just got it  in commercial.  I'm looking at it. 
[00:56:30]  It is sad.  It's very sad,  very tragic,  but he was on,  I don't even know,  the Today Show  or something this morning,  and he lost his eyebrows.  Yeah, I don't know.  He looks awful.  I bet he goes down  on his wife.  He probably gets his head  like that owl  eating a cookie pop  because he can't breathe  because he can't breathe  because he can't breathe too well  with three licks  and he gets frustrated  and just bites it.  One,  two,  three,  three.  Chris,  on the instant feedback,  maybe Christopher Reeves 
[00:57:00]  is going through  a Pink Floyd,  the wall face.  Oh, right,  where he shaved off  his eyebrows and stuff.  Sure.  I bet that's it.  Where's Stinky?  Yeah,  Stinky's got a problem  with Casey Martin.  Casey Martin,  of course,  was the guy  that has some kind  of weird,  I don't know,  disease that prevents  him from walking.  He's a cripple.  He's a cripple.  You use, like,  terminology  from two centuries ago.  I believe  the boy's a cripple.  He's got polio. 
[00:57:30]  Polio.  He got the Ricky.  Ricky.  Cripple.  But,  I don't know,  he has a tough time  with, what,  blood circulation  so he can't walk  for too long  and he's pretty much  sued the PGA  so he can  drive his little  golf cart  to play in the PGA.  A lot of people  say part of the game  is walking.  You know,  no one takes  golf carts  in the Professional  Golfers Association.  You know what?  It sucks to be  Casey Martin,  but you know what?  He should not be  allowed to use  a cart  to play golf.  If you can't play 
[00:58:00]  the way everyone  else plays,  why can't you play?  It's our stupid  PC society.  It's getting ridiculous.  That's why  they make  Special Olympics.  Right.  It could be  in the Special  Olympic golf.  You don't see  guys in the NBA  in wheelchairs.  Right.  Exactly.  Everybody else  is in wheelchairs.  This is going to  set a precedent.  I'm telling you,  man.  Crazy.  Like, all right,  walking's not  the biggest part  of golf,  but it is a part.  The peak sets in,  you're not standing  the same.  Right.  Right.  I can tell you  it's a big part. 
[00:58:30]  Especially at the  last two holes,  you know?  Yeah.  Walking is a huge  part of golf.  Huge.  I've only had  two jobs in my life.  A DJ and a caddy.  That's it.  That's all I've done  in my whole life.  Winning that caddy  tournament.  Now that's important.  I spent like 14 years  at the Huntington Crescent  Club.  I'm telling you,  walking is part of golf.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, Bill.  Bill's a pretty  avid golf.  Oh, yeah.  And by the end  of the 18 holes, 
[00:59:00]  you know,  your legs aren't there  if you've been walking.  And that's driving.  Yeah,  and that's driving.  Well,  that's just a beer chick  keeps coming by.  Yeah,  chasing around,  man.  I'm pooped.  Nothing more fun  than driving those cars  than after a few beers.  You really don't care.  Aim for the goose.  Do you want to go to the goose?  Now think,  are you golf?  I used to golf  in my high school days.  What happened?  Why don't you golf anymore?  I just got sick  of all the pompous people  that played.  Like,  I couldn't,  none of my friends played, 
[00:59:30]  so I couldn't really  go out and have fun.  Right.  So I always had to play  with losers that thought  golf.  Threesome.  Their way,  you know,  to fame and riches.  Career industry  to high schoolers.  Right.  Yeah.  I ended my career.  A devastating score  of 120  killed my career.  Derek,  what's up?  What's up, man?  Y'all got it all wrong.  He didn't sue them.  They took him to court.  They both took each other  to court.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not like he just  showed up on a golf course  and started riding. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah,  the PGA did not want,  you know,  someone riding a cart  in their tournament.  Right.  And I don't blame him.  But that didn't have  anything to do  with him golfing.  It's not the same thing  like basketball.  He doesn't have  an unfair advantage.  Yes, he does.  Yes, he does.  His legs.  No, no, no.  You know why?  It's not like these guys  are carrying their own  golf bags.  Derek,  how could you say  he doesn't have  an unfair advantage?  You're not going to  talk about walking, right?  But they're walking,  but they're not  carrying their own bags.  So?  They're walking. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, like that's  really something?  Wait, wait, wait.  They haven't been  carrying their bags  for many, many, many, many.  I don't even know  how long.  I would give you  the benefit of the doubt.  Caddies have been  bagged.  Caddies have been  gnapped.  So that's not  you golf.  Oh, no.  I'm Derek.  I won't go.  Derek.  So what the hell  are you talking for?  What I'm saying?  No, but I know  he's talking out  his ass.  He's a ass.  God.  Really?  Yeah.  What it does is  if you walk 18 holes, 
[01:01:00]  you're walking a lot.  Right.  And if your legs  aren't built up for it,  you're going to stand  there at the 18th tee  with your legs shaking  or something  because you don't have  to, you know,  your legs aren't in shape.  And take a cart.  Right.  And you've got to  concentrate on making a shot.  You're tired.  You're exhausted.  Right.  Your legs hurt.  And you will have  an unfair advantage  because the other guys  aren't going to be pussies  and start driving around  in carts.  You're not going to see  Tiger Woods in a golf  cart.  Right.  That would be a fun cart.  It's just not. 
[01:01:30]  Big tiger plaid  upholstery.  Drunker on the other seat.  Driving in a left lane  real slow.  Hey.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, Whitey.  What's going on, guys?  Talk to any old fart  that goes to the country club.  They're always driving  from hole to hole.  What the heck  does it matter?  It really doesn't weigh  on how far you drive the ball,  how well you put it, right?  It has no interference  with the game.  Oh, my God.  Yes, it does.  And it doesn't matter 
[01:02:00]  what the old people  are doing at the country club.  You're talking  professional sports.  Right, exactly.  It's a professional sport.  We drink beer  at softball games, too.  I don't think you see  any of the guys  in the Major League Baseball  popping beers  at the bases.  But also,  it's not like the guy's  being lazy.  I mean,  he's like semi-handicapped.  You just can't walk  from hole to hole.  Then why don't you play  in the handicap league?  Right.  There's a handicap league?  I'm sure there is.  Oh, wow.  I want to get tickets for that.  We'll start one.  I want to go get a ball.  I'll get you next year.  Cold Bergen Point.  Carts have no business 
[01:02:30]  being in golf.  I don't know  if I agree with that.  On the pro tour.  I mean, if the guy's  doing all right,  I mean,  as soon as they get  to every hole,  they get to sit down  and take a drink  or whatever else.  Isn't that the same thing?  Huh?  Every time they get  to a new hole,  they sit down.  They have chairs  set up for the guys.  They would sit down.  They'd do a towel thing.  They'd drink  or whatever.  And then they'd get up  and then they'd go play.  Isn't that like  the same thing  as sitting from hole to hole?  Yeah, but imagine  if it's 100 degrees out  and Casey Martin  gets to drive his cart  with the breeze blowing on him. 
[01:03:00]  Nice, right.  Nice, nice, nice.  These guys have to check  500 yards a hole  uphill, uphill, yeah.  Okay, then you know what?  Someone else  washing his balls for him.  You know,  the guy probably doesn't  wash his own balls.  Right.  He's hitting his shaft  on his cart.  Well, then maybe  we should let everybody  use the cart.  Polishing his shaft  and washing his ball.  No, Brian,  what's going to have to happen  now?  The P.J.  is going to have  to turn around  and say,  whoever wants to use a cart  can use a cart.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what's going to happen.  And it's all fair again, right?  Yeah, we're a nation 
[01:03:30]  that we're turning  into a bunch of pussies.  Yeah, but it's updating.  Everything updates,  like football, baseball,  you know,  all the uniforms  and all that other stuff.  This is their way  of updating golf,  you know?  No, it's our way  of saying, you know,  everyone should be treated fair  and screw all that.  Right, you're allowed  one handicap, not two.  In football,  you didn't see  Darryl Stingley  being transported  up and down  in a wheelchair  after he had his accident.  You're crippled.  Now sit in a room  so we don't have  to look at you.  That's what this guy  should do.  Take his little  acrophy-ridden leg 
[01:04:00]  and just sit somewhere.  His feet look like butter.  Little turnip root feet  just pointing  at every which of the way.  It's got like  that one baby leg.  Angling off the chair.  The breeze comes,  they just blow to the left  and blow to the right.  Hey, pussy willow feet,  stay home.  Oh.  I think you had  a little problem with that.  I'm home with me.  I agree. 
[01:04:30]  Like, what if in NASCAR,  if someone couldn't drive  so they sat  in the air-conditioned room  and did the car  with remote control  or something?  It'd be the same thing.  That would be cool.  Like, Sabbath  is all in every sport.  That could be  the worst analogy  I've ever heard.  I'm thinking.  Why not?  I'm thinking  the phone's ringing.  Oh, man.  God damn.  Was that necessary?  You're degrading the guy.  Not at all.  You know if I'm kidding.  You want a golf course 
[01:05:00]  to go back and forth  to the phone?  Let's use this chair.  Yeah.  You need the potty funnel.  He's suing the PGA  for the right  to smoke dope  at every hall.  Ed, what's going on?  He hasn't played the field.  You're sitting here  talking about him  driving the cart.  How many tournaments  has the guy won  because of the effing cart?  How many tournaments?  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  Now they're screwing  with the game.  Now everybody's  going to be  driving on their cart.  They're making some changes  because of handicaps  and that's everybody.  That's even McDonald's  now has a handicap ramp. 
[01:05:30]  It's not a sport.  The sports can't do.  It's true.  It's not a sport  but the guy hasn't won  squats as he can.  McDonald's is actually  a sport by the way.  It's part of the game.  It's part of the game.  You can see how far  you can go  without taking a dump.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  You know, you play basketball.  It's not like, you know,  okay, you're allowed  to walk to the other  end of the court.  We'll wait for you.  We'll meet you there.  I like the radio  control cars.  I like the stinking.  I know it's a lousy analogy  but just the image  in my head  of a room full of guys 
[01:06:00]  in front of steering wheels  and cars just burst  into flames  with impunity.  I love it.  With the helmets?  I'm there.  Yeah, but like...  Yeah, stinking.  Would the people  in the room  be wearing the helmet?  Just in case, yeah.  If your car crashes,  you have to go outside  and they shoot you.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Listen,  you know what they should  do to this guy?  They should make him  go in a wheelchair  and wheel himself 
[01:06:30]  around the court  so then by, you know,  by the fourth toll,  he'll be so tired,  he'll quit.  That's hand trying  to be rough.  You know how hard it is  to do a wheelchair  on grass?  All right.  Very good, Joe.  Why don't they give him  a few strokes  before we even start?  A few less strokes.  Give him a little handicap  because it's not fair.  He's got one already.  Well, maybe his caddy  should just grab him  by the mule  and drag him  from hall to hall.  That's a compromise  we can all live with.  The other three players  in your force 
[01:07:00]  can get to whack you  in your nuts  with your three-iron.  Whatever happens  to Survival of the Fittest?  Yeah.  At least we can have  Survival of the Fittest  in professional sports.  We've given up  on that theory  in everyday life  for some reason.  Yeah.  In sports,  if your legs don't work,  take up reading.  I mean,  you don't have to  contribute to sports  anymore.  You can always read  golf side yet.  Actually,  get a black guy  over your house,  just order him around. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Steve is a golf instructor.  Everyone has disagreed  with us on this topic.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Steve, what's going on?  Fellas, what's going on?  Hey.  I used to be an instructor  and you've got to look at it  from this aspect,  that we're now  in the 21st century.  All these guys  are working out  and lifting weights  and doing all this kind of stuff  and this guy can't do that.  What is your handicap  aside mentally?  So,  and that's our problem  so we should make it easier  for him to compete?  He's an anomaly. 
[01:08:00]  He's a one,  he's a freak.  He's the only guy  who's this good  with that kind of a disadvantage.  That's good.  No, I don't want to see  sports teams over the years.  Look what happened  with the three-point line  in basketball.  I don't want to see,  I don't want to see  golf carts all over the course.  You're going to see one cart.  No, you're not.  You're going to see other guys.  You know what?  I got a back injury  and you know what?  I'm going to ride today.  It's going to change  the whole sport.  I got a disagree  on that one, boys.  I think this guy's a freak  and I think you got  to let him go.  Lower the baskets  in basketball  because I'm too short. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Why not lower the baskets?  Why don't we put  the baseball on a tee?  John Daly's a freak.  T-ball?  You want to play  T-ball?  Because I can't  hit very well.  No, but not for everyone.  Maybe there's a guy  who has some kind  of weird handicap,  can't see the ball  coming at that speed,  so why don't we  just put it on a tee  for him?  Yeah.  Why not?  To be honest with you,  though,  to see a guy  with a disability  playing golf,  just the humor value  of that,  like he might get hurt,  it might almost be  worth watching.  Maybe his little weak legs  will give out  and he'll fall.  Just snap. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Just go down  like William Holden  hitting the coffee table.  That might be nice.  God damn,  that's horrible.  And T.C. Morinori  has, you know,  an advantage, you know.  He's got the best  parking spot.  All the other guys  have to walk their clubs  from, you know,  the other parking spaces.  Stinky,  would they have to  clean the windshield  in this remote-controlled  NASCAR thing, 
[01:09:30]  or would the camera  that they're watching  be somewhere  that wouldn't get dirty?  Ah,  that's a good question.  But they have  a little remote-controlled  button that changes  the lens.  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  Well, they have  that rip-off windshield thing.  You know I'm going  to wake up at 3 in the morning  tonight and think this out.  I don't know why.  Maybe if your windshield's dirty,  we could have a mid-60s  pedophile run out  in his underwear  and clean it.  Good idea.  Hey, I know one, too.  Oh, God.  Kevin, what's going on? 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, listen,  I don't know if you guys  heard about that thing  up in Scarsdale  with the Little League,  now where the parents  can't say disparaging things  against the umpire.  They can't boo  the kids on the other teams.  The kids from the other teams  can't even say anything  negative about their adversaries  on the field.  Otherwise, they'd get thrown off.  You can't say things like,  we want a pitcher,  not a kid that gets nailed  by his uncle  in the dumper every night. 
[01:10:30]  Exactly.  I mean, come on.  That would shit.  Come on.  That's funny.  Good.  Let's just raise kids  to be average.  Do you hear the games  they play now, too?  A lot of the,  not Little League,  but school-run baseball games,  they don't keep score open  because there's no winners  or losers here.  You're just playing the game.  So the kids won't be disappointed  if their team loses.  Oh, good.  Which really teaches them  competition  and what the real world  is all about.  Yeah, the winning.  The real world will accept you  for being average,  of course. 
[01:11:00]  How about just teaching  these little bratty pigs  how to handle losing?  How about being good parents  and showing them  that losing is okay?  I'm glad they're  showing each other  in high schools.  Nothing makes me happier.  I hate your kids.  I hate your kids.  Wow!  Morton!  Tuck it!  God damn,  that's going to be  a long dump sheet.  Oh, wow!  Nice!  Nice!  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:11:30]  My dad was always loaded,  couldn't understand  a thing he said.  Yeah, that's from Patch.  A lot of the dads  at the Little League games  were all tanked  and just yelling.  They get into fights  and stuff.  Now, I heard one team  or one Little League district  or whatever it is  has the parents  have to attend  sensitivity training  before they could  even go down  to the field.  Jesus.  Wasn't it fun  when a dad  would just go,  get out of here, Rob!  You know,  why don't you  put my kid in?  Put that little  wormy piece of crap 
[01:12:00]  out there.  You know,  it was always fun  to watch.  What happened  to like Ben  who's Bears  where the coach  yelled at  the courtship  of Eddie's  father kid  smacked him  in the face  because he wasn't  doing well.  That was his son.  Right.  And that was,  what's his name  from Combat,  the old Combat show.  Lost his head  in the helicopter.  Oh, that was  Vic Morrow.  Vic Morrow  and the kid  from Courtship  of Eddie's  father.  And then when  the team wins,  the coach  pops beer  for everybody.  Nice.  Happened there 
[01:12:30]  and they curse.  Ah, those are the days.  Can't make a movie  like that anymore.  And you have a lesbian  on the team pitching.  Right.  And a kid  that rides a motorcycle  around and plays  air hockey with her.  Fells weed.  Fells weed.  God forbid  we make a movie  today where kids  are sipping on beer.  Oh my God.  Oh no.  Can you imagine  the outrage?  Get about it.  I thought that  was hilarious.  Walter Matthau  handing out the beers.  God,  it doesn't get  any better than that.  Think is there  copies of  A Band of Bears  at your apartment? 
[01:13:00]  I would think  that would be  a pretty popular movie.  You keep hearing,  hey Yankees,  wait till next year.  I love that  Tanner Boyle,  stinky.  So young  yet mature.  What a dirty mouth  on him.  Sandy hair  in a swimmer's building.  Oh, Christ.  All right, listen.  We got to take a break.  Is this true?  Kelly Ripa  is on the line? 
[01:13:30]  Yep.  Nice.  I like Lupus.  He was just made  to be a victim.  What's wrong  with just playing  Little League  when you're a kid,  man?  You know,  you win,  you win,  your dad takes shots.  That's when I was raised.  God,  does that boogery  and spasm  make me want to puke?  Those men  wanted to have  sex with me.  That's nice.  My God.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah, 
[01:14:00]  Kelly Ripa's on hold.  She just heard  like the 10 minutes.  We'll see if she still  wants to come on our show.  Nope.  Jay Moore,  I guess hosting.  Jay Moore's outside  the studio.  He's coming in.  Yeah,  he's guest hosting  with Kelly Ripa.  Jay Moore  taking over  for Regis Filden  on live.  All right,  we'll talk to her next  and we'll get  Jay Moore in here  as well.  Ripa,  mom,  when is it?  What is it?  Like some kind of guy  thing?  Like some kind of  sexist guy thing?  Yeah!  You will not 
[01:14:30]  get away with this!  I wish you could  just shut your bitch  up!  It's whip-em-out Wednesday!  Ooh la la!  Obi and Anthony  N-E-W.  Uh,  Jay Moore  in the studio.  Hold on,  we're in the middle  of commercials.  Kelly Ripa  on hold  from Regis and Kelly.  I had to dump  that on myself.  Oh,  Jay,  he looks like  an effing  Vietnam  phantom pilot.  He's got the hat  on and the aviator.  Hey,  if that makes me  a more American, 
[01:15:00]  buddy,  so be it.  There you go.  You know I'm a patriot.  God bless America.  I'm not digging  the Raiders hat,  though,  man.  What are you doing?  It's black.  It matches everything.  It's black.  Did you join the  Crips or something  since we last saw you?  Great.  The Bloods?  I don't even know  who's wearing what  out there anymore.  Probably so old school  to even wear Raiders  stuff anymore.  That was 80s.  I'm rolling 60s,  niggas.  Kelly's listening  to all this.  Good.  I love Kelly.

What's up, everybody?  What's happening?  He's filling in for  Regis tomorrow.  I'm Regis and Kelly.  I'm filling in for  Regis and Kelly.  Oh, wait, do you want 
[01:18:00]  to hear that?  Hold on.  I want to thank Jay  Moore, and you can  listen to him on the  Opie and Anthony show  on the 27 in the New  York metro area.  Open.  Well, Kelly Ripper's  on the line here.  Kelly Ripper!  Kelly?  Hello?  Wow.  Foxy Mama.  Kelly, you're a brave  lady.  I heard.  I heard you guys  harsh me on your  show.  Never.  So uncool.  Never.  Never kick a pregnant 
[01:18:30]  lady when she's down.  What about when she's  up?  Did you hear what  Jay Moore wants to  do to you?  I heard.  I love Jay Moore.  He can do whatever  he wants to me.  Wow.  Can I tell you  something?  You guys have some  chemistry.  We do.  The last time Jay  filled in for Regis,  that was a fine show.  You have no idea.  You have no idea the  fan demand went crazy.  Kelly, were you  getting a little  annoyed with Jay,  though?  Never.  It seemed like she  was getting a little  short with you.  Never.  Like you would say 
[01:19:00]  some stuff.  She was like,  we're going to stay  the course here with  the interview.  No, I think she was  just shocked that  someone was actually  listening to her.  It's true.  No.  I'm not used to  being listened to.  Wow.  I loved working with  Jay.  It was like I didn't  have to work.  I had no job to do.  Hey, we love Regis,  but man, where's  his head at these days?  Regis is awesome.  Regis is the best.  He doesn't listen,  though.  No, come on.  Yeah, he does.  He's just so  crazy, you know?  I don't think  you're going to ruin  my gig.  Oh, be quiet.  All right, I'll be  quiet. 
[01:19:30]  Kelly.  You guys know what  it's like when you're  in constant demand.  The poor man is in  constant demand.  Everybody wants him  everywhere.  He needs a vacation.  He needs a vacation.  What he's doing right  now.  Hey, Kelly.  Yeah.  The flowers you sent  me, by the way, are  literally the most  beautiful flowers I've  ever seen in my entire  life.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye.  What did you do?  Did some in wax to keep  them?  Are they still alive?  No, they died, you  know.  I know.  I'm going to send you  some more, though.  Yeah.  Well, you should just  come to my house. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  I have a doorman  building.  You should come bring  them.  Maybe I will.  Yeah.  I'll get the place  cleaned up.  I have a, you know,  you guys, the show  gives me a hotel room,  so I'll give the hotel  room to my roommate.  Spider inviting me  fly into the web.  And we could play  like PlayStation and  watch old movies.  I got, you know, I  got like Silkwood and  stuff on tape.  Really?  I love Silkwood.  Can we reenact the  shower scene?  Yeah.  That's my favorite  part.  Only if I can be the  sponge.  Well, I didn't know. 
[01:20:30]  The actual one from  Cycle.  That would be a nice  shower scene to do.  Hey, Kelly.  Yes?  Now, you obviously  with Regis and stuff,  but what does he say  about that, um, that  Kathy Lee that was  there before you?  Oh, he loves her.  I'm detecting, I'm  sensing things that  maybe he wasn't too  happy with her toward  the end.  That's not true.  Really?  That is not true.  Like he finally won  that daytime Emmy and  it's because she wasn't  the aunt?  No.  And he's tired of it.  He was getting tired of  the Cody Cassidy thing. 
[01:21:00]  And you're not, you're  not thinking of doing  anything like that, are  you?  No, I think that he  loves to bust her chops  and he'll bust my chops.  He'll bust anybody's chops.  But he like, he loves  her.  I don't think, I don't  think there's a person  on this earth that he  doesn't like.  Yeah, he seems like he  loves everybody.  He really does.  He really, really does.  I heard he wanted his  money back on a rich  boss show instead of  him.  This guy's not funny.  I don't get the jokes.  Gentlemen, explain it  to me.  Kelly, I am so excited 
[01:21:30]  to be with you tomorrow.  I am too.  I can't wait.  I love when, when you  come in, I feel like I  don't have any work  ahead of me.  Remember, I was  flossing my teeth and  you were like, no, we're  on the air right now.  I couldn't believe it.  You guys, you don't  understand.  They're like, they're  chewing me.  They're like, come on,  come on, come on,  let's go.  And Jake decides to  floss his teeth.  Right.  You've got to go out  there with the pearly  whites for the housewives  in middle America, man.  You can't go out there  with them.  You floss your teeth a  minute before the show.  Do you have to do it  as we're on the air?  I'm too cool, baby. 
[01:22:00]  I know.  Nothing rattles you.  How is that now?  You're out all the time  and people know who you  are.  I know you were in the  soaps before this, but  now this is just like  major exposure.  And you've been on  there for a while now,  so people just come up  to you all the time  and annoy the crap out  of you.  Well, luckily, I mean,  luckily, rarely do the  people that, like, you  know, that you make  sick come up to you.  Like, if I make somebody  sick, they're generally  nice enough to, like,  not approach me at all.  I'll kick their ass.  I will kick their ass. 
[01:22:30]  Thank you, Jay.  When's the baby do?  I would totally fight  you, Kelly.  Two weeks.  Two more weeks.  Yeah, I'm really big,  though.  I don't know if I'm  going to make it.  You guys got to have  the kid tomorrow morning.  I was two months  premature, and I'm fine,  but, like, your kid  two weeks premature,  that's nothing.  So you got to somehow  break your water tomorrow.  Well, uh...  Break my water?  Somehow.  Kelly...  This is shit funny.  Kelly, Ant and I  could help you with that.  We had a girl come in  here that was  nine months pregnant,  and we made her  do, like, jumping jacks.  We made her walk  up and down the... 
[01:23:00]  I swear to God,  our whole thing was  we wanted to have  a live birth on our show,  and this girl agreed  to try to have it happen,  and she came in,  nine months pregnant,  got completely naked.  We had her do  a jumping jacks,  yeah, up and down  the stairs,  like, over and over again.  Then we heard, like,  having sex could break...  That's what they say.  So her husband  went into another studio  that we like to call  the Jay Moore Suite...  No, stop it.  ...and banged her.  No.  Swear to God.  No.  And unfortunately,  after all that,  you know, 
[01:23:30]  she left here  still pregnant,  but we gave it  the old college try.  They say also lobster.  Yeah, lobster.  It's got something in it.  It's got something in it.  You need to push a lobster.  It's got something in it.  That's going to hurt.  I think that a pregnant woman  just made that episode  to get a free lobster.  She used the claws  like a clamp  and just pull it out.  Hey, Kelly,  can I tell you something, Kelly?  What's that?  You know,  I can't wait for tomorrow  because you're so pretty.  Nuh-uh.  There you are.  I was once, so...  I have those fond memories 
[01:24:00]  of being pretty.  Kelly,  I know you were always pretty.  I knew you before you were born.  Kelly,  let me tell you something.  You're still very hot.  Thank you.  And I'm dead.  Ask Anthony.  I love pregnant girls.  You do?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got some kind  of a sick...  Kelly, you sound like  you're getting a little excited.  You all right?  You, me?  Yeah, I'm okay.  No, Kelly behind you.  Oh, what?  What?  Hey, Kelly,  who's standing in for you  when you're having your baby?  College girls, right?  They're having a...  Yeah, a week of college.  College co-eds?  Why can't they see? 
[01:24:30]  With Regis?  They're going to turn Regis  loose on the college girls.  Wonderful.  And then they have...  It's Regis Philbin's  Teen Week.  Yeah, a week of...  Yeah, right.  And then a week  of high school girls.  Yeah.  A week of grammar school girls.  I like the junior high girls.  They're simple.  High girls.  I think anybody in college  does not even have  to be somebody in...  Jay, you picked  the wrong week.  I know, yeah.  Yeah, I know, Jay.  Really, you could have  had a college girl  and said he got me.  No, I'd rather have 
[01:25:00]  the mommy.  You never know,  they're going to  cap up college girl week  with me banging  the girl from Notre Dame.  No, stop it.  Kelly, how come  I don't get  to co-host with Regis?  You know what?  You may have to.  Let me tell you something.  If I go, you know,  if I go into labor early,  you may have to  pin shit for me, Jay.  You may have to  swing both ways.  Somehow,  I think that's a problem  for you.  Hey, I don't do that.  That's not what  she means anyway. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, that's not  what I was talking about.  Is your husband  on to us?  Because my wife's  totally on to us.  Is she?  What does she suspect?  Well, you know,  she just knows  that there's  that special chemistry.  Jay, watch the soft spot  on that baby's head.  My favorite show  was the day you co-hosted,  the day we co-hosted together.  It was so much fun.  Yeah, he thought  it was awesome.  She's fine with it.  You know when you get married,  everyone's allowed  like they're one person.  Exactly.  So my wife,  I go, you know,  what if I just go down  swinging with a Kelly Ripa?  She goes,  well, you know,  I couldn't fight you  on that one. 
[01:26:00]  Why not?  She's put like a beach ball.  What do I have to see her?  The green bang  can't be attainable, Jay.  It's not someone  you work with.  I'm starting to think  that Jay has already  kissed Kelly Ripa's kid.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  What?  Opie.  Opie would lead people  to believe that Jay  has kissed your child already.  Oh, no, not yet.  But Wolf,  I'll let you know  after tomorrow.  There's always tomorrow.  Who are the guests, Kelly?  What's that? 
[01:26:30]  Who do you got  on tomorrow's show?  Oh, tomorrow we have  Y-Class.  Yes.  We have,  oh, God,  there goes my brain.  He's black.  He's black, you know, Kelly.  I know that.  I don't know.  Hey, you've got to tell  Gellman to leave you alone.  You're doing fine.  Gellman's great.  Why?  Does he bother me?  He is so uptight.  He might be a good producer  behind the scenes,  but he is so uptight.  Gellman, you keep her in line  while I'm awake.  I don't want to destroy  him the show  with that Jay Moore.  No, he's a good man.  Listen, if it wasn't for Jay, 
[01:27:00]  who do you think  books you?  It's Gellman.  Really?  Yeah, man.  It's Gellman.  Gellman and Sid.  He talks about Jay  all the time.  Kelly, I don't think  he likes him.  He just seems uptight  on the show.  I'm sure he's a good guy  and he's a good producer  behind the scenes.  He's really cool.  He is, yeah,  he is round tight.  I would say  he's high-strung by nature,  but he certainly  runs a smooth ship  over there.  He's so not high-strung.  You don't even understand.  But does he know  how to have fun?  Yeah.  It seems like  he doesn't ever have fun.  Oh, my God,  he has so much fun.  I think he's portrayed 
[01:27:30]  and I think he is  the most different person  than his...  First of all,  he's a good producer.  What?  What?  What did you say?  Do you understand him say?  No.  No, his whole personality  doesn't come across  on the show at all.  Oh.  You know,  like, he's really fun  and he's not a tight.  He's really laid back.  Who else is on the show?  Huh?  Who's on Friday's show?  Friday's show,  I don't know,  we have a...  What, you're doing  Thursday and Friday, Jay?  Yeah, we're doing  Thursday and Friday.  Wow, look at you. 
[01:28:00]  Is Gelman a gay man?  No, Gelman is not.  Yeah, because I remember  with those Richard Simmons  who used to come on the show  and he would get in the shorts  with Richard Simmons.  I don't do anything  for ratings.  His wife,  have you seen Gelman's wife?  Yeah, he's married  and he had the kid  on the way too, right?  He has a baby.  Oh, okay, that's right.  Oh, don't go.  His wife is gorgeous.  It's called a beard.  His wife is gorgeous.  Yeah.  You wouldn't think  he was gay  if you saw his wife.  Is Wyclef doing  all six segments  for two days?  No.  It's called promotion.  There's four million 
[01:28:30]  people listening.  We have Billy Gilman  on Friday.  Who else do we have?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, yeah, Mrs. Green Tom.  Oh, my God.  Mrs. Green Tom.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  All right, Gary Gilman.  Oh, Colleen Haskell  from The Animal.  All right, hold on.  Who's listening in  to our conversation?  No, just Debbie  who's here to remind me  who the guests are.  Debbie, do you like us  or are you annoyed  that we have Kelly  on our show?  No, she likes us.  Okay, good.  She likes, I mean,  you know, she's always  annoyed when she has  to deal with me,  but you she likes.  All right. 
[01:29:00]  Kelly, you're not  annoying at all.  No, we like Kelly a lot.  Really?  These guys do always.  No, I'm watching  the show again.  I couldn't stand  Kathy Lee.  Why?  I just couldn't stand her.  You're not parading  those kids out there,  are you?  No, I mean,  this is Mario  and this is Hector.  That destroyed that show.  Do you guys have kids?  No.  Are you going to have  kids someday?  What's your first kid?  Yeah, but I'm not going  to like parade them  around on the radio  over and over again.  We prefer dating them  at this phase of our life. 
[01:29:30]  No, I'm just saying  that you have to,  I mean, but you'll see  like when you have kids,  you have to talk about them.  Kelly, yeah,  but you had to get  nauseous with Kathy Lee  doing that all the time,  though.  Well, I mean,  I don't know  that she did it all the time.  I physically vomited  the day she started  doing the egg song  where she's singing  about how Cody  and Giff  sat there eating an egg  and she writes  a goddamn song about it.  Wrote a song about it  like to sing it  before your head goes.  That made you vomit?  I swear, I physically...  It made you vomit?  You have issues.  I physically got sick 
[01:30:00]  from, I just couldn't take it.  It had nothing to do  with his hangover at all.  No, no.  Exactly.  Might have been  the Jager-Montage.  Might have been  the Keri Nyquil.  Are you a drinking gal  when you're not pregnant?  Yeah.  I mean, I like to go out  once in a while  and have a few.  What's your poison?  She looks like a party girl.  She's a Jager.  I like margaritas.  My husband's Mexican,  so I'm a margarita drinker.  Nice.  What background are you, Kelly?  My father's Italian.  My mother's Irish and Italian.  I see the Irish in you. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Most people see the Irish in me.  That's a good look  with an Italian  mixed with Irish.  It tames down  the whole Italian thing.  I bet you're not hairy, right?  I'm not hairy at all.  That's good.  Easy.  I'm actually...  No, I'm really not.  I'm pretty hairless.  No, I think that's good.  That's good.  Yeah, she's pretty hairless.  And the Italian side  of the family  must have loved  the Mexican husband  coming in.  Yes.  Yes, they did.  Cool.  And, Kelly,  you should say hi  to Jim Norton,  the sick F.  Hi, Kelly.  Hey, Jim.  Congratulations on the show.  Hey, Kelly, 
[01:31:00]  I'm in Rascals  all weekend  if you want to come down.  Are you?  Yeah, here we go.  Stop,  because that's a nice invitation  for the gals.  Of course, yeah.  Hey, no, wait.  Listen, Alyssa and Jan  saw your show  and they said  you were awesome.  Jay Moore's hysterical.  They said you were  like the best.  No, he puts on a great show.  He really does.  I can't wait.  All right, Kelly.  I'm, uh...  You live in Jersey still?  No, you live in Manhattan.  I got a place in the city now  so I can come.  What?  Sounds good.  What?  Everybody moans  like that was a bad thing. 
[01:31:30]  Well, we're all just behaving.  Yeah, because you should  always follow up  that word with something else.  Oh, so you can come  so I can come around.  Right.  Right.  We're in such a state  of arrested development.  It's ridiculous here.  And trust me...  It is.  It's a bit like  junior high over there.  Kelly, we're on  our good behavior today.  We're all biting our lips.  Oh, that's good.  I appreciate it.  I have respect  because I know you're my girl.  Listen, I'm telling you,  I'm just telling you  that, you know,  you have to have me  on the show  when I'm no longer pregnant. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  I feel like I've got to  watch my mouth  when I'm pregnant.  Can you come by  and we'll do margaritas and stuff?  Absolutely.  Nice.  I would love that.  We're going to hold you to it.  Listen, you don't need  to hold me to it.  What if you don't have  the job anymore?  Oh, she's going to stay there.  That's okay.  What if one of those  college girls move right in?  You know what?  You're not the first person  that said that to me.  I like you.  Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah.  Jeff Probst was on today  and he's like,  you know,  those college girls  are going to replace you.  You know,  you haven't had this job that long. 
[01:32:30]  I was like,  thanks, Jeff Probst.  I'm filling in for the day.  I'm writing jokes  that the host of Survivor  thought of.  What's that?  I'm writing jokes  that the host of Survivor  already thought of.  Exactly.  No.  Kelly, I'm not going  to be in today.  I'm going to a mixer  with a girl from Penn State.  That's okay.  As long as Jay can come.  That's right.  On the show.  On the show.  When is Jay can come  to the show?  I'd say we hire people  to like detain Regis.  You could do that.  That'd be like  the king of comedy.  We'll have like  Sandra Bernhardt and De Niro.  We'll be gagged and bound. 
[01:33:00]  Jerry, you.  You, Jerry.  Yo.  Yo.  I'm sure Regis  will be grateful  for the break.  Rippa,  where in Jersey  are you from?  Originally?  No.  January 5th,  19th.  No.  I live in a different  area now,  but originally  I'm from South Jersey  near Philly.  Where?  Berlin.  What high school  did you go to?  Eastern.  Was that a huge  regional school?  Yes.  Huge regional school.  Were they like  the greatest sports 
[01:33:30]  programs ever  because they got  five different  high schools  mixed into one set?  Um, you know,  we had a good  wrestling team  and a good  basketball team  and other than that  I don't think  we really stood  out much at all.  Were you a cheerleader?  Yeah, sure was.  Did you ever do  your cheerleader?  See, I can't ask you  these things in the morning.  No, you can.  No, I can.  You can?  Why?  What are you going to ask?  Did you ever wear  your cheerleading outfit  without the, like,  little shorts part?  No, you could get  suspended for that.  No, I'm talking about  just like around the house.  Wait a minute,  there was a girl  in my high school  that did that. 
[01:34:00]  No, I mean,  that's a prerequisite  for the college girls  coming in.  No panty.  I hear Regis  has quite the potty mouth.  Is that true?  True, me?  No, Regis,  like when he's  just hanging out,  not on TV.  Regis has a potty mouth?  Yeah.  In front of me.  No?  No, he's a gentleman.  Quite the peppery language.  He's a gentleman.  I have a potty mouth  and he's constantly  correcting me.  You do?  What's your favorite  curse word?  Just say the first letter.  Oh, boy.  I have a lot of them.  I mean,  it's too many  to narrow it down  to just one. 
[01:34:30]  I say,  I say S a lot.  You say the S word?  Yeah, a lot.  She's half Italian,  so she likes to mix  like 11 in a row together.  It's true.  I like the I am five.  I am five.  I am five.  I am five.  I am five.  I am five.  I am five.  Hey,  we got the cycle laugh  guy on the phone.  Hey, Kelly,  do you have a good laugh?  Who, me?  Yeah.  Do I have a good laugh?  Yeah,  can you laugh on cue?  Yeah, I guess.  All right,  hold on a second.  Hey, Kelly,  you know what?  This is so wrong,  but we have to try this.  Hold on.  Walter. 
[01:35:00]  Hey, guys.  Walter gets off  when girls laugh at him.  Oh, you're kidding.  Yeah,  he likes being laughed at.  No, actually,  I'm not kidding.  Yeah,  by the way,  Kelly,  he's a mental patient.  I get that.  And girls laugh at him  and he gets excited.  Do you want me  to laugh at you?  Yeah.  Okay,  you ready?  You're a good actress,  sure.  Kelly,  you're the best.  Yeah.  What kind of laugh  do you like,  though?  I mean,  like,  I've got to know,  do you want,  like, 
[01:35:30]  a psychotic laugh?  I don't think  he got along  with his mother laugh.  No,  he's telling me  it's a degrading laugh,  like you're laughing at him.  Okay,  you ready?  Yeah,  he's very picky  with his laugh,  so.  Okay,  you ready?  Walter,  are you ready?  Yep.  Okay.  How's that?  Wow.  That was good.  That's like Walter  took down his jeans 
[01:36:00]  and you saw an acorn.  As you did that,  he murdered a hooker  with a spade shovel.  Oh,  Jesus,  Jim.  Those things  just things like that.  that's horrible.  Walter.  Yeah.  Was that good for you?  Oh,  yes,  it was.  Walter,  anything I can do  to help?  Don't say that.  Get on now.  All right.  That did sound  a lot like  Jay's wife's laugh.  That's my wife.  Was that your wife's laugh?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  That was a good laugh.  This guy's getting off  on your wife's laugh,  Jay.  Let's do Kelly  and then my wife  and then we'll go back  and we'll go back  to the Battle Royale  and this guy  will shoot all over  his jail cell.  You should mix him  up a tape.  Yeah.  There's people laughing  at him.  Hey,  come on.  Want some girls  on the line?  No,  we just gave you  a celebrity laugh,  Walter.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah,  I know that.  Get some girls  on the line now.  You ungrateful prick.  Give him one more. 
[01:37:00]  Does jail cell  look like a scene  from Turner and Hooch?  Maybe you can have  some of the college girls  come on.  All right,  Walter,  we're going to let you go,  right?  All right.  Bye, Walter.  Hi, Walter.  Wow,  Kelly's so sexy, man.  There goes Walter.  She's talking to mental  patients,  I'm getting a lot.  Kelly,  you rocked something.  Is that man okay?  No,  he really didn't murder  or prosecute,  did he?  No,  man,  I'm pretty effing  false,  I'm okay.  That wasn't his one  phone call,  was it?  He just wasted  with me laughing at him?  They get a lot of guys  from prison that call 
[01:37:30]  the show.  I'm sure.  I don't doubt it.  You haven't gotten  prison letters yet?  Oh,  sure.  I've been getting  prison letters  for 11 years.  The soap operas.  Yeah,  the soap operas.  Which one were you?  My character's like  a little hellcat,  so I get all kinds of,  you know,  I get the most prison mail,  I think,  more than anyone else.  Kelly,  which one are you in?  All My Children.  All My Children.  You've been on  another 10 years,  right?  Mm-hmm.  You never did Days?  No,  I never did Days.  Kelly,  you must be  filthy rich  with two shows  gone at the same time. 
[01:38:00]  Yes,  I'm filthy rich.  I don't even know  what to do  with all my money.  You're filthy rich bitch.  No,  I think the,  I always,  I often say  the reason I was hired  at Live  is because I was  the cheapest.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  Now,  you were the best  without a doubt.  Oh,  thanks.  I was watching  that whole process.  You did fine.  Kelly,  laugh at me.  Laugh at me.  Laugh at me.  You want me to laugh  at you?  I'm sorry.  I want you  to laugh at Regis.  I will.  But somehow  when I laugh at Regis,  it doesn't really  have the same effect  on him 
[01:38:30]  as it had on Walter.  Did you let Jay  touch your pregnant belly?  Sure,  yeah,  he did.  He did?  Yeah.  Did I have a nice touch?  I think you touched  my belly button,  too,  didn't you?  Oh,  really?  Don't I have a nice touch?  You do.  Like a man,  but I knew  to touch yourself.  Like a man,  but gentle.  That's right.  But you knew  those were some  man hands on you.  Yeah.  You knew that  you had to,  celebrating himself.  You had that  velvet dress on.  You had that  red velvet dress on  with the belly button  sticking out,  and when I rubbed it,  I was very gentle,  but you knew  the right circumstances 
[01:39:00]  those were going to  turn into some  man hands,  Ripper,  and you knew it.  That's right.  I knew it.  I know you knew it.  That's why all the fish  stopped swimming,  too.  That's why we're  so hot together.  You guys got to  watch the chemistry  these two have tomorrow.  Yeah,  it's really good.  Let's open the show  by slow dancing  to Al Green,  and then we tongue kiss.  We could try that.  I don't think my husband  would dig it,  though, Jay.  That's how I want  to do it with  the college girl.  I want to kick  the show up  the same way.  It would be great  to see Jay getting  chased around the stage  by a Mexican 
[01:39:30]  with an axe.  That wouldn't be  a long case, buddy.  All right,  we should let Kelly go.  All right, Kelly.  You guys have been great.  I can't wait  to see you tomorrow.  If we did that,  you could just tell  your husband,  it's ratings.  I had to help  the guy out.  It's ratings.  We didn't go down  with the guest host,  so we had to do  something special.  I will tell him that,  then.  In that case,  I'll tell him.  I'll run it by him.  You know what,  Rippa?  What's that?  You're the hottest.  You're the hottest.  I know you are.  You're the hottest.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  I'm going to come  visit you guys  when I'm not pregnant.  I can tell you're  such a party girl.  That's a lot.  She's so hot,  you have no idea.  You're like one of those  girls,  you'll do shots  with the guys  and you'll have  the lap dances  and all that fun stuff.  Actually,  I'm kind of a lightweight  with the shots.  Are you?  Yeah, I am.  I have to say.  But you didn't deny  the lap dance thing.  No, I didn't.  Look at that.  No, I didn't deny that.  Look at that.  All right,  we've never passed  them up on time.  Okay, good.  Doesn't matter.  All right.  All right, you guys. 
[01:40:30]  Bye, sweetie pie.  I'll see you tomorrow, Jay.  You got it.  We're all going to be  watching you guys tomorrow.  Okay.  Cool.  All the listeners are watching.  Four million viewers  you just picked up  with that phone call.  Awesome.  I know it's awesome.  It's awesome.  All right, Kelly.  Thanks, Kelly.  You're going to get it.  See you guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Kelly, rip up.  Jay, more work in it.  No, there's nothing to work.  You got like,  we love each other.  I think Jake likes to keep  about 20 girls  in the in case of emergency  break glass thing.  Like you work it  like you're single  just up to the point  so that God forbid 
[01:41:00]  anything happens  between you and your wife.  You just go around  with a little hammer.  All right, baby, you.  Close the deal.  I think that's astute,  accurate, and informative.  All right, we got to  take a break.  Jay's going to be on  with Kelly tomorrow.  It's going to be a fun show  to check out, you guys.  Live.  Live with Jay and Kelly tomorrow.  Yeah.  There you go.

On 1027 W.N.E.W.  with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Full house.  Jay Moore in the house.  Yeah.  Getting ready for his  little TV gig tomorrow  with Kelly Ripa.  Foxy Kelly Ripa. 
[01:43:30]  I want to thank Kelly Ripa  for being brave enough  to be on our show.  She's killed.  How Foxy is she?  She sounded like  she was having a good time.  I'm sure the publicist  was freaking out a little bit.  Nah, I think she...  Nah, the publicist  was freaking out a little bit.  Jay, publicists are really,  you know,  they're pretty uptight.  They're uptight.  Yeah.  You want to hear my impression  of a publicist?  Sure.  Fringe, hello.  Hi.  You can't say the C word. 
[01:44:00]  Oh.  Andy, Andy has a problem  with Jay.  Andy.  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hey, um,  Kelly Ripa was very good.  Yeah.  Uh, but Jay Moore  sounded like Eddie Haskell  when she was on the phone.  Eddie Haskell?  He's kissing her ass.  She's a freaking  soap opera star  who's now a talk show host.  Right.  Wait, wait, wait.  She's getting her ass  like she's ahead of Paramount.  Andy, let me tell you something.  Kelly, you can just tell  she's a really cool girl. 
[01:44:30]  I mean, that's cool,  but Jay's like,  you're beautiful.  You're so pretty.  We were showing her  some respect.  Yeah, but you know what?  Jay's working in his impact.  Jay, I love you, man.  You've got to do that.  Andy, I...  Thank you, brother.  I love you, too,  but the whole thing is  I know I don't have to do it,  but she's so foxy  you feel like you have to do it.  Andy, I didn't see it that way.  What if she divorces that Mexican  and, you know,  my wife is in it  like a bus accident or something?  Yeah, see, that's a different story.  Next thing you know,  I'm banging a talk show host. 
[01:45:00]  It's a win-win  and it's heavy as luck.  Well, yeah, it's a three-week  that happens when you get  arrested for something.  Oh.  All right, Andy.  All right, guys.  Thank you, brother.  I know what the guy's saying,  but, you know,  this is a big gig for Jay.  You've got to be nice  and you're being very nice.  And I wasn't being insincere.  Not at all.  I think she's the hottest.  She deserved it.  She sent me a nice gift.  She sent me, like,  this whole arrangement  of flowers and stuff  that weighs, like, 40 pounds.  Yeah.  I like flowers, Tony.  I like that, Tony.  I'm going to sing a song.  I'm going to blow the whole season  by singing...  Oh, man.  I'm going to... 
[01:45:30]  The last ten minutes  of the Sopranos  are going to be me singing, Tony.  Singing like a faggot.  I demand it.  How bad did that blow?  Yeah, where's the Russian guy?  Still in a tree?  Yeah.  We talked about all this.  All these stories.  No, it's okay, but...  And then introduce me  to Perugia Balk.  I'm supposed to bite on that  hooah for the entire summer?  She was a hooah.  I wonder what happened.  I wonder what Ferugia Balk's  going to get for us.  Did you get those shoes?  Yeah, Anthony Soprano,  the mob boss  who I'm deeply connected with  and I'm shopping  on Christopher's money 
[01:46:00]  who works directly under him  after he murders people.  Hey, you want to get lunch?  Sure.  She was a hooah.  First of all,  she was a hooah.  She was a hooah.  Oh, yeah, she tripped.  It's my fault she's a klutz.  My story.  It's my story.  I like when he leaves  the kid eating his cereal  and he scratches his ass  on the way out of the room.  He's a great character.  He's so over the top  and so like,  what is this, a sketch?  But for that character,  it's perfect.  He's the best. 
[01:46:30]  That's great.  I just wish Burt Young  was more than that one episode.  No doubt.  That was the highlight  of the whole season.  And Meadow's gay black boyfriend.  Meadow.  Oh, yeah.  No one even notices  I'm black on this show  because I'm so queer.  What about the neurotic roommate?  Who wants to watch somebody  that's annoying?  You know,  if you see annoying people  in real life,  the last thing you want to see  is annoying people on TV.  You're a good soul.  Charcoal briquette.  A moulinion.  Black.  That's what he said at the end. 
[01:47:00]  That's the one they took out  for editing and timing purposes.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was just wondering  if Kelly Ripper had to hang up  early with you guys  because she had to go  call the Jim Rome show.  This guy's on fire.  Let's plug only one show tomorrow, Jay.  What'd you say?  Let's plug only one show tomorrow.  Look at our listeners.  Very loyal.  Which one?  Which one?  I don't know.  It's never good enough  for our listeners.  Absolutely not.  You guys rule.  I was looking at it like,  wow, Jay just plugged our show  on national TV. 
[01:47:30]  Cool.  And this guy's looking like,  yeah, he plugged,  but he also plugged Jim Rome.  Yeah, Romy's a good guy.  He's got to have  the West Coast connection, too.  No, Romy's a good guy, man.  He just had a baby.  Anything.  Hey, that guy's cool.  All right.  And he's just not New York.  Who don't you like, Jay?  Who don't I like?  Give me a name.  I really don't know.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Jay, if you plug the show tomorrow,  don't call them local DJs.  Look at these guys.  They can be syndicated on Monday.  Hey, come on.  I never called them local DJs.  Yeah, you called them  two local guys from New York. 
[01:48:00]  I did, I did, I did.  I said, the two local guys.  All right, Jay, fix that up, man.  Let's go.  You know what?  See you later.  Mike, you're going to ruin it.  He's our only connection  to get national plug.  Nothing's going to ruin your plug tomorrow.  All right, let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, you two guys  are the ones who are kissing ass.  You're the guys  who did that hangar bit  about Kelly Rip for how long ago.  She brought it up.  She said, you know,  that you made fun of me.  You are kissing her fat,  pregnant ass.  You know, see,  we did it in character  like Mr. Armand.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  He used his character.  Okay, great.  Well, you're right, I guess.  Shout out to Jim Norton.  You're right up his alley.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  You made me really happy.  I don't understand  what bit he's talking about.  Sometimes people break  into the studio,  record funny things.  Right.  When we play them.  The latest Christopher Reeve  picture is up on WNEW.  I heard you guys  talking about this one.  I lost his eyebrows.  So Whoopi Goldberg  don't have no eyebrows?  I never noticed.  And she's always 
[01:49:00]  having sex with somebody.  White guys.  She likes the white guys.  Have you seen the ads  for Planet of the...  Planet of the...  Have you seen the ads  for Planet of the Apes?  What's with that segue?  Yeah, very appropriate.  Yeah.  What's with that segue, man?  What is this?  Oh, God.  Damn.  I'm joking.  I'm doing the parody  of the guy that would  actually say that,  like Al Campanis.  Planet of the Apes.  Go ahead.  Have you seen  Michael Clark Duncan?  Yeah.  The character?  Yeah.  It looks like  Michael Clark Duncan  in an ape suit. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, my God.  Like, the original  was like 40 years ago  and the apes,  like, you didn't know...  I'm like,  I still watch it go,  though.  Who's Roddy McDowell?  Like, what's going on?  Yeah, which one?  You don't know  which one he wants.  They're on the cover  of the magazine.  It's like,  what, they just have  a zipper up the back?  Hey, where's the big guy?  Put him in the suit,  not.  Chalk it up.  Suit, not.  Let's get it, Doug.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  AJ, how you doing, buddy?  Hey, what's up?  Big fan.  Does Kelly know  you have a sperm count  of a small turtle? 
[01:50:00]  I think that's what she likes  when she started  from Mexican  getting her pregnant.  All right.  All right, buddy.  Take it easy, pal.  She knows I can release  and, you know,  she can enjoy it for the day.  AJ is quick  to be at Rascal's  all weekend, right?  Yeah.  Like, if you don't  want to get pregnant,  you know,  if a guy's got  a real high sperm count  and you have an accident  in there,  it's like,  oh, God,  you know,  they're in the sink  in two seconds,  you know what I mean?  In the sink?  Yeah, but if they know,  like me,  I get the sperm count  of, like, you know, 
[01:50:30]  a puppy.  What are the odds?  You know,  what are the odds?  So they can actually  enjoy the map of Hawaii  all day.  As they go about  their business  and make deals  across the desk,  they know that they got  that inside them  and that's their  little secret  for the day.  And I challenge women  to call me  and tell me  they don't do that.  Well, Lord.  Go to work  just full.  Oh, man.  Go to work full.  Sploshing full.  Right.  Right, Jay?  Jay, quite frankly,  I'm confused  where you're going to be.  You're going to be  at Rascals.  Two shows tomorrow, 
[01:51:00]  two shows Friday  at which one?  West Orange.  Oh, West Orange.  Two shows tomorrow  at West Orange.  All right,  and two shows Friday  at West Orange.  But this is where  we're going to confuse  all the work here.  Saturday, I'm going to Ocean.  Yeah, but that's where  everyone's going to get  confused now in their car.  Why?  They can't handle  too much information sometimes.  I'm at Rascals all weekend,  either one.  There you go.  But two shows tomorrow  and Friday  at the West Orange Rascals.  We'll start there.  Yeah, I got a lot  of new stuff, too, man.  I got like 20 minutes  of new stuff.  Good stuff.  You're doing  the satin sheets bit?  I think that one's 
[01:51:30]  going to peak  with Ripper tomorrow.  Oh, oh, oh.  Because it's...  You first did it  on our show.  We feel privileged.  Ah.  Because you try it out  on our show  and now you're going  to try it on national TV.  Well, what better audience  to try it out on  than the two guys  that do comedy  for a living?  Look at that.  We're like the batting cage.  I like it.  Yeah, but you give me  the high heat  and I can't fool around  and I can't strike out.  I know.  What if we were  making believe  it was funny, though?  No, we wouldn't do that.  No, but I know  it's funny.  I was doing it  in the clothes.  I was doing it 
[01:52:00]  out in the rooms.  Out in the rooms?  I'm doing it  out in the rooms.  Trying out your stuff.  Did you have a stool  with it written down  on a piece of paper?  No, God.  Like that,  you mean Garofalo?  I hate that crap.  Oh.  I tell, like,  I'll see somebody do it  and go,  you got three new jokes.  You wrote them.  You can't remember them?  Yeah.  Well, that's her whole bit.  How she's working  out some new stuff,  but it's the same stuff  from five years ago.  What I think is cool  is to have, like,  10 minutes of new stuff  and a 20-minute set  and just mixing it in  and having everybody  go along for the ride.  If something doesn't work,  don't go,  oh, that's new.  It sucks.  Just go like, 
[01:52:30]  no, no, that's the part  of the ride  where it's a little slow.  Just keep going right here.  Look, here's an old joke.  It always helps  if a joke doesn't work.  Just wish cancer  on the audience.  That's what I'm on your side.  I found that worked  for me very well.  You tell them  you hope they get cancer?  Many times, yeah.  So if you do a new joke,  you're like,  blah, blah, blah,  and then I hit her  in there with a shovel.  I've told an audience  that I want to put  AIDS in a hose  and spray them.  I go to work full.  You should get cancer.  I hope you'll get cancer. 
[01:53:00]  Talk to my son.  Talk to my grandson.  My grandson.  You should only get cancer.  You should only get cancer.  I hope you'll get cancer.  Where's this from?  Go back to your legend.  Why bother you people  when you're eating?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Go back to your legend.  Oh.  What the hell was that?  This is the greatest  federal case  since the Lindbergh baby  and you're asking me  nothing better. 
[01:53:30]  Enough with the soup.  I don't like the in-laws.  Oh.  Go back to your legend.  One of the best comedies ever.  A classic ever.  You know,  it's not in the AFI's  top 100 comedy.  It's just ridiculous.  And it's the funniest movie  I've ever seen.  It's one of the funniest  comedy ever.  Serpentine Kelly.  Serpentine.  Serpentine.  Serpentine.  Serpentine Kelly.  Which list is number one  on that list?  They're not in any particular.  Taddy Shack 2.  It's like, you know.  Oh, Taddy Shack 2.  Singing in the Rain.  It's like,  Singing in the Rain.  What was funny about that?  No, but it's amazing.  It's an amazing movie,  but.  It stinks.  No, it doesn't, man. 
[01:54:00]  It doesn't.  That guy O'Connor,  what was his name?  And what?  Make Em Laugh.  He does a song,  Make Em Laugh.  Donald O'Connor.  Donald O'Connor.  That guy was unbelievable.  Singing is not funny.  Amistad was funnier  and singing in the Rain.  Oh, my God.  Of course,  all the songs are funny.  Oh, give us free.  That black lawyer?  That was hilarious.  Jody.  Woo.  What a doodle.  It's the Greaseman Show.  Bone dry, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Snarlins, Negroes.  We'll be back with more  of the Greaseman Show  following these words.  Always funny.  Oh, man.  Always.  What a doodle.  Hey, we should talk about  that Toyota commercial,  speaking of the Greaseman.  Yeah, that's what popped  in my head.  Toyota's getting in trouble  all the time  because of their ads.  I think they have  an insensitive ad department.  You guys got to hear this one.  Now we can get a 401k.  Is it that one?  No, it was this big ad,  a print ad, 
[01:55:00]  that was being put out  in specifically black magazines.  You know,  it had like Ebony and Jet,  and it showed this big  black guy's lips  smiling  and on his front tooth  was gold  and it was in the shape  of a Toyota Corolla  or something.  And they found that  they were like,  they thought it was racist.  I just think it's,  you know,  that's really nice.  It bothers me  if white people  thought it was racist  and brought it  to everybody's attention.  If it's in black magazines  and black people 
[01:55:30]  are going,  yo,  that tooth is hype.  Like my man  with the Toyota tooth.  Oh man,  look at you  with the Toyota tooth.  inflate to 30 PSI  and his lips  had nothing to do  with it,  right?  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Nice.  Not Jay Moore.  But the problem  was that they had,  that was not Jay Moore.  They have kind of  a reputation  for doing that  because there was  another ad  that was in  the black publications  that said,  what the hell did it say?  It said,  oh,  unlike your boyfriend,  Toyota gets up  in the morning.  So they thought 
[01:56:00]  it was saying.  What was the one  with the black couple?  They got like a,  it was some,  I thought it was  like a car.  Yeah.  And they're like,  now we can get  a 401k.  Yeah,  I think that was  Toyota too.  Yeah.  Yeah,  they're really  insensitive.  I think,  I don't see any problem  with it.  I don't think  they're all that  over the top,  but they seem  a little pissed off.  I was just thinking,  you know,  what a doodle Toyota,  extra grip steering wheel  so you can eat  fried chicken  and dry without slipping.  What a doodle.  Bone dry,  bone dry,  plenty of room  for the watermelon  in the trunk. 
[01:56:30]  Pool six.  Drag six.  Bone dry,  yeah.  Snarling.  Whenever I fly  like from LA to New York,  you take the ride out,  there's always like  celebrities on the plane  and I do like  a celebrity check  to see who,  because I want to see  if I'm going to make  the paper  if the plane goes down,  you know?  Like I was on the plane  with like Alec Baldwin  and Jason Seahorn  last time.  You're done.  I'm in the paper  if that one goes down  because,  you know,  it's a giant  and an actor,  you know?  Yeah.  Like,  and you know,  that'll be at least,  even if I'm not in the paper,  people go,  oh,  you know who else  was on that flight.  You know what I mean? 
[01:57:00]  I'd be one of those.  But for it to be big news,  you've got to be alone.  Yeah,  but I'm not famous enough  for if I'm alone,  it's like,  oh my God,  this guy,  they're going to be like,  well,  so do three hundred  people.  Screw.  Oh,  so you need a celebrity  on board  to get the magazine.  to latch onto.  Just when stoners  are sitting around  talking about  when Alec Baldwin  and Seahorn went down,  they'll be like,  you know,  who else is on that flight?  Jay Moore.  So I get on the flight.  The guy from Cherry Falls.  I get on the flight  and I'm thinking to myself,  because once I was on a flight  with like Stevie Wonder 
[01:57:30]  and I'm like,  I'm in.  This is great.  Stevie Wonder goes down,  I'm going down right here.  Right.  Then I was on with Tiger Woods'  father and Jim Gray  coming back from the Super Bowl.  I was like,  this one's good.  I get on the plane last night,  right?  11 o'clock at night,  we're a little delayed.  I go on,  I'm looking around,  I don't notice anybody,  notice anybody,  and somebody behind me goes,  could I have your autograph?  I look and I see a celebrity.  It's Caroline Ray.  Caroline Ray.  And that's when I knew  we were going down.  No one would ever find out.  No one would know.  Caroline Ray from 
[01:58:00]  Hollywood Square.  Sabrina,  the teenage witch.  I thought,  wow,  we're doomed.  If anyone behind First Class  has any idea  how doomed they are,  stampede now.  We got a guy from  an ad agency  that knows the scoop  on the Toyota.  All right.  Damien,  black people in Toyota.  What's up, Damien?  Yeah,  most car companies,  I work for a different one,  have a minority ad agency  which does all those  type of ads.  So white people  aren't involved.  Yeah,  you got to target 
[01:58:30]  your demo,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And you can't have a bunch  of white guys  doing ads for black people.  Yeah,  but you can't oppose them  either.  Even if it's awful,  you can't go back  and say,  this is some racist crap.  Well,  Jesse Jackson  doesn't like it.  That's what it is.  He's talking about...  So a black person  came up with the ad  with the RAV4 on the tooth?  Probably.  I imagine.  I heard for their next ad  they actually have  a bunch of white guys  in sheets  and a Toyota  hanging from a tree.  Call.  Not anymore. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  Mark,  what's going on?  Yeah,  what's up,  man?  What's up?  Hey,  more.  What's up?  What's up?  Why did you call  Ahmad Rashad racist?  Because he's a racist prick.  Like,  what happened?  Give me an example.  What did he do?  He doesn't like white people.  Wait,  where did this come from?  It came from  the last appearance  on the show.  Oh,  okay.  All right,  but what's up  with Ahmad Rashad?  What happened?  I bumped into him  and I felt  very uncomfortable  with the amount  of anger  and hatred  that I felt  coming out of him  towards most people 
[01:59:30]  he was around,  not just myself.  And I've seen  the way he acts  around other people  on a stage  that happened  to be white  and I just think  he doesn't have  love in his heart.  I think he's  Malcolm before Mecca  type of man.  Really?  Really?  And you guys  have a lot of love  in your heart  for blacks  up in that studio,  right?  Yeah.  My godson's black,  buddy.  What of it?  Oh,  yeah?  Yeah,  he's a hot black  chick in here.  He's a cool guy,  too.  Really cool guy.  And I've spent  a lot of money  on black prostitutes. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  All right,  Jim Norton.  You guys are the best,  man.  O&A.  Keep going.  All right,  man.  See you later,  buddy.  Bye.  That was an easy  battle to win.  We've got to take a break.  Do you guys have  love in your heart?  Love in our heart.  Yes, we do.  Someone is requesting  Bob Murphy today  because he's in the hospital.  Bob Murphy in the hospital.  I know you did Bob Murphy.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do it next.  Bob Murphy.  We'll do it next.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah,  you can do Bob Shepard.  He'll do Bob.

[02:01:00]  Ron and Fez.  Fez gets back to nature.  Hey, Fez,  how was Central Park?  It was beautiful, Ronnie.  I enjoyed the trees.  I enjoyed the squirrels.  I even enjoyed  a couple of little swallows.  I didn't know  you liked bird watching.  Who said anything  about birds?  You sick c*****.  How the hell  can you do that?  Well,  it's no day in the park.  Actually, Fez,  it was.  How ironic.  All on the next,  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  Middays,  noon to 3, 
[02:01:30]  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Stacker 2,  the world's strongest  fat burner, Anthony.  Yes, it's spring,  and before you start  to peel off the laser  about clothes,  peel off the fat.  Stacker 2,  the world's strongest  fat burner.  Do you know who  used Stacker 2  very successfully?  You just saw him.  La Machine.  La Machine.  He's kept the weight off  because he lost the weight  a while ago now.  Absolutely did.  I think he lost 70 pounds  with the help of Stacker 2.  Yeah.  He did other things, too,  I'm sure.  I'm sure he did a little  exercising, too,  right, La Machine?  Yes, sir.  And the Stacker 2 
[02:02:00]  helped give you  the energy you needed  All the energy I needed  to get through the workout.  Now, look at you.  Nah, 80 pounds later.  80 pounds.  It was 80 pounds.  Yes, it is.  80 pounds.  Nice.  Nicey nice.  Does that mean  you're going to be able  to hit the softball  a little better this year?  You know, Al, you know.  It was our coach, you know.  Yeah, me.  Rick was in charge of that team.  I was merely a figurehead.  I was merely a figurehead.  Rick wouldn't let me do anything. 
[02:02:30]  Nice right fielder, you got it.  What?  Who?  Miss a perfectly good fly ball.  Huh, Bill?  Hey, Bill, I think he's ragging you.  Why?  I missed a perfectly good fly ball  from Earl.  Oh, 11.  Because you stuck me  in right field.  Oh, yeah, I can't play.  So you couldn't hurt us.  But you ended up hurting us.  Well, the rematch...  What do you mean?  I wrapped in a couple of runs  and then I scored.  You faked that friggin' injury  the first time up at bat, Rick.  Really?  Oh, my man.  Right out.  I'm very injured.  I hurt myself.  I had two hits old. 
[02:03:00]  My tampon was too tight.  All right.  None of this is making me air.  It looks like he's dying of age.  Oh, God.  There's a rousing endorsement  for Saka, too.  It'll look like you're dying of AIDS.  Look at him.  Take Saka and get the AIDS.  It'll look like...  It'll look ugly  because you have too much AIDS.  Oh, yeah.  It'll look like Norton opened up  the hose of AIDS  and sprayed you.  So a la machine, 80 pounds.  What the hell is Saka 2?  80 pounds.  You can, too.  It's great.  It cuts down on the appetite  so you don't eat like a pig. 
[02:03:30]  If you want to lose 10 pounds  or 100 pounds,  Saka 2 works.  Log on now.  Saka 2.  The number 2.com.

Get ready for  who's about  who's about  who's about  who's about  who's about  who's about  in the studio  a bunch of guys. 
[02:04:00]  Bunch of guys.  Too many names  to mention at this point.  We just call it  bunch of guys.  I have a problem  with John's pants.  The intern.  Uh-oh.  Like Finky said,  it looks like he shopped  at the Asian Dap store.  What?  It looks like he's ready  for Fire Island  with these pants.  Oh.  Have you checked out  the pants on John today?  No, let me say.  John, get in here.  I can proudly say  I have not checked  out John's pants.  How could you not  miss them, though?  John.  Let me say.  Those slip past me  also, Anthony.  No, let me say.  Look at his pants. 
[02:04:30]  What is it?  Whoa.  They called culots.  They called culots  back in the 70s.  I bet they make  your ass hurt.  I think when you  last night, baby.  Looks like what  the Heinys used to wear  working on the railroad  back in the 1800s.  You just need that  pointy hat.  I'm not talking  about a guy  that worked  in the railroad.  Knock that  cheek a day's paper  napping on the job.  Stinky, you have  a paw with John's 
[02:05:00]  pants, right?  Oh, God.  They look like  a girl's pants.  Oh.  Oh, man.  They look like  capri pants.  They are, yeah.  Capri pants.  I've never seen a guy  wear these pants  ever.  No.  No.  Look at Stinky  with the line.  Not since Spanky  from The Little Rascals.  Didn't Spanky  wear knickers?  Shouldn't he be  holding a lantern  in someone's front yard?  Are they pants  or are they shorts?  What are they?  That's the question.  They're actually, uh...  I don't know. 
[02:05:30]  They're called three-quarter pants.  Three-quarter pants.  Three-quarter pants.  That's the gay...  That's all you need to know  as far as the gayness  of those pants  if they're called  three-quarter gay pants.  Three-quarter pants.  When you buy pants  like that,  your T-cell count  automatically drops.  Look at us not being hip  because we don't know  about the three-quarter pants.  Wow.  It's a new thing  in the gas now.  Three-quarter pants  for a full-size pants.  They called you  into those, huh?  Those are great, aren't you?  That's when...  You know what those  pants are for?  It's when you really  want to wear shorts  but you don't want  to chafe your knees  in front of a glory hole. 
[02:06:00]  So it gives you  that extra material.  Nice.  Glory hole.  Very nice.  Glory hole.  Very nice.  Tim Norton loves  glory hole references.  All the pleasure  without having to make  eye contact.  Those are for riding horses.  Yeah.  You want to wear shorts  but you don't want  to chafe your knee  on the saddle.  Yeah.  For riding iron.  Not as funny as...  What?  What, Chuck?  Chuck was comparing me  to the iron chic, actually.  Iron chic pants.  Put the little curly  shoes on them.  Have them sit  like Indian style 
[02:06:30]  as well as Claremont.  You ain't there!  They'd have to be  a little more ballooned  and then you'd have  hammer pants.  Hey, they look good  on you, though, huh?  Yeah.  They look good  on you, though.  What?  Did you get a free  ball suit with those pants?  I don't get nothing  in like it.  And set my friend  Wang up with the  whole smear.  It's really good.  It's two blocks  to the look.  All right,  Payne Stewart.  Thank you.  It's hard being a  trendsetter. 
[02:07:00]  Trendsetter?  Oh, man.  I almost set it.  The last time I heard  that in this studio,  we fired somebody.  Remember good old  Jesse, the trendsetter?  You look like a  daisy chainsetter.  You set the trend  for who's been  in front of the day,  boy.  There he goes.  I guess the three-quarter  pants are happy.  Three-quarter pants,  hoping.  What do you know?  What do I know?  Is he going to not  wear them anymore  or are you going to  continue to wear them  in defiance?  He'll be stubborn  and continue to wear them.  I hope he continues  to wear them.  They had a big sale. 
[02:07:30]  Buy these pants  and prove your gag reflex.  Tim Norton,  comedy seller,  11 o'clock at night.  The world famous  Greenwich Village.  Where you see  three-quarter pants  a lot, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In the village.  He's really terrorist  in the audience.  I threw Jay Moore's  plugs out,  but I think it's  Rascals,  two shows tomorrow,  two shows Friday  at Rascals and West Ars  and then he goes  to the other Rascals.  It's not confusing.  I'm only in Ocean  one day, Saturday.  Saturday, okay.  And then everything else 
[02:08:00]  is...  What about Sunday?  Sunday, back to West Orange.  Gotcha.  You got to go back  to the home crowd.  Thursday, Friday,  Sunday, West Orange.  Saturday, Rascals South  in Ocean Township.  Thank you.  Once again, Paul,  you have crystallized  my thoughts eloquently.  Now, as David Letterman  would say.  He called me...  Oh, okay.  Wait a minute.  He said something  where I think  I need a compass.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  South, I'm heading  which way?  Right.  South.  Okay.  Where is that?  What are you talking about?  Is that the one in Orange?  South?  Oh.  Ocean.  Ocean is South.  Ocean is... 
[02:08:30]  West Orange is North.  South up here, yes, sir.  Okay.  By the way,  Saturday is actually  three-quarter pants night  in Ocean Township  for the ladies.  Yeah, it's...  There's going to be  a lot of hot chicks  there, so you guys  are going to come.  Ah, good.  As one club owner said  to Jay Moore Crowd,  the guys wear the good  t-shirts and the girls  are always hot.  Good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I hope  Kelly Ripa goes.  All right, listen,  we've got to talk about  Bob Murphy in the hospital.  Yeah, poor Bob Murphy.  Best of Bob Murphy.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
[02:09:00]  please welcome  a Broadcasting  Hall of Famer  Bob  Murphy.  Don't thank you  very much.  He's got pneumonia  or something,  but I think he went  to the hospital and said,  I think my leg  is hurting.  Oh, wait,  it's my lungs?  They missed it.  Egg by Eddie,  back, back,  and that one's  out of here.  Oh, brud.  Oh, he caught it?  Have you heard  that clip?  We can't play it anymore  because the faggots  at the fan won't let us  play that clip.  Bob Murphy stinks. 
[02:09:30]  Oh.  Yeah, he stinks.  We can play the clip.  I got a whole tape  of Bob Murphy.  No, we'll play the clip.  Oh, the calorie guy  flying by a leap  in the middle.  Here's the clip.  Here's the clip.  He's telling that kid  in his pants tonight.  This is a very  embarrassing moment  for Bob Murphy.  The pitch.  High slide one.  The piece  left-footer field  was way back.  It may be playable.  Egg by Eddie.  Hit in a play. 
[02:10:00]  It's gone.  A home run.  Oh, he caught it.  He caught it at the wall.  I was sure  he was unable to reach it.  It's caught by Egg by Eddie.  I apologize.  He was way out there  and it didn't look like  he had a play on it,  but he caught it  against the wall  in left-center field.  Look, if you're way out there,  then you would have  a play on it.  Right.  He was so close  to the ball  because of the amount  of real estate he covered.  I didn't think he got it.  Bob Murphy should have  a cup of prostate cancer 
[02:10:30]  thrown on him.  Oh, God damn.  Easy.  Easy, man.  Not making the  head fans happy.  My blood pressure  right now is  nine over five.  There's a pop-up.  Cedeno.  Gone!  There's a  slow-rolling  grounder.  Just a second.  Wait.  Oh, no.  It's home run.  Wait a minute.  I haven't even  gotten out of bed yet.  I'm still home.  That ball  hooking.  Ball one. 
[02:11:00]  My dump  going  into the bedpan.  No, wait.  He missed it.  It's all over my bed.  Rafael Santana  picked up a dead bird.  Debbie, what's your  problem?  I take offense to  anybody that says  anything bad about  Bob Murphy.  He's the best.  What about Bob Murphy?  Thank you, Hilda.  You're saying that  he sucks.  Thank you, Christine.  I love you.  Wait a minute.  Thank you, Barbara.  Jim Norton said he  sucks.  I did.  And he's going to be  the comedy teller at  11 o'clock.  You can tell him  face-to-face.  Yeah, I never said 
[02:11:30]  Bob Murphy sucks.  I love  listening to him.  Jim Norton said  that he sucks,  and I love  Bob Murphy.  No, I apologize.  If you want to come  down, you can talk  to me face-to-ball  bag.  How do you know  I'm not sure?  Why don't you  just shut up,  you bitch?  Oh, wait a minute.  I like her.  Thank you very much.  I'm giving respect  to Bob Murphy.  What's in your pants?  What's in my pants?  Yeah, rub the phone  on your phone.  That old gag.  That old gag.  Let's say what's  in your pants.  We haven't played  that in a long time.  I'm a Bob Murphy fan. 
[02:12:00]  I'm telling you  right now,  it looks like  Abraham Lincoln.  No, no, no.  Try Hitler Mustache.  I'm going to say  Fidel Castro  eating a London Royal.  No, no, man.  Somebody drop  the pork shop  on the barbershop floor.  Try Hitler Mustache.  Hey, Debbie.  Yeah.  Rehashed it.  Thank God.  It would have been  gone forever.  The pork shop.  All right, Debbie.  Thank you.  Silly putty.  She goes,  Try hitting the mustache. 
[02:12:30]  Is that  when I say  I go more?  Try hitting the mustache.  I heard my eyebrows  fell out.  What happened to me?  A wheelchair ridden.  Oh, wait,  they didn't?  Bud,  what's going on?  You forgot  Bob's claim  to fame  at Bowling for Dollars.  I remember  Bowling for Dollars  with Bob Murphy.  The best part  was when the guy  had no shot  and the ball  was going in the gutter  and he always said,  Come back,  come back,  come back. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah,  come back,  come back.  Oh,  it's a gutter ball.  Oh,  wait,  did you strike?  Do you remember  who replaced him?  Harry Kenny,  another giant  in the industry  you should mention.  Wow,  you got some trivia.  Look at that.  Bowling for Dollars.  Here's the home  of the silo.  Take use,  you guys.  Hey,  you do it pretty well.  Oh,  I've got to get a life,  I guess.  You sound like  the young,  healthy one,  though.  You're going to sound  like the old  slivered one.  The guy still,  I won't run it 
[02:13:30]  and he smokes  like a sieve.  Trust me,  I know it.  Yeah.  It's a beautiful  day for baseball.  Oh,  it's winter,  season's over.  Lime is snowing.  Oh,  hell,  I'm at the jet game.  I got a videotape  of all baseball  like guys rushing  them out and stuff  but a lot of it's  Bob Murphy  and a lot of it's  Harry Carey.  Is there a way  I can just make it  an audio tape  like in the studio here?  Oh, 
[02:14:00]  that'll rock.  Look at Harry Carey  going,  he was always  like in mid-chug.  It had to be,  if you sip it  you can get back  on track.  He must have been like,  I'm going to put  this beer down  before anybody  realizes  I'm drinking  a shot.  First is grace,  it's out.  The ball like rolls  to the,  the ball literally  rolls to the wall  at Wrigley  into the brick wall.  He goes,  there's a shot, 
[02:14:30]  gone.  Third,  grace,  safe.  Oh,  because grace  is out.  Third,  first,  grace,  safe.  Ah,  Hideki,  ah,  ah,  boo.  Aruba,  I think  the proper  pronunciation  Harry is  Arabu,  or whatever  the name,  George Steinbrenner  has an excellent  opportunity  to fatten up  his Japanese  pitcher's record. 
[02:15:00]  On tape.  I want to hear that.  Sully,  what's going on?  What's up,  fellas?  Hey.  You ever hear him  cough up the  lone cookies  on the air?  Oh,  yeah.  He'll go off  mic,  and you'll hear  like a coughing  in the back.  Then you'll hear  the bing,  you know,  like someone  runs with a  bucket.  Hey,  I'm still  drinking that.  With the  scourge  head,  five,  five.  Hey,  Bob.  Hey,  hey. 
[02:15:30]  How about  I buy  a new fly?  Call her  the lungs,  Bob.  The exercise  will get  some blood.  There's a  home run  by Henry.  The exercise  will help you.  I love  exercise.  Got a lot  of fluid  backed up  in my lungs.  My epiglottis  is like  a pool skimmer  flap.  Well,  the exercise  will loosen  up all 
[02:16:00]  the flames.  As all  the flam  loose,  the benches  are cleared.  I just  made an epiglottis  joke,  Norton.  I know,  but I was  more ashamed  of myself  that I  broke  from Harry  Carey  into  little  Nicky.  Hey,  how about  I buy  you fly?  Effective.  Melissa,  what's going  on?  Melissa.  Hello.  Hi.  What do  you have  to add  to this  myth?  All right.  The way  Bob Murphy  says  Colorado  Rockies, 
[02:16:30]  Colorado Rockies,  it's terrible.  Colorado Rockies.  It's like,  ugh,  mouthful of  phlegm.  And also,  Alfonzo is like,  Alfonzo.  He is like,  extra L in there  somewhere.  Alfonzo.  Exactly.  He's from the  Dominican Republic.  And where's  number nine?  Nine backwards  is in  in there.  The Mets  would like  to get 
[02:17:00]  back in  this  in there  in there  in there  ballgame.  Galarraga  backwards  is Galarraga.  Why does  the coach  have his  clothes off?  Brian,  what's going  on?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Brian,  go.  Speak.  Go.  You're on the  road.  Harrelson,  only second.  Oh,  he can fly.  Oh,  yeah.  Forgot about  that one, 
[02:17:30]  huh?  Bob Murphy  always says,  oh,  he can fly.  I'm Bob  Murphy and  Lindsey Nelson.  Thanks for  calling.  You know,  Bob,  Ray or  Dornia's  is bad  has certainly  come around  for the  match,  but they're  losing games.  maybe  you'd rather  have the  guy  not hit  a lick  and just  let the  big,  I can't do  a little  Nicky. 
[02:18:00]  Let the  big guys  knock the  ball right  out of the  park.  He's got the  little Nicky  down,  man.  Oh,  Jesus.  Very funny.  Steve  Trashle.  Mike Hampton  looks like  a gay  curious  children.  Joe,  what's up?  Hey,  guys.  Oh,  yes.  Hi,  Joe.  Brutal.  I'm going  to be a  rascal.  All of  them all  weekend long. 
[02:18:30]  Joe,  what's on  your mind?  Hey,  guys.  I'm just  wondering if  maybe there's  a Beyond  the Glory  in the works  for Bob  Murphy  and Harry  Carey.  Thanks for  getting us  back on  track.  Good night.  Stinky rules,  guys.  All right.  That was  Stinky from  the other  studio.  Yeah,  Stinky's the  best out.  All the  ladies loving  the Bob  Murphy and  the Harry  Carey.  A man who  once drank  eight beers  in a single  inning.  A man who  could have  five steaks  and two  bottles of  wine.  A man who  could drink 
[02:19:00]  crystal meth  and liquid  acid and  the lauded  the  Hibonol.  Every drug  under the  sun.  NyQuil,  Robitussin,  and still  get on the  mic night  after night  after night  with  flem in  his lungs.  This is  Bob Murphy  beyond the  glory.  Harry  Carey was a  man that  didn't recognize  his own  sons.  fans loved  him.  And then  tragedy.  I remember  one time I 
[02:19:30]  was in a  bar in  St.  Petersburg  during,  it was  either the  playoffs or  spring  training.  And I  remember I  found a  prostitute with  Bob Murphy.  Bob, do you  remember that  gal?  I remember  her.  We tag  teamed her.  It was kind  of ice.  We put her  out of the  rotisserie and  played pinocle on  her back.  That's what I  wanted to talk  about,  Bob.  I'm not done 
[02:20:00]  with that.  Bob had the  front end, if  you will.  Someone just  put a wet  back down my  windpipe.  We'll get to  it.  I had the  back end and  realized halfway  through that  that she  had a  penis.  Harry  Carey  definitely  sporting the  high hard one 
[02:20:30]  that night.  You're not  lying, Bob  Murphy.  One thing  to count.  I always  said that  one.  Bob, look at  this kid over  here.  Look at the  prize on the  girl's face  when I hacked  a loogie on  her back and  she thought I  was finished.  She spun  around and I  gave it to  her.  Both barrels.  You're watching  Beyond the  Glory, Bob  Murphy and  Harry Carey. 
[02:21:00]  Ever notice  when you sit  out in the  sun a long  time, your  head gets  pink.  You would  think that your  hair would act  some kind  of buffer  to the  sun, but  it doesn't  happen.  Hey, Stuart  just knocked  out Frank  Robinson.  There's a  1-0.  What is a  fax machine  and why is  it so 
[02:21:30]  magical?  Ever  drive with  your left  hand and  realize,  hey,  I've  been  driving with  my left  hand for a  long time.  And you  switched for  absolutely no  reason.  I've never  been hit in  the face with  a baseball,  but I'm  sure Kevin  Sykes is  going to  feel some  pain after  that pitch.  I remember  that night  with that  hose bag.  She had  four balls 
[02:22:00]  on her and  she wasn't  walking  anywhere.  Hey, how  about when we  made her walk  to the vending  machine because  we wanted her to  do that trick  with the  Clark  bar.  Nothing  better than  double  penetration.  I can't  believe you  ate the  whole thing.  That's a  worm,  somebody.  Araboo.  Rico  Brodner is  going to  bat for  Bobby  Bonilla.  Bonilla  it's 
[02:22:30]  spelled,  but it's  Bonilla  nonetheless.  Holy  Jesus.  Bobby  Bonilla  just shoved  Jeremy  Burnett  right in  the  kisser.  You know,  I have a  Rockaway  bed and  my friends  are all on  stack or two,  but you don't  mix it with  beer, so it  doesn't really  work with me.  Hideki  Araboo just  pulled his  pants down  and relieved  himself on the  mound. 
[02:23:00]  When I drink  the stack or  two, it goes  right through  me.  Bob, the  color in your  face is  draining.  It's the  pneumonia.  Mneumonia.  Maybe we  should take  him to go  see my  father.  That's not a  bad idea,  little  Mickey.  Anymore  liquid in my  lungs, I'm  going to need  gills.  Oh, I  have them?  Oh, I  don't.  I thought  you guys  were going  to go to  heaven because  of all the  good things  you did.  After the 
[02:23:30]  story with  the hooker  and the  Clark  bar, I  kind of  have no  choice.  Send us  where you  will, little  man.  Just root,  root, root  for the  coffee.  You're  watching  Little  Nicky, Harry  Carey, and  Bob Murphy  Beyond the  Glory.  Speaking of  glory, remember  that glory  hole you were  in front of  with your  three-quarter  pants, Harry.  I remember  it like it  was yesterday.  I didn't 
[02:24:00]  know they  were three-quarter  pants, Bob.  I thought  they just  didn't fit.  Here I am  walking around  all night  thinking I'm  a horse's  ass because  my clothes  don't fit,  home plates  on fire.  Turns out  I'm wearing  three-quarter  pants.  Ladies and  gentlemen,  anyone with  three-quarter  pants?  Weineger, 
[02:24:30]  Butch  Weineger.  Butch  Weineger is  gay.  That's Dave  Winfield.  Wow.  Long,  strong,  black arms  stroking.  Speaking of  long,  black arms,  Barry  Barnes holds  that bat  like it  weighs about  one ounce.  That's it. 
[02:25:00]  Erin,  what's going  on?  Hey,  the funniest  thing is when  they just  ran out of  things to say  during the game  and they just  start making  fun of people.  I like  vaginas.  We're there  a fake in  Montreal last  week and  they just  started wailing  on how nobody  ever comes to  the games and  how there's so  many empty  seats.  That's what  they got to  do.  I wonder  why.  I can't  understand why  there's not  more people  here.  I saw more 
[02:25:30]  people out  of the glory  hole last  night to pitch  high and wide  for ball two.  I don't  understand  these  Mets,  Bob.  Here's a  tip.  Just last  year pushed  the Yankees  to the brink  of elimination  in game  two of the  World Series.  And they  get a  Japanese guy  to replace  Mike Hampton. 
[02:26:00]  Shooji.  They had  Masato  Yoshii.  I guess  you're only  allowed one  Japanese man  per team  in the  National League  because we  know that  the Seattle  Mariners are  chock full of  Japanese players.  Suzuki,  Suzuki,  Suzuki,  Suzuki.  Eat,  eat,  eat,  eat your  lunch.  Eat your,  he'll be  rookie of the  year probably.  Eat,  eat,  eat,  eat your, 
[02:26:30]  eat,  way inside  the Gutierrez.  Wow.  Hey,  hey,  Bob.  Here's  Harry.  When did  he take you  off of that  bag?  Well,  my colostomy  bag is quite  full of the  time.  Full of my  own feces,  which I will  throw at you  right now.  Oh,  I can?  If I could make  a request,  sir,  could you  throw it on  me?  I'm the 
[02:27:00]  devil's son.  That movie's  one of the  most underrated  movies I've  ever seen.  Really?  I love  Little Man.  I gotta  check it  out.  I laugh.  So I was  in a hotel  room watching  it and I  didn't know  there was  no one  there.  Georgia Tech.  Don't confuse  them.  Just rascals,  everybody.  All right.  Cool.  We have to  take a break.  Yeah.  Bravo to  Jane Moore.  So I threw  the hotel  station area  across the room  because I  didn't know  how to  react.  I was  like a  black person  in the  front row  of the  Apollo. 
[02:27:30]  I was  laughing so  hard I was  just picking  up furniture  and throwing  it.  Those windows  do not break.  If you were  like a black  person you  would have  picked up  luggage and  jumped on  us.  That was  not Jane  Moore.  That was  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton,  comedy teller,  11 o'clock.  Niger Energy  to meet you  there.  Adam,  what's going  on?  Hey,  man,  I cannot  believe how  funny that  is.  I almost  asked myself  in the  car,  man.  I'm  sitting here  and I  almost got  in four  accidents.  Jane  Moore is  the funniest  guy alive.  Go see 
[02:28:00]  Matt Rascals  this weekend.  You got it.  Starting  tomorrow night,  two shows,  two shows  Friday.  Hey,  thank you.  See you  later,  boys.  Think you  suck.  Thanks for  the plug.  There's  nothing like  a young  guy driving  in his car  taking a dump  in his car  because no one  else on the  road has  any idea.  I do it  all the  time.  But see,  I sit next  to you  and I  know it.  But when  you're in  your car,  no one  knows it.  Hi, 
[02:28:30]  this is Bob  Murphy for  Dependent  Undergarments.  I'm wearing  them right  now.  Oh,  I'm not?  Oh,  hell,  I just  crap myself.  No,  you're not,  Bob.  You're not  wearing them  at all.  It's all  over the  console.  I forgot  to change  my nightie.  Doug,  guys,  this bit  is so  replacing  who was  on first  in the  baseball  hole.  Did you  kill me  with the  you do  four balls  you can't  even  watch.  Where's  my boy's  life? 
[02:29:00]  Later.  I  had a  boy's  life  magazine.  I  think  little  Nicky  stole  it  from me.  I  don't  know  if  I'm  doing  Harry  Carey  or  Martin  Short  doing  somebody  else.  It's  been  real  spitting.  Jackie  Evans  Jr.  I  must  say.  We  got to  take a  break.  Yeah,  look at  the  time.  Someone  is  begging  to get  this  on  Napster  immediately.  Someone  will  do  it.  Hey,  hopefully 
[02:29:30]  I  noticed  you  wear  headphones  while  you  do  your  radio  program.  What  are  the  headphones  about?  What  are  you  listening  to?  What's  the  big  secret?  here's  a guy  who does  radio  for a  living  and he's  listening to  something else  in the  headphones.  What's  in the  headphones  open?  We all  want to  know.  Grace  Routes  there's a  ship  open. 
[02:30:00]  Rundown.  Bob  Murphy,  what's  in your  headphones?  Nothing  right now,  but I'm  just going  to drink  some beer  and do  some skin  poppers.  Nothing  like a  little  heroine  before  the  game.  You  know,  I remember  one time  when I  was in  the  Navy,  ball  game's  over,  we'll  see you  tomorrow  night.  We  got to  think  I'm  right.  Jay  Moore  on  fire.  Nice.  Jay 
[02:30:30]  Moore  at  Rascals  all  weekend  launch  starting  tomorrow  night.  We'll  be  back.  Anthony  Sam  Adam.  I  love  Sam  Adams.  We  drink  it all  the  time,  man.  Nothing  better  than  ice  cold  Sam  Adams.  I  don't  even  mind  them  when  they're  warm. 
[02:31:00]  You  know,  I  have  so  much  fluid  in  my  lungs,  I  just  inhale  the  Sam.  It  gets  in  my  system  faster.  My  lungs  don't  seem  to  care  about  liquid.  I  wonder  Bob  how  much  of  that  liquid  in  your  lungs  is  actually  Sam  Adams  lager.  You  know,  I  hope  it's  all  of  it.  I  just  hope  that  my  lungs  are  jam  packed  with  Sam  Adams  lager  and  summer  ale.  Mike  Piazza's  on  fire.  Literally. 
[02:31:30]  He  has  he's  flaming.  Somewhere  between  second  and  short  left  field.  I  like  Sam  Adams.  has  nothing  needs  Sam  Adams.  Summer  ale  goes  great  with  grilling  and  barbecue.  I  care  about  my  guests  and  serve  only  the  best.  Shows  them  styles.  Server  beers  is  different  from  all  the  others.  Trade  up  Sam  Adams  for  all  your  summer  parties. 
[02:32:00]  Sam  Adams.  Howard  Howard  Howard  Howard  Howard  Howard  By  Opie  and  Anthony  All  owned  by  Infinity  Broadcasting.  This  is  1027  WNEW.  Right on.  It's the Opie  and Anthony  show with  Jay Moore  playing  Rascals  all weekend  long.  Starting in  West Orange  Thursday and  Friday night.  Jim Norton  in the  studio. 
[02:32:30]  Oh yeah.  Cowbell  Bill.  Bob  Levy.  Bob  Levy in  the  studio.  First  appearance  for Bob  Levy.  Pleasure  to be  here with  you maniacs.  You guys  have fun.  Did you  guys see  I just  saw another  Toyota  commercial.  You know  how they  do stuff  with  technology  like  Forrest  Gump  when they  had him  with  President  Kennedy?  Yeah.  The  new  Toyota  commercial  is for  the  and it's  during the  race riot  for the  OJ  verdict.  Yeah.  Or  no  the  Rodney  King  verdict.  It's  the  commercial 
[02:33:00]  black  guy  yanks  Reginald  Denny  out of  the  truck  and  smashes  him  in the  face  with  a  brick  and  then  a  fire  extinguisher  and  then  punches  the  snot out  of him  and then  he gets  in a  Toyota  Tercel  and he  drives  away.  Wow.  What a  callback.  That's  the new  commercial  they got.  Nice.  Nobody's  protesting  that one.  Why  do you  get out  of  the  truck  Norton?  Using  the speed  bumps  Norton.  You  know  how hard  it  is  to  stop  one of  these  trucks?  These  things are  heavy  Norton.  I'm  going to  blow out  the brakes 
[02:33:30]  then I  got to  hear  from  Mr.  Marshall.  Oh I  had to  throw down  here with  the  race  riot.  Don't  look back  Norton.  I'm  not  stopping  that  bus.  Norton  has  no  fear  Norton.  Don't  look  in  their  eye.  Get  your  foot  out of  that  Norton.  This  train  is  going  to  Rochester. 
[02:34:00]  Squeeze  into  driving  Reginald  Benny's  truck.  I  hear  the  gang  bang  Mrs.  Manacotti.  What's  it?  Hey  how  about  this  little  party  huh?  Oh  cocktail.  There's  40  black  guys  throwing  bricks  at  look  at  this  little  routine  here  Norton.  Now  the  looting  Hong  Kong  got  yo  watch  your  string  of  puss  freaking  Norton. 
[02:34:30]  I  didn't  want to  tell  everyone  Jay's  going to  be on  with  Kelly  Ripp  tomorrow.  We had  Kelly  on the  show.  She  rocked.  She  was  really  hot.  So  that's  tomorrow  morning  at  9?  9,  right?  I'm  not  sure.  I've  got to  get there  to  4  in  the  morning.  Do you  get there  early?  No way.  Not that  early.  I was  pretty  laid  back  about  it.  I  think  that  surprised  them.  For  all you  know  they're  going to  be  awful.  You  don't  want  to  be  Jon  Stewart 
[02:35:00]  hosting  the  Grammys  and  saying  this  sucks  on  camera.  Twice.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you  have to  read all  the  bios  and  everything?  I  try  to.  But  the  interviews  are  pretty  short.  They're  like  two  minutes.  But I  think  that  might  be  because  I  rambled  so  long  in  the  beginning.  Well,  do that  again.  No one  cares.  Some of  the  cats.  I don't.  I'm thinking  of all  the times  I said  you guys'  names on  TV and  you guys  gave me  flack for  not speaking  on Letterman.  And then I  thought all 
[02:35:30]  the way  back to  my very  first  Fox  NFL  This  Morning  show  when I  was talking  about  somebody's  offensive  line.  I go,  yeah,  well,  it's  really easy  to score  touchdowns  when your  defensive line  is like  Opie and  Anthony  and their  friends.  That was  a good  one.  That was  a reach.  When you're  lining up  three in  the box,  Opie,  Anthony,  and their  friends.  Okay,  terrific.  Okay,  terrific. 
[02:36:00]  Ron,  what's going  on?  Hey,  Ron.  Hey,  how you  doing,  guys?  Nice.  Having a  lot of  fun today.  Cool.  Hey,  Jay.  Yeah?  Dude,  man,  thanks for  giving props  to little  Nicky,  man.  Ah,  see that?  Listen,  am I the  only person  in the world  that ever  saw this  friggin'  movie?  You know,  I have to  say,  I never  saw it.  I didn't  see it either.  It's funny,  man.  The reviews  were horrendous  and I bought  the myth  and just  figured it  was a  horrible  movie.  You know  what?  It's  funny.  Okay,  the only  benefit of  seeing that  movie is  if you  get it  on DVD  because  they got  a part.  Yeah, 
[02:36:30]  I'm going  to sound  like a  friggin'  animal lover  or something,  but on DVD  they got a  part when  the animals,  you know,  when the dogs  or whatever  they are,  start like  tapping each  other.  Okay,  that's about  the best part  that you've  got to say  if you could  ever see that.  The big yellow  one's a sock!  The big yellow  one's a sock!  When you're  telling these  little stories,  here's a good  idea.  Have a point.  It makes it  so much more  interesting for  the listener!  Puzzah!  You know what? 
[02:37:00]  I cannot believe  my life has  ever come down  to life  has got the  sun.  Oh,  God.  You still  can't say it.  I know.  You're all right,  man.  The big yellow  one's a sock!  Yeah,  I know.  Come on!  Okay,  well,  listen,  this is retarded  Ron signing off,  okay,  because I'm not  doing too good  here.  You got it  on handle now.  You've been  fine.  Now everyone's  going to remember  retarded Ron.  Right.  Look at you.  Next time you  call,  say it's retarded  Ron.  Next time we  do an appearance,  all of a sudden  we're going to  point you out,  look,  there he is,  retarded Ron.  You're huge now. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah,  I'm really huge.  Two shows on  Sunday for  retarded Ron  around.  Yeah,  really,  I'll be opening  for you,  I'm sure.  Hey,  if you can draw,  you can middle.  I'm going to take  Dina Cola to  Milwaukee.  Get packs to  place with a  bunch of 80-year-old  ants.  They're like,  wow,  that was a weird  crowd,  but you sure  packed them in.  We had to borrow  seats from the  bingo parlor.  Michael,  you're tremendous.  That other man  cursed a little  too much.  Okay,  well,  there goes my  props for  Little Nicky. 
[02:38:00]  Okay,  that's about it  there,  dudes.  The talking  dog,  did anybody  here see  Little Nicky?  No.  The dog  that helps  him when he's  on,  Bob Levy  said he  rented  Monkia that  day.  Try getting  on the  mic,  it's a  good career  move.  Wow.  You're on  fire today,  right?  The dog  can talk  to him,  you know,  but his  roommate's  gay,  but he's  like faking  it,  you know,  and he  goes,  well,  I got a  couch  here,  you know,  maybe you  could stay  over,  and Little 
[02:38:30]  Nicky's  like,  I don't  think that'd  be a good  idea,  and he's  like,  well,  you know,  I got a  girlfriend,  he goes,  don't you  meet boyfriend,  and the  dog just  goes,  busted.  But they're  all stolen,  and the dog's  laying on his  back,  and his  legs open,  and his  junk out.  And I  have busted.  Diane,  what's up?  Hi,  I just wanted  to say hi  to Jay,  I'm going to  see him  Saturday night  in Raspel.  That's an  Ocean Township.  That Raspel's  an Ocean Township  Saturday,  yeah,  I got to keep  the plug straight  here.  Are you going  to bring some 
[02:39:00]  hot friends?  Um,  my husband.  Does he have  any hot sisters?  No,  he's got a  not-so-hot  brother.  You got a  babysitter?  No,  I have no  kids.  Three-quarter  pants?  He has  three-quarter  pants.  Oh,  what a  homo.  No,  he doesn't.  All right,  well,  I'm glad  you're coming,  that's nice  to know.  I'm very  excited to  see you,  I think  you're  hysterical.  I got a  lot of  new jokes,  they're all  real good.  Have you  ever seen  Jay Moore?  I have  not seen  him in  person,  but does  he still  do the  dad  ball  thing?  The what? 
[02:39:30]  The dad  ball thing?  The dad  ball?  Because I  haven't even  saw soap  since then.  Oh,  I love  the soap  bit.  Soap  bit.  Yeah,  they know  all the  jokes.  No,  I know  the jokes.  Oh,  okay.  I would  say it,  but I'm  going to  ruin it  for Jay.  Oh,  he still  does it.  Oh,  I get  the standing  ovation,  I figured  I'd cut  it out  of the  X.  I could  bring up  my notebook  and do  Joe,  you know,  I could  do my  Sean  Wayans  impression  What do  you think 
[02:40:00]  of Rob  Schneider,  Jay?  I don't  know,  but when  he started  running like  that out of  the commercial,  I just  like that.  Really?  I gotta be  honest with  you.  Really?  Yeah,  I didn't  find him  to be a  very nice  man.  Yeah,  you were  on Saturday  Night Live  when he  was on it.  There were  two people  that were  like that,  him and  Ellen  Clarkhorn.  But Ellen  Clarkhorn was  like that  all the  time.  Yeah.  So the  boundaries  were set.  You didn't  even have  to say  hello when  you passed  each other  in the  hallway  because she  hated you  and you  were like,  hey,  that's cool.  Wow.  But at  least you  know.  Yeah.  So it's  fine. 
[02:40:30]  It's like,  well,  whatever,  that's her  thing.  I don't  care.  Yeah.  And then,  but Schneider  would do  it and  just be  in just  a complete  C.  Like,  like,  keep your  mouth shut,  rookie.  It's a  writer's  meeting.  What did  you write  this week?  Are you  kidding?  You know,  and I'm,  you know,  trying not to  punch the  guy out.  He would  be really  mean,  like,  for two  weeks straight  and then  one day  he'd be in  your office 
[02:41:00]  writing and  he'd come  up behind  you,  start  massaging  and be  like,  hey,  man,  how come  we never  hang,  freaking  hang out,  man?  What are you  doing?  Psychopath.  What are you  doing,  man?  You want  to write  something?  Yeah,  we blew  him off.  He wanted  to be on  our show.  Good for you.  Good for you.  But he wrote  Walk-In,  Psychic Friends  Network with me.  Oh,  really?  So I will  say that  Rob Schneider  for all  his faults  was the  one that  saw a  glimmer of  daylight in  an impression  What was  the Psychic  Friends  bit?  Psychic  Friends  Network.  I haven't  seen that  one yet.  Chris Walken?  Let's try it.  Come on. 
[02:41:30]  You're  watching  Christopher  Walken  Beyond  the Glory.  Someone  emailed  them  Beyond  the Glory  Hole.  Fantastic  idea.  You should  do a  whole  documentary  about men  running  around  with the  penises  out  sticking  them  randomly  in holes  and  wood.  You never  know.  Okay,  I just  asked to  hear it.  I didn't  expect that  you could  do it  all day.  Which  way?  Bosco  or you  bet? 
[02:42:00]  Which  way?  Freeze  out the  crowd for  the first  15 minutes  and the  first 15  seconds?  I don't  care for  that type  of humor.  You know  what,  Kim?  I haven't  lied yet.  I saved  my own  eyes.  Uh-oh.  He's  saying,  he's  saying.  I  watched  Dyson  who I  think is  hilarious  go on  at the  comedy  store  and the  first  five  minutes  he  systematically  takes the  crowd out  of the  audience.  The guy's  so funny.  Why do you  want to start  from down  there?  Edith?  Edith.  What's 
[02:42:30]  up?  Hi,  I just  wanted to  say hi.  I'm going  to be coming  down in  New York.  Are you  even going  to be in  the studios  or do  you guys  know?  This is  Edith from  California.

You're  listening  to  Syndication  Underground  in  California?  For  like  two  and  a  half  years.  Right  on.  And  you're  coming  to  New  York  finally?  Yeah,  I'm  coming  down  the  29th  to  the 
[02:43:00]  9th.  I'll  be  down  for  the  4th.  Why?  Because  I just  want to  come to  New York.  Be afraid  of New  York.  Now that  you listen  to the  show and  you know  all the  games and  Tom  Foolery,  are you  going to  take part?  Of  course.  That's  right,  baby.  You  want to  do the  Motley  Crew  Challenge?  We  still  haven't  done  the  Motley  Crew  Challenge.  Edith,  hold on  a sec.  Are you  going to  be

We  have  to  give  credit  to  the  Motley  Crew  Challenge.  Listen to  this one,  Jay.  This is  something  that  Motley  Crew  actually  told  us.  We  had  Vince  and  Nicky  You  know  what?  They  were  so  cool.  They  were  so  cool.  They  were  really  cool.  They  had  sex  boys  over  the 
[02:44:00]  years  that  are  just  amazing.  Just  drug  induced  orgies.  So  their  one  little  game  they  used  to  play  they  would  get  a  big  double  dong  and  put  a  hundred  dollar  bill  in the  middle.  Get  two  girls.  Whoever  reaches  the  hundred  first  wins  the  hundred.  Back to  back.  You  know what  I

Rick  keeps 
[02:45:00]  the  link  out.  Jay  claims  that  Rick  has  a  peeler.  Where  were we  the  Nick  game  or  something?  He  goes  shut  up!  Shut  up!  I  didn't  know  but  I  guess  now  I  know.  It's  taking  a  long  time  getting  stuff  together.  Unsheath  it.  Edith.  Yeah.  So  we'll  see  when  you  get  here.  Yeah.  Well  I  mean  how  are  we  going  to  play  some  games

I think  she just  had surgery  done,  that's the  way it  sounds.  What?  Up and  down again.  Up and  down again.  Okay.  Yeah.  Doesn't  sound like  Norm  Abrams  sanding a  shaker  desk on  the new  Yankee  workshop.  Wow.  I like  that.  My  man.  It's  like  rough.  It  just  went  over a  pothole.  All  right,  I'm  gravy

A  public  green at  a  golf  course  in  South  Jersey,  it 
[02:53:00]  sounds  like.  It's  got that  sound,  but it's  very  deceiving.  Edith?  Yeah.  What  is in  your  pants?  Velcro.  Stack  or two.  Edith?  Well,  it's not  Jim  Morton.  It's  Hitler  mustache.  You're a  little  bitch.  You're a  lying  little  bitch.  At least I  was close.  I guess  that there  was hair  somewhere.  I'm not  a lying  bitch.  I know  you lie.  Rub it  again.  My  record's  intact.  I  think  your  legs  come  away.  Rub it  with your  hand with 
[02:53:30]  the phone  next to  it.  I'm  keeping  track.  Six for  six in  this game.  What do you  want me to do?  Put the  phone there  and rub it  with your  hand.  Okay.  Or a  cucumber.  Put duct  tape on it  and yank.  We'll see  how loud  you scream.  Well,  I can wax  it when we  come in.  Well,  we can do  that.  Can we  touch it?  You can  never mind.  Edith,  can we  point to  it and  go,  Edith.  Yes.  We're going  to let  you go,  but we're  going to  see you  when you  come into  New York,  all right? 
[02:54:00]  Definitely.  There's  Edith from  the West  Coast.  Thank you,  Edith.  You're  welcome.  You're  right.  Bye.  Bye.  You're  a girl.  This is  legal,  isn't it?  You're  a  filthy  whore. 
[02:54:30]  All right,  we've got  to take a  quick break  and we'll  play What  Do We  Learned  Next,  right?  Yeah.  Don't  forget,  Jay  Maury  Rascals  all this  weekend,  starting  tomorrow  night.  Nice.  Boobs,  the world's  universal  language.  I use  my  breath to  get other  people's  attention.

He was being  mean to me,  like the  other story  I told.  Michael  McCain was  the guy  that was  like,  when do you  come in  the office,  relax,  when do we  have to  chill out?  We'll  say,  we had him  on the  show a  couple  times.  He's  a good  guy.  Hanging  out with  a classic.  Nice.  He's a  New Jersey  and Connecticut.

I learned  that when  Stinky isn't  funny,  it's time for  him to answer  the phone.  I learned  women go to  work squashing  full.  I learned  Jay is  playing  rascal  somewhere  this weekend.  If a joke  doesn't work,  wish cancer  on the  audience.  That's what  Jerry learned  from  Medicine,  New Jersey.  And Saturday  is three-quarter  pants night  of rascals.  I learned  that  Vanilla is  spelt 
[02:57:30]  vanilla,  but pronounced  Vanilla.  People picked  up on  everything.  Don't forget  Rico  Brogna.  Dylan,  what's up?  I learned  three things.  One,  black girl  doesn't like  to be called  Shrek.  Dylan!  Jay Moore  has a black  godson,  and Harry  Carey likes  vaginas.  Dylan!  There you go.  Thank you.  Later.  There goes Dylan.

No,  but wherever  you end up,  I hope I  can still  listen to  you.  I'd like  to see you  without  your top.  I'll listen  to you without  my top.  I don't care.  All right,  Laura,  thank you.  You'll have  to have  lower rays,  though.  All right,  thank you. 
[02:58:30]  You can do  a great  Sam Adams  promo without  anal sex if  you use  dead or  half-dead  baseball  announcers.  And I  learned what  Harry Carey  and Bob  Murphy sound  like on  Crystal  Man.  Without a  doubt.  One of the  funniest  things I've  heard in a  long time.  All right,  Joe.  Al Mack from  McCliff,  today I  learned that  Opie and  Anthony are  the batting  cage.  That's a  good one,  right?  I learned  Opie did 
[02:59:00]  make it  after all.  Carolyn.  Hey,  today I  learned that  Anthony  plugged Jim  Norton's  junk.  Nice.  Wow,  you were  paying  attention  today.  You're  listening.  Thank you.  The ex-guy  from Jersey,  today I  learned that  Norton wants  to spray his  audiences with  a host full  of AIDS.  Let's go  to Dennis.  God,  there's tons  of them  today.  Dennis,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  I learned  two things.  One,  Harry Carey  and Bob  Murphy engaged  in a  choking  poke,  and Opie's 
[02:59:30]  ass is  now taking  reservations.  Very good.  Thanks.  I went to  an Indian  reservation  once with  my wife,  Helene,  and they had  teepees and  everything Indian  you could  imagine.  There's a fan  on the field  on the field  being  pummeled  by Ricky  Goody  and  you know,  the teepee  has a hole  in the top  so the smoke  can escape.  Bob,  I know you  like to  smoke  palm  off,  so you'd  be welcome 
[03:00:00]  in my  teepee.  He's unconscious.  You'd be  welcome in  my teepee  anytime.  I'm not a big  fan of the  Indians.  There goes  General Custer  walking away  from the  battle.  Oh,  wait,  no,  he's dead.  Sorry,  he's dead.  What's he?  What's up?  Hey,  what's going  on guys?  I learned  two things  today.  I learned  that when  Kelly Ripper  says come  in the other  word better  follow it.  Yes.  And I feel  like to  say the  word S.  Very good.  Take it easy  guys.  Make sure  you watch  Kelly and  Jay tomorrow  on that  region show.  My favorite  S.  word is  sarsaparilla. 
[03:00:30]  And you  don't get  a good  sarsaparilla  too much  these days  except for  when we  go south  like places  like Atlanta  and Philadelphia.  South  Philly.  Allen Iverson  plays in  Philadelphia  and they  have a  Liberty Bell.  Bob.  Steve,  what's up?  What's up,  guys?  Good show.  Yeah,  we had fun.  I learned  that contract  negotiations  give Opie  potty mouth.  Yeah.  And I also 
[03:01:00]  learned that  Jay Moore  has already  kissed  Kelly Ripper's  baby.  Well,  she has,  this is her  second child  so that's  not even  dirty.  Yeah,  let's go to  Mark.  Mark,  what'd you learn?  I learned  that footballs  don't always  mean you get  a walk.  Sometimes you  get a pass.  You know what  I mean?  Let's go to  Morgan.  Morgan.  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  All right,  first off,  Opie's PBA card  can save his  job.  Coming soon,  Superman 5,  Superman vs.  Radiation Man.  That would be 
[03:01:30]  fantastic.  Oh,  yeah.  Radiation has a  valuable tune.  Kathy Lee and  Yeager don't  mix.  All right,  that's it,  guys.  Have a good  one.  Thanks,  Morgan.  Thanks for  calling.  I'm back  from the club.  Today I learned  that when NASCAR  goes to remote  control cars,  the drivers  will still wear  helmets in the  room just in  case.  Thank you.  You know  that Dale  Earnhardt  sure caught  a bad  break when  he smashed  into that  wall?  A lot of  fuck was  made about  a seatbelt.  What I want  to know is, 
[03:02:00]  hey,  what's  the hurry?  You were  in second  place.  Why don't  you slow  down a little  bit?  You know  you're not  going to  win.  You might  be alive.  Hit by  the pitch  and  on.  Wow.  Kate.  Hey,  hey,  guys.  I learned  today that  only Anthony  can make  Winnie the  Pooh sound  hot.  Wow.  Let's hear  something.  Yeah.  I'd like  to stick it  in your  honeypot.  Oh,  don't get  me started  again,  Anthony.  Again?  Wow,

Do you  know what  the comedy  seller is?  Brian,  what's going  on?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  You know  what I am  today?  I learned  to wear a  raincoat  to a  Norton  shelf.  Right.  The new  Gallagher.  Take care,  guys.  You know,  going back  to radiation  and Superman, 
[03:03:00]  I think  Superman  would win.  He's  Superman.  Radiation  is a  thing  without  a  conscience  or any  concept  of  good  versus  evil  in the  history  of the  old  comic book  genre.  If you  could beat  everything,  I once  saw  Super  Strike 3,  I once  saw  Superman  turn back  a tsunami  with his  bare hands  and breath. 
[03:03:30]  I'm ready  to cough  up a tsunami.  Well,  go ahead,  because there's  a hole  in the  top  of my  taping.  What's  Christopher  Reeve  today?  Nicely.  Very good.  He's like  Superman.  Is he on  the PGA  Tour now,  Christopher  Reeve?  No,  he jumped  down the  window and  died.  That's  a golf cart.  I'm trying  to hear  it about.  They should  bring him  down to  South Carolina  and let  Suzanne  Smith  throw him  in a  lake.  I'm  playing at  Hitler's  bar mitzvah 
[03:04:00]  Sunday night.  Andrew.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  I watched  Meta Man  and Hitler.  Today I learned  that Rick  has a  dealer.  Yes,  you did  learn that.  All right.  Not many  people know  Hitler only  had one  ball on  him.  I knew  that.  We were  in double  earth  equipment  together  way back  when I  was announcing  for the  Cardinals.  Got fired  because I  stuck my  pen in  company and  slept with  the owner's  daughter. 
[03:04:30]  But you  know,  when you  put on  that  uniform  of the  red  birds,  there's  something  primal  that comes  over you.  Cubbies  are harmless.  But when  you're a  cardinal  strutting  your stuff  in the  press box  and you're  not  150 years  old and  you actually  get erections,  you feel  proud to put  on the  red  birds.  I get  the same  feeling  looking at  National  Geographic.  nothing  better than  a  That's  not Murphy  sitting to  my left. 
[03:05:00]  Nothing  better than  a  Negro  woman with  big long  breasts and  a neck like  a giraffe.  I like when  their nipples  look like  swing sets.  I would  put a  swing set  on the  roof of my  car coming  back from  Sears.  The kid  wanted one,  you know,  and,  oh,  I think  blew right  off and  I got  pulled over  drunk as  a skunk.  But fortunately,  the police  officer was, 
[03:05:30]  what do you  know,  hey,  he was a  Cub fan.  He let me  go and  helped me  put the  swing set  back together.  Did you  know when  you have a  swing set  hit by the  pitch and  Scyther again,  second time  in the  ball game,  he's been  hit in the  face.  When you  put a  swing set  in the  ground,  Bob,  you have  to cement  it.  Otherwise,  your children  will fly  right off  the earth.  Cement the  sling set  or it  makes a  ker-clump  sound. 
[03:06:00]  I make  the ker-clump  sound when  I breathe.  My entire  ramble cut  in half  by one  cent of  trillion.  You're  killing me,  man.  We got  killing me.  I love  being here.  I'm so  happy I  came up  today on  one hour  sleep.  Some guy  from Staten  Island.  Today I  learned that  a pissed  off Opie  and a  hungover  Anthony  plus  Jay  Moore,  Jim  Norton  and  Wild  Bill  Hillcock  makes great  radio.  And Bob  Levy and La 
[03:06:30]  Machine and the  rest of the game.  Jay Moore  and  Raskol's in the  game.  Jay Moore  is in the  game.  He  doesn't need to  lose anymore.  He doesn't need to  lose anymore.  His thighs look like  ball bags.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  You look great.  I'm getting a call.  We've got to get out of here.  I want to thank  Jay Moore for coming  by.  Nice. 
[03:07:00]  And Norton and the  rest of the game.  Jay Moore at Raskol's in  West Orange Thursday and  Friday and then it gets  confusing after that.  But he is playing  Raskol's somewhere  between Thursday and  Sunday.  And the great ocean  township.  If you go to Raskol's  during the day, you'll  see the sun.  You know, I once went  to the sun on a  school trip.  It was very warm.  My mother made me wear  linen suits and we  all know how wrinkly  they get in that heat. 
[03:07:30]  And there's no humidity  on the sun whatsoever.  A helicopter just  crashed right into  Mark Grace,  decapitating him.  Oh, I'll  this morrow.  The sun is a ball  of gas.  You can't stand on  the sun.  I tried.  Luckily, I was  wearing sunscreen.  There's Grace's head.  They're going to put it  in the bowling bag and  I guess give it to some  lucky fan.  Here comes the music.
