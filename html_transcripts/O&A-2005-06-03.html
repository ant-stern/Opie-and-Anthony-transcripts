<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically irreverent banter, liberally spiced with expletives and self-deprecating humor.  They introduced a lineup of studio guests: the Bag Oâ€™ Nuts comedy team (who brought a "comedy porn DVD" titled *Reality Sucks*), partially clothed showgirls, and a hypnotist named Salish.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to listener-submitted remixes of audio of comedian Bob Kelly breaking his knee, ranging from awful to mildly amusing, with one particularly inappropriate remix combining the injury with "Dust in the Wind."  The hosts expressed skepticism about hypnotism, punctuated by crude jokes, and criticized Sirius Radio's large car units, leading to the banning of a persistent complainer.  They also discussed Howard Stern's perceived influence on reality TV, a caller's complaint about a large Sirius radio unit obstructing their view, an update on a midget family, news about Gene Wilder and Michael Jackson, an autographed photo of "The Mad Mexican," and an MTV show featuring 80s bands, commenting on their current status.  The show played both the original and a recent live performance of Loverboy's "Working for the Weekend," before the scheduled hypnotist performance was cut short.

The discussion then shifted to the passage of time and its impact on musical artists, specifically Loverboy and Flock of Seagulls, with the hosts playing recordings of their 80s hits and more recent performances to highlight the decline in quality.  They criticized the over-reliance on obscure 80s deep cuts on music channels, and the conversation branched out to include listener calls discussing various artists and radio stations.  Callers shared anecdotes, including one claiming to have invented Loverboy and another blaming Nirvana for their lack of a successful comeback.  Tiffany's career and a Playboy appearance were also discussed.  The segment transitioned to "The Most Dangerous Catch," leading to a rambling discussion about Gordon Lightfoot's "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" and its excessive length.

The show later featured the return of in-studio guests Ralphie May and Joey Diaz, with an extended, sexually explicit discussion about their lives and experiences, including their roles in "The Longest Yard."  This segment was punctuated by numerous vulgar comments and listener calls, along with a brief appearance by the hypnotist and the strippers.  The comedians also discussed writing for pornographic films, describing the process as surprisingly easy and recounting anecdotes from pornographic film sets, including graphic descriptions of sexual acts and interactions with actresses.  This segment included Brittany, Mallory, Lauren, and the hypnotist Salish.  A contentious exchange with another radio show, "Out to Lunch," involved significant vulgar insults.  The comedians' personal views on strippers were also discussed.  Clips of Boston Mayor Menino, highlighting his speech impediments, were played.

The next segment began with the hosts riffing on a magician's assistant selection process and childhood attention-seeking behavior.  Callers shared stories, including one about a Vegas hypnotism experience and another about a woman disrobing during a hypnotism class.  This led to an extended humorous segment about "mole people" living in NYC subway tunnels, interspersed with clips of Mayor Menino's speeches.  The hypnotist Salish (from Fiji) attempted to hypnotize two female volunteers, unsuccessfully, leading to involuntary swearing and much laughter.  A news story about a man driving for miles after decapitating his friend was briefly mentioned.  The studio guests included Salish and two female volunteers, in addition to the usual O&A crew.

The final segment detailed the show's disastrous on-air experience.  The hypnotist failed, the strippers refused to disrobe despite encouragement, leading to listener calls commenting on the show's failures.  The hosts expressed frustration and disappointment using profanity, and joked about the poor performance, using metaphors like "nosedive" and "big tit" graph.  The hosts' attempts to end the broadcast prematurely involved ushering off several guests, including the strippers.  Ralphie May, Joey Diaz, and unnamed strippers were mentioned, along with Bob Kelly and the Bag O' Nuts sponsor.  A discussion about someone dropping what was implied to be cocaine in the toilet occurred.  The segment focused on the hosts' displeasure with the various segments and guests' failures.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  And yeah, we're back.  Where have you been?  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it goes!  Here it goes!  The Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.

We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  All the radio rips me off.  Shut up, you damn asshole. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up, you damn asshole.  ONA Party Rock!  ONA Party Rock!  Just do it!  Hello, exactly!  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I'm gonna kiss you on the mouth.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McFriend.  Do you wanna kiss me, or...?  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Hello, exactly! 
[00:05:00]  Okay!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Get her!  Oh!  Are you ready? Are you ready?  Eh, eh, eh.  Wow!  Wow! Wow! Wow!  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:05:30]  Uh-huh.  What do you think, Anthony?  I don't know. Let me see.  Oh, boy.  You're booming.  Oh, no, no, no.  I kind of dig it.  I'm gonna just turn you down a little bit.  Are you sure?  Just slightly.  Let me see.  Yeah.  Let me see.  I like.  Oh, this could work. Wait a minute.  I like it, Anthony. I like it.  I think it might actually be there.  All right.  I kind of like it.  I'm on my mic and it's working.  Thank you.  I think they got it figured out, the microphone. 
[00:06:00]  I think they did.  Anthony's microphone.  And, uh, here we go.  Another Opie and Anthony show about to begin.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Who brought breakfast?  I don't know.  You brought breakfast?  Thank you.  Who are those guys?  Food courtesy of Bag O' Nuts comedy team.  www.bag, with two G's, O'Nuts.com.  They have a comedy porn DVD called Reality Sucks, which is out now.  Comedy porn DVD? 
[00:06:30]  Uh-oh.  Let me see.  Girls, courtesy of Showgirls.  What?  Are there girls here?  Yeah.  Right now?  Are they naked yet?  Uh, not yet.  I saw one walking around in, uh, jeans and a little, uh, what is that?  Half T-shirt.  What the hell is she waiting for?  Ooh, the other girl.  And then we have a hypnotist coming in?  Mm-hmm.  Ugh.  Who's the wacky guy?  There are wacky guys in this porno.  Yeah, they're here, too.  They're here, the wacky guy?  Uh-huh.  And this wacky guy?  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  What do you mean, wacky guy?  I'm saying porno and wackiness.  Let me see.  We've discussed that, uh, you shouldn't have too much wackiness in your porn.  Well, Jimmy actually likes comedy and, uh, porn together.  I've seen it in your act.  You're talking about how great that is.  No.  Look at him.  Look at him.  No.  What are you saying?  If you're serious, I'm like, I must have just sold my whole book process out for a joke.  I really have my own work.  Of course not.  Um, I'm looking at...  You're sarcastic, sir.  I don't know how I like him pouring his tears.  I'm looking at the DVD cover, Pornywood, and it's, uh, the girls are awesome. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And then you've got the wacky dude.  Then there's wacky guy.  In a bow tie.  Has like a Rupert Pupkin look to one of them.  Yeah, exactly.  With shades on.  Yeah.  I will, uh, we'll, uh, give these guys about 30 seconds.  No problem.  Composite.  They brought, uh, they brought food.  Yeah.  As I eat my regular sandwich.  We got food, naked girls, comedy, and a hypnotist today. 
[00:08:00]  What?  A hypnotist?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?  You know, I'm very skeptical with the hypnotists.  I don't, uh, I don't buy into the whole hypnotism thing.  Yeah, Anthony's always been kind of, uh, against the hypnotist guys.  I think it's just, uh, it's a show, you know?  When they, these hypnotists, they go out and, you see them at like comedy clubs and stuff.  They have, uh, hypnotists and they get the people from the crowd and they make them act  all funny and do weird things.  That's all, like, fake. 
[00:08:30]  It's all fake.  The people get up there and they, they're acting for their friends.  It's, you know, it's their, their time to, to get their little 15 minutes of fame in  front of a crowd.  But it doesn't really work, the hypnotism.  You can't make somebody, you're a bird.  Okay.  You are, um, you're, you're a very outgoing person, uh, but now you're a complete slut.  You go around and, uh, and show the guys here.  That's the road I want to go down.  Yeah.  If you want to prove that hypnotists are, are real, you get, uh, a show together, you 
[00:09:00]  get some really tough, you know, hetero guys.  Yeah.  And you make them suck dick on the stage.  Yeah.  That's a show.  Yeah, we'll see if they're...  Can I buy our advance tickets on the stage?  And we'll see if they're, they're just, uh, acting for their friends, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know?  Because most people say they don't remember what they did under hypnosis, right?  You know, I was a skeptic, but when I woke up out of it and I had jism coming out of  my mouth.  Right.  You know, I got to say, I believe them now. 
[00:09:30]  I believe them now because I have no...  Because I'm not gay.  Right.  But, you know, I was taking a fat one in the ass and, you know...  Then I'll believe...  I'm not gay.  ...that this thing is, uh, the real deal.  What about, though, when they hypnotize people for information, like license plates and all  that stuff?  I mean, they can get you to kind of go back and see things that you can't see or remember  things you can't remember.  I think there's...  I don't think that's hypnotism like everybody thinks of it.  I think if, if, you know, you saw a license plate and you can't quite remember and they  put you under, maybe they're tapping into that part of your memory and, and relaxing 
[00:10:00]  you in ways where you could access the information easier.  Or things like that I believe in, sure.  But not, you know, okay, you're a chicken.  Or you're, you know, I don't buy it.  Did you get more jism in your eye?  No.  No, that eye is red.  Yeah, your eye's all messed up.  Is it really?  Yeah, but it's just that side of that eye.  I'm a mess.  Okay.  No, are you okay, Jimmy?  Yeah, I think so.  Oh my God, you all right? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I guess.  I guess.  Are you tired?  A little bit.  My schedule's been messed up all week.  I'll be all right.  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy's a little tired.  I thought he had a little jism in his eye.  No, no, no.  You look a little beat up today.  I feel tired, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Hang on, we'll get you through it today.  That's what friends are for.  Right.  One guy's, you know, just kind of stumbling around.  The other guy's, uh, help him out.  That's right.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, boys?  Hey.  Hello. 
[00:11:00]  I was just checking Howard out on my drive-in this morning, and one of his sicker fans called  in and said that, uh, the show that Ashton Kutcher was doing, the Freaks and Geeks or whatever,  is a rip-off of Howard because Howard fixed up, like, his idiots there with, like, hot chicks.  And then Howard, as a matter of fact, says that all of reality TV has something to do  with his show.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  It's out there, you know.  Unbelievable.  All of reality television. 
[00:11:30]  All of it.  And then before that, the guy was saying that, well, he's a big paper, and he, you know,  will be able to tape the show and how it gets the satellite.  I mean, really, the technology is amazing.  They're going to have, like, a TVO on it.  I mean, they're going to have a Wi-Fi for crying out loud.  Oh, right, right.  Like, they're going to have some kind of way you can record a show.  Yeah, we already have it.  It's called a Wi-Fi.  Yeah.  Right.  The technology is just amazing over there, though.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Anyway, boys, have a good one.  All right.  We were driving, when we were driving in D.C., we saw a car next to us, and my girlfriend 
[00:12:00]  looks down into the car, and there's a serious unit.  It's stuck to the windshield.  It's like a windshield-mounted thing.  And it was so big, we were laughing so hard at it, because it was just, it was giant.  And it was taking up so much of the windshield that it was a hazard.  It was an absolute hazard to the people that were driving around this car. 
[00:12:30]  And we could not stop looking or laughing at it.  Like, I had to drive next to the person to see how they could possibly drive with this  huge piece of hardware right in their vision.  Amazing, the people over there at Sirius actually crowing about this equipment.  That is just archaic and huge.  It probably also doubles as a windshield defroster in the winter, with the heat coming off the 
[00:13:00]  tubes in there.  It just keeps the windshield clean, so maybe they do have a plus.  Oh, that's classic.  Very nice.  All reality television.  God, what a pompous asshole.  Is anybody buying this stuff anymore?  Or is anybody listening and going, yeah, because I got to admit, back in the 80s, I was caught  up in the whole thing.  I would listen and be like, wow, I guess he has a point there. 
[00:13:30]  But, you know, you go through some kind of deprogramming.  You have to actually be deprogrammed and see the truth.  And then when you listen now with an open mind and go, oh my God, he's claiming, he's staking  a claim to all reality television, that he invented it.  Tell him, Fred.  You tell him, Fred.  Unbelievable.  Oh, that's right, Howard.  Whatever you say.  You did invent everything. 
[00:14:00]  That's right.  Oh, I can't disagree with you or you'll get me fired, too.  Yeah.  All right.  I think we should play some Bob Kelly remixes right away.  I mean, right away.  What do you think?  I'm looking at a total of...  Yeah, how many were sent in?  I'm looking at a total of 30 Bob Kelly remixes.  30.  Our pal Bob Kelly broke his knee playing football with Dane Cook and the gang as part of Torgasm. 
[00:14:30]  And they were rolling video for a DVD that's going to come out eventually.  And we got the audio of him breaking his leg.  It's great.  It's absolutely great audio.  And if you're a new listener to the show or you didn't get to listen too much this week,  over the weekend, we play all the shows of the week, back to back to back to back to back.  Yes.  All right.  So you can catch up on some of the things we did this week.  But basically, we took the Bob Kelly audio and we gave it to the listeners.  We love to do this from time to time. 
[00:15:00]  And the listeners come up with remixes.  There are some really, really awful ones.  And not even awful like, wow, listen to this.  It's so awful that it's funny.  Just bad.  That make no sense.  Well, we got 30 of them, Anthony.  30.  We got 30 in, and we'll probably play no more than 10 of them.  Yep.  And we played a few yesterday already.  An example of awful is whoever put, like, dust in the wind and then played the Bob Kelly. 
[00:15:30]  Like, I don't get it.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, don't change the channel.  We're showing you an example of one that just, A, we don't get.  B, just stinks.  Because people say, play the bad ones.  Like, I want to hear it.  No, it's not even bad in that way.  This makes no sense.  I don't know what kind of drugs the guy was on that put this together.  We'll just listen for a few seconds here. 
[00:16:00]  Jim!  You're way down.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I snapped my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Okay.  Why would you put that together?  I was going to say, someone explain that. 
[00:16:30]  Please explain it to me.  Maybe if I closed my eyes and I broke my knee, like, they thought that there's two things  that body parts are doing.  That's the only thing.  That's the only possible.  And that's so out there.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  Can I look at it?  I broke my knee, man.  Oh, shit.  Dust in the wind.  I broke my knee.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Who did that one?  That was a Jilly Donut from Whackbag.com. 
[00:17:00]  Worst one ever.  Ever?  Worst remix ever.  Well, in this group.  That's the worst one because it doesn't even try to make sense.  Like, at least the guy with the...  With that music, at least you could picture that he's got the wacky Benny Hill music.  This is also bad.  But at least it's kind of wacky.  Like if something tragic is happening to wacky music. 
[00:17:30]  I get what he was trying to do, but it's just not funny.  As opposed to dust in the wind, which just makes no sense whatsoever.  Yeah.  See, so these are the ones we've had to weed through to come up with some of the good ones.  Well, they want to hear some of the bad ones, so this one almost made it.  Ah, fuck!  I broke my knee, man. 
[00:18:00]  By P-niggity.  I slapped my knee, man.  Ah, fuck!  I broke my knee, man.  This is just a remix.  Right.  They're kind of...  Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!  Ah!  Alright, well...  I mean...  You know.  I know Drew Boogie, and you're no Drew Boogie, sir.  This one almost made it.  By Glenn, who's a new listener. 
[00:18:30]  Fuck you!  Fuck face!  It's 1121!  You're insane.  You tell me 11 o'clock, you fucking cunt!  Don't waste my fucking time again!  You don't even give a shit!  Wait a minute, I just realized this isn't even a Bob Kelly remix, and we were listening  to this one like it was a Bob Kelly remix.  It's just me and the crazy father getting together.  Crazy dad that was left waiting by his son, and Opie from the famous, the infamous Opie  Jim Norton argument.  Right.  Alright. 
[00:19:00]  Then there was a Napoleon Dynamite that missed.  The Pulp Fiction one almost made it.  You want to listen to the Pulp Fiction one?  Didn't Steve highlight these as the good ones, though?  Yeah, one that we all liked a lot was the one that Steve highlighted as fucking terrible.  I just got a serious unit.  Oh, that's the thing you're talking about?  No, dude.  It was bigger than this, I swear.  It was more horizontal than this one is vertical.  Okay.  And it just took up the whole windshield. 
[00:19:30]  And Faggot Hawk from OpieAnthony.net is all pissed off.  Sirius Radio's large piece of equipment.  We get it.  Get off the size of fucking Sirius units already.  Why?  They're big, and it's funny.  They're big, and they try to make it sound like they're new modern equipment, and it's  funny.  You ass shit.  You know what?  You're getting banned.  There you go.  I'm banning you.  We really have to start fighting back.  There you go.  We gave the listeners too much responsibility on this show. 
[00:20:00]  Every day they bitch about something.  Bitch, bitch, bitch.  They just find the one little thing that they don't like, and they bitch about it, and blow  it out of proportion.  We got to start fighting back.  We got to take the responsibility out of the listeners' hands again.  I ban you.  I think we have to go back to the listeners just listening.  Yeah.  I ban you.  They just have to sit there and listen.  Stop.  Stop.  Don't use the instant feedback anymore.  That's it.  Don't post on message boards.  We gave you guys too much credit. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Too much fucking credit.  Every day I'm reading about one tiny thing someone doesn't like, and they blow it out  of proportion.  A little thing out of the entire show that we do with minimal breaks, four hours, every  day.  Sorry.  And it's just like, me, me, me, me.  Sorry.  But when Jimmy goes off from time to time on how big the serious units are, it makes  me laugh really hard.  Yeah.  It's just one of those things that we've in and out of the program on a weekly basis,  I should say.  This guy knows what happened. 
[00:21:00]  What are you doing?  He's looking at me eating my banana.  Jimmy starts filleting the banana.  I have to.  Keith, what's going on?  Morning, boys.  Good morning, my little liquor stick.  Hi.  Hey, I figured out the dust in the wind, Bob Kelly thing.  Oh, please tell us.  I hope you guys are sitting, including you, Jimmy.  I am.  Kansas begins with a K, and so does your knee.  And Kelly.  That's right.  Very good. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  You're on to something.  I'm killing yourself for this call.  I am.  I'll tell you what.  There's this bliminal, some sort of hidden message.  Richard is going to try to help us out.  Richard, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  I'm in the movie Old School, when Blue died.  Yeah.  And they sing Dustin O'Leary at the funeral.  Yeah, okay.  That's probably what it's for.  That's the angle you think you took?  That's what I think he's doing with it.  I can't see any other reason.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Let's go to John Q.  John Q, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[00:22:00]  So I had one of these serious units right before you guys signed for XM.  I was one of the douchebags on Wackbag.  It took the speculation a long way.  I went to Best Buy.  Those fucking assholes mounted the fucking thing right next to my GM double din receiver.  The thing was so freaking huge, I couldn't use the program set three or six or freaking  access the CD player.  That's how big the damn thing was.  I literally had to snap the bracket off to get to the right side of the fucking double 
[00:22:30]  dim GM radio.  You know, Anthony, if you have one, you know how big the fucking thing is.  I mean, it's just absolutely ridiculous on those serious units.  The thing would generate more heat than my fucking heater in the car.  So I was just like, what the fuck?  And then as soon as you guys signed, I went back to the douchebags, windled and swindled  them, and returned the fucking thing.  It was just disgusting.  Yo, here's something I had to do.  When we were going back and forth between Sirius and XM, we were having our meetings,  Sirius hooked us up with units for the car. 
[00:23:00]  For the car.  I was about to tell you the one I got.  But go ahead.  So I get the Sirius unit, and the guy comes to install it, and it's giant.  It's this big thing that has to slide into this bracket that gets screwed into your vehicle.  So now I got my Mountaineer.  That's what I had at the, no, the Pathfinder at the time.  And it's a new vehicle.  And this motherfucker, I come out, and he's drill screwing a bracket into my console of 
[00:23:30]  a brand new vehicle.  I'm like, what the, what, what, is this the only way to do this?  Right then.  And then he slides this big, hot unit.  It used to generate, like the guy said, so much heat.  That you couldn't take it out and hold it in your hand.  It was that hot.  And it was huge.  And drill screwing into the console.  I got a metal plate as big as a CD and a CD case. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  That they mounted on my dashboard.  Is that what you had the hat over?  Yeah, I have to hide it.  Because I'm so embarrassed by it.  And now I have...  What was it, like Lincoln's top hat?  It's like a hat that big?  It's gone now, and now my dashboard is a complete mess.  It's because they had to kind of, they had to glue this metal, metal thing on the dashboard.  And then the thing went up another two inches before the unit.  Yeah.  And it looks like, I don't know, an oversized, like, CB radio or something. 
[00:24:30]  And then they went to put one in, we had a Jeep, too.  A Wrangler.  Jeep Wrangler.  And there's really no dashboard on one of those things.  It's just kind of flat instrument panel.  The guy could not figure out where to put this thing, because it was so...  It was too big.  You couldn't put it anywhere.  So he wound up putting it on what amounts to the dashboard, which is like a little piece  of real estate by the windshield.  And it would hit the windshield.  It fell off, because he couldn't even get in there to screw this big bracket down. 
[00:25:00]  So he put some double-sided tape on to hold it.  But the unit's so heavy that whenever you made a turn, the thing would almost fly out the  passenger side window.  So, yeah, they're big.  And we're going to talk about how big they are all day long now.  That's right.  All right, Anthony, why don't we play some of the remixes that kind of made us chuckle  here?  Yeah, some of the good ones.  Some of the better ones.  Bob Kelly and Homer Simpson.  This is the one out of 30 that came in that Steve labeled fucking terrible. 
[00:25:30]  It's from Todd from Framingham in Massachusetts.  But it made all three of us laugh.  Made us chuckle.  Hey, you freaks!  Joe!  I snapped my knee, man!  What?  I broke my knee, man!  What?  I broke my knee, man!  What the deal?  I broke my fucking knee, dude!  Oh, okay.  Hold my hand, man.  You are gay.  Ah, it's fucked up.  Hold my hand, man.  I'm not gay, but I'll learn. 
[00:26:00]  I'm not gay, but I'll learn.  All right?  Not bad.  And what I like about it, it's, yeah, exactly.  It's quick and to the point.  You know, some of the remixes that came in were like three minutes long, three and a half  minutes long.  Why did dumb Steve hate that one and think that the Kansas one was this brilliant remix?  No, he hated the Kansas one, too.  I didn't like either one of them.  All right.  Shit head.  This one made us laugh pretty hard as well.  Kind of a take off on the Terry Shivo one that came in a while ago.  Steve, you didn't like the Homer one? 
[00:26:30]  Why am I a shit head?  Like the one, shit head.  Wow, what is up with these hits?  Oh, God.  Steve, when are you going to punch someone around here?  I can't, dude.  Just punch somebody.  It's not that I wouldn't like to.  I just, I've hit people before and I've seen what has happened and I didn't like what  happened.  I didn't like the initial.  Wow, that's pretty.  Yeah.  I hit somebody when I was working in clubs.  I clobbered somebody really hard and the guy went to the hospital and I just,  did not like the after effects of, what happened? 
[00:27:00]  Lawsuit?  Potential, yeah.  I didn't like the whole, the guy's thinking about pressing charges.  He wants you arrested.  I'm like, oh, shit.  And it was just, it's that one impulsive thing.  You clobber someone hard and it's, so, restraint.  You didn't like these remixes, huh?  You know, it's like, as I was telling Anthony before, after listening to or absorbing all  of this diarrhea, you're just, you know, you're hoping for a nice well-formed log with  maybe some peanuts in it.  Good example to come along.  Good example because they are all shit, but you're hoping for a good one. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, it really is.  And honestly, I did not like that Homer Simpson one.  I didn't, I don't think it flowed well.  When I'm listening to these things, I'm listening for some kind of context or conversation.  He's listening for production value, too.  Yeah, that's true, that's true.  The DVD was off on that one, and it's out of phase, and what?  Well, it's hard because, you know, no one's really hitting the bullseye on these.  It's just you're trying to, you're trying to gauge them by awful and less awful.  Well, some of them are just making us laugh, though. 
[00:28:00]  I'm sure.  Just giving us chuckles, like this one from Harry T.  Check this out, it's short.  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  I broke it, dude.  I felt a crack.  Fuck.  I broke my leg.  I broke it.  Oh, my hand, man. 
[00:28:30]  I got to scream some.  We liked that one.  I still don't know how Steve didn't like, how did you not like the Homer Simpson one,  but you think the Patsy Cline one is like a Turner Classic Networks remix?  Did I highlight the Patsy Cline one?  No, I didn't.  I did not, thank you very much.  Ryan Regan and Bob Kelly?  That wasn't that bad.  That was awful.  It was god-awful.  Really?  Yeah.  It was like one line from Regan. 
[00:29:00]  Well, here's a taste of the Patsy Cline real fast.  He's down.  He's way down.  He's down.  Oh, my God.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  So, there you go.  I mean, you get the point there.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  But, yeah, here's the Brian Regan one you liked.  Well, the one problem I have with the Brian Regan one is he references a guy named Kevin  later on, but as far as production value, I liked it.  We didn't get that far.  No, I did.  I've listened to all of these.  That's the one difference between you guys.  I've had to listen to over 50 of these so far.  But here's the deal with stuff like this.  If it doesn't hit you within seconds, I know it stinks.  Dude, I know that, but the problem is none of them hit you like that.  No, you're right.  You're right about that.  Yeah, but you didn't like the Haller Simpson one, and yet this Brian Regan one, you're acting 
[00:30:00]  like it's something about Mary.  I broke my knee, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get some ice.  Get some ice.  Yeah.  You getting it?  Get some leaves.  Just leave.  You just want some water.  Can we get him some water?  Oh, my hand, man.  Do you want some water?  I've got to squeeze some.  You want to try and turn it on your side?  No, I can't.  I broke that fucking thing.  I broke it.  You've got to be right here.  I broke my leg, man.  I broke my leg, man. 
[00:30:30]  Where does it hurt?  Yeah.  Do you have the address on the phone?  Neither of these.  No, let me go direct.  Hey, Mom.  Okay.  Everything's fine.  Everything's fine.  I just want to run in at full speed and say hi.  Okay, so.  Oh, you know Kevin.  Okay, of course. 
[00:31:00]  Okay.  Well, you know how, like, his right arm, usually, usually it bends.  It's an arm thing.  Arm, wrong name.  I will rescind my commentary on this one.  That was a lot funnier at midnight.  Jesus.  Where were you, in the dentist's office with nitrous oxide on?  Dude, I generally sleep about four hours a night, and around midnight, I'm punchy as hell  when these things are coming in.  So, all right.  Stucks.  Because it was what happens.  Some of these guys make the mistake of they play eight minutes of one clip, and they throw 
[00:31:30]  in some line that might connect on some level somewhere, and it just doesn't.  It doesn't.  It's just, it's pretty much the raw Bob Kelly breaking his leg audio, and a couple of, like,  little things thrown in that don't really make much sense.  Why don't you throw the prior bit in about, you know, running up and the monkey sticking  his dick right in your ear.  Right, yeah.  You ran out of my arm.  Well, it's an arm.  It's a limb.  I broke my knee, man.  This one, this next one, oh, it was so close to being really, really good.  It's from Dan H. from Jersey. 
[00:32:00]  Mm-hmm.  Arthur Cheyenne getting fired.  Oh, right, yeah.  Because of the assault on the media.  Yeah.  Nathaniel holding up the O.P. and Anthony, uh, spread the virus sign.  Kind of like this one.  Not bad.  Ripping off the MTA, but as of today, transit officials are cracking down on subway swipers.  CBS 2's Arthur Cheyenne working our top story live from Midtown.  Arthur, good morning.  Good morning, Sean.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy a couple of, buy multiple Metro cars, stand at the turnstile,  and just continuously swipe people in all day. 
[00:32:30]  Police sources say these guys net a couple hundred dollars a day, and that's pure profit,  but it's costing the TA a great deal about $16 million a year, and they're trying to put  a stop to it.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  I broke my fucking knee, dude.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  I heard it break, dude.  What the fuck is your problem, man?  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  See, he went too far. 
[00:33:00]  That's what it was.  Should have been the quick, do it once, get out.  Why did he do it three times?  Because he's a triple scene climaxing ass.  Yeah, he had Arthur saying it three times, and then Bob saying his line three times.  Enough.  Well, here's Beth.  You're still on your way down.  I snapped my knee, man. 
[00:33:30]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  I want to hold your hand.  Oh, my God.  Oh, please.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, yeah.  Let me be your man.  Hold on, Ken.  And please.  God damn, man.  Say to me. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, fuck.  You'll let me hold your hand.  Hold on, Ken.  Hold on, Ken.  Oh, you motherfucker.  Hold on, Ken.  Oh, fuck.  That was not bad, right?  That's funny, and the isolated clip of him saying, hold my hand, is really funny.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  What a whiny mo.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  He could just as easily have been saying that to another man during a sad film. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Or during the scary part of A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Hold my hand.  One, two.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Ugh.  All right.  Let's get to...  Faggot.  Let's get through the rest of them, and we'll move on here.  Just a few more.  Bob Kelly and the Ruddles, Anthony.  This is from JM.  This one was pretty good, too.  Ah!  Ah!  Fuck!  I slapped my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man! 
[00:35:00]  Please, please hold my hand.  Hold my hand, man.  You want some more?  I've got to squeeze something.  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah.  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah.  Hold my hand, man.  I'll see you home.  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah.  Hold my hand, yeah, yeah.  I slapped my knee, man!  Hold my hand, I'll see you home.

This next one was from Blackout from Whackbag, Anthony.  Pulp Fiction when they bring out the gimp.  Yes, the whole gimp scene.  This is pretty good.  Not the gimp. 
[00:36:00]  Not the gimp sleeping.  Well, I guess you just have to go wake him up now, won't you?  I stabbed my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man!  I broke my knee, man! 
[00:36:30]  Goddamn, man!  there you have it you gotta know the scene obviously yeah well i think everybody knows

[00:47:30]  it's a credit  up  see that's how you do it  eric thinks he's gonna sidestep the landmine  but they're all landmines  you know what's so funny about that steve had no idea  no  and now you're playing into like oh see i knew  you didn't know  i had no idea  i was trying to help the program  i was trying to help  that is the most inaccurate god damn impression  it's a very good impression  it is not  it is not  it is not  i just didn't want to do with the consequences  i've never heard the word not 
[00:48:00]  i can hear the c the s and the q when you say consequences  i know  because those are the letters in the word  i know they are that's why i say it like that  but i don't but you you you put in this the semi-gay thing  no i don't  but i don't talk like this  no you don't  i put the semi  that's a great impression of his impression of you  that sounds  don't rip me off  doing you who who who  tell him fred  yeah  i don't put the gay thing in  no  of course you do  what do you think the flame boots do  add masculinity to it  what  they're charming 
[00:48:30]  whoa  don't use the word charming  charming  i'd say they're fabulous  yeah fabulous and charming  that's  sorry  heteros  never  i think it's funny i think i laugh at it but it's just inaccurate  you have perfect speech  perfect diction  i've read commercials for a long time man you have to you have to speak with perfect diction  all right  thanks  can you ever drag words together  no  never like you know you stream together  yeah  just tripping on them or whatever he never does that  like what are you doing  what are you doing  yeah whatever 
[00:49:00]  it's kind of like one word what are you doing  yeah  you take a tape of steve talk and you'll you'll hear a space in between every single word  right  even if he's speaking fast  that's a great answer  makes it easier to edit he says  that's right  to edit  that's right  you don't have to edit real life  edited  dude i edit everything i have these guys farming for drops all day long so everything's  potential fodder  all right thank you steve  i heard both d's and fodder  everything is potential fodder  where's the hypnotist  i'm going to find that out right now  all right good 
[00:49:30]  all right very good  all right  the bar is wrapped around a pole somewhere  i think my legs still work  we try to have a tough crowd  and a hypnotist  to try to get us hypnotized  i don't know what he was going to have me do  but he tried  patrice wouldn't do it  so i think that big fatso was afraid something creepy  afraid that it might work  yeah there's some people that are afraid it might work  and that's why they don't want to do it  but he yaps so much  that colin wanted to have one q-word  where patrice would be yapping  and he could just say it and just shut him up 
[00:50:00]  really  he'd always talk  yeah that would have been great  yeah  she wouldn't even try it  it didn't work  it wasn't gonna work  of course  well we'll see what happens when he comes in here  but you're usually too nice to the hypnotist over the years  i have been  yeah you sort of go along with it  nah  you're not believing  but i mean you're not  you're not saying anything you wouldn't say  but you're  that's true  you're being kind of quiet  yeah i'm  no i'm really gonna  you don't want to wreck everyone else's fun  because that's what it is  see  i'm not like eric 
[00:50:30]  he does look like a chicken  yeah  and they go  oh look at that  they're running around  and the guy thinks he's a football player  and he's throwing around  you know  and i'm like oh he's having fun  why  who am i to ruin people's fun  like our own hawk  i would rather just  go along  and actually let them have their fun  that's right  you really are a black spot on the lung of fun  could you edit out in the replay  where i actually said that joke before  and no one heard it  and i had to actually reiterate that 
[00:51:00]  the fun part  what'd you say  listen to the replay  everyone missed it  eric yeah  and i said hawk  i changed his name  it's a different joke totally  i stink  but at least it got a laugh  but i did do it twice  and i do realize i did it twice  two jews walk into a bar  they manage it  the best part of listening to the replays  is you find out that  all of us are bad listeners  oh awful  all of us  i hear things  that i'm in the same room with you people 
[00:51:30]  and on the replay i'm like  this is new to me  i was not listening to this at all  when do they talk about this report  yeah i have no idea  and i'm like i must have been reading feedback  or something  opi's going on about something  or jimmy's saying something  i'm like  i don't even know what subject they're talking about  it's so true  and then i pop in and say exactly the same thing opi just said  yeah well we all do our thing  but it's funny that  we're just bad listeners  horrible listeners  and i think that's what you need to have  you need to be a good listener to do this 
[00:52:00]  self-centered egotistical jackasses  we all are  we're all just trying to get our lines in  not listening to the other guys great line  stepping over them sometimes  because you want to get your stupid line in  of course  that's the battle  hardest part about acting is listening  like when you have to listen  it's about like relationships  and that's the hardest thing to do is listen  and react  yeah  because you're always like waiting to go  waiting to spit your line out  yeah  alright here's the deal  steve uh... the hypnotist is here  wacky porn guys are here  yeah  hypnotist  now the wacky porn guys are different 
[00:52:30]  than the strippers that came  they  they were the ones that helped  uh...  shut up  uh...  uh...  they are the ones that are actually in that  um...  where's that dvd i gave anthony  oh  over here  yeah well with the wacky guy  yeah the wacky guys are actually here  wacky guy porno  the wacky guys are actually here  and they helped us get the girls  so  okay  we'll see what they're about  and the hypnotist salish is here as well  alright very good  alright  salish  cool  cool  do they have uh... the magnificent or 
[00:53:00]  the amazing before it  the magnificent after  no not really  he kinda looks like marcellus wallace though  oh yeah  yeah  oh  hey there he is  how you doing sir  yes  alright  what does he put up his fist and say you're hypnotized  i'm pretty fucking far from okay  you're feeling sleepy while i get medieval on your ass  fucker jesus christ  this is the guy that feed up adam baldwin and my bodyguard  leave him alone moody 
[00:53:30]  i'm more hypnotized motherfucker  alright here we go  anyone else see this show last night hit me baby one more time  no i doubt i read about it in the paper yesterday and i missed it  it's a great  i didn't watch it  it's a great idea for a show it really is  i love any of the old nostalgia shows on mtv or vh1 or any of those  you know the the uh... eighties  what is it called  i love the eighties  and i love the nineties  part do 
[00:54:00]  and i love the two thousands  oh  i love the year two thousand four  you know that's coming soon  i like the eighties one they did  that was pretty cool  and then they they like made part do  and uh...  they just kinda ran out of stuff  part do is all the stuff that  couldn't make the didn't make the cut  yeah they didn't make the cut for the first one  so why would you make a whole show about it  yeah  because they're scumbags  because they're they because the eighties did so well  that they figured they'd do it again and they just didn't have enough uh...  real good material 
[00:54:30]  memorable eighties stuff  you can't do anything mean with these things like you like with the clip shows right with a show clip  you know and you comment which is perfect for what's going on in hollywood  because there's no real creativity you know you don't have to create anything just show old clips let you know  true  um...  they never leave anything mean it should be fun  hey and then i'll show five guys doing the same line  you know i mean  uh... go ahead make my day  go ahead make my day five of the actors  yeah  fucking have some dignity  i love when they ask you to say the line  no i'm not saying  oh really they ask you that 
[00:55:00]  would you rather have a show of the uh...  the shuttle exploding and then do they need another seven astronauts joke or something  it's a nice eighties moment  i said mud light  give me that one  of course  or wet their seven lips and stick them to the window  jesus  horrid  all right here we go  so hit me baby one more time  this is the concept  basically they bring back some old bands that you haven't really heard from in a long time 
[00:55:30]  and uh... i guess most of these bands were huge in the eighties i guess they're going with that whole eighties thing again  and they get the band said to the to go on stage and and do their hit  and then later they come back and they do a current hit song  right  it's not a bad idea actually you know  do they have to still be in existence or a lot of these guys getting back together for this  i think they're they kind of tour there they never really went away but they sure aren't playing the arenas anymore  yeah they were talking about uh... they were talking to the flock of seagulls guy 
[00:56:00]  and the band has been touring ever since  still touring  yeah it's pretty much just him and his friends though  i mean he got rid of the other guys because you know they who were they really  you only need like  and him  and he lives in florida with a uh... a wife that can only be described as a crack addict  really  she looks awful and he likes boating and he still sings his flock of seagulls songs  does he have the hair  he's got the like rat eyes  rat eyes  and he has some kind of version of  no actually i think it's just in a ponytail or something 
[00:56:30]  because he had the whole swept forward  what they called the flock of seagulls hair do of course  but basically what this show does  what a coincidence that he had that hair do  dude it worked out perfectly for everybody  before that it was called the other man's hands in your hair pulling you down into his lap do  but basically what this show does is show us all that time is just a bitch  ah you can't beat it  no one beats time  weapon against it  no one beats time 
[00:57:00]  we can start with lover boy actually you got the original song  so lover boy everyone remembers the song working for the weekend right  how could you forget opie  your old station wbab  used to play it every friday  i used to listen to the uh...  the friday afternoon happy hour  who used to do that  um...  wasn't ralph was it  well ralph and uh... jerry jerry martier  here  that's right  and and uh... the friday afternoon happy hour  and it would always kick off opie with 
[00:57:30]  working for the weekend because  what were we all doing during the week  we were just working for the weekend  that's it  and then you'd bang on your drum all day  they'd play that and  of course  it was a great radio back then  uh... brian from uh... north carolina  brian  hey what's going on you guys  hey uh... do you notice tiffany's uh... spare tire  oh man tiffany is just a train wreck now  really  she's had a few kids whatever  and we talk about bouncing back  oh she did not bounce back 
[00:58:00]  she didn't snap back  because she's not even that old  because in the 80s  she was a kid  she was just a kid  so she's probably in her thirties i guess  yeah  mid thirties maybe  where you could just see like her chest  everything else  okay you know her boobs got a little bigger  from being pregnant  and then they scanned down  yeah it was some kind of like  it was kind of like some see-through  tent  kind of i don't know  yeah the outfit was just meant to  to hide a bunt and a belly  really  oh yeah yeah  but you could see  camouflage wear 
[00:58:30]  yeah  you could see what's going on down there  alan from virginia what's up  i just wondered if uh...  i was the only one that thought that  lead singer from flock of seagulls  look like a full grown verne troyer  oh that's not bad  that is not bad at all man  all right guys  i see the photoshop uh... happening as we speak  all right so here's the original lover boy  doing working for the weekend  the song we've heard a million times  on the radio okay  everyone's watching to see what you will do  whoo yeah 
[00:59:00]  everyone's looking at you  oh  everyone's wondering to see what you will do  Is your headband on, Opie?  I put mine on for this song.  Everyone's trying to get it right, get it right. 
[00:59:30]  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody wants a little romance.  Everybody's going off the deep end.  Everybody needs a second chance.  Who can forget that? 
[01:00:00]  Of course.  You get the idea.  There's the original, right?  You crank it on the way home.  One thing I remember about that video on MTV,  when the drummer hit the cymbal on that last thing,  they would freeze frame it,  and he was making the dopiest faces.  That's all I remember about that video.  And the stupid red headband.  And, well, here's Loverboy from last night's show  doing the same exact song.  How many years are we looking at here?  It's got to be 20, right?  20 years.  Okay, let's hear what 20 years adds to the song. 
[01:00:30]  Adds a little drop in the key.  Everyone's watching to see what you will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Arr!  Arr!  Everyone's wondering  The way you come out tonight  Everyone's trying to get it right 
[01:01:00]  Get it right  Everybody's working for the weekend  Everybody wants a new romance  Everybody's going on the tape  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Everybody needs a second chance  Stop whining!  Stop it!  You want a piece of my heart 
[01:01:30]  You made a strong start  You want to be in the show  Can't move, baby, let's go  All right, we belted that out.  Wow!  You think they were that bad?  I think it was pretty...  Well, there's a big drop-off, let's be honest.  I mean, John from New Orleans, he's online  and he wants to say that Loverboy plays 100 dates a year.  That is true.  They're still touring like crazy, but...  That's a hot ticket, I bet.  But time is...  Wow.  Not kind. 
[01:02:00]  They definitely have to tune down for that song these days.  It definitely wasn't where it used to be.  And then we kind of missed a few notes.  Yeah, well then they came back later on in the program  and they sang a current song.  Is that what the theme of the show is?  They sing their hit and then they sing a new song.  You might want to listen to the replay.  He just proves the point we made.  I'll listen to that later and see that I just reiterated  what you had said already. 
[01:02:30]  You're just awful listeners.  Because now that we acknowledge that we don't listen,  now we're going to point it out.  Oh yeah, all day long.  It's really funny, actually.  That's exactly what I said.  I was so busy.  So when are you going to play these Loverboy songs?  So here's Loverboy doing Hero by Enrique Iglesias.  Just a taste.  Thank you.  Would you dance 
[01:03:00]  If I asked you to dance  Would you run  And never look back  Would you die  Hold me in your arms tonight  I can be your hero, baby  I can kiss away the pain 
[01:03:30]  It's not bad  It's not bad  But it's like every lounge act I've ever seen  Horrible  I can kiss away the pain  It's a pretty original lyric, though  That's pretty good  That's not hacky  Let's go to Pete in Connecticut  Pete?  Yeah, you know  I'm getting a little tired  You know, the whole phrase  Time is just a bitch  You know, it's just getting way overused  You know, I'm just sick and tired 
[01:04:00]  I'm going to reach through my  I'm just going to kill myself  All right, I just want to say hi, meaty tits  You guys suck  And I'll question out  See you later  He's trying  All right, Joe and Josie  Breathing heavy and looking at the phone  After we hit end  Joe and Josie  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Real fast  Let's go, Joe  Hey, during the Loverboy song  In the 80s  I'd drop a headband around my car  And have girls take their clothes off  Because I invented Loverboy  Hoo, hoo, hoo  Tell them, Fred  Tell them, Fred  All right, thanks, bro  All right, you want to hear  The Flock of Seagulls thing?  Sure  The contrast  Flock of Seagulls came out in what? 
[01:04:30]  Like, 82, 83?  Early 80s, yeah  Yeah, I ran  Here's a little taste of I ran  Bad video there, too  Good song, though  Early 80s video  Still like that song  When that comes on  I still will listen to that thing  I'll put it up  Listen to the words 
[01:05:00]  And, well  Unfortunately, when you go to the 80s channel  You don't hear that cut  The 80s channel  You'll hear some deep track off of  The 80s channel stinks  They won't play I ran?  Why?  No, what happened  With the decade channels  Like, when you think 80s  You're thinking  This is the problem  Yeah  You're thinking new wave  Big time, okay?  Big time  You're thinking like  Thomas Dolby  And Flock of Seagulls  But they throw all  Of the 80s songs in there  So all the pop songs and stuff  So you've got to wait 
[01:05:30]  Through a lot of crap  To hear what you  To get to like  You remember from the 80s  One of the good ones  The reason you're going to the 80s  To hear one of those  You know, nostalgic  The station you're talking about  Is Fred  Yeah  Fred is the  Quote new wave station  Mm-hmm  But it's all obscure  Deep tracks from the bands you love  Yeah  For the most part  Mm-hmm  I would hang out  At Fred for hours  I can't sit through the bullshit  Tell them, Fred  It's like Thomas Dolby  But they don't play  Blinded by Science  I want to hear  Blinded Me with Science  Or whatever, yeah 
[01:06:00]  Blinded by, yeah  They'll play some  Deep, deep track  From Thomas Dolby  How many people  Are really sitting there  In their car  You know, enjoying that  Did Thomas Dolby  Have another track?  I don't  Did he have another song?  Blinded Me with Science  Yeah, Blinded Me with Science  I remember he had a song  Called Hyperactive  I think, right?  Oh, right, okay  Was that him?  Which was not  I mean, this song  I remember that  Airhead  Yeah  An airhead, that's right  He's an airhead  There he is  I want to like  This Fred Station  But it's just  Way too obscure 
[01:06:30]  And deep  I remember this  Remember this one?  This song took forever  To start back then  I was hooked to a machine  Just to keep my mouth  From spouting junk  Must have took me  You don't like  The Thomas Dolby, Jimmy?  He does  It's not Ozzy  No, it's not Ozzy  I like a lot of things  I like Iran  I like the  You know, it's a terrible 
[01:07:00]  I didn't like  Blinded Me with Science  I didn't get it  XM is missing the boat  They need  They need one channel  That focuses on  The hits of New Wave  And it would be a smash  A smash  But, I mean  It's  They're not  They're not catering  To that  That group of people  Because the 80's channel  You have to sit through  Way too much stuff  To, you know  Get that New Wave stuff  And the Fred stuff  Is very, very obscure  For the most part  Yeah, they definitely  Need a chill channel  As well  Without a doubt  Chill is 
[01:07:30]  Our buddy Liquid Todd  Does it  It's amazing  Oh, is that a channel  That you would have to  Take massive amounts  Of drugs to listen to?  No, no, no  No, no, no  It's on the competitor  But it's cool  It's, I don't know  It's a little bit of everything  It's mellow  That's cool  It's, it's just a great mix  Of like mellow songs  But by bands  You really know  And stuff  And then throw some stuff  In there you don't know  But it just seems to work  No Ozzy though, Jim  I don't need Ozzy  Let's  Let's go to Tom in Texas 
[01:08:00]  What's up, Tom?  Hey, guys  Hey  Hey, sweet bitch  Hi  Uh, wait  Just letting you know  Um, I don't know  If you ever saw  The behind the music  On Loverboy  Um, the lead singer  Is the most fair  Son of a bitch  And he sits there  And goes  Well, you know  I was stationed  My big career comeback  And then Nirvana came along  So he blamed Nirvana  For their shitty, shitty songs  Oh my  A comeback?  Yeah  He was  Planned this huge comeback  And then Nirvana came out 
[01:08:30]  With Smells Like Teen Spirit  And he's like  Well, yeah  That's why we're not huge  That's why  It's because of Nirvana  Well, if he had the talent  Of Kurt Cobain  He would have, you know  He would have thrown out  Some, uh  Some  Some hit songs  After Nirvana hit  Well, he's like  Whoa, it's Loverboy  Come on  Rock on  It just shows you  Some kind of packaged thing  That the record company  Has invented  If you have to blame  Like, you know  A trend from, you know  From kicking you 
[01:09:00]  Out of the business  What was another hit by Loverboy?  They had another song  Besides Working for the Weekend?  Which is really cool  It just gets me  Juiced  You're working for the weekend  Yeah, good point  Um, Loverboy  Um, uh  The Kid is Hot Tonight  Oh  I got one  The Kid  Is Hot Tonight  Oh  So Hot Tonight  Oh, I think I remember this  But where will he be tomorrow?  See?  They were kind of  Seeing their own future 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  This music always reminds me  Of driving a shitty car  And having no money  That's right  Toolbag 
[01:10:00]  From Long Island  Rick Delgado's  Favorite band  Loverboy  Remember that?  One of them  I think  We ragged him once  For hours on end  For going to a Loverboy concert  Once  Let's say hi to Scott  Scott, what's up?  Uh, not much  I just wanted to say  You guys are talking about  Well, it's not strictly new wave  But the hit channel  You're talking about is Lucy  Yeah, but Lucy does  Um, mostly 90s  Yeah  They do 80s  They do 90s  I, I, I  Honestly  If they do 
[01:10:30]  I haven't heard it  I, I hear nothing but 90s  I, I actually like Lucy a lot  I like  Mark's a good station  Did you ever hear of Mark?  Where they only  They only play things  By like young black groups  Like  Uh, the Jackson 5s  All their stuff  And, uh, you know  Pass the duchy  By musical youth  Let's say hi to Greg  Hi  Hey  Hey guys  Uh, I heard Tiffany  On there  Uh, on the radio  Two days ago  Talk about how she's not 
[01:11:00]  Technically a has-been  Cause she has new hits out  Oh, okay  Really  Um, can anyone name  A new Tiffany song?  I can't even name an old one  Yeah  Uh, thank you  She did a, she did a remake  Right?  Years ago?  Wasn't that her big, uh, hit?  Uh, alright  Two of them?  Alright, let's get back to this  So give us the Flock of Seagulls again  The original  Cause now we went off on a tangent  Just, uh, really quick  Here's Flock of Seagulls  So that's the song we all know and love, right? 
[01:11:30]  Yes  Or some of us love  Okay  And, uh, here's Flock of Seagulls  Doing that same song last night  I walk along the avenue 
[01:12:00]  I never thought I'd meet a girl like you  Meet a girl like you  It's like karaoke  Is this the B-52s?  Oh  Oh  I walk along the avenue 
[01:12:30]  Love Shack  With all the hair and tawny eyes  The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through  You hypnotize me through  And I ran  I ran so far away  You should have stayed there  I ran all night and day  I couldn't get away  Wow 
[01:13:00]  A little different, huh?  Yeah  A little different  Anyway  Wow  No Tiffany?  Yeah, honestly  I don't think she did that bad  Yeah  Someone, uh, brings up a good point about Tiffany  Eric in Colorado  Uh, Orlando, actually  Eric, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  You're my favorite comedian of all time, first off  Thanks, man  Hey, uh, question  Um, I just figured out another hit song by Loverboy  You guys remember the I Don't Want to Lose Your Love song? 
[01:13:30]  No  How'd it go?  That was another big one  How'd it go?  How'd it go?  I don't want to lose your love tonight  That's got that long, like, little guitar beat  Oh, yeah  And then, and I heard you guys say something about Tiffany  I've got that Playboy issue  I mean, she doesn't look as good as she used to  But, you know, she looks okay  But the Tiffany, um, that came out only a few years ago, right?  Yeah, I think it was, I think it was a 2002 issue, yeah  Because something happened between 2002 and last night 
[01:14:00]  Because I remember seeing her in Playboy  Her body was awesome  Really?  Was that recent?  Just a couple of years?  I think so, yeah  Yeah, it wasn't too bad  Maybe she's pregnant with another kid or something  And she was just kind of hiding that  I know she married a Spanish guy  That did have two or three kids  But, yeah, that could do it  Right, okay  Thank you, Eric  I missed her  Oh, yeah, Turn Me Loose  Thanks, Craig, from PA  Turn Me Loose by Loverboy  Yes, of course  This is, uh, Tad from San Francisco  San Francisco  Where's Steve? 
[01:14:30]  Tad from San Francisco  Tad from San Francisco  He says, this is why I want all my musical heroes  To take a lot of drugs and kill themselves at 35  Can you imagine Cobain trying to crank out  Rape Me or Heart Shaped Box in 10 more years?  Whew  Yeah  I just wanted one more album from Nirvana  How many did they put out?  It depends  Yeah, you never really know with those bands  How many they really put out  It depends  Uh, commercially, I guess, officially, uh  I don't know  Because Insecticide and 
[01:15:00]  I don't know  They had two big albums  Would you really want to see  Big, huge  Main releases  Jim Morrison  And the Doors in Atlantic City or something?  No, no  Hey, the Stones are still doing good, though  Yeah, that's really an oddity  That really is an oddity, you know  It's one in a million  But you know what?  There's also bands like  Believe it or not  U2 has been around 25 years  Yeah, but they started when they were like 10  You know, that's another thing 
[01:15:30]  Well, those guys are in their mid-tupper 40s now, right?  Yeah  So they're pretty much the same age  As some of these bands we're listening to right now  Yeah  But for some reason  They were able to keep up their creativity  And keep their voices  And keep, uh, you know  Keep everything current  Yeah  Yeah, they're actually able to grow as a band  And not sound, uh, dated  Right  Bands like U2 and Night Ranger and the Stones  I mean, they just, they hold up  Night Ranger!  Those are some of the guilty pleasures 
[01:16:00]  You want to hear on the 80s channel, though  You want to hear a little Night Ranger  When you pop on the 80s channel  That's why you're going there  What was their song?  Well, there was Sister Christian  Sister Christian, yeah  And then there was  Sister Christian  And then there was that other one  It was Sister Christian  I don't know it  Then there was that other one  Sister Melanie  Those bands always had that second song  That kind of sounded like the hit 
[01:16:30]  Yeah  It's like the hit's sideways  Yeah, and the radio would play it  For a little while  Because they were desperate  For something else off the album  Because it was such a smash  Remember this one, Jimmy?  I don't know, but it sounds good  You know what you have is  When you play Grand Theft Auto Vice City  Yeah  We have this master computer  And that's the only song listed  By Night Ranger  Really?  It's just this one?  Yeah, Sister Christian  And this has every song  Like you can imagine in it  Sister Christian  Oh, the time has come 
[01:17:00]  It's the big ballad  The big power ballad  And you know that you're the only one  Yeah  Every rocker has his soft side  Okay  Love soft  You know what gives me goosebumps?  What?  When he goes  And you're motoring  Oh, yeah  Oh, all right  I know that  It's the big power ballad  The hair stands up, man  Oh  Come on, remember this? 
[01:17:30]  Look, I'm getting the goosebumps already  Right here  The drum kicks in  Right here  Come on  Oh, yeah  Boogie Nights drug deal scene  That's right  There it is  Yes  Very good scene  Yeah  Yeah, man  These guys rock, man  Yeah, okay 
[01:18:00]  All right  Thank you  All right  What, are we going to do it all day?  Come on  I actually preferred the Dirk Diggler song  Boogie Nights to this one  Here's Tiffany from last night  Okay  Children behave  That's what they say  When we're together  I watch how you play  They don't understand  And so we're running  Just as fast as we can 
[01:18:30]  All right  Pulling out who I've never said  She's there  Yeah, it's really not that bad at all  It's not bad  No, we don't need the original  But anyway, you get the point  It's a pretty cool show  It's kind of interesting to take a peek  All right, we should take a break  We got  I invented reality television  Of course you did, Howard  Everyone knows it  I got to tell you, though  One of the best reality shows on TV 
[01:19:00]  Is that goddamn stupid crab fishing show  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing  What the hell was the crab fishing show?  The most dangerous catch  On Discovery Channel  You ever hear about this?  No  They put cameras on a bunch of these ships  That go out into the Bering Sea  In Alaska  I thought they put cameras on toilet seats  No  What are you talking about?  Crab fishing  Crab fishing  They put them on all these crabbing boats  And they go out into the Bering Sea  They're by Alaska  And they go crabbing 
[01:19:30]  Now you'd think  Okay  How is that a TV show?  Apparently this is like  One of the most dangerous jobs in the world  People dying all the time  And it's a reality show  Because they follow these people's lives  And personalities and their jobs  And what we've all wanted to see on reality shows  People are dropping dead  Really?  People are dying  They show the captain of some ship  Showing how to put on some emergency gear  And then they're out on a boat  And one of the cameramen 
[01:20:00]  See the captain on the radio  And the ship capsized  Sunk  The captain that was just doing the little thing on his gear  And six of his crewmen are dead  And another guy falls overboard  He's dead  People are getting injured all the time  This is reality  Why else would you watch a crab fishing show?  I hope they bring up a bunch of crabs  You've got to interview the crabs  You have new deaths every week  It's like a holocaust 
[01:20:30]  The crab holocaust  Unbelievable  But I got roped into watching this  I'm watching it now all the time  Most dangerous catch  I never knew the show was on TV  I sit there doing the Regan bit  I'm watching fishing  I'm not even fishing  I'm watching fishing  But is the crab show  It's just being filmed  There's no phony reality angle  No it's just these guys  They're all a little kooky  To be out there  They work for  It's only a few days  A couple of times a year 
[01:21:00]  That they do this  And they could walk away  With upwards of 10-15 grand each  For just a few days work  But it's just the worst job ever  There's no immunity challenge?  No  No challenges  Actually they do have a Budweiser  Sponsored crab count  With which ship brings in  The most pounds of crab  They should have like a body count  Because people are dropping dead  There was one ship  Just keeled over  And they found out 
[01:21:30]  That they had too many  Of these crab traps on it  And it was top heavy  Overloaded  The captain  Yeah  Screwed up  And paid with his life  Was that like  By Lake Gitchaguni  It was like  Was it going from Cleveland  Into Canada somewhere  And there was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald  Well our crab pots were full  And we came into shore  And  I really like that song  That Jimmy was asking  His questions  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot  This song goes on forever 
[01:22:00]  I love it though  Jesus  And the water was at my ankles  And this song goes on  Another hour  Is that the song  That makes you just get  All tingly Jimmy?  I just like it  Because I like the fact  That he's doing  A 40 minute ballad  About a boat that sang  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald  I looked at the fuel gauge  It was three quarters full  And we motored on  Toward our destination  And then we bought  A Rolls Royce on eBay  Hey we could kill seven minutes  Let this play today  Oh my god  He asked for my money back 
[01:22:30]  He said drop dead  You horse tooth shoe  You're getting nothing back  The legend lives on  From the Chippewa home down  It's a big lake  They call Gitchagumi  Gitchagumi  Alright  The lake it is said  Never gives up for dead  When the skies of November  Turn gloomy  Gloomy  Get your gloomy with gloomy  With a load of iron ore  26,000 tons more  Than the Edmund Fitzgerald  We'd empty  I smelt bad from fish 
[01:23:00]  And put on perfumey  That good ship and true  Was a bone to be chewed  When the gills of November  Came early  They cast off yet?  We untied the bow line  And untied the stern  And I started the engine  With a turn of the key  Jesus  Every friggin' step of the way  In the Edmund Fitzgerald  We get it already  We get it  You're on a boat  I took a compass heading of 135  And I turned the wheel  And the purser got me my coffee  I take it light and sweet 
[01:23:30]  But he made it too dark  And I sent them back to the galley  Alright  What happened?  What happened next?  I went to sleep  And I had sleep paralysis  And I woke up to the exorcist's face  In my bed  It was on forever  The wind and the wire  And the tattletale sound  And the wave  Flirted over the railing  This song's only half over 
[01:24:00]  And I still see the dark  I forgot my wallet in my car  So we turned the ship around  And we docked again  And I figured I'd stop for a beer  When afternoon came  It was creasin' rain  Tune in and two hours later  When the ship finally sinks  Enough!  And then they're just 
[01:24:30]  Throwing a musical interlude  To make it longer  Christ!  I put on my life vest  And helped my crew put it on too  And we stood there  And well the water's now up to our knees  It's too rough to feed you  See look  It's still going!  We'll take a few phone calls  And we'll go back to the song in a minute  Scott in Arizona  What's up Scott? 
[01:25:00]  Hey how you guys doing this morning?  Pretty good  What's up?  Hey don't get me wrong here  You guys are great man  I mean I love the shit out of you guys  But I got a little  I got a little complaint about the crabbing thing  I spent 15 years up in Alaska  Commercial fishing  And then I just got my big truck this morning  And boom  First thing I turned you guys on this morning  You guys are complaining about the show  What?  Yeah  Who's complaining?  Oh you said you didn't like it  And then you're making fun of a bunch of  I love the crab show 
[01:25:30]  That's what I was saying  Were you listening?  Or were you like me?  You're not listening  You better listen to the replay  Listen to the replay  I love the crab show  I said I can't stop watching it  Oh I apologize  My brain fart  My thing was  I was saying that all crabbers  Are bums and incompetents  Anthony was disagreeing  Well I have to agree with you there  Alright thank you  We're going to move on  Tad again from San Francisco  I watched the History Channel show  On the Edmund Fitzgerald  It took three minutes for the boat to sink  So it takes longer for the song to play 
[01:26:00]  Than it took for the boat to actually sink  Well let's see where the song is  Alright where are we?  We'll go back to the song in a little while  And see what happens  I said hey dude  What do you think about this?  He said I don't know  There might be a hole in the boat  So we went down to the engine room  And yeah there was a hole  And we sat and smoked a cigarette or two  Because it really wasn't that bad  Let's say hi to Alex in Boston  Alex? 
[01:26:30]  Hey guys  Hey  I got two points  Jimmy don't you play  The most dangerous catch every night?  That's not bad  Not bad  Jimmy tangling with some tainted vagina  It's me on a boat with three Craigslist prostitutes  And crabs are involved also  Very nice  And Rick Ross buys the car  Like people buy drugs  Give him the money first  Wait and  I'll come back with the car  Uh oh  Oh boy  You should have started with that one  Speaking of cars  Alright thank you sir 
[01:27:00]  Thanks  Let's go back to the song  And see where Gordon Lightfoot is  At  Uh oh  Take a sound  Yeah  Alright we'll check back  He's still in that musical interlude  Who's that other ballad singer?  Oh Steve Flamefoot  He's like  With the Captain Wyatt invented water coming in  He's flamefoot 
[01:27:30]  Oh 27,000 times more than the Edmund Fitzgerald  He's separated the tea and the tea  We have a little problem  The striples  They won't take their clothes off  Striples?  The striples  Yes  They're kind of like an Australian children's naked singing group  Alright before we go to break  Let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is here  Alright  He's still going? 
[01:28:00]  Music  Jesus  Does anyone know where the love of God goes  When the waves turn the minutes to hours  Minutes to hours  The searchers all say  They'd have made whitefish pay  If they'd put 15 more miles behind her  Huh?  They might have split up  Or they might have capsized  They may have broke deep  And took water  And all that remains is 
[01:28:30]  The faces and the names  Of the wives and the sons and the daughters  Alright, we'll go back to Gordon Lightfoot after the break  He's still singing along  Now he's singing about the survivors and everything  The wife remarried and had three kids  And can't even remember his name  Been 15 years and now I'm gonna sing  About his children's experience in elementary school 
[01:29:00]  That's a bit of a long tune  Oh, Christ  I think we were making that point, Jimmy  Oh  That's true  I just jump in like  Hey guys, I have a thought  That's a long song  Long song  Gordon  You've come  Gordon Lightfoot  Heavy on the pen, though  And my typewriter ran out of ink 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  He doesn't get to the end  Oh, that's hilarious  Let's go to Chris in New Jersey  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing, Chicken Lips?  That's very mean-spirited  What?  What?  What's painful?  What?  That fucking song  That Gordon Lightfoot song  You don't like that song?  No, dude  It's fucking horrible  It's not horrible  Yeah  Oh, it's terrible  What do you prefer?  What kind of song do you prefer?  If I could just jump in 
[01:30:00]  And make a relative comparison?  Anything but that  That's a little vague, sir  I'll listen to Brother Joe's Journey covers  You know  I just don't do it  This is all I have to say  First of all  Loverboy did not do that fucking song  With The Outfield  That I Want to Lose Your Love Tonight  Oh, yeah  It was The Outfield  Very good  And Night Ranger's other song  Was Don't Tell Me You Love Me  Oh, that's right  Oh, that was a huge hit  Yeah, I remember that  Thank you, Chris  Very informative  You don't like Gordon Lightfoot  But you know Night Ranger  And Loverboy songs from 1981  Yeah, well, come on, dude 
[01:30:30]  1981, I was around then  Like, I wasn't around  And whatever the hell  When did that song come out?  That Gordon Lightfoot?  I'm guessing in the mid-70s  Probably after the actual accident  All right  Yeah, my parents were eating granola  And I wasn't born yet, so  All right, thank you, Chris  All right, guys  We've got to get back to Gordon Lightfoot  Where is he at in this stupid song of his?  Lake Huron rolls  Superior seams  In the rooms of her ice water mansion  Oh, Michigan steams 
[01:31:00]  Like a young man's dreams  The islands and days are for sportsmen  Then the sun's supernova  Then the earth was burned to a crisp  And it's 50 billion years in the future  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot  We're Mylar suits  And we colonize Mars  And Danley  Danny finally got a sign  On the TV show  God, did I fuck that one up?  And Danley finally got a sign  On the TV show 
[01:31:30]  I wouldn't hurt you, Danley  I love every goddamn  Half a sign on your head  Then when should we take Danley  To see a doctor?  As soon as possible  Oh, I'm an elsehole  Danley  Oh, that's funny  Devin from New Hampshire  Andrea Yates played that song  As she drowned her kids  And the next one looked up and said 
[01:32:00]  Hey, what's going on here, Mom?  When the bubbles stop  Four more to go  And the workers  The searchers all say  They'd have made 21  If this bitch had taken her medicine  Five little unopened boxes under the tree  Well, speaking of Gordon Lightfoot 
[01:32:30]  And two disappointed grandparents  Let's see where Gordon is in the song  As I set off to sail from Modesto  A splash and a tear  As my wife disappeared  Neat the blue briny waters of Modesto  Are we finally at the end? 
[01:33:00]  I don't know  Oh  Is that it?  In a musty old hall in Detroit  They prayed in the Maryland Sailor's Cathedral  Oh, she said Reagan now  The church bell chimes  If it rang 29 times  Five times  The rich man on the end  It's Gerald  Legend lives on  From the Chippewa 
[01:33:30]  Down of the big lake  They call  It's Chippewa  All right, we'll get back to Gordon Lightfoot  That's when I hear the line where he says  A grandmother's wasted charm bracelet  As Grandma sadly looks at the bottle of Johnson's baby shampoo  Unceremoniously dumps it in the toilet  Because it's useless  And the quack of a rubber ducky in the trash pile 
[01:34:00]  That is wrong  You are the worst  You're the worst  Holy Jesus  This is hysterically awful  All my chest 
[01:34:30]  Let's see if we can get to the end of the song  Susan Smith sent the van down the boat ramp  Two little tykes in their car seat  She said, you little cock blockers  It's been nice to know you  The big one said  Mommy, why is we going backwards? 
[01:35:00]  And she went on the news  And pointed that Coco had taken her children  Speaking of the song  Let's see if  Let's see where Gordon Lightfoot is 
[01:35:30]  Oh, there it is  Fading out  Wow, finally, we made it to the end  Thank God  I got tears coming down my cheeks  Hey, let's say hi to Scott  Scott, what's up?  Hey, dude, why don't you guys bring your show to a screeching hall 
[01:36:00]  And play Alice's Restaurant  It's not Thanksgiving  That's right  N.E.W. played that for years  They'll waste product  N.E.W. when we worked there  They were so proud of the fact  That they played Alice's Restaurant  Every Thanksgiving morning  Yeah  And to this day  I don't really get what the tie-in is  How long is the song?  Is it a long song?  Well, the whole gist is that  It's Thanksgiving in the song  The song is like 20 minutes long  I guess you have to listen to the song  To realize what it meant 
[01:36:30]  In Thanksgiving time  Yeah  All right, thank you, Scott  Let's say hi to Sally in Illinois  Sally  Hi  If you want to waste another half hour  Play MacArthur Park  Oh, Jesus  I never could even understand that one  I'll never have that recipe again  Why did someone leave a cake out in the rain?  It took so long to bake it  Who would be silly enough to leave a cake out in the rain?  Someone did  And then  I don't think that I can take it  Because it took so long to bake it 
[01:37:00]  And I'll never have that recipe again  Jesus  God  Who did that song originally?  Because there's a million versions of it  I never paid attention  I tried not to  Yeah, all right  I think I know that  I think that I can take it  Is that how it goes?  Yeah  Wait, go over this way  Yeah, like  Yeah, that's the version right there  Let me see  Go over  Yeah  Let me see if that's  I'm still recouping  I know, that's why we're just kind of 
[01:37:30]  Let's see what this is  Go  By David Syme  Or Sim  Is this an instrumental?  No, no  Sounds like an instrumental  The one that was a hit  Was done by  That's what I'm asking  By the actor 
[01:38:00]  What's his name?  Victor Moan?  No  Andy Williams?  No  What the hell is his name?  Jerry  Roman Polanski?  I don't know  Someone left the 14-year-old out in the rain  Someone left the cake out in the rain  And it had 13 candles on it  Apparently someone left some semen on some grommels too, stupid  I don't think that I should fuck it 
[01:38:30]  I was trying to raise my own, but Manson's a cock blocker  Jesus  I don't know  Richard, um, Richard  Yeah, Richard  What's his name?  Yeah, Richard Harris  Richard Harris did this song?  Yeah  Everyone did this song 
[01:39:00]  Didn't Paul Anka do it?  It's only seven and a half minutes long  Oh, this is a short one  This big long  Piano  Horn intro  Spring was never waiting for us, girl  It ran one step ahead  As we followed in the dance  What?  What is he even saying? 
[01:39:30]  Between departed pages  And repressed in ross of fevered arms  Like a striped pair of pants  Someone left the children in the tub  Oh my god, we can't do it  This goes on and on  I wish I had more hands so I could kill more than two at a time  Yeah, Todd makes a good point from Florida 
[01:40:00]  Donna Summer made that song out  She did, oh, well, yeah  That was the, uh  Okay, yeah  The big disco remix  Jay from Virginia  Hey, guys  How you doing, O&A?  Hey  Hey, man  Hey, buttertits  What up?  Hey, uh  I'd like to make a request for Iron Butterflies in the Gata DeVita  Exactly 
[01:40:30]  All right, well, I guess we've got to take a break now  So, thank you, sir  Thanks to that caller  We were all having fun and look what happened  A lot of laughs  No, no problem  We'll regroup  Did we take a break?  One  We took one?  I don't even remember  I remember we were going to go into break  These guys are all bored out there  We've got to get everybody in, man  Sorry, we're just laughing our asses  They're all like  We do a show for ourselves  Sorry  The strippers are nodding off  The food is rotting  In the dark 
[01:41:00]  Even the hypnotist at this point admits it's all an act  They just have had it  They've had it out there  Someone left the bagels out in the office  All right, well  And we've got Ralphie Mae outside with Joey Diaz  We had a lot of fun with those guys yesterday  And we're going to have more fun with them today  You've got The Touch  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Biggie Nights, of course  Love it  No, we've really got to take a break  And regroup here  Let's see how this comes out  All right  They're right there  All right, here we go  I've got to take a break 
[01:41:30]  I've got to take a break  I've got to take a break  Ah, this is nice  Oh, yeah  This is a story about a man  And he always was so lonely at night  But his voice was rowdy  You could hear it all through this train station  And I'm going to sing this one  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy  Let's go  Oh, yeah  You played that night 
[01:42:00]  And now you have nowhere to go  And money's gone  And also, oh, my friend  And the cop says to me  Hey, you smell bad  Get out of here  And he says  And you don't have an angel  And he says, that is you  Shelter me from the falling rain 
[01:42:30]  You have bombs  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  Shelter me  Shelter me from the falling rain  You have bombs  This is my life 
[01:43:00]  I'm living with so much pain  There's just a little peace  Raffi and Anthony  XM202  Are you breathing?  Are you breathing?  Now, now, bring up  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the biggies 
[01:43:30]  Now, someone is going to die  When you listen to me  Listen to me, die  Listen to me, die  Say, wake up  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the biggies  Now, someone is going to die  When you listen to me  Listen to me, die  Listen to me, die  Hey, what's up, Ralphie?  Ralphie Mae back in studio  Yeah  Joey Diaz back in studio.  Travis back in studio.  I need coffee.  Bill needs coffee.  Who else needs coffee?  I got one. 
[01:44:00]  How many times do you go to Starbucks a day, Travis?  We were talking about that yesterday.  Be honest.  Five or six times.  Yesterday went about nine times.  Nine times.  To Starbucks, Anthony, in a four-hour show.  Because we all want our coffee at different times.  We're such asses.  You went twice.  I told...  When?  You know what?  We talk about Starbucks every day.  And I told Washington.  Starbucks is a big sponsor of XM Satellite Radio.  I'm like, will you just give us a machine?  We're talking about it every day.  They're getting a nice ad every day for Starbucks.  Or Star-buck-ses-ses. 
[01:44:30]  What's up, guys?  You look all beat up.  Ralphie, you all right?  Yeah, man.  I'm living the dream.  Ralphie Mae.  I'm living the dream.  Ralphie Mae played Caroline's last night.  It went well?  Yeah, it was good.  It was good.  Fun show.  Ralphie Mae's at Caroline's all weekend long.  I don't even know if there are tickets available.  So if you're planning on coming to the city and checking out Ralphie Mae and Caroline's,  you better...  Call.  212-757-4100.  And Joey Diaz in studio as well.  How are you, buddy?  See?  You passed the audition. 
[01:45:00]  Now you get your own mic today.  Yeah, thanks for having me.  Yesterday, you had to share one with Ralphie.  No, we just ran out of mics because of Ant's mic problem.  Yeah.  At least my mic's fixed.  That's all I ever care about.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good.  I know.  It sounds all good now.  Yeah.  It's perfect.  That's how it should sound, right?  Exactly.  All right.  We got about...  Hot girls.  We got hot girls.  Not so hot girls.  I wouldn't have been going to be honest.  Why? 
[01:45:30]  And everything in between.  Jimmy, what's wrong?  Come on.  Just explain.  I love when I make you feel uncomfortable.  So just explain it.  Just hot girls.  Not so hot girls.  And they're right outside of the studio.  It was at the time there was a girl standing outside.  And we all looked at her.  And Ope goes, hey, who's the fat pig outside the studio?  Oh, I know.  Oh, it's that bad.  We're not watching a TV show.  She's right there.  And 15 seconds later, you just see a hurt look on her face.  Yeah, because I thought...  Yeah, that's what we got to explain. 
[01:46:00]  You know, it's one thing just to say this stuff to their friends, but they get to hear too.  And there's a satellite bounce delay.  They're actually hearing the feed out there that people hear at home, which is not a delay  that we put in.  It's just a feed delay.  Yeah.  I got to tell you, when Anthony and I were doing commercial radio, we got away with that  all the time because the show would run and that was it.  Yeah.  We didn't have replays and, you know, only the really good segments would ever be replayed  again on, you know, when we're on vacation.  Yeah.  But man, I get email all the time from people we trash because, you know, they didn't hear 
[01:46:30]  us trashing them for whatever reason.  Then they go home and they're all excited to hear their appearance on the show, so they  got the XM and they listen to the replay.  Then they hear all the bad shit we say about them, maybe even after their appearance.  And then the horrendous emails come in.  How dare you?  We're never coming back on the show again.  What?  Get over it.  Pretty soon you're going to be the only option.  They'll have to come back.  Who's breathing like a T-Rex on the window in Jurassic Park? 
[01:47:00]  I got sleep apnea and...  Do you really have sleep apnea?  Yeah, I got sleep apnea.  Oh, you do?  With the machine, it's a nightmare.  Oh, you got one of those machines?  Yeah, I got the machine and stuff.  What the hell is the machine?  Huh?  How does that work for you?  You know, if it don't break, because I'm like a gorilla with a mask on, so I break it and  then I can't, you know, you can't sleep, you get headaches, so I machine it.  Like last night I tie a shoelace around my head like a goddamn mummy or something, like  a swami, you know what I'm saying?  The back of my neck is sore.  Like the blue gin.  I feel like Jesus on Sunday, you know what I'm saying?  The back of my neck is sore because the rope goes into your neck. 
[01:47:30]  My father used to one of them.  It's like one of those things you put over your face and you put a tube in your mouth and it  kind of pushes air in to make sure that your air flows.  60,000 fucking gallons a minute, you know, just coming to your lungs so your throat don't  close.  Do you get a better night of sleep?  Oh, you fucking sleep like a baby.  Really?  You're rested.  Yeah, it's great.  Go down there and get to sleep.  Well, you're a light guy, so now they have this thing that you stick to three tubes in  your throat.  You're in by seven, out by one in the afternoon.  That is an implant. 
[01:48:00]  What they would do sometimes is they would cut a little area in your throat and when it  would heal, they were hoping the scar tissue would keep it from closing and now there's  these three things they insert.  Right.  I had one ENT tell me that that could cause an infection because it's a foreign body  in your system.  I don't know if that's true enough.  Listen, after all the pussy you've eaten, that's the hook and the hook and the hook.  Now, what do you give a fuck about?  That always comes up with Jimmy.  No matter what he's trying to do, they always bring up, well, you're with dirty whores.  I don't mind a foreign law.  I'm the same boat as you.  I'm not putting you down.  It builds up your immunity.  You know what I mean?  He's got whore antibodies floating in there. 
[01:48:30]  He gets mad when someone hands him a spoon or a fork, you know, holding the end that you  eat with.  Yeah, look, there's some on it.  It just drives me nuts.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  You know, I was scratching my nuts.  I give you a fork.  Yeah, you don't want that.  Yeah, but he'll eat, you know, some transvestites in.  So, I mean, why?  What's going on over there?  I don't know.  I have a big caboose.  Nice.  She's smoking.  She's smoking.  I'm not wrong with transvestites.  They cook, they clean.  You can beat on them once in a while, right?  Who are they going to tell?  You know what I'm saying?  Fuck them.  It's a party. 
[01:49:00]  It's a party.  Me or some dude with a wig and a black eye.  You know what I'm talking about?  Fuck it.  You might as well have a good time.  Science.  Drop it out of Joe D.  Oh, man.  Last night, Joe D is like a spider.  It was a carantula.  You know, when I smoke dope, I fuck up my words.  I'm originally from Cuba.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Look at that little muffler.  I like it.  You got to see this in the studio.  Now you're talking to me.  Come on in and do that more.  Speak to me, oh, toothless one. 
[01:49:30]  That's a one.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Babaloo.  Well, there's obviously girls out the window, and they're pounding their asses against it.  Fantastic.  Very nice.  That really taps into a nice place inside, doesn't it?  Yeah.  That's better than oatmeal.  All right, let's go to the phones real fast.  Good for you.  Chris, what's up?  Go ahead, Chris.  How are you doing?  I was following celebrity weight loss, and I went to ask Ralphie after the show that he could  continue to lose weight, or is he just, you know, big again?  Dude, dude, I was big when I started the show. 
[01:50:00]  I was big after the show.  I was big in the show.  I've kept all that weight off, and I've lost more.  I'm just slowing down on it.  I'm not going as crazy as I was, because I can't keep it up with my schedule.  Did you get a lot of chicks, bro?  Bro, I used to get way more than what I should, but I've got a hot chick right now.  I'm getting married in July, so I'm kind of off the market.  You know what I'm saying?  I like to practice a catch and release program.  Ralphie's got...  The hottest chick, man.  And she's sweet.  Yeah, she's nice, girl.  Oh, that girl that they showed on the show once? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, Ralphie's been with her for years.  He said she found a penny stuck to you once?  Yeah, right.  That's true.  Actually, that one's not true.  She also says that she found a Cheeto under my titty, and that's never true.  I mean, you would never keep Cheetos on your titties due to the humidity.  They would go stale quite fast.  I mean, let's be honest.  That would be cool, man.  Like, I'm a professional.  I don't let Cheetos get away from me.  All right, let's go to Lenny in New York.  Lenny!  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How's it going?  And, Joey, were you the one that was running in the longest yard that when you were running, 
[01:51:00]  you actually fell on the floor, and your belly was going up and down?  That's me, baby.  That's me.  Oh, dude.  That scene was hilarious.  That's right, baby.  That shit's hilarious.  That shit's hilarious.  That shit's hilarious.  Oh, shit, man.  Talking about the longest yard, obviously.  The longest yard.  Yeah, that movie.  Guys, I know Greg joked on it, but it is a funny movie, especially with Joe.  Dude, it's a very funny movie.  It's a funny movie.  You know, we did trash it.  Did you see it?  Hold on.  Without even seeing it, which is probably not bad.  Hey, listen.  Remakes are tough, bro. 
[01:51:30]  Adam Sandler did a good job.  He did.  Well, now I'm going to have to check it out.  Yeah, you're going to have to check it out.  Now that I know someone in the movie, I've got to check it out.  He's good.  Yeah, it was a very good movie.  I'm really proud of it, how it came out.  I'm the fat fuck in the movie.  I fall, you know.  I'm naked.  Do you wear belly shirts and stuff?  Fuck belly shirts.  I'm all, you know me.  I've got nothing to hide, brother.  You know what I'm saying?  Clothes.  Cuban egg rolls out.  Right.  If I dress black, I'm still fat.  You know what I'm saying?  Right, right.  People draw.  I'm dressing black.  I look thin.  Stripes ain't thinning.  I can fucking put, you know, I can dress in hell color, and I'm still going to be big. 
[01:52:00]  So, fan dick from a whack bag wants to put Joey in the Darth Vader mask.  Does he really?  Yeah, because you're breathing.  He wants to get the Darth Vader sound.  No, I'll put the mask on him and give him a little stabbing.  Right there.  We'll invite Norton over to cheerlead.  Maybe we'll get your buddy to come with the Rolls Royce.  Dumb boss.  Dumb boss.  That pussy, some fucking 80-year-old guy in Florida is punking him for his money.  Totally.  He won't get that back.  No, he won't.  He can't get that money back.  Hey, pal said they're going to help.  Good luck, stupid. 
[01:52:30]  He's been taken.  Yeah.  See you, unconnected idiots.  Taken for a ride in that awful car.  Trying to buy class.  Low monthly installments.  Yeah, for $26,000.  So, when are the girls coming in?  What are the girls going in today, mister?  Well, there's going to be some hypnotism going on.  By the blue gin.  Hold on.  Someone's calling me out on something.  What's the matter, pumpkin?  Sean, what's up?  Hey, best line ever was when you said,  Ralphie Mae underwater in a swimming pool looked like a human lava lamp.  Oh, yeah, I did say that. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, that's true.  I'm sorry.  Hey, dude, it's true.  Hey, ain't nobody more embarrassed than me.  I hope you can't do nothing to hurt my feelings on that one.  I was real brave going on the phone.  He's like, I know I never trashed Ralphie.  He's a friend of ours.  Oh, yeah, I did say that.  Yeah, but that's funny, though, dude.  You're absolutely right.  I don't care.  Yeah, the pool shot was like, wow.  Dude, I knew it was brutal when it was happening.  No one looks good underwater.  Ever.  No one.  Ever.  Ever.  Even like skinny chicks can look kind of weird.  Yeah.  When you take a big, fat guy, it doesn't look good at all.  I mean, it's like, wow, where's the tusk there, walrus? 
[01:53:30]  That's all that was missing.  A human lava lamp, though.  Nice.  I did have that kind of a flowy thing going.  Yeah, become one with the water itself.  Become one with the water.  Melting into it.  What are we going to do with the hypnotist?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Why don't we get him in and get the process going here?  He looks like the blue gin.  Remember that guy from the, you know, he threw that guy?  Sorry.  Oh, you got your star, Bucky Poo? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, wait for that little coffee?  I'm just going to call it coffee now.  Oh, yeah?  That's right.  Waiting for our Joe.  Until this coffee outlet gives us free coffee.  I can't believe they're even doing this.  What's the job?  Bill needs sugar.  Bill needs a machine here or something.  We tried.  Where are the mics?  We need another mic, don't we?  I don't know how.  Are they stretching a mic cord from another studio?  Yeah.  We're going to take this one and stretch it into the other room.  Oh, I thought you were taking a mic from somewhere else.  There's a studio over there.  Why can't they just yank it out of there? 
[01:54:30]  Hey, the girls over there are pussies.  There's no way we can ever have more than five microphones on this show.  That's exactly it.  That's my girl.  I like that one in the red.  That's exactly it.  Dude, I'm telling you, she's a filthy animal.  I like the one in the red.  All right, you know what?  Just bring everybody in.  There's another 20 people outside of the studio.  Just bring everyone in and somehow make this work.  Look at this.  Can't we ever just...  All hands will be above the desk.  Above the console today, Rob?  Yes.  You want them all above?  Unless otherwise placed by the participants. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  This is our little stage.  No two thumbs up reviews of any of the girls today?  Hey, if it goes there, it goes there.  I'm just practicing a bit.  I'll give them a little look for change in the payphone.  All right?  With a combo of cigarette machines.  The little cigarette machine.  You pull the handle of the cigarette machine.  There's the red dragon.  There's the red dragon.  Come on over here with Uncle Joey.  Really fast.  Ralphie, let me see your nails before we continue with the program.  They're all clipped and nice.  Yes, sir.  Nicey, nice.  Close enough. 
[01:55:30]  Nicey, nice.  This is the red dragon right there.  I love it to death.  She's called the red dragon?  Yeah, this is it, baby.  This is good as it gets, baby.  Is your name the red dragon?  That's her code name.  Yeah?  Yes, it's the red dragon.  This is as good as it gets.  Very hot brunette.  Very, very nice.  Jewish or Puerto Rican?  Arabic.  Oh, shit.  A terrorist, you know what I'm saying?  The swami with salami.  I like it.  You know what I'm talking about?  Chatees is going to battle Taliban.  I'm going to pull the strings.  He's going to blow up with me in the lap.  Kaboom!  Her dildo has a fucking fuse on. 
[01:56:00]  Is it really?  Look at her.  You're a fucking animal, Arabiki.  All right.  Arabiki.  That's my girl, you know what I'm saying?  The Arabic strippers now enjoy Diaz's lap.  Who else we got?  We got, like, so many people.  Where do we go?  Steve, why don't you take control?  This is your mess.  There's some lovely gals here.  This is your mess.  I know.  Only Steve could, like, figure out how to get us free breakfast, wacky porn, and a hypnotist.  That's a me already.  Good thing you didn't spread this out over a week.  Book them all in one day.  We haven't had a guest in two weeks. 
[01:56:30]  80 people are in today.  We also have a tennis team coming in.  Know why?  Because, like, these guys are doing their job behind the scenes, and they're sending Ant and  I email all the time with suggestions for...  Yeah, what do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?  I finally gave up on this.  I say yes to everything now, and this is what happens.  I hit delete.  You get 30 people that show up for one show.  Well, we fire off ideas.  Well, what do you think about hypnotists?  What do you think about strippers?  What do you think about breakfast strippers, hypnotists?  Yes, yes, yes.  All right, go. 
[01:57:00]  Select, select, select, delete.  That's what I do to those emails.  Yeah, I know.  Or Anthony's response is usually, ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Or all Photoshop pictures you send me.  Yeah, all those.  He sends suggestions.  One suggestion he sent, it was a picture.  Some artist drew a picture of me in Opie.  And it's to be used for something.  I don't know, maybe some, I'm not even quite sure what it is.  But he sends it, he goes, look, I know, Anthony, I know your image, this is way off, but, you know, Opie's is pretty close. 
[01:57:30]  The guy's going to work on it some more.  I just want your input.  What do you think so far?  So I put it in Photoshop and got a bunch of ink spots, because it was done in, like, black ink drawing.  It was just one color.  And I made it look like I had just thrown ink all over the drawing and sent it back to Steve.  I go, here, I fixed it.  Yeah, it looked like a bird shit on it.  I don't even give him answers.  These are the Bag of Nuts guys.  These guys are the ones with the Wacky Porno, and they also helped us provide the girls.  Yeah, we're the Wacky Porn guys that you guys were talking about. 
[01:58:00]  You're in the Wacky Porno?  Yeah, I'm actually Yankee Doodle.  Yankee Doodle.  Oh, my God, the Yankee Doodle?  I'm the Yankee Doodle.  I've got to ask you, seriously, is that his stage name?  No, my mother, Mrs. Doodle.  That doesn't sound right, man.  I mean, let me, you know, you guys, you know, I mean, listen, we're all aware of what people are watching porn for.  Nobody's watching it for us to be funny.  But if somebody's going to say, hey, come out to Los Angeles, we'll give you $30,000 to watch girls take it up the ass.  I think, I'm in. 
[01:58:30]  Book that flight.  That's basically what happened.  We've got double penetration going on there.  I mean, we were in charge of this, man.  Really?  Yeah.  How the hell did that happen?  I don't know.  I'm a comic.  You know, I've been doing clubs.  We met this dude, Mickey G.  He's a big-time porno guy that, like, he's the guy that, like, you don't know him, but when you see him, you're like, I know that fucking guy, Mickey G.  Really?  You know, so I recognized him for many years of illegal cable in my house and went up to him at this party, just started talking.  And next thing you know, double penetration. 
[01:59:00]  It's so easy to get into porno, isn't it?  Well, you know what?  You just got to meet a porno guy, and you're in.  You talk to him for five minutes, and, hey, you want to come out and give him a half-assed script, and they're like, wow, that's brilliant, you know?  Yes.  We were called brilliant.  Brilliant.  These guys were called brilliant.  We were called brilliant.  This script is brilliant.  I was dressed up like a chick, and they called us brilliant.  Brilliant.  Yeah.  It was just terrible.  Look at Norton.  What's the whole premise of you guys being in the movie? 
[01:59:30]  What I did as Yankee Doodle was bring in the bed for every scene.  I wore a fucking top hat with a pink feather in it, and an Uncle Sam outfit, and they'd go, all right, bring in the bed.  And I'd go, and I would fucking bring in the bed and go, there you go.  And they would fucking hit it.  Did you do any fucking?  Oh, no, my mother would not.  So you were just the prop guy.  Yeah, and I was bachelor number three in the mating game skit. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, so you didn't get picked.  No, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mickey G got picked.  Because the guy that gets picked does the fucking.  Does the fucking.  You're just bringing the bed.  I'm just writing the script, man.  I'm the brilliance behind you.  It's great.  We're all ugly comics, you know.  No one really wants to see us.  I'm Jewish.  My dick doesn't really belong in porn, you know.  Joe's got the little fat guy dick.  It wasn't really going to work.  They brought in.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon with Good Will Hunting.  Yeah, man.  Good Will Cunting.  That's our next script. 
[02:00:30]  Of course it is.  Project Red Light.  Exactly.  Project Red Light.  I like these guys.  All right, man.  That's pretty good.  It was fun.  I mean, we have a couple more scripts.  And if any of these companies are fucking stupid enough to, like, you know, say, hey,  come on back to L.A., you know, we'll go.  I mean, I got to watch girls walk into, like, these porno parties.  And I'm just like, I've jerked off to her.  Oh, my God.  I know her.  I was.  Yeah.  You've been on sets.  Jimmy's like that.  I was starstruck for the first time.  This is the second time in my life I'm starstruck.  The first time was from boobs and vagina, you know? 
[02:01:00]  Great.  I got to ask you a question, though.  What does a porn script look like?  There's, like, page one, fade in, cock entering vagina.  End credits.  We didn't write any of the sex part.  We just wrote, like, the wacky dialogue, you know, for the first, you know, up until  the sex part.  The storyboard is one card.  I mean, we're not even.  We're not.  A dick and a pussy.  The Washington Monument.  All right.  With an arrow going in and out.  Repeat.  And let me tell you something.  These chicks, like, we were at this porn party, and this girl's walking up to us, and 
[02:01:30]  Matt's like, hey, April Flower.  And she goes, no.  Flower.  From Seymour Productions.  You know me.  I specialize in gapping, fisting, and anal.  And I'm like, what the fuck is gapping?  Gapping?  You know what gapping is?  Gap your plugs?  No, no, no.  Gaping.  Gaping.  Not gapping.  Well, she said gapping.  That shows how smart she was.  Gaping?  Yes, gaping.  Oh, well, that's different.  Well, what the fuck is that?  When the asshole opens up.  When the asshole opens up.  They put their legs behind her head, and she plays with her back end for a while until 
[02:02:00]  she can throw shit in it, you know?  It's just this big.  Oh, the ass cave.  It really is.  I mean, it looks like Ed Norton could fall into it, you know?  Like a sinkhole.  There's a five-year-old trapped in a sinkhole.  And I'm just like, she's giving it to us.  The whole town gathers to pull them out.  She's delivering a crying father by her thighs.  Like she's giving us her resume.  I'm like, yeah, let her make it call you any day.  Big, big hole.  But let's be, you know, another thing, too.  It's like, you know, we, like I said, you know, we're fucking broke comics, you know, 
[02:02:30]  and from the New York area, they said, come out to Los Angeles.  I literally bought a $100 van, drove across with this guy sleeping in it, and the next  night, because I'm on a fucking porn set, I'm on an 85-foot yacht with, you know, chicks  licking each other and gapping and fucking fisting.  Gapping, gaping.  And, you know, and, like, you know, I don't know who's into what, but, you know, softballs  of Coke and, you know, and weed and vaporizers to smoke the weed without burning your lungs  and whatever else, you know what I mean?  Fuck it, dude, I'm in. 
[02:03:00]  You know what I'm saying?  But we were so broke.  We were, like, eating fucking, like, we ate this thing called Freezer Queen from 99 Cent's.  99 Cent's, or it was rib-shaped meat or some shit like that.  Rib-shaped patties.  That's like the McRib from McDonald's.  They just stamp it out, and it's like a slab of just processed whatever, but they have  to stamp it so it looks like there's an actual bone that was in there and looks like ribs.  But try living on that for a month.  That's how healthy we are right now.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  Burritos and stuff. 
[02:03:30]  We're in a van, I'm sorry.  Go, go, go.  We're in a van, and the next night we're on a yacht, and it's like, you know, we've got  to fucking save money and shit, you know.  We would go to the 99 Cent's store, eat the rib-shaped patties, man, for about seven months  I did that, dude.  Rib-shaped patties and fucking corn.  Well, we were all broke.  Now there's gaping and coke as we sailed away on the porno.  You had a story there, you and your boat, your porn boat. 
[02:04:00]  Wow, all right, so you brought the ladies in.  We brought the ladies.  Yeah.  When you do porno, you have to bring chicks in.  Of course you do.  It's very rare you want guys from porn just to talk.  Yeah, not the guy that brings the bed.  You don't want that?  You want the chicks that are fucking on.  Dude, seriously, what's the bed heavy?  Go.  That was our improv, right?  Yeah, you're a bed holder.  Go, you know.  That's what it was.  Yeah, well, these girls are lovely.  I'll say.  And who are they?  What's your name?  Brittany.  You're Brittany, of course you are. 
[02:04:30]  Of course you are.  Yeah.  And ladies, you are?  My name is Mallory.  You're Mallory and you're what?  Lauren.  Lauren.  Very beautiful girls here.  And you're in that.  Are you in that?  Where's the cover of that?  Are you in this?  No, none of us are.  Yeah, these girls are the local girls, right, from Jersey?  South Amboy.  Huh?  South Amboy, I think.  South Amboy?  Yeah.  Brittany was looking at me.  Do y'all do porn?  I think she likes me.  You don't do porn?  No porno?  No, not at all.  Oh, not at all.  Oh, not at all.  Damn it. 
[02:05:00]  Sorry, I touched your heart.  You want to?  Could you?  Boats and coke and gaping, whatever you need.  Yeah, right?  What do you girls do?  Grab the mic and like, yeah.  You're dancers.  You're dancers.  Oh, yes.  I like dancers, too.  Nice.  Sure.  Sure.  Dance in Jersey.  Got her clothes for money.  That's good.  That's a noble occupation.  You guys, are you full nude or is there liquor served?  We had to go to school for it, though.  Yeah.  Actually, the place we're currently working at now, no.  No what?  No nudity.  No nudity?  You got to keep your...  A lot of fun.  Booty shaking.  You got to keep tops on, or? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  Are you serious?  Are you serious?  What are you dancing?  The PTA?  And dudes pay that?  They pay to go there?  Chuck E. Cheese?  Really?  Wow.  I think it's hilarious, because you know what?  It's just like dancing on the beach.  Wow.  You paid ten bucks for a bottle of beer at the beach.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You don't try to go in with silk sweatpants and no underwear at the beach.  Leaking clear stuff when you walk out of the beach.  Sorry, my shoes are full.  Squish, squish, squish, squish. 
[02:06:00]  So you dance.  You ever dance naked, though, somewhere else?  I dance topless.  Topless?  Yeah.  No bottomless, though?  No.  Would you?  Would you?  I don't knock it.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  That's something I personally prefer.  No?  No?  It's things guys prefer, though, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  There's something about a naked girl dancing.  Yeah, you'd be surprised how men really do enjoy that.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Topless, good.  Yeah.  But bottomless?  Better.  Even better.  Not nice.  Yeah, that's a good one.  This one's a player. 
[02:06:30]  Like this one.  Yeah?  Britney.  You Britney?  Bottomless?  Yeah.  No.  No?  Yes or no?  Maybe.  It's not something you're dancing and all of a sudden go, shit, my pants are off.  I thought I liked this.  It happens.  It happens.  Yeah.  It used to happen.  Out of Long Island in the old days, they used to get away with everything.  They'd start by pulling it aside a little bit, and then after, you know, they're on  stage for a couple hours, and you're throwing up some real money, that just comes off.  Fuck the law.  We got a fan of the porn guys.  Dennis in Jersey. 
[02:07:00]  Go ahead, Dennis.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan of the Baggin' Nuts comedy team.  I bought the Reality Sucks DVD at the Bargain Basement comedy show at 88 Keys.  Good plug.  Oh, it was great.  Was he the producer of this fucking guy?  You think we're stupid, you idiot?  He's a shit dick, Dennis.  Is this the Baggin' Nuts guy that overslept today?  No.  If you guys remember, you guys, when Norton did his HBO special, remember the kid who  yelled out, shit dick?  Of course.  That's shit dick, Dennis.  Oh, you're the guy that yelled before they had to get... 
[02:07:30]  Oh, he's gone.  I was watching the tape when I got home, and you can hear somebody yell, shit dick, and  then Drew Frazier has to go, oh, you can't heckle and yell.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't yell.  He is such an idiot when it comes to Jimmy.  The kid is like...  He's our fan, man.  He's 6'2", he weighs about 250 pounds, and if you even mention Jimmy Norton, he turns  into like a friggin' third grader at like a Britney Spears concert.  He's an absolute...  He's the kid that said he saw you 16 times.  Yeah, he's...  Wow.  He's the way you are with Ozzy, that's the way he is with you.  Oh, that's healthy. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  I'm a rock legend.  I lived at home until I was 30.  All right, also we have the hypnotist in here.  Sir.  How you doing?  Hi.  Good.  What's your name?  My name is Salish.  Salish.  Yes.  Yes.  I like...  He's got the whole look, too.  He's got the shaved head, he's got the earrings, and you look like a hypnotist.  I must say.  Or that, or a bill collector, one or the other.  Or a genie.  Or a genie. 
[02:08:30]  Or a genie.  Heard that, probably.  You're getting sleepy.  No, Jim.  Yes.  Are you feeling sleepy?  Not really.  What'd you say, motherfucker?  All right, I'm a little tired.  Shush, shush, shush.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  All right, what do you want to do today?  You've been hypnotizing people for how long?  I've been hypnotizing people for about 14 years on stage for about 10.  14 years?  So before that you did it with what?  Like quit smoking or something like that?  Or then you...  No, actually I started off as one of those dirty, uncensored hypnotists, 
[02:09:00]  and then I started helping people with problems.  But then you said on stage for 10 years, but you've been hypnotizing for 14.  What was that?  Well, just learning how to do it.  To get sex at dorms?  I'm in front of the parties.  You're sucking my cock.  He considered it hypnosis, but it was really a hammer.  You're getting sleepy, crack.  And you wake up with a headache.  This is the cock you're looking for.  Wonderful. 
[02:09:30]  So 14 years, and you do it on stage?  I do it on stage.  And what do you do?  What's a typical night of hypnotizing people on stage?  Anything from thinking that I'm on the Jerry Springer show,  to having Tourette's, to making love to their chair,  having orgasms on stage?  I am one of the biggest skeptics of hypnotism there are in the world.  I've heard that.  I just don't buy it.  It's what you do, and that's fine, 
[02:10:00]  and I don't want you to go medieval on my ass.  Very appropriate.  You ever hear that?  You kind of look like myself.  Yeah, I've heard that, yeah.  Mosses, mosses.  You kind of look like that motherfucker.  Well, you're going to hypnotize the girls?  Whoever wants to be hypnotized, we'll...  We've got a couple girls here.  Yeah, two out of the three raised their hands.  Who makes a good candidate for hypnotism?  Well, first of all, someone that's willing to do it.  Willing.  Willing.  Being open-minded.  Open-minded.  Sucker.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  And, of course, great tits help, too.  Well, we've got a bunch of winners here.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, look at that.  She's showing.  That's lovely.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're not in Jersey anymore.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Joey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's thoughtless here.  We ain't weehawking.  You know what I'm saying?  Let's do it.  That's great.  So, these girls would be good candidates?  Do you open-minded?  Yeah, open-minded.  Extremely open-minded.  Yeah?  Really?  Are you into being here?  Yeah, I am. 
[02:11:00]  You sure?  Yeah.  Okay.  She's just got one of those...  I'm just being honest.  She's got one of those dancer attitudes.  Yes.  It's good to have.  But it's like...  No, no, it's not a bad...  I'm not saying bad attitude.  Yeah, we're not saying one of the dancer attitudes.  It's like the whole head, the whole attitude, the dancer attitude is, fucking guys.  It's just like, you fucking guys.  Just give me your money and shut the fuck up.  And I know you're all a bunch of saps and stuff.  That's cool, you know.  No?  Really? 
[02:11:30]  No?  Never.  You do a lot of talking when you dance?  I actually enjoy my job.  No, no, that's...  I'm not saying you don't.  I think you're misunderstanding me.  Yeah, what's the matter?  I don't like the tension.  I kind of have like a crush on her.  You do?  Yeah.  Where are you from?  Where are you from?  Me too.  Where do you go to school?  All right, listen.  We're in Jersey.  Huh?  I'm doing good.  God, I'm like a fucking zero.  All right, why don't we get the girls hypnotized?  Why don't we get the girls hypnotized?  Let's see what we can come up with, okay?  Yes.  All right.  Do you need a quiet place to go? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, we're going to go to a quiet place and see whoever wants to volunteer.  Maybe some of these guys, they'll give it a try.  You're going to hold off?  How many more people do you need?  It doesn't matter.  Whoever wants to come, we'll come.  Can we get Danny or Nathaniel or Travis?  If they're open-minded.  If they're open-minded.  That dumb Danny, yeah, of course he'll do it.  Absolutely.  Very impressionable.  Of course he is.  Danny does anything.  Yeah.  He's the greatest.  He'll do it.  Nathaniel, he picks and chooses, but Danny...  Nathaniel's gotten very cocky since he's assault on the media. 
[02:12:30]  Danny still is a go-getter.  Yeah, Danny's hungry.  I like this kid.  Nice body.  What about Travis?  Is Travis in or out?  He doesn't mind.  What is that?  That's what he just said?  He doesn't mind.  What does that mean?  I don't buy it.  You read Travis?  No, he's not very open-minded.  Yeah, he just shook his head back and forth.  Oh, I thought he said he didn't mind.  That didn't look good.  Sorry.  That didn't look good from where I said.  Hypnotize him.  You know what you do?  Hypnotize him and then tell him to go get coffee.  And that'll make you look real good because he'll go and do it.  Even though he doesn't believe.  He does? 
[02:13:00]  I know.  He does it.  That's the whole gag.  I know, sir.  I know.  It bombed horribly.  That's how bad that was.  Dummy actually jumped in.  Well, technically I do.  I get coffee, so that would be silly.  Yes, it would, Travis.  All right, why don't we get this going?  Where are you going?  Quiet.  I'm going to put him in my production room because it's soundproof.  If you have like a stopwatch you use, remember, Jim Norton's a toilet.  Jim Norton's a toilet.  You've been stopped up for days. 
[02:13:30]  All right.  And the Bag O' Nuts guys, you guys hanging?  Sure.  All right.  The website is bagonuts.com.  bagonuts.com.  Great.  Okay, girls, we'll see you soon.  Go do your thing, Lauren.  Bye, Lauren.  Maybe I'll hypnotize you to take the little shorts off, you animal.  You stay in Pakistan.  You're here with Uncle Joey for the afternoon.  She's got to go, sir.  She's got to go.  Put Lauren with Uncle Joey.  Nice.  All right, girl.  But she's got to...  I'll be back.  You married? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Loosen up a little.  Yeah, loosen up a little.  You want a shot?  Are you nervous?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Really?  Why are you nervous?  I thought she was being mean.  Get the Jaeger.  Yeah, we got rid of the Jaeger machine.  Get the Jaeger.  No, we're not on anymore.  We're waiting to come back from break.  No, you know what it is?  It's just like, I never did anything like that.  It's just like being on the spot.  Really?  I don't know.  Eh, don't sweat it.  Don't sweat it.  We're easy to get along with.  You came in here with an attitude, but it seems like you're a nice person, so we just  want to make sure you're comfortable in here, you know?  Okay.  I didn't see it as an attitude, not like a bad attitude. 
[02:14:30]  Well, it's just, you know.  It was just how she was presenting herself.  Her arms were folded.  That's always a bad sign, you know, like someone that's being very cautious or someone  that's tense.  Or a stripper doesn't take off any clothes.  No, I did.  I think it's...  I've worked a tenth.  Oh, okay.  For a year, actually.  Oh, yeah?  It's not like I'm uncomfortable, but it's just like...  You're shy?  Yeah.  By the way, you're so much hotter than the other two.  Don't say that on the air, though.  Don't say that on the air.  Yeah.  Just to let you know.  Who's this psychopath? 
[02:15:00]  This is George.  He's our bouncer.  Oh, George is funny.  You're a bouncer?  Yeah, anyone that walks around with a G.G. Allen shirt means business.  I'll tell you right now.  Melinda was supposed to come.  Yeah.  What happened to her?  Yeah, she's still sleeping.  Oh.  Yeah.  Too much coke last night, probably?  No.  It's just...  No coke?  The hours that you work, it's like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can relate to that.  Too much as a good golf guy, your bosses.  You have to kick ass a lot, sir?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I thought it was like so... 
[02:15:30]  Once in a while, you've got to rack some head.  Some guy who wants to touch.  It's so...  That's a good part of my job.  It just stinks, though, when you can't touch.  You know?  You want to just...  It does.  You want to just reach up and grab a handful of snatch.  Jesus.  Yeah, right?  Pomp it.  Just palm it like you're judging tomatoes.  Nice.  Nice.  That's a ripe tomato.  I'm such a loser.  I was trying to get the...  What's her name?  Brittany?  To...  To...  I'm too shy to even ask her to sit on my lap. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  And she's like...  I'm just a fucking...  She wanted no part of you.  I never go to strip clubs.  Never.  You don't?  Really?  Absolutely not.  No.  It's a waste of money, right?  No, I'm not saying that.  I just don't go.  He wants the whole fucking caboodle.  I know.  I know.  He's a filthy animal.  He can't stop halfway.  Huh?  Who's weird?  Jersey.  Like the way that they do...  Yeah.  Do you like the other girls or...  You like the other two that are here?  And I like them?  Yeah.  What do you mean parents do?  You don't like them?  Hmm?  Do you know those two girls?  Yeah.  Oh, you know?  Yeah.  We all actually work at this one club. 
[02:16:30]  Oh.  Okay.  What do you think's hotter?  There's a variety of people.  Miss?  What do you think's hotter?  Are you bisexual?  I like to ask creepy questions.  No...  No...  Prefer...  What?  Prefer male?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me get it like this.  Prefer penis.  Yeah.  Say that for the air.  That'll be good.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's what we need.  Yeah.  You know every girl is...  A little bit.  They deny it or not, they are.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Like the girls a little bit.  Not bisexual.  Like, you know what I mean?  They're just...  They just like, you know, they're open to it.  In the right circumstance.  Especially the dancers.  Yeah.  Well, you girls are always all over each other at the club and everything.  You see them at the strip club.  One girl's getting off, one's getting on.  They're, you know, touch each other.  It's all hot.  I do that with Jimmy after the show.  Yeah, just a couple of men.  Yeah, a little touch in the bathroom or something like that.  In the manly way.  It's fun acting.  Yeah, why not?  Are you getting more relaxed? 
[02:17:30]  All right, she's getting more relaxed.  Yeah, you know what it is?  It's just talking and just...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talking.  Just sit here for four hours a day and just talk.  Yeah, normal conversation.  Yeah, I know.  When you're just coming in, you don't know people and you don't know what to expect.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And you figure radio, it's got to be some kind of, you know, scripted thing.  Yeah, it's just hanging out and talking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're pretty easy to get along with.  Yeah.  Well, we've got to step aside so they can, like, wire the studio, I guess.  Oh, is that what they're doing?  We should be back from breaking a couple of minutes.  What a long break this has been.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[02:18:00]  We never even take breaks, usually.  And, I don't know, we could run commercials, I guess.  Yeah.  All the sponsors we have for the show.  Yeah.  Tons of them.  It's a very popular program.  Starbuckses.  Starbuckseses.  I got a base.  How old do you want?  All right.  Well, I guess we'll have the girls in here in a few minutes to, you know, see what that  guy can do with them.  The hypnotist, so.  She's 19, by the way.  God in heaven.  Love you.  10 years ago.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[02:18:30]  What happened?  I don't know what's going on.  Out to lunch, where you're smashing that awful Frida, because that bitch stinks, and  she's not funny.  Stop wrecking your fucking mediocre radio show by letting her call in.  So, out to lunch is the guys in Baltimore, I think?  Yeah.  Okay.  The syndicates of JFK and DC.  And they're big fans of our show.  Yeah, they love you guys.  They hand out stickers for your radio.  That's so weird.  That's like the lowest self-esteem radio guys.  Let's hand out stickers for them.  Why don't you promote your own show? 
[02:19:00]  I know.  The guy has this enormous head, so I'm surprised he even goes out in public.  But they're fucking big fans.  And, you know, we're on there, so I'm fucking trash.  You know why they're not fucking funny?  Because they won't have comics in.  Because comics will outshine them.  And if they were funny and secure like you guys are, right?  And lazy.  You're lazy, too.  This way you get comics.  You know, you're just too lazy.  You're lazy a lot.  Fucking zero.  All right?  We were just watching the clock waiting for you to come in knowing that we'd get a good  hour.  And I could just sit here, you know. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  And so they won't have comics in.  So now they're...  You had to hear them and go, oh, you want a war against...  You know, they're blaming these kids.  These kids didn't do it.  I didn't.  All right?  I'll take a war with you fucking idiots.  All right?  What are you going to do?  You're going to keep me off the TV?  So they go after these kids, right?  And they go, oh, you want a war?  And we're listening to them on not one funny line in 40 minutes.  How about the...  Here's a war.  You're a fat fuck.  Your wife is unfunny.  And your breath stinks.  I said that.  Jim Norton and Rich Voss agree. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, I agree.  Here's a war.  Why don't you have a war on weight, you fucking buffet molester?  All right?  Stop eating.  You've been kicked out of every major market.  You fucking can't make it.  You're sucked in New York.  You're sucked in Philly.  You got booted out of Buffalo.  How's that?  The guys from out to lunch are not saying this, although I'm sure they agree with it.  Oh, I thought you were talking about Opie and Anthony.  No, no, no.  I thought you were really yelling at you today.  Now we're going to have a problem.  You want a war?  You have a small radio show on that.  Yeah, two guys that are making like fucking under 20 grand a year. 
[02:20:30]  You want a war?  What are you going to do?  You fucking jerk offs.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[02:21:00]  Ralphie Mae in studio.  He's playing Carolines all weekend long.  Carolines.  And we've got Joey Diaz.  Joey, where are you again?  Comedy on the Hudson.  Comedy on the Hudson?  Comedy on the Hudson, Jersey City.  8 o'clock both nights.  All right, very good.  I'm going to go see Ralphie tonight, if you don't mind.  And then maybe I'll try to see you Saturday. 
[02:21:30]  Are we off out there?  Ralphie's a man.  Huh?  All right, we've got, I don't know, we've got way too many people here today, but that's okay.  A bunch of people commented that they couldn't hear her talking because she was off mic.  Yeah.  Okay.  How long does it take him to fucking...  It's a whole thing.  I know.  It's a whole thing.  I'm so irritated.  It's a whole thing.  What they've got to do is they've got to find the volume and just turn it down.  A lot of people are saying they couldn't hear her.  And they're all bitching.  Get the mic.  It would be nice if we could hear what she was saying. 
[02:22:00]  We understand.  We were trying the best we could.  Sometimes we try things out here on the show.  Sometimes they work very well.  Sometimes they don't work as well.  Just work.  And it didn't work.  It didn't work as well, but we couldn't shove the microphone in front of our face if we're  supposed to be off the air, you dickhead.  Stupid.  I can't even get a...  Deez Nuts from Pennsylvania.  Look, Deez Nuts.  Oh, I've never heard that one before.  You jack off.  What an awful name.  I love that we're finally fighting back.  The whole Deez Nuts thing is not fucking funny at all. 
[02:22:30]  Do you know that's the name of my company?  Is it?  It's not funny anymore.  When did you name it?  A couple years ago.  See, it was probably funny back then.  Oh, it's still funny.  No, it's not.  It was never funny.  It's old.  It was never funny.  When you get old people, you get old people who have to write checks, and they have to...  Who do you make this out to?  Deez Nuts.  No.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  A little six-year-old little white lady, that's a little funny.  That's a little bit.  A little bit funny.  A little bit.  What kind of business are you doing?  Look at that.  That old lady's are writing out checks to you. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, come on.  Yeah, really?  How do you do this?  He's selling depend undergarments on the side.  I'm making money.  What do you mean, addicts?  Yes.  Yes.  Hmm, this coin collection?  I just fucking hate strippers.  Oh, dude.  Oh, dude.  I can't tell you.  I'm not a fan.  But I think it's because they drive you crazy.  They do drive me crazy.  I can't even get a stripper on my lap.  I'm such a fucking zero.  But you're too shy.  I'm the worst.  Like Joey, right away, just went, hey, come here, sit here, baby.  Yeah, fuck that.  And she's right on his lap. 
[02:23:30]  You're sitting there waiting for her to go, can I sit on your lap, Jimmy?  I don't like to impose.  I owe you, too.  I don't give a fuck.  I go to a strip club with a counterfeit 20s.  I do it all the fucking times.  Some of your prints on your home printer.  I'm talking about an apartment shit in the dark that will never even see it.  Thank you.  I go on there and make me change, bitch.  I just hate that fucking bouncer energy they bring with a bouncer.  Get the fuck out of here.  I know.  That's the whole thing.  You don't like that?  I hate it.  I'm with Jimmy.  I'm not a big fan.  That fucking energy.  Get the fuck out of here.  The attitude.  Man, what we need is just brides are just ready to just get naked. 
[02:24:00]  Well, the other two are go-getters.  Look, throw your finger back.  Is that okay?  Are you down with it?  Well, we'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  This should be the prerequisite.  Any brides coming in here?  They're getting hypnotized right now.  Let all the energy go once you go back further.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that makes good radio.  Have people hypnotize while they're driving.  Smart.  Well, the guy told us not.  Jesus.  Not the genie.  The guy told us, you know, make sure that you don't air too much of me hypnotizing the girls  because people will, you know, get in car crashes.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's power.  Let's test it out right now.  You know something?  Yeah, live life on the edge.  Right.  Not like it's our car.  If it worked, wouldn't we just be able to fly helicopters over Iraq and just say this  shit out the speakers and say now, dressing tutus if you're the opposition.  it's hard to make someone at ease when you're...  what could he possibly be saying  you're not a cocky, you're not a cocky  good luck  and doubles the relaxation, eyes become even heavier 
[02:25:00]  heavier and heavier  your eyes are gonna relax mother fucker  have a teacher like mine as the heavier your eyes become, you feel that sting  that's pride fucking with you  just look at the shape of my head and be grateful you're not me  just keep your body numb  you hate life, you hate life  you hate life, you hate life  I never go to fucking strip plus  write the fucking Craigslist  Jesus  Craigslist got the chicks? 
[02:25:30]  yes  I had no idea  you are really bothered  it's just one of those things, do you like it or not?  I can't be bothered with it  I dated one for five years, they're a fucking mess  I just know it  it's a fucking mess  I hate that fucking energy  you gotta tell them how you punched Carol in the head  oh this girl used to love me to smack the fuck  that's why I gained the weight after I broke up with her  you used to be a thin guy?  huh?  you used to be a thin guy?  I used to be a thin guy  every time I'd fuck her I'd smack her, pull her hair, kick her in the stomach  I was in shape  I used to tie her up  go to the store and call her from the payphone on the answering machine 
[02:26:00]  I'm gonna come home and fuck you in the ass  yeah  wow, and she was into that  oh, she loved it  and then I'd get home  I remember I took her to Miami for New Years one year  she couldn't come out unless I gave her a black eye  because she wanted me to fucking smack her hard in the face and call her a cunt  you know what's cool about that though?  because it really symbolizes a healthy childhood  for me or for her?  for me, hey listen  if you want me to smack you, I gotta smack you before  if you're sucking my dick, I'm gonna smack you in the face and knock you off  that's a party where I come from  you know what I'm saying?  run with it  you know what I'm talking about?

[02:27:00]  look at me, any chick who sucks my dick is really a filthy fucking pig  you know what I'm saying?  while they're sucking my dick I'm thinking that to myself  you know what?  you're a disgusting fucking slob is what you are  look at you  a tarantula  but how does it get to the point where all of a sudden she wants to be smacked?  I mean that's not  you know one day I was fucking her  I used to fuck her in the ass and pick her legs up  did I tell you one day I found an aluminum foil in her ass?  I don't know  I think she swallowed a fucking brownie  I was fucking in the muffler from behind  we were watching  we were watching Mission Impossible 1 o'clock  in Seattle  and I was  and I feel something hitting the Cuban egg roll as I'm banging her 
[02:27:30]  and I take my dick out and I go in her ass like it was wide open  I go in there like it was mine  and there was a little  I just put her on the table and kept fucking her  you know me  I'm a dirty  a little piece of foil  she had a piece of meatloaf or something  from the state deli or some shit  were you fucking Ave Maria?  and then she told me to smack her in the ass  smack me in the ass  and one day I was fucking and she go smack me in the face  and that's when I got good  you know what I'm saying?  cause you take out all the shit that's on your mind  you know?  wow 
[02:28:00]  and she kept telling me I want to suck your dick  and mid-while just knock me the fuck out  sure  why not?  would you close fist punch her?  I could never really close fist her  but I'd bitch slap her  yeah that mid  if you put that paw into any girl's face  tell them a story about how when she cut you  I mean when she ripped up your paycheck in front of you  oh I fucking  I fucking pulled the hair  I pulled the fucking hair so hard  that I ripped out like half the side of her head  and hair  so now she caught me  the lady next door sees me  she's a fucking crime stopper 
[02:28:30]  calls the cops  so I got the cops looking for me all over Seattle  I'm hiding the dumpster  you know what I'm saying?  and then I jumped by the dumpster  and there they are  surprised  they waited 5 hours for me  and they took me  and then they dropped the charges  because they had no  I just pulled the hair  and I said  hey I was getting a hand job in the afternoon  you know what I'm saying?  what the fuck?  freaky  wow  it's a crazy world  you know  and people on the stage  it's like dating a comic  the first year it's kinda cool  he's so cute  we do comedy  he just called me from Miami

[02:39:00]  who say  we're going to end homeless  but there's no resources  to end homeless  how do we do that?  end homeless  end homeless  we're going to end homeless  not homelessness  or  we're going to end homeless  I just love this guy up there in Boston  it's amazing  what a booze  we have to be flexible  and that's where we get  we're all flexible  we get through this issue  and I just say that  it's difficult  it will be difficult  we have to have flexible?  something like that  have flexible  how is this guy in office? 
[02:39:30]  did he send the gumon  for Kennedy to drive home?  it's a corrupt city  it's a very corrupt city  yeah  you really should say that  you really love the mayor of Boston  a lot of nepotism going on there  a lot of corruption  and people stay in office forever  Kennedy  Manino  these guys stink  let's go to Pat from Boston  hey guys  hey  that cookie he was referencing  I just wanted to first say  I love the mayor  also 
[02:40:00]  but that cookie reference  is like a Red Sox  reversed the cookie  reversed the cookie  that they were selling  and I hope you have the rest of the clip  because he does a thing  where he goes  Lot  here our prayer  punch it out  Lot here our  Lot  alright  Nathaniel grab that mic  we got an update  on the hypnotist and the girls  what's going on  you can grab this one  next one  well this is courtesy of Steve  so  it said  it looks like  two of the girls  have snapped out of it 
[02:40:30]  yeah  but the other two  are into it  or bought  I don't know  I'm trying to read Steve's handwriting  as I do this  and I stink  he doesn't write like he speaks  I think it says  the other two  that he brought  are  knocked out  uh huh  so the hypnotist brought a few people with him  those two are knocked out  but the two that have nothing to do with the hypnotist  are not knocked out  that is amazingly coincidental  that happens  that works out  that happens  you know  you gotta bring the people with you  that's good 
[02:41:00]  so what time is Creston coming back in?  I have a prayer  somewhere  I won't announce it to anyone including the Creston  one of my favorite things ever  where exactly is it  we can go  that's my favorite thing ever  that fucking idiot he is  who is it?  Creskin  Creskin would come in here with makeup on  and he would  he would predict all this crazy shit  and we'd start challenging him on stuff  he goes  ah I gotta go  I got a press conference  and we would try to ask him  where is the press conference  he goes  oh it sits there  to the west side 
[02:41:30]  we're on the west side  where exactly  that's in the 50's  we wanna go to it  well no no no you can't  cause I'm leaving right now  he stinks  he was the worst  we always had a good time with him though  Scott's pointing out that  Menino said  much like a cookie  I predict the Yankee  whatever he says  he goes that's news to me  cookies that make predictions  much like a cookie  I predict  let's go back to that  he's predicting like the cookie did  much like a cookie  much like a cookie  much like a cookie  I predict  much like a cookie  much like a cookie  much like a cookie 
[02:42:00]  I predict  also  as the cookie predicts  I predict  man I've eaten a lot of cookies  I've never  never predict  yeah  well I think the cookie  can probably predict that  it's gonna be eaten  yeah right  as the cookie  as the cookie predicts  I predict  man I've eaten a lot of cookies  I've never  never predict  yeah  well I think the cookie  can probably predict that  it's gonna be eaten  yeah right  as can anything else  within striking distance  much like a Buick  here's a quick one 
[02:42:30]  that's one thing that  really  fries my nose  fries my nose  is he doing bumps for Jesus  what does that mean  he thought it was coconut  and turns out it was crank  much like a cookie  what happened  we have  another update  yeah we have  the opposite of Mayor Menino  in the studio  Martini Steve  wow  with his perfect speech  much like a cookie  I predict  the Yankee dynasty  would have delicious results  right 
[02:43:00]  he's got an update  on the hypnotists  and the strippers  aha  yeah whatever  let our rep  so he's got  the one in the red  what was his name  Mallory I think  Mallory  thank you  she's almost out  the blonde  is completely awake  and I guess  she just can't pay attention  long enough  if the object  is to focus on something  she can't pay attention  for more than like five minutes  she says  winking at Danny  she keeps staring off  onto my computer screen 
[02:43:30]  boom  so she can't focus on him  long enough to even  attempt to get him  yeah  I say too that the one  in the red wanted to go  she wanted to be a part of that  so she's perfect  yeah  but they all look really  knocked out  the other two girls  that went are totally  knocked out and asleep  in their chairs  where'd they come from with him  exactly  that's coincidental  you know what  but the blonde can't pay attention  the blonde can't pay attention  someone take her coke  and give it to the hypnotist  isn't it kind of a big risk  on the hypnotist part  that they're gonna have an audience  full of people 
[02:44:00]  that are gonna be willing  to do this  and get up on stage  and not right in the middle of it  go this is so fake  you know how do they guarantee  that that's not gonna happen  at these live events  people get embarrassed  they wanna be a part of things  so even people who aren't plants  won't admit that they can't be  they're like nah  everyone that gets up there  to be a part of the hypnotist show  is a heckler at a comedy show  oh  they're the people that want  the attention  they wanna be the show  they wanna be the show  they wanna yell something out  and be recognized  and looked at and applauded 
[02:44:30]  i remember as a little boy  there was a magician  at a birthday party  where did he touch you  no no he didn't  we're gonna  I just made my little dick  disappear into his mouth  all I remember  hold on hold on  over and over  Anthony's on to something  cause every time  you go down this road  Anthony and I are thinking  here it is  we get to find out  who touched him  why Jimmy is Jimmy  the magician  all I remember  is it the magician  dammit it's not  all I remember  is a stabbing pain  in my buttocks 
[02:45:00]  liquor in my face  and ta-da  and they wiped my face  oh hocus poke you  he made me rub his wand  I uh... no I was  as a boy  I remember  the magician was at a birthday party  and looking for volunteers  I was begging to be a volunteer  I kept yelling  pick me pick me pick me  cause at that age  you don't know dignity  so you just yell and scream  he just kept pretending  he didn't hear me 
[02:45:30]  cause he knew I was gonna be  a fucking problem  so it goes back to  you were gonna be the ham  yeah  so the magician blew you off  and that's why you hate  the slippers that blow you off  anyone that blows you off  the magician  and what was he looking over your head  kinda going uh...  like let me look at you  and you're jumping around  like an animal  shy boy  me pick me  I wanna be a part of the magic trick  where you're raising your hand  and have to hold it up  with your other hand  by the elbow  oh me  oh me  me  I wanna be  I wanna be part of something  I feel no magic for you  exactly 
[02:46:00]  and then  and then they picked somebody else  and you went  awww  like when I went to  like when I went to see the firemen  in the fire trucks  they had to yell at me  to stop jumping in  out of the firemen's boots  did they?  he was always looking for attention  yeah so that's what you're doing  if you're doing the hip  where you're like hey look I got big boots on  I don't know  I probably  yeah it was like a Pat from Munaki thing  like hey these boots are made for not doing anything  hey let's uh...  let's say hi to Jeremiah in California  hey what's up guys  Jeremiah  you went to Vegas  and you got hypnotized 
[02:46:30]  what happened?  yeah my old lady talked me into getting up on the stage  and letting the guy pull his hypnotist shit  and I thought it worked for a little while  because when he went to pull me  you know snap you out of it or whatever  all I had was this urge to call  call 972-404-8501  and go to the Addison Improv  between 16 through 18  that was a good one  and why would he go there?  god dammit  he didn't say why he'd go there  I didn't find that one good  I didn't know it was coming  there was no  he didn't know it was coming 
[02:47:00]  but there wasn't a compelling build up to it  see there's got to be a compelling build up  and then  Jimmy's plug  thrown in  for no reason  so you got him plugging for you now?  that's kinda good  that was a plug for my improv  it's fantastic  thanks  we hate it  I love it  we hate this bit  they're great  every time someone gives you a shameless plug  we're gonna play another Bob Kelly remix  no  oof  and I got 20 bad ones  I will not punish him  I will punish all of you  all of you  we're paying for it  you listen to it 
[02:47:30]  that's right  Eric in Jersey  what's up Eric?  hey what's going on guys?  hey man  listen I was in a hypnotism class  about two weeks ago  over in Jersey  in Saddlebrook  so I bring this random broad up there  to volunteer to demonstrate how it works  and while she's up there on stage  in front of everybody  they tell her in her hypnotic sleep  that she's gonna be going on this  fantastic vacation  and imagine somewhere  you know cool and refreshing  she starts feeling herself up  in front of the whole class  and proceeds to take her shirt off  so there's about 100 guys 
[02:48:00]  that are ready to lunge out of their seats  and attack this sport on stage  and even the guy that was given the hypnotism  kind of freaked out  he's like shit this isn't supposed to happen  he kind of brought her out of it  and her eyes lit up when she came to  and saw that her shirt was off  pretty interesting stuff  not in the telling you just gave it wasn't  yeah  thanks no  I don't buy it  no way  she was just showing off you think  being a silly goose  of course  just showing off  oh oh  heavier and heavier  heavier and heavier 
[02:48:30]  heavier and deeper  and deeper  and whenever I say the word sleep  you will collapse into deep  deep  sleep  I just focus very deep  into my eyes  wow  I was nodding off there a second  yeah  we should have just played the record  of the Edmund Fitzgerald  it's a little shorter  and less redundant  and I'll say snap and sleep  and you will now  here's another clip of Mayor Menino  the Mayor of Boston  the crazy glue holding your eyelids  let's listen to this one Ant  I don't think the public understands this yet 
[02:49:00]  I don't think they understand  what difficult times we're in  but wait over a couple weeks  when I make my announcements  oh boy  they'll understand it  I'm going to core services  by anybody's definition  by Republicans definition  Democrats definition  socialist  green space  all those people  they're going to know when I say core service  and what it means  definition  green space  destination  well green space got everyone laughing  green space 
[02:49:30]  you're trying to say green peace  green  green party  green party  destination  green space  destination  that does trash  he is a mess  he is a mess  many people wonder in our nation's cities about  how to solve homelessness  there's two solutions for homelessness  home  housing  more housing  affordable housing  and better health care  that's two solutions  I mean the issue with homelessness 
[02:50:00]  we do a survey in the city  every year  every year  we go out and count homelessness  in the first week in December  count homeless  count homeless  homelessness  homelessness  he just gives up on the word  homelessness  low cost housing isn't a solution for homelessness  no  it doesn't mean you could have free houses  and the nut jobs that are homeless  aren't even going to know how to get through the front door  they're kooks  they're crazy people  they're insane people that aren't in institutions  that's what homeless people are 
[02:50:30]  you know that there's over a hundred thousand people that live below the streets of New York  really  chud  right  lucky news  that's the real deal  no  get free rent  humanoid underground dwellers  it's the mole people  mole people  they've done documentaries on them  they've written books on them  and the city is completely aware that there's like tunnels down there  a bunch of unused tunnels and the subway tunnels  one of the biggest is an Amtrak tunnel that they haven't used in so many years  a huge tunnel and there's just tons down there 
[02:51:00]  tons  and they come up  come up during the day trying to make a little living  you know collecting cans and begging and stuff  and then they go back down there at night  and they descend back into their hole  and they tap into some of the pipes that take showers  some of them have pets down there  and they tap into electricity  they got little shelters  little shanty towns and they got TVs and everything  it's a whole thing that goes on under the city  it's like Thunderdome  the city knows about it  barter town  two men in town  one man  barter town down there  master blaster 
[02:51:30]  but if they decided to clean it up and get all these people out  it would just be a disaster for the city  because now all these people would need somewhere else to live and hang out  yeah  there's tons of them  let's take them shopping in Jersey  there you go  there you go  that's a little though  mole people shopping spree  I think the estimates are close to 100,000 people below ground  really  yeah  oh yeah  the smell coming out of there is lovely  it's an army  baruto  it's an army of people  I know  and they're gonna come together soon  they organized  they're organized alright 
[02:52:00]  yeah  seal up those mole holes in one fucking match and a little can of gas  you know  no more mole people  alright let's go to this one  that would be great  Mayor Menino  imagine that smell  burning homeless people  yeah  nothing smells worse than just homeless people  my number might be high  but it's up there  it's up there  the amount of people living  this is probably like 800  no no no  only like  100,000 people  my number might be high  this report's just in  it's uh... five people  they found five  there's actually six mole people  yeah 
[02:52:30]  alright  he's got millions and multitudes  a mongrel race  could it be a bastard  mongrel race  both races  both races will be destroyed  that's not a direct quote  but it's close  close enough  here you go  let me get you that exact clip by the way  it's the Morlocks  here's Lauren  from Minnesota  had experience with mole people  Lauren  yeah I'm a truck driver  I was picking up a lot out here in Manhattan one time  alright hold on hold on  Lauren 
[02:53:00]  the male truck driver  alright  the guy  I guess it's L-O-R-E-N  Lauren  like Lauren  right  how do you spell your name?  L-O-R-E-N  Lauren  they have it spelled like we were ready to talk to a girl  so  you threw us off a little bit  alright so what's up Lauren  sorry I disappointed ya  it's all good  ah  them mole people in New York are funky  I was down there picking up a load of Madison Square Garden one night  and  when I got down there the place was full  and all of a sudden the streets clear out 
[02:53:30]  and I'm like I thought this was the city that never sleeps  and the guy that's loading my truck's like just wait a minute  and it was like the night of the living dead  all these people come up from underground to the soup kitchen  meet another driver  we threw out our  reggiest jackets we had  and went to the soup kitchens with them  them people are a trip  you saw them actually coming out of the ground?  I've never seen them come out of the ground or back in the ground  supposedly  not out of the ground  exactly  coming up out of the subways  alright  well supposedly some of these manhole covers if you go at the right time  you'll see them you know coming and going 
[02:54:00]  we're all coming up out of the subways  it's all the homeless people  we threw out our reggae jackets  went and joined them at the soup kitchen  got a free supper  yeah they could walk through the times  they are  they are some fun people to talk to  yeah  I'm obsessed with this whole mole people thing  obsessed  Keith the Cop almost took me on a tour  down below  how can he?  but he said the smell will get to you  he says no one can tolerate the smell  and there's so many rats  and the rats are so big that even  you know a brave brave guy gets a little freaked out and scared 
[02:54:30]  and you have to wear  do you see the people down there or no?  he said he knows where a ton of them are  yeah  yeah the cops know where they are  do they fuck with the cops down there or no?  I don't know  I don't know  I don't want to speak out  I don't know  you know but you have to wear boots all the way up to your thighs and stuff  because the rats will start nibbling  aww  start a nipping  a nipping  did I say nibbling?  yeah  nibbling's right?  yeah nibbling  oh ok good  Voss is their leader  alright here we go more  some old people scary 
[02:55:00]  they have perfect skin except for that one little blemish  we got uh...  you are not welcome here  you are clear skin  we got a couple more mayor menino clips here  yeah hope burns eternal in boston  and uh... every year we start off we hope uh... will serve a championship  last year we got to the fifth game and uh...  now maybe this is the year  hope burns eternal  huh  well that's kinda good right?  yeah that's right  we'll give him that one  The vice president is saying it's heightening the intensity, it seems, a little bit here. 
[02:55:30]  What's your level of concern?  Well, our intelligence unit is working with the state, federal officials,  keeping us informed if there's any heightening of our security in the city of Boston.  We're working with the federal officials to give us the information that we might need.  Do you think they're playing politics, sir?  I'm not saying they're playing politics.  I don't have the intelligence they have.  He said, are intelligent.  Yeah, intelligent. 
[02:56:00]  I don't have the intelligence they have.  I believe you.  And finally, one last clip.  I have did my duty, and I did it last Tuesday, Matt.  I can't believe I'm ahead of the schedule.  I have did my duty, and he did it last Tuesday, and he's ahead of schedule.  There you go.  That's today's Mayor Menino clips.  More to come in the coming weeks.  500,000 mole people.  Stop it.  It's not.  What was going on with the hypnotist?  Well. 
[02:56:30]  What did she say?  I didn't hear anything.  Why are you laughing?  Yeah, it's going real good.  Did she talk to you?  Yeah.  Are you sure?  I think he's trying to fuck them.  All right.  I think he's in there just trying to fuck them.  Wouldn't that be funny?  You can pot it up.  Yeah.  Suck my dick.  Suck my god.  And the whole time he was hypnotizing, he's saying, he's like saying, my name is Opie.  My name is Opie.  And then he brutally sodomizes him.  That's who they go and report.  Hey, Bo in New York. 
[02:57:00]  What's up?  Hi, ONA.  What's up?  Hi, little Jimmy.  Whatever.  Yeah.  I'm a conductor for Metro on Earth.  I see these mole people every day.  They're right by our break room.  At the end of the night, like by the bread place, searching through the garbage, picking  up bread.  I don't think it's 100,000, but I know there's a lot of them down there.  You're seeing a lot of people down when you're driving your train?  No, not so much in the tracks, because they'll get killed.  I mean, it's all electrified territory, and the cops pretty much troll that, but below  Metro on Earth, there's like, it goes below a good 10 tours, and then below that, there's 
[02:57:30]  like a power station and stuff.  There's all kinds of stuff going on under the city.  Yeah, that's the other thing.  You think, ah, there's a couple tunnels here.  No, it goes like 10 stories down.  It's all sorts of stuff going on.  There's access tunnels for like electric.  Right.  There's miles and miles of tunnels underneath there that they don't even use anymore that  these people just make up their camps in.  And there's communities.  There's like, you know, if Ope says 100,000 mole people, then there's like groups of 200  that live in a community where it's run by like, you know, they have a leader. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, only a few go up top.  Yeah, only a few go up top to get, like, that's their job, is to go up and get stuff  for the rest of the community.  They're the scouts.  There's like battles going on down there.  Oh, yeah.  His name is Cyrus.  Cyrus.  I like doing things like that.  No, it was them, the Warriors.  Riff.  Riffs.  They're remaking that one, too.  Of course they are.  Oh, boy.  And the game. 
[02:58:30]  Let's see.  Who's going to be in it?  What rapper?  Is Cool J going to play one of the fucking...  Can you take it?  No, but you know what?  The Longest Shot had that one guy in it.  That David Patrick Kelly.  You know, Warriors.  Yeah.  Oh, he's good.  He played Unger, whatever his name is.  I don't know what he played.  He played the guy that kills Chris Rock.  Whatever.  Really?  Yeah, Undertaker.  Chris Rock gets killed?  Caretaker he was.  Caretaker.  Chris Rock dies in the Longest Shot?  Yeah, he's a caretaker.  Jesus.  Remember when he went to his bulb and he puts the bulb up? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  I thought he...  I didn't know he was that guy, though.  I thought he was actually going to survive.  I thought he changed.  No, why wouldn't they?  Yeah, I thought they changed the movie.  He changed the movie.  They changed the movie, but...  Gee, thanks for wrecking the movie.  You know, what do you want me to do here?  History.  History.  History.  What about Burt Reynolds?  He plays...  No, I know, but did you have fun working with him at all?  Yes, he was a good guy.  He's a great guy.  He's got some crazy facelifts, though, bro.  Oh, he looks...  It looks like the Addams Family.  You know when you walk by and just the eyes move?  But you know what, man?  You're in the fucking... 
[02:59:30]  I mean, the guy is...  The guy is the king.  I mean, he's been dead and he came back.  That's pretty tough in this industry.  I mean, he was dead and they brought him back and...  He had eight movies last year.  He did eight movies last year.  That's a lot of movies.  God bless him.  And two of them.  He did...  Dukes of Hazzard?  Oh, he's in that.  That's coming out.  He did one of the Playmates that becomes soccer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  It was...  You have no idea. 
[03:00:00]  Strippers that become volleyball players.  Sure.  That must have been great.  Yeah, I think that's what he's got to do.  What's up there with Gator?  Yeah, that had to make at least $200 million.  The longest shot.  He had another...  You know, he had another five other movies that he did.  God only knows, you know.  All right.  We should take a break.  We got the hypnotist coming back in, hopefully.  Right?  It's got to get interesting.  Dude, if this guy doesn't get him naked, then...  Here's Keith the Cop.  Because there's another person on the line saying mold people is a media creation. 
[03:00:30]  Another person saying there's 500,000 mold people.  There's another guy on the line we want to talk to him, Paul from Brooklyn.  He says he claims he lived in tunnels for two years.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, O?  Give us what you know about the mold people.  Well, I mean, they're definitely down there.  It's not a myth.  I mean, some of these people are regular working people.  Like, they come up, they work.  I mean, you know, what do they do?  Some of them have regular jobs, like not an office job or anything like that, but, you  know, low-level sort of jobs, and they just go back down, and they live underneath the 
[03:01:00]  city.  Rent-free.  Rent-free.  And, you know, you do get the homeless people and everything that are down there doing it  as well.  And, yeah, from the few people that I've run into that are claiming to be these people,  and, you know, you're locking them up going down into, like, into the subway tunnels  and stuff like that, you know, they do this.  They have the societies and everything.  There's actually, like, a documentary movie that somebody had done.  Yeah, I saw it.  A black-and-white movie. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, there's one that's a color one, too.  I think it's, you have to look it up on the thing.  It's, like, mole people movie or something like that.  Mole people movie.  Mole people the musical.  I'm dirty, so stinky and dirty, I smell like piss.  But, you know, it's definitely...  I shit my pants.  It's not a myth.  Like you say, I mean, that stuff goes down how many levels?  You know, 10 stories, 12 stories down, some of it.  I mean, I've never really gone down that far. 
[03:02:00]  I've been down one or two stories, and you see, like, the old subway lines and everything.  You know, it's pretty neat.  Do they bother cops down there or no?  No, I mean, you know, you go down there, you've got to do what you've got to do.  I mean, most of them, they don't want to be bothered with what's going on on the outside.  Just go down there and beat on people if you're pissed off one day.  Go down there with the rest of your buddies.  A couple of nightsticks, right?  Yeah, knock them around a little bit, you know.  Tune up a couple of them, because they're not going to complain.  No, but like I said, some of them are regular people, you know,  and they're just beating the system or something. 
[03:02:30]  I mean, who the hell wants to live down there, but...  Yeah, they're also digging for water down there.  There's a big, huge tunnel that they've been digging for years and years.  From upstate.  Yeah, from upstate.  Yeah, it's a water tunnel.  Water tunnel.  That's like 60 stories down, I think.  Hey, wasn't that Die Hard 3?  Yeah.  Okay.  It was.  Maybe they're tunneling to the middle of the earth or something down there.  We don't know about it.  Warlocks.  But there you go.  It's the real deal.  Yeah.  And the smell down there is completely just out of hand, and the rats and all that, right? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah, because, you know, you get the garbage pile up, and it's not like they're getting garbage pickup or anything.  The floor is covered with guano.  That's nasty.  Where do they shit?  Wherever.  Wherever you want to.  Wherever, dude.  Hopefully not where you're walking.  I would think that if they have an organized little society, there's probably places that the head muckety-muck designates as the shit area.  What is it?  Dippity-dunk or dippity-what did the man say?  Whatever Menino said.  Yeah.  Who knows what he's saying? 
[03:03:30]  Diddly-dunk?  Diddly-dunk.  That's it.  Make sure when you diddly-dunk, it's not by our food.  Let's say hi to Paul in Brooklyn.  Claims he lived in tunnels for two years.  Paul, what's up?  What do you have?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Yeah.  When I was in high school, my stepfather was a real prick, you know, and I ran away from home, and I was sleeping on the subway, and I met one of the guys and said it was better than sleeping in the train.  And, you know, we've been there for about two years.  It was bad.  It was kind of fucked up, but it wasn't like, you know, Morlocks and all that other shit you guys are talking about. 
[03:04:00]  Any ass rape going on down there?  No, dude.  No.  I mean, it was pretty cool.  Then I'm not going.  How'd you get down there?  Well, like, some of the stations, some of the train stations that you have, you know, you can actually walk down on the tracks.  Yeah.  They're like subsets and other tunnels off of the subway tunnels.  Like, sometimes if you're riding a train, you look out the window, and you can see, like, little lights here and there. 
[03:04:30]  It's just tunnels off of the tunnels and the subway, dude.  So you have to jump off the platform, run down the tracks a little, and then cut off.  Like, for example, the one in two years was off of the A train line.  Yeah.  So you would go to, like, I don't know, like, in the, some of the, like, the local stops on the C train in Manhattan, and you just walk down the stairs at the end of the platform and then walk in.  And then you're there, you know.  I mean, I went to high school for two years living down there.  So did you have a bed and all that? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I had a bed.  I mean, the tunnel that we lived in had some pretty decent ventilation.  I mean, it was fucked up in the wintertime because, you know, it was kind of cold.  But it was, you know, it was what I had to do.  How many floors down were you?  It's kind of hard to say, like, floors because when you get down there, I mean, I wasn't really that far down.  It's like, because, like, once you go in the tunnels, it's kind of hard because it's dark.  You can't really see, you know, too much.  But the guy knew where we were going, and, you know, that's how I got down there initially. 
[03:05:30]  But I got maybe about two stories down.  Did it go down a lot farther than that?  Not the one that I stayed in, but I'm sure that they probably have some that are a lot deeper.  But the one that I stayed in was, you know, it wasn't that far down.  It was probably about two stories down.  Oh, cool.  Isn't that wild?  Yeah.  Wow.  And he went to high school and completed it.  How did you shower and stuff?  What are you doing?  You've got to bring a chick home.  Oh, well, I mean, I wasn't giving a lot of pussy, obviously, because, you know, what are you going to do?  I mean, I had a girlfriend that I would go to her house,  and she always wanted to come, you know, come visit me, and I was like, oh, no, fuck that. 
[03:06:00]  How did I get to your place?  All right, you get off the A train at 58th Street.  And then what?  And run real fast.  Yeah, you're there.  And then drive the train that don't step on the power line, you know what I mean?  How did you shower and all?  I shower at school.  You know, I go to school.  You know, I take my shit, get in there a little early, and, you know, I shower there, you know, if I could.  Or, you know, I go to the Y and I shower at the Y or something like that, you know.  That's crazy.  What about washing your clothes?  Well, yeah, that was kind of hard.  That was kind of hard. 
[03:06:30]  But, I mean, you know, you collect enough change and you go to one of the laundromats.  That's why, you know, you never go to a public laundromat, man.  There's a bunch of homeless people washing their nasty shit up there, man.  You never know what the kind of shit you're going to get on your clothes when you put it in the washing machine or the dryer, you know.  But, yeah, man, I go to a local laundromat and, you know, wash what I had, you know, steal a little bit here and there to, you know, go shop with them basically and get some new clothes here and there when I was trying to go out and, you know, meet a chick.  And, you know, that's it, man.  But, you know, I did it for two years and, you know, worked kind of hard and got a couple of scholarships to college and went to college for four years and everything is cool, you know. 
[03:07:00]  Nice.  But, you know, it wasn't anybody that couldn't stand sunlight or anything like that.  It wasn't any mole people or anything like that, you know.  Right.  Well, right on.  I'm not going to comment because I wasn't listening.  I don't want to say something that's been said already.  I was reading.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  Hey, did you get on with your life?  There goes Paul from Brooklyn. 
[03:07:30]  We've got to come short because the hypnotist is ready with his victim.  So why don't we take a quick break and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  Don't forget, Ralphie May at Caroline's all this weekend.  Yeah, baby.  And Joey Diaz at the...  Comedy on the Hudson.  Yeah, Comedy on the Hudson.  Jersey City.  Jersey City.  All right.  And we'll continue.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the only day virus.  John Hutcherson, 21, pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide in the death of last August of his 
[03:08:00]  friend Frankie Brougham, who was 23 years old.  Seems they're driving home after a night at the bar, which I guess you do a lot down there  in Georgia.  Do a little drinking.  You're driving home.  And I guess Frankie was feeling a little ill.  So being a courteous friend, he hung his head out the window to vomit.  Now, who hasn't done that?  Who hasn't puked out your friend's car?  We pretty much all have done that.  Your friend's driving home.  You've had a little too much and you need to puke. 
[03:08:30]  So you just roll down the window, stick your head out and take care of business.  Usually, no harm.  Without incident, the only thing that happened, maybe a little puke down the fender.  Down the quarter panel.  Down the side of the car.  And then your friend calls you the next morning, really pissed off, come over here and hose  down your fucking puke.  And that's because, usually, your friend doesn't veer a little too close to a telephone pole  support cable as your head is out the window vomiting.  So Frankie, his buddy Frankie's head was completely removed. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, that's terrific.  That's terrific.  Cut his head clean off.  Decapitated his buddy.  But it doesn't end there, folks.  No, of course not.  This guy, John Hutcherson, is so drunk, he doesn't even notice he's just decapitated his  buddy.  He pulls up to his house ten miles away.  He drove ten more miles with his buddy's decapitated body in the car. 
[03:09:30]  Must have been a real conversationalist, this buddy is.  What a self-involved ass.  Too busy trying to find a good song on the radio on the way home.  Dude, do you mind this?  All right, cool.  No, okay.  I guess not.  Listen to the words.  So he parks in the driveway, goes in and passes out, goes to sleep.  And the guy's still in the car.  The guy is still in the car with his shoulders and body kind of hanging out the window, to 
[03:10:00]  which the next door neighbor walks out, looks over and sees his decapitated body hanging  out the window and calls police.  They arrested him.  But he got to have five years.  Five years in prison.  He got on Wednesday.  That is drunk.  Wait a minute.  But he drove to his house?  Yeah.  Didn't he have to, like, drop his friend off?  You would think he would drop his friend off.  But I guess he was so drunk he, uh...  Maybe he thought he was probably sleeping.  He said, all right, just sleep it off.  He didn't say anything.  He just walked in the house.  Sleep it off.  He said, look, we'll go back and grab your skull tomorrow. 
[03:10:30]  I'm tired.  Just nap on I-80.  Look, I'm too drunk.  I can't drive you home.  Don't lose your head over it.  I'll take you home tomorrow.  Can you quit bleeding and hemorrhaging all over the side of my car?  We'll take your skull out of the leaves.  But I got to get a few winks.  Ow.  Yeah, that, that is drunk.  How do you not notice your friend's head is off?  Must have made that flung sound.  Shooing.  Dude, you all right? 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Sleep it off.  Silence.  Sleep it off.  Sleep it off.  He vomited off his head.  You ever feel like that sometimes after drinking?  Like you're going to puke your head right off?  What happened?  Puked his own head off.  Probably a nice clean cut, too.  Oh, yeah.  How long are you alive where your head is rolling down?  On the road right next to the car where you're, you're, you're still alive.  You're seeing the pickup truck go away.  Right.  With that last bit of blood pressure left in your skull and eyes.  Right.  Going, oh, no. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh.  This isn't good.  This is a bad day.  Say, why is that truck driving so fast away from me?  Uh-oh.  I was just in there.  I think that's my hands.  Ruby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Oh, my bitch.  Just a kiss on the lips.  And I was on my knees.  I'm waiting.  Get me.  Oh, my bitch.  She was shaking her hips.  So that was all I needed. 
[03:12:00]  We got a couple of the girls back in studio.  Yeah.  We need to give them some microphones.  These are the two girls that couldn't get hypnotized by, uh, uh, Salish?  Sal, Sal, Salish?  Yeah.  Salish?  Yeah.  I gotta call you back.  That's a hell of a name.  I forgot your name.  Brittany, the beautiful blonde, and the brunette was, uh...  Mallory.  Mallory, that's right.  You guys couldn't get hypnotized. 
[03:12:30]  No.  What happened?  Here, give...  Jimmy, you gotta work.  Help me out.  Work that mic.  Was he finger-banging you?  Was he...  Wait, wait, wait.  Help me out and just talk into the mics.  That's all I ask.  He sits there and takes his hand and goes back and forth, tries to weave and this and that,  and I'm sitting there and I'm starting to laugh, and then he's...  And when you're sitting there and he's trying to tell you, like, what you're gonna visualize,  he's like, you're gonna visualize your vagina talking to you, and then the one, Steve's  standing there and he's like, you're gonna visualize him nude and how small his penis is 
[03:13:00]  and all this other stuff.  All I could do is sit there and laugh.  And I'm sitting there and he's trying to, you know, work with me, and I'm like, I could  fake it if you want.  Oh.  Oh.  See?  Yes, you could.  So, do you believe in this, uh, hypnosis thing?  Not at all.  Do you know how to spell hypnosis?  Not at all.  I like her, she's alright.  Yeah, right?  And what happened with you?  I just didn't want, I just didn't want to talk to my vagina.  Your vagina? 
[03:13:30]  This guy was obsessed with...  I mean, I saw Steve's anteater.  What was that about?  When we pictured him naked.  It was very large.  Right.  Yeah.  His anteater.  You were supposed to picture him, uh, naked and you pictured him with a huge hog?  No.  No.  Yeah.  Unfortunately not.  No?  No.  And Annie, that means it was unclipped.  Really?  You pictured your rotten little European cock.  I'm uncircumcised too, dog.  What's the problem?  That's just awful.  I got a little turtleneck in the wintertime.  You know what I'm saying?  Who are you kidding?  That's awful. 
[03:14:00]  A little turtleneck.  Science.  The Cuban Negro.  The Cuban Negro, a.k.a.  turtleneck.  I'd like to attack that with, like, itching powder and a stapler.  No, no, it's fine.  It's fine.  Alright, so these two couldn't get hypnotized.  Who got hypnotized, then?  The two girls that you brought in.  That is a coincidence.  Yeah, that really is.  Let me just say something.  What?  They were so hypnotized, but the one sitting there in the chair, and she's sleeping, and  her eyes are flittering like this.  Like, she's trying to keep them shut.  Yeah.  I'm like, yeah.  Good one over there.  Well, I think we should get down to business.  Yeah, let's get down to business with the hypnotist.  Let's see some naked girls. 
[03:14:30]  Let's bring them in.  We're going to need a little room in here, though.  What about the naked girls?  What are we working that segment in?  All right, you guys.  Fat guys, you guys got to, like, go to that mic over there.  You got it.  All right.  We got to presume that would be us, right?  I think we're going to get him over there with the girls and the couch and stuff.  That would be a good place.  Are the girls staying?  Yeah, of course they are.  All right.  We're moving the guys over. 
[03:15:00]  Right.  We got Salish.  Salish?  That is the weirdest name, bro.  That's tough to say.  What's your background, sir?  I'm from the Fiji Islands.  Oh.  I hear that's very nice.  Yeah, it is.  It's beautiful there.  Yeah?  Oh, guys.  Fiji.  Yeah, somebody says they love the water.  So do I.  You love water?  No, the Fiji water.  Yeah, I like water, too.  All right.  That's what?  You got in the hotels. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Finer hotels.  Okay, why don't we, um, so how many people do you get hypnotized?  I got a couple hypnotized.  All right.  All right.  You brought them with you?  Where are they?  They're, Laura, where are you at?  Where's my girls?  Who are they?  Who are they?  Oh, they, uh, one of them is a friend of mine, and the other girl is a friend of hers, so.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Let's bring them in and see what we can get, uh, happening here.  Bring the ladies in.  Ladies?  All right.  Okay. 
[03:16:00]  Hey, everybody.  Hi.  Oh.  There they are.  Hi.  Hi.  Yes.  Uh, wait.  What's wrong with that girl?  Opie.  What's wrong with you?  Me?  Nothing.  What's wrong with you?  Ooh.  Nothing's wrong with me.  Ooh.  Ah-ha.  Snap.  You got served.  Um, it's nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  I'm Opie.  That's Anthony.  Hi.  Joey Diaz.  Uh, Ralphie.  That's right.  No, I'm just kidding.  Ralphie, May, and Jimmy.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben's hog. 
[03:16:30]  Ben's hog.  Yes.  You have to introduce it as a separate entity, because it is.  Look at him.  There he goes.  He has to throw that big delicious gift in the overhead on a plane.  Ben's got to meet you.  And that's Nathaniel, and that's, um, Eric, and that's Master Paul.  I'm never going to remember.  And those are three, uh, young ladies.  Oh, we met them.  And, um, that's Danny, and inside is, uh, Derek.  Right.  And, uh, don't forget the Bag O' Nuts.  The Bag O' Nuts comedy team.  And then, um, this guy.  Travis. 
[03:17:00]  Who was the, uh, club owner in Mississippi Burning, and then some guy out there with awful  sunglasses, and some guy and his girlfriend out there.  Who was the guy with the mustache?  That's Dawn.  I don't know.  Who's Dawn?  Works for our super agent.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, and that's about it, so.  And who's she, who's the guy she's with with that, that awful black-eyed stare?  Non-smiling face.  Oh, he's awful.  All right, so why don't we get something going here, Anthony?  All right.  What do you think?  Absolutely.  All right, so what do we got there?  Well, we got a couple of young girls, uh, hypnotized, and, uh, just see what we can make 
[03:17:30]  them do, and just relax them back in a deep, deep sleep.  You're going to find, you will find that whenever you're asked any questions, you will have the  uncontrollable urge to swear.  You will not know why, but you have the uncontrollable urge to swear.  In one, two, three, wide awake, you, and just relax with a deep, deep sleep, you're going  to find that you have a stuttering problem, and that's what happens when you become nervous,  but every time Opie or Anthony ask you a question, you're going to become very nervous 
[03:18:00]  and begin to stutter.  In one, two, three, there you go.  Well, ladies, um, we like being here.  You're having fun here.  Fuck that.  Oh, there's a statement.  There's a statement.  Jimmy trying to trip her up with some kind of wacky line of questioning that isn't a  question.  A statement.  Well, what do you do for a living? 
[03:18:30]  I'm a songwriter.  You're a songwriter.  That's a nice, uh, that's your occupation?  You get paid for it?  Fuck yeah.  Oh, again, the cursing I see is coming out.  Yeah, why the cursing?  Bad mouth.  They're a potty mouth, is what they say.  And how do you, uh, how do you make money, uh, writing songs?  Who do you sell them to?  Fucking clubs, record companies, I don't know.  Yeah?  Anything else but, uh, fuck? 
[03:19:00]  How about the S word?  Uh, shit.  Did you drop a, drop a C-bomb while we're at it?  Cockballs.  But I don't even understand how you make money as a songwriter.  That's your own, only occupation?  Yeah.  You're a singer?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, so you do gigs?  Yeah.  You play, you play guitar.  And you go to, oh, you go to piano.  And you go to clubs?  Yeah, I play in the city a lot.  In the city you play?  And, uh, what kind of music you do?  Um, shit. 
[03:19:30]  Okay, that's good.  You should have a little more self-confidence.  It's pop rock.  What is your music like?  Shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Pop rock.  Good plug.  Like Tori Amos.  Oh, okay.  That kind of stuff.  Fiona Apple.  Uh-huh.  Folk.  All right.  All right.  Should we talk to the giggling girl?  Of course.  What, uh, what do you do?  I'm in college.  You're in college?  Mm-hmm.  And what are you, uh, going to college for?  I'm studying engineering. 
[03:20:00]  Engineering.  Yep.  Cool.  Do they have a drama department?  Yeah.  You come off very high.  Why?  You come off like you're stoned.  I'm great.  I'm great.  Sure.  Really?  And, and what do you, what do you?  What do you, what do you go into school for?  I am mystified.  I'm, I'm studying engineering.  Engineering.  But what do you want to become?  Um, probably construction, either go into, uh, construction law or construction engineering. 
[03:20:30]  Now, are you afraid?  Let me ask you a question.  Were you, why were you so upset when Nurse Ratched said she told your mother?  I mean, there was nothing to be ashamed of.  You knew it.  You weren't ashamed.  And then you started punching your penis and cut your throat.  And I want to know why.  Oh, 10 for Billy to match his wang.  She was great in Boogie Nights, too.  Hold on.  Hey, let me go to Randy, Anthony.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Danny, I didn't get that one. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, Danny.  Doesn't she have the same car as, uh, Marky Mark in Boogie Nights?  Fuck.  Yeah.  And just smashed into a wall.  Let's say hi to Randy in Cleveland.  Randy.  Hey, how's it going?  Pretty good.  Hi.  This guy here, there's one thing you miss.  If this guy claims that he used to do this to help people medically, them guys make a lot of money.  Why would he quit just to do it for an entertainment purpose and take a pay cut?  Oh, good question.  I don't know. 
[03:21:30]  Salish?  Well, I get to travel all across the world, first of all.  And, uh, secondly, I get to see a lot of different things.  And third thing is, is I get paid quite well.  It's a great, uh, life.  Right?  It is.  It is.  It's a great life.  It's a great life.  It's a great life.  It's a great life.  All right.  Let's get the girls to do something else, I guess, because, uh, that one worked wonderfully.  Make out.  Where did Jimmy go?  Bathroom.  Make out.  Jimmy just leaves the show.  He gets spastic colon.  Whenever he wants.  That's the beauty of being Jimmy.  He gets to do that.  He just gets to do that.  All right.  What else you got there?  Well, it looks like the girls are starting to come out of it. 
[03:22:00]  We've just been waiting around for a bit.  Yeah.  With everything that's been going on.  I understand.  Around here.  Yeah.  It's still stoned.  That happens.  Right?  She's still sleepy over there in the corner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little missile of Permagrin.  The engineer.  Mm-hmm.  I'll bid you a house one day.  Yeah.  I mean, if you want to sit us down on that couch and put us under.  Yeah.  Sit down on the couch and.  Yeah.  It like wore off or something?  It wears off a little bit.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  It does.  It's like weed.  I was just looking at the clock and I don't think there's really enough time to reapply.  No, that's too bad.  No, no, no.  It takes like a few minutes.  Yeah?  She knows all about it.  Well, she's been hypnotized before.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Remind me to thank Steve after the show.  Jimmy's back.  Yeah, I had to be back.  Steve, you just missed.  Steve.  Jimmy, you just missed some great stuff.  What happened?  What happened?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Well, I don't know. 
[03:23:00]  I kind of like, I had to pee.  All right.  So, um.  Yeah.  Oh, you said Tori Amis.  The Max Girlfriend loved Tori Amis.  I'm not a big fan, to be honest with you.  Not of your stuff, but Tori Amis.  Well, you haven't heard.  No, no.  Is it good?  It's a snowflake girl.  Hypnotize the engineer girl to make her think that multiple Migs threw jizz in her hair.  He pissed the truth.  Multiple Migs.  Wow.  Those are good visual jokes we're flying off with here.  Yeah, that's great for radio.  Yeah.  It sure is. 
[03:23:30]  And so is this, sir.  Yes, sir.  Well, uh.  I'm a little mystified, to be honest.  Are you mystified?  Yeah, man.  It's like, she's obviously under, and you're obviously under.  It's like a little creepy.  No, they already made it.  They're coming out of it.  They're coming out of it.  When you were in the bathroom.  Maybe the hypnotist could hypnotize the audience to believe that this was a really good segment.  This stunk.  No, I don't know about that, Opie.  This could be the worst segment since we started XM.  We got the dancers.  Let's have a party in this, motherfucker.  Set it off.  Come on, baby. 
[03:24:00]  Put on the music.  Let's go.  Uncle Joey's ready to wiggle.  We'll end with a party, I guess.  Thank God for replays, because this will be immortalized for another five times today.  Oh, my God.  Eric, find another segment to throw in here.  Well, I don't know.  I want to know about this.  Yes, sir.  I want to know about them being under.  Are you still under at all?  Food!  You're very relaxed right now.  I'm coming out of it.  Yeah.  So you feel kind of relaxed.  We're standing.  It's better if you're sitting down.  A hypnotism hangover kind of a thing.  Yeah, you're supposed to be.  I mean, we're trying to stand up, and it's very shaky. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  You have nice toes, by the way.  I don't have a foot fetish or anything, but there was a relatively nice foot fetish.  You can't see it.  I noticed it was wearing off, because they didn't have that black and white pinwheel spinning  thing going on in their eyes like that.  Does he have lightning bolts that come out of his fingers and go, to hypnotize him?  His eyes, if you look into his eyes, it's crazy.  Yeah, you should try to do it.  Look into my eyes.  Look at his eyes.  Can I look at your eyes, mister?  They're mesmerizing.  They're deep and sultry.  I will mesmerize you. 
[03:25:00]  Hey, Mallory.  What happened when you were trying to be hypnotized?  Why didn't it work?  Why didn't it work?  I don't know.  Is that what you just asked?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She answered that, right?  I don't know.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  To tell you the truth, I really don't know.  I never really believed in it, so...  No, well, that's probably it.  I tried.  Gotta have an open mind, I guess.  Well, I tried to be open-minded, but it just, I don't know.  It just really didn't work.  Sir, why doesn't it take on some people?  Well, I mean, it takes on everybody on a certain point in time, but I mean, here you're doing 
[03:25:30]  it in front of people, and you know you're going to make an ass of yourself as well.  Right.  And you don't know what to expect for the first time.  Here's the thing.  A friend of mine...  Oh, thank you.  I've never actually gotten it done, but a friend of mine has said that there are times  where if you're going to hypnotize somebody, because it's a thing with the mind, that  it's not always going to have the same type of a thing with one person, that when you're  going to bring it to another person, there's always going to be...  Oh, everybody reacts differently, like completely.  But is there a way...  No, I think everyone's reacting the same way in the studio right now. 
[03:26:00]  Well, I want to know if there's a way across the board.  If you go across the board, is there a way with one person to the other person to kind  of make the whole thing...  Work for everybody.  Well, I'm not sure.  Well, it can work for everybody.  Good question.  Well, the thing is, people say that some people are not susceptible to it, and yet other people  will have a reaction that could be or not considered dissimilar.  It depends.  Well, I mean, if you look at brainwave patterns, when you're hypnotized and when you meditate,  same brainwave patterns.  I mean, all hypnosis is self-hypnosis. 
[03:26:30]  I know how to get someone there and keep them there, but they have to want to go there in  the first place.  Well, that answer sounded like one of Jimmy's questions.  Riveting.  Oh, well, I...  Back to the dancers.  Yeah, back to the girl.  Bring on the dancing girl.  Come on.  Well, thank you.  I mean, it didn't quite turn out like I had hoped, but, you know, what are you going to 
[03:27:00]  do, right?  That's what I say.  What are you going to do?  Oh, I hope he's passed.  No, I'm not.  No, he's not.  I hope he's not angry.  I'm fine.  I'm totally fine.  Do you have any place that people can see you?  Actually, I'm going to be at Seaside Heights at the Green Room tomorrow night.  Seaside Heights, the Green Room?  That's down there on the Jersey Shore.  On the Jersey Shore, yeah.  Of course.  Very good.  Come out, check out the show.  There for the weekend?  Just for the Saturday night.  Just Saturday night. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Very good.  You do realize this went horribly wrong, right?  Yeah, I do.  I do.  You know what?  This whole thing was just a piece of shit.  Can I be honest?  You know what?  I'm not fucking mad at this or anything like this.  No, you shouldn't be.  If you guys come out and check out the show, you know.  But why would we?  Well, there's people on your own turf.  Curie Gellar did better on The Tonight Show.  Yeah, I mean, you come out to see a show at a show.  It's a lot different.  Yeah.  I know you guys are cynical about hypnosis and everything else, and I've heard that before  I even got here. 
[03:28:00]  But the whole thing is, it's a great show if you get a chance to watch it.  Mallory, can you come here for a second?  I want to ask you something.  Mallory stepping up to the mic for Jimmy?  No, just sit here for a second.  Sitting on Jimmy's lap?  All right.  No question, just he wanted you to sit on his lap.  Smell really good.  You can sit on my leg.  You don't have to sit on my mule, because if I get a rod, I'll be embarrassed.  All right, well.  Did you think it was fraudulent?  I'm not saying him, but hypnosis in general.  Yeah, I definitely think it does.  Wow, you don't think it works? 
[03:28:30]  Obviously, it has to work on some level.  Some people.  I really don't think it does.  Yeah, and she's a very bright girl, you can tell.  Go down, check out the show, the green room down there, Seaside Heights, and judge for yourself.  She thinks it's a bunch of bunk.  It's my lucky.  All right, well, this is wonderful.  Maybe Steve can book somebody else next time.  Steve, yeah, it's cool, man.  It was like a very full day.  The amazing cluster fuck-o, maybe next time. 
[03:29:00]  Steve's going to book a painter, and he's just going to paint the wall, and we're going to watch it dry.  Jesus.  The phone book reader.  All right, we're going to let you guys be.  This was wonderful.  Well, they're telling us we've got to get you out of here.  Yeah, we've got to get you out of here.  Unfortunately, we've got to get you out of here.  All right.  Let's hear it for ladies.  Sir, thank you for showing up.  Don't be down.  Don't be down.  Don, I see you're looking a little like, huh?  It does work. 
[03:29:30]  It does work.  Well, obviously.  We had us doing shit.  Like, I couldn't open my eyes at one point.  It was like...  What did you do?  That's like our audience listening to this segment.  Shout out to your eyes.  We can't quite...  Aw, man.  It was cool.  We did some cool stuff in there.  That happens.  Well, that's good.  You guys didn't hear it.  I'm sure they're doing some good radio somewhere else.  That happens.  I had some funny lines on the way over in the cab.  Yeah, exactly.  That's it, huh? 
[03:30:00]  Next time, bring that recorder with you there, Jimmy.  All right.  We've got to let you guys...  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  There they go.  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Poe.  No, no.  Don't call him back, though.  Don't get that fucking thing started.  Let him go.  Did you see that guy, bro?  Are you fucking crazy?  Why?  He was good.  Oh, please.  Wow.  And he brought two victims with him.  You know what I'm saying?  Jesus.  Oh, it could be.  Let me think.  I'm trying to think of a worse segment. 
[03:30:30]  No, it's top five.  No, no.  Hold on.  It's top three.  Top three.  That was brutal.  Worst segment.  I read the whole paper.  Wait.  I'm trying to think of a worse segment, though.  I know there was something that was worse.  It was...  Dustin.  Dustin Diamond.  Dustin Diamond was really bad.  Oh, please.  Ralphie May's first visit.  Oh, it's like that.  No, my first visit was epic.  No, you killed.  Look, as far as us being on XM, I'm saying Colin Quinn, when he was on, and nothing against  Colin or anything.  That was just the way the stars were aligned. 
[03:31:00]  It stunk on ice.  Colin has been brilliant on our show in the past, but the last time he was on, we were  all tired.  Colin was tired.  It was probably one of the worst segments.  I thought it was pretty magical.  I like Colin.  He's my man.  I know.  So do we.  I love him.  But it just wasn't working.  But it just wouldn't happen.  That also...  That will be officially the last hypnotist ever to be on our program.  Wow, really?  I think that dude was fucking retarded.  Did you look at him?  He wouldn't leave.  Like, you're torturing him.  He's like, well...  He was trying to salvage something. 
[03:31:30]  Something.  Eric.  From the whole thing.  I want to see how good you are.  Uh-oh.  Can you replace this segment in the replay?  Yeah.  You can, right?  I don't think you should.  With what?  Why?  No, we shouldn't.  I don't think you should replace it.  No, leave the brutality in there.  It's so god-awful.  You just gotta leave it in there.  You know why you gotta leave it in there?  You can't be great all the time.  To show these fuckers what bad radio is.  Sometimes they bitch about stuff.  And we're like, holy shit, we were having a good time.  We thought that was good.  And these motherfuckers will start bitching about our show going, that stunk today. 
[03:32:00]  No.  That stunk.  Dude, you're...  You're...  The...  All the chat lines.  All the...  The message boards.  The message boards.  They hate me, dude.  I know.  He sucks.  He's a fat ass.  He's a fatty fat.  Yeah.  I make one fat joke.  Oh, I'm a dick.  Okay, please.  Fucking cocks.  Fucking...  We gotta love it.  We gotta...  But we don't read them or pay attention to it.  You guys don't.  I went in there as a goof.  I'm like, oh, shit.  We always don't.  There we go.  We got a huge story going down.  They intercepted a flight from London to JFK. 
[03:32:30]  It was a mistake.  Huh?  They're saying it's a mistake.  Canadian fighter jets are scrambling to escort the jet in for a landing.  It had a...  Yeah, I feel much safer now that the fucking candidate is on the case.  I know.  Yeah, you fucking mind.  I felt secure until they said Canadian fighter jets.  Yeah, better like getting the fucking Marines from Blockbuster to take over.  Why don't you have the hypnotist bring the fucking plane down through osmosis?  That fucking sleeping pill.  Sleep, sleep.  Oh, my God. 
[03:33:00]  I couldn't even look at them anymore.  But you see them standing there and those two fucking, they've got to be like beat up women.  What are those women that get beat up in a shelter?  And you have like a cup of coffee and a fucking pretzel and they follow you somewhere.  Those are those two.  Battered.  Oh, the engineer.  She couldn't fucking make a pillow.  Did you see?  What's the engineer?  I think they inadvertently hit the hijack button.  Oh, my God.  That one had the red nose?  What?  Yeah, I think they inadvertently hit the hijack button.  That's what happened.  These guys.  Yeah.  Okay.  They're virgin.  They're all wasted.  They're all...  You know, virgin, you get to sleep. 
[03:33:30]  Are the girls going to get naked?  Send the shower.  Yeah, all right.  Naked.  Ooh.  No.  They all look at...  It's so fun.  It's so nice when you say something like that, and they all look at each other out of the  corner of their eyes and start shaking their head, no.  No, I don't do that.  No.  It's fucking Friday.  Oh, my God.  We got strippers that won't strip.  We got hypnotists that can't hypnotize.  I'll strip.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm a fat dude.  Yeah, there you go.  That's a spit.  See what I'm saying?  There you go.  There we go.  That's all we needed.  That's all we needed. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, nice.  Guys are so easy to satisfy.  Come on.  I'm about it.  Come on.  That's all we needed.  She's ready for the party.  Blondie, what's the problem?  What are you, Catholic?  Let's go.  Get it off.  What are you saying?  Are you really so am I?  I'm not.  I'm Protestant.  You know what?  I'm Protestant.  Same shit or different smell.  I'll get it off then.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, that hypnotist was just pissing me off.  Yeah, he was really bugging you.  Yeah, because you could see he was bullshitting.  He was like, let's try it again.  Yeah, he was bullshitting.  How many times are we going to try?  I know.  When they said, well, we'll sit down and have him redo it, I was just like, oh, no. 
[03:34:30]  He cannot sit down and redo this.  All right, we're going to get to the phones here, Anthony.  Why don't we do some phone calls?  Let's go to Kenny.  Hey, Kenny, what's up?  Today I learned that Canada has fighter jets.  Yeah, no kidding.  Who knew?  And I also learned, I believe that Anthony says worse instead of worst when referring  to the Bob Kelly stuff, which we'll learn in the replay in about a half hour.  That's the worst?  Worst?  That's the worst.  I don't know what I said to tell you the truth.  I can't even remember.  Let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  I've been hypnotized.  What's up, boys?  Listen, the show is pretty good. 
[03:35:00]  Not you.  It had its moments.  It had its moments.  What about the whole Gordon Lightfoot thing?  That was kind of cute.  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  I learned that Anthony says stunk on ice every fucking day.  Do I stunk on ice?  No, not every day.  I do say it a lot.  But it has to stink on ice for me to say it.  You know.  All right.  People will pick and pick every day.  Every little goddamn thing we do on this show.  Stucksuckers are brutal. 
[03:35:30]  He says stunk on ice too much.  All right.  Now I'm going to be all self-conscious and never say that again.  We created them and now they're attacking us.  We created them.  They love you and they attack you.  And now they want to eat.  They want to eat like the mad scientist that makes an army of monsters to defeat the world  with and they turn on you.  No, get back.  Get back.  You will obey me.  I know.  And then they eat you.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  What's up, Rob?  Yo.  Hey.  Rob?  Rob, come on.  Help us out. 
[03:36:00]  Everything is failing right now.  Everything.  All major organs are failing.  System failure lights are blinking on.  Bob Kelly's got another leg we can break.  Right.  Rob.  Are you guys failing?  Yes, stupid talk.  Oh, sorry.  Okay.  System failure.  System failure.  The last thing I had on the air was Chris Rush and the line that sunk him was Turkish towel.  Oh, and another thing.  You guys do say a lot.  Anthony, Opie, little Jimmy.  You know, you guys should try to, like, get away from that.  Pull up. 
[03:36:30]  Pull up.  Pull up.  E-e-e-e-e-e.  Altitude.  Altitude.  This show has gone into a nosedive.  Nosedive.  We are fucking just spinning out.  I wish we got hijacked.  And we started out so good.  On fire.  The show, you could graph this show.  Excuse me.  We did not start the show off well today.  I thought it started off pretty good.  With the Bob Kelly remixes?  Oh, but they were bad Bob Kelly remixes, but it was funny.  Like, there were a couple of good ones.  I didn't mind the Bob Kelly remix.  All right.  Okay, look.  If you graph the show, it would look like a big tit. 
[03:37:00]  It started off low.  We tried to bring it up.  And then it went back down.  She saved the show right here, Opie.  All right.  She can save it.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  She's on the console now.  Cancer pulled halfway down.  She's topless.  All the way down.  She's smacking her ass.  You girls really want to get naked?  What's your deal?  You don't show topless nothing for the boys?  You want to dance?  What's the story here?  What's the story?  He's working it.  I like the way he works.  I like the way he works.  Let's get the party started. 
[03:37:30]  Let's go.  Hey, Red Devil, let me bite you in the little muffler there.  Come on over here by Uncle Joey.  I need a big bump, and then I'll do whatever.  Yeah?  Yeah, you'll have a big bump.  She needs a little bump.  Ah, yeah.  Hold on.  You got any aspirin in the studio?  This works all the fucking time at 2.15 in the morning.  Yeah, right.  Grind up a little bit.  I did it on the set of the longest yard.  Drink a lot of booze.  Drink a lot of booze.  I met a girl at a bar, and she's like, I need some blow and shit, and I'm sitting in my  hotel, I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do?  I went in the bathroom, I crushed up some aspirin, and gave her three full-bate aspirins.  She was so fucked up in her head that she was gyrating in the fucking hair. 
[03:38:00]  Bare aspirin.  Bare aspirin will get you fucking high as a kite.  She sniffed it?  Yeah, it's good for you.  You got to see, no hangovers in the morning, no headache.  You wake right up, you fucking...  Oh, yeah.  You must be my lucky star.  You should have called.  Get the Bag O' Nuts guys in here.  I had it here, but I dropped it in the toilet.  You dropped it in the toilet?  What happened?  I don't know.  I took it out of my bra, so I wouldn't drop it in the toilet.  Oh, you dropped your blow.  No, I don't do that.  No.  What about the little jars?  Whatever it is, you dropped it in the toilet. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, little K.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, K.  Yeah.  I'm thinking old school.  I'm thinking 1986.  What the hell's going on in here?  It's unbelievable.  Hey, Bag O' Nuts guys, thanks.  Amen.  I wish we were in here for the hypnotist segment.  You would have said that.  At least you guys got to see some tits and got some hypnotist shit going on.  And we didn't bring that cat.  I wish you three guys would have beat the fuck out of them.  That's our next project.  We're going to knock the shit out of that fucking swami. 
[03:39:00]  Imitation, Ming Rames looking motherfucker.  Yeah, we weren't with him, man.  Did you see him?  He was horrible.  He was like, oh, his eyes.  Did you see the one retard next to him?  Whoa, look at his eyes.  They're so mesmerized.  And I'll go, you'd be mesmerized by fucking silver, you dumb fucking cock.  They were actually blue contacts, it looked like.  Yeah, you know, that guy's a fucking scamp.  We should just go down to Seaside tomorrow and blow him up.  What do you think that terrorist dick?  Let's go to the fucking green room, you and me, naked, and just grab him and get Ralphie  on top of him.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, man, I want to know, why the hell did you turn into a pussy all of a sudden? 
[03:39:30]  What do you mean?  You guys will tool on anybody and, I mean, rip the shit out of guys, play good cop, bad cop.  And that guy set you guys up to where you could have at least salvaged the bid into something  memorable.  You know, the best part about this thing is that on the West Coast, the Friday replay starts  at 11 o'clock at night, so there's no hell way I'll be listening to it again.  Yeah, honestly, there was nothing there.  I was looking around, trying to find...  Did he throw the poker chips at the back?  I know, I was just...  I was trying to find an angle, and I just didn't have it. 
[03:40:00]  I didn't have it.  You're right.  It was just awful.  It was just so bad, there was no angle to go for.  Yeah.  Man, there was stupid Mr. Clean Arms folded.  Yeah.  He's a big dude, too.  These guys, they're in no danger.  Confronting something that big and scary.  Yeah.  You're matching clothes on the floor.  Are you girls shy about getting naked?  I'm not even being a dick, I'm just curious.  Are you guys shy about it, or...?  No.  Did you dance?  I've never danced naked, though.  You've never danced naked?  Really?  Yeah, no, it's go-go, where I am.  It's bikini.  That's it.  You're looking at it.  And, and, you mean dudes actually pay? 
[03:40:30]  This is what I was telling you guys last night at the restaurant.  This is what I was telling you, yeah.  What a bunch of hell of a dance.  And they're just paying for lap dances, and I'm like, basically, we hump until you're hard,  and then we leave.  What the fuck is this?  You get us three minutes for $20, and I'm like, thanks.  That was easy.  What the fuck?  I'm baffled.  Who the fuck does this?  Who pays for this?  Remember, we're going to have a fucking...  We're going to have a fucking zero.  We're just a bunch of fucking zeroes.  I can't fucking believe this.  We're going to have a bachelor party for you here, but...  I know, there's no bachelor party for me. 
[03:41:00]  I'm getting married in a month, and I fucking got friends with the fucking hooligans.  Steve, Steve, Steve, you're fired.  Martini Steve's fired.  Firing, Steve.  This is the fucking worst.  Martini didn't know the fucking hit the team was the scam.  I got up early under the promise of bitches.  Fucking hot chicks.  I get titties right here.  It's great.  Fucking say God the girl in red's helping me out.  No offense, not for nothing, but I ain't get nothing off of you.  Steve promised us to these girls to do something.  We've been turning down strippers for months, but Steve's like, no, I'm telling you, they'll  do stuff.  No, these things are the girls.  Before the segment, he goes, guys, we talked to the girls. 
[03:41:30]  They're going to do pretty much anything you want.  Really?  Just get everybody out.  Really?  Yeah, get the fuck out.  Just get the fuck out.  Everybody just go.  Everybody just go.  Please.  So we can have...  Man, this could have been a lot better.  That's all I'm saying.  Come on.  Anthony, can you play the Hulk music?  One by one, everyone's going to leave.  We have a minute and 40 seconds to do this.  You can't find it?  He's looking for Hulk music.  Can you find it?  I can find it always.  All right, Dark, start playing the Hulk music.  Say goodbye here.  Jeff. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, I found it.  All right, hurry, hurry.  Turn off that music.  All right, Bag of Nuts, guys.  Thanks.  Get the hell out of here.  Bag with two Gs, onuts.com.  Oh, he's trying to...  Oh, fast, fast.  At the Improv on the 11th and 26th.  Check out the website for more information.  All right, thank you.  Get out of here.

All right.  We don't want to get naked shit.  I am so fucking tired of it.  All right.  You're out of here.  Anthony and I will now leave, too.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  This fucking show is stuck.  Take the clothes off.  Just leave and walk away.  As the show quickly hit the bottom.  There's unfunny in here.  It might make me say I just...
