<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show opened with a discussion of Opie’s near-miss encounter with Al Pacino, followed by a critical review of *Righteous Kill*, starring Pacino and Robert De Niro.  This transitioned into a detailed, explicit recounting of the previous day's events with adult film star Brie Olsen, including graphic descriptions of her sexual encounter with a staffer ("Black Earl"), her attraction to Jim Norton, and Norton's reactions.  The hosts briefly touched upon the 9/11 anniversary and the political symbolism of Obama and McCain’s Ground Zero visits, before moving to “Primetime Gossip,” focusing on a producer’s hand injury and speculation about its cause.  They also promoted upcoming appearances by Colin Quinn and their Hurricane Ike coverage.  The segment referenced other celebrities, including Kevin Bacon and Kira Sedgwick.

Next, the hosts presented their top ten list: Al Pacino and Robert De Niro reading "Top Ten Reasons I Like Being an Actor," complete with their own commentary and jokes.  The unexpected news of Barack Obama staying at a nearby hotel fueled speculation and jokes, including a possible stunt involving the President.  A new intern, Dave, was introduced and subjected to ribbing about his appearance, virginity, and Jewish heritage, culminating in a surprisingly funny and offensive “stereotypical Jew sports report.”  Colin Quinn was present in the studio throughout this portion, contributing comedic input. The “FU Line” segment followed, featuring listener-submitted angry messages alongside discussions of Jim Norton’s upcoming HBO show, a Nazi-linked stadium sponsor controversy, and a barrage of jokes about ethnic stereotypes and historical events, including the Holocaust and 9/11.  A *Independence Day* clip featuring Judd Hirsch was repeatedly mocked.

A recurring segment featuring caller David, framed ironically as promoting diversity, sparked a listener complaint from Elad regarding its potential for negativity.  This transitioned to a positive experience at B&H Camera, with employees expressing their enjoyment of the show. Opie recounted a drunken altercation with Gene Shallot.  Caller Jason defended the David bit and the hosts’ response to Elad.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a cultural clash between Hasidic Jews and a woman on a bicycle in a revealing outfit, followed by criticism of Michael Bloomberg's bike paths and anti-smoking initiatives.  A digression involving "Pal Talk" webcam girls ensued. Colin Quinn, as a guest, discussed politics, expressing frustration with Sarah Palin and other figures, along with tangents about *Idiocracy* and aging celebrities.  A large portion of the show was dedicated to Walter, who requested female callers to laugh for him, resulting in awkward interactions before a somewhat successful conclusion with caller Leslie and an offer of Chris Rock tickets. The show concluded with discussion of future plans, including a possible collaboration between David and another individual, and further banter referencing earlier segments and listeners.

A chaotic live audience segment followed, highlighted by tension between the staff and intern David.  “Hip Hop Ron” performed his self-composed song, "Damaged," to mixed reactions. Intern Danny discussed human rights concerns (two-family homes in Queens and poorly-run delis) and participated in improvised scenes from *Casino* and *Back to the Future*.  David’s perceived rudeness was discussed, alongside numerous off-color jokes.  Radio Steve participated in a skit, and a phone call with Jay Moore was hampered by technical issues. The segment featured audience participation, irreverent humor, and vulgar language.  The segment concluded with discussions about various movies and the show's upcoming plans.

A phone call with Jay Moore dominated the final segment.  Moore performed impressions of Frank Caliendo, Harvey Keitel, Colin Quinn, Chris Tucker, and Chris Penn, often blending them together. He promoted his appearances at the Orleans Casino in Vegas.  Opie and Anthony interacted with Moore, discussing Frank Caliendo's impressions (Bush, Madden), and engaging in banter and obscenities.  The conversation touched upon the World Series and a Darryl Strawberry anecdote.  The segment included a studio audience of around 20 people, references to Bobby Kelly and Rich Voss, and a pre-recorded segment from "Cam" introducing a song with suggestive lyrics.  The show concluded with mentions of a listener’s birthday and a "line of the day" segment featuring descriptions of sexual acts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Ghost! 
[00:00:30]  The Opie and Anthony.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intenous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  march jocks.  All right, I'm going to start breaking stuff.  Seriously.  Watch this.  Now we need a new one.  Now we need a new one.  Oops.  Just slow in there.  All right, and now I'll pass the road.  Wait, no, not yet. 
[00:01:00]  Hold on.  Please, hurry.  Ready?  Yes.  I wanted you to smell it if it smells like Elio's pizza.  That's all.  That's all.  That's all for us.  Hold on, everybody.  Here she goes, go.  Holy crap.  It's more than just your life you're hurting.  Think about your family.  Think about your friends. 
[00:01:30]  Think beyond the moment.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Friday.  Nice.  Friday.  Hey, what's up, everybody?  Hi.  We're going to do this thing again, if it's all right with you.  Oh, this thing?  This thing we do.  This thing we do. 
[00:02:00]  Because this is all we do.  It's the Opie and Anthony show starring Turk and Rooster.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you failed miserably yesterday.  And Bob forgot, too.  Yes.  I knew there was something we had missed.  Talking about the Pacino De Niro movie, of course.  Yeah.  And Jimmy did a great job of describing the douchiness of the movie.  And one glaring omission was the names of the characters. 
[00:02:30]  Turk and Rooster.  Only second to Cobretti in movie.  Who were the names in Kurt, Russell, and...  Oh, right, right.  Kurt Russell.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Tango and Cash.  That's another one.  That's another one.  Turk and Rooster.  Hey, Tango.  What? 
[00:03:00]  Cash?  Were they like, hey, Turk.  Hey, Rooster.  Rooster.  Yeah.  Ooh.  I forgot.  Turk and Rooster.  Can I start by just saying...  Sure!  ...that Jimmy was accurate?  This righteous...  Is it righteous kills or righteous kill?  Righteous kill.  Righteous kill.  All right.  I'm getting horrendous reviews all over the place today.  And they are everywhere.  De Niro and Pacino are everywhere trying to promo this piece of crap.  Can I start by saying they're everywhere to the point... 
[00:03:30]  I saw Al Pacino last night in the restaurant I was in.  That...  When you texted me last night, I was like, what a coinkydink that is.  And there it was Ope sitting at a restaurant, and I guess Pacino's in there.  I swear to God, after all that abuse yesterday, I'm sitting with my girl at this great restaurant.  I should give it a plug.  Gabriel's...  Where is it?  On 60th.  60th.  Right around Time Warner for the New Yorkers.  He's 60th Street.  And I went there once, and we saw Kevin Bacon and his lovely bride of many, many years, 
[00:04:00]  is Kira Sedgwick.  Kira Sedgwick, who is so effing hot in person.  Ant and I discussed this for like a week afterwards.  She is ridiculously hot, looks way younger in person.  Yeah.  And then you see her on TV, you see her in like print ads, and you can't believe it's  the same woman.  A little hackered in the movies.  And then live, she was, yeah, pretty hot.  I was thinking to myself, wow, Kevin Bacon is cheating on his wife because, you know,  she looked that much...  With her younger sister.  Yeah, she looked really young and just ridiculously hot. 
[00:04:30]  But anyway, it was that restaurant, and I'm sitting there, and all of a sudden I look toward  the door, and I'm like, no way.  There's Al Pacino walking in with his head down, mumbling to myself.  Of course.  My movie sucks.  Movie sucks.  Very crowded in here tonight.  And he gets escorted to like this back room area.  I'm like, holy yes.  And, of course, I'm doing this dumb thing on ondayradio.com called Opie's Eye, and I'm  like, why didn't I take the picture?  Of course. 
[00:05:00]  You have to.  And I had plenty of time because it was like a runway.  He comes into the restaurant, and easily 30 feet before he got to right behind my girl,  literally walked right behind her as I'm staring at her.  And I didn't take the picture.  So then I just showed Jimmy my great picture.  It's up on ondayradio.com.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  It could be a few things.  Well, what happened?  Make of it what you will, because to me, it looks like bad pictures of a fireworks display. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  You know what you do?  If you squint, it all makes sense.  I'm squinting.  My eyes are shut.  The picture's up there, but basically, I waited about an hour in the restaurant more than I  should have.  It turns out the waiter was a huge fan of our show, Anthony, a Boston kid, trying to  make it in acting.  And he's like, oh, that Dementor World CD you guys put out 10 years ago.  I was working in a record store.  That thing flew off shelves. 
[00:06:00]  I'm like, I know.  But we never really got any money for it.  But it's still good that a lot of people have that out there.  Yeah.  And then the owner's a huge fan at Gabriel's.  So he comes over.  Why didn't he bring you over to Pacino?  I was kind of hinting.  That's exactly what I was going for.  And he's like, yeah, De Niro's stopping by.  But Robert De Niro never stopped by.  I think that's what he was hearing.  They're probably promoing in the restaurant that his movie's so bad, his hand shaking  on the way out like politicians.  So here's me. 
[00:06:30]  And I make fun of Jimmy all the time about celebrity photos and stuff.  And I realized the bathroom is right next to that room he's in.  Oh.  But you got to stop short of that room to go in the bathroom.  You got it?  Uh-huh.  So I go to the bathroom and I get my BlackBerry all set up.  And then I leave the bathroom and I make the right turn into the room he's in.  And now I'm awkwardly standing there like, oh, I'm in the wrong area of the restaurant.  There's a couple having dinner. 
[00:07:00]  And then Al Pacino is holding court with like six or seven people, a lot of younger people.  Looks like family members or something.  And I'm just staring at Al Pacino.  I'm like, how am I going to take the shot, take the shot?  How am I going to take the shot?  And I'm like, I can't take the shot.  So then I awkwardly put the BlackBerry behind me like this in my back pocket kind of.  Make a blade on putting it in my pocket.  I spin and click and walk.  As you're turning.  Turn, click, walk.  It was my technique that I attempted last night. 
[00:07:30]  And the results are up on owendayradio.com.  Papa rotten.  Stink.  I blew it.  And then we're outside for.  Dude, that's tough.  You keep to hold up a camera.  That's a tough one to pull off.  But it's Al Pacino.  That's a biggie.  That is a biggie.  Especially with everything we've been, well, mostly you guys have been doing.  I'm like, man, if I come to work tomorrow with an Al Pacino shot, these guys are going to bow.  Well, he called me.  I got a call because I was napping. 
[00:08:00]  And he's like, dude.  And he told me Pacino is here.  Get down here.  And the temptation, because he and his girl had just sat down.  Yeah.  I think they just walked in.  But I was like, there's just two schools.  I wanted to run down.  And I stand there.  But I'm like, it could be two hours.  The guy just went down.  Oh, you're crazy enough.  You would do that.  But I'm like, you can't do it.  Well, the first call went right to Jimmy.  I'm like, Jimmy, here's your chance.  He didn't have any security.  I think he had like a black SUV out front and some older driver security guy just kind of standing there. 
[00:08:30]  Because then afterwards, we stood outside like idiots for about 20 minutes.  He's the guy that throws the ladder out so I can get in.  Hung out for another 20 minutes.  And then I had to give up on my Al Pacino shot, unfortunately.  But you never know.  I was kind of bummed.  I didn't know who he was with or anything.  He could have said he was in a back room.  So I'm like, I kind of worked out the math real quick.  I'm like, you'd have to stand outside.  You have no idea.  I had no one with me to take the picture.  Because you might be gone by that time. 
[00:09:00]  No, if you showed up, we would have got something.  I would have waited.  But, you know, it was starting to get creepy.  We were just kind of hanging around.  It went from cool, we're hanging a little bit, to this is really creepy and we need to move on.  But you never know.  Sometimes people with family are really weird.  And I had this vision of him walking right into the car he was with.  I just go, no, no, no.  And then hop it right in and I'm like, you wasted two hours of your life.  Yeah, true.  So I was kind of glad I didn't because there's no guarantee.  People are checking out my great picture of Al Pacino on ownedayradio.com. 
[00:09:30]  And Kevin from Connecticut, one of our regulars, he writes, Opie, you snapped a picture of the elusive Littlefoot.  Yeah, that was anything but Pacino.  Littlefoot.  Littlefoot.  And then I was so barred in the butt that I'm like, you know what, I got to post a picture because the story is hilarious.  This is how lame I am.  I was a panicky Pete.  I wrote that in the text.  Pacino still, I think, does plays.  Like, he's almost a guy who is somewhat gettable if you want to go see him in a play.  I don't know if De Niro does plays anymore. 
[00:10:00]  A lot of these guys, if you really, really want to get a shot, a play is a place you could probably do it.  Yeah.  A lot of times they come out in the back.  Stage door.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But there you go.  That's my little dumb story from last night.  I almost had a picture.  Coincidental.  Of Al Pacino, which has become everything, everything we're doing on this radio show.  But isn't it weird how when someone that famous, because the night, Tuesday I went and saw Alan Waldo talk on 66th Street at the Borders, at Barnes & Noble, he did a talk for his paperback. 
[00:10:30]  And he was talking about being a celebrity.  He goes, when people meet you sometimes, they lose motor skill control.  And it was very funny, the story was telling me, it was amazing how people don't, like, whatever fires during normal life just doesn't.  And when a guy like that walks in, you really lose perspective on the way you'd normally act.  It's like, ah!  Yeah.  You just want to hit.  What the hell is that?  You're just like, connect with him.  Ah!  Gone, gone.  It's weird.  Yeah, what is that?  You want to make some type of connection.  You want to make an impression. 
[00:11:00]  You want to be remembered by that person, I think.  You want to be the person that isn't everybody else.  Yeah.  But you're completely everybody else.  Yeah.  I told you, I was getting into a cab one time, and Bruce Willis and his girl were getting out of it.  And I got in the cab.  End of story.  I wanted there to be more to that so bad.  Of course.  So if I ever saw him, I would probably say, yeah.  Hey, you were getting out of a cab.  I was getting in.  How many times has that happened to you in New York? 
[00:11:30]  You want to connect sometimes, it's just impossible.  Oh, no kidding, really?  All right, we got the trailer for Righteous Kill.  Oh, well.  Well, we're going to get to that in a second, but these phones, they need answers.  Let's say hi to Shane in Tennessee.  Shane.  I was going to say, fellas, cut the malarkey.  What happened with little Jim and Brie Olsen yesterday?  Oh.  Well, we got to set that up for this side of the show.  Everybody knows what's going on.  Shane, I think he said his name was Shame.  I'm like, oh, good.  The Righteous Kill writer. 
[00:12:00]  Long way to go, Jim.  It worked.  We had one of our favorite porn stars.  I like to say porn star.  I say adult film star.  I know.  That's where we're different, Anthony.  Porn star.  I like that.  Porn star sounds cooler.  Yeah.  Sounds dirty.  We had Brie Olsen and I forgot the other one because she barely talked and barely did  anything.  Caden Cross.  They're doing the Exotica.  I should give that a plug.  A little outrage out there in where?  Edison?  Well, at first it was in Secaucus. 
[00:12:30]  Secaucus, right.  And they threw it out and now it's in Edison and they're not too happy that it's there,  but they're letting it happen because it's not near as cool.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, that mayor of Secaucus seablocked me because the Secaucus is right outside the city.  Yeah.  Edison's like 45 minutes from there.  It's easy.  You cross the bridge, you're there.  Sure.  I couldn't go.  Ah, look what movie trailer is on.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a second.  Yeah!  So Brie Olsen, who's becoming huge in the porn industry, was in and she's a good egg.  She'll do just about anything for us.  She's great, man. 
[00:13:00]  And she did just about everything yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  She did something with something and she, how do you explain it over here?  Our old pal Black Earl had a little fun with Brie Olsen yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And it had something to do with his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, and her.  She knelt down, like he was sitting there in a chair and she just kind of just put her  hands on his legs.  Yeah.  And was kind of just kissing his stomach.  Yeah.  And her breasts were out. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You could say it like that?  Yeah, I think you could say that.  All right.  That's what she was doing.  And, uh.  Things happened.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I want to kind of like, towel.  Oh.  I want to kind of let everyone know it was a, uh.  There's a certain thing.  A blankety blank.  There's a certain thing guys enjoy doing with women that are well endowed up top.  There's certain things guys enjoy doing with that.  That's right.  Yeah.  You nailed it. 
[00:14:00]  Um, and that is what was done, um, uh, to a crescendo.  Oh, yeah.  It finished in a crescendo.  Jewelry appeared.  Exactly.  Jewelry appeared.  But this Brie Olsen, she, uh, she, uh, she's very confident, very sure of herself, very  sure of what she does.  She loves what she does.  Certainly does.  And then it came to our attention that, uh, Brie Olsen had a crush on somebody, a boy,  like a, like a little school girl, excuse me. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, school girl crush on somebody in the room.  God, that picture disgusts me.  There's a picture of Earl and Brie Olsen kissing.  Just tongue, tongue kissing, open mouth kissing with Earl.  That is a horrid picture.  That is everything.  Look at this blonde girl.  Oh, is that horrid?  We can post that picture.  Our old pal Earl.  So, uh.  Uh, so then we find out that she has a crush on Jim Norton.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  And, uh, and everyone wants to know, you know, what's going on with that.  Holy mother of God.  We, we, Danny, it's upside down.  Can we put that picture up there?  There's a picture of Brie's hiney upside down.  Yeah.  She was wearing a dress, but she, uh, it seems she forgot to put on her, her undies that  day.  Mm-hmm.  When wearing a dress that short and forgetting your undies, uh, it rides up a lot.  I know.  So we were able to see a lot.  I could see her hiney.  I know.  Oopsie.  I was so embarrassed.  I kept going, Brie, your dress.  Yes, pull it down. 
[00:15:30]  One point, I zoomed in with the PalTalk camera.  Yeah.  And it looked like, uh, uh, a gynecological exam.  Oh.  Uh, in my camera.  I thought you were going to say it looks like, it looked like Hurricane Ike.  It did look like Hurricane Ike.  Heading toward the shore.  A swirling mess toward the eye.  There's Hurricane Ike.  And look, there's a hurricane right behind Ike, making his way toward land.  Look at that.  It looks like someone should be going, hey, how are you doing?  Dude, how sexy is that? 
[00:16:00]  That angle is really nice.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Really nice.  That's the angle every caveman saw and realized, I know what to do.  Yeah.  Grab him by the hair and drag him off the screen.  Into the juniper bushes.  Shoot.  So, uh, there's a, so she was beyond shy when we, we, we, uh, let Jimmy know that she had  a crush on him.  And my history with, she completely changed.  She was like shy and like, yeah, very reserved.  Like she was a little school girl.  I, I've talked to her before. 
[00:16:30]  She's been on the show before.  So like she and I had, uh, had, uh, emailed each other and, uh, you know, I think we even  texted at one point.  I have her numbers and stuff, but it was, it would always go on for like a week or so.  And then you just, you, cause she would go back to where she lives and, uh, it's 34 C's  or they D's and they're, they're real.  Look at them.  They're amazing breasts.  Um, I mean, whoo, lovely.  Yeah.  I just went, that's how you react to them. 
[00:17:00]  It's, it's a guttural thing.  Is that the after shot?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I could tell things look a little glossy.  Yeah.  The picture's, uh, taken in on glossy paper.  So, uh, people need an update, Jimmy.  People are assuming that you, you, you, uh, I don't know that there was some action last  night.  Maybe hooked up as they say.  Well, we, uh, we all left.  You know, her and her people had to go back to, um, Edison, because they couldn't go to  Chikakis because the mayor, who, uh, I hope has fallen into a manhole cover and banged 
[00:17:30]  his groin on a nail.  Manhole cover?  How do you fall into a manhole cover?  If you're, um, you're in a helicopter and you fall out of it and you're headed towards  a manhole and they put the cover down real fast.  I'm an ass.  Uh, I'll be going to a manhole cover.  I suck.  Turk rooster!  Cock-a-doodle-dough!  Uh, he, uh, he, so he, they were in Edison, so, uh, no, they left, actually.  I, we, we said goodbye out in front of the XM building and, uh, I know. 
[00:18:00]  Oh.  Oh, there's your update, everybody.  I wish I, oh, oh, oh, boy, yeah, boo, yeah, well, a lot of people say boo today, Jim.  Yes, that was my, my inner thoughts, uh, but I couldn't do anything.  So you walked one way, she walked the other?  Well, me and, nah, we.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous! 
[00:18:30]  You know, and you might not mean it, but those sound clips kind of tie in with me feeling  ridiculous.  Yes.  It's, I, uh, me and Bob Kelly talked for a while on the corner, and that literally was  the end of it.  That was it.  Because she's, uh, unfortunately, the, the exotic expo I would go to in Edison, I absolutely  would, but I'm, I'm doing a gig in Connecticut this weekend.  Oh, damn, you guys just can't find the time.  It's, it's probably not going to work out this time, but, uh, I'll, I'm sure I'll see  her again.  Um, she's, and then she's winging off back to Indiana, which is her home. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Uh.  Fort Wayne.  Why don't you, uh, you know, book a little flight?  You fly out there, or fly her back here, or something?  There's still a lot of confusion.  Now, Anthony, you're a single man.  Uh-huh.  Would you be telling the same story as young, young Jim Norton?  No.  No.  Would you even be here today?  No.  Oh, I'd be calling in sick.  Uh, you'd, you'd hear my voice.  Probably from. 
[00:19:30]  I would have to, um, use one of those men in black things, though, that make you forget,  because I couldn't think of her and Earl together like that, and then, like, be with her.  I understand.  So close from, you know, when she was kind of with Earl.  It's against what you believe.  I'm doing that.  I understand.  Well, it's just, it's kind of, you know.  I understand.  I think any guy.  Yeah.  Uh.  But, uh, I don't know.  I probably would have anyway.  She's pretty hot.  Yeah.  I just would have made a, like, shower in bleach or something. 
[00:20:00]  Just the thought of it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Earl.  Yeah.  But it's Earl.  We've known Earl forever.  He's, like, the whitest black guy we've known.  Yeah, but you know what it is?  There's certain parts of a woman that are very entertaining while you're in the act of making love.  Uh, and I wouldn't be able to, um, utilize those because Earl had fouled them.  After a shower, I would, to be honest.  Yeah?  Yeah, look, because it wasn't, uh, let's be honest.  They didn't have any type of real, nothing they did could have been any kind of a disease risk. 
[00:20:30]  Not that Earl has anything, but there's nothing that they did that could be any kind of disease risk.  Yeah, but a shower, I would want her to shower like, uh, Taylor in Planet of the Apes when they, uh, hose him down in the cell.  That's the only type of shower.  Dude, I would have accepted.  Or Bruce Willis in 12 Monkeys when it gets back for decontamination.  Or tire to the top of your SUV and then go through a car wash.  Yeah, yeah, just something like, a shower just wouldn't cut it. 
[00:21:00]  Or I'd want to watch her shower and really, she'd have to come out and her upper half would have to be rubbed raw with Brillo.  Get the big car wash brushes.  Yeah, yeah, just kind of hose her down.  Oh my God.  I don't know.  I tell you one thing, this is why it wouldn't bother me, because my history is so seedy.  Well, we know, yeah.  It's like, ah, I almost don't, it's more comfortable for me when a girl has a history that is somewhat similar. 
[00:21:30]  A little seedy.  Yeah, because it's like, I don't feel embarrassed about any of it, or like, well, I can't talk about that, or all of this.  Because girls who do porn, most of them are pretty open, like, even if there's stuff that they haven't done, they're like, eh, who cares?  Yeah.  It doesn't freak them out.  They're not grossed out by it.  They'll talk dirty to you about whatever it is.  There's nothing like where they're like, oh, gotta back off on that, or what?  You did what?  Yeah.  They just don't care.  No, I probably would have.  Of course you would have.  But there was just no interest.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We got some of the, I think we got some clean pictures on O&A Radio.  And we have to get the clip.  We at least get the clip, the picture of her sitting on Jimmy's lap looking all hot.  That was sweet.  It was a sweet shot.  The clip of Anthony, if we have it to play, was so funny.  When he was telling me that I should leave immediately, what he would be doing.  Can you get that?  That was, you know what I'm talking about, just a highlight.  I almost called that last night.  It was beyond funny.  It was so comedically wonderful.  Yeah.  The contrast between Jimmy and Anthony yesterday, as far as where Olsen went, and what each would 
[00:22:30]  have done was pretty amazing.  See, Anthony's looking at a quick hit.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking at the next 30 years.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, okay.  There lies the difference.  You thought I was calm, cool, and cool.  Yeah, you were.  Look, your mother and I met when...  Your mother!  We have to break.  We have to break.  You're talking to a very dark child.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we're just getting started.  877-212-ON-DAY.  We got the Righteous Kill trailer.  We got to play that. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah!  We got Al and Mr. De Niro on Letterman doing the top 10.  We got to play that.  Mm-hmm.  We got movie reviews from this horrific movie.  We got to talk about that.  Can't get enough of this movie.  We got...  What else do we got?  Oh, we got to talk about Hurricane Ike.  Oh, could be doing some damage to Planet Houston.  Yeah.  Proven God wants everybody to move back to New Orleans.  Yeah.  Get out.  Get out of Houston.  If time's done here, leave.  Yeah.  Please leave.  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  So we'll talk about that as well.  But first, Primetime Gossip with Sam Roberts.  We're back, and it's time for more Primetime Gossip.  Opie and Anthony radio show producer, Iraq DeSexbagel, recently showed up to work with an apparent  hand and arm injury.  It was obvious that he might have had a broken hand.  Yeah.  And possibly a broken elbow, right?  Yeah.  Iraq immediately downplayed the injury in an obvious attempt to hide the truth.  The hand's not broken.  It'll be fine, too.  I see it. 
[00:24:00]  Ace bandage, though.  His condition had many people on the show concerned for Iraq's safety, a sentiment echoed  by the people who checked him out at the emergency room.  She sits down next to me, and she looks at me, and she goes, is this a domestic abuse issue?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  She goes, I have to ask you, is this a domestic abuse issue?  Is everything okay at home?  I said, everything's fine.  Everything's fine, huh?  According to our sources, that may not be the case.  We hear Sex Bagel catches beatings from his lovely fiancé on the regular, and his poor 
[00:24:30]  attempts to cover all of it up is doing nothing to convince anyone that he's not a victim.  When I signed in, and they were taking my insurance information, I said I got hurt at work.  I kept saying I got hurt at work.  On a serious note, we here at PTG would like to reach out to E-Rock  And let him know that no one can help him  Unless he first helps himself  Remember E-Rock, the bruises and the broken bones are not your fault  But for God's sake, ease up on the sandwiches a little  Good luck, Sex Bagel 
[00:25:00]  We'll catch you next time with more Primetime Gossip  Opie and Anthony  Broadcasting to the retarded  Sexual innuendo  Naughty radio show  Yes, this is naughty  That feels good, doesn't it?  What the hell is wrong with you guys?  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony are now back  Hello everyone 
[00:25:30]  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  Turk and Rooster  Righteous Kill  Hurricane Ike  Sarah Palin  Tina Fey  Those are all good words to Google today  Brie Olsen  Brie Olsen  Brie Olsen, yeah  Jimmy's mule  Yeah, and you see my mule frowning  I guess they're trying to get Tina Fey to play Sarah Palin 
[00:26:00]  On the season premiere of SNL  Of course she's going to be on that  Yeah  Yeah, she would be really dumb not to  Yeah, that's a great opportunity for her  And then it just hit the wires  That Obama's going to be on SNL tomorrow night  Wow  That's pretty cool  What's he doing?  Is he just going to pop on  Maybe one of those cameos during the news?  It's called a walkthrough  He'll kind of just walk through 
[00:26:30]  Yeah  Say hey  All right  And then leave  That's my impression of what he's going to do on SNL  I have a question  Maybe someone could do a little research  Because I'm not going to  All right  The candidates there  McCain and Obama  Both went to Ground Zero yesterday  For the 7th anniversary of 9-11  And put flowers down there  I believe McCain had been down to the site before 
[00:27:00]  A few times  I'm not sure  But I think this is Obama's first trip there  And if it is  I find that despicable  I find it divisive  That on an election year  7 years after the fact  He then decides to turn up  And go down there and pay tribute  It's such a ploy  During an election year  For him to do that 
[00:27:30]  He's using the 7th anniversary of that tragedy  To get FaceTime at the site  Despicable  You didn't think it was cool  They walked almost hand in hand  Down the ramp  Why didn't he go  The first year  The second year  The third year  Fourth year  Fifth year  Sixth year  Why the 7th year  The 8th year  Why did he go on  Now he's running for president  I can answer that 
[00:28:00]  He was still in college  Oh is that the fact  Yeah he was still in college  And now  Oh okay  If that's the case  Then okay  He was on the 7 year plan  And you know  Finally he's out of college  And he's a big boy now  Big boy  I just don't  And again  I'm not 100%  On the facts here  But I don't remember  Hearing about him  Going down there  On any of these anniversaries  And paying tribute  Then  It's on  This election year  Where in a couple of months 
[00:28:30]  They'll be choosing  The president of the United States  He's the candidate  And now he turns up  At this 7th anniversary  It's very divisive  You probably wouldn't have heard  Before though  2004  When everybody knew who he was  Don't forget  2002  2003  Or even in 2004  It wouldn't have hit the radar  That he was there  I think it would have been  This is his second visit  To  They would have said something  And I haven't really seen  Any information  On whether he'd been down there or not  Or McCain  For that matter 
[00:29:00]  I just assume  Since he's been a senator  For longer  And it's kind of  You know  In his realm  Of what he does  That he would have gone down there  To pay tribute  Or something  I don't remember McCain  Ever being down there though  So  They could both be doing this  I'm not sure  That's just it  I think they should force  Obama  And McCain  To be the ticket  Get really crazy  This election year  Yeah  A Republican  And a Democrat  Force those two  To figure it out 
[00:29:30]  Down there in Washington  Yeah I know  We wonder why the Jews  Can't get along with  The Palestinians  The Palestinians  Can't get along with  The Jordan  Or whoever it is  Yeah  We can't get two parties  To run together  Yeah  They hate each other  Oh absolutely  Absolutely  I thought it was kind of cool  They were kind of  You know  Walking together yesterday  What are they going to  Duke it out  Rolling down the ramp  In a pile of dust  Just punching each other  You usually don't see that though  Yeah  Yeah that's true  While they're running  Yeah  That's true  If McCain had any guts  Or any political savvy 
[00:30:00]  Here's what he would have done  I'm sure there was a moment  Where they probably  Whispered to each other  It always happens  What McCain should have done  Is if Obama whispered to him  He should have just loudly said  You can feel how you want Senator  But I don't feel  That we brought these attacks  On ourselves  Oh god  Oh my god  Yeah  Oh that would have been  A good one  Why not man  Oh you just hear  Oh  I didn't say well  But I didn't  Yeah he's trying to say  Don't deny it now  But he's trying to say 
[00:30:30]  I didn't say that  As the whole crowd  You can't even hear him  Because the crowd's like  Oh  Hey we gotta finish up our bit  It's a quick  Probably a dumb bit  But it's something we observe  Every year  The local news  How they have to go  From wacky  To serious  Back to wacky  Yeah  And  So let's just go through this  It's quick  Channel 11 here in New York  The local quote  News  That's your local news 
[00:31:00]  Call it local quote news  I don't really find  Any real news there  But on Wednesday  September 10th  This is how they open  Their news program  Live from New York City  U of 10  CW 11  Yeah  And that's a look at downtown  Wednesday September 10th  Folks  Good Wednesday morning to you  All's good right  Yeah  And then yesterday  September 11th 
[00:31:30]  The same news  Live from New York City  You're watching the CW 11  Morning News  And you're looking at  Downtown Manhattan  Of course the tribute  In life still blazing  Oh Sam should be fired  That was today  Yeah  That was today  Yeah Sam  Oh Sam  Track 2 should have been 3  And 3 should have been 2  Oh now I look stupid  Oh Sam

[00:32:30]  Yeah  And very somber  Very very somber  You know  No goofy stories  No  And then  This whole bit is ruined  But then  What is today going to sound like  Live from New York City  You were watching this  Ah whatever  Ah whatever  Just cut it off  That bit only works  If you play the tracks in order  In their proper order  Thanks Sam  Thank you  Yeah  Destroy that  That one didn't work  You played that like a Tarantino movie  Yeah  You gotta kind of figure it out at the end  Alright  There was uh 
[00:33:00]  I'm breaking out into a  Flop sweat  Oh like you  Look at my forehead  Flop sweat on  It's not even that great of a bit  But  No  It's really bad  If you play them out of order  What you just did  What that moment reminded me  Of a scene  In The Righteous Kill  Where you go  Oh  You go pretend you didn't hear that  There was a scene with De Niro and Pacino  And there's so many  Turk and Rooster  Yeah what's wrong with you  Turk  Turk  And Rooster  Rooster  Turk and Rooster  Ugh  Wow 
[00:33:30]  It should have been  Rooster and Lollipop  Because that is what the writer is  Um  So the  There's a scene where  They're having  This talk  And the  Thing  It's so hokey  And terrible  I think this was almost meant  For an older cop  And a younger cop  To be doing together  Of course  And uh  But they're the same age  And De Niro's going  Well I'm gonna do  This  And Pacino's going  Something about  You shouldn't do this  And De Niro goes 
[00:34:00]  Well forget this conversation  That ever happened  And Pacino goes  What conversation  Oh  That's funny  Cause he like  He said forget it  And he's already like  Why  It was so  By the way  I saw  That's such a cliche  Louis C.K.  Came to the comedy store  Last night  And he brought  Ricky Gervais with him  And of course  Ricky was at the premiere  So we were chatting  And we were talking  About our show  And uh  We just  Me, him, Bob Kelly  And Ricky  And Ricky's wife  Or girlfriend  Were just joking 
[00:34:30]  About Pacino's  And he didn't notice  The lifts  Ricky didn't notice  He was in the movie  But he didn't know  It was a quick  Shot of Pacino  At his lifts  And we  And he was laughing  When we told him  He's like  No I didn't see that  And I just  Started talking about  How we were making fun  Of the  And he goes  You were doing that  On the radio  Like we were killing  Pacino on the radio  I'm like  For 40 minutes  Of course  He just really  Really enjoyed  Our beating  Of Pacino  He should have  Came in today  He loves this show  He really does  He had a great time  The one time he came in  I'm gonna find out  Who it was 
[00:35:00]  But the reason Ricky  Is not on the show  This time  And we found this out  A couple nights ago  It's  AIDS  Yeah  Yeah it's really sad  I mean he doesn't have it  But he's trying to get it  And he's busy  It was  A good weight loss program  It really is  He was feeling a little  Hefty  It's Paramount  Somebody at Paramount  C blocked this show  Intensely  And purposefully  And Ricky's person  Is in London  Six hour difference  And she was fighting  To get this on  But he's not controlling  His schedule  While he's there  That is the way it works 
[00:35:30]  But I'm gonna find out  From Roland  Who this person is  Cause it's not  It shouldn't be a hidden fact  And I'm really  Really irritated  It was a purposeful block  By Paramount  To keep him away  From this show  Yeah he's done great  On this show  We've always had fun  With him  He likes the show a lot  Yeah  So I wanna find out  Who that disgusting  Revolting person  Of Paramount is  Well you got his  Attention today  Colin Quinn  For the third day  In a row  Let me think  There was something  I said  Yes  That Colin's 
[00:36:00]  Gonna have a problem  Colin wasn't listening  I actually said  Something a few minutes  Ago that made me  Think of you  I was hoping  Hold on hold on  Don't say it  Let me write it down  Let me see if I'm right  Okay Jimmy's  Gonna write it down  Because he was hoping  You weren't listening  Wait hold on  Hold on  Alright  Alright he's writing  Jimmy's scribbling away  On a little piece of paper  I was hoping  Seeing if he can match  Colin  On this match game  Moron edition  I like this game  Alright  Yes  So Colin  I'm gonna get this one  Because it's a 
[00:36:30]  Are we ready  Yeah  It's a general sweeping  Jesus Christ  Drop the Pacino  De Niro movie  It's  Have pity on the audience  Why you never did  When you performed  It was  It was  It was  It was one day ago  We're not finished  I can just imagine  People  Alright what was his  What  Yeah what was his  Oh mine  When we were talking 
[00:37:00]  About McCain  And Obama running together  And I said  How can we expect them  To get along  In the Middle East  When we can't run  Two parties together  Oh  I didn't hear that  I didn't hear that  Pearl of wisdom  Pearl of wisdom  I'm glad somebody  Had the guts to say it  Hey Colin  We got a wide open slate today  I say  Screw  You put your pajama pants on  And come down  Yeah  Come down like a crazy person  Yeah who gives a crap  About your script today 
[00:37:30]  It's Friday  A couple hours  Why don't you come hang out  With the boys  For an hour  You're blocks away  Oh no no no  Come down for an hour  Alright  Alright  You guys want me to bring anything  Muffins  Just your charming self  Yes  Comb your hair  I'll come for an hour  Alright good  Bye guys  Bye  There you go  That was easy  Colin Quinn's stopping it today  He's never busy  But back to the  But back to the Pacino De Niro movie  Of course  There's going to be a lot more chatter about 
[00:38:00]  Yes  How do we not talk about that  Well that's what we do  You know as soon as Colin sits down  Then it's all about Turk and Rooster  Right in front of his face  Until he goes insane  There'll be one moment  That he gets caught up in  Let me play the trailer for everybody  This is all we're talking about  Righteous Kill  The trailer  Academy Award winner Robert De Niro  And Academy Award winner Al Pacino  Who made the decision to enter at that time  I did  Whose decision was it  Mine  The two greatest actors of a generation  I mentioned daylight between them 
[00:38:30]  They're like Lyndon and McCartney  The movie event we've been waiting for  Am I a suspect here all the time  If you don't back it  You will regret it  I need to know who I can count on  Whatever happens  I'm not taking it down with me  Righteous Kill  Rated R  Starts Friday  That's not an awful trailer  No it doesn't really  Just the part  Convey the douchiness  The event we've all been waiting for  I guess we have been waiting for that  They should have done this  About ten years ago right  Yeah that was not right  Pacino was not awful  But De Niro was just 
[00:39:00]  And when you hear them  We heard the top ten list  Which we heard  It was actually pretty funny  But De Niro's delivery  And this is a guy  Who knows how to deliver  Comedy lines ironically  Yeah  To make them bad  He does it badly in this  Yeah he's not very good at it  It doesn't seem like  He understands  Where the inflection goes  Where the little delay maybe  Or an accent on something  It's like why are you  So uncomfortable talking  Yeah  You've been talking in front of people  Since 1972 
[00:39:30]  How have you not gotten  The hang of it yet  The one thing also  That was just so  This movie seems like  Complete cliches  Like just full of cliches  And the opening scene  Is at the cop shooting range  Where they both have  Their pistols out  And it's the front view  Just boom boom boom  With the you know  The ear protection  And eye protection on  How many times  Has that been done  Six  Exactly six 
[00:40:00]  Yes  Little picture  The little remarks  They make to each other  Yeah good shooting  Yeah  Right down the middle  Do they bring the targets back  And see I just  I gotta  I gotta see this  Now I have to  Just for the douchiness  For the complete douchiness  It's horrendous  And it's getting on  Rotten Tomatoes  Better than I thought  Really  What is it up to  27%  27%  Alright  20% of that's generosity  Alright  There's a movie 
[00:40:30]  Getting worse reviews  A movie called  The Woman  The Women  Has 6% positive reviews  On RottenTomatoes.com  By the way  Pierce Mark  Wants to remind us  That Turk and Rooster  Replaced us  In Grand Rapids, Michigan  Not Turk and Rooster  Damn it  They took our place  In Grand Rapids, Michigan  I forgot  Turk and Rooster with ya  In the morning  In the morning  We got the Q and the D  Coming up  In between two for

[00:42:00]  92-3  Yes  90-second caller  But he would go  Shouldn't it be  92-second  Point-3 caller  Ha ha ha  Ah Turk  You're a loose cannon  We need a hole  For the show  Oof  There's a hole  For the show  They just bring the script  This review's not good 
[00:42:30]  Al Pacino and Robert De Niro  Collect bloated paychecks  With intent to bore  And righteous kill  That's how that review starts  Intent to bore  Yeah  A slow moving  Ridiculous police thriller  That would have been  Shipped straight to  Blockbuster  MSNBC said  Compared to 88 minutes  Pacino's previous  Collaboration with  Director John Avnet  It's a work of art  But the movie is so  Dreadfully by the numbers  And predictable  That comparing it to  TV cop show  Would be an insult  To TV cop shows  I'm annoyed we don't 
[00:43:00]  Get guys like this  On the show  Yeah  We would be very nice  About this movie  Oh yeah  We would change our tune  If there was  Sitting right there  De Niro and Pacino  Sitting in that seat  Right there  We would just be  This  We saw the movie  Just gotta say  Fantastic  Action packed  Roland  Why don't you tell them  Action  Suspense  We've played that game  A few times  Oh yeah  Guy Ritchie  We helped him out  Yeah  With his bomb  Who else did we help out  With their bomb  Will 
[00:43:30]  Willem  Willem Dafoe  Yeah  We're never gonna get  Willem Dafoe  Mike Myers  We blatantly lie  When we have  We just want the audience  To know  We blatantly lie  When we have the  Celebrities here in the studio  It's about time  We acknowledge that  Yeah  You know  Don't see Riley  Well no we do  We purposely don't see  The movie ahead of time  If we know it's gonna be a bomb  So then we're kinda safe  Yeah  Kinda safe about it  Like well we're gonna go  When it opens  We didn't see the preview  Damn it  Yeah  You know they didn't send us a screener  How many times have we said  This is one we're looking forward to 
[00:44:00]  Yeah this one looks really good  I can't wait  I'm gonna go this weekend  Yeah  The Oscar winning actors  Who with each passing year  Are looking more and more like  Money grubbing has-beens  Wow  Yeah the reviews are not kind  Is that the Opie and Anthony show  Well  What are they  Who said that  Francis Ford Coppola  He gave him another beating I think  Oh yeah  Did he say something else  About this movie  No but he did say that they  They're not their former selves 
[00:44:30]  He went after Pacino  Big time  Yeah  When was this  Because he did that a while ago  Is this it again  Today  Today  In Russian Malloy  Oh it's in Russian Malloy  But I think the statement he made  Was a while ago  But they were asking Pacino  And De Niro  About what Coppola said  Yeah  And they didn't want to answer  They didn't want to bad mouth him  Yeah  Well Coppola said  I met both Pacino and De Niro  When they were really on the come  Mm-mm  What?  Mm-mm  What?  Old school  Really? 
[00:45:00]  I know it means on the up and up  But maybe they should have said  Sounds a little different  Maybe he should have said  When they were on the up and up  Yeah  Yeah  I've never heard it put that way before  No  Yeah  Someone else was on the  Yesterday  When we  With  You know who  Yeah  They were young and insecure  Now Pacino is very rich  Maybe because he never spends any money  He just puts it in his mattress  I don't feel  That kind of passion  To do a role  And be great  Coming from those guys  Hmm  Yeah so  He's kind of disappointed 
[00:45:30]  In what those two have become  Yeah  It's  Like we said  You do kind of become a caricature  Of  Of  The person you were  And they  That's what they are now  It's just this weird  Horrendous  Yeah  It's not Goodfellas anymore  You know  Or The Godfather  It's  Ah  And  Turk and Rooster  Why don't we take a break  When we come back  We got Al and  And Bobby  Doing the top ten list

[00:54:30]  Why?  Pretty good  Sorry Ron the producer  Yeah whatever Ron  Sorry Ron  That's all you get today  I'm figuring this out though  Colin played De Niro back in the day  Yes he did  So maybe there's a little jealousy  That's true  You're now playing De Niro  Speaking of Duke  Get on the block  And Ron  You know Ron's from  Nicobaca Village  Where the whole  Lefty  Ruggiero  And all those guys  Are from  Oh really?  From Donnie Brasco  That's where they're from  From where Ron's from 
[00:55:00]  Oh yeah?  He's probably not allowed  To talk about it  Yeah yeah  It's not really a  Hot topic  Oh it's as hot as  Alright that's what  What else is going on?

[00:56:00]  Hey uh  The best part about this  Letterman's top ten  With Al Pacino  And Bobby  Bobby De Niro  This is Letterman's?  Yeah but listen to Letterman  Trying to pump this up  They do it from a remote  In two big leather chairs  Oh really?  Yeah yeah  They're not in studio  They're on some weird  But Letterman knows this sucks  And he's trying to pump  You know pump it up a bit  Kind of like how you're trying  To pump up our show right now  Don't forgive him  Go ahead let's hear  I can't believe  There's actually a top ten for this  Even Letterman's upset  Top ten reasons I like being an actor  Here we go 
[00:56:30]  Number ten  Sometimes when I go to the movies  The popcorn guy  Will give me a free squirt  Of chemical butter  Chemical butter  I'm sick of that  Go ahead  Midwestern  Chemical butter  The popcorn guy  All right let's drop it  Chemical butter  I believe the person  Was killed from chemical butter  What do you think Turk?  You ever try to get  A free squirt of butter  With the movies  In reality 
[00:57:00]  Not in 1950s America  What you want?  The bottom line is  All butter is free  Excuse me miss  Because you just carry it over  And you can hit as many pumps  Of course you can  As butter as you want  Because keep hitting the pump  Don't  Excuse me miss  Can I have butter?  Butter's over there  Exactly  Exactly  Oh my god  Excuse me  Either Fred Berry  Or Nell  From Nell Carter  I can't tell  You're just fat  And miserable  Personified  Chemical butter 
[00:57:30]  Chemical butter  Number nine  Every time I go to work  I get to ask myself  I wonder if I'll see  Harvey Keitel naked  Yeah  He stole that  From my roast of him  Yeah  Go ahead  Go ahead  He didn't write it  Do you think De Niro  Did writing?  I have to write  He didn't look at it  Before it was on the monitor  Well somebody else did then  That was the line you used? 
[00:58:00]  Uh huh  Of the many that ruined that party  The lucky man  Top ten reasons I like being an actor  Number eight  Well you gotta keep honing your craft  Or you could end up  Out of the business  And taking a job  As governor of California  Yes exactly  That's right  I'll tell you that's edgy  Yeah that's timely too  Yeah  Number seven 
[00:58:30]  If you do a scene  Where you're eating pudding  They often let you  Keep the pudding  Funny in a  Kind of offbeat way  Colin rolled his eyes  He didn't like that one  I'm gonna commit suicide  If you keep playing these  They let you keep the pudding  I like the pudding one  Why?  Pudding  They often let you keep it  Not all  Often  That made the joke  It was corny  Well yeah of course  Yeah  Still funny  Well you can't argue with that  Can't beat that  Number six  I got to meet 
[00:59:00]  Spider-Man  Spider-Man  He got to meet  Spider-Man  Happy fun  Spider-Man stinks  And I don't like him  Now that was a performance  Wait till you see  I got to meet  Spider-Man  He was a good fella  A good fella  I get it  They called us good fellas  There's a good  There's a  Pacino does one  And then De Niro does one 
[00:59:30]  And De Niro's delivery  It is exactly  Like late for supper  Just inflection awful  Number five  It's the makeup  I like wearing the makeup  Reasons I like being an actor  Number four  We'll get to make films  For personal reasons  I made Righteous Kill  To let people know  I'm still alive  Good idea  Get the movie name in there 
[01:00:00]  Number three  I get to make films  For personal reasons  I made Righteous Kill  To see if Al was still alive  That's right  If Al was still alive  When was this still alive?  Yeah  Perfect delivery  If Al was still alive  Yeah  I made Righteous Kill  To see if Al was still alive  Yeah  That's where you have to  Put the inflection  How does a guy  Who's been talking  Other people's words  For 37 years  Not know that  To see if Al was  And then he realized  That there's no joke 
[01:00:30]  And he just threw on it  At the end  A little inflection  If Al was still alive  If Al was still alive  Ass  Still alive  How does he get dialogue?  He forced me to make a comeback  How does he get  Exactly  How does he get  Like dialogue so good  And like a written joke  So terribly  This is the same guy  In The Godfather 2  Is it?  Is it?  Same guy from Taxi Driver  Is this what we're looking at?  Yeah  What happens?  Yeah  You're a boy 
[01:01:00]  I know  Sierra Mountain  Is drinking champagne  While you drink  Champagne cocktails  Get you a party  Okay  That's right  Jesus  So the power of the storm  Yeah  Exactly  Number 2  Beats my old gig  As a hockey mom  What?

[01:01:30]  No more of this  Ironic distance  Before I kill somebody  Starting with that nonsense  Jim is so used to me  Ranting like this  I don't disagree  And the number one reason  I like being an actor  Get to read  Well crafted dialogue  Like get the  F*** out of here  Yeah exactly  Right?  See that wouldn't be funny  But it's edgy  To say that F word  On TV  Yes  Then you gotta beep it  Whoa  Watch out 
[01:02:00]  Hey you pass  Obama on the way  Over here Colin  Obama  No way  Where was he?  He's literally a block away  He's staying at the  We just found out  That Obama  Is that what I saw  Those police lights  Yes  He's at the  Park of Meridian  All hell's breaking loose  About a block away  From here  Because we found out  Obama is  Literally  I mean you could  Almost see  You know  The police presence  Outside this window  A block away  Yeah  He's a show  He's got SNL tomorrow  I saw a guy running  Was that him?  Being pursued by an undercover  By a Plymouth Fury 
[01:02:30]  Could be  Plymouth Fury  What year is it?  That's what they chased you in  In like the 60s  That's right  The 70s  And we got kind of a  Sixth degree of separation here  Because we just learned  That the place that  Obama's staying at  Is a place that  Anthony likes to stay at  And because there wasn't  A room available one time  When Mr. Kumey  Was checking in  He got a fine  Presidential sweep  I got the presidential  That's where Obama's staying  So technically  Anthony has now  Officially slept  In the same bed as Obama  Not only slept 
[01:03:00]  How do you like that Colin?  How do you like me now?  Had sexual relations  But not only that  With Obama  But he's gonna actually  Anthony if he was there now  He'd be like that  Like those Aryan  Meth heads  He'd be sitting in  And he's down the hall from me  And those guys  Who all met that  Down the hall from me  Down the hall  Like they thought  He was on the same floor  Anthony be sitting  With all his guns  On the bed  He's down the hall  But Kenny came in  With the news  All excited  Is Kenny here?

That's what I was told  Yes  By some certain people?  Certain people in the know  Yes  And the presence out there  Is pretty crazy right?  Yes  There's NYPD command posts  And there's a lot of  Secret service  Oh  Not so secret now 
[01:04:30]  Nope  I just wrote a John Deere  A block here  Like 6.30 in the morning  One of my maintenance guys  Had a John Deere tractor  I jumped on  He started driving down the street  He's a funny thing  He ever saw  Little baby John Deere  You can take that over  And show them about our  Yeah  I'll say what are you talking  About our guns and religion  We're going to do it more  Why don't we take the John Deere  And see how close  We can get to that hotel  I think the one thing  You couldn't get close to  Was with the John Deere  No  Yeah exactly  Hey damn  Let me go see  What's going on down there  Who's that  Are you kidding me  Right here

[01:05:30]  Before they're turned around  How close do you think  They would get there Kenny  Well I think  A certain member  From this radio show  Is familiar with that hotel  So he probably knows  I already said all that  I could probably get a room  He's had assignations there  Holy jeez  What happened  That's a big word  Alright let's move on  You think he'll be  Way to know the listeners  A nice burger joint in there  There's a big word like that  I think he'll go in there  Yeah get a burger downstairs 
[01:06:00]  Yeah sit down  Secret service  Yeah you gotta go in there  And do that  Is that a 40  Is that a 38  Yeah what do you got there  How do you become secret service  That's good  Just waiting for the senator  Oh yeah that's good  Yeah  Just waiting  It's a social security number  He gives the wrong amount of numbers  Yeah  Oh that's my  That's my social security  Yeah  I was thinking of my phone number  Oh my phone number  That's seven number  And that's all you got Kenny  I thought you had more on this thing 
[01:06:30]  I thought something  He thought you had something  Yeah  Anything  Isn't he terrific  Terrific  That's terrific  Big and stupid  What'd you expect from me  It's terrific  Big and stupid  He made a lot of money too  It's terrific  Yeah  Salud Tommy  He was terrific  He'd make him shine like mirrors  Excuse my language  Oh yeah  He was terrific  Like mirrors  That's how he makes  He was terrific  He was terrific 
[01:07:00]  Oh he's terrific  Travis is insane  Travis suggests we send someone out  With a sign like in Die Hard 3  Oh my god  What is wrong with you  What's the sign  Oh boy  Well they made Bruce Willis  Go uptown  With a sign around his neck  That said something about  I hate  Was it I hate  Yes  Yeah  I hate  And then the ominous N word  Yeah  Yeah they sent him uptown  That was their idea of edgy  Ethnic  Oh yeah  A lot of controversy 
[01:07:30]  When a movie hit  When it's on regular TV  Where they destroy all movies  They pixelate that  It says I hate Nipsey Russell  And then it says in quotes underneath  You fill in the blank  Obviously what I mean  It says I hate Nipsey Russell  And 30 million more  Jesus Christ  I'm just trying to piggyback on Jimmy's joke  Of course  I hear you  Colin Quinn in studio  A lot of excitement  Obama's a block away  We need to do something  To get our faces in the news 
[01:08:00]  That's what I'm thinking  That's probably a bad way  Yeah because it's  Well we're not doing the sign thing  You never wind up in the news  When it's a presidential candidate  In a good way  Yeah yeah  It's never good  Why don't you make him come on the show  We were trying to get him on this  You won't come on the show  Yeah you won't come on  No make him do it  Why  He's afraid of our tough questions  We won't see him no more  It would be smart  If he came on  And did a little walk through  Maybe we should get the creepy new intern  To go see how close  Oh yeah  Oh Stephen Hawking's  Without the chair  Wow we got it  We got it  We got a new creep

[01:18:30]  I know  Horrid  It almost makes you admire whoever the director was  He's like listen  This movie's not Schindler's List  We're just trying to hit everybody that hates you people  So soup it up a little Judd  Yeah come on Judd  And he goes there's an extra 50 in it for you  Really get Jewy on us could you  Yeah  Hey  I took a picture of our new intern David  It's up on ondayradio.com  I had to see him you know preparing for his sports report  Walked into the office and there he is sitting at my desk 
[01:19:00]  Ah he's sitting at your desk  Look at that  That's it  Look at that  Mother effer  No good deed goes unpunished  You give him a break and he starts to take it on  That's it  And isn't that just like them in some ways  At least that's what people say in my meetings  It was an open seat  So I took it  Why he's not using it  If after the show he's using it I get up  He's inside  What am I chopped liver  There's actually a picture in Anthony's trophy room 
[01:19:30]  Of an old  Trophy room  Of an old SS general with David's grandfather  Oh Jesus  I would never  I'm a fan of the era  The entire era  David's going to be here in a few minutes  You never heard that one before  Let's do the Nazi story  And then it rolls perfectly  Oh does it  Jesus  Well a lot of Jewish people are 
[01:20:00]  Yes a lot of Jewish people are upset  Rather have the Treaty of Versailles rolled perfectly  Into Nazi Germany  The Treaty of Versailles  Yeah  We'll segue from that into a blitzkrieg  Yeah  How Kristallnacht  Segwayed perfectly  Yeah join us for Kristallnacht  On the Turk and Rooster show  Come for the Kristallnacht  Stay for the extermination  Whoa whoa whoa what  Holy Jesus 
[01:20:30]  What's wrong with you guys  Is this Colin Quinn  He's been in mainstream movies  What the hell is going on  We're just having fun man  You had to take it over the top like that  Yeah  What's wrong with you  Anything to get away from  Pacino and De Niro  Oh you mean  Turk and Rooster  Turk and Rooster  It's the Turk and Rooster show  Turk and Rooster  Yeah Turk and Rooster  Yeah  Turk and Rooster in the morning  We got promos 
[01:21:00]  Do a morning show  Don't get to sleep  Norton's been awfully quiet today  And I don't like it  Why I'm tired Carl  My sleep  It's creepy  Oh my sleep has been topsy-turvy  Don't get me going  Did you scrap thinking of Bree  Oh good question  Before I got home  Columbus Circle  Angrily staring in traffic  His car skidding  Of course I did  Hitting a slick  Yeah  How could you not  Yeah  It's the Turk  Oh Turk  You're a loose cannon  Rooster show  There you go 
[01:21:30]  No Rooster  Oh God  Stop it  No we're not  No we can't  Colin is so upset with this  We can't stop  Hey  If he really thinks  That he has a connection with De Niro  We're going to spoil it  Ah going to ruin it  No that's not  Shut up  We got the Nazi story  Let's play this Anthony  They're trying to rename  That fine stadium down there  In Jersey  Oh yeah  Listen to this  Construction trucks rolled today  At the new Giants and Jets stadium  But before the thing is even built 
[01:22:00]  There is controversy  Should a company with Nazi ties in the past  Have the right to name the stadium?  I just disagree with it  Totally  I don't think that that's right  The company that wants its name here  Is Allianz  Back during World War II  It was the largest insurance company in Germany  They insured the concentration camp Auschwitz  They insured that  They carried a lot of insurance policies of Jews who died  And they denied paying out to their survivors  I'm from a Holocaust insurance company 
[01:22:30]  A walla walla Washington  You need insurance  What the hell kind of insurance does a concentration camp get?  That is  Alliance insurance  It's kind of  I don't know  They make it sound like there's going to be a big logo  A big swastika  A big swastika on the stadium  Yeah  It's going to look like Nuremberg in 38 or something  It's just  I mean  They want you to file into the stadium a certain way  Yes of course 
[01:23:00]  Every Sunday  Yeah  Oof  I wish Voss was here to  Right now he'd jump in and try to make a point  You know  You know  They didn't give payouts  A lot of stolen artwork  Here's the thing  There is no thing  I heard that new stadium is beautiful  But I heard when they tell you to hit the showers  Forget about it  Just don't  Since then the company has made restitution  Today it's involved in banking, insurance, asset management  With thousands of employees  It's headquartered in Munich 
[01:23:30]  The company sponsors various sporting events  The company was willing to put up big bucks  To slap its name on the new stadium  Reportedly 20 to 30 million dollars per year  But there are those who say  There is no price high enough  To erase the company's past  I'm sure  Giants and Jets would not have  A problem finding another sponsor  The Yankees could do it  They already have those pinstripes  Like the old  Whoa  Why don't they just  Yeah and rename Yankee Stadium that 
[01:24:00]  Oh  A lot of controversy  What do you think?  He just got a base Hitler  Thank God we have a Jewish sports reporter  They handle this  Yes  What do you think is going to happen?  I think they'll bow to the pressure  And not be able to put their name on it  Even though  I mean  People drive Volkswagens  Volkswagen was  Yeah Mercedes  Supplier of motor vehicles to Nazis  And how about Mitsubishi?  People buy those  They built zeros  That killed many people  The Japanese 
[01:24:30]  If you're an insurance company  What are you going to tell Hitler?  We're not going to carry your policy?  Sorry Hitler  Yeah  And meanwhile  Brendan Byrne was the biggest Nazi of them all  In my opinion  Brendan Byrne  Brendan Byrne Arena  I'm old  Old school  Oh Jimmy you alright?  Oh I've been better  I've been better  Alright  Yeah that's a little silly  I mean  Kenny how's your  World War 2 date  How's your protege?  Kenny's helping young David write the  Stereotypical Jew sports report  He's a remarkable young lad 
[01:25:00]  And I think you'll be pleased  Yeah  Is he almost ready?  We're about halfway there  Halfway there  Alright we'll do it  During the next break  We'll do it the next break  All you need is love  John Lennon said that  Right after the next break  Man shot him in the back  Oh ew  Is that from Independence Day?  Of course  Ech  He goes  I still see love there  It's true  And then the woman kind of looks  And goes you know  Well  And she goes  All you need is love  John Lennon said that  He was killed 
[01:25:30]  Man shot him in the back  I don't know why  How do you remember that?  Why is that so horrible?  It's annoying  I've seen Independence Day  8 billion times  I've seen it once  I fall asleep to the same movies  Over and over again  Because if I put a new movie on  Then I'm going to be caught up in it  So I put on the same 5 movies  Gladiator  Alien  Or Aliens  Oh I wouldn't watch that  Before I went to bed  I have nightmares  Scary  Ant needs a TV on  Independence Day  When he falls asleep  And now the prestige 
[01:26:00]  That's what it is  He doesn't want to confront himself  No  Who wants to?  You lay there with your own mind?  Stop  Staring at the ceiling  With horrific things  Going through your head  So instead you have aliens running?  Yeah it's cool  Yeah we're doomed  It's great  Gladiator  It's fantastic  Who's this from?  Are you crazy?  What?  You know how you said  Blank and the Mad Dog?  Why do you  It's beeped  Alright  Oh boy  I wouldn't play this 
[01:26:30]  Without pre-listening to it  Well get ready on the dump button  That's what I do  We take chances on this show  Who gives a crap  We have enough money  No we don't  No we don't  It's like someone's spending a little  Yeah I bought a nice house  Out on Long Island  And I had a yard done  I bet Anthony's house  Has like a Houdini  Like secret trap doors  And stuff  Dude  It's the best  Dude  I got a defense closet  Look at Anthony  On the beep button  I'm on the dump button  I'm ready to shut this show down

[01:29:00]  It was a fitting  Where were you  It was just the kind of show  He would have watched too  It's like the part of the age  I loved remote control  I really loved it  You know our own Tim  Was on remote control  Really  And so was Earl  Showing equipment  Yeah Tim has a remote control story  Tim was on remote control  And so was Earl  You know the guy  Black Earl  The guy that does the  Oh no  Yeah  We haven't had that on the show in a while  But that guy was on remote control  I saw the clip  And he won  He won  He won one of those crappy cars

[01:30:30]  I put in  One of the letters  I can't listen  It was in Spanish  So she had to figure it out  But it was the name  Of an Aussie album  What was it?  Speak of the devil  So whatever that quote is  Something like  Habla  Diablo  Diablo  Habla Diablo  I believe you  Whatever you say  Wow  Well you tried to  But why would you put a quote  Speak of the devil 
[01:31:00]  That was the name of his album  But why would you put that  As a quote  Significant to her  Is what I mean  She would know it was me  But I didn't want to say it was me  Right but would you pick something  A little more romantic  Why are you asking me now  Like I should logically  Have gone through this  Why would I walk by  Playing Iron Man  Thinking she'd run out  And fall in love with me  Just imagine her  Just imagine her crestfallen face  With her scarf  When she goes  Oh no  It's you  Oh no  I never told her  The QB from the football team  Look at Colin  Yeah why are we talking about that  When we got video of Colin  Playing from remote control  Back in 1989

[01:47:30]  Oh yeah let's hear that clip  Judd Hirsch  From Independence Day  Taking it a little over the top  As the Jewish dad  Of uh  What's his name there  Yeah  Jeff Goldberg  Jeff Goldberg  I didn't get a chance  To thank you two  All he can think of  Was getting to you  There's still love there  I think  Love was never a problem  All you need is love  John Lennon  Smart man  Shot in the back  Very sad  Shot in the back

[01:49:00]  Propaganda footage  That Goebbels put out  Right  Old posters  Oh  That is a little over the top there Judd  Yeah  But I like the way that they showed  That the blacks and Jews  Could work together  That was a cool message there  I thought  Oh when they  About Will Smith and Jeff  Well that was good  They've been trying to push that message  For 50 years  Yeah  That was a good one though  I think that that kind of resonated  And then when the Israeli Air Force  Is getting ready for the raid 
[01:49:30]  When they bring the shields down on the ship  And one of the Egyptian guys  Come in  A pilot  And starts talking to them  And they're all pals  I like that  Everyone  The Russians are in it  The Japanese  Everybody  The Koreans  No  The only bad people are  White males  Right  That's right  Exactly  Christian white males  The great evil  Bad  Society and media  Bad people  Everything  Look I bet one's driving this car right here  Oh I guess not  Gee I was wrong 
[01:50:00]  I just saw a car chase  And someone got out  And oh what a surprise  Pretty impressive video though  Oh that is a good one  He's driving against traffic for a little bit  He was doing real life Grand Theft Auto  Oh yeah  He's driving against traffic on the highway  Just jumps out of his car  Starts running  Yeah  I got like three stars on me  Yes they caught him  Oh readily  But he's in Dutch  I think they tased him too  Yeah they did tase him  Yeah they tased him  He got a good tasing  Where was that?

Josh  Hey morning my boys  Good morning Josh  Hey  I think you should make David wear those pantses  Like all the Jews in bed for style and nice  Over there  And what not  Oh that's the beauty of radio  You can picture what  You know David looks like  When he does the kosher sports  Yeah  Oh but without  I though  We don't have much of a budget  As far as you know  I know  So we're not putting up  Just putting up  On people  You pick up the latest copy  Of Judenrat  And that'll give you  Whatever  Make them grow pay us though 
[01:51:00]  That would be kind of funny  If we make them grow pay us  And wear one of the hats  Not a yarmulke  One of the big like hats  Yeah that could be funny  Or it could also be considered  Tantamount to  Some kind of a hate crime  I was going to say  Maybe you guys don't remember  You were talking about it yesterday  Remember the St. Patrick's Cathedral thing  Well yeah  The shul incident  The shul incident  We're just very excited 
[01:51:30]  We like David  We feel like we have a  We feel like we have a really  Strong bit fight  I love that bit  And you know what  We haven't had a strong bit in a while  We're bringing other  Ethnic backgrounds to our show  That's good  40 minutes into it  Let's tie it up nicely  Like this is why we're doing it  For higher  Because that's the clip  They'll play on the news  Diversity  Is what this show is about  As we sit here  All white men  Looking at a picture of John Cena  Yes  Yes  Diversity  Is our goal  Here on the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:52:00]  Whether it's  White men  We want diversity  Whether it's tall white men  Or short white men  Fat white men  Or thin white men  You guys are about as diverse  As a ski lift  Oh  A lot of white men on those  That's stupid  Because the ski lifts  Are not diverse at all  Oh you  I knew there was something  Wrong with that bit  But until you pointed out 
[01:52:30]  I wasn't sure  Look at Gene Shallot  Did I ever tell you  When I used to drink  A hundred years ago  Gene Shallot  Was once at a bar  Was sitting with a girl  And I walked in there  Midtown  And I was trying to be like  Mr. Manhattan  I thought I was going to be an actor  But I was a drunken fool  And I woke up to the table  And I go  Hey  How you doing  Whore  To the guy  To Gene Shallot  And I go  And he's going  Wait out wait out  I go  You're a whore  You told me to see  Police Academy  And that movie stunk  You whore  Give me my money back  You said that to him  And they had to drag me out  Yeah

[01:54:00]  Oh my goodness  You have a guy screening a call  Yes but we don't  When the guy screams  He's how it works  We don't know exactly  What you're going to say  We just know  We got a complaint  There's always a party pooper  Colin  Look how sad we're getting now  What's the matter  I'm not a party pooper  Listen I think it's funny  Are you of the Jewish persuasion sir  I'm sorry  Are you of the Jewish persuasion  Yes he's Israeli  You're very oversensitive  No but he's got a point  Let me just explain  I'm not oversensitive  I thought that was very funny  The whole bit  But  But you're mad about the caller  He's afraid that people  Are going to take it  In an ugly direction 
[01:54:30]  We like David  I got it  But the guy who called up sir  Is the guy who called up  We can't stop a guy  From calling up  I didn't know what he was  I didn't know what he was  Well he's right  You're being disingenuous  We like our David  Stop it  I like our David too  Stop it  We like David  Alright then  Alright then  Say hi to the boys  Okay bye  Alright  The boys  The boys  The boys  I  That camera store  B&H  Oh  You know something  I went there once  Love that place  And I was shocked

[01:56:30]  As a Jew  And it's really mad  I'm totally proud of the bid you guys did  And David rocks  Yeah  Thank you  We learned something about the Ascidics today  It's in the paper  Some hot broad is on a bicycle  On one of Bloomberg's bike paths  Yeah  And everyone's outraged  Because they're driving through the neighborhood  And the guys aren't allowed to look at that  Nah they can't look at like  The scantily clad girls on bicycles  Yeah look at this  Yeah see she's riding by on the bike 
[01:57:00]  Culture clash over sexy cyclists  There's like a Hasidic Jew walking behind her  And he's got to turn his head  He turned his head away from her  Which he  Yeah which he's doing just that  He's averting his eyes  And then the woman is looking at her like  Oh she's disgusted  She looks like  Disgusted  She looks like Carol Burnett  When Carol Burnett used to dress up as the  Oh the old cleaning lady  The old cleaning lady  That's the woman that's looking at the cyclist  In disgust  It's a great picture  We'll have to get that up on  O&A Radio.com  How about Fruity Bloomberg  Stops with the bike paths 
[01:57:30]  Yeah enough  Stop  Every road has been cut down in half  That's good  It's not good because I drive  This jackass  It's not a park  It's a major city  It's a city  You see what he did in Times Square  Where he made a little place to sit  And have a coffee  Yeah  There's seats  It's in the middle  Of Times Square  You're right  Thank you  Oh pedestrians suck  I'm bringing the city into the  Out of my way  Sorry we don't want to be a mini mall  You suburban drone  Out of my way  I'm driving  Coffee in December outside 
[01:58:00]  All that area is going to be a waste  Wasted lanes  No it's not going to be a lovely place  For the homeless people to sit and harass you  That's true  That's dope  It's perfect if you walk around this city  He's an idiot  The guy doesn't live  He doesn't have to live  He doesn't have to live  In New York  Like working people  Have to live in New York  And people that live here  And commute  Whatever  He's ushered around  By security  Or he takes his bike  Across the bridge  Or something  Every so often  With 20 people around him  Why don't you admit one thing  Yes  And I'm not even joking 
[01:58:30]  He actually  Started that silly smoking thing  And the entire  He changed the whole world  Dublin  Paris  None of them smoke anymore  They started all that in LA  Bloomberg didn't start that  No they didn't  I was in LA at the time  I thought Bloomberg was the first  Bloomberg was the first one to me  Jim  You're right  Go ahead  That whole thing came from LA  Rob Ryan  Pushed it so hard  No just because you watch South Park  You think Rob Ryan  I don't watch South Park  Shut up  That's what it's from  I don't watch that  Really  Well I do  It's quite an amusing episode 
[01:59:00]  They really nailed him  But you're right  I mean he kind of started there  But officially as a law  Became the New York  And then Paris  I mean that's pretty amazing  Everyone was so upset  And up in arms  When that happened  And then it turned out like  Wow you could go to the bar  You hang out  And you don't go home and go  Oh god  Your laundry would just stink  Like smoke  It's crazy  I love it now  Get outside and smoke  Get out and smoke  That was Bloomberg  And I like the bike idea  I mean Jim is technically

[02:01:30]  Yeah I mean I like her personally  But I don't like her opinions really on anything  Yeah  I like her opinions on guns  I really do hate  Yeah me too  Yeah  Well you'd love that to be in a helicopter  Tracing  You know  Tracing wolves  Shooting them  Tracer rounds  Yeah  RPGs  Whatever it takes to bring down a moose  Yeah  But um  Yeah I mean you know  It's hard because I hate  I really have to say  I feel like there's both of these parties  There's nothing that they combine on  The way you agree  I wish there was a third party  At this point  Yeah  Yeah 
[02:02:00]  Ron Paul  Ron Paul  Ron Paul  Ron Paul  Ron Paul  I still see those signs popping up everywhere  They're still trying  That ain't gonna wash  Yeah  You gotta go McCain though right  You know  Right now  But I mean I don't know man  I don't know  I really feel confused  I mean let's be honest  Of the Republicans  If everyone deserves a time out  After the past few years  That's true  Is it the whole party though  Or is it the you know  Is it the George Bush  Well I don't know  But I'm just saying  It's like 
[02:02:30]  I don't know man  It's just very tough  It's all of them  Is it  Yeah  Just clean house  The Democrats  I heard Norton once again  Misidentifying the radio thing  The other day  Saying like the  What they've done the radio  But it's also  The Democrats  Oh I know  I'm saying both parties  But I'm just screaming  About the Democrats  I know  I know  I'm saying  I'm saying with the fines  It's both parties  This is what I'm saying  I hate  I hate the way it works right now  You know  I wish there was another party  Yeah  A real one  Not one of these goofy  Frigging  Ralph Nader  It's crazy  Right  I'm like 
[02:03:00]  Three day weekends  Like Pat Buchanan  Bring back the wig  Pat Buchanan was good  Let's bring back the wig  Chicken in every pot  Yeah  That was a good slogan  Three day weekends  Jim's a party party  Yeah  Three day weekends  Everyone's cheering  In high school  Yeah  You work from 8 in the morning  Till 9 in the morning  Go home  Proposition 420  Broco  Dude  Dude  Smoke to join  Yeah  It's just at the point 
[02:03:30]  Where you don't know  Which goof ticket  To vote for  It's really embarrassing  It's like  Nobody agrees with  Anybody that agrees  With 100%  Or more extreme  Of either party  It just makes me sick  But there's a lot of people  That are like that  Nothing gets done though  In this day and age  Because no one wants to  Agree with any legislation  That the Democrats  Come up with  If they're Republican  And vice versa  I know  But it's like  It just drives me nuts  I was reading some  Leftist people  The other day  And they're like  Yeah man  Because the media  Is so conservative 
[02:04:00]  And I was like  What  How am I ever  Going to agree with you  If you won't admit  The media  Fox  Fox  Yeah Fox  Oh Fox  Okay  Yeah but they  Pointed one  Out of all  You know  Just in the one's  I don't see  What's going to happen here  Yeah  Very weird situation  I think McCain will win  You do  I bet  I bet $100  With Opie  And who else  I disagree  I'm in with  I'm in with Jimmy  He's not thinking  He's hoping  No no 
[02:04:30]  I really think  McCain's going to win  Because when push  Comes to shove  In this country  Yes his arms  Are not affected  I think  That people  Are more willing  To elect  A female vice president  Than a black president  I just think  That's the way  This country's mindset  Is right now  I think that's not true  Really  Are you kidding me  Look at all those  White states  I do respect  What are you kidding me  What are you kidding me  Or what  What are you kidding me  But look at all those  White states  Everybody's like  Obama  People secretly 
[02:05:00]  They all voted  For Idaho  All the white states  Caucus people  What's that  Vermont  Yeah in Vermont  They voted for him  And everything  Caucus people  These caucus people  Caucus  But he's also got  Let's be honest  I've never met  A black guy  With a more boring personality  Oh I know  He's got like  A white accountant personality  It's that wife  You gotta watch  Yeah  She's a loose cannon  No you didn't  The fist bump  I hate her little mouth  She makes her little mouth  Thing 
[02:05:30]  That's all you hate about her  I wouldn't want to  Let's be honest  I wouldn't want to  Be on her line  At the DMV  Hey we got  Pam Anderson  You gotta have  The other authorization  We got Pam Anderson  Speaking out about  Palin  So thank god  Pam is finally talking  It's interesting to hear  The celebrities  Are really going  At the conservatives  Which is odd  Well Matt Damon  Was trashing  Sarah Palin  It's all over  YouTube  That guy's edgy man  And now you got  Pam Anderson  This is what she had to say  So you know Sarah Palin  Is the deeply candidate 
[02:06:00]  For the Republicans  In the US  Where you currently reside  Now I don't know  If you've seen  The recent Newsweek article  With her  But she has a gigantic  Bear hide  In her office  Or house  And the head  Is almost bigger  Than her body  She can suck it  Ha ha  Quote me  Wow  I can't stand her  She can suck it  That sounds like  That sounds like  Idiocracy  Suck it  Did you see  Idiocracy  Let's do this one  So there you go  Yes I did see that  It was funnier  Than people gave it  Credit for  It was really funny

Oh just nothing but chit chat  Yeah a little chit chat on the way over  A lot of chit chat  Yeah we love the chit chat on the walkover  The one thing we don't like doing  Just because we just talked for three hours  So we're trying to just kind of  Take a cigarette break 
[02:27:30]  A little breath  Yeah just want to kind of mellow out  A little walk  Just look at things  Observe  Think  Take the day in  Right  We obviously love our listeners  Oh but then the yapping that goes on  Oh it's wonderful  We don't love talking to them  In between the two shows  No  You just want to mellow out  Stop  Stop  Hey Brie Olsen's going to be on  RanaFest today  I think so  Oh a reunion  Oh that's  That's going to be quite a show  A reunion show  Between her and Earl

Oh look at that  Hello hello  Haven't seen you since the Ron and Fez event  Yeah since the Christmas party in that big huge bar  In that scary Brooklyn joint 
[02:28:30]  You know  That Ron and Fez decided to have a party in  I think we have enough people where we might have to bring those in  What?  What?  I think we might have to bring the bleachers in  We were supposed to have a dominatrix but she bailed or did or Pat Duffy bailed  I think Pat did  Where's Pat?  Pat had to bow out  Yeah he gives us a lot  Pat?  You bailed on the dominatrix?  Are you finally saying no to us?  Not by choice  I would have been balls deep in that literally 
[02:29:00]  Wow  Who got your ear?  My family did  Oh boy  The family will fuck up your career so quick  I've been excommunicated from my family  What happened?  So to speak  What do you mean?  They're mad that you're getting kicked in the groin?  Well they're just not so much  What are they?  Holy rollers?  What the fuck is wrong?  They raised you they can't be normal  Your father seems like he's insane just like you  Yeah  I know  Why would he have a problem with what you're doing on our radio show?  It wasn't so much the kicking in the balls 
[02:29:30]  It was just the revelation that I'm as fucked up as I am  A little violent  Yeah  That was the whole thing  It really freaked my mom out and got my dad all pissed off  So now everybody's mad at me  They don't see it?  They don't like the uh  This is their best effort  They needed the radio show to figure out that there might be a problem with you  Yeah that you're a little fucked  They didn't have any uh signs before you started doing our show?  Well I think they did but it wasn't like as quite in their face as that  Like my dad just basically got showed the video to my mom and was like  Look what your son's doing  Well why did he do that? 
[02:30:00]  I don't know  Dad's a rat  He is a rat  Dad's a rat  What's his goal in this whole thing?  I'm not quite sure I haven't spoken to him  To get you some help?  I would like some  No I'm not sure  But I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that to everybody  Alright  Is the dominatrix still coming in?  No?  She bailed?  Yeah she bailed  She was all set to go about a week ago  And then when we started calling her to confirm  That's when she stopped returning phone calls  Why?  What happened?  She got scared or something?  Another dominatrix getting scared?  She was out of town for a while  So when she got back from town  She just wasn't returning phone calls 
[02:30:30]  So I don't know  Yeah alright  Alright  How dumb are these girls?  You come in and give a good session  The amount of fucking clients you get out of it  It's ridiculous  Very ridiculous Jimmy  Hip hop Ron is very very upset  Hip hop you got the mic?  Why?  Why would it be on?  Oh Jesus  It goes thud  But then  Yeah I got it  Alright  There it is  Why can't we figure that out?  Why can't we figure out the  Alright someone's about to talk on the wireless  We should turn it on  I think it's when he flips it on  It takes like  It takes like a second 
[02:31:00]  Or two  For it to actually  So it's actually  Ron should not speak for about two seconds  And then the wireless won't  Well how about we spread that knowledge  So we don't have to keep saying  Why would it work?  Why would it?  Hip hop I hear you're like mad at our new star  No I'm not mad  I just thought I have to step up my game a little bit  Because he outshined me  Aw damn  People are already saying Ron who?  Yeah I know  Yeah you had your day in the sun  Literally a day  And then you're kind of overshadowed by our new Hebrew friend  Yeah  Yeah you got me 
[02:31:30]  Did you guys  Yes  I think I need to put things in perspective for Ron  I think  I mean I must have interviewed Ron  Considering he's one of our interns  So I'm sure me and Steve sat down with him  I don't remember doing Ron's interview  Oh that's not a good sign  But when Dave came in  Ah  He said probably three words  And I was like he's so hired  Like I had to say to Steve  I'm like we don't need to continue  We could probably  Yeah  We could probably just take him now  Just  Yeah absolutely  He's gold  Well gold steam  Oh Ron's still in the studio  Oh  We kind of wanted David  Yeah bye Ron 
[02:32:00]  David  Yeah  Ron  Could you give your headset and mic to David?

Hi, Jimmy  I didn't  I thought it was from over there  Hey, Saul  Also known as Danny  Why don't you introduce yourself to the crowd  And tell them a little something about yourself  Name's Daniel Curlin from Queens, New York  Okie doke 
[02:53:00]  And?  I've been a fan of these guys since their NEW days  And?  What do you do for a living?  What do you do for a living?  I currently do moving jobs  Moving jobs  Yeah  That's only for now  What do you want to do?  I'm majoring in human rights  What?  Where do you want to fight the violations in human rights? 
[02:53:30]  Where do you think human rights are being violated the most?  I have no freaking idea where they are  Because it changes over the course of time  Where's a place you can think of right now?  Yeah  What I do know is that  They're building way too many of these damn freaking  Two houses in one crap  And I can't see so good  Two family houses? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, like they're building like these things  I don't know what the heck they are  But they got like two doors  I don't know  They're building way, way the heck too many of them  Two doors?  Two doors  How are people supposed to live?  That's a human rights  Two doors, a front door  You mean a front door and a back door?  No, like half of them is half  One house and the other half is another house  That'd be a two family house, wouldn't it?  Yeah, one of those kinds of things  Those have been around forever  You live in Queens, don't you?  Yeah  That's all they have in Queens 
[02:54:30]  That's been in Queens forever  Yeah, since all in the family  Yeah  All in the family lived in a two house  Yeah, yeah  All in the family lived Archie Bunker, come on  There's a few places that have been like replaced with these things all of a sudden now  Right  A lot of them, even more than ever  No reason for that shit  So you're taking a  Jimmy  You're taking a stance on two door houses  Is that  Because a lot of people concentrate on Darfur and all that bullshit  Yeah, yeah  The problem is these two family houses in Queens  He's right  I like it 
[02:55:00]  You said that  Yeah, I know  No wonder I keep hearing complaints about overpopulation in the schools  Hell yeah  In the schools  Yeah, I hear about it all the time  Yeah, talk to the crowd  Not us  You know, give them the speech on the human rights thing  You're right, man  I hear about it all the time  I hear about it all the time  No wonder they're building too many of these things  Plus the other thing I can't stand  Those annoying freaking delis  When you got these people that hardly speak English  Never freaking heard of rye bread  Welcome to Evening at the Improv  Wow 
[02:55:30]  He's just getting some stuff off his chest  What's with this rye bread?  What's wrong?  Hey, don't be dissing on the rye bread  That juice of rye bread  Oh, wow  There we go  My David  My David  Jesus  I'm ordering a sandwich  And some kind of Mexican fuck  Where you got  Whoa  Come on now  Where you got this one guy  Who's talking on the phone  Who I know is freaking giving some kind of terror plan  Talking about on the phone  Amen 
[02:56:00]  What exactly is a terror plan?  What is a terror plan?  That's a good question from David  I have no freaking idea  What the heck language these people are speaking in this deli by my house  This is great stand-up stuff  This guy's good  Jimmy Norton might use this  Every time I freaking go there  Go there  I'm freaking hearing this  And then what  If I'm paying something with a 
[02:56:30]  If I'm paying with a credit card  They're asking me like a  They're like cursing  I don't know what the heck they're saying in their freaking terror language  This guy's good  I'm going to use this stuff  Yeah, Jimmy can use this  Every time I'm freaking going there  And I'm paying with a credit card  The guy's talking in his freaking terror language  Yeah  See?  All I know is the freaking guy  He must hate that  He must hate me having to pay with a credit card 
[02:57:00]  All I know is he must hate that  When I've got to pay with a credit card  See?  It works when Jimmy does it  That's great  This guy's writing  I like him  What else you got?  God, I want Jimmy to do this on HBO so badly  God  His last HBO  I'm eager to find out where the heck Tippy Tom's box is  Because I'm thinking  Hold on one second  I'm thinking of consistently  Danny, hold on  Hold on  One second  That was stunning  There was an observation that we all saw  I thought I caught something  I thought I saw something too 
[02:57:30]  Jimmy, you take this one  It couldn't possibly have been what I thought I saw  No, not on his first day  I had a weird flash  That Ant and I were discussing something  And young Danny began talking  Because he doesn't have headphones on  Yes  And Ant and I were still talking  And I thought that the first day here guy  First day intern  Put his hand up and went  And shushed us  To me and Anthony  He turned and shushed us 
[02:58:00]  I thought I said  It couldn't have possibly been that  No, no  But then I thought I saw the same thing  So either we're having this mass hallucination  Or this guy actually  On his first day as an intern  Decided we should shut the fuck up  And let Danny talk  Well, let's see  We must have misunderstood  Yeah, defend yourself there, David  David, what happened there?  What happened was that Mr. Saul was trying to  Say something  So I was trying to listen 
[02:58:30]  And you needed to shush us  And we were distracting you with our talking  No, you were not  Well, no, you held your hand up  I meant to do that at the audience  I apologize  No, the audience was being quiet  We were talking  See, it was us talking  And then you held your hand up  On this direction  Yeah  Not that direction  It was your right hand that you held up  Thus telling us to shut the fuck up  Yeah, the audience was quiet  We were talking  You held up the hand in our direction  And went  Shushed  So how is that supposed to be for the audience?  I apologize  Do you think it's appropriate 
[02:59:00]  On your first day as an intern  I do not  To shut the show up?  I do not  I do not  Can we give you a wedgie?  Well, no, I think that we should figure out what we did wrong  I mean, I don't want to  Is it okay with hope talks?  Yes  Yeah, okay  Maybe Sean, I don't want you to get hollered at  Yeah, I know  He hollered  Jesus, what a set of balls  No kidding  Anything else we should, while we're here?  Yeah  Any other suggestions, advice for the show or anything?  Nope  All right, just shut up when Saul's talking 
[02:59:30]  All right  Pretty much  I want to hear more about this human rights thing anyway  Yeah  From Danny  Danny, human rights  You're going  Shhh  Sorry  Sorry  God  Well, anyway  What I was saying  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  We have to address the glare now  Yes  There is this weird glare now  That you're angry with us  And the hands on the hips  They don't help  You're angry with us now  No, I'm not  I'm just going to be quiet  And let you guys run the show  It's your show  I'm going to just be quiet  It is our show? 
[03:00:00]  Wow, look at that  You learned something new  We should force him to give Kenny a barebottom spanking  For, you know, disrupting the flow of the show  I'm taking it  Hmm  Hmm  Yeah  All right  Saul, back to the human rights  Yeah, back to human rights violations or something  Yeah  So, what got you interested in human rights?  Knowing a politician that I campaigned for  Oh, you campaigned for somebody?  Yeah, I campaigned for someone who's a 
[03:00:30]  Well, anyway  Well, anyway  My mom knew one of his relatives  And introduced me to him  Oh, he's a great politician  Who was he?  His name is City Council Member Eric Joya  Oh, yeah?  Yeah  What's he do?  And he was into human rights?  No, but I saw  But I saw everything  He was  But I saw  I saw  I saw the job that he was doing  I learned a lot from  From campaigning 
[03:01:00]  So I thought  I seem to  I seem to be  Reading a lot about  About what's going on  So I figured  I could probably  I could probably do this  I could probably  He's probably right  Yeah, he is  Yeah, he's not too far off  I could probably do this  But you're angry about the houses  With the two doors  What else?  What else bugs you  As far as civil rights  Or human rights goes  Yeah, yeah  Well  Well, the other thing  The other thing that's annoying me  Is that the freak  The freaking trash  That's all over the place 
[03:01:30]  That  I  My sister's dog  Oh, Jesus Christ  We're a diverse city  But she  Yeah, but it's a  It's a freaking pain in the ass  Trying to stop her from eating it  What?

You could call it  Monster Rain  Wow, he plowed through it again  I like that  Jesus  That's not a bad idea  This guy's a gem  Not a bad idea  It's true  Like, it comes with  It's own umbrella  And  A  Penis-shaped  Little 
[03:03:30]  Can  And you shove it in your mouth  And you squeeze the balls  And lemonade comes out  You drink it  Because at that age  There was no comsies  There was only a little pee-pee  The boy peed in my mouth  I was in the swimming pool  And I didn't know that  Like, I was sucking his penis  We were very young  And he made pee-pee in my mouth  And I came up  I go, don't do that again  He goes, I won't  But he did it again  Trick me once

Go Grease Lightning, you're burning down a quarter mile.  Oh, there you go. Now he's got the moves down.  There it is. He's doing the dance, you know,  where John Travolta's pointing his fingers straight out  and then sweeping along with it.  Everyone remembers the dance. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Dave, bring it home for us.  Get ready to bring it home.  Yeah.  Oh, this is part of the dance, right?  Come on.  You gotta clap your hands or something.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  There he goes.  Wow, now Grease Lightning's all fucking decked out.  And you put your T-Birds jacket on. 
[03:12:00]  And you get into the front seat.  Wow, Kenny just gave up on the song.  And hit a wall.  Kenny just gave up.  He walked off the set.  Come on, Danny.  Big break in this stupid fucking song, isn't there?  Yeah, I understand.  Sure.  They're all dancing.  Yeah, they're all dancing.  I forgot about how long that break was.  They're all just blowing someone on a plane.  Here it comes.  Oh, my God. 
[03:12:30]  Wow.  All right.  Oh, wow.  They're barely clapping out there.  Wow, that was... 
[03:13:00]  They're barely clapping for Danny.  So you did that back in elementary school?  Yeah, I think I was eight back then.  Eight.  Huh?  Yeah.  Uncle Paul, stop.  Why?  And what other play did you do?  You said you did two.  I don't remember the other one.  Oh.  Okay.  Equus.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's fantastic.  Let's do a script now.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  We got David.  So we've already confirmed one of these people has acting chops.  Yes, of course.  Mm-hmm.  All right, David.  What about you, David?  Anything in your past?  The plays or anything?  Not really, no.  Not really?  No.  No.  Okay.  I'm not too much of a singer now.  I'm not too much of a singer now.  Is that glare again?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  You're more into the production side of music, right?  Definitely.  Yeah.  You got it.  I thought so.  Did you sing your half Torah?  No. 
[03:14:00]  No?  No?  No, I did not.  I read it from a regular Torah.  Oh.  I don't know what that is.  I don't even know, Kenny.  I don't either.  Why do you sing, Kenny?  Yeah, why do you sing?  I don't know why.  I...  My grandmother had to bribe the rabbi to write it out phonetically for me, so I...  Aw, do you remember any?  No.  That's my favorite thing ever.  Yeah.  Grandmother threw a few bucks to the rabbi, and he wrote it out.  Hey, write it out phonetically.  My son's an idiot, or my grandson's an idiot.  My grandson, rabbi, my grandson, he's a dumbbell. 
[03:14:30]  He has a small head like a Doberman Kinship.  His brain is hitting the sides of his skull.  Alright, let's do a script.  You guys give it your all, right?  Yeah.  Alright.  What are we doing?  Casino?  Definitely.  I believe it's casino.  I'm Ace.  You're Ace, and Danny, who are you?  I'm Nicky.  That's right.  Alright, face the crowd and give it your all. 
[03:15:00]  We want to see some acting here.  Alright, let me know when to start.  Well, who's Ace?  Me.  I'm surprised.  David, you start.  You don't like this scene?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm saying I'm surprised.  Do I gotta do the voiceover?  Who's Ace?  It's his Ace voiceover.  Oh, okay, okay.  I'm so good.  You're right.  Alright.  Go ahead.  Yeah, do the voiceover.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Normally, my prospects of coming back alive from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.  But this time, when I heard him say, a couple of hundred yards down the road, I gave myself 
[03:15:30]  55.  50.  50-50.  Oops.  55.  That's alright, he was chewing him down.  Oh, snap.  Oops.  Kenny.  Oh, oh.  Kenny, you gotta get the direction.  Kenny, you can narrate.  Wait, Kenny will do the, uh, narrate.  You be the humble narrator.  Danny's going.  Go ahead, Danny and Nicky.  Go ahead, Danny and Nicky.  What?  Where the fuck you get off taking, talking to people about my, about, about me behind my 
[03:16:00]  back?  Going over my head?  What people?  What people?  What you think?  I wasn't gonna find out?  I don't even know what you're talking about, Nicky.  No, you said I'm bringing heat on.  You, I gotta listen to people because of your fucking shit.  You're ordering me out. 
[03:16:30]  You better get your own fucking army, pal.  I didn't do anything.  I mean, I didn't order you or anybody.  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.  You want me to get out of my own fucking town?  Yeah.  I said I let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino.  Anything goes wrong with the casino?  It's my ass.  It's not yours.  It's my ass.  I'm what counts out here, not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows. 
[03:17:00]  And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?  Alright, hold on a minute.  Where is that?  He's ad-libbing.  I have no idea.  He skipped the first paragraph on the second page and went to the second one.  I gotta say Danny's a genius, though, with this.  I think he's very good.  I agree.  Go to the top there, Danny.  Right there.  Top of what?  Right there.  You missed a line.  Audience highlighted. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, I don't know whatever you know, this or not, but you only have your fucking casino  because I made that possible.  I...  I...  I what...  I'm what counts out here, not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.  And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?  What are you... 
[03:18:00]  You know I get calls from back home every fucking day.  They think you want bullshit.  I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.  You understand that?  You know that?  Come on!  You...  You fucking ass.  You...  You could have the good...  The food and beverage job without doing on...  Without going on television.  You wanted to go on TV.  Yeah.  I did want to go on TV.  That way I have a forum.  I can fight back. 
[03:18:30]  I'm known.  People see me.  They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was unknown.  That's right.  You're...  You're making a big fucking spectacle yourself.  Me?  I wouldn't even be in the situation if it wasn't for you.  You brought down so much fucking heat on me.  I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is, do I know you?  Oh, sure.  You want to blame your fucking license on me.  Is it...  Is that it?  No.  It...  It... 
[03:19:00]  Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you?  I mean...  You asked me.  And I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said.  But what did I tell you?  Do you remember what I told...  Back?  Back up.  Back up.  Back up.  Back up.  A fucking minute here.  One minute.  I asked you when the...  When the fuck did I ever ask you if you could come out here, get this through your head, you...  You never...  Get this through your head, you... 
[03:19:30]  You never...  Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!  You...  You only exist out here because of me!  That's...  That's the only reason.  Without me, your personality, every fucking wise guy shall...  Scal...  Scal the lowest form of wise guy...  A drunken bum?  Allowed?  Take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!  That...  Then where are you...  Then where are you gonna go?  You fucking wanted!  Don't ever go my fucking...  Over my fucking head again!  That...  You only exist out here because of me!  That's...  That's the only reason.  Without me, your personality, every fucking wise guy shall...  Scal...  Scal the lowest form of wise guy...  A drunken bum?  Allowed?  Take a piece of your fucking Jew ass! 
[03:20:00]  Then...  Then where are you...  Then where are you gonna go?  You fucking wanted!  Don't ever go my fucking...  Over my fucking head again!  You motherfucker!  God damn, I wanna see that now.  Wow!  That was...  God damn good!  You were very good, uh...  Both of you.  Fantastic job.  Danny really put the emotion into it though.  Uh, Danny did a very good job. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  The anger was there.  Sure was.  David, you were a little...  Mudder...  Mudder fucker, that was good.  Yeah.  You ever see that movie, Casino?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  David, what about you?  You weren't happy about the Jew line, huh?  David?  Definitely not so much.  What?  Oh, but it's part of the movie.  It certainly is.  Yeah, it's part...  You ever see Casino?  Yes, I have.  Yeah, that's...  You know, Pesci.  Yeah, you know, that's...  Go Pesci, yep.  He's like that.  Alright.  You know, in the movies.  More for these boys.  We got two. 
[03:21:00]  We got two.  Two choices?  Yeah, you could either take your pick of Shawshank or Back to the Future.  Oh no, let's try Back to the Future in honor of Anne.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, well, I'd like to stay but...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I gotta try and take a shit.  I'll be right back cause...  I gotta try and take a shit.  I swear.  Alright, why don't we take a break?  I'll be right back.  We'll take a break.  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air!  We are so pathetic. 
[03:21:30]  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's the battle of the mental illness.  We are gonna dumb this thing down to the point that we're gonna be number one with Down Syndrome children.  It's showtime, folks!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You'll love us!  Alright.  This is good.  What is this?  It's uh...  Who is this?  Zombie?  Yeah, it is Rob Zombie. 
[03:22:00]  Fucking great, man.  Back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Anthony's still making a duty.  Yeah.  Big boy's making a duty.  So, we got Danny and we got David.  Right now, Ant's not shitting.  What he's doing is he's wiping shit off the back of his balls cause they're so big they hang by his crack.  And he always shits onto the back of his balls.  Yeah, don't look at his crotch when he comes walking back in here.  He gets very shy.  He's bashful about his big size.  Huh?  Oh, I know.  He's gonna walk right in front of everybody.  Yeah, everybody just stare at his big cock. 
[03:22:30]  Do we point?  Do we point?  Yeah, point.  Point and just go...  Always wash your hands.  Oh!  Always wash your hands.  Never.  Ugh.  I don't either.  I just licked the shit off of him.  Are we gonna try Back to the Future with these guys and move on to something else?  Sure!  Alright.  Where's my script?  You got it.  Oh, I do.  Alright.  David, you ever see Back to the Future? 
[03:23:00]  I've seen all three of them.  Why would the mic work?  Remember...  Wow!  What happened to the mic?  It's been on.  I've seen all three of the movies many times.  What's your favorite part of Back to the Future?  Uh...  I like Back to the Future 3.  3?  Wow!  You like 3, you weirdo?  Which one do you like?  1 and 2.  But not 3, okay.  3's kinda meh.  You don't like them being out in the Wild West?  I like that one.  A couple of funny, you know, things.  There's tension between Anthony and this new intern. 
[03:23:30]  I think Mad Dog Tannen is, uh...  Mad Dog Biff?  Yeah.  He's, uh, you know, kinda funny.  Hold on.  I'll notice something here.  What happened?  I think Jimmy noticed it too.  There's a little tension between you and intern David.  I didn't know if that was directed at Anthony or me, to be honest with you.  What?  He might be going after you again?  I don't know.  Who are you going after this time, David?  I'm not really going after anyone.  I'm just stating my personal opinion that I like the third one the best.  Alright.  Alright.  What's your favorite movie of all time?  Whoa...  That's a little personal.  That's a tough question, man. 
[03:24:00]  Whoa...  That's a tough question, huh?  That's a tough question, huh?  That's a weird answer, wasn't it?  Whoa...  How about favorite comedy?  Favorite comedy movie?  Shin...  I know what you were going to say.  I didn't say anything.  You didn't say nothing.  You said nothing about nothing.  If we're going to have to go with favorite comedy movie, I'd have to say,  I'd like Meet the Parents for a favorite comedy movie.  Oh, okay.  How about Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  John Candy?  Yes.  I have seen it.  It's a little old.  Jimmy, they should do that scene.  Go ahead, hurt me if you have to.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  This is a monologue, though.  Oh, yeah.  Fat Del Griffith.  Danny, what's your favorite movie?  I've always been a fan of Star Wars trilogy, and I've been...  I actually watched the...  Wow.  Busting apart the stereotypes.  I've actually watched the Back to the Future movies many times ever since I was a kid.  I've actually been watching them this weekend, all three of them.  Oh, yeah?  All trilogy.  How do you have time when you're fighting the world's problems? 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  The houses with the two doors, that's gotta be taking up a lot of your time.  Those damn two-door houses.  Yeah.  Screw what's going on there in that...  Where?  The...  Help me out with the food...  The what?  China.  Yeah, the China thing.  Somebody who yelled China, but don't yell it with such disgust.  I know.  That Opie didn't know it.  China!  China!  China! 
[03:25:30]  You know, in that land.  What?  That land.  Africa?  Yeah.  All right.  Sudan.  Sudan.  For what?  He's done nothing wrong.  Somalia.  What's wrong with the genocide we got?  Ethiopia.  It kills pretty good.  Yeah, pretty good.  Tibet.  Human rights issues.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to the future.  All right.  Well, basically, somebody has to be Marty, and somebody has to be George. 
[03:26:00]  What's be Marty?  Who's George?  David, you didn't want to be Marty?  What's wrong with you?  What about the crazy scientist?  This is an exchange between Marty and his father, George, but they're back in time.  George McFly?  Yeah, you're George McFly.  I'm George McFly?  You're George McFly.  Hello?  Hello?  McFly?  Oh, it's that scene?  See, I was trying to get you into the character.  Is it that scene?  Wait, E-Rock's got an observation, everybody.  He's talking in my ear.  E-Rock, why don't you come in and...  Observation? 
[03:26:30]  His belly?  E-Rock's observation.  E-Rock's observation.  It's not his dick.  Yay!  Oh, wow.  The crowd roars.  I think it's observations to garlic butter saw.  Oh!  No, you didn't!  Oh, shit!  Wow, snap!  Whatever.  No, it's just, any time you guys ask him something, he always answers with a question,  like he never understands a word you guys are saying.  Who does?  I don't know.  It's either one of them.  They both sound the same.  Geez.  David.  Are you thinking David does? 
[03:27:00]  Why would you say that?  Probably.  Yeah?  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  Holy shit!  Danny's...  Danny's just...  Danny's a boy called prick.  Wa-wa-wee-wa.  He's literally like a rain man when he comes to the show.  Wow.  All right, let's do the Back to the Future scene.  Who starts this damn thing?  We got a little music to, you know, pump this up a little bit?  All right, here we go. 
[03:27:30]  Danny and David.  Hi, George.  What are you writing?  Stories.  Yeah, what kind of stories?  Science fiction stories about space travel and visitors from other planets coming to Earth.  I never knew you did anything creative.  How about letting me read one of them?  Oh no, I never let anyone read my stories.  How come?  What if you don't like them?  What if they told me I was no good?  I couldn't take that kind of rejection.  My father's always telling me that if I never let anyone read my work, I'll have no future as a writer. 
[03:28:00]  I know he's right, but I guess that's just the way I am.  This must be pretty hard for you to understand, huh?  No, George. It's not that hard at all.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  Listen, George.  You know that girl I introduced you to? Lorraine?  She really likes you, and I think you should ask her to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.  I think you'll have a great time with her. 
[03:28:30]  Well, I really couldn't ask her.  Why not?  What if she says no? I'd hate to be rejected.  George, I'm telling you, if you don't ask Lorraine to that dance, you're gonna regret it the rest of your life, and I'm gonna regret it the rest of mine.  Well, it's not like I don't want to. It's just that I kinda think she'd rather go out with somebody else.  Who?  This.  Hey, that's the point. 
[03:29:00]  That's it.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  Fantastic.  Another bang-up job.  Yeah, you can tell by the response by the crowd.  Well, the crowd is jealous. They can't do it.  Of course not.  They know.  Bunch of faggots.  Of course they are.  What are those things in front of politicians, those little clear glass things?  It's a teleprompter.  It is, but how come you can't see the words in the back of the words?  It's amazing. You can't see from the back, only from the front.  But you can see through it.  It's amazing, because the angle it's on.  That's right.  And then they can look in many different directions and still see it. 
[03:29:30]  I used to think it was bulletproof glass.  Why would anybody be just shooting at a little square in their head? Go!  Exactly.  I don't know.  Could you guys be quiet while I make a phone call?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No problem.  Watch the laughs.  Hello?  Hey, Jimmy, if I could describe to the audience listening at home, oh my God, I wish you'd  be here to see it.  Jimmy just picked up a banana and put it to his ear as if it was a phone, to the uproarious 
[03:30:00]  laughter of the audience, who must not be mic'd.  Oh, no, no.  They knew.  Of course they did.  I should have made the ring sound first.  That would have got the place crazy.  Orch said one ringy dingy.  That always gets him.  Should we get rid of these guys now?  No, they're okay.  Oh, you mean the audience?  What do you mean?  David.  Anything else, David?  You enjoy your first day?  I'm enjoying it a lot.  All right.  Oh, no. 
[03:30:30]  David will be back.  David?  Yeah, David will definitely be back.  He's a new star, a new star intern.  Plus, if he's not here, how will Ant and I know when to shut up?  Exactly.  He knows when to shush us.  You're a good shusher.  I'm very excited to be here.  You look a little angrier than you did over at CBS.  Why?  I'm not angry at all, no.  Are you not?  I'm just trying to take it all in on the first day.  You promise?  Yes. 
[03:31:00]  I know what that's like.  It's very difficult, taking it all in.  The black or the berry, the sweet or the juice.  Oh, he doesn't get a fucking break, does he?  No.  And, well, he shouldn't.  Hey, David, are you up for a reading from Rent Boys?  Just asking.  Nice.  To be honest, I don't know what Rent Boys is.  Oh, boy.  It's a hot book.  Sexy little book.  It's a very sexy book.  On my number one list.  Do we got Rent Boys stuff? 
[03:31:30]  Well, it's a little too soon to do another Steve Gay joke, and it wasn't that good.  And number one list of what.  It just, it all, it's stung.  Believe me, Jimmy, I've dissected it in my head 20 times.  And I know exactly why that bomb-a-rood.  So happy I picked an opportune moment.  Fucking post-mortem on that one.  Why are you in here, Steve?  Uh, I don't know what happened to that fucking book, because it was- 
[03:32:00]  Oh, I bet you don't.  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  Fuck!  I just-  I don't know whose pocket that might have snuck out in two weeks ago.  Hey, you're right, back-to-back ones are tough.  Yeah.  Motherfucker walk into it every time.  Yeah, what do you got?  That was-  Someone said backwards.  Say it is funny.  Heist.  I know it's still here. 
[03:32:30]  I just don't know which box it got packed up in before the renovations.  So we've got to see the crew looking for it.  All right.  All right, David, thank you.  Thank you.  Yes, David.  Wow.  And Wednesday, we can expect to see you again.  Correct.  For Kosher Sports.  A real bit.  Is your family, do you think, listening to your debut performance on a radio show?  Probably not.  Okay.  Are they going to listen to a tape, maybe?  Are they going to ask how things went?  Do they-  Perhaps they're going to ask.  They're going to definitely ask how it went.  Sure.  Do you have conversations over matzah or something? 
[03:33:00]  What do you do?  No, matzah's only on Passover.  Oh, that's it?  Because we eat them like crackers.  I love them with butter.  Yeah.  We don't care.  Take part of your religious precious heritage and just eat it like a fucking cheese doodle.  Isn't that terrible?  What is it?  It's not like you're at home flipping communion wafers into your mouth.  But we can take your religious shit and just eat it.  Yeah.  It's a bitch.  But are they going to ask you what happened?  Yes, they certainly are going to ask.  All right.  Are you going to tell them about everything, the kosher sports? 
[03:33:30]  I'm going to not tell them about everything, no.  Oh, really?  Now, why?  Would they get upset with certain aspects of maybe some of the comedy we've had at maybe  your religion's expense?  Oh, not so much about that.  I'm not going to tell them about the video that I watched.  I'm going to leave that part.  Oh, oh.  Show them.  It would be funny if you said-  No, it would be funny if you-  I think I can show them.  All right.  He just barrels right over Jim as he talks.  He's shushing us.  Well, he actually doesn't have headphones.  That's fine.  Yeah, that's true.  What were you saying, David?  I'm saying I'm not going to show them the video that I watched.  I hate Jim. 
[03:34:00]  Perfect.  Your turn, David.  Yeah, David, so you're not going to talk about the Two Girls, One Cup?  No, I'm not going to talk about that.  Why?  What would be the problem with that?  Not so much the problem, but it's a pretty disgusting video.  I don't think they'd want to know about that.  They're not into shit videos?  I don't think they're into any pornographic videos.  Now, when you tell them about kosher sports, are they going to be like, what are they doing?  Is that some kind of a thing? 
[03:34:30]  Are they mocking your heritage?  They probably won't know what it is.  I'll have to explain it.  Oh, boy.  And then once you explain it, I'm just...  That's one and done, Anthony.  I'm just asking you.  Is there going to be a problem?  Are your parents going to call us up and say, you know, what are you doing to our David?  I don't think so, no.  Don't think so.  Because I was warned about this kind of thing during my interview.  Oh, you are?  And I told them beforehand.  They're like, okay, are you prepared for that?  All right.  And I said, I'm prepared.  And they said, okay.  Oh, okay.  Fine then.  Well, then everything will be fine.  With that, yes. 
[03:35:00]  Whew.  Just not the shit video.  I never thought I'd be doing commercials.  A pot of gold.  Hold my wig while I do this shot.  I'm going to turn my wig upside down and make it a bid.  The best visual show on radio.  Yeah, there was a fucking commercial with a pot of gold and a little leprechaun and I 
[03:35:30]  decided to do Pacino's voice because he's short.  He's a little fella.  He's a little fella.  Well, David, you can leave, I guess.  Are you done with David?  Does he still have to wear the young, dumb and full of cum?  Yeah, don't go home in that.  You might want to take the shirt off before you go home.  Yeah, hide it in a drawer somewhere.  Yeah, just keep it under your hat.  You can keep it here at work.  What are you wearing under that?  A regular button up shirt?  Correct.  Did you dress up for the first?  I dressed a little appropriately for this, yep.  Let's see what kind of shirt you're wearing. 
[03:36:00]  All right, it's your basic button down shirt.  Basic button down LL Bean shirt.  Yeah.  He's very happy to be here.  Boy, is that going to change.  All right, well, we got us a new intern.  Yeah.  Why don't we do line of the day and start our weekend?  Yeah, how about the weekend?  Let's start that up.  Stretch!  What do you think we've been doing for 20 minutes stretching?  20 minutes since 915.  That's right!  Today, I will be driving home.  Ooh, what do you got? 
[03:36:30]  In a Corvette Z06.  Nice.  Wow.  So, um...  Get the fuck out of your way.  That is...  That is very light.  It is 500 horsepower, six speed.  Um...  Gonna be fucking sick!  You ever see Corvette Summer with Mark Hamill?  I sure did!  You ever see what happened to him?  That's right.  In between Star Wars, uh...  A New Hope and, uh...  Star Wars is a fucking...  One and two?  What?  Which is actually three and four?  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  He had an accident during the filming of that.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, it fucked his whole face up.  So, at the beginning of, um, Empire, he had to, uh, have a big accident outside and  fuck his face up so that he'd be scarred.  Are you kidding?  Why would I kid about Star Wars?  Goddammit, that's a good question.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So, in the beginning of The Empire Strikes Back, what did he have an accident?  Or what?  Uh, he's out in the cold and he's kind of wrapped up and then he falls off of his little  banter thingy and whatever he's fucking right.  No, but in real life, I mean.  Car?  Oh, he crashed in a Corvette.  Yeah, was it? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Did he scar himself permanently?  Yeah, he got all fucked up.  That's why.  He's all, like...  He was like this heartthrob guy in Star Wars 1 and then the second one was like,  he kind of fucked his face up a little bit.  What?  Yeah, no shit.  What's the matter?  I need...  Jay Moore's on the line, but I can't get him.  Oh my god, Jay Moore, don't go anywhere.  Can't you use the keyboard?  No.  Scroll up, scroll, scroll.  Use the arrows on the keyboard.  How do we get him on the air without this?  What happened to the mouse?  Switch to producer.  Switch to producer.  Yeah, switch to me.  Oh, he was talking to me. 
[03:38:00]  What happened?  Uh, we can't do phones over here today.  Why can't we get Jay Moore?  Moore's!  We got him now?  All right.  Hello?  Why are you just...  No, we don't.  Mars.  What are you doing?  Why is Iraq making signals like, just talk?  Because the phone isn't picked up.  Hiya, boys.  There he is.  Jay Moore, everyone.  Before I put on my friend Jay, I wanted to defend how short I am. 
[03:38:30]  Another ah.  You boys, boy, you're good.  But I...  A few days in a row, you've been cagging good old Al.  Yeah.  I don't even have to see the landlord, Jimmy.  But we don't understand what happened.  You were a soft-spoken actor early in your career, and now you're just a loud mouth.  Well, in the beginning of my career, I kind of sounded like Time Daily.  Time Daily?  If you watch our third day afternoon, it's, uh, okay.  But that's...  You know, we're Catholics. 
[03:39:00]  We don't want to kill anybody.  You know?  We're Vietnam veterans.  Killing, that don't mean nothing to us.  Put the gun down!  Put the gun down!  Attica!  And then, uh, you know, but if you look at Cagney and Lacey, she says the same thing like,  Yes, okay, Hoff.  Thanks a lot.  But then, as I got older, I turned into Big Daddy from Canada.  I'm kidding, Ruth.  Maggie!  It's not easy being cheesy, boys.  I'm gonna do all the commercials. 
[03:39:30]  Like the quicker picker-upper when I work on my nails.  I don't have Propecia.  Yeah, people are saying you have alopecia.  Alopecia?  Propecia?  That's why I work on finance, Anthony.  Thank you.  Because I don't know certain words.  I just know in 88 minutes my hair was orange.  Yeah, it was.  I was like Pesci and JFK.  My wig was crooked and I wanted to throw a gay party with a friend. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, Jimmy, where can I see you doing jokes, Jimmy?  Oh.  Well, you know, Al, God bless Al.  Yeah, God bless Al.  I'll be performing.  My second show in Boston is on sale for Ticketmaster's November 15th.  Where's that, Jimmy?  The World of Theater?  Oh, The World of Theater.  That's good.  Oh, God damn.  He's got that down.  I'm so impressed, Jimmy. 
[03:40:30]  You get to tell jokes and you think you're special because you painted a fucking male.  What movie?  I'm going to guess Glen, Gary, Glen Ross?  No.  Why don't you just like embarrass everybody, you idiot?  Oh, that's great, Colin.  That's why he's not here.  ...of consciousness and just yell out random quotes and go, okay, quick, what movie?  And then when they're wrong, go, I'm smarter than you.  I knew what I was saying. 
[03:41:00]  Yo, you should let Tracy Morgan talk to Jimmy.  I got schizophrenia.  I just dropped my belly off in preschool.  And a doo-doo diaper pamper.  Holy shit.  What's great about Tracy Morgan is at the end of every sentence, he makes it sound like he wants to have sex.  For example. 
[03:41:30]  Hey, Jimmy, I love your company.  You make me laugh every time.  Especially when you do your closing bit.  Yeah.  If I was Norm MacDonald and I wanted to see Jimmy perform in Boston, where would I go?  Up.  Ticketmaster Norm. 
[03:42:00]  Ticketmaster.  You know what's great about a Jim Norton show?  There's lots of dirty whores.  Lots and lots of dirty whores.  And they're easy to pick up, you know.  Walk up to them and say, let's go.  Oh, no.  It's all wrong.  Jimmy's a changed man.  I look up at Jimmy.  Literally. 
[03:42:30]  Hi, boys.  Ah, Jaymar.  It is Jay.  Holy shit.  I've been here for a long time, but I haven't been able to call because I've wanted to do dirty impressions and I've had little boys in my car.  Yeah.  Uncanny, man.  That doesn't sound right at all.  Was that your children?  Yeah, children?  Yeah, right?  He's just driving around.  He usually has his son in the car.  I'm in a carpool lane.  He's pulling over.  I got a drop off loading zone.  Come on.  When did I join a jazz band?  Cha cha cha. 
[03:43:00]  Cha cha.  Diarrhea.  Cha cha cha.  Frank Caliendo can suck my balls.  Oh, I'll do Robin Williams, sir.  Yes, of course.  Well, maybe.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Beautiful.  Hey, Gig!  Wait, everybody.  Just fucking breathe a little bit.  You moron.  You hit him too fast.  You got to, you know, the symphony.  That's the pauses, dummy. 
[03:43:30]  I got that backwards.  Scratch that and reverse it.  That's Gene Wilder says in the chocolate factory.  All right, listen up, assholes.  I'm going to be at the Orleans Casino, but I don't know when.  Where is that?  In Vegas.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Opie, you're so naive.  You're adorable.  I get high, real Opie, when you're standing by the fishbowl.  Oh, fucking AJ.  Fucking AJ, man. 
[03:44:00]  Fucking...  What is it?  What?  What, buddy?  No, he's trying to get his plug out.  October 17th.  Fuck.  At the Orleans.  I'm going to be in the Orleans Casino in Vegas.  I figured I would get something up for myself.  I made a real blast.  Nice.  Yep.  Anthony's like, yep, bye.  No, I'm not.  When are you going to be in New York, Joey?  When am I going to be in New York?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Jimmy.  What does Caliendo do?  I'll do it better.  This is my new battle.  It's like Supac and Biggie. 
[03:44:30]  Caliendo, huh?  He does Bush.  He does...  Let's break it down.  He does Madden.  John Madden.  I'm not wearing any wigs, so you've got to forgive me.  Yeah.  You do Madden?  Madden?  Well, here's a guy who runs, he goes faster, and he...  You know what?  You know what?  That's Madden?  That's pretty close.  That's very close.  He does...  He does Bush.  He does George Bush.  He does...  That's all we know.  He does Forrest Whitaker?  No, he doesn't.  I know.  I just made that up. 
[03:45:00]  Jesus.  I will say this about Forrest Whitaker, Jimmy.  I want...  I can't open my eye.  Have you heard my Chris Tucker?  No.  No.  Beep beep, man.  Blah, blah, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.  Blah, blah, bleep, bleep, black man's radio.  Blah, blah, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.  That's what I hear.  Do you wish a Marble Mountain golfer? 
[03:45:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, J.Y., you've got to go blue.  I just called to hear the love of the day.  I love it so.  You didn't do Harvey Keitel today.  Look, a couple of beautiful girls.  Gentlemen, let me explain something to everyone in the room right now, okay?  Who is it?  A bunch of interns and you guys?  No, a whole studio audience.  About 20, 20.  Where's the big fat Bobby?  Dude, the thing with Kalen.  Jimmy, will you give me a little Bobby Kelly? 
[03:46:00]  You know what, dude?  He picked a chick to run, dude, because he knows the women are never going to vote for  a black guy.  Shut up, Pop.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  That's my favorite.  Who did you ask?  Oh, Keitel.  All right, let me explain the World Series to you guys in depth.  Okay.  Who's going to be okay?  Say the goddamn words!  There you go.  That's what I want to hear.  I want to hear Keitel. 
[03:46:30]  It's got to go seven games, Anthony.  The revenue money between those two cities alone.  Everyone knows there's no jobs in this town, are there?  So, it's got to go seven.  All right, listen.  I went to the ballpark today, and I saw Darryl Strawberry, and I looked in his eyes, and he  told me he's saving it for the big one.  You want to make money?  Leave it on the Mets. 
[03:47:00]  And then fucking Victor Argo goes, yeah, fuck it, I'm in.  Like, somehow that didn't fucking work.  Yeah.  Like, I went to the park, I saw Darryl Strawberry, and then he told me he's saving it all for  game seven.  And they're all like, oh, I didn't know that.  So, yeah.  A couple of beautiful girls.  Where is it?  I love Keitel, though, in Reservoir Dogs is the best where he's talking about fucking  what's-his-name-going-crazy.  Bang! 
[03:47:30]  Bang!  What the fuck was Joe thinking?  Hiring an animal like that!  Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  It was like a goddamn shooting gallery!  Why don't you rub some water on your face?  Try to relax.  Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.  He's a good kid.  He got shot in the gut.  It's my fault he got shot in the gut. 
[03:48:00]  What the hell for?  That lump of shit's working for the LAPD.  Larry, stop pointing that gun at my gate!  Say, if I didn't work, I think you've lost control.  Please put the plug out and hit the road.  All in's casino!  Who's she?  Rich Voss!  Please put-  I told my wife that Rich Voss was a Bodak.  And she goes, what the, you know, like, what the hell?  And I go, let me just show you.  And I put him on YouTube and she goes, oh my God, he's a glass bottom boat. 
[03:48:30]  Jay, please put Colin in Reservoir Dogs.  Guys, look, you know, obviously there was a wretch in this whole operation.  And I'm no more than me.  I'm pretty goddamn sure I wasn't here.  I don't know, the guy definitely fucking freaked out in there.  But he seems, I don't know, he seems pretty okay now.  He's a big guy.  I don't know.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  You're holding a desert eagle.  And he's asking you if you want to bark all day. 
[03:49:00]  A guy like that doesn't have one of his, you know.  I mean, he just reached the top floor.  You know what I mean?  We need to get in touch with Joe.  Get this guy to the hospital.  He's getting blood on my shoes.  You know how finicky I am when it comes to my L.A. gear sneakers.  Say the goddamn words, stupid.  That's stupid.  It's Colin driving around the valley with Bobby Kelly in the back.  I broke my fucking stomach, man. 
[03:49:30]  Are you gonna be okay, stupid?  Will you shut up?  You're bleeding all over my car.  You're dead.  That dumb bitch.  You know, if I gotta shoot some cop, that's the difference between me doing, you know,  ten years.  Why?  You know, that's what I talk about in a meeting today.  I was really stressed out.  I went to like five meetings in ten minutes.  That's what I do.  I go, hi, my name's Colin.  And then I run out the room and go to another one.  Because I don't want to listen to anybody else talk.  It's a little boring.  They always outdo each other. 
[03:50:00]  Holy shit, Joe.  God, is that a fucking perfect Colin?  I think he's having a nervous breakdown out there now.  Oh, damn.  Hey, Jay, you didn't do your Chris Penn.  He did.  I said stop pointing that guy at me.  Oh, you did.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  There's so many.  Frank Caliendo is going down in a heap of my balls.  I've been taking that fucker down.  I see those direct TV commercials.  I don't know who he's doing.  He's messed up in wigs.  It's like he's on Zoom.  He does Shatner, I believe, in those commercials, Jay. 
[03:50:30]  Andrew Dice walking.  Ready?  Let's try this out.  Alright.  Yeah.  I got my tongue up this chick's ass.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh.  Crazy.  Hickory, dickory doc.  Stop sucking my cock.  Oh.  Oh.  Where are you going to be again there, Jake? 
[03:51:00]  I'm at the Orleans Casino on the 17th of October.  Goddamn.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's some repertoire he's got.  The last place George Carlin performed.  Ooh.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Bring everybody down.  Don't you love playing Vegas, Jimmy?  Isn't it amazing when you get paid, you go into the office, and your name's between  like Tony Bennett and Shaka Khan, and you're like, what the fuck happened to me?  How did this happen?  I haven't been in Vegas, so I'm doing a show I think in November there for the TBS festival. 
[03:51:30]  I don't know if that's confirmed yet.  Don't confuse them stupid with November.  You're right.  Poor guy called getting off once a month when he's stuck in traffic because he can't get  up early to listen to the show because he has a job.  What's going on with you guys?  Is everything okay?  Yeah.  We're working on things.  Doing alright.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just, you gotta be legendary like Tracy. 
[03:52:00]  Well, we're getting the fuck out of here and starting our weekend, Jay.  Alright.  Well, start your weekend.  I like that Anthony's back out on the prowl looking for skirt.  Fuck.  You know what it's all about, right, Jay?  No, I don't.  I have no idea what it's like because I am fucking wrapped up like a goddamn mummy and  I couldn't get up here.  Are you fucking stupid?  I'm gonna blow that?  Nah, you got a point.  The fucking Make-A-Wish Foundation in my house.  Really? 
[03:52:30]  She's staying?  And look, she signed my mitts!  Holy shit, Jay.  Jay, when do we get to see you on the network?  When does the show start?  Okay.  I'm just going to the Orleans Casino on October 7th.  Wow.  What?  Alright.  I mean, come on.  You know, the listeners like to support us with our bonuses and whatnot.  I don't want to confuse everybody.  Yeah, see?  Okay.  It'll be on like a...  Okay.  It's December 24th, Wednesday. 
[03:53:00]  Next Wednesday it starts.  You want to hear the best part?  What?  My stupid ex-wife that I had to give trillions of dollars to?  Ugh.  There's a billboard of my show above her apartment complex.  Nice.  Who's gonna be okay?  Jay, that's your out right there, my friend.  Beautiful.  See you, buddy.  Alright, Jay.  The great Jay Moore.  Saving this side of the show, by the way.  He's fucking amazing, man. 
[03:53:30]  Holy shit.  On the phone.  That Colin Quinn is better than Colin Quinn.  Holy shit.  It's so hard to do phoners, and he's really one of the best at phoners, man.  Yep.  He's fucking hilarious.  Unbelievable, man.  Hilarious.  That fucking Colin Quinn in Reservoir Dogs.  You just rattle it off.  Hey, could you put Colin Quinn in Reservoir Dogs?  And bam!  It's right there.  It's funny.  Funny.  Yeah.  And it's fucking funny shit.  See, that's what it is.  Either you can do the impression, or you have the material, and he's got fucking both. 
[03:54:00]  Because he'll talk like Colin, but also think like him.  That's what's so funny.  Yeah!  It's not Colin saying Jay Moore things.  It's Colin saying Colin things.  Yeah.  Colin fucking moron things.  Amazing.  Should we do line of the day, or just get the whole out of here?  Fantastic.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  Fuck line of the day.  Jay Moore had it.  Is there anything anybody wanted to cover?  Is there anything really good in there?  Okay.  Everything's good.  What's that?  My birthday on Sunday.  You want to cut it down?
