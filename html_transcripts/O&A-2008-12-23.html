<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's year-end broadcast was a chaotic mix of listener calls, studio guests, and rambling tangents. The show began with Opie and Anthony complaining about their unheated studio, blaming management and referencing a locked "blower room," before shifting to their strained relationship with Satellite Radio executives, hinting at a "rat" amongst them.  This led to a recurring metaphor throughout the show comparing their situation to neglected foster children after their parents' death, using graphic and exaggerated language to describe their perceived mistreatment.  Steven, executive chef at Basil Teas Brew Pub and Italian Grill, was thanked for providing breakfast, prompting Opie to share an anecdote about family members stealing his plates.

The "foster children" analogy continued, interwoven with discussions about Opie's recent marriage, Anthony's dating life, and Jimmy's illness, which hilariously prevented him from meeting a Playboy model.  Listener calls recounted humorous and bizarre personal experiences, often referencing the "foster children" theme with similarly graphic descriptions.  Topics included a YouTube video of a Jets player throwing a snowball,  "Pumpsy Green" (a purported early Black baseball player), Eastside Dave's hidden items, a cruel bit about Tammy Faye Bakker, the term "kickables" for midgets, and various listener anecdotes.  David Tell joined the show to promote his stand-up performances at Caroline's.

The show covered a wide array of subjects, including a year-end review of memorable segments like "Secret Show to the Future," "Cake Farts," "The Deaf Operator," and "Hoagie Boy."  Discussions ranged from Michael Jackson's health and car dealerships to gas prices, the geopolitical situation in Iran, and a lengthy, vulgar discussion about masturbation and pornography consumption habits, comparing VHS tapes to the internet.  Dennis Leary called in, discussing his outdoor ice rink and upcoming book signings, and the hosts noted the success of Jim Norton's book. Leary and the hosts discussed Obama's physique, followed by a news story about a boy surviving a severe neck injury, and a heated, uncomfortable exchange with a caller, Dan, who accused the hosts of insensitivity regarding his past loss of a child.  The show ended with the hosts exchanging insults and goodbyes.

Another segment delved into the mechanics of Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash, NASCAR's status as a sport (with racist and offensive jokes targeting Hispanic drivers), David Blaine's philanthropy, street racing, and drug use among race car drivers.  David Tell was again a guest, and the hosts discussed a plane crash,  a Star Wars musical, and a report of Indian villagers attacking women accused of witchcraft.  The show concluded with a "kiss Lily" bit and more jokes and banter.

A significant portion of the show featured a pilot and his girlfriend, Lily, as in-studio guests.  The conversation, marked by extreme vulgarity and misogynistic and homophobic slurs, included the pilot's Mile High Club confession, listener questions about airplane toilet disposal, a crudely named game involving touching Lily's genitals ("Cup the Pussy"), with Dave Attell participating.  The show included attempts to get various female guests to kiss Lily, discussions about their sexual orientations, and a caller criticizing Anthony's hypocrisy regarding having a female co-host.  Further segments involved listener calls about sports, Anthony's hair plugs and divorce, a false rumor about Opie and Anthony having sex in a church, listener opinions on President Obama, an attempt to run a credit card across Lily's labia, and a planned segment called "Miss Rotten Crotch." The show ended with mentions of a gay nursing home in Germany and a conversation with a listener whose husband is ill.

Another segment featured Patty, a coffee shop employee, as a guest. This segment was dominated by crude and sexually suggestive banter with Patty, repeated requests for E-Rock to smell her crotch, and discussion about the smell of her genitals.  It included an offer of $100 for allowing a host to fart in her face, improvisational comedy involving farts, and listener music requests. E-Rock, Danny, and Travis also participated.  The show concluded with the hosts promoting their upcoming appearances and sponsors.

Finally, a short segment inexplicably consisted of a repetitive loop of the lyrics to "The Most Wonderful Time of the Year," focusing almost comically on the line "There'll be much mistletoeing."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  I got a little drum beat there.  I like it.  Well, here it is. Last show of the year.  It's like, I say it's like Friday.  And then we have a lot of Saturdays.  Yeah.  And then, at some point, it's Monday again. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  But, yeah.  It's good to know that we have to be here today.  But I guess management decided to take the day off because no one turned the heat on today.  Thank you. Thank you for this gift.  It's another cold day.  I can't sit with this coat on anymore.  But I think I planted a hand.  I went again with my young revolutionary look.  I see that.  Young revolutionary wear that I, it's growing to be, it's part of my outfit these days. 
[00:01:00]  I'm just, I'm just holding an AK-47 in some third world crap hole.  I thought you were going to say it's part of your psychosis.  Yes, all that too.  I never wear a winter coat during a radio show, but today it's freezing in here.  It is.  Look, I know times are tough in radio, but how about a little heat?  That's all we ask for.  At this point, that's all we ask for.  Keep the studio warm.  Are we going to lose the heat now, too? 
[00:01:30]  We're broadcasting from Charlie Bucket's house.  Right.  Boy, I know it's tough out there, but come on.  Where's management today?  In the Caribbean or something?  Yeah, maybe there's one of those get-togethers that they have somewhere.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I am freezing.  Can we call, like, 3-1-1?  Isn't that the number you call when you don't have heat and the city has to come over and  serve someone with a subpoena? 
[00:02:00]  With some of those slips?  Yeah.  Saying, hey, slumlord.  Put the heat on.  We're in a slumlord-run building.  We're being held hostage by slumlords.  Slumlords.  Yeah, they locked the door to the room with the blowers in it.  Right.  And I don't mean, like, any chicks or anything.  No, I understand.  Well, that door would be locked, too. 
[00:02:30]  Well, when radio was cool, the blower room was the blower room.  Yeah, yeah.  But now it's just a room where...  It's a room where there's blowers to put some heat in the room, and they seem to have  locked that, changed the lock on it, because Tim was going in there when it was freezing  in here and, you know, doing some voodoo, some magic, and getting some heat out of it.  And apparently they thought that was a bad thing, that he would break it, is the official  line.  But I'm pretty sure they just figure, well, if we turn the thermostat down to 40, that'll 
[00:03:00]  save a few bucks.  That'll save some money.  Great.  Yeah, well, I learned that the A.C. is always on.  Yeah.  Now, you might say to yourself, well, that's crazy, oh, because it's about 10 degrees outside  today.  10.  Well, you would be right in that assumption that it is crazy to have the A.C. on today.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God.  I got that chill to the bone.  My hands are in my pocket.  Yep.  I'm going to put a winter hat on in a second or two.  And I never get this cold.  Ann usually keeps his coat on.  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  I know.  I'm trying not to, because it's just so uncomfortable to have a big bulky coat on while you're trying  to do radio.  Right.  I just keep thinking of, you know, just things that we've been embroiled in in the past few  days.  And it heats me up enough.  That's enough inner heat for me. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, my goodness.  I start getting flushed.  Oh, my goodness.  Talk about not getting it.  Yeah, I think we've got to give an O&A show 101 lesson.  Yeah.  With charts, graphs.  Yeah, that's good when you have to explain your show to your quote.  And I use the quotes, trust me on this one, your bosses.  Yeah, it's a lot of...  You see, what we do, you never want to have a conversation with your bosses. 
[00:04:30]  Well, see, what we do is...  Here's what the show is about.  You would assume they know that much, and then we grow from there.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  We had to explain our show to somebody yesterday.  The show's modus operandi has not changed in pretty much 14 years.  No, not at all.  It really has been the same MO.  And it's easy to figure out if you're supposed to be overseeing it. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Yeah, you're going to have some misunderstandings here and there, but not a clear-cut, absolute,  I-don't-even-know-what-your-show-is kind of a discussion.  I was stupefied, because people are asking about this meeting.  We had a meeting with, well...  Yeah, we talked about it yesterday.  You want to call it a meeting?  A little bit of a meeting.  With the brass over at Satellite Radio.  Yeah.  We learned there's a rat among us.  We learned that it might not be good to play Russian roulette. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  What else did we learn?  We got a talking code here for now.  Yeah.  A rat?  We have a rat.  We have...  Well, what's the definition of a rat?  It's somebody that, instead of coming to you and discussing things, goes to other people  that winds up getting you in Dutch a little more, when it could just be discussed amongst  us, and this, what I like to call a misunderstanding, because it was indeed a misunderstanding. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  There was a lack of understanding of what was going on.  Right.  During our program.  Right.  Last Friday.  And to have to then discuss that, that should have been done earlier, and it shouldn't have  gotten to the point that it got to.  Right.  We also learned that if we do extra radio for our listeners, we're like scheduled to go  to 11 every day.  Yeah.  For two different companies.  If we go past 11, it doesn't mean crap. 
[00:06:30]  No, we don't get to bank that.  But, if we leave early, oh, could that be a major problem?  We don't get carryover minutes.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  You can't say, yeah, we might have left early because we were a little pissed, but look at  all these free hours we gave you.  If we go...  If we went till noon for four days in one week, and then on Friday, we left at 10 to 11...  We could be fired.  We could get in very big trouble for leaving at 10 to 11.  Let's just say it.  We could be fired now.  That's what we learned. 
[00:07:00]  That's wonderful.  It's crazy, because that then motivates us to just go to 11 on the dot every day.  And thus, who loses?  I'm right.  The listener.  That's what...  Well, and the company.  I was trying to explain that to them yesterday.  I'm like, look, all right, so I was a little ticked off, and I walked off a radio show.  Who cares?  Yeah, first of all, it wasn't...  The show didn't end.  The show continued.  Right.  Until well after 11.  Right.  Me and Jimmy hung out.  We were BSing. 
[00:07:30]  Who else was in that day?  One of those comics that were in that day.  Who knows?  They're all nameless, faceless asses.  Plug whores that they are.  Let's get a few things off our chest before we leave for a couple weeks.  Let's, yeah, get all this.  And then when Baby New Year comes in, we start anew.  Oh, boy, will we start anew.  Yes.  All you comics are plug whores.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Except Jimmy, who's going to be at the Borgata. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, my Borgata date's not important.  This is about you guys.  Is it?  Yeah.  If it was, if it was important, which it's not.  January 18th.  Oh, it's not.  It's not about me.  Hey, Anthony.  It's not.  I want to take baby steps here, too.  Yeah.  I want to explain to the, to the quote bosses that were.  A visual note.  Opie just made the quote signs with his face.  We're now trying to make light of the tension that we have with you, the quote bosses. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Don't take this.  So don't face value as a serious problem with management.  Or don't look at it like a bunch of listeners are going to be upset.  Right.  And cancel any subscriptions due to our rant, our comedic, sarcastic rant that we're doing this morning.  I know you're a little confused because you're still trying to figure things out.  Yes.  But your quote boss doesn't want to hear from you. 
[00:09:00]  He's skiing somewhere because that's how tough times are.  See, if this was a Western, see, you're wearing the black hat.  Right.  And the show, we wear the white hat.  And we're like the heroes to the listeners.  And you're the bad guys.  Right.  Do you get how it works?  You know what's weird?  We've been doing satellite radio for.  We've been doing satellite radio for four years.  And except for a couple of little bumps in the road. 
[00:09:30]  One kind of major bump in the road that we got.  I almost got my water out.  A couple of bumps in the road.  That's what the atomic bombs made in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Right.  A couple of bumps in their roads.  Well, we had one major bump that cost us 30 days of pay.  But what the hell.  Besides that, it was a nice relationship.  Yeah.  And I was telling my girl last night, I finally figured it out.  And this is my analogy.  And this is me trying to make light of the situation. 
[00:10:00]  Of course.  So put down your stupid BlackBerry.  No phone calls.  And listen.  You might learn a thing or two today.  About a thing or two.  I said to my girl, Mike, our situation is this.  Why aren't you just saying, let's have sex.  You want to have sex?  It's been 14 years.  I've been waiting for this day.  No, no.  What?  I couldn't find my button.  I was saying to my girl, and then I couldn't quickly say, let's have sex.  Well, you know. 
[00:10:30]  Just assume.  I mean, come on.  Well, of course.  All right.  This is probably in the afterglow.  Right.  Right.  So I go, this is our situation.  We were part of a very happy family.  Yeah.  We had everything we wanted as little kids in this family.  Yeah.  Whatever we wanted.  We got to go on those winter ski trips while the rest of our classmates were kind of just  hanging around their houses and going to malls and stuff.  Yeah.  We had the perfect family life.  Well, what happened to our family, our mommy and daddy? 
[00:11:00]  They died in a fiery car crash.  Yeah.  And us, as the little kids, like not knowing any better, we had this perfect life.  We were thrown into a foster home.  We went into the foster home where the foster family had other children that they loved a  lot more.  Oh, boy, did they.  So, and they wanted to do the right thing.  Oh, you know, we, we, okay.  We could raise a couple more kids.  Yeah.  But let's be honest here.  We don't have the same DNA. 
[00:11:30]  And, and, and it shows because we don't get, our presents aren't as good.  No.  We don't get the food that we should get.  Our clothes, our clothes are hand-me-downs.  Right.  Our room, our room isn't as good.  Our room's not as good.  You know what I mean?  Like, they're redoing the attic with no windows.  It's like, how come, how come the children you had before get a better room?  Right.  And a nice big room.  And we have to sleep in the garage. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  But before mommy and daddy died, we had everything.  We had a great room.  We had an amazing room.  And then, and then it's like, well, we're sorry, but your mommy and daddy are dead.  And we're raising you now.  So shut the f*** up.  Right.  Or you're going to get another beating.  Right.  Right.  Or worse yet, we'll ship you off to another foster home.  That's even worse.  No, they'll.  So, if you want to play Russian roulette.  They'll show us the street.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, we'll be street urchins.  It's either the foster home or the street. 
[00:12:30]  Who are you kidding?  The street is known as podcasting.  Right.  And I wish we could call the authorities because we've been beaten a few times.  Yes.  I'm not used to being beaten.  My mommy and daddy were, they weren't beating me.  They scolded me pretty good one day.  You know how embarrassing it's been to tell the listeners that I walked into a door?  That's how I got the black eye.  I don't even want to pull up my short shirt today because I got like bruising marks on my back. 
[00:13:00]  Bruising hanger marks and some bruising.  Get it?  I explain it to my girl.  She goes, that's perfect.  I'm like, what happened?  Yeah.  What happened?  We've been yelled at three or four times in the last couple of months.  You're not my dad.  Like, yelled at.  You're not my dad.  Our new dad sucks.  What a weird year. 
[00:13:30]  What a bizarre year.  Damn.  But that's our situation.  Yeah.  That's it.  It might get better.  We're hoping it gets better.  I think with the new year comes a new sense of...  Ah, shut up, Anthony.  We're going to say new hope.  Hope?  I don't even know what the word is anymore.  It's hope.  I lost that a while ago.  Oh, come on. 
[00:14:00]  Let's still have hope, my friend.  No.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around.  I can't do the voice.  Keep your chin up.  Yeah, we've got to keep our chins up.  Keep your chin up.  Turn things around.  Find your toolbar.  Right.  So, we might play Russian roulette today.  We're not really sure yet.  All right.  Who do we got in today?  We got our favorite cook in today.  Yes.  Steven, executive chef.  That's right.  Basil Teas. 
[00:14:30]  I'm smelling the eggs cooking as we speak.  Can't wait to get one of those omelets.  From Basil Teas Brew Pub and Italian Grill, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River, New Jersey.  Thank you, Steve, for making us breakfast once again today.  And I get to enjoy the food.  On Christmas Day, when my family comes over.  Because, guess who's catering it?  I would say, uh, Stephen.  There you go.  Basil Teas.  Nice.  That's it.  Because, uh, I get raves.  My guinea family.  Loves it. 
[00:15:00]  Is, uh, they do nothing.  For weeks later, they're calling up going, and the food was fantastic.  And then they steal my plates.  Is that an Italian thing to do?  What do you mean they're stealing your plates?  I don't know.  Like, I got an aunt that stole one of my platters.  And she showed me.  She goes, ah, look what I got.  Times are tough.  She could get a lot on eBay for that.  Yeah.  She stole it.  Uh-huh.  And then told me about it.  So then, uh, Keith, the cop's wife, Anne, she just said, screw it, and bought a new one. 
[00:15:30]  So I'm telling my aunt to bring it on Christmas so she can't come in.  Yeah.  And then when she gets to the door with it, since I have one, I'm going to take it and smash it on my front stoop and go, come on in.  Because that's how I roll.  Nice.  I'm a little distracted because there's a few back.  They're going with our analogy.  Oh, are they?  The guy doesn't, like, leave his name, so I can't give him credit, but he just writes, uh, don't hit me.  I have Jim today.  Yeah.  Yeah, man. 
[00:16:00]  I'm like, what happened, man?  We weren't getting yelled at like this for the last four years.  What happened?  What happened?  Wow.  Oh, remember our old dad?  Our good, our real dad?  He was an alcoholic.  He was a drunk.  But he was a happy drunk.  Yeah, but he was fun with us.  And, you know, it might have taken a while for things to get done.  I'm not going to look back with rose-colored glasses.  Well, that was the alcoholism. 
[00:16:30]  But he was a happy alcoholic.  Yeah.  He wasn't one of those that beach and stuff.  He still stepped up.  It took a while to get the room done and get the big bunk beds in there and all the toys.  Oh, yeah.  But once it was done, oh, we had all our toys.  And then new daddy came in and threw our toys away.  Boy, did he.  Threw all our toys away.  What is that little red wagon?  And we get no radio flyer.  Yeah, radio flyer.  We're living the radio flyer movie.  The king.  The king is our new daddy. 
[00:17:00]  I remember him from that movie.  And we've got to slow down again.  This might be too much for people.  Yes, yes.  Might be too much.  Let us reiterate that this is the Opie and Anthony show, and this is how the show works.  Right.  See, so you don't have to make phone calls.  You don't have to take it personally.  Right.  This is what we do.  We're making light.  Listen back to older broadcasts of the show, and you'll hear the same thing.  That would be a good place to start.  Yeah.  Let it be known that I've never seen the phones hotter with our analogy. 
[00:17:30]  They're having a lot of fun with this, which means we're keeping our listeners tuned into our show.  They're not bailing out.  Don't worry.  And the instant feedback is spinning like a slap machine right now.  Whirling dervish.  Right.  I can't read them.  They're flying by so fast.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Last show of the year.  Thank God.  Last big fiesta of the year.  I'm going to lie to the listeners. 
[00:18:00]  This was one of the weirder years for us.  We've had many, many years.  This is, I don't know if it's a highlight year.  I'm going to put that in the no column.  Not the worst year, though, Jimmy.  No, we're alive.  But pretty close to the worst.  Pretty close.  I would say this is like the third worst year we've had in our 14 years together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would go with the third.  I remember a pretty bad scenario.  There was a couple of them.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, this year kind of.  Just sucked.  Going out with a.  Yeah.  We'll take a look back.  Baby New Year, though.  I can't wait till they bring in the new year.  That old, that old crotchety 2008 gets kicked out the door.  We've got the little baby with the new sash on 2009 to start a new.  Well, we're hoping the older kid.  You know, these broke companies are just waiting till after the new year to fire people. 
[00:19:00]  I don't know, man.  I think.  Like all these finance companies and banks and everything.  They wait because now they're too close to Christmas.  So they got to let everybody get through Christmas.  And they think they care about Christmas.  No, that's why they fired people up until like a week or so before.  And then they wait.  And then they come in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, how about we do a look back on the year?  What's your.  What's your thoughts of of what happened this year?  Hmm.  Give us a call. 
[00:19:30]  877-212-0&A.  All right.  Here's here's one of my thoughts.  Don't you.  Don't.  You.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  And here's another one.  We're taking possession.  That's another one.  Yeah.  That's good.  So we're in this foster family.  But we do have hope that like the older kid is going to go to college soon.  Here's another. 
[00:20:00]  Give up his room.  Here's another thought.  Is that so?  Well, who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Here's what I hear.  How would you like to mow my lawn, huh?  Eh?  Just making jokes.  These are all jokes.  Come on.  Start with a sense of humor and then we can move from there.  You're just a tool.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I understand.  Oh, we don't get along with our older brother.  Who are you kidding?  No. 
[00:20:30]  He was the chosen one.  Yeah.  We're the foster kids with really crappy clothes.  Here we are.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I now have lice.  Here's our new foster dad.  Hey.  Looking good, sports fans.  Great Santini.  Oh, here's every meeting we're in.  Ah.  Ah. 
[00:21:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah, God.  In the 14 years, Ant.  Yeah.  We've been the black sheep for 10 of those years.  Yeah.  We had a nice run of close to four years where we were actually accepted.  Oh.  Come on in.  You're our guys.  God, I remember that.  Now we're back to kind of this weird black sheep scenario.  For now.  All right.  Here, let me reiterate. 
[00:21:30]  Ah.  Ah.  It's a little joke.  Right.  Does anybody remember last thing?  See?  Don't worry.  Just jokes.  We're joking.  That's what we do.  If you look at what we're supposed to do, it's to make some jokes.  And by the way, if you don't think we're like the foster kids, spin around your old radio dial today.  You're going to find out that we're the only live show in radio.  The only people actually speaking live into a microphone today. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  It's not a good thing to tell people to go elsewhere, but trust me.  Yeah.  This is your live show today.  Everyone else, because they're treated nice, they're basically told, hey, take the day off.  Take off.  What are you doing?  Get an early start on Christmas.  A lot of people had the whole week off.  Dude, we had to get yelled at by a guy that is skiing somewhere else.  You know how pathetic that is for us?  Oh.  You know how pathetic that is?  And one guy they fired. 
[00:22:30]  Huh?  One guy that was counting days is fired.  Who?  Tierney.  Oh, yeah.  He was counting days and saying, hey.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, that's how it goes.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Happy holidays from the Opie and Anthony show.  Getting your thoughts on the last year.  Kevin from Connecticut will start it. 
[00:23:00]  We'll see where this goes.  He writes, my thoughts on the past year.  Opie gets married and Anthony dates a leaky psychopath.  It's been fun.  Ah, it seems so long ago.  Oh, boy, does it.  Actually, you know what's weird?  It has been a really long year because this time last year, you were going out to Colorado  with your serious girlfriend of many, many years.  Right.  And you decided you needed to stay in a hotel room instead of spend the holiday with her  family out there. 
[00:23:30]  That trip was what I like to call the beginning of the end.  Oh, yeah.  That was the...  No, we all knew at that point that it was just a matter of time.  That was fantastic advice from a therapist.  Right.  That suggested that, you know, I stay in a hotel.  Right.  Which, you know, I was saying, like, the Colorado thing was kind of getting me like, if you remember  a year ago, since we're doing a little retrospective, I was kind of like, ah, you know, I'm on vacation. 
[00:24:00]  This is my vacation time.  Even though it's Christmas, it's still my vacation time.  And to go out there and have, like, you know, little kids waking me up at six in the morning,  that's kind of what I don't want to do during vacation.  I want to sleep in.  And in that environment, it would have happened every day.  So I was like, let me get a hotel room close to the house so that way a few days I could  go in there and sleep late.  And then I'll buzz back over to the house. 
[00:24:30]  That didn't work out very well.  No.  But there was a bigger problem, honestly.  It caused a big rift.  A big to-do.  A big rift.  But, yeah, so that was true.  So there's been a lot of changes in my life.  Wow.  My house was completely empty.  I started with a beanbag, a Mets beanbag chair and a big screen TV on the kitchen or the  dining room floor, which I would play Call of Duty on, and two bar stools. 
[00:25:00]  That was pretty much it as far as furniture in my house went.  And now it's a gala show place because of Ange.  Well, now you've got the house from Scarface.  Yes, that's what I've got.  That's a big improvement.  That's right.  A very big improvement.  Let's say hi to James in New Hampshire.  James, how are you?  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  I've got a what did I learn this year on the O&A show.  All right.  I learned to take the confrontation out of the room with the girl hiding in the closet. 
[00:25:30]  Ah, yeah, I should have taken the confrontation out of the room.  Right.  This was also the year of the girl in the closet.  Yeah.  Let's not forget.  Burning clothes.  Yep.  Wow.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Chicago.  Chicago.  Guys, how's it going?  How about your bears last night?  How cold was it on the field?  Zero?  Zero.  It was cold in the sea.  It was cold in the sea.  Well, I mean a few things.  And there was at least one linebacker that had to go with the short sleeves. 
[00:26:00]  You're crazy.  It really is amazing to watch those guys just.  Most of them were.  All the bears.  Yeah, because I guess you don't want to be the bear that is in the locker room.  The chilly bear.  I'm cold.  They're all out there with no sleeves.  You don't want to be the chilly bear.  No.  It's almost like we need to get together and decide, okay, guys, yes, we're wearing sleeves.  Yeah, that's insane.  But what's going on in Chicago today?  Hey, this year I learned on the O&A show, Voss is still stupid.  And ultimately, I still hate the word decoupage. 
[00:26:30]  I forgot about decoupage, too.  Yeah, we had a nice new character this year called decoupage.  God, I hate that word.  Nice.  But great episode, but I hate the word.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Later.  Happy holidays.  Yeah, you too, Tom, in the Windy City.  So, what was I going to say?  Oh, oh, oh.  A lot of people saw the Jets game over the weekend, losing to the Seahawks.  Whoopsie.  There's a video on YouTube that's very, very hot right now. 
[00:27:00]  And let me explain.  Snowy Seattle is enough to make Ellis Earl.  One guy, one glass jar.  Well, that's a wonderful video.  Yes.  As several Jets players ran for cover, this is at the end of the game, okay?  The Jets and the Seahawks, okay?  They're trying to run off the field.  Yeah.  And the fans of Seattle, they're throwing snowballs.  Snowballs, yeah.  Like crazy.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  And pelting the Jets as they're leaving the field.  Absolutely.  Which I think is hilarious, and I'm a Jets fan.  But you've got to go with that.  That's clever.  That's like Philly stuff.  I love it.  So, Ellis, Sean Ellis, who was the same guy that got picked up for having a little marijuana on him recently,  and they have to add it to this story, even though there's no connection.  He says, you know what?  I'm not taking this.  And he picks up a huge piece of snow that they're saying could have been more ice than snow.  Oh, no.  And takes it with two hands over his head and throws it into the crowd. 
[00:28:00]  And one of the guys that are pelting him with snowballs.  Uh-huh.  The guy in the stands actually catches the thing, no damage done, and then holds it up like it's a trophy,  and the place goes nuts.  He's got to be suing.  Who?  No.  The guy that caught it?  No.  Fan?  Cool.  Okay.  League?  The NFL?  Not cool.  Oh, yeah.  They're pissed off at Ellis for doing this.  He was getting pelted on his way out. 
[00:28:30]  The video's called, New York Jets, Sean Ellis, throw snow boulder at pesty Seahawk fan.  Thanks.  That's a wonderful...  All the monitors off over there?  That's a wonderful search right there.  New York Jets, Sean Ellis, throw snow boulder at pesty Seahawk fan.  Well, they certainly don't like when the players do anything to the fans in the stand.  Whether it's, you know, throwing something in there or jumping up and punching him in the face.  Right.  Which has happened, too. 
[00:29:00]  Look, he just picks it up and hurls it with two hands.  Pretty much more of an underhand thing.  Well, here it is.  We have spoken with Sean and told him that his behavior following the Seattle game is unacceptable.  Of course.  We appreciate and respect all NFL fans and do not condone his actions.  He got a talking to.  Why is he getting a talking to?  He's not taking the fun out of everything.  Yeah, a little fun spontaneous moment there.  Corbin's statements are always such garbage. 
[00:29:30]  They're always so phony sounding.  Yeah.  We appreciate all NFL fans.  Who's saying you don't?  It's, you know, they're so fake and written by somebody who doesn't care either.  Right.  It's just their job to write them.  Travis had a story yesterday about the texting in the stands to turn in fans that are drinking too much.  Oh, yeah.  There are 26 teams or something.  Wow.  28 out of the 30.  Are asking people to text in.  Sorry, you were close enough.  Why am I freaking correcting you?  Isn't that a little reminiscent of... 
[00:30:00]  Of an era?  Yeah, like turn in your neighbor kind of a thing.  But they encourage you because you've got the phone.  If you see someone drunk near you having a good time at a sporting event, this isn't a Broadway show.  Yeah, you're encouraged to text.  They have a number all over the place and then the security guards come running to your section to check it out.  I can understand if someone's being drunk and belligerent.  Yeah, get them out.  I can't stand people that wreck things because they're too goddamn drunk. 
[00:30:30]  Or, you know, a lot of people have been sued because some dummy's got to drink too much and then they drive home and smash into somebody's kids or something.  But I guarantee you that some people are going to be fine and be thrown out because they've been turned in.  Right.  You go old school.  If there's a real bad drunk in your section, what do you do?  You mess with him the entire game.  You're pouring beers down his back and in his hoodie and whatever it takes. 
[00:31:00]  And if it gets really bad, you kind of, you know, scrap a little bit in the stands.  Good old days.  That's Sean Ellis videos everywhere.  It's on every TV station.  You might want to check it out for yourself.  It's pretty funny.  If someone's drinking in the stands, I like to go over and give him a temperance lecture.  Let's go back to the phones.  Melissa, Pennsylvania.  Yes.  How are you, Melissa?  Merry Christmas, guys.  Oh, you too, Melissa. 
[00:31:30]  What are you getting?  A carton of cigarettes for Christmas?  No.  Jesus, that voice.  Sorry.  That's a smoky voice you got there.  I want to share a lesson learned on O&A this year.  Okay.  That I shouldn't take that diet pill unless I want grease shooting out of my ass, no matter how fat I am.  All right.  I don't think that'll make it.  Yeah, you might not want to O.D. on those.  Yeah, we'll clean it up a little bit.  Don't take meds that make you greasy. 
[00:32:00]  That's what Melissa learned this year.  Thank you.  Educational.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good, Mike.  This year, I learned two things.  Not to go vote where there are Black Panthers on duty.  Right.  And also to keep a mattress pad on my mattress in case of brown squirting.  Wow.  A mattress cover.  Good one.  Yeah, but that's coming in way too much.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show this year?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:32:30]  What I learned on the O.P. and Anthony this year?  Obama president now.  Obama president now.  Oh, yeah, baby.  Thanks, Chris.  Jeremy, Cleveland.  Hey, boys.  You think LeBron James is staying or what?  Or is he just babbling to keep everybody happy?  I could really give a crap.  Not a basketball fan, huh?  I was a fan of him, but he's getting a little too inflated on the head, man.  Well, the team is – you haven't had a team like this since I think Wolf Frazier was a Cavalier. 
[00:33:00]  Well, if we actually win a championship, that'll be a shock all on the phone.  Right.  All right.  But, yeah, I learned that it's possible for a pickle jar to disappear  and a certain orifice on the gentleman.  Yeah, we all learned that the hard way on that one.  And I wanted to say hi to Cherry Pie from Wack Bag.  Why?  Just because I wanted to say hi to her.  All right.  A little shout-out, guys.  Guys, trying.  There you go.  Good luck with that.  Hope that works out for you. 
[00:33:30]  Charlie.  What's up, boys?  They like to say Charlie.  Charlie.  Charlie.  I learned this year that Ted is a manufacturer of many, many things.  Very true.  We learned so much about Ted.  Yes.  Ted's a busy boy.  Ted is so busy with everything from light bulb filament manufacturing to running various emporiums.  Glass shot puts.  Yes, glass shot puts.  Oh, I forgot about the glass shot puts. 
[00:34:00]  Ghost hunter.  Yes, ghost shot.  It's like a little joke I make.  I'm a jack-of-all-trades, yet I'm not the master of too many of those things.  A little joke I tell myself.  That's so profound.  Ah, thank you.  Yeah.  That's a good one, too.  Thank you, Gregory.  Ted.  And if you don't think that they're doing something with the Chinese people, man, go to the sports session today.  You had the two Chinese giants going at it last night. 
[00:34:30]  Godzilla and, oh, no, that's Japanese.  You had Yao and, what, Yi?  It was the Battle of the Asian Giants.  They were making a big deal about this.  And Yao versus Yi.  How tall is Yao?  Like 7'4", I think?  I think so.  A heck of a joke just went through my head.  Oh, really?  I'm not even going to say it.  But what are they doing in China, man?  Because now they're developing these well-over-seven-foot giants. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.  That are slowly making their way into the NBA.  We've got a few now.  They have to be well over the average height of people in China.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Yeah.  This is a documentary on Yao.  It's fascinating because they show him walking around the streets.  It's like, how did that happen?  The average Chinese guy is like 6'11".  Yeah.  Americans always talk about, whenever they go over to Asian countries, they talk about  how tall they feel. 
[00:35:30]  They look at them and they're like, oh, my God, you're so tall.  But, yeah, those guys are really, really ridiculous tall.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  Okay, Yao is 7'6".  Oof.  It's not even fair.  Like, I was watching.  Look at that picture.  Put that up on onaradio.com.  That is inconvenient.  The world is not built for you.  The whole world is not built for your height.  See, I try to tell this to people all the time.  I'm a big basketball fan. 
[00:36:00]  And when you see these guys on the court, they're all really tall.  So you don't understand how tall they really are until you see them standing next to a regular  person.  And there's a picture we're going to put up on onaradio.com.  It's Yao's coach, Jeff Van Gundy.  It is unbelievable, the difference between these two human beings.  Look at his shoe.  And Jeff Van Gundy can't be that short.  I bet she's pushing six foot.  No, 5'9", 5'10". 
[00:36:30]  Regardless, he's not a midget.  Right.  You know, and then look at that picture.  Put that up on the website for everybody.  All right, good.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, we're playing.  We're playing, what did we learn on the OPN Anthony show this year?  Hey, guys, yeah, I got two things.  One, I learned that Anthony has the best hair plugs around.  They're not plugs.  I got follicles.  Individual follicles that were placed in on a balding spot on the back of my head. 
[00:37:00]  And they're follicles that are placed individually with the natural growing hair.  So it looks, you can't even tell.  So it's not plugs.  It's plugs.  You know how they got them in there?  They stood across from it and they fire an arrow with a little hair on it.  No!  They never did that.  With a spool of hairs?  The arrow hits your head.  Well, I've learned something.  No one can listen to me when I talk about my follicles without confusing it with plugs. 
[00:37:30]  Well, follicles are so hard to say.  Hair plugs says it all.  Hair plugs explains exactly what you had done.  No, that's old school.  Hair restoration, follicles.  You just say hair plugs and people go, oh, okay.  You had hair added.  Plugs are like the old-fashioned way that they did it, which was horrible.  Look at those.  Wow.  Wow.  They just couldn't figure out that part.  No, they can't figure that out.  All right.  Plugs.  Those are plugs.  What do we got over there, Steve? 
[00:38:00]  Because I'm starving.  Basil T's cooking food today.  Where are you?  Hooper Avenue in Tom's River, right?  That's right.  Basil T's is cooking up the breakfast for our last show of the year.  I'm going to have a little omelet, I think.  You got some of that fine granola and yogurt over there?  Indeed.  Nice.  All right, we're going to step aside for a second.  Yes, Jimmy.  I was very sick yesterday.  Aw.  And I'm better now, but I made vomit and I made other things on the toilet.  Aw.  Aw.  Jimmy had boo-boo stomach.  I was supposed to go to dinner with a friend of mine, who's a young lady who's been in Playboy 
[00:38:30]  magazine, and I was on my way to the restaurant, and I had to turn around and go home because  I was afraid I was going to make it in my pants.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Oh, what?  What's wrong with you?  Perfect timing.  That's good timing.  Oh, yimmy.  I had to call.  Can't make it.  Oh, Jesus.  How are you?  Why didn't you shoot yourself?  Too busy.  I'm sitting in the toilet.  Couldn't get my gun.  I would have tracked pudding all over my ankles. 
[00:39:00]  Jesus.  We'll learn more about that after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We were supposed to have Gary Hoey doing this live for us today, but he got snowed in somewhere.  I don't know.  Ho, ho, hoey.  He got stuck in Philly or somewhere else, or he couldn't fly into Philly for his gig. 
[00:39:30]  Whatever, Steve.  It's not that important.  So now we're just playing his CD, which is just as good as him playing live anyway.  So what the hell?  I also have 2009 to look forward to.  Yeah?  Because...  New guns coming out.  Well, I don't know.  But, okay, that's one thing.  Good, good.  But, um, a certain payment that I've been making for quite a while gets taken off the old payment list. 
[00:40:00]  Wow.  You're the only person in America that's going to get a huge raise in the year 2009.  Wow.  Yep.  Called the Guinness Book of World Records.  There we go.  When is that?  Um, I think in the middle of the year.  All right.  Oh, I'll alert to the media.  So sooner than later?  Sooner than later.  The light at the end of the tunnel, as they say.  We have to throw a party.  Oh, hell yeah.  Some kind of last payment party.  Yes. 
[00:40:30]  That would be cool.  Good for you.  I want to go with a big check in, like, a publisher's clearinghouse van.  Only call it something else.  Which would probably get us pulled over with the word written on the side.  Why can't you just drive around with a horrendous word on your car?  Yes.  Uh, a lot of what have we learned coming in.  Somebody from the UK had learned that it's impolite for a lady to leave her hat on indoors.  Absolutely.  Wow.  People learned that this year. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  Kevin from Connecticut, working overtime today.  He writes, I learned that when you win a golf tournament, they give you a trophy and, and anyone?  And?  I got a quiz you today on some of this, too.  What was the question?  Uh, I learned that when you win a golf tournament, they give you a trophy and a?  Mulligan.  And a?  A birdie.  And a?  Uh, um, shoes made of sand.  No?  Bull.  I'm just guessing.  I don't feel good. 
[00:41:30]  Jimmy's way under the weather today, man.  Oh, Jimmy.  They give you a trophy and a white baby.  Oh, right.  That's right.  When, uh, Tiger Woods was winning all those tournaments, he's holding a white baby and  a trophy.  Someone came up with that fine observation this year.  Uh, Gifford, he learned this year, implants that feel like a bag of rocks are nice to look  at, but not to touch.  That's actually Will in Connecticut.  Well, very educational.  And Tugger writes, I learned that the table shower sucks. 
[00:42:00]  Man, when you do the, what did we learn for the year?  You learn that you did a lot of good radio for the people out there.  Jimmy, so what happened with the Playboy model?  Um.  You were going to go to dinner.  Aw.  Downtown, probably.  No, no, uptown, because I wasn't feeling that great.  Mm-hmm.  It wasn't going to be sex.  We were just going to hang out, but it still would have been fun.  Why would you hang out with a Playboy model and not try to have sex?  No, but the thing is, I find it odd that you even have to preface that, where it's like,  you just go out.  You're allowed to just go out and. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, but why else would you go out with a Playboy model?  Why not?  Just to hang out and talk and have some arm candy.  You don't want to have sex with a Playboy model?  It's not that I want to.  It's that, you know, maybe I'm being good.  Maybe I'm being.  What if you're being good?  Being a decent human being.  Because you can eat with people.  I'm not going to not have women friends.  That are Playboy models.  It doesn't matter.  I mean, it doesn't matter.  Did you mistakenly order the a**? 
[00:43:00]  I didn't get to the restaurant.  She did actually text me later.  She's really nice.  Yeah.  Well, if you need me to bring anything.  Oh.  And she brought me some Tylenol and some crackers and some broth.  White people?  Yes.  A bunch of them.  A Dixie band.  Did you bring me some crackers?  She brought me a Dixie band and some hay.  And then they played the ukulele and bludgeoned my face with it.  I was vomiting. 
[00:43:30]  They squeezed my milky bosoms.  They milked me into a bucket.  They threw up pretzels.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  Wow.  It was awful.  That's very nice, though, that she came over to...  Yeah, it was really cool, actually.  It was so bizarre.  Because I was so sick and so sore.  Yeah.  You know that achy feeling after you puke?  Oh.  It did nothing.  It feels like an ab workout.  Oh.  Does she wear sexy outfits for you, even though you just want to have dinner with her?  She wore jeans and a sweater. 
[00:44:00]  She was dressed nicely, but not...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Likes and dislikes.  Likes.  Cleaning up puke.  Holding guys' heads as they vomit.  Dislikes.  Man breasts.  Men over 18 without one hair between their neck and feet.  Cancel dates because of projectile.  Well, I won't even say it, but...  Danny always tries to find, like, some kind of website that has something to do with what  we're talking about.  Yeah.  And I look up and all I see is something called Master Blaster. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, God.  That's not good.  No.  No.  That's some hammered mess on a chair.  And she seems to vomit.  Yeah.  Just leans her head over and kind of vomits.  Look, look, look, she clears everything.  No.  No, not that time.  That's right down the old shirt.  Is that real, you think?  Or are they sending that up for a YouTube sensation?  Yeah, it looks real.  You don't know what's real and what's not anymore on the internet. 
[00:45:00]  Let's say hi to Everett in Canada.  Everett.  Everett.  Good morning, boy.  Hi, Everett.  Good morning, Everett.  Well, what I've learned over the years is not only is Gene Simmons a douche, but that  when he's on your show, he's used to plug and plug and plug.  But, I mean, if this is in the sense of Anthony, I can call it follicles.  Speaking of plugs, yes.  Oh, plugs, yes.  Okay, very good.  Gene Simmons wasn't plugging.  He was hair-restorating. 
[00:45:30]  No, he was wigging.  When he was on our show.  I don't know what that was.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Ryan in Indiana.  Ryan, what did you learn on the show this year?  Good morning, boys.  I learned that Jimmy Todd ran for president.  Yep.  And I also learned it was murder.  Murder.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to Redding, one of our regulars from Whack Bag.  What's up, Redding?  Ba-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Hi, Opie.  Yes. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  You got that down, my friend.  Somebody might have talked to the Bear Man recently, huh?  You bet I did.  I don't think he's got any other tapes of that.  Although, he's one of those old-school radio guys that saves everything.  So, he might have a little more Spuzz Buckley.  Ant, would you want more Spuzz Buckley?  Would I?  Of course.  What do you got, Redding?  This year, I learned that the Pavarotti was not at Opie's wedding.  Yes.  No Pavarotti. 
[00:46:30]  Pavarotti did not show up.  Nice.  What an idiot Voss is.  That was so great going through that yesterday.  That was a fun show yesterday with Voss.  Oh.  Fontaine, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show this year?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi.  Hi, Fontaine.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  I didn't really learn anything from this horse, S, but it was a year of losses. 
[00:47:00]  We lost Steve Freed.  We lost Roland.  We lost Fan.  And the great Team Hugo went away last month.  No, the Team Hugo got stronger.  That's right.  Freddy would be proud of you, my friend, Opie.  Have a good Christmas.  Freddy.  Hi.  Hi, Fontaine.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  Now he's listening.  Oh, Freddy, my dad.  Geez.  I didn't really learn anything from this horse.  I didn't even get the reference.  Yeah, my dad would have been happy for me this past year.  Wouldn't they, though? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Bruce in Louisiana.  Well, my dad's dead, so he can't be happy anymore.  So is mine.  Anyway.  My dad's alive.  I learned.  And they ain't coming back in 2009, either.  No.  Oh, boy.  You wish and you wish and you wish.  They're dead for the rest of your life.  They're dead for eternity.  And then every once in a while, you have a daddy dream.  And you wake up thinking he's still alive.  And then you realize, no, he's still dead. 
[00:48:00]  Those are the weirdest things.  I hate daddy dreams.  You have your dreams.  I think they're kind of cool in a way, because, like, you get to hang out with them a little  bit, as long as they're not weird, as long as, like, he's not a tranny.  Some people say that you're actually hanging out with your dead dad when you have those  daddy dreams, my friend.  That you're actually hanging out in the spirit world.  Well, when you sleep...  In the spirit world, Pee-wee.  When you sleep, you have kind of, like, you kind of have a connection with the afterlife, 
[00:48:30]  and you can meet in your dreams, some people say.  Who's one of those people?  I'll say that.  Just people.  Delusional idiots.  Yeah, I have those dreams sometimes that I'm back in California, riding horses, and  there's dad riding a horse.  Looking all young.  It's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like the dad from, you know, the 70s.  Yeah.  Dad looking like Mannix.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, my dad looked like Mannix. 
[00:49:00]  I think everyone's dad looked like Mannix back then.  And, yeah, all of a sudden you're riding around.  And you don't even think about it.  But then sometimes in the dream, you're like, wait a minute.  You're dead.  How do you think too much in your dreams?  Just go with your dreams.  Yeah, but then a, like, psycho...  Yeah, that stupid mind butt-inskies.  Dude, why?  Butt-inskies in, and then you're like, ah, you're dead.  And he's like, yeah, well, you know.  You're the only one that can...  You still hang out, though.  You're the only one I know that can control his dreams.  Because you said that you rape and pillage when you know you're, like, dreaming and you 
[00:49:30]  can get away with anything.  Yeah.  How do you control your dreams like that?  I don't know.  I've always kind of...  Not always.  I can't always do it.  And I can't do it on command.  But there are times where I'm dreaming and I go, oh, my God, I'm dreaming.  So I will just be awful.  I'll know I'm dreaming.  I know I can't get in trouble for what I do.  So I'll grab and just rape.  Yeah.  I'll go around raping and pillaging.  That's amazing.  Because I know I'm waking up and I'm out of trouble. 
[00:50:00]  What about going back to the daddy dream?  So then you kind of wake up and for a little bit, you're like, wow, dad's alive.  I go, I got to tell him about this great radio career of mine that he never knew about.  Never do that.  That's me talking to Anthony.  Oh, no.  I usually go like, ah, yeah, he's dead.  In the dream.  While we're still hanging out.  It's like, oh, that's weird.  You know that my dad's cell number is still in my phone?  You should take that out.  Yeah.  I think it's time, huh?  Yeah.  It's been four years.  Yeah.  Some people leave, like, the message in there and they save that. 
[00:50:30]  I got really drunk one night.  It's creepy.  And I decided to call my dad's cell phone.  Oh, no.  Stupid me thinking that, like.  Was it Twilight Zone with a wire?  The wire fell down at the cemetery, the phone wire.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Oh, that was creepy.  That's a great one.  I was able to talk to his grandma.  Well, in real life, it doesn't work out that way.  Because I was drunk and I'm like, you know what, I'm going to call my dad's cell phone  and hear his voice.  Because I figure the stupid phone companies would do the right thing and allow the dead 
[00:51:00]  people.  Do the right thing.  And allow the.  Well, numbers are infinite.  Figure it out.  Leave the dead guy's phone number as is.  Terrible.  Like, I'm the only one that has thought this.  So, I'm thinking, well, not only does dad still have his cell phone, even though he's  dead, you know, it'll be his message.  Voicemail, right.  Dude, some foreigner freaking has my dad's old phone number.  And then I had to tell him, this used to be my dad's number. 
[00:51:30]  He's dead.  Oh, my God.  The guy probably changed his number immediately.  No, some chick with, like, broken English.  And, man, she was like, she didn't know what to say.  Yeah, that would be a freaky call.  Yeah.  I decided to do it because I was drunk and I needed to, you know, maybe find my dad's  voice somewhere out there.  Yeah.  I read a really depressing article in Newsweek.  It was a woman whose boyfriend died a year ago.  Yeah.  It was really sad, man.  And she has every, like, all these texts that he sent her on her phone still and IM saves. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  There's still active texts on the phone.  That's really creepy.  I think you got to get rid of those.  You have to.  Yeah.  We never got rid of my dad's clothes or nothing, man.  It's like he's still hanging out at my house.  Well, certain items are fine, but there's like, like, I don't know.  That's weird.  Yeah.  I love my parents.  I'll be throwing stuff out.  While they're still throwing dirt on, I'll be erasing the cell phones.  Oh, my God.  I love them.  Oh, God. 
[00:52:30]  But more room in my iPhone.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Indiana.  We're kind of playing a what did we learn on the opening Anthony show for the year thing.  And we're throwing some new material in here as well.  What do you got, Ryan?  I learned not to piss or actually not to be a mother hucker or you will have bra bombs dropped on your ass.  By Opie and Anthony, right?  Yes.  Our bra bombing run.  Yeah.  It's a good bit.  Oh, dude.  It was probably one of the best bits we ever did. 
[00:53:00]  I got more of those that will be playing in the new year, by the way.  You don't like that, Ant?  I put it in the douchey category.  Yeah.  It filed under douchey.  What do you got, Iraq?  Here's a bra bomb.  Fat one, Mike.  Oh, exactly.  From the nose to the knees.  That's all he has.  It's like a sausage casing.  You're like a grown-up Spanky McFarland.  Hey.  That hat.  Danny's got a voice.  He's like a little Spanky.  Grown-up Spanky.  Danny's got a voicemail from his dead grandfather saved on his phone. 
[00:53:30]  Whoa, no way.  Can we play that today?  Yeah.  Or is that too, like, personal?  We can get that done.  You know what?  It's funny, because it wasn't on purpose, either.  Like, it's just, I just never got around to, like, cleaning out my messages.  Oh, I thought, like, the voicemail wasn't on purpose.  It's like, hey, I'm going to be dead.  No, it was actually after he died, he left it.  It was just a zombie voice.  A zombie.  Hey, we're taking a little time off, and Iraq just handed me a note.  One of the bits we're playing, my dad actually calls the radio show.  That's creepy, and I would not be able to listen to that. 
[00:54:00]  I think he was calling from an ambulance to having his latest heart procedure.  Yeah, he was.  And he was making jokes the whole time.  As you hear in the background, whoo, whoo, whoo, because he's, like, there's an emergency  happening with me and my dad's heart.  They were transferring him from a hospital on Long Island to the city.  Yeah.  And he's also the one that created the Greg and Tony show.  Wow.  Did he really?  Yeah.  It's in that phone call, too.  Look where that got him.  There was a story this weekend about a woman who put her husband's cell phone number on 
[00:54:30]  the tombstone.  She's kept the phone alive, and she calls him every month.  But when they were burying him, they put the phone in the casket.  Does he charge it?  I guess they just...  Someone should tell this dummy that the cell phone is dead at this point.  The battery is as dead as the person it's on.  Right, right.  She keeps leaving messages every month for the guy.  How annoying.  He's trying to enjoy his everlasting life, and this mouthy bitch won't stop with a pointless  me yammering. 
[00:55:00]  He's, like, trying to bang Marilyn Monroe.  Yeah.  And his phone's going off.  She's like, what is that thing?  He just got Manfield's head back on, and all of a sudden, C-block starts to ring the phone.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what did you learn on the show this year?  What's up, guys?  Good morning.  Hey.  I learned this year that Pumpsy Green was a Major League Baseball pioneer.  That's right.  I'm holding the Pumpsy Green baseball card. 
[00:55:30]  Ah, Pumpsy.  Good old Pumpsy Green.  What was he again?  I mean, we can't be inside the whole morning.  What was he?  The first black baseball player in the emergency.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bet you.  Okay.  I mean, everyone remembers Jackie Robinson, but everyone forgot about good old Pumpsy Green.  Pumpsy Green.  Or was he the first black baseball player?  On the Boston Red Sox.  Just on the Boston Red Sox?  Yeah, and it was, like, 13 years after the rest of the league.  Right.  Good old Boston.  We lost Boston in the last year, which still makes me very, very sad. 
[00:56:00]  Thank you, John.  No problem, guys.  All right.  Hey, Chad.  Let's say hi to Scott in New York.  Scott.  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  I learned this year where Eastside Dave likes to hide things.  Oh, boy.  Didn't we?  Yeah.  Well, and then I curse Ronnie B for taking that bit away from us.  Why did he take it away?  You know, he thinks Eastside Dave's better than that, but we all know in the end he's just not.  Ronnie B's got to run his own crew and his own ship. 
[00:56:30]  As he sees fit.  As he sees fit, right.  How about we get permission to have Eastside Dave do one more of those?  One last one?  To end the year.  And then we'll all be happy.  Ring out the year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't remember this one.  Marvin in Tennessee.  Marvin?  Marvin Nash.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey, I learned that all Tammy Faye wanted was a cheeseburger and french fries, but all the old bag of bones could muscle down with some rice pudding. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  That was, God, I listened to that.  That was one of our darkest bits of the year.  I listened to the replay of that.  It was pretty recently.  Yeah.  It was when Tammy Faye was on Larry King, and we were playing clips of it, and we were brutal.  Just brutal.  Were we really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  One more before the break, and then it's omelet time.  We got Basil Tees from Tom's River in studio today.  Hooper Avenue is where they're located.  Steve's doing a great job over there. 
[00:57:30]  Jake, Wisconsin.  Hey, guys.  Thanks to Steven F., I learned that midgets are now kickables.  Yeah, let's not forget that one in the new year.  That is the greatest, greatest term for midgets ever, kickables.  Thank you, Jake.  Yeah, punch it out.  All right.  With that, we go to break.  877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony, last show of the year.  Thank God.  La, la, la, la, la.  You guys never learned my favorite Christmas song. 
[00:58:00]  No, we didn't.  I get interrupted a bunch of times trying to tell the fine folks out there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  877-212-ON-A.  Kind of doing a look back on the year.  Yeah.  A lot of what did we learn coming in for the year.  Terry in Massachusetts, I learned there's nothing wrong with the beer we got.  What's wrong with the beer we got? 
[00:58:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  Will you stop, Kevin?  We know you're out there.  Stop.  Give other people a chance.  I'm going to give Kevin from Connecticut best instant feedbacker of the year.  What?  I'm going to give Kevin from Connecticut the award.  That's a bold statement.  I'm going to give it to him.  Why?  Just hand one out.  Just to piss off Stephen S. from Bayshore.  That's the only reason.  I'm sick of all the free beer we're giving you.  Haven't you noticed the economy sucks? 
[00:59:00]  What do you want from us?  I think he has noticed.  It sucks.  When you don't get any paychecks.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I learned that Anthony likes Back to the Future.  Boy, did we learn that a little too much.  It's not just me.  Back to the Future show replay this weekend?  That is correct.  Wow.  Well, due to overwhelming demand.  Of course.  And due to the excellent Crunch Gear article, Top Five Moments in Satellite Radio for 2008.  Number one, The Secret Show to the Future. 
[00:59:30]  So that's going to re-air this coming Saturday at 9 p.m. Eastern on XM202, Sirius 197.  Nice.  Fantastic.  You play right along.  You get the movie.  Pink Floyd, Wizard of Oz Styles.  It's like live DVD commentary.  Yep.  That was Top Moments in Satellite Radio for 2008.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Yeah, it was.  Beating out all the bigwigs in Satellite Radio.  Of course it was.  It was fantastic.  The voting would have went differently.  It actually was a really good show. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, by the way, we are on Satellite Radio.  You wouldn't know it if you've been listening to the commercials they're playing for everybody.  All over the place, by the way.  Yeah.  You can't turn on a radio station in New York without hearing about Satellite Radio.  Yeah, Opie again, the foster parents, not as good as the original parents that were killed.  No.  And we had to be put in the foster home.  The foster parents promised us that we would be treated as well as our original parents,  if not better. 
[01:00:30]  This is a Madame commercial they're playing all over the goddamn place.  There's something so goddamn sexy about that bitch.  But no.  You don't like her?  That blonde, friggin' leggy bitch that cuts her pants off and chops her hair off and stuff?  But she looks, there's a little guy-ish in her.  No, there should be.  There's something, I don't know what it is.  It just kind of gets my attention.  Also in 2008 on the Opie and Anthony Show, we brought you Cake Farts. 
[01:01:00]  We brought you The Deaf Operator.  We brought you Hoagie Boy.  And let's not forget, I forgot until I just saw this written for me,  Tibby Tom playing blackjack.  All right, and then losing it all.  Poor Tibby Tom.  Yeah, let's do another one, double to nothing.  Ah, yeah.  Tibby Tom.  Hey, we got David Tell. 
[01:01:30]  Where's Dave?  Let's get him in for our big end of year show that we're doing right now for everybody.  David Tell's going to be at Caroline.  December 26th through the 30th.  What's up, David?  Hi, guys.  What's going on, Dave?  Hey, Dave.  Hey, guys.  How have you been, man?  Good?  Happy holidays.  Thank you, sir.  This is our last show of the year.  I heard it was going to be a big, where's everybody?  Everyone's off.  Okay.  Yeah, everyone took off. 
[01:02:00]  You know, there's no management here.  There's no anything else.  It's so sad.  Well, they've been told to, you know, take the rest of their careers off.  It's a home alone situation.  Yeah, exactly.  You guys celebrate or?  Celebrate what?  You know, Chris, like, do you, Jim?  I do, yeah.  Somehow I could see you, like, decorating a tree with a prostitute.  Watch the balls, honey.  Left garland.  Oh, I thought you meant literally, like, he'll just throw her into the tree and decorate  the tree with a prostitute.  Like that's somebody's cake? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Okay, honey.  Easy.  Easy with the garland.  Yeah, this is the first year I'm kind of doing the whole Christmas thing with the  family coming over.  Big tree.  Of course, basil teas is catering because I'm not cooking.  How big is your tree?  It's 15 feet.  Is it really?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  It's the dumbest, ridiculous tree.  I want a picture of that.  It's very tall.  Because I know I won't be invited over.  No, of course you're invited over. 
[01:03:00]  I at least want to see a picture of your festive house.  Have you got the crazy lights on it this year, too?  Crazy lights, not so much, not where, you know, people are driving by the outside of  the house, taking pictures and, you know, all that crap.  Yeah.  But, and I live in a Jewish neighborhood.  Oh, boy.  So I am the only house with Christmas lights on it.  And I'm driving around just going, there's not even, like, in the last year, I remember  one or two others.  But now, nothing.  I mean, I am alone.  It's like I am legend for Jews. 
[01:03:30]  Because, you know, growing up as a Hebrew, my parents used to drive us, like, let's go  see how the, you know, the goyim, as we used to say.  The goyim.  Yeah.  Let's see what they do.  Their holiday's more fun.  No, it isn't.  We hide the gifts.  That's how it is.  It's all lit up.  And then I got the inside lights and decorations inside.  You got that big wreath?  A big wreath on the outside.  And then there's a big wreath over the fireplace.  And then there's, like, I guess, what is it called? 
[01:04:00]  Holly.  Wow.  It's traditional.  It goes over the mantle of the fireplace.  You throw some logs.  They have a big garland thing that's over there.  And then, you know, start a fire.  It's kind of nice.  Oh, that's nice.  It's like crackling fire.  Nah.  Do you have a nativity?  Action figure, Seth?  No, I'm not very religious.  So I keep, like, the religion out of Christmas.  I'm more like a Norseman.  And I'm just celebrating the winter solstice. 
[01:04:30]  You know, drag a tree inside.  You should have been the guy with the real-life nativity scene outside your house.  Oh, really?  You should have been the guy.  Hire some people to stand out in the freezing cold with a little child.  Hire a bunch of the Mexicans after they clean your house.  Rent a Jesus.  They've got to keep trading out the kid because he's freezing.  Is coffee supposed to be lumpy?  Just wondering.  Usually not.  It means they're curled.  It's not you, by the way, Stephen, from Basil T's, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River. 
[01:05:00]  Or snap.  I make my own coffee in the morning, and this is, like, this is chunky for some reason.  Wow, look at that.  That's quite a spread, guys.  I ran out of milk.  I had to spank.  Anything for you, G.H.?  Just a thought.  You ever, like, stay in a hotel, like, on the road, and they have that, like, continental breakfast in the morning?  It's always you and, like, several businessmen who are, like, you know, coming off a hard, you know, night at the strip club.  Yeah, something.  You don't want to take more than your share.  Then there's the guy, the, you know, the triathlete college, you know, superhero. 
[01:05:30]  Let's take a melon and a whatever.  He's a bit up for hours running.  I always have to take a dump at continental breakfast.  I always feel like I have to take a dump.  Really?  Yeah, it always makes me feel like I have to go to the bathroom.  They really pump those things up like they're something.  They're awful.  It's a dry, cold bagel.  Yeah.  It's not.  It's like, this sucks.  It's a litter box here.  Like, two old people, me, and then, like, you know, whatever, like, a weird, like, homeless family that somehow, like, worked their way in. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that's nice.  What is that?  That's a piece of steak.  Oh, steak in the morning.  Yeah.  What is it, Invasion Day?  Living like kings.  Steak and eggs, boys.  Steak in the morning.  We're going in.  It's hysterical.  Those boys had no illusions.  That looks like a nice steak.  What kind of steak is that?  It's the best, man.  You've got to grab one. 
[01:06:30]  Wow.  Eat meat there, David.  I love me.  Oh, then you're going to want some of this.  Oh, my God.  Is that good?  It's steak and eggs in the morning.  It's the only way to go.  Hey, were you at the Caroline's party last night, Jim?  This is sick, man.  That was in bed.  Are you sick?  Do you go?  Yeah.  You know, like, the big thing that people were talking about was that Michael Jackson was sick.  And he might be, you know.  Is he dying?  I hope so.  Well, now they're saying today that not only is he not dying, he's going to go on a world  tour.  He is.  Yeah.  His brother said that he's in very serious condition.  Oh, his brother's now saying it, too.  That's what I heard yesterday on the news. 
[01:07:00]  I think he just needs a little more attention.  I was wondering if he would have.  I know this is in poor taste, but if he had, you know, passed, if the dance floor of Caroline's  would have, like, filled out with young boys kind of celebrating the past of their demon.  But so he's really sick, huh?  Well, where is he living again?  I don't know.  Abu Dhabi?  Abu Dhabi?  Yeah.  He's somewhere in the middle.  I hope he's got the best money can buy.  Yeah, he needs new lungs or something. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that, like, heavy smoker?  No.  No, I implied yesterday that it was from baby powder.  He's got some kind of mesothelioma that only baby powder gives you.  Oh, they're showing that shoe video.  That's good.  So, why does he need two new lungs?  Uh, he's got some kind of, uh, genetic lung disease.  At least that's what they're saying.  You know, so, uh, maybe that's why he was always wearing that, that mask. 
[01:08:00]  Uh, no.  Really?  But I thought it was, you know, because he's a pedophile and didn't want to be, you know,  looked at with disdain.  Yeah, because no one's going to look at you when you look like that.  Yeah.  I heard he was losing his pigment.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, he had that, too.  That's what he said.  I think everything that comes out of his mouth seems to be, um, uh,  Balderdash.  Balderdash, and very small.  The trials of Job with him.  Ah, jeepers.  What's it called when you're losing your pigment?  I forget what it's called.  Vitiligo. 
[01:08:30]  Vitiligo.  Yeah.  Vitiligo.  He just got out of jail.  Oh, wait.  That's Lily.  What's that guy's name again?  Oh, Lily O'Brocko or whatever?  Yeah.  He's O'Brocko.  There's a lot of, well, the, what, uh, the Soprano dude?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was found not guilty for that, uh, that cop shooting.  But he's still got, uh, some charges pending that could give him up to 15 years or something  like that.  Yeah.  Just in time for the Oscars.  Yeah.  So you don't feel good, huh?  No.  Are you on the road?  A little bit here and there.  Not too much lately.  Oh.  He's on the old dirt road. 
[01:09:00]  Jimmy.  Jimmy couldn't go to dinner with a Playboy model last night because he, uh, might have  had the runs.  I was awful.  Really?  Yeah.  That's a, that's a weird situation to be in.  That is God punishing him.  What month?  Who was he?  This was a few years ago, I think.  Well, you really are sick.  Yeah.  His eyes are very low energy.  I know.  I'm just, uh, I was just vomiting and, you know, you know, it stinks.  Yeah.  Bundle of nothing.  It's called being a man.  Suck it up.  Yeah.  Walk it off.  You came in. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, that's good.  Well, you wanted your bonus, but.  Bonus.  My God.  Bonus.  No one's getting bonuses in any industry this year.  I think they were going to give you GM cars or something.  Oh.  Everybody gets a.  Yeah, they should start giving those away.  You see that Toyota had a loss for the first time in what?  How many years?  Ever.  I think ever.  I got to buy a car this year.  First loss ever.  Ever.  I got to buy a car.  What do you think, guys?  Uh, I guess.  They're pretty much giving them away.  Just pick your lot.  I just want to see that, the hard sell on the lot, you know. 
[01:10:00]  Listen, son.  My kid, he's got this lung thing.  I think it's baby powder.  I don't know what.  Hey, we got that true coat for you, too.  We put the true coat.  We'll throw that in for free, the true coat.  I think for once you got the upper hand at a car dealership.  Yeah, definitely.  If you can't figure out how to get a deal.  Oh, my God.  You're the dumbest individual.  Ever.  What kind of rube goes in there and pays sticker?  You know, you're going in.  Yeah.  You can just go, look.  Look.  I'm taking it for free.  Let's start by dividing that by two. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And we go across the street.  I'll give you 20 bucks.  Right.  Sold.  Oh, my God.  Who's getting ripped off in a car dealership?  And then a couple of months ago, if somebody told you that this morning on the news you  would hear gas prices are the lowest they've been in five years, you'd be like, what the  what happened?  Yeah.  Really?  We're paying.  Yeah.  It's the lowest in five years.  A dollar sixty something is the national average right now.  And when we were paying close to three, four dollars, close to four bucks. 
[01:11:00]  Only four.  Twenty.  Yeah, dude.  Wow.  In like six months, man.  That's great.  The price per barrel dropped over a hundred dollars.  Yeah.  A barrel.  And man, if I only had that Grey's oil almanac, I would have gone back in time and given it  to myself and shorted oil.  They must be hurting over in Tehran.  Dobby or wherever the hell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure they're hurting. 
[01:11:30]  Put the pause button on the nuke program.  Am I right?  Let's talk hardball.  Let's go.  Yeah.  When they have to cut back, it's always something horrible.  Oh, AK-47's got to stop importing those and a nuclear plant that we're building only  for power and not for weapons.  Do you like Google that?  Because this is my thing.  I'll come home after the show.  Masturbate.  I'm going to say that.  No, you can't actually.  No, no, no.  You could say, have fun with yourself.  Okay.  It's so stupid.  Well, whatever.  Sorry. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  That.  Yeah.  You know, rub one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Rub one in.  Okay.  Then I get this amazing, like, scientist mind where I'm like, let's see, how would Israel  hit Iran?  Could they do it with subs?  Like, why is that?  Yeah.  You get the poison out of your system.  And your mind can actually think about something else other than pornography on the internet.  Because I find I'll do that, too.  Like, if you're satisfied and you're drained of the poison, you'll look at other things  and actually learn a thing or two. 
[01:12:30]  Well, you know, I want to learn about a little bit of history or something.  The best thing to do is to just get that out of the way.  Just get it out of the way as quickly as possible.  Stop thinking too much and let your mind wander.  Just get it out of the way.  Which is Jimmy's problem.  He's talked about that in the past.  You can't just get it out of the way.  You work yourself up to the point and then try to find something better.  It's called edging.  Edging?  An edge, yeah.  You're an edger?  Yeah.  Yeah, you just like, all of a sudden you pull your hand away real quick.  Yeah.  And you'll do this for hours?  Oh, God.  And then click, click, find something new.  You catch air.  Click, click, click. 
[01:13:00]  Go through 600 girls.  Plug that in.  Yeah, definitely on the site.  Try to find the perfect one, too.  The one's the starter wife.  The ta-da.  On your way through.  You want to find the ta-da girl.  The one that's finished off with the box of tissues.  That's the worst, though.  You miscalculate.  Oh, my God.  You're just trying to, X a box closed.  Ah!  Yeah.  You blurr.  And meanwhile, you're pulling the window open bigger.  It's just nothing.  The picture of your mom comes up. 
[01:13:30]  Ah, so you're trying to get to it.  Thanks for getting it.  That one picture.  The beach.  Miscalculating.  That is a problem out there.  When you're in that state.  Oh, you had a grand plan, and all of a sudden, oh, I got rid of the poison during this part  of the video.  This is not what I wanted.  Yeah, you really got to time things sometimes.  It's kind of like cooking dinner.  You got to get it all.  It was out, right?  You don't want the sound.  Yeah.  Dude, how?  The sound would come out at the same time.  The sound would come out at the same time as the main course. 
[01:14:00]  How difficult was it on VHS, though, to time the perfect game?  Because you'd have to watch the thing for a while.  Pick your moment.  Pick your scene.  Rewind.  Yep.  And then work it up to that moment and actually finish up right at that moment.  Right.  And you couldn't have any of those where the guy's face was like, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Or the Bob shot, we like to call it.  Yeah.  The back of the B.O.B. shot.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  I don't want to see that swinging frigging, you know.  Hammer.  Liberty Bell hammer in there just rocking back and forth.  You'd have to commit to a tape because to get up and go over there and like pull it out  and pull it out of the duffel bag, that was like way too much.  You'd lose, you know, initiative.  Another thing is like there was so much more guilt with tapes than there is with the Internet.  When you're done with the Internet, click, click, click, done, done, goodbye, shut everything  down.  With a tape, it was like, oh, find the remote. 
[01:15:00]  And it's the remote that everyone else is going to be touching.  So you've got to make sure your hand's kind of clean.  You don't want to be watching, you know, somebody using the remote.  Sock.  Yeah.  Use a sock in a crunch.  Use a sock.  And then you've got to maybe rewind the tape because if it's at a certain point, maybe if  you're living with somebody, they'll know that that point was worked up to.  It's just so much.  You would share porno?  That's your Dustin Hoffman story. 
[01:15:30]  Back in the day before I could afford my own porno.  Way back in the day.  You used to share porno.  No, if some porno was in with some other tapes, you'd always wonder if somebody was going  to be like, oh, that porno wasn't up to that part.  What's it doing here?  Why isn't it at the beginning?  Yeah.  And why did the porno end right here?  Yeah, right there.  You weirdo.  At the money shot.  Yeah, but it's some just weird thing.  Yeah, yeah.  So you'd have to then rewind, which keeps the whole thing going up.  You sick, disgusting thing. 
[01:16:00]  It's so easy to just shut her down now.  Shut it down.  My, you know, on the extras, now they give you like a bonus girl on a lot of these things,  which really is great for herself.  You didn't make the bonus girl.  Who makes that call?  You know, Tamara, good news, bad news.  You're in the film.  It's not.  I tell you.  You didn't make the final cut.  Girl number three took it to another level.  We ran out of time.  Yeah.  Three on the DVD.  The extras. 
[01:16:30]  The extras, right.  All right.  We got David Tell at Caroline's at 26th through the 30th.  Yes.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  That's very, very cool for the people staying in New York.  This haul in here.  Yeah, it's going to be good.  I want to see Marley in me and Owen Wilson.  That looks really funny.  Oh, boy.  That guy's good.  I can't watch him now without thinking of Jimmy's impression of him.  His stupid lips.  Boy.  Terrible. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  His charming smile.  You know how great like a hot pan of grease would look right in his face?  So what you're saying is, you know, scariest environment ever.  Okay, I get it.  I get it.  What?  That's a good one.  That's horrible.  I didn't even know.  It's my first try at it.  Stupid comb down.  I'm going to have to work on that one.  That's not a bad Owen Wilson, though.  He's got potential.  I'd love to see what he looks like when his hair isn't sprayed over his forehead.  Yeah.  That stupid fruity 2000 thing that these guys do. 
[01:17:30]  I bet he's hiding just a world of hurt.  That probably goes back a ways.  Oh, it's great.  That's stupid.  In his follicles.  What an intense follicle emporium.  Aren't you going to see The Amazing Life of Mr. Blah Blah Blah?  What is that movie again?  The Brad Pitt movie?  I think that's a Stephen King story, if I remember correctly.  It's where he ages backwards, right?  Yeah.  Don't give it away.  That is like ultimate ego.  Like, Christmas Day, you're coming out like Jesus. 
[01:18:00]  All right?  You're amazing.  We're going to give up the holiest day of the year to see you.  Opening Christmas Day.  Yeah, you're going to be sitting in a movie theater.  That is pompous.  You're right.  More with David Tell.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's so festive in here.  Opie and Anthony.  You got Jimmy falling asleep on the couch.  You got Steve in the corner making omelets and steak for everybody. 
[01:18:30]  I just had a steak.  Yeah, the steak was good, right?  Unbelievable.  Basil T's, Hooper Avenue, Tom's River, and David Tell.  He's going to be at Caroline's the 26th through the 30th.  This song reminds me of Die Hard, the original one.  Two?  What?  Is it two?  Yeah, I do believe this was prominently featured in Die Hard 2.  I thought it was the first one with the Nakatomi Plaza, because they were having a Christmas party. 
[01:19:00]  I'll put money on two, but I'll check it out.  I'm going to say one.  All right, we're on.  I never got Die Hard.  I like Bruce Willis enough, but I never got the whole idea of it.  I like the first one.  Just, you know, he ends up in the building, and Hans Gruber is there with his cohorts,  and they're trying to steal some barabonds.  Oh, that's what it was?  Yeah, he goes through the building and kind of, you know, screws everything up.  But it's such an 80s movie now when you watch it.  It's just like...  What was David Tell's problem with the movie?  I don't know.  I just, I don't like any movie where a guy's hanging off or something, 
[01:19:30]  whether it be a plane or a car moving fast.  And you don't like hanging off?  Yeah, I just feel like, you know, there is a time when even, you know, you give up.  Like, hey, we'll get him another day, or, you know, I need help.  Kind of takes you out of the movie a little bit.  Yeah, you know, I think it's bad for kids, you know, to see that, you know.  Well, it shows a little stick-to-itiveness, a little gumption.  Well, maybe.  I mean, it's called Die Hard, not Try, you know, a little bit.  There was a list of the biggest douches in movie history, I believe. 
[01:20:00]  And one, a glaring omission, was Ellis.  From Die Hard, who could have been one of the biggest douches in a movie.  Not a question to the list.  Hey, Spickensy talk.  Yeah.  Hey, we're the same, you know.  You work with a gun, I use a fountain pen.  And then when he's taking that last sip of soda,  and he kind of looks at the corner of his eye before they shoot him in the head.  Wonderful.  Stupid Ellis.  Let's say hi to Dennis Leary. 
[01:20:30]  Dennis is checking in.  Mr. Leary.  Hi, guys.  Happy Holidays.  Well, you're a Merry Christmas guy.  Merry Christmas to you.  Why is Jimmy falling asleep on the couch?  I'm sick.  It might be a little bit of flu symptoms or something, but I'm just a bit ill.  Yeah, so you decided to come in and give us all the flu just in time for the holidays,  which is always a treat.  So thank you to Jimmy.  Perfect.  No, he had a date with, not a date.  He was going to go to dinner with a Playboy model last night, and he had the runs, and  he had to cancel.  I had to cancel because I was on the cab.  Okay, so was that like one of these major anxiety, I have a date with a Playboy bunny? 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  It was actually being sick.  It wasn't going to be a fool around date, so there was no pressure.  It was just to eat.  But no, no, I was legitimately sick.  Oh.  Thanks.  Not being a fool around date kind of confuses us all in the studio just because, you know,  it's a Playboy thing.  Also, you don't know what's going to transpire at that point.  You're about to eat with somebody without anything happening?  Yeah, no, I'm saying that, but you never know maybe the next step or the next time you  go out or something.  You just don't know.  Was she hoping?  Any day that you guys can get Jim Norton on the air to use the word gumption is a 
[01:21:30]  good thing.  Did he say gumption?  How did that get past me?  Well, we were trying to forget that we heard it.  Jim Norton's grandfather's here today.  Gumption, right.  Hey, put some elbow grease into it.  Dennis, what are you doing for the big Christmas holiday there?  I am just getting done digging out from all the snow, and I'm getting ready to go skate  on my rink.  Wow.  It's one degree here, literally. 
[01:22:00]  One.  Wow.  It's one out.  You're almost completely out of degrees.  I'm almost at zero.  Wait, do you have your own ice rink?  I do, yeah.  I have an outdoor rink, yeah.  Is it covered at least, or do you have to like...  No, no, no, no.  It's real old school like this.  You can't get much more old school than this.  Oh, you're going to have the lumpy ice then.  Well, no, it's not lumpy because we get up like morons early in the morning and we scrape  it down, and then we hose it down with water.  He's probably got one of those little cars that he turned into a Zamboni. 
[01:22:30]  I do.  I have a little tractor that has a Zamboni thing with water on the back.  How cool is that?  That's big.  It was okay.  Look it, look it.  At one point in my life, that could have been a bong.  But I, you know, I'm going to switch it up so that I, actually, I could probably still  turn it into a bong.  But, you know, I'm trying to do some physical exercise here, all right?  Are you guys going to have a game of hockey today with the family?  Yeah, but, man, it's going to be cold.  Do you get to check, like, your hand into the boards or anything?  Yeah, this is one of those mornings where it's so cold, you're trying to set an example 
[01:23:00]  to the kids, like, let's go out there and show some gumption.  I may actually 15 minutes into this one have to go, you know what, this is stupid.  Let's go in the house where it's warm.  Come on.  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm in Connecticut.  Oh, okay.  Can I ask a question?  Dan is David Tell.  Hey, Dave.  Hey, who do you play?  Do you, like, play like a, like, you know, like a school of orphans, a culinary school?  Like, what do you do?  It's a bunch of friends of mine.  Some of the guys are firefighters.  Some of the guys are broken down hockey players.  And then, you know, the truth is, it's like our kids, like my son and the other sons, they 
[01:23:30]  just beat our asses now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we just smoke and drink coffee and they just beat our asses.  And you make believe you're not trying.  Yeah.  That's a cool image of skating and smoking.  You guys are like the, like the Kennedys were with football.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Only with hockey.  We're like the Kennedys with football, except way less money.  And absolutely no influence.  And we don't drive people off bridges.  Yeah, folks.  Whoa.  Whoa, hey. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, what?  Like, I can't mention, like, that didn't happen?  Yeah, what?  Not much time.  What happened?  I'm going from gumption.  Word of the day is gumption.  How's the book doing, man?  Hey, it's doing good.  I'm stuck at number seven.  But, hey, no complaints.  Listen, I got to tell you guys, on Thursday night in New Jersey, was it New Jersey Thursday  night or Connecticut?  I can't remember anything now.  Oh, whatever.  Thursday's book sign.  Thursday night, I think it was, no, it was Jersey. 
[01:24:30]  Thursday night in Jersey.  There was probably 300 people there.  I'm not kidding you.  I mean, I couldn't keep tabs because I was signing one after the other.  There was at least somewhere between 30 and 40 Jim Norton books just from that thing that  was on the air.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, we told people to show the Norton book at the Dennis Leary signing.  Nice.  And you had a hog drawn on your face?  Yeah.  Yeah, the idea was if they buy my book and Jim's book, I would sign Jim's cover and draw  a hog on his face.  Are you good at drawing the hog?  I got pretty good at it because I had to do it like 30 times, you know? 
[01:25:00]  So that was Thursday.  On Saturday, I had two book signings.  One was at a really small bookstore called The Hickory Stick, which is like locally here.  It was a great little bookstore.  They had about, I guess, 150 people, and they sold out of the Jim Norton book.  And like the first 15 people in line, they only had about 10 copies.  Nice.  I mean, they wanted nothing to do with it.  They had more than 10 copies.  Well, they don't have more.  I mean, literally, if you're not doing a signing there, they don't have more. 
[01:25:30]  They're so small, they have about maybe a bestseller at any given moment might have 15 copies.  I mean, they're tiny.  Yeah.  Right?  So then I went to the big famous one, R.J.  Julia, in Connecticut that night in Madison, Connecticut.  And that was like, that was huge.  That was like 350 people.  And there must have been, I mean, at least, you know, another 40 or 50 books, Jim Norton books there.  And it got so crazy that at one point I drew a hog and signed the cover of your book. 
[01:26:00]  And the lady came back and she's like, listen, can you, can the penis, it's kind of smudged.  Can you redraw it?  I was like, wait a minute.  I'm redrawing a penis on your woman's face?  I didn't do it the right way?  Wouldn't be the first time.  Teehee.  The first time it left a smudge, too.  I'm just telling you guys, man, you guys, this is the way to sell books, you know?  Yeah, it's all radio.  Are you trying to say that we're popular?  Because if you are, why don't you tell the bosses?  Because they're not really sure of that yet.  I'm telling you and your bosses, I don't know how to explain it any better, but you guys are the anti-Oprah. 
[01:26:30]  If you guys tell, if David Tell writes a book tomorrow, right, and you guys tell people to go out and buy it,  not only are they going to go out and buy it, but if you say, I don't care what other book, Joe the Plumber's new book,  if you say, hey, buy Joe the Plumber's book and we'll draw penises on his face, they're going to do it.  Yeah.  Well, I'm working with Sarah Palin's baby on a book.  It's called Don't Eat That.  What do you get, Dennis, what do you get if you make number one? 
[01:27:00]  Like, do you get, like, is there, like, a prize or, like, if you're a number one, like, for a certain, besides the money, is there, like...  Oh, that's a good question.  That's a good question.  Does Solomon Rushdie, like, take a bath?  Like, what do you get?  Is there some kind of book?  I'm only at seven.  Artie Lang got the number two, so he might have the inside information about what you get.  Didn't he get to number one?  Did he get to number one?  Yeah, I think he did.  Oh, man.  Hey, but you're beating out the Obama books, right?  I'm beating the Obama books.  See, that's a good thing.  You know what, though?  Lucky us, we get a topless picture of Obama on all the front pages of the newspapers today, and it says, 
[01:27:30]  Fit for office.  Buff Bam is a Hawaiian hunk.  Buff Bam.  Can I say it again?  President B-Cup?  Yeah, he's...  I like how he's letting his rack out like that.  Look at that.  He's got baloney boobs, and they're saying he's buff.  Dave's calling him President B-Cup?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Wow.  But David tells...  Sorry, is that bad, or...?  No, no, I'm just wondering.  That kind of throws some interesting light onto your psychological approach to Obama.  Yeah, no, I think he's a good-looking man.  You do? 
[01:28:00]  Well, you know, he's really Filipino, so, I mean, you know, he could be a, you know, fancy  boy, or, you know what I'm saying?  You've been overseas, haven't you?  I remember in Chapter 9, you said that...  Dave's got a little fantasy going on about the president.  No, I like how, you know, he's like, we were saying it before, how, you know, he's going  to be the guy who's like, anything he does is going to be like this big moment, you know,  people are going to watch him, you know, drink a coffee at the mall, you know, whatever.  I think he's going to be out a lot.  He's not going to be at the White House.  It's going to be hard to criticize him, because if that was another president-elect that was 
[01:28:30]  walking topless like that, and did have kind of breasts, they would have commented on it  in the paper.  They would have said like, wow, he looks like he's going to be the breast president we've  ever had, you know, dope post-headline or something.  But they just say, wow, look how in shape he is, our buff president.  Well, what else do you want him to say?  He's in shape.  I want him to say what they would say normally if it was somebody that they would criticize. 
[01:29:00]  They just don't criticize the guy.  Like who?  Like any politician whatsoever, they would criticize.  Well, they had fun with Ted Kennedy when he was walking around with his suit on.  This is your post-Bush cry-based syndrome.  I wish.  It's complete honesty.  What?  It's complete honesty.  And you're blinded, Dennis, that this guy is Teflon.  No one will criticize him.  Oh, really?  Yes. 
[01:29:30]  Come on.  No, the media loves this guy and will not criticize him.  Yeah, well, what do you want them to do?  They're kicking the other guy to the curb.  The guy's got a 17% approval rating.  And this guy hasn't even really come into office yet.  You've got to give him three months with the economic situation we have, and it's going  to be a whole different set of coverage.  Believe me.  Okay?  Dennis, you're pro shoe-throwing then.  I'm pro what?  Shoe-throwing.  You believe a man should express himself with his shoes.  It's funny to me that some of the great leaders of the past, or somebody's decided to shoot. 
[01:30:00]  This guy, they throw shoes at.  I mean, it's unbelievable to me.  But in their culture, that's like the ultimate insult.  I don't care what culture we're talking about.  The ultimate insult is actually, you know, taking a shot at the guy, not with your shoe.  So, I mean, hey, to me, I think it's a great idea that if politicians are going to speak  in public and we disagree, we all throw our shoes at them.  But I think pie is better.  I think pie is much more effective.  If you hit a guy with a pie, hey, he's covered in pie. 
[01:30:30]  It's timeless.  Yeah, that's more insulting than a shoe whizzing by your head.  You're right.  Try to continue the press conference with pie on your face.  It's like, yeah, I mean, everything from Fatty Arbuckle on, pie has always been funny.  I just can't get over the fact that he was having a lot of fun with the shoe throwing.  Yeah, I think that was pretty cool.  He was really into the second throw.  Like, he was like, come on.  I know.  He really thought it was funny.  Yeah, he was having a good time with it.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, I like that they keep saying, like, it is a big insult in that culture.  Like, what culture isn't? 
[01:31:00]  I know.  When a guy throws two shoes at your face.  It's a compliment.  Yeah.  It's not good anywhere.  Well, listen, guys, I've got to roll.  I've got to go get beat by my kids.  Yeah, you've got to do a little ice skating.  Bundle up.  Hey, guys, thanks a lot.  I'm telling you, like I said, somebody's got to start giving you guys credit for selling books  because you've got inroads there, you know?  Nice.  Cool, man.  Yeah, we'll see how that pans out.  Well, he's an early dad.  What time do you get up, man?  I get up really early. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  I'm used to the rest of your schedule.  We have to get up at, like, 5.30 in the morning, you know?  What time is your hockey going to start today?  It's going to start as soon as I get down there.  It's going to start yelling at these kids.  Oh, wow.  That's the only upper hand I have now is I can yell at them, and I pay their tuition,  so they have to listen to me.  Dennis has gumption.  They have to let you score a few, huh?  He's an early dad.  I don't know if it's going to be gumption, boys.  It's so cold out, I think it's going to be, I'm going to have to switch into another mode,  not gumption.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cold out.  All right.  Yeah, it's cold out.  All right, Dennis.  Have a nice holiday, man.  Hey, guys, happy Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, whatever the hell you want to call it. 
[01:32:00]  They'll leave us goths and Wiccans out.  Go ahead.  All the bases.  I'll see you after the new year.  All right.  Have a good one, man.  There goes Dennis Leary.  Thank you, Kenny, for my gift.  He told me not to open until Christmas.  You opened it?  Yes, I did.  You weren't supposed to.  What is it?  It's too bad.  What is it?  Some money.  It might just be money.  Yeah, your assistant gave you your money back?  What do you mean money?  It's a gift card.  For what?  Something good?  Or just a debit one. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, it's like whatever you want.  Yeah.  How much is on it?  200 bucks.  That's pretty good.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Now you're going to have to get lost three times.  I wonder if he said don't open until Christmas because they're different amounts for everybody,  depending on how much he likes people.  No, they're the same.  It'll be 200, 200, and 35,000.  We should start our insult.  We throw our old merch at each other.  I hate to get hit with so many Voss CDs.  Yeah.  No money left. 
[01:33:00]  Anyway, I got a very happy story.  It's the holiday season.  Nice.  Okay.  We're going to change gears a little bit and give the people a nice little story today.  Okay?  Listen to this.  A medical miracle.  A nine-year-old Texas boy suffered a horrible injury, but he survived against the slimmest of odds.  Jordan Taylor is able to do things most nine-year-old boys like to do.  But three months ago, doctors said Jordan had a one to two percent chance of survival. 
[01:33:30]  And I just kept screaming.  I just wanted him to wake up.  Jordan's mother, Stacy Perez, was behind the wheel when a dump truck ran a stop sign plowing into her car.  Jordan was buckled up in the back seat, but the impact caused an unthinkable injury.  The energy basically made his head lift up off of his neck and then move forward.  It's called orthopedic decapitation.  Jordan's spinal cord remained intact, but his skull separated from his neck. 
[01:34:00]  All of the connective tissue that essentially keeps your head connected to your neck was destroyed.  I do remember seeing him in the car and his head was just kind of hanging down.  Doctors were able to reattach his skull with a metal plate and titanium rods, giving hope back to a boy who has defied the odds.  Sounds to me like he's a very bad boy.  I don't think the reporters should be laughing like that. 
[01:34:30]  It's a horrible, horrible story.  So it was a one to two percent chance of survival.  How do you tell that, like, you know, one percent, two percent if I don't show up drunk?  Yeah, yeah.  That was what got old Dale Earnhardt.  Really?  Same injury, yeah.  Decapitation?  Yeah, one of those orthopedic decapitations, they call it, yeah.  It's where just pretty much the skin is holding your head on.  How much is that?  Are you awake after that or are you done? 
[01:35:00]  I think you're pretty much unconscious.  I don't know, but if you wear a neck brace, it's not going to, like, fix itself or anything.  You just can never move.  Take a Tylenol.  It'll fix you up.  So he's, like, flopping around like his head.  Yeah, he always looks like he's being indifferent.  He's doing, like, a Gleason.  The head's going back and forth.  I wonder if he could turn his head completely around.  No, because the skin would probably...  It would look like he's making a balloon animal with his neck.  And this guy's not writing a book? 
[01:35:30]  He's only nine.  Give him a few years.  But he sounds very fresh.  A pop-up?  Oh, God.  You open it in the head, it flops out.  Stupidly creeps everybody in the bookstore.  But he's okay, right?  I mean...  Yeah.  Apparently he defied the odds with some titanium rods and plates and whatever else they do.  But he's got to be paralyzed, right?  No.  No.  What do you mean, no?  Spinal cord's fine.  Yeah, he said the spinal cord.  That's pretty good.  Wait, no.  Tell me more on that story. 
[01:36:00]  That's got to swell up your spinal cord once that starts happening.  No, spinal cord's fine.  His skull just got knocked right off by the impact.  Yeah, but what happens to the...  He put it right back on.  The...  No.  Come on.  The duodum.  No.  What happens to your spinal cord?  It stays there.  It doesn't move.  But what happens...  I mean, the bones could, like, kind of rip it a little bit.  And then it bruises it and it swells up.  Yeah.  It didn't happen, though.  Maybe he got paralyzed.  In that African color where they put the rings around your neck, that thing? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Couldn't they do that to him?  Oh, yeah.  They break their neck when they do that.  Yeah.  Don't they?  Or...  Yeah, their neck actually...  Yeah.  Breaks a little bit.  Yeah.  So if they took those rings off, their heads would just go...  Couldn't they hammer his head back on with a shoe?  You're wrong about Dale Earnhardt, but first Dan and Jersey.  No, I'm not.  Shut up.  I know I'm not wrong.  Shut up.  Well, we're not going there yet.  This is the warm-up call.  Dan and Jersey.  Yes, Dan.  Oh, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Big fan listening to you guys for many, many years, man. 
[01:37:00]  Dude, how do you guys play that last track behind that, man?  That is extremely uncomfortable when you guys did that.  That's terrible, man.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah, I felt like terrible listening to it.  You're right.  You guys, you pressed the button, dude.  Yeah, I know.  Who did?  Who did?  We're like a firing squad here.  One person has an empty magazine, so we never know who the guy is that shot the guy.  That's right.  It keeps everyone sane.  We don't know who pushed the button.  That's right.  Who pushed the button?  That's right.  Turn your key, sir. 
[01:37:30]  Don't have plugs.  We know you pressed it, have plugs.  I did not.  And it's not plugs.  They're follicles.  They're restoration follicles.  That's right.  That's terrible, guys.  It really is.  I like it.  It was Christmas.  It's not terrible.  It's a feel-good story.  It's a feel-good story.  That's right.  A feel-good story.  Were you guys playing laptop?  It was a nervous titter.  That's right.  It's a feel-good story because, you know, it's a little rough for everybody out there.  And what we're trying to do is show you that it could be a lot worse.  He made it.  A very bad boy who got his comeuppance. 
[01:38:00]  We're laughing because we don't know the dude.  And we're all like that.  You just don't want to admit it.  Come on.  You guys don't have kids.  You don't know, man.  Oh, no.  Stop it with your stupid kids.  I do have kids.  Well, you go home and you kiss them on the neck.  I asked my daughter, man.  I know what it's like to lose a kid.  No, you didn't.  I'm going to say that stuff, man.  No, you didn't.  You did not.  Yes, I did.  I'm sorry.  I did, dude.  We're really sorry about that.  Did you play the Bornyord noises?  Well, this kid lived, though.  No, it's not.  We're really sorry.  Follicles. 
[01:38:30]  We're sorry to hear that, Dan.  This kid is all right.  I lost this kid.  I'm sorry, Dan.  I know.  Ope's got some heart, man.  That's right, I do.  I sure do.  Are you out of your mind?  Hey, he speaks the truth.  Dude, you have no clue.  Dan, I do have a heart.  I do have a clue.  How many years ago did that happen?  My daughter, too.  Oh.  Okay, see?  That wasn't me.  Oh, boy.  That wasn't me.  No, that was Ope, man.  I know that.  See?  So now tell me who's... 
[01:39:00]  Wait a minute.  We were just friends, Dan.  How are you turning your back on me like this?  No, come on.  Ope, I know you take advantage of a situation like this, you cake-stomping bastard.  See?  In this economy, you know?  Are people going to be surprised to learn that that time it was Anthony?  No, it wasn't.  I don't even have a laugh.  Look, here's all my sounds.  It's every sound and every bang.  There it is.  Did you hear one laugh?  Come on, I've listened long enough. 
[01:39:30]  I know the game, guys.  I know the game.  All right, Dan.  All right.  You know, when the situation's down really bad, Ope's the first one to take advantage  and say something nasty.  Exactly.  But you just said I'm the nice guy with the heart.  He didn't say that.  Well, I believed you were being nice for a minute, Dan.  But when you asked me that question and the last track came, I know it must have been you.  Dan, I feel bad for you and you're lost, but you're a dummy.  Yeah.  Who is?  Why are you calling him a dummy?  Because he's a dummy.  Yeah, at least he didn't get hair plucked.  It's not.  They're follicles.  Hair restoration. 
[01:40:00]  Separate follicles.  Individually placed.  And where do they get the follicles?  What do you want?  From the harvest area.  The cadaver pubes.  You can pluck your hair with a mug like that.  What?  Oh, Dan.  Now you've gone too far.  I'm a handsome son of a bitch.  He has sex with 20-year-olds.  Yeah.  Hey, fellas.  Keep it on the ice.  Keep it on the ice.  What's the matter, Dan?  What's the matter, Dan?  You know what upsets me?  Dan doesn't find me attractive. 
[01:40:30]  Aw, what a shame.  You know, in a few years I would have been banging your daughter.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  See?  Ah, go screw Dan!  Wow.  I didn't say you, God.  I'm going to let you bang me.  I didn't say you.  Oh, my God.  Dan, I got to say, we've gone way too far.  I was just having a little fun.  Shut up.  And now Anthony's taking it to a whole nother level.  Shut it.  I don't know what goes on in his head.  It's no fault.  Don't you start bashing me. 
[01:41:00]  I'll bash right back with a howitzer, you son of a bitch.  How was it throwing the toys away?  Oh.  Shut up.  I don't care.  Wow.  The guy fired the first shot.  I was being nice.  Go screw yourself.  Hey, it's the end of the year.  What?  You know what?  You're lucky.  I got a real sick sense of humor and that I'm not where you guys are because I'd kick  your puny ass.  Yeah, go try it, my friend.  Try it.  Yeah, I know.  Big dumb Kenny. 
[01:41:30]  Big dumb Kenny.  Big dumb Kenny.  No.  My bodyguard, Smith & Wesson.  You know what you're carrying right now.  Well.  X and A on the carrying day.  Dan, why don't you come down to Caroline's?  You're talking over like...  Yeah, go to Caroline's.  Yeah, we're all going to meet at Caroline's and bring this back together with David Tell.  That was the most uncomfortable moment of the year.  Yeah.  Don't bash me.  Peace out, man.  Merry Christmas, dude.  Merry Christmas, Dan. 
[01:42:00]  Thank you, Dan.  Legendary hair plugs.  All right, Dan.  Last presents under the tree.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Wow.  Will you let him have the final words?  No.  That was an excellent salvo.  Dan, sorry for your loss, my friend.  It's a holiday show.  So, what's next?  Yeah, this is our holiday show, Ed.  Merry Christmas.  This is our holiday show.  Get the head of Unicef on.  Tell him times are tough.  We're not sending anything over.  Jesus.  What the hell, man?  And you're wrong about Dale Earnhardt.  I know I'm not. 
[01:42:30]  I saw a whole show on this.  Ryan, Minnesota.  Go ahead, Ryan.  Well, actually, that's technically not what happened.  It's when your brain bounced off the front of your skull from the forward momentum when you stopped.  Right.  And then it bounces back and rises up the back of your skull.  Yeah, see, everyone knows that, Ed.  His skull was separated from his spine.  I know the Hans device broke down, but before, when he hit at 180 miles an hour, his brain bounced off the front of his skull.  All those NASCAR fans know that, Ed.  Okay, but he also...  There's an actual term for it. 
[01:43:00]  Have stunt, dude.  Look it up.  You really should.  But his head, his skull, came away from his spine.  Right.  That's all I said.  Is that...  Are you sure?  I think you're right, dude.  No, you're right.  Right.  All right, you're right.  All right.  I'll get...  You know, Dan took a pretty bad beating, so I'll give Ryan this one.  All right, listen.  Okay, you're right.  Listen, we horrified a lot.  Why don't you reenact it?  We horrified a lot of people, so I just want to bring everyone back together by telling  everyone out there that the dog dies in the end, as far as the Marley and Me movie goes. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, my...  So, that should bring everyone back together.  I just throw myself out a window.  I hope it eats a bag of Owen Wilson's heroin.  Oh, this is not a nice show today.  That should bring it back.  Marley, he dies.  Dump Percy Lips.  Yeah, the dog dies.  So, that should bring everyone back together.  That's great.  Good.  Now, we're all on the same page again.  David Tell, Caroline's, the 26th with the 30th.  What's the point?  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  We're going to break and getting some more food from Basil Tees and where? 
[01:44:00]  Tom's River, right?  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Look, we're back to festive now after that last break.  Opie and Anthony hanging with David Tell today.  It's going to be at Caroline's.  On Broadway.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  You're the 26th through the 30th for Mr. Tell.  What else is going on in your mind there, Dave?  We were talking about the brain thing again. 
[01:44:30]  If he had used the device, that wouldn't have happened to him.  Oh, Deller and Hart.  Yeah, yeah.  That little device that clips like your helmet.  No, the other device, the brake.  Oh.  It would be more reasonable instead of going for it.  Wow.  NASCAR people are going to be really upset with you, Dave.  I'm sorry about that.  We don't care.  No, that's a big part of my audience.  Yeah.  If you didn't drive 200 miles an hour in a circle, I wonder why he hit something.  How about this?  Stop it.  There's a lot of money in that driving in a circle.  Why?  It's a dumb sport.  Millions and millions of dollars. 
[01:45:00]  A lot of people are watching it.  It's the fastest growing sport in America, Jimmy.  And yes, they do call it a sport.  It's not a sport.  I don't think it's a sport.  It's a spectacle.  It's an attraction.  I wouldn't call it a sport, though.  It's a vroom, vroom.  And don't tell me that they have to be athletes and in shape.  They do.  I understand there's a lot of rigors that go along.  Rigors that go along with auto racing like this.  But I don't consider it athletic.  It's not athletic at all. 
[01:45:30]  I drive on a daily basis like a maniac.  For hours on end sometimes, see?  Only I make left turns.  Occasionally.  Yeah, I don't know.  Growing up on Long Island, I believe we used to have the monster truck show occasionally.  But we never had, like, you know, I guess, what is it, triple A or double A NASCAR-isms.  You know, I feel left out.  We got that tiny, tiny little track out in Riverhead.  Riverhead Raceway. 
[01:46:00]  It's got to be like a, it's not even a quarter mile.  Yeah.  It's got to be like an eight couple mile around.  Those are where people are, like, dying every weekend somewhere in the country racing those horrible little circuits.  Yeah.  Street racing.  No?  Street racing?  Oh, yeah.  I'm all about the street racing.  It's big overseas, I think.  Yeah.  The Tokyo Drift movie.  The Tokyo Drift.  You got it.  Die Hard Part 5.  That drifting is so stupid.  Yeah, what is that, anyway?  It is the dumbest friggin', it's where you're racing and just sliding the whole time. 
[01:46:30]  You're pretty much cutting your wheels in the opposite direction, sliding around corners in some, one of those cars that you only see Hispanic guys driving around here.  It's like, yeah, that Toyota Celica really needed that spoiler.  Got to keep that thing on the ground doing 60 miles an hour, huh?  With the big fart pipe in the back, the gold rims, the spoiler, the hood scoop, the Jesus Christ stencil headlights. 
[01:47:00]  I hate seeing those cars.  And you just know when you pull up, you just look over and go, I knew it.  You do.  They love those cars.  How about less racism in the new year?  Right?  Just a little bit.  It's easy for me.  I just got to cut down, like, one thing.  Yeah.  Of course it's easy, because you couldn't possibly have more.  You can only go with less.  Right.  I'm not a racist.  I don't think.  No.  No. 
[01:47:30]  I'll think it over.  Is that, like, a resolution, or just a...  I don't care what he does, to be honest with you.  No, I'm saying good radio.  That would be, like, a really, like, cool...  I've been called racist a lot, but I'm just...  I'm pretty much a...  I think I'm more a separatist than a racist.  Yeah.  Well, you know, David Blaine, not to switch topics, but...  Is a racist?  I doubt it.  I don't think magicians...  Are they any particular...  Aren't they, like, from a magical...  Yeah, magical place.  Atlantis, I believe, is where they're all from, originally.  It's true.  They were racist.  They'd be making people of other races disappear.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  You would know if he was a racist.  The amazing subprime loan man.  Yeah.  Ta-da!  There's no more Jews.  That's good.  No, I think he was giving away his, like, for the homeless, whatever, he was giving away  his jacket, and, you know, getting other people to do it by doing close-up magic until  they were annoyed.  Like, just give me your jacket.  That's, like, a cool, like, you know, hey, I'm, you know, helping people.  That was real nice of him.  He gave up his jacket.  He could buy, I assume, a million jackets, but that's nice. 
[01:48:30]  I'm sure he had a new jacket an hour later.  That's a real celebrity one.  Like, you could fix the problem in a second with your money, but it's better to, like,  get people with a tune or, like, annoy them.  And, you know, he doesn't...  It probably wasn't even a warm jacket.  Right.  Like, it's more for looks than warmth because he never has to be in the cold.  Like, it goes from the venue to the limo to the hotel.  So, it's, like, it's probably some thin little...  He's probably in the market for a new...  I'm still freezing.  He's in the market for a new jacket and said, ah, you know, the dumb media will pick up 
[01:49:00]  on this, so I'll give out my old jacket on the way to get my new jacket.  Well...  Hey, hold on.  Chris, the trucker, wants to argue that NASCAR is indeed a sport.  Chris, what are you hauling?  Oh, right now we are hauling Costco Freight.  Ah.  It's a miscellaneous thing.  A lot of stuff.  A lot of different things.  Back it up, Big Bear.  There ain't nobody.  Exactly. 
[01:49:30]  So, I just want to...  I mean, NASCAR is a sport, you know?  You got to go 500 miles, 200 miles an hour.  You know?  And it's all about pit and stuff, so it's all about, you know, tech or whatever you want  to say.  But, um, it is a sport.  It's not.  I mean, they got to wake up, they got to go drive, they got to go to meetings, they got  to do all their sponsorship stuff.  None of those things are sports things.  Yeah.  Waking up is a person thing.  You got to go drive.  Well, yeah, so do I.  And they got to go to meetings.  So do I.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, see, you guys are right. 
[01:50:00]  It's not like golf.  Golf.  You got to say golf is a sport, but those guys put so many hours and time into their sport to  get to where they're at.  And same with NASCAR.  They start, like, when they're 13, 14, 15-year-olds, you know, doing go-karts and moving on up.  Chris, I'm a big golf fan.  They're making money and it's putting food on the plate, right?  I'm a big golf fan.  I think golf is more of a sport than NASCAR.  No, I agree with you.  And saying golf is a sport might be, you know, pushing it a little bit.  Too much machinery involved in NASCAR for it to be a sport, I would say.  We did this bit with Patrice O'Neill. 
[01:50:30]  To be a sport, you need some kind of defense.  Well, you do get defense.  You get people blocking you when you're trying to pass them.  No, you need, like, cars coming the other way would be a real defense.  Oh, you mean like cars coming the other way?  Like an intersection that occasionally machines run from the hood.  We argue to make golf a sport that someone could come running out of the wood.  Why don't you just keep effing talking?  He's a trucker.  So you would redesign NASCAR where there's, like, a wild card? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, just one car coming at you would make it a sport because now you're, like, there's a defense that you have to get around.  Yeah, and we argue with golf, like, if someone was able to run out of the woods and attempt to tackle you as you're trying to make a golf shot, that would officially turn it into a sport.  Yeah.  You know, that type of thing.  I get it.  Am I getting called out today at every turn?  Thank you, Chris.  I'm sorry I yelled at you.  I got one more thing to say.  Okay, go, Chris.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  No, go ahead.  Tell us.  Good to go, man.  What were you going to say? 
[01:51:30]  Keep her between the ditches.  We said go ahead.  Corey, Atlanta, how are you?  Hi, what's going on over there?  All right.  Obviously, I'm an idiot.  I want to let Anthony know he went to a professional drift event, not the Tokyo Drift Craft that's on TV, but a professional event.  It's absolutely exciting.  It's a lot of skill required.  And, like, at Road Atlanta, they come into the first turn 100 miles an hour, completely sideways.  You try that in your Mustang.  No.  Would you try it in your Mustang on the track, though, Anderson? 
[01:52:00]  No.  Would you try drifting?  Actually, in my Mustang, all it has to do is be drizzling, and I'll do that.  Oh, really?  Well, you know, you don't buy it for the wet roads.  Would you try drifting?  Like, would you be a passenger in one of these cars?  I can barely drive.  I mean, I only rent cars, and it's really, like, from the airport to the hotel is like a relearning experience.  Really?  To get out of it, that's like my Baghdad Highway.  I mean, anything can happen there.  The Highway of Jeff.  Yeah, it is.  It's like anybody, you know, I'm adjusting mirrors, I'm lighting cigarettes. 
[01:52:30]  You're a true New Yorker.  Yes.  A lot of New Yorkers just don't know how to drive because there's no reason to.  Yeah, I think I've been spoiled.  You know, I'm missing out on all these great things.  What was the Tokyo?  Tokyo Drifting.  That thing.  But a professional drifting event.  But what about the pit crew?  Like, when do they really get out of it?  I mean, at the end of the day, like, what are they, like, we're part of a team, but you're, like, really the, like, nobody really knows you.  No recognition.  You're the tire changer.  At least, like, you know, when they bring out the defense, you know, like the whatever during football, you're like, oh, these guys, you know.  But you know what it is?  You're almost like the guy that does the books for the Giants. 
[01:53:00]  He gets a Super Bowl ring, too.  Oh, really?  So they walk around.  It's like, you got a Super Bowl ring, but, hey, come on.  You do the books.  You do the finances.  All right, Corey, thanks.  How do you get into that?  I would check out that drifting thing, though.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, here's a...  Everybody wants to be a driver.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, no.  Go ahead, Dave.  No, everyone wants to be a driver, but, like, is that, like, some kid's, like, very small dream?  You know, it's like, I just want to be a part of it.  You know, just like the wheel guy at first, and, you know, with the brr, brr thing.  You know they all wanted to be the driver. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I assume that, yeah.  It's like you fall into being the brr, brr, brr.  Yeah, I hear that.  One of the fuel guy, the guy that's got to fuel up the car.  Let's say hi to Richie in Brooklyn, still on NASCAR.  Richie, what do you say?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  A big fan of you.  Thank you.  I just want to say NASCAR is not a sport because you got Jimmy Spencer, one of the drivers that drives around, like, 200 miles, smokes cigarettes in the car.  He's smoking during the race?  Who's this guy?  Yeah, Jimmy Spencer. 
[01:54:00]  He's a NASCAR driver.  Hold on.  There's no way you're allowed to smoke in the car when you're racing.  Yeah, he smokes.  You know, they stop races because he throws the cigarettes out the car.  There is no way this guy smokes in the car.  Look that up.  There is.  That's got to be a rule in NASCAR that you cannot smoke in the car.  That's amazing.  They do it.  Oh, this guy's cool.  There's so much gas all over the place.  Yeah, if there was an accident or the fuel, there's just too many.  I don't know if you're telling the truth. 
[01:54:30]  He must be like a self-taught.  That's why a lot of guys, hey, he crashes into cars because they say, oh, you must have been smoking in the car, and they catch him smoking.  You see the smoke coming out.  He's like the cool hand Luke.  He throws his own.  He's staring out the window.  He goes back into the back window.  All right, thank you.  All right, punch it out, guys.  That's probably because he grew up smoking as he was driving.  It's like that's his comfort zone.  That's his thing.  He's the John Daly of NASCAR.  What is his thing?  Better that than the corn car?  I almost got the F-bop.  I was like, you could just picture a NASCAR car with a big full ashtray, ashes all over the floorboards. 
[01:55:00]  That would roll, let's say.  A little yellow tree hanging from the rear view.  Baby C thinks.  Baby C.  Let's say hi to Jude on Long Island.  Jude.  Two things.  There was the guy that was shooting heroin and doing the truck racing, and I wanted to know if Anthony thought poker was a sport.  Yeah, is poker a sport?  Poker is not a sport.  They call it a sport on ESPN, my friend.  It's a game.  Poker is a game that you play.  They call it a sport on ESPN. 
[01:55:30]  There are games you play.  There are sports.  And then there are, like, spectacles.  Which, uh...  Games of chance.  Yeah, yeah, things like that.  I think bowling is a game.  I don't think it's a sport.  I think bowling is a game.  Auto racing is a spectacle.  What about auto racing on heroin?  Right.  Yeah, auto racing on heroin.  That is...  That's a different level, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, there was a guy a couple of months ago that got caught for shooting dope and racing trucks. 
[01:56:00]  Look it up.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Look it up.  Wait, he's in the truck rally and he's a Ford in the H?  I don't...  Yeah, what the...  Come on.  I thought it'd be meth or something.  No money.  It's like, you're on Vicodin.  Yeah.  Don't let that get out.  It'll ruin the whole mystique.  Yeah, he's picking the wrong substance there.  Matt in Virginia.  Yeah, of course they smoked in the car.  Up until four years ago, it was the Winston Cup.  Wow.  That's right.  Let's not forget about the Winston Cup.  That's a bad-ass brand.  Trying to, yeah, keep the sponsor in there. 
[01:56:30]  Pat and Philly, if you sit in a car, it's not a sport.  Fontaine, I race almost every weekend.  It's not a sport.  It's not a sport.  No.  Jimmy Spencer hasn't raced for six years.  Is he the smoking dude?  Yeah.  Oh, he hasn't even raced in six years?  Scott the truck.  I've been a race car driver.  Right.  I love driving cars and smoking.  Now I can't even drive myself to the doctor's office.  Let's hook the carburetor tube up to his throat. 
[01:57:00]  Sure.  That is cool.  Hey, Scott, what are you hauling?  Food for the airlines.  Food for the airlines.  Yum, yum.  How do you live with yourself?  You call it food?  Yeah, I don't call it food.  Food for the airlines.  Sky Chef.  Jeez.  Nice.  Exactly.  Sky Chef and Gate Gourmet.  Sky and Gate Gourmet.  Don't throw Chef and Gourmet in with that whole thing.  Right, right.  Like, how the hell do they get away with that?  What about the plane that skidded off?  How come that's not a sport? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that's a drift.  That was drifting.  Oh, my God, 737 drifting.  It's a new sport in Denver.  Isn't that going to be like a new thing for, like, rich people or something?  Get a jet and wreck it?  That's right.  Continental drift.  David Tell.  You said that might have been a brake problem there, brake failure or landing gear failure.  Really?  Yeah.  You don't need brakes when you're taking off, though.  Well, apparently, if they go on when you're taking off.  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah, the wheel might have locked up and they just made a sharp turn off the runway. 
[01:58:00]  That's a, they made a mistake, right?  The pilot error?  You've got to think pilot error on that.  It could have been mechanical.  It's rarely mechanical, but it could have been mechanical.  Something could have just locked up.  Yeah.  Which will turn out to be, like, human error because a mechanic didn't.  And here, this just goes to show you, when the economy's bad, they got cut corners somewhere.  We hinted.  And you don't want it to be in maintenance of the aircraft.  We hinted about that a mere week or two ago.  You don't want a guy looking at the brakes and going, ah, I could wait another takeoff 
[01:58:30]  and landing.  We'll do it when it gets to Houston.  Yeah.  But isn't that like the, you know, not that there's a good crash, but that's the best one  where you're still on the ground.  You didn't even take, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  You're still, like, you know, like, in your element.  You're still there.  It's snow on the ground, so you're kind of like a toboggan.  Yeah.  You're tobogganing a little bit.  You're already sizing everything up.  Who are you going to push out of the way?  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit of time to think about it, but not too much like you're plummeting.  Yeah.  So you can just, where's the exit?  Did you hear about the lady?  Dave? 
[01:59:00]  No.  The fat lady, the fat slob, was supposed to be the first out of the airplane, and she  was deciding if she was going to leave or not because her husband was still sitting in  his seat.  She said, I was waiting in the aisle for my husband.  And it's like, excuse me.  That's why people end up burning alive because of stupid people like that.  Some guy got on Twitter right after the crash.  He got on Twitter and just started talking.  He goes, holy S, I was just in a mother plane crash. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  And people were like, oh, Jesus.  And then he was talking about the whole thing.  What happened?  He goes, the guy at the emergency door on the left was Johnny on the spot because he  had the thing opened immediately.  Cool.  He knew what he was doing.  Yeah, yeah.  And people were just jumping out that onto the wing and then got out.  But to have everybody live.  Was there screaming?  I mean, like, what do you think?  I would say there was probably some screaming.  I would say there was.  A little bit of screaming.  He said they felt a takeoff, and then he felt it slam down. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, my God.  And then a sharp turn, and then airborne again when they went off a little ravine type thing.  Oh, my God.  And then a big, like, he said he felt the bottom drop out.  Like, all of a sudden, you feel like you're going down a big hill in a car.  You get that whoop feeling.  And then a big slam into the seat.  And then they slid to a stop.  He looked.  The door was open.  And he was out.  Wow.  Did everybody go out the side, the emergency doors?  The emergency doors.  Oh, every door was being used. 
[02:00:30]  They put the slides out so people were sliding down.  Yeah, which is odd that most injuries, when people aren't injured really seriously in the crash, obviously, are from the emergency slides.  Yeah.  Breaking ankles.  Oh, right.  Breaking arms.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  And nobody died.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  I would have died, because I never wear my belt, you know, because I think it's cool when you take off and you're like, yeah.  What did you know?  I need this.  I know.  How am I supposed to jump up when the plane hits the ground and live?  Hey, I wonder if you're the first guy in line for the can after the headphone sale. 
[02:01:00]  Headphone sale.  Have you ever used your headphone to rappel down?  The Giver.  We're going to wrap up with David Tell next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our last show of the year.  Thank God.  It's been a weird year for the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm going to put this one in the books and start anew.  Yeah, this year can just suck one. 
[02:01:30]  Can't get any worse in 2009.  Well, let's knock wood.  No kidding.  Please.  David Tell is going to be at Caroline's at 26th through the 30th.  Let's not forget that.  Thanks for having me in, guys.  I thought it was a, I'm more of a second to last show guy.  I'm not like a big closer, money shot, you know.  The last show of the year is always, you just want to get out of here.  Thanks.  We didn't want to work today.  Yeah.  We really wanted to just, you know, not show up or phone it in. 
[02:02:00]  But I don't know.  I'm being really funny today.  Yeah, you're good.  Yeah, you decided to work today, which is nice.  It's a treat for everybody when you decide you want to do the show.  I really thought I was just going to phone it in.  But I will tell you at 930 when the market opens, you're probably going to lose me for a little bit.  Why?  What are you buying this late in the year?  You know something?  I've been toying with General Motors and Ford. 
[02:02:30]  Wow.  I've been buying and selling.  Having a little fun with that.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  They took a nice little crap yesterday.  So we'll see how it looks early on a little bit.  I might toy with buying a few and then offing them a little later on.  Hold on a minute.  Is this coming from you or from an Asian market or something?  Oh, yeah.  Were you on the phone early, early, talking to your man in Bing Bang?  At the Bing Bang Exchange in Chung Wang. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, it was.  The guy on the ground in the, hey.  Yeah, my guy in the trenches.  I love inside the training because it's always the most boring thing.  It's like, my friend who I used to play at Exeter with something, he said his dentist hit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, enough.  Yeah.  But, no, I've been toying with those.  Make a couple of bucks here and there.  That's very optimistic.  When the country's in trouble and companies are going under, you've got to try to make as much money with their demise as you can. 
[02:03:30]  That's wonderful.  That's capitalism.  It sure is.  Yes.  Capitalism alive and well.  Bask in the failure of the free market.  We've got a couple of weird stories, just some quickies here.  And you can comment as we go.  George Lucas signs off on Star Wars, A Musical Journey, debuting next year in London. 
[02:04:00]  Hold on.  Just tell me that isn't true and that's a joke.  At least he's not milking it.  I'll bring my mug and my other figurines.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's doing Star Wars, the musical now.  A Musical Journey.  No.  I guess if you're going to have one idea, or in his case, two or three, if you're going to have three ideas, one of them should be Star Wars.  Because he's been riding that.  If you're going to have one idea, it might as well be Star Wars.  Was it 77?  The guy's been milking it even before that. 
[02:04:30]  When you figure when he first started and got the ideas and started writing it.  Wow.  I mean, dude, the 70s.  Yeah.  Let it go.  Why can't he do the same thing for cars that he's done for, what was, sci-fi, fantasy, something.  What he does.  I don't know.  What he does.  Right.  Okay.  And what he does.  And he CGI some cars that work and don't use gas.  I bet you don't make it kid friendly, like the kids, the characters on the stage are fighting cuddly and little. 
[02:05:00]  A lot of Ewoks.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's going to be probably Wookiees.  Choreography.  Wookiee dancing.  Star Wars choreography.  Jar Jar Binks.  Wasn't that their misstep movie, though?  The one with the Wookiees at the end where they were all dancing around?  The Wookiees.  Horrible.  With the Ewoks all dancing.  Ewoks.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that was the last one.  And then Darth Vader with his helmet off and all the rest of them up there smiling down.  He's a douche.  George Lucas is a douche. 
[02:05:30]  So what is this musical?  I don't know.  Any more info on it?  I just read the headline and that was good enough for me.  I didn't need to read further on that one.  Because I'm not feeling it.  No.  Do you think he had to convince, like, the powers that be?  Like, I want to do a musical on Star Wars and the people are like, well, I don't know.  Oh, Star Wars.  Okay.  Because, like, I mean, anything, Star Wars anything.  I mean, I'd have a Star Wars coffin.  I mean, that would sell. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Not content with seven feature films or a myriad of TV spinoffs ranging from the current Clone Wars cartoon series to the dreaded Star Wars holiday special.  Love that one.  But the Jedi masterminds are readying for a stage show.  George Lucas signed off.  Star Wars musical journey.  A two-hour live musical event featuring a Stormtrooper kick line.  Wow.  And singing Wookiees, John Williams' Oscar-winning score also. 
[02:06:30]  Stormtrooper kick line.  They should line Lucas up in front of that and have him bend over.  Premiering next year in London's O2 Arena.  The production will be performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in sync with the movie clips from the six live-action films.  The show will play in chronological order from The Phantom Menace to Return of the Jedi.  The production will blast off April 10th in the UK and embark on a European tour complete with an exhibition of rare Star Wars collectibles, 
[02:07:00]  including never-before-seen models, props, costumes, production artwork.  No word when it will visit America to rave reviews, I'm sure.  Oh, that's a 200-something-a-ticket.  Oh, you've got to know it.  Yeah, that's a big...  He should just go for half a billion-a-ticket and hope to just sell to one geek, one rich geek, that will just sit there by himself.  And just make his actors perform to empty houses until the one guy finally shows up. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, because I am just, my prediction, epic fail.  Yeah.  Not if they get, who was the original Luke guy?  Oh, Mark Hamill?  That'll be it.  Mark Hamill dancing.  What else is he doing?  He'll probably make some kind of appearance.  Singing show tunes.  Really fast.  Two more things.  You know, we're all trying to live as one in this world, but it's good to know this is still going on somewhere.  Indian villagers shave and beat 50 women accused of witchcraft.  Well, what were they doing? 
[02:08:00]  I don't know.  Were they casting spells?  Were they witchcraft driving, uttering opinions?  I decided not to read today, but now that you ask, I don't know.  I don't know.  An Indian village.  No.  Now, are you talking Indian from India or India Native American?  Indian, excuse me.  7-Eleven, India.  Less village, more casino parking lot situation.  So, okay, you're talking India.  Well, a spiritual man from the village said that this would protect them from evil spirits. 
[02:08:30]  All right.  You know, he's trying to do the right thing for the village.  That's the problem.  Yeah.  You must go to Pankot Palace.  Come on.  Well, there...  Thank you, Danny.  Was it...  What movie, Andy?  You lost me on that one.  Indiana Jones, Temple of Doom.  Oh, okay.  Kalima!  Kalima!  Up your heart, Indy.  See, that's the kind of parts I could do, because I'm a horrible liar, but I could definitely 
[02:09:00]  do...  I could do that.  You know, just pretend something amazing.  Yeah.  I could do that.  Kalima!  I'll see you in hell!  Come on.  Fantastic.  So, what...  You know, Grady was in that movie, by the way.  Was he?  Was he?  Yeah.  Wonderful.  For a split second, he's one of the guys that come up and start a shooting across the  ravine at the guys that are shooting the arrows at Indy. 
[02:09:30]  Is that real?  Yeah.  No kidding.  Grady.  Yeah, it's Mr. Grady.  Two more things about the witchcraft.  Well, there are a few killings in...  Wow.  It's worth spelling for the people out there.  C-H-H-A-T-T-I-S-G-A-R.  Hanukkah.  Hanukkah, Louisiana?  More than 100 women are tortured, paraded naked, or harassed in the state annually. 
[02:10:00]  Where is this?  In this town in India that I can't pronounce, yes.  Or village.  Oh, no way.  Is it Prouchoir Private?  How did they get mail there?  And it's such a problem, the state passed a Witchcraft Prevention Act in 2005.  Yeah, PSAs, I saw them.  They just wrote it on a giant turtle.  Sent it out.  Spread the word.  God, people just, you think it's 2008. 
[02:10:30]  You know, it's so funny how we started with David Blaine and we're ending with David Blaine.  If he can go over there and do some of his, you know, ta-da-isms in front of them, I think  that would really, yeah, they'd be like, I'm there.  Wizard!  You know, and then he'd take their jackets.  And I want to acknowledge all the fresh faces coming in to get free food today.  Yeah.  Good luck to you guys.  This is like that nom analogy from time to time.  Look at them all happy.  Hey, guys, what can I do to help the effort? 
[02:11:00]  It is very cool, you know.  Some employees are here.  All young and fresh.  We haven't seen them yet.  All fresh faces.  Right off the C-130.  Yeah.  And, uh...  You guys met Lisa Orban, right?  Yeah.  If you realize she's only 22 years old.  Oh, God.  That's what this place will do to you.  Yeah.  Rip it to pieces.  Oh, look at them all.  Look at them.  I haven't seen smiles in a long time around here.  Yeah.  The fresh faces here to brighten everyone's day.  Stay with me, Gardner. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  How cool was that movie?  Oh, fantastic.  Barnes.  Well, let's get out of here.  Can't kill Barnes.  We got to start the...  Shot seven times.  We got to start the rock and roll.  We got to get out of here.  Yeah.  This is the place where rock lives, Dave.  I don't know if you know it.  Guys, I'm telling you, thanks for having me.  No problem.  Jim, I hope you feel better, buddy.  What are you going to do?  Thank you.  I'm sure I'll be okay.  You sure?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your eyes are almost open at this point.  I don't get sick very often. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I'm a healthy boy.  David Tell, Caroline's, 26th through the 30th.  Jimmy, where are you going to be?  You got the third show at the Borgata?  Yeah, but the important one was New Year's Eve at Crocodile Rock in Allentown.  That's the big one.  That's going to be a wild show.  Oh, disaster.  And then Martin Luther King weekend, I got three shows at the Borgata.  Friday, Saturday, I think are sold out.  Sunday is now available.  Remember, no fireworks inside.  Right.  Allentown's like one of those, yeah, they do it good.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  Sorry.  Unless the company has one final trick up their sleeves, we'll hopefully see you in 2009.  Yeah.  I do remember I was taking my honeymoon, assuming that we would be continuing in major markets  and came back to find out that was not the case.  Well, it happens.  So hopefully we'll see you in 2009.  Yes.  If not, we'll pop up somewhere.  Godspeed.  What do you want from us?  Happy holidays.  Don't go after yourselves.  The Opie and Anthony show continues with a nice live audience, by the way. 
[02:13:00]  I want to acknowledge that right off the bat.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  It was nice to see a lot of faces when we walked through today.  A lot of familiar.  Some I've never seen before.  Yeah.  One lucky woman will be kissing Lily today.  That's right.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  The kiss Lily bit continues.  If she's even here.  It's sad that this is going to go away soon.  The bleacher thing.  Yeah.  They can't figure this out in the new joint over there at the Sirius building. 
[02:13:30]  They can't figure it out.  How to get a live audience in there for us.  I don't think they think it's that important to the show.  No, no, it doesn't add a nice, fun dynamic to the program to have a live crowd to play off of.  No, because they've never really seen it before on radio.  They're confused by it.  Yeah, everything we do is very confusing to them.  They're confused by the fact that our fans actually go out of their way to come see the show live,  and we have no problem letting them check out the nonsense. 
[02:14:00]  That's cool.  We could probably bring one person up at a time.  So we'll have one person come up there to just stare at us.  Yeah.  They think it's fine, though.  So we'll...  Do you get it?  Hold on.  They might think we're really getting on them over here.  Understand it's part of radio, what we're doing right now, so don't freak out.  Yeah, we're kind of just making fun of the fact that you guys are putting us in a very tiny studio.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:14:30]  When we have all this.  The foster kids again.  We get to leave this to go into a tiny little box.  Again, we are the children who have a great life, great parents.  The parents perished.  They put us in a foster home where we are now beaten.  Yeah.  Kept in a much smaller bedroom.  Yeah.  Not loved as much as the real children.  As their real kid gets the master bedroom.  Oh, yeah.  Huge suite.  They're redoing the basement for us, though.  That's good.  Yeah.  With the black mold, the mice, the flooding.  Dear Santa, please make my new parents stop beating me. 
[02:15:00]  What I want for Christmas.  Right.  Number one, love.  What happened?  We were so loved.  We haven't been yelled at in years.  I've been yelled at more in the last, I don't know, two months than I have in years.  And every meeting we've had has ended in yelling. 
[02:15:30]  Like, it's not like, like we can't even.  What happened?  It ends as, you're not my dad.  You're not my real dad.  Yeah, but he died.  So this is all you get.  It's all you got.  So deal with it.  Foster children.  Great.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  Well, this isn't too much for anybody.  Hey, can you take it over there?  Oh, look out.  We'll wait and see.  David Tell made the walk over.  Thanks for having me, guys. 
[02:16:00]  I was chain smoking outside slowly freezing to death.  I walked by, I go, now that's some dedication.  Now, if people had dedication in their careers or at their job, like they have dedication trying  to figure out how to smoke when it's like zero degrees out.  Yeah.  Can you imagine how successful you would really be?  Yeah.  You really got to give it to the smokers that are out there smoking on days like this  because they aren't pussing out.  There are some smokers, they don't even smoke. 
[02:16:30]  They don't even smoke, those bastards.  It's too cold for them.  Right.  Yeah.  Not Dave.  No.  They're out there puffing.  It's my ultimate addiction, and I would not do it for my second one, porn.  Like if I had to leave the house and do it on the street and then walk back in, that  would be very awkward.  Yes, it would.  Yeah, when you do the same thing to search out your porn.  Where are we?  Who wants to shake hands?  We are not allowing porn in the building anymore.  You can view porn out back by the door, and then you're just there with your porn buddies 
[02:17:00]  every morning.  Hey, how you doing?  I want to get that porn smell in my curtains and hair.  I've broken promises, and may I say, geez, oh.  Horrible secondhand porn when you're walking by.  Yeah.  Bunch of guys jerking off and they're going to door jam because it's raining.  Just working your shaft in front of others.  I gave up porn a year ago, and I have to be exposed to a pussy on a screen like that?  Right.  Fuck you. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, that's good.  That's a good image.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Greg in Philly.  Greg?  Greg?  Yo.  Greg, you want a blowjob, Greg?  Oh.  Oh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  Hey, your story reminds me of Flowers in the Attic.  I think little Jimmy's wanting the cookies.  Oh, Flowers in the Attic.  Do you know Flowers in the Attic, eh?  I know that reference.  Was that an after-school special?  Horror movie.  That was a movie.  Horror movie?  It was kind of hot.  Didn't the brother and sister fuck each other or something?  George C. Scott, right?  Anyone?  Anyone?  I don't know Flowers in the Attic.  We'll get a synopsis up immediately. 
[02:18:00]  They don't grow in the attic, though, probably.  There's no sunlight.  What was the big thing with Flowers in the Attic?  They're literally about Flowers in the Attic, Jimmy.  Oh, I thought it was a gardening show.  I thought it was a gay code.  Oh, literal Anthony calling out literal Jim.  Greg in Philly, what's up?  So, what's this Flowers in the Attic all about?  All right.  Well, the mom and dad took off, and the dad died.  Well, the mom went home to be back with her parents, and she wasn't supposed to have these kids,  so they get stuck in the attic, and they were locked in there, and they started feeding them poison. 
[02:18:30]  Why'd they feed them poison?  To get rid of the kids so the mom could get remarried.  Now, come on.  Brother and sister fucking, right?  Uh, there was in your windows, but I'm not really sure of the diners.  Oh, ass fucking.  Ha, ha, ha.  Get it in your endo.  What?  Yeah.  Boo-hoo.  We don't like your analogy.  Let's go to Jeremy in Jersey.  Boo-boo-boo-boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[02:19:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  B-b-b-bo-bo-bo-boo-boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Jeremy, go ahead.  Good morning, boys.  Yeah.  Opie, your analogy is a little mistaken.  It's more like you're living with your parents' murderers.  Wow, this guy does throw an interesting twist into it.  Well, we threw the whole car crash scenario where we lost our parents in a car crash,  but I guess we're now living with the people that caused the car crash.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah, they've taken us in as foster children.  Because they feel guilty that they caused the death of your parents.  But we're a constant reminder of it. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  So they have to beat us.  Yeah, well, you're next.  Can we maybe have Steve write the bosses?  I want to make sure we're not going too far with this.  Yeah, please.  Lord knows we don't need any more conference calls.  All right, Merry Christmas, shit dicks.  All right.  Thanks a lot, sir.  Fuck's dick.  That's so aggressive.  Yeah, no, just slightly.  Nice fresh talk.  Hey, we got a Merry Christmas coming in from San Francisco.  Pete.  Hey, you faggot.  Hey, man.  That's not nice.  I just called to wish you guys a Merry Christmas.  Oh, he is gay.  Come on, guys. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yeah, sure.  Are you guys ever going to do anything out here in California, like San Francisco?  I am doing comedy out there in March.  You know, I saw you last time you were here.  I don't care.  Sex with men.  Yeah, you know what you guys would be great at?  The Folsom Street Fair.  Have you guys ever heard of that out there?  Yes, they haven't.  It's a public display of flogging.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  It's about the BDSM thing, right?  Yeah, it's the big leather festival.  BDSM.  Yeah, bonded disciplines say there's a masochism.  Of course. 
[02:20:30]  Of course.  You guys are awesome, man.  I really appreciate you guys in the morning.  I wouldn't mind going in and getting a little spanking.  You ever get a spanking on Folsom Street?  I don't personally, but, you know, I'm sure there's a bunch of websites that you could go to.  Yeah.  It's a Friday night in Tehran.  You know, you do the old tuck and roll with your thumb and forefinger, right?  What do you mean?  Well, you know.  Actually, I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you mean?  When you're spanking or getting a spanking?  Yeah, you just spank it, and then right before you're about ready to blow a load, you just  do a little thumb and forefinger roll.  I'm starting to get...  Right on the tip of your dick.  I'm starting to get the feeling that the gay community is... 
[02:21:00]  Oh, the teapot.  ...is welcoming us.  Is embracing us.  Yeah, they're warming up to the humor that is Opie and Anthony.  No surprise with all the gay shit we've been doing lately.  Yeah.  Dude, hey, last week, that shit was gay.  And he said...  From fucking Frisco.  Yeah, a gay guy from San Francisco.  We're being called gay.  A gay guy from San Francisco.  And that's where he's called a gay.  I'm not gay.  Right.  I thought you said yes when we asked that question.  You suck one dick.  Yeah, all right.  What is it?  Who cares?  Have a Merry Christmas.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  Thank you, Pete.  Being invited to a street fair.  Hey, thanks a lot, plug boy.  Whoa.  Hey, they're follicles.  Denison, Putnam Valley.  You homo.  He's going to back you up with your theory about the flowers in the attic.  Dennis?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Merry Christmas.  Hey, man.  In the book, they had sex.  And they insinuated the movie.  That's all.  Okay.  See?  So the book was a lot sexier.  What year is it?  Yeah, the book was a lot sexier.  What year is it?  The movie or the book?  The both.  The 70s?  Oh, the 70s.  Okay.  I'm not sure when the book was published, but the movie was 87. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, 87?  All right.  It's a good book.  It's a good movie.  Wow.  Yeah.  I love you, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  Get in line.  All right.  David L. is going to be at Caroline's.  You want to bring in Lily?  The last kiss Lily bit of the year?  Oh, what is this bitch going to do?  Is that it?  What is this bitch going to do?  Come on in here, Lily.  Here's Lily.  She's really hot.  She's a Ron and Fez reject.  We pick up all the Ron and Fez rejects. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Washed up.  The land of misfit fucking intern, whatever they are and aren't.  Why are you washed up as far as Ron and Fez go?  What happened?  Something happened with a party one night.  Right.  What?  I didn't hear about this.  And me being underage and being in a bar.  Oh, really?  Something about that.  What a sexy voice.  Yeah, but if you don't work for the company, who gives a crap if you were able to get into  a bar underage?  It happens all the time.  Sure.  Well, how old are you?  Sure. 
[02:23:00]  I'm 20.  Really?  I'm nine months away from being 21.  It's ridiculous.  No, but because you're Asian, it's so hard to tell how old you are.  Yeah.  You could be eight or a hundred maybe.  I mean, you have, you know, you're eternal, you know?  You saying you're nine months away from being 21 is a long time.  It's not like I'm going to be 21 next week.  You want to be nine months away from having your first kid? 
[02:23:30]  Thank you.  See, that's, let's have sex now.  Joke.  You're 20.  Yeah.  So, Flowers in the Attic, that must be some hippie band that you know from Bonnaroo or whatever.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  So, you want to kiss a girl today or what?  Sure.  Anybody, any takers out there?  It's our kiss Lily bit.  And the guys will be all like, yeah, me.  They're all pointing at the brunette in the back row. 
[02:24:00]  One, one check.  There's a girl.  I can't see her.  Is she volunteering?  No.  I don't see anybody volunteering.  Does she have that girl hand up?  Well, Lily, why don't you look at the crowd and see who you would be willing to kiss out there?  Well, there are three ladies out there.  Are there?  Wow.  Yeah.  Usually, it's all guys.  So, this is a good sign.  Yeah, it's like a pussy fist.  One's taking a nap on her boyfriend's shoulder.  No, she went into that position as soon as we started talking to you. 
[02:24:30]  She's shy.  She's trying to show everyone that she has no desire to do this.  Yeah.  Her body language says it all.  There's a very pretty blonde girl.  You like the blonde?  I'm going to point her out because I know everyone's thinking it.  Yeah.  In the middle.  I don't see the bitch.  She's also with a guy who's way below her pay grade.  Wow.  You say he's dead out of his league?  Yes.  I would say so.  Well, what does he do for a living?  No fun.  What do you do for a living that you got the hot blonde?  Pilot.  Corporate pilot.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:25:00]  Corporate pilot.  Dude, come on.  The pilot, for fuck's sake.  That's right.  Of course.  Weekend trip to Vegas beats, you know, double chin or something.  What do you fly, my friend?  It's Gulfstream G150.  Oh, shit, my hat.  When are we going for a ride, my friend?  Whatever you want.  Fly boy.  For real?  Well, no, not for real.  What if we paid your...  Well, who have you flown?  Yeah.  What's that?  Who do you fly?  Fly for Chevron.  You oil... 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, man.  Did you fly to D.C. with their hat in their hand, trying to get a bailout?  Yeah, man.  That's pretty cool.  Chevron.  Yep.  So, what do you fly for that?  Sheiks?  You fly Sheiks into, like, you know...  What do you?  You better be left seat with her.  Yeah?  Okay.  What's that in?  What do you fly, a bunch of fat cats?  I'm going to be a fucking co-pilot. 
[02:26:00]  Fly a bunch of fat cats?  Yeah, that's right.  Fat cats.  Regular Joes.  What do you think happened with that plane that was going to Houston?  I don't know.  Well...  Good answer.  August fell down.  Yeah, I know, right?  I didn't hear much info on it all besides...  Yeah, why would you?  You're a pilot.  You're a pilot.  Why would you be in touch with what's going on out there?  Nobody knows anything yet.  What's the most harrowing situation you've ever been in in the air?  Probably had to do with icing.  Well, this was back when I was a flight instructor. 
[02:26:30]  I was in a small plane flying back from Chattanooga.  Chattanooga!  That's right.  Chattanooga.  And, uh...  Were you flying Billy Ray Cyrus down there for...  Did he give you a surprise reach-around while you were hitting altitude?  What were we in?  Ron White in the fucking plane.  172 or 152?  Neither was actually a Piper.  Oh, Piper.  Yeah, I know you're pretty up on the airplanes.  I love them.  Yeah.  I love them.  A Piper.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Yeah, but those Cessnas, like, are children's toys.  Yeah, they really are. 
[02:27:00]  Anything else on a jet sucks, so...  But, uh, so you're iced up in a Piper?  Yep.  That's right.  Oh, wow.  Dude.  And I was only about 3,000 feet with the ground about 1,000 feet below me.  Oh, shit.  Is that bad air?  Is that bad?  As opposed to good?  That's not a good...  It doesn't give him much room to get the fucking ice to get off before, you know, before he stalled.  Can you shake the wings a little bit?  No, I think you've got to kind of either, uh, if you...  Did the plane have heater for a...  Well, it didn't work. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, okay.  That's good.  And it's even worse when ATC's coming on the radio and telling you you have, like, a low altitude alert.  Oh, great.  And to climb immediately.  There you go.  Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ground, ground, ground.  Yeah, it was something like that.  Terrain, terrain.  These are all things you never want to hear.  Does that make you panic even more, though?  You're aware of the situation, right?  Just throw your hands up and scream.  No, so, uh, yeah, it doesn't leave you much room for, uh, to de-ice. 
[02:28:00]  No, not at all.  I mean, I was sort of at the bottom of a cloud layer, and at the time I heard that, I was  looking outside, looking for trees, because I really thought I was going down.  Oh, my God.  That was probably my closest near-death experience.  How'd you get out of it?  No parachute, too, right?  But as soon as they told me that, I gave it full power and started climbing, and as  soon as I got out of the clouds, all the ice blew off.  Were you ever able to go out and, like, scrape it off the wing?  What the fuck?  Is he a wing walker?  Yeah.  I put it on autopilot and just sort of walked out there.  Get out there with a scraper. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, actually, I grabbed the gremlin that was on the, uh, the tri-light zone.  The man on the wing, he's scraping the ice.  I stuck him out there to scrape the ice off.  Wow.  Well, that's pretty fucked up.  Yeah, it was fucked up.  You start, did you get the shutter, like, uh-oh, I'm stalling?  Did the plane start shaking a little bit?  As I started climbing, I started to get it, but if you start getting that, you'd get  a little over the nose.  Did you have to dump the coke?  Jesus.  Nice.  Write this one off on the cartel.  Fuck, man.  On the cartel.  Well, hey, uh, why aren't you, uh, afraid of flying? 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  I've never been.  I actually, I've always wanted.  You've never been afraid?  I've always wanted to do it.  God bless you.  Ever since I was, like, five years old.  And he's the guy at the controls, so, you know, he's the guy that, it's not you sitting  in the back while they shut the fucking door.  Well, I want to ask this question.  Why, why should we not be afraid of flying?  Because there's a lot of, uh, people that hate it.  Statistics.  Just go with the stats?  Yeah, I mean, they say that you're more likely to get into a wreck in a car than you are on 
[02:29:30]  a plane, so.  Right.  I mean.  Yeah, but the cars make the airbags now.  You know how they gotta pick up your body parts from fucking an 800-yard stretch when  you have that car wreck?  Yeah, but at least it's it, right?  Hey, mister.  You know how you see a car wreck coming from a minute away when you're plummeting?  Oh, shit, I'm gonna crash my car.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, shit, let me write a letter to my loved ones.  There's not that terror in your fucking...  Eh, whatever. 
[02:30:00]  Do you get nervous when you hit turbulence?  No.  No?  I don't.  Even when it's bad?  No, because...  No?  It makes fun.  I don't even get scared of that data anymore.  The bump thing is easy for me now.  I stand up and scream, we're gonna die, the devil has got us.  That makes it fun.  I talk to a lot of people that like the terror.  Lynch.  Yeah, they like the little bumps.  We got another question coming in. 
[02:30:30]  I want to say this, right?  How do pilots stay so calm in fucked up situations like the one you were in there?  This is Dan from Washington asking that.  Training.  Just straight training.  I mean, you practice that stuff and you do so much studying that you know what to do  in the situation.  I guess you could either scream and freak out.  That's right.  Or you're so busy trying to just recover from the situation that you don't have time to  think about it until it's over.  Wow.  Yeah, pretty much.  Like, you just...  Your training takes over and you do what you have to do and pray to God. 
[02:31:00]  Well, you can't pray to God because God doesn't have anything to do with it.  Yeah, pray to God.  No kidding.  If God is there, his hand would just...  Like, you could land on his hand and he'll place you down gently.  Do you eat at the airport or do you brown bag it?  You got a spiffy uniform and shit?  What's that?  You got a spiffy uniform and everything?  Oh, no.  We don't.  What, you're just flying the fucking regular clothes?  Uniforms are for airline...  Douches.  Fagot pilots. 
[02:31:30]  You're an airline faggot pilot.  Are you part of the Mile High club there?  As a matter of fact, I am.  Wow, look at that.  With the blonde next to you?  Awkward.  Awkward.  Back when I was a flight instructor.  What?  Back when I was a flight instructor.  Awkward.  That's great.  She's whispering, you're going to tell me about that after the show.  I already told her.  How fucking excited does she get watching you fly that goddamn thing? 
[02:32:00]  Jesus Christ.  Not much anymore because I met her.  She was a flight attendant for the airline I worked for.  Oh, shit.  What airline?  Oh, shit.  What airline can you say?  Eastern.  AirTran.  Huh?  American Eagle.  American Eagle.  So she saw, you know, she saw a real pilot.  That's not even the trailways of the airlines.  American Eagle.  Is he the first pilot you dated?  What?  What, Lily?  Is he the first pilot that you dated?  Yeah.  Have you ever dated a ship captain and a locomotive guy?  An engineer?  A locomotive guy.  I love it. 
[02:32:30]  I don't know.  That's great.  It's very cool.  It's like every form of train.  You know, rickshaw guy.  That was a weird weekend.  We got to, you know, I thought we were done with you, but Stephen S. from Bayshore has  a really good question.  Yeah.  Can the pilots somehow release the contents of the shit-holding tanks when flying over  a heavily populated area just to be a silly goose?  Do you let that shit fly just to be silly?  I've done a lot of research on that just to drop shit over people's houses that I don't  like, but unfortunately you can't.  Yeah.  It's probably against FAA rules, too. 
[02:33:00]  But how would they know?  There has been instances where there's been a buildup because of a leak or something, and  big chunks of that shit called blue ice.  Blue ice.  Knock off and fall through people's roofs.  That's got to be the shit when you're just fucking sitting there in your house and a big  thing of shit comes through your roof.  You're killed by plane duty.  Lucky you.  It could have been the same odds as fucking winning lotto, but for you, it's blue ice.  Frozen shit with a bunch of fucking commuters.  Yeah, taking nasty fucking wet ones. 
[02:33:30]  Bad eating.  Are we playing Kiss Lily today or what?  What do you think, Lil?  I'm one of these broads.  Do that one, Lily.  She's so hot, yeah.  I want to do her, yeah.  You want to do her?  Are we going to go with the pussy, what is it called, Jimmy?  Pussy cup.  Yeah, the pussy cup?  You should, yeah.  Dave, you want a pussy cup today?  What is it?  Would you let Dave Attell, the great Dave Attell, who's going to be at Caroline's, do  a pussy cup today?  Do I have to hold a limbo stick?  What is it?  What is it? 
[02:34:00]  Oh, boy.  Jim, do you want to explain?  It's when you take your hand and you cup the pussy.  You just gently, as a girl lays down, you just gently cup her pussy.  Yeah.  Would you like to cup Lily's pussy?  Well, yeah, but, I mean, I'm no pilot.  I mean, do you want to do that?  For the show, why not?  Yeah.  Make it as impersonal as possible.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be cupping the pussy in about 35 minutes.  See you on the ground.  Dave, would you?  All right, Dave, get up. 
[02:34:30]  You get to cup the pussy today.  Well, what do I?  Do you wear your pants or something?  I hear a rap song when I say cup the pussy.  Do you wear your pants, Lily, or what do you do?  You get naked?  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  I'm wearing leggings again today.  Oh, leggings.  Yeah, well, it's a very Renaissance fair.  Sure.  Let me get out my...  Can he...  Can he winch?  Can he bury...  Oh, yeah, that would be the insertion thing.  See, God forbid we ask if we could bury a knuckle into Lily.  No, well, that's...  You're only like 15, right?  With her clothes on, right?  Insertion.  Is it insertion for clothes or something?  I think I'm going to...  I think I'll just... 
[02:35:00]  Can I warm my hands by your...  You know, kind of like it's guys working on the street, like steam coming out?  Sure.  What up?  Yeah.  You're up for anything.  I love you.  Fiery 55-gallon drum.  Whatever, freak.  It's your money.  How many times have you heard that?  Cup the pussy.  Let's play cup the pussy with Lily.  We need some kind of official sweeper for cup the pussy.  I think like one of these, one of these, like the guy wearing the Celtic shirt or something 
[02:35:30]  like that, a hero.  That's hip-hop wrong.  Who gets his eyebrows done?  He does.  He gets his eyebrows done like a bitch.  She has a very cup-able veg.  Yeah.  I gave it a good cuppin'.  Dave, you're out?  Yeah.  Dave, you're out.  I don't know.  I feel it's like inappropriate or something.  You're not playing cup the pussy today?  Well, I'll do it, yeah.  Lily, do you get permission?  I figured one of the fans or something.  She doesn't work for anybody, so are you uncomfortable with that?  You're a free agent?  She's a free agent.  I'm a free agent.  Yeah, you can, I'm comfortable with it.  I'm filling up. 
[02:36:00]  Are you?  Yeah.  You're cuckled.  You're cupping cuckled.  Yeah.  All right, Dave.  Is that what you call it?  Dave, it's really up to you.  Well, what are you supposed to do?  Just hold it?  Yeah, like a...  Don't look for any reasoning.  Oh, squeeze it like a burger?  Don't look for logic or reason.  Like Danny said, you hold it like you're about to work a sock puppet.  Oh.  Danny has a way of making things sexy.  And Jimmy's filling up, so, you know, we're on to something here.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, good.  You want...  Do I do it now?  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  I don't know if we're playing Kiss Lily today, but we're definitely doing Cup the Pussy.  All right.  Cup, cup, cup the pussy tonight.  Oh, wow, you're really hot.  Huh?  Dave just closes.  Don't you know you got to cup the pussy?  What do you think, Dave?  Should I lift up my skirt?  Tic-tac?  I like a little foreplay.  All right.  David tells me, Cup the Pussy with Lily.  Jimmy?  My leggings have to hold them up a little.  Get a little prayer. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  The big game.  Here?  Jimmy's showing his tent.  Oh, I think I got your mound.  Wait, it's...  You don't have a clit ring.  You should see a doctor.  I think I got your mound.  That is...  That's the worst pussy cup I've ever seen.  I don't know, like, what's the...  Here, show me.  Jimmy, show the proper...  Show the proper pussy cup.  Oh, oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, just like that.  It's very appropriate.  Now I'm second manning the door. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, wow, it's nice and hot.  Yeah.  You know what?  I can read your dreams.  Ooh!  So you want to get on American Idol, but you don't know if it's the right way to go.  Ooh!  Beautiful.  Yeah, there you go.  Thank you, Dave.  That's all it is.  David Teller, oh, yes, yes.  Look at the laws going now.  And now where are we at with Kiss Lily?  I think you're getting a lot of rejects today, Lou.  I know.  I don't think the blonde that's...  Why don't you want to kiss me?  Not blonde. 
[02:38:00]  Um, the audience?  I don't like an audience.  You can stand in the corner like two shame-filled dykes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait.  If they go over here, the audience won't see you, see?  We have an answer for everything on the opening show.  Sounds like I see you from the new Clint Eastwood movie.  I don't know.  Just get off my lawn.  This is the saddest thing.  What a hot girl.  Hot girl.  And another girl won't kiss her?  She has no one to kiss her.  And how come there's no Asian girls on the hills? 
[02:38:30]  I mean, really?  Can't there be like a, you know...  If you know anyone at MTV, I mean, I'd be happy to audition.  Really?  For the role of Elsie's...  Oh, I do, actually.  Really, Jim?  Yeah, the head of MTV production lives in my building.  Really?  Ah, there you go.  Right in your pussy cup, fingerblast to have you.  You sure should.  You might as well go home with Jimmy today.  Yeah, we could have like a real meeting.  All right.  I'll put my business suit on and everything.  And you could wipe his diarrhea ass today. 
[02:39:00]  I know.  I got nothing sexy going on.  Just fucking butterscotch pudding on the back of my thighs.  That's the best he could offer you today.  Yeah.  His diarrhea ass.  It looked like someone just dumped like fucking Sanka into the toilet.  That's the worst.  Lukewarm Sanka.  How about the brunette with the Tory Burch sweater?  Ooh.  Oh, how did...  Well...  Let's talk to her.  Who are you?  Um, Ina.  Ina.  Who are you from?  From where? 
[02:39:30]  Um, Atlanta, Georgia.  Yeah, right.  No.  Real.  Well.  Belarus.  Maybe Soviet Georgia.  You were close.  You were close.  Yeah.  You're a Russian broad.  Would you as a...  Oh, another one.  Could you kiss her in a reenactment of the Cold War?  Yeah.  Of our enemies meeting?  Yeah.  What do you say?  Lily, what are you...  Are you Korean?  I'm Chinese.  You're Chinese.  Red or the other one?  Where are you from?  Hong Kong?  No.  I was born in communist...  I was born a communist. 
[02:40:00]  In Mainland Channel, so...  In Mainland where?  Uh...  You're in the sneaker factory?  No, where the earthquake was, like, a year ago, I think.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry about that.  I sent money for that.  Thank you.  Do you have relatives that work in the sweatshops over there, or what?  Are they making our sneakers?  No.  My...  They're all white-collar workers.  Yeah.  Well, Lily, work the Russian broad.  Let's see what...  Yeah, work her.  What do you got going on?  I almost kissed a Russian girl last week.  Does that help?  That's true.  Do you like girls, or are you just doing it for the...  I do like girls. 
[02:40:30]  I'm a little bi-curious, I have to say.  Really?  Ooh.  Yeah.  I don't know if I call myself bisexual, but...  Bi-curious.  Bi-curious.  I like that.  What does that mean?  Give me a retenting again?  I kissed a girl song.  Like, you're not at the point where, like, you'll kiss a girl, but, like...  Maybe I won't go down on her.  Maybe I won't finger her yet.  Like, doing nitrous and putting on a strap on.  That's not...  You're not there yet.  No.  No, not that stage.  Why wouldn't you eat on...  It's cold out.  Why wouldn't you, like, do a little pussy thing?  Well, it'll be at the, um...  Up to that level, you know? 
[02:41:00]  Right.  Like, there has to be a certain level of genuine intimacy for pussy stuff.  Maury.  You chicks are hysterical with that shit.  Sounds like it's L-word episode.  Two gay guys.  They'd just be sucking each other's cock at how do you do?  Yeah.  How do you do?  How do you do?  Oh, my.  You're walking a small dog.  So am I.  Oh, my.  I've had to go to the Halloween parade for audio for this very program.  Yeah.  And I can't even describe to you the things that I've seen just happening in the streets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, we need some intimacy, and if things work out, it's like, shove your face 
[02:41:30]  in there.  The women get caught up with their emotions.  Yeah.  Just dive in there.  I like your choice.  Hey, Russian broad, come on in here and kiss Lily for us so we can move on.  At least come in.  Let's see the Russian.  Yeah, let's see the Russian.  Huh?  Let's do friendly kiss?  Yeah, friendly kiss.  Let the...  Where are you from, me?  I'm not gonna talk, you.  We'll start with a friendly kiss.  Oh.  It'll be...  It looks like a dude.  Oh.  Hello.  Beautiful.  It's sexy. 
[02:42:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  So now, where are you originally from?  Well, from Ukraine, Kyiv.  Ukraine.  Oh, that's cool.  Sure.  From Ukraine.  That's excellent.  Very near Bel-Russia.  Cool game.  They said serial killers in the Ukraine.  Did you hear that?  Working for INS, you learn a little things about eyebrows and whatnot.  How do you know about our show?  My friend took me here.  Is he a pilot, too?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  No, he's not.  Are you guys having sex?  Oh, good.  Well, that guy looks really Russian.  You call him a friend, but he looks at it a little differently than you. 
[02:42:30]  He looks like he dosed and he's about to play hockey against Leary.  Did he mail order?  No.  Oh, no.  He's Russian, right?  No, he's not.  Oh, where's he from?  Can he come over?  Yeah, he could come over.  Yeah, he's from on over.  How did you meet her?  It's an international story here.  When we get into the hardcore lesbian, he's going to have to beat it.  How do you guys know each other?  We met in Atlanta.  Really?  We live in Atlanta.  Is that what we call the Internet, giving your credit card number out?  No, she makes more money than I do. 
[02:43:00]  Really?  What do you do?  Dance.  Huh?  Of course.  What'd she say?  Engineer.  Engineer.  Drive a train or draw?  Neither.  Well, you know, engine.  Speaking of train.  I was kind of with you there.  The wreck.  I was kind of with you.  Are you boyfriend, girlfriend?  Yeah, she can have a girlfriend.  She's fine.  She can have a girlfriend?  Absolutely.  All right.  Lily?  This would be the ultimate gift.  Let's start with a friendly kiss.  All right.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  This is like...  Have you ever kissed a girl before?  It's going to be friendly.  It's a hot porn.  Oh, she's panicking.  She's like, it's going to be a friendly kiss.  It's going to be a friendly kiss.  This costed $20.  Let's see what a friendly kiss looks like.  All right.  We got Lily and the Russian broad.  Oh, God.  Look at them going, those two communists.  She's like...  They were passing secrets!  Wait, her lips couldn't have been any tighter.  That was so good timing.  We'll do it again.  We want to film this for the Girls in Awful Boots collection. 
[02:44:00]  Do you have some water?  You're the boyfriend.  Get in there.  Come on.  Work it.  Hey, she wants some water.  Yeah, work this, man.  Okay.  Yeah.  Slow it down.  Easy.  Get the girl some water.  They're kind of rough.  You gave her a graduate from MIT kiss.  Give her like a, you know...  You want water?  We understand...  Who wants water?  Dave, help me with this here.  We understand...  You've got to do a little better than that.  We're still in the friend zone, but you've got to do a little better than that.  How about this? 
[02:44:30]  It's a little awkward because you guys are concentrating on each other.  What if I get on a chair and just jerk off on both of you?  In football, we call it a flea flicker.  Distraction.  Do you want to see a show?  Yeah, we want to see a show.  Yeah, a little bit.  Slow work.  Slow work.  Work it.  Yes.  All right, here's...  You've got to tell it before.  Yes.  Stupid America.  Here we go.  Look at the keys.  Now we're talking.  Yes, and that's why they have news in Iran. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, we just left the friendly zone there.  I think Russian broad's kind of liking this a little bit.  She's getting a little...  Look at the smile on her face.  Yeah.  What do you think, Georgia?  What do you guys taste like?  You want more?  Lily, what does she taste like?  I don't know.  Broken promises and a system that didn't work.  An infrastructure built on...  Look, if you do a little better, we'll throw in a pair of blue jeans.  That's the best we can do on...  American blue jeans and toilet paper.  Right, we'll throw in...  That seemed to be the big items.  ...jeeks and toilet paper.  No, the guy's digging it. 
[02:45:30]  I think if we...  The guy could work her, I do believe, to get a little better, because she's smiling.  She didn't expect to like it as much as she has, right?  Lily does a very good job at kissing girls.  Jimmy's tenting, and the boyfriend's now huddling, and...  He's going to...  Uh-oh, wait, there's some...  He's going to F-word her right now.  Oh, look at them.  Oh, they're making out.  That's so nice.  All right, look, he presented...  Yeah.  Oh, look at this, Ant.  Wow, yeah.  Now we got some...  Very nice. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, man, do you have this sex where she, like, you hold her like she's groceries?  Oh, yeah, everything.  Oh, cool.  Groceries, yeah.  That's always the hard one.  That's like, three pumps, like, all right, now I'm hurting myself.  And what are you doing in Atlanta?  I work for Porsche.  Whoa.  If I go to buy a car right now, how much discount can you get from a car?  Zero.  Why?  We never discount.  Even in bad times?  Nope.  What douchebags?  Who are you guys selling to that?  Yeah, we'll give you another month or two.  You'll be discounting.  The good times will come back. 
[02:46:30]  You know this guy?  Yeah, I remember you now.  He came down for a black film show.  Please tell me we don't have a problem with him.  No, no, he's cool.  He let me drive...  He actually let me drive a Cayenne Turbo S.  Really?  Yeah.  What a dummy.  Nice.  That's cool, man.  What a cool job.  Yeah, right on.  Well, you got to keep her there.  You got to, you know, keep her happy.  She might like girls.  Do you like girls now?  I think so.  What do you think of that?  I think girls are very kissable, right?  Yeah.  Oh, right?  Very softless. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  Do you want to see her fart box now?  A little commie kissing there.  What if I say, unless you guys keep making out, I'm going to shave your heads and make you  pick turnips?  Who isn't homesick?  All right, very good.  Can I see some guy and guy action?  Yes.  Opie, please.  Jesus.  No, we're done with the guy and guy.  You know what?  The year 2009 is going to be...  Less. 
[02:47:30]  The year of the hetero.  Yes.  The hetero and the year of the lesbo.  We're done with the gay crap.  Done.  Okay, Mary.  Sorry, Sam, but we're done.  It's okay.  Sorry about that.  I think we should get a couple of really gay men in here making out.  Yes, I agree.  Hardcore.  Does that make you hot, thinking of that?  I don't know.  It's cute.  No, it's not.  Does it get you seeing two guys go out?  It's uncomfortably hot, I would say.  No.  No. 
[02:48:00]  Uncomfortable.  I'm not gay, but my hand that clicks the mouse is.  You ever go on a site, you're like, let's just, you know, see what the whole brouhaha is about.  God damn it.  You know what, Dave?  It's not going to get better than that.  We're going to take a quick break.  David Tells at Caroline's 26th through the 30th, 212-757-4100.  I would imagine those shows are going to sell out.  Come on.  I hope so.  Thanks, guys.  Come on now.  We're going to continue in just a bit. 
[02:48:30]  All right, we're hanging with David Tell.  Last show of the year.  I made it.  This comes in a lot, so let's deal with this.  Dave in Canada, how are you, Dave?  I'm pretty good, I guess.  Yeah.  Anthony, you are such a hypocrite.  You said you were never going to have a hole on your show, man, and you've just given this  to Lily all the fucking benefit of the doubt for being anything that she isn't. 
[02:49:00]  Good.  It just, why am I paying for XM when you're doing this shit, man?  Fucking, it makes me sick, dude.  You know what I said.  You never have a fucking hole.  What did I do?  I don't know.  Why is he yelling at me?  Why did I do?  Calm down, bedwetter.  What did I do?  Why do people not like Lily?  I don't understand.  She has a sexy little voice.  She's Asian.  And she lets strangers touch her pussy.  Yeah, and she plays, who else lets you play cup, cup, cup the pussy? 
[02:49:30]  I, uh, why are you a fan or not?  Why are you yelling at me?  I don't know, I don't know.  Oh.  Are you a fan of Lily or not?  Am I a fan of Lily?  Yeah.  Oh, you know, she's Asian.  She's on the air, she's, you know.  It's, it's painless.  Look, it's an empty seat.  She doesn't spend the whole time on our show.  See, the thing, the point is, a hole on the show is a woman co-host that laughs  and laughs and chuckles and, and goes, oh, guys, and tries to stop the guys.  You know, it keeps the guys in check from not getting too crazy. 
[02:50:00]  That's the fucking hole.  Yeah, Lily lets us play cup, cup the pussy.  Lily's like, yeah, a hole doesn't let you fucking touch the hole.  Right.  Hey, that should have got a laugh.  That's funny.  The hole doesn't let you touch the hole.  Plus, we said we needed female, we needed female presidents to try to get the ladies' perspective.  Yes, the ladies' perspective.  That really works for, for it.  Let's, uh.  Yeah, what a dummy.  Who's it, where was he from?  I don't know.  Oh, Canada.  Yeah, figures.  That's in Canada.  Fucking Canadians.  They're all stoned. 
[02:50:30]  Do they have Christmas in Canada?  Christmas?  I know they have Box Day.  Your Boxing Day or Box Day.  What the fuck is that?  We have Box Day with Lily.  Yeah, Box Day.  Hey, uh, Jamie in Boston, how are you?  I love them, boys.  What do you think?  The Pats are going to do it or what?  Are they going to win the division?  I hope so.  I hope so.  They're doing it with the second-string quarterback.  Hey, I, you know, I, I don't, I, I don't have the stats side by side, but I do believe 
[02:51:00]  that the third-string quarterback up there in Boston had a better year than Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  Let's look that up.  I bet you he has.  And there was so much excitement when the Jets brought, uh, Brett Favre to town.  Certainly was.  And, man, what a bust at the end of the season he's become.  One touchdown in the last four games.  All right, enough with sports.  Jamie, go ahead.  Hi, I just got the XM package deal from Sirius, and I haven't heard you guys since, uh, you  guys were in Boston.  And I just wanted to catch up on, uh, old times, uh, what you guys been up to. 
[02:51:30]  Like, Anthony was married, I, I heard he got to go first, and, uh, what about you guys?  Oh, the first time we were in Boston.  Holy shit.  This guy goes way back.  Now, now, Jamie, this is good.  This is like, this is like taking a call from our, our past.  Yes.  And you get to push into the future.  Now, what...  Well, I could make a reference.  I know.  Please don't.  Um, do you, how long have you been listening?  Well, when you got to Boston, we started...  No, no, I know all that.  We get that.  Like, uh, to the new show. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, um, about, uh, three days now.  Now, are we better now, or were we better at AAF?  Because they argue this point all the time on the message boards.  Loaded question.  Basically, Spencer is much better.  Right, right on.  But, uh, you got Jim Norton, which you didn't have to defend.  Right.  And, uh...  Well, let's, uh, we could summarize.  Ant got divorced.  Been through a few girls since.  One with, uh, breast implants and a leaky ass.  Uh, he got hair plugs recently.  God, she's in Iraq.  And, uh... 
[02:52:30]  Ant's doing a little something on his hair.  I didn't get hair plugs.  That's why I had to go back for that.  I got follicles.  A little hair restoration for Anthony.  A couple of follicles.  Yeah.  I got rid of some...  I got rid of some dead weight that I had, uh, over the years.  And I got married.  There you go.  You're caught up.  And Jimmy's...  Jimmy's still having, uh, people shit on his chest, though.  Oh, I don't go with your chest.  Jimmy wasn't, uh, with us back then.  It's not an AAF, no.  It's a polkis.  It's too bad, because, uh... 
[02:53:00]  You know what, now they have HD radio over there, and, uh...  HD's a failure, my friend.  Everyone knows that.  I think even the HD people know that.  I think they're moving on to just, uh, a little, uh, online action.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he's going to, online, or...  All right, Jamie, welcome aboard.  Good to see you.  Let's go to Keith in the Bronx.  Keith.  Oh, my God.  I just got XM.  I've never been so satisfied with a fucking product.  I'm 17.  I'm in the Bronx.  It's fucking...  It was such...  I called up about a year ago. 
[02:53:30]  You guys offered me a free XM package.  I asked my mom if I can get X to my mom.  Could I get XM?  She says, no.  I don't know if he and Anthony, those two faggots, having sex in the church.  She's right.  Then I got a little confused.  Everything Anthony is...  You didn't have sex, I don't think.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, Keith.  I gotta slow you down, because you bring up a good point.  Our whole sex stunt in the church has turned into Aunt and I had sex in the church.  Yeah, what happened?  Like, you just saying that...  You're not saying that as a joke.  I hear more and more, aren't those the two that had sex in the church? 
[02:54:00]  We didn't have the sex in the church.  Oh.  Right, they have sex in, like, closets.  Yes.  Other places.  Back of cars.  Plenty of other places.  Yeah.  A camper.  Yeah.  Well, what Anthony was saying about Obama in the past couple of months, it's all...  I live in the Bronx.  I'm a white kid.  I'm a teenager.  I go to a black high school.  So, I've seen it, too.  I mean, they think everything's gonna change, that the fucking NBA's gonna replace NASCAR  and shit like that.  Like, everything's gonna fucking turn upside down. 
[02:54:30]  But, you know what?  You guys are fucking great.  I've never been satisfied with a product.  Wow.  I want to get into radio now, because I'm 17.  But, uh...  I know it's a tough business, but I just want to thank you guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  I like it because I go to a black high school.  I appreciate it, man.  Yeah.  He goes to a black high school.  In the Bronx.  Okay.  Hey, uh, thanks for this.  How did you earn their respect through, like, a stomp-the-yard moment?  Yeah.  How did he stop an a-yard?  He liked what we said about Obama, I think.  Yeah.  He was saying something about Obama.  Really fast.  Matt Castle and Brett Favre got the stats. 
[02:55:00]  I was right.  They both have 21 touchdowns for the season.  Castle has 11 interceptions.  Brett has 19.  And Matt Castle has 3,600 yards to Brett's 3,200.  So, technically, Matt Castle has had a better year than the star quarterback that the Jets picked up.  Yeah.  There you go.  How about that?  There you go.  A little something weird happened.  We ended our regular radio show today. 
[02:55:30]  Uh-huh.  And the satellite people did not hear what they did right after we said goodbye for the year.  Oh, I noticed this.  I brought it up.  Well, EROC got it taped, and this is really what happened at the end of the show.  When we say goodbye, of course, XM or Sirius or SiriusXM takes it over on regular radio.  They do what they're going to do next, and this is what they did.  So, hopefully, we'll see you in 2009.  Yes.  If not, we'll pop up somewhere.  Godspeed.  What do you want from us?  Happy holidays.  Go wep yourselves. 
[02:56:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  With Opie and Anthony in the morning.  And now, at least 92 minutes of nonstop rock to start your work day.  92 minutes nonstop rock.  Starting now on the rock of New York.  92.3 K-Rock.  K-Rock.  Yeah.  When this happened, I was like, well, that's a little ominous. 
[02:56:30]  We're not getting a reaction from the crowd.  That is, another one bites the dust.  Another one bites the dust.  Speculate, speculate, speculate.  The reference was to the lifestyle of Freddie Mercury.  Nothing to do with the song.  You know, because he's...  Dead?  Yeah, kind of like that fucking awful joke.  Like, I should be.  Yeah.  I should have just stayed home today.  Took your time, huh?  I have nothing.  You dug in, I like that.  I dug in, I swung so hard, and a bat flew out of my hands. 
[02:57:00]  Fucking awful.  Sorry to the audience.  Yeah, that was a little odd, but, you know, that's the music they play now.  Sure.  So what the fuck?  Could have been anything.  Yeah, we'll see.  Could have been I Drink Alone.  Those fresh faces.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that was sad.  That was sad.  Oh, boy.  The fresh young recruits coming off the fucking plane, not knowing what they're going to see.  Oh, my God.  You feel like going up and taking things out of their pack that they're not going to need.  Right.  Leave this here. 
[02:57:30]  Leave this here.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  We are also playing What Did You Learn for the Year on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rob, we continue with you.  Hey.  I called earlier this morning saying Anthony had great hair plugs.  Well, this is my ex-m version.  I learned that Jimmy's ex-girlfriend wouldn't eat his ass unless he got a hepatitis test.  Holy shit.  We did learn that this past year.  Oh, right.  Longer than that.  Was that longer than a year?  Yeah.  Sometimes you get confused what happens.  You did that in this special, right? 
[02:58:00]  Oh, did I?  Yeah, maybe I did.  I haven't seen Monster Ranch in so long.  I wanted to see, I want to ask him, do you say, do you have a joke where you go, her pussy was like an unmade bed?  Did you say that one time?  No, I say it was, that's funny.  That's really funny, though.  No.  I have a lot of pussy references, but I do not say that one.  Yeah, you have some of the, I would say in comedy that you have some of the best pussy rep, like especially to the beefy pussy.  Oh, thank you.  Like you, you've like cornered that.  Like cornered that market?  Like if anybody even goes like, I'm like, well, you know, Jim has a really good joke. 
[02:58:30]  Well, Jimmy, what's your-  It's a niche market.  Yeah.  Jimmy, what's your favorite one?  I mean, you do have many, but what?  I don't remember, man.  I know I've said it looks like you just smoked an exploding cigar.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  Because remember I checked with you when we did the special, I go, it looks like a corned beef sandwich with not enough bread.  That's funny.  Yeah.  I've had that one.  Young Lily, we, you know, cupping it, I didn't get a full feel, but I assume it's-  Lily's a small type.  Puffy? 
[02:59:00]  Did you feel any puff?  No.  Lily's got like a small little wet, tight-lipped veg.  Nice.  Like a fortune cookie?  Yeah, like it's not going to give up any secrets.  It's too bad when you-  I like one that gives up secrets.  Now, I think I have a question for the quote bosses.  Oh, boy.  If we, like, run, like, credit cards through her pussy, and I'm sure she'll let us do that, is that considered insertion?  I wouldn't think it is because- 
[02:59:30]  Steve!  You're talking just the slit, right?  Yes, this is our big end-of-the-year show.  We want to run credit cards through Lily's pussy.  Through her slit.  Yeah, through her slit.  Not in the hole.  Just through the labia majora.  Yeah, so call those guys that don't get our show and see what they say to that one.  And I want an answer.  I will absolutely call them.  Can I recruit them?  What?  Sorry, I got stuck in-  And ask if they accept American Express.  Oh, all right.  Because that's what we're using.  Let me go take care of that right now. 
[03:00:00]  I was going to say, can I pretend that I called them and then-  No, just fucking stop being scared.  No, it's nothing to do with scared.  I can just predict the answer.  Why?  It's not insertion.  Stop fucking calling me with these questions.  Well, tough shit.  It's time to learn the show.  Now, call that guy.  It's a lesson.  Tough nerds.  Tell them this is today's lesson.  Today's lesson that we have to give them is, we're going to see, it's not penetration.  Right.  Because it's just the slit.  That little slit.  Swiping.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  And then you swipe the card through the slit.  Yeah, where's Lily?  And she goes, beep.  Oh, God.  If she does the beep part.  She has to go, beep.  Lily, will you let us slide credit cards through your pussy?  Or at least one, just to end the show in style.  End the year in style.  But I don't want it on camera.  No, wouldn't they?  Oh, my God.  Who gives a shit about those assholes?  It's for us.  Edging.  I mean, I'll do it.  I can do it myself, like, under the console.  Yeah.  Yeah, tell Steve that she's going to do it herself so she's in complete control. 
[03:01:00]  Can I pretend to drop my keys and look?  Yes.  What are you doing?  Everybody drops something at once.  Can I jerk off and yell, we need a manager here?  Oh, man.  And you want the beep, right?  Let's hear your beep.  You're good, Lily.  Credit card's going through, and now we want to hear your beep.  Oh, my God.  Request the beep.  Beep.  Good beep.  Is that a good beep, Ant?  Nah, it wasn't very good.  Beep.  Yeah.  That was a gun to your head. 
[03:01:30]  Sheep.  Beep.  Beep.  All right, let me go to the phones.  Lady Trucker is a regular, and I don't like to let her wait, ever.  Lady Trucker, what are you hauling today?  I am hauling sailboat fuel.  Sailboat fuel?  She's empty.  Oh, is that what it's called?  Yeah.  I don't know the jargon.  That's funny.  It's like I'm hauling screen doors for submarines.  Oh, sailboat fuel.  Sailboat fuel. 
[03:02:00]  Air.  Yeah.  Oh.  But some sailboats have fuel when they're not using their cells.  He should have said severed headhats.  Lady Trucker, what do you got for the show?  Good morning.  Well, I believe that if you're on the credit card through Lily's ass, that'll be approved  because you can do that with both sexes.  No.  I'm, yeah.  You don't learn that in school.  You learn it on the road.  Well, Steve's here with the obvious answer. 
[03:02:30]  Thanks, Lady Trucker.  All right.  Y'all have a happy new year.  Bye-bye now.  Bye-bye.  Yes, Steve.  I really have to negotiate some stupid shit for this radio show.  The answer is running a credit card through qualifies as penetration, so there's no penetration  even if she does it herself.  However, if the implement was to just touch the outside and not penetrate, that's okay.  So basically we can go, are you going to be a bit on the lips with the credit card? 
[03:03:00]  How about that then?  How about this?  Somebody moves the credit card back and forth, of course, her vaguely lips, and she has her  hand by her face and goes, are you doing it?  Nice.  This is bargaining.  Well, listen.  I just want to talk.  So to the audience, we'll do exactly that.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  All right.  See, we negotiated.  It's easy when we all are on the same page.  Oh, boy.  Lily. 
[03:03:30]  Get your slit back in here.  Jeez.  You have to ask nicely.  All right, Lily.  You heard the rules, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Whose credit card are we using?  There's Danny Smith.  You want a really declined credit card?  That's a debit card.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And we're going to do this now.  I'm waiting.  Are we doing the...  Don't say that, because now we're going to get the panicky Pete's back on the floor. 
[03:04:00]  What?  Which credit card are we careful?  Mm-hmm.  What is it?  It's the other side.  Oh.  All right.  It's got a bank card.  Yeah.  I love a bank card.  Hold on.  Let's go to Danny in New York.  They remember your pussy references, Jimmy.  Danny, go ahead.  Hey.  I got one of those references that Dave was talking about.  About a pussy.  Okay.  I saw you in Poughkeepsie, and you said you enjoy a pussy that looks like a basset hound wearing  a miner's helmet.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  Good one.  That's right.  That's a good one.  I thought of one, too, actually.  One of my favorites was when Jim says he likes a vagina that could easily fit on a Brontosaurus. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  And what is it?  All right.  Merry Christmas, boys.  All right.  That was a good one.  Let me go back to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah.  I like his reference where he talks about a poorly packed luggage.  Oh, see.  Okay.  Did I say that?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was the unmade bed.  Dude, this is your third book.  Just a tiny little book of all your pussy references.  Yeah, like one for each day.  Yeah.  Like you pull it off in the morning.  Yeah.  Like a far side calendar. 
[03:05:00]  Wow.  Look.  Come to the day line.  Day old pudding.  It's not a bad idea.  Our listeners would eat that shit up.  All right.  Lily, you know what's going to happen here?  I'm just going to graze it against my labia.  Look at me and Anthony.  Yes.  That's exactly what you're going to do.  Okay.  Right, audience?  Yes.  That's right.  Yes.  You're our witnesses.  Yes.  They are witnessing that we're doing exactly what the boss said. 
[03:05:30]  Right, Ed?  Of course.  Okay.  It can't be any other way.  No.  Boss is no best.  That's what we say around the office.  That's right.  Remember before we were walking over where you said, like, how you doing?  You said, well, it depends.  Whatever the boss says, I think is good.  Whatever you said, boss.  Boss knows best.  All right.  Lily doesn't want anyone to see this, so Lily, if you will.  But how are we supposed to know she's really doing it?  The beep beep.  That's why Anthony's brilliant.  Somebody didn't pick up on the hint, hint.  It's amazing when a couple of guys are shoving their balls.  Jimmy, make sure.  But Liz is going to rub it on her vagina. 
[03:06:00]  So they got to let her go into the console.  Yeah.  How do I get this shit duty?  All right.  You can go under there.  Beep.  Beep.  Right?  I won't look.  Why are you holding the microphone when she's got one right by her mouth?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I was told to go in and put it on there.  By the way.  Put it on the credit card?  I was pointed in there.  What incompetent told you that?  Travis.  All right.  He's a girl.  He knows a thing or two about clits.  Yeah.  Dave in Philly, my favorite is a pussy he can see through snow pants.  Yeah.  That's a good one, too.  That's coming in a lot, actually.  The space to it, too. 
[03:06:30]  What's the one where you go, you can pull the lips over your head and something Civil War  reenacted?  What was it?  I don't remember.  All right.  Beep, beep.  All right.  It's already.  You're beep beeping?  Yeah.  You ready?  It's already in there.  Well, not in there because that can't be in there.  What she means is it's in her pants.  Right.  All right.  She means it's in her pants.  What she's doing, basically, is taking the filthiest credit card in this building.  Yeah.  Purell it. 
[03:07:00]  I didn't even think of that.  All right.  You just keep beep beeping, and when we hear beep beep, we know it's being done.  Yeah.  Give it a beep beep.  I'm going to put the whole thing in.  Beep beep.  I'm kidding.  That's the one I used to pick my teeth with.  Jesus.  I can only imagine where that credit card's been.  Oh, it's awful.  Beep beep.  Oh, there we go.  Dave, you like the beep beep?  This is like beyond theater of what happened here?  Exactly.  So that was it? 
[03:07:30]  I mean.  Yeah, that's all you get.  How did it feel?  Was it cool?  It was surprising.  Compared to a Metro card, did it feel different?  What are we trying to get out of it?  Maybe we can let you do it with Fonzie's library card.  Do you think you could?  No.  Do you think?  Yes.  Now the audience is turning on you.  The audience is booing Jimmy.  They rarely turn on Jimmy.  Oh, they're right, though.  God damn it.  I can't fault them.  Those are people with taste.  Steve in New Hampshire.  Yes.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you missed the most famous one, the wizard sleeve. 
[03:08:00]  The wizard sleeve?  That's not mine.  That's not mine.  That's hilarious.  Whose is that?  That's Sasha Cohen.  Oh, really?  The wizard sleeve?  It looks like sleeve of wizard.  That's where I am.  Yeah.  All right.  I don't steal people's big cunt jokes.  Let's say hi to John.  John.  Hi, John.  John.  Hi, John.  Hello.  Hi.  Hi, John.  One of Jimmy's other references was one of the older days.  I don't know if it was Dr. Ruth, but it looked like Albert Einstein eating a London Royal. 
[03:08:30]  That's not mine.  Nice.  Ah.  That's not mine.  Yeah, any of those would be mine.  The hairy bush would look like.  It also looked like someone dropped a pack of chewed hubba-bubba on the barbershop floor.  That's good.  That was a good answer fan of the hairy bush, Dave.  Is it a really?  Fidel Castro with pyorea.  Yeah, any of the hairy pussy analogies.  Yeah.  Do you shave your thingy? 
[03:09:00]  I couldn't get a feel on it.  You do, right?  It's the staying age.  They all do.  Yeah.  She leaves a little.  You'll never see a hairy bush anymore.  I'll leave a little now, because I haven't been with anyone for a while, but he's always  all shaved.  Why don't you show Dave?  He's a big comedian, Jim.  Well, I kind of feel like I got, you know, I shot my imaginary load on that imaginary rubbing  a cord on a...  Yeah.  Imaginary, imaginary.  There is a little discussion going on about the fact that I don't think, and other people  agreed, that girls can even grow pussy hair like they could in the 70s. 
[03:09:30]  Like, I think evolution happened in 30 short years.  They've evolved because they shave so much and wax so much that pussy hair is just becoming  like a thing of...  Dude.  Dude, dude.  Have you seen fucking 70s pussy?  Yeah.  Why don't we do the hairy pussy contest?  I'd love to.  Screw this afro thing and this beard growing contest. 
[03:10:00]  The hairiest pussy contest.  Steve?  Are we doing...  We won.  We won.  Oh, that was it.  Line of the day was brought to you by Jim Norton at the Borgata.  For a third show.  Oh, my God.  When is that?  January 18th.  18th.  Holy shit.  Are we doing Miss...  Sam, are we doing Miss Rotten Crotch? 
[03:10:30]  Yes.  When are we doing Miss Rotten Crotch?  Do we have the promos running?  I don't know.  Dave, we're searching for...  I don't know.  We're searching for the most rotten smelling pussy.  What happened?  How'd that happen?  I thought we were going for the hairy.  Well, maybe that's like a side thing.  Are you going to bring in the blind?  The hairy.  Like, are you going to have a blind guy?  We're going to have a bunch of guys smelling.  And the beauty is, a girl could have a nice smelling pussy, but the whole thing is,  what could you do to it to make it the worst smelling pussy? 
[03:11:00]  Maybe we could do some kind of...  Do we have a sponsor yet?  I'm sure we could get one.  Maybe something like Vagina Olympics, we could have different categories of, you know,  hairiest, smelliest, maybe the best smelling one.  Well, why don't we set a date for this Miss Rotten Crotch, and let's just do it.  February 1st, what day is that?  That's my sober anniversary.  It'd be a very good day.  Wake up and smell the Rotten Crotch.  Well, the first is Sunday.  We can do the second.  Feb 2nd is a Monday.  All right, we're doing, well, 2-2. 
[03:11:30]  February 2nd is Miss Rotten Crotch Day.  Why don't we just do it on Valentine's Day?  On Valentine's Day.  Yeah, you're right.  I'm sure we'll have some...  Isn't that a Japanese game show already?  Yeah.  It seems like one of those where they, like, go in the glory hole and they've got to smell it,  or, you know, is that your wife?  Is that, you know, your aunt?  You know, that kind of thing.  That's great.  Yeah, they take it to a different level over there.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Steve in California. 
[03:12:00]  Steve, good evening.  Hey.  Hi.  That's you, Steve.  Yeah?  Oh, sorry.  Welcome aboard.  One of Jimmy's references is he likes one that looks like a chimp's mouth.  Oh, yeah.  A chimp's mouth.  A chimp's mouth.  Right.  Hey, let's go back to Lily.  Lily, are you in as far as Miss Rotten Crotch goes?  Why?  You don't have, you add stuff to it to make it smell bad for that day.  Yeah, but how do I know it'll go away?  You don't have to go unshowered or any of that crap. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, that's how you win, I guess, if you just don't shower and roll around.  Yeah.  Yeah, but then it won't go away.  Wow.  If we don't get women for this, we're going to look stupid on February 2nd.  Yeah.  There are women out there willing to do this, and February 2nd is Groundhog Day.  How about that?  How about make it, how about open up?  How about open it up?  It's kind of funny.  You make it like ass, puss, or foreigner.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, like you have three of those things.  Hey, I like that.  I like Groundhog Day.  Maybe we bring in Puxatawney Phil. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  And whichever pussy makes him pass out is the winner.  People love that it's on February 2nd because it's Groundhog Day.  It's coming in.  He shoves his head in the pussy, and if he sees the apocalypse, you're the winner.  Puxatawney Phil.  Yeah.  Oh, I like to fucking, I would like to bury a hatchet right in that fucking thing.  Like, I despise Puxatawney Phil.  Who likes him?  You get like a rescue dog, and he runs away.  We don't even go in there.  Are we going to have women doing this or what?  Yep.  You think we're going to...  Open it up to the she-males. 
[03:13:30]  Why haven't we done nothing with frannies?  I mean, there's so much fun.  I mean, there's on-air personalities.  Of course.  All right.  Well, we're going to work on Miss Rotten Crotch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please.  You know, we finally got to do the gay nursing home thing.  We've been teasing this for about a week or two.  That story's been sitting there.  Dave, you'll love this one.  Is there a gay nursing home?  Well, listen to this.  Listen to this, my friend.  When Otto K. Heurich visits his nursing patient, Peter Mahling, the two talk about a lot of things, 
[03:14:00]  including guys.  Peter Mahling is a gay man enjoying his retirement years.  He says he wants a nursing service that understands.  What if I have a photo of my boyfriend on the table, he says.  With normal nursing services, I would have to explain, or I would lie and say it's my brother or something.  I have to go into hiding in many ways.  Shut up.  Well, where is this? 
[03:14:30]  It's in Germany there, Dave.  Or is it in this country five years from now?  We'll take the gay war to the next level.  They cater to the gay elderly.  Really?  At this place in Germany?  Who cares if you have a picture of your boyfriend on the nightstand?  Who gives a shit?  Yeah.  Otto K. Heurich runs one of the few nursing services that caters specifically to the needs of older gays and lesbians.  He says it's a market with a massive growth potential, 
[03:15:00]  and that many other projects like gay retirement homes and community housing projects are already in the works.  Gays simply don't want to face discrimination during the final years of their lives, he says.  During the Nazi era.  Like they had to say after that quick sound clip perked right up there.  No kidding.  That's a showstopper.  What was Hitler saying?  It was probably something really liberal.  We have to be gentle and kind with our gay community.  Yeah. 
[03:15:30]  ...their lives, he says.  During the Nazi era, gays and lesbians were thrown into concentration.  No.  Of course that sort of person is unthinkable today.  Jesus, Hitler sounded hot under the collar.  Yeah.  Always stink.  They say, especially among the older generation, discrimination is still rampant.  In Germany?  Really?  You'd think they'd be so, yeah.  Open-minded.  Is there anything over there they like?  There's still a country just not willing to really be honest about who they are. 
[03:16:00]  They're on time, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, those trains.  Gay nursing home.  I like the sound of it.  We're becoming a very expensive cell phone right now.  Christina in Texas.  Christina?  Hey.  Welcome aboard.  Am I bored?  No, welcome aboard.  I'm not be bored when I listen to you guys.  Well, thank you.  But you want to say hi to your husband?  No, I wanted you guys to say hi. 
[03:16:30]  He's one of y'all's biggest fans, and he's a bull hauler.  And he's overworking and caught pneumonia, and then it turned into spinal meningitis.  Is this a country song?  That's sad.  They say that happens if you put your mouth on the bull's penis.  Well, that's sad.  I'm sorry.  Well, hey, he'd laugh about that.  But anyway, he's in Austin at Breckenridge Hospital there, and he's an avid fan of you  guys.  This is calling. 
[03:17:00]  Well, what is, miss, what is this sickly idiot's name?  We all say hello to him.  Jesus.  Don Lachey.  Hi, Don.  Hope you feel better.  Does he have his...  Yes, Don.  Does he have his...  Hey, we haven't been receiving any calls from Wildman Jim.  What's that, sweetie?  I said we haven't been receiving any calls.  I'll be making some more updates before the new year.  Yeah.  I apologize.  I've been very negligent.  All right, Christina.  Thanks for completing us off on the show.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You know. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, straight dick from North Carolina.  Right, yes.  I'm bored now.  Of course you are.  Hey, Stalker Patty's here.  Stalker Patty.  Ah.  I have a quick question.  I have a bunch of trouble on the...  Yeah, you're the troublemaker from Friday.  Where's the bitch?  Miss Angel Beads herself.  How are you, Patty?  I'm doing...  I'm doing...  Why would the mic work?  Oh.  I'm just down real low and hide.  I'm here because I'm doing a song for Fezzy later.  Well, come over here.  So I got to practice.  What's the name of the song?  Hey, Patty.  Santa Fezzy. 
[03:18:00]  Santa Fezzy.  Yep.  Can we get a little taste of it?  Oh, no, no.  I didn't do it yet.  I have to do it with Dave first a few times.  I got to practice.  What boots are you wearing?  Uggs.  No, I don't think so.  I can't afford those, but I got the next best thing.  Those are actually shoes with toilet seat covers taped around the table.  Patty.  You got them in Payless?  Patty, let me ask you something.  You pay too much.  Let me ask you something for real.  When Ankos, what kind of shoes are you wearing?  Are they, you know, Uggs? 
[03:18:30]  No.  Why do you feel like you have to answer that as a real question?  Yeah.  I never understand that about you after all these years.  Oh, sorry.  I know you mean it.  It's a retardical question.  It doesn't need an answer.  I know you mean it sarcastically.  So why would you answer that?  She's no improv.  We came from Payless.  But we didn't want to know the answer.  You got them for Payless.  So did you pay less?  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  For someone that listens to this show so close, like you, you really have never learned  anything from us. 
[03:19:00]  It's bizarre to me.  Can I say hi to Patty?  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Can I say what you do?  Yeah, it's okay.  Well, that's not my wife.  She works at one of the coffee places.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, she's always keeping me up to date on everything and, you know.  Oh, isn't coffee news great?  Well, the new things just came, man.  Sorry for treating her like a person.  Now scrape something on your smasher.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, I give him nice, courty service.  Yeah, you're very good.  What kind of service are you supposed to give him?  Throw it in his face?  Scalding coffee in the face.  She lets me milk a decaf as I peruse a Somali boy soldier biopic.  Oh, I read that one.  It was good, right?  Oh, yeah.  What's courtesy?  Better out of me.  What is courtesy service, by the way?  It means treating the customer with respect, giving them what they want.  If they get mad, you don't get mad back.  How about, is this rude or pro?  Try that one out.  If somebody says, I'd like a medium coffee, if you say, well, then cup your hands, shit dick. 
[03:20:00]  That's rude.  Okay, good.  And I should have put C. Is it rude, not rude, or B, C, unfunny?  It would have been rude and unfunny.  B, rude.  All right.  Hey, Patty, would you be part of our Miss Rotten Crotch contest?  Because I'm trying to get something going, and so far I'm failing miserably.  But not today.  It would be on February 2nd, Groundhog Day.  That's all right.  I don't have a rotten one at all. 
[03:20:30]  I'll be a sport.  Can E-Rock smell her pussy?  Did you shower yet today?  What?  E-Rock!  Did you work?  Did you work hard?  Did you sweat a little bit this morning?  I worked this morning, yeah.  Oh, perfect.  Yeah?  She probably took a latte dump.  Oh, I think he should check the rear.  Why?  I think he should just E-Rock.  I don't have anything going on.  E-Rock, would you mind smelling her crotch and her fart box?  And her, yeah.  Yeah.  Front and the back.  Patty, come on.  Smell the front door and the back door. 
[03:21:00]  Go ahead.  Drop your jeans so E-Rock gets in there.  So he gets just undies.  Yeah, just undies.  Patty, would you be the star of Miss Rotten Crotch?  Star?  I don't know.  We might have a good cash prize, though.  Make you a star.  And this is how the contest works.  I mean, if you want to not shower for a while to make it smell, it's fine.  But women can just do whatever they...  I don't want to get anything but go ahead.  It's going to be rough.  They could just rub rotten food on their...  I'm a dead cat.  This would be better held outdoors. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  All the way down.  All the way down.  Why?  So he can get his nose in there.  Not in there.  Don't worry.  Oh, God is.  You just perish the thought.  You got a little crazy there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Nice camel toe on Patty.  Yeah, what's going on?  Exactly.  Shit.  I mean, you've got this weird like for her.  No, I don't.  You like her ass and stuff.  I don't have anything going on.  Come on.  Get with it.  She has a nice dumper, though.  All right, Iraq.  What do you want to smell first, Iraq? 
[03:22:00]  The back door or the...  Stop.  Not all the way.  Not all the way.  She's mortified.  Get in there.  Give a good sniffing.  Aren't you going to pull them down?  What are they doing up?  What are the pants doing up?  Davis.  Those are the same ones she had on last time.  Are they?  Yeah.  There's nothing else.  Stop it.  How many pairs of panties do you have, Patty?  What, do you have one pair of panties?  That was the same pair Friday.  Patty?  I wash three times a week.  Three times a week?  How many pairs do you have?  I don't know about... 
[03:22:30]  Why?  How many do you have?  I have a load three times a week and I run them in the washroom.  How many panties do you own?  I don't even know.  I never count as...  Like two?  About?  About 12, 13.  I don't know.  But you wash them three times a week?  Yeah, I do.  So I always have clothes.  Oh, God.  That voice.  Especially with my work clothes.  I got to wash them every day sometimes.  Yeah.  Dave, you want to have more small talk with Patty as she's standing there awkwardly?  I'm really uncomfortable.  Hands down. 
[03:23:00]  Of course you are.  I've got the reverse hard arm going right now.  Yeah.  No.  Patty.  Look at how the front of her sweatshirt...  Don't you get something out of it?  I mean...  I don't know.  Patty, you've got to pull your underpants down.  Pull those sexy underpants down.  Why?  Because we can smell your vag and hiney hole.  You can do...  You can smell it this way.  No, we can't.  You can smell it this way.  Hine hole.  You don't have to smell your tuchus.  By the way, the phones are not ringing for our Miss Rod contest.  No.  Very disappointed in the ladies out there. 
[03:23:30]  Patty.  You've got to start this contest.  Calm down.  No one's going to touch you?  Yeah, come on.  Oh.  Don't be so shy.  You've shown me a vagabonding.  I'm right here.  Back.  What?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  Open your cheeks, Patty.  Here goes Iraq.  Wait, do you want Patty to bend over?  Patty, just bend over.  Touch your toes.  There's no camera.  There you go.  I can't bend over.  All right.  That's as far as I can go.  She's got arthritis.  Open your cheeks, Patty.  All right.  She's opening her cheeks.  Get in there, Iraq.  No.  Use your hand. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, open them up.  Later on, is it a three-man job?  Look at that.  Patty, pull them apart.  I can't.  Look, you got a big log stuck in there.  Yeah, union work.  I don't have anything.  All right.  Go ahead there, Iraq.  All right.  We got a big log.  Get in there.  No, it smells like fabric softener.  How about the veg?  All right.  How about doing the, she hasn't shaved in four weeks veg?  Did you shave, Patty?  I don't care.  What the hell?  You haven't shaved?  Oh.  I don't feel like it sometimes. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't look like it either.  I would never feel like it.  Yeah.  It's cold out.  It's cold out.  All right.  By the way, later on this morning, Ron and Fez will be showing Stalker Patty a lot of respect  down there, Joe.  I know.  Yeah.  Therein lies the difference.  All right.  Hold this up.  Now.  Get it over with.  All right.  It's difficult.  All right.  Oof.  Yes.  Oof.  Oof.  Iraq?  You're just playing.  No. 
[03:25:00]  A little pigeon.  Iraq?  Wow.  It's very vinegary.  Why is there vinegar down there?  I don't know.  It's very...  Do you wipe after your tinkle?  It's called the soup and salad, Phyllis.  Balsamic?  It's correct.  Wait.  You think Iraq's faking?  Someone else has to smell it.  No.  Come on.  That's enough.  I know it's not a guy, but...  I have in the past, if you remember.  And I'll...  No, I'm just saying. 
[03:25:30]  I'll concur with Eric.  Danny, go over there.  Yes.  I already know what it is, though.  Yeah.  Oh, it is.  It should get somebody new in there.  I already know it as well.  It's vinegary...  All right, Danny, get in there.  Kind of vinegary, pissy.  No.  Is it pissy and vinegary, Jack?  Iraq, what do you mean by vinegary?  Just...  It's got a little B.O., but it's...  Like some moisture that's just kind of trapped.  Oh, now I'm embarrassed.  Oh, Patty.  Don't be embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Oh, Patty.  Oh, Patty, come on. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, this is your line after all these years?  It's okay.  Oh, mausoleum veg.  Do you think, if you smelled any one of these guys' balls...  Oh, now he got the nut.  She was bent over a couch, and we were hurling cherries at her asshole.  Yeah.  And now she's embarrassed.  Yeah, she's embarrassed.  Yeah, cherry dogs.  Well, Ann makes a good point.  Yes, we know.  Shut it.  Ann makes a good point.  You want to smell someone's ball back?  Yeah, smell one of the guy's balls, and you'll be like, oh, my God, that doesn't smell good.  No, I wouldn't do that.  And the guy would be like, yeah, I got sweaty balls.  Ew, no.  He wouldn't be, I'm embarrassed.  Yeah, that's disgusting. 
[03:26:30]  E-Rock, you want to let her smell your ball back?  All right, Patty, you're going to smell E-Rock's balls.  He's reaching his hand down his pants.  He's reaching down, he's rubbing his balls, and now you give it...  Why are you rubbing it?  To give a smell, smell the hand, smell his hand.  Yeah, and don't shove it in her face.  No, no, no.  Patty, we wouldn't do that to you.  Just smell his hand.  Just smell it.  So you know, and tell us what it smells like.  Smell!  I just...  Ew!  Ew!  It smells like guy.  It smells like a German.  Ew!  Oh, it smells like guy? 
[03:27:00]  Yes.  Those are balls for you.  It is so guy.  It is so guy.  It's so guy.  Yeah?  How do you know?  How do you know what a guy smells like?  Well, I don't know.  I think men smell differently than women.  But you just smelled the guy's balls, but you've never been with a guy.  I didn't smell...  Yes, you did.  You guys want to build a treehouse out of pillows and fucking...  Ew!  All right, well...  Patty, very good. 
[03:27:30]  Does she have a racing strip in her panties there, Iraq?  Oh, I didn't see.  Yeah, can you check that out?  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  What's a racing strip?  I need to inspect the undies.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Okay, these are my undies.  Yes.  All right.  No, no, stand straight.  Now pull them down.  You need some...  Or no, just pull them out there.  Yeah, pull them out so you can look down the back.  Is there any...  I don't have that.  This is like residue. 
[03:28:00]  It's like Schindler's list without the laughs.  It's very faint.  It's very faint.  This is very...  It really is horrible.  It's like, take off your clothes, ready for shower.  I will.  Leave them over here.  They will be given back to you when you leave.  You will get a hot meal and work.  Work is good.  You will be all kept together when you get to the family camp.  Why were they saying family camps?  That was not true.  Oh, literal gym. 
[03:28:30]  They were lying.  Yes, the Nazis lied.  Family camp.  Patty?  Yeah?  You have a little racing stripe, I guess.  Not really.  I don't even know what a racing stripe is.  A racing stripe is...  I've never seen one.  Yes, you have.  It's in your underwear if maybe you have an itchy hiney hole and you're scratching it.  And then you look at your underwear and you see a little...  It looks like someone rubbed a Hershey's kiss in there.  Oh, no.  I've never had that before.  Yes, you have.  Oh, yes, you have.  Yes, you have.  We all have, Patty.  No. 
[03:29:00]  We've all had the flow.  Liar, liar.  None of my pants have that.  We've all been scared by an uncle.  All right, Patty.  Wow.  Okay.  We look forward to hearing your song with Dave, Eastside Dave, on the Rod and Fez show,  noon to three today.  Right on.  Yep.  All right.  Yep.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good job, Patty.  Thank you.  See you later, Patty.  I didn't get my Christmas gift, Patty.  No Christmas gift.  Oh, by the way, thank you to Steve.  Yeah, no gift.  Steve won.  Oh, my goodness. 
[03:29:30]  Of course, Steve.  Steve won.  Oh, maybe we shouldn't say anything.  I sort of couldn't afford to do a lot of Christmas this year because I've not been good with money  lately.  When's the last time you...  Did you eat last night?  Yeah.  Did you eat, Patty?  Have you been eating?  But anyway, I'll make it up to you on your birthday.  Patty, have you been eating a lot?  What?  Have you been eating, at least eating?  Yeah, I do.  Well, then stop wasting all that money on food.  No.  No, it's just that I got a ton of financial things going on, so... 
[03:30:00]  Oh, boy.  For a 1K.  Yeah.  What happened?  Hey, you want 100 bucks for Christmas?  What happened?  You were investing with that Madoff guy?  That's funny.  A lot of financial calls, huh?  How about this?  What?  If Patty...  Can I...  Oh, no.  Can I fart in your face and I'll give you 100 bucks?  No, I don't want to...  Patty, it's 100.  Are you kidding me?  I was going to just hand it to you, but that's too much like a charity thing.  Patty, $100.  It's not...  Yeah, it's not easy, Monty.  It's not the flu.  It might come out wet. 
[03:30:30]  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  Come on, Patty.  Come on, it's Christmas.  How about this?  $100.  How about this?  If you let me fart on your hand.  That's a little better than my face.  And I get to wash my hands afterwards, too.  Yeah, but...  In the face.  How about your hair?  It has to be in the face.  For $100, it's got to be in the face.  $100 in the face.  Jesus Christ.  I mean, that's disgusting.  It's $100.  That's not disgusting.  It's a game show.  Right.  It's like a game show. 
[03:31:00]  Just make believe you're on a Japanese game show.  Yeah, and you've got to stay there.  I can't take these off in case other things happen.  No, no, no, of course, dude.  I can't do it.  How funny would that be?  Not very.  Patty, put your nose down.  All right, Patty.  The way to end the year.  It's a game show.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Oh, my God.  Stay there.  You've got to stay.  This is worse than waterboarding.  Look at it.  Did you get me?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:31:30]  I couldn't do it.  What's it like, Patty?  But here's the real catch.  She wiped his ass with that bill.  Patty, what do you think?  What does it smell like?  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry, Jimmy.  Was it bad?  Well, you're strong.  Let's put it at that.  You're like 200 proof, I'd say.  Anybody else have a fart?  Worst improv ever.  I'm still fanning the air. 
[03:32:00]  I'm sorry.  It's lingers.  You're on a roll.  What do you eat?  Not to mention, you do it really loud.  Anybody else have a fart of brewing for Patty?  You really do it loud.  Janet, you're usually good for one.  What the fuck?  I got nothing today.  I really don't.  I hadn't tried.  I had a bad day yesterday.  Not today, though.  I'm recovering.  You got another one, Jimmy?  I can.  No?  That was nice, though.  I can breathe again.  We're lucky that stayed.  You're a prince. 
[03:32:30]  What pattern?  I got tears in my eyes.  Oh, you're still improv.  It's cool.  You put tears in my eyes, Jimmy.  I love her.  Still improv.  Did you see that there was a fart and then there was like a little teaser at the end for  the next shit coming?  Are you loud or not?  You heard it?  You could hear that from across the street.  Really?  Could you?  Yes.  Wow.  That improv is fantastic.  I'm all right.  It was like a trailer for a dump he's going to take in an hour. 
[03:33:00]  You rock.  You got a fart?  I'm trying to work one up, but.  Are you all right?  Yeah, I'm all right.  Dave's going to look at you differently the next time he orders his coffee.  You know what goes good with a good fart in the face?  Ice cream cake.  Bring it out.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Oh, yeah.  What?  Happy birthday.  Improv, right? 
[03:33:30]  Holy Jesus.  I don't even know what that meant.  You know what?  I don't know.  What the hell is that over here?  I mean, you leave a nap the flavor.  A nap the flavor.  A nap the taste.  That was a side one.  A little second one.  He caught her on the side of the hill.  He pulled a Kennedy.  I did.  I just knocked it out in a 50th part.  That's definitely worth my money.  Definitely.  Yeah?  No.  I definitely have to do a lot more than that for $100.  Because I'm going to remember that now.  Can we come on your face? 
[03:34:00]  Nothing.  What are we doing?  Oh, it's 11 o'clock.  See you next.  Bye.  No, I'm serious.  No more overtime.  Dave, Caroline's.  December 26th through the 30th.  I'll be a crocodile rock.  Everybody seems so emotionally wounded now.  Yeah, I'll be a Caroline's.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  I can't top that far to get the face thing.  How can you?  Days of Caroline's.  I'll be a crocodile rock in Allentown on New Year's Eve.  And the Borgata 16, 17, 18. 
[03:34:30]  That's Martin Luther King weekend.  Really?  The 18th, third, and final show went on sale.  Mud Valve is suggesting that Patty turn her panties inside out.  For what reason?  She's still babbling.  They, like, rushed her out like she had, like, another appointment.  Like she's going to jump in a helicopter.  Right.  Someone's got to take a shit on my foot.  I'm needed.  You've got to get me to New Orleans.  I'm going to wrestle something until it fucks me.  Patty, why are you coming back in?  He just told me to come. 
[03:35:00]  He just went like that.  Who?  Did what?  He's standing over here.  He rocks over here.  You know what would have been cool?  If, like, you were the president.  We had, like, fake security guys running.  Then Norton comes out of a bush.  Farts on your face and runs off, holding Catherine in the rye.  I don't know.  All right.  What's that, Iraq?  Those gifts stink.  Guys, thanks for having me.  I appreciate it.  All right, Dave.  David Teller.  I'm going to go smoke and jerk off.  I'll pass you, man.  David Teller.  Oh, they're giving you some love. 
[03:35:30]  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  You think Patty would go for a Roman war helmet?  Uh, no.  Patty.  Patty.  Who's going to show there?  Iraq, would you show your cock?  What's a Roman war helmet?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Now we have to.  For $100.  I don't want a fucking voodoo doll.  Fuck you.  That scares me.  I'm not touching voodoo dolls.  No effing way.  Burn them.  What the hell is that?  It's a voodoo doll.  Get out of here. 
[03:36:00]  We don't fuck with that shit.  I don't mess with voodoo dolls.  I don't mess with that crap.  I don't do that with voodoo dolls.  Nope.  Nope.  And you've got HBO stuff.  Patty.  Thanks.  Yeah?  A Roman war helmet is very easy.  We have a guy.  Put his two balls on each of your eyes.  And then the, you know, and then the business end of the, you know, what, across your nose.  Don't settle it.  I don't think so. 
[03:36:30]  $100.  It's not happening.  No.  You can keep your voodoo.  Why did somebody put this fucking thing in front of me?  Get rid of the.  Why the fuck did you put a voodoo doll?  Get the fucking fucking fucking thing away from me.  As long as you don't touch it, you're okay.  I touched it.  Oh, boy.  But I didn't do any voodoo shit.  Oh, boy.  I'm giving it to Mama Luke.  I see that.  Oh, you got to cover it a little bit.  I got to go.  By the way, can I say I was watching Letterman last night?  Because it was a big night.  Leno had fucking Robin Williams.  Letterman had Dustin Hoffman. 
[03:37:00]  Jimmy Kimmel had Tom Cruise.  They're all doing giant press.  God bless Letterman.  Because Dustin Hoffman is the most boring motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen him on the end.  He actually told a very funny story at the end.  A tootsie story, but it was actually really funny.  But the first segment, and most of that segment, he is a fucking snooze fest.  Just a bore.  I hate actors, man.  The next time one of these guys blows me off for a photo, I'm just going to go, you're  fucking boring.  Yeah.  You're boring.  You're boring. 
[03:37:30]  Write your shit.  Holy shit.  What made him boring, man.  Just not an ounce of...  I mean, Letterman's so good at interviewing that he kept it interesting.  He kept it a real interview.  You could tell he was showing him a lot of respect.  It was Dustin Hoffman.  Sure.  But just, actors are the worst.  They're fucking just tedious.  All right.  Are we going to get the Roman War helmet done, Nat?  No.  She ain't going to do it.  Patty, $100?  No.  You can keep your glasses on. 
[03:38:00]  You'll have ball prints on them, but...  I've never been that close to anyone like that in my life.  I don't think so.  You can't get any diseases if they rest their penis across your face like that.  Except for herpes.  No.  Not at...  Ew.  I can't even imagine looking at one.  You don't want to...  What's wrong with looking at one?  Ew.  I don't do...  I don't do stuff like that.  Shut up, okay?  You don't do fucking stuff like that. 
[03:38:30]  It's too creepy.  I'm off.  It's vacation time.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'm fucking done.  Thank you to the listeners.  Well, they don't want to acknowledge when we go late, but they certainly acknowledge if we leave early.  Can we say goodbye to the listeners?  Let's say they were...  Oh, they're going to hear us again.  Fuck them.  All right, we'll fuck them, but a nice goodbye for the end of the year.  Yeah.  And now there's Travis' dog, Dexter, getting ripped up.  You sent me a fucking Dexter, the dog card.  Bye, everybody.  Have a nice New Year and holiday and shit.  I think it's an ugly dog. 
[03:39:00]  All right, well.  I'm going to do the rest of the show with the youngins.  Bring in the youngins.  I'll be back.  Sam, Danny, Travis.  Oh, Line of the Day, brought to you by DirecTV.  Safe to say that probably Jimmy had it today.  Although Ann was on fire today.  Ann was on fire.  Dude, I sucked all day.  My apologies to the listeners.  I was sick.  No, you didn't...  I did.  I was slow.  No, Jimmy.  I had no energy, and my fucking improv skills were non-existent.  But it's okay.  I'm fine.  No, Jimmy.  You were...  You were...  You were...  You were...

[03:40:00]  Meat Loaf Sucks.  I don't know what that's about there, E-Rock.  A huge tirade when Meat Loaf failed on coming in on the show.  Oh, the Meat Loaf.  Yeah.  I thought you meant food.  Food.  I really did.  Oh, never.  Oh, yeah.  We went after that asshole.  Intern Adam.  Is he gay and his lies are exposed?  Who was Intern Adam?  Guy from Detroit?  Yeah.  He left his email open and we went through it and found out he was telling people that  he didn't like you guys, but he was hanging out with all the celebrities that were on the show.  Oh, right.  He made believe...  Who was it? 
[03:40:30]  Like Sylvester Stallone?  Sylvester Stallone, who never was in studio.  Lucky us.  They're going to replay the WAAF bra bombing show.  Oh, we did.  Oh, getting a little action out there for that one.  Also, the WAAF sperm ball, bowl 96.  Let it be known...  No, I won't say what I was going to say.  I'll say it after the fact when we get back.  Bobby Lee freaking out.  We're going to replay that during the holiday.  2001 homeless shopping spree.  That's the first one, right?  Second one.  Second one?  We started that in 2000? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  We wanted to do it this year.  No, 99 and you skipped it in 2000.  Wow.  You know more about this show than we do.  And then never aired.  We're going to be doing blind boxing.  A bit Bubba ripped off from us very recently.  But he hates us.  Good job, fat boy.  Peppers and Balls competition featuring the Dudley Boys.  We never play that on Satellite?  Nope.  And musical dildos.  One of my favorite bits.  We're going to be playing for the first time on Satellite Radio while we're gone.  Cool.

We'll see you in the year 2009.  And because Anthony's not here, I get to do this.  What?  I'm not saying that shit.  I get to do this because Ant's not here.  We'll see you guys soon.  Thank you. 
[03:42:30]  Make my way.  Make my way. 
[03:43:00]  I like to drink a little beer.  I'll see you in the next vai.  We're all walking in the town, be like a million miles away.  Now the snow is like a sea, like a sand about the beach.  The lights popping in the trees, the people shining in the street.  And the people in the light, all the children in the light, singing holy, holy night. 
[03:43:30]  The lights popping in the trees, the people in the light, all the children in the light. 
[03:44:00]  I like to sit out on the pier, and look across the bay.  I don't think about a thing, I feel a million miles away.  Like I'm floating from the sky, like a storm of falling stone. 
[03:44:30]  Then I'm spinning through the trees, then I'm shining in the room.  All the people in the light, and all the children in the light.  Singing holy, holy night.  Sweet sleeves with his Christmas song, that's right, on the Opie show.  Let's do requests now.  What do you guys want to hear?  Yeah, let's do a radio show.  What do you want to hear? 
[03:45:00]  Let's play cool songs.  I want to hear, Liquid Todd did a remix of a Christmas song on his Ones and Zero show this past Saturday night.  I want to play that right now.  How do we do that?  How'd it go?  It's a Christmas song.  A remix.  We got Christmas remix.  Liquid Todd, Christmas remix.  I want to play that for everybody right now. 
[03:45:30]  You got it?  Yeah, this might be a tough find.  He does it live.  Huh?  Nah, he didn't spin this one live.  It was someone else's masterpiece.  I'll wait.  I'll wait all day.  Wasn't Liquid Todd on K-Rock a very long time ago?  Yeah, he was on K-Rock, BCN.  He's the master of the mix.  You got it, Travis?  Nope.  You don't listen to Ones and Zeros?  I haven't heard it yet.  Or Zeros and Ones, whatever the fuck?  I want to hear it.  It's like an old school Christmas song. 
[03:46:00]  Maybe someone can help me out out there.  And, uh...  We can't get it.  Why?  He's in the, uh...  He's in the serious system, not the other.  Motherfucker, are you serious?  Yeah, he spins out of the...  What the fuck am I doing on the radio?  We can't find that?  Maybe we have it as something else.  Huh?  No.  Uh, they're requesting shit dick.  All right, let's play shit dick race until we find that.  We could just sing it live, but you can't find it, I guess. 
[03:46:30]  No, I forgot how it goes.  I can't believe that was the one I was going to start my big secret show with.  He's got it.  I hope he's request hour.  What is this?  Oh, this is the Richard Cheese shit dick.  You want the original one?  It's always important to take a good song and...  Uh...  Give it that lounge style.  Hold on, stop a second.  Are people going to understand that it's the Richard Cheese version of shit dick?  Well, I guess now they will.  This is the Ron and Fez warm-up show.  That's what I'm doing now.  All right.  I'm just warming up Ron and Fez.  Keeping the audience here until they get here for their big Christmas show. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, but you let me know that?  That's the only shit dick you could find.  I bet you there's a...  There's probably a few more.  Why don't you check the back office?  I'm sure there's one in there.  Oh, Steve.  Huh?  Daniel's making a Steve joke.  Well, you can't have enough Steve jokes.  No shitties.  All right, we'll play this.  Because now, like, what I want to do, I can't do, so now I've got to do this.

[03:51:30]  Hurts already? Okay.  We're going to get right back into the songs here.  This song is a famous Johnny Cash song, Hurt.  I like the tie-in.  Featuring little Jimmy Norton on your home of rock and roll for the holidays.  Can we get a taste of Johnny Cash doing Hurt?  This song is deeply depressing.  I hurt myself.  Here he goes.  Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. 
[03:52:00]  I should have had Joaquin Phoenix sing this.  I hurt myself today.  I hurt myself today.  Did ya?  To see if I still feel.  Well, do ya?  I focus on the pain.  Did ya?  The only thing that's real.  Is it?  The needle tears a hole. 
[03:52:30]  Does it?  The old familiar sting.  Is it?  Try to kill it all away.  Do ya?  But I remember everything.  Do ya?  What have I become?  My sweetest friend. 
[03:53:00]  Everyone I know  Goes away  In the air  Do they?  All right, we get it.  Yeah, could I?  Let's go to the phones and say hi to Sean in Boston.  Sean, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's happening, man?  Well, it's the Ron and Fez warm-up show starring Opie. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah, I know this.  Yeah.  Um, I think you could play your version of Grandma Got Run Over by a reindeer.  He used to play up here in Boston.  That would be from the Demented World CD.  The one and only CD that we ever put out.  We got lazy after that, I guess.  What track is this?  30.  30?  Wait, what else is on that thing?  I want to play something else off the Demented World first.  100 grand.  Uh, let me see what I haven't heard in a while.  Have we played butt plug in a while? 
[03:54:00]  Uh, I haven't heard in a while.  All right, hold on a minute.  We'll play butt plug and then we'll play your, uh, your Christmas song, all right?  Thank you, sir.  All right.  May I help you?  Yes, uh, butt plugs?  Who?  Butt plugs, please.  Spark plugs, yes, man.  I'm where, how can I help you?  Uh, butt plugs.  What is it?  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Uh, butt plugs.

[03:54:30]  Uh, butt plugs.  Butt, butt box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello?  Uh, what are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug, what kind?  Butt plug.  What kind of a spark plug?  Uh, no, butt plug.  I, I, I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  Uh, butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Bug plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for? 
[03:55:00]  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt.

That was Anthony.  He should re-remake that phone call saying hair plug.  Hair plug.  That's for Anthony in his car.  I'm doing the Ron and Fez warm-up show. 
[03:56:00]  And we're going to do this now.  Taking your request, by the way.  I'm still alive here.  Serving my suspension for being a bad boy last Friday.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Tell us every year, you friggin' nerd.  Glad to hear about your drunken grandma.  That tanked up bitch got just what she deserved.  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas 
[03:56:30]  With the dick that wrote this song  Granny drank whiskey with quaaludes  While toking sense of me and from a bong  I tried to greet his evil grandma  But she kicked me in the nuts  She was sucking on a crack pipe  Yelling, piss off, die, you bastard scumbag butt 
[03:57:00]  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Every time I hear that song I twitch  Don't feel bad about that psycho grandma  Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch  There was dinner on the table  Granny's crawling underneath  Didn't know what she was up to 
[03:57:30]  Till I saw that big old smile on Uncle Pete  Granny left to score some Valium  Took off running down the path  That's when old Saint Nicky creamed her  Grandpa begged Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve 
[03:58:00]  Good riddance to that evil demon grandma  As for me and Grandpa, we're relieved  Oh, Granny was a hole  Shut up, shut up  Hallelujah, hallelujah 
[03:58:30]  Shut up, shut up  Hallelujah, hallelujah  Shut up, shut up  Hollywood Incorporated  Baby changes  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, hallelujah. 
[03:59:00]  Very, very good.  It's the Ron and Fez warm-up show.  That's all I have to say, really.  Let's say hi to Coke Logic.  Coke Logic, how are you, buddy?  I'm fantastic, and happy holidays, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you for a fine year of whatever you do.  What do you do? 
[03:59:30]  Vice-versa.  What do you want to hear today?  I would love to hear Be Retarded by the great Drew Boogie.  We have that all queued up?  All right, it's a twofer from Drew Boogie, because he just did the last one you heard.  Yeah, he's the rock.  By the way, I'm going to play my favorite Christmas song,  because I never was able to reveal that at the end of this hour.  Stick around for my favorite Christmas song of all time.  But first, Drew Boogie, another one.  Hi, who's this?  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses. 
[04:00:00]  R.  Yeah.  E.  Goodness gracious.  T.  Yeah.  A.  Oosh.  R.  D.  T.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  Be retarded.  Be, be, retarded.  Be, retarded.  Be, be, retarded.  Stomp your hands and clap your feet.  Retardation can't be beat.  You know, you know, you know we retarded.  T.  A.  R.  E. 
[04:00:30]  T.  A.  R.  E.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  God, they're not giving me enough time to hang out and just enjoy the songs.  We're going to play Shelter Me next by Grey Wolf.  Bear and Marilyn wants to hear that?  Yes.  All right.  And it's also remixed by the great Drew Boogie.  Enough of this Drew Boogie.  Drew, the great Drew Boogie on MySpace.com.  All right.  One more from Drew Boogie.  Shelter Me, the famous song Grey Wolf did for Ziggy, who has passed on. 
[04:01:00]  Oh, we should play Ziggy's Silent Night today.  Okay.  And I want to play the Santa Claus call that I made back in the day.  Okay.  That kid is now at least 30 years old, but I want to play it one more time.  First this.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I got it right now.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, yeah.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night. 
[04:01:30]  But his voice was rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about tippy-toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All right, yo.  All right, yo.  All right, yo.  He stayed that night, and I got nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off to the wall, my friend. 
[04:02:00]  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you don't have an angel.  And he says,  That ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life. 
[04:02:30]  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  And it's just a little peace. 
[04:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  I was just listening to your station a little while ago.  Yeah.  And I had my three-year-old son with me.  And you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing.  And, oh, it's just your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, you know, I love Opie and Anthony, you know.  And I'm a faithful listener.  But I had to change the station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  I detect that you're a little pissed at us because we just said that there's no Santa Claus on the air. 
[04:03:30]  Well, it would be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night and there wouldn't happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know.  Dude, I just saved you the hassle.  Now you can get the credit for all those presents you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it because he was busy doing something else.  Hey, what's your son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I talk to him real fast?  Why?  What are you going to say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not going to say anything bad, are you?  Oh, I wouldn't do that. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  All right, where's Jeffrey?  I'll get him.  He don't really talk much on the phone, but...  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but...  Oh, that's...  Wait, wait, wait.  Sorry, chill out.  Oh, I...  Okay, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone?  Those guys we were listening to on the radio?  I'm on the floor first.  He's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for doing that? 
[04:04:30]  I better talk to him and then smooth it over.  Okay, well, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  All right.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it.  Come here.  Come here.  Wait, let me get him on my lap.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  It's your dad.  No. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Heartless.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know a Christmas song.  I love all of them.  You want to sing one real fast for us?  Let's see if I can sing it.  All right, let's go.  Silent night.  All right.  Holy night.  All is calm.  All is bright.  I didn't have him pegged as an alto.  All is calm, yon virgin, mother and child. 
[04:05:30]  Holy infant, so tender and mild.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace.  All right.  Let's hear it for Ziggy, huh?  There's Ziggy's version of Silent Night, and, well, sorry to say he's not with us anymore. 
[04:06:00]  And I just told the guys what my favorite Christmas song is, and for some reason, E-Rock laughed openly at me.  He wasn't laughing with me.  He was laughing at me.  What's wrong with that song?  Something traditional.  What the hell, man?  We're going to end with my favorite Christmas song.  It's the Ron and Fez warm-up show.  They got their big Christmas show today, right, Sam?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's going to be a party.  You're really helping me out a lot.  Thanks.  I'm just here basking in your glow.  Robin in Kansas.  How are you, Robin?  Hey, Opie.  I want to know, for all the Einstein's I used to work with before I became a truck driver, 
[04:06:30]  if you would please play Bing Fries Are Done.  I think we could do that.  Let's go right to it.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[04:07:00]  I got to run.  I got to run.  Don't bother me.  I can hop at it.  Really hurt that.  So did you get trapped?  Would you like a number one?  Why would that?  Would you like a number one?  Why would that?  Where is the bell?  Wait for the bell.  Danny's a bell.  Where is the bell? 
[04:07:30]  Ding Fries Are Done.  Ding Fries Are Done.  Ding Fries Are Done.  Ding Fries Are Done.  I was a book a game making.  Playboy Whoppers.  Fly with paper.  We're turning this into the Drew Boogie Hour.  I wanted the original one where it's just nice and easy. 
[04:08:00]  All right.  Well, what the hell.  We're just making this up as we go along.  Warming up for Ron and Fez who are up at noon.  Let's go to Rocky in New Orleans.  Rocky, how are you, buddy?  Doing great.  I'll tell you some gangster fog would sure warm the cockles.  Which song do you want to hear?  Any one would be wonderful.  I forgot.  We haven't played them in so long, I forgot.  Why do you have like a massive scrape on your neck there, Sam?  I have a cat. 
[04:08:30]  Oh, that's a cat scratch?  Yeah.  Which one do you rock?  I don't know the names of them.  I think it's called He Wants It.  They're telling me, Rocky.  This one's for you.  Thank you.  Just taking a request until noon, and we're going to end with my favorite Christmas song,  but first this. 
[04:09:00]  Just kicking back, hanging out in L.A.  When this dude drove by and this really funky band  I could tell right away this motherfucker had hands  Was a white dude, about thirty-something  Kept staring at me, yo, like he wanted something  He called me, yo, and he asked for directions  I saw his dick was hard, so I peeped his car  I said, you dying, you know you ain't lost  You want to suck my dick while I'm jacking you off  And he said, oh no, there must be a mistake  I got a wife and a kid, and I'm very, very straight  So I said, take my number and my name 
[04:09:30]  You can call me up when you're sick of playing games  As I walked away, yo, I knew he would call  Cause if you see one bag, they can see them all  He wants him  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him  So what the fuck you mean?  He wants him  Cause if you see one bag, now you'll see them all  He wants him  So what the fuck you mean?  He needs him  So what the fuck you think?  He wants him  Cause if you see one bag, then you'll see them all  So I knew that he'd be climbing the wall  One week later and he finally called 
[04:10:00]  He said his family's gone for a week or two  And he was really bored and needed something to do  So I drove to his crib up in Beverly Hills  A wrong man's house worth a couple of meals  He said he wasn't gay, he just wanted to chat  And I had five or later, he massaging my back  In his white room, he gave me some hair  Went in the next room and fucked on his kids' bags  Fucked and we fucked like bitches in heat  I came on his face and all over the sheets  I knew that I was done when I started getting sore  I grabbed the kids' toe and I wiped my dick off  He's lying on the bed, still trying to recover  I'm dressed and I'm out as my car burns 
[04:10:30]  He wants him  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him  So what the fuck you need?  He wants him  Cause if you seen one bag, then you seen them all  He wants him  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him  So what the fuck you need?  He wants him  Cause if you seen one bag, then you seen them all  The thing was so good that he just could have passed up  So all night we didn't tear that ass up  Cause he left to ride him and he left to suck him  And after I was done, I let my whole boy fuck him  Now his punk ass calls me everyday  I told him we were through, then he said he was paid 
[04:11:00]  So now twice a week I'm getting paid to tackle  He laced me with the cash and the Visa platinum  One month later and the cash out the bag  Cause this motherfucker started dressing in drag  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him  It was time to cut him off  Because I'm done with him  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg  Screaming don't leave, please twist it G  But this is what you get when you fuck with me  Ha!  He wants him  So what the fuck you think?  He needs him  So what the fuck you need?  He wants him  Cause if you've seen one bag 
[04:11:30]  Then you've seen him all  He wants him  So what the fuck you need?  He needs him  So what the fuck you think?  He wants him  Cause if you've seen one bag  Then you've seen him all  This is Tom's life  Pum is not gay  Okay?
