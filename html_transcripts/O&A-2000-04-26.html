<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a whirlwind of events centered around Anthony's birthday and the launch of "Whip Them Out Wednesday" (WOW).  The show began with the hosts, still recovering from a raucous birthday party the previous night at the Privilege strip club, discussing the distribution of thousands of WOW stickers by Black Earl and Stinky from their new WOW van (an endeavor that ultimately led to a police chase in Washington Square Park).  The party itself was a highlight, with Anthony’s girlfriend Sandy (Rick's sister) and Rick's wife Linda unexpectedly joining in and participating in enthusiastic lap dances, causing chaos that required intervention from bouncers.  Anthony lamented his girlfriend's heavy drinking, which cut short any romantic progress.  Numerous listeners who attended the party called in to share their accounts.

Guests included Elizabeth (who wished Anthony a happy birthday), Joey from Paisano’s (bringing Chimay beer), Steve from the unofficial O&A website (presenting Anthony with a German fisting video), Chippy (a dancer from Privilege), and Jay (a listener).  Black Earl and Stinky also called in live from the WOW van.  The hosts discussed a potential newspaper photo contest comparing their post-party appearance to a picture of Eric Clapton’s child, and engaged in a back-and-forth with a Post photographer who was documenting the events.  The segment also included commentary on uninspired radio commercials.

The show then featured a sexually suggestive song, “Wow,” and calls from listeners, including Edith from California, who was offered a spot on the unofficial website.  The hosts celebrated their growing online audience and the challenges of combating illegal online distribution.  Anthony received further birthday surprises, including food from Joey's restaurant (leading to menu items named after the hosts), and a visit from the comedy duo Otto and George.

The in-studio segment with Otto and George, Jeff Norris, and the puppet George was extremely vulgar, filled with crude jokes, insults, homophobic slurs, and anti-Semitic remarks.  They discussed their upcoming show at Rascals and engaged in offensive exchanges with a caller, Congressman Gary Ackerman.  A “Guess What’s in My Pants” phone game added to the raunchy atmosphere.  The segment also promoted Ranch One restaurant.

The show continued with a rambling discussion about weddings and bridesmaids, leading to a phone call with Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice Clay, initially calling from his truck, complained about traffic and his distrust of dry cleaners, also touching on "a little turmoil" and "pending litigation" in his personal life, using highly colorful language to describe his genitals and sexual exploits. He impersonated Opie and Anthony repeatedly.  Jay Moore joined the conversation, further escalating the crude humor.  The call with Dice Clay was interrupted by poor connection and several tangents before abruptly ending, after which the hosts discussed other guests, including Otto and George, who had been in the studio earlier.

A subsequent segment featured a highly volatile argument between Dice Clay and Jay Moore, alongside discussions about child stars (Macaulay Culkin and Haley Joel Osment), Angie Dickinson, the Elian Gonzalez situation, and the careers of various comedians.  Lewis Black called in to share his views on the Elian Gonzalez situation and various political figures. Adam Ferrara also called in, referencing his upcoming projects and the ongoing “Hospitaliano” joke.  The broadcast concluded with a birthday celebration for Anthony, featuring cake, two women from Privilege, and more phone calls, all within a highly energetic and unpredictable atmosphere. A planned poker game with Adam Ferrara was also mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This happens to be one of my favorite shows.  What did you listen and learn?  I learned that from my ride home, I'm going to wear the pins  because I think that your show is so funny, I'm going to feed myself every day.  Another goal we have, everybody wetting their pants on their drive home.  That's a dumb.  Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?  1027 WNEW.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Enough with the ouch. 
[00:00:30]  I love ouch.  Ouch.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  It's the O&H Show.  Hey.  Hey.  Today's the official kickoff to Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yeah.  Really happy with my last boobs.  We hope you guys got your wow signs ready for the ride home today.  I already driving in saw a bunch of wows on the backs of trucks.  Huge support from the truckers. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah.  And we gave out at least 1,500 to 1,700 brand new wow stickers outside the studio yesterday,  Anthony.  Now, a lot of those stickers are just plastered all over the neighborhood.  I like it.  All over the neighborhood.  I don't care where they turn up.  No, we don't care at all.  We got like 170,000 we have to give out.  So, and of course, the newest addition to the wow family, the van. 
[00:01:30]  The wow van.  Oh, my God.  We went down to the garage and checked it out.  We just got the wow van, the NEW wow van.  Oh.  Boy, if you don't get wowed in this thing, who's going to be driving that around?  Black Earl will be driving around the wow van today.  He's going to give out another, you know, a few hundred brand new wow stickers.  Eventually, they'll be all over the tri-state area.  Yes.  We got a couple of huge announcements to make about that next week, I believe.  So, you'll be able to get your wow sticker. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I'm encouraging a lot of the people that listen to us that are a little further away, especially,  just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we will send you a wow sticker back.  I'm hoping this thing can get into a regular envelope, though.  What do you think?  It's going to be close, huh?  No, I think so.  It'll make it?  Yeah.  All right.  Self-addressed stamped envelope.  Bless you, Anthony.  Thank you.  Just put WNEW wow sticker, and then send it in to 888 7th Avenue.  New York, New York, 10106, 10th floor, 10th floor, 10th floor is important as well. 
[00:02:30]  I think that address is on the WNEW website.  It's on the foundrymusic.com website.  Yes.  So, very exciting.  Mm-hmm.  Today's the day, Anthony.  It's not the greatest Whippamount Wednesday weather, but we've got to start somewhere.  Yeah.  And we start here.  As the weather gets warmer and we get closer to summer, this thing is going to be absolutely huge all over the place.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, very excited to bring back Whippamount Wednesday, finally.  Yes.  He said 10th floor. 
[00:03:00]  He's like Rain Man over there.  Jesus.  10th floor.  Yeah, 10th floor.  And, yes, a very happy birthday to Anthony.  Hey, thank you, Opie.  Let's get this out of the way.  Elizabeth.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Anthony.  Yes.  You getting closer to that big 4-0?  How did you know it was my birthday?  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  I guess I've been paying attention for two years.  I guess so.  Nice.  Well, thank you.  Did you have a good time last night?  Oh, my God.  I felt like crap this morning.  I know the feeling. 
[00:03:30]  A lot of, uh, a lot of beers I was drinking there last night.  Mm-hmm.  A privilege.  We went down there, had a little party for, uh, some of the listeners that were, uh, smart enough to get there early.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, oh, my God.  Celebrating our ratings.  Thank you.  No.  Well, congratulations.  You guys deserve it.  You're the best.  What a time we had.  Thank you, Elizabeth.  Hey, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Your first, uh, happy birthday today, Anthony.  Thank you.  A lot of lap dances last night.  Um, things got, it's getting out of hand. 
[00:04:00]  Whew.  Last night was the most surreal scene I've ever been a part of in my life.  Yeah.  That's all I have to say.  We're, we're, we're at privilege.  We're at privilege with a bunch of our listeners, the whole crew from the show.  Um.  And naked chicks.  Naked chicks.  And yesterday, an hour before, we're going to head down to a strip club.  The studio door opens, and it's my girlfriend, Sandy, and Rick's wife, Linda.  Yep.  I'm like, oh, this is going to suck. 
[00:04:30]  I'm not going to lie.  I'm not going to lie, right?  Hope's thinking, oh, now I'm not going to be able to have fun at the strip club.  Right.  Not that, uh, he does anything at the strip clubs that would get him in trouble,  but it's kind of like, uh, you know, you feel a little inhibited.  Oh, without a doubt.  When the girls come over to you, people are buying their lap dances.  My honesty gets me in trouble all the time, but I see her walk through the door, I'm like,  oh, great.  This, uh, that's great.  Let's go to the strip club with the girlfriend.  And they also brought some champagne when they first came in. 
[00:05:00]  And cake and everything, which was very, very nice.  Let me tell you something.  I think if my girlfriend had one more glass of champagne, she was going to be on that stage  last night.  There was a scene going on to my left that I thought I would never see in my lifetime.  On the couch was Sandy, who's Rick's sister, Rick's wife, Linda, on this couch, with two  of the hottest strippers that Privilege has to offer, giving them the sickest lap dance 
[00:05:30]  I've ever seen in my life.  And it wasn't the only lap dance they had.  They had more lap dances than you and I, Rick.  The bouncers had to come and break it up because it was getting too hot.  Oh, that's the truth, actually.  Yeah, one girl was going wild and the bouncer came over and said, okay, relax a little bit  over here.  Unbelievable.  What a display.  It was good to find out that my girlfriend likes big boobs just like me. 
[00:06:00]  You have something in common there.  We have something in common.  She was so hammered.  She's yelling to anyone that'll listen to her that she wants the biggest breasted stripper  to come over and give her a lap dance.  Yeah.  And she did.  So that was just really weird.  And then she was so liquored up.  Ben, I decided to stay in the hotel last night.  Yeah.  Ben comes up to me.  I just have a place around the station that I go to that's like, you know, mediocre,  no big deal.  It's just for crashing. 
[00:06:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Ben goes, man, she's really liquored up and having a great time.  You should go all out tonight.  Get a real nice hotel for her.  The St. Regis.  Yeah, the St. Regis.  So I go to Ben, Ben, you don't know what's going on, you idiot.  Because she was beyond that point of fun.  She was so hammered that I just knew she was going to crash, you know, any hour.  Yeah.  So why spend the, you know, like, like spaz, $700 for a hotel room when I know she's going  to crash and burn really fast? 
[00:07:00]  And needless to say, as soon as we got back to the station, oh, she crashed and burned.  And she was out cold as soon as I put the key in the door to the hotel room.  So, yeah, I made the right decision that I could stay in with the mediocre hotel.  Oh, so no action last night because of the drink?  I thought maybe from the way things were going in the club, there'd be some action.  I thought I was going to be inviting some strippers back to the hotel room with me and  my girlfriend. 
[00:07:30]  It was getting that crazy.  But no, Anthony, no.  She was out cold as soon as she hit the room there.  It's pretty funny because in the past, there had been a few issues about Opie and his hijinks  at the strip clubs.  Not that you do anything, but there's always this impression that the girls get when you  go to a strip club that something's going to be going on that just doesn't go on.  Wait, back up.  I think it's, I think there's the impression that girls in general get.  Right.  I don't think it's just me.  Now, the rules at the strip club are no touching. 
[00:08:00]  So when the lap dance is going on, you sit there like you're getting the electric chair.  Right.  You're strapped in and the girl just wriggles around in front of you and it's done.  Now, the girls.  It's that famous game when you're a kid that you play with your sister in the back seat.  The famous, I'm not touching you.  I'm not touching you.  Look, I'm not touching you.  Now, the girls, when they're getting a lap dance, for some reason, the touching's allowed  and it's fine.  Yeah, what was that about?  So they're grabbing boobage and ass, leg. 
[00:08:30]  Now, this is something that Sandy was doing that, I mean, if Opie would have done this  at a strip club, it would have been all over.  Oh, without a doubt.  Game over, man.  Without a doubt.  Arms broken.  But Sandy seemed to have been enjoying herself in the company of these same strippers that  she had once shunned.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  Not only that, dude.  It's like making plans.  Let's go shopping.  Yeah, shopping.  That's not what...  I'm going to bring home the big-breasted one.  That's not the type of plans I want her to make. 
[00:09:00]  Shopping plans.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Bill, what's going on?  Bill.  What's up?  Hey, yo.  Yeah.  I was just wondering, isn't it weird for Rick, aren't you dating his sister, that he's  going out, that she's into girls in a strip club, and that's her brother sitting there?  Rick and I were looking at each other.  It was weird on so many levels, it wasn't even funny.  It was not so many levels.  It was.  It was just, it was beyond bizarre.  It was like being weird.  That's a really weird scene going on.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:09:30]  Basically, my girlfriend was a lesbian for a day on the couch.  Yeah.  Basically, because I'll tell you something.  She did just as much as a lot of the girls do when they come in here to be lesbian for  a day.  And she had, I don't know, a hundred guys easily watching.  Easily.  How punked were you, Art?  I was pretty psyched for a while, but then I knew the crash and burn was coming, so.  The crash and burn, yeah.  All right.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  And we're stupid about that, too, you know, us guys. 
[00:10:00]  Why?  Well, you get your woman to that level where she's really, really letting loose and having  a good time.  And all you need to do is start getting her water or something at that point.  Keep her on that level.  But no, you get stupid in your mind.  You're like, no, keep feeding her the champagne.  It could get better.  Over the falls is what it's called.  Over the falls.  Right.  You ever see the river, like, miles away from Niagara Falls?  It's very nice.  Very nice.  It's calm.  Cool.  Once you're in that river, you're being brought along.  Yes. 
[00:10:30]  By the time the water really starts moving fast, it's too late.  There's no pulling them out of it.  Right.  And before you know it, you're right over the edge.  Right over the edge.  Crash and burn.  And the barrel is smashed, and you've got a headache.  Against the rocks.  Everyone feels like crap.  Yeah.  Well, a bunch of people checking in from Privilege last night.  Lou, what's up?  Yo, guys, how you doing, man?  Great, Lou.  Great party last night.  I enjoyed myself thoroughly.  Yeah, that was a pisser.  Oh, man, what you guys had going on up there on the stage by you? 
[00:11:00]  Unbelievable.  Your girlfriend is wild, though.  You really got to try to get her with a couple of chicks.  Hands down.  Hands down.  A lot of stuff was going on last night.  I had a great time.  You guys are a blast.  You make my day go really well.  Ah, cool, man.  And I appreciate everything you guys have done.  Thanks for the beer.  You're welcome, Lou.  You guys take care.  You know, your dedication whenever you guys get around to it, all right?  All right, man.  Take care.  Thanks.  Yeah, we got to thank Privilege, 23rd Street and 11th Avenue on the corner there.  They really hooked us up. 
[00:11:30]  They hooked our listeners up.  And we really, really appreciate it.  Great time.  And everyone behaved last night, too.  That was the first time I was there.  That was the first time?  Yeah.  I hadn't been down there.  Very impressed with the place.  Yeah.  Really nice.  I liked the whole area, because for a while I left the area where you guys were and went  down by the stage area.  Yeah.  Comfy chairs.  And you're just sitting there and watching the girl on stage dance.  It's a nice, it's a smaller place, which I like, too.  It has this lounge feel.  Yep.  Doesn't it?  Absolutely. 
[00:12:00]  Had a lot of fun down there.  Want to see some boobage?  And classy.  No pull to be had.  Yeah.  And you guys, man.  Oh, my God.  Got to thank Ben.  He made sure Stinky was running over to me every two seconds with a beer.  You know something?  Ben is just like me when it comes to our beer.  When we're out, we want beer.  Yeah.  And if there's ever a moment where we do not have a beer in our hand, we are cranky.  So, Ben knows. 
[00:12:30]  He instructs the interns, just keep the beers coming to Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  It was a good time.  Let's go to Ann.  She has a question for Rick.  Ann, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Ann.  Thank you.  I'm sure when all this lap dancing was going on last night that, oh, you were turned on,  Ann, you were turned on.  I want to know if Rick was turned on.  Well, because his wife was getting some action, too.  Right.  I don't think his wife was enjoying it as much as his sister.  Oh, she had fun.  She did?  She did, yeah.  Okay. 
[00:13:00]  Because Sandy was just forgetting about it.  Because that's kind of a weird dynamic going on.  I mean...  Tell me about it.  I felt like I was dead, but hovering over my body, watching everything happen.  That has to be a bizarre experience.  Right.  So, you're numb, but you don't feel anything, but you're just looking down like, huh.  And you can't do anything about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you're out of your body.  Yeah.  That's what it was like.  Yeah.  That's a good way to look at it.  I'm glad you guys had fun.  Yeah.  Cool.  Bye-bye.  All right.  And then Spaz's face when Erica was getting the lap dance.  Why were all the girls getting the lap dances? 
[00:13:30]  That's like the cool thing to do.  Who decided that, though?  All the girls got...  Well, everyone else was getting it.  Didn't you get one?  I got...  Honestly, I got one lap dance all night.  Yeah.  Oh, also, I was getting the lap dance, and Psycho Mark sits down right next to me.  Dude, you...  First of all, let me stop you.  You had so many women around you at one point.  I thought you were like the guy at the beach with the bread and the seagulls.  You threw a little bread up in the air, and they attacked the seagulls.  Because we didn't even see you for like... 
[00:14:00]  You came up for air like a half hour later.  Well, one girl asked me, which one is Anthony?  Right.  And I started pointing to Ben.  And the girl goes over to Ben, and Ben's like, what?  What?  She goes, oh, you're Anthony.  And Ben goes, no, that's Anthony, and points to Stinky.  And we have this girl going around.  And then, once again, Psycho Mark, I got to say, was convinced one of the girls are going home with him.  He does this every time at a strip club.  I don't want it, idiot. 
[00:14:30]  So at the end of the night, he's lounging on the couch with this stripper next to him,  and just like rapping with her and stuff.  And he's totally out of money.  She's not dancing for him anymore.  He's just like fighting her ear off.  I got no money.  Where's the funny money?  All right, listen.  Let's take a quick break.  We'll get into part two of our little party discussion.  What a blast.  We'll get Psycho Mark in here.  I think we're going to rename Stinky today as well.  The renaming of Stinky?  And also, it's Anthony's birthday. 
[00:15:00]  Thank you, Opie.  We're not going to lie and make believe nothing's going on.  There's some surprises for Anthony today.  Some good surprises.  Oh, boy.  You know how I love surprises.  Some good surprises.  Well, that's a good surprise.  There's your first surprise coming through the door.  Look at that.  Joey.  On cue.  Joey from Paisano on Mulberry Street.  Thank you.  Oh, big case of Chimay.  Very nice.  That's good.  I haven't seen Chimay since, well, since the episode.  I lost custody of all my bottles of Chimay that you had previously given me, Joey. 
[00:15:30]  Remember that?  All the cases you had given me?  They were in the little refrigerator?  I don't know where that is anymore.  I don't know.  I think I saw some homeless guy walking down the street of Huntington, drinking a bottle  of Chimay, wearing an FM Talk at 1027 t-shirt from the old station name, wearing sneakers  that look familiar, and my pants.  And that person was Ziggy.  Riding my mountain bike. 
[00:16:00]  Riding your mountain bike.  Very good.  Well, Joey, thank you, man.  You're welcome.  Joey, why didn't you join us last night?  You missed a scene, pal.  Joey was busy preparing the pasta lunch specials for today, which are just wonderful.  How are those going for you, Joey?  They're going excellent.  Very good.  People realized we were open during the day.  You didn't know that.  We apologize.  It took us a year to figure that out.  Well, how are we supposed to know you're open for those wonderful pasta lunch specials 
[00:16:30]  when we just come staggering in with a crowd of people at, like, 10 o'clock at night?  It's just true.  It's just true.  You're not awake during those lunch.  No.  No.  All right.  Well, I can just imagine what Rick and Opie have in store for me today.  You know how I love surprises.  And I'll tell you one thing.  And just like my birthday celebration last year.  Yeah.  Where you said, look, I had nothing to do with this.  Yeah.  I had nothing to do with this one today.  Okay.  Let me just tell you something. 
[00:17:00]  I did give Rick some advice, though, because I know you.  You know me.  What was the advice you gave Rick?  Good advice.  Was it that Anthony doesn't like to be touched?  Yes.  That's a good one.  I don't want...  I told him...  I'll be honest with you.  I told him that we might have to tame the festivities a little bit.  I don't like, like, when if a big fat Mendy comes in and rushes me to put her boobs in my face.  I swear to God someone's getting hit.  That's all I got to say.  I will just say this, Anthony.  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say, you know what? 
[00:17:30]  I had a pretty good time today.  You're not going to be uncomfortable.  See, because that's what it is.  I'm serious.  I don't like sitting here.  You're not going to have girls running at you with handcuffs like last year.  Yeah, just like you, I don't like sitting in this seat being uncomfortable.  Right.  Nor do you.  Last year, I had, like, smelly hookers trying to touch my junk.  I want to touch it.  Take it down.  Let me see.  I want to touch it.  Come on, papi.  Come on, papi.  Take your pants off.  I want to touch it.  That's exactly what was said last year on my birthday. 
[00:18:00]  So I know how it is, Anthony.  And Spike trying to handcuff me last year.  And Mendy, like, trying to put her big ass in my lap.  I'm like, that's not fun.  I think by the end of the day, you'll be very happy.  How's that?  Okay.  You'll say, hey, man, that was a pretty good little celebration for my little birthday.  Hopefully, when What Can We Learn Today comes on the show, we will learn that Anthony had a good time.  Yeah, we got some people calling in.  Good.  Good. 
[00:18:30]  Definitely some people showing up.  Some nice surprises.  No legal documents to serve me?  Not today.  Good, good.  That's always fun.  That's good.  That's a plus.  You don't want that on your birthday?  No.  No.  So we do have some surprises.  Joey's the first surprise with the Sharmay.  Joey, a pleasant surprise.  So far, we are batting a thousand.  Batting a thousand, right?  With your name on it.  Fried ravioli?  A whole tray.  A whole tray of fried ravioli out there waiting for you, Anthony.  Okay?  As long as people don't start picking at it and double dipping in the sauce, because then 
[00:19:00]  I'll get better.  See?  I'm cranky.  It's my goddamn day.  I don't want anyone double dipping.  They take the fried ravioli.  I take a bite.  And then dip it back in the goddamn sauce.  Well, this is kind of a closed little...  If Joey wanted people's saliva in his sauce, he would add it there at Paisano.  But he doesn't.  It's a closed party, too.  You ungrateful...  It's a what?  Pretty much a closed party.  Just a few people have been invited.  We don't want, you know, this place turning into a zoo.  Okay.  Very good. 
[00:19:30]  Ungrateful.  In other words, no hanger-ons today.  No hanger-ons today, Anthony.  Well, Steve's here.  Steve's here.  I didn't mean that as hanger-ons.  See?  You guys laughing made that...  What I was going to say is, well, Steve's here, and he's usually here when things are  things happen to videotape it, so that worried me right from the start.  Steve from the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Thank you, Steve.  No, we went over his status.  He's not a hanger-on.  Steve is totally not a hanger-on.  This man contributes more to the show than a lot of people, than I think anybody besides 
[00:20:00]  Opie and I.  He's a connection.  He's connected to the show.  Absolutely.  I mean, the unofficial website's un-freaking-believable.  Yeah.  I'm touched.  Foundrymusic.com.  You know, if it wasn't for Steve, I wouldn't be chained to the computer playing Soldier  of Fortune.  That was true.  I saw the link on the website, clicked on it, and now I can't even...  I thought I was done with it. 
[00:20:30]  Really?  The other day.  I'm battling it out in the back of that C-130 cargo plane.  Oh, really?  And I thought I had to get through that, and it was over.  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  I'm back on.  And I'm playing in the mode where it's like, you don't have a rat's chance in hell of getting  through it.  That's the level I'm playing in.  I put the most difficult.  I play on total jerk-off mode.  It's retarded.  There's no medipack things.  There's no ammo.  I'm running around charging guys with machine guns with a knife.  I'm coming around a corner. 
[00:21:00]  It's like, I got my knife, and I can throw it, too, as I just get riddled.  Well, I was going to send you the cheat codes, but I know you don't like that.  I definitely don't like the cheat codes, yeah.  Because I like to run these games.  Immortal, running through walls.  God mode, yeah.  Running through walls, flying mode.  You're like flying around, impervious, killing people with unlimited ammo.  Exactly.  Jeez, I got ten minutes.  Let me finish this game.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I zip through the floor, take out everybody in the room. 
[00:21:30]  You could just dip down through the floor and throw grenades at people.  Exactly.  That's funny.  I've got the RPG.  I set it to fire seven rockets at a time when it runs out.  I'm like Steve.  That's how I finish my games, too.  Screw it.  You know what, though?  It takes away from the pleasure of, first of all, Soldier of Fortune, the game,  I love the sniper rifle.  My favorite.  I will use it when it's totally inappropriate.  There's like 20 people in a room.  I can wipe them out one grenade.  I'm like, one at a time, baby.  One at a time. 
[00:22:00]  Zoom in.  Neck shots.  Did you do the neck shots with a full zoom on the sniper rifle?  Oh, yes.  You hit these guys in the neck.  It pumps out.  They grab their neck and go, oh, and slowly collapse.  You might even have time to pump another round or two on the way down.  It is the most vile game I've ever played.  Have you found out that you can go after the guys that have the fuel packs in their back?  Yeah, yeah.  They've got flamethrowers.  If you pick off the tank on the back, they explode in flames, running around going, ah! 
[00:22:30]  Ah!  And as they're running, you can shoot them again.  Yeah, you blow into them.  Boom, boom.  Oh, what a game.  Thank you, Steve.  Because like I said, I wouldn't have found that if it wasn't for your lint.  And Steve brought you a birthday gift, too.  Are you going to thank him for it?  Oh, the one we were watching inside earlier?  Yes.  Thank you, Steve.  You're quite welcome.  I have never received a German fisting video in all of my years, all my birthdays.  I could look back and honestly say, that gift is original. 
[00:23:00]  And we were viewing some of it in the office before the show.  Boy, were we.  Oh, my God.  It was just like, ya, oh, ya, ya, ya!  Yeah, the language was more disturbing than anything.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you're trying to decipher what they're actually saying as this violin.  Like it matters.  I mean, the guy's looking for his watch.  I think it was a little over the top when the guy tried to clap.  I mean, come on.  Enough's enough.  What is it called?  Fistler's Bunker or something like that? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, right.  So there you go.  You've gotten two gifts so far, Anthony.  Yeah.  You've gotten the case of Shemay from Joey from Paisano and a fisting video from Steve from  downtownmusic.com.  So, so far, batting a thousand.  I am happy.  You're right.  All right.  We have the dancer on the line from Privilege that didn't know who you were last night.  Oh, no.  Chippy.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Oh, you are bad. 
[00:24:00]  Are you making fun of me?  Yeah.  Are you the Fran Drescher girl?  Yeah.  But don't say my real name if you remember it.  No.  I'm going to go by Chippy today.  Chippy like I remember.  I know.  Oh, by the way, happy birthday, Anthony.  Thank you.  Now I know who is your wise guys, you little bunch of wise asses.  So, anyway, what was I going to say?  Oh, and you two were funny.  Well, actually more Opie.  Opie looked so surprised when my girlfriend and I were dancing for his girlfriend.  Instead of looking happy, he looked so shocked. 
[00:24:30]  We were like, like he was scared or something.  No, Chippy, trust me, I was very happy, but I was very, very surprised you were able to do that.  Remember what I told you, jealousy is an evil thing, but I was just joking with you.  That's all right.  Well, have a happy birthday, and it was nice to meet you guys and all that good stuff.  Were you turned on by my girlfriend?  Yeah, she was a little cutie pie.  We even exchanged numbers and addresses, and we're going to go out dancing, not shopping, dancing.  Dancing.  Dancing.  Dancing.  So, definitely tell her to give me a call. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  So, you guys have fun.  All right, Chippy.  Thank you.  Nice meeting you.  Bye-bye.  There you go.  Great.  Somehow she doesn't sound as, what's the word I'm looking for?  Sexy.  No.  Hot.  No.  No.  Oh, intoxicated.  That's last night.  Let's talk to Jay. 
[00:25:30]  Jay, what's going on?  Not much, man.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Thank you.  Awesome party last night.  Yeah, that was fun, huh?  What the heck is with Spaz's dance, man?  That's what he did out there in the city?  Oh, Spaz got up in front of the crowd and did his little dance.  Right on the stage.  Oh, God.  You should have had him do a little encore before he left.  Yeah.  Even if he scrammed out of there too quick.  Well, that's okay.  I had a room at the same region.  I've got to say, I don't know who I'm going to pee off more here, Rick or Opie, but man,  your girlfriend's pretty hot there, Opie.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:26:00]  That was the highlight of the day, just kind of taking a peek over there and taking a  dance all night.  Yeah, I know.  She did lesbian for a day pretty much for me.  That was awesome, guys.  What's up, God?  That was great.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Take care.  Bye.  Yeah, that was the biggest part of the show up on that little stage area last night.  That was just everybody gawking at Sandy and one of the girls.  You guys don't even know, man.  When Ant and I worked in Boston, we went to...  Did you go at that time?  Or you heard the story, though?  Yeah, I didn't know.  The whole station went to a strip club after this gig, and they talked Sandy into going, 
[00:26:30]  and I'm like, oh, this is just such a bad idea.  Oh, boy.  I lasted a total of 30 seconds in the place.  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Not exaggerating.  Wherever I looked, there was naked women, and that was not cool in her eyes.  Yeah.  And we left within 30 seconds.  So last night, to go completely the other way and do pretty much lesbian for a day on  a couch is an amazing turnaround. 
[00:27:00]  Wunderbar.  All right, Ant.  We should take a break.  Okay.  Is that the post photographer?  Post photographer's here.  You guys are going to see a great picture of Ant and I tomorrow on the post.  All hungover.  All hungover and stuff.  I told them not to come today, but I guess people don't listen.  Oh, well.  All right.  All right, Ant.  Let's take a break, okay?  Are they doing a little ditty on us there on the post tomorrow?  That's right here.  Rumor has it Minnelli's going to...  What did we do wrong?  Maybe have some kind words for us. 
[00:27:30]  It's impossible.  Come on.  There's no way.  Any time we're in the paper, it's for something bad.  Even the Daily News downplayed what we did in the ratings.  The last thing that was in the paper with our pictures, it's still like on my dresser.  Dopey duo, they were calling us.  Yeah, that was a dopey duo.  That was the last headline we got in the paper.  It was the post, and it was John Minnelli's column.  So I don't know why we're allowing his guy to take pictures of us today. 
[00:28:00]  Now, you will hear the argument from John, and I think it is an honest argument that he doesn't write the headline to these things.  Right.  But don't they have a say in what they write?  Just because it's an Opie and Anthony story, do you have to fit the word dopey in there somehow?  Dopey duo?  The original, too.  Oh, I never heard that one.  I know.  Oh, dopey.  Oh.  The best one we hear is dopey and ain't funny.  Yeah, it's dopey and ain't funny. 
[00:28:30]  See, that's a play on Anthony, Dave.  Ain't funny.  My favorite, though, in Boston, they used to call us the toxic twins.  I didn't mind that one.  We liked that one.  That was like we took the title from Aerosmith.  I know.  It used to be Tyler and Perry's name.  Yeah, and they're from Boston, too.  So we were quite flattered with the toxic twins.  Yeah.  All right.  Tom wants to get on the air real fast here.  Tom, what's up?  Yeah, you guys do.  All right, Tom.  Yeah, well, me and a bunch of my friends were out on Channel 4 with Wow Signs this morning. 
[00:29:00]  Were you guys, you were the guys outside the Today Show?  Yeah.  I heard there were a ton of Wow Signs up by Al Roker as he's letting some retarded kid in a wheelchair do the weather.  Yeah, they threw us out.  Oh, why?  Some guy came over, he was really pissed, and he said, no W-O-W signs.  Did they get it on camera?  Oh, we got plenty on camera.  They've handled these five times.  We had, okay, terrific, how'd you like to mow my lawn, a whole bunch of signs.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  Huh?  Yeah, I had the heart at the end, too.  I was reading some email before the show, and yeah, supposedly Al Roker's letting, like, this kid in a wheelchair do the weather. 
[00:29:30]  Timmy!  Timmy!  Timmy!  And the weather on the East Coast?  Timmy!  And these freaks were behind him with all the signs.  Every time there was this bit of silence, I screamed, sushi!  Well, thanks for helping us out, man.  Whip Him Out Wednesday debuts today, finally.  Yeah.  When are the trucks coming out with the stickers?  We want some stickers.  Black Girl, if he can figure out, you know, how to get to the van, we'll be out. 
[00:30:00]  Is he out there yet?  Yeah.  He's out there?  All right.  We're right by the studio, so...  Do we have any stickers upstairs?  That's all I'm going to ask.  We probably have maybe a few.  Probably a few left.  All right.  We don't have many, so...  I mean, if you're close to the studio, you can come by, but I'm not...  I mean, everyone else, stay away.  Stay away.  We just don't...  We don't have any stickers until tomorrow, really.  The rest are in the van, and we have maybe 10 or 12 upstairs at the receptionist.  All right, Tom?  Okay. 
[00:30:30]  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Syndication, I miss.  Oh, you're freaking smart answers.  I love it.  All right.  This was just handed to me.  Black Earl is heading to many locations all over Manhattan, Anthony, with the brand-new  WOW stickers.  Yeah.  In the new WOW van.  In the new WOW van, and hopefully he'll be calling in.  That might even be him calling right now.  We have to take a break, but let's see if it's Earl.  Earl?  Hello.  I know. 
[00:31:00]  Spaz is screening the hotline.  Yes, but hello.  He's typing Earl.  In the van.  Spaz is typing Earl.  Earl.  Calling in.  We know you, Texas.  What a nod.  What an idiot.  Earl.  No, this is Stinky now.  Hey, Stinky, what's up?  What's up?  How are you, bud?  Let me put it back on hold and type, Stinky, calling in.  All right.  Stinky's in the van with Black Earl.  Where are you guys?  We are on 16th Street. 
[00:31:30]  We're right about to go down park.  Are you guys going to Washington Square?  Yeah.  You sure?  Oh, my God.  Is that where Washington Square is, Ben?  That's, uh...  I know.  No, we're not there yet.  Further down.  All right.  So the first...  Oh, my God.  This is going to be...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  All right.  So you and Earl are heading toward Washington Square Park?  Yes.  All right.  And you're going to give out the WOW stickers out there for a little while, right?  I hope so.  Stinky, how long do you think it'll take to get there?  Ask Earl. 
[00:32:00]  Earl, how long do you think it'll take to get there?  Five more minutes.  All right.  Earl, same.  If you want to be one of the first people to have this brand new WOW sticker, go to Washington  Square Park, look for the WOW van, Black Earl, Black Earl, and Stinky will be on hand.  By the way, we're going to rename Stinky today, too.  Yeah.  The renaming of Stinky.  Stinky, we're going to rename you today.  Cool.  He's earned it.  After you get rid of all these WOW stickers, come back to the station, and we're going to  rename you.  All right.  Can't wait. 
[00:32:30]  All right.  Cool.  There you go.  Stinky and Black Earl with WOW stickers.  They'll be in front of Washington Square Park within five minutes, Anthony.  You won't be able to miss the brand new WNAW WOW van.  All right.  Opie and Anthony WOW van.  Very impressed with that, Opie.  Yeah.  When we went down to the garage.  They actually spelt our names right.  They put our names on the side of the van.  We're flattered.  Thank you.  Now, where's our syndication, you bastards?  Well, we start with names on the van that go from there. 
[00:33:00]  You're lucky.  And believe me, we got paint remover.  Just in case you're smart asses think you're going to say something funny, I'll go out  the van myself and paint right over.  We don't care.  Slappy and Wappy van.  Whatever.  You'll be out the door.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  It's Anthony's birthday, everyone.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  Some days, you know, we're a lap ride, and other days we just flat out suck.  We know it.  Interesting.  It's true.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie, Opie. 
[00:33:30]  It's the Whip Em Out Wednesday kickoff today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Not the greatest day for wowing, but a lot of people getting their wow signs for their rides  for the ride home today.  We have over 170,000 brand new wow stickers that we're very proud of that are going to be  all over the tri-state area.  Under 70,000.  And if you want to be one of the first people with the wow sticker, you can go down to Washington  Square Park where our buddy Black Earl is as we speak, Anthony. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  Hey, Earl.  What's going on?  What's going on?  You made it to Washington Square, I see, huh?  Yeah, we're at McBealville in Washington Square West.  We were greeted by the cops and the New York One van.  Is that good or bad?  That's very good.  They asked for wow stickers.  All right.  Very good.  And Stinky's starting to hand some out already.  We got a nice little crowd here already.  Okay.  They were waiting for us and wow supplies last.  We got some wow stickers.  Very, very good.  How long are you guys staying at Washington Square Park before you move on to another location? 
[00:34:30]  We took his first batch run down and then we'll head up to another locale near you.  All right.  And, well, that'll be, what, about 15, 20 minutes?  Yep.  All right.  Earl, wake up.  I'm so tired.  You're the only one that wasn't drinking last night.  A privilege.  You should be more awake than we are.  Well, I went out after that.  I went to a rave last night.  You went to a rave?  Yes.  What were you, taking some X?  Yeah, really. 
[00:35:00]  Some X at the rave?  What are you doing, Earl?  I can't imagine Earl on X.  I just can't remember how I got home.  I was a party animal.  Unbelievable.  Earl, have you ever been a party animal?  No, not really.  Have you ever woke up thanking God that you woke up?  Yes, I have.  Yeah, right.  I'm serious.  Yes, I have.  All right, Earl.  So you're at Washington Square Park with the Brand New Wow stickers.  Yes, I mean, you know, and we are literally blocking traffic now.  Guys are coming out of the woodwork.  Taxi, taxi cabs, vans. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We're a little distracted.  They just want to pick up a little bit.  We're a little distracted.  We're getting our picture taken.  Yes.  It's picture day.  It's picture day.  It's picture day, like in school.  Yeah.  Remember that?  You'd get all dressed up, and you'd go in to get your picture taken, and they'd put the  little dicky on you?  Remember the little dicky?  You got the clip on tied?  Wow.  Yeah.  And actually posing to make those pictures.  Wait.  Give me one of those.  That's a good idea. 
[00:36:00]  Stinky Jonas.  Brand new Wow stickers.  No?  Yeah.  Yes, we're not paying attention to the show.  Sorry.  That our photo shoot is happening.  Yeah, we're going to be there for a while.  We're like supermodels.  And then we'll head back up.  All right.  Cool.  Cool.  Bye.  I'll talk to you later.  You got it.  I have no idea what Earl said.  I'm distracted.  I'm blinded by the photographer here.  Yeah.  All right.  I guess he's going to be handing out Wow stickers for another 15, 20 minutes at Washington  Square Park.  Okay?  Yeah.  Looking forward to getting your new Wow stickers. 
[00:36:30]  Do you need any more shots, sir?  Oh, they take a million of them open.  You know what that is?  Can you get both of us in on one shot?  No, that's impossible.  You want us to move over?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  We don't like posing.  We've never posed for a picture.  Yeah.  We just kind of let them roll.  All the radio shows that help me.  Ah!  All the radio shows help you?  Yeah.  All the radio shows.  Do they?  Yeah.  Really?  Like who?  Like who?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You can talk.  You can name whoever you like. 
[00:37:00]  When I go on Howard's show, he moves around.  Does he?  Well, he's a poser.  He's always trying to make himself look good and stuff.  We're not posers.  We don't care.  We're just regular guys.  He's laughing.  Okay.  I'll put the sunglasses on then and stand there.  Yeah.  We're going to get dumped out here.  I know.  You know how it is.  Be careful.  Hey, somebody else was talking though this morning.  That's what I heard.  Yeah.  Imus is still allowed to make fun of other people in the company. 
[00:37:30]  We're just not allowed to.  We can't though.  All right.  Oh, new lens?  Longer.  It's like a region.  A longer lens.  Why don't you just get closer?  It's that weird.  Dude, get that out of my face.  Yeah.  It's big and long and black, Opie.  Just like you like it.  Yeah.  You ass.  Yeah, right?  Sound bite.  Make sure you isolate that clip. 
[00:38:00]  Rosette.  Yes?  You just wowed?  I just wowed a La Bella Pizzeria.  Delivery man, actually.  You wowed a delivery man where?  Yeah.  On right on 41 Madison.  Oh, cool.  They come from La Bella Pizzeria.  So I just wanted to call to tell them I received their pizza.  It was delicious.  Wait, the delivery guy came to the door and you wowed him?  Yeah.  That's like, that's cool.  That's like great, isn't it?  Yes, thank you.  Oh, you're very welcome.  Enjoy your pizza.  I already did. 
[00:38:30]  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye, Rosette.  Wowings.  There you go.  Just put a wow on your vehicle somewhere.  You'll get wowed.  Yeah.  And Earl's at Washington Square Park handing out the wow stickers.  He wants me to look at the camera.  There you go.  Do something.  What do you want us to do?  Are we supposed to do something wacky?  I hate those pictures.  We don't like those, though.  All right.  Like, it's not us.  It's not you?  I don't know.  We're supposed to be like Scott and Todd and go in a dress or something. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, you want us to dress in drag?  That would be cool.  Hey.  That's not cool.  That's embarrassing.  Does that commercial just look awful?  Radio commercials, they're all over now because we're in the spring book.  Yeah.  That everyone really pays attention to.  Right.  And the commercials are just horrendous.  Scott and Todd in a dress.  And I hear this commercial campaign is used all over the country.  Yeah, it's not even original.  I mean, there's a Scott and Todd, you know, duo in every major city in America doing the  exact same commercial.  Like, you go to Denver, Colorado, and they're slappy and wappy in the same commercial. 
[00:39:30]  Same script.  Same dress.  And if you're going to do a commercial, if they're going to throw money behind you to  do a TV spot, wouldn't you want to be responsible for the writing and creative input?  I'd want to look cool.  Yeah.  Why not?  You're not going to find us in dresses.  They're going to dress.  You know what I want for our show?  I want Terry Garr.  I'd love those commercials.  It must work because that station went through the effing roof.  Terry Garr.  What does it say for the DJ, though? 
[00:40:00]  The DJ that's playing those boring, stupid songs?  Yeah.  And she just does a back sell.  It's called the back sell in the business.  The back sell.  That was Celine Dion.  Dionne Warwick before that.  And Chris Christopherson.  And the whole thing, the whole gist of the commercial is Terry Garr telling everybody how they don't  talk.  Right.  How, like, you will just hear the music and none of that chatter.  Right.  And the DJ is sitting right next to Terry Garr, like, smiling.  Yeah.  Saying, thank you, Terry.  Thank you for telling everybody and reiterating I'm a brainless buffoon who can just spin songs. 
[00:40:30]  That I'm a robot and anyone can do my job.  Thank you.  Hi, I'm Terry Garr for Light FM.  Yeah.  Listen, we could put a monkey behind the board to play your favorite songs.  And it's okay.  Listen to this F and C.  On Light FM.  I think you're making the post photographer laugh a little bit.  No, come on.  Don't shake.  No, maybe shake.  The fuzzier my pictures, the better.  Please. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, we're not supermodels.  It's going to be pretty sad tomorrow.  We're not supermodels to begin with and we're all hung over and stuff.  I didn't even shower today.  It's like the moon's got to be in the right position for me to get a good picture.  For God's sake.  All right.  Work with me.  Work it, Opie.  Work it.  Come on.  Show me.  Show me.  See, I'll do something stupid and that'll be the one they use in the paper.  I know.  That's why.  That's why I'm not trying not to do anything stupid.  That's why I'm not making any faces.  Usually I open my mouth wide and do something really stupid and then next thing I know it's 
[00:41:30]  in the paper and then all our sick listeners fax it to me with something in the vicinity  of my open mouth.  Thank you.  Quick, make a face.  Watch, watch.  Go, go.  I won't do it.  I won't do it.  I can't.  What do you think?  You got some good shots, you think?  Yeah.  We're going to get you guys together at one point.  Can you bring you any closer than this?  We don't come together.  No.  We hate each other.  Yeah.  That's like the honesty.  We sound like we're having fun on the air and stuff, but in real life we can't 
[00:42:00]  stand each other.  Oh, my God.  We know we need each other, but we just don't like each other.  It's like Martin and Lewis.  Right.  The old days and stuff.  We can't stand each other.  Yeah, so.  Ronan Martin.  What do you want us to do, Stan?  Can't they just use two separate pictures?  Yeah, that's always cool.  They do that, right?  Oh, thanks.  No?  You're not going to...  What are we going to...  Can't you just superimpose our heads on the Ilion Gonzalez picture?  That would be cool.  Is that like a photographer's effing wet dream? 
[00:42:30]  Like if you were in that room?  Come on with those pictures?  Jesus.  Look around, look around, look at the turn around.  He's like, oh, my God.  I get Opie and Anthony.  This guy got Ilion Gonzalez with a gun at his head.  I get Opie and Anthony.  I get the Opie and Anthony.  And they don't even freaking move for me.  They don't do anything.  They're not giving me any good couple of tools.  Why couldn't I be there when the little flaming kids are running down the...  Huh?  I can't even see you.  That's the always best.  That's the point.  Come on.  Well, I don't get... 
[00:43:00]  But this is where I broadcast from.  Yeah, you're not going to get like a fake picture.  This is...  Ant sits there.  I sit there.  Well, we need to see him.  Here, get up on that maybe.  No, I need to see him.  Stand up then.  Stand up.  He doesn't stand up.  Yeah, I don't stand.  It's his birthday.  Yeah, it's my birthday.  You're making me uncomfortable.  See, he's moving forward.  It doesn't look right.  There we go.  There, there's a picture for you.  Yeah, put that in the post.  Of course not. 
[00:43:30]  They only do that if somebody like, you know, Donald Trump does it to them.  Then they're like, oh, look, he's flipping a bird.  All right.  No, we...  I think they've used two separate pictures before.  They take the little square ones and they put them together.  It's your world.  You make it however you want.  That's right.  All right.  I'm almost done there.  Okay.  Ah, he's almost done.  All right.  We'll keep conversing.  Hmm.  What the hell were we just talking about?  Now I forgot.  Oh, yeah.  No, that wasn't it.  No.  All right.  Yeah, Ilya Gonzalez.  This guy has a photograph of us. 
[00:44:00]  What was, like, the most famous picture you ever took?  I don't want to talk about it.  Why?  Why?  Was it some kind of death picture?  No.  Yeah, actually it was.  Was it?  Like a subway victim or something?  You weren't the guy that took the picture of the fireman taking the kid out of the Oklahoma bombing thing, were you?  That was a good one, too.  That was good.  How long have you guys been here at this station?  We moved...  We were born and raised, but we've been back two years.  I know what picture it was. 
[00:44:30]  Harley Davidson.  The jumper?  No.  No?  You're close.  It was a jumper, though?  Yeah, it was a fall.  A fall.  A fall from the top of a building?  Within the last two years?  One time ago.  Long time ago?  Okay.  Yeah, right.  The sailor kissing the woman in Times Square after the big one.  Hey, Black Earl, what's up?  Hindenburg.  Hey, guys.  We got a minor problem.  What's the problem?  Remember the cop that was up with the rock? 
[00:45:00]  The cop that was up with the rock?  Yeah, remember when we had a couple of cops that came up when the rock came by?  Oh, sure.  Those big monster dudes, yeah.  Well, they're chasing stinky around in Washington Square Park.  Why?  They're like, where's your pen to me?  Where's your license?  They're rousing them?  They're rousing them.  That's pretty funny.  That is funny.  Is he running from the police?  He's like a chicken with his head cut off.  Stinky's running from the cops, man.  That's great.  He's used to that video. 
[00:45:30]  He's used to that, yeah.  We have him on video running from the cops.  Maybe we ought to incorporate that into his new name that we want to give him.  Well, I got a few ideas for the new stinky name.  What?  I want to call him either Scabby, Road Rash, Rash, something like that.  Rash?  Rash.  I don't know.  Well, Earl.  Yo.  When are you leaving Washington Square Park?  We're going to leave in a few minutes.  We've got a nice little car there.  We're kind of cropping things up our way up to Broadway. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  So you're leaving there very soon?  We're going to leave in about five or ten minutes or so and then head up to another locale.  All right.  If you're very close to Washington Square Park, look for Earl in the WOW van.  He's handing out the brand-new WOW stickers, okay?  Well, guys, I just found Stinky.  You found Stinky?  Yeah.  Is he in custody?  It just looks lush.  Good phone.  All right.  Thanks for the great phone, Earl.  Is it?  Oh, God, you're a nightmare.  Dude, are you heading toward Brian Park next? 
[00:46:30]  Did I say that out loud?  Oops.  Yes, we are.  Okay.  All right.  So why don't you leave Washington Square Park in the next five minutes?  And then everyone will see you at Brian Park, okay?  Photographer.  No one, Earl.  It'll take two hours, so.  Oh, stop it.  All right.  Photographer, Dave.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  There goes Earl.  He'll be at Brian Park next.  What's your name?  With the WOW stickers.  Dave.  Dave.  Was it Clapton's Kid?  Yeah.  Okay.  Boy, these people are smart on their instant feedback.  You had to take a picture of Clapton's Kid after he fell? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  I didn't know it at the time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What do you do?  I got a lot of heat.  I think it was from this station.  Really?  For taking it, yeah.  Oh, that was the old days.  Yeah.  How could anybody take a picture like that?  Scott's a...  Oh, God, Psycho Mark.  Yeah, but what do you do...  No, I didn't.  What do you do with a picture like that?  Because, I mean, you can't really put it in the regular papers.  They did.  Remember?  They ran...  I don't remember.  Remember?  It was the rooftop picture, and...  That was you?  Yeah.  Hey, nice, man.  Oh, so you were the guy from above, right? 
[00:47:30]  Right.  Looking down.  Okay.  And they printed it in the paper, and there was like a big flack for it.  Oh, so you do have a pretty famous picture.  That's cool.  Well, it's not cool.  Kind of sucky pictures.  You have to have.  Yeah, it's a very sad story, but wow.  Anything else we'd know?  Any of your other work?  That's about the one that stays with you guys.  Dead children, and now Opie and Anthony.  Very good.  Which one is more heinous?  All right.  Well, thanks, man.  Thank you very much.  If the post is listening, we weren't cooperative. 
[00:48:00]  Well, we were trying.  You know what it is?  It's hard to be cooperative, because as we do this, I'm going to sit where I sit, you sit where you sit.  We face each other, and that's the way it is.  We're just not posers.  We don't put dresses on.  It's just us.  Sorry.  Scott and Todd, listen to us.  Look, we're in dresses.  We look like Kel.  We're hungover.  I'm wearing the same clothes as yesterday.  Give me a great picture tomorrow in the paper. 
[00:48:30]  Or the hungover Opie and Anthony.  Great.  Yeah.  We'll have to have a contest.  What's more heinous to look at?  The picture of Eric Clapton's kid on the rooftop, or Opie and Anthony after a night out at Privilege?  All right, folks are going nuts.  Let's get back into the show.  Yeah.  Sorry for that distraction.  Yeah, we can play the wow song.  And it's Anthony's birthday.  We've got some nice surprises on the way for him, okay?  I can't wait.  We'll be back.  Whip him out Wednesday officially begins today.  Wow. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  We're for my Wednesday now.  We're for my Wednesday.  With them out.  It's come out.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now.  Come on, lady.  Come on in, open your blouse.  Open your blouse.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Flash your boobies and girls.  Show your balance to guys.  Show your balance to guys. 
[00:49:30]  It's going to hang below the dashboard.  Below the dashboard.  We'll lift those babies up high.  Lift those babies up high.  Ooh.  Wow.  Take on my baby now.  Take on my baby now.  And flap them around.  Flap them around.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now.  Come on, lady.  That's what wow is about. 
[00:50:00]  That's what wow is about.  You've got to lose that shirt.  Lose that shirt.  And let those fun bags bounce.  Fun bags bounce.  See those more.  For more sake.  For more sake.  Just let those jobs come out.  Let those jobs come out.  Woo-hoo.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Hey, I'm Jon Stewart.  And I listen to Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW. 
[00:50:30]  These guys have problems, but you know that.  I'm Opie and Anthony.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I'm just like one for a while.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Oh. 
[00:51:00]  Shut up.  Oh, Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Yeah, maybe that was cool like the first time he did it, but shut up.  I don't mind it.  I like hearing it.  Well, you like when the team wins, I'm sure, being a Yankee fan, Anthony,  but you don't need that jerk-off every time.  The Yankees win.  Right?  Maybe when they win the World Series, great, but okay, they beat the Twins 2-0 today.  Great.  I like the way you say when. 
[00:51:30]  Huh?  I like the way you use the word when.  Maybe when they win the World Series, you say that.  Sure.  I'll give that to you.  But when they're just playing the Twins at home, they win 2-0.  Do you need...  No!  Yankees win!  It's not helping my hangover.  Shut up!  He's the American equivalent of the...  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Yeah.  Wow, this guy's listening from California.  Or actually a girl.  Edith, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You're listening to us from Cali?  From California. 
[00:52:00]  You guys, I saw two wow signs and a, okay, terrific, this morning on NBC.  Oh, you saw that on the Today Show?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was our doing.  So what's going on?  Are you listening?  Nothing.  You're not listening to our show, are you?  Yeah, I listen to your show every day.  Where?  On Amp Radio.  Cool.  That's cool.  I just wanted to say what's up, and I love you guys, and you guys are awesome, and...  Listen to California voice and everything.  That's so cool.  Do you even know who we are?  Did you listen to us when you were in New York, or you just discovered us on the Internet? 
[00:52:30]  What's up?  I did.  I just accidentally clicked on a button, and here come some goofy guys.  Oh, you rock.  How long ago?  How long?  Like two weeks ago.  Oh, right on.  You're a rule.  Yeah, so anybody that's out there, whoever wants to listen to Opie and Anthony, if I can't  get them, you can get them on the Internet.  Do you got blonde hair?  You look like a Barbie doll?  No, I have brown hair.  Oh, I'm just kind of...  Are you hot?  For the whole California.  I'm hot, dude.  Can you take a picture, dude? 
[00:53:00]  I want to send you some pictures, but I asked one time, and they just clung up on me.  Oh, really?  I want to find out your email address.  Well, first of all, have you checked out our unofficial website?  I instant feedback you guys all the time.  No, I'm talking foundrymusic.com?  Oh, no, I haven't done that yet.  It's our underground website.  There's some great stuff on there, and we would love to put your picture, our first California  listener.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  You got a pen.  I'll give you the website. 
[00:53:30]  All right.  What part of California are you living?  In L.A.  Well, actually, in Orange County.  For what part?  Near Belinda.  Okay.  Nice.  Well, Anthony, I spent some time out there.  Yes, I was out there.  You wouldn't be Dreamweaver, would you?  No.  All right, the website's foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com.  One word, foundrymusic.com.  If you're a fan of the show, you're going to love that website.  The new battle cry, syndication illegally. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah, they can't stop us.  Know how many people are spreading the word now?  I heard people from Phoenix yesterday checking in, enjoying the show.  I'd like to welcome our listeners in Phoenix, Arizona, for the O.P. and Anthony show, and  now Los Angeles, California.  The email floods in from all over the country.  Isn't that great?  It's unbelievable.  Your ratings are going up, dude.  Congratulations.  Hey, Dave.  Thanks, Edith.  Man, I could talk to you all day.  I love that accent. 
[00:54:30]  That is so cool.  There's nothing like the California girl accent.  Yeah, we have really bad accents on the East Coast here, so.  With your cause.  Yeah, that's funny.  You wash.  Yeah.  Wash your hands.  Hey, hey, what's the little animal that collects nuts during the winter and climbs  trees?  A squirrel.  Squirrel.  Squirrel.  Squirrel.  Squirrel.  Squirrel.  That little bit.  Squirrel.  What do you, what, what, what comes out of the faucet at home? 
[00:55:00]  Water.  Water.  Water.  I like it.  Water.  All right.  Well, Edith.  Yes.  Please call us from time to time.  Oh, I will.  I definitely will.  If you want a sticker, just send a self-addressed stamped envelope, and we'll send some out to  you immediately.  Okay.  I want to say, I don't.  Actually, screw that.  I'm going to put you on hold.  We're going to get your address, and we'll mail out some stuff immediately to you.  Awesome.  All right?  Yes.  Hold on a line.  All right, Edith.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Look at that. 
[00:55:30]  From California, Los Angeles, California, our affiliate out there in California.  They are bootlegging our show like crazy on the internet.  They can't stop us.  Syndication trying to stop it.  That's right.  Syndication illegally.  God damn you, boy.  Damn you.  You're always undermining my plan.  You can't stop the internet.  It's crazy, boy.  Hey, Ben, get Edith's address and send her some cool stuff. 
[00:56:00]  She's our California listener.  I'm like Boss Hogg, and you're like them Duke boys.  Every week I try to do something to screw you over, and by the end, General Lee is just  effing me up, jumping over crap, screwing up my general plans.  It's funny because the lawyers can't keep up with it either because they're, like, shutting  down, like, websites every day, and new ones are popping up, you know, carrying the  show.  Syndication whenever.  Syndication illegally.  I love it.  All right.  It's Anthony's birthday. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Another surprise.  Oh, Jesus.  I like the present I got from Joey, actually.  All right.  What?  All the food.  Yeah.  And did you see his new menu?  That'll be debuting when?  Next week.  Next week at Paisano.  Opie, I am proud to say that you could go to Paisano, open up the menu, and look at  the appetizers, and you will see where it used to say fried ravioli.  Uh-huh.  Now it's Anthony's fried ravioli.  Oh, look at that, huh?  Yes. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  And then at the bottom here, I also see Opie's Eggplant Parmesan.  Not bad.  Look at that.  You know, you bring up something pretty funny, because I was in a deli.  I think it was on Park Ave in Huntington.  Oh, in Huntington.  And I'm getting...  Not the real Park Ave.  No.  And I'm getting one of these, you know, egg and cheese, you know, sandwiches on a roll  and stuff.  Yeah.  They're very popular on the island.  Sure.  And I look up at their menu, and they have an Opie's sandwich. 
[00:57:30]  And I didn't have the heart to tell them I'm Opie's.  I'm like, dude, you got an Opie's sandwich.  What's that about?  And they're pretty wacky at the deli, because the Opie's sandwich is filled with bologna,  Anthony.  Hey, it's full of bologna.  Whack, whack.  Whack.  That's zainerific.  I just want to let the guys know I saw your sandwich, and I guess I'm flattered.  I think that goes back to the B.A.B. days, to be honest with you, Anthony.  An Opie's sandwich. 
[00:58:00]  Very good.  Well, a lot of people on the phones want to tell everyone where they can listen to us  on the Internet, but that would be a very stupid idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's not...  Let's leave this a little underground, so you've got to kind of search for it.  Yeah, Mike, don't be stupid.  Hang on.  Yeah.  Yeah, and all those people that are emailing me, asking me to plug their websites where  they're streaming the show through the Internet.  No, no.  Can't do that.  Sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  People are just going to have to find it on their own, because we'll get in a lot of 
[00:58:30]  trouble.  All right, Rick, it's Anthony's birthday.  Anthony's birthday.  Surprise number what?  Three?  How many surprises have we had so far?  We've had Joey and the Chimay and the food.  Yeah.  All right.  What was the other surprise?  Oh, the German fisting video.  German fisting video.  Thank you.  Steve, okay.  And now for Anthony's nerd surprise.  Yeah, this is a good one.  This is a good one.  This is a really good one.  I'm scared.  I hate these.  This is good, dude.  You're going to like this one.  Yeah!  All right! 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah!  What's up?  I got to say it.  It's Otto and George.  It's Otto and George.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, Anthony.  Goddamn.  Wait, you better put headphones on George there, too.  Get into the headphones.  Down to date night parking.  How many guys you got in this room?  A sausage party in here.  I'm here with Gorilla Boy.  Yeah, two six-packs of nice to growl and some cold pizza he got in Bayonne.  I didn't know what to get you for your birthday. 
[00:59:30]  I got you a bag of Coke and some sugar up there.  Hey, thanks, man.  Bank a load for me.  Oh, man.  Hey, that's great.  All right.  Oh, this sucks.  We got to tell everyone.  I mean, Otto and George, one of our faves.  Yeah.  Just saw the Caroline's a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  And this is a huge surprise.  We've been trying to get him on the show for a long time now, Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Love you guys.  This is great.  Holy smoke.  It's good to be here.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for coming.  Thank you.  I'm so afraid to even talk.  Otto and George, well, he's got a puppet with him that is very real.  Morris was late.  I had to eat in that Brooklyn diner downstairs.  I had the broken leg of lamb.  That was a joke.  Come to rest.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:00:30]  We should give John the dump guy a run for his money today and just let Otto and George  just go until they run out of delay.  Yeah, John.  And hit the Van Halen song again.  It's your responsibility.  We'll watch our button go black when we realize he's used up all our dump.  Yeah.  Otto and George are going to be at Rascals.  When?  Sunday night, 8 o'clock with Jeff Norris, Gorilla Boy, and Chips Cooney, great magician.  Goddamn.  Chips is probably listening right now.  He's working on a Chris Rock movie. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  He's an actor as well.  Okay.  You've got to go down and check these guys out.  Yeah.  Come on down.  It should be good.  I'm a good friend, Chipsa.  The dummy talking back to Otto.  Why do I even have to come here?  Can't you just do the voice and then you stay home?  Who validates here?  All right.  $35 to come to this place. 
[01:01:30]  Norris, you working out?  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Say something.  You're on the air.  I've got to protect Otto on stage.  Yeah, we need protections.  Yeah.  Drive to my gigs in an ambulance or from the gigs in an ambulance.  Yeah, we saw you down at our car lines.  Yeah.  Man, I was dying.  That's very funny.  That's the first time you saw Otto and George, Anthony?  Yeah.  You've got to go to Rascals. 
[01:02:00]  Check them out, man.  I've been following Otto and George for many years.  I hope you don't mind that I follow you, Otto.  That's okay.  Yeah?  That's all right.  What do you think of Jay Moore ripping off all your lines?  Jay's been good to me.  He put me on his TV show.  I mean, you know, nobody's ever done anything like that for me.  You know, I've known a lot of famous guys.  Mm-hmm.  No, we like Jay.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  We have fun.  He gives you a lot of credit.  A lot of credit. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  He's a little...  Jay's a little off, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think he likes his NyQuil.  Does he?  Yeah.  We all have our cross to bear.  He's that big guy with the camera there.  What the hell is he doing?  Oh, that's Steve, George.  We're recording this for prosperity.  Yes.  Put the camera down.  Do some sit-ups.  Look at you.  Look at yourself.  All right.  There's jelly on that camera.  All right.  Do a sit-up.  All right. 
[01:03:00]  You're wasting away to a warehouse.  Come on, George.  Don't insult these guys.  This is a very important show.  Yes.  These guys are big in New York.  Don't you realize if they plug one of our dates that we could sell out, we could wind  up getting the door.  I'm saying we get the door.  We get the door?  All right.  Which one's Anthony?  All right.  Easy, George.  Easy.  I'm giving out Hummers.  Anthony's the Italian-looking one to your left there.  How you doing?  I can't believe we're talking to a puppy, but...  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  You think he looks Italian?  Looks like a greasy Puerto Rican to me.  No, Rick would be the greasy Puerto Rican right over there.  Really?  Our producer, Rick.  Yeah.  Oh, the guy, that guy, a little misshapen skull going there.  All right.  Looks like a coffee mug.  Easy.  Oh, my God.  This really sucks.  Nobody better fart in here.  All right. 
[01:04:00]  There's a goddamn submarine in here.  Sausage party.  I know.  Those two guys are getting paid.  I'm paying $30 and parking.  There's a lot of guys in here.  I apologize.  We have some strippers coming by in a little while, I think.  That's...  Really?  Yeah.  I'm staying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  These guys are really big in New York, George.  That's good.  That's good.  Yeah.  My friend Angelo Vazio is here with me, my photographer, I'm Greek. 
[01:04:30]  Hello, my friend.  Broccoli, garlic, flour, string bean.  Cheese, cabbage, thin, it's pie.  Daked potato.  It's too early.  He's Greek.  All right.  His balls smell like feta cheese.  It's stints in this room.  Yeah.  Sorry for all the guys in here.  I like a upset.  No, happy birthday.  Jeff brought pizza.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jeff. 
[01:05:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah, it's from Jersey.  You know how the pizza is out there?  It's like Wonder Bread with V8 poured on it.  Get the pizza in Midtown, you schmuck.  All right.  You carried it.  Get your pizza in Jersey.  All right.  You carried it, George.  Like the counter.  He's arguing with the fuck.  You carried it.  You're arguing with a puppet, you little dick.  All right.  On a bench with eyebrows.  All right.  You're all right. 
[01:05:30]  It's going to be some show Sunday.  Yes.  It's going to be great.  Sunday at Rascals, 8 o'clock.  It's going to be a good show.  If you show up.  I'll show up.  Oh, he doesn't show up at some of the gigs there, George?  Yeah, he's a real loser.  I think my mom is listening, too.  Hi, Mom.  Hey, good.  She usually listens to Bob Grant, but I told her to tune in today.  Bob Grant.  Yeah.  You buffoon.  How old is that guy?  When is he going to die already?  All right.  Bob Grant. 
[01:06:00]  Get in the coffin.  George, you should invite Anthony as a special guest for Sunday for his birthday as well.  Oh, really?  You should have him front row.  Special guest.  You're invited.  Come down.  Okay.  Are you giving me lessons on how to kiss ass?  I know what I'm doing.  Get the bumper stickers and get in the car.  All right.  Get the car.  I want bumper stickers.  They should buy us pizza. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Unwinding their pockets.  It's an evil conglomerate here.  All right.  You radio bastards ain't fooling me.  All right.  Wow.  He's a little angry today, I see.  You seem angry, George.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  Okay.  Doesn't seem happy to be here either.  I don't know how a puppet gets so pissed off.  Rough right in.  Schizophrenia at its finest.  I guess so.  Eight o'clock. 
[01:07:00]  Eight o'clock at Rascal's Sunday night.  Thanks.  You're going to have a full house.  Oh, man.  Seats are going to go quick.  Yeah.  Call now.  We're going to make sure everyone goes down there.  Otto and Jordan, nothing like them, man.  No.  You know that film you guys got on your website called The Meal where the two kids are eating  the...  Yeah.  The two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A friend of mine made that, Craig Cifola.  He's...  I made a film with him called Telegrappies.  I just wanted to plug it.  It's called Telegrappies.  It's a short film.  Telegrappies.  And if you want to see it, it's on ifilm.com. 
[01:07:30]  Okay.  That's another plug.  I saw that one, The Meal.  Yeah.  And it's two guys in a backyard eating what appears to be fecal matter.  Yep.  A pataki.  A pataki.  Yeah.  Or a hot lunch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Craig makes these films.  It's great.  Yeah.  Cleveland Steamer.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  They look like a young guy.  Well, they were...  The actors were...  Oh, they were actors.  Yeah.  They were just kids.  Yeah.  I thought maybe they did the movie themselves.  No, I don't...  Someone was responsible behind it? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a casting call.  A casting call.  You don't look real enough eating that load.  Yeah.  That dump.  Yeah.  Let's try it again.  Yeah.  A hot lunch.  Yeah.  All right.  Cleveland Steamer.  All right.  He's mellowing out over there.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm running out of steam.  You're running out of steam.  You've only been here five minutes.  You don't need them all for a beverage, do you?  It just sucks.  It's all right.  It's okay, George.  Four dollars for the bridge. 
[01:08:30]  Parking.  All right.  This guy with the pizza.  They like pizza.  All right.  I was just going to say, I've never seen him so radio friendly right up until that point.  Yeah.  You have to go to Rascals Sunday, eight o'clock, Otto and George.  Yeah.  To hear the Pope joke.  Oh, yeah.  The most amazing joke I've ever heard in my life.  I can't do the Pope joke here.  We understand you can't do the Pope joke here.  You've got to go to Rascals.  That'll be something to look forward to when you go to Rascals Sunday at eight. 
[01:09:00]  With Otto and George.  That's Spaz, by the way.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks, Spaz.  That's Spaz, yeah.  Thanks for the water.  A Snapple would have been nice.  Can't that Indian guy get me a Slurpee at least?  Oh, please.  I don't know.  He's been working here for like 30 years, and you're insulting him?  Who cares?  All right.  George. 
[01:09:30]  30 years, George.  A little respect.  Yes.  Sorry, sir.  My shirt regal in assembly.  Dressed up, happy to be living here.  How are you supposed to have everyone like you if you can insult everyone?  George, don't you want to be light?  Come on.  These are nice guys here.  Be nice.  Be nice to the customers.  Well, I'm scared. 
[01:10:00]  Here it goes.  I don't want to make eye contact.  I don't want to look at the puppet.  He had a rough ride in.  He had an argument with the toll lady at the Lincoln.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you got a little pissed off at the toll lady.  I like to heat up my change, shove the quarters in my butt for a few minutes and a half on.  Here you go, exact change.  You ever do that?  Heat up a quarter and hand it to the guy?  Laughing at him?  That must be something.  You pull up to a toll booth and you're getting yelled at. 
[01:10:30]  George drove in.  George drove my truck.  Yeah.  I got pulled over once and I pulled the puppet out of the back seat and I was going, grab his gun.  Grab his gun.  My friend's going, please shut up.  Don't do that.  Grab his gun.  Let him go.  Let him go.  It's only five beers.  Grab his gun.  Is the Indian guy laughing?  I can't tell with that guy.  All right.  He's laughing a little bit. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, my God.  Rascals Sunday.  Goddamn.  I wouldn't miss it.  Come on.  You're crazy.  Which Rascals?  West Orange.  West Orange.  What's the phone number?  Because we want to sell out this place Sunday.  Unprepared.  No, I don't.  Look it up.  We'll look it up.  No big deal.  West Orange Rascals.  Otto and George Sunday at 8 o'clock.  One of our faves, I'm telling you.  Anthony saw him for the first time, what was that, two weeks ago?  My size part. 
[01:11:30]  I was dying, man.  You had a table up front of women from the Midwest.  Oh, yeah.  And George was relentless.  I was screaming.  Yeah, they looked so Midwestern and rosy and so innocent.  So happy to be there.  They're probably just walking down Times Square and go, oh, look, a comedy club.  We'll catch one of those fun, clean little acts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they're just getting lambasted by George.  Yeah.  Friggin' hysterical, man.  Yeah.  And let's not forget the 14-year-old girl in the front row.  Oh, my God.  That was weird.  That father has, you know, he's got problems. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the father brings a 14-year-old girl to Seattle and George.  Let me tell you something.  She was one hot 14-year-old.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Half the time I'm looking at what's on stage, half the time I'm looking at her ass.  Yeah.  George, did you like that hot little 14-year-old?  Yeah, not too bad.  I like a girl who's got Snoopy on her underwear.  Yeah, what father does that, though?  It was kind of a weird-looking situation.  They had a table all by themselves.  Yeah, that was a little bit weird, you know? 
[01:12:30]  It's like, what are you going to do, rent Caligula and show that to her next?  How open-minded do you want to be?  Hey, honey, look at the fisting scene.  Yeah.  This is great.  Who was it, Joey Puttafuoco?  Yeah.  I thought it was abusive.  It's not my fault, you know.  Yeah, you're doing your act, man.  And he's bringing his young daughter in there.  Yeah, I did this bachelor party once, and the guy, right, ten minutes before the gig goes,  oh, listen, there's a monsignor here tonight.  Can you work clean?  He's, like, sitting ringside. 
[01:13:00]  He goes, why did you hire me?  No, I can't work clean.  I'm to take a walk and, you know, I'm to leave for an hour so everybody else can see what they came to see.  It's absurd.  Damn clergy ruining our good time.  Yeah.  Taking all the joy out of this world.  George, are you awake over there?  Yeah, not too bad.  What did the black lesbian say to the white lesbian?  You the man!  Right, George.  George, Jesus.  Look alive, Morris.  All right. 
[01:13:30]  Happy birthday.  Here's some nice-to-brow and cold pizza.  I like being here.  Maybe he's just on a budget.  Yeah.  Maybe George hasn't got laid in a while and that's why he's so angry or something.  Yeah, I'm pretty horny.  Shivers, Regal, and White Castle next year.  I'm telling you, I know what I'm talking about.  They love that.  White Castle, Shivers, Regal.  Gorilla boy!  I could use some...  I could say pussy? 
[01:14:00]  Why didn't you tell me that?  Pussy!  Well, I don't know if you can say it that way, but...  Why not?  It's not in any context, is it, Opie?  No, you can say whore, too.  You can say whore?  Yeah, you have a very special way of saying whore, George.  George?  Oh, sorry.  Wait a minute.  I'm staring at the console, wondering what I can get for that.  It's the back of the computer I'm looking at. 
[01:14:30]  And Gorilla Boy.  Look at my forearms.  Look how tough I am like Arnold.  All right.  I am tough and strong like Arnold.  All right.  You should have seen him climbing up the side of the building with the pizza and the beer.  Plane shooting at him.  All right.  You big bully.  All right.  Boy, I protected Jay Moore.  You heard about that.  That's awesome.  Yeah, you took a punch for him. 
[01:15:00]  For Jay Moore.  Really?  My buddy.  That's cool.  Yeah, Jeff Doris in the studio.  It's like the secret service of radio.  All right.  We do have the number, Anthony.  Very good.  Cool.  Otto and George, I'm telling you, you've got to go Sunday, 8 o'clock show.  One show only?  Yeah, just one.  Yeah, it's early, so, you know, it's a work night, so people can see the show and still  be in bed by 11.  You don't know what we could do for you, Otto?  Yeah.  We could get you, like, 10 shows like we did Jay Moore.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  You want to just start with Warren?  We can start with Warren.  Okay.  Maybe next time you'll go for the 10?  Yeah.  I mean, that's all I got in.  Sunday night.  Yeah, it's a great show.  And you're going to see Chips Cooney, who was on the Drew Carey show when he did that Mr.  Las Vegas special.  Michael and Jeff Norris, who I work with all the time.  No, screw that.  You're going to go to see George.  Yeah, basically it's George.  Right.  Yeah, screw Jeff.  Yeah.  George is the show this time around.  Sunday, 8 o'clock at Rascals West Orange. 
[01:16:00]  The number is 973-736-2726.  It's going to sell out fast, I'm telling you.  And we encourage everyone to go see Otto and Jeff.  Pussy!  Pussy!  Bitch!  Bitch!  Pussy!  What is wrong with you?  Here's Tourette's.  Pussy!  Pussy!  Out of control.  You got Tourette's.  George got Tourette's.  He's absolutely losing it. 
[01:16:30]  Don't you want to be on network TV eventually, George?  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I guess Conan would be, I mean, you're on it like quarter to two when you do Conan.  I don't know.  I think cable is where it's at right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, HBO should pick you up.  Jesus Christ.  That would be nice, right?  Yeah.  George, would you like to be on HBO?  You want to be on TV, George?  What's that guy staring at me?  He's happy to see you.  All right.  I hate people who are happy to see me. 
[01:17:00]  Because if I walked in here without you, they'd go, oh, you didn't bring George?  They're all sick in here.  They all think I'm real.  Mental illness.  Treat it before it kills you.  Oh, did I mention pussy?  Hey.  Talk-a-doodle-doo.  This is so easy.  They're like children.  Yeah, it's true. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  We got a congressman on the line.  Really?  Yeah, you want to make fun of a congressman, George?  I'll be respectful.  Let me take this call, George.  All right.  Put the homosexual priest on.  Oh, my God.  Gary Ackerman.  Hey, how you doing?  We're hanging with Otto and George in the studio today.  I've been listening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No wonder why your ratings have gone through the roof.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you, Gary.  Thank you.  Oh, Father.  Have a good morning to you.  Now you know the boys lately, have you? 
[01:18:00]  No, he's a congressman.  Oh, he's a congressman?  Yeah.  What did you think I said?  Not a clergyman.  He thought I was a congregation.  Oh.  What district are you?  Uh, the 5th Congressional District of New York.  And what have you done for the poor black man in the street lately?  I didn't mug him.  Easy, George.  Easy.  I've got to compete with a puppet.  Yeah, we all do right now.  There's a couple of Republicans out there.  I've got to get a puppet. 
[01:18:30]  Get some Shivers Regal for the congressman.  All right, George.  I'd rather have to White Castle.  That would be good.  All right.  Whores and White Castle.  A tosar.  Hey, Gary, do you have any opinions on the Elion Gonzalez thing?  Yeah, I'm out of opinion.  Good.  We don't want to hear it.  They're milking this poor thing for everything that's worth.  It's terrible.  Well, let's ask George.  George, do you have any opinions on that?  Yeah, take that little Cuban kid by the ankles and smash his head on the edge of the sink. 
[01:19:00]  Getting rid of him already.  Hey, smash that Cuban skull into some porcelain.  Stick him in a coffee cup and float him back to Cuba.  That's a little harsh.  That's a little harsh, George.  Yeah, George.  Oh, easy.  What do you really think?  Well, what do I think?  No, not you.  Who cares about you?  I'm just kidding.  No one cares about what I think.  I thought that Janet Rito had to send these guys in with the machine guns and everything. 
[01:19:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, as a Jewish guy, I've got to tell you, one thing strikes fear into the  hearts of every Jew.  Two words.  Miami relatives.  That was good.  Aren't you supposed to be working?  Why the hell are you calling to show up?  What the hell are you doing for your district?  Wow.  I'm going to call all the inanthony.  All right.  Well, the puppet's really pissed that you're on the line, Gary.  I know.  I'm competing with a puppet. 
[01:20:00]  I'm taking away his face.  Hey, listen.  Anthony, happy birthday.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  I ran into your brother-in-law, you know.  Oh, really?  Which one?  I didn't get his name.  He was at the one who likes the Mets.  It was opening day at the Mets.  Oh, Johnny.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, good.  He came over to me.  He recognized me right away.  He did?  I don't even know what the hell you look like.  I'm the guy with the train tracks down his back.  Um.  Uh.  Uh. 
[01:20:30]  Uh.  That's what happens when you get hit with a train.  Never mind.  I take it back.  Hang up on the Jew congressman.  Don't get Lou Cabrassi.  A Jew congressman from the other district.  We're not murderers.  Uh.  Hey, listen.  Is that puppet vote?  No.  On election day, I stay home and masturbate.  That's a vote for myself.  Oh. 
[01:21:00]  Get the Jew congressman in the other district.  Well, uh.  Thank you for the birthday wish there, Congressman.  Yeah, you're very welcome.  I haven't done that enough today.  You're very welcome.  You owe me a beer.  I couldn't make it yet.  6,000 pines a day.  Happy birthday.  Sorry you told him it's your birthday now.  You're right, George.  Is cold pizza?  Happy birthday.  Damn it.  Cold pizza.  Does he look hungry to you?  He's very. 
[01:21:30]  George is very mad at Jeff Norris for bringing just pizza and beer.  Oh, he looks so happy walking up with the pizza and the beer.  Look at me.  All right.  Look at me holding this all by myself with my big arm.  He's in good shape.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Gary.  You're very welcome.  You're speechless.  Put the Jew congressman in a headlock.  You have very bad timing, Gary. 
[01:22:00]  Listen, tell Otto I'm going to cut George's strings over there.  Okay.  Son of a matter, man.  I'm up on this guy already.  All right.  No, no.  Come on.  All right, Gary.  Thanks.  Okay, buddy.  Take care.  There he goes, Gary.  Bye-bye.  Confusing George with a marionette.  What a dull, useless guy that was.  Sean, what's going on?  Nothing much, guys.  What's going on with you?  We're hanging out with Otto and George.  They're performing at Rascals in West Orange Sunday at 8 o'clock. 
[01:22:30]  I know.  I was just talking to Spaz, and the lines are going nuts there.  It took me 20 minutes to get through.  Got my reservations.  I am all set to go.  See Otto and George.  Nice.  All right.  I guess you guys could go home.  You did your job.  Thanks, pal.  All right, Sean.  All right.  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, thank you.  Well, I guess they could leave.  They did their job.  They're going to blow their show.  It's going to sell out now.  Yeah, it rocks.  See, George, you don't have to hang out anymore.  Who is your congressman?  Where does he work? 
[01:23:00]  I don't even know.  You don't?  No.  He's not a regular?  He's in Nassau County.  Yes, sir.  First time caller on the Jew, congressman.  It's cold in here.  Throw a Jew in the fire.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't like that.  Hey, it's cold in here.  Throw a Jew in the fire.  Oh, my God.  Oh, jeez.  Hey, Jesus, come on.  George, don't you want to be back at our show someday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was not cold.  It's all right.  What a bitter, bitter puppet.  Very bitter.  George makes Archie look like Bambi.  Yes, he does. 
[01:23:30]  Something must have happened in his childhood.  I thought I made Gilligan look like Sherlyn Hemsley.  Get the Jew congressman from the other district.  We're not murderers.  From The Godfather, right?  One of our favorite movies, George.  We like when people quote The Godfather.  Oh, my God.  That could be some of the most inappropriate stuff I've ever heard on this show. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, but it came from a puppet.  I mean, what can I tell you?  Well, that's our out.  It comes from the puppet.  It's okay.  I don't figure that out a long time ago.  You have to get the venom out somehow.  You know, it's either this or, like, go to a batting range.  You know, you have to somehow get the aggression out.  You can't just go through life, you know, saying rotten things to people, even though you can thank them.  By a puppet.  Yeah, because you seem like a pretty laid-back guy, you know.  Yeah, it's a strange way to make a living. 
[01:24:30]  I mean, I feel weird when I do it, but I mean, I get big laughs and people seem to love it.  You know, I get bored by my own material, but, you know, you just keep going.  You have to do the same act, you know.  Well, there's a couple of people on the line that want to ask George a couple of questions.  Oh, Jesus.  George, you want to answer a couple of questions before we leave?  You're on the air.  I'm taking over, Gorilla Boy.  That's all right, George.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're talking to Otto and George, playing Rascals, West Orange, Sunday at 8 o'clock. 
[01:25:00]  You're on the air, Jim.  Get a job.  Jim?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Okay, hey, this show is so much better when it's uncensored, I'm telling you.  Oh, you hear it on the telephone.  Yeah, the people on hold get to hear the uncensored version of this.  Yeah.  So do you have a question for George?  How old a minute are you, sir?  Huh?  How old are you, sir?  Forty.  Forty?  Still get a kick out of cursing?  Oh, did I curse?  I'm sorry.  Hello.  Hey, listen, George, let me ask you a question. 
[01:25:30]  How do you pick up women?  I mean, you go up to them and say, look, let me show you my pet woodpecker or what?  I'm like a...  Oh, ugh.  I'm that old guy.  No, I'm actually very romantic.  I like to go, like, Valentine's Day.  I get up really early, buy a dozen long-stem roses, pick up a hooker in Midtown and strangle  her and dump her in the Hudson.  What do you usually do?  A retarded mystic calling this show?  I'm 40. 
[01:26:00]  I like it when this show's dirty.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Evan.  Yeah, I want to know, uh, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Happy birthday, Anthony.  Oh, okay, great.  Uh, George.  Evan.  Yeah.  Are you, uh, kind of mad because you have no penis there, you know, your little wood body  over there, you got nothing going?  Is that why you're so upset?  Don't taunt them.  Don't taunt them.  Don't get them going.  Ha ha.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  You got a good one out there.  Go snort the filling in a net. 
[01:26:30]  A little hostile out there in Radio Land.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Where's all this hostility coming from?  I don't know.  They all want to talk to you, though.  Russ, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Look, uh, George, you're one of those puppets, you know, the hand goes up the butt there.  Have you ever been intimately involved in one of those fisting videos?  You should see the look you're getting, Russ. 
[01:27:00]  Come on, George.  We want to know, what is it like in there?  Ha ha.  Uh, great, Russ.  George!  Yeah, he doesn't want to answer you.  You're making the puppet.  Is it mouthful?  You're making the puppet very angry.  Don't make the puppet angry.  They'll hunt you down.  That's right.  They'll hunt you down.  Hey, Ottawa, Maurice wants to know if you're going to be playing Long Island, Manhattan,  anywhere else besides Rascals in the near future.

[01:39:00]  and did you play the uh pick the real rudy game uh yeah on the cover of the daily news at first i didn't  know what it was when i first looked at it i thought maybe it was a rudy look-alike but then  i'm like wow that really looks like this is the biggest story in new york that they have to dedicate  the front page of the daily news and it says pick the real rudy you know it's a slow news day  when they got the picture of rudy and his brand new wax figure right that's going to go in the wax  museum right there's a dead giveaway in the picture besides the fact that you can tell which 
[01:39:30]  one's the wax job but you see the real rudy doesn't have his wedding ring on yeah see that's  kind of weird isn't it like they made the wax rudy with his wedding band on and the real rudy's  standing right next to him and you see his hand plain and clear there ain't no wedding ring on that  no someone someone made a little mistake don't you don't you believe that donna hanover when asked  to choose said it doesn't matter they're both exactly alike and if you work for the mayor's office 
[01:40:00]  though you make sure that doesn't happen it would have been easy just to maybe you know throw a ring  on rudy or cover up the the wax one yeah that's what i think they would have done just don't show  the hands i wonder why he didn't clasp his hands the other way oh yeah that would have worked too  yeah that would have covered up uh i guess they didn't want it to look like he was trying to do  something since then all the questions come out why well why isn't he wearing his wedding well i guess  that's the question that's going to be asked in the coming days even though we all know the answer 
[01:40:30]  but we're not no one's allowed to talk about it why not i don't know no one talks about it you  could talk about the fact that uh they're never seen together as a guy looking in from the outside  it appears that they don't have a very uh good marriage it appears coming coming from me  so yeah i played the uh pick the real rudy game today yeah all right anthony uh uh wow uh officially  kicked off today it's a crappy day for it but uh yeah what's the problem i was looking at the 
[01:41:00]  picture on the post of uh the rudy's no of what millionaire bride oh darva i mean case full full  front nudity pose yeah darva from who wants to marry a millionaire's uh i i you knew she was going to pose  naked at first she was trying to say no i'm not going to do that blah blah blah and then she realized  whoa wait i'm not getting any legitimate offers here and i want to keep my fame going yeah that's what it  is she wants to uh keep her little fame stint going she's going to pose and playboy how much 
[01:41:30]  is are they giving her uh they probably probably close to a mil six figures they're saying six  figures just over six figures yeah for the spread i like that they call it a spread she wants to do  tasteful full frontal nudity pose whatever you do it's still called your spread right tasteful i i love  when they use that you know it'll be tasteful well at least it is playboy playboy but one of the last 
[01:42:00]  mags i think uh that still tries to be tasteful with rise with the uh the nude picks because the the  other one that was running close second for many years was penthouse but they have just gotten to  the point they they're lagging far behind in the in the tasteful category hey darva can you take a leak  on something that's what we need we need you for penthouse it's going to be real tasteful you're  going to be taking a whiz yeah on top of a stack of cash is that good can you take a violin bow up 
[01:42:30]  your uh private area yeah that's what's going on in the latest issue we want you to bend over uh so we  can see what you had for lunch let's see how far this tuning fork could uh disappear did you see the  latest penthouse they got a great spread tarva um got an offer we want you in a german fisting video  is that okay a six we'll pay you six figures to be in a german fisting video  it'll be tasteful though tasteful fisting video you know her people made sure the word tasteful was used 
[01:43:00]  yes she has people of course she has people oh man you know who the next person i don't want to see  her naked and playboy no she's pretty scary she's 34 she uh emergency room nurse she all the pictures  of her she's not hot no the picture in the post is downright scary yeah that's like one of those  people that what you know the people that like the the girls that go to weddings and for all year long  they're plain james which is fine you know maybe not the most attractive girls which is fine you know 
[01:43:30]  then they go to the wedding and for some reason they have to put supermodel makeup on them and do  the hair to the point where now they just look like ugly clowns you know some girls look very nice when  you throw that makeup on and do the hair and the like the the curls and they put it up real nice and  they're wearing the the dress with the long neck and the low cut thing then there's the girls that 
[01:44:00]  aren't meant for the makeup and the big goofy bridesmaid dresses so yeah it's funny you bring  up the bridesmaid dresses because you know you go to those weddings and the bridesmaid dresses are  a lot of times very nice and and and the uh and the bride has very hot friends yeah and they look  really nice in the dresses uh-huh and then there comes uh oh there's a few that humpty dumpty in the  same dress and you're like oh oh that sure is a contrast there's a contrast oh here comes is that 
[01:44:30]  the limo pulling up with the bridesmaids should be a clown car they should all just hop out with  out of the clown car with the makeup and the stuff because some girl and then there's always  someone when the bridesmaids are all together going don't you all look lovely oh don't you all look  beautiful except the one on the end they look beautiful because there's usually like the mother  the hottie yeah the one that just wears the makeup and the hair perfect it's always the best friend 
[01:45:00]  the best friend of the bride always looks so damn hot got the bodies yeah really working the dress  that the bride dress looks beautiful picked out on the dance floor dancing oh yeah looks like a model  and then the bride is stuck she's got to put like her future sister on the same dress oh no oh boy  pile all the hair up on her head slap the makeup on don't even know how to do it because 
[01:45:30]  he never wears makeup no oh big clown no you know who the next one's going to be to pose nude oh  so obvious elian's cousin yeah i'm sure the offers are out there they want well it's going to take a  little while they got it like like do it in hustler though so she could show her taco  so we want to say the taco they got to wait for the case to be completely uh settled yeah but uh you 
[01:46:00]  watch because i mean they're they're publicity hounds down there they they of course they want  this to you know continue as long as uh as long as possible they're enjoying the spotlight yeah and  she'll be she'll be nude mark my word you think oh without a doubt i'm sure the offer's out there  already any time the media for the public latches on to any woman the offers go out doesn't matter who  they are what they look like who was that paula jones right didn't she do one and then the other 
[01:46:30]  one the other hose bag that clinton was banging jennifer flowers for flowers yeah who wanted to see  that clinton's got the worst batting average yeah just scoop pigs and they're all there with their  handout looking to get his cash and then the playboy uh things come in they'll grab that cash cash  the guy  you just suck it you ugly effing whore come on come on sucky and he's saying exactly what we just said 
[01:47:00]  for 20 minutes always a fat towel in bridal party yeah i think that's what we just said right  all right earl's uh back i guess he gave out all the wow stickers and how did uh stinky uh  yeah fair i heard the cops were chasing him around yeah he did all right he's back he loves  the cops man they they went out there and just started chasing stinky around with handcuffs and  stuff you know what the funny thing the funny thing with the cops yeah half of them want to arrest  like members of our radio show and the other half want to just make believe they want to arrest

[02:08:00]  wet cloth you animal look what i just did to you you know now wipe me down cool me down over here so  that's romantic yeah exactly that's what that's my point that's why i'm together for so many years i know  how to treat her you know they start walking out of the room you grab them by the pony sale get over  here look what i'm gonna do hey dice were you on the view a long time ago oh because we got a call 
[02:08:30]  that says dice was on the view oh they probably reran it i don't know him because i'm so handsome and  chums what are you doing on that show though well anytime i see a guy my last failed sitcom hits  tv just doesn't work out for me for some reason i had to be the nice dice no no i had to be the  cute cuddly dice on that show they didn't want me to be too nice but they still wouldn't let me you  know i i you know i feel very confined in that kind of situation it's a very special episode of 
[02:09:00]  advice yeah you know what i mean when i get a tv show i know it can't go more than three weeks  now why is that because they don't let me do my thing if i did like a sitcom on hbo that would be  different so you just pocket the cash and run well you know i try to make it work and uh you know then  you know the produce you know you know what the funny part was you know on these sound stages they 
[02:09:30]  don't allow smoking yeah so the first episode in a scene i lit up the cigarette you know and the  fire marshals come running like i just torched the place you know and they're going he's smoking you  know you know the third episode everybody hanging around was smoking they go there hasn't been smoking  in a sitcom since 1969 and this guy is smoking in every scene now 
[02:10:00]  and then i couldn't figure it out when they canceled the show they go look we either cancel  the show or this guy's going to burn down paramount you know now that that one sitcom you're doing  though they had the spin doctors coming on and saying that you were uh the nice dice that one i was  like what what is the doctors well not the you know the people that like to uh give you a different  image we're done with the different image you know what i mean because i was waiting for the  very special episode i'm going to blow your mind with it what do you got you know i'm going to blow 
[02:10:30]  your mind with it an album yeah when's it coming out uh september yeah are you coming back to new  york uh well right now all i'm doing is the vegas shows yeah i'm not touring right now i don't want  to talk are you going to be flying us out to vegas so we can check you out well you know i think you  have made enough money that you could handle the earth it's it's all gone for me it's gone it's  gone i had money come on she's not going to take everything she can't take everything yeah you want  to be my lawyer you know what i mean what what is the problem with her get her on the phone i'll talk 
[02:11:00]  i don't think that's going to happen you know get her on the phone i don't think that's going to  happen i'm telling you i know i know how to talk nice oh yeah look at me an example i get her on the  phone i go uh you know look how about i stop over once a week you cut the payments in half  little banana juice that are nice and sweet good for you good for me you know what i mean i'm over here 
[02:11:30]  the hard-working guy you know what you're going to wind up marrying some other idiot anyway you know  what i mean what is she looking for in this world i don't know you know i don't know what was it why  did she say she didn't want to be with you that's what i want to know i can't go into details no but  you can say why she didn't want to be with you i'd shut the shut all the outgoing mics off for two  seconds okay go ahead what happened oh all right all right we're back on the air okay 
[02:12:00]  you know i won't say what you just said but something like that is not grounds for divorce  you know what i mean like you know you know if you bang the dozen at a cliff  it's a different situation i could see a little aggravation you know what i mean don't you understand  the only reason to get married is to have an affair you can't have one without it 
[02:12:30]  you know it's one thing if you if you got a girlfriend that you're nailing and you tell  oh there's this chick donna i'm banging yes so what you don't got a wife at home that's in misery  but if you've got a wife at home that you know by the end of this affair your whole life's going to  be in turmoil you're breaking doors you're slamming your car into brick walls you know there's going  to be excitement put back into the marriage that's the reason for an affair you get the juices going 
[02:13:00]  which brings me back to bananas you're like a philosopher dice exactly that's why all my friends  call me for love advice oh jesus you know most of them are divorced now but you know i couldn't help  that they didn't listen wow that's funny you know what i'm saying uh now we're getting uh email saying  anthony it seeped right through the speakers  yeah see my wife just came in she just went right by me didn't say hello didn't give me a kiss 
[02:13:30]  that's the perfect marriage it's like i don't exist you see what i mean that's how you make something  work as long as you keep uh bringing the paychecks home no you know what i mean you don't talk if  there's talking there's going to be a problem you know what i mean how did everyone hear everything  everyone why do you think movies were invented yeah to break the awkward silence of marriage  because once you're living with them there is nothing to say anymore the game is over so now 
[02:14:00]  you're both sitting on a couch looking at each other and you go hey honey you want to go to a  movie and she looks at you with that dumb face yeah that sounds like a good idea so now you go to a  movie so you got a couple hours to watch other people go through their misery you know what i  mean i mean that's so dumb that after you leave the theater she's asking what do you think happens  to them what happens the tape ended stupid ass now we get in the car we go home but you know the  saddest part of going to a movie with your wife after you come home and you're in the driveway 
[02:14:30]  and you look to your right and she's still sitting next to you that's when you realize this is  awful this is not a bad dream this is not a nightmare it's going to continue so you should be counting  your lucky stars that you got out of this thing i'll tell you that right oh thank you hang out over  at anthony opi's place yeah you know i'm sure uh his girlfriend like 15 or 20 sisters you know you know

[02:55:00]  him calling back i know i know he has a way to listen to us in la and i think that's i think  that's really scary all right let's go uh right back to the phones i love when dice is on this show  lewis black hey oh lewis happy birthday and god knows you should celebrate it with dice and jay  yeah is that i'm amazed those two gay guys are still talking you better be careful dice is 
[02:55:30]  going to call back well i've already added it i've already had my thing with dice who is this who is  this farm what you had a little uh episode we had an altercation at one point really what happened  he called the radio show that i was on in the morning and uh and then got on the phone and  you look you just look this business is such a pain in the ass when you call and there's another  comic-con instead of saying i never heard of you you know who are you where do you play right it's 
[02:56:00]  like you know i am not it's 7 30 in the morning jackass we're not going to discuss this thank you  for thank you for like kind of dumping all over my little like oh yeah why don't you come down to  boo-boos and haka you know it's unbelievable yeah wow wow so i went berserk yeah oh you did oh yeah  cool well yeah you know my my natural instinct is to attack right as opposed to going oh no that's  charming thank you thank you you're right you are a better person than i am hey lewis yeah where are you 
[02:56:30]  i'm in chicago yeah because we've been trying to uh hunt you down the last few days oh it's been nuts  i've been i've been in like uh now i just travel all the time i'm just on a plane yeah it was nine  cities in seven days wow well because you know that whole elion gonzalez thing you know happened  and i'm like man the perfect guy to talk to is lewis black well i was you know i kind of went back  and forth on the issue until i realized you were waffling on it yeah well you know you kind of go do  they go in do they not you know and plus they really help by going yeah we're gonna maybe okay we 
[02:57:00]  are well we're not sure yeah well no now oh yeah now they jump in and it's like eight in the morning  and i'm watching this and i'm thinking oh you know now i got to think of another joke  and i was thinking you know i was glad they took him out because actually it was kind of like i  thought you know i felt like he'd been in my house for five months yeah you're just tired of it so just  take him and put him in a new house and at least you know i'll have to adjust to that but it's and  then i i i don't know why they just didn't take him uh out of the water and electroshock him 
[02:57:30]  and skip all this stuff let's just go right to the chase get him in a home and give him feed  him some gruel yeah something because that kid is that kid is going to be it's going to be a gay  guy talking to a transvestite talking to his mother uh he's going to be 19 personalities if he's lucky  and three of them will be cuban and then we got the uh the hot little cousin that was uh oh yeah she's  hot yeah she's boy you want to be spend some time with her dad dad dad dad like some sort of a bird 
[02:58:00]  run amok right how did they end up thinking she was hot i mean i'm alone all the time now and even i  didn't get excited did you imagine her wandering around the home oh alien's going shut up talk about  nerve-wracking beyond a jewish girl and there'll be calls on that no i mean that's that thing i've  always said i didn't know cuban women had that ability to whine i said the jews i love this joke 
[02:58:30]  i just say it anyway because what the hell this will probably destroy something but uh the jewish  woman that's the problem the reason is why don't you marry a jewish girl lewis and i said well the  reason is is because by the time they hit like about 60 65 they actually have a whine that's permanent  in their voice no matter what they're talking about and it's actually if they've uh they've discovered  it's the sound of a thousand uh pigs being slaughtered she had that going already oh god 
[02:59:00]  how do they think she's hot it might be my like completely out of touch with reality well she had  the bj lips yeah and then the uh nice uh perk cans and a pretty good ass in those blue jeans yeah but  she opened her mouth there's nobody a guy's just completely mad i mean what are you dice now lewis  huh what are you dice now but she opened the mouth hey well he is a better comic than i am 
[02:59:30]  occasionally we're forced he told you so he knew and the other thing is uh you'll love this i went to  the um uh the uh democratic national committee fundraiser because the comedy central crew was  invited because john was the host yeah uh and he did quite a nice job i i i i i'm always i go to  watch john do that stuff because i would be i had a bit apoplectic within eight minutes i mean it's like 
[03:00:00]  you know i couldn't be that near them right so it's the first time i've seen clinton live and he really  is i think it's i get the women just get it it's like what happened that you know a guy who basically  has the personality of a really good used car salesman yeah would turn them on it's that power  thing man oh god they love it it's amazing hasn't helped me well i don't think you have quite the  power that uh bill clinton well yeah i guess you're not a smooth talker uh lewis you're a little bitter 
[03:00:30]  i think i think the way we want to stray away from the bitterness you know oh man you might want  to smooth smooth out your delivery a little bit maybe that's right yeah but uh and then al gore  spoke and it i have never used the word turgid ever i don't even know what it means but it certainly  applied uh it was it was turgid it was unbelievable it was like somebody pouring hot wax in your ears 
[03:01:00]  until your brain was completely numb and i'm sitting there going you know i agree with him and by the  time he was finished i hated everything i believed in and him too i hate myself for believing he's got  that power uh got that power behind him he it's a great line that i uh jr havlin who writes for the  daily show said that he went up and standing in line to meet him you know yeah there are about 50 people 
[03:01:30]  and he thought i should go meet this guy could be the next president then he said yeah well to hell  with it and he walked away and he says he walked away he thought you know i would i would actually  stand in a longer line to go on a log ride at an amusement park it's unbelievable they were unbelievable  it was just done and temper just gives me the creeps and hillary is not even she's she is has been  electroshock there is no connection between her voice and her body there is absolutely she is uh 
[03:02:00]  like you know they talk about how men and their emotions are separated she's the i've never seen  anything like she doesn't look real anymore no she's completely someone is uh broadcasting her  she's being broadcast from another city and it's coming through her well lewis when are you coming  back to new york i'll be back i'm going to try to see you guys uh at the end of next week oh please do  get back here and get in i'm going to be at caroline's and then on may 9th i've got my uh  specials on comedy central i heard that was very good it came out pretty good cool all right lewis

Okay.  Your show's been real funny today.  We were listening to it all day.  Yeah, what a surprise.  Yeah.  You guys got us all liquored up.  I didn't think we were going to even make it in today.  I remember you said it back up earlier, right? 
[03:15:30]  You said she doesn't sound as intoxicated as last night.  I wasn't even drinking last night.  Now I see that.  Yes, okay.  You can use that as an excuse, I guess.  I'm just having fun.  So what were you saying that last year, when they do, they were...  They handcuffed in.  Yeah, it was just very uncomfortable.  I wasn't very happy with...  Well, no, we had like, you know, a big fat girl came in and stuff. 
[03:16:00]  It was like...  Vibrator.  Right.  Vibrator.  And I was like, oh, please.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, you were the one messing around with me.  I was trying to find out who you were.  Yeah.  They were bouncing me around.  They told me, who is he?  I said my name was Bob.  And I pointed to Ben and said, there's Anthony.  Hey, did my girlfriend give you my number?  Or her number, I guess I should say?  Well, I said that to you earlier.  I was just joking around.  What?  You were worried? 
[03:16:30]  She said she was going to call when I was in today.  Because, like, we knew we were coming in today, you know.  Yeah.  She told me she didn't call, though.  No.  Oh, I'm upset now.  Look at this.  What I learned on the show today, Jim Brewer's goat boy is now dancing at Privilege.  Who reminds me of the guy from Red?  Did you ever see the play, Red?  Oh, Ben does?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great when we're on the radio.  That's very good.  That's very good.  Yeah, he looks just like that.  Yeah, you had too much fun last night.  You had to come back and visit us.  Yeah, that was a good time.

Yeah.  Lynch, we had a great time today.  A lot of fun today with the Dice Man and Jay Moore on the phone yelling at each other.  Oh, really?  Oh, you've got to hear the tape of this. 
[03:17:30]  It is the most ridiculous argument, even more ridiculous than the one with AirSick Productions.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Or any blows exchange or it was all on the phone?  It was on the phone.  I think Dice is waiting outside the building, outside the Brooklyn Diner, waiting for Jay Moore to show up.  Yeah, well, hey, I'm in North Carolina.  Actually, I just crossed the border into Virginia.  God damn.  God damn.  I did a show last night at a little school, you know, Wake Forest University.  Yeah.  And you guys have some fans there. 
[03:18:00]  Get out of here.  Are you kidding?  You can believe that.  Yeah, one guy's from Jersey, so he listens to you whenever he's home.  Yeah.  And somebody else has a friend who makes tapes of the show and sends it to him.  Well, we like the people that are bootlegging the show.  Yeah.  Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.  It's got a low-tech syndication, but it's syndication.  Well, yeah.  Actually, they're bootlegging the show on the Internet now, too.  It's hysterical.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we had a girl from California call up earlier.  She listens to us every day from California.  Yeah.  Syndication, however.  Yeah, however you can get it. 
[03:18:30]  Well, Lynch, unfortunately, we've got to cut you off because we've got to get off the air.  Yeah, we're allowed.  That's cool.  I'm a long way away from home anyway.  All right.  Well, stop in and see us soon, okay?  I will definitely do so.  Look at everybody on the road making money and stuff.  Isn't that great?  They're all working.

[03:19:30]  All right.  All right.  We've just got to do one.  What did we learn today?  Tom, what's up?  What did you learn on the show today?  Guys, I learned I sprayed banana juice.  Okay.  There you go.  He was educated.  I was a little scared because it says on the screen that you learned that you like banana  juice.  That would not be a good thing, I don't think.  Absolutely not.  Okay.  Hey, Dreamweaver.  Happy birthday.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Actually, Wrangler.  Okay.  And you made it through?  Yes.  Happy birthday, old pal.  Very good.  I will make sure that on your birthday, nothing bad happens.  I mean, that was the only thing I had to do with this whole thing.  I just told Rick that, you know, you might want to just kind of keep it a little different  than last year.  That's the only thing I did.  I mean, we got to thank Rick.  He put the whole damn thing together today.  Yeah.  He got everyone together.  He had a big coup with getting Otto and George here.  I thought that was huge.  That was cool. 
[03:20:30]  Hugger than huge.  Otto and George playing at Rascals Sunday at 8 o'clock, West Orange.  Ticket's going fast.  Ant and I highly recommend you go see him.  Yes.  Very funny on the radio, but I mean, he's like 10 times funnier in person because you  get to see the puppet and everything.  The puppet.  Yes.  The puppet.  Good show.  Very good show.  Jeff Norris, thank you.  Thank you.  Steve from the unofficial Opinant at the website, foundryanthropy.com.  Joey, Joey from Joey Paisano.  Joey.  Joey.  Ah, pasta lunch specials.
