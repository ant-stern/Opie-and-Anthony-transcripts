<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing the weather and a potential snowstorm, followed by promotion of their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" segment and sticker request details. Opie admitted to being sleepy.  Anthony then announced an upcoming 5 PM call with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith, expressing some doubt about its success due to past band conflicts. They reminisced about previous interactions with the band.

The show then transitioned to their "Run Around Park for Errant" contest, which involved finding a person named Aaron in Central Park and removing his underwear from his belt. This sparked a discussion about a similar, but cancelled, Ron and Fez contest ("Fez's Ass Grab"), prompting Ron and Fez to join the show in studio. They explained their contest’s premise (finding Fez in the park, extra points for a police officer's hat) and the reasons for its cancellation, highlighting the difference in acronyms as a key factor.

A caller, Erin, detailed a childhood rape fantasy and her current need for rape-related fantasies during sex. This led to Jim Norton joining the conversation remotely, referencing a rape scene from "I Spit on Your Grave." Erin expressed interest in meeting Norton, who agreed, eventually arriving at the studio.

The hosts revisited the "Run Around Park for Errant" contest, mentioning an angry email from NOW and their dismissive reply, reiterating the contest wasn't about sex or assault.  A show staffer, Rick, then suggested a new WrestleMania trip contest: "The I'm Not Gay Contest," involving naked men in a small bathroom, with the last unaroused man winning.  This generated a lengthy, humorous discussion and numerous outraged listener calls. The hosts ultimately deemed the contest unfeasible and moved on, playing a Stephen Lynch song before the segment ended.

The next segment featured the "Erotic Price is Right" game with Jim Norton in studio. Callers guessed the price of adult novelty items, with prizes including Jerry Red Wilson concert tickets and a Mafiamob.com membership. Callers were frequently asked their location and teased about their accents.  The show featured descriptions of numerous sex toys ("Pleasure Swing," "Super Stretch Senso Vagina," "Mr. Big Shot," "CyberSuff"), along with sexually explicit jokes and discussions.  The Super Bowl halftime show, Aerosmith's performance with Britney Spears and NSYNC, and their new album *Just Push Play* were also discussed.  A caller’s story about double-charged tickets and her sexually active 73-year-old grandmother led to a humorous exchange about Norton’s interest in the grandmother.  The segment concluded with the call from Joe Perry and Steven Tyler, who discussed their Super Bowl performance and the album’s creation.

The subsequent segment focused on Napster and the music industry's response, transitioning into a discussion of Aerosmith's collaboration with NSYNC and the perceived damage to their credibility.  Listener calls detailed sexual fantasies, including rape roleplay.  Jim Norton was a significant in-studio guest during Erin's visit, and their conversation dominated this segment. Numerous callers shared their sexual fantasies and roleplay experiences. The hosts discussed their recent interview with Aerosmith, particularly their NSYNC collaboration and the perceived hypocrisy surrounding fan recordings. The segment concluded with more sexual fantasy discussions and listener calls, featuring numerous sexually explicit and offensive comments.


The final segment featured a lengthy, sexually explicit phone conversation with a female caller, "Aaron," with graphic details about her sexual preferences and experiences.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton (in studio) elicited increasingly outrageous details.  The conversation included tangents about negotiating relationships, Norton's potential date with Aaron, and Jim Florentine's (in studio) comedic performance.  Other listeners called in, sharing sexual anecdotes or attempting to book Norton for gigs. One listener expressed concern about the show's explicit content.  A playful, sexually charged exchange between Aaron and Norton culminated in Norton playfully slapping Aaron on-air, with Aaron's enthusiastic participation.  The segment ended with further sexually explicit discussion and a story involving "Spam Chunks" on a bed.  Crude language and sexually suggestive remarks were prevalent throughout. Images related to Aaron and the discussion were mentioned or sent to the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  How are you?  Fine.  Now we're having fun.  Yes, of course we are.  It's the O&A Show.  I'm just fine. Whip them out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yeah, it's not that bad outside.  Wow, we'll be here before you know it, eh?  Well, as long as we get through the rest of this winter, yes. 
[00:00:30]  Winter's over.  No, Opie, I hear the weathermen say that Thursday we have a snowstorm coming.  So I'm already shopping for bread and milk.  And I'm buying another snow shovel.  I have 12 in my garage.  But you've got to buy a new one and an ice scraper.  We were coming back from lunch and that guy just bought a brand new,  spiffy, sharp-looking snow shovel.  Snow shovel, brand new.  And I look at it and I'm like, man, we've had snow on the ground for two and a half straight months, 
[00:01:00]  especially if you live in the Burbs.  Yeah.  And this guy's finally getting around to getting a snow shovel.  Getting a shovel when it all melted today.  Well, we have maybe one more storm left in us.  Yeah.  Maybe two.  No, I don't think we have any.  They're saying Thursday, but you hear how the weathermen are saying it?  Like Thursday, there's a possible slight little chance we may have something that might look like snow.  They're totally hedging their bets now.  So that's when you should be careful. 
[00:01:30]  I will laugh my ass off if the skies open up and it snows like insane.  Isn't that rule?  That would rule.  God, I would love that.  All right, so get ready for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  If you want to get your stickers in advance, I suggest you do that by sending us a self-addressed stamped envelope  and send it in to 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  What's wrong, Ed?  I know I was forgetting something.  My coffee.  I left it on my desk in the office and I'll fall asleep. 
[00:02:00]  I'm sleepy.  I need a nap ski.  Easy.  Don't worry, Opie.  You are not on the hook today.  No, we're going to get to Rick in a second.  There's so much to discuss today.  You know, I'm going to announce what's happening at 5 o'clock.  Yeah, because then when it doesn't happen because some prick gets involved and Fs us over again,  then everyone will understand what we deal with on a daily basis around here. 
[00:02:30]  At 5 o'clock, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry call on the radio show.  So now if it doesn't happen, you can figure out who got involved and F'd us once again,  even though we're in the same company.  It's supposed to be a happy family.  Watch and see.  Watch and see.  New album just pushed plays out and we're going to talk to the boys.  We go way back with Aerosmith.  Yeah.  We really do.  Back to the old AF days. 
[00:03:00]  Remember the last time we talked to them?  It was in New York when we first got here.  Yeah.  And Ant and I are like, I don't know if they really remember us and stuff from our Boston days.  I mean, we interviewed them a couple times and they came in and did the guest DJ thing.  Yeah.  But Ant and I are like, you know, but they do that with a lot of personalities and radio stations.  First thing out of Steven Tyler's mouth, holy S, what the F did you guys do?  What did you do to the mayor?  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, they kind of remembered that.  So we'll see.  We'll see how it goes.  Looking forward to that.  Yeah, we haven't talked to them in about a year and a half, so.  And let's see if we actually get to.  It'll be a miracle.  God damn miracle.  So we got that at five o'clock.  A lot of people.  Wow, the email just exploding over our latest contest, Anthony.  I know.  Run around Park for Errant.  Getting a lot of emails about this from people I don't think that normally listen to this program.  Know what I mean, Opie? 
[00:04:00]  And we went to lunch today with Ken Stevens, the big boss.  Yeah.  And we told him.  Oh, yeah.  We told him, all right.  We told him.  We'll see if it works, but run around Park for Errant.  Right.  And I got this lovely little email today.  I don't need that.  You brought my lunch, Opie, that I didn't need today because you forced me to go out with Ken Stevens.  Well, we had to talk about Run Around Park for Errant. 
[00:04:30]  I understand.  Those meetings kill me.  And I had to turn up the music in the sushi restaurant.  The lunch meetings kill me.  And then we go in there.  They didn't have a table, so we're waiting by the front door.  And that's where they keep their stereo for the restaurant.  You're going to ruin this, man, because they listen to us now.  I don't care.  I think they're on to it.  This was a nice little gag I had going on.  It's a little bet thing, a little wager of nerves.  There's a radio there, a little stereo system right by the front door on the counter where you pay your check. 
[00:05:00]  And it controls the music for the entire restaurant.  And I've noticed, because we've gone there a lot, that it's always on.  And you see the volume going up and down, but you don't really hear the music throughout the restaurant.  Yeah, they've got the little LEDs.  It shows you the volume, shows you the pulse of the music, a little EQ kind of thing going on.  Yeah, and the volume's usually at three or four, somewhere low like that, because it's a restaurant.  You don't want it too loud.  But you don't hear it, so I'm thinking that, you know, the patrons need to hear the music. 
[00:05:30]  You need to crank it up.  Well, Opie turns it up to about six first.  Yeah.  And you kind of hear it getting louder.  Yeah, you hear it kind of in the background.  And then the challenge.  Right.  I dare you, I bet you don't have the balls to turn it up another couple of notches.  Right.  So we've got to look for the guy that owns the place.  You know, you look around, make sure no one's watching you.  And I cranked it up to like ten.  And I'm thinking I just like totally, I beat you.  Well, because now you hear the music.  Now you start hearing the music.  And now people are starting to get a little uncomfortable and they don't know why. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Because you're just kind of effing with their, because you make them talk louder.  Right.  Because they've got to talk over the music.  And Mr. Fuji still has no clue.  No, not a clue.  So then Opie goes over and goes, I've got to pop it now.  It's on ten.  You crank it up to twelve.  Twelve.  Right.  Then I crank it up one more to thirteen.  Right.  Opie goes, eff this, sixteen.  Cranks it up to sixteen.  Now it's so loud, I'm hearing it thumping from the back.  You just hear everybody talking louder and louder. 
[00:06:30]  It is a fun game.  Because when I went for sixteen, you got real nervous, Ken got real nervous.  Oh, I had to walk away from you.  Yeah.  I walked away.  I'm like, what?  And then we finally got a table, while it's still on sixteen, we sit down and I look over  at the stereo, and you see the LEDs for the volume just booming up to the top of it.  Like you're in a club or something.  It's just going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  And then Mr. Fuji figured something was wrong and he turned down the music.  Turn it down.  But whatever. 
[00:07:00]  Mr. Fuji.  So why do we bring this up?  Because I was dragged to the meeting.  Instead of one, though.  And it took forever again.  Well, we had a point, didn't we?  Oh, because we had to go there to talk about Runaround Park for Aaron.  Yeah.  Our latest contest for a trip to WrestleMania in Houston, Texas, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, yeah, the email exploded.  People outraged, Anthony.  Outraged.  I don't know why they're outraged. 
[00:07:30]  This has nothing to do with sex.  Not at all.  But a lot of people outraged.  A lot of listeners really digging it and want in and want to try to win the trip to WrestleMania.  Ron, does everybody know this whole thing and how it'll work?  Does everybody understand the rules of this?  It has nothing to do with sex or assault or anything like that?  Ron and Fez are hovering.  I think they want in on this one.  Because they started their own contest.  They ripped us off today.  Yeah.  They were ripping us off. 
[00:08:00]  They got a contest very similar to ours.  You want to explain yours as Ron and Fez walk into the studio?  Yeah.  It's an homage.  Oh, my.  All right, explain Run Around Park for Aaron and then we'll get Ron and Fez involved and they'll explain their little contest.  We set loose Aaron in Central Park.  She's easily identifiable as Aaron in a way that we will let you know.  She has a pair of panties hanging off of her belt.  The job of anybody that wants to win is to find Aaron in the park and snatch her panties off of the belt. 
[00:08:30]  She will evade these contestants and if she does it every hour she evades the contestants, she wins a better prize.  So, we're looking for someone that can run fast.  Maybe can run.  Maybe can hide behind brush and not get winded and not look stupid like the girls in the horror movie.  Good.  Falling down and screaming as the contestant gets them.  Right. 
[00:09:00]  So, we have the panties hanging from Aaron.  Yeah.  Because if there's a lot of guys, you know, converging on poor Aaron.  Yeah, it can't be like Tag because you'll never know who actually Tag.  We need to get a clear-cut winner so it's the person that rips the panties off of Aaron.  Rips them right off of him.  Right.  And that's the game.  Did you hear anything about sex in there, Opie?  Did you hear anything that Aaron might be hurt doing?  No penetration, nothing.  There's nothing even close to penetration. 
[00:09:30]  Penetration.  That's a great word.  And now, boys, what's your homage?  Our game is completely different.  Way different.  All right.  What is it?  This would have Fez in the park.  I would be in the park.  You're in the park and people have to find you?  Yes.  And what's the name of the contestant?  I grabbed my panties and it's Fez's Ass Grab is the name of it.  Fez's Ass Grab.  And we got shut down today.  I don't...  Hey!  Now it news. 
[00:10:00]  Now it news.  That's too damn good.  During Fez's Ass Grab, he's wearing a pair of panties.  He's running to the park.  Your job is to find Fez, penetrate him, or really anybody who looks somewhat like him.  Now in your game, the girl's running, right?  Running like crazy.  I don't run.  I don't resist.  I lay there on my stomach waiting.  Fez, where's the fun in that?  He's passive. 
[00:10:30]  Well, Fez is fun.  Yeah.  I didn't say it was fun for the competitors.  You're selfish.  He's willing to let this go on all day and night until we get a winner.  By the way, we're also giving extra points if you bring back a cop's hat.  That's different.  There's a little something different.  Scavenger hunt.  Our thing got shut down.  Yeah.  By the way.  There was an oil spill on the reef.  Oh.  Yeah.  The reef is now damaged.  The reef is damaged.  Right.  I hate it.  Because I want to hear the big island. 
[00:11:00]  They're all by themselves, the big island.  Now see, we haven't been shut down officially yet, and you guys have.  Yeah.  We've got to shut down quick.  Maybe it's the acronym you're using.  Right.  Fez's ass crap.  Fez's ass crap.  Yeah.  I haven't worked on it.  Wait a minute.  It all comes down to the acronym.  The acronym is what it's all about in this business.  Yeah.  Fez is underwear capture.  Fez is somewhere in Times Square. 
[00:11:30]  Uh-huh.  Fez is somewhere in Times Square.  No.  No.  It's Fez.  Because the word is is never used in an acronym.  Right.  You know?  We had to explain that yesterday with our little game.  Runaround Park 4.  Aaron, 4 is never used in an acronym.  So you're still on.  Capture underwear, not T-shirts.  Nice.  I like that.  I like that one.  That's a good one.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well, I hope it works out.  Yours is off, I guess. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Yours is off.  But I think it was a little too close to your game.  Is that what it was?  It's probably what the deal was.  Yeah.  See, that's what I'm thinking.  Ken Stevens heard yours and said, look, we don't want to make any waves between the two  shows.  Because, you know, some of these shows get with each other.  I know.  But are we still doing Wieners Out Wednesday?  Is that still on?  Wieners Out Wednesday?  We're going to do that and then Squeals for Meals.  Squeals for Meals.  I like that.  That is still on.  That's with toddlers.  That means with toddlers.  It's a babysitting slash game. 
[00:12:30]  It's either that or Pasta Palooza.  That's funny.  Hey, the rape girl is on the line.  Uh-oh.  Erin.  Hello?  She calls herself this.  Hello?  Yes, Erin.  Hi.  Hi.  See, I don't see what the big deal is with the game.  I think it's a great game.  I just think you need a girl to volunteer to be the Erin being chased around.  Yeah.  So, it's her fantasy.  Yeah.  This is the girl.  I think we explained this to you guys in the hall.  She had a rape fantasy. 
[00:13:00]  When she was a kid, she would dress up in her father's overcoat, grab a knife, and her  friend would walk into the room.  She would hold the knife to the friend, and they would be naked, and they would rub on  each other.  I still have a problem.  Well, I don't know if it's a problem.  You guys tell me if this is normal.  Okay.  Still, when I have a sex, no matter who it's with, if I'm very in love with a guy, boyfriend,  whatever, it orders me to climax.  I can say that, right?  Yeah, sure, sure.  Sounds nice. 
[00:13:30]  I have to sort of fantasize about the whole, like, rape thing.  That he is assaulting you?  Not even me, necessarily.  Just, like, some scenario, like, six scenes from movies I've seen, like, with, like, young  girls and old guys.  Do you know our friend, Jim Norton?  I think you'd get along very well with him.  Well, I got along very well with Psycho Mark.  I was smoking the AK-47 with him that night at a scooter.  No surprise.  This is not even a surprise. 
[00:14:00]  Anthony, Jim Norton is checking in.  Norton.  Norton.  Who is this girl?  It's Erin.  Hi.  Hi, Erin.  I think I'm in love with you.  Jim.  Yes.  What's that movie you were talking about that had, like, that 20-minute sexual assault scene?  Oh, I spit on your grave.  I spit on your grave.  Oh, my God.  That's the worst thing in the movies.  I liked it when I was, like, nine.  I think we've got a love connection.  Oh, my God.  I feel like that's one of the things I have to picture.  When I'm, you know, when I'm with someone, that's one of the movies that I was set to 
[00:14:30]  farm.  Girl, sick.  You're so, I would love to assault you on a rock in the woods.  Jim, Jim, for the people that don't know that movie, why don't you just give a quick  synopsis of that scene?  All right, I'm driving, so let's hope I don't go for my crotch.  She's doing something in the woods, asking for it, as far as I'm concerned, and four  good old boys attack, beat, and rape her for over 20 minutes.  No, she was taking a boat out.  She was taking out her canoe, and they surround her on the canoe, and they, like, they get, 
[00:15:00]  they drag the canoe off to, like, some edge of the water, and they chase hours, like,  it's the third day, like.  Well, the important thing here is the race, not the canoe.  I was getting to that.  If you're not in a kayak, it was a canoe.  It doesn't matter.  Erin, this gets you hot?  Thinking of that, yeah.  I mean, it's not like I'd want it to happen to anyone, but that's the only way that I  can climax.  See, that's what it is.  Certain people do fantasize about this, and it doesn't mean that you want it to happen,  or you want anybody getting hurt, but there are people that fantasize about this and get 
[00:15:30]  off thinking about it.  Erin, Erin.  It's fine to fantasize about whatever you want, right?  Do you have a boyfriend, Erin?  No, I need one.  Oh, can we hook you two up on a date?  Yeah, we want to hook you up with Norton and get, like, a controlled rape environment going.  We'll just call it date rape.  Hey, Erin, let's take off our clothes and rub each other up and read about the Robert  Chambers case.  What do you say?  All right, Erin, when should you get your ass down here? 
[00:16:00]  I could come down later today.  Or we could just creep in your window tonight.  You really want me to come down there?  I can come down later today.  What do you look like?  I know the people that want to pick her up right now.  I'll get her.  Erin, I'll get her.  Norton?  What do you look like, Erin?  Norton, she's hot.  They have one picture of me flashing on, but that's not even the best picture.  I'm pretty cute.  Norton, she's surprisingly hot, yes.  Right?  Really?  Yeah.  Norton, where are you?  Do you know what I look like?  No, I don't know what you look like, but I love comedians. 
[00:16:30]  That's where the problem is.  I like anyone that can make me laugh.  Well, if she's into rapists, I think she'll like you.  I'm funny and I enjoy rape.  I mean, this is not a match made in heaven.  Hey, I'm funny and I enjoy rape.  Oh, my God.  It's like a goddamn disturbed version of the dating game.  I love connection.  This is great.  You like the disturbed dating game.  All right.  I actually called for it, too.  I didn't even call to talk on the air.  This is definitely God talking to us.  We have to get together.  Yes.  Where are you?  I am right now. 
[00:17:00]  I just...  Right now, I'm in the middle of my...  All right, hold on.  I'm trying to see where he is so we can get him down.  Let's talk to Norton first.  Norton, where are you?  Right now, I'm on 70th Street in Columbus, right around there.  I just had an awful audition because I suck.  All right.  Are you coming down here?  I was calling for Rick.  I had a question about some paperwork I had to fill out, but...  Yeah, come on down, man.  All right.  Well, I was going to come down next week, but if Aaron's going to be stopping in, I'll  definitely come down.  Aaron?  Can we come down in three hours?  I've got a meeting.  Three hours is pushing.  Wow, that is so late. 
[00:17:30]  That's like 620.  They're off the air.  What time is it right now?  It's 320.  All right.  What about two hours?  Yes.  Yes, that's fine.  If you could really make it in two hours.  Okay.  Where are you guys located?  You would hold on, and we will tell you.  Okay.  And we're going to kill you, you bitch.  Oh, this is so great.  Yay!  All right.  And Norton, you're going to come down too, right?  Yeah, I've got to stop off and buy duct tape and a hammer.  Hey, wait, buddy.  You better not blow me off, boy.  No, I won't. 
[00:18:00]  Believe me.  Not at all.  Norton has never blown anyone off.  No.  No.  All right.  Except boss.  All right.  Hold on, both of you, okay?  Okay.  There you go.  Look at this match.  I love connection.  Oh, God, is this disturbed.  Beautiful.  That's nice.  See?  That's good work.  Two people together that are into the same thing.  Some people into biking.  Some people into boating.  Some into running.  Some into race.  So, is the contest still on?  Is that where we are right now?  Oh, we haven't been told.  We have a go. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  We're thinking Ken was kidding yesterday.  I'm sure.  When we were talking to him on the phone, he said, absolutely not.  And he never directly said, no.  Right.  Run around park for Erin is going to happen.  And so, I get this email from the NOW organization.  National Organization of Whores.  I think it's from now at now.org.  There you go.  Because they're an org.  So, we could give out their email address if you're an org.  The only org they'll ever have on the end of their frigging name. 
[00:19:00]  Subject.  Rape type bitches.  Subject.  Rape game.  Yeah.  Even though we're not calling that.  We're calling it run around park for Erin.  Right.  So, now has to say, not only is this wrong on so many levels, you wouldn't be doing this  otherwise, but don't forget that saying the mayor of Boston was dead on April Fool's Day  wasn't illegal either.  The voyeur bus wasn't illegal either.  How many strikes did WNEW give you?  Do you want to schedule an appointment to meet, or shall we deal with this in the press?  Oh.  That one's got their back hair all up.  All ruffled. 
[00:19:30]  Someone's mullet is all in a fray.  So, my response was very simple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We thought long and hard on the response.  I wrote, Ant and I don't do well when it comes to threats.  That's true.  And then I wrote, go to hell.  Go to hell.  They should like that.  Go to hell.  But this is all about Erin.  It's empowering to Erin.  Right.  See, she's the one making the move.  She's running.  She will, well, no, I guess not.  She's driving this train, so to speak. 
[00:20:00]  It's her body.  It's her choice.  Blah, blah, blah.  I think it'll be fun for everyone involved.  No one gets hurt.  And there's no sex.  There you have it.  There you go.  I'm surprised it's even on our show.  With no sex.  And good luck with your contest there.  It's already open.  Ours is dead in the water.  And it's going to be a great homage.  I guess.  Ken Stevens put a start to it, though.  He beat that fetus to death right there.  Fez ass crab. 
[00:20:30]  Threw that baby to the dog.  Maybe.  You know, maybe if you guys want second prize, and Fez will be out there with her.  Sure.  And see who goes to Fez.  And who goes to Aaron.  Fez would be a lonely, lonely man.  Hey.  Hi.  If he's not found in two or three years, that'll be bad.  He'll be like that dog you leave in the cold during the holidays.  I am right here.  I can hear everyone in the room.  You know those old commercials, you know, when you first get the puppy, it's all cute and nice.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  And they show everyone watching the football game, and the puppy's now a grown dog in the back with the chain.  And it's thrown out there.  Maybe Marco will catch him.  Oh, yeah.  That's a match waiting to happen.  He'd fly there.  Yeah.  A little tinkerbell.  That's what I get for trying to do an homage.  Homage.  Homage.  Isn't it?  Great.  All right, guys.  Thanks for letting us drop in.  It's Ron and Fez.  No problem.  They're on from 9 to noon.  Yes.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no. 
[00:21:30]  Don't start.  Ships change so frequently around here.  I don't know when anyone's on.  I'm Ron and Fez.  We got our days at 3 a.m.  Right.  New to 3, of course, right before us.  I'm sorry.  You know I know that.  What an idiot.  Ron and Fez.  Steven Tyler and Joe Perry calling in at 5.  When we get back for break, we've got to talk about Rick's latest contest idea.  Rick's contest idea.  Rick, get in the barrel.  It's brilliant.  And we'll get into it next. 
[00:22:00]  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  O.P.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  W.N.E.W.  212-757-1027.  The O&A Show.  What's that?  You want to get into Rick's idea?  Uh, not really.  Well, yeah.  You know what I mean.  Of course I do.  We do have this trip to, uh, WrestleMania.  Yes.  We were thinking we may need some backup, uh, contests. 
[00:22:30]  So, uh, to be fair, I'm just gonna let Rick go on the radio and explain his contest idea for the WrestleMania trip.  Now, I have to tell people he did run this by me on the train the other night.  Uh-huh.  He ran this by me today when I first got into the office.  And, uh, Rick, you have to describe this exactly like you described it to me in the office.  Or you'll get our help, which I don't think you want.  So just describe it exactly like you described it in the office. 
[00:23:00]  I guess what we're getting at, we don't want to influence the opinion, the opinions of our listeners.  Right.  We just want you to hear it from Rick's mouth.  There you go.  And do what you will with it.  Yeah.  Well, maybe give us some feedback.  Let us know if it's a good idea.  It's good for this show.  Um, whatever.  Rick, comment?  I think I'm gonna turn the music off for this.  Okay, Rick. 
[00:23:30]  To you.  To you, Rick.  Like, like Opie said, I ran it past him the other day on the train.  We were taking the train home.  And we were trying to bat around some ideas to give away the WWF trip.  If Keith has a story, a full 24 hours before he told you.  Yeah.  And there's a reason for that, that I didn't tell you.  Oh, there is?  Yeah.  Okay.  I figured I'd let him slide.  Oh, right.  I have to say it.  I figured I'd let him slide.  Maybe he was a little white-headed.  Maybe he was a little hungry, a little tired from working all day. 
[00:24:00]  So I'm thinking that, you know, he gets home from his commute, gets a meal in him, and a good night's sleep.  He might forget that he ever suggested the idea to myself on the train.  But no, it turns out he ran into work and told you.  Oh, man.  Yep.  So he was still into the idea.  So with that said, Rick...  It's not like I'm into the idea.  I just had the idea.  I threw it out there.  No, if you don't get backpedal, just throw out the idea.  The idea.  That's it.  Okay.  Since we have this WWF trip to give away, we're looking for something different to do to get 
[00:24:30]  people that, you know, let's find the people who really want this trip, not some, you know,  contest hog, to try and win it, right?  Good.  Am I on the right track?  Totally.  You can spin all you want.  Okay.  Okay.  Sure.  Now, we have a lot of guy listeners who love the WWF.  Sure.  Would love to go to see, you know, WrestleMania live in Houston.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So we're batting around ideas, and I had an idea that maybe could test the limits.  Test the limits. 
[00:25:00]  Testing the limits of someone.  Test the limits.  Of some...  Of guys.  Of guys that really...  See if they really want to go to this.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  I'm with them so far.  Well, we're still waiting for the idea, though.  All right.  Okay, Rick.  All right.  So we're on the train, and I say, oh, what about this?  Figure out who's the biggest fanatic and who really, really wants to go.  And we could call it...  They call it the I'm Not Gay Contest.  All right.  The I'm Not Gay Contest. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  People, strap in.  Ladies and gentlemen, we've gotten word there's going to be a little turbulence coming up,  so please, if you could return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.  Be appreciated.  Hopefully, we'll get through this and continue on to our destination.  Thank you.  Do you remember Tom Hanks in Cast Away?  Yeah.  Strap in.  Strap in.  Strap in.  Don't go for your watch. 
[00:26:00]  No.  Strap in.  You're going to need to hold on for dear life.  Go ahead.  The I'm Not Gay Contest.  The I'm Not Gay Contest.  All right, Rick.  Testing the limits of the guys who listen to this show who really want to go on this trip  to go see WWF.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  We're still waiting.  Uh-huh.  We've got the J-More Suite.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  We fit like five or six guys in the J-More Suite, which of all we know is very small.  It's, yeah, as big as a closet. 
[00:26:30]  It's maybe.  The bathroom.  It's a very, very, very small bathroom.  Small bathroom.  Three by three.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Five guys in the bathroom.  Right.  We run a mic into the bathroom.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  And then we put the guys into the bathroom with the mic.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to ask you to please put your trays up and your seats  in there, upright position, and make sure those seat belts are tightly fastened, turbulence  a little stronger than we expected. 
[00:27:00]  You can get bumped around a little bit.  Thank you.  So we put the guys in the bathroom with the mic.  Five or six guys.  Five or six guys.  Or maybe seven, if we can squeeze seven.  That means guys would have to be touching each other, by the way.  Yeah.  Not on purpose, but they would be brushed up.  You can't get three guys in that bathroom.  Very close quarters.  Yes.  As big as an elevator.  Right.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess that.  All right.  Smaller.  Whatever.  Get it.  They're all in there. 
[00:27:30]  And since it's called the I'm Not Gay Contest.  Right.  All the guys would have to be naked.  We just lost all our engine power, and we're plummeting toward the ocean.  Rapid rate of speed.  There's no chance of pulling out this.  So you think we could find five or six, maybe seven guys.  Five or six guys.  They go in a room the size of a closet, a little bigger, and get completely naked.  Right.  I don't go about it or dead.  And we bring up strippers. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, I didn't hear anything about strippers.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I'm trying again, dumbass.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Just like you said in the office, there was no stripper.  All right.  No stripper.  You can try to bring the stripper into the picture now.  I think he's feeling the pressure.  He's trying to get out of this one.  He's starting to sweat.  It's how he.  Dang it.  He's got the cold sweat happening.  He figured he would reach.  All right.  All right.  No strippers.  No strippers.  Reach for a life preserver.  It ain't going to help.  By the way, as soon as you said the guys are naked, the phones just went. 
[00:28:30]  I know.  Everyone's calling.  So the guys are all in there naked.  And the last guy who doesn't get aroused wins the tickets.  Last guy who doesn't get aroused.  Like the only.  The guy who doesn't get aroused.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That means you're counting on guys getting aroused.  Six guys getting aroused.  Looking at each other?  Looking at each other in the bathroom.  Being stuck.  Why would you think.  Being stuck in those clothes. 
[00:29:00]  Why would you think any guy would get aroused in that situation?  Because sometimes you get those.  You get those what?  You get those errant boners for no reason.  And when you're standing there with naked men.  You never know.  Oh, my God.  I never said.  I never said it happened to me.  I'm just saying we can put people in that situation.  Oh, my God.  And see if they can prove they're not gay.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Oh, ouch.  Ouch.  What?  How are these guys going to get aroused?  Flaming debris. 
[00:29:30]  It's raining down.  Flaming debris.  Sorry.  Someone wants to know if the steroids have gotten to your brain.  Whoa, man.  Explain.  So six guys are going to have to get six guys in these clothes.  How are they going to get aroused?  Yeah.  Just by being in that situation with naked guys?  Well, what we do is we pipe in stuff.  And we keep the microphone in there as soon as they start.  Pipe in stuff.  Like we have like a girl talk really hot and sexy to them.  Oh, that'll do it. 
[00:30:00]  That's like a friggin' eyedropper on an inferno.  Right.  I mean, what is that going to do?  Rick, this could be the gayest guy.  You pipe in girls moaning and stuff and you think the guys are going to get aroused?  Yeah.  The situation's too gay.  You're going to need something.  I don't even think there's anything out there.  There's nothing that could get rid of that gayness.  You're in a gay situation.  You think just a girl, you know, piping in a girl moaning is going to take care of the situation?  But you think seven naked guys in the bathroom, enough right there.  It's over, John.  But I'm going to play this out with him.  I'm like, okay, okay, maybe we can find the seven guys. 
[00:30:30]  I doubt it, but.  Haven't you ever like been in like school or something?  You're in the gym shower and some guy gets a wood for no reason?  Oh, Rick.  No.  I've never.  I've never.  And then people look at him and go, oh, I think that guy's gay.  I never even showered in gym class, I don't think.  I just never went.  I've showered, but you don't.  I've never seen a guy with a, I guess you could say boner in the shower.  Never.  Come on, Rick. 
[00:31:00]  This is great.  So he tells me this on the train.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  By the way, great job on the show today, and I'll see you tomorrow.  No, that's not what you said.  You said, okay, there could be something there.  Run it past the guys.  Well, yeah, to set up this fine bit on the radio.  So today, I run it past the guys.  Dude, how could you think we were going to look at this and go, yeah, this is great.  All right, let's get seven guys to get naked in the bathroom.  Wow.  Well, Joe wants to start.  Joe, yes.  Fag. 
[00:31:30]  Biggest fag on the place.  Dude, what's this guy doing?  They're going to want to sit in a room together naked.  What's wrong with you?  In a bathroom?  Some of the people that watch this stuff on WWF are maniacs.  They don't want anything to try and win a trip.  Are you going to tape this and, like, watch it later when, like, you're by yourself and stuff?  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.  Wasn't this the plot line of Chocolade, Rick?  Will there be chocolate in the closet?  All right, Chocolade.  Thanks.  Chocolade.  They'll eat chocolate while they're in there.  That'll turn them on. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Bill, what's up?  Bill's laughing.  Bill.  Yeah.  I'll tell you, I'm a big WWF fan, and I would do it.  You would do it?  I would do it, definitely.  You'd get naked with seven or six other guys in a small bathroom.  Hey!  I wouldn't enjoy it, but I would definitely do it.  I mean...  And if he's not gay, he's got nothing to worry about.  Oh, believe me, I'm not gay.  Rick, will you be the judge to make sure that...  Yeah, how are we going to make sure they're all getting...  They're officially out of the contest?  Well, the other guys in there would rat him out. 
[00:32:30]  Hence the microphone.  That means guys have to check out other guys' stuff.  It's...  No!  It's not like you're staring at it.  It'd be like, uh-oh, look.  The guy next to you, look, he's starting to get, you know, aroused.  This is the gay...  I feel gay just talking about it.  Hey, L&A, who's the winner?  How do you determine the winner?  There's got to be no winner.  Well, Rick goes in and gives the squeeze test.  Wow.  To make sure it's a real stiffy.  Well, Rick will be...  He'll put the stamps around everyone's junk.  We can do that.  The guy who doesn't break his stamps. 
[00:33:00]  Great idea, O.  I would love to go to this.  I would love to go to WrestleMania.  Great idea.  They're already calling it the homo bathroom on opanthony.com.  Homo bathroom.  Homo bathroom.  Thanks, Bill.  We are off the radar screen.  Thanks, Bill.  Rick, go back to Universal Studios.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Rick, keep your dreams separate from the show, you faggot.  I love hamburgers, but I'm not going to go bang a cow, you queer. 
[00:33:30]  Jesus, Anthony, Christ.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Later, home.  You're really pissing people off with your idea.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I was Joe Allsport in school, and there was this one guy who was just good enough to make  every team, but never played first string.  Uh-huh.  Every time in the locker room, this guy was getting wood.  Oh.  And the coach talked to us and said, it's nothing.  It's just what happens. 
[00:34:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, lo and behold, 10 years after school, I run into him at my wife's gay friend's gay  Christmas party, and he's as queer as a $3 bill.  My wife's gay friend's gay Christmas party.  Was it called the gay Christmas party?  The gay Christmas party.  What was Rick wearing that night?  Oh, you got me.  I was wearing a schlong.  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  See you later.  All right. 
[00:34:30]  I suck.  Dude.  I bet you we can get, like, five to seven guys to do this.  No.  Why would we want to?  Doug from Springfield.  Doug?  What's up?  May I speak to DJ Max, please?  Are you kidding me, Rick?  I wouldn't do this for a supermodel.  And I'm sure, uh, you've got to be kidding me.  I can't even talk with this.  Isn't this the gayest concept for a contest you've ever heard?  Rick, face it.  You're gay.  Their marriage is a big hoax.  All right.  You know what?  We need to hear from a gay guy.  Would a gay guy even do this?  I don't even think gay guys can do this. 
[00:35:00]  I don't think Marco would be in in a minute, but that's gay Marco.  Let's go to Nick.  Nick?  That's not fair to the speaker.  Yo, O&A.  Hey, Nick.  How are you?  Listen, I've got four words for Rick.  Coffee, tea, or me?  You choose, Rick.  All right, buddy.  Take care, guys.  You're a girl.  Rocky, what's up?  What's up, O&A?  Love your movies.  What's going on?  I want to ask Rick if he's going to judge a contest with his gay dog. 
[00:35:30]  You f***ing.  Yeah, someone's got to be in there with Guy.  And what happens?  How long does it last?  What if all of them are standing there horrified?  No one gets a wood.  And what?  Someone would die in that bathroom.  Oh, please.  Someone would die.  Dennis wants to do this.  Dennis.  See, he's got a second guy.  Dennis.  Oh, he hung up.  Yeah.  All right, so we'll take that under consideration for the WrestleMania trip, right? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, this sounds great.  Yeah.  That's a good contest.  Jim Norton just arrived.  God, it didn't take him any time at all to get here.  Oh, and he knows a chick that's into the rape fantasies coming in for him.  Let me go to Jumbo.  Jumbo, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Listen, this is an observation, man.  Rick has never been the same since she ate that chocolate penis.  Syndication when Rick comes out of the closet.  All right.  Later, boys.  Bye.  I am not gay. 
[00:36:30]  After that idea.  Dude, it's not a bad idea.  Dude, it is the gayest thing.  It is gay.  How could you come up with a concept of seven naked guys in a bathroom?  Because it tests the limits.  It tests the limits.  To see who's dedicated.  And, of course, it's an all-day contest.  If I was a listener, I would just be sitting there going, I guess I'm not going to WrestleMania.  Oh, so the joke's on everybody because no one's gay.  Could be.  We'll find out.  That's a rough one. 
[00:37:00]  It's not like I'm saying the first guy to get aroused wins.  No, the guy who doesn't get aroused wins.  But you're looking at the odds of even one guy getting aroused unless he's completely gay.  You know what's weird about your whole idea?  At least one guy would get aroused.  You know what's weird about your whole idea?  What?  And I've got to carefully say this because I don't want the brush fire to come my way.  You didn't even mention a girl in your whole scenario.  Right.  Well, no.  It's the un-gay contest.  I don't think it would have saved you, but it might have helped.  See, I've got to be careful here. 
[00:37:30]  Help your contest idea if you at least would have said there were chicks involved in the bathroom.  No, they can't.  You didn't even go there.  That doesn't go with this contest.  Are you gay?  Oh, yeah.  Well, then why don't we just put on a porch.  Porno and a small TV in there and see who can hold out.  That's a winner.  That's a winner.  Here's a guy saying he's straight and he'll do it.  Keith, what's going on? 
[00:38:00]  Yo, man, I'll do that.  Yeah?  I don't know.  I'm not gay, but for those tickets.  I think it's a good idea, Rick has.  Sure.  No way, dude.  He sucks.  That's the worst thing I've ever heard.  For a second, Rick was feeling all proud.  Like, look.  What a fag.  Is he going to stare at the man junk?  No.  Yeah.  Who's going to stare at the man junk?  All right.  Oh, my God.  Nice.  Good luck.  I'll be in the car.  All right.  We could get a chick to be the judge. 
[00:38:30]  Well, Anna wants to be the judge.  Anna.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  You're on the radio, Anna.  Oh, I am?  Yeah.  How about high?  Oh, my God.  You sound high.  I'm not high at all.  All right.  What's up?  Well, I'd be more than willing to be a junk inspector for you.  See?  And I think you need to put a chick in there, you know?  No, that wouldn't work.  No.  One chick and six guys?  Anthony explained it to me.  But then if the guy gets wood, it's because of the chick, and then he's not gay.  Right.  Like, if they break up against each other. 
[00:39:00]  No, but there's just one chick, and he's still surrounded by guys.  No, see?  Because if you get wood with just the guys, you're gay, and you get thrown out.  See, if you get wood when the chick is in there, then you're not gay, and it ruins  the whole contest.  Right, Rick?  No, no.  It changes the contest.  It ruins the whole fabulous contest.  Fabulous?  I thought he said it was gay.  Fabulous.  Fab.  Oh, fabulous.  Fabulous.  Well, you need someone to judge, right?  No.  No, Rick is judging.  No, I'm not judging.  But Rick's too gay to judge. 
[00:39:30]  No, can I go on the record and say we're not doing this?  I think that's safe.  Have we lost our minds?  I think that's a safe bet.  All right.  Yeah, get Norton in here.  Thanks, Santa.  What if a bunch of guys want to try and take this challenge on?  Oh, my God.  Then you'll have to do it in the privacy of your own home, Rick, because we're not going to  do it here.  Why don't we run the idea by Jim Norton, who's a sexual deviant?  We all know that.  Yeah.  He would do pretty much anything, okay?  Right.  Jim?  Oh, is this the contest that Rick suggested?  You heard, right?  Where you put six nude men in a room and give them Viagra and show them Philadelphia and 
[00:40:00]  use Bruno Kirby as a fluffer?  He knows the contest.  I don't know, Kirby.  Oh, man.  We should.  Maybe hook him up with horny goat weed and stuff and make him take it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Norton, do you like the idea?  I don't know if it would work, though, because how are you supposed to get these guys around?  I don't understand.  I quit part, but I was coming up to the party.  See, the guys will just be in there, just seven naked men in a very small bathroom. 
[00:40:30]  Rick wants to pump in girls' moaning, but that goes against the whole gay idea, too.  The whole concept is who is gay, and you have to throw out the gay guy.  So whoever gets wood gets thrown out of the bathroom, and then there's six guys left.  Whoever gets wood after that gets thrown out.  The last guy left wins the prize.  It would have to be guys moaning that you pipe into.  We could do that.  We'll get, like, gay videos.  But you're not going to get anyone to do this, is what I'm saying.  No one is going to do this.  The gayest concept ever, ever. 
[00:41:00]  Norton, do you like the idea?  You're a sexual deviant, so I would understand if you said yes.  Here's what I like about the idea.  See?  Six men would have to go home to their wives and explain how they didn't win.  Yeah.  I got thrown out first.  Yeah.  I couldn't taste so much man meat.  Think about it.  They're standing there.  What if they rub up against you?  They're like, oh, I just went cheek to cheek.  Oh, now he's fantasizing.  What if they rub up against each other?  Yeah.  Rich, what's going on? 
[00:41:30]  Wow, nothing much.  Eric, how do you figure getting in a bathroom with a whole bunch of naked men to only go  watch half-naked men roll around with each other, not gay?  How do you figure it?  Yeah, it's pretty gay.  You didn't load them in there.  Oh, yeah.  I bet you'd love to load something in there, wouldn't you?  You butt burglar.  That's all right.  All right.  I know we could do it too, man.  Maybe in the middle of the contest, if it's not working, you send Justin Volpe in there  with a plunger.  Yeah.  Do it up. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  So is it safe to say that this is not going to fly?  This is not happening.  Not happening.  All right.  Well, we got...  Great idea, though, Rick.  Keep them coming.  That's good.  That's a good one.  I was hoping he was going to forget about his idea, but he came running in and told you.  Full A-hole penetration contest.  Next, Rick.  Man on man, A-hole penetration. 
[00:42:30]  Why not?  Well, yeah.  Because that's gay.  All right.  Well, here's a little ditty from Stephen Lynch.  And we'll be back.  This is a song that I wrote, actually, a couple days ago after...  Excuse me.  A friend of mine, my best friend, we went out to a bar and we got really hammered.  We just had a really good time.  And I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times that you have with your  pal when you're out drinking at night?  You know what I mean?  And so I wrote this for my best friend, my friend...  This should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  I'm going to touch it. 
[00:43:00]  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you.  Here we are, dear old friend.  You and I, drunk again, laughs have been had, tears have been shed, maybe the whiskey's 
[00:43:30]  gone to my hand.  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants.  It's not that I don't care, I do. 
[00:44:00]  I just don't see myself in you.  Another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you, if you know what I mean.  Cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul.  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being.  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls. 
[00:44:30]  But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand.  It's radio, you know.  We've never hugged, we've never kissed.  I've never been intimate with your fist.  But you have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your drum. 
[00:45:00]  Thank you.  Boobs, the world's universal language. 
[00:45:30]  We're trying to get the gayness out of the studio.  Let's rock.  I don't see that happening.  Not after that whole rick thing.  Great contest idea.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We want to move on, cause we have Jim Norton in the studio.  But the phones are exploding, Anthony.  Yes.  Want to quickly tell everyone Rick's fine idea for the WrestleMania trip? 
[00:46:00]  Well, Rick suggests we take seven naked guys, listeners of the show.  Put them in the bathroom.  And one by one, as they each get wood, they get removed from the bathroom and lose the contest.  And the last one that doesn't get wood, obviously isn't gay.  So he wins.  But wouldn't he be gay for just going in a closet with other guys and getting gay?  Right.  Right.  And then you got, six of the seven guys have to get wood before there's a winner? 
[00:46:30]  I don't know.  Unless you're getting them from the village.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, Rick's new name, Mango, the gay Puerto Rican from Saturday Night Live.  There you go.  Mango.  Can't wait to see that signal.  Hey, listen.  Yes, Tom.  You cannot possess mango.  Right. 
[00:47:00]  This contest is gay, even for gay guys, man.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Jay Marcos checking in.  We'll talk to him in a second.  Thanks, dude.  John, who's part of the Gay Long Island Organization.  Hi, guys.  Hi, John.  Hi, how are you?  Good.  I belong to the Long Island Gay Coalition over in Huntington.  You from there, Alfie?  Huntington?  Huntington, yes.  Okay, we're out there.  A lot of us listen to you.  We love you guys, and we can't stand Marco.  He's a screaming queen.  He gives homosexuals a very bad name.  You sound kind of gay, though.  I'm sorry? 
[00:47:30]  No, John, this is the worst.  No, no, I'm gay, but I'm a man.  I'm a man gay.  I'm not a Marco.  He's a queen.  No, it's not Marco that gives gay people a bad name.  It was the Bible.  You have to give Rick credit for imagination.  He's trying.  He's working.  John, this is the worst fake gay voice ever.  Sounds a little good.  I know, Rick's a fake.  I couldn't take it.  Shemote, man.  All right, thank you.  You broke down.  Gay Marco, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I have one word for Rick. 
[00:48:00]  Brilliant.  He is so brilliant.  I am so proud of Rick.  Oh, my God.  He's fabulous.  This contest, oh, my God.  I wish I had thought of it.  Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco.  Do you have your gay kazoo?  Oh, I don't.  Sorry.  I don't carry it with me everywhere.  But this contest is second only to guess what's in my crack.  Don't you stare at it?  Fabulous.  That's a winner.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  So you like the idea, huh?  I think it's terrific.  I would love to be a part of it in any way I can. 
[00:48:30]  I don't think it's happening.  Well, why don't we get seven guys naked in a room, and I give them oral.  And if they sport, then they're...  All right, stop.  He came up with something that may be gayer than what Rick came up with, but he's flaming.  Hey!  Well, someone is suggesting we put five gay guys in the closet with Rick.  Let's see what happens.  Me, me, me, me, me. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, man.  All right, thanks, dude.  Okay, I'll go back to work.  All right, bye.  Bye.  I don't know.  To come up with an idea like that.  Or how about you get, like, six or seven guys, and they all plug Mark on, and the one  who pulls out the small Hershey's kiss on his helmet wins.  Oh, oh.  It's long to leave.  All right, right.  That's a winner.  This is legal, isn't it? 
[00:49:30]  Wish somebody put this retard out of his misery.  I'm pissed off, Rick.  How are you?  I'm too sexy for my shirt.  I don't play.  Hey, I'm gay.  Sexy, it hurts.  Hey, I'm gay.  I'm too sexy for me, man.  Hey, I'm gay.  I'm bit it black.  York and Japan.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm gay.  I'm too sexy for your party.  I am gay. 
[00:50:00]  You hear that, everyone?  I'm gay.  I'm a model.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  I'm a model.  Here, slip is here.  On the catwalk, yeah.  I like dog, dickhead.  On the catwalk.  Nice head, dick.  Howdy.  Bagot.  Don't squeeze it.  Hello, cutie pie. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get away.  My car, too sexy by far.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  It's in the hole.  Too sexy for my hat.  Too sexy.  Bagot.  Would it be marvelous if I turned out to be a homosexual?  I'm a model.  You know what I mean?  And I do my little turn on the catwalk.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Ouch.  So what do you think of my tight pants? 
[00:51:00]  Well.  But dang.  Oh.  I think we're going into a weird area here.  Yeah.  Like having your background.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  I'm a bad boy.  Yes.  Puss-a.  Puss-a.  Puss-a.  Virgin.  I'm thinking of my mouth.  Yeah.  That's hot.  Yeah, on the catwalk.  Yeah, on the catwalk.  Excuse me while I whip this out. 
[00:51:30]  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  Are you my best?  Yes.  For birthday, can I...  Hey, he keeps licking his finger and touching me.  I love, love going to...  Puss-a.  Puss-a.  Puss-a.  Puss-a.  Wonderful.  Well, there you go.  You've got some funky-tasting spark.  Oh, God. 
[00:52:00]  Got herself a pretty little faggot.  Hey.  All right.  So, moving right along.  Michelle, what's going on?  Yeah, I can help get rid of the gayness in the room.  I gave my first wow today.  Hey!  The sun came out.  It was kind of nice today.  It's beautiful out.  Where did you do the D?  On Route 380 in Pennsylvania.  Oh, thank you so much. 
[00:52:30]  Unfortunately, the guy asked for a BJ, and he kind of ruined it for me.  But, you know, I guess that's what you get when you flash a trucker, right?  What an ass.  That's what I said.  All right.  Don't let that discourage you from wowing again, okay?  Okay.  Well...  Guys.  Thank you, Michelle.  We tell you a thousand times.  When a girl wows you, she doesn't accept the wow.  Man, it's a trucker in Pennsylvania.  All right?  I don't know.  Give him the wow a bad name.  Well, yeah, because, you know, then the girls aren't going to want to do it.  Yeah, a lot of people have been wowing today, it seems like. 
[00:53:00]  Sun's out.  How about a BJ?  Jackass.  He reamed it.  Oh, that's funny.  That's funny.  That's cool, though.  Yeah, it is ripping my Wednesday, Anthony.  Rick, are you the pivot man and the circle jerk?  The pivot man.  The pivot man.  He's got to guess the whole batch.  The pivot man. 
[00:53:30]  That's great.  All right.  I think that's funny because I don't know what it is.  All right.  The thing I want to say about wow, Anthony.  Yeah.  As we get closer to spring when it's just going to explode all over the tri-state area.  As we all know, wow is very big in the spring and summer.  Get ready now by getting your wow stickers.  Yes.  Get them early.  Self-addressed stamped envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  Just tell us how many you want and we'll send them right out to you, okay?  Yes.  All right.  You want to start our game now, Anthony?  Yeah, we're going to play a game. 
[00:54:00]  Going to play a game today.  Jim Norton is here and you picked a good day to be here.  You can help us out with the erotic price is right.  All right.  Erotic price is right.  We have some fine prizes.  I'm hanging up on a lot of people so don't write a nasty letter saying we hung up on you.  They will anyway.  I know, but we've got to clear the phones.  Where are the...  Do you got those, Ben?  You need all the descriptions. 
[00:54:30]  I'm like the guy when they say, Johnny, tell them what they want.  Okay.  That's who I am.  This is an easy game to play and it's educational.  Well, what has happened here, we have a lot of stuff to give away, Anthony.  Yes.  So we want to, you know, give away a lot of things here.  Concert tickets for the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit featuring Jim Brewer, Lewis Black, and Adam Farrar.  That's going to be a great time this coming Tuesday at Town Hall and Times Square. 
[00:55:00]  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.com or give them a call.  Ticketmaster, that is.  212-307-4100.  We also have a year's membership to one of our newest sponsors, Anthony.  Yes.  Mafiamob.com.  Mafiamob.com.  A website that Anthony is really, really digging.  So we'll give some of those away.  What else do we have?  A lot of people joined up.  Oh, my God.  You know, when I was first directed to the site, I get on there and I'm a little soldier in one of the families. 
[00:55:30]  And now all of a sudden, oh, there's people all over.  Now I'm seeing there's people in jail.  All these newbies got on and tried to whack somebody, I guess, and got put in jail.  You've got to slow down, people.  Don't bite off more than you can chew.  You've got to start slow and feel your way around, right?  Yeah.  All right, so you want to play The Erotic Price is Right?  We've got a ton of people on the phones that are ready to play, Anthony.  The Erotic Price is Right, Opie. 
[00:56:00]  Everyone that plays will get something, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, what?  We actually have the music?  What are we, a real radio show?  The Erotic Price is Right.  The concept, pretty easy.  We'll get contestants on the phone and we'll bring up an item, an item for bid.  We'll describe the item.  Of course, it's going to be an erotic item, Opie. 
[00:56:30]  The contestants then have to guess the manufacturer's retail price of the item up for bid.  The closest will win.  Without going over.  Are we playing those rules?  Nah, just closest.  Oh, God.  Pussy rules.  Well, if they both go over, then, you know, we want to move the game along.  Yeah, okay.  Closest then, even if you're over.  My God.  What's the first item we're playing for?  Oh, B, if I could get the first item. 
[00:57:00]  No, I mean the prize.  Yeah, what is the prize that the people are competing for?  How about a pair of tickets to the Jerry Red Wilson Comedy Benefit, okay?  Featuring Jim Brewer, Louis Black, Adam Farrar, and a bunch of other very, very funny people.  It's happening Tuesday at Town Hall in Times Square.  A lot of us are going down to that show, by the way.  Get your tickets through Ticketmaster, okay?  Right.  Let's go to Jackie.  Let's get our contestants first.  Sure.  Jackie.  Hi.  First of all, do you want these tickets for the comedy show?  I would prefer something else about this, not our ticket. 
[00:57:30]  Uh, what?  What?  I'm not really a comedic person.  You sound like a little ball of laughs.  Where are you from?  Queens.  No, you got a wacky accent.  That's not a Queens accent.  What country are you from?  I'm not telling you, the islands.  That's an Irish accent?  Islands.  Oh, she's from the islands.  The islands.  You sound like you just boated out of Serbia.  Very funny.  All right, so you don't want the comedy show tickets? 
[00:58:00]  Sure, I go.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We want people that want to go to this benefit because it's a hot ticket.  Yeah, she doesn't seem like she's having fun.  We'll let her play in the next one here.  TJ.  How you doing, guys?  You want to win the tickets, right?  Absolutely.  To see Brew and the gang this Tuesday, you could go?  Definitely.  All right.  Where are you from, TJ?  I'm from Queens.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on the line, okay?  Flushing.  Flushing.  Okay.

[01:00:00]  The first item up for vid, the pleasure swing.  See it in action in the movie Supermodel 2, then try it in your own home.  Special construction gives you easy access to every part of your lover's body as she sits  comfortably suspended from the ceiling.  And the freedom of motion is fantastic.  Attaches easily to the ceiling, removes in seconds, includes instruction and hardware.  It's the pleasure swing.  T.J., everybody hear that?  Yeah, got it.  All right.  T.J., we should tell people, too, this is the same swing that Tommy Lee uses in his house. 
[01:00:30]  Yes, he loves this one.  And this also comes with a book of excuses so when her mother comes over, you can explain  why she's such a whore.  It's a planter.  The pleasure swing.  T.J., you are first.  What's your bid?  I would like to bid $75.  $75 for the pleasure swing from T.J.  Eddie, it's to you.  $179. 
[01:01:00]  $179.  All right.  And finally, Dave.  Dave?  $180.  $180.  Oh, he's pulling that.  Oh, that price is right crap right away.  My God.  Dave.  Damn.  Well, the pleasure swing.  Manufacturer's suggested retail price, $79.95.  T.J., with a $75 price, is the winner.  Hey!  That's a winner.  Do I get the swing, too?  Oh, no.

Hold on.  All right.  Cool.  Don't go anywhere.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim.  Yeah.  You want to win a year's membership to MafiaMob.com?  What is MafiaMob.com?  It's a really cool website that Anthony's really into.  Yeah.  You go there and you join a crime family and try to work your way up.  My computer probably wasn't fast enough for that either.  No.  It's web-based.  It's cool. 
[01:03:00]  It doesn't have to be fast.  What the hell?  All right.  Okay.  You got a chance to win $1,000 if you go to MafiaMob.com, too.  So you got to whack a gun.  Tim, where are you calling from?  Middletown, New Jersey.  All right.  Right on.  Hold on.  Thanks.  Actually, Tim, stay right there.  Let's go to Eric from New York City.  No, this is Eric.

[01:03:30]  Anthony, are you ready with the next item?  Yes, gentlemen.  Listen closely to this next item up for a bit and try to get as close to the price as possible.  You need your music.  I know.  I'm just explaining to them.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's the newlywed game.  Where's the strangest place you ever had Whoopi?  In Dubai.  Remember that old gag?  That old gag.  Okay.  Here we go.  All right.  The first item, second item up for bed for our new contestants. 
[01:04:00]  It's the Super Stretch Senso Vagina.  The Super Stretch Senso Vagina.  Fits like a glove.  Slip into the most exquisitely textured silicone sleeve imaginable.  This tight, ultra-soft, tempting pink vag stretches to fit any man for non-stop heart-pounding excitement.  It's the Super Stretch Senso Vagina.  Thank you, Johnny Olson.  Can you tell us anything more about it?  A tight and tempting vag stretches to fit any size. 
[01:04:30]  Ultra-soft silicone rib passage that stretches to fit.  Doesn't have a face on it?  No.  It looks like a bent-over troll with a big hole in it.  And as a special bonus, I think if you come within $5 of the price, we should throw in a year's supply of Prozac to pull you out of the depression.  It should put you in.  Jim Norton, everyone.  All right.  David, to you.  Do you have a bid?  $35. 
[01:05:00]  $35.  Okay.  Eric from New York City.  $19.95.  $19.95 for the Super Stretch Senso Vagina.  And finally, Tim.  $25.  $25.  $25.  All right.  Hold on.  Tell Sticky that Eric said $19.95.  And okay, he's got it.  Anthony, what is the price of the item?  The Super Stretch Senso Vagina retails for $24.95.  Whoa.  $24.95. 
[01:05:30]  Tim was five cents away.  Yes.  Do I get the Prozac or what?  Yeah, we'll throw in the Prozac and you've got a year's membership to MafiaMob.com.  Have you ever used a plastic Vag?  Not personally, no.  Be honest.  No, sorry.  It's nice.  No one's ever...  I bet it is, Tom.  I have, actually.  Do you have it?  Yeah, no lie.  Andrew bought me one.  Why is it nice?  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  You just feel kind of stupid doing it, but when you're done, you're like, yeah, it's kind  of fun.  Well, it adds an extra special thing to jacking.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And you wouldn't go out of your way to do it.  And then once you use it once, you don't want to clean it, so you throw it away.  No, I...  But I would never want to use anything like that, just in case I get dropped dead of a  heart attack and that's going to find me.  I would use the last, like, nerves that are still alive to pull that off, screw the phone  or call a 911.  911, just try to get that thrown out the window.  See, I'm just the opposite.  Some old lady walking by who's...  You'd want to be found with something attached to your junk. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, with an open, open, open pictures of my family next to me.  Just...  Not that I would want to do that, but just to make them for the rest of their lives go.  What happened?  I dressed them for Pover League growing up.  All right.  Well, everyone, hold on.  You all win something, but Tim, you got the year membership to MafiaMob.com.  Awesome.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Ben, what else do we have to give away as we go through some of our prizes here?  That was it?  Oh, yeah.  Do you want to do some more Brewer tickets? 
[01:07:00]  Lots of stuff.  Lots of those.  Lots of what?  Lots of what we just gave away.  All right.  All right.  Know what we'll do?  All right.  Hey, Chris.  Wow.  Chris.  Yo.  You're back in, okay?  Okay.  Can you go to the comedy show this Tuesday?  Yeah.  All right, because the winner will decide what he wants, whether it's the membership to MafiaMob.com  or the comedy tickets, okay?  Cool.  Where are you calling from?  New Jersey.  All right.  Hold on, all right?  All right.  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  All right. 
[01:07:30]  I want to play for the Mafia thing.  Okay.  That's fine.  Where are you calling from?  Middletown, New York.  Okay, hold on the line, okay?  All right.  And finally, Roy.  Roy, what's going on?  Hey, Roy.  Hey, wow.  Roy.  Yeah.  You want in?  You can either win the MafiaMob.com thing or the comedy tickets.  The comedy tickets.  Okay, hold on the line.  You're in, too.  Where are you from, Roy?  Staten Island.  All right.  There's Roy from Staten Island.  We have Jeff from Middletown.  Yes. 
[01:08:00]  And Chris from New Jersey.  Everyone's there, Chris?  Yes.  Jeff?  Yep.  Roy?  Yeah.  Okay.  Are you ready, Anthony, for the next item?  Of course.  Hey, which one is that?  God, this must be old.  Petler, here he slept your face.  What is that?  What is that one, Rick? 
[01:08:30]  The GE College Bowl.  Oh, my God.  The GE College.  That isn't even a game.  Oh.  I wanted something we could get.  Hold on.  Let me try another one.  Turn that radio down, you jackasses.  Oh, please.  Everyone knows Match Game.  Match Game 76 with your host, Gene Rayburn.  With that wacky microphone.  With the stars.  Remember the microphone?  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  How's that for a topper?  Ho, ho.  All right. 
[01:09:00]  Let's play the Erotic Price is Right.  Someone's got to turn down their radio.  If you guys don't turn down those radios, I swear to God.  No, that ain't Jeff.  I know that.  Not Chris.  Roy.  Yes.  Jackass.  Turn down that goddamn radio.  I'm in there.  Whoa.  No, just turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  It's like a 40-second delay, man.  It's just going to screw you up.  It's off.  All right.  Listen to Anthony.  Here we go.  Here it is.  The next item up for bid.  The Big Shot.  Mr. Big Shot.  The ultimate jacking machine.  For pure, sensual gratification. 
[01:09:30]  The pink latex sleeve gently strokes you and pulls you.  The vacuum suction bulb gives pulsing ecstasy.  The sleeve and ribs that feel like fingers moving up and down your junk.  An internal vibrating egg and piston give you up and down stroking and suction with variable  speed and power, plus multi-speed vibes at the head of your junk.  It uses 4C and two AA batteries not included.  It's Mr. Big Shot.  The ultimate jacking machine.  Oh, my God.  Wasn't that the last item? 
[01:10:00]  No, this one's a little better.  This is a mechanical one.  The other one was just a plain old sleeve, and this one has some motion.  Moving parts, Toby.  Okay.  This one comes with no batteries, but there is a fold-out bullseye.  Anthony, does this one have a head attached?  No, this is just a big cylinder-looking thing with some moving parts on it.  Looks like something that lifts up the back of a dump truck.  Oh, wow.  Big hydraulic thing. 
[01:10:30]  All right, let's get some bids.  Chris, it's to you from Jersey.  I'll say $45.  $45.  All right.  Jeff?  This thing sounds pretty sophisticated.  I'll go $69.95.  $69.95 for Jeff from Middletown.  And Roy?  $39.99.  $39.99?  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  All right.  The manufacturer's suggested retail price, $99.95.  An expensive piece of jacking machinery, $99.95. 
[01:11:00]  Which makes Jeff the winner from Middletown.  Yeah, from Middletown.  That's a winner.  Jeff, would you ever use something like Mr. Big Shot, the ultimate jacking machine?  No, I don't think I can afford the batteries for it.  It's too much of a pot to buy to drain, you know?  Come on, man.  Dump your girlfriend and improve your aim.  All right, Jeff.  You're the winner.  Everyone stay on hold.  We've got something for everybody, okay?  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:11:30]  There they go.  Chris, Jeff, and Roy.  Do you have one more good one there, Anthony?  Yes, we're getting that now.  Something I think Rick might enjoy.  Okay, let's get some contestants.  Kenny.  Yo.  You want to win MafiaMob.com or the comedy tickets?  You got any Rick Springfield tickets?  Yeah, I'll go for the comedy.  All right, cool.  Where are you calling from?

We got Frank from Jersey.  We have Jason from Jersey City.  Jason?  Yes.  Okay.  And finally, Kenny from Jersey as well. 
[01:12:30]  Are you guys ready?  Ready to go.  Ready.  All right, Anthony, let me get to your music.  Hey.  I think that's hard start.  Everything's hard start.  What is this one?  Norton, you got a guess?  What is this one?  What is this one?  It's kind of new.  It's kind of electronic-y sounding, so it's probably the 80s. 
[01:13:00]  What is it?  Wait, stinky nose?  Tic-tac-toe.  Tic-tac-toe.  He got it.  It's tic-tac-toe.  Rick's calling him a fag.  Because he knows tic-tac-toe, but seven guys in a fag.  All right, Anthony, describe the next item.  All right, the next item up for bid, Shawn Michaels Super C. 
[01:13:30]  Shawn Michaels Super Ock.  It's 11 inches of manly meat.  Wait, wait, wait.  Shawn Michaels with a WWF?  No, it's just, I guess it's a porn star.  All right.  Shawn Michaels Super Ock.  Molded from Shawn's own giant junk,  this cocoa-colored dong measures a whopping 11 inches high  and two and a quarter inches thick.  The suction cup base allows for plenty of hands-free action. 
[01:14:00]  And overall design is so lifelike,  you'll swear you're with the man himself.  A month for phallus fans.  It's Shawn Michaels Super Ock.  11 inches of manly meat.  And what, do you stick it to, like, a hard surface  and then the lady jumps aboard?  Oh, you can plunge your toilet with it  with the suction cup on the sides of this damn thing.  Oh, my God.  If you're going to use it on your woman,  you better go out to the garage  and grab a crowbar and a mallet.  Look at this thing.  It looks like a Rudy from the Cosby kid's arm 
[01:14:30]  clutching an apple.  Look at that thing.  Wasn't that in the movie Chocolat?  Chocolat?  That's a Chocolat.  Shawn Michaels Super Ock.  Well, Frank, it's to you.  Oh, Jesus.  I'll say $35.  All right.  $35.  $35.  For Shawn Michaels C. 
[01:15:00]  Jason from Jersey City.  Super C.  Yeah, that depends.  Metal or plastic?  I'm just posting your chops.  I couldn't possibly give you an answer.  I'd go with $49.99.  $49.99.  And finally, Kenny.  Kenny, what's your bid for Shawn Michaels Super Ock?  I'm going to say $34.  Oh, you bastard.  It's going lower than Frank's by a dollar,  that underhanded goddamn thing 
[01:15:30]  that they do on the Price is Right.  Well, the manufacturer's suggested retail price  of Shawn Michaels' 11 1⁄2 inches of manly meat Super Ock,  $39.95.  Meaning Frank is the winner.  You went the wrong way, Kenny.  That's a winner.  All right, Frank.  You either have the membership to MafiaMob.com  or the comedy tickets.  I'll take those tickets.  And everyone stay on hold.  We'll give you all something, okay?  Nice.  Thanks, guys. 
[01:16:00]  The super junk is also very convenient  if you have an infant who is two-thin'.  Imagine the family comes over and looks in the little crib  and the kid's gnawing on that thing.  She just can't get enough of it.  If you've got a really good item, we can play one more.  Wah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Let's see.  Which one, Ben?  This one's funny.  How was that, man?  Cyber Sucker.  That one's a good...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we got...  All right, let me get the contestants 
[01:16:30]  while you guys figure it out.  Willie!  Yeah, what's up, brother?  You can use the comedy tickets  or the membership to MafiaMob.com?  MafiaMob.com.  All right, it'll be up to you.  Where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Queens.  All right, hold on.  All right, buddy?  All right, brother.  Cool.  Let's go to Monique, our first lady.  Monique.  Hey, guys.  Long time, no see.  Oh, it's you.  What's going on?  How you doing?  This is the phone lady, right?  Yeah.  Anthony, you remember Monique?  Who could forget Monique?  Norm, did you know what Monique did  for our radio show?  No, no, no.  What?  One day, we were discussing... 
[01:17:00]  We were discussing if a cell phone  could be answered from inside a...  No, it would receive a call.  It would receive a call.  It would ring.  And who would ring?  From inside a...  So we put it somewhere.  Wow.  Somewhere on her person or...  Taco-like.  Right.  Put it in something taco  and we tried to make the phone ring.  Who called?  The Fulton Fish Market?  Hey, hey.  Sorry.  Hey, Monique, what happened?  The phone did not ring, right? 
[01:17:30]  That's right.  It's an unlisted number.  Yeah, it didn't work.  But she was able to, you know,  take the whole phone.  Would you come down  and try it with a VCR?  Not that big.  Monique, where are you calling from again?  The Bronx.  And how's Big Daddy doing?  He's all right.  See, I remember this stuff.  Big Daddy's in the joint.  Yeah.  For a very long time.  Really?  Two more years.  Two more years.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on, all right?  Okay.  Here goes Monique.  And Rodney.  Yo, what's up?  What's up, buddy? 
[01:18:00]  You could...  Hey, huh?  You could use the comedy tickets  or the membership to MafiaMob.com?  Oh, yeah, definitely the tickets.  All right, where are you calling from?  Jersey.  All right, cool.  Hold on, all right?  And we got Monique from the Bronx  and Willie from Queens.  You guys all there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Here they are for the last round  of erotic Price is Right.  Some great, uh, great products today.  How are you doing a little bit?  I'm learning a lot.  Well, Anthony, let me play  the Price is Right music for you.  Oh, okay. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, this is card shots.  I just finally got it.  They all sound the same in the 80s.  They all have that wacky synthesized thing.  All right, everyone.  Everyone be right back to me.  Oh, my God.  Who's talking?  Everyone be quiet, all right?  All right, brother.  Here goes Anthony to describe the item.  Opie, the final item up for bid  is CyberSuff.  CyberSuff.  Coming to the next millennium 
[01:19:00]  with CyberSkin.  This amazing new material  scientifically reproduces  the feeling of real smooth  feminine skin.  CyberSuff has soft pink  kissable lips  that stay closed  until you press them open  for the perfect  deep throat experience.  Virtual touch textures  feels like the real mouth  for the ultimate  in sexual pleasure.  Lube sample included  for sensual vibes  used to double A batteries  not included.  It's the CyberSuff.  Now, this one comes with a...  It's the mouth  without the annoying voice box. 
[01:19:30]  This is hysterical  because it's just  the mouth and nose  and cheeks  like it's been gouged  from a woman.  Let me see.  Look at this thing.  Oh, my God.  It's her face  without the eyes  or anything.  That's pretty creepy.  There's not even  a head top to it, is there?  It doesn't talk.  It has no eyes,  no forehead,  no chin, really,  just the lips  and the nose.  They cut out  all unnecessary parts.  It's probably just  a mouth and a Yankee hat on it.  I'm having a Yankee hat. 
[01:20:00]  All right, Willie,  what's your bid?  What'd you say?  I'd give it,  I'd say about $80.  $80?  $80.  $80.  Monique, it's to you.  $59.99.  $59.99.  What?  $59.99.  $59.99.  And Rodney?  $59.99.  A jerk-off ass-ass  stupid mother-effing jerk-ass. 
[01:20:30]  Who has their radio on?  Turn the radio down.  Who has the radio on?  Who has it on?  Not me.  I know the rules.  It's not Monique.  Willie?  Is that you, Willie?  No, it ain't me.  Rodney, you had the radio on, right?  Migratory.  Who had the radio on?  God damn it,  we're not moving  until someone fesses up.  I know it was Rodney.  I told me who got the radio on.  I know it was Rodney.  It's impossible.  Rodney.  I'm going with Willie.  I think it was Willie. 
[01:21:00]  What?  No, it wasn't me.  Willie, you had the  friggin' radio on.  Oh, it ain't me.  Rodney over there.  Someone cursed  and we had a dump out.  I think it was Willie  and he's chatting  with his buddies, no less.  Rodney.  Oh, Rodney.  Ah, okay.  All right.  Willie's buddies are yelling?  Yeah.  Willie, you're out of this.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Now we have Monique and Rodney.  Right.  That's it.  Okay.  See how we deal with people like that?  Monique, would you like to change your price? 
[01:21:30]  No, I'm going to stick with it.  $59.99.  $59.99.  For the cyber hoe.  And Rodney?  Yeah.  Rodney?  From Jersey?  Your bid.  $59.99.  $39.99.  $40.  $49.99.  That'd be the one.  Well, CyberSuck.  Manufacturer's suggested retail price, $59.95.  Only off by five cents.  Monique is the winner.  That's a winner.  I said an Adam and Eve.  That's why.  Monique. 
[01:22:00]  Yes?  Could you say in a really angry voice, what'd I tell you?  What'd I tell you?  Sounds like that girl from the commercial.  The car commercial.  What'd I tell you?  That's what I sound like when I'm yelling at my kids.  All right.  Monique, you're the winner.  Thank you.  And Rodney, hold on.  We'll give you something too, all right?  All right, man.  All right.  There we go.  Jerk off Willie, whatever his name was.  Trying to lie to us.  Jerk off Willie?  I don't know what he was.  All right, we're done? 
[01:22:30]  Yes, there you go.  Erotic Price is Right.  We haven't played that in a long time.  A lot of fun.  We learn a lot about new erotic products out on the market.  Who knew Cyber Suck, Opie, with the new skin and the kissable lips?  Like, you're going to start kissing them after you're using it to Jack.  After your friend uses it.  Can I mention one name?  This name has had me giggling for 20 minutes.  What?  One of the items is called the Accommodator,  and it's a latex dong with straps that fit comfortable on your head, 
[01:23:00]  freeing you to use your hands and tongue to the greatest potential.  Yeah.  Did you see the picture?  It looked like the Heisman Trophy.  It's a chin.  It's like a dildo that goes on your chin.  It's the chin dildo.  You put it on your chin, you strap it on your head,  and whoever is riding your chin.  And it's a favorite of Pete the Engineer.  Pete loves the chin dildo.  He had a few chicks swatting on one right here in the studios one day.  Who would take you seriously if you were...  With the chin dildo?  The chin dildo.  Then you walk into the bathroom, you look in the mirror, 
[01:23:30]  and you put a bullet in your mouth.  Hello, Mr. Chin dildo?  Mr. Chin dildo.  All right, Jim Norton in studio.  I want to remind people, tomorrow on the show,  Michael from Survivor,  the guy that burned up his hands and his face and stuff.  We're going to be talking to him tomorrow.  Oh, the pig killer.  The pig killer, yes.  He's got a good story to tell.  And in just a few minutes,  Stephen Tyler and Joe Perry from Aerosmith, Anthony.  Oh, oh, oh.  O.B. and Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  This is O.R. and Y.  That is country.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's the O&H Show on 1027 WNEW.  Jim Norton in studio.  Stephen Tyler and Joe Perry calling us within a few minutes here.  Yes, new CD is out called Just Push Play.  A lot of people are screaming and yelling at us saying,  don't be pussies. 
[01:24:30]  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Hey, man.  We love Aerosmith.  We have said that on many occasions.  We didn't understand the whole Super Bowl thing,  and we'll ask them about it.  No problem.  Hey, sure.  Do we have the sound effects on the Super Bowl?  Yeah, here it is.  Oh.  There comes a day,  and I'll be the one you'll see.  It's the sun, it's the sun, it's the sun, it's the sun, it's the sun, it's the sun, it's the sun. 
[01:25:00]  Oh.  We'll ask them about that.  Okay, terrific.  We thought it was weird.  Yeah, I don't know what the vibe was there.  We can understand being on the same stage as Britney Spears.  It's something good to look at, but in sync, I don't know.  By the way, the new CD from Aerosmith is getting great reviews. 
[01:25:30]  There's some rockers on this damn thing.  So we're looking forward to that.  Also, Jim Norton's Dream Date is coming in studio in about a half hour.  Dream Date.  Jim wants to state something for the record.  Well, you can swallow over there.  Ha ha, that's bad.  We have Erin coming in.  Yeah.  Make sure they don't dump out of this, because they're getting real nervous down the hall.  What's their problem?  We're just talking, talking, talking. 
[01:26:00]  Erin?  Erin's the girl that talked about having these rape fantasies.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little out there.  It's a little.  It's a lot out there.  It's out there.  Definitely out there.  So Norton got involved and said, wow, I'm into that.  Right.  So these two lovebirds are going to hook up.  Why can't two consenting adults act out some fantasies?  I would never leave her.  I mean, I'd always carry her head around in a duffel bag. 
[01:26:30]  No, it's not.  Rape is not sexy.  It's the idea of dominating somebody who wants to be dominated.  It's not like actual violence is sexy.  You know, a lot of women have that fantasy.  The fantasy you're talking about, right?  Not the real act of it.  There's nothing sexy about the real act of it.  It's just.  But then when you're role-playing or something,  then some girls like this Erin girl gets really hot and excited thinking about it.  Now, Jim, Erin, very, very hot.  You saw the picture.  Yeah, very pretty girl.  Boy, is she going to be disappointed.  But she's a little wacky.  She's a little out there. 
[01:27:00]  That's right.  She was telling us her whole sexual past.  She was frustrated that she was still a virgin at, I think, 10 years old.  Wow.  What?  She should have grown up in my town.  That wouldn't have lasted.  And then she was doing stuff to herself so she would be ready for the act.  Let's just put it that way.  Prep work.  Prep work.  She was prepping the area at 10.  Wow.  So it wouldn't be a bad thing when she finally lost her virginity.  She mentioned band roll-on.  Really?  You ever see a band roll-on? 
[01:27:30]  That's so nice.  Maybe you guys should loan me the accommodator for this day.  She explained a lot of things.  I didn't hear that.  It just blew us away.  Yeah.  It was a bit twisted.  She seems to like the fantasy.  It's all about the fantasy.  It's not real.  Stephanie, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I'm a big fan of Jim.  How are you doing?  Hi, Stephanie.  How are you?  Okay, thanks.  I brought my grandmother to your New Year's Eve show.  She thought you were hysterical, too.  Grandma.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  What was she wearing?  Thank you very much.  I'm kidding.  She had big gray hair.  Anyway, she thought you were hysterical.  I have a problem, though.  What?  We went to the stress factory to see you, and they double-charged me for four people instead  of two.  Are you fat?  No.  Actually, I'm quite thin, and so is my grandmother.  Okay.  So they told me that if I can get you on the line to tell the stress factory to give  me my money back, that maybe you would help.  Yeah, because I have nothing else going on in my career.  I mean, I'm going to call for some refunds.  Anybody else?  No.  I'll see what I can do. 
[01:28:30]  Call the stress factory and explain what happened.  I did, twice.  I left seven messages.  They wouldn't call me back.  Are you attractive?  I am.  Well, is there a possibility of getting her number on hold so I can call this young lady  and help her get her money back?  Yeah.  Hold on, Stephanie.  Okay.  I'll call you.  Thank you.  Norton will help you as long as you're single.  No, she said her and her grandmother, so it wasn't like she's got a boyfriend.  That's high.  My grandmother's single.  Really?  That's high.  Look at her smile on Norton's face.  Does she earn a lot of money?  Actually, she is. 
[01:29:00]  Really?  Because I get her to write me in the will, just bang her and yell, boo, boo.  Well, she does think she's horny, and she thought you were cute.  How old is your grandma?  73.  But she looks younger.  What, does she look 65?  How much younger could she look?  She looks about 55.  Oh, that's awful.  Wait, where's your grandma?  I'm sorry?  Is your grandma with you?  No.  Hello?  She was at the Florida.  Oh.  Can we get her phone number?  Sure.  All right, hold on.  Okay.  Hold on.  Someone get this girl's grandmother on the air. 
[01:29:30]  I want to see if she would bang Norton.  Norton, would you do it?  Wow.  Come on.  You've done sick or crap.  No, I haven't.  I'd be packing a half-inch.  The elderly never excited me.  Come on.  Oh.  One time.  No, I mean, I think...  We'll fly you down to Florida for a free trip.  Free weekend.  That is so great.  You can fly me on my airline, yeah, because I get a...  I just want to know where your edge is.  Would you bang a grandma?  No.  That thinks you're hot.  She looks 55.  That's old.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Rock. 
[01:30:00]  No, I like them younger, not older.  Of course.  I mean, a few years older, yeah, but, you know...  But just, like, as a goof.  Would you do it, you know, for a goof?  What if I couldn't get a rod?  Well, we'll put you in the homo closet with Rick and his boys.  Well, we'll still get her on the air.  Yeah, absolutely.  We'll talk to her.  Why are all these pizzas showing up?  The guy from Mafia Mama.  What did he do?  So, he says, who the frig sent flowers to Opie and Anthony without my approval, first 
[01:30:30]  of all?  We were talking about that.  Someone from MafiaMom.com sent this incredible flower display.  Big thing of flowers.  And then he goes, as a token of good faith, I'd like to show our radio friends some respect.  He's given 30 points to every member that sends O&A at N.E.W. a pizza tomorrow between  3 and 7, which is today.  Make sure your Fatchamine screen names are written on the pizza box. 
[01:31:00]  By the way, I heard they like cold brews, too.  Yes.  And who sent this one?  This is Big Al?  Oh, Jesse, you're going to kill us today.  It's a gift from Big Al.  30 points to Big Al.  There you go.  Send some pie.  And who else?  Who was the first one?  We don't know.  They didn't put their screen name on the box?  It looked like Don K. 
[01:31:30]  Donkey Punch.  Don K. Punch.  Mary, what's going on?  Hey.  I wanted to talk to Norton.  He's right here.  Hi, Mary.  Hi, Norton.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good.  I'm not full of pizza.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  I heard.  I wanted to know if you could do the bit with Jenny that you did at Caroline's.  The bit with Jenny?  Yeah.  Forrest Gump.  Oh.  Well, that's...  I might have just riffed that, to be honest with you.  Oh.  Yeah.  Mary, we've got to go because we've got Joe Perry on the line.  I'm sorry, Mary.  Good luck with Grandma. 
[01:32:00]  Thank you, baby.  Norton, someone has an idea, by the way.  We want to get you to bang this grandma.  We're stalling because we're getting Joe Perry and Steven Tyler on the line.  Someone suggests, what if the old broad takes a leak, you know, oh, oh, that kind of thing?  Because we know you're into that, too.  So, it's kind of like, eh, old broad, but you're getting one of your fetishes taken care of.  Or what if she just throws a depend at you?  Yeah, maybe she can just bring her diaper out over my head.  That's not very saccharine.  Bring the diaper. 
[01:32:30]  I would love to see that, man.  I would laugh.  We can have Ada while she has his probe.  How would that be, Norton?  Okay, Sonny.  Lay down, Sonny.  I love you, boy.  I lost my water.  Dead, dead.  Tons, come on.  He's chasing Ellie Mae around the Seaman Pond, but I'm not going to get him dead.  My God.  Yeah.  We can't get your grandma on the line, Sam.  Sorry about that.  Well, the next time she's in Jersey, which is in two weeks, I'll have her call you. 
[01:33:00]  Maybe we could set something up.  I'm thinking she's a little too proper for that, but I do understand that she is very  sexually active, so she might be interested in other things.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  She's sexually active?  What might she be interested in?  Yeah, look at she.  She looks young.  What might she be interested in?  Well, you'd have to ask her.  She doesn't give me that much detail.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Make sure she calls the show next time she's in the area.  Don't worry.  I'll take care of it. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  Thanks.  Norton, what if we got a grandma in here to do the leak thing?  I don't know, man.  That might be a little too weird.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know what it would taste like.  You're getting soft.  I'm not one of old people eating drink.  You've said some sick stuff on this show.  You're getting soft.  That's how you know you're a twisted son.  What happened to you?  You're changing.  What the hell are they doing? 
[01:34:00]  Taking forever.  Well, they're talking to someone else, Anthony.  Oh, is that what it is?  You know the deal.  These guys, you know, they sit them in a room and then they're like, okay, you're talking  to Boston.  Then they're done with Boston.  Okay, you're going to be talking to Dallas next.  So I'm sure they're wrapping up an interview with someone else and they'll be with us shortly.  Should we take a break?  Are they going to be here any second?  No, say what.  Want to take a break?  Take a quick break.  All right.  When we come back, Joe Perry and Steven Tyler. 
[01:34:30]  What, Jesse?  He said that two minutes ago.  Any second now.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m.  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3. 
[01:35:00]  Don and Mike at 7.  The Don and Mike Show.  Don will simply, all he will say at the drive-thru window is, I love you.  And he will say it continuously.  He can't say anything else.  And then the goal of the game is to get the person to say, I love you back.  Hey, are you guys there?  Yeah.  Oh, hello?  Yes.  Yeah.  I love you.  Uh-huh.  I love you.  Here we go.  We love you, too.  Hey!  The Don and Mike Show.  Weeknights.  WNEW.  All right.  We're back.  Hey, that was quick. 
[01:35:30]  That was a quick little commercial break.  Quick little break.  Now, if you turned off your dial, you're stupid.  Right?  Let's see if someone is there.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Who is this?  Who's this?  No, no, no.  Who is this?  Hey, you called us, man.  Don't you F with me now.  Oh, no.  You called us, man.  Okay.  That's Steven Tyler.  This, no.  This is Jim Robards from AAF.  From AAF. 
[01:36:00]  No good, huh?  Ah, the old days.  That was pretty good.  God bless you guys, man.  Let me get your buddy on the phone here.  Joe.  Yeah, I'm here.  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Joe Perry and Steven Tyler.  Joe, how's the weather over there?  It's, uh, oh man, it's 80 and sunny.  What are you guys, right next to each other?  Yeah.  I figured that one.  No, no, no.  We're about five miles.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we got, we have to put that between each other.  Otherwise, there's an actual flux in the magnetic core of the earth.  I've heard. 
[01:36:30]  Yes.  Where are you guys hanging?  We're in Boston.  Are you?  You guys got snowed in, didn't you?  Yes, we did.  With that nor'easter?  Oh, forget it.  You know, they built it up and built it up, and when it hit, because we're on the ocean  here, it was like, you know, a whiz hole in the snow.  It was like snow.  Now, they told us the same thing.  They said New York was going to get slammed, and we bought it.  And then, when nothing happened, they said, yeah, but Boston's really getting slammed.  Well, we were right, but it just went a little further north.  I think the Produce Company of America was behind all this, because they knew people were 
[01:37:00]  going to go, you know, rip the shelves clean.  Bread and milk for some reason.  We talked about that the other day.  It's a conspiracy.  Right.  There's something going on always.  Everyone's got a hidden agenda.  Well, you know, most of the snow happened at night, so it gave everybody a chance to shovel  out, you know, like the last one was...  Who's shoveling at night, Joe?  Are you out there putting your snow at night?  You've got to only picture this, man.  I mean, I'm only imagining that people do that.  He's out there in his underwear, but with a parka on, with his night vision goggles. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, right.  You mean that?  And a helmet shoveling snow.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can see that.  Right?  Hey, well, can we get one question out of the way, because our listeners are going to  kill us if we don't.  Okay.  First of all, you guys know we love you, right?  Oh, here we go.  Shoes dropping.  It's a Britney Spears question.  Shoes dropping.  I know you've been asked a million times, but the New York audience really hasn't heard  it.  Why NSYNC?  We understand Britney Spears at the Super Bowl, but we don't understand the NSYNC thing.  Because one wouldn't come without the other?  Oh, really? 
[01:38:00]  A package deal.  Look at that.  They were prepared for the answer.  Listen, you know, it built up over a period of a month.  And first it was, would you guys like to do it?  We said, yeah.  Then, of course, they play odds, and they tell the other band we're on, and we tell the  other band they're on.  I mean, I don't do this.  It's good cop, bad cop with them.  Right.  Then we found out them was MTV, and then we got to talking about how can we make this  better than they've ever been before, because it's very Las Vegas-y the way it's been,  right?  Right.  Hell yeah.  We suggested dropping the stage down.  They said, you know what?  We're on it. 
[01:38:30]  I said, great.  And then we suggested bringing in 5,000 people and just bringing it to the people.  Yeah.  You know, making it seem more like it's an event.  It's not an event.  I mean, like it's a rock and roll show.  Yeah, but don't you think it kind of, like, it ruins your credibility getting on stage with  those guys.  No, all it did was give them some more credibility.  You think so?  I like how Joe says.  My God.  But when Brittany was strutting in front of you guys, I saw you looking.  It was a beautiful thing.  I actually got the straight T-shirts with her.  Listen, if anybody ever told us that, you know, 20 years ago when we wrote Walk This 
[01:39:00]  Way, it would be the background for that kind of a show, it would be, no one would have  believed it.  Yeah.  You know, it was just amazing to do that.  It was kind of cool when Run DMC was doing it with you, but then when you see, like, NSYNC.  What about Nelly?  Oh, my God.  That was cool.  Nelly was great.  Nelly was cool.  They were all great.  Come on, give me a break.  It was, the entertainment value was really high.  Mary J. Blige was strutting it.  You know, it was a beautiful thing.  It worked.  The only problem we had was NSYNC, and you've got to understand, it would be tough for Ed 
[01:39:30]  and I to go on the radio and say, yeah.  And I'm sure it's cool.  I'm sure you guys got pounded, too, by your fans.  Especially before.  Really?  Beforehand.  I mean, we heard it.  But, you know, it's like, if we kept taking the hard line of, no, we're not going to do this,  we're not going to do that, where will we be, you know?  I mean, you've got to take chances.  What did your close friends say?  They said, you know, they were more concerned about our, you know, about just the pulling  it off, because they knew what a, what a, I can't, you know, be too explicit, but it's, 
[01:40:00]  McGill, it could have been.  I keep forgetting we're on the radio, but no, a lot of things could have gone wrong with  it.  So they were more keeping their fingers crossed about, you know, guitar strings breaking  or pants falling down, you know?  Yeah, well, thank God you followed that up with a kick-ass album.  Well.  I've got to tell you, we've been listening to it.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's getting great reviews.  First studio album in four years, Just Push Play.  It's out there now, and I was reading a little bit about this.  You guys produced it yourself. 
[01:40:30]  Well, us and Marty Fredrickson and Marco Hudson.  But, I mean, it seemed like you guys really had control of this one big time from the beginning  to the end.  There was nobody, there was no producer to blame anything on, you know, wake up the next day  and go, how come it sounds so bad?  I mean, it was funny to go down there sometimes in the studio and just look around and it's  just us.  Who'd you get to yell at, though?  Well, you know.  Each other.  Is that it?  That's right.  Amateurs borrow, pros steal, and we stole from all the great producers we've worked with 
[01:41:00]  in the past.  And, you know, it just looked good.  Now, what I thought was cool, you had the home studio at Joe's house, right?  Yeah.  Connected to your house or whatever.  It is in the basement.  It's literally in the basement.  It's like a basement room, a couple of basement rooms that, you know, we turned into the studio.  It's not some, like, you know, yeah, right kind of studio.  It's in the basement.  Right.  Now, what was cool, though, Anthony, they would get a version of one of the songs that would  appear on the CD and they would burn it to CD.  And then you guys rented just a regular car with a regular car stereo. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And then they would play that version on the car stereo to see how it would sound in a car.  You guys sound like everybody that's ever had a van because you would just do that.  You put it on cassette.  And I remember doing that myself.  You run out of the studio and go to the car and listen.  Yeah, it's muddy, man.  We've got to go back.  And then you go back and tweak it.  Well, you know, most people listen.  We had to figure out how much to put on it so it wouldn't blow everybody's speakers out.  Yeah.  Well, listen, most people listening in the car are on headphones. 
[01:42:00]  So we listened to all the mixes and everything on headphones and we did that.  We rented, you know, had a couple of different rented cars and just kept on, you know, making  sure it was right.  That sounds good, man.  Thank you.  What about the Napster thing?  Where do you guys stand on that?  It doesn't look like they're going to be around anyway, but what was your guys' take on the  whole thing?  Well, if you spend a year in a studio writing something, you know, and we are in a business, 
[01:42:30]  you're selling it, you want people to buy it, if they hear it on the radio for free,  you know, we just ask people to buy it.  If they don't want it, let them download it.  But it kind of, you know, Liv is marrying this guy from Space Hog.  I forgot his name.  I love Space Hog, by the way.  Right?  Yeah.  That's a great band from...  Royston.  And, you know, his band put a new record out and it's on Napster now.  What if they lose 100,000 whacks from that?  Or, you know, if they lose 100,000 sales on it, their label may... 
[01:43:00]  You never know.  You know what I mean?  It's all about that.  Uh-huh.  Have you guys downloaded from Napster yourself?  I have.  I mean, I'm going to miss it.  I'm going to miss being able to get all the, like, weird old stuff and different mixes.  You can't hear what people are interested in, but it's really...  I mean, they should figure something out and fast because it's...  I mean, music fans are going to miss it, but it's not right that it's for free, you know? 
[01:43:30]  Well, do you think Lars shot himself in the foot really taking a stance on it like he did?  It kind of ruined his credibility.  I don't know.  What do you think in the media?  I mean, what do you guys think about that?  I think if you have your opinion about it like you guys do, you let the scumbag lawyers handle the whole thing  and you keep yourself out of the mix.  I think Lars putting himself out there and really coming out against this made him look like a hypocrite  from the times when Metallica was saying, hey, you know, bring recorders to our shows.  You know, we don't care. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  Well, that's a different thing.  We love that as well.  Yeah.  That's fine, you know, but it's, you know, it's just all going to come to a real fast head  as soon as the DVDs get out there and you can download that.  When the movie industry hears about it, forget about it.  You know what we were just watching?  We won't be asking that question.  It's like, you know, can I just, can I have a direct in to your bank account and download that?  It's called cash sharing, Steven.  Wow, sharing.  Wouldn't that be funny?  You go to your bank account and it's like, hey, wait a minute, there's five grand minutes  and you're like, no, it's just some download. 
[01:44:30]  No, people are sharing my money.  They're sharing my money.  Steven, it's funny you mention that because we were watching Castaway on our computers before the show.  Before the show, downloaded Castaway.  Wow.  Brand new movies, not even out on video, of course.  And this stuff is out there if you know where to find it.  And I don't think any lawyer or any judge is going to really put a stop to this.  They'll put a stop to the ones that are out there.  But as far as the underground ones, there's no way.  People will be able to do this.  Listen, they haven't been able to stop it in 30 years.  People have always come to the shows and bootlegged or they'll bootleg off the radio. 
[01:45:00]  I mean, people have been doing it forever.  But I think most people, if they can go someplace on the Internet and pay, they would just as soon do that.  You know, and anybody I talk to says, I don't mind paying some kind of a monthly fee or something to be able to get it and have it be really good quality, too.  That's the other thing.  I mean, you know, half the stuff on Napster is real sheiss, you know.  Yeah, it's crap.  Just the quality of it.  But, you know, kids don't care about that. 
[01:45:30]  I mean, if it's a good song, they'll play it and play it over and over again.  But they've got to figure something out really fast.  Hey, guys, we've got Jim Norton in the studio.  He's a local comedian.  He kicks ass.  He wanted to ask you something.  Yeah, you guys, I had a quick question for you, just out of curiosity.  At least at one point when you were working with Britney Spears, was there the temptation to get a hanky with some chloroform and throw it in a van?  To reach out and touch someone?  Thank you with chloroform.  My God. 
[01:46:00]  What do you do when you look at that and it's a friggin' kid?  You know what I mean?  No, really.  Well, there you go.  As soon as you talk to her.  I mean, she's a sweet kid, you know what I mean?  But she's a kid.  I mean, I have two boys that are older than her sons, you know, and even, I mean, you know, I mean.  I don't know, man.  When we were offline, in other words, we had earpieces in and we were talking into the microphones when we were doing our rehearsals.  Yeah.  And the day of the show, there's 80,000 people in the stands and there's one button that you hit, which cancels it from going out to La La Land. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-huh.  And it was kept inside and we were all talking on the microphones, testing, one, two, three.  And some of the jokes that were flying around and the limericks, there once was a man from Kent who had one so long that it bent.  To say he was in trouble, he started going to double instead of coming, he went.  I mean, this stuff was flying and it was hilarious.  So I'm not sure about how young everybody is.  Well, it's not that, no, that's not the point.  The point, I mean, you wrote some of your best limericks when you were 19, Steven.  You know?  But it doesn't mean that, you know, there is that other side of it. 
[01:47:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a kid, but put an ass on that kid.  Yeah, you know.  And then, Steven, you've got your own problems, you know, with that daughter of yours.  Yeah.  Yep, yep, yep.  Well, she'll be legal in a short while.  She's still not legal?  No, no, but, you know, you're going to tell me.  Yeah.  Steven, is there anything about Mia and Liv?  Hi, Mia.  Hi, Liv.  I get in big trouble.  I don't say that.  Are they in New York?  Oh, yeah.  Mia lives in New York.  She lives on the street. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, give me a dress out.  And her phone number is...  There's someone in the studio that knows where she lives.  Oh.  I'm not even going to give this tree.  We do know that.  What's his name?  I'll kick his ass.  He's watching her.  Hey, you guys, are you going to reschedule that CD signing?  You know, yeah.  We're going to go in next week and do this thing.  We have a pretty open schedule next week.  What is it?  We're talking about Friday.  Next Friday in New York City?  You guys will know as soon as we know. 
[01:48:00]  Thursday's rehearsal, Saturday Night Live.  Friday's a day off.  Saturday's Saturday Night Live, obviously.  Sunday is...  Day off?  We get a day off.  Stephen, church.  Yeah, right.  Church.  I'm so sorry.  And then Monday is Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Tuesday is Letterman.  Yeah, by the way, congratulations.  That's so cool.  Thank you.  Are you looking forward to it?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's a good thing.  It should be good.  It's a good thing.  Yeah.  Well, when are you going to come in live?  You know, we had a blast at AAF when you guys came in. 
[01:48:30]  Spun some tunes.  We had some fun.  And then that was the last we saw you guys.  Where are you guys...  Where's your studio?  We're at NEW in New York City now, right?  Yeah.  Midtown.  Yeah.  We'd come down and visit Scott Muni.  I remember when I changed Stephen's diapers.  Oh, God.  Back in the old days.  Scott Muni.  Is he still on?  He's at Q104 now.  He does a one-hour show for Q104.  We love the old curmudgeon.  He was a very cool to us when we got here.  Yep.  Tour plans.  Everyone's asking about that. 
[01:49:00]  We hit the road in June, July.  We're going to do every shed in America.  Holy shed.  Maybe twice.  Holy shed.  You know, and then maybe twice, and then we'll see what happens from there.  All right.  I think we've got to let you guys go.  But Just Push Play, it's out.  It's getting great reviews.  Guys, we want to play another song off the disc.  Give us one.  We'll play whatever you want.  Except for Jaded.  We heard Jaded, and I like that.  But what?  The title track.  Just Push Play.  Okay.  As we say goodbye to you guys, we'll play that, all right? 
[01:49:30]  Bingo.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Thanks, man.  Try to make it in sometime when you're in New York, goddammit.  All right.  We'll let you know about the in-store thing.  All right.  Please do.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Steven Tyler and Joe Perry of Aerosmith Anthony.  There they go.  Here's the title track from Just Push Play.  It's Aerosmith on WNAW.  Hey, Andrew.  What's up?  Yeah.  It's Mary Jane Rottencotch.  What are you talking about?  Well, a month ago, I was listening to you guys, and it was like, oh, Aerosmith, oh, 
[01:50:00]  Aerosmith, oh, Aerosmith, and do you know that it's going to be a ring?  Andrew.  Yeah.  You're over-modulating, so I have no idea what you just said.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Pull the phone away from your mouth.  Oh, I'll start again.  Go ahead.  After the Super Bowl, I listened to you guys, and you were dissing on Aerosmith, and you  were saying what pussies they are, that they're saying with NSYNC, and now is kiss-pootie  time.  Andrew.  Yeah.  Were you listening to the same interview?  Yes, I was.  We brought it up with them. 
[01:50:30]  I know you brought it up.  And they explained themselves, and we even said, we thought you looked kind of silly  with NSYNC on stage.  I know that.  It ruined their credibility.  It ruined their credibility.  They mentioned that.  We mentioned it.  It ruined their credibility.  They just did.  And did you hear their answer?  Yeah.  And what did you...  Wait, wait.  What did you get out of their answer?  What did you get out of that?  I got that they were happy with it.  You did?  Yeah.  You didn't get that underlying thing, that maybe there was a little politics work in 
[01:51:00]  there, that it was best that they do it for other reasons, and...  No, I didn't get that.  You didn't get that?  That's exactly what they...  See, you listen to half an ear, you effing tool.  That's exactly what they said.  Could he have had worse quality on that call?  How about this, too?  Let's put two and two together.  NSYNC, huge on MTV.  Aerosmith, new album out.  They want to be on MTV, don't they?  Videos.  MTV put on the Super Bowl halftime show.  You think if MTV approaches Aerosmith and goes, you know, hey, we'd like to have you guys 
[01:51:30]  do the Super Bowl thing, and they say no, don't you think they might have a little trouble  getting their new videos played for their album on MTV, you effing tool, read between  the lines, schmuck ass, F, S, tennis.  Guys, come on.  You guys ripped them a new A-hole with that day after the Super Bowl, and you guys go ahead  and come back to bed like this today?  All right.  Come on.  And if they would have said, I think it was great, and we had a great time, and NSYNC's  a great band, then shouldn't we have laid into them? 
[01:52:00]  You should have laid into them.  You weren't satisfied with their NSYNC?  Gentlemen, gentlemen, you should have laid into them anyway.  Come on.  We brought it up.  We laid into them.  We said we didn't understand.  We said we're big fans, but, and they went, uh-oh, what is this about?  And we said, well, the NSYNC thing.  We can understand Britney because she's hot.  You heard the interview.  I made my point.  I'm done.  Gentlemen, please.  I'm so disappointed.  Good.  Thanks, Dennis.  Be disappointed.  That's not what it was.  Go F.  We gave them a chance to answer, and they answered.  It's called politics.  They gave an explanation.  What are we supposed to do after that? 
[01:52:30]  Hey, Dick, you were with NSYNC, Dick.  Yeah, we brought it up.  Yeah, yeah, you know, it's kind of a thing.  You know, we were approached on TV, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, but NSYNC, Dick.  I mean, what do you want?  God, we rip people apart on an almost daily basis.  Unbelievable.  Well, we have Jim Norton, and this fantasy girl is waiting to come into the studio.  You know, how do we set this up? 
[01:53:00]  We've got to be very careful.  Her name is Erin.  She called the other day.  Yeah, she's the girl that was talking about her sexual activities through the years.  Hour up fantasies.  Yeah, one of them is a rape fantasy that, quite frankly, we really don't understand to this day.  Look, a lot of people are getting confused.  When we talk about this, what are we, endorsing rape?  No, you jackasses.  Especially those women from now.  We're not endorsing it.  Not saying it's a good thing. 
[01:53:30]  Of course it's horrible.  But the truth of the matter is there's some women out there that have these fantasies.  It doesn't mean they want to be attacked.  In fact, they have a fantasy about this.  And they were calling like crazy the other day.  It's out there.  What are you going to do?  Try to tell us it's not?  And then Norton said he's into that.  Sure, he's into it.  But then he's accommodating a woman that has that kind of fantasy.  You want to talk about backpedaling?  Then Norton backpedaled a little bit and said, well, it's not the actual act of rape,  but it's more of a dominant thing.  It's a role play.  Because the idea is, you know, the real act of rape, it wouldn't turn me on. 
[01:54:00]  And I'm a little pervert, but it wouldn't turn me on to see somebody really kicking and screaming.  Of course not.  How many times can you enjoy that?  Not what we're...  How many times?  It's not even what we're getting at.  Jackasses.  All right.  So then Erin talked to Jim Norton on the phone, and it seemed like we had a little love connection.  Yes.  Their minds are kind of in the same place.  She's looking for something a little different, and Jim is willing to do...  Do it with someone who only put me in prison. 
[01:54:30]  Right.  So we're going to open the door.  That's wonderful.  She has never met you.  No, but why don't you go running?  Oh, well, hold on a second.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey.  Turn down your radio and say what you have to say.  What I have to say is that, you know, these guys did some very talented people, and they  can't do it.  What?  What?  Who?  What?  When?  When?  You guys come on the radio and you make fun of Aerosmith for performing with NSYNC, who  are five talented people. 
[01:55:00]  You guys can't go on stage and do that.  Jeff, seriously, do me a favor, because we'll be here in two years, okay?  In two years, you call up when NSYNC is still as popular as they are today.  They are called Flavor of the Month.  Aerosmith's been around for like 20-something years.  They're still rocking their latest CD.  I'm an Aerosmith fan, too.  But I'm just saying, there's a huge difference here.  Aerosmith's latest CD getting great, great reviews and play all over the place.  This is a band that's been around forever through drug abuse and all sorts of crap, okay? 
[01:55:30]  NSYNC will not be around.  I'll give them maybe another year.  Tops.  Jeff.  Tops.  You're an NSYNC fan?  You have a problem with that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a problem with a guy being an NSYNC fan.  It's a little odd.  You've got a problem with that?  Yeah.  Oh, well, you're going to kick my ass.  No, why would I want to do that?  That's just a waste of my time.  NSYNC?  Are you a gay man?  Not at all.  Explain to me why NSYNC rocks.  Yeah.  Do you like their dancing? 
[01:56:00]  Is that it?  What do you like about it?  Do you like their highlights?  Do you like the tough NSYNC guy?  The fat one?  Which one do you like?  The clothes?  Do you like the NSYNC guy that looks like he's in his 30s?  Do you like how they shape their beards?  Yeah.  Where's time for that crap?  And when they were talking before about the closet contest, tell the truth.  Did you get a little spot in the front of your undershorts?  No, actually, I missed that part.  All right.  But you like NSYNC.  Yeah, I do.  Explain why.  What do you like about him?  It's decent music.  I like any kind of music.  I'm a very big person into music. 
[01:56:30]  Isn't it kind of mushy, kind of like girly type music?  I'm trying to understand.  Jeff, you have to be one of the only guys that goes to the concert.  Jesse's going rock.  I love NSYNC.  See, the thing is, is that they're talented.  We know how this is going to end.  They're talented.  The Chris Rock joke about, we've all saw new kids on the block.  We know how this is going to end.  I'm not gay.  I throw boxers at the stage. 
[01:57:00]  Jeff, you don't have much of an argument.  We're giving you a chance.  He just likes the music.  You say we're pussies and you're pissed off at us.  I didn't say you were pussies.  Well, explain why NSYNC rocks.  We'd like to get the other side of a story on this show.  Huh?  Go.  Tell us.  Go with what?  It's just I said I like them.  And it's talented people.  Why do I like them?  Yeah.  Because it's just something I happen to get into.  I can sing.  I can do that.  And, you know, you don't have to like them. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, you can sing?  Yeah.  And you can dance like NSYNC?  Yeah, is there a problem with that?  Have you tried to do the dances that they do?  Maybe you hook up with other guys and do a band-like thing like that?  Are you trying to do that?  If the opportunity for sex itself, why not?  Do you have friends, though, that you get together with and try to throw together, like, harmonies and whatnot?  Absolutely not.  You were just dancing in front of a mirror and wondering where all your white blood cells went?  Well, I don't know.  It sounds like, well, it sounds like you're gay. 
[01:58:00]  I don't know.  You didn't really make much of an argument, Jeff.  Well, no, I think he did.  He just said, you know, it's hard to say.  I want to know why.  He said he likes it.  He just likes the music, which is fine.  Okay.  I can even deal with that.  And my biggest point is, and I say it.  Your friend's laughing at you?  Sometimes.  Your friend's got to laugh at you that you like and say it.  Oh, yes, sometimes.  Jeff, let me explain it this way, okay?  Aerosmith, all right?  If Steven Tyler or Joe Perry left the band, it would be pretty tough for the band to go on, okay? 
[01:58:30]  NSYNC, don't you think they could pretty much get rid of every single member and bring in five new guys,  and it would pretty much sound the same?  It's possible.  Yeah, of course it's possible.  That's not talent.  They're the flavor of the month.  They're the thing that's happening.  They're a studio-produced band.  Yeah, well, maybe it's right there, but the biggest point is, is you don't have to like it, but you can't do it, so don't dip it.  Oh, that's so funny. 
[01:59:00]  You know something?  It's like, yeah, I can't suck a big C either.  But you know what?  I wouldn't even want to try.  You know what I mean?  I don't know about that.  Am I going to get up and start doing the NSYNC dance, and if I can't, I shouldn't say that there are a bunch of horrible dancers and musicians?  I don't know, guys.  Sometimes listening, I think you guys are sitting there pulling each other's pods under the little radio table there. 
[01:59:30]  Keep your fantasies to yourself.  Pod?  Jeff.  Yeah, Jeff.  That got to us, really.  That's very good.  Keep your fantasies to yourself.  I haven't heard pods since I was in third grade.  I was going to say, that's good third grade humor.  Cosmo, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I love the show, man.  Thanks.  I want to talk to the guy that's on the other end, man.  Dude, you need your nads reattached, guy.  Do you go to the barbershop and want to get the same little beard and face your head like them and all that?  Do you use the same gel they use?  I can see this.  Jeff has this, like, fantasy that one day he'll be in a boy band. 
[02:00:00]  He does the dancing and the singing and has a dream of someday having all these little girls chase them around, which is great and everything.  But, Jeff, it ain't going to happen.  I'm pretty sure he stands in front of MTV with the signs up every time they come visit.  Let me make another point here.  You guys like Britney Spears, right?  We like what she looks like.  I don't listen to her songs.  I watch her videos.  I don't sit there and go, wow, this song is cool.  No, I'm like, look at that ass.  Look at the belly.  Look at the abs.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the eye.  I mean, she's a beautiful girl. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  That's what we like about Britney Spears.  She's in our spank bubble.  There you go.  That's all.  Seriously.  So what point were you going to make with that, Jeff?  Well, never mind, guys.  It's a waste of my breath.  Well, it certainly is.  Cut your losses.  It's talking to a wall.  A breath you could be blowing on another man's sack right now.  Cut your losses.  The boy band.  It's a third burglar.  The boy band thing, you know, time is running out.  That's all going to go away very, very soon.  Yeah, well, like you guys said, two years from now, I'll give you a call. 
[02:01:00]  We'll see what happens.  Oh, my God.  They will not be around, man.  They will not be around.  Maybe you'll get to replace him, Jeff.  You'll be full clean by then.  Thanks, Jeff, for trying to comment.  Yeah, all right.  You suck.  Jeff hasn't gotten, he hasn't really accepted it yet, I don't think.  No.  Wasn't he, didn't he call up earlier and say he wanted to do the bathroom thing with the  seven gay men that Rick said earlier in the show?  I think that was a good thing.  I've been saying it's very defensive. 
[02:01:30]  I got a couple phone calls and we'll bring in your dream girl.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Two things.  I'd like to tell that guy, Jeff, go play with gay Marco's Purple Grimace.  Okay.  Second, well, dude, my ex-girl used to be big time into that whole rape thing.  She used to make me leave, like, for an hour.  And I'd just come home, like, in the middle of the night or something.  And, like, and she would leave the door unlocked and I'd come in and, you know, it was rough.  It was like.  Hold on. 
[02:02:00]  I'll watch the S word.  Psycho S.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah.  But she was into being dominated.  Yeah, totally.  No, she wouldn't like.  But she would leave the door unlocked and let you go, what, leave the house for an hour?  Yeah, I'd go, like, hang out, like, you know, a couple of houses down at a friend's house  or I'd just go somewhere and stuff and then just come back whenever I wanted to.  And she would tell me that's what she wanted to do tonight.  And then I'd just come over and, like, she'd want, like, her panties ripped off and stuff  like that.  Is that how you met her?  Basically, yeah.  Yeah.  Central Park.  All right.  Thanks, Jason. 
[02:02:30]  We don't really want to joke about her.  That's not uncommon, though.  No, a lot of women are into that.  And because you trusted them.  That's why.  If women trust you and they go with that, it's part of the thing.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, yeah, I used to date this girl that we started getting a little kinky.  And she was about six feet tall and I'm about five, seven.  And she used to love her when I would, like, throw her down, rip all her panties.  And we'd turn up in sex and she'd yell, no, stop, don't.  And I thought I was part of the person.  So I would hear that my roommates were listening to the door.  They thought I was killing her. 
[02:03:00]  That is so weird.  But she would do that, like, as a part of fantasy.  I'd have to put a pole on top of her head because I was embarrassed that someone would think  I was really raping her.  And she really got into it and started screaming, no, stop, don't.  Absolutely.  For, like, a good 30 minutes.  No, stop.  And I would be like, shut up.  When would you know when she really wanted you to stop?  Did you have a safe way?  Oh, no, I got scared.  And finally I would just stop.  You know, because I would get scared because I didn't know if she was really saying no or  not.  But then she was happy in the end.  Yeah.  You got to get a safe way.  All right, Dave, thanks.  Safe way. 
[02:03:30]  You do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why they say this.  You know, they really mean no.  That way it doesn't get out of hand.  Gary, what's going on?  Oh, hey, what's going on, my friends?  Hey.  I met this chick in a bar.  We dated actually one time.  And the next time we met out, she told me to come by.  And I said, I was at my buddy's.  And I said, listen, you know, I'll be over there in a little bit.  She said, well, the key's underneath the mat.  Just come in whenever you want.  Whatever time it is, don't even call.  So I would be out.  I'd come in, you know, get some partying.  Show up at our house at 4 o'clock and just actually get the key.  She'd be down to sleep, not even up, like, a bit. 
[02:04:00]  I used to take off my clothes, wake up, smack her in the face with it, and then just  totally, totally abused her all night long.  And she liked this.  She loved it.  She used to beg me to come over.  It was insane.  I just drank that in the face.  And the only thing that scared me, ONA, was her brother was a cop.  And I was always scared, like, I'm going into this girl's house one day without a key.  You know, like, with the key underneath the mat.  If you got for business, this guy thinks I'm busted and shoots my ass.  Right.  That was the only scary thing about it, though.  But I got so tired of doing it because it became so abusive that I almost started laughing 
[02:04:30]  because it was just totally funny.  Man, all right, Gary, thank you.  All right, guys, thanks.  I want to hear from some other ladies.  Well, we'll get a few ladies on the phone.  One is right outside the door.  Jim, you think she's going to date you or what?  No.  She's never seen you.  You're not confident.  No.  You're not confident, huh?  No, I'm sure it'll be fine.  All right, well, let's open the door and let Erin in to meet Jim Norton.  Here she comes.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  Hi, Erin.  How are you?  Nice. 
[02:05:00]  All right, put the headphones on.  Yeah.  Okay.  Why'd you bring your pocketbook in?  They told me to.  Oh.  Wow.  You're having those implants taken out?  Yes.  Why is that?  I hate them.  It was the worst idea I ever had in my whole entire life.  Well, why'd you get them?  Really?  I don't know.  Some guy wanted to buy them for me, and I was a C.  I went to a D, and I wish I was a C again.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's just, you know, you get a lot of negative.  You get a lot of...  What kind of problems are you having with them?  I think they're too big.  I don't like how they're, like, you know... 
[02:05:30]  You got a nice low-cut shirt on.  You're showing them off nice.  I think they're just too big for my body.  We all disagree, Erin.  Really?  Wait, so you're the comedian?  Yeah, that's Jim Norton.  What do you think?  First impression.  He can handle it.  So, you're the pervert like me?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Huh?  You don't look as sick as I thought you would.  Really?  Everybody tells me that.  They think I'm going to look like a truck driver.  You look pretty sick, though, Norton.  Who knows who she dated before? 
[02:06:00]  He doesn't look sick enough?  What's the quick cam?  That's so people can see you.  Oh.  Yes.  Oh, I see.  Yes.  So, your first impression of Jim, he doesn't look as bad?  He, um, no, I...  Doesn't look as scary?  I thought he'd be a little older.  Uh-huh.  How old did you think?  Um, I don't know.  Maybe 40s.  I thought everyone here would be older.  A little older, like those internet commercials you hear.  Hi.  I thought we'd meet in the park. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, you're older than I thought.  Come sit next to me.  Don't meet people on the internet.  All right.  So, you have a, um, one of your little fetishes, one of your fantasies.  It's a rape fantasy.  All my fantasies.  It's the only way that I can, um, well, as I explained the other day when I was a little  girl.  Yeah.  Me and my friends used to play some really twisted games.  Um.  A little girlfriends.  Me and my little girl.  And my little boyfriend.  And your little boyfriends.  Yes. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  I mean, starting from the time I was very, very young.  Mm-hmm.  I'm talking like a little kid.  Like, I remember five years old.  When was the first wee-wee you saw?  The first wee-wee.  How old were you?  That was my, that was my little best boyfriend.  We grew up together.  We must have been like four or so.  Oh, yeah?  We used to take baths together.  Oh, you took baths together, did you?  Yeah.  And I remember once, well, I don't remember this, but, uh, his parents told the story.  But it was brought out in hypnosis one day.  No, no, no.  What happened?  We were in the bath together, and I- 
[02:07:30]  No.  Probably not.  Um, well, what, what, I'm not sure what they're going to go through there.  We were trying to-  You were trying to actually do, uh, uh, a-  What grown-ups do.  The big sex act.  We didn't really know what it was.  We were just trying to put some parts together.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  That's all you need to say about that.  And I guess his mother walked in.  I don't remember this, but she tells a story, and my parents tell the story, and they think  it's so funny.  And his mother said, what are you doing?  And we said, oh, we're just trying to get our butts off. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know what that meant, but that-  Well, that's a new term the black people are using these days.  Get your butt off.  I mean, we were like four or five years old.  Oh, my God.  Was it-  Was he hung?  Oh, I mean, that's horrible, man.  I don't know.  That is horrid.  I don't think there was actually any-  How did he even know, like, how did he even know where to start at that age?  I don't know.  We just figured, you know, I had a part that looked like it was meant for- 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, another part.  Okay.  Like Legos.  Exactly.  Like Legos.  Just like Legos.  Human Legos.  Absolutely.  Oh, blockos.  I think we need to check out her breast implants to make sure they're too big.  They are too big.  They really are too big.  Do you think they're too big?  Yeah.  Well, can we see and stuff?  You know.  Wow.  She just pulls them right out.  What a trooper.  Are those too big?  No, they're not too big.  No.  What do you think?  Not at all. 
[02:09:00]  I don't put my implants on the camera.  Oh, no.  That doesn't matter.  That thing doesn't work anyway.  Yeah, right.  It doesn't work so much.  Let me freeze that shot.  So it can't work for everybody.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Erin has made her way into the studio.  A lot of controversy over Erin and what she has to say.  Do I get to tell more perverted stories?  No.  Of course.  Well, we're taking a break now.  We'll take a quick break.  Why don't you tease one of your perverted stories?  You know what a tease is? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  You leave them wanting more.  It's a quick five seconds of the story that will make people want more.  Let me see.  Should I tell about my first threesome or the first time a guy?  First time a guy won.  There was this one guy.  The first time a guy.  Certainly can.  Okay.  Okay.  That will be the story.  We will return with the tinkling story, Opie.  Yes.  The guy that liked to be tinkled.  All right.  This is Norton. 
[02:10:00]  That's actually not.  I'm actually seeing cartoon hearts coming out of Norton's head going.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  That's actually not what he wanted me to do.  Okay.  That's the tease.  That's the tease.  Now we wait, and you tell the story when we get back.  Okay.  Fantastic.  All the enemy.  We punish ignorance.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing, O'Neal?  Good.  Yeah, I was listening to your advertisement before.  One of your sponsors on Dice Lumber. 
[02:10:30]  And I had to laugh because on Route 17 South, New Jersey, they have a branch there.  And the building right next to it is called Skinner's Nuts.  Skinner's Nuts?  I swear to God, it's right next to it.  They sell like trail mix.  And like those bagged nuts.  It's the best thing when I drive home.  I drive past Skinner's Nuts and then there's Dice Lumber.  Can't you pick up a bottle of vodka at Bunghole Liquors?  It's right across the street, I believe.  And they better not dump out of that because that's a real liquor store in Massachusetts.  Bunghole Liquors. 
[02:11:00]  Bunghole Liquors, yeah.  Because a bunghole in the liquor and beer industry is the hole in the big wooden cast that you put the plug in.  It's called a bunghole.  But we always thought Bunghole Liquors was kind of funny.  Parking in rear.  Parking in the rear at Bunghole Liquors.  Thank you, Jeff.  I love it.  All right, man.  Thanks.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, Opie and Anthony?  Hey.  Hey, listen, guys.  I got a real quick suggestion.  It's Wednesday. 
[02:11:30]  It's Whip Mount Wednesday.  Give Norton a cell phone.  Get him out of the studio.  That way when the cops show up, hold the shade, lock the door, you guys ruin the safe.  I know Norton's in heaven, man.  This must be the best for him.  All right.  Thanks, Sean.  That Dice Lumber spot was the best, man.  You guys suck.  Take care.  All right, buddy.  Bye.  Gotta love Dice.  And finally, Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Dude, I like this chick, man.  You like Gary?  Yeah, and I'm going to tell you, I'm into this stuff.  She's a freaky chick, and she doesn't look too bad.  Hey, she doesn't, man.  Hook us up.  Can I leave my number for her or something like that? 
[02:12:00]  I'm a cool guy.  I'm good looking, you know?  I think she's going to bang Norton tonight.  Ah, he's a C-blocker.  That's right.  He is a C-blocker.  Look at his eyes, bro.  Could you imagine?  Well, you probably...  Hey, Jay.  What?  You're going to ruin it.  Yeah, don't ruin it.  Aw.  You're out.  Just tell her I have AIDS, stupid.  You're out.  All right.  So what is it?  Do the guys like a good TF off of those things?  Um, yes.  No, I'm talking to Norton.  Oh.  No.  Do the guys like a good TF? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, some of them do.  I honestly...  I haven't been...  Can you say laid here?  You could say laid.  Laid is acceptable.  I have not been laid in a long time.  How long?  Um, all right.  Why am I yelling?  I don't know.  I remember the exact date was, um...  Wait, July 4th.  It was the week after July 4th.  So, July 14th.  It was July...  Are you kidding me?  No.  She's slamming down the horny goat weed as we speak.  You haven't had the pleasure of a... 
[02:13:00]  Of a man or a woman.  Man junk or anything?  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Let's get this right out in the open, Erin.  Yeah.  What are the odds that Norton does you tonight?  If you guys go out, hang out.  Tonight?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm usually not that easy.  Well, what about tonight?  What about...  You could not be easy again tomorrow.  I don't know.  Usually they have to put in, like, their three dinners or something.  Oh, all right.  How about you front him?  You front him a leg, and then breakfast, lunch, and dinner, over?  I front him? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, you front him the leg, and then...  Does brunch count as two?  You know what it is?  I think you two do very well together because of this whole fantasy thing.  Yeah, and let me tell you something about...  He'll crack you right in the face.  Norton hasn't been laid in a very long time, either, so...  I don't believe that.  Look at him.  Come on.  It's been a while.  The thing is, with me, the only way that I can climax...  Yeah.  ...is I have to picture...  Even if I'm, like, in love with the guy, I have to picture the whole incest, rape, fantasy. 
[02:14:00]  Like, I don't picture my own father or anything.  Right.  And I've never been molested.  Yeah.  But I have to think about...  Can we, like, back up?  What do you mean by incest if you're not...  Like, how does that come into play?  Like, for me to climax when I'm engaging in sexual relations...  Yeah.  Um, I have to picture, you know, like, there's certain scenes from a movie, like...  Let me think.  Something really taboo.  Oh, like that movie, Priest.  That had a great incest scene where the father was, um, doing the daughter, and the mother 
[02:14:30]  walks in and catches him.  The daughter's maybe, like...  All right, hold on.  ...13.  She's all ripe for the picking and...  Right.  Right.  Where do you find these movies?  Priest.  Anyone else hear of Priest?  They're Norton's Home movies.  There it is.  It's a little 8mm.  Wait, Steve from copymusic.com has heard of the movie Priest?  Heard of it.  Heard of it.  Didn't know that was in it, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you picture things like that in your head?  That is the only way I can climax, yes.  I have some great porno.  Really?  Yeah.  Some real taboo stuff, though, Norton?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The porno that I like is... 
[02:15:00]  I either like very young girls with very old guys, or...  I know you guys are going to be grossed out, but...  No, I don't.  ...man-on-man stuff.  All right, yeah.  Well, Rick isn't grossed out at that.  Uh-huh.  As a matter of fact, he likes seven man-on-men.  I see why...  Another thing that...  Another thing that teen doesn't help, by the way.  Teen man-on-man.  Teen man-on-man.  Teen man-on-man.  No.  But there's something about, like, the whole perverted little pedophile thing that you  like?  Yeah.  I mean, I wouldn't do anything to children.  You can leave your kids with me in their space.  Other people's jobs. 
[02:15:30]  And so you think about this in your head.  Yes.  That is the only way I can climax.  Absolutely.  Like you watch...  You get a scene from Lolita, maybe, in your head?  You ever see that movie?  Yes, I did see that movie.  That wasn't...  That was a little...  Not graphic enough.  That's a little too tame for her, right?  Okay.  I saw the new one, though.  How's the new one?  Is it Jeremy Irons or something in the new one?  Yeah, I saw the one with Jeremy Irons.  I mean, that doesn't really show anything.  Nothing that good?  No, I...  You need the real deal.  Yeah.  How about snuff films?  Um, I haven't seen any yet.  Oh, look, her eyes lit up. 
[02:16:00]  You are a sick F.  I mean, it just...  It turns me on.  Yeah.  You know...  All right, hold on.  Jason wants in on this conversation.  Jason, what's up?  Dude, it's me again.  Yeah.  All right?  She's not going to give it up tonight, okay?  This is a girl...  It's a seed blocker again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dude, I could totally get into this, Jake.  Babe, if you want, you and I could do it in a church.  All right?  What does doing it in a church have to do with anything?  What are you talking about?  Will you get busted by a freaking priest?  You are...  That's not what turns me on. 
[02:16:30]  He's not even listening to you.  You're not even hearing me.  Gabe has some info on this movie, Priest.  You're listening, but you're not hearing me.  Gabe, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up, Norton?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Yeah, the movie Priest?  Yeah.  It's this Irish movie, and it deals with incest briefly, but mostly it's about this, like,  butt-knocker priest who rides his bike around and, like, eats knob and stuff.  Yeah, well...  Can you say that again slower?  Wait, the priest is gay?  Yeah, he's a crazy guy.  I mean, that turns me on, too, but the main scene in that movie was the father, he's 
[02:17:00]  like this fat old guy, maybe, like, 55.  Yeah, that was great, man.  And the daughter, and he's on top of her, and he's on top of her, and he's...  Yeah.  My God.  Wow.  You are a little pervert.  Wait, let's go to Jane.  Jane?  Yes.  Hi, Jane.  Hi, Jane.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, Jane.  I just wanted to say a teen priest.  Oh.  I had to see it from my Deviants in the City class. 
[02:17:30]  Deviants in the City.  You've got to take a class for that?  Just walk around.  What is Deviants in the City?  It was, yeah, it was easy credit, basically.  And it's about a gay priest, and I know exactly the scene she's talking about.  The priest, basically, I believe the girl confesses, or the father confesses that he's  molesting his daughter.  Yeah.  And the priest is not allowed to say anything.  Yeah.  Because, you know, like, obviously, it's confession and whatever. 
[02:18:00]  But it's a pretty good movie, actually.  And, yeah, that scene is hot.  Yes, that scene is hot.  I have to agree.  How old is the girl on it?  I would think she's about 13, 14.  Yeah, she's about 13.  And that gets you all turned on.  And she's, like, in her little Catholic schoolgirl outfit.  Oh, yeah.  Daddy comes home early.  Yeah.  Little plaid skirt comes home from school.  Actually, she stayed home sick from school.  Yeah.  Yep.  Mommy went to work, and Daddy went to work.  What do you think of the Olsen twins?  Olsen twins reference to the day.  Oh, yeah.  You like the Olsen twins? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Too old.  They might be a little too old now.  How old are they?  Oh, well, yeah.  That's what I'm saying, too.  Do you ever put on pigtails and age plays?  You ever age plays?  Oh, yes.  I used to do that with my ex-boyfriend.  Oh, that's great.  And you put in pigtails.  Yes.  And you're the only, like, little 13-year-old with huge breasts.  He had a whole little schoolgirl out for me, and I put on the pigtails and, you know,  the stripper heels, and, you know, bend over in the kitchen, whatever.  And you're going to get spanking and get taken for turning Daddy on and walking around the 
[02:19:00]  house that way.  Yeah.  Naughty, naughty.  You, too.  Look at you, too.  Jade, anything else?  Um, no.  I just wanted to say completely agree with Erin, and she's absolutely right about getting  hot over all that stuff.  That turned you on as well?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I like it when I'm naughty, when they're like, I'm Daddy's naughty little girl.  Wow.  Yeah, if I totally have to, okay?  Naughty, naughty girl.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Taylor.  Taylor, what's up? 
[02:19:30]  Hey, my wife keeps bugging me to go out to dinner.  I was wondering if Norton and Erin could come over and watch my kids.  Hey, hey, hey.  Maybe stay for with Michael Jackson.  Mr. True Crowley, you guys should open a daycare center.  Imagine that.  A daycare.  That's funny.  Oh, that's good, Taylor.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Lauren and Erin's Kid Wrecker Center.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You mentioned the thing about this Priest movie.  A couple years ago, it was backed by Disney.  There'll be controversy about it, because it was about a gay priest. 
[02:20:00]  Priest was backed by Disney?  Yeah.  Are you sure about that?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Oh.  How about that?  I'm right.  All right.  Thank you, Jack.  Jack has some advice for Norton.  Jack, what's going on?  Oh, hey, what's up, boys?  Real quick one.  Norton?  Yes, sir.  Do you want to get in your pants tonight?  Don't shout for what I'm doing here.  Tell her you belong to Nambla, and that you're a big Roman Pulaski fan.  That is a hero.  Nice Roman Pulaski reference.  Nice.  I don't like Nambla. 
[02:20:30]  I don't like Nambla.  But Roman Pulaski, she was 13.  She was asking for it, and he was a great director.  Thank you, sir.  God bless you.  What do you think of Nambla?  I'm a big fan of Nambla.  You like the North American Man-Boy Love Association.  You know, I went on the website on my mother's computer, and she was getting these emails,  and she called me, and...  What the hell are you doing on a Nambla site?  Like, they must hate that.  Ew.  A girl.  I pose as a guy.  You know, just the whole thing kind of turns me off.  Can't help.  Can't help.  Can't help.  Can't help. 
[02:21:00]  Well, she said the boy-on-boy thing.  Yeah, and I can't have anything with boys.  None of that for me.  I can't do that.  I mean, I would never...  If I was dating a guy, and I found out he was bisexual at all because of the whole age thing,  absolutely not.  But I do love to watch it.  Like, I will go to gay clubs.  You're out, Jim.  No, I go to gay clubs, and gay guys will come up to attractive girls, and they'll say,  you know, would you like to watch me do whatever to my boyfriend in the bathroom?  And I'm always down to watch that.  Would you like to watch me, a robot, and a young boy in a tinfoil suit? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah!  Well, it's not gay, though.  Like, say you were on a date with someone tonight who might have done that to another fella for a rock.  That would be it.  It would be over.  I like my men straight.  I like my girls straight, too.  Really?  Yeah.  You are twisted, man.  You got, like, the fantasy part of you, and then the reality is a little dick.  She's more of, like, a conservative old-world child molester.  That's not right.  Right, yeah.  I'm not a child molester.  Just in your head.  Just in my head.  Rob, what's going on? 
[02:22:00]  Hey, what's up, Bo?  Nice to meet you.  Well, this chick, I don't know.  I saw a priest.  If you guys ever come near that, just run the other way.  That movie's sick, man.  Just these saggit priests running around, man.  All right.  Great.  Thank you.  Good movie reviews we're doing now.  That's good.  That's good.  John, what's going on?  Yo, boys, what's up?  Listen, can I come in there with either a brick or a two-by-four and smack this chick in the head and kill her?  She is just too sick.  No, you can't.  Sir, my wife, please. 
[02:22:30]  Talk nicely about my wife.  Too sick.  What is getting to you, John?  Just this thing about, you know, I can't even talk.  I'm so...  You can't talk because you're too stupid to talk.  And now she's talking about...  Well, the whole Nambla thing.  Nambla?  The Nambla thing got me.  What's up with that?  That's just...  Good luck, boys.  Boys, yes.  John, Marla.  What people are misinterpreting is that there are certain fantasies you have and certain aspects of sexuality.  You know, I would never...  I would never rape a woman or force a woman, but there's a certain...  It isn't like anything in the fantasy world, anything goes, right? 
[02:23:00]  Anything in the fantasy world.  As long as you're not acting it out in real life, anything goes.  You're not breaking laws, you're not hurting anyone, you're not hurting yourself.  It's just a fantasy.  I'm not big on that.  So, to the last loser that just called, get over it.  Get a life.  Wow.  So, but you imagine these things in your head when you're getting slammed, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  If he and I were going on a date, we might do some little, like, role-playing.  Little role-playing, maybe.  You might have to discipline me.  Yes.  It's going to behave as a very dirty girl. 
[02:23:30]  Now, what is this?  Earlier, you were talking about the tinkle story.  Oh.  You get your big ass back in the kitchen and make me some pot.  Make me some pot.  Okay.  I was...  It was...  I guess it would have been my second threesome.  Yeah.  I was at a girlfriend of mine's house.  We were having dinner, and her boyfriend's very conservative, very uptight guy.  And, actually, the two of them had never had intercourse, because he had some sort of testicular cancer. 
[02:24:00]  Weird thing.  But, anyway, he went on...  This story's funny.  That's just how I feel.  But, anyway, it was a dinner for four people.  It was myself, my girlfriend, her boyfriend, and this guy.  No, no, no.  No.  The boyfriend...  Okay.  So the...  Meatballs.  No.  That would be a little insult to injury.  Anyone have a washcloth?  No, I don't eat meat from me.  Ah.  Anyway.  So the three of us were left. 
[02:24:30]  It was me, the girl, and the male stripper.  Mm-hmm.  And, somehow, we...  The boyfriend went up to bed.  We started messing around.  We went in the hot tub.  We ended up having a threesome.  And the boyfriend came down and almost caught us.  So the girl had to go upstairs to deal with her boyfriend.  So it was just me and the guy.  And the stripper guy.  Me and the stripper, and we're having sex for...  It must have been at least, like, two hours, and he wasn't climaxing.  And I'm like, dude, what can I do?  And he said, well, can you... 
[02:25:00]  Tinkle.  No, first he asked me to number, you know...  Okay, okay, all right, all right.  You can say number two.  Chuck Berry.  Chuck Berry.  Give him a Chuck Berry, a Cleveland steamer, not lunch.  Yeah.  And I said, you know, honestly, no, and I really don't have to go.  And he said, well, what about...  I don't have to go.  Wait, if you did, would you have?  No, no.  I said...  Passing gas, Opie.  Look at that.  I said, honestly, I really don't have to do that either.  You got a girl.  She's got the implants, all hot.  She's a little pervert and everything. 
[02:25:30]  Good-looking girl.  And what do you want?  That's great.  So then we get...  That's fantastic.  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Do I make you horny?  All right.  Okay.  Okay, so we settle on the tinkle thing. 
[02:26:00]  And I said, well, I really don't have to tinkle right now.  Guy runs in the kitchen, gets me a gallon of water.  He's forced feeding me water until finally I have to go.  And I...  So I stood over him.  Right, right.  Okay.  And you proceeded.  Yeah.  Yes, and he...  And he liked it?  He climaxed instantly.  Hey, how about that?  Yay!  I think we know what you're going to say.  My friend's boyfriend was so mad about the bed.  Oh, really?  Oh, bed all day.  He doesn't want to see it.  No, it was a guest bedroom. 
[02:26:30]  He was falling out in a pillow and his girlfriend's house was having a freezing.  Oh, God.  Hold on, honey.  I know you're sick.  My friend is dropping a yam-sized log on a stripper.  I think I need to go to the hospital.  Oh, there's an effing visual.  All he had to do was call Rockaway Bedding.  Don't hook him up with a new bed.  They take away the old disgusting tinkled mattress. 
[02:27:00]  That's right.  The next live read for Rockaway Bedding.  You remember this story.  All the yam-sized log on.  She should have just got the boyfriend after chemo to come in and just diuretically evacuate all over the male stripper.  Then the two girls could have talked and watched television.  Honey, I don't feel good.  All right.  Well, Dante is going to lay down.  Could you take care of him?  God, that's horrible.  That's funny.  Now I won't date male strippers anymore.  Wow, because they're weird. 
[02:27:30]  They are weird.  But also, I think they like a lot of, you know, man-on-man stuff.  A lot of them are male prostitutes.  Yeah.  And what?  You've seen this and been involved with this?  No, no, no.  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  No, I just...  I know from living in the world that male strippers tend to be male prostitutes.  Stop.  Yes.  Yeah.  And I wouldn't have anything to do sexually with a man that was involved with other men. 
[02:28:00]  But I will watch it.  Oh, but you'll watch.  Yeah.  Gets you turned on.  It gets you turned on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  How's that for a chopper?  Oh, oh, oh.  Josh Nelson-Reilly.  He was a male stripper.  That guy wanted anything from an orifice on him.  He gave her a list of options.  You had to go to the band?  Yeah.  No.  You had to fart?  No.  You had to fart?  No.  And you hear the way she said it?  We finally settled on.  Like it's a collective ball.  And I believe it's called Give and Take.  A little Give and Take?  A little Give and Take.  Push and pull, whatever.  Sure.  It helps when you're in a relationship. 
[02:28:30]  If you want 20 bucks, you ask for 50.  And you're like, oh, you find yourself.  Right.  You're bogging it down.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Norton, Aaron?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Norton, if you go after this chick, this is the best thing you'll ever have.  Oh, you really?  And what are you basing that on?  Because I dated a chick just like her.  It was the best thing you'll ever have.  Maybe you've dated me.  Who are you?  Are you wild?  Are you considered like a wild girl?  Oh, I love wild chicks.  Maybe in the...  Not you, jack-off.  Jesus Christ.  I don't care if you're a wild little girl.  Are you a wild girl? 
[02:29:00]  Well, let me tell you, I'm pretty good.  Shut up, ass F.  Rob has a problem.  Rob, what's up?  Call on radio.  Hey, Rob.  Rob.  Rob, Bob, Slob, whatever your name is, you're on the air.  Speak.  The guy who wants to talk about Nambla.  Oh, breathing heavy.  Telephone in the taco.  All right.  So that's a cute little story you got there.  My God.  Now, are you? 
[02:29:30]  You consider yourself a wild?  Like you'd give Norton quite the ride?  I mean, if you're going to...  If I'm having sex with you, yeah, you're going to enjoy it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Hey, are you attracted to Norton?  We just got to get around that three meal thing?  What?  Yeah, I'm not going to sleep with him tonight, but I mean, I like...  What about a, you know, like a little...  I wouldn't sleep with him.  What about a handy?  Not the first night.  What?  Not the first night?  No, I actually don't.  I never have sex at first night.  You didn't really?  No, I don't know anybody at all.  It's too weird.  I'd let him take me on a date.  That's weird. 
[02:30:00]  The second night you're usually incarcerated.  I would love to.  I would love to hear what your date is about with this guy.  I'm good on a date.  I just eat.  I'm mellow.  Norton, do you want to go on a date?  I suppose.  Of course.  I suppose.  I'm kidding.  Oh, kid, sarcastic.  Oh, did you scare me then?  Is he blowing me off?  I know.  That's why I thought he was kidding.  She's great.  She's a little wacky, but she's pretty hot.  She's bright, though, and she's...  Norton, your roommate's checking in.  Jim Florentine.  Jim, let me say for the record, I'm not sure if we said it.  You killed at the WWF restaurant.  Yeah.  And we thank you.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:30:30]  Thanks, man.  It was cool.  So what's going on today?  The final C-blocker coming in right now, right now?  No, not at all.  Jim Florentine's a pro.  Never.  Yeah.  Look at him.  He's a pro.  I made the Pro Bowl last year for not C-blocking.  No, never block.  Okay.  I just want to let Aaron...  If you bring Aaron back to our apartment, I'm putting the tarp down right now.  No, you have like a grounds crew come out when I bring a Tinkle Girl home.  Yeah, just in case it's a little rain, you know, we're putting the tarp down.  I don't think you're laying down the plastic in case you guys decide to kill me.  No, no, no.  No, that's it.  I'm a weapon, too.  And, Aaron, you're into like a little boy kind of thing, because I've seen Jim naked. 
[02:31:00]  He looks like a little boy.  I always chase him around the house trying to put a diaper on him last night.  So, how big is his junk?  It's pretty big.  Hey, how about that?  Yeah, I've seen it.  I've seen it.  He's well hung?  Yeah, he's well hung.  Dorn, he's good.  And he's a trooper, too.  Really?  Yeah, you know, those little guys got to go the extra mile.  You're right, man.  And, Jim, you did see that movie, Priest.  I mean, you didn't talk about it.  I don't know if I saw it, man. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I read it to you.  I don't remember if I watched it.  I was telling you, it was like a homo movie.  Ten minutes later, asked me to borrow the hand cream.  I really don't remember if I saw it, man.  If I did, I'm sure I'd remember that.  You've got to see the sigpick that somebody put up with me and Aaron talking.  That is hilarious.  Hey, you're into rape?  I'm into rape.  I think I love you.  It's a picture.  Look at it.  It's me talking to her with a microphone.  It's hilarious.  Whoever invented that, you have to send that to my email.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Hey, we have audio of your date, Norton. 
[02:32:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin and does this whenever it's told.  He's a very decent man.  All right, Jim.  Well, thanks, Aaron.  He's a good guy.  I think you should go out with him.  Okay, when we're doing it.  I work every night.  We'll work something out.  We'll figure it out.  We'll spend time together.  We'll have a good time.  We actually have audio of the date before it even happens.  Thank you, Jim.  Sounds like you're having fun. 
[02:32:30]  Ricky, what's going on?  Hey, O'Neal.  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah, I just wanted to tell him, and if he is going to bang her, then better watch out  for his butterscotch pudding there.  Oh, don't ruin it.  No, stop.  It's too hot, man.  It's too hot.  What is butterscotch pudding?  This caller one time called in, and he had gotten a hooker, and he was rubbing her.  Oh, I know the call you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Disgusting caller.  Yeah, it was good.  I have a story about that.  All right.  All right.  Should we take a break and get into the next story, or what?  All right.  We'll take a quick break and get into a story that she has that may be similar to the butterscotch 
[02:33:00]  bookstore story.  Oh, no.  That's the cheese.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What the hell is turning off the radio?  More audio from Norton's date.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Booze.  The world's universal language.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Rick's taking lots of pictures for the website.  Oh, yeah.  Of Aaron. 
[02:33:30]  He's doing all the poses.  Very photogenic girl.  Any pictures with her clothes off?  Jim Norton in studio.  There's a guy that wants to give out some info here.  Brett, what's up?  They actually have a chat line in New York where you can meet women like this all the time.  Well, there's chat lines for everything.  No, no, no.  But I'm telling you, I've met ten women in the past six months from this line.  I had a woman on a bed sticking ice cube. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  All right.  What do you think, Norton?  What do you think, Norton?  They need the big perverts.  It's great if you're making an ice latte, but I'm not kidding.  No, let me tell you another thing.  I once got one of those camping purifiers that you kind of like pump from the riverbed.  You put one end in the sink filled with water and the other end in her A, and you just pump away, baby.  That's good if you're a basement. 
[02:34:30]  I don't understand what you're talking about.  That's awesome.  Derek in the Texas oil fields, baby.  Later, faggot.  All right, bro.  Someone wants to book you for a gig.  Let's see how real this is.  All right.  Mark, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  I didn't want to actually, I don't want to be on air, though.  Oh, you know what I'm talking about.  All right, Bob.  Yeah, you know it.  See you later, then. 
[02:35:00]  I have a question, too.  I got to throw something out there.  Go.  Anyone out there know how to make a website, man?  I want to get a website made, too.  Oh.  I'm going to give out an email address.  This is not my only one, but this is one of four that I use, and this I will check.  That's me.  T-I-N-K-L-E.  Shockingly, it wasn't taken.  Tinkle Drinker.  Tinkle Drinker at AOL.com.  I'm surprised AOL let you have that.  Well, I mean, there's nothing wrong with drinking a little tinkle.  I'm surprised he felt the need to spell out drinker. 
[02:35:30]  Well, no, because Mark, you know, they would spell T-I-N-K-E-L, but it's K-L-E, I believe,  if you're going to spell tinkle properly.  And I will answer all that I can.  If anybody knows how to build a website.  Oh, yeah.  There's plenty of people, I'm sure.  No, I know.  You're going to get a lot of computer geniuses.  If you ever did that sig pic of me, please send it to me.  That is hilarious.  That's a good one.  All right.  Joey.  Joey.  Joey.  Speak.  Hello.  I hear your car in the background. 
[02:36:00]  Talk to guys before they go to jail.  That guy.  What's up?  I hear you're on the phone.  Hello?  Oh.  You hear me, boys?  Yes.  What's the radio station?  What's your name?  Hey, Johnny, not Joey.  Johnny.  All right.  Johnny Rainey.  Yes, Johnny.  Now, listen.  You guys are really getting, you know, getting out of control here.  You know, what is it?  Around the Park with Aaron.  Well, Aaron's a little out there. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, but you guys aren't getting a little out.  You're getting out of your mind, man.  This is, we're entering the mind of this girl, and she's got these fantasies.  Yeah, I know.  She might have the panties on the outside of her pants.  No, it's just, you guys are just good.  You're like a cold radio show.  All right.  Well, thank you.  People like this exist, and what, we should just ignore them?  Yeah, because if you don't bring it up and they don't talk, maybe they don't really,  they're not really out there.  This girl's got some things going on in that head. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Very good girl.  You like that.  Oh, yeah.  To think we want to play that game with her, too.  Yeah.  You know what game.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Is she coming back in for the grand finale?  Let's hope.  Rodney, what's up?  Yeah, I'm the one responsible for those pictures.  Norton knows me.  Oh, hey, what's up, man?  What's going on, buddy?  Yes, I know you very well.  They're already in the mail, buddy.  I'm sending them to you.  Thanks a lot, buddy.  No problem, man.  All right.  He's a psycho, too. 
[02:37:30]  He looks like John Holmes, this guy.  Real weird-looking character.  Johnny the Wandhole?  Yeah.  What would that be?  I don't know what his meal looks like.  Let's get Aaron back in here.  A lot of guys will do websites for you.  We'll get that info, all right?  Okay, yeah.  I'll let you email me.  Just stay on hold, and we'll get info.  Yeah, if you guys got it, just email us.  It's cool.  Know that, Opie?  At AOL.com.  So everyone that wants to give Jim a free website, please just email me. 
[02:38:00]  It doesn't have to be free.  I mean, this looks good, though.  Yeah.  That wants to help you out.  Hi.  I'm trying to get a part of this story.  Are you naked?  No.  Can we see you again?  What?  Why are you covering up?  Why are you hiding in the good of them?  Because I don't want to sit here naked.  Why?  After everything she said.  Oops, they're falling out.  Oops.  Whoa.  Hey, look at that. 
[02:38:30]  She can actually reach them with the other parts of her body.  Yeah.  You're a naughty girl.  So, Erin, anything else?  Because we've got to get out of here.  Oh, you wanted the one story about the...  Oh, yeah.  We had another tease, didn't we?  It was like a butterscotch pudding.  It wasn't my butterscotch pudding.  Hey, um, when I was in college, I was a freshman in the dorms, and one of my best...  That's hot right there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can make a lot of money in those dorms.  Those kids love to, you know...  Love to what?  Smoke the wacky tobacco.  Oh, so you sold some weed. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, I sold some weed.  I sold some everything.  Really?  Everything?  A little blow?  You know, call me crazy, but I didn't have you pegged for a druggie.  No.  I'm not a druggie.  I was just an entrepreneur.  Oh, very good entrepreneur.  Entrepreneur.  Business classes.  Yeah.  So what happened with the pudding?  Yeah, what is this?  Um, one of my best guy friends had this, like, you know, you could say skank, right?  Sure.  This girl, you know, he just wanted to, like, get his rocks off, so he was with one of  the ultimate skank, and after they were done, I guess they did it in the dark, she obtained 
[02:39:30]  the nickname Spam Chunks, because there were...  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Spam Chunks?  Yes.  Why?  Because of the remnants that were on the bed looked like...  Have you ever seen Spam?  Yes.  When you open it?  Oh.  Looked like...  Wow.  Spam Chunks.  So...  That is great.  What a great, disgusting story.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Gross out for the end of the day.  And look at that. 
[02:40:00]  Another screen name up for grabs.  Spam Chunks.  Spam Chunks.  Oh, who's not jumping on the name Spam Chunks right now?  Now, Spam Chunks.  Spam Chunks.  Any more descriptive?  Did they say what it was, or what they thought it was?  Oh, we could...  I mean, it could have been from maybe menstrual cycle.  Right, right.  Sure.  Unicycle, menstrual cycle, whatever.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Something like that.  Wow.  Hey, do you guys know if Jimmy Fallon ever listens to this radio station?  Jimmy Fallon, very big fan of this show. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yes.  I went to high school with him.  You did?  Aaron is not my real name, but I went to high school with him.  Are you blowing off Norton for Jimmy Fallon?  No, no, no.  We were just friends in high school.  You were a good friend.  Did you ever have sex with Jimmy Fallon?  No, not at all, but we used to hang out.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Anything maybe that wasn't sex?  The president's version of not sex?  No, no, no.  We were totally just...  Actually, he was...  I love guys that make me laugh.  That was like, that's all I'm looking for in a guy.  And he was the funniest person.  Wait until Norton pulls those pants down. 
[02:41:00]  Really enjoy him.  It's a scream.  He was the funniest person I had ever met in high school.  And all he used to talk about was getting on Saturday Night Live.  We all knew he was going to be on.  Really?  That's all he was talking about.  Premonition.  Yeah.  I hear he's good, too.  I haven't seen it as the news anchor, but I heard he was good.  He's really funny on that show.  He's very good, man.  Very funny.  He's a nice guy.  Jimmy's a nice guy.  And he was a very nice guy.  Yeah, really nice guy.  Opie, I can't get this story off a drudge, but the link is it shows Anna Nicole Smith  and says, jury, not a penny.  So I believe the jury made a decision on whether she gets that old codger's money. 
[02:41:30]  Remember that guy she was married to, the ancient guy, 90 years old?  He dropped dead, and she's been trying to get his money?  I can assume she's not getting a penny of the money, which just makes it hysterical  that she was boning this goddamn Mr. Burns.  Anna, please come here.  I need a BJ.  And gets nothing.  Nothing in return.  There you go.  Oh, the poor whore.  That is so funny. 
[02:42:00]  Isn't that funny?  Like, she obviously should get it, because she put in the effort, but I just love the  idea that she gets nothing for having to suck on that.  Yes, keep going.  I'll just stand here and poke you with a stick.  See, I like the old...  I love that one.  See when Homer's effing off, and he comes into his room, and he goes, I just stand here  and poke you with a stick for an hour.  Ouch.  He just keeps poking.  I love that show.  All right.  I love the old guy, young girl thing, but he's too old. 
[02:42:30]  That's old too old for you, are you?  Old.  You're like, what's the perfect age for this weird fantasy, young girl, older guy fantasy?  The guy's like 55.  The girl's about 12.  Okay, terrific.  But she's blossoming.  I'm sorry we hit that burst of turbulence without me informing you to tighten that seat belt.  As you see, some people got thrown about the cabin, so this doesn't happen again.  Please.  Oh, my God, we're... 
[02:43:00]  There goes a week.  I really apologize for this.  There's no way we're plummeting into the ocean.  I didn't really see that one coming.  Thank you for flying, United.  Oh, my God, what is that from?  Is that...  That's Castaway.  That is direct Castaway, audience.  Yeah.  55 and 12.  55 and 12. 
[02:43:30]  We have a woman in here in aisle three doing squat thrust reading the JonBenet Ramsey transcripts.  You know what was a great airplane or jet plane sound effect for a movie?  On the Twilight Zone movie with this man on the wing.  You know that one?  Every time the lightning and thunder hit, for some reason the engines went...  I mean, why would they do that during a storm like that?  But it was great. 
[02:44:00]  Great plane sound effect.  It had to be the best plane sound effect in a movie if there was an award for that.  Why are we talking like this?  When there's a great TF girl just sitting there.  Well, could you leave us with a hot, hot story?  A hot, hot story.  Hot, hot story.  Some of the hottest, steamiest encounters.  Maybe something that...  You guys got it.  I have so many hot stories.  I mean, do you want along the lines of lesbians?  Do you want along the lines of threesomes?  Do you want along the lines of stories from when I was really little?  Tell me what you want. 
[02:44:30]  I should get them categorized.  Yeah, they're all...  I mean, like, what do you want?  Wow.  I guess we'd have to go lesbian.  Lesbian.  Okay, my last lesbian encounter, I went to Scores, actually, because I live right by Scores.  Can you do this one, Topless?  I think it'll just help the story.  No, because I'm on the camera, right?  Hey, screw the listeners.  Let's just turn that thing around.  You can watch the reaction.  Hide the pizza box.  Yeah, there you go.  You can watch Norton's reaction.  Oh, I can't do this, Topless. 
[02:45:00]  I can't talk, Topless.  Yeah, you can.  I got to talk.  Oh, look at Norton.  She's a shy, shy little girl, Norton.  Look at that.  I like that.  Wait, what was the story again?  Okay, I'm at Scores.  And anyway, I met this girl.  She wasn't a dancer there.  She was a dancer from San Diego.  She was there with her boyfriend.  And this girl, she was unbelievably hot.  And we just, like, connected.  Look, Rick's racing her.  Well, she likes the fantasy.  Rick's, like, tugging at her.  Jesus Christ, can you tell his wife's out of town? 
[02:45:30]  He's tugging at the goddamn clothes.  He was trying to pull the scarf off.  Give me the scarf.  Dental work is expensive.  Don't make me punch you, bitch.  Oh, I like that.  I like to be hit.  You like to be hit?  Smack.  Smack?  Oh, my God.  Yes.  I'm going to go out on a limb, but I don't think there's anything you don't like.  No, there is stuff I don't like.  Sure.  Guys, can I please come in? 
[02:46:00]  Because I believe this girl is right up my alley.  I would allegedly punch her and rape her.  And I believe she would allegedly like it.  My ex-boyfriend and I used to fight.  And he would smack me.  I'd pretend to get all mad.  But it turned me on so.  So much.  Oh, my God.  Like.  Smacking.  Come on.  Smack me, baby.  Wow.  Come on.  For the listeners.  You want to give a little smack?  No, I certainly will. 
[02:46:30]  Do you want it on the face or the ass?  Oh, face.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, it's cool.  It's cool.  Look at the door.  Is that too weird?  Smack her in the face.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're going to get off on this?  I like it.  You like it.  You better make a sound, baby.  All right.  Hold on.  Get the mic close.  Put the mic close.  Turn her head.  That's a beautiful face, though.  Yeah.  That was nice.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You smacked me.  That's a winner.  That's a winner. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  You like that?  I love that.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  I cannot believe what I just saw.  I try not to encourage it in relationships, but I...  No, I just walked up and smashed her in the face.  You don't even know her.  She won't sleep with you on the first date, but she'll allow that.  I don't have sex in the face today.  Oh, God.  Is that great?  Because there's two pops in the face.  Did he do that right?  He was holding her, dude.  He's holding her chin, and he turns her head the right way, and then she just clots her 
[02:47:30]  in the side of the face.  Yeah, but you don't do it again.  You build up to how hard somebody wants it.  You never want to go too hard.  Right, you've got to keep doing it, and then it gets louder and louder and louder and louder.  You don't want to hurt somebody.  I like it.  You are a sick F, and you're scaring me.  I wouldn't even have done that.  I'm going to bite the ear off.  One more time.  Oh, here we go.  Wait, he's going to smack her ass?  One more time.  One more time.  Let him rip those down. 
[02:48:00]  Wait, you like it hard there, too?  Very.  Very hard, Norton.  You heard it, right?  Oh, you like smack on the ass.  Oh, look at that boot.  Right-handed, baby.  You're on this way.  You better leave a mark.  Get a good...  You're hitting her hip.  Trust me.  Pull that down.  There you go.  This is legal, isn't it?  It's right here.  It's just...  What?  No, this is...  No cameras.  All right, no cameras.  Steve, you're going to ruin it.  No cameras.  I won't leave a mark.  All right, the camera's done.  Okay.  All right, the camera's done.  Let her hold the camera so she feels... 
[02:48:30]  There we go.  Get rid of that camera.  Harder.  Harder.  Harder.  Woo!  Oh, wow.  That was hard enough.  Hold.  Let's see the handprint.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Can we stab you?  No, that I don't like.  No?  No, you see, you build up to her.  She says harder.  Like, you don't start too hard.  Right, don't start hard.  You work your way into it. 
[02:49:00]  Let somebody tell you what they want.  Yes, that's what I see.  Can we throw you in a dumpster?  Imagine that.  Just walk up and heave her in a dumpster.  But that's fun.  Craig, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Today, I learned that spam chunks are off the hook, yo.  Vindication when Aaron watches Norton and Marco go at it.  All right.  Ooh.  I'd love to see that.  Oh, God.  How do I get pegged as gay?  I'm smacking a beautiful girl.  How do I get pegged as gay?  You smacked her in the face.  One time, it was an accident.  I'm not gay. 
[02:49:30]  Ha ha!  Bitch.  Yeah.  Uh, Sean has something.  Sean, what's up?  Uh, yeah, I think in the spirit of the old, uh, perverse sound clips, you guys should,  uh, replay some tape afterwards and, uh, and, and get some, uh, sound clips from this  chick.  She's giving us gold here.  Oh, absolutely.  What do you want?  She's telling us faith.  She's telling us she likes to be smacked.  All this stuff is gold.  Smacked in the face.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, my lesbian scores story.  We skipped right over it.  We got some good smacks in there.  That was, you know, we really replaced it with, you know, a Sesame Street impression. 
[02:50:00]  We smacked in the face and ass, my God.  I'm thinking one more, one more slap.  Well, depending on how she feels, again, it's all.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, sure.  Where?  I mean, the other side's jealous.  You only smack one side of my head.  One side, yeah.  I was thinking the, the face.  Oh, my God, Opie.  I'll do whatever she wants.  I like the face better.  Do you?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, which cheek did he smack?  This one.  He smacked the, uh, that cheek.  Now, the other one.  Just so she can leave here with rosy cheeks.  Instead of rosy. 
[02:50:30]  Norton, make a full fist.  Wind up and punch her teeth out.  I'll leave him here with rosy cheeks and with Norton.  All right.  Jim, come on.  Norton, kick her in the face.  Look at the look Jim gives.  This is so wrong.  Jim, this is so effing wrong.  Jim, wait, wait, wait.  Calm down.  Rick, look out.  I got to see this.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Harder, harder.  Back it up a little bit.  I want to do a short.  Oh, God. 
[02:51:00]  One more.  One more.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Woo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I like that.  He, like, he, like, rubs her cheek a little first and then just goes, whacks.  That's the way you got to do it.  Norton, you kind of know what you're doing there when you're smacking girls around.  Jim, you owe us.  But it's all respect for the limits.  It's all, see?  It's all respect for the limits.  See, that's what she wants.  Absolutely.  And I like someone who respects my limits.  Absolutely.  Me and Norton could have some fun. 
[02:51:30]  I think it's, uh, you guys are on the road to, uh, some heavy petting, at least.  But she knows also, I mean, look, that I wouldn't do anything she didn't want me to do.  She said, don't smack me no more.  I wouldn't go in.  I wouldn't like it.  I like doing it.  You know, I would just go, all right, cool.  I wouldn't do it.  Yeah, you don't have to sell that beer.  I'd like to sneak one more in.  Win.  You know, don't forget, I got shot down in high school a lot.  Somebody has to pay.  I'm amazed.  Yeah, that's great.  Wow, man, this is so wrong.  This has been so wrong. 
[02:52:00]  We just got to get out of here.  I love it.  I love O.P. and Anthony.  I love us, too.  Where else am I going to see this?  I love O.P. and Anthony, too.  I love O.P. and Anthony.  Absolutely fabulous.  Fabulous, if I may use the gay word.  Fabulous.  It was good, right?  It was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you two got a little future together.  Yes, I think we'll get along with it.  I see.  I just see you two going out and having a good time.  Yeah, maybe we'll have some kids so we can have some fun with them. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, if it hadn't been sick enough, people.  Can I please applaud her?  Let's grow them at home idea.  That's sick.  We'll breed our own snuff film.  And if one is ugly, we throw it to the dogs.  Okay, Erin, thanks for everything.  This has been wonderful.  Oh, thank you, guys.  It's been a pure pleasure.  She's mellow.  I like her.  She's mellow.  She's not over the top and still, but you're great. 
[02:53:00]  You're great.  No, she's not over the top at all.  No, no, but you know what I mean, loud.  She's not loud.  She seems like, you know what she seems like?  Yeah, because she's quiet.  Like, you would go there, she'd tell you, you know, pull up to a 7-Eleven, I've got to get something.  She'd go out, walk out, and you'd realize she just killed everyone in there and robbed the place and had sex in there.  But just, hi, how you doing?  I love you, Mickey.  She's a loose cannon.  How's her face?  She's beautiful.  A little red, let me see.  A little red.  She's got the rosy cheeks now. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, it's warm.  A little warm.  Mm-hmm.  Norton's spinning back fist.  Spinning back fist.  My face feels ripe for another smack.  I'll give you one.  Okay.  I'll give you one.  Depends on how her behavior is later.  Norton, what do you need to plug today?  You killed.  Nothing.  Nothing?  Nothing.  You need a website.  And, you know, my mother and father are listening.  Mom, these are all jokes.  I had to face that when I get home.  My sweet mother, you don't do those things, do you?  No.  Not at all.  Look her in the eyes. 
[02:54:00]  And then you smack her in the face.  Come on, Mommy smacks you.  Remember Michael with the cake?  No.  Yeah.  Godfather, that's what it's like.  All right.  No, just the ultimate lie right to the face.  No.  Doesn't Norton want to plug me, though?  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Look at that.  Wow.  This is us.  Wow.  Look at that.  Any woman that enjoys incest and puns.  I want to know.  Right.  All right.  Aaron, thanks, I think.  Okay.  Yeah, because that was unbelievable. 
[02:54:30]  You're a girl.  That's right, Homer.  Let's get the F out of here.  Great.  Whip them out Wednesday.  What is that?  Like some kind of guy name?  Like some kind of sexist guy name?  Yeah!  You will not get away with it!  I wish you could just shut your bitch up.  It's Whip them out Wednesday!  Who's that?  Obi and Anthony.  N.E.W. </pre>
