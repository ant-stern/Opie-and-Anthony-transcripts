FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's an intro.  You know what?  If I go see a doctor or any of that stuff, I want to see an Indian.  Indian guys are good doctors.  Number one, matter of fact.  Indian female.  Because then they're going to get back to you.  Then they can touch your wee-wee without you feeling funny.  No matter what.  I got the sniffles.  Touch my wee-wee.  I think I got the swine flu.  I kind of love when female doctors touch my wee-wee.  It's kind of fun.  It's nerve-wracking, though.  Because you don't want to come off too small.  But you're nervous because you're at the doctor. 
[00:00:30]  You know what?  And it's hard to fluff.  What's wrong with you?  What?  You're in the waiting room or the examining room long enough without a doctor.  You really are.  You plump it up a little bit.  You squeeze it.  Very hard to plump up in that examining room.  No, you just squeeze through your jeans a few times.  That's all it takes.  I need a little more warmth.  I get a little shaky at the doctor.  I don't like going to doctors.  It's not like a phobia thing where I won't go.  But I don't like being in that office. </pre>
