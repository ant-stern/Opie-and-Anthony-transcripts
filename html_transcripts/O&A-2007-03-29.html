<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a focus on "Stepfather Day," prompting numerous caller anecdotes about awkward and often humorous interactions with attractive stepdaughters.  Callers described scenarios involving minimal clothing, nude pool parties, and unintentional flirtation, leading to discussions about the blurry lines between attraction and appropriate behavior.  One caller recounted being aroused while his stepdaughter slept, another described stumbling upon a nude pool party.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton (with Jim Norton’s sister present in the studio),  commented on these stories,  expressing both amusement and the internal conflicts these situations presented to stepfathers.  Frustration with perceived censorship from program director John Minnelli, who was described as evasively moving around the studio, and a discussion about an online FCC test and the legal aspects of relationships involving minors were also included.  The segment concluded with commentary on a video of President Bush at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Dinner, criticized by the hosts as inappropriate given the ongoing war.

The show then transitioned to a segment heavily featuring a video clip of George W. Bush and Karl Rove dancing and rapping at an event.  The hosts and callers reacted with a mix of amusement and criticism, frequently using racially charged and offensive language to describe the scene and the participants.  The authenticity of Bush's humor and the dancing abilities of those involved, particularly a Black man, were questioned. This transitioned back to the "Stepfather's Day" theme with more sexually suggestive and inappropriate caller anecdotes.  The discussion included speculation on an apparently intoxicated Chuck Liddell's appearance on a morning show.  Further listener opinions on President Bush's actions, ranging from amusement to outrage, were presented. The hosts frequently interjected with jokes, tangents, and references to Jennifer Lopez and other media personalities.

A subsequent segment featured calls about unconventional relationships and inappropriate thoughts. Kevin described his marriage to a much older woman and his discomfort with her older daughter, leading to sexually explicit jokes from the hosts and callers.  The conversation shifted to the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus Comedy Tour, with announcements about upcoming dates and potential collaboration with WWE.  Further calls included a grandfather's inappropriate behavior with his granddaughter and a stepfather's advances toward a teenage caller, Mackenzie, prompting a discussion about the difference between having inappropriate thoughts and acting on them.  A news story about a man fighting alimony payments to his ex-wife who underwent a sex change was also discussed with crude humor and sexually explicit language.  A call from Diana, shaving in her bathtub, featured a lengthy conversation about her body, sex life, views on American Idol, and Andrew Dice Clay.  The segment concluded with a reading of an Andrew Dice Clay interview excerpt from *Stepping Out* magazine about his feud with Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony’s supposed role in saving his career.

A significant portion of the show focused on Mancow Muller, a rival shock jock.  Audio clips of Mancow criticizing Opie and Anthony's success were played, followed by a vehement rebuttal from the hosts, highlighting Mancow's perceived diminished career and smaller market reach.  Jim Norton shared a story about Mancow asking him to play a rapist on his show.  The hosts discussed Mancow's perceived shift toward a more morally upright on-air persona and various listener opinions on the conflict. An unsuccessful attempt to reach Mancow via phone call was made.  Dice's past relationship with Mancow and his current quieter demeanor were discussed.  Other topics included a listener's belief that Britain was keeping the US uninvolved in a hostage situation, and an impersonation of Jackie Mason.  Upcoming guests Kurt Russell, Black Sabbath, and Quentin Tarantino were mentioned.

The final segment centered on repeated attempts to get Mancow Muller on the air. After a tip-off from a listener later revealed to be Ron Bennington, Mancow refused. The hosts, using extensive profanity, called Mancow a "pussy" and repeatedly attempted to contact him, along with various callers.  The phrase "Love you, love your show" was used satirically by callers.  A host struggled with the phone system, adding to the comedic chaos.  The conversation included references to Howard Stern, Andrew Dice Clay, Ron and Fez, and various pop culture figures.  A listener shared a sexually explicit story about a "homework assignment" given by the hosts regarding improving their sex life.  The segment ended with discussion of Mancow's refusal, showcasing listener calls ranging from supportive to hostile, and the revelation of a potentially prank website about Mancow containing explicit content, to which the hosts reacted with shock and amusement.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  And the light breaks, creeping through the shadow, an unstoppable force, lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my God!  Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I can see you.  I think I'm scared.  Oh, God!  Holy mother of God! 
[00:00:30]  Oh boy, please don't.  God damn it.  What?  What?  Oh, it stinks so bad.  Oh my God.  This is killing me.  You're killing me.  Just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my God!  I got to tell you, Jackson!  You just got to stand here.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  Oh!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Oh God! 
[00:01:00]  Oh God!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Oh God!  Oh God!  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at this face.  How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  Oh!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  All right.  Let's get the show on the road.  Look at all those phones are ringing.  Ring.  Ring.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  I hope it's not just people reminding us.  Ring-a-ding-ding.  Oh yeah, it is.  The phones have exploded.  It can only mean one thing.  Yeah.  Good morning and welcome to Stepfather Day on the Opie and Anthony show.  Stepfather Day.  Stepfather Day, you rock. 
[00:02:00]  Waking up all the stepdads this morning.  Hi, stepdad.  Good morning, all you stepfathers out there.  Good morning to you.  And, in particular, the stepfathers with hot stepdaughters.  That's right.  That's right.  You just heard that.  Yeah.  Or stepdaughters that have hot friends. 
[00:02:30]  That's what we're gunning for today.  We're waking up all the stepfathers with very hot stepdaughters.  Yeah.  You know how it is.  Well, you know, maybe you've been married for many years to the woman.  Maybe your stepdaughter was an infant or a toddler when you first came into the family.  And you feel about her the same way you do if it was your own daughter. 
[00:03:00]  That's, you know.  But, in the darkness of night, something happens, doesn't it?  You kind of know it's not really flesh and blood.  You know there's no real blood thing going on.  But, in that circumstance, it would be a little odd.  We're kind of looking for the stepdad that just came into the family, started dating the mom, and then they hit it off really well. 
[00:03:30]  They get married.  Well, no, the mom goes, ah, one other thing.  I need you to meet my daughter.  Meet my daughter.  Okay.  And you went over to the house for a dinner.  And, wow.  Thank Poison Ivy.  Right.  Thank, ah.  Oh, Poison Ivy on the piano bench.  Now, a lot of you are out there going, you sick Fs, Opie and Anthony and Jimmy Norton.  You guys are sick Fs.  We're not looking for the stories of actually doing something about it. 
[00:04:00]  No, no, no.  We're just looking for the stepfathers out there that will admit today that, oh, my God, the woman's daughter is beyond hot.  Is beyond hot.  I will never touch her or anything, but, oh, my God, you came over the house, and when you were introduced, honestly, you had to cover up, like, what you were thinking.  You had to just say, hi, how are you?  But what were you thinking in your head when you first laid eyes on that daughter? 
[00:04:30]  As the stepdad, when she got a little more comfortable and maybe is walking around the house with the little panties on or a little nighty or something like that, what's going through your head?  You know you got to keep it cool.  You got to keep it on the DL, but you're looking, you're sneaking a glance, and then you got to look at mom over there and kind of feel all guilty.  What's going through your head if you're a stepdad and your stepdaughter is just a babe? 
[00:05:00]  That's got to be a little frustrating, a little weird.  A little confusion in that old noggin of yours.  Guilt, maybe.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So it would be very difficult to not say something.  Well, our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, how are you, man?  I got to say, I usually don't turn the radio on until 6.05 just to avoid John and Jeff.  But this morning, I was up early. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, they suck, man.  I got to tell you, I make fun of them every morning because I have to go do my business in that bathroom, and they got John and Jeff blasting.  It makes me stay in the bathroom for a total of 30 seconds.  E-Rock, how long am I in there every morning?  And trust me, I'm getting a lot done.  I think I'd soil myself before listening to them next.  They are god-awful.  His delivery on the radio is annoying.  You just want to, like, bop him on the nose or something. 
[00:06:00]  They take tough stanza.  That's the problem.  They're too controversial.  Oh, the subject matter they handle.  He's going to Thailand to live with that little boy he's going to see all the time or something.  I got to tell you, I feel for John Minnelli.  He's the program director here at Free FM in New York City.  He's lurking in one of these shadows.  We have a huge studio.  Is it that shadow today?  I don't know.  Where is he?  We don't really see this guy.  We get emails from him.  And every once in a while, we'll see, like, Scooby-Doo eyes in the dunking booth.  He's just peering in here and taking a look at things. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, we never quite know where he is.  But, you know, we beat him up on a regular basis, John Minnelli.  But the reality is I do respect the guy.  I really do.  And I know for a fact that John Minnelli's hands are tied.  Oh, whoa, whoa, John!  See, you mentioned him, and he thought you saw him, and he moved.  He moves around the room like a cockroach.  Oh, hey!  Goes again.  John?  John?  John!  Where did you go?  Oh, whoa! 
[00:07:00]  I could have sworn I saw a shadow.  Yeah, he gets all his dirty work done when it's still dark outside.  See, as soon as the sun comes, you know, through this huge window we got?  Yeah, he's gone.  Then he's gone.  You know, he knows then that we're going to be able to see him.  But now he's jotting down things on a little pad.  I know for a fact that poor John Minnelli's hands are tied here at Free FM in New York City.  He has the ideal lineup for this radio station.  The ideal lineup. 
[00:07:30]  And guess what?  Can that.  Can't do it.  Can that.  Can't do it.  Can that.  Can't do it.  He wants to make some adjustments, some changes, maybe move this show to this time, and then this show to this time, maybe get rid of a show.  He's got a whole master plan.  Speculation.  He's got a master plan, and corporate will not allow him at this time to make these changes. 
[00:08:00]  And he's very, very frustrated.  Yes.  What happened?  I'm just looking at the press conference there between Vince McMahon and Donald Trump with Stone Cold Steve Austin in the shot.  And isn't that the one that our own Sam went to?  Yeah.  Well, we'll have to talk about that a little later.  A little later.  So.  Yeah.  Anyway, yeah, John and Jeff.  Yuck.  Asking all the tough questions.  John and Jeff, yuck.  Stepfathers, good morning.  Good morning.  The ones with the hot stepdaughters. 
[00:08:30]  Those are the ones we want to talk to.  And why don't we say hi to Daniel in Iowa.  Daniel, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I love the show.  Cool.  Thank you, sir.  I was with a lady at the time who's now my ex.  And we were in bed one night and we were making love and spooning with her in front of me.  And her daughter, 15 years old, just dropped dead model material.  Gorgeous.  Came in and laid down in front of her mother and excited me so much that I finished right there. 
[00:09:00]  See, I know America doesn't want to hear this, but I'm telling you, this is going on, unfortunately.  She must have gotten scared.  She had a little nightmare.  Huh?  I never moved when she laid down and finished.  There you go.  I hope Al didn't dump that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, that's what's going on in America.  Here's the other thing with the stepdaughter thing. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And I'm talking to the stepfather.  So you got a new woman.  She's got the young daughter.  The young daughter now thinks that you're a daddy.  Yeah, a little daddy figure.  So now she's just walking around the house in almost nothing at times.  Yeah, like she would normally, you know, just walking around, panties, or maybe a little towel.  Oh, I just got out of the shower.  Oh, I hope my towel doesn't slip.  Oh, this towel.  Mom, why didn't you wash my longer towel? 
[00:10:00]  I have to put the shorter one on around me, and my butt hangs out.  They're dressing like Britney Spears.  You're trying to watch the big game, and you're on the couch gulping as she walks through the living room.  Yeah.  She's got little panties on and an oversized t-shirt.  But in her world, it's like, it's okay, because you're the new daddy.  There's nothing crazy going on in your head. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, hi.  Hi, stepdaddy.  I was just showing mommy my new bra and panty sets I got from Vicky's.  Look, they match.  I had nothing.  And we're not talking, like Anthony said, about the ones that you kind of brought up from like an infant or two.  Yeah, because then you look at them like you're a real kid.  We're talking about instant teenager.  All of a sudden, you're going through your life. 
[00:11:00]  You decide to date this woman.  And all of a sudden, what?  She has a teenage daughter?  Now, this high school pool party is going on in your backyard.  Yeah, you were living in your basement with your parents.  Next thing you know, you're married in this high school freaking swim party is going on in your yard.  Swim parties in your yard.  And they all have to run around the house naked to get a little crazy.  And you're sitting, peering through the window at all this.  Let's go to Mongo, the trucker.  Mongo.  Morning, boys.  Good morning, Mongo. 
[00:11:30]  How are you?  I'm just waking up.  I had this girl I was dating married into a family with a 15-year-old daughter.  About 5'7", 100 pounds, soaking wet, B-cups, gorgeous, brunette.  She comes out to me one day.  The phone rang.  She came out to give me the phone in her bra and panties.  I almost dropped it.  See?  I told you.  Maybe because it's okay.  You're dad.  It's just dad.  He doesn't think of me like that. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, she's innocent.  And she's like, oh, the phone's for him.  He's my new dad.  I just happen to be in my bra and panties getting ready to whatever, take a shower.  Dude, what's your first name?  What did she call you?  She just called me Doug.  Doug?  So it's like, Doug, the phone, Doug.  And Doug's just going, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, okay.  I'll take that phone.  Puts the pillow from the couch on his lap. 
[00:12:30]  Why is he always walking around the house with an overcoat over his lap?  You know, I just think it rains in the living room.  Doug, the phone's for you.  I'll bring it over.  Yeah.  It matters where she, I'm a driver.  So she used to go on the road with me once in a while.  So I'm living in this little tin can with this sexy, you know, 16 at the time.  Right.  Living in this tin can with this sexy little 16-year-old.  And she used to dress very provocatively.  So fast forward about a year, I come home from being on the road. 
[00:13:00]  Her mother's out doing something.  She's there by herself.  I walk in the front door, and there she is on the couch with her boyfriend in the throes of passing.  I get a complete eyeful.  I don't know whether to yell at her or help her.  Grab the camcorder.  No, I don't want you to yell.  Hey, you, that's terrific.  Hey.  See, these are the stories we know are happening out there.  Thank you, Mongo.  We go more with you, but your phone is kind of bothering people.  It's a little early for that.  It wasn't such a good story.  We'd have bailed on that just because of his phone. 
[00:13:30]  Absolutely.  You know, I'd like to know, too.  I know that, like, and again, when you've got, like, a 16-year-old girl, are any of the times the girls, I'm sure a lot of times are aware that you're attracted to them or whatever,  do any times they like it and kind of, like, you know, encourage it or tease it or just, you know, go way above and beyond just to get you to look?  I'm sure sometimes they do that, too.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, let's go to Jim in Buffalo.  Jim?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up?  Hey, I've been listening to your show since you've been on in Buffalo.  Yep.  On my morning drive home.  Yep.  And it seems like you guys get censored quite a bit. 
[00:14:00]  What do you mean censored?  Now, who's censoring us?  They better not be censoring out there in Buffalo because we've got Al down the hall that takes care of all the edgy stuff.  Not the edgy stuff, but the stuff that'll get us in trouble, I guess, with the FCC.  It seems like your colors are getting cut off quite a bit and stuff.  I don't know if that's...  Well, the first call was a little questionable.  I don't know if they allowed all that to go through, but obviously the guy got way turned down when his stepdaughter entered the room.  I know what he's talking about.  What you're talking about, sir, it's an FCC thing, a safety thing. 
[00:14:30]  It's called OPE.  It's just hanging up on people.  Oh, yeah.  It could be asked another thing.  He thinks we're being censored.  No, that's just...  It's a regulatory board called OPE's right finger.  You know what, Jim?  We're going to look into this.  I want Steve to call the station, well, the edge in Buffalo and see if they're censoring on their end.  OPE.  No station should be censoring on their end.  We've got Al down the hall.  He makes a very good living to make sure everything is safe.  We should know, by the way, what is going through and what isn't. 
[00:15:00]  Didn't you take your test last night?  Tonight, didn't you take your FCC test last night online?  What test?  You get the little link.  Didn't Tom send you the link?  You click on it.  You put in your code words and your password, and then it gives you questions, multiple choice questions.  I took it online with PalTalk people.  Did you really?  Yeah, I cheated.  I gave the questions to the PalTalk people, and they were awful with their answers. 
[00:15:30]  Can you do mine?  No, that's cheating.  Well, that email I got from Tom, I went like this.  Oh, an email from Tom.  Hmm.  Delete.  Well, there was a link in there I think you needed.  Oh, well.  I'll forward it to you so you can take the test.  It's fun.  Yeah.  When you get something right.  Fun with the FCC.  It says, congratulations, you're right.  And then a man in an office chair spins around happily.  I kid you not. 
[00:16:00]  This test was made up by, I guess, you know, CBS lawyers, Lehrman.  And they know what entertainment is.  And let me give you a little hint.  Just default to they fine you for everything.  You'll be good.  Oh, really?  They'll give you an example of a little scenario, and then they'll give you what the FCC might  do under those circumstances.  Just go to the worst possible thing that the FCC could do, and you'll be right.  You know what they should do?  And then I would definitely take the test.  If I get a really good score, you're allowed to take a samurai sword and lop their heads 
[00:16:30]  off down in Washington.  Well, that'd be nice.  Not the FCC, because, you know, you can't mess with them.  They could put stuff in your food that gives you cancer.  But I'm talking about the lawyers that run this radio show.  Oh, all those guys.  Yeah, the corporate lawyers.  Lop their heads off if you get a good score.  Well, it was very exciting.  I finished the test, I passed, and I printed out my certificate, my certificate that completed  it.  I held it up to the PalTalk camera. 
[00:17:00]  I was congratulated by everyone on PalTalk as I summarily ripped it to pieces and threw  it away.  All right.  It was very fun.  Hey, Jim, we're going to find out what's going on with Buffalo.  I hope they're not doing some dumping on their end.  One dump so far.  We'll find out, though.  Thank you, Jim.  That's what we got.  Yeah, one dump on our end, and it should have been done.  I know what it was.  The guy got a little too graphic.  He just was so worked up.  He wanted to take it to, you know, he couldn't just leave well enough alone.  He had to take it that one step further by making people, you know, making it obvious 
[00:17:30]  what had happened.  And you know what that one step was?  Can't tell you.  Can't tell you.  But the XMers know.  Wah!  They didn't censor on XM.  Wah!  Oh, now you're going to get yelled at.  I know.  I love being yelled at, though.  It goes right through me.  Let's see.  Damn.  There was a guy that said, my stepmom is really hot, but they hung up. 
[00:18:00]  The stepmom?  Yeah.  That's an odd situation.  Sonny Ferelli wants to blow up our spot.  Hey, Sonny.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  So long.  Bye.  He goes, I raised my stepdaughter from infancy, and I can't look at her that way.  Well, that's what we were saying.  Well, we don't need you today.  We were saying it.  Sonny's wife is very attractive.  But quite a looker?  Yeah.  That has to be some kind of an overseas slave ship.  She's really good-looking. 
[00:18:30]  She's very nice, too.  I talked to her at FH Riley's.  Oh, baby.  You know, my brother's restaurant out there in Huntington Village.  Of course.  Where the hell is it?  Huntington Village.  Ah, 400 New York Avenue.  But why say it?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to OT in Jersey.  What's up, OT?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  Good morning.  Hey, talking about the stepdad situation, when my wife and I got together about five years  ago, my stepdaughters were 14 and 18, and I was the first man that had been in the house 
[00:19:00]  for about 10 years.  They had the tendency to run around in their nothings.  What do you mean, their nothings?  Like, totally nude?  As close to nude as possible.  Totally nude stepdaughter.  Totally nude.  That would be a great name for a punk band.  Nude stepdaughter.  Nude.  You mean like, you know, some flimsy wear?  Yeah.  Definitely flimsy wear.  And a bit of innocence as they're wearing it, right? 
[00:19:30]  Tee-hee.  Innocence.  Because the girls today, they have no idea how slutty they really look.  Because it's just a fashion thing.  They see Britney Spears dressing like she does.  This is where it started, by the way.  And Paris Hilton added to it.  And now all these young girls walk around like sex slaves.  Yeah.  And they have no clue, though.  They have no clue what they do to guys.  They go to the mall with their moms.  They get out of their Dodge Dart and make sure they show everything under their skirt.  They're not wearing anything. 
[00:20:00]  They do the Paris Hilton.  You're Paris Hilton.  There's cameras around.  You're not showing anybody.  You're giving a poor guy over here a stroke because he's looking at you.  They have no clue.  You know what I'm going to do this summer?  I'm going to start a new trend, being that we are celebrities.  Yeah.  I'm going to wear real loose-fitting shorts.  And I'm going to get out and just, like, really spread them wide.  Yeah.  And see if any paparazzi want to take some pictures.  I'm going to see if it works both ways.  Let's do the oopsie. 
[00:20:30]  Where you can just see, you know, brain.  I bet you no paparazzi.  But I bet you Jane Goodall would like to take a look.  Hairy ape.  Yeah, we have no doubt in our minds that Ant's really packing.  It's just a hairy mess.  Yeah.  It's not a hairy mess.  Maybe not a mess.  I'm not, like, Middle Eastern.  Yeah.  Or anything like that.  Like, my chest is very indicative of how hairy my body is.  It's not very.  What's the top of the chest? 
[00:21:00]  It's not very.  See?  Oh, you're wispy.  See?  He's shaved.  Wispy.  No, no, I don't.  You don't shave that?  No.  All right.  No.  Kind of wispy.  All right.  Let's go to OT in Jersey and get the.  So, OT, anything else to add?  Just that there was a nude swim party one night that I didn't know about.  I came home from work.  I drive a truck, and I got home about 9 o'clock one Friday night.  Walked into the backyard to about 15 naked little girls running around my backyard. 
[00:21:30]  What'd you do, sir?  Did you stand in the kitchen window and peek at them, or you didn't stop it, did you?  No.  Hell no.  I didn't stop it.  I walked inside and attacked my wife.  I have a friend.  It was the only outlet I had, guys.  All right.  Very good, OT.  It reminds me, and I kind of mentioned it a little earlier.  I have a friend who has, you know, a young daughter, and it's his own around that age  of 15 or 16, and that happened.  She decided to have some friends over for a pool party. 
[00:22:00]  A sleepover, a pool party.  And they thought it would be a lot of fun, but the backyard is filled with 15 or 16-year-olds,  and this guy's daughter is one of them.  And they all decided it'd be really crazy and fun to run completely around the house  naked.  That's a go for kids.  And this friend of mine, and I wish I could blow up his spot.  I'll call and see if I can.  Because you know the guy was just losing his mind.  He's in the living room just watching, like, naked girls run around his house, and he's running 
[00:22:30]  from room to room to try to keep up with him.  I'd have had cameras set up like a Bruckheimer film.  But it was like 20 cameras around the house.  But to the girls, it was just the, ah, fun, you know?  To him, it was like, I was thinking things that I probably shouldn't think.  He's staying there repainting the baseboards.  And he's running around the house from window to window, taking in all that goodness. 
[00:23:00]  Just running around inside the house like a hamster.  Why is dad following us from window to window, like, oh my god.  Then you're teehee, then you're teehee, teehee.  The naked guy behind them, giggling and laughing like one of the girls.  Anyway, it's Stepfather Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Steve, put this together, quickie.  Stepfather Day.  Stepfather Day.  Talking about stepdaughters.  Your asshole, your asshole, your older man, and hating women, again, on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:23:30]  That's stupid Steve.  I love Steve.  He's a buffoon.  He's a clod.  You want one more before we take a break?  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Yeah, well, actually, I'm not married to her.  But I've been with her for about two, two and a half years.  And actually, I'm her daughter's godfather.  And her dad, her real dad, is in prison right now. 
[00:24:00]  Now, this all makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he was actually, like, my best friend.  We don't really talk too much now, if you can understand.  You know, but, yeah, she had a little party because she just turned 17.  She had a party.  How long have you been with the girl's mother?  How old was she, John?  No, no, two years.  Okay.  Continue.  Go, go, go.  Yeah, yeah.  No, well, she was having a party, right?  So she had all her girlfriends over there, about 16, you know, 17, around that age and everything. 
[00:24:30]  Well, you know, they're all getting in the pool.  And this one girl jumps off the diving board.  Whole top comes off.  She's got areolas the size of silver dollars.  And I'm loving it.  I'm sitting there like, you know, oh, yeah.  I'm like, yeah, tell your friends to come over all the time.  She's like, why?  I'm like, what?  Hey, all right, fellas.  All right.  Good job.  Wow.  How fantastic.  Apparently, she had her friend jumped in the pool and her top came off. 
[00:25:00]  She had very attractive.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Let's just keep it at that.  What he was saying.  Yes.  Ah, who knows?  Who knows, Jimmy?  Yeah.  You know, I took the test last night.  I know.  You've got to be really careful.  I know it could be a little too descriptive.  All right.  And CokeLogic sent this in.  Bing, bing, bing.  Stepfather Day.  Look out, stepdaughters.  It's stepfather's day.  Bye-bye.  Stepfather Day.  Bing, bing.  Talking about stepdaughters. 
[00:25:30]  That's right.  Infectious.  Listeners getting involved with their own little sweepers for stepfather day.  People seem to have enjoyed the Steve impression.  We've got a party pooper on the line.  Mike in Queens, what's up?  First of all, I'm not a party pooper.  You're a party pooper.  What's the matter, Mike?  You guys written me a new one.  All right.  When Hanson was on, I called you.  I was the last guy that called.  Calling me an idiot.  I'm going to see you on the show and this and that and everything. 
[00:26:00]  But come on now.  You guys are like laughing it up and these are pervs calling, aren't they?  They're all looking at 15-year-olds.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you something.  It's not pervs.  You didn't listen to the intro to Stepfather Day.  This is basic.  I heard it from the beginning.  Yeah, but Mike, you don't understand.  This is basic human nature.  But you guys are talking about 15-year-old areolas and stuff and you guys are laughing it up.  These guys are pervs.  This is basic human nature we're talking about.  It's a guy coming into a relationship.  Well, don't let me talk.  Mike is basically saying you guys are phonies promoting Stepfather stuff. 
[00:26:30]  Don't let me talk then.  Don't let me talk.  Will you let Anthony talk?  Because I can explain this to you if you would just listen for a moment.  We're talking about basic human nature.  This is a guy coming into a relationship that is brand new.  He doesn't know this girl from a hole in the wall.  We're not talking about girls that are 16 and 17-year-olds that look like they're 12.  We're talking about developed women, girls that are developed, that look attractive, that look like models. 
[00:27:00]  And this guy is walking into this relationship with the mother and he's not supposed to be a human being, a man, and look at that and go, oh, my God, is she beautiful?  We're not talking about touching them.  What are these decoys saying on the computer to those guys?  Totally different.  Totally different.  They're not acting on it, you nut.  Yeah, we're not talking about the pervs out there that are actually, you know, acting on their impulse and stuff.  But basically we're saying this. 
[00:27:30]  Shut up, dude.  Jesus, shut your mouth.  Mike's a little too, let me tell you about Mike.  Mike's a little too maybe close to this situation.  Maybe this is upsetting Mike a little bit.  Maybe Mike's getting a little turned on by this whole thing.  Mike could be in a similar situation at his house and he really is close to acting on it.  I don't know.  But that seems to be the way somebody would react.  This is sensitive material and it's got to be presented just right and we know how to do this. 
[00:28:00]  This is just a guy walking into a house with a new girlfriend and all of a sudden a daughter is just hot.  What are you going to do?  All of a sudden the daughter goes, the phone's for you and she's in, you know, a bra and panty.  In her underwear.  And you're telling me that you're not going to be gulping going, oh my God.  She's model hot and you've known her for like a month.  Right.  What the hell are you stupid?  And we don't want the stories where you're sneaking in bed with her at night and doing all that horrific crap.  That's not the point of stepfather day. 
[00:28:30]  That's right.  And by the way, the girl whose top came off and she had the great rack.  She was 17, stupid.  And if you're going to tell me that seeing a 17-year-old's top come off isn't going to turn you on because the state says it's not okay until you're 18.  You're a liar.  It actually does.  I think New York is 17.  You can actually have sex with a girl that's 17.  You can't photograph them until they're 18.  I don't know if you know if you can have sex with them unless you're an X amount of years old or younger.  Of course you can.  No, no, no.  You can't be like that.  I don't think you can be 30 years older than a 17-year-old. 
[00:29:00]  It's kind of scary that Anthony knows all those laws.  You can.  I'm not saying it's legal.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  That kind of phony call really annoys me.  I'm not trying to take a community stand, stupid.  We're not talking about 10-year-olds.  No.  You know that.  Stop it.  I think most people understand exactly what we're talking about today.  So, good morning to the stepfathers with the hot stepdaughters.  You know what it is?  He's probably got stuck.  I bet you his wife has a fat kid.  I'll bet you he's got a fatty and he's jealous.  Oh, I didn't even think of that way.  He's jealous because he's got a, ugh.  Mike's got a little pork rind eater running around the house just shoving fattening food into a little piece. 
[00:29:30]  Do you have any attractive friends?  Yeah.  Could you bring them over, please?  I'll bet you.  This is what happened.  When they first met, my daughter's having a slumber party, and when he went over, it was like a scene out of Wild Kingdom.  Why am I involved in this?  All right, Stepfather Day continues on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:30:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Good morning and welcome to Stepfather's Day.  Big hi to all the stepfathers out there.  Doesn't anyone effing knock anymore?  All right, Hamilton.  Wow, man.  We try to talk about what's going on in the world, and the phones are like crickets. 
[00:30:30]  You talk about hot stepdaughters.  Look at these phones.  Look at these phones.  People trying to get in.  Let's say hi to Tony in Philly.  What's up, Tony?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was married to a stripper, and her thing was, you usually walk around the house naked,  so I guess her daughter kind of got used to it.  Well, after a while, you know, her daughter got older, and now she's 17, and he used to 
[00:31:00]  do it constantly.  And what made it worse was, as I used to hear her in a room talking on the phone, oh, my  mom's husband is so hot.  You know, my mom's husband is so hot, her mom would be working at night, and she would  take a shower, you know, come out and sit down on the couch and talk to me and everything  else.  It was absolute murder.  But she would walk around the house naked?  Oh, yeah.  She would do it on purpose, too.  Her mom would be at work.  I would do construction.  I'd be home.  Excuse me.  I'd be home.  She's getting all choked up just thinking about it. 
[00:31:30]  See, you know what's weird about this stuff?  Like, Mike in Queens, you know, he got us a thinking.  You know, this is the type of thing that does happen out there, but we're not supposed to  talk about it for some reason.  Yeah.  Because, you know, some people will find it very wrong, obviously.  Mm-hmm.  Obviously.  And as well, they probably should.  But this is happening, and we want to hear from the people today.  Oh, and then she used to tell her girlfriends, my stepdad's home, my stepdad's home, you  know what I mean?  You guys come. 
[00:32:00]  So they started to come over, and then they thought it was funny to walk around the house.  You'd be like, yeah, just go ahead.  I'd do it all the time.  Then they're all walking around the house in panties and little t-shirts and stuff, hanging  out.  Oh, yeah.  It was murder.  And she was 16, 17, somewhere around there?  Well, there were seniors in high school at that time.  See?  There you go.  There was 18-year-olds running around now.  Right.  All right.  All right, buddy.  Thank you, Tony.  By the way, age of consent in New York is 17.  No, no, I know, but there was a weird thing with age of consent, where 17 in some places 
[00:32:30]  was it, but you could only be X amount of years older, like five years older or younger.  I think that's for, like, statutory.  Like, if she's 16 and you're 18, they're a lot more lenient than if you're, you know,  40 and she's 16.  Yeah.  There's some kind of, yeah, difference in age if it's a certain amount of years.  But is 17, is it legal for a 30-year-old?  17 is legal.  For a 30-year-old to hook up with a 17-year-old in New York State.  That's the age of consent, 17.  Okay.  All right.  And then in Jersey, it's 16. 
[00:33:00]  It's scary that Dan knows all this stuff.  I think he's wrong.  I think that, I don't think that a 40-year-old, a 40-year-old can have sex with a 16-year-old.  I'm telling you, I think that there's some kind of an age thing there where you have  to be X amount of years older or younger.  There can be a five or six year difference until you're 18.  All right.  Listen.  We'll research it.  Yeah.  Off to instant feedback, Mo Golden from Brooklyn.  This is exactly what we're talking about.  Thank you, Mo, for the help.  Remember the scene in Broken Flowers where the girl hands the phone to Bill Murray? 
[00:33:30]  Bill Murray's dating this teenage girl's mom, obviously.  The mom's not home.  And the phone rings, and all of a sudden, the girl shows up into the living room or the  dining room completely naked to go.  The phone calls for you.  Yeah.  That's exactly what we're talking about today.  Let's say hi to Steve in PA.  Steve?  Good morning, boys.  How are you this morning?  This is kind of like an AA meeting.  You got these stepfathers calling and go, because it says on the comments, I had a hot 
[00:34:00]  stepdaughter.  I'm a stepfather, and I had a hot stepdaughter.  Well, actually, in your case, a hot stepsister, right?  Well, yeah, I'm a stepfather now, but back a couple years back, my father married a younger  woman, and she had a daughter that was only three years younger than me.  I was 19, and she was 16 years old, and that situation there was hot, too.  I mean, you're right at that age group where we could have coupled up and we had girlfriends 
[00:34:30]  coming over all the time.  The Greg Marcia phenomenon, they call that.  Yes, yes.  And that's just as much torture as it is for the stepfather.  I understand the situation that you're talking about with the stepfather, because I have  a stepdaughter now, but back then, I think that was even harder than the father situation.  So you're giving me the creeps.  My sister's here.  That's just gross.  And she's with her girlfriend, and I can't even look over.  It's just uncomfortable.  All right.  Hey, boys.  Frankus.  Yeah.  Oh, Frankus to you.  Diana will not stop calling. 
[00:35:00]  Diana.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I just wanted to tell you that...  Oh, hold on.  Here's the scene from Broken Flowers.  When I saw this film, we were trying to get this video up on our website, and it took forever  for this...  Actually, she doesn't give the phone to Bill Murray.  Now that I'm seeing the scene, I remember Bill Murray's just kind of hanging out in the  house, and all of a sudden, the stepdaughter is on the phone with one of her girlfriends  or whatever, or the daughter of the girl he's dating, and she's just on the phone, completely 
[00:35:30]  naked, walking into the room, talking to one of her friends.  And she doesn't see him there, or she does?  She does.  I think she sees Bill Murray there.  She's doing a little tease and making believe she doesn't really see him.  They all do it.  It's a weapon to use against their mothers.  Look at Bill Murray's face.  He's just like, oh, hi.  That's exactly what we're talking about today.  See, they even did it in movies.  Diana, what's the problem?  You keep calling us.  Well, it's just because I was called my home, because I thought of a better idea.  I thought of a better thing. 
[00:36:00]  My best friend, Christy, used to...  Her and her friend, Emily, used to get in the pool with her stepdad.  And you know how when you're in the pool with your boyfriend, you do that little up-against-the-side-of-the-pool thing?  Well, they used to do that to him all the time.  Him...  They know...  Girls know exactly what they're doing.  Wait, what up-against-the-pool thing?  They wouldn't be sexual.  You know when you're at the pool with your girlfriend?  And you kind of go...  You put your back against the edge of the pool, and she, like...  I don't know, straddles you, I guess. 
[00:36:30]  Okay, yeah, you're just making out or whatever.  You're right.  Well, yeah.  They would do that to him all the time.  They knew what they were doing.  Like, he would be just leaning up against the side of the pool, and they would get uncomfortably close.  Right?  Yes.  Yeah, there you go.  Why?  And they knew...  What?  Did she like the stepfather like that, or was she just being...  It was like a game to them.  Okay.  Yeah, that's what we're talking about, too.  Some of these stepdaughters know exactly what they're doing.  They all do.  It's like a...  Look, what it is, is once a girl hits a certain age, she's not the mother... 
[00:37:00]  The mother doesn't look at her as a daughter anymore.  It's like another woman.  It's an enemy, I guess.  Yeah, but wouldn't a lot of girls find that creepy?  Like, you're saying that, like, she was enjoying it, but I know a lot of girls would find that disgusting  or creepy if they thought their stepfather was looking at him any other way, but, like,  you know...  Well, that's the other thing...  But then they have power over their mom.  But this is the other thing we're talking about today.  The stepfathers are not acting on this, and they're not even...  They're doing everything they can to show that they're not, you know, interested in this 
[00:37:30]  whole thing that's going on in front of them.  But they're men.  But inside, they're like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's exactly what we're talking about today.  When I was 16 years old, my mom...  Me and my mom are walking down the street, right?  She meets my future...  Well, he wasn't yet, but my future stepfather.  But whenever him and her split up a little while ago, he told her that whenever he saw  us, he wanted to pick me up and not her.  And I was only 16.  And then, even though she already was, like, a bit of... 
[00:38:00]  She was mean to me anyway before that.  But then, now, she can't see me.  All right.  You're running out of steam there, Diana.  Thank you.  You still have a nice voice, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Tony the Trucker.  Tony, what's going on?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  You know, it's not even as much of the issue of me looking at them.  It's the friends. 
[00:38:30]  The friends.  It's the friends that come over for the overnight sleep parties.  It's the friends that come over to go to the beach in the summer with the dark bikinis.  You know what I mean?  That's what really kills you.  Yeah.  Where they come over for little sleepovers and getting their jammies.  Wearing the little tennies, running around, hitting each other with pillows.  Yeah.  That stuff that gets you, you know, makes you sweat inside.  All right.  See?  Tony's being on it.  Have a good one, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Jim in Brooklyn. 
[00:39:00]  Jim Norton's sister is in studio today.  And Jim in Brooklyn has something for you.  What's up, Jim?  Picture your sister naked.  No.  No.  No.  Oh, Jimmy.  Payback as a bitch.  No.  Look at her.  At least look at her and say hi.  Jim's not even entertaining this as any type of humor.  At least just look at her.  No.  No.  You haven't said hi to her yet.  No.  Of course you did.  We waved when she walked in.  What happened, Jim? 
[00:39:30]  All right, look at this legal age of consent.  Something happened maybe years ago, and that's what makes you uncomfortable looking at each other.  Yeah, I was raised properly by nice people.  The fact that I'm disgusting in my...  All right, let's go to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Good morning, fellow.  Hey.  Hey, man.  I got to try to say this so I'm in compliance.  It just happened a couple of nights ago, and it's not...  My stepdaughter's a big, fat mess, but I don't want to... 
[00:40:00]  I can barely tolerate looking at her with all her clothes on, but her friend...  Oh, my God.  This might really thrill Jimmy, too.  Let's say we got an L-shaped bathroom, and, like, if only one light's on, it looks like, you know, the lights are off, but nobody's in.  And I had to use it really bad, so I just, you know, threw the door open, snapped on the light.  And, well, her girlfriend has spent the night, and she's 18, and she's just gotten out of the bathtub and was, oh, boy, grooming her cat. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  And...  I don't think that'll wash.  Hold on.  Ah.  We got a yield sign.  Why?  Okay.  It's just too much.  Yeah, we got a yield sign.  All you'd have to do is say...  Anthony took the test yesterday.  He's way up on this this morning.  It's nay.  Oh, sorry.  All we got to say, all you'd have to say is...  Sorry, Tom.  She had just taken a bath, and she was, you know, grooming herself.  Ah.  That's it.  That can mean anything.  She could be brushing her hair. 
[00:41:00]  She could be brushing her teeth.  She could be doing her nails, doing a little clip job.  And the you know part is like, that's the kicker.  That's right.  And she was, you know, grooming herself.  It's not like...  And she was grooming herself.  Then you picture her in front of the mirror, brushing her hair or something.  When you say you know, I'm thinking cleaning out the ears.  Right, Q-tips.  That's the you know that I'm thinking.  You might be thinking something else.  But keep it right there, Max.  So you walked in on this.  Yeah.  And she shared a similar physical attribute that Jimmy likes. 
[00:41:30]  Not unlike China Doll.  Yes.  All right.  Stop right there.  Wow.  Another yield.  Slow down.  All right.  And you walked in on all this.  Yes.  And let's say about two hours later, I was like Brad on Fast Time.  I don't blame you.  All right.  There you go.  Do you still see her or no?  Bono.  All right.  Thank you.  He already yelled Bono.  He can't say another word.  Now, here's the other side of this.  Lindsay in Boston. 
[00:42:00]  She, I believe, calls a lot.  Right, Lindsay?  I've only called once before, actually.  That's a lot for a girl on this show.  Were we trying to give you a prize?  No.  Oh, that was another one.  All right.  All right.  What's going on today?  You're 17.  You've got a creepy stepfather.  Yeah, like really creepy.  He used to, when I was like 14 or 15, he used to like open my bedroom door in the middle  of the night and just like watch me.  Oh, creep.  He was concerned you had apnea. 
[00:42:30]  And I used to be like, can I help you?  And he wouldn't say anything.  Yeah.  He wouldn't leave.  And this happened a couple of weeks ago, actually.  I was, we got new doors now of locks, thank God.  And I was in the shower.  It was just me and him home.  And I was in the shower and I had locked the bathroom door and he came like knocking  on the door.  And I'm like, can I help you?  And he's like, are you in the shower?  And I was like, yeah.  Why do you have the door locked?  Because I'm in the shower.  And I'm scared of you. 
[00:43:00]  And he's like, what if there's a fire and I need to get you out?  Ew.  I'm like, I think it's...  You're in water.  What better place could it be for a fire?  Yeah, no kidding.  Just be standing there, burnt building around you, firemen holding their helmets over their  laps.  That's only fair if you have a room full of shredded paper and you're in there and he  says, well, there's a fire.  Yeah.  Could you leave me alone?  I'm putting the cap on the gas cap.  And he's always telling me like, you look very beautiful today.  And I'm like, ugh.  See, these are the stories that are going to wreck stepfather. 
[00:43:30]  Creep.  I just made it.  No, it's going to wreck stepfather's day.  Because we're trying not to go down the creepy road.  But does mommy know there, Lindsay?  Yeah, I told her.  And she's like, I'll talk to him.  And then he goes like, oh, I didn't know I reacted like that.  How old are you?  He called you a little rat.  Called you a little rat.  A little rat slut, didn't he?  I don't know.  He's creepy.  She'd walk around in a park all day.  Well, good luck to you.  Yeah, really?  Yep.  All right.  Tell him you have a VD or something. 
[00:44:00]  That's what you ought to do.  Good, so do I.  Seriously, you ought to come home and go like, I got herpes or whatever.  Yeah, but then he's going to tell mom and tell me the whole thing.  Explain to mom what happened.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll take another break.  We've got to catch up a little bit.  We're going to talk about other things as we continue Stepfather's Day.  You got Bush there.  Ah, he's a stand-up comedian now.  Bush is hysterical.  We'll do it after the break.  Every year, the president gets to tell some jokes at the radio and television correspondence  dinner.  Yeah.  It just seems a little weird when we're at war. 
[00:44:30]  It should definitely be.  He shouldn't attend is what it is during this time.  We'll get into that.  Also, Sanjaya made it through an American Idol last night.  It's all these dumb radio shows that think they have something to do with it.  You don't.  Yes, stop.  You don't.  He's on the front page of the paper today.  He's getting massive attention from all walks of life, all over America.  Everybody's talking about Sanjaya.  And for you to go on your radio show and be pompous enough to think you're the one controlling 
[00:45:00]  it is ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.  Yep.  Sanjaya is controlling it himself.  You go on national TV with that whacked out mohawk, of course you're staying on the show.  Yeah.  Because that's what everyone's going to talk about.  The guy's making more news than any other contestant ever has.  He's smart.  A marketing company should hire him as soon as he gets booted off eventually.  Yeah.  Because he knows what he's doing.  That kid knows what he's doing.  What do you think?  All the way?  You think he's going to go?  No, no, no.  Eventually.  I mean with another man.  Has he been all the way? 
[00:45:30]  No, eventually he gets voted off.  I think the people behind the scenes of American Idol, you know.  It's kind of like voting for the president.  We don't really freaking vote for the president.  You get someone that's a little crazy in there.  Ah, they do their thing behind closed doors.  That's what's going to happen on American Idol.  They're going to do their thing behind closed doors when Sanjaya, like...  What, you're saying Oswald's going to shoot him?  Ah, Sanjaya's going to out.  Ruby.  He's going to...  It's going to be done.  They don't need him anymore for ratings and all that. 
[00:46:00]  Because ratings are a little bit down right now, so they're enjoying the Sanjaya thing.  Yeah.  But eventually they're going to be like, all right, enough.  This has run its course, and now it's back to a singing competition.  You watch.  No one else is really a standout.  That's why, you know, as far as personality-wise goes.  True.  So he'll be there for maybe another week or two, and then he'll finally get booted.  But it has nothing to do with a radio show or anything else.  It's America is talking about Sanjaya.  Yeah.  We weren't going to talk about American Idol this year.  We decided behind the scenes, like, it's not worth it, but we're talking about it even 
[00:46:30]  because this is, like, so over-the-top, this kid, in many, many ways.  There they are, Sean McGon on TV.  Yeah, there he is.  Uh-huh.  You don't see any of the other contestants.  He did that mohawk, and now every news channel in America has to show that.  He's smart.  Yep.  It's brilliant.  Even Simon is flirting with him.  It's kind of gross.  Batting his eyes at him.  Yeah.  It's brilliant.  It really is.  He knows what he's doing.  More to come.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  That's right.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Stepfather's Day.  The phones are lit.  The instant feedback is going nuts.  They're talking about it in Pal Talk.  You're listening to the radio a little more today.  I'll tell you some feedback.  Trucker Gunny from Texas.  He writes, you come into the kitchen for coffee one morning,  and there are four 16- to 18-year-olds in the kitchen in panties and tank tops. 
[00:47:30]  And they think nothing of it because this has been status quo since they were 10 at my house.  Yeah, see?  See what happens.  That's what these stepfathers got to deal with.  We'll take more of your calls in a few minutes here.  But first, we've got to talk about that video that's on Good Morning America and everywhere else today.  Oh, no.  I don't think I can.  I guess it's the radio and television correspondence dinner.  It happened last night down there in Washington.  They get the press together.  Oh, it's when the politicians get to just let their hair down. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  They go wild.  And it's amazing how funny and hip and relevant they are and their comedy is.  It's just amazing.  I got a real problem with this.  You know, we brush it under the rug how many Americans die every day in Iraq.  You barely hear a peep about it.  And they're showing, like, a video of President Bush just telling jokes and laughing and stuff. 
[00:48:30]  Telling jokes.  Yeah, I got some jokes.  Just a little weird to me, I guess.  I don't know.  The podium in his tuxedo.  And then they're-  A little black tie.  Just telling jokes.  And then they're dancing on stage at the end of this.  Yeah, there's a big dance number.  Who is dancing?  Carl Rove?  Oh, yeah.  He's dancing and he's calling himself MC Rove or something?  Don't even say it.  I can't.  MC Rove.  It's a rap parody.  I cannot look at it.  I've looked at the video on the TV, but the sound is down. 
[00:49:00]  I can't imagine what it sounds like.  No, no.  Don't give me the thumbs up, Sam.  It's just so embarrassing to watch.  They should not-  You know, we said this just before.  They should-  Maybe some people not show up at these things.  Maybe President Bush should say, you know something, in light of current world events, I'm going to decline coming to this party.  The invitation. 
[00:49:30]  I don't think it would be appropriate at this time.  Just give that.  And, of course, the press would jump on it.  What's inappropriate about it?  You got a problem?  It's business as usual, though.  You know, you get to be the president.  You want to enjoy all the fun stuff, too.  In my world, I think if you're the president and there's a war going on, unfortunately, you don't get to do all the fun stuff.  No fun stuff.  You got to be in that Oval Office every day doing your job and not doing a black tie thing and making sure your jokes are really good. 
[00:50:00]  I mean, come on.  You've been looking at that in the Middle East, just laughing at us.  Of course.  Horses' asses in the cabinet, just laughing and doing a rap parody.  And they're over there wiring explosive devices to put on the side of the roads.  It's like Rocky III.  He's acting like Sylvester Stallone in the hotel lobby working out.  And meanwhile, Clubber Lang is down in the basement doing chin-ups.  That's right.  That's right.  I'll show you real, man.  Come here.  Hey, woman.  That's right.  That's what Iran's doing.  That's what they're all doing right now. 
[00:50:30]  They're working out in the basement.  And we're...  North Korea, the Chinese.  We're dancing around.  Yeah.  We're dancing around to some bad song.  We don't have to try anymore.  We're the best.  Right?  We're the best, right?  Yeah.  Here it is.  Well, this is when he was really working out.  I think that his brother sang the song.  Yeah, I know.  This is awful.  Yeah.  Clubber Lang was working out in the basement.  Look at Karl Rove. 
[00:51:00]  And Karl Rove is jumping around like a friggin' idiot.  Like a faggot.  Fruit.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, like a fruit.  The black guy can actually dance, of course.  I had a kinkachu.  It's a little cute animal.  Non-threatening at all.  Thank you.  Well, you guys want to hear the president telling jokes?  Damn it.  You want to hear the president telling jokes?  Please. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Here he is.  By the way, George Bush will be on the virus tour with us.  He's hysterical.  Might as well.  Might as well.  Well, where should I start?  A year ago, my approval rating was in the 30s.  My nominee for the Supreme Court had just withdrawn.  And my vice president had shot someone.  Ah, those were the good old days.  Oh! 
[00:52:00]  Now we're going to do something extremely fun.  Really?  That was a funny line, though.  Who wrote that?  Yeah, that's the other thing that America needs to know.  He doesn't write these things.  I sit down all night.  A new material.  That's what I do.  He's got writers that hand him this stuff, knowing it's going to be good.  Like, thank my writer Rich Voss.  Want to buy a tank door? 
[00:52:30]  More Bush.  Democrats trying to get me to sign off on a bill, and I'm dodging them.  Oh, there's the dancing.  Oh, no.  Stop with the dancing.  He's doing kind of like that.  He's trying to do an old school, like, run DMC kind of dance.  But it looks like...  He's swinging his arms around.  He's jumping like an idiot.  The black man on the stage with him has got to turn in his Negro card also.  He is not allowed to call himself a black man. 
[00:53:00]  What is he doing there?  It's kind of like a walk like an Egyptian type of dance, too.  The black guy can dance.  He's like one of the spinners.  At least he has some kind of moves.  His hands are moving in a lovely fashion.  Of course, but why is he there with Karl Rove?  The black guy can't dance.  No.  He's taking it down a notch.  He looks like he can dance because Karl Rove is just so over-the-top bad.  Is that Colin Quinn?  The black guy is actually not dancing well on purpose because he's just embarrassed because 
[00:53:30]  he doesn't want everybody going, oh, of course, you know.  Right, the black guy has rhythm, but Karl Rove, he's having a seizure.  The black guy realizes that he's in the white man's world, so he's like, oh, I got to dance  like a whitey.  Yeah.  If I dance like I know how to dance, they're going to kick me out of this club.  Karl Rove.  Oh, no, they're rapping.  MC Rove.  Do we have audio of this?  Is the white guy that has the mic now, because there's a white guy that has a mic.  Is he rapping? 
[00:54:00]  Dude, we got the clip.  Let's move on here.  But I have to know, we have to identify the people.  Like, who's rapping?  Karl Rove is dancing and someone else is rapping about him, right?  But then he hands the mic over to Karl as Karl says his name.  He's going to say something.  Oh, God.  But first, more jokes from the president of the United States of America.  Got a joke.  Speaking of subpoenas, it's good to see Speaker Pelosi tonight. 
[00:54:30]  Killing.  You know, some have wondered how the two of us would get along.  Some say she's bossy.  She's opinionated.  She's not to be crossed.  Hey, I get along with my mother.  He's cracking him up.  Oh, good Lord.  Okay, terrific.  He's killing, though.  Oh, he's having like an eight and a half, nine.  Okay.  Well, if you're the president, don't you think you could get the best joke writer? 
[00:55:00]  He's got the timing.  Hey, get along with my mother.  You might be a redneck.  When your Aussie was there, he introduced Ozzy Osbourne.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Dope.  He's right there in the audience.  Let me tell you.  If you got a quagmire of a war halfway around the world and you're telling jokes, you might  be a redneck.  How many people? 
[00:55:30]  How many people are just getting exploded while he was doing this?  Someone doesn't agree with us.  Oh, no.  Let their voice be heard.  Tim in Pennsylvania, go ahead.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, two of the most irrelevant people complaining about irrelevance.  I mean, listen, let the guy be a human being, for God's sake.  Excuse me.  Please explain yourself.  I'm from the school that the president should not be a human being while he's a human being.  No, not during a war, you idiot. 
[00:56:00]  You know, you can disagree.  That's fine.  But I don't see it.  It's disrespectful to the men and women that are fighting and dying over there.  What about what you guys do?  What about what you guys do?  We're not the president.  What about we're not the president?  We tell dick jokes, ass.  We know where we're at.  I go back to Russia.  What?  Russia.  He gave us a 1980 response.  Russia's not even around anymore.  Those commies.  Let me shake my fist.  Better red than dead.  Click.  What do you expect from a hippie? 
[00:56:30]  What the hell is wrong with you?  That's a young Republican.  Yes.  Let him be human for a day.  I say no.  No.  I say no.  He respectfully declines the invitation because he's got more important things to worry about.  Do you know that the British are coming?  Oh, no.  They came already.  What?  They have what amounts to hostages.  They're British soldiers, sailors that were taken by the Iranians. 
[00:57:00]  The Iranians say that they were in Iranian water.  They said they were in Iraqi water.  They got all kinds of proof with GPS that they were in Iraqi water.  But they decided not to make an international incident to this and went with the Iranians.  And now the Iranians want them to say that, yes, they were indeed in Iranian water.  Do you know the British government actually came to the American government?  Because you're wondering, why aren't we, like, shaking our little saber and saying, coming out against this?  And asked us, could you please not comment on this? 
[00:57:30]  Could you please stay out of this?  Because world opinion is so goddamn bad that if you guys bring up the American side of this, it's just going to make matters worse.  So stay out of it.  Our number one ally, Britain, England, is telling us to stay out of it.  They're saying, look, we can handle that one.  Yeah, and Bush is telling jokes.  And it's on YouTube now.  MC Rove is on YouTube now.  MC Rove, well, let's bring him out.  Let's go to Max in Dallas. 
[00:58:00]  Max, what's up?  You know the difference between a woman and a toilet?  You don't even have to say the buzz line.  I love the callbacks.  A little callback from yesterday's show.  Hey, take my war, please.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Because I was thinking about this.  I was thinking about the presidents from yesteryear.  Yeah.  And I was wondering if they did the same thing. 
[00:58:30]  Were they kind of like being a human being for a day?  And I was thinking that FDR, you know, didn't do anything crazy while the big war was going on.  The big one.  But Eric reminds me of something here.  Eric in Colorado, go ahead.  Yeah, morning, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, during World War II, FDR was banging a couple of broads on the side.  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  It's been widely talked about.  In fact, he died in the arms of one of his mistresses.  No one's saying that you're not going to do stuff like that.  We're talking about public dancing displays, which I don't think FDR did. 
[00:59:00]  I think it kind of falls into the same category, you know.  Jokes.  You've got to have a little bit of a human moment even during war.  He has human moments.  This is like some, I don't know.  Look, maybe I'm wrong on this, but I just think with everything going on right now,  this doesn't seem to me to be, like, I can't watch him joking.  I'm not looking at it and laughing and going, oh, God, that's good.  I can't watch it without thinking that there's people being exploded. 
[00:59:30]  There's soldiers somewhere in Iraq just scared out of their wits.  Yeah.  Yeah, but, you know, at the same time, too, you look at all the pressure and stress the president's under,  he's got to do something to have a little bit of levity.  Well, let him do it in his private life, dude.  It's embarrassing to have a bunch of these jackasses and tuxes dancing and doing a little rap.  No one's saying don't be a human being, but you know what?  Have a little dignity when the fact that you're authorizing people to be over there getting shot and there would be headings. 
[01:00:00]  Enough already with this stupid display of he's a person.  We know what he is.  Yeah, we know he's a person.  Obviously, he's a person.  How many soldiers did we lose overnight?  Does anyone know?  Nah, of course not.  Because they don't really mean anything to anyone, right?  Thank you, Eric.  Eric, let's play some more Bush here.  Two Sikhs walk into a bar.  It explodes.  A hundred dead.  Here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here. 
[01:00:30]  Jackass.  No.  But between the Congress and the press, there is a lot of scrutiny on this job.  Not a day goes by that I don't get scrutineered one way or the other.  You know, I'm considering what's next.  President Clinton, of course, wrote a very successful presidential memoirs with 10,000 pages or something.  I'm thinking of something really fun and creative for mine. 
[01:01:00]  You know, maybe a pop-up book.  Consider a number of titles.  Which do you like?  How W Got His Groove Back?  How W Got His Groove Back?  There's just nothing worse than when, like, older people assimilate a little bit with pop culture.  They're trying.  Yeah.  It's 10 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah, that movie.  How old is that?  Yeah.  That's stupid. 
[01:01:30]  And that's the beauty of it.  They're so out of touch.  They think they're being relevant by doing a 10-year reference, something that was 10 years ago.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, all right.  Pop-up book.  Well, we got Vicki in Detroit.  She's mad, too.  Vicki.  All right.  Vic, please.  Be heard, Vicki.  Be heard, Vicki.  His name is Jake.  Vicki from Detroit.  You're on, Vicki.  Be heard.  Hey, you guys.  What's on your mind this afternoon?  Hey, why are you guys bashing Bush this morning? 
[01:02:00]  We just find it a little creepy.  Why not?  That a bunch of older white men are down in Washington in tuxes and doing little rap songs and telling  silly jokes that someone else wrote for them.  Vicki, can I ask you something, honestly?  And give me an honest answer.  Do you think everything Bush does is beyond bashing?  No, no, no, no.  Okay.  Listen, it's all true that his parents should certainly ask the university that he went to  for their money back. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, that's terrific.  Listen, listen, you guys.  This sucks.  Bill back?  We enjoyed your joke.  Yeah, we're still here.  We're hoping for another...  Dosey!  Go ahead.  We have our laughing hats on and the ball's in your court.  There you go.  So, you guys, would you rather have Bill back? 
[01:03:00]  Die.  Yeah.  You made it at least interesting.  Hey, hey, if Bill was back, then he could call in regarding the creepy stepdad thing.  Let me tell you something.  I didn't even know that was a joke.  Vicki, it doesn't mean...  If you criticize Bush on something he's done, it doesn't mean that you want the opposite...  Like, oh my God, get me a liberal Democrat, quickly.  Like, all these people that are calling in to say, what are you bashing Bush for? 
[01:03:30]  Are they right?  Oh, they're liberal.  They're this.  How come when Bush does something stupid that we interpret as stupid, you can't just point  it out without people like you calling and going, would you rather have Clinton back  in?  No.  Clinton's the reason that the Muslims were able to get so much power in the first place.  That's what I say.  It doesn't mean...  You can't criticize this guy.  You can't criticize this guy to some people.  Oh, you can.  Hey, hey, have you guys ever traveled overseas? 
[01:04:00]  Yes, I have.  Yes.  Why?  What's the point?  What?  Yes?  Well, if you guys are aware of cultures then, other than how we live here in the United  States.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  Unimportant cultures.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, whenever...  They have really bad TV.  Yeah.  That's what I learned.  Food stinks.  No, the food's a little better.  Except for France.  A little better.  A little better.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, Vicki, it's just an agenda-driven culture.  Oh, Vicki gets all mad.  She should get mad, stupid white Republicans. 
[01:04:30]  Shut up.  I just hate older white guys in tuxes.  Yeah.  They creep me out.  I don't care if they're Republican, Democrat, Green Party.  Older white guys in tuxes trying to act hip.  That's what we're getting at today.  That's ridiculous.  And sorry, I have people still over in Iraq.  You know, I take it pretty seriously.  How many divisions?  Huh?  Oh.  I thought you were talking about you.  General Opie.  Hi, I'm Greg Hughes.  The man that plays General Opie over in Iraq. 
[01:05:00]  Would I take Clinton over this idiot?  I actually would now.  At this point, I would.  Oh, boy, Jimmy.  I would.  Your approval rating with this show.  Oh, boy.  I would take Clinton over this guy.  Oh, boy.  I keep it neutral, so I try to get as many fans as possible out there.  I would.  I'm becoming more vulnerable.  You want to hear Karl Rove and the rap thing?  This is the video I was talking about.  I don't want to, but we have to.  Finally, we get to this.  Karl Rove dances as someone raps about him.  You see, Tony Snow, by the way, is one of the guys in the background dancing.  Is he?  Yeah, I just noticed Tony Snow.  Was it Tony Snow or Dave? 
[01:05:30]  He's on Imus all the time, and he does the good Tom Brokaw.  Was Tony Snow just told everybody he has liver cancer?  The one on the left is Dave.  Tony Snow is back there.  Maybe he wanted to feel better about himself by doing something that's worse than having liver cancer.  Yeah.  Dancing with Karl Rove.  That's not.  That's David.  I'll show you Tony Snow.  Oh, wait.  That's not the one right there?  Yeah, the one in the background on the left, smiling his last dance.  Believe me, he knows this is the last dinner he'll be attending. 
[01:06:00]  The one dancing is not Tony Snow, though.  In the background, that's not him?  It's David.  Oh, all right.  Tony Snow is tired.  Go to Pal Talk.  They know.  They'll help me instantly.  Dave.  Sleep on the table, Tony Snow.  He's vomiting off the side of the tracks, everyone.  It's a good joke, Jimmy.  I'm sorry to blow up your spine.  I should have just went with it.  No, I thought it was him.  I might have even killed him.  Go down.  It's David.  No one on Pal Talk can help me out.  Maybe they're not watching the video. 
[01:06:30]  We'll have the answer in a second.  But anyway.  Thank you.  Elo just texted me.  Snow wasn't there, so I'm incorrect.  I thought that was Tony Snow.  Was Elo there?  Yes, he probably was.  Probably was.  David Gregory, thank you.  I was going to give someone credit, but then E-Rock turns the screen off.  C-C-S-C-4-4-7.  Thank you.  David Gregory.  E-Rock just gave the head shake with the mouth open.  All right.  He doesn't know.  He can't read my mind.  He's a sweet boy.  He doesn't know.  Eric just wants to be kissed on the cheek.  And Elo probably was there.  They're probably drinking alcohol. 
[01:07:00]  I can't get the reference now.  Elo was at the dinner last night.  Was he?  Maybe we'll have him call the show.  That's an explosive.  Maybe we'll let you call the show today, boss.  Probably get drunk and try to approach the president about the merger and then just throw him down.  Have him removed.  Elo, how you doing?  Here's Karl Rove dancing.  The president's right-hand man, Karl Rove, whose name has been in the middle of several recent heated controversies, 
[01:07:30]  was called up to participate in a rap song and dance and looked at times like he was trying to do a ballet.  Tell me, what is your name?  M.C. Rove.  That's true.  He's crossing his arms.  He's rapping and he's chilling and he's showing his charm.  He will do it without fail.  Get out his gun because he's shooting quail.  This man will never stop.  Look at him jumping up and down and ready to hop.  He's got some much to prove.  Man, tell me, you never thought this man moved. 
[01:08:00]  Doing the dance, the Karl Rove dance.  Doing the dance.  All right, look.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Fair is fair.  Hold on.  Before you say anything?  Before you say anything?  Yeah.  Fair is fair.  We do have black listeners.  A moment of silence to allow the black listeners to openly laugh at their radio.  And go.  The guy was a good rapper.  I mean, lyrically. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  If it was 1980.  Shut up, Jimmy.  70.  88.  I can't appreciate a guy who doesn't rap.  No, you can't.  I know you're just full of crap.  That guy was good.  They just.  Doing the Karl Rove dance.  You know how stupid.  Oh, Sean, I can't sit here.  You know how stupid Whitey looks right now?  I know.  We're busy doing it with computers and we're not good at their awful dancing.  I don't want the stupid non-art form.  You can also see Karl Rove have to sort of tone down his dancing as he concentrates on 
[01:09:00]  his big line.  Like, he's very excited and then MC Rove and he has to tone it down a little bit.  He, I swear to you, he is dancing.  He looks like a retarded child at a carnival.  Like, you can't keep him still.  He's trying to run off to something.  That's what he looks like.  Michael Richards needs to walk on stage with a cordless mic and just redo his last factory  set.  Imagine if Bush got heckled and he goes into Michael Richards mode.  That's right. 
[01:09:30]  I said it.  And that one black guy on the stage dancing, that one black Republican up there yucking it  up.  Believe me, black people, you should hate him.  You should hate him.  Absolutely.  You know that guy could dance, but he's not going to show any of his talents up there.  That's right.  Up on stage.  He's a ****.  He's a ****.  Go ahead.  That's right.  I said it.  I said it.  He's a ****.  Get him out of here.  Get that **** out of here. 
[01:10:00]  That's what Bush did a really tasteless joke.  Look at a C-bomb reference in it.  It smells like fish, a tasty dish.  Let's say hi to Danny in New York.  Danny, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  What's going on, man?  You got a new listener here from Staten Island.  How you doing?  All right?  Pretty good.  We don't know much about Staten Island.  I think they do human experiments.  My fifth favorite burrow.  That's right.  What's going on, bro?  Anyway, listen, man. 
[01:10:30]  I think Bush got his jokes from the phony department over there at Steve Harvey's place.  Yeah, you can't beat him in the phony department.  Thank you, Danny.  All right, guys.  You have a good one, all right?  We love callbacks on this show.  All right.  I thought the jokes were good, but just...  Yeah, but he didn't write them.  I don't know.  Look, man, you know, you don't have to agree with us.  I just find it a little creepy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Stepfather's Day continues.  Oh, of course.  And we'll get into other things.  There's J-Lo. 
[01:11:00]  Now, our listeners might...  Jenny from the block.  Our listeners might be thinking, J-Lo, who gives a crap?  But she went back to the Bronx.  She's Jenny from the block.  And she went back to the Bronx yesterday.  Of course.  She goes back and gives back.  Because she's just like you and me.  She was hanging with her peeps.  Yeah, sure.  That's what she was doing.  Didn't you see it on the news?  All the people that showed up, there were a lot of people there, and she was hanging  with her peeps.  Yeah, just like you and I.  Yeah.  Going back to the old neighborhood, right?  Going back, kicking back with the people in your old neighborhood. 
[01:11:30]  Let's put it this way.  Bush had no security yesterday in Washington because they gave it to J-Lo yesterday.  That's going back to your neighborhood, just like you and I.  They might have actually seen her had they had binoculars.  You know, ignore the rock she got.  She's Jenny from the block.  Right.  And that song is on your iPod, admit it.  As it should be.  It's on my outgoing answering machine message.  Picture your sister naked, Jimmy.  No.  What?  No. 
[01:12:00]  Just take a look at her.  Nope.  She's here today.  No, she's not.  Say hi.  No.  Give her a hug.  I'm going to look at Sam naked.  Give her a hug.  She's right there.  Come on.  No.  Picture your sister naked.  Oh, it was all fun when you made fun of all the way May and grandma's out there.  Did you ever wake up with a breathe right strip on her thigh?  Oh, no.  No offense, but believe me, she's as skeeved as I am. 
[01:12:30]  I can't see her because of the computer monitor, so I don't want to look at her.  Oh, let me move that out of the way.  I'm looking at her.  She doesn't seem too skeeved.  Oh, she's skeeved.  Someone's saying we should add beeps to the President Bush thing.  I don't know.  You might want to try it.  All right.  We got a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  During the break, Anthony and I took a picture with Jimmy's sister. 
[01:13:00]  And Jimmy, she smells lovely this morning.  Ooh.  Does she?  Yep.  We high-five when we see each other.  High-five.  That's right.  We give like a Snoop thing.  We throw up Ws from across the street.  Let's go to Amanda.  Amanda in New York City.  What's up, Amanda?  Hi, guys.  Black Amanda.  Hi, Amanda.  You're black?  Yeah, remember?  Amanda, you all hate me.  Oh.  Wait a minute. 
[01:13:30]  We turned you around?  Hello.  You're the one that is like, you know.  Very pro-black.  Very militant, yes.  Afro-Amanda.  Right.  Well, we have a problem.  Okay.  What's the problem?  I'm enjoying your show.  Oh.  Very funny.  If we turned you around, then we're on to something.  Why did Amanda call?  I know.  She's the one like, ah, like an animal when we talk about the black people.  But you said it's funny today.  Because we were goofing on stupid whitey.  Exactly. 
[01:14:00]  See, we throw it around, Amanda.  We don't have to concentrate on one thing.  Amanda, who is the black guy dancing?  Do you know who he is?  I have no idea, but he does need his Negro card revoke.  Isn't he awful?  Awful.  Dancing around with a bunch of stupid old white guys.  But when white people recognize that a black guy is kind of being an embarrassing sellout,  you really have to be bad.  Oh, yeah.  You bet.  That's bad.  That whole scene is bad when it happens in movies.  When, like, the black guy gets all the stupid white Republicans to dance around the White House or something and rap. 
[01:14:30]  And the old woman is rapping and things like that.  When it's real life, when you're watching it on the news and, oh, my God, this is really happening.  These are our leaders.  It is so embarrassing.  They look like the final scene from Steve Martin's last three movies.  That's a stupid hack.  You know what?  This is why your listener is upset.  A black woman is agreeing with you today.  Yeah.  I kind of like when Amanda is going for our throats.  This is kind of boring when you're, like, on our side.  That's right.  That'll change in minutes. 
[01:15:00]  It'll change by tomorrow, I'm sure.  Tomorrow?  I hope people remember her, man.  She's giving us some classic calls in the last year.  Wait a minute.  Did you call in one time about, like, with a husband or something?  About who?  A husband or a boyfriend.  Yes.  He's white.  He's white.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she was really angry.  Oh, you are hot.  No, I truly love, love white boys.  I love them.  Yeah.  Amanda was hot under the collar that day.  They're sexy.  I love them.  Yeah, and you could kick them around a little bit and make up for a few hundred years. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, we'll show you.  Let's just end this before we screw up.  Yeah, I kind of like that Amanda's loving us today.  Bye, Amanda.  All right, Amanda.  That makes us feel a little good.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, there goes Amanda.  She's very nice.  Hey, we're going to talk about the J-Lo thing really fast.  It's a quickie, but Sam just ran in with some Chuck Lydell audio.  Oh, yeah.  Supposedly, this is really good.  What's up, Sam?  What's going on with our Chuck?  He's been on our show.  Yeah, it's all over the internet now.  It's on great websites like Foundry and Break. 
[01:16:00]  I love smart-ass Sam.  He was on Good Morning Texas, and they had him on to talk about the 300 for some reason.  Well, they fight in it.  Yeah.  Can I interrupt you?  Because it is Stepfather's Day.  Just hold on a minute.  We need to get this on the air somehow, some way.  It's Mike in Pennsylvania.  Mike, it's Stepfather's Day.  Good morning.  What's up, guys?  Welcome aboard, Mike.  Now, you're going to have to be a little careful about how you approach this. 
[01:16:30]  I will do my best.  Give it your best shot and fail miserably.  And this is one reason why we do like being back on regular radio.  It's very interesting to see if we can get some of this through the maze of censors.  Wow.  Wow.  I want to see if this guy has the talent and finesse.  All right.  All right, Al.  All right, let's go, Mike.  You're a stepfather.  You've got a stepdaughter.  What's going on?  16 years old.  I get home from work very early, early one day. 
[01:17:00]  And I go upstairs, and I hear some funny noises coming out of the bedroom.  Funny noises as if...  See, this is where I truly believe I've got to give the listener the benefit of the doubt.  When you say funny noises coming from a room, everyone understands.  Everybody.  Epilepsy.  Okay.  She's the only one in the room.  There you go.  Perfect.  Perfect.  She's the only one in the room. 
[01:17:30]  There are funny noises coming from the room.  What type of funny noise would you say?  But we know...  Funny groans.  Okay.  That's good.  That's good.  That's fine.  She could be practicing dentistry in her room.  But I think the subject at hand, we just know...  Of course.  ...exactly what funny noises mean.  All right.  I think censors are smarter than we give them credit for.  So what is...  Just the opposite.  Yeah, really.  So what did you do now?  I stopped in my tracks at the door.  Yeah.  Curiosity wasn't the best part, but the noises were. 
[01:18:00]  So I stopped.  And all of a sudden, I heard footsteps and the door opened.  Uh-oh.  Well, she was standing there with no top on, in her panties.  And I don't know how to say this clean.  Can I try my best?  Um...  Oh, what the hell?  Give it a shot, you silly goat.  One word at a time, though.  Just go slow.  We're taking bets that I think across the board, we all say you failed. 
[01:18:30]  But yeah, give it a shot.  Yeah, let's say give it a shot.  You're a long shot right now.  Yeah.  I don't want to wreck the whole story.  So I guess if you really want to find out, you have to go to eatabullet.com.  Ah.  Oh, sir.  Exactly.  As much as I like a plug, the website's down right now.  We need real stories.  Goodbye, sir.  All right.  Well, that was not a real story.  Guys, I feel like I kind of brought that on to us in my apologies.  You did.  I've unleashed it out of me.  Picture your sister naked.  Oh.  Sam, Chuck Lydell. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  By the way, his manager emailed me yesterday and invited us to a match that Chuck is doing,  and Chuck is a fan of the show.  Yes.  Very cool.  It's good to know someone like him is on our side.  Well, Chuck and I have had our differences, and we settled it like men.  Him with his pants down and me performing a service.  You want guys like Chuck Lydell.  It has to be on your side.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Bob of the Love Sponge isn't. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, too bad.  Oh, Dice isn't.  Oh, too bad.  But Chuck Lydell, thank God, he's a fan of our show.  Go ahead, Sam.  Yeah, so he was on Good Morning Texas, and he didn't appear to be quite as lucid as he  was when he was on our show.  How did anyone see it?  If it was on Good Morning Texas.  It's become a viral video.  See, that's the beauty of the internet, man.  Yeah.  You get these little dopey tiny little shows, and something crazy happens.  Back in the day, no one saw it. 
[01:20:00]  Unless you had a big VHS copy that you start trading with your friends, but now it's on  the internet.  Everyone gets to enjoy it.  Yep.  That's why I love living during these times.  So we got the audio.  What's the deal?  Was he under the influence or something?  He appeared to be.  I mean, I don't want to.  He didn't publicly say that he was, but he appeared to be.  I mean, he was probably on some kind of painkillers from training or something.  Sure.  Dr. Sam is giving a diagnosis from a video clip.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, Dr. Sam. 
[01:20:30]  That I saw.  Let's get into this.  So the host tries to ask Chuck about the UFC, and this is what happened.  Say hello to Ultimate Fight Champion Chuck Liddell.  Nice to see you, Chuck.  Good to see you.  Welcome to Dallas.  You've been to Dallas so much before?  I've been to you quite a few times, yeah.  Okay.  I want to talk about Ultimate Fight Championships, because that's something that most of us will  never, ever experience in our lives.  None of us, most of us walking around the planet have the chops of what it takes to get  in the ring and do that.  How long have you been doing this, and how did you get started in this? 
[01:21:00]  I was 12.  Yeah?  I was in Crumfee Theater, and then that was in between the clips.  Right.  And I really got interested in the clips and started teaching our books about how it got  me in a crying glass.  I love Chuck Liddell.  Wow.  That could be the greatest clip I've ever heard.  Wow.  Now, we've had Chuck on the show, and he's a great guy.  He is completely with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Completely.  Like, sharp as a tack when he's on our show. 
[01:21:30]  Funny, articulate.  Absolutely.  And that right there is...  It's early in the morning.  He might have been up all night.  Dude, don't care.  Early in the morning.  Yeah, but man, someone like him, and you've got to think he's taking stuff to sleep,  because, you know, all the pains and aches he's got going on.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say Chuck was probably drunk.  Because the option...  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said that.  Because the other option is that his brain fell out.  I'm going to give Chuck the benefit of the doubt by saying he probably just didn't get 
[01:22:00]  to bed now.  I'm going with sleeping pill.  This is normal.  A lot of people do the sleeping pill.  And he had to get up really early, and the effects didn't wear off yet.  All right.  I'm going to just play it safe and say it was methamphetamines that he stole from an  underage girl he had had sex with.  All right.  All right.  That's Jimmy's opinion?  Just a guess.  Jim Norton's opinion?  Yeah.  I went with the safe answer.  I think it was from Too Many Carbs. 
[01:22:30]  I'm going to go with the host of Good Morning Texas.  Yes.  Yeah.  Is so god-awful and boring, he lulled him to sleep.  Did you hear that question?  Yeah.  And the delivery?  That's why that guy is in Texas somewhere doing Good Morning Texas.  Wow.  We showed Chuck talking.  Just showed Chuck.  Yeah.  Well, we got Chris from Texas.  Let's not forget it's Stepfather's Day, Jimmy.  It's Stepfather's Day.  We got the stingers and the promos and the sweepers running like crazy here this morning. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, boy.  This guy ain't going to be able to even do this.  Chris.  Yes, sir.  And you know what?  You guys got to help out the show.  We ask nicely every once in a while.  You know that little bit we just did with that fake collar and it led to a Jim Norton plug,  which we have no problem with?  But that bit today is done.  So if this story isn't real, please just hang up.  Okay.  I'm not going to hang up because this is not a deer pin house story.  All right.  And you're not going to be plugging in one of Jim Norton's dates because, seriously, 
[01:23:30]  a lot of people have some interesting stories.  We want to hear the real stuff.  All right.  Here we go.  Chris in Texas has a stepdaughter.  Go ahead, Chris.  She's exactly 10 years younger than I am.  How old are you?  I'm 40.  Oh.  Is it 19?  Wait a minute.  Your stepdaughter is nothing?  Is 30?  I didn't hear you, Jim.  I'm sorry.  I was too busy looking at your sister.  Oh, no.  I was, silly me, I was listening to the caller.  Oh, yeah.  What the hell am I doing?  Sometimes I forget we're actually doing a radio show.  He said she's 10 years younger.  How old are you, 40?  I said it would be funny if he was 19. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, no.  I've been with my wife for 20 years.  Oh, okay.  So this story is from the past.  Well, it is from the past, but we had a really great relationship.  I got the stepdaughter when she was 13.  Okay.  Yeah, because you scared me when you said, because I know what you're going to say here,  and if your stepdaughter is 30 and she's asking this question, my question would have  to be, she's a what?  Is she retarded?  Yeah, exactly.  All right, go ahead, Chris.  So this happened a while ago.  How old was she when she came to you with this?  Well, she was actually 18 when she came to me with this, but it began with, if you're 
[01:24:30]  going to drink, drink here.  If you're going to smoke pot, smoke pot here.  If you're going to party, party here.  I didn't want her out and about doing the things that teenagers do.  I was trying to be the really super cool dad.  Yeah, so she got around to the point of asking me one day, very, how, I'm trying to figure  out how to edit this for you.  Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part for us is watching you guys squirm trying to figure this 
[01:25:00]  out.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  She said, third base.  How would I know if I was doing that right?  Hmm.  Is that officially third base?  In my neighborhood, I think it was different.  I don't know.  First base is kissing.  Yeah.  Second base is up the shirt.  Third base.  Third base.  No.  Third base is don't handle my food. 
[01:25:30]  Dude, third base.  I think third base may have changed over the years.  That's what I'm thinking.  But third base in my day.  It was all of this.  Was, yeah.  All about the mitt.  Huh?  Bobby, remember when you said you spoke to a teacher recently and they said that certain  things weren't qualified as a black anymore?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  No, we, uh, I think, uh, Bill Clinton.  Yeah.  Monica Lewinsky.  All right.  So she asked you about that?  Yeah.  She said, how would I know if I was doing it right? 
[01:26:00]  And I said, well, you know, what kind of reaction are you getting?  And she said, um, could you show me?  And I didn't really realize what it was that she was asking.  And she clarified and she said, if I got, uh, a piece of fruit shaped.  Oh my God.  You're lying.  Okay.  Whatever.  You know, you don't have to believe it.  Well, no, that's, she wanted to know if you could watch her, uh, do this to a piece of  fruit and then critique her and say you're doing it right or wrong or critique and coach 
[01:26:30]  it.  And so what I did was I let her watch some, I had a better idea.  I picked a particular adult type of DVD and let her watch it.  Maybe.  I don't know.  How old was she when you did this though?  This is creepy.  Oh, she was 18 and you were 28.  Eh, maybe.  I mean.  Now, I will tell you this guys, there has been tensions between her and I for ever since  she became legal.  It's been there.  It's obvious. 
[01:27:00]  We both recognize it.  We just don't talk about it.  And, uh, you're 40 now.  She's 30.  Yeah.  It's tough.  It really is tough because I've watched her, you know, deal with some really bad guys in  her life and, you know, I.  And you know you could treat her better.  Yeah.  I say you dump the mother and you take her.  17 years you've been with the mother, right?  Yeah.  You gave it a shot.  No good.  You put in your time.  Enough.  Mom's 48 and the daughter's 30 and, guys, it's like watching, you know, the sands through 
[01:27:30]  the hourglass.  You got this version of her and this version of her.  Yeah.  Oh.  I say you dump the mother unceremoniously.  Like I say that she just comes home and finds all the furniture gone and a picture of you  and the daughter, like nude, waving at her from Topical Island.  And all that's left is a toothbrush and a camera.  Yeah, right.  If I weren't so head over heels in love, that would happen.  But I do want to ask you, is it wrong for me to fantasize while I'm self-manipulated?  No.  Well, we're, we're, we're, uh, this is what we're talking about today. 
[01:28:00]  We know this crap is going on.  Well, in my head, she's bisexual and she likes it back door.  Had a bad boy.  Jeez.  Wow.  Good girl.  I, uh, what, that didn't make it?  I wouldn't think it did, but.  Oh.  He's still been fantasizing inappropriately about her.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, he fantasized about her.  Look, you know what?  We got to give XM a little extra today anyway.  There you go, XM.  Uh, more Chuck Liddell, Lydell, whatever.  Uh, in this clip, he passes out in the middle of. 
[01:28:30]  Did he really?  Yeah.  In the middle of an answer.  Oh, no.  Yeah, so, but when, remember the first time you stepped in the ring to fight like this?  Because it's different than college wrestling.  Oh, yeah, it's a little different.  I think it's a little louder, a little, a little, a little stretching.  Okay, uh, the movie 300, you've seen it, and you're out to promote the film right now,  right?  You okay, Chuck?  Yeah, I'm okay.  All right.  You all right?  All right.  Doing all right.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  He actually did lull him to sleep.  He just dozed off. 
[01:29:00]  You could see his eyes fade that whole series of questioning, and so he asks him the question  and realizes that Chuck Liddell's sitting there with his, you know, with his head in his hand,  his eyes are shut, and he's like, you okay, Chuck?  Yeah, yeah.  He just got woken up.  By the way, the last caller is being called a liar because he said that he showed her  a DVD 12 years ago.  He might have.  12 years ago?  12 years ago.  12 years ago.  Or it might just be common speak, like, uh, like, uh, hey man, give me a, give me a,  I was watching this sexy tape. 
[01:29:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  It might just be the way you say something.  Actually, wait, 1995?  Yeah, DVDs were around.  Yeah.  DVDs.  All right.  Act like it was, uh, 1710.  Let's go to Nolan in Dallas.  We don't say hi to Dallas much for some reason.  What's up, Dallas?  Hey, uh, that, uh, Chuck Liddell video that was on Good Morning Texas?  Yeah.  He was actually, uh, hungover because he was out partying late, promoting 300 here in  Dallas and everything, and hit up a whole bunch of clubs and stuff like that.  And, uh, he also came on the, uh, Jagger show here in Dallas, too, and, uh, he was pretty 
[01:30:00]  hungover, and after he left the show, they were talking about how he was in the bathroom  throwing up a whole bunch of things.  Oh, man.  Oh, see?  I can relate.  Good for Chuck.  He kicks ass.  He's an animal.  That's the way he's supposed to behave.  Yeah, let him have a little fun.  All right.  Thank you, Nolan.  Uh, the host mentions that the Spartans wrestled nude for no apparent reason, then compared  them to the UFC.  He's calling him a homo.  I love the guys that gather some of these clips.  Their writing skills are terrific. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, these guys all fought like crazy.  They're real guys that really did exist.  I know they fought in the nude back then in the day.  I know in the movie, they don't do that, but they were kind of the ultimate fighting  machine, which is probably the connection with why you were on tour talking about this  movie.  Well, they had no fear of fighting.  They fought for what they believed in.  I think at all times, they thought they could win, but they were also willing to give up their  life to win what they thought they should win.  They were to win what they thought they should win. 
[01:31:00]  Wow, Chuck.  And you know, Chuck could still stand up and knock your teeth out.  Yeah, even in that state.  No kidding.  And then the final clip, the host sounds a bit concerned.  Now, when do you fight next, Chuck?  Probably in the bay.  That's what we're working on.  I would have loved it if he says in a half hour.  What time is it?  Or now, and then just punch him.  Yeah.  Now, when do you fight next, Chuck?  Probably in the bay.  That's what we're working on.  Do you know who you're going to fight?  Don't deal. 
[01:31:30]  Who do you want to fight?  Gordon White, I wouldn't mind fighting.  I wouldn't mind fighting Tyler Morrison.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, because he's back.  Wow.  I think there's quite a few of us out there.  I wouldn't mind getting Trump punches with.  Well, hang in there.  May the force be with you.  All right.  The movie 300 based on Frank Miller's graphic novel starring Gerard Butler from Phantom of  the Opera actually opens in Texas theaters on Friday, March the 9th.  And you hang in there today, okay? 
[01:32:00]  Take care of yourself.  Thank you very much, man.  All right, Chuck.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  May the force be with you.  He's a Jedi.  I didn't know.  I didn't know the host was a Jedi.  You see, now I get an excuse.  He's a little asleep.  I would love Chuck to be on the show like that.  To make him sound stupid.  Oh, we would love that.  Drunk Chuck.  He was sitting there breathing.  You hear him breathing because his nose, he's probably had his nose broken a bunch of  times.  Yeah.  Like a ball.  He's a real force, man.  All right, we got to step aside.  Jeez, that was really bad. 
[01:32:30]  Mackenzie.  Yes?  You're hot under the collar, right?  What?  What's the matter?  You're hot under the collar?  No, not at all.  We'll talk to you next.  Just stay there.  Can you hold?  We want to make sure you don't go anywhere.  We go to you next, okay?  Okay, thank you.  She doesn't, she's a little confused about Stepfather's Day.  I kind of agree with her.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live. 
[01:33:00]  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  And let's go right to the phones.  Phone number 1-866-313-3.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Mackenzie in Dub Bronx.  Mackenzie.  Yes?  First off, did you see J-Lo yesterday? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, me?  Yeah.  No.  She was all over the Bronx, I hear.  She went back to her, you know.  Hanging with her peeps.  Hanging with the peeps out there.  No?  I don't care.  You didn't see her?  No.  From the looks on the news, it was like everyone came out and she hung with everybody.  Not me.  Behind metal barriers.  Yeah, we'll get into the story.  It's a quickie.  But Mackenzie, what do you got for the show today?  I don't mind what you are doing, but it just bothers me.  You support To Catch a Predator, but isn't it kind of creepy that... 
[01:34:00]  Wait, we're supporting what?  To Catch a Predator.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And these stepfathers are kind of doing that.  Well, see, all we're saying today is that this is going on out there.  And I think it's going on with normal men.  I know it's creepy.  But do you think...  Yeah, it's just normal guys that are just men.  I have a calling and saying that they're looking at their stepdaughters. 
[01:34:30]  Wait a minute.  Do you have a stepdaughter?  Are you involved in that kind of...  Do you have a stepfather or do you marry a guy and you have a daughter?  Yes, and I thought it was creepy.  Oh, you do have a stepfather?  Yes.  Okay, so this is something that's hitting close to home for you.  So you're kind of coming off like a little self-righteous because it's just something that bothered you personally.  No, I felt uncomfortable and I moved out.  Your stepfather, he didn't touch you or come on to you because that's not really the stories we're looking for today.  We're looking for the normal human reaction.  Where it just goes on in a guy's head.  I understand that it is a normal human reaction, but that's what To Catch a Predator is about. 
[01:35:00]  Wait, no, no, no.  Now, see, this is where a lot of people are confused.  There are a lot more people thinking the same way as some of these creeps on Catch a Predator and a lot of guys out there thinking about their stepdaughters.  But here's the difference.  They don't act on it.  They're not acting on it.  I'm not saying they do act on it, but it's that they look and then they, just like on Catch a Predator, they go on the computer and then they just... 
[01:35:30]  Wait, sweetheart, how old were you when you moved out?  How old were you, like, when your stepfather was there and being creepy?  Fifteen.  Okay, and then what would he do?  Would he look at you when you came out of the bathroom?  What would happen?  Because you're not being specific.  I'm not going to say exactly what he did.  Well, why?  Hey, you're making a point.  We're trying to listen to you.  It was more than just doing that.  Oh, okay.  He...  I think that's why I'm just so creepy.  See, she had a bad experience.  All right, he what?  He what? 
[01:36:00]  Get it out.  It might help you.  Yeah.  It was more than just...  Talk to your pals.  It was more than looking.  Talk to your pals.  Touching.  When you were...  How long was he living with your mother or whatever before you started that stuff?  Not even a year.  Did you tell your mother?  Not even a year, and I...  Not even a year, and then what happened?  Like, what's...  I'm not good.  Why?  We don't know you.  I didn't do that.  What? 
[01:36:30]  I mean, did you tell on him?  No.  Oh, you just left the house.  I just moved out.  One and done, or after the tenth time, you said, you know what, maybe this is wrong.  Oh, don't be a jerk.  Well, was it...  Impossible.  It's a valid question, though.  It's a valid question of...  Did it go on for a while?  He's not a jerk.  I'm not a fetish jerk.  No, he's not.  I mean...  These are questions that need to be asked.  That's all.  And I...  How long did it happen for? 
[01:37:00]  Well, now I'm 25, so...  Well, how long were you there with him for?  Put him on the phone.  No, no.  She moved out.  She moved out last week.  So, you know, after 10 years, she's like, I'm done with this.  I was 15.  15.  All right.  10 years ago.  Okay.  And did you...  Is she still with him, your mother?  No, I moved out.  No, no.  Is your mother still with him?  Oh, no.  It's like interviewing with Dell.  All right.  It's Liddell, not Liddell.  I get it. 
[01:37:30]  Douches.  Huh?  I said you're such douches.  Yeah, no.  I mean, look, we're not talking about being creepy.  We're just saying normal guys.  Yes.  And you look...  Guys that have been calling up all day, they look at them and it's kind of creepy.  It is creepy.  But don't you know, this is what happens.  A normal guy is in a relationship with a woman who then has a daughter that looks like a woman.  She has a womanly figure and she's walking around scantily clad. 
[01:38:00]  There isn't one guy that isn't going to look at that and go, wow, that's hot.  But it doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to act on it.  And most of them are never going to act on it.  Right.  And if you've been listening closely, you can hear that in the guy's voices as they tell these stories today.  They're like, I know this is a bit creepy and I feel weird that I'm thinking this way, but I am because I'm human.  I understand that, but some of the guys that called today, they seemed like they were just... 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, okay.  I'll give her that.  Some of the guys that call have seemed a little more creepy than others.  Yeah, well, sure.  They seem like they're going to jump on it.  Right.  Do you hate your old stepfather?  Maybe.  So you obviously have a really hot story we want to get into.  So the deep...  Oh, what?  Right?  Don't be a douche.  Again, impossible.  Look, let's be honest.  Can I be honest with everyone today?  We've all been touched as a kid.  There you go.  Wow.  There you go.  Young Opie. 
[01:39:00]  Every single one of us.  A little tussling of the hair that went a little far.  I was.  Some of you, Junior.  I had a pedophile tell me that maybe I should investigate a gym membership.  I was like, but I want a cookie too, mister.  He's like, do some crunches with the talk.  Walking around trying to look hot and he's not paying attention to you.  The closest I came was when I was about, I guess...  28.  No, I was about 14 years old. 
[01:39:30]  And I was hanging out at the ranch, at the stable.  And there was a stable across the way.  And we were over there and there was a party going on.  And a bunch of Mexicans ran this stable.  And my father knew a bunch of the Mexicans and stuff.  So we used to hang out and drink beers and stuff.  Even though I was way underage.  And this drunk old Mexican guy comes up to me.  And I'm like hanging out with everybody else.  Kind of leaning against the car.  And he goes, hey, what do you say me and you go into the bushes over there? 
[01:40:00]  And how old were you again?  I was like 14.  Yeah, but see, those were the days of the tight shorts.  He knew.  Oh.  How can he...  He knew.  Yeah, he knew.  Right, Jerry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wasn't wearing tight shorts, sir.  He certainly was.  You would wear those.  Let me testify right now in front of you.  And under oath, I was not wearing tight shorts.  You wore the old Larry Bird NBA shorts.  No.  When you were growing up.  I was a cowpoke.  I was wearing jeans and boots.  No.  I've seen those shorts.  They were like...  It was like beige saran wrap. 
[01:40:30]  No.  Picture Will Ferrell in...  In that...  Ah, whatever.  He said...  It's a movie that's not out yet that I saw a picture of.  Yeah.  He plays a basketball player for like a basketball team.  Way, way over the top as far as trying to get a reference out there.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Anthony.  So he invites you into the bushes.  Yeah.  He said, why don't we go into the bushes?  And my father, who was standing very close, overheard that.  And grabbed the guy and threw him on the hood of a car and beat the crap out of him. 
[01:41:00]  Did he?  Yeah.  Did you call your dad a C-blocker until he was gone?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like, dad.  Jesus.  You always have to get in the way.  It wasn't like I would have had to do something to him.  Cut it out, Julie Jealous.  Pulling your father off.  No, the old Mexican would have wanted to kiss you.  I bet you he would have wanted to kiss you.  He would have chewed in his mouth.  Sexy.  It's dead.  Unwrap that burrito.  All pissed off because he realized he's getting a little too old. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not as attractive to the Mexicans anymore.  Here's some audio of my father.  Stay out the bushes.  There you go.  Stay out the bushes.  Yeah.  All right.  We lost her, by the way.  Hopefully she'll call back.  Kevin, Utah, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Good morning, little Jimmy.  I love you, bud.  Thank you.  Hey, give you a little catch up.  I'm only 28.  My wife is 48. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I've already heard all the jokes.  My wife has a daughter.  I like how he preempted us from making a joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've already heard the jokes.  Like what?  Like what jokes did you hear?  Like two Jews walking to a bar.  You married a cadaver.  Yeah, I think we have a few.  Hold on.  Maybe we have a few jokes you haven't heard of yet.  Exactly.  How many pollocks to change a light bulb, sir? 
[01:42:30]  I'll do his part.  Three.  No.  Two.  But one has to be 28 years older than her stupid husband.  Get it?  Or 20 years.  No, no.  He's 48.  She's 48.  He's 28.  Oh.  Right?  Yeah.  I did bad math.  All right.  I wrecked it.  Think of another one.  I don't like this.  Wait, now, sir.  How long have you been married to this octogenarian? 
[01:43:00]  I've been married with her for six years.  All right.  So you were 22 and she was 42?  Yes.  Where did you meet?  In the adult diapers section of the supermarket?  Hey, man.  They say 40 is the new 20, Jimmy.  Exactly.  Then 20 is the new 10.  Where did you meet this old bag?  Was she one of your teachers?  No, I'm teasing.  I don't mean disrespect.  Where did you guys meet?  We went to the same truck driving school.  Oh, wow. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  So a half a century year old trucker you're married to.  Trucker.  She started, oh, you know, she's been sitting for years, for miles going by.  Her ass looks like two plantains.  Boy, she must be a catch meeting her at trucker school.  Oh, my God.  She's a catch.  In a wedding photo, he's actually holding him with his right arm up.  She smells like that.  All right. 
[01:44:00]  What's up, Kevin?  She has a daughter.  I consider her my stepdaughter, even though she's one year older than I am.  Okay.  Wow.  And I have fantasied plenty of times about just seeing her, whatever.  You know what I'm trying to say, dadgum.  Yeah.  Fantasized it.  You know what, Kevin?  I agree with you because that's what I say to myself every day.  So I just wanted to point out there's someone out there like me that gets a few words wrong.  Who cares?  We understand.  Right. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  We know what you're saying.  All right.  Go ahead, Kevin.  I like that.  I just tried to see, imagine of what she looked like.  Just wanted to walk into the shower, but I'm scared to see what her, I don't want her mom  slipping out on men.  But last year, her daughter, her husband is 13 or 14 years older than her daughter, and  he has a 17-year-old daughter.  She moved in with us.  We live all on the same property. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, my God.  She's in a WB show.  Oh, my God.  I literally, when she comes home, I look, I just shake my head, and I say, well, hon,  love you, got to go.  I get back in my truck, and I leave.  BJ and the barely living.  I was going to go with barely legal, because of the grave.  Wow.  He's going with his old wife.  That's brilliant.  Smokey in the old bag just. 
[01:45:30]  Hold on, my little love.  You're 22.  You're 20.  You're 28.  Your wife's 48.  Stepdaughter's 29.  Her husband is 42, and his daughter is 17.  What?  Correct?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She'll be 18 in September.  And you get these thoughts, but you're not acting on it.  That's what we're getting at today.  But it drives you a little crazy, right there?  Right, Kevin? 
[01:46:00]  It is.  Absolutely.  I would never touch her, just because, you know, I consider him, like I said, my stepdaughter,  my step-granddaughter.  But it drives me nuts to see him.  See?  Thank you, Kevin.  See?  He's just a guy.  Yeah.  Looking.  Oh, boy.  Enough with the frunkers.  Let's go to Tom in New York City.  Tom, what's up?  What's up, boys?  How we doing?  Good.  I just want to thank you guys for your refreshing honesty with this topic.  And the reason that people get creeped out is because we have a Pollyanna view that we're 
[01:46:30]  all perfect, but the truth is, we all have these thoughts.  And Ant, you hit the nail on the head.  Ooh.  You said the difference is when a normal person thinks about it, the predator acts on it.  Yeah.  Or I said it.  I've said it before.  Or I'll be said it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, I don't really get much credit on this show, so I feel like I should have just grabbed  that one.  Yeah, you'd take it.  It's yours.  Back, boy.  Because Ant can't do no wrong on this show.  It gets frustrating to all of us.  What happened? 
[01:47:00]  I missed.  I was watching Trump slap Vince McMahon in the face.  Yeah, that's terrific.  WrestleMania right around the corner.  Is he going to wrestle?  Is the Donald wrestling?  The Donald.  And I'm hearing things that WWE wants to get involved with the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy  Tour.  Oh.  That can be kind of exciting, depending on what they want to do.  And at the end of every comic set, instead of the little light that comes on, we hit them  on the back of the head with a chair.  That would be cool.  That would be fun.  They want to be involved?  Yeah, they really want to be involved.  The Comedy Tour is becoming the hot thing this coming summer. 
[01:47:30]  Good.  April 14th, first date, Vegas.  Yes.  At the joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  So, we got like, what, nine comedians.  It's a great lineup.  All the info is on our website, opiananthety.com.  Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster.  And then when we're out in Vegas, we're going to give the lineup.  We're going to do a little press conference out there.  Channel 5, Women Too Nervous to Get Naked, audio.  Yeah, get that.  Absolutely.  It should just be called Fatsos.  Oh, Fatsos. 
[01:48:00]  Too Nervous to Get Naked.  And I got to talk to Chicago right now.  Hi, Chicago.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing things.  What are you hearing, sweetie?  I'm hearing that the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour will not be making a stop in Chicago.  We got to get to the bottom of that.  What?  Bottom.  That's all I'm hearing right now.  I got to get more details, but that's not cool.  Start a petition drive.  Will you do something, Chicago?  Start contacting WCKG.  Let's see if there's some interest up there.  Who said that?  I'm just hearing things.  Guys up. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  We'll take a break in a second, but there was a really good one.  Oh, you guys want to get really creepy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Jared in Texas.  See, we could have taken these calls all morning.  Jared, what's up?  What's up, boys?  I've been up all night.  I've been waiting to call in this morning.  I heard the promos.  So, here's my story.  Is it true?  Huh?  True story.  True story.  Okay.  Swear to God.  I was going out with the girlfriend.  She was 15. 
[01:49:00]  I was 17.  You know, a little bit creepy anyway.  But she told me a story about when her grandpa made her get naked in the garage.  And I'm talking fully naked.  And he sat back in a chair and made her dance around.  This is completely off topic.  No, it's not.  This isn't.  What song?  Was it a step-grandfather?  It all depends on the song.  Was it a good song?  Yeah.  If it was some R&B crap, then, you know, the guy's a creep. 
[01:49:30]  This is like incestuous abuse.  This has nothing to do with our topic of the day.  You have to call on incestuous abuse day.  Well, we're going to wait.  That's usually Monday through Tuesday through Wednesday.  Oh, God.  Actually, tomorrow we're going to...  Oh, my God.  That is fun to watch.  I'm just watching you stumble.  My little bird lips couldn't move.  I don't know.  I salvaged that.  You couldn't figure out a day.  Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday.  You should blow up in a car. 
[01:50:00]  Apollonia.  Why not?  I have bosoms like she did.  Picture your sister naked.  Ant?  Dude.  What?  It was creepy.  Oh, my God.  I creeped out when I heard that story.  Now, did she have to dance sexy, or did she dance like Cab Calloway in the Blues Brothers?  He made her do Minnie the Moocher naked.  I pulled the same gimmick like her grandpa did,  but we were going out at the time, so...  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's abuse.  There's a kid that keeps calling and hanging up.  He wants to talk about how hot his stepmom is.  Let's hear it.  That's a different thing.  Yeah.  But it's kind of tied in.  And someone wants us to have girls call in about stepsons.  Maybe tomorrow, if the girls are brave enough to, you know, give us a call.  That's a whole different dynamic.  I think so.  The sons could call in about the moms.  Yes.  That's one thing.  I remember once I found pictures of my stepmom. 
[01:51:00]  She wasn't my stepmom, but my father and her were together for so many years.  They might as well have been, you know?  And I think the first time I met her, I was probably 12 years old,  drove out to California, and then lived out in California with them,  and they were together, you know, until my father died.  But I went through their drawers once and found Polaroid pictures of her naked.  Was she hot?  It was really disturbing.  When she was younger, it was pictures of when she was younger.  So, you know, they were like really cheesy black and white Polaroids. 
[01:51:30]  So, it was kind of like dirty.  I looked through them, though.  Did you?  Did you?  No, I didn't scrap.  Did you?  I didn't scrap.  No, no, that was too weird.  And I had plenty of like smut around, so it wasn't like I needed that.  But I was just snooping and found them.  I was like, oh, jeez.  Oh.  We'll wake up the snoopers tomorrow, too.  And the incest survivors tomorrow.  Did you find anything shaped like the Seattle space needle in there? 
[01:52:00]  You had to pick it up and smell it.  Let's say hi to Mackenzie again.  Mackenzie.  Yes.  All right.  You're feeling a little more comfortable.  So, what happened?  You're 15.  I don't know.  You told me because I got cut off.  You said call back again.  Well, we felt bad how we left it.  And I think your story could maybe help others out there.  You were 15.  And I guess there was more than a weird look going on, right?  Yes.  Could you walk us through it a little bit and keep it clean for the radio? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  All right.  It wasn't good.  I'll just tell you that.  Okay.  Well, give us a little bit.  You don't have to get graphic, but at least a little bit.  Yeah.  Figured it wasn't good.  You got to understand that we do get serious sometimes on this show.  Just as guys are calling your show today and saying, oh, yeah, they look so hot, blah,  blah, blah.  And then, like, oh, I want to get with them and blah, blah, blah.  If any girl feels like that and they feel like their stepfather is looking at them like 
[01:53:00]  that, it will go to the next level.  And what was the next level with you, Mackenzie?  What?  What was the next level with you?  I don't want to talk about that.  How long did it take to get to the next level?  Yeah.  Don't be.  No, I'm asking really.  Were you sleeping?  No.  Huh? 
[01:53:30]  No.  Was he a drinker?  Yes.  Okay.  So he was drunk one night?  Yes.  And your mother was home in another room or she was working?  I'm not home.  She wasn't home.  And did he come into your room or was it when you came home from being out or whatever?  Oh, Jimmy Dorton.  No, I'm asking really.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Get you to talk about it.  Why not?  I don't know.  You're very good at it.  You're very good to get it out of people.  No, because Jimmy has, you know, told some horrific things from his past, so he understands 
[01:54:00]  in a way.  You're very good at getting things out.  Yeah, absolutely is.  So what happened?  He's drunk?  And he...  I don't like saying it.  All right, wait a minute.  He had kind of looked at you.  You got creeped out by it.  He's not looking.  No, no, no.  I mean, but I'm sure at first it started with just creepy looks, right?  Yes.  Okay, so then your mother's out, and you're...  It's late at night.  He's been drinking.  Were you asleep, or did you just come home? 
[01:54:30]  At least, what was happening there?  I was...  Oh, my God.  You just made me say it.  All right.  I was there, and he just came just straight out with it.  He said something to you, or he did something?  No, just tried to kiss, and then he grabbed my ass.  Oh, he tried to kiss you?  He tried to kiss you.  Where were you?  Were you on the sofa?  Were you in the kitchen, or were you...  On the toilet.  I was on the toilet.  You're an idiot.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  I know.  All right.  So he tried to kiss you, and what did you do?  I kicked him, and then I had left, and I never went back.  Hmm.  Mackenzie.  I know.  You's a...  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm asking you for real.  I think that you're leaving something out.  No way, as awful as that would be, and creepy.  I don't believe that only...  No, the look started as creepy, and then it went further and further. 
[01:55:30]  Wait.  One time he tried to...  You said the first time he tried to do physical was he just tried to kiss you, and then he  grabbed your ass.  No, it was the looks of the way he started was the looks of creepy, and then it started progressing  from there.  And it went from the kissing and the trying to grab your ass to what?  No, because he was a drunk guy.  He just went from looking to just trying to grab. 
[01:56:00]  Okay, how long did he try to grab for?  That obviously wasn't once.  How long did that happen for?  It wasn't that long.  Okay.  Did you ever do anything sexual with him?  No.  That's kind of a hesitation there.  What I moved out is immediately when he tried anything with me, and my mother didn't believe  me.  Please don't kill the messenger, but Douche Nozzle from Whackbag, he writes this morning  on Instant Feedback, could this little slut speed it up and get to the good stuff?  Oh, God.  You people are the worst. 
[01:56:30]  That's Douche Nozzle.  That's not us.  Yeah.  Douche Nozzle has always been his own entity.  And Douche Nozzle.  That's right.  We don't know him.  That's a very appropriate name.  Right.  See, he's a douche, and he's nozzling.  And quite a nozzle.  He's just a nozzle.  It's not even a bag.  He hasn't even worked his way up to the bag yet.  I would love if people who said that had something like this happen to them.  Yeah.  I can certainly understand that.  I mean, because I've dated...  I don't mind.  Like, seriously, I find...  It's all about you.  Go ahead.  I find...  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  I find...  Go ahead.  Continue. 
[01:57:00]  Like, you know my pain.  Go ahead.  I'm trying to explain something.  You jump right in.  Go ahead.  I find their stories funny.  I've been where you are.  I'm talking about their daughters, but...  Yeah, no, no.  Wait.  Listen.  You see, you're being very rude and crass and interrupting.  I think I've been kind of where you are.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  You talk.  I mean, there's no reason for me to contribute.  It's all about you, apparently.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Me, me, me, me, me.  Well, it was me.  I know.  It's so funny.  But some of the stories are kind of creepy, and...  Well, how do you think I felt, huh, in that situation? 
[01:57:30]  How do you think I felt that stepdaughter running around the house and my girlfriend at  the time getting fat?  What's a man supposed to do?  Give me those ribs, you.  Don't be a dick.  How many years ago did this happen?  You're an idiot.  How many years ago?  What?  I'm 25.  It was 10 years.  Oh, God.  Get over it by now.  What?  Enough.  What?  Are you...  He said, are you over it?  He said, are you over it by now?  You tell me I should be over it.  No, no.  He asked, are you over it? 
[01:58:00]  I asked.  Build you out.  Are you over it?  I should be over it by now?  Well, it's been 10 years.  And he only tried to kiss you.  It's not like he did anything awful.  Like, that's bad.  But, I mean, maybe...  I wish.  You should suffer.  We heard your story, and we're experts.  We're experts.  You said you were in prison, and then guys are just trying to fuck you in the ass.  Oh, God.  Oh, hey.  Now you're talking to me.  Now you're talking to me, love.  Hey, certainly.  It's like, what is... 
[01:58:30]  Hey.  You're a potty mouth.  That's like, what?  We heard your story.  You should have been, I don't know, affected for like two years.  I know.  No one would sit in a tub after that crying.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not like you need a rape shower or anything.  You're making it like it's something stupid, I'm saying.  No.  No, no.  It's not stupid.  Did you know what it was like?  What?  If guys could know what it was like, that's what it would be like.  We do know what it's like.  No, you don't.  Okay.  All right, Mackenzie.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  You know what it's like to be hit on and try to do good. 
[01:59:00]  Yes.  Have you seen me?  Who doesn't want to touch me in some way, shape, or form?  I'm mushy.  You should be flattered.  It's obvious you're not a fatso.  I don't know what it's like to be wanted, touched.  All right, Mackenzie.  We really got to do our show.  Yeah, we got to get back to the show.  Are you a pretty girl?  I didn't see your name on the door when we came in here.  Yeah, it's not Mackenzie in the morning.  Right.  It's still Opie and Anthony with old Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  It's not the Mackenzie and Silly Goose Stepfather show. 
[01:59:30]  I don't see Mackenzie in the morning billboards all over the subways, all right?  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I found a lot of the stories when the guys were calling  were funny.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, shut up.  What time did you start drinking this morning?  You sound like you were tipping a few back, Chuck.  Mackenzie?  All right, Mackenzie.  Thanks for sharing.  Take care of yourself.  Yeah.  Take care.  You all right?  You all right?  Take care.  Well, no, she's got to listen to her. 
[02:00:00]  Take care of yourself.  All right, she's gone.  All right, it's...  May the force be with you.  It's the Mackenzie show.  We got an update on the dude that's got to pay his ex-wife that became a dude.  Did the judge make a decision?  Because that's what he was suing for.  We got the update.  We're going to do it next week.  Oh, an update.  I love updates.  We love updates on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program. 
[02:00:30]  There you go.  Did I do good?  You did real good, Jimmy.  Real good.  I really bring this show back strong when I do that.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony program.  It is Opie and Anthony.  It's a virus.  You do that very well, by the way.  The O-N-A virus.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's not easy to do.  I can't.  You bring it back with an energy. 
[02:01:00]  I've tried it a couple of times and I flop miserably.  That's great.  I'm just like, welcome back.  That's like watching American Idol and they go, well, at least you look good.  No.  I mean, this is easy.  No, it's not.  This is the easy part.  No, it's one of those things that looks easy until you try it.  And then you're like, oh, yeah, that is kind of good.  That actually pisses me off when I watch American Idol.  They're singing their heads off there.  They're trying to be the next American Idol.  Well, and the best the judges could do is go, well, you look great up there.  You're such a beautiful girl. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  They don't want to hear that crap.  Haven't heard that your whole life.  Right.  The looks are not part of the performance.  Bringing back your show is a part of the show.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  Monkey could do this.  I know.  I'm not stupid.  Well, on certain stations.  Yeah, well, see.  And there's your strength.  I applaud you today, little Jimmy Norton.  All right.  Hey, in case you missed it, we had this story yesterday.  A Clearwater man is fighting to stop his alimony payments because his ex-wife is now a man. 
[02:02:00]  Lawrence Roach asked a Clearwater judge to end the monthly payments of $1,250.  He divorced his wife, Julia, in 2004 after 18 years of marriage.  But since that time, Julia had a sex change and is now Julio.  Attorneys for the ex-wife say that the operation doesn't change the couple's alimony agreement.  Roach agreed to make the payments until his ex-wife dies or remarries, according to his attorney.  The judge is still considering the argument. 
[02:02:30]  That was, I believe, yesterday.  Would this drive you nuts, Anthony?  Oh, my God.  Can you just imagine?  Any of these stories.  You thought your situation was bad, and it is bad, Anthony.  We all know that.  Could you imagine this?  No.  Would you just lose your mind?  Imagine that.  You've got to send a check to a guy, a transsexual guy.  Gender.  Guy.  Post-op thing.  Because you know, every time a woman becomes a man, I don't even know what that operation's all about. 
[02:03:00]  They take skin and muscle tissue from somewhere and try to build something that resembles male anatomy.  And then they give them the hormones, their breasts go away, their hips go away, and they always grow facial hair.  Every time you see a transsexual that went from a female to a male, they'll always have the big beard.  Because that's how they have to show that they're now a man. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And you're just writing a check to some dude that you were married to.  You would hang yourself.  How embarrassing.  First of all, it's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing to you, your entire family, your friends.  Oh, jeez.  Don't say anything.  There's my ex at the table over there.  What?  Yeah, Grizzly Adams.  That's right.  Over there at the table.  Spending my money.  Look at that.  Oh, would that be embarrassing?  Well, guess what? 
[02:04:00]  We have an update.  Ex still do alimony when she becomes he.  Oh, no.  A woman's sex change operation does not free her ex-husband from his alimony obligation, a judge said Wednesday.  Judge stupid.  Attorneys for Lawrence Roach, 48, had argued his 55-year-old ex-wife's decision to switch genders and change her name from Julia to Julio voided their 2004 divorce agreement.  Circuit judge blah, blah, blah, however, ruled that in the eyes of the law, nothing changed significantly enough. 
[02:04:30]  Nothing changed significantly enough to free Roach from his $1,250-a-month obligation.  The judge said since Florida courts have ruled sex change surgery cannot legally change a person's birth gender, Roach technically is not paying alimony to a man.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And where did the money come from for this sex change? 
[02:05:00]  He probably had to pay for it.  He probably bought and paid for that wiener.  You know how you had to pay for, like, the ex's house there?  Yeah.  Just imagine he had to pay for, like, a sex change.  See, it could always be worse, Ant.  Mm.  And people say that to try to make you feel better.  Believe me.  It could always be worse.  Believe me, I'm looking, it says Roach pays $1,250-a-month.  Yeah.  I wouldn't care if she stapled one on her forehead.  If that's all you had to pay? 
[02:05:30]  If that's what I had to pay, I wouldn't care if she got three of them and put them all over her body.  If she got a hula skirt made out of schlongs, I wouldn't care.  For $1,250-a-month?  Yeah.  She got off easy.  His last name's Roach.  Yeah, this is...  Talk Roach, how appropriate.  Let's go to Mike.  He's got an obvious question here.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, doesn't the fact that the wife got the sex change operation mean that she was the reason for the divorce because she wasn't into the husband? 
[02:06:00]  Who knows?  You would think that that would kind of null and void the marriage in general.  It doesn't matter what the reason they got divorced is.  That's too bad.  The reason could be, yeah, she can't stand him.  She's into women.  She wants to become a man.  It doesn't matter.  Still helpless.  Helpless poor woman that can't afford anything and can't get a job and has to be supported by a man. 
[02:06:30]  That's how the courts think.  Well, she's not a helpless woman anymore.  Yeah.  She's all a man.  That's right.  She's Chuck Connors.  Right.  Hey, we got a little laugh from Sue on Long Island.  Sue, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Sue.  Hi, Sue.  I just wanted to talk about the caller, Mackenzie, that you had mentioned earlier in the show  that girls are too shy to call up and talk to you about certain things.  And so you get this girl on the line and she's all sensitive and vulnerable and then you tear her apart. 
[02:07:00]  I know.  I told him that, too, in the break.  Yeah, I got a scolding, too.  I just think it's a little ironic.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I love it.  I think it's great.  I was laughing my ass off on my way to school.  But, Sue, how many times did you look at your radio and just say to yourself, oh, just get over it already?  Oh, all the time.  But, Sue, what you're saying is that we always complain that women won't open up.  Why?  Did you have a story like hers?  Oh, no, not at all. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  I was just...  We're hoping to get you to open up so we can humiliate you, too.  Yeah.  Well, Sue, this is what I do today.  Watch this.  You like Bob Saget?  Yeah, Bob Saget's cool.  Cool.  Have you ever seen him do stand-up?  No, I haven't.  You have no idea what you're in for because we're going to give you a pair of tickets to see Bob Saget, our pal, our buddy.  He's a filthy mouth when he's doing his stand-up, you know.  Where is he going to be?  Well, Anthony's going to be at the North Fork Theater in Westbury.  That's the old Westbury Music Fair.  That's right, Anthony. 
[02:08:00]  And Bob Saget will be there on April 20th.  Doors open at 630.  Like, that matters to anybody out there, but it's on the sheet.  Show starts at 8.  Sue, would you accept this pair of tickets from me, Opie, from the Opie and Anthony Show?  Hey.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony's giving them out, too.  Yeah.  That sounds great.  We're all giving them to her.  Ah, Jimmy doesn't give them to her.  No, I don't.  I love the fact that we don't give them to the girl who was abused and almost crying on the phone.  We give them to the chick who gave us a titter when she called in.  Points out that we were scum to her. 
[02:08:30]  We want to be unpredictable.  What can I tell you?  How about human?  Can we be human?  That'll take a little more work.  We're trying, Jimmy.  We show it every once in a while.  Sue, all right?  Hold on the line.  You get the tickets?  All right, great.  How's your day going?  Everything all right?  Pretty good.  Yeah?  All right.  Hang in there.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  May the force be with you.  Give Sue the tickets.  I'm just going to give the good morning Texas answer to everybody today.  Yeah.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  You all right? 
[02:09:00]  Frank in Stanford.  Frank?  Hey, O&A.  Yeah?  Listen, about that sex change operation.  Didn't the judge say that the only way that they can get out is through death or if they  get married?  Now the guy's really screwed because I don't think she could ever get married now, can't  she?  Now, if the law says that you can't change the gender, she could get married to a man,  but that is probably what she's not looking for.  If she's changed to a guy, then she probably wants a woman, so she couldn't get married 
[02:09:30]  to a woman because technically she's still a woman, so it takes the marriage angle out  of the mix for him to get off the alimony payment.  Let's look at the positive side of this story, by the way.  You can now go toe-to-toe with your ex-wife.  Oh, yeah.  Fight.  And you're not going to get in trouble for her.  You know you could beat her up, too.  Because you're beating up another dude.  But it is taking a bit of a gamble.  Why?  If you get your ass handed to you.  Hopefully, she's passive-aggressive, though, and got a hog put on that was bigger than  his. 
[02:10:00]  You know that's probably what happened.  Of course.  You know, just make sure it's like an eighth of an inch bigger.  By a nose.  By a nose, right.  And you can go for the groin kick during the fight.  Yeah.  Now.  I don't know what they used down there.  No, it's nothing.  Two fuzzy dice from Puerto Ricans mirror.  Frank from Stanford.  Anything else there?  And I guess that was about it.  But let me tell you.  I almost rolled off the street when I heard that Ant was going to make his wife have a 
[02:10:30]  hula hoop skirt.  I wouldn't care.  For $1,200 a month.  Quit, man.  $1,250 a month.  Nice.  It comes down to money in the end.  You guys are the best, man.  Yeah, we know.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  Yeah, I just got a quick question about the line you guys are drawing between a stepfather  that would act upon it and one that wouldn't.  That would what?  Oh.  So, in other words, like that show with the pedophiles.  You know, the guy goes to the house. 
[02:11:00]  If he didn't have anything on the website about, I want to have sex with an underage  girl, he just showed up there.  Could they have arrested that guy?  Here's the difference, dude.  A guy had, I think we all know the difference between a guy who is actively seeking out a  youngster for sex and being a predator with a stranger and somebody who's just in a situation  where as a human being, you look at a woman who like, yeah, it's not right because she's  16, but like human emotion takes over and you look a little more inappropriate than  you should.  I mean, I think that we all know there's a common sense line of what is disgusting and 
[02:11:30]  predatorial and what is just kind of a human reaction for a guy to have in that situation.  It's as simple as walking down the sidewalk.  You see an attractive girl and you crane your neck.  You turn around.  You look at her and then you continue walking or you go to your friend.  You go, wow, how about that?  And you don't just run after her and stick your hands up her skirt and start, you know,  throwing it down on the sidewalk.  There's a difference between just appreciating the beauty in something and, you know, attacking 
[02:12:00]  it.  And your question about if you didn't type in stuff on the Internet and went over to the  girl's house, I think if you didn't show intent, you're actually okay.  But then they wouldn't.  Your computer's got pictures of a 16-year-old stepdaughter naked on your computer.  What is that?  That's a crime.  That's different.  That's a crime.  Dude, you can talk in many circles as you want.  We're explaining what the difference is, though.  And you're saying that your common sense doesn't dictate the difference between a predator 
[02:12:30]  and a pedophile and a guy who just looks at a 16-year-old daughter.  You see no difference in those things?  You can honestly say that?  Yes, I can see the difference.  Okay, then what's your point?  Yeah.  That's my point.  You said it's okay to look and think, but it's not okay to touch.  And if you look and think in a picture...  I'm not even sure that we actually came out and said it's okay to look and think.  I did.  We're just basically saying this is what happens with humans.  I think we all, the majority of the people listening to us right now, have some pretty 
[02:13:00]  crazy thoughts in their heads on a daily basis.  And you think to yourself, God, thank God people can't read my mind.  Yeah.  Because I'm thinking some crazy stuff here.  But I'm not acting on it.  And I go about my life and I never act on these thoughts.  Dude, it's okay at times to think about pulling somebody off the road for driving badly  and punching him in the face.  It's a big difference if you do it.  Yeah.  What if you make a picture of it?  You have a picture of an underage girl.  That's illegal, dude.  That's a crime.  That's a crime.  That is the difference there.  And with that, Rob, we got to go.  I mean, if you want to continue, you know, we're here tomorrow. 
[02:13:30]  You know that.  Thank you.  All right.  The guy's talking about like, oh, you ever imagine robbing a bank and then actually  going in and robbing a bank?  It's different.  But what if you have a joint?  The picture of the girl makes it illegal.  Right.  So the thinking is not illegal.  Yet.  Yeah, but it's your own daughter.  It's creepy.  It is foolish.  And again, people know the difference when we're talking about.  You raise it from a child.  You're a creep.  Mike Jersey, we end with you.  What's up?  Oh, shoot.  Mike, what's up?  Mike?  What's up?  What's up?  Hey, I work for a mobile company. 
[02:14:00]  I'm out on the road all day long driving around.  You guys make it so hard for me to get out of my van and go talk to potential customers.  I don't want to get out of the van.  Thank you.  We're doing our job, Ope.  Thank you, Mike.  You ever help a girl load a couch into that van?  We're good.  We're good.  Thanks, Mike.  We got to go.  Mom's broken.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  If not, uh...  Beat her with a cast.  Ah, screw you.  Ah, yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:30]  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  We'll see you guys over at XM.  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  I have headphones.  They're basically saying you're not that important.  I'm not.  Oh, well.  It happens.  Oh, there they are.  I'm going to say Anthony only.  Thank you.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve.  Steve gets a gold star today.  Yeah.  And someone gets a demerit.  Yeah.  I don't know who. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know who because...  How do we do demerit?  Who's supposed to have my headphones ready for me?  Is it Danny?  Danny's not even here today?  No, Danny.  Okay.  Then blame Danny.  There you go.  Ah, now that sounds better.  It's more like me.  Let's...  If I don't have headphones on, then I'm just talking.  It's like real life.  How do I answer phone calls without a mouse?  Now I'm on the radio.  Oh, now I'm not important.  Uh-oh.  Everyone's important.  There we go.  Why does Ann have my mouse?  Because Ron uses my seat and he uses... 
[02:19:00]  He goes to the phones with that mouse.  So I get this mouse.  I see what's going on.  Ron and Fez, much more important than Opie and Anthony.  No.  Ron and Fez, much more important than Opie and Anthony.  Is that what you said?  Diana from California.  What's up?  What does that mean?  Me again.  I called earlier.  I just wanted to tell that stupid bitch that you gave the tickets to that not everyone,  but not every girl that calls in there gets made a fool of.  Hey, what was your story?  Because I forgot all about you as soon as you hung up. 
[02:19:30]  My old...  My...  Well, my old best friend, Christy, she used to, like...  Basically, her and her friend Emily used to hump her stepdad.  Like...  Oh, yeah.  We could do a much...  All right.  Hold on.  We could do a much better job with your story over here at XM.  What's it on the radio?  In the pool?  In the pool.  The dude is minding his own business.  He's up against the side of the pool.  Well, yeah.  They're all, like, out in the pool playing, you know?  Like...  And was there dry humping going on?  In the pool, I guess.  And they would get on him, like you do when you go... 
[02:20:00]  When you're in the pool with your boyfriend, they would...  And they thought it was funny, because that...  It was...  It was just a spiteful thing that she did because of her mom.  Are you dunking...  Just feel his rod.  Are you dunking children as you speak to us?  No, I'm in the...  I'm in the...  Well, I'm in the tub.  I'm shaving my legs.  You're in the bathtub right now?  Mm-hmm.  Do you have a toaster?  Do I have a toaster?  I'm serious.  Maybe she could drop it in there.  I do have one, but it's not in my bathroom.  The show's becoming, you know...  You've seen in movies and stuff where the housewives, they have their phone on their shoulder 
[02:20:30]  and they just go about their business just yip, yip, yip, yip, yip with each other.  Women are feeling comfortable with us enough to include them in their little chatter session.  I kind of like that.  She's in the tub.  I feel like my boyfriend laughs at me because I feel like you guys are, like, really my friends.  It's like...  We are.  We certainly are.  Everyone that's listening out there, we're talking just to you and your friend.  You want to be friends with benefits?  Hey, is he home right now? 
[02:21:00]  I think I might be coming to you guys, is the thing in L.A., the traveling virus.  In Vegas.  Or in Vegas, I mean.  Vegas.  I got to tell you, you sound really hot, but that's probably a stretch?  It's probably what?  Are you hot?  Am I hot?  If she's shaving her legs, she's got to be hot.  I'm not fat.  Why would a fat girl shave her legs when they cover them up with everything all the time?  Those sweatpants.  All right.  Big Rosie O'Donnell pants.  But I love you guys, and if they had anything pertinent to say, then they wouldn't be made fun of. 
[02:21:30]  Even Opie, you're nice to me, and that, it makes me very happy.  I'm nothing.  Remember when I called when I wanted you guys to play the My Baby is Black thing?  Oh, that was you.  My Baby is Black.  And you did play it for me the next morning, so.  And there aren't any ugly girls in California.  Right.  I'm not from California.  There are plenty of ugly girls out here.  They just all look alike, and they're all black.  Who cares?  Are you naked right now?  That's all anyone wants to know. 
[02:22:00]  Better be.  Do you shave your legs with clothes on?  In the tub.  Oh, well, look.  She showed me.  All right.  Let's get into this a little bit.  A little bit.  I know the boyfriend.  He doesn't listen when he goes to work, right?  Hey, have you been watching the Andrew Dice Clay thing?  Yeah.  Honestly, yeah, I have.  He's supposed to be going on Howard Stern's show on the next one.  Yeah, that's the next one.  Him and Howard are supposed to be battling it out.  I think it's hilarious.  Battling it out.  How phony is that?  If he wants to fight, it's been 10 years. 
[02:22:30]  He looks all ragged in the morning.  Just when you think the show couldn't get any more boring.  I wish I could find this article that Dice did and all the horrific things he said about Howard  and why he was putting his foot down and he would never go on Howard's show again.  I got to find the article.  I think it was in Steppin' Out magazine.  Did he do his voice lessons?  That was hilarious.  Honestly, you know a little more about it than I do.  And doesn't that black guy that he had to do the recording or whatever, doesn't he look 
[02:23:00]  like Earl, like Earl will look in like 10 years?  Well.  That's Earl in 10 years.  Oh, the black guy that was recording a CD?  I got to be honest.  I took a peek at Dice's show on VH1 hoping it was going to be bad and I was...  It's funny.  I don't...  It's hilarious.  His kids are faggy.  There's no buzz on his show though.  It's one and done.  No way.  You don't never even know when the new ones are coming on.  It's one and done. 
[02:23:30]  Because all the people he stabbed in the back would have made for some really good TV alongside  him.  Yeah.  That is a fact.  Like the people that are left are the ones that...  There's nothing really to them.  You know, I mean Club Soda Kennedy would have gave him great TV.  Imagine that.  Imagine the videos of him walking out on stage at the virus tours or something like that.  It could have been huge, but...  He blew it.  Yeah, he blew it.  And you got to just...  You got to watch it.  Because it's fucking hilarious that he was as big as he is and he's riding around with 
[02:24:00]  old lady glasses on and...  He's got the old lady glasses like it's...  Like he just had a big cataract.  Like a Jew lady glasses.  Yeah, exactly.  Like Jewish ladies wear big, huge glasses.  The cataract glasses.  Diana?  New bit.  We are going to make you part of the show.  We want you, when it's time to shave your legs, to just call the show and do some of this  just chatter with us.  I like the echo from the bathroom, the water that you hear.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, this is the type of thing women do when the men aren't around.  They pick up the phone. 
[02:24:30]  They're smoking and just hanging out.  And just shooting the shit.  Yeah.  Just chewing the fat.  Nothing really important going on, but just interesting enough to kind of keep it going.  What are you using?  One of them lady bicks?  Actually, I'm using one of the new Gillette Fusion.  Oh, Gillette Fusion.  What kind of cream you got on your legs?  I just use soap.  Just soap?  You got to cream them up with something.  If I use cream, it irritates my legs. 
[02:25:00]  Does it?  It irritates your legs, huh?  Yeah, it makes my skin achy.  Now, Diana, if you're going to be part of the show, we've got to know about you.  So, you're shaving.  You're completely nude.  How tall are you?  This could, by the way, ruin the bit.  I am, I think like 5'1 or 5'2.  5'2.  I'm not exactly sure.  What, are you stretched out in that bathtub?  No, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't keep trying.  All right.  It depends on what kind of shoes I have on. 
[02:25:30]  You're petite.  All right.  5'2, how much do you weigh?  I weigh 108.  Oh, okay.  So far, so good.  You passed the second.  That's good.  Two questions done.  You've reached the third plateau.  Yes.  What color hair do you have?  I have, I'm a brunette.  I have brown hair.  All right.  With like highlights in there.  Yeah, it gets like lighter with the sunlight.  You know, by the way, there's only one incorrect answer to that question. 
[02:26:00]  The fiery red hair.  Ronald McDonald red, fiery, curly red hair.  What did you say?  What about Dave?  I hate him.  Did you hear me cuss him out the other day, Anthony?  No, I didn't hear that.  Dave.  There was a show that was on the other day, and I got into a big, huge argument with him,  and he kept calling me a pothead.  Oh, right.  Okay.  No, I do remember you then.  I was listening to that.  It was great.  Leave Dave alone.  Dave is a stand-up guy. 
[02:26:30]  Dave is so retarded, he doesn't even know when people are telling him that he's retarded.  Like, when you give him hints that he's an ass, he doesn't even get it.  He needs to come and get some time with Opie, so Opie can just blatantly tell him that he's  a fucking...  What, Eastside Dave?  Yeah.  I thought I would...  He's a dipshit, though.  I thought I would hate Eastside Dave, I'll be honest with you.  Me too.  And I like the kid.  The guy's...  He's hysterical.  When he came in and got that bare-bottom spanking and gave us those noises, and then 
[02:27:00]  the welts on his butt, I'm like, I can never hate this kid.  He'll do anything.  He has no...  Well, he is the kind of guy you guys like for your show, but...  Well, he has no line.  He will do anything.  He is like a faithful lab.  Just so he can get some mic time.  You can respect that.  Like, Pissy was his friend, and now...  Then he got...  He totally filled Pissy out as soon as he could talk about him on the mic.  Right.  All right.  He knows who makes good radio.  What's your bra size? 
[02:27:30]  We want to get to know a little more about you.  I guess I'm like a 34 C.  Maybe a C.  I don't know.  It depends on if I eat a lot or not.  Or that time of the month when you can cut your stomach in your booth.  She eats and her boobs get bigger.  When I gain weight, that's where I gain weight at.  All right.  We'll split the difference.  We'll give you a full B.  That's okay, as far as this show goes.  34 full B is fine.  Take care.  Do you masturbate when the boyfriend's out of the house?  Sometimes.  And what do you use? 
[02:28:00]  A vibrator.  Vibrator.  Do you have a name for your vibrator?  No.  It's just a...  What color is the vibrator?  Very important.  What color tells a lot about a woman?  It's pink, but I didn't buy it.  Pink's okay.  Oh, you didn't buy it?  I didn't get it.  He got it.  From your mom.  All right.  Very good.  Anything else on your mind as you shave your legs in the tub naked?  Just that I love you guys.  And my friend that I'm bringing to the virus, if I come here to the traveling virus to Vegas, 
[02:28:30]  she's really hot.  And she's dumb as shit.  That's a perfect woman, right there.  Hot and dumb as shit.  She's really hot, and she's like the most asinine girl you'll ever meet in your life.  Are you a pothead?  You really sound like you smoke pot.  Do I?  No.  No?  You too.  What's your thoughts on American Idol?  A lot of chatter on that today with Sonja.  I don't really watch it.  I watch that guy, though.  That Sonja guy. 
[02:29:00]  See, that's what we're getting at.  That's it.  Everyone is watching because of him.  He knows how to market himself.  Did you see?  What is up with all these people?  They're fucking freaks, man.  Who?  The people that are like the guy that's on the billboard until Sonja gets kicked off.  The only reason he's going to win if he does is because he's an Indian.  Because they need one of those now.  They had a black one.  They had a white one.  They had a...  Yeah, it's got to look like...  He's not going to...  You know, it has to be racially...  Got to look like a Sonny D commercial. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Sonny D.  He's not going to win in the end.  We know that.  Has that little girl, the little whatever her name is, Doolittle,  has she pretended like she didn't know she was a good singer the whole entire time?  Yeah, I think some of that is an act now, I'm thinking.  You can watch it a little bit.  Well, I think all of it is an act.  If they tell you the first couple times you're a good singer, apparently you are.  Right.  Enough about that.  Hey, do you shave your snatch?  Yeah.  Do you shave your snatch right now?  Here, give us one shave of the snatch while we've got you on the phone. 
[02:30:00]  I can't hear it.  I don't have any hair on it.  I don't let it grow until it's...  I don't let a bush grow.  But can't you put the phone down there while you scrape with the razor?  We've got to hold one minute.  Let's hear.  Okay.  Where is Jimmy?  What are you doing?  Where's he at?  Well, let's hear.  Hold on one second.  I have to lather it up and then I can do it.  Do you get the part about how we've changed your career, too? 
[02:30:30]  I don't want to get a razor burn.  Okay.  Okay, hold on.  Okay.  Okay, here we go.  Did you hear it?  I heard a little something.  It sounds like you shave every two hours.  Yeah, it's very smooth down there.  Two hours.  What's the point of shaving if you let it grow all the way in?  Oh, exactly.  Do you shave all the way under...  You get less razor burn.  You get less razor burn if you shave more often.  Do you shave underneath over there? 
[02:31:00]  You shave the lips and right up to your asshole?  I don't want my butt to have hair on there.  No.  It looks gross.  I used to be...  I used to dance.  And there were girls who would come in and they'd dance.  I think they pulled their panties down and their butt hole was really hairy.  And they got a hairy little asshole?  And I think it's gross.  Oh, no.  See, I want all this.  All right.  Listen, Diana, because you brought it up, you know, talking about Dice and we got a,  you know, we got a massive feud going on with him and we honestly have no idea where 
[02:31:30]  it came from.  No clue.  And when Dice was doing our show back in the day when we were at NEW, which really isn't  that long ago, he said some horrific things about Howard and praised us and said how we  saved his career.  And here's an actual...  He had the hat.  Here's an actual...  He got the hat.  Yeah, here's an actual article from Stepping Out Magazine.  So it's in the words of Andrew Dice Clay, okay?  Just in case people think we're, you know, making shit up here.  In this week's Stepping Out Magazine, Andrew Dice Clay said the following to Chauncey Hayden 
[02:32:00]  about his long battle with Howard Stern and how Opie and Anthony saved his career.  And then Chauncey, because he doesn't like us, has to put in parentheses how sad that  we actually saved his career.  Let's see.  The last time we spoke, it had to be five years...  You want to do the Dice part and I'll do Chauncey?  Oh, okay.  All right?  I'll be Chauncey Hayden.  The last time we spoke, it had to be...  Can I suck your cock?  Oh.  They didn't highlight all the good stuff, so we're going to start right from the beginning 
[02:32:30]  here.  Mr. Dice Clay.  The last time we spoke, it had to be five years ago.  You got in hot water with Howard Stern for saying that you didn't think he was funny  anymore.  We know what that escalated into.  I got more lines?  I don't know.  All right.  Maybe not.  Okay.  What followed was months of daily verbal assaults directed toward you from Stern?  I don't think I ever heard Howard sound so angry at anyone before or since.  Maybe hurt is a better word than angry. 
[02:33:00]  Did you think Howard felt betrayed by you?  I don't know if he was hurt or betrayed.  I just think he snapped.  I don't think I said anything that bad about him during that interview I did with you.  But sometimes you put a mirror in somebody's face, they get angry.  Especially me.  I got black hair and gray sideburns and big stupid cataract glasses and I'm a fat jackass. 
[02:33:30]  I remember what I said to you and it wasn't that bad, but he was lazy about it when it came  to confronting me on the air.  He went right to the phones and I remember sitting there and saying, what are you doing?  We didn't even talk yet.  To be honest, I felt he was very weak about the whole situation rather than just doing  another great radio show with me.  But my argument with Stern started way before that. 
[02:34:00]  In fact, there were more arguments off the air than on the air.  Oh!  So you were fighting with Howard off the air as well during that time?  Suck my cock!  What about?  What were you fighting about there, Dice?  There were things that used to bug me about him.  And I would call him at home about it.  Then that would transfer me to being on the air.  So it didn't matter what we were talking about on air.  Because his real problem was with what I said to him off the air. 
[02:34:30]  That thing I said there.  What is Dice talking about?  I don't know.  Right now I just feel the guy's going through a very confused time of his life.  What did Howard do that provoked you to call him off the air and confront him about it?  We were having ass sex together, me and him.  And I'm fucking him in the air.  It's hot. 
[02:35:00]  By the way, Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside.  Call this segment, you know, talking about Diana shaving her thing there.  Call this segment Shooting the Shit While Shaving the Clit.  Oh!  I have to say I'm the first one who has done this, huh?  Well, we're going to have other girls, you know.  You started something, but we're going to have naked girls just chattering with us about what's on their mind.  They're all going to be fat, though.  But you have to be naked to do it.  Go ahead.  So, hold on, hold on.  Let's get back to the bit.  So, what did Howard do that provoked you to call him off the air and confront him about it? 
[02:35:30]  Real answer.  The first thing he did was make fun of Ryan White when he died of AIDS.  He was just a little boy.  Is that really what he was mad at?  Yeah, I remember this.  Why did that, like, strike an nerve with Dice?  Because he doesn't fuck with stuff like that.  He's a very sinful guy, Dice.  Hmm.  That's fucked up.  I didn't know that.  Deep down inside.  All right, just shave your cunt and shut up.  Take care of some of those ass spiders. 
[02:36:00]  We'll get back to you in a minute or two.  Okay.  And I heard him making fun of him on the air, so later I called him at home and said,  What are you doing?  And he asked me, Oh, now you're the end-all of comedy?  I said to him, I'm not talking about comedy.  I'm talking about a baby that died.  What's the joke?  Then after that, every time I was on the air, there was a problem.  So me and Stern are nothing alike.  That's why when I'm asked about him, I say he's seedy. 
[02:36:30]  Seedy.  Other than that, I think he's very confused.  I'll tell you this, though.  If it were me, the guy who got divorced, he would have pissed all over it.  But I'm not going to go after him for those things there.  Like I said, this is a confused time in Stern's life, and no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.  Take the ribbon from your hair.  Your hair. 
[02:37:00]  I'm singing country.  Oh, my God.  I'm just not going to rip Howard apart.  That's the difference between me and Howard Stern.  He would go for the throat, but that's not how I am.  Even now, when people call me up and say, Howard ripped you apart today, I say, oh, good for him.  He's a mess.  Did his relentless on-air rants about...  Shut up, you faggot.  Hey, hey.  Hey.  Did his relentless on-air rants about your hurt, you either professionally or personally? 
[02:37:30]  Not at all, because my fans stick with me.  My fan sticks with me.  And that's the way it's always been.  That's why I'm going back to the Beacon and Madison Square Garden this week.  I found a radio show that's in it just for the fun and the laughs, and the fans have responded.  Ah, you're referring to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Wow, how old is this?  They've been a critical part of the whole thing. 
[02:38:00]  I know Anthony used to do the dice impression when I wasn't around,  and then one day I went on the air with them about a year ago,  and then five or six months ago I just started calling in,  and they gave me incentive.  They're just two guys on the air looking to have a good time.  It's not malicious.  There's no bad blood flowing.  I give those guys all the credit in the world.  And what happened to all this credit?  Yeah, well, that's why we love reading this today. 
[02:38:30]  It's because of those guys that I'm coming to New York to play the Beacon,  which sold out in 35 minutes.  Were you surprised that you could sell out a big venue like that so easily?  I actually predicted it.  I'm creskin'.  Iggy.  I'm not knocking you, but popular rock bands can't even sell out the garden these days.  What made you think you could?  I'm the only comic to ever fill that place for two nights,  and now I'm coming back.  For me, it's a reunion. 
[02:39:00]  It's a 10-year reunion.  I sold it out in 90,  and now because of Opie and Anthony,  boom, I'm back.  Also, I know the fans were hearing me at my best on the Opie and Anthony show  because these guys are the type of guys,  if you're on a roll, they'll let you go with it.  That's what I love about them.  They let me be the comic that I am on the air.  I think they're fantastic for that.  There aren't too many guys around the country  who'd let you do that.  It's normally the host of the show trying to upstage you, 
[02:39:30]  which to this day, they haven't done.  I mean, there were days we would fight and hang up on each other,  but it's all in fun.  And that's what I love about these guys.  I'm joking up here.  They're looking for the joke.  It's not hidden below the belt.  It's all about the joke.  Well, that's pretty much how he left it with him,  but somewhere along the line.  You guys should just send him that. 
[02:40:00]  You should send him flyers of that.  Huh?  You should send him flyers of that.  Like, just keep sending them and sending them.  Well...  So that he has to see it,  because I do think he was having some sort of nervous breakdown,  and I don't think that it happened all at one time.  Because I don't think they happened like that.  Well, yeah, Greg, the analyst from the fucking bathtub.  Leave me be.  Hey, I had one before, and trust me,  it doesn't...  It's something that...  And he's, like, weird, sensitive now.  You, like...  He's not the same person. 
[02:40:30]  And what's with the hip-hop clothes?  Do you never know?  He's been wearing them for a long time.  Yeah, I think it's time to drain the water out of the tub.  He's fat, and he wears his big, huge, long pants and huge sweatshirts.  Wait, are you still in the tub?  I am still in the tub.  Does your vagina look like the end of my fingers  when I get out of the shower?  No, I haven't...  No.  That's all pruned up.  It now looks like a 75-year-old vagina.  All right, listen.  Shaving your...  Wait, shooting the shit while you shave your clit is over. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  But it's a great new bit.  I love you guys.  Next time you need to shave anything,  you can give us a call, and we'll just...  It's called just shooting the shit.  Stay tuned for the next episode of  Shooting the Shit While Shaving the Clit.  Razzle-dazzle.  We better have that sweeper tomorrow.  What?  I want Sam to do it.  All right, thank you.  Oh.  Thank you, Diana.  All right, I love you guys.  All right, there she goes.  The hair on his head looks like the hair on her badge.  Well, no, her fucking... 
[02:41:30]  Her toilet seat cover.  One of those nice ones where you can't keep the seat up.  It's so cushy and puffy.  But there you go.  There's his own words, and that's how he left it with Dice.  Yeah.  And then what happened?  We have no idea to this day.  I try to ask him, you know, on the phone.  What happened?  And he decided it was better just to hang up,  so that's what he decided.  Actually, now he's the soft-spoken Dice.  Now he just talks like this.  I got a lot of things going on over here. 
[02:42:00]  Married couple has sex with Miniature Stallion on the way.  And also, remember Liz from yesterday and the day before?  No.  She's calling back again to see if her...  Oh, oh, okay, good.  We'll see if her husband gave her the rough sex  we've been trying to talk him into for the last two days, okay?  Quick break, and we'll continue.  Goodbye.  These guys, they can do whatever they want to do.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  And this is where things get ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous. 
[02:42:30]  I need to be a shocker.  Always up to no good.  Yeah, man.  I laughed so hard I had to buckle myself out of my couch.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And this is, like, the number one show in the world.  All right, Liz is going to have to hold on for a second.  Travis, sit back down.  All right.  What the fuck? 
[02:43:00]  Who brought this to our attention?  Mancow is spewing his BS.  Where?  His bullshit.  Yeah, where?  On a podcast or a blog?  The guy's got no fucking stations.  He's a fucking failure.  Look, and we'll do it right to your face.  A message for Dice.  You call our show.  We talk to you right away.  We drop everything.  And we'll discuss the problem you have with us.  And the same with Man Douche.  Call up any time.  Yeah, that'll never happen.  And we'll discuss careers. 
[02:43:30]  I don't call radio shows like yours.  Shut up.  I guess it was on Inside Radio.  There was a little blurb that Mancow is starting this responsibility and broadcasting bit or foundation for responsible radio.  And so here's a guy that made millions of dollars being a shock jock.  This is what happened.  Here's the bottom line.  So Mancow makes millions of dollars, has a mansion, and he's set for life. 
[02:44:00]  He did very well for himself doing the shock jock thing.  Janet Jackson did what she did.  And I hate to say it, and we did what we did.  That brought a lot of attention to the shock jock world.  And what happened was shock jocks in general were shut down.  Yep.  So many shows were let go or fired.  Okay.  So after the Janet Jackson thing, you had to kind of reinvent yourself.  Or you were fucked.  You were literally fucked.  Mancow could not reinvent himself to the point his hometown station, even though he's officially not from Chicago, 
[02:44:30]  but as far as radio goes, that's where he really made his name, right?  He has no major markets.  That's what I'm getting at.  His hometown station in Chicago dumped his ass.  So now he's syndicated in a bunch of very, very small, you can barely call them cities across America.  Yeah.  He's in towns.  He's in big towns, basically.  He's in towns.  He's in none of the majors.  He's not in New York.  He's not in Philly. 
[02:45:00]  He's not in Washington.  Got thrown out of L.A.  He's not in Boston.  He's not in Dallas.  He's not in San Francisco.  He's not in Chicago.  These are all cities we are heard in.  Yeah.  Okay?  And we could go on and on from there.  Then we'd drop down to cities that are not as big as those, but still very impressive.  It's still bigger than any city he's in.  Like Vegas.  Yeah.  Buffalo, New York.  Cleveland.  Yeah.  It goes on and on.  Mancow stations.  This is really it.  Okay.  All right.  We just, and we're also one of the top rated shows on all of Satellite Radio, including 
[02:45:30]  the little doggy company.  Okay?  This is Mancow's fucking stations.  Atlantic City, Cape May.  Oof.  Salisbury, Ocean City, Maryland.  Holy shit.  This guy's talking.  North Fork.  Why is this guy even fucking being acknowledged by any industry insider publication or website?  Knoxville, Tennessee.  Indianapolis.  Wow.  All right.  That's almost a big one.  Ot.  Ot. 
[02:46:00]  Ot.  Ot.  Ot.  Ot.  Ot.  Uh.  Exactly.  Ot.  Ot.  Otsego?  Otsego?  Otsego?  Otsego.  Otsego in Minneapolis.  Minnesota.  But not Minneapolis.  Minnesota somewhere.  Wausau.  Wisconsin.  Champaign, Illinois instead of Chicago.  Des Moines, but I think he lost that one, and that was a biggie.  Joplin, MS.  Joplin, Missouri. 
[02:46:30]  Warrensburg, MS.  Jamestown, North Dakota.  Holy shit.  Rapid City, South Dakota.  Hey, I've been there once.  There's 100 people living there, right?  Just saying that.  Oh, all right.  Drove through it.  Missoula, Montana, Medford.  Medford?  Oregon, and Stockton, California.  Yeah.  Wow.  Holy motherfucking irrelevant piece of shit.  Do nothing.  Fuckhead.  And with that, so we noticed that he's doing this Foundation for Responsible Broadcasting 
[02:47:00]  thing at madeinsideradio.com, so I go, Travis, why don't we take a look at this,  see what's going on with this douche?  And we find out that there's all sorts of quotes about us, and why don't you read what  you just read to us there, Travis?  All right.  Hang on.  All right.  Reading, Travis.  No, I got it.  I'm a good reader.  I got it.  Embattled former CBS radio chairman slash CEO, Joel Hollander, who was ousted this past  Monday and replaced by Dan Mason, particularly draws Mancow's ire.  This guy was the, this is Mancow's quote now. 
[02:47:30]  This guy was the NAB point man for bringing back terrestrial radio and controlled a tremendous  amount of radio time in America.  What did he do?  He brought in and promoted satellite radio shows.  That is disgraceful.  The government needs to wake up and bust satellite radio monopolies.  Can I tell you something?  The reason he's saying that, he's jealous.  Not, neither company wanted Mancow.  That, so what do you do if someone doesn't want you?  You trash them.  Here's what happened also.  When Howard went to Sirius, Mancow was crowing how he was going to be taking over Howard's 
[02:48:00]  stations.  Remember that one?  Yep.  David Lee Roth was brought in.  It bombed horribly.  When they were talking about a replacement for David Lee Roth, Mancow again perked up  and talked about how he was going to be taking over.  No one at CBS would even entertain his fucking phone calls.  Rover got those stations in the Midwest that he would have got, he wanted.  Yeah, they gave him the Rover.  He said he was going to get them nationwide. 
[02:48:30]  He assumed, this man cunt assumed he was going to get all these stations, not realizing he's  an irrelevant, preaching douchebag that no one wants to fucking hear.  We wound up getting the East Coast stations, some of the Midwest stations, and Mancow got  kicked out of Chicago.  Chicago is on, you just heard his markets, you just heard, we didn't make that shit up.  The guy is nowhere, and he's being quoted as bashing Joel Hollander for bringing us on 
[02:49:00]  board?  Podcasts have more listeners than Mancow.  Absolutely.  The guy is a waste.  There was a thread on one of the message boards last night that pointed to one of Mancow's message  boards, so I click on that because it was him discussing us, and his listeners discussing us,  and it was pathetic.  Going through this message board, even his hardcore fans have given up.  They're saying like, oh man, he's not even the same guy anymore. 
[02:49:30]  He gets on, and what used to be fun, like when, I guess, a stunt guy turd, are you there, turd?  Are you there?  All that shit, the listener who's saying was all fake, even his hardcore fans, they realized  that was all fake, he was doing the shock jock thing, and now he's just alone, and they  say all he does is preach now.  He's like a fucking preacher, this born-again preacher who has this political ideology and  this religious, almost philosophical bullshit that he rambles on every day about the same 
[02:50:00]  thing, and they say, he goes, if he would change his subject every day, I might be able to listen  to it, but he apparently gets on and preaches about living a good lifestyle and being good  to your family and friends, and it's like he turned into fucking Barney.  Does he have cancer?  That's what it sounds like.  It sounds like some guy who's ready to die, that's trying to make peace in the world after 
[02:50:30]  being a horrible human being, and he's just a fucking phony that they all know.  When they brought up the we for the we, where the woman died, and that brought his whole responsibility  and fucking whatever thing that he's trying to do, people started pointing out, hey, he  was a shock jock.  He used to do stuff that put people in danger.  And even his hardcore fans said, well, no, all that stuff he did with Turd was fake.  And a couple of people said, I was in studio when he pulled it off, and he made it sound 
[02:51:00]  a lot different on the air than what was happening in the studio.  So what they're doing is pretty much calling him out for being the phony he was when he  was a shock jock, and now he's even more of a phony.  If he wants to make a statement, why don't you make this statement, Man Cow?  Why don't you get this statement to Man Cow?  So why don't you give all the money back, and even donate to a fine charity.  All the money you made being a shock jock, that would be making a statement.  That is a hell of a statement to me. 
[02:51:30]  Instead of like typing out shit from a mansion somewhere in Chicago.  Lying.  This business did well by you.  Phony.  So why don't you give all the money back and give it to a charity?  That's making a statement.  Saying it was wrong to do that type of radio.  Let's see what kind of a man you really are.  I told you years ago, before I knew you guys, when I met him through Dice, he flew me out  to Chicago to play a rapist.  Did I ever tell you this story?  No.  To play a rapist.  I swear to God, you never told us.  Oh my God.  Holy shit.  I was brought out... 
[02:52:00]  By the way, this is something that a lot of people do know of.  All his phone calls, those phony phone calls and everything, all set up and faked.  I didn't know you were...  Oh yeah, this is way back, man.  This might be 99 or whatever it was.  I was very...  I hardly did any radio.  He liked me as a comic, but he said, I want to bring you out, not as Jim Norton, but  to play a rapist on my show.  He brought me out and they filmed it.  He made me wear these really weird glasses and this face covering like I was a rapist  who he was trying to yell at for the community. 
[02:52:30]  Oh my God.  And then he had like his...  And I knew it was kind of...  It was fake, obviously, but I knew it was really weird when he's like, I don't want you in  here to even look at him.  Like to this female sidekick or whoever she was, but she wasn't there.  Like he was just saying it like she had come into the room, but she hadn't.  Holy shit.  And he kept trying to goad me into saying things that were more fucked up.  I was just talking about being a rapist.  I don't remember what I was saying.  I'm sure I was awful.  And he's like, well, how...  So you're just telling about your real life stories and he wanted you to pick it up and 
[02:53:00]  not?  Well, he's like, well, how about kids?  I'm like, no, I don't go for kids.  I was trying to be realistic about it.  And he goes, are you sure?  Or something like that.  Oh yeah.  Well, there was one time.  Yeah.  It was really weird.  He was trying to goad me into saying like I fuck kids.  And then he filmed me for the Fox show.  That was when I was wearing like the sunglasses and the weird shirt over my face.  And he was like being like...  I have a rapist here on my show.  So yeah, a guy called up threatening to shotgun me.  It was awful. 
[02:53:30]  I was like, ugh.  That's what he does though.  They're all just phony fucking...  He just had a big phony fucking show.  And then he tries going legit.  But now all he does is preach about living a good life.  He said something like...  I was reading through this message for it.  And it's like, oh big...  And there's only a few real hardcore fans there that won't accept it.  Maybe two or three really per thread.  And they're going, oh, a cow has a big announcement coming up on the 18th. 
[02:54:00]  Wonder what it is.  And they're speculating back and forth.  And then the announcement comes up.  And it was just him saying, you ought to, you know, just be positive, your attitude.  And live a good life.  Take care of your family and friends.  And he said it was going to be the most important show of his career, this announcement.  And he just...  Give your money back.  Then you may be in a shock jock.  That makes a great suggestion.  Someone get that message to man cow. 
[02:54:30]  So what's the rest of the...  Did you read the whole...  No, of course.  All right, go ahead there, Travis.  I hate to say I was right, but I knew this would fail.  Talking about you guys.  What failed?  What failed?  I'm the only guy who said that since the beginning.  Opie and Anthony are failing miserably.  They're in last place in Chicago, and I told Joel Hollander to his face that would happen.  These are no-talent individuals, and they cannot survive in a post-Janet Jackson or post-9-11 world.  By the way, he didn't tell Joel Hollander that to his face.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  Joel Hollander wouldn't meet with fucking man cunt.  Joel used to...  Tell his stories and laugh, and he said they would play the messages to the rest of the corporate office and just laugh.  And no one returned his phone call.  Man cow would leave messages, message after message, and man cow, you asshole, it was played as a joke to all the other fucking people in corporate.  You're fucking pleading phone calls for a meeting.  You're a lying sack of shit.  Chicago ratings, the last time we looked, showed a bump up. 
[02:55:30]  Of course.  They told us it's going to be a long haul for Chicago, but they're very happy with what's going on so far.  We've got a long ways to go.  Chicago's a tough market.  You don't go in there and overnight your success.  It doesn't happen like that.  We're going live on Monday.  We're going to be heard from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m.  Because they've got Gary Meyer coming back, who's a legend in Chicago.  And if we were doing that badly, they would have gave him the whole morning show.  Trust me.  He's got a name in Chicago.  Okay?  And at least we're not in Chicago, douchebag.  And as far as the post-Janet Jackson thing goes, I was just thinking the other day that we're up to 2 1⁄2 years back on radio. 
[02:56:00]  2 1⁄2 years.  That's failing?  Close to the number one show on all of XM Satellite Radio.  One of the biggest shows in all of Satellite Radio.  That alone is very impressive.  And we're still on 25 regular radio stations.  Major markets.  Mostly major markets.  Where you're sitting there in fucking markets that no one can pronounce.  So explain where we're failing.  Where's the failure in this? 
[02:56:30]  Eight of the top 11.  And I say Boston because Atlanta recently booted.  The only top 10 not in is L.A., Houston, and now Atlanta, which Atlanta should be 11th.  But we all know what's going on down there.  Right.  So there you go.  There you go.  And we've been at this a year.  They would have kicked us off stations by now if we were failing.  Trust me.  So where's this phony fucking lump of crap getting off saying this shit?  And then he writes, how moronic is it that Opie and Anthony would be your morning show?  Look at people like former Stern replacement David Lee Roth, Westwood One's Dennis Miller, 
[02:57:00]  and Clear Channel premieres Whoopi Goldberg.  Can we stop?  There are radio people who can do this job because we know this art form.  Hey, asshole.  How are we in the same category as people that...  We've been doing radio for fucking years and been successful at it at every turn.  We have never been fucking thrown off the air because of our shitty ratings or shitty attitude.  Top of our game, we fucking hit the wall.  James Dean, motherfucker. 
[02:57:30]  That's how we went out.  How did you go out?  With a whimper.  Because your fucking bosses couldn't stand you.  And you got thrown out of your own fucking city, Chicago.  And now you're in shitty little fucking markets.  You got rid of your whole fucking staff because you think you can just pontificate all day about your bullshit beliefs  and people are going to listen.  You're a has-been fucking man, cunt.  You're done.  And why don't we stick to the facts?  When we were off the air, we were so successful that Mancow actually called our staff. 
[02:58:00]  Yep.  Wanted to fly into Chicago and interview them to maybe run his show behind the scenes.  That is a fact.  How about when he called our agent when we were sharing agents before he gave Bob the fucking boot  and asked Bob that he wanted to get together and have a meeting with us.  He was going to pay for first class tickets to Chicago and a steak dinner.  So he could hang out and meet and become like pals, I guess.  Because he wanted us to help him get a foothold in New York so we could get him into New York. 
[02:58:30]  And we said, tell him to go fuck himself.  Even back then, we knew he was just a phony lump of shit.  So get in touch with Mancow.  Open invite to call our show.  We'll discuss this in front of a real audience.  Paul, I'll be entertained to hear you fucking lie on the phone.  You are such a phony, lying sack of shit.  The guy, I've never heard an honest word come out of that fucking douchebag's mouth.  And once again, give up the money you made being a shock jock. 
[02:59:00]  That would make a statement.  Yeah, there's a challenge.  That's a huge statement that you would make.  You want to fucking talk about shock jock radio and you've changed after 9-11 and the birth of your fucking kids or whatever the fuck it is that turned your head around.  Make a statement.  Take all the money you made over all the years of being a shock jock and give it to a charity.  And start over.  Start over in your fucking shit markets and see how well you do.  All right, hold on a minute. 
[02:59:30]  Man, I got a communicate thing going on here.  From who?  Oh, is that guy a cunt?  Oh.  Man Cow was dropped from Des Moines two weeks ago.  Yeah, there you go.  More success in Man Cow's fucking...  He...  This guy's calling us a failure.  How do you spin that?  All right.  How does a fucking guy spin that?  A failure.  I will go on record as saying, Man Cow, more hated and more of a douchebag to me, personally, than Howard Stern is. 
[03:00:00]  Man Cow, bigger fucking douchebag, more hated by me than Howard.  And that's a tough nut to crack.  I still...  Number one with me?  Number one douchebag in radio.  Ron Bennington.  Still.  To this day.  It'll never change with me.  Never.  Wasn't even...  Never.  I wasn't even going to go there.  We have to work with these people, that's why.  Oh.  Yeah.  What about whiny Fez Watley?  Ugh. 
[03:00:30]  Enough already.  Okay.  Enough already.  We get it.  You got fucking issues.  Get over it.  And hit send.  All right.  I think we'll make a little...  I think we're going to make a radio website today.  Well, I hope so, because I really need a fucking response to this.  The big thing, the points I want to get across, Opie's point on him giving back his shock jock money. 
[03:01:00]  If he's got such this fucking holy roller viewpoint now.  It's dirty money, so give it back.  Filthy tip.  Give every penny back you made for being a shock jock.  And how does this fucking idiot get off calling us a failure when we are, right now, the biggest fucking things in radio, we're syndicated and on satellite, we're covering both mediums, we're in major markets, and this fucking idiot is losing shit markets and calling us a failure? 
[03:01:30]  No one heard him call us a failure unless it was in print, unless fucking Travis had to instigate it and bring it in.  What blog was that on?  I don't know, a fan found it.  I'm passing the buck.  That fucking useless asshole.  I hope they got our quotes right, because I sent a little communique.  So we want to put out the challenge.  We encourage him to give all the money back that he made being a shock jock, and that would make a real statement. 
[03:02:00]  He could call our show.  What was the other thing?  Oh, and please mention the Jim Norton rape thing.  That's terrific.  Yeah, the phony fucking rape acting thing Jimmy did.  What'd you do with your hands?  Oh, I pushed it.  I put them around my own throat, the awful performance I was giving.  You know, there was a service out there, and I heard things over the years that even Howard was using this service, where they play act for you.  They would call in.  They would give you professional callers.  They'd give an outrageous story for you to jazz up your show, and then you write a little check off to them. 
[03:02:30]  Check off.  Complete phony.  We put the creatures in our bodies.  Complete phony radio.  So I'm waiting to see if I'm going to get a reply to what I just wrote.  This fucking guy.  We were off for two years.  We were in exile.  For two fucking years, we weren't allowed to say boo on the fucking radio.  We came back and got back more markets than we did when we fucking left, and we're on satellite radio at the same time.  This fucking idiot gets thrown off the air in his major market of Chicago. 
[03:03:00]  He's in shit markets and calling us failures?  We had to build back up from nothing.  If you remember, asshole, you were on TV saying we were blackballed never getting a fucking job again.  That we were done in the business.  They're done.  Done in the business.  Well, look who's at the top of the pyramid now, ass cunt.  Sounds like someone's a little jealous.  A little fucking jealous.  Jealous.  Jealous.  I feel like singing. 
[03:03:30]  I'm angry.  Oh.  That guy is a douchebag and a liar.  Excuse me, but Canada is just yelling at us through the instant feedback.  And you're on in Canada.  That counts as XM, you silly geese.  Well, I'd rather be on in Des Moines than Canada.  Absolutely.  State number 51.  They're standing on guard for thee, though.  Right.  Whatever that means.  They're right there.  Our neighbors to the north.  How do you stand on guard for thee?  That means you're not really doing the heavy lifting.  You're just taking a look.  You know what it would be like?  Just watching.  A couple of million screaming guys hitting you with hockey sticks? 
[03:04:00]  That would be scary.  Hold it.  Wait.  Well, that was a good one.  I liked it, Ant.  You had to wait a minute.  Let it sink in.  I don't know.  Let it sink into the soil.  Hold on.  Communicate coming in.  Bang is a thumbs down.  I can.  I respect his opinion.  He's wearing a Paul R. Nelson shirt.  All right.  Here we go.  I can do this, but what about this idea?  Let me contact Mandouche's people and set up an FMQB interview with him, and then I'll 
[03:04:30]  dial you guys in on the inter...  Oh, maybe I shouldn't have read that on there.  Yeah, I probably should now.  That'd be good.  Ooh, I should pre-read it.  Good.  No fear over here.  You will get no fucking fear on this show.  We take the calls.  If man cunt wanted to call in and talk, fine.  If man cunt wanted us to call him, that's fine, too.  Whatever the fucking situation, this lying sack wants to talk, because he'll be exposed  as the liar that he is, as the phony that he is, and the has-been, the thing that bugs 
[03:05:00]  him the most.  You're a has-been.  You had your moment.  I'm getting info on Otsego.  Otsego.  One of his markets.  Matt in Minnesota.  What's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  I'm a courier.  I actually drive through Otsego, and it's a shitbox town with nothing but fucking Amish  people.  Wow.  He's on in an Amish community? 
[03:05:30]  And we're failures?  Holy shit.  And we're failures?  I see the little horse and buggies that drive around.  Well, that must explain it.  They hear man count and think it's a relationship show.  Very good.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  Is that good?  See, if you want to hear real serious political talk or responsible talk, like Rush Limbaugh  and Hannity, I mean, those guys do it really, like, that's what they do.  So why wouldn't you listen to them?  Whether you like their opinions or you hate them, that's the way it's done. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Hannity has made a very lucrative career with political talk.  The guy, he knows what he's doing.  Mike Savage.  Yeah.  Man count doesn't, you don't go from shock jockery to fucking this holy roller, you're  born again, fucking 9-11 affected you so much, the birth of my kids that you're going to  start being this guy.  Because first of all, he's stupid. 
[03:06:30]  He's not an intelligent guy.  That's another thing.  He's not one of these guys.  Hannity is intelligent.  The guy can carry on a conversation.  He's educated.  When you talk to him about a subject, he'll give you an educated opinion or an educated  synopsis of a situation that you're talking about.  Mancow's a dummy.  The guy talks about stuff, he's talking out his ass.  Well, that's why the delivery.  Yeah, he's got to have the big shock jock voice still. 
[03:07:00]  When you have that type of delivery, that means you have nothing really to say, and  you're distracting people with this delivery.  Yeah, with the delivery, I have absolutely nothing on this.  I'm stupid.  I'm an idiot.  He doesn't know what he's fucking talking about.  But he thinks he can make that transition, and his core audience told him to go fuck himself.  Well, listen to this quote.  Ironically, though, the mega personality now invading America, that's the  name of his show, Now Invading America.  NIA?  Yeah, okay.  Now Invading America. 
[03:07:30]  Right?  Is he doing it old school with those wagons, those covered wagons?  A Conestoga wagon?  Right.  Is that how he's invading America, slowly but surely?  Very slowly.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I'm invading America.  Oh, do I fucking hate him. 
[03:08:00]  God.  The guy is a fraud.  Just dial that number and I'll pick it up from here.  A fraud?  A dope?  A dummy?  Ironically, though, the mega personality now invading America,  because that's the name of his show, isn't heard in his Chicago base.  And then he says, we've had offers.  No, you haven't.  We've had offers, maintains Mancow, who occasionally speaks in the third person. 
[03:08:30]  Of course he does.  CBS has gone around and around with me.  Several other companies would be naturals and are on hold.  I haven't found the right station yet.  You are fucking a bullshitting asshole.  How long are you going to wait?  I'll tell you something about the business.  This business is so desperate for talent right now.  Oh, my God.  That's why we're on in 25.  Why do you think we're fucking hired?  That's why we're on in 25 cities.  They would love to find someone else for these other holes. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, they would love it.  I'm not talking about other companies.  Trust me.  They would love to get a show that could go up against us in some of these cities.  They can't find it.  They knew we were the only fucking game in town that could get on the radio and get an audience.  With our background, you'd be crazy to hire us.  Yeah.  We have a background of self-fucking destruction, and we take bosses down with us.  That's why they are afraid to hire us.  When we get thrown out the door, suits follow us. 
[03:09:30]  All right.  But this man cock is saying that offers are going to...  What a lying douche.  Well, I guess they're going to write about it on one of the websites.  Don't blow it this time around.  Remember the last time we gave this scoop to somebody?  Yeah.  It's ringing.  Where is it?  Five.  Oh, okay.  Pick it up.  Hello?  Hello?  Might have been a little too slow.  What was that?  Hello?  Call again.  Call again.  Call over here, though.  Yeah, do it here. 
[03:10:00]  And plop it down immediately.  I think I can do it here.  Yeah?  Don't yell.  I don't know how to touch that thing.  I'll try it.  All right.  Don't take the handset and run off with it.  It's a fun gag.  It's a fun gag to give to your girlfriend, Travis, because his ear hurts.  Oh, oh, pick it up.  What line?  What line?  Five.  Five.  Hello?  Okay.  Different voice. 
[03:10:30]  Mancow, what's your topic?  Hi, how are you doing?  I'm great.  What do you want to say to Mancow?  Want to talk to the cow today?  A little bit about this situation with Britain and the sailors.  Okay, what do you want to say about that?  I want to say I believe that the United States is being kept out of this by Britain because we have such a bad world view that people look at the United States as troublemakers, and I think Britain is kind of snubbing us on this one. 
[03:11:00]  Okay, so they're keeping the USA out of it?  Yeah, it's a statement that has been released from Britain that wants the United States to lay back on this and not get involved.  We should be all over this subject, all over it, and the president's not even commenting, and that is because Britain has told us not to because the world view of the United States is very poor, and this wouldn't help. 
[03:11:30]  They said it wouldn't help for the United States to become involved.  Huh.  What's your first name?  Tony.  Where are you calling from?  Calling from New York.  Listening online.  Very good.  A couple of things for the show, man.  Got to keep your radio or your audio down.  Got it.  Keep your comments clean, short and sweet, to the point, and start off by saying, Mancow, love you, love your show, okay?  You got it. 
[03:12:00]  Thank you, sir.  One moment.  Thank you.  A phony, fake, degenerate, low-life paper.  I know you didn't ask me, and you didn't want me to read anything, but I'm not reading it.  I'm just telling it to you.  Jackie.  Well, you know how when you read a book?  Jackie Mason.  You know he does a one-man show on Broadway.  You understand.  Now I know why.  Now I know why.  You read a book, you hear a voice in your head as you're reading.  When I was reading this book earlier today, I was hearing Jackie Mason's voice as I'm reading the book.  You have a great voice.  Hey, Jackie.  What I always love about Susan sure is dumb with her bug eyes and her thyroid problems, she looks like a Simpsons character, and everybody always talks about her like she's so lovely. 
[03:12:30]  Isn't she beautiful?  Susan sure is dumb.  And I think she's a hideous blow pig.  And you also mentioned Harry Belafonte.  We used to kill people for treason.  Treason is still the only thing in the Constitution that's punishable by death.  This guy is cavorting with dictators that have sworn the death of all Americans, and they're over there partying with him.  You know, I had Robert Duvall on this program, and he said he'll never work with Steven Spielberg again.  Spielberg vacation with Oliver Stone and Fidel Castro. 
[03:13:00]  Why aren't these people held accountable?  Well, the truth of the matter is that they're all treasonous characters.  And all of the whole Hollywood crowd hates America, whatever the causes or the purposes that America is involved with.  All they have is hate and contempt for this country, and they will destroy this country in a second.  They feel so comfortable and rich, and they're jammed up with millions.  And all they do is lecture everybody else about how to take care of this country, how to have decency, how to have love, while they're destroying America. 
[03:13:30]  They tell you not to drive a car or make sure it's a small car, don't use an SUV.  Meanwhile, they're landing in private planes all over the neighborhood.  You use more emissions than a private plane going on a block and a half than an SUV driving for a month.  They have no conscience whatsoever.  They're all frauds and fakes about every issue.  All of a sudden, they're experts.  What?  No, I'm just helping you out here.  Well, I'm glad to hear it.  It's about time you helped me out. 
[03:14:00]  I did a lot for your career.  Why do you think you got your own show now?  Not for me.  That's never what will happen.  Wait a minute.  Speaking of fakes, Jackie, how about all these celebrities bogarting on your religion with the Kabbalah?  This Kabbalah business is the biggest fake in the world.  This Madonna needs a new kind of an image every week and a half.  First, she's a sex maniac.  A week later, she's the most religious woman in the world.  Then when she gets finished with religion, she finds children in Africa.  Then she becomes degenerate again for two weeks, doing sex pictures and sex numbers and flying all around like a degenerate. 
[03:14:30]  An hour later, she'll pick up another religion.  Two weeks from now, she'll be an African missionary.  You know, you talk about these schmucks.  You know, hey, man, Bill Gates doesn't let his daughter on the computer unsupervised.  Madonna doesn't let her kid turn on the TV.  Her kids can't watch TV.  But it's okay for our children and all the crap she's given us.  But what about Starbucks? 
[03:15:00]  Oh, excuse me.  I'm talking.  Starbucks is one of, when I talk about schmucks, I detect the guy from Starbucks who created a way to charge $4.50 and $5.50 for 80 cents worth of coffee.  This is, and not only that, he sells you a burnt coffee, which gets you nauseous, and everybody tells you, oh, it's a special bean from Argentina.  It's not a bean from Argentina.  It's a schmuck from New York.  Yeah!  Woo!  Oh, man. 
[03:15:30]  That is awesome.  Get it.  He is.  He is.  He is awesome.  I get talking to him every day.  He's, uh, he's, he's, he's, he's worked up.  Jackie, thank you.  It's the Man Count Show.  God bless you.  God bless you.  Thanks a lot for being here.  And don't forget, don't forget, I'm not reading from a book.  The Man Counts Morning Madhouse on the pre-speech radio network. 
[03:16:00]  Hello?  Hello?  I guess I'm still on hold.  Must be something with the, uh, commercials. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  Anyway, so, uh, we're here.  What did you just do?  Huh?  What'd you just do?  Um, Travis has it?  So we could talk?  Uh, yeah.  I hope, boy. 
[03:17:00]  I hope that'll pop right to me.  If they do, Travis, just wave it at them.  Oh, my God, throw yourself through the friggin' window.  Make sure you're in.  Jeez.  Do they have caller ID, I think, anything they knew?  I don't know.  It seems like they went to spots, and that's when it cut off.  Yeah, that's what happened, so.  And again, it wouldn't say, love you, love the show.  No, yeah, we're still on.  Oh, my God.  Love you.  What?  If you pick up from here, it's gonna have that little rip noise, like radio has when you answer the phones.  Yeah, we're gonna have to go back to it at some point. 
[03:17:30]  You know, the spots run through.  We can't just sit there in silence, though, for you.  Yeah, that's the problem.  He has no commercials.  What?  He's running it out of a studio, so he has no station, so it's a dead feed.  It certainly is.  He's doing a show for nobody.  Love you, love the show.  The screen has gotta tell people to say that.  Get the fuck out of here.  How bad is that?  Aaron said that, uh...  Oh, it's gonna make me fucking throw up a little bit to say it.  Aaron, uh, Aaron says, uh, you're listening live to Mancow's audience right now. 
[03:18:00]  That's why the, uh...  The silence.  The dead feed.  That's great.  If he just listens to one of the guys.  They'll probably come in with a bumper or some shit, though.  Yeah, absolutely.  Hey, soon as you hear a bumper.  As soon as you hear a bumper, uh...  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  See, we're not scared of confrontation.  We'll love him.  Never have been scared.  We've never been scared of confrontation.  I was afraid.  I thought I wasn't selling my fucking topic good enough.  Then I had... 
[03:18:30]  Then I got more energy.  Like, I had to just put more energy behind my stupid topic.  Ah, yeah.  Still dead air?  How many minutes?  They probably are like five minutes.  Thank God that's satellite radio.  We don't have...  Yeah, it's satellite.  That's why.  This is what satellite's built for.  Yeah, chill out and just go get a beer or something.  Just enjoy it.  Exactly.  Sit back.  Have fun.  That's right.  Do you think I have time to pee?  I have to piss my head.  No, I don't...  Oof.  Yeah, you better pee.  Do I have time?  Huh?  Pee fast. 
[03:19:00]  It's not something we can hold.  Okay, if he comes back on, just say, look, this is the OPF in the show.  Can you wait?  Yeah, Jimmy's taking a pee.  How great is it?  We never tell you guys what to do.  That call screen goes, make sure you say, what?  Love you.  Love you.  Love you.  Love you.  Say, man, cow.  Love you.  Love the show.  But let's understand from now on, callers.  Yes, callers.  By the way, we are stealing that.  We demand.  We demand, you say.  We don't acknowledge you.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Jim.  Love you.  Love the show.  But that's... 
[03:19:30]  No, they can just say, Opie, that's fun.  But that's not flowery enough.  Travis?  It doesn't say anything.  You'll be screening calls, so you tell everybody that's what they're there to say.  What a fucking...  What a phony.  I don't think that's strong enough.  You've got to tell your own audience to say that to love you.  I thank God every morning for you and the show.  There's got to be something...  I don't think love you love the show is...  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  No.  No.  I'm going to pee real quick.  They're eagerly awaiting.  Elliot from Philly.  Get a beer.  It's 10 a.m. 
[03:20:00]  Opie.  Well, it's happy hour somewhere.  Whatever.  Whatever you've got to get.  It's 5 o'clock somewhere.  No.  Oh.  Go.  Go.  I find that listening to the show with tinfoil wrapped around my head gives me the amazing ability to... 
[03:20:30]  It's Craptacular Thursday.  Here with a man cow on the free speech ring.  Hey, it's Faith.  Man cow's intern with the word on the street.  Oh, hey, Faith.  I'm out here finding out what people think of American Idol's Sinjaya.  I don't even know because I haven't been watching.  Do you watch American Idol?  No.  I don't care one way or the other.  I really am not familiar with it.  I do not watch TV.  I speak a little.  That's my thing.  Well, I think he should be gone.  Yeah.  He should.  He should be.  Are you worried that he's going to win? 
[03:21:00]  No, I don't think he's going to win.  He can't sing.  He sounds horrible.  And I think it's just a popularity contest.  And I've been watching American Idol since, like, they first started.  Are you afraid he might win?  Yeah, that's the scary part.  And he can't sing because they like the way he looks.  He is a nice-looking young man.  Do you watch American Idol?  No.  This has been Faith with the word on the street.  Thanks, Cal.  Back to you in the studio.  Don't set this place on fire.  Don't set this place on fire. 
[03:21:30]  Don't set this place on fire.  Matt, hello.  Welcome to the program.  Man, Cal.  Love you.  Love your show.  Thank you, sir.  I was just about to topic on with the reverend, or the pastor, whatever he is.  That's okay.  But I applaud him for having the ball to get up and do something that nobody else will do.  And taking some of these dirty, nasty people up off the streets of ours.  We get the point, and we get the sentiment.  All right.  So, Sam Childers, you can go on the Internet and find him.  They have done hours of TV on this guy, and he sees really brutal stuff in Uganda. 
[03:22:00]  There is a...  What is this guy's name?  Coach.  Joseph Coney.  Uh-huh.  And what does he do?  I mean, what is he doing?  Why is he doing it?  See, actually, what makes him one of the world's worst terrorists is he don't have agenda.  He's just out there killing.  Why do people follow him?  Why don't people turn on him?  It has a lot to do, okay, with witchcraft.  Uh-huh.  And he takes the children, brainwashes them, the people, he brainwashes them, and ends up turning them into killers. 
[03:22:30]  How many kids has he converted to killers?  It's like you see in the movie Blood Diamond.  This is a Leonardo DiCaprio movie.  I think the ads were horrible for it.  I think it's a great movie.  About 100,000 children right now.  He's converted.  Yeah.  So how old are the kids who are going and killing other people?  I have one child on our orphanage right now that we rescued, 11 years old, that killed over 30 people.  How were you able to get in and get out? 
[03:23:00]  Wait, wait, before we get to that, and they always have them kill their own parents, right?  Yeah.  Wow.  And how do you get them?  Why aren't you dead?  You've been able to rescue all of you.  Well, I'm not dead because of Jesus Christ.  But most of these children, when they see me coming, they'll actually throw their guns down.  I have never, never had to lift my gun ever on a child.  Marie, hello.  Throw their guns.  Hey, man, Cal.  Love you.  Love your show.  Hi.  What's up?  I just wanted to say that the preacher man is awesome, and he's completely justified in what he does. 
[03:23:30]  Like, my uncle is a minister, and he says, if you're not motivated by the seven deadly sins, then you're good, you know?  Yeah.  Well, he seems to me he's got his heart in the right place, but some people take offense to it.  He won't admit that he does it, but he's not going to say it on the radio, I guess.  But, I mean, he's got a gun, and he goes in, and these are violent areas, and there's gunfire.  Can I ask you this?  Does Osama bin Laden have his heart in the right place?  He thinks he does. 
[03:24:00]  I don't know what that means.  Well, you're saying that the pastor here has his heart in the right place.  Yeah, but...  So does Osama bin Laden think he has his heart in the right place.  But Osama doesn't want to kill children.  You know, Osama...  God, what?  He wants to kill me?  No.  He wants to kill you?  I mean, Osama bin Laden wants to hurt people.  This guy doesn't want to hurt people.  He wants to help people.  But he will hurt somebody if he has to.  You said you've never had to raise your gun on a child.  What if you're coming into that village, and those children have their guns aimed at you? 
[03:24:30]  And it's you or them.  Jew.  How about if somebody started beating the snot out of you right now?  What would you do?  I'd fight back.  Oh, okay.  Dan, hello.  Welcome to the program.  Hey, I want to say that I really think that Sam Childers is doing a good thing.  I think that if you're not supporting him, then you're supporting the terrorist that he's fighting.  And if I had that man in my sight, I wouldn't have a second hesitation about pulling the trigger.  I wouldn't.  But I'm not a preacher.  I wouldn't have a problem killing this bad guy.  And I don't have a problem doing that.  I really don't. 
[03:25:00]  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, hello.  Hi, man, Cal.  Love you, love your show.  Love you, love your show, man, Cal.  Thank you, sir.  I believe the worst thing in the world is when good men or women do nothing.  Well, that's the old saying, isn't it?  When good people do nothing.  Al, I think you're a symptom of this country that we sit and debate things like this.  This man is cutting off babies' arms and legs and raping them and killing, and he's going in and fighting that.  In that order?  And you're debating if he's like Osama bin Laden. 
[03:25:30]  I mean, that's just the most asinine thing, but I understand it's what everybody does.  How about he's a good guy, they're not?  It's that simple.  I believe he's a good guy, but he's saying that he would, I'm saying that he, he says he would kill if he has to.  Yeah.  But if he would kill if he has to, and if he ends up killing, then what does that make him?  Does that still make him a good guy?  How you doing?  This is Christopher Walken.  We're doing Christopher Walken Theater.  This could be a lot more complex. 
[03:26:00]  I mean, it's not just, it might not just be such a simple, you know, you think, you know the movie.  If you do, then call 1-888-2-MAN-COW.  Tony in New York, hello.  Mankow, love you, love the show, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I want to talk a little bit about this Britain situation with the sailors that were taken hostage, as I see it. 
[03:26:30]  There's a problem.  I don't see the president speaking out on this, and now I'm hearing that the United States has been told not to comment by Britain because of the worldview of our country.  The British are telling us to please stay out of this so as not to make trouble.  I see this as maybe Britain turning on us a little bit as an ally in this situation. 
[03:27:00]  What do you think about this?  Well, I think that's a brilliant thing.  I think that's a brilliant question.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mankow.  I think we need to keep our nose out of it right now.  I think we got all over like that.  Well, Sam Childers knew this pygmy woman in Uganda.  She's a nice girl.  She's always sticking her nose in people's business.  And I think we need to keep our nose out of everybody's business right now.  And I think England is saying, let us handle it.  And I'm okay with that for now.  But you better believe if it starts to hit the fan, once again, we'll be there to save them. 
[03:27:30]  It's the Mankow Show.  Mankow.  Fuckers cut me off.  I knew that was going to happen, too.  Yeah, you should have done them in the middle.  It was tough, though.  It was actually a valid question.  I was waiting to come back.  That's why I said, do you?  Like shit like that.  Wouldn't it be funny if Anthony just became a caller to the Mankow Show and never confronted him with his main point?  That's pretty much what just happened, Jimmy.  I just gave him a good fucking call.  Fuck.  Wow, way to go.  How funny would it be if someone overheard that and thought he handled such a... 
[03:28:00]  Like, this is what we're looking for.  And all of a sudden, we were fired.  And he was put on in every market.  Thanks a lot for nothing.  That's brilliant.  All right, listen.  We'll take a quick break.  Hold on.  Why don't you just call him as Reagan and do some impressions for him?  Hello, Mankow.  We'll do something next.  Go.  This is a very special show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those chugs.  You opio puto cine megalo queomorfo. 
[03:28:30]  They will exercise restraint.  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kid.  The O.D. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.D. and Anthony Show.  Lots going on today.  We have to talk quietly.  Oh.  Anthony's on hold. 
[03:29:00]  Um, so what else is going on, Jimmy?  I'm okay.  I just want to make sure we don't say opening anything when your old trainer picks up.  You want to go play two minutes in the closet?  Oh, my God.  I forgot that game existed.  Um.  I would always play with retarded girls, and I would bring a stopwatch, and it would  be three and a half hours in the closet, but they didn't know any better.  They just assumed it was two minutes, right?  Yes.  Broomstick.  Yes.  Yeah.  I called it my sock, and they would clean it.  It's a fun opportunity for you to promote upcoming gigs as we, uh, stall here. 
[03:29:30]  I don't have any.  No.  Let's promote our in-studio guests.  We have Kurt Russell tomorrow.  We have Black Sabbath Monday, and we have Quentin Tarantino on Tuesday.  My name's Steve from Denver, and, uh, I can't agree with Mankow on the, uh, England-America  situation that we ought to keep our nose out of this.  That is just preposterous.  I don't understand why he would even, uh, say something like that. 
[03:30:00]  This is why the Muslims are ruling the globe.  Uh, Anthony.  Good.  Put Mankow on.  Put Mankow on, you fucking cocksucker.  Put him on.  I won't curse.  I won't curse.  Put him on.  That's phony.  Put him on.  Put him on.  Did you hang up?  Yeah, the pest ruined it. 
[03:30:30]  What'd they do?  He goes, oh, yeah?  Is this Opie or Anthony?  Ah, Anthony, you fuck.  Ah, you know what it is?  He won't go on.  What a pussy.  Pussy.  Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.  The pest ruined it.  Pussy.  The pest ruined it.  They ruin everything.  Well, what's the phone number?  Now we ruin his show for a very long time to come.  This is...  Let her rip, pests.  Let her rip.  What's the phone number?  What?  888-2-MAN-COW.  888-2-MAN-COW.  Ask him why he won't talk to us. 
[03:31:00]  He's all brave in print.  Brave guy in print.  Oh.  What happened?  Won't fucking talk on the air.  Uh, they are aware someone called while it was on and informed them he was Anthony.  Who the fuck would do that?  Maybe a Mancow fan.  Why would a Mancow fan be listening to us on XM?  Who the fuck would do that?  It was obviously...  Some stupid...  Some stupid traitor.  Thank you for the communique, dugout dug.  Who the fuck would do that? 
[03:31:30]  Dugout dug.  He's turning himself in.  Do they have caller ID?  No.  Doesn't matter.  No, no, but they might...  What's the phone number for the pest?  It's a different number.  Hmm.  Everyone's whispering.  Just give me a phone number.  Oh.  Who are you yelling at, Danny?  What's the phone number?  866 or 888?  What's the phone number?  Get the number.  Mancow?  Yes.  No.  No, no, no, no.  To the fucking...  To the fruit stand down the street.  We want to order Don Corleone's fruit because he shot and he dropped it in the fucking thing 
[03:32:00]  while Fredo was fumbling with his gum.  That's stupid.  Actually, we were hoping for the nearest...  It's gum.  The nearest domino.  That whole line.  He got everything out.  He got screwed up on gum.  Well, there you go.  Another pussy just like fucking Dice.  He had his chance.  Had his chance right there.  Knew that we were on the line.  That's why he hung up and went right to commercial.  Yeah, I know.  Some fucking listener blew it for us.  That just makes us work harder now.  What's the phone number?  It is 888-2-MAN-COW. 
[03:32:30]  Have fun with that number in the coming weeks.  Yes, I said weeks.  2-MAN-COW.  Go ahead.  Can you tape the calls, too?  I'd like to hear them.  Yeah, you got to tape the calls because he's going to be a pussy and just keep, you know,  hanging up on you.  We'll just show the whole world what kind of a pussy he really is.  Make sure you say, hey, man, Cal, love you.  Love your show.  Oh, they all say it.  You heard the screen.  It tells you to say it. 
[03:33:00]  How fucking embarrassing is that?  Well, you got to tell the people to tell the host that you love him and love his show.  Holy fuckaroni.  To the Radio Insider listening to the show right now, make it very clear in your article that he had a chance and decided to back out just like Dice.  You see, it's a continuation of the Dice thing.  We take on all comers, and it's not the bullshit way like this douchebag says.  If he was honest, he would have dropped what he was talking about, plunked the phone down, and talked to us. 
[03:33:30]  But he's not.  He's a phony.  He's a lying sack of shit, and he's afraid.  We're failures.  Why the fuck won't he face failures?  If you would have said, is this Opie or Anthony?  I wonder if you would have said, what?  He might be saying that to everybody.  Good.  Let him get all paranoid.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  No, he, obviously, they somehow knew.  Oh, you probably saw their phone number, too.  It's probably my stupid voice, too.  I didn't really put on much of a voice. 
[03:34:00]  No.  I put on kind of a weird voice.  Hi.  Pick up that phone.  Nyah.  Nyah.  Hello?  Nyah.  I can't hear.  My headphones are on.  It's Karnak.  Nyah.  All right, dial.  I want to see if this works.  The gunman.  Man cow.  Dial.  Okay.  What do I, what, do I got to dial a number to dial out?  No.  No, just dial that motherfucker.  Dial direct?  Yeah.  What line?  Uh.  Oh, it's, I got a dial tone.  All right, I dial.  All right, but I'm trying to find your dial tone.  And then, wait, wait, what? 
[03:34:30]  I'm trying to find the dial tone.  What?  Uh, uh, uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Oh, no.  Letters.  Hold on.  Uh.  Letters suck.  By the way, uh, Wano from Ashlyn.  You're not dialing anything.  The trailer.  I'm not dialing anything.  Wait, how do I get?  Son of a bitch.  Language.  Can I get it in?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, it's working.  All right, let's, we'll give you one more shot.  One more shot.  Yeah, of course.  Bussy. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, you know who that is.  Yeah, we certainly know.  That's our awful listeners.  By the way.  You jackass.  The traitor has been named.  Who?  Who is it?  Who is it?  Ron Bennington.  That son of a bitch.  Ron Bennington is the traitor.  I know it.  Damn, Joe.  You might want to ask him his motive later today.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe all I did was call in with an intelligent question. 
[03:35:30]  I know.  And comment.  What a, what a, what a.  Fuck.  God.  What a bad prank caller I am.  Prank caller, prank caller.  Yeah.  Hello, bowling alley.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes.  Well, I hope people enjoy your bowling alley.  All of a sudden, we're not going to see it.  What an idiot.  We're not going to see it.  You have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes.  That's fine tobacco.  Why don't you just go out and call this show as Bob of Bowie?  You're not a good, not a good pet. 
[03:36:00]  I stink.  Bob of, God, do I rot.  What happened?  I need the answer to feedback because they're very impressed with your skills.  My skills.  Holy shit.  I, you know what it is?  I'm the opposite of a pest.  I have great skills at getting in to the call, but I can't pull off the fucking thing.  The pests are good at the punchline, but 99% of them get knocked off the line because  they can't set it up like it's a real call. 
[03:36:30]  Well, he was on to us.  He knew you were on the phone, and instead of confronting us, let's make it perfectly  clear here.  Yeah.  He put you on hold.  Yeah.  Knowing that that would be the end of that.  I think the screener called me a douchebag.  Did he?  Yeah.  You didn't.  And I said, okay, love you, love your show.  Do you know what that call was like?  Well, I can give you an example here.  All right.  Let's see if Jimmy can give me a...  I'm just trying to make a point.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Jimmy's left the studio. 
[03:37:00]  He's, I think, walking into the...  Here, try the number again, Ed.  Hey, try that number again.  Oh, no redial on this thing?  Redial?  That phone's from like 1962.  Nothing?  Too visual?  Yeah.  The high-tech.  Yeah.  Bussy!  Yeah.  It's engaged.  We got someone.  The line is fucking engaged. 
[03:37:30]  We got Steve on the line here.  Steve.  Yes.  Hi.  I just want to love you, love the show.  I just wanted you to know that I disagree with your point.  Yes, Steve?  Ramone!  You do a fine radio show.  Ramone!  I enjoy listening to you.  Ramone!  You make good points.  Your fine calling skills need a lot to be desired by the phone.  I know.  Oh, I suck. 
[03:38:00]  How did I fuck that up?  I had him on the line.  At any moment, I could have gone, hey, man, Cal, it's Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you talk to us?  Why don't you confront us on the...  But, yeah, good point.  And he said, good point?  You're like, thanks.  Yeah, thank you.  It was a good point.  First time, long time.  I got all flustered because I made a good call.  I was all proud of myself.  Hey, let's go to Montana.  Jeremy in Montana, what's up?  Love you guys.  Love your show.  Thank you, Jeremy.  And that's how we want it said.  We want it said like there's a gun to your fucking temple. 
[03:38:30]  All lackluster.  Right.  That's exactly the delivery we want.  That's right.  Love you.  Love you.  Love your show.  Holding up a newspaper with the date on it.  All right, what do you got?  Just heard Tony on my damn FM radio here in Missoula.  Oh, you heard Tony from New York?  Tony from New York.  Wasn't he a good caller?  He made a good point.  Yeah. 
[03:39:00]  He just took Blue Mad Cow away.  Yeah.  And I imagine that because, you know,  a mad cow does honest and real radio.  He's completely talking about what just happened, right?  He's filling in his listeners what happened, right?  Oh, he's awful.  I was getting my tires worked on one day in a shop there in town.  Had their radio on inside the shop.  And Mad Cow was playing.  And that was right after he got fired.  And he was trying to have a tribute to 9-11 back in September last year. 
[03:39:30]  And he was going on and on about how he was the only guy on the radio that was actually even doing that.  All right.  Like, oh, my God.  Shut that crap off.  Thank you, sir.  We got a lot of people commenting about it.  Let's go to Dave.  Are they complimentary comments?  Oh, they're great.  Dave in Connecticut.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you.  I was wondering when Tony's going to call into a Howie show and do a promo bumper.  Hey, this is Anthony Cumia, and I'm listening to Howie 100. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, you want to call Howard and pray, sir?  Yeah, maybe I should.  Howard Stern, you're on.  Hi.  Great show.  Love what you're doing.  The move to satellites, it's never been better.  Your show.  Seems to be working for you.  Thank you.  Next call.  What happened?  I had him on the line.  What did I do?  When that volume change happened, you should have seen every eye just look at you like,  what did you just do?  Oh, you dropped the ball.  Dropped it.  He fucking handed it to the opponent and then blocked his own people from doing defense. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, let's go to Justin in Detroit.  What's up, guys?  Love you.  Love your show.  I missed opportunity.  I had Hitler in my crosshairs in 35.  1935.  I know.  And I sneezed.  Instead, you just put the gun down and snitched on a Jew.  You guys are so funny this morning.  I'm swerving.  And I'm trying to call a man, Cal, but I don't think we're going to ever get through again.  Nah, that's going to be a couple.  These guys are going to be busy forever, ever, ever. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, the pests are really tying that up.  I really pray to God I never get into radio because you guys will just tear me apart just  like everybody else.  Thank you, sir.  You guys are awesome.  Do you love the show?  I love the show.  Do you love us?  Yes.  Here's an interesting tidbit.  T-Bone from Jersey.  I just called.  The screener said he's not getting fired for letting O&A on the air.  So if I'm calling from the show, don't cost him his job.  So the screener is paranoid. 
[03:41:30]  The screener's all freaked out.  They probably yelled at him.  It's so funny.  It is.  You know, obviously, it would have been nice to have gotten the point across that it was  me on the phone.  Although he would have hung up instantly.  But just the fact that it wasn't even a pest that got through, I fucking got through this  screener and got onto his show must really annoy him.  Oh, boy.  Problem?  What's next?  Ah, well, the pests are chiming in.  Hey, some people are meant to do radio shows and some people are meant to be pests. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I can't wait.  From now on, you just listen to the attacks.  I can't wait to read the message boards tonight.  I'm sure they're all going to have something to say.  Oh, brother.  Supposedly, Dice is on his show right now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll call in.  Hey, I love your comedy.  Thank you.  End of call.  Click.  Stink.  I am the worst prank caller ever. 
[03:42:30]  You were just...  Well, you know what you did?  You were helpful.  I was help.  I helped.  Fucking...  Jesus.  What is wrong with me?  I don't know.  You had a great point.  You gave him a good call.  You gave him a great call.  You actually complimented me that that was a great point.  A brilliant point.  It was brilliant.  Thank God.  No one's even talking about the fact that the United States is staying out of that when  we should be involved.  Absolutely.  At Britain's bequest.  It was a brilliant point I brought up and I got all flustered because I was being complimented 
[03:43:00]  by a douchebag.  But even being complimented by a douchebag is still a compliment.  Oof.  Oh, what are you oofing?  What was that one?  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  They're awful, aren't they?  It's about time you fucked up.  Look, Ant blew it.  I'm just reading here.  It only took 12 years.  It's about time you fucked up.  On Earth 2, Anthony is king of all pests.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  I can't...  They're not supportive.  Oof.  Anthony should call Howard and compliment him for getting Sanjaya through to another round. 
[03:43:30]  Ant helped his lame show.  Oh.  Let's go to Greg in Long Island.  Greg, what's up?  Greg, how you doing?  Hi.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, Greg.  I just want to point out one little thing.  Tony also kept on topic.  Yeah.  Something that some callers don't do.  Yeah, I stayed on topic.  I had my radio turned down.  I did everything.  I was a perfect caller.  What a goody gumdrops.  And you didn't interrupt him either.  I didn't interrupt. 
[03:44:00]  I didn't have my radio up.  Keep calling the number.  We'll give him one more shot to confront us before we leave today.  Was I a perfect caller or what?  Let's go to Adam.  Oh, come on.  Ant needs to go back to sheet metal.  Go fuck yourself.  Yes, Adam?  Adam in Wisconsin.  Yeah, love you.  Love your show.  Thank you, Adam.  You bet.  I just tried to get a hold of Mancall and the screener answered.  Who are you calling for?  Opie or Anthony?  And hung up.  Oh, wow.  They're freaking over there.  See, that's real brave right there.  All brave when you're behind your stupid keyboard. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  What's the matter?  Brave in the interviews.  And then has an opportunity to face us live on the air.  It just shows how damn good we are.  On his own show, too.  It's not like we're...  Yeah.  It really does.  People are petrified.  When Dice hangs up on you, trust me, that was a compliment that day.  You know, there's a fucking fear from these people.  You could feel it.  There's a fear.  They don't want to confront this stupid show.  Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, boy.  Pussy, pussy, pussy, boy.  There is one thing. 
[03:45:00]  I try to be modest on this program.  I really do.  But there is one thing that no one can beat us at.  And that is ripping people to fucking shreds when they...  Oh, I thought you meant making good phone calls for other radio shows.  To enemies.  Well, that, too.  Now.  Jeez, I'm glad you're not McCarthy.  You would have fucking brought the Jap on the ship and said,  Look, here's what you've got to do because we're planning on bombing you.  Positive reinforcement.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  That's me.  Why not?  Help out the other shows. 
[03:45:30]  Aw.  But we can...  People know that we're...  Vicious.  Vicious when it comes to that shit.  All right, Liz.  And we have a certain wit about us that most people can't overcome.  And they're afraid to face that.  And that fucking phony will not do it.  And you know what?  We've never lost a battle.  No.  Not a one.  Man, Cal, one, Anthony, zero.  Coming in from Wilkes-Barre.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I have just two friends talking about politics. 
[03:46:00]  What's wrong with that?  Let's say hi to Liz in North Carolina.  Liz.  Liz.  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  All right, Liz.  Finally, we're going to get another update from you.  We were going to do this about two hours ago.  Liz wants rough sex from her man.  She's 5'7", 175 pounds, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Whoopi Goldberg was different.  Three kids.  She came in.  I said over the phone.  Three kids, right?  Yes.  And the husband just doesn't give it to you, right?  You want to be slapped a little bit. 
[03:46:30]  You know, you want some of that rough sex.  All right.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  All right.  Okay.  There's two.  All right.  There's a couple.  Called names, spanked.  Are you the one that was yelling, do it harder to your husband?  Do it harder?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's right there.  It's very tough to overcome.  All right.  So, your sex life has been boring in general.  We gave you a homework assignment.  How did it go?  Well, he did everything but spank me and call me in names.  What is everything besides that?  Those are the two biggies.  Exactly.  Those were the two you really wanted. 
[03:47:00]  The spanking and the, you know, the dirty words.  Maybe he went way over the top.  He, like, hogtied her and shit in her mouth and then set the bed on fire.  That's disgusting.  No, he handcuffed me to the top of the bed and he tied my ankles together.  He what?  Wait.  He handcuffed me to the headboard of the bed and tied my ankles together.  Oh, that's to make your pussy tighter because you had three kids.  No, that's because he couldn't find anything else to tie my other foot with.  It's a trick from the older days. 
[03:47:30]  But, miss, how does he have sex with you if your legs are tied together?  It was weird but very good.  I'm not exactly sure how.  Were you face down or face on your back?  Both.  He kept moving me around.  That's cool.  So he gave it to you hard, but he didn't talk through it?  No.  He was kind of tense when we first started.  Oh, there's a couple that wanted to have sex at the end of the show.  I was supposed to say yes an hour ago. 
[03:48:00]  Yes.  Oh, it might be too late now.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Liz.  He kind of felt a little tense when we first started.  Sort of like maybe he was a little nervous.  Take it all.  How was his rod?  Did it turn him on?  Oh, yes, it turned him on.  And he did what Jimmy said.  He slapped me in the face with his dick.  Good.  He did do that.  Absolutely.  He didn't take my clothes off me, though. 
[03:48:30]  He actually told me to take them off.  Wait.  So he didn't do any of the stuff we told him to do?  You took your own clothes off?  He tied your ankles together?  Yeah.  And slapped your face with his penis?  Was his penis flaccid or was it hard when he slapped your face with it?  Ring, ring.  No, it was hard.  Ring, ring, ring.  Ring, ring, ring, ring.  Ring, ring, ring.  Which?  Seven.  Eight.  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, okay. 
[03:49:00]  No, no, we're just gonna...  Now it's just...  No, it is what it is.  But.  But.  That's not good. 
[03:49:30]  One ringy dingy.  Two ringy dingys.  Two ringy dingys.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  One ringy dingy.  Oh.  Screener went home.  I got audio of Anthony.  Fire.  Mancow, what's your topic?  Hey, listen, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  Why don't we do this like gentlemen?  Why don't you get Mancow on the phone so we can talk a little bit. 
[03:50:00]  Tell Mancow to get on the phone.  If I would stand right next to him, believe me, I'd put him on the phone, but I'm in a  different location here at the network.  You can tell him.  No, you can tell him.  You've made my fucking day great.  Tell him we're on.  I can tell you that, Mike.  Why don't you tell him that we want to talk to him right now?  You have the ability.  Believe me, a phone screener can talk to the host.  Oh, absolutely.  So tell him we want to talk to him right now.  Yeah, just tell him.  About his comments to Inside Radio.  Yeah, just tell him we want to talk, and then if he doesn't want to talk, then so be  it.  But at least give him the option. 
[03:50:30]  Give him the option.  Don't you make his decisions for him?  Well, let me just tell you guys.  You've made my last half hour here a living hell.  Yeah, the pests are fine.  I appreciate all the attention and the gay comments, you know, but I really don't think  you guys are going to get to talk to him today.  Well, why not, though?  Why not?  Why not?  Because, for one thing, he's not here.  Dude.  For the second, I really don't have him here.  We're talking to a huge audience right now.  I know.  And Mankow has been...  I just talked to him.  Mankow's another pussy that just dodges people. 
[03:51:00]  He's been writing awful things about us in the press, so let's have some fun.  Let's talk it over.  Put him on the air.  Come on.  Just put him on.  Tell him we're on, and we want to talk to him.  You know, thank you guys for putting me on XM.  I really appreciate it.  Dude, what...  Ah, see.  See, this is what you deal with in radio.  Phonies.  That's it.  A bunch of phonies.  We try to even be civil.  A bunch of phonies.  That's what you get.  He's not in the same...  Where is he?  Dude, trust me.  Venus?  He's trying to save Mankow's ass now, because once again, another person who looks awful. 
[03:51:30]  Yep.  Thanks to us and our pests.  It's funny you've made my life a living hell today.  A living hell today.  Pess, you heard it.  You know, they're admitting that you're getting to him.  So, you know...  I say we keep this up every day.  Twice.  Battle speed.  Ramming speed.  Every day.  Oh, no.  What?  What?  What?  Well, I guess line one is another compliment.  Yeah, it's inbred.  Hello, inbred.  Hi, guys.  Love you.  Love your show.  Thank you. 
[03:52:00]  I just want to tell Anthony, I cannot wait to read the transcript of your upcoming court  appearance with the ex.  Yeah.  Give her whatever she wants.  That's what I say.  Bygones be bygones.  Anthony actually called her lawyer and said, look, I don't think I've been paying her enough.  You might want to file something.  I just want the court to know that I had a lovely marriage.  That was great.  That was awesome.  It's all my fault.  It's all good.  Yeah.  Oh, this is always fun.  Leo and PA. 
[03:52:30]  Go ahead, Leo.  Yes, I got to get in there and I Ramone Mad Cow.  I said, Ramone Mad Cow sucks four balls.  And he called her up your bag.  Who's Mad Cow, stupid?  Mad Cow.  See, here's the deal.  Here's the difference.  Call me whatever you want to my face.  There's nothing brave in doing it on your show when you had the opportunity to put us on  together.  Then you can call me whatever you want.  And then we'll see who actually wins that battle. 
[03:53:00]  Ugh.  All brave behind your keyboard.  This business is filled with phonies.  Thank you, Leo.  You're welcome.  Unbelievable.  All right, let's go to Reggie.  We got to get out of here.  I'm hoping there's a couple of calls, but I don't know if they're going to now.  Reggie, what's up?  Love you guys.  Love your show.  You guys are funny fuckers, man. 
[03:53:30]  I grew up listening to Mad Cow, and I didn't realize it then, but he's just such a self-righteous  prick.  He used to talk about how the FBI used to monitor everything he does and how he used to see black  helicopters flying over his condo in the Hancock building and that everybody was really worried  about what he said.  And at the same time, you'd have fat turd running around sliding on Jell-O and just as stupid  as shit.  And he's just such, he's so full of shit.  And there's also no reason why you guys shouldn't bring the traveling virus to Chicago. 
[03:54:00]  Who's the girl on the show?  He fired his like regular people that he's a chick on the show?  I honestly have no idea.  Couldn't even tell you.  I know there was a turd back in the day.  Yeah.  Ah, turd.  Hey, we got the insider from one of the radio websites listening.  Make sure in the article it says that Opie called him a pussy boy.  That's what he is.  A pussy boy for not confronting us.  That's what he is.  We called up and we were, with that call to the screen, a very civil, just asked to put 
[03:54:30]  him on the air.  Right.  It's his show too.  It wasn't like, you know, he wasn't going to get his point across to his listeners.  Hey.  Do you have a-  In fucking bumfuck Itabama.  I need, I need like, where's the other mouse?  Yeah, man, what's your knee?  Someone said that Man Cow laughed at our 50 listeners, that old gag.  Oh, stop it.  So this particular pest is saying on the answer feedback, I don't have the actual one in front  of me.  Well, now he has started something bad, because now he's insulted us.  Oh, okay.  Keep going. 
[03:55:00]  People are saying my call is what not to do during a prank call.  It's an example.  Not sure if you guys heard it.  He also said that he spoke to half of your listening audience, all 50 of them.  50 of them.  Dude, we're in fucking major markets.  Where are you?  JD from DC, he insulted the pests.  He said, all 50 of them.  We all know what happens when they're insulted.  The screener just started the all-out war. 
[03:55:30]  Hmm.  Oh, we got a Stern fan on the line.  Matt in Queensbury.  Yeah.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Matt.  Welcome aboard.  Yeah, well, don't welcome me yet.  You know, I've been listening to Stern.  You didn't say thank you.  Oh.  I've been listening to Stern for a long time.  I hate you guys.  I hate your show.  And, I mean, I'm going to tell you why.  First of all, this asshole Jim Norton, he's hilarious.  Everything he says is funny.  You know, you got Anthony with his great impressions, you know, right on the spot all the time.  Who are next?  Opie's always insulting everybody.  Good comeback.  You know, you guys suck. 
[03:56:00]  I mean, you know.  Damn.  Did I sound that good?  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you know how stupid I am?  I didn't know what he was making it.  Oh, I am as fucking...  Wow, Jimmy's ready to jump on him.  Well, listen, you.  But as he's complimenting it, I'm like, where's the thing?  He's going to say something shitty.  Where's the problem?  Oh, God, I'm a dummy.  Let's say hi to Fabio from Oceanside.  Hey, Fabio.  Love you guys.  Hi.  Love the show. 
[03:56:30]  Good evening.  New bit.  If Anthony was, and my contribution is if Anthony was a 9-11 hijacker, he would have landed  a plane safely and ahead of schedule.  You asshole.  That was really what you guys thought.  Hey, man.  That's funny.  That's really funny, man.  Okay.  Thank you for flying.  All right.  Okay.  Hope it wasn't much of a problem.  Anthony was Susan Smith.  He would have backed him into a dry dock. 
[03:57:00]  And Cotton Candy would have been waiting for all of them.  Oh, yeah.  As I drove to the psychiatric center and got help.  Let's go to Brian in Missouri.  I stink.  Fucking helpful.  Oh, Brian.  I love you guys.  And I love your show.  Now, make Steve stop raping my wife.  I said it, God damn it.  All right.  Hey, it's time for Line of the Day.  Yeah.  And if the line of the day isn't what I think it should be, it's because they didn't hear 
[03:57:30]  it.  Oh, no.  It's one of your lines?  No.  No, no, no, no.  One of my lines?  No, it was something said completely in reference to it.  It was an improv off of Mancow Show.  It was awful.  And it was really funny.  If Line of the Day, I have to say it.  All right.  Let's see if the guys are on the wall today.  Let's say hi to...  Anyone heard that but us, Jimmy?  I really got to get a laugh at that.  Let's say hi to Troy in Illinois.  Troy.  Troy.  Hi. 
[03:58:00]  Hi, Troy.  How are you guys?  Good.  Do you love the show?  Let me say this first.  I wasn't a big fan of your guys before, to tell you the truth, but I've been listening  regularly lately, and after you guys called Mancow, I figured out basically you guys have  the balls.  You're basically backing up what you're saying.  You're not phonies like you've been preaching.  And now I'm proud to say that.  I love you guys.  Love your show.  Thank you, sir.  We tried to get on his show three, maybe four times, and you saw what he did. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, I've been hearing this.  And if we sucked that bad, it would be so easy to swat us down, right?  Right.  The fact is, he's scared shitless of us today.  Oh, my God.  Is this true?  What?  There's already speculation going around that because of my stupid phone call, Opie's pushing  me off to the Ron and Fez show?  Well, yeah.  I was going to tell you after the show.  That's my awful call.  That's one show I haven't gotten into yet. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, listen to them.  They're very funny.  They're hysterical.  They're the only show I'd listen to.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I swear to God.  Let me be honest here.  Yeah, that's it.  No, I really wanted to think about it.  I used to listen to Imus when we were off the air because I was up in the morning, so  I would tune in MSNBC.  Of course, you know, I listen to Howard because you got to do your homework and make sure you  do this type of radio, right?  Because if we don't listen...  Well, that doesn't count because I'm not doing it as a form of enjoyment. 
[03:59:30]  If we didn't listen, we wouldn't know what to do every day.  Right, exactly.  So, no.  Honestly, I listened to Ron and Fez's whole show yesterday.  Really?  I just couldn't get into it.  I get into your guys this first time.  I actually caught it in the morning.  Well, there's a lot of people that call Ron and Fez and say they can't get into Opie and  Anthony.  That's why...  Those bastards.  You got two very different shows, but we share a big audience.  We certainly do.  But then you got the fringe players that don't understand us, but understand Ron and Fez,  and maybe vice versa.  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  Okay.  But we compliment each other very, very well.  Even though Ron Bennington is truly the problem.  And he ratted us out today.  Yep.  To Mancow.  Hold up Mancow and spilt the beans.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  We got a guy.  We turned him around today.  Line of the Day brought to you by BodogFight.com.  Tune in to ION TV Tuesdays and Saturdays for episodes of Bodog Fights for all the mixed  martial arts action you can want.  Check out BodogFight.com. 
[04:00:30]  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  Keep your comments clean, short and sweet, to the point, and start off by saying, Mancow,  love you, love your show.  Okay?  The screener gets runner-up line of the day, huh?  Oh, that's an embarrassment.  The screener.  You have to tell your listeners to say how great you are.  Hey, make sure you kiss Mancow's ass right off the bat.  Oh, God.  Because his ego's not like it used to be. 
[04:01:00]  And he says, like, thank you, thank you, like it was sincere.  He's just taking a page from Rush Limbaugh trying to get that whole thing going.  Good luck.  All right, here's another runner-up line of the day.  If Anthony was a 9-11 hijacker, he landed a plane safely and ahead of schedule.  Hey, I don't know if this is true.  This would be really funny.  Very good.  A caller gets runner-up line of the day.  T-Bone from Jersey.  Hey, love you guys. 
[04:01:30]  Love the show.  I got through as Guy from Compton, Illinois.  And I gave him a frunkish.  And he's like, yeah, yeah, get a life, man.  Get a life.  Why did he have to hit you so hard?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was deeply hurt.  I got to tell you.  Hey, find Jesus.  Get a life.  Jesus.  All right.  Let's say hi to Crotch Critter.  A little what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today?  Crotch Critter.  Yeah, I learned that Anthony loves man-cow. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  Unfortunately, we did learn that today.  Loves his show.  Let's go to Lauren from Kansas.  Lauren.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Especially you, sweet kids.  Thank you, mister.  Lauren?  I just wanted to tell you guys, I learned today that man-cow is even more of a pussy  than Andrew Dice Clay is.  Yeah, he wouldn't even be on the- he didn't even get to the phone to hang it up.  Exactly.  That was some fucking screener.  He's another one, too.  That was so- that was so flattering.  He had the chance to confront us, hung up, like, immediately, and then goes running to 
[04:02:30]  his MySpace account.  Like, he's like a- like a- like a 14-year-old girl.  Fucking pussies.  Come on.  You know how stupid you look?  You had the chance to confront.  You bail on that, because you know you can't handle it.  And then you go home and type something outrageous on your MySpace account.  Yeah.  Thank you, Lauren.  No problem.  See you guys. 
[04:03:00]  Let's say hi to Mike in Chicago.  Mike?  Yeah.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey.  Love your show.  You guys are hilarious.  You screwed it up.  Yeah, you screwed it up, sir.  Now, try it again this time.  Okay.  It's love you, love the show.  Oh, all right.  I'm sorry.  Especially say you love Opie.  Love Opie?  Yeah, I'm not feeling so secure about the show.  My participation lately.  So, just say that. 
[04:03:30]  It'll make me happy.  All right.  Especially love.  All right.  Love you, Opie.  See?  See?  It's a little slip up there.  They don't have time to do it.  They can't do it.  Well, I'm nice.  I make nice calls.  And I say.  All right.  Love you, love the show.  All right.  You liked the show today, Mike?  Is that what you're getting at?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You guys make me want to come to work and sit here and listen to you guys all day long.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Tom in Tennessee.  We're trying to end the show, but, you know.  I don't like the way they're saying love you, love the show.  I don't like. 
[04:04:00]  I want to hear some enthusiasm.  I don't like the lack of enthusiasm.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it should be brightening our day a little bit.  Let's try that one.  We do nothing but make their lives worth living.  I like hearing it like they got a gun to their temple.  Tom in Tennessee.  What's going on, boys?  I love you.  I love the show.  It's March 29th.  Hey, if Anthony was Scott Peterson, it would have just been another normal day of fishing.  Fishing trip with the wife.  That's right.  Let's go to Matt along. 
[04:04:30]  Matt, it only took 20 minutes for the listeners to, like, get up to speed here, by the way.  Matt, go ahead.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  I want to know if Anthony's going to give his ex-wife a double check this month or not.  Two checks.  Well, what the hell.  Well, now two by accident.  She brings up some good points after all.  Yeah, why not?  Let's go to Tony in New York.  Tony.  Love you.  Love the show.  Hey, Anthony, is your refrigerator running?  Yes, it is.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's getting warm outside.  You don't want your food to spoil.  Dick. 
[04:05:00]  Did you say dick?  Yeah, dick.  A bunch of fucking smartasses.  I love them.  Bodogfight.com gives us line of the day.  Another runner-up.  What?  Wow.  This is a record-setting line of the day.  It used to say two.  Don't make me look stupid.  What did he do?  He crossed out the two and made three runner-ups.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Picture your sister naked, Jimmy.  No.  What?  No.  Just take a look at her.  She's here today. 
[04:05:30]  No, she's not.  Say hi.  No.  Give her a hug.  I'm going to look at Sam naked.  Give her a hug.  She's right there.  Come on.  No.  Picture your sister naked.  Oh, it was all fun when you made fun of all the way May and grandma's out there.  Did you ever wake up with a breathe-right strip on her thigh?  You sisters.  Yuck.  I just missed that whole thing that happened.  I didn't hear anything. 
[04:06:00]  She's right there.  You know what's cool about this?  You can picture your girlfriend naked and your sister naked at the very same time.  No, I can't.  Look, just turn around and picture.  Nope.  The shade's down.  They're right there next to each other.  Shade's down.  Picture it.  Picture it.  Just turn around.  Look.  Sister.  Girlfriend.  Both naked.  They're kissing each other.  What do you think?  What do you think?  I'm starting to come around.  Starting to see my way, right?  You raise a good point.  All right. 
[04:06:30]  Well, thank you.  Line of the day?  Yes.  Are you sure there's not a fourth runner-up?  Why don't we just redo the show?  Scribble, scribble.  I got to piss.  Hurry.  All right.  Here's the line of the day.  Get to it.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say Chuck was probably drunk. 
[04:07:00]  The option.  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said that.  Jim Norton said that.  Because the other option is that his brains fell out.  Oh, no.  Not this.  Here's the line of the day that they missed.  Line of the day.  I don't think you were here.  No.  It was when Anthony was on hold.  And the guy said something about they chop off a baby's arms and legs and rape it. 
[04:07:30]  And something like that, right?  What did they say?  Yeah.  They chopped off a baby's arms and legs and raped them.  They chopped off a baby's arms and legs and raped them.  And Anthony went, in that order?  That was a goddamn funny line.  So I accept your thing under protest.  I like the brains falling out.  Yeah, it was cute.  But it wasn't improv while on hold waiting to attack a radio host. 
[04:08:00]  That was me on an interview.  That's another runner-up plan of the day.  What the hell?  Right there.  All right, bowdogfight.com.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  I have to make wet.  You got to make cumsy?  No, I have to make wet.  Oh, what kind of wet? 
[04:08:30]  There's a few.  I'm going to wet myself.  Standing wet or sitting wet?  I'm doing a pee-pee dance.  Do you sit when you pee?  Always.  Yeah.  Like any good girl.  I sit when I pee.  You sure?  Yeah, my dick would fall in the water.  Got a big cock.  Fucking cock.  Almost as big as Travis's.  Yeah.  You think Travis has a big one?  No.  The way he poses in some of his pictures?  I think Travis is maybe.  I think Travis barely hits five by one and a half. 
[04:09:00]  It's fucking slender and more pokish than it is thick and sexy.  I'm going to go four inches, but really like ridiculously like, you know.  Girthy.  Girthy.  That's why he goes to Canada, so he can use the metric system to make it seem bigger.  All right.  Okay.  I'm going to pee.  You guys have fun.  All right.  Closing down Pal Talk.  Bye, Pal Talk.  Thanks for all the fucking compliments today.  All right. 
[04:09:30]  Good night.  Marvin Nashville.  Yeah, man.  I just want to say, Man Cow is a bovine pussy, and you guys keep up the good work, and phenomenal.  Thank you.  Frank Cole?  Yeah.  Stop trying to prank us, sir.  Is Anthony going to apologize to the toilet after your payment? 
[04:10:00]  Well, you should always be nice to your toilet.  That was a fun segment yesterday when we had the whole joke, what's the difference between  a woman and a toilet, and Anthony said there's a lot of differences.  A toilet is porcelain, and a woman is a valid human being.  That's a good point.  I knew if we waited long enough, we would get some fine info.  Josh from South Dakota.  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show. 
[04:10:30]  That a boy.  I found Mad Cow's hidden fan website.  All about him.  www.thewillpower.org.  Check it out.  Thewillpower.org?  Oh, boy.  I think we just got pranked.  That is.  Let's take a look.  Let's take a look.  It can't.  How could that possibly be his website?  Let's say hi to Big Dick McGee.  What's up, boys?  Love the show.  Yeah.  We got his own voicemail here for the show.  It's one.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, say that again. 
[04:11:00]  All right, we have his voicemail for the show.  It's no way he can control that.  Hold on a minute.  Let us enjoy a video that's playing right now.  Jesus.  On thewillpower.org.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's what Jimmy does when he sees his sister naked.  No.  What?  He doesn't suck his own dick. 
[04:11:30]  Oh, my God.  That guy got his bed.  There's a champ.  Danny, I know you would enjoy it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  Hi, Danny.  Thanks a lot.  There's a point in his own visual gift.  The guy's going to break his neck.  You see the fucking neck muscles ready to just pop out of his fucking body.  That's a talent.  Oh, Steve, I knew you'd come running.  There you go.  That's what you get to see at thewillpower.org.  Oh, I know him.  That's Daryl.  He's going right down to the balls.  Yeah. 
[04:12:00]  Can I show your sister?  She won't mind, right?  No.  Oh, God.  No.  Was that too much?  Yeah.  Oh, look at Jimmy.  Y'all want the boys' mouth?  Don't show.  Oh, no.  No, don't.  Turn around.  She's really enjoying Jimmy.  Look.  You like thumbs up.  Yeah, she is thumbs upping the whole thing.  Jimmy's girl, thumbs up.  Yeah.  I'm getting thumbs up on both of them.  Nah.  Give it like a high five.  They're exchanging numbers right now.  Nah, I don't know.  What's that about?  Nah, I don't know.  All right.  His nose hits his bag. 
[04:12:30]  It's unbelievable.  Jesus Christ.  That guy's a champ.  Gotta send that one to my brother.  You might need a new technique.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Big Dick McGee, go ahead.  All right, man.  You want his voicemail?  Because he can't control that.  It's 1-8-7-7-Mancow-9.  Fill his shit up.  Wait.  Man-cow-9?  Wait, say that again.  Man-cow-9.  1-8-7-7-Mancow-9.  Oh, nine.  Okay.  I think Frunkus would be an appropriate message. 
[04:13:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Now I'm really through.  I'm going to fucking piss myself and take a leak all day.  Oh, you're sweet.  What happened?  Can we just have that in a loop?  Sure.  See you later.  Could you have that in a loop?  Tomorrow.  Keep it for Ronnie and Fezzy.  They'd enjoy that.  Well, Jimmy, it's me and you.  What do you want to do?  Here's a pizza.  Ooh.  That's a tinkle.  Ooh, if you leave, it's back to how it used to be.  The old days. 
[04:13:30]  Me and music.  All right.  We'll see you guys.  We're off tomorrow.  We are?  No.  Oh.  God, I got excited.  I know.  Now we're not off.  Sounds nice, didn't it?  Are you showing the people out there?  All right, hold on.  We've got to show the pal talkers.  There you go.  You think that's fake, then?  There you go.  That's so weird.  No, that ain't fake.  You can see how he's, you can't arch that body unless you're, unless you're, like, grabbing 
[04:14:00]  your thighs like that.  His privates look weird.  We're going to be scientific about that.  That's why I'm not sure I'm afraid of that.  Yeah, look, that was fake.  That's not fake.  It looks fake.  That guy got us good, though, man.  You got to be honest with that.  All right.  Let's jerk him back up and down.  Hey, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks.  It's like punch sound, woman scream, Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
