<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts engaging in crude commentary about attractive female news anchors before shifting to a discussion about smartphones, specifically the Samsung S3 and its purported eye-tracking technology, and the failed comeback of the BlackBerry 10.  A caller, Matt, confirmed a feature of the Samsung S3.  An internal conflict arose from Sal disrupting Opie's pre-show routine with a story, sparking a discussion about their pre-show antics, including E-Rock slapping Opie's newspaper and an upcoming surprise Irish-themed broadcast planned by Eric and Roland.  Sal then graphically recounted witnessing a man's leg trapped between a subway train and platform, prompting criticism from the hosts for not documenting the event.  This transitioned into a detailed critique of the rival Scott and Todd radio show, with E-Rock presenting a color-coded analysis revealing their minimal talk time, leading to reflections on the state of modern radio and their own disillusionment. The possibility of bringing baby bears from a nearby Fox News studio was briefly mentioned but discarded.

This was followed by an unplanned "Tequila and Donut Day," initiated by E-Rock, featuring copious tequila consumption by E-Rock, Roland, and a surprised Dennis from the music department, who provided impromptu music selections.  The event involved multiple tequila shots by E-Rock and humorous tangents on radio, careers, and the day's events.  Stinky, initially hesitant, also joined the drinking, and attempts to include other Sirius XM employees yielded mixed results.  The segment included a Dollar Shave Club live read by the increasingly inebriated E-Rock, discussions about St. Patrick's Day, Dennis's radio shows, and further tequila consumption.  Dave LaGreca from NFL Radio made a brief appearance.

The "Tequila and Donut Day" continued, involving many guests in a drinking contest, including Big Dave LaGreca, Rich Davis, Stinky, Roland, Eric Nagel ("The Sex Man"), and Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  E-Rock recounted humorous anecdotes from his radio career, including stories of drug use and violence in the 60s and 70s, and announced plans for four podcasts. A running gag involved E-Rock's repeated "double time checks."  Rich Voss discussed upcoming gigs, and Taylor shared a story about a confrontation with a waitress.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes was introduced and a potential trade with Sal was discussed.  E-Rock's escalating intoxication was a major focus, with Sal consistently refusing to participate.  Pepper Hicks and Sam Roberts (keeping score) also participated.  Discussions included marriage problems, radio stories, and the personalities of the guests.

The show progressed with E-Rock's inebriation becoming increasingly prominent.  He was visibly crying, leading to amusement and ribbing from Opie, Anthony, Greg Hughes, and other hosts.  E-Rock's emotional state intensified, including a discussion of his least favorite co-worker (Opie) and self-deprecating assessments.  Anthony also became intoxicated.  A call with Dr. Steve was featured, and a significant portion focused on E-Rock's emotional reactions, perceived failures, and his future. The show significantly exceeded its scheduled end time.  The post-show discussion revealed much of E-Rock's tequila was water. A listener called in, expressing their enjoyment.  Final comments and banter from the hosts concluded this segment, with a final plug for Rich Vossâ€™s appearances.


The final segment centered around the alcohol consumption, with shot counts debated. Pepper had four "cafe shots," Tay-Tay two, and Dennis three.  Mashup Nicole from Morning Mashup was a guest, along with Heather B from *Real World* Season 1, who was promoting the show's re-airing.  Sexually suggestive comments and banter occurred between the hosts and Nicole,  with Eric's intoxicated behavior a recurring theme.  Plans for a "Pizza Friday" gathering were made, with concluding comments on the guests' levels of intoxication. Justin Stengel was mentioned, likely as a joke.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  Antonio! 
[00:00:30]  It's Friday, it's Friday, it's Friday, good morning, good morning, good morning, yeah I'm all about Breanne Keeler, yeah, fuck yeah, she's CNN?  Yeah, Breanne, what's her first name, Breanne or Breanne, Breanne I think, Breanne Keeler, and they're starting to give her some more time on CNN, I'm all about her, yes. 
[00:01:00]  What have we got here?  I'm all about that fucking, this little cute thing on CNBC, it's the finance channel over there.  She looks like a cute alien.  She does, her eyes are kind of far apart, but she's got a cute face, yeah, she does, she looks like a little alien girl.  A little bit, really nice eyes, but they're a little far apart.  Yeah, yeah, there's something going on.  Gap in the teeth and a tiny chin.  It's all about, yeah, a little tiny delicate chin, she looks like she couldn't take a punch. 
[00:01:30]  I used to be into Erin Burnett until I started obsessing about her small mouth.  Really?  Yeah, man, our mouth's a little smaller, our teeth are pushed together a little bit, something's going on.  Ah.  It's very bothersome.  Here's your brother.  Oh, what's her name, Kayla?  Kayla Tausch, Tausch.  Wow, that picture makes her look even better.  Let me see.  Oh my God, she's so alien.  Yeah, that is alien looking.  If you hang with her, make sure she doesn't smile, because it just throws a lot of hurt on her face. 
[00:02:00]  There's something like, well, no, we go to the one to the far, far right.  Yeah, yeah, let me see.  She's smiling there, but there's just something very pixie about her.  She's kind of cute.  Yeah.  What's her name?  Uh, I don't know, we just said it, and I forgot.  Yeah, right.  Kayla.  Kayla Tausch, Tausch, Tausch, Tausch, maybe?  S-C-H-E thing going on at the end.  Well, we're looking at you two.  Oh, yeah, we're looking at you two.  Wait, wait, wait, go back, go back. 
[00:02:30]  Now go to the first picture.  Hmm.  Right there.  That looks good right there.  Way better.  Right there, man.  Wait, she looks like, um...  Yeah, she looks like someone.  She looks like someone that has been on our show.  Oh!  Does she have a Twitter?  I'm going to start following her.  And listeners, stop.  Don't do anything, because you're fucking ruining my chances every time.  That might not be her.  It isn't?  I don't know, that was a webpage called Hottest Women in Business News.  Well, she is a hot woman in business news. 
[00:03:00]  Kayla Tausch, okay.  All right, at Kayla Tausch.  How many followers does she have?  18,000?  That's not bad.  Or 15.  15?  Yeah, get your eyes checked.  Those fives are starting to look like.  Oh, fives look like eights.  Sixes look like eights.  Fucking eights.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I, uh...  You know, we've had a household that's been, uh, you know, sick for about two weeks.  We're all finally on the mend. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  So I've had a look at a lot of, um...  Prescription bottles?  Oh, my...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is some tiny type.  I'm starting to understand the magnifying glass.  Oh, no.  But my eyes were totally fine.  It's these stupid smartphones just staring at these things, checking your numbers.  You think that's totally destroying everybody's eyes?  Too many, uh, times a day.  You think it's destroying everyone's eyes, looking into these fucking screens?  Absolutely.  It's straining them.  It is, right?  Sometimes I wake up with a headache and I'm like, I wasn't even drinking last night. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I shouldn't have this headache.  And then you realize, oh, I was looking at a phone fucking all day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And your eyes are darting back and forth.  Whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, whish, dart, dart.  Well, with the Samsung, uh, 4, don't dart too much.  No, huh?  You hear about the Samsung 4?  It's on the front page of our paper today.  Your peepers is what I hear.  Yeah, it's gonna use the camera on the phone.  Yeah.  And then the camera will realize that you're looking at the camera, but you're not looking at the camera  because you're looking at your screen.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  And when the camera realizes, oh, you're looking at the screen, oh, we'll let you scroll a little bit.  So if you look down, it'll automatically scroll.  The camera goes, oh, okay, he's looking down, so let's scroll a little bit.  And then somehow you'll be able to start a video.  Maybe you blink like Genie or something.  I don't know.  But then if you're watching a video and then you turn your head away, the camera goes, oh, you're not looking at the screen anymore.  Let me stop this video for you.  Pretty interesting technology.  But I'm a huge Samsung guy. 
[00:05:00]  I got the S3.  I'm thinking this has got to be a bit buggy.  Oh, yeah.  You got to think the first try at it, just give me some bugs.  Yeah.  That sounds great, but I don't know.  It just seems like something that, oh, why did the video stop?  I didn't look away.  Oh, it's scrolling down and I'm not at the bottom of the page.  Yeah, something.  Like shit like that.  Right, right.  We're going to have to control your eyes.  You talk about headaches from looking at your phone too much?  Oh, man, yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:05:30]  I'm going to wait to see.  I'm going to let a few others get that one.  I'm usually the first to get the Samsung phones.  I didn't know eyeball tracking technology was this far advanced already.  It just seems like it's not quite there.  Well, they're beating Apple to the punch finally.  Because, you know, a lot of people are saying, hey, man, a lot of these features are very Apple-ish.  Right, and they're coming up with something new.  Very iPhone-ish.  So they're the first to kind of, you know, throw this technology out there.  I'm sure there'll be a thing you could just shut it off. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, probably.  Just go old school or whatever.  Yeah, go old school.  Kick it old school.  I got to tell you, though, man, that BlackBerry has taken over the...  Oh.  Oh.  What happened to the comeback kid?  What happened to Research in Motion?  The BlackBerry people, man, they were going to be the comeback kid.  Wasn't the BlackBerry 10 supposed to be like the big one that Samsung and Apple was supposed to go, ooh?  People are so passionate about their phones.  They really are.  Honestly, just dumb BlackBerry fucking jokes on Twitter.  Man, they attack you. 
[00:06:30]  Still?  Yeah.  Don't they realize that they're stupid?  It's unbelievable.  How is the BlackBerry 10 doing?  Not too good, right?  We haven't heard much about it.  Here's how you know it isn't doing well.  Whenever you're in the elevator, fucking walking around, you see people on their phones, it's not a BlackBerry 10.  It's a fucking Samsung or an iPhone.  I'm starting to see a lot more Samsungs.  Oh, there's plenty of those.  A lot of S3s out there.  Oh, hell yeah.  You should get one, man. 
[00:07:00]  You should try it out.  I like the Apple 5.  It has the Apple on it.  Give it a try.  Yeah, I know.  I don't even use, I don't have a good boy phone and a naughty boy phone anymore.  Oh.  I just have one phone.  So I'm kind of rocking the single phone thing.  And I would like to try that, but I'm so entrenched here with the Apple thing.  It's second nature to me now.  It's an extension of my hand.  Right.  I'd have to learn all new things with the Samsung. 
[00:07:30]  I haven't had one complaint with this Samsung.  Oh, I don't doubt.  You know, the S2 was still, eh.  But this S3, man.  Wow, I love it.  I'm pretty badass.  This guy's saying that you can do the stop playback when you look away on the S3 already.  What?  Yeah, you hit a button when you look away.  It stops.  It's amazing.  Do we even know?  Should we go to the guy?  Oh, it's Matt.  Matt calls from time to time.  Matt, what's up, buddy?  Colorado.  Yeah, you can go do it in the, just go down to the settings, into the motion. 
[00:08:00]  All right, maybe I don't know all the bells and whistles of this S3.  It's got bells and whistles?  Yeah, maybe I should read the manual for once.  I don't do the touchy phone thing yet.  No?  No, I can just touch phones.  Oh, there you go.  Boink.  And get shit from someone else's phone.  Yeah.  I didn't turn that thing on.  I got bump.  You just hit the two, you go bump.  Yeah.  And it works.  Yeah.  And you're good.  Transfer fucking info.  Well, we're going to pretty much start the show with Sal.  Oh, fucking Sal and Manny. 
[00:08:30]  And Sam enjoyed what happened right before the show.  Oh, because Sal's got another fucking heaping helping of get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, I didn't instigate anything.  I just chuckled at what you did.  Don't try to make it seem like I'm a bad person.  What did I do?  That was so wrong.  Well, Sal has a story to tell.  Right.  And I guess he told it to you earlier.  Well, he started off like, he goes, I know you appreciate a good story.  Oh.  And I just rolled my eyes like, I'm trying to read newspapers. 
[00:09:00]  Ah.  Should have looked at him and said, you know nothing about me.  Well, why would you start with.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Why would you start with.  I know you would appreciate.  You appreciate a good story.  I said interesting stories.  Interesting.  Not a good story.  I'm not a good storyteller by any means.  As if that's.  And as if that's like a unique thing.  Like there are people who don't like interesting things.  But you, Opie.  But you.  Why did it have to be prefaced like that?  Why wouldn't you just come and go, man, I saw some shit on the way in today. 
[00:09:30]  That's how most people would start.  Yeah.  But then.  You know, I know you appreciate an interesting story or two.  Interesting.  It's one of the unique things that make you Opie Hughes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Should I?  He's probably like coming in today thinking.  Should I tell Opie Hughes?  He appreciates an interesting story.  Finally.  It's my time.  Yeah.  But then.  I just got a routine.  I come in here and I got to read three or four newspapers within 15 minutes.  Yeah.  You don't want to be bothered.  No. 
[00:10:00]  And Mars tries to bother me.  Oh, is he in the room?  Oh, Mars.  Oh, Mars.  Sorry about that.  It is very structured here.  Once we go off book of what we're used to doing, it's like a little monkey wrench thrown  in.  I'm not saying that sometimes it doesn't help.  Right.  You know, and it's a good thing.  But, I mean, to get us off our little track that we're on, you better fucking be interesting.  My day is I try to sleep in a little more.  So the alarm goes off.  I know I have 12 minutes.  12.  Not 13.  Not 11. 
[00:10:30]  Not 15.  12 fucking minutes.  12 minutes.  Yeah.  I hear you.  To get downstairs.  I'm lucky enough to get a ride in.  Yeah.  Just because of how, where Kenny, you know, Kenny comes in from Jersey.  So he's like, he picks me up on the way in.  Sure.  That's really how that all started.  So I got 12 minutes to get downstairs.  Yep.  And then I get here.  And then I read four to, at least four papers in a half hour.  Yeah.  So then if Sal or anyone comes in, you're like, holy, I don't even have a minute to spare.  Your time is ticking and you're not doing what you normally do because Sal's fucking got 
[00:11:00]  an interesting little tidbit.  We're not just hanging around the water cooler.  Right.  You know, got into work a little early and we can just kind of hang a little bit.  It's go time.  All this time has already been allotted for.  You can't fucking find new minutes.  I feel like the time to pitch stories for the show, like something happened to me, is three  to five minutes before we go on the air.  Yeah.  That's the little talking time.  Yeah.  Because then we give ourselves maybe five minutes. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Where we're settling into our seats.  Okay.  I read the papers.  Not much in there because they're all way the fuck behind what I'm seeing on the internet.  We have time to sit.  And on my phone or whatever.  Look at some of the cute girls on the news programs.  Comment about what's going on on any of the various screens.  That is the freestyle time.  Right.  And that's where Sal might come in and relate to you a little interesting story.  But, of course, Sal is peeking down the hall waiting to see me arrive.  Oh, God.  And then he comes in here making believe it's all casual and wasn't, Opie, you're here. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  You're here at the exact same time you are every morning.  Chomping at the bit to tell you his interesting tale.  And so then, right before the show started, I go, Opie, did Sal tell you?  The story.  And Opie goes, yeah, I think we're going to start with that.  Stay close, Sal.  And Sal makes a move to kind of go sit on the couch or something.  No, he made the move.  For the chair.  Just to turn around. 
[00:12:30]  For Jimmy Norton's chair.  Oh, for the big seat.  I looked.  Yes.  I would never.  It sure looked like it.  I'm saying it.  It sure looked like you were in a spot at the big boys table.  Pull up a chair at the fucking grown-up table.  That's why I come to this, Mike.  I don't go to Jimmy's stuff.  Because then he got the big, I said stay close, not stay in here.  Oh, it's so embarrassing.  Yeah, Opie gives him that.  I said stay close, not stay in here.  And then, of course, you hear Sam just go, ah.  Because it was hilarious because it wasn't a joke. 
[00:13:00]  No, it wasn't.  It was pretty much.  No, because he's not part of the weird environment right before the show.  No.  Because then I know he's going to be all nervous and he's going to have to try to say something.  Sam comes in.  Travis comes in.  And that's like the dynamic.  Yeah, I'm used to Travis in here, Sam in here.  Sal would be like, why is Sal in here?  Yeah, it's awkward.  Yeah, awkward.  And every time he opens his mouth, he's like pitching.  He's not just hanging.  It's always something that's self-serving for Sal.  Sal never comes in here completely selfless and just like, hey, you know, this is what's going on. 
[00:13:30]  It's always, how can I advance myself?  How will people like me more if I say this?  It's too bad it's not working, but I mean, it's a good skill to have.  Unfortunately, he does not have that skill.  No, he's not very good at it.  But then E-Rock gave me some weird fucking, why did you slap me across the chest today?  What?  What is that about?  E-Rock comments.  That was his good morning today. 
[00:14:00]  I hit your paper.  I didn't even touch you.  No, it ended up hitting me.  I'm suing you.  Why would you hit anything?  It was weird.  It was like he came in with a, hey, good morning, but he like kind of slapped toward my paper.  Very aggressive.  I didn't even touch it.  But what was that about?  That was weird, too.  That was, that's, anything out of the routine, I don't like.  That's aggressive right there.  That's some kind of.  I don't think it was aggressive.  Dude.  He's excited because he worked on something that.  He worked on something.  Yeah, that could be pretty good today. 
[00:14:30]  Whoa.  So I think he was feeling a little excitement.  So he's like, hey.  Just something different.  He's slapping me something different.  I don't think it's that different.  He's also, he's loose today because today's a theme day.  What do you mean it's a theme day?  Eric has created a theme for today.  I don't know.  That's what I was talking about.  Eric, did you create a theme today?  What a bunch of surprises today.  Yeah, Roland and I created a theme.  Roland.  For real?  Yeah, it was mine, and then Roland jumped in on it, too.  So it's both of us now.  So when are we going to find out about that? 
[00:15:00]  When do we get to eat it?  I'm sure it's food related.  I'm sure it's going to show up.  We're the ones that are surprised.  We're surprised now.  Our names are on the wall.  It's a Friday.  We figured we'd surprise you.  What kind of theme, though?  Some kind of Irish theme?  I guess we could apply it to that.  I hate corned beef, so don't fuck me.  I want Irish music all day long today, so that we're doing.  All right.  We're doing fucking Irish. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, when Irish boys are simboiling, makes me turn a shade of green.  Oh, God.  No, man.  I want more of that.  I'm going back to Boston.  Ah!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm totally doing to a totally do song. 
[00:16:00]  Nice.  Crazy.  Get a little, you're the little.  Grabbing my shillelagh and jacking.  Sounds like Popeye.  We need some Salvi fucking Irish music today, though.  Oh, that fucking...  All that shit.  Flogging Molly.  All that shit.  Right in your fucking face.  Give me one to start.  Do you have one?  I don't have them yet.  Oh, E-Rock.  Some of that aggressive Irish music.  That knows you're about to see a really good movie. 
[00:16:30]  Good movie with, like, fucking guns.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Renegades.  We kind of figured that out.  Yeah, they did.  So, Sal, what happened to you on the way in today?  So, I was taking the train in and, uh...  Yawn!  Jeez!  You gotta get through it, Sal.  You gotta get through it.  Fight your way through.  So, we're waiting.  We're waiting at the train.  It just stopped at 42nd for a while.  We?  Really? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Who are you coming in with?  Uh-oh.  A lady?  What?  Is it a lady?  No.  Well, we're waiting.  So, um...  We're stopped at 42nd for, like, a solid 10 minutes.  I take my headphones out.  And I hear, like, a lot of commotion going on.  Holy shit.  And this lady...  This is an incredible story.  So, wait, what's the way was it?  This is 42nd, Brian Park. 
[00:17:30]  42nd?  And what?  And Brian Park.  Sure, right there.  Oh, see, I thought...  You're pretty close to here.  Not Brian Park.  No.  Brian Park.  Brian Park.  So, uh...  Get that right.  I start walking, you know, the lady comes over to the PA.  She's like, oh, the train's out of service.  I'm like, we were just on this shit.  Why the fuck is that out of service?  I start walking out, and there's a huge crowd of people, and there's cops surrounding,  like, one of the entryways to get on the train.  Uh-oh.  I look over, and there's this guy, completely motionless, and he's pinned from, like, the top 
[00:18:00]  of his inseam, like, uh, like his crotch area.  Thigh.  Thigh, yeah.  Upper thigh.  Uh, and he's laying down half in the train, half out of the train, and he's completely  motionless.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, he's in the train?  In the train?  Yeah, he's like, let's say this is the, that flange that sticks out.  He's like, kinda, like, I don't know how to describe it.  Like, the...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The platform?  Yeah, the platform.  Is he between the train and the platform?  Yes.  Oh, you said in the train, like his foot is in the door.  His main body is laying in the train, but his leg is in between that. 
[00:18:30]  Wait, he's actually in the train?  Yeah.  He's laying in the train.  I thought, when you told me this, this is, uh, uh, the basic story that we've, you know,  hear happens from time to time, but this is even more unusual.  So, wait, he was on the train, you think?  Yeah, he was like, imagine like you were just standing...  All right, now I'm freaked out.  How did it happen?  I have no idea.  He, he seemed like, like a homeless dude, like he had like gross dreads and all that  sort of stuff.  Cops were shooing everybody away, firemen were coming down. 
[00:19:00]  He was on the train, and now he's got a leg in between the train and the platform.  But if somehow the door was open, and he had his leg hanging out before they reached  the platform, and then it, it hit like...  Yeah, but those doors don't really open.  They don't open before, and I couldn't figure it out.  And he, he was, uh, you could see like how, how much pressure was on his leg.  What, it was all squished?  Because you could see it was like really, really indented on the inside.  It was absolutely disgusting.  That leg's gone.  Yeah, and, um...  He was still trapped between the train and the platform? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, he was still there when I left.  They're gonna have to saw his leg off right there.  It was, it was really gross.  You know that.  Yeah, and...  A lot of times you get stuck, what, above the, uh, belly button kinda, and those people  die.  There's nothing they could do for them.  Yeah.  But this guy, they might, somebody might have to go down there and just saw his leg off  to save his life.  Yeah, it was absolutely disgusting.  And firemen were coming down, and as the cops were coming down, you could see they had  this sort of like look in their eyes.  It was like, I don't know, it's hard to describe it, like they could see like some shit was  about to go down.  Wow.  Pretty nasty. 
[00:20:00]  In the train.  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  Like, okay, here's, here's the flange that sticks out.  This is the train.  Here's the platform.  He's like this.  He's stuck this deep.  So one of his, his left leg is up on the platform.  His left leg is fine.  His left leg is in the train.  How do you know he was in the train, though?  It might have, he might have gotten squished.  Right.  And then they opened the door.  And then they opened the door, and he just fell in.  Or, all right, yeah, and then he's trying to get himself comfortable in some weird way.  Yeah, that's, that makes more sense. 
[00:20:30]  Than him being on the train.  Yeah, because I'm thinking this happened to someone that was on the train, which is fucking  fucking frightening.  No, that's crazy.  Yeah, okay.  That's crazy.  I think it went, Anthony.  He got caught, and then when they opened the door, he had some room to kind of maybe flop  and wiggle.  Yeah, so women were like screaming and shit.  It was kind of, that was like.  Oh, them bitches.  So, uh, you're going to post a video, or?  I didn't, I didn't take any photos.  You're going to post the pictures?  The cops are shooing us all around.  You're going to post them on Instagram, or?  Well, I have a picture with everyone having a camera.  Yeah, I know.  I guess they.  But why wouldn't you just take a picture of, like, the commotion, even?  Yeah, I just wanted to get here early. 
[00:21:00]  That's why.  So you think it's going to make the news?  You're not in the media business or anything, you know.  I don't know.  You're going to make the news?  It might make the news.  It happened.  It's not going to make the news, because they don't have a picture of it, because you decided it wasn't  important enough to take a picture of.  I wanted to get here early so I could make sure that I could tell you the story with  no photos or video.  Yeah.  Story's useless without pics.  I know.  Well, I'll take one next time I see some shit.  Yeah.  But, uh, yeah, it happened, like, ten after five, so maybe, maybe it might hit the news 
[00:21:30]  soon.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's, uh...  Crazy-ass shit.  That is pretty fucked up.  Why wouldn't you take a picture?  I don't know.  I just didn't want to take one.  And the cops were shooting us away, so I was like, I wasn't going to take out my phone  while the cops were saying, leave.  Well, you do the make-believe leave.  Everyone knows how to do this shit.  The cop goes, eh, eh, eh, eh.  You go, oh, okay.  And then you start walking away, so he turns to go, eh, to other people, and that's when you  turn and snap. 
[00:22:00]  The make-believe.  There's a leave and a make-believe.  Right.  Right?  Yeah.  And then you pull your camera out.  You go, what do you got, an iPhone?  Yeah.  So you hit that button twice, fucking slide the camera up.  You don't even got to fucking go through your little code, and you just start taking it  as you're leaving.  And I'm pretty sure they're not going to arrest you.  They probably are dealing with bigger issues, like, for instance...  Yeah, how to fucking solve this guy's leg off.  Yeah, correct.  This guy's femoral artery ready to go off like a fire hose.  You think he could survive that? 
[00:22:30]  I guess if they could quell the bleeding quick enough, but...  You think they could even try?  I don't know.  I mean, they need that train for rush hour.  I think they actually have something that they...  Time's up the essence right now.  There's something they put between the train and the platform.  Some kind of pneumatic thing or something, and they actually push the fucking train over  a little bit.  Oh, really?  And pull them out, yeah.  Oh, old school.  You had no chance.  Yeah, yeah.  No chance.  Yeah, I think they push it over now a little bit with some pneumatic. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  And they could kind of make a little more room to pull the fucking leg out.  Yeah, all right.  Once I got street level, there was probably, like, four fire engines there.  There was, like, three ambulances.  Well, that would be a cool picture for Instagram.  Yeah, did you at least get the fire engines?  Oh, yeah.  What does it look like?  Oh, boy.  I checked.  I checked.  You do realize you're in the media business, right?  Jesus.  I know.  You're the worst.  You do realize.  You got a camera on you.  What do you use it for? 
[00:23:30]  Right.  What do you use it for?  No, there's no...  Where are his Instagram pics?  Why wouldn't you...  My first thought would be...  That's a good one.  I got to get a picture of this or something.  Yeah.  I got to document the scene.  Right.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, wow.  At least you got that.  He's got a picture of drums.  Yep.  Oh.  And a seat.  And a seat.  No one in the seat.  That was a wine bottle.  That's good.  All right.  Action-packed.  That was a Hendrix.  Yeah, that's gin.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  That's my stash.  Who's the girl you didn't give a fuck about? 
[00:24:00]  That was the old singer of my old band.  Why don't you have her in the picture, really?  That was the joke, is that she's really, really short.  Oh.  Oh, that's pretty...  It's not funny.  It's kind of funny.  Oh, boy.  Hey.  It's a good story.  It's just, I don't know why you wouldn't try to document it.  Sam, would you pull out your camera and try to do something?  Yeah.  I mean, I would want, especially, you know, in 2013, you pull out your camera just to 
[00:24:30]  get something.  Right.  Everyone's got a camera.  Come on, man.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of a no-brainer.  Like, it's almost second nature at this point.  Yeah.  That, like, at first you go, holy shit, and then you go, oh.  Oh, camera.  This is why people carry cameras on them at all times now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it would probably be even a better picture from a distance.  And plus, you know you're going to go tell the story on the air.  Right.  Like, immediately I'd be thinking, wow, I'm going to tell the story on the air.  Of course.  You're going to want to direct people, and then you get a little Twitter plug-in, and  you go, hey, check out Not Sam on Twitter, and the picture's there. 
[00:25:00]  You motherfucker.  No, it's like a hypothetical.  Oh, okay.  That's not really your handle?  No, yeah.  No, no.  It is.  Oh, it is.  Coincidentally.  Oh, okay.  But you needed that for the example?  For the example.  Gotcha.  Exactly.  All right.  I got a little confused there.  Yeah.  Hope your radio got very confused by that one.  Sal just pays attention to rules.  What does that mean?  They tell him to leave.  He fucking leaves.  That's it.  He's taking pictures at concerts and stuff.  What concert is that?  That's his band.  They're called Harvard. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, I love them.  You don't know them.  I so know them.  No, you don't.  E-Rock, play my favorite Harvard song, please.  E-Rock.  Yeah, Eric.  Pull it up, dude.  Put him on the spot.  That's great.  E-Rock.  Play my favorite.  For E-Rock.  Let's just get stupid today.  Oh, man.  Too late.  Yeah.  This one's cool, right?  This one's good.  Yeah, I put this in the system.  Yeah, they usually play this late in the set, but who knows? 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  Like this.  I'm so behind on music.  It's embarrassing.  I always took pride in the fact that I was keeping up with it, but not so much these days.  It finally fell off.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I'm going to try to get back into it.  I got to get my...  I don't even have satellite radio in my house, and I don't have our show in my car.  No?  No, I just fucking...  I don't have all that shit.  You got to get a Sonos system. 
[00:26:30]  You got to get that.  I don't want to listen to the show when I'm not here, because I want to try to get away  from it a bit.  Well, you should have satellite, though.  I know.  Sonos rules.  You have like that.  You have Rhapsody.  You have fucking Pandora.  Everything on one system, and you just fucking pick it.  Or you could just play whatever's on your phone, too.  Like now, I got fucking Sonos.  I hit the thing, and one of the options is your iPhone.  Nice.  And I'm like, boom, and I play all the music on my phone all over my house.  I got to get all that set up again.  Love it.  Well, the problem is, you work for this company, and they still turn off your radios. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, I know.  And I think they used to turn them off every six months, because, you know, it's one of  the perks.  We get free subscriptions.  Yep.  But they want to make sure the free subscriptions are being used, so they turn off all the free  subscriptions.  Every so often.  And then you have to go, hey, man, I'm still listening to that.  So I finally gave up, because I'm so sick of my radios going off every...  It seems like it goes off every month now, at this point.  You know who gets better treatment than me?  My brother.  Really?  Yeah.  He's got a number, let's just say, that he calls when his satellite isn't working, 
[00:27:30]  let's say.  Nice.  And then all of a sudden, it's working.  What's the number?  For another couple of years.  What number is it?  It's a special number.  Your number?  No, not my number.  I can't do shit.  He knows that much.  He knows not to call me.  Oh, he bypasses you.  Oh, he bypasses me, bypasses customer service, bypasses everything, and has a certain number.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can you write it down at least?  Here's the initials. 
[00:28:00]  Here's the initials.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  You didn't get that?  No.  Did you get the initials?  Not really.  Okay.  Here's the first one.  Are you running backwards?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah?  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Uh-huh.  He got that number.  And boy, is he happy to just...  Nice.  ...help Joe out.  I got to make some, uh...  Not even calls. 
[00:28:30]  I don't call people.  I'm going to text some people and get my radios turned back on.  I just go, Keith!  Keith takes care of it.  So Sal's story ate up about five minutes.  That was pretty cool.  That was, uh...  Yeah, you'd think...  You'd think we're going to take out a little more.  Whoa.  Sal's a cunt.  Oh.  To the NBC, uh...  No, it's infuriating.  What?  He...  That could be the story of the day, and it's just a throwaway now, because he doesn't  have pictures, but you knew...  He obeys the law, which is silly.  Yeah. 
[00:29:00]  I mean, no offense, but I mean, when they're shooing you away, you don't just go, oh, okay.  You leave that guy, and you go over here.  Yeah.  So you could get your pictures.  That story...  Or take in more of the scene, like...  Right.  He saw this amazing scene, and then he quickly left, so he doesn't have many details.  He'd be a terrible photojournalist.  Oh, where's the picture, Sal?  Oh, I forgot it.  I would be...  I would be late for the show.  I'd call in, and I'm like, eh, man, I'm down here in the subway. 
[00:29:30]  I'm waiting for them to saw this guy's leg off.  I hope you don't mind, but I think I'm going to have a pretty good story when I get in today.  Yeah.  Right.  E-Rock did that, and that was for a branch in his driveway.  You guys got to see this branch.  Sal's no fucking Peter Parker.  No.  He's Peter Pumper.  Because he's gay.  It's a very powerful story in another man's hands.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But in Sal's hands.  Yeah.  So, E-Rock, you plan a day today, but we have to wait for rolling?  So if we're waiting for rolling, it involves food. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Well, and other things.  I'm not a big fan of Irish food.  I'm a fan of the Irish people.  You don't like corn, beef, and cabbage?  I've tried that a lot over the years.  I don't mind it once a year.  There's a reason it's served once a year.  Yeah.  If it was that good, it would be on a lot more menus.  That's true.  Instead of the special Irish menu, where the restaurant turns everything green.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They turn their menu green, and then, you know, they have the special corned beef.  By my city apartment, there's a place opened up almost a year ago. 
[00:30:30]  It's called McHale's.  Yeah.  It's an Irish place.  It's very nice.  I'm able to go in there, enjoy some Guinness and stuff.  But they got, like, an Irish menu, but it's kind of good stuff.  You know, the bangers and mash and fucking shit like that.  And they got corned beef and cabbage, but I haven't gotten that one.  But, yeah, it's fucking...  I don't mind it in an Irish restaurant like that for some reason, but...  Tastes better, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They know what they're doing, I guess.  Try to make that shit at home and it never comes out right. 
[00:31:00]  No.  So.  No.  Mike Hell.  Corned beef and pastramo you don't like?  Yeah.  Corned beef and pastrami?  Yeah.  Isn't that, like, the same thing?  What?  I think it is.  Right?  It's too different.  I like the cabbage-y part.  I don't mind the cabbage-y part.  Oh, I don't like cabbage.  Just with the corned beef, you know, a little forkful.  Chunk-kunk, chunk-kunk.  You get both of them.  Not bad.  And a lot of people think I'm Irish.  I'm not. 
[00:31:30]  What?  Nope.  Greg Hughes is not Irish.  I have a drop.  Yeah?  We call it a drop.  One drop rule.  Oh, that doesn't work for Irish?  I got a grandpa that's from Canada, so whatever the fuck that is.  French-Canadian?  Yeah, I never remember.  He was a loser.  Newfie?  Most of that generation, they were a bunch of losers.  Fucking idiots.  Why would you settle in Canada when America's right there?  No, he came down.  What?  Yeah.  I guess he came down.  I think he's from, I think, that's my mom's side of the family. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know shit about my mom's side of the family, but that's what I assume.  I think he was from Canada.  Yeah?  I don't know anyone on that side of the family.  I have an aunt I haven't seen since I was 12.  My mom's sister I haven't seen since I was 12 or 13.  You have a very unique family dynamic at times.  It's bizarre because she lives somewhere in Flushing or Astoria.  That's, what, 10 miles from here?  Yeah.  I live about 10 miles away from my mom's sister, and I haven't seen her since I was a kid.  Astoria! 
[00:32:30]  Oh, shut up.  Yeah.  Yeah, I haven't seen her.  But then my dad's side of the family is all in.  We're all, you know, it's like a normal fucking family thing.  You got your ups and downs and all arounds, but we all know each other and we get together  and this and that.  That's nice.  Mom's side of the family, not so much.  Hmm.  Do you not get along with them or just not see them?  I don't know.  Oh.  I don't even know their names.  It's been that long.  No.  Wow.  I should throw my mom's sister's name out there. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah?  See if you got a bite?  Nah, I don't care.  Supposedly, if you call her, she's cool.  Yeah?  Yeah, my sister called for some school project for her daughter.  Uh-huh.  They had to learn about, I got some Polish in me, so, I don't know, I guess she was  doing a book report on Poland, so my sister called her.  Really?  She was incredibly nice, like, you know, she never went away and answered all the questions  and my sister was like, all right, thank you, and hung up.  So why didn't she keep what kind of a relationship? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  I have no idea, because that side of the family is batshit crazy.  Well, you'll get that.  I think she was paranoid that my mom was, you know, going to get all the money when  the mom died there, so she was, like, in uber protection mode.  She wanted it all.  Not that there was a fortune there, but there were a couple Hummels, that's it, and a small  brick house in Queens somewhere, that's it.  When you have two sides of the family that you kind of know, one is always going to be  a little crazier than the other, so it makes them seem real crazy, because the other side 
[00:34:00]  seems very sane in respect to the other one.  So, I don't know, I always thought my father's side of the family was a lot more fun as a  kid than my mother's side of the family.  Oh, God, really?  Yeah, because my father's side of the family were fucking just drunks.  It was great.  As kids, that's fun.  They were all fucking irresponsible and fun and everything, and my mother's side of the  family seemed a lot more, you know, into working and getting things done and shit like 
[00:34:30]  that.  What kid likes that?  Now, it's been reversed, like, I don't know many of my father's side of the family  people anymore, a lot of them are dead, I guess, but the few I do know, I see, not very  often, but enough, and we have a great time when we hang out, but now my mom's side of  the family, they are the shit, you know, Uncle Tony and our friend, all the cousins and  everything, and they're fantastic, I'm going to be seeing them for Easter, which is, you  know, always a time.  Perfect.  I love that. 
[00:35:00]  Perfect.  Yeah, I've always gotten along very well with, like, I don't recall, if I can recall anybody  that I hated from my family, where it's like, cut them off, I don't want to talk to them  anymore.  My family has a very weird, like, and I know that's out of the ordinary.  But my mom's side, I didn't hate anyone, because I didn't know any of them.  I didn't know.  I mean, the one thing my mom did, you know, she, her mom was way crazier than my mom ever  was.  And my mom realized that early on, you know, she has six kids with my dad, and she realized 
[00:35:30]  to have this woman in her life would be really bad for her kids.  So she pretty much, you know, pushed her mom out.  Right.  Because she didn't want her around us.  You didn't want her affecting the kids.  Oh, I remember, I've said it a few times on the radio, but when my mom's mom, I don't  even call her my grandma.  She was never a grandma.  The Precious?  Yeah, yeah.  Precious.  My mom's mom would come over, and I remember we all would kind of, like, go upstairs and 
[00:36:00]  kind of hide and avoid her.  Yeah, we just knew.  Yeah, she was intense.  And the fave Miss Precious thing?  Yeah, of course.  I was, like, 20-something when I went about 10 to, I don't know, 10, 12 years without seeing  my mom's mom, and she was dying in a hospital.  The famous Precious story that I've told a few times.  Well, my mom's sister was there, but I never saw her, because she left the room when she  knew we were coming, or saw us coming, and was peeking around the corner, hiding, and  waiting for us to leave. 
[00:36:30]  So supposedly she was there that famous day when I told my mom.  Only gotten a glimpse of you anyway, because you went back out to the car.  Yeah, the story goes, the short version, my mom's mom looked at me and went, oh, Precious?  Precious?  Because I guess she called me Precious as a kid or a baby.  And she goes, oh, you've gotten so big.  I'm like, big?  I'm out of college now.  She'd dress like the Grim Reaper and skulk in the room.  So I was trying to be cool for my mom, but I did look at my mom and said, Mom, I'll do  what you got to do. 
[00:37:00]  I'll be outside in the car, and I just walked out on her.  That was the last time I saw her.  Yeah.  But I had no connection to her.  No.  What the fuck?  No.  Of course not.  Fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck that shit.  Well, I don't know how we got there from Sal's thrilling story.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Comment.  Yeah.  When are we going to do the other thing that you prepared for the show?  Whenever you want to do it.  You want to do it now?  If you want.  I'll bring the printout in.  Hang on. 
[00:37:30]  Ooh.  Should we?  I don't know.  Shall we?  Surely.  It was interesting reading, to be honest with you, because we do pay attention to some  of these other radio shows.  Not so much as we used to.  No.  It used to be a battle.  Battle royal.  And we're obsessed with Scott and Todd.  Who isn't?  These guys make so much fucking money.  It's disgusting.  And they don't even really have to do anything anymore.  Right, E-Rock?  I didn't hear what you said. 
[00:38:00]  They make a shitload of money, right?  About two to four million.  What?  Each?  What do you mean about two to four?  That's like double.  Scott makes more?  A little over four.  How do you know this stuff?  I got cash in my bank.  He's fucking rich.  Really?  This guy makes $4 million a year?  Yeah, because he's got the morning show.  He's got an oldies channel that he syndicates.  And he's the VP.  Four podcasts, I hear?  The VP of programming for Citadel.  God damn.  Citadel.  Oh, we used to work for Citadel, didn't we? 
[00:38:30]  That's Fareed's place, right?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm kidding.  That was the verdict.  It transferred over.  It's cumulus now.  I'm sorry.  Thanks to Citadel, we lost 100 Gs.  $100,000 down the shitter because of that fucking guy.  That was my big investment.  That was going to be the one, right?  That was going to be the one.  That was going to be the one where we go, tell the grandkids, let me tell you about how  I made my millions.  I swear to you, I thought I was going to turn 100 Gs into a mill.  Of course.  Our 100 Gs is worth zero. 
[00:39:00]  Baby bears on Fox News.  I can't even.  Can we bring them over here?  I can't even deal.  They are adorable.  Go get the baby bears right now.  We get the Fox people.  They're right across the street.  We had that country singer the other day outside our studio.  Why can't we have the baby bears outside our studio?  Who's this guy?  Urban Tarzan?  I don't know.  Let's get him.  Let's get the word out.  He looks like Fabio with animals in his hand.  Look at those little bears.  Yeah, let's do this.  Oh, my God.  What's he coming back with?  Is he coming back with something? 
[00:39:30]  Oh, look at the girl's got a bear.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  He's got a baboon.  Oh, wow.  It's a baboon.  Look at his little face.  I love a baboon.  You know, these segments on TV are hacked, but I watch every time.  Because animals are adorable.  Every fucking time I got to watch.  I love animals.  Every show has done the animal segment, but I'll watch every single one of them.  Like Jack Hanna on Letterman for 30 years.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, but he brings out shit you've never seen before.  Oh, look at the baboon. 
[00:40:00]  So, E-Rock took it upon himself to do a Scott and Todd show rundown.  Whoa.  What the hell is this?  What are we looking at?  This is an estimated rundown of their show.  I did three different shows from three different weeks, and the show format pretty much is almost exactly the same as far as what they do and the time.  Oh, my God.  I was amazed when I saw this.  So, the first segment, like we've just talked, we just talked for, I don't know, about 45 minutes so far, right? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Their first segment.  Well, segment is in between, this is the first page you have there is the first hour of their show.  But a segment is in between songs and commercial breaks.  So, it's what they actually do on the air before they go to a song or go to commercial.  So, in the first hour of their show, they have to break four times?  They break four times in that hour.  And these people bitch if we go a little long in commercials between segments? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  And by break, it's either a music break or actually going to traffic commercials.  So, their first segment, they talk a total of one minute and 35 seconds?  Yes.  Then the second segment, they allot themselves a little more time and they talk for four minutes and 50 seconds, Ant.  Four minutes and 50 seconds for that second segment.  Yeah.  And that includes, what, traffic? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, yeah.  Does that include them talking?  What are they talking about?  Like, give me an example of what they actually talked about in that second segment for 450.  Let me see the page real quick.  The second segment.  All right.  So, yeah.  Every time they come back, they're usually always doing a time and weather update for you.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Then, once an hour, they talk about their plugging the TV show that they do.  Right.  And then, they either go to what they call showbiz news entertainment or they talk about the headlines that are in the newspaper. 
[00:42:00]  All right.  So, they talked for four minutes and 50 seconds there.  Yeah.  Because, in the second segment here, they came out of music, did time and weather for 20 seconds, talked about the TV show for 30 seconds.  Then, every hour, they do showbiz on the 10s where the news entertainment girl tells them all the entertainment headlines and then they discuss that.  Right.  How do we get this gig? 
[00:42:30]  And then, once...  Might be time to pull back a little bit.  Pull the reins back?  A little bit.  Play some music, get a fucking news girl in here, some traffic.  Traffic, yeah, filler.  Yeah.  And then, it's called filler, like E-Rock.  Some good filler here.  And when they think they're done, they hit the stinger and go right to traffic and to the break.  Right.  So, in that second segment, they talked for a total of four minutes, 50 seconds.  Man.  And then, they do traffic and commercials, which is about nine minutes. 
[00:43:00]  Then, after the commercials, they do two songs in a row.  Man.  Which is about seven minutes, 45 seconds.  So, they go 17 minutes without even talking.  They come back again, do a weather update.  Right.  And then, they talk...  Something you get on your phone.  No one pays attention to a weather forecast.  No.  And this will be the third segment in the first hour.  Right.  Why would I listen to a weather forecast of this, like, vague area, when I could get a weather forecast for exactly where I'm standing?  Right.  On your phone. 
[00:43:30]  Why would you listen to someone and go, all right, and here's what the weather's going to be?  It's like, not really.  Well, I see.  I mean, E-Rock broke down the first hour here.  They do weather every segment.  So, they're doing weather basically four times an hour.  Four times an hour.  I could see maybe a quick little, hey, here's the weather for today.  So stupid.  If you need to know more, obviously, you know, check the app on your phone.  Terrible.  E-Rock has paperwork.  E-Rock gave us paperwork.  And there's colors on it.  Well, wait till you see.  There's colors.  That second page is going to infuriate you. 
[00:44:00]  Don't go to it yet.  Don't go to it yet.  Be surprised.  Oh, surprise.  Whoa, don't turn the page, Anthony.  E-Rock, I already looked.  Oh, no.  I saw the totals.  The totals are hilarious.  How mad are you?  It's amazing.  Yeah, we don't have to, like, go into detail.  So then the third segment of the first hour, they get to talk a little longer.  Seven hours and...  Seven minutes.  Seven minutes and 40 seconds, but there's news and weather type shit in there.  And then they finish up their first hour by talking for five minutes and 30 seconds.  In the fourth segment, yes.  In the fourth segment. 
[00:44:30]  Four segments.  In the first hour.  Yeah.  And that was about five minutes and 30 seconds.  So, to recap, the first hour...  Yeah.  They played five songs, which was 18 minutes and 35 seconds.  They did traffic and commercials, which was 23 minutes.  They've talked that first hour for a total of 19 minutes and 35 seconds, leaving 42 minutes and 35 seconds that they said nothing or did anything. 
[00:45:00]  Your numbers don't add up.  No, because it's going from legal ID to legal ID.  So, sometimes the legal ID is, you know, within two minutes of the hour.  Because 42 and 35 and 19 and 35, that's like, that's an hour or two, basically.  Well, these numbers are pretty sweet, Iraq.  Oh, they're right there every hour that they talk.  So, they only talk, the first hour, they talked 19 minutes and 35 seconds. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  And then the second hour, they talked for 18 hours and 53 seconds.  18 minutes, 53 seconds, yeah.  I keep saying hours.  Hours, yeah.  Jesus, what's wrong with me?  18 minutes and 53 seconds.  Because that's what it feels like when we talk.  You're right.  Third hour of their show, they talked for just under 18 minutes.  Yep.  And then their fourth hour, they call it in and they go on cruise control,  because they only talked for 11 minutes in the fourth hour.  And their show always seems to end about 9.48, 9.49 in the morning.  Could we talk 11 minutes for the last hour of today's show? 
[00:46:00]  Let's just talk 11 minutes.  Yeah, no one's around, right?  We can play a lot of music.  Let's do an experiment.  So, on an average day, the Scott and Todd show talks just over an hour.  An hour and seven minutes, 35 seconds.  We're going to do that in the first segment.  Yeah.  Two to four million.  Two to four million for that.  You all right, sir?  That's amazing.  Yeah.  Sam, how'd that go?  What do you mean, how did it go? 
[00:46:30]  Is this segment going to make best of Saturday?  That's E-Roc's call.  I'm sure it will.  Anything E-Roccy puts on, do you think?  Charts.  Fucking graphs.  Graphs.  It's a lot of work.  It is a lot of work.  I just wanted you to see that.  Spending a lot of money on those guys.  I guess they're just paying for their names at this point, right?  Of course.  I think that's what happens in the business.  Yeah, I mean...  An audience gets comfortable with names or a show, and then they just pay for the actual  names and don't care if the content is not happening anymore. 
[00:47:00]  They rock.  If it ever was.  I don't even know if they...  I don't have one Scott and Todd highlight where I could go, well, they at least did this.  I have no idea.  It's exactly the same as the Mike Francesa thing we talked about yesterday.  People are...  They hear the phone scam.  They hear Todd doing the funny Todd voice.  Right.  And they just laugh and feel comfortable, because that's what their morning is supposed to include.  Right.  They don't have any idea what he said.  Right.  Like, nothing penetrates their ears. 
[00:47:30]  It's just the sound of the voice.  You don't think when people get to work, they go, oh, man, did you hear Scott and Todd today?  And then they discuss a specific topic or segment they did?  If they actually listened to it, they'd know how horrible it was.  I mean, if they really sat down and analyzed it, it's not just us being cynical.  Does that bother you as a young broadcaster?  I would say, literally, I was walking to my garage this morning thinking what a fucking  moron I was for thinking that I could get into radio and do radio. 
[00:48:00]  That I could have gotten into any other business and had an easier time getting a radio show.  Oh, yeah.  If I was working for a website or a magazine or I was on TV or I was a comedian or I was  a musical performer, then I could get a radio show easy.  Yeah, yeah.  And get man make money for it.  Yeah, way more.  But I did the stupid move.  If you do the traditional path of going to school for this and trying to learn it and  working on your craft and learning the whole business, you're screwed. 
[00:48:30]  What a dummy.  Yeah, it was very retarded of me to try to figure out how to do a good show because people  don't care about that anymore.  Yeah.  This company doesn't pay radio guys that well.  They're not looking for radio guys.  Past Howard, obviously.  You know what?  But then if you're in entertainment, they really pay those guys very well to do a radio  show, even though those guys have no idea what they're doing and I haven't.  I don't listen to any of those specialty programs because I know I'm not going to hear anything.  Do you think E-Rock could have come to us during commercials, let's say, on a walk to the 
[00:49:00]  bathroom and said, hey, do you know those guys talk about an hour in four hours?  And leave it at that.  I'm just saying.  You're saying you didn't need the graphs and the flow charts and the breakdown.  I have two pages here with color-coded fucking shit.  You know, it's amazing.  I want it to be thorough.  Thorough?  You know how we've presented.  Are you trying to say we could have done this in 30 seconds?  Holy shit, all fair.  All fair.  There's no fun in that. 
[00:49:30]  Exactly.  You know how we've in the past questioned E-Rock's time management and how much time  he spends on certain things.  Yes.  Yes.  You're saying he spent a little too much time on this?  This easily took 15 hours.  What?  I mean, he did three.  He just said he did three shows.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  Three times three is 12.  Really?  That's 12 hours of just shows.  Did he really?  Not in a row.  Oh, my God.  I don't even.  But you don't listen to the whole thing.  You just tag where you know they're done talking, where the music starts, where the traffic 
[00:50:00]  starts.  That's way too much work for no payoff.  Hey, guys.  Scott and Todd, do you realize, just quickly, I.  They talk an hour every show.  Yeah.  Instead of, they do a four-hour show.  They talk an hour.  Wow.  Really?  Fuck.  That seems like a good gig.  Even when we were on regular radio, we were bitching, but we still got about.  We're still bitching.  Yeah.  We still got about almost 40.  We got almost 40 minutes of talking an hour.  Sure. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  They're way below that, as we learned from the flow charts.  Charts.  Charts.  And the color coordination thing.  What does each color represent?  Yeah.  I was just showing you.  I threw my paperwork out a while ago.  When they talk and when they don't talk.  Follow along with your worksheet.  It's in the garbage.  Can you get it for me, please?  We gave you a ditto for a reason.  Iraq, why is songs slash commercials to 10 a.m. in red?  Oh, very good question.  When everything else is in blue or yellow.  That was to show that they just decided to not do the full four hours, and they figured 
[00:51:00]  they'll just pad it until 10 o'clock, so it counts.  Why is total talk time in four hours in the same blue you used for total talk time red?  That should have been the one in red.  Like, here's the big fucking reveal.  Yeah, red is a color you used for the big reveal.  I would have made songs, commercials to 10 a.m. blue, and made total talk time in four  hours, one hour, seven minutes, 35 seconds. 
[00:51:30]  I would have put that in red as the big, like, holy fuck.  No, you would not have wasted your time doing this at all.  This is true, too.  But the color red is kind of violating, so you know that should be, you know, same.  That's the big one, right?  That's the big one.  And that should be the last thing.  That's all this work.  Here you go.  Here it is in red.  Don't put the red and then end it with a blue under it.  Of course not.  It takes away from the wonderfulness of the red.  And why did he use yellow?  Do we know yet?  Caution.  Why yellow? 
[00:52:00]  Because other colors with the black font don't show up at all, so.  He printed out a few color copies and so what popped.  So what popped, yes.  That one really popped.  We all have our passions.  Iraq is obsessed with radio.  Yes.  Yeah, I used to be.  When there was radio to be obsessed with.  Yeah, absolutely.  And the same thing that probably Sam's going through.  I remember coming up in the business, being so frustrated, knowing that there was a lot 
[00:52:30]  of guys just, you know, taking up space.  Oh, there's so many guys.  So many guys just taking up space.  You're like, come on, man.  I'm ready to go here.  Yeah.  I've showed the passion.  I have, you know, skills for whatever level I was on it was, you know, at at the time.  Plus, I'm at the phase now where everybody tells me, oh, no, no, no.  We really like you.  You do great.  You're doing great.  Oh, I heard that for a while.  Cool.  That doesn't translate to any type of fucking money where you could actually pay your bills  for a while.  Yeah.  That might turn around, though.  Maybe.  I don't even know. 
[00:53:00]  I don't even know.  I don't know this version of the business at all.  By me.  I'm just happy we're still doing it, I guess.  Hey, you know what?  Yeah.  What else are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  What else are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  I mean, sure, maybe you'd like to talk for one hour, seven seconds, and 36 seconds, or  whatever the exact figure was, but at least somebody pays you to do that.  You're right.  How do you feel the segment went?  You spent 15 hours on it.  Give yourself a letter grade.  All right.  Letter grade. 
[00:53:30]  Like school.  And that's based on 15 hours of prep for it.  You really spent about 15 hours on this?  Not 15 hours.  Not in a row.  I think five hours.  You listened to three shows, so that's 12 hours right there.  We don't have to sit there and listen exactly.  I'm not sure what it did.  I don't know.  We'll find out eventually.  I'm going to grade the paper.  Okay.  Honestly, I'm going to grade it.  Well, is there, you know, sometimes it's different grades.  Well.  Well, presentation. 
[00:54:00]  No, I'm just going to give it a grade.  Okay.  It's definitely not going to be an incomplete.  Overall grade.  Let's see.  Oh.  Is that for effort or performance?  This is everything.  This is when you hand it a paper.  Is that passing?  When you hand it a paper.  It's sort of passing.  That is a grade.  Yeah, it is.  That is the grade right there.  Anthony just gave him a D.  A big D.  D.  It's a D.  Why is it a D?  Because it would be an F, but it's something.  Well, you can see the effort.  It's concise. 
[00:54:30]  You can see the effort.  Right.  He's never going to get into college with D's on his train script.  Even the color coordinating, the colors and stuff.  Hence, not the F.  All right.  It's there.  It's something.  I thought, as much as you guys bitch and complain about not being appreciated around here, and  that they don't really see the value of what you guys do, showing a comparison to what's  out there on terrestrial radio.  Well, we bitch about the wall. 
[00:55:00]  Why don't you give us a rundown, a part-by-part estimate of what it would cost as opposed to what  they said.  You know, people, obviously, because of On Demand and stuff, listen to the show all different  times during the day.  That's what makes kind of Twitter fun, because all of a sudden, somebody's hearing something  for the first time.  Yeah.  One guy just tweets, $500,000?  Yeah.  But it was out of nowhere.  I'm like, oh, he's finally hearing about the wall and how much it's going to cost to  remove a dumb wall here to give us more space. 
[00:55:30]  Do you have a letter grade?  No, I'm going to let him slide.  I see the passion in his eyes.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  You really tried in this segment.  You saw, right?  Mm-hmm.  I was watching you and doing some heavy lifting over there.  There's also teeth grinding there.  Really trying to make something out of this.  No, I wasn't grinding my teeth.  You were doing this.  I was mad that you were making me work so hard.  That's what it was.  Making me work so hard to keep the listeners interested in this.  There was a part two to this, but if you don't want to do part two.  The audio?  The audio. 
[00:56:00]  I'm scared to play the audio now.  I mean, if Ant gave you a D on the fucking paperwork, we got the audio, too.  There's audio along with this?  An audio presentation?  Ideally, shit.  There's a whole PowerPoint thing.  D's nuts.  It's D&D day!  Well.  Roland has just joined us.  I would bring you guys gourmet donuts, but your palate sucks.  I brought you the worst donuts ever.  Dunkin' Donuts.  I was expecting Dunkin' Donuts, but you brought this gourmet shit.  And then E-Rock ran away because... 
[00:56:30]  It's not just Dunkin' Donuts day.  E-Rock...  E-Rock...  This is an E-Rock day.  Okay?  Scott and Todd was not the big thing that he was planning for for today.  All week long, he's been planning for something.  And what is it?  He's going to present...  It's not Dunkin' Donuts day.  Oh, no.  It's not Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, no.  What is it?  E-Rock, tell him.  It's not Dunkin' Donuts day.  He just walked back in the studio.  He's hiding something.  What day is it?  I don't know.  Today is Tequila and Donut Day.  What the fuck is going on here? 
[00:57:00]  Tequila and Donuts?  There's two bottles of Patron.  One is silver and one is cafe.  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  Travis, what the fuck's going on?  Wow.  Like Sam said, Eric had an idea.  Yeah.  Here's his idea.  And the next time you shit on anyone, you see what happens when you give Sal and E-Rock  the first segment.  Holy shit. 
[00:57:30]  We did set up for this by giving Sal and E-Rock the first segment.  You're not missing anything.  And of course Sam is crying.  Because Sam and I have been so excited for this.  Why?  Because you knew it would be a bust-a-roo?  Now, do you realize tequila and donuts don't really go together, right?  Well, it wasn't supposed to be Tequila and Donut Day to start.  Yeah?  What happened?  But Nolan decided to add on the donuts to it.  It was just going to be Tequila Day.  Tequila.  How do you have a Tequila Day?  It's 7 in the morning.  How do you not?  It's 7 in the morning. 
[00:58:00]  All right, let's see you do a shot of tequila.  Who's going to do a shot?  Well, E-Rock's going to do one.  Tequila Day.  I swear to you, I don't even give a fuck if this is bombing out there.  This is the weirdest fucking morning in a while.  Holy shit.  That's why you've got to just keep rolling with it.  It might be bombing at a moment.  The Sal story should have been amazing.  It wasn't because he didn't stick around to get all the details.  And E-Rock presents us with something he worked on for, I think it is, close to 15 hours. 
[00:58:30]  He just doesn't want to admit it anymore.  It's in here.  And Aunt gave him a D on that.  And then he walks in with fucking tequila and Roland walks in with donuts.  Well, I figure you're going to eat these because it's breakfast.  Well, why?  Because it's breakfast.  Why are most of the donuts, they've got the holes in the middle, man?  You want to fill that shit in, don't you?  Because when you ask them to pick 12 donuts, they get very angry.  Yeah, because they want to get rid of the ones that don't sell well.  That's why you never tell them. 
[00:59:00]  I told the guy I want to pick and he screamed at me.  I know he called me some asshole or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Did he go,  No, I told him, your donuts are not that great.  Just let me pick.  Wow.  But he don't care.  He's just a worker.  They don't give a fuck if you're trashing your donuts.  They're not great.  They're pretty good goddamn donuts.  Which one you got there?  I got like an apple filled.  Ooh.  Pretty goddamn good.  Do your shot at tequila, Yorok.  I gotta get cups.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:30]  And then we got Scott and Todd audio.  Sam's crying.  Tequila at seven in the morning.  Yorok's going to do a shot at tequila.  Yorok's going to do a shot at tequila.  You think Eric's just bringing us into his life like he just drinks tequila and listens  to Scott and Todd?  And eats donuts and listens to Scott and Todd?  Yeah.  It makes no fucking sense at all.  The whole hour didn't make sense.  I know.  It's going to be one of the worst hours we've ever done.  I told you.  I like bizarre.  And that includes balloon guy. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, wow.  Holy fuck.  It could be.  We're all excited for it.  Later on, but not now.  That was a good donut.  All right.  All right.  So, Yorok has opened up the Patron.  He's just thrown in a coffee cup.  Down the hatch.  Down the hatch.  Here he goes. 
[01:00:30]  Yorok.  Salud.  And he just did a shot of tequila.  This is like so stupid and weird.  Wow.  It's tequila and donut day.  Yorok just did a shot of tequila.  At 7.15.  Will you be doing another shot?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Throughout the show.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  This could get interesting.  Yes.  And when do you start up, Roland?  Roland's waiting for 8. 
[01:01:00]  At nighttime.  I'm moving.  At nighttime.  I got to move.  You're moving?  Yeah.  Where?  Where are you going?  I'll tell you during commercial break night now.  Why are you moving?  I thought you liked where you were.  I do love it.  Are you going to stay in the area?  Mm-mm.  Coming back to Manhattan?  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think that's good for you.  Yeah.  You're a little isolated out there.  Roland.  Even though your...  You're leaving Long Island City.  Skyline pictures were terrific. 
[01:01:30]  Terrific.  Oh, good.  We'll get different fucking...  We'll get different pictures from Roland.  Right.  To the other side.  Well, I don't know if the listeners could handle it too much more, so we should probably  break before we do the Scott and Todd audio that E-Rock worked on.  He put a bottle away.  He's got two different kinds of tequila.  In case you guys want to...  Why are you crying?  It's just so bizarre.  It's just the craziest shit ever.  And there goes the donut.  But I'll tell you why it's bizarre.  Like, E-Rock...  E-Rock's all in.  Yeah, he is.  He came up with this concept. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, we're going to do tequila and donut day, and it's going to be a huge hit.  And I think he really believes we're all just going to sit around drinking tequila together.  And in the end, he's going to be the only one.  Of course he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what makes you laugh, right?  Of course.  Because he has no awareness that it's not going to work.  Because if anybody has any doubts, I'll sweep them away right now.  Kent loves a good drink.  He's not drinking tequila.  I can pretty much guarantee that.  I am doing a shot of tequila.  I can pretty much guarantee. 
[01:02:30]  While the sun is still in the sky.  Right.  And you know what was great?  This whole thing started.  Like, he got this idea.  Yeah.  When you guys were talking about tequila.  And you guys said you didn't even like tequila that much.  Yeah, I'm not a huge fan.  I'll have a shot here and there.  But E-Rock's the man.  He loves tequila.  He's like, we're doing tequila day, bro.  I was like, yes.  And then he did it.  He brought in tequila.  He's the man.  Travis, are you going to do a shot of tequila today?  No.  Roland may be a little later.  But it's tequila day.  Roland might be the only one that maybe later. 
[01:03:00]  Maybe Troy would like some.  Troy would.  He's down for him.  Troy's not here yet.  So now you've got to find people to drink tequila with.  That's your job.  Sal, are you going to have a shot of tequila?  I'm at work right now.  Oh!  Someone bringing up the whole work thing.  Yeah.  Of course, Sal would be the one.  Eric's got a breakfast tequila.  Yeah.  It's a breakfast tequila.  It's tequila and donuts.  There's coffee in the other one.  Right.  That's what I mean.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's fine, man.  That counts.  He brought in coffee and tequila.  But he's having some of the Patron silver. 
[01:03:30]  Be honest with you, Rocky.  You had no doubt in your mind that people would drink tequila with you?  Please be honest.  You want me to be honest?  I thought it would just be a way so I could drink tequila while we're doing the show.  No.  It's not true.  That's why I bought enough for everybody.  Yeah, but that's my question.  I don't even like the coffee one.  No, that's what I'm saying.  Spread it around.  Do you really believe everyone would be all in and start drinking tequila with you?  Take it to the offices upstairs.  See who wants a shot.  Maybe they want to join in on tequila and donut day. 
[01:04:00]  That would be crazy.  Makes no sense.  No.  Maybe Scott Greenstein wants a swig.  Maybe he wants to take a belt.  Yeah, just walk around with one hand with your Patron.  The other hand with all the donuts.  Wait a minute.  You could be the shot girl.  Donut?  Tequila?  Donut?  A lot of people saying on Twitter, I just check quickly. 
[01:04:30]  Excuse me.  They're saying at least it's not gay.  Well, that's true.  You're right.  You're trying to know how much Eric drinks.  Eric, do you want to do another shot before we go to break?  Do another shot real quick.  One more.  It's tequila and donut day.  Yeah, make it happen.  I think every time you have a donut, you've got to have a shot of tequila.  Right.  Let's start.  Can you tell us about the movie now?  And this is your segment, right?  You came up with tequila and donut day?  I came up with tequila.  All right.  You just had the donut.  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  But you came up.  Okay.  So you came up with tequila day.  You got to fucking have confidence in your segment.  Yeah.  You can't all of a sudden go like, nah, I won't do a shot.  It's fucking tequila and donut day now.  It's your bit.  Let's go.  One more.  It's already got a higher grade in my book than your Scott and Todd day.  What do you give tequila and donut day?  Right now, it's getting a fucking, a good B.  A good B.  A solid B or a solid B?  Are we talking B plus?  It's teetering on B plus.  This could definitely go to A before the end of the show. 
[01:05:30]  I'll tell you that much.  Plus, if Iraq's drunk on the air by the end of the show, it's a fucking A plus.  It's A plus.  Yes.  Could you get the word out to Nicole from the morning mashup?  Oh, shit.  I think she might enjoy a shot of tequila.  You probably don't have to tell her.  Open the bottle one more time.  She'll smell it.  Come over here like a bloodhound.  7.20.  She may not be here yet.  When do they start?  7.  Oh, my God.  They start walking around.  And how many hours do they do?  3? 
[01:06:00]  They do 3 and they've got 18 people that are on the air.  Jesus.  Noodles all over me.  Why are we the only ones that do 4 hours?  I don't know.  I think, don't they do like a couple hours and then they rerun it immediately after?  From 10 to 11, they rerun the first hour.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  We should do that.  Good for them.  Rerun this hour?  Oh, yeah.  Well, maybe not this hour.  Oh, boy.  Maybe not this hour.  This might be one of those one and dones.  Oh, boy.  We've got a few of those out there.  A little tequila burp there?  Yeah.  Hopefully you're listening live because you're not going to ever hear this hour again. 
[01:06:30]  Unless E-Rock starts puking from too much tequila.  Oh, boy.  So, the lesson we learned today is don't try.  No, no, no.  Not necessarily.  You could try.  Have you done the second shot, E-Rock?  You need to work on your awareness.  Oh, yes, Sam.  Well.  You know, it is tequila day, so part of that is a party, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I opened the invitation up to the mashup. 
[01:07:00]  Okay.  Rich said, tequila day, perhaps after my egg sandwich.  Okay.  There's some logic there.  And Nicole, who we all know likes to party every now and then.  Oh, yeah.  Said, that's fucking disgusting.  That's really weird.  Her feet?  She'll be here in 20 minutes.  Oh, I thought she was talking about her toes.  So, no takers just yet.  Wow.  So far, no takers with the tequila, E-Rock, just you.  E-Rock, I'm sure other people will come on board, you know, maybe by 8 a.m. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Other people will come around.  It's still early.  And I just realized.  I mean, I know, you know, he gets made fun of every now and then, but he's still a part  of the team.  I think it's like the fact that Gary hasn't been offered a shot of tequila is like a little  disrespectful.  That is disrespectful.  Yeah, you got to make sure you offer him whenever he arrives.  Yeah.  Around 9 o'clock, maybe he'll be here.  I don't know what time he gets here.  Did you float this by management?  Hey, we got a segment we want to do, Tequila Friday.  Oh.  So this didn't get approved. 
[01:08:00]  Are you going to try to expense the tequila?  No.  Look, he committed.  He did.  As far as I'm concerned, 10 points for E-Rock.  10 points.  Yeah, yeah.  How about you do your second shot?  Do your second shot before break.  And then we'll break.  We'll continue with Tequila and Donuts Friday.  Wow.  Well, there it goes.  And we continue with Scott and Todd audio that he worked on as well.  There it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he felt that one. 
[01:08:30]  I felt the bird.  How's that?  Good.  It's good.  You feeling it yet?  Not yet, no.  Feeling a little warmth feeling, though?  A little warm feeling?  No, but give it a little bit more, probably.  Better have another donut, too.  Maybe a glaze or sugar to kind of balance it.  Because chocolate's too much.  Chocolate and tequila doesn't work too well.  No, no.  Works like coffee.  I shit myself.  I'm not going to lie.  I had a piece of cake.  I tried the cake and drank a lot of tequila. 
[01:09:00]  Left a bar and exploded in my ass.  They were bad days.  Yeah, that's a bad day right there.  She goes, where are you going?  I shit myself, and I left.  The show started out a little weird today.  I was thinking, uh-oh.  But I think we're turning this thing around.  Yeah.  I think we're turning this thing around a little bit.  I think maybe during the break, since tequila, at its core, tequila day is a celebration.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Maybe I should spend some time trying to find some people that will take you to tequila shot.  That's exactly right.  Take you to tequila shot.  I don't drink.  I would do it.  He needs a drinking, buddy. 
[01:09:30]  Let's find some more people to do tequila with you guys.  Well, this segment almost made me forget how shitty Sal's story was.  Lack of pictures.  E-Rock saved the day.  He really did.  Yeah, I think you saved the day again, E-Rock.  Good one.  All right.  We got Rich Voss coming in a little later.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's playing Maguire's out there on Long Island.  So we got him coming in another hour or so.  That night.  And we got the Scott and Todd audio.  And more tequila shots for me.  And more tequila shots for E-Rock. 
[01:10:00]  Excuse me.  You feeling it yet?  Tequila burps at fucking 7.30.  You feeling it a little bit?  No, it'll happen soon.  He's feeling it.  The second you do a shot of tequila, you get that warm kind of...  But I had a donut right after.  Oh.  Might take a little.  It's about time we got Eric nice and loosened up on this show.  A little bit.  Oh, God.  We might see a new E-Rock today.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I can only imagine. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't think I've ever seen you really drunk.  Well, the last time was the paycheck night.  Oh, God.  That was a good one.  Yeah, the paycheck.  Oh, boy.  What a faux pas.  He referred to your lovely bride as the paycheck.  Holy wasted.  All right.  We'll break here.  More tequila, more donuts, and more stuff.  The Opinant 3 Show. 
[01:11:00]  It's Irish Music Day on the Opinant 3 Show.  Hey. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  We got a weird start today.  Very strange start.  Sal had a story that could have been really, really good that just kind of fell flat because  he decided to leave the area immediately because I guess there was too much excitement there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Basically, he was on a train that stopped, subway train that stopped, was sitting there  for about 10 minutes, and then they realized that this train isn't going to move forward  anymore.  They took the train out of service. 
[01:12:00]  Sal gets on the platform to see a massive commotion, a guy stuck between the train and  the platform, one leg, I guess.  So they might be able to save this guy.  It hasn't hit the news yet.  Sal's telling the story, but he doesn't have much to it because a cop said, hey, everyone  leave the area.  And Sal's one of the guys that immediately leaves.  When most of us would kind of like try to figure out a little workaround for a little  bit.  Get some fucking photos or video.  Something.  Or just stay, you know, stay close enough where you can still see what the hell's going 
[01:12:30]  on.  What's going on.  Exactly.  And then it's segment to E-Rock coming in with a big Scott and Todd segment with drafts  and dittos and all sorts of shit.  Handing out fucking papers.  He basically broke down the Scott and Todd show and we learned that they don't talk a  lot at all.  Yeah.  Just over an hour every morning on a four hour show.  That was it.  And then and then he decides it's tequila and donut day.  Tequila and donut day. 
[01:13:00]  How are you feeling, E-Rock?  It's starting to take effect.  And I heard you found someone to do a shot of tequila for tequila and donut day.  Nice.  I found a few people.  A few people.  One will do it right now.  A couple will come during their breaks.  Really?  Wow.  Who are these people?  Are we allowed to say?  Uh, the first person, I don't actually know what he does here, but his name is Dennis.  He sits outside our office.  Oh, Dennis is the one that drives me nuts about the Islanders every single day. 
[01:13:30]  Found out I was an Islanders fan, so we have a little chit chat in the bathroom every morning  about the Islanders.  Every time I see them.  The Islanders.  Well, I'm not in as much this year.  And of course, they're doing okay.  Let me fill you in on something also.  When baseball season kicks in.  He does the same to you with baseball.  It's the Yankees.  Oh, so maybe...  Oh, it's all about the Yankees.  Oh, boy.  The Yankees, Yankees, Yankees.  I thought he was just a hockey fan.  That's a little strange.  So he's going to do a shot.  I was breaking down the tequila thing with Anthony. 
[01:14:00]  E-Rock...  You know what, though?  I might be wrong, because people are now coming to the table to get their shots of tequila.  There he is.  What's up, Dennis?  Slobo.  How are you?  Thanks for the time.  He's calling E-Rock Slobo.  You picked up on the nickname, huh, Dennis?  Yes, yes.  You like that one?  Slobo.  It's fitting.  It's Roland's favorite.  Roland loves that nickname for E-Rock.  You going to do a shot of tequila?  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah, why not, right?  I'll celebrate the Islanders' win last night.  Oh, there you go.  I told you.  Islanders. 
[01:14:30]  Islanders.  Do they have a good team this year?  No.  The rich D-Pietro is down in the minor leagues.  He's doing some minor league stuff now.  Yeah, that makes our team better.  Yeah, there you go.  He's a bust.  We all know it now.  But with the injuries and all, he's now a bust.  And our superfan got arrested for spanking a girl in the parking lot or something.  What?  But he's saying he just hit her in the back.  Who?  What?  We have a superfan that's always been creepy.  He has, like, this gold, like, fucking, like, tinsel hair. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah?  He's been there forever.  Oh.  They arrest him in the parking lot for, like, smacking a girl in the ass or something.  Wow, I didn't know that.  It was her birthday.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Arrested?  Yeah, arrested.  And he's trying to say he just hit her in the back.  Used to be able to fucking smack her in the back.  Roland!  Roland's slamming a shot of tequila.  Roland just slammed some tequila.  Roland's got a different bottle of tequila, though.  What is that?  The Clooney.  The Clooney.  Casa Miga.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  That's good.  Which is the ball that pours yourself a shot?  That's the one that, what's-his-name advertises?  Is this the one? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  The guy who played Christopher Moltisanti on...  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Christopher.  No, it's not that.  It pours yourself a shot.  I just took your shot.  This is just regular Silver Patrol.  This is very nice.  It is.  Did you have yours already?  Dennis, what do you do here?  I know you...  Oh, that's a good question.  I know we've had a lot of conversations about the Islanders over the last few years.  I work in the music department.  The oldies channels.  I program some of the music.  Oh, really?  Also, while I DJ on the channels.  Whoa.  Well, I hear it in your voice, Dennis.  Wow. 
[01:16:00]  Anything with Cousin Brucey?  Yeah.  I work with Cousins sometimes.  You do work with Cousins?  Yeah.  I used to work with him back at CBSFM.  CBSFM!  Wow.  Did you know Ron Lundy?  I worked with Ron, yeah.  Ron Lundy.  Of course it was Ron.  It was a nice guy.  How about I Am Bebe?  I Am Bebe, 10 till 10, W-E-N-B-C.  That's all he said.  That and his name in time.  That was it.  I Am Bebe.  About 10 till 10 now.  Yeah.  I Am Bebe.  Brand new one now.  Starland Vocal Band.  66 W-E-N-B-C.  Got it. 
[01:16:30]  He really does.  That's it.  And he just slammed a shot of fucking tequila.  Hello, love.  This is nice.  This is nice.  You like that?  I'm not doing shots today.  Sam's not a big drinker.  There was a disc jockey in New York years ago, Ted Brown.  And every, I think, Memorial Day, he used to get drunk on the air.  Like a doctor would come in and each time.  And we did that at a radio station I worked with.  But the DJ didn't like alcohol, so he drank like whiskey sours.  And all he did was get nauseous by the end of the day.  Yeah, whiskey sours.  You can't drink.  I want to show how drunk you can get.  I want to show how much alcohol. 
[01:17:00]  Before the big Memorial Day weekend.  It'd be like, yeah, exactly.  They'd give you the breathalyzer.  Yeah, normally these things are done on just the supervision of like a police officer  with a breathalyzer.  It says a lot that it's not going to do a shot of tequila.  It's too early.  It's too fucking early.  Eight o'clock comes soon.  Oh, God.  There's no way.  Nine o'clock?  No way.  I am going to do a shot in the morning.  You drove in, didn't you?  I just can't, huh?  You drove in.  Well, I have to drive home.  I didn't know if you were staying in the city or not. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, boy.  He's slurring.  I like it.  He started.  A little slur?  He went, it's a little.  It's very slight.  Yeah.  Only us drunks can really pick up on it.  But he said, he goes, like the S.  He said, I didn't know if you were staying in the city or not.  I didn't know if you were staying.  He's trying very hard.  You can see it.  He's trying very hard to keep his enunciation.  And you know what's starting to pipe through a little bit?  Some of that E-rock confidence.  Oh, shit.  Liquid Courage.  Liquid Courage. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  Why didn't you buy the coffee tequila Patron?  Oh, boy.  Because, actually, people really do like it.  I don't care for it.  But a lot of people like that better than the silver Patron.  I bought both.  Silver Patron.  Yeah, it's good.  You want another shot, Dennis?  I want another shot, Denny.  Denny.  Denny.  What do you say, Denny?  D-Man.  With the Islanders.  The D-Meister.  Yeah.  Another almost 500 seeds.  E-rock's pouring him a little cup.  And another shot for E-rock.  And E-rock.  E-rock, why are you putting the cap on that? 
[01:18:30]  I have mine.  Oh, shit.  On the hat.  There it goes.  E-rock, is this your third shot?  This is my third.  All right.  All right.  Denny.  All right.  Because I'm doing the South Beach Diet, so I really got to watch my hydrates.  It doesn't work.  This guy's got a million of them.  Yeah.  Do you want to do a little more radio for us?  You got another impression, please?  DJ Dennis.  One of the twos.  Well, yeah.  I also do a little mobile DJ work, too.  So if you're ever having a private party, you need somebody.  You know, I know you always throw a big Super Bowl party, so if you ever need a DJ, you  know, I'll bring the tunes along.  We'll rock the house. 
[01:19:00]  We'll rock the house.  We'll rock the house.  We'll get everybody up to do the Harlem Shake.  Do you do that?  I do.  I'm one of the kids, Dennis.  The youngsters.  You know the kids.  They're always doing the wacky thing, like the Harlem Shake or the Macarena.  So you're doing that mobile DJing on the weekends?  Sure.  I've been doing that for a long time.  Wow.  God bless you.  I had to bring out the DJ.  I did it for one summer up in, where was I?  Rochester or Buffalo?  Rochester, maybe?  No, Buffalo?  I don't remember.  Oh, boy.  I think it was Buffalo. 
[01:19:30]  I hated it.  Really?  Yeah, man.  You're going there to give the people four hours of fun, and you're working out with  some money?  Oh, what kind is that?  It looks like shit covered.  That is the shittiest.  You picked the shittiest looking donut.  That's a blueberry donut.  Yeah.  I recognize that.  Are the blueberries evenly distributed through the entire donut?  They sure are.  Equal number of blueberries in every donut.  Do you know how long that would take?  I love the guy's face.  Do you know how long that would take?  Dennis, you want to talk up a record for us?  Equal number.  Sure, we're playing.  What do you got?  Any songs here?  Oh.  Well, what kind of...  What's your genre?  Well, I like the oldies. 
[01:20:00]  You got any 70s?  Oldies.  A little 70s on 7?  70s on 7!  That's where the cousin is.  Give us a band.  He's on 60s on 6.  Give us a band.  A little Saturday Night Fever music, maybe?  A little Bee Gees.  Ah, the Bee Gees.  Should we talk it right to the post?  I could try.  All right.  What about Night Fever?  A little Night Fever, 1978.  It's a good song, right?  Biggest selling album of all time up until Thriller.  Wow!  That's amazing.  I love this.  That was a double album.  Now it's available on one disc, one CD.  Amazing, the future.  What the future held for us, we didn't know. 
[01:20:30]  You can't fucking clean your pot on it, though.  Right?  Double album was great for cleaning your weed.  I feel like my alarm clock hasn't gone off yet.  What is going on?  So, Dennis is rocking the ones and twos.  What do you mean?  Dennis.  What the fuck's going on?  I like it.  I swear to God, what's going on, Sam?  What's Tequila Day?  Tequila is Friday.  We left the creative of the show in the hands of Eric Nagle today.  I have a feeling.  I have a feeling.  People are going to get fired.  Watch it.  Here's what's going to happen.  I'm going to hear a sound, and it's going to be my alarm going off, right? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  And then I'm going to wake up.  I'm going to come into the show.  Right.  And the first break is going to be me trying to convey this dream to you.  Right.  And it's not going to make any sense at all.  No.  You're just going to be like, wait, what?  So why was it Tequila Friday?  I'll be like, I don't know.  It was a dream.  It's so weird.  Eric was in charge of the show for the day.  I don't know what happened.  Put it this way.  Sal started the show.  What?  And it's like, what?  That would never happen.  And that's just because he told me he had an interesting story.  Well, he told you wrong. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  Well, Dennis wants to talk up Night Fever.  You got Night Fever?  I like Night Fever.  Oh, this is a good one.  Bee Gees.  Robin Barry Maurice.  Unfortunately, most of them are not with us anymore.  But we do have the memories here on SiriusXM, commercial-free, 70s on 7.  Don't forget every weekend, Casey Kasem here counting them down, just like he did back in the day.  That's pretty good.  He's got the voice, man.  That's pretty smooth. 
[01:22:00]  You got the smooth fucking voice, man.  Too bad that voice doesn't pay off.  I like it.  I slur my way through a show every morning and make a fucking boatload of money.  Enjoy your golden voice.  Go fuck yourself.  I slur my way through the morning.  Jesus.  This guy has the actual pipes and voice.  He's got the good voice.  It's smooth.  And then he has the mobile DJ on weekends to make ends meet.  Oh, Christ.  God, I love my life. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, Denny.  That is fucking funny.  Oh, sorry.  I'm still here.  Denny's still here.  Denny, you want another song, maybe?  No, that's okay.  DJ Denny.  We're enjoying this, though, man.  But I do have work to do today.  Oh, shit.  You need to wait a little longer.  You got to run some channels.  I want to make the subscribers happy.  That is a good fucking goal.  Wow, that's so weird.  Why would you want to do that?  Because I don't have the chance to get up and slur my words through every song.  All right, you got to leave us with one more.  All right, sure.  Yeah, one more tune.  What could we get from the 70s-something? 
[01:23:00]  How about the 60s?  I like the 60s.  Oh, the 60s, too.  Okay.  How about the Mamas and the Papas?  How about the Swing of Medallions?  You got that?  Double Shot of My Baby's Love?  That's a good one.  Whoa.  All right.  That's a tequila shot day.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Iraq, can you find it?  The Animal House vein of the Frat Rock.  Oh.  A little Frat Rock for the weekend.  Oh, here we go.  1965 Sirius XM.  60s on 6.  Don't forget, tomorrow night.  Right around 8 o'clock Eastern time.  Everybody's favorite cousin, Cousin Brucey, will be here taking your request. 
[01:23:30]  So make sure you check him out.  Sirius XM, let's swing with the medallions one time.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm digging it.  That's good.  He's smooth.  Denny.  Well done.  He's a pro.  I got a question for Dennis.  Yeah.  I don't know how things work on other channels.  Yeah.  Let's say on the 70s on 7, if you came in one day and you were, or say 60s on 6, you  went into like Brucie and everybody's there and you brought in two bottles of tequila.  And you go, hey everybody, it's tequila shot day.  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  And you just started getting yourself fucked up while you were programming the music.  How would that go over?  I'd probably be back working at an AM radio station somewhere.  Yeah, exactly.  Driving the van.  Yeah, that's why no one's talking about those guys.  Giving away koozies or something.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  That's why no one's talking about those shows.  No balls.  They don't know how to think out of the box there.  Yeah.  I'm all in for tequila and donut day, you rock.  I've turned the corner.  I am too.  Woo!  It's great.  Who's the next person to come in and do a shot?  We're waiting for other shows to go to break and then they'll come in.  All right.  Dennis has work to do. 
[01:24:30]  Thank you, guys.  He's got work to do.  Have a great weekend.  See you back here on Monday morning, okay?  Night?  Night?  Look at him.  He's got that smooth voice, man.  Very smooth.  I like it.  I'm going to put in a good word for you with Scott Greenstein.  Ooh.  Going to move you up a little bit in the organization.  I'll drink to that.  I'll drink to anything at this point.  You want a donut?  No, I'm okay.  It's donut and tequila day.  You can't have tequila without the donut.  Mm-mm.  You sure?  Nope.  Oh, you've got the South Beach.  Yeah, I'm doing the South Beach.  Oh, South Beach.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Because, you know, before you know it, it's bikini season.  Keep a little svelte.  Oh, Danny.  You wear a ball bag?  A ball bag.  A banana hammock?  Yeah.  Cheers, guys.  A salute.  Thank you very much.  A salute.  Appreciate being a part of it.  Hope you enjoyed the tequila on this tequila Friday.  What a nice guy.  Yeah, he is a nice guy.  Danny's a nice guy.  Yeah.  And he loves the Islanders.  What happened?  I never see your desk anymore when I come in in the morning.  I have another desk.  I come in a little later.  Ah.  I used to come in at 5 o'clock Eastern time. 
[01:25:30]  You did?  Now I'm back in at 7 a.m.  Oh, man.  Okay.  Two hours.  Oh, good for you.  Yeah.  Must be nice.  Mm-hmm.  Take the Long Island Railroad in every day.  Oh.  With all the laborers, all the union guys.  Ah.  Regular Joe's with their container of coffee.  And we need a big lunch box.  Hey, yeah.  To look at you and see.  That's all I know.  There's a labor, right?  A lot of times.  A laborer.  A lot of times, Roland will go up to Dennis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And say, I'll buy you a burger if you walk into E-Rock's office and yell out,  Slobo. 
[01:26:00]  And Dennis does it every time.  And he's a nice guy, though, Slobo.  You know, he plays along.  Oh, Slobo.  I haven't said Slobo in a while.  No, but Roland.  I might have started that one, but I've since stopped calling him that.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah, you started it.  Nope.  How you feeling, E-Rock?  I'm doing all right.  Three shots in.  I'm doing good.  Yeah?  You're doing okay?  You're fine?  You're dandy?  I'm dandy.  Good.  I have a feeling he's going to be on Ron and Fez today. 
[01:26:30]  Fucked up.  I hope so.  Yeah.  Hey, E-Rock, why don't you come in here?  So it's tequila Friday, huh?  Have some shots.  Pepper will do some shots with you.  Pepper would do some shots, right?  Hey, you brought Scott and Todd audio today, too.  Yes.  Now, what's this about?  Over the years with...  Danny, you can leave.  There's no...  We can't give you the official goodbye.  Just get out of here.  Go.  Take it easy, my friend.  Go program some oldies, please.  Put in some fucking... 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Add in Midnight Confession.  I like that.  Midnight Confession.  And Vanilla Fudge version of Set Me Free.  Oh, you keep me hanging on.  Keep me hanging on that one.  Yeah, yeah.  You keep me hanging on.  Long version.  No edits.  Ta-na-ta-na-ta-na-ta-na-ta-na-ta-ta-ta.  Set me free.  Why don't you, babe?  Get out my life.  Why don't you, babe?  Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  This is some drug music right here.  Turn this up.  Beep.  Whoa.  It's groovy.  Gee.  This song's seven minutes.  It's okay.  What else are we doing?  All right.  This is fucking...  Gee, gee, gee.  There's a live version of this on YouTube.  Yeah.  It's fucking hilarious.  Why?  Because they just look like they're fucked up out of their minds.  Whoa. 
[01:28:00]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Tonight, from New York.  Oh, here I...  Whoa.  That's the wrong version.  Tequila Friday, everybody.  See, kids, you can't drink and drive.  Tequila Friday.  Who's driving this ship?  Exactly.  This is...  It's like, whoa, this is song seven and a half minutes long.  It's not a song.  What was that other version from?  It said from Ed Sullivan. 
[01:28:30]  Oh.  Well, it was Sullivan.  It was Sullivan years.  Ed Sullivan.  It probably was.  That way.  What from...  Oh, my God.  This is some drug music.  This is severe drug music.  This is the H.  The intro is so long.  Man, I'm having to talk this up.  Let's have Dennis do it.  And, uh...  Denny!  Wow!  Denny!  You can talk this shit up.  Join us a week from next Tuesday.  We're just running through all the days. 
[01:29:00]  This one's taking you right back to the 60s.  You know the era of Woodstock.  Free love.  Oh, summer of love, baby!  Here on WCBS FM 60.  Talking on...  This would be forever.  Denny!  Denny!  Denny!  All right.  Here it comes.  No?  That was the big intro.  Turn it up a little bit.  A little more volume. 
[01:29:30]  He was the drummer in Vanilla 5.  Wasn't it?  What's the name?  Peace of...  Carmine?  Carmine at Peace, was it?  Didn't he join after the fact?  All right, maybe.  Set me free, why don't you, babe?  Get out my life, why don't you, babe?  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!  You really don't want me.  You just keep me hanging on. 
[01:30:00]  You're real handsome.  You're real handsome.  You just keep me hanging out.  And there ain't nothing I can do about it.  How do you keep coming around?  Got a few people really questioning E-Rock.  Really?  This guy Joe, North Carolina.  There's got to be something behind Eric drinking Patronus, Earl.  Ah.  Is there something else going on with you, E-Rock?  Kebang.  No.  This is just based off the conversation we had earlier in the week about Tequila. 
[01:30:30]  All right.  You coming in for the Scott and Todd audio that you brought to the show?  You want me to?  Sure.  I certainly do.  And we'll celebrate to Scott and Todd while he's in here.  He's three shots in, right?  Shot of tequila.  Three shots in is a good fucking buzz.  Don't you think it?  You're feeling it.  That's a pretty good buzz.  But you've got to watch when he's pouring too.  I think he's going light with the shots.  No, he's not.  Look at the bottle.  I've been watching the bottle.  Oh.  Maybe I'm wrong then.  That's a good, pretty decent hit taken out of that bottle already. 
[01:31:00]  And also you've got to realize the weight to liquor ratio there.  Sure.  Somebody who's a little more rotund can drink a little more than someone who's a little  more of a slight frame.  That's a polite fat joke.  No.  No, it's actually just the, like, fat.  But that's okay.  All right.  So.  Iraq, why not just pour another shot? 
[01:31:30]  And.  There's no one else in here.  What?  Well, you've got to still keep it going.  It's your fucking bitch.  It's tequila Friday.  Let her rip.  Do you want another donut, too?  Nah, I'm going with it.  Oh.  He doesn't like sweets.  We've learned that over the years.  Yeah, it's.  Not a big fan of the sweets.  There ain't nothing I could do about it.  Tintin.  You know I need your love.  Jesus.  You really think he's fucking nursing himself?  No, I know.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:32:00]  I just saw that.  Whoops.  It's the real deal.  This is the man.  Eric Nagel.  I poured a little too much.  Denny.  By the way, Denny's not working yet.  Get him back in here.  Denny's just walking around.  Look at him.  He's wandering aimless.  Oh, I think he just heard the reef.  He just heard the fucking.  He turned around.  He's walking back.  He's like, the office is talking to me.  He's coming back.  Denny's coming back.  Wow.  He's got a swagger.  Yeah.  You notice he's got a swagger when he wants? 
[01:32:30]  He didn't have that swagger earlier.  No, he didn't.  Tequila gives you a swagger.  Woo.  Here comes Denny.  He's going to do one more.  Denny's going to do one more.  I'm going to do one more.  You're doing one more?  I'm going to do one more.  One more, Denny.  You're doing one more, Denny.  Oh, he's chewing gum.  Smart move.  We'll do another one.  We just played the vanilla fudge.  I heard it.  Yeah.  You like it?  Yeah.  It's good.  The long version.  You know what, though?  You guys always program in the short version.  And he doesn't go, 
[01:33:00]  And there ain't nothing I could do about it.  He doesn't do that in the short version.  No, just the single version.  Yeah, I don't like the single version.  You've got to do the long version.  WNBC playing the long versions of songs.  That was Bob Pittman's thing when he first went over there.  Really?  Playing the long versions of songs.  That was the selling one.  Yeah, that was it.  That's fantastic.  Ellie Dilling came in and did mornings.  Remember that?  No.  She replaced Imus.  I remember the Nightbird, Alison Steele.  Oh, she was on any WFN.  That was, yeah.  Wait, who was the guy that replaced Imus and he was known for what?  Ellie Dillon, who I believe was dating Bob Pittman. 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  He knows all this dirt.  Right.  All the radio dirt.  My mother used to call us Radio Rats.  Radio Rats.  Radio Rats.  Yeah.  Do you want to talk up another song before you shout out Tequila?  And add in, like, Tequila and Donut Day, by the way.  Oh, well.  You want to sell that?  Yeah, you've got to add that in.  Yeah.  Hey, it's, you know.  The listeners are getting involved.  Just got a tweet from Struff.  Yeah.  Who's at home doing Shots of Tequila. 
[01:34:00]  Nice.  Nice.  On this Tequila Friday.  Tequila and Donut Friday.  Makes no sense.  Hey, do we have Lot of Love by Nicolette Larson?  I like that one from 1979.  Let's get Nicolette Larson, Lot of Love.  Is that one gonna take a lot of love?  There you go.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, okay.  Remember that.  You got that one, Sal?  Hold on.  You don't just start.  Oh, come on.  Jesus, Sal.  Sal.  I was out.  I have no idea what's going on right now.  I come back.  You not only saw a train wreck.  You are one.  Sam, he doesn't even know what's going on. 
[01:34:30]  I was out getting breakfast for Voss.  And what happened?  I'll come back.  What did you see and not take a picture of?  There's a half-eaten donut in here.  It smells weird in here.  Danny's talking up the records.  He's talking up records today.  Here's what you do.  I'll just give it to me like this.  It's gonna be a little tighter than that.  All right.  1979 hit music.  You know, it's gonna take a lot of love as we get through the weekend together.  But it's gonna be a lot easier because we're celebrating Tequila and Donut Day here on the ONA Show.  It's a Friday morning.  Nice to have you along. 
[01:35:00]  Make sure you keep it right here on Sirius XM.  Go ahead, Nicolette.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa, right there.  He's fucking good, man.  Snakey, you like Denny?  Dennis, that's good, man.  We got Snakey in here.  Snakey!  Snakey!  I am such a fucking...  I appreciate the old school radio.  So to see a guy working it, I like it.  He's pretty good at it.  I practice in the car all the time.  Do you?  Right.  You talk up songs in the car?  And I'm one of the guys I used to have my air check on.  Right, yeah.  And I would, like, pull up to a light, put it in the cassette deck.  Sure.  And then turn it up. 
[01:35:30]  Oh.  Practice in the car as you try to figure out how you're gonna pay your cable bill.  I practice my racial slurs in the car.  I'm getting very good at it.  And I would just yell out, I'm available for private parties.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  Have you guys heard his spot-on Ira impression?  Ira the weatherman?  Do you do a good Ira?  How you doing?  Now you would walk in.  Hi, how you doing?  Do you know there's a new country station?  Yeah, I listen to satellite radio, Ira.  Well, is Cousin Brucey live tonight?  It's like he's here.  It's spot-on, that one. 
[01:36:00]  That was spot-on.  Wow.  Stinky, you want a shot of tequila?  Never.  You said yes?  Yeah, I'll take one.  Oh, shit.  Stinky!  Fucking goddamn greenfield.  I didn't think tequila day would be a hit, eh?  You know what?  I love to be proven wrong.  I was with you on this one.  Well, I don't.  You don't really like being proven wrong ever.  What are you talking about?  Neither one of us likes to be proven wrong.  Right, you are.  But I will say we have been proven wrong, because I'm agreeing with you on this.  I didn't think tequila and donuts Friday was going to have lunch. 
[01:36:30]  I'm okay with being proven wrong.  I'll give you that much.  Okay.  I'm okay with it.  I am impressed by it.  A lot of money.  That stammer's worth a lot of money.  Irak, do you have another one?  Yes, I do.  And Stinky?  Irak, this is five for you?  This is four.  He didn't do his fourth.  Oh, he didn't do his fourth.  Oh, is that the one where you said, oh, I poured a little too much?  Yeah.  By the way, Stinky enjoying both donut and tequila on Tequila Donut Day.  Tequila Donut Day. 
[01:37:00]  Who wouldn't like the combination?  Is Ira here today?  It goes together like fucking oil and water.  830.  Can we get him to do a shot of tequila?  Hmm.  Oh, that would be nice.  Drink scotch.  Jay would have my balls.  I'm a scotch drinker.  I kind of rebuilt the bridge with Jay Thomas.  But do you drink tequila?  Right before the holidays.  Never.  Dennis, you're leaving us again?  Dennis, it's just...  Oh, Dennis, it's just...  Dennis!  I have to work on the Herman's Hermits show.  We do a Peter Noon every Saturday afternoon.  Something tells me I'm meant for something good. 
[01:37:30]  Wait, did you hear this shit?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Peter Noon from Herman's Hermits does a show for us on the 60s on 6.  Oh, dude.  On Saturday afternoons.  What could he possibly do with that show?  Well, he's got a lot of recollections about the 60s and the British Invasion music.  Remember I was telling you about people getting shows?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It doesn't fucking matter whether you're trying to go to the radio or they'll give you a show.  And, you know, a lot of the British Invasion music has its roots in the R&B music of the 50s.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a lot of good stuff in there, too.  The crickets don't even care.  A buddy Holly and the crickets? 
[01:38:00]  I know.  See?  A lot of great stuff.  He didn't know that.  He just meant the crickets sound.  But, yeah, yeah.  Buddy Holly and the crickets.  You want to talk about some Herman's Hermits?  He's got some great.  Yeah, sure.  Get some Herman's Hermits.  What song?  Which one?  How about Mrs. Brown?  You've got a lovely band.  Ah, Mrs. Brown.  You've got a...  Yeah.  Not much of an intro, I don't think, on that one.  I'll take care of it for you.  I'll take care of it for you.  Here we go.  You got that one in there for me?  Oh, boy.  Flash?  Come on, Flash.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Sal's just panicking.  Sal.  Sal, you've got to pick up the slack.  Sal, you haven't even been drinking.  Sal, this is why, you know, we're trading you. 
[01:38:30]  E-Rock is celebrating.  So obvious.  I got it.  Oh.  Oh, all right.  Wait for his cue.  Give it to me.  Sirius XM, the 60s on 6.  Don't forget, tomorrow afternoon, 5 o'clock Eastern Time, it's Peter Noon here on the  Something Good Show.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll have it.  It was a little abrupt, though.  I hit it right there.  He did hit it.  You know what I used to say?  I'd say, hey, Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter, and you're not so bad yourself.  You know?  And then he goes, you know? 
[01:39:00]  You know?  You know?  Yeah.  This is great.  What you could do in the oldies radio field, you'd have those good lines on index cards.  No way.  And you would just rotate them?  Well, yeah, every once in a while.  Did you ever do the one, uh, uh, they ain't, wait, they ain't related, but they do be brothers.  That's a good one.  That was a big one, too.  Write that one down.  They ain't related, but they do be brothers.  You remember that, or I got an index card with that on it, O?  I actually did that one.  I'm embarrassed to say I did that one.  You know, it's a good one that I heard on an air check from a guy out at KING in Seattle. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  He was playing, uh, Love on a Two-Way Street by The Moments.  Uh-huh.  Of course.  He said, uh, he goes, I've got Love on a Two-Way Street, but that don't mean that I go both ways.  Whoa!  That's a gay bashing joke.  I love it.  I thought that was a little homophobic.  I thought that was a little blue, so I didn't want to do that.  Hey, Love on a Two-Way Street, but my asshole's one way.  Eagle!  You missed what you said.  What happened?  He goes, I don't do that one.  It was a little blue.  A little blue.  A little blue.  A little blue.  Yeah, that was left to, like, the overnight guys, right? 
[01:40:00]  Talking about dicks.  We always made sure that the overnight guys cleaned the cart machines.  That was their job?  Clean the cart machines and emptied a coffee pot.  All right.  I was that guy.  Oh, O.P.  I cleaned the coffee pots in Buffalo, and I did clean the carts.  I know exactly what he's talking about.  Yeah, I'd take the alcohol with the Q-tip.  With the big Q-tip.  You're fucking beating me up right now.  I remember cleaning the cart machines at fucking AF.  That was my job when I did overnights in Buffalo.  One of the guys who used to smoke in the studio, then the glass.  You'd wipe the glass down. 
[01:40:30]  Brown.  Brown.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy knows his shit.  What are some of the other go-to lines?  The go-to lines.  Hey, the weekend's here.  Hey, thank God for Friday.  TGIF.  Hey, thank God it's Friday.  And if you had a morning man whose name was Frank, you used to say, hey, TGIF, thank  God it's Frank.  He'll be here tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock, bright, light, and early-like.  Oof.  Yeah.  Wow.  Used to have the cliches.  Yeah, of course.  Is that what they called him?  He's great.  I love this.  The cliches.  Denny.  Denny.  Fucking Dennis is fantastic with this radio history. 
[01:41:00]  But the thing on Friday is you don't want to talk about Monday because you don't want  people to get down.  People want to enjoy the weekend.  They're feeling up on Friday.  So don't mention Monday.  Don't mention Monday.  Well, what do you mention on Mondays?  You mention Monday, 3 o'clock on Sunday afternoon because then people start putting themselves  into a Monday point of view.  Yeah, I feel like that.  Research has shown Sunday at 3 p.m. is when people start thinking about Monday.  Yeah.  3 o'clock.  5 o'clock.  You start going like, ah, tomorrow's work.  But what do you do on Monday to get them through?  Because now they're like, ah, fuck, it's Monday.  Wednesday. 
[01:41:30]  Think of Wednesday.  Get over the hump day.  Don't forget it.  Well, Wednesday we'll be giving away concert tickets.  Oh, so there's something to look forward to.  Well, no, what do you do on Monday, though?  But that's good.  It's something to look forward to on a Monday.  Oh, Wednesdays.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I see.  And then Wednesday, you start getting into the weekend, mind.  Right.  Don't forget, Friday, 5 o'clock, we start the British Invasion Weekend.  All your favorites from those British years.  I hope he just keeps cringing.  I was kind of in the world for a while.  You remember that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  It's fantastic.  God bless you guys.  I like it.  All right, I got it.  Well, I do have some guys. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  You guys, sorry.  Oh, do the shots, then.  Here they go.  Sneaking E-Rock, fucking clinking coffee cups with tequila in it.  Oh, yeah.  How is it, Garrett?  It's horrible.  Is it terrible?  Why is it horrible?  Why is it worse?  Because it's so early.  It's early, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock felt that one.  How many is E-Rock on?  Yeah.  I think that's four.  E-Rock's eyes are all glassy now.  Four impressive shots, though.  Yeah.  Impressive.  Look at the bottle.  You should go to the diner after this for grilled cheese, hash browns, and some home fries, right?  That's right.  Hash browns and gravy. 
[01:42:30]  All-American radio kind of breakfast.  All right, Danny.  That's good, Dan.  Thank you.  And you know what a good thing is?  When you go to a restaurant, you'd call up.  You'd tell the waitress you work at the radio station.  And you'd call back, and you'd say, oh, give a shout-out.  I'm down here at, you know, so-and-so, the Starlight Diner.  Hey, you'll like this one, Danny.  Oh, and then you get to.  You know what Scorch used to do to waitresses?  Oh.  A waitress would be like.  Pop them in the ass.  While you're trying.  The waitress would go, hey, aren't you on the radio?  Well, yes.  And then Scorch would say, no, I'm right here. 
[01:43:00]  Ah, see, because.  Scorch, you need a bell.  You can have that one, Danny.  Oh, yeah.  Danny, you take that.  Enjoy that line, okay?  Yeah.  There goes Danny.  It means something else here, though.  All right, Dan, thanks.  Where'd he go?  I thought we were going to do some stuff.  He is a little piece of radio history right there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God, it's so funny.  That's a little blue.  But it doesn't mean I go both ways.  Holy shit.  I swear I don't know what's going on.  It's amazing. 
[01:43:30]  It's tequila day.  Tequila and donut day.  It's tequila and donut day.  That's all you need to know.  Where did Iraq go to?  I don't know.  Iraq.  Oh, shit.  Where is he?  Sal doesn't know where he is today.  He's MIA.  He just wandered off.  He just walked off.  Toward the bathroom?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  He might have the donut chips.  Someone's going there.  He might be puking, maybe.  Sal's going to look.  Maybe that last shot has him with the donuts and the shot.  He looked fucked up after the last one.  Dude, his eyes were tearing up.  I know.  It's Z-Rock, but he hasn't eaten yet, really.  He's only had the two donuts.  He hasn't grazed yet.  Really start grazing.  Yeah.  Denny's a trip. 
[01:44:00]  He is.  You know what?  I've never said more than two words to the guy or heard him.  He's usually like, hey, you catch the game last night?  I'm like, yeah, if I can, you know, oh, Yankee.  He's one of the nicer guys around here.  Yeah, but to hear him, I didn't know he was very involved with the music stations.  I do.  That's why when we came to New York, so many people hated us, especially in the business,  because we weren't following the mold of the radio guy.  And they also knew if we were successful, a lot of those guys would have to go.  Exactly. 
[01:44:30]  Did you rock?  Where did you run off to?  Iraq, what happened?  I had to pay.  Oh, did you?  Is it the tequila?  Well, I didn't get to go last break, so.  What?  Well, we could break, and then we could do the Scott and Todd audio that you brought  in.  Okay.  How do you feel?  I mean, is Tequila Donut Day doing well?  It's doing well.  I really thought it was going to be a bust.  You know what?  I thought it was going to be a complete bust.  Right.  And Dennis to come in.  It's just been...  Who's next?  It's a party.  I'm going to go find some more people.  Find some more people?  Are you feeling it? 
[01:45:00]  I'm feeling it.  You are a little bit?  In what way?  You're on.  I'm very hot.  Oh, you're very...  Yeah, look at his face.  It's all red.  I'm glad you're a little fluffy.  Take off your hoodie.  A little red.  Take off your shirt, dude.  It's Tequila Friday.  Whatever.  Let your hair down.  Take your pants off.  It's all good.  It's all good.  We've got to film something in the elevator today.  Oh, E-Rock, Drunk E-Rock Elevator Show.  We'll figure something out.  I need a new show for next week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Went with an old show yesterday because I was too busy with all the shit.  Never. 
[01:45:30]  We'll have a brand new episode next week.  Travis, how do you feel?  I'm fine.  Travis?  You're not going to get fired.  You had nothing to do with this.  It's Tequila or Donut.  I'm not going to get fired.  Eric's a senior producer.  I'm a producer.  Oh, gee.  Oh, gee.  Nobody's going to get fired on a Tequila Friday.  Get out of here.  This is two hours of content.  It's a party.  This is sanctioned by E-Rock.  It's fine.  I swear I don't even know if this is good.  It's good.  Oh, I love it.  It's so weird.  I thought Dennis had a great first appearance.  You know what?  Dennis rules.  You're right.  That was Dennis' first appearance on the program, and I think he nailed it.  Yeah.  He nailed it. 
[01:46:00]  He's talking those songs up.  He's adding in the little tidbits of information about the music.  Eric is sweating, by the way.  Yeah.  E-Rock, are you sweating?  I'm hot.  Yeah.  Your cheeks are all red, and yeah.  It's just strange because it's not that warm in here.  No.  No.  I turned the air conditioner around.  Yeah, it's pretty good today.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  It was great.  It was a good Friday show.  I feel sorry for Denny.  Why is that?  I know a lot of guys.  I mean, radio is a tough fucking road, man.  It is. 
[01:46:30]  Really tough fucking road.  Yes, it is.  And I was making no money when I started out on radio, and I did the mobile DJing thing.  I fucking hated it.  I had to do two in a night sometimes.  Oh, man.  I did at least two a weekend minimum, but sometimes it was like four in a weekend.  I had to go to this guy's house.  He had a garage, and he would set up all the DJ equipment, and my name would be on it.  I'm like, all right, this is yours.  I had to pile it into my little Honda Accord.  This brings back memories.  And I could barely see as I'm driving down the road because I have so much shit. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  And then I have to go to the gig and set it up, and I was never that good at that, so  I was always stressed trying to figure it out with the portable speakers and everything.  And then, like, half the people didn't even give a fuck you were there.  Right.  The bar was trying something new, and all of a sudden you had to awkwardly, like, go  on mic and try to get something going.  And then you're dealing with the drunks and stuff.  And then the bar or the establishment would close down.  You had to break down your own equipment.  And then drive all the way back to this guy's house and put it back in his garage. 
[01:47:30]  I fucking hated it.  I more liked when you were giving away roses at the Exxon in Islandia.  Yeah, I love that.  That was great.  And I'd come driving up in my Apollo work van.  Right.  Boy, what a meeting of the fucking amazing Opie and Anthony radio show those used to be.  I'd pull up in my work van because I heard Opie on the radio, like, fucking going to  be in Islandia at the Exxon station giving away roses.  That's the BAB days, right?  And I'd pull up, and it's like, oh, how you doing?  You know?  And then I, you know, he's giving away roses.  And I had to go off to fucking an attic somewhere.  That was easy, though. 
[01:48:00]  That was easy compared to fucking setting up mobile DJ equipment.  Oh, God.  And I hate that.  I was so glad that I actually quit that.  I just couldn't handle it.  I decided I'll just be poor and deal with the money I was making.  Yeah.  Did you rock comment?  No.  Did you ever mobile DJ?  No.  No.  You ever DJ?  No.  No.  And there's guys out there that do it, and they do it very well.  I was absolutely not that guy.  I just fucking hated it.  Troy Kwan.  He can DJ.  Yeah, but he doesn't have to, like, set up his shit. 
[01:48:30]  No.  That's what I mean.  These were low-level, who gives a fuck gigs.  So degraded.  It was.  Because you're a radio guy, and then you go to an event.  Like, you get hired for a birthday party or an anniversary or something, and you see them  from, like, the oldie station or the classic rock station, and they're just spinning dance  music for you.  And didn't you just have to carry crates of records?  All that.  Because it was just records back then when I was doing it.  Wait, tons.  Dude, the amount of equipment I had to pop into my Honda Accord.  Now you get a fucking computer, a little laptop, and you're fucking spinning. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, I'm a DJ.  I'm a DJ.  I fucking have a laptop, and I press the fucking button.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That's fucked up right there, yo.  You're mad that the Peter Noonan guy?  Peter Noon.  Peter Noonan?  It's just Noon.  Noon.  Peter Noon guy has a show here, too.  It's sad.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  It's so annoying, isn't it?  As long as you don't spend any time trying to figure out how to do a radio show, like,  as long as you don't work in radio, you've got a pretty good shot at getting a show here. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Like, if you've got any notoriety for doing anything, whether you at one point were a  singer.  As long as it's not radio.  As long as it's not radio, then you can get a show.  Then you get a show.  And let me tell you the other side of it, because now that he's our pal.  Denny.  Denny does everything for that fucking show and gets paid nothing.  Of course.  And they just give Peter Noon the big fucking fat paycheck.  Well, yeah.  Because he's the name.  You've got to get the radio guys to produce these shows.  Right.  And they pretend that they're not miserable.  So they get the actual radio guy that knows what the fuck he's doing that could do exactly 
[01:50:00]  what Peter Noon's doing, by the way.  Better.  But because Peter Noon has the name, he gets the big fucking paycheck.  And then, you know, Denny, all fucked up on tequila, has to put the show together.  But, like, Marky Ramon has a show.  It's just because he's, like, the last running Ramon.  Ramon, yeah.  And I know it goes into...  They don't come cheap, those guys.  I know it goes into Marky Ramon's show.  I know what Marky does, and I know what his producer does.  Because I talk to his producer.  Yeah.  What does Marky do?  Marky shows up and says what, literally word for word, what his producer tells him to. 
[01:50:30]  And then they mix it together.  And then he has to go back and make it sound like something.  Right.  But he's not sitting...  He's out of here.  He's not sitting there listening to the songs, waiting for it to end so he could pop in.  No.  I don't think he knows a single one.  Uh-huh.  Like, these specialty DJs, they do maybe an hour's work a week.  Yeah, they go into a studio, they record some lines, and then a producer...  And then the actual radio guy has put the whole thing together.  Puts it together, pieces it together, like a puzzle.  But you don't even need that much notoriety. 
[01:51:00]  You could launch a popular website.  Yeah.  And you'll get a radio show if you want one.  If you want one.  Buzzfeed.  Whoever.  You know who I like?  You know who I like?  I like the fucking original VJs that they got here.  Because I'll see, like, fucking Mark Goodman out by the computers.  And he's actually doing some work.  Right.  No, he's not.  I don't know what it is, but he's doing something.  There's nothing new that comes out of the 80s.  But he's there on the computer.  What kind of work could it be?  He's on the computer.  He's announcing people who've died.  Oh, you think he's just looking up obituaries for fucking 80s guys? 
[01:51:30]  Let me make sure this guy's still alive.  Fucking, yeah, yeah.  Oh, is fucking, what's his name, Tommy Two-Tone dead?  Yeah, he is.  Let me see what happened to the 8-6-7-5-3-0-9 guy.  Yeah.  Tommy Two-Tone's dead.  Oh, he's done?  Yep.  That's too bad.  Or like, hey.  I've been waiting for that second hit for a while.  Yeah.  Yo, hey, come on in.  Hey.  Why are they walking by?  Hey.  Come in.  Oh, come on.  At least say hi.  Oh, come on.  What's the matter?  Come in and say hi. 
[01:52:00]  Come on.  Ah.  It's Tequila and Donut Friday.  It's Tequila and Donut Friday.  But who, because he said?  Because E-Rock said?  Hey, we got Danny to do a shot.  Because you said.  I never said that.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Because you said.  Did you have tequila yet?  Because it sounds like that.  Nah, nah, nah.  Because you said.  I never said it was Tequila Friday.  By the way.  How about one shot?  No.  You know one shot won't do much.  No, no.  We got Danny to do a shot.  Rich, you're going to do one, right?  I'll do a shot if someone else does one.  Just so what.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  And by the way.  You're looking at Rich Davis. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  The last person to work in radio to get a radio show.  Rich Davis, everybody.  That's true.  That's true.  Last person.  Last one.  The next person.  An actual radio guy that got a radio show.  Now, if you had some kind of a singing career.  Right.  Maybe you were an actor.  Maybe you're an airline pilot.  Any other profession besides radio.  You get a radio gig now.  Every job I, every radio job I left, I was replaced by automation or like a celebrity  host.  A celebrity host.  Right, right.  Nicole's body language is saying, I ain't doing no fucking tequila. 
[01:53:00]  I know.  I mean, that makes me nervous right now.  Oh, no.  You want a bump?  Nicole, it's tequila Friday.  I thought you were, come on, tequila Friday.  I thought you were a party girl.  I am.  I'm not feeling good.  Well, that's why it's tequila and donut day.  What?  You don't like the smell of tequila?  This is E-Rock's fifth shot of tequila.  Yeah.  Threw the teeth over the gums.  He's going to be throwing up later.  E-Rock's fifth shot of tequila and donut Friday.  I hope you don't get fired. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, well.  Fired?  I will.  He goes, I will.  Can't get fired for this.  All right, there goes the morning mashup.  Morning mashup.  The show's all about you guys, by the way.  The other two.  Yeah, fuck them.  Fuck them.  Look at her Uggs.  They're giant.  Oh, I thought you meant her feet.  Her Uggs.  Yeah, she's got Uggs on even when she's not wearing Uggs.  I thought she was walking around barefoot.  If you were in Uggs before they were cool.  Yeah, if E-Rock gets fired, maybe they'll replace the host of The Weekend Countdown with  somebody who wrote an interesting article in Cosmo. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  You're a little bitter, Sam.  You're too young to be bitter.  Maybe the guy who played with Billy Joel.  That kid could have a show?  Anthony, don't even fuck around, because they would give him a show in a heartbeat.  Which channel would he get?  Al Q.  Yeah, he could be on any channel.  If he's like, oh, you know I'm a Bruce fan?  Oh, how would you like to do a daily show on the Bruce channel?  Oh, okay.  All right.  I saw the Al Q guys, they were walking down the long hall, heard the commotion, and I  saw them both turn around.  I don't know if it had anything to do with us, but I'm thinking people are now starting 
[01:54:30]  to avoid our tequila donut day.  Is this getting talk scuttlebutt around the building, much like Kenny's walking us to  the bathroom thing?  I think so.  E-Rock and me are both, during the breaks, going spot to spot, looking for people.  Looking for people that want to participate.  You know this show likes a good list.  I think we've got to start a list for Tequila and Donut Day.  Get on that, Schindler.  You start working on that list.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to get Rich Vossen here next. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe we can knock him off that pesky sobriety.  Have him do a fucking shot.  And also, we're going to do the Scott and Todd audio that our own E-Rock.  This could bump up the total grade, the audio.  Are you going to go for a total grade?  Well, the written portion of his presentation got a D, as we know, before, and he's now...  Tequila Donut Day, you gave it a solid B. Where are we at now, though?  You might have to be upping that to a B+.  Dude, with the amount of people that are coming in, the festive party atmosphere, the amount  of donuts that have been eaten... 
[01:55:30]  You can't give an A officially yet.  I'm giving it a strong B+.  Strong B+.  Strong B+.  Now, the audio portion of your...  The tequila and donut day list has begun with the takers.  Sex Man has done five shots.  Five shots.  Denny, the golden voice of series and film, has done three shots.  Stinky has done one shot, and Rick...  Rich Davis.  Sorry, Rich Davis.  Is he the Rich from Covino and Rich?  Yes, he is.  Oh, I didn't know that.  But that's the trick. 
[01:56:00]  I didn't even want to bring that up to him.  Right.  Even because he works in radio, to get a nice paycheck, they make him do a morning and an  afternoon show.  Two shows.  He's got to do the two.  But do you realize...  The Herman Hermits guy, one hour a week.  Yeah.  And I guarantee he makes way more money than...  Do you realize if he was a software mogul, how much he could make in radio?  By getting his own show on Sirius Tech or something?  Do they have that?  They would create Sirius Tech.  What about Roland?  Oh, Roland did a shot.  Oh, Rolando did a shot. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  But he did his own tequila, because he's, of course, always promoting.  The Clooney.  He was promoting George Clooney's tequila.  I hear I have a bottle of the Clooney tequila waiting for me, which I will bring home, and  this evening I might have to partake, you know, when you're supposed to drink.  At night.  Dan's telling everyone that.  On a Friday night.  Yeah, and that's coming from me.  Not at work.  All right.  No.  Morning mashup is coming back down the hall.  Should we ask him again?  Stanley T might be good for...  Nah.  Oh, Stanley T ain't going to drink. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, we don't got the right liquor for him.  Oh, shit.  Stanley T!  All right.  We're doing the other one.  One more.  Yeah, let's go.  One more.  Why don't you offer people, maybe this is a better angle, Mexican coffee.  Like, coffee with a shot of tequila.  That might be good.  Well, we have coffee tequila.  E-Rock, why don't you break out the other tequila?  It's about time.  All right.  We have the coffee tequila.  Coffee flavored tequila.  There's some coffee tequila.  I can't.  I wish we could.  No?  No.  Ah, shit.  Breakfast tequila.  A little breakfast tequila.  It's good stuff.  You guys eat tequila eggs donuts. 
[01:57:30]  That's what's wrong with you guys.  It's like fucking donuts.  It's tequila.  They got the real deal, though.  Tequila donut.  Yeah, it's a Patron.  Patron's some good shit right there.  Is that why all these rappers are lined up out here?  Yeah.  All right, Stanley T.  Oh, man.  Nice ass.  Looking more and more like a black nerd these days, Stanley T.  What's that about?  He really is.  He's going for the nerd look.  Look at Rich.  Looks like a bum.  He looks like a vagabond or something.  He looks like he's from another fucking era.  Yeah, he does.  He looks like a thug from the fucking 30s. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  Yeah, he's got his little hat.  All right, we're going to break at Rich Voss in here.  It's seeping through.  Uh-oh.  Is the lid off your water?  How are you feeling, Iraq?  What's up?  Iraq, what's up?  Get on mic there.  I feel nice.  Just nice?  You feel nice.  Yeah, but like black slang, like I'm nice right now.  Dude, he did five shots of tequila in one hour.  This only started an hour ago.  That means we've got to bring Denny back.  Denny.  Denny.  Denny.  Denny.  So what are your plans once you leave here and go home today? 
[01:58:30]  Drive, drive.  Yeah, what are you going to do after the show?  Because you're going to have the big crash.  You're going to like sneak off somewhere and sleep it off a little bit.  Did you have plans for Friday night with the wife, maybe?  Friday night.  No, not tonight, no.  What are you going to do?  What would be a good Friday night for you that D-Rock has no plans?  What?  It will probably be movies, go to sleep.  Yeah?  Nothing exciting.  No?  Play with video games? 
[01:59:00]  No.  How is he not more fucked up?  I'm a little confused.  He is.  He's trying not to talk a lot.  If you notice, there's a lot of one and two answer fucking, one and two word answers here.  Let's have him read something.  He just tapped himself on the nose.  He barely made it.  Do you want E-Rock to do the live read?  Oh.  That's a great idea.  That's a wonderful idea.  E-Rock, comment.  We have a live read right now?  Yeah.  I'll do this one.  They'll probably...  We could do it in show, right?  Yeah, that's not a problem.  Let her rip, man.  All right, E-Rock. 
[01:59:30]  E-Rock, a live read if you would.  Ah!  You're all leathered up, ready to shave, and you realize you forgot to buy blades.  Now you're stuck digging through the trash for that old blade that zombied out your face  yesterday, or you're one step away from stealing your wife's lady razor.  This is your Dollar Shave Club moment.  Dollar Shave Club is for guys who routinely forget to buy or simply hate selling, simply 
[02:00:00]  hate shelling out for blades.  So here's what the Dollar Shave Club buzz is all about.  Everyone buys razor blades, right?  Buzz.  Well, brand name razor companies nail you.  They build them with 10 blades, a vibrating handle, and a built-in back scratcher.  You end up paying up the wazoo for them.

He's a veteran, though, of drunk.  Yeah.  This isn't Iraq's first time at the rodeo.  He's getting nice, though. 
[02:01:00]  Nice.  He's getting nice.  How do you feel?  Nice.  All right, Rich Voss coming in next as we continue Tequila and Donut Day.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Dirty old town.  Dirty old town.  Oh, that's right.  It's also Irish Music Day.  Big St. Paddy's Day Parade Saturday, right, Denny?  That's right.  It's always good to call him St. Patrick, you know? 
[02:01:30]  St. Patrick.  St. Patrick.  We don't call him St. Joey.  We don't call him St. Chrissy's.  St. Christopher.  You have to be, you have to respect.  Now, can you talk up maybe an Irish record for us?  Hey, we have the Irish Rovers in there and the Unicorns.  For those of you that just joined us, Dennis works with the 60s and some of the music channels.  We call it the Decades.  The Decades channels.  And Cousin Brucie.  And Cousin Brucie.  And that's why earlier we played some Vanilla Fudge and we were just getting into the whole vibe of the 60s music. 
[02:02:00]  You ever just kick back in a bubble bath, maybe with a significant other, just listening to the 60s, drinking a little wine?  Like your dad.  Do you do that?  In the Poconos in the...  In the Poconos?  In the champagne glasses?  The champagne glasses.  The giant champagne glasses with the bubbles?  We couldn't write...  Oh, that's romantical.  We couldn't write a better character than Denny.  I know.  You know that, right, Sam?  Of course.  So you want to talk about what record for St. Patrick's Day?  How about the Unicorn?  You got the Unicorn? 
[02:02:30]  Irish Roac?  Wasn't that a party, Dave?  Wasn't that a party?  That's a good one.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Listen.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I also want to tell people it's tequila and donut day.  I don't know why, but it is.  Iraq surprised us with this today.  I thought it was going to be a complete bust and I am completely wrong.  Here's what I think.  Iraq had a tough night and wanted to get drunk.  And so he made up, his refrigerator broke.  And Rich Voss is in here and he brought his A material, so watch out.  Watch out.  He was bashing us before the mics even went on. 
[02:03:00]  Whoa.  Man, he's got a couple zingers in.  If Iraq does another shot, Denny will.  Denny, would you do another shot?  You're three shots in.  Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  I think we ought to call him T-Rock today.  That's right.  For tequila.  T-Rock.  Oh, T-Rock.  Well, let's let him talk up some records before we do that.  T-Rock, coma.  T-Rock.  Well, it's only 840, 20 till 9.  Do you guys do double time checks?  You should do that.  They're called double time checks?  Double time checks, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  I love them.  840, 20 till 9.  And that's called the double time check.  The smooth voice is wonderful.  I'm surprised you guys don't stand up.  You get a lot of better energy.  Do you normally stand when you're broadcasting?  Yeah.  But he only talks 20 seconds an hour.  Imagine standing for four fucking hours.  We talk four hours every morning there, Denny.  Here's what our breaks would be.  Yo, my legs are tired.  How about yours?  Yeah, fucking exhausted.  I'm getting that twitchy thing in my kneecap.  We really don't care what our voices are like.  Fucking Denny looks like the guy in Beetlejuice after he got his head shrunk. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, man, Rich.  Rich.  Coming from a 30s gangster, that's quite the insult.  Is that a Burberry hat?  Huh?  Is that a Burberry hat?  No, it's fucking Marshalls.  Go fuck it.  Marshalls?  I was going to say it.  It's nice.  Yeah, it is Burberry.  Can I see your hat?  No, you can't see it.  Damn it!  Can we do tequila shots at your hat?  Where's the Irish Rovers?  Oh, of course.  The Irish Rovers.  Come on.  Denny's running the show.  I got that on my hard drive of hits, you know.  You want to do one of my hard drive of hits? 
[02:04:30]  I love this guy!  What's a hard drive of hits?  Well, it's all the music that I carry for my weekend gigs.  Yeah, I understand, but why call it the hard drive of hits?  Because I have all the music.  You remember albums, having to take albums to the gigs, right?  We used to put them in the milk crates.  In the milk crates.  We used to put them on the hair truck and bring them in.  And what a pain in the ass, right?  You had to do it, you know.  You had to bring the right music.  And every time you would take out the album, it's like somebody...  You say, you know, I haven't played George Thorogren in a while.  I'm not going to need it.  The next day, some guy goes, hey, you got Born to be Bad? 
[02:05:00]  You know, I just played it just before you got here.  Damn, that's smart.  I just picked up the Bangladesh album.  Bangladesh.  He still can't say Bangladesh.  You can't dance to Bangladesh.  You can't dance to Bangladesh.  When you advertise, Denny, when you advertise, do you advertise with Denny comes the hard drive of hits?  No, they just get it.  That is pretty good.  I can see that on a banner.  That's pretty terrific.  What's your selling point?  Denny and the hard drive hits.  It's just the personality.  You know, I just keep the music going.  Do you have a slug line?  I play the music. 
[02:05:30]  I just make the music better.  Do you say, I let the music do the talking?  We let the music do the talking.  We play the music that you want.  Oh.  Because, Sam, you and your wife, you and your future wife.  No, I'm married.  We're almost a year now.  You guys are the main customers, so you guys tell me the songs to play.  More importantly, the songs you don't want me to play.  Yeah.  Oh.  Like, we've been to 88 weddings.  We don't want to hear Celebration.  Right.  1980 hit music by Cool and the Gang.  Put back that ass up back on.  Something like that.  Well, I don't play any music with any suggestive music. 
[02:06:00]  That's a little blue.  Because we've got the kids.  Right, the kids.  You've got to think of the kids.  He doesn't work blue, Ed.  He doesn't work blue.  So he wants to talk about what?  The unicorn.  Do you want to do that, or wasn't that a party?  Yeah, wasn't that a party?  Okay.  We can do two.  We can do a twofer.  Scott and Todd play that every Friday.  Whoa!  After that, he'll talk up niggas in Paris.  No, no, that's just not.  No, Denny?  No.  Is the N-word part of your vocabulary?  No, you can't use it, because we've got communion season coming up.  Plus, they shouldn't be in Paris.  You know there's communion season. 
[02:06:30]  I don't know anything.  Yeah, it's busy.  Sometimes we'll be doing two jobs in one day.  It gets crazy.  It gets crazy.  You're DJ at the communions, right?  Yeah, we bring the hula hoops, the limbo pole.  And your fucking...  Musical chairs.  Do you bring them out?  Like, hey, let's bring out the brand new...  Do you also bring a noose?  Because I'm fucking having my son.  It's got to be fun.  Dude, look what Denny used to look like.  There you go.  You like the mustache and everything?  What the fuck, Denny?  What year is that?  That would be 1989.  1989. 
[02:07:00]  Ushering in the new decade.  That was in Brooklyn.  I think I was playing Donna Summer.  This time I know it's for real.  Oh.  He knows what he was playing.  Music to go-go.  For all occasions.  Is it still the same phone number?  No.  Oh.  No.  Well, what's your...  Do you want to get to the...  DennisFalcone.com.  I just keep it nice and simple.  Are you related to Rob Falcone?  No.  You remember Pete Falcone used to pitch for the Mets?  No.  I'm not related to him either.  That's a good one.  He's got to be funny, too, when he's doing this. 
[02:07:30]  He is funny.  He really is.  He's a great guy.  Well, you know what?  After a slow dance, I always say,  now make sure you give that person you're dancing with  a nice big hug and a kiss.  And then I take a beat, and I go,  make sure you introduce yourself.  Because they couldn't be dancing with somebody who...  We're trying to figure that out.  That gets them all the time.  We're trying to figure that out.  That gets them all the time.  This is not a character.  No, no, no.  This is great.  I love this guy.  I loved him on the Munsters.  He was...  Oh, jeez. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, Rich.  You've got to.  Trying to make yourself feel better, aren't you?  All right.  Let's have a talk up an Irish song.  Let's have a talk up one of our Irish songs for St. Patrick's Day.  Which one do you want?  Unicorn or what?  St. Patrick's Day.  I said we do both.  It's a unicorn.  Double shot.  Unicorn?  Let's do a unicorn first.  Two in a row is the way to go.  Don't forget to praise this weekend.  You can work that into the fucking talk up here.  That's right.  Tell me when you want it.  Hey, it's the 60s on 6.  Let's go back inside with the Irish Rovers.  Make sure you bring your umbrella tomorrow because it could rain.  Oh, I stepped on it.  You stepped on it. 
[02:08:30]  Danny.  Oh, man.  That's okay.  I would just say morning.  Is that what you say when you step on something?  Morning.  Morning.  Give me the other one.  Give me the other one.  Give me the other one.  Watch how he rolls up his sleeve.  Come on now.  I love it.  Here you go.  It's his thing.  Good.  These are the Rovers that used to be known as the Irish Rovers.  But, baby, we are having a party.  Perfect.  That's good, man.  That was right on the money.  I remember this from my Geneseo days. 
[02:09:00]  Great song.  Everybody get those hands up.  Yeah.  I thought you really meant it.  That's pretty good.  Everybody here is Irish today.  Oh.  We're all Irish today.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  So we should be drinking, then.  Well, Iraq should.  All right.  Go back to our list, Sam.  Have you added to the list?  Well, right now, it's Tequila and Donut Day in the No Thanks column.  Right.  We're at Nicole, Stan, and probably the OutQ guys. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  And Opie and Anthony, believe it or not.  Well, yeah.  Add us to the list.  You've got to get some guys from the sports channels.  Yeah.  They're big drinkers.  They're big drinkers.  The football guys want to come in.  I am.  And Taylor from Cosmo, they're coming in at 9 o'clock when they're done.  Yeah.  All right.  We might need another bottle of tequila.  Well, we've got the coffee.  Taylor can party.  She hangs out with Nicole.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is she the one with the rough voice?  Yep.  She gets somebody from the country channels because they have that hit called Pour Me Another 
[02:10:00]  Tequila, Sheila.  Do you want to talk that one up?  Is that a guy?  I don't know that one.  He doesn't know country very much, right?  He's not a big country guy.  I like country.  Oh, who doesn't?  I like the country crossovers.  Is that Eddie Rabbit?  Crossover hits.  You don't play character no matter where you're working.  This isn't a character.  You know, I work with companies who do the characters, too.  Yeah.  Like we have Mickey Mouse.  You can't call him Barney.  Call him the Purple Dinosaur because of infringement.  Yeah, yeah.  Because of infringement.  Like, I could see you doing, like, my mom's nursing home where they're just all fucking,  like, drooling and all out of... 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  They love that.  They love the music.  Yeah, I know.  You know what?  It's not like I go out there and every DJ today just brings hip-hop music.  Yeah, I know.  But I bring the hits.  I bring...  Do you finger-pop any of the old broads when they're not looking?  Tom Jones.  No.  All the good songs.  Barry Manilow.  Oh, no.  Like, there was a guy that did Sinatra hits at my mom's nursing home.  And let me tell you...  He sings?  Uh...  What happened?  I don't know.  Like, computers fucking up on me here.  Oh.  No, he plays the hits.  What did you say he rocked?  I have Pour Me Another Tequila if he wants that one. 
[02:11:00]  No, I really don't know that one, but you know what?  We could play that for all the guys on the country channel.  Well, play it anyway.  All right.  Watch it.  What's the ramp time on there?  You got an intro time?  Oh, it's called the ramp time.  Nope.  You'll have to figure it out.  All right.  You can figure it out.  You're a pro, Danny.  You're a pro.  I guess so.  All right.  Let's do this for Tequila and Donut Day.  It's Tequila and Donut Day here on the O&A Show on a Friday.  A frantic Friday as we have one great song after another.  And Pour Me Another Tequila, Sheila, here on the countryside.  We've still got some ramp time here. 
[02:11:30]  We've still got some ramp time here.  So ramp time.  How many seconds was it?  I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention.  Yeah, but you could have figured it out for good old Denny.  I don't care of shit.  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  It comes around twice.  Show prep.  What's on this weekend?  We got show prep right here in this bottle, Denny.  That's right, Denny.  A bottle full of prep.  Some lifestyle stuff.  People going to the movies this weekend.  Oh, what's going to be...  What's on the movies?  That Magician movie comes out this weekend, Wonderstone. 
[02:12:00]  And it's St. Patrick's Day.  It's St. Patrick's Day.  And it's, let's see...  And it's Tequila Friday, for God's sake.  Tequila and Donut Day.  41 years ago today, The Godfather premiered.  41?  Did there's something on that?  Nah, not really.  No.  That's not something to really talk about.  Friday and Saturday, Rich Floss at McGuire's in Bohemia.  With Joe Curry is going to be joining you.  Yes, the wonderful and talented Joseph T. Curry.  My friend Joe Curry, yes.  Indeed.  You want a donut?  Oh, thanks. 
[02:12:30]  I had a bite.  You did?  Yeah.  So you're partaking?  What is that?  The LIE exit 58?  I don't know.  I'm not MapQuest.  I'm just going out there.  I don't know what you...  It's Bohemia.  Do you know where it is?  Yeah, sure.  Right up the LIE.  Yeah, 58.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that's right after Vets Highway.  Veterans Highway.  Veterans Highway.  I'm a Jersey guy.  Traffic backing up right now around there.  You're going to be tapping the brakes as you come up to exit 56.  There you go.  Yeah.  Make sure you slow down.  Yeah, slow down.  Watch yourself.  As I look out of the helicopter view, I'm seeing a lot of diamonds and rubies on the highway. 
[02:13:00]  I did that once.  They wanted to make me a helicopter reporter.  Whoa.  And we did a little...  It was like a prop plane.  I mean, it was small.  And I went up there, and after a while, that thing just shakes like anything.  Yeah.  And I threw up.  You threw up in the airplane?  They said, all right, come on in, Dennis.  And then the pilot gets on, you guy threw up.  You guy threw up.  That's an old school pilot.  And you have to sit there with the mess on you until back to the airplane. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Danny.  Danny.  Yeah.  You don't want to talk about that here on The Breakfast Hour.  No.  See, people are eating right now.  You want to keep it light.  Nice.  Especially when they're taking tequila shots with their breakfast.  There's something called The Breakfast Hour?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Five to nine.  They're not a clock, then they get into the office.  Who's the guy sitting outside there?  Is that the guy that wants to have a shot?  That's Dave LaGreca from the NFL show.  Oh, yeah.  He wants to have a shot.  He wants to have a shot.  E-Rock, get on in here.  E-Rock.  Tequila Friday.  Tequila Donuts Friday.  I am out of here. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  What's up, boys?  What's up, brother?  What's happening?  Dennis is going out.  He's back to the music stations.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Pleasure to meet you.  Absolutely.  You're welcome to meet me in your studio.  Yeah, right?  Please.  Dave LaGreca hosts the wrestling show here on Series.  Oh, very cool, man.  He has a really lousy co-host, but he's good.  Who's the co-host?  I don't know.  What's his name?  Doug Mortman.  He's not crazy.  He's very good.  Have you been talking about Fandango? 
[02:14:30]  Fandango.  You've got to do it right here or he's not going to wrestle.  I'm trying or he doesn't wrestle.  You've got to let the A's breathe in.  We're in the twilight zone today.  Fandango.  He tweeted me.  He tweeted you.  Yes, he did.  That's fucking pretty good.  I'm all in with the Fandango.  You're not saying it right.  So where's the tequila?  Ah, yeah.  Right there.  E-Rock, come on up here.  You're not a good host.  You'll even open bottles of tequila in front of Rich Voss.  That's wonderful.  I'd even...  It didn't faze me.  If it was cracked, then there'd be another story.  Oh, okay. 
[02:15:00]  Why don't you have Crack Friday?  And another one, baby.  E-Rock's poured another one for us.  E-Rock.  You're going to have to alter your list, of course.  This will be E-Rock's sixth shot of tequila.  E-Rock is on number six.  So what donut goes with tequila?  That's really up to you.  We're running out of choices there.  I think something chocolatey is good.  No, he doesn't like sweets.  Or the apple-filled even is kind of nice with the tequila.  So do you eat the donut first?  How do you do it?  Do you take a bite and then E-Rock? 
[02:15:30]  I think what you do is you first take the sugar donut.  You lick the sugar.  You do the shot of tequila and you bite into the donut.  Okay, hold on.  Let me try this.  Yeah, yeah.  Lick the sugar.  There you go.  Now the shot of tequila.  Now you bite the donut.  There it is.  Not bad.  It works that way.  That was good, man.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, you know, screw it.  Who needs lime and salt?  Now let me try it.  Fandango.  That works.  That works.  We'd be watching him wrestle right now if he heard you say that. 
[02:16:00]  And what are you doing right now for the NFL channel?  Producing.  Just producing?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  The show goes on.  I'm a good producer.  I can just leave the studio and eat donuts and drink tequila.  I don't know how this happened, but E-Rock came up with a slam dunk idea today.  Speaking of slam dunk, it's going to be one more for the sex man right now.  E-Rock.  Huh?  This will be your sixth.  Making a nice even six.  How are you feeling, E-Rock?  Nice round number.  How are you feeling?  I'm feeling toasty. 
[02:16:30]  Were you in the bathroom before?  No, I was in there running the commercials and bringing us back on break.  No, it sucks.  When was the last time you went to the bathroom?  Were you there?  When you were looking for me.  Oh, okay, because I heard somebody splash water on their face and go, oh, in the bathroom  and I thought it was you.  Oh, okay.  Because you're bosses.  Yeah.  You know what sucks?  What?  Sam's going to get the drunk E-Rock and Ron Efez is going to get the drunk E-Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm looking forward to that after show today.  Oh, I bet.  Yeah.  Because right when it kicks in, we're out of here. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  There he goes.  Another shot.  Gulp it down.  He's looking a little.  There it goes.  And it's down.  I just got goosebumps just watching that.  All right, Big Dave.  Anything else you want to say, Big Dave?  That's it, Dave.  I appreciate it.  Big Dave.  That's the first time I've been called Big Dave.  My ex-wife never called me Big Dave.  Oh, hey.  Watch out.  Watch out.  Hey, hey.  You put the tequila and the sugar donut.  I appreciate it.  Not in the breakfast hour.  Don't be talking about that. 
[02:17:30]  It's a little too blue.  A little too blue.  That talk is a little too blue.  What's the ramp time on this one?  I still have some ramp time left there.  Don't touch, guys.  But listen to Busted Open.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's not 82XM2A.  Thanks for that.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.  Were you one of the gentlemen that actually went to the Super Bowl this year?  Yes.  Son of a bitch!  That makes it.  It goes well.  But wrestling and football goes well.  Of course it does.  Of course it does.  LT.  Nice.  Take it easy, sir.  All right, Big Dave.  Very nice.  LaGreca.  This is going so much better than I thought it would. 
[02:18:00]  Absolutely.  Awesome.  It's awesome.  I thought this was going to be a total bomb.  Just E-Rock doing shots alone.  But other people.  Who's coming in next?  The Cosmo Broad.  It's almost 9 o'clock.  Taylor from Cosmo.  We'll be here about 9 o'clock.  Oh, a young lady.  Should we break so that we can get a clear the field for Taylor?  Clear the field, even us up with the time.  We still haven't played the audio that we meant to play at 10 to 7.  Oh, E-Rock's audio.  Right, right. 
[02:18:30]  It's an E-Rock day today.  I can't believe it's 9 o'clock because I know we have done nothing.  This is what happened.  But I love...  Time travel?  Give the show to E-Rock.  I love Denny because radio is a craft for those guys.  Dude, he is amazing.  What did he call the time check?  Double time check.  Double time check.  Double time check.  Double time check.  8.40, 20 to 9.  And I love when if he does error, he's got a way to recover from it.  It's not just, oh, shit, I made a mistake.  He's just like, oh, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Morning.  Morning.  Morning.  Morning all.  And it's smooth, too.  Everything's smooth.  He was doing radio when there was only like four stations, right?  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, yeah, back in the day.  I heard he didn't know.  He doesn't look that old, though.  No, he's not that old.  There's still guys like that out there.  Yes, E-Rock.  He's raising his hand now.  Oh, my God.  What's that about?  I've never seen him raise his hand before.  E-Rock.  No, you got a lot.  You'll see this on my radio podcast, talking to these old guys because you make fun of them  for what they do on the air, but they have tons of stories of people doing heroin and 
[02:19:30]  coke and fights at these radio stations back in the 60s and 70s.  Is he plugging a show that doesn't exist?  What's he talking about?  It's coming.  I'm not plugging.  I'm just relating it to this.  Rich, you've got competition.  He's about to launch four podcasts.  Four E-Rock podcasts.  Good.  Oh, you're going to host your own network?  Simpsons.  E-Rock stories.  E-Rock growing up.  What's the fourth one?  E-Rock radio.  E-Rock radio.  Good.  I trashed some guy on the road in a radio station who was going by the name E-Rock. 
[02:20:00]  I go, you can't use E-Rock.  No, you can't use E-Rock.  Some kid in Arizona, I go, there's already an E-Rock.  So I beat him down.  Good.  Change your goddamn name.  You should know.  One goddamn E-Rock.  They just pounded it out.  That's what we do.  That's what we do.  E-Rock's feeling it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, buddy.  Are you feeling it now?  Yeah, buddy.  It's there.  He's getting too hot to wear your hat.  At least close.  Too hot for the hat.  Too hot for the hat.  Yeah.  Today on the after show, E-Rock, you're in this studio with me right next to me, buddy. 
[02:20:30]  Shit.  You're going to run the board.  I don't care.  We don't need anyone to run the board.  Sal is.  Sal proves that.  To me and you in here today.  Sal usually comes in and sits in there.  Yeah, he does nothing.  He's never contributed to anything.  He doesn't even know what we're doing today.  No.  Do you now know what we're doing, Sal?  Yeah, I just missed the interval of time when I was out.  That's not even interesting.  A little response is like a snooze.  It's only been five seconds.  That was ramp time. 
[02:21:00]  Should we get Taylor in here or she needs a few minutes?  Why don't we take a break?  I'll check on Taylor.  All right.  Why don't we do that?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a fucked up show today.  We got Rich Voss in the studio.  We're doing Irish music today and we're also doing tequila and donuts. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know.  Let's go to the scoreboard, Sam.  Okay.  Right now with the no thanks is Nicole, Stan, probably the out cue guys, and the rest of  the O and A show.  Right.  The takers have been Big Dave LaGreca from NFL Radio.  One shot.  Rich Davis from the mashup.  One shot.  Stinky.  Stinky!  One shot.  The road dog, Roland.  One shot.  One shot.  That's surprising.  Third place is up for grabs right now. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  Just one of those guys has to step up and they get the bronze today.  Or somebody walks in here and does a couple shots, automatically third place.  Good fucking point, Sam Roberts.  Denny, however, is solid in second with three shots.  He's working on his ramp time as we speak.  Ramp time?  He realizes he's a little rusty.  He's working on the ramp time.  Yeah.  And he was unhappy with his double time check a minute ago.  He was.  He was a little unhappy with that?  A little unhappy with that.  But solid.  Number one, first place with a bullet. 
[02:22:30]  At six shots.  Oh, man.  Is the creator of Tequila and Donut Day, the sex man, Eric Nagel.  Yeah.  Eric, to you.  How you feeling, buddy?  How you feeling?  I can feel my teeth.  Shooter Nagel.  Nice.  You can feel his teeth, ladies and gentlemen.  And we're playing Dropkick Murphy's Kiss Me, I'm Shit-Faced.  Oh, my God.  That's for you, I guess.  In an hour, fight!  Rich Voss is playing McGuire. 
[02:23:00]  He's out there on Long Island this weekend.  Starting tonight.  Tonight and tomorrow night.  Then I head to Vegas to the MGM Grand next week.  The MGM Grand.  Yes.  Damn.  I like that place.  Yeah, that's nice.  It's not a wide hotel.  I've stayed there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's nice.  I've never been there.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, it's really nice.  Nice.  Yeah, check out the Tigers.  Do they have the Tigers still?  I think they do, sure.  And then they got that big pool fucking complex out back.  Brand new, more or less.  Oh, it's fucking beautiful.  Only a few years old, right?  Yep. 
[02:23:30]  Yep.  Looks like Atlantis down there.  Vegas is good for like three days, but after a week, you just feel dirty and beaten down.  Who would go there for a week?  Someone would have to spend a nice little weekend there.  You have to be there a week?  Monday through Sunday.  What?  At the MGM at the Red Garrett Comedy Club there.  And this weekend at McGuire's, which is great.  It's just Friday and Saturday.  Friday and Saturday, McGuire's out there on Long Island.  Go see that.  And Joe Curry, my buddy, he's going to be out there, too, with you.  He'll keep you company.  I like him.  Joe's great. 
[02:24:00]  He's funny, too.  He's a funny, fun guy.  He's funny.  Does he make money at this show?  Probably not.  I'll tell him.  You know, they always fuck over the guys.  Give him a little taste, Rich.  I always do.  I always take care of my openers.  Anything to get him out of the house.  He loves it.  Just get him the fuck out of the house.  Really?  Get him away from his life.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  And it's fucking, yeah.  Is he one of those guys?  I think.  Does he seem like a good time?  Could be.  Seemed like a good time.  Could be.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  Thank you.  Fuck.  It's like Joe. 
[02:24:30]  Poor Joe.  He loves getting out of the house.  Yeah.  Oh, does Joe love it?  He takes gigs.  Like, he'll drive to, like, you know, Harrisburg to do a guest spot.  To do a guest spot.  Just to get the fuck out of his house.  Oh, boy.  Believe that, yo.  He was telling me he was working somewhere.  I go, what the fuck?  Oh, yeah.  And Joe's like, yeah, I'm driving to Ohio.  For what?  To drop off a tape.  To drop off a tape. 
[02:25:00]  Well, what does that got you, Joe?  Out of the house.  Out of the house, guy.  I'm going to Nebraska.  Why?  They spelled my name wrong.  I want to go correct them.  I'm going to go correct them about my name.  I'm going to, yeah, that's it.  Joe loves seeing his driveway get smaller and smaller in his rearview mirror.  It's a good feel.  Like, sometimes I'm sitting home at night, and I'll just, I'll go, I've got to go anywhere.  I've got to go anywhere. 
[02:25:30]  I've got to go anywhere.  Just get the fuck out.  I've got to go anywhere.  And breathe.  Yeah.  You know, so I'll go, do you want something from 7-Eleven, you know, and then I'll just  drive around, you know, just get, yeah, just like, it's like you're free.  You just need some time to yourself.  That's great.  As a man.  That's like, when you're single like you, you could fucking, you don't have to answer  to anybody.  I was saying the other day that to be able to sit on my couch at any time I want and 
[02:26:00]  turn on a show about hydraulics on the fucking Discovery Channel or something, and watch it  without hearing, what's this?  Eh, this is boring.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  Now fuck that.  I'll tell you what, I'm watching whatever the fuck I want.  I got a Texas one.  I, like, I go, when I do, you guys, or a lot of times I'll go sleep downstairs so I  can get up early and leave the house.  Sure.  Okay?  I turn the heat on.  It's fucking freezing.  I get a text.  Oh, thanks for turning the heat on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I like a heated house? 
[02:26:30]  I'm sorry about that.  Okay.  Every night our five-year-old comes and sleeps in our bed between us.  Sure.  Because she snores.  I mean, I didn't mind in the beginning because this way I don't have to be that close to  my wife.  Five-year-old snores?  Unbelievably.  She's like the...  Really?  Yeah, I got to call the doctor.  Steve, if you're listening, should a five-year-old snore?  Ah, wow.  So, and, like, I go downstairs, but the fucking, it's like, you, I mean, don't get me wrong,  I don't envy you in any way.  Well, you shouldn't.  No, of course not. 
[02:27:00]  The one thing is you don't have to answer.  State of denial.  You don't have to answer.  I don't have to answer to anybody.  I love it.  I love not having to answer to anybody.  If I'm fucking, if I'm on the couch and I just decide I want to sleep, I just shut my  eyes and go to sleep.  And, you know, when I wake up, whenever the fuck I want, you can have a party and throw  everybody out, like in The Godfather, or you, get out.  Oh, get out.  Or fucking trading places.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out!  Man, you are the most righteous.  Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out. 
[02:27:30]  Right.  That is great, too.  Man, you are the most righteous.  Get the fuck out.  Come on.  I love that.  What?  No tequilas being drunk.  Or drank.  No.  E-Rock!  Oh, E-Rock!  Oh, E-Rock!  E-Rock, you tapping out at six shots?  No, but it's nice to have somebody else to do it with.  Well, what happened to Taylor from the Cosmo Channel?  Yeah, where's the Cosmo Channel?  Yeah, what's going on?  Taylor, we can't wait around all day. 
[02:28:00]  Taylor, get in here.  We might have to bring Denny back.  Denny, if you're listening, come on back.  Denny, what's he doing over there?  Ramp time?  He's practicing his, uh, yeah.  I see Rolando down there, too.  Yeah, Rolando has been avoiding the tequila for the most part.  Yeah.  Who else is this?  I don't know.  And we also have the E-Rock audio.  Imagine how much trouble we'd get if we forced the interns to drink.  Holy shit.  And then we kicked them all in the balls.  Wow.  That would be stupid.  With our mouths. 
[02:28:30]  With our mouths.  Ah, shit.  Shit.  That's the kid we're trading for right there.  Right there.  Oh, that's the kid, yeah.  We're trading for him.  Sal goes, we get him.  Yes.  And we'll add a fucking mongoloid to be named later.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Denny's coming back down the hall.  Oh, here he comes.  It is after 9 o'clock.  Can't we get some of the other people around here to do it?  Well, it's up to you.  You started tequila and donut day.  I think, you know, Roland should come back.  Maybe Sal. 
[02:29:00]  It's after 9.  Seems acceptable.  Denny's coming back in.  Denny's like the star of the show today.  Yeah.  You like Denny Rich Voss?  Yeah, I like that.  He makes me calm.  He makes me feel calm.  Denny, you want a shot of tequila and the coffee?  I don't like to come in when you've got the on-air light on, though.  He's so technical and professional.  You're so professional.  That's it.  Why?  I mean, that's where I was brought up in this business.  Yeah.  When did you start?  In 1986.  Oh, 1986.  I was doing a job.  I was working at WGBB 1240, the Pulse of Long Island. 
[02:29:30]  I remember it.  And I hosted a show at Hofstra University with Jay Black and the Americans.  And the opening act was Jerry Seinfeld.  Wow.  And the funny thing is, Jerry Seinfeld's dad used to own a sign shop out in Long Island called  Cal Signs.  Signs.  Signs?  Cal Signs.  Oh, that doesn't make sense.  That was Cal Seinfeld.  And sometimes in the TV show, you'll see shots of him walking down the street, and you'll  see a show up there.  You know, a little sign up there.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  Did not notice that.  And I brought Jerry on stage. 
[02:30:00]  Fascinating.  You did?  Yeah, I did.  How'd you do that?  Let us go back.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  If you would, take us back to that moment.  And what is your radio name officially?  I used Dennis Falcone.  I used to use Big Joe.  You know who you used to use?  Chuck Lose.  Big Joe on the go.  Well, because, you see, I worked at a station.  I worked at a station.  There were two guys named Dennis.  And one guy was named Dick.  So I said, well, you can't have two dicks at a radio station.  It's a little blue.  It's a little blue.  A little blue for you, Danny. 
[02:30:30]  So they said, what's your middle name?  So I said, you know, Joseph.  So I used Big Joe.  So I was Big Joe on the go.  Big Joe on the go.  On 1240 Radio.  Radio.  You know, rhyme everything.  It did rhyme.  Oh, so how'd you bring Sonson on stage?  Bring us back to that time.  Do you need music to do it?  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know you're here tonight to see Jay Black in the American.  with all those great hits from the 60s.  We've got some people from the 60s.  Come on.  Let me hear you out there.  Yes.  Thank you.  What did he say?  I can't hear him very well.  We've got a guy.  Maybe you've seen him at the Richard M. Dixon White House. 
[02:31:00]  And I can't get up.  Maybe you've seen him on the Johnny Carson Tonight Show.  He's from right here in the neighborhood.  Anybody from Massapequa?  Come on, everybody.  Put your hands together for Massapequa.  Massapequa.  In the house.  Well, I'm going to bring a guy out.  He's from your backyard.  Maybe you know him.  Maybe you've seen him in ShopRite.  Ladies and gentlemen, come on.  Put your hands together for Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, wait a second, Jerry.  Hold on.  Come on.  It's a Saturday night.  Let me do my hand.  It's a Saturday night.  And I need some energy.  Show this guy some love. 
[02:31:30]  Let me get a nice WGBB welcome.  One more time.  I'll give it to you again.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me hear Jerry Seinfeld.  Come on now.  I just want to come out and do my hand.  What's the matter with me?  There's nothing worse than a long autobiography.  Oh, God.  I took five minutes on Jerry Seinfeld there because all the guys at Hofstra reunion guys  are going, we've got to get out of here at 11.  He's fantastic.  This guy is fantastic.  Rich Voss, the boss.  Very good, Daddy. 
[02:32:00]  Rich Voss, the boss.  Have you heard of me before today?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, good.  Ben, what do you think of him?  I think he's a funny guy.  Thank you.  Funny guy.  I love his voice.  Yeah.  Well, if you ever need me to bring you on stage.  He'll bring you up in case I don't want to do my act.  Are you working during communion season?  What's that?  Are you working during communion season?  That's one of the biggest seasons for me.  It's a big season for comics because I've got to do a lot of private house parties for  communion.  That's good.  I love house parties.  Make sure you show your Jew tattoos at the communion parties.  I come out with a star, David. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Because when I open up a house party, I go, we're going all night.  We're going all night.  No overtime here, baby.  We're going to rock this party all night long.  I fucking swear.  I'm going to be having a party at my house.  You've got to bring that in.  Probably a Memorial Day party.  Some early June kind of party to usher in the summer at my house.  Because dates are filling up soon.  I want him spinning.  You're going to have to book him soon.  I want him spinning.  Maybe an opening of the pool. 
[02:33:00]  Let me tell you.  I'm going to arrange this.  I'm going to get a party put together.  And I want you there to DJ it.  That would be great.  I think it would be fantastic.  He will fucking...  I might put you on the website then and get a little picture of you.  He's fucking classic.  Holy shit.  And if you and your fiance decide to take that next step, let's talk about personalizing  your wedding.  Yeah.  You could do a communion at the same time.  Fiance.  That's...  No, I don't believe this young man's married yet. 
[02:33:30]  I had a fiance once.  She turned into a wife.  And then turned into some fucking mythical creature from hell.  Well, there's this great disc jockey, an oldies disc jockey out of Pittsburgh, Porky  Chedwick.  He said, don't get married.  They won't let you hang around the radio station.  Yeah, Porky.  What a crazy guy.  Porky Chedwick.  Whatever happened to Porky.  You know, sometimes...  You hear a band.  They came through the Philly area.  Three Jacks and a Jill.  They're fantastic.  Yeah, that Master Jack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a straight...  Whatever happened to Porky. 
[02:34:00]  You guys need to know what happened to Porky.  What happened to Porky?  Porky's still alive, but he's still doing it in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  He's a 3WS, I believe.  Tearing up Pittsburgh.  No idea.  Sam, is it tequila time?  Nobody's drinking.  I thought this was a party.  Well, it's E-Rock's party.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Why don't you step up to the bar?  Belly up to the bar.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  There's a lady.  Yes, I see.  We're seeing a lady in the room.  Hi.  Why don't you introduce yourself?  Hi.  I'm Taylor.  Taylor.  I'm from Cosmo Radio.  Cosmo Radio.  I love the voice.  What do you do over there? 
[02:34:30]  I love Taylor's voice.  That is a great Demi Moore kind of voice.  Kind of got a Demi Moore thing happening.  Yeah.  This is my real voice.  This is my pretending to be Demi Moore voice.  It is good.  It's raspy.  Thank you.  It's sexy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How did you get that?  How did you get that voice?  By smoking and taking shots.  Smoking and doing shots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Were you always like a party girl?  No, no, no.  This is actually...  My mom sounds just like me.  If you put us in a room together and close your eyes, you cannot difference.  Is your mom Brenda Vaccaro?  Hey, I'm Brenda Vaccaro. 
[02:35:00]  It tells us on what we're on, on Cosmo Radio.  Yes.  We are competitors.  Oh, why don't you even say that?  We're all one big happy family here.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  And we're probably going for different demos.  Yeah.  As long as they subscribe.  I don't know.  Who knows at this point?  I thought we were going for the exact same demographic.  Yeah.  Who knows?  No, as long as they're subscribing, it doesn't matter what they listen to.  That's the kid we're trading for.  We're getting rid of Sal.  We're getting this kid in a big trade.  What's his name?  What's his name, Sam?  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the microphone.  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes. 
[02:35:30]  Handsome Johnny Tubestakes.  Yes.  His fucking eyes.  I'm torn between him and her.  You're falling in love with his eyes.  I'm telling you, she didn't have the ring, okay?  But he's...  Fuck, he's a 10.  Damn.  How old are you?  24.  24.  Handsome Johnny Tubestake runs his fucking place on the weekends.  I've seen him work, and I want to trade Sal for him.  Is that it?  You don't mind, right, Sal?  No, I want to stay here.  Yeah, but he's in here doing a shot of tequila.  I don't see you fucking stepping up to the plate. 
[02:36:00]  I don't want to drink during the show.  Thus then, why the trade?  Which will go down.  I don't know if I can do seven, though.  I can do one.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's one more than Sal.  Wait, how many are we doing?  As many as you want, Taylor.  No, no, no.  Me?  Oh, it's a competition?  No.  Well, not really.  It's a lot.  We have a friendly competition going on, but no one's going to beat EROC at this point.  You can do two for bronze.  Yeah, if you do two, you're going to be in the third place category, beating out a lot 
[02:36:30]  of guys.  I don't know if that's a great idea.  You got to fly?  You're not the pilot.  Where are you going?  Oh, I am actually the pilot.  No, you're not.  You're not a pilot.  See?  Wait, why are you going to L.A.?  We're flying it up to 35,000 feet.  Why are you going to L.A.?  The smoking light is on in the cockpit.  My husband is running a marathon.  Husband?  Husband.  Get out.  Get out.  I know.  A marathon?  A marathon.  In California?  Well, he was going to run to New York, and then they canceled that, so it was like, 
[02:37:00]  So a lot of these people had to find another marathon.  Yep.  Yeah, so these other marathons are doing very well.  No one gives a fuck.  Why am I explaining this?  How long have you been married?  No one cares, but it is the truth.  A lot of people had to find another marathon.  How long have you been married there?  Two and a half years.  How's it going for you?  Is it better than fucking...  It's annoying.  What about fucking down the hall?  You know how that marriage is.  You?  No.  Oh, Cole?  Nicole.  Oh, I mean, we're best friends, so...  But you know how her marriage is, right?  Yeah, as bad as mine.  Called in the proverbial sheer. 
[02:37:30]  She goes and says, as bad as mine.  What's the problem?  What's your biggest complaint since you've been married?  I just...  You know what?  I get very annoyed by people very easily.  What happened?  So he just annoyed me.  Johnny's got to do a shot.  He's got to go to a meeting.  What?  What meeting have you got?  A.A.  A.A.  A.A.  A.A.  A.A.  A.A.  You guys do your shot, and he's one of the guys running the South by Southwest stuff.  Wow.  Really?  24-7.  Non-stop.  Sal's got a...  Sal's pouting, by the way.  Oh, Iraq's pissed.  Iraq got all drunky, man.  Like, you're not even toasting me, you bitch. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, we're doing this now?  Yeah.  Do it up.  It's warm.  Couldn't we chill this, please?  You'll be chilling after you do the shot.  She's not easy to be married to, either.  Oh, it's warm.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Good one.  All right.  Thank you, handsome Johnny Tube Steaks.  I hated that.  Now, why is Sal pouting, by the way?  I'm not pouting.  At all.  No one likes it.  Because Sal's a worthless piece of shit.  Eric, you said no one likes me.  Why don't you go home and fuck your wife tonight as opposed to getting drunk on the air.  Jesus Christ.  Oh!  What kind of slam is that? 
[02:38:30]  Why don't you go fuck your wife?  Okay.  What the fuck is that?  Why don't you go fuck your wife?  Oh, I guess I will.  You're going to take that?  I think I will.  Are you going to take that?  Are you going to take that, E-Roc?  I think he's implying that you get drunk and pass out instead of fucking your wife.  Oh.  That's the one I took away from that.  Is that what that bash was, Sal?  Well, he said he was going to go home and watch movies.  You look really drunk, by the way.  Taylor.  He is.  You're like glassy-eyed central. 
[02:39:00]  Isn't he so glassy-eyed?  It's so awesome.  He's bedrified.  He's got seven shots to kill him.  He's like, yeah, baby.  In two hours, by the way.  Two hours, he did seven shots.  That's pretty impressive.  Oh, my God.  So your question is, is Taylor going to do one more so she can get second place?  Third place.  You should have third place.  There's a tie.  You'll sleep better on the plane.  No, I feel like I'm going to throw up just after that one shot.  There's four people tied with one shot each.  And we never found out what's wrong with her marriage.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the biggest annoyance with the female?  I have the problem with the marriage.  What do you mean?  He's wonderful and amazing, and I'm just like a bitch. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, man.  Really?  Are you a bitch?  Yeah, total bitch.  Why are you a bitch?  What do you do?  She called my best friend.  Give us a good bitchy example of what you would do to him to be considered a bitch.  Oh, my God.  Wake up.  There's so many.  So many.  Okay, like this one time, he didn't make a dinner reservation for a Friday night, so  I started flipping my shit, because I was like, why wouldn't...  I just moved in with him, and my mom said to me, if you move in with the guy, he's going  to get complacent and lazy.  He's not going to post you.  So, I mean, obviously, that ended up happening.  Man, that is some rock you got there on that fincher. 
[02:40:00]  Well, on that fincher.  So, we went out to...  So, I moved in with him, and then that was the first night that he didn't make a dinner  reservation for a Friday night.  So, I was like, he already got complacent.  So, you're thinking mom's right.  Totally.  So, we went out, so I bitched at him, and then we went out for dinner, but I was like,  no decent place.  You can't go to a decent place with a day of reservation.  So, we went there, and I started yelling at the waitress, because the wine sucked.  I said it tastes like...  What was it?  I said it tastes like the blood of Christ.  It was like church wine.  It was horrible.  You should have actually made a reservation at Dorsey. 
[02:40:30]  It's wonderful.  Very hard to get into.  Amen.  In beautiful business cards.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, man.  So, we got in a fight, because...  She took me out to dinner.  What a bitch, right?  That is fucking...  I'd be so pissed.  Like, I'm fucking taking her out to dinner, and you're bitching at me?  Yeah.  Yep.  And I'd say, keep your fucking mother out of our shit.  Don't let her fucking influence what I'm doing.  She don't know me.  If she wants to come over here and suck my dick, then she can comment on what a fucking  asshole I am.  Wow. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  You gotta lay these bitches out straight.  Just suck a dick.  Hey, you know what?  I don't know about that.  Then she'll probably shut the fuck up next time.  And she didn't do anything.  She was the one that put the bug in your ear about him being complacent.  No, she just put a general bug in my ear.  Not a specific bug.  General bug.  General bug.  All right.  Are you guys gonna survive, or what?  We're gonna make it.  You're gonna make it?  We're long haul.  I love him.  We're gonna make it.  Is he attentive to you, let's say?  Attentive to all your needs?  He's a Jewish guy, so of course.  Wait, wait.  I don't mean financially.  I mean in the sack. 
[02:41:30]  Rich is a Jewish guy.  No.  I mean it in a good way.  Jewish men make the best husbands.  But is he attentive?  Does he go down on you and stuff?  Oh, like that?  Oh, we're not doing that.  Does he?  Look, look.  Nothing?  No, not we're not doing that.  No, no, no, no, no.  You and I.  I understand.  We're not doing that.  Look, look, look.  I understand.  And I'm not saying, that's why I said I didn't, I had to say because you weren't understanding  me for a second.  Let's just say, is he attentive in every way that you need him to be?  Yes.  Whatever I need, he provides.  All right.  That's all I'm gonna say.  Except reservations. 
[02:42:00]  No, he got it.  He didn't get the reservation.  I never did that ever again.  Oh, look at her.  She never, he never.  Are you Jewish?  What are you Irish?  No, but I act like I am.  What are you Irish?  No, I'm, I'm, what am I?  Are you Irish?  I'm German and French.  Oh.  That's a good combination.  Why do you lost the war twice?  I know.  I know.  She fucking takes over.  Why do you get drinking with you guys?  That's good.  At 9.30 in the morning.  Uh-huh.  I do have to go back, though.  I have to.  All right, Taylor.  All right.  Cosmo Radio.  Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  Is she doing the one more before she goes? 
[02:42:30]  It's up to her.  I've seen her, and I like that she actually spoke up and let everybody know her Jewish husband  licks her box.  She's shaking her head.  Wait, she might go for the second shot.  The really nice thing is if she does one more, E-Rock says he'll do one more.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, come on.  Come on.  Wait, E-Rock's just tapping out.  No, I'm not tapping out.  We're running low, but I just was told Heather B will be here in about 10 minutes.  Can I, can she take half of mine?  Can I do a half?  Oh, you got to do it.  I'll be a lightweight.  Oh, come on. 
[02:43:00]  Highway, how many have you had?  It's way too many.  We lost count.  We're not going to get the bronze?  No, we're not.  I'm purely exhibitionist.  Yeah, we're not allowed to win any awards because we host a show.  If I throw up, will you guys still like me?  Yeah.  Love you even more.  I can love you if you throw up.  I'd like a good chick that throws up.  Cheers.  No, give me your cut.  E-Rock.  No, we're running low.  I'm saving it.  But you have some.  No, I already did my shot.  Where's the coffee? 
[02:43:30]  I don't like the coffee.  You guys, I have to go.  I've got to go.  Well, let her have the coffee.  We have other people coming in about 10 minutes, so I want to save it.  Heather's going to have the coffee.  No, E-Rock, you can't fucking stop.  Yeah, you've got to do it with me.  That's so bad.  You've got to do some.  That's what matters.  That's what matters.  You've got to.  We'll figure it out, but you've got to.  If we've got to bring the Clooney tequila in, you've got to do that.  I'll do the Clooney.  I hate the coffee.  Well, then do that.  There you go.  Okay.  Yeah, there's plenty in there.  Wow, that's a big shot there, E-Rock.  Wow, E-Rock.  All right.  Cheers.  Salud.  Salud.  Taylor is now going into second place. 
[02:44:00]  Or third place.  Oh, my God.  Two shots.  Oh, that one hurt.  Wow.  That one left its.  That one hurt.  That left its mark.  No, I'm just kidding.  Wow.  Damn.  Okay, thanks, boys.  All right, Taylor.  Mazel tov.  Mazel tov, Taylor.  Mazel, mazel.  Thank you.  Mazel.  Don't be a stranger.  Taylor from Cosmo Radio.  There she goes.  What's she wearing there?  What do you got on?  She looks good.  She's got a little black thing, a little wrap around.  She looks very good.  She's got a nice ass on her.  She's wearing, like, hammer pants.  All right.  You're all right, then. 
[02:44:30]  You've got a pretty sexy body on you.  Oh, she is.  Yeah, you're going to like that.  She's got a nice breast.  Look at a nice ass on her.  She's an ample.  Which was going to be at McGuire's.  She wanted a donut, but she can't leave the front desk.  Wait, what happened?  Shit.  Iraq, what happened?  The secretary, the front desk lady.  But she wants a donut.  She wants a donut.  Well, you can't have a donut without the tequila on Tequila Donut Day.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, that's part of the rules.  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  Cool.  It's kind of sexy.  Huh?  There was something about her.  The voice.  Yeah, yeah.  The voice thing.  The attitude.  She's in third place, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Two shots for Tay-Tay.  Denny's in second with three shots.  And Iraq's up to eight.  Eight?  Eight, because he did two just now.  Did you really?  And let's put Handsome Johnny Tube steaks on the list there.  Yep.  Put them on the board.  One more than Sal.  By the way, Handsome Johnny Tube steaks has been talking for the last.  Handsome Johnny Tube steaks.  It's a fucking casino. 
[02:45:30]  He's got the eyes.  Casino.  I love it.  Rich Voss pointed out the eyes.  He's got the eyes.  Is that what it is?  His sparkling blue eyes?  The kid was a 10.  He's going to go places.  You think he's got a future in the business?  Don't let Denny see me slouching, by the way, as I broadcast.  No, he wouldn't like that.  He wouldn't like that at all.  You have to sit up straight when you broadcast.  You guys don't stand up.  Slouching and slurring.  You're dying.  Slouching and slurring is the name of this show.  Johnny's been talking for the last two days.  About the big trade?  About the fact that Opie wants him here really bad. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  What's he been saying?  He's just been excited that, one, that he's been talked about, and two, he'll take Sal's place  in a moment, in a moment, in a moment, in a moment, in a moment, in a moment.  You are really having a hard time holding together this fucking speaking.  This is what I want to aspire to, is Eric fucking sloppily talking on the radio.  Excuse me, excuse me, can I?  Oh, shit!  I've been providing content for three fucking hours.  What?  By just drinking and making yourself seem super pathetic. 
[02:46:30]  And guess what?  The hosts don't like you.  And by the way, Sal is sitting there being like,  I'm not going to provide content by just drinking tequila.  If you guys want me to put on a thong and bronzer up my body, I'll do it.  Oh, wow, Sal.  Oh, Sam, you fucking nailed him.  Because he rocks the man today.  I think Sal's being a party pooper.  He is.  Why are you being a party pooper, Sal?  What's going through your mind?  What do you think you'll be saved if you come in and take a shot?  Yeah, what's going through your mind?  Coffee shot.  I'm sorry.  I would do it gladly after the show, but not right now. 
[02:47:00]  After the show?  Is this a professional decision?  No, he's not professional.  No, it's just, I just think it's kind of pathetic here watching Eric get fucking drunk  at fucking 7 in the morning.  But it's tequila and donut Friday.  And by the way, listen to this list.  If this was a regular fucking Tuesday, then it would be a little weird.  Two for Tuesday.  Right, but this was a package E-Rock put together.  Listen to this list.  A bit.  He put a bit together for the show.  A bit.  The Sex Man, Denny, Tay-Tay, Road Dog, Stinky, Rich Davis, Big Dave LaGreca, Handsome Johnny 
[02:47:30]  Tube Stakes, those are the primetime players of Sirius XM.  Not one pathetic name.  No, exactly.  And those are the people taking shots.  That's the cool table.  You know what?  That's the cool table.  That's the back of the bus.  That's the back of the bus.  Back of the fucking bus.  We got eight guys that have done the tequila.  You know what?  This is, you watch Mad Men, this was every day for them.  Every day.  Every day.  And cigarettes, by the way.  Every day.  We're not even talking cigarettes.  Every fucking day.  And Sal's over.  I just think it's really pathetic that these guys are subjective.  I didn't say them, I said Eric, because Eric's getting fucking hammered. 
[02:48:00]  And he's the fucking man.  You know what?  I'll do something better.  I'll show you the pictures of the guy that I took this morning on the train.  It's like, oh, that's right.  I didn't take it.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Let me throw myself under the bus.  Oh.  All right.  Do it.  Get the jack to lift the bus up.  The nine years that I've been on this show.  Nine.  Nine years.  Nine years?  Nine years.  Nine years.  Holy fuck, really?  Nine years that I've been on this show.  Yeah.  Not only have I provided good content for this program. 
[02:48:30]  Can you name some of the bits?  Because I don't remember, really.  He's selling himself.  He almost died from the Sydney Challenge.  I know.  I love his arm gestures here.  Ladies and gentlemen, Frankie Blue Eyes.  Frankie Blue Eyes.  We have the Frankie Blue Eyes.  Frankie Blue Eyes.  And we've got to fuck that listener.  Oh, God.  Wait, name some of the bits that you almost died.  Not only have I almost died for this show.  For this show.  For this show.  Am I the only one seeing this?  No one cares about you.  Turn your mic off. 
[02:49:00]  Not only have I not almost died for this show.  Not almost died.  Not almost died.  Right.  Of course.  I've taken body scarring with hot wax shots.  Which we're going to redo for the elevator show.  Can we do it today?  It won't hurt as much.  In the same bit, I've bashed my head into the toilet mechanism at the K-Rock bathroom.  Toilet mechanism.  Fucking Jack Black and campaign.  Okay.  He is campaigning for himself right now.  I've taken grapefruit shots to the eye.  Oh, I forgot about grapefruit shots to the eye. 
[02:49:30]  That was good.  Can we do that in the elevator?  Yeah, but who cares about that?  That's weak.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Now he's producing my elevator show.  That son of a bitch.  What else do I do?  I've danced in my underpants.  That's where Steve C. has put dollars in my pants when we got the new stripper pole.  Yes.  Keep going.  I've danced in my underpants singing the Nannerpuss song.  I remember the Nannerpuss song.  In my underpants, he said.  Someone's mentioning liquid ass breath spray. 
[02:50:00]  I don't think that was me.  There was liquid ass sprayed on you, wasn't there?  We did that more.  All right.  Then I'm going to...  I'll bounce that person.  You know what?  I don't know, but I don't remember that one.  Did you say the cinnamon challenge?  Yeah, I said I almost died.  I know, but you didn't say why.  Almost arrested at the Tony Danza show.  Well, that's the next thing I was going to get through.  I got assaulted and almost arrested at the Tony Danza show.  Pepper!  Pepper Hicks!  Fucking Pepper Hicks.  Fucking some drunk asshole just texted me saying that there's free fucking liquor in here.  That's, yes.  By the way, that's Pepper Hicks? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm Pepper Hicks.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  I had no idea who you were.  Pepper fucking rules.  Where's she from?  We're going to trade for you too, Pepper.  Whatever, just fucking give me the fucking tequila.  Give him the coffee.  All right.  Pepper is getting some coffee tequila.  Cafe tequila.  Can I smell the coffee tequila?  Top off yours.  Come on.  Wait, hang on.  Pussy.  What?  Oh, fuck.  Pepper's in.  He's all in.  Oh, God.  E-Rock's...  E-Rock!  What?  He's banging into my chair like a fucking drunk. 
[02:51:00]  Shit, does that smell good?  It doesn't?  Yes, it really does.  Let me smell.  It really smells all right.  It's very coffee-like.  You're not a coffee guy.  It's very coffee-ish.  Yes.  Pepper just slammed it waiting for E-Rock.  You want another one, Pepper?  You want another one?  Let's do it.  Oh!  Here it is.  Pepper, you're going to tie for third place.  Pepper, you're tying for third place.  Keep going.  We've got to do it.  Hold on, hold on.  Peppy is a way around.  Wow.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock's.  He spilled. 
[02:51:30]  E-Rock's just a good example.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Officially, how many shots is that?  That's two.  At least.  That's two more.  Would you say this is just...  I haven't done two in this.  No, I think in that glass, there's two shots.  Oh, boy.  Would you say that's fair?  All right, that's fair.  Okay.  Okay.  Write them up.  Here they go.  Cheers.  The salute.  There goes Peppy Hamburger.  Oh, God.  And fucking E-Rock just did a double shot.  Slammed it down.  Oh, shit.  How do you feel, E-Rock?  You can tell pepper spray is going to go forever, man. 
[02:52:00]  Well, I have to do a show prep for the Ron and Faye show.  Uh-huh.  Ah, Ronnie won't mind.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, no problem, man.  Wait, if you do one more, though, you got third place by yourself.  You know that.  All right, then let's go for it.  Oh, shit.  You get the bronze.  I don't think anyone's going to get the bronze.  He just poured a lot of them.  You don't give a fuck.  Man, pepper is the real deal.  That's good.  That's a double shot.  It shakes it down with a little Coke, and you are good.  You want a donut?  You want a donut?  Yeah.  Pepper, I like you on the air, by the way, Ronnie.  Thank you, guys.  You do a very good job.  Absolutely.  Pepper, you fucking drunk fuck. 
[02:52:30]  Friday the bed is 11 a.m. to 3.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Take it easy.  Pepper just took second place.  Pepper.  Oh, second.  Yeah, that's a double shot he did just now.  Pepper Hicks just took.  Well, let's get Danny to see if he has something to say about that.  I love Pepper.  Let me go grab Danny.  Oh, so continue, Iraq.  Pepper's the best.  Tony Danza.  Right, Tony Danza.  I think this is a big-time face to Sal, who now has his arms crossed as he continues to  pout.  I did the Hawk thing on Fox, live, running around, flapping my arms like an asshole.  And that was his first fucking nickname. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah, Hawk.  We tried for the Hawk, but it didn't stick.  Mayo Challenge?  Yes.  Oh, Mayo Challenge?  Was that the one where your eyes turned red?  Yeah, that was bad.  You broke blood vessels in your eyes.  He blew out his eyes.  He was puking.  Three-fourths of the jar.  Yeah, yeah.  Eating.  Peanut Butter Hat?  Peanut Butter Hat?  Fluff Hat.  A lot of people remember this.  Fluff Hat.  Did the Fluff Another Hat.  Chubby Bunny.  Yeah.  Thank you.  I forgot about that one.  And what better way to close you that one?  I did Dance Friday on Channel 11.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Well, how you doing? 
[02:53:30]  I've done a fucking lot for this show.  Right.  For this show.  Man, let me tell you.  Oh, wow, is he fucking...  You're doing all right, Iraq.  So what do you...  What?  He just touched my shoe.  I have my...  I'm kind of a Friday casual kickback on my feet up on the console.  Make sure Danny's okay with that.  Iraq just grabbed the toe of my shoe and shook it.  Like, hi.  Uh, how you doing, man?  This is, uh...  How you doing?  This is the producer of the hottest show on Sundays.  How you doing?  The Sam Roberts show.  Oh!  4 p.m. Eastern on this day. 
[02:54:00]  Wow.  Jackson Bull.  Jackson Bull.  Yeah, that's me.  Jackson Bull in the house.  Holy fuck.  In person.  I've heard you.  And, uh...  Oh, Iraq.  You gotta go get the, um...  What do we got?  Shots here?  Let me go get the other one.  Get some Clooney vodka from, uh...  Holy shit.  ...Roland.  Uh...  I just came from a bachelor party, too.  What?  Just?  Well, two days ago.  Wait.  You just came from one two days ago?  He does.  He does.  Budget bachelor party.  It was the worst bus ride I've ever taken in my life.  I'm not really understanding. 
[02:54:30]  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  I just felt like...  Shit.  ...a zombie.  And you had to get on a bus for the trip back to New York?  Yeah.  Were you puking?  Dry here?  It's terrible.  From where?  From AC.  Which, if you've ever been there, it's...  No, no, we've never.  AC.  How is it?  If you're anywhere in between the casinos or resorts, it's a wasteland.  Yes, it really is.  It's Thunderdome.  It's terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  Why were you in between?  Because I had to get there.  I took a bus ride. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, the bus.  It goes through the streets like that?  Yeah.  You should just stay on the highway, though.  Right?  Until you get to the boardwalk.  It's crazy.  I wouldn't do that.  Unless I'm armed.  Right.  We're waiting for Iraq to come back with the George Clooney tequila.  Because Iraq apparently drank all the Patron.  Sex Man is up to ten fucking shots.  Ten shots.  He did almost half the bottle himself.  Wow.  Yeah.  Almost.  I have nothing to do with this when he dies of alcohol poison.  Nah.  He can't. 
[02:55:30]  He's a big dude.  That's probably like three shots to a regular guy.  What?  We have a bit of a problem.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  It'll be a great problem.  Trust me.  All right.  All right.  What's that?  What's that?  Nice.  This is the George Clooney tequila.  Tequila.  Tequila.  Tequila.  And that's the bottle Roland's been drinking out of it.  There's the Patron bottle.  Just hit the fucking garbage.  Right.  We have Roland's bottle.  Roland here at one shot.  But you remember that shot he took was a big shot. 
[02:56:00]  Right.  Didn't you?  I haven't seen Roland since.  No.  Wow.  He's not in the office.  I don't know where he went.  So you're going to take a shot.  You're going to take a shot out of his bottle.  Oh, my God.  He's pulling them.  He almost broke his nose.  He's fucking crazy.  And did we lose Denny for good?  Yeah.  Denny said he was okay giving up second place.  All right.  He said, I got to go to work.  All right.  All right.  You two want to do a little cafe?  No, I didn't.  No?  He didn't do it yet.  You want silver Patron?  Sure.  Or actually the George Clooney?  I would go with coffee.  I would go with coffee.  It's better.  Do the coffee, fucker. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, do the coffee one.  Yeah, do the coffee.  We got to get rid of the coffee.  All right.  Here we go.  Wait, wait, wait.  Cheers.  Salud.  Salud.  You drinking?  Oh, God.  Oh, that's smooth.  Yeah.  Oh, that's smooth.  Oh, my God.  I need to know.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I need to know.  How drunk are you?  I need to know.  What? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a kill is better than the Patron, by the way.  You like that one better than the Patron?  I think he's got me a bottle.  What does it taste like?  I think Roland has a bottle for me because I'm psyched.  He does, too.  But, E-Rock, how did that taste?  I'll enjoy that for a shot.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Roland wants another shot.  Roland.  Roland, give it a big shot.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Roland.  Roland.  Sit.  Roland, pour it out the George Clooney tequila bottle.  I want to pass pepper.  You do?  So, how many shots would that be?  I think you just poured two and a half in there.  Two shots. 
[02:57:30]  That's like almost a quarter cup.  Yeah.  That's four.  Two?  Three.  Four?  Let's call it three.  All right.  We'll call it three.  Give me a shot of donuts.  All right.  What do you guys, uh, holy shit.  Hey, Roland, by the way, E-Rock did just take a shot of the George Clooney tequila and said  it went down really smooth.  It's smooth.  All right.  Let's do it.  Do another shot.  Fuck it.  E-Rock, no more.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Holy fuck.  Hey, you got it.  And he washes it down with it.  What?  The garbage.  That was good. 
[02:58:00]  What?  What?  Oh, E-Rock's now fucking fist bumping.  Fist bumping.  Did you do yours?  Uh, give it to me.  E-Rock, do another one with him.  Get yours.  Not the gothy one.  E-Rock, do two with him.  Yeah.  Do you want that one?  Yeah.  All right.  Pour him out.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Pour one out, baby.  Yeah.  Maybe even one for your homies.  E-Rock, you're due.  Come on.  Yeah, one more.  It's your promotion.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Oh, he's pouring it on the carpet for the homies.  E-Rock, do a shot with the guy. 
[02:58:30]  Come on.  It's your promotion.  I did enough.  You did enough?  All right.  He's up to 11.  Maybe he needs a breather.  Smooth.  Yeah, show him.  Oh, it is.  Is it?  Yes.  The last one was really smooth, huh?  Going down.  Is it smooth?  That's water.  What?  What?  How dare you, sir?  Oh.  Oh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  What's the proof on it?  Wow, that kid is a fucking gangster. 
[02:59:00]  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  He thinks it's just water.  That's what you got to do to hang on Sundays around here.  What proof is that?  It actually doesn't say.  I bet it.  Wait, 40% alcohol.  40% alcohol?  E-Rock, he proof.  E-Rock, he says it's water out of the George Clooney bottle.  You said it went down smooth.  It went down smooth.  E-D proof.  Do one more.  It went down very well.  Do one more shot.  Come on.  Come on.  Little one.  One more Clooney.  This is my cup.  All right.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  All right.  That was more than I should have pulled out. 
[02:59:30]  Hopefully.  More than a shot.  It goes smooth.  Let's go.  Wolf it.  Come on.  There we go.  Oh, God.  He's getting prepared.  Yeah.  How is it?  How is it?  That's good.  Is it good?  It's good.  It's good.  It's good.  He is fucked up.  Oh, my God.  How do you say that?  What?  Casa?  Casa Migos. 
[03:00:00]  Tequila.  George Clooney.  Well done.  And how many Clooney shots have you done?  Three.  There's about three.  That was the first one I did of Clooney's.  The rest were all three.  No, the other one.  What's not?  No.  You did one.  You rock.  It's smooth.  I love it.  Smooth.  That's probably distilled a little different than the Patron, I would imagine.  Well done.  It just goes right down, huh? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  That fucking shit is like half gone.  How are you feeling, Roland?  You did like a huge cup full.  I know, but I weigh like four people.  Oh, okay.  I got a long way to go.  So that all equaled out.  Yeah, this is only his second shot.  Right.  So back to Sal.  You were giving him a talk to you.  Oh, my God.  Where is Sal?  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  Yeah, sorry.  I was taking a call.  What's up?  What's the matter, Iraq?  You all right, Bubba?  Iraq.  Woo!  How you doing?  Everything is blurring. 
[03:01:00]  So Opie here, here, and here.  Oh, you're so free of me.  Which one's the Oopster?  Yeah, the Oopster, Opie, and Greg Hughes.  Do you feel okay, though?  You're in this general area.  Oh, my God.  Do you have the spins?  A little bit?  No, I don't have the spins, but it's like all over.  It's blurred.  Holy shit, he's fucked up.  Oh, no, Iraq.  How many, uh, ants?  Your eyes are tearing, too.  How many anthony's you see? 
[03:01:30]  He's right here.  Why is your...  You're over here.  Your eyes are totally tearing.  Yeah, your eyes are tearing.  Like, you're crying, tearing.  Look, there's tears running down your face.  And he can't keep them straight.  Iraq, why are you crying?  Look who he looked for.  I have no idea.  Oh, um, they're called tequila eyes.  Are you okay?  No, they're called tequila eyes.  But I see his lip is quivering, too.  Iraq's crying.  What's happened?  I'm fine.  He's crying.  He's crying.  This is fucking bizarre.  It's not watery eyes. 
[03:02:00]  He's actively crying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Why are you crying?  I see your lip quivering.  Why are you crying?  I'm not.  Okay.  Um, maybe I need a donut.  Yeah, you need a donut, buddy.  Chocolate, chocolate.  He doesn't think he's crying?  I don't like chocolate.  That isn't just tears, like, like, like, when something goes down.  He's...  What's the matter?  That tastes awful.  Oh, this hangover is not going to be good. 
[03:02:30]  No.  Man, I don't have sugar on it.  And it's going to...  Why is he crying?  The hangover is going to kick in.  He's got tears pouring down his face.  And it's...  Can I tell you something?  Yeah, yeah.  What?  He's got to build the...  Worst of the week countdown.  Oh, that's good luck.  E-Rock's breaking donuts open and throwing them.  Oh, he wanted to do it.  He probably likes.  How's that one, buddy?  Full of jelly.  He's crying.  Why? 
[03:03:00]  I don't understand this.  Why are you crying?  E-Rock, you're emotional right now for some reason.  Why?  Did the tequila just tap into, like, a region of your head?  I don't even know that I'm crying.  I am fucking baffled here.  Holy shit.  I have seen some shit with this radio show.  What the fuck?  Wow.  You don't know you're crying?  You've got tears pouring down your eyes?  Nope. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, wow, man.  Rich Voss, where are you going to be?  You haven't talked to him.  I'll be...  You can't follow this.  No.  No.  I don't even know I'm crying.  What's on your mind, dude?  It's like the beginning of therapy.  Not a thing.  Not a thing.  I'm good.  Who's your least favorite person on the staff? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, there's a lot.  There's a lot, right?  Yeah.  Who do you think treats you the worst?  That would be you.  You think so?  Yeah.  Why is that?  Because you're an asshole.  Oh, shit.  Why do you think that?  Because it deflects all attention off of you, but lays positive attention on you.  I see.  If that makes any sense.  I see.  If doesn't.  I don't think it does.  I don't think so either.  So I'm the biggest asshole.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's checking in real quick. 
[03:04:30]  He said, did that fuck put my show on the system before he got shit fixed?  Yes, Dr. Steve, that was done winning.  You should puke, man.  Maybe you should puke.  I don't feel sick, though.  Yeah, but you should get an asshole.  I know, but you're crying.  You don't even know you're crying.  I can see this ending horribly.  You want to belly up to the garbage and stick your fingers down your throat?  Go home.  You're done.  Holy shit. 
[03:05:00]  Scott and Todd end at 948.  And we're going to end at 952.  And it's 952 something.  I'm staying in this seat for a little longer.  Fuck that.  Go home.  No one needs you.  Go home.  Go home.  No one needs you.  No one needs you.  Did you see how quickly this transformed?  Like, he was pretty buzzed and shit.  Then he went to a whole new fucking place.  And it was the Clooney shots.  It was the Clooney shots that put him over the top because they're smooth.  Dude, this is dangerous.  Puke.  The donut really didn't help. 
[03:05:30]  So, fucking.  No.  Could you make yourself puke?  Could you make yourself puke?  I don't feel nauseous.  I don't feel sick.  Yeah, but we're like.  But to get it out of your system.  Yeah, because, you know.  We're a little worried.  That's like a 7 a.m., 8 a.m. bit.  No, I'm not doing it for a bit.  I'm kind of thinking of alcohol poisoning.  I'm not thinking bit.  Yeah, I don't feel nauseous.  I can't really force myself to.  You sure?  You want to at least try?  No, I don't.  I don't think it would pay off well. 
[03:06:00]  Eric, do you know, after all this.  Yeah.  After the fact that he wouldn't do anything.  Who?  Sal is in there cheering with his hands up.  Why are you cheering, Sal?  No one gives a shit.  Sal, I love that everything's just coming out of Eric.  This is fantastic.  No one gives a shit about him.  Nobody.  He had a legitimate story.  Yeah.  To start the show.  Which is on the news right now.  Oh, it is.  About the train.  And he was on 42nd Street.  Look, I've taken really shitty photos that you've destroyed me over. 
[03:06:30]  Like when that various planes crash in the Hudson.  I took a photo where you're like, oh, it's just styrofoam.  That's not really anything.  When people have died in Hoboken on the.  Oh, the car crash.  Yeah, the car crash.  I've seen four of them.  You were an eyewitness, right.  One died on 57th Street.  Oh, the bus guy.  Yeah.  See, I remember all this shit.  Okay, I've taken photos of that and you've destroyed me for the fact that these photos really 
[03:07:00]  aren't very specific.  Whoa, it's doing one.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony, what are you doing?  No.  You've got to stop, dude.  He just surpassed me.  What the fuck?  He's still drinking.  He's drinking directly out of the bottle.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen anything like this.  He's finished the bottle.  Anthony just did a half a bottle of tequila.  Incredible. 
[03:07:30]  Amazing.  And I know, I know, that he doesn't like me, but, this is like Jimmy, but what?  That was awesome.  Iraq, my friend, and I do like you a lot.  You're crazy.  You're crazy.  You're crying again.  You know that, right?  Now I know. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, shit.  What he just did?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome.  It was fucking beautiful.  Fucking beautiful.  And you can isolate that.  And take a photo.  I will.  Wow.  Not Sam on Twitter.  You'll see that later.  Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  Iraq's fucking tearing up this Friday.  I love it.  He is tearing up the Friday.  Tequila and Donut Day was a success.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Rich Voss.  Yes, exactly.  We have not given Rich Voss' fair share.  Oh.  Rich, where are you going to be?  I'll be at McGuire's this weekend, and next weekend at the MGM Grand.  Grand.  Don't worry about me.  Don't worry about me.  No, no, no.  I'm just talking about you.  Because I always got...  I always liked Iraq.  I always got a lot.  But I want to know why Sam is an ass to him, and how does Sam have the power to be an ass  to you when you bring him?  Because these two douchebags let him.  Oh, man.  And I'm making the metal sign to point at both of them. 
[03:09:00]  No, I think they figured it out there in radio light.  Oh, shit.  And I will say, as much as you shit on the first segment with the Scott and Tom Rundown,  where they talk for an hour and seven minutes and 35 seconds, they end their show at roughly  9.48, 9.49.  You are at 9.57.  Yes.  We're doing good.  I don't know how much you make.  How much do you think? 
[03:09:30]  It's a fuckload.  I don't know.  How much do you think?  No, no, and it doesn't matter.  Shut up.  It doesn't matter.  E-Rog, shut up.  I love you guys.  This is great.  Shut up.  I love you guys.  I love this.  Oh, E-Rog.  The other two douchebags who we mentioned in the first hour, one makes over $4 million.  Damn.  One makes $2 million just for doing the radio.  You know the resentment they must have for not making the same amount?  Sure.  Resentment.  What resentment you two must have for the fact that they talk an hour and seven minutes. 
[03:10:00]  Thank you.  And this company doesn't give two fucks about what you do.  I hear you.  He's right.  I hear you, E-Rog.  Now we're all set.  Now we're all going to start crying.  This will be replayed on the after show.  This will be talked about Monday.  Right.  And I'm sure at some point it will be part of the worst of the week countdown.  I am so not tuning away from this channel until tonight.  Wait a minute.  I am so listening to Sam Roberts. 
[03:10:30]  I'm listening to Ron and Fez.  I'll post for you.  I'll post for you.  I'll post for you.  E-Rog.  E-Rog.  Try to puke some of the alcohol out.  All right, all right.  What about alcohol poisoning?  You can't force that because I don't feel lost.  Yeah, but you've got at least ten shots of tequila.  This might be a Sam exclusive.  You have to listen.  Tell me this, E-Rog.  You're not exactly in the shape to build the countdown.  No, I'll build it.  Well, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, hang on.  Who knows how to build the countdown?  Who knows how to load it?  Who knows how to do your work and decided to spend the show sober? 
[03:11:00]  The guy who doesn't care about the show.  Who's that?  That dude.  That dude.  Sal.  He's pointing to Sal.  Sal, you better fucking defend yourself.  I'm going to throw a mini pizza party in Eric's honor today.  Oh, a mini pizza party.  Up top.  Up top.  All right.  Sal, are you going to defend yourself?  I'll gladly help Eric through this one.  No, you won't gladly help me.  You will do the countdown.  Because at 11 o'clock, as soon as Sam is done, unless Rod and Fez request me, I'm going home. 
[03:11:30]  E-Rog!  E-Rog!  Done!  Fucking A.  How are you going to get home?  You can't drive.  Yeah, you can't drive.  Yeah, but there's car service.  Expensive.  Expense that shit.  No, I can't expense that shit.  No?  No.  The VA will not let me for four hours of me getting hammered in here.  Expense a drunk drive home.  Hey, look.  I fucked up.  You need to get me home.  They're not going to do that.  Yeah, but you know what, E-Rog? 
[03:12:00]  You didn't fuck up.  You didn't fuck up.  You shined.  You did shine.  You did shine today.  How's the wife going to feel about you being hammered this early?  Full supporter.  Full supporter?  Yeah.  That's nice.  She did Instagram a photo of the pad data that says E-Rog is drunk.  Oh, okay.  She did.  Yeah, she did.  Yeah, that'll go to a lawyer at some point.  Does Denny want to say goodbye?  No.  We got to get Denny in here.  No one cares.  No, Denny was pretty good.  How do you think about Dennis, E-Rog?  I love him.  Denny brought the professional aspect of radio. 
[03:12:30]  He really did.  To the show.  Even though he was drinking.  E-Rog, on the other hand, brings a more jovial festive.  I gave you a Friday show.  Yes, you did.  His gift to us.  My favorite part.  E-Rog just belched into the light.  My favorite part.  He was fucking crying his eyes out and had no idea he was crying.  No idea why.  I've never seen that before.  I've never seen that in anybody.  Anybody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't have the...  He's crying again.  Hold on.  He's being a little emotional.  I swear you're crying.  Your face gets very emotional. 
[03:13:00]  I swear you're crying.  Emotional, yes.  Crying, I don't think so.  But.  Okay.  We don't have the bleachers.  We can't have a Friday on it.  We don't have the walkover anymore.  Right, right.  Right.  So, since it was brought up this week that...  And I really am happy that Anthony actually supported the cause towards the end of the show.  I had to.  You're trying to have a bottle of tequila.  I try to find things that we've done during the week.  And we can maybe reapply it to the show. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Danny?  Hey, is this mic hot?  I don't want to touch it until it's on.  Is this mic hot?  I don't want to touch it until it's on.  It's on.  If it's on.  That is so...  Who cares?  Every little aspect of radio professionalism, he knows.  Who cares if it's hot?  Well, it's just, you know, like...  You don't move a hot mic.  No, you don't.  Make sounds.  You don't move a hot mic.  No, no.  You don't want to make those sounds because then the listener's saying,  Hey, gee, what's that?  It just distracts from the listening experience. 
[03:14:00]  It doesn't.  We've got to learn these things.  How's this guy feeling over here?  We're constantly...  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  He's crying, but he doesn't know he's crying.  We've got to get a listener to take him home.  You can get yourself an O.B. and Anthony prize pack.  You should probably tell Denny how you're feeling.  Denny did great.  The first three hours, he did great.  He's the Foster Brooks of Rain.  He's the Foster Brooks of Rain.  He's the Foster Brooks of Rain.  But he was great.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He was.  He just told me he's not needed now.  Who's the star now, Iraq?  Iraq loves telling people they're not needed any longer. 
[03:14:30]  No kidding.  You're past 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  Oh, sure.  He's going to hit the network news or something at the end of the hour.  Shut up.  Turn it to my goal.  Turn it off.  Who's the star right now, Eric?  The network news.  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  Don't laugh at me.  Turn it off.  And try to back time.  If you have two minutes, it's going to be saved by Maurice Williams.  It's a minute and 36.  All right.  It's the Denny Show.  This is one of the best Fridays ever.  Holy shit. 
[03:15:00]  So fucking weird.  You guys have like a regular sign-off like I was on, now I'm gone or anything like that?  I was on, now I'm gone.  All right.  Let's do something.  Next time we get together, I'll bring the coffee.  No need for the sugar because you, you're sweet enough.  All right.  Let's pretend it's your last show.  It's a benchmark.  Because you've been fired many times.  You don't get to do a last show.  E-Rock is a belligerent drama show.  Buddy goes, you don't get to do a last show, which is another radio thing.  It's true.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know that's true, E-Rock.  To quote the Great Ridge Voss, Pingo. 
[03:15:30]  You don't get to do a last show when you were fired from Terrestrial.  Right.  Do your final sign-off when, like, say, maybe CBS Infinity.  Hey, how about Fire or Fall?  Goodbye, I love you.  You're trying to create something here, and you're walking all over it.  Well, because I'm used to talking with the music under me.  Yeah.  No one cares.  Hey, we've got to get out of here.  No one cares.  I'm trying to Fire or Fall. 
[03:16:00]  No one cares.  He's got a song for everything.  Wait, let's do this.  Give me a topic.  E-Rock, throw out a topic and see if Denny has a song real fast.  No.  A topic, please.  Please, please, please, please, please.  You don't get a final sign-off.  Usually, you don't get a final sign-off when you work on Terrestrial radio.  True.  Especially when you work on a music station, because no one gets a fuck.  Right.  Well, no.  So.  Well, I wouldn't say that.  Pretend.  Yeah.  That this is your final show on whatever station you used to work at. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Give your final sign-off.  Like, the company's saying, look, you've put in a lot of hard time here.  We really respect the job that you did.  But because of budget cuts or format flip or something else, you're not going to be working here anymore.  Right.  So give your final sign-off.  Sal will pick a song.  No, he'll pick a song.  Denny needs his song.  It's his final show.  All right.  You should at least give him that.  Well, you got a song for me?  Sal will get the song.  No, what song do you want? 
[03:17:00]  Denny pick a song.  That's your last song on radio.  Let me see.  How about Goodbye, I Love You?  I think that's a good one.  By Firefall.  Sort of sentimental.  No one knows that song.  I know that song.  1979 hit music.  Yeah, but that's for nerds.  How about Deep Purple, Smoke on the Water?  There you go.  Really?  Oh, wow.  Really?  That's not cliche.  No, you pick your song, Denny.  Don't be influenced.  Well, I'm trying to get a good song here.  Go back here for a song.  How about The Tramps, Disco Inferno, as we burn this thing up?  Oh, man. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  You got it?  Which one do you want?  I want the single version of Disco Inferno.  Don't give me the seven-minute version.  Oh.  No.  Because that's what they play on the Studio 54 channel.  Before he does that?  You guys got to do some more cross-promoting.  Before you do that, to Anthony and Toby.  To Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm sorry I fucked this whole show up.  What?  Eric.  Oh, Christ.  What do you got for me, Sal?  Hold on.  Hold on, Dennis. 
[03:18:00]  Jesus.  You don't know good radio when it's right in front of your face.  You're stepping on a bit.  E-Rock, what are you talking about?  What do you mean you fucked it up?  What do you mean you fucked it up?  This is not what it was supposed to be.  What was it supposed to be?  What was it supposed to be?  It turned out.  Look at Rich.  Rich, do you miss partying?  Not at all, right?  What are you talking about, E-Rock?  Eric.  It was perfect.  The show was good.  Why are you crying and saying you messed it up? 
[03:18:30]  What I fucking love about E-Rock, this is where he got honest and fucking got evil with  this fucking jamoke right here.  E-Rock.  Okay, and I like that.  What was the show supposed to be?  What was the show supposed to be?  Not this.  What were you thinking it was going to be?  Ah, you know what?  Fuck it.  You're welcome for four hours.  Wait, what?  But why do you think the show sucked?  Or that you ruined the show?  A drinking show?  Yeah, but look, the donuts are gone, the tequila's gone. 
[03:19:00]  What kind of show did you want today?  You know what?  You're right.  You had nothing planned.  What happened?  What happened?  You're confusing everybody.  Yeah, because you came up with a tequila and donut show, but now you're saying that  you're sorry you ruined the show.  What makes you think you ruined the show?  I don't think people really wanted to hear this.  But now that I'm thinking about it and I've worked in radio for 19 years, yeah, they wanted 
[03:19:30]  to hear this.  So I retract my apology and go fuck myself.  This was awesome.  You sure?  You sure was awesome.  And?  Yeah, we went late.  I see that.  Yes.  It's past 10.  He's running the gamut of emotions.  10-08.  Yeah.  Bonus time.  Bonus time. 
[03:20:00]  Do we get bonus money, though?  Danny?  Well, you're stepping into somebody else's day party.  Yeah, Sam's show, which...  No, it's stepping into somebody else's day party.  Well, midday, though.  Are midday's that important in radio, Danny?  Well, sure.  It's the at work, you know, the at work listening.  Yeah.  Because people leave the radio on, you get all those quarter hours.  Oh, my God.  All those quarter hours.  How we doing, Iraq?  How you feeling?  I'm feeling great, Danny.  All right.  We've got to make way, because don't forget, 12 o'clock this afternoon, the Lunchtime All 
[03:20:30]  Request Show.  Can I do Denny?  And we'll be giving tickets away to see Rich Voss live.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Iraq wants to do Denny.  9-08, 8-8...  They got the timer.  9-08, 8 minutes after 8 o'clock.  Just like a chandelier.  I'm hooked on the ceiling.  Here's hooked on a feeling.  I like that.  Whoa.  Although you should slip in a little weather, you know.  Mom is dressing the kids up, too.  You're just slip in a little weather.  Mom's dressing the kids.  65 and sunny, going up for a high of 70 today. 
[03:21:00]  Make sure you bring the umbrella tomorrow night.  I might have some rain as you head out to see Rich Voss live and in person.  McGuire's this weekend.  Kind of do a little tonight.  It's tomorrow night.  It's 10-08.  Eric just said 9-08, 8 minutes after 8.  I know.  We all hurt.  9-08.  8 minutes after 8.  We were letting that one slide.  We all hurt.  Fucking, it's great.  How do these two not have their own show?  E-Rock and Denny.  Oh, yeah.  E-Rock and Denny show.  It would be great.  It would be great.  See, that doesn't matter.  Where are you going to be this weekend?  I'll be at McGuire's in Bohemia, but that doesn't matter either. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, because no one's going.  No one's going.  Oh.  That's okay.  E-Rock's allowed to do that.  It's going to be great.  I love Rich.  You don't want to.  Yeah, I do.  I love you.  I hate you.  I know.  It's a classic, classic intoxication.  We might have to do more drinking shows.  Go and stand up.  I should stand up.  What are you, fucking Jack Lane?  Fuck off.  No, he wants you to project your voice.  Denny's giving you some fucking tips. 
[03:22:00]  What's that?  Yeah, he's telling Denny.  Stand up.  Why don't you just stand up?  You bring it up.  Oh, yeah.  Your diaphragm, everything's straight.  You get a good fucking resonance to your voice.  Make sure you take a big breath right before you hit the mic and give him a nice big smile.  Eric, you know Sal's in there videoing you?  You're failing to see no one give a shit.  Why does no one give a shit?  Because Ope hates Sal.  He does, right?  He hates Sal.  It's just what it is.  And come Monday, we welcome Johnny Toobstack. 
[03:22:30]  Johnny Toobstack.  Wow.  Trades going down over the weekend?  Yeah.  Handsome Johnny Toobstack.  In the middle of the night, so the fans don't get pissed off?  Yeah.  So, Denny, you ready for your final song?  E-Rock set up the bit.  I think it's a good one.  Yeah.  Are we doing Firefall?  Oh, shit.  Whatever we do.  I got Disco Inferno.  All right.  Disco Inferno.  You know the ramp time in this song, Denny?  Just give it to me.  Who's that?  Tavares?  No, that would be The Tramps.  Oh, The Tramps.  Right.  Tavares did the other one from Saturday Night Fever. 
[03:23:00]  More Than a Woman.  More Than a Woman.  Which is written by the Bee Gees.  More Than a Woman.  Sounds like a Bee Gees song, right?  Yeah, it is Bee Gees song.  Of course, yeah.  No, I mean, it sounds like they were singing it.  Well, I've had myself a blast.  Reliving the past here on a Friday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Tequila and Donuts.  Don't forget Rich Boss.  He's going to be out there at Bohemia.  Make sure you go out and see him.  We're going to be out there with the Vans.  Sam's got the Wheel of Prizes.  You've got some Opie and Anthony Koozies to win.  That's right.  Also got some Chapsticks, too. 
[03:23:30]  Bring him into the Boss on Monday.  He'll get a kick out of that.  But my name is Dennis.  So much, don't forget, this coming weekend, here on the 60s on 6, everybody's favorite  cousin, Cousin Bruce, you'll be here at 8 o'clock.  Make sure you join him.  Yeah!  E-Rock, he fell.  That's fucking beautiful.  That is beautiful.  I'm helping out E-Rock, though.  How did I fail?  He failed.  He failed?  That was supposed to be his final sign-off.  He was just signing off for the week.  The thing is, you don't say anything, though. 
[03:24:00]  You never say goodbye.  You never.  He knows that.  He can't do that.  No, the radio station goes on, and you don't want to do anything bad.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Hope's right.  Well, but these...  Shut up!  This was your final send-off, and you promoted a fucking song.  He's a gentleman to the end.  He's a gentleman.  I would be fucking breaking the equipment and a professional.  No, you're not.  They fired him.  All right.  All right.  Say you go to another market.  You say, you know what?  That guy, you know what he did on his last break? 
[03:24:30]  Shut up.  I'm just a music shock.  I'm not Opie and Anthony.  Those guys are zany DJs.  They could do stuff like that.  Dennis.  I'm not going to do that.  I know.  And you're looking for your next gig.  I totally understand that.  But...  Oh, you have to go for his next gig.  You need to say your final goodbye to the audience that made you on the station that  you're currently on.  You don't say goodbye because the station is 24-7.  It goes on forever.  You don't say goodbye because you know what happens next week at 3 p.m., 6 a.m., whenever 
[03:25:00]  the fuck you're on?  Life goes on.  It's a loving dude, and guess what?  The audience doesn't give a shit.  And life goes...  Exactly.  Life goes on.  Doesn't give a shit.  Life goes on.  Your act goes between anger.  Doesn't give a shit.  Crying.  You say your goodbye.  And love.  And then you go off to Toledo.  Hey, look, my friend.  I've been in this business for 30 years, you know?  What's going on in Toledo, Eric?  Jim Norton will be.  All right.  I don't know the place, but he's in Toledo.  That's it.  I mean, come on.  You rock.  I mean, I just can't take it anymore.  I'm not insulting you.  I've got to listen to professionals like Radio War.  You're insulting me. 
[03:25:30]  No, you're a veteran.  I'm not insulting you.  I have the utmost respect for you.  But this is your last show.  You should say goodbye to the audience that supported you.  I said I've had a blast.  That built you.  Nah, it built me.  Come on, you just move on.  That's it.  And then you welcome them back when you go to the next station.  See you on down the dial, wherever that means.  See you on down the dial.  How do you not love them?  You've got them all.  But you didn't say that.  Answer for every situation.  That's the perfect thing you say. 
[03:26:00]  I'll see you at 1560 AM.  Any further to the right, I'll be in the glove compartment.  All right.  You know what?  This guy's broke.  I've done them all.  I've played polka music at 1390 WRIV.  You did?  I've done that.  You've done the polka.  Done it.  Done it all.  Done it.  Love it.  Yeah.  Good.  You supported him?  Yeah.  That's all that matters.  Shut up.  Rich Vox, I apologize for taking up all your time.  I have nothing today.  You're the star today, Joe.  Shut up.  This is nonsense.  He loves telling people to shut up.  I want to give you the opportunity. 
[03:26:30]  Where are you going to be this weekend?  I'll be at 1590 down the dial.  I'll be in the glove box.  We're in the glove box.  Denny really fucking did a great job today.  He stood out.  He's a professional broadcaster.  It's amazing.  This is a nice idea.  Great idea.  Wait, wait, wait.  Denny, you okay talking into a hot mic without your headphones on?  Yeah.  He goes, yeah.  Well, let me grab the headphones.  He can.  I'd like to keep the one ear on here in case, you know, we got, wait, traffic's on line 
[03:27:00]  one.  Okay, the traffic reporter.  Please keep the one ear off.  All right.  All right.  So you can hear.  We should give him one more song to go out on.  I think you're right.  Really?  What do you want to go out on?  Yeah.  How about a no intro song?  What's that mean?  What's the fucking point?  What's a no intro song?  What's the point?  Well, because shout's always a great weekend party song.  And that starts right off the bat.  Oh, you want to give me something else?  What do you want?  You pick something in there.  Not so.  You pick it.  No, no, no, no.  Sounds useless, you remember.  Sounds useless?  Yeah.  Don't listen to him. 
[03:27:30]  What do you want to do?  I know.  Working for the weekend.  That's right.  Yeah, lover boy.  Yeah, lover boy.  Go ahead.  Give it to me.  Here we go.  This is your weekend party song right here.  It's like Jerry's Gin Joint.  Oh, what is this?  The live version?  The live version.  Oh, again.  Holy shit.  Handsome Johnny Tube Steaks wouldn't do that.  All right.  It's time.  It's a five o'clock whistle.  We're getting out of the office.  You've been there all week working up a sweat, but now it's time to work out a boogie on 
[03:28:00]  the dance floor.  Lover boy, come on in here and show us how to rock and roll, because you and I, baby,  we're working for the weekend.  Let's do it.  Yeah!  Woo-hoo!  Wow.  Love it.  Opie's Chrysler video.  The Chrysler building video is up on Opie Radio on YouTube.  It's on the Facebook, opieandanthony.com.  Both videos are up there.  Check that out.  Doing very well, by the way.  Anthony's going to go home.  Rich Voss, again, where are you going to be?  You've got to go home. 
[03:28:30]  You've got to go home.  I will have my ear glued to the radio on the way home, too, by the way.  Hold on, hold on.  Rich Voss, where are you going to be?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Where are we?  McGuire's in Bohemia.  Then the MJMgram.  My wife hates me on iTunes broadcast.  Next weekend, it'll be on Sirius.  Next weekend.  This week is Bob Kelly's You Know What, Dude, but next week will be Rich Voss.  Yes, where Florentine was our marriage counselor.  Very nice.  And stay tuned.  After Opie and Anthony Live with Sam Roberts, we'll be coming up next. 
[03:29:00]  And this was a fine show.  What a great show.  He carried it.  Amazing.  Very good.  Final grade, A+.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A+.  Way to go, buddy.  He turned the D around.  A+.  Turned the D around.  We throw the D out.  We throw the D out.  Really?  A+.  A+.  Yes.  Honor roll.  And you didn't even play the Scott Shannon audio.  Oh!  I'll just give you the gist.  That whole staff hates him.  Oh, wow.  That whole show fucking hates him.  And you got proof. 
[03:29:30]  All three tracks are them just shitting on him saying, like, oh, Mr. Old Time Radio Guy  doesn't know that there's an internet that you can fact check.  And they say, he's full of shit.  Whoa.  So we're going to have to play it next week.  Yes.  Or maybe not.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Shit will happen over the weekend.  And you know what?  That'll be small potatoes.  C-Rock.  Do you want me a favor and close with this?  Sure.  Masked Sexual Flavors is the new way to foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.  Of course, these oral gel strips will be the spark to light your bedroom flame. 
[03:30:00]  Visit sexualflavors.com to purchase or find a retailer near you.  I love it.  Goddamn.  He reads drunk like I do regularly.  Exactly.  Rich Voss, before we go, one more time, where are you going to be?  Wow, you've never had more plugs.  You don't deserve them.  I didn't do it.  I love it.  You're not your best friend today.  Well, we always got along. 
[03:30:30]  Yes.  We go way back.  I play golf with his dad.  Rich, yes, that he does.  And he says, you're one of my favorite people to golf with.  Know why?  Because he calls my dad because my dad can get him on the PGA courses.  Oh, so he's using your dad?  No.  They're good friends now.  All right.  They are.  Rich, I'm going to shake your hand.  Thank you.  There's nothing else left for you to say.  Holy shit.  Sam's coming up with the after show.  Yeah.  Show's over. 
[03:31:00]  Go in peace.  That's it.  All right.  We're going.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Holy shit.  He rocks in the bathroom.  So real quick, before he comes back.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live, obviously.  Um, he did, I'm going to tell him Opie, is that right?  Yeah, the George Clooney tequila was water. 
[03:31:30]  He did, the final count was.  Well, he still did like.  He did 10 shots.  No, he did 10 official shots.  And then the one where he said on our show, when you listen to the replay today, when he  said, wow, that went down really smooth.  That was, that was a shot of water.  That's when I was in amazement going, he has no idea that he just did a shot of water.  That's how fucked up he is.  And then he did another double shot.  Of water.  Of water.  Saying, wow, this stuff's really smooth.  And then Ant grabbed the George Clooney tequila bottle.  Hate to give it away on Ant, but no one could drink that much tequila.  Ant slammed a half a bottle of tequila and Iraq was amazed by that. 
[03:32:00]  But it was water.  The whole bottle was.  Roland hit a shot.  I can't believe he drank that much water at once.  Yeah.  Roland refilled.  Roland poured out his bottle of tequila before the show with water.  Because Roland thought that he was going to get Iraq to drink a little more.  Not realizing that Iraq was all.  All in.  All in.  Everyone else did their shots, by the way.  Everybody else was legit.  The only thing that was fake was Roland didn't do his shot.  Iraq officially didn't do those last two to three shots.  Yeah.  And Ant obviously didn't chug a half a bottle of tequila.  It just tastes so much tequila in his mouth.  Any liquid in it tastes like tequila. 
[03:32:30]  The scoreboard.  But the scoreboard was official.  It's Iraq by far in first place with ten official shots.  Pepper Hicks with four.  Dennis with three.  Tay-Tay with two.  I have tons of pictures.  Did he do four, did he?  Yeah.  Because he did two.  And then a third was a double shot.  Now, people that drink ten shots is throughout the night, that would fuck you up, right?  Ten shots is a lot of shots.  Regardless.  That would kill you.  No.  I don't know.  I mean, you know, but yeah, you'd be drunk.  Yeah, Jesse May did it once when we all went out.  But ten shots is... 
[03:33:00]  Throughout the whole night.  Like, yeah, for a drinker.  Somebody who drinks multiple times a week.  If you go out and do ten shots, you're going to feel it.  Before you're really fucked.  I mean, when I was doing coke, we would drink, just drink and lose count.  Right.  But you have coke to neutralize it.  Yeah.  But even so, I mean, even on coke, ten shots is a lot of shots.  Yeah, I would imagine.  You know, I would imagine.  Somebody's got to check on Iraq.  He's been gone pissing for like seven minutes.  Hopefully he's vomiting.  No, I would want him to vomit in here if he's going to vomit.  James in North Carolina. 
[03:33:30]  You know today, by the way, was an action-packed show.  Hang on, James.  You know today was an action-packed show.  Opie Sudoku puzzle is not even halfway done.  He couldn't get it done today.  That's how action-packed today was.  I mean, you had Dennis becoming a star and E-Rock getting obliterated.  None of us thought he was going to go in that hard.  Yeah, that's our brother, the donuts.  What's up, James?  Y'all don't got to bump your head.  Hmm?  Today's show was fucking crazy. 
[03:34:00]  Amazing.  I got a question.  The king is back.  E-Rock returns.  Go ahead, James.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead.  Let me speak to E-Rock now.  Okay, E-Rock, James would like to speak to you.  How are you doing, buddy?  You feeling okay?  You look a little...  You put water on your face just now?  Yeah, I just...  Much to the chagrin of most of the people in the bathroom, I soaked my head.  You put your whole head in the sink?  Yeah.  Did anybody notice you?  I filled it up with paper towels, filled it up, and just submerged my face. 
[03:34:30]  Ooh, the whole Puerto Rican shower.  Who was in there with you?  Who the fuck knows?  It's not up to you to know.  Who cares?  You got your second wind now.  I'm a little better, yeah.  So, James, what were you going to say to E-Rock?  Okay, what's up, Big E?  Great job on the show today.  James in North Carolina, how you doing?  I'm doing fine.  I got two questions for you, buddy.  Sure.  I'd like to know one of two things.  A, is your wife planning on leaving you, or B, is she pregnant? 
[03:35:00]  Because there has to be a reason that you did this shit today, just other than you wanted to.  Okay, answer James' question.  Is your wife leaving you, or is she pregnant?  Are you stressed?  No, to both.  No, I'm not stressed.  If she was pregnant, I'd be ecstatic.  You'd be happy.  I'd be very happy.  You guys, you love kids.  You can afford it.  You both have great salaries, great jobs.  Yeah.  In a house, you have room.  Yeah.  You know, there'd be no reason to be as stressed.  No.  I think he did it because he's a team player, and he saw a good radio.  Yeah, why did you go in so hard today, E-Rock? 
[03:35:30]  Well, because...  Because this whole thing, Tequila Day was your brainchild from the beginning.  Very good.  Tequila was my day.  That doesn't make any sense, but I'll start over again.  We're going to keep moving forward.  Tequila Day was my idea.  Yeah.  And that was, I think we talked about it Tuesday?  Yeah.  Somewhere around there?  And I had been talking about it in the back office there, and Roland decided to throw  in Donut Day to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To that.  Right.  So it was going to become Tequila and Donut Day. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  I was on the assumption, and even though Roland did one shot?  Yeah.  Two shots?  Two shots.  One shot.  So Roland was going to do more shots with me, and I figured, you know, by 8.30, 9 o'clock,  other people on the show would do stuff.  They'd get into the spirit of Tequila Friday.  And I have to applaud, I have to applaud, because applaud doesn't make any sense.  Applaud is not a word.  No.  Applaud Anthony Cumia for joining in in the 9.30 hour, 9.30 portion of the show.  Drinking almost a whole bottle. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, that was unexpected.  Yeah, yeah.  But he stepped out to the place.  Yeah.  He did.  Well, Heather's here.  The Shade 45 crew is here.  Welcome, ladies.  How are you doing?  I am, I was doing good, now I'm doing great.  I'm a tequila girl.  You do?  You like the cafe tequila we have?  I had it once, and I'm going to have it twice today now.  This is what I'm talking about.  I love tequila, love Patron in particular.  Thank you guys so much for saying, come swallow.  Did you have some?  Of course. 
[03:37:00]  You can swallow anytime.  No, somebody pour a drink.  That cup's clean.  The one that's upside down is clean.  Roland, if you could.  Yeah, we ran out of silver Patron, so now we're down to the cup.  And how did we run out of it?  I drank it all.  Is your wife going to be mad at you?  Oh, no, but I shared it with people.  You did.  You had ten shots of the silver.  No, I didn't do ten shots.  Down the head.  Yes, you did.  I was at eight.  No, you did ten.  You did ten.  Heather!  Well, fuck me.  Wow.  Whoa.  Can I point out?  Show that out.  Hey, I'm a good girl. 
[03:37:30]  You're a good girl, Heather.  You can point out whatever you want, Eric.  I want to say something to Heather.  Say something to Heather.  Talk.  Because you're a bit younger than me.  I am.  You may have joined in to the Real World series a little bit later.  Mm-hmm.  Heather, my favorite person on Real World Season 1.  That's incredible!  You were on there with a true story.  I'm going to say, fuck Eric Neese.  Wow.  Wow, fuck him.  Who else?  The country guy, no one gives a shit about.  Who was the comic that dragged?  I know him so well.  That was Season 2. 
[03:38:00]  That was David.  Oh, David Edwards.  And what do you think of David, Iraq?  David's awesome.  Right, but that's Season 2.  And the, uh, what's her name?  I get it.  The girl from, the girl he dragged out on Season 2.  Right, right, Tammy.  Basketball Wives, right?  Yep.  Right.  But let's get back to Season 1.  Season 1, Heather B, superstar.  Number 1 cast member.  Number 1 on that show.  Look.  And what do you say about the grind?  Eric Neese's show.  Fuck the grind.  Are they replaying that?  No.  No.  No one gives a shit about a dance show. 
[03:38:30]  Nobody.  Right.  They replay Pauly Shore when they do retrospectives.  No one gives a shit about the grind.  I have a little secret, though.  They're actually about to rerun Real World 1.  Did you have, hold on a second.  Real World 1.  This girl from Shade 45, did you have something?  I did, I did.  Thank you very much.  You're very welcome.  Okay, I gotta jump back on air, but I'm coming back.  But they're actually about to run Real World 1 on MTV next week.  Marathon Season 1.  Really?  Wow.  I'm an exclusive.  I'll be back to tell you more in a minute.  Okay, thank you, Heather B.  Heather B. 
[03:39:00]  Never rerun those in the years.  Fuck Eric Neese, right?  Yeah, fuck Eric Neese and fuck the country guy.  Yeah.  Although Julie, I think that was her name, the girl from Indiana.  Sure.  She was supposed to be the hot white chick on the show, but as the show progressed for  Season 1, a bit stuck up, a bit religious.  Right.  Killed all kind of hotness for her.  You didn't like it.  You weren't attracted to her anymore.  Heather B.  Kept it real.  Let me ask you something.  Would you have sex with Heather B?  We won't tell her when she comes back, but would you?  Not really in my ... I don't think so. 
[03:39:30]  Is it the body type or the skin color, and that's where we'll leave it?  Skin color is not the issue.  Okay.  I think it's the body type.  Okay.  Fair enough.  We won't make you ... We don't need to insult anybody.  Plus, she's all into Larry Johnson from the ...  Grandmama.  From the Charlotte Hornets.  Now, Sal's in here now.  What do you think?  Eric, you've been in the business for 19 years, like you said.  You were a kid.  Since I was 16.  You were a kid.  Yeah.  I used to lie that I was a college student while I was in high school to work at WBLI 
[03:40:00]  and WBZO B103 on Long Island.  That's what you lied about.  Not to get into clubs.  No, not to get into clubs.  To get in there, to learn promotions, to learn the board, to learn the inner workings of radio  while I was 16.  I said I was in college, and I just never filled out the paperwork.  And that was a lie.  Total lie.  For two years, 16 to 18, total lie.  Total lie.  What do you think when you see guys like Sal walking in here, who not only is having a 
[03:40:30]  rough time finding his spot on this show, but when you do stuff like you did today,  he's basically saying, I would never humiliate myself like Eric did today.  In any other aspect of radio, working for a music channel, or a serious, shut the fuck  up.  No one cares about you.  I'm sorry.  You're just sweating.  For a music channel.  You're trying to talk it up, and you're just fucking sweating.  I know, because you know why?  I'm drunk.  Obviously.  I'm admitting it. 
[03:41:00]  You had ten shots of your tequila, and then three more gloomies.  And you know what that all was for?  A bottle.  What was it for?  You know what that all was for?  What?  For the benefit of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  What an honorable thing to do.  Four hours of content.  What an honorable thing to do.  Where Scott and Todd talk for an hour and seven.  Right.  And don't do shit.  Right.  You know what I did?  I pulled a bunch of audio before the show.  You know how much of it they used?  Zero.  Zero.  You know why?  E-Rot controlled the creative of today's show.  Of me, or new stuff? 
[03:41:30]  In general.  Okay.  News stories and things like that.  Well, then, you know what?  I apologize to you for not using your stuff.  Please.  Because I seem to have bogarted all the time.  Eric, when you come with something that creatively is better than what I have...  I come correct.  It's got to go to you.  You come correct.  Sal's left the studio.  I'm assuming he's in the other room.  Yeah, he is.  I hope you are.  What do you think of the attitude that Sal has?  You were saying in any other...  Well...  Sam, I'm going to put my feet up here since we don't have a visual element and I'm sitting  at Anthony's position. 
[03:42:00]  Be comfortable.  I am.  Look, Sal has a defeatist attitude because...  Opie doesn't like him.  And you think that that is not an on-air bit.  It is.  It does translate to being on-air content.  Mm-hmm.  But behind the scenes, and Opie's notorious for this, where he says one thing, acts a different  way, and then comes on the air and goes, I was lying. 
[03:42:30]  I don't give a fuck about you as a person.  Right.  So he'll be nice to you off the air.  Yeah.  On the air.  It's a different...  Look, nine years I've been on this show, there's been plenty of examples where I've said something  just in passing, or like, hey, this might be an update for you, and it's translated on  the air as, Iraq is vague?  Mm-hmm.  His photos suck?  Mm-hmm.  Or I don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  And you don't like it when they say that you're vague. 
[03:43:00]  I don't like it, but you know what?  What?  It gets them to 10 o'clock.  And that's all it counts.  That's your job, isn't it?  That's my job.  So what do you think of Sal, though?  You think that Opie is the same on the air and off the air with him?  I think Opie acts a certain way to him off-air.  And as we've seen today in that first hour, didn't give two shits about his story.  Now, I will say to this, I will say that I spoke to Sal before the show when he was 
[03:43:30]  talking about the incident with the train, the subway down at 42nd Street, I believe.  Right, Sal?  Yes.  Okay.  When he was talking about that, first thing I said to him was, did you take a photo or  did you get any video?  And he said no because the cops were pushing them off.  What would you have done?  I've learned over the many years I've been on this program that even if the photos suck,  and I know they have, before Sully, when that helicopter crashed in the Hudson. 
[03:44:00]  Sure.  Okay.  Do you remember this?  I remember.  You took photos.  I took photos when parts were washing up near Hoboken.  And you got your balls busted.  Because it was styrofoam.  It was sheet metal.  It wasn't anything that really defined a helicopter crashing.  It was just debris coming up on there.  And I was, you know, taking photos and tweeting that.  Which, by the way, oh, he's not here.  But at that point, Travis had texted me. 
[03:44:30]  I remember this.  Travis had texted me saying, your tweets are great.  And at that point, naive, little Iraq, had said, oh, great, thanks.  Not really thinking ahead to the fact that, one, Travis was being sarcastic.  And then, two.  What was wrong?  I don't know.  Somebody just put a cup of pens next to me.  That, two, that this was going to be utter bullshit for the air. 
[03:45:00]  Well, you don't always know.  You're not the greatest at predicting.  Something happens in your head, and you envision it a certain way.  Back then, I didn't.  You think now you're better?  Now, even if they don't like it, I don't give a fuck.  So, on Tuesday, when you thought up of Tequila Day, is this how you thought it would happen?  Honestly, it ended up that way.  At first, it didn't start the way I thought it would be.  Because I thought Roland would take a shot. 
[03:45:30]  And maybe, I haven't seen Troy all day.  I don't know if he's here or not.  He's not here.  He's not here?  No.  Does the boss know that?  I don't know.  You should definitely tell him, though.  Troy's not here.  We're going to promote that.  But I figured Troy would come in, because, you know, quote Troy Kwan at Twitter, he's down for whatever.  Do you think he really is?  You don't think so?  He is and he isn't.  What do you mean?  He picks and chooses what he wants to do.  But it's not about Troy.  You're right.  Why give him the attention?  I thought Troy would come in, is what I was originally stating, that he would come in and maybe join us, Roland. 
[03:46:00]  And then we'd find a few other people.  So, Anthony didn't want any part of it until 9.30 when he actually took almost the whole part of it.  Which, one, was impressive.  And, two, showed that I have a long way to go if I ever want to compete with that gentleman.  Yeah, I mean, I think this is a...  I'm new to this game.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you still handled yourself pretty well today.  He's, uh...  Anthony is what you call old school. 
[03:46:30]  Why do you think the tears started a little bit towards the end?  The first time, I had no clue that it was even happening.  Yeah.  None.  Yeah, but then, the second time, you kind of knew.  When you were talking about how the show went.  The second time, I think it was because I recognized that it was happening.  And at that point, I couldn't really...  You're in the moment, so you can't really stop it.  So, you think you were crying because you were crying?  I wasn't upset about anything.  Right.  You're feeling good.  I feel fine.  Yeah.  I think it was just that it happened, and I didn't know that it was happening. 
[03:47:00]  Is your wife going to be okay with the fact that you're this drunk on the air?  Look, I'm sure she's not proud of this.  Okay.  Um, she did throw it on Instagram.  She was...  What?  It said, E-Rock Drunk Padada.  She posted a picture.  E-Rock, you should take pride in the fact.  My wife did?  Yes.  So, she's happy.  So, that means it's a good thing.  Well, I mean, no.  She just Instagrammed a photo.  It's still...  Is that true, or are you lying?  No, it's true.  Do you think she's not...  She's not going to be proud of you, but...  I don't think she's...  I don't think she's proud of this particular show. 
[03:47:30]  But she also is one of those people that knows...  It's right there.  Yeah.  Let me see.  It's a picture of the pad data.  Go on, Eric.  Oh, how dare you.  All right, that's funny.  I get it.  Um, well, she retweeted you.  Yeah.  Way to go, Roland.  Uh, Rolandos99 on Twitter and Instagram.  Right.  Um, yeah, she may not be proud of this moment, but she also understands what radio is and  what we actually have to do on the air. 
[03:48:00]  Do you think...  Who understands radio and this show better?  Your wife or Sal?  I would have to say my wife.  She does.  Yes.  Wow.  Sal.  Sal's new to the game.  I'm fucking trying to bring it back to me, Sam.  Just talk to drunk Eric, please.  Why?  Because everyone cares about me.  Yes.  We want to hear from you right now, Eric.  This is one of the best days, most memorable days.  How come you didn't want any part of it?  Why?  Because just let Eric go.  He's producing the show, like you said, and it's hysterical. 
[03:48:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not before when it got in full swing of what I was doing.  Early on, when Ope was asking everybody who's going to partake.  Right.  Um, and turned it down.  Roland wasn't in yet, so he...  No, that's a fair excuse for him.  Uh, you don't drink, Sam.  I don't.  So Sam turned it down.  I've done many other things for the show.  Sal has known to partake, because he does hang out with Troy and Roland.  True.  And we've heard stories about what goes on there.  Troy, I thought, was coming in later, but I guess he's not here today. 
[03:49:00]  But Troy would have partake...  Partaken, sorry.  True.  Uh, if he was here.  So why did you want no part of it, Sal?  I just...  I didn't want to get a talking to or anything like that later on in the show.  You know what I mean?  By who?  Yeah.  By anybody.  Erected...  I didn't want...  I didn't want to...  Erected 13 shots.  You didn't think you...  You thought you...  I didn't do 13.  You did 10.  Before I went to bed...  Uh, bed.  Before I went to the bathroom, you told me it was 10.  And I didn't even think I did 10.  Erected, it was 10 of the silver.  Yeah.  It was three of the Clooney. 
[03:49:30]  And then one of these.  Remember those...  No, he didn't do any of the coffee.  Remember those smooth Clooney shots?  Yeah.  But I thought that was part of the 10.  No.  No.  Look, radio bait aside, you're not petting...  No.  I was counting.  I took a scorecard.  You did 10 plus three of the Clooney shots.  That's a lot of booze.  Pepper did four of the cafe shots.  And Tay-Tay did two shots.  Uh, Tay-Tay did two shots.  Tay-Tay's always good for shots.  But Dennis did three, so Tay-Tay was four.  Just so you know who that other voice is, it's Mashup Nicole from Morning Mashup. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, he's a very good promoter when he's drunk.  On Twitter.  And also my favorite, Heather B, is back.  Heather B?  I had to get my facts straight before I jumped back on you.  But it's true, the real world season one, MTV just hit me.  It is real, uh, real airing.  Re-airing on Friday, March 22nd from 8 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.  They're doing like the old school marathon.  It's very exciting.  Is this MTV or MTV2?  MTV1, the original.  Nice.  It's going to be cool.  That is cool. 
[03:50:30]  That is very cool.  You know, before you got here, Eric said that Heather was his favorite season one cast member.  And furthermore, fuck Eric Neese.  You know what?  I feel that.  Number one was my favorite of all time.  Thank you, Nicole.  Thank you.  Girl, you killed it.  Thank you.  Last time when you left, E-Rock was like, I think maybe three shots deep.  Yeah, he looked okay to me at that point.  What do you think now?  You're very sweet and delicious when you're drunk.  You should get drunk all the time. 
[03:51:00]  You're very mushy and lovable.  You like him, Heather.  I think I can get Nicole at this point.  You do.  You think you could fuck her if you weren't married?  I think so.  Wow.  Nicole.  You do.  Do you think he could?  He's confident.  He's charming.  Do you have to go or no?  Back away.  All right.  Let me give you a hug.  Look at this.  He's lovable.  He almost hit her with his microphone by accident.  That was by accident.  That was unintentional.  But he made up with it with a hug.  No.  He's got no inhibitions.  You're very lovable right now.  I love this.  I'm adorable.  You really are.  Yeah.  Would you, do you think?  If he wasn't married, if you weren't married. 
[03:51:30]  I'm not her type.  Why do you say that?  You're more her type than I am.  How so, Eric?  I'm not, I am outgoing, but I'm not to the extent that you are.  I also don't go into more current stuff as far as like you would go to a Jay-Z concert.  I went, but that wasn't because I wanted to.  I was going because I had a ticket.  You'd be happier going where?  Like Boston or something?  I don't think I'd, besides Jay-Z, the last concert I went to was Lady Gaga. 
[03:52:00]  But you'd prefer, like, if Nicole was like, yeah, we have Jay-Z tickets, Weird Al was  performing the same night.  No, I would never take a date to Weird Al.  You wouldn't.  That's just for me.  That's just something you do.  I'm not sharing that.  You get all fucked up at the Weird Al shows?  No.  You don't?  No, because it's a, you don't.  It's a family that Weird Al.  You should definitely develop a drinking problem.  This is amazing.  You love it, Nicole.  You have the experience.  Tell me about developing a drinking problem.  Well, you know what?  It usually doesn't happen at work.  You usually aren't actually drinking on the air at work.  Yeah. 
[03:52:30]  It's usually before you get to work or at night.  That's key.  Before you get to work.  Right.  Because Nicole has shown up sometimes where we've seen her go down the hallway and we're  like, wow, Nicole's looking a little rough.  Yeah.  But that's from the night before and I've just woken up and I'm a little hung.  Nicole, you, your experience.  Yeah.  After 10 to 13 shots, we'll say, of tequila, what's that hangover going to be like?  It's going to hurt like a motherfucker.  And when does that happen?  I mean, normally a hangover would occur the next morning. 
[03:53:00]  After you fall asleep.  Even if he takes a nap this afternoon, he's going to wake up hung.  Like if you close your eyes for like an hour or two.  Wake up hung.  Hung.  Hung.  Yeah.  Well hung.  Morning BJ's.  That's how you get woken up by Nicole.  Nicole.  Is that what you're implying?  No, but I have been known to do that.  If I'm passed out sleeping and you know what?  Deep REM sleep.  Yeah.  I think it's REM, but.  Oh, REM.  REM.  Well, that's where they got it from.  Right.  Okay.  I don't think your wife's going to want to be my friends anymore if. 
[03:53:30]  No, this is hypothetical.  Hold on.  You don't know that.  But I'm going back to this thing.  Okay.  So if I'm in a deep sleep.  Yeah.  A deep REM sleep, as Sam says.  The way to wake myself or whoever you're with.  I'll throw it to that.  Yeah.  Is a.  BJ.  Morning BJ.  Morning BJ.  Is that right?  Is this something that Matt Ryan is privy to?  Yeah.  He's talking about Nicole's husband.  Of course.  He's a lucky man.  Yeah.  You think so?  If that's what he's getting in the morning.  Not every morning.  God bless him. 
[03:54:00]  God bless him, please.  What's wrong with you?  Not every morning.  But it's definitely a treat that he gets every once in a while.  Okay.  You know what?  Fair enough.  You would accept a morning blowjob from Nicole if you were not committed?  Fair enough that it's a treat to Matt Ryan.  Right.  And if you were not committed and she were not committed, you would accept that from Nicole?  If I was not committed?  If you were not committed, you have a beautiful wife, no disrespect intended to her.  I'd be Sal if I didn't accept it.  You're right.  Sal.  Sal response?  Comment?  That was just to get you to laugh.  Pound it out.  Pound him out.  Pound it out.  Comment, Sal?  I don't even care.  He's just a fucking drunk bovine right now. 
[03:54:30]  Bovine.  Bovine.  You can come with a woman.  You can't.  No.  Was that an SAT word, Sal?  Wow.  You know what wasn't an SAT word?  Coming.  Because that's what Eric does.  Hey, high fives for those of us that can come with women.  Yeah.  Boom.  Me too.  I get one too.  Yeah, you came with a chick.  Yeah.  Oh, he wants a hug.  Yeah.  Can I have a hug too?  High five.  You'll get one later.  How do I get a hug?  She wants a hug.  You want a hug?  Fuck, yeah. 
[03:55:00]  Give her a hug, Eric.  Squeeze in tight.  Squeeze in tight.  Oh, he squeezed it tight.  Did you feel a little tit?  A little.  I tried to push him up.  I didn't grab her tits.  But did you feel a little on your chest?  No, she's got a winter coat on, so you can't really feel it.  But she does smell amazing.  No, that's me.  Sal, response?  I don't care.  Just let Eric talk.  Let him talk.  He doesn't care.  He's defeated.  He's a bit of a bitch.  Because we're talking about girls.  Oh, and so he can't focus?  Yeah.  It's funny, though, that Sal always loves to...  Are you fucking kidding me?  It's 10.51? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, dude.  How are you going to finish the day?  Do you have a live read?  No.  You sure?  Yeah.  I told you that before.  Okay, I'm just making sure.  Sam, can I make a quick announcement?  Yes.  Pizza Friday in my office will happen within an hour.  Pizza Friday.  Nicole, is Nicole invited?  Of course.  He still owes me lunch.  This is it.  This is the lunch.  Pizza Friday.  Eric, you were absolutely, not only the MVP of the day, the MVP of the week.  Sam, I want to apologize for taking up all your air time for After Opie and Anthony live.  I wish I could give you more.  Not Sam on Twitter. 
[03:56:00]  Also your Instagram.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm sorry I took control of your show.  You can have it.  I wasn't intending to.  This is not what I thought tequila and donut day would be, but look where we're at.  Yeah.  And I'll have to say for five hours, huge success.  Huge success.  Unbelievable.  Massive success.  The only one still left making fun of Iraq is Sal because, once again.  Gay.  Well, I was going to say he doesn't get it, but you can say whatever it is. 
[03:56:30]  Nicole, thank you for stopping by.  If you'd like some cafe tequila.  I normally would.  I just, my belly's just not so good.  We should go out on that to make the weekend a complete success.  Are you going to have a shot?  That didn't even make sense.  I really can't.  I will repeat it.  Success.  Success.  All right, Iraq, before we go.  Take a swig of that.  I can.  I will say that.  Iraq.  Iraq.  No, I'm not pregnant.  Are you pregnant?  I am not pregnant.  Nicole is pregnant.  Guess what I have for you.  I can't see it from here.  You love David Letterman.  Justin Stengel.  I love David Letterman.  Head writer, executive producer of David Letterman.  Is he getting any tickets to see David Letterman? 
[03:57:00]  Drunk Iraq is the motherfucking shit.  Justin Stengel.  Give me a photo behind the desk, please.  We go out on that.  Make it happen, Justin Stengel.  Thank you to Iraq for being the MVP of the year.  And we'll see you on Monday.  Ron and Fez are next.  Goodbye. </pre>
