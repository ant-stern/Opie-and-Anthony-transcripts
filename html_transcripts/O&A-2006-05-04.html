<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, calling themselves names like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts."  They then surprisingly welcomed William Donoghue, president of the Catholic League, who wished them well on their return after previous controversies.  Nortonâ€™s graphic recounting of a severe bout of food poisoning, blamed jokingly on Chinese food, dominated a significant portion, punctuated by complaints about the studio's "bassy" microphones.

A substantial segment detailed the misadventures of "No Filter Paul," a crew member.  His disastrous attempt at a cake-throwing prank spiraled into a series of pranks and humiliations culminating in a public defecation incident in Manhattan, later repeated in the studio.  Audio and video of this were reportedly available online. The hosts also recounted humorous anecdotes from their daily walks between studios, including interactions with pedestrians, buying a gay men's magazine ("Honcho"), and unscripted comedy performances at Starbucks that annoyed the staff. They discussed an upcoming Mother's Day stunt involving "Yo Mama" jokes at a cemetery.

A recurring theme was the ongoing saga of "Lady Di," a seemingly homeless and alcoholic woman brought to the studio by Bam.  Her friend Marion called in, detailing Lady Di's struggles, including injuries and precarious living conditions.  The hosts, Marion, callers, and even a detox center representative attempted to convince Lady Di to enter rehab, leading to heated exchanges.  The segment also featured Stalker Patty, who was blindfolded and forced to crawl through a mousetrap-filled field as a pre-test for a planned on-air contest involving crawling through a studio floor littered with mousetraps and cash to win "tool tickets."

Edward Norton called in to promote "Down in the Valley," discussing his acting process and career choices, interspersed with jokes and insults from the hosts and Colin Quinn (who was in-studio along with Dr. Ian Smith).  Later, a caller expressed hope for Lady Di's death after learning of her rehab admittance.  The broadcast included a "minefield of mouth-crap" game with Stalker Patty navigating mousetraps. The hosts' day ended with them throwing money in the air while walking to the studio, encountering Tony Bennett and a woman doing splits for money, culminating with Colin Quinn throwing Jimmy Norton's poster from a window.


Further segments included discussions about the need for new "tender sentiments," smoothies, and XM radio's censorship of the show due to profanity.  Callers frequently used profanity and made crude comments. The hosts discussed an upcoming benefit show, the planned Mother's Day cemetery stunt, FCC censorship, and a German "chicken fucker" audio clip.  A caller weighing 525 pounds triggered a discussion about obesity,  peppered with offensive remarks.  A metal music top 10 countdown was launched but cut short by listener Kevin Huxford's angry email criticizing their work ethic and show length. This led to Opie announcing an early end to the show, provoking angry responses and further arguments.  Billy Connolly, a studio guest, shared anecdotes, and the show ended with unresolved listener complaints, and a partial metal countdown, interspersed with more sexually explicit jokes and the promotion of Connolly's upcoming shows.  The final segments featured the completion of the top three metal songs, a continuation of the heated exchange with Kevin Huxford and other callers, including Elo and Pierre, who sent scathing emails.  The hosts discussed John Montone's critical audio blog on their CBS deal, planned a future "fart contest," a sponsored "Fat Smash Road Challenge" with Dr. Smith, and Anthony mentioning a leaked phone number.  The show concluded with a caller discussing dried apricots and their gas-inducing properties.  Throughout the broadcast,  numerous offensive remarks and profanity were used.  Other guests included Dr. Ian Smith and the mention of upcoming appearances by Billy Connolly. A radiothon for children's charities was also promoted.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. 
[00:00:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donoghue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around hoping grudges with people. You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well.  Push the button. Push the button. 
[00:01:00]  Did you hear me?  Oh, shut up.  Bring it, Anthony.  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow.  We're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat.  Dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that. 
[00:01:30]  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  With hair like Chuck.  Martini Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Roc.  Oh, please, going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My car's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny. 
[00:02:00]  Welcome to the OPNS.  Shut up.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, I love that one.  Are you nuts?  No.  Are you crazy?  That's just a woman that is happy to have us on the air.  You can hear her joy. 
[00:02:30]  The joy in her scream.  Her little squeal.  Good morning.  I see we're all in attendance today.  That's nice.  For the OPN Anthony program.  Here on both XM Satellite Radio and CBS.  CBS.  Yes, it's the virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And it spread throughout Jimmy Norton yesterday morning.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:03:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wacky.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, guys.  We sound very bassy today.  Yeah, I like that.  Every day it sounds a little different.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  All right.  Do you sound bassy?  Yeah.  And it's different from yesterday, right?  You can count on it.  Ha, ha.  Count bassy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I like sounding bassy.  The wacky horn.  Nuff.  Is that good? 
[00:03:30]  You still don't sound bassy.  I want to be bassy.  And they got a lot of bass on our microphones today.  You sound like you have puke voice box.  I stopped throwing up, like, about 24 hours ago.  Did you?  Awful.  Yeah.  Honest to God.  Picture a tube of cookie dough that a bike ran over the middle of.  Is that it?  Both ends.  Both ends?  Awful.  Wow.  I've never had that before.  That's food poisoning, my friend.  It was really weird, man.  I woke up and I felt really sick. 
[00:04:00]  So I went and threw up at, like, 3.30 in the morning.  I went back to bed for a while.  I'm like, yeah, I woke up at 5.15 and I had to do it again.  That's when I called Ben.  I'm like, there's no way I'm making it.  Yeah.  And was it bad Chinese food?  I don't know, man.  I had Chinese food, like, 24 hours before that.  Yeah, we were talking about how the Chinese always get blamed for this.  Yeah.  When you have Chinese food and then you feel sick, you always blame it on the Chinese food.  Yeah, you never blame it on a bad burger.  It's always bad Chinese food or bad sushi.  We were saying yesterday, I hate this fuck. 
[00:04:30]  You stopped it.  No, that wasn't stopped enough.  No.  That'll be our first dump of the day.  Good one.  Good one, Opie.  Well, I don't know.  Why are the microphones different?  I thought you were going to say.  This is so bassy.  It's distracting.  I thought you were going to say fudge.  No, I forgot where I was for a second.  There was some fudge that I ate.  And no, but it was going to be something else.  Every day the studio is different.  Why?  This is really bassy and really annoying.  Is it?  It's really, really annoying. 
[00:05:00]  I hear it being a little bassy.  It's over the top bassy.  Is there some kind of a knob I could turn, please?  What about that anti-bassy button?  See it right there?  Where?  It's not there.  I'm teasing, of course.  Why would there be something as simple as an anti-bassy button?  Remove bassy.  Remove bassy.  It just sounds completely different today than yesterday.  It's tough enough trying to get used to our new surroundings, you know?  But it's distracting.  I'm trying to listen to a little Jimmy Norton story, and the bass is just like, 
[00:05:30]  Whoa.  Maybe turn your volume down a little bit.  Just a little in your headphones.  I tried that.  Yeah, because that kind of helps.  Whatever.  They'll fix it, hopefully, during the break.  Ah, I wouldn't worry about it.  Anyway, yeah.  So they never say, you know, you got sick from, you know, bad hamburger or bad pasta.  You ever see the way Chinese people treat their food in a restaurant?  Like, you peek into the kitchen, and there's just like chicken sitting in a cart next to the door?  Yeah.  They just don't care.  You don't want to look.  No.  Never look in it. 
[00:06:00]  That's why I don't like those restaurants that have the open kitchen, where you can,  as you're eating, you can look in and see them working.  Don't want to see it.  I don't want to know.  I don't want to know who's touching my food, because then you look, and even if it's clean  and everything, you look and go, I don't like that guy, and I don't want him touching  my food.  It could be for many reasons, but...  You know, the best part of yesterday was that I didn't have your little baby wipes  that you like so much.  Oh, no.  Those little soft things.  Yeah.  I didn't have paper either. 
[00:06:30]  I had to use deli napkins.  Oh!  Jimmy.  Deli napkins.  What do you...  You're a big radio star, and you don't have...  I ran out of paper a couple days ago, and I forgot to get it, and I have a stack of deli  napkins, and that's what I was using yesterday.  And those are very, very soft and lovely.  Oh, it's like using a CD.  Might as well use, like, junior high school bathroom paper towels.  Those brown paper towels with wood chunks in them.  Not very delicate.  Dude, it was awful.  And Jimmy called me in the afternoon. 
[00:07:00]  We're going to have to take a break so they can fix this.  This is really distracting.  But Jimmy called me in the afternoon, you know, to tell me what happened, how he was  crapping and puking, and, you know...  Yeah, he had a hard time.  And it lasted, what, like 12 hours, and then it was finally over?  No, not 12 hours.  The throwing up was over in a couple hours, but then it went beyond that.  It was just on the balls.  Yeah.  Constantly.  So he's telling me all the symptoms, and I go, yeah, that's obviously food poisoning.  And he's like, are you sure? 
[00:07:30]  Are you sure?  Like, the panic in his voice.  Like, it finally hit.  Jimmy's, uh...  Like, the virus finally hit him, and this is the first symptom.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  It could be anything.  It could be hepatitis C.  It could be a lot of things.  With his lifestyle of unprotected sex and things like that, you know, hookers.  No.  You could maybe get something that could start off as stomach problems and then escalate  into you weighing 70 pounds, wearing a little tattered robe, having a little puppy dog that 
[00:08:00]  a friend has to come over and care for, and drinking broth.  I did buy broth.  Yeah, chicken broth.  I didn't eat a dog.  How did that feel?  I wouldn't know.  I didn't eat it.  I just put it away.  I'm like, maybe.  You put it away for, well, yeah, you better have it in the house.  I'm not, that's, I mean, girls out there are going to think I'm sickly.  I'm really not.  This was, I knew this wasn't a...  It was food poisoning, but like three or four times on the phone, he's like, are you sure?  Are you sure?  I'm like, yeah, I get that every once in a while.  It stinks.  Because it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be if that was all it was. 
[00:08:30]  You know, a phone call took place many years ago.  Hey, Florence?  Florence Henderson.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm feeling a little, I think it's food poisoning.  I think I had some Chinese food, and yeah, it was just my stomach, and I was throwing up,  feeling very poorly.  Yeah?  You think it's, you don't think it's anything bad, huh?  No, I should be okay.  I bought a robe and some broth.  I didn't drink it, but I just put it away.  Years later, it's like just buying boxes of that broth. 
[00:09:00]  It's all he can hold down.  From Sam's Club in bulk.  He might have thought it was Chinese, but I didn't have an egg roll pounded to my throat.  So I had to convince Jimmy that it was just food poisoning.  But remember when you used to get sick, you just got sick?  I'll explain.  Like when you're younger and a kid, you got sick and you just knew, ah, you're just sick.  But the older you get, every time you get sick, you start wondering, is it the big C?  Is it this?  Oh, is it, you know, someone I may have slept with in the past? 
[00:09:30]  Chiminy Cricket.  Coming back to haunt me.  But you get more, you get definitely paranoid the older you get and every time you get sick.  That is something else.  I knew this wasn't sexual.  I mean, I don't sleep with monkeys.  I just knew that this was something bad.  Well, you do.  Well, you do.  It wasn't that bad.  You have some people visit your apartment late at night that perhaps an exchange might be made.  Fluids. 
[00:10:00]  And it could be a problem, Jimmy.  Not this kind of problem.  This I knew.  When you're sitting there and you're grabbing for the garbage can, which I didn't actually.  Oh, boy.  I did time it out better.  I didn't actually need that.  But it really was the jump and spin around.  And I did gravy leg myself.  Oh, no.  I really did.  Really?  And I thought of that, too, in the moment.  Well, we were looking at some gravy legs yesterday.  We should talk about that after the break because they want to come in here and hopefully adjust the microphones. 
[00:10:30]  Okay?  All right.  We're going to take a very quick break and come back.  Actually, we'll play this going into break in honor of old Jimmy Norton being out sick yesterday.  So check this out.  I was overweight and embarrassed to go any place.  AIDS helped me get back into a size 12.  The AIDS diet plan helped me get back into a size 6.  AIDS helps control your appetite so you lose weight.  Yet AIDS lets you taste, chew, and enjoy.  And the appetite suppressant in AIDS is not a stimulant. 
[00:11:00]  AIDS helped me lose the weight.  It has nothing in it that could make me nervous.  Question.  Why take diet pills when you can enjoy AIDS?  AIDS helps you lose weight safely and effectively.  Use only as directed.  Responsible parents everywhere, Opie and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves.  So take your baby off that windowsill and sit him in front of the radio.  To hear the shriek of a small child, that would be wonderful.  Opie and Anthony Dash, bring in the funny.  Bring in the funny. 
[00:11:30]  Opie and Anthony mornings.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio and now CBS Radio.  I think you're happier with the sound of your microphone.  It's back to normal.  Yeah.  I'm sorry for the outburst.  I'm sorry for the curse.  A little curse got dumped out of, I assume.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  The number, if you're trying to get a hold of us, 1-866-313-FREE, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:12:00]  We've got to update Jimmy.  No Filter Paul came in here yesterday morning.  And I guess the new thing to do with No Filter Paul is just abuse the hell out of him.  Abuse him.  Well, he had it coming to him.  He had screwed up a little bit that we were doing over at XM when he got in the way of  a cake being thrown in Patty's face, Stalker Patty.  And I guess Hawk had the whole thing figured out. 
[00:12:30]  He was going to lay the cake right in her face.  And Paul thought he'd help.  And the guy's incapable of helping, doing anything right except being an idiot.  And he got in the way, and the cake was deflected and missed Patty, for the most part.  Got her a little bit.  And he had to pay for it.  He's been paying for it for the last two or three days on our show.  Yeah.  We stapled stuff into his big, fat gut.  That was fun.  Signs.  Signs.  Right into his belly, yes.  Yeah.  Just stapled into his gut. 
[00:13:00]  And then yesterday, he drank some type of fluid that is used when you're going to get  a colonoscopy to clear everything out.  And it clears you out, like, within a half hour.  Yeah, a half hour of drinking it.  You drink that, and then you drink a bunch of water.  And it, you know, clears the way so the camera could see everything without running into any  obstacles.  So he had to go really badly.  So we had him put a diaper on and join us in the walk from here over to XM. 
[00:13:30]  A couple of blocks down 57th Street, one of the busiest streets in Manhattan.  And he did it.  Got to the studio and then was begging to use the bathroom.  Begging.  And Club Soda Kenny, the big goon that he is, standing by the front door of the studio,  wouldn't let him out.  And it was getting worse and worse.  And we told him, no, there's no way you're leaving the studio without just letting go.  Well, we said, if you could get past Club Soda Kenny, then you could go to the bathroom. 
[00:14:00]  No problem.  Yeah.  But good luck.  So he just sat there begging us.  And then he had that look on his face where it went from fun to, oh, no, I know what I  have to do now.  This is going to be a problem.  So newspapers were put down on the floor.  And about five minutes after that, all hell broke loose.  All hell broke loose.  Release the hounds.  It just, what a complete and utter disgusting mess that was all over the newspapers. 
[00:14:30]  And the poor interns had to clean up.  It was really bad.  If you had any guts, when you wouldn't let him out, he should have just taken the diaper  off and said, all right, well, then let's really enjoy this.  Right.  Well, he did it live on Pal Talk.  The video is up on one of our websites.  We can't promote any websites yet, but it's out there.  Yeah.  Steve filmed it.  The video is out there for you sickos out there.  You just put it out.  Opie and Anthony in Google.  Do a Google search of our name.  A bunch of sites come up.  Just pick a few and you'll see some stuff. 
[00:15:00]  Why can't we promote the sites?  We're working on it.  Okay.  We're working through it.  It's a work in progress.  We're working through it.  Well, because we do two shows every day.  This is the first half of the show.  And then the second half of the show is on XM, okay?  And we want to play this perfectly.  So we don't want the people that are only listening to the first half feel like they're missing stuff.  Yeah.  So if you find some of our websites, that'll really, really help.  Because if anything crazy goes on over there, there is video of it, okay?  Right.  Because we definitely don't want you missing out.  We want everyone to get along here, okay? 
[00:15:30]  You know, I missed the live actual â€“ I wasn't looking at Paul when he finally let loose.  I was looking at the PalTalk camera on my computer monitor.  So I saw it that way.  What was even more fascinating was all the people that I have popped up on their separate videos on PalTalk,  we run PalTalk and people have cameras in our studio.  We have cameras in our studio and they can see what we're doing.  But the fun thing is they also have cameras at their house so we can watch them. 
[00:16:00]  So we punch up various girls and stuff like that and they do things during the show.  It's a lot of fun.  Now, every girl was disgusted where they had their hands over their mouths and hands on their stomachs like they were absolutely ready to puke.  I've never seen so many girls so disgusted.  It was terrific, Jimmy.  I've never laughed harder.  I never laughed harder and I was begging for it to stop because I couldn't laugh anymore.  You ever get one of those laughs where you just need to stop laughing? 
[00:16:30]  I felt like I was doing an ab workout.  And then the studio got so bad, you got the gift of the Godiva chocolate coffee and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  I had to rip open a bag of coffee, pour it in a cup, just the grounds, and stick my nose in the coffee cup for about an hour.  What are you, cologne shopping?  I needed to just get rid of the smell in the studio.  You think that's bad.  I mean, when he let loose and it splashed and sprayed all over the newspaper on the floor, I just got out of the way right in time. 
[00:17:00]  Just in the nick of time.  Yeah, because it wasn't like three, two, one, go.  There was no countdown.  No.  He just let loose.  It was like you ever been out on the golf course or in the field at the school and the sprinklers come on just out of nowhere and all of a sudden you're like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, over here.  It was unbelievable.  And the smell.  All right, all right, Kenny. 
[00:17:30]  They're dumping out like crazy, I would imagine.  Yeah, you can't be.  You've got to be very careful how you describe it.  I think everyone out there understands what happened.  They have a clue.  He was in a diaper standing in the studio and, you know, just use your imagination or go find the video on one of our fine websites.  But before that, he was walking the streets of Manhattan with just a diaper on.  And the looks, you know, it's really tough to get people in Manhattan to look at you.  People were definitely looking finally yesterday.  Yeah, finally we found something that people will stop their little trek to work and turn and look at and comment on and look out the windows of buildings. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  But there's something very interesting going on every day, too.  Like I said, we do two radio shows.  And after this show ends, right at around, I don't know, 850 or so, we try to push it as close to nine as possible.  The whole crew just packs up and we get out of here.  And then we broadcast for XM only from this studio to the other studio.  And we're walking the streets of Manhattan.  And every day the crowds are getting bigger and bigger and more people are checking us out as we broadcast and walk the streets of Manhattan. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And you see people in their office windows above now, you know, staring down at us as well.  So what we got today is just a couple highlights from some of the walks we've done in the last week.  Just a few highlights.  Because once again, I don't want this half of the show feeling like they're missing stuff.  Yeah.  So from time to time, we're going to bring some stuff from the second half of the show over to here so everyone can enjoy. 
[00:19:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  The goal is to meld the two shows into a single entity.  That's right.  And in time, that'll happen.  It's a very, very tough project we took on.  But we're going to make it work.  This is brand new.  This is pioneering radio.  It's a tall order.  Right.  It certainly is a tall order.  So, you know, real quick bits that Nathaniel put together from our walk from one studio to the other.  The first clip is good old little Jimmy Norton buying a magazine from the newsstand. 
[00:19:30]  Ooh.  Listen to this.  This was, you know, live on the radio.  Hi, sir.  Do you sell any men's magazines like Playgirl?  We do.  All right.  How much for a magazine with **** in it?  That's like $8, $9 different prices.  All right.  Let's get one of those.  The darker, the better.  Take this, anyone.  Oh, let's take a look, Jimmy.  All right.  There's man date.  Which is your top seller?  Honcho is the best one.  Where's honcho for pizza?  It's over there.  That's right. 
[00:20:00]  Honcho.  A hundred percent stud meat.  Real men, real naked.  How much for a honcho, fella?  Where do the bagpipes go, by the way?  Hold on.  This is embarrassing without the bagpipes.  Hi, sir.  Great.  All right.  Can I buy this?  Oh, sure.  He's going to get that.  A bunch of men.  Just look at other men.  All right.  Thanks, fella.  Godspeed.  I think you should have went for all boy, Jimmy, myself.  No, honcho is the way to go.  We all know that.  Jimmy actually bought honcho.  Why wouldn't I?  Let's look at it as we're walking down the street.  All right.  Get that band to play. 
[00:20:30]  Otherwise, it feels silly.  Yeah, without the band, buying honcho feels a little silly.  Without the band, I'm not doing a radio bit.  I'm just a faggot.  You're just shopping.  It's just a normal day for Jim Norton without the bagpipes.  No, it's not, Opie.  We had the bagpipes helping us out that day, and we got one of those Mexican bands on Friday.  A mariachi band?  Yeah, they're going to help us with the walk on Friday.  With that big, fat guitar.  So the next clip, really fast.  These are quick clips.  Jim is now in Starbucks.  We decided to bring the bagpipes into Starbucks while everyone was getting their coffee. 
[00:21:00]  The line was all the way out the door, and there's a woman in line near the back of the line,  and Jimmy just decides to cut her, I believe.  I don't know if I cut her or she cut me.  She was trying to cut you.  And I think to set up this clip, she's kind of mad that Jimmy cut her in line,  so Jimmy decides it's a perfect opportunity to open up the honcho magazine right there in Starbucks.  This is a long line.  Ben is trying to get us to the front of the line.  That ain't going to work.  What do you look at, lady?  It's going to annoy people. 
[00:21:30]  Jimmy, the lady right there is really, really annoyed.  Who cares?  Oh, look at Kenny.  I'm not cutting this.  I'm not cutting the line.  This is New York City.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not cutting that line.  I don't cut lines.  I'm not that brave.  Talk to that lady, though.  She's really annoyed.  Wow.  You can go to the front of the line.  Miss, you just cut me.  This lady just cut me.  Well, just have Ben.  I was reading honcho.  Ben, just give me a grande cappuccino skim milk dry.  Kenny, order that for me.  Jimmy, Jimmy's reading his honcho, and there's a girl right behind him. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, and he goes, you just cut me in line.  And then she went behind him, and he opened up his honcho to one of the worst pornographic gay pages I've ever seen.  All right, I guess we've got to set the scene.  We're showing honcho.  We're at Starbucks.  Jimmy, are you?  Oh, that's a nice one, right?  They usually don't show Johnny.  No.  No, Johnny doesn't really show. 
[00:22:30]  That's a good one.  He's not known for showing.  Yeah.  I love the fact that that band is just playing in the background for no reason.  And no one has had their morning coffee yet, so they're just miserable in line.  They're all irritated.  And, you know, the lady was just disgusted that you're showing her, you know, the centerfold of the honcho magazine.  Paul unclipped, gentlemen.  All right, we've got two more clips, and then we'll move on here.  I think this is from yesterday.  Club Soda Kenny, during the walk, decided to interview an old lady that was checking out no-filter Paul in the diaper. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I guess you guys were getting some of those.  A couple old bags decided to stop and chat for some reason.  They see microphones, and they want to feel like they're actual humans still.  All right.  Miss, what do you think's going on here?  I have no idea.  What do you think of this?  I think it's very peculiar.  What do you mean?  Peculiar.  Well, I don't know why he's standing there wearing a diaper.  Can you describe him?  Well...  Don't hold back.  It's okay.  He's a little overweight. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, he's fat.  And you're a little old.  I don't like to use that word.  Yeah, she's being nice.  And I think he could get in shape very easily.  He is in shape.  The shape of a destroyer.  Do you know that he just drank fleet enema, and something may be pouring out of him any  second?  That's why the diaper.  I think I want to continue this conversation.  Aw.  Okay, well, have a nice day anyway. 
[00:24:00]  By the way, your mom is so dead.  She's sweet.  She was sweet.  She was sweet.  I'm going to try to get her number.  She's walking away.  We're doing the Your Mama Is So Dead thing.  Oh, broad.  Yeah, we haven't even told Jimmy Norton what we want to do for Mother's Day.  Oh, yeah.  We want to go to a cemetery, and we want Rich Voss, and Bill Burr doesn't seem like he's  too into it.  No.  So maybe Patrice O'Neill.  Like, just hang out at a gravestone, and tell your mama jokes.  And play Yo Mama. 
[00:24:30]  See, because Mother's Day is a big day at the cemetery.  A lot of people visiting Mom, you know?  And then have them in front of a tombstone, telling the Yo Mama jokes, with an earshot  of some people, maybe, that are there.  Good luck with that bit.  There's not many people that see it our way out there.  No one's really supporting this one.  Let's go to No Filter Paul and get an update.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Trying to keep it clean. 
[00:25:00]  How was the rest of your day?  Yeah, Paul, please.  Let's see how...  I bet he says something stupid in seconds.  Without even cursing.  Right.  Go ahead, Paul.  Okay.  I dumped 18 times, and it finished at about quarter past 12 last night.  I don't know if that made the radio.  I don't either.  I think he's an idiot.  I think everybody thinks he's an idiot.  Just in case they dumped out, let's just say 18.  18.  18.  He had to take 18 breaks. 
[00:25:30]  18.  18 in his day to satisfy the liquid that he drank.  How are you feeling this morning there, Paul?  I think he's okay now, finally.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Did you lose any weight?  I didn't get on the scale, but definitely.  Definitely.  He's got that gut on him.  It's amazing.  That is really amazing to look at.  The rest of your body is pretty slender.  Your legs and your arms and your chest, and your gut is just awful.  Uh-huh. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Paul.  Thanks for the call.  Appreciate it, Paul.  Jesus.  Great job.  How about some energy?  We're doing morning radio.  If you're going to be on the show, try to have some energy.  A little bit of pep.  Just a little bit.  Finally, one more from yesterday.  Rich Voss was sitting in for Jimmy Norton, and we decided he should do some comedy at Starbucks.  And I think this is the last time we're going to be in Starbucks, because they got really annoyed yesterday.  I guarantee they have some type of security or something.  If we continued to do this, we would get arrested.  Yeah, one of the ladies behind the counter got right into Voss' face when he tried to do his comedy. 
[00:26:30]  So we got some audio of this.  Basically, we were outside, and we told Kenny just to run into Starbucks and just introduce their next comedian like it's a comedy club.  Here's from yesterday.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Coming to the stage, your next comic.  You've seen him on Last Comic Standing.  Let's give him a warm Starbucks welcome for Mr. Rich Voss.  Let him hear it, folks.  Rich Voss, everybody.  How are we doing?  Rich Voss.  Thank you.  It's good to be here.  I'm from Jersey, and we had a gay governor, which is great, because he fixed up all the rest areas. 
[00:27:00]  I have two.  How are you guys doing?  Are you from China?  Don't cough near me.  Anyhow, I have two daughters, 15 and 13.  I was, no, hold on.  I'm just doing five minutes.  I got an audition.  Just five minutes.  All right, two minutes.  Two minutes.  This is a big set for me right now, because if I do well here, I get to work Dunkin' Donuts.  So just let me do two minutes.  That's all I need. 
[00:27:30]  The customers love it.  They got to go to work.  They want to go with a smart.  Look at these two ladies loving me.  Stop working the crowd.  I got a car.  I got a car.  All right, here's the thing.  I got two daughters, 15 and 13.  I was divorced when they were really young, and they took it tough, because I remember telling  them it was their fault.  That's a nice bag, sir.  Did that come with a b**** in your mouth?  Thank you.  I think we better wrap this up.  You guys were a great crowd.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thanks.  They were good.  How great is that? 
[00:28:00]  He got nothing.  How great is that?  Did he say a piece of gum?  Yeah, that was it.  A piece of gum.  Yeah.  He got nothing.  He's telling his jokes, and people are just looking horrified at him.  He was chain smoking the whole way to Starbucks.  You Chinese, don't cough near me.  Yeah, don't cough near me.  Well, it was a whole table of Asians, and they were just looking bewildered.  I had no idea what was going on.  That face they make where they're all bewildered.  Yeah.  It's the same one as when they're happy.  You just can't tell.  My God.  Are you bewildered or screaming for fear of your life? 
[00:28:30]  No one can tell right now.  Is that a yawn or a yell for help?  He bombed.  So anyway, that's just a sample.  I mean, every day we do the walk, and we broadcast it, and every day we try to do something different.  Yeah.  I was hoping that Anthony was going to give me my $100 from the bet yesterday, because  I was just going to throw the $100 up in the air.  Really?  Yeah.  No.  I can't give you that $100 if you're just going to throw it away.  Why?  I have the best idea for today, for today's walkover. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  First of all, American Idol last night, they voted Paris off.  Yeah.  I said they would definitely vote Paris off.  You said they would vote Elliot off.  You had a choice.  Huh?  You said it was either Paris or someone else.  No, I just said Paris.  Yeah.  Yeah, I said Paris without a doubt.  You were cheating, though.  You were using the poll in the USA Today.  Yeah.  I have a feeling you're not going to give me my $100.  No, I'm welshing on this one.  Why?  I just feel like it's time to welsh on a bet. 
[00:29:30]  But see...  I don't have it on me.  See, if you gave me the $100 that I won yesterday, I was going to make it into one.  And then later this morning, I want Club Soda Kenny, who's 6'6", Kenny?  Yes, sir.  6'6".  I wanted him to skip and throw money as he skips.  Ooh.  Down the street.  That would be nice.  Well, we just need the $100.  If only I had it on me.  We just need the $100.  I have like...  I think I got about $15 on me.  That's it.  That's less climactic.  It really is.  That's over in one throw. 
[00:30:00]  That's like one skip.  And that's done.  You need more than $100, though, if you're going to skip from here all the way down to the place.  $100.  The way he...  You know, because Kenny will throw like $60 and $50.  No, it's got to just be both hands, just ones flying as he skips.  You have $100.  That goes pretty quick, both hands.  You know what?  I'll just go to the ATM and get $100 then.  Because I want to do this now.  I want to see Club Soda Kenny...  Who's selling drugs?  Opie is selling drugs or something.  I want to see Club Soda Kenny skip up the sidewalk this morning and just throw dollars as he goes. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Who doesn't want to see that?  I want to see it.  At least give me $50 of the $100.  And I'll do the other $50.  $15?  $50!  I have $15 on me.  I'd have to go to the ATM.  I'll throw in $20.  And then where do we get the single?  You'll throw in $21?  Yeah.  We have to go to the bank then because we need singles.  Well, why don't we just collect the $100.  Someone go get the ones and then we'll figure out who owes what later.  I got three, four...  I got four ones so far. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, Jesus.  I got five, six, seven, eight ones.  That's more like the old Opie.  And a 10.  And I got a 10.  Just, uh...  Because the fans are outside every day.  Okay, so we'll treat them to Club Soda Kenny skipping and throwing dollar bills on the streets of New York.  I got six, Bill.  Ha, ha, ha.  I got a $100 bill here.  Ooh.  That's how I travel. 
[00:31:30]  Someone go get a hundred ones.  They call him Jimmy Hundred.  That's what my nickname is.  Jimmy Hundred.  Here's some singles.  Yeah, here.  Throw these singles in the pot, too.  It's not money.  I'm contributing $20.  I'd like the other $80 in $20 bills.  Here, here.  Post-1985.  Here, Jimmy.  Take a 10 back so he could...  Well, whatever.  Just try to get a hundred ones for later on this morning.  I want $80 back, Bill.  I'm going to whip your calves.  How great will that be?  Kenny skipping.  He's got a suit on and throwing dollars as he goes.  That's nice. 
[00:32:00]  All right.  Let's go to Ed in New Jersey.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, man?  How are you?  Well, Ed.  Pretty good.  My girlfriend and her friend were pretty interested in getting that tool ticket, man.  What did I have to go through to get it?  Ah, we got that going on.  Well, first of all, Stalker Patty, is she here yet?  She is.  We're waiting for Stalker Patty to show up.  We got a hundred mousetraps.  She's going to try out the mousetrap thing today to make sure it's going to work.  A little test run.  And then we're going to work out the kinks.  And then tomorrow, we're inviting listeners down.  I think we can invite a few more people down. 
[00:32:30]  So hold on the line, Ed.  And basically, we want your girlfriends or wives to crawl around the studio blindfolded,  either naked or in panties and bra or whatever they want to do.  Semi-clad.  Semi-clad so the video looks good.  And they'll crawl around the floor amongst mousetraps and more cash, by the way.  I think we're getting like $500 cash for that.  And throwing it all over the studio.  And the mousetraps are going to be all over the studio.  And somewhere within this whole mess will be the tool tickets. 
[00:33:00]  They are so...  It's actually my girlfriend and her friend.  They're really excited about it, man.  Well, you might want to listen to the show a little later when Stalker Patty gets here  and tries it out because it's pretty horrific.  How do they look?  Well, my girlfriend's definitely a dime, man.  Her friend ain't doing too bad herself.  Oh, yeah?  A dime.  Will they get naked?  She's saying, how do I look?  I'm fucking hot.  Oh, dude.  You can't wait.  Do you understand?  I love tools. 
[00:33:30]  Watch your language.  She loves tools.  She's screaming in the background.  All right.  Well, will she get naked?  Yes, she will.  All right.  Okay.  She will.  Who, who, who?  Cool.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We'll get your info.  Thanks, boys.  Yeah, we should be getting Stalker Patty in here hopefully in the, I don't know, the next  15, 20 minutes and we'll try it out because we've got a very busy show.  Colin Quinn's coming in.  Okay.  Edward Jimmy Norton will be on the phone.  Ed Norton.  Edward Norton, yeah.  We've got to call him Edward, though. 
[00:34:00]  Edward, yeah.  We have to call him Edward.  Because Ed Norton is, you know, Ralph Cramden.  Yeah, that was the only request they made.  It's fine.  So, uh...  I met Eddie.  He has a new movie out called Down in the Valley that I watched last night, so it's  really, really good.  Yes.  So he'll be checking in today as well.  Let's go to Rob in White Plains.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  What's wrong with you?  You've got to make good on that bet.  Everyone heard it, Anthony.  Well, sir, were you listening on XM before FM, or what do you listen on? 
[00:34:30]  I've been listening to XM.  I bought my Honda five months ago, and I listened to you guys way before that on NDW.  All right.  And Anthony, I know Opie's the cheap one, but I think the roles are being reversed right  now, and I'm not a fan of it.  You know, I'm wondering if it's the neighborhood I've moved into.  Perhaps it's rubbing off on me.  You know, I've moved into a...  I know what's right is right, and you've got to make good on that bet.  Moved into a completely Jewish neighborhood.  And now I'm being a little thrifty with my money. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, because I threw some money to the boys to clean up what No Filter Paul left behind.  Because I felt like they shouldn't do that for free as interns.  Yeah.  How much do you give them?  At least throw a few singles in for the skipping bit later on this morning.  Okay.  I'll make good.  You don't have to make good on the whole hundred.  At least, like, split this thing we're doing with Kenny.  Stupid American Idol.  Stupid show with their stupid voting. 
[00:35:30]  Wrong.  $36 million a year.  Does he?  I was on Drudge today.  $36 million a year he's making.  To do that show?  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Hey, is Stalker Patty here?  We're going to take a break.  Oh, she is here.  Can she come in and say hi real fast?  Oh, with that voice.  Hi.  How are you this evening?  Here she comes.  Is she working today?  She's walking really slowly into the studio here in New York.  The best one.  The free FM studio.  We were trying to get her to grab the hog the other day, 
[00:36:00]  and she kept saying,  But I'm a lady.  I have a reputation.  I have a reputation.  No, you don't.  She is a 51-year-old.  I think she's 51 now or something like that.  51-year-old virgin.  All right.  For the first time in four years,  for a lot of people listening out there,  it's Stalker Patty.  Come here, Stalker Patty.  Patty, what the hell are you?  You're walking like a crip.  Get on that mic.  I think it's getting to the point with Stalker Patty.  Every time she comes into her studio now, 
[00:36:30]  she gets really scared.  Yeah, she's scared.  Because we have really messed her up  in the last few appearances on the show.  We've conditioned her to just be fearful  to walk into her studio.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  How are you?  Oh, just wonderful.  I spent 20 minutes trying to figure out how to come in.  There was nobody working the desk,  and there was no way to make a phone call  because it didn't know the number.  Nobody working the desk.  Nobody making a phone call.  It wasn't the fact that someone walked out. 
[00:37:00]  I was like, oh, hi, I'm Patty.  But you're a Stalker.  You should have had all this figured out way in advance.  I guess I'm a stupid Stalker.  Well, no one's going to disagree with that old chick with teeth.  Well, you don't have to agree with me.  Hey, Patty, today you're taking one for the team.  You know that, right?  There's nothing in it for you.  There's nothing today.  Yeah, you're not getting anything for this.  Except maybe some radio fame.  It's just your return to the FM airwaves, really.  Yeah, we gave you $70. 
[00:37:30]  I gave most of that, too.  What?  The $70?  When?  When we made believe we broke her glasses  and threw the cake at her and all that?  And the Jim Norton hand thing?  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  Oy vey.  Anyway, Patty, this is what's going to happen.  You're going to...  Ugh.  You're kind of going to disrobe.  What?  She's going to disrobe? 
[00:38:00]  That's a good way to put it.  And we're going to put a blindfold on you.  And we're going to have fake tool tickets amongst mousetraps.  Fake tool tickets?  And you're going to like...  Because she's like our test subject.  We're in the Opie and Anthony lab right now.  We have to have Stalker Patty try it out.  See what the bugs are and fix it before the contestants do it tomorrow.  Yeah.  So all we need you to do is crawl around the floor naked, blindfolded,  trying to find the fake tool tickets amongst a mere hundred mousetraps. 
[00:38:30]  Some of the traps may be set too tight,  so we need you to crawl around and just see how much bone damage they actually do when they go off.  Yeah.  Well, those would be the rat traps.  There will be a few rat traps.  There could be a couple of knuckles cracked, but you could work with, like, broken fingers, right?  I don't want any broken fingers.  No, but you could work with broken fingers over at...  Where do you work?  Starbucks?  I guess so, but it doesn't mean I want to break anything.  All you need is, like, a thumb and forefinger to hold a coffee cup. 
[00:39:00]  Your middle, your ring finger, and your pinky could be off, really.  You don't even need them to work at Starbucks.  Well, the last time I did mousetraps, the red marks went away in two days.  I had sore knuckles for two days.  Two days.  All right, well, let's take a break.  Bring in the mousetraps.  Bring in the mousetraps.  Start setting them.  I'm so happy when he says that.  I can't set mousetraps. 
[00:39:30]  They give me the heebie-jeebies.  I just got a communique from Ben.  Oh, yes.  And usually we would try to argue this point and jump up and down and scream and yell, but I'm fine with this.  Has to be bra and panties.  Has to be.  That's fine with me.  I got no problem with that.  Who cares?  I've seen stalker patty naked enough.  And you know what?  There's plenty of opportunity for nude debauchery elsewhere.  That's right.  Because with patty, I don't even want to see it anymore. 
[00:40:00]  I don't even want to see it anymore.  It should be with winter coat and hat and even more clothes.  Yeah.  A parka.  I'm not that bad.  All right, listen.  Of course not.  We're taking a break.  Bring in the guys with the mousetraps.  Set up the studio.  It's a large, large studio.  Yeah.  We got to get some kind of playing field between the wall and where we're broadcasting.  Plenty of room right back here.  That's got to be at least 15 to 20 feet all the way to the wall.  So there's going to be kind of a minefield of mousetraps.  We'll set that whole thing up and we'll do it next on the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:40:30]  Robe.  Soup.  Tears.  Poodle.  Robert Reed.  And repeat.  And repeat.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Yeah, you're checking out the O&A virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Write that number down if you got something for the program.  We got Stalker Patty over there. 
[00:41:00]  Just say hi, Stalker Patty.  Oh, that's another mic.  It doesn't matter.  Okay.  Hey, geeks rejoice.  Geeks rejoice.  As can George Lucas.  In September, fans can look forward to the long-awaited DVD release of the original theatrical  incarnation of the Star Wars trilogy.  Do you believe this son of a bitch is putting out Star Wars now without the extras that he 
[00:41:30]  put in and Han Solo shoots first in the bar instead of Greedo shooting and how he made  it where the bounty hunter shot at Han first so Han Solo wouldn't look like a bad guy by  shooting first?  Yeah.  Altered the film, put in a bunch of CG creatures and stuff, and a bunch of people, Star Wars  purists, you know, geeks.  They complained about it, and he said, well, this is it.  This is the vision.  It's an evolving thing because of the technology.  I'm allowed to do this.  It's my movie. 
[00:42:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Well, more money from the same movie this bastard is in September putting out, and it's  going to make a fortune again.  And you're going to have to buy it.  You'll have to buy it.  If you're a collector, you've got to buy the same movie, what, 10 different times now?  Congratulations.  This guy's figured out how to make more money off the same damn movie.  He's a cornball, and his movies were actually good.  But enough with the dumb characters.  Characters sucked.  The little, that stupid cantina band.  I hated that. 
[00:42:30]  I don't think I've ever hated anything in a movie.  That's a very famous scene, though, Jimmy.  I know, and it's awful.  You know what's the famous scene?  The rape scene from I Spit on Your Grave.  That's also a famous scene.  What's it mean?  I don't know.  It's more enjoyable for you, Jimmy, to watch.  It just has more integrity than that.  That character sucks.  That marketing for children.  I mean, like, five-year-olds.  The Ewoks.  Ugh.  Yeah, when they got to the Ewoks, I'm pretty much done.  He created the greatest bad guy probably in movie history. 
[00:43:00]  It was Darth Vader.  Nobody better than Darth Vader.  Yeah.  And Dracula, Frankenstein.  All right.  But then he'd throw those little faggoty, cornball, awful Muppets.  And then to have to wrap up the ending all nice, and where Darth Vader's all nice.  And bald, and looking like Donald Pleasance.  Who saw that coming?  Not me.  He's supposed to be a monster, but he's all like a really sweet guy.  Yeah.  Grandfatherly.  And then they're all ghostly looking over at Luke.  Oh, hi, Luke.  We're all together now. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh, thank the Lord.  Stop.  Sucked.  Hey, this just in.  Lady Di is here.  Yeah, Lady Di is here.  Homeless Lady Di.  We haven't seen her in four years.  She used to do a lot of things for our radio program.  She's fallen on bad times, very bad times.  She's, like, living behind a pathmark in Jersey, hanging out with the other homeless.  Homeless over there.  And having sex with the homeless.  With the Railroad Romeo that they call this guy.  He seems to be the hit of the homeless up there behind Pathmark where the train platform is. 
[00:44:00]  And they call him the Railroad Romeo.  And she's kind of hooked up with that guy.  And everyone's saying, wait till you see her.  We haven't seen her in four years.  And they're saying she looks absolutely awful.  She's always been a fat mess.  Oh, my God.  That's her?  She's coming into the studio right now for the first time in four years.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Lady Di.  First of all, no, no, no.  Somewhere else.  What?  Ant, there's a mic next to you.  Stop it.  I said, Ant.  No.  Nope. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, stand way over there.  Right there is good.  We can see it.  Right there by the light switches.  Hi, Di.  Over there.  Hi, how are you?  Back there.  How are you?  Back there.  Who are you?  By the light switch.  Against the wall.  There you go.  So we can see it.  Right there so we can see you in the light.  Okay.  That mic's not on.  It's not?  We're trying to figure out which one's that one.  We just get her on a mic that we know works.  Oh, my God.  We have like 15 mics in here.  We still can't figure out which one's.  I'm going to go over here.  Or what yet?  I'm moving over here.  There we go.  How you doing, guys?  What's up, lady guy? 
[00:45:00]  You look good?  Yeah.  I look wonderful.  Right.  We got to start the death pool on you.  Wow.  Yes.  Get on the microphone more.  Okay.  Your face is bloated from the alcohol.  Bloated and red.  And red.  What's with the red?  That's not sunburn.  The red is the sun.  That's what that is.  The sun?  The sun.  Yeah.  That's what that is.  She's been in the Hamptons sunning.  And your hair is really greasy.  Your hands look like cadaver hands. 
[00:45:30]  They're all dirty.  Look at the dirt under your fingernails.  Look at all the dirt under your fingernails.  You said you wash up.  What happened?  Yeah, I do wash up.  Well, how are your fingernails all dirty?  That'll still happen.  No, it won't.  It doesn't happen if you stay clean.  Look, we all wash up.  Look, there's nothing happening under our fingernails.  It doesn't happen if you stay clean.  What are you doing?  What are you pointing at, Iraq?  What are you doing?  This isn't even a radio bid anymore.  What are you doing to get better?  Stop.  I told you. 
[00:46:00]  I'm going to the...  I'm going to try to go back to the SAI program.  When?  So this way they could find me.  When?  Very soon.  When?  Very, very soon.  When?  You're not.  You're saying very soon.  Very soon means nothing.  Probably tomorrow.  I have to go back.  No, probably doesn't work either.  Oh, okay.  What happened to your bling?  Why didn't you go today?  Why didn't you go yesterday?  Because I have to make an appointment with this lady to go.  What?  So it's probably going to be today.  Probably means you're not going to do it. 
[00:46:30]  No, I will do it.  I have to go back to West.  You're not a good adult friend.  You're not a good liar.  You're not good at it.  Yeah, you haven't gotten good at it yet.  Yeah.  Probably not.  You've been rousted by the cops yet?  No.  No.  You've got to learn how to lie if you're going to be rousted by the cops.  Mm-hmm.  I see that on episodes of Cops.  It's pretty good.  And they're all horrible liars.  And you're tugging at your hair.  Your hair is turning into like dreadlocks.  You look like Eddie Vedder in 1992.  If Eddie Vedder was punched in the face a few times, you've been mugged. 
[00:47:00]  I'm going to do something about this.  No one believes you in this studio.  You know that, right?  No.  Just like your own family, no one believes you anymore.  I'm going to have to prove it.  No one believes you.  Marion doesn't believe you.  Even Marion gave up on you.  How old is your son?  My son right now is 15 years old.  That's good.  So, he's doing good.  He's staying with my dad.  Of course he is.  I don't think he feels about this.  He doesn't feel too good about this.  I'll tell you that.  You're a homeless embarrassment.  Why don't you stop it? 
[00:47:30]  I am going to stop it.  Why don't you stop it?  I am going to stop.  Have you had anything to drink today?  No.  Kenny, has she had anything to drink?  The booze is emanating off her person.  Yeah.  Really?  No joke, right?  It'll be off my jacket, but not off of me.  What about last night?  Last night, yeah.  You were drinking?  I had a few drinks last night.  A few drinks with the boys, right?  Yeah.  Down there at the train station platform thing?  Any sex last night?  No.  No sex last night. 
[00:48:00]  Any drugs last night?  No.  Jimmy, is she on drugs too?  I can't tell.  No.  No, I'm not.  I can't tell.  I don't do that.  You're not smoking pot?  No.  That fat face.  At the very least, you're smoking pot.  You're smoking lots of weed and drinking yourself to an early death.  What happened to you?  Do you see what has happened to you?  Do you see how you have fallen from, you know, we would goof on you and all, but at least  you were employed.  You had a home.  You still had your kid with you.  Right.  And now look where you are.  How did that happen? 
[00:48:30]  How did it happen?  I don't know.  No, don't say you don't know.  You lived it.  How did it happen?  Give us the process here of the chain of events that led you to be here like this.  Okay.  This is what happened.  All right.  I winded up falling behind on my rent.  How?  Okay.  Well, I was working at Dunkin' Donuts and I had to pay like over a thousand dollars a  month plus utilities and everything.  I couldn't afford it anymore.  How did you lose your job before Dunkin' Donuts? 
[00:49:00]  Didn't you have a good job?  Yes, I did.  And what happened?  I lost it.  How?  They were cutting back over there and I was one of the people that they cut back with.  Do you really, you tell, like you tell other people this stuff, but do you actually  buy it when you say it?  Well, it's the truth.  They just let me go.  That was it.  So how about this?  It was my fault, too.  That part was my fault, too.  What part was your fault?  What did you do wrong?  Well, you know, not showing up for work and everything like that. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Well, that will get you fired.  Now, why weren't you showing up for work?  What's up, Kenny?  I'm just laughing at what a pity she is.  Why weren't you showing up for work?  I wasn't showing up for work because I would stay up late at night.  Doing what?  Go on the computer and stuff like that.  Go on the computer.  Stop acting like you were Googling things.  You were drunk.  Just admit that it was your drinking.  Your drinking has led you to where you are. 
[00:50:00]  See, that's the whole point we're getting to.  You weren't programming things at two in the morning and you got caught up sending DOS files.  Your drinking has brought you to this point.  We got Bam in studio.  Hello, Bam.  Yeah, Bam, go right to this mic.  It might work now.  Share a mic with her.  Is it working?  Okay, yeah, it does work.  Bam, one of our pests, one of our really good pests.  We got the O&A pest thing happening.  You got Lady Di this morning.  Yeah, it was absolutely horrendous going up on those train tracks, picking her up. 
[00:50:30]  Now, how did you find her?  Well, I found her when we did the crib segment.  Right.  I know that area.  Yeah, we did a homeless crib with Lady Di.  It's on one of those websites out there that we can't promote yet.  It's on one of those websites, yep.  I found it on whackbag.com.  You're an ass.  Oh, my God.  Are you an idiot?  You are an ass.  You are an utter idiot.  Do you think we don't know the websites?  And that's why we didn't say it.  We just said it's on one of the websites we can't promote. 
[00:51:00]  Or that perhaps we didn't say it.  So then she turns around and promotes it.  Because we're working on things to get it.  But then you, just not knowing anything, blurred it out.  Why are you so stupid?  Why have you gotten to this point?  You're stupid.  Hey, I don't know.  Would you check into a detox today if someone would take you there?  Yes, I would.  Don't act like you have things to do.  You would go today.  If there's a detox in New York that would take you, you would go into this.  Oh, there is?  I said, if there was.  I'm sure there is.  Of course there is.  If there was, would you leave right from the studio and go right there? 
[00:51:30]  Don't act like you don't have things to tie up.  Why don't you know?  Because I have to go back to Westfield.  I have to go to the SCI program.  Marion's on the line.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di's best friend from childhood.  Even Marion gave up on Lady Di.  They've been friends for her.  Don't put the headphones on her!  I'm not that dirty.  Yes, you are.  I don't want lice.  I smelled it in my car on the way in.  It was horrific.  I don't want lice.  Lady Di, you're now emanating a homeless woman smell. 
[00:52:00]  Congratulations.  Congrats.  No.  Yes, you are.  Yes.  Congrats.  Maybe we can have some kind of headphones that are used just for this purpose that will  be alcoholed.  E-Rock will just hold the headphones up so Lady Di can hear Marion.  Yeah, turn it up loud so she can hear Marion.  Marion, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Hey, we got Lady Di in the studio.  She looks awful.  How did you get her there?  Bam picked her up at the train station.  How'd she get here?  How you doing, Marion?  Oh, nice to talk to you. 
[00:52:30]  What did you do to me fighting when I tried to talk to you, Diana?  Uh-oh.  I didn't do anything.  You still got your black eye?  No.  What happened?  Oh, what happened, Marion?  No idea what happened.  Ask her.  What happened?  It's from the sun.  That's what happened with that.  The sun punched you in the face?  No.  The sun has a hell of a right hook.  No.  I'm sure your own would like to.  Oh.  Diana?  Yes.  Is Paul with you?  No.  Who's Paul?  The guy that's been dumping him on a train station.  Yeah, Paul is this great influence. 
[00:53:00]  No, no, no.  Don't bring anybody else into this.  So Paul has been a great influence.  Wait, what does Paul do?  He dumps a lot of train tracks when he doesn't want to hang with us.  Marion, stop it.  That's not true.  Come on.  And he's having sex with her.  I don't know about that.  We know that.  We saw the video clip.  No, no, no, no.  Tuesday night, me and another friend.  He was not on the video at all.  Diana?  Diana?  I'm right here.  Listen to me.  What are you doing here?  You know what?  You got a lot of nerve going there. 
[00:53:30]  What do you think they're going to do?  They're not going to help you.  You don't listen to nobody.  You don't listen.  Me and Allison tried to talk to you last Tuesday.  What did you do?  You stare at us like you're into fucking space.  Hey, hey.  Watch the language, Marion.  Marion.  I like it, though.  Marion's giving her a little...  I need to help you so many times.  Allison's trying to help you.  What do you do?  You're like, okay, I don't need rehab.  I don't need this.  I don't need...  You do too need help.  You need rehab.  You told me this a thousand times already. 
[00:54:00]  Okay, I got you.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  I don't want to see you dead.  I don't want to see you get bit by all of these animals that live in the wild.  But why are you...  Why are you bringing up your ex?  You were just telling me about the raccoons that used to run over you while you're sleeping.  Marion, they don't bother me now.  They don't bother me.  They don't bother you.  They don't bother you.  How does that make you feel that they root through garbage and ignore you?  They had a fire up there the other day.  They had a fire up there, huh?  Yeah.  Where she's staying at, they had a fire on Sunday. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  That must have been entertaining.  It's like TV for you guys.  I didn't see that.  I wasn't there for that.  Where were you?  I was staying over at a friend's house.  I was talking to the Star Ledger guy yesterday, and he told me that they had a brush fire up there where you're staying at.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're really looking like Throw Mama from a train.  I mean, Diana...  That's exactly...  I mean, it's not even fun.  And it's the same age and everything.  How old are you?  She's 44.  Oh, my God.  You look a lot older than that.  Tell him that.  How does she look to you guys?  She looks awful.  She's off sunburned, isn't she? 
[00:55:00]  She's staying at sunburned, but there's also...  It's also the alcohol completely taking over her body.  Now, when I seen her Tuesday, she had...  Her face was all red, but when I seen her Friday night to try to talk to her again, she had a black eye.  Does she still have a black eye?  It's swollen.  I don't have a black eye.  It's swollen.  It's from the sun.  You had a black eye.  It's swollen.  You can see it.  You can see it.  Now, how did you get the black eye?  No one punched you or anything like that.  How did you get it? 
[00:55:30]  Stop lying.  You fell into a train.  Well, how did you get it?  No, I did not.  How did you get the black eye?  How did you get it?  I fell down.  I fell into a red, and it wasn't makeup, because you don't wear makeup no more.  Now, you lied and said you didn't have a black eye right up until you just said you fell and got a black eye.  Stop lying.  It's still a lie.  You got punched in the face.  What was it?  A man punched you for some reason.  No one punched me.  You're lying.  You're a compulsive liar.  What happened?  You were sleeping with somebody, and he sobered up?  Diana.  No.  No. 
[00:56:00]  Diana.  Yeah.  You know, what'd you do?  Take a train over to New York and walk them to the studio?  No.  Bam picked her up.  Bam picked her up.  What?  And Elizabeth?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a good egg.  And that's the first day I don't have my Wi-Fi with me at work.  It's so bad I can't hear the show.  How about putting on the radio?  We're on 92.3 here in New York.  I know, man.  Remember I called you guys there?  Take a picture.  All right.  Shut up.  We don't care.  Oh, my God.  Now we remember why these two used to hang out.  Exactly.  The mousetraps are here.  Start setting them up. 
[00:56:30]  Thank God.  We lost Jim.  Jim was going to take you to detox right now.  Put him in rehab.  I'm trying to get her to go back for health.  There's Frank and Yonkers, though, that says the same thing.  He works for detox.  They would take her.  I mean, I think of up.  All right.  Shut up, Marion.  Shut up.  Frank and Yonkers, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  All she has to do is be brought up to Yonkers.  Marion.  Marion.  Hold on, Frank.  Marion.  Shut up.  Shut up for a minute.  Marion.  Hold on.  Are you listening to me?  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:57:00]  We're talking to Frank.  I forgot that these two don't know when to shut up.  Marion never knows when to shut up.  Marion, we are talking to a gentleman named Frank from a detox center.  Could you shut your mouth for a second?  I'm sorry.  I was talking on my phone.  No, that means just shut up.  I don't care.  Now, shut up.  All right, Frank.  Hello, guys.  Yes.  If she can be brought up to Yonkers, I'll give you the address off the air.  They would admit her.  They'd do a rapid detox.  They'd clean her up. 
[00:57:30]  But the thing is, she's going to want to have to stay there because, unfortunately, the stupid  laws in New York, once they're checked in, they're under their own power.  Yeah, of course.  They can leave if she wants to.  Now, she could do this right from this studio.  She can be driven over there, dropped off, and they would take her.  I will even drive her.  Of course.  Of course.  Shut up, Marion.  Marion, we're told you.  Marriott!  Shut up!  Holy Jesus!  Shut up!  Shut up for a second!  Frank. 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Can he shoot me?  Thank you.  Someone just shoot me.  Frank.  Yes?  They would take her?  I can almost guarantee it.  Put me off there, and I'll give you the name and number, who to speak to, and I'll make  sure that someone sees her.  But here's the problem.  Here's the problem. 
[00:58:30]  Lady Di, if we can get you right from this studio to a detox center, nonstop, no stops,  I'm talking right out this front door to a detox center, would you go?  Why are you hesitating?  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  What are you afraid of?  I'm scared.  Because it's the...  Scared of what?  It's the first step of getting your life back in order.  What are you scared of?  What are you scared of?  You sleep and get raped and punched by homeless guys.  No, I'm scared.  You have raccoons.  Crawling over you.  No, I don't.  You should be scared of death at this point. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Because that's where you're heading, fast.  You are at the bottom of the barrel.  There's nothing left to be scared of.  Do you understand?  You're done.  Look at you.  You are a Bowery bum.  You're a bum, Jules.  You're a bum.  Someone's saying that you look like Babe Ruth if he was homeless.  You know, baseball was wonderful to me.  The last, like, speech he gave when his throat was pouring out.  Do you remember that?  Yeah, you remember that.  I remember that.  Of course you do.  You were drunk when it happened. 
[00:59:30]  I saw films of it.  Oh, wow.  That's wonderful.  Why don't you go to a detox?  Why wouldn't you do that right now?  Westfield stinks even when you're â€“ you don't have to stop in a Westfield.  There's nowhere to stop.  You have no loose ends.  That's where my welfare person is.  So what?  She has to readmit me.  She'll be fine.  Readmit you.  You go to a detox, and they will get in touch with your welfare person.  They get in touch with people.  They told me to go through her.  They told me to go through her.  If you walk into a detox today, nothing bad is going to happen.  Right.  I told you to â€“  You're not going to lose welfare money. 
[01:00:00]  You're not going to get billed for anything.  You're not going to â€“ you'll get help.  And all you need right now, the only thing you need is help because you're a wreck.  Anthony.  Yes, Marion.  I told Diana last Friday night to go back into the hospital.  We got two hospitals here in New Orleans.  She can walk back â€“ she can walk into either one of them.  All right, hold on.  We got Jim in Brooklyn.  No, no, no.  They let me go from that hospital.  Diana, and I told you to go back because I told you I called somebody.  Let's say hi â€“ 
[01:00:30]  I told you to come back.  All right, let's say hi to Jim.  Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Jim tried to help out Lady Di in the past, and it went nowhere.  He tried to â€“ he called me, too.  Yeah, Jim from Brooklyn.  Good morning.  Hey, Jim.  Good morning, Jim.  I don't know if you â€“ Diana, I'm hoping you can hear me.  I'm going to ask you a very simple question, and you're going to decide whether I'm ever  going to bother with you again.  Are you an alcoholic?  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  I admit it.  Oh, wow.  Oh, cool.  I admit it.  I am.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:01:00]  That's fucking tight.  Hey, hey, watch the language.  That F word is really rearing its ugly head today.  Yeah, just watch the language.  A lot of F words today, yes.  You guys know I've been on with you on a free show before.  That's the first time I've got â€“  Let's just keep them under control.  But we see your point, sir.  Yeah, she finally admits it, that she's an alcoholic.  I've been admitting it.  Haven't we told you in the past â€“  I think it's a bad time.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Haven't we told you in the past that the road you're on, and this was when you still had 
[01:01:30]  a house and a job, that the road you were on is going to lead you right here to where  you are now, homeless.  We said you're going to lose your home.  You're going to lose your kid.  I told you the same thing, Anthony.  And what did you do?  No, no.  That's not going to â€“ oh, no, no.  Oh, that's not going to happen.  And now look where you are.  Yeah, I know.  So why don't you listen?  I told you the same thing, didn't I?  So what are we doing?  I told you the same thing.  What are we doing?  Because this is the last â€“  I've been doing the same thing for how many years?  What are we doing?  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Marion.  Marion, hold on. 
[01:02:00]  So why don't you go to a detox?  You have no loose ends to tie up.  You have nothing to do in Westfield.  And you have somebody in the studio that will take you right now.  You can go right now.  Drive you over there.  Right now.  He'll drive you right there.  I went to rehab.  Instant help.  I went when I was 18 to a rehab.  Why don't you just go?  I went.  Ben, are you going to drive her?  I'll drive her.  Absolutely.  See?  You got transportation, and you got a place.  There's nothing you have to go back to in Elizabeth.  You have a broken mattress on abandoned train tracks, and you woke up this morning asking 
[01:02:30]  for the first thing you asked for from me was, I need beer and cigarettes.  Oh, really?  That was the first thing she asked for.  That's the truth.  Beer and cigarettes.  You get the shakes.  You know?  You get the shakes.  That's what happens.  Do you really â€“ this is your life.  Did you get her a beer?  Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,  shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake,  why don't you go to a rehab today?  At least go to detox.  You want to have a little rehab going to party?  We'll get you some beers.  Anthony?  Yeah.  Who's up there with her? 
[01:03:00]  Who's up there?  You know, we're not going to explain who's here.  All right.  There's a lot of people.  Listen, we've got to move on because â€“  She came by herself.  Yeah, she came by herself and â€“  Patty's up here too, Marion.  Huh?  Patty's up here.  Don't touch anything.  Patty actually was homeless for a short time and she was able to slap her pathetic life together.  What about you, Ken?  And look, at least she's clean.  And Club Soda Kenny's up here too.  Is he on up there with you?  Oh, Patty's got something to say, Marion.  So â€“  You go to the rehabilitation center.  You've got to follow their rules and do everything they say. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, you can't just walk in.  They have zero tolerance for drugs, alcohol, everything.  Way to sell it.  Shut your face.  I've already been through this.  The rehabilitation.  Look at Patty giving tough love.  No kidding.  I'm sorry.  You've got to cooperate and you don't.  She doesn't.  You're right.  She's angry.  All right, listen.  What are we going to do?  Because we've spent enough time on this mess.  Yeah.  Well â€“  She said she would go.  She did say she would go.  You'd go.  Jim, where can we bring her right now?  Diana. 
[01:04:00]  Hold on, Marion.  Marry in Brooklyn.  Didn't that guy give you the place up in Yonkers?  Well, Frank â€“  Okay, he's still on the line.  Yeah, put Frank on hold and have Travis get the number of the detox center.  Give them a call and see if they take people.  All right.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Can I talk to her for a minute?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You are on.  Diane.  The problem is with the welfare.  I have to go see this.  You don't have to go see.  She's lying.  You're a liar.  I'm not lying. 
[01:04:30]  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  Yes, you are.  Thank you.  Stop it already.  Diana.  Everyone's on to you.  You're not fooling anybody.  Because the SDI person told me I have to go back to welfare.  You'll get your welfare.  No one's going to take your welfare because you went to detox.  Shut up.  Do you think anybody is believing the fact that somebody is telling you not to go to detox right now as soon as possible?  There's a professional out there that is supposed to be taking care of you.  They're saying, no, don't go to detox.  Diane.  That's your top priority.  Diane, what did we talk about last Tuesday? 
[01:05:00]  I know.  I know what we talked about.  What was it?  Getting raped by homeless people?  No.  What did we talk about Friday when I saw you?  We talked about me going to detox.  Well, go back.  Don't be afraid.  Go back.  A sale at Penny's?  All right.  What did I talk to you about?  Mary, you tell me this a thousand times already.  Okay, I got you.  You don't listen.  A thousand times already and you haven't done it.  That's why she keeps telling you a thousand times.  But Allison's even getting a lot.  Here's the old expression.  If they're ready, you can't say anything wrong. 
[01:05:30]  If they're not ready, you can't say anything right.  Done.  Why don't you just go?  Go.  Shut your mouth.  Just go.  Stop lying and go.  You've disgraced everyone.  Now here's what will happen.  Friend, your son, just go.  Now she's agreeing to go.  The second Bam gets her in the car, she's going to go.  No, I got to go here.  And Bam, call us immediately because that's what will happen.  I will not drive her anywhere other than that place.  If she says yes.  There you go.  She's going to tuck and roll and fly out of your car and look better for her.  She will not be able to get out and we will go to the rehab. 
[01:06:00]  All right.  We got to take a break.  Marion, thanks, I guess.  Hey, guys.  Good luck.  I tried to.  All right.  We know you did.  Talk to you later, Marion.  Thanks.  Try to contact me if you can tomorrow or tonight.  Okay.  All right.  I just wanted to slap our life back together so we can screw it up again.  It's so funny to watch the long, hard slide down.  Please don't do that.  Yeah.  Like, you're going to help yourself.  Shut up.  This isn't a telephone.  We're doing a radio show. 
[01:06:30]  If you have anything else to tell her, call her.  How come we never hang up on Marion?  Yes, we'll keep you posted.  I'll call you next week.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we can't wait.  Okay?  All right.  Yeah.  Bye.  You're a godsend.  I'm hearing the mousetraps being set back there, and a couple of them are going off,  and I just heard, oh.  Wow.  Someone just nailed their hand in there.  Yeah.  Well, how much money do you need, Lady Di?  Yeah.  How much do you have on you right now?  I have a dollar.  You want a few bucks?  You have a dollar.  You want a few bucks before you go to detox? 
[01:07:00]  Give it to Kenny so he can throw it as he's going to.  We can't give it to her today.  Can't give it to her today.  This is money that if she earns it today, she will get it in a few days.  No way you give her money today.  Detox.  Yeah, you don't get it today.  Absolutely not.  Or it's going right to booze.  No, absolutely not today.  But whatever she earns today, we're not going to lie.  We're not going to steal from you.  Where'd you get the buck?  I had it for a while.  For a while.  That's how you know you're in trouble.  The welfare person gave it to me.  A what?  The welfare person gave me $20.  Oh, that was nice of that.  We're not giving you any money today, but if you do something like this, you'll get money  when you get out of detox. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  And you'll have money actually when you come out.  They'll have money waiting for you when you get out.  There you go.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll get at least, I don't know, 12 bucks together.  Can I get money for Lysol for my car?  Yeah, no problem.  So you guys, are you going to head out and try to get her to rehab or whatever?  I think we got some addresses.  Yeah, Travis got some addresses.  Call up the show and we'll see how you do, the progress you make, okay?  Absolutely.  I think she'll go.  I think she'll go.  All right, Lady Di, later.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.  All right.  There it is.  Bye, Di. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  Good luck.  Bam, keep us posted.  I shall.  On what goes on.  Let us know.  You got a cell phone, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let us know when you get to the detox place, when she gets dropped off, if she actually  goes in.  You don't understand how big of a liar she is.  Oh, yeah, we do.  I got in the car this morning.  She told me that everything she said on the crib segment about screwing other, I don't  know if I can say that, but with other people on the railroad tracks over the railroad, all  that stuff panhandling, it wasn't true. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, it wasn't true.  It's not true.  I lied when I was on the videotape.  That's what she's saying?  Yeah.  She is a compulsive liar.  All right, well.  And a silly goose.  All right, we'll check in with Bam and Lady Di in the car after the break, I guess.  Wish me luck.  And we also got mousetraps all over the studio.  Stalker Patty, what do you think?  Oh.  You're the queen of the mousetraps.  What do you think?  You got to, like, try this out for us so we can do this tomorrow for the tool tickets.  All right?  And we even have Dr. Ian Smith here in case there's an injury of some sort. 
[01:09:00]  That's right.  He can tell you what to eat as you're injured.  How did Lady Di look to you?  Do I have a mic?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Look at her face.  It's not sunburned.  Are you kidding?  Malnutrition.  Yeah.  She's freaking drinking all over the place.  She's swollen in her right eye.  Dehydrated.  She's dehydrated.  You can see she's all dehydrated.  She's shaking.  She has, you know, tremors, alcoholic tremors, DTs, yeah. 
[01:09:30]  How much time do you think she has?  She keeps like this?  Yeah.  She can't go more than a month like this.  I mean, look at her.  If she stays like this.  Come on, Bam.  You got to take her right there.  Just take her right there.  Yeah, I will.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got Dr. Ian Smith in studio as well.  Colin Quinn will be joining the program.  Who else is on today?  We got Edward Norton.  Edward Norton.  Billy Connolly.  And Billy Connolly, yes.  Lots of shows still to do.  So, after the break, Stalker Patty tries out the mousetraps for us.  It's the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:10:00]  Opie and Anthony have returned to CBS Radio.  And the listeners couldn't be happier.  You guys are still on the Howard Stern Show, man.  Who are you kidding?  There's about a thousand stations doing the same exact show.  God, that's right, John.  You can do whatever you want.  You're just going to fail because you're stuck because you're just repeating what everybody else does.  And by the way, I was listening to your show in the beginning when you were making fun of I.  I miss you hanging out in the building for this pink cowboy hat and the whole deal.  I like this guy.  By the way, Sirius just offered him a show.  They're paying him $10 million. 
[01:10:30]  El programa de Opie and Anthony.  TambiÃ©n Jim Norton.  No se lo olvide de Jim.  That means don't forget about Jim.  Opie and Anthony.  By the way, our sister station, WFAN, is conducting a radiothon right now, Anthony.  Yes.  To raise money for the Imus Ranch for Kids with Cancer.  The Tomorrow's Children's Fund helps kids with cancer and their families.  And, of course, the CJ Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome as well.  It's going on right now.  We're asking you to make a donation. 
[01:11:00]  There's two ways to do it.  If you'd like to donate online, please head over to your computer and go to WFAN.com, then click on the Radiothon banner, or you can make your donation by phone toll-free at 1-877-877-6464.  That number, once again, 1-877-877-6464.  Please have your Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover Card ready when you make your donations for a great cause.  Imus is doing it right now on MSNBC. 
[01:11:30]  And he had our boss, Joel Hollander, on just now.  Yeah.  A very, very good cause.  So there you go with that.  The mousetraps are set and ready to go, Ant.  Yeah, I see that.  Wow.  There's quite a few of them.  And we got Patty here.  And she's very scared.  Ugh.  Patty's, uh, you should be used to these mousetraps by now.  Tell me about it.  And, um, you get nothing for this. 
[01:12:00]  Of course, you're just testing these out so we know they work tomorrow when we have, uh, real people that we care about, uh, coming in here to try to win tool tickets and cold hard cash.  And other things, I think.  We should get more prizes.  Maybe certificates for CDs.  And we really gotta, you know, make it, uh, worth everyone's while tomorrow.  Uh, but we definitely have tool tickets.  I think we have at least $500 cash.  And we'll throw some other prizes, uh, down on the floor amongst the mousetraps.  Okay?  But we want to make sure this is going to work. 
[01:12:30]  So, uh, you know, we, we take you within the show here.  We like to try out our stuff before we, uh, bring it to the public.  But in this case, we figured we'd try it out live on the air with, uh, Stalker Patty.  Uh, Stalker Patty has done this in the past, by the way.  But it's been like, I don't know, 10 or 12 mousetraps, something like that.  Today, there's got to be close to 100 mousetraps on the floor in the Free FM studio.  What's wrong, Ben?  I just, uh, I'm just disgusted. 
[01:13:00]  Why?  Because Patty's a fucking mousetraps.  Oh.  Ah!  Ah!  Ben.  First off, Ben.  Wow.  That word is flying today.  Ben is a potty mouth.  A little potty mouth, Ben.  She's an effing mess?  No, I'm not.  She's not.  Compared to Lady Di, she's got her act together.  Yeah, well, come on.  Oh, yeah, well.  Compared to Lady Di, Jesus.  Lady Di just asked me for 20 bucks in the hall.  Oh, really?  Could I have $20? 
[01:13:30]  Jim promised me $20.  I'm like, no, he didn't.  Did you promise me $20?  No, when you get out of detox, we'll give you something, you fat liar.  She's such a liar.  She is not going to rehab, by the way.  I absolutely know she will not go there.  That might be the last time we see Lady Di.  Fine by me.  Hey, Stalker Patty, time to get the blindfold on, okay?  Yeah, put that curtain down, I would say.  Put that shade down.  She's going to be in her panties and bra.  No, we don't need her in her panties.  We've decided we don't even need her in her panties.  No, not her. 
[01:14:00]  How about barefoot?  She should walk through barefoot, too.  Yeah, take your shoes off.  That's fair.  Take those awful old lady shoes off.  In case you stand up and decide to run.  She has little blue grandma shoes on.  Yeah.  That's the latest rage, those dumb slipper type shoes.  Are they?  Like a geisha ant.  Those are terrible.  Usually you see them on a hot chick.  Eesh.  Patty's getting, um...  Patty.  Patty, you're getting more weight around your ass and your thighs.  You're looking more like a pear.  Yeah, you're getting, like, pear-shaped. 
[01:14:30]  What's going on with...  This means I've got to work a little harder, because I'm going through changes.  Ugh.  Oh.  Patty, are you going through menopause?  God, we have been off the radio for a long time.  Can you believe this?  She's a virgin.  She's untouched by man.  And she is going through menopause.  You've wasted a perfectly good reproductive system.  Actually, no.  You have a better sex life after it. 
[01:15:00]  But stop it.  Whoever told you that your sex life gets better after menopause?  Who told you that?  She's not going to have to worry about pregnancy or anything like that anymore.  Can you believe this?  This is...  They have something called birth control.  Well...  She's not going to have to worry about pregnancy when you see the bloomers sticking out the back of it.  Her big bloomers.  Sorry.  Patty...  That's her birth control.  Patty, it doesn't get better after menopause.  That's a farce. 
[01:15:30]  I love watching those commercials for, like, Centrum Silver.  I'm living the best years of my life.  Are you?  Are you in your diaper with your teeth flying out of your head?  Let me tell you something.  Having to use lubricant just to eat?  I mean...  Forget about it.  Your best years, Patty?  Wow!  So far behind you.  Let me tell you something.  People have told me I'm in good shape for my age.  That's great, but you're not using it.  Yeah, you're not using it. 
[01:16:00]  You have wasted your reproductive system.  It's like a business, and it's shutting down.  It's shutting down.  It's starting to close up.  The whole business is closing up, and they haven't sold one piece of merchandise.  They've cut back.  The father's retired.  Put the kid in charge, and he's ruining the business.  It's like some of those old bodegas you go into or an old deli, and there's, like, you know...  There's, like, I don't know, a can of string beans on the shelf and milk that's really old.  A box of cornflakes that expired a year ago.  Ooh, look at this.  Money, money, money for later. 
[01:16:30]  When we do the walk from this studio to the XM Satellite Radio studio later, around 850 right outside this station,  Club Soda Candy will be skipping and throwing money all over New York, so...  Patty, yeah, you've wasted your reproductive system.  You should have used it when it was still good, and now what it's doing is drying up.  It's withering on the vine.  You're going through menopause, and you've never had sex.  Doesn't that make you feel bad? 
[01:17:00]  No, actually, you know, I don't have to worry about HIV.  I don't have to worry about diseases.  I don't have to worry about a bunch of shit that I can't handle.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm sorry.  I am amazed at the amount of cursing that is going on today.  What is wrong with you people?  The only one not cursing is me.  And Stalker Patty hasn't said one bad word today.  And you.  And I don't think Stalker Patty has ever cursed on our show.  No, ever.  In all these years we've had her on.  All the times on Satellite she could have cursed, and she never did. 
[01:17:30]  And now here on our regular FM.  I go out of my way to take care of myself.  What a waste.  Her lady parts are going, oh, well.  Oh, just.  After years and years of her lady parts waiting for action, now it's just.  What was once juicy grapes are now dried up raisins in a cardboard box.  They're getting everything into boxes and getting ready to move to Florida.  You've never known the joy of coughing and spitting out a window and yelling you were supposed to tell me. 
[01:18:00]  Somehow that's a little bit tense.  So what's going on with the menopause?  Yeah, how's that, having hot flashes?  Well, not too much.  I think I'm going through it.  The doctor isn't sure because my levels of estrogen are way too high for some reason.  Yeah, it's menopause.  Well, we do have a doctor in studio, Dr. Ian Smith.  He's got a fine book out called The Fat Smash Diet.  He's going to give a lot of listeners the book today because he owes us.  But before that.  Yeah.  What can you tell Patty about menopause? 
[01:18:30]  You got the hot flashes?  No, I don't have any of that at all.  Weight gain?  Yeah, a little weight gain.  She's getting dumpy.  I'm 120 up from 114.  You're getting dumpy around the thighs.  Yeah, your butt's starting to squish out.  Yeah, size.  Well, maybe there's special exercises I could do because you are supposed to have a change  in metabolism.  But my diet's very healthy.  It's all vegetables, fish.  You got to get some cardio in your diet. 
[01:19:00]  Baby food.  A lot of people out there get a lot of cardio having sex.  Right.  Yeah.  But that's not going to be part of your routine.  So you might have to get on a treadmill.  And what is your fear of conditioner?  What do you mean fear of conditioner?  You know exactly what he means.  I tried everything on my hair.  It's just my hair.  You got cotton candy hair.  Exactly.  Like uncooked spaghetti.  It's just the way I was born.  Your hair makes us sick.  Oh.  It's all right.  Well, we got to know Stalker Patty.  So it's menopause.  Yeah, a little menopause is why. 
[01:19:30]  There's nothing wrong with you now.  It's natural.  There's nothing wrong with menopause.  What we have a problem with is that you're a 51-year-old virgin.  You've done nothing with what is now drying up.  It's just that I have moral feelings about that.  Moral feelings.  So in all of your life, in all of your fertile years, all of your fertile years, you have  never found one man that was worthy of that?  Not one man was worthy of your flower. 
[01:20:00]  It was lack of opportunity.  I would either just go to work and just go home.  And I never really had much of an interest in going out.  Did you have urges?  I know men and women have urges.  Patty, it's a natural thing.  It's a primal thing that men and women have urges to unite.  And you've never had these?  I mean, I do have urges.  And only in the last 10, 15 years have I accepted them. 
[01:20:30]  Accepted them.  And when are you actually going to put them into play?  Your religious upbringing ruined your life.  Do you know that?  Well, sort of, I guess.  You know, it's going to get to the point where if you do get the opportunity, it's going  to have to be done in a jacuzzi of Vaseline.  Because every second now, you are losing vital things like lubricants.  Things that help along the process.  I don't know. 
[01:21:00]  You've got tumbleweeds in there.  No, I don't.  I take very good care of myself.  You're a mess, Patty.  You are.  Hey, yeah, that's a good idea.  We've got the Hulk music so we can say goodbye to Patty's ovaries.  I don't have it over here, do I?  It's Stuart from one of our fine websites suggesting that we play the Hulk walking away music and  say goodbye to Stalker Patty's ovaries. 
[01:21:30]  Stalker Patty's ovaries.  Stalker Patty's ovaries.  There they go.  In mint condition.  Never been used.  Still have the cellophane on them.  There they go.  Walking into the sunset.  Packing up their suitcases.  You know, when I was in college.  Boarding a Greyhound bus.  Pregnancy.  The headstall.  I've never had that kind of stress in my life.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but what you've sacrificed, stop trying to find the positives in your awful social life. 
[01:22:00]  What you've sacrificed for that safety.  Life isn't always about the safest road, Patty.  Life is sometimes living with a little bit of danger, a little on the edge.  And that is really, you know, no danger to take the proper precautions.  But you've missed out on adventure, fun, feeling good.  Do you know what feels good?  Do you even know that?  No, she doesn't.  She has no clue.  Do you know, Patty, I talked to a guy with age recently.  He said, at least I'm not Patty. 
[01:22:30]  He was talking into the mirror at the time.  Angela from Pennsylvania.  Angela.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Angela.  Angela.  You're killing me.  I'm on my way to work.  I'm only 33.  I've still got it going on.  The sound of her voice is making my lady parts dribble up.  Come on.  Isn't that an awful voice for a woman to have?  Mousetrapper, get her out.  Why don't you?  Thank God she's a virgin, because I couldn't fathom the thought of her talking sexy. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, touch me there.  Oh, that feels so good.  When she said, my estrogen levels are still too high.  High.  I felt my ovary run down my leg and leave the car.  Hey, Patty, what is it called?  It's called practicing something when you keep yourself clean.  Practicing good what?  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  It's good hygiene.  The sound of her voice is worse than David Lee Roth. 
[01:23:30]  Very good.  And it's horrid.  All right, Angela.  See you, guys.  Thank you.  Bye, Angela.  You turn people off with that voice.  Maybe that's chase men away.  All right.  Well, you know what?  Why do we bother with these people?  I don't know.  We're trying to get Lady Di to stop drinking.  We're trying to get Stalker Patty to have some sex.  I want to make that for somebody to care about.  Oh, shut up.  Just admit you're never going to know that intimacy.  Just admit it.  Save it for someone you care about.  You know who's going to get you?  The mortician.  When you're laid out on a slab, completely against your will, 
[01:24:00]  your body will be cold and frigid,  and some sick mortician is going to go, you know, why not?  Why not?  And there you'll be getting violated in your death.  And then him and his friends will practice jiu-jitsu on your body  and send you to heaven as a sinner and a whore.  How great would that be if she went to hell because of what happened  after she died?  Afterward.  Oh, would that be perfect?  I didn't do anything, Satan. 
[01:24:30]  I was good in my whole life.  I didn't touch a man or nothing.  Yeah, but look, let me show you the videotape of what happened up there on the slab.  You see now when, no, the third gentleman, yeah, the black guy,  when he comes in.  Why are they turning me on my face?  Why are they?  I didn't think the emploming procedure entailed flipping me over.  Hey, Colin Quinn, everybody.  Hey, Colin.  Colin's good friends with Patty.  Colin actually had Patty do a couple of sketches on Tough Crowd. 
[01:25:00]  Did you want to do the thing yet?  No, we were waiting for you.  Yeah.  That was the worst intervention anyone's ever done.  Oh, when Lady Di?  Get on, Mike.  You heard the Lady Di intervention?  Wasn't that horrible?  That was awful.  Patty had the most sensible advice of anybody.  Yeah, get on, Mike, there, Colin.  You've done a little radio in your time.  There you go.  Isn't it?  Wasn't it just awful advice?  We were just abusing her.  It was so awful.  And I don't like Norton's Dutch uncle tough love attitude.  I really wanted this.  Patty's the only one that said you got to follow the rules when you go in there, right?  She called it rehabilitation, though. 
[01:25:30]  Nobody called it rehabilitation.  We were on stroke of changes.  Rehab.  I was catching the Metropolitans game last night.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Dr. Ian Smith in studio.  Stalker Patty, after the break, is going to try out our mousetrap thing because we're  going to do this tomorrow for tool tickets and cold hard cash and hopefully a lot of other  prizes.  Okay?  The whole studio is going to have mousetraps tomorrow and Patty's going to try it out to  see you.  By the way, the best thing was how aggravated Opie was getting during the intervention. 
[01:26:00]  He wanted to get back to business.  He was like, okay, we've spent enough time.  All right.  Enough with this woman.  Oh, she's horrid.  He really wanted to smash everybody in the face.  There was a time in my life I'd try to help people and then you'd try to help people.  You wanted to beat up Anthony and Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Absolutely ruining your radio show.  No, but people out there can relate.  There are people in your lives and you try to help them over.  And over and over again.  And it's like, well, you might as well talk to the wall.  I don't have time for those people anymore. 
[01:26:30]  It smells better, too.  You know what bothers me?  Lady Di, I swear to God, she looks like you in a wig.  Now that is uncalled for, Jimmy.  That's ugly.  That's an insult to both of us.  All right.  Here we go.  I think Bam's got Lady Di in a car.  We're going to check in with them before the end of the show.  So why don't we take a break?  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  When we get back, Stalker Patty will be blindfolded and she's going to be crawling around amongst  the mousetraps is at least 100 on the floor.  And she's going to be searching for fake prizes today.  She doesn't get anything out of this. 
[01:27:00]  She gets nothing.  She gets nothing.  How is this like the rest of your life, right?  Searching mousetraps for fake prizes.  Baby.  Great.  All right.  We'll continue.  Opie and Anthony show.  Most of us get here on time.  We're just fat guys on the air.  We are so pathetic.  We're fancy, fancy people.  It's a battle of the mental illness.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children. 
[01:27:30]  It's showtime, folks.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You'll love us.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  You're checking out the O&A virus spreading across America slowly but surely.  We need your help.  If you like what you're hearing, tell a friend, please.  This is how this thing's going to work in the end because we're starting from, I don't  know, no listeners.  Zero.  As far as like terrestrial radio goes, we're on in like nine cities, something like that. 
[01:28:00]  Seven cities, I don't know.  We did that at NEW.  We had the big purge when we first came on.  And then slowly built up a nice audience.  There you go.  Colin Quinn in studio.  Yeah.  Good to have Colin in.  Thanks, guys.  It's good to be here.  Yes.  The place is a mess, though, huh?  Oh, the place is a med house.  It's a wreck.  There's no walls.  There's no ceiling.  No.  They're going to be taken care of.  The base is too low.  Just kidding, guys.  Get to the mousetrap before somebody else comes in for an intervention. 
[01:28:30]  We missed this one.  You're sitting on like a first grader's chair.  Could you raise that up?  I can't believe it.  He's like two feet lower than everybody in the room.  It's better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With Patty's ass height.  Patty is right there.  Her butt's looking pretty good.  That extra weight went to all the right places.  Oh, jeez.  I'm serious.  All right.  Let's blindfold her.  Doesn't she look like she's wearing Dudley Do-Right's pants?  Like, it's all at the hips.  It's like state trooper pants.  She's got the saddle bags going. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know.  I like this outfit, actually.  Those awful old lady bunion shoes.  Those shoes are horrendous.  Yeah.  Well, that's true.  The shoes could use a little work with him.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to get right into this because we got Edward Norton calling in in a few minutes  here.  New movie, Down in the Valley.  Make him do his American History X speech that he did to Elliot Gould.  Oh, that would rock.  Oh, is that brutal?  Make him do it.  Club Soda Kenny is blindfolding Stalker Patty.  By the way, good news.  We need more contestants for tomorrow. 
[01:29:30]  Uh-huh.  See, Stalker Patty, if you're just tuning in, we got about 100 mousetraps courtesy of  PestControlWorld.biz.  B-I-Z.  The .biz.  I think that's the first person I ever heard that had a .biz.  PestControlWorld.biz.  Here it is.  He gave me the electric mousetraps that work so, so well.  It's unbelievable.  I've killed, I don't know, getting close to 20 kills in my apartment, by the way.  Oh, nice.  Patty, don't worry.  It's Dr. Ian Smith.  Oh, my God.  Colin. 
[01:30:00]  Patty's blindfolded and Colin's taking some liberties with her front.  Wow, Colin.  Yeah.  Well, she can't testify if she can't see.  You know.  Who touched you?  I don't know.  All I did was feel a handle.  That's good.  Let's bring in the lacrosse team.  Come on, Patty.  Be a trooper.  All right.  Here's the deal.  So Patty's going to try out the mousetraps for us.  There's over 100 mousetraps, and there's fake prizes on the floor. 
[01:30:30]  Patty gets absolutely nothing for this.  She's just trying it out for us.  Patty, can you see?  No.  Steve, punch her in the face.  See if she can see it.  Tomorrow, we're going to do the same exact thing for real prizes, tool tickets, cold, hard cash, and hopefully other prizes we can find here at Free FM, okay?  So, Patty, you're blindfolded.  How do you feel?  Scared.  She's scared again.  All right.  Get on all fours.  All fours?  And you've got to take your shoes off, because at one point, you have to walk through there.  Yeah, yeah.  Take off those horrible shoes.  Get those horrid Asian shoes off. 
[01:31:00]  Those are the ones, like, at last minute when you're Christmas shopping.  Yeah, Grandma.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll get these.  Yeah, strawberry, yeah.  Strawberry colored.  Horrible.  All right.  Yeah, lead her over.  Perish the thought.  She falls and cracks her head.  Look how slow she's walking.  Oh, and we fixed our hammer toes, and I don't know what they did.  They turned them into, like, crescent wrench toes, because they're just as bad.  They just look a little different. 
[01:31:30]  And her big toenails are lethal.  They are more of a danger than the mousetraps.  Patty, do you ever clip your toenails?  I do, but it bothers me when I clip them.  Ew.  It bothers us when you don't.  Look at them.  Well, you're blindfolded.  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you've seen them, though.  Yeah.  She can see from where.  Can she see by looking down?  No.  They are disgusting.  And why is one kind of red? 
[01:32:00]  Are you getting infected?  No, I have nail polish on it.  Nail polish?  It's just going through menopause.  Yeah.  You have to feel like a hawk.  She says she's got talons.  Talons, yeah.  Talons.  All right, come on.  We've got to move this along.  Get on all fours, Patty.  Headfield, put her on all fours, Headfield.  Get on all fours.  Oh.  Steve looks like he's getting ready to fight Chuck Liddell next week.  All right.  This is what we want Patty to do, by the way.  Wait, can I talk?  Hold on.  I've got to talk to the boys.  Oh.  Come here. 
[01:32:30]  All right, cool.  Here comes Stan.  Oh, no.  This game is...  I hope it's not being tampered with.  Isn't it tough enough?  No.  No, I think...  She has to walk barefoot at one point, too, though.  It's appropriate to put, like, electroshocks on it.  This is getting psychotic.  That would be great if we could just taser her.  Well, they actually do have that couple of...  All right.  No, we're not going to taser you.  They do have the electric mousetrap in there.  Patty, here's the deal, because we don't want you cheating.  We want you to hit the back wall and come back.  Yeah, that's what you've got to do.  All right?  You've got to...  Okay, come in tomorrow when the hot girls are doing it naked.  Not that you're not hot, Patty, but...  Yeah, the hot girls will be doing it tomorrow for Tool tickets. 
[01:33:00]  Guys, if you want to go to Tool, you've got to get your wife or girlfriend to come in here tomorrow  and do the same thing in bra and panties or nude.  We're going to figure that out.  Tool time tickets with Tim Allen later on today.  Oh, cut it out.  Oh, I wish that show was still on.  If you want to be a contestant, call us right now, 866-313-FREE.  There you go.  Patty, you've got to hit the back wall.  This looks like an Al Zarcawi video, doesn't it?  Yes.  Her head is wrapped up in a T-shirt.  She's on all fours.  Hello.  Got a Lebanese guy next to her. 
[01:33:30]  That's close enough.  Oh, my God.  The American imperialist.  All right.  Please, I'm being held hostage.  That you've got to let the criminals go from Guantanamo Bay.  Whatever they tell you to do, you have to listen to them.  Listen, my life is at stake here.  They're going to cut my head off.  She chisels out of the place with her toenails.  Escapes in a daring daylight escape.  Patty.  Somebody should do a comic book of Patty.  Yeah, right?  A giant tail toenail.  Patty, you nervous? 
[01:34:00]  She goes over to Iraq.  What?  Are you nervous?  Yeah.  I don't want to get hurt.  Well, who does?  No, blame her.  All right.  You've got to go to the back wall and back.  Here we go.  Look at glue traps.  To the back wall and back.  Now, go slow.  Don't rush because you're going to have to.  Hey, hey, what?  Patty, hold on.  Hold on.  Patty.  Hey, wait, wait, Patty.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm seeing a couple of problems.  First of all, watch your potty mouth because in the position you're in, you're on your hands  and knees right now.  I'll come over there and teach you a lesson.  The second thing, Patty, is no rubbing your hands on the floor. 
[01:34:30]  You must pick your hand up and put it down.  That's right.  Pick your hand up and put it down because you're swatting the mousetraps out of the way and  that's cheating.  And here are, and listen.  The rules made for a reason.  And listen to our voices because we'll direct you to the wall, okay?  Up, Patty.  Up your hand.  Up and down.  You're not going to get the money if you cheat.  Up and down.  Right.  I like the fact that it's like fake cheating.  Up.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That was a good one. 
[01:35:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  This is not there on her legs.  This is worse than what they've done at Alba Grabe.  It was a moment.  It was a moment.  Ah!  Patty, lift your hand up.  This is worse than Alba Grabe.  This is great.  Ah!  Look.  All right.  Someone give a thumbs up while smoking a cigarette.  Ah!  Ah!  Give her the old Lindy England.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:35:30]  She sounds like a chimp.  Right on her hand.  Yeah, let's listen in.  Hey, to your right, Patty, to your right.  To your right, to your right, to your right.  Patty, you got to go right.  She sounds like Mr. Chips.  My leg!  Yeah, you're still there.  No, that's just psychosomatic.  Yes, it was!  Menopause.  Oh, she put her hand right in that one.  You're almost at the wall.  You're almost at the wall.  A little more to the right. 
[01:36:00]  A little more right, or you're going to hit that electrical thing.  That could be fun, but...  Oh, you've got to give at least five dollars for this.  Is it coming to nothing?  Eh, too fitty.  There's actually a prize at the end of it.  Is there?  Yeah.  Okay.  You're cleansing and redemption of the soul.  All right, turn around now.  Turn around.  Keep your hands up and down.  Up and down, Patty.  We don't want you rubbing your hands on the floor.  Am I in the right direction?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now slowly, yeah, circumnavigate your way through the mousetraps. 
[01:36:30]  Lift your hands.  Lift.  Oh, God!  Oh, no, no, that's not...  That's not what?  You put your hand in a mousetrap.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, she's on her way back from the wall.  Last time it was cool for two days.  Hand up and down, Patty.  This would be like a good psychology of evil thing, you know, like when they do those  college student experiments with someone who plays prison cards.  This is truly pure evil.  I'll tell you the truth.  I'll clean it.  It's pretty good.  I was just thinking of that.  All right, let's listen.  That looks nice. 
[01:37:00]  Let's listen in.  Let's listen in.  Wow, no.  She's hit a cluster.  Patty, to your left.  To your left.  Yeah, go a little left, Patty.  To your left.  Why would you listen?  If they tell you to your left, you go right.  She's cheating.  Patty's cheating.  You're cheating.  Oh, my God.  My...  It was under me.  It was under me.  It was under me.  Oh, God.  It was under me.  She's certainly not talking about a man. 
[01:37:30]  She's almost out of the...  She's almost out of the woods.  It was under me.  She's almost out of the minefield.  Patty, you're heading toward the window.  Yeah, you got it.  The only guy's turning around to the right.  No, no.  No.  You're almost out.  You're almost out.  Hands up.  Hand up and down.  Up and down.  No.  No crying.  There's no crying in radio.  No crying.  There's no crying in blindfolded, mouth-crap-walking. 
[01:38:00]  Just crawl, whore.  Jim's going to push himself to this later on.  All right.  You're almost out, Patty.  You know, this is not right.  By the way...  I don't want anything bad to you.  ...for the listeners at home...  Not right.  It was never right.  ...she has been out of the minefield for about 30 seconds.  They just keep taking the mouth-crap from behind her and placing them in front of her.  You're almost out of the... 
[01:38:30]  You're almost out, Patty.  You're almost out of the minefield.  I don't want her to have to walk.  I'll tell you.  There are five guys putting the back in front of her.  You're almost out.  You're so close.  You're really close, Patty.  You only got a couple left in front of you.  Get her to the right a little bit.  She's going the wrong way.  Oh, I'd like to know who invented this game.  Who thought it up?  No, you got to put your hands down, not fists, Patty.  Anyone can do that.  Who thought it up?  I'm sorry.  I invented this game.  Did you really?  It was my invention.  I'm being ripped off once again.  I'm sorry. 
[01:39:00]  You got to use your hands, not your fists.  I invent everything.  There she has made it.  Oh, you're out, Patty.  Dr. Patty made it through the minefield of mouth-crap.  Patty, the courage and bravery.  You got to get her to walk.  Unbelievable.  Oh, my gosh.  She looks like she just went through a traumatic experience.  You're crying, Patty.  You shouldn't be crying.  Are you crying?  Put your shoes on.  Did you put that in my shoes?  Oh, the last little fun treat. 
[01:39:30]  We put mousetraps in our shoes.  I can't see.  I can't see.  My eyes are going crazy.  You okay, Patty?  I see there's tears coming down from your eyes.  You did a bang-up job.  You walked through that.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  Why are you crying?  Does it hurt?  Come here, darling.  Yeah, let Colin comfort you.  Colin always makes Patty feel better.  There you go.  I love Patty.  Patty, would Colin be the right kind of guy? 
[01:40:00]  Because I think he's got a good sense of humor.  He's not like a boy toy.  You don't like the young guy.  I'm not saying you're an old guy.  I'm just saying, you know.  My name is Cher.  Oh, your name is Cher.  She looks ridiculous.  She does look ridiculous.  Yeah, as you crawl around with mousetraps on your fingers.  On your claws.  Yeah, but at least she's...  Yeah.  You know, my feet hurt a little bit, too.  They were on my toes.  It was all over the place.  Well, I guess we're going to be set for tomorrow.  Yeah, I think that'll work out well.  I think it worked out very well today.  You know, we got to get though instead of that stupid, because she was cheating. 
[01:40:30]  Pungy steaks?  She was not cheating.  No.  She was looking like underneath the shirt.  We got to get those eye patches that you sleep with, because you can't see.  I couldn't see a thing.  No?  No.  I had no idea where I was going.  Because he has no integrity.  He's projecting it onto you, Patty.  No, I saw that you were putting your hand...  Because he would have cheated.  I can't see through that shirt.  No?  No.  No.  She didn't see through that shirt.  I couldn't see.  Why do you have to get those eye patches?  Why do you get a rubber ball in their mouth, too, you pervert?  Would Colin make a good companion for you, though? 
[01:41:00]  Like as a man?  To break the ice.  He's got a good sense of humor.  That's always important.  He's a nice guy.  He really is.  Gentle.  Thanks, Patty.  He's very nice.  Colin, I think you got a shot.  And he's a gentleman, too.  Yeah.  All right.  Gentleman.  I like gentlemen.  Yeah.  All right.  We should move on because we got...  Relative to these people.  Uh-oh.  Because I'm a gentleman because I don't put mousetraps and blindfold you.  Within six months, he'd bilk you of what little money you have to go to OTB.  I don't...  Hey, the derby is...  I hate OTB.  So do I, Patty. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, sure.  It's sorted.  Well, that was great.  I'm glad it worked out.  And we know now tomorrow it's going to work.  Yeah.  Do we have enough contestants for tomorrow?  If you want to be in on this contest, give us a call.  1-866-313-FREE.  We will definitely have $500 on the floor tomorrow.  Tool tickets and other prizes from Free FM here in New York City, okay?  Right.  Just give Travis a call right now if you want in on this.  Let Lady Diane tomorrow.  We were going to do it with her today, and then we're like, you know what? 
[01:42:00]  She should be in rehab.  Yeah, believe it or not, she was too pathetic for us.  Are you using these headphones?  No, it's not.  No, those are the Ben ones.  I don't think she was using that.  Yeah, let's say hi to Dennis in New Jersey.  Dennis?  Oh, man.  That's up sick.  Yeah, she was a...  When you guys first started, that used to upset me, but now blindfolded chicks crying,  that's...  I'm shocked.  You're hooked, huh?  I'm excited.  He's hooked.  I'm excited.  Yeah, I think we're going to have fun with this tomorrow.  All right.  Not that we didn't today, Patty.  It's always fun to make you cry. 
[01:42:30]  Why don't we take a quick break?  We've got Edward Norton checking in next.  We break now.  We'll be able to talk to him for a little while, okay?  Okie dokie.  And Colin Quinn in studio, Dr. Ian Smith in studio, the guys picking up the mousetraps.  Once again, I want to thank the guys from pestcontrolworld.biz.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, not again.  Ramone, wash my balls.  Opie and Anthony, weekday mornings.  Colin Quinn in studio.  We've got to get a plug for your Caroline's dates there.  That's right.  And what about my play I produced last night?  What about it?  It's all dolled up at the Acorn Theater.  Pretty funny.  It's got transgender and mafia.  All right.  We'll talk a little bit about that after we talk to Edward Norton.  But Colin Quinn playing Caroline's all this weekend, starting tonight through Sunday. 
[01:43:30]  That's right.  You can get your tickets by calling 212-757-4100.  But right now we're all very excited because we've got Edward Norton on the phone.  Edward Norton.  How are you?  How are you, sir?  I'm very well.  There he is.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Thanks.  Wow.  I got a copy of Down in the Valley.  I saw it last night.  I loved the film.  Oh, thanks.  I want to say that right off the bat.  I absolutely loved it.  I'm a fan of this film.  And this is one of the ones I really like that I've done. 
[01:44:00]  You want to explain the film just a little bit for the people out there?  It's a Western, but it's a contemporary Western.  It takes place out in Los Angeles, San Fernando Valley.  And it's kind of about, you know, kind of like the drifter who walks into town and collides with his family.  But I don't know.  It's hard to sum up.  How would you sum it up?  Um, great sex scene. 
[01:44:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  That's a great plug.  Thanks.  No, I don't want to give too much of it away.  No, I agree.  It's tough.  I mean, it's like, I have to, on the, at some films, like, I mean, how would you sum up Fight Club?  You know what I mean?  It's a very, it's a very hard film to sum up.  It's, it's a lot about, I think the reason that my friend and I who made it did it was, it was, we used to look at each other and say, well, you know, we love, we love the old Westerns.  So why would we want to go make another, another Western the same way everyone else has done it? 
[01:45:00]  Let's, let's do something, let's do it about, like, the West that we live in and let's make a movie that people look at the people in it and they say, oh, you know, I know these people.  I've seen these people around and, and I recognize this experience.  So, uh.  It must be nice to have the opportunity to, uh, be able to put together a movie that you want to do.  So, I mean, I'm sure you went through a few years where it was just, you know, what people want you to do and then you reach a point where you can do your own work.  Yeah, I, I was lucky that way on a, on a certain level. 
[01:45:30]  It's always like that for actors in the beginning, you know, and, and somewhere in there when I started doing movies, I, I, I started picking, I mean, I remember, I remember there was sort of a big John Grisham book, uh, around the time we did American History X.  And I was saying, you should do this, you should do this.  And I thought, you know, uh, really, I shouldn't do that.  I should do, I should do this whole skinhead movie.  But, um, and, and then when you make those, when you do that and, and you realize it means a lot more, more to you, it's, it kind of, it kind of reinforces that. 
[01:46:00]  I got to ask you something about American History X.  So one of my favorite movies, uh, you're in, you're in a couple of my favorite movies, to tell you the truth.  Uh, that movie, there are so many scenes where, and, and I wonder this with other actors, how the hell do you stand there in front of people?  Uh, whether it's, uh, someone of a different race or ethnicity and lambast them like that.  And I know it's part of the character, but how does that end when the shot ends and you make nice, like the dinner scene with Elliot Gould in that is brutal. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, brutal. And you, you come off so authentic as you're, you're just, you know, laying into this guy for being Jewish and his ideology.  What happens after cut? Do you laugh it off? Do you, is there some winding down that you have to do?  Yes. Yeah. You know, the best thing, the best thing is having really great kind of dance partners in it.  And like, when you got somebody like Elliot Gould, the thing is, he's so, he's so good that, that he gets into it with you. 
[01:47:00]  And, and as you, you know, as you switch a shot or you, you change around or you have some seconds in between it all, like he's so good.  He'll even tuck over to you and sort of say, you know, let's try this, or that was fantastic, do this.  And so you're, you know, you're, you're kind of in that head space with somebody else.  And, and, and, and they're, you know, it's, it's like a collaborative effort.  That's the best way I can say it. 
[01:47:30]  But like that movie, it was a great example of everything that the movie is about in the sense that like, you know, we had, we had black guys, Mexican guys, we had men and women.  I mean, you have like a, a mix of people making it together who all believe in what it's about.  And that helps too.  That helps too, you know.  Was that your favorite movie you did?  You know, I, I mean, they're like children.  It's like, it's hard to love one more than another, but I, I certainly liked the way that one came out.  I think it came out very much like we were setting out, you know, it, it did what we intended it to do. 
[01:48:00]  You obviously worked pretty hard on it, especially on your, uh, your body, to tell you the truth.  Have you ever had to work that hard getting in shape for another movie?  Where did it all go?  Where did it all go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then your next movie was Fight Club.  And, uh, you know, obviously you're not in bad shape, but it was nothing like, uh, you were in American History X.  Well, you had to make sure you look a lot softer than, uh, Brad Pitt in that movie.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we kind of decided I was going to kind of get sort of almost junky thin in that one. 
[01:48:30]  And he was going to kind of get more and more idealized, you know?  So, um, um, um, I, it was terrific.  He was like stuffing his face and lifting weights and I'm starving myself for six months.  And, um, somehow I don't think I get the good end of that deal, but it was, uh, it was fun.  You know what my biggest problem?  Because I do a little acting too.  Oh.  And, uh, my biggest problem when I act and I'm not particularly good is what to do with my hands.  Like they ever, they just kind of just hang there and I feel stupid and stiff. 
[01:49:00]  That's really funny you say that.  I, I think about that.  Like in theater sometimes I get that feeling like that.  What do I do with my hands feeling?  When you have to do a scene, I did one in acting class last night and it was from a Sam Shepard play where I have to, I have to, I have to play a guy who's like a, a kind of like, like almost like a Western type of vibe.  And, uh, I can't do accents at all.  And like whenever I act, I'm just horribly embarrassed and exposed.  And I feel like I'm trying hard and everybody just knows I suck.  Is that bad?  Like to actually have that when you're acting? 
[01:49:30]  You're going to have to move through that eventually.  But, um, yeah.  And what play was it?  Fool for Love?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just a scene where I'm trying to convince May to come with me that I bought some land in Wyoming.  I'm telling him what to play is stupid.  He knows.  Well, I'm trying to.  We have an homage to, to, in Down in the Valley.  Do you see that bit where I'm roping the chair in the hotel room?  Yes, I did.  Yeah, that's, that's sort of like, that's, that's because we love to fool for love.  Yeah, well done.  Uh, Jimmy, why don't you do the line for Edward Norton that you were doing last night? 
[01:50:00]  Uh, I just couldn't do it well.  Uh, I'm going to take care of you this time, May.  See?  That was good.  I thought that was good.  Thanks, Carl.  That was really bad.  It just didn't come off as good.  I wasn't feeling too well, though.  I had food poisoning.  But I also say this.  In fairness, as good of an actor, as brilliant as Edward Norton is as an actor, that was an  easy scene in American History X, because you can see they cast an Elliot Gould, because  he is the epitome of annoying kike.  Oh, my kike.  You know, he must have been like, ah, you kike.  Right?  Thank you, Colin, for alienating everybody. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's great, Colin.  Sorry about that, but I'm just trying to...  Are you guys up in Boston now?  Uh, we're in New York City.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  But we're hurt in Boston.  Oh, you're from Boston?  Uh...  We're from here, and...  And we were up in Boston for a while, doing radio, and then we said something about Mayor  Menino, and they threw us out of Boston.  Oh, that's terrific.  But then we came back, and...  We kind of told the whole city that he was dead for April Fool's.  You're from Boston, though, right?  Well, I was born there.  I was born up in Brigham Women's Hospital.  You ever get back there?  Yeah, now and then. 
[01:51:00]  Now and then.  Yeah, you hang with, like, old friends or something?  Or, um...  Yeah.  Yeah?  I mean, I'm from...  I've been in New York for 15 years, so my crew is all...  A lot of them are here.  You and I actually met at the Comedy Cellar one night.  You came down here...  Jim Norton.  Jim Norton, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jim Norton, which is funny.  That's my brother's name, but that guy is hilarious.  Well, that's who we're...  Oh, thank you.  That's the guy...  Sam Shepard actor.  Yeah, that's me, yeah.  That's the guy that was doing the acting class.  The bad Sam Shepard actor is Jim Norton, yeah.  And by the way, someone has to say it. 
[01:51:30]  Jimmy's a very good actor.  He's going to be seen on the HBO series Lucky Louie in June.  Well, it's funny.  Somebody has to say it.  That was what Edward said to me when he came out.  He said, that's my brother's name.  Yeah, and I bothered him for a picture upstairs, and he was very close.  Of course you did.  Why do you always have to bother everybody for a picture?  It's creepy.  Ask Edward Norton if he remembers how creeped out he was, that he's trying to be a peer to  you, and then you ask him for a picture.  All right, hold on.  Edward, do you remember being creeped out, or did you just think it was good-natured fun?  I thought it was pretty much good-natured, bad-taste humor. 
[01:52:00]  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  It was just, you know, two men of a similar ilk.  Because I go up to my good friends, my peers.  You talked about your nipples.  Do you remember that?  I did.  Oh, great.  Well, not to him after the show.  Probably on stage.  No, I wouldn't doubt you did after the show.  I think it was both.  He's a despicable man.  Oh, he remembered that.  Thank you.  Hey, Glenn wants to say hi to Edward Norton.  Let's say hi to Glenn.  Glenn, what's up? 
[01:52:30]  Hey, Edward, how are you?  It's Glenn Cunningham.  How you doing?  All right.  I wanted to thank you for working in that movie, Pride and Glory.  I had a good time with you, bro.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Were you working on that?  Yeah.  Remember we talked about Aikido and we were up in Harlem?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You must get this all the time.  I worked on a movie.  Yeah, Pride and Glory.  We're shooting it still right now in New York.  It's like a cop corruption film.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's all you have today. 
[01:53:00]  That's it, man.  Take care.  Good luck.  I'll see you in the open.  Way to bond.  Hey, Edward, do you remember Patrice O'Neill from 25th Hour?  Big black guy.  He was the, I guess, the doorman at the club you were going to.  I do remember that.  Yeah.  He's a good friend of ours in the show.  And he constantly talks about doing that movie and working with you.  I do remember him.  Yeah.  And we were constantly telling him, shut up. 
[01:53:30]  He's a chocolate man that can't eat chocolate.  Well, it was actually a scene with, I think, Edward and Philip Seymour Hoffman he got to do a scene with.  And he just said how nervous he was and how they had to come.  Two brilliant actors and Patrice.  I did a couple movies with Phil.  He's fantastic.  Yeah.  He never, this is what I like about him.  He never makes eye contact with people in a scene, which I think is great.  Because in my class, they just say, you got to look at the person in the eyes.  But I don't look at people in the eyes in real life.  I'm shifty and nervous all the time.  Well, again, I don't really know what to say to you. 
[01:54:00]  Say what you really feel inside, which is shut up, you rank amateur.  And don't ever bother me again with acting questions.  There's nothing wrong.  You dilettante idiot.  Jimmy's hoping that you guys are going to become friends.  Jimmy thinks you guys are going to be like studying together and doing Sham Shepard scenes.  Jimmy's hoping by the end of this interview, you go, can you put me on hold?  I want Jim Norton's phone number.  Yeah.  Maybe we can do a Sham Shepard play.  I hope he kicks you down the stairs at the cell the next time he sees you.  Nobody told me this was your show, Jim. 
[01:54:30]  Why didn't they tell me?  They probably didn't know.  I mean, they don't know all the friends I have that happen to be celebrities.  They don't give me any credit.  Because he's a third wheel.  Yeah, I am pretty much a third wheel.  You know something?  I love Rounders also.  Do you think that might have come out a couple of years too early?  I know they say it's just as bad to be too early as too late, right?  Yeah.  I mean, that movie is fantastic.  And now it's just such a cult favorite with people that play poker, who now is everybody.  Do you play?  I do play now.  And then the guys who wrote that film are good friends of mine. 
[01:55:00]  And then they really taught me a lot about the game.  And I'll still get into a home game now and then and beat everybody up.  You're not one of those that go around to the tournaments, though, a celebrity tournament?  Well, it's hard.  When I go play, if I go sit in a casino or something, everybody sees Worm walk in and they all want action.  So they just all bet into me.  I have to play pretty high stakes to get a straight game.  Yeah, I don't doubt it.  How amazing was it working with with De Niro and Brando doing scenes with those two? 
[01:55:30]  They're great.  They're great.  I knew both of them before it.  But it was a I mean, Bob, especially, that was like a dream come true.  Let me ask you something.  When you saw Norton's original act at The Cellar, did you ever dream you'd ask you a question that Byron Allen wouldn't even ask you how amazing it is to work with Brando De Niro?  I only thought.  How can you answer that other than it was great?  I just thought of it.  Shut your mouth.  Because I saw how much weight you put on.  So it made me think of Brando. 
[01:56:00]  I'm a little heavy.  It's true.  All right.  Hey, let's say hi to Cappy on Long Island.  Cappy, we got Edward Norton on the phone.  Hey, Edward.  American History X, you were a genius in that movie.  That's my absolute favorite movie of all time, man.  Is it difficult doing the prison rape scene?  I mean, it might sound like a silly question on the outside because, no, it's a piece of cake.  But I mean, what kind of mindset do you have to get into for that?  Well, most of the guys that we were doing that with were actually reformed ex-cons. 
[01:56:30]  Really?  Yeah.  And so I think fear was the operating emotion in that one.  They didn't really have a sense of like, you know, of how you fake it in a stunt.  You know what I mean?  Oh, damn.  That hurts.  Yeah, the realism there.  And the whole, I mean, you came off as kind of a despicable human being in that movie for the most part at the beginning, especially. 
[01:57:00]  But then also misguided and stuff.  But when that scene came up, you just really didn't expect it to happen to, you know, the major character in the scene.  So it made it that much more brutal.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  I mean, I like, you know, he's a character that kind of goes and starts in one place and ends up in a very different place, which is kind of interesting.  I mean, but like down in the valley, you just saw it.  It's kind of the opposite. 
[01:57:30]  It's like he's a very complicated character in this movie.  This guy, you know, he seems like incredibly charming and poetic.  Yeah, we should explain down in the valley a little more.  So he starts dating an underage girl and they're falling in love.  Like real love.  And then there's obviously some twists and turns.  The father's not into it at all.  A couple of problems.  And he also befriends the brother of his girlfriend.  Right.  And it's great. 
[01:58:00]  It's like a modern day movie.  But it ends up.  A modern day western, I'm sorry.  It is.  But I think you end up.  You know, we always felt like we wanted you to end up kind of where those kids end up about him.  Like not sure how you feel about the guy.  And, you know, I mean, he reminded me of like Cool Hand Luke or those characters I used to love who are kind of, there's something great about them.  But you just know they're never going to be able to get it together quite.  Yeah.  Right.  Edward, I was thinking there's a little taxi driver in there, too. 
[01:58:30]  Well, it's funny.  You know, there's a scene that people keep talking about that.  And we had this whole thing in our head of this one western that we love and him acting out this western.  But later when we looked at it, we realized there was there was kind of this weird echo of that.  But that's fine, too, because it's all a lot of it's about fantasy.  And and and I, you know, that that movie is so much in everybody's heads that I believe I buy that it's even in his in a way. 
[01:59:00]  I mean, that's this is like I mean, this is kind of like if you took Taxi Driver and transplanted it to the West, you know, it's like it's like it's one of those kinds of films.  But it's it's in a very different context.  But I mean, obviously, that's a classic, you know.  Hey, was there something with American History X, too?  People said that Tony Kaye wasn't happy with it or there's something he wanted to do that the studio made him do differently.  Was this what was with the film that he kind of thought about?  That was a little bit overinflated. 
[01:59:30]  Tony, Tony, we worked incredibly.  I loved working with Tony and and he and I had a great time throughout.  We worked, you know, on it all the way down.  He he he didn't want to finish.  I mean, he kind of wanted to keep going and they wanted to put it out.  And everyone, we were all trying to convince him it was it was, you know, at some report, certain points, I let it go.  And it was great.  But the funny thing is someone someone I know ran into him recently.  I haven't seen him in a little bit.  And I guess Tony turned to him and said, you know, I caught the film on TV the other night. 
[02:00:00]  It's really, it's really a good movie.  So I think he I think he kind of came around.  Yeah.  But but, yeah, you know, these kinds of movies.  The thing is, this one down the valley is like that one in the sense that we made it.  And, you know, you know, we made it for like the costume budget of other movies.  And and and it, you know, we're starting it out small in just a couple of cities.  It'll be just in New York this weekend.  And so we're we're you know, we're trying to let people know about it. 
[02:00:30]  It we've gotten great reviews for it.  But it's I mean, we probably have, you know, literally like one one thousandth of the marketing budget of a movie like Mission Impossible three.  And it's it's a it's a challenge.  It's it's it's challenging.  But it's a place where we're trying to let people know that, you know, you going to see it the first weekend, you can actually, in a lot of ways, make a difference in whether or not movies like this are getting out there.  So it's not in the marketing budget for you to jump on a horse and ride all over Manhattan, take a speedboat, yeah, all the traffic for a day. 
[02:01:00]  Thanks, Tom.  Thanks, Tom.  Rape Katie Holmes.  Jesus, Colin.  It comes out May 5th in New York and May 12th in L.A.  Tomorrow in New York, yeah, Friday.  Yeah.  The fourth.  Yeah.  W.W. Dot.  Down in the Valley dot com.  Down in the Valley.  Film dot com.  God, do I stink.  Down in the Valley.  Film dot com.  It's tough to talk about the movie because there's.  You enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed it.  And there's a lot of twists and turns. 
[02:01:30]  And it's hard to really discuss it without really giving away some of the key points of the movie.  But Edward's just a great actor.  If I may kiss your ass, sir.  You're really good.  I mean, I think I've been finding a lot.  It's funny.  The movie you guys have been saying you like.  I've been finding people who people who like Fight Club and 25th Hour and those kinds of movies are really enjoying this movie, you know.  Very good.  There's something about it.  But I loved you in the people versus Larry Flint as the attorney.  I like that one, too.  I like that film a lot.  That's one of my favorite things you did. 
[02:02:00]  That's another of that's another of my films.  I liked it.  That was a complete commercial failure.  Was it really?  Oh, yeah.  You got to get a couple of those in.  Oh, I get a lot of those in.  Does it make you want to throw up, though, when that movie doesn't like do as well as they wanted it to?  And you see like bringing down the house, breaking a hundred million.  Don't you just want to open fire?  You do wonder, like, what your fellow citizens, like, you know, are actually made of.  They just want to line them up on a curb.  I guess. 
[02:02:30]  You got to check how Dunstan checks in.  It's really good.  All right.  Let's let Edward Norton go.  Edward Norton, this was a thrill for us, I got to tell you.  Yeah.  Huge fan, man.  It was a pleasure.  It's Down in the Valley, comes out tomorrow in New York and then next Friday in Los Angeles.  It's downinthevalleyfilm.com.  Excellent.  You guys be good.  Take care, man.  Thanks for calling in.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Edward Norton, everyone.  The best part is that Jim Norton looks like Edward Frolong in American history.  I don't remember him.  Shut up.  He's the little brother, you idiot.  What do I know?  I'm just too busy talking to my other acting friend.  You know, I hate when he says this because now he had more of a connection with Edward Norton than any of us did. 
[02:03:00]  So now he's playing it.  He didn't break his leg like Ed Norton did to the black dude in American history acts on the curb.  He put his face on the curb.  He put his teeth on there and just step on the back of his head.  That was a good scene.  That was cathartic.  Brutal.  Cathartic.  Yeah.  Right?  Very cathartic.  From guys like Edward Norton and myself.  Like, shut your mouth.  We get together.  We talk.  I mean, it's just what happens.  Yeah.  You stink.  Well, I stink.  I can't help it.  All right, listen.  We've got to wrap up the first half of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:03:30]  We're going to continue on XM for a few hours.  We've got Greg from Caroline's.  He's got a gift for Jimmy.  Colin Quinn's at Caroline's all weekend long, tonight through Sunday, 2-1-2...  7-5-7-4-100, I think.  For tickets.  I'll be there, Colin.  I'll be supporting Colin Quinn at Caroline's this weekend.  By the way, he always shows up, and Anthony never does.  If you're not doing anything next weekend, Colin, I'm doing the Orpheum with David Tell.  We need an opening act.  Well, would you like to come see All Dulled Up?  It's a training play.  I actually would.  I know you would.  Hey, Jimmy, were you playing... 
[02:04:00]  It was hilarious.  Were you playing with David Tell any time, like, within the past couple of days?  No.  Were you?  I got a phone call.  Even to you.  Somebody just called my cell phone.  I pick it up, and it's one of those...  They inadvertently dialed my number, so now I've got to sit in on the conversation and  hear things.  And it was just David Tell's act.  Weird.  It was like David Tell either on TV or live in a club or something.  So who the hell knows me that was listening to David Tell?  No clue.  It was Norton.  He's still there.  And you can't hang up because you've got to listen and see if they say something bad  about you. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  We've got to hurry up because we've got two minutes left.  Greg Charles, what do you got?  You don't have to bring me...  Greg Charles has a gift for Norton.  A gift for Jimmy.  Greg, you guys don't have to do that.  Greg.  Of course.  Jimmy.  You really don't.  You like the wrapping.  Please tell me if it's Colin Quinn's poster and it says canceled.  Maybe it's that picture of New Year's Eve.  Can I open this up?  That hurts.  Brent Charles from Caroline's.  A gift for Jimmy.  Because he didn't get one the other day.  He's making good.  Here it is.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  Post there and it says sold out.  Very nice. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, that's really nice, Jimmy.  Thank you very much.  Oh, my God.  After signing this new deal, that sold out has a whole new meaning.  You look like a beautiful little Nambla victim.  Thank you, Greg.  You stupid tadpole.  Everybody at Caroline's.  Thank you.  That looks like a tadpole.  That is a sexy little picture of Jimmy.  That's my Caroline's when I was there and it actually says sold out in red letters.  Couldn't you have photoshopped a breathe right strip on his nose?  He doesn't leave home without it these days.  He's a psychopath.  I can't breathe otherwise.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We got two more things we got to do and we only have like a minute left in this half of 
[02:05:30]  the show.  Dr. Ian Smith, you got to make good right now.  I'm giving away books.  Yes.  Dr. Ian Smith has a great book out.  It's called Fat Smash Diet.  Our own Nathaniel lost like 15 pounds on it.  It's working great for him and many other people out there.  A lot of people using it.  And we've been promoting the book like crazy.  It is working.  And he brought like two books to give away to our listeners last time.  So I got 75 books.  Wow.  75 books.  Wow.  Go to fatsmashdiet.com. 
[02:06:00]  Wait a minute.  There's no porno on that website, right?  No, no, no.  All right.  I guess we can promote it then.  Fatsmashdiet.com.  Yeah.  And we're going to do a challenge.  We're going to do an open anti-fat smash challenge.  We'll talk about it later.  Ooh, a tease.  A little tease, huh?  How about that?  You'll take some of the emails and just randomly give out about 75 books.  Yeah.  First 75 emails.  That's very cool of Dr. Ian Smith.  All right.  Tomorrow in this half of the program, we're giving out the tool tickets.  We got the cold hard cash, all the prizes in the minefield of mousetraps that Stalker  Patty tried out today. 
[02:06:30]  Patty, thank you so much for doing that and getting nothing for it.  We greatly appreciate it.  Really fast before we leave this half of the show, big ass members on the phone, just  got to rehab with Lady Di.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  What's up, Bam?  We just got here.  She's being processed in for the, I guess, five to seven day detox.  Good.  She went without much of a whimper other than her welfare, her welfare, whatever.  I don't know.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  But I just hope she dies during detox. 
[02:07:00]  Bam drops her off and hopes her death.  That's how we help people on the Opie and Anthony program.  You're a breath of fresh air, Bam.  Godspeed.  Well, she's in and being processed in.  Let's see if she stays in for the five days.  Yeah, I think it's five to seven day detox.  And then I think it's a 28 day rehab if she makes it.  And then there's probably some kind of counseling that she can go to.  And I'm sure they'll clean her up and give her a little robe to wear or something.  Well, good for her.  Hey, Bam, tell her to call us.  Can you call from these places?  Yeah, I think they can. 
[02:07:30]  She can.  All right, tell her to call and give us a progress report.  I say she lasts...  Three days.  Twelve hours.  Wow.  Twelve hours.  You think she's ready?  Yep.  That seemed like a person that was ready?  Yeah, man.  She's a compulsive liar.  I can't wait to do this.  She's actually getting in the rehab.  Well, the good news is she's not anywhere near to her home, so she can't just leave and  walk down the street like last time.  Three days.  She's too ugly to hitchhike.  We'll pick her up.  All right, so Lady Di has made it to detox.  We'll see what happens. 
[02:08:00]  Good luck.  I got to go get my card detailed now.  All right.  Anything else you want to add, Bam?  No, that's around it.  Thanks, Bam.  Good job, man.  Bam does great stuff for the Opie and Anthony program.  The O&A Pests do a lot, and we greatly appreciate it.  All right, Bam.  Let's hit the streets.  See you later.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, we're hitting the streets.  We'll broadcast live now from the streets of New York as we get to the other studio.  We'll see you tomorrow if you don't have XM.  Today, we're going to have Club Soda Candy skipping all six foot six of him and throwing  dollar bills up in the air as we walk to the other studio. 
[02:08:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  Excuse me.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All I want is to get laid and eat sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy.  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when you want to change the rocks?  See Opie and Anthony show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  Love you too, sweetie.  If you walk past them, they'll take your jewelry, take your purse, you know, you have no idea 
[02:09:00]  what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Freaky.  No.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  This is the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings six to nine.  Do, do, do, do, do, do.  Are we on the radio?  We are on the radio.  Hi.  Do you want to sign autographs?  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, what? 
[02:09:30]  No, we can do it outside XM.  We'll sign some stuff.  It'll kill some time.  Ugh.  Yeah.  It's all about killing time.  Ugh.  I want to deal with people.  Most watch on this heart of mine, my stomach hurts.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  How cool was Edward Norton?  Great.  That was pretty good.  Someone said I was homo for him.  I saw the phone call.  It's like, is Anthony homo for Edward Norton?  Why?  Because I commented that he was buff?  Yeah.  He did have a great vibe.  I commented open. 
[02:10:00]  That I think he's a great actor?  Yeah.  He's wonderful.  He's captivating.  Someone on the instant feedback said I was sexy.  Uh-oh.  Someone on the instant feedback?  Yes.  I said I was stepping all over him.  I was just nervous to talk to him, man.  That's a big get for us.  I hear if we were nice enough to him, he might actually come in in the summer.  I'd be here in New York.  Now, that'd be cool.  Think of the picture, Jim.  Oh, you already have a picture with the...  Yeah, I do.  I'd get it signed, though.  By the way, where's Colin Quinn?  He was chasing Bill. 
[02:10:30]  Chasing Bill with Jim's poster, which he threw down in the Free FM lobby.  He's trying to break my poster.  You know what I think?  He thinks it's bogus because he's never seen sold out on a Caroline's poster.  That was a really nice poster, too.  I can't believe he would break that.  He's trying to break it.  I can.  I think you really like that poster, right?  He's jealous, I think.  I know.  All right, here's the deal today.  We're going to be walking to the XM Studios.  Yep.  We got, I don't know, close to $100 cash in all ones.  And we're going to get Club Soda Kenny, 6'6", skipping down the sidewalk and just throwing 
[02:11:00]  dollar bills in the air.  Just throwing money in the air.  Hello.  Hi, Kenny.  What?  I can't hear it.  What am I, am I supposed to talk?  We're just saying hi.  Oh, hello.  Hello, everyone.  It's a beautiful day.  I'm going to be throwing away monies.  All right.  I'll hand the money over to Club Soda Kenny.  Let's start the walk to XM.  We'll just walk.  Satellite radio.  We'll just walk.  We'll just walk.  Like we do now every day. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, and the crowd's getting bigger and bigger every day, I know.  And Master Poe is ushering people away.  Oh, nice job.  Hey, hey.  Hey, how you doing there?  Hey, the bus driver from yesterday.  The bus driver.  Rich Voss wanted to get on that bus yesterday and do some stand-up.  A lot of fans of the show on the walk.  Very surprised.  I guess it's the low self-esteem.  You think no one's listening.  Then you get some people coming out of cabs, holding up wow stickers, beeping their horns.  Waving.  Waving, even. 
[02:12:00]  I just wanted to throw a gesture in there so people knew I was here today.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right.  Let's get Club Soda Kenny to do the first skip from here to the bus stop, Brady.  Club Soda Kenny, all six foot six of them just throwing money in the air as he skips.  Just throwing money.  Look at this guy backing up.  He has an iPod, and the guy's just backing up going, what the hell's going on?  Kenny's just skipping, throwing.  Oh, look.  An Asian woman just picks them up.  She likes that.  There's men in suits actually wrestling for a dollar.  Look at him skipping to the corner. 
[02:12:30]  People are picking him up.  Of course they are.  I'm bringing up the rear.  Two of Anthony's neighbors are following us.  And there you go.  Whoa.  That one made it into the street.  Skip across the street, Kenny.  Tell him to go across the street.  Look.  There's one in the middle of traffic.  Yeah, go in traffic.  Whoa, there he goes, flying.  This guy's going to try to stop a car to get a dollar bill.  This wasn't the smartest idea.  I think Kenny should... 
[02:13:00]  Opie.  Opie.  Yes.  I think Kenny should, when the light is red, skip right through traffic throwing the money  so the money will get swept down the street by the cars.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Why don't we just put it on a Klansman's hat and send him through Harlem with dollars taped  to him.  Okay.  All right.  Are you ready to do your next skip?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's cross.  Here we go.  Let's cross this way.  Tony Bennett.  Huh?  Tony Bennett.  Where's Tony Bennett?  He's right here. 
[02:13:30]  Where's Tony Bennett?  Don't yell at him.  Look, he's going.  Hi, Tony.  Tony doesn't like us.  Hi, Tony.  Leave Tony alone.  He doesn't want Tony alone.  Leave him alone.  We see him every day.  He's shaking his head.  Tony's not coming back this way.  Wow.  It's Tony Bennett, for God's sake.  We love him.  Why didn't you offer him some of those dollars in your hand?  What happened?  What happened, Kenny?  I don't know.  He's not into it.  Of course he's not.  I know.  Did you see the corner he cut?  He was walking across the road.  He saw us and cut through traffic. 
[02:14:00]  What's that?  Jimmy is sexy.  Jimmy is sexy?  Hold on a minute.  All right, Jimmy.  Bring the whore over.  Who are you?  Hi.  My name is Betsy.  Hi, Jimmy.  I think you're sexy.  Oh, thank you, Betsy.  How are you?  Wow.  Good.  Nice to meet you.  Do you have a gentleman friend?  I'm married.  Where is your husband?  He's a...  Well, I'm going to do a cartwheel.  Yeah.  Yeah, do a cartwheel for a dollar.  I just hope the cancer wig doesn't fall off.  I just hope the cancer wig doesn't fall off.  I can see that.  Oh, jeez.  Leave Dutch paint hairdo alone. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  She's doing cartwheels for everybody.  Oh, I saw you.  Purple panties.  Wait, you got a thong.  Let's turn around here.  We saw your purple thong.  We saw it.  Where do you live?  I can go there.  Where do you live?  I'm in New Jersey.  Okay.  No, you're not.  You're in Manhattan.  Well, no, I live in New Jersey.  I know I'm in Manhattan.  I thought you were confused.  Do you want to take the walk with us?  I'll take the walk.  Okay.  All right.  Do your husband get mad if we make out in the toilet?  I don't think we're...  He's a gymnast.  It says what?  You're from some gymnastic academy?  Yes. 
[02:15:00]  I teach, so...  You teach?  Yeah.  How old are your students?  Young.  How old?  Too young for you.  One?  You'd be surprised.  Is there eight?  Is there any other moves you could do on the sidewalk for us?  Do you do splits?  You guys want to see a split?  I want to see a split.  All right.  Will I get another dollar?  Yes, you will.  Yeah, you'll get another dollar.  All right.  Oh, Kenny just hung up on her husband. 
[02:15:30]  All right, here she goes.  A split.  Hey.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  She's very sexy.  Jimmy thinks you're very sexy, too.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I like the fact you can do splits and things with that ilk.  My husband does, too.  Are you dirty?  What's that?  Are you, like, dirty with your gymnastics now?  Because now that you're a little older and you can't compete, really, you can teach, but  you can't compete.  Do you use it for dirty sex now, your gymnastics abilities?  That's a secret.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, stand on your hands and then do a split, and your hubby can just dig right in? 
[02:16:00]  Um, well, you know, I'll leave it to your imagination.  Huh?  No, don't do that, because you want to decapitate it in.  All right.  Let's go.  Can you do the handstand split?  Uh.  Another dollar.  Another dollar.  Another dollar.  Can you do that, where you do a handstand and a split?  All right, here we go.  It's just the New York City sidewalk.  It's clean.  Don't worry about it.  It's clean.  Don't worry about it.  Here we go.  The gymnast is doing another move here.  The handstand split. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, you stand on your hands, and then you do a split.  This I want to see.  Look at it.  You can tell she's very muscular.  Yeah, you got those, uh, here we go.  Gymnast's thighs.  Very nice.  Well, I was close.  Well, you didn't hold it.  I was close.  You didn't hold it.  You didn't hold it.  You got to hold it a little bit.  Yeah.  No, you're not getting that other leg over enough.  No, no, no.  You got to get the other leg over.  Yeah, one more time.  One more time.  The leg isn't going over enough.  There you go.  There it is.  Nice.  Wow. 
[02:17:00]  Very good.  And we got to see the thong again.  Yeah, that was the goal of having to do it three times.  Would you like to hug Jimmy before we move on?  Sure.  I'll hug him.  Ooh, a little Jimmy hug.  No.  I guess the hug is okay.  No, you need, you got to pay me another dollar.  You can't get AIDS from a hug.  Remember.  All right, we got to walk.  Thank you.  A little gasping now when she hugs me.  All right, Kenny, if you will, start skipping again and throwing the dollar bills.  All right, right across the streak.  Kenny, there he goes.  Mr. Moneybags.  Look at him go.  He's just throwing money.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  A lady stops with her baby to pick up money on the street.  He's just throwing money.  All right.  You know, these cheap bastards that came for the walk with us are taking all the money.  It's not for them.  It's for people on the streets also.  Opie, how are we going to solve that problem?  Jesus.  I'm hoping someone gets decapitated by the cabs.  See, I see a problem.  The people that are following us are taking all the money, and then the people walking  down the street aren't really getting any. 
[02:18:00]  It's like just handing them money.  Who's that with the hat?  How much do you have already, you fat fuck?  Oh, very much.  How much?  Seven.  Seven.  Lucky seven.  So you've taken seven dollars already.  Seven fucking bucks.  Jesus Christ.  That means Comeback City is on.  Did somebody throw braces up in the air?  You want me to give it back?  It just blew my mind.  Shut up, would you?  Oh, my God.  Kenny took the dollar back from Stalker Patty.  Well, he should.  We're right across the street.  Now we're going to miss the signal. 
[02:18:30]  Hey, everybody.  I see Colin Quinn way up in the window on the fifth floor.  The fifth floor.  That's the XM Satellite Radio Studios.  What is he doing?  He's got something planned.  He's got something planned.  How are we going to walk underneath?  He's ripping stuff up and throwing it out the window.  It's probably Jimmy's.  There you go, Jimmy.  He's a tender sentiment for you.  We're waiting for the light to change so we can cross the street.  What is he ripping up besides not his lunch order, that fucking fatso? 
[02:19:00]  I'm sure it's something of yours, Jimmy.  He ripped up your tender sentiment.  He really doesn't like you.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  Did he wreck the bitch, that jackass?  What did he rip up?  Oh, those are the tender sentiments?  And I'm going to smash you.  He ripped up Jimmy's tender sentiments.  That's not nice.  All right.  And I'm going to smash it.  All right, here we go.  Kenny continues skipping and throwing the dollar bills as we make our way to XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, look at him throwing money around.  Throwing money.  What a guy. 
[02:19:30]  Look at him just throwing cold, hard cash.  You can't pick the money up with your camera.  What are you doing?  The intern's picking it up.  Former child star is picking up the dollar bills.  The lady's pushing her baby to try to get one, and the fucking intern is doing it.  Uh-oh.  Oh, okay.  The cop's just turning.  He's just turning.  All right.  I don't think we'll be arrested.  For what?  Oh, I see why he's in this area. 
[02:20:00]  Why?  Well, look at some of the people on the corner.  He's just taking a peek.  Could be a problem.  He's just taking a peek.  We're just about at XM, outside XM.  Is Colin Quinn still in the window?  Yes.  There they are.  I'm actually up at the end.  I'm cutting up Jim's tums and putting them in his banana.  Get a little salute from a couple of police officers out there.  Yeah, watch out when you walk under the window.  I don't know what Colin wants to drop on us. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, did he throw them out?  That's good.  You ruined the bit.  That's smart.  Ruined the bit.  What a dope.  That bit was ruined to me.  It started.  Well, here we are.  No smoothies.  No nothing.  We get right upstairs today.  Yeah.  We got a busy day.  All right.  Wow.  We got a hell of a crowd with us.  The crowd is growing every day.  We hate you all.  Bye, guys.  Thanks for following us today.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll sign really fast.  I think a couple of people made two or three bucks. 
[02:21:00]  Maybe a little more than that.  A little more than that, Jim.  Anthony's gone.  All right.  We may be back on the air in a matter of moments.  You guys are right there.  You're good.  Oh, you got me right here.  I do.  Oh, okay.  You want an answer?  All right.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is it?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  People played on TV screens, drawings. 
[02:21:30]  They ran fast and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women.  Viruses spreading in our area.  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button.  I'm a black ninja, fuck face.  All right.  We remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot.  There's going to be some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log they're going to have.  Holy shit. 
[02:22:00]  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  Envy.  Oh.  With O.B.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old Ben.  Ah!  Oh, snap!  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock!  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when lost stuff stuff. 
[02:22:30]  Shut up!  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, hi.  Look, I know how to make it into the elevator on time.  O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:23:00]  It's O.B. and Anthony Mark II.  It's our second show of the day.  We are the hardest working people in radio.  How come I always make it up first now?  O.B. decides to take the second elevator.  Ha ha ha!  I'm not stupid.  Ha ha ha!  You like, you stroll in.  I'm like, I'm running from the elevator into here  because I know there's just a matter of seconds  to get on the air.  O.B. strolls in.  Hey! 
[02:23:30]  Don't throw out the nice present I made for you.  Uh, yeah, O.B.'s, uh, uh, Jimmy's very angry.  Yeah, because you're up of tender sentiments.  That's a bit.  I know it is.  Well, you don't ruin bits.  I know it is.  Well, I would not ruin a good bit.  It happens to be a fine bit.  We like that bit.  I know it was hilarious, but it's, I guess, time came.  Nothing happens for, everything happens for a reason.  It was Jimmy's reason enough.  Yeah, but we left him one tender sentiment.  He'd keep rereading that one every day.  Way to go.  You threw it out?  See, the problem is we need a bit to replace that now, Colin. 
[02:24:00]  I'll write one up.  Because you get to go home and we have to still make up crap every day.  Yeah.  Tender sentiments, huh?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  The second half of the O.B. and Anthony program has begun.  Hi.  I'm just getting a pal talk up here because the people get a little upset if it's not up there  right away.  And we're getting our stuff put out in front of us.  That's what the first few things.  Kenny, can we get smoothies today?  Sure.  What would you like, sir?  Protein smoothie.  Huh?  You know something.  There you go.  Dr. Ian Smith said more protein. 
[02:24:30]  I hate this because by the time I go home, I'm going to be gurgling and percolating.  But I love those banana strawberry smoothies.  Would you like protein with yours?  Now, what is that going to do for me?  Ask Dr. Ian Smith.  A little sprinkle for energy.  Dr. Ian, is it for energy or is it for like, you know something?  No, I don't want it.  Oh, boy.  I just want the good taste.  No, it doesn't affect the taste. 
[02:25:00]  It doesn't affect the taste.  It does.  It will help your energy during the day.  You can taste it.  Yeah, try it.  It tastes a little bitter, but it's not bad.  Shut up, Jimmy.  All right.  Okay.  Get him some.  Get him some.  Do you like some skim milk?  My goodness.  Skim milk?  Yeah.  That might help.  All right, here.  Here's the extra money from the walkover.  Just banana strawberry.  That's good.  Everyone is excited. 
[02:25:30]  They want the dump report.  We should get the dump report in minutes.  All right.  We'll get the dump report soon.  Okay.  Let me see.  Before we go to the dump report, we got another update from...  Holy shit.  Two pages?  Yeah.  We have another update from...  Let me see it.  ...big-ass member.  Well, as you guys expected, Lady Di is refusing to accept treatment.  Is she?  Wait, wait.  What happened?  Fucker.  She is calling that she wants to get off with some suspension on New Jersey Medicare, and 
[02:26:00]  she has to go back to New Jersey, and they say, don't worry about it.  You'll deal with it after the detox period.  We'll detox you here.  She's like, no, no, no.  I got to go back to the office.  So I have washed my hands of that lady.  I left her in Yonkers, New York.  What a piece of shit.  I'm going to give her $7 to get home.  What a piece of shit.  Oh, you ditched her.  Good, good.  I ditched her.  Bam, you're a hero.  Good.  You ditched her.  And she deserves it.  I told her, it's rehab.  That's stupid. 
[02:26:30]  She's going to walk right down the street to a liquor store, spend that $7 I give her,  and be stuck in Yonkers.  Stupid bitch.  Good for her.  Stupid bitch.  She could have been in a detox.  Seven days, cleaning up, getting her fingernails clipped and cleaned, getting her hair washed,  washing her body, and getting some help, and she decides no.  And it's not because this one, this welfare thing, and that she just wants to drink herself  to death. 
[02:27:00]  There you go.  Godspeed.  Have fun, fatso.  Get in there and kill yourself.  And she's an hour and a half from where she lives.  Good.  See what happens when you try to help?  Good for you to leave her there, too.  That intervention.  So what happened?  She was signing in, and then she just got cold feet and left?  Yeah, because they can't deal with New Jersey Medicaid.  But they said, don't worry about it.  We'll lose money on you, and we'll detox you.  And then when you get back to New Jersey, we'll get you back to New Jersey.  When we get back, you just tell them you're in detox. 
[02:27:30]  And they'll deal with it when you get back.  But now she wants to deal with it now.  That's the reason why she can't stay around.  So, you know, fuck her.  All right.  Well, thanks, Bam.  Bam has left Lady Di somewhere in Yonkers.  I had such faith, too.  Yeah, you believed this time.  I said, what did I say?  I said 12 hours, I think.  I see things through the naive eyes of a young boy.  Wow.  I gave her a lot of...  See, you don't need tender sentiment.  You make up your own. 
[02:28:00]  That was a pretty tender sentiment.  They help, though, when things are blue.  Shut up.  There were like four of them.  Four shitty ones in a fucking Kleenex box, and you're telling me it's a bitch?  Go fuck yourself, loser.  It's something that we like very much on this radio program.  And they helped me get through sad times.  No, there was many more to be read.  No, there was four.  There were many.  All right, Bam.  Thank you.  When I wasn't looking, like a magical gift, more tender sentiments would appear.  Let's go to James, the bus driver.  James, you were outside?  Yeah, I was outside. 
[02:28:30]  Seeing that big six-foot-six ugly son of a bitch skipping down the street was the funniest  fucking thing I've seen in a while.  Ugly.  He's in a suit.  He's skipping and throwing money in the air as we walked today.  It was fucking hilarious.  It was beautiful.  Our own interns are picking the money up.  The problem is for the XM, they're dumping out of you guys in the morning time on 92.3.  Oh, we know that.  We're going into it.  Even on the XM.  Well, yeah, I'm hearing something's happening now that it's being dumped on the XM side.  What are you talking about, sir?  Explain. 
[02:29:00]  A couple of curses and everything were dumped out on the XM side this morning.  Now, what do you mean?  Which ones and how do you know?  It was definitely a fuck was dumped out of it.  It's happened a couple of times yesterday also.  When I said fuck?  I believe so.  No, because I stopped myself.  That's why.  Opie stopped himself.  It sounded like a dump.  So what did you hear?  Did you hear Opie go fuck and then didn't hear the rest?  Yeah.  So I thought it was definitely a dump.  No, that's what happened.  He stopped himself.  He stopped himself.  But it was enough where they dumped.  All right, bud. 
[02:29:30]  It was good to meet you on the streets once again.  All right.  Long time listener from NAW.  I hope you hear the...  Margie in Connecticut, what's up?  I had enough of you.  I just wanted to tell you guys that the walkover has got to be the funniest part of the show.  You like the walk?  I love it.  I'm a huge fan.  Started listening to you when you first came to XM.  And I just want to tell you, it makes me laugh every morning.  Wait, where's the chick that likes me?  Why don't we bring her up?  No, Jimmy Norton, I'm going to come see you at Gotham, right?  I'm going to come see you at Gotham.  Next Thursday, I am doing a benefit with... 
[02:30:00]  It's for our friend, Mousavi, his son.  We're doing...  It's me, Patrice.  Colin, are you doing that?  Yes, I'm around.  I'm going to do it.  What if you're around?  What would you be besides maybe...  I don't know.  Maybe out of town.  You never know.  Jim, I got to come see you there.  I'm going to bring my girlfriend.  Colin, it's for a good cause.  Me, Patrice, Billy Burr, Vinnie Brand, Voss.  It's a really good show.  Come to Caroline's this weekend.  All right, Margie.  Come to Caroline's this weekend.  Thank you so much, you guys.  I enjoy it.  Every morning.  All right.  Yeah, the crowd is getting larger and larger every morning.  It's growing.  I'm going to come see you guys.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Hey, why doesn't somebody tell Carl and Quint to shut the fuck up and stop touching little  Jimmy's stuff?  Oh.  Carl, I got to agree.  I got to agree.  Really, Carl?  How about if I kick you in your face, stupid?  Oh, yeah.  Like you're that tough.  Come on.  Everybody's that tough behind the mic, right?  Yep.  That's right.  That's true.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  Carl, leave little Jimmy's shit alone.  Jimmy, I love you.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, Carl.  It's not his birthday and his shit stinks. 
[02:31:00]  And that's why I'm throwing it out.  It is my birthday.  Let's go to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff?  Oh.  Yes.  Hey, yeah, a little Jimmy should get to rip up Colin's appearance check for that one.  You suck, Colin.  I don't have an appearance.  Your show was erased from Comedy Central, and they erased your frickin' tapes from MTV  up that dumb remote control show of yours.  Remote control.  Yeah.  A lot of people are really mad that you ripped up Jimmy Norris.  That's right.  Tend to sentiments.  I think I care.  Yes.  Oh, Jimmy?  Not going to work, sir.  Even though you're defending me, I can't be gotten. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  There you go.  To the dump sheet.  All right.  By the way, again, I am becoming quite the expert, because I knew every single one of  these would be dumped out.  Yeah.  Some of them, pretty easy.  Other ones, I just knew.  I thought Kenny's stuff would get dumped, and it did, too.  Yep, and it did.  Of course it did.  All right.  Here it is.  6.05 a.m.  Don't we go on at 6?  Yeah.  Well, after the long intro and stuff, yeah.  It was 6.05.  So this is seconds into us speaking. 
[02:32:00]  Opie drops the F-bomb.  Opie.  It says, 6.05 a.m.  Fuck.  Opie frustrated at the mics.  Well, they were really, really bassy.  Yeah.  And then they changed mics after the first break, and then it was fine after that.  6.26 a.m.  Quote, it splashed and sprayed all over the newspapers.  Club Soda Kenny describing a guy in a diaper going to the bathroom on the studio floor.  In the context of that, you just can't describe it that graphically. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, the gang that was listening on terrestrial radio didn't get to hear all this goodness.  A mere minutes later, 6.33 a.m., quote, something will be pouring out of him.  Club Soda Kenny again after telling somebody on the street that the guy just finished taking  a fleet enema, and he's in a diaper.  So after you say the fleet enema thing, and then something will be pouring out of him, the  whole thing together, it becomes bad.  Wow.  Only a couple of minutes later, 6.35 a.m., I dumped 18 times yesterday. 
[02:33:00]  No Filter Paul on the phone talking about his experience drinking a laxative and going  to the bathroom in a diaper.  And this was right after we told No Filter Paul, don't be stupid.  Watch how you put this.  Well, I'll say this for No Filter Paul's defense.  As much as he is an ass, he doesn't know the rules.  I dumped, you'd think, we'll be cleaning it up enough, so I've got to give him a break  there.  Too descriptive.  But he doesn't know that, and I'm not siding with him.  Like, overall, he is garbage, but in that case, you've got to give him the pass.  6.42 a.m., fucking hot. 
[02:33:30]  Caller on the phone describing his girlfriend.  Could be true, could be false, can't be on the air.  7.08 a.m., I found that on whackbag.com, like we told you.  We're working on getting the website names on the show, being allowed to do that.  Lawyers are going over things and stuff.  There are just certain things, content that's on websites that can't be endorsed in certain  ways. 
[02:34:00]  But believe me, we're working on it.  We'll be able to do this in the near future, so don't get all upset.  Whackbag, whackbag, whackbag.  Whackbag.com.  Whackbag.com.  We love whackbag.  FullblownAids.com.  FullblownAids.com.  Whackbag.com.  There you go.  And join our MySpace account.  PalTalk, PalTalk, PalTalk.  MySpace slash Anthony Cumia.  Robert Kelly.  RobertKelly.com.  I'm happy you gave it out, because that's not his site.  It's RobertKellyLive.com.  Who got RobertKelly.com? 
[02:34:30]  Hopefully a fucking decent comic.  Hopefully a comic under 400 pounds.  Not a feral hog.  A mere few minutes later, it's 7-Eleven.  Should be butchered.  Staring into fucking space.  Bob's feet are a delicacy.  What was the last dump there? 
[02:35:00]  Staring into fucking space.  Marion on the phone.  That was Marion on the phone.  I thought it was Bob at the Pamplona running in the booth.  Look at Bob chasing everybody.  To the streets of Spain.  7.19 a.m.  It's about fucking time.  That is a caller trying to help Lady Di.  At 7.39 a.m.  Our own mess.  Ben.  Because Patty's a fucking mess.  That was his quote.  Ben got dumped out of, I believe, Ben's first curse on the FM and first dump. 
[02:35:30]  7.43 a.m.  Other shit from Stalker Patty.  She said, other shit.  And at 8.09 a.m.  Patty said, oh shit.  And those are your dumps for this day.  For someone.  May 4th.  You know what?  For someone who wants to be treated like a lady, she has a mouth like a trucker whore.  Potty mouth.  Definitely.  A mouth.  You know what that mouth needs?  Uh-oh.  Big fat cuck. 
[02:36:00]  Big fat one, Ann.  Big fat cuck.  More girth than length.  Dominican cuck.  Yeah, uncut, of course.  Unclipped, as they say.  I think it's pretty clean speaking, considering she's got a mouth trap in her.  You guys, let's go right to the phone.  Marion's on the phone.  Marion?  Hi, how are you?  Hi, Marion.  Hey, guys.  What happened with Diana?  Did she go to rehab or did you ship her back to Elizabeth?  Well, it turns out Bam drove her to the rehab center.  She was going to, they looked into it.  They were going to take her, put her on a seven-day rehab,  and then maybe continue after that for the 20-some-odd days that it takes to get her life in order. 
[02:36:30]  For those seven days that she was in, she would have gotten cleaned up off the booze.  They would have cleaned her up physically, some type of counseling,  maybe get her life back on the road, find out why she's having these problems.  A lot of solutions could have been made.  But she decided at the last minute, no, I'm not doing this.  I have to blah, blah, blah, lie, lie, bullshit, bullshit.  And she left, and now Bam didn't drive her back to the train station, just ditched her there. 
[02:37:00]  And now she's walking, which will take her about seven hours.  In the city of Gratia's living.  Yonkers, New York.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I want to thank you a lot for trying to help her, because I don't want to see her dead.  Well, we do.  Marion, let's be honest.  You really called that, they really put a lot of effort into that rehab.  I know that.  Because the intervention, that was the meanest intervention I've ever heard.  I wanted to start using drugs.  Wait, Marion, let me ask you a question.  Yeah, hi, Jim.  You're concerned with Diana.  She might be listening. 
[02:37:30]  I gave up.  I gave up for a while.  Shut up for a second and let Jimmy talk, for the love of Jesus.  If you could say anything to her right now to try to get her rescued, what would you say to her?  She's my best.  Brutal.  Let's go to Sally in Chicago.  Sally.  Hi.  I'm concerned that I'm suffering from a fatal case of the virus.  I can't even make a cup of tea without putting the teabag into the water and thinking something dirty now. 
[02:38:00]  Like teabagging.  Nice.  Yes.  See?  Also, you can call that thing, when you go to the graveyard, you could call it visiting your mom's box.  Your mom's box, which would be the coffin that is under the tombstone.  Can I just give you guys some advice about that Mother's Day idea?  Yes, Colin.  I heard it this morning and all I can think, and I only say this out of concern and love for you guys,  all I thought was St. Patrick's all over again.  Does it seem like something that might get us in that big of trouble?  It really, really does.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Videotape, put on a website.  Wait, Colin's actually being serious?  I'm worried about you guys.  Don't worry about us.  We got this under control.  Oh, boy.  Now I'm worried.  Famous last words.  Now I'm worried when Opie says that.  Famous last words.  The idea's pretty good, though.  The idea's fun.  I'm just talking.  We'll give it to you.  You think there might be an outcry, some kind of problem that might make the papers.  We'll give it to Florentine for Meet the Creeps.  How's that?  That's a Meet the Creeps bit.  Wow.  Yeah.  That will do, and he'll tape. 
[02:39:00]  Your mama is so dead.  And could you see mourners, like, just placing flowers on Mother's Day?  And big, fat Patrice just standing there doing mama jokes?  Hysterical.  He'll be arrested as a producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, well, maybe.  Let's see if we can think that out a little before Sunday.  Let's go to Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  What's up, guys?  Bear with me on this one for a second.  It might take a minute.  No, sorry.  I just want to point out, the FCC is so retarded that they are protecting us from hearing about 
[02:39:30]  a guy dumping 18 times.  But XM, on the other hand, has the poop goes the weasel, or some dumb monkey groans and  farts and shits 18 times.  It's just ironic.  It's a climate of fear, my friend.  The FCC has gotten radio stations and companies whipped up in such a frenzy that they are overcompensating  now.  But the pendulum swings both ways.  Believe me, you can tell right now, because we're working on FM, that the pendulum has slowly 
[02:40:00]  swung the other way.  Before you know it, I picture live sex acts with animals on FM radio.  I'm predicting that.  I'm like Kreskin.  You think chicken fucker?  Maybe we'll play that?  Oh, yeah.  Das gutt-chicken.  You've heard that, right, Colin?  What?  The chicken?  The German chicken fucker?  No.  Oh, God.  I love quizzing people on this.  You tell me the exact moment the chicken gets fucked. 
[02:40:30]  Oh.  He's holding the chicken for a while, and there's a woman there and a German man.  And he's holding the chicken.  And I guess they're romancing a little bit.  And then at one point, he sticks it in the chicken.  Now, you try to tell me, just by the sound, when this happens.  It sounds like a brick.  Macht das SpaÃŸ? 
[02:41:00]  Du HÃ¼hnerficker.  Ja.  Ja.  Ich bin ganz wild auf diese HÃ¤nde.  Ja.  Fister.  Ja.  Ja.  Ah, nun wird's gut.  Ja, gleich.  Ja.  Ja. 
[02:41:30]  That gets sadder and sadder every time I hear it.  I love how the chicken just goes from muck, muck, muck, muck, muck, to ahhh.  It's just going. 
[02:42:00]  Help me!  That's a chicken saying, please, oh God, why isn't anyone helping me?  Wow.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I love that in Germany.  How does your dick not get hard?  It's a delicacy.  Oh.  Now, doctor, could somebody get a chicken pregnant like a human?  I guess not, sir.  I guess not, sir.  It's physically impossible.  You sure?  Nah.  Yeah, the reproductive chromosomes don't equal out.  Different species.  You need 23 and 23 to make a 46. 
[02:42:30]  Not even an age from a monkey.  That makes a human.  If you get 23, and I believe a chicken has less than 23, it doesn't add up mathematically  and you don't get a baby.  That's even more impressive when you realize he went to fuckin' old Saybrook High School.  Now listen.  Old Saybrook.  Ladies and gentlemen.  It really is impressive.  The guy knows a little bit about everything.  I know.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Someone's bitchin' over here.  Eric in New Jersey.  Eric.  Good morning. 
[02:43:00]  Two things.  You guys weren't crappin' out on XM.  It just looked like technical difficulties.  And second thing.  Opie, you cheaped out again.  I saw Kenny walking in with a whole bunch of bills.  You didn't give away all the money.  I say the people that followed us ruined it.  We had our own people.  I was standing right outside the station in the Lexus, and I saw Kenny walking in with  a whole bunch of money.  Here's what happened.  The people that were following us, like some fans of the show, they were following, and  they were picking up all the money.  It was supposed to be share the wealth, like just all of a sudden some guy is walking 
[02:43:30]  to work and he sees a dollar bill flutter down in front of him and picks it up and feels  a little good.  We're down a dollar.  That's it.  Not supposed to be the same five guys that are following us down the sidewalk picking  up all the money.  Our stupid interns.  Kenny should have walked 50 feet in front of you.  Then we couldn't have seen it and described it.  We can't give warning, because the only reason those people were out in front this morning  was to pick up the money.  Well, our own guy was picking up money. 
[02:44:00]  Carrying a camera picking it up.  It might have been, I did hand it off to the guy with no teeth that was upstairs.  Okay.  So I didn't keep it.  He's a former child star.  One of our interns.  He sounds like, what's his name?  The Bronx cab driver.  You know what I mean?  No.  Big A?  Big A.  Yeah, he sounds like Big A.  He doesn't sound like Big A.  I don't think so.  What show are we on?  Former child star?  No.  He really wasn't.  He just looks like one.  He has that look.  Doesn't he have that look like the grown up child star that's having, falling on some hard 
[02:44:30]  times and picking up dollar bills off the sidewalk?  As he's supposed to be filming the whole thing.  Yeah.  He allows older gentlemen to rub scented oils on his body in the bathtub.  As he recites old dialogue from his TV show.  While they feed him my mind.  Scented bath salts.  Rub his young, steamy body.  Olden gentlemen.  Remember the episode when you were in school and you got in trouble? 
[02:45:00]  I was always such a fan of your work.  Thank you.  He's like Marky Mark in Boogie Nights when he's gonna let the guy blow.  Yeah.  $10 to blow me, $15 if you blow me while I'm doing the lines.  So you were picking up the dollar?  Well, he was either that or the car was gonna run over him.  Yeah.  It didn't matter.  The car runs him over.  It's my legal tender.  I didn't keep it though.  I handed it off to that guy with no teeth downstairs.  He needed more than I did. 
[02:45:30]  How about the fact that the other kid was running with the Norton's Carolines thing and I was  chasing him silently.  He knew what I was gonna do.  Oh, I know.  It would have been smashed.  We ran.  That kid burnt me so badly.  He helped you out there, Jimmy.  He's a good boy.  But let's say outrunning Colin is not exactly a fucking athletic beast.  It's not like it's an Olympic sport, right?  No.  Ben could outrun Colin carrying the Dillette machines.  Let's go to Nick the trucker.  Nick.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey.  I just want to tell you how you could solve that problem.  You could just throw the dollar bills out of the window at XM from the XM studios. 
[02:46:00]  That's what we'll do next time.  All right.  Good idea.  And all you have to worry about is Jim running after and trying to recoup some of the money  he isn't making like you two guys.  That's what we're gonna do now.  Oh, boy.  That's right, sir.  Good point.  You raise a good point, sir.  All right.  Let's go to Toss Salad.  Toss Salad, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I have a question for Dr. Ian Smith there.  I'm here.  I'm a very large gentleman, and I skimmed through your diet book there, and I'm a little concerned 
[02:46:30]  that that's almost too much of a cut of food for me to take to start losing weight, bro.  How big are you?  525.  Jesus.  Oh, my goodness.  So the next time you call and go, hello, Dr. Smith, I'm a fat embarrassment.  Right.  525?  You're right, Jimmy.  How old are you?  I am 29.  Whoa!  How do you get to 525 at 29, man?  Well, just eating a lot.  All right, listen.  Yeah, I mean, how else, you know? 
[02:47:00]  There's always a lot of pizzas.  Listen, listen, listen.  I work and shit, you know what I mean?  But I'm not acting.  That's all you're doing.  Listen, listen.  Stop moving.  Stop making excuses and listen.  Yeah.  You're 525.  Listen to somebody.  Okay, the first phase of the diet, you can eat as much as you want on it.  What are you talking about, you can't eat enough?  Okay.  Did you read?  It said you can eat as many fruits and vegetables as you want.  He ate that.  Yeah, Lady Di.  He ate the pages.  Lady Di.  No, man, I'm serious.  Come on, you're 525, you're going to die.  Yeah, I know that. 
[02:47:30]  I've finally come to that.  How old were you at 18?  I wanted to get some help.  It's quite a bedside manner you got there, doctor.  No, but I mean, come on.  You remind me of the fucking doctor in Hotel Rwanda.  The best part was that Ope just said, how old were you at 18?  All right, I'll be more...  I'll be more...  What's your name?  What's his name?  Jason.  Jason, I'll be more compassionate.  Listen, Jason.  It's a tough morning.  Jason, I'll be more compassionate.  Listen, just follow what the program says.  Don't make excuses.  You will drop tons of weight.  Do you understand?  Yes. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  He's like Gunnery Sergeant Smith.  What's your name, Fat Buddy?  525, Fat Buddy.  Send me an email.  You got Fat...  I was emailed yesterday.  Go to fatsmashediet.com and email me.  Okay.  Are you about to call me an asshole?  Hey, while we're on the subject of diets, I want to say, give a shout out to Chris Cooter  from Kansas.  I was in Kansas yesterday.  This guy...  I was listening to you guys on XM from Kansas driving around in Wichita.  Nice.  So Chris Cooter from Kansas Computer Connections loaned me his XM. 
[02:48:30]  What do you call it?  MyFi or something like that?  Yes.  He loaned it to me.  And your biggest fan in all of Kansas.  He's the morning air personality for 92.3 FM.  Manny Kalzinski.  Loves you guys.  We were doing an interview.  He must have said to you about a hundred times.  Yeah, look at that.  Real name Craig.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, guys?  No, I heard the biggest fan out there is the WBTK killer.  Which is just one serial killer.  Do you want to see that guy on TV?  Oh, yes.  That guy's 525 pounds. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, we got to work on him.  Well, the doctor wouldn't let him have it.  Hey, go to page...  What page is the 1,200 pound guy in?  Well...  Who's that?  It should have been on the front page of the page.  It's the fattest guy on record.  Wowee.  1,200 pounds.  Let me see that one.  No, that's Moussaoui.  Let me see that.  Find that for him.  He's having an intestinal transplant over in Italy.  He's a...  He is?  1,200 pounds.  1,200 pound Mexican.  He's going to go to Italy to have an intestinal transplant. 
[02:49:30]  All Mexican should be that heavy.  They'd never get through the border.  Wait, what's an intestinal transplant?  What they're going to do is they're going to try to reduce the amount of time.  Look!  Look!  There he is.  Fattfuck...  Size matters.  Nice.  2 of them.  2 of them.  When do you see the husband?  When do you see the husband?  He's on MSNBC and it says size matters.  Look at that pet.  Look at what she weighs.  6...  680.  No.  Even the scales at my own doctor's office don't go up high enough to weigh me, so therefore  I have to go out and buy a special scale that weighs up to 500 pounds. 
[02:50:00]  Aw.  She's not alone.  The Centers for Disease Control reports 61% of American women are now overweight.  Yeah, but she's like 80% or so.  The number is even higher for men at 71%.  Millions with special needs.  Websites like supersizeworld.com are filling them and sales are soaring.  There's a lot of opportunity here for people to make money providing products to overweight  people.  Yeah.  It's not a passing fad.  It's a real trend.  Even six feet under.  Keith Davis used to be the only seller of oversized coffins. 
[02:50:30]  I love it.  That's a good idea.  The result, doctors say, of a nation coming to terms with its size.  Look at the size of that thing.  I do think the attitudes are changing in large part because two-thirds of us are overweight  or obese.  And because people are getting so large they don't fit comfortably into the car.  It's like a jacuzzi.  Yeah.  You pop the top.  Look at her.  Look at her.  That looks like Bob Kelly in a wig.  Look at her fat hands.  Today, I am a fat person.  Dude. 
[02:51:00]  Today, I would like to be comfortably accommodated.  Go fuck yourself.  Jack Kelly in NBC News, Chicago.  She's pissed that she can't just walk in anywhere and buy shit.  She's right.  Exactly.  How do you think we feel about, we can't walk into a barn and just eat?  Can you believe they're going to make all this money off these people rather than tell  them to lose some weight and save their lives?  Yeah.  They're going to make all this money selling them, I don't know.  I like it.  I got a problem with that philosophical.  I don't just fucking make them buy two seats on the airplane.  You fat skunk.  You got to buy two.  End of discussion.  No.  Southwest did.  I love it. 
[02:51:30]  And they caught hell for it.  But they were right.  Yeah, they were.  You fucking fat embarrassment.  Oh, stop it.  Good point, doctor.  People have a problem.  Exactly.  We're trying to help them lose weight here.  The O and A show is going to be known as trying to save America.  Yeah.  See?  We don't want to save anybody.  Listen to me.  I don't mind fat people.  I don't mind fat people.  I've fucked a few fat girls once in a while.  Oh, me too.  Who hasn't?  I once fucked a fat girl in a hammock and we fell off and I almost broke my cock.  I swear to God.  This was years back.  Years ago. 
[02:52:00]  I just don't like when they want the rest of us to bend over.  Oh, come on.  That's the only problem I have.  The doctor is trying to help fat people and you're sitting here.  You criticize them and they want to eat more.  I know how it is.  I tend to have a weight problem myself.  Do you?  Yeah.  That woman was delusional like Lady Di.  She's got a good point.  She, instead of losing weight and saving her life, wants the world to accommodate her fatness.  Right.  Why not?  Then it makes her look skinnier.  Smack her in the head and go, you're fat, lose the weight, and then you'll fit into this 
[02:52:30]  world.  That's right.  Yeah.  We're making effort.  I had to quit drinking and doing drugs.  Well, then you can quit fucking shoving devil dogs into your face whenever you're frightened.  Devil dogs are great.  They certainly are.  You know what my favorite is?  They're too cakey, though.  Yeah, you're right.  The Yankee Doodles.  Yankee Doodles are good.  Sonny Doodles are good, too.  Ah, Sonny Doodles are for cocksuckers.  I need this song.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  Colin Quinn in studio playing Caroline's all weekend long.  I'm getting the hell out of here.  What's that? 
[02:53:00]  You're leaving.  You're going.  Billy Connolly coming in.  I don't want to stick around.  Well, he's not here yet.  All right.  Then I'll wait until Billy Connolly comes.  Susie.  Susie shows up.  Well, I'll stay as long as I need to.  Oh, that's Reagan.  Yeah.  If you close your eyes, you'd think it was the real person.  Caroline's with Colin Quinn all weekend long, okay?  Thanks, Hope.  The numbers, I don't know.  Somebody has to be mature around here.  212-757-4100.  Hi.  I love listening to Opie and Anthony when I'm having a tubby.  I get clean, I laugh at the funny jokes, and I play with my submarines. 
[02:53:30]  Sometimes Uncle Henry gets in the tub with me.  He makes me play with his submarine.  I'm happy play.  You'll still go to hell, sir. 
[02:54:00]  You'll still go to hell.  Our country stinks.  Let's just give up on the death penalty.  Yeah, if we're not going to use it, you know, a little more generously.  Why make us feel good like it might happen?  You know, if they're not going to do it.  If anyone deserves the death penalty, it's this Moussaoui ass.  I know.  And I don't want to call him an ass, but that kind of language I think is...  I think you're right.  It's XM.  We can use that.  Yeah. 
[02:54:30]  And then the New York Post.  Hell can wait.  Ugh.  They're the worst.  I think people should stop even talking about this guy.  Just like, make believe he doesn't exist.  Moussaoui to rot in prison.  The more you just...  Like he's nothing.  We need to talk about him because it shows what America's all about.  Why do...  Why mercy?  We're dummies.  And that's what it is.  It's mercy.  The nation of...  Either they're afraid he'll become a martyr and there's going to be a backlash.  Let him be a martyr.  I'm just telling you.  They're afraid of his law.  Let him be a martyr.  I think this is a better punishment. 
[02:55:00]  No.  I do.  They don't rot in solitary confinement.  But that's fine.  This guy's come from nothing.  He's just an animal.  He doesn't...  And now he's going to get dinner.  He's going to be able to work out.  He's going to be able to...  He can work out.  Yeah, he can.  They work out.  For that hour a day he's allowed out.  Walk outside.  I think Jimmy's right.  I think if you kill the guy, he becomes a martyr and then all of a sudden you got like...  Now all of a sudden he becomes this big deal.  Like because he... 
[02:55:30]  You know, he died for the cause.  I don't know.  No, but the whole...  These guys don't care.  You know what I mean?  They don't respect us for doing that.  They laugh at us.  I know.  He literally laughed.  He laughed.  Faggot country.  I laugh at you.  Dead soldiers.  And then you have this stupid Iranian like...  Everybody in there is going, well, you know, I mean, it's not a war of religions and Iranian  guys.  I kill you Jews and Catholic.  But it's like we're being so phony.  All about religion.  Come on, let's just get it on.  Look.  Who's that?  He's made charge extra for overweight.  Good. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, look at that.  That's disgraceful.  Brand new news story.  Wow.  Overweight.  This weight thing is getting crazy.  Yeah.  I just think they should have put this guy to death.  Oh, they should have tortured him.  Their family now has to sit there and know that he's going to...  But even then, they had all those 9-11 victims coming on and going, I hope he doesn't  die.  It perpetuates the man.  And he's like, I'll kill you.  Yeah.  I'll kill you.  It's so phony, man.  We just live as if there's this higher ideology that nobody should believe in. 
[02:56:30]  No.  Kill all these motherfuckers, man.  Fuck that.  Well, you can think that way, but I happen to think there's a higher thing.  Really?  What is it?  The breathing apparatus?  Yeah.  Breathe right strip.  You should have your own cult with that breathing strip.  Oh, this is a good question for Dr. Ian Smith Cooper from Illinois.  What's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing today?  What do you say, Coop?  Nothing much, but I got a quick question for Dr. Ian if possible.  I've lost a little bit of weight here recently, but I still have some fat and meaty tits and 
[02:57:00]  I can't seem to get rid of them.  And I'm just wondering if any suggestions as to how to actually try to get rid of my tits?  Man tits, good question.  How much did you weigh before?  How much do I weigh or did I weigh?  Did you weigh when you started?  About 230 I'd say.  And how much have you lost?  I'm about down to 185.  Whoa!  And you still have them?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what you got to do?  You got to see a plastic surgeon.  You probably have like male gynecomastia. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, the man tits.  The man tits.  Oh, Billy!  There's no way to actually, I mean you can't spot reduce when you lose weight.  So you can't just reduce your chest.  So you need to, you know.  God help.  What's it called to you?  Male gynecomastia.  I think I have that.  Let's see, Jimmy.  Let's see.  You do not.  I have gynecomastia.  You do not.  Get out of here.  Let's see, Jimmy.  He's a doctor.  You liar.  He's a doctor.  Let's see. 
[02:58:00]  Well, thank you, doctor.  All right, man.  Go check with a plastic surgeon.  Good luck to you, sir.  Not a bad deal.  Thanks, guys.  I'm back.  No.  You don't even have a hint of a muscle up there.  You don't have nothing.  Aren't you working out?  Yeah, but you do some press ups and that gets rid of it.  I've been, I've been, I have, I don't do, I do very light things just to build a little  bit of muscle down there.  It's fine to get a chest there.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Not much.  You're fine.  He doesn't have what?  What is it again?  Male gynecomastia.  Male gynecomastia.  I don't want gynecomastia.  There was a neighbor next door to me when I used to live in East Islip and the father, 
[02:58:30]  I know, East Islip, the father had that and he had no problem going out and cutting  the grass without his shirt on and he had tits.  They were real tits.  No, it's called...  Male gynecomastia.  Male gynecomastia.  Male gynecomastia.  Male gynecomastia.  Male gynecomastia.  Like Meatloaf in the fight club.  We should ask Edward Norton if meatloaf really had male gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia.  Uneducated.  And President Bush pronouncing gynecomastia.  Is it gyneco or gyne-cla? 
[02:59:00]  No L.  No, I didn't think so.  Gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia.  Gynecomastia would be silly.  Yeah, we all know that.  Male gynecomastia.  You're the only one that doesn't know that.  Anyway, back to the father.  Yeah, and he used to push the lawnmower around.  And he had, like, and they weren't even, like, big, full, nice ones.  He had, like, these banana tits.  That could be a good look, though, too.  He'd push her.  Not on him.  Did he have big areolas?  It's a good look if you're a lot.  Yeah.  That's a big word.  Yeah, Patty's cleavage looked pretty good today.  Me and Jim were noticing what she was doing.  Right? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.  She's showing a little cleavage.  I'd like to titty fuck her, but backwards where you put your ass on her face.  Oh, that way.  Oh, my goodness.  He looked out at those hammer toes where you're fucking plowing away.  Talons.  All right, Tim, what's up?  Hey, Dr. Ian.  I got a question.  Back in 99, I had the gastro bypass.  I did really good.  Got down. 
[03:00:00]  I was 700 pounds.  Got down to 180.  Did good for, like, five years.  All of a sudden, the life left me.  I started drinking, started eating more, stretched my stomach out, and now I'm back up to 400 pounds again.  I don't know if I should.  Before you guys smash me, I know I'm a fat, worthless piece of shit.  Oh, come on, dude.  Don't say that.  Come on, man.  Don't say that, dude, just because we're thinking it.  I mean, I've got a real nice girlfriend now, sweetheart, but I've noticed since I started putting on the weight again, it's getting less and less where I think she's finding me attractives. 
[03:00:30]  Hey, dude, do you go to, you ever hear of Overeaters Anonymous?  Did you ever, like, try taking care of the mental, like, or the spiritual side of it and, like, not just getting your stomach stapled?  I try, yeah.  I went, saw a psychiatrist for a year before, and, like I said, I don't know what to do.  I'm just, I know I'm going to die if I don't lose the weight. 
[03:01:00]  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Dude, first of all, you've got to do whatever the doctors say to do, but try O-A.  All right.  Not a psychiatrist.  O-A.  Because Colin bashed me for not being a compassionate doctor.  I'm going to be compassionate here.  Okay.  I mean, do you, I mean.  Because you are a disgusting fat body, private pile.  Like I said, I drive chalk, you know, and I just, dear diet that you have, I haven't got the book yet because, fortunately, I live in a small town and the only store we have is a big Walmart. 
[03:01:30]  They don't carry your book.  But this is what I, I told you guys, email me, go to fatsmasheddiet.com.  The top 75 people were giving away free books today.  Last time I came here, I got beat up because I brought four books.  So now I bring 75 books and you guys aren't emailing me.  Fatsmasheddiet.com.  Sir, you said you're a truck driver.  What do you call yourself?  Yeah, some days that's how I feel.  Like I said, you guys don't have to smash me.  I already feel smashed. 
[03:02:00]  All right, email me, okay?  And if you're top 75, you get the book.  Otherwise, it's only eight bucks on Amazon.  My goodness.  Now lean forward and joke yourself.  It's not the price.  I don't have a credit card.  But I'll do that.  He's hauling ping pong balls and he still can't get past the weigh stations.  Your ass looks like about 150 pounds of juice bubblegum.  Okay, Dr. Ian, I'll just get on that Amazon.com.  It's eight bucks on Amazon.  If you're top 75, email me at fatsmashediet.com. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  I want to go see you guys.  You all have a good day now.  You little scumbag.  I got your name.  I got your ass.  Hey, good luck, man.  Give my best to St. Peter.  Why, you little maggot.  You make me want to vomit.  How many Krispy Kremes is eight bucks, Doctor?  Let's go to Doug in Arkansas.  Doug.  Doug.  Yeah.  Let her rip.  You're on the air.  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  I wonder how come that Mosali character even gets a civil trial in the United States. 
[03:03:00]  He's not even a legal citizen.  And then the people that want to give all the immigrants amnesty, that's what they're talking about.  That's the type of person they're wanting to give amnesty to.  What the fuck?  Well, sir, in fairness, as much as I disagree with the position on the immigrants, I don't  think that they're referring to hijackers from 9-11.  Yeah.  As much as I dislike their completely left-wing ideology, I got to disagree with you on that.  And I think that people from other countries do get fair trials here in the United States 
[03:03:30]  when...  No, he doesn't.  Not when he helped conspire to commit a crime against the way of life we believe in.  What does the Constitution say we're supposed to do, then?  He has to get the trial.  So what are we supposed to do with him?  He was found guilty.  Treat him as an enemy combatant.  This guy's right.  He has to get the trial where they take you out when they find you guilty and cut your  fucking head off.  You're right, boy.  This is America, man.  What are you talking about?  Holy cow.  I agree with that kid.  Now I see why Bush is in office.  Come on, dude.  That kid's right. 
[03:04:00]  He's not, Kyle.  He wants to follow the Islamic belief and the Islamic...  Sharia law.  He's right.  We're not...  We're not in Islam.  ...trial by Americans with his beliefs that he chose to believe in, and when our fucking  people, our jurors that are selected find him guilty, we're fighting for his civil rights  for two years...  That's right.  ...before he even got a trial.  Before he even got a trial, we fought for his civil rights for two years.  Yeah, but, Doug, Doug, Doug, okay, okay, okay.  ...that he didn't even want. 
[03:04:30]  You're wrong, sir.  No, he's not.  He's right.  We should beat him to death with a Koran.  No, sir.  You don't understand.  Roe v. Wade changed everything, because if you're not read your Miranda rights, that's  totally a violation.  That's why there's amendments.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What an ass.  ...before he ever got a trial, lawyers fought for his civil rights...  That's right.  ...to make sure that he got a fair trial that he didn't even want.  Thank goodness.  ...he didn't even want it.  But, sir, you got to admit one thing, though. 
[03:05:00]  Freedom of speech is an important issue, and you can't yell fire in a crowded movie house.  Shut up, Norton House.  I'm trying to talk Constitution with this guy.  Shut up.  You're making me sound silly.  All right, Doug, thank you.  The guy's right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye, Doug.  Get home safe.  Hey, Paul the trucker.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, Dr. Ian.  Yo, what's up, man?  I can't get on the internet while I'm driving down the road, and all you give is your website.  If you give me your email, I can email you from my phone and get one of your books. 
[03:05:30]  I can't give my email out like that.  Yes, sir.  See, the whole purpose of you guys going to the website is so that you can read through  us to understand what it is all about.  Yeah, go to the website.  That's the purpose.  Go to the website so you can read what it's about, and then you take the next step.  That's the whole idea.  This is Weasel in North Carolina.  Weasel.  Hey, I'm glad Miss Sally got life, because they're going to domer his ass once he goes  to jail.  Yeah, that never happens either.  They're not.  He's going to end up recruiting half of that place.  That never happens either.  I wish it was true.  He's going to be a hero in there with all the Muslims in prison. 
[03:06:00]  Hero.  Then the white Aryans will get his ass.  Nah, they don't represent him.  He's in confinement for 23 hours.  He goes outside for one hour.  He doesn't see anybody.  This guy's not going to see anybody.  So what?  They got that priest.  They got the molesting priest.  He was in confinement for 23 hours.  All of a sudden, someone looks the other way.  Sure.  Who's looking?  They did kill him, right?  Allah willing.  Yeah.  Allah willing.  The top 10 greatest metal songs of all time.  Did Black Sabbath make the list? 
[03:06:30]  They better have.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What is it?  What is it again?  Top 10 greatest metal songs of all time.  They should all be Sabbath.  No.  James Brown.  According to Jimmy.  No, there's other good metal songs in there.  Oh.  You got to have a Zeppelin song in there.  Probably.  They're not really metal, but.  Nah, Zeppelin's not like metal.  No, Zeppelin.  They're not really metal.  All right.  How about James Brown?  Yes.  James Brown, yes.  Please, please, please.  Let's see.  All-time metal.  So you got to go.  Paranoid is number one.  But then newer school.  Paranoid? 
[03:07:00]  No.  Yeah?  You think?  I don't know.  What's that song by your, you know?  I don't know.  I mean, man.  Crazy Train should be in there, but it won't be.  Are there any 80s metal?  Crazy.  A lot of 80s.  Yeah, Metallica's got to be in there.  It's just about all 80s.  Metallica, Whitesnake.  Any Whitesnake?  No Whitesnake.  No.  All 80s except two from the 70s.  Let me guess Metallica.  Metallica.  Hopefully, they didn't put Enter Sandman.  Please, Tom, they didn't do that.  No.  Okay.  Four Horsemen, I would put. 
[03:07:30]  No.  Pantera?  No Pantera.  What Metallica song?  I'm not saying.  We're going to do a little list here.  Primus.  We're going to do a little thing.  Primus.  Heavy metal.  Top 10 greatest metal songs of all time.  Number 10.  Number 10.  Motorhead.  Ace of Spades.  Ace of Spades.  That's right.  You've got to let us guess before you put the music up.  Totally influenced right here by Black Sabbath.  Fantastic.  If you like to gamble, I tell you how to land. 
[03:08:00]  You win some, lose some, and do the same to me.  The pleasure is to play.  I feel like I'm just watching.  What an animal.  With those sugar pops on his face.  I'm a shade green.  The only gun I need is the Ace of Spades.  Ace of Spades.  All right.  There you go.  Number 10.  10 greatest metal songs of all time.  Greatest.  Number nine has got to be Kingdom Come. 
[03:08:30]  What's that?  I remember that band.  What was their big hit?  I can't remember anymore.  I played it on the radio back in Rochester.  And King's X.  King's X, sure.  Number nine is an Aussie song.  Paranoid.  I'm going to guess Crazy Train.  Anyone else?  An Aussie song.  Iron Man.  Heavy Metal.  Actually, if someone guesses, we should just stop there.  Yes.  Crazy Train in ninth place.  Oh.  All in blood.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, Christ.  I have enough of that.  This one enough.  Enough of that.  How many frigging times are you going to play it?  Crazy.  All right.  All right.  Top 10 greatest classic rock.  Shut up.  Living is full.  Top 10.  Horrible.  Greatest metal songs of all time.  Who's calling?  Who's calling?  Is that Aussie?  Who's calling?  I'm being called.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I think I hear me. 
[03:09:30]  Someone's playing my show through the phone.  It's God.  They're playing this break.  Do you think this shit is entertaining?  All right.  Time to change my cell phone.  I have no idea who's doing this.  It's probably an accident, actually.  Great.  Who did this story?  Now I'm saying hello.  Hello.  This is great.  It's a big loop.  Maybe you're dead.  It's true.  Number eight is White Zombie.  Number eight is a Slayer song. 
[03:10:00]  Slayer?  Hello, it's...  I don't know Slayer at all, to be honest with you.  Any Slayer fans?  No.  No.  In eighth place, Raining Blood from Slayer.  Oh, for heaven's sakes.  That kind of...  Metallica right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Double leads.  An old school.  Listen to that double bass.  The old double bass drum.  Drum is going mad. 
[03:10:30]  Both feet.  No one uses the double bass anymore, do they?  Nope.  Anyone?  That machine gun.  That's pretty hardcore.  Fucking savagism.  Yeah.  I like that.  Slayer, Raining Blood.  In eighth place, top ten greatest metal songs of all time. 
[03:11:00]  We've got to go...  Scorpions.  Scorps.  We've got to go...  Yeah, rocky like a hurricane.  We've got to go to Patrick in Arkansas.  Patrick?  Hey, it's Patrick.  Listen, please ban all calls from Arkansas.  I just moved here about a year ago, and there's nothing good that anybody can contribute out of the state.  Just like that jackass a couple minutes ago.  Really?  You want to ban your state.  Well, usually Alabama disappoints us.  No, no, no.  I grew up in Jersey.  Please just ban any calls from Arkansas. 
[03:11:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, Arkansas not doing a good job lately.  Let's say hi to Heather in Jersey.  Heather.  Hi, how are you guys doing?  Hi, Heather.  I had a question for Dr. Ian.  Phase one.  I don't think I'm getting enough protein.  I've been on the phase one for four days.  Good.  And I wanted to know what your opinion was on veggie burgers and protein supplements.  Veggie burgers are fine, number one.  Okay?  Okay.  They've got to be completely meatless veggie burgers. 
[03:12:00]  Number two, you've got protein from chickpeas.  You've got beans.  You've got tofu.  All kinds of lentils.  You've got tons of protein.  You don't eat that stuff?  Well, I eat the beans, but I'm not a big fan of the tofu.  Or lentil.  Do you have somebody to grab your ears?  Protein injection.  But as far as supplements, in all honesty, you've got to be careful with supplements.  There's a lot of other stuff other than protein, depending on the type.  There are a thousand brands out there.  So I tell people, listen, if you're going to have some protein, make sure it's the right type, low calories, and doesn't have all that other gunk in there. 
[03:12:30]  Okay.  So you can eat meatless veggie burgers in phase one?  Yes, meatless veggie burgers.  Those are good, actually.  Yeah.  All right.  So the next time you guys see Nurse Heather, I'll be a skinny hot bitch.  Oh, I know who you are from PalTalk.  Of course.  Good luck, Heather.  Send us your picture.  Thanks, guys.  The girls are battling on PalTalk this morning, by the way.  About what?  They're all out-flashing, out-assing each other, showing each other their asses.  Are they fighting for my love? 
[03:13:00]  Um, no.  But I want to date someone.  All right.  I'm lonely.  Top 10 greatest metal songs of all time.  Seventh place.  Primus.  Primus.  I'm going to say London Quire Boys.  Metallica.  Iron Maiden.  Iron Maiden.  All right.  Probably, uh...  Their big hit.  Run to the Hills?  Hurry up, Ted Holt.  I don't think it's going to be Run to the Hills.  Yeah.  Run to the Hills.  No, I don't think so.  I'm hoping they go at Running Free.  It's a better song. 
[03:13:30]  They probably won't.  How about the Hills Have Eyes based on your look?  Go ahead.  What is it?  Ouch.  That really hurt.  That was kind of hurtful.  We're supposed to be having fun here.  And not funny, but go ahead.  Inappropriate.  Unnecessary.  It really was.  We're taking back one of your Caroline's plugs now.  That's right.  That's what we do.  Doc of a Caroline plug.  Colin will not be at Caroline's this weekend.  That's right.  You can't go there by calling 212-757-4100.  You're not going to see him there.  Seventh place, Iron Maiden.  The number of the beasts.  I was going to say that. 
[03:14:00]  From 1982.  Right.  I lived alone.  My mind was blank.  I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind.  What did I see?  Can I believe?  That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy.  Just what I saw in my old dreams were the reflections of my walkman staring back at me. 
[03:14:30]  Cause in my dreams, trust me, it's all the way to be the place that twists my mind and brings me to despair.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Makes me want to do cocaine. 
[03:15:00]  Sounds like a show tune.  Does that scare you, Ian?  No.  Nah, man.  I'm from Connecticut.  I'm from Danbury, Connecticut.  Did you listen to metal growing up?  I listened to everything.  You know, I was into, I don't know what you call it, but like air supply and journey.  Gay.  The police.  I listen to those guys.  But just say no homo, please.  No homo.  No homo.  No homo.  It's okay, then.  I heard Bruce Dickinson mention the guys on his radio show.  Really?  What did he say?  I guess that you were back or something like that.  I don't know the content. 
[03:15:30]  Ooh.  I've interviewed him a bunch over the years.  I also heard that that big bulge we used to see in those posters in the 80s was real.  Someone I know pulled a train with him and it says cock is huge.  Pulled a train with him?  Hey, let's go to Jim the trucker.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, I was just wondering if we're going to be blessed with more of the EROC radio network  today.  Boy, did that not work out well.  Why not?  I thought it was done fine.  Heard a bunch of complaints.  I thought it was great.  I love hearing all the behind the scenes cut down between the interns. 
[03:16:00]  It's awesome.  You know, we've got to explain something because we're getting trashed on our fan sites.  A few people on the fan sites.  Which just amazes me.  This deal we made recently is a great deal for everybody in the end when we figure it  all out.  Hold on.  Guys, I'm leaving your boys in.  I say number six is Glenn Danzig featuring Tia Carrera.  Thanks for having me on.  It's been a pleasure.  Thank you, Mr. Quinn.  Take it easy.  Jim, I'd say I'm sorry about that thing I did to you shit, but I'm really not, so it'll  be a lie.  I'm just glad you're leaving for a more famous person. 
[03:16:30]  Thank you, Colin.  We're better dealing, Colin.  All right, hold on.  Thank you for taking my call, fellas.  Hold on, hold on, man, Jim.  Okay, okay.  We're doing a few different things here.  Colin, we'll see you at Caroline's this weekend.  All right, thanks.  It's not all the listeners, and it's not all the people from Message Board.  You know what happens?  Elo has been sending these emails because he's Elo.  And, you know, he gets complaints because people have his email address, and he forwards  them to us, and it's fine.  I read them.  I take them for what they're worth. 
[03:17:00]  Sometimes they're valid.  Sometimes they're not.  And last night he sent one that just set me off.  It was some douchebag who wrote about how we are putting E-Rock in there at a quarter  after 11 to play more best of crap so we can do as little work as possible.  And this is, I got this email when I'm drag-assing around the house from doing five and a half  hours of fucking radio.  I'm ready to fall asleep when I get home, and this guy, this asshole fucking listener 
[03:17:30]  is telling me I'm not working hard enough.  Blow me.  What was his name?  I want his name.  Because he signed the goddamn thing.  I'm looking for it right now.  I'll punch up my own email right now.  I don't care how long it takes.  I'm looking for it because I want to read it to everybody because you are angry.  You are angry.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  Here we go.  My email is coming up.  I just hope they expand.  You guys should let the boys expand their role. 
[03:18:00]  I think it's great to hear them chattering back and forth.  This is in its infancy, my friend.  This is something that's never, and not like other people say it, this is something that  really has never been done in radio.  So it's going to take a little bit, not long, just to work things out.  That's all.  Well, here it is.  Here it is.  Kevin Huxford.  That's right.  His name alone annoys me.  I'm Kevin Huxford. 
[03:18:30]  Huxford.  You and the boys have sacrificed the show to make some money off of Free FM, apparently  to spread the word of XM to the people that wouldn't sign up for Howard when he left.  The show is taking its hits creatively during the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and the commercials  are ridiculous.  You're not doing much to make it easier for the fans.  I'm hearing more XM bits, Ramon bits, wow tutorials, and listen to the soothing sounds  of Percy Faith commo crap to fill time.  You're messing with the replay schedule where you don't have the online version and the 
[03:19:00]  satellite version synced up.  So I heard a re-air of FM Tuesday from 3 to 6 and then heard it again in my car from  6 to 9.  When you did it on Monday, it was on XM from 3 to 6 in both places.  It's like he's annoyed at the replay schedule, which, believe me, so am I.  We're working that out.  Again, work in progress.  And then he writes this.  Now as a capper, a capper, like this is something we've been doing.  We've been doing this a week so far, my friend. 
[03:19:30]  As a capper, they have E-Rock going from 11.15 to noon in some effort to somehow satisfy  XM's desire that the show go to 12 p.m. whenever possible without them actually putting an ounce  of extra work in.  They essentially have him hosting a live and incredibly lame worst of show.  I'm going to cancel one of my units and send the corresponding roadie 2 to your attention  at XM, sir.  Thanks for screwing up one of my joys of my day. 
[03:20:00]  Regards, Kevin Fuxford.  Kevin Huxford.  Talk about when I read that line that said without them putting in an ounce of extra work,  I went from doing, you know, the minimal amount of radio that most radio jocks do to doing  almost six hours of radio a day in some cases, usually five and a half.  Well, we made the mistake of telling everyone that the channel's going to be live till noon.  Live till noon.  That doesn't mean we're doing radio till noon, asshole.  And we've been doing it till 11.30. 
[03:20:30]  We could leave at 11 still.  And you know something?  Today, I'm fucking out of here at 11.  And you know who to blame it on?  Kevin fucking Huxford.  That's why I'm leaving at 11.  That's why everyone else is not getting O&A Live after 11 o'clock today.  I'm out.  You want to bitch at him?  Email him.  KHUXFORD2.  It's the number two.  Don't spell it out.  KHUXFORD2 at Yahoo.com.  Can I read?  You could then bitch at him why we're not on after 11 and one second today. 
[03:21:00]  See, we made the mistake because the reality is XM told us we could still go to 11.  Yeah.  We decided that we should give a little extra.  We decided.  You know something?  Because a lot of people are like frustrated and pissed off as we try to figure this whole  thing out.  So we're like, you know, we'll combat that by staying on the air as long as we possibly  can.  The reality is we can leave every day at 11.  That is our deal.  But we were stupid enough to say that we'll keep the channel on till noon and play in  some Worst Of and maybe throw some other guys on. 
[03:21:30]  But the reality is we can leave every day at 11.  We didn't sign a new deal where...  Where we have to go to 12?  No.  We could be out of here at 11 every day.  And today, 11.  Here's the beauty of Anthony.  Here's the email that Anthony wrote to this guy.  Oh, oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Well, I didn't write it to him because I didn't want him having my email address.  Oh, you wrote it?  I wrote it to you and Eric Logan.  Well, can I read this?  Sure.  It's Eric Logan from Anthony Cumia. 
[03:22:00]  You know, I know some people are pissed and this guy may have his points, but when I read  this crap, I wanted to hit the asshole.  And then you have in the cap, you know, you...  I quoted his statement.  Thank you.  And his quote once again.  Now, as a capper, they have EROC going from 11.15 to 12 in some effort to somehow satisfy  XM's desire that the show go to 12 whenever possible without them actually putting in  an ounce of extra work.  Back to Anthony's email.  Now, for the past week in capital letters, we've been on live till at least 11.30.  I think in reality it's been closer to 11.45. 
[03:22:30]  This prick picks out the one day so far that we signed off at 11.15 to add this, add that  to his little bitch fest.  Five and a half hours of radio and this little fucking cunt says, without them actually putting  in an ounce of extra work, fuck Kevin Huxford.  That was my email to my boss.  With the word cunt and fuck.  In there.  Just so he knows how I felt about the whole thing.  The channel stays live until noon. 
[03:23:00]  Some days we'll go to noon.  Some days, you know what?  Some days like today?  11.  Some days we're going to leave right at 11.  Kevin Huxford.  Kay Huxford, number two, just two, at yahoo.com if you want to maybe fill him in on why you  guys aren't getting any extra live radio after 11 o'clock today.  I'll bet you he gets an email.  And let me tell you something.  I have nothing to do today.  I have no meetings.  I have no nothing.  We could stay on till noon today.  Nope.  Sorry.  Because of Kevin Huxford. 
[03:23:30]  Good old Kevin.  I had some funny shit planned too.  Remember that 11 o'clock thing we were going to do?  Oh, God.  It was really good.  And we probably can't do it.  It's so time sensitive.  We're not even going to be able to do it the next day.  We really did take it upon ourselves to do extra radio because we know everyone's a  little confused right now.  No one told us to do that.  We were just staying here as long as we can.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to ban someone from pal talk right now because I'm so angry.  I know they have nothing to do with what happened, but just for the hell of it, I'm going 
[03:24:00]  to scroll down.  Boom.  This guy right here.  And there.  He's gone.  He's gone because someone had to pay.  Someone needed to take one in the back of the head.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Hey, you know what?  That was so much fun.  Two of yous go.  There you go.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  Make it a biggie, Ant.  Make it a biggie.  Don't ban a chick, but how about you find the chick with the biggest tits and kick her 
[03:24:30]  out of the room?  Yeah.  You got a big one?  All right.  Biggest tits, booze out of the room.  Ban the hottest girl.  Yeah.  Just throw her out.  Thanks to Kevin Huxford.  Here's blame this on Kevin Huxford.  There she goes.  Postal wife.  It's gone.  She's been showing her tits the whole show.  Bye-bye.  That is because of Kevin Huxford.  She's not banned, is she?  Yes.  Let's get out.  Gone.  Gone.  But I like her tits.  What's up, Al?  That Kevin dude, I hate to say, is right. 
[03:25:00]  And if you'll give me a minute, I'll let you know.  First of all, what's your email address?  You got people who really enjoy your show.  Uh-huh.  Who look forward to it.  This is more!  I've been one of the biggest tits game with XM.  All right.  People wanting more.  That's our new theory.  See, I enjoy listening to people's comments.  Go ahead, Al.  You do three hours in the morning, and then you're like, well, I'll do two hours on XM now.  And you say, well, we're tired.  We're going to go home.  Fuck y'all.  You got people up there pissed because of that. 
[03:25:30]  Do you realize, do you realize in the past week we have not done two hours on XM?  We have done two and a half or two hours and 45 minutes?  Do you realize that in the past week every day?  What?  What?  We used to four.  Hold on.  We still do...  You got to look at this as a...  Oh, my God.  It's still a radio show.  Before we made the deal with CBS, we were doing four hours of radio a day.  Now we're doing five and a half hours a day on average, okay?  And I'll even be fair.  In the first three hours, there's a bunch of commercials, obviously. 
[03:26:00]  And it comes out to about 45 minutes of commercial.  Uh-huh.  So you can even take that out, and we're still doing another hour of radio a day.  We're still doing an extra hour of fucking radio.  It's still like two shows because it's the content.  You guys are so relieved and so undistracted when you do the XM because you can't curse.  You don't have that...  No, no, no.  It's because we've been here for 18 months, you idiot.  We've been at the other job for a week.  We're fans.  We're getting more comfortable over there.  It's only been a week.  You guys are giving these guys too much credence. 
[03:26:30]  You got hardcore fans that just feel like they're being left out.  Al, are you a trucker?  Yes, I am.  Could you find a cement abutment, find a concrete abutment, and press that gas pedal as hard  as you can, and please steer into it.  I hope you jackknife into a lake of AIDS.  We used to do four hours of radio.  Now we're doing about...  No, no, but I will come to your house for a fee and shit on you.  Thank you, Al. 
[03:27:00]  You didn't like the Edward Norton call today, you dope.  I can't believe some of these people.  The guests are getting better.  Look, we got Billy Connolly in studio.  Billy Connolly, I am so sorry you had to sit here and listen to my tarot.  Our guests are getting...  It's like show business.  It's like snow business, I know.  Everything about it is a cluttered funk.  God.  It's wonderful radio.  The fans.  In the end, we're doing at least an hour of radio a day more. 
[03:27:30]  At least.  And keeping the channel open until noon so then they can play stuff that a lot of people  out there haven't heard yet.  You try to satisfy.  You try.  Believe me, we are trying to satisfy.  We could have signed a deal and done less radio.  We really are trying to do this in a way that makes the listeners happy and it's a growing  process.  We've been there over at FM for a week.  Give it some time.  There are these impatient little whiny bitches and they can't understand that it's a change 
[03:28:00]  and it will gradually work out.  Don't worry so much.  We know what we're doing.  But they don't know what to do when you go off the air.  You see, they're just hanging there.  What do I do?  Yeah, I took 12.  What am I going to do?  But you said.  You promised.  I can't masturbate for that long.  It sounds like Andy.  I love it.  I'm closing my eyes and I see Andy.  They don't know what to do.  That's the problem with programs, you see. 
[03:28:30]  But you did half an hour less.  It's left them hanging there.  Yeah, they see us, if we go off at 11.30, as doing a half hour less because we didn't  go to noon.  Meanwhile, the noon thing is a courtesy.  So we gave you a half hour more.  But they don't see it that way.  It's a courtesy.  Give me a break.  It's a fucking courtesy.  Huxtable, whatever the hell your name is.  Kevin Huxley.  I don't know what's the matter.  Hey, don't get Bill Cosby involved.  Don't get Bill Cosby involved.  Aldous Huxley.  I was sitting there waiting for your job. 
[03:29:00]  Rudy was disappointed.  Slipped the girl of contact and fingered her.  I don't think Cosby impressions.  Well, it was good enough, though.  Jeff in Tennessee.  What's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to defend Eric and Stan.  I really enjoyed that little request show.  And I hope you guys keep that going.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was something different.  The Kevin and the Allen or whoever the last two guys.  Those are cut suckers. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  Yeah, there you go.  It was something different and people enjoyed it.  I don't...  Spike in Chicago.  I don't like the fact, by the way, that Eric has been getting badmouthed.  I don't like the fact that they're not appreciating your hard work, E-Rock.  Spike.  Yeah, I enjoyed that segment at the end of yesterday's show.  I'm a big Nathaniel fan.  More Nathaniel.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Joe in North Carolina.  Hey, what's up, guys?  See, we're taking these calls to make ourselves feel better.  Yeah.  I've been with you guys from NEW, Day One at XM, and I'm so tired of these whiny bastards 
[03:30:00]  crying, bitching, and complaining about the fucking phenomenal deal you guys have made  and how you guys are basically doing all this for them.  Would they much rather you guys fucking took off for a month and played a worse stuff for  a month while you figured all this shit out?  Well, I hate to bring up...  ...the great radio that you have been giving us.  Wait to see what happens.  I'm doing first hits.  No, I'm teasing.  And you know, people also have to realize that with the new deal came new money, and  we need more time to spend it.  You guys are fancy men, and you deserve that money. 
[03:30:30]  Seriously, you guys are busting your asses for us, the true hardcore fans like me.  We would have never gotten Edward Norton.  We get Edward Norton now.  We get bigger guests, and we got a huge announcement that has something to do with this show in hopefully  a week or two that would have never happened unless we made this deal.  Guys, I can't wait to see what you guys have planned.  All right, thank you, sir.  Thanks, Joe.  All right, Billy Connolly.  You don't need to make excuses for what you do.  Oh, for some reason we do. 
[03:31:00]  I don't know why.  Because you've run away and left them.  Is that it?  We've abandoned them.  Because deep down, we know they're right.  Oh, Mike, deep down, there's guilt.  Hey, do you listen to heavy metal music?  Yeah, from time to time.  Well, in as much as I don't mind it, you know.  Yeah.  We're doing the top ten greatest metal songs of all time and just kind of having fun and  making jokes and stuff.  I don't know if I have a favorite.  Well, I don't either.  I don't really have a favorite.  It comes on, I listen.  Well, the list was Motorhead, Ace of Spades in 10th place. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Lemmy is a pisser.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a stunner.  Ace of Spades is the only words you hear, isn't it?  That is pretty much it.  Yeah.  And he puts his microphone here, like about three feet above where anybody else would put  it.  Yeah.  So the whole night, his head's back like that.  And he's got it all over.  Ace of Spades!  And he strains this thing up, yeah.  Yeah.  And he has to hold that wart in case it comes off with a vibration.  All right. 
[03:32:00]  And then in 9th place, Ozzy, Crazy Train.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Then Slayer.  You ever listen to Slayer?  No.  8th place with Raining Blood.  It's a shame that we don't listen to Slayer.  That's a good song.  That sounded pretty good.  I like that a lot.  7 Iron Maiden, The Number of the Beast.  And now we're up to 6.  You like Kiss?  Yes, I do.  Is it Rock and Roll Night?  I don't know.  But it's kind of, that's not really heavy metal, is it?  Kiss.  It's kind of pop, really.  Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't consider that heavy metal.  I think it should be Deuce, but they probably gave it to Rock and Roll Night. 
[03:32:30]  Anyone else?  Stop.  That'll be one of the heavy ones.  What?  You know, you just keep, I like how you do that.  You always cover yourself.  He guesses one thing, and then he says, well, it should be that, but he knows it's not going  to be that.  Come on, a rock and roll of shit.  I do like to have two guesses to everybody else's one.  But there's also the valid point that Rock and Roll Night is the anthem, and that's  the big one, and Deuce is, I think, a better song.  Okay, but then you get neither one right, and then you say, I was going to say that.  Well, Number of the Beast, I was going to say, but I...  There's paranoid on the list. 
[03:33:00]  We haven't gotten there.  He's stepping up.  It's one of the best songs ever.  Are you trying to skip ahead, sir?  Are you trying to skip ahead?  No, I didn't understand.  Do you know what our listeners will say if you skip?  You were much better when you were on until 12.  I like Billy Connolly.  That's what they'll say.  I like the way you lost it after 11.  I know.  After 11, they just stink.  It's fell to bits, man.  I'm glad you're coming off at 11.  It's because they sold out.  They like when we go past 11, because we get really punch drunk. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  It gets really silly in here.  Because we've been up since 3 in the morning.  All right, so Kiss, sixth place.  You ready?  You don't have a guess?  Okay.  Beth.  It's Detroit, Rock City.  Oh, yeah.  You're not even going to say that.  You're going to say it.  Of course.  I actually like that song, but I didn't think of it.  Ah, yeah.  Okay, this one.  Great chisel.  Yeah, this one was all right.  That's great. 
[03:34:00]  Come on, people.  With its feather boa, yeah.  They're rocking.  I've been a long time.  Saturday night.  Would this play be playing when you're fantasizing them kicking you down the stairs or hugging  you?  Both.  Because I would see them on the Destroyer tour in those outfits.  The very famous photo shoot they did with the snow behind them. 
[03:34:30]  Yeah.  Like, that was the outfits that they were beating me and hurting me in.  So Jimmy would fantasize.  Oh, you've got to tell Billy Connolly this story.  Yeah.  This is the truth.  I'm 37, so I grew up listening to Kiss in the 70s.  And my first fantasy when I was seven years old would be that Kiss would show up to my  apartment with their makeup and costumes and beat me and really hurt me and throw me down  the stairs and then hug me and love me and make me feel better.  Like, after they heard them, they would cuddle me.  What were you doing when you were thinking these things?  I don't know.  It was just like, I used to, what I would do is I would kneel by my bed. 
[03:35:00]  This is for, I never, I would like, I would have to shit.  I wouldn't let myself shit.  I would just kneel there and have to shit and fantasize about this kind of stuff.  You are the twisted son of a bitch, man.  I would never, I always had this, like, this whole toilet thing.  I would never shit for you.  I would hold it in.  My God.  He's got the weirdest, like, fantasy things.  I dreamt I murdered Paul McCartney once.  Yeah?  Yeah, and buried him at a traffic lights in Glasgow.  It doesn't, it doesn't relate to anything I've ever thought or done in my life. 
[03:35:30]  You dreamt you married McCartney?  I murdered him.  No, murdered him.  Oh, I thought you said married him.  I was like, did you wake up missing a show?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Oh.  All right.  I wake up feeling limp.  Come on, guys.  You're talking about an icon here.  What do you guys think?  Yeah.  Billy Connolly is twisted.  We now officially love Billy Connolly.  That's how you should laugh at that job.  I've been a Billy Connolly fan for years, man. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Fucking a long time, yeah.  When was your special?  You did a special, a great stand-up.  He's famous all over the world.  Like, the U.S. is like the last place Billy got known.  I mean, he was famous all over the world.  What was your special?  I did one with Whoopi.  And then I did one on my own after that.  Pale blue Scottish person.  That was like the 80s, right?  That's right, yeah.  Where are you from?  Scotland.  Oh, Scotland.  Yeah.  The humour a lot different over there?  Not really.  It's pretty much the same everywhere. 
[03:36:30]  I think you're...  Well, wait.  I want to argue that, though, because a lot of American comics can't go over to England  and do that well.  Scotland is in England.  Oh, most of them do, really.  Well, I mean, just in Europe in general.  Yeah.  They do well at festivals and all that.  Yeah?  I think it's...  Yeah.  We don't have as many radio stations as you do have.  We're very few like this one.  Yeah.  And so there's little outlets sometimes.  But when they come to festivals like Edinburgh and London, they do incredibly well, because  they're great.  I think they're the best comedians in the world. 
[03:37:00]  I think the British ones are best at being on television and doing that sketch stuff.  They are stunningly good and getting better.  And the Americans are much, much better live.  You know, that's live comedy.  Because I think the guys who do the sketches are like actors doing funny stuff.  Right.  And it's kind of hard to do that.  They're not like comedians, you know, dedicated to being a comedian, you know.  On stage.  Doesn't want to write a sitcom or sketches.  They just want to go on and tell it like it is.  Yeah.  And it's kind of hard to work the crowd if you're more of an actor. 
[03:37:30]  And I think humor used to be different from place to place.  Even throughout America, say, like, North Carolina humor would be different to Maine and all  That's true.  Yeah.  The Bible Belt.  But, yeah, but with the satellite and cable TV and all that stuff and internet, everybody's  becoming a big mushy, a big, they're all getting together, a big.  The world is getting smaller.  Yeah.  I love it how you, Scott, you sing.  You just sing your words.  Just like Sean Connery.  Just sing.  Yeah.  Sean Connery hasn't lived there for how long? 
[03:38:00]  That's right.  He couldn't find Scotland in a tax.  This guy's been living in Spain for his whole life, I think.  He hasn't beaten a woman in Scotland since 1972.  1972.  If you miss Scotland, reload and fire again.  Sean Connery.  Let's go to Seth in Maine.  Seth, what's up?  Oh, I'm begging.  Jimmy, please tell me that fantasy wasn't true about you holding in your shit.  Dude, he's saying it's the most disturbing thing he's ever heard you say.  I would hold the shit.  I wouldn't fantasize about them in shit.  I would be kneeling by my bed, almost in prayer form, zoning out, fantasizing, like 
[03:38:30]  holding in shit, not going.  Well, I mean, the guy that came in yesterday and the shit on himself was disturbing, but  this takes it to a whole new level.  Yeah, like there's a reason you did that, whatever psycho reason that you never sorted  out.  Yeah, maybe it was shame.  Who knows?  Penis shame?  I don't know what it was.  I'm sorry.  It wasn't healthy.  How old were you?  Maybe seven or eight.  See, that's so young that-  I thought I was going to say 28.  No.  That's so young that like-  It's just makeup envy. 
[03:39:00]  It's just something odd.  What could have happened between birth and seven that made you do that?  I don't know.  I'm sure there are some things.  But that's what the whole anal thing is based on, though, isn't it?  You know, if you're neat and tidy, they say you're anal, but it goes back to when you're  a child and you can control your shit, you realize you can have power over your parents  by holding it in and watching them panic and then doing it when they least expect it.  That's their first- your first power as a human. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, your first power.  The power of shit.  And your parents think there's something dreadful wrong with you, and they run about panicking,  and it's a nice feeling, you know?  Wow.  I never even thought of it that way.  I was working out.  You were working out.  And then as soon as they phoned the doctor, you shit yourself, and you're okay.  That was a conniving little douche.  That makes sense.  But you've aligned it to prayer, which is a different thing.  Yeah, that's a little weird.  Well, I wasn't praying.  I was actually just in that. 
[03:40:00]  I used to kneel on my bed, like on the floor.  It wasn't that I would pray, but I could never sit when I had to think of dump.  When you have to think of dump, you can't sit on a chair because it's just too uncomfortable.  So kneeling was cool, like you let a little poke out and you pull it back in.  That's so odd, man.  I don't know why certain things happen when you're a kid.  You're so young, yet nothing affects you in a certain way.  Yet you have certain phobias and things.  Because I remember like five years old being petrified of strangers, things like that. 
[03:40:30]  My brother and sister had no problem.  Like back in the old days, when my father and mother had to go into the store, they'd leave us in the car.  That's what you did back then.  You just shut the door, roll the window down a little like you're a dog, and they'd leave you in the car.  And if anybody came up to the side of the car because they were getting into the car next to ours because it was theirs,  I would freak out, lose my mind.  My brother and sister's sitting there fine, and I'd be like, like the guy's going to break in and kidnap us.  Like where does it come from?  Have you seen photos of yourself when you were young? 
[03:41:00]  That was a justifiable fear.  I'm not a pedophile.  When I see photos of him when he was a child, I'm like, I would have fucking fumbled with him in a second.  Look who's talking.  You are just a tussleable little tyke.  I looked like a young lesbian with my stupid glasses and my fucking half a mullet.  You do look like Billie Jean King.  I thought my mullet was half of something.  Can you have half a mullet, which is like a quarter of a haircut? 
[03:41:30]  Look, that's little Jimmy.  That's me when I was a kid.  Oh, what?  And that's me.  That's Anthony.  They were put together because he's older than I am, obviously.  Oh, that's very good.  Oh, you are splendid.  Look how adorable little Jimmy is with his glasses.  We are a couple of dreamy-eyed fairies, aren't we?  Hey, Mikey has a question, I guess, for Billy Connolly.  Mikey, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Billy has a hilarious story about when he was a kid and how he discovered masturbation. 
[03:42:00]  I was wondering if he'd just share that with everybody.  Yeah, you've got a national audience here.  And it wasn't so much.  I was masturbating with my friend in a park, and he announced to me that you only get 100 masturbations.  You only get 100 orgasms.  Wow.  So you have to last your whole life.  100, that's it.  You know, 100.  What a prick.  And I would tell the audience that I never forgot how panic-stricken I was at 101, which was the following afternoon. 
[03:42:30]  I don't know what the other one I did was lying in my hand until it went dead.  Yeah, the old numb.  Yeah, and I'm doing it, and it feels like someone else.  Yeah, the numb jerk.  I don't know if that was the only, but that's the masturbation one.  That was when it was very good when you were a kid, you know, to experiment with everything.  I mean, you tried everything in the house, and then you get older and just toss it off and get it over with. 
[03:43:00]  But back then, it was an adventure.  Yeah.  It was like, let me just lay on my hand to get it numb.  Yeah.  Or let me try fucking this.  Yeah.  Open the bridge.  Or trying to do it between your fingers or kind of roly-poly it.  Between the two hands to see if it works.  Yeah, you're willing to experiment.  Oh, God.  It's kind of limited experience.  Yeah.  But you don't have to look your best. 
[03:43:30]  No.  But you're alone.  I remember when I was a little kid.  I was really young.  My friend and I were, like, experimenting a little bit.  I mean, I'm really young.  And I put my penis through a Hulk doll like it was the Hulk doll.  I straddle my penis, and he blew me while I was holding the Hulk doll.  There he goes.  There's another Jimmy story.  Write the book, Jimmy.  And you know, it's these little therapy sessions that I appreciate so much.  It's comedy and therapy.  My name's Billy, and I'm all fucked up. 
[03:44:00]  It's comedy and therapy at the same time.  So you put it between the legs of the Hulk doll?  Yeah.  So it looked like Hulk had a penis.  Yeah, like it was Hulk's penis, not mine.  Did you pull the string on the Hulk doll, and it went, no homo.  Oh, are you awful.  Yeah.  Wow.  Same friend that might have shared Monsterian under the porch thing's story?  No.  No, different friend.  You were a little whore.  That was a dirty boy. 
[03:44:30]  Was?  This guy's still laughing.  Yeah, John, what's up?  I'm trying to break my mask.  Hey, listen.  Billy, you've got to tell these guys, is it true you went bungee jumping in the nude?  Yes, I did.  It's free.  In New Zealand, if you bungee in the nude, it's free.  Really?  Yeah.  So I took my clothes off and did it.  We were making a film about traveling around New Zealand, so I did it naked.  I'd be afraid there'd be some kind of snapback or something. 
[03:45:00]  Like, you're getting some support with...  It's very gentle.  It's a lovely thing.  As a matter of fact, not only is it gentle, but when you get to the real bottom of the  whole thing and you shoot up, it's even more pleasant than flying.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you feel like you're flying.  It stretches to its extreme and then it goes...  So you shoot into the air upside down with your penis smacking off your stomach.  And it's very, very good.  But it's free.  It's completely free if you do it alone.  The worst is if you shoot back unevenly, like if the force pulls your legs back faster 
[03:45:30]  and your cock is waiting there for you on the way up.  I nearly did that at yoga once.  Nearly, damn it.  Yes.  I was falling backwards and I got a good look at my penis from there.  As I was kind of folded up, you know, my legs were kind of...  Can you reach closer than you wanted?  Like a bizarre Indian statue and I fell backwards and I fucking nearly swallowed my dick.  Were you able to reach?  Did you give it the extra effort to try to reach? 
[03:46:00]  If I could do this...  Actually, you know you're on a mat with a broken neck.  A little tongue extension.  You don't want to be found with a broken neck on your bed.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Yeah, I used to use the jack.  I used to take an orange juice squeezer and use it to jack.  Wow.  You know when you cut an orange in half and you put it on,  it almost looks like a bullet and then it spins and then the juice goes out. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  I used to grease it up and rest my sack on it and then turn it on  and then jack while it was rubbing against my...  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That's a little dangerous.  That's dangerous.  Oh.  Well, that goes back and forward, doesn't it?  It doesn't just go in a circle.  Yeah.  It's just that my mother has to buy another one every other week, you know?  What did you finger your ass with?  A cheese grater?  And didn't you think maybe your family was using this to juice with?  Yeah.  No, no.  What I was doing was I stole it from my mother and she never find it, 
[03:47:00]  so she had to buy another one.  Oh.  About like three of them.  You know, I have some problems too, so what are you going to do?  Well, you're perfect for this.  Imagine your mom drinking orange juice.  I'm going picking a hair out of her mouth.  Or the worst is if she's like, I want more of this.  Oh, this is a nice flavor.  By the way, the No Filter Paul video is up on OpenEthed.com.  Yeah, I heard it's really disgusting.  I think we need to share this with Billy Connolly.  What do you think?  Well, it happened yesterday.  We had this guy, No Filter Paul.  He's an English gentleman.  A gentleman. 
[03:47:30]  He's really a prick.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty much it.  This is a man.  Yeah.  Well, use the term loosely.  Oh, my God.  Just watch this, Billy.  He screwed up.  Oh, he's going to do it.  Yeah.  Just watch.  Oh, God.  He's melting.  He's melting.  And it's green, too, for some reason.  Oh, God. 
[03:48:00]  He got on our bare side and see how he had to repay his debt.  Why are all those people fully dressed standing around him?  That was in here yesterday.  Well, that was in here.  That's right about where you're sitting.  Right where you're sitting.  No.  Yeah, we had it disinfected.  Pretty good.  Other places get, like, strippers with big tits and porn chicks.  We get fat British men to shit their pants.  Yeah, he drank.  What was that stuff called?  It's something that you drink before you get a colonoscopy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and it clears you out.  So a half hour, 45 minutes later, he couldn't hold it in, and he just let loose. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  So that video's up there, and it's getting viewed like crazy.  He doesn't wear a diaper for sex reasons or anything.  Well, we don't know his personal life that much, but not that day.  So you're telling me he whipped off his pants and he had the diaper on?  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  How English is that?  It's very English, isn't it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That video clip is going to be making the rounds on all those sites that have deplorable stuff on him. 
[03:49:00]  Is it on break.com yet?  Ask Steve if he's farming that video out.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  We're hanging out with Billy Connolly.  How are you doing today, guys?  We're having fun, Rob.  There you go, man.  I got a story here.  I got some seven Mexican fellows that worked for me, and I walked in from a hotel room one time,  and they were having a circle jerk with the bed.  They had warm-up bags between the bed and the box springs filled with hand lotion, 
[03:49:30]  and they were all beaten off into the bed at the same time with a laptop computer on the bed watching a porno.  Yeah.  That's about it.  It was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.  Okay.  All right.  I really don't have much to add to that.  I'm actually looking around this room just doing a quick head count.  We need two more.  All right.  Top ten greatest heavy metal songs of all time. 
[03:50:00]  We're up to what?  Number five.  Yes.  All right.  It's Judas Priest.  Big Judas Priest fan.  Billy?  Yes.  I like them.  Didn't he shoot himself in the...  Weren't they the ones who...  Oh, yeah.  They were the ones who had the track on the album that made the boy shoot himself.  That's what he said in court.  Wasn't it Judas Priest?  It happened at Ozzy and Judas Priest.  Yeah.  If he played his album backwards, he could hear a duet or something.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  Screaming for vengeance, by the way.  Yep.  Screaming for vengeance.  It was really weird because I saw a film of that guy.  The one who...  One died and one survived.  And the one who survived had the rifle too far forward.  Oh, right.  To his chain.  And it shot like the middle of his face off.  Yeah.  And he looked like an ass.  It was sort of folded in the middle.  He shot the middle of his face out and that would have became the butt crack.  Yeah.  Aye.  Oh, God. 
[03:51:00]  And he's now a sort of talking ass, you know.  So, people, if you're going to kill yourself, you've got to make sure the gun is a little further back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most people that try to kill themselves and fail usually wind up screwing themselves up so bad that their life is now worse than it was before they tried to kill themselves.  And you should always put the gun in your mouth and aim up.  If you put it to the side of your head, apparently, at the last second you pull away, you can't help it.  Oh, and you might just rip an eye out.  And you do the blind thing.  Yeah. 
[03:51:30]  Now you're blind.  Now you're blind when you can't find your guns anymore.  So, it's Judas Priest in fifth place.  Guess the song?  Uh, Screaming for Vengeance.  I'm going to guess that.  But, you know, there's another thought.  Of course there is, Jimmy.  Breaking the law is not heavy enough.  Living after midnight is not heavy enough.  It's got to be Screaming for Vengeance.  Another thing coming?  Come on.  No.  Wow.  You've got another thing coming. 
[03:52:00]  Honestly, first thought, but fucking Screaming for Vengeance is heavier.  Better.  Yeah, I thought so.  Damn.  Damn.  Old MTV.  Is there any ACDC?  Well, ACDC is in fourth place there, Billy.  Want to guess number four?  Highway to Hell.  Highway to Hell?  Nope.  Nah, it's got to be for those about to rock.  No.  No.  No?  No. 
[03:52:30]  Shook me all night long.  The fourth greatest metal song of all time.  Wait.  ACDC.  Wait, fucking, uh, wait, wait.  I've got to say, it's got to be, uh, Dirty Deeds.  Dirty.  Yeah.  Back in black.  Why?  Because it starts like that.  It's very heavy.  Do you know what they call them in Australia?  Akka-daka.  Really?  Akka-daka.  Akka-daka.  The wacky Aussies.  ACDC, wakka-daka. 
[03:53:00]  Let's go to Phillip in Arkansas.  Phillip.  What up, guys?  What's up, Phillip?  Hi, Phillip.  Hey, first of all, fuck that guy from New Jersey.  There's plenty of good things in Arkansas.  All right.  But second of all, I want to tell a story about a guy who had already tried to shoot himself  and hang himself, and that didn't work.  So he tried to ram a chainsaw through his neck, and he got stuck in his spine and paralyzed  him from the neck down.  Oh, my God.  What about a fucking loser?  He's over three.  God must have a special plan for him. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  A chainsaw.  Why a chainsaw?  He's bogged down in his spine and quit.  I can imagine.  Can you imagine?  The vibration would make you lose your grip on it, and all the blood you'd slide off  the handle.  Oh, no kidding.  And stop the freak.  It's not a very good, clean...  Yeah.  Talon, what's up?  Oh, my God.  That's rough.  Hey, I'd like to ask Billy about how, excuse me, about working on The Last Samurai with  Tom Cruise.  He had a, you know, it was a short part, but it was pretty good there, and how bad did it 
[03:54:00]  suck that his character died in that faggot Cruise loop?  It was a brilliant thing to work on, yeah.  And I died very bravely.  But I die a lot.  I didn't mind dying early.  I do it in lots of movies.  I'm one of the few people to die in a Muppet movie, actually.  Yeah, in Treasure Island, I die a horrible death.  So, it doesn't bother me, but he's a great guy. 
[03:54:30]  I know it's very fashionable to knock him, but he really is the loveliest of men.  I like him very much.  He's a great guy.  I liked that movie.  I didn't think I was going to like it because, you know, again, because he was in it, and  I thought it would kind of take away.  It's kind of not known as a guy that's in a movie, and you think, wow, this is going  to be a great, you know, movie, without it being an action movie or something like  that.  Without that matinee idol look, you know, he's too handsome.  Yeah, maybe that's a bastard.  That's why people hate him.  But I liked that movie.  I thought it was really good. 
[03:55:00]  What do you do with your hands?  See, here's my problem with acting.  I have the same problem.  He doesn't know what to do.  I like to act, but I mean, I just, like, whenever I have to do dialogue standing, it's really  hard to do.  Well, find something.  Scratch one of them.  That maybe.  Oh, that's kind of good.  Like, just very natural.  Yeah.  But I can't do that for, like, the whole scene.  I look like I have eggnog.  But the next thing you know, you'll be doing something else, you know.  So, just be.  Just let him hang.  Don't hold him up above your waist. 
[03:55:30]  Just leave him there.  Let him hang naturally.  Yeah.  Listening is hard, too.  When you're listening to seeing someone talking.  Yeah.  Don't do anything when you're listening.  Don't look as if you're listening.  You know, people do this, point their ear towards someone.  Yeah.  I tend to nod a lot.  Yeah.  Everyone does it naturally when you're just in life.  Mm-hmm.  And then the second you're supposed to be acting, you forget what you do every day of  your life without even thinking about it.  And if you watch extras in the atmosphere of people in a bar, see, they're all nodding 
[03:56:00]  like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But people in life don't do that.  They do in a hood.  Why isn't your mic coming?  You watch the extras.  There's never a man and wife at the table not talking.  But in any restaurant you go to.  Have you been to Harlem?  Any restaurant, yeah.  They'd be in Harlem.  They'd be like, yeah, man, I told him.  It's all about the hands.  But if you, you know, there's lots of people in restaurants, men and women, who've, they've  said it all 20 years ago.  Yeah.  And they just eat their dinner.  Just sit and eat. 
[03:56:30]  Look around, kind of bored.  Well, extras never do that.  No, they're always animated.  Peas and carrots, carrots and peas.  They're just repeating the same shit because that looks natural when you talk.  Certain things they repeat.  Yeah, no, no.  There's certain things they repeat.  Yeah.  Peas and carrots.  Hey, let's say hi to Gary in Mississippi.  Gary?  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Let's go, Gary.  I'm doing dialogue with Jimmy.  Sorry.  Hey.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  You're on.  Talk, stupid.  You're on.  Good morning.  Hi.  I want to say hi to Billy. 
[03:57:00]  I'm a big fan of his stand-up and especially of Boondock Saints.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  That was a great movie.  But I've been reading some rumors and a bunch of people said there's a sequel coming out.  I wanted to know if there was any truth to that.  Yeah, there is a sequel.  Well, it's written, but the guy, Troy Duffy, who wrote and directed the first one, is in  kind of some kind of legal problem with a guy.  Boondock is owned by someone else now.  You know, to get the money to make it in the first place, he had to borrow all sorts of 
[03:57:30]  stuff and it didn't make it back and someone else now owns it and he, for some legal reason  that I don't really understand, he can't be making the new one just now, but it'll happen  later.  They do have a website, I think, Boondock Saints, and they keep people up to scratch  on it.  But I hope, I hope they do make it.  He's got some great ideas.  He's a great director.  And not only that, he's been really badly treated.  The two of the guys who were on the movie, he made a little movie that was supposed to 
[03:58:00]  be PR, public relations, about the making of the movie.  And they turned it against him, saying what a bastard he was, and showed it at film festivals.  What a couple of pricks.  Yeah, when he was kind enough to let them do it in the first place.  And then they turned it against, and they said, he's a hard man and he's a bully.  Well, what he is, he's rock and roll.  He's not film.  And that's why I liked him.  He was lovely to get on with, and he didn't know how to treat people sometimes. 
[03:58:30]  And that's okay by me.  Yeah.  It's a lot better than he'd treated Syripy by some fucking limp-wristed.  His mother gave him the money to make the movie, you know?  Yeah.  But he's hard, and he's good, and his ideas are great, and he's just smashing.  I hope it gets done soon.  That was one of those movies that really hit its stride in video.  Yes, that's where it made it.  It became an underground cult.  It didn't come out.  It only did one cinema.  Yeah.  And I found out, I remember I was in the video store kind of looking around.  I was like, what is this? 
[03:59:00]  I read the back of the box, thought it sounded interesting.  I watched it, and went, how come I've never heard of this movie?  Yeah, Willem Dafoe's lovely movie.  Yeah, and then everyone started talking about it.  It became a big, like, kind of underground cult hit.  Yeah.  And I'm El Ducci, and I can, I'm the killer.  But if you notice in my scenes, I can't even hit the building.  I couldn't hit Yankee Stadium.  I don't know why.  Oh, yeah, I shot somebody's pinky off, didn't I?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Mark in California. 
[03:59:30]  Mark.  Hey, guys.  I lived in Aberdeen for about eight years, and one of the best comedy bits I think I've  ever seen was from Pale Blue Scotsman.  Can you talk about when those guys, the sadistic fucking bastard headmasters used to make those  kids swim in the ocean?  Oh, yeah.  The teachers used to take us to Aberdeen on holiday, and we had to swim in the sea.  Well, it's the North Sea, for Christ's sake. 
[04:00:00]  And just over the horizon, there's men in safety suits on oil rigs, you know, survival  suits.  Oh, right.  But you have to strip and run into the sea.  And I always remember that not so much your feet and legs, but as the sea was just coming  close to your balls.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  And the noise, it was the same noise as a donkey having a hot potato shoved up its  ass. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, no!  No!  And always, you're putting it off and putting it off, and your balls are about three inches  off the sea.  And then some bastard would come by on a speed board, and this wave, you were frightened  to run in case you fell, you know, or get your whole body wet.  Wait, I got to throw out, Billy's actually doing gigs, too, which I'm really, I want  to go see.  He's only doing 20 Dates from New York, starting May 9th, 37 Arts Theater, which is on 450 West 
[04:01:00]  37th Street, and you can get tickets to Ticketmaster, or 212-307-4100, that starts May 9th at 37 Arts  Theater, which is on 37th Street.  Oh, my God, I'll be there.  Really, really funny, man.  But don't go after 11, we won't be there.  He sucks after 11.  Doesn't even try.  He takes those 11 pills.  Let's go to Brady.  Brady, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony, little Jimmy. 
[04:01:30]  Hi.  Mr. Kelly, would you do us the favor of doing your aristocrat?  Because of all the people in that movie, you're the one I wanted to see more of.  Oh, yeah.  I can't even remember it.  You just make it up as you go along.  Right.  Go for it.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to hang out with you.  If you want to see Billy's aristocrats, you have to see them live.  You have to.  And pre-11.  Pre-11.  See, I would have done the aristocrats, but as far as I can see, it's a minute after.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  What are you doing there, Ant? 
[04:02:00]  I'm on overtime right now.  Overtime.  Trent it in.  I'm performing a courtesy right now.  Courtesy.  Through the kindness of his heart.  Right.  He's a giving person.  A giver.  Look at me give.  Every flick of that secondhand.  He gives and gives and gives and gives.  Some are takers.  Do you know the world's made up of two kinds of guys?  And one of them's givers.  Right.  And I'm proud to sit opposite a giver.  Thank you, sir.  This man is spewing goodwill all over the table. 
[04:02:30]  An ungrateful bastard.  Even after being shit on.  Yeah.  I'm still sitting here at 11.02.  He knows very well.  There's a huge clock on the wall.  Yeah.  It's not as if he doesn't realize it's already 11.  No.  He knows very well.  But he's a giver.  He gives from the center of his very beard.  Hallelujah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Because I try.  Do you have a website, Billy?  Yes.  BillyConnelly.com.  That's it.  All right.  You got it.  C-O-N-N-O-L-L-Y.  Two N's and two L's in the last name. 
[04:03:00]  Let's say hi to Trenton in Texas.  Trenton.  Hey, boys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  Great show.  Yeah, I wanted to talk to Jimmy about why he thought Back in Black shouldn't be number  four.  It's the sixth best-selling album of all time.  No, I'm not saying it's not a great song.  ACDC, I understand, sells a lot.  I just prefer some of the other songs to that one.  Like, I think Dirty Deeds is a better song and it's heavier.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, yeah, it's just a harder riff, you know, than Dirty Deeds, I think.  And, you know, like, Angus Young just performs, like, you know, the lead guitarist. 
[04:03:30]  He puts out, like, you know, harder riffs than most of these crowd bands, which are called  heavy metal.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Sometimes they don't even call ACDC heavy metal.  Yeah, they call it.  Yeah, I know.  They call them, like, punk rock or whatever.  Hard rock or something.  Yeah.  For queers.  Right, right.  This guy's a freaking musicologist.  But I think they do better that way by not being beside Saxon and all these people.  You know, I think they do.  Pitching hole.  Yeah.  I think they get bigger and better audiences myself. 
[04:04:00]  I think I have to shit.  My stomach is blood.  You want to just pray on the side of the console and hold it in?  I've got a rosary.  You want to get on with it?  Let's get back to the list.  The French tickler.  The top ten greatest metal songs of all time.  We've got to do this before we get out of here.  We've got to do this before we get out of here, too.  Number three.  It's a Metallica song.  Oh, I don't know, man.  Seek and Destroy.  Master of Puppets.  Battery?  Fuck.  Why did I say that?  It's Master of Puppets. 
[04:04:30]  Oh.  This rocks.  Although I do like Sabotru.  But I know a lot of purists really don't like Sabotru, but I like Sabotru.  Yeah.  That's like beginner Metallica to a lot of people.  Yeah, I know.  Although I love Sabotru as well.  All right.  Number two.  Top ten greatest metal songs of all time.  Guns N' Roses.  That's a little weird.  Mmm.  Paradise City?  No.  No. 
[04:05:00]  No way.  Are you crazy?  I blurted out the first one that came to mind, and it's after 11.  Welcome to the jungle.  Of course, I love my jungle.  Opinion just sucks.  Post-11 blues.  Post-11.  It's, yes, it is Welcome to the Jungle.  You said that, Jimmy?  Yeah, of course.  You're smart, Jimmy.  Well, if I was, I would have known Master of Puppets was Master of Puppets.  Instead of blurting out another song as it played, like a douche. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, they kind of changed the face of music for that whole period of time.  They did.  Before we get to the number one greatest metal song of all time, we want to thank Billy Connolly  for stopping by.  Yes, absolutely.  It's been a real pleasure.  Thanks very much.  You're going to be in the city for a while, so can you come back and hang with us again?  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to.  There's nothing more.  Anytime you want to stop by, you're a fun guy to have around.  I would love to.  Thank you.  And let me give out to Billy's information, too.  It's starting May 9th, only 20 dates. 
[04:06:00]  37 Arcs Theatre, which is on 37th Street here in New York, 212-307-4100, or Ticketmaster.  And Billy is just a great, great comic.  Thanks.  I'm glad you got rid of me before the naked section, anyway.  We'll have you back, because he's got the twisted sense of his humor.  Dr. Ian Smith, thanks.  Your mailbox is full.  Everyone's trying to get the Fat Smash Diet book.  Yeah, I'm going to clear it out.  So at noon, you can email me at fatsmashdiet.com, and we'll take new people. 
[04:06:30]  All right.  Because you'll have lost the will to live by then at noon.  That's nearly an hour of time.  Today, we leave you with the number one greatest metal song of all time.  I'll let Anthony do the honors.  It's a long, long way.  Number one?  Oh, hold on.  Anyone want to guess?  He's on the line, but do you want to talk to him really fast?  Anyone want to guess?  You want to talk to him first, or no?  Oh, I was going to make the announcement.  But it's Kevin Huxford.  Come on. 
[04:07:00]  Number one is Go Fuck Yourself by Kevin Huxford.  That's all you get.  That's all you get.  Now we don't tell you.  Why?  Because of you.  Is this Kevin Huxford?  I deserve it.  I deserve it.  Is this really you?  Yeah, it's really me.  All right.  If it's Kevin Huxford, let me...  I just guess.  Let me...  I want confirmation.  Kevin?  Yes, sir?  Is your MySpace account myspace.com slash khuxford? 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  All right, then.  There you go.  Yes.  Not like anybody's going to send you messages or anything at myspace.com slash khuxford.  Yeah, and not like hitting me with all the emails at khuxford2 at yahoo.com either.  Oh, okay.  I'll take my abuse, man.  I fired it off like an idiot.  I was a little, you know...  I fire off my mouth too quickly sometimes.  You know, I understand that the anger some people have because it's different. 
[04:08:00]  Ooh, I got a kiss.  A kiss from Billy Connolly.  Aw.  Aw.  I think he's a bit of a poof.  He's a poof-ter.  He's a bit of a poof-ter.  Well, sir, yeah, some points that people have are fine.  But when you said that we, you know, so we can do no work or...  I forgot your exact shitty quote.  Not an ounce of extra work.  And I was sitting there at the time dozing off reading this at the computer because I 
[04:08:30]  was exhausted from getting up early.  And I understand people work hard.  I'm not saying other people don't work hard.  And this is a relatively easy job.  But we're putting in our all.  We're giving it our all to make this work.  If it doesn't work, we're fucked.  And if we don't work hard, this isn't going to work out.  So for somebody like you to just, after a week, say that we're doing things so we don't  have to put in an effort, I want it to choke you.  You know, I had two quick reactions to when you guys were heading out yesterday. 
[04:09:00]  Opie said, so we can go to noon.  And I just had a knee-jerk reaction to that because Opie said a few times that XM would  like when as often as you guys can, not like to say every day or three times a week or two  times a week or anything like that.  But whenever you can, if you can throw the fans a bone by going to noon at 3.  And he's scrubbing his face where Billy Connolly kissed him.  Kissed him on the cheek.  Purell.  I'm Purelling my face.  See, Kevin, we made the mistake.  We do not have to go past 11. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, no.  No one said you had to.  No, you did.  You did.  You did say that.  Because you're stupid enough to tell people that we're going to try to go longer and try  to keep the channel alive until noon.  That was our mistake.  Every time we go past 11, it's us doing it because we feel like it.  That's what it comes down to.  We can leave here every day at 10.55.  If we want.  If we want.  Look who's on the phone.  Yeah, but you know what?  I don't, you know, at the risk of pissing you guys off further.  Too late.  Hey, why don't you talk to Elo instead? 
[04:10:00]  Uh-oh.  I now am saying talk to Elo.  Talk to Elo.  He's on the line.  He's right on the line.  Where's Elo?  He's not doing progress.  Well, Kevin, hold on.  Well, hold on, though.  Kevin and everyone else out there, they've got to understand this is a work in progress.  In progress.  It's getting a lot better.  When Asshole said that he's, I'm revolutionizing radio, Robin.  This is a revolution in radio.  It's going to change the face of radio.  He's full of shit.  What we're doing is revolutionary.  When you do something revolutionary, you have to work on it. 
[04:10:30]  It's a work in progress.  This has never been done before.  So we're working on making it work.  Okay.  Kevin Huxford.  What a pompous name.  Kevin Huxford.  You sound like royalty.  It's an honor from you, sir.  But I'm just saying, you know, I understand it's revolutionary.  Talk to Elo.  He's on the line.  You talk to Elo.  Talk to Elo.  You deal with Elo now.  You know what the amazing thing is? 
[04:11:00]  They just don't give you a break.  It's like they just, I mean, for the love of God, just give.  I mean, before the first show was even over, I was having death threats against my life,  my daughter.  See?  Everything.  Yeah.  You know, it's like unbelievable.  First show.  Calm down.  Don't threaten Elo.  If you don't like Elo, you send him a photo of a penis.  No threats.  I never tried to give a death threat to Elo, just to make that clear.  I'm not one of those people. 
[04:11:30]  No, but I mean, but, you know, the a-hole.  I mean, listen, did you have the one from Pierre in front of you, Anthony?  No, I-I-I'm-I'll-I'll read the one from Pierre when I get home, I guess.  Which one is Pierre?  Oh, no, I did one.  From Pierre.  With a name like Pierre, it must be about a sucking dick.  Pierre Trabeau.  Pierre.  Sucre-bue.  Sucre-bue.  Huh?  It's just for-  Hey, Opie, I'm going to forward to you right now so you can just grab your little gadget  there.  All right, hurry up.  All right.  Hurry up, because we really do want to go home early, Pierre. 
[04:12:00]  All right.  Well, hey, listen, by the way, on the replay issue, by the way, the replay issue, we're going  to fix this issue, okay?  All right, that-  Stop emailing me, God.  That I did agree with.  I think the replay should be played in the order that it's broadcast.  CBS first, and then the XM thing.  So nothing to take them out of context.  And the replay is on steroids, so we're getting rid of a lot of that filler that you have to  sit through if you're listening to us live.  Right.  But again, it's like it's never been done.  It's like people just back away from the email, for God's sakes.  Relax.  I just understood the replay thing, except for when the online version and the satellite 
[04:12:30]  version weren't playing the same thing.  Dude, listen, Kevin, Kevin, listen.  Fix that.  I know far more about this than you do.  I know it's screwed up, okay?  I believe it.  We're working on it.  We've never done this before.  Right.  Relax.  We're trying to figure it all out.  Why can't people realize that, like Kevin Huxford?  Ah, Kevin Huxford.  I love you.  Listen, I love you like a brother.  I'm glad that you love the show.  But listen, we're figuring this out.  We just got to get them.  We got to get the mics to work.  I apologize.  I'm calling you. 
[04:13:00]  From now on, you are Kevin Fuxford.  Kevin Fuxford.  Kevin Fuxford.  How about Kevin Sucks Turd?  Oh, Kevin Sucks Turd.  I like that one, too.  How about Kevin Clucks Bird for the 92.3 version?  The shame is I won't even be able to get those names on Wack Bag because they'll be grabbed  by someone else before I get it.  Oh, yeah.  You go on Wack Bag.  I'm sure they'll love you there.  Well, I'm on Wack Bag, but I'm not going to say it.  Oh, what's your name?  What's your name?  I've been on your thread where you went thermonuclear on everyone on Wack Bag. 
[04:13:30]  I'll say that much.  Uh-huh.  We'll find you.  Well, it's easy to go thermonuclear when you get emails from everybody who just don't  get it.  I know.  That's right.  Well, we do have to work on the filler.  I think we can get a lot more interesting with the filler while we're doing our CBS  show there.  But see, here's the thing.  Nobody understood.  It's like the reason why we played the replay out of order was because we wanted to give  people more of the XM content because, by the way, Kevin, that's what everybody was emailing  me from the moment the show started.  So it's like, we'll do that. 
[04:14:00]  Then everybody's all postal.  So it's like, okay, fine.  We'll flip it back.  I understood that part.  It was like you said, the issue with online and satellite syncing up because I sat on my  desk listening to XM's version, put my car in her XM's version instead of getting me.  I'm Kevin Huxford.  My name is Kevin Huxford.  I'm just a working man trying to raise a family.  All right.  Here's the latest email that E-Lo just sent me.  Wow.  This is a really good one.  I couldn't bring myself to read this one.  This is from Pierre. 
[04:14:30]  Hello?  Wait.  Anthony's on the phone.  Who's calling the millionaire?  I'll just say sorry, everyone, and I'll punch out.  All right.  Thank you very much, fellas.  Bye, Kevin.  Good day to you.  Good day.  Good day, Mr. Huxford.  Let's go to Bill in Boston for one second here.  He's on with E-Lo.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hello, Bill.  What do you say, Bill?  Hey.  I've been a fan since WAAM days.  Oh, Billy.  I've had XM for over a year, and the show has never been better.  Oh, thank you, sir. 
[04:15:00]  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, dude.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Thank you.  We took that call to make ourselves feel better about ourselves.  Here it is.  Mr. Logan from Pierre.  You sold your soul, you corporate fuck.  Ooh.  This show sucks.  Two hours show or two and a half of what I signed up for.  Yeah, that's it.  No it a watered-down shitty show.  Fuck you.  Fuck your commercials.  Fuck CBS.  I want four hours of the XM content, not half the show.  Fuck you and the FCC.  I want four hours on XM.  The let your two fucking millionaires do that lean three-hour commercial for fucking XM. 
[04:15:30]  All right.  Money-grabbing whores.  I want half of my money back.  I'm not here for your other stations, so give me what I sign up for.  I'm reading it word for word.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Nice job, Pierre.  This guy's giving mixed reviews, though.  Yeah.  I like the corporate fuck part, but...  Yeah.  That's the best one.  Oh, my God.  They get better as the day goes on, though.  Yeah.  You know something, Pierre?  What can we tell you?  We're working on doing this. 
[04:16:00]  A lot of people are happy with it.  A lot of people are satisfied with what we're doing.  I think we get to things a lot quicker.  I think a lot of the stuff that we did here on XM before we went to CBS, a lot of stuff  was conversational, stuff that we could do on regular radio.  That's what we're doing over there.  And now we come over here and get right into doing shit that we can do here on XM.  And how about, by the way, Pierre raised that point.  How about when he said the two millionaires? 
[04:16:30]  That's a good point.  Elo, what do you say we work on making a third just to prove him wrong?  I think we should make four, Jimmy.  You and I would just be the other two.  I agree.  You're not a millionaire yet, Elo?  I can't comment on any of this.  He is.  You don't want to be part of the lawsuit, huh?  Top secret.  I can tell you, I wish Pierre would go to a grammar school first and maybe discover  spell check, too.  Yeah, Pierre did do some sloppy spelling.  What are you doing, Anthony?  I don't know.  I'm going to have to change my cell phone.  So anybody that's got it, I'll be sending you a new number. 
[04:17:00]  Apparently, I don't know.  Apparently, my cell phone number got out.  Why?  It got out?  I don't know.  Because now I'm just getting, like, phone calls and then I hear the show being played.  It's probably just one person.  Really?  Whoever's doing that, would you not?  There we go.  Don't be a TV.  Problem solved.  You're bothering the star.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Well, you know what I say to that guy?  I say, hey, fella.  Wow.  Nice Huxford.  Wow.  He's been doing it all day.  He has a problem. 
[04:17:30]  Seriously.  All day, he's been sick.  That's because I was sick yesterday.  My stomach.  He's got a sour stomach.  My stomach's sour.  Jimmy gets sour stomach sometimes.  I get scared.  My stomach is sour.  If he drinks too much half and half, it gets sour.  No, you know what it was?  I had coffee and I had some bagel today.  I hadn't eaten it all yesterday.  Hey, Ian.  Before we let you go, we're going to have a gas contest in here in the very near future.  A gas?  Yeah, because we've had it with Jimmy, so we're all going to, like, you know, do a fart thing in studio, 
[04:18:00]  see who gets everyone else to leave.  Oh, dear God.  Any advice?  I was thinking whole milk and grapes.  Oh, how to get it?  How to get it?  No way.  How to get the most?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  Baked beans all the way.  Just baked beans and what?  No, I would just do, I do Hunan food.  Nah.  Baked beans and grapes?  Grapes seem to do it for me for some reason.  Not really.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Baked beans with hot dogs.  Give me a recipe. 
[04:18:30]  All right, baked beans and hot dogs, that's it?  Baked beans and hot dogs, yep.  And throw some syrup in there, too.  I'm serious.  Some syrup.  I don't listen to Dr. Ian.  When I need farts, I'll eat something special and have some half and half.  And then you can all broadcast in the hallway.  Oh, God.  We're going to do the fart contest very soon.  Whenever you're ready, kid.  I think I might be ready next week.  I'm sure a lot of you do.  You've got a few home runs and double-A ball.  You want to step up to the majors.  I welcome your appearance.  All right.  I think it's cute.  The kids want to come and play in the majors.  And I welcome them. 
[04:19:00]  Elo, what else is going on?  Oh, it's all big hootenanny.  Yeah.  I've got Jimmy Johnson coming in for lunch today.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  You and Jimmy?  Me and Jimmy get a hang.  That's nice.  You're going to describe driving habits?  Stop it.  Stop it.  All right.  Vroom, vroom.  Jimmy drives at 200 miles an hour and doesn't get a scratch.  Yeah.  Jimmy drives 200 miles an hour. 
[04:19:30]  He doesn't show pictures to all his friends.  His car's fine.  What did I miss?  His car's fine.  We'll show you the picture.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  All right.  All right, guys.  Vroom, vroom.  Thank you, Elo.  All right.  I'll talk to you guys later.  See you later, boss.  Bye, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  He wanted out of that conversation.  He certainly did.  He was like, I'm out of here.  Tomorrow, John Montone, audio blog.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, apparently John gets a little risque on those things. 
[04:20:00]  Ooh.  He's one of the newscasters here on 1010 Winds, the news station here in New York City.  And they're pretty straightforward stories about, you know, the snow plows out in force today.  We're talking with plow drivers and commuters.  And it snowed heavily indeed.  Back to you.  But then he does this blog thing where he's like, and these fucking assholes.  Yeah.  Actually, we should do it.  It's a potty mouth.  We should do it here.  It'll be quick.  What?  Then we can get out of here.  Look at what we're giving you. 
[04:20:30]  I want to do it at CBS with the good listeners.  We do it here.  Because we were just talking about the CBS deal.  That's what he's talking about.  All right.  Let's get the unappreciative asses some entertainment.  All right.  So this is John Montone.  He has an audio blog.  And he talks about the O&A CBS deal.  And he thanks us in this or something?  Does he?  I don't know.  Let's get into it here.  Hi.  This is John Montone.  CBS Radio, the company I work for, has gone out on the limb, acted boldly, daringly, and 
[04:21:00]  actually hired a couple of radio talk show hosts to host a radio talk show.  Opie and Anthony are back on 92.3 Free FM, which had become listener Free FM for a few  months, while the previous host, a fellow who could sing rock and roll, struggled to  find his voice without guitars accompanying it.  CBS Radio is hoping the O&A virus will spread far and wide, bringing in the millions of 
[04:21:30]  listeners and ad dollars that disappeared while the singer chatted away.  I hope they're a big ratings winner as well, for selfish reasons, the company stock I have  in my 401k, and because I like to listen to talk radio pros talking on the radio.  Of course, it could all blow up if O&A convinced some of their more impressionable fans to, say,  engage in an orgy outside of a daycare center. 
[04:22:00]  Nevertheless, they have already served the public interest by including in their show  TV news teasers, those alarming drop-ins that scare the be-jesus out of us while we're  dozing off during Seinfeld.  Bird flu, you may already be infected.  Tune in Fox 5 at 10.  Cat owners, that little kitten may kill you while you sleep.  Pet horror stories tonight at 11. 
[04:22:30]  Cheerios, the silent killer, medical findings that will shock you.  Look, nothing shocks us anymore.  Not when there are mutant scumbags abducting little kids and serial killers barbecuing  hookers.  Not when there's O.J. and Scott Peterson.  Not when terrorist pigs fly jetliners into skyscrapers.  We've been shock-proofed.  And how many things can actually kill us? 
[04:23:00]  Well, according to the local TV news, sex.  Or not having sex.  Coffee can kill us, except when it's preventing fatal heart attacks.  Carpet cleaner, hand soap, golf clubs, old ladies suffering from dementia armed with  Uzis, and even revolving doors.  Hotel lobbies, enter at your own risk.  The shocking tale of a man trapped as the doors spun out of control.  So, thanks again, guys, for bringing the hammer down on these fear-mongers. 
[04:23:30]  Oh, and just one other thing.  Back on terrestrial radio, ONA cannot engage in the salty repartee that has distinguished  their satellite radio program.  In other words, the FCC will not allow two adults to use adult language.  But on this new and rarely listened to communications platform, yes, I speak of the audio blog.  Well, that operates outside the scope of the FCC. 
[04:24:00]  So, I can curse, and I have, and I will.  Opie, Anthony, to quote the great Neil Young himself, long may you fucking run.  If you'd like to comment on this or any of my other audio blogs or my on-air reporting,  you can reach me at montoneatwins.com.  Oh, ONA.  Be well.  ONA Pass.  John Montone, 1010, Wins News. 
[04:24:30]  I didn't know that was over.  I love that guy.  ONA Pass.  Give him a friendly email.  That guy's great.  And we meet friendly.  That was great.  Yeah, he really did.  That was really good.  The guy is so underutilized on Wins.  You could tell he's a creative guy, and he's got a good personality.  And it's very rare that you hear him doing any stories, unless they're, you know, kind  of those sideline little stories.  He's really, what a set of balls on him, too.  These podcasts, I'm sure, they, it is a little brave of him to go out on a limb like that 
[04:25:00]  and put stuff out like that when you're supposed to be, you know, the straight-up news guy.  You know what it is?  He's been reporting the news for so many years, you probably get sick of reading it  without being able to say terrorist pigs or these scumbags.  That's what they are.  And it's probably just refreshing to finally be able to speak your mind when you've had  to read it like emasculated.  Yeah.  Can we get John Montone in here to fill in for Jimmy when Jimmy has to do one of his things?  I don't know.  He's a little too much of a potty mouth.  We might have to calm him down. 
[04:25:30]  Calm down that John Montone.  All right, we're out of here.  Hey, I got a good email from my publisher.  Can I tell you what it is?  Yeah.  I have a sour stomach.  Let him rip.  Not you, Jimmy.  I suggested that we do, you know, you got a lot of truck drivers and whackbag.com and  stuff like that.  So I told them, let's do a road challenge.  Would they pay for me to send me on the road to all of your new cities for your new shows?  Would they fund it?  They just gave me an email and said, yep.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  We're going to do a Fat Smash Road Challenge for Opie and Anthony. 
[04:26:00]  What are the seven cities?  Oh, my God.  New York.  Boston, New York.  Boston.  Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Pittsburgh.  West Palm.  West Dallas.  West Palm and Dallas.  Philly.  Philadelphia.  And Boston.  Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  And Cleveland.  So we're going to do a challenge.  We're going to go to each city.  We're going to do a weigh-in like Celebrity Fit Club.  They're going to pay for it.  And then we're going to have a grand prize.  Where are you going to find a fatty in Pittsburgh?  You're going to finish your content. 
[04:26:30]  All you have to do, don't even get a hotel.  Just stop at the airport.  No, I'm serious.  We're going to do it.  Are you guys good with that?  And we may have a big announcement in the very near future as well.  What's the announcement, Opie?  An announcement we would not have been able to make if we didn't get this deal together recently.  What's the announcement?  That's called a tease, Jimmy.  But I don't know it.  As soon as I find out, we'll all know.  Anthony, what's the announcement?  By the way, the number one greatest metal song of all time.  Is Pal Talk still on?  Yeah.  Oh, they didn't see that. 
[04:27:00]  They didn't see that, Opie.  Got to hold it longer than that on Opant 2.  Let's see.  I can't see it.  Can't see it.  No, I can't.  No, it's blurry.  Pull back a little.  Back.  Back a little bit.  It's blurry.  Can't see it.  I can't.  Oh, Christ.  They got it.  All right, Michelle, what's up?  I have food for getting really bad gas.  Okay.  Dried apricots.  Dried apricots? 
[04:27:30]  That sounds like it rocks your colon.  Oh, my God.  I ate, I don't know how much of a pound container one night for dinner.  And I had gas all night.  My husband worked the night shift when he came home.  He wouldn't even come in the room.  It was that bad.  And he got pissed off at me. 
[04:28:00]  He wasn't, he wasn't, he wouldn't even come in the room.  It was that bad.  He got pissed off on me.  I thought she'd never hang up. 
[04:28:30]  Jesus Christ.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual.  Let me go be an empty show. </pre>
