<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed a triumphant return to terrestrial radio after a stint on XM Satellite Radio,  celebrated by Opie, Anthony (who was ill on his birthday), and Jimmy Norton, alongside the crew: Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock.  The return was framed as the "ONA virus" spreading across the nation.  The broadcast was plagued by persistent technical difficulties, mainly microphone issues and feedback.

A large portion focused on the return and reactions.  Don Imus called (with terrible connection), and they discussed the surprisingly positive response from Bill Donahue of the Catholic League, contrasting it with Howard Stern's allegation that they paid Donahue for a positive review.  They reminisced about their relationship with Imus.  Listener-designed "WOW" stickers were promoted, with a listener explaining the concept.  The move to CBS Radio was discussed with humorous anecdotes about interactions with CBS executives.  Their "pests," dedicated fans who harassed rivals, were a major topic, with Doug OutDoug calling in to explain their activities.  They also recounted retrieving their show materials from a "vault" at their old station.  WYSP promotional audio was played.

Joe Rogan called, discussing his show's ending and his upcoming appearance on Opie and Anthony.  They shared a humorous anecdote about a fake MySpace message to rapper Gangsta Fag. The show continued to celebrate their return. A subsequent segment heavily featured Joe Rogan's appearance, focusing on a humorous anecdote about Rogan's past altercation with skinheads,  his martial arts background, and his experiences in stand-up comedy and *Fear Factor*. Rogan discussed his substance use and evolving perspective on the show.

The hosts received gifts from a Philadelphia radio station (clothing, alcohol, etc.), with Jimmy Norton's comparatively meager gift (a t-shirt and Starbucks card) becoming a running joke.  The distribution of gifts turned into a humorous power struggle.  Listeners from Boston and Philadelphia called to discuss the return to terrestrial radio.  Bill Donahue called again, leading to a discussion of religious tolerance and political sensitivities in media. The new studio's features, including the potential for viewing people in nearby apartments, were discussed, along with anxieties about the hosts' behavior around women.


Earlier in the broadcast, (during their time on XM Satellite Radio), the show began with a discussion about double standards regarding freedom of speech and depictions of religious figures, particularly the Danish Muhammad cartoons.  Bill Donahue called to discuss this.  They then discussed their move to XM, mentioning technical issues with a prior Don Imus interview.  Nick Carter (Backstreet Boys) and David Hickley (*Daily News*) were in the studio.  Negative listener feedback was read.  Pugs and Kelly, from their former Dallas affiliate, called, reminiscing about past trips to Dallas (including Dealey Plaza) and a humorous anecdote about Opie inadvertently getting a massage parlor sponsor dropped.

A live segment showed Opie and Anthony walking from their old studio to the XM studio, with paparazzi present; this was suggested as a recurring segment.  Back in the studio, Bill Burr was revealed as a guest. They discussed the challenges of their first day on XM, including the change in studio and equipment and the numerous observers. More listener calls followed, some negative, some positive. Future plans, segments, and guests were discussed.  The show ended with reflections on the day and anticipation for future broadcasts.


Another segment discussed the hosts' and Jimmy Norton's appearances at Funny Bones comedy clubs, a fallout between Norton and Ben Sparks involving MySpace, Norton's less desirable time slot, and his purchase of a Boston Red Sox cap. A caller congratulated them on their XM return. Future stunts, including a Godfather-themed march to the studio, were discussed.  A New York Post photographer was in the studio, leading to jokes.  Jimmy Norton's recent physical exam, including a graphic account of his prostate exam, was detailed.

A critique of MTV's "Yo Mama" followed, with clips and discussion of its perceived lack of humor and reliance on racial stereotypes.  Bob from Connecticut debated the show's use of racial elements.  A significant portion involved Jimmy Norton's birthday cake, escalating pranks by No Filter Paul and others, culminating in a cake being thrown at Stalker Patty, breaking her glasses.  Patty's distress over the broken glasses led to more comedic ribbing and attempts to resolve the situation.  Rob Bartlett, impersonating Brian Wilson, commented on their terrestrial return.


A following segment centered on Patty's broken glasses, with increasingly absurd and vulgar pranks involving E-Rock pretending to break them, causing Patty to cry.  Schemes to return the glasses included mousetraps and bizarre challenges involving Jimmy Norton's genitals.  Patty was offered money to touch Jimmy Norton's penis with a glove, which she accepted.  Vulgar jokes and discussions of bodily functions abounded. A listener complained about their move to XM and perceived hypocrisy.  Additional listener calls and discussion of the "Patty" incident and reactions to the XM transition concluded this segment.


A later segment focused on the punishment of Paul, who wronged E-Rock.  Increasingly creative and violent methods were devised, culminating in stapling a "I am an asshole" sign to his leg.  The best staple placement and potential injury were debated, with a focus on the physical act of stapling.  After trial and error, including Anthony's physics lesson, they successfully stapled the sign.  Paul's appearance was also discussed.  Bill Burr joined as a guest, discussing upcoming shows, including a benefit for a friend's son with cancer.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned, and the segment ended with anticipation of a delayed gift for Jimmy from Caroline's Comedy Club due to Anthony's illness and departure.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. 
[00:00:30]  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. 
[00:01:00]  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton. 
[00:01:30]  Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Julian Donoghue, president of the Catholic League. 
[00:02:00]  We all screw up.  You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounce back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do?  Just sit around here and lambate Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people.  You know, I move on.  And, you know, I just wish you well.  I just wish you well.  Wish you well.  Wish you well.  Push the button!  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! 
[00:02:30]  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabbit radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless.  Worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped fat pig. 
[00:03:00]  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  We stare like Chuckie.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool can we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My car's just burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome.  The Opinette.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:03:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Don't you do it!  Don't you do it!  Don't you!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nothing else. 
[00:04:00]  What is that, audio from four years ago?  Uh, yeah.  Good morning and welcome to the Opinette Anthony program.  We call it the virus, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio, thanks to XM Satellite Radio, and now thanks to CBS Radio.  How great is that?  How great is that?  It's unbelievable, actually.  We're being heard on terrestrial radio this morning.  We're being heard in Boston on WBCN. 
[00:04:30]  We're being heard in Philly on WISP.  We're being heard in Cleveland on, on, uh...  That station.  That station in Cleveland.  Give him the paper, for God's sake.  Give me the paper.  Yes, I got it.  WNCX.  Huh?  XRK?  Yeah.  So why does it say WNCX?  Did we just promote the competition?  Also, Pittsburgh, WRKZ. 
[00:05:00]  West Palm Beach, WPBZ.  Dallas, WLLI.  The virus continues to spread across America.  Yeah, it's spread right over here to me.  Yeah, right off the bat, we gotta say, um, happy birthday to Anthony.  Thanks.  What a great birthday.  And we hope you start feeling well immediately.  It's only the biggest day of our radio careers, and Anthony walked in, bitching, complaining,  sneezing, watery eyes, scratchy throat. 
[00:05:30]  I don't get sick.  I don't get sick.  365 days out of the year.  I'm fine.  One day, this day, how important to our careers, the Opie and Anthony show, we're back.  Back under, yeah, thank you.  We're back, and listen to what I sound like.  Listen to this voice.  It is shot.  My voice is shot.  I slept for three hours. 
[00:06:00]  I've been sick all night.  Hey, welcome back.  Fantastic.  All right, people.  Can you believe I'm sick?  People, there's nothing to see here.  You might as well just go home.  Move along.  Move along.  Well, Anthony, Jimmy offered to, you know, rub your back and stuff.  He does that when I'm well.  Just a little knuckle.  It doesn't matter.  The knuckle walk down the spine.  It's not good.  You do that.  Will it feel good?  Yeah.  Keep going.  LOL.  So what?  You only slept like three hours?  Three hours of sleep. 
[00:06:30]  Because, you know, pretty excited.  That was just part of it, though.  The other part is not being able to breathe kind of puts a little damper on your sleep.  And then talking.  I've been so stressed out because radio people, I'll let you in on a little inside information about radio.  Talking is pretty important when you're in radio.  Since people can't see you, the talking part, pretty important.  If you can't talk, you can't do radio. 
[00:07:00]  And we got lots of radio.  Unbelievable.  Hey, we got Imus calling in like 10 minutes.  I would love to have done, you know, dueling Imuses.  I've been told I do a pretty good Imus impression.  That's out the window.  This is the only chance we'll have to talk to Imus.  You know that, right?  I know.  And it's going to be like this.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe I could do a sick Imus.  It's horrible, see?  I can't even do impressions.  That's what I do.  That's what I do, people.  That's what I do.  This is my impression of somebody with AIDS. 
[00:07:30]  That's pretty much what I'm doing right now.  Get me a tattered robe and some broth.  I'd do a good Charles McCord.  Maybe we could fly by on that.  Give it a whirl.  I'd do nobody.  Unbelievable that this day I have to be sick.  So I'm sending interns around like I'm wielding an iron sickly fist.  Well, you got everyone scared around here.  Usually, I am really Mr. Nice Guy.  Opie's the bastard out of everybody on this crew. 
[00:08:00]  Wait a minute.  You rule with an iron fist.  Why are you lashing out at me today?  To make myself feel better.  I must make others hurt.  I've gotten a lot better over the years.  I understand.  But remember now, we're talking to a lot of people that haven't hurt us in four years.  Right.  So they remember you as a real ass.  So they're probably not used to Nice Opie.  And it comes back from time to time.  My mic sounds really weird. 
[00:08:30]  Does it?  Yeah.  Well, you know, between this, we're going to have a few technical glitches.  It's going to have some getting used to.  I'm also heavily medicated.  Whoopee.  Why do you use a chloroceptic?  That stuff sucks.  It never works, dude.  Because when you cough, and it feels like you just coughed up a pin cushion, it kind  of soothes for two seconds.  I hate that stuff.  Yeah?  Then don't use it.  No, but I'm trying to say it's not going to help you get better.  Dr. Jimmy what?  It won't help.  Dr. Jim what?  I'm never sick. 
[00:09:00]  Never sick.  Anthony's never sick either.  Well, today he is.  I don't wear bags.  I know.  My body, my immune system is fantastic.  Believe me.  He is just the picture of health.  If what's getting pulled into my body isn't killing me, believe me, a cough has no shot.  My body laughs in a cough.  Okay.  Anthony equals loud.  Jimmy, and Opie, quiet.  Okay.  You can turn me down again.  That seems to be the instant feedback coming in.  All right.  We do our sound checks through the audience.  Isn't that great?  It could just be someone screwing around.  They can't hear me at all. 
[00:09:30]  Well, people got to bear with us.  We're testing out a new studio.  There's going to be some bugs and some adjustments that are made.  This mic sounds absolutely awful.  The other day, it sounded great.  And now it's going in and out, and it's really messing me up.  But we'll get through it, okay?  We'll go and get through this.  Keep your chin up.  So you got all your medication?  You ready to broadcast?  Almost.  It's all spread out.  I got a big thing of Robitussin and the chloroceptic.  I think I sent somebody out for some honey and lemon so I could put it in some hot water. 
[00:10:00]  Ugh.  I didn't envision it to be like this today.  You completely sick and miserable, yelling at everyone as soon as you arrived.  It's our first day.  Is that how I look?  Because if that's how I look on a daily basis, I'll stop.  When you're sick?  Or just in general, I'll stop bitching tomorrow.  Mm-mm.  And then I get Club Soda Candy picking me up.  And I don't know.  I just envisioned it to be different on this special day.  Yeah, we hoped. 
[00:10:30]  And I jump in his car and it smells like rotting eggs.  Why?  Because he had to do what he had to do all the way from Jersey to Manhattan.  Oh, he was a little nervous stomach.  And then I go, Kenny, what the F?  And he's like, does it smell bad?  He had nervous stomach.  He goes, I don't know it smells bad because I have allergies.  I'm like, great.  So I had to plug up my nose and open the window all the way down to the station today.  Yeah.  I envision, like, limos and a welcoming crew. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  You got this impression that it's – because it is a big day.  And I'm sick.  You have to drive in the stink mobile.  How are you doing, Jimmy?  I feel fine.  You have to realize they had to ask you guys, hey, look, would you care to do mornings?  That's like kicking a chick out and saying, you suck, I never want to see you again.  And all of a sudden go, look, just, you know, one more.  Would you mind just throwing me one more quick one?  That's what that's like.  So that's why there's no big welcoming crew.  What's in your bag? 
[00:11:30]  Like, I was hoping to get a little more help than just this.  Hey, stupid, do you have to just drop off a bag of fruit for the star?  Wait, what?  The star.  Stupid intern.  Wait, what?  I asked for honey and lemon so that somebody could mix it up with some hot water and stuff.  And he hands me a bag of lemon and honey.  Wow.  Jesus.  Thank you, Keith.  Could you mix me up a little toddy?  Oh, do I just sound like a whining baby girl today? 
[00:12:00]  You're sick.  Ladies and gentlemen that aren't familiar with this program, I am all man.  I am all man.  And now I just sound like a whining, crying little infant.  We should take that little honey and just squirt it all over your back and get over with.  Something I'm used to.  I noticed Steve grabbed the honey and ran out of here.  God knows what he's doing with it.  Back to his bear den.  Yeah.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Let's go to Jim in Connecticut.  Jim, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:12:30]  Hi, guys.  Hey, Jim.  Welcome back.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Anthony.  All the best for you.  Happy birthday.  Welcome back, guys.  All right, Jim.  Great birthday.  Hey, Jim.  It's not going to happen, sir.  I'm impossible to get, even after four years.  Awful accent.  People like to say, hey, Jim.  No, he didn't.  And then hang up on you.  So you're not going to be able to celebrate your birthday either, huh?  No.  No.  Not really.  It's not going to be a very happy birthday for me.  And I guess we should cancel Hannity and Combs tonight? 
[00:13:00]  I don't think it would sound very, very good.  I'd rather do it after the weekend.  Monday.  After I've convalesced.  All right.  You know, we've gotten enough press anyway.  We're fine for now.  It's been very, very exciting the last few days.  We've been going nonstop.  Maybe that's worn me down.  I think your immune system dropped a little bit because of all the energy that you had to put out.  It's traveling.  And you got sick.  Traveling does it.  You know what happened?  I wanted to dispel the myth because there's like this myth that I'm a germaphobe because I just don't like shaking clammy people's hands. 
[00:13:30]  And we went up to Boston.  Did an appearance.  And I wanted to dispel the myth so I shook a bunch of people's hands instead of just doing the fist punch thing.  And look at where I am.  Look what you did to me, Boston.  Thank you.  What a germy, germy city.  Wait a minute.  You were at Foxwoods, though.  Yeah.  That's another thing.  You handle a lot of chips.  You see people like wiping their nose and then you win their chips.  Ugh. 
[00:14:00]  It should just be disposable.  So I don't know what it is, whether it's traveling or the casino, but here I am.  I made it.  Whoopee.  I'm in whoopity-doo.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Virginia Beach.  Brian, what's going on today?  Good morning, boys, and welcome back to Terrestrial.  Hey, Brian.  Hey, I just want to let anybody who's not familiar with the show or maybe haven't heard you for a while that it's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  I don't know what's going on with the phones.  There's a little feedback. 
[00:14:30]  We got some feedback going on.  It could be an open headphone by a microphone, or it could be other things that we'll deal with.  Don't worry about it.  Actually, yes.  Now that we're back on Terrestrial Radio and all these fine cities, there's a lot of cities that know WOW.  And if you want to support the show, I do believe you've got to break out the old WOW stickers immediately.  If you don't have a WOW sticker, you might want to make a homemade WOW sign and get it on the car to support Opie and Anthony back on Terrestrial Radio.  Brian, explain WOW to the newbies out there. 
[00:15:00]  Well, Opie, thanks for asking.  WOW is a simple concept.  Just get a WOW sticker or make a WOW in your car.  If you don't have a WOW sticker, you might want to go to OpieandAnthony.com.  Not to be confused with EatABullet.com.  And then you slap it on your car, drive around, and maybe some lovely lady might, well, rip them out and show them off to you.  But maybe if you don't have the internet, you could always send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Opie and Anthony Show, 111 West 57th Street, Suite 500, New York, New York, 10019.  And you could get WOW stickers immediately. 
[00:15:30]  Very good, Brian.  You guys going to get any new ones with all the logos on them?  I do believe, yes.  Oh, yeah.  The cities we're on, and they're already making WOW stickers in the old factory.  The WOW's going to be like a half an inch tall or what?  You guys are everywhere now.  All right.  Hey, thanks, Brian.  Let's get the WOW's back on the cars and the trucks and stuff, okay?  Yeah, you still see some of them there on the vehicles.  Believe it or not, we've got to take our first break because we're trying to sync up with Don Imus.  We're going to talk to Imus when we get back. 
[00:16:00]  How's that sound?  Very cool.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  We're going to talk to Imus when we get back. 
[00:16:30]  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town.  The boys are back in town.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio and now CBS Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  And we couldn't be happier. 
[00:17:00]  Or more surprised.  Or more surprised.  Unfortunately, Anthony, very sick today on his birthday.  It's the biggest day of his professional career.  Isn't that great?  And I wind up getting AIDS.  I got the worst cold ever.  Don't say, yeah.  I need to program some stations or something.  We're listening in on Imus.  He does weddings and bar mitzvahs and stuff like that.  So where's ONA?  We're right here, Mr. Imus.  Anthony apparently doesn't feel well. 
[00:17:30]  I'm a mess.  First day, biggest day of my radio career.  Back on terrestrial radio.  And I don't know what the hell I caught.  What's the matter with us?  I got like a cold cough everything going on.  My voice is shot.  So, you know, I'm...  And 365 days a year.  And this has to be the day.  The first day back.  You could be throwing up and you'd still be better at what they had. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, this is a great position to start from, I got to tell you.  I don't know what CBS told you, but let me...  Because it's the same company.  Let me just tell you what the facts are.  All right, fill us in.  You can take a goat to a mosque.  There's nothing you can't do.  We kind of got that impression when we started talking to CBS.  Because we were like doing the old, you know, kiss ass with Les.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden he finally had to stop us and said,  Hey, hey, we don't want you to clean it up too much. 
[00:18:30]  We still need you guys edgy.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, all right.  Yeah, we were brushing it over like, oh, we've grown and we've learned and all that.  And they're like, well, you know, we kind of, we want you to keep the edge.  And I'm like, you sure you want to tell us that?  And then I started staring at Les really closely and he got really uncomfortable.  And he's like, what are you doing, Opie?  And I said, I'm just checking to see if it's true that you have Botox.  And he doesn't have the Botox, I'm proud to report. 
[00:19:00]  You know, our primary concern, mine and Brian Wilson, is here with us this morning.  Yes, Brian, hello.  How are you doing that, Opie?  Throwing your voice?  I didn't know you were ventriloquist.  Oh, yeah.  Brian Wilson thinks that I miss his Opie as well.  Brian, you're finally talking with the real Opie.  So our main concern is Elmo, Opie's brother in the big shirt scandal.  Oh, the big shirt scandal?  Well, we never got our XM t-shirts, but then we couldn't ever get XM. 
[00:19:30]  One of you guys sent me, or somebody sent me two radios, we couldn't figure out how to activate them.  Yeah, I don't know what happened with that.  As far as the t-shirts, we'll send you more, I guess.  You know, I drank your coffee this morning, or your brother's coffee.  Yeah, did you like it?  This is just wonderful.  I mean, we finally get to talk to Mr. Imus and we got like, you know, strange technical problems.  What kind of feedback going on? 
[00:20:00]  I hope you feel better, Anthony.  Well, good luck to you guys.  Thank you, Don.  Don, any advice before we go?  More Whiffleback Challenge.  I'm hoping Anthony here on the Amos program.  There you go, Zimus.  We were plagued with a little feedback there, weren't we?  Well, like I said, we're in a new studio.  We've got to figure it all out.  Yeah.  So just bear with us the next couple of days.  Zimus has been so cool to us ever since we got back on the air on XM. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  He's plugged us, worn shirts, you know.  Some of the crew has worn Opie and Anthony t-shirts and stuff.  And now that we're on CBS radio, he's plugged us.  He'll break into the middle of talking to one of the Washington press corps and just ask him,  hey, have you heard Opie and Anthony are back on terrestrial radio?  And the people are like, no, I haven't heard about this, like, out of nowhere.  Yeah, do we have that audio?  It's definitely giving us support, and we appreciate it, man. 
[00:21:00]  Why am I such a worm?  One of my favorite people ever is on the phone, and I just shut up and I say nothing.  You clammed up.  It was dug out dug.  I would have talked for 40 minutes.  It's Imus.  I can't even say hi.  I like you.  Well, we really couldn't get into much of anything because the feedback was a little strange.  I know, but that's my cowardice.  It has nothing to do with that.  I'm helping you out.  I just gave you an excuse, and you didn't go for it.  It's interesting with Imus, too, because when we first worked for CBS, you know, everyone  knows the story by now and what happened to us, but back in the day when we first came 
[00:21:30]  to New York, Anthony did a, and still does, a great Imus impression.  You won't hear it today.  And a great Howard Stern impression.  More than that.  And, you know, we goof on everyone, and we just, you know, make fun of everything, including  ourselves.  We probably make fun of ourselves more than anything.  Oh, yeah.  And at the same time, Anthony was doing his Imus impression and his Howard Stern impression.  One loved it, and one hated it.  One couldn't take a joke, and one took the joke. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  It was unbelievable to me, and that's where it all started with us and Howard Stern.  It really goes all the way back to Howard just can't taking a joke.  Yeah.  Where Anthony was talking about Howard Stern and how he had, you know, the Howie copter and  was flying out to the Hamptons.  Went out to the Hamptons every weekend.  And, you know, and actually the stuff you did with your Imus voice was brutal compared to  what you were doing, you know, as... 
[00:22:30]  All in good fun.  Oh, but it was more brutal.  Yeah, it was.  But he didn't care.  He could take a joke.  The guy knows how to take a joke.  Apparently, that interview sounded like Stephen Hawking, they're saying, and Opie sounded like  a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica.  So I guess we were having some feedback issues.  Some?  We're going to have to...  Oh, my God.  We're going to have to do that again, though.  That was our big get today.  Do you think Imus will ever, like, talk to us again?  No.  That was pretty much it. 
[00:23:00]  Because, you know, we've been doing radio, you know, for over a year and a half now.  And we've been trying to get him on our show for about a year and a half.  It finally happened today.  And we have technical problems.  Ah.  It happens.  The feedback was on Imus' end.  So they're the ones.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Go ahead, Steve.  Say it again.  The mic was off.  Feedback might have been on Imus' end because they fixed the feedback the first time we  took a call before.  Are you blaming Mr. Imus?  I'm not blaming Mr. Imus for anything. 
[00:23:30]  Steve is blaming Mr. Imus on the feedback on the phone.  I'm not blaming Mr. I'm sure Mr. Imus is flanked.  Sounds to me like you're saying they're riddled with incompetence.  Blame the show that's been there for years.  Exactly.  We're here for 15 minutes.  A fine-tuned machine.  I understand it might be a little bit hard to believe, but...  It's obviously us.  There's like five or six guys tweaking buttons right to the moment we went on the air today,  and you're going to blame Imus who's been broadcasting for 60 years?  I'm not blaming Imus for anything. 
[00:24:00]  I'm just saying there could be, you know, a bad link in the chain.  That's all.  Yeah.  Well, we need a good old radio battle anymore.  A couple of them.  We think Imus stinks now.  That's what Steve says, and I agree, Jimmy.  I didn't say that.  Steve.  Yes, you did.  Don't say that.  I didn't.  My goodness.  I didn't.  All right.  Let's be nice.  Also on the program today, we got Bill Donahue calling in?  Yeah, Bill's going to call in.  A little controversy there.  He made our comeback very, very easy, by the way, because when we started talking to 
[00:24:30]  CBS about this move to come back on terrestrial radio, there were a lot of people very, very  scared, and they thought that we were going to have a problem with the Catholic League,  and Bill Donahue came out and just did us the biggest favor ever.  Yeah.  A lot of people were nervous and worried.  It was perfect.  Really quick.  I mean, I'll just read the last paragraph.  To those who say you can't go home again, I say nonsense.  In the year and a half that Opie and Anthony have been on XM Satellite, not a single complaint 
[00:25:00]  has reached our office about anything they've said.  Indeed, when the two shock jocks were picked up by XM, their producer called one morning  and asked if I would go on the air with them.  Though I had some reservations, I said yes and was immediately put through.  It made it clear that they regretted the St. Patrick's stunt.  We mixed it up for a bit and had a great time.  In short, the Catholic League hopes Opie and Anthony have a great run on CBS radio.  A lot of people have either read this press release or heard us read it the other  day on our show. 
[00:25:30]  This is where it gets interesting.  Good old Howard Stern, who just wants us to stop talking about it, and that's his latest  thing, was claiming that we paid Bill Donahue to release this fine press release.  Yeah.  So we'll get into that today with Mr. Donahue.  That was possible.  We would have thrown him some money in August of 2002, don't you think?  No kidding.  A boatload.  No kidding.  Let's go to Tom in Philly.  Hey, Tom, what's going on? 
[00:26:00]  What's up, buddy?  How are you, buddy?  All right.  How you doing, man?  Good.  Congratulations over there.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Hour's turn, baby.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  You got us.  Donahue is a prick.  Anything else, Tom?  Tom, why do they hang up?  We love having them on the phone, and they hang up.  Boy, who saw that coming?  Ellis, what's up?  Hey, man.  You guys are sounding good on both the XM and the YSP. 
[00:26:30]  I wanted to say good morning to O.B., Jimmy, and B. Arthur.  I know.  Poor Anthony.  Damn it.  I am so pissed.  This reminds me of when we got back on radio after two and a half years, and we started  on satellite radio.  I had the flu worse than I've ever had the flu in my life.  Yeah.  And Anthony and I had to do all this press, and it was exciting times for us, and I was  miserable.  I don't even remember doing half the interviews, and you're going through the same thing today, 
[00:27:00]  unfortunately.  I heal quickly.  I'll be fine.  And it's just, like I said before, the voice thing just annoys the hell out of me, man.  You've got to take those vitamin C packs for a thousand milligrams.  No, stop it.  I'm telling you, they work.  What are they going to do?  Dude, I'm never sick.  They help fight holes.  It's a virus thing.  It's a little microbe that gets in you, and there's no vitamin C going to duke it out.  No, it's good.  They're good.  They help you.  I'm telling you, they get mineral, vitamin B, all that stuff.  It's going to pull a Jimmy Norton and run away from the fight. 
[00:27:30]  No.  The vitamin C.  I happen to be very healthy.  Hey, this is very interesting being back on Terrestrial Radio because all the radio stations  are starting to make their own special production and stuff for us, and so far, YSP in Philly  is leading the way.  They are so excited we're back.  The phones have been ringing off the hook down there.  I guess they're setting up stuff today.  Karen Buck and the gang are on their way from Philly.  Gee, I wonder what they're going to bring.  What's wrong with the Philly cheesesteak? 
[00:28:00]  It's just so cliche.  But they're so happy.  We get it.  They're so happy we're back in Philly.  We get it.  Your city's famous for the cheesesteak.  They're hack gifts.  It really is.  We'll have Gallagher bring them and smash them on the console.  We'll have a little contest.  Gee, if we were on in Buffalo, I wonder what they would bring.  Fat girls.  I was going to say, a fat girl in a sweatshirt with a mullet, also known as the Buffalo Betty. 
[00:28:30]  I guess we could start a competition.  Philly's coming today with gifts, so we want all the other cities that we're on in to send  their gifts.  Yeah.  New York hasn't given us anything yet.  They haven't given us anything.  What a job.  Oh, except the studio.  The studio.  That's not even done yet, by the way.  Philly bring cheesesteaks.  Buffalo could bring wings, and maybe New York just bring cheques.  We just want cheques.  It's like those dopey Super Bowl bets or World Series bets between cities. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, look at that.  Boston's going to wager some clam chowder.  Ugh.  It is hack.  Oh, we understand.  If they come in here with cheesesteaks, I am not even looking at them.  Oh, no.  The beauty of it is I will destroy the gifts in front of them and make them go away crying.  We can actually throw stuff against the walls until they put, like, the nice walls up in  here.  You know, stupid Philly, too.  Remember the time? 
[00:29:30]  First thing back.  Great.  Now we're getting into this whole Philly thing.  Remember the time we broadcasted at WISP and they had the...  Many times.  Each time an event.  Well, there was...  The monkey.  Yeah, there was one fine broadcast that involved a dead monkey, yes.  And a lady that kind of let someone else watch her baby in a stroller so she could take care  of one of our listeners in the parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, Philly has some great memories.  Yeah.  But remember when they had the Philly mascot come in? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Philly fanatic.  The Philly fanatic.  He smelled.  They don't wash those mascot suits.  I don't...  I think it's...  The mascot guy is probably in charge of the suit.  And what are you going to take to a laundromat?  The thing's huge.  You can't shove it in a washing machine.  So it stunk.  So YSP thought it would be a great idea to have the Philly fanatic come in and welcome  us to Philly.  It might have been our first time we went down there.  And again, it's radio and he doesn't talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm getting at.  So good old Tim Sabian brings in the Philly fanatic and the guy just kind of nods. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And then swallows Jimmy's head and all that dumb hack.  All the dumb stuff that on radio is nothing.  So we started kicking him so we'd make noise for the radio.  One in the gut and you heard the Philly fanatic go, oh, knock it off.  Philly fanatic should get cancer.  I despise...  What are they called?  Mascots.  Yeah.  Team mascots.  Mr. Met.  The big baseball head.  Kid with Down syndrome.  Mascot they have.  It's horrendous. 
[00:31:00]  Big fat skull wheeling out from the stupid bullpen.  All right.  Let's say hi to Herman in Pittsburgh.  Herman, what's up?  Hey, how are you, man?  What's happening, guys?  What's up?  Hey, you know what?  It's kind of funny that you're having all the problems in the studio.  And the reason why I'm saying that is because I remember when Ralph was sitting there, he  was talking about people trying to sabotage his show.  Unfortunately, when he left, he sabotaged the damn studio.  That's exactly what I was thinking.  Actually, we're broadcasting from kind of a warehouse situation here. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, that's the echo is the walls of bare sheetrock and there's no ceiling in.  These are supposed to be very acoustically sound, these studios.  And this is just nothing.  I think what they did was they took the ceiling down to make Anthony work harder.  Oh, for the air conditioning?  Yeah, just to remind you.  Remind me of where I could be right now?  Where you could be right now.  I guess they're going to put up the walls and the ceiling in the very near future.  When?  I don't know.  The ceiling next week and the walls in two weeks is what I hear. 
[00:32:00]  And then the echo will go away.  Yeah.  Because if you get off mic a little bit, it's like you're in a gymnasium.  We sound like one of those old oldies stations.  Yes.  All right.  So getting back to WISP, they're really, really aggressive.  They're really excited that we're back on terrestrial radio down there.  And they're doing all sorts of production already.  And I want to play a sample of that for everybody.  Okay.  WISP Philadelphia. 
[00:32:30]  Now with Opie and Anthony mornings.  Hi, we're back.  The toxic twins.  Toxic twins are back.  You know, the announcement's been out there for a while, but now we've got to make it official.  No one confirmed it on either side.  Well, the announcement is we are here.  We are taking over for David Lee Roth.  We're doing mornings here on 3FM.  We start the show on Wednesday.  Right.  That's when we start at 6 a.m. Eastern time.  We start at 6 a.m.  We go to 9 a.m. 
[00:33:00]  Here on 3FM.  We've got to say hi to everyone listening to us on WYSP.  It's been a long time.  Yeah.  And there's been a bunch of radio shows down there that have had a lot of fun because  we haven't been around.  Yep.  A lot of fun.  We got beat up.  We did.  We got beat up for a few years where we were off the air.  And then when we first got on satellite, we were being beat up.  A lot of people, a lot of jobs, making a lot of fun of us, Opie.  And we've been keeping notes. 
[00:33:30]  Trust me.  Yes.  And it's going to get ugly right away.  It's called Slow Sicilian Revenge.  Look how long this took.  They had one show had an Opie and Anthony convert line.  Yeah.  You know, they're not.  So you might as well listen to us.  Type, oh, trust me.  We got all the notes and we're ready to rock and roll.  Yes.  It's going to get really interesting.  My friend.  So a big hi to everyone listening on WYSP in Philly.  Philly's been great to us over the years.  And we couldn't be happier that we're back on in Philly.  And we'll absolutely drop in on Philly. 
[00:34:00]  All smiles.  Brand new.  We're back.  Right.  We're back on terrestrial radio.  What a great, great opportunity.  It's a dream come true for all of us, for Jimmy Norton and Anthony and myself.  It's a dream come true.  The Opie and Anthony Show, starting tomorrow at 6 a.m.  Free FM, 94.1 WYSP.  All right.  That was pretty cool.  It's more of a montage.  And I got to, before I forget, I got to remind Philly, too, because I did something for YSP  called Babe Fest with Gene Simmons hosted. 
[00:34:30]  And I was one of the judges in Florentine was.  It was like a year ago.  And they have audio that we have to get.  Why?  Because I had a whole thing with Gene and this fan, let's just say, interrupted the festivities.  And they have the audio, which I have not been able to get.  Oh, wow.  Well, have them send it up.  Yeah.  Our buddy Jimmy Norton here is a celebrity whore.  Yes.  He just, he lives to get photographs with celebrities.  And when they turn him down, he takes it very, very personally.  Yeah.  And one time Gene, his hero, Gene Simmons, turned him down. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  One time in Vegas.  It was after we had interviewed him two weeks later and whatever.  We had a whole thing.  So I screamed about it on the air.  And one of the fans took it very personally.  And when he finally had a chance in front of 3,000 people to call Gene out, he did.  And I was mortified.  So I have, uh...  Why didn't you take a picture with little Jimmy?  Oh, it was awful.  And he's just like, what?  What?  Like he knows what the guy's talking about?  I have to get the audio.  And this was live on YSP?  No, YSP.  I had hosted Babe Fest. 
[00:35:30]  And then the next year, they got Simmons to host it.  And they asked me to be a judge.  3,000 people at the electric factory in Philadelphia.  And they're like, um...  Uh, you know, you and a bunch of guys will vote for the girls or whatever you do.  And so Gene comes out to say his hello.  And there's like some, uh...  Whole thing happening in the audience.  So Gene calls this kid up on stage because he was filming for his reality show.  He thought the kid was a kiss fanatic.  And the kid's like running and tries to jump up on the stage.  But he smashes into these, uh...  Lights around the stage.  And he breaks them.  He should have been bludgeoned by security.  No, no.  Gene called him up. 
[00:36:00]  Because Gene saw something going on.  So the guy walks up on stage.  And Gene goes, well, do you want to be on TV?  And the guy grabs the mic from Gene.  And he goes, I want to know why you wouldn't take a picture with little Jimmy Norton.  And Gene's like, what?  And I'm like, dude, it's okay.  It's okay.  We talked about it backstage.  And Gene's like, this is a major problem.  He realized something was going wrong in front of 3,000 people.  So he took a photo and he hugged me.  In front of 3,000 people?  Yeah.  I have a photo with him.  He hugged me.  He pulled a leg around me.  And it was kind of, you know, child...  Homoerotic.  In a way, yeah.  He's 6'5", so his, you know, hog was right in my chest. 
[00:36:30]  We got to get that audio.  There's a video of it, too.  You know, the best...  One of the great things about doing this deal with CBS Radio, one day, and hopefully very,  very soon, they're going to give us back our book of bits.  The library.  The library.  When we were at WNEW and syndicated across America, and then we screwed up with the whole,  you know, church thing.  I bet some volumes will be missing.  You think?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I bet a few things will be missing, like, this will not be played. 
[00:37:00]  You know, I learned something that there is, like, an office or something that's kind  of like a safe.  The vault, yeah.  A vault, and that's where all this stuff goes.  When they fire jocks and stuff, they have to take all their crap.  All their stuff goes in there.  It goes into this vault.  And supposedly, our book of bits is in the vault.  And I'm looking forward to the day, and I hope it's sometime this week that Tom Chiasana  walks in and hands over the book of Opie and Anthony bits. 
[00:37:30]  And then we get to start playing those again as well.  It's a great day for this radio program.  I want to try one more piece of production from WYSP.  Hey, that's pretty cool. 
[00:38:00]  They're making this show sound very exciting.  Yeah, I know.  On a sick day.  On a sick day for Anthony.  Damn it.  On any other day, you would have taken today off.  Please.  Any day.  This is take-off sick.  But, you know, your first day, what are you going to do?  I can't come in today.  Yeah, best of for that one-hour thing we did.  Yeah.  Replay the same nonsense four times. 
[00:38:30]  Here's your morning show.  Before we move on from Philly, I guess they're on their way with some gifts for us, and we'll say hi to them in a little while.  I guess the ratings come out today.  Oh, yeah.  Do they come out for Philly as well?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think they come out for New York.  Oh, you used to know all those things back in the old days.  I know.  I got to re-educate myself.  I know the ratings come in for New York, and it's just going to be a disaster for the stage.  Yeah, let's be honest.  And I guess Steve and Preston are going to have a fine book in Philly, and I'm already hearing that YSP is sending them flowers today and congratulating them on their last good book. 
[00:39:00]  The last good book.  Their last good book.  Hope you enjoyed it.  Well, there's some frustration there.  I guess really fast, they're telling us we have to break, but our old producer, when we got fired, went to work for Steve and Preston down there in Philly.  Yeah.  And that was great.  That was great for Rick, our old producer. 
[00:39:30]  He gets a gig.  He gets to get his life back in order while Anthony and I were just kind of – I was wandering around the country, and Anthony was –  Playing video games locked in my house.  Yeah, with the shades down for two and a half years.  Pretty much it.  And Rick goes down there pretty much with all our bits.  Yeah.  With all our bits.  Hey, this is a good one.  With all our bits and implemented them on the Steve and Preston show.  Yeah.  And then he leaves for another gig, and then eventually he wrote the Tsunami song. 
[00:40:00]  Might remember a little number called the Tsunami song.  Oops.  But Steve and Preston have no idea how many of our bits they're doing right now.  Yeah.  We'll get into the whole thing.  Care of Rick.  We'll get into the whole love you, hate you line.  That's just like the FU line.  And, Phil, you have no idea.  We have what's called pests.  We have something called pests.  The O&A pests.  Yep.  And I do believe they will be making Steve and Preston's lives a living hell. 
[00:40:30]  They're awful, awful people that are fans of this show that will do anything.  It's beyond any kind of wacky radial army.  They are legitimate pests.  They are annoying.  And once they latch on to something, they don't let go.  They're horrid people.  They're just miserable, jobless animals.  They've turned things around for us.  All they do is call people.  They get things done better than anyone that works for the show, including me.  We were taking off DirecTV for a while.  Ooh, the pests got on that. 
[00:41:00]  Over, Johnny.  Back on.  We got back on.  I guess we start back on DirecTV today as well.  And we got to thank the O&A pest for getting that done.  Yeah.  The press release is hilarious.  Do we have the press release?  Or we'll read that a little later.  What's going on?  We got to take a break?  All right.  We're going to take a break.  So hopefully Philly will be here soon with our gifts.  Surprise.  Ooh, I wonder.  Ooh.  Bread, meat, cheese.  Exactly.  All right.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:41:30]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  And we thank CBS today.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you for understanding.  Thank you for giving.  Oh, who are we kidding?  They didn't have a choice.  Yeah, pretty much the only game in town.  They didn't have a choice.  We got to go right to the phones and say hi to Doug OutDoug, a faithful listener of 
[00:42:00]  the Opie and Anthony program and a true O&A pest.  Good morning, gentlemen.  I figured I'd give a little bit more of a background for the pests since we really would  enjoy enlisting as many pests as possible from the new FM stations.  Okay.  Basically, what we do is we pester, just like Opie was saying before.  And I'm going to keep this clean for radio.  Thank you.  We go out there as we find people that have been bashing or talking about the Opie and 
[00:42:30]  Anthony show, stealing bits without giving credit.  And we take these big jerk faces.  Ooh.  Hey, watch that language.  Poopy-headed, apple-faced phonies.  And we relentlessly call their show, take their phones away.  Because most of these shows, they can't do a show without talking to people nonstop with  people bringing them material. 
[00:43:00]  We smash their message boards.  We bring them to their knees to the point where they melt down, sometimes a week, two  weeks at a time.  You guys may remember Scott Farrell.  Scott Farrell, the backstabbing, monkey-faced, stupid head.  Whoa.  He's trying.  Wait, I got to jump in here for a second.  Because, you know, a lot of our really hardcore fans kind of bitching and complaining that  we're going back to terrestrial radio, right? 
[00:43:30]  Because we can't curse.  That's so obvious.  You can't curse when you're on terrestrial radio.  Certain rules must be abided by.  See, instead of like, you know, being all bummed out about that, you got to turn it into a positive  like dugout Doug is.  Like Doug is.  And I'm loving the brand new curses that we're coming up with and the brand new insults.  Those are awful curses.  I don't know.  It's a little harsh, though.  It really is.  All right.  Continue, Doug.  I learned this from the insult rooms on Pal Talk.  Yes.  Anthony, you remember those.  Of course I do.  All right.  Continue.  But basically, a guy like Scott Farrell, who stabbed the boys in the back in the ultimate 
[00:44:00]  manner, we have had control of his show on the Little Doggy Company for a good month.  Now, we took a week off.  What I want you new pests to do is to hit the pest message boards on the internet.  That would be your whackbag.com, your fullblownaids.com.  Would that be your website, sir?  Actually, you know what?  Fullblownaids.com is indeed my website. 
[00:44:30]  And we do have a library of all the attack audio if you want to listen to it and figure  out what it is we do.  Yeah, we have taken this whole thing to a new level.  We really have some poor fella has AIDS and wants to get some help on the internet and  puts in full-blown AIDS and goes to this degenerate site.  Doug out, Doug.  Thinks it's medication advice.  It's a bunch of dumbbells calling a radio show.  And all those websites are linked to our website.  What are pests?  Steve, all the websites are linked to our website, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yes, they're all linked up.  Good old opianthony.com.  Okay.  We need new people.  All right.  And you're going to get them, Doug.  Trust me.  You're going to get them.  I think the pests need to start taking a look, taking a peek at Steve and Preston.  We've already got the link up on full-blown AIDS.  We've got the phone numbers for the studios.  We're already doing our homework.  We're going to have fun with Preston and Steve.  Oh, it's Preston and Steve or Steve and Preston?  I've got to find the cough button.  I don't even know. 
[00:45:30]  I think it's Preston.  Ah, whatever.  You know what?  It's gotten to the point.  I just sit back in command.  All right.  And by the way, congratulations to the ONA pest.  They got something done in the last week or so.  DirecTV has put us back up on their service.  This is huge.  And I'm sure you guys are proudly displaying the DirecTV quote that talks about the Opie and Anthony fan.  Just the latest in the line of victories for the pest.  Some of you out there may be laughing and chuckling, going, what do these guys think? 
[00:46:00]  We really are truly the most powerful force in radio today.  Doug, people are calling you a nervous Nelly, saying you're breathing all heavy and shaking.  Are you nervous being on FM?  I don't want to swear.  And I'm standing outside, so it's actually wind.  It's not my breath.  I think this has been a terrific phone call, especially with all the brand new curses and put-downs.  Doug's a little scared.  He's scared.  He's a little frightened.  We're all a little scared.  We've been doing radio for 18 months.  We've been back.  It is nerve-wracking. 
[00:46:30]  And I feel like I'm on college radio for the first time.  I'm not nervous.  You're not nervous, Jimmy?  No.  Yeah, I've got to be honest with everybody.  We've been doing radio for years, going into XM, doing radio.  And then we come in here, and all of a sudden I feel like all nervous again.  A little nervous Nelly.  You have got to disconnect from life for the time we're here, Opie.  Yeah, hello. 
[00:47:00]  Opie's on the phone, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I almost just cursed.  See, Opie was also on the phone yesterday.  We had a very important meeting with the lawyers for CBS, management, a bunch of very important  people.  And every five minutes or so, you'd hear that jazzy little tune coming out of Opie's cell  phone.  That thing is awful.  It looks like something you flush.  It's called the pebble?  It is. 
[00:47:30]  No.  And I'm looking to endorse the pebble.  This is the pebble.  Well, the pebble is great.  If you like a Who concert blaring out in the middle of a meeting, I wanted to smash that  phone.  And then he tries to hide it.  He puts it under a knapsack.  Yeah, that worked.  An empty knapsack, which did nothing but make it harder to get to when it rang again.  You know what's bad, Opie?  You're not known as like the technology guy.  So you get very excited when you get new technology.  And the pebble, new technology, very good.  It's not really new technology, just a new cool phone. 
[00:48:00]  In six months, dude.  Done.  Oh, I understand.  Done.  I understand.  I'll have this pebble for five years.  Yeah, exactly.  And you'll be going, dude, the pebble.  Have you heard about the pebble?  Yeah.  That's great.  Dude, Victrola.  It's a great thing.  Plays hot wax.  Hey, it's not about me.  Doug, anything else?  I hate the pebble.  That's about it.  Thank you very much for allowing me to play the best thing.  If you guys, if you're listening out there and you enjoyed playing Ring and Run when you  were 10, this is just like doing it when you're 30. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  Here's the deal.  Just go to opianthony.com for all the fine websites, especially the new people out there  that want to get involved with the show.  And I got to read this.  I got to give the Pest some credit today or they will eat us alive.  There's a press release from DirecTV.  We're back on there.  They wanted to go to just all music channels.  And then the One Pest attacked them, got really pissed off.  And in the press release, this is what is written.  Very proud.  The uproar from fans pleading with us to put Opie and Anthony back in the air was deafening 
[00:49:00]  to say the least, said Dan Fawcett, Executive Vice President, Programming Acquisition, DirecTV,  Inc.  There must be a long nameplate on his desk.  And though our original intent was to focus our XM service on more music, we now understand  the passionate following that Opie and Anthony have, and we're happy to bring them back on  board in an expanded format.  This is like, it's like 1941 in Germany.  And they're like, we are going to bring back Third Reich Radio. 
[00:49:30]  We never realized how popular these fellas were.  Just like it, Jim.  They just bullied them.  They really did.  That's great.  Brown shirts.  It's terrific.  Let's say hi to Joe Rogan.  Joe.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Here he is.  Hey, aren't you coming in to do our show Friday?  Yes, I'm coming in on Friday, man.  I'm excited.  I'm hoping I won't swear, though.  Yeah, that's kind of the tightrope we've been walking here for the past, well, how long  have we been on?  About an hour?  I mean, I'm so happy for you guys. 
[00:50:00]  It's really phenomenal.  I'm just, it just sucks that I can't, you can't go off.  But we will be able to go off between 9 and 11.  Is that how it goes?  Yeah.  We're basically doing two radio shows a day now.  That's phenomenal.  Yeah, you're not much of a potty mouth, though, Joe.  I know.  I try to keep it clean.  Joe is the worst.  Joe is the worst.  Yeah, I really have a problem.  Are you still shooting your television program? 
[00:50:30]  No.  The television program is probably officially done.  It airs again June, July, and August.  But most of it's pretty much done.  How many years has that been on?  Six.  Jesus.  Wow, what happened?  It's enough, you know?  I think it's just ran the course.  You know, the ratings are terrible this year.  Really?  Yeah, you know, people get tired of it.  And I'm completely, I really don't want to do it anymore.  I just want to do stand-up.  If they keep giving me money, I'll keep doing it, you know? 
[00:51:00]  Because it's too much money to pass up on, but I don't really want to do it anymore.  I haven't wanted to do it for years.  I think the internet ruined it, too.  The internet ruins everything.  The internet ruined it?  Yeah, you just go to the internet, you see whatever you want.  It's like, oh, somebody eating something weird or, you know, doing some kind of weird stunt.  Eh.  Yeah, well, there's definitely more exciting things.  They did a good job of, like, keeping it fresh and everything.  But at the end of the day, it's just a stupid game show.  Didn't you guys stop eating stuff?  No, they did it less.  You know, they're always, like, trying to dance around the advertisers. 
[00:51:30]  The advertisers would get mad if we, like...  We fed them a horse, wrecked them once, and, like, we lost, like, 50 advertisers.  Bud Weiser, all these people pulled out, you know, because they were just disgusted.  So we tried to do less of that, but...  Yeah.  Well, if you wanted...  You should...  There's a fine horse video on the internet that I can think of where a gentleman died.  See?  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  People would rather tune into that.  But that video wasn't sponsored by anybody.  Nope.  I think that's the point Joe's making.  It should have been sponsored by...  That video is removed from my website. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  It should have been sponsored by Budweiser.  It was like a Clydesdale.  Play some Christmas music and watch that guy's intestines be loosened.  Fantastic.  I'm going to interview Gangsta Fag.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I'm supposed to meet that guy.  I'm terrified, though, because he's, like, 6'4", 240 pounds.  Wow, he's huge.  He's a big, giant, homo.  He's very scary.  This is the dilemma we have going back to Terrestrial Radio.  Do we do the Gangsta Fag over here, or do we do it over there? 
[00:52:30]  A little of both.  Well, the songs are really dirty now that I think about it.  Yeah.  It's pretty hard, even content-wise, to get away with the stuff he's talking about.  I think it'd be actually funny to play it on Terrestrial and just have, like, beat, beat.  And then just, like, it gets beeps for 30 seconds, and then beat, beat.  Run from the beep.  Run from the beep.  Yeah, he's a very scary guy.  Someone sold me out with him.  Oh, we haven't talked to Joe Rogan about this.  Yeah, he's got a MySpace account. 
[00:53:00]  Gangsta Fag does?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And for the newbies, it's a guy that does hardcore rap, but he happens to be a gay black gentleman.  He's a big black gay guy that does gangster rap.  And brands about banging dudes.  Yeah, instead of talking about, like, broads, he talks about guys.  It's hilarious.  And somebody had a fake MySpace account under my name and messaged Gangsta Fag that I wanted to hook up with him.  And he wrote this very apologetic letter that he didn't want to be with me. 
[00:53:30]  I was insulted, kind of.  Like, I appreciate you playing my music, but I'm, no.  Yeah, I was kind of insulted.  Not even for plugs.  No.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Were you kind of bummed, Anthony, just a little bit?  Not because you're gay, but that you got rejected.  Choosy Fag.  You got rejected by a guy who rapes other guys in jail.  I know.  No, I'd prefer not to.  Right.  Who would pretty much do it.  Yeah, he's rapping about, like, one of his songs, I guess some southern skinheads beat up one of his friends. 
[00:54:00]  And he goes to the bar that the southern skinheads are hanging out at, waits at the back door, beats him over the head with baseball bats, and then proceeds to have their way with these hillbillies.  And he won't do me.  I just...  You got to admit, it hurts a little.  You know...  It hurts a little.  I was a little put off.  A little bummed out.  You know, there's your slender, and I bet he tends to like a fatter-bottomed boy. 
[00:54:30]  Do you think that's it?  He might just have a type, you know?  You never know.  You know something, truthfully?  I was so happy.  You were relieved.  Oh, my God, was I relieved.  Because who knows?  He's a big guy, and you're going to say no?  If he grabs you somewhere, you know, maybe you're going into the restroom, and he decides he wants to have his way with you, what are you going to say?  Excuse me, huge gentleman.  Down, Kong.  You're not going to say anything.  Here's what you're going to say.  Yeah, I can't wait to meet. 
[00:55:00]  Dude, it's going to be quite interesting.  But I'm bringing a couple people with me.  I'm not going solo.  Well, Joe, we all know you know how to kick ass.  Yeah, well, you know what?  Size matters.  That's a big dude.  Yeah.  I think you put him down, though, with some of your martial arts.  I've seen you on the Ultimate Fighting.  You sound like you know what you're talking about.  Yeah, I sound like I know what I'm talking about.  There's a big difference between that and being able to take out a gigantic homo.  When was the last time you beat the crap out of someone?  You mean in the gym?  No, I mean just like somebody giving you a little crap. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, it's been a long time since high school.  Really?  Yeah.  No one screws with you, though.  That's what it is.  Like, they kind of know you well enough to know to leave you alone.  Sometimes people do.  You know what?  I'm pretty good at avoiding stuff.  And, you know, people can say whatever they want.  They're not going to cause me to fight.  The only way I would fight is if I was really worried that my health was in danger or somebody I knew was in danger.  Yeah.  A lot of times you can get out of there before it gets up.  Rogan's also the funny guy, which is weird.  Like, I always had to be the funny guy because I wasn't the big guy. 
[00:56:00]  So I never got my ass beat in school or anything because I was always like, everybody kind of liked me.  I was funny in school.  Well, that explains why I got my ass kicked in high school a lot.  Really?  Oh, God.  I became funny for a different reason.  I became funny because I used to fight a lot in these martial arts tournaments and boxing tournaments.  And we used to go travel together on these trips and everybody would be nervous.  It was like gallows humor.  So I would just crack everybody up to kind of lighten up the mood because everybody was, like, really nervous. 
[00:56:30]  We were going to fight in these full contact tournaments and someone else would get knocked out and stuff.  It was pretty great.  Would you travel with the people you would actually fight?  No, no, no.  I'd travel with the team that I was on.  That's a little awkward.  Yeah.  Kick someone's ass and they're sitting right next to you.  Hey, how's that arm?  Guys in a neck brace.  Hey, sorry about that hole.  You'll never walk again thing.  No, you know, just travel with the guys that I used to work out with.  And they're the ones who actually talked me into doing stand-up in the first place.  I got to tell you, I saw Joe Rogan in L.A. a bunch of times.  His stand-up is unbelievable. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, it kills.  If I didn't know me, I would think I probably sucked.  No, you're a thinking man.  You saw me on TV and you're like, you know, you saw Fear of Fact.  You're like, how does that ass clown funny?  No, you're a thinking man's comedian and it's obvious that you smoke a lot of pot.  Yeah.  It was obvious on the show.  Hey, did you have a wind of the show not being picked up on the last season?  Well, you mean why?  Did I look more high last season?  You kind of looked more high and you looked like you really could care less.  I really could care less.  Like, I started getting high season two. 
[00:57:30]  If you watch the repeats, it looked like season one is like, it looks normal.  Season two, it looks normal until about episode 12.  And I was like, all right, screw this.  Yeah, you would like really interview the people and get into their persona and stuff before they would do the stunts.  And then last season I was watching, like there'd be some chick and she's got to jump off of this raft that's being pulled by a speedboat.  And she'd do it and she'd come back and you'd just be like, that was something, huh?  Like, no info. 
[00:58:00]  Last time I saw Rogan, he's standing at the comedy store just licking a pot lollipop while some 65-year-old woman fawned over him.  Ah, dream come true.  That's a Pauly Shore's best friend's mom.  Oh, it was hilarious.  That was bizarre.  How about that girl that I was with?  We were sitting there talking and me and Jim are having this conversation about quantum physics.  We're talking about, what is that guy's name?  Professor Haku, is that his name?  Michio Haku, he actually lives in my building, yeah.  We're talking about him, we're talking about, like, quantum theory and all this crazy stuff. 
[00:58:30]  And this chick I'm with goes, I like waffles.  Oh, great.  Absolutely true.  She was a 10.  I would have seen that in the movie.  And you turned and laughed and gave her all the attention she needed.  Yeah, not waffles are good.  Yeah, because she's pretty.  An ugly chick, you'd have told her, shut up.  Yeah, fat chick, of course you'd say, well, of course you like waffles, pig.  Two men are talking.  Yeah, it was a classic moment.  Let's demonstrate gravity with your fat ass.  Well, Joe, we're going to see you on Friday. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, I'm very much looking forward to coming back.  I'm doing the Borgata in Atlantic City on Friday night.  So I'm coming in to just hang out with you guys.  That's the only reason I'm coming to New York.  Are you doing the, what are you doing, the music box?  Yeah, yeah.  Cool, man.  Do you got ticket info?  I know that Borgata.com, because I'm actually doing it with Hotel in May.  So if you want to go, go to the Borgata.com if you want tickets for that.  Yes, that's it.  All right.  Joe, we'll see you on Friday. 
[00:59:30]  Thank you very much.  I'll see you Friday.  Bye, sweetie.  Thanks for calling us on our first day.  We appreciate it.  Congratulations, man.  You guys deserve everything you're getting.  This is fantastic.  Thanks, Joe.  That's awesome.  See you Friday.  All right, Joe.  So let's say hi to Anthony in Boston.  Anthony, what's going on?  I'm driving work, guys.  Welcome back to Boston.  Thank you, sir.  Third time's a charm.  It's about time.  It's funny.  They're writing a lot of articles about us returning to Boston Radio, and they keep trying  to get a comment from the mayor.  That's the big thing up there.  And so far. 
[01:00:00]  He told me to pass along a comment for you.  Oh, yeah?  What's that?  Oh, that old gag.  He's a translator.  Yes, he seems to have a very large tongue, doesn't he?  Yes, he does.  We were on the front page of the Boston Herald yesterday.  Yeah, I saw it.  And then inside it had that the mayor had no comment on our return to Boston Radio.  Yeah, he doesn't want to give us any publicity.  All right, Anthony.  Thanks for the call.  Hey, thank you, guys.  Okay. 
[01:00:30]  All right, bye.  We got representation from WISP calling in to say hi to us today.  It's Gil.  Gil.  What's up, Gil?  Hell, yeah.  Yeah, here we go.  Bring it on, baby.  We're off.  So what's the vibe in Philly, Gil?  It's enormous.  Yeah?  It's absolutely massive.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a big deal.  This is a big deal.  We're very excited.  Congratulations.  He sounds it.  Yeah.  Very excited.  Congratulations. 
[01:01:00]  No, this is great, man.  No, this is the biggest thing that happened to us since you guys left.  Yeah, and that was pretty big.  Hey, we got some lovely ladies from Philly that just walked in as we have you on the phone  there, Gil.  I remember you.  I remember you.  Lovely Tanya.  Did she walk in?  Yes, she did.  Remember Tanya?  Of course we remember Tanya.  And Diane.  Diane.  Hi.  And they're going to hand out the gifts, Gil.  This should be very exciting radio. 
[01:01:30]  All right, so who asked for the cheesesteaks?  Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  I want, like, a little bite or something, but I really shouldn't try to not, like...  There's five of them.  There's five chilies.  The way that sounds...  Yeah, you're right.  What a fag I'm turning into.  Oh, I really shouldn't.  I really shouldn't.  It goes right to my thighs.  I should be turned on my stomach and have it pounded into me with a mallet.  You have absolutely no willpower.  No, I do, actually.  You're supposed to be on the...  No, no.  I didn't want the fat...  I had chicken yesterday.  The Fat Smash Diet or whatever it's called from Dr. Ian Smith.  No, if I was on the... 
[01:02:00]  The reason I'm not on the Fat Smash Diet is because I didn't have vegetables at home  yesterday, so I ordered grilled chicken.  I have very good willpower.  But that was the same excuse you used on Monday, I think.  I still don't have vegetables.  Once I get them, I'll be okay.  Then you'll start officially?  Believe me, if I didn't have willpower, I wouldn't even have made it in today.  I'd still be home right now acting on my sexual addiction.  I went to bed at midnight last night to be a positive contributor to this nightmare.  No one got sleep last night.  All right.  Anthony's going to get the first package.  Oh, what is this?  Let's see. 
[01:02:30]  Lots of stuff that he will not wear.  Oh, wow.  Clothes.  No, I...  Just...  Admit it, Anthony.  It's a bottle of...  Oh.  Hanger One Vodka.  Cool.  Here we go.  I could use this right now.  All right.  You got some vodka.  The bottle's a perfect shape, too.  Nice and long neck.  Anthony, did I hear right?  It's your birthday today.  That's what they tell me.  Can I ask how old you are?  Yeah, you can ask, all right. 
[01:03:00]  Whenever someone asks me how old I am, I have this really funny joke I do.  Go ahead, ask me how old I am.  How old are you, Jenny?  29 again.  You know, it just kind of gets everybody laughing.  It's a...  Oh, and a YSP pullover just in time for summer.  That's cool.  Good.  I guess the spring stuff hasn't come in yet.  Good.  Wow.  They expect us to actually be working for them when the weather gets cold again. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, free FM heating pad.  You never know.  Yes.  You never know with us.  There's some earmuffs in there, too.  Thank you very much.  And a Flyers jersey right in time for playoffs.  Oh, yeah, okay.  You have the same thing, Opie, so just don't be too excited.  No, actually, my Islanders are out of the playoffs, so...  You own them now, isn't it?  So I'll give this Philly jersey to Big Ken and the gang down there in Philly.  Is this my gift?  Yeah, you get a gift, too.  No, no, no. 
[01:04:00]  You got to open the car.  You have to open it.  Wait, we got to explain.  Everybody else got packages.  Anthony and I got a pile of stuff in front of us.  I got a Philly's T-shirt, a Philly's hat, the Flyers jersey, and the YSP pullover, and  a nice bottle of wine.  Anthony got a pile of stuff, and they just handed Jimmy his...  I got a free FM T-shirt.  And an envelope.  Open the envelope.  Is there a prostitute in it?  Yes, open it.  If they got you a gift certificate for a massage, I will laugh really hard. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe.  Maybe.  They got me a Starbucks...  A $50 Starbucks gift card.  Well, you don't drink.  But I do wear sweatshirts.  What, do I not get cold, either?  How do I not get a free FM sweatshirt?  That's saying you're lacking energy on the program.  I need caffeine.  Jimmy.  Here you go.  No, I can't.  Oh, wow.  Nope, can't do it.  No, no, no.  I got my T-shirt.  Thanks.  Thank you.  We can mail you one. 
[01:05:00]  No, I don't want it.  People have got to start realizing that Jim Norton is a massive part of this radio show.  Yeah.  The press may believe he didn't even exist.  No respect.  That's all right.  Only one article mentioned his name, and you got a T-shirt today.  Wait, shoot this.  And a Starbucks card.  Huh?  All right, they're shooting the...  Free FM T-shirt.  Free FM T-shirt, yes.  If there's any homeless people out there that lack toilet paper, I now have an extra large  for you.  Why can't you accept the gift?  They've been driving all night. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I love it.  With a little honor.  What time do you guys leave this morning?  4.45.  4.45.  You don't like your gift, Jimmy?  And I couldn't fall asleep until 3.  So enjoy your T-shirt.  I like my gift.  Or you know what?  I'll give you two more T-shirts.  It'll, you know, put them all together.  It's not my gift that I dislike.  It is the lack of gifts that I dislike.  Norton knows that he loves...  We love him.  He wants more.  Yeah, you really showed it today, Gil.  Yeah.  Jimmy's a quantity guy.  Couldn't fit a hooker in the basket.  No, no, no.  You couldn't throw in an extra, an extra 90... 
[01:06:00]  Look at how...  Look at this.  This is clothing.  Look at this big, heavy, lovely thing to wear.  Free FM.  Well, now I can't give Ben his gift because it's even better than...  Oh, my.  Uh-oh.  All right, let's see what Ben gets.  What is Ben's gift?  It's an unmarked package.  Oh.  Hair care products?  Why don't we give Norton the food?  Here, give Norton all the cheese.  No, I don't...  I'm not going to eat it.  Oh, see, now you can't have, like...  How did I trump Jim on this whole deal?  Yeah, what did you get?  Oh, you two DVDs, CDs. 
[01:06:30]  I got a huge book in here.  My gift stinks.  Free FM T-shirt, you know.  A huge book.  What is this called?  Who divvied these up?  Gil, what's going on?  Back in Philly, thinking that Jimmy would be happy with that.  Nice.  You know you have to make...  He gets...  Look at...  Ben gets a giant, like a coffee table book, a U2 book.  That's excellent.  Thank you, Gil.  Thank you very much.  Well, they know that Ben likes U2.  Oh.  They know I like wine.  They know Anthony likes...  A little vodka there, sure.  A little vodka. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, apparently I like Free FM T-shirts.  What am I, a listener?  No, you don't like anything.  You know what?  Don't even hand me the shirt.  Maybe I can stand outside and you can tie it up and throw it to me and I can jump up and catch it.  Oh, my God.  I was going to give Karen Buck props for getting you guys all the gifts.  Yeah.  But she wouldn't agree to getting Jim Norton porn, so we kind of had to...  I don't want porn.  My friend Yoshi works for Evil Angel.  All my friends are directors there.  I get free porn all the time.  We pretty much get a box of porn sent to us once a month with all the latest titles. 
[01:07:30]  You're probably hooked up, huh?  Who's Steve?  All right, we're not done.  Steve C gets a little something.  I'm going to give Jimmy half of Steve's present.  No, I won't take half of Steve's present.  Absolutely not.  Steve has half a stomach.  I don't even have his gift.  I don't know how this happened.  I really don't.  Now, Jimmy's going to get half of the prize if he's the ninth caller.  Start calling, Jimmy.  She's trying to make good, but at this point, it's too late.  It's not her fault.  It's not her fault.  All right, Steve.  He didn't distribute the gifts.  This is an awfully hefty sack.  It's a salmon and a beehive for our big bear friend.  Exactly.  How'd you guess?  It is a stack of some wonderful CDs.  Ooh. 
[01:08:00]  Metallica CDs.  Stain.  Nice.  That's really good.  Let me put my T-shirt on and we can link them together.  Wow.  Wait, let me see your CDs.  Sure.  You're not going to smash them, are you?  No, I like Stain.  I'm taking that away from you.  I would steal the Metallica one.  You're not going to want to sit on Stain?  I will, actually.  Depending on which one it is.  No, I want that.  I got a wonderful T-shirt that I'm going to hack the sleeves off of.  Of course.  Because nothing.  You must show those tattoos and those big burly arms.  That's right.  There you go.  That's the only one I want.  I'll give it back after I burn it.  Yeah, right. 
[01:08:30]  Are you taking one of his CDs?  Of course I am.  Because he's going to...  What kind of power is that?  It's not actually power because I'm three times his size and all that.  I'll wind up taking it back from him before the day's over.  And a little extra.  You look down at your envelope as you say that.  You don't look up at all.  It's like, yeah, it's just a radio joke.  It's called multitasking.  Why don't you just wink at him while you say it like someone's uncle?  Club Soda Kenny.  Did you hear what Steve just said?  He didn't mean it.  You didn't mean it, right, Steve?  Sounded like a threat, Kenny.  It was a threat, Kenny. 
[01:09:00]  He didn't mean it.  This is the first situation since you joined us officially.  No, it's a non-issue.  He was just making fun?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a slip of the tongue, a faux pas.  You know, it happens.  You should ask him.  You know, he had a little brain fart.  We forgive him.  What a chance, Steve.  Steve, please apologize.  It was a joke.  And I'm sorry that you can't take a joke.  Ooh.  Wow.  Kenny and I are friendly now.  We work out together. 
[01:09:30]  We're cohorts.  Yes, you are.  All right.  Well, thank you to the ladies from WYSP.  Yeah, and guys, on behalf of us, the station, and all the fans in Philadelphia, welcome.  Cool.  And what's the buzz down there?  Because Gil on the phone has nothing.  It's huge.  What's the buzz?  I bet you...  You guys are talking to the ladies.  Aren't they more important anyway?  No, because we always get uncomfortable when there's hot ladies in the studio.  Yeah, we don't know how to handle it.  We turn into junior high school.  We finally acknowledge that on our radio show.  This is going to be huge. 
[01:10:00]  We turn into, like, nerds.  It's really, really bad.  Yeah, I feel like I'm in junior high again when there's cute girls around.  But what's the buzz, really?  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  We haven't been able to leave, like, you know, the people still to this day were always talking  to us about O&A.  Bring them back.  Bring them back.  The fact that you guys are back is, like, the biggest thing.  And are they getting their WOW stickers together down there?  Absolutely.  You know what happened?  As we speak.  When we got fired, obviously, WOW is our huge, huge thing that we do.  Whip them out Wednesdays, and people are starting to dig up their old WOW stickers 
[01:10:30]  and stuff.  When we got fired, remember how many boxes of WOW stickers they ended up burning?  Yeah, we had a lot.  What happened to the WOW stickers in Philly?  Well, we hung on to them for a while.  Right.  Well, cut them in strips and used them as tape.  Yeah, because they were hoping we were coming back.  But there was a memo that was sent out, and they were told to destroy the WOW stickers.  And I heard rumors about furnaces and all sorts of things where they were just burning WOW stickers.  A sticker holocaust, O.B.?  Well, because what happened was, when we got fired, they wanted to get rid of the WOW stickers 
[01:11:00]  immediately, and they just ordered a ridiculous amount of stickers on the station.  It's faces of them.  All right, Gil.  We look forward to working with you guys down there in Philly.  We're super pumped up.  I swear to God, we can't wait to have you guys back in Philly.  We said in the meeting yesterday, too, we're going to be in Philly.  I don't know.  You guys come up with something that makes sense.  We'll be down there.  We're going to make it happen.  Yeah, just make sure you come up with it in July or August, so I don't have to wear any  outerwear.  Or his little t-shirt. 
[01:11:30]  God, you guys just played right into Jimmy's paranoia, man.  Jimmy wants to feel special, too.  Yeah, I want to feel nice.  Did you bring your box of positive affirmations?  It's a box of tender sentiments.  Tender sentiments.  That's what it is.  Did you bring the box?  No, I didn't.  That was the responsibility of someone on this crew.  We'll be very busy, and they're probably doing a million things.  Do you want to explain that to the terrestrial radio stations?  I'd rather not.  It makes me feel like a fag.  But the box of tender sentiments is a box of little pleasant things that I read when I'm  sad. 
[01:12:00]  And you're very sad right now.  I certainly am.  All right.  Thank you, Gil.  All right.  Very good, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  Gil?  Dude, you got an endless bank of plugs.  Hey, Gil, question.  All right, really fast, because we've got to take a break.  Max in Dallas, real fast.  We've got to take a break.  Hello, you fancier men.  I just had a question for Jimmy.  Go ahead, Max.  What is your opinion of the ladies from Philadelphia?  Remember you stated it about roughly a year ago on XM Radio? 
[01:12:30]  That they're all dead dead.  Jesus.  By and large, most experiences I've had with girls that I've gone out with in Philadelphia  has been an abomination.  Not that the ones I've taken out that talk a good game have never come through.  They'll be flirty.  And then just, when it comes time to get to some action.  They give nothing.  Nothing.  Do you have any idea how many girls in Philadelphia I've gone out with that wound up walking home  after being booted out on the shoulder of a road somewhere?  He threw me out of the car.  Come on.  That dumb accent. 
[01:13:00]  What's going on?  Come on.  Out.  All right.  Thank you, Max.  He touched me, and then he threw me out of the car.  He touched me.  I told him I didn't want him to touch me.  Then he told me, are you taking acting class?  We really got to take a break.  On the way, Bill Donahue from the Catholic League and our old friends Pugs and Kelly will  be checking in to say hi to us today.  Also from Dallas.  From, yes, Dallas Tech.  Nice.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, Percy Faye. 
[01:13:30]  Soothing.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Trying to eat a little breakfast here.  Nice to see some things don't change from one medium to another. 
[01:14:00]  Opie's still eating.  Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.  Opie's a grazing guy.  He's got to be eating all the time.  That Cynthia McKinney, that congresswoman from Atlanta who's accused of hitting that cop.  Uh-huh.  Every time I see her stupid, toothy, wide-eyed face, I want to spit my gum in it.  She looks like a nut.  Say, settle down there.  That's a little tough punishment.  Spit your gum in her face?  Sentenced to Jimmy Norton spitting his gum in your face.  That's just degrading, though.  And the hiv you'll get from it. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  Why did you do that?  Well, you can ask yourself that in six months when you're putting new little holes in your belt.  Get a conductor to punch at you.  Oh, that was close.  Yeah, it certainly was.  It's going to happen eventually.  Who's going to curse first?  I know.  Start making your bets.  Yeah.  Maybe you should have wore your name badge.  I'm, uh, we're, uh, we're getting used to our new, uh, surroundings.  We got to acknowledge this massive window they put in. 
[01:15:00]  It's great.  You get to overlook New York City.  Yeah.  This studio is pretty much just blackened.  And, uh, Keith, the cop just came up to me and he comes up with a very interesting question.  He's wondering how many of these women will, uh, uh, how many of these women, uh, Jesus, uh, how many of these windows will have naked, uh, women?  Yeah.  Uh, when we were at NEW, we faced an apartment building and the bathrooms were right there across the, uh, the road. 
[01:15:30]  And we saw some shows, saw some shows.  A couple of times there were, um, frosted windows.  A couple of times the windows were up a little bit so you could just see a little skin.  And I remember a couple of guys being called out because you go, someone would, uh, ring the alert.  It was like, alarm, alarm.  And everyone come running over to look at who was showering.  We would give up on the radio show.  Yeah.  We would just walk away from the mics and, uh, look at the window only to realize to our horror that it was a guy showering. 
[01:16:00]  And whoever called everyone over was then, uh, you know, called, uh, homo.  How do you not notice in the shower?  I can see if it's in the winter across the street, a Russian hat, but in the shower, it's pretty obvious, right?  Well, you see somebody like Travis, maybe.  Oh, Jimmy, look what's in front of you.  Hairless and thin.  Look what's in front of you.  Doesn't even do any good.  Jimmy's really, really bummed that he only got like, uh, uh, I don't know, a free FM t-shirt from Philly and a Starbucks card. 
[01:16:30]  I wouldn't say bummed is the word.  Like, I don't need it.  How many Starbucks cards do you have?  Uh, right now, none.  Because I had a really nice one and I lost it.  This is, this is actually just the, the, the plain one.  Of course it would be.  It's, it's the one that, I had like a really fun festive one and it was lost.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Yeah.  But no, I'll be, wear this a lot, you know.  Why don't, why don't you reach into your box?  You gotta do it.  This is the box of, uh.  Tender sentiments.  Tender sentiments that Jimmy reaches into.  And Jimmy only goes into the box when he's feeling blue. 
[01:17:00]  And he didn't get, uh, enough presents.  What does that one say, Jimmy?  People are happy to see you.  That just picks up my spirits a lot.  Makes me nauseous.  People in 49 states, apparently not Pennsylvania, but in the other 49 states, people are happy to see me.  Box of tender sentiments.  I hate that you asked for that and got it.  You know what?  Even the noise of the box sounds pathetic. 
[01:17:30]  When he shakes it so he doesn't, so he doesn't get a, an old one.  You never want the same sentiment twice.  It's bad luck.  And you're running out of sentiments, by the way.  I am.  The boys are gonna have to write a few more.  It's unspoken child's lore that if you pull out the same sentiment twice, you develop a tumor in your bag.  And, uh, anyway, uh, uh, yesterday, horrible, may I just make one quick observation about the last commercial break?  Yes.  Uh, as long as it does not disparage the last sponsor. 
[01:18:00]  Uh, I don't think it disparages the last sponsor, but as a member of that organization, I find it hard to believe that we would be recruiting the pests to join my job, because, uh, I just don't see it.  Uh, is our demo the, uh, next NYPD officers?  Yes, as a matter of fact.  What the hell are you talking about?  Yeah.  You didn't catch the last commercial break.  The last commercial was, uh, a recruitment for the NYPD on our show. 
[01:18:30]  I don't think, see, you know how vast our, um, our reach is now?  Can you explain something to Keith the cop?  Keith, do you realize only New York heard that?  Only New York heard the commercial, which is what?  It was a recruitment spot for, uh, NYPD.  Okay, the rest of, uh, the terrestrial stations did not hear it, because they do their local commercials.  Right.  Uh, the satellite radio audience did not hear it.  No.  And I would bet money that everyone listening on DirecTV did not hear that. 
[01:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  I didn't even hear it.  I'm right here.  And we didn't hear it, because we don't listen to the commercials, because we're too busy eating and going to the bathroom and, uh, running down the hall to see how we're doing.  What was an observation for the New York audience?  Could you arrest yourself for felony doll?  I just had a picture of, like, Stripes.  The beginning of Stripes, when they, uh, bring all the recruitment people in.  And now I'm done.  But no, no, what would happen?  I, I, there's something there. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, boy.  Shut up.  Oh, Jimmy.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Don't, don't encourage him.  Crash me.  I'm done.  That was a fine debut on this, uh.  We will always remember those as the first words of Keith the Cop on our, uh, CBS.  Look at this.  That was a swing and a miss where, like, you have, like, back surgery as needed.  He is dizzy.  He's sweating.  He might pass out from that bomb.  Keith is all red and sweaty.  All right, Keith.  Thanks.  Why don't you move way over there? 
[01:20:00]  That's all right.  So we got to find out about.  More harrowing than his first collar, I bet.  Yeah, we got to find out about, uh.  Is he going to go talk to Kenny now?  Like, you know, I just wanted to make a point.  Kenny's like, I know, I know.  They're just going up for the radio.  Uh, no, we're not.  By the way, we got to find out what's going on with these windows.  Maybe JV and Elvis, who do the show after us here in New York, can maybe fill us in and let us know if there's any action in these windows.  Any binoculars?  Have you seen binoculars?  Because if you see binoculars around the studio, you know they're not for, um, stargazing. 
[01:20:30]  We could easily see 20 buildings.  Yeah.  Right outside the window.  And you can tell the bathroom windows.  Because they're kind of smaller.  Well, that's what I was at.  Which ones are the bathroom windows?  The bathroom windows are the thin ones and the ones with the, uh, shampoo bottles on them.  Oh, you see that?  Things like that.  Yeah.  Oh, okay, good.  And those are the ones you got to look for.  All right, we're going to get some action eventually outside the window.  Hey, we got to go to Boston.  We're being heard on WBCN today.  Hey.  And we couldn't be happier.  It's, uh, Chachi, everyone, from WBCN.  What's up?  Good morning. 
[01:21:00]  I hope you do a better job than Gil.  I hope so, too.  Congratulations.  We're glad to have you back in Boston, man.  Hey, happy birthday, Ant.  How you doing, Opie?  Thank you.  Jim Norton, how you doing, buddy?  I'm Chachi.  Thank you for calling.  Long time.  We haven't talked in a while.  Our third incarnation.  O and A.  We are psyched.  3.0.  Yeah, WBCN and everyone in Boston psyched.  You have a huge audience here.  You started here.  This is your hometown.  Uh, yes.  Back in the day at good old WAAF. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  That fine Worcester station.  I tell you, they've been gloating for the last two months, but that will end.  And then all those other stations, all the gloating will stop.  When Opie lived in, uh, what, where'd you live?  Wellesley?  Yeah, good old Wellesley.  And I lived in Ashland.  Yeah.  Ugh.  I lived in an apartment complex in Ashland.  And Opie had a nice little place in, uh, Wellesley.  Well, Wellesley's pretty nice, but Ashland's another question.  Tell me about it.  Yeah, Ashland is like, whew, how many Brazilians can they fit in that place?  Well, we're happy to have you back. 
[01:22:00]  I want to say congratulations.  It's really a great day for BCN.  Yeah, let us know when the mayor finally has a comment.  I don't think he'll ever comment, unfortunately.  That was 11 years ago, I think, right?  Uh, it was, uh, 8 years ago, yeah.  Oh, 8 years ago.  Was it 8?  Forgive or forget, you know?  It was 8 years ago we pulled that fine prank on the mayor of Boston.  You would think in 8 years the guy wouldn't even still be in office.  8 years later.  And he was in office for how long when we got there?  I know, he's the most popular mayor still.  Yeah, up there. 
[01:22:30]  It's amazing, but I tell you, man, we have so many great memories of you guys.  The guy eating his, a guy eating another guy's spleen at BCN on the air with you guys was pretty amazing.  Oh, yeah.  You remember that?  He went on a trip to the Super Bowl, and he was sick the entire way down.  Did he get sick with the guy's spleen?  Wow, this was really bad.  Wait, we just explained this story the other day on the show, and I forgot about the spleen.  Yeah, the guy brought in his spleen.  It was removed, right?  Oh, my God, that's right.  He was in a car accident or something, and he was able to talk the doctor into this or the surgeon or whatever, 
[01:23:00]  which is, I guess you're not allowed to do this whatsoever.  Take his organ home with him.  But he was able to take his own organ home with him.  I forgot all about that.  And there was a guy in studio that actually ate a piece of that guy's spleen.  Yeah, what was funny was he brought it in in a jar of formaldehyde.  Right.  You guys threw it in the microwave.  And the other dude ate it to win Super Bowl tickets.  And then the GM at the time, Berardini, comes in and says, throw out that microwave.  You don't want the microwave that the spleen was cooked in? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Because it kind of exploded in the microwave.  It's like spleen.  And then, you know, the Chowder contest was amazing to win Super Bowl tickets.  Yeah.  We really want to bring back the Chowder contest.  Well, can I just tell you this quick story?  I remember Ben called me and said, you have Super Bowl tickets, and this is what we want to do.  We want to hide the tickets in a book at the Boston Public Library and tell the listeners to go find it.  And I'm like, dude, you cannot do that.  The library, there'd be a riot. 
[01:24:00]  And so then I said, come with another idea.  The next day he calls me back.  He says, here's the idea.  We're going to have 10 people eating clam Chowder.  And the last one who doesn't throw up wins.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And I got one of the most famous seafood restaurants to give us 400 gallons of Chowder for free.  And they said, don't give us any plugs.  Yeah, they didn't want plugs.  But here's the Chowder.  So, you know, those days were great.  And, you know, I'm the last one standing at BCN.  All the old guys there are gone. 
[01:24:30]  Hey, do you remember that we went to River Rave that time?  And who were the dudes that headlined those black dudes?  Cypress Hill?  Not public.  I didn't headline it.  No.  Well, you've described it so well, Jimmy.  Those black dudes.  Hey, yeah.  Could be the temptations.  Outcast.  Outcast.  Outcast, right.  Whatever happened to the pictures that were taken that day by the photographer for BCN?  Is he looking for pictures from five years ago?  If we didn't get fired four years ago, you would have mailed those pictures.  But I would like to get my picture with Outcast. 
[01:25:00]  Picture whore.  I can find that for you.  Jimmy Norton.  Thank you.  No problem.  But listen, congratulations.  Great to have you back on.  The entire staff is totally recharged.  Really great to talk to you guys.  We love ONA.  Thank you, Chachi.  Thank you, Chachi.  Okay, buddy.  See you soon, you guys.  Bye, mister.  Yeah, we'll be back in Boston in, I don't know, sometime this summer, that's for sure.  This is like an official welcome back.  I like this.  Yeah, we're just kind of letting everyone kiss our ass.  Don't we have a Boston date May 12th for going back?  Why would we go back to Boston May 12th? 
[01:25:30]  Are we, Jimmy?  Well, I'll be there with David Tell doing the Orpheum.  I thought maybe people would come and see us.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not about the plug.  Of course it's not about the plug.  I thought you guys would be up there.  The shameless, awful, obvious plugs that Jimmy gives.  All right, let's go to Scott in Bayside.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Scott.  Congratulations, and welcome back to New York Air.  Thank you, sir.  Anthony, happy birthday.  Thank you, sir.  I am a long-time listener, and a couple of questions.  I heard you talking about WoW a little while ago. 
[01:26:00]  Are you planning on bringing it back to the New York area?  It never went away, believe it or not, but yes, of course.  Well, it kind of died down a little bit, being that you went to XM.  There wasn't as much going on with it.  Are you going to do the bigger promotions again?  Yeah, supposedly they're going to be making WoW stickers in the very near future,  and they're going to be handing them out all over the New York area.  Nice, very nice.  And let me ask you something.  What ever happened to Spike?  Spike?  Oh, wow.  Geez, I don't know. 
[01:26:30]  You're going back quite a ways.  Yeah, we've lost a lot of the old people and brought in a whole bunch of new people.  Only a couple of the people from the NEW days made the transition over,  because so much time passed by.  The Retarded Laverne and Shirley, Patty, Stalker Patty, she's still hanging around.  Other than that, Frenchy tried.  Frenchy tried, failed miserably.  You've never heard anybody suck like he did when he called into the XM show. 
[01:27:00]  And he was so good on NEW, because he'd call up and just lambast the retarded Laverne and Shirley,  who were these two women that were like friends since junior high, and they grew up.  One of them, they're both just out of their minds.  Really, I think some type of retardation is there.  One got married, is living her life.  The other one, we've just watched her life go into a steady decline since then.  Lady Di, you might remember, worked at Budweiser.  She used to come in, have fun.  Oh, have a good time with her little pal there. 
[01:27:30]  Now, homeless, living behind a path mark in Jersey on the train tracks.  So that story's turned quite tragic or very funny, depending on if you know her.  I find it hysterical.  And the ONA pests have gone out to the area she's living at and took a lot of great video.  They taped a Lady Di Cribs kind of thing.  All right, we've got to step aside because we've got to sync up with Bill Donahue from the Catholic League. 
[01:28:00]  All righty.  We'll talk to Bill Donahue next.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202.  Thanks, Erock.  It's your Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Working out all the bugs, obviously.  I hope you heard that out there.  Go!  Over-eager, Erock.  He's very over-eager.  All right.  And his entire family is listening on WPBZ in West Palm Beach. 
[01:28:30]  That's right.  Hello to Erock's family.  Let me be Erock.  Respond, Anthony.  Oh.  And it makes it worse because it's very echoey in here because they're still building the studio.  So, yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And we're very, very happy about that today.  Indeed.  Indeed.  And someone that made it very, very easy for us to come back is on the hotline right now.  And we want to say hi to him. 
[01:29:00]  It's Mr. Bill Donahue from the Catholic League.  Hello, Bill.  How you guys doing?  So far, so good, sir.  Got a little bit of a cold here on this end.  But, you know, first day on the job.  Can't take the day off.  Well, listen, I wish you guys the best.  You can have a great run this time.  I know it.  I got to thank you personally because this is Opie.  Anthony called you and I was going to call and Anthony said, you know, I took care of  things and had a really nice conversation with Bill Donahue.  And I got to say, man, you made our comeback very, very easy because there was a lot of 
[01:29:30]  people that were scared that there was going to be a huge uproar when we came back to regular  radio.  Well, you know, it's kind of funny.  I'm getting some flack from some people.  I don't know which side they're coming from.  It doesn't make any difference to me because they're saying, you know, who bribed you,  who whatever.  I don't think people understand.  Quite frankly, we all screw up.  I mean, Catholics have even institutionalized a remedy.  It's called confession.  I mean, you guys, when 2002 did something I couldn't approve of.  And then in 2004 when you came back, I said, good for you. 
[01:30:00]  And I'm as happy to be on your show at that point again.  So it's nothing new for me to sit here in the catbird seat and say, listen, that's  over with.  I don't hold grudges.  Anybody who does this, he's got a mental problem.  I wish you guys the best.  And we appreciate that.  I guess Howard Stern is claiming that you were paid a large sum of money for the press  release that you sent out.  Well, you know, it's amazing.  Howard was last week condemning you guys what happened a long time ago.  And I'm thinking, my God, it's the first time I ever remember him finding the anti-Catholicism 
[01:30:30]  was a problem.  I mean, it seems to be that he can use it against you, that therefore he's going to drag me into  it.  Like, all of a sudden, now I become weak on fighting anti-Catholicism.  Look, the guy's a fraud.  When it's good for him, he'll blurt it out.  And that's what he did.  He was trying to actually pit Catholics against Jews on his show.  He was saying that a company hired Opie and Anthony, who desecrated the church, and it's 
[01:31:00]  a company run by, and then he just named one Jewish guy after another, trying to make  this confrontation that would undermine our program.  Well, you know, that's a strained way to look at it.  And it's also malicious, quite frankly.  Absolutely.  I would condemn that kind of thing.  You know, divide and conquer.  Look, Catholics and Jews had better stick together today because we've got a concern out there  about radical Muslims, who I wish would learn to just put down their machete.  Yeah, huh?  And how about maybe one or two of them coming out and saying how bad the extremists are? 
[01:31:30]  Well, that's just it.  I mean, the fact of the matter is, I don't care whether you've got extremists in every rank,  and we've seen it before in history, but right now, we do need the more responsible members  of the Muslim community to speak out.  Otherwise, this world is headed to another world war.  Well, whenever you have, like, it's an abortion bombing or some extreme Catholic, you have Catholics  coming out against it and kind of trashing that organization or that person or that extreme  behavior, and Muslims just seem to refuse to want to do it when it comes to trashing radical 
[01:32:00]  Islam.  Well, you just take a look at what happened a few weeks ago with Abdul Rahman.  Sixteen years ago, the guy converted, he was a Muslim, he converted to Catholicism, okay?  He met some Catholics, and they persuaded him, or they're a good example, whatever it was.  It certainly wasn't me.  And he decided to become, he was an Afghanistan guy.  So what happened here a few weeks ago when they found out about it, that he was a convert?  Five hundred imams took to the streets demanding that this man, that they take his head off. 
[01:32:30]  Now, I can't imagine for a moment, you get five hundred priests, rabbis, and ministers  to take to the streets demanding that somebody lose his head because the guy changed his religion.  So, yeah, we've got a serious problem here.  You've got politics mixed in with religion.  It can be very dangerous.  I do represent, I do understand separation of church and state, despite what some people  might say.  We've got a real problem here, and that's why Catholics and Jews have to hang tight, and  listen, and embrace our Muslim buddies who realize that this thing is out of control.  You've got a government over there in Iran calling for the destruction of Israel. 
[01:33:00]  We have to stand up to these bullies, otherwise we'll face what we've seen before in history.  Absolutely.  Do you think Iran, because that's really a very uncomfortable situation, is this guy just  kind of looking for attention, like North Korea, who kind of sounded off just hoping  they'd get some attention from the U.S., or do you think he really wants to get into  it?  Well, then Iran doesn't need money, though, I don't think.  No.  Yeah, I think he really wants to get into it.  I'll tell you, the guy, Kim Dao-jong out at North Korea, nobody ever listens to this  guy.  So, I mean, he's surrounded by Asian countries which are not particularly fond of him. 
[01:33:30]  The problem with Aminajad, the guy who's the head of Iran, is that he does have some  people in that part of the world who would agree with him.  So, I think it's far more dangerous in the sense of what he's prepared to do.  He'd like to be, you know, the guy who leads the Muslim world against the Jews and the  Americans, and he's got to be stopped.  Why is he so vocal about it?  That's what I don't quite get, is this guy is so, like, normally you kind of hide an  agenda if you want to do something, but he's just coming right out and going, no, no,  no, we think they should be kind of taken off the map. 
[01:34:00]  Well, we've seen this before in history.  I mean, sometimes these people are nothing but shouters.  You're right.  But on the other hand, you know, a guy like him, I mean, you have to understand, the people  who listen to him and who support him are millions.  And so it's not like the head of North Korea, who really doesn't have a whole lot of support,  and you couldn't tell whether or not his own people support him because of the dictatorial  regime.  But unfortunately, there are a number of people who have taken a radical interpretation of  the Koran, and they would like to impose their Sharia law on the rest of us. 
[01:34:30]  And quite frankly, I like what the Prime Minister of Australia did.  Here, about a month or so, he went on TV, and he said, Muslims are welcome in this country  as long as they want to blend in and accept our idea of religious liberty.  But to the extent that you've come here, and you're going to impose your idea, your autocratic  rule on the rest of us, then get out.  Well, can you imagine, like, with the cartoons, the Danish cartoons, there was rioting and just  despicable behavior.  And then you look at Kanye West, who was on the cover of Rolling Stone, wearing, like, a  crown of thorns.  And, you know, a lot of people might have found that offensive, but you didn't see other 
[01:35:00]  religions, you know, rioting and burning embassies over offensive political cartoons.  No, there's a proper way to deal with it.  I'm dealing with a serious case at the University of Oregon with the newspaper, The Insurgent,  showing pictures of Jesus with an erection hanging from the cross.  I'm dealing with that today.  We have a lot of filth that we have to deal with here at the Catholic League, but we deal  with it in a judicial manner.  We don't ask even for the government to be the right remedy.  I would rather be insulted by people, even though they have no moral right to do it.  I'd rather be insulted and have my religion insulted as opposed to have the government 
[01:35:30]  to remedy, never mind taking to the streets and asking for somebody to take his head off.  I mean, that kind of barbarism has to be condemned by every decent person in this country.  Do you look at any type of, because a lot of people have certain art forms that use religious  figures, do you look at any of that and let it go and not make it controversial and try  to put a stop to it?  Oh, sure.  I mean, first of all, when in doubt, if we sit around here in a staff and we decide, you 
[01:36:00]  know, we're wondering, is this really that offensive?  The answer, obviously, is that it isn't.  If you have to think about it, then it isn't.  And if there's some artist that some dump down in Soho nobody ever heard of tries to get  my attention, I won't give them the attention.  However, when the establishment hits, when Sony and Columbia Pictures hit, and they're  going to put out a movie, Da Vinci Code, which may be okay if I get my disclaimer, but if  it's based off a book which is riddled with lies about the Catholic Church, at that point,  people say to me, well, you're going to give it more attention going on TV.  I can't give it much more attention. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, you've got Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and I'm keeping an open mind about Ron Howard.  Maybe he'll come across, you know, in a good way.  But, you know, let me say something about these Danish cartoons.  I'm a graduate of New York University.  I love NYU.  I was very disheartened to find out that NYU caved to radical Muslims and wouldn't even  show depictions of Muhammad.  And we see this duplicity all over the country, thrashing Catholicism, but every time we're  going to give Muslims a break.  And I'm just simply saying, why not respect everybody without the threat of violence?  How about the New York Times wouldn't do it either?  I mean, the Times refused to reprint them, and so did I. 
[01:37:00]  I think it was, did you just say New York Magazine?  It was the Village Voice.  There's another one where five editors quickly refused to reprint them.  Well, not only did the New York Times refuse to reprint them, but the New York Times in  the same article, which was an excellent article about the problem nationwide, actually reprinted  a photocopy of the sensation exhibit of where they threw dung on the Virgin Mary, which I  had a demonstration in the streets about.  I mean, why, look at the situation at the University of Oregon, a conservative newspaper  there ran the depictions of Muhammad, and so now a left-wing newspaper has decided to 
[01:37:30]  trash Christianity as a result.  But why Christians?  Why is it always Christians, and particularly Roman Catholics, that if they get the brunt of  making their analogy, why not choose somebody else?  But no, they won't, because it's politically correct to slam Catholics.  Because they're phonies, and they think they're being really rebellious by trashing, A, the  middle class, or B, trashing, and you can trash Catholicism as far as I'm concerned, or  any religion, but don't only trash one where you think there's going to be no repercussions,  and they're afraid if they trash Islam, it's just going to be considered racist. 
[01:38:00]  You know what I don't agree with a lot of times with you, Bill?  Is when people take artistic freedom and do things based on the Catholic religion, and  you guys take it as a documentary, and that it's going to be interpreted that way, like  Kevin Smith's Dogma.  I know you had a big problem in a run-in with Kevin Smith about that.  When the movie itself was fiction, why is that such a big issue? 
[01:38:30]  Why can't the Catholic religion be used as a backdrop to a fictitious story without these  people now having to fight for their careers?  Well, let's just talk about CBS.  CBS refuses to show the reruns of Amos and Andy.  Why?  That's fiction.  I got them all on DVD.  It doesn't matter to me.  I watch them every night.  No, what I'm saying, though, is why...  I'm just asking you that question.  Why is that so sensitive when it's being used? 
[01:39:00]  Obviously, as a backdrop, in a fictitious manner, just as a storyline, why the sensitivity  there?  Well, look, I think you could make a fictional account to virtually any group.  My mind runs wild on this kind of thing.  I think you guys can give the examples, too.  Every group has its stereotype, and if you want to do a fictional account which just  bleeds these people, you might expect a reaction from the NAACP, GLAD, NOW, ADL, whoever  it might be.  The thing with Kevin and me actually got blown up, I think, by the media, larger than 
[01:39:30]  it was.  It even got to the point where I told Kevin I was going to buy him a beer, and then he  said, I can't believe that Donnie wants to buy me a beer.  Obviously, he doesn't know me, because the first thing I would do is buy the guy a beer.  Then I'd make him buy the next three rounds.  Well, I think what he said after he, because we interviewed him, and he said, I read that  he wanted to buy me a beer, I think I just want to punch him in the face, or something  like that.  So I don't think he's as forgiving for the hell he sees that you put him through. 
[01:40:00]  I think Kevin will survive.  Yeah, no, I think he'll do all right, but it just seems that a lot of groups, and I'm  not just singling out the Catholic League, a lot of groups make it so difficult to be  artistic these days, and in a way where you're using a certain group, a nationality, a race  as a backdrop, and not presenting it in any way as documentary or fact.  It's drama, it's comedy, and everyone seems to be so sensitive to it these days that you're 
[01:40:30]  at the risk of losing your job, getting in trouble, getting sued, if you're just putting  out pure art.  Well, let me give you an example of the kind of thing I certainly wouldn't be upset with.  Mel Brooks is a perfect example.  This guy, when he does his movies, he lampoons everybody.  Catholics get it, Jews get it, blacks get it, and homosexuals get it.  And it's obviously not malicious.  He doesn't single any one particular group out.  The problem that I have is this.  Hollywood, for about the last 25 years, seems to have a very protective status for certain 
[01:41:00]  groups in our society.  I mean, you won't see anybody, for example, who will come out and say that I am a producer  and I'm associated with a movie which is anti-Jewish, anti-black, anti-gay.  However, we have John Kelly, who is a co-producer of The Da Vinci Code, who said in the New  York Times, quoted by Sharon Waxman, that The Da Vinci Code movie is conservatively anti-Catholic,  whatever the hell conservatively means.  I don't know if you hear it, conservatively anti-Semitic. 
[01:41:30]  So my point is simply this.  It is in vogue in certain quarters in Hollywood and in our society.  It's certainly on the college campuses where I used to spend many years as a professor  to slam certain segments of the population.  And I'm just looking for a level playing field.  Do I agree that some people, including myself, overreact and the like?  Yeah.  That's why guys like you should call me on it.  I agree with you, too, about it.  It's very safe to attack Catholics and Christians as opposed to other groups.  Part of it, I mean, like there's always a pendulum swing. 
[01:42:00]  And when you look back, say, to Lenny Bruce's career, who really was kind of ruined for making  fun of the church, I mean, there really has been at one point entertainers were murdered  creatively for attacking the church at all.  It just seems like it's swung the other way now where it's completely safe to do it.  Well, that's just it.  And you know what bothers me more than anything else?  It's the phoniness.  It's the people who say, oh, no, I'm tolerant and I understand what autistic freedom is about  and everything else.  You're not tolerant.  You have certain groups which you think it's a virtue to be intolerant to. 
[01:42:30]  And it certainly would be my group.  And then you're very protective of other groups.  And all I'm simply saying is this, the cowardice of this country, I'm talking about the electronic  and the print media, the way they handled the 12 Danish cartoons, they weren't even vulgar  depictions.  It's not even in the Koran to say you can't have a depiction of Mohammed.  Nonetheless, they all decided they wouldn't do it.  Why?  Well, the Boston Phoenix newspaper at least had the guts to admit it.  They were scared to death they'd lose their heads.  That's what we've come down to in this country.  So some radical Muslims, some crazies out there can threaten you with violence to take your 
[01:43:00]  head off, and all of a sudden you'll show them some due respect.  That's a hell of a lesson to send.  Yep.  And the New York Times, to me, was just the most disgraceful of all of them, because they're  the ones that are supposed to be on the forefront of the news in this country.  They're just the most disgraceful.  I agree with you.  I mean, I couldn't believe it.  And on college campuses, you know, the great passions of freedom of speech.  You can take a crucifix, dunk it in a jar of urine, and get a federal grant for it.  I mean, but yet you can't even have a depiction of Mohammed. 
[01:43:30]  No, the duplicity is revolting.  I like what you said before about an even playing field.  You know, that pretty much is what this is all about.  If you're going to be able to use one religion, race, nationality as a backdrop for something,  for drama or fiction, it should be that you don't catch flack for doing it with somebody else's.  Yeah, and ground it in ethics, or do what Mel Brooks does.  Mel Brooks, again, plays off some stereotypes, but he doesn't single anybody out. 
[01:44:00]  And everybody knows it's good old-fashioned American humor.  It's not done in a malicious fashion, as some comedians like Bill Maher and Penn Jillette  and other people have done in the past.  And we could all laugh at the gays, right, Bill?  We could all laugh at everybody, man.  Hey!  Some of my best friends are gay.  How's that?  Bill, we've got to go.  Take a break.  But, man, thanks for calling in.  And, you know, thanks for the second chance. 
[01:44:30]  Forgiveness, man.  I love it.  I wish you guys the best.  And I'm glad Joe Hollander made the right choice.  So are we.  Thank you so much, Angelo.  Thanks, Bill.  Bill Donahue, everyone, from the Catholic League.  Right.  All right.  We're going to take another break, I guess?  Yeah.  Remind me.  I've got to write that check to him.  That big check.  He made it really easy for us, I've got to tell you.  Real easy.  All right.  When we get back, we've got some IMAS audio.  We did a hookup with him earlier this morning, and we had horrendous technical problems. 
[01:45:00]  And he talks about that.  He's really upset.  Ooh.  We also have an ex-enemy in the studio.  Uh-huh.  Ex-enemy?  Well, we're...  Isn't that everyone in radio at some point?  Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit.  We've been friends more years than we've been enemies, though.  Let's be honest.  Hell yeah.  It's Nick Carter, everyone.  Hey, if you can't beat them, suck their ass, you know?  Oh, jeez.  Did you talk to any of the lawyers that work here?  Are you drunk or something?  My God. 
[01:45:30]  I think he's on the pipe.  My goodness.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Something like that.  Yeah, well, yeah.  All right.  We'll talk to Nick Carter next.  And David Hickley's here from the Daily News.  I don't know if he wants to, you know, ask a question on the show.  Look at him.  I don't want to be part of this.  I just want to be an observer.  Wow.  So we'll get into some of those things in just a bit.  Also, Pugs and Kelly calling us from Dallas in just a few minutes as well.  It's the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our first day.  Yeah.  It's going pretty well so far.  Having fun.  Even though I'm a little sickly.  You hear this voice?  Hopefully by Monday, you'll be hearing the normal Anthony voice.  Sick on your birthday.  Sick on my birthday.  First day on the new gig.  That's got to blow.  Yeah, it does.  You know what, though?  It all gets better from here.  Shut up.  Well, Rocks from Texas is checking in. 
[01:46:30]  I guess you all failed on satellite, so now you're back on the airwaves.  Enjoy your FCC finds and my condolences on your future finds.  You guys are moving backwards like the no-talent hacks you are.  What a-holes.  Thank you, Rocks.  Appreciate that bit of instant feedback.  I don't think we need that type of stuff on the show.  Yeah, I mean...  It's really negative.  I really missed those, though.  I know.  Because we just got used to get slathered.  Just the lather worked up from the, uh... 
[01:47:00]  Ugh.  All I can think of right now is Rocks driving, satisfied that he heard himself red, and being  paralyzed by a drunk driver.  Dreams can come true, do you know?  Uh, let's go to the phones and say hi to Rob.  What's up, Rob?  Hey there, Rob.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  What's up?  I'm about your age from Long Island.  Uh, Catholic guy.  Born and raised at Catholic school, the whole deal.  I gotta commend you for the interview this morning.  That was a really class act, having him on.  You know, you guys, great job.  You know, Catholic faith is about forgiveness, and, uh, you know, you guys have a fresh slate. 
[01:47:30]  Best of luck.  Uh, Rob, we had no choice.  We, we, we, we had paid, you know, huge sums of money, uh, to get him on the  air, as per, you know, certain radio personalities.  Uh, no, the guy, the guy has, you know, his job.  That's what he does.  He's, uh, one of these defenders of the faith.  We don't agree a lot of times, believe me.  Um, there are extremists on both sides.  I think he's, as a matter of fact, which is odd for me to say, I think he's a little  more liberal than everybody gives him credit for. 
[01:48:00]  Uh, they have him as a real hardliner, and I think he's willing to, and open to, to talk  about things.  Um, not that we're, we're going to agree on a lot, but, you know, he's, he,  he's got the courage to come on the air and, and talk about things.  I like that.  I agree with him more on the political correctness of trashing Catholicism as opposed to the other  religions more than I disagree with him on the other stuff.  They didn't, the other, everyone else, the left annoys me more like the college campuses.  Again, best for free speech, but don't show the Muhammad picture.  And again, trash, trash Christianity. 
[01:48:30]  That makes me sicker than any conservative, uh, Catholic ideas.  All right, let's go to the phones.  We're getting, we're being heard now in, uh, Dallas once again on KLLI.  And we got to say hi to some old friends, Pugs and Kelly.  Pugs and Kelly.  Hi, guys.  Hey, guys.  Hello, Pugs and Kelly.  It is so great to talk to you.  Are we talking to you as representatives of the station or the only two English-speaking  Catholics in Dallas?  Why, there's not a lot of Catholics in Dallas?  No.  Are they all, uh, you know, not a lot of Jews in Dallas, are they?  No, they're big on Baptists. 
[01:49:00]  I'm big on Baptists.  All right.  What do I know?  Yeah.  I just knew who they weren't.  They weren't Jews and they weren't Muslims.  There's lots of singing going on in Dallas.  Hey, listen, I saw some guy in Chicago that used to be, like, your program director who  says hello.  Or, like, you guys used to intern for him.  Really?  Oh, that's great, Jim.  Oh, hello.  Wait a minute.  I didn't say, uh, people pull over.  I have a story.  I just, the guy told me, say hello to Pugs and Kelly. 
[01:49:30]  They interned for me and they're doing well.  So I'm just relaying the message.  I don't remember his name.  I wanted to do the Mike North radio program.  Something called a phone, Jimmy.  What?  Not $8 billion worth of radio equipment to say hi.  Grandma says hi.  What?  People in every city right now are interested.  Well, what was the guy's name?  This is a whole, like, ongoing story I just started.  I should be shot.  So what's the vibe down there, guys?  We are so excited to have you guys here.  We are so excited about it.  Is everybody excited to have us on in Dallas? 
[01:50:00]  I think so.  We are.  Every single person that does a radio show on your fine radio station?  I'm going to ask.  Is every single person happy that we're on in Dallas?  Well, we're happy.  Everyone's happy.  Everyone seems happy.  It's a day on.  Yeah, well, we're pretty psyched to be back on in Dallas.  We were just starting to get something going when we got fired and all that.  Yeah.  Hey, do people know what nice guys you are in real life?  Yeah, they're starting to get that. 
[01:50:30]  We're allowing the listeners to see that part of us finally.  Well, they should because in radio, there aren't all that many people that aren't backbiting.  Except for you.  Well, Anthony, I don't know you.  I'm sorry.  I'm nicer than Opie, believe it or not.  But Opie and Norton.  So if you like Opie, you'll love me.  Huh?  Opie and Norton are the nicest guys.  Yeah, I know Pugs and Kelly well, and I am actually a very sweet boy.  We've never met.  I never went down there.  You guys went on a few field trips down there to Dallas. 
[01:51:00]  Yes.  Opie and I on our homoerotic travels.  I'm off.  I had no girlfriend.  He had no girlfriend.  Just two fags traveling across the country and staying in the same hotel.  Hey, Jimmy, where are you going to be this weekend?  Dallas?  All right.  I'll hop on the plane.  San Francisco?  I'm with you.  All right.  I'll go there.  A couple of queers.  Yeah, maybe that one wasn't a good idea.  But some horrid buddy movie with KY.  The best was going to Dealey Plaza for the first time, though.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  We did do that in Dallas.  Well, I mean, there's a story. 
[01:51:30]  Done to everybody when they go down there.  I also went down to Dallas with my two brothers, and they're like JFK fanatics.  And I figured, you know, they're into the JFK thing.  That's fine.  We'll go to Dealey Plaza for an hour, you know, maybe two.  Maybe two hours.  They're so obsessed.  We stayed there 12 hours.  Yeah, you know, the brothers are fantastic.  That's the entire day there.  The entire day we stayed at Dealey Plaza.  What were they taking tape measures out?  They were checking out every angle, and they were looking for marks on the sidewalk. 
[01:52:00]  Were they pointing?  There's the window.  Oh, all that stuff.  And then they were reenacting stuff with video cameras.  And that's got to be so hack for people that live down there, right?  Yeah, of course.  It's kind of like us going to the Statue of Liberty.  The observation deck of the Empire State Building.  Yeah, exactly.  You just don't do it.  Every city has that thing that you go to with out-of-towners.  Yeah.  There's actually an X in the street where apparently the headshot was.  And I took my picture standing there.  I kind of felt ridiculous, but I had to do it.  That's a little morbid. 
[01:52:30]  That's why the X is there.  They don't want idiots just, like, you know, moxing around in the middle of the street.  They're like, here, just stand there, get your picture taken, and leave.  And the best part is the commuters, they don't give a crap.  They don't care.  There's a light at the top of the hill.  The light turns green, and they're coming, flying down.  And there's stupid tourists, you know, on the X trying to get their picture taken.  Oh, the locals must just aim for them.  Because that would be annoying.  Imagine, like, you know, you're driving down the Long Island Expressway, and there's an X where Harry Chapin lost his head.  And people standing there trying to take pictures.  Out of my way. 
[01:53:00]  Driving here.  It's funny.  I think I cost Pugs and Kelly, but one time I was down there, I think I cost you guys a sponsor.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Well, they had a lovely sponsor.  It was a place where you would go if your back hurts.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, massage, genuine massage.  And I referenced it on the air.  Right, a genuine massage place, and you turned it into something filthy.  Yes, it was actually busted.  I'm sure on...  How long after I was there was it busted? 
[01:53:30]  Well, a couple months ago.  Okay.  Oh, they presented themselves as legit?  Not until...  As soon as I walked in the door, I knew exactly what it was.  I started filling up.  The minute I got through the door, it was fantastic.  I'm like, oh, this is great.  It just smells like ammonia.  Places like that smell like ammonia because the floors are so dirty and disgusting.  Jimmy has radar at massage parlors.  You'll learn...  People that don't know, you'll learn a lot about Jimmy.  He knows everything about massage parlors, and if he walks in, he can tell if it's a 
[01:54:00]  legit, you're just going to get a massage, or if it's kind of a covert that it's going  to be, you know, you give a little extra money, you're going to get a little extra something,  or if it's just a whorehouse.  That was just basically a whorehouse, and I referenced it on the air.  I went back and said something about those whores as a goof, because I love the place.  I raved about it.  I gave it a four-star review.  And they were advertising on Pugs and Kelly?  Yes.  Your four-star review pulled the ad.  Yeah, well, I said something about those whores over at that place.  Like, I referenced it later, and they got all sensitive.  Yeah, because they're playing it cool on the air, obviously. 
[01:54:30]  You know, they're just talking about it as a regular massage place.  Yeah, but it was like, don't be hypersensitive now.  I mean, you're prostitutes.  I'm not knocking that.  I think it's fantastic, and you should be.  But don't make fun of me or get pissed at me, because I referenced it as a joke.  If you're looking for whores.  Exactly.  Jimmy's live read.  Well, you need to come back.  All of you need to come back.  Yeah, Anthony needs to go for the first time, I think.  Yes, first timer.  Yeah, Dallas is definitely a cool city.  I'm going to stand on the X.  All it is is, like, churches and massage parlors. 
[01:55:00]  That's all it is.  It's actually really scary if you're into radio, because, you know, you do the radio gigs  at the bars and the clubs and stuff, and these guys show up with their cowboy hats, and  they're all armed.  I like that.  The women are armed.  The armed part, not so much.  They all have guns in their glove boxes, right?  Mm-hmm.  And they all have breast implants as well.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  You do.  Anything else, Pugs and Kelly?  Everyone, including. 
[01:55:30]  Right.  Anything else, guys?  No, guys.  Thank you for coming back.  Saving our morning show.  Really, my bonuses depend on it.  Oh, see?  And every single show is happy with that.  Everyone there, Opie.  Every single one, right?  Every single soul at that station is pleased as punch.  I love especially the guys that hate us that have never met us.  That's always very interesting.  Those laughs are so telling. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  They got to live with it.  Yeah, they got to work there.  Come on.  Hey, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Welcome back.  Thanks for being nice to me while we were off the air, too.  Oh, no, no.  Thank you.  No, Opie, you helped us a lot.  How?  You gave us advice.  Oh, yeah.  You scared us in the right direction.  Oh, that's...  We know that we can call you for any...  You're seriously the nicest guy.  How about taking some of your own advice, Opie?  Yeah.  Maybe we'll hold a job for more than a couple of years. 
[01:56:30]  And my brother wanted you so bad, Kelly.  Me?  Wow.  Yeah, he wanted you really bad.  Well, why didn't he ask me out?  Because you were dating a linebacker.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  I don't get in the way.  Yeah.  Well, I'm not anymore.  We have a lot of history with Pugs and Kelly.  We'll have to get into it on another show because...  Possibly another shot to the head in Dallas?  Well.  Or at least the face.  Continued success, guys.  Thank you, too.  We'll be in touch. 
[01:57:00]  Thank you so much for welcoming us back to Dallas.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  It's Pugs and Kelly, everyone.  Cool.  So, Pugs...  Yeah, where was he?  I don't know.  He was kind of quiet.  Yeah, they were very quiet.  That's a little weird.  I think we're going to have to earn our keep there.  I think it's not like Philly and Boston where we were there.  We were catching on, but I think we have to earn our keep there.  Well, the fact of the matter is they'll probably dump out of this in Dallas, but Russ Martin,  who does afternoons, is very, very paranoid. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  Extremely paranoid.  Oh, I remember that story.  Yeah, we'll go into that sometime.  He thought I was trying to get him fired behind the scenes, that old gag again, and that I was writing emails and stuff.  And it was proven that the emails weren't coming from me, but he still didn't believe it.  There was a whole thing that happened within the company behind closed doors.  It's like I haven't even met the guy.  You know how I solve all problems now?  I make people my MySpace friend.  And then they're friends. 
[01:58:00]  It says so right there on your MySpace thing.  You're a friend.  How can you get into a fight?  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  That's for me and Anthony.  No, mine is MySpace.com slash Anthony Cumia.  I was going to remember how to spell that.  All right, listen, we're running out of show.  Fat chicks, stop sending me MySpace.  I'm rejecting all of you.  Earlier this morning, we talked to Mr. Imus.  We linked up with Imus' fine program.  We've been trying to get Imus on our show.  For a year and a half. 
[01:58:30]  It finally happened today.  And there was awful technical problems.  Technical glitches.  Technical glitches.  And Imus was as frustrated as we were.  And this went down on his show a little while ago.  Imus in the morning program on the radio all over the country and on MSNBC.  I'm still irritated about we had this big plan to talk to Opie and Anthony.  But we did talk to them.  Yeah.  But we had some kind of audio problems.  They started over this morning. 
[01:59:00]  Why would I be promoting another morning for them?  I don't know.  That means bigger than all that.  Yeah.  I am bigger than all that.  And I like them a lot.  And, you know, we have other considerations.  What do you mean?  In the grand scheme of things.  We have the, you know.  Such as?  What are you saying?  Well, the stock.  We're, I mean, how about be able to, you know, screw boner nose. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  And the screw boner nose.  Exactly.  There you go.  Well, I don't, I didn't get a chance to tell Opie and Anthony, but I just, I hope they don't  say anything bad about Howard.  That would just be just horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It would have to be bigger than that.  Okay.  We already know you have onions, so.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  Iman's loves that he has a pit bull on his side now.  That's it.  I guess that's how it's going to end today.  We really got to move on to our next radio show. 
[02:00:00]  I'm going to need some help to carry my gifts.  It's a t-shirt.  Well, first day, I think, went quite well.  Yes.  David Hinkley.  Aside from my lousy voice.  Good radio show today?  He's giving us a thumbs up.  David Hinkley from the Daily News.  Nick Carter, anything?  You want to warn, like, other radio shows out there?  Oh, dude.  It's like, I heard it coming out of my radio this morning, but I just told Ant I had to  come in and see it to believe it.  This is like when Maverick and Goose get sent to Top Gun after buzzing the tower the second 
[02:00:30]  time.  Punch out.  You know, and honestly, how good is it to be white in this country?  Good point, Nick.  It is wonderful, Nick.  No, because had you guys been black, it would have been done in Boston.  Had you been Otho and Anfernee, you wouldn't have been able to listen to the radio, let  alone be on it again.  That was the names we were going to go under.  Yeah, it just didn't flow right.  Opie and Anthony, two multi-millionaires, his entire net worth is made up of severance 
[02:01:00]  from this country and this company.  Do you know, when I get cabs in the morning, I honestly take my hood off so they can see  my alabaster face.  All right, Nick.  No, I just wanted to say congratulations and big ups.  Thanks, Nick.  Thank you.  And that's how it ends today, our first show.  It went pretty well, man.  We have more to do.  Yeah, I want to thank all the free FM stations in New York, Dallas, Philadelphia, of course,  WBCN in Boston.  Our new affiliates being heard for the first time in Pittsburgh on WRKZ, West Palm Beach, 
[02:01:30]  the home of E-Rock's family, WPBZ, and of course, K-Rock in Cleveland.  Thank you so much.  And we'll see you tomorrow morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We'll see you tomorrow morning. 
[02:02:00]  And a cousin on the start  When the little kids are like this  Feet start swinging with the bars in the school  And your feet flying up in the air  Singin' hey diddle diddle  With your kitty in the middle  Of the swing like a diddle cab 
[02:02:30]  Start took a big chance  After high school dance  With a missin' who was ready to play  Was it mean shit foolin'  Cause she knew what she was doin'  And an old lover's here to save  But she told her to  Walk this way  Walk this way  Just give me a kiss  I like this 
[02:03:00]  And now, The Walk. 
[02:03:30]  Are we really live on XM right now?  I have no idea.  I would assume so, if we're yapping.  Eventually, we're just going to do a radio show.  It's 24 hours a day.  Why not?  Just keep wired for sound.  Just pick it up.  24 hours a day.  Hello, ONA.  Thank you.  How are you?  Pest.  How are you, guys?  Got a few pests out here. 
[02:04:00]  Come follow us to XM Satellite Radio.  Yes, let's go, Pest.  We don't have much time, I don't think.  Here we are, walking down lovely Midtown Manhattan.  How hacky is this, too?  Walk This Way is playing.  I know.  By the way, why don't we talk about the show we just did, Anthony?  That should hold those fuckers for a while, huh?  Oh, I forgot.  We could curse now.  I've been waiting all morning to curse. 
[02:04:30]  I can't wait to tell the Russ Martin story.  That guy hates us, and we don't even know why.  Yeah.  These photographers are very good at the backwards walk.  Yeah, I think they're used to doing this.  I'd love to see.  Yeah, we have photographers here, and they're just snapping away.  That guy screwed up a little bit, though.  That guy's drastically changing their paparazzi.  The paparazzo.  The paparazzo.  We got video cameras.  I think he just stole that camera. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, this guy.  He doesn't look like he does that professionally.  Watch this guy's getting back into the bus thing.  Oh, damn.  I was holding.  Oh.  Wow, look at it.  They work together.  As a team.  That's nice.  You got to love the commuters.  They could have sold that one guy out.  They're like, what the hell is going on today?  Who are these guys?  Well, that's it.  I guess that's the end of our Walk This Way song.  Are they going to play These Boots Are Made for Walkin' Next?  I was thinking Walk the Line.  Walk on the wild side.  Walk the line.  There's plenty of...  How it sucks!  How it sucks! 
[02:05:30]  Well, that must be a pest chance going.  How it sucks!  It's good to see our listeners still don't have jobs.  Nothing?  Hey, this bus is in our way.  It's messing up our dramatic walk to XM Satellite Radio.  Now we're stuck on the corner.  No, we're not.  Let's go.  Ah, here we go.  Don't mind us, people.  Don't mind us.  We're almost at...  Boy, I sure as shit hope this isn't a daily thing. 
[02:06:00]  I do not want to broadcast the goddamn walk back and forth every time.  Well, Don Wicklund is walking right next to us.  Tomorrow, I want to see how good you are.  Cross at the green, not in between.  I want a high school marching band to make the walk with us tomorrow.  Let's see what you can accomplish tomorrow, all right?  And where's little Jimmy Norton?  Get Jimmy Norton in here.  Where is little Jimmy Norton?  He's very depressed because the presents from Philly weren't that great. 
[02:06:30]  He got a t-shirt.  Oh, thank God.  This is being broadcast on satellite.  Oh.  Oh, one of the photographers almost took an endo over a fire hydrant.  Hey, is that Whitney Houston or a homeless person?  You know, this walk is really going to blow.  This is going to get old real fast.  Yeah.  How many of you guys are doing the walk tomorrow?  All right, one person.  That's good, see?  Please.  Can we do it at a different time so we can lose them? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  And now we've got TV crews outside the XM Satellite facility.  Really?  And one beautiful blonde.  Oh, boy.  I just itched my nose.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to look like I was picking my nose, and that will be the one they use in the paper, by the way.  A lot of it.  Yeah, now we've got to put on, like, the looks like we're serious broadcasters. 
[02:07:30]  Yes.  Very good.  Very serious broadcasters.  Gentlemen, we must go upstairs.  We've got to thank the O&A Pest.  Guys, thank you so much.  Thanks, Pest.  We've got to be upstairs in 30 seconds?  Yeah, 30 seconds.  Thanks, man.  All right.  There they go as we go upstairs.  Are these going to work in the elevator, too?  I hope not.  Jiminy Cricket.  Let's just keep talking until it fades out.  Well, that was kind of interesting. 
[02:08:00]  I didn't like the walk part.  I like the walk part, actually.  Enough with the walk part.  I like the walk part.  XM202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.

The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:08:30]  All right. 
[02:09:00]  We remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log they're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  Indeed.  Oh.  With O.B.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  She ignores me.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros. 
[02:09:30]  Good old Ben.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:10:00]  Our lives suck.  I just realized that.  I just sat down in front of this microphone.  What the hell?  Enough of this palaver.  Oh my god.  This is like aerobics.  Did that time out perfect?  Oh my god.  Wow.  I just realized for the first time that we made an awful deal. 
[02:10:30]  You know what?  We're going to have to actually work.  Unbelievable.  All right.  Welcome to the second part of the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  Exclusively on XM Satellite Radio.  Bill Burr in studio.  I don't know what the hell is going on.  Half our staff is still walking from Free FM here in New York City.  I thought we had a really, really good first show. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  It's kind of awkward because we're just not used to the facility.  We're not used to the equipment.  We're not used to all the eyes that are staring at us.  Yeah.  It's a little weird.  From people we don't even know yet.  Don't quite know them.  And then the brass.  There's some brass around there.  There's not much brass around this studio.  No.  We don't have any bosses here.  No.  By the way.  And you know what we always say.  Fuck.  Fuck the bosses.  Fuck.  Fuck. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, Billy.  Hello, Anthony.  How you been, man?  Just let it fly.  Get it out.  I was holding.  I heard you guys had no dumps.  We had absolutely no dumps on CBS.  Look at you guys.  Are you kidding?  There was not one dump?  And we weren't really.  We're going to have to do better, guys.  Jesus.  What are we, insane?  I saw Jimmy's face a couple of times and he saw mine where we knew we could have said something  right then and there.  Yeah, it was about to get awful.  Now we can say it because they didn't dump. 
[02:12:00]  What I was going to say there, I wouldn't even said on XM.  It was a Cynthia McKinney line.  It was just, I love you.  That's what it was.  Wow.  So, uh.  Wow.  Well, we ended the first part of the show from another studio about a block away from here.  You know, if you haven't figured that out yet, we're now doing the show from two studios  every single day.  Yeah.  I don't know how long that's going to last.  And all of a sudden we said goodbye and next thing you know, like the whole staff, it's  like, uh, it's like the pits. 
[02:12:30]  Got a NASCAR race.  Pit crew.  The pit crew just went nuts, uh, collecting all our stuff.  They're still walking over here.  We take the elevator down.  The ONA pass.  Mm-hmm.  A fine, fine showing.  Yeah.  Outside the building with-  Out there with signs.  Open Anthony signs and stuff.  I think we got video and, uh, pictures of that.  Yeah.  Right off the bat, I feel so much more comfortable in here, I gotta tell you.  Well, that's what it is.  It's the comfort level.  Like, we gotta get-  We gotta get used to that over there.  You guys are like a Vegas act that just plays at the same casino for like ten years. 
[02:13:00]  You finally, like, your contract's up, you get booted out.  And we go to some other place.  Yeah.  It really is, uh, strange, though, being over there.  It's, uh, different surroundings and everything.  But, uh, that was a lot of fun.  It was definitely cool.  And then they handed us mics.  The pests are, uh, wishing Anthony a very happy birthday.  Yeah, wonderful.  And, uh, we started the walk and there's paparazzi all over the place.  Paparazzo.  They're snapping pictures. 
[02:13:30]  They're snapping pictures like crazy.  There's five or six of them.  Actually, there's one in the studio right now.  One in here right now.  Oh, I get my hot water with honey and lemon because my, uh, I was sick.  I've been sick.  Oh, yeah.  I've been sick.  Yeah, I don't even know how you pulled it off this morning.  And then we made the walk and all the commuters were just staring at us like, what is going on?  Yeah.  Because, uh, yeah, everybody's kind of coming into work.  Right.  So they, uh, they see us marching down the street with photographers taking pictures and a crowd of freaks behind us. 
[02:14:00]  They don't know what to make of it.  And then there was video crews and, uh...  Yeah, at the, uh, front door.  That was, that was very, very impressive.  And what, now these guys want to take pictures in here?  Yeah, have them come in.  What the hell?  Snap away.  Snap away.  It's only, uh, it's only the XM audience.  Right.  They'll wait as we get our pictures taken.  You poor bastards.  Don't you feel so neglected?  Yeah, exactly.  Don't they feel so neglected, Opie? 
[02:14:30]  Maybe we should raffle off my, uh, YSP gift.  Yeah, you weren't happy about the YSP gift at all.  And I don't blame you.  I wanted to wrap it around my finger and put it in my asshole and hand it back.  Why would you be happy with that?  But in all fairness, you got a $50 Starbucks card.  That's lovely.  Yeah, what, what good is that going to do?  But our gifts didn't cost $50.  It's not a money issue.  You just wanted quantity?  Just a, that sweatshirt, it was worthless.  I, I wanted to give you my sweatshirt.  I can't take yours.  Why?  It's a gift from me now, Jimmy.  I know, but it's just too creepy and it's too needy. 
[02:15:00]  It's nice of you to do because you're a good friend, but it's just too needy.  So if they send one up, will, will you accept that?  I'll fucking give it to a homeless person.  That guy, that Jewish guy that stands out to it with a pit bull?  Yeah.  I'll encourage the dog to shit on it.  Where, where are you guys from, by the way?  Associated Press is here.  AP.  AP?  Wait, let me take off my Breathe Right strip.  They're taking pictures of me for the first time.  Oh my God, you got your dopey Breathe Right strip on.  Could you get a picture?  Oh man.  They already got a bunch of them with his Breathe Right on.  Opie Anthony and douchebag friend. 
[02:15:30]  He's got the sinuses of a hummingbird.  At least they took your picture.  I feel like Kevin Federline over here.  Why?  Don't you know this guy?  He's the host of the soup.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny.  He's Chris Titus.  You don't recognize this guy?  He had a failed sitcom.  All right.  You guys good?  They're good.  They're good.  You want to get an action shot?  Hold on, you got to get an action shot.  Yeah, there's an action shot right there.  Come on, action.  These are very hard to come by.  Oh my God.  You motherfucker. 
[02:16:00]  That's right.  That's staged.  I stood up and they still pointed that way with their cameras.  Do you know how hurtful that is?  Jimmy, they're taking your picture.  Ooh.  Yeah.  You've got a celebrity next to you.  Would you like him to pose?  If you did.  He's really good at posing.  Jimmy, give him one pose.  Here, here's Jimmy's pose for you guys.  I think one shot of Jimmy.  This is the position Jim is in when he says most of his funny stuff.  Look at him read the newspaper.  You are terrible.  That's the one they're going to use.  You know that. 
[02:16:30]  By the way, star of Lucky Louie.  One of the stars of Lucky Louie, a brand new HBO series.  Of course.  He's going to be starting up in the summer.  Jimmy?  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  And if you want some good photos, if I'm ever famous, find out where the transgendered  hang out.  You'll certainly have some lovely star photos for me.  Yeah, we've got some addresses to give to the paparazzi for, for little Jimmy Norton  and where he hangs out.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  All right.  There they go.  Gentlemen, this is a pleasure.  This is beyond weird.  You guys are good.  Not too intrusive. 
[02:17:00]  I like that.  I like that.  Were any of you at the federal court building during my divorce?  No.  Oh, good.  I want to know what other pictures they have on those reels.  Right?  Thank you.  Oh, I know.  All right.  So long, guys.  We'll be at the federal court tonight.  Actually, it's Supreme.  What's going on over there?  Late Supreme.  Oh, Supreme?  Oh, okay.  Oh, hey.  That's a good one.  67.  All right.  Wow.  Nice.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Oh, wait.  Oh. 
[02:17:30]  Well, that killed the 10 minutes.  That's right.  Well, people, I hate to tell you all this, but we already did a show.  Yeah.  You got any best stuff to shoot up?  So, like, we're kind of tired.  You know, I know you're getting the short end of the stick, and the show won't be as  good, and we're not going to do anything fun because we blew our load already.  Shut up.  Dude, did I tell you what happened in my massage, my stupid steam room in my building? 
[02:18:00]  No.  I'll tell you tomorrow morning at about 6.30.  It's a very, very funny story.  It's got intrigue.  We really got to go right to the phones here and take our abuse.  Tony in Pennsylvania, what's up?  Let her rip.  You guys got dumped out at the end of the show when Nick Carter said, suck an ass?  Oh, really?  No, we didn't.  Well, no, now, here in New York, they might not have dumped out, but he's calling from 
[02:18:30]  where, Philly?  Well, I'm driving through Pennsylvania, and I switched over to YSP.  Yeah, so YSP might have punched out.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, YSP might have dumped out.  It's their prerogative.  No, that was the only dump then.  So, all right, thank you, sir.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy in Boston.  Jimmy, what's going on today?  How are you doing, guys?  Good show.  Thank you.  Hey, I wanted to tell you, they dumped out on the Nick Carter comment in Boston on BCN.  All right.  A lot of them, mate, they have that option.  I mean, it's up to them, and XM is going to get everything. 
[02:19:00]  Oh, you're going to say something.  Yeah, it's good.  It made it good.  Hey, Anthony, I just want to let you know, great, great job considering you're sick, and  that was really great.  I really tip my back to you.  Thank you, my friend.  The interview with Bill Donahue was great.  It was great.  That was awesome.  And I want to tell you, Dice was on Stern this morning, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I got both services, and I love both of you guys, but I listen to both of them  back and forth.  It's a dilemma now, because now I've got to put my damn Wi-Fi on, because it only holds 
[02:19:30]  five hours.  Now I've got six hours of show to record.  Right.  Well, what did Dice have to say today?  No, I didn't listen.  I listened to you guys.  Is he going to beat us up?  What is he going to do now?  What is this fucking fraud going to do now?  How is he spinning this into, we're working a hot dog stand in Vegas?  Well, he's not over here.  He's over there now.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Insert Anthony Dice impression here.  All right.  Cool.  Of course, I can't do it.  Nice job.  Keep going.  I won't be able to talk.  What kind of cake is this guy?  We got two cheesecakes.  And by the way, who's the guy's short arms? 
[02:20:00]  Whatever his name is.  You know the intern we have?  Big heads, short arms.  Yeah.  He's awfully misshapen.  And he's carrying Anthony's birthday cheesecake across the street.  And he's putting it on top of a box.  And his stupid face is right over it.  He didn't even cover it.  Oh, boy.  They're short arms.  Why didn't you, dude, why didn't you cover the cheesecake?  I asked him in the elevator.  He's breathing on it.  Jimmy, he was very busy.  As you could see, he was a little short-handed. 
[02:20:30]  So he had to carry both himself.  I'm sorry.  I was just told to pick up everything and run over here.  Yeah.  What kind of cake is this?  I have no idea.  Did you snap at a Jeep on your way here?  Jeff Goldblum saying, drive faster.  What kind of cake is that, though, Keith?  You better just cut me off a little piece so I can try it.  No, no, I'm actually on the Fat Smash Diet.  But I just want to try a piece for reference.  When will the Fat Smash Diet begin?  Tomorrow.  For sure.  We're eating all fruit today.  Liar, liar. 
[02:21:00]  Pants on fire.  Liar, liar.  Fat stomach on fire.  Two cakes.  And Bill Burr's got the cheesecake in front of him.  I'm certainly having a piece of that.  It's a celebration.  Thanks, Bill.  Yeah.  I would need the cheesecake.  I don't like the open air.  Oh, no, no.  Just because they got carried down 57th Street by a short-armed man coughing.  Oh, like that?  Just on a paper plate?  I'm not even talking about the asbestos from the drum brakes, the brake drums, all on 57th  as it was marched down the filthiest street in New York City.  But the fact that the candle was lit and I blew it out. 
[02:21:30]  I wouldn't care if you shot your load on it.  It's New York cheesecake.  Well, I was going to get to number three.  The filling.  It is creamy.  Hey, E-Rock has made it from the other facility, the other studio.  Oh, thank you.  And anything, any news, E-Rock?  No.  Oh.  Do we have any news about how come K-Rock, Free FM, had some bottles of water and yet  we don't have them here?  Get the station right before you compliment them.  Whatever it is. 
[02:22:00]  Who knows?  Free FM over there.  Yeah, we got to pit the two companies against each other.  That's right.  And then they'll both agree and just fire us.  Free FM gives us water in bottles.  That's right.  I was never at a lack of water.  Always had everything we needed.  Absolutely.  The studio is really weird over there because it's so echoey.  You got to stay right on the mic.  And it's big.  It's huge.  It's like, yeah, it's at least five or six times the size of this studio.  He's holding the cake with his thumb.  I, my thumb did not touch the cake. 
[02:22:30]  It did.  I saw it.  Give me your thumb.  It's very, okay.  It's very rich, the cake, and Keith's trying to cut it.  So he's holding the one piece of his thumb so he doesn't pull it.  Oh, Keith bombed horribly on that show today.  Filthy perp's arm was on that thumb.  Absolutely.  He's got his nuttle in it, too.  He probably picked a homeless guy up by the ball bag and asshole with that hand.  By the way, that was a big thumbprint in your cake.  Keith the Cop cutting the cake is on Pal Talk right now.  A lot of people were asking, first part of the show today, where was the Pal Talk cameras? 
[02:23:00]  I know.  I had said that our first show was going to be on Pal Talk, but it's nothing to do with  any censorship or anything.  They're hooking up the computers that we need to run Pal Talk.  So the second that is hooked up, you will be able to tune into Pal Talk and watch us in  the studio.  And we're actually doing a new system for our free FM fans.  We'll see if you guys find out about it.  All the poor XM people.  Yeah, let's go to Chicago. 
[02:23:30]  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Thanks for working so hard.  I wanted to say, you know, I'm so sick of people bitching about, oh, I paid for this  XM and now you guys are going to sell out.  I mean, I have a sick kid, right?  I mean, I have one hour during the day when I get to fucking laugh.  And it's with you guys.  Kevin.  In fact, you know, if you're...  Yeah.  What's wrong with your kid?  Oh, no.  He's got autism.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[02:24:00]  No, no.  Wow.  What a scumbag.  What I'm saying is, if your best friend did something, you know, got something good,  right?  If your best friend did something well, would you be happy for them?  I'm just so sick of these, you know, these fucking people bitching about the, you know,  the pennies they got to throw a day.  And you guys are working extra for us now.  Look, our XM people, we got to say, we're bullshitting them the last few days about,  fuck you, but they've been there for 18 months.  I mean, we really do want them to be...  Most of them are happy for us.  And the fact that we now don't care about them anymore, I mean, it's not a personal thing. 
[02:24:30]  But in all seriousness, let's just sum it up.  I mean, this just brings so much more content to the radio program itself.  Yeah, it's really a lot more of the show.  So if you don't like what you're hearing, you're still going to get more of it.  We get to talk to people that hate us.  What do you want, good show or more show?  I say more show.  Well, listen, seriously, let's get into this for just a second, and then we can, whatever. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, you get more content for the show in general, like people just absolutely hating us,  so you get that tension.  We got other radio shows across America that we definitely will be focusing on big time,  and the ONAPES will get involved with that.  A few battles.  We're going to get bigger guests, bigger prizes.  You know, it's just going to get much more interesting.  And I think if you're really a faithful fan of this show, you should just kind of enjoy,  you know, the process that is going to happen in the coming months.  Enjoy the ride. 
[02:25:30]  Just enjoy it.  You get to watch the growth.  Some people weren't at the beginning of our XM career.  Now you get to see the beginning of this.  Right.  And you get to see the progression.  And listen how much more comfortable we are right now.  Yeah.  We're feeling a little awkward in that other studio, but that's going to change.  That changes.  What does Madonna say?  You're just peeling back another layer.  Another layer.  Is that what she says?  Artistic.  Plus, you guys are breaking your ass, and we're in life. 
[02:26:00]  Do you guess?  She probably says it like, you're peeling back another layer.  Yeah, with a fake accent.  Oi, oi.  That's what I say then.  That's a sponge, Jimmy.  She absorbs the atmosphere of where she is.  All right, Kevin.  Exactly.  So she will also make shit movies like her dumb husband.  Thank you, dude.  Sucks.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thanks, bud.  All right.  There goes Kevin from Chicago.  Eric's got a good point.  That is really funny.  Line one.  Eric, sir.  Good morning, boys.  Congratulations again.  Thank you, man. 
[02:26:30]  Well, two things.  When will Patrice O'Neill be appearing on K-Rock on Free FM?  Well, it says Patrice will never get on CBS.  That's what you're...  Yeah, well, I asked, does Patrice O'Neill ever stand the chance of being on K-Rock?  Yeah, he was on Letterman.  He did panel on Letterman.  I mean, Patrice knows how to be funny clean.  All these guys have done regular radio, sir.  They, you know, they go all across the country. 
[02:27:00]  Well, maybe not Patrice.  They go all over, though, and do radio, regular radio, where they can't curse.  But there were a few things that came up in our meeting with the lawyer yesterday where Patrice's name came up.  And I believe a clip of some of his audio has to be sent over there to see if certain things are good, not good.  So Patrice is like some kind of a benchmark they're going with.  Do you guys ever need a car to drive you over?  I can volunteer myself.  We do.  Just leave your number. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  Yeah, hold on a second.  We'll get that number.  All right?  Okay.  Oops.  Tomorrow we want a high school marching band.  We want to get really hacky tomorrow.  A marching band.  Really hacky.  And we'll acknowledge it's going to be really hacky.  You want to get hacky.  Or the bagpipes.  Bagpipes.  Get the old bagpipes.  I think marching band's a little more hacky.  Twirlers.  Twirlers.  Don't they have baton twirlers?  The guys with the cymbals. 
[02:28:00]  That's what we say.  Some rickshaws.  What?  Some rickshaws.  So we don't have to walk.  That's how we should be pulled over.  We should be.  Fat girls pulling us in rickshaws.  Book it.  Make it happen.  Rickshaws.  Make it happen.  We want fat girls pulling us in rickshaws.  Oh, no.  The new rickshaws.  The new rickshaws.  They're kind of on bikes.  The pedal bike ones?  Yeah, the bike taxis, whatever they're called.  I just want to stare at that big cellulite ass.  As she's trying to pedal up that hill.  Don Wicklund better be writing these ideas down. 
[02:28:30]  Bike taxi, fat girls in bikinis.  Make it happen.  Whips.  Make it happen.  Already looks overworked.  We want to see how good you are.  Just bring in like seven of yours for everybody on the crew.  If you're just tuning in.  Whips.  The first half of the show we do on terrestrial radio.  And then we come over here and there's a walk.  And we're going to broadcast it from time to time.  Today it was 0 and a pass.  Some of the pass will probably show up tomorrow.  It might get bigger.  It might get smaller in the crowd.  Who knows?  People work.  But we want to get a high school marching band. 
[02:29:00]  We want to get the bagpipes.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  And we need the pedal rickshaws.  You know those things you see?  But pedaled by fat chicks in bikinis.  Because we want to see their big fat asses pedaling down the street.  The fatter the better.  Yeah.  Big fat one.  Make sure you put that on the breakdown too when you're looking for the talent.  Oh.  Okay.  I actually had an idea.  For instead of the walk when you guys want to make it a little bit quicker.  Get some of those segues. 
[02:29:30]  And do the segway thing.  Have you guys on the wheel.  Oh the little two wheeled segway?  The two wheeled things?  Yeah.  That sounds like a death trap.  Nice.  We'll drive it down to 57.  What's your segway?  That two wheeled little vehicle.  Jimmy.  Don't spit your cake out of me.  The segway is the vehicle of the homo.  Yeah.  No one looks cool on a segway.  Get it.  Book it.  No one looks cool on those segways.  They're awful.  And it's an awful idea.  I like it. 
[02:30:00]  And someday in the future.  Rocket packs.  You've never seen the segway?  It's that two wheeled thing that you stand on a little platform.  It's got handlebars.  Oh yeah yeah.  I'm trying to picture a car with two wheeled.  It balances itself.  I'd rather run over on a car.  How's it going to tip over?  Yeah.  How doesn't it tip over?  Let's go to Scott in Cincinnati.  Scott you're on the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah.  Morning guys.  Good morning Scott.  I just wanted to say one thing about the FM deal.  And I congratulate you.  I just personally know.  Yeah.  I think it stinks. 
[02:30:30]  And I don't like it.  Oh boy.  You'll get used to it.  My Sky Fi doesn't delay enough to take care of the commercial.  Alright.  Well you gotta just give it some time.  I really believe that it brings a lot more content to the show.  And I think it's going to be terrific radio in the coming months.  And when we get a library.  I think you've got a great opportunity man.  I think it's going to be pretty awesome.  We've got to get on FM in Cincinnati.  Cincinnati.  Wait.  You want us to get on FM in Cincinnati but you don't like that we're doing...  And then he hung up and left it a big mystery. 
[02:31:00]  I hope it's a big mystery.  For about two seconds.  Let's go to Kevin in Boston.  Kevin.  Hey.  How you doing guys?  Hey man.  Kev.  Hey.  I was wondering...  What are you guys going to do when you guys have a blizzard?  You've got to walk over to XM.  You've got to put your tennis racket shoes on.  Cross country skiing.  Dog sleds.  Three hour show.  XM best of.  A three hour show.  All right, Kevin.  All right.  You guys are great. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you.  Be good, Kev.  Bye-bye.  Thank you.  Kurt saying you sounded uncomfortable in the street, Anthony.  Is that true?  Anthony, you've got to give him a break.  He's really...  I mean, he's really, really sick.  I am so ill.  He's being a real trooper today but he...  Ill.  He only gets sick...  You get sick not even once a year.  No.  Like once every two, three years.  No.  And today was the day.  Today.  Thanks.  Worked out great times.  You should have played the lottery today.  I think Ant was a little scared.  I did.  And that was his body's way of showing his fear.  It was his body just went into a big shambles. 
[02:32:00]  I was scared, Jimmy.  His body was scared.  All right, let's go.  Anthony's scared.  He poops a lot.  It's all liquid.  Let's go to Trent in Ohio.  Trent.  How you doing, sir?  Guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, love the show.  I've been...  I've listened to you on XM since you guys came off the premium last year.  I discovered you guys in Aurora, Ohio, 2002, and I thought you guys were really, really  funny, and now this free FM, and now doing this two-hour show and everything, I think 
[02:32:30]  you guys are going to be like the kings of all media, beating the hell out of Howard.  We might actually take that name.  That sounds like something that might take off.  The kings of media.  Wow.  I never heard that.  All right.  I like it.  Thank you, Trent.  Punch it out.  Okay.  And finally, we could...  Because we're finally relaxed.  We're breathing again.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Ladies and gentlemen.  We didn't give you the proper intro there, Bill.  I'm sorry.  Bill Burr.  Hello, Bill.  Finally.  Coming back to the show.  For a whirlwind tour of Funny Bones.  Where the hell you been? 
[02:33:00]  You know what?  We were just missing each other.  Yeah.  I know that's one of the hackiest things to say in show business.  Not just missing.  I was missing you a lot.  Well, we would call you up.  You got sick.  I see.  That's what it was.  That's why I got sick.  You were pining.  It was this dress.  I was pining.  Fourth mic.  Pining to 1846.  I've been reading a little bit later.  I was pining for you.  We would call Bill up every once in a while when Jimmy was out of town.  And you were always at another Funny Bone or doing your own thing in L.A.  I don't know what happens. 
[02:33:30]  And then I was in L.A.  And then I'd come back.  And then you guys were on vacation.  Yeah, we'd do that.  And Ben Sparks told me to go fuck myself.  And we didn't speak for a couple of weeks.  Had nothing to do with you guys.  Me and Ben had a little falling out.  Did you really?  Oh, yeah.  You banned me?  Anything that could possibly happen?  I banned him from MySpace, yeah.  From my MySpace.  Why?  He kicked me right off of MySpace.  Why?  Lost all my friends.  So I'm trying to get him back.  There's something with his friends.  Something with the friend list.  He didn't have me up there or something. 
[02:34:00]  I wasn't.  Yeah, I didn't put him in his top eight.  Yeah, I was very angry.  He's a very vindictive guy.  And I'll tell you, he only asked for shit once.  That's it.  And then your whole world gets turned upside down.  Don't ask twice.  What happened with you and Ben?  Yeah, what happened with you and Ben?  Did you think something was sugar in his apartment and throw it out?  We needed that, Ben.  We're going to find it.  Why weren't you invited over to the non-cursing show? 
[02:34:30]  Well, you know.  No trust?  I'm one of those comedians when I get on stage, I dress all in black.  I mean, I don't need to go any further than that.  Black leather?  I'm dangerous.  I walk the line.  Big cock showing?  Oh, yeah.  I'm a big advocate of the First Amendment, you know, and I exercise it.  Yeah.  Bravo to you, Ben.  I saw Bill Burr at 9 o'clock.  I'm like, Bill Burr at 9 o'clock?  Bill Burr is a guy that could come in over there.  Bill.  Without a problem.  I got some news for you, by the way.  Have I been demoted to 9 o'clock? 
[02:35:00]  8.45.  You're our 9 o'clock guy.  Oh, God.  No, to be completely honest, you should have been at the other place with us,  but we just figured that, you know, there's a lot of confusion.  We would just start with us three and then expand from there.  You know, and people did come in, and we didn't plan on that, but, no,  we'll have you over there sooner than later.  But we were in Boston recently.  That speech you just gave me is the same speech I get after every audition. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, we're going to have you back.  Now, dude, if it was up to me, you know, you would have been the lead,  but, you know, I got some other projects coming up, and I'm telling you.  We're going to call you back for those.  Yeah.  Okay, great, guys.  Thanks.  All right, take care.  Take care.  Windshield.  Bill who?  So we were in Boston broadcasting live,  and we're getting out of the hotel for the big ride from Boston to New York,  and here comes old Jimmy Norton out of the hotel,  wearing a Boston Red Sox cap.  Yeah, that's right. 
[02:36:00]  Yes.  He had bought one.  Same one, actually.  Exactly the same one Billy has.  And that just...  So what are you doing with that?  If I just admit to it, it's not going to be a problem?  No, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  No, no, no, no, no.  See how he did that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I've always kind of liked the Red Sox, and they're kind of winning, so I like them.  Oh, okay.  No, here's what happened.  Please, I'd normally rather wear a fucking bedpan on my head,  but I was out eating with Ant and a few other people in the restaurant we were in. 
[02:36:30]  Was it the crush of your fame?  No.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  No.  We were outside of Fenway Park, and there was actually sunlight coming in through the window,  and I have contacts.  I didn't have sunglasses.  I needed a cap so I could eat because the sun was in my face, and I'm like, I'm going  to bite the bullet, and there was no other.  When else are you going to buy it?  Outside of Fenway Park.  As a baseball fan, and I'm going to go out on a limb here, I'm going to say that's still  unacceptable.  What would you do?  You'd have to eat.  There was no other hat with a brim.  There was outside of Fenway Park, nothing.  Everything had to be on it.  No.  You could have gone to the Gap and got one of those sweatshop masks. 
[02:37:00]  Dude, we were in a restaurant.  I really want it.  He really likes the look of that cap and decide to buy one.  Listen to me.  I would tie tampons to my head if I had to, but there was nothing there that Boston Red  Sox had.  It was outside of Fenway.  I couldn't go to a Gap.  We were sitting at the restaurant.  Look, you're in Boston.  It's a very historic place.  You could have bought one of those Samuel Adams wigs.  Oh, see?  That's right.  I turned it around backwards so it was filled in my eyes.  The Freedom Trail was right outside your hotel.  The Freedom Trail.  I didn't know until we were in the restaurant that that was going to be an issue. 
[02:37:30]  You could have made a paper hat or something.  Listen, you guys can give me the business all you want.  There was nothing else to do.  Do you think a Boston Red Sox fan hanging out in New York, suns in his eyes, would go  in and buy a Yankee cap and put it on his head?  I think he would.  No.  No.  I think he would.  No, we wouldn't.  He'd sooner get cancer, he should only get cancer as well.  Was he wearing his Al-Qaeda sweatshirt?  Yeah.  That's not true.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  Let's go to Lance in Florida.  Lance!  Hey, Lance.  Hey.  Go in, Flair.  First thing I've got to say.  Come on, hurry up.  She's dying on me, Lance.  No, I want to tell you guys, I just joined XM and you guys are great and I think I did  it at the right time.  I got the both.  Ah.  You should have rehearsed this.  The XM coming back and the XM, I get to hear all the history of both things, you know,  and I love it.  I think there's going to be a lot of excitement.  Bring back, Cowhead.  I mean, we got a lot of energy because of this new deal and we're very, very psyched. 
[02:38:30]  Bring back, Cowhead.  Is that what he said?  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, I got an idea.  Remember the Godfather 2 when they were doing that march with the San Gennaro march?  You can have Anthony, like, walk with that hat, that gangster hat waving his hand and  you have that real hacky Italian band, like that over-the-top San Gennaro feast type of  march going to the studio, the studio.  That would be funny.  Yeah, we're going to do some stupid things and I feel that gets old and then we'll move 
[02:39:00]  on.  Why don't you walk up the street one day with, like, little pieces of two-by-four in your  hand, like the working man who's had enough.  Oh, yeah.  Had enough.  And a bunch of people in those, uh, I put fucking hubcaps on cars, that blue collar.  Yeah.  Like we're going to bust up a strike or something.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You know what we should do?  Walk up.  Adam backwards like Stallone.  Walk up the street with one really large pane of glass.  Seen in every stupid movie and then the car comes, oh, are they going to make it across 
[02:39:30]  with the pane of glass?  I don't know.  That's hacky.  Yeah, we'll get hacky with that for a few days and then that'll get old and then, uh,  and then we, uh, then we just walk.  And then we just walk.  I didn't know I had a mic.  I didn't see a mic.  You had a mic.  They were...  No, no, I didn't know.  I didn't see.  Everyone was yelling, where's Jimmy?  Oh, I didn't know.  I didn't see.  You guys stopped for pictures and I always feel stupid going, walking.  Like when two guys are having the photo taken, you don't want to walk back and go,  oh, I didn't see one.  But you should.  You're part of this program. 
[02:40:00]  You don't like to do that.  It's silly.  Speaking of pictures, who's the young gentleman in the studio?  You're strapping, young gentleman.  You're from the New York Post?  Oh, we'll give you a great photo.  The Post.  How come the Post hates us?  So I'm going to adjust my seat over near you so maybe half of my head can get us.  A little bit in it, in the picture?  Yeah.  So it can be on page 119 of the Post?  I'm Pervy Pal.  And that's Dopey Opie, as per the Post.  I feel like Chuck on Happy Days. 
[02:40:30]  Remember that guy who just kind of...  Disappeared?  Oh.  Wait.  Make sure you get this picture.  Oh, jeez.  Daily News is all over the studio.  Oh, they'll do that.  Because they know how to cover the Opie and Anthony show.  They always show celebrities reading the paper, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony's now posing with the New York Post in front of him.  That's...  No, you should be reading it upside down.  I'm laughing, because it's such a pleasure to read.  Read it upside down, because that would be crazy. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, that's wacky.  Look, look.  Look how silly they are.  He's a nudge.  I don't even know it's upside down.  But be very serious.  Like, you're really reading.  No, I like that.  Trying to figure it out.  Because you guys have such a wacky take on the news.  It's like you turn everything on its ear.  Oh, on its ear.  Thank you.  He's trying to work pining into that again.  Pining.  Why did I eat that cake?  But the diet starts tomorrow.  Jimmy's beating himself up over the cake.  Did you see that cake?  Yeah. 
[02:41:30]  It was huge.  It was like a quadruple chocolate, and he just took those Nestle chocolate chips.  It was like 10 bags just surrounding the outside of it.  And I also had a piece of cheesecake.  You're on the...  I'm on the Fat Smash diet.  You sure are, Jimmy.  I smash it into my mouth.  You sure are.  Dr. Ian Smith is not going to be happy with you.  He shouldn't be.  He's coming by with Michael Strahan on Friday, I believe.  I'll be here.  Yeah.  He's now filming Celebrity Fit Club, and he called yesterday and wants to see how everyone's  diets are doing. 
[02:42:00]  I got my first physical in like 15 years.  Uh-oh.  And did you get it?  No, no.  I was all cool.  But in the end, he went to go take blood, and he just goes, you know, I'm going to test  your cholesterol, blah, blah, and you know, I'll check for all STDs, HIV, and all  that stuff.  Is that okay with you?  So I had to be like, yeah, yeah, that's cool.  Yeah, it's fine.  Go ahead.  I can't be like, no.  No.  You can't believe the whores I've banged without condoms.  I don't want to know.  Are you in the demo now with the checkup where he, uh, did he get the finger?  Oh, no, I didn't.  Just call it the lucky demo. 
[02:42:30]  I'm really trying to put that off.  I figure my cholesterol's good.  That means my, you know, my prostate's fine.  Isn't that how that works?  My prostate's fine.  My good cholesterol levels were up.  That's odd.  Did you think he was going to do it, or did you have a rundown?  Did you have a program of what he was going to do?  No, no.  Get your programs.  You can't just do that.  That has to be.  I, what?  No, only when he asked my age.  Bill, I'm 37.  Yeah.  And you know what?  He started checking me out.  That starts at 40.  Bill, it happened last year.  Like, I thought the physical was done, and he turned his back away from me or whatever, 
[02:43:00]  and reached for the plastic glove, not good.  Yeah.  I peeked on his sheet.  Well, we told the story on the air, so he does what he has to do, and now he's got to  hold the hand that was inside you, like, up in the air, so it doesn't touch anything,  and he has a lab coat, and he has, like, a blood sample or something in the other hand,  so now he's trying to get the door, and then his lab coat gets stuck in the door as  he's trying to leave.  Why didn't you request at least a woman? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Can you request a woman?  I don't know.  I didn't even know.  Let out a pleasurable moan.  Or a doctor dressed.  That broad can be doctors, too, man.  Right.  Get a doctor dressed like Caligula.  But he was, his lab coat got stuck on the doorknob, and it was the most awkward thing,  because now I have to help him open the door as he's holding the finger up in the air.  Whoa, one or two.  Because he just raped you.  I know, he always shows two fingers.  Yeah, he's got to show two.  What, did you laugh when he put in one and said, go ahead?  I double dare you. 
[02:44:00]  Double dog dare you.  Two fingers.  He's gone out like John Wayne, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck it.  Fuck it.  40 pounds of food in his colon, I heard, when he died.  40 pounds of food?  Every time I hear that, the number goes up.  It was a tremendous, it was like a butcher shop.  I heard 40 pounds.  I could be wrong.  Food in your colon.  Sure, you can in your whole body, in your intestines.  But the doctor, when I went to the doctor for my physical, I crossed over that demo where  they now have to check your prostate.  I love the ominous tone you guys have as you're describing it. 
[02:44:30]  It's horrid.  Because I wasn't sure.  I was hoping against all hope, but I wasn't sure.  And then I saw his checklist on the side when he left the room, and it's like, okay, we did  that.  Blood, he checks, you know, your glands and stuff like that.  And then I looked, and it was like prostate, and there was a check next to it, like, oh,  he's got to do that.  So, and then I'm just, then no matter what he's doing, you know, his stethoscope, breathe,  breathe.  I'm just thinking, when does he pull this one out? 
[02:45:00]  Is this the showstopper?  Is this the closer?  That's the closer.  You've got to close with that.  How do you follow that?  And you know something?  He closes with that.  He does close with it.  He says, okay, bend over the table.  Take your pants down and bend over the table.  It's like, oh, here it comes.  Here it comes.  Everything you've heard about.  And he puts the little rubber thing on the finger.  Uh, puts it in some lube.  Cold lube.  And then, uh, he goes, okay, just relax.  Relax. 
[02:45:30]  How the hell are you going to relax?  And then, voosh, slides it up there, feels around a little bit.  Did he make it easy for him?  Oh, yeah.  It was whoosh.  Nothing.  He went, oh, surprisingly.  You know what's funny about this shit?  I swear to God, I bet we're like two to three years away from them not having to do that  anymore.  They'll come up with some sort of machine.  So you guys will be part of that generation.  The last ones that had to take it.  You know, like when you hear about operations in the early 1900s, they just gave you a  bottle of whiskey.  There was no anesthetic.  Hacksaws and leeches.  Yeah.  I'm hoping, I'm going to, like, they'll come up with some sort of thing where they can 
[02:46:00]  just...  Keep hoping.  Keep hoping there.  Was he surprised, though, when you not only bent over, but then when you lifted your left  leg and put it up on the table and kept your other foot on the floor?  I kept pushing back when he said he was done.  Yeah.  That's always the moment of the door.  Backwards.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  When we get back, we got Brian Wilson on Imus today.  Yep.  Talking about the Opie and Anthony move.  Not really, Brian.  I'm going to go with a female doctor.  What else?  Oh. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Now that we're doing commercial radio again, we have to do commercials.  Yep.  With our voices.  And we got the first free FM commercial read.  I was a little medicated yesterday, too.  This is us just flubbing.  Oof.  Really, really bad.  A little rusty.  So we'll get into that next as well.  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  You know, the funny thing is, too.  Here comes the world's dumbest jingle.  At least it's a fucking jingle. 
[02:47:00]  I'll show the world I'm a funny guy.  I'll throw in some sound effects and a few lines that don't make no sense and  both of them will be so proud of me.  Thank you.  I missed the point completely.  I should kill myself discreetly.  I got nothing. 
[02:47:30]  That's what I say now.  You can come to the CBS show.  Bill Burns writing bits as the commercials are playing.  Bill Burns studio.  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  The second part of the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah, let's explain that on the air.  It's a great idea.  Not the spin, obviously, but what we want to do. 
[02:48:00]  Yo Mama, the MTV show, is god-awful.  It stinks.  We got some clips, actually.  We can play a few clips from Yo Mama.  There's so many people laughing.  Oh, damn!  Yeah, they're all just...  You know what I like, too, is the perfectly scouted, like, alleys that they have them  in to give them that street cred.  Yeah, they're street look.  It's like the alley from, like, Beat It, you know, when they had that dance night fight.  That show is so horrific, you can't not watch it. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, I know.  I watched the marathon.  It's never funny.  There was a marathon over the weekend, and I watched it.  I couldn't stop.  I couldn't tune away.  Well...  So bad.  Well, why don't we...  All right, we'll play a few clips.  We're like telling knock-knock jokes.  Yeah.  Yo Mama's so fat, she don't have no money.  Oh, damn!  Oh, damn!  And then you gotta run away.  You gotta literally run out of the camera shot.  How about this one?  You did it!  Oh.  You know what's even worse? 
[02:49:00]  I hate how, like, the white kids and the Asian kids, and they all gotta do all that neck rolling.  Yeah.  The black, uh, little gestures.  Yeah.  To make them seem more, like, they have more street cred.  What do the Asian kids do?  Your mama's so fat, they kill second child!  That's what they do in China.  Well, yeah.  You walk up and say, I feel sorry for your mama.  And then the black guy shoots him.  Shows the tape to his friends.  Bill Burr has come up with a really good idea. 
[02:49:30]  But first, though, some clips from Yo Mama on MTV.  Yo, my name is Keith, a.k.a. K Diesel.  I rep the OC.  Yo, what's up?  This is J-Bus.  Rep the OC.  Hey, it's already over, everybody.  I'm about to be the King OC.  What's going on?  This is Will representing the OC.  Hold on.  He's white.  Hold on.  It's Will White.  First of all, when did the OC become cool and hip and a hip place?  What is the OC?  It's not LA.  It's Orange County.  Orange County.  Yes, Orange County.  Orange County is where Disneyland is. 
[02:50:00]  It was Orange Groves.  It's the suburbs of Los Angeles and the far suburb.  Like, you've got to drive to get from Orange County.  This is the funny thing about, like, all that.  Now, every city, like, you know, just like the stupid ones.  You know, Motown, the Big Apple, whatever, Big Easy.  See, now every city, all these kids who send emails.  Yeah.  It's not like, when are you coming to Pittsburgh?  It's when are you coming to the Berg?  The Berg.  Or St. Louis.  The Lou. 
[02:50:30]  The Lou, yeah.  He was in his H-Town.  Really?  It's terrible.  It's horrific.  It's horrific.  San Francisco's the hiv.  Yo, man, when are you coming to the robe?  No, what's hilarious is...  I'm representing the broth.  Hey, we got a black guy on the phone very mad at us.  Bob.  Connecticut, what's up?  Well, yeah, it's just like, I think it's a lot less about what's being black and more 
[02:51:00]  about this generation is all about this is the cool thing to do.  I mean, you guys are cool.  I've been a fan since, like, WNEW.  But you're pretty considerably old dudes compared to what, like, teenagers are acting.  Hip-hop defines the generation right now.  No one is saying that hip-hop isn't really popular.  Yeah, stop hitting us with soundbites.  I've heard all that shit before.  And no one is saying that it's not...  There's no one saying that it's not as huge in culture.  The only annoying thing to me is the way MTV will embrace that culture and forgive, like, 
[02:51:30]  any type of political incorrectness in hip-hop culture.  But if you do something in rock, they panic and they don't want to play your stuff.  I'm not going to question that fact.  It's just that you can't say, well, this is for black people.  And this is for white people because that's what gets the...  Yes, you can.  Yeah, you know.  With everything, including water fountains.  Let me ask you this, sir.  If Irish music all of a sudden became popular and everybody walked around speaking in a brogue,  would you find that a little odd?  No, man.  I'm a big fan of Flogging Molly.  It's a great Irish band.  Hey, dude. 
[02:52:00]  So do you speak in a brogue?  Aye.  You know, I know what you're talking about.  You see people that we used to call wiggers.  Still do, by the way.  Well, that offends me because that's just the point where it's clownish, like it's step  and fetch it.  No, no.  I'm not talking about that type of stuff.  I'm talking about, you know, there are certain head gestures, hand gestures, walking that  is black.  And when white people do it, it just looks silly.  It's not taking...  It looks silly when black people do it.  That's true.  Well, the thing is, like... 
[02:52:30]  My whole family is black, believe it or not.  And most of them don't do the...  That's not how it works, doesn't it?  It sounds like, though, what you're saying then.  How about when...  My family's half white.  I don't know how it happens, but...  How about when a comic gets up, a black comic, and does that stereotypical white guy,  hey, I'm going to mow the lawn now and do that whole thing?  That ends up being hacky.  That's hacky.  Just the same thing as a white guy goes, well, black people talk like this, man.  Well, yeah, but that isn't what we were doing, so what was your issue with us? 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, have you seen the show?  I don't understand.  Yeah, it's a lot less about it's being black and being white, more about it's just stupid.  It's a stupid culture.  This generation is dumb.  Yeah, but the hip-hop culture, dude, is...  I mean, look, Eminem is huge.  There were some other ones, but it's predominantly black art.  Hip-hop and the whole culture around hip-hop is black.  It's the what?  It's not bad that it's black, but it is what it is.  And Bill raised a great point about the Irish thing. 
[02:53:30]  That's more of a thing for Irish culture.  It doesn't mean it's wrong.  Yeah, there's a level of phoniness going on.  I'm not saying you can't enjoy the music, but at some point, you can still be like yourself.  Well, I can agree with you.  A lot of it's just rebelling against your parents because you don't want to fit in.  This guy hits us with one more hacky soundbite.  Yes.  All right, Bob.  And you're a black guy named Bob from Connecticut.  I don't buy it.  Yeah.  Well, I am.  I'll see you guys later. 
[02:54:00]  Bob, we were just trying to have fun, though.  Yeah.  B to the O to the B.  All right, back to the Yo Mama.  You'll be the King O.C.  What's going on?  This is Will, representing the O.C.  Today, I'm going to take these little fake gangsters and rip them up and have them going  back to the suburbs where they belong.  Yeah, y'all.  It's the one and only Mo Show.  You can't have a show without Mo.  O.C., look out.  This DMACC coming through with the freshest, newest snaps.  Hey, y'all.  I'm Tree Sound representing O.C.  Let's do this.  One of these things. 
[02:54:30]  She didn't quite sound like she fit.  Well, here's the first battle.  All right, get ready.  Let's do this.  The Yo Mama battle.  I'm going to bring the ruckus.  Y'all ready?  Let's battle.  Yo, check you out, blondie.  What's up?  You got beautiful blonde hair, but why'd you dye the roots black?  Some people get their blonde hair from their mother's side.  But where'd you get your blonde hair?  From the peroxide?  In the same place you got that joke, the internet. 
[02:55:00]  Say you can't even snap up your shoes.  Can't even snap up my shoes?  Is that the best you got?  Your mom's so stupid, she had to put lipstick on her head to make up her mind.  Yo, PeeBee Longstocking.  The only reason you're on this show is affirmative action.  Man, your crop looks like 10 miles of bad road.  And that looks like 10 miles of bad joke.  Yo, why y'all got me standing next to a black leprechaun?  This dude so short...  This dude so short, he can slam dunk his bus fare. 
[02:55:30]  Now I know you ain't talking with your mama puberty hair on your head.  I know you ain't talking.  Look at you, man.  You so short, you had to stand on a chair just to reach puberty.  Yo, Chubby, all I want to know one thing is...  Got milk?  Oh.  I know you're not talking with that big ass forehead.  Look at you, you got two faces on there, but you do have a long face and your teeth look  like chiclets.  It hurts.  He's saying you ugly, dog.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah, I'll tell you what.  If you can make me laugh, I'll buy you a training bra. 
[02:56:00]  Now he got an I love hip hop.  I bet your girl got one at the I love hippo.  The only good thing about that was the white girl bombing as horribly as she should have.  Yeah.  The only thing you could snap up is your shoes.  You know what that should be followed with?  The only thing that's funny on that show is when somebody bombs and people trash how  bad the joke is.  Right.  But it's never...  Well, we don't need to hear any more.  No, no.  No, I think we've given a good example. 
[02:56:30]  This is what Phil Burr has come up with.  We do our own Yo Mama contest featuring Twitchels.  Big A.  Big A, of course.  Stalker Patty, who's outside the studio.  No Filter Paul.  All the regulars.  Does Bam want in?  Maybe Bam wants to do Yo Mama.  What do you think?  Schizo Bill.  Schizo Bill.  We could start with Twitchels and Big A doing Yo Mama.  That could be really funny. 
[02:57:00]  Bill just doing them alone.  Right.  Schizo Bill doing them just alone.  Representing the mental ward.  Yeah, we'll set that up and hopefully we can do it this week.  Yeah.  We should do it this week.  Maybe Friday.  We'll have Ben.  Did Ben make it back yet?  Over there.  Ben's back.  Or over here.  From the other place?  You want to do it over there?  I say we do that one over there.  It's safe. 
[02:57:30]  Over there.  No, because we got to introduce the new audience to Big A and Twitchels.  We could do it over there and then we could do it over here.  Maybe do it in both places.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  The too hot for TV.  Too hot for free.  Yes.  Too hot.  Look at you.  Might have to pay you.  I'm on the payroll.  He's coming up with stuff on the fly here.  You ever produce a show before?  I know, right?  I get one of those $25 XM checks every nine months. 
[02:58:00]  I know.  Matt in Minnesota.  What's up?  Hello?  Let's go, Matt.  Hello?  Hey, I just wanted to give Jimmy credit.  Nobody gave him credit.  I have a cold as well as Anthony, but I call it crap.  I just want to give Jimmy credit on colored something with the fountains.  He had made a comment and nobody picked it up.  Oh, with the water fountains?  Thank you.  That did deserve a little more than it got, which was complete indifference.  All right.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah.  All right.  We got some audio from Imus today. 
[02:58:30]  They've been all over our story today, which is great.  Yeah, I have the tissues.  Are you?  Those are my tender sentiments, Keith.  Give me the toilet paper.  No, immediately.  What the heck's going on over there?  Come on, you fuck.  You're in no position to yell at anyone.  That's right.  Like running.  The New York Post stinks.  Why, what's up?  Just awful.  It's a real slow day for the newspapers.  That front section is a lot of quality in there. 
[02:59:00]  If you want to know what's going on in the world, you've got to reach for the New York  Post.  Right.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I mean, check out some of the stories on the first five pages.  Anthony's getting a phone call.  Hello?  Shh, shh, shh.  Anthony's getting a phone call.  Hello?  Hello?  Who is it?  I'm hearing, just talking in the background, someone named Master Poe has inadvertently  auto-dialed my phone during the show.  Let's hear what he says. 
[02:59:30]  So I'm hearing talking.  Let's hear what he says.  It's his background noise.  Did you see his Tom Cruise shades he had on?  Yeah.  He looks ridiculous.  Jesus.  He's got his Pulp Fiction suit on with the Tom Cruise glasses.  Those, like, fucking, those knicker pants don't quite reach his ankles.  He looks like Tough No. 4 in some bad 80s action.  Can I be put on some kind of auto-dial that just can't be hit ever?  You can't find him?  No, he went to get a smoothie or something, so it's somewhere out in the street. 
[03:00:00]  He's ordering smoothies.  Can you hear anything that's going on?  I don't know.  Let's see.  All right.  I'm going to turn the volume up.  He might be around.  Right downstairs.  I'll run out.  Can you hear this?  Hold on.  Crank that up.  Is there a speaker?  Yeah, why don't you get the speaker going?  Put the speaker on.  I love you.  Speaker on.  All right. 
[03:00:30]  He's trying to pick up chicks.  He's still listening, sir.  All right.  Please, the sound of screeching tires and a scream. 
[03:01:00]  What was he?  Getting in a car for Auschwitz?  Wait.  Tell him to talk.  Someone's telling him.  Hello?  Hello?  Say it again. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, he realized.  Instead of coming on the air, he just hangs up.  Hang up.  Way to have no climax.  Yeah, thanks for giving the bit.  Gentlemen, thanks for giving the bit no ending.  I'm sorry, gentlemen.  I hit the button.  Inadvertently called you.  Is my mic still loud?  Gentlemen.  Steve's lost a ton of weight, huh?  Yes.  It still looks stupid.  It's like a beefed up Dane Cook.  A little tank top he had on there?  He does have the Dane Cook thing going on.  Did you ever notice when a dinosaur roars?  I don't like to play menoppy because every game ends with fuck it. 
[03:02:00]  He's filming an HOMO special.  Steve.  He was in the round.  I filmed it.  All right.  Listen, we got some Imus audio from earlier today.  All right.  They've been all over our news, which is really, really cool of Mr. Imus and the gang.  And Brian Wilson, played by our good friend.  Rob Bartlett.  Of course.  Rob.  Was doing the Brian Wilson today, and this is how it went down. 
[03:02:30]  Please welcome on the program, Brian Wilson.  Good morning, Brian.  Well, BF.  To be thrown off the public airwaves on account you had sex with St. Patrick,  today you're making your triumphant return to free radio.  I never thought you should have been fired in the first place because who you have sex  with in the privacy of your own home is your own business.  And after all, it was St. Patrick, so you were both probably drunk anyway.  But the best part is you're replacing your old nemesis, Howard Stern, who's not all that 
[03:03:00]  happy because making the move to satellite radio didn't work out all that great for him.  He went from being the king of all media to, like, the radio version of Betamax.  But as bad as Howard feels, I know somebody who feels a whole lot worse, Mel Karmazan.  Because, like, he ponied up some serious money to get Howard on serious satellite radio.  Five hundred million dollars.  And I bet now Mel's thinking, wow, five hundred million dollars? 
[03:03:30]  I could have saved a hundred million and just thrown four hundred million down a sewer.  But it's good to get you back on free radio, Opie.  And it should be a pretty easy gig because you're, like, replacing the replacement  who didn't do a very good job.  Well, to be honest, you could have put a monkey in that chair and he would have done a better job.  Especially if it was Nicky Dolan's.  But no, they thought David Lee Roth was a good idea. 
[03:04:00]  Even I knew that one wasn't going to work.  I mean, how much bubbly-see-bly-doo-ba-dee-dibble-dee-bop could anybody listen to?  Not much.  His ratings were so low, not even the guys at the board in his control room were listening.  I don't know why Diamond Dave had such a difficult time to replace a Howard.  How hard could it be to find some $20 hooker to get naked and spank each other?  I bet David Lee feels almost as bad as Mel Karmazin. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, the only way he could feel worse than Mel would be if they replaced him with Sammy Hagar  instead of you and Anthony.  But that's showbiz.  You go from being David Lee Roth, the guy from Van Halen, to Diamond Dave from MTV,  to being fired from your job as the Pete Best of Free FM,  to being David Lee Roth all over again.  From David Lee Roth, Toyota.  I can see the commercial now.  I lost my gig and so, I got nowhere to go. 
[03:05:00]  So people, here's the cars I'm selling.  Bubbly-dee-bbly-subbly-bop.  I'm Brian Wilson.  How are you?  I'm fine.  I ain't got nobody or a career.  Jesus.  Poor Dave.  He didn't hurt anybody, did he?  Still one of the great front men of all time.  Of course.  Karate expert. 
[03:05:30]  Rock star.  Hey, we got to get No Filter Paul in here and bam.  They got a present for you, Anthony.  What?  Let's bring in No Filter Paul and bam.  Unless it's a new throat.  Jesus.  Do you want some throat coat?  No.  Well, you got to give them some props.  They organized the whole thing outside the other studio.  Throat coat tea.  Yes?  Is very...  I have some throat yogurt for you.  But throat coat is a tea.  Poor cake. 
[03:06:00]  Called, uh...  Then stalker pad it.  Come on in.  What the hell?  They're you.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Thanks for showing up today.  Anytime.  Anytime.  Yes, boys.  That mic sounds awful, Iraq.  And you would know that if you had headphones on.  That's right, Iraq.  We tell you time and time again, put headphones on.  What do you do?  Nothing.  Nothing.  That's okay.  I'll share with Paul.  Lovely.  All right.  Iraq's got a nice racing stripe down both sleeves.  I don't know if anybody noticed that.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  He does.  Looks like a man who hit the lottery to me.  So what do you guys got today?  You guys got all over the news this morning.  Yeah, we heard.  There was tons of reporters there.  Yeah.  First time we were in front of a camera.  Wait, who was outside there?  Because we had to make the walk.  There was a lot of photographers.  There was a few video crews, right?  There was Daily News.  Ron?  Channel 11.  Channel 11 were there.  Yeah.  WB was there.  Another television was in church when that was. 
[03:07:00]  And then there was a bunch of like the AP photographers there.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And cool.  Yeah.  The wire stuff.  And you brought a present for Anthony on his fine birthday.  I'm sick and I'm cranky.  We brought a birthday cake.  Yeah?  For a birthday cake.  You guys should put out like an O&A fan fitness tape.  Yeah.  What are you saying there, Bill?  I'm just saying.  You know, Jimmy and I...  Maybe it's just the ones who come down to the studio.  Jimmy and I were talking about this.  We went to see Dane Cook at the...  What are they calling it now in Boston? 
[03:07:30]  The Garden?  Yeah.  It's back to the garden, sort of.  The Enormo Dome.  And he was doing his HBO special.  They were doing the whole taping, right?  And Jimmy and I were looking around like, what is different between his fans and our fans?  I want to fuck his fans.  From row A to row quadruple B.  It's amazing.  It looks like they have no problem staying on the Fat Smash Diet.  They really don't.  They're all young and full of life.  Full of energy and fun. 
[03:08:00]  And our fans are one cigarette away from a massive heart attack.  Yeah.  Look at these guys.  Less than that.  Less than that.  That's a great...  Oh!  Oh!  It's a birthday cake.  Why don't we get some pictures of the birthday cake for the website?  Oh, that is very funny.  It says...  It's a visual, people.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  It says, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, boys.  Because everyone knows...  It's my birthday. 
[03:08:30]  And they tried to steal my thunder, but...  That's very nice.  Very funny.  It's always Jimmy's birthday.  All right, we'll be cutting that up.  Why don't we open up the lid?  That would be really nice.  I really shouldn't, but you know...  You should.  You know what?  Because it has nice pink frosting.  Good point, Bill.  Good point.  Jimmy, this is going to be your third dessert of the morning.  I can't have it all, but you shouldn't.  A little piece only.  Pass it around.  I'm telling you.  Pass it around.  Let everybody see it.  Steve.  Steve is stealing Dane Cook's look.  I'm not.  But you are.  You look like his head shot.  No, I don't.  Yes. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, someone should do that Photoshop.  I like how you just went with total denial.  No, I'm not.  I've never seen his head shot.  Steve, how did it go over the other place there?  What do you think?  It's kind of crazy, but we'll get into it.  Yeah, I thought we did pretty good.  Yeah, we did fine.  All right.  Also, Storker Patty, why don't you step up to that microphone?  You got something for Anthony as well?  Oops.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Patty.  I know you're going to have a very early commute in the morning, so I brought something to help  you along.  You know what's going to be like a flourless chocolate cake?  That's something awful. 
[03:09:30]  Patty, Keith pointed out something.  Your dumper looks good in those pants.  Yeah.  With your little Janis Joplin.  Yeah.  Your dumper looks really good.  My dumper?  Yeah.  What's my dumper?  Your turd cutter.  Your coffee, espresso beans, and a Starbucks coffee cup.  Very good.  I know you're going to want coffee for your early morning commute.  Of course I am, Patty.  Get the knife.  You're welcome.  So much.  Very practical gift.  Oh, it's so practical.  Thank you. 
[03:10:00]  I just didn't know that her mitts were around that.  Why don't we have Patty cut the cake for everybody?  Patty, cut the cake.  Why don't we get a knife for Patty?  Why not?  I completely agree.  Why don't we have Psycho Bill Shoverface in it?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  No.  No, we wouldn't do that.  That was worse.  That was terrible.  Once again, you are an idiot, Bill.  Once again.  Hey, um.  And you wonder why that phone's not ringing. 
[03:10:30]  You know, why are you coming in at night?  I really am the fucking worst.  You are the bit ruiner.  I am the fucking...  We've discussed this in the past.  You're going to cut the cake with this?  Just cut it.  All right.  Well, it'll have the same effect.  Do you watch?  It will.  I'm watching.  I want a piece, Patty.  I'm not going to do anything.  Patty, I want a corner.  I'm scared.  Oh, you stop being scared.  The E.T. body cuts the cake. 
[03:11:00]  You cut the cake?  Let me have a corner.  Patty, cut me a corner.  Ooh, corner for Jimmy.  Give me a corner.  Jimmy, how many desserts?  All right, okay.  I really shouldn't.  Jimmy.  Oh, this cake.  Oh, no.  No, don't be.  I'm dressed for work.  I can't.  It's a good time to get her.  Don't worry.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait.  No, no, no.  Wait, no.  Oh, no.  I'm dressed for work. 
[03:11:30]  She's dressed for work.  Don't come hear me.  I have to go to work after this, okay?  At 12.30.  Yeah, 12.30.  12.30.  12.30.  12.30.  Yes, I do.  What time do you work?  12.30.  I think the listeners could raise money for new clothes.  No.  Here's the deal.  No.  You're 10 feet from the door.  When I say go, we'll give you a chance.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Someone say go.  You get three seconds to run to the door. 
[03:12:00]  Bam, open the door.  No.  Ready?  No.  Set.  Go.  Set.  1,000.  You're getting in three seconds, Bam will open the door.  No.  And then you'll start to run.  I can't.  Why can't you?  No, because I'm dressed for work.  Shut up.  I don't have time to go home and change.  That cake is like 50 pounds.  I love you, oldie.  I have to knock her over.  All right.  I can't do it.  No.  All right.  Why don't you leave the street?  Mike, I'm shaking here.  I know.  I'll just put the cake down over here.  It's okay.  Yeah, put it down over there. 
[03:12:30]  Why don't you take the knife out of it, psychopath?  No, leave then.  Come on, Patty.  She's not leaving.  Oh, she's picking her back up.  Patty, he just ran.  No.  Just have the door open a little bit.  How about like one piece?  No.  You're no fun anymore.  That's right.  She's clinging to people so she doesn't get hit. 
[03:13:00]  All right, Patty.  I'm like shaking.  He's far enough away from it now.  He can never make it there before.  Get rid of that cheap cake.  We don't want to eat that anyway.  Nice four-dollar cake, you jizzbuckets.  All right.  Go, Patty.  Leave.  Cheat cake.  It's a shit cake.  Leave before we're tempted.  Trust me.  Just leave before we're tempted.  Yeah, get rid of that cake there, you rock.  Patty, quick.  Run.  Run.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:13:30]  Wait a minute.  Oh, no.  That isn't right.  I have to go to work.  Oh, no.  Patty, don't cry.  Patty, don't cry.  Yeah, but you serve food at work.  Maybe they'll think you're just working hard.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  You came in as a nice birthday.  Don't cry and make us all really pleased.  No crying.  Oh, we relax.  Can you get a mic on her?  Because she's crying.  This is the worst.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:00]  She's crying.  You know who should cry?  Fucking E-Rock for his aim.  It had to bounce off the wall, you fucking girl arm.  Oh, wait.  E-Rock is very, very pissed off.  What's up, E-Rock?  Tell me.  Tell us.  This douchebag right here.  Oh, shit.  What happened?  We had it all set up, ready to go.  He's going, you should do it.  You should do it.  Right in front of her, and then I go to do it, and he blocks my arm.  Yeah, bit ruiner.  Asshole.  Is it on video that, uh, no filter, Paul?  I was right.  Blocking the shot.  I'm sorry. 
[03:14:30]  Patty.  I've got to get this off me before I go to work.  Oh, my God.  How are you going to get that off your pants?  Oh, no.  It's just on my pants, and I wear an apron.  Yeah, it's all behind you.  Wait, wait.  Turn around, though, Patty.  Turn around.  Let's see.  Let me see.  Patty.  Yeah, there's nothing on your back.  Oh, dude.  That's fine.  You know what?  You're fine.  Patty has a nice ass.  Patty, turn around.  You're fine.  Turn around, Patty.  Thank God there's nothing on your back.  No, you're fine.  You're fine.  Take her to the bathroom.  I'm okay.  No.  And shoot her.  I just need a tissue to wipe my pants off.  That's all you need. 
[03:15:00]  You're fine.  Why would you throw a cake at me?  I don't know.  I know.  I don't understand.  Where's my glasses, by the way?  Hey, let me know, by the way.  I did not throw the cake at Stark and Pat.  Where's my glasses, by the way?  I need them.  Can I, uh...  You broke them.  No, let me...  Am I actually...  Let me clean off her glasses for her.  Oh, please.  I don't...  I can't afford...  I can't see, and I can't afford another...  I can't see, gotcha.  Please don't.  I don't have money for another pair of glasses.  Please.  Don't do...  Please.  Break the glasses. 
[03:15:30]  I don't have money for another pair of glasses.  No, you can't break her glasses.  Please.  No, she has to work.  It's prescription glasses.  I can't see without them.  I'm legally blind.  It sounds like a bad play.  Oh, God.  This is horrible.  What's wrong?  Jimmy.  I can't...  Please don't break her glasses.  Can I please have my glasses back?  I hate her, but you can't break her glasses.  She has to see.  Please.  Can I have my glasses back?  I can't see.  Her awful life. 
[03:16:00]  That is true.  What are you going to do?  Look at your bank account and get a clear...  I can't leave without my glasses, Sophie, please.  Stop stepping on me.  I need them.  I have to see the register at work.  Let me wipe off your back.  Yeah.  Wipe off your back.  No.  Something she'll never hear again.  No, you don't wipe the back off.  You leave it on the back.  What's wrong with people?  Good one, Daddy.  You don't wipe it off.  These glasses don't look like their prescription, though, Patty.  They are. 
[03:16:30]  Are you sure?  Yes.  Hmm.  That looks good, Patty.  No one will notice.  Actually, those are the glasses Maury Povic gave me.  Maury who?  Did he diddle you?  Because it seems like he's diddling everyone else over there.  Yeah, it's a little sexual up problem.  Did you see anything crazy over there when you taped the Maury Povic show?  No.  He has his own TV show.  He should be fucking someone on the side.  What's his name, Patty?  Yeah.  Who?  Can I please have my glasses?  Patty, who did you say?  Maury who?  I didn't hear you.  Yeah.  Maury Povic. 
[03:17:00]  Maury Povic.  Oh, thank God I wear an apron.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  If you break the Moby, you're going to get me another pair of glasses so I can see.  Oh, don't do it.  Oh, no.  Don't do it.  There's no way, you know.  Oh, no.  I think even this show has a line.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Why is he lowering the microphone to the floor?  I can't see without my glasses. 
[03:17:30]  Is Opie going to lay on the floor and broadcast?  Oh, no.  I have 2350 vision.  Shut up, would you?  Jesus Christ.  We get it.  You're blind.  Opie.  Opie, if you do this, where can you go from here?  Please don't pull out my IV.  If he does that, he's buying me another pair of glasses and a eye exam.  Please don't throw Arthur Ashe's blood in my face.  Well, what are you going to do today?  How are you going to work?  You're going to get fired. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  How are you going to get home?  Um, well, I happen to be nearsighted.  Which means you can't see how far away?  I can't see far away, no.  Hey, does anyone have a hammer?  I don't think we have any hammers or mallets.  No.  Patty, one of your toes.  Don't do it.  All I know is I won't be able to read.  Well, what do you have to read besides a checkbook with a zero in it and eviction notice? 
[03:18:30]  Well, don't do it.  Oh.  You can't believe how happy and positive I was feeling a month away from this show, right?  Yeah.  Why'd you take your shoe off, Hulk?  Do you have an itch?  All right, Khrushchev.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Patty.  Now, he's going to get me another pair of glasses. 
[03:19:00]  He got you that pair.  Oh, yes, he will.  Oh, yes, he will.  He will get me another pair of glasses.  Oh.  I think they can be fixed.  Oh, this is just not dry.  This is cruel and unusual.  You know, I think if you just put a piece of tape in the middle of them.  No.  Well, he's going to get me another, a brand new pair of glasses.  That's what he's going to do. 
[03:19:30]  Stop trying to hold on to your dignity by being assertive.  He's going to get me glasses.  What are you telling?  You're talking to the window, you nearsighted idiot.  Yeah, could you see him do it?  Not really.  Exactly.  She's looking at Bill Burr's elbow.  You're going to get me glasses.  No, I'm going to get me a slurry far away.  Well?  All right.  Well, thanks for giving Anthony a birthday gift.  Thank you, Patty.  Patty, do you need a tender sentiment? 
[03:20:00]  Oh.  No, I need another pair of glasses.  Jimmy, pull out a tender sentiment for Patty.  Patty, this will help.  And make her read it.  Yeah, make her read it.  Read what?  Shut your mouth.  A tender sentiment.  Just a tender.  When I get sad, I need a tender sentiment.  Reach into this and pull out a tender sentiment and read it.  She put a mouse trap to have glasses.  It would have been perfect.  What's it say?  You are special. 
[03:20:30]  Now put that back.  Here we go.  That's for sure.  Kind of makes you forget all about the glasses, doesn't it?  Exactly.  Oh, I'm not going to forget them, no.  Way to be literal with humor.  Here's a piece of the eyeglass.  You could look through that little chip of glass.  See, you can get a pair of glasses just like that.  I can't.  Well, that's the beauty of this bitch.  I thought your stylist got those for a new look.  I had a good line that no one...  I cannot afford a couple hundred dollars for a new pair of glasses and a prescription. 
[03:21:00]  All right, well, got to move on with the show.  And you're going to give me a new pair of glasses because I need glasses to see them.  If you say the word glasses again, I'm going to fucking tape them up and step on them over.  Stop.  Ah, all the time in the world.  All right, well, let you...  That's my light zone?  Well, let her go.  Let her try to find her way out of the studio. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, go ahead, Patty.  All right.  All right, Patty.  Thank you for coming in.  Thank you.  Magoo, you've done it again.  All right.  Thank you, stalker Patty.  Oh, my God.  Someone's got to take care of that.  Oh, but she just keeps coming back.  Can somebody take her to H&M and get her a new black shirt?  Yeah.  Please.  Yeah.  Like a battered wife.  She just keeps...  Nice glasses, though.  Well, I don't want these people killing me, so... 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Give those back to the poor thing.  He's going to get me...  We get it.  No, we know.  She really is like Dr. Melfi when she talks.  Let's go to John in Kentucky.  John?  Why did you break that woman's glasses?  Because it's funny, stupid.  Now she walks out in front of the street, she's going to hit by a bus.  I'll give you stuff for her to laugh for tomorrow.  Be news.  Mm-hmm.  Be able to talk about it.  All right, boy, you're doing a good job. 
[03:22:30]  Glad you're back.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  All right.  Oh, she's all upset.  Wait, let's bring Patty back.  And she's really upset.  But I need glasses to see what...  I don't wear them for show.  This is a microphone outside the studio.  No, you can talk to her out there.  Oh, Patty.  Sorry.  Yeah, we got to move on with the show, Patty.  I'm sorry.  Take care, Patty.  Be good.  All right.  Radio gold as always, baby.  Take care.  Really?  I'm just upset about the glasses. 
[03:23:00]  Well, I mean...  Cake is nothing.  You can clean cake off, but I can't replace those glasses.  I don't have the money to.  But don't you work at a nice place now where you can just buy some new glasses?  I work with Starbucks, but I only make $8.75 an hour, and I have no insurance.  So how could I afford another pair of glasses?  It's going to cost at least a couple hundred dollars.  So that's only like a couple of months' worth of paycheck.  That's not so bad.  I can't go without eyeglasses that long. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, what about the people making minimum wage?  What are they going to do?  Well, they have other kinds of help.  I forget.  What's the matter, Patty?  No.  It's a lot.  No.  Oh, she's getting upset again.  No.  I'm not going to say anything.  She's no commenting.  I've never seen her like this.  She's getting all 60 minutes on.  Yeah, I know.  Someone better hand her her glasses.  I had three pieces of cake. 
[03:24:00]  Give her her glasses.  Where is she?  She's right outside the door.  She's outside.  Well, your mic's not on.  Hello?  She's crying outside.  She's crying.  I'll let it happen.  Yeah, well, yeah, let's get some more audio of her crying, and then we'll...  Come on.  We'll do, boss.  And then, E-Rock, you do what's right.  So, Eric, you were pretty hot under the collar with no filter, Paul. 
[03:24:30]  Wait, wait.  You are worse than everybody.  There's some right there.  There's some right there, man.  Can you wipe that green goo?  There's a little green goo on the back because I leaned into a wall.  Yeah, that'll happen.  I'll make the next Drew Boogie remix.  I don't know what that is.  So, what are you going to do about your glasses, Patty?  I can't do anything about them. 
[03:25:00]  I don't know what to do.  I don't have money for glasses.  You really should replace them.  I think I have a 10 spot I could lend you.  See if she still likes me.  I think I have, like, 10 bars.  E-Rock, see if she still likes me.  No, I'm not going to be able to replace those glasses.  No, they're replaceable.  Do you still like Opie?  Like Ben Franklin's glasses in a museum.  Yeah, I love everybody.  I could take a joke and everything, but the glasses, well, I should know he's a nut anyway.  So you're okay with this?  I mean, I'm okay, but what am I going to do about my glasses? 
[03:25:30]  I can't replace them.  That's a hardship.  Hardship?  That's not a hardship.  You should be thrown overboard, the hardship.  E-Rock, walk out with them on your head.  Yeah, don't bend them.  Well, that's a thought.  Interview her like that.  Yeah, interview her like that.  You all right, Patty?  Feeling all right?  Yeah, I'm okay.  Yeah, I'm fine.  You're going to be able to go to work? 
[03:26:00]  I can work, but I'm not going to be able to see far away or recognize people from far away.  Yeah, I can still make coffee, right?  I-Rock is interviewing Dr. Patty with her glasses that were not broken.  I need glasses like a 2,400 fashion.  Are you still crying?  Look at me.  Are you still crying?  Look at me.  Oh, I'm all right.  Are you okay?  Yeah.  I'm fine.  Not even noticing his glasses, looking right at them.  I say if she doesn't notice, you really break them.  Do I have green goo on my back?  Do I have goo on my back? 
[03:26:30]  I don't know.  I can't release it.  You look fine.  Yeah, I just got to...  I need some water.  I got to go into the bathroom and get water.  You're going to have to lean in to give her a kiss before she's going to notice.  Please.  E-Rock is inches away from her face with the glasses on.  I just want to make sure you're okay.  Look into my eyes.  He even said look into my eyes.  I'm fine.  You're okay?  Yeah, I'm okay.  Okay.  Oh, she should be beaten.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, she's just so beaten that she's not even noticing.  What happened, E-Rock?  A psychologist would say she's in shock right now. 
[03:27:00]  She didn't even know.  She's about three inches from my face.  I had no idea that we still had a glasses.  What is wrong with her?  All right.  Just give her the glasses back.  Give her the goddamn glasses back.  We're live on the air, obviously, so we can hear the joy in her voice.  Yes.  It won't be joy, though.  It'll be, oh, there they are.  Oh, good.  Now I can see.  All right.  We're listening to E-Rock.  Coming outside. 
[03:27:30]  Some squeaky doors.  I don't know where they are.  I just can't believe I said that again.  I fucked up another one, man.  Yeah, we were obviously going to try to do something with the cake.  Her face was going to go right in the cake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all right, though.  Well, what's going on?  Bill suggested opening a window and dropping the glasses out and making her catch them.  So if she catches them, it's okay.  Bill comes up with some pretty twisted stuff.  Where's E-Rock? 
[03:28:00]  Is he waiting for her?  She might kill herself in the bathroom.  That wouldn't.  Yeah.  He's waiting outside with the glasses.  All right.  Look at that car.  You going to get one of those, Anthony?  No.  A lithium?  Lithium car.  What the hell is that?  I like iron around me.  Big vehicles.  What's going on, Danny?  It's not like a man with a gun collection.  She's in the bathroom, so E-Rock's waiting for her to finish up.  Just walk in.  Go in there.  Broad's on this floor.  Pull your cock out and walk in that room.  Yeah, I think she has the only key, though. 
[03:28:30]  There's only this one lady's room key.  Put the glasses on your ball bag.  You watch what a non-reaction this fucking dunce gives.  Oh, I thought he broke them.  I guess he was playing a trick on me.  Yes, I guess he was.  Stupid.  I am relieved.  Because I wouldn't...  And then she'll go on to say what would have happened.  Like, I would have had to get this...  And I can't afford.  What do we got, Danny?  We're just waiting?  We have to.  Yeah. 
[03:29:00]  There's no girl that can drag her out of there?  Is she weeping or dropping a deuce?  Oh, no.  It's probably both at the same time.  Nothing better than a good cry in a shit.  The green...  You can do those simultaneously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Feels good.  Hey, uh...  But E-Rock, he decided he wanted to throw the cake.  Yeah.  And then he is really pissed off at you.  What did you do, Paul?  Besides, obviously, like, laugh and go,  Hey, do it now. 
[03:29:30]  I don't like your Charles Bronson haircut.  That's exactly what it looks like.  Death Wish 2.  Oh, dude, I was trying to figure out that stupid haircut for three years.  It's Bronson.  What do you use this for?  Jacking off?  It's my car.  Hey, do we have mousetraps around?  What do you want to do right now?  Put the glasses in a mousetrap?  No, put the glasses on the floor with a few mousetraps. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, can we get E-Rock before he gives the glasses back?  You should have had the mousetraps.  Hey, Nathaniel, do we still have mousetraps?  Too cruel.  All right.  Yeah, they're right up there by the wiffle ball up there.  All right.  Did you give them back yet?  No, there's other people going out of the ladies' room.  I can't go out of there.  Not enough.  Did she count you?  All right.  Dude, this would be crazy if she kills herself  as you're waiting outside with her glasses.  You like Paula Abdul songs, you can use the ladies' room.  Nothing?  No, but you know what? 
[03:30:30]  I'm more than willing to crash myself.  No, but I don't think it deserved to crash.  I think it was pretty funny.  You were calling him a faggot,  and it was trying to process it first.  Patty.  Patty.  Come here.  You all right?  You all cleaned up?  You should show them first to her.  Yeah.  Patty.  Stop crying?  Patty.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Patty, come in here.  Patty.  Watch this non-reaction.  Patty.  Oh, my God.  How are you?  She looks like someone in need of a rape kit.  No, she doesn't.  I'm fine.  You're fine?  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  We have good news for you.  What?  E-Rock has your glasses.  No, no, don't give it to her.  She let go of them.  I thought you broke them.  I know.  Oh, my God.  Through the magic of radio, I didn't break the glass.  What do you think of the fact that your glasses aren't broken?  It's a relief.  I can't afford to replace them.  Just not an ounce of pizzazz.  You know what it is, Jim?  She acts with her eyes.  If you really look at them, you see the excitement. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, they open up.  How many mousetraps do we have?  Oh, God.  And you can't see.  Not that again.  And you can't see.  Well, we're going to play a little game.  We're going to have the glasses on the floor.  Wait a minute.  We're going to play.  They're going to have more mousetraps again?  We're going to play.  Pick up the.  Most annoying voice ever.  I didn't like the way they flew.  We're going to play pick up the.  That sounds like comedy writing from, like, Webster.  Wait a minute.  How many mousetraps do we have?  Why, you. 
[03:32:00]  Hey, Patty, it's a little game called pick up the glasses with your click.  Oh, God.  It's nice, actually.  The way they flew up.  It's ridiculous, isn't it, Jim?  Can I touch your hiney, Patty?  That's all I remember is them flying.  Patty, can I touch your bottom?  Can I give it a pat?  I'll be nice.  Oh, come on.  A little one.  No, it actually looks great in those pants.  Everyone says you have a nice ass.  Turn.  I'm going to touch it.  I'm just looking.  Show Jimmy your ass.  Her ass might be fine, but from the front, she looks like she's wearing state trooper pants. 
[03:32:30]  Those are.  You look great in those pants.  Like she's got motorcycle cop pants on.  Can I pat it real quick?  Please?  Yeah, let Jimmy pat.  I'll be a gentleman.  She has a booty.  Yeah.  She's just acquired that recently.  Let me see.  I won't do it unless you tell me I can.  All right.  One little.  Wait, wait.  Let him touch your ass.  That was your one chance.  Why'd you move so fast?  Why'd you move so fast?  You didn't get a real touch.  I wasn't going to be rude.  Yeah.  I asked. 
[03:33:00]  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, turn around.  I'll be nice.  I promise.  Come on.  Let Jimmy touch your butt.  There's nothing sexual about a pat.  I'll be nice.  Jimmy just adjusted himself.  All right.  Why don't run away so much?  I saw you.  You saw what?  I saw what he was doing.  What was he doing?  He was a little pat.  Trying to join a lacrosse team.  Lacrosse.  That's right.  Uh-huh.  What was I doing?  I saw you.  What? 
[03:33:30]  He was touching yourself.  All right.  Do we have mouse traps?  How many we got?  Pitiful amount.  Three.  We can send somebody.  We have three.  All right, Patty.  I'm in front of her.  Get on all fours.  We're going to play a little game called find the glasses.  Yeah, you can stay closed this time, please.  Yeah.  That's fair.  But one of the mouse traps will have the glasses in them.  So you've got to be very, very careful. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Sorry.  Jimmy just dove in for another.  What a feel.  Patty's cheeks are looking great.  Are you digging her ass?  Holy shit, am I?  I just want to rub my mule on it and then fucking just go ahead.  No.  Patty, can I rub my cock on your bare ass?  Patty, how much ass did you throw?  Okay, yeah.  There's the option.  Jimmy's cock on her bare ass or mouse traps.  Yes.  Deal.  What do you want?  Or no deal.  I won't have a hard on, believe me.  What do you want to get your glasses back? 
[03:34:30]  Right.  But I won't push it in.  I promise you.  I will never do that.  All right.  I'll try to avoid the mouse traps.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Jimmy's dick on your bare ass.  This reminds me.  It's hard.  Wait a minute.  This reminds me of when I was a boy.  And I told Julie that I wanted her to sit in my lap when she was naked and she didn't want  to and I said, well, there's sticker bushes here and she chose the sticker bushes.  This is the same thing.  But only now she's choosing you.  She just chose you.  You didn't hear that?  No.  What did you say? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, you better off.  I'll do flying mouse traps.  Oh.  All right.  Well.  I thought she was going to do the Jimmy.  The way they flew past my face like that is like a cinch.  But what about Jimmy just rubbing himself in it?  No, I cannot do that.  No.  Okay.  Okay.  How about...  No.  Wow.  Why, Patty?  Can you see me, by the way?  You're really squinting.  I would love that if Jimmy just rammed it home.  I'm sorry.  It's how I act without my glasses.  I have to squint so I can focus. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  That's a hell of a sequence.  I can focus.  Falling out of it.  Oh, yeah.  Patty, how about this?  You just take out your bare bottom and I kind of put my penis between the cheeks and  you all go, huh?  No, I cannot.  I will not.  I will not.  I cannot.  No.  Well, could you say it at least in a sexier tone?  My body.  You're talking about my body.  Could you at least think about it?  Make Jimmy feel good?  I cannot.  No.  How about a um?  I will not.  I'll do the mouse traps over that because I don't want that to happen to me.  How about this, Patty? 
[03:36:00]  How about this?  We're playing deal or no deal.  Oh.  Not only do we have the mouse traps on the floor and your glasses, and you've got to  find the glasses amongst the mouse traps, on the floor will also be one rat trap.  Oh, wow.  Those will actually take a finger off.  The rat trap will break a bone.  That will break a knuckle.  They're like miniature bear traps.  Let me show you a rat trap, even though you can't see.  This is a rat trap. 
[03:36:30]  This is a rat trap.  Got teeth on it.  Oh, well.  Dude, that is a badger trap.  Put a pencil in there.  This is going to be on the ground as well.  All right?  You want this on Pal Talk?  Is it on Pal Talk?  Does it matter?  That's enough.  Ready?  Listen to this, Patty.  I can't see it.  What do you feel?  You'll hear it.  She can't see it.  Listen. 
[03:37:00]  Oh.  Now that could hurt.  She's like Mr. Magoo.  She can't see.  What did you put in there?  I couldn't see it.  It's a pen, but the pen is pretty much broken in half.  Oh, Magoo.  You've done it again.  So let's negotiate a little more here.  I won't have a boner.  My dick is very soft.  No, I cannot be violated.  You're not going to be violated.  How do you think I feel, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Jimmy, set up what you're willing to do.  If you show your bare bottom.  That's not that kind of a woman. 
[03:37:30]  All right.  But listen to Jimmy before.  What you'll do is this.  I would never put my penis in you because you're a...  I'm not a rapist.  But I...  Can she keep her panties on?  No, I...  No.  I don't even...  Shut your face.  Are you wearing thong?  Are you wearing a thong panty?  So like your cheek is hanging out a little?  No.  Big old lady bloomers?  Probably.  Is it a log in them?  I can't say.  She looks like she's staring into the sun. 
[03:38:00]  I know, that's squint.  Bill, you bring out the worst.  And that's why I got to tell you.  We haven't been this mean since the last time you were here.  You're full of shit.  Every time I come in here.  I have never seen a body like this.  Her hands are on her hips.  And it's like your stomach is coming out.  And your breasts are sinking in.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  So what's the deal, Jimmy?  Once again.  Here's what I'll do.  If you lean forward.  And you have to turn pal talk off for this.  Don't do that.  We're turning around.  I would...  I'm only packing like...  You want to feel it?  I'm only packing like four.  It's not much.  And I would just kind of gently rest it between your cheeks. 
[03:38:30]  I can't do that.  I'm sorry.  And we would count to 30.  No, I can't do that.  You did cherry darts.  Jimmy, no.  I can't do that.  Just like a cherry.  I'm a decent person.  I can't do that.  No, no.  Just so you know, I wouldn't put it in at all.  I'm a lady.  Let me see your hand.  I haven't been a lady.  I'm a lady.  I would put it on top of your cheeks.  Uh-uh.  Not in them.  Not between them.  I'm a lady.  I know.  Shut up.  How about 26 seconds?  All right.  Well...  You know, that's the thing.  I'm a lady.  I have a reputation for letting them be cheap or something. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  Well, then the rat trap is added...  Jesus.  ...to the mouse traps.  Ah!  Dude, that's going to break our finger.  You can't use that.  I understand, but we, you know...  Hey, this isn't free FM.  It's the deal we made.  You can use rat traps on XM.  It's the deal we made.  The rat trap is set.  It's up to you, Patty.  Patty.  I...  How about this?  How about...  I don't have a reputation.  What did you throw at...  The rat trap.  Don't put it...  Don't put it by her. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  They're all around you.  Don't move.  How about this?  If she holds my hog in her hand...  ...for five seconds.  Oh, my God.  But I'm not that kind of a lady.  People have an impression of me.  That isn't true.  Can she wear a glove?  If you wear...  You can wear a glove.  Like a doctor examining his...  Right.  You can hold my hog in your hand...  ...for five seconds with a glove on.  Here comes another rat trap.  Don't throw that, man. 
[03:40:00]  Don't move, Patty.  They're all around you like grenades.  Get one of those gloves.  Show her what the gloves look like.  Yeah, let's get a glove.  Wear one of the gloves.  In the cabinet.  Right.  All right, we're getting a glove.  And then show her a glove.  And then you just got to kind of...  ...give him a hernia exam.  By the way, Frank, from New York City.  Look at her eyes darting around the room.  Do you remember the end of Silence of the Lambs?  When she's walking through the basement?  With the night vision?  Yeah, the infrared.  That's what she looks like.  I'll start it.  Oh, no.  $20. 
[03:40:30]  What?  And not only get your glasses back...  ...you will get cold, hard cash...  ...to place Jimmy's hog...  ...in your left hand...  I'll match it.  ...that will be wearing a glove.  For five seconds.  No.  No, more than that?  Yeah.  All right, let me pee real quick.  All right.  There's another 20.  All right, the pot is up to 40.  Anybody else?  We'll accept dollar bills.  I understand that we got some...  ...some people that don't... 
[03:41:00]  ...have a lot of money on them right now.  Why are you looking at me?  I didn't look at you.  You're going to add 20?  Well...  I put 20 in.  Am I going to get a reputation now?  No.  No, no.  Your reputation is already ruined.  Doctors do this.  Yeah, Jimmy's just taking a leak right now, so...  Man, you can't throw 20 in.  Two singles.  Huh?  What's that?  All right, I'm all in then.  No, here.  Yeah, that's all.  That's all you need to do.  A couple singles.  It's up to $42, Patty.  It's either that or the rat traps and the mouse traps that are on the floor. 
[03:41:30]  And they're set.  Don't even move.  They're all around you right now.  Don't...  Don't look around.  Trust me.  Don't look down...  Ah!  One just went off.  Don't move.  All I remember is the breeze going by my face when those mouse traps went off last time.  That'll never be erased from my mind.  Well, you won't have to live through it if you...  Oh, Jesus.  Did Danny just get nailed with the rat trap?  Yeah.  He might have broke his thumb.  Wow, that had hurt.  And I'm not even kidding. 
[03:42:00]  I didn't think it was set, but I just touched it.  Keith's in for $10.  From Bam.  Oh, from Bam.  General Bam.  Even Bill, who makes no money, threw a couple bucks.  A lot of cash in there now.  And Bill Burr's in for $0.75.  Thank you, Bill.  No, no, no.  I only got the $100 of me.  He threw like $9.  All right, accepted.  $10.  All right.  Jimmy just...  Just priming it up.  All right.  All these guys in the room.  We'll take the...  Don't do that, dude.  That's going to hit someone's foot and break their foot.  Yeah, be careful. 
[03:42:30]  All right, Jimmy doesn't want the pal talk.  Absolutely.  No, no, no.  You can't aim it up anywhere.  It's got to be a buff.  Has to do it.  How about those DC cameras?  All right, yeah.  Cover those DC cameras up.  We don't know what's going on in here.  Yeah.  You don't have...  Only one glove, Patty.  I don't have...  One glove.  Come on.  There's nothing wrong with me.  You warts.  This is a black earl.  She's putting...  She's putting two gloves on.  So how long does she have to hold it for?  Should we check with Elo to make sure? 
[03:43:00]  Timer.  I don't want you to get screwed over this.  Yeah, me neither.  Quickly.  Quickly.  Be responsible.  All right.  We're going to be responsible for once.  Yeah.  We want to keep our jobs.  All right.  Someone set up the deal or no deal.  All right.  Here it is, Patty.  We have your glasses and roughly...  I don't know.  50 some odd dollars there.  20, 40, 60, 65.  At least 70.  All right.  70 bucks or so over there. 
[03:43:30]  And your glasses.  They are up for grabs.  You either have to crawl around on the floor with rat traps and mouse traps and find your glasses.  Could be very hurtful.  Very hurtful.  You could get injured.  Or your other option with your gloved hand, your latex gloved hand, like any doctor would do, any professional would do.  Oh, my God.  Let me read that. 
[03:44:00]  You would then grab Jimmy's mule and hold it for a set amount of time.  Can we do this?  We haven't determined yet.  Can we do this bit?  Yeah.  I hope he is on the phone now with Elo.  Oh, this is always awkward to explain something to your boss.  Checking it out.  Well, Elo, this is what we want to do.  Stark and Patty is wearing a glove on her left hand.  Latex glove.  Latex glove.  She wants to get her glasses back. 
[03:44:30]  We have some cash that we're going to give after the bit just because we're nice guys.  And Jimmy is just going to place something in her left hand for 30 seconds.  In her gloved hand.  In her gloved hand.  Something in her hand.  All right.  Right.  All right.  Look, it's his paw.  What are you doing? 
[03:45:00]  Uh-huh.  All right.  He's still explaining.  All right.  For this.  So we don't know what's going to be in Patty's hand, right, Elo?  Yeah.  We have no idea what's in Patty's hand.  I don't know.  Something tells me I don't need to talk during this bit.  Why don't we paper up that window?  All right, Elo.  How's everything else?  Can we just throw out the people that are in there? 
[03:45:30]  All right.  Bye.  That we don't know.  All right.  No.  Anyone we don't know has to leave that room.  Okay.  Everyone else can stay.  What kind of stand-up guy am I?  I'm not even going to look, so I can't testify.  Come on.  I want you to look.  I'm priming it for you.  You're smart.  I went to the Untouchables last night.  Here we go.  See?  First of all, officially, this is just something that it's a loan just for a goose.  No, no, no.  Watch this.  Watch what I do now.  Patty, it's not enough to get glasses, but I... 
[03:46:00]  Anthony, Bill Burr, and the rest of the gang, including little Jimmy Norton, for your troubles  today, I want you to have this.  Wow.  What a loophole you found.  There you go.  Yeah, that'll hold up in court.  Well, the judge will say, oh, you worded it right.  Got us.  Darn it.  I love whenever we try to be legal eagles.  Oh, technically.  The cop doesn't have his headlights on.  He can't ticket you. 
[03:46:30]  Good point.  Jimmy, you're not going to feel any sexual gratification from this, correct?  It's an impossibility.  There you go.  Perfect.  All right.  Patty.  Patty.  You want your glasses back, right?  Yeah.  I hold in my hand...  Glasses.  She's going to hold in her hand something that resembles a pimple.  Come here.  Come over here.  Come over here.  I don't have to look. 
[03:47:00]  Shut up, would you?  Put your hand down.  I'm sorry.  Here he goes.  Now wrap your hand around it.  Wrap your hand around it.  Wrap your hand around it.  You got to hold it.  Hold it.  Wrap your hand.  Well...  Two.  Wrap tighter.  Wrap your hand tighter.  You can't just hold the helmet, you goose.  I've never done this before in my world.  Me neither with a non-human...  Patty.  Close the blanket door.  Patty, wrap your hand tighter. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, well...  I've never done it before.  Now pretend you're starting a lawnmower.  Oh my God.  How is it, Jim?  How is it?  Your exam did more for you than this would do for me.  All right, Patty.  Oh my God.  What do you think?  I don't like the fact that she's only...  Just give it one good...  Is she weeping or laughing?  Laughing.  I don't know what to say.  Okay, just...  Just like...  Oh, I'm going to hear it from the people on Palpock tonight. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, you might.  Just go left and right a little bit.  All right.  Give it a little tug.  All right, Patty.  Oh, she gave it a tug.  I have never done anything like that.  Well, we don't even know what you did.  Here you go.  Here's your glasses.  What she did in her whole life.  Now throw those away.  Yeah, I have to.  They're inside out.  I think Patty has no idea what she was doing because she didn't have her glasses on.  There she goes.  Oh, I don't have to squint anymore.  That was all I did.  Hi, Patty.  Welcome back.  Welcome back. 
[03:48:30]  Thank you.  Did Dummy almost open the door?  Ben.  Ben came in.  Ben was very interested in what was going on.  Oh, okay.  Ben.  All right, Patty.  I'm so embarrassed.  Me too.  Yeah.  No, that was fun.  Wow.  I'm sure it was.  This whole show needs a shower now.  Oh, I am disgusted.  I'm ready to die.  I thought it was very sanitary.  Yeah.  It was done very sanitary.  Jim was well shaven.  Oh, you noticed?  Thank you, Bill.  Very good.  Oh, my God. 
[03:49:00]  It'll be an experience.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, an experience.  Brings me back to the first time I met you in the studio or something.  Oh, what happened there?  Me and you?  Yeah, he opened his fly for 30 seconds.  Fly.  Fly.  No, I touched you.  I was the first man to ever touch your breasts.  Right.  I touched your nipples.  That's what it was.  Then they made you get up and, you know, unzip you and do that.  I took my headphones off halfway. 
[03:49:30]  Huh?  Yeah.  I got to take my headphones off halfway when she's talking.  I know.  Your voice is really annoying, Patty.  All right, Patty.  Thank you for stopping by.  Stopping her voice is a fun perceptive.  For Anthony's birthday.  And we really appreciate everything you do for the show.  That was wonderful.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Have fun at work.  Congratulations on the new gig.  Thank you.  All right.  There she goes.  Stalker Patty.  All right.  I'm going to get her.  What happened, Patty?  What happened?  Wait, Patty, Patty.  What happened?  There you go.  Go to your job, you filthy whore.  There she goes.  That's right.  Give Hooker the money. 
[03:50:00]  Slut.  No, we're keeping the money.  We should.  For legal reasons.  That's right.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Yes, we're still live.  Hi.  Bill Burr in studio promoting a gig in Philly.  Yeah.  I'm going to be at the Electric Factory with Greg Giraldo on May 19th.  That's a great show right there. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Fucking Giraldo's great.  Both guys great.  Absolutely.  And the fans, I'm sure, will support the Bill Burr show in Philly.  Very cool.  And you're going to come over to the other place when we do Yo Mama?  Yeah.  Big A and Twitchels, hopefully this Friday.  I've got to try to get out of some other stuff to get up there.  All right.  Yeah, we'll try for Friday on that, okay?  Let's say hi to Franco in Oceanside.  Franco, what's going on?  Franco.  What's going on, guys?  Hi, Franco.  Thanks for calling the program.  All right.  Happy birthday, Anthony. 
[03:51:00]  Thank you.  No doubt that that last bit is going to go down as a classic.  So I want to ask all those people who've been bitching for the last week, are you still  bitching?  Are you still complaining?  They still are.  Actually, hold on.  Hold on, Franco.  Actually, yes.  Rick is complaining in Florida.  Rick?  Hi.  Hi, Rick.  You're talking to Franco from Oceanside.  What's up, Rick?  You complaining?  I think, yeah, I think this is a bunch of bullshit, man.  This is a bunch of hypocritical, listening to you guys say, oh, yeah, the move is to 
[03:51:30]  XM, and you guys did all this, you know, complaining about Stern, man.  There's no difference.  You guys are whores.  You punked us.  You just...  They're whores?  Punk?  They're whores?  We didn't hear the best part on XM while the people on Free FM went to work without  hearing shit.  We just heard the best part.  And then tomorrow we'll get shit on Free FM, and then we'll hear even better shit on  XM tomorrow.  Bullshit.  I paid my money.  Now you guys go over there.  So did I.  I paid my money, too.  I work three jobs. 
[03:52:00]  I don't give a shit.  If you don't want to pay the money, don't pay it anymore.  That's all.  If you can do it, I mean, that's it.  I'm not going to pay the money.  Rick, the fact is the show is going to get much better because of the move we made.  Trust me on that.  The guy from Florida, you're a real fan of the show, right?  You're just concerned that you've been a fan, and you paid something, and you're going  to lose something.  And you think that we bitched about how bad radio is, and now we're doing it, and you  feel like we kind of sold you out a little bit.  Absolutely.  100% you sold me. 
[03:52:30]  Dude, dude.  Relax, dude.  I paid my money.  Listen.  I paid my money when you guys first got on.  Paid it for your show.  Listen to you.  Listen to you guys give me the hypocritical line about how, you know, this is the move.  The move, the move, all of that shit.  It is.  I swallowed it, man, and now you stuffed it up my ass.  Dude, do you not understand that this is just going to turn more people to XM?  Once the 3FM show goes off the air at 9 a.m., they're going to be like, oh, listen, we're  going to go continue the awesome show on XM.  We're doing both.  Do you want to hear that? 
[03:53:00]  Rick, let me ask.  Hey, Rick.  Rick in Florida.  Let me ask you a question.  When is, and this is how good it is for the show.  When's the last time you saw a big Opie and Anthony ad anywhere?  For real?  On the back of my van.  How about that?  Okay.  And I appreciate that.  Point is, this is going to get the advertising for the show up a lot.  The marketing.  A lot is going to change, man.  It's a big move for the show.  Ben just ran in here with a whole bunch of bands that want to play on our show now because  we're talking to a much bigger audience. 
[03:53:30]  That's the reality of this.  We get better guests, more content for the show.  And you're not getting much less like unedited programming.  Yeah, we're up to five hours of radio.  When they go to commercials on the terrestrial stations, we're doing all sorts of bonus material  and that's even going to get better.  We're developing all sorts of features.  We're still working on it.  So, you know, you've got to at least give it a chance, man.  I'll give it a chance, but I still feel sold out right now.  Well, don't be a goose. 
[03:54:00]  Give it some time.  Hey, hey, Jimmy.  I don't mean to use that language, but forgive me for being so hard.  The people who say that you guys sold out, honestly, to me, those people are the sellouts  because if they can't support the show, they're sellouts.  Well, they want to make sure, look, in fairness to them, they want to make sure that they're  not getting douched.  I mean, you spend money on a unit.  And we did trash free radio and they're going, why are you guys doing it?  And, you know.  Because without us, they stunk.  Exactly.  The stupid argument, why would I pay for something I can listen to for free?  Well, you can't.  You certainly weren't going to hear Stalker Patty. 
[03:54:30]  You can't.  That whole thing on free radio.  You can't listen?  Yeah.  We've done two extra hours of radio that all those other people can't hear.  And all the bonus material when they go to commercial that the other people can't hear.  And you can hear the show whenever you want.  So if you have a one-hour commute, I mean, do we have to sell you on replays?  You listen to the show?  Come on, man.  You guys know the difference.  There's plenty of upside here, my friend.  All right.  And I think for our first day, we did a fantastic job.  And it's going to only get better.  Hey, no Phil DePaul wants in here.  Does he? 
[03:55:00]  He's really depressed.  As he should be.  What does he want to ruin now?  Hawk never gets mad at people.  Hawk's easy going.  I love the E-Rock today.  The anger he showed, he got really pissed off because he had it all set up that he was  going to throw the entire cake.  It's a huge sheet cake, by the way.  Do you think he pictured Paul with everybody from production's head on his shoulders?  Like for that moment of anger, he saw Than and Derek and everybody?  No, here's what he saw.  He saw that cake flying into Patty's face and head and everyone applauding and Ope going, 
[03:55:30]  you did it.  And the hug.  Yeah.  And the hug.  And it was all taken away by some stupid linemen.  And it was spoiled by a man, as Bill brilliantly put it, with a Bronson hairdo.  E-Rock and I were kind of bonding there.  E-Rock had it all figured out.  He was ready to do it.  And then, no filter Paul, the guy is ridiculous.  He gets so overly excited all the time.  You're just a dope.  Did you miss the other little thing he screwed up? 
[03:56:00]  Huh.  When Patty was talking outside, right?  Patty was talking outside on mic and she was crying and we wanted to listen in.  Paul opened the door and waved her into the studio.  Because someone said, we want it in.  Yeah, but then we went, no, no, no.  I know, I was just right by the door.  You're an observer.  But it was too late by then.  You had already invited her in and ruined the whole moment of her weeping outside.  He just gets so excited.  He gets so excited. 
[03:56:30]  And as for the other thing, I was actually just helping Eric pick up the cake and I cut  my hair.  He didn't need your help.  I love making fun of E-Rock, but he did not need your help there.  Eric, why don't you get on mic?  You blocked that one.  The hawk is hot under the collar.  He's still pissed off.  It was his moment.  What's up, Eric?  He's an asshole.  Thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  You're obnoxious.  You need show time more than any other person that I've ever seen.  Is my name dugout dug now?  Jesus Christ.  No, see, you can't shut your fucking mouth for one minute, can you? 
[03:57:00]  Oh, oh, shit.  This is like your mama.  Oh.  Oh.  E-Rock.  You had Starker Patty lined up nice, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He knew it was.  He was going like UFC.  Right in his sights.  Yeah.  Eric a cordless in case he wants to pipe in.  Get that boy.  It's right there.  Okay.  But no filter.  Paul got a hold of me during the break.  Hey, Paul.  Paul, how was your arraignment? 
[03:57:30]  Oh, damn.  Oh, you're dead.  He's wearing that men in black suit.  He already looked.  Men in black with the risky business sunglasses.  Gentlemen, I believe there are aliens' ships at the World's Fair.  No filter, Paul.  So you grabbed a hold of me outside the studio.  What did you say?  Let's bring it to the air.  I said I fucked up a bit, and I'll take my punishment from you guys.  Oh.  You have a body like a pregnant snake. 
[03:58:00]  You know what I don't like either?  How young is Facebook?  Yeah.  Shame about the rest, right?  I've never seen a 12-year-old with a double chin.  So what happened, Paul?  What do you say to open?  I just said it.  I said I fucked up a bit, and I'll take my punishment, whatever you guys want to dish  out, so.  Is your head getting smaller?  Yeah, he's fucking.  I'm serious.  No, I think my stomach's getting big.  I'm sorry.  All right, well.  It's all relative.  So what do you want to do?  He's like a starving. 
[03:58:30]  Talk to you guys.  I fucked up your bed.  Starving African.  Whatever you want.  With vitiligo.  See, this is the deal.  He knows there's a lot of hatred out there for him, and he knows the pal talk people are  going to kill him.  He doesn't give a fuck about pal talk.  He don't care.  You're such a liar.  You sit outside the studio.  No, pal talk.  Whatever.  I don't care.  I know I fucked up a bit.  They'll all get him.  You did say pal talk, though.  So.  Well, that was who I was told.  You know what you can be assured of, though?  And thank God for this.  There will not be one Photoshop of you screwing bits up.  Yeah, really?  Not a one. 
[03:59:00]  I don't see one person making a Photoshop of you screwing bits up.  Sonny Farrelly.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  Paul, you're such a fucking blimey British, motherfucking clock-blocking son of a bitch,  motherfucking fucking cum whore.  Whore.  Clean it up well.  Thank God this call didn't come in before nine.  We rebroadcast that tomorrow morning.  Hey, boys, I love the fucking move.  This was fucking great for you guys.  I really think it's going to be great for the show, too.  You're going to have to wait and see on that one, okay? 
[03:59:30]  It's going to bring all kinds of new angles, material, characters to the program.  Oh, I know what that is.  There you go, Anthony.  This is some good stuff.  Thank you, Sonny Farrelly.  You're welcome, sir.  We're getting more gifts coming in.  This is from Caroline.  Dear ONA, congratulations on your return to terrestrial radio.  It just wasn't the same without you.  It's been such a great pleasure working with you over the years.  We look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.  We'll all be tuning in to see how you take the show to even greater heights 
[04:00:00]  and wish you both all the best for continued success with warm regards,  your friends and fans at Caroline's on Broadway.  Can I tell you what kind of a class act Caroline's is?  Bottle of Dom.  The Dom.  That's what they do.  You guys can give Jimmy's his, too.  No cheap champagne.  They give the Dom.  You can give Jimmy his present, too, live in the air.  Where's my present, Steve?  From Caroline's?  Yeah.  Steve went to go find Jimmy's gift from Caroline's. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, good.  He and OBE each got the bottle of Dom.  It's not like they haven't sold out the room on many, many, many, many occasions.  Well, I don't drink alcohol, so.  Steve?  Where's the Caroline's gift for Jimmy?  We're all waiting.  Perhaps it's on its way.  There must have been another gift, aside from alcohol, because Jimmy doesn't drink.  Right, exactly.  Jimmy doesn't drink.  So there was another Caroline's gift.  What is it?  Maybe they're having trouble getting it up the elevator, Jim.  Oh.  Is it a piano?  Maybe they're going to let you emcee. 
[04:01:00]  Is it a...  Well, Ben's in charge of the whole show.  I'm sure maybe Ben has it.  Ben has the skinny on it.  Get Ben in here with my gift.  Get the executive producer of the Opinion Anthem show in here.  Gift time is coming, Bill.  Settle down.  Doesn't fat head have the skinny on anything.  All right.  We're getting Ben to see where Jimmy's gift is from Caroline's.  Greg Charles from Caroline's sent the gifts up, right?  Yeah, Poe just gave it to me.  All right.  Gentlemen.  Huh?  There was nothing for you.  It just said Opinion Anthony.  Are these gifts free? 
[04:01:30]  They're free.  It's free.  They put food on Caroline's.  Oh, that has to hurt.  Oh.  No, no.  That's okay.  I'm sure Greg has something for you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure you...  Why bring it up now?  I'm sure you know.  Why?  Let me tell you.  It's not like a good bottle of Dom goes for, you know, 150, something like that.  Right.  Sure.  So you probably couldn't get anything good for that amount of money anyway.  Probably not.  You better reach for your box. 
[04:02:00]  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  Bill Burr.  You want to explain to Bill Burr?  I'd rather not.  It's embarrassing.  No, it's not.  It's not.  It works.  I think I kind of got it.  Well, uh...  Yeah, Patty did it.  Whenever he's feeling a little low...  Oh, okay.  That's right.  Yes.  They're called a box of...  Tender Sentiments.  Tender Sentiments.  And it's a great idea.  It's a little box, and it has tender sentiments written on it, and it's full of little tender sentiments.  Jimmy gets upset. 
[04:02:30]  He pulls one out.  Shake it up good, Jimmy.  Basically, if nobody loves you or says nice things to you,  right.  All right, Jimmy, calm down.  Jesus.  Here he goes.  All right, here we go.  Pull out one and read it.  This will make him feel better.  You are a spark of divine love.  Didn't I have that one already?  You already had that sentiment.  I think you ought to pick a new one until we get a new one.  Yes.  Because the past three, we've heard already.  Well, here's what we do. 
[04:03:00]  Rip it up.  Ooh.  All right.  Great.  Rebroadcast.  Tender Sentiments.  Bill, take it out.  All right.  Even the goddamn tender sentiments are in Best Of.  All right, shake it up.  Shake it up.  Let it rip.  Come on.  Chuck Norris.  Shake it up.  Oh, I know.  In the building.  Here we go.  That looks like a long one.  It is.  You are a beautiful and unique snowflake.  Like snowflakes, which are all different, Jimmy. 
[04:03:30]  You are indeed different and beautiful.  I'm beautiful and unique like a snowflake.  That is indeed a tender sentiment.  And in a weird way, being unique is I am because you two got gifts and I didn't.  And I am a snowflake because I was left out in the cold.  But no, I mean, I've had a...  Jimmy.  But at least you got a good gift from WISP.  Yeah, no, it's good to... 
[04:04:00]  You know, you expect that from the press.  Not from your friends.  You expect it from Pittsburgh or Fort Lauderdale where they don't know the show that well.  Right.  But not from people who you've known for years.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Virginia Beach.  Kevin, what's up?  Yeah, I don't think he fires Paul enough.  I think you should make him have to hold Jimmy's cock.  Make him pay by holding Jimmy's cock.  But you have to understand, sir, I didn't ruin a bit. 
[04:04:30]  Right.  I've been the victim here.  Yes.  So, you know everyone's going to be mad at you.  So, what do you want to do about it?  No filter, Paul.  Oh, wait a minute.  E-Rock's got something.  I don't want him punished because it's just going to give him more air time.  You don't want to make him a martyr.  No.  I want him...  I'm asking Anthony to ban him.  Wow.  I've never banned anyone from the studio before.  No, I think I want to see No Filter Paul put his hand in the rat trap. 
[04:05:00]  And to tell you the truth, E-Rock, I understand your point, I understand your anger, but this  idiot here comes up with things that are very useful for me.  Makes it so I don't have to leave the house so often, let's say.  Although what E-Rock is doing is this.  This is what the moment was.  Why would I ban him?  And we completely understand and side with E-Rock and his anger.  But what's happening right now, it's like that scene in... 
[04:05:30]  What was the Mel Gibson movie?  Christ.  Passion of the Christ.  Passion of the Christ.  I was called Braveheart.  No, lethal weapon!  When they're beating Christ so badly...  It's Braveheart with hymns.  And Anthony just kind of came out and said, I wanted this man flogged, not beaten to death.  You're like one of the Roman guards who, even though you're doing your job, you're overzealous.  Or I could just go, I could look at you and go,  This I cannot do.  Yes.  Because it does not fit the crime. 
[04:06:00]  Exactly.  Well, if you...  My daughter, they took her...  Why did they spoil you a bit, Eric?  It was going to be your big moment on the show.  What do you think, Paul?  This is a rat trap.  And if you put it in wrong, it will break a finger.  Even if you put it in...  I promise you, it will break a finger.  Look what it did to this...  I'm afraid it will take a piece of the finger off.  Yeah.  Look what it did to this pen.  Yeah.  For real.  Huh?  Thumbs up?  He'll do it.  All right.  I'm going to go from no filter to no finger, Paul. 
[04:06:30]  No finger, Paul.  All right.  I think it's only fair, Anthony.  He did wreck one of our bits today.  E-Rock, once you gladly place the trap, the rat trap, put this on Pal Talk, just in case  people think we're just messing with a cute little mouse trap.  This thing is truly a bear trap.  That is something you use for a badger.  It's going to cut his finger off.  A raccoon.  Badger.  It's going to cut his finger off.  Wolverine.  Nasty.  A wolverine.  It's one of those Tasmanian devil. 
[04:07:00]  Don't...  Yeah, something that could chase a bear up a tree.  Holy crap.  You are the stupidest man alive.  I knew that.  It's going to snap your finger.  I'm asking him where I...  I wanted to put this part down.  You almost just casually did it.  That will snap your finger in two places, by the way.  No, I assumed Eric was going to just move it wherever he wanted anyway, so he put it  on your balls.  He's pissed at you.  Someone suggested that outside.  Just put it down and stick your hand in.  This guy, you truly are a dope.  You're going to...  No.  Oh, my...  He's going to break his hand.  You think?  I'll hold my hand still. 
[04:07:30]  Where would you put it open?  How about shutting up and listening?  Oh!  With a practical point.  I would have to, unfortunately, it's still going to hurt, but first of all, palm up.  Why?  It's going to break his freaking hand.  Oh, so you think when it smacks down the top of his hand.  I don't think it is.  I don't think it is.  It'll still hurt really bad, but at least it'll have a little cushion on this part.  I see.  I think you're overreacting.  He was ready to put his fingers in directly.  I think that's what he should do.  That would have broke at least two to three fingers.  Oh, my God. 
[04:08:00]  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  He's really going to...  I like it.  Wait.  Verbally say that you're not going to hold it.  Hold us responsible when you have to go to the ER.  No, it's fine.  Huh?  Say it.  It's fine.  No, I'm dead serious.  I accept all liability for this.  I accept liability.  I have health insurance.  It's fine.  Well, why don't you put it down here on the table, then?  Yeah, let's snap right up.  That works.  All right, Mike.  Look at us lawyers again.  Oh, my God.  What a...  Yeah, do it that way.  Do it that way.  This is...  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to set this up for radio.  No filter, Paul. 
[04:08:30]  Screwed up one of our bits today.  Keep that pinky away.  I'm telling you, it'll snap right off your hand.  Look what it did to the pens.  Where's my pen that it did?  Your pen is in half.  It snapped the hip off.  Hey, Jim, you want to take out a tender sentiment to read to him right afterwards?  You could always learn to play left-handed concertos.  Paul.  Yes, sir.  You are a beautiful half a snowflake.  I know it's hard for you to follow things, but between here and the wrist. 
[04:09:00]  The fatty part of your hand.  It's still going to hurt like a mother, but hopefully it won't break the ball.  Hurt like the dickens.  I got to touch that bit down?  That bit.  All right.  Here's no filter, Paul.  Hand is shaking.  No shit.  So is mine.  Hand to a rat trap.  Oh.  Ah!  Fucking cunt!  Oh!  Oh, fuck!  Holy fuck!  That'll stink.  That's going to be the mark.  Are we square now, Eric, or do I have to do the other hand?  One more.  One more.  What have you other hand? 
[04:09:30]  Wait, let me see what that did to that hand.  That does hurt, right?  There's a couple of teeth dicks.  It wasn't quite as bad as I expected because I was clenching my hand.  I knew it was going to hurt.  I think Eric's feeling a little too much power, and we ought to make him stick his hand in it.  It's absolutely fine, Eric.  No, I, because I think it being down on a solid surface did, you know.  Oh, maybe you're right.  So why don't we...  Suspend it?  Yeah.  Have someone hold it?  You know what I'm thinking?  Jump up.  What do you think, E-Rock?  You're the one that's pissed off at him.  One more, and we're good.  All right.  And where's that going?  Just the thumb. 
[04:10:00]  How about the head of your cock?  Yeah.  That one's been snapped so many times today.  Why don't we go for a fresh one?  Ah, Danny.  A fresh one.  Good point, Danny.  Good point, Danny.  The springs might be a little weak.  This kid's moving up in the organization.  He sure is.  $5.50 an hour for you.  That's what I say.  That's what I agree with.  Well, a little less.  Can I see what I'm getting?  All right.  Make sure this is on camera there.  Here we go.  No filter, Paul.  E-Rock, let it go.  Don't give it any...  Mow. 
[04:10:30]  Is it going to fucking go?  Oh, my God.  Oh, fucking God.  Oh, fuck.  The English love that word.  That one is definitely much worse than the other one.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  That really bit down.  Oh, shit.  Keith, the cop ain't buying it.  Look how much his hand is shaking.  I'm not.  That's called trauma.  But, Keith, don't forget his snap, though.  Yeah, when it snaps.  No, it's all about the snap.  No, no, you've got to let the bottom jump up and get you.  Yeah.  It catches right there. 
[04:11:00]  It catches.  Oh.  Oh.  You know, you've been through training.  Yeah.  You've had mace.  Are you faking the pain there?  No, the second one hurt.  The first one stung a little.  The second one didn't hurt.  You have been tasered?  Yes.  I think he's faking it.  You think he's faking it?  I think he's faking it.  Oh, my God.  He just put his fingers right in it.  Nothing.  It hurts a little, right?  So give me some more.  Keith is all man, though.  He really is a fucking macho fella.  Yeah.  Look.  In his own way, he's ruining this bit.  I was going to say, I'm keeping score here. 
[04:11:30]  Keith has ruined two bits today.  Bill Burr won.  On two separate platforms.  I want just punishment because he fucks up a lot of things.  In Boston, he fucked up things.  Kenny and I had to talk to him.  And he constantly needs to be corrected.  And I think he deserves just punishment.  Why don't you just kick him in the balls?  There you go.  Now we're talking.  Okay.  I think I saw the way he pushed E-Rock out of the way.  When we see the tape, and you see E-Rock's face, and you see Paul jumping in, I think  just punishment.  I think he deserves more.  I got an idea.  Do we have a tape of that?  Let's watch the tape. 
[04:12:00]  Oh.  We got it on video.  I didn't mean to interrupt your idea, but I think we should do that.  And then...  I got an idea.  All right.  How about make a little sign with paper that says, I'm an asshole.  And you put it on, you know, his leg or something.  With the swing line.  Stapler.  I have a worse punishment.  Okay. 
[04:12:30]  How about we make him a box of unhappy sentiments?  And he has to pick one.  See, the cruel side of you that comes through, Jimmy, it just shreds that nice image.  It's just terrific.  No.  Those are E-Rocks.  All right.  Start writing the sign.  For times when Eric's feeling bad.  I'm an asshole.  Dude, you have such a huge belly.  Nothing's going to...  Hey, it's up to Eric.  He's the one.  Eric, would you like to staple a sign to his belly?  I would love to.  Danny can write this sign like he signs his own name.  I like this new angry side of E-Rock. 
[04:13:00]  I like it, too.  Yeah, angry E-Rock.  This has been pent up in him for a while.  It's like when the first George Bush tried to get tough.  Yeah.  He's E-Hulk.  He's changed.  All right.  All right.  I am an asshole.  What are you doing?  Are you doing it in calligraphy?  Yes.  Stupid.  I'm making it big so everybody can see it.  Yeah, don't talk like that.  I think they already know.  Kermit.  Hey, I'm a little bit.  All right.  All right.  Here we go. 
[04:13:30]  He says, I am an asshole.  I am an asshole.  And boy, is that plain as day to read.  What do you think?  He's got a leg.  One right in the thigh.  Oh, man.  I was thinking belly.  Belly?  I always heard if he gets shot in the belly, it takes a really long time to die, but the  pain is clutch.  It's going to be okay.  Won't throw anything in the belly.  Oh, wait.  He's saying he's like a belly.  All right.  And he's at the leg.  Whatever you want to do.  If his belly is pierced, I'm afraid he'll just pop.  Yeah, really?  Fly around the room.  All right.  He says that.  Whatever you guys want to do.  All right.  Go against the wall. 
[04:14:00]  She had a baby, man.  All right.  Marvin Nash.  Someone hold the mic so we can hear this.  Stop.  This is what's happening.  Iraq has a stapler in his hand.  He's got a sign that says, I'm an asshole.  How do I look?  Paul is up against the wall.  Jimmy?  What, baby?  I can't say.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Come on.  Let me move so energy.  I would have moved, but I'm sick.  No.  Do you stay there, baby?  Let me see the gut.  Jesus.  That's not bad.  Wow.  That's a lot of padding. 
[04:14:30]  All right.  A couple of abs in there.  One right in the middle, huh?  Push hard.  Oh, now that's fucking hard.  God.  Yeah, but we need a couple more staples.  It's got to stay.  It's got to stay.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That hurt.  Now stable Keith and see if that fucking hurts.  Can you let go of the paper?  Will it stay?  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, no, but the staples are in them.  Dude, the staples are in them.  It wasn't the sign.  It ripped the paper. 
[04:15:00]  That's good.  Oh, shit.  Great.  Now, I think, but he's not getting the humiliation.  All he got was the pain.  Well, I think Bill might be on or something.  So, what we need, we need a lot more sturdier material that's going to stay this next time.  Oh, my God.  It's too soft, this one.  You got a nail gun?  Whatever you want to do.  You want to try the belly again, Iraq?  We staple until it stays.  We staple until it stays.  That's the method. 
[04:15:30]  What he did was he pulled the sign and then it made a hole and then it was able to release, whatever.  You're kind of crushing right through the paper there, Iraq.  That's a great bumper sticker for you guys.  We staple until it stays.  Here we go.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh!  The intestine, that one.  I didn't stay, though.  Iraq, Iraq, here's a little physics lesson.  What you got to do is put it there and instead of pressing like that, give it a jab.  That way the staple will stay put because its mass is more than the staple itself. 
[04:16:00]  Here we go.  What?  Watch.  Forget it.  There we go.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you got to send Anthony a card.  He just saved you at least another 20 staples.  How did you know that?  Well, this one was Professor Anthony.  It's the same principle as pulling a tablecloth out from underneath things on a table.  Of course it is.  You want me to explain it?  I prefer you didn't.  And how do you, where did you learn that? 
[04:16:30]  Discovery Channel.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  All right.  I'm glad I could help.  We got a good video of that for the website.  Good job.  Paul, I think, has paid his debt.  Now what he has to do, no.  He's got to pull his shirt like Charlie's Angels used to do.  Oh, and tie it up like this.  Pull it down.  A little mid-drift top.  What's your scar there, Bill?  Oh, me.  I got stabbed at a Hooters concert. 
[04:17:00]  All right.  We're getting gay.  I don't know what to believe.  Anthony really needs to go back to bed.  I need sleep.  I had an appendix.  Oh, me too.  Burst it on me.  Me too.  My parents, both being in the healthcare industry, are like, why would you go to the hospital?  Got a bellyache.  What are they going to do for you?  All right.  Paul has paid his debt.  Thank you.  No filter, Paul.  No filter, Paul.  You are now square with the show.  Paul, can you just grab my gift from Caroline and bring it in? 
[04:17:30]  Might take me a couple of minutes.  Yeah, this is the grand finale of today's show.  Yes, I know you guys are goofing on me.  Like, I understand the humiliation of YFP, a station that I've been friendly with, completely,  you know, snubbing me.  But Caroline's, one of my homes here in New York, would never.  I would like to just separate myself from Jimmy and thank Caroline's, who was there during the two years that we were off the air.  Now, normally, a comedy club or a friend of the show wants something in return. 
[04:18:00]  The two years we were off the air, we weren't plugging shows.  You know, we didn't have a show.  So, yet, whenever we went down to Caroline's, they treated us like royalty and always have.  And I love the people down there at Caroline's.  You know what?  Thank you.  I didn't want to say this because I thought it would upset Jimmy, but Greg Charles from Caroline's actually sent me a power bar.  Yeah.  When he found out that you guys were, you know.  What?  It was something.  Yeah.  It's a gesture.  It was something.  It's kind of funny you guys weren't plugging shows for the two years you were off, but guess who was? 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Bill Byrne, you might join the show Friday.  I am.  I got to try to get out of some shit because I really want to see that Yo Mama.  All right.  On Friday, it's your idea, for God's sake.  On Friday, we're going to try some Yo Mama with Big A and Twitchels and maybe other people from the show.  Okay.  Hey, you're playing the Electric Factory in Philly over the weekend?  No, no, no.  May 19th.  Oh, May 19th. 
[04:19:00]  I'm sorry.  The Electric Factory.  Electric Factory.  In Philadelphia.  May 19th.  With Greg Girald.  That's a great show.  Yep.  And I have one thing to plug.  It's May 11th.  It's Thursday, May 11th.  It's a comedy club in New York.  I had my problems with Gotham.  Mazzilli called me.  I apparently straightened it out, but I'm doing a benefit at Gotham.  It's for my friend, Savio.  I'm going to be there, too.  You're doing that gig with me.  All right.  It's not with me, with us.  It's his son.  He's a very good friend to the comedians.  His son is cancer.  He's like six.  So it's me, Bill Burr. 
[04:19:30]  Who else is doing it?  Patrice O'Neill.  Rich.  And Rich Voss.  And the show is absolutely...  Colin Quinn, I think.  Remember, go on before Patrice, so you get on.  Yeah.  So May 11th, Thursday, Gotham Comedy Club here in New York.  I guess I don't have any of the details other than to say that the show will absolutely sell out.  Myself, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neill, Voss, and possibly Colin.  That is a hell of a line-up.  Yeah.  Very good.  This is what we're going to do.  I just got word that they're bringing your gift in, Jimmy, from Caroline.  So just sit there and wait. 
[04:20:00]  All right?  We're going to go home.  No, we're just...  We have to do the interview with the New York Post.  So you just sit there anxiously waiting for your gift, Jimmy.  Okay?  Bill Burr, thank you.  The Electric Factory, May 19th in Philly, yes.  I just kind of feel like you're saying that because it's not going to be coming.  What happened?  Well, this time I'm going to prove you wrong.  Bit ruiner.  Old bit-blowing Bill.  All right.  So Anthony's going to bed.  Happy birthday, my buddy.  Why are you saying goodbye to Anthony? 
[04:20:30]  A little shot.  No, we have to go...  We're saying goodbye on the air.  You stay.  You're doing the grand finale by yourself.  Ooh.  Just wait for the gift from Caroline's.  We have to go do the interview with the New York Post.  We have to cancel Hannity and Combs and all the other press for today.  Until Anthony gets better.  Oh.  Come on, Ant.  Bill Burr.  I was just taking my robo-tussin.  All right, guys.  Robo-tussin.  All right.  Looking for me?  Hey, good luck with that Lucky Louie thing, man.  When's my gift coming?  I thought you were going to be a big star.  I just got to wipe out my little cup so it doesn't get sticky. 
[04:21:00]  I never like sticky cups.  We have that in common.  And now, let me take my...  Is anybody coming off the elevator?  My little present from...  Where's my gift?  Caroline's?  He's on his way, Jimmy.  He's on his way.  I don't need anything else.  I bet it's a special gift because I feel bad that they snubbed me.  It is special.  I heard that he just got buzzed in down at the lobby.  Greg Charles is on his way up.  My gift.  My special gift.  It's on its way, Jimmy.  Just stay there. 
[04:21:30]  Everything will work out fine.  You're a trooper.  You have integrity.  Be the best you can be.  I don't think my gift is coming. 
[04:22:00]  I'm going to go now.  Thanks, everyone, for listening. 
[04:22:30]  You are a firm-breasted something.  I am.  I am.  Where's my gift? 
[04:23:00]  Ohp.  Is Greg here?  Is Greg here?  People are happy to see you. 
[04:23:30]  People are always happy to see me.  Just not people from YSP.  We're New York comedy clubs.  Can somebody check if, uh, maybe there's somebody knocking at the door?  Ohp. 
[04:24:00]  And...  Program complete. </pre>
