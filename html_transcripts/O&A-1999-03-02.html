<pre> The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday with Van Halen.  That's pound cake.  We'll send that out to Monica Lewinsky.  Ho ho!  That's Zane Tastrifical.  First funny of the day, everyone.  Ho ho!  Everyone can't wait to see the interview with Barbara Walters tomorrow night.  Yeah.  They just showed a commercial on TV and you see Monica's lips moving and stuff, but I'm  just not hearing what she's saying because you're just thinking everything else.  Yeah, you look at her, you look at her face, which I must say they've done a good job with. 
[00:30]
 Man, they could pretty up anyone on TV, huh?  She kind of looks cute in a chubby chaser kind of way.  Well, she's a slob, but I mean, you know.  Yeah, when you see her in the pictures in the paper where the photographers get her  coming out of a restaurant, which she does a lot of, those pictures don't look half as  good as how they whipped her up for Bab's show.  Yeah.  You do look at those full lips and you're not listening to what's coming out of them, 
[01:00]
 you're thinking about what went in them.  It's true.  So she's got that interview.  Boy, I'm glad I saw the commercial for it.  I might have missed it.  I really haven't heard much about this interview.  Yeah, I don't even know when it's on or anything.  I got in trouble this morning with Jen.  Every morning I wake up and all she hears out of my mouth is negativity.  Negative to everything on the TV.  I'm screaming at the TV, negative, negative, negative. 
[01:30]
 And I'm like, Hey, look at what you're watching.  Rosie, first of all, first Regis and Kathy Lee, then Rosie, and then the view.  So the view, I'm, I literally am like a madman.  I'm screaming at the television.  The view is of late.  The view is now an infomercial for Barbara Walters interview with Monica.  So they all get get on and Barbara's sitting there and they all gush over Barbara.  Barbara, you've done such a wonderful job. 
[02:00]
 This is an exclusive.  It's fabulous.  Oh my God.  Unbelievable.  And she sits there going, well, I don't really want to hype this too much.  But thank you very much.  The hype is getting a widow out of control, but it's very sweet of you.  And they're just, they're just gushing and sucking up.  Oh, oh, like, like, like two dogs that meet on the street.  They got their noses firmly nestled under the tail.  Just snug, the nussling and lapping, lapping her butt. 
[02:30]
 It's just horrible.  And it's so phony.  She wants it hyped.  Then she says on the view this morning, well, it's a fascinating interview.  If it wasn't so fascinating, we probably wouldn't have carried it.  Yeah, right.  Let's just blow off Monica Lewinsky's interview.  You know, they're all a bunch of phony.  So when I start bringing this up and the only person in the house is, you know, Jennifer  and the cats, the cats don't mind my negativity. 
[03:00]
 Jennifer does.  She starts just getting on me about how I'm negative.  You know, that's where you got to call me.  Yeah.  Because I get the same thing going on in my house.  We should have like the bat phone where it just rings in each other's house because we  want to be really negative.  The red phone under that glass dome that you picked up that Alfred used to get.  The negativity phones.  You know, you pick it up.  What?  You see this fat idiot?  Yeah, we need that. 
[03:30]
 We should.  It's horrible.  And then like all the hypocritical crap coming out of people's mouths like Star Jones and  Joy Behar.  Just bull crap.  Just crap.  And I comment on it and Jen calls me negative.  Yeah.  We should get a show on TV for just guys.  Yeah.  A show just like The View but it's a bunch of guys sitting around.  Oh, how fast would that be off the air?  No, it's all fun.  It's fun for them to get on and just man bash. 
[04:00]
 Just man bash.  But could you just picture a bunch of guys sitting around, skull call it like hanging  out or scratching and burping or something.  And you talk about that.  How about, did you get any last night?  Ho ho!  Let me tell you.  I was knee deep in pie last night.  It would be off the air.  We interrupt this program which will no longer be air.  So I'm negative.  I'm sorry but what can I do? 
[04:30]
 I should turn on CNN and watch some Death and Destruction.  It will make me more positive.  Well the problem is though, daytime TV before we come to work revolves around ladies.  Right.  What show do we have to look forward to before we come to work?  Jerry.  Jerry, that's it.  Exactly.  What else do we have though?  You've got the soap operas, you've got Lisa, who cares?  All the cushy little, cushy, wishy, gushy talk shows.  Rosie, Rosie's not made for guys in general.  No.  Oof.  Well I know.  I've seen many guys on the Rosie show. 
[05:00]
 Ever see when she brings her hairdresser up?  Hello!  Woo!  I love when they drag guys out of the audience on the Rosie show.  It's the same thing.  Rosie, I brought you a sweater from our club.  Thank you, thank you very much.  It's wonderful, it's from our club.  It's Fisters, we call it.  You know, and...  Chubby Fisters.  It's the Chubb Club. 
[05:30]
 Very good.  I've cut down on my portion, Rosie, so I'm losing the weight, but I'm not cutting down  on meat.  Oh, we're going to have fun today.  We are just getting warmed up, ladies and gentlemen.  So I'm not negative now, I'm positive.  I'm so positive that I'm negative.  All right, you know the deal.

[07:30]
 Steve Ray Vaughn on the way.  We got a couple from the doors and the black crows by request.  Next, you're hanging with Hope and Anthony.  Hey, we got Alan on the line here.  Alan, what do you got?  Oh, Anthony, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell you guys rule and life is either really good for me.  I'm the luckiest guy in the world or my wife is a space alien.  Why?  What happened?  Let's see.  After buying me a 73 Barracuda, 73 worked Barracuda 340 for wedding present, she informed 
[08:00]
 me tonight, called me today, told me I'm going to become a member of the Tuesday Night Hammer  Club tonight.  All this now, mind you, a week before she's getting her D implants at her request, not  mine.  So I don't know whether to be really happy or like wait and try to pull her face off  while she's sleeping to see the alien underneath.  Davis, this is truly the luckiest man in the world.  I don't know which way to go with this. 
[08:30]
 You're kidding, right?  Plus, she is telling me that I can't retire from playing in my rock band.  She wants me to keep playing.  Oh my God.  Wait, how long have you been married?  We're going on five years.  Oh wow.  She's a man, baby.  You sure she doesn't have a penis?  No, actually she looks like a young Lonnie Anderson without the stupid hair.  All right, so let me get this straight.  She gives you a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  She's got a muscle cramp.  All right, so let me get this straight.  She gives you a muscle cramp as a wedding gift.  Oh, awesome.  You've got to see this thing.  She's inducted you into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club. 
[09:00]
 No, she is tonight.  Okay.  She's getting breast implants in a week.  Yes.  And she wants you to continue playing in your rock band.  Yes.  That says that I'm saying I don't know whether to be ecstatic or worried.  I don't know.  I think she has something to tell you.  I'll tell you guys, you're the best.  You make my drive home from work every day way better than it would have been.  I appreciate it.  And could you guys do me one big favor?  Yeah.  I don't know if you can.  A request.  Hit it.  In lieu of the reunion, could you guys play one Iron Maiden song? 
[09:30]
 Iron Maiden?  Iron Maiden?  Yeah.  One of those.  Back together, Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came back and they're going out on the  road this summer.  What do you want to hear?  Like...  Right to the hills, right to the hills.  Oh, please, not that version, Opie.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  Not that version, Opie.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  I tried to get you guys last Friday to give a big hand.  How about like Number of the Beast or something?  How about like Number of the Beast or something?  Anything.  I was just trying to call you last Friday to give an FU to K-Rock because they always  claim different rock that's on K-Rock.  Meanwhile, they play the lamest garbage in the world.  That's right.  It's on K-Rock. 
[10:00]
 That's what they say.  I was coming home from the Black Crow Show Saturday night.  Yeah.  I was listening to a disco station.  So then I turned it over to Eddie Trunk.  Do you hear what we're doing on Saturday nights?  No.  No, what's that?  Just tuning in.  Trust me.  Saturday nights at what?  10 to 2 a.m.?  Yeah.  Eddie Trunk's on the air just jamming and rocking.  I don't have to listen to that.  It's how the station should sound 24 hours a day, to be honest with you.  In our opinion.  Tell me when they say that.  Like a while back when kids really psyched up, number one request that you make is, do  you have any ideas on how to get rid of the  that stuff. 
[10:30]
 i don't listen to any really radio alright alan you got it 
[11:00]
 and it  uh... you know  is my button pushed his personal son of mine  who keeps pushing that  i don't know we got a bad game button off  did this  this isn't jack that works here that's really pompous and has decided that  uh... only he  should talk to uh... callers because  it's hard explain but it obviously and i are on different microphones and you  have to have these buttons down to talk to the callers so my button isn't down  to call again here me not at all so i'm talking about and i might as well have  my uh... my ass in my mouth so everyday we got to remember to push the button 
[11:30]
 back down  they used to be down all the time but now they're not because someone has  decided that uh...  i don't know had a great little gag about how his wife was calling him about  the threesome  and but jesus i wasn't going to hear it from well maybe he'll call back i'll  screw it i'm disgusted now i feel from saturday i would write so here i sit and  i hear on the radio about this guy who's becoming a member of the tuesday night  hammer club while  typing to you guys my question is what kind of losers online and typing so 
[12:00]
 pete anthony while getting a hammer  i love you guys but not that much  but the  that's pretty good  all right listen how we got the tuesday night hammer club song from uh... steven  lynch that he debuted last week on our show he made a song just for us gas  uh... you want to do that before uh... four o'clock  one oh two seven w a w the raga new york to put his day the rolling stones let it  bleed and she was hot  it's open anthony  and uh... there's some great stuff to talk about 
[12:30]
 uh... you did you hear about the zoo worker who loses finger in chimp attack  yeah that's interesting  we'll get into a little later and then  but i do believe we have uh... the phone number the guy  they lost a finger and a half and part of his nose because it should protect them  in uh... salt lake city  really we're gonna get that person on the line  all my goodness the actual person a little later in the show yes the actual  person  see i wonder who else i'm like i have no idea we love monkey stories on this 
[13:00]
 radio show how any type of chimpanzee story does this crazy and every person in  america's china interview the guy that got injured in the gas attack and i  believe once again will have an exclusive for you to do it  uh... right they would you know we're getting a ton of email  an instant feedback in faxes and stuff  on the uh... playboy pictures of sable  and  uh... i gotta thank uh... shoot i don't have a family i think it's t  t from new jersey  gave us a little heads up 
[13:30]
 and if you go to uh... w w w dot  latest wrestling news  dot com  slash  p w p  you get to see the pictures of sable from uh... w w f naked  they got the playboy pictures i'm surprised i didn't get a  uh... a season is this uh... or from playboy on this one  yeah interesting uh... but if you go there latest wrestling news  all one word no spaces  latest wrestling news dot com slash 
[14:00]
 w p  and then when that uh... pages that is up on your computer the right side you'll  see where it says i say those playboy pics are here  save all your thunder thunder and all that able to look at these pictures  look at these are only got thumbnails now to well you get to see the whole  spread she's got one two three four she's got like twelve pictures in this  playboy issue when does it come out next week some spread  yeah i think that next week 
[14:30]
 well  she looks uh...  you know a lot of girls they take the clothes off and on look is good  she looks pretty good with the clothes off she looks better with her clothes  off  because i was stupid enough say you know what i don't think she's that hot  she shows it all to see is smoking she's revealing the uh... thatch yes you that  that's a kind of an interesting pattern is that yes is doing something a little  wacky there  and so it's a very long  exclamation point against landing strip 
[15:00]
 it  at the pleasure airport  yeah  that's a huge exclamation point that's what it is now it is a little thicker up here  that kind of narrows out  to the four pictures kind of at the bottom the end of which is on all all  fours the up  getting that who faces that the who  fail  if you listen to our show on a regular basis and you know that we'd like to talk  about uh... the w w f we just love wrestling we think it's hysterical 
[15:30]
 finance goofy it's uh...  and we found out that uh... you know stable was going to be a playboy  and we wanted her to  be on our show desperately i mean desperately we tried everything we called  her people and actually got in touch rick gotten touch with uh... stable  producer  and uh... booker for our show it was booked  she was booked rey rick for what dot this thursday  yes she was booked for thursday afternoon and then all of a sudden about 
[16:00]
 say an hour later  i got a call back from the playboys people and they said  that uh... we're not allowed to have her  on thursday afternoon  and i wonder why  i wonder why  let's get right to it  howard stern  howard stern because it was going to be on howard show friday he demanded that  she she does no other show before his yet  it's kind of funny because howard has told all his listeners that we only have  three listeners yes so what's the big deal what would be the big deal she was  on our show thursday before uh... she was on his show this this friday morning 
[16:30]
 that doesn't sound like uh... something he do playing hardball with guests does  it  that sounds like something if you watched uh... the movie private parts that  like mister amiss would do  and  c had you got to be more like mister and  you know that seems something like more like i miss would do to the howard of  the movie here then howard would do to it  up-and-coming struggling radio show 
[17:00]
 that isn't even competing in the same time  plus he said it you know we're saying he said that we only have three listeners  what's the deal  why can't we have stable known would hear our interview with her right  the i think the three people listening would enjoy it and then  he can have it but i guess i don't turn  bosses on this one  done stern  hold your guests in your pockets like so many nickels and dimes  done stern you must let us all draw from the well 
[17:30]
 if we are to survive  we cannot  face a war we cannot go to the mattresses  you must let us draw from the well done stern  the well of guests  that you hold in your pockets  like so many nickels and dimes please done stern allow us  and who draw from this well  so me way we may enhance  our show  that done stern we ask you  this favor 
[18:00]
 may we please have stable on our show  done stern  you are powerful done stern in new york city  you are the head  of the most powerful radio family  that in new york city  so done stern we come to you asking  for a piece some of your guests done stern must you keep them from us  we struggle  we are trying to make a foothold here  if you could please done stern allow us 
[18:30]
 this one favor  and we may someday repay you with a favor  done stern  unfortunately like luca bronce on this one and we'll be swimming with the  fishes and have the piano wire around our neck  and you know so it would have died if uh...  if you had easy pass  if only my boy had easy pass  look how they massacred my boy at the toll booth 
[19:00]
 can you see like the hit squad waiting at the side  sonny just ding the gate goes up and drives through  son of a big  that's a great and freezing that it's a red  sunny calling on  there is a sound  the clip from the movie  so please done stern  you must allow us to draw from the well  that's not going to happen obviously but i think that's able we wanted stable we 
[19:30]
 had a book and uh... and we got a really played hardball yet knowing i guess they  you know they need the ratings over there more than we do but i guess for now  i can't even say that was a great thing  i guess for now we gotta start talking about the w c w and and the easy w  screwed w w f  right now i don't know if it's their fault hoping  i'll have to be their fault  and my way boys carter around  well if you want to check out the pictures for free

 good. If you're going to be around, if you haven't heard the Reverend Al Sharpton song  yet, oh, trust me, you want to hear it. It's a nice little ditty. You might want to dance  to it. You think? Yeah, I think so. It's an up tune. It's happy and fun. All right.  Still to come, we've got some Metallica. We'll do some U2 next. We've got some Zeppelin by  request. Some great rock and roll today, man. Floyd's on the way. ACDC. House and Chain.  Some Bowie. Rock. Allman Brothers. Cool. What happened today, man? And also a great story 
[32:30]
 about a chimpanzee attacking a zoo worker. And we love stories about monkeys. Yes. And  I guess we're going to get the guy that got attacked by the chimpanzees out there. Where?  Utah or something like that? Yeah. I think it was Utah. I'm trying to find the story  here. We're going to get him on the phone and see what the hell happened and why the  chimpanzees attacked the guy. Yeah, I get his side of the story. All right. So everyone 
[33:00]
 wants to talk to this guy and we'll have an exclusive. We'll have him on the air next.  All right. All right. Sure. Sure. It's him. And keep the instant feedback coming. Of America.  1027 WNEW. The Rock of New York. Two for Tuesday. U2. Bullet the Blue Sky from the Joshua Tree.  And New Year's Day from War, of course. Hopi and Anthony on the way. We've got Metallica.  And we got Zeppelin X. We'll be getting the lead out next, Anthony. What? No, I can't wait. 
[33:30]
 I'm sorry, but I'll stick around for that.  I guess if there's nothing else to do on your show, saying get the lead out is an exciting  thing to do. All right. I'm going to eat cricket. Dan, I got the hiccups. All right. Great story 
[34:00]
 of the paper today. I got the hiccups really bad. I'm never going to get through this.  This will be it. Look at you. You have the hiccups. You know how to cure that? How?  You got to drink water through a napkin out of a glass. Shut up. 
[34:30]
 You do. It's a breath control thing. Everyone has their cure for hiccups. None of them work.  I don't need the napkin anymore. You know what you got to do? Look. Take small sips of water  and swallow and alternatingly breathe in and out at erratic. What are you doing?  No, you're doing it too fast. You got to swallow. Breathe out real hard. Swallow a little more than  breathing like halfway. Screw it. We got a great story. That you're never going to get through. 
[35:00]
 Rick, take your water. I'm going to help you out here. Everyone has their cure for this stuff.  Never works. Go. Put your mouth around it. Not the way you normally drink it. The other way.  Come fully covering. And then you suck down. Oh, when? Are we going to take pictures for  a candid camera or something? No. It's just so we can put your...  We took all candid cameras. Watch the fun as Opie looks like he's doing fellatio on a bottle  of Nye and water. As Fanny Flair gives him instructions as if to rid him of hiccups. 
[35:30]
 And Maury Amsterdam playing the bumbling police officer.  I think you forgot about them. All right. I think they're better. All right. Great story.  The paper headline reads zoo worker loses finger and chimp attack.  Ouch. It looks so cuddly and cute. Salt Lake City. A zoo worker lost a finger and part of his nose 
[36:00]
 when an escaped chimpanzee attacked him and another employee. Zoo officials killed the  chimp and one of his companions. Male chimps Chip and Happy and female Tammy escaped from  their cage Saturday and ran into a service area where Chip attacked the man. The man lost one  finger, part of another finger and part of his nose and suffered bites and scratches. Kim, the  zoo's new primate supervisor threw herself on the man and suffered cuts and scrapes during the attack. 
[36:30]
 Other employees fired shotguns at Chip and Happy who charged at a worker. Both chimps were  euthanized said zoo spokespeople. Euthanized with the shotgun probably. Well, yeah, they killed one  of them. So I believe we have such a budget on this radio show. We flew in the guy that lost a  finger and a half and part of his nose. Anthony, I'm thrilled. I can't wait to speak to him. So if  Mark will open the door behind him, we will let the man in and see who the man is. Here he comes 
[37:00]
 down the hall now. He looks pretty banged up. He's all wrapped up and bandaged. Here he comes  through the doorway. Don't touch my nose, you buffoon. Look at me. Look at what's happening. 
[37:30]
 You bit off my nose, you bloody baboon. How could this have happened? I'm a mess. Damn.  You're really a mess. Now, why would the chimpanzees attack you, Mr. Haston?  I don't have a clue. I was at the zoo. Yeah. I went to feed him. Yeah. And all of a sudden,  Happy attacked me. I had monkey bite marks all over my fingers. 
[38:00]
 God, give me back my finger, you damn dirty ape. Now, wait, wait, wait, wait. You were just feeding  the monkeys. I was petting the little chimp. All right. You were so cute and cuddly. You had to  do something. You had to have done something to have the monkeys attacking you. It was nothing.  I was beating them. It was lovely. A tender moment, me and a monkey. All of a sudden,  they lost it. I wasn't doing anything wrong. You must have been doing something wrong. What 
[38:30]
 are you getting at? They really lost it. I don't understand. Were you in the cage with the monkeys,  Mr. Haston? All right. You got me. I was trying to partake in the delicacy that is monkey meat.  Damn me to hell. How was I to know that lovely little chimps would not be receptive to me touching  that red ass, that gorgeous red monkey ass? It's a madhouse, a madhouse. 
[39:00]
 I should have stopped when it started throwing feces at me. I was commenting  and yearning for the taste of forbidden monkey meat. All of a sudden, I reached up,  grabbed some of that supple red soft monkey ass, and they went crazy, biting my nose off. 
[39:30]
 Damn me. I can't believe it. I even taught it to smile. Nova. Nova. The other one got mad  because I told it, man was here first. You owe him your science, your civilization, whatever you've  got. And it ran after me, biting off two fingers and a piece of the chocked and hastened nose. 
[40:00]
 How can I ever do another movie without a nose? I think they were hungry and they were attacking  that creature that lives on the top of your head. Do you think that was it? I've read a lot about  chimps. Maybe they thought the fuzzy thing on my head that I call a toupee was the alpha male.  Drank the honing on its territory. I didn't even think of it. It does look like a chimp on my head,  doesn't it? It sure does. It looks just like Dr. Zayas on my head, that kind of silvery color, 
[40:30]
 just like Zayas. Damn me. Why did I have to have taken monkey meat? The Ten Commandments said  nothing about coveting monkey meat. I figured it was fair game till they laid their chimpanzee teeth  into my nose. Well, now I know. They were to stick my nose where it doesn't belong.  You know why they bit my nose, don't you? No, why? Because it smelled like monkey meat. 
[41:00]
 I shouldn't stick the charting nose where it doesn't belong. It's a good thing I hadn't taken  off my loin cloth. She might have gotten a hold of my charting chew, as I like to call it,  my sweet candy bar that is the charting chew. Damn me. Ouch. Can you leave now? Yes. Where's 
[41:30]
 my chariot? Damn me. Why did I put Jake in the monkey meat? There he goes. He's on his chariot.  He's all bandaged up. There he goes. Mr. Heston, everyone. I didn't know it was Chuck Heston. You  think they would have put that in the paper? It's kind of strange. Every time there's a story  about a monkey in the paper, Charlton Heston has something to do with it. Yeah. How about that?  Very strange. Is it a coincidence? 
[42:00]
 Sable booked. We talk about wrestling all the time. And, well, they came back to us and said,  oh no, oh no, Sable will not be on your show because Howard told us that she can't appear on  any other show before his. And conveniently enough, she's got to fly back to wherever she's from  Friday after Howard's show. So only Howard will be talking to Sable. You know, I don't get it.  I remember many years ago, I would listen to Howard being from Long Island and hear him 
[42:30]
 bitching and complaining about people, you know, they can't come on my show, Robin,  because then they'd be banned from another show. You know? Yeah. But now he's pulling the same  hardball stuff. Of course he is. And they say we only have three listeners. So what's the big deal  if Sable comes on here? Obviously they knew that she was booked on our show. Yeah. And, you know,  Howard was the one who went on his show and said that we only had three listeners. So what's the  big deal if Sable's on our show for three listeners? And we watched the wrestling show. We watched 
[43:00]
 WWF. And I would like to ask her some questions about the behind the scenes stuff because we know  it. I mean, not just, you know, wow, look at the cans on you. How about those, Robin? Huh? Hey,  Jackie, you like a piece of that, huh? Wouldn't you? Hey, those are nice cans. Don't forget the  lesbian questions. Yeah. There's got to be at least 10 in every interview. 
[43:30]
 And what goes on backstage with the lesbians? I like that, honey. Oh, you're hot, honey.  I'm robbing you of those cans like that. You got to cut off. Right, Jackie?  So we're a little bummed today about that. But anyway, we want to turn our listeners onto  the pictures of Sable naked. My wife just died, you know. 
[44:00]
 Like a piece of you, honey. So when does the Playboy issue come out next week?  Yeah. I think next week. So we want all our listeners to check out the pictures for free.  Yeah. Screw. Now we're mad. Screw buying Playboy when you can get him for free right now.  Oh, that's a Howard thing. Sorry. Look, he's whipping me off. He's burping on the air.  Sorry about that, Howard. I forgot only you're allowed to burp and fart on the air. 
[44:30]
 Anyway, yeah, we want to turn on all our listeners onto the pictures of Sable for free. The key word  here is free, free, free. Screw Sable. Screw the WWF. And the website is www.latestwrestlingnews.com.  One word all put together. Latest Wrestling News. No spaces,  nothing. Latest Wrestling News dot com slash PWP. That's it. And you'll get to see the pictures 
[45:00]
 of Sable and Playboy for free. For free, free, free. Okay. Right. And we got that address here  at the studio if you want to call Rick up or something. All right. Once again, the www.latest  wrestling news. All one word, no spaces dot com slash PWP. All right. Good. A lot of people on  the answer feedback commenting about the pictures. Yeah, they're just, they're smoking pretty hot.  Real hot. So it would have been nice to us to see her live on our show. Let's get back into the tunes. 
[45:30]
 Yeah. Yeah.  What are we going to give away that trip to see Metallica on the West coast?  We have details on that yet? No, none that I know. All right. I hate when people talk over the  beginning of this. It's a build. You got to, you got to let it build. Yeah. Don't start over.  Cause you're in your car. You're just, and then you're like, and then you're like, shut up.  Say your prayer. Don't forget my son. Do it to everyone. 
[46:00]
 You just, you got it.  One oh two seven. WNEW the rock of New York. Two for Tuesday, Metallica, whiskey in the jar  from garage. And Anderson, man, from one of the best albums of the nineties, the black album.  When did that come out? Did that come out like 1990 or so? I'm trying to remember now.  91, 92 ish. Was it 90? You look at the album and you say, how much more black could this be? 
[46:30]
 And the answer is none. None more black. I just love the idea that they took it from Spinal Tap.  The black album. Here it is. Smell the glove. God, one of my favorite movies. I haven't seen  that in a while. This is Spinal Tap. It's time for another showing, I believe. Yes. Definitely a  favorite. Now we stayed in the same hotel as a lot of that movie was filmed at. Well, at the hotel,  whatever this twisted old fruit. I'm just as God made me. God, it's a funny movie. 
[47:00]
 We should have a showing. We should get all our listeners together and just show movies like that.  We could show like The Other Sister and Spinal Tap. That'd be a great double feature. We should do  that. Have like movie night. Movie night. We'll play like Fast Times at Richmond High and stupid  movies that we like. Yeah, there you go. Caddy Shack. Chance to see Metallica on the West Coast.  Yeah. Details to come, I guess. One of these days. One of these days. 
[47:30]
 Well, we're talking about the Stones thing this week. Yeah. Sending a busload of people to see  the Stones in Hartford. I keep listening for details on that. That's very cool.  We've all heard the Beverly Hills Billy's promo by now. Oh, really?  A thousand times. It was a cute promo the first hundred times.  I've heard it. You know how radio is up. You've got to push these things.  Yes, you do. Yeah. All right. Let's take a look at instant feedback here. What do we got?  Andy from Jersey. Hey, Oppenac. Regarding the opening of the Egyptian tomb, I agree. 
[48:00]
 Who ever picked Maury Povich for that? What? I agree. Who picked Maury Povich for that?  I guess it could be worse. Could be Jerry Springer. How about Dice Man or Yoshi?  You guys are pretty funny. Thanks for the laugh, Andy.  Look at this all dried up skib. There's a mummy in here. What is this? A mummy?  Look at it look like some broads I had. I don't think Dice would have worked. But Maury,  I mean, it just degrades the whole thing that it sat there 5,000 years sealed. 
[48:30]
 And Maury Povich and the Fox TV crew are going in there. They're opening it up tonight at eight.  And probably finding nothing. Nothing like Al Capone's vault.  Well, thank God we'll be commuting at this point. You think he's going to do this? You  think Maury's going to just have the wacky Indiana Jones hat and the leather jacket and the bullwhip  and just go around like, you know, maybe they'll do like a little vignette of him walking down the 
[49:00]
 corridors of the Egyptian pyramid. I'm Indiana Povich. The walls are as dry as Connie's womb.  Look at this. Skeletons in here just like Connie's womb.  Raiders of the Lost Crotch.  Hey Connie, we found your ovaries in here. They're mummified. Look at them wrapped up.  Connie's womb. Don't look at it. Don't look at it. Close your eyes. 
[49:30]
 Nice. Womb Raider 3. New game for PlayStation. I bet he's going to do some stupid things.  It might be booby trapped. I need the little sack of sand and then I'll tip it on and grab the head  and run out. Oh look how giant Boulder's getting me. Oh no, run.  You think? I think so. I think he'll be that corny. It's going to be pretty stupid tonight. 
[50:00]
 Look at that. It's like the last time I was near Connie's womb. Snakes. I hate snakes. Look at that.  Oh brother. Short round. You go in first.  Let me let me get my machete. Let me hack through this batch covering.  My god, what is that? This fallopian tube hasn't been used in years. 
[50:30]
 Fossilized. Indiana Povich. Womb Raider 3.  Dr. Povich, that womb has been dead for years.  I bet you watch it tonight. Yeah. I bet he does some dopey Indiana Jones thing. A silly little angle. 
[51:00]
 Indiana Povich. My bullwhip. Let me wrap it around this ovary.  I'll swing across the womb.  Oh, we can't wait to watch tonight. Oh, it's closing.  Oh, I just grabbed my hat in time before it slammed shut. 
[51:30]
 Oh brother, Maury. All right. Eight o'clock tonight on Fox, right? Yeah.  They're advertising it as the Super Bowl of archaeology.  Oh, whoopee. Let's have a party. Crack open some beers.  This is with science made sexy by music, high tech camera work and speculation about deadly  curses and pyramid power. Yeah, they're going to make it like this music video looking format.  Really? Is what they're going to do. They're going to Fox it up, you know? 
[52:00]
 I'm going to have John Madden with his illustrator. Here he goes down the corridor. He's going to turn  right here. Bam. All right. There you have it. I'll watch it. Oh, I got suckered into the  Geraldo Al Capone's wall thing. So I'll get suckered into this one. Yeah. Hopefully there's  something in this thing. What time is it on? We're not going to watch it. We'll be driving home.  Eight tonight. Jan, tape that for me. Would you please? San tape that for us. All right. 
[52:30]
 Everyone is standing by. They want to hear the Reverend Al Sharpton song. Yes. Yes. Very popular  song. And I will promise that we will play it after a twofer from ACDC. So get your tape  re tape decks ready. Yes. Because I don't know how many more plays we could get out of this.  What is going on with the second ACDC song? Let's try that again. 
[53:00]
 For a fresh second opinion and free video tape, call us at Staten Island University Hospital  1-800-285-4584. 1-800-285-4584.  We got reprimanded for that bit yesterday. Well,  come on. You got to admit. I mean, the guy probably might not appreciate that. True.  He did yesterday. I'm sure it's a wonderful place to get help. Yeah, I guess. But it's just the, 
[53:30]
 I don't know, the delivery needs a little boost. Just a little bit.  Stereotactic surgery for treatment of metastasis in the neck, head.  You want to party? Kegger treating cannolis of the feet, butt, back, legs, arms.  Stereotactic radio surgery for cappuccino of the leg, elbow, 
[54:00]
 click clacks of the neck, chest, heart. Stop. We're going to get in trouble again.  Radioactive seed implantment for Saskatchewan of the legs, cheek, feet, and ass. Sorry.  Just every time I'm in the car and I hear that, it's, oof, it'll taste real. 
[54:30]
 Stereotactic radio surgery, cocumonga of the intestine, stomach.  They begged us to stop on that one. Okay, I'm sorry. All right. Let's get back to the  tunes. It's safer that way. The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Two for Tuesday,  Alice in Chains. That's Wood from the Dirt CD. That felt good. Ain't that nice? And no excuses 
[55:00]
 before that. If we could play Wood, we got to start playing Man in the Box. Simple as that.  Yeah. I love that. We should make it into a threefer. Wow, threefer. Should we break the  Two for Tuesday rule and throw in a third song from Alice in Chains? Three for Thursday.  Four for Friday. We're doing a fourfer of Leonard Skinner. We'll see you next week.  So what's going on with Alice in Chains? I don't know. You know, Lane has his drug problems open. 
[55:30]
 As we all know. It's so funny because everyone has the rumors about Lane Staley.  Yeah. They're like, dude, my friend, he was in Seattle and he saw Lane in a gutter. Dude,  he's down to like 70 pounds, man. He had needles just hanging out of his arms, man. It was sick.  I don't think he's going to make it to April, dude. Everyone has their Lane Staley sightings.  Now from what I heard, they're in the studio. Come on. That's what I heard. Cut it out. Read  it in the Rolling Stone. It must be another album. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
[56:00]
 Read, um, recording another album. What are you reading?  Never. Share it with the entire listening audience. Opie. I don't get it though. O and A. What  happened to Chuck's trigger finger? Oh, oh, okay. He lost a finger in a chimp attack.  When chimps attack. Fox. He talked about that earlier. Okay. Optional equipment to receive 
[56:30]
 Hummer lobster bib and knee pads. You guys three to seven, Monday to Friday has never been this  good. Screw Howard. Both of his shows suck. JV not too far upstate. There you go. I share it.  There wasn't much there. All right. I'm sorry. All right. Um, this is an interesting story.  Battle of the talk show host, Anthony Oprah and Roseanne will arm wrestle.  Wow. I guess they arm wrestled today. Did they? Was it Oprah on Roseanne today? I think so. Yeah. 
[57:00]
 All right. Los Angeles on the view too. I think talking about how if she's going to stay on  television or not. Who were the big question? Oprah. Yeah. She'll stay. Who cares? Of course  she'll stay. What else is she going to do? Talk show hosts, Oprah Winfrey and Roseanne,  usually just battle over ratings, but they're about to battle over each other's muscles.  A spokesperson for the Roseanne show says the two superstars actually engage in an arm wrestling 
[57:30]
 match while Roseanne was interviewing Oprah for an episode of her talk show that aired today.  They were, they were arm wrestling. Who wants to see that big sweaty cafeteria lady arms  with the flat, flabby flesh hanging from the bottom.  Come on. Oh my God. My hand. Just sweating armpit sweat grunting. 
[58:00]
 Don't get the wrong idea. The cat.  Hey, Oprah popped a nugget.  Don't get the wrong idea. The cat fight was a good natured rivalry spurred on by feisty Roseanne  with the loser donating $10,000 to the winner's favorite charity. Anthony, for the record,  buffed out Oprah slammed Roseanne's mitt to the mat in two of three matches,  which means Oprah's angel network charity is now $10,000 richer.  Isn't that cute? That's stupid. I'd rather see them compare like balloon knots. 
[58:30]
 Oh, I like big. Yeah, let's see that balloon. Not baby.  Hey, if you ever saw one of their balloon knots, yeah, you would, it would be like looking at,  you turned to stone. 
[59:00]
 Like looking at Medusa. It just turns us a stone.  Big.  Remember this video. Yeah.  One more time. One more time. Come on.  All right. Cute little sound effect. Thanks, Rick.  You don't want to see them balloon knots. No. All right. 
[59:30]
 Well, good luck to you. Do they have another, um, uh, UFO show on tonight?  Well, it's a what? Invasion week on, um, just discovery.  It's still alien and they'll say on the learning channel. Those shows are great.  I saw the, uh, one with the guy who just so happened to have a camcorder with him. Every  time a UFO showed up over his house. Oh, but how many UFOs have you ever seen in your life?  Well, Anthony, um, I've seen none. None. What a coincidence. Cause I've seen just about, oh,  none. And, uh, how many, how many you see? I've seen none. None. And this guy is on his rooftop 
[60:00]
 with a camera. He's, you should have seen the show. So I was up on me rooftop. I had me camera  and all of a sudden I see a flash of light in the sky. So I'm typing it and it's a flying saucer.  So like about a week later, I'm on the roof again with me camera and I'll see a cigar  shaped object come over the house. So I'm typing another UFO eight times. This guy just 
[60:30]
 bit happened to be walking with his camera and get a UFO. So they went to a place to see if it  was legit. And it turns out one of the videos he taped off a television screen and the guy's like,  well, this seems to be taped off a TV. I could tell by the smarking on the, well, right, right.  What happened was the original got like, um, chewed in the VCR. So I had to like tape it off the  telly and all of a sudden the type exploded some kind of a UFO thing. It is just babbling 
[61:00]
 and it wasn't making sense. He was full of it, but I love the UFO shows of course, but I want some  real clear video because the clear videos they do show it's a hubcap on our string. Yeah. It's like,  oh, look how clear a hubcap. Oh, we need to bring a, a Nimoy back. Yeah. Yeah. Those are great.  So what was the show called in search of right in search of, oh, strange in search of the luckness  monster. And you'd lit the end of the show. It was like, oh, he didn't show me anything. Right. 
[61:30]
 He didn't learn anything new in search of Sasquatch, big foot. And they'd show that  dopey footage of the guy that fell off the horse. And you see this guy in a monkey suit  walking through the woods. That was the best footage when we were growing up though.  And they always froze it right when he turned his head and looked at the camera. Yeah. Ooh,  killing the guy was in search of big foot for all those years. He finally gets his shot and he falls  off the horse falls off the horse. And then does he run after big foot taping? No, he sat there  while big foot turned, looked at him and walked away at a leisurely pace. Yeah. He could have ran 
[62:00]
 after him. Haven't they proven that's a fake now? That's what they say. They say it was a guy in a  suit and the Loch Ness monster, the famous photograph of it. That really bummed me out.  They finally said that the guy who took the footage of the Loch Ness where you see the head  in the distance just going across the lake. Yeah. When the guy was dying on his deathbed,  he admitted that it was a phony. It was fake. It was a piece of wood. I was such a bummer.  I strapped a piece of wood to me blokes back and we filmed it. Yeah. It's a fake.  It's like all bum because as a kid, you always wanted to believe in it. True. Yeah. 
[62:30]
 Alley and invasion week learning channel. I think I'm watching that tonight. Yeah,  that's a good one. All right. What do we got? We got a couple from David Bowie left and  not many factors today. No, huh? 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York,  two per Tuesday, David Bowie, DJ. That was one of the first MTV videos. Yeah. If you  remember correctly, right? In the lineup of the five that they used to play. I think they played 
[63:00]
 about 10. They played 10 and then showed a picture of the Apollo rocket taking off.  And that would just bloom and then they'd start back over at, you know,  Blue West, the cult burning for you. Yeah, it was burning for you.  Running with the shadows of the night. No, that was later. That was later. That was when  they really started getting production. I remember. All right. Name some of the airplanes.  Some of the first videos that now you're putting me on the spot. Video kill the radio star, 
[63:30]
 the the boggles. Yeah. Yeah. Um, uh, a flock of seagulls flock of seagulls. I ran that had to be  one of the first ones with the great use of tin foil on the camera so you couldn't see it in the  mirror. Yeah, that works real well. I think chill. A wax gone, gone, gone. I've been gone  so long. Yeah, gone, gone, gone so long. No, no, no. That was one of the first ones.  Old triumph of Billy Squire. Oh yeah. Billy Squire. Definitely. Which Billy Squire song though? 
[64:00]
 I know Christmas time was the Christmas one. No, that was all right. Hold on. Now we got to go  to the phones. Yeah. Hi. Any W. Any W. Hi. Turn down your radio. You're live on the air. We're on  delay. Oh, she doesn't know. She said screw you. Well, did she say screw? No. Hi. Any W.  Any W. All right. This is really working out again today. Great. Oh, there they go. Now they're  popping. Hi. Any W. Hey, what's up? Hey, speak into your phone, not to your radio. All right. 
[64:30]
 Hold on. Hi. Any W. Yeah. They hungry like the wolf about a billion times. That's right.  Yeah. But that was also when they started getting production value. Yeah. Yeah. We're talking to  the ones that they just had laying around when MTV first started. Break my drive maybe by a while.  No, that was later too. That was definitely later. Anything that looked like it cost more  than 10 bucks. I think the Buggles, Burning for You, Blue Oyster Cult. Thanks, man. Okay. 
[65:00]
 Hi. Any W. Yeah. Hey. How you doing? All right. What's up? I think you guys should have a big  party on the lawn in Central Park. I think that'll do a lot for their listener base.  So can I talk to them? I have a great idea. Seriously, because they were talking about how  they can get the word out. And I think that if we can get, you know, if they can telecast live  for Central Park on the lawn, you know, on a nice day in April. Well, you want to talk to  Hope and Anthony? Yeah. Because I think it's a really good idea. I don't know, man. They don't  really like talking to listeners at all. Oh, well, you know, I've kind of gathered that. But 
[65:30]
 I mean, you know, they sound really cool in the air and stuff, but they're real pricks off mic.  All right. Why don't you pass along a suggestion to them? Okay. Because I think it's a pretty good  suggestion. I think that I don't even know if they want to acknowledge any suggestions from  their listeners. Oh, it's okay. They don't have to acknowledge it, but I think it's a great idea.  I think you guys should have a party. You know what you should do? You know that normal day where  everybody smokes Doobies? Yeah. You know, what you should do is you should move that over to the park  there and they can figure out how to telecast in the park live on that day. You want me to pass 
[66:00]
 this on to Hope and Anthony? I think it'll be a great idea. I'm just producing the show, man.  I'm kind of scared of them. Well, I mean, off mic, to be honest with you, they say they don't  really care about their listeners. But you know what? You got to give them a little room here.  You know, if you're producing the show, you got to understand that you got to give them some more  room here because you should let them do the Grease Man, you know. So the Grease Man was a good  routine. Why don't you guys let them do the Grease Man? Well, I'm not in charge. I'm just in college.  I just answer the phones, man. Yeah, no, but whoever's running things over there, you should  tell this guy to let them do the Grease Man because, you know, the Grease Man was pretty funny stuff, 
[66:30]
 you know? And I mean, you know, they shouldn't have pulled the police. All right. All right.  So what's your message to Opie and Anthony? Oh, rock on. They should party from the lawn  in Central Park. All right. Well, you want to hold on for Opie and Anthony? Oh, if they want  to talk to me, yeah, sure. I'm sure they don't want to, but, you know, maybe you'll get them in  a good mood. It's rare. Yeah, well, you know, there's ratings. The ratings are low, so it's  not terrible. I think Opie's in a good mood for two minutes a day, so he might luck out.  Well, you might see he went to the Black Crowes concert, so that's going to wear off pretty soon. 
[67:00]
 And Anthony's too busy, you know, practicing. Impressions, yeah. Impressions. No, he does.  It's so stupid. Like when the music's playing, he goes in the bathroom and like tries out his  voices in front of the mirror to see how he looks. You know, how easy? How long do you practice those  things for? For hours. I mean, we can't even get him in the studio. We can't even talk to him.  He's just like, when the music's playing, he goes into the bathroom with his big head and just like  stares at himself in the mirror. And he honestly thinks he's like Charlton Heston when he's doing  the voice and stuff. He's got some good impressions though, you have to admit. I'll tell you. 
[67:30]
 This is Johnny B.  Oh, Johnny B. Yeah, you got it, John. What are you saying?  Well, I do a radio show at my college station. I call myself Johnny B. Good.  Right.  So I'm trying to break in, so I'm here, but these guys are a bunch of losers, man. I tell you.  I should like write a tell-all book.  What radio station? What college radio station?  Huh?  What college radio station?  NYU.  NYU?  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty good. That's not bad. You've got some good company over there. Smart people over there.  Yeah. And Opie's so paranoid in between songs. He's like, you know, blowing 
[68:00]
 lines and stuff in the bathroom.  Well, you know what? I really need a publisher to listen to me because I could really write a  great book about these guys. I've been with them for like nine months now.  Well, you know what? I'll tell you something, Mark. They hit the nail on the head just yesterday.  They have a really intelligent sense of humor. They were right. They could spin records and  that would make things really easy and you can't get into too much trouble spinning records.  But these guys, you know-  I'll tell you the truth though, because they talk about it all the time when the music's playing.  They rip off everything from Howard. They just don't want to go on the air and say that. 
[68:30]
 Well, you know, no one's inventing the wheel again, but let me tell you something. The  difference between them and Howard is Howard was always talking about lesbians or things like that.  What really makes them good is that these guys, they take everyday events.  I'll tell you what was creative genius, okay? Taking that thing with Mary Julianne and the cause  and doing the author impression. Howard, on his best day, couldn't come up with anything like that.  And if you compare Carol, was that her name, the sidekick? 
[69:00]
 Carol?  No, the fat girl, Robin.  Oh, Robin, yeah.  Right, Robin Quivers. If you compare her to Opie, oh forget about it. I think at best,  I'll tell you, I think at best Howard gets a dead even with Anthony. I mean, I give you  H.D. to Anthony because he does impressions. And Howard, again, all he does is talk about  penises and lesbians and everybody's like, oh, that's so funny. But I've told him my  work here that Opie and Anthony, they got real sense of humor. These guys are really  intelligent humor. And you know, I mean-  You should see them though, man. Right now they're like, they're just cowering in the 
[69:30]
 corner. They're scared to go back on the air. I swear, did you see that the scene from,  what was the movie? Big Chill? We climbed close in the shower. That's what Opie does while the  songs are playing.  Well, I don't think we've got that bad.  I swear to God, he can't handle it, you know?  Well, you know, it's a lot of pressure being funny every day.  I know it's bizarre, you know, how Anthony was in the paper for being a racist and stuff.  Yeah.  On what? Sunday?  Yeah.  And he was trying to defend himself yesterday?  What paper was that?  It was Daily News, a big article in the Sunday paper. Anthony in real life's a chink. 
[70:00]
 Is that right?  I swear to you.  I do pictures. I don't say-  It's so funny because like he walks in and he acts like he's Italian and stuff.  He's really Yoshi. In real life he's Yoshi. When he comes out to the radio station, he's Anthony.  Exactly. These guys are a bunch of scumbags.  It must be fun working with these guys.  Not really. They don't even acknowledge me. So that's why I don't mind talking crap about it.  No, but come on. You must get to really hang out a lot and have some good times. 
[70:30]
 Oh yeah, it's great to run upstairs and get them coffee and stuff.  Oh come on. Yeah, come on. Deep down. It's a fun job, right?  I haven't learned anything from them.  Swear to you.  You learned that I take a lot of abuse though and that's the first rule of radio.  No, they don't even acknowledge me. I mean, I wish they would drag me in here and just abuse me,  you know, but they don't even do that.  Well, you know, if Black girl gets tired of getting whipped, you can be next.  Black girl. That's another joke. The guy's white.  No, I met Black girl. I met Black girl at the Black Crows at the Irving Plaza. 
[71:00]
 Black girl was cool. Those were those guys. They were hanging out in front of him and his  tall guy. I guess it was Ben. But yeah, they all seemed like they were having a good time,  you know, goofing and then you go in and see the show. I mean, you must get to see some  shows with them at least. You know, they showed you cops some good tickets to the Crows, didn't you?  No, I was the guy giving out bumper stickers after the show.  Come on, you got to see the show. They got you in. Tell the truth. They got you in, right?  Well, they got me tickets. I got to see Hanson a couple of months ago. 
[71:30]
 Got to be some perks, right?  Yeah.  Are you guys going to be giving out tickets for Jeff Beck? I haven't heard anything about that  and that's a really good show.  Jeff Beck's still alive?  Yeah, he's playing on the 19th. He's playing on the 19th at the...  Roseland.  Yeah, Roseland. Right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a judge. I'll tell you, you know.  All right, well, listen, we got to wrap this up. I mean, you got a message for those  scumbags?  Yeah, tell them what they should do is they should tap into the normal crowd.  All right, hold on. I'll let you talk to them. Hold on.  Thanks, Lon.  I think Anthony is done with his stupid impressions coming back in the studio. Hold on. 
[72:00]
 N-E-W.  Yeah, what's up? How you doing? Who's this?  Hey, this is Opie and Anthony. What's up?  Opie, Anthony. How you doing?  How you doing?  All right, guys. Good to talk to you guys. You guys are very funny. I want to tell everybody  about your show.  Are you sitting on hold that long?  Yeah, my goal is to tell one new person every day about your show.  Hey, hey, you know, we just got this new intern, you know?  Is that Johnny B.?  Yeah, Johnny B.  Oh, Johnny B.  Did he treat you well on the phones and stuff?  Yeah, Johnny was talking a lot of good stuff. 
[72:30]
 Oh, really?  Yeah, he was talking about you guys saying good things about you guys.  Oh, really?  Okay, cool.  Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing then?  Not because he just, he made it seem like you guys are having a good time over there.  No, because we're hearing a couple of things.  No, we're serious because we've had some complaints from the listeners and we really need to know the truth.  Was he cool to you and stuff?  No, he was cool and you guys got some good help over there. I met Black Girl. Black Girl is a good guy.  I met him outside the Crow's.  Well, we had a couple of people actually email and fax that said that Johnny B. kind of rips us new a-holes when we're not in the studio and we want to get to the bottom of it. 
[73:00]
 No, you know what it is? I was telling him that you guys got a brain which puts you a couple steps ahead of Howard.  Well, what did Johnny B. say? We walked in and he sounded like he was saying something and then just stopped talking.  No, he was just telling me how hard you work at your impressions.  Really?  Yeah, he said you're always trying to perfect your impressions and do better.  Oh, is that it? Wow, how about that? Well, that's pretty cool.  He said whenever you're not in the air, you're practicing. 
[73:30]
 Wait, wait, wait. You just cursed, man.  You just cursed.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, sure you did.  You said the S word.  He doesn't curse when he's talking to Johnny B.  All right, listen, we're going to put you on hold, all right?  Okay, but what you should do is, you know the normal where they hang out and smoke the weed all the time?  What you should do is you let him talk to Johnny B.  Well, I want to play a song here.  Oh my God, do we have time anymore? 
[74:00]
 I know, we just wasted like 15 minutes.  Well, it's a song that all our listeners sent us.  Yeah, I know.  You want to run later, you want to just blow it out now?  Let's play it.  All right, let's play it and get out of here.  We want to thank all you guys for sending us stuff for the show.  We have gotten, I don't know, a hundred copies of this damn song we're about to play.  Email to us, I guess because of the whole Yoshi the Porkman thing.  Yes.  So it's a little Chinese restaurant song.  All right, so we'll end the show with this and we'll see you guys tomorrow at 3. 
[74:30]
 We got to get back on the radio really fast.  All right, what happened?  Well, our listeners are going to kill us.  I promise I'd give out the address to the Sable pictures one more time.  Are you insane?  Oh, they would kill us.  Now I got to find it really fast.  If you want to see the pictures of Sable from WWF Naked for free,  we found them on a website.  I'm sure they're going to take them off probably by tomorrow.  You think?  Knowing how that works because the issue is not coming out till next week, right? 
[75:00]
 Yeah.  All right, so you want to see the pictures of Sable Naked.  You need to know how to spell though.  You should see how people are spelling wrestling.  Oh, no.  Oh, it says brutal.  They're like, I can't find the pictures and they're spelling wrestling.  W-R-E-S-T-E-L.  So here's the address one more time for the pictures for Sable.  All right, write it down.
