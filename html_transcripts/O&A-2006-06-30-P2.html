FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Walk away before I finish what you started face-to-face  That will push you in your place in this game  Before I finish what you started face-to-face  Everything will change  Sweet!  Don't say sweet, I'm diabetic. 
[00:00:30]  All right, we're off and running with some awesome jokes.  It's me, Dan, with Pat from Unaki.  It's the Pat from Unaki Hour, really, featuring Dan, just to help out.  How's it going there, Pat?  Oh, it's going wonderful.  I have nothing, but that hasn't stopped me for the first 42 years of my life.  Let it stop me now.  Cool, well, we're going to try to take some requests and bits and such,  but we don't really have any up there yet for some reason. 
[00:01:00]  What?  Any requests for me to shut the fuck up?  No.  All right, we'll just blindly take a call.  Let's try that.  Stop waving your hands, everybody.  All right, this guy's been on hold a while.  Here goes unscreened call number one.  Sir, who just heard the noise, I'm talking to you.  What's your request for it?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  What's your request?  This is Ben Dick, and I'd like to hear either Dragon Wagon  or Pat O'Brien Remix with Dr. Phil. 
[00:01:30]  All right, we'll see if we can get that on for you.  Thanks, buddy.  See ya.  Bye.  See, that's classic jock nonsense, just to say we're going to get that on for you.  We don't have either of those?  Too long.  Too long?  We need shorter requests, people.  You need to know our entire catalog.  Basically fans saying fuck you, caller.  Oh, jeez, Pat.  I'm saying I'm being edgy.  You sure are.  A black coalition?  Yeah, that's only a couple hours.  Yeah, we need short.  Hey, do we have, do we have, Derek? 
[00:02:00]  Do we have a good version of Ope's brother singing?  Elmo.  You don't know?  He's shrugging and making faces.  Because clearly, Derek's not a big fan of this particular segment.  Hey, Derek, what do you have?  Yeah, we'll start with that.  That'll be good.  Yeah, I just can't, oh.  Why would we have requests?  Sounds perfect for a Munaki radio.  Yeah.  Oh, I took a bit?  Yeah, we don't have one viable request going right now. 
[00:02:30]  Any Nathan's Eating Contest questions online?  Yeah, Pat.  When's that happen for you?  That's 4th of July in Coney Island.  Yeah?  Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.  And how do you like your chances?  I like my chances to watch very good.  As far as placing, I'll be in the top 15.  There's 15 competitors.  Do you have any strategies to get more FaceTime on TV this year? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I was thinking about shaving off my eyebrows and painting on some Uncle Al angry eyebrows.  You get really nervous on air, don't you?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, that's all right.  Me and Tom Arnold separated at birth.  Any kind of bit we could play there, Danny?  Anything just to break up the magic that is me and Pat talking about absolutely nothing?  Oh, here's something we could definitely play.  Line 2, Derek, can you honor that request, please? 
[00:03:30]  All right.  That's a little Drew Boogie for that ass.  It's ready to go.  We'll have more of your requests.  Call in.  You should have the number.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Or do the feedback.  Here it is at Drew Boogie Spread the Virus Remix.  Hit it.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  I'm a Drew Boogie.  Shake it in.

[00:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:07:30]  You're on.  Done like a true radio professional, Pat.  I do.  I thought you were going to try to work in some radio stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Big Kev's here to whore some stuff.  You know, I was listening to a podcast, and I was going, boy, this is a great podcast, and it turns out it's Big Kev's podcast.  Big Kev, tell us about it.  Well, Pat, it's a brand new venture that I've started.  Myself and a couple of friends of mine have put it together. 
[00:08:00]  It's called Big Kev's Geek Stuff.  Wow.  You can find it at bigkevsgeekstuff.com, and it's about an hour or so every week, and there's a new episode every week.  Wow.  It's exciting.  Is that plug?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Thank you, Danny.  Enjoy that breakfast, Danny.  Thank you.  And we just, we did have Shelton calling in, and he wanted to hear the message from Jim's mom on his answering machine, encouraging him to get his stuff together. 
[00:08:30]  Let's hear that now, Derek.  Go.  Hi, sweetheart.  It's mom.  How are you?  Jimmy, I know this is a little awkward, but everyone's fine here, but we heard the radio show.  We love it, by the way.  And you were talking about giving up, you know, ladies of the evening, which is a wonderful thing.  But you know what?  Dr. Phil always says replace something with something.  So I was thinking, you know, you have that nice gym downstairs, and, you know, just for like 20 minutes to a half an hour, and you would feel better. 
[00:09:00]  Use that.  And also, there's gyms in New York.  You could go.  You could exercise, and you would feel a whole lot better.  You'd lose a little weight.  You'd tone up, and you relieve, you know, tension and stuff, and you'd be meeting other people.  I don't know, honey.  I just thought it might be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm interfering.  I know.  I just, I'm thinking of you.  Nobody knows I'm calling.  So don't get offended or think I'm strange, but I am a mother, and I worry about you. 
[00:09:30]  You're doing so well.  Everything is falling into place.  This might be just one of the, you know, the health thing.  It would help, it would help you, sweetheart.  Well, anyway, that's it.  I'm not going to go on and on.  I know it's not my business.  But anyway, I love you, and I feel I can interfere because I'm your mother.  I'm taking a special license.  But anyway, we're looking forward to seeing you at Christmas.  I really hope you can make it.  And anyway, don't be mad at me, okay, sweetie?  I love you.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye. 
[00:10:00]  Ah, the memories.  Right, Pat?  Yeah.  I'm going to replace something with something.  Than, replace me, talking.  Fortunately, we have lots of stuff to do that with.  Ooh, that'll work, too.  Can you start working on line two, please?  Yes.  All right, thank you.  Pat?  Yes?  You were saying you want to try to take the eating contests.  Yeah, that was a little suggestion I had,  and I'd like to know what the listeners think. 
[00:10:30]  Having eating contests at the Traveling Roadshow,  Virus, Traveling Virus, whatever it's called.  It's an awesome plug.  If you want to get tickets to that, by the way,  you can go to get all the info at opanthony.com.  We can actually plug that here.  Ooh.  That's wonderful.  Nice.  And also, I want to plug my good friend Bob Kelly.  He will be at Caroline's this evening and throughout the weekend.  Call 212-757.  Don't ever throw a Sharpie in the middle of one of my plugs again, Kev. 
[00:11:00]  212-757-4100.  What do you got there, Danny?  And his phone doesn't smell like my asshole.  All right.  Let's take a request and have this sound like a normal show.  Rob from Nashville.  You're on with Pat and Fan, the most compelling radio ever.  What do you have for us?  Rob?  Yes.  Hey, Fan.  Hey, Pat.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  What's your request, sir?  I would like to hear the bit with the guy pranking the bar and the bartender flipping out. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know the name of it, but it's pretty damn funny.  All right.  Thanks, Rob.  We'll get that on for you.  Watch.  Thank you, fellas.  All right.  Hit it, Danny.  Yeah.  Hello.  Is Phil there?  Phil is not working today.  No, I'm supposed to get a call from Phil.  His last name is Lacio.  Who's this?  It's Bob.  Marino.  Well, that Phil doesn't work today.  No, not the one that works today.  Not a Phil.  Oh, what's his name? 
[00:12:00]  Lacio.  Phil Lacio.  Phil Lacio.  Phil Lacio.  Phil.  No, he's not here.  What?  He's not here.  How about Tommy?  Is Connie there?  Johnny who?  Connie.  Connie.  A girl.  Connie.  No, girls can come in this bar.  We have no room here.  What number did you want?  This is the two bar.  Yeah, but there's no women in here. 
[00:12:30]  Who is this?  No women come in here.  I'm sorry.  The two bar.  It is the two bar, but no women come in here.  Who's the threat?  Yeah.  How about sucking my prick?  Eh?  Suck my prick?  Why don't you come over?  I'll suck your prigots.  Why don't you come over, you son of a bitch, you motherfucker?  Why don't you go out and fuck your mother, you cocksucker?  Come on over here.  Come on over.  Talk to me.  You're a person to person.  Why don't you come over, you fucking bum. 
[00:13:00]  You're too yellow.  I'll cut your balls off.  Yeah, just the two bar.  Yeah.  Can I speak to Ben, please?  Anybody named Ben?  Ben?  Ben, anybody named Ben?  Ben, it is Ben.  Nobody, Ben.  His name is an Italian fellow, D-Banana.  Who?  D-Banana. 
[00:13:30]  D-Banana.  D-Banana!  Ben, D-Banana.  Nobody, Ben.  Ben, D-Banana, no?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello.  Oh, it's Jim then?  Who?  Jim.  Jim who?  Jim.  Who do you want to talk to?  Jim.  Jim who?  Nazium.  Who?  Nazium.  Jim, maybe. 
[00:14:00]  Jim, maybe.  Are you sure?  Positive.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Welcome back to the magic.  What are you doing, Travis?  Nothing.  All right, thanks for adding.  Yeah.  Sam's giving me two gigantic thumbs up from the booth.  They're freakish.  So, Pat, I mean, this should be your time to shine.  This is...  Well, my head's shining. 
[00:14:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Yeah.  Munaki Radio is now abortion radio.  No, but, you know...  Spilling out all over your ears.  If they were to offer you a golden ticket for the Pat from Munaki show, what do you think  it would consist of?  Uh, it would consist of...  You know, I really thought I'd do sort of like a tough crowd on radio.  I think that idea has come up.  What kind of guests would you have to, you know, discuss the issues?  Uh, probably, uh, anybody that would go on the radio. 
[00:15:00]  Probably, like, uh, C-level comedians.  C-level?  Yes.  Aiming high.  Yeah, all females, C-level.  Hey, get it?  See?  Come on.  Um, cool.  We're gonna...  Ha, ha, ha.  I just got that little delivery.  Well, yeah, but Danny just gave me a suggestion.  Yeah, we're not...  We'll try to pitch it a little bit more.  Any requests?  Free bird?  Greengrass high tides?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  All right, we're gonna get another request going.  Uh, Eric from Oklahoma, go ahead, what's your request for the Than and Pat hour? 
[00:15:30]  Ooh.  An okey.  Eric, go ahead, buddy.  Eric!  Hello?  Yeah, Eric.  Hi.  Hi.  I want to hear a chemistry song about Steve's car, the hybrid song.  Ah, yes, the one featuring the sound effect that isn't in front of me.  Oh, well.  Exactly.  All right, Derek.  Please put everyone out of their...  Yeah, sure.  Michael Winslow from Unaki.  Ha, ha.  Oh, stop talking. 
[00:16:00]  Thank you.  Just stop talking.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I know a big bear.  He talks with good diction.  Hibernates in a Toyota with good fuel emissions and great tax deductions.  His habitat's a hybrid.  His paws are on the steering wheel.  He barely fits inside it.  His cave has XM and a keyless entry.  Don't leave a scent in your tent.  His belly is empty.  The only bear I know with gastric bypass. 
[00:16:30]  Smarter than the average.  Roll up in the hybrid and steal your picnic basket.  The ranger's lunch always makes his belly groan.  The last I seen him, he was speeding around Jellystone.  Getting 40 miles per gallon.  Rolling through the Rockies.  Doing Ramon promos for two-dish jockeys.  Steve's a piece of garbage.  Forged for nuts and berries.  Top of the food chain but drives a car for ferries.  Piece of shit.  Stores energy with friction and magnets.  Ramon.  Hybrids are for faggots.  Hybrids are gay.  Steve's a queer.  Plug in your automobile. 
[00:17:00]  You take it in the rear.  You homo.  Yo, his car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one.  Spend more than six grand.  Hybrids are gay.  Steve's a queer.  If you plug in your automobile.  You take it in the rear.  You homo.  His car got a kickstand.  Go and buy a new one.  Spend more than six grand.  Hybrids are gay.  Hybrids are gay.  This is a good radio show because right before the mics go on, Danny has to yell, shut up 
[00:17:30]  at Pat.  Thank you, Danny.  We're taking you behind the scenes.  You know what?  As good as this banter is, I'm going to just keep the request going right along.  Viola from Oklahoma.  Viola, please go ahead with your request.  How's it going?  Ooh, Viola.  I'm doing good.  I would like to actually hear Brother Joe's song, Cunt.  All right.  That's one of the benefits of XM Satellite Radio, man. 
[00:18:00]  Do you occasionally have cunt in your mouth, young lady?  All right.  All right.  Don't.  All right.  Thanks, Viola.  All right, Danny.  I believe you have that ready to go.  I do indeed.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Hit it.  See, it's for the way you crap on me. 
[00:18:30]  You, it's cause you're ugly, and so's your peach.  And, but no, I never told you that I railed your sister.  Tee, thanks for the Hummers.  They were better than your mothers.  Cunt is all you'll ever be.  It's true.  Cunt, you must be more than one or two. 
[00:19:00]  Pew, your gas is stanky, and your ass is always cranky.  Cunt, the word was made for you.  See, it's for castration.  Drive that on me.  Hey, hey, you.  Well, I urinated.  Have a shot, it's free.  And for some big negro tearing up your leather cheerio team. 
[00:19:30]  Tee, you friggin' twat, no, you will never be forgotten.  Cunt, is all you've ever been to me.  A cunt, and a really big one.  And all my friends agree.  You're that slang word for vagina.  Can't describe you any finer.  Cunt, the word's just right for you. 
[00:20:00]  Whoa, cunt, the word was made for you.  Can I do that, bop, bop, cunt, the word's made for you.  Sweet, Pat.  You feel it?  Yeah, I feel it.  You having fun here?  Yeah.  What was the fart noise for?  That was that Geico commercial.  You feel it?  Yeah, I'm feeling it.  Oh.  Oh.  Never mind. 
[00:20:30]  I just, I like to think sometimes I say occasionally funny things.  Pat, you just suck all of my modest abilities right out of my ass.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  No homo.  How'd you feel getting naked?  I felt a little breeze there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No, I mean like in terms of your personal worth.  Uh, none.  I have none.  I mean, is that the first time you've gotten publicly naked?  Uh, yeah, pretty much.  Pretty much. 
[00:21:00]  That's not true.  He did dance on top of his van at the RCS.  He's in his tight whities.  Actually, here's a little unknown fact.  I was in the man boob contest on NEW.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I was.  Nice.  This really is.  My humiliation is never ending.  Oh, I just.  Oh, boy.  I wonder what.  I wonder what Paul from Wisconsin has to say.  Yeah.  Hey, she said.  Oh, stop.  Paul from Wisconsin.  What do you, uh, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:21:30]  What do you want to request?  Uh, another Brother Joe song.  The one about Black Girl would be great.  Yes, two for Friday.  Hit it.  You got it, mister.  Wouldn't that be?  Thank you.  I was born and raised in New York City in a housing project way up in the hood.  I dressed in dark clothing, so folks started calling me Black Girl.  Oh, and they used to laugh about it, because deep down they knew they'd call me that,  because I was as black as soot.  I've always been a lazy man.  A couch potato with a clicker in my hand. 
[00:22:00]  See, motivation I never had.  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad.  For 20 years, I never got a raise.  I'm 33 and I've never been late.  I look busy, but I'm not.  I'm just walking around.  I pick up some papers and I put them back down.  Someday I'm gonna stop paying my rent.  Live in a refrigerator box.  Never get out of bed.  I'm a black girl.  A genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through. 
[00:22:30]  Hard times at N-E-W.  Then one day, some lame brains came and took O&A away.  And at the age of 33, I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders.  And Ron and Fezzy knew what I was going through.  Every morning, I'd unlock the door.  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more.  Then I'd put away the bathroom key. 
[00:23:00]  Everybody was depending on me.  I'd eat a chicken wing with lemonade.  Lord, give me strength to make another day.  Times I felt I couldn't go on.  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone.  Got lost in the van.  I did my PSAs.  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day.  I'm black girl.  A genuine lazy bum.  I'll always make it through. 
[00:23:30]  Hard times at N-E-W.  I could hear a stop zone say,  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum.  You'll always make it through.  Hard times at N-E-W.  Ken and Jeremy say,  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum.  You'll always make it through.  Ah, the sweet sounds of Brother Joe. 
[00:24:00]  Pat, you were doing all of your talking off-air,  of course, again.  We appreciate that.  What were you saying?  You were talking about Bob Kelly.  He's a great comedian,  and I'd like to personally apologize for what I was saying.  Yeah, you took what was interesting about what you were saying  and replaced it with something that's not interesting whatsoever.  Not what you were saying.  He doesn't care if you are mad at...  I'll have to say it.  He does not care that you're mad because he kicked you. 
[00:24:30]  That's interesting.  It's called a conflict.  Oh, okay.  So you think he might have overreacted?  Yeah, I thought he was being somewhat emotional.  We were sort of going with the flow of the radio show,  and he tried snapping my knee and kicking my gut in like a door.  Pat, it looked like he kicked you hard.  Yeah, he did.  Like once he kind of missed, but once he hit you pretty good.  If my leg was standing up straight, he would have snapped it.  It would have hyperextended.  Definitely.  Good thing I learned my defensive techniques from Master Poe. 
[00:25:00]  Good thing he's not here, too.  Masterpoe.com.  I'll have to wipe it in the toilet.  Masterpoeisback.com.  Derek's very, oh, I know why.  He's busy scrolling something down on a piece of paper, and I know exactly why.  All right, this is what we're talking about.  We actually, this better be real, Sam, or I'll kill you.  All right, Chris, Chris from Jersey.  Ooh.  What's up, buddy?  You have a question for Pat?  Yeah, I've got a question about the hot dog contest. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, sure.  Yes, are they regulation hot dogs, and are condiments illegal?  Uh, no, you can't.  Not you shit dick.  Oh.  All right.  That's very hurtful, sir.  That was almost a bit we had going.  Speaking of Bob Kelly a minute ago.  He's going to be at Caroline's.  Yes.  Today, tomorrow, Sunday.  Call 212-757-4100.  I may go to one of his shows and say hi.  To get tickets.  And then we're doing, and speaking of Bob Kelly, 
[00:26:00]  we're going to play, we all know when he broke his knee was a wonderful.  Absolutely, and for all those who don't know,  you could actually watch it this Sunday when it airs live on HBO for Torgasm.  Look at Danny plugging the crap out of Bob.  Torgasm is, uh.  11th.  Is, uh, yeah.  On HBO's, uh, Eastern, I guess.  Yes.  Yeah.  And this, someone took the audio of him breaking his knee  and, uh, made it into a fun little sort of hip-hop number.  Oh, we got to hear it now?  Yes, you are.  I haven't heard this in so long, and it's so, so hysterically funny. 
[00:26:30]  All right, Danny, you've been lobbying for this.  I want to hear it.  Danny from New York, let's hear your...  I want to hear the Broke My Knee Man song.  Bob Kelly's pain will be our enjoyment.  Yeah.  Way down.  I broke my knee man, I broke my knee man, I broke my knee man, I broke my knee dude. 
[00:27:00]  Fuck!  I broke my knee man, I broke my knee man, I broke my knee man, I broke my knee dude.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Hold my hand, man.  Ow!  I got to squeeze something.  Ow!  Way up!  On the side.  On the side.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I broke my knee man!  Shit.  It bent backwards.  Hyper extend.

[00:29:30]  Sweet.  Pat.  Awesome.  We're back, buddy.  Finn.  You fired up?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Danny, you said some of the reviews are coming in for the show?  Hoo-hoo.  In fact, they are.  All right, let's hear them.  All right.  You folks fell on your face.  Ow.  You get an F minus in my book.  That just about sums up.  That's harsh.  Yeah.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh, dear Lord.  Ah.  All right, that's it for the magic that was the Than and Pat radio hour. 
[00:30:00]  I don't want it.  Yeah, that sums it up.  Do you have fun, Pat?  Oh, yeah.  I'm about ready to do a backflip.  Boring.  Oh.  Okay, stop hitting buttons.  I know.  I'm just really tired.  I want to go home.  All right.  Pat, thank you for staying around and doing this with us.  Are you going to be doing any club dates with your comedy?  No, I'm going away for the weekend.  Okay, that sounds good.  But thanks for asking.  Oh, no problem. 
[00:30:30]  He's got a great heart.  All right, let's get the hell out of here.  Have a great 4th of July, everybody.  Ooh, Nathan's finals.  Me losing.  And Pat will be in his contest.  We'll see you Thursday.  I think we're giving away tickets.  If you see my van, the unofficial wow van.  You know how good an out that was?  That was the out.  Oh, okay.  Give it away tickets.
