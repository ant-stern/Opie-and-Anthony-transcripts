<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with XM Radio advertisements, showcasing the Polk XM Reference Tuner.  This was followed by the shocking audio of a man tasering himself. The hosts then discussed a video of Eddie from Big Brother appearing in a Fozzy Band video (featuring Chris Jericho) available online.  A snippet of Fozzy's "Enemy" was played.  The conversation quickly shifted to Tom Sizemore's arrest for using a "Wizinator" to cheat on drug tests.  Numerous callers shared their experiences with, or knowledge of, methods for passing drug tests, ranging from using dehydrated urine and temperature-regulating devices to more extreme methods like using IV bags of urine or inserting a friend's urine vaginally. A former New Orleans police officer recounted a similar experience with a suspect.  The legal loopholes surrounding police interactions during drug tests were also discussed. The NHL season cancellation was briefly mentioned, met with indifference from the hosts.  Finally, this segment concluded with Jimmy's regret over missing a red-carpet event (potentially seeing Robert De Niro) due to napping, and brief mentions of a train wreck video and a lottery winner's near-bankruptcy.

The following segment featured a rambling conversation including a story from Opie about an awkward encounter with Robert De Niro, expressing regret at not mentioning his love for *King of Comedy*.  A call from Earl, a "big celebrity," followed, recounting a dinner near John McEnroe. The conversation meandered through Black History Month, Central Park gates, and Earl's dating life (last sexual encounter: November 2001).  Earl's call was punctuated by poor audio quality and seemingly rehearsed lines.  Opie and Anthony then voiced their frustrations with XM Radio's marketing campaign for their show, comparing the promised promotional efforts to the underwhelming reality.  A significant portion of the segment was dedicated to a discussion of sexual fetishes, sparked by a news story about a dominatrix lawsuit.  Jimmy Norton shared personal anecdotes involving urination and a dominatrix he knew, and various callers detailed their own sexual preferences and experiences, including specific fetishes and pornography preferences.  The segment was rife with explicit descriptions of sexual acts.

The next segment focused on sexually explicit scenes in movies such as *Swimming Pool*, *Irreversible*, and *8mm*.  Graphic details from these films were described, with emphasis on female nudity and sexual acts. *Rich in Philly* was also discussed.  A parody song, "Silence of the Lambs, the Musical," with vulgar lyrics, was played.  The hosts then discussed male and female energy levels after sex.  Upcoming guests Charlie Murphy, Billy Burr, Donnell Rawlings (from *The Chappelle Show*), and Maroon 5 (calling in) were mentioned.  The Grammy Awards and the Tony Awards were criticized, including a homophobic rant about the latter. The retirements of George Michael and Biz Markie were announced.  A caller from Oregon commented on the vague thank-yous to romantic partners often given by Broadway award winners, leading to a discussion of various musicals, often with negative opinions. This segment included numerous tangents, listener calls, and more crude comments.

The subsequent segment centered on Bob's difficulties creating a "Full Metal Comedy" DVD for troops overseas.  Music on the Run (truetone.com), owned by Adriana Rewati, refused to produce it, citing their lack of support for the troops and the war.  Opie and Anthony offered to film a segment for the DVD.  The conversation shifted to Colin Quinn's surprisingly lucky poker win on Bravo, with audio clips playing. Adam Levine from Maroon 5 then called in, discussing their Grammy win, the pressure of accepting the award, and his single status. Listener feedback on Maroon 5's "She Will Be Loved" was read. Charlie Murphy, Billy Burr, and Darnell from *Chappelle's Show* were welcomed as guests. The conversation covered their upcoming shows, the delay of *Chappelle's Show*, and anecdotes, notably Charlie Murphy's stories about Rick James and Prince. Charlie Murphy's intimidating demeanor and past legal troubles were also discussed.  The segment concluded with listener calls and further discussion about the guestsâ€™ careers and personal lives, and a mention of the hosts' appearances in Grand Theft Auto.

The final segment featured Charlie Murphy, Donnell Rawlings, and Bill Burr as in-studio guests. The conversation revolved around their experiences on *Chappelle's Show*, including specific sketches like "Rick James," "The Racial Draft," and "Wayne Brady."  Callers frequently attempted to plug Jim Norton's shows.  Humorous banter ensued, including jokes about Bill Burr's alleged dog abuse and a fabricated story about Charlie Murphy's movie career. Their current stand-up tour and experiences with fans were also discussed. The segment ended with a vulgar call to a customer service line and XM Satellite Radio advertisements.

[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Wonderful.  Oh, wait.  We have the audio there.  We do?  I just realized it was in front of me.  Yeah, the video's up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com, but here's the audio.  The guy tasering himself right to his neck. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I've got my taser.  I've got my taser.  I've got my taser.  I've got my taser here.  I've got my taser here.  I've got my taser here.  I've got my taser here.  This taser has 80,000 volts worth of electrical current.  I'll just show you this wheel.  I've got my taser here.  I've got my taser here.  I've got my taser here.  What you're hearing is him trying to get back up off the ground. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, fuck.  What an idiot. 
[00:09:00]  Well, the video's up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Also up there, Eddie from Big Brother, old friend of the show.  Yeah.  One-legged Eddie.  Sure.  You might remember him.  He's a good friend and stuff.  He emailed me.  He's in the new Fozzy video.  Fozzy has a video out?  It's Chris Jericho from the WWE.  Of course it is.  He started this goof band that did a bunch of cover albums, I guess, or a couple cover CDs. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And now he's doing originals, and they got this video out.  I think it's called Enemy or something like that.  Uh-huh.  And Eddie is starring in it.  And we got the video up on foundrymusic.com.  He does a great job with it.  Did he make it?  Did he have something to do with it?  Steve is telling me that he directed and produced it or something like that.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So it's a pretty cool-looking video.  The song is not bad.  Yeah.  It's like you said, a little dated.  But, um...  If it came out in, like, 98, I think it would have a shot.  Yeah.  Wait, we have the Fozzy song? 
[00:10:00]  Wow.  We'll listen to just a piece.  Chris Jericho.  Do you remember me?  You can't see the things that make me who I am.  You'll never understand. 
[00:10:30]  And I got you on this.  You're living on my chest.  You're in the dome on my back.  And these are the days that I dream about.  And you're always there to remind me.  And you're my enemy.  All that we had is gone away. 
[00:11:00]  And there are times that fade away.  But you'll still be mine.  And I'm in the room.  Yeah.  It's really not that bad.  This guy's a little generic.  I guess a lot of active rock radio stations around America are playing it.  Probably a channel on XM Satellite Radio as well.  Is he still calling himself Moon Juice?  Mule Juice McQuaid McQueen?  What the hell was that name he had? 
[00:11:30]  I think he's taking it very seriously now.  Moon Goose McQueen?  Moon Goose?  Remember he wouldn't break character.  He came in, did an interview with us.  And we were calling him Chris.  And he was like, what?  Who is that?  Who are you talking about?  I'm Mule Juice or something.  Whatever.  But the video's up on foundrymusic.com and opnancy.com.  I didn't know the song had a little bit of a buzz.  Steve was telling me radio's definitely playing that thing.  It's the only video on foundry that doesn't have a nude woman or someone being impaled on something. 
[00:12:00]  I love foundry.  Well, Steve is a sick app because someone sent me a story about Tom Sizemore.  Tom Sizemore is the actor.  He's been in a bunch of things.  Yeah, Saving Private Ryan.  Exactly.  He usually plays the gruff sergeant type guy.  Right.  That's like his character.  And apparently he's like that at home because I guess he punched his wife or girlfriend in the face.  Well, he was going out with Heidi Fleiss.  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  She seems like she would deserve to be punched though.  And now he's on probation or whatever.  So he has to take the drug test.  He's got to pee into a jar.  And he got caught using a fake penis.  The Wizinator.  It's called The Wizinator.  The Wizinator.  Come see my movie The Wizinator.  The Wizinator 2 and 3.  The Wizinator.  Wow.  I.  I.  How do you get caught using a fake penis?  I don't get this.  The, uh, apparently the urine sample that he submitted was too cold to have come from a human body. 
[00:13:00]  So they, they, they did a, basically a strip search and they found that on him.  I'm a police officer.  Yeah, I, I would find the, the Wizinator.  But, uh.  And so Steve, the sick F, uh, not only found the Wizinator product, he's got all the, the photographs here.  Including a guy using it.  Yeah.  Peeing into, into one of those jars you have to pee into.  Yeah.  Who foals for this?  With his fake penis.  Now, uh.  How does it work?  Does anyone know?  You, you, it's, it's, it's a hollowed out, for lack of a better term, I guess a dildo that's strapped to a, uh, like a jock strap. 
[00:13:30]  And inside, you've got a syringe that you pump this heated, clean urine into.  And you heat it up with those, um, those gloves that they sell in camping stores, those glove liners.  Yeah.  And apparently, you know, you're supposed to store clean urine in there, so when you take a drug test, it looks like you're actually peeing into a cup.  Uh-huh.  You know, but it's a, it's a dildo.  You know, I mean, if anybody inspects for, you know, more than a, for closer than a hundred feet away, they're going to see.  So, uh, you know what, I don't really understand. 
[00:14:00]  You know what, though, I bet you druggies have been getting away with this for many, many years.  And now they're going to test.  And now the cops are on to this type of thing.  Yeah.  They're probably checking for the, the whizinator and other, other apparatuses that people may be using to, to, you know, pass their drug test.  Too cool to have come from Sizemore's body.  Was he using the heating pads?  It was, apparently, but I guess, like anything, that they're going to wear off.  You know, those, those, those liners are, they're, they're, they're chemical-based, aren't they?  It's like, um, they've got, you know, liquid-lined gloves that heat your hands up. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, and they run out after a while.  Exactly.  How embarrassing, though, to get caught wearing a fake dick to pass a drug test.  How desperate are you?  He's Tom Sizemore, and, and he's there, you know what it is?  You, you got a picture in his house, the thing that went on before this.  He's Tom Sizemore, and he's, they're naked, strapping this thing on.  How awful is that?  And then he's, you're a star, and you have to go through this crap, putting, putting the  Wizenator on.  Well, the thing that actually gave him away was that he used the black model. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  But, man, he got, he gets caught with this thing.  So.  Ouch.  There you have it.  He's caught using a fake penis sewn into his box of shorts and filled with clean urine.  Yeah.  Where did he get the urine?  Can you buy that online?  Not that I'm aware of.  Really?  You probably store it up.  You can probably put it in the freezer.  Oh, I hear, I hear, yeah, I hear you get your friend to do it.  What's wrong with you, Steve?  I've never had to take a urine test.  You get that straight edge friend of yours, hey, dude, here's a hundred bucks, pee into 
[00:15:30]  this for me.  Thank you.  There you go.  I'll see you later, man.  I gotta go, you know, take my drug test.  Well, now you know.  He had charges of methamphetamine possession and beating his ex-girlfriend, Heidi Fleiss.  Meth?  Ooh.  More meth.  More meth.  Tom Sizemore's a pretty big guy, and Heidi Fleiss is pretty skinny.  Get a Tom Sizemore all hopped up on the crystal meth, just punching her right in the face. 
[00:16:00]  I'd pay to see that in a movie.  And then he's strapping on fake penises.  Not fake penises.  The whizzenator.  This guy's life went drastically wrong, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, because then you get through something like this, and no one hires you for movies  anymore.  Is he doing anything?  No, I don't think so.  Anything else?  I know we have the IMDB.  Well, let's see.  Fly Boys, Edmund, Thieves, and Holly.  That's what's coming out in 2005, 2006. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I guess he's still doing okay.  He played Pete Rose in Hustle.  They put that retard hair on him, and he did a good job in that one.  All right.  Well, we've got a guy on the line, Anthony.  Henry, not Andre.  Henry from Florida.  He has used a whizzenator.  Henry!  Hey, Pete, Tiff, Opie, and Anthony.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  Hello, Henry.  Listen, here's the deal.  In Texas, there's a thing online called www.urinetheclear.com. 
[00:17:00]  And what that is, it's dehydrated urine, and it works.  I've got a buddy that's a major pothead, and he always gets clean tests.  It's dehydrated.  You put it in a, I don't know, man, whatever those things are, the little packs that hold water, like a, for a diabetic, maybe, carries.  And you mix it up in there, put the hand warmer on it, and it works. 
[00:17:30]  He's passed every one.  Wow.  You'reintheclear.com.  Yeah, but how does he use it?  Well, he does.  Because nowadays, I hear they sort of watch it take leaks now.  No, they don't.  That's why the whizzenator.  Oh, it's still against the law.  They can't watch you use it.  What you do is you go in there with some baggy khakis.  You've got your little satchel in there that's got like a saline bag is what it is.  You put tap water in it.  I mean, not tap water, but you have to have distilled water. 
[00:18:00]  You put it in there with it, and you put the hand warmers on it, and it's got a temperature thing on the bag.  And when it gets to the right temperature, you just go in there, and when you pull your hog out, you just pull the hose out and take the little clip off, and nobody would know the difference.  But I've even heard my buddy tell me of times that he's had to take his clothes off and put on like a little gurney jacket, and he still has it taped to his front.  So they can't watch you do that, and it's youreintheclear.com.  I've got to tell you, man, you people love your pot. 
[00:18:30]  You've got to have your dope.  You'll go through a lot of crazy things and pass these drug tests.  Well, you know, hey, I'm going to tell you, man, for like two years after I quit smoking pot, I would still go and get him to hit me up with one.  It's about $160, but, you know, you just carry it around a little vial.  You better not ever get caught with it because it looks like crack.  Right.  All right.  Well, thank you, Henry.  Hey, man, thanks.  Let's go to a cop in New Orleans.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I worked down there as a police officer. 
[00:19:00]  I actually met Norton when he flew into the airport.  Oh, hey, what's up?  What's your name?  Brian.  Oh, Brian, okay, you're with Dan and, oh, oh, God, I forget the other guy's name.  His name was Chad and Dave, actually.  Oh, Dave, okay, thanks, man, I remember you.  Good one.  Yeah.  I still remember that.  I remember a case nights long ago where a guy had some packages of stuff called Urine Luck, you know, U-R-I-N-E.  Urine Luck.  It was like IV bags full of store-bought piss that he just, like, strapped to his leg.  He said it kept it warm and he was able to, you know, keep his job and, you know, throw us off for a while. 
[00:19:30]  Well, is it actual urine or is it like this guy had before, the dried stuff that gets something added to it?  This was actual liquid urine, like in a sack, like in a little IV bag.  It had little straps to strap it to your inner thigh and, like a hose you're supposed to run on the side of your cock or something.  And you caught the guy?  Well, I assisted some agents doing a warrant on the house, actually.  That's classy.  But it freaked me out because we walk in there and it's like, you know, this guy's got bags of piss under his bed, you know? 
[00:20:00]  If you're at the point where the court is ordering you to take urine tests for drugs, perhaps you should just stop doing the drugs.  You know, you've reached that point where you've got to maybe say to yourself, this has gotten me into some trouble, you know?  Perhaps I should stop doing the drugs and just pee myself and, you know, give that to the people.  Can you imagine, I mean, when you do drugs and stuff, you're paranoid to begin with and you've decided, ah, I'm going to continue doing drugs.  I know I got my test coming. 
[00:20:30]  Can you imagine the day of the test where you're in your bathroom at your house strapping on a fake dick, making sure it all looks good.  It feels like Midnight Express where you're taping the hashish to your body.  Right.  Walking on the line to the airplane, you know, all nervous.  Then you jump in your car, the long ride to wherever you have to do these things, the police station, whatever.  Then you walk in the bathroom with the little cop hoping it's going to work.  Who needs that kind of stress in their life?  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not worth it.  Then you pull out your fake penis and squeeze it into the cup. 
[00:21:00]  Who wouldn't just be all wide-eyed sweating and, you know, shake the guy's hand that it's all damp and wet?  Right.  You know, who could take that kind of pressure?  What are you, James Bond?  I know.  You know, who could take that kind of stress?  Right before you take out your fake penis, you make up with Burt Reynolds after you're falling out and then you stand in the mirror.  Let's go to North Carolina.  Jay, what's up, buddy?  Hello?  Go ahead, Jay.  Yeah, I'm a truck driver.  I'm going to take drug tests all the time. 
[00:21:30]  And what I do is I get one of my buddies that don't smoke and I get him to piss in a cup for me and then I'll pour it in a rubber and tie it in a knot, throw it in between my nuts and my legs and walk in there and pour it in their little cup.  And if the temperature ain't right, sometimes it might be 94, 95 degrees, I take a lighter out of my pocket, hold it up to that temperature strip until it gets 98 degrees, and I'll walk back out and give it to the nurse and go back to my car. 
[00:22:00]  It's simple shit.  But isn't it a plastic container that you're putting it in?  Punch it out.  All right, yeah.  They give you plastic containers.  How is he holding a lighter up to a plastic container?  You can still do it.  How?  Definitely.  I mean, you can't put the lighter right on it.  You've got to, you know, it'll probably take a little while, but you can eat up that cup without burning it.  It's a little weird.  You've got to know what you're doing, I'm thinking.  A bunch of people checking in saying it's not illegal to watch the guy take his urine test. 
[00:22:30]  Rooster.  Yeah, man.  Go ahead, buddy.  Hey, well, you guys are hard to hear.  Anyway, well, one guy, first of all, talking about holding my lighter up, that's bullshit, because, I mean, you'll have black marks all over the bottom of it.  Yeah, it'll be old.  But anyway, I used to get tested at my probation officer, and that one caller said it's illegal for them to watch you piss in the cup.  He's full of shit, because them probation officers do what they want to do. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  They're going to watch you.  Yeah.  Anyway, most people...  Hey, guys, I can't hear you.  I'm punching out.  All right, he can't hear us.  I love this.  Most people, when it comes to the laws that call in, they really have no clue.  Like, when people try to talk about the laws in this country and go, no, it's illegal to do this, it's probably wrong.  We've noticed that for years.  People just can't quite get it right.  My stupid ex-girlfriend years ago was one of these people, like, you know, if you get pulled over by a cop, the ticket won't count if it's at night and he was facing you, but he didn't have his headlights on. 
[00:23:30]  I'm like, what are you talking about?  People just have no clue.  He's like, shut your mouth.  That's not the truth.  Like, I'm going to say to the judge, he didn't have his headlights on and I was coming down the road, the judge is going to go, well, that ticket is dismissed.  And, by the way, officer, you're fired.  You dumb whore.  That's like...  You guys bring up a great point.  How many times have you heard stuff like this?  You always hear stuff like that, and it's ridiculous, and you want to smack these people in the head. 
[00:24:00]  You get excited for the split second, like, you believe them.  Oh, you found a loophole.  You found a loophole for me.  I can't wait to go to court.  I'm in.  I'm in.  Dude, if the cop pulls you over, just say, hey, I want to see when the last time that radar detector was calibrated.  Calibrated.  That's another big one.  Dude, if you get a ticket next to a fire hydrant, you've got to ask if the person that gave you the ticket had a calibrated ruler in their car and measured the full... 
[00:24:30]  Shut up, idiot.  Oh, man, is that the truth.  Another big misconception is that, and this one's used all the time, and you watch episodes of cops and see people foiled by this all the time.  The prostitutes, when they ask, are you a cop, because legally you have to tell me if you're a cop, no, I'm not a cop.  And the cop's sitting there going, no, I'm not a cop.  Don't be silly.  Oh, okay.  I'll suck it for $10.  And then there it is.  It busted.  I asked a guy in Vice.  Remember we were in jail for the voyeur bus.  Me and Louis were sitting there. 
[00:25:00]  One of the guys that came over and bought us vending machine food worked in Vice.  And I asked him about, like, just the myth that, like, a lot of times a prostitute, what she'll do when you pull up, is she'll reach in and rub your crotch to make sure you're not a cop.  And I'm like, so does that actually work?  He goes, dude, I don't care.  Let them rub it, tug it, do whatever they want.  I'll still bust them.  They don't care.  No, they can care less.  These people that come out with these laws, these friggin' weekend lawyers, they think they're lawyers and they know nothing.  Well, we got another guy, Mark in Texas.  Mark, let's go.  Hey, man, I was on paper for 13 years in Texas. 
[00:25:30]  And I've had some of them that were straight Peter Gazers.  I mean, they'll sit there and watch you.  I had one that actually bit his lip, man.  I freaked out.  I got so bladder shot, I couldn't even piss.  Wait, he's...  They can sit and watch you.  He is watching you take a leak, and he was getting so into it that he bit his lip?  Yeah, he was a fraggot, man.  He bit his lip.  He was a new guy.  Oh.  I saw him, and right when he did it, I just, hell, I couldn't piss.  I had to get another PO in there with me. 
[00:26:00]  But, yeah, they can sit and watch you legally.  That guy wasn't right.  That's classic.  Know what I'm learning on this first half hour today, Anthony?  We have a lot of drug addicts that listen to us.  It does seem to be.  Because there's another 10 we could go to here.  It's just over and over again.  Rob on Long Island.  Go ahead.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  How you doing, my meaty-breasted angel?  Hi, Rob from Long Island.  Yeah.  My brother, what he does every month, he helps his friend out in school.  What he does is he pees into a little vising bottle for this girl that he knows, and then 
[00:26:30]  this girl actually inserts it into her vag, and so, like, now her body's heating it up,  and then whenever she's got to go take her test, she'll just sit in the stall, or even  if the girl's watching, she'll, like, I don't know, flex her muscles or squeeze her thighs  together or whatever, and it'll squirt right out into the cup.  So it looks like she's actually taking a piss, but it's his piss in the vising bottle that  Let's calm down.  She's got to have great muscles down there to pull her away.  She's using her hand, probably.  She reaches down for her hand.  Yeah.  Anthony, have you ever seen the movie Rounders before?  Of course. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  It's, like, one of the best movies about, like, showing, like, the life of, like, a professional  polka player, you know?  That one's awesome.  Yeah, it's a great movie.  All right.  I own that one.  Thank you, Rob.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Well, why don't we take our first break, Anthony?  All right.  Just getting warmed up, actually.  We've got lots to do today.  Brian from L.A., one of the few jobs, I have one of the few jobs that you'd get fired if  you passed a drug test.  I work for Joe Rogan, and I'd be fired if I didn't smoke weed.  Brian in L.A.  Hey, do you guys know that if you get pulled over and a cop doesn't say, good night, sir, 
[00:27:30]  you can rip the ticket up and throw it in his face and grab his gun?  Oh, that's fantastic.  You guys have brought up a great one, man.  People are such tools.  And I believe every one of them.  I'm like, really cool, man.  Thanks.  It's always something that the cop didn't do.  So you're like, oh, I'm out of it.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course you're not out of it.  You're not.  All right.  This might make sense.  We had a guy that came on the show and told you how to get out of speeding tickets. 
[00:28:00]  Beat the cop, right?  Yeah.  But most of this stuff was like this crap that you hear on the street.  Well, I knew one guy that actually the cops were following him, and he went through a  red light, and the cops didn't do anything.  They didn't even pull him over.  He went through a second red light.  They didn't even pull him over.  He went through three red lights, and the cops didn't even stop him.  So when they walk up to his car, he goes, why didn't you pull me over after the first  one?  Same guy actually went out to be an air marshal and said, shoot the hostage.  You got to shoot the hostage. 
[00:28:30]  Remember that story?  Jackass.  Liar.  Sorry, that was real inside.  A guy told me an ant that story.  You might have been there, too.  It was at dinner one night, and he said that he beat the cops because he wouldn't pull over,  and they didn't pull him over immediately.  So he challenged him on the fact that he didn't pull him over after the first red light.  When you're sitting there listening to these stories, you just want to reach out and smack  them in the head.  Yeah, so I went through three red lights, and I just wouldn't pull over, and the cop  just gave up.  Yeah, sure he did.  Sure he did.  Sure he did.  No, that didn't get him more and more aggravated. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  You didn't get a billy club to the temple when he finally did pull you over.  So what happened, Rodney?  I refused to get up, and those L.A. cops finally just said, all right, fuck it.  Let him lay here.  Hey, what is the punishment for faking a pee test?  Eric?  Yeah, hey, guys.  Go ahead.  Hey, I got a friend of mine.  He's a federal probation officer.  Yeah.  And it's up to promote these people who want to try and fake these drug tests.  If you're on paper and you violate your paper by testing positive, you know, or if they 
[00:29:30]  catch you with one of these devices, they're going to retest you.  If you violate your probation, they're going to give you that sentence for violating it.  Plus, the federal jurisdictions can add another three to five years for trying to fake it in federal courts.  Well, there you have it.  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah, so any words is avoiding me.  All right.  Cool.  Thanks.  All right.  As we go to break, here's a little something. 
[00:30:00]  Hey, man, let me in there first.  Go ahead, man.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  I really got to pee.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  There you go.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[00:31:30]  I'll be out in a minute.  Oh, my.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  I guess that makes us piss pals.  This is Bernie Getz.  Man, you better give me a 20 or something.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This one's for all the ladies out there.  You might want to save those moves.  I kissed you on the cheek.  Good night, my love, I say.  You turn to me and smile. 
[00:32:30]  A baby's on the way.  And then you drift asleep to dream of life anew.  And I lie wondering just what I should do.  I could kick you in the stomach and catch you unawares.  I could swear to God you accidentally fell that flight of stairs. 
[00:33:00]  When I tell you that I love you, I will look you in the eye.  As I slowly slide the hanger up your thigh.  I'm so sorry.  I can't believe I just said that. 
[00:33:30]  As I said, that one's for the ladies.  I'm so tired of these stereotypes we have of each other.  You know what I'm saying?  We're all the same.  You guys remember that teenage pregnancy commercial they used to play on the radio?  If you're a teenager and you're pregnant, you should go to the doctor early.  Or else the poor little guy, he might turn out bad.  I know all about it.  I'm Anna.  Like, Latinas are the only ones to get pregnant, huh? 
[00:34:00]  It couldn't have been Anna or Susie or Laquisha.  I'm Anna.  Chiclets.  Chiclets.  Chiclets al peso.  Chiclets al peso.  An entity.  XM202.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Yeah, I'm so tired of waiting.  Waiting for us too.  Wake up, wake up, wake up. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, I'm so sick of waiting.  For us to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  Come, we will never lose.  Wake up, wake up, wake up.  It's time to make a move.  Wake up, wake up, wake up  And we will never leave  Wake up, wake up, wake up  Make a move  That's some instant feedback here.  In the Dukes of Hazzard, if you were in a police chase  and you made it to the next county, they had to stop chasing you. 
[00:35:00]  And people actually believe that.  That if you cross the county line, you're free and clear.  And, you know, if a cop pulls you over and he's not wearing his hat,  he can't give you a ticket.  That's another one people actually believe.  That if he gets out, that he's technically out of uniform  and it's a loophole and he can't give you a ticket.  Yeah.  There you go.  Use that one in court.  All right, Anthony.  Well, the big...  You all have a good laugh. 
[00:35:30]  The big story today, the NHL hockey season was canceled and...  It was?  And no one cares.  Jimmy seems to be excited about it.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My chokes don't go over.  I don't care.  It's getting a lot of headlines today.  It's the big story.  But no one really cares.  Nobody cares.  I mean, I'm a season ticket holder for the New York Islanders.  I don't care.  I just don't care.  You know what it is?  It's not like people have been playing and watching hockey  and then all of a sudden they said,  well, we're taking hockey off. 
[00:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  So no one...  At this point, who gives a crap about hockey?  Yeah, they got some footage on ESPN right now  and they just showed a net on the ice.  Yeah.  And it's all dark except for the net.  Oh.  And then the light just fades to black.  Oh, how artistic.  Because the season has been canceled.  Yeah.  I don't even know what it's about.  I really don't.  I didn't follow the whole thing.  Oh, I hear it on...  They talk about it on 1010 Winds or something  at some of the news stations  and I listen and I have no clue where the problem was. 
[00:36:30]  It's something about money.  I'd be led to believe it's something to do with money.  They are so stupid.  Yep.  They are so stupid.  The NHL was really starting to take off  and now this is just going to really hurt them.  And they're already saying that this isn't an easy fix  and it may take another season of sitting out  to figure it all out.  What are the players doing?  Are they playing over in Europe or something?  That's what's...  I was talking to Earl actually at dinner about this. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  Did Earl pay?  He chipped in last night, sure.  He did?  I also said hi to John Macarone and his fine family  that was sitting right next to me.  Oh.  At my favorite restaurant.  I couldn't believe he...  I guess he likes the place too.  He eats McDonald's?  No, but Earl brought up a good point last night.  He goes, most of these guys are from Russia  and, you know, over there.  Uh-huh.  And there's all sorts of leagues to jump right into.  Yeah, that's what they're doing.  These guys are playing and, you know, whatever. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  I don't care.  I really don't care about it.  I don't care.  And I was a season ticket holder  and all I know is my tickets go up every year.  The prices are ridiculous.  They don't really care about the fans.  Do you get a refund or something?  I guess, yeah.  I have tickets with Joey from Paisanos and Mulberry Street.  So, we made a pact when the season was canceled.  You made a pact with Joey?  Oh, yeah.  Someday, you know, you might have to return that favor.  Joey and I might go into business together soon, Anthony. 
[00:38:00]  Uh-oh.  We may be going into some business together.  Oh, boy.  What are you going to call it?  90%, 10% in favor of him?  Incorporated?  That's good.  But, you know, we said we would...  Hope he doesn't care.  He opens up the place.  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Yeah, what do I know about...  I mean, I don't know about restaurant business.  I'm like, come and have a nice meal.  That's all I know.  We're thinking...  We're thinking...  We're thinking about some things.  Joey, your tab's getting a little high in here, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Bottle of crust, go ahead.  But, uh...  No, we decided as soon as they canceled the season,  we would do a real nice steak dinner  and maybe a strip club or something.  Yeah.  Just spend our money.  Spend the...  Yeah.  It is ridiculous, though.  The ticket prices are so out of hand to begin with  and they want sympathy from the fans.  You know, we're paying through the nose  to watch these guys play already  and, you know, they're not getting sympathy  from me or anyone else.  And you guys got to go to that crap hole 
[00:39:00]  Nassau Coliseum to watch games, too.  Yeah.  They were supposed to refurbish that whole place  and now, you know, forget about it.  Well, there's talks about it, but...  Yeah.  Now, forget it.  I mean, how many, you know...  Ooh, they're going to make a lot of money  on a Charlie Daniels concert?  What do they do over at the Nassau Coliseum?  It is...  Like, old hair bands perform there and hockey.  It's a shithole.  It really is a shithole.  I've been to other, you know, hockey...  What do they call the Coliseums? 
[00:39:30]  Arenas.  Arenas, I guess.  They're so much better everywhere else.  I got to tell you,  the baseball got hurt by the 94 strike.  Baseball really got hurt.  McGuire Sosa kind of brought interest back.  Thank God for steroids.  You know what?  I never came back to baseball.  You know, I tell people I'm a Mets fan.  I don't follow the Mets closely  like you guys follow the Yankees and stuff.  I'll take a peek here and there.  But after that strike,  I never came back fully.  I just didn't.  Well, it's kind of hard to follow the Mets, too.  All you got to do is look at the last place  in the division and there they are.  You're probably ahead of them. 
[00:40:00]  No, but I was a sports fan in general.  So, you know, I was really into baseball  and I would watch a lot of games and stuff.  But after that strike,  I never fully came back.  I just didn't.  And I know a lot of people did  with the McGuire Sosa thing.  But if it hurt baseball,  I'm saying it's definitely going to hurt hockey.  Because that was what really brought it back  was an amazing race.  If it hurt baseball,  it's really going to hurt hockey.  And I'm glad.  I hate hockey.  I hate hockey callers on the fan  when I'm trying to listen to sports talk.  Hey, Joe, the Rangers!  They're just dummies from Staten Island. 
[00:40:30]  So, good.  Sit home, idiots.  So, you know, it's making news today.  But in general,  this strike thing hasn't got much attention  from the sports fans.  And good luck to you.  Whatever.  Have fun.  Maybe next year.  I won't be going next year.  No.  No, you're not going to...  No, my season tickets are done now.  Done.  That's it?  Yeah, done.  You're not the only one.  Will I maybe go to a couple games next year?  Sure.  But now, you see what's going on here?  I had season tickets.  I'm dropping drastically down  to maybe a couple games.  And that's just to bring my little nephews and stuff 
[00:41:00]  because they really enjoy themselves.  Yeah.  But as far as, like, committing to a whole season,  done.  The league could be done.  Screw you guys.  A whole league could just be finished.  Well, that's what they're saying, too.  Wow.  You know what you do?  This is what I always say.  Spend your dollars elsewhere.  Hit them in the pocketbook.  In the pocketbook.  Hit them in the pocketbook.  I'll hit them in the pocketbook.  You know, it's...  I mean, the ticket prices just to go to a sporting event,  it just amazes me that they get away with this.  It just amazes me. 
[00:41:30]  It's ridiculous in all sports.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm saying.  To go to a goddamn game and watch.  But, you know, they've got to pay for these players somehow.  Yeah.  When the price of the players goes up, you know,  because that's what people want to see,  and that's what you're paying for.  Wow.  That's expensive, though.  Doing tickets, like, what?  I don't know how much is it, 30 bucks?  30?  I mean, for a lousy seat.  You know what I'm thinking about, a baseball game.  Hot dogs are, what, six bucks, and a beer or whatever,  a soda, the hush money for the kid.  I mean, it's just very expensive.  I haven't gone to 94. 
[00:42:00]  Or 90...  95, less than much.  No, it's hundreds of dollars.  It's hysterical when you go to the concession stand to buy stuff for your friends,  and you've got to come back with, like, six beers and six hot dogs and stuff,  and the person tells you how much it is.  You laugh.  Your head spins around.  You laugh.  It's like $130.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  It's like a six-pack of beer and some hot dogs.  Do you want the souvenir cup for another $4?  What? 
[00:42:30]  What?  It's not a souvenir cup.  It's a plastic cup.  It's a cup you should have given me this time.  Right.  It's a styrofoam cup with a logo on it.  You've got to sneak your own soda in using the Wizenator.  Drink out of your mule.  Yeah, that's the other thing they do.  They don't like you bringing your own food into these arenas.  Oh, how funny would that be to put the Wizenator on, fill it with something, lemonade,  and then have your son next to you.  Here you go, Vlad.  Make the kid drink right out of it.  It would be even funnier if it was something like that. 
[00:43:00]  It's thick and, like, dark, like a dark, like, cranberry juice.  So you look like you have internal bleeding to boost.  Go ahead, have a drink.  Daddy has a ruptured spleen, son.  Don't let that bother you.  I really get gross at making a milkshake.  Chocolate.  What?  We're watching the game.  Yeah, can't my kid have a little drink?  Nosy body.  Oh, man, is that funny. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, we've got a quick piece of audio here from WEEI.  I guess, yeah, that's the station in Boston, right?  The sports station in Boston.  And Terry Francona was on the air with WEEI.  And he gets into a car crash.  Listen to this.  Are there any in particular of the outfielders that intrigue you a little bit going in,  guys that potentially could come off the bench, give you some speed, that sort of thing?  Well, you know, we have the Adam Stern, the Rule 5 pick.  We've really got to keep an eye on him because we have to make a decision on him. 
[00:44:00]  Adam Heisdew, you know, is an interesting guy that we know a little bit.  You know, we have Gabe Payton here to be our fourth outfielder to kind of be the Gabe cap  or, oh, jeez, guys, I've got to go.  Somebody just rear-ended me.  See you, Terry.  You know what?  I have the Yankee logo, too.  Oh, see you, Terry.  Figures.  Okay, guys.  Oh, it's always about the Yankees.  Oh, it happens, you know.  Probably did it on, it's probably Steinbrenner driving. 
[00:44:30]  That's probably who it is.  Who knows?  I mean, we're talking to Terry Francona and somebody rear-ends him.  I hope he's not at fault.  I hope they don't have that cell phone down in the state of Florida.  He wasn't talking to us.  What are you talking about?  It wasn't me.  Oh, my God.  These guys were just handed a piece of what we call radio gold, and that's all they got?  That's all they got?  How about telling them, just keep the cell phone open?  Yeah.  I want to hear what's going on.  We would never let a guy hang up after that.  They're like, okay, hang up.  Okay. 
[00:45:00]  And the best they could do is, oh, he wasn't talking to us if he was on his cell phone.  The best they could do was a Pat from Wunaki impression.  Yeah.  Well.  What are you going to do?  Radio gold, and that's it.  Rare-ended.  Greek driver.  Well, what are you going to do?  10 minus 1 is 9.  Unbelievable.  And it's always about the Yankees.  Always about the Yankees.  Hey, hit him.  I had a Yankees ticket.  Ah, it's probably Steinbrenner.  Shut up.  Oh, I wish he was driving a Pinto. 
[00:45:30]  Bursting of flames.  I'm burning up over here.  I'm on fire.  Okay, we'll let you off.  We'll let you go, Raul.  He's burning.  Squealing you here is my phone melting.  Too bad they weren't interviewing Harry Chapin.  That would have been an interesting phone call.  Jeremy.  I'll call you back.  My skull is rolling.  Sorry.  Or Jane Mansfield.  Can I get back to you?  I'm a member of the Church of Satan, and I've been decapitated by a truck. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I'm filming a new movie.  Pook, you're the thud of the head.  See, it didn't even happen to us, and we came up with better stuff than they did.  Oh, jeez.  I've rear-ended.  Oh, wow.  Oh, shut up.  Jeremy, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I got choosing.  I had choosing tickets down in D.C., and they refunded my money, but kept a 5%, and they 
[00:46:30]  friggin' gave me tickets to go see Jim Norton at the Houston Improv, February 24th through  26th, 713-333-8800, or eatabullet.com.  Thank you, man.  That's very informative.  Thank you.  You know, I'm on to these guys, but they're coming from all over the freaking country.  I know the usual suspects at this point.  Oh, you do?  Oh, yeah, I do.  I'm not allowing Norton and friends to take over this program.  Todd the Trucker calls in.  You know what it's going to be. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, exactly.  He doesn't have to say Todd the Trucker.  Who knew it would come from Maryland today?  Scott from Iowa, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hi.  Hey, I just wanted to tell you guys, and like I said, I don't want it to be like a bad remark,  but you guys kind of remind me of the Bubba the Love Sponge show.  Wow.  Ow?  Why?  Why would you think?  Yeah, I can just barely hear you.  Why do you think we sound like Bubba?  I've never heard Bubba.  Do we sound fat?  I don't know.  Well, maybe because you guys like call it like you see it instead of all these other 
[00:47:30]  shows like the Bob and Tom show that's pre-Madonna's or something.  It's Iowa.  Oh, yeah.  It's Iowa.  All right.  I guess that's a compliment.  Thanks, Scott.  I never heard Bubba the Love Sponge.  I hear he's terrific, though.  I mean, just a terrific show.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  He's whatever.  Anyway, Anthony, on the way in today.  Yeah.  I was listening to the news, and they're talking about Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda.  Al-Qaeda is regrouping, and they're saying all over TV today that it's just a matter of time 
[00:48:00]  before they hit us again.  Well, we haven't had our dose of fear put into us lately.  If you've noticed, we haven't really had a good injection of fear from the administration.  So, it's kind of nice that they pumped this one out.  This guy has said nothing really new.  I mean, that underlying threat is there.  It's always been there.  But, you know, occasionally they've got to get on the news and let us know we're in mortal danger, 
[00:48:30]  and they are there to protect us.  Yeah, well, the latest is that, you know, they're regrouping, dirty bombs can be involved,  and possibly nukes.  They actually say it's just a matter of time before a terrorist organization uses a nuke.  Yeah, and then they say, most likely, initially, we will get car bombings here in this country.  Oh, really?  So, you know, I'm on my way in today.  I hear a little snippet, a little 30 seconds.  I'm thinking, man, I need to be a little more informed on this one.  Sure, sure.  You know, we do a national radio show now.  So, I ran up to the fifth floor here, and I got all the local New York papers, 
[00:49:00]  and on the front cover of the New York Post, I'm expecting the big headline,  Al-Qaeda, you know, gearing up to attack us with nukes.  Danger, something very shocking.  Well, the headline in the New York Post today, because it's so important,  Love Nest.  Love Nest.  Fifth Avenue hawks back home making babies.  Oh, good.  Isn't that great?  Where are our priorities in this freaking country? 
[00:49:30]  At least the hawks are back.  And they got a lovely picture of a hawk hovering over its nest.  Great.  Good.  That's nice.  You get into a car and see a truck next to you and think it might explode at any given  moment, but that's okay, as long as the hawks are okay.  That's more important to read about the hawks making babies than the possibility of Al-Qaeda  using nukes.  Uh-huh.  That's why I love this country and love doing this job. 
[00:50:00]  The hypocrisy, the ridiculousness out there.  Well, the Daily News must have covered it.  Well, um, yeah.  The headline there is from bust to flush.  Well, that is an odd story that you never do hear of.  A black guy who is up to his neck in bills won lotto.  On his way to, uh, the bank to declare bankruptcy.  To declare bankruptcy.  Wow.  A broke black guy won lotto.  Yeah, it's amazing.  It actually is a pretty cool story.  The guy is on his way to declare bankruptcy.  That's in the other paper. 
[00:50:30]  Hold on a second.  I'd rather see him win, though, than some doctor or dentist.  Doctors and dentists never win.  It's always an ethnic minority that's down on their luck.  That's cool, huh?  It always is.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm just saying it's a non-story.  Look at these Al-Qaeda faggots.  Fucking fags.  Oh, you showed them.  What?  Nothing.  That's just a line of dialogue for an audition I have.  I just wanted to see how organic I could make it.  An audition?  Well, yeah.  What are you auditioning for?  Louis C.K. has a pilot on HBO, and that was my opening line. 
[00:51:00]  Al-Qaeda?  Really?  Yeah.  What type of character?  This guy rich.  This dumb friend of his.  And what's the problem with Al-Qaeda?  I don't know.  They don't go any farther into it.  But that was just a line, and I just tied in with what Opie said.  I just don't have a chance to live with authenticity.  I had to try it.  Hit in the paper.  That was good.  Yep.  All right.  Here's the lotto story.  Lightning luck.  Debt was doing such a number on retired prison guard William Cosart  that he had made a 2.30 p.m. appointment for last Thursday to declare bankruptcy. 
[00:51:30]  Then, like a lightning bolt, the 54-year-old lotto player from Staten Island  got a call that morning that changed his plans.  I thought I was a bill collector, so I didn't answer the phone, he said yesterday with a laugh.  I'm in debt up to my neck.  Luckily, the lottery leaves messages.  And when the guy called back, he found out that he was the sole winner of a $30 million jackpot.  Jeepers.  Wow.  He was $200,000 in debt.  Wow.  $200,000 in debt.  In debt. 
[00:52:00]  This guy's going to blow through that in no time.  Oh, that's the best.  I love the broke lotto winners.  How big of a loser do you have to be to win lotto, multi-millions of dollars, and then lose it?  Gamblers.  Because any of these people that are, you know, this guy's $200,000 in debt, and he had nothing.  What was he running on?  A retired prison guard's salary?  And he ran up $200,000?  You know what he's going to do now?  You know what you have to do to run up $200,000 in debt? 
[00:52:30]  The average person.  I mean, the average person.  That's a lot of spending.  That's a lot of irresponsibility.  What are you doing?  What are you doing to bring up $200,000?  Maybe he was a gambler or something.  I don't know.  Gambling.  It didn't look like he was living the high life.  You know?  What do you do?  What do you spend that on?  I mean, when I first got some credit cards and stuff, I rang myself up into some pretty good debt.  But at least I had some, you know.  I went out and got, like, CD players and camcorders and things like that, you know. 
[00:53:00]  I was very irresponsible.  $20,000 in debt on my credit cards.  So, I guess I'm a little guilty of it, too.  Yeah, but that's only a tenth of what this guy.  Right.  Yeah, rang up, so.  But anyway.  All right.  Jimmy came in today really pissed off.  Just depressed.  Aw.  Went mad, but mad at myself.  We actually wanted to start the show with you today, but then we got sidetracked by the  Wizinator.  The Wizinator.  The picture's still over there just making me giggle, man. 
[00:53:30]  The fake penis.  But what happened?  A friend of mine, Katie, she's a comedian.  You remember we were walking to the diner one day, me, you, and somebody else after the  show, and this crazy chick just ran up to me like she was going to attack me and then  hug me?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's my friend, Katie.  She's a lunatic.  Yeah, she's nuts, but she's a comic.  She's actually very funny.  She's involved with Seeds of Peace, which is an organization which kind of puts Israeli  and Palestinian children together and teaches them to get along.  I know, but Clinton's involved with it, all these big politicians, and last year, Colin 
[00:54:00]  Quinn and I were raffled off as a prize at their dinner, a double date with me and Colin,  and actually two pretty hot sisters took it, and we went out and, of course, both struck  out horribly.  So this year, she's like, look, I got you on the red carpet for Seeds of Peace, and  I love Katie, but I'm like, I'm too tired.  I'm like, I'm really not into the organization too deep.  I just did this one thing.  I looked at the guest list, the special guest, no one was going to be there that I wanted  to see.  Of course, selfish me.  I get an email.  It's at seven something last night. 
[00:54:30]  Sorry, a train wreck on the news.  Wow.  Yeah, if you haven't seen the train wreck video yet, it's all over the news this morning.  What's the story with that?  We'll get back to that in a second.  This guy's wife was annoying him because she hung out with a fat friend who had a lisp,  and he just couldn't take it anymore.  The one I heard was right before that, the clip you don't see is Pat from Unaki telling  a joke.  With his little toe on the rail. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  It looked like a truck on the train tracks.  That's all I saw.  You don't know the story?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Sorry, John.  That's all right.  Ah, it's good.  This is really good breakfast.  I get a call from K to do the Caesar piece, and a red carpet would be kind of fun, but  I was kind of embarrassed because none of these people are going to know me on the red carpet,  so I'm going to traipse down the red carpet.  But no, I just saw this nightmare of me desperately looking and not one flashbulb going off.  Oh, yeah.  That's where the paparazzi take a break, and they put their cameras down and start looking 
[00:55:30]  at their watches and stuff.  Down the carpet further to see who's coming.  Yeah, right.  Somebody's publicist or the retarded child of somebody.  I didn't need that.  And you're walking with that wanting feeling.  Hi.  And I had no one to go with.  Hopping and wanting.  Oh.  I wouldn't even have a publicist or somebody to talk to to make it look like, look, let's  just pretend I'm not humiliated.  I'll continue on in.  I would have been by myself just looking around like I was scared of nothing.  One of the camera guys goes, Jim, and you look, and he goes, not you.  And I get an email. 
[00:56:00]  This was like 730.  I get an email at like 5 from her because I want to take a nap.  I'm tired.  Hey, look, Robert De Niro is going to be there tonight walking the red carpet.  Bobby De Niro?  Bobby in the VIP section.  Wow.  So I take my nap, and I go to the comedy cell that night, and I just remember that I talked  to Katie, so I have to call her.  I'm like, he didn't.  I wrote back.  I'm like, he certainly will not show up there.  I figure she's just busting my balls to get me to go.  Uh-huh.  He showed up, so I would have had a chance to walk the red carpet and hang out in VIP 
[00:56:30]  with Robert De Niro.  And maybe get that other shot.  Oh, I would have gotten it.  I'm almost sure I would have gotten it.  And Edie Falco and our old friend Louis Black showed up and a couple of other, Ron Silver,  other major celebrities showed up.  You would have gotten a lot of pictures.  In the VIP section with De Niro, and I decided to nap.  You were napping.  Now, this is the point I want to bring up.  You know, if that happened to you or I, we'd be like, oh, man, what a drag.  If I went, that would have been cool.  And then you and I would have been like, eh, oh, well.  Yeah.  It happens.  He didn't sleep last night. 
[00:57:00]  Dude, I am on probably an hour's sleep.  I was so angry at myself.  You were so pissed.  He obsessed about this all night long.  I'm such a...  It amazes me.  Why do you obsess, though, if you miss a shot?  I don't get that.  No, no, no.  Not if I miss a shot, because those little things happen.  It's because my decision-making caused it to happen again.  And I'm just...  I am such a zero on every level.  It just...  It happens like that.  Of course I didn't go.  Good job.  Yeah.  Just go home and nap, Stax.  I was...  That's a good one. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, you should have seen me when I heard I get up in my very tight little underwear.  Make the coffee to go.  Good one.  So, yeah, I blew it again.  I would have been in VIP, and I know I could have gotten it, because I already have a cover story planned to tell him now.  Really?  I won't blow it on the air.  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Something I know what I'm going to say.  Last time, I just tapped him.  He doesn't have XM.  You tapped him on the arm.  Oh, Bob.  Bob.  I'll tell you.  If I ever get it, I'll tell you.  No, try it out on us. 
[00:58:00]  No.  We'll help you through it.  Because the person that it involves, it will get back to them.  I'm telling you, it's a little involved, so I have to...  Oh, and he does what he's going to do.  Bobby De Niro is just going to open his arms and go,  Come here, you.  Oh, he'll take the picture.  Come here, you.  Not only will he take the picture, but he'll probably get his wife and go,  Grace, Grace, take a couple of shots.  And give his email so we can have one.  Take one for me, too.  Yeah, no, I just want to get that shot.  I was so unprepared the first time.  I should have told him I was a comedian and how much I love King of Comedy.  Once you're involved like that, they kind of take it with you.  But I just panicked.  I went, Bob.  Bob.  And I suffered. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Black Earl is online.  Oh.  Big celebrity checking in.  Earl.  Yo.  Earl, how you been?  Hello, guys.  How are you?  How much did you pay for dinner?  For your little...  What was it, lunch or dinner?  Dinner.  No, Earl, don't worry.  I told him you paid.  Earl, you paid?  Earl pays.  Well, Ben is very...  Well, Ben likes to...  Interested in this.  No, Ben likes to start trouble wherever he goes.  No.  Earl pays.  What's up, Earl? 
[00:59:00]  No, you guys called me.  What the hell are you in such a good mood for?  I'm not.  I'm not.  No, that's just my second line of dialogue.  Oh.  Very good.  Yeah, I just had to get that in there.  I thought you were just saying it.  No, very natural.  Did you enjoy dinner last night with John McEnroe, two tables away with his lovely family?  No, it was great.  It was really cool.  It was just an enjoyable, odd experience.  Because they were just...  For some reason, they were taking all the pictures. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  Wow.  Really, Earl?  You know, just figure with a celebrity in there, people will want to take their picture.  They're sitting there.  They're taking a lot of pictures.  You know, you make Pat from Monaki sound like Richard Pryor in 1974.  Earl, do you realize that the place was packed and no one even knew that that was John McEnroe and his family?  I wasn't even paying that much attention.  The only thing I noticed was that they were taking a lot of pictures.  That's the beauty of New York.  No one really cares.  They just don't care when they see celebrities.  Some of them don't. 
[01:00:00]  And they're too involved with their own whatever that they don't even notice things around them.  You know what I mean?  Well, yeah.  They're too obsessed with themselves to realize that there's big celebrities in the same restaurant with them.  Earl.  Earl?  Yes.  What are you doing for Black History Month?  I can hardly hear you.  What's wrong with the phones today?  I don't know.  Is that level raise?  Is that Ben raised?  Remember Ben raised one of those little buttons there?  I'm not touching anything. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, Ben.  Earl.  Yeah, it's like you guys are fading in and out.  Don't touch anything.  Don't touch anything.  Earl.  Yes.  Give your take on the gates in Central Park.  You had a very interesting twist last night.  No, I actually like the gates.  I think it just adds a little color to the park.  Oh.  And?  And?  I like it.  I mean, it's not the most original concept in the world, but I think it's kind of cool. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, it's not that original?  It's pretty original, Earl.  It's hacky, but it's original.  I can't really think of anything else that comes close to what this is, so I believe that means it's an original idea.  Well, I'll backtrack, and that's what I meant.  Are you trying to tell me there was another artist somewhere that did the exact same thing, but they used the color blue?  No, I'm not saying that at all.  I mean, I think I meant to say it was a little bit more. 
[01:01:30]  It's not.  Earl?  Yeah.  Hit the snooze alarm and call us back.  When was the last time you got laid?  There you go.  November 2001.  How big a while?  It's been a big while.  November 2001.  I got a hand job at a parlor about two weeks ago.  All right, Earl.  We're going to let you do it.  Hold on. 
[01:02:00]  Let me get one more line of this dialogue out.  I can't.  It doesn't all fit.  It doesn't all fit.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  All right, guys.  All right.  Got quite a few lines there.  Six pages of dialogue.  Six pages?  Yeah.  Nice.  That's why I kind of do the show and rehearse.  And this is an audition, though?  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  And you'll get it?  Louis is one of the guys doing a special.  No, of course I don't get it.  But, I mean, I love Louis.  He's hilarious.  So, I'm like, I'd be happy to welcome him.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we regroup?  Earl just, I don't know what Earl did.  That was Black History Month for us. 
[01:02:30]  I'll tell you what Earl did.  We were all having fun.  And Earl dropped prostate cancer on the floor in the middle of us.  And now we're all just kind of staring at it, waiting for someone to clean it up so we  could get the funny back into the show.  Anthony, yeah, there's a dominatrix story in the paper.  And I asked Norton if he knew this dominatrix, and he said yes.  Oh, he didn't miss a beat.  He went, oh, yeah, yeah.  So, we'll take a quick break, and we'll get into that story and other things next. 
[01:03:00]  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today?  It's a law of license.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready.  I'm ready.  I mean, I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.  Now, take a deep cleansing breath.  And begin.  I'm over here now. 
[01:03:30]  Nice cake, big.  Bag.  Bagget.  Guess who's back.  Oh, man.  Bag look it.  I don't believe it.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Bag look it.  Guess who's back.  Celebrate.  Get it off.  Hey.  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.  Turn it off.  Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. 
[01:04:00]  Get it off.  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now.  What's all doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  This looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little hope today, because it feels so itchy without me.  I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me, because we need a little hope today, because it feels so itchy without me.  Okay, cut.  Here we go.  Hold your ears, folks. 
[01:04:30]  It's showtime.  People being in the Anthony Show.  We've made it easier to get XM.  The XM Radio Online Store.

Well, we've got freshies out there again at Park City, Utah.  They've seen about two feet in the past two days there at Park City, and it certainly doesn't stop there. 
[01:05:30]  Mammoth in California with almost 20 inches just yesterday.  This weekend coming up is going to be a sweet one.  Hopefully, you've got a day off.  If not, I think you're getting sick, aren't you?  Sun Valley, Idaho enjoying all of their terrain.  So is Mount Bachelor in Oregon.  Jackson Hole, Wyoming with everything open.  Let's go over to the East Coast.  They've got a little fresh top coat as well at Whiteface, New York, and the Adirondacks.  Jiminy Peak, Massachusetts enjoying almost all of their terrain, getting ready for this holiday weekend.  Camelback in the Poconos.  Check out their half pipe on their lower Glade Park.  Sugar Mountain, North Carolina, all the way open. 
[01:06:00]  And in Vermont, Ocimo gets ready for the weekend with 14 lifts online.  I'm John Lewis with the XM Radio Ski and Snowboard Report.  It's everything 24-7.  XM 202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything all the time.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Soar.  Are you breathing?  Soar.  Are you breathing?  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[01:06:30]  The O.A. virus spreading across America.  Once again, I want to thank everyone that emails the program.  We read every single email. 
[01:07:00]  We just can't write everyone back anymore, and I apologize for that.  Also, if you want to send audio into the program, send it right to steve at foundrymusic.com.  I mean, you can CC me as well.  I like checking this stuff out, but get it to Steve immediately so you can get it on the program.  All right?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And then all the fan websites and all that.  Thanks, man.  Because this show will become huge.  That's right.  With or without the help from Washington.  This show will become huge. 
[01:07:30]  And they'll go, wow, I never realized how popular you guys were and how good the show was.  And we really didn't realize it was going to grow like it has.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Where is this dialogue taking place?  Huh?  Where is that dialogue taking place?  Oh, that's exactly what's going to happen.  Oh, you think people will say that to you?  Yeah, we don't get the support that we deserve from Washington.  We just don't.  We're out of sight, out of mind.  And we're doing our own thing.  And we're just not a priority within the company.  I'm convinced of that now.  We could be worldwide number one and we still wouldn't get the old. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, no.  No, I never knew you guys.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Their expectations for the show, I have learned, were a lot lower than ours.  You know, the numbers they wanted us to do by the end of 2004 stupefied me.  I'm like, you're kidding.  Stupefied.  I think we doubled that number that they wanted us to do.  Doubled it already.  So they had low expectations.  Yeah, what do you think brought that about?  And they continue to have low expectations.  You know? 
[01:08:30]  I don't like going through life like that.  We're going to...  With low expectations.  We're finally going to do our little marketing thing today.  You know, what?  We've only been on the air five months or something like that.  And we're finally doing...  We're back TV spots.  Yeah.  Ten-second TV spots, even though we were promised something a lot different.  And then they wonder why I get so pissed off and now refuse to even answer anyone's phone calls when they call me.  Oh, really?  You're not answering them again?  Not at all.  Because it's the same old horse shit, you know? 
[01:09:00]  But we've got to go in now after the show and do some voiceover work for a ten-second spot or...  Yeah, I mean, you know, we could have went to the little doggy company.  You know, we had to decide between the two companies.  And the thing that impressed me about XM was that they had their shit together.  And that they seemed to have a real good marketing strategy for you and I.  And I was very impressed.  You were very impressed.  We talked about it.  You know, we had a conversation about a 60-minute national TV commercial. 
[01:09:30]  Yep.  And finally, five months later, we're going to do, like, ten-second commercials that will air here and there.  Here and there.  And our part of it is five seconds of audio that we have to sit in a production room today and hash out with some production guy.  It's five seconds?  I think it's five, right?  Seven?  Maybe five, yeah.  Maybe five seconds.  I got confused about who's there.  And then they wonder why I get so, like, pissed off and livid.  Because, you know, I'm a good listener.  I listen to everything people tell me. 
[01:10:00]  And when you're telling Anthony and I that we're going to have a huge national campaign that we're back,  and then you blow us off over and over again,  and then finally you come to us with what was supposed to be this great marketing strategy for O5,  and it's ten-second commercials here and there, you know, do the math and figure out why we're, you know, disappointed, you know?  Did we get some copy?  No, after the show we're just going to kind of go into a studio with some guy that has to drive here from Boston or something they were saying.  Really? 
[01:10:30]  Just so we could sit there and riff and improvise on five seconds of audio.  So, we'll see how it comes together.  But it wasn't what we had promised.  Better talk fast.  You know?  We're going to have to just be, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But there you have it.  All you guys should do is curse.  Just be filthy in the audio.  Yeah, for a TV spot.  As dirty as you can possibly be.  Racist, sexist.  Drop the C word. 
[01:11:00]  Just take a clip from the show.  You know, it's also, we've also proven ourselves and, you know, it's time to just take us off this premium channel.  Oh.  And open us up to the whole platform.  Oh.  I mean, it's so obvious it's not even funny.  But, you know, we're still waiting and wondering what's going on with that, you know?  That should have happened day one.  Well, we'll see.  They had some reason why they couldn't do it.  I don't know.  It was just another stupid thing.  But we should have been on the whole service day one. 
[01:11:30]  I think they were afraid of you guys.  This show is one of those shows that you can't really explain it to people, you know?  And we don't have a big name like Howard, but we have a better show.  We have a better show.  And if you expose it to a lot of people, you know, guess what?  Hey, I would have never paid for you guys.  But, you know, I flip around.  Dude, I flip around XM every day.  And I'm finding new things every day.  And that's what's going to happen.  You get us off the premium and you've got hundreds of thousands of people out there that have no idea what we're all about. 
[01:12:00]  But if you have the service and all of a sudden you're bored with your regular station, whether it's Squiz or Ethel or Top Tracks or Deep Tracks or whatever,  all of a sudden you're going to stumble upon something we're doing.  And guess what?  Then that guy gets, you know, hooked.  You know?  He gets the virus.  That's why we call it the O&A virus.  And then know what happens?  Because we've seen this happen, Anthony and I.  That person will tell a few friends that don't even have XM about this new show that they're digging.  Guess what?  Next thing you know, those people are signing up for XM. 
[01:12:30]  And that's where, you know, they're going to make their money back.  Right.  You know what you guys should have said, though, in the meeting, if they didn't know how to sell you,  you should have said, just tell people we remind you of Bubba the Love Sponge.  Right.  Big selling.  There you go.  Just like the caller before.  Sure.  I think we'll hear things.  Well, we'll see.  I mean, you know, there's a lot of talk and just no action, in my opinion.  And I just don't think we're that much of a priority, you know?  We're just not. 
[01:13:00]  A lot of things are said when we go to Washington.  We're going to keep in touch more and this and that.  We don't keep in touch.  Nothing's going on.  You know, Elo could scribble all he wants on his, you know, his glass office.  But what does that mean in the end?  We're a little busy right now with baseball.  That's what I mean.  We're not a priority.  It's baseball now.  And then it'll be, you know, Gordon Liddy because, you know, he joined the team.  And then it'll be somebody else.  And, well, we'll get to you, but we have to now do this deal with what I was going to say with iPod. 
[01:13:30]  I have no idea.  I'm just saying.  You know, but there's always something else.  Always a deal going on.  There's always something else.  I think it'll all work out.  I'm actually in a positive mood today.  I am, too.  I'm feeling positive.  Oh, God damn.  Why are you?  He's going down on his banana.  Is that how you're expressing sarcasm today?  Isn't that the worst?  You've got teeth marks on it.  You give lousy head.  This is how I do it. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my God.  It takes a big bite.  I cough.  I would never eat a banana like that as people were watching.  We all turned and looked at Jimmy, and he just started giving fellatio with banana.  Because I know you hate eating a banana like that.  I hate eating a banana.  I have to unwrap it from its peel and then break off pieces of it and eat it that way.  I cannot shove it in my mouth like that.  Dude, somebody...  You just remind me of something. 
[01:14:30]  So, I mean, you know, I'm trying not to bitch about the XM, but we have a lot of passion in what we do.  You know, we really just have a lot of passion.  I mean, the good news from October 1st when we started to now, it's not even close how many more people are listening.  It's quite scary.  And if XM would do their part of the bargain, I think it would be even, I don't know, twice as many listeners that we have now.  I think things are going to happen.  Things have taken time, but you've also got to look at...  It takes forever. 
[01:15:00]  And this is what I'm feeling, whether it's right or wrong.  Anthony and I, we were on the top of our game two and a half years ago now when we got just knocked to the curb and lost everything.  We were syndicated in 20 cities, more or less.  I think it was a little less at that point.  But we had more cities that were jumping on the bandwagon.  They were going to syndicate the show right around the corner.  We lost it all.  Then we had to sit out two years.  And now, you know, we're impatient because we want to be back on top. 
[01:15:30]  You know, we've already waited two years, but in XM's world, they don't know that.  They only see that we've been on the job, you know, since October.  So, what, that's four, four and a half months.  So, they don't really understand the urgency in me.  I don't know if I could talk for Anthony, but the urgency in me to get back where we used to be, you know.  So, I want to push forward fast.  I don't...  Everything just seems to take forever.  Like a snail's pace.  It does.  That's every corporation, though.  It really is every corporation. 
[01:16:00]  When we worked for Infinity, there were similar issues as far as promotion and time and things like that.  Well, we didn't have the two years of sitting doing nothing in the back of our minds every single day.  Well, that's our problem, you know.  No, that's what I'm saying.  They don't understand that part of it.  They don't...  That's why...  That's why I get uptight.  That's why, you know, I want things done tomorrow.  Not a month from now.  Not two months from now, you know.  I look...  A lot of time has gone by since we've been here now, relatively speaking.  And, you know, I'm kind of happy with the fact that we do have our office. 
[01:16:30]  The shades were put in.  We have our equipment in there working.  For the most part, the equipment works.  The phone stuff from yesterday was setting problems.  That some jack fuck was coming in here and screwing with the dials.  You know, for the most part, the computer's pissing me off because, you know, this has to be fixed.  Steve Studios, right?  Yeah.  There are things they've done that are pretty good.  I'm...  You know, I'm not totally down on...  No, I'm not saying I'm down.  I'm not saying I'm down.  Well, I mean...  It just... 
[01:17:00]  It's that corporate...  It's not...  You know what it is?  I don't see it as this agenda to impede the show from continuing our success.  I see it as this is typical textbook corporate actions.  Well, they are...  Corporations stink.  And the way they run stinks.  They're not economical.  They're redundant.  And things take forever because it's got to run through 50 channels.  They don't listen to reason most of the time. 
[01:17:30]  But that's every corporation.  There is not one place we could go where we wouldn't encounter that.  It's interesting you bring that up because there was a time I was doing college radio.  I wasn't sure if I was going to make a go at this.  You know, I didn't know.  I mean, there's a million guys that wanted to, you know, get where Anthony and I are.  And they're all just selling cars and it's a really tough...  Hey, don't rub it in.  Well, it's a really tough business, but there was a time I worked for Xerox on the side because  I was, you know, good at, you know, computer programming, believe it or not, at first. 
[01:18:00]  And I got a taste of the corporate world and I said to myself, no effing way will I do  this for the rest of my life.  And I knew this when I was like 19 or 20 that I didn't want any part of it.  And I'd rather like just be a nomad or something.  I don't know.  A nomad.  Whatever.  I mean, I would...  Walk the earth.  Something.  And so, but then, you know, I lucked out and I got into radio and, you know, we got very  successful with it.  Thinking the whole time, you know, I'm doing what I love and I will never have to deal with 
[01:18:30]  the corporate bullshit.  But the further that we get along in our careers, it just amazes me that this stupid little thing  we do, this radio show and, you know, for many years just playing records and doing this  and that has gotten to this point where now we deal with human resources and people in  suits.  When I started radio, you know, yeah, there were guys in suits, but they were like the  suits they wore when they graduated, you know, high school.  You know what I mean?  To try to almost look good. 
[01:19:00]  But it's such a business now and it's so corporate.  That's it.  And I never thought in a million years it would get to this point.  It's big business.  A lot of money at stake.  So it's all corporate and it stinks.  The advantage is, though, there's a lot more money to be made and a lot more.  You're in every city in the country now, which is like back in years ago, that would have  been virtually impossible.  Dude, I understand the positives of why we're at XM.  I've said it.  You know, I'm having more fun in radio than I've ever had in my life.  You know, if XM needs us to kiss their ass so they feel better about themselves, fine. 
[01:19:30]  We'll do the kiss ass segment in a little while.  But, you know, I'm not about that.  You know, I tell the guys around here, you know, we're tough on these guys behind the  scenes, but, you know, we also tell them, you guys are here because you're the best at  what you do.  But if you need me to kiss your ass every day, then you're in the wrong place, you know?  We just want to keep, you know, making the show better and we're obsessed with being  the best.  We have a passion for this, you know?  Because they're all pissed off about yesterday and giving out Kevin's email and stuff. 
[01:20:00]  Relax, Kevin.  Yeah, it was funny.  You probably got some great feedback from a lot of the listeners.  You know, some dopes probably wrote stupid shit to you, but you can get over that.  You have thick skin.  It's an email.  You just delete.  Right.  I think, and don't email them anymore.  We made our point.  I think, if you look at, we gave out Ben's email address and Steve's and stuff.  I think it's pretty easy to figure out.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I think, I think that whole code that they're using as far as emails, pretty easy to figure. 
[01:20:30]  Ben didn't get mad when we tell him, look, if you want to talk about someone's fat hog,  ben.sparks at xmradio.com.  I'm not saying you should do that.  Right.  Who cares?  Ben doesn't mind.  But if you are inclined to write about his huge hog or his messy hair, feel free.  Because I talked to Ben, and he said, I dare those faggots to email me.  I'm like, Ben, you don't want to dare them because they will.  And he said, no, they won't.  Ben is like shaking his head in the office.  He's either shaking his head, that's what I was going to say, or he's hurricane and jerking. 
[01:21:00]  Either that or there's a blimp outside the window.  Why does Ben's head have Budweiser written?  No, he just grabbed his head with both hands and fell to the floor like, you idiot.  And now he's giving you the finger from across the way.  All right, so forget that.  Don't do that.  And especially don't put legitimate things in the subject heading, so he actually has  to open it and see you have a big hog, stupid.  Because if you do that, like, if you put a big hog in the thing, he'll just delete it.  Right.  But if you put legitimate things in the subject heading, poor Ben's going to have to open 
[01:21:30]  all these emails.  Yeah, so don't do that.  No way.  Even though he taunts the listeners and mocks them, you know, you shouldn't then, you  know, turn the other two.  Well, he raised a good point about how they don't have the balls to email him and they  wouldn't dare tangle with him.  All right, whatever, Ben.  You know what would be better for the listeners to do?  Just turn the other cheek.  Turn the other cheek.  Right.  Good point, Ed.  All right.  Well, let's move on, but, you know, I had to get that off my chest because I caught hell  from yesterday's little tirade. 
[01:22:00]  Tarad.  Tarad?  Tarad.  Jimmy, you know this dominatrix in the paper?  Yeah.  Scarlett Constance LeMay or something like that?  I don't know her last name.  I just knew her.  Actually, through friends, I met her.  Also known as Vampyra.  Is being sued by an ex-nanny?  I don't know the nanny.  So what?  She whips people during the day and while she's doing that, she's got a nanny taking care  of her kids at home or something?  I think she has one side and there's a nanny, I guess, apparently who takes care of the  kid.  She may be a dominatrix, but she claims to be the one feeling the pain. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, I get it.  Daily News is good.  Feeling the pain.  Enough with the jokes in the New York papers.  They're awful.  They're so witty.  Vampyra, when fronting her, she was slapped with a lawsuit by a former nanny who alleged  she was underpaid and abused.  The Vampyra denies the charges and says she's the victim of an extortion plot hatched by 
[01:23:00]  Brazilian immigrant Luzenda Lee Campos, whom she fired last year.  Probably right.  I am the victim here, says the dominatrix.  She is trying to take every penny she can from me.  She's trying to get back in me and ruin my life.  Do you notice that every sex trade person that winds up in the newspapers here, I somehow  know?  Yeah, that's what amazes me.  Jimmy, you know this woman?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What, you use her services? 
[01:23:30]  Well, I actually knew her through a friend and wound up maybe meeting once for, you know,  maybe.  Wait, what's the deal?  Because I was reading the rest of this.  Oh, I met her through a friend in other settings, I knew her through a buddy, and maybe we hung  out one time and there was Tinkle involved.  Maybe.  I'm not saying there was.  Oh, God.  Can I not speculate as to what may have happened, what may not have happened?  You're taking Tinkle from a mother.  She's a mother of a six-year-old son. 
[01:24:00]  How do you feel about yourself?  Thirsty.  Ugh.  So she came over to your pad?  I'm not saying that.  I'm not saying that at all.  I'm just saying that it could have happened in some alternate reality.  Ugh, I'm getting the heebie-jeebies.  Oh, you.  Don't be a silly goose.  I just don't see that as a fetish.  She's actually a nice girl.  So, is she?  Yeah.  Got a little chat before or after?  Oh, no, no.  I knew her before through another friend.  I had met her socially just as a person, talked to her and all that stuff, and she's very  nice, and I actually believe her, that this stupid Brazilian is probably extorting her. 
[01:24:30]  You know, you have these conversations with a girl like that, right?  And then you invite her over to maybe do something like Tinkle.  Do you think about what might be going on in her head?  No.  Because you had had a conversation.  It wasn't just like, she knocks on the door, here's two strangers, do this, and she's  like...  Like, do you think she might have gone, wow, he seemed like a nice guy when I was talking  with him, and now I'm squatting over him?  No, because I think that anybody who's a dom is comfortable with that and understands it. 
[01:25:00]  They talk to people all the time who would never acknowledge they have that side of them,  but they know that people do.  Do you understand what I mean?  It's like judges, cops, lawyers, all these guys, a lot of repressed married guys go to  doms.  I'm not like that.  I'm just open about it.  That's the only difference.  So I don't care who knows it.  Big deal.  If I was married, I'm sure I'd care.  But they talk to people all the time.  I've talked to people who appear so normal and nice, but I know, you know what I mean?  Yeah, but you would like to think she's so used to it and desensitized by it and doesn't 
[01:25:30]  really think that, but she's probably thinking, oh my God, what a freak.  Well, no, we didn't actually talk about it when we met socially, but I think that she's  probably into it, too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They don't look at themselves as freaks.  I don't look at myself as a freak.  I mean, a freak is a pedophile or a guy that bangs animals.  I mean, to me, that's like antisocial to a point.  Whatever you've got to say to get yourself to sleep at night.  Believe me, I will admit an asterisk here.  I've actually had this little dialogue with myself on the pillow as my nose was stuffed from  tears flowing down. 
[01:26:00]  You know how you're crying, you get stuffy?  You know, at least you're not touching children or animals.  Yeah, but where's the line, man?  I think everyone has, like, fetishes and whatever.  It has to turn me on.  No, I know.  I understand that, but I mean, where's the line where your fetish is normal, but, you  know, the pedophile and the bestiality thing, obviously, is...  Consenting adults.  Well, that's obviously wrong, but a lot of people would say a dominatrix taking a leak  on you is way out there and wrong, too, though.  It is out there.  I'm not going to say it's wrong, but it's something out there.  Most fetishes are, like, foot fetish. 
[01:26:30]  I like big-breasted women.  That's the standard.  Sure.  I like a little spanking, you know, that type of thing, and you're way over to this side.  Well, believe me.  And you're trying to say that's as normal as foot fetish?  No.  No, not as normal.  Foot fetish is much more accepted because it's seen as a cleaner thing, but no, it's not  normal.  The norm...  The foot fetish thing, I don't get it.  Me neither.  I think it's deeply disturbing.  Yeah.  Someone saw little mommy's tootsies when they were a little boy.  They were playing in the kitchen, and there were mommy's painted toes, and they got confused 
[01:27:00]  at the little bump in their undershorts, and it became that naughtiness.  Is that where that comes from?  I believe so, because it's submission.  The foot is a low part of a person.  I mean, even the Bible, Christ washes the feet of the beggar.  Yeah.  You wash that foot.  Yeah.  Yeah, wash all nine of those toes.  Thanks, Lord.  Jesus.  Yeah, you can knock off a little early.  Nine toes.  You're going to be hanging around?  So, I think... 
[01:27:30]  I don't know where fetish comes from.  Maybe you get bored.  I get bored a lot of times.  It's very hard to turn on sex.  You get bored, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, bored.  Yeah, but I think everyone has a fetish, if you really asked every person.  I don't have a foot fetish, but, like, nasty feet disgust me.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, but nasty feet turn me off.  No, that's, like, big nasty long claw toes and gnarly things.  Ugh.  Like, that's really rank, and that could ruin things, you know.  You don't have any fetishes, though. 
[01:28:00]  Like, you're pretty, like, normal.  Like, you just, like...  I bet you...  I mean, it's not going to, like, share, but I bet you if we talked to him long enough,  he would tell us something.  A fetish?  I think every person has some kind of fetish.  I'll be honest.  I'm trying to think.  A fetish is more of a non-sexual thing that you sexualize.  So, liking big breasts is not really a fetish.  It can be a preference.  But I think, you know, like, you know, tinkle or feet are non-sexual things that are being  sexualized.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, that's, like, wearing panties, which has never been a fetish of mine.  Oh, I did it with one girl I dated once. 
[01:28:30]  One night, I put it on.  Would you?  Would you?  You put on some panties?  Yeah, I'll tell you what happened.  Oh, my God.  What she used to do, this is a long time ago.  Wait, can we regroup for a second?  What?  I'm trying to tell you.  You just throw that out like it's no big deal.  It's not.  Would you?  It's not.  Fuck me.  Can I help you back?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  I love that one. 
[01:29:00]  Audio of the girl.  Hey, are you about a size 14?  Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Sure.  No.  I, um, was seeing this one girl, and you know how that was.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told.  I was wearing the girl suit.  Will you go ahead and tell you the story?  I, um, well, she used to, uh...  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again.  God.  Rrr.  I can't. 
[01:29:30]  I have to hear the next one.  I know.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  In the basket!  He's just so exasperated with her, her tardiness with the lotion, her questions.  Oh, yeah.  Why, why isn't that lotion in the basket and in my hand right now?  Doesn't want to humanize her.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket!  In the basket!  Keep mentioning her name is Catherine.  That's smart.  Orgy?  Orgy?  In the bag!  In the basket!  All right, so...  Lotion!  I was, um, seeing this one girl who, I, again, I like, uh, you know, some golden shower, 
[01:30:00]  and, uh, she would tinkle in her panties for me.  Oh.  And, uh, yeah, it was kind of...  Not a lot, just a dribble, just to wet it, and, uh, I would...  Wow, that's some control shit.  Yeah, yeah, she was a good egg.  And, um, you know, it was kind of hot.  And, uh, so she would do this for me, and I'd go down on it.  It was really nasty.  And then one time, she actually liked guys to put on panties,  because she liked the way a guy's mule looked in panties.  Uh-huh.  Um, and one time she wet her panties, and she asked me if I'd put them on.  I said, yeah, so I did, and I stood up, and she gave me a Hummer through the panties. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  After she had wet them.  It was one of the dirtiest things.  That is filthy.  I have never had a rod like that.  To see her doing...  Because it did, like, when you put them on, your mule looks monstrous.  Like, you know, the thing that was built just can't contain it.  And the fact that she had done that first in them, and then was like...  And she was so turned on doing it.  Because we both realized this is so a step beyond the perversion we had engaged in. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know, boom, pulled them down and finished me off.  But that was one of the most turned on I've ever been.  But I never did it again.  It just wasn't a thing for me.  It's not a fetish.  I don't feel it's naughty underwear thing.  But at that moment, it was a complete turn on.  Why not?  Dude, it was hot.  She grabbed it after she had wet it, and I put them on, and she was just all over it.  Wow.  I've never been packing like that in my life.  It must have been some scene. 
[01:31:30]  It was fantastic.  You continue to amaze me.  Why?  That was great.  Just when I thought I've heard every story.  What the fucking lotion in the basket?  That wasn't that bad.  That's not that bad.  Mmm.  Well.  Silky, all nice and silky.  Yeah.  They weren't granny underwear, were they?  No, no, no.  They were regular.  They weren't her period panties either.  They were just regular ones.  All right.  Well, that makes it okay, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  They were hot little panties.  Yeah.  Let's go to Josh in Wisconsin.  Wait, did I blow that relationship?  Josh.  Dope.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys? 
[01:32:00]  You guys rock.  All right.  What's up, Josh?  Jimmy, dude, I just got to say, man, you killed in Chicago when you were out here, man.  You were awesome.  Oh, thanks for coming, man.  I appreciate it.  Anyway, I'm just calling out.  Yeah, you know, I'm an ass, man.  You know, most guys, they're either a tip man or a leg man.  I'm an ass, man.  And what I used to do with my ex-girlfriend is I'd go in her bathroom, and I'd go through  her clothes hamper, and I'd just smell all of her dirty underwear.  That's, um, so you like, like, an ass in your face, right?  Not just, like, not just anal sex, but, like, the smell of an ass in your face. 
[01:32:30]  Well, yeah, you know, I like that, and I just, I like how, you know, a perfectly shaped  ass and just things like that, you know?  Oh, yeah.  I blame you, dude.  I completely relate.  Hey, man, we all, we all love it.  Punch it out.  We all love the ass, but the, uh...  It's got to be, there's a smell of an ass.  Let's clear this up here.  That's, that's, that's some touchy, uh, touchy ground there.  There is a fine line.  It can be, if it's rank, it makes me want to retch.  It's gross.  There's nothing worse than an ass that smells like an armpit, or one that smells like, uh,  like, uh, yeah, there's some brutal ones, but, you know, a nice, if it's clean, and there's 
[01:33:00]  hygiene, it's very sexy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Uh, let's go to Freak Show.  Freak Show.  Hey, I can't believe Anthony's giving, giving Norton a hard time when he's got a thing for  pregnant women.  You know, you want to have sex with a baby, with a woman with a baby three inches away.  That's true.  Well...  No, no, I don't want to have sex with, uh, pregnant women.  I do not.  I, I find it to be a, a turn-on, though, yes.  Wow.  So you're turned on by a woman with...  Yeah, but I don't want to have sex with some...  The man just wants to bite a pee on them. 
[01:33:30]  I don't want to have sex with some lady that's carrying some, you know, other dude's baby.  No.  And, guys, you really are having trouble with the phones.  You're fading in and out real bad.  All right.  Well, no, I, I mean, I, I think, uh, pregnant woman is, uh, very sexy, though.  Damn.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Not a thing for me.  I don't think it's awful, either.  Well, she's got to be hot.  Two.  She can't be a fat mess.  I really don't think about it.  Let's go to Brett.  Hey, Brett.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say, perversion can actually be viewed as going hand-in-hand with complexity 
[01:34:00]  and intelligence, because if you look at the more advanced societies like Japan and Germany  and, you know, really advanced, sophisticated, intelligent people, and you look at the disgusting,  fucking depraved shit that's coming out of those countries, and that's considered normal,  and then, by contrast, you look at something like an African Bushman or just some primitive  Peruvian, all they want is a big, fat chick.  All the guys in Germany like all this fucking enema-ass porn and the Japanese with the bukkake. 
[01:34:30]  You're trying to say, uh, they're more intelligent in Germany than, than here in the United States?  No, no, he's saying that this, he's saying as opposed to other cultures where they just  put it in and knock them up.  Right.  But I, I understand what you're saying, but I think that's more based in repression.  Like, Japan is a very repressed society.  Yeah, and boredom.  And boredom.  Boredom?  Well, Japan, I'm saying, is very sexually repressed.  Like, you know how, like, they're, they're very proper, and they're very, very strict,  and they're very discipline-driven, so that's their chance to be really, like, you know  what I mean?  It's almost like, uh, guys that are really dominant tend to be submissive, and women 
[01:35:00]  that are real bitches in the office and run the thing want to be spanked.  It just, it's, it's like that, that, that vent, it seems.  Yep.  Well, I made my point.  You get the idea.  Yeah, yeah, no, I don't even disagree with it.  I just think it, I don't know if that ties in as well.  So, all right, let's go to, uh, Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Matt, that just reminded me of, uh, this story one time.  Uh, this, this girl actually took her dripping panties off in the middle of it, had put 
[01:35:30]  them over my face while she was, and then she started blowing me, and it was the craziest  thing.  Did you like it?  Yeah, yeah.  And what made it even better was she, uh, just when I was about to come, she pulled the  panties off my face, she looks me right in the eye, and she goes, if you want me to  make you come, you have to take me to see Jim Norton.  I, you know something?  I knew he was going there.  His whole setup didn't work.  I had a feeling, too.  I knew he was going to go there.  You only get one a day, Jimmy. 
[01:36:00]  No, that's not right.  Unless it's a really good one.  You know, if it's clever, some guy already did it this morning.  That might have been true, though.  You gotta let him finish the story, because he might be telling the truth.  A woman might have said that to him.  A woman might have said, uh, go see Jim Norton.  I put on panties and got a Hummer, why can't she want to come hearing about the improv?  That's what she was saying.  Who knows if she was saying the Boston Comedy Connection, April 8th and 9th, tickets on  sale now.  Could have been that, too.  The Borgata in Atlantic City.  Do you listen to the, uh, April 16th.  Do you listen to the replays of this show? 
[01:36:30]  Sometimes.  They are playing your commercial every break.  Don't worry, you're getting your mentions.  I know.  It's nice of them to do.  Every break, you hear, hi, Jim Norton here.  I'm very good.  Jackson, Texas, whatever.  I like the ones that blindside me.  That one I saw coming.  Kind of, because he was a little nervous.  All right.  Keith, let's go.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hi, Keith.  And first, I just wanted to say what you were talking about yesterday real quick.  XM is getting all of my money solely for you guys.  Well, there's a lot of people that got the service because of us so far. 
[01:37:00]  But, uh, I was telling the guy who answers the phone, yeah, my fetish is, uh, I look for  porn where black guys are fucking fat white chicks, but I like the ones where they do  the vaginal cum shots and they come inside them.  Cream pies.  Yeah.  Cream pies.  What's a cream pie?  What?  When you finish internally.  It's an internal pop.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The money shot seems to be the closer.  Yeah, but it's black, specifically black guys fucking fat white chicks.  Not regular white chicks, but fat white chicks. 
[01:37:30]  What does your mom look like?  I'm not even kidding.  Jimmy's an expert.  I'm not.  I just say, you never know.  I mean, we're all, I'm not even being, is your mom fat?  No.  All right, because that could be a hatred of mommy.  Ooh, really?  To watch her railed by young criminals.  You never know.  You know, I gotta bring it up again, one of the hottest movie scenes ever was the black  drug dealer banging Julia Stiles.  That was not hot!  No, that wasn't hot.  In traffic.  That was disturbing.  That was disturbing.  That was disturbing.  That was unhot!  That was beyond hot. 
[01:38:00]  God damn, what is wrong with you?  And I was discussing that with my brother at Mardi Gras, and he's, he's with me.  What is wrong with you?  My brother Brett thinks it's one of the hottest scenes ever, too.  What's hot about it?  Huh?  What, what, what, Keith?  Take me out of the car crash.  I gotta go.  No, you did fine.  No, I don't think that, that disturbed me.  Oh, what's wrong with you?  She was a well-to-do girl from the suburbs, nice family, and her addiction was so bad  that she was in like a crack den, and this is what she had to do to get her drugs. 
[01:38:30]  That's disturbing, not hot.  I picture someone I love having to do that.  It's like, ugh, it just creeped me out, dude.  Oh, oof.  Creeped me out.  It was, I'm telling you, man.  I don't know what it is, but it was hot.  Oh, my God.  Is that, ugh.  And the father's just so close to finding her, but, but just missing.  The dad's nightmare.  Oh, the father's nightmare.  Yeah, that's so disturbing.  I have a fine line of what turns me on, but whenever it seems like someone's truly being 
[01:39:00]  victimized, it just like creeps me out.  Yeah, that doesn't work for me at all.  She wasn't being victimized.  Victimization.  In the end, she was getting her drugs.  Oh, Jesus.  I know that.  And she volunteered.  She showed up.  He didn't put a gun to her.  She showed up.  She was in her drug euphoria.  That's victimized.  And there you have it.  Did you guys see another drug movie, which was Requiem for a Dream?  No.  That movie disturbed me so much, I had to walk around my apartment for a half hour.  It was with Ellen Burstyn, who was phenomenal. 
[01:39:30]  And there's one scene in there where it's about doing drugs, and the guy gets in jail,  and he's got gangrene on his arm from shooting dope.  And who else was in that?  One of the Waynes brothers was, I think it was Marlon, was great in that.  And the girlfriend of his goes to see, who was the black guy?  It was, what's that?  No, no, no, no, no.  From Platoon, his name is the same.  Keith David, David Keith.  One is white, one is black.  Like, the one from Platoon, the black guy, plays a drug dealer, and the girls, he'll  only, like, give the girls money, like, give the girls dope if they come over, like, give 
[01:40:00]  him a hummer or do a dildo show in front of a group full of guys.  And she was going over to his house and seeing him, and it was just so disturbing.  Because you can picture your girlfriend or someone you love having to do that.  It's just awful.  Damn.  Yeah, that is just, you know, go ahead, call me prejudice.  No, no, anybody, even if it was a white drug, it just would have annoyed me that somebody  had to do that.  The other movie that had that hot scene was with, what was it, Meg Tilly, where she was  banging the dude while her boyfriend or husband was tied up in the other room watching. 
[01:40:30]  That was hot.  That was really hot.  How do you love those victim movies?  That movie sucked.  What was it called?  Runaway or something like that?  Yeah.  Because the guy was the victim in that one.  Yeah.  And she was volunteering to bang.  Yeah, all of a sudden she fell in love with her kidnapper or whatever, and then they're  banging, and the guy's tied up in the other room, and they kind of, they left the door  open for a while, and then they closed it and said, you pervert, stop looking, or something  like that to the guy. 
[01:41:00]  Oh.  Something about that scene, too, man.  That's really bad stuff.  Let's go to Shit Dick Killer from Whack Bags.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's up, y'all?  I got to tell you, man, the hottest love scene I've seen in a movie had to be the racist  Billy Bob Thornton just anal banging Halle Berry in Monster's Ball.  How was it going?  Yeah.  Was he doing the poop shoot, though?  No.  No, but he's just...  I think at one point he was.  See, black guys didn't like watching that, either. 
[01:41:30]  Really?  I bet you they didn't.  Black guys did not enjoy that scene.  Yeah.  Good.  Welcome to our awful lives.  Yeah, why did they start banging?  There was a desperation in that one, too, right?  Yeah.  Well, her son, Patrice, had been killed on the side of the road.  No.  What?  Well, it was a fat kid, yeah.  Oh, it was?  Oh, that's what it was.  I just saw the sex scene.  I didn't see that one.  It was a mother that lost her son.  Oh, he's a big fat dummy, and they're walking in the rain, and you hear a thud, and you hear  her, like, scream. 
[01:42:00]  And the next thing you know, you've got Billy Bob Thornton just banging her.  Yeah.  Puffy Combs was in that.  Sean, P. Diddy.  Doesn't she look at him and just go, F me?  I don't remember.  She's just like, yeah.  F me on the couch.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, she just looks at me.  Looks at me.  Jesus.  I wish.  Looks at Billy Bob and says, F me.  And I just saw that sex scene.  Like, the clip of the sex.  It's a great sex scene.  You ever see the one from Brown Bunny?  The Hummer?  That is really sexy. 
[01:42:30]  What's his name?  Vincent Gallo gets a hardcore Hummer.  Oh, yeah.  They talk about that.  I didn't see that one.  It was such a hot scene.  Yeah?  Yeah, because it's real.  I mean, that's exactly what a guy is like when he's getting a Hummer.  It wasn't any of that, you know, porn overdone stuff.  Best Hummer scene was Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone at Casino.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  You need a sponsor?  No.  She had no choice. 
[01:43:00]  It was just like.  She's crying.  Okay.  I'm nodding.  I love when he's talking about veal and he gets in the car and he just grabs the girl's  head and she drops her head in his lap.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, I'm just recognizing, like, your hatred of Noah's boots the other day and the throwing  of fruit at it and the enjoyment you get out of this rich chick getting railed by the drug  dealer.  Oh, it's another one.  Ah, good tie-in. 
[01:43:30]  Maybe it's the fact that the girl is rich in the movie.  Yep.  Yeah.  Good point.  Did you hear Ope say he likes when the drug dealer grabs the rich girl and throws her  nice packaged lunch on the floor and steps on it?  What is that scene from?  Brown Bunny, Chloe Sevigny.  Where'd you find the still shots of the BJ scene?  I heard William Morris dropped her for this.  Jesus, she's actually doing it.  That's what I'm saying.  It was a hardcore scene.  Shot in Europe.  It was really sexy.  Did he finish? 
[01:44:00]  I think he did in her mouth.  Money shot?  No, no, no, no.  That's what was great about it.  It was for real.  And I believe that William Morris was her agency and they dropped her if she agreed to do the  scene.  Wait, if people are at home at their computers, they've got to see how hot this is, man.  Dude, that was a sexy scene.  Where can you find this, Eric?  With a video.  Nitrovideo.com.  Nitrovideo.com.  And look, Steve's already in here.  Don't worry.  It'll be up on foundrymusic.com.  Nitrovideo.com.  No, it won't.  I need the hits on my website.  No, no, no.  I ain't posting this, but I'll post a link.  You can get it on Mr. Skin, too.  You can also, couldn't you also go Google, like, Brown Bunny, oral scene or whatever? 
[01:44:30]  Maybe.  Yeah, Google it, because the video is very sexy.  Why would she agree to that?  I don't know.  Why not?  Really?  I mean, you know, probably what she had to do to get the part to begin with, so why  not roll the camera?  What other movies was she in?  Oh, that was at the time.  Gallow was Chloe Sevigny's boyfriend.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  And that's why she did it.  Oh, I didn't know that.  I think you're right about William Morris dropping her, though.  That takes away some of the hotness for me.  I thought it was just an actress.  I didn't realize that they were actually dating. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, let's go to John in New York City.  John?  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Remember the movie Kids?  I didn't see it.  I didn't see that either.  Colby, what the hell his name is?  Colby?  You got bang.  Ten ways to heaven on that one, man.  There's a couple of good ones.  They're all like 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds host me, at least.  All right.  Yes.  John, I got a bell on you.  Your phone stinks.  Sorry, John.  Probably a good point to take a break.  I guess we should play one of our favorite things as we go to break in honor of Jim's 
[01:45:30]  little...  Oh, one more sex scene that I thought was really a good one.  And you actually were the one that turned me on to this movie.  Oh, Swimming Pool?  Yeah.  Swimming Pool?  I love that movie.  Everyone loves that movie.  I didn't see it.  Oh, my God.  It's about some chick and...  Dude, it's the hottest movie you could see.  Oh, my God.  I don't even remember what the story was. 
[01:46:00]  It's a writer.  It's an old writer.  And she has a writer's block.  So she goes to, I think, her book agent's, like, kind of slash villa mansion type thing.  Yeah, kind of away from it all.  In the country to think and try to come up with this next novel.  Yeah.  And then you're not really sure if she's imagining all this stuff that's going on with  the agent's daughter.  Yeah.  So then the agent's daughter shows up at the house unexpectedly, and she's supposed  to be how old?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Move the cursor.  Can I see that?  There it is. 
[01:46:30]  Look at this chick.  She's supposed to be 17.  This chick is the hottest girl out there, man.  And she brings home guys from the bars and just has sex with them.  And the woman, this old prudy writer, has to listen to them having sex.  Yeah.  As she's trying to write her novel.  Swimming Pool?  Yeah.  Oh, look.  Did you take a look at her?  Look how hot this girl is.  She really is sexy.  I mean, this movie is sexy.  Who's the blonde with her?  Oh, that's the old school marm.  That's the old lady.  And then later on in the movie, she gets completely naked. 
[01:47:00]  Any more of those?  Yeah.  But, yeah, if you haven't seen Swimming Pool, I don't know if it's a good movie.  There's just some really great hot scenes in there.  She bashes the one guy with a brick.  Oh, nice.  There she is, taking everything off.  Yeah, she's completely nude with a big rock and committing a murder.  But that was a hot sex scene.  Her having sex with the guy she brought home from the bar.  Pretty good stuff.  Keep that website up during the commercial.  Before you go to commercial. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, she's, yeah.  Yeah, that's the scene where she's in the pool, up to her ass in water.  A guy is sitting on the edge of the pool, and she's giving him a hummer.  Yeah, good stuff.  You want to talk about disturbing scenes.  Hands down, the most disturbing sex scene I've ever seen.  It's in a French movie called Irreversible.  Oh, someone's got that on the line.  Go ahead.  There is a rape scene in that movie.  It is so disturbing. 
[01:48:00]  Really?  It is such an upsetting scene, man.  It's brilliant.  It's brutal.  And it's an absolutely, I guarantee you that's what a real rape looks like.  I haven't seen that.  It's French, and the movie, Irreversible, kind of goes backwards.  It's a really weird film, but it's good.  It's a stupid French movie.  Nah, but it's a really interesting movie.  I do, too.  They stink.  And if an American had raped this girl, it wouldn't have been as bad, but it was a French  on French, so I kind of felt like, you know.  But it was such an awful scene.  With the guy in a Nazi uniform, just raping her. 
[01:48:30]  Nah, that would have been kind of hot, actually.  Clothed in a French flag.  Would have been good.  A little subtle.  Sick F is on the line.  Sick F.  Yo.  What's up, buddy?  Do you guys remember that really, really delicate scene?  I mean, it wasn't that hardcore as some of the ones you're talking about, but in 8mm?  I didn't see it.  8mm.  Yeah.  Nicholas Cage, right?  Yeah, I saw that one a while ago.  I thought you were going to talk about Devil's Advocate.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's just for the call screen.  No, there was a delicate scene in 8mm where the guy is chopping the fucking girl into little 
[01:49:00]  bits.  That was kind of cute.  I hated 8mm.  That could have been a really good...  No, that was just to get through the phone screener.  Oh, great.  8mm could have been a good movie if it didn't star Nicholas Cage doing the exact same acting  that he does in every other movie.  Dude, I was never a fan of his.  I liked him in Leaving Las Vegas.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  What was the Vegas movie?  Was it Leaving Las...  No, no, no, no.  Was it where he plays an alcoholic?  Yeah.  It was Leaving Las Vegas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's right.  But he plays... 
[01:49:30]  He acts the same way in every movie, whether it's a comedy or...  Yeah.  I had enough with Nicholas Cage.  Like Coppola's nephew.  That's how he acts.  He was good in Valley Girl with Deborah Foreman, though.  That was a fine one from the 80s.  I had a big crush on her.  Rich in Philly.  I love the cooler.  I don't remember the hot scene in that.  You don't remember that scene?  The one with William H. Macy?  I saw it recently.  What's the scene?  He has sex with a young girl, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  A couple times.  They even show his nice little old ass.  With the girl?  With the hooker girl or whatever she was?  With the girl that used to be on ER.  She's not hot.  She had an awful ass.  There's a scene where they're both on their...  I was talking about him.  All right.  There's a scene where they're both on their knees,  like, making sounds to annoy the people in the next motel room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And her ass is horrid.  They show it from behind. 
[01:50:30]  It's this saggy, like, nasty ass.  She wasn't hot.  She had bad tits.  She wasn't really that hot.  It was a good movie, but not for that.  All right.  Why don't we take a break with one of our faves  from Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  Every time we play this, the email goes nuts.  People want to know where you can get this thing.  I guess it's up on foundrymusic.com or opiananthony.com.  Or do a search.  It's Silence of the Lambs, the musical by the Kaplan Brothers.  I bought two.  You bought two of these?  Yeah.  Why? 
[01:51:00]  Bought for a friend and just to have one around the house.  Are there any other tracks on here worth playing?  Have you tracked through the whole thing yet?  Yeah.  You know, I got to get used to them, though.  The ones we play are really the hits.  The hits?  Yeah.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket to the one, man.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing, a simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket. 
[01:51:30]  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been. 
[01:52:00]  Most of you, so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining, so.  Right down before I jam a ball, right down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny. 
[01:52:30]  Cops are sure to send somebody.  And turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  The last girl climbed halfway by the asteroid.  The last girl climbed halfway apart.  The last girl climbed halfway by the asteroid. 
[01:53:00]  He's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  I'd kill you but there's someone at the door  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you  It's a waste of skin, they don't sell bad girls in a fucking store  Put my fucking precious in the basket  Don't you hurt my one and only friend  You don't know what pain is but I'll teach you it 
[01:53:30]  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head  Put the fucking poodle in the basket  Let's do it!  The OPNM News Show  We're jealous of women sexually, women have that superior endurance  What's the biggest difference sexually? It's the energy levels right after sex  Girls get all energetic, my girlfriend wants to cook stuff  She's got a cake in the oven, she's roasting a pig on a spit 
[01:54:00]  That she killed with her own bare hands  You know, she's painting the house, raking leaves  Meanwhile I'm at the hospital, my blood pressure is 3 over 1  I'm on life support systems  The doctor's like, he came 3 times?  That means irreversible brain damage  Guys have no energy after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists don't get caught every time  So officer, how'd you apprehend the suspect? 
[01:54:30]  Well he chased him 50 feet and he passed out  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods doing jumping jacks  After I have sex, my legs are like a newborn calf  You know, I'm in the kitchen in my underwear  Trying to make a sandwich  Look out the window, she's put in a built-in pool  Yeah, is it 80 feet deep enough, honey?  What did I shoot into, you?  Cracks?  Sit down for crying out  We'll have sex tomorrow night and clean the garage 
[01:55:00]  You know what I mean?  After a good blowjob, I need a walker  Only one thing got me out of college  High school  That high school was tough  And grammar school, I couldn't spell at all  I used to miss words like posse

[01:58:30]  Yep  We should play that U2 song  Going into break next  It didn't have any  Any buzz to it  The Grammys  Like the Oscars have this buzz  Because of Chris Rock  You know  And everyone's going to tune in now  To see how outrageous  He's going to be  But the Grammys  No one cared  Did anyone know who hosted it?  No  I think it's because  The VMAs have taken off  Yeah  That they can't really compare  You know  The Grammys to the VMAs  Even though  Like they made the Grammys  A bit hipper  But the VMAs  Are so over the top  And stuff  That I think 
[01:59:00]  You know  It fails in comparison  I just think  There's too many  Award shows now anyway  You know  Every other week  There's an award show on  Who cares  You know  No one really  It used to be just  What the Grammys  The Oscars  And the  What you call  Faggots  Would watch the Tonys  The Tonys  If I may use that word  Yeah  You know  Some of those  Award shows are  You know  On a Sunday  There's nothing else  Going on  You kind of get  A little excited  Like if it's like  Golden Globes  Or something  But then all of a sudden  You're like  The  The  The  The Tonys 
[01:59:30]  The Tonys  But then you like  Take a peek  Because you're thinking  It might be cool  And then you realize  Right away  That there's nothing  Cool about this at all  There's nothing I can relate to  In watching the Tonys  You know  They were saying  Chris Rock was saying  That only gay guys  Watch the Oscars  That's not true  If you're interested  In movies and stuff  You watch the Oscars  But as far as  The Tonys go  That is just  The gayest collection  Of gaydom  Ever to be gay  Is the Tonys  You can't  I cannot tune in 
[02:00:00]  For more than  Five minutes  I have no idea  What they're talking about  I have no idea  What shows  They're talking about  It's all about  You know  Broadway shows  I guess  And I have no clue  They're thanking people  You're like  What?

[02:01:30]  Leaving  And vanishing  Disappearing  He's had enough  Yeah but  Don't you have to be  In the public eye  And be  Like  Something people  Care about anymore  In order to then  Disappear  You can't  You can't be gone  And off the face  Of the world  For a few years  And then announce  You're leaving  The guy has been  Irrelevant for years  And he has no choice  Yeah  He has to leave  Because he has  Nothing else to offer 
[02:02:00]  This just in  Biz Markie  I'm done  I've done it all  Is that what he's saying now?  This just in  I read it off the AP  So it has to be real  Wow  Biz Markie also  Moving on  Finally  Damn  Boy he'll be missed  I don't know if you guys  Heard  I got bad news too  But Heather Mills  Has just announced  That she is walking away  From the world  Of moonwalking  Might have been funny  If I said leaving  The world of moonwalking  Instead of walking away  From moonwalking  Same word twice  Idiots  You've got very strict rules 
[02:02:30]  With your comedy  You have to  But it doesn't sound as well  Heather Mills is leaving  The world of moonwalking  Don't give it away at the end  But no  Heather Mills  And her one leg  Which is not good  For moonwalking  Is walking away  From moonwalking  Oh wow  Kaja Gugu  Says they're never  Recording another song  Kaja Gugu  We're finished  Kaja Gugu  Says we're done  With the pop music world  Alright Ryan  What's up  Hey not too much  How you fellas doing  You're calling  All the way from Oregon

[02:03:30]  The audience  And say you know  And of course  I want to thank  You know  I want to thank  Bruce  Down there  For just being  Being there for me  Being an inspiration  And giving me  Constant support  I love you  And you got all this  In five minutes huh  Five minutes  Is why I just  Tuned in  And it was on  Plus I had a notepad out  Making sure you got it on  Actually I wasn't even  Watching the whole thing  It was kind of  The picture in picture  As I was going through  The channel guides 
[02:04:00]  I have a feeling  You might have  T-voted this  T-voted the Tonys  Did I?  The phone rang  Tell him I'll call him back  Tonys are on  Tonys  He sets his T-vote  To everything Tony  So he gets  Odd couple reruns  And the Tony Awards  That's why he hates Danza  Because he thought  It was the  Tonys Danza show  Oh yeah  This guy Danza  Talking about the Tonys  Every day  All in five minutes  So that's pretty impressive  Best set decorator 
[02:04:30]  For a musical  Oh  Okay  Jim Morrison wants to  Check in Anthony  Really?  Yes  Jim Morrison from hell  Yes  Yeah I just called  To say I'm dead  And I won't be recording  Any more records  Alright  That's disappointing  That's just in  Jim's done  But the Doors aren't  Pompous assholes  Why?  The Doors?  Thinking they could  Go on without  Jim Morrison  Are they insane?  They just want to  Make money  That's how I see it 
[02:05:00]  Ray Manzurk  What?  He threw the Doors together  With what's his name  From the cult  Who's a great singer  But what are you doing?  I don't know  You know  Somehow maybe  You should call it  Something different  Because everyone knows  The Doors were  Jim Morrison  And a little bit of  Robbie Krieger's  Playing on the guitar  But Ray Manzurk  Talking about his organ  Playing was that important?  Not really  It was kind of  Cutting edge back then  And John Densmore  Who would be in a jazz band  If he wasn't discovered 
[02:05:30]  By the guys  You know  I'm so freaking bitter  Really?  About his role  In the band  It's like  Relax dude  You had nothing  Going on  Absolutely nothing  Dude  Have you seen footage  Of the Doors  And what John Densmore  Did for the band?  Yeah well  He had nothing  I don't really know  There could have been  A hundred guys  That did his role  In that band  I was never  A big Doors fan  So I really don't  Know much about him  Never a Doors fan  George Michael 
[02:06:00]  His meteoric rise  To stardom  First with Wham  Then when  As a solo artist  Was complicated  By the fact  That he was gay  While widely believed  To be straight  And he's quoted as saying  I thought  Oh my god  I'm a massive star  And I think  I may be a poof  This is not going  To end well  Michael eventually  Outed himself  After being charged  With lewd behavior  In a toilet  In 1998  And he lost 
[02:06:30]  His Brazilian boyfriend  Anselmo Felipe  To AIDS  An AIDS related condition  In 1993  I remember looking  At the sky  And saying  Don't do this  To me  Michael said  Referring to the moment  When Felipe  Told him  He was going  For medical tests  Yeah  A Brazilian guy  With AIDS  The odds of that  Are 50-50  God almighty 
[02:07:00]  I couldn't believe  When I shot drugs  With Tommy Morrison  That things didn't  Turn out well  How risky  Do you want to live  George  How do these guys  That are having  Sex like that  With some Brazilian  That has AIDS  Not getting AIDS  That shows you  The AIDS is not  Quite as easy  To get I suppose  As people want you  To believe  I think  Yeah  Probably a little  More difficult  To get  If you're  Banged  Because you know  He wasn't like  Oh please  Let's put on  A condom  No  You know  It was just  Poppers  And ass  Did you learn 
[02:07:30]  That from the  Tonys too  Yeah  Best ass  Sex  With poppers  All in five  Minutes  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And the winner  Is Aida  Aida  Big cock  Every day  Yeah  So he's leaving  George Michael  Bye bye  Take care George  I just thought  It would be  Very important  To explain myself  Before I disappear 
[02:08:00]  The 41 year old said  I truly believe  There's a life for me  That is not this one  Perhaps it will mean  Writing for other people  I have an ambition  To write a truly  Contemporary musical  Maybe you'll win a Tony  Not necessarily  Even for the stage  But for the screen  I've got to find a way  To make music  And enjoy it  The way I used to  All right  Fast Freddy writes  Stop the presses  Rich Voss  Leaves comedy world behind  Hey can I say 
[02:08:30]  That musicals  For the screen  Are horrendous  Always  West Side Story  Stunk  You didn't like  West Side Story  I had just  I had a bed  When you were  Yeah  No  It's awful  It's terrible  You didn't like  West Side Story  For the screen  No  With the stupid knives  I had a bed  Jerk offs  But it's a musical  It's not supposed to be  Hey there it is  Right  Horrendous  They're fighting  And dancing  At the same time 
[02:09:00]  That was a little weird  You watched the whole thing  No I've seen moments  I couldn't sit through it  I've watched the whole thing  Of West Side Story  I thought it was  Kind of nice  You know  You take it for what it is  It's a musical  You're not  You're not expecting  An action movie  Like that  It's dated  It's you know  An old movie  Was that the pre-show  For the Tonys  Yeah  As a matter of fact  They warmed us up  And you only watched  Five minutes of the Tonys  Because you were too tired  Because you just  Sat through the whole  West Side Story  I watched that  And then I watched  La Cage  When you reject 
[02:09:30]  You reject  God almighty  You didn't like that  It hurts me  Mario  Oh yeah  That dumb song  You know  It's classic  Romeo and Juliet  Put to modern  Modern times  Back then  Crap  I tried to watch  What's the one  With Don't Cry  From the Argentinians  I love the songs  Evita  Evita  Atrocious  Yeah  I hate when they sing  That guy  Just  Why  Yeah  And Madonna right 
[02:10:00]  Oh yeah  Well her  She can sing at least  But I mean  Why are you singing  No one talks like that  Now  But that's the thing  Of a musical  You sing all the lines  It's stupid  Where are you going  Shut up  I think  I need to find  A toilet  Yeah  It's never realistic dialogue  Why can't Opie  Sing in a musical  I haven't shit  In three days  My colon feels  Like cement  Like cement  Where  Where's the milk  I need some milk 
[02:10:30]  Today  Put on a pair  Of panties  After she  Tinkles  In them  It's always  I had a dream  That Washington  Fixed  The telephones  It's never realistic dialogue  Ever  I will give  Out  Strayley's  Email address  Don't cry  Because Ben 
[02:11:00]  Has such a big hog  He won't use it  To wreck  Your colon  I noticed  That there's a Ben  Hog joke  Every day  On the show  Of course  There is  Every day  It just makes me  Giggle  I saw  What was that one  Les Mis  I saw  Les Mis  And that's one of those  Where they sing  Every line  I never saw that  I like a little dialogue  I think  Miss Saigon  Was another one 
[02:11:30]  Just singing  Of the dialogue  Aida was talking  And singing  So that was kind of  You know  Wasn't all that bad  How many of these  Have you seen  I've seen many  That's why I had to  Watch the Tonys  He had to compare  His scorecard  With the actual winners  I've seen a few  Broadway shows  Dude I've seen  A couple of minutes  Of West Side Story  And the only one  I've ever seen  Was half of  Evita  Which was  Unwatchably awful 
[02:12:00]  Chicago I refused  To watch  I'm talking about  Actually seeing them  On Broadway  Not seeing the movie  That's even worse  You have to plan it  If you stumble onto it  By accident  And you're like  Maybe there's a scene  I could scrap to in here  That's almost understandable  But when you actually  Have to go  Alright hold on  Let me just fix my tie  And then leave the house  To go watch a bunch of people  Who will be dead in five years  Dancing anyway  It just stinks  You know  It was great  And probably the best  Best musical  Of all time  Jesus Christ Superstar  Never saw it  Never saw it 
[02:12:30]  No  The movie stunk  Because they tried to do  Some artsy fartsy  Stuff with it  But the  The Broadway show  Might I say  Fabulous  Are we talking about  Broadway shows  Well  Yeah  Screw Broadway  And bring on the broads  Maybe there's somebody  Here at XM  That we can invite in  And help  Six foot eight  With white hair  Maybe you can  Bumble in and  Spoil everything  Come in and  Spin some phone dial  So it sounds like  We're underwater again  Ah  All I hear is 
[02:13:00]  All I hear is  Ben's hog  In this  What is this  It's the opening  You know  Ovation  For what  Jesus Christ Superstar  Yeah  It's the orchestra  Getting ready  But  What's singing in this  Oh  What are we getting  Is this the opening  The whole  Go to a song  Where  Isn't Ian Gillen  On this album  Is he from  Deep Purple  Yeah  He also sang  With Sabbath  Dude  The guy's voice  Is ridiculous 
[02:13:30]  He's an amazing vocalist  Yeah  Find an Ian Gillen song  Eric's dad used to produce  Jesus Christ Superstar  For what  Local theater  No  Broadway  Really  For his church group  Back in the early 70's  Really  Yep  Eric's rich  Is he  Yeah  Is he a rich kid  But I'm not going to throw  Strawberries at Eric  Because he works hard  He does work very hard  He doesn't dress like  And he's trying to make  A name for himself  And I respect that  In anybody  And the name is called  Sweater with arms too short 
[02:14:00]  Who cares that he takes  A limo to  To work  Even though he's the  Little man on the totem pole  You found an Ian Gillen song  Which one is this  You've got to realize  It came out in the 60's  Oh  Heaven on their mind  This guy's voice  Was amazing back then  At last  Don't do well  I can see  Quite a range  Seems like a chick  But it's got to kick in  If you strip 
[02:14:30]  What the testosterone  This is the mellow part  Music is very dated  You know  It's got that groovy  Jesus  That rockin' voice  You're started to believe  The things that serve you  You really do believe  This talk of God is true  I can't eat M&M's 
[02:15:00]  Does he play pinball later on  In the musical?  Pinball wizard?  And then there's like  Anne Margaret is like  Rolling around in baked beans  Or something  Did you see Tommy on Broadway?  Why would you?  I saw that  The rock opera  It was very good on Broadway  What show haven't you seen Anthony?  How about we just go there?  Now to protect any heterosexuality 
[02:15:30]  I have left  I have not seen  Mamma Mia  The ABBA musical  These are the other musicals  You've got  Steve's raising his hand  Steve saw Mamma Mia  I'm laughing at you  And I've seen them all  You know why  Because Steve is so dumb  He thought it was a Vietnam thing  He thought Mamma was missing in action  Mamma Mia  This is great  Stallone comes in  And rescues her in a helicopter  These are the other musicals  Your dad produced  Or just in general?  Oh okay  I'm like holy crap 
[02:16:00]  Ian  What's his last name?  It was Gill, right?  Ian  It was great  When he sang with Sabbath  The one dumb album they did  Born Again  But he sang Trash  Which is a phenomenal song  Yeah  You know  I like that  Hey let's go to Anthony in Jersey  Hi Anthony  Anthony  What's going on guys?  Hey  Hey  Have you guys ever seen  Phantom of the Opera?  No  No I didn't see that one  I'll tell you what  I saw it  You saw Phantom of the Opera?  Yeah  I saw it  The New York stage  That was like the best one to go see  So if you guys 
[02:16:30]  You know since you're up there  Can go see it  I'd go see it  It's really good  It's not all like singing  And all that  I just don't like plays  I wanted to see one with Alan Alda  Alan Alda did something on Broadway  Of course I missed it  That I wanted to see  But I just hate musicals  I saw Cuckoo's Nest with  Gary Sinise  Gary Sinise  That I would have seen  That was really good  I would have liked that  But it was probably the book version  Did they show Chief talking through the whole thing?  Because he  In the book it's kind of narrated by Chief  Yeah it was  Okay  Yeah it's  Hey  Someone is challenging you 
[02:17:00]  On your Ian Gillen thing  Scott what's up?  What's going on boys?  Hey  That guy that's singing that song  His name is Murray Head  Murray Head?  Yes  But where's the Ian Gillen songs?  Ian Gillen played Jesus  Oh okay  That song is Judas  Now Murray Head  Is he the same guy that did  One Night in Bangkok?  Yeah  It is?  Same guy  I don't know  Thank you  I haven't heard any of this stuff  In quite a while  My knowledge amazes me too  Thank you  Somebody in this office  Is rubbing off on this entire show crew 
[02:17:30]  And it's making me nauseous  Thank you  Hey Opie  You seem to be a big fan  Of some avant-garde art films  You should look at Moulin Rouge  Oh that stunk  How would you know?  Because Big Kev said to watch it  So I started  I didn't even finish watching it  Just an awful mishmash of crap  Did Big Kev say that  As he was traipsing under orange gates  Saying it's all what it means to you?  That's what it means  You're an asshole  Yeah you know 
[02:18:00]  Kevin got really pissed off  About that whole  You know that  We didn't get the orange gate thing  We got it Kev  It stunk  There are letters  To the editor  Every day  In the New York papers  And not one  Saying how great it is  It's awful  Ronald writes  Hanging fabric is art  In that case  My mother is an artistic genius  At this very moment  She has orange and green towels  Flapping in the breeze  On a clothesline  Clothesline  Could you spare two New York City cops  To protect them?  Ooh  Yeah the cops are protecting  Every inch of this exhibit 
[02:18:30]  By the way  People are very bitter  About these things  Because they're awful  I had a few ideas  And I was told  Don't be stupid  Really?  They're all knowing  There's eyes all over the park  Big W-O-W on some of you  Undercover guys  All over the place  Arresting people left and right  Don't deface them  Left and right  They're being arrested  Yeah the gates  Is a joke of an exhibit  Those flags look like  Something from a construction zone  Or an entrance  To an outdoor flea market  Bloomberg was definitely  Sold a bad bill of goods 
[02:19:00]  The color is an offense  Offense to the natural beauty  Of Central Park  I can't wait for  The gates  To close  To close  Ah the gates  When are they there until?  I think it's Sunday  I don't know  Oh okay  Yeah it really is just  I'll go see them  It's just ridiculous  I want to get a picture  Under the gate waving  Hi  Hello  Just photoshop yourself in  Just take it off the news  Photoshop  You don't even have to go anywhere  You should just photoshop  A De Niro picture  Dude  Photograph

[02:29:30]  And it's you  And it's you  And it's you  And it's you  Sometimes you can't make it  On your own  You don't have to go  We fight  We fight  All the time  You and I 
[02:30:00]  That's alright  We're the same soul  I don't need  I don't need  I don't need to hear you say  That if we weren't so alike  You'd like me a whole lot more  Listen to me now 
[02:30:30]  I need to let you know  You don't have to go  And it's you  And it's you  And it's you  And I don't pick up the phone  Sometimes you can't make it 
[02:31:00]  On your own  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I don't know the way I'm taught  I'm sick of it all  But can you hear me?  Oh  You're the reason I say 
[02:31:30]  You're the reason  Why  You are  What is it  You're the reason I say  You're the reason I say  But you know, a house is for me, girl, don't leave me here alone.  And the truth is that I'm not sure how to look at me. 
[02:32:00]  Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  Sometimes you can't make it, the best you can do is to take it. 
[02:32:30]  Sometimes you can't make it on your own.  There's no regrets, but once you're back, we'd only cry again. 
[02:33:00]  Say goodbye.  Goodbye.  Ian Anthony, XM202.  He shoots.  ACC basketball.  It's the ACC Today.  Tie your shoes nice and tight because ACC basketball is breaking you down.  You better box your man out because we're grabbing the boards.  Round ball, baby.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:33:30]  Cut off the ricochet.  It's Thursday, the 17th of February, 2005.  I'm Ari Bikowski with your ACC Today.  Remember a few years back, Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton coached the Miami Hurricanes?  Yeah, those were the days the Canes were in the Big East.  Well, those days are past, but sometimes Coach Hamm looks back at his tenure as head coach  of what many call Sunshine U back in the old days.  But now he's going to have to go head-to-head against the Canes every season. 
[02:34:00]  And this year, well, the Canes have a youngster named Guillermo Diaz.  He's a guard and second in the league in scoring.  Coach Hamilton talks about Miami guard Guillermo Diaz.  Well, there's no question that Guillermo is right there with the best of them.  Number one, he has tremendous athleticism.  He has great shooting touch and he has a fearless personality.  And that's a very, very good combination when you assess a player. 
[02:34:30]  They run an offense where they go to him.  He has the freedom to drive, penetrate, as well as shoot the ball.  And so it makes him a very, very difficult offensive player for any of the ACC guards to defend.  And next, Coach Hamilton talks about having a balanced offensive attack.  I think what's happening is you try to go out and recruit players.  You want to have all, all of us would love to have all go-to guys.  Unfortunately, you're not able to recruit for so many. 
[02:35:00]  But I would prefer to just have a complete team.  Guys that have an inside game, guys that have a perimeter game.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  Yo, check one, two.  This is Flavo Flav, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony right here, boys.  Wow. 
[02:35:30]  Some guys are not happy with the musical selection, Opie.  Which one, Mary Head or U2?  U2.  Great U2 song goes perfect with a javalog and a room full of firemen.  Amen, sir.  That's some fast Freddy.  Good point, Freddy.  Hey, guys, if you need some filler to go take a shit or something, could you please make sure it doesn't suck?  Yeah, but then there's people out there that like it.  You know, you can't... 
[02:36:00]  Oh, I know.  We can't please everyone.  You can't be serious.  Can we hear the turn it off clip again?  You know how many truckers want to hear country music going into breaks?  Some Johnny Cash or something?  I wouldn't mind that.  Well, Johnny Cash, you know, but maybe Charlie Pryde or something.  I love Charlie Pryde.  You do?  I was trying to come up with one you'd hate.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Is he the one that sang...  Yeah, he's the one that sang...  Couldn't tell you.  What, behind closed doors?  Did you happen to see?  When we get behind closed doors...  Is that Charlie Pryde or another Charlie? 
[02:36:30]  No, Charlie Rich.  Charlie Rich did that?  I think so.  There's a lot of truckers laughing at you guys right now.  She makes me glad that I am a man.  I'm a man.  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.  I'll beat my wife is what goes on.  Are you about a size 14?  You know what station is...  Buddy Rich?  I'll get you down in the well.  You know what station's not bad on XM?  What?  And when I'm driving my mom around, we listen to that Channel 10 America. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, America.  It's kind of like old school country.  Really?  You get some tunes on there that you remember.  A little Ritalin?  It's not bad.  Dude, I love the Decades Channel.  Except the 40s.  I can't relate to anything.  I hate the Decades Channels on XM.  Dude, I love them.  I hate them.  50s, 60s, 70s.  I love a lot of the music channels, but I hate them.  They go a little too deep.  Well, that and there's just too much.  They're just all over the place because it is the whole decade.  So they'll play like...  Let's say the 80s Channel will play, I don't know, let's say some cool YouTube from the  80s, but then it's like Whitney Houston. 
[02:37:30]  It's like...  Wow.  I like that.  I like that eclectic taste.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Ben's in the studio.  I love the 80s Channel.  I just want to hear the songs I know.  I know, but I like it.  I heard like Bat Dance by Prince, which I haven't heard in years from the Batman movie.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I heard that.  How awful is that?  No, because when was the last time you heard that song?  I like Fred, which does like 80s New Wave, but when you do the...  Yeah, I like Lucy.  When you do the decade, like the 70s is the best decade in music history, in my opinion.  Oh, it's not.  That's for rock and roll. 
[02:38:00]  Without a doubt.  60s.  No way.  70s beat the 60s.  64 to 69 is better than the 70s.  Think of all the bands that came out in the 70s and had their heyday.  Yeah, Leonard Skinner.  So?  What's wrong with Leonard Skinner?  Am I losing as a fine song?  Very hard to find it.  The 60s is weird though.  You turn on the 60s and you get like...  Cherish is the word I use to describe.  You know, who wants to hear that crap?  Happy together!  I like that one.  I'm with you.  I like Jim.  I like being all over the place. 
[02:38:30]  I love it.  But, you know, I want to hear stuff I know.  There's a lot of songs they play.  You can go 10 songs in a row.  It's like, what?  Yeah, that's true.  I've never heard this before.  You want to hear something that's a little more hip.  I want a few more of the hits.  I understand they want to be a little more hip, maybe, and not play all the typical stuff,  be a little eclectic.  I understand that.  You know?  When I first got XM, which was over two years ago, man, the music channels were just horrendous.  Yeah.  They wanted to be too hip for the room and all that.  Because, you know, they were going for that audience that really had a deep appreciation 
[02:39:00]  for music.  Yeah.  I think they got in a good place.  You know, now we're, you know, current day, the selections are much, much better.  Mm-hmm.  You get a little variety, a little obscurity, but you also get to hear some of the hits  and some of the songs that are cool enough for regular radio, but regular radio, you  know, ignored.  A lot of the top tracks plays a lot of stuff that's recognizable, like classic rock and  stuff.  Yeah, top tracks is good.  We put that on The Office after the show sometimes.  That's great.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  And deep tracks.  Deep tracks. 
[02:39:30]  Cool.  But the 90s is weird to listen to, because they really mix it up.  That's dancing.  A lot of dancing.  Yeah.  You know, I expect to hear maybe some Pearl Jam sound.  Nah, you got to go to Lucy.  You got to go to Lucy, bro.  Yeah, I got to go to Lucy for that.  Ben and I know.  You tell us what song you want to hear, we'll tell you what you have.  No, I listen to the Lucy at home.  Lucy's great.  Lucy's great.  Lucy gets a little in the production.  I actually like the Boneyard better than any of them.  They play the best.  For me, they play like good heavy metal.  I like the Boneyard.  Yeah.  I mean, I like the music.  Your buddy's on that.  Yeah, I don't care.  The music is good.  I mean, you know, whatever. 
[02:40:00]  I don't care if Hitler has a show on there.  Eddie Trunk's on the Boneyard.  If Hitler played the thrill of it all, I'd love him too.  Eddie Trunk's on the Boneyard on the weekends, right?  Oh, is that what he's on?  I don't even know.  Is it Saturday?  Yeah, he does a good job.  Is he broadcast out of here?  He does a great job.  He's over in the other studio there.  Oh, we don't allow Eddie Trunk to use our studio?  No.  No, he goes over in the other studio.  Oh, wow.  That must really upset him.  He could use ours.  Of course he could use ours.  He should be able to use our studio.  And my new buddy Piazza.  Piazza?  Yeah, Mike Piazza isn't in here turning dials and stuff.  Screwing up our phones.  Let's go to Jeremy Spoken. 
[02:40:30]  Jeremy.  Hey, how's it going?  Going good.  You guys are going or keeping me with XM.  I'm a big talk radio fan.  Okay.  I'm on the road about 600 miles a day.  Okay.  And XM keeps doing this little crappy thing with G. Gordon Liddy and all that stupid  Hippocratic bitch Dr. Laura cutting into the talk radio.  Yeah, we're not Dr. Laura fans.  What do you mean we?  You're not a Dr. Laura fan? 
[02:41:00]  I don't know enough about her to have an opinion.  She ends every show with go on and take on the day.  Oh, alright.  How can you like it?  Well, don't talk for me.  I said we as in men.  Oh.  Alright, everyone except Ope.  None of us like Dr. Laura.  I really don't know much about her.  Oh, she finds you repulsive.  Believe me.  She hates this program.  I guarantee you.  That's fine.  Alright, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  I love the show.  Alright, cool.  Let's go to Tennessee.  We also don't like Nirvana or Pearl Jam.  Easy. 
[02:41:30]  Just got Pearl Jam's greatest hits.  What was it?  What was it?  45?  They have...  It's a double CD.  They have so many damn hits.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you for showing me the pictures of Dr. Laura naked.  Let me see that.  Ew.  Awful.  Let's go to Jerry in Tennessee.  Oh, look at that big bush.  Nice.  Nice.  Big bush and I cannot lie.  Nice.  Scroll down a little bit.  Let me see the beaver.  Yeah.  There you go.  Let me see the beaver.  Little Dr. Laura there, huh?  I mean, she wasn't that bad looking when she was younger, but the problem, the big bush takes 
[02:42:00]  away from it though, man.  No matter how hot you are.  There you go.  Big lips.  Keep on that.  All right.  What's up, Jerry?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm doing wonderful.  I got to tell you guys, you play country music going into break.  I'm going to throw my fucking XM radio out the window and back up over to about 90 miles  a minute.  Point taken.  All right.  Play some tool.  All right.  Oh, tool.  Nothing wrong with tool.  All right. 
[02:42:30]  Let's move on and continue with the show.  Bob Kelly checking in.  Bobby?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hi, Bob.  Bob.  Bob, when are we going to do the...  It's become a joke on this show.  People are actually getting really mad.  When are we going to do the midget audio?  We should just keep telling them we're going to do it and never do it.  I don't even think it's in the studio anymore.  I think she's actually rotated out.  She's real full-size now.  She's not a midget anymore.  She's actually full-size now.  She's grown.  She's a real person and a real human.  You know, I think there's going to be a huge letdown when we finally play the HBO 
[02:43:00]  midget audio.  Of course there will be.  Yeah, it's going to be awful.  All right.  Well, you'll have to come in soon and we'll do it anyway.  All right.  I will.  I'll definitely do it.  How are you guys doing?  Are you coming in a little after 10 just to film these guys for a second?  Yeah, I wanted to do that if that's okay, you guys.  I got Anthony last week, that video I did for the troops.  Yes.  Yeah, I appreciate that, Anthony.  Thank you very much.  Certainly.  At least I could do it. 
[02:43:30]  I'd like to redo it just a little bit, not to bust your balls, but, you know.  I don't care.  You didn't look that enthused.  I didn't?  No, you were playing a video.  I was playing poker.  I thought it would be a good gag, you know, where I'd just kind of glance over and tell  them, thank you for giving your lives.  But I have money to win.  Hang on.  I have two aces.  Yeah.  And I got a good hand here.  And I've got an ace on the turn.  No, of course.  Come in and we'll do it.  I appreciate it, though.  Thank you.  And I already have Opie, but I'd love to get both of you guys at the same time. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, but this video, I mean, what is it?  I know it's for a good cause, but what is it?  It's one night at the cellar.  I taped the whole show, the last show.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  I got Colin.  I got Jim.  I got all the guys on the show.  And I did interviews with, you know, everybody behind the scenes, all kinds of stuff.  But it's all pro-troop stuff, you know.  You know, God bless you guys.  Hope you come home soon.  Hey, in between the comics, do you get footage of each comic kicking your little dog? 
[02:44:30]  Ah, you mother...  Fucking...  Why?  No.  Nobody kicks my little dogs.  I love his dogs.  But don't you think...  I have nightmares about you kicking my dog.  Don't you think that would be a great segue in between the comics?  Like, Colin comes off stage and just gives your dog a little kick?  Yeah.  Not to hurt it, just to annoy it.  I'm not into hurting your dog.  I just want to...  Just to annoy it a little bit.  Let's have a little squeak.  Just a little bit.  It's a little dog.  You can't control it.  If you kick it in the belly, you're going to break a rib.  Or a liver. 
[02:45:00]  Ugh.  Alright, so then you need Anthony and I to do a little, hey, how's it going?  Yeah, I would just like you guys to say something to the troops.  Hey guys, how you doing?  It's Opie and Anthony.  You know, God bless you.  We love what you're doing.  We hope you come home safe.  You know, stuff like that.  And that's it.  Just a little promo for the troops.  Do I have to bring the Lord into it?  Holy shit, that's Opie and Anthony.  I have to say, God bless you.  Make the DVD a little legit.  You know?  I'll bring no religion into this, Opie. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, shit.  But I got, uh...  I got, uh...  Ooh, I got Seymour Butts on it.  Telling everybody that he, you know, he can have anal sex with Mariposa.  And he's going to eat every enlisted woman's pussy.  Didn't they get Jenna Jameson for it, too?  Yeah, Jenna Jameson, I didn't put her on the DVD, though, because she...  When he asked you, he was like, can you say something to the troops?  She was like, uh, yeah, uh, hi.  Like, she was annoyed.  Nah.  I really, I didn't want to put that on there. 
[02:46:00]  It would have been disappointing.  Okay, good.  Don't.  But I do...  How is this going to be distributed to the troops?  What'd you say?  How is it going to be distributed to the troops?  I actually, I ran into a little snag yesterday.  We actually got it all done, and I went down to the company.  Wait, if you got it all done, why do you need Anthony and I to do our part again?  Because I have...  I didn't have a...  It's one more edit on Monday.  And I want to slip you guys in on the end.  Because I have Opie by himself, I have an Anthony by himself. 
[02:46:30]  Well, that's how we live our lives outside the studio, so keep it like that.  Yeah, but apparently...  Well, I would want to put you guys both together because apparently you use your super human  funny power when you guys are separated.  You need to be together.  There you go.  And I would like you guys to be together.  If you don't want to do it, that's fine.  I'll keep what we have.  That's okay, Opie.  Yeah, you might as well.  No, Opie stated because it was before the show came back on.  Right.  I'll definitely keep...  If you don't want to do it, Opie, I'll keep it like that.  No, if you don't want to do something for... 
[02:47:00]  If you don't want to take five minutes...  If you don't want to do something for the troops, five minutes...  No, Opie, seriously, I'm not even busting your balls.  If you don't want to do something for the troops and take five seconds out of your day,  that's cool.  Do I get to kick your dog?  Hmm.  Just a little...  I'll let you kick Jim in the gut once.  Look like this, look.  Just like this.  Doink.  Did you say look?  Look.  Well, these guys are looking.  These guys are looking.  Just a little...  Doink.  You can't kick my dog.  I mean, your dog won't even yelp. 
[02:47:30]  It'll just be like...  But you can't kick my dog.  How about just a little kick for Kelby?  Can he kick Kelby a little bit?  How about I just...  How about I just flick his belly with my finger, just like...  All right, I will let you flick his belly.  Just like this.  Ow.  I'll let you flick his belly with your finger, but you have to close your eyes when you do  it.  If you flick his mule while you do it, then there you go.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right, so...  No, of course we'll film something for you, Bob.  Come in, Jen.  Oh, you did.  So what happened?  You went down to the DVD place.  What's it called?  This place...  Well, the place I got my CDs, it's Music on the Run, which is actually run by this lady,  Adriana Rawati from...  What? 
[02:48:30]  They have a website, www.truetone.com.  What's the website?  www.truetone.com.  No dot after the WWW, huh?  And...  Yeah, there's a dot.  Music on the Run.  Where is it located?  It's right on 43rd between 10th...  43rd and 44th on 10th Ave.  Ah.  And...  Midtown.  I actually sent them a lot of business.  I went there.  I've been going there and whatever.  And they've been great.  But yesterday, when I dropped off this mock-up DVD called Full Metal Comedy, just to show 
[02:49:00]  them what it was about, I actually...  My agent got a call back and she said...  This is what she said to me.  I will not do anything with this.  I don't support the troops.  I don't support the war.  Wow.  And my agent was like, wait a minute, I understand you're not supporting the war, but this isn't  about the war.  This is about the troops.  This is for the troops over there.  She was like, I don't support the troops. 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  And he was like, did you just say you don't support the troops?  Our troops, you have...  She was, I don't support them.  I don't want to do anything for them.  What's her name again?  Her name, I believe it's Adriana Rewati.  She's the owner of the company.  She's owned this company in America.  In America for 30, the past 30 years.  Adriana Rewati?  Rewati.  R-O-W-A-T-T-I.  R-O-I.  What kind of name is that? 
[02:50:00]  From where?  The actual company is based out of Hackensack, New Jersey, called True Tones Inc.  Doesn't that name sound?  At www.truetone.com.  So he went down there to make sure.  And when he walked in, she says, I do not...  This is all she kept saying.  She would say nothing else.  I do not support the war, and I do not support our troops.  And he was like, you've got to be kidding me.  Well, did you guys want it for free, or are you willing to pay? 
[02:50:30]  Well, the thing is, is I called back up, and I...  She wouldn't even get on the phone with me.  And the kid that was there who, you know...  Can't blame her for that.  Yeah.  Who the hell would?  I know.  Look what happens.  Look what happens.  But, uh...  You're stuck in a phone call.  It goes nowhere.  And I go...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I called up, and I go, look, if this is about money, I can raise as much money as I need  to, to pay for this full price.  I don't want a deal, nothing. 
[02:51:00]  I'll pay for it, just as a business transaction.  Is that what this is about, money?  And he goes, no.  She doesn't want anything to do with this.  She will not do it.  She doesn't support the war.  Right, we got that part.  She doesn't support our troops.  That's all they kept saying to me.  So this is music on the run.  Yeah.  I wish I had a phone number for them, but we couldn't give it out anyway.  But let's just say it's on 10th Avenue, between 43rd and 44th.  Maybe you agree with her stance, and you want to take your business there. 
[02:51:30]  So it's music on the run, refuses to do anything for the troops.  And on truetone.com, Adrienne Rawati.  And maybe you agree with her, and you want to give business to that company.  Oh, there you go.  Feel free.  You don't support our troops at all.  Music on the run on 10th Avenue is where you can take your business.  Yeah, apparently our troops are, you know, they're over just murdering and killing people  or whatever.  I don't know what her point of view is, how she can take that stance.  But, you know, I'm going to Iraq in two weeks.  I'm going to Afghanistan and Iraq with Colin. 
[02:52:00]  And I wanted to bring these, you know, DVDs with us to give to them.  Is Colin going for nail care tips?  I'm actually going, and Steve Burns, comic Steve Burns.  I hope they don't look at you and think you're one of the insurgents.  Well, I'm actually, I'm going to grow a beard so in case they do pull us over.  But, you know, I have nothing to worry about.  The only one that has something to worry about is Steve, a little Asian comic Steve.  And Colin has nothing to worry about because if they were going to cut his head off, 
[02:52:30]  they'd probably give up halfway through and want to cut off one of his skinny legs.  Muhammad, bring chainsaw.  All right, we'll come in at 10 o'clock, Bob.  All right, I will, man.  I just, I appreciate you guys doing this, man.  Opie, really, honest to God, and Anthony, thank you so much.  Because seeing you guys on this will actually be like, wow, that's great.  Bob, you realize this call could have taken 30 seconds, right?  Yeah, but I just woke up and I really don't get on the air that much  and I just wanted to, you know, maybe talk a little longer.  A little longer. 
[02:53:00]  So when are you available to come in so we can do the HBO thing?  There you go.  Hey, Anthony.  He's still answering that question.  I know he is.  We got audio of them talking about Colin.  You want to explain really fast?  Oh, yeah.  It's quick.  Colin is on the Celebrity Poker that's on Bravo.  And he actually won.  He played some of the worst poker I've ever seen in my life.  And even the announcers were goofing on him.  Because he was playing, like you get dealt a hand of a couple of cards and they were awful. 
[02:53:30]  Anyone in their right mind would have folded.  Colin's playing everything.  Betting, calling bets on just the worst hands ever.  And he wound up winning, but everyone was making fun of him.  Yeah, here's the commentators.  Phil Gordon talking about Colin Quinn.  One commentator, actually.  Colin shows a jack of diamonds.  And Tripp Jax is going to take Colin Quinn.  A nice spot here.  Folks, playing jack five offsuit, not a good idea.  Colin's getting very lucky here.  Yeah, he had a jack five offsuit. 
[02:54:00]  Not even suited.  And he plays it and the flop comes out.  Two more jacks.  Three jacks.  Three jacks.  The guy was the luckiest I've ever seen anybody playing cards.  More from Phil Gordon.  And Colin with an 8-10.  So it's 18 to me.  Looks like he's calling this out of position.  This is just horrible.  Colin calls.  No, no, no, Phil.  He has an 8-10 offsuit.  Yeah, okay.  You must have missed that.  You must have missed that.  You must have missed that.  You got an 8-10 offsuit. 
[02:54:30]  You don't even consider those hands.  You throw them away.  No, I'll see it.  Horrible hands.  One more from Phil Gordon.  Colin is what is known in the professional poker world as a calling station.  If you can find a guy like this to play poker with you at a high level, you will murder him long term.  They may catch a couple lucky flops early, but you can't win playing as passively as he does.  But he won.  He just kept winning.  He kept winning, and he was the last one at the table, and he won. 
[02:55:00]  So he goes on to their tournament of champions, I guess.  He's going to be playing in that collection of all of them who have won.  And I know how that turns out.  You do?  Yep.  Oh, you talk to him?  I spoke to Kyle.  Oh, you did?  Yep.  You're not going to tell us, obviously.  I'm not allowed to do that.  Not allowed.  I'm allowed to divulge.  Well, let's not forget, next week, Anthony's going to be at the World Poker Tour in L.A.  We're all going.  That's right.  We're going to do the show from L.A. next Wednesday and Thursday, I believe.  I'm in the Invitational.  And Anthony's going to be playing some poker, and we're going to be broadcasting the whole 
[02:55:30]  thing.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yes, sir.  I know I do.  Oh, my God.  We've got Adam from Maroon 5 on the line.  I've got to say hi to Adam.  Adam, what's going on, buddy?  What's up?  Sorry to make you wait so long.  It's all good.  A big Grammy winner, and we're keeping you on hold for some hack comic.  Hey.  How stupid are we?  It's like hack comic or guy who just won Grammy.  Both totally interesting for different reasons.  There you go.  His phone call. 
[02:56:00]  Interesting.  You're just being nice.  It was a bore fest.  So what's going on, Adam?  No, I'm just waking up somewhere in Florida.  Oh, at least you're in our time zone.  Sometimes we talk to people from L.A., and it's, you know, 3 in the morning.  Yeah, they're calling us with, like, morning wood from their beds.  But rock guy, you know, he's probably used to sleeping late.  You don't get up this early.  No, this is unheard of.  Yeah.  Sorry.  What's up?  First Grammy, right? 
[02:56:30]  First Grammy.  Yeah, we're one for one, man.  What the hell is that like?  Trippy.  You ever think?  No.  Well, yeah, I think in the beginning you'd dream about that.  Oh, by the way, I can curse.  That's so cool, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking A, dude.  That helps you out.  Yeah, you know, that's just kind of what you originally started out thinking about,  and then all of a sudden it happens, and it feels like you're dreaming.  It's unbelievable, man.  And, you know, Kanye was supposed to win, and we did, and it was a shock, dude. 
[02:57:00]  I was totally taken aback by everything.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend is the biggest fan of you guys.  And we were talking, and he said, these guys are going to be the next best thing.  They're the biggest band since, like, you know, phew.  That's crazy.  Since you know what, I didn't hear you say.  No, he just said he's just a freak for you guys, man.  He absolutely loves you.  You heard right.  You heard right.  No, no.  You definitely heard right. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  So were you freaking out when you had to, well, had to, when you were accepting the award,  or what?  Well, yeah, man.  Like, and also they do, they pump your head full of the shit.  You're supposed to remember everyone's name, and there's eight million people they want you  to thank, and everyone wants their kudos and all this shit.  So you get up there, and your mind is fucked because you can't piss anybody off.  And so, and they all deserve the respect, too.  So it's like, you know, I forgot to thank my family.  It was horrible.  Yeah, so there's no fun in it.  You're just making sure you don't piss anyone off up there, right? 
[02:58:00]  No, and the people that I forgot, I forgot tons of people.  They were all understanding.  I was pretty, I was pretty rocked up there.  So you actually have a speech prepared before you actually go, and you know you're nominated  for something like that.  Do you actually have a speech prepared?  No, I didn't have a speech prepared.  I think it was a combination of not wanting to sound like too much of an asshole because,  you know, having something prepared kind of sometimes, unless you're Bono and you can  pull it off, sounds a little bit, if it's really, if it sounds really contrived and  rehearsed.  Yeah.  A little bit arrogant, you know?  Yeah, and you didn't want to get up there and maybe make a mistake and blow out a curse. 
[02:58:30]  Sometimes it's a little more charming to be caught off guard.  And I was perfectly willing to do that if we had won, so.  So what happens right after you leave the stage?  You freak out, you know?  It's funny, we went off stage and, you know, the first thing they do is they take the Grammy  away from you, because it's not really your Grammy, it's just the show Grammy.  It's the prop.  And they're like, shit, I want to keep that.  And they take that away from you and they, you know, they shuffle you back and, you know, 
[02:59:00]  they, you know, throw you around a million different places and all of a sudden the pressure  is up in your face.  And you're like, oh my God.  And we all went to the bathroom afterwards.  And we were just like, freaking out, you know, pounding the walls and jumping up and  down.  Couldn't believe it.  In the bathroom?  Yeah, it was like the one place of solace.  Do they actually mail you your Grammys?  Is that how you get them?  Yeah, I think so.  Okay.  I'm expecting it soon, hopefully.  Oh, you haven't gotten it?  UPS or FedEx?  No.  Nice.  Are you going to get even better pussy because now you're a Grammy winner? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah, now I can get laid every day.  How is that out on the road?  You got a girl or something?  I'm currently single.  Oh, really?  Nice.  I don't think I really have, I think I have the responsibility to every person in the world  out there, every male in the world to be single right now.  Really?  It's my obligation.  Are you just, jeez, just tearing it up, I bet.  Are you just banging in every city?  Well, also, too, it's like, no.  I mean, you can't, I don't know, man. 
[03:00:00]  Sleeping around, having sex all the time gets a little bit shady, especially in this day  and age, and it's not what it used to be.  I wish it was the 70s and nobody knew all the crappy diseases they were getting.  You know, I still have plenty of fun, you know, and whatever.  You get a lot of girls at your shows, though, right?  Oh, there's tons of girls.  A lot of them are too young, though.  Yeah.  Really?  Well, that's what you have to say.  Yeah, that's what you have to say in a national radio show.  Wow.  There's the official line.  Too young for me. 
[03:00:30]  Hey, Adam, we're with you.  You know, wink, wink.  Wink, wink.  It's a national radio show.  We understand.  You'd be surprised.  Too young.  The ones in the strollers are too young.  That's about it.  It all depends on what country you're working in.  I mean, in the U.S., it's 18.  In Thailand, hey, enjoy.  But the moms that bring the young daughters to the shows now, they're sluts.  They are total whores.  They're looking for some action.  Oh, you know.  So your tour dates are starting.  The Honda Civic tour you guys are doing, and a buddy of mine is definitely going. 
[03:01:00]  And he said that, man, tickets are probably going to be pretty scarce.  I hope so, man.  I hope tickets are scarce.  That's what you want.  Where do you guys start touring?  We're kicking it off in L.A., which is amazing.  It's going to be very, very nice.  Hometown.  Who are you touring with?  We're touring with great bands, too.  A band called The Thrills from Ireland.  Oh, yeah.  Really, really cool.  And a band called The Donnas, which are great.  The female band. 
[03:01:30]  A bunch of hot girls.  Yeah, the drummer's really hot.  Yeah, they're really cool people, too.  My buddy Jay wants to bang the drummer really bad.  Oh.  Well, you know.  I don't know, man.  She seems like a tough chick.  I don't know if she's going to give it up.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Mike in New York.  A big fan.  Mike, hold on.  I've got to do this first.  Yeah, I just wanted to praise him.  I heard the song She Well Be Loved on the In Demand channel.  I was just thinking, how cool is that, you know?  That song's huge.  To be able to hear your own song on that.  That just shows you how well this band is doing. 
[03:02:00]  You guys are awesome.  Thanks a lot, man.  And can I shamelessly plug my own band?  Go for it.  It's berniecold.com.  We're playing The Chance Theater in Poughkeepsie on March 19th with a band called Theater of Pain.  Ah, The Chance.  We played The Chance Theater, man.  Who hasn't played The Chance?  Yeah, it's a great place, man.  Anthony.  Awesome.  I played there.  Anthony even played The Chance.  I remember that place.  Nice.  Hell yeah.  Wow, it ain't The Chance anymore for you guys.  Jesus Christ.  How many of you guys have been together?  We've been together for 11 years.  See? 
[03:02:30]  It's one of those overnight successes.  Exactly.  And you still get along well, or is there one guy that you're just like, oh, this son  of a bitch every time?  No, man.  We're a pretty harmonious bunch.  Yeah?  Yeah, we get along pretty well.  Don't get into the studio and yell at each other for things?  Well, we yell at each other, but who doesn't?  Now, you guys changed the name of the band.  My buddy's been a fan since, I think, Cowerous Flowers you guys are called, right?  Yeah.  And when you guys changed the name of the band, he's like, I mean, I don't know how  it's going to work out. 
[03:03:00]  And I'm like, well, you just got to see.  Yeah, I mean, names are stupid.  Our name is horrible.  We hate our names.  Yeah, where did you get that one?  Can't tell you.  Really?  Secret.  Maroon Falls.  It's a secret?  Come on.  Yeah.  Listen, we had to...  Does it have something to do with ass sex?  What did you say?  I said, does it have something to do with ass sex?  All right.  Why would it ever be a secret?  Anything to do with ass sex.  No.  All right.  Go ahead. 
[03:03:30]  I can tell you.  Why is it a secret, though?  I don't know, man.  Why not?  Well, that's a good answer.  It's just one of those that adds to the mystique.  Now, have you guys got...  I know why, though, because they thought it was really cool how they got the name and  then realized, ugh.  Yeah.  I wish we didn't smoke all that marijuana when we decided on this.  Hey, dude, are you guys going to go back and grab any...  I know The Fourth World was an album.  Are you guys going to go back and grab that and then re-release it under this name? 
[03:04:00]  Well, you know, we were with a different record label back then.  Warner Brothers has already done that.  Not with this name.  You know, it's illegal, but they did it with the other name.  And thank God we changed names for that reason.  Because that is not an artistic statement I stand behind.  Well, it's almost like when Stephen King was writing the Richard Bachman books.  You know what I mean?  People really didn't buy them, but then when he said that, yeah, this was just kind of me  ghostwriting under this name, people went crazy and bought them.  My friend told me they bought, like, you know, thousands.  Yeah, well, the name becomes pretty important to sell the product, I guess. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  Like, Chris Gaines didn't sell too many records.  No.  But Garth Brooks did.  That's the same guy?  Remember Chris Gaines?  Oh, yeah.  That was the same guy?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  I never knew that.  With a wig or something, right?  I'm a big Chris Gaines fan.  Yeah, but that was, like, some bullshit.  That was, like, he, like, he was already so huge and he decided to just release, like,  a dark pop record with this, like, he put a wig on and, like, tried to do it and it 
[03:05:00]  just didn't fly.  Yeah, well, what an ass.  And no one was buying it, by the way.  No.  All right, Adam, thank you so much.  Congratulations on the Grammy for Best New Artist, man.  Awesome, man.  Thank you so much, you guys.  Great new success to you and the guys in Maroon 5.  Thank you.  Are you, um...  What was that?  There's Adam from Maroon 5.  You nailed him so bad.  Are you, uh...  This is their latest song.  We'll go to break with a little taste of Maroon 5.  She will be loved, right? 
[03:05:30]  Uh-oh.  You wanna play?  Why not?  You wanna play?  Why not?  Go ahead, play it.  We got another guest here.  The chicks might like it.

[03:09:30]  telling you to take out the trash, then come back in the house and give her a fucking foot  rub. And Matt C. from Philly. Maroon 5 is this band. They play this song where I work 
[03:10:00]  every night at least three times. I hate this fucking song and whatever shit dick parts hook  in writing it. Wow. But the truckers love that one. Stop with the faggot music. What's next?  Ricky Martin. Great choice, bastards. This song eats man ass. Maroon 5 music to be pussy whipped  too. Turn this fucking song off. The longer this song plays, the more limp my wrist becomes. 
[03:10:30]  Basically very mixed reviews. It was just a taste. You got the dude on from Maroon 5. They  just win Best Noir at the Grammys. You got to give a little taste of why they won. That's  all. A little taste, huh? A little taste. I was in the bathroom. Norton was taking his leak.  I was in a stall and I was jumping up and down in jubilation. Why? I crapped.

First that gay Murray head song and now Maroon 5? Shit.  Yeah, but that Murray head song is like a guilty pleasure for someone out there. 
[03:12:00]  One night in Bangkok with that weird rap thing in the middle of the song.  All right, why don't we, uh, little taste. That song left a bad taste in my mouth. Wow.  Yeah, it was walking in Memphis. Hold on, this thing.  It's only hit.  Yeah, this is, this is Mark.  Yeah, it's a little taste. The same little taste of what altar boys get.  Here, it started over there. Sorry.  This is Mark Cohen. Go ahead.  Remember this thing?  We'll walk in a river. 
[03:12:30]  You remember, right?  Of course.  Put on my blue suede shoes and I'm going to the plane.  Go ahead and the plane.  Touchdown in the land of the Delta Blues.  In the middle of the pouring rain.  It's tight. It's tight.  W-C handy.  It's tight.  Won't you look down over me.  Yeah, I've got a first class ticket.  But I'm as blue as a boy can be. 
[03:13:00]  Then I'm walking in Memphis.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  All right, sorry, sorry.  I didn't want to piss you off, man.  That's actually the song Matthew Shepard was humming as they cracked his head with a cowboy boot.  Are you insane?  What?  I'm out of that one.  A boot right through his head.  Why are you out of that one?  I'm out.  Why?  That's harsh.  Oh, I hope he's going to keep his job.  That's right.  You get fired.  That's right.  Like Miss Jones.  That's right.  I don't approve of that one. 
[03:13:30]  Some people thought it was funny.  Not me, even though I'm the fat whore that played it on my show.  All right.  What is a liger, by the way?  Did you see this picture in the paper?  Regis just showed it on...  A liger.  On Regis and the blonde.  It's huge.  Kelly Ripa.  Kelly what?  Ripa.  Oh, yeah.  Kelly Ripa.  It's a lion and tiger mix.  Yeah, 900 pounds.  It's 900 pounds and it's still growing.  Did you see the picture in the paper today?  They're huge. 
[03:14:00]  What is it, though?  It's just a mixture of a lion and a tiger.  They happen to get giant.  Is this something that you've been doing for a while?  Rip out gay men's throats in Las Vegas.  That wasn't a liger, was it?  Look how tall this thing is.  Yeah, that thing is huge.  I actually saw one of those at a Renaissance Festival, Opie.  Oh, God.  I bet you were only at the Renaissance Festival for five minutes, right?  Five minutes.  It's just in time to take in all the faggity activities. 
[03:14:30]  Ligers.  Cha.  Duh.  Duh.  Was it a big liger?  Yeah.  It was huge.  And we all sat down on wooden benches and watched the guy do a little show with it in  the middle of nowhere, waiting for it to rip his head off where no help could come  for hours, I'm sure.  Did the liger work for its meal?  It certainly did.  Standing up.  Mm-hmm.  It was great.  Good fun.  Wasn't it just laying around?  No.  Like ligers like to do? 
[03:15:00]  No.  Liger?  Well, I hear these ligers are...  God damn liger.  ...are awfully big, so they're a bit lazy.  Yeah.  You can keep this line of comments going.  I'd rather just hang out.  All right.  Let's get the boys in here.  Yes.  We got the gang from the Chappelle show.  We got Charlie Murphy.  Bring him in.  Charlie Murphy.  Billy Burr and then... 
[03:15:30]  Darnell Rollins.  Darnell, right?  Darnell.  No, D-O-N-N.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  How you doing, man?  There's Charlie Murphy.  There's Billy.  Morning, morning, morning.  I want to sit by Jim, man.  You want to sit there?  You want to sit next to little Jimmy Norton?  Yeah.  Like a little kid.  A freak.  I want to sit next to you.  Good.  You can partake in it when he farts.  Yeah, yeah.  Our first line, our first warning.  Yeah, you're at the ground zero.  When he goes, oh, damn, I know to move.  We got to start with Billy Burr really fast.  Do you think we keep Lysol in here for any other reason?  It's Jimmy's ass.  We got to start with Billy Burr really fast because the last time I saw Billy, him and 
[03:16:00]  I were miserable backstage at the Metallica concert while this idiot was getting his stupid  photo taken.  Yes.  But it took how long, Billy?  Two hours?  Yeah, anyway.  Anyway.  And he never lost that look of longing and hopefulness that he was going to meet those  people.  Desperate nothing standing there waiting for them to come back so they could take a picture.  He stood backstage after Metallica, just letting you guys know, waiting for autographs  like some 15-year-old girl.  I know. 
[03:16:30]  And then my 15-year-old girlfriend, Billy, jumped in and was like, take one with me.  And I'm like, all right.  Well, that was at the end.  I had to.  I stood there for nine hours.  Stupid Ben is cock-blocking me so he can go do coke with some fat stripper on 44th Street.  He's like, come on, let's get out of here.  I'm like, dude, this is Lars Ulrich.  I got to get a photo.  But for once, I was with Ben.  I can understand maybe 20 minutes after a concert, we're stuck in a little room.  And then we're in the hallway.  Billy and I are looking at each other, kicking the wall like, this is insane.  Yeah.  And you got a little juice.  So there was this curtain where the band really was.  And all you had to do was walk down the hall and get past the curtain. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, yeah, three feet away.  And everybody else that was anybody, they were just going through this curtain, getting  their photos done, and getting out of there.  But you didn't want to do that because it didn't feel right.  I didn't want to get thrown out.  You can't just do that.  Is Jim Brewer bigger than you?  Jim Brewer was walking back and forth playing with their kids.  He went pumpkin picking with James Hetfield the next day.  He is that much bigger.  They know each other.  They don't know me.  I'm just a weirdo.  They went pumpkin picking with James Hetfield the next day?  Yeah, Brewer did.  Hetfield stayed at this house.  They went pumpkin picking.  But Julian and I...  Could you guys switch this conversation to hip-hop so me and Donnell could be involved? 
[03:17:30]  Charlie's got no clue what we're talking about.  I'm like, okay, I heard of Metallica, but once y'all moved past that word, I was on,  you know, in space.  You did BLS, man.  We've got to balance this out.  You did BLS?  You wasn't talking in BLS.  You were very quiet.  That's why I jumped in.  I jumped in.  I didn't say switch the subject.  We're not stupid.  Al Sharpton to George Bush.  I didn't say that.  We're not stupid.  That's why we went right for the white guy. 
[03:18:00]  We feel a little more comfortable talking to the white guy.  Right, sure.  What did you talk about on BLS?  Wait.  What did you talk about on BLS?  What did you talk about?  About our show that we've got coming up this weekend.  Yeah, you guys are at Caroline's, right?  We didn't talk about Caroline's.  I just totally guessed.  I hit the right comedy club.  Caroline's is good to us.  What are you doing for Black History Month?  What have we done for Black History Month?  That's good.  I'm being a little more...  I'm leaving one lock on my door open.  Okay.  That's an improvement. 
[03:18:30]  It's like a little thing of trust.  It's a little thing of trust.  Right, right, right.  Now I figure...  I'm actually clicking off.  I feel good about myself until lunch.  You know, now that I think about it, when I'm driving through Harlem, I actually stop  at the traffic lights.  When they're red.  Okay.  When they're red.  That's good.  That's good.  We're trying.  Very good.  Usually, man, red lights, what?  All we can hope for is an improvement, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  Jimmy, what are you doing for Black History Month?  Anything?  I made you guys not bring Billy in alone today. 
[03:19:00]  Very good.  So, who's on the show?  It's obviously Charlie, Donnell, and Billy.  Anybody else who just used to guess?  Just us.  Just three of us, man.  It's just three of us.  We've been going all over the country.  And Caroline's was actually in the beginning of the tour.  So, it's the first venue that we've doubled up on since we've been on this tour.  Now, is Chappelle's show starting this year?  Because I know there's some reduction delays.  What's going on with Chappelle's show?  Dave, you know, he got the flu.  So, on the walk in the morning. 
[03:19:30]  So, it took...  It's not a Michael Jackson excuse for something, is it?  Or he actually...  No.  He got sick of getting money.  He got sick of getting money.  He got coming down with something.  He got coming down with something.  $50 million.  A lot of germs on those bills, right?  Yeah.  But I told people, I always ask that question, man.  And I can't speak for everybody, but we're excited about working again.  But it's like, so, what's going on?  What's going on with Dave?  What is he doing?  But everybody knows he got a check for like $50 million. 
[03:20:00]  And because we don't really trust the white man too much, he's counting all his monies with singles.  Making sure it's all there, right?  Every time he gets to like $40 million, somebody from Comedy Central comes in.  He's got to start his channel.  So, as soon as it's all counted, he'll be back.  I read in the paper that they were saying something like,  he's worrying that he wants to have this season equal last season as far as being funny.  Because last season just took off and it was fantastic.  And he's having some kind of writer's block.  Yeah, yeah.  All kinds of crap.  He's having a nervous breakdown.  A nervous breakdown. 
[03:20:30]  That's all BS, man.  Yeah.  I was with Dave the other night.  Dave's fine.  He's the same person he was last season.  And we don't really have to reinvent the wheel.  All we have to do is keep doing what we've been doing.  You've got to feel a little pressure though because, I mean.  Well, of course.  I'm sure that anybody that's given a check, you know, of that amount is going to feel pressure.  Because, you know, you could be murdered over $100,000.  We gave you how much money?  And we lost our money.  You know what I'm saying?  I could have anybody kind of worried. 
[03:21:00]  But, you know, hey, I'm sure that, you know, we're going to do what we did last year.  Yeah, not just the cash.  You want to put on a good show and stuff.  And you want it to be as funny as last season.  I don't see how we can not put on a good show.  We've got the same people coming back.  Well, if we can all get writer's block, it could be a problem.  I don't get, I get writer's cop.  There you go.  That's when you tell a girl, hey, I want you to come over.  You know, Jim, let's get together, let's write and be creative.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden your dick comes out.  Yeah, she's in a comic for six months.  Yeah, it's a funny bit. 
[03:21:30]  I'll bring you on the road, you fat-to-do-do.  Yeah.  Comics are just the worst, man.  You guys are just the worst.  When you ask a girl, how long are you doing comedy?  If she says less than a year, I get clear stuff coming out.  I even tell them what...  Get in there, bro.  Get in there, yeah.  I even tell them what the...  All right, the white guy's going to talk again.  You hear that, child?  He's talking to you.  Get in there, Bill.  Come on.  No, he was talking to you.  No, I said you.  No, I said you.  He was talking to you so he could hear you.  I said bro, actually.  I said get in there, bro.  We don't use that anymore.  Come on, man. 
[03:22:00]  It's your month.  It's your month.  Oh, you want to hear some old-school black...  I still say cheddar.  Yeah.  Oh, we don't say bro.  Okay, nigga, listen.  Movie's the worst, man, with his lingo.  You think you're watching a Shaft movie.  He's got these old 70s...  I want to know how many fucking producers y'all have on this show, man.  Feels like none, most of them.  I know the strategy.  Like one.  I figured out the strategy.  Yeah?  Because producers are getting fired, like, left and right.  Yeah.  So you have, like, nine producers.  So when you've got to fire somebody, we still have, like, eight producers. 
[03:22:30]  That's true.  They're in line just in case they write a stupid tsunami song and get thrown off the air.  Well, the producers that got fired from the tsunami song used to work for us.  I know.  Yeah, he used to be on that shit.  And can I tell you, when that tsunami song, when Todd and Rick got fired, one ceiling got  dented by someone's hands pumping their fists in the air, and it was Donnell.  I'm like, when I see Donnell, I have to hug him.  Nobody was happier than Donnell.  You motherfuckers so nervous.  Any word that rhymes with tsunami, they get nervous.  They hear salami.  They're like, salami, where the fuck is the salami right now? 
[03:23:00]  We want to apologize to the Italians with the salami.  No shit.  They just keep apologizing every day, man.  Holy D.  I can't believe they bounced hot.  Salami ruined some lives, and that's tragic, but it ruined some careers, too.  Do you feel like you dug dogs to bullet by being out of there before that happened?  I mean, because obviously Donnell was on air.  Yeah.  You would have sang that song if you were there.  No, I wouldn't have sang that song.  It was hacky.  No, I would have tried to beg a couple of Asian chicks that called us the hotline, but... 
[03:23:30]  Is Miss Info as big a twat as she sounds like on the air?  No, she's good people.  She's nice.  Miss Info's good people, man.  Yeah.  When I first started there, it was kind of tight.  I think with radio, anytime you've been doing something for a while and you introduce somebody  else, it's like you've got to earn your stripes or anything like that, but after we went  through that, it was cool.  It was cool working on it.  Okay.  She sounds like the type that just gets mad at anything edgy, like anything that's remotely unpleasant.  That's awesome, man.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Miss Jones was cool?  Huh?  Miss Jones?  Yeah!  Can I tell Miss Jones to suck my penis on that? 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  You don't have to say penis.  Suck my dick!  Damn, I've been wanting to get somewhere where I can say that shit, man.  That was Ashley Larry, Miss Jones.  Oh, damn.  Charlie Murphy's still cool, Miss Jones.  Charlie likes Miss Jones, yeah.  I'm cool, yeah.  Miss Me and Miss Jones is cool, man.  Yeah.  I think she kind of, you know, backpedaled and sold them guys out.  She should have stuck up for him a little more.  Yeah.  I think she'd have been bounced on her ass if she did.  I think she was there just saving her job, but, you know, sometimes you've got to take 
[03:24:30]  the bullet.  Take the bullet and stuff.  Yeah, but she comes off like, you know, she got in there, you know, she got a couple  of people bounced, and she really didn't seem that upset about it, you know?  Company line, just took it.  And the words of Miss Jones, oh, well.  That's one of her phrases.  Oh, really?  You never heard her.  You never heard too much for this show, man.  No, I really don't listen much.  Cash rules.  Cash rules, man.  Cash rules.  Yeah.  You know, that's why she did what she did.  Cash rules.  It's business. 
[03:25:00]  It's nothing personal.  Hey, were you invited to the funeral there, Rick James?  Rick James.  Yeah, I was a pallbearer at the funeral.  You were?  Yeah.  How was that?  It was strenuous.  We had coughing pretty heavy.  I thought you meant mentally strenuous.  That bastard did get a little bit of weight, didn't he?  We had him on.  We had one of the best interviews ever, man.  He was unbelievable on our show.  Oh, totally. 
[03:25:30]  He was an unbelievable guy, man.  I'm glad to have known him.  Yeah, he was just so open and honest.  He gave some great stories.  Talking about Linda Blair.  Anything we asked him.  I'm going to tell you something about open and honest.  People like someone that's open and honest because that's showing a degree of vulnerability.  It's easy to trust somebody like that.  It's easy to trust me if I've got my hands down and I'm showing you my vulnerable spots and I'm talking to you than it is if I just come up to you like everybody else does with my guards up and all that. 
[03:26:00]  And, you know, people like the guy who's easily assessed more than someone who's guarding, you know.  And Rick was very open and he was also painfully honest.  Yeah.  He told you the truth all the time.  So that's why people like him.  Open and honest.  Like, you know, like, for instance, Rick James is one of the guys who I've never seen as fail.  Him walk up to a girl and say, bitch.  I'm Rick James, bitch.  And then it goes on from there to, you know, you know, success. 
[03:26:30]  I don't know of any other man that could do that.  And I don't think that Rick could do that to any woman, but he knew who he could do that with.  Yeah.  And that's why he never failed.  The Rick James story, you brought that, right, as well as the Prince story, which was, like, two of the biggest things on the Chappelle show that kind of, like, took you guys through the roof.  Goddamn huge, man.  How did these stories never get used anywhere before?  I mean, they're hilarious.  How did no one's entertainment friends?  They did.  They was used at Charlie Murphy's barbecues and stuff like that.  Yeah.  Charlie.  That's not what happened, man. 
[03:27:00]  He just overheard him talking shit.  Come back, man.  Literally.  Charlie, I got to ask.  I mean, what were you doing before the Chappelle show?  Because, I mean.  I was doing movies, man.  Were you really?  I was doing movies, writing movies.  TV shows.  I got to be honest.  I had no idea Eddie had a brother and, you know.  Yeah, well, you know.  He's a teen wolf.  And, obviously, hilarious.  I understand that.  You're thinking that Eddie might have gave you a little help before now.  Because now you're just blowing up.  In this business, nobody.  My understanding, my experience is that nobody really can help you. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, but you only can help yourself because, at the end of the day, I don't care who your friend is, he's not the consumer.  Right, right, right.  At the end of the day, the consumer has to like you.  So, nobody can really help you.  You have to connect yourself, you know.  So, over the years, over the last 16 years, I've been doing films.  And, you know, most of the films I was in, you know, had a huge black audience.  So, my people knew who I was.  You know what I'm saying?  My people knew who I was.  My people knew who I was. 
[03:28:00]  And, you know, and then when I got on the Chappelle show, it had the crossover audience.  Yeah.  And, bingo.  You know what I'm saying?  Did Dave just hear those stories and go, this has to be on the show?  Yeah, pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Because they're not stories that have, like, traditional punchlines.  That's what makes them so funny.  It's like, if you just heard that story.  Dave's show doesn't have a traditional anything.  Right.  That's what makes it unique and new.  You know, there's nothing traditional about his approach or the things that he chooses to make light of, you know.  So, that's why the show is where it's at. 
[03:28:30]  How did Rick feel about the...  Rick loved it, man.  That actually put Rick back on the map.  Yeah, it certainly did.  Put the light back on.  You know what I'm saying?  He was back on the road.  You know, he got the standing ovation at the BET Awards.  I mean, that whole room stood up for him.  Yeah.  It had to feel great, you know.  And he went out feeling good, you know.  And his son, at his funeral, his son let me know.  That was one of his youngest sons.  He has two of them.  The youngest one let me know.  That was his favorite thing to watch on television.  So, I feel good about, you know, us being able to do that together before he passed. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Now, it's hysterical to watch and stuff.  But, I mean, if the story's accurate, which I assume it is, it must not have been...  If the story's accurate, Rick would be dead.  Yeah, you got to exaggerate.  I mean, from, you know, from Charlie Murphy, I'll be in jail for murder.  That's what I'm going to say.  I mean, at the time, if that stuff really happened, you had it, you would have killed him.  Exactly.  So, what? 
[03:29:30]  You have to also understand this.  You have my story, and then you have the talent of Dave Chappelle, man.  But Charlie's story's never true, man.  No?  We're going to change the name from True Hollywood Story to Charlie Murphy Lies, man.  Because you can't find anybody to...  Well, Paul Mooney...  Paul Mooney just said that killed all that.  That killed all that.  Yeah, but he didn't know him for you.  You paid him money for you.  Exactly.  No, I didn't pay anybody money.  That's what I'm trying to get you two young bucks to understand.  Paul Mooney knew me for years.  You guys just met me.  That's why I got to keep getting you guys a little glimpse. 
[03:30:00]  Because sometimes, I don't think you'll realize who you're talking to.  And you put your health on the line.  You know what we're talking to.  We're talking to the Tony Montana of comedy, man.  You put your health on the line.  You know what I'm saying?  You come out of your face.  You say different things.  Charlie's a bully.  And then they have to...  No one's really coming at him.  You know what it was?  Add it up in dollars and cents.  Is it worth it?  He's got his lawyer's number.  He's so...  He's always coming at that...  He spent six months in jail for...  Would you...  Shoplifted at, like, Staples or something like that?  He's just been...  Ever since then, his whole attitude, man.  You just say hello to him, and he, like... 
[03:30:30]  Prison mentality.  He's got his chest out and shit.  We just...  We like you, Charlie.  We've been on the road for eight months, man.  You know?  Bullying people around.  I do what works for me, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Bullying.  No, I ain't no bully, man.  I got three sons.  I got three sons.  It's a dangerous combination.  You know karate?  What?  You know karate?  I don't want to talk about that on the air, man.  Oh.  I'll just say this.  I handle mine.  These guys know. 
[03:31:00]  That's how karate people do.  These guys been on the road with me.  That was the ghetto version of the Peaceful Warrior.  Accident of the...  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I handle my business, man.  I don't have no security guards, and I don't have a big fence around my house, and I ain't  worried about it.  See, that's the funniest thing about him.  That's right.  That's his vibe the whole time.  One time we tried to do a question and answer thing after like a college show, and he was  just intimidating the shit out of every student there. 
[03:31:30]  They would be like, Mr. Murphy, what's it like working with Dave?  And he goes, yo, I just answered that.  Won't you listen?  Aren't you paying attention?  I guess it's a congressional hearing or something.  That was brutal.  After two questions, everyone was afraid to ask another one.  All right, let's go to the phone.  Well, you know, that was the end of the night.  I want to go home, man.  Yeah, let's say how to Mike in Dallas.  Hey, Mike.  What's that, man?  Hey, Charlie.  How'd you ever hook up with Snoop for the Murder Was a Case video?  Oh, you know, game.  Recognize game, man.  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:32:00]  They seen me in some films that I did, and Dr. Drake called me up, and that was it.  We did Murder Was a Case.  It just had bad timing because, you know, Snoop actually got in trouble around that time.  Murder really was a case.  Murder really was a case.  That was no joke, man.  And then they had to, you know, just go straight to the blockbuster with the DVD, but that was  a great video, man.  Oh, hey, Charlie.  Yeah.  You gotcha.  Get this guy.  That's just one of our things we do. 
[03:32:30]  I don't want to piss Charlie off, but I'm going to explain it to him.  Yeah, right?  Ricky, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up, ONA?  What's up, Sweet Chess?  How you doing?  Hello, sir.  I just want to ask, Charlie, if the Rick James stuff is going to make it to the second season  box set, and if my man could also give me a, I'm rich, biatch.  Oh, yeah.  The Rick James stuff is not only going to make it to the second season box set.  It's going to contain a lot of stuff that wasn't shown.  You know, we didn't have enough.  You're going to see all of the stuff. 
[03:33:00]  So that's a very big reason to buy it.  And as far as the I'm rich, biatch, that's my man, Ashley Larry.  You got to hit that.  I don't normally do it for guys, but if your girlfriend or wife is anywhere around, I'm  rich, biatch!  I'll back it up.  All right, very nice.  By the way, what kind of question is that?  How could the Rick James stuff not be on?  No, we're going to leave off the biggest thing on the show.  No, it's not going to be on there, sir.  It's everything but the Rick James shit.  No sketch stuff.  Yeah, it's all the skits that didn't work.  It's only Dave's stand-up in between. 
[03:33:30]  That's all that's on the whole thing.  Mario from the city.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to say I was a big fan of Charlie Murphy and Grand Theft Auto.  His character, Jizzy, was hysterical.  Thank you, man.  Thanks a lot.  You know, my kids is using that to get back at me, though, man.  Whenever I testize them, they go downstairs and kill Jizzy.  I had another question.  You're in Grand Theft Auto, too, right?  Yeah, Anthony and I.  Yeah, yeah.  Are you in the latest game?  The latest one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  He's Jizzy.  Jizzy B.  I'm Jizzy B, man.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That is the best part, when he starts smacking the holes and then chopping up the hook.  Getting that pimp.  Charlie, we're...  Yeah.  Charlie, Anthony, and I are also in GTA.  All right.  So we got an alumni going.  Well, yeah, we're heard so late in the game that it's at the point where everyone gives up on the game.  Most people don't make it through that far.  I think I'm the last phone call to a talk station.  Don't you say something about udders? 
[03:34:30]  Utders?  Milking.  Milking.  You're on some Viagra commercial or something?  No, that's not me.  No, I play a burnout.  Oh.  Talking about dinosaurs and cavemen and stuff on a talk show.  No one has heard...  I didn't hear Anthony on it, though.  I talk about sex in the church, believe it or not.  Yeah, no one has really heard us because we're so late in the game.  But that's cool.  All right, thanks.  Later, guys.  I didn't know we were talking to Jizzy, man.  That's pretty cool.  Jizzy B, man.  Jeremy from Jersey.  What's up, Jeremy?  Hey, what's up?  I was talking with one of my friends about Charlie. 
[03:35:00]  He said, hey, did you see Dave Chappelle's Rick James?  Rick James.  He was like, yeah, yeah, I really like that.  What did you think?  I said, yeah, that was pretty good.  And he was like, yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  What a complete tool.  See, it doesn't work with comics, you idiot.  Jeremy from Maryland.  What's up?  Hey, Charlie.  I heard something about you getting into an argument with a bouncer in L.A. or something.  It was in the paper.  It said right here, and I quote, Charlie from the Chappelle show said, go see Jim Norton in 
[03:35:30]  Houston Improv.  I had him.  I had him.  I knew it.  I said, here it comes.  Guys are killing us with all our gags today.  I'm sorry.  That's a gag?  They call up and they plug my shows everywhere.  Our callers are tools.  They'll call up with something and say they want to talk about a certain subject, go into  it, and it could be anything.  It could be about a plane crash.  And you're really into the story, like, oh, wow, this is a good one.  Oh, they're making it up.  And the last thing the pilot said over the speaker was, see Jim Norton at the Improv. 
[03:36:00]  And they plug his gags.  I seem to be the only one that really enjoys this gag.  I wouldn't be too upset if I was you.  I'm very happy.  These guys hate it.  I hate it.  I think it's hysterically funny when I don't know it's coming, but now it's getting obvious  where the guy's like, all right, you know it.  Yeah, I was sitting here thinking, like, a bouncy in L.A.  You must be talking about a real old story.  Yeah, let's go to the phone.  Check it.  Hopefully there's a real question from Payday in Cleveland. 
[03:36:30]  Payday.  Hey, what's up, Charlie?  I loved you at CB4.  What's up, Payday?  Hey, you guys did a skit, Run Up With The Real World.  Who wrote that?  Was that you or was it somebody else?  No, that was actually Dave and Neil Brennan.  Oh, that was a...  Yeah, that was my first sketch on the show, and that's what led to me being, you know...  Yeah, what was that skit about again?  What was the twist?  It was like a spoof on the real world.  No, I know, but what was the twist?  The twist was it was, instead of it being a house full of white people with one black 
[03:37:00]  person, it was a house full of black people with one white person.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Christian Finnegan.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was funny.  Oh, is that Christian?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, hilarious.  He got fucking his girlfriend and all this stuff.  Yeah, right in front of him?  Yeah.  You fucked him, too.  Oh, yeah.  You fucked Chris, too.  Yeah.  What was the favorite skit to do?  Oh, that's fantastic.  What was the favorite skit you guys did?  I mean, Charlie would probably say the Rick James, but... 
[03:37:30]  You got one, Darno?  The one, I don't know, I like the World Series, but my favorite sketch was the Wayne  Brady sketch.  The Wayne Brady?  Yeah.  That Wayne Brady sketch.  Oh, God damn.  That's a pleasure.  It was funny, and it was...  I mean, I do the warm-ups for the show, and it was like, it was one part when Wayne gets  out of the car, and he starts singing that stupid song, and then my family's not going  to believe it, because they'll never find out and he twists his neck.  I don't know, man.  Call me crazy, but every time the audience didn't know that was coming, when I saw it  and they was disgusted, I was like, yes.  That neck cracker, when people can laugh at somebody's neck being cracked, that's got 
[03:38:00]  to be history, man.  But the twist in that sketch was so funny, because you couldn't predict what was going  on.  Yeah.  That's like my favorite sketch to watch.  That's a good one.  I enjoyed doing the World Series of Dice.  World Series of Dice is funny.  The Ashley Larry thing is really doing it for me now.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm selling lotion next year.  I'm going to be first person to go platinum with lotion.  I got a poster for you, too, Jim.  All right, good.  All right.  Yeah, I'm waiting for a character on the show to do it for me.  People keep coming up to me going, are you a producer?  I'll hide there.  Somebody out here goes, are you like the publicist? 
[03:38:30]  The worst one I got, we were on the road and somebody goes, are you from Pittsburgh?  Like, I was like the local white guy just opening up for us, just like Jesus.  Billy, you had one of my favorite moments on the show, and it's such a little silly  moment, but I think it's the racial, what was that one?  The racial draft.  That's one of the funniest things ever on television, the racial draft with blacks, whites, the  Chinese, everyone takes certain people for their race.  You know, it's like people like Mariah Carey, you know, like, what are you?  People get sick of arguing. 
[03:39:00]  They have, like, a racial draft, like the NFL draft, that each race gets to pick, and  if you get chosen, whatever race that is, that's what you're going to be.  So, yeah, who's going to claim Tiger Woods, blacks or Asians, you know, so they tell  that.  We're the O.J., though.  O.J. kept going back.  No one wanted O.J.  Well, who did white people not get where you and the other white announcer, they do this  little thing, it's real quick, and you can't see it on radio, where they just take their  fingers, and they do that little fingertip touch.  Oh, they didn't know O.J. became black again. 
[03:39:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you guys, just the little fingertip tap, and then right back to the dialogue.  Yeah, that was so crazy, because there was something else in there, a line that I thought  was going to get a huge laugh, and it got nothing, and that thing I thought was going  to be a throwaway, and everybody was like, yo, that was funny as hell.  I didn't know what they were talking about, because it was, like, so quick.  When we finally watched it, I was like, oh, all right.  That makes me laugh every time I see it.  I don't know why.  It's just silly, but it's perfect.  I like shooting the dog on that Law & Order sketch, but they did it real quick, so I  don't think people knew it was me.  Is that because you used to really do that when you was a kid, Bill?  Why are you going to put that on me, man? 
[03:40:00]  I know about you.  You told me you used to kill animals when you were young.  No, I didn't.  That is the wrong way to serial kill it.  For real, man.  He's got this little dog.  I'm telling you, this guy right here, this guy right here, I'm telling you, he's hiding  behind his smile and all that's fake, man.  He's a sociopath, man.  I don't like him because I'm white.  Yes.  He tells me stories all the time about how I used to pull the legs off the daddy long legs,  and stick a needle through him and burn him.  None of that's true.  Burn the carcass.  He's trying to shut me up because he actually has a warrant right now because his little  dog, evidently he's abused it so much. 
[03:40:30]  He just opened the door and this little thing ran across the street and bit somebody's leg.  That's because...  It has nothing to do with me, man.  He wasn't threatened.  It has nothing to do with me, man.  That's the dog's behavior.  The dog was mean.  Have been beating it.  The dog was mean.  The dog was mean.  You told me you put it in a pillowcase.  You know how to smoke.  Put it in a pillowcase.  He does.  And he beats it with a broomstick.  Anytime he bombs, he comes home, he's angry, he's got to take it out on something.  Every night.  Every night.  Every time we get off the road, he's got to beat it for eight shows worth of bombing. 
[03:41:00]  It was real slick how you tried to put that on me.  Oh, that's funny.  That's rough, man.  I put him in a pillowcase.  I put him in a pillowcase.  I forgot what movie I was in with, you know, I laughed in an inappropriate time.  Oh, Jesus.  The movie I was in with.  Wait, what did he say?  He said everybody forgot what movie you were in.  I was watching a movie, right?  He said it.  Don't look at me like that.  Try it.  Hey, you know what?  I don't know how he even can come with that.  The only movie you ever was in was Spider-Man 2, and you had two words.  So I think you need to shut up. 
[03:41:30]  That was a lovely episode.  Nobody called in yet.  What were the two words?  Spider-Man stole that guy's pizza.  Oh, okay.  Five words.  I like that.  You got to get on the mic.  I started the first 20 seconds.  That's the only movie that you was ever in, and probably the last one.  I told you, man, you've been blacklisted, man.  But Charlie, just Charlie.  You've been blacklisted.  I'm telling you.  We've been doing it, like, with the tour and everything, every city we went to, we've  had, like, a Shabba Ranks look-alike contest, and Charlie's won.  The only person who's ever done it in 50 states, so we want to give him a round of applause. 
[03:42:00]  And we've also held a drunken Nick Van Exel look-alike contest.  Nick Van Exel, after rehab.  When his NBA money's gone.  When his NBA money's gone, he's on steroids, and he has a bad liver.  I don't do steroids.  He looks like Donnell.  That's how Nick Van Exel would look.  Or medication.  All right.  Van Exel never made it to the NBA.  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  Okay.  All right.  I had to add that last one.  You want to keep messing with that?  Let's go to Mike in Texas.  Mike.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Good.  Hi.  What's up, Mike?  Damn.  My favorite character is Buck Nasty.  Okay.  What's going on, baby?  Oh, my God.  I had surgery on my spine last March, and I was laying in bed for two months, and I had  a season one DVD.  I couldn't watch it.  I was in so much pain, I had to put off watching the DVDs for a whole month.  Oh, wow, man.  When is season two coming out? 
[03:43:00]  April 21st is supposed to be the first air day for the first show.  But it's coming, baby.  You're talking about season two DVD, it'll be coming out around the same time as the season  three air day.  I hope you guys get a piece of season two, because season one, well, you don't know how  it was going to go, but season two was just smash.  I hope they're giving you guys something from the DVD.  Yeah, you guys all renegotiate a little bit?  Yeah, we got money.  Do you all right?  Good, you should.  You get a little something-something, right?  Not that you tell money, though.  You get some...  You get some...  You get some...  You get some level, man.  Yeah, I didn't catch pneumonia, put it that way.  No. 
[03:43:30]  Pat from Boston.  What's up, Pat?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Cold-blooded.  I just wanted to know if Charlie and Ashley Larry ever have to wait in line when they  go to Six Flags, or if they can just kind of get up to the front because they're dark.  I haven't been to Six Flags in a minute, man, but I don't mind waiting in line.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't mind if that's what I have to do.  I don't mind. 
[03:44:00]  If somebody recognizes me so you can move to the front of the line, cool.  But if not, I don't make a big deal about it.  You just made a big deal at the door, but I'm standing in line to get on this show.  Wait, what happened?  What?  At the door.  We had to stand in line to get on this show.  We had to show our ID, birth certificate.  Yeah, but we up at the radio station, and I was told to come up here and do it.  We had to get fingerprints, blood, DNA, and stuff.  Yeah, what was up with all that, man?  How long did it take you guys to sign?  We've been having an ongoing thing with this, with guests coming in and taking...  It takes too long for them to get in.  How long did it take you guys to sign in?  We had to get mugshot, fingerprint, give them my ID.  Yeah, it's just weird to have somebody take your license and walk away. 
[03:44:30]  They swabbed Darnell's gums and shit.  I wasn't letting them do that to me, man.  That's all I got to do with a radio interview, man.  It's the weirdest thing, but sometimes it takes up to 40 minutes to get through the security.  Did they take photos of you guys or no?  No, they didn't take photos.  No, they took photocopies of our ID.  It's incredible, man.  Photocopies of the photo ID.  You guys had to wait?  You guys are big stars now.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  I'm the publisher.  I asked the guy, I said, do you know who I am? 
[03:45:00]  He said, yes, now give me your ID.  You guys are selling out everywhere, man.  You guys, it's like one of the hottest tours of these guys.  Oh, we had, it's phenomenal, man.  You know, I just started doing stand-up last Father's Day, okay?  And, uh...  It shows.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy.  That's brutal.  You know what?  You know what?  I let them get that off because if you come to my show, that's all I got, that's all I have to do to answer that.  But, because my show is very tight, okay?  And I hang out with the best of the best, which are these two guys right here. 
[03:45:30]  You know, we first started going out on the road.  They used to say, oh, yes, you are getting...  He used to say that at every radio interview.  If you come to the show, you're going to get two quality headliners and...  Price of one.  ...and Charlie Murphy.  He don't say that no more.  Because, you know, the proof of the point is when you come see the show.  Two headliners and a middle.  At the price of one.  Now he says two headliners and a star.  That's what he says.  The star of the show.  It's just always with that prison vibe. 
[03:46:00]  You just can't get them to light up.  It's not a prison vibe.  It's me, man.  Yeah, you're very intimidating there, Charlie.  Come on, man.  I don't got no steak razor cuts on my face or nothing, man.  I'm just sitting here talking, man.  You're intimidating.  Very intimidating.  Did you find it rough to get into stand-up, or?  Tell them, tell them.  It was pretty easy.  Wait a minute.  Tell them who's responsible, Charlie.  This is one moment.  I'm going to tell you how it all happened.  Be honest, Charlie.  I'm going to be honest.  Who's responsible for your comedy career?  I had this gentleman over here on a daily basis assaulting me with, you know, his belief 
[03:46:30]  that I was afraid to stand in front of a live audience and do stand-up.  That's not a crazy fear, though.  You know?  No, but what I'm saying is, you know, the way he kept, you know, he's a comedian, so he  had, like, bits and everything.  I would walk in the room.  So we'd have a whole bit about the mic that's made of Kryptonite, and Charlie Murphy's tough,  but he'd pull out the Kryptonite and pull the microphone out.  If Charlie Murphy ever says he's going to kick your ass, just pull the mic out and run.  Until finally, I was like, this guy must really think that I'm afraid. 
[03:47:00]  Nice.  So I went down one night, went up to the Laugh Factory, and the reaction that I got encouraged  me to keep doing it, and I've been doing it ever since.  So it's all because of Billy Burr?  Did you write material or just get up there and...  Say what?  Did you write material or just decide you're going to get up there and win?  Well, initially, when I first started doing it, my material was just talking about me,  my life.  My life is...  I've lived a funny, funny life, and I've had some interesting experiences during it.  So that's...  I just talked about the things that I've experienced, and it worked. 
[03:47:30]  And then I was able to mold that from going...  Because after that first time I went on stage, I started going on every night, two, three times  a night, working.  And these two guys went with me.  They took me to different rooms, let me work out, and I was able to progress pretty  quickly.  Because that's one of the most important things with a young stand-up is getting able to  even be on the stage.  And because of these guys, I was able to get on stage every night.  You know, and not just get like, okay, we're going to let you go on for five minutes.  They would let me go on stage for 15, as long as I want to stay on. 
[03:48:00]  Because you wouldn't get off the stage, John.  I'm just saying, that's what helped me...  That's what helped me progress to where I'm at right now.  You know what I'm saying?  And that's a very good place.  We have a very strong show, a very solid show.  There's no holes in it.  And we've been doing well everywhere we went, and we can go back everywhere we've been.  When does Caroline start?  When do you guys actually start at Caroline's?  Tonight, right?  No, no, tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  We got it tomorrow through Sunday.  Tonight, we're going down to Camden and the Rutgers.  You know, so we'll be back here tomorrow to do Caroline's for the weekend. 
[03:48:30]  I did Rutgers-Camden many years ago.  Didn't go particularly well for me.  No?  No, not at all.  Why?  You don't seem like a college actor.  Because the MC, there was like three white people there, and I was one of them.  And the MC was black, and he went on and goes,  Y'all beat him like Reginald Denny.  After I came off.  I just took my check and went home.  Wow.  Yeah, it didn't go particularly well at Rutgers-Camden for me.  But if you're down there or at Caroline's, I remember the number, 212-757-4100.  You guys are doing two Saturday, two Friday, one Sunday, one Sunday. 
[03:49:00]  Oh, you're doing three Saturday?  Three.  On Friday, three Saturday, and two Sunday.  Wow, that means that tickets are selling if they're letting you do three Saturday, three Friday.  Oh, the tickets are selling.  Yeah, of course.  The people in the Trusted area have been very supportive of us.  You know, up in Boston, we even had a sellout during the last Big Blizzard.  And people came out to the midnight show.  In racially sensitive Boston?  Racially sensitive Boston came out to the midnight show.  It was a school project. 
[03:49:30]  It was a midnight show.  See, look at them.  They eat.  They breathe.  God damn Boston, man.  No, they actually just took pictures of you guys shaking hands with Billy.  They couldn't believe that that actually happened in society.  That's what helped and allowed us that Bill is from Boston, you know?  Yeah.  I don't know if we can repeat that because I had to expose that Bill is a fake Boston Red Sox fan.  That's not true.  He's also a fake Patriots fan.  That's not true.  For anybody out there that is listening, his hat that he has on is staker.  He lives in Jersey, and they don't have a team. 
[03:50:00]  Keep winning.  Slow down with the Sox, at least.  No, the Patriots.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they do.  You know, the Red Sox won last year.  They're upset about it.  That's all I'm talking about.  He's not a true fan.  Trust me.  We was in the room with him when he was putting his stuff in the garbage and all of that.  We've seen him do it.  I had the normal reaction when we went down three games to nothing, and it was 19-8.  And then he threw his hat in the garbage.  I was like, you know what?  I had it.  I was like, I had it.  And you threw your hat in the garbage.  Stop exaggerating.  You threw your hat in the garbage.  You threw his hat in the garbage.  You just went on a 20-minute speech about how honest you are. 
[03:50:30]  You threw his hat in the garbage.  Here you are.  He threw his hat in the garbage.  Come on.  I thought you come from the heart.  You don't have to guard down.  We was down in Missouri.  He threw his hat in the garbage.  Never had to.  And the next day, he had the limo driver, drive him back to the venue, and he went to the  dumpster behind the venue and got the hat back out.  I remember that, too.  You remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you know what?  When I looked in there, Charlie was in the dumpster because the crowd threw him in there  for the first 20 minutes.  God damn.  That is funny. 
[03:51:00]  I would tend to believe that, though, because a lot of the Boston fans, our own band over  here is the biggest Boston fan ever, and he has always given up.  When you lose your daddy, it was a prison rape.  Yeah, it really was.  It was just like, I don't know what the hell happened.  I was shell-shocked as a Yankee fan that, you know, we got trashed after that.  Hey, man, you know, hey, the Yankees, they ain't going nowhere.  Yeah, they'll be back.  That's right.  I think they'll do well.  The curse will be reinstated, trust me.  I didn't even mind losing to the Red Sox.  How can you reinstate a curse?  It's over, man.  By whipping Boston's ass. 
[03:51:30]  That's it.  Don't you live in Jersey?  You guys don't have a team, do you?  I'm from New York, and I live in Jersey.  So I cheer for Boston.  I mean, I cheer for New York and New Jersey.  Those are my people.  You didn't say that when we were in Boston.  I did say that in Boston.  I brought him up.  I went in front.  Keep it going for Charlie.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Big Yankee fan.  Right.  And they started boating.  He froze like a cartoon.  That's the worst thing you could say.  No, but then, you know what's funny?  He went on and told that lie about me so well.  He had my old mother coming up, like, did you really throw your hat out? 
[03:52:00]  I'm like, no.  He's lying.  That's not what his mother said to him.  His mother's exact words was, he got the best of your belly.  See that?  Nobody believed it.  They don't want to believe it.  That was his mother's.  Why?  Why would they stick up with Charlie?  Oh, you know what?  Now listen to this one.  Oh, here it is.  This is funny.  He told me that his mother never heard of James Brown.  Do you believe that?  No, no, no.  Do you believe that?  It's impossible.  Until his brother.  Listen to me.  Would you shut up?  Until his brother did that bit about him. 
[03:52:30]  With the hot tub.  In Delirious.  We're talking early 80s.  This is way before BET.  Way before Basic Cable.  What shows was James Brown on that my parents did?  Ed Sullivan.  My parents watched Lawrence Welk, though.  Ed Sullivan.  They watched Lawrence Welk religiously.  They watched Ed Sullivan, too.  I'm sure your parents watched it.  I must say, up in Boston, though, they probably didn't.  Yeah, they blocked it.  There's no black people.  You were telling me that I feel good it wasn't playing up in Boston.  Boston's like a whole other galaxy when it comes to black people.  They didn't play Sex Machine in Boston.  Boston, it's like a racist San Francisco. 
[03:53:00]  That's what it is.  Same size, just no openness.  If you live there right now, you'd be in Roxbury.  Yep.  It's just all segregated.  They have their borders.  No one crosses them.  They have their Asian area, the Italian area, the black area,  the white Irish.  As opposed to down here where everybody's all mixed up.  A melting pot.  And nobody up there listens to James Brown.  Pretends to get along.  I'm sure there are a few people.  I don't believe that, man.  Go into the attic like Anne Frank and turn on the record, you know,  listen to some James Brown.  Make sure their white friends don't hear them listening to that. 
[03:53:30]  Wow.  My mother bought me my first record.  She bought me a sing-along with Mitch Miller and the gang.  By the Lions.  Mitch Miller.  Mitch Miller.  Yeah.  Great.  Sitting alone with Mitch Miller and the gang.  And the gang.  Yeah.  The big hits, Won't You Come Home, Bill Bailey.  I mean, you know how far away from James Brown that is.  Light years, man.  She probably heard his stuff at a party or something and didn't know it was him.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I feel good. 
[03:54:00]  How do you know you've had to have that life?  How do you not have heard that?  But what I'm saying is...  I'm with Charlie.  I'm with Charlie.  Come on.  But look, if James Brown came up the walk, she would lock the door.  She wouldn't know who he was.  I'm not saying your mother recognized James Brown.  I'm saying your mother danced to his music before.  She would lock the front door.  What about the back door?  Why are you always going to make it some interracial story?  Black history, mother.  Black history, mother.  That really should have been offensive.  You just said my mother would...  I'm offensive.  I've been on the show for years. 
[03:54:30]  I don't know if we're going to...  Wait, he said his mother would...  That's going across the line.  Wait, what happened?  What happened?  I wouldn't disrespect your mother.  He's got the rest of the month.  I think you should punch him in the face for that, Bill.  The rest of the month, he can say whatever he wants.  All right.  I think you should punch him in the face for that, Bill.  You probably think I should do that.  Yeah.  You're into violence.  If you're a real man, if you're a real man, I think you should handle it.  I'm not trying to terminate you.  I'm trying to guide you to victory and glory.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did we accomplish anything here? 
[03:55:00]  Nah.  No?  How much time we got left in this office?  Two minutes.  Two minutes to go.  Two minutes?  All right.  Damn, time flies.  Gentlemen, thanks for dropping in, man.  Hey, man.  Thanks for having us, man.  It was a blast.  Definitely a pisser.  Now, listen.  You guys are coming out show, right?  I'll go.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Keep the license.  We're going to be looking for you, man.  I'll definitely be there.  And I'll stop backstage and say hi to prove I was there.  I can't wait to see you guys.  It's at Caroline's tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Three shows tomorrow, three shows Saturday, two shows Sunday. 
[03:55:30]  Caroline's 212-757-4100.  These shows will sell out.  And I'm not just saying that because I know them, but because it makes me sick every fucking  city I go into.  They were here.  They sold three shows.  I got fucking eight people in the audience.  I just want to bite the three of you.  But they do sell out everywhere.  So buy tickets now.  Don't be an idiot.  Just walk up.  Get them before you go.  Yeah, right on.  And the season starts April 21st.  April 21st.  And the box set will be out.  New stuff will be out.  That's right.  Season two, right around that same time, too, right?  All right.  All right.  That's right.  Come on and hang out with Charlie Murphy, Donnell Rollins, and Bill Burr. 
[03:56:00]  Bravo.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I don't know what we did, but it seemed funny.  Yeah, that was what we always do.  It's all good.  Damn time today, that's for sure.  I learned Charlie's very intimidating, but seems like a nice guy.  I'm not intimidating, man.  Y'all don't understand that.  I'm not intimidating.  I don't see any, yeah, nothing intimidating.  The guy's got his personality.  That's how he is.  Family man, daddy.  All right.  But it does feel like these two are like anime around Ike when Charlie talks. 
[03:56:30]  That is kind of the vibe I get.  Like, you know, we're happy he's smiling now.  He's smiling now.  Damn.  I didn't like that shit, Jim.  I'll see you outside.  All right.  We'll see you guys at Caroline's.  Billy, any final thoughts?  Nothing?  Uh, no.  Nothing, really.  Go Sox.  I'm supposed to, like, wrap it up?  Yeah.  No, you don't have it.  Definitely.  We only have, like, ten seconds.  We're just, this is just called filler.  Yeah, we're just chit-chatting until the, it actually stops.  Well, that would be the glazed-over look in your eye right now.  Yeah. 
[03:57:00]  Four, three, two, one.  Touch it.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, then, Willie, can I help you?  Oh, yeah, I'd like to see, is there a way I can find out which date that I applied for  a loan?  You want to find out when you applied for your loan?  Yeah, the date that I applied.  You took out a loan with us?  Yeah.  Uh, look on your calendar.  On my what?  Look on your damn calendar.  Why can't you look on your calendar? 
[03:57:30]  Well, what kind of fucking customer service representative you, is you telling me to look  at a calendar?  Hey, don't be talking to me that way, bitch.  I just asked you to tell you to look on your calendar.  You don't know when the hell you took out your loan?  What's your loan number?  I'll look it up for you.  None of your fucking business, you faggot-ass pig.  And that's why you're working in customer service.  Kiss my hairy ass.  You're sitting on your fat, lazy, stinking, nasty behind that you're six dollars an hour.  And you think you want to talk to this kind of gibberish?  You're going to step in the wind. 
[03:58:00]  Buying rubbers has to be the most embarrassing thing in the world for guys.  And the second most embarrassing thing is when we're going to the supermarket and the girl  goes, hey, listen, since you're already going to the store, could you buy me a bottle  of that water and vinegar stuff?  And you'll buy like 55 items and that computer scanner will read every one except this one thing.  It's a...  Price check.  I think it was ten bucks. 
[03:58:30]  Ten bucks?  There's no way this is ten dollars.  I'll pay 20 to swing it up right now.  We can't charge you 20 dollars for this.  Price check on this one quart water and vinegar douche.  Forget it.  I don't want the douche.  Forget it.  He doesn't want the douche.  I remember once I went to buy rubbers.  I'm waiting in line.  Get up to the counter.  The druggist walks away and this girl comes up.  Hi, can I help you?  Can I talk to him for a minute?  She said, why? 
[03:59:00]  You want to buy rubbers?  Bill, come here.  I think he wants to buy rubbers.  People are looking at me like, aren't you the douche guy from the supermarket?
