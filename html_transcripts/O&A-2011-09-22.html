<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, hosted by Sam Roberts in the absence of Opie and Anthony due to the Sandy Cain lawsuit, was a chaotic blend of legal anxieties, celebrity interviews, shocking personal anecdotes, and unrestrained vulgarity.  The show opened with a review of the absurd lawsuit filed by Sandy Cain, a geriatric stripper who had participated in numerous humiliating stunts on the show.  Videos of these stunts were shown, highlighting Cain’s apparent enjoyment despite her claims of injury and “doctor bills” resulting from a broken guitar and various substances thrown at her.  The staff debated the merits of the lawsuit and potential counter-suit strategies, with Kenny, acting as their lawyer, gathering evidence.  Scheduled guests included Jim Norton, Levi Johnston (Bristol Palin’s ex), and Brittany Andrews (Penthouse).

The show also tackled heavier topics, notably the Troy Davis execution, sparking a passionate debate amongst the hosts and callers regarding the death penalty, witness testimony reliability, and systemic biases in the justice system. Callers shared personal stories of violent crimes against their families, expressing frustration with the legal system's failures, including wrongful convictions and the release of dangerous individuals like Thomas Trantino.  One caller made a vulgar comment about Sam Roberts’ mother.  The show also featured a fictional, darkly humorous account of Opie and Anthony’s deaths via a “tragic edging accident,” followed by a “fuck you” segment featuring obscene messages from listeners.

The in-studio guests, Brittany Andrews and Levi Johnston, arrived, resulting in a shift to lighter, albeit still sexually explicit, topics.  The conversation unexpectedly veered into a graphic discussion of crabs (pubic lice), with shared experiences and humorous anecdotes from the hosts and callers. This was followed by a discussion of the lawsuit, with Kenny calling in to confirm Anthony had spent the night in New York City.  Another segment featured crude humor about body hair and ethnic stereotypes, alongside speculation about Jonah Hill's absence as a guest.  The lack of a proper show website and video capabilities was also lamented, highlighting missed opportunities like the inability to fully utilize footage from an Amy Schumer interview.  Further listener calls about crabs and a caller’s experiences with prostitutes and crabs ensued.  The hosts also discussed their individual side projects and upcoming appearances by Andrews and Johnston.

The show then featured a lengthy interview with Levi Johnston about his relationship with Bristol Palin, his experiences with the Palin family, and the subsequent media coverage, including his appearance in Playgirl and various pornography offers.  Johnston discussed specific incidents and anecdotes, addressing untrue media reports and his legal battles with the Palin family. He also shared his feelings about Sarah Palin, McCain, and Obama. This interview was interspersed with sexually explicit banter involving the hosts and guests, Kristen and Brittany Andrews, focusing on various sexual acts and body parts.  Brittany Andrews described using a strap-on dildo.

Brittany Andrews and Kristen Davis (a former madam who ran for governor) were then interviewed, resulting in a highly sexually explicit discussion of BDSM, sexual roleplay, and various fetishes.  Brittany detailed her experiences in the adult film industry, including specific sexual acts, props, and preferences.  Jimmy Norton also participated, mentioning a handjob given under the table.  The segment included promotion for Brittany's DJ work and an upcoming party.  Roland, a production staff member, discussed the challenges of his job.  The focus later shifted to the show’s interns, particularly Intern David and Bobo, with derogatory comments made about their personalities and a discussion of Bobo's prank call and relationship with Kurt Lowe.  Intern David’s unexpected encounter at the 9/11 Memorial was also mentioned. Speculation about the motivations and relationships of various individuals was rife, including potential manipulation and self-promotion.  Roland's sleeping habits and reactions when woken were also discussed.  The show concluded with the mention of upcoming guests JB Smoove and Chris Cornell.  Throughout the broadcast, the absurd and ironic nature of the Sandy Cain lawsuit remained a recurring theme.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's O.P. and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Anthony show.  You got a guy.  Hey, it's Larry King.  Welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM satellite.  Oh, fuck yeah.  This place is insane.  You guys like to cuss on that.  Yeah, a lot.  It's a weird show.  Great guests.  Interesting interviews.  And of course, your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened  to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it.  The show is so disorganized.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre. 
[00:04:00]  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying this.  Well, then turn off.  God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumbass.  We're experts.  We already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one  of the highlights of my career, the Opie and Anthony show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  This sounds different. 
[00:04:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Without Opie or Anthony, my name is Sam Roberts.  Everybody else is here.  Jim will be here.  We are doing a live show, ladies and gentlemen.  There's no reason for you to go anywhere else because Opie and Anthony are not here today  because they're involved in the biggest court case in quite some time.  I mean, every news channel that you go to from last night into this morning is talking about this case. 
[00:05:00]  It's one of the biggest things to happen, legally speaking, in quite some time.  Not only in pop culture, but, I mean, it's across CNN.  It's across the Morning Joe right now is just talking about it.  There are people lined up outside the courthouses with signs protesting because Opie and Anthony  are somehow entangled in this court case.  And by this court case, I mean, of course, the Sandy Cain lawsuit. 
[00:05:30]  Sandy Cain, as we all know by now, is the geriatric stripper who's been part of the Opie and Anthony show for some time.  She's been coming in for years and years and doing humiliating things,  but they're things that not only did she volunteer for, but she was paid for and enjoyed doing so much  that she admitted on the air that she enjoyed it and came back for more every time.  Time and time again.  Danny's here.  Travis is here.  Troy is here.  E-Rock's here.  Kenny's outside collecting evidence this morning because Kenny is acting somehow. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know how this worked out, but he is acting as Opie and Anthony's attorney in this case.  I've never seen a man wear as many hats as Kenny, but he's gone from officer of the law to security professional here at Sirius XM  to now attorney, Club Soda Kenny.  So he'll be representing Opie and Anthony in this case against Sandy Cain.  Now, apparently she has filed a lawsuit against Opie and Anthony because Opie smashed her guitar 
[00:06:30]  and because Opie and Anthony made her get doctor bills.  And she actually so professionally phrased it on the summons, doctor bills.  What doctor bills?  I would love to know the doctors that she's visiting.  There's no such thing as doctor bills.  It would be medical costs or something like that.  And second of all, there's never been anything that's happened on this show that's caused Sandy Cain to need a Band-Aid,  let alone a doctor.  I mean, medical professionals, that wouldn't be our fault because she's obviously a mentally ill person. 
[00:07:00]  And you know what, though?  I think she would get, like, just doctor bills because she's probably, like, she probably goes to, like, those first med places  where, like, she doesn't have a doctor.  She doesn't, you walk in, you pay, like, there's, like, a flat rate.  Right.  And so now she's just asking for a receipt.  Can I have a receipt?  Exactly.  So she can bring it up in a lawsuit.  But, I mean, nothing happens to her.  We actually, she brought this lawsuit up.  And, of course, I mean, we're going to take everything seriously here at Sirius XM. 
[00:07:30]  That's why they call us that.  And so we're going through Sandy Cain audio to find out if she has a case, if there's anything we should be worried about.  But, I mean, Danny, I didn't know it was Travis and me that were looking through all stuff that Sandy was complaining about  that on the tapes she's just going, this is great.  I love this.  Like, literally, she's talking about how much fun she's having doing what she's doing on the Opie and Anthony show,  whether it was, and in the video. 
[00:08:00]  We watched the video yesterday when Amy Schumer and Ari Shaffir were in here.  It's on YouTube of her getting, the video is called Ritualistically Abused.  But she wasn't actually getting abused.  That was just something cute we made up for YouTube.  But she's there.  She gets yogurt thrown at her.  She makes a little joke.  You know what I mean?  She gets gravy dumped on her.  At first she's upset.  Then she makes a little joke.  And she starts laughing and she goes, good radio, right?  I mean, this was the only place in the world that would promote her. 
[00:08:30]  And now, this is the last Sandy Cain bit, ladies and gentlemen.  Buckle in because this is it.  This is, I mean, this is going to be the biggest Sandy Cain bit because this is your one-stop shop  for Sandy Cain coverage, for the Cain case, for Sandy Gate.  Sandy Gate is today.  And we're going to get Opie and Anthony on the phone.  I'm going to try to get, if they're in town, see if they want to stop by before the court case.  I don't know any details about what time it is or what courtroom it's at. 
[00:09:00]  So I don't know if, you know, because people were Twittering me last night asking if we could have some kind of public gathering  to support Opie and Anthony.  I don't know anything about it.  I'm sure that would in no way be incredibly embarrassing for everyone involved.  Yeah, there'd be Kurt Love and two other guys just holding signs and Bobo saying,  did you get my tweets?  But, yeah, so I don't know where it is.  We're not doing any public gatherings.  But I do hope that Opie and Anthony make the most of this and do show up with judges' robes 
[00:09:30]  and powdered wigs on because we have to get some kind of publicity about this.  Like, Sandy Cain, she thinks, obviously she's doing this for the publicity.  But what she doesn't realize is this is like a big shot of publicity, which is negative  because we're just pointing out how absurd the whole thing is, and that will be it.  And then she will be silenced.  I mean, we may never play her bits again after this because it's just so, like, really?  Like, we're the only show left that would promote you. 
[00:10:00]  Like, I know, you know, years ago she was doing other shows, but we're the only show left that would put her on.  Yeah, but she still has her cable show, right?  I don't know if she has her cable show.  I've heard she does a local access cable show.  I've never seen the show.  Nobody's ever sent me tapes.  It's never come up online.  I don't – I'm not quite sure that it exists, but she always claims – and that's the other thing.  She's out in the middle of Times Square.  This is what she does, quote-unquote, for a living, is she steals the naked cowboy's routine.  If you're not familiar, she took the naked cowboy's gimmick of wearing a cowboy hat and underpants 
[00:10:30]  and did it in Times Square but claimed –  With a guitar.  And, by the way, she can't even – like, she's all upset about this guitar that's broken.  The record should clearly note that Sandy Cain does not know how to play the guitar.  No, she has no idea how to play the guitar.  She just kind of holds it and strums at it, but she's not really playing anything.  And in this lawsuit that she's filing, which is against the main complaint is that Opie broke her guitar, 
[00:11:00]  not only did Opie give her $400 for a guitar that on that video she claimed was worth $200,  she took the $400, she spent it on God knows what,  and she went out to Times Square with a bumper sticker over the hole in the guitar  and kept playing it for – I mean, at this point, that was 19 months ago,  and she's been playing it the whole time.  She stands out in the middle of Times Square here in New York City,  and she pretends to play guitar, and she tries to charge people a couple bucks to take pictures with her  when in actuality I've been out there. 
[00:11:30]  I've interviewed her out there in Times Square,  and what happens is maybe a couple people take a picture with her,  but people generally just point and laugh at her, take pictures of her from a distance,  and she yells at them to give her $2, which they never, ever do, which is great.  So she's basically Elmo.  Yeah.  She's just an old wrinkly Elmo.  Yeah.  A shaven Elmo.  Yeah.  Just abusing people in the middle of Times Square,  but that's the only vehicle she's going to have after this.  Like, at least she had some, like, you know, Opie and Anthony fame 
[00:12:00]  that, like, if an ONA fan were coming to Times Square,  they would pay to get a picture with Sandy Cain.  I know Struff, who's a big fan of the show,  has went and paid Sandy Cain for a picture because he wanted to put it on his Facebook.  Oh, Sam, I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to vote Sandy Cain.  Probably not the brightest person.  You don't think so?  Probably not the brightest person.  We'll go to, we're opening it.  80 years old on Section 8.  We'll go to Tony in Brooklyn again.  Probably didn't make the best decisions.  Jim Norton's going to be here in a little bit. 
[00:12:30]  We're going to be talking to Opie and Anthony today.  Levi Johnston is coming in later.  I love his pants.  No, not Levi Strauss.  Levi Johnston, who dated or who fathered a child with Sarah Palin's daughter,  is going to be in here.  And Brittany Andrews.  Creepie Johnston.  Yes, Creepie Johnston himself.  And Brittany Andrews, I guess from Penthouse, one of those nudie bags.  She's going to be in here, too, in a little while.  So stay tuned.  That's why we couldn't cancel the show.  It's a very packed show.  But Tony in Brooklyn, you're on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:13:00]  Say that again.  I want to give you a little legal advice.  Don't say that Opie broke the guitar.  Opie allegedly broke the guitar.  Yes.  If you look at the video, he is allegedly smashing the guitar on the floor.  Exactly.  Everything was alleged.  Yeah.  Well, what I like, and you're right, Tony.  Thank you for bringing that up.  And Tony's right.  This is all allegedly, folks. 
[00:13:30]  There's no evidence that, well, there's clear videotape.  I'm not sure, but it's still a legend.  What's great, though, is we're watching this video yesterday of Sandy Cain just getting horrible shit thrown on her.  Yogurt and gravy.  Interns picking the chair up and throwing it out of the studio.  And in the end of the video, and Johnny Fairplay from Survivor shitting literally in her hat, like taking her hat and making a number two in the hat.  And what it comes down to, at the end of it, is us saying, this proves our case. 
[00:14:00]  Because not only did Sandy Cain come back after that appearance, but after everything that had happened, she put the hat on for $100.  That's after being thrown out of the studio, after having everything thrown at her, her wig was torn off, shit was in her hat.  Jim said, Sandy, how much money would it cost for you to wear that hat that Johnny Fairplay just sit in, shit in?  And instead of Sandy saying, no, guys, you humiliated me. 
[00:14:30]  You've abused me.  You've done horrible things to me on a national platform.  She responded quick as a flash.  You've never heard anybody respond so quick.  $100.  $100.  Which Jim whipped out and said was the smartest money he'd ever spent.  Troy, this is a huge story.  I think we need some kind of Sandy Gate sweepers.  Okay.  You know what I mean?  I think we've got to really jazz this up.  Hey, man, come on, man.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  We need some kind of...  It's a fucking hat, man.  Yeah.  It's a kind of Sandy Gate sweepers.  I mean, maybe if you have any Sandy Cain drops to throw in there.  Because she was...  I mean, she's hilarious.  I loved when she was on because I thought the things that she said were so unusual.  I mean, Google image Sandy Cain at home so you can really see what she looks like.  If you're just waking up, I apologize that that's the image that you have to wake up to.  But just so you're all on the same page because people... 
[00:15:30]  And if you don't have internet access this morning, just put on an old episode of Tales from the Crypt.  Yes!  And picture that bald guy in a wig with pasties on.  And that's Sandy Cain.  She would regularly, when men would say, Sandy, I'm not attracted to you, claim that they must be homosexual.  You got a small dick.  Yeah.  That they had small penises and were obviously gay for not being attracted.  Danny, you spent a lot of time with Sandy.  As a matter of fact...  Now, she thinks that I don't like her. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  What she referred to you is that fucking intern, Danny Ross.  Well, see, I like...  I'm a fan of Sandy Cain.  I like all of her appearances when she comes in.  She's just...  I like her voice.  I like her cadences and her weirdnesses.  It's great.  I love it.  But when she comes in, I always just, like, I just give her the stink eye.  That's just been, like, the bit with me and her since I started her, you know?  So, every time, every single time she comes in, I just look at her like...  And just for that reason alone, she hates my guts. 
[00:16:30]  You're that fucking intern, Danny Ross.  Look, Club Soda Kenny, I mean, let me tell you something about Club Soda Kenny.  Like, he's a goof on the air, but when he has a job, nobody takes it as seriously as Club Soda Kenny.  And he...  I'm telling you, even though this is a goof court case, that there's no way that a judge should even hear it.  Like, this could be...  He could have been O.J.'s attorney he's working so hard.  He's going to...  There's no way O.B. and Anthony are going to have anything, any kind of penalty for this.  Is it safe to say that he lives for these moments?  Yeah, because he's just waiting. 
[00:17:00]  He's sitting in the cut, waiting for the be-a-hero moment.  And, I mean, he's there for it.  He's been collecting evidence since yesterday afternoon, sending out emails.  He's coming to that courthouse, Club Soda Kenny is, with audio, with video, with print.  I mean, there's going to be no stopping O.B. and Anthony with Club Soda Kenny on the case.  We should go to the phones.  Again, this is the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  Don't get confused.  We are live, covering Sandy Gate 2011, as Sandy Kane brings O.B. and Anthony to court.  O.N.A. will be here.  Norton will be here.  Well, I don't know if O.N.A. will be here, but we'll at least try to get him on the phone.  They have to go to court.  Norton will be here, and we'll have a couple guests.  Dom.  Hi, Sam.  Just curious.  I mean, I've watched a shitload of these little, you know, people's court and everything else.  How come O.N.A. aren't sitting there?  I mean, I know how much, you know, advertising costs on satellite.  How come they're not suing her or countersuing her for all the free advertising they've given her over the years? 
[00:18:00]  O.B. and Anthony are countersuing for plugging Sandy Kane's CD that nobody bought.  Yeah, I don't think O.B. and Anthony are even going to bother with it.  I mean, they'd probably...  What would you sue for, crabs?  Yeah, it's like, they'd probably have a better case than Sandy Kane does against them, countersuing her.  But I don't think they're going to bother countersuing Sandy Kane for advertising costs of her CD, I Love Dick. 
[00:18:30]  Which, I mean, if there's one person...  By the way, isolate that in there.  No, no.  Oh, man.  If there's one person that...  I'm not even going to say bought the CD, figured out how to get it.  Like, I don't even know where to get Sandy Kane's music, and she's on our show.  We were the ones promoting her.  Matt in D.C., you're on the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hey, before I talk about Sandy Rupert, I just want to say, Sam, your mom is sexy as hell, and I'd love to lick her tight little asshole one. 
[00:19:00]  That's very kind of you.  I don't think it's that tight, though.  I don't know.  Well, I'm going to say, now that Sandy's going to be off the show, I pray to God that this will return a stalker patty.  You're hoping that there's a lot more stalker patty bits.  I mean, look at the stalker patty.  You want to talk about...  Stalker patty is somebody who cares about the show.  I mean, she'll get naked and put a Krusty the Clown mask on.  And then pretend like she don't want to do it.  Yeah, but then she does it.  She lives for it.  I never understood that with her.  Why do you like stalker patty so much, Matt? 
[00:19:30]  I just remember listening years ago when they shaved her head.  They gave her a wig, and they pushed her out of the building and took the wig.  Ever since then, I was hooked on stalker patty and the...  Hey, linger longer, right?  What?  Linger longer, right?  Oh, for years and years.  Yeah, that's funny.  That's funny.  Thanks a lot, Matt.  And you're right.  I mean, as far as cadences go, stalker patty is the queen.  And Kobe in Indianapolis is feedbacking in.  Sam, don't forget, Sandy Cain used that guitar that she's suing over being smashed on America's Got Talent. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, that is the same one.  She went on the biggest TV show on network TV of the summer and auditioned for her big break with this guitar that apparently doesn't work.  I mean...  Why do you need to have a new guitar if you don't play guitar?  Like, your whole bit...  It's a prop, anyway.  I know.  It's just a prop.  She doesn't play guitar.  And the guitar was not...  Opie gave her double what the guitar was worth already.  And she doesn't play it.  And she doesn't need it. 
[00:20:30]  River Rat Doc is feedbacking in.  If you wear a hat with shit, you must acquit.  And I think that's something Kenny needs to write down.  Because there's no doubt in my mind that that's going to be big.  Everybody was tweeting me last night asking for clips of some of the famous Sandy Cain moments.  Eric, do we have the guitar cutting string?  The guitar cutting string.  The guitar string?  Yeah.  The guitar string cutting?  I have just a short clip. 
[00:21:00]  It's 53 seconds.  Okay, good.  Because this is one of the things that bothered Sandy Cain so much.  Again, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  People need to understand, this is a huge show.  This is why we're taking this show live.  We were going to throw it to Worst Of, except we wanted to make sure that nobody thought that we're just going to do Worst Of all day.  Because we're going to do our best, anyway, to talk to Opie and Anthony.  Norton's going to be here in a little while.  Bristol Palin's ex, Levi Johnson, is going to be in here.  Some porno chick is going to be in here. 
[00:21:30]  Brittany Andrews.  So, make sure you stay tuned.  But I did want to play a quick clip.  Club Soda Kenny.  I've been telling the people how diligently that you've been working and rising to the occasion.  Sam, do you consider yourself a talented person?  I do.  Well, talk about something else other than Sandy Cain.  This is the story.  No, it is the story tomorrow.  Well, what's the story today?  I mean, why are we...  You decide.  I think I'm here to make sure that people know about Sandy Cain. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, tomorrow.  Not today.  No.  So, what about the clip?  I was just about to talk.  What do you say?  May your brightest tomorrows be your worst yesterdays?  What do you say?  Something like that.  Yeah, it's about right.  What do you say?  I'm not going to say it because I think you got it right.  Oh, all right.  But how confident are you?  Are you nervous?  Is that why you want us to move along?  No, I don't like to lose.  I don't think you...  I've never seen you lose.  Yeah.  All right.  So, why talk about it and give her her defense, her prosecution evidence? 
[00:22:30]  But we're not giving her prosecution evidence, are we?  Talk about something.  Look what's in the paper.  Look at the headlines.  Love ever blasting in pictures of guns.  I put 11 bullets in NYPD.  Hey, Kenny.  Yes, sir.  What do you think about that new Facebook?  Oh, shit.  I saw on your Facebook status that you were unhappy. 
[00:23:00]  Then Facebook changed.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Are you just not good with change or do you think that they've made some mistakes on Facebook  as we cover Sandy Gate?  We'll cover Sandy Gate tomorrow when the real talent is here.  But Opie and Anthony are going to be contributing to the show today.  Maybe.  All right.  Well, I mean, what are we going to play?  War stuff so everybody tunes out?  No, just do what you do. 
[00:23:30]  That's what I'm doing.  Yeah, but you're not doing it properly.  So, talk to me about this Facebook problem you have.  It sucks.  Why?  Because it sucks shit.  But what's the problem with it specifically that you don't like?  They shouldn't have changed that format.  That fucking stupid ticker thing on the right side that you've got to scroll down.  It's not easy to do.  It's amazing that you're such a Facebook guy.  Because for the longest time, you said you were not going to ever sign up for Facebook. 
[00:24:00]  Well, I'm not looking to hook up.  Let's be clear about that.  A lot of women have gotten the wrong idea.  Yeah, yeah.  People are always asking me if Kenny is DTF, and I've got to be like, no.  Yeah.  Why is Kenny on Facebook?  Is he down to fuck?  Yeah.  No, no.  I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to, like, social network.  I don't know why, but.  Jim Norton is here.  Jim, we were just going over the changes to Facebook, because Club Study County didn't  like us talking about Sandy Kane. 
[00:24:30]  So, we wanted to talk about the new Facebook.  I heard there was a change, the page switched or something, but I don't know what happened.  Yeah, it stinks, Jim.  What's the new page?  It's a whole different format.  Like, they have, like, a ticker scroll.  Like, look at Danny's thing there.  It's hard.  Oh, I did actually see.  I fucking hate it.  Top stories.  Yeah, Facebook is annoying me, because I don't like that top right thing with all what my friends  are doing.  Yeah.  Can you take that off?  Yeah.  No.  What's the point of it?  Isn't it the same thing that's in the middle? 
[00:25:00]  No, but it's, like, different.  And you can't delete, on Facebook, what's annoying now is you can't delete, like, conversations  you have.  They all save in your email, which is fine.  I mean, it's not like I'm giving out nuclear secrets, but it's a more fucking mail.  When I posted yesterday that I wasn't happy about the Facebook thing, like, there was,  like, a lot of, like, commentary.  Was everybody liking your status?  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody was in agreement with me.  But then one person says, hey, Kenny, don't worry about Facebook.  Worry about the court case. 
[00:25:30]  And let me tell you something, people.  Well, I can multitask.  That is one thing about Kenny.  He is good at multitasking.  Yeah.  People can poke you, like, or ask for a pillow fight or a coffee.  You know, I can get you a little gift.  Listen, listen.  Jim is here now.  Jim has his own agenda.  No, not really.  Yeah, I mean.  That's all 9.30.  I'm fine.  Yeah, he's just kind of here for Levi Johnston.  We'll talk about Sandy tomorrow.  Do we have coffee?  Yes, we will get coffee and breakfast.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Oh, you rule.  All right.  So, thank God you're here, Jim, because Sam was getting off on the wrong foot. 
[00:26:00]  So, what do you think, what's happening so far with the case?  Well, Kenny wants us to talk about anything but the case on the day that everybody was wondering about the case.  Well, yeah, the case is kind of what people are wondering about.  Plus, we don't have any new information to report.  Right.  It's like we can report anything.  Right.  I mean, Kenny's been, I was saying, Kenny's acting attorney just about because he's going crazy finding all this evidence.  He's not going to, he's going to make sure that ONA walk out of there unscathed because Kenny's walking into that courtroom with piles of audio, video, text. 
[00:26:30]  I mean, I've never seen somebody prefer.  None of it pertains to the case.  No, it's not just.  It's part of all homeless Charlie stuff.  I got confused.  I thought it was about that guy.  See, this is what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  So, now the other side knows what we got.  I mean, of course we have evidence.  Yeah.  Yeah, but why tip our, why show our hands?  It's a court case against Sandy Kane. 
[00:27:00]  Exactly.  You're not exactly meeting big opposition.  Yeah.  I mean.  Is this DNA evidence?  Someone's shitting her hat.  The prelude to your evidence.  I take it very seriously.  The prelude to me talking about your evidence was that this case is so ridiculous that a judge probably won't even bother listening to the evidence before he throws it out.  I don't, I don't even want to, want to.  It's a small claims court.  There's got to be a judge, right? 
[00:27:30]  You don't talk to the lady outside first.  No, there's, there's a choice of mediation.  Which means what?  What does mediation mean?  That like, yeah, you know, you discuss like, this is what I say.  This is what we say.  And then that guy decides in the middle.  Oh, kind of like the arbitration.  Yeah.  Okay.  But there's no way that O&I are going to give in at all.  Why would they?  I mean, there's, they're not going to make any deal where they're like, we'll give you a little bit.  Because they're going to give her nothing because that's what she'll get.  Why don't you take some phone calls? 
[00:28:00]  Because everybody wants to talk about Sandy Kane.  She doesn't deserve any money.  I don't think that they did anything wrong.  Yeah.  Honestly.  I mean, and that's what we were talking about.  How it's like every time she's come in here and something's happened to her, she's come back from work.  You don't even know what her allegations are.  So you don't even know what you're talking about.  They read the summons on the air.  Yeah.  So I, yes, I do know what her allegations are.  What are they?  Well, I'm not going, well, we don't want to go over her allegations, right?  All of a sudden.  And tip off the other side.  Yeah, us is the other side.  Her allegations are that the guitar was broken or whatever. 
[00:28:30]  And it was just silly.  And there was Dr. Bills and their hat was stolen.  And bullet holes were open in it.  Which is, I mean, even you have to admit, Kenny, we did fire bullets into her hat.  It's been documented.  Yeah, I mean.  It's not a secret.  There's twit picks.  Yeah, there was nobody in a grassy knoll.  This was.  Yeah.  Anthony said, I'm going to take this hat to the firing range and do this.  Then he came back the next day and said, I went to the firing range. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, man.  And my fucking hat had bullets in it, man, your honor.  I would make sure that she's not accusing that fucking intern Danny Ross of anything.  Because we know that she doesn't like him.  Yeah, well, I don't know if that was brought up or whatnot.  I don't think it was.  I don't know.  I don't know what there is to talk about there.  But I would love to know if I could talk about that.  See, I'm only bringing up stuff that's already been on the air.  Yeah.  Like.  See you.  Well, yeah, I know it's up to me. 
[00:29:30]  But I don't understand why you're worried about it at all.  You have nothing to worry about.  You're fully prepared for a case.  I got nothing to worry about because my name's not.  I'm not.  I'm not a defendant in this one.  Well, I don't think team Opie and Anthony has anything to worry about.  Yeah, I think they're in the right.  Yeah.  And I think that, you know, once you get to the courthouse, whether it's the arbiter or  the judge or whoever is talking to you guys, we'll see that Sandy Kane is a lunatic. 
[00:30:00]  Do you want him to have a trial by jury?  I mean, I think it would be great.  The more press we can get out of this, the better, because, I mean, whoever suggested  that they show up in judges' robes and powdered wigs yesterday was right on the money because  we should be turning this into the biggest court case New York has ever seen.  Wrong.  They're not going to be shock jocks in the courtroom.  Why not?  They're ordinary citizens.  But this is not an ordinary case.  Right.  It's the naked cowgirl who wears pasties in Times Square and who's 79 years old. 
[00:30:30]  Most ordinary citizens aren't suing radio people for defecating in our hats and shooting  it.  Yeah.  That's not a normal court case.  Johnny Fairplay shit in my hat.  He said to me, I shit in his hat.  He repeated, I shit in his hat.  Yeah.  It's my cousin Kenny.  Rick in Ohio, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Rick.  Well, I just wanted to make a point that at small claims court, there's no lawyers.  Right.  There are no lawyers. 
[00:31:00]  But there is Club Soda Kenny.  He's an acting attorney.  There is a cadaver.  There's two with Sandy there.  Hey, yeah.  Thanks.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Thanks, Rick.  Okay.  But yeah, Jim, before you got here, we were just talking about the case and everything.  And after like, I don't know, 25 minutes or something, Kenny came in like, move on.  Next topic.  And we were like, why?  Yeah, there's nothing that's really secret with this one.  Everybody kind of knows what happened.  You know, she decided to sue.  I think it was a bad move on her part.  Yeah.  It's like, because you keep coming back. 
[00:31:30]  You shouldn't have kept coming back to the show when you know what the nature of the show is.  And that's what I said, too.  Like, when we were watching the video yesterday with Ari and Amy in here, when you offered her,  when we did all these things to her that she might have a complaint against, and then  you could see in the video, she walked right back in the studio, and you said, how much  to put your hat on with the shit in it?  And instead of saying, you guys have humiliated me, you've gone way too far, blah, blah, blah.  Within a second, she said, 100 bucks.  100 bucks.  I don't remember that, but I'm sure I asked it as a joke, like, not thinking she would 
[00:32:00]  ever do it.  You never think someone's going to put a hat with shit on it on.  And she gave you an amount of money that was so easy to come by.  Yeah.  Okay, I actually have 100 bucks.  I might even have to ask the room for money.  Yeah, it would have been, she said 5,000, man.  And then you'd be like, ah, that would have been funny if you could do it.  But 100 bucks, yeah.  You can realize that this show has had two instances of someone putting a shit hat on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both are winners, and both are filmed.  I wonder if Sandy can't wear her wig to court. 
[00:32:30]  It'll be weird to see her without her wig on if she's not wearing it, because she just had  the dried-out brown hair otherwise.  It's just a nightmare.  Uh-oh, Kenny's coming back up the hallway.  He might not want us talking about this.  Okay, I'll put this here for...  Oh, yeah.  Enough of me for Kenny.  There's something on the fucking...  There's a peanut butter on the side of the mic.  Ew.  Who's using it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Sean, you're on O.B. and Anthony.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[00:33:00]  Hello, Sean.  Hey, I just wanted to give some props to Kenny.  I think that's just awesome evidence that he's got her playing the guitar in question  on America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  That's going to be blindsided, man.  They're never going to see this one coming.  That's just...  That's awesome.  That's a great job, Kenny.  Yeah.  This is not the fucking Kennedy assassination.  They're not being sued by a high-profile attorney.  It's Sandy Kane.  Everybody knows what happened.  Yeah.  She's pissed off, and she's just looking for attention. 
[00:33:30]  And she took the guitar that O.B. broke that she's suing over, allegedly, and went to  America's Got Talent and auditioned for America's Got Talent with that same guitar.  And there's no allegedly.  He broke it.  Yeah.  And he's okay with breaking it.  He said he broke it.  Somebody called up and said, you should say allegedly.  No, we watched video yesterday.  He smashed it under the ground.  Yeah.  You don't need to say allegedly with him actually breaking the guitar in video.  He broke it.  Yeah.  And he paid her for it.  Well, listen, we should take a break so you can settle in.  You just got here, Jim.  I'm fine. 
[00:34:00]  But O.B. has said he was going to try to come by today before the court case.  He said that, but if they get sleep late, they're going to sleep late.  I don't know if he actually will.  The only reason I came in today was because we had Brittany Andrews and Levi Johnston, and  they couldn't be rescheduled.  Yeah.  If they could have come in tomorrow, I wouldn't have come in today either.  Levi Johnston is going to be good.  I hope so.  I mean, his book is out, and I've read like 200 pages of it, and like the last 60 or 80  pages, I just kind of skimmed and took pieces out of it for notes.  It's great that you could just write a book about your girlfriend's mom that you didn't 
[00:34:30]  like.  It's like you have that kind of clout.  Everybody would love to do that.  Yeah, but the catch-22 is your girlfriend's mom can really crush you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's never going to come out looking like a good guy.  No.  And I didn't like him until I read this, and it's like, you know what?  I'm sure that some of this, there's two sides to every story.  Uh-huh.  But she seems really unpleasant.  Like, if she didn't like certain things he said in the media before, she is going to  hate this book.  Well, I can't wait until he's in.  We will take a break, but we will be back with more of the Opie and Anthony show without 
[00:35:00]  Opie and Anthony, but Jim Norton's here.  The rest of us are here.  It's going to be a great run.  What's the name of this show be today?  Norton and Friends is a good one, but what should we call it today?  Well, Coke Logic suggested instead of Opie and Anthony Live.  Instead of Opie and Anthony?  How about Sam Norton?  That's really good.  Sam Norton.  Sam Norton.  That's good.  Sam Norton.  Yes.  Sam Norton. 
[00:35:30]  The show will be back.  Stay tuned.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Listen to this one.  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera.  He goes, Brewer, your dad has to go.  He has to go now.  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in a toilet or it's over. 
[00:36:00]  So, I go there.  I open the door.  And when I open the door, there's shit on my fingers.  So, I'm like, what is this?  So, I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  And it's fresh.  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So, I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So, I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it.  So, I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking around.  And I look at him.  He's got shorts on. 
[00:36:30]  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts.  I finally get up upstairs.  And I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs, where I took him out of the car,  there's a pile that must have fell out of his shorts.  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  It's just, there's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people are just staring at me going,  I can't believe someone let their dog just defecate on the sidewalk. 
[00:37:00]  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Mitchell Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  On today's show, Tyra Banks.  Um, I like trannies.  Oh, my God.  I like trannies, too.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy. 
[00:37:30]  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony show.  How great is that?  Celebrity friends.  My favorite new bit.  Here on the, uh,  Tree Rock Jimsome show.  What's it, uh...  It's, uh...  Jim Norton and myself.  Because Opie and Anthony have their, uh, Sandy Kane court case to deal with today. 
[00:38:00]  They're gallivanting in court.  Yes.  They're gallivanting.  I feel like the Opie and Anthony show is becoming a brand.  It doesn't refer to two people anymore.  No.  Although somebody...  Yeah, that's what it was.  Chris in New Jersey suggested the title The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam, which I think  at least it'll get people up, you know?  Yeah, it really does.  It kind of...  Because it's got both names included in it.  Yeah.  Um, and it just...  It really says something.  Like, times are about to get wild.  Plus, it's like, you know, for the commercials.  What, do you wake up groggy?  Need something to go with your toast in the morning? 
[00:38:30]  How about some morning jam with Jim and Sam?  That's good.  How about jam with Chip, Jim, and Sam?  Something.  Do you know how tempting it is, by the way, to do chip until 10 o'clock?  I know.  It's really hard not to do.  I was going to say, people really enjoyed when Chip showed up on the after show and was  answering calls.  We should try to see how long we can do Chip until people don't enjoy him anymore.  There are people that wouldn't...  Because the goal of Chip is...  I do like when people...  As a community, I like people laughing and think it's funny.  But there is a part of being like, Bob Kelly really hates him. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And that makes me happy.  Like, Chip should be able to be used to really bother somebody.  A lot of women, I find, hate Chip.  Sure.  Like...  Because he reminds them probably of the dummies that they're fucking.  He probably reminds them of the dumb guy who they're with who tries to be funny in  front of people and who's never funny.  But like, Jess, my fiancé, doesn't like Chip.  Oh, good.  Uh, Jonathan, your manager's wife, hates fucking Chip.  Like, like, Jonathan told me, oh, I thought of you the whole time I was out there because 
[00:39:30]  he gave me like 50 new stories of annoying his wife with white.  So great.  Like, he'll talk to her parents or her friends and they'll say something like, yeah, we got  to go to bed, bath, and out.  And Jonathan will just start going, sis, sis.  And he won't even do Chip, right?  He'll just go like, sis, bed, bath, and beyond.  Sis, sis.  And that's all he does and his wife's like, just fucking stop it.  Not only does he do the impression completely off, but he doesn't include a Chip joke.  No, he doesn't at all.  And he hates Chip.  Like, I derailed him 40 times when we were out just throwing Chip in. 
[00:40:00]  Like, he least expected.  I love to throw Chip in.  And he just, he has to acknowledge him.  Like, uh, he'll go like, ah, that's good, Chip.  That's good.  It just stops everything and it really annoys him.  But he can't be mean to Chip because, like, Chip is one of his clients.  It's like, Chip's on, you can't win with Chip ever.  No.  You can't ever win.  Well, that's what I was talking to Jess about last night.  Like, that's what the beauty of people calling in.  That people call in and they try to go with whatever Chip's vibe is. 
[00:40:30]  Like, if Chip is attacking something, they'll call in and try to attack it with Chip.  But Chip will tell him that's stupid because he doesn't like other people having attention.  It's not a team effort.  Ever.  With Lyle Chipperson.  You're never going to get on the same team as Chip.  Lyle wants it all to himself.  Yeah, he wants it to himself, but he doesn't understand what a subtle cunt he is and how  he sabotages everything.  Yeah.  He just does.  Um, I don't know what Coke...  Coke Logic.  Hey, uh, scissors up, Sam and Dave. 
[00:41:00]  That's Jim, not Dave.  Yes.  Be respectful.  And it's Jim and Sam.  Sam and Jim is fine.  Hi, uh, Sim.  Sim.  Hi, uh, Coke Logic.  Hi.  Hey, uh, I just had a question for, uh, Jim.  And, uh, sorry, I'm fucking tired of shit.  I'm sure you're drunk again.  It's all right.  I'm not drunk.  Shut up.  But is there...  You break in the chip and it's like, um...  Uh...  You do it in front of people you don't know or comedians or famous people and stuff. 
[00:41:30]  Is there ever been a time that people go, what the fuck are you doing?  That's a good...  Yeah, I've had a couple of, uh, a time, but not really.  Normally, it's very rare that, like, when we eat a lot of times, we'll go, like, she.  Like, when Sam and I were in, uh, Comic-Con, literally every meal we had, I would say, well, she will have this and I'm having that or her.  And nobody ever calls you out on it.  But once in a while, someone would go, like, she.  And then that was it.  But it's never happened in front of me. 
[00:42:00]  And you did it to literally everybody you could.  Like, the car guy who picked us up was like, uh, do you need a water?  And Jim would say, well, I'm fine, but I don't know about her.  And he would just do it to everyone.  And nobody, everybody goes, oh, okay.  Nobody calls you out on a chip.  I've been called out on a couple of times, but it's extremely rare.  Um, and somebody would go, like, what are you, what?  What are you talking about?  Because they think that you're kind of a retard or there's something wrong with you.  But Chip is not a retard.  He's just very aggressive and angry.  But he's not retarded.  He's just got personality flaws.  Yeah, he's just an aggressive personality flawed person. 
[00:42:30]  You're right.  I said personality twice.  Although, what is, doesn't he have, uh, uh, Asperger's or something?  Yeah.  Oh, and he has a bit of autism.  Yeah.  Like, uh, we, we learned that the other day.  The chip just hits the bell and he likes the sound of the dinging.  Yeah.  A bit of Asperger's.  How do you feel about other people doing the chip impression?  I love it.  Anthony hates it.  Like, whenever Chip shows up on Twitter, fucking Ant hates.  Uh-huh.  I go fucking nuts when I see sis, sis.  I literally, chip tweets make me laugh out loud.  Because they can't lose.  If they're terrible, they're perfect for Chip. 
[00:43:00]  If they're funny, they're perfect for Chip.  That really is the easiest way.  Oh.  Speaking of Anthony's tweets, I did want to bring up that he got into one of his, uh, awesome  to watch Twitter arguments with the entire Twitter community yesterday over this, uh,  was the Troy Davis situation.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I read a little bit about it and, uh, it kind of reminds me, I guess, of the, uh,  the Mumia Abu-Jamal case in, uh, Philadelphia where a cop was killed.  Black guys, you know, accuse or go to death row for it. 
[00:43:30]  And people, it becomes the cause celeb.  Yeah.  To get him off.  And then you read certain aspects of it.  It's like, well, there was some doubt about it.  Something the prosecutor said, though, kind of, uh, I don't know if we have it in this  article, but one of the, the prosecutor who is retired said, yes, this case was a travesty  or something to, I'm paraphrasing.  It's a travesty, but only because it took so long.  Um, there's the presumption of innocence or something, but they took what could be, what 
[00:44:00]  appears to be a shadow of a doubt, um, and made it look like it was a shadow of a doubt.  Like it was, it was an impression of a shadow of a doubt.  Basically.  She was saying, she was saying that he was absolutely guilty.  Yeah.  I mean, I was reading, uh, articles because I didn't know much about it until yesterday  to tell you the truth.  And, uh, I didn't see anything that was super compelling that he was innocent.  Like, I guess there was doubt as to whether or not he was guilty.  I think the lack of, of evidence.  Was it? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Like, was there not a lot of, it would, well, I mean, was the court case rushed along?  No, it wasn't, it wasn't rushed along, but he was, he was convicted mainly based on,  on the testimony of nine witnesses.  All eyewitnesses, yeah.  And I mean, they never found the gun.  They never, you know, uh, but there were shell casings that apparently matched, you know,  uh, a gun that he was previously convicted for in a shooting.  So.  Well, did they arrest him on the spot or did he run?  No, he, uh, he ran and he was, uh, he turned himself in after, uh, after the man who he 
[00:45:00]  says shot the cop went to the cops and said, no, Troy Davis did it.  But who said it first?  Uh, the other guy.  I don't, I don't remember.  So the other guy might've been out with Troy Davis.  Yeah.  They were together.  Troy, okay.  So Troy Davis might have shot this guy and the other guy, and then the other guy went  to the jail.  I'm not going to fucking murder.  Yeah.  Cause he realized, holy shit, what just happened?  This guy just killed somebody. 
[00:45:30]  And then, uh, but I guess the thing.  But over the years, like seven of the nine witnesses recanted their testimony.  Yeah, my witness testimony is rough.  And then said that they were, you know, they were coerced and.  I mean, they probably, you do try to get confessions that you want out of eyewitnesses,  I guess, from time to time, but.  It's a tough case.  So the question is, the question is whether it was him or the guy he was with.  Cause it had to be one of those.  And then other people say that, you know, like this other guy has like confessed to doing  it, like when he was drunk and you know, it's a tough case. 
[00:46:00]  I mean, this guy, he wasn't a good guy, you know, like he'd been convicted on other  stuff before.  It's rough with the death penalty.  Cause it'd be one thing if like, okay, we'll leave him in jail for a while and just try  eventually something will happen.  But when you got to kill a guy, you got to really make sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cause they, they say it's like we are the argument as well, if you know, a hundred  percent that he did it, it's okay to kill him.  But the court system has it built in where they feel they know something a hundred percent,  but then they can refuse new evidence.  Like the Supreme court did a weird thing with this one where they actually gave him a chance 
[00:46:30]  to prove his innocence, which normally you don't have to prove your innocence.  They have to prove.  And it was a higher, uh, I guess preponderance of evidence than, uh, it's tough to prove your  innocence.  It's a, it's a lot tougher to prove your innocence than to prove somebody's guilt.  Well, they wanted more evidence to prove he was innocent, but the Supreme court normally  doesn't do that.  Yeah.  I think he couldn't, um, or he would, he just, they didn't feel it was strong enough.  So they sided with the prosecution.  But this wasn't like, like the West Memphis three thing, like everybody said they didn't  do it.  This wasn't that cut and dry. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  It was, or was it?  No, no, no.  It was not cut and dry.  But it makes me hard.  It's hard for me to be on the side of the death penalty.  I mean, of course a cop killer, I think deserves to be put to death.  Yeah.  But I just, I don't trust that we're a hundred percent right.  Well, yeah, cause so many mistakes have been made.  There's so many times that it's been proven that, that, oh, this guy really didn't do  it.  Oh, he's been in jail for 25 years and now he's being released.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the fucking fact that prosecute, you know, fuck prosecutors on some cases, like when  you look at that guy, Nifong or whatever his name was in the, uh, the, uh, the three 
[00:47:30]  Duke guys who was the prosecutor who was fucking being a total twat and was disbarred for his  behavior.  They're dirty too.  Sometimes they don't want to admit they made a mistake.  They don't want to admit they prosecuted the wrong guy.  Well, that's, that, that's why the West Memphis three had to, had to put in an Alfred plea  because the prosecution doesn't want to admit that they were wrong.  The fucking prosecution, why wouldn't you order DNA evidence?  If you put a guy in jail, you shouldn't have.  Yeah.  Fucking terrible.  Like be a person, be a human being.  Like you have to admit, yeah, I made a mistake here. 
[00:48:00]  Like it wasn't just one person who did it.  It was a whole, obviously everybody was, has to come together to put somebody in jail.  One person can't put a guy in jail.  So, so it's not like one person has to stand up and say, sorry, I blew it.  It's like, we all come together and say, yeah, look, we might've rushed to this.  The fact that they, they don't, the prosecutors or whatever should be the ones looking for,  uh, DNA evidence.  Thank you, Kenny.  And trying to get guys free to, they put them in jail.  They don't care.  They, they got the win.  Yeah.  That's what it is.  It's like, they want to make sure that they have a good record, that they have enough 
[00:48:30]  wins.  And so it's like, whatever, whatever person you put in front of them, their job is to  put them in jail, not to figure out whether they're, their job is to get the death penalty.  Wow.  Welcome to the liberals radio hour.  We really sound like flamers.  Yeah.  Ant's probably going crazy somewhere.  Like, that was a piece of shit.  Fuck him.  Well, that's what he was doing on Twitter last night.  Well, no one's, I mean, we're all sitting here, but no one's complaining about the white  supremacist who was killed yesterday.  I think you know he was guilty. 
[00:49:00]  Exactly.  I mean, you know, I'm not against the death penalty when.  No.  When it's been proven that you dragged a black man for miles.  That's what I love about Ant, though.  Like, we're all sitting here saying, well, you know, I guess it could have been, it could.  Ant was never so sure of anyone's guilt in his life yesterday.  He knew that that man killed that cop and needed to die today.  Yeah, I'm up in the air.  I just think that poor people, I don't even think it's racial.  I think it's just poor people have a much higher shot at getting it because they can't  afford the defenses.  Yeah.  And I just, I don't, I don't trust it. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, but is this other guy?  Is this other guy saying anything that was with him?  Or what happened to the other guys?  Is he in jail?  I imagine now he's not going to confess.  Yeah, I know.  I imagine he's going to keep it under his hat if he did do it.  Just kill them both.  I mean, that way.  I don't like fucking eyewitness stuff only being enough to get a guy put to death, though.  Yeah.  Because eyewitnesses are fucking idiots.  And they never found the gun?  No.  Hmm.  Then again, nine people saying they saw you do something.  That's a lot of eyewitnesses.  Yeah, were they changing their opinions because they started to feel guilty? 
[00:50:00]  Like, oh no, the weight of what I said is having this guy killed?  That probably has a lot to do with it.  Like, people going back and say, well, it could have been someone else.  I mean, was I coerced?  When, in actuality, the cops are probably more forcing them to remember.  Like, no, think about it.  Think, was it, was it, and finally they'll say yes.  And then, yeah, maybe they do feel guilty.  Yeah, it's a tough one because I don't think anybody's disputing the fact that he was there.  And that he was part of this gang that was, you know, like, ooh, well, you know.  Dave Ruffians. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  The lords.  So, like I said before, he's not a guy that we're fighting for his freedom.  No, I don't think anybody's fighting for his freedom.  People are fighting for, you know, a new trial.  Yeah.  Although, I mean, I don't know if you want a new trial and give them the opportunity to figure out  a mistrial and a way to get out of jail because he shouldn't be out of jail by any stretch  of the imagination.  Well, they could have committed a sentence.  But he was there.  He was an accessory, at least.  He had a lot of high-profile people supporting him, though.  Doesn't mean anything.  Who did he have?  He had Jimmy Carter. 
[00:51:00]  Puff Daddy.  Puff Daddy.  Oh, fuck.  Well, if Daddy was supporting him, then obviously.  Pope Benedict XVI.  They're always against that penalty.  The Pope's always against it.  Yeah, they will.  Anytime there's a tiny bit of doubt, like we could say that this is a bad thing, they'll support  anyone.  And even if they think you're guilty, they would still say that they shouldn't put you  to death.  Big Boy?  Big Boy from OutKast.  Look, I think that maybe while Jim said his opinion wasn't racially motivated, Diddy and 
[00:51:30]  Big Boy might have been somewhat racially motivated in this cause.  Did they say that or no?  They didn't say that.  This is just my opinion.  Yeah, you're probably right.  But Big Boy from OutKast hasn't been known to be the most politically outspoken person in  the past.  They see a black guy being put to death and they want to stand up.  Yeah, and there's an ounce of doubt.  They're going to be the guys to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you know.  It doesn't mean anything.  Who cares?  That sounds kind of shitty, but he wasn't a good guy.  Yeah, I mean, like we said, he was at least an accessory to murder, if not a murderer. 
[00:52:00]  He didn't, like, wasn't he fucking pistol whipping a guy for a beer?  Some homeless guy for a beer?  That's how it started.  So he did, but he definitely did that.  Well, the story goes that the man was pistol whipping this homeless man because they got  into a fight about a beer.  This off-duty police officer who was working as a security guard at a Burger King, so you  know you're in a good neighborhood.  Yeah.  When you need a security guard at a Burger King.  Yeah.  No, it's never the sign of a good neighborhood.  Oh.  Literal Jim.  Okay, good.  So the off-duty police officer comes over to try and break up the fight, and Troy Davis 
[00:52:30]  allegedly...  But Troy Davis definitely was the guy pistol whipping the homeless guy.  That's what they say, but...  Okay, so that's whoever was pistol whipping the homeless guy shot the cop.  Right, and then there's no fucking gun.  What happened to the gun?  What were you pistol whipping with?  You fucking never found the gun?  The hard part of your thumb?  This is like Clue.  Yeah, it's really exciting.  The intrigue is Colonel Troy with the gun in the Pistain Alley.  Yeah, Brian wants to say something.  I don't know where he's from. 
[00:53:00]  Brian, you're on the Opie and Anthony show, as it were.  Yes.  Hey, you guys got to answer facts straight.  There were 23 state witnesses that presented evidence that they saw him shoot the guy.  The seven people that recanted of the nine were all friends of Troy Davis.  You guys got your fucking facts from Amnesty International.  No, we didn't.  No, I got my facts from Yahoo News.  I got my facts from...  I'm not getting shit from Amnesty International.  I got my facts from Lib Travis over here.  But we're actually...  We're actually saying... 
[00:53:30]  We're Air Force...  We're saying that we don't know.  Yeah.  ...who can you wait for them?  There were...  There were...  Well...  Why...  How come every article says there were nine witnesses?  Yeah, I've heard nine.  I don't understand.  Where's 23?  ...with the media.  This guy was...  Jimmy's point...  No, it's the media's agenda.  All right, but dude, hold on.  You're saying 23 witnesses.  Maybe you're right, but don't act like we don't have our facts when everywhere is saying  nine.  Where is saying 23?  23, if you're right, I'll say you're right.  I just don't know where it is.  Yeah.  Pull up Ann Coulter's article last night, who is a lawyer... 
[00:54:00]  All right, look, Brian, I mean, if you're going to say that Travis is biased for looking  at Amnesty International, don't you think Ann Coulter might have a slight bias on it?  Yeah, she's a little right.  Now we're looking at two ends of the spectrum here, Brian.  You're arguing a point, but she's a fucking lawyer that can review cases, and she did.  She went through all 187 pages of it.  She has a slight agenda.  Yeah.  She probably did, though, and she is a lawyer.  Yeah, I mean, she's not a dumb woman.  There were 23 witnesses that presented it.  Seven of those people were his friends that recanted post-case. 
[00:54:30]  Okay.  All right.  You can't argue that fact.  There were a total of 23 witnesses to one or both of the shootings.  What do you mean to one or both of his shootings?  Oh, wait, wait.  The one that he was previously convicted of.  Okay, the one he was previously convicted of.  So on this case.  So you get your facts straight.  There was only nine on this case.  So, and yeah, and the other ones are not up to, so there's, what, 14 for the other case.  Probably 14 for the other one.  So obviously he was a piece of shit.  Yeah, I mean, that's not up for debate whether or not he was a shitty guy and whether or not 
[00:55:00]  he should not be in society.  So, Brian, what's your comment on that?  He hung up.  Why would he hang up?  I don't know.  I guess he thought we were done.  Brian, we'll call back because Travis just raised a point that you didn't have your facts.  There's nothing worse than somebody going, get your facts straight when they don't have  their facts right.  Get your facts straight and hang up before they realize.  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Joe in Buffalo, you're on O&A.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Joseph.  Hey, listen.  The, uh, ah, stick it window. 
[00:55:30]  The, uh, there was physical evidence.  The bullet that they pulled out of the cop matched the bullet that Troy Davis had used  in a gun in a previous crime that he was convicted of.  So they know it was his gun that shot the cop.  And the witnesses that changed their testimony, they didn't say that he didn't shoot the cop.  They just softened their testimony.  Well, we're not sure.  Yeah, that's what, there may be a lot of that guilt you were talking about.  What, what happened to the, how, why was he on the street if he was convicted of another  fucking murder? 
[00:56:00]  I don't, I don't think it was necessarily a murder.  It was just a shooting.  Oh, oh.  It was a robbery.  Oh, okay.  See, that's what, that, that, that's what I keep saying.  It's, it's tough because this guy obviously wasn't a good guy.  Yeah, it's a fucking, you know?  Yeah, it seems like.  Just because you didn't find the gun, you know, you still, the, the casings matched.  Yeah.  You know, yeah, so if he didn't do it, his friend took his gun and did it, he probably  shot the cop.  Don't you wish it was Troy Kwan we were talking about him?  It's a Kwan-spiracy, spiracy, spiracy. 
[00:56:30]  I just have questions about this shooting.  That's all I'm saying.  Just ask questions.  The callers call up and instead of, like, we're saying, yeah, maybe you're right.  Look, I don't have the answers.  Just the questions.  You know, I just don't have time to investigate.  I don't, I would love to see, although we would ask Troy for his opinion.  I haven't done the research.  I haven't, I don't know.  I'm just saying that we might not know what happened.  We probably don't know what happened that night.  You know where the murder weapon is?  Where?  Harp.  Harp.  Harp.  Mark in New York.  Hello?  How's that, Mark? 
[00:57:00]  It's wrong, but that's all right.  Okay.  You guys were talking about when this guy was pistol whipping him, that they never discovered  the gun.  You know, back in the 90s, early 90s, when we had the crack epidemic in New York, you  know, we always had a saying that the gun never hit the fork.  Because you could be chasing a guy, he throws the gun, you chase him half a block, you come  back, that gun is gone.  It's in the wind.  So just because they don't have the gun, that doesn't mean he didn't have it that time.  Not true.  We just think that, you know, it's easier if they had it, but I don't think that makes 
[00:57:30]  him innocent.  I'm starting to think he was probably guilty.  Probably, yeah.  He probably didn't.  I mean, I don't know.  And I don't know if it's like, it's important not to kill people, I guess, but I don't know.  It's very important.  I don't know.  But yeah, but I don't know if you want to like, use all this energy and rally behind  a guy that was a bum of a guy anyway.  He was a bum.  It's hard.  It's like the death penalty.  Again, I feel poor people get it more.  So that's why I've kind of, but I don't think it's cruel and unusual.  Like fucking Amnesty International, all these groups, they say it's cruel and unusual punishment, 
[00:58:00]  which is against the constitution.  But I don't think it is.  I just think that poor people get it more.  So we shouldn't have it.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's definitely accurate because they can't afford attorneys.  But yeah, I think probably protesting this guy's death penalty might have been a slight  waste of time.  However, in a perfect system, it probably was where there was, let's say the video, it  was the thing.  If you had video of somebody doing something in a perfect system, I'd be all for it.  Yeah.  I'd be all for dismembering people while they were alive.  Yeah.  I mean, torture.  Yeah.  I mean, if you had like concrete evidence, like there's no way we can come back later and 
[00:58:30]  say that with somebody else.  But yeah, you listen to legal.  Look, it's a big court.  It's a big day for us.  It sure is.  They have any of their case.  Troy Davis, he's dead, but he had his day in court.  He had his day.  He lost.  Didn't go so good for him.  He had like 15 days in court, didn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a lot.  Supreme Court did something for him they haven't done in 50 years.  But.  Which was consider a new trial.  Way to stop the chat. 
[00:59:00]  Boring fact.  Who cares?  Well, they considered it a new trial.  Wait, they considered it, but then they didn't give it to him?  Yeah, I guess that they heard evidence.  They found that the prosecution was right.  Yeah, I missed this whole thing, too, because when before right before I went to bed, it  was he had like some delayed execution thing.  So when I sent out the email that goes to all these guys, it was it was that he's alive  and they're going to delay everything.  And then I wake up and he's fried or not fried.  Rather, he's dead.  And I'm just like, oh, well, now I look retarded.  I got the news prep email and it was like, oh, looks like they're going to.  Yeah, they're not going to execute him.  And then I woke up. 
[00:59:30]  Woke up.  He's dead.  He's not alive.  Well, Obama couldn't have stopped it anyway.  They were trying to get Obama to intercede, but he wouldn't because it's a state issue.  Yeah.  And they and he couldn't have stopped it anyway.  The Supreme Court thought he didn't want to give him another trial because they were  like, all right, he's guilty.  Like we tried him where they felt maybe they felt that the trial.  I don't even know if it was about guilt or innocence.  I think they may have felt that the trial went through properly.  Yeah.  Travis, you don't you don't like that he got killed, though?  I don't really have that big of a problem with it. 
[01:00:00]  But, you know, like like Jim said, like, I don't have a problem with the death penalty  if if, you know, it's 100 percent like, you know, this guy is.  Yeah.  Like if there's no denying it, like like so guilty.  Right.  Yes.  Travis was a big West Memphis three defender for as long as I can remember.  I still am because he killed the kids.  There's no way that they did that.  Yay.  So, you know, I mean, there have been cases like the West Memphis three where it's  it's been proved that there are just, you know, yeah, terrible injustices. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  That happened.  But I mean, there's obviously more.  Although that Troy Davis was a bad person.  I would have been so happy if the West Memphis three got out of jail and said, we did it.  The documentary makers.  Oh, Eddie Vedder.  Yeah.  We got you, stupid.  We did it.  We killed those kids.  Like, I don't know why Mumia is a big in Philly.  It's Kumia with a C.  I've I've looked at the Mumia Abu-Jabal case, but I've never read it in depth.  But I don't know why people are so. 
[01:01:00]  I think he did get kind of a shitty trial.  There's a couple of things that I read I didn't like, but I still think he did it.  It's it's really.  I mean, I guess they killed somebody, so there's nothing more scummy than that.  But it's the worst when somebody does a crime and realizes that, well, there might be a  loophole somewhere so I can just trick everybody into thinking that I was, you know, that there  was injustice against me.  Yeah, it's it's I don't know.  It's just I saw a documentary recently on fucking on DNA evidence, and there's so many 
[01:01:30]  people that have gotten out of prison on DNA.  Yeah, that's scary.  And the fact what bothers me is that the state is wasting all this money when what they should  be doing is if you're in jail and there was any doubt for a rapist or a murderer or pedophile  and DNA can help you any prosecutor that fights DNA evidence.  And I know some fucking dickhead convicts will use it just to drag things out and delay  it. But any prosecutor that fights DNA evidence in a case like this should just be fucking  thrown off the prosecution force or whatever it is. 
[01:02:00]  Do you get badges if you're on the prosecution force?  We're trying to have a serious conversation.  I realized I didn't know where it was going.  I was going to say shot, but I realized that was too harsh.  Maybe disbarred?  Disbarred, yes.  Thank you.  You are no longer welcome on the prosecution force.  That's like the shitty ripoff copy of the Justice League.  Yeah, the prosecution force.  There's lawyers in capes.  A bunch of women with awful tits and perms named Marsha flying around.  Rob in New Jersey. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  Yes, sir.  So, yeah, this whole debate on the death penalty, my uncle, his name was Peter Voto, was killed  by Thomas Trantino back in the 60s.  It was called the Night at the Angel Lounge in Lodi, New Jersey.  Is that confirmed or are you making accusations?  No.  No, no, no, no.  It was confirmed.  He was convicted of it.  His partner was killed in New York City.  You know, they found him at a hotel and straightened him out quick.  But this friggin' animal, you know, he gets a death penalty. 
[01:03:00]  Then all of a sudden New Jersey overturns the death penalty and says, okay, you know, life  imprisonment.  And then they let him out on parole.  So explain that.  Well, they should have had life without parole.  Life without parole, was that an option when that was done?  Yeah.  I don't know why they didn't have parole.  How can you go from death penalty to having a paroled sentence?  I don't know.  Like, so he only got out because they did away with the death penalty, not because there  was new evidence.  Right.  He got on death row.  Then they converted his sentence to life imprisonment. 
[01:03:30]  And they put him not even in a jail cell.  He was in a friggin'.  I mean, if you look up, there's actually video.  Like, he did videos.  He wrote a book.  Like, and they put him in a, like a camper or some kind of mobile home on the jail and  shit.  You know, he married his lawyer.  Oh my.  So he had a happy life.  Yeah.  That's sickening.  I mean, I'm not talking about that.  How long did he do?  Yeah.  Three months.  Three months.  He was in jail for like 30-something years.  And he's like 67 years old now.  I mean, I got a good mind to just go find him and take care of business for my family.  But no. 
[01:04:00]  No, he still should just die in jail, though.  I mean, if you kill somebody, you should die in jail.  Yeah.  And I mean.  He killed him like a friggin' firefight.  Like, he jumped the cops coming into a bar, took their guns, pistol whipped them, stripped  them down their underwear, and shot them in the back of the head.  Jesus Christ.  And now he's writing books and stuff?  How do you beat up two cops and take their guns?  How the fuck is it?  The noise cop was a rookie.  They were responding to a noise complaint.  And it turned out that they'd been high on drugs, the two criminals, and they had stole  some money from the mob or some crap. 
[01:04:30]  So the rookie was outside, and my uncle went into the police bar, and they were behind  the door.  So when they came into the bar, they got him from behind.  The rookie went in without no weapon, came back out, called for backup, went back in  to help his partner, and he killed both cops.  Oh, wow.  He killed two cops?  Two cops, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  When you hear a case like that, on a moral level, I firmly believe those guys should both  just be shot in the fucking head for doing that.  Immediately.  My argument against that penalty is not about not thinking it's right. 
[01:05:00]  It's just, I just don't trust our system enough to know that only guilty people will  get it.  I agree.  You know, and especially from, you know, 20, 30 years ago, you know, people have been  on death row for 10, 15 years.  Yeah, okay, fine.  Maybe, you know, convert their sentence to life in prison in whatever it costs and make  them sit there and rot.  If the prosecutions were going out in these, in the cases where it's a little iffy, and  actually being the ones fighting to get DNA to make sure I would have a lot more faith  in it, like, if the state was making 100% sure that they hadn't fucked up in the past, 
[01:05:30]  but when they're fighting things like the Memphis Three because the prosecutors don't  want to look bad, it's hard to have faith in their judgment.  I think you just called them prosecutions.  Did I?  Yep.  Well, I like to pluralize, did I call them prosecutions, or what they have done was prosecutions?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe that's even better.  Oh, exactly.  No, I didn't.  I probably fucked up.  You won't.  Iraq, could you go back and get that, please?  We have to make sure if a mistake was made on this program.  One of us just made a mistake.  One of us made a mistake.  We have to find out who did it.  We have our own case to deal with.  Yes. 
[01:06:00]  Here on the OBI.  A heavy case.  Yeah.  This guy was, like, forced out of prison.  I'm reading about this guy that he just called in.  A three-member panel of the New Jersey Superior Court ordered the Department of Corrections  in June 2000 to release Trantino within 30 days and to immediately transfer him to a  halfway house on the basis of their finding that the parole board's decisions in the case  were unreasonable.  Unreasonable.  What?  He killed two cops.  Yeah.  It was unreasonable.  And they had a weapon, you know, a concession, everything, and it was unreasonable to keep 
[01:06:30]  him in jail.  In its ruling, the court stated that he had satisfied the terms of release and did not  pose a danger to commit any further crimes once paroled.  Now look up what he did five years, like three, four years ago, and he beat the shit  out of his girlfriend.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Well, he was better, though, I thought.  He was all fixed.  Yeah, no, that can't be true.  That's his ability.  Yeah, he was rehabilitated.  That's legal nonsense.  I guarantee that's just legality, because the terms of life in prison were probably  X amount of years to life, and he probably had offended in jail, so they probably had 
[01:07:00]  to let him go.  Not saying it's right.  Well, he was, yeah, he was.  She got life without parole.  His sentence was commuted to a single life sentence.  He was eligible for parole in 77 after serving 15 years in jail.  When did he get out?  2002.  After spending 30 years.  Wow, okay.  All right.  Somewhere in there.  Yeah, 2002.  Thanks a lot.  This is, uh...  Yeah, this guy's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Do you want to see...  He didn't go quietly away, then he got arrested again for beating the crap out of his girlfriend. 
[01:07:30]  I don't know what the hell happened.  I thought he was rehabilitated.  Yeah, I think he's fine.  Well, any time...  Let's be honest here.  Any time someone beats their girlfriend, it's wrong, but I always want to know what she  was saying first.  Right.  Like, what did she do to cause this?  Let's not jump to conclusions.  Thanks, Rob.  Was he talking...  She's talking during the game?  Yeah.  All right.  You want to, uh, see who made the mistake?  Eric's got the clip.  Of course he does.  If the prosecutions were going out and these in the case...  Yep, I made the mistake.  Yes!  Yes!  If the prosec...  If the prosecutions... 
[01:08:00]  They're called the prosecution force.  I'm not talking...  I'm not used to talking this early this much.  Yeah.  I usually get going at, like, fucking 8 o'clock when I have my coffee.  I wake up...  Dude.  Yeah.  Boom.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  You got your eggs, your coffee, your mind goes, boom, dude.  Open hand talk, you just relax, boom.  Rocco.  Fucking idiots on Metafest.  Farting up a storm.  This guy's a piece of shit.  Who, Rocco?  You didn't even talk to him.  He's a piece of shit.  Bob?  Just this guy.  Trantino. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, the guy who just...  Yeah, hang on.  It's like Rocco.  The guy that...  Yeah, I'm reading about when he was released...  He's released from jail again after beating his girlfriend.  Yeah.  And he's released, but he was still...  He was released...  Wait, he went back to jail, and then he was released again.  Yeah.  Oh.  But he was still a little cranky, complaining that he cannot shake the cop killer label he  carries for the murder of two police officers 41 years ago.  Oh, my...  I just can't shake this.  Yeah, just...  You know...  One hit wonder, I guess.  Rocco.  All right, what do you...  Do you guys think that if he got life in jail and he actually wanted to get, you know, 
[01:09:00]  executed, he should get executed?  Like, what do you think's the worst penalty?  Like, when guys who want...  It's like guys who want castration, pedophiles.  Mm-hmm.  It's hard to say, because a part of me thinks yes, and a part of me thinks, like, you can't  do suicide by cop, and you can't do suicide by state.  I don't know.  It's a tough question.  I never thought of it.  Yeah, I mean, I guess you have...  Because you can't...  You can't go case by case every single time.  You have to...  I mean, I would think there might be one... 
[01:09:30]  Some people would rather just be killed.  Yeah, but I think you should be...  You have to just deal with that to kill the people who need to be killed.  And lawyer men's might not allow that to happen.  Yeah.  And lawyer men's and prison peoples might fight that.  I don't know.  There's an Indian, Andrew the Indian, who wants to tell us about the old Indian way of handling  it.  And by the way, they won't let you hang yourself in.  They take your shoelaces.  The state has a certain responsibility for you once you're in incarceration.  That's where they can't kill you and blame it on suicide.  Yeah, but I've seen Oz, and I know they can get around that. 
[01:10:00]  I know.  Me too.  Remember out of BC?  Whose stick didn't get hard when he walked into the room?  I challenge you.  Yeah, exactly.  With his shirt off and his hand down his trousers.  Oh, my fucking God.  If I only knew he'd be on the plane on Lost, I know I'd have taken a trip.  Andrew the Indian, you're on the show.  Yeah, how we doing, boys?  Hey, uh, hey, uh...  Hey, uh, hey, uh, hey, uh, but listen, old W and EW, what I gotta say is, when, uh, when  there was something like this happening in the tribe back in the day, people were just, 
[01:10:30]  they would, that's it, they were just left.  Put them out on the edge of the camp, get the fuck out of here, just step away.  I'd take that over life in prison.  That sounds much better.  Like, okay, you have somewhere.  Yeah.  You have to leave Westchester.  Yeah, you gotta leave, you gotta leave anything, you know, what you're used to, you're out.  You're finished.  End of story.  I don't wanna see you anymore.  We don't wanna see you anymore.  You're away from everybody that held you dear.  Tough break.  We thought it was gonna be a harsh, like, fucking apocalypto-type treatment.  Just go away now.  Don't come back, you.  We're way better at punishing people. 
[01:11:00]  Check it out.  When there was a divorce, if the wife wanted to move her old man out, he just, she just,  she just put his moccasins outside the teepee.  No jokes.  But if she, if she wanted to get rid of her, he could cut her nose off.  Cut the tip of her nose off.  End of story.  Bitch, get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, but then how would she smell things?  I don't know.  I, you know.  I love the enthusiasm of Andrew who's telling these, like, stories that, like, he's giving  an example of the death penalty that's much easier than ours, but he's doing it, he's 
[01:11:30]  telling it in a way to make it sound like it's this mega thing, like, they made him leave!  They couldn't come back!  Yeah, he's saying with enthusiasm and muster.  On the Patrice tip, on the Patrice tip, why?  Why?  My question is, why are the cops always right?  Why is the state always right?  They're not.  Maybe, maybe, maybe Mumio wasn't wrong, maybe, you know, who knows, man, we're all fucked  up, but anyway, yo, Patrice, I love you, Jimmy, I love you.  Patrice is not here, sir.  Yes, yes, he is.  That's me.  I'm Patrice O'Neal. 
[01:12:00]  I know he's not there, but still, I love him.  Oh, okay, I love Patrice as well, but I love him more when he's here, not when he's  fucking a mist in the air and a memory.  You don't love him enough to just randomly say, you know who I love?  Yeah, I like to thank him in the middle of real conversations I'm having about other things.  That was a funny example, though.  Like, their death penalty sucks, the Indians, but they have a horrible way of dealing with,  like, any type of domestic dispute.  Like, you know, if you kill people, they just go, now, don't look at this anymore.  Yeah.  But if you fucking talk while the game is on, your husband can cut your clit off and  soccer kick it. 
[01:12:30]  Beautiful society.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But thank you.  Same joke twice.  It's funny.  Will in Houston.  Will in Houston.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Will in Houston.  A dude.  They get a problem or something.  I just wanted to call up and tell you guys about Robert Durst, the guy, the real estate  mogul's son in Galveston, who admitted in court to dismembering his victim with a paring  knife, two saws, and an axe, and he got off on self-defense. 
[01:13:00]  What were they coming at him with?  I don't know what the murder charges were, but, yeah, they were trying to convict him  and murder, and he got off on self-defense after admitting in court dismembering the  guy.  Well, maybe he was in a lot of danger.  Maybe he killed him in panic, and maybe that guy's limbs were jostling around.  Yeah, I don't know.  You don't know.  Check your facts, Will.  It might be an easier defense when you can hire the best defense attorney, and your dad's 
[01:13:30]  a giant real estate mogul worth billions of dollars.  It could be, but...  It helps.  Could be what Jim said, too.  You don't know.  Yeah.  Thank you, Will.  The more money you have, the more you can spend.  Good point, Jim.  But, you know, I mean, it's not always the most expensive lawyer that's going to do  the trick.  For instance, today, Club Soda Kenny is going to be the guy who goes into that courtroom.  He'll be the dumbest lawyer.  Yes.  Club Soda Kenny is going to go in, because the reason Opie and Anthony aren't here is  if you're just tuning in.  Yes.  They're both dead.  It's very sad.  They were found in a lover's tryst together in a vehicle. 
[01:14:00]  Jim and I have never been happier, because we're taking this gig full-time now.  They were found, and look, not to disrespect their memories, but they both had their pants  around their ankles and their hands on each other's penises, and it was just a tragic  accident.  They didn't realize the garage door was closed and the car was running.  I mean, that happens sometimes, but at least they left us like they would want to have left  us, you know?  Just tugging each other's puds.  Tragic edging accident.  Yeah, they said that Anthony was found with his head against the window and his hands 
[01:14:30]  up in the slow-down motion.  He was apparently telling Opie to slow down.  Opie was known as aggressive sexually.  Yeah, quick jerk McGillicuddy was his nickname around the office.  We kind of kept it under our heads.  I mean, there were a few times where there was, you know, physical incidents, scarring  would come in, and we knew what was going on.  We just never thought that it would get to this point.  We never thought that tragedy would strike.  We had warned the boys many times to always open, because they like to have the music  really loud, like in casinos, so nobody could hear them jerking each other off. 
[01:15:00]  Exactly.  God bless their souls.  They will be missed.  On that note, we'll take a break.  We'll be right back.  We should try to get one of them on the phone if they're awake.  Opie's awake.  They're dead.  Or not dead.  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks, Sam, for blowing the big...  Oh, sorry.  Twitterverse sculling.  I know.  Everybody was going for it.  We'll be back.  More.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s. 
[01:15:30]  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to National Grid, who decided to turn on the power at Foxborough  Stadium, rather than the town of Foxborough itself.  You should be hung up like pigs and slaughtered.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  I'd like to say fuck you to the guys who keep playing the same fuck-through line.  Stop doing it.  Change it.  Play something different.  Fuck you!  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to prime-time Sam Roberts.  I'm so sick of hearing you during Opie and Anthony, and then your stupid shit show after. 
[01:16:00]  I have to turn the fucking radio off, and your nails on a chalkboard voice, your smarmy,  sarcastic, overly obvious sense of humor.  You have no fucking balance.  You're annoying.  You're a piece of shit.  And I hate hearing you on the radio.  Shut the fuck up.  That fuck you!  Fuck you!  This fuck you is the Chip Chipperson.  I hope you fucking die.  I hope, uh, I hope, uh, yeah.  Fuck.  Fuck that one.  Fuck you!  This is after my two ex-wife that took everything.  My house, my car, my kids. 
[01:16:30]  Fuck you, cunt.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big F-U to Danny Ross.  I don't know why I'm doing it.  I just don't like him, and I don't like his face.  Fuck you, Danny Ross.  Go to hell.  Fuck you!  Hi, I'd like to just give a big F-U to the executives at XM who would stifle, slow down,  or criticize the art that comes out of this show as an Opie and Anthony.  Fuck you, dickheads.  Let them do their fucking show, and mind your own fucking business. 
[01:17:00]  Fuck you!  I have a big F-U to my ear hair for growing every fucking day.  And for my birthday last week, I got a goddamn fucking nose and ear hair trimmer for my family.  So, it's a fucking problem that everybody sees.  I have no fucking ear on my head, so F-U, ear hair.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I just wanted to give a big F-U to Troy Kwan for not following his name and decking  France here in the face.  Call the Opie and Anthony F-U line.  866-F-U-LINE-1.  That's 866-F-U-LINE-1. 
[01:17:30]  The virus.  Sirius XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, kind of.  Sons Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, Opie and Anthony are taking care of the biggest legal battle in the history of New York State,  possibly the country.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show versus Sandy Cain.  She's suing Opie and Anthony for a guitar being smashed and a hat being taken in small claims court. 
[01:18:00]  If nothing else, it's hilarious, but they'll be back tomorrow.  Eric, have you heard from Opie at all?  Yeah, I just got a text because I asked him if, hey, you have the hotline, do you want to call in?  And he told me to fuck off.  Well, why didn't you call him on the hotline?  I did.  He's not picking up.  Okay.  Well, I guess we won't be hearing from Opie then.  Well, you know what it is.  We have Brittany Andrews in today, who I think is really hot. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Big, giant tits.  And Levi Johnston, Sarah Palin's old, almost son-in-law.  Everybody knows who he is.  Yeah.  Apparently, Brittany Andrews is now a producer-director.  Oh, is that what she's doing?  That's what he says on the sheet that Roland just gave me.  She looks very good, too.  Why don't she still do porn?  I guess she's...  She did fetish stuff, too.  She was fucking hot, man.  I'm assuming she's producing and directing porn.  I didn't really read.  I'm glad that you brought that question up, because it would have been embarrassing. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, I know.  I didn't do much research on her at all.  I did none, I should say.  I'm lying.  Zero.  I did much.  Much.  I did zero.  Because I was too busy reading his book.  Well, she'll probably be more of a go-with-the-flow, let's-just-comment-on-what's-in-front-of-this-interview  than what's-his-name.  I'm trying to get a couple of questions.  I want to practice my Levi interview.  All right.  Who do you want to be Levi?  Danny can be Levi.  Okay, that'd be great.  I mean, Danny, do you want to take the role of-  I'll try.  I'll do my best.  Are you going to do Playgirl? 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  Okay.  Yes, I am.  I'm going to show my big Alaskan hog to everybody.  How tall is John McCain?  Oh, God.  Not a good question.  He's-  No, that's boring.  How tall is John McCain?  Yeah.  No.  No.  He met him.  I know, of course, he met him, but we could probably just look that up.  All right.  Do you have any other-  Do you fly Alaska air more because you're from Alaska?  That's stupid, too. 
[01:20:00]  I don't like these questions.  Yeah, those are dumb questions.  Do you know how bad I wanted to pre-record Chip calling in?  We got to do a pre-record Chip someday so I can do a fucking chip phone while I'm sitting  here.  Oh, and so you could just sit here and interview him, I think we have a call.  We have a call.  And then Chip picks up.  Yeah, Levi's, what do you got, your own jeans on or something?  You missed that I made that joke before you came in.  Oh, I didn't hear it.  Except Danny wasn't doing a character.  No, no, it was just completely legitimate.  We just be in Danny.  Legitimate humor here.  Oh, that's funny.  There's nothing worse than when Chip repeats something you've said in real life. 
[01:20:30]  It's humiliating for all to hear.  Yeah.  We could set that up if you want.  Yeah, I want to do that a couple times like, oh, no, Troy is pulling Travis away.  Why?  I just wanted to hear something quick.  Okay, cool.  Troy, are you, do you have any opinion on the Troy Davis case?  Yes.  No.  No.  You haven't done the research?  No.  Any, no opinions, but any questions?  No.  Okay.  It's a conspiracy. 
[01:21:00]  Troy's hat fits him because none of his hair is sticking out.  He looks like a child.  Yeah.  He looks like a small boy.  Straight brimmed hat.  Yeah.  Fucking our gang.  Beat it.  You know, you know, you know, you know, I don't trust anybody.  There's been an attempt on the life of President Kennedy.  You know, I want to see the body.  You know, you know, there's an agenda with our government.  We've been lied to before.  No.  It's one small step for me.  You know, do you know for sure?  I think you know.  It's a little hard to believe.  You know.  I don't trust anybody. 
[01:21:30]  You know, you know, you know, you know.  Is it the truth?  I don't know.  What were you thinking?  Who hit that?  Eric.  I love Eric.  Big Cole Stogie shirt.  What's a big Cole Stogie?  I don't know.  It's one of these ironic throwback shirts that Lucky sells.  Sometimes Eric's wife buys his clothes for him.  Sometimes.  I think all the time.  All of them.  Big Cole Stogie boy.  Stogie boy.  He's a big Cole Stogie boy. 
[01:22:00]  Why would you wear a t-shirt with a word that rhymes with hoagie on the front of it?  I didn't read it.  And it has an adjective that describes big.  Yeah.  It's big and Stogie.  And big Cole's.  Big Cole's.  Stogie.  It was yellow.  I didn't read it.  I just threw it on.  That's an excuse not to put it on.  Yeah, it's yellow.  Where's a yellow shirt?  To throw clam shatter on you.  I want to.  No, I was just going to ask if you heard what Florence Henderson said.  That she had.  Yeah, I did hear that.  I didn't hear her say it. 
[01:22:30]  Well, she put out a book, I guess.  And she was doing interviews yesterday, yesterday afternoon at like 2.30 or something.  But for some reason, at her age, she can't just kind of fade off into obscurity and be a TV legend.  She wants everybody to know everything.  And Florence Henderson said that when she was younger, she had a case of crabs.  And she got it from some politician, I think.  Somebody running for mayor, I think.  Well, we know who she didn't get it from.  Exactly.  Yeah, but I mean, what would possess you at this point in your life to be like, you know what? 
[01:23:00]  I need to tell the world that I one time had a case of crabs.  To sell books because there's nothing else to talk about.  You always got to reveal something to get people to talk about your book.  We're all talking about Florence Henderson.  There's got to be one quote.  I got to buy this book.  And then you buy the book and realize the only interesting thing in the entire book is that one time she had crabs.  You realize how boring chapters are, like, California, here I come!  With an exclamation point.  It's about her shitty trip to California.  Isn't it called Brady Secrets or something?  You know what the book is called? 
[01:23:30]  Life is not a stage.  Oh, maybe that's a chapter or something.  Life is not a stage.  Sometimes you get crabs.  Sometimes you let a donkey fuck you in your private life.  Not necessarily just in front of people in Tijuana.  She just wanted to cash in on everybody thinking of wholesome Mrs. Brady fucking some guy and giving her crabs.  At least that's a juicy tidbit.  I hate these fucking Brady books because none of them ever reveal anything.  Oh, Mike Lookendlin revealed that one time Robert Reed said shit because his coffee spilled.  Ooh. 
[01:24:00]  He cussed.  Ooh.  Or the save-by-the-bell-tell-all that stupid Screech came out.  It was just lies.  It's like he wrote, like, Zach and Kelly was in a threesome with the show producer and Slater used to hook up with, like, and then, you know, Lisa would fuck everybody on staff.  And, like, there's this whole list of things that Screech, I mean, they had to be made up because nobody gave them any credibility.  I kind of like the fact that at least he wrote interesting stuff, though.  You're going to lie and make it good.  Yeah, it was interesting.  She said she woke up to little black things crawling over her bed and body. 
[01:24:30]  It's Anthony's worst nightmare.  Wow.  Henderson immediately went to a doctor who helped her get rid of the creepy crawlers.  The creepy crawlers?  I have creepy crawlers on my vagina.  Please isolate that, too.  And Lindsay, the mayor's name was John Lindsay.  What was he the mayor of?  He was...  Crab Town is something, right, Travis?  No.  New York City.  I don't even need to laugh at that. 
[01:25:00]  John Lindsay?  Wait, the mayor of New York, they were crabs?  John Lindsay.  Is that that Lindsay?  Former mayor of New York City.  That's a pretty good fucking story.  It's a nice little tidbit.  From 66 to 73.  Mike Bloomberg got my ass hairs greasy.  But this guy gave her...  You put a pedestrian plaza in your asshole.  He put potted plants on my balls.  Theo LaGuardia made my cock swell.  He stepped on it with the heel of his lifts.  Is Lindsay still alive?  No, Lindsay died in 2000.  So he went from 70... 
[01:25:30]  Gosh, noshed on her pussy.  He went from 73 to 2000 thinking, oh, nobody's ever going to find out about it.  And then Florence Henderson has to embarrass the rest of his surviving family by announcing  he had crabs and gave it to her.  He sent her flowers in an apology letter.  Oh, I know.  That's hilarious.  Got the medcock.  Sorry, babe.  Yeah.  I bet they made that Brady Bunch tinkle-ink-a-link noise when they walked on her pussy. 
[01:26:00]  Have you...  You've never had crabs, have you?  I've had them three times.  You have?  Yes, of course.  Because Ron Jeremy always said that's the only STD that he ever got is crabs.  Because I remember you saying that as much as you have had sex with hookers with no condoms,  crabs is the only thing you've gotten.  Crabs I got three times, twice from the same girl in a week.  This black girl I fucked when I was 19.  But to get crabs twice in a week, that means you have to be cured and then get them again.  Yeah.  She wasn't really...  I knew I had them.  I felt them the next day. 
[01:26:30]  I felt something and I looked down and it's really a violating feeling when there's insects  on your pubes.  Because I have awful straight pubes, like a Chinese man's hair.  Yeah.  My pubes are an abomination.  And you can see them.  Of course you can.  They're black.  They're black.  They pull it off and the little legs were going.  Wrong one.  Boo!  Thought it was little tinkle toes.  No.  So I pulled the crab off and I went and got rid of medication, which is...  It's like a weird shampoo and you have to run this comb through your balls to get the nits 
[01:27:00]  and eggs.  Oh.  And you have to hot...  They're laying eggs in your pubes?  You have to hot wash everything really hot.  And there was no recurrence.  But a week later, I fucked the same girl again.  I had a feeling she gave them to me, but I was...  What was it?  I had a feeling.  I wasn't a pussy getter at 19.  So you were like, well, I'll just use the shampoo again.  But I went home.  It's amazing my dick stayed hard for that.  I really was a trooper when I was 19.  Yeah.  And I went home and I saw one of my pubes.  I already had the...  I already had...  So I'm like, okay, it was her who gave them to me. 
[01:27:30]  You were like, you're like, look, it's probably her.  That makes the most sense.  But I'm not going to jump to conclusions.  Let me do a little investigating.  Let me fuck her again and see if I can reinfect.  You cured yourself of crabs, and then you just went and caught them immediately again.  But it wasn't bad the next time because I just fucking hopped right in the shower with  the shampoo and I was gone.  And then years later, maybe four or five years later, this girl I was dating shaved her pubic  hair.  So I think she cheated on me and got them.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  And then I wound up getting them.  But I think I was just starting to stand up.  So I was like, it might have been from a hotel or something.  Or she didn't know when she got them.  From a hotel?  She cheated on me, I think, and got them.  I bet she did.  Which is fine.  Well, at this point, I think you're probably moving past it.  I'm over it.  And that's why I fucking, I like that all chicks should shave their pussies.  Well, I was going to say that.  If you just shave your pubes, you'd get rid of them, right?  Yeah.  So you wouldn't even need to shave a pub.  You have to shave it.  No, they could be in your ass hair or your legs.  Oh, God.  Or your fucking eyebrows.  Did you ever get crabs?  No, no.  Okay.  But I'd love you to. 
[01:28:30]  And that beard.  How great would that be?  That's something that I was thinking of.  Because, I mean, you could shave your pubes and balls and stuff.  But, I mean, you know, a lot of people have body hair that's, I'm sure, perfectly capable  for crabs to live and crawl around to your ass and nipples.  I hate to be Greek and have crabs in my back hair.  I'm fucking awful.  You know how much fucking, like, Egyptians and Palestinians must hate crabs?  I don't know if they're hairy or not.  Some Egyptian will call in, I'm as smooth as butter!  Does that mean Florence Henderson had to take R.A.I.D. shampoo?  R.A.I.D.  R.A.I.D. 
[01:29:00]  It should be R.A.I.D.  It's bug spray.  I'll bet you she has really long ass hair and she had to comb it out.  She had to comb through her.  Eve Plum had to come in and trim her asshole hair.  And Ann B. Davis yanked them out and fed them to Sam.  That's the sound of the dead crabs hitting the toilet as she punched herself in the pussy.  Yeah, that's them marching off her clit into the toilet.  And their dad had to sit the kids down and explain to them, 
[01:29:30]  Your mom has crabs.  Yes, yes.  Well, you remember that free trip to New York we all took?  Well, that didn't come without a price.  Yeah.  Luckily, I don't mind if your mom cheats on me.  Exactly.  Because he fucked me in the ass, too.  Yeah.  So your mom has crabs in her vagina.  Mine are in my asshole.  Yes, and mine are in my poofy perm.  Yeah.  It's my hair that was amazing in roots.  Do they crawl up your whole body?  I imagine if enough time goes by...  Like if you don't wash?  You can get them everywhere.  If you...  But you'd notice, I guess, right away.  But if you just kind of pretended they weren't there and you just showered regularly... 
[01:30:00]  No way.  You wouldn't get rid of them?  No, because they burrow into your balls.  Like...  Oh!  But you can pull them out.  Like...  They're not...  Like little ticks or something?  They're not like ticks.  No, I think they come out...  I remember pulling one out and I'll never forget the legs going and pulling one off my pubes.  And it was fucking violating, man.  Yeah, because you have little bugs just crawling on you.  They must feel like they're inside you.  But they're not...  To me, they're not nearly as bad as like bed bugs would be.  Because crabs are get-rid-able.  Like what you gotta do is throw out your fucking sheets or like... 
[01:30:30]  They're not gonna infect your whole house like fleas or nits.  They're just gross.  Even when you put new sheets on your bed, don't you just feel like they're there still?  I don't remember.  I think they're just really hot, hot washing.  My sheets were okay.  Bed bugs would freak me out a lot more.  What about lice?  Never had them.  But again, kids would get them in school.  Yeah.  But, uh...  My sister had lice when she was a kid.  Because she had hair that was long enough to like sit on.  So she had really long hair.  And she ended up getting lice when she was like in second grade or first grade or whatever. 
[01:31:00]  And the whole house was just covered in plastic.  She ended up cutting all of her hair off.  Yeah, fucking lice are awful.  You just don't want them.  But I...  Crabs are worse.  No, I think lice are worse because, uh...  Lice are, uh...  I think don't lice jump?  Yes.  Lice jump.  Crabs don't.  Crabs just grab onto your balls and drink.  Crabs are like actually good chicks.  Somebody's...  Are crabs just lice that live in your...  Like, do lice travel?  Off your head?  I guess.  I mean, I don't think it's a hobby.  It's like...  Oh, it's going down there. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, they'll pack and leave your cock to go somewhere for a weekend.  Going up north for the vacation.  Yes, we're vacationing in Bob's Asshole.  Oh, I just pictured crabs in Danny's beard.  I can't stop thinking about it.  Just crawling up his chest and up his neck hair and into his beard.  And he just keeps itching while he's trying to talk.  He's doing show prep in the office without realizing there's little bugs falling out of his beard.  Yeah, they're fucking getting stuck in the phone as he talks.  If he had crabs in here, if anybody had crabs in here, and they fell out of his beard, like onto his keyboard, would we be in danger of crabs for sharing an office? 
[01:32:00]  Nah, I don't think so.  You'd see them.  You can get them from a toilet, though, I think.  I've heard that.  Yeah.  Where do they live off of, though?  I mean, if there's someone before you, use it right before you.  I imagine the porcelain is hard for the little guys to hold onto because they're like skin and hair.  Do they hurt when they bite?  No.  They just tickle because their little feet are going like ee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee on your balls.  You feel it?  Of course.  Oh.  That's how I do.  I had them.  You itch.  And you can, like, like.  You're scratching because they're walking. 
[01:32:30]  You feel like there's bugs moving on your groin.  Yeah.  And then you look down and see there are bugs moving on your groin.  A lot of times you'll see them, and they're in the very base of where they are is where the hair meets your skin.  Oh.  And you'll see a black bump, and you're not sure if it's just a hair bump, and you pull it out, and you'll go, oh, no.  That wasn't just a hair bump.  I mean, pardon the interruption of crabs talk for a second, but Kenny, are you?  Speaking of crabs, you should have said.  Are you?  Have you ever had crabs?  I don't have any STDs.  I'm not asking if you have. 
[01:33:00]  Have you?  I mean, crabs is something you get rid of.  I said I've never had any STDs.  You said I don't have any.  I've never had any.  Oh, okay.  Are you headed down to the courthouse?  You have to have a sexual relation to get those.  I hate your fucking, I hate your double-tied manila envelope.  It's got the two red things on it with the string between them.  It's secured.  That's the evidence.  It's all right here.  Oh, my God.  You're going to set our boys free today.  Yes, I am leaving now.  I hope he gets them fucking like eight years in real prison. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  That's illegal to shoot a hat.  To shoot a hat that has been defecated into some old law, like the Western days.  He's just going to get everybody in contempt of court.  No.  What do you think?  I'm going to be like Al Pacino in that movie?  What movie?  I don't know.  What movie was that?  I'm not helping you.  So are you headed down there?  Yes, I'm going to get to talent.  I mean, the defendants.  And then we're going down there.  Where's Ant? 
[01:34:00]  We're doing some trial preparation.  No, no.  Meaning, I know where Opie lives.  You're picking Opie up.  Are you picking Ant up there?  Or is he meeting you down there?  Kenny has, like...  It's not a secret.  He won't give information that is not...  Oh, I forgot.  Okay.  Like, you could just say...  I'm going to go ahead and say this.  I hope I'm not incriminating everybody.  Ant stayed in the city last night.  That's right.  What?  I know you didn't want the information to be out there.  In the same city that he's going to court in?  Kenny, how could you let that leak out? 
[01:34:30]  New York City.  And I'm sorry that I let this out before the trial began.  Anthony's in the Big Apple.  Oh, great.  That's right.  Yeah, there's...  Kenny just stares at the microphone.  He just shrugged to the microphone pretty much.  He could have just said the words, I don't know.  That would have helped someone.  Yeah, where was he?  Audible medium.  I'm leaving.  All right.  Well, best of luck.  And please...  Call an update.  Call in.  Yeah, because Opie told E-Rock to go fuck himself when E-Rock asked if we wanted to get an update. 
[01:35:00]  I haven't had the balls to call Ant.  Good one.  So, yeah.  I mean, we would love to hear from you guys.  Even if Opie and Anthony don't want to talk, just to hear from you would be a blessing.  I'll put status updates on shitty Facebook.  Why don't you just call me?  I hate the new fucking Facebook.  You do?  You've gotten more angry as the day's progressed.  It just annoys me.  Why don't we get Zuckerberg on the phone?  Eric, can you get me Zuckerberg?  I could actually get Zuckerberg.  You could.  He's been to one of my shows, yeah.  Zuckerberg did?  No, I lied. 
[01:35:30]  I just want to see what that would feel like to say.  I could actually get you.  The big shot came to see me.  Everyone was really excited all of a sudden.  Yeah, no, it was actually Ted Zuckerberg.  He was a different guy.  Jim, I'm a big fan of your comedy.  I have Facebook, but there's a comma between.  They're different sites.  Bull.  Face.  Comma.  Book.  How do you visit that URL?  Facebook.com.  Well, Kenny, Godspeed to you today.  I know that Opie and Anthony are going to come out unscathed because Club Soda Kenny attorney at law is on the case. 
[01:36:00]  Don't misrepresent.  Well, you're acting as an attorney.  I'm not an Esquire.  Fair enough.  Well, what can we call you then?  Well, I do have certain kind of professional licenses, but that is not one of them.  All right, well, you're acting as an attorney today.  No, I can't act.  You're filling the role.  They're acting as their own attorney.  So what are you doing with all that evidence in your hand? 
[01:36:30]  I'm like a legal aide.  Okay.  Good luck.  You won't need it.  I'm like the other kind as well.  You like that?  All right.  Have fun with the show.  Bye, Kenny.  Thank you.  I hope we hear from you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Real quick before we move fully on from crabs.  Yes.  A couple of people wanted to share their stories.  Gordon in South Carolina.  Hey.  How are you guys?  Jimmy, like you, I was 19 when I first got crabs. 
[01:37:00]  Unfortunately, however, it was my first time having sex.  I actually lost my virginity and got crabs in return.  And I was still living at home with my parents, and I didn't have any money.  But I found some dog shampoo, flea and tick shampoo, under the sink in the bathroom.  And believe it or not, it actually worked, and I got rid of the crabs using dog shampoo.  Wow.  My only.  Let that be a lesson to all of you out there with crabs.  Exactly.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Just get some dog shampoo. 
[01:37:30]  Dugan in New Jersey.  Good morning, boys.  Hello, Dugan.  We had some fun crab facts that there's actually two times.  Thank God.  I was just thinking that the jam show with Jim and Sam, or Jam in the Morning, whatever  they called this show, didn't have enough crab fun facts.  We had stories and fun facts.  You should go on a menu, and there's like an Arby's.  Yeah.  Fun facts about crabs.  Yeah.  There's pube crabs, and there's head lice.  Yeah, we know that.  I mean, I know they both exist. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, I know those.  There's not a fun fact.  Head lice and pube crabs.  Yeah.  Yeah, but pube crabs stay in your pubes.  They don't leave.  They don't crawl like other places.  That's why you got head lice and pube crabs.  But what about in your asshole, like Jim suggested?  Well, you know, the nether regions.  Okay, so they will crawl in the taint area.  Yeah.  But what if you're a hairy guy, and your hair kind of...  I mean, there are guys who have enough hair that it kind of connects...  They probably like the warmth of your crotch and asshole.  Especially if you wear like tighty-whities.  Yeah, and especially if you're like, say, you're an ethnic, like you're from the Mediterranean. 
[01:38:30]  You have nice, warm, hot balls and ass cheeks.  Yeah, and just cozy in your briefs.  Well, I imagine if your whole body smells like ass, they might like that.  Maybe.  All right, thanks, boys.  Punch it out.  Yeah, bye.  All right, thanks.  Props to Kenny.  No, Kenny's not here anymore.  I'm on an Esquire.  Kenny, he has a way of saying things.  They're both hilarious and completely derailing. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Like, you laugh at what he says, but there's no place to go after what he says.  Nowhere.  I mean, he does nothing.  I wanted to mention something from yesterday, too.  Oh, yeah.  We were asking why we couldn't get Jonah Hill in studio.  Yeah.  We don't have an answer.  I don't think it was him personally.  I don't think he said, fuck, hoping Anthony.  I think it's just...  No, I mean, I talked to Roland, and he said that it's Roland's understanding that he had  a limited amount of time to do some stuff.  He did a bunch of TV.  He's been a Howard fan forever, and he's never done Howard, so he did Howard. 
[01:39:30]  Howard, I have no issue with...  I don't think I should be...  You guys, the fans, we appreciate you guys being loyal, but you don't have to attack the  guy on Twitter, because it wasn't like he said anything bad about the show, or said  he didn't want to do the show anymore.  I wish he would have come in a few minutes early.  Yeah.  There's a balance, because, again, I do other shows when I'm on the road, and I wouldn't  blow off a show that I had been loyal to to do any other show.  Yeah.  I would try to do both.  There's a way to do both.  Yeah, I think there is. 
[01:40:00]  But don't kill the guy on Twitter, is what I'm saying.  Because, I mean, yeah, let him have his day in court, if we're theming the show, because  he did, like, last time he was in here, the first thing he said was, you guys are great,  you guys had me on before anybody else would.  Like, he remembers the show, so it's like, he didn't come in this time, he should have,  but he didn't.  He'll, I'm sure, he'll come in next time.  The hard thing, the hard thing about it, it's a really weird line we walk, like, you  know, because radio has egos like everybody else, but Roland had been, it wasn't like  it was a last minute trip, and, oh yeah, he just decided to go in and do that, and he 
[01:40:30]  didn't have time or whatever.  Roland said he had been trying to get him, and he couldn't, and he was repeatedly told  no.  So, it's like, again, I think that was probably somebody on his, I would say, team, or one  of those people behind the scenes, probably just going, no, no, he's just doing this.  But it's like, why would you just have to do that, like, instead of a show that's taking  care of you?  Yeah, I mean.  So, I still wish he would have come in, but I'm saying, don't, you know, don't kill you.  Yeah, he's, plus, I mean, a lot of it probably has to do with, he doesn't make his own schedule. 
[01:41:00]  But I can't see myself going to Seattle and blowing off BJ Shea.  Yeah.  Who's a friend of mine, who's taking care of me when I was there for any radio show,  or I can't see myself blowing off Toucher and Rich in Boston, or any of the guys that  were good to me.  Like, I'm sure, I'm sure that he knows we're here in New York.  He may not remember that we're in the same building as Howard Stern.  He knows.  You think so?  Absolutely.  People always know.  You could forget at times, yeah, you know what, I've actually gone to, I've gone to studios 
[01:41:30]  and not realized that I was in the same building I was in.  The last time I was in town.  Especially because he hasn't done Howard, so that whole wing of the building was foreign  to him.  But when you're a fan of Howard and you come into this building and you know he broadcasts  right there.  You're right.  He knows, no one doesn't know where Howard works.  You're right, you're right.  So I kind of wish he would have come in.  And also, there's, we've been bitching about a video element to the show.  So this is where it kind of hurts because the video department here is small.  And yesterday we have Amy Schumer on.  And she's great as always. 
[01:42:00]  She's very funny.  And she's talking about something that's topical.  It's in the news.  It's like, you know, her, her, her, the Ryan Dunn joke and her reaction to it.  And she had mentioned it on a couple of late night shows, but we have her here in studio.  We're filming it.  And we have nowhere to go with the video.  Yeah.  It's just really, you know, this is a media company and they do a great job with a lot  of things, but their video department just is not up to speed.  They probably should get another person because if somebody's out for whatever reason, or  even, I mean, it slows down. 
[01:42:30]  If it's just a matter of editing video, I don't see there's any reason why they can't bring  on a couple web team interns and just edit.  But like, there are lots of college kids who know how to edit video.  That's a missed opportunity.  And what happens is when you miss opportunities, it's like this, this company is all about  getting press.  Like they hire people to get press, which are, it's smart.  Yeah.  We should be all about getting press.  You should be getting press because it's free.  But when you have chances like this and you miss them, it's like, not that the Amy Schumer  thing is dead, but the more time passes, the more she talks about it in other places. 
[01:43:00]  You're not associated with it.  It's just.  Yeah.  And I mean, and, and, and people do have an extremely short term memory.  I mean, it's not like the attention span of people who visit sites.  I mean, it's nil.  So you need, I mean, something like that would need to change almost on a, on a, on a daily,  like every other day basis for it to be relevant.  Machine roast was huge on Monday, big on Tuesday, still talked about on Wednesday.  And today we're like mentioning it like every day.  It gets less and less.  Yeah.  And, uh, the show does not have a proper website, but then again, I don't need to eat 
[01:43:30]  a bullet.  I appreciate Paul field did some just to work to spruce it up and I, I appreciate him doing  that, but I need to have a real overhaul on it because I keep forgetting like the website.  You do need it, but like all that chip TV stuff.  Like I've been kind of fucking laxing on it.  Like I'm always saying to open it, like you guys got to fix that website, but I'm not doing  it for mine either.  So it's hard to get moving on that stuff.  Well, I, I, Opie and Anthony are developing separate websites.  I know.  Are they really?  Yeah.  It's, it's so weird with the partnership.  Yeah.  Cause it's, people think like, does that mean the show is breaking up?  No. 
[01:44:00]  They're not breaking up.  Because they both also have major side projects and that's healthy.  Like you have a side project as well.  It's not like when you go and do standup or promote your Leno gigs, it means you don't  want to do the show.  It means you do ONA, you do Leno, you do standup.  I think it's weird.  Like I would love to ask those guys cause I've never asked them.  And I know them both really well, but I've never even said to them, what is it?  When you're part of a team, is there a part?  I think what happens is cause it's like a marriage and, and creatively you both are, you  love doing what you do, but Opie has his life.  Anthony has his life. 
[01:44:30]  And it's like, they both have other interests and you want to creatively, you don't want  to have to call another person every time you want to do something at three in the  afternoon.  Yeah.  I mean, as a comedian, your whole thing, like that's the one performer where you're  completely by yourself.  Like you write your own stuff, you go up by yourself, you do anything.  Can you imagine like being part of a comic team?  Like I didn't realize they were developing there.  I didn't even know that they are.  Yeah.  They're, they're developing, but you know, and that's kind of along with what they've  been doing, like Anthony with the compound stuff and Opie with the YouTube channel.  Um, so I just think they should have a site with both of them on it and then, yeah, 
[01:45:00]  I mean, I definitely think that the show needs a website.  Drive traffic to those.  I don't think the individual sites are bad to have at all.  No.  I just didn't know they were doing it.  But it'd be nice.  It'd be nice for the, for the show to have a website.  They do, there's a Facebook page.  Facebook is just not the same.  Yeah, but that's, it's, it's gonna.  It's just not the same.  It's not.  No, I mean.  I'm sure.  You need a website with links to your Twitters and your Facebooks.  No, that's irrelevant.  There's a really weird thing with videos.  Like viral videos are so hard. 
[01:45:30]  Like Louie has tapped into something because he's really great at doing them.  I mean, like when he walked into the pool, I mean, he's just a creative fucking editor,  director.  But like once you start, once you latch onto that, if you have one place, I mean, Opie  has Opie Radio.  That's the thing.  The website would drive more traffic than Opie Radio because more people know Opie  and Anthony as a brand name.  Like.  And all those videos could be on the Opie and Anthony site.  So many viral videos don't mean anything because you watch them and they get millions  of hits.  But in the end, you don't know what, where they came from. 
[01:46:00]  You don't care who posted them and you forget about them when you're done.  You do need a home base.  Like you need to be able to say, oh, what, what's this guy from?  One click away.  I found out recently, um, a girl I dated years ago while I was working here and, uh, we never  had, you know, we broke up and we kind of remained casual friends and I find out she's  fucking got these online videos.  They're exercise videos, but like, you know, they have like 800,000 hits.  Do you think they're all being watched for the exercise part? 
[01:46:30]  Oh, she's actually really good at what she, I don't want to say what she does, but she's  really good at it.  But, uh, it's fucking amazing to like, and she has like this central place that everybody  goes to fucking, I'm like, wow.  And that's all she does.  Her videos have a lot more hits than ours.  She's not famous for other stuff?  No.  Wow.  No.  It's just, a lot of guys probably jerk off to them.  Yeah.  I know I have.  I would think so.  Yeah.  Like, how dumb am I?  Exactly.  Before you got to the website, they each had like 50,000 views and now they have 800,000.  But it just, I, I, I was just amazed at like, this is what you can do on the 
[01:47:00]  web without a radio show even.  Yeah.  You can have a fucking real web presence and a real fucking career without a radio show.  But you do need a home base.  You have to have a fucking home base.  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm sure I could find a web guy and there's a hundred web guys who would  redesign your website, but I know one specifically that would like to.  Yeah.  My, my agent handles a lot of bands and they have people that have been offering to do  it that do, but I want to get it done.  I keep saying I'm going to get it done.  I just got to put the money into having it done.  Yeah.  Um, there's a couple of people who are desperate to tell crab stories. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  You know what?  We can never get it.  And look, Brittany Andrews is coming in and she did porn and fetish.  I mean, they, they have probably dealt with, I think Bella Donna one time said she had  one in her eye.  A crab?  Yeah.  Oh.  But it was actually the seafood restaurant.  Oh.  That was Jim realizing that was a chip joke and quickly covering.  That's the best part about chip.  That like you can bomb and then real quick in the end, just add it.  Yeah, I know that all of a sudden I'm a big cold stogie boy.  How is stogie boy in there? 
[01:48:00]  He's doing okay.  By the way, that's what happens when you have a, a big cold stogie boy is a nickname for  the rare, but, but, but feasible, very solid flu shit.  You say I dropped a big cold stogie boy.  Eric, did you know that before you got the shirt?  It always comes back to me being fat or shit.  I'm not saying you're fat.  I'm saying a big cold stogie.  Yeah, I'm not saying that either.  I'm saying that you're a fat shit.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, Dan.  Dan.  Dan.  We weren't going there.  I did it.  Is it fat stogie?  Oh, Travis. 
[01:48:30]  I think that.  No, I'm just asking.  Oh.  I just want to know what big cold stogie sounds like because, I mean, I know, I know what  Eric sounds like, obviously, and I know what the virus sounds like, but I've never even  heard big cold stogie.  I would love to hear it.  No.  Yeah.  There's no, I hope he's not here to force him to do stuff.  We technically don't carry boss juice.  There's no way I'm doing anything and you.  A big cold stogie, that's a flu shit that is really solid and actually, if you step back  from the ball, it comes above the rim. 
[01:49:00]  Ew.  That's a big cold stogie boy.  Eric, you knew that before you got it?  No, I didn't.  And they're really dark because you've been taking Pepto because you have the flu.  Oh, that's disgusting.  Why is this shirt yellow, Eric?  It doesn't make any sense.  Yeah.  It should be dark brown.  I just wore it because it was yellow.  That's all.  I didn't know it was white.  Why is that a good thing?  Exactly.  I don't have any yellow shirts that I certainly wouldn't wear it because.  Big cold stogie boy's the sun.  Eric, I feel, Eric is like, because I've got shirts that like, if I wear them, I'm like, 
[01:49:30]  I know I'm going to have to be prepared to explain it or take shit or at least have an  argument for it.  So sometimes I'll wear them, sometimes I won't, depending on my mood.  There's no way that Eric thought that that shirt would draw any attention because it shouldn't.  It's just, Eric happens to be wearing it and it says stokey boy on it.  By the way, let's take the crab calls because I'm going to want to take a break before.  Miss Brittany.  I would not like to make her wait.  Of course not.  We may have to go right from her into Levi if he comes in after. 
[01:50:00]  So let's take a couple calls and take a break and I'll make love.  All right.  We got a plan for the rest of the show.  I love a plan.  Larry in Florida.  Hey, love you, Jim.  I can't stand you, Sam.  Oh, wait.  Hey, Dad, good timing because we got a hotline call.  Oh, hotline call.  Larry should have insulted Samuel.  Put him on.  Take him off hold.  Take him off hold.  Take him off hold.  Take him off hold.  Put him on hold.  Let me pick him up.  No, no, no, no.  It's a real comedy of errors here, guys. 
[01:50:30]  Might not be for the air, Sam.  Oh, so why wouldn't you call a cell phone?  Does that mean I have to talk to Larry after he insulted me?  Well, let's hang on.  Sex man.  Or I'm sorry.  I haven't hung up on you yet, Larry.  Big call, Stogie.  No, it's Kenny.  He's asking Sal to go grab something from the office and bring it downstairs.  Oh, boom.  Why would you call the hotline?  Boom.  Hi, sir.  Larry, what do you want?  Start your call over from the beginning, sir.  Yeah, repeat what you said.  Nice. 
[01:51:00]  That's not funny.  I love you, Jim.  Thank you.  Sam, you're all right, I guess.  You know, I got crabs like when I was 19, and I had no idea what they were, so I went  to the doctor.  What could they have been?  What did you think they were, small dinosaurs?  I was a kid.  I didn't know.  See you in the days.  It was a really, really bad infestation.  Okay.  So I went to the doctor, got this stuff, put it on there.  About two weeks later, I feel this shit crawling up my chest, into my beard, and it ended up 
[01:51:30]  infesting in my eyebrows, too.  It was so bad.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  They were, like, infested in my eyebrows, in my beard, in my chest, but they weren't  in my pubes anymore, so Commissioner Gordon, he don't know what the fuck he's talking about.  They will travel wherever your hair's at.  How do you get them out of your eyebrows and beard?  Well, I used this medical shampoo that the doctor gave me, and it killed the shit in my  pubes, but I didn't know that they had moved up my chest, and about a week or so later... 
[01:52:00]  It chased them out, like when an exterminator comes and clears your house, and all the  mice run to your neighbor's house?  They ran up to your beard and eyebrows?  Yeah, it was pretty disgusting.  I gotta admit, it was, like, the worst thing I've ever had.  That's horrible, Larry.  Horrible.  No, go ahead.  No, I was just gonna say, it's not anything good.  If anybody gets them, go to the doctor, get them taken care of, don't be spreading them 
[01:52:30]  around.  And the bad thing was, I was still fucking this chick about a month later.  And her pubes threw her back.  I didn't know why she had shaved her pussy.  That's kind of the same thing that happened to me.  Yeah, she shaved her pussy.  I came back.  I didn't know why.  And then about, you know, a few days later, I'm infested all over the place.  Oh.  And she wasn't even a whore.  She was a really fucking nice girl.  Yeah, but I mean, she had crabs.  She was probably a little bit of a whore.  She was fucking around on me, but...  Yeah, I would think so. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, you know what I was just thinking?  What's that, Danny?  Like, you know, a lot of people, they sleep and they have pets in the house.  And I'm not making any peanut butter jokes, but like, you know, dogs sleep in the same  bed with people.  Yeah.  That's just a fact.  Now, can crabs live, like, in your pet?  Oh, my God.  Larry.  And then give it back to you?  Like, could that happen?  Can crabs live in your pet?  I don't think so, because they're more...  I don't know.  They probably could, but they're...  You know, they get fleets.  Crabs just like how human balls smell.  Because if the dog sleeps on the bed... 
[01:53:30]  But do crabs don't jump, though?  But they can still live on a...  I mean, I would assume...  They go on a sheet if you're that close.  I mean, look, if they're making it to eyebrows and shit, they can make it to your dog, right?  They can definitely crawl.  That's horrible.  Oh, boy.  Jim, I hope you don't mind a little controversy on the show.  Because Seth says that this guy is lying.  Seth.  Oh, I'm lying?  Okay.  Yeah, hey, Jim, you had a beard when you were 19 for some crab food.  That's for...  He means Larry, not you. 
[01:54:00]  Larry, not me, sir.  Yes, yes, I had a beard at 19.  Why do you want me to say I'm a hairy motherfucker?  I don't know about that.  Nah, that's fine.  That's believable.  Yeah, I knew kids in high school.  Yeah, I knew kids in junior high school with full beard.  I knew guys in other schools that had them, too, right?  You're just trying to one-up everybody's trip.  He's trying to one-up it.  Don't pay him no attention.  My elementary, my dear Watson.  You see, Dan, I told you not to pay any attention to him.  Thank you, Larry.  Why wouldn't you?  It's the best in the world.  No, because he just keeps going. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  And he doesn't realize when to leave well enough alone.  Let's go to the well or something.  What, are you going to get some water?  Are you thirsty?  I'm not thirsty.  No, I'm not thirsty.  Now you're doing it.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, fellas.  How are you doing today?  Hi, Dave.  It was good until Chip showed up.  Oh, sorry about that.  So I was kind of like in the same position as Jim.  I think I was a little bit more of a sex addict.  I used to have hookers come into my parents' basement while they were upstairs asleep. 
[01:55:00]  Like 1, 2 in the morning.  I had like no fear of getting caught.  I did the same thing.  Really?  Yes, I had a pregnant prostitute spark up a crack pipe.  In your parents' house?  Yes, where my grandmother used to sleep before she died.  Was your mom and dad at home?  It was fast asleep upstairs, dreaming that their son wasn't garbage.  And a pregnant prostitute was smoking a crack pipe.  Ain't much pregnant.  Oh, my God.  No bullshit.  Oh, you have life experiences, Norton.  Yeah, it's true. 
[01:55:30]  All right, so now that I've been one-up, so this girl comes in.  I can tell she's dirty, but does that stop me?  No.  I go ahead and hid it anyway.  The end of the night, she's leaving.  It's cold out.  Not only does it cost me $150, she steals my socks.  I wake up the next morning.  I am itching like there's no tomorrow.  But you knew she had crabs.  No, I knew I had crabs the next morning.  I didn't know she had them the next morning.  But, man, this is an itch.  It's unmistakable.  You will never forget this type of itch. 
[01:56:00]  Jim, you remember?  Is it that bad?  Oh, my God.  It's brutal.  But I didn't know nothing, so I just went.  I said, well, what is this?  I said, what do I do?  I asked my mom.  Yes, you're...  And?  Did she tell you about when she had them?  Yeah, she was there.  No, she didn't say she had them, but she was able to identify them rather quickly.  Oh, yeah, your mom and Florence Henderson were fucking the mayor.  Yeah, I know what these are, son.  No problem. 
[01:56:30]  Matter of fact, you got the shampoo right here.  Yeah, exactly.  It's in the cupboard.  All right, thanks, Dave.  Yeah.  Well, listen, we got a bunch of guests coming up.  Brittany Andrews and then Levi Johnson.  Her person is here.  All right.  I don't think she is.  Laney?  Laney.  Okay.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll come back in a couple minutes.  I did want to, we were just putting things together because Kenny just left to go to  the courthouse.  Yes.  Because as we talked about in depth yesterday, we talked about it at the beginning of the  show, Sandy Kane is suing Opie and Anthony. 
[01:57:00]  And that's why Opie and Anthony aren't here and Jim and me and everybody else is.  Yes, jam in the morning.  Yeah, jam in the morning.  And we're jamming in the morning.  And Troy did this.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  To Auto Gate.  So we'll be covering that all morning long. 
[01:57:30]  He also, just because I guess he heard us talking, wanted to make us happy.  And I think he sees the future of this show, Jim.  This is a future of radio.  And this is what he heard.  Get up, folks.  It's Jim and Sam on The Morning Jam.  And we'll be right back with more.  I like it.  Of The Morning Jam.  Stay tuned.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, call us. 
[01:58:00]  Call us.  866-866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Smartphone users, send your feedback to feedback at opiananthony.com.  Hi there.  This is Troy, phone screener for The Opie and Anthony Show, here to help you with a helpful tip.  When calling into the radio show, it's a good idea that you turn your radio down.  O&A, what's your name?  Where are you calling from?  Yeah, make sure Opie knows that he don't know shit from shit.  Turn your radio down. 
[01:58:30]  I can't hear you.  Am I on the air?  Hey, asshole!  Am I live right now?  Hey, turn your radio down!  Hey, you!  Turn your radio down!  All right, thanks, man.  Punch it out.  See?  Wasn't that easy.  It gets you on the air faster and it makes you a better caller.  Oh, and if you want to call the show, just look down at your radio.  Yeah, right there.  Take your eyes off the road and look down.  See the number?  Just call 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Thank you, and have a nice day. 
[01:59:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What's going on?  You got the production wrong.  I mean, I guess this is the Opie and Anthony Show, but Jim, I mean, I didn't know if they  wanted it brought to air, but you brought to air that O&A are no longer with us.  Yeah, and I think the fact that we've immediately changed the name of the show is very important. 
[01:59:30]  I think you should, yeah.  Okay, I'll bring it back the way it should be brought back.  Eric, if we could bring down the music.  As you know, Opie and Anthony died last night.  Mutually masturbating.  Mutually masturbating each other in a car with the radio loud like in Casino.  Yeah.  Because they leave the car on when they do it.  As Danny said, it was a case of edging gone too far.  Yeah.  Anthony was found with his face against the window and his hands in the whoa, whoa, whoa pose.  Right?  Oh, it was too much.  Too much. 
[02:00:00]  They should have had a safe word.  But this is your new morning experience.  The Morning Jam with Jim and Sam.  It's about time we added a little personality to this show.  Am I right, Jim?  Attaboy, Sam.  I just got an amazing text.  What's that?  I had a patient with crabs in the eyelids.  Oh!  The medical term for crabs is pediculosis. 
[02:00:30]  Of course.  Pediculosis.  It's kind of like ridiculous, but with crabs in your eyes.  Look at Steve.  Dr. Steve, of course.  His show is on Saturdays at 10 Eastern.  Weird medicine.  As much as we talk about Dr. Steve, he barely gets a plug in.  I know.  We should plug him a lot more.  We should never plug his show.  But my own theory is that that's because you guys don't remember when his show is on.  I don't.  I never think about it.  I probably wouldn't remember if I wasn't here on Saturdays when Dr. Steve's show would be on.  But we do have Brittany Andrews coming in soon. 
[02:01:00]  She's on her way to the building.  Oh, is she?  Okay, good.  Yeah, she's not here yet.  And then we have – we thought we were going to have more time with her, but she's late.  Yeah, because Levi Johnston's coming in at 9.  Yeah.  I mean, unless she just wants to sit – I mean, we're going to talk to – we're going to ignore her if she stays in here.  For a little while at least.  But he might only have until 9.30.  Then we can talk to her again after if she wanted, if it goes good.  And I think Kristen Davis is going to be with her.  I like Kristen.  I haven't seen her in a while.  That's the madam from New York, or the ex-madam.  I don't know what she called herself. 
[02:01:30]  She ran for New York governor.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was in the debates with Jimmy McMillan.  The rent is too damn high.  That's right.  The rent is too damn high.  She was trying to go for that ridiculous ticket like, oh, my God, there's a madam running.  And Jimmy McMillan just came and stole all of her thunder.  Yeah, he really did fucking – it was hard to ignore a black guy talking in cadence with white hair like that.  You could not pay attention to him.  What did his beard look like?  Some historical figure.  Frederick Douglass.  Frederick Douglass, yeah. 
[02:02:00]  But no one thinks about him anymore.  No.  Then that's – look, that's the viral video age that we live in.  Jimmy McMillan was a viral star, and now it doesn't matter that we got photos with him, does it?  He's got this guy in that photo.  People will be like, who's that?  Yeah.  No one cares.  Remember?  Rent is too damn high?  No.  No, I don't remember.  With his dumb gloves.  He was a martial artist.  Was he?  Yeah, he was an interesting guy.  He was either a martial artist or a liar.  You didn't –  It was one of the two.  Yeah, one of the two.  You can never be positive. 
[02:02:30]  But Kristen kind of turns me on.  You like her?  I should say kind of.  She turns me on.  Very much so.  Yeah.  She does.  She's very sexy.  Well, then –  Randy Andrews I love.  Yeah.  Well, they're both going to be here.  And I noticed during the commercial break you informed Travis that he'd be shooed off of his seat.  Well, I requested.  Because we had some girls coming in.  If you have two people in, you always want to have them at the console.  I don't like having them behind us because we – you know.  What if we sandwich you and we put one of the girls in an aunt's seat?  I know that's sort of an in-memoriam seat right now after the edging incident gone wrong. 
[02:03:00]  And I would sit where aunt sits, but I'm just comfortable being here and talking to them on my right.  I mean, that's just where – it's like when I would get escorts.  Prostitutes, I would always get them on the right side of the car.  They would have to lean in.  Well, you explain that to them when they get here.  See, I was going to sit you on the other side, but it's like escorts.  I feel more comfortable with you here.  Yeah.  So, well, hopefully Roland will be on top of it today, I'm sure.  But I guess Bernie Andrews is now creator, producer, and director.  It's amazing when these porn stars just – 
[02:03:30]  Branch out.  Branch out is the word.  She's been called one of the top three females in the adult industry by Entertainment – well, by Entertainment Tonight.  Did they really?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  I never – I didn't realize Entertainment Tonight was ranking porno stars.  I didn't either.  I haven't watched in a long time, so I don't know if the format of the show has changed at all.  She is a pretty legendary performer.  Yeah.  I would like to have sex with her.  You would.  But I don't see that happening.  All right.  Let me just write that down.  Question one.  This is Jim Norton.  Would you possibly have sex with Jim? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  That should be followed.  Would you possibly have sex with Jim?  Yeah.  I don't know what she's promoting, actually.  Yeah.  All I'm seeing is producer, director.  Porn star DJ Miss B.  Her bio.  Oh, okay.  Oh, here it is.  So she's got a Twitter, a Facebook.  Oh, good.  We'll promote her MySpace.  I'm glad that's on the...  MySpace?  Where do you see this?  Brittany Andrews Plugs.  Where is that?  I don't have that.  Oh, thank you.  I do.  Yes, I do.  I was panicking.  She's got her Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace that she's promoting. 
[02:04:30]  Club Brittany, famous, Brittany.com.  Oh, I like that.  Exquisite feet?  Does she have nice feet?  I would love to find out.  Do you like feet?  I mean, no, not specifically.  Have you ever stuck your girl's toes?  No, but I would, but I haven't.  I don't have a specific thing for it, but I'm not grossed out by feet either.  Yeah, I'm not a big...  I'll suck...  I kind of like feet if they smell a little bit.  Yeah, but you like body odor.  Sometimes.  Like a little bit of female musk.  A little bit of stink.  If it's really bad, I can't deal with it, but I do like a little bit of it. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  You know, um...  Like you don't want, like, for somebody to be sitting next...  Well, what if they're sitting next to you, and there is a hint of body odor?  That can turn me on.  I don't want them to smell like Tippy Tom, but I mean, they give me a fucking...  Shit in their pants.  Yeah, exactly.  Just fetid, rotting flesh.  But I like a little bit of a stink.  Like if you're eating dinner, and you're just hanging out, and there's a little...  From a girl?  A little whiff, yeah.  Yeah, it could turn me on.  You like that.  Not from a guy, though?  No, never.  No, I don't want to smell a man.  I don't want to smell a man's cologne, much less his fucking body odor. 
[02:05:30]  I guess Miss Brittany Andrews is a DJ, too.  Yeah, I thought that's what she was promoting, but I guess not.  She's a major mover and shaker in the international DJ club scene.  Who's bigger, DJ Miss B or DJ Troy Kwan?  Hmm, I don't know.  I think I have a better shot at fucking DJ Troy Kwan.  Right now, I think you might.  Do we have any update on where she is?  No.  Still on her way?  Because we're literally... 
[02:06:00]  Because Levi's supposed to be coming in at nine, and he is coming in at nine.  Like, we're not going to push him back.  No, no, we can't.  Because this is...  Levi's the whole reason you came in, pretty much, right?  Yeah, because he's only in New York today, I believe.  Roger Roland said, watch, we should watch.  He goes, no, no, I'm here for a month.  I moved here.  Yeah, I live here.  What are you talking about?  Oh, I see a couple blondes walking up the hallway.  If it's a couple, then she's here.  It's a couple.  All right.  Okay, good.  Oh, one of them was Eric.  I was...  Yes. 
[02:06:30]  Roland...  So that was both of them.  Roland's...  Roland's been making fun of Eric's dyed hair, and saying, don't worry about Eric, he's  a blonde.  He'll forget.  Just accusing Eric of having blonde moments.  Hey, um...  Oh, yeah, you filmed a lovely birthday.  Yeah, I get the tripod.  Yeah.  I'm multitasking.  That's what I call myself.  Very clever.  Here they are.  Welcome to the show, ladies.  Where do I sit?  Right next to Mr. Norton.  Hey there, gentlemen.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  Thank you for having us on this morning. 
[02:07:00]  Did you have traffic?  Yes.  Are you staying in New York?  I live in New York now.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Oh.  I did your guys' show like...  Was I here, though?  Yeah, you were.  Okay.  When was it?  When was that?  I wasn't here.  You guys are.  We're live now.  We're actually on.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  People make...  Can I say anything?  You can.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, it kind of reminds me, like, you know, when you've been a porn star as long as I have,  like, I have to have sex with people at least three times to remember who the hell  they are.  Oh, really?  In 20 years of being in the business, you're like, did I have sex with you? 
[02:07:30]  And the other person's like, I'm not sure.  Did we?  It's like, let me see your penis.  Yes, maybe I might be able to remember, you know.  I find the same for the right tranny.  You know what?  Me, too.  I happen to be a bit of a tranny lover.  Oh, my God.  I've just met my wife.  Wow.  Hey.  No, I'm serious.  You know, it's...  I kind of...  I do the DJ thing now.  Porn star DJ, Miss B, which is why we're here today, to promote our event.  But, yeah, so I'm known to be a strap-on queen as well.  I actually brought my penis with me today. 
[02:08:00]  What a trupper test.  And it's one of those things I always say to guys.  I'm like, you know what?  At the end of the day, my breasts are made out of silicone, and so is my penis.  So, if you can suck my tits, you can suck my dick.  So, that's how I kind of feel.  You're preaching to the choir.  Do you meet guys that haven't had that experience, but they're willing to take a strap-on from you?  You know what?  At the end of the day, I have date-rape drugs.  I really don't care.  It doesn't matter whether they say, gotcha.  Okay.  I kind of like that.  I like a girl who's willing to fuck you in the ass and drug you.  Exactly, right? 
[02:08:30]  If Brittany Andrews date-raped you, would you consider it date-rape, or would you not consider  you're something lucky?  Would you go to the police and tell on me?  Like, what are the cops really going to say, right?  Like, oh, a porn star raped me.  It's like, dude, go home.  Yeah.  I'd go on Twitter and talk about it, how great it was.  I woke up with cum all over me, and it was mine.  Hey, now.  So, have you fucked trannies or no?  Oh, yeah, most definitely.  Being that I have the whole strap-on penis dealio, quite often, yeah, exactly, quite often 
[02:09:00]  when I'm with a gentleman, I'm always trying to take it to the next level.  Right.  So, I'm like, okay, if you suck my dick, let's say you suck a real one, baby.  So, now, what was a...  By the way, Brittany is what you call it in this conversation right now.  So, Kristen's like, you know, it's supposed to give a clean here, girlfriend.  Sorry.  It always goes straight to my penis.  No, Brittany's a good egg.  So, wait.  Now, what trannies have you slept with that are in the business?  Not that I've seen any of their movies, but just from...  Not that you know any of them.  No.  Come on.  People out there have no idea what you're talking about, and you're like, yeah, I know 
[02:09:30]  a lot of trannies in the business.  Who have you slept with?  Because I...  Well, you know, quite often, usually it's, you know, like sex, drugs, and rock and roll in the  middle of the night.  You know, hit up euros.com or something and get just, you know, your local hooker.  Is that some Jennifer Paris or somebody?  Just some local tranny hooker.  Whatever shows up at, like, 5 a.m. in the morning when you're, like, totally wasted.  Like, hey, it's Venus.  Woo-hoo.  You guys really do have a lot in common.  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  I don't drink.  He likes trannies. 
[02:10:00]  She likes trannies.  Is that a funny movie?  Hold on.  Yeah.  It's all good.  You do a lot of fetish stuff, too, right?  Yeah, I do.  You know, I used to own a dungeon for, like, 10 years in L.A.  I had a 5,000-square-foot studio, and one of the portions of the studio was my dungeon.  And it's one of those things of, like, where I had that dungeon for 10 years, and I had  this feeling that the day that I no longer had it, I would really miss it.  And I'm right.  I do miss my dungeon.  How many doms did you have working for you? 
[02:10:30]  You know what?  Primarily, it was a studio for photo and film, so, like, it was mostly just for shooting  videos.  But, you know, I did rape a proper amount of asses on my discipline horse.  And, you know, I remember one of my favorite scenes, I was like, I had these two young girls,  and they had never seen, you know, a girl truly peg the hell out of a guy's ass.  And so they asked if they could, you know, be, you know, voyeurs and watch the scene.  And I was like, yeah, go ahead, you know, take a seat.  And, I mean, it was so hilarious, because the discipline horse in the middle of the 
[02:11:00]  scene, like, broke.  But I did not lose my rhythm at all.  I just dropped to the floor and just kept going, man.  That's one of my favorite movies.  Kind of like Apocalypse Now, but with a dick in the ass and a horse breaking.  The way it should have been.  Oh, my.  Let's stay away from the bestiality.  No, I meant the, what's it called?  The thing?  The discipline horse.  That's what I mean, the horse.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Oh, yeah, I just took a little bit.  Sorry, my mind just goes and wrong. 
[02:11:30]  I'm still half asleep.  No, you don't understand.  We've been working really hard on our event that we're doing, which is the Players Ball  this Friday.  And like I said, I DJ now.  Porn star DJ must be.  So I was working on my set last night kind of late.  What is the Players Ball?  The Players Ball is where everybody dresses up like pimps and hows.  And so me and Kristen decided to get together because, you know, we are the number one players  here in New York City.  And we're going to do a ball and just celebrate, you know, all the pimps and hows in New York. 
[02:12:00]  Are you guys?  It's my birthday.  It is also a birthday party.  And it's her birthday.  We were going to bring a birthday cake today, but somehow it didn't come together.  This is my muscle sorority diet plan.  Exactly.  I'm on a cleanse right now, too.  Are you on MetaFast like Bob Kelly?  No.  A fucking dumbbell has food being delivered, too.  That's funny.  Now, I'm like doing no drug, sex, or alcohol.  I've had nothing but fruits and veggies.  I'm on like day 25 now.  And I was really good the first couple of weeks where it's usually the opposite way, 
[02:12:30]  like where in the beginning you're really frustrated.  Right.  I'm the exact opposite.  I'm like so over it right now.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Last year I made it to 28 days.  Of only fruits and vegetables?  Yeah, primarily just fruits and vegetables, like soups and juices.  I got a Vitamix, so I just throw everything in.  I made something really gross.  Like in the beginning it was like fun and interesting to throw shit in there  and just eat whatever comes out.  Like now it's just like, okay, this is really gross.  I'm really over it.  But how is that a cleanse?  It just makes you shit more?  You don't need to take any fiber. 
[02:13:00]  I will say that.  Really?  But no, I mean it's kind of like the Gershon miracle.  So, I mean, it's just like not eating any processed foods,  everything that's just from the ground,  and just being a really good girl.  I'm like doing a bachelor party tonight,  I can't drink any alcohol.  What do you do at a bachelor party?  Just dance?  Or do you do like a show with a girl?  No, it's for my girlfriend.  So it's a bachelorette party.  So I got like a male stripper coming.  We're going to a restaurant.  We're doing, it's going to be fun.  Just rape the groom maybe? 
[02:13:30]  That's a great bachelor party.  I don't think so.  You're being raped?  Just sodomize the groom?  I might rape the stripper.  Like he's pretty hot.  Like hello.  Is he gay?  I asked him specifically not to send me a gay guy, so.  A lot of them are gay, right?  But you know what?  At the end of the day, I have a penis,  so whatever, bend over piatch.  Yeah, I guess so.  That's the advantage of being a girl who has a strap on.  You love raping people.  It's pretty much a win-win for you.  It works for me.  You know, I'm happy.  I can totally bust a nut from it, so.  Can you come from somebody sucking a strap on? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, I totally can, hardcore.  But you need, is there like a.  Like more so than almost getting the twaté licked.  Really?  Yeah.  So you like the whole humiliation aspect of it?  Yeah, I love men with small penises.  Do you?  Yeah.  Wow, fucking, you just walked into heaven.  It's all we have around here.  Yeah, there's nothing but small dicks.  So what are you doing for your birthday, Kristen?  I'm here.  I'm here and promoting this event.  So that's what I'm doing.  Where is the event?  Yeah, can you tell us where the event is at?  Because I never remember the address.  It's at Hotel Chantel, which is at 92 Ludlow off of Rivington. 
[02:14:30]  It starts at 9, which is officially the media event from 9 to 10.  And then we will be continuing the after party, which is the player's ball from 10 to 4.  Is Dennis Hoff going on that from the Buddy Ranch or no?  No.  You never know who might show up.  We've got a lot of celebrity pimps and hoes that are coming.  A lot of porn stars.  A bunch of porn stars.  Yeah, we've got two limos.  So we're going to be coming in proper.  So yeah, we've got like a Lexus Ford.  We've got Natasha Star that's coming in. 
[02:15:00]  We've got Kendall Brooks, a Playboy model.  We've got a bunch of girls.  We've got 15 girls that are going to be.  And see, and I asked you to come with me.  Yeah, are you guys going to come?  Oh, you did invite me.  I asked you to be my date.  That you did.  What is it tomorrow, right?  That it's tomorrow.  And you're like, I have to work.  I am working.  You know what?  Because we're hoping to do this again.  And like maybe do like a costume contest.  So maybe you guys could come and like emcee it with me.  Oh.  Like the best pimp and ho costume in all of New York City. 
[02:15:30]  Would you come in that like a leather collar?  Yeah.  I would dress up like, I'm not really a sub.  I like being humiliated, but I wouldn't consider myself a sub.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But wait, what do you have under the strap on to make you come?  Do you have like a vibrated thing?  I don't need anything.  It's one of those things if like I'm a very vaginally orgasmic woman.  So I mean, like I come when I'm sleeping.  I mean, the, the, the twaté, it, you know, it contracts, expands, contracts, expands.  Are you doing Kegels in your sleep?  I totally do. 
[02:16:00]  Hardcore.  I mean, but it's just my mind is connected to the twaté and I don't have to think about  it.  It just does it.  So I don't need anything inside of the twaté in order to bust it out.  So, I mean, and it just really stimulates my mind, which stimulates the twaté.  Can you have, can you come from having sex, actual intercourse?  Oh, hardcore.  Or I can, you know, all night long.  I can ruin that.  30 to 50.  You can ruin that.  I beg to differ.  Oh, you know what?  This is one of the favorite ways I love to humiliate men is if their penis is too small  or they can't, you know, fuck me. 
[02:16:30]  I make them put on a strap on.  Oh, I love it.  Now, Jim has said before.  Sorry, I cracked myself up.  It is really hot, actually, because it's so humiliating.  It's like, your penis is so useless that you need to put a proper cock on.  Jim likes has said that he likes sometimes when he's fucking a girl.  Uh-huh.  If she brings up men that she's fucked.  Oh, cuckold.  Yeah.  I love cuckold.  Oh, I'm not even going to start going there, because it is way too early to get that dirty,  nasty, and disgusting.  No, it's not. 
[02:17:00]  We've been here for a while, so it's late in the morning for us.  Last night, yeah.  I mean, I like the cuckold.  I don't know if I could watch it, but I like talking about it.  It's one of those things where it's a better played fantasy than maybe doing it in real  life.  Yeah, because you don't want to see that.  You don't want to watch your woman get fucked really well by someone, and then all of a  But, you know, like, I was going to get even more, yeah, like, because if I'm going  to do that, and if it's going to be in person, I'm going to make sure that you're truly,  really humiliated.  Yeah, and yeah.  Why do it half-assed?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, she's the best.  I wish, she said how much she likes small dicks. 
[02:17:30]  I wish we had Bobo in here just to show her.  That would have been, we have a guy.  He's got a really small penis.  He has the smallest penis you've ever seen.  Oh my God, you know what?  I actually ended up having sex with a virgin midget in a taxi cab in the middle of Times  Square ages ago.  How?  Yeah, how?  You said I ended up.  Did you plan on it, or were you sharing a cab?  Where did you find a virgin midget?  Like, where?  He was a fan of mine.  It was for a film that I was doing, and yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, it was one of those things.  It was really kind of strange.  I mean, but it was like a tampon.  I really couldn't feel it.  But, I mean, the guy was really sweet and nice, and however, now, like, ever since I've  done that, I've got all these weird, strange virgins for, like, the last 15 years that  all want me to, like, de-virginize them.  But will you tell a guy, if you're fucking, that other guys have fucked you better?  If they're into humiliation, then yeah.  That's hot.  What type of stuff would you say?  Just curious.  Oh, let me see her.  She's charging for the hour right now.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:18:30]  That's very sexy.  I just want to throw that out there.  Do you think so?  Kristen, get my money, man.  I have to point out the economic value of this conversation.  Former madam.  Yeah, exactly.  Former madam.  She's like, yeah, you're going to have to pay me first, though.  That's what she used to do.  Used to.  Used to do.  Now she's running for governor.  Yeah, she is.  Yay, for legalizing, prostitution, marijuana.  And cuckolding.  And cuckolding.  And cuckolding.  How would you humiliate a guy if you were humiliating him?  What would you say, like, I know I'd probably take it, like, one step too far and just say  something a little too harsh that wasn't sexy.  You know what the best thing to do is, like, with the cuckold thing? 
[02:19:00]  Like, just have the other guy bust a nut right on you.  But, I mean, if the guy isn't.  Or, like, you know what my favorite things is, is the bust a nut on the feet and then  make you suck it off my toes.  See, I can't.  I've had girls want me to lick.  I lick my own cum up on video once for a girl, like, out of my hand.  Yeah, they die.  And, um.  I love that.  You see the smile on my face?  I do.  Like, I love that.  I have a photo of my hand with cum in it.  It's really important.  It looks like I'm an unlucky beggar.  Bragging about your photos.  It's cum in your hand.  One of my favorite things is to do that with the toes. 
[02:19:30]  However, I had a guy reverse snowball me once.  Oh, wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  Right?  Am I this bad?  That's a football term.  It's the only dealt in, like, vanilla, vanilla.  So what the heck is a snowball?  Okay, so a snowball is typically when a girl, when a guy busts a nut in a girl's mouth,  she comes back as a sign of revenge and spits it back in.  So this guy had him do it off my toes.  And he waited, like, I don't know, like, three minutes, gave me a kiss, and right back  out.  And I was like, oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  So he just washed it around in his mouth for three minutes?  He was like, here's to you.  Hope he didn't have tartar breath.  That'd be awful.  Yeah.  Cum and tartar.  Ew.  I can't eat garlic.  I don't want to do Zylan at all for the teeth by Trident.  I don't want to.  Oh, yeah.  I always chew things with no aspartame.  I, um.  Fuck Trident.  Don't go with Trident.  Go with, uh.  They got Zylan at all, though.  It's good for your teeth.  No, there's better ones, though.  There's vegan gums.  I'll turn into some vegan gums.  Um, you promised a cuckold man.  I'll get you some vegan bubble gum.  I got a big black crack for you, baby.  We were talking about cuckolding and taking cocks and stuff. 
[02:20:30]  I'm glad that you brought it back to vegan gum.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like, I was trying to bring up her running for governor.  She's like, okay, I'm not doing any more radio programs with Brittany ever again.  They mentioned that earlier.  They were very nice.  Jimmy was very nice to say that he likes Kristen Davis, which was nice.  I do.  I was actually with her, with you last year when we were accounting.  But then you had to degrade it by saying I was in the debates with Jimmy McMillan.  Why can't we say we were in the debates with Andrew Cuomo?  Well, he said that.  Well, I, we had Jimmy on the show, so it was just a point of reference for the listeners. 
[02:21:00]  He did a good job.  I thought that he, like, I thought there would have been a lot of press for you as, like,  an unconventional candidate had Jimmy McMillan not been there stealing all your heat.  Well, the real press, like the Washington Post said I was their favorite fringe candidate.  Right.  The L.A. Times, I'm the only one out of the debates that made the L.A. Times.  So there were, there was a lot of real press.  He got the novelty votes in the novelty press, yes, which we were both running to create a  new political party, which is $50,000.  What was his theme last year?  The rent is too damn high.  Oh, yeah.  But he didn't even pay any rent. 
[02:21:30]  You're right.  Like, come on now, your rent is the perfect rent.  He's a fraud.  Yeah, exactly right.  Yeah, he didn't pay a lot of rent.  No.  And especially if somebody was telling him how, like, other people they've had sex with  were better fucks.  He's always got to come back to that.  He didn't even bring that up.  By the way, you say that.  You talk about that a lot, right?  Oh, no, he did bring that up.  I do.  No, Jimmy, he did bring that up because I asked him about it.  And he said that he had had sex with girls in front of their husbands.  Oh, that's right.  He did say that.  He did say that.  Yes, he did.  We didn't have sex with him.  We have two gubernatorial candidates talking about cuckolding.  We are the show.  For cuckolding. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Hand in hand, man.  Britney's fantastic.  I met you once at AVN years ago, very, very briefly.  We've never spoken before.  I'm pretty sure that you were here the last time I did the show, though.  Because, you know, I think I was here when, do you guys remember Porno Dan?  Porno Dan.  No.  The name is familiar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The name is familiar.  And I think I was, like, doing something with him.  He was in D.C.  And we came by.  But, yeah, you know, I come to this building all the time.  I was just, actually, it's funny because I'm going to be doing a DJ set on the DJ Woo 
[02:22:30]  Kid show.  Oh, who kid?  Who's a friend of the show?  Yeah, exactly.  I'm going to be wearing my strap on.  And I'm going to be DJing.  And I'm going to have two girls sucking my cock.  So it's going to be, like, a DJ orgy.  Who kid is the greatest?  Like, how do we make that happen?  Yeah, you guys got to, like, come and visit.  We can, like, cross-pollinate or something.  Who kid, like, you know how we kind of have to bring girls in and try to figure out how  to get them to take their clothes off or whatever?  Who kid does something called the naked interview, where he just has girls come in and he'll interview  them, but they're naked.  Well, it was so funny because he has better, he's got game than you have done. 
[02:23:00]  Much better game than you have done.  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  But no, actually, it was so funny because I went in there and they were all giving, I  said something about penis.  And they're like, bitch, we only got cocks up here.  So, like, while they're, like, doing their thing, like, I put my strap on, I don't say  anything.  And then, like, they turn around, they're like, what the fuck?  I'm like, biatch, it's a pink penis.  It matches my pussy.  Let me tell you something.  Do you want to see my pink penis?  Should I put it on?  Do you want to?  What?  What? 
[02:23:30]  We might have an issue with that.  We have a time issue because you're late.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Can you hang out a little bit?  Yeah, I can hang out.  We have to, uh...  I can rock out with my kiaki out.  We have, uh...  Levi Johnston.  Is he here or no?  Yeah, he's here.  Okay.  So I was thinking, can you guys hang out?  We'll talk...  Because Levi will only be in here for 15, 20 minutes.  Yeah, I'm cool.  I don't know about her, but I'm totally fine.  Are you cool, Kristen?  Oh, I'm cool.  I'm always cool.  All right, good.  So hang in.  And the big event is tomorrow night, Friday night.  Um...  Hotel Chantel.  92 Ludlow off of Rivington. 
[02:24:00]  And you're still...  If you want to come by after your show or whatever...  Okay, maybe I will.  Yeah, I would like to.  We'll be pimping and howling.  I'll save you, you know, a tonic and water.  Whatever you...  Exactly.  I'm going to be cleansing still, so...  Oh, good.  So I'll have a pineapple juice with you, dude.  All right, and I'll bring you some vegan gum.  Hey!  Some fair trade that he's already trying to establish.  He's going to come up the hall now.  Okay, Levi Johnston coming up in just a second.  Do you want a break?  A one-minute break, yeah.  Okay, we'll do a single.  All right.  All right.  The Virus. 
[02:24:30]  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  Now you are.  We are back, and Levi Johnston has just come into the studio.  How are you, man?  I'm good.  How are you?  Good, good, good.  Do you like or hate morning press?  No, it's all right.  Let's make sure we got you up here.  Okay, when did you get into New York?  What am I doing here?  No, no, when did you get in?  Oh, I got in on Sunday.  How long are you staying?  Until tomorrow.  Okay. 
[02:25:00]  I was telling you, we met very briefly in the hallway.  Uh-huh.  And it's weird.  We get a book usually the night before, so we don't have time to really read it.  But I got this a few days ago.  So, and I guess I got 200 pages in, like, of actually really reading it.  And the last 90, I perused and just picked up notes.  It's fucking great.  Yeah, thank you.  Your book is really good.  Well, it's also like, and I was telling you this before, it's almost, for a lot of people,  this is like the dream book because everybody at some point has wanted to write a book about  their ex-girlfriend's family and how they were treated. 
[02:25:30]  There is no guide.  It's a beautiful thing.  It's like, but nobody would have interest in reading it, but yours happens to be the Palin,  and so people do want to read that.  Right, so people care.  Like, I would love to trash every family of every fucking extra-girlfriend I have who  hated me.  How long into it?  And you really, she's not going to be happy with this.  Probably not, no, no.  No?  What would you say about stuff you've said in the past and in interviews?  Are they comfortable with you revealing stuff, or they hate that?  Oh, I'm sure they don't like it, you know, but the book is the truth, and I'm glad it's 
[02:26:00]  done.  You know, I think we did a good thing with it.  Do you feel you've been treated?  I have a bunch of questions written down.  One thing I want to say that I like.  You don't need to announce that you have a bunch of questions written down.  But I have to, because I'm a stand-up, so as a comic, you know, you have to be honest  with people.  Address everything.  You have to.  So if I'm ever in front of an audience, and I'm trying a new joke, and I actually have a  fucking piece of paper, I'll go, look, I'm just going to read this, and I'll tell  them.  I can't lie.  Is that noise going to stop?  No.  Yeah, yeah, it's done.  So in the opening of the book, you talk about this birthday party you're going to in Vegas 
[02:26:30]  with your manager, and you said, yeah, he and I had both gotten another 15 minutes of  fame.  And I kind of like that you said, like, how do you see your fame or notoriety?  Do you see it as something that's going to be fleeting, or something that's going to  stick around for a while?  I'm sure, you know, I'm sure it's gotten into it, but, you know, when that happens, I have  no idea.  I mean, things keep coming, and, you know, I mean, I'm getting more calls now.  I'm getting more calls now than I ever have, so, you know, it's going good.  What are they calling you for?  Is it for acting work, or?  It's reality shows to, you know, commercials to music videos, everything, you know, and 
[02:27:00]  it's, I've got a lot of stuff, too, that, you know, from pornos to everything, I mean,  there's, everything's out there.  Well, it's funny, like, do you resent when they're calling you, because do they want  you to do things that are going to make Sarah Palin look bad, or has it gotten to a point  where they kind of just like you just being yourself?  It's getting more to that point, yeah.  I mean, a lot of it is still, they want dirt on the Palins, and they want all that,  but, you know, it's, after this book, you know, that's a direction I don't want to go  anymore, so, you know, we're going to start picking what I do, you know, a little 
[02:27:30]  differently.  Do you, do you regret doing Playgirl?  No, no, I, you know, that's, that's something I chose to do, I was, I was young, and, you  know, I learned a lot from it, and it was a, it was a hell of an experience.  50 grand?  I mean, how do you say no?  And you didn't do full frontal.  I don't, I don't, let me, I'm not saying that in a disappointed fashion.  It came out really bad.  What are you thinking?  Yeah, come on, why?  What about the fans?  Did they want you to do full frontal and you said no, or did they not want to do it? 
[02:28:00]  No, they definitely wanted me to do it, but, you know, I probably don't  promise mama wouldn't do it, and that's not something, that's not something I wanted  to do.  Oh, okay.  And this is what, I was amazed, I read this, you got offered, you took $50,000 to do that,  but you did show some restraint.  Could you tell people what they offered you $300,000 to do?  Who's this, Playgirl?  No, no, no, the videos you got offered to make, the three videos, it was $100,000 for  three, it was, I'm sorry, $100,000 for three masturbation scenes.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:28:30]  Um, yeah, I heard one that, uh, you know, I had the, yeah, the masturbate in front of  the cameras and a couple other things like that, and then, uh, do a, do a porno with  the Sarah Palin lookalike, you know, I've got a lot, I've got a lot of stuff like that.  Well, there is a porno with her.  Yeah.  Nailin Palin, I think is what he's called.  Oh, yeah.  He's seen it.  Have you seen it?  No, I'm talking about, oh, yeah, I do my research.  Now, would that creep you out to do that?  Oh, no, that's, that's, uh, no, not gonna happen.  You wouldn't do that even for the right, you know?  No, no, no, I guess that's taking it a little bit too far. 
[02:29:00]  That's crossing the line, yeah, I don't, I don't think, uh, my family would ever forgive  me for that one.  Oh, that's family, okay.  Do you find it hard, um, you know, like, when people are talking to you, and I mean in real  life, not in an interview, to judge what their motives are, like, like, do you, it's hard  to figure out if they really like you and are getting to know you, or if they're only trying  to get you to say something that they can run out and blog or run out and talk about?  Definitely, definitely, you know, I mean, it goes to as far as my friends, you know,  I've lost, I've lost a bunch of them, you know, I don't, you don't know who you can  trust anymore, and, you know, every, everything you do is, like, under a microscope, and everybody's 
[02:29:30]  watching you, you know?  Yeah.  It's tough.  What point did you realize, too, because this, like, you're a regular dude, and I'm reading  this book, and you grew up in Alaska, you like to hunt and fish and just do things that  regular dudes there do.  You hook up with a girl, her mom was, what, the mayor, I think, when you met?  Mm-hmm, yeah.  Which is, you know, it's a small town she's a mayor in, and then a couple of years later,  she's almost the president of the United States.  What was the first thing that happened that you realized, like, fuck, I am, everything  I say now matters?  Well, she started, you know, mayor to governor.  That was a pretty big deal in Alaska, and then, you know, when I got thrown on that private 
[02:30:00]  jet all the way down to the RNC, you know, that's when it really started hitting me, you  know?  Now, that was when it was going to be announced that she was McCain's running mate.  Yep, well, she had already announced it, yeah, now we're going down for the speeches  and all that, all the good stuff.  Oh, yeah, you said you got pulled over, like, three times to puke?  I did, yeah, on the way to Anchorage, on the way to the airport.  I was nervous, dude.  I was like, no, this is not happening.  And Bristol was pregnant by this point?  Yeah, no, she was definitely pregnant.  Did you say that, you think she did that to kind of get, to upset Sarah or to match Sarah? 
[02:30:30]  It was more, it was more of jealousy.  I mean, she, we had talked about it, and, you know, she'd always wanted a kid in Sarah.  Sarah just actually, you know, she had trig, and that really was what sparked Bristol to  get going on it.  And I was dumb enough just to roll with it.  So you were dating for a while, and I know, I don't wear bags either.  I hate wearing them.  Especially in a relationship, there's nothing worse.  And were you just kind of going on in faith that she was taking birth control?  Oh, yeah, I was just kind of going, you know, if it happens, it happens. 
[02:31:00]  Not thinking at all.  Not thinking at all.  Just like, whatever.  Yeah, at 17, who's thinking, right?  Right.  Yeah, I guess it's not going to happen to me.  Yeah.  Oh, you didn't, you actually were like, I hope she's taking it, but if she's not, oh, well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to get mine.  But I would freak out about that, and I'm 43.  I mean, I look younger.  I appreciate that.  But I mean, I'm 43, and it's like, it still terrifies me to knock a girl up.  But, you know, here you are at 18, you got a girl pregnant, or 17, and you fucking handle  it like, oh, I just got to get a good job.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we were dating for a long time. 
[02:31:30]  We were in love, and, you know, that was always the plan.  It just happened earlier than we thought.  But that's also because Levi is a man.  Like, he hunts.  He's got an outdoors thing.  You, me, we would handle it differently because we're not men.  Yeah.  We're weasels.  I wore cologne into a radio interview because we have a porn girl, and I really am a fool.  Exactly.  Do you think, you've been kind of vilified in the press, and reading this was really interesting  to me.  The book is called Deer in the Headlights, My Life in Sarah Palin's Crosshair.  And I like the fact that you're not shying away from talking about it.  Like, a lot of people will talk about somebody, but then act like, well, that's not why I 
[02:32:00]  wrote the book.  This is why you wrote the book, was to kind of set the record straight with your relationship  with that family or what happened.  Definitely.  It was, you know, I wrote it to get my side of the story out there.  You know, everybody was sitting there talking about me as far as Palin's the press, and,  you know, everybody who doesn't know me is hating on me.  So, you know, that was a way to get my side of the story out there and the truth.  What was, do you feel you've been treated unfairly by the press?  Have they been too rough on you?  Oh, you know, definitely.  I mean, they don't know who I am.  They just, you know, come up with stories and lies, you know, just to make them a dollar. 
[02:32:30]  So, you know, that's, you know, the biggest reason I wrote this thing.  What was the first thing you can remember seeing about yourself or about your family that was  just completely untrue?  Well, I'll tell you, about the only two that really bothered me was I was a bad father.  And then, you know, one came out about my mother, how she was a druggie and a bunch of  stuff like that.  You know, they can sit there and say what they want about me all day long.  But, you know, when you start getting into my son and my family, you know, that's when  you're crossing the line because they don't know me and they don't know us. 
[02:33:00]  Your mom, I know, you talk about your mom and she had gotten arrested.  She made a bad decision.  You know, she had sold, I guess, Oxycontin or whatever.  And I thought that, did she really get like three years?  I think that was a pretty harsh sentence for something that was kind of, she's obviously not  a drug pusher.  No, she wasn't in jail for three years, you know, and I don't know the whole details of  that, so I'm not going to get into it.  But, you know, she had to do some jail time and she's on probation.  But, you know, she's handling it well.  Do you think that there was more of a target on her because she's your mom and because of 
[02:33:30]  the whole connection?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there's definitely much bigger fish out there.  You know, she apparently sold a couple pills to some kid one time and got caught and, you  know, she got in a lot of trouble.  I mean, I feel like they definitely had it in for us.  Do you think the people who had it in for you were pro-Palin and pissed off at you or  anti-Palin and wanting to embarrass her family?  No, I definitely pro-Palin, you know.  Oh, okay.  You know, everybody who dislikes Palin seems to love me and I don't think they'd want to  hurt me like that. 
[02:34:00]  It really is an odd effect she's had on the country.  Like, I think the media has made her bigger because they attack her so much that they force  people who would normally just be like, ah, she's whatever, to rally around her.  Um, it's been an odd...  Well, you have to have an opinion.  Like, they won't allow anybody to be like, whatever.  Like, you either have to hate this woman or if you don't hate her, then the people who  hate her say, well, then you love her.  But if you don't love her, then, you know, I'm just repeating myself.  Yeah, no, but you're right.  I'm kind of in the middle.  Like, I would not vote for her.  She's way too conservative.  It's funny. 
[02:34:30]  I was reading...  You said something about, uh, you had some fucking good digs in this book, man.  This is really...  I was reading...  There's a few I was like, oh, that was ballsy to put in print.  Um, do you think she'd be a good president?  Oh, no, I don't.  You know, I...  She's, um...  You know, I think a lot of America's just voting for her for her looks, you know?  And, um...  You know, she's a...  She's a governor of a small town, you know?  And to be honest, I don't think she's overqualified to...  If she run this country.  The media has...  And again, you can never completely trust the press because they're all...  They're motivated their own way. 
[02:35:00]  But they've painted her as kind of an idiot.  I mean, that's...  You know, whether it was the Katie Couric interview or they harp on mistakes she's made.  How unfair have they been?  I'm going to ask you a two-part question.  Have they been really unfair to her?  And what have they gotten right?  Um, you know, as far as her messing up in small interviews like that, you know, that's just  her not coming into it, um, you know, with her head on right.  I mean, she's...  She is an intelligent woman, um, with a lot of things.  And, um, she's achieved a lot of stuff that, uh, many women won't.  So, you know, to that point, you've really got to give her some kind of credit. 
[02:35:30]  But, uh, you know, a lot of things in her book, in Bristol's book, you know, there are a lot of  flat-out lies she's told.  What did she say about you?  Because, uh, I was reading that you said that, uh, what can you do, match her life or lie  or something?  What was something Bristol said that really bothered you, um, or that you felt was just  to cover the family's angle and she didn't care about hurting you?  Um, well, this was, um, we, you know, we got back together a second time.  We got engaged and whatnot.  And this was actually, you know, I went and apologized to the Palins, you know, Sarah and 
[02:36:00]  Todd, you know, in person.  And then, uh, apparently that wasn't good enough.  So we had to send out an apology letter and, and, uh, she had her, her lawyer writes up,  write, write something up and they actually sent it off to People Magazine without me knowing  about it, saying it was from me, you know, and, uh, you know, that, that, you know,  that, that wasn't right.  And then, you know, she's, uh, recently comes out and says she's going to find a new  father for trip and, you know, it's, it's all, she says a lot of horrible stuff.  After dealing with lawyers here, can you imagine having to deal with lawyers when you're trying  to, it's your personal life. 
[02:36:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, is that, how often do lawyers and things like that enter into your personal life?  Uh, quite a bit.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, you, they were coming after him, like, uh, with, with, with the stuff about, but  you know, it was all being funded probably by, by her mom.  And here you are, you know, you're, you're getting a working guy.  I mean, you're making decent money, but to have to pay lawyers at a family court, uh,  I guess, are you done with that legal process or no?  No, no.  The legal process is still, uh, much and running. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  I mean, we haven't went to court yet and, you know, I am going to fight for 50 50 and,  um, but that's, uh, you know, that's coming up.  And it's hard because everything they say, you have to answer whether it's true or not  true.  Uh, and they, you know, and a family that has a lot more money than you do can probably afford  to, to just keep coming at you with legal.  I think you said in the book that they just keep coming at you.  Someone said they're going to keep coming at you just until you're broke.  That's probably true.  And it helps to get you to sign something over.  Yeah, that's probably true, but, uh, that's never going to happen.  How do you address the bad father rap?  Cause I've heard that before, but obviously there's two sides. 
[02:37:30]  That's, that's, that's something that you kind of really got to, you know, I've learned  to brush it off my shoulders.  You know, the people are saying that have nothing better to do with their life.  And, uh, you know, they clearly don't know me and, you know, they really don't even know  Bristol.  Um, so they're, you know, they're just kind of running their mouth.  Yeah.  They're just, because they've heard, they hear one thing, they pick it up and they're  well, they're just, yeah.  Or they just made it up clearly, you know, they're, they don't see me with my son.  They, you know, they don't, they don't see anything.  Well, didn't you say too, that you, there were times where you wanted to see your son  and spend time with your son, but after a while it was like the baby was just with the 
[02:38:00]  palins and then you would go there and instead of spending time alone with them, they would  just be kind of sitting on the couch, staring at you while you had time with your son.  Yeah, that was, that was, you know, when he was, when he was first born within a couple  months, you know, first couple months he was born, I'd go over there and, uh, it was  like, I was just, they're all watching me, you know, like a, like a damn hawk.  But you know, now, now it's, you know, I, I see him without, without them  around.  So, you know, but, uh, that, that would you refer to as, you know, that was, that  was kind of weird.  And there's, um, I, I tell you, I actually wrote this thing down.  I just wrote the word, uh, you have, you have her painted as pretty phony in the 
[02:38:30]  book and I guess everyone's public, uh, perception is different than they are at  home to a little bit.  I mean, you have to be, I guess, in politics, but I put a few things that you  wrote, which I thought were amazing that you wrote these down.  Like you didn't, you, anybody who wants to read a book that is brutally honest from  a point of view, you don't pull any fucking punches in this at all.  And the book is called Deer in the Headlights, My Life and Sarah Palin's Crosshairs.  It's out on Amazon.  Are you doing signings or no? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, I did, uh, I did a signing in Jersey, um.  Pride bookends, right?  Yep.  Yeah, in Ridgewood.  And, uh, what are you doing in New York signing wise?  Uh, I don't think I have a signing in New York here.  Do you have anything coming up, uh, signing wise?  Uh, I have one in Anchorage on the 29th at, uh, Barnes and Noble.  Okay, well, we're on, uh, everywhere in the U.S. and Canada.  Are we on in Alaska as well?  Yeah.  Okay, well, Anchorage is on the 25th at Barnes.  I'm sure you don't know.  29th.  29th, sorry.  I'm sure the people will come see you.  Um, there's some amazing, unflattering lines.  Uh, you said something about her wanting to bring up your kid and you wrote, it was ironic 
[02:39:30]  that Sarah offered to be a mother to another child considering that she basically ignored  the one she already had.  Are you talking about when she tried to adopt mine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, that was something that, you know, it pissed brisked off and then she gave the phone to me  and I just, I just went off on her.  I mean, that's, uh, she's clearly doing that just to cover up, you know, Bristol's whole  pregnancy.  Now, do you, uh, you said she ignored the one she had.  You paint the household as kind of, uh, cold and, and distant.  It wasn't, and you said like the house you grew up in was kind of much warmer and a different 
[02:40:00]  vibe than they had.  Yeah.  No, there, uh, you know, Sarah was always gone.  Granted, she worked a lot, but, uh, you know, even when she was there, she was, uh,  on her blackberry on the couch or in her bedroom, you know?  So, I mean, uh, Sarah was definitely more of the mother to Trigg than, you know, she  was, or Bristol was.  Bristol was.  Bristol was.  Did they have, uh, did, did really the husband, uh, did Todd really sleep in the living room  while she stays in her room most of the time?  Todd, Todd, Todd's bed was, uh, the black recliner out in the middle of the living room.  And then she's up in.  Oh, she's, she's, uh, she was in her bedroom.  Yeah.  And he sleeps in the, that's weird. 
[02:40:30]  That is weird.  That'd be a very weird arrangement in the White House.  Yeah.  It's kind of creepy.  And it's funny that you said some good things about Obama too.  You seem like more of an Obama guy.  If you had to choose between the two, you seem like more of an Obama guy.  Oh yeah.  I'll probably, you know, I'll definitely vote for Obama.  Yeah.  Oh, it's not good.  Wow.  It's not good when somebody who really knows you well will vote for the other guy.  Nor, because if you knew somebody that was running for president, you would just vote  for them because you knew them.  Yeah.  I would just vote for them because I don't have pictures with them and I could say there's  me and the president.  Right.  But it's, it's, it's, there's no media spin that puts any of, like your feelings about 
[02:41:00]  her have nothing to do with the media.  It's all from your personal experience.  Right.  Yeah.  And you say here, Sarah comes off, she comes off as religious, but you're saying you never  saw them say grace and you don't think they prayed a lot.  And there was one great line after she got the nomination, she told the world that being  chosen was God's plan.  It would be the first time I had ever heard her mention the fella.  Yeah.  Um, you know, I, I really, I really haven't.  Um, she went to church on a Christmas Eve and that was, you know, that was about it. 
[02:41:30]  So this whole, this whole, um, thing with her being like religious and this kind of spiritual  thing and that being part of the religious right is not.  No, that's, that's all part of the show.  Cause that wasn't going on at the house.  It was, there was not a lot of God talk or.  No, I mean, she had a cross or two in the house and, you know, I went to church on Christmas  Eve.  That was it.  She really has a tanning bed in the house.  I don't say that's bad.  I mean, she did in Juneau at the, at the governor's mansion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of liked that actually.  The governor's mansion.  Yeah.  There's a tanning bed.  Maybe that is a little bit creepy, but you know, um, and, uh, she, her complaining, 
[02:42:00]  uh, with the baby, she wrote, uh, Oh, you, I'm sorry.  We watched her on the stump with Trigg, her accessory.  It made my stomach turn to see him displayed like a designer bag, then passed off to a nanny.  Wow.  That's a harsh, harsh line.  It is.  It is.  And I'm not saying you're wrong for writing it, but can you elaborate on that a little  bit?  You know what?  Just, you know, back home, she, like I said, she's always in her room.  She's paying no attention to him, whether it's Bristol or Piper or, you know, Todd, 
[02:42:30]  playing with Trigg, you know, um, she rarely would ever do it.  And, uh, even at the geo, you know, the GOB, I mean, she, uh, you know, everybody playing  with him.  And once it was time to walk out on stage here, boom, you know, she'd have him in his  arm.  And then when we got off, you hand him right off to Willow.  Um, you know, it was, it was pretty clear to me that she was, you know, she was kind  of using him as, you know, that's the best way I could, you know, kind of describe  it.  Yeah.  That, because, because you didn't just say like, she didn't hold him a lot.  There was the wording I thought was fucking really was great.  It was, uh, stomach turning and you see him use like a designer bag. 
[02:43:00]  That's a definite statement about, you really don't like this woman.  Oh, it's not that, you know, I don't hate her by no means, but, uh, yeah, no, I'm definitely  not fond of her.  Do you think your relationship is ruined because you do have a child with wrist?  I mean, you're going to be tied in for at least 18 years, if not more.  Is your relationship, do you think ruined or is it possible to salvage it?  Or after this, do you think it's going to be a rough ride?  Oh no, I'm sure it's going to be a rough ride and it's over.  It's going to be, do you regret it at all or no?  No, I don't.  I'm glad my side of the story's out there. 
[02:43:30]  And then, uh, you know, the truth.  Yeah.  It must be frustrating when you hear yourself being spoken about and by somebody who has  the entire media at their disposal and it's bad not being trashed on Twitter.  Yeah.  It would have been a rough ride for him regardless because if he hadn't come out with the book,  he would have just had to sit there knowing everybody just believed the Palin story and  he still has to put up with the family.  Everybody hates me and thinks I'm a bad father, you know, that's something I didn't want to  live with.  Well, here's a, here's another fucking gem.  I'm telling you, and I'm not being polite.  I fucking loved this book. 
[02:44:00]  I never ripped through 200 pages in two days.  I could not stop reading this.  It said, uh, you, you say that, uh, when she was speaking, people were baffled by her run  on sentences, uh, whenever she's talked off the cuff and you write, that's what happened  when she began a sentence and then lied halfway through it.  Is that what was tend to happen?  She would just kind of start off and, uh, Oh, she, she was good at it.  You make it up and she went, I mean, a lot of people bought it. 
[02:44:30]  Wow.  The reason, by the way, I'm taking such joy in this is I really don't have much of an  opinion on Sarah, but I really don't, I don't have a political agenda.  I love the fact that somebody is writing just really brutally honest things from their  point of view.  Like it's nice to see that you're not fucking stepping around any of it.  And she's not getting attacked for like politics or something.  Like you're saying, I spent time with this person.  I know her as a human being.  This is my character evaluation.  You don't hear that about politicians ever because nobody's, nobody gets as close and  nobody can be like, this is the truth.  It's honesty in politics for one. 
[02:45:00]  There's nothing worse by the way that when you're a politician and, and you say something  in the book, which I think is interesting too, about how you were keeping a mental, like  while they were saying stuff about you, you had all the stuff that you had seen and the  conversations you had heard.  And, uh, did you realize at one point that you were kind of stockpiling that stuff like  as ammunition in case, was there a point where you realized you might need it?  Not until I wrote the book.  I mean, you know, it all started coming back to me, but, um, you know, they, they said a  lot of nasty things about me.  And I mean, you know, Sarah pounds a lot older than I, and, uh, you know, for her to come 
[02:45:30]  attack, uh, you know, 20, you know, 18, 19, 20 year old kid is, is, uh, you know,  it seems pretty immature to me, but, um, you know, I'm glad I paid attention.  You know, I'm glad I had some, uh, some ammo to come back at her, you know, cause, uh,  she had a lot of bad things about me.  Well, there was also, you said too, and you were, you were close when you were younger.  You, uh, you guys had a real relationship.  You didn't, he didn't just walk in and all of a sudden like, Hey, she's going to be president.  Let me capitalize on it.  Like, you know, you guys actually had a warm relationship.  Yeah.  I've known them for a long time. 
[02:46:00]  You grew up with the kind of around the family.  I grew up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I played hockey at track and then I started dating Bristol, you know, when she was, you  know, uh, mayor.  So, I mean, I knew him for a long time.  And how was the relationship with her dad?  Uh, you know, we, we rode snow machines every once in a while and, you know, but, um, you  know, he didn't, he didn't talk much and come and find out he didn't like me very much either.  So maybe cause you were with his daughter.  I mean, that makes sense.  Right.  At what point did you feel the relationship change a little bit?  Um, it definitely started going downhill once, um, they lost the, uh, you know, she lost 
[02:46:30]  the vice president nominee.  How hard is it to have, like, they told you say nothing when you said that too, when you got  there to the Republican convention, they say, say nothing, don't talk.  You have all publicists and press agents and all these people just speaking and thinking  and dressing you.  Well, that was kind of easy for me.  I didn't want to talk to any of them anyway.  Oh, you didn't.  I mean, I was, I was nervous.  I mean, uh, you know, they just said, smile, wave, you know, we're going to get there,  you cut your hair, you're going to just spray tan and get your nails.  And I said, no, we're not.  They want you to get a spray tan?  Spray tan.  No, that didn't happen. 
[02:47:00]  I didn't do the nails, but I did get the haircut and I put on the Armani suits and I, I went  out there and smile and waved and, you know, I was, I was there for Bristol, but, uh, yeah,  I don't think I want to talk to any of them anyway.  Yeah.  You don't seem like a manicure.  I can see putting a nice suit on.  You don't seem like a fucking manicure spray tan guy.  I've done the spray tan for play girl, but that was, that was the last time I think I'll  do it.  Um, the pictures I saw simply for research, I have to fucking clarify.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  I don't want it to look like they're on my wall.  Um, by the way.  Um, did they, were they black and white? 
[02:47:30]  Were they, were they, were they just maybe the copies I saw?  Uh, probably just the copies you saw.  There's, there's, you know, there's colored ones.  Did the magazine sell well?  Uh, you know, actually I don't, I don't know.  It's weird too.  Cause, and you acknowledge this again.  I love the fact that you acknowledge this, that the majority of people who read play girl  are men and you're like, I don't care.  No, you know, and the, you know, it works for me, you know, I mean, uh, they're all people  to me and you know, they're all, uh, you know, whether they like, you know, guys that are,  guys or women, you know, it's, um, I'm totally fine with that. 
[02:48:00]  You didn't care if there was a bunch of guys looking as long as they paid.  That's fair enough.  That's a good way to put it.  I mean, I'm looking at him in the face.  Like, you doesn't have to watch them looking at him.  That would be, in person would probably be very uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Even 50,000 is like, eh, maybe a little more than that.  Yeah.  A little bit more than that.  Maybe for one guy.  All right.  But, uh, this was to me an amazing line.  And, uh, I think first of all, like, cause I like John McCain.  He seems like an honest fucking, he's a vet.  You know, there's things about him I like, but his age was a concern because he's an older  guy and you're talking to her and you said exactly what does the vice president do? 
[02:48:30]  Did she really smile at you and say, take over when the president dies?  Something like that.  Yes.  I mean, she, she said it whether, you know, it was a joke or not, you know, but, uh, there  was definitely something that was said.  So she was very aware of the fact that she, as they said, was one heartbeat away from,  uh, Oh, I'm, I'm, you know, I don't know what she was thinking, you know, but, um, yeah,  at the time she told me that I bet she wouldn't think I was going to put it in a book, but.  Yeah.  You probably don't say something like that and say, make sure you get that quote correct. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Make sure you get that good.  Don't paraphrase.  Yeah.  I want it to, you know, it's what you do.  You take over when he dies.  Oh, did you like McCain?  I did.  You know, I'd only met him for a brief second, but he's a good guy.  He's, you know, he seemed, uh, you know, I respected him a lot.  Yeah.  You said he took your hand and he looked at your hand and he said that you had fucking  like rough, like working man hands.  I was working man there.  I was.  Yeah.  Thanks.  And you do.  I shook your hand when you came in.  He does.  He, he's like one of those, Levi's one of those guys with fucking like rock hands.  Yeah.  Like certain people just have like those fucking granite hands.  You must throw a big punch. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not saying I'd like you to do that.  I'm just saying you must pack a good punch.  What did you think?  Like, didn't Bristol just come out and say you like stole her virginity?  Yeah.  That was, you know, that was one of the new things in her book.  Yeah.  And that, you know, that's, that's hard for anybody to, you know, even respond to.  That's horrible.  That's a horrifying thing to say.  You know, we dated for, for, you know, many years and, uh, we had a child together.  So for someone to come out and say that after, you know, everything we've been through,  it's just flat out lies and disgusting.  Do you think that's coming from her or do you think that's coming from the family who's 
[02:50:00]  trying to kind of wreck you?  Um, a little of both, you know, I, I, Bristol, I, you know, used to knew, I mean, we were in  love.  I mean, that would have never came out of her mouth.  I mean, it's just this lie.  So whether they, you know, they're trying to, uh, get me in trouble or, you know, hurt  me or whatever, you know, I mean, that's, that's clearly what they're trying to do.  Yeah.  And there's no way to argue it.  Like, oh, okay.  Uh, they say we have, uh, X amount of time left.  Yes.  Shit.  Oh, oh my God.  It's not 25.  Okay.  Uh, I have to ask you a couple of questions cause you hung out with Kathy Griffin.  I had, did you bang Kathy Griffin? 
[02:50:30]  No, I didn't.  No.  But I, she's great.  And I, you know, I mean, she's never a dull moment with her and I, you know, I love  her.  She is very funny.  I like her a lot.  Um, okay.  We talked about that.  We talked about, we talked about almost everything.  Okay.  Cool.  Oh, was there any indication like the whole Glenn Rice thing just came out?  About Sarah Palin that she had, uh, she's some kind of relationship.  Allegedly, they say she slept with him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that, I guess that never came up.  Um, that, uh, like you never came home and found like menthol cigarettes and fungues 
[02:51:00]  laying around the house.  No, I didn't.  No.  Okay.  But there was no indication that she had had any kind of a hookup with athletes.  Um, not that I've seen.  No.  All right.  And I, and we feel bad kind of, because we talked to, it sounds like we're really trying  to, uh, uh, uh, just attack Sarah Palin, but that is what the book is.  You have firsthand knowledge.  And you said, cause she attacked him brutally.  So is that, this is more like him saying, well, look, not only is this not true, but  this is what is true.  Yeah.  That's a fair point.  Um, and you said at one point girls, you know, think that she had like a cougar thing  for you and that was coming from girls.  You knew that that was coming from not only girls, but a lot, you know, some of my guy 
[02:51:30]  friends too.  That was definitely an issue that everybody kept bringing up, but I never seen it till,  you know, no, I mean, I still don't, you know, I still don't really believe it,  but I mean, it's, you know, what a lot of people have told me that she kind of  wanted to maybe, I don't know, I don't know, kind of gross, but, uh, really?  I guess so.  If your girlfriend's mom, I mean, from my point of view, like I'd probably do it just  for the credit, just to go on Twitter.  All right.  The book is called deer in the headlights and you're very forthcoming in the book. 
[02:52:00]  You're very honest in the book.  And I, and I love the stuff you said, whether you like, or don't like Sarah Palin.  I mean, this is coming from somebody who has intimate knowledge of her and is saying  exactly what he wants to say.  It's called my life in Sarah Palin's crosshairs.  And, um, the 29th is a signing at Barnes and Noble in Alaska, Anchorage.  And, uh, you know, I'm sure that that'll be promoted there.  And, uh, thanks for coming in, man.  And I really honestly loved your book.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll go to break.  Sirius XM, the virus.  What's worse than a heart attack? 
[02:52:30]  Man, I am so lost.  I need directions.  What the fuck?  Maybe that stereotypical Italian could help me.  Oh, what the fuck?  Hey, man, I was wondering if you could help me out.  I'm not from around here.  I'm from Utah.  Utah.  What the fuck is that?  It's, uh, west of here.  Anyway, do you think you can give me directions to the Apollo Theater?  No.  No.  No.  You can't talk.  You can't talk.  It's too crowded.  What do you mean crowded?  Can I say the N word a little bit?  No.  No.  Can I say the N word?  No, we can't say the N word.  What the fuck?  Come on, man.  What are you, racist or something?  This is my accent.  This is my accent. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  Well, all right.  I just say fuck you in Jewish.  Trust me.  Trust me.  Dude, what the fuck, man?  Are you serious?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  No, you what the fuck.  I said what the fuck.  Okay, I know.  You said what the fuck.  You said what the fuck a thousand times already.  That's all you say.  What was I talking about?  I just figured out what the fuck I was talking about.  I just figured out what the fuck I was talking about.  Um, your blatant racism.  Ah, yeah.  No, I come Polish girls don't like dildos because their teeth fall out.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Just, just, just wow.  All right. 
[02:53:30]  If I'm facing east, now which, which way do I got to go?  Ah, I, they start from the bottom, top, top and bottom.  I don't know what the fuck I would do.  What?  I don't know.  What?  It's an elephant.  I can't, I, I cannot understand you.  Okay, like a minestrone.  I can't understand you.  No, no.  It's exciting.  It's exciting.  Hey, I've had enough of this.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  What the fuck?  I'm getting the fuck out of here.  The fuck, dad.  I'm gone, you mumbling asshole.  What are you, retarded? 
[02:54:00]  It's possible.  Serious.  XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it is.  We're back without O.P. and Anthony.  We're in court.  Yeah, we actually, uh, we have a little update.  I guess we should play a sweeper if we're going to do the update, right?  Yeah, quick update, sweeper.  Yes.  Toadogate, 2011.  Oh, shooey. 
[02:54:30]  I love Sandy Caintrops.  Toadogate?  Yes, they're in the courtroom.  Opie and Anthony are getting sued by a performer who is in her 70s, I think.  This was a growth by her vagina.  Who has, yeah, a genital wart near her vagina that we named Twato.  Okay.  Because Opie broke her guitar a year and a half ago, and so she decided to sue Opie and Anthony.  So that's why they're not here today.  For breaking her guitar.  For breaking her guitar and for Anthony shooting bullets into her hat. 
[02:55:00]  He took her hat to a range.  They stole her hat, allegedly.  Allegedly.  And he allegedly shot it at a shooting range.  I'm sure he probably filmed the whole thing as he was doing it, right?  Well, yeah, it's actually this photo of it.  I know, but allegedly.  Yeah, so Kenny called in while the Levi Johnston interview was going on, but obviously we couldn't  talk to him, and now we can't get a hold of him because he's in the courtroom.  Any update from Kenny beyond that?  The only, like I said, is there anything you could at least text me over the phone?  And he goes, we are in the halls of justice. 
[02:55:30]  Okay, so they're in the halls of justice.  Justice is being served.  There's no such thing as justice.  I've been there.  And Opie just tweeted that they have entered the courtroom and no sign of Sandy Cain yet.  Okay.  We will continue.  Maybe it'll just get thrown out.  Maybe.  If she doesn't show up, probably, yeah, definitely.  We'll continue.  Maybe she's not.  I mean, she's like 80 years old or something.  With Twatogate coverage.  Twatogate.  Twatogate. 
[02:56:00]  Sometimes a woman needs to be raped.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey.  I feel that same way about men's asses.  Which is why this time I decided to wear my penis.  Brittany Andrews is back.  Yeah, we had Brittany is back with Kristen.  I'm the only one here I'd like to mention without penis.  Yeah.  Yeah, you really are.  That's right.  She's the only straight up pussy in the room. 
[02:56:30]  That's right.  But you have a little pink penis.  That's not very threatening.  It's almost.  It's not.  It's my Brittany Andrews strap-on starter kit.  Looks like Japanimation.  Because I know that you're a little slept, but what about taking you down over there?  No, I mean, I, you know, I have so much to do over here that I can't.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the only problem.  You know what?  Actually, the good thing about it is, is I could still do it while you get everything else done.  Well, I just don't know if I could.  It's a slip-on.  It's a slip-on tool.  Yeah.  No, I just don't know if I could handle.  Yeah, you could.  It's a small.  That's why I wore a small. 
[02:57:00]  It's the starter kit.  It's a Brittany Andrews strap-on starter kit.  I appreciate you doing that, but the problem is that we left the last portion of our interview  unanswered.  Which was that?  What part?  You were just about to talk about what you would say to humiliate the man.  Oh, exactly.  Well, bend over, bitch, and we'll start.  Okay.  Well, no.  See, the thing is, what I like about a strap-on, I've never been fucked with a strap-on.  You haven't?  No.  Get out of here.  No, my ass just won't.  I've tried, but my ass is just too, it just doesn't happen for me physically. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, you know, I can shove.  I've raped over, like, a thousand.  I'm not saying that an object couldn't be forcefully shoved into my asshole.  No, but I'm saying, if you're doing it for enjoyment purposes, it has not happened for  him.  Exactly.  Right, but I mean, like, that's my point.  Like, this is really my strap-on, my starter kit that I always start with everybody that's  never...  Yeah, exactly.  That when people haven't done it before, this is the one that I always use, and I've never  not been able to with proper spit.  No, I'm grabbing the one that everyone has used.  No, this is a brand new one, babe. 
[02:58:00]  I like this.  If I'm going to look at a girl...  I put it in the dishwasher, so...  If I'm going to look at a girl with a strap-on, I like her to be, like, naked.  I like the straps where they fit around a girl's ass.  There's something sexy about a girl...  It's not even the dick part that's sexy.  I was about to ask you what about the dick part that's sexy.  No, but that's...  He's like, no, really.  It's all about the straps around the ass.  It's like, baby.  There's something really fucking sexy.  It's the big black cock that's just looming in front of your face.  I've never had a black one in front of me.  You haven't?  No.  I was going to bring my black one, but actually, I wasn't going to bring a penis at all, and 
[02:58:30]  then as I was, like, running out the door, I was like, just in case I might want to  wear a kiss.  Yeah, that's the way it is.  Because, you know, the thing about it is, it's like, I'm really attached to my penis,  but my penis is not always attached to me.  I understand.  I see.  Yeah.  I understand.  I'm kind of sad about that.  I would love to be a hermaphrodite.  You would?  I so would.  It's a great bumper sticker.  I would love to be a hermaphrodite.  Brought to you by DJ Miss B.  Oh, my God.  You could just, like, you know, stay home and just fuck yourself, right?  You've got everything.  Well, you need to work on your flexibility, too, I would think.  Yeah, because your dick probably wouldn't get hard. 
[02:59:00]  Hermaphrodites are a mess.  They're a mess.  The whole thing down there, it's like, what's happening?  Nobody knows.  Oh, my God.  But that's just...  I mean, because that's, like, that's what I'm more or less doing all the time is, you know,  I've got the penis and the pussy, right?  Sure.  So, like, I love, like, shoving my cock into a guy's mouth and then, like, having him  suck the cock and then taking it out and then moving the penis over and having him lick  the toitée, spitting on him, shoving the cock back in, taking it out.  Oh, you spit.  I like that.  She spits on guys.  It's fucking hot.  Yeah, I spit.  I piss.  I love pissing on guys, too. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  I fucking love that.  Have you ever had that happen to you?  Good biatch.  Oh, of course.  Have you not had anyone ever give you a golden shower before?  I've never been pissed on, but Norton is...  Then we're in the same boat.  No, but these two, on the other hand, Norton is an old pro when it comes to being pissed.  I haven't in a while, but, yeah.  I just peed on a really hot...  I peed in her ass the other night.  It was really hot.  I would never want it in my ass.  I would just feel silly.  But it's so hot.  I'd blow in front of an Italian's house.  Face down, ass up with, like, you know, after you got done, like, you know, plummeting  it, and it's gaping, and you just... 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  Do you shave?  Obviously, you shave.  How much do you shave?  Where did that come from?  Because I meant to ask you before, I forgot.  I'm like, I'm talking about pissing in somebody's ass.  He's like, do you shave?  How much do you shave?  I've been bald forever.  Oh, good, good, good.  Okay.  I'm a bald bitch.  That's cool.  Are you bald?  Or do you have the running...  Do you have the runway?  Or you can't talk about that?  Sure she can.  Politicians can mention pubic hairstyles.  Yeah, they always do.  That's the sign of a good platform.  As a matter of fact, that's the one thing that Sarah Palin was not upset about, Levi  Johnson exposing in his book. 
[03:00:30]  Or what?  Was it about his...  It's how he trims his bald hair?  She has a Hitler mustache and there's a monocle over her.  Too funny.  So how was the interview with the guy?  Me and Kristen, we were talking the player's bald talk back there, so...  He was very...  He was fine.  He was good.  Is there a website with all the player's bald information on it?  Um, no, not at this time because it's our first one, but we are planning on, you know,  doing it on a more regular basis, so...  Well, you're also...  Are you going to tweet about it and stuff?  Oh, we've been tweeting like nuts. 
[03:01:00]  Tweeting, Facebooking, you can go to Facebook Manhattan Madam or tweet Manhattan Madam.  So how...  What would you say to humiliate somebody?  Ah, as we go back and...  That's a great question.  I want to know.  Because to me, it's got to be...  Well, like I said, I really love small penis humiliation.  It's got to be real, though.  It has to be something...  It has to be something organic about it.  Fucking...  Yeah, exactly.  You have to be, like, looking in the guy's eyes, spitting on him, shoving your hand  down their throat, you know.  Oh, the hand down their throat.  If you were with Jim and you were being intimate together...  Yeah, I'd just talk about the small penis, man. 
[03:01:30]  But would you talk about other men that you had been with?  I'd talk about a big black cock fucking me.  Yeah?  I don't like it goofy either when I'm being dirty.  It's got to be fucking perverted.  She's telling you a real story.  Because you've got to be looking into, you know...  I'm going to, like, make him go be a whore for me.  Like if a girl ever spank him...  Make him suck cock for me.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Bring mommy back the money.  And a cheap hotel.  And a cheap hotel, like, in the Bronx or something.  Okay, then I would go, but mother, where will I get a car? 
[03:02:00]  And then I would say, don't worry about it.  Mistress mommy has got a ride for you, baby.  It gets weird sometimes.  Yeah, it does get a little weird sometimes.  All right.  It's okay.  No, I always say unsexy things during it, though.  Like, sorry.  So you would say...  Well, sometimes, like, when you are role-playing, like, you just...  Some fucked up shit comes out.  And the two of you look at each other, and it's been really intense.  And then it's just, you crack up laughing.  Because it's like, where the hell did that come from?  Let's try it a little. 
[03:02:30]  Let's see.  Let's see.  Because I don't role-play much, and I don't understand how it works.  All right, but I have to, like, put him down in the ground and, like, shove my cock in  his mouth.  Like, that's where we have to start.  No, I won't suck it, but I normally would if I...  It's brand new, though.  Come on, dude.  It's been in the dishwasher.  It's been in the dishwasher.  No, you can rub it on my...  She's rubbing it on my face, and she's rubbing it on the outside of my lips.  But no, I can't suck it.  You can suck it, baby.  Well, he just doesn't know where it's been.  I can understand that.  No, I won't suck a stranger without a condom on it.  Brand new, actually.  That's the one time you'll use a condom when it's...  You know, I'm blowing a strap on it. 
[03:03:00]  But you've not done that before.  I know, I do actually put them in...  I put all my dildos and everything.  I put them in the dishwasher.  I know, it's great.  There's cascade on it.  Exactly.  So when people come to my house, they're like, you know, I don't really want to drink.  White water stains on it.  Do you have any disposable, like, cups we can drink from?  A dildo with no spots.  That's what you look for.  All right, so what would you say to me?  How would we role-play?  Like, all right, okay, you start, because I wouldn't know what I was doing.  Like, I was just kind of in the corner, sheepish.  Sheepish and crying.  Huh? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Like, how would you start the role-play?  I'm not, like, a very good actress to, like, do that.  Me neither.  I have to be, like, involved in there in the moment.  Okay, just kind of what kind of things would you say?  You don't have to say them sexy, but what things might you say?  Well, you know, I guess it, you know, it just starts off as you're my dirty little whore  or my little fuckhole.  Nice language.  That's what I would say back in.  Let me see that ass, my little fuckhole, my dirty little bitch from Mommy.  Okie doke.  Okie doke. 
[03:04:00]  Lost the sex bill there.  Giving her nothing.  I lost the sex bill there.  Is that unsexy if I say okie doke?  Yeah, that's when you get slapped and you say, talk appropriately to your mistress.  Don't be a stupid little whore, which, of course, we already know that you are.  Suck my cock.  Things like that.  Would you like that?  I would like that a lot, actually.  Does it look like I give a fuck whether he likes it or not?  No.  Exactly.  Hello.  No, it doesn't.  Miss B.  No, Miss B.  No, Miss B.  No.  No, it does not.  Bend over OTK.  You know what OTK is, right?  Over the knee, of course.  Exactly.  I didn't know that.  And then, you know what? 
[03:04:30]  I didn't know that either.  And if you don't act good for your mistress Mommy, then you're going to have a little  CBT.  What's CBT?  CBT is cockball torture.  Exactly.  I didn't know that either.  I can only handle, by the way, for the record.  I'm learning a lot right now.  Yes, I'm learning a lot right now.  This is S&M one-on-one here, people, on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Very light CBT.  I cannot handle rough CBT.  It's not like that.  Yeah, there's a pretty...  Oh, my God.  I remember I had a guy back in the day on set put a freaking grip clamp on his balls. 
[03:05:00]  A grip clamp.  You know, like for when you're shooting.  He was never going to have children.  He was never going to have children.  Definitely not.  On the ball itself?  And it's so funny, too.  Like, I had this other guy one time that used to come to me, and he used to bring a briefcase  full of weights, and he's giving me a handjob.  Okay.  Wow.  Right here.  Jimmy Norton is now giving a handjob.  My twaté is getting wet.  Ah.  I'm just talking about this.  A handjob.  A handjob.  Well, Brittany Andrews is talking.  That totally makes sense.  I totally, like, rocks.  I love that.  That's so hot.  My twaté was starting to thump.  Jim was giving her a handjob under the table. 
[03:05:30]  Yes, he so was.  He's playing with my pink penis.  The only way to do it is you have to look straight ahead so nobody knows what you're  doing.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, no, yeah.  None of us could see that.  It's like, if you can't see me, I can't.  Yeah, come back.  Oh, my God.  But, yeah, so I had this guy, right, that used to come to me with, like, a briefcase full  of weight.  And so he's got, like, 30 pounds hanging off his frickin' balls.  And he goes to me, and he looks at me sincerely in the face, and he's like, I'm not sure if  I'm really into this or not.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Who the hell can have 30 pounds of weight on their balls if they're not into it? 
[03:06:00]  I'm like, dude, you're into it.  You're deep.  You're deep into it, exactly.  Imagine going through airport security.  Oh, my God.  That happened to me.  Write that down for yourself.  I had that happen to me.  I was with the, I had this fuck buddy in London who was, like, really into it, and I forgot.  Was his name Big Ben?  Oh, hey.  Actually, he's, like, a guitarist with, like, this famous band.  And so I totally forgot.  I had it in my carry-on, and I was running late, and I was going through security, and they  stopped me, and I'm like, what?  You know, da-da-da-da-da. 
[03:06:30]  And they're like, you have a fishing bait in your bag here.  I'm like, that's not fishing bait, you know, because I'm, like, in a rush.  And they're like, well, what is it?  I'm like, yeah, that's a, those are weights for cock and ball torture, actually.  They're like, all of a sudden, they, like, dropped it immediately, realizing that that  had been on somebody's penis.  Have you ever been with a guy that does characters?  Because a lot of people...  I've always wanted to have sex with John Leguizamo.  Have you ever...  Because, you know, he does, like, the Asian guy, and I have a huge, like, Asian fetish. 
[03:07:00]  He does the tranny thing really well, and we know I have the tranny fetish.  You know, I love Latin, so, I mean...  But he runs away from me, like, I'm the crazy stalking fan or something.  Because you talk very rapidly.  Yeah.  That's why.  You don't seem perverted.  I'm not saying you're not, but you talk very rapidly.  You seem very, uh...  Because I'm, like, I haven't slept in, like, for...  I'm, like, on sleep deprivation high.  Yeah.  Because I don't know if he wants to...  If he's gonna...  But Chip Chipperson is a guy who does a lot of dirty talk on our show.  Uh-huh.  He's a guy.  Yeah.  So, but, like, when we've had girls on Pal Talk or on the phone or something... 
[03:07:30]  And Chip will, like, kind of have a little phone sex with them.  Yeah, get them all wet at the phone.  So, it's actually...  Puts you to sleep?  But, no, I just...  It's a character I do.  Oh, I see.  You do the character.  I thought there was somebody...  What?  You're killing the illusion.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, nobody knew.  Apologize.  Uh-oh.  Sorry.  I just keep looking down at a little pink penis.  I don't like the color of it.  If it was white, it would be fine, but just pick it looks...  What's wrong with pink?  It matches my hair.  It's like a dog's bone.  It matches my...  Oh, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Come here, Rex.  It matches my penis.  It matches my pussy.  Get the mailman.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is something creepy about a pink dick.  Wait, you don't...  Would you prefer it to be green?  No, I don't like fucking...  I don't like fluorescent colors.  I'm dirty.  I don't understand with a lot of these dildos that they have out for women.  They make no sense to me whatsoever at all.  They're shaped like holes.  Like frogs and animals and dolphins.  I don't want to fuck a dolphin.  Exactly.  What the hell?  I don't want a pink penis in my mouth.  Yes, you do.  Don't talk back to your mother.  I will make you... 
[03:08:30]  No, don't even start with me.  Your mother is...  Hey, are you going down?  Oh, no.  All right, her hands...  Bad boy, bad boy.  She just shoved her hand on my throat, which is kind of hot.  Did you like it?  I did.  I was going to spit on him, but I thought maybe that might be a little bit of...  I kind of just gave him a whoosh.  How would you feel if she spat in your mouth?  I probably could until we were talking.  Like, if I knew her a little bit better, I would allow that.  And then I shove it in my hand in the mouth and spit on it, get it all nice and wet,  and then it goes in the ass.  Your hand was deep into his mouth, though. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, that doesn't really bother me.  Yeah, I've got his goo.  You can see it.  My mouth is pretty clean.  Yeah, there it is.  Okay, so you won't suck the penis that's been in the dishwasher, but the hand that's been  on the penis that's been on the dishwasher, you won't put in your mouth.  I don't see the difference.  Or the hand that's been in the ass already, of course.  No one says that you're not going to have gubernatorial logic.  Yeah.  But, it's like the hand is much better than the dick is, because you're opening doors  the whole time and shaking hands.  But again, I wasn't thinking in that moment.  You were thinking you were coming from a sexual... 
[03:09:30]  You were going with the flow, but when you look at the fluorescent pink penis, you can't  really quite wrap your mouth around it.  And you know what?  When you're completely naked, the pink penis is pretty hot, actually.  Is it?  Yeah, I have pink shoes that match it as well.  And my hair is pink as well right now, so it works.  What if she was accessorizing with the penis?  It wouldn't bother me.  It's all the mentality that does it for me.  She just needs to see the boobs, probably.  No, I would love to, yeah.  It's all the mentality.  Dominating somebody is not like...  Yeah, it's all about...  I had a Dom one time tell me, 
[03:10:00]  Neil, slave!  I'm like, ugh.  No.  I'm not a slave, you zilch.  She just didn't know how to read the room.  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  I'm a fetish guy.  I like to use the word pet more.  My little pet.  Even slave is okay, but the way she said it was so fucking cheesy, like somebody doing  a Dom impression.  Honan the Barbarian.  Yes.  What did they say?  Like dominance?  It's like, it's not like a commanding somebody.  It's a being in a sense of commanding.  You know what?  I guess I'm not saying it right, but you could, you know, it's like not making somebody do 
[03:10:30]  something.  It's making somebody want to do something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very, very subtle, I think.  Real domination is very subtle.  Someone can put you in that.  There's very few people that have ever been able to put me in that really zone where you're  high.  It's fucking, it's hot when you're there.  Yeah, it is.  I can put women in that just by saying sexy, dominant things when I spank them.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  Really?  You don't like being spanked.  No, you're dominant.  That's why.  I like to say things like.  It's so funny because I recently did a scene because I'm kind of like semi-retired from  the business.  Sure.  I primarily produce mainstream films now and just DJ. 
[03:11:00]  DJ, but I did a scene for browsers promoting their, their condom campaign, even though they  don't allow condoms in their films.  Um, so I did the scene with them and like, you know, films have become so with the man  being so degrading and dominating towards women.  Yeah.  Like me and the guy, the entire scene was like me and him fighting, you know, at one  point I like turn around and just clock the bitch.  I was like, seriously, you're fucking with the wrong bitch.  Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:11:30]  Was that because he was just taking liberties because that's the way things are done now?  Yeah.  And I'm just like, that's not the way things are done.  Taking liberties.  That's real porn talk, Sam.  He was taking liberties with the young lady.  I think I have a little gubernatorial logic myself.  I'll say.  Taking liberties.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear your whole philosophy there.  That was it.  That was it.  Just saying the word liberties.  Like when I dominate a woman, I'll say things like, uh, take that you.  Take that you.  I bet.  Yeah.  I'm going to do this until you have cancer. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  That's not hot.  That's not hot, babe.  That's how you read the room.  Exactly.  She's bummed everyone out.  Like, I'm going to die.  Why?  Why would you keep doing this until I have cancer?  I just think you're like, I really want to give her, like, she knows she's getting spent  good.  And then, like, you know, lock them up in the bathroom, like, in cold water until they're  crying.  Have you ever shit on anybody?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Oh, have you?  Oh, my God.  I have this great story.  I did this film where I had a stunt shitter because I couldn't do it.  So it was, like, so funny. 
[03:12:30]  I, like, had, like, this chair over the guy and I just couldn't, I couldn't do it.  How are you doing scat in America, by the way?  How are you doing those kind of films in America?  Um, yeah, you know, it wasn't my production, so.  Oh, okay, okay.  And the girl that did it is a girlfriend of mine, so I'm not going to say which production  it was.  I almost did for a second, but I'm like, yeah, maybe not.  Was it on a person or was it into an object?  No, it was on a person.  And so it was, like, hilarious because she's like, oh, don't worry about it.  Just get your ass off of there and I'll do it, right?  So I'm like, okay, cool.  So they cut the shot.  She sat down, shit on him, and then cut back to me, like, for the scene so it looked like 
[03:13:00]  I did the do.  Wow.  Are there links to this?  Not that I would see it, but.  I don't know if you would go looking or anything.  I think it's called.  I would look out of curiosity.  I think it's called Man Attack or something like that.  Man Attack.  Man Attack.  That sure is a Man Attack.  We should also plug the Twitters while we have a second.  Yay!  So DJ Miss B XXXX.  Is that your real Twitter?  Yeah, DJ Miss B XXXX.  And then you're also on Facebook, just Brittany Andrews.  Yeah, I've got, like, ten Facebook accounts, so good luck. 
[03:13:30]  Roll and put your MySpace plug on here.  That's great for 1988.  Actually, you know what?  Internationally, though, it still says really good for a lot of stuff.  So it's Miss Brittany Andrews on MySpace, if you're still...  Everything is Brittany Andrews, Miss Brittany, except for the Twitter, DJ Miss B XXX.  Why don't you have Brittany Andrews?  Is that taken?  What?  Was Brittany Andrews taken on Twitter?  Oh, for Twitter, yeah.  DJ Miss B XXXX is the Twitter name.  Yeah, and I'm just, like, really using Twitter a lot to promote my DJ stuff, so it works out  good.  What kind of legitimate films are you doing?  Like, what producing?  Yeah, I had a film that I produced... 
[03:14:00]  I shouldn't say legitimate, like, mainstream, I should say.  Mainstream, yeah.  So, yeah, I produced a film called Crumble, which I got into the Cannes Film Festival.  It won six awards, and then I got another film that's been doing a small theatrical,  independent theatrical run called Trick of the Witch.  I had another film that was about 9-11 called Blindfold that won two awards.  I've got a film that...  What are they, short films?  Are they long films?  The horror film that's a feature film, the one in Cannes that was a short film.  How long was the short film, 20 minutes?  Yeah, around 20 minutes. 
[03:14:30]  What was it about?  It had Stephen Bauer in it from Scarface, Oxenolata from The Sopranos, and it was about,  you know, kind of getting outside of your boxes and perceptions.  It's a very kind of gritty art house film.  So, and then I've got a documentary that's coming out called Stage Brother.  It's starting its Film Fest run.  I mean, it's got a Jersey princess from the Bad Girls Club on Oxygen.  She's in the...  My ex used to watch Bad Girls Club, so I did kind of get roped in. 
[03:15:00]  She's going to be at the Players Ball.  She's going to be in the limo with us at the Players Ball.  She's fabulous.  We love her.  And so, yeah, I got quite...  And I'm, yeah, just got different things going on.  That's cool.  A couple of reality pilots that I did, too.  About what?  Doing adult movies or something else?  The reality pilots.  One of them's called True Cougar Life.  You're not a cougar, are you?  I am so a cougar.  Are you really?  Yeah.  I've been a cougar since I've been like 28.  You look, then you obviously look a lot younger than you are. 
[03:15:30]  You look very young.  Thank you.  The Botox is working.  Yeah?  Woo!  Yeah.  Because it's definitely not like my healthy lifestyle.  I mean, I'm being really healthy right now, but that's only because I'm so non-healthy.  Do you do drugs?  Well, I'm here supporting Kristen for her, you know, legalizing marijuana.  Oh, okay.  You know, it was like funny, like last night I took out the garbage really late and like  everybody on my floor at my apartment complex all smokes weed.  So you can smell the different strains of weed, like, okay, like apartment over here, 
[03:16:00]  like, and I'm like, literally, and I haven't smoked any, you know, for a month with my cleanse  and it's like, okay, which one has got the best stuff today, you know?  And then this morning, too, when I was leaving, like, there's like, everybody smokes weed on  my floor.  You can't smoke weed on the cleanse?  Hot?  No.  Why not?  It's like no drug, sex, or alcohol.  No sex?  No sex, yeah.  No drug, sex, or alcohol.  I meditate every day.  I go to church every week and I feed the homeless every Saturday.  So it's like my Ramadan.  It's like a spiritual cleanse. 
[03:16:30]  How long is it?  It's an awful cleanse.  It's 30 days.  What day are you on now?  Like 25.  Well, you're really easing your way out of it with a strap on, aren't you?  Yeah.  Did you just shove your hand in his mouth?  Did you just shove your hand in his sucker dick?  There was no penetration.  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  You forced his head down to your crotch a minute ago.  I was filling up when she first walked in and started talking about the cuckolding.  I was actually filling up, and I very rarely will fill up just chatting with somebody.  What do you mean, fill up?  My penis was doing this.  Throbbing.  I know when you started giving me the hand job, my twaté was throbbing.  Like a little bit of blood rushed down to the penis. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, it jumped.  It was like this.  That's nice.  To me, the twaté might be a little bit different than the cock.  Because you liked the idea of her talking about her other experiences while she was with  you.  There were more.  Yeah.  Did your vagina get bigger when you're turned on?  No.  I like that.  No.  I like it large.  No.  Not unless somebody's been sucking on it.  Do you have a big vagina or no?  I have a medium-sized cunt.  You can say that in here.  You can.  No problem. 
[03:17:30]  I tend to like really giant ones.  I don't know why.  Because they remind you of a cock.  Is that why?  No.  It's not.  I'm very oral.  I talk for a living.  What about you?  He's normal.  He's normal.  No, he doesn't talk dirty in me.  But you know what, though?  A lot of times people like yourself, that's vanilla.  You just haven't been appropriately introduced to it.  I just need the right person to shove a dildo up my ass.  Yeah, exactly.  That's true.  Maybe you just prefer to keep your intimate details private.  That's right.  Maybe I'm looking for a career in politics. 
[03:18:00]  Maybe you're really a freak and I don't know that.  No, I've talked to him in private.  I can see that.  You look a little freaky, dude.  Thank you.  You got that little creepy kind of freaky thing going on behind those eyes.  In a good way, though, right?  No.  In a good way.  I got your back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  He's the type that's walking out of the kid's room with an erection saying, nothing to see  here.  It's my freak.  I'm getting my freak on.  We're all just having a good time.  He's just picking his rattle up.  I like infantilism, too.  I'm down with that. 
[03:18:30]  I've never gotten into that.  I'll put you in some diapers.  Infantilism?  Yeah, there's something that's kind of hot about it.  You didn't dress up Big A as a baby that one time.  To promote my book, I don't know.  That was for humor value.  It's very creepy.  I think it's still on YouTube if you look around for it.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  We had a...  I don't know.  The whole changing the diaper thing can kind of be hot, though.  But I can't tell how dirty you are or if you're just really...  Like, you know all this stuff.  Yeah.  Like, are you a pervert or are you just really, really good at understanding perversion and 
[03:19:00]  what it looks like and portraying it?  I can't tell.  No.  If you're on the radio, it's hard to tell.  I started doing this at a very young age.  I'm Facebook friends with the first guy I've ever raped in the house.  Really?  Cool.  Yeah, it's funny because I didn't talk to him for like...  What's his Facebook name?  Ouch?  Yeah, exactly.  Ouch.  I didn't talk to him for like 20 years and then I reunited with him on Facebook and  I'm like, dude, you're so famous.  I've spoken about you in so many interviews over the years, you know.  And the guy, you know, pretty much doesn't have much of a life.  So... 
[03:19:30]  How did he take it?  Like, that's his claim to fame.  How did he take being raped?  Oh, my God.  We were like 13, 14 at that time.  Wow.  And, you know, it was one of those things of like where I didn't know anything about  strap-ons or dildos.  How could you at that age?  So, yeah, thankfully.  But like every time I go to Home Depot, I say a small prayer to God to say thank you  that nobody ever got hurt because the way that I first started raping guys in the ass  was with these fluorescent light bulbs, the long tubey things.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, exactly.  The ones that like...  Going to the hospital with shards of like broken fluorescent light bulbs.  It never happened.  Thank you, God.  The ones that you can throw into dumpsters and when they break, they explode.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Did we want to break?  Like, no, nothing ever broke in anybody's ass.  I guess I've just always been good at penetrating.  So you like that.  Strong skill.  So, yeah.  So it's, yeah.  I've been doing it a long time.  I was like a total punk rock chick when I was younger.  And like me and my girlfriends would drink like Jägermeister.  And we used to like wear all these.  We used to go to like Ace Hardware and get like all these, you know, like chains and make 
[03:20:30]  the chains.  It's very punk rock.  Right, right.  To like make your own.  We like drink Jäger and like beat up guys.  And my mom would like come knocking on the door like, what are you guys doing?  So what position is a guy normally in when you fuck him?  Like, is he on his stomach or hands and knees?  Oh my God.  This is the really hot thing about how good I am at like the whole ass raping thing.  Because I have really big tits, right?  Language.  So, hello, right?  So I have really big breasts.  So I have the guy on his back and I can fuck him in the ass and then put his cock and his 
[03:21:00]  penis in between my boobs.  So I can fuck his penis with my boobs while I'm fucking him in the ass.  I would just hate looking at my own stomach girl curled up like that.  I wouldn't even think about getting fucked in the ass.  I just don't know how often my gut looks.  Like your roll on the side.  Like a basset hound fell asleep on me.  I highly doubt anybody I've ever done that to has ever thought about their belly.  Because, I mean, they get to bust a nut two ways at one time.  Yeah, but I would rather...  I would rather...  I heard that prostate makes you cum harder.  But for me, it's like it's just hard to not have to shit when someone's putting a finger in my...  I don't mean to say that.  I don't mean to turn everybody in the room on. 
[03:21:30]  No, I mean like I prefer a cock in my ass over a finger.  So fingers are uncomfortable, but a cock just fits in perfectly.  I guess.  I wouldn't know.  Again, I wouldn't...  I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't know either.  Yeah, he's only like small animals.  Sam doesn't even talk dirty.  Yeah, I know.  Both of them are just like being voyeurs.  Kristen's like, I can't talk about this.  I'm running for governor.  But at least she understands.  Sam won't talk dirty.  I'm like, you're not mad at me for being the dirty bitch or a porn star that I am.  She's like, no, girlfriend, we love you for all you are.  I'm like, thank you. 
[03:22:00]  What nationality are you?  I'm total mutt.  I'm like a mixture of everything.  I'm primarily German, though.  Of course.  Yeah.  Of course.  Caviar party.  Do you speak German?  Hey, dozo.  I don't know if that's yes or no.  That's a...  That's a...  I speak a little Japanese.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mr. Rapato taught me.  I have like a huge Asian fetish.  Why?  I was in Tokyo with...  They're awful.  Oh my God, I love them.  They're not sexy.  Oh my God, I think they're so hot.  They're not.  Yes, they are. 
[03:22:30]  I'm turned on by Asian people.  Why?  Because they're not sexy.  Oh my God, their skin, their hair, their body types, how thin they are.  They're just...  Their asses.  They're...  I mean, everything.  Flat asses.  Yeah, what asses?  Exactly.  Oh my God.  They've got like the pinkest little buttholes you've ever seen.  Really?  Oh my God, and their skin is so soft, and their bodies are just so...  You're like a billion hairdos all the same?  I understand liking somebody slim.  That's one thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I love Japanese guys with long hair.  Well, they probably love you too, because you're a big blonde dom, so they fucking must 
[03:23:00]  crave you.  I had this Japanese slave boy for like almost a year, and I ruined...  I just fucked him up for life.  Do you mind a guy kissing your hiney?  Kissing my ass?  I expect it.  Okay, good.  I'm your fucking mistress, bitch.  Kiss my fucking ass.  Hello.  Oh, cool.  I like that.  Lick the latex and kiss my ass.  Hey, do you ever not wear deodorant?  I think that's really sexy too.  Uh, and what, like, have you licked my armpits?  Yeah.  Like a dirty bitch?  It depends.  It's a chemistry thing, though.  Sometimes women smell horrible without deodorant. 
[03:23:30]  It's great.  Women getting the wrong message from this show, just not wearing deodorant and stinking up  the joints.  Yeah.  Exactly.  A bunch of rotten pits.  It's like after you've been doing drugs for like three days, lick my armpit, slave bitch.  Yeah.  Smell.  Nothing worse than period pits.  Ew.  I didn't realize period pits were something.  I didn't either.  I don't...  I've never had that.  It's like she's smuggling two sub-sandwiches into the room.  Oh, no.  Kristen, did you know about period pits?  I've never heard of that in my entire life.  I know.  And I'm hoping that most people listening realize that it's Brittany Andrews that's speaking 
[03:24:00]  out.  Yes, exactly.  It is.  That's all I'm thinking right now.  Kristen's like being really quiet.  She has nothing to do with any of this.  I've been creepily staring at Kristen's legs the whole interview.  I apologize.  She's looking fabulous today.  I was looking at my legs.  You know what?  Your legs look really good, though.  I want to see your ass so bad.  Me, too.  I swear to God.  I've looked there, too.  You have really great legs.  Thank you.  I'm thinking you must have a really nice butt.  Like, we need to, like, find a way because she's running for governor, so she can't be  naughty.  But we can, like, do something, like, at a swimming pool one time at the beach. 
[03:24:30]  Did you hear...  I got to see that ass because, I mean, I'm obviously an ass woman.  She's all about the scrunch butt.  She has legs for me.  What's a scrunch butt?  It's like the bikini that's a scrunch and it's got a seam through the middle and it  pulls your butt up.  Oh, I need one of those.  Makes your butt look ten times better.  Yeah, I just want to get the implants.  Do you wear thong underpants?  No, she wears strap-ons.  My penis is a thong underpants.  Oh, yeah, it kind of is.  It is, totally.  Those are very sexy material pants that you're wearing, by the way. 
[03:25:00]  Thank you.  They're like spandex.  I like that.  It's a throwback to the 80s, babe.  Woo-hoo!  When you're a DJ porn star, you can get away with it, though.  Fantastic.  So, tell us again about the party.  The party.  It is called the Players' Ball, and we are encouraging everybody to come in their best  pimp and hoe ensemble.  Are you guys going to be pimps or hoes?  I don't know.  That one's a hard question for me to answer.  I'm a combination there, right?  Yeah.  I'm coming into myself, so I think that says enough. 
[03:25:30]  Exactly.  Which would be pimps.  The Manhattan Madam herself.  So, yeah.  So, and it's going to be at 92 Ludlau, and that is at Hotel Chantel, and it is Friday  night.  It starts at 9 promptly.  If you get there at 9, it is free.  Free for an hour.  After 10, it is $20 at the door.  And proceeds of it is going to?  To two charities.  We're dedicating part of the proceeds to Jordan Cipino for his bout with cancer, and the other  is for Hope House, which is my nonprofit for the victims of sex trafficking. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  That's great.  And we're going to have a ton of porn stars there.  A couple of reality stars, you said, too.  Woo!  Yeah, exactly.  We've got, we've got like 20 people coming in the limo with us.  We've got Pablo Escobar Jr.  Woo-hoo!  Great documentary, by the way, about his father.  We've got some dominatrixes that are coming.  My girlfriend Lola.  I saw that on HBO.  Hold on a second.  It's applying right through here.  Sorry!  Did you see the Pablo Escobar documentary about his father, where he met the sons of people  his father had murdered?  I would love to see it, but I didn't see it.  Yes. 
[03:26:30]  I saw you, I saw your, you know, comedy on HBO, too.  And I, I gotta tell you, I got through about half of it, and I felt embarrassed, and I had  to turn you off.  Why?  It was very dirty, right?  I don't know.  It was very dirty.  And because I know you in a different capacity, so how do you guys know each other so well?  That's a good question.  I know, right?  Yeah, she caught me smelling her shoes and masturbating, and she had me arrested.  Jim did say that he found Kristen very attractive.  I do.  She is freaking hot.  Hello.  Look at her.  She's like half naked here today.  Like, she looks so yummy.  It's wonderful.  I haven't had sex in like a month. 
[03:27:00]  I'm going to like eat her alive in the green room.  I'm like, I got my penis on.  I was in a suit, and everyone thought I would.  And then the next time, in a dress, and everyone was like, you've lost so much weight.  And I said, no, I was just showing some leg.  So I realized here that I must dress appropriately.  So was my special too dirty for you?  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  It was good.  I was impressed.  I was impressed, but a little embarrassed.  So I turned you off.  She's bashful.  The whole thing.  How cute.  She's bashful.  Who was that?  Wait, but which one was it, though? 
[03:27:30]  It was, I think, your most recent one.  Was I wearing a black shirt?  You're always wearing a black shirt.  I know, but I wasn't wearing a long-sleeved shirt.  No, you were wearing a black shirt.  Okay.  That was, yes, I know which one that was.  Was that a dirty one?  You know what?  I actually did a little comedy back in the day.  I worked at the Improv for a while.  In Melrose?  Yeah, Melrose, and I actually did a tour of their different, of all the different improvs  in California.  When did you do that?  That was quite a few years back, but I've done a couple of roasts since I've done a 
[03:28:00]  couple of roasts since I've done comedy.  It's a lot of fun.  Why did you stop?  Because, you know, I actually did that show, it was on MTV, Your Mama Knows, something like  that.  Was it new, like in the last couple of years?  No, it was probably, like, maybe 10 years ago or something.  But yeah, for a while, I was doing the whole comedy thing.  Yo Mama?  Remember that show on MTV?  Yo Mama?  Yeah.  But no, that was like...  Yo Mama jokes?  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.  Wilmer Valderrama was the host.  Yes, exactly.  I was on that show, exactly.  Wait, how many years are we going back now? 
[03:28:30]  Because you guys are aging yourselves.  Let me just throw that out there.  You know what, though?  At the end of the day...  That was before my time.  Let me throw that out there.  I was on laughing.  The great thing about it is that...  Yeah, exactly.  My head poked out of a box.  I'm like, you know what?  The good thing about it is the cougar in the milf is fabulous right now.  So I'm just going to rock out with my cock out and it's all good.  I don't see you as a cougar.  Why don't you see me as a cougar?  I don't see you as a cougar either.  You have a very cute smile.  You don't have a cougar mouth.  You have a very cute little smile.  That's because it's been on a lot of ass.  Oh. 
[03:29:00]  That's a great reason for it to be that way.  I'm an ass-licking woman, I am.  Are you?  I am.  You look guys' asses?  Yes.  Good for you.  Yeah.  What a trooper.  What about you?  Do you lick women's asses?  No.  They ask me about that.  I think at some point in my life I might, but I'm not there yet.  You're not there yet.  You're working your way up.  You're working your way up.  Yeah, I'm just not there yet.  Just like go from the...  You start like the back of the knee right now.  I was just going to say, like, go from the twaté.  You're working your way up.  What is that thing called that's, like, in between the twaté and the ass, that piece  of, like...  It's got a name.  You need to work your way down that.  Oh, the place for your gum.  The taint.  Yeah, the taint.  You got to work your way down the taint, babe. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I think...  Like, each time, just, you know.  But I'm only 28.  I have a lot of life ahead of me.  Dude, I was eating ass when I was 15.  I know, right?  Well, you were also sober by the time you were 19.  We all take different pads.  I love eating ass.  It doesn't even have to be fucking showered.  No.  Come on after a good bout of the flu on a bike ride.  Hey!  It's also, like, armpits, as long as the moment's not on their feet.  I'm like into the armpit thing, too.  There's something about, like, just doing dirty things.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I wish they were best friends.  You do? 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, I could be best friends with Brittany.  Yay!  Would you be best friends with Jim?  You want to come as my date?  I can.  I'm going to be lying.  You can.  We can take both of you.  Yeah?  We can come as double dates.  Well, would you hang out with Jim, like, in life?  As long as he sucks my cock and is a good little bitch for mommy.  I'm sure at some point he'd be willing to do both those things.  I'm going to say that could be a safe bet.  That could be a safe bet.  Who wouldn't?  I would do that even if you didn't want me to.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't happen, babe.  Carolina Man summed this up on feedback by simply writing, 
[03:30:30]  I want to have sex with both of these women really badly.  Yeah.  That's how I would do it, really badly.  Really badly.  Poorly done.  Yeah.  I always get the ass.  I love DPing, but I always get the ass.  You do?  Have you ever DPed a girl with another girl?  No, I have not.  Me and my friend Porno Dan used to do that all the time.  He'd take the twat and I'd take the ass.  This Porno Dan sounds like he's done a lot in his life.  The guy sounds like a real Svengali.  Yeah.  He sounds like he's got game. 
[03:31:00]  Well, we used to co-produce stuff and travel all over the world together,  and, man, he will fuck anything.  Like, anything.  That is not a bragging point.  Yeah.  That is not a bragging point.  It's interesting.  It's a resume booster.  It's interesting to see what he will do.  I'm sorry.  And he can be on any type of substance,  and he still will get it up,  and he will have sex with anything.  So, I mean, just saying that it was always interesting.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  Traveling around the world with Porno Dan.  I can't always get an erection.  I have to kind of get an erection.  He can always get an erection,  and it's like, really?  You know, I hear.  He did, like, an eight ball,  and the bitch is, like, ugly behind the bar,  and he's, like, going for the gold.  It's like, really?  Wow.  They say pomegranate juice is good for erectile dysfunction.  Yeah.  Some guys are just, like.  I tried that, but they said you have to drink it.  Oh, my God.  Some guys are just, like, really good woodsmen.  That's what we call it in the business, good woodsmen.  But nowadays, they have Viagra.  I mean, back in the day when I first.  Best woodsman ever.  Back in the day when I first started,  they used to have to, like,  shoot up their penises with needles. 
[03:32:00]  Cabernet.  Yeah.  Like, yeah, because it's, like,  the things that the people that are handicapped would use.  But now it's.  Wait, wait, wait.  Well, you know, they, like,  did, like, a lot of broccoli.  Like, Peter North for the big busted nut scenes, right?  I thought there was vitamins.  Well, it's always been said that it's broccoli.  He's probably just lying.  Some people fart on him.  Yes.  He doesn't want to give away a secret.  He doesn't want people to know  because he wants to have the big lows.  So what do you think?  Wait, who's the best performer ever?  Who do you think is the best guy that could,  I would, I'm going to guess Nacho,  but who would you say?  Um, I really, yeah. 
[03:32:30]  I'm not really amused by porn guys.  No, but I'm saying,  who do you think is the,  can fuck under any conditions?  Yeah.  Oh, like my friend Pornodan  more than anybody else I've ever met.  Is he, is he in movies?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  He produces films.  I mean, I mean,  the guy can do so much drugs  and his dick will still work.  I mean, that's a real talent.  And he'll fuck anything.  And he'll fuck anything.  That's a great video testimonial.  Yeah.  He does so much drugs  and his dick will still work.  I mean.  Late night infomercial.  Yeah.  And like with a really ugly bitch, 
[03:33:00]  you know,  it's, it amuses me completely.  It's fantastic.  That's talent.  Well, I guess we did it.  That's true porn talent, man.  Yeah, if you want to,  before the show is over.  If you want to get all the info,  you guys will be tweeting it, right?  Yes, we will.  DJ Miss B, triple X,  please sign up.  I'm Manhattan Madam.  It's Manhattan Madam.  Is it Manhattan Madam?  Twitter.com Manhattan Madam?  It's DJ Miss B, X, X, X.  Yes, exactly.  The word triple is not there.  It's DJ Miss B, X, X, X on Twitter.  DJ Miss B, triple X,  and I've always got really fun stuff on Twitter.  Lots of pictures and stuff.  And then go to the party  because you may end up banging someone.  Go to the party.  Chantel, 92, the party. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I have to plug a gig.  Tampa, Florida.  I'll be at the Improv  29th of September through October 1st.  And then Pittsburgh  at the end of, I think, next month.  I think.  Or is it this month?  No, it might be this month.  Well, this is the end of this month.  Right.  September.  It's in October.  I'm in Pittsburgh then.  I just wanted to say  a super duper thank you guys  for having us on today  and letting us promote our party  and our Twitter.  And I hope you guys  can make the next one.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  And we can do like a big,  you know, costume party  and you can emcee it with me 
[03:34:00]  or something.  Give out some free prizes.  I'll dress up as Uncle Paul.  Exactly.  You can be my bitch.  You can be my whore  and I'll be your pimp.  I'm going to make you do dirty things  with the glory hole  in the back in the bathroom.  Sounds wonderful.  Yeah.  That's all I do.  Well, Jim, thank you for coming in  and carrying me through this.  Oh, it was a good time.  Thanks to Levi  and his book is Deer in Headlights.  Yes.  My life in Sarah Palin's crosshairs.  And I guess we will see you tomorrow  with the two hopefully not convicted  fucking creeps, Greg and Tony.  We'll be back.  We've got a big update. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, do we?  No, no, no.  We will have a big update tomorrow.  There's still nothing.  I guess they're still in the courtroom.  All right.  So we'll see you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  Thank you.  Bye.  The Virus.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I'm still here.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:35:00]  But in this case, it's after Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  Jim's taking off.  We want to say a very special thank you  to the ladies for coming by today.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you.  Have a wonderful day.  It's a good show without us.  Ciao, ciao.  I don't know how I'll be able to manage.  It's Miss Brittany, of course.  Brittany Andrews.  Roland.  How's it going, buddy?  You know. 
[03:35:30]  No, I don't.  It's okay.  Sal.  What's up?  What's going on today?  We haven't had a chat.  Oh, hey.  Can we get Kenny on the phone?  I just heard there was a Twitter update.  I'm trying.  Because.  Hello, Sam.  That doesn't sound anything like Club Soda Kenny.  As you may or may not know,  we're still following.  Toadogate.  Toadogate.  2011. 
[03:36:00]  It's chocolate, baby.  I love chocolate cock.  I don't pre-listen to them before I play them,  so they're surprises to me, too.  And I did get an update via Opie's Twitter just now.  Twitter slash Opie Radio.  That he said Sandy Kane didn't show up,  and they're leaving.  So I guess they won,  and they just got a day off work?  I don't know.  Troy.  Oh, you getting them for something? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  So I guess, I mean,  we're trying to get Club Soda Kenny or Opie or Anthony  or one of those representatives  to come on the after show today  because we have to get to the bottom.  You hear that, Sal?  Yes.  Apparently, Sandy didn't even show up.  I mean, after all this,  she didn't even bother.  I mean, there's no way she would have won anyway,  but I guess that goes to prove our point  that she's a lunatic  and she is not to be taken seriously 
[03:37:00]  under any circumstances.  So how are you doing, Roland?  Doing all right.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You sound a little down.  No.  Hmm?  A few dicks in the ass.  A few dicks in the ass.  Yeah.  Is that right?  Is that right?  Yeah.  You would have gotten along great with Brittany Andrews.  She loves putting dicks in asses.  Yeah, but mine's overloaded.  Roland's feeling a little down, Troy.  Why's that?  Troy just walked back in.  I said,  You sound a little down today, Roland. 
[03:37:30]  And I said,  Yeah, maybe.  And I said,  You okay?  And he responded by saying,  A few dicks in the ass.  I gotta tell you, man,  Roland has a tough job.  I gotta give him fucking some props.  You know what?  I mean,  I don't want to, you know,  throw a parade for the guy,  but I was just talking to Jess last night.  I talked to Roland on the phone  for a little bit last night  about some things that were happening  in our lives together  as partners.  And, uh,  business partners.  And, uh,  I said, 
[03:38:00]  I,  as soon as I hung up,  I was like,  talking to Jess.  I was like,  Jesus,  Roland has a difficult job.  Yeah.  He's,  it's like,  almost like spinning plates,  like 20 different plates.  Because he has to deal with,  uh,  Opie and Anthony Jim  and making sure they're happy.  At the same time,  he has to succumb to the wishes  of any of the bosses.  Right.  And those sometimes could conflict  with Opie and Anthony,  or sometimes Opie and Anthony  don't want to do something,  but they don't want to hear that, 
[03:38:30]  and Roland ends up being the middleman  for anything guest-related.  Um,  and then,  because we all have to deal with  talent and management  to some degree,  at least,  um,  Roland a little more than us,  but then,  he's got to deal with publicists.  Yes.  That's a whole nother set of levels  that we don't have to touch.  Spinning plates.  Yeah.  And then the talent on top of it.  On top of the publicists.  And then making sure  that the talent in the building  gets to the other locations  when they need to.  Right.  Like,  yeah.  And then,  yeah,  he has to deal with the rest 
[03:39:00]  of the talent department here  to make sure,  for instance,  Levi Johnston,  if Norton and me decided,  we're liking this interview,  we're going to keep him  down to 945.  Yeah,  screw the other channels.  That's a dick in the ass,  isn't it?  But,  see,  but for that one,  the next show is Alex Bennett.  He dicked me in the ass,  too.  What did he,  how did he dick you in the ass?  We were supposed to get  liners after Pendulet.  Ah.  And then his producers  never walked him over here.  So,  he said,  no problem,  buddy,  I'll walk him over here.  And,  thinking,  okay, 
[03:39:30]  a trusty fellow worker.  And then,  where's Penn?  He left a building,  and I was like,  dick in the ass.  Yeah.  And you've been getting him  a lot lately,  you're saying?  No,  just a few more than usual.  Over the last couple days,  it's just been a healthy amount.  I'm walking like a cowboy.  Yeah.  Boat-legged a little bit?  A little boat-legged.  Mm-hmm.  I put a little Vaseline last night.  Just to lube yourself up for today.  Lube it up.  Because you know it's coming.  How's today been?  Has today been a little better?  Yeah,  because LA's asleep,  so all posts are nice and asleep. 
[03:40:00]  LA's asleep.  They're tucked in bed.  Yeah,  some of the management isn't here,  the talent.  Like,  this is kind of a light day for you,  because a lot of the people  that you have to deal with,  talent and management both,  are at the courthouse right now,  where apparently,  Sandy Kane didn't even bother showing up.  Eric,  did we hear anything?  Yeah,  the update is,  is that there'll be no more updates.  They'll talk about it tomorrow.  Okay.  I'm just reporting what I read on Twitter,  because Opie tweeted that,  yeah,  Sandy apparently did not show up. 
[03:40:30]  So,  Sal.  Yes.  We haven't checked on your progress lately as an intern.  Sal,  for a long time,  the interns were non-existent here on the Opie and Anthony show.  Troy,  you remember that?  Oh,  yeah.  And,  I thought we were supposed to have two.  Yeah,  we do.  We have another one still coming?  I just got the email last night,  that the second one,  all his paperwork and everything's done.  I got to talk to him today,  and I believe he's going to start tomorrow.  He's going to debut tomorrow.  We use the word debut. 
[03:41:00]  Debut.  He's going to debut tomorrow.  Sal,  how long have you,  Sal is,  though,  after nine months,  it was actually,  without interns,  and Sal became the first member of the new class,  under the Nagle regime.  Actually,  his name is Salvador.  Salvador.  Salvador.  I got to give Eric some real props for picking Sal,  because Sal's doing a great job.  You,  on the other hand,  really picked some shit.  I didn't pick shitty interns.  Yeah,  you picked shitty interns.  No,  I didn't.  You did. 
[03:41:30]  I got to go.  Then go.  Don't come back.  Trey has no,  listen,  the interns that I picked are the people,  like,  intern David,  Oscar.  These are guys that people,  Love Buzz.  Love Buzz.  Evan.  Evan was great.  These are the guys that people still want to hear about.  Steve.  I don't know who that,  I don't,  I don't remember that one.  But,  Sal,  seems like you've been doing an okay job so far. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  No disasters that have been brought to the air anyway.  How has your training under the Nagle regime been?  Really good.  Yeah?  Yeah,  I think I got a good,  good understanding.  What are you doing here as an intern?  I guess,  because I just walk around searching for microphones I can talk into.  I don't keep up with what everybody else is doing.  I,  you know,  set up a breakdown in the studio.  One of my other jobs is to help try out the promo at the end of the day. 
[03:42:30]  Oh,  every day.  Yes,  every day.  And going through audio and stuff?  Yeah.  That's like real work.  That's like real person work.  Yeah,  I mean,  that's,  that's,  I give them tips.  Yeah,  Roland,  I mean,  yeah,  you know,  Roland helps me out with all that.  Roland goes,  did you try turning it on or move the mouse?  Roland's tip is,  okay,  when they start coming for you,  just bend over and grab your ankles because it's going up the ass,  regardless of whether you want it or not.  You better make it easy because it's going in.  Am I right,  Roland?  No.  Yes.  Roland's a broken man, 
[03:43:00]  Sal.  Yeah.  You don't want to be like Roland.  He's like,  I got a picture of you napping.  I'm like,  so does everybody else.  Yeah,  exactly.  There's like,  I have so much photo and video of Roland napping.  I can make a full length feature film,  a documentary,  a Ken Burns style movie.  So you're in here five days a week.  Yes.  I am.  You seem to be acclimating to the schedule because what time do you have to wake up in the morning?  Well,  I drive from Westchester.  Westchester. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  That's why I yelled it that way because that's where I'm from too.  I get up at like 10 to four because I'm like super sluggish in the morning.  Yeah.  So,  yeah.  So you got to,  you got to get going and then you come in here.  Yep.  Are you acclimating to the schedule?  Yeah.  The first week I was like,  yeah,  I was like,  you know,  super energetic.  I was fine with it.  And you're excited about it.  Yeah.  And this week,  like it hit me like the,  the exhaustion.  Is this your second week?  Is it?  Yeah.  You don't even know what week.  I'm pretty sure.  I think my napping rubs off on me. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  You just realize he's working and then I'm like taking a snoozer.  He's gotten good at maneuvering around Roland so he doesn't wake him up.  Yes.  Roland doesn't like to be disturbed when he's napping.  The lights are always off in that office.  Yeah.  They say it's because it keeps it cooler,  but everybody knows it's so they can nap.  And I say they.  No.  Iraq.  Oh no.  And also our office is still fucking hot.  Yeah,  it is.  Nobody fixes it.  Every office is hot in here.  No,  but they fixed it like five times.  And nothing helps.  Dick in the ass. 
[03:44:30]  Dick in the ass for Roland.  Dick in the ass by the maintenance.  Dick in the ass.  You get a dick in the ass and then you go back and it's a hot office.  Yeah,  the guy goes,  it's not hot.  I'm like,  why are you sweating too?  Just,  ah.  Yeah.  Well,  what's your,  what's your favorite thing that you do as an intern?  Probably the promo.  You like doing the promo?  I like doing the promo.  Yeah,  it's fine.  Because it's hands-on audio editing?  It's hands-on and it's kind of like you have to create a,  like a highlight in a way.  I'm just explaining what a promo is,  but,  uh,  and create like a sort of punchline. 
[03:45:00]  Oh,  sorry.  Roland's sleeping.  Yeah,  look.  Roland.  Yes.  Just because you take dicks in the ass doesn't mean you have to give everybody else one.  You understand?  You know what I mean?  I mean,  look,  let's look on the bright side.  Levi Johnston was in here today.  He had a great time,  right?  Yeah.  And you know what his bodyguard said?  That was a great interview.  Jim did a phenomenal job with Levi Johnston.  Yeah.  And,  and we got him out on time and he was a big get.  And,  and we talked to those,  you know,  those, 
[03:45:30]  uh,  uh,  porno girl,  Brittany Andrews.  So,  I mean,  it was a good day for you,  I would think.  Yeah.  Still recovering from the week though.  Yeah.  It's still,  the day's not over yet.  You're just expecting the worst.  It's like,  uh,  Imajod.  Imajod?  Yeah.  Whatever his name is.  Sal,  do you know anyone named Imajod?  Imajod?  Whatever his name is.  Eric Imajod?  I don't know.  Is he,  I think he's trying to say some kind of world leader's name. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  Captain Imajod.  That's him.  That's him.  Okay.  Um,  well,  where do you want to go,  Sal?  Where,  where do you want to go in this business?  Where do I want to go?  Let's get to know the intern today.  On after Opie and Anthony live.  Uh,  well,  I go to school for,  uh,  music production.  That's producing music of all sorts.  Ah,  so you want to,  you like the production end of things.  Yeah,  yeah,  definitely the production end of things.  You hanging out with Troy a lot?  Yeah,  Troy is fucking awesome.  You think so?  Yeah,  Troy is like,  he reminds me,  almost identical,  like,  personality and looks. 
[03:46:30]  Of an old you?  No,  no,  no.  Of,  uh,  one of my old roommates.  You think he's handsome?  Scott Peterson?  You think he's,  you think he's handsome?  Uh,  I mean,  I'm not attracted to him.  I'm not attracted to Troy.  But do you think he's handsome?  I,  I do.  Do you?  Sal was just in here,  uh,  singing your praises and talking about how awesome and handsome you are.  Oh,  that's very nice of you,  Sal.  Yeah,  he's good.  He's,  he's a good dude.  He,  he's,  he's quick.  He can turn shit around.  He's better than some of the other assholes that you brought in here. 
[03:47:00]  Some or all.  Pretty much.  I mean,  since I've been working with the show,  pretty,  I'd say mostly everybody,  by exception of Paul was pretty good.  Evan was okay.  But those two are the only two that I can think of that were.  Yeah,  but what about the entertainment value that some of the interns that I picked brought to the show?  Okay,  fine.  But I mean,  that's right.  I'm a producer of the show.  I'm,  I'm here looking at what's going to get us the most content.  Some people say,  oh,  we need an intern that can make production because that's content.  I say, 
[03:47:30]  let's have an intern that I'm going to want to bring on the air every single day.  That's content.  And you bring in retarded kids.  I don't bring in any retarded kids.  I've never brought in.  It was like the kids at Whitney High.  I've never brought,  I've never brought in a retarded,  Love Buzz was just stupid.  Love Buzz was a fucking idiot.  Yeah.  Well,  he was,  Love Buzz got the reputation of being the stupidest intern we've ever had.  Yeah.  There were some up there with him though.  Who?  Oh man.  I don't even know if I want to go down this road.  Who do you think was as stupid as Love Buzz?  Uh,  definitely Stevie. 
[03:48:00]  I don't remember Stevie.  Yeah.  It was a guy named Stevie.  Yeah.  I wasn't here for that.  He has something called around his burger.  Yeah.  So you know how to roll.  And I hope,  are you just like looking for dicks in the ass?  Okay.  I got it.  Um,  yeah.  Um,  but couldn't you mold some of those guys?  Not,  not even,  not even a chance.  You're talking about like an intern David.  There's just,  I mean,  they're just here for the goof,  which is,  all right, 
[03:48:30]  fine.  It creates on air content,  but then afterward you have to deal with these human beings.  You couldn't mold an intern David into something.  I mean,  what,  what did you mold him into?  I put,  turned him into a celebrity.  That's what I molded him into.  And he thought he was too,  didn't he?  Oh,  she sure did.  he certainly did.  You know,  I mean,  you know how to do that.  You know how to take a retard.  That's borderline drooling out of their mouth and let them believe that they have become.  And they all obey Sam too.  Oh yeah.  It's like,  uh,  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[03:49:00]  Sam is like their Messiah.  Yeah.  Like just follows them.  We have things in common.  We have things in common.  So we have common interests.  We hang out.  Like I remember that you,  I used to like David and me,  David,  the intern used to walk to grand central.  Uh,  even though David didn't have a train to go to in grand central,  he went to Penn station and he would walk me all the way to the train platform.  Or we'd catch,  we'd catch the subway in time square and I would have to get on the shuttle that goes right to grand central and David, 
[03:49:30]  I would,  I would want the company.  So David would jump on the shuttle with me.  And then once it got to grand central,  I got out and he would just stay on the shuttle,  go right back to time square.  Cause that's not where he was going.  That's a,  it's amazing.  But it's just,  he was my boy.  We were just hanging out.  It's amazing that you'd even want that.  Cause I can't,  couldn't wait to get away from them.  No,  I want to,  you just wanted to surround yourself with them.  Um,  it's a funny thing.  Travis went to the nine 11 Memorial.  If you remember like a week or two ago,  Travis was saying that he already got his tickets for the nine. 
[03:50:00]  Oh,  here he comes right now.  Uh,  he was saying he got his tickets.  If he sees me,  he can come in.  He got his,  yeah,  he got his tickets to the nine 11 Memorial.  We were just Travis talking about former interns.  And I had mentioned that you took a trip to the nine 11 Memorial.  Oh yeah.  And,  uh,  so when you're at the nine 11 Memorial,  they have guys who have iPads or whatever,  and they help,  uh,  find who,  where your loved one is or where anything is. 
[03:50:30]  Just,  if you have any question,  you can go up to them and they'll guide you throughout the,  Memorial.  And so Travis notices that one of the people doing the Memorial was indeed intern David.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well,  I was just,  uh,  you know,  walking around,  taking it all in.  And,  uh,  before I saw him,  you can bet I heard that voice.  No,  no,  no,  no.  He's not here.  Let's see what we can find.  He must've,  he must've, 
[03:51:00]  he must've gotten out of Pennsylvania.  He's not here.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  There's no mistaking that voice.  Right.  I was like,  holy shit.  It's intern David.  Yeah.  And so Travis sends me,  uh,  sends me a text.  I've never been more excited to send Sam a text.  He goes,  I'm at the nine 11 Memorial and he sends me this picture text of intern David with an iPad.  I go,  holy shit.  And,  uh,  but tell him because I was like,  you got to talk to him because I've talked to him on Facebook every now and then.  Cause he hasn't been here in well over a year.  It has to be a year and a half.  Two years.  Yeah.  I mean,  he came in a couple of times after his internship was over, 
[03:51:30]  but he just kind of stopped coming and he's blowing smoke up my ass.  Intern David has quite a few times.  That's smoke in the ass rolling,  not a dick in the ass.  It's a different deal.  He's blown smoke up my ass a couple of times and said,  yeah,  a Monday would be good.  This would be good.  But once it comes time to crunch time,  okay,  well I see you in studio tomorrow.  No response.  He panics.  Like he doesn't answer his phone calls.  And if you get him on Facebook and in the crunch time,  he won't,  he won't respond.  Was there something that happened toward the end? 
[03:52:00]  He told me that,  um,  and if you remember intern David,  um,  the fact that he was intern David ish is apparent upon meeting him.  I mean,  there is the first impression,  of intern David is exactly what you all heard on the air.  Um,  if we have time,  we might,  do we have any intern David bits that are short?  Just so.  Let me look.  Okay.  Um,  and he thought that being on the show and his experiences on the show had stopped him from getting jobs. 
[03:52:30]  Like he said,  he couldn't find a job ever since he left the show.  And he believed that was because of his time on the show.  Oh,  and so that's why I think he's trying to distance himself.  Yeah.  Um,  I saw him and,  and we made eye contact and I said,  David,  and he was visibly frazzled for a second.  Like when you touch him and he jumps.  Yeah.  And then he went right back to his iPad and helping this,  this family.  And then he ignored you. 
[03:53:00]  Well,  I mean,  I wasn't going to try and try and push it because like,  I had to remember,  you know,  where I am and he's helping a family find a name.  Right.  So,  you know,  until he's done.  Yeah.  I just,  I just let him be on his way.  And,  you know,  I was with my wife and kids.  So,  so we eventually had to leave and,  and,  uh,  but I know where he is now.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to get down to that nine 11 Memorial and I'm not leaving until I have a conversation  with that guy because I love it.  And David with all my heart and there is no way that I can rest knowing that he'll never 
[03:53:30]  be back on this show.  I don't think so.  Do we have,  do we have a real quick,  cause there are people who don't know who intern David is.  Yeah.  I got,  uh,  I got a few,  like three minutes.  It's here.  The deal.  That's perfect.  Uh,  David would liquid ass David and a penthouse pet.  David doing kosher sports.  Let's see.  Maybe the penthouse pet.  What do you,  this one says intern David fantasy.  I could be funny.  David,  two girls,  one cup.  Intern David fantasy.  And that's only like,  he was never good at descriptions.  No,  no,  he would just stare at the TV and just look at it crooked. 
[03:54:00]  I go,  well,  his sports is pretty funny.  He goes,  Oh,  Hey,  yeah.  You go,  you go.  No,  no,  that's gross.  No,  that's disgusting.  No,  no,  no,  no.  His head would just swivel on his,  on his neck.  Except there'd always be the pause.  He'd cock his head and then he'd go,  David,  what do you think?  No,  no,  no,  no.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  Um,  he just won't stop calling.  Who?  Who is that?  Is that Bobo?  He's been calling.  Oh my God.  Since I came in here.  You gotta fucking be kidding me. 
[03:54:30]  Okay,  I guess.  Bobo.  I'm kidding.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  you asked me to call in.  I've been on the air this whole show.  I've been on the air since 6 a.m.  How could I have asked you to call in?  No,  they,  they,  they told,  they told me to,  they,  I got a call from the midterms.  They'd call,  call,  call in.  I swear.  Have you ever spoken,  have you ever called Bobo in your life?  Uh,  no,  he called the other day.  I answered the phone,  but that was,  I told him to call back that day.  Paul was even telling him to call back later in that day. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah.  I did not specify anything about today.  Bobo,  was this today?  Yeah,  some intern named Sal.  He's full of shit.  That is,  that is,  wow,  Sal,  he just said some intern named Sal.  I did not.  He's making that up,  dude.  I swear to God.  Now,  Bobo,  tell me this.  Did Sal call you and just say,  hey,  Bobo,  we need you to call the after show?  Yeah.  Sal,  why would you do that,  Sal?  I don't understand.  Eric,  this is news to me.  Do you have any discipline over your guys?  I had no idea this was even going on.  That's part of the problem.  I'm amazed.  Where did you get his number? 
[03:55:30]  I don't have his number.  It was an unknown number.  That's,  Sal,  you would be calling from an unknown number.  Bobo has the facts right.  Yeah.  Eric,  you don't know what's going on with your intern.  I was running the board for your show here.  I had no idea he was,  you know,  having private conversations with Bobo.  Bobo,  what time did this happen?  Not that long ago.  Okay,  how long?  Yeah,  exactly.  What time did it happen?  Yeah.  Not that long,  not that long ago.  Was it like 15 minutes ago?  It's a few seconds ago.  A few seconds ago.  A few seconds ago,  Sal was sitting in front of me in the studio. 
[03:56:00]  So you're lying.  Wait,  wait,  wait,  wait,  wait.  I got a call saying to call in.  Sal,  do you have a cell phone on you?  I do have a cell phone on you.  You son of a bitch!  You called Bobo in this studio,  right under my nose.  Let's look at his recents.  You know what?  I don't even want,  he's deleting him right now.  You just saw him.  Yes,  he deleted it.  He deleted it,  didn't he?  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  Sal,  you can't do that.  Bobo,  I don't know why Sal  thinks it's funny  to tell you to call in here,  especially when I'm looking right at him  and he's tricking me  because I didn't even hear a peep 
[03:56:30]  and his mic's on.  How'd he pull it off?  Must be some spy or something.  Are you a spy?  Partially.  You are?  Yes.  That's the afternoon gig?  Yeah.  Bobo,  do you think a partial spy could do this?  Yeah,  I think so.  He could be,  he could be an intern,  but also a spy.  He thinks so.  Yeah,  I think so too.  He's always like,  he's always like sneaking or something.  Wait,  tell me more.  It's just sneaking or something.  He's just like hiding around, 
[03:57:00]  like lurking,  lurking around or something.  He's like lurking,  uh,  using like some gadgets or something.  Like he's a,  he's a,  he's hiding,  he's in a fake ID or something.  He's got like,  he's got the fake IDs  and like a laser pin or something.  You know what I'm taking a picture of,  right?  You know what I'm taking a picture of,  right?  Who's with you,  Bobo?  Oh no,  that's just who my friend,  Kurt Lowe's.  Did he sleep over your house or something?  I just,  no,  no,  no,  no.  We were, 
[03:57:30]  we were trying to hold up signs in front of the court building.  Oh,  I'm sure.  You know what?  This is like,  do you remember the first hour of the show?  Yeah.  Do you remember?  I,  I,  what I said would happen?  Yup.  Bobo just in front of the court.  Well,  Bobo,  did you find the courthouse?  Yeah,  we did,  but my friend Kurt Lowe,  we got there late.  Cause he,  my friend Kurt Lowe was a drive.  Stop saying my friend Kurt Lowe.  We,  we arrived late.  Do you want to speak to Kurt Lowe?  No.  They want to talk to you.  No,  Bobo and Kurt Lowe were walking around up here yesterday. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  Uh,  Bobo,  uh,  and Kurt Lowe.  Are dating.  I don't know if they are dating.  Are they?  I think so.  That's the rumor.  They're with each other like every day.  Yeah.  Cause I know Bobo,  uh,  cause I guess Kurt Lowe lives in the same,  he's on Twitter and,  uh,  he's a big fan of the show.  Walk around with security.  He's a big fan of the show.  So he lives,  uh,  near Bobo.  And I guess Jennifer Hutt,  who does the show on Martha,  she's on Ron and Fez all the time.  She's the,  uh,  female who's,  uh, 
[03:58:30]  on Ron and Fez a lot.  She,  uh,  was doing a karaoke show yesterday.  Yeah.  And I guess they were doing it in the fishbowl.  And Bobo showed up to be in the audience of that show.  Like two hours before the show even started.  Yeah.  He was,  I,  I,  I was walking out of here around three 30 yesterday and Bobo was sitting by himself in front of the fishbowl studio,  empty chairs surrounding him.  And he said,  no,  they told us to get here around this time. 
[03:59:00]  I said,  Bobo,  there's no one else here.  The show starts at five.  It's three 30.  No,  no,  they told us.  I guess I'm the first one here over.  I mean,  I don't,  I don't know what happens.  Roland,  you gotta wake up.  Roland.  There's what I love about Roland and you can't even take it as an insult.  Roland was actually just,  he was sleeping.  Yeah.  Like you were asleep just now.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah.  No,  Roland,  if anybody else fell asleep while I was on the air,  it would kind of be a shot to, 
[03:59:30]  you know,  what fragile ego I have.  and unfortunately with Roland,  that doesn't happen because he will fall asleep while you are talking to him.  Eric,  you've had conversation with Roland while he,  and he falls asleep right there.  Yeah.  There'll be times where we're in the office and he'll say,  Oh,  do you think they'll,  they'll take this person?  I'll go,  well,  who is that?  And he'll start reading like their credentials.  And then he just kind of trails off and I'll turn around and go,  what?  And Roland's just kind of nodded out by the way.  Yeah.  I mean,  Roland,  it's a major medical issue. 
[04:00:00]  Like you can't fall asleep while people are talking to you.  I edit.  You edit?  You wait.  He's editing conversations.  I just catch the tail ends,  cut the middle out.  What were you going to say,  Eric?  I was just going to say,  and if you wake him up,  he'll just stare at you and then he'll throw something as hard as he can across the room going,  shut the fuck up.  I'm like,  you were the one who was talking.  There used to be a time when Roland would like protect himself and make sure nobody had him on video sleeping,  but he realized that he sleeps way too much for that. 
[04:00:30]  I mean,  listen,  you hear the show.  He gets guests in here regardless.  So it doesn't matter,  but it's just concerning.  This job gets done.  Paul got really excited the first day he came in like a couple of weeks ago to help us out.  Yeah.  And it was the first time he had met Roland and,  and he runs into my office and he's like,  Roland sleeping.  Do you want to like a video camera or a video tape?  I was like,  no,  I got,  I don't have a million pictures.  My phone's going to fill up.  What do I need another one for?  Paul,  and that's one of those classic like newbie mistakes. 
[04:01:00]  Like you're like,  you're like,  you're like,  I got it.  I got it.  I got a great bit.  Yeah,  we do it every day.  We're done with it already.  By the way,  a bunch of people on feedback,  Spano in New York and Joe in Long Island and a whole bunch of other people are asking,  Sam,  did you notice Bobo was talking like chip?  People are catching on.  Is that what he was doing?  The longest chip impression that anyone does.  Bobo doesn't understand the context.  He doesn't do the, 
[04:01:30]  he just goes,  something.  He does a great chip and he will go as long as you will allow him to.  Or something.  So I can't see the caller IDs anymore.  So that's the last time Bobo gets through today.  Yep.  Sal.  Yes.  You got to do me a favor.  Sure.  If I have you in here,  you have to leave your spy equipment out because I have to be able to trust you.  Was he lying or do you think Danny called him and said he was Sal? 
[04:02:00]  I know for a fact Danny did not call him.  Danny hates him.  Well,  hates a strong word.  I know.  I used it on purpose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rob Cross did it.  You think Rob Cross called and said,  Hey,  it's Sal,  the intern.  Call the after show.  Mm-hmm.  So he just made it up.  Did he hear me refer to him as Sal on the air just now?  No,  he's not that smart.  So what did he just dream?  He either dreamed it or his boyfriend,  Kurt Love called him.  Are they dating?  I think so.  It's weird.  They hang out a lot. 
[04:02:30]  They do.  He's so excited that he has a best friend.  Or maybe that's like a partner in the crime.  And he did keep saying,  My friend Kurt Love,  my friend Kurt Love.  Maybe they get married in a courthouse downtown.  That's why they were looking for a courthouse.  I mean,  they had a girl with them yesterday.  Yes.  But she was kind of paying a little more attention to you than she was to the other two.  Yeah.  She's been up here.  I think she hangs out with Kurt Love.  Yeah.  She's been up here a couple of times.  She was at the Hard Rock.  I saw her.  That's where I first met her.  Yeah.  She's a cool chick.  Yeah.  They're just friends like platonically though.  Yeah.  I mean,  I just know her from when she came up here. 
[04:03:00]  But you think Bobo and Kurt Love,  it doesn't seem as platonic?  They're always,  like Troy said,  they're just partners in crime.  He drove,  Kurt Love drove him today,  Bobo,  yesterday.  Bobo was very excited.  He didn't have to take the bus.  He drove him on Friday to his date.  Kurt Love did?  Yeah.  He drove him here.  And then he waited.  At six o'clock in the morning?  And then he waited until he was done at Dave and Buster's to drive him home.  Kurt Love may just see...  Is that true? 
[04:03:30]  As far as I know,  yes.  Wow.  Kurt Love may just see a good end to the show.  Yeah,  but he's not getting in.  But what I'm saying,  like he's trying to wiggle his way in.  You know what I mean?  You remember,  there were a couple,  like,  wannabe comedians  that would,  like,  convince a club  to let them on stage  if they got O&A plugs.  And then they would tell Bobo,  hey,  I got you a gig.  And then try to get Bobo to plug it on the air.  Yeah.  So,  I mean,  it wouldn't be the first time somebody's used Bobo,  but what would Kurt Love's ends be?  I think he just thinks he, 
[04:04:00]  maybe he needs a,  he's a character  and could be a,  like,  he wants to just be like a little,  like a show celebrity.  He wants to be down.  You know what I mean?  Like,  and he sees,  and look,  as much as everybody hates Bobo,  including everybody in this room.  I love him.  Bobo's down.  I mean,  he is down.  You got him,  even you,  Sal.  Yeah.  I mean,  he's down enough that you called him  right in front of my face  and told him to call the after show  for no reason.  I don't want Bobo's number in my phone.  Well,  because E-Rock has specified to me, 
[04:04:30]  don't give him your Twitter.  Don't give him your,  don't even tell him your last name.  He went as far to say that.  Well,  I mean,  one of us will give him your phone number  at some point.  That's how it goes.  The way he gets phone numbers is  he asks for somebody's phone number  and then we give him  someone else's phone number  pretending it is them.  I'm pretty sure that's how  we got Eric's phone number.  I don't know how we got Eric's phone number,  but I think that that's like,  he would call up and,  and Travis would say,  call me back on my cell  and then give him Eric's phone number.  Something like that.  How did he get Liam  from Talon's number?  Liam, 
[04:05:00]  I think gave it to him,  made the ultimate mistake  because he calls Liam all the time  and Liam is in his phone  as keeper of the XM  because Liam is the guy to contact  if you need an XM radio or something.  If like,  if Eric tells Bobo  that he's banned from the show,  he'll call Liam  and complain that somebody  banned him from the show.  Because he figures,  you know,  Liam does the booking.  So Liam can get him back.  So of course,  Liam's the guy to call.  It's just see,  it's just funny to see a retard  just spin out of control.  I don't think he's a retard.  No, me neither.  He's told me he isn't.  He's partially retarded.  He's admitted that he's partially retarded. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah,  but he's also admitted  that he's partially gay.  So I don't know how much  weight you can give that to.  Well,  he's done some gay shit,  dude.  Kurt Love.  They're dating.  Are they?  Are they?  I think.  It seems,  I mean,  the fact,  do you think Kurt Love  really waited here?  When he picked him up,  did he unlock the door for him?  Did he?  Did you see her?  I didn't see him.  You don't know for sure.  I didn't see him at all.  Bobo did make out with mustard.  That's true.  He did make out with mustard.  And,  Was that for the show?  And he had sex with his brother. 
[04:06:00]  That's true too.  So,  did you know that,  Sal?  Yeah,  Bobo and his brother  had sex.  That wasn't for the show.  Eric says that that  was not for the show.  That's just a pleasure thing.  Yeah.  So maybe he is.  I mean,  so,  if Kurt Love's gonna sit  in the city  for six hours,  literally six hours,  seven hours,  waiting for Bobo  to get done with his date.  Yeah,  he'll do crazy things.  He wants to be down.  I'm telling you.  Kurt Love will do crazy things.  I wonder how far  Kurt Love will go.  I mean,  Bobo has talked about 
[04:06:30]  getting some action  for a long time.  This could be  what he's looking for.  Listen.  He wants to lose his V-card.  Yeah,  he does,  and this could be  the way he gets it.
