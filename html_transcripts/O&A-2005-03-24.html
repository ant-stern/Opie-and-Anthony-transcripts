<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy segment devoted to sexually explicit voicemail messages left by Pat O'Brien, detailing graphic sexual encounters.  Listener-created remixes of these tapes were played extensively.  The discussion then broadened to include additional allegations against O'Brien, such as using a homophobic racial slur and attempting to flirt with Oprah Winfrey, inspiring further humorous remixes.  The hosts briefly touched upon their upcoming vacation, their declining popularity (according to InsideRadio.com), and the low call volume that day.  A significant portion of the show detailed their encounter with Robert Plant, focusing on the comedically awkward attempts by Opie and Anthony, along with their assistant Jimmy, to obtain photos with the rock legend. This involved frantic interactions with XM staff and resulted in humorous anecdotes and conflict between Opie and Norton over the success of their respective photographic efforts and the online popularity of the resulting images.  Norton also promoted his upcoming HBO special, referring to the audience as "fruit monkeys."  Technical issues with the studio equipment and a visit from a technician were also mentioned, along with upcoming live shows in Boston.

The show then segued into a discussion about the Terry Schiavo case, playing audio of Schiavo and making crude and vulgar comments about the sounds. The hosts speculated on the meaning of the audio, including the suggestion that it said "kill me, you ass" when played backward. This segment also incorporated a Bill Hicks bit about using terminally ill people as stuntmen. A significant portion involved a studio visit from Stalker Patty, featuring vulgar and sexually explicit conversations between the hosts, Patty, and several female guests, including members of the band Eroktica, who were brought into the studio.  The hosts made sexually suggestive comments towards the women, encouraging sexual acts between them and with Patty, who remained largely uncomfortable.  Listener-submitted remixes of Pat O'Brien's sex tapes and the Terry Schiavo audio were also played. The conversation shifted to New York City's declining crime rate, before culminating in the Eroktica band members and Stalker Patty nearly disrobing in the studio.

A chaotic in-studio event followed, featuring multiple women, including strippers or performers from E-Rocktica and Patty. The hosts encouraged the women to disrobe, culminating in several becoming completely nude.  Significant effort was made to coax Patty into participating, including suggestive comments and physical interactions. Crystal, who throws sex parties, promoted her email address, sexxxclub.yahoo.com.  A self-proclaimed carny performed a face-sitting act on Jimmy.  The segment included numerous instances of explicit sexual language and descriptions of sexual acts, with attempts to get the women to have an orgasm on-air, which was successful. A caller recounted a story about a midget in a restroom, followed by a listener-submitted story about their deceased dog, Murphy, triggering discussions about the hostsâ€™ pets and experiences with pet loss. A listener called in, and Jim Norton called in to complain about his coffee.

Finally, the show featured a humorous anecdote about Opie and Anthony withdrawing $20,000 from a joint bank account during Anthony's divorce, only to find that his estranged wife had already withdrawn most of the funds.  This was followed by "What Did We Learn?" listener calls, featuring humorous and often crude observations, many referencing the Terry Schiavo case, Jim Norton's HBO special, and warnings about file-sharing programs for tax documents.  Jimmy Norton was a guest in the studio, promoting his HBO special and discussing his upcoming vacation, with Bob Kelly mentioned as his fill-in. The segment was replete with vulgar language and sexually explicit references.

[00:10:00]  Drugs.  Fuck.  Come.  Fuck.  Drugs.  We cannot.  Poor hookers.  We cannot get enough of the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  He totally loses it at the end of that.  Yeah.  Like he loses it.  He can't.  He was kind of doing a good job with, I want to do this to you and that.  And then at the end, it's just like, yeah, you come up, hookers.  And then he's just throwing words out.  Hookers.  Fuck.  You.  Drugs.  Coke.  Coke.  Fuck.  You know what happens?  Ass.  Eat.  Fuck.  You know what happened?  I've been studying these tapes since we started playing them.  Studying?  Yeah.  I'm studying this whole thing. 
[00:10:30]  It just amazes me.  He just ran out of things he wanted to do with her.  I know.  That's what the problem was.  Well, you know, there is only so much you can do.  Right.  Unless you're Jimmy.  That would be interesting.  I should have shit on my chest.  Piss in my mouth.  New things can be added in.  This guy, what a rookie.  Oh, my God.  That's all right.  Fuck.  Suck.  That's pretty much it.  You know, what are you going to do?  I want to tickle behind your kneecap.  Yeah, that's good.  Well, then her and Betsy make out, so he does kind of like go back the other way. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, he kind of, he tried, but, eh, I don't think he pulled it off.  He tried to bring the romance back just a little bit.  The romance.  The romance.  After saying how he wanted to jerk off in her face, then he brings it back a little bit.  I want you to have a miscarriage and then spoon with Betsy.  Betsy.  Poor Betsy.  You know, we've been doing a lot of interviews in there.  Well, what's the difference between regular radio and satellite radio?  Yeah.  Answer the Pat O'Brien sex tapes. 
[00:11:30]  That pretty much sums it up.  Because no one is having fun like we are with these things.  No one.  And now the listeners and our interns, they're all starting to make their own versions of the sex tapes.  Remember we encouraged that yesterday, Anthony?  Only on this show do you have the forum to, at home, your own recording equipment, take some of these clips, throw them together, send them to us, and we actually play it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Only on this program.  Here's the problem.  We go on vacation after tomorrow. 
[00:12:00]  Yep.  So if you want in on this quick little bit that we've been doing the last few days, you've got to start hustling and get it into us, okay?  Last show before vacation tomorrow.  Tomorrow, and I think the audio, the sex tapes audio for now is up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com.  Right.  But Danny, our own intern, came up with this.  Listen to this one.  Save message Sunday, 9.04 p.m.  You're so fucking hot.  I have a big cock.  I want you to suck it.  I told Betsy, Betsy's so jealous. 
[00:12:30]  If you agree with this, when I see you, walk by me in the hallway, don't punch me in the face.  I want to get Betsy, and then just pick up Jane Mansfield's head and eat it.  If you're into this, just breathe while you're in the office.  I just want to put white powder in an envelope and dump it in your face and fuck you all.  Betsy, let's eat the hooker's ass.  If you want to suck my cock, just look at me stupidly and kind of half-smile.  That was a Shibo reference, I remember.  Jane Mansfield's head and eat it. 
[00:13:00]  Bravo, Danny.  Bravo.  That is sexy.  Hey, just a quick question.  Are the phones working today?  We usually have the phones just lit by now.  Wow.  They are.  They're working.  So maybe Inside Radio is right about us.  We have disappeared from radio.  We've disappeared from radio.  According to InsideRadio.com, you know, the problem is there's a ton of people out there  that just don't want to see Anthony and I succeed again.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  And InsideRadio.com took a nice little shot at us yesterday.  They were talking about Howard Stern.  They say, Howard Stern's biggest fear, that he'll disappear on satellite radio.  Think about it.  It's pretty much happened with Opie and Anthony on XM.  We've disappeared.  Ooh.  We're not here?  We're not here.  We're not growing every day.  We're not doing, you know, interviews for pretty much every newspaper in America on a weekly basis.  What happened? 
[00:14:00]  We weren't just on CBS Sunday morning.  What happened?  A couple weeks back.  I thought we were doing a good job.  And now we're going to take it to the next level after vacation.  You know, we're getting off the premium.  Off this damn premium.  I cannot wait for that.  That's going to take the show to the new level that we talk about.  We didn't broadcast to 500-plus listeners on St. Paddy's Day?  That didn't happen?  I guess not.  But according to the people at InsideRadio.com.  No, according to one asshole at InsideRadio. 
[00:14:30]  They've written about us.  That's the odd thing.  They say we've disappeared.  But you could go back and look at, there's been numerous articles InsideRadio has written about us since we've been on satellite.  What?  Are we disappeared?  But you're writing about us.  I think there's one guy, you know, the Stern fans, the hardcore Stern fans don't really like us, Opie.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We have to deal with that.  So, you know, obviously this guy's got a little bit of an agenda. 
[00:15:00]  He's doing a Stern story and he figures he's not throwing a jab in.  Howard, look what I did.  Did you see what I wrote?  Yeah.  Next call.  Yeah, you just watch what happens with us.  Right.  Click.  You just watch what happens with us in XM.  You just keep watching.  Watch now.  All right.  Anthony, then the listener started sending in there, Pat O'Brien, sex tape, remixes.  I want to play one from Joe that came in late last night.  Is it sexy?  Yeah, it's very sexy.  Sexy. 
[00:15:30]  He definitely sexed his version up here.  Listen to this.  This guy cannot control himself.  He's got to call this woman and tell her.  Let's get crazy.  Let's go.  God, you're so fucking hot.  I'm so fucking in you.  It's incredible.  To make you come.  I'm so fucking in you.  But I want to fucking make it crazy. 
[00:16:00]  You're so fucking hot.  And this is what I'll do.  I want to fucking eat you and fuck you.  And suck your tits.  And I want to make it real.  I want to sex you up.  I fucking want to fucking make it crazy.  I want to make it real. 
[00:16:30]  Sex you up.  Sex you up.  The worst part is I think she's fucking a girl named Betsy.  I want her to knit a flag and I'll eat your cunt.  God damn.  That is great.  How embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  Joe, good job.  We could just talk about this all day.  I love the Pat O'Brien tapes.  We're giddy as is because vacation's right around the corner. 
[00:17:00]  We could just do this thing all day long.  Pat O'Brien.  Yeah.  The other news stations, the news station's been hitting on it, but they can't play it.  No.  That's the beauty of the satellite.  Yeah.  You can just play this and it doesn't matter.  People love it.  It takes away when you got a bleep.  Imagine how many times we'd have to bleep that.  It would be awful.  To listen to it just bleeped.  Well, Anthony, the story gets better. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, no.  I can't possibly.  The story gets better.  Give the recap.  Well, Pat O'Brien was leaving these messages on this girl's machine.  Sexually explicit.  You heard him here.  And then it got a little worse.  We reported that there's a photograph.  Yeah, the girl, I guess Betsy, has this ex-husband who has possession of a photo of Pat O'Brien jacking.  Just a picture of a glistening, sweaty Pat O'Brien with dick in hand, getting down to business. 
[00:18:00]  And that picture's probably going to be making the round soon in the tabloids somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah.  But you're saying now it gets a little worse?  Well, yes.  According to the Daily News, the gossip column called Gate Crasher.  This guy, Ben.  The guy who writes Gate Crasher.  Ben does the gossip column? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, Ben Whitcomb.  Access Hollywood battle on.  We should probably leave poor old Pat O'Brien alone, but the stories keep coming.  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh, Jesus.  And he would say this to her face.  Are you kidding me?  Or to his face.  Excuse me, his face.  To his face. 
[00:19:00]  He would say this to his face.  A source tells us he used to refer to a gay African-American senior producer at Access Hollywood as the fruit monkey.  Oh.  This guy just lost his mind.  He was probably just doing coke and drinking during...  Yeah.  You, Betsy, me, and the fucking fruit monkey.  Get him in here.  I want to fuck the fruit monkey in the ass.  You eat Betsy.  I want the fruit monkey to climb a tree and pound a banana into my anus. 
[00:19:30]  Follow his nose.  It always knows.  That's the latest today.  The fruit monkey.  Oh, I'm sure now all allegations are going to be coming out about him.  A lot of former staffers probably going to start coming out and saying, yeah, this guy's a farang.  There's also, um, in the same thing, they talk about how he was hitting on Oprah Winfrey as well.  Ugh. 
[00:20:00]  He does deserve to be in rehab.  I guess he was at...  How drunk do you have to be to try to hit on that?  I guess he was at the Four Seasons in L.A., saw Oprah Winfrey at the bar.  Uh...  Oprah Winfrey walks into a bar.  I fucked her.  Me and Betsy and the fruit monkey.  I guess he went up to Oprah Winfrey.  She's the fat monkey, I call her.  Went up to Oprah Winfrey in the bar and was starting to flirt with her and try to pick her up.  Right.  And she didn't go for it.  Yeah. 
[00:20:30]  Obviously.  So, I hope all the stories get out before we go on vacation.  Oh, please.  We're going to be reading about that on vacation.  Going, damn it!  Really?  Why aren't we on the air?  We're going to have to call up.  Me and you will call the studio and do a little break from our vacations.  It's like, turn on the station!  Turn it on, we've got to talk about this.  Turn on the channel, we need to talk about this now.  All right, then, while we were on a train back from Washington yesterday, Anthony, our  own Derek came up with a little remix. 
[00:21:00]  Ooh!  Took the Pat O'Brien sex tapes and came up with this.  Saved message, Sunday, 7.09 p.m.  Hey, it's me.  I know what's wrong with me and why I'm like this.  But I want to fucking...  I want to fucking go crazy with you.  I'm so fucking into you.  You're so fucking hot.  I don't want to lick your pussy.  I'm going to make you cum.  You suck your tips. 
[00:21:30]  I don't want to fucking make you fucking crazy.  Look at me and say yes.  Say yes, I'll wait.  Look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, let's go.  I don't want you badly.  I know you want me.  Let's just fucking have fun.  Forget this.  That's it. 
[00:22:00]  Just go out in the bathroom and we can't push it out.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go crazy with you.  Listen up.  Look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it,  look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look for it, look 
[00:22:30]  Hey, fruit monkey, I want to fuck you in the ass while you bang cymbals together and smile.  If you want to do this with me, can you just swing from your tail and throw shit at my face? 
[00:23:00]  Monkey.  I want you and four friends to drag me out of my semi-rig and beat me with a sink in the middle of the street.  I want to walk up to you in a train and shoot you a few times.  Motherfucker. 
[00:23:30]  Let's just get nuts.  Let's just get crazy.  If I ask for five bucks, I'll paralyze you.  It just gets better and better.  Oh, God.  What a creep.  There is no other word.  What is your major malfunction, fruit monkey?  Your name's fruit monkey.  A banana in your footlocker. 
[00:24:00]  I just want you and Betsy to tie me up and put a whole blanket over me and beat me with soap and a sock.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  What an ass.  What a complete.  That's fantastic.  Ass.  He's a classic.  He really is a classic.  Great.  He would say it right to his face.  Hey, fruit monkey.  No one says it right to someone's face ever. 
[00:24:30]  And he probably had a smile and like, yeah, yes, okay, Pat.  Deal with a Pat O'Brien.  What a horny guy.  That's some fantastic stuff.  We'll see what comes out in the future on Pat O'Brien.  I think his job's in jeopardy.  You think?  He's still on their website, the Insider website.  They have him on there with his bio and his bio lists, all of his credits and how long he's been in the business.  Well.  His long career, which ends now. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Well, it's controversy.  Controversy sells.  Of course, they're going to keep it up there for a while.  And then.  Because everyone's searching out any info they can on Pat O'Brien now.  They have his statement that he made.  Oh.  Thanking his fans.  Oh, really?  And saying that he's entering rehab.  And that he wants to get back to work as quickly as possible.  I'm sure he does.  Good luck with that one.  Yeah, that ain't happening anytime soon, huh?  Oof.  This isn't something you could just walk out of rehab and go back to work. 
[00:25:30]  How do you put that suit on and sit there and talk about Britney Spears gaining a little weight or any of the other inane celebrity stories when you're the biggest story?  You know?  I didn't see anything on the Insider website about his story.  You know they all are sitting there going, oh, my God, I want to dig into this.  We want to do this story.  You know they're doing it on Entertainment Tonight and all the other ones.  With that wacky voice lady.  Weep, weep, weep, weep. 
[00:26:00]  Maybe now he'll be honest on the show.  Talk honestly.  Nah.  Maybe just look at the camera.  If you want to fuck me, just call.  Write.  Do something.  Britney Spears put a little weight on it.  Seems like there's a little more jiggler to step.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd still eat her ass after the workout.  Me, Patsy, the fruit monkey.  We all get together.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Calling the fruit monkey.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone. 
[00:26:30]  I've got this feeling.  So appealing.  For us to get together and sing.  Fuck, fuck.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Stick it up your ass.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding.  Banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping.  Banana phone. 
[00:27:00]  It's no baloney.  It ain't a phony.  My cellular.  Banana phone.  Ah, let's go to the phones.  I love the Banana phone song.  So do I.  Let's talk to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  You're killing me.  Just a little nugget for you.  I think we need to go in the direction of the fruit monkey and the chimps that ate the  guy's ass in general.  I want you to bite my fingers off, tear my lips off, eat half of my ass. 
[00:27:30]  Get up, guys.  Good vacation.  All right, thanks, Joe.  Could you bite Betsy's thumb off first?  I'll push her away and you can eat my ass.  Fruit monkey.  Oh, wow.  He's insane.  He really is.  Scott in Wisconsin.  What's up, Scott?  Yeah, I think that guy, great show, by the way, but I think he's a little manic depressive.  A little manic?  Yeah, when you're like that, you get those feelings like that, that you're, you know,  you're God and you can fuck anything like that. 
[00:28:00]  Dude, that had booze and Coke written all over it.  Yeah.  Those phone calls.  You don't make those unless you are so drunk and coked out.  You're missing one.  What?  Booze, Coke, Viagra.  You think of his sitting there with a big heart on, too?  Big raging purple one just pulsating.  Pulsating and damn things mocking him.  Laughing at him that there's no chick there.  Right.  Come on, call again, asshole.  It's only been three minutes.  I can't sit here in your lap all fucking day. 
[00:28:30]  All right, cock.  His penis is talking to him.  His dick is talking to him.  What are you doing?  Like Anthony Hopkins in that movie Magic.  Oh, the puppet turns around.  Come on, asshole.  Pick up the phone.  I'm trying.  I'm trying to get this together.  What are you doing?  I'm calling.  I'm calling this chick.  I'm trying to wheel and deal with Betsy.  You're not closing the deal, stupid.  All right, I'll call again.  Look, I want to fuck you.  My cock wants to fuck you.  I don't know what to do.  Jesus Christ.  I'll call the fruit monkey. 
[00:29:00]  Keep the fruit monkey out of this, faggot.  His cock.  His big raging heart on sitting in his lap taunting.  I must blame my penis, ladies and gentlemen.  If you're into this, bite Betsy's thumbs off.  His little coat.  I love it.  Well, there you have it.  The start of another Open Anthony program.  Yeah, we're hoping the listeners come up with a few more before we go on vacation tomorrow. 
[00:29:30]  We've got to get anything quick.  Yeah, you've really got to work fast now.  All right.  Psyched.  A little vacation.  We've been on the go for quite a while.  Yeah.  Like seven to eight months straight.  Yeah.  Because we did that whole promotional tour as well.  We need a little time.  Oh, you can just feel it.  You can just feel it.  First of all, I've had it with New York.  You know, hey, I love the city, whatever.  Can we take a break and then we talk about that?  Oh, but I've had it.  I know.  I know what you're going to say.  Because we're going to talk about your... 
[00:30:00]  I forget what I'm going to say.  No, no, no.  You'll be fine.  In the 30 seconds that we have to break.  I know.  We're fixing all that.  By the time we get back from vacation...  That's getting fixed, too.  Yeah, we're going to take this whole thing to the next level.  So, we'll talk about meeting Robert Plant.  It did happen.  Talk about our commute back from Washington.  Washington, Jim Norton had the only empty seat for a while.  Wow, really?  Oh, yeah.  We'll get into a lot of stuff.  And wait, wait.  I have my HBO information, which I have to give out for people who want tickets to the shows. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  We'll do that next time.  Thank you.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I like it as much as the next guy.  This is really funny stuff.  But are we now alleging that this is Pat O'Brien?  I miss it.  I miss it's playing him as well.  I miss it's playing it.  Yeah, but he can't play him like we're playing him.  Yeah, I got to edit all the fun stuff out.  Use it to manage.  Bleeps and bloops.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Here's Pat O'Brien talking about a boop job. 
[00:31:00]  That stinks.  Wish I was on that.  Satellite.  Satellite.  I'm no dummy.  Oh, sorry.  Talk to me like that.  I miss it.  Yeah, yeah, satellite.  You were right.  I'm a dick.  Boy, I like to eat your pussy.  You can't suck my cock.  I'll lick your tits.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  Yeah, so just wink at me.  Wait, no. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I'm walking by.  If I tip my cowboy hat at you, it means I want to fuck you.  I miss it in the morning.  Jesus, dude, that's a really good impression.  When I have my, look, I want to jiggle my turkey neck at you.  All right, look, I'm going to teabag you.  And my testes hang real low because I'm an old man.  And if you want that, just wink at me, baby.  Because I want to lick that pussy and suck those tits, baby. 
[00:32:00]  Baby.  Bobby Worms coming to get you.  I want to do a Billy Saul Hargis bit while you suck my cock.  Bobby Worms coming to get you out of my pants.  Bobby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  The Bobby and Anthony Show.  XM202.  It's good to be back in New York. 
[00:32:30]  Well, it's good to be back in our own studio.  Kind of like that, you know.  I think that's why they want us to go to Washington sometimes.  They sent us down there to screw some stuff up so that we feel better about coming back here.  You know, it's like a psychological thing they're doing with us.  But I've had it.  Had it with the winter. 
[00:33:00]  I know, you're probably sitting there in, where, Miami somewhere.  Phoenix, sitting up there in Sierra Mountains drinking champagne, what?  Champagne cocktails.  Yeah, you know, you're wherever.  It's nice and warm.  I've had it.  This winter is just never ending.  Never ending.  We're into spring now.  A couple of days into spring.  And we had snow here again.  I walked out this morning and went, oh, my God.  I'm just covered with snow everywhere. 
[00:33:30]  Driving on ice again.  The commute takes forever.  Yesterday for the train, I got into Penn Station here in New York City.  Three o'clock.  Three in the afternoon.  My drive that takes me 20 minutes in the morning with no traffic.  It's a 20-minute drive from my house, door to door.  Yesterday, two hours.  Two hours on that LIE.  Two hours.  Were you annoyed?  Annoyed.  Annoyed.  Have you ever driven with him?  You know something? 
[00:34:00]  I have gotten much better because now I just, I'm beaten.  I'm a beaten man.  I sit there and just, I slump in my seat.  I'm just kind of, oh, well, here I am again.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  On Star should have a feature that you can press the button and a bunch of A-10 warthogs sweep down like the highway of death in Kuwait.  Wait and just clear the way for you because it's somebody screwing it up.  I don't care.  They say it's volume, this, that, or the other thing.  It's got, there are people screwing up the flow of traffic. 
[00:34:30]  Well.  It was snowing a little, a little sleet, but nothing sticking on the ground.  Well.  Drive.  But that makes people all slow down about 10, 15 miles an hour.  Yeah.  To start.  Right.  And then that just.  Right off the top.  And then that just backs everyone up.  You only live 20 miles from home.  17, something like that.  17 miles from home and it took you two hours.  Mm-hmm.  Dude, I get here in 20 minutes.  I know.  It's nothing.  The drive, Crosstown, Crosstown, in its, alone took just about 45 minutes. 
[00:35:00]  And that, kids, in the morning, it takes me, literally, I'm not saying like, oh, it's two minutes.  Two minutes.  It's two minutes when I make the turn to go Crosstown and end up here.  It, 45 minutes.  Because people just decide they want to pull into an intersection, even though they know  they're not going to make it across before the light turns red for them.  And then you get to look at the side of their vehicle with their stupid face through the  window.  And no matter what curses you're throwing or racial epithets or horns you're beeping, they 
[00:35:30]  never turn and look at you.  So you can flip them the bird.  They never give me the satisfaction.  I swear I want to weld a piece of railroad track to my bumper and just go at them at  about 60 miles an hour and watch their head explode on the passenger window.  I would just, ha, ha, ha.  I would laugh so hard as the cops are hauling me away.  Just giggling.  There you go.  Old pulp head won't be in the intersection anymore. 
[00:36:00]  New York, that was my day yesterday after I got back from Washington.  I've had it with New York.  I'm so ready for a vacation.  Yeah, we're all ready.  I'm going to be the guy on the deck chair with the sun and do a little sweeping pan of  the ship and then pull away in the glistening blue waters of the Caribbean.  There I am, no longer stuck in traffic.  I need it bad.  What a weird winter, though.  I mean, we were in Washington, it got up to almost 70 degrees, but we've been so beaten 
[00:36:30]  here in New York this winter that I still went out with a winter coat and a winter hat  on.  Yeah.  I just couldn't comprehend that it might be warm out.  No.  You know?  And then, God, it went from 65, let's say, in Washington all the way down.  65?  When we were down there the first day to the second day.  Was that warm?  It was way up there.  I think you're just doing relative temperature.  Really?  It was way up there.  It seemed warm because we've been so fucked over here. 
[00:37:00]  And then just, bam, right back to winter here in New York, so.  Thanks.  Anthony, you left early after the show yesterday?  Yeah, I tried to get home early.  You got right out.  Yeah, what time did you get home?  Um, my train left at noon, right?  Noon.  My train pulled out at noon.  I was home by five.  We left two hours later?  Yeah.  We walked in the door the same time, my friend.  There you go.  The same time.  Isn't that great?  And you were stuck in traffic for two hours.  Mm-hmm.  We were stuck waiting for Norton to get his celebrity photo for two hours. 
[00:37:30]  Yes.  Everybody is wondering, did Jimmy get his Robert Plant photo?  There was some fun involved with the whole process, but in general, he's a raving lunatic.  We've brought this up on many occasions on the show.  I don't care what he's going to say, well, at least I got the picture.  I would have to say, yeah, but at what price?  The end justifies the means.  At what price?  I mean, everyone at XM now thinks you're completely insane.  Too bad.  And here's the thing, and the term is, at least we got the picture. 
[00:38:00]  See?  We?  Ah.  You threw me under the bus.  Are you kidding me?  Dude.  Are you kidding me?  Oh, you're going to lose this one.  When he walked out of the studio after we watched him from six feet away, which was very,  very cool.  All of a sudden, they go, hey, guys, you want to watch him do his, whatchamacallit there,  the soundcheck?  Well, yeah.  So Jimmy and I walk into where we did that Artist Confidential thing.  Yep.  We are six feet from Robert Plant as he's working it out with the band, the new songs,  which kind of sounded cool.  I would like to maybe play one on the air. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, we can't play it?  The album's not out yet.  May 10th.  But isn't the single out at this point?  Don't they usually do that?  No?  I believe the single's not even out yet.  Oh, all right.  Well, look at the...  I checked yesterday, so Jim, we checked yesterday.  So Jim could plug the album on our show yesterday, remember?  Yeah.  Because Jim wanted to be very positive.  So we're sitting six feet from Robert Plant.  Yeah.  And first of all, you can't get over the fact that he probably has the biggest skull I've  ever seen in my life.  His head is so fucking huge. 
[00:39:00]  He does have a very big head.  If you open his mouth far enough, you can see a lit candle.  Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, like a big, huge pumpkin head.  His head, how big was his head?  Mammoth.  It's like two of yours, Anthony, easily.  A really big head.  Easily.  And I'm sitting there.  I remember I was talking about someone that I would like to meet that would just freak  me out.  Yep.  And I said it would be Robert Plant.  That's a biggie.  It's Zeppelin.  Come on.  I'm sitting there just observing the whole scene thinking, you know what?  We're all just the same on this planet. 
[00:39:30]  Of course, it's Robert Plant.  Yes, it is Robert Plant.  And he sang with Zeppelin and all that crap.  But you're looking at the guy and you're thinking, oh, God, he's out of shape.  He's got baloney tits.  His head's too big for his body.  There's no one actually special in this world.  He can't even take care of himself, Anthony.  You were really noticing the up-close imperfections.  Oh, my God.  With all the money he's made over the years, you'd think he might have gotten a trainer.  Because, you know, he, I think, secretly still wants to be that sex symbol, even though 
[00:40:00]  he's pushing 60.  Yeah.  But he's got the baloney tits showing through his little sweater.  And he's trying to make some sexy moves as he's singing with the band.  Was he making sexy moves?  Well, who was sitting in front of him?  Me and Ope at first.  That's it?  Was he making sexy moves to you guys?  It was kind of a little weird.  Was he doing all those Robert Plant, like, little pelvis thrust things at you guys?  Oh, if there's a bustle in your head, Roe, just wink at me and then eat Betsy's ass.  And he's got the tight jeans on, but, you know, like the old days, he's got a good presentation, 
[00:40:30]  right?  Is his hog there like the old days?  Oh, it's there, but now it's a lot closer to the knee.  What?  Do you think gravity's kind of pulling his hog down?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm thinking, you know what?  When it all comes down to it, he's not that much more special than anyone.  He's just an old guy up there doing his thing.  Trying to do his thing.  I mean, his voice still sounds pretty cool.  Did it sound good?  Did he sound good?  I thought so. 
[00:41:00]  Very good.  He sounded really good.  I thought so, because I heard him years ago trying to do some Zeppelin stuff, and it  was just an abomination, but maybe he was having an off day.  Well, he can't hit those high notes anymore, but he still has a pretty cool voice for the  stuff he's doing now.  Yeah.  And so after the show, you left, and then it was, I don't know, two straight hours of  Jimmy just obsessing.  Conspiring to try to get this picture.  I heard he bothered everybody at XM.  Everybody.  I bothered.  Jamie is a great, great person. 
[00:41:30]  We've worked with her on the road.  She's just like, you could tell she wanted just Jimmy to go away.  You know why?  Also, I know when I left, I walked right past the studio, and they were setting up for  this thing, and I've never seen so many people in that building, and so much equipment.  They were moving stuff in.  They had a separate mixing board for him that was, it was the size of a couch.  Massive.  This thing was huge, and they're bringing that, and they're hooking stuff up.  XM people running around like crazy. 
[00:42:00]  So they were probably all very busy, Jimmy, and I think your priority was your picture.  Well, they weren't all busy.  I wasn't, I would go up to Lee Evans, Lee Abrams.  Lee Evans, I know.  I was just looking at, it's funny, I wrote Lee Evans here, too, and I know it's Lee Evans.  Lee, who's the nicest guy at XM, and he's just sitting in his office, stoned, and just  irritated every time I put my face.  No, you don't understand.  You peek in, and everybody's just like, hi, Lee.  And I can't do this justice. 
[00:42:30]  I just can't.  I mean, Norton was pacing.  You know how big that place is.  He would go down to where the plan's going to be, then all the way upstairs and talk  to Lee, back down and make sure the plan didn't show up.  Did you go out and see his bus?  No, no, I didn't.  His bus is out in the parking lot.  It was a band's bus.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he buys a private plane, please.  He's not on a bus.  Yeah, he, he, uh.  Actually, by the way, just so you know, Robert took the Xela, the 3 o'clock Xela, up to  New York because his plane couldn't take off.  So he was on the next Xela train after we took.  Wow, really?  So we could have rode with him, yeah.  Well, we couldn't have rode with him. 
[00:43:00]  He was in first class probably with a guy.  How did Bobby Plant get his privacy on a train?  He couldn't, they couldn't, there was problems flying into New York, so he didn't, he didn't  fly his jet.  Yeah, because of the, uh.  Yeah, so.  But, I mean, Norton was just pacing, and I'm like, you know, we want to eat because we're  starving, because, you know, we've been up since whatever, 4.30 in the morning, and  oh, no, no, no, no, we can't, we can't risk it.  Risk what?  He's not here.  Everyone's telling me he's coming here at 12.30.  Ah, no one knows what the fuck's going on.  Remember that one, Ben? 
[00:43:30]  That's exactly right.  No one knows, nobody knows, I've asked three people now, nobody knows.  I asked three people, got three different answers, no one knows what the fuck's going  on.  Because what happens is this.  And then, I didn't, well, I didn't say you couldn't eat, I didn't say you couldn't eat.  That's why he's still behind the scenes, but then he goes into Lee's office, hey Lee,  so what's the deal, you think this will happen?  And Lee's like, well, with anyone else I can guarantee it, but with him, he's like,  I don't know, his guys are very protective, he's a tough one.  They had gotten a no.  They had called him, Jamie was so nice, had called and asked and gotten a no.  Of course.  From the management. 
[00:44:00]  If you ask, they're going to say no.  So, I was like, look, this is a brutal one.  And even Lee said, this is a tough one to get, man.  And so I was going to plan it out and get it right.  And I kept popping into his office and asking him, he's like, well, you can walk down with  me when I go down there.  Oh my God, they must have been so annoyed.  No, they weren't.  They weren't annoyed.  No, they were.  You could see that they were annoyed.  They weren't going to tell you they were annoyed.  Let them be annoyed, who cares?  Because you're a big star for XM, and they're like, oh God.  And Jamie's trying to worry about the green room and making sure everything's going to run 
[00:44:30]  smoothly.  And he's just pestering and picking and pestering.  I'm telling you, he's a different person when this whole thing goes down.  Everybody talks shit until it comes time to get their photo.  But at what price is what I'm saying.  I'm telling you right now, the next time we're in this situation, we have to have Steve just  follow you with a camera, because I can't do this story justice.  Now, I've seen it before.  I saw the Metallica.  I saw you yesterday.  You looked like Mark David Chapman down there waiting outside the studio store.  He looks like he's going to be a problem, like he does in his act. 
[00:45:00]  He really looks like he's the one that's going to be the problem.  But it's because.  And then he shows me the camera and goes, you know, you might have to take the picture.  So I know this sounds stupid, but the big button, that's the one you push.  They've got to train you.  I'll tell you why.  And then it goes like this.  He pulls it out.  He's like, and don't panic.  Here, we'll.  Here, we'll.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Here, we'll try a practice shot right here.  No, did you do practice photos?  Dude, you hit the wall.  You're forgetting the important part.  You hit halfway, and then the wall lit up where the, you know, the flash, the orange thing  happens.  And then he goes, and then click.  That's all he has to do.  He's forgetting when I said you might have to take the picture.  He goes, no, I can't do that. 
[00:45:30]  I can't do that.  I asked you to take a picture.  He goes, because I can't do that.  Why can't you do that?  You're a grown man.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why.  He knows he wasn't even there.  I was given the camera to take the picture of you and Ozzy, and I threw my hands up and  said, I ain't taking this picture.  There is no way I want the pressure and stress of taking a picture for you, Jimmy.  I would never take a picture.  Dude, God forbid.  You're right.  Something happened.  That was different, though.  You and I were in studio together here.  He wanted a photo with Clint.  He was nervous. 
[00:46:00]  You were nervous.  I was nervous, but more nervous that you would be so freaked out if I missed it.  Dude, I'm telling you.  I don't lie to you.  No one wants the stress or pressure of taking one of your pictures, Jim.  When there's a photo opportunity here, nobody.  You can ask all these guys.  Nobody wants to take the photo, girl.  They're petrified that you're going to shoot them if it gets messed up.  It's like telling the Fuhrer the Panzers aren't available.  You don't want to tell them.  I don't want to tell them.  I would just put my head down and have a little teardrop.  This is how psychotic he is.  We were at OzFest in Philly, and I was backstage helping him get some of his pictures back in the day. 
[00:46:30]  And I was the one who took the picture of Rob Zombie.  That's probably on your website.  Okay.  And it was in front of a glass door.  Yeah.  The picture's perfect, except there's a glare in the middle of them.  A little glare.  Because a little glare from the flash.  That doesn't take away from seeing Rob Zombie and Norton.  Uh-huh.  And you fucking freaked out on him.  I didn't think I was mad at you.  Well, he's like, well, I guess I can fix this in Photoshop.  I don't know.  I did.  I thought about that.  I did.  Which he did.  He got rid of the flash, because it has to be perfect.  Yeah.  No, it just went, there's a big flash in the middle. 
[00:47:00]  Actually, it's funny you should say that, but when I was taking your picture, I'll tell  you what happened.  After you blew me off, because you got yours done.  Didn't blow you off at all.  Why couldn't you say one more picture, Robert?  First of all, I didn't speak to Robert.  Jamie did.  Jamie.  And I got to thank, before we do this, I got to thank these people, man.  Wait, you got some music?  Because the list of people he has to thank is very, very long.  Can we get some Ray from Long Island quickly?  Yeah, we're not all that different.  He wrote Stairway to Heaven.  You forced a cripple to shove a dildo in his head. 
[00:47:30]  We're all the same.  No, I don't mean...  I'm not...  Ray, that's very funny.  I'm not trying to compare myself to plant.  Trust me.  I'm just saying, as far as humans go...  Very good, Ray.  Look at him.  He's got balls.  I like that, Ray.  I'm not...  Oh, my God.  Do not confuse that issue.  I'm talking...  You look at him and you realize, ah, because some people look at him as God, basically,  because of what he's done in his life.  But you look at him like, look, the guy, even though he did all this great music with Zeppelin,  he can't take care of his own body. 
[00:48:00]  That's all I was trying to say.  He's still got the baloney tits.  Gotcha.  Okay.  I got to thank, first, I don't remember his last name, John the photographer, who came  in to take the poor Opie's picture here and got kind of blown off and booed out of the  studio.  Well, you know what?  I'm getting a lot of slack over that.  And, ah...  He's a nice guy, man.  No, I know he's a nice guy, but I have a problem with the guy, because he did Photoshop my face.  And, you know, the first time we took pictures for XM, they just came out absolutely awful.  Because the make...  I mean, they put makeup on us and there were no pictures being taken after the show like 
[00:48:30]  that.  Thank you, Anthony.  None.  Thank you.  I'm sure he's a nice guy.  He's a very nice guy.  And he was very helpful.  And, of course, I got to thank Lee Abrams for tolerating me.  I popped into his office four times.  Minimum, dude.  No, no, no.  Four times.  I don't got to...  Four times in the office.  How many times did you talk to him downstairs?  A couple.  These guys had...  At least I didn't interrupt him talking to Robert Plant.  Yeah, I did.  Oh!  Oh, you forgot that part. 
[00:49:00]  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  Because you weren't going to get the picture.  What happened?  I'm going to walk you down the hall, sweetie.  We'll get to the end of the story.  Believe me.  Trust me.  Because he was right at this beer in the green room.  No, but he was going to come back out of the green room.  No.  No.  First of all.  No, because I'm not like you were.  I'm going to sit around for two hours.  I knew that was my opportunity.  And I'm like, well...  Right.  And you panicked.  You were...  I didn't panic.  Are you...  He was so hurt.  Oh.  How could you say that?  I walked you down the hall.  I'm like, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I walked you down to get the picture with him.  Because you were standing going, ha.  I don't know.  I'm like, come on.  Let's go.  Come on.  I walked you down to get that picture. 
[00:49:30]  I made sure you got that picture.  I walked you down.  And I'm like, just...  And then...  I...  Let's get into the story.  We've got to get in the water.  We've got to get in the water here.  Okay.  Because I know he's throwing me under the bus.  I want to hear the whole thing.  I'll go under the bus.  Oh, my God.  Get XM on the phone.  I'll go under the bus.  I'll go under the bus.  Everyone down there has a Jim Norton psycho story.  I'll go under the bus.  I'll bring a handful of blonde locks with me.  You're not going to get me completely under the bus on this one.  I'm going to do my thank yous.  I'm going to thank everyone.  Well, Lee Abrams was very, very cool and helpful. 
[00:50:00]  And I also got to thank, of course, Alan Goldberg, who is very, very...  You know, he actually made it happen along with Jamie.  And Eric Logan, who I had to interrupt on the road working a big deal.  Right.  I just wanted to...  Because he called me, so I called him back.  I'm like, you know, I'll get the picture.  I forgot to tell you that.  Yeah.  It got so bad because he didn't know what the hell was going on with the plant picture.  He's calling Elo on the road.  Elo's somewhere making another huge deal for XM.  Yeah.  And he's interrupting Elo to see what Elo can get done, even though he's not in Washington, 
[00:50:30]  to get this picture.  Elo's brokering deals that are going to be, like, huge for the company, huge for the stockholders.  And he's being interrupted with Jimmy phone calls about a photo.  Well, it was a return call, so while I was returning Eric's call...  All right.  So, again, John the photographer, Eric Logan, Alan Goldberg, Lee Abrams.  I want to thank Robert Plant.  I want to thank John Bonham for dying and making his solo career possible.  I want to thank Canon for making such a fine digital product. 
[00:51:00]  I'd like to thank Mel Karmazin and Terrestrial Radio for putting so many fucking commercials in.  You made Satellite a viable possibility, which got me hired at XM.  And, of course, Jamie Karp, more than anyone who made it happen, she was running the whole thing there.  And I talked to her a couple times, and she's like, look, they had told me no.  But she is the one.  Hold on.  Let me talk to eight minutes too late with the cue.  I'm actually finished with the thank yous. 
[00:51:30]  I know.  This would have been great.  It would have been great if during the thank yous you would have cured the thank you Oscar music.  See, everyone needs a vacation at this point.  We're all slowing down.  That was lipstick for a burn victim.  Now, wait.  Jamie had said that they had said no a couple times.  So what happens is Alan Goldberg, we're hanging outside kind of just talking to Lee.  And there's a little hallway you walk into the studio where he was rehearsing, doing a soundcheck.  So I didn't want to just walk in there. 
[00:52:00]  I'm not an idiot.  I don't just walk into the green room areas.  I was hanging outside.  Others would say differently.  No, they could say what they wanted.  Ope was there when Alan Goldberg came over.  He's like, well, I'm like, are we allowed to stand there and watch?  Is that okay?  And he's like, yeah, come on in.  I'll sit you inside.  You can just watch him do a soundcheck.  I'm like, you sure?  He's like, yeah, no problem.  I'll walk in.  He takes us in.  That's when me and Ope got to sit there.  By the way, you know, all kidding aside, that was really cool.  Phenomenal.  So we're sitting there watching Plant.  And then Plant leaves the room for something.  And he's gone for a few minutes.  And I'm like, he ain't coming back in. 
[00:52:30]  Because I know how this stuff goes.  But, you know, Rookie goes.  He was like, who are those two fucking creeps?  I was afraid he was going to have his booted.  Because I'm trying to move.  Oh, yeah.  We're just.  No, were you dancing?  Dude, I was trying to make believe I'm not looking at him.  Because I didn't want him to go, who are the fucking hysterics?  Who the fuck are these two?  Trying to do a fucking soundcheck in this fucking creep.  Right, exactly.  So I'm just making believe.  I'm looking around.  I'm looking at all the other musicians.  They're just basic, you know, old studio musicians.  And I'm making believe they're just as important.  Like, yeah, whatever, dude.  No offense.  You're playing with Plant. 
[00:53:00]  That's cool for your resume.  But I want to see the big guy.  So when we first walk into the room, I wanted to stay by the door.  Because, again, I know that you've got to make this happen.  Everyone had told me how high-road planned is to get a photo with.  So I wanted to stay by the door in the seats.  But the guy's like, no, no, no, come to the middle.  So we had to walk all the way to the middle of the room, which was fine.  Now you're thinking you're going to lose your chance.  Or make it harder, again.  So he's gone for a few minutes.  I just sensed something's awry.  So I walk out of the studio, right outside the studio door.  As I walk out, Alan comes. 
[00:53:30]  He goes, all right, dude, it's going to happen.  He was just in the room here, in the mixing room, the sound room, soundboard room.  And he goes, he took a few pictures.  He's cool with it.  So him and Jamie are telling me, all right, just hang out here, right here, and wait for it.  Because Robert Planned, by the way, just walked back in the room past me and was getting makeup done in the actual studio, where the performance was going to be done.  So Ope finally comes out.  And we're kind of just standing there.  Jamie, I hand Jamie my camera.  Robert's walking.  And look, when he walks out, I stick my hand out.  I'm like, hi, I'm Jim Norton. 
[00:54:00]  Because, again, you have to get him to stop.  Right.  Jamie, who is just great, goes, oh, Robert, can you take a quick picture with you?  And he's like, okay.  And he just stood there, takes a picture.  She snaps.  He walks away.  That's what Ope and I threw him under the bus.  But, dude, well.  He grabs the camera all excited.  I'm sitting there like.  I gave it to Jamie.  But what about me?  I would have gotten.  What am I going to do?  Grab him by the hair and go, get back here.  Let me say something.  I got to give this one to Jimmy.  Of course.  He walked away.  With all the grief that you gave Jimmy about this.  I didn't give grief.  Why would he then say.  No, no, no, no.  I'm giving him. 
[00:54:30]  No, I understand you would have done it if the situation would come up.  Hold on.  I'm giving him grief on the show, yes.  Yeah.  But when it comes to these situations, I've been nothing but a friend.  Yeah.  I hate.  I hate this process that he goes through.  That's what I mean.  You've goofed on this process so much.  But I understand, Jimmy.  And we are friends.  So I'm like, all right, I'll deal as much as I can.  Because it really is not fun.  It's a two-hour process, Anthony.  I don't think it was Jimmy's job, though, to go, oh, Bob, Bob, one more shot.  It wasn't even a thought in his mind, though.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I understand that Robert was walking away fast and the opportunity was blown. 
[00:55:00]  I get that.  But it wasn't even a thought in his head because it was all about him and his pressure.  That's where he's wrong.  Because he was so, and unjustifiably, you are hurt or disappointed.  But this is Robert.  Like, Ben doesn't really care about people that much.  He doesn't get excited about celebrities.  He hangs with them on a nightly basis.  He doesn't give a shit.  We were hanging out.  The only time I saw Ben get, like, a little flustered is when he was, like, a foot from Lars.  He's like, dude, there's Lars. 
[00:55:30]  He's like, it's like, sometimes when you're that close, you're like, jeez, what the fuck am I doing?  I got to do it.  So that was how Ope got with Plant.  And he was really hurt.  And Plant walked away.  And he's like, oh, fuck.  And you were upset.  And I'm like, that's why I took you.  I walked you down the hallway because you were in a bit of Pete Panic mode.  And I walked you down the hallway.  You didn't walk me down the hallway like you were holding my hand.  I was just like, what am I going to do?  So I saw Robert Plant outside the green room with Lee Abrams.  I took you.  I'm like, come on, let's go.  And then you stopped 10 feet from where Plant was. 
[00:56:00]  Because apparently Robert was going to look at him and go, oh, you need one, too.  Come on down here, fella.  You've got to be assertive.  You have to be.  I said be aggressive, dude.  Walk right up to where he is.  Just fucking walk.  I was nudging you.  I dropped in on the conversation Robert Plant was having with Lee Abrams.  And Lee was explaining XM Satellite Radio to him.  And Robert Plant was still awake during this process?  I know.  But he was blown away by it because Lee's a good salesman.  He was explaining XM.  And Robert Plant, his eyes were wide open like, wow, really? 
[00:56:30]  And then he goes, yeah, because commercial radio just stinks.  He said it.  I heard it.  And Robert Plant goes, that wasn't the case 30 years ago when we were coming to the States.  And I'm listening to Robert Plant talk about how cool radio was when he came here 30 years ago.  And then also I'm like, you know what?  I saw Jimmy.  Now we're working together.  I see Jimmy.  This is where he did help me out.  He knew that you get on all fours behind Robert Plant and he pushes him.  I knew he was too nervous.  Like, I knew he had too much dignity to do what needed to be done.  So he was trying to just hang back. 
[00:57:00]  He doesn't want to make an answer.  I was hanging back.  And then I was just going to, Jimmy was on the other side.  I figured I'll just kind of make believe I'm in on the conversation and take a couple  of those pictures.  I go, yeah, that's when me and Robert were talking about satellite radio, even though  I didn't say a word, you know?  So you could smooth all the time.  I did witness this and you were just standing there at that point because I walked over and  I heard them talking about radio.  I was waiting for my in.  They were talking.  I'm thinking, all right, this is going to be a lonely conversation.  I'll jump in and ask him for a picture real fast.  That never really happened. 
[00:57:30]  And then I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to miss my opportunity.  So he ducks under because this is when we were still on the one side.  It was like Robert and Lee were in front of us.  So I finally get him closer.  I'm like, you've got to get closer.  Be aggressive.  Fuck it.  It's a once in a lifetime.  Who cares?  So he ducks because he doesn't want to walk right between Robert and Lee.  So he ducks under them awkwardly.  It was awful.  Under the way?  Was your face like right by Robert Plant's cock at that point?  No, no, but he did duck down as a courtesy.  He goes, oh, excuse me.  And he ducks through.  You've got two guys talking in the hallway and so I'm splitting right between them and I want 
[00:58:00]  to walk right, you know.  So I duck down as I pass by him.  But as he ducks down.  So they still have eye contact as they continue their conversation.  As he ducks down, there's equipment being brought.  So instead of just popping up on the other side, he pops up on the other side and realizes  he has to move because that thing is being pushed.  So you wind up like eight feet away on the other side.  On the other side.  You're overshot, Bobby Plant.  He overshot Robert Plant.  And Nick Nervous ducks down and overshoots and wraps around.  Phil Frightened.  And so I'm like looking at him like, come on, I've got the camera out. 
[00:58:30]  I've got the camera out.  I'm ready to take this picture.  And I know if you didn't, you actually did ask.  But dude, I was.  What a bumbling mess.  He was a mess.  I was blocking that.  All this scene needs is you to bumble the camera like Freda with the gun when his father  got shot.  Papa!  Papa!  But if you didn't ask him, believe that's why I was right there with the camera.  I completely interrupted him.  I'm like, Robert, do you mind a picture?  You had that moment where you're like, this is Robert Plant.  And I'm like, this is it.  So I jump in and my picture was taken and his head is twice as big as mine.  But the glare, there's a glare coming from the window in the back right between their 
[00:59:00]  faces.  So I'm like, all right, hold on.  I make them wait for a second so I can fix the camera right and take that out for you.  And that's why when you look, you want to talk about who annoyed Robert Plant.  Look at the two photos.  Look at Robert's face.  I've got to say, I wasn't even going to, you know something?  I wasn't even waiting for you to say it.  I will say, his picture, Jimmy's picture with Robert Plant, Robert Plant looks  happy to be there.  Your picture, he looks miserable.  He looks like someone who was interrupted.  I've got to say, it's a much happier, cozy picture.  I dare I say cozy. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  A cozy picture with Bobby Plant.  Let me see.  Jimmy has.  And now hit the button on the left of the middle and look at mine.  We're almost snuggling.  Look.  He's smiling a little.  Look at that picture.  And then look at Opie.  I like mine better.  Oh, stop it.  Robert has lust in his eyes when he's with you.  I don't want a picture of lust in Robert Plant's eyes.  That's a sexy picture.  The other one is somebody who's been stalking him and runs up, interrupts a conversation.  Dude, I can't wait to get these photos on the sites because his head is so freaking big. 
[01:00:00]  It's so huge.  Can Steve get these up on Foundry?  It looks like a forced perspective shot where he's really standing closer to the camera  than you guys are.  Well, it looks like that, Anthony, but his head is that big.  I've got to see the...  Maybe Robert Plant's on steroids.  You think he's doing the roids?  A lot of people think Barry Bonds' head got that big from steroids.  Maybe Robert Plant's got the same thing going on.  Wow.  That is huge. 
[01:00:30]  He is just not happy to be there.  When Plant walked by and got the picture of me and then just walked away, that's how fast  it happened.  I know I'm obsessive and I prepare, but that's what I prepare for is being ready for that  moment because if you miss it, there might not be another chance for as long as I live.  There is one of his little curls coming right down on your forehead.  Is it really?  Like your head is in his hair.  You're nuzzling him.  He was very...  We just stood there.  He was very...  If he was jacking you off, you could just turn your head and go...  That's great. 
[01:01:00]  But it was like you have to be ready for that one moment.  You have to be ready because it's like if you're fumbling with the camera and I'm like,  oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  We've seen it happen a thousand times.  To me, it's happened.  I'm patient with fans.  I don't care.  I've had so many camera phones not working and all this shit.  I'm like, I had to retake it.  Camera phone.  But I see what goes wrong and what's annoying.  I'm ready.  If it was just me, as far as Robert Plant, the artist, is concerned, he would have dealt with  me for two seconds and that would have been it.  Right.  So I don't bother the artist.  I'm not obsessive.  I didn't want to hang by the tour bus. 
[01:01:30]  We left right after that.  Oh, my God.  You're not obsessive?  No, no, no.  But I mean...  Your setup is amazing.  My setup is obsessive and it's accurate.  That had to be done, though, dude.  It had to be done that way.  You planned it out like a heist.  It's just not worth it.  Sure it is.  No, it's not.  If it wasn't worth it, you wouldn't have gotten the picture.  I got the picture because I was there.  I wouldn't go through that whole process with you.  I did because I was there and I'm your friend.  I wouldn't do this on my own is what I'm saying.  Did anybody catch the fact that Opus is saying that he got a picture with Robert Plant because  he's my friend?  That's not accurate.  That is so accurate.  I'll tell you why.  Because I wasn't going to stick around and get a picture with Robert Plant yesterday. 
[01:02:00]  You didn't have to.  I was cool going back on.  I thought you guys were leaving early.  I was going to go back with Ben.  I was going back with Ben.  Ben's like, yeah, I'm staying.  I thought you, Steve, and Aunt were leaving at noon.  We're friends.  I decided to do it.  But if I was there by myself, I wouldn't have gone through all that.  No way.  No way.  I just wouldn't.  Well, I don't mind doing the journey.  I mean, am I glad I got a picture with Robert Plant?  Of course.  It's going to be one of the best pictures I've ever gotten.  You can't say, like, I didn't want to get the picture and this and that.  You got the picture.  My preparation was a bit obsessive. 
[01:02:30]  I'm just saying I had to go through the whole thing with you that I wouldn't do on my own.  No way.  No way.  But you didn't have to.  You didn't have to.  I was totally cool with you.  I'm not saying you dragged me along.  No.  I went willingly because part of me knows it's going to make for good radio.  You know?  Yeah.  And it does amaze me what you go through to get these photos, so I don't know.  And I'm a team player.  I want you to get the picture, too.  He just walked away that first time.  It's fun for Jimmy, I think, for other people to get the picture. 
[01:03:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  As long as he gets it.  He was already looking at the shot Jamie took.  Yes.  Making sure it was taken correctly.  And Robert's walking by, and I'm just like, but what about me?  We got you.  Dude, you weren't looking at the picture a second after it was taken.  Of course.  To make sure it was okay.  It would have been, as I see it, it would have been really difficult for him to go, oh,  wait, one more.  It was an impossibility.  And then to set it up and, oh, boy.  Jump in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'll tell you what the move was.  What was the move?  Jamie had your camera. 
[01:03:30]  You go, you know, Jamie, obviously I want my picture.  And if possible, Ope wants one, too.  I said that to Alan the Goldberg, actually.  But Jamie didn't know that.  Jamie thought it was all about getting your picture, which is fine.  I said one of each, and Robert walked away.  Why didn't you say it to her?  You're the Ope and Anthony show.  You could have said, hey, Jamie.  You were bothering her so much, I didn't even want to say hi to her.  Wow.  I swear to God you were.  That's not true.  But you see all the excuses?  Like, he makes the excuse why he didn't say to her, hey, let me do this.  You should have probably said to her, of course you should have.  She's got the camera, hey, one for me, two, me, two.  Yeah, of course.  I'm not as aggressive when it comes to this stuff. 
[01:04:00]  That isn't really aggressive.  Over the years, I've missed out on so many photographs because I wasn't aggressive enough.  Yeah.  Ones I really wanted.  You know, people that came in the studio, I'm like, ah, I don't want to bother him.  Ah.  Okay.  And now, you know, sure, I wish I had some shots, but.  I'm, you know, it's like, it's annoying.  Like, I met Kinnison, and I got an autograph.  I kind of, I didn't do pictures back then.  I kind of wish I had.  But then it dies after.  I'm like, you know what?  I've always been grateful that I asked for that stupid napkin to be signed that I have as a silly permit.  You know what? 
[01:04:30]  There you go.  There's only one celebrity photo I have hanging up, and that's with Kinnison.  Me and Kinnison.  I wish I would have got that one.  That's the only one.  And we, and I have pictures with all of Aerosmith, Metallica.  I mean, you name it, we have it.  That's the only one that I display.  The only one.  But this, this is my thing.  Like, I like doing this.  I don't mind that process because it's, first of all, I realize, it's one of the fun parts about being in dumb show business is that I'm getting access to a place that I never would have had access to before.  I was allowed to go by his dresser.  You can't get that. 
[01:05:00]  Nope.  And at XM, it was a comfortable environment because they're all cool there, so it was like, ah, they helped me out.  MJB from Philly.  A picture with Robert Plant.  This sounds like, this recounting sounds like a World War II story.  We were surrounded by XM employees and the battery was low.  It doesn't really sound like a mission you guys were on yesterday.  And anyone that's ever taken a photo with me, I've never not taken a photo with someone, so I know what it's like to have your picture taken with people.  Let's say hi to John in Chicago.  John? 
[01:05:30]  I hope that I'm with you.  It's like, it's two sides of the coin.  One's like, I could really use a picture, but the other hand is like, ah, fuck Robert Plant.  They're going to make me go through all that shit for a goddamn picture.  Well, you don't want to go through all the hassle up there in Chicago.  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad, but, you know, I wouldn't have waited around two hours.  Okay, but you didn't.  If I was by myself, let's say you had a gig, you couldn't make it down to XM News, I swear to you, there's no way I would have went through that.  I do believe you.  But, I mean, I'm cool with doing that by myself.  I don't mind.  For me, it's just, I know what I've got to do. 
[01:06:00]  And the only reason I did ask like five times is because Lee, who knows everybody, said, look, this is a tough one.  He goes, anybody else, I could guarantee.  He goes, this one, I don't know.  He goes, it looks good, but his people are very protective, man.  Here's what I see as an outside observer.  I had no part of this, but see, hearing the testimony of both parties, I see Jimmy is crazed when it comes to setting up the shot.  But the bottom line is when time comes for that shot, everything is so perfect that it goes off without a hitch. 
[01:06:30]  So the end justifies the means, I guess.  Opie, you, I think, got caught up in the whole Jimmy setting it up where it got you flustered just because he takes, puts so much work into the setup that you felt a little odd saying, hey, one with me too.  But from what I'm seeing, you probably should have just waved to her and gone, one of those.  And it would have been like that.  It would have been done.  It's like airline security in the sense that airline security is not built for 99% of the things. 
[01:07:00]  So most precautions we take when getting onto a plane are not necessary.  There you go.  But it's for the guy that has a bomb.  That's why it's necessary.  You're set up, ready to go.  Most stuff I do, I probably could have showed up there five minutes before and saw Jamie.  Right.  But I didn't know that.  So you have to take precautions because you don't know what you're going to have.  So the good five, six, seven hour setup is really what you need.  No.  Oh, it wasn't?  No.  Four hours for the show and it was pretty much the entire show.  Oh, okay.  Well, you look at it like that.  And then another three hours after the show. 
[01:07:30]  Well, it was two hours after, but.  Okay, six hours of setup.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot to, yeah.  We forgot to talk about that.  When we were going, doing breaks yesterday during the show, he was running out of the studio already pre-planning.  I forgot about that.  So, yeah, it was way more than two hours.  If you can't do it, like, a lot of times you'll say, wow, they'll do a meet and greet after, but the photographer told me not.  The show yesterday was secondary to Jim.  That's not true.  Oh, yeah, it was.  It was not so true.  I was just on every break.  That's not true.  Yeah, but as soon as we went to commercial, you're off and running and pre-planning. 
[01:08:00]  That's like saying that urinating, the show is secondary to urinating.  When we go to commercials, Anthony and I are like, all right, what do you want to do next?  Well, you know, you go to the piss and Anthony just sits there.  What are you talking about?  You guys don't know.  Not all the time.  I mean, the internet.  Yeah.  We do that when we know we have something to go to next.  Okay.  So, we're going to take a break and.  Well, let's see how much show talk you guys do.  All right.  Did you mention the HBO thing?  I don't even know.  Oh, no.  No, this is a thank you for reminding me. 
[01:08:30]  I finally found out from HBO ticket information.  I'm filming this special.  I have two shows.  Tuesday, April 26th.  Tickets, they're doing this.  We fought really hard to get Opie and Anthony fans first crack at these tickets because they  want to distribute them a certain way.  Like, HBO has ways they distribute.  And, yeah, this was.  To old people coming in.  Dude, exactly.  That's the way Comedy Central does it.  I mean, HBO is actually good with ticket distribution, but this was a nightmare to get done.  So, if you want tickets, my HBO special being shot April 26th. 
[01:09:00]  This is like a pre-show, but the tickets are free.  So, we're anticipating these are going to go relatively quickly.  They will go really quickly.  It's less than 1,000 tickets combined for two shows.  It's not a huge theater.  You can save some for your pal, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Opie and Anthony, I'm hoping we'll come to both shows.  And Steve from Foundry, of course, will be there.  Yes.  The fire extinguisher next to him.  So, the email address, put your age, I'm sorry, just your name and email, jimnortonatbroadwayvideo.com.  That's not my email address.  HBO set up a special account so O&A fans can get this because the tickets are not available yet. 
[01:09:30]  This is a pre-sale for Opie and Anthony fans only.  Jimnortonatbroadwayvideo.com for my HBO special, April 26th.  And thanks for reminding me.  I forgot about that.  And what do I have to send there to that email address?  Just an email.  Put your name and email address, and they're going to send you an official invite.  Then you tell them how many you want.  Because these are free tickets, man.  This is why these are done really odd, because you're not putting any credit card information, nothing.  Right.  Make sure you can make it, though.  You get to see Jim Norton for free as he films his HBO special. 
[01:10:00]  That's just huge.  And on the first show, actually, it's me and Kevin Brennan, each doing a half hour.  And Kevin is one of the funniest comics in New York.  A lot of guys know him from the Comedy Cellar.  And on the later show, it won't be anyone but me.  Just Jim.  Let's just say that that was another point of contention and a lot of fighting and stuff,  because, you know, the ONA fans are a bit specific.  Yes, they are, in their case.  A lot of people are a little nervous about the ONA fans.  I just love pests.  We were at the Hard Rock, and I'm just watching these animals. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And I'm like, these guys love us.  Yep.  Like, this is every performer's worst nightmare, and there's nobody else I want in the room  but them.  Audience full of fruit monkeys.  Dude, just, oh, yeah, that's that.  Fruit monkeys tossing feces in the stage.  They're just aggressive psychopaths.  Yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break, but this just in.  The Robert Plant photos are online.  Wow, that quick?  Yeah.  Where can we find them?  Thanks to Martini Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  Foundrymusic.com.  I said, where can we find them?  And opiananthony.com. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, okay.  Go to opiananthony.com.  And look at Bob's expression in both photos.  Right.  You guys make the determination.  I don't care.  I will argue that I like my picture better.  Just look at the Robert Plant part.  Okay.  Because, I don't know, there's lust in his eyes when he's smiling with you.  Lust in his eyes.  Well, look at it, Anthony.  Oh, Eric, can I get a CD of all the Aussie pictures that were here?  Thank you.  All right, done.  Love you.  Hey, I want, I need my Bernie Getz picture.  Who has that one?  Oh, look at the little curl in your face. 
[01:11:30]  Look at my fat neck.  I am a piece of shit.  That's a nice picture.  He's smiling.  He looks all cozy.  Yeah, let's see Ope's picture.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, God, is he miserable.  That was after he got the news of a relative having prostate cancer face.  That's the I'm sorry, John Bonham's dead face right there.  Yeah, there's Dr. Hughes behind him giving them the bad news.  And Robert's walking away in a house.  Dr. Hughes making the bad news. 
[01:12:00]  Look at Ope's smiling and happy.  And the legend wants to go into his green room and just pick at his foreskin.  You know what really pisses me off?  What?  Your picture has been viewed 15 times already.  Mine, nine.  Oh.  Oh, now it's a contest.  Now it's a contest.  Yeah, it is.  I will say in fairness that they probably blew mine up to see that little lock of hair  that Anthony's talking about.  That's wonderful.  It's all about how you sell yourself and people would want to see.  Wow, now it's up to 101 times I've checked out your picture with Plant and I'm up to 81 times. 
[01:12:30]  Because people know it doesn't mean much to you.  You just happen to be there.  I happen to love it.  Yeah, no one's listening to this show.  People are checking out these pictures like crazy.  Now it's up to 123 views for you, 111 for me.  Let me tell you what...  Well, you made a hell of a comeback in that last one, though.  That really bothered me.  Let me tell you what Lunatic Opey is going to obsess on now for the entire program.  The picture count?  Refreshing the picture count.  So, guys, if you look at my picture and not Ope's, it's really going to annoy and upset him. 
[01:13:00]  So don't look at my picture without looking at his or it will really bother him.  It's up to 153 to 141.  Oh, you're catching up.  I got 157, 163.  Really?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, and Inside Radio claims that Ant and I have disappeared.  Of course we have.  How long ago did you make this announcement that the picture's up?  About a minute now?  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  Now you can barely get on the site.  Everyone's going there.  Yeah, now I can't even refresh it.  Oh, it's closed.  Come on, guys.  We'll take a break and we'll see what it's up to next. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, what is it, Ant?  I think Opey passed him.  Did he really?  I'm getting 180 Opey, 178 Jimmy.  Yeah, because my picture's more interesting.  It's not more interesting.  More interesting.  They can't see you in it because you're eight feet behind Robert Plant.  They have to enlarge it.  Oh, yeah, baby.  It's just to see where you are.  Oh, yeah.  221 for me, 207 for little Jimmy Norton.  Mine is just beautiful.  No, because your picture's too perfect.  They want to see what's wrong with my picture.  You are snuggling with Robert Plant.  Shut up, Anthony. 
[01:14:00]  I'm just going to want them to check that one out.  How can you see the little lock of hair on me if you can't blow up my picture?  You've got to see Robert's little lock on my forehead.  It's adorable.  You can't see it at that size, though.  You're trying to sell it.  No.  No, no, no, no.  Free beer for anyone that checks out my picture.  Free beer in Boston.  Oh, let me get yours.  I'm refreshing, but the site is just getting slammed now.  It's getting pounded now.  Absolutely slammed. 
[01:14:30]  270 to 278.  Damn it!  Jimmy's ahead again now?  Wow, it's a horse race.  Why don't we take a break?  Dirk, get us out of here.  We're going to get into other radio next, man.  We're going to get into other radio next, man. 
[01:15:00]  We're going to get into other radio next, man. 
[01:15:30]  We're going to get into other radio next, man.  We're going to get into other radio next, man.  Thank you. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, hey, terrific.  Oh, hey, oh, hey. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey.  That's a shit.  You can't just be.  I'm not here. 
[01:18:00]  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  I'm not here.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202.  Opie and Anthony.  XM202. 
[01:18:30]  What is going on today?  By the way, we're doing a live show tomorrow.  Some confusion, Anthony.  Oh, some moronic listeners are bitching because they're saying we're off tomorrow.  We're not off tomorrow.  We come in.  We do a regular show tomorrow.  And then we start our little vacation after the show.  So we are indeed on the air tomorrow. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, it's going to be a shitty show, but...  Oh, it's going to stink on ice.  Please.  We've always...  Talking about calling it in.  Yeah, we've always been known for just having an awful show before vacation because we're  so distracted.  Why should it be any different than school?  Remember that?  The last school day before vacation?  What did you get accomplished?  Nothing.  Mm-hmm.  Same way here.  That's why we're trying to give you a really good one today.  Trying, anyway.  Trying.  I think tomorrow's going to be a bit of a pre-vacation dud. 
[01:19:30]  Well, Bob Kelly's sitting in for you.  Well, that's not good.  Jimmy's not good.  Oh.  Bob is great.  Yeah, Bob is great.  No, Bob's been giving us great radio.  I love the fact that we're kind of reinventing ourselves in front of everyone.  You know, a lot of people are like, why aren't you bringing back this person and that person?  Because Anthony and I know best.  We know we went to the well too many times with a lot of people, and it's just time to  come up with new characters.  New blood.  New blood.  I mean, come on. 
[01:20:00]  Dee Dee's a star already.  Absolutely.  The new Andre is a star.  Pat from Menaki.  Oh, please.  Celebrity.  There's not one comic that does this show, whether it was Keith or Bobby or Billy, that  isn't amazed how much fun it is to have this freedom and just to do what you want and be  laid back.  And it's just, it's amazing how much fun.  You can't do commercial radio after this.  It just sucks.  We reen it.  Dude, it's awful after doing this.  You know, I got to break in for a second.  They sent Wiki up here.  Yep. 
[01:20:30]  Wiki is an expert that's been sent up from Washington.  Yeah.  Because they just don't, you know, well, you guys have heard his bitch, obviously, about  the equipment over and over and over again.  And they try to fix stuff.  We have conversations over the phone.  And then we have meetings down there.  And they finally decided to send an expert up.  This guy, Wiki, who's a very cool guy, by the way, right?  Yeah.  As you guys are talking, he's just staring at these meters over here and just shaking  his head going, what is that? 
[01:21:00]  It's like nothing I've ever seen and nothing that's supposed to be there.  It's just a mess, right?  That's bad, right?  It doesn't look good.  It doesn't look good.  Yep.  Because there was a point where the people in Washington said, well, maybe Opie and Anthony  just don't know how to use the equipment right.  Yeah.  He's the reconnaissance team for the people that are going to be coming up and fixing the  studio while we're on vacation.  Yeah.  So he's here to look and see how the show works and see what equipment needs fixing. 
[01:21:30]  And then he's going to translate it to the people because we're morons as far as a lot  of this stuff goes, we can't really tell them what the problem is, you know?  So he's the guy that's going to look around and make sure he relays it to them in the proper  terminology.  And then they come in here and fix it.  And then we come in after the vacation, Opie, it's going to be like paradise in here.  Oh, I'll be able to hear myself loud and clear.  No more phone problems.  I think there's going to be some fine tuning, which we're willing to accept. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Because we want to bitch less.  Because now we know we're going to take it to the next level.  I mean, we are attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  And we're psyched at the fact that we're going to be off the premium.  Yeah.  So many more listeners.  A ton of listeners are going to be piling into this program.  A bunch of them are going to hate it and never listen.  Did you hear my suggestion in the meeting?  What?  I said, is there a way we can have a phone pad put in front of Opie so we can dial out  instead of having to say, Eric, run in there, call this number. 
[01:22:30]  Because in the old days, we used to just beep, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  We used to just dial.  And they were like, phone line out.  Sure.  I'm like, God damn, that's great.  And who's the guy who's like the really big, the real genius of all this stuff?  Ed?  Is that who it is?  Yes.  Ed Schwartz.  He's, I think, currently on trial for murder.  That's psychopath.  He does look like shit.  Is he nuts?  He looks nuts, but he knows what he's doing.  Oh, he's a genius.  He talks, and I have no clue what he's talking about.  He just rattles this satellite stuff off like he's talking about simple arithmetic. 
[01:23:00]  And it's just the most involved thing.  He's talking about what units need to be installed here.  And everything will be fixed.  Those big glasses.  And he's a brilliant guy.  Oh, yeah.  And then you say, how do I talk to a girl?  And then he goes, how do I talk to a girl?  He's got a mind like Stephen Hawking.  I think he knows how to dig what's called a shallow grave.  Oh, without a doubt.  They're going to find dead prostitutes somewhere with just like, with little XM stickers over 
[01:23:30]  their mouths.  Oh.  Somewhere in the Sierra Mountains.  Well, they say when you're a genius like that, another part of your brain definitely suffers.  Yes.  Little pink blood-stained Kango hat in his trunk.  Oh, Jesus.  Little, little, uh, pimento bugs and other things only native to Florida all over the windshield.  So there's going to be a lot of excitement when we get back from vacation as we take this  to the next level, Anthony.  And don't forget. 
[01:24:00]  Is he coming here to help supervise the fix?  Really?  The whole A-team is coming in.  So he's coming from Washington to New York?  Does he have to re-register even if he's just staying here for a short period of time?  It's going to be a whole pit crew coming up.  Nice.  Yeah.  Psyched.  So.  And don't forget, the first day back from vacation, we're going to be in Boston.  Mm-hmm.  That's, uh.  For two days.  First two days, yes.  All the info is up on opianthony.com.  But basically, uh, April 11th, we're doing our show from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. East Coast time  because it's opening day for the Sox. 
[01:24:30]  They're playing the Yanks.  We're going to be at Bill's Bar on Lansdowne Street.  That's right behind the Green Monster.  It's going to be just a zoo.  Oh, yeah.  21 and up.  And a lot of you guys bitch, hey, man, we're under 21.  We'd love to hang out with you guys, blah, blah, blah.  So Tuesday, we're going to do a whole thing at, uh, Paradise, The Paradise, whatever.  Mm-hmm.  And we're going to do our regular show, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. East Coast time.  And that's just for 11 through 14.  Yes.  All ages.  I know.  It's getting a little confusing.  So just go to foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com and help us spread the virus on that thing. 
[01:25:00]  Spread the word because we're not going to be able to promote that too well.  Okay?  Slim from Buffalo.  Just look at the Jimmy Plant picture.  All Jimmy's missing is a corsage and a prom dress.  Could he get any more of a nuzzle under Robert Plant?  Well, Robert was nuzzling me too.  I mean, we were nuzzling each other.  You were both nuzzling.  I didn't nuzzle him.  Look at his smile.  He's a very, very willing recipient of that canoodle.  Bedroom eyes he had on too.  Dreamy.  Bedroom dreamy eyes.  Who's this little dreamy man?  Yeah.  You look like you're giving Robert Plant a hand job. 
[01:25:30]  I would have had a respect.  You have to.  I'm a Sabbath fan over Zeppelin, but I have a tremendous respect for Plant.  You know what I like about my Robert Plant picture?  You can read his mind and it says, just take the fucking picture.  Absolutely.  And your eager smile.  Hi, guys.  Look, I'm here with my pal Bobby Plant.  I got a great Aussie photo too.  He's got his arm around me.  He's hanging his arm around me.  He's smiling.  I know.  Buddies.  Buddies.  We had a good week.  Dude, we had a great week. 
[01:26:00]  Good week.  And that Monday push was the best thing.  If we had gone down to D.C. Monday, Tuesday, we would have missed Aussie and Robert Plant.  Yeah, true.  Look at that.  Everything worked out for the best.  How rare is that in my life?  Never.  Never.  You didn't ruin the Robert Plant moment with a bad prostitute.  I'm just looking at what.  Wow.  Right?  We got a girl in the studio.  Oh, B.  You ruin it every time before they come in.  She's sitting in front of the window.  Wow.  Very nice.  Wearing wet pink pants.  What a lovely girl.  Got pink pants, a little shirt on. 
[01:26:30]  I'll say.  A tiny shirt.  Wow.  Well, and very nice.  Oh, goodness.  Very nice implants.  Yes.  She's going to come in in a little while.  My word.  It's so funny.  Speaking of which, we've got to get Steve in here and maybe Ben in here.  So we take the Accela back up from Washington, right?  Yeah.  And we got on the train at 2 o'clock.  We had the whole train to ourselves.  We're pretty much all sitting separately, all nice, you know?  And as you get closer and closer to New York, you get all the businessmen coming on the train. 
[01:27:00]  And they all have to get their cell phones working because it's so important that they get business done as the train goes to New York.  Quiet.  And I realized that we're just a bunch of scumbags because we're sitting in a four-seater, basically, two people facing Steve and I.  Because now the train is completely packed.  When it hits Philly, forget it.  All hell breaks loose.  All these guys come on and women, business people, and they're all on their cell phones, their Blackberries, their laptops, just doing business left and right.  Sell, sell, sell. 
[01:27:30]  It's just nuts.  And Norton is the only one that has an empty seat for a while.  Really?  And he even lost a battle because he looks like a complete psychopath on purpose.  Yeah.  So no one will see.  He's got traveling just figured out down to the table.  Well, me and Ben were sitting, and I won't do this again.  We got on the train in Washington where it starts, so it's empty.  And I have to face forward to get motion sick.  So we have those two chairs and then a little table in between and then two seats facing you.  Right.  I could never face backwards or I'd vomit.  But the problem with the seats with the table is they don't go back as far because the wall is behind you. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  But you can put your feet up on a seat.  But when it fills up, you don't want to sit across from someone because I don't want my knees touching someone else's knees.  Those are the worst seats for people that you don't know.  Like if you have four people traveling together and they're all sitting there, you have your little conversation.  But to have to sit for hours staring someone you don't know in the face like that, it's awful.  Those seats are like the old World War II movies where the guy escapes from the Nazi POW camp, sits down, and he's right across from the Gestapo guy. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And he's got to sit there and talk German to him and stuff.  That's how uncomfortable it is when someone sits across from you.  You have no clue who they are.  Well, Jimmy...  Touching knees.  Yeah, it's awful.  Jimmy puts his hood on really tight and just has this psycho look.  Yeah, psycho look.  And no one will sit next to him.  And I'm listening to my music.  I got my fantastic Bose headphones on my laptop.  Yeah.  That was great.  And we talked about it.  The last time we came back from Washington, I was sitting in the same area as...  Oh, you were sitting right behind me.  That's right.  And what Norton did last time was make believe he's sick. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, he was hacking this cough up.  And not only just making the sick noises, all of a sudden he leans over to me and goes,  Man, I just can't wait for this flu to be over or whatever.  I'm really sick.  I'm really sick.  Oh, it sucks.  Because this businesswoman sat next to me and she's talking to a fucking boss in front  of me about business in the office.  And I'm like, this bitch is going to get up at the next stop.  And I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, man, this flu is killing me.  And I know that this twat is getting upset.  That's right.  Beat it, stupid.  Find another seat. 
[01:29:30]  So the observation I want to make, everyone's doing their business calls, okay?  You know, give me a few examples.  Some guy's trying to sell stock or whatever.  And some guy is like, you know, is that stupid office talk?  Well, yeah, but there's a lot of attorneys, I know.  Attorneys meet me at the office and we'll discuss that file that I've set up.  And we're sitting across from a lady that I guess her job is to taste cake.  She has some kind of business where she tastes cake.  Is that what you got? 
[01:30:00]  I heard her talking about getting rights to use a recipe.  Yeah, getting rights to, we can use the recipe, but we don't own the recipe.  Tasting cake?  Maybe she's a porn girl and you misheard her.  No, this is not.  And then she's talking about cost points or whatever that term is in the corporate world.  Point costs or something.  We've got to keep that down.  She's like, of course we do.  I tasted some cake today and it was really good, but it's going to be too expensive because 
[01:30:30]  it's going to raise our, I don't know, cost per point or something like that.  Food service something.  Yeah, yeah.  And so you get all these business conversations that you kind of listen in on a little bit  and they're all interesting.  You've got the attorneys, you've got the guy selling stock, you've got this guy that's  really important that's setting up a meeting in Chicago, has to make sure this is right,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then Steve decides he has to make his business calls.  Yeah.  And he's not shy.  Like, I hate, hate talking, you know, anyone knowing I'm there basically, okay? 
[01:31:00]  So Steve's sitting next to me and all these conversations going on and Steve starts his  calls.  So yeah, Yoshi, yes, we got your latest porn.  The guys, thank you.  And then he calls some guy, John or whatever, John from the Sex Expo.  Yes, John, we will, the guys will have the porn chicks in tomorrow.  It's like that scene out of Clerks.  Yeah, where the guy's ordering the videos with the woman and her baby and the videos  talking.  Exactly.  I need chocolate ass fuckers volume three and nine. 
[01:31:30]  Exactly.  Actually, I try to be discreet about it, but number one, the subject matter makes it very  difficult to be discreet.  Also, my voice carries.  Of course it does.  No matter how softly I speak.  It's cozy.  But it's funny because it's a business conversation like everyone else is doing, but the business  we're in is a little different, as we all know.  So he's like setting up the meeting with the porn stars.  I need cum-gurgling teenage suck-sluts.  You got that, Yoshi?  And the lady that's the cake tester sitting across from us is looking up like, what the  fuck do these guys do for a living? 
[01:32:00]  It's business.  Yeah, but you missed it.  The guy that was sitting with us, one of the guys just got up and left after he heard  me and Jim talk for a few minutes.  He just had had it.  Oh, really?  Except for, yeah, it was me and him, and then the guy who looked like Mark Price, which  was Skippy from Family Ties, sits next to me.  And as seats started to open, when you go from Philadelphia to Metro Park, you're going  to have a few seats open.  Yeah.  Because Metro Park's a big stop.  And it's like, so your thing you should do is just get up and get out of my fucking  way.  Just go.  Go sit someplace else.  But he just sits there for the remainder of the ride. 
[01:32:30]  Why not get up and move?  It really was annoying me.  No one wants anyone else next to you.  Don't try to look polite.  He was trying to be polite and not get up.  Be rude.  Go.  And then the other guy sat down right in our area.  He took over and bite his face.  Dude, I always take my shoes off when I travel, and as soon as I had to move over and Ben and  I were across, I took both of my feet, and I just rested them on his.  I rested both of my feet on Ben's.  And his foot was...  Get off!  I've got one guy, he was like doing business, and I'm like, we're talking about Ozzy, and 
[01:33:00]  you know.  But the business call Steve was making so loud on the train.  I'm like, oh my God.  He talks loud, too.  This guy hugs your hearings, my son.  I just need...  And he speaks so clearly, because fucking no one can misinterpret what he said.  This guy, yeah, he has the biggest balls.  He doesn't care.  I just need to...  I was trying to set up the girls for today, and I wanted to make sure they weren't going  to be these petrified girls.  I feel like he's a legitimate businessman.  Oh, I know.  All right, so the whores will arrive at 8 o'clock, and well, it's up to them what they want to 
[01:33:30]  do in front of Opie and Anthony, but they're hoping that they get naked and possibly finger  each other.  Yeah.  And I'm just like, Steve, you shut the fuck up.  They're willing to show their pussies.  Right.  Would they agree to a thumb in their assholes?  Yeah, he's negotiating like every other business guy on the train.  It's just the nature of the negotiation is a little bit different.  That's all.  Mergers and acquisitions.  All right, they can do the double dill-double.  One of them has to take it in the ass, and we're not going to bend on that.  Next stop, North.  Next stop, North.  We need them to eat box.  They must both eat box. 
[01:34:00]  So one of them rub Jimmy's cock through his pants if he doesn't take it out.  So I'm just mortified.  I'm looking down, and I'm looking at Steve, and I'm trying to get his attention, like,  will you shut the fuck up?  And then I look up across the way, and there I see Cake Lady just looking horrified, and she  can't get out of her seat because the train is packed, and she just wants another seat  so badly.  That was also part of the idea.  I really don't like being in those confined spaces.  Oh, it was just classic.  It was classic.  And then a guy sat behind me, and he has a MiFi. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah?  And, of course, Ben, who knows everything, you know, Ben comes over.  He goes, that guy has a MiFi.  He's listening to the show.  So now the rest of the ride from Metro Park to...  Yeah, he got off at us in New York.  But I'm kind of taking a peek, seeing if he's enjoying the show.  And, of course, there once a while, he starts laughing.  Oh, there you go.  Okay, good, good.  A happy listener.  I could see his face the whole time from the angle I was sitting at, and I didn't know him  until Ben pointed it out.  And he had a smile on his face the whole time.  He said, like, that kind of, like, half-enjoying thing. 
[01:35:00]  That's what it is to watch someone enjoying the show.  Well, that's when this whole satellite radio got cool for me in my neighborhood.  I was just walking Columbus Avenue one day, and, you know, I'm sitting on a bench just  drinking Starbucks coffee, you know, it was a nice early winter day, I guess, right?  And all of a sudden, there's a car in front of me cranking out our show on the replay.  And now I'm just staring at him.  He has no idea I'm staring at him, and I'm wondering when he's going to, you know, switch  around to another channel, you know, because that's what happens with listening habits.  If we're boring one day, of course these guys are going to go somewhere else. 
[01:35:30]  And he didn't.  And he's just laughing along, and I'm like, oh, my God.  There you go.  People are actually listening to this.  And they laugh.  You don't see the reaction of an audience.  It's very weird.  It's one of the things I like and hate about it.  You like it because you don't have to see their faces when you're eating your nuts.  But it's like sometimes it would be nice to see the laughs and the good time they're  having.  It's a little weird, though, because, you know, you don't want your feelings hurt.  You're like, oh, God.  Oh, well, look.  The guy's enjoying the show.  It's strange.  Yeah.  All right.  We're just babbling today.  We got...  Oh, it's fun.  We'll just chat.  Before you leave.  Sure. 
[01:36:00]  The Terry Schabo thing you brought in.  There was audio up on Drudge the other day, and it was actually a dead link, but somebody  was nice enough to send it in.  It's audio of Terry Schabo's...  Dead link.  Is that what they're calling her now?  Oh, you meant on the website.  Dead link.  It's audio of Terry Schabo's father speaking to her in bed, and you hear a little voice off  in the distance, but the one that's really distinct is Terry's, and it's just a lot of...  But is she answering?  Yeah, is she?  And is this legit?  Is this legit audio?  Yeah.  I think it is, too.  I've heard this existed, and the link was dead. 
[01:36:30]  And how many years ago is this?  That I'm not sure about.  I've been trying to find out.  And can we take this...  Ten years before her accident.  And can we take this audio and mix it in with the Patrick O'Brien sex tapes?  Ooh.  Write that down.  Yeah.  We have one day to take advantage of the...  Completely exploit the Patrick O'Brien...  Yeah, the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  One day left, guys.  You've got to send in your mixes.  So this is audio of the father talking to her in her hospital bed. 
[01:37:00]  And does she answer?  It certainly sounds like she's answering.  I mean, they don't really sound random.  That's creepy.  She's there starving to death right now.  Yeah, I don't like this whole thing, man.  This is ugly.  It is a little weird.  I don't like her fucking...  I think her ex-husband is just thinking of other motives.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's not just, oh, she wanted it that way.  This seems like, ah, she's kind of still kicking, and a lot of his money is going to take care of her.  Potentially his money.  It's probably her money, but since they're, I don't know, married.  Imagine, imagine if you will, that Terry... 
[01:37:30]  Imagine if you will.  Terry Schiavo.  Terry Schiavo.  Schiavo, excuse me.  Terry Schiavo is actually completely there.  Wow.  But cannot communicate.  And they're all looking at her, and she can see what's going on in the hospital room.  That is a Twilight Zone episode.  It's like, dude, do not take that meeting tube out.  Oh, my God.  I am coming back.  I'm alive.  I'm in here.  Will someone hear me?  I'm in here.  I'm in here.  Oh, that's horrible.  You're in the rainbow.  So Haitian just blew something into her face 15 years ago.  Dr. Allen. 
[01:38:00]  You know, I've heard stories about people who are in comas, and they say that they heard their family members in the room.  There's a girl.  There was one girl who was in a coma for 11 years.  She was a big Bryan Adams fan.  Her mother took her to a Bryan Adams concert.  She came out of the coma at the concert.  At the cost of everyone else falling into one.  Bryan Adams, shut up.  Everyone else is out.  But, you know, it's like they say that there are times when you can hear, but then again, maybe they determine she has no brain activity. 
[01:38:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, you know, they have ways of doing this.  I guess they hook you up to all kinds of stuff and see what kind of electric action is going on in your head.  And apparently not much.  Apparently not too much going on in there.  I'm not dead.  What?  I'm not dead.  Yeah.  I'm not.  I don't want to go.  Oh, W should have baby.  I feel fine.  I think I'm going for a walk.  You're not fooling anyone, you know.  I feel happy.  I feel happy.  Oh, wow.  She sounds kind of okay in that. 
[01:39:00]  No, I think I agree with the husband.  He's right.  Sorry, Anthony.  That was the wrong audio.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm not dead.  Am I Python?  Yeah.  That's fucking funny.  All right.  You guys want to hear the Terry Schiavo audio?  Absolutely.  All right.  Here it is.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Asshole.  Asshole.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  That obviously is not the Terry Schiavo audio.  The Terry Schiavo audio was pulled off the Internet. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Because the Internet is for important audio.  Yeah, there are other things that I don't have highlighted here.  No, it's for great audio.  I mean, that was where they got it.  I remember the Drudge Report had said, and it was like a rumor, was it a real?  Yeah.  Or was it a hoax?  They just...  Yeah, you just keep stalling until Anthony points that.  Oh, no, we're just chit-chatting.  Let's see how good you really are, Jimmy.  I'm very good.  Go ahead.  I don't like this whole case.  I don't like it because I don't know if she's really...  The family is fighting too hard to keep her alive.  You can't just let someone die of thirst. 
[01:40:00]  The Internet is for porn.  Yes.  The Internet is for porn.  Hawk, mark that for Ant.  All right, guys, enough.  Come on.  Let's get into the Terry Schiavo audio.  Here's Terry Schiavo being interviewed or talked to by her father.  The Internet is for porn.  The Internet is for porn.  All right, Anthony, please. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I got the audio, okay?  Here's Terry Schiavo's father talking to her daughter.  You know, I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  Here's Terry Schiavo, I'm sorry.  Here's Terry Schiavo, I'm sorry.  Here's Terry Schiavo, I'm sorry.  Here's Terry Schiavo.  All righty.  Yeah.  I'm Al Franken, and I'm covering this convention. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Are you having a good time?  I am.  Who have you talked to so far?  I'm sorry.  Boo-y-y-on.  Boo-y-y-on.  You know, I couldn't agree more.  Yeah.  It was really nice talking to you.  I'm glad you're here.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  Yeah.  I think it's fabulous.  Can I shake your hand? 
[01:41:30]  Thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  Good seeing you, man.  Yeah.  Okay, have a good time.  Sticky retard fingers.  Oh, you know they're all sticky.  Dirty.  Slimy.  Touching things on the ground, picking up pennies and eating them.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  Stop laughing at me.  And that's funny, Taylor.  Stop laughing at me. 
[01:42:00]  I'm scared of you.  Oh, God.  That is awful.  All right, well, the father, Terry Schiavo's father, talking to Terry Schiavo.  Yeah, wait a minute.  Let me, I'll cure it up.  There you go.  All right.  Thanks.  He was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[01:42:30]  We can freeze his head.  Anthony, I have the audio of Terry Schiavo's father talking to his daughter.  You're a filthy whore!  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Let's do it!  I don't think that's them. 
[01:43:00]  No?  No, I think our tapes are being confused or something.  Okay.  Let me see if I've got any other gags I can go to here.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Wow.  Sorry.  You've got too many to go through there.  Jesus.  I just can never find what I'm looking for. 
[01:43:30]  Is it computerized for you?  Isn't there something?  I know.  Shouldn't it be able to?  There's 50 just plates.  I know.  It's right in front of my face.  I can't find them.  All right.  Well, that means we have to actually go to the audio.  What?  I didn't say anything.  He's looking for, he's like, where's the audio of her?  And here come the whores.  Oh, one of the templates missing?  Holy mackerel.  Jesus.  Wow.  We.  I'll say three of them.  Wow.  Bravo. 
[01:44:00]  Those are very short skirts.  Not labeled.  We've got three girls that are going to come in.  Who's not, Travis?  What did we negotiate with these fine ladies?  It's all Steve's doing.  I know.  Find out from Steve.  Travis.  Yep.  Hope you want.  Oh, wow.  Look, there's more.  What?  No, I know.  Where did they come from?  Hey, uh, can we, you want to play the actual audio now?  Yeah.  All right.  What is your major malfunction, Nug Nuts?  Oh, come on.  The father's kind of tough on his daughter there. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Because you are a disgusting fat body.  Not that fat.  I think she's trimming down now.  Ouch.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the actual audio is just as good as what we've been doing the last ten minutes.  Here it is.  Yeah, let's actually hear it.  This is unbelievable.  Terry Schiavo's father.  Talking to Terry.  All right, Terry.  It's 3.55. 
[01:45:00]  It's 3.55 on Friday.  How are you, sweetie pie?  Hi.  You got a smile for your daddy?  You got a smile for me?  Yeah?  You're going to give me a smile for me?  No.  You're going to give me a smile for me?  Yeah?  You're going to smile for me?  Yeah?  You're going to say something for me? 
[01:45:30]  Hi, dear.  I didn't even touch you.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you?  Are you okay?  Are you all right?  No. 
[01:46:00]  You, as best, unfuck yourself, or I will unscrew your hair and chip down your neck.  Can you say hello to me?  Can you say hello to me?  Can you say hello to me?  Oh, no shit.  Can you say hi, Dad?  Can you say hi?  Can you say hi?  Why, you little maggots, you make me want to vomit! 
[01:46:30]  Can you say hi?  Now, choke yourself!  Don't pull my fucking hand over there!  I said choke yourself!  Is something hurting you?  Did your parents have any children that live?  So, yes, sir!  How about they regret that?  Bullshit! It looks to me like the best part of you ran down to cracking your mama's ass and ended up with the first stain on the mattress! 
[01:47:00]  When you're just so...  Uh...  Does anything...  Does something hurt?  Uh...  Shut up!  Shut the fuck!  You're all right to take...  Shut up!  Will you shut up!  Shut up!  Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut, shut up!  Is you okay?  Shut up!  Uh...  Does something hurt you?  Uh...  Does your head hurt? 
[01:47:30]  You're so ugly, you can be a modern art masterpiece.  Does anything hurt you?  No.  No, Patty.  Your days of finger-banging, old Mary Jane Rotten-Rots, through her pretty pig, Patty, are over.  Does your nose hurt?  Does your mouth hurt?  Does your back hurt? 
[01:48:00]  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Does your leg hurt?  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop it!  Does your ears hurt?  Stop whining.  It's not a tumor.  Now we're having fun.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[01:48:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I want to eat your pussy if you want me to fuck you.  If you want me to stick my fingers in your ass, just go.  Oh, old creaky door voice.  Yeah, if you want me to fuck you, sound like a Kawasaki jet ski.  I think they should yank the tube, not because she's not there, just because she's irritating.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  I can't understand a fucking thing she says.  Well.  Uh, wow.  The dude from Jersey says, now if you play it backwards, she's saying, kill me, you ass. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  Well, there you have it.  I think she is definitely communicating on some level.  I mean, you know.  You think?  Dude.  Yeah.  He's asking her questions.  She's going.  That could just be what, what is, is a human body hooked up to no playlist.  Just kind of, you know, making sounds.  She made the yummy noise.  Did she make the yummy noise?  Yeah.  She's going to be singing putting on the Ritz soon. 
[01:49:30]  What hurts?  Your mouth?  What hurts?  Your ear?  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  Put it on the Ritz.  Put it on the Ritz.  Someone's got to take the Pat O'Brien sex tapes and that audio and come up with a little  ditty for us.  Oh, no.  Why not?  Ah.  Wow, that is really awful.  Just tell Terry you're into her.  Just pretend that you're into Terry.  What an annoying father. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, the same.  Oh, every answer.  What hurts?  Your mouth?  Your ear?  Your back?  What hurts?  What the fuck do you think hurts?  He's like pinching and twisting each one.  Does your nose hurt?  Yeah.  What hurts?  Honk.  Honk.  Whoa.  You should listen a little longer.  Do your nipples hurt?  How about your clit?  Does this hurt?  It's all right.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  Stop.  Quiet.  Phew.  We should take a break.  I finally got a good copy of the Bill Hicks bit. 
[01:50:30]  She sounds like she's auditioning for The Grudge.  Oh, my God.  That was creepy.  She made The Grudge sound.  That's really awful.  Creepy chap movie.  The body of Christ compels you.  The body of Christ compels you.  The body of Christ compels you.  Does your eyes hurt?  Does your mouth hurt?  Does your mouth hurt?  Your mother sucks cocks in hell.  All right.  All right.  Damn me.  Damn me.  Damn me.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  Well, this Bill Hicks bit makes perfect sense today, Anthony.  Sure does.  After listening to the Terry Schiavo audio, we've been talking about this bit for a few  days.  We finally found a good copy.  Listen to this as we go to break.  Hey, man.  Killer idea.  You guys like going to the movies?  Yeah.  Do you do?  Three of you do?  Yeah.  I love the fucking movies.  Love them.  Now, I'm watching Terminator 2.  Did you all see that movie?  Yeah.  Well, I'm watching it. 
[01:51:30]  I'm thinking to myself, you know what?  There's no way they're ever going to be able to top these stunts in a movie again.  You cannot top this shit.  Unless they start using terminally ill people as stunt men in pictures.  Well, hear me out.  I know to some of you this may sound a little cruel. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, Bill, terminally ill stunt people.  That's cruel.  You know what I think cruel is?  Leaving your loved ones to die in some sterile hospital room surrounded by strangers.  Fuck that.  Put them in the movies.  What?  You want your grandmother dying like a little bird in some hospital room?  Her translucent skin so thin you can see her last heartbeat work its way down her blue veins? 
[01:52:30]  Or do you want her to meet Chuck Norris?  Hey, how come you dressed my grandmother up as a mugger?  Shut up and get off the set.  Action.  Push her towards Chuck.  There.  Abrrrr.  Oh!  Shhh!  Shhh!  Wow.  He kicked her head right off her body.  Did you see that?  Did you see my granny? 
[01:53:00]  She's out of her misery.  You've seen the greatest film of all time.  I'm still feeling some resistance to this, man.  What's up?  You and your fake fucking sympathy.  Okay, how about these guys are being executed?  Don't do that.  Poison. 
[01:53:30]  Electrocute.  How cruel.  And unimaginative.  Put them in the movies.  Jeffrey Dahmer,  for your crimes against humanity,  of which you've been found guilty,  I sentence you  to Wes Craven's next picture.  Okay, not one of my more popular theories. 
[01:54:00]  But just do me a big favor.  Don't ever say you love film as much as I.  I think we've found your limit.  Like sand through the hourglass,  so is the O&A virus.  So we're in this conference room  making sure that everything's going to be done.  They're asking all of us individually,  so what's wrong with your part of the studio?  What's wrong with yours, Ann?  What's wrong, Jim?  What's wrong?  Isn't that great?  They're getting everybody's input on what's wrong, 
[01:54:30]  writing it down,  and they're going to fix every problem.  And I believe this was a high-powered meeting, you know?  Yeah.  And...  You know what it is?  It was guys that really don't have time to waste  to sit there and do anything,  but these guys are always doing something around here.  There's plenty of stuff for them to do.  Yeah, because they're taking us very seriously,  and they want the equipment to work fine  when we get back from vacation.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony and Norton spent the whole meeting  staring at Ben's hog.  And laughing like retards. 
[01:55:00]  And laughing like retards.  And that's when I said,  ma'am, this show is in trouble.  This was supposed to be the big meeting  where we take care of all problems.  I tried so hard to take everything seriously,  and then I look over at Jim,  and Jimmy's just pointing.  He's pointing.  Jimmy's to my left,  and Ben was to my right.  And Ben was to my left.  So I look over at Jimmy,  and he's pointing over me.  So I follow his finger,  and he's pointing right at Ben's mule,  which, the way he's been sitting in his pants 
[01:55:30]  was just like puffed up like a jiffy pop  ready to explode right there.  Look how he had the new studio in his pants.  So now I'm staring at it  and just laughing hysterical,  and we're both staring at it.  And Ben realized what we're doing  and became so self-conscious  for the entire meeting.  He then like tried to  like cross his legs  and turn,  he goes,  oh, you guys are assholes.  And like turned his back to us,  and we could still see,  so he tried to hide it with some paper. 
[01:56:00]  But he turns towards Ope,  and Ope goes,  I don't want to look at it.  I don't want to look at it.  Well, no.  He's like, oh, you guys are assholes.  Yeah, he turns toward me  and he goes,  these guys are being dicks.  I got to sit this way.  I'm like, dude,  I don't want to look at it either, man.  So he covers it with some paper,  and after a little while  when he kind of forgot about it,  I just slowly lean over  and started pulling the paper away.  He's like,  duck it off.  And me and Jimmy  are laughing so hard,  I was crying.  I had tears going down my face.  And the guys in the meeting  were so pissed off,  they just finally were like, 
[01:56:30]  well,  is there any other problem  or is this meeting  just going to degenerate  and degenerate further?  Further.  And I'm like, no.  And then I try to blame Jimmy.  I go, it's him.  He's making me laugh.  And then Jimmy goes,  it's not me.  It's Ben's fuel.  Opian Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  State of the Union.  Gas prices going up again.  The Opian Anthony Show on XM. 
[01:57:00]  Poop goes the weasel.  Ramone,  give me your sleeve.  Big Duty's Jay from Jersey  says, wait a minute,  I know what she's saying.  Then he says,  doing his best Brian Regan impression,  she's lonely. 
[01:57:30]  That's horrible.  If you play it backwards  and listen carefully,  she's saying Jim Norton  at the Fort Lauderdale Improv,  March 24th through 26th.  Call for tickets.  954-981-5653.  Thank you.  Tonight's reception.  Very funny.  Wow.  She sounds like a metal detector. 
[01:58:00]  And it does.  I got to tell you.  Anthony, really fast.  You brought this to our attention  this morning.  I did.  Crime is way, way down  in New York City.  New York City is,  it's fallen off  of all those lists  of crime-ridden cities,  of murder-ridden cities,  really.  It's the homicide rate  in New York City  has gone down  where we're not even  really up there anymore.  Philly's still huge up there.  Oh, they're out of those.  And Chicago. 
[01:58:30]  Houston, I think,  is really huge, too.  Detroit.  It's down south.  Detroit.  D.C. is always big.  Big, big D.C.  Big, big.  New York City.  How about New Orleans?  There were a lot of murders  when we were there.  Based on what I saw  at Mardi Gras,  probably.  Probably right up there.  But New York,  the homicide rate  has really dropped.  I mean,  the numbers are ridiculous.  Yeah,  1990,  there were 2,245 murders.  In one year.  In the year of 1990,  2,000,  over 2,000 murders.  Let's see, 
[01:59:00]  what kind of administration  was in office?  Okay,  now who?  1996,  983.  That's a huge drop.  Sure is.  2004,  570.  Yeah.  And 2005,  they're projecting  under 500 murders.  Under 500.  You go from over 2,000  to under 500  and then you think,  what's different?  Yeah,  what exactly is different  in the type of an administration?  Oh,  I see.  One doesn't grovel 
[01:59:30]  and beg for the votes  of criminals  and one side of the fence  does.  How about hiring  a shitload of police  is what they did.  Yep.  Put them out on the streets.  Years ago,  you used to walk around  New York,  man.  It was,  you know,  you saw cops  but not that many.  You could be somewhere  in the city  and not see a cop.  These days,  anywhere you are  in the city,  you look around,  you will see a cop.  There are cops everywhere.  It also really made  the city safer.  I also think it has  something to do  with the economy. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah,  New York's economy  was in the shithole  for quite a few years.  Here's the observation  I want to make.  There are people  out there  right now  that have jobs  that are serving you.  They are serving you  your burger  at McDonald's possibly  or your fries  or they're giving you,  I don't know,  selling you newspapers  or give me some  of those other jobs  there,  Anthony.  What,  shitty jobs?  Yeah,  pretty much the shitty  jobs out there.  The bottom of the rung jobs.  Pumping your gas.  Pumping your gas.  Thank you,  Jimmy.  Delivering your food. 
[02:00:30]  Exactly.  Insert bad job here.  But they got these jobs  because the economy  is doing pretty well  these days,  okay?  Those same people  that you have contact  with right now  as we speak,  if the economy  was different,  would be killing you.  Would be murderers.  There are people  that have the potential  to kill  that are out there  serving you.  Yeah.  That would have been  one of the 2,000 murderers  had they not  turned things around 
[02:01:00]  here in New York.  And all it's going to take  is the economy  to drop again  and these same people  that are serving you  now have to make  some kind of living  and have to,  you know,  get the food on the table  or what have you,  whatever,  and they will now  be killers.  Robbing,  killing,  sure.  Oh,  that's a nice  little thought to have.  But the argument  could also be made  that a big problem  is that the police  and the quality  of life crimes  that Giuliani  went after  that everybody  said he was a Nazi,  that all of that  cut down on what 
[02:01:30]  is a comfortable  criminal environment  makes it harder.  It really does.  The economy  does make a difference  though.  But all those  quality of life things  and getting,  you know,  a boost in the economy  down in Times Square,  everyone goofs on it  and says it stinks  and it's Disney  down there.  What did it used to be?  It used to be  porno stores  at every corner.  Drug dealers,  pimps.  Drug dealers all over  the place.  The good old days  I like to call it.  Remember when  Central Park  was a joke  about getting  mugged or raped?  It was Central Park.  That was the joke. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, you walk  through Central Park.  Now people there  all the time.  You know,  occasionally you still  have a nice little  fun thing  happening there.  But for the most part  it's very safe.  But a lot of the crimes  that are nothing  to do with the economy  like a lot of the  violent crimes,  for instance,  drug crimes.  Most drug dealers,  I mean,  they're pulling in  five grand a day.  I don't care how  good the economy is,  some guy from a  depraved,  very poor neighborhood  or any neighborhood  is going to be  hard pressed to pass  up the opportunity  to make five grand  a day and drive a  Lexus that he paid 
[02:02:30]  for with cash.  That type of violent  drug gang interaction  is not basically  economy based.  Well, of course not.  You'll always have that.  But I'm talking about  those fringe players.  Yeah.  They try to get a job  and then they don't  get the job because  the economy sucks,  so they have to do  something and they  decide, well,  instead of going to  McDonald's or what  have you every day,  I'm going to go down  the crime route.  A little bit of crime.  And you're in  contact with those  people.  Yeah.  They have it in them.  When you go to that  fast food restaurant  today, that person,  if the economy wasn't  doing as well as it is,  could be the next 
[02:03:00]  murderer in New York  City.  Not the fast food  place I go to.  Of course not.  Whitney Houston in  rehab.  Anyone care?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Again or still?  Whitney Land back in  rehab.  Man, Bobby Brown  fucked her up.  She had a pretty good  career going for herself.  I've had enough of  both of their awful  lives, him and his  stupid abuse and  drunk driving and  her and her fucking  cold.  Who cares?  We're sweating.  Excuse me, can I  finish?  Oh, I'm sorry,  Hope.  Put on your laughing 
[02:03:30]  hats, everyone.  Because this is how  it's being reported  in the New York  paper.  Whitney Land's  back in rehab.  That's the headline.  The first line in the  article says,  Houston, we have a  problem.  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  That's terrific.  Because it's Whitney  Houston.  Eric, I understand  there's whores out  there.  You don't have to keep  tapping me on the  shoulder.  Jesus Christ.  I'd like to get them  in.  Are they coming in?  What?  I understand.  I didn't see it,  Eric.  Why don't you point 
[02:04:00]  to me?  I missed that, too.  I didn't see it.  Eric's such a rookie.  What are they now  doing videos for Poe  over there in the  corner?  Why do they go back  over there?  Why are they back  over by Poe?  They're going to the  bathroom.  Oh, they're going to  the bathroom.  Again, why are they  here?  I heard from everybody  that Poe was snapping  as they were coming  in.  I was taking some  pictures.  I guess, you know,  you put them on the  computer at home,  check them out, do  whatever you need to  do.  Just that little thing. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Jimmy, don't  toy with it.  Wait, we've got to  get the other side of  this issue because  Scott in Nashville is  very pissed off.  Go ahead, Scott.  Oh, Jesus.  Scott, go.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  At least you show  every day.  It's great, but the  only problem I got is  when little Jimmy  starts talking to him  and I love you,  little Jim.  Thank you.  You're completely  wrong about the  Republican and  Democrat in New  York on how the  crime rate now is  low.  That's pretty naive.  I mean, there's a  lot of other factors 
[02:05:00]  into it.  All right.  Let us.  In the early 90s,  there was, you know,  crack was running  rampant and the  government more or  less turned a blind  eye to it.  And then it was in  94, 95 when Clinton  signed into law, you  know, the extra  million police officers  in the whole U.S.  that Bush has now  cut.  There's a lot of  contributors to that.  Dude, I know there  are, but you've got to  realize I've been here  in and out of New York  for years and I saw  the difference in the  city.  And I'm not just  talking about, you  know, murders, but the 
[02:05:30]  little quality of life  things and all the  things that typically  Republicans aren't  afraid.  Look, let's be honest.  Republicans are more  law and order type of  people and Democrats are  more for social programs.  It's just basically the  nature of the parties.  The Dinkins-Giuliani  administration, the  difference has been  amazing.  Yeah, Dinkins was  atrocious.  Koch was very corrupt  and I like Ed Koch, but  he had too long in New  York.  He had, what, 16 years  as mayor, I think it  was.  I mean, I don't live in  New York.  I'm sure you all have a 
[02:06:00]  better grasp on it than  me, but just to bundle it  up and say, you know,  Democrats, Republicans,  man, there's a whole lot  more to it than that.  Bravo.  And I'm not saying  Bravo, Scott.  Bravo.  Help me out in here,  will you?  I'm not saying that  Democrats are for  criminals or they want  to see.  I just think they stress  things less than  Republicans because,  again, they are very  afraid of being  misconstrued as racist  or very construed of  putting dollars into a  police department instead  of social programs.  So, I mean, that's where  a lot of the differences  come in.  That's why I think with  Republicans, you see more  law and order. 
[02:06:30]  We wouldn't need so many  police if we had better  educational programs.  Shut up.  More cops on the street.  Lock everyone up.  Democrats are more for  finding a root cause  where Republicans are more  about personal  responsibility and  fuck the root cause.  We're going to  shut your head off  for doing it.  Yeah, while they're  finding the root cause,  you're being killed  or raped.  Fine.  More cops.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love having cops  out there.  I do.  Thank you.  Although there's...  Shut up.  Thank you.  There's an argument  to be made that the  economy and without  a poverty, a poor  neighborhood, the more 
[02:07:00]  money you put into  these awful neighborhoods  that build them up,  the less crime builds  up because people are  getting educations.  I mean, that's  certainly a value  argument, too.  You've got to put the  cops out there first.  I agree.  Clean them up.  All right.  So Whitney's in  rehab.  Sorry.  That's my new  impression.  Do you like it?  It's pretty easy.  I think I can do that  one.  Save your voice.  I'll do that one for  you.  Danny's not here, 
[02:07:30]  Mrs. Torrance.  Terry, she's the  little girl that lives  in my mouth.  Stalker Patty wants to  come in and say hi.  She likes to do this  before vacation.  Can I ask why Stalker  Patty is coming in the  studio and the three  tens are sitting outside?  Yeah.  Why?  We're going to do it all.  We're going to do it all.  We're getting Stalker Patty  out of the way.  Because the girls are  in the bathroom.  I'm smart.  They're not in view  anymore, which means  they're off doing  something.  I'll bet you they're  dropping.  I'll bet you one's  going, oh my God,  that's a double flusher. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, Anthony, we got a  lot of requests for the  Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  We started the show off  today, but I'm getting a  lot of email.  People want to hear the  remixes that people are  coming up with so far.  Well, the listeners  aren't coming up with  them yet.  We got one in from the  listeners.  We want you to take the  sex tapes and do  something with it.  And you got to get it in  tomorrow because tomorrow's  our last live show  before vacation.  But Danny and Derek  and a guy named Joe  did some fine stuff  with the sex tapes.  Yes.  Why don't we start  with Derek's?  Save message Sunday  7.09 p.m. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, it's me.  You know what's wrong  with me and why I'm  like this?  But I want to fuck.  I want to fuck  and go crazy.  I'm just so funny  and in here.  I'm just so fucking  hot.  I want to lift  your pussy.  I'm going to make  you come.  I'm going to suck  your tits.  I want to fucking  make you fucking 
[02:09:00]  crazy.  Look at me and say  yes.  Say yes or wait.  let's go.  I don't want you  badly.  I know you want me.  Let's just fucking  have fun.  Forget this.  Let's just go to the  bathroom.  I'll leave you a  push now.  Bye.  I want to suck 
[02:09:30]  and put me  fuck dirty  to you  beat off  your face.  I'm so tired  of her.  It's so fucking  hot.  You're a  fucking hot.  I want to fuck you.  I want to fucking 
[02:10:00]  go crazy with you.  Go crazy.  I want to fucking  go crazy with you.  You have no more  messages.  Yeah, the girls are  warming up.  We're going to get  them in here in a few  seconds here.  But there's an example  of what someone did  with the Pat O'Brien  sex tapes.  By the way, that's  another reason we  can't get them in.  We've got to get all  the blinds down and all  that crap.  What?  What?  What's happening?  Nothing.  And then, Anthony,  a listener sent this  one in.  Just giving examples 
[02:10:30]  because we're hoping  we get more overnight  before we go away on  vacation.  This was Joe.  He put this one  together.  This guy cannot  control himself.  He's got to call  this woman and  kill her.  Let's get crazy  with some coke.  God, you're so  fucking hot.  I'm so fucking  in here.  It's incredible.  I'll make you  come.  I'm so fucking 
[02:11:00]  in here.  But I want  to fucking  make you crazy.  You're so  fucking hot.  I want to  fucking eat you  and fuck you  and suck your  tips.  I fucking  want to  fucking 
[02:11:30]  make you crazy.  The worst  part is  fucking  a girl  named  Betsy.  I wanted  to knit  a flag  and I  eat  your  cunt.  God  damn.  That is  great.  How embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  That's really  good, huh?  That's great.  And then  the final one  for today  and hopefully  we'll have 
[02:12:00]  more tomorrow.  I'm thinking  Terry Schiavo  audio and  Pat O'Brien  sex tapes.  I'm thinking.  I think you're  right.  Maybe we could  get the Terry  Schiavo audio  up on Foundry  so they can  take that and  do what they  will.  Run with it.  There's been  any Foundry  I'm sorry  a whack bag  photoshops of  Pat O'Brien  and Schiavo.  I'm surprised  there haven't  been any of  them if there  haven't been.  Oh, I'm sure  there will be.  Yeah.  Finally,  Anthony, Danny  who works for  us for free  who's in  studio getting  ready to film  the fine  young ladies.  Why doesn't  Danny come in? 
[02:12:30]  He's in the  control room.  He's right there.  That's Danny.  Oh, hi.  I thought you were  Travis.  It's Danny.  This is my  favorite, by the  way.  No offense to  Derek who did  a great job on  his as well.  Oh, wow.  I like the  creativity here.  Whipping the  bird to him.  It's all right.  Getting a little  acceptance and  running with it.  Save message  Sunday, 9.04  PM.  You're so  fucking hot.  I have a  big cock.  I want you to  suck it.  I told Betsy,  Betsy's so jealous.  If you agree  with this,  when I see you, 
[02:13:00]  walk by me in the  hallway,  don't punch me  in the face.  I want to get  Betsy and then  just pick up  Jane Mansfield's  head and eat it.  If you're into  this, just breathe  while you're in  the office.  Oh, I just  want to put  white powder in  an envelope and  dump it your  face and  fuck you off.  Betsy needs a  hooker's ass.  If you want to  fuck my cock,  just look at me  stupidly and  kind of half-smile.  Very good.  A lot of  photoshops of  Jimmy in  gangsta attire.  Oh, really?  I didn't see  any of those.  Being a wigger. 
[02:13:30]  And then there's  Peterson Boy  stuffed peppers  from yesterday's  show.  And then a lot  of people had  fun taking the  promotional picture  of me and  Opie and then  really photoshopping  it badly.  It looked like  they turned your  eyes upside down.  I saw that  yesterday.  I was laughing  pretty hard.  By the way,  I don't know if  you understand that  Terry Shiva was  an Opie and  Anthony listener.  Oh!  They found a  wow sticker and  it stood for  Waste Away  Wednesday. 
[02:14:00]  God, the  obsession.  Isn't that a  wow sticker?  No, it's like  a two or an  at.  Oh, wow?  Like, wow.  Waste away.  Oh!  W-A-W?  Oh, shit, yeah.  Would that be a...  Waste away on  Wednesday.  There we go.  There we go.  It's called a  printing place.  Whoa!  Can we get...  Can we get...  Can we get...  Can we get...  Can we get...  Can we get...  Can we get Stalker Patty  in here to do her  thing real fast?  Then we're going to  bring the ladies in.  Good. 
[02:14:30]  Stalker Patty.  Does she have to show up  every time?  No.  She heard DD on the  radio the last couple  of days.  She's feeling a little  threatened.  Real girls out there.  I want to see these  girls.  Yeah, they're ready to go  in a few minutes.  I don't want to see  hummingbird teeth.  Hello.  Hello, yeetie.  That's a fantastic outfit  in 1971.  What the hell are you  wearing?  It doesn't even match.  I can't help being my age.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Besides, I don't have...  I can still shop in the  pre-teens and regular 
[02:15:00]  like department for like  teenagers and I just  laugh.  So do I.  Not only for clothes  but for books and other  emotional things.  You're funny.  Stalker Patty, you know  that Dee Dee is becoming  a star on this program.  I think she's awesome.  I'm enjoying her.  She's the best news  person, I think.  And we get a lot more  out of her.  She talks about having  sex in the butt.  She talks about  blacking out.  Yes.  Well, I've always had 
[02:15:30]  my wits about me.  But by the way, this is  for you guys.  But no, don't give it  to Opie.  I didn't see any of  the last batch.  Where did that go?  Well, give it to you.  Where did that go?  Give it to Anthony first.  Where did it go?  Can I have a piece of  chocolate patty?  Is that possible?  Yes.  What are these?  They're truffles.  Milk chocolate truffles.  Whole ten of them.  They are.  But that's enough for  everybody, too.  Two.  Oh.  Grab one.  Nice.  Pass them around.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Thanks, Patty. 
[02:16:00]  Is that it?  Hey, Flok, could you  bring me one of those  for my fat face?  I brought my pictures  from childhood, which I  haven't seen in years.  I never look at them.  You've got to scan them  and put them up on the  website.  Yeah.  You want to see the  pictures real fast?  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Yeah, let me see.  All right.  Patty, you see what a  real girl looks like,  by the way?  Oh.  Wow.  Yeah, they're really hot,  aren't they?  Yeah, a little intimidating.  They are, because they're  curvy and voluptuous.  This is the earliest photo  I have. 
[02:16:30]  These are my earliest photos.  Hold on, let me talk to  Ads and M whenever he  feels like it.  Ads and M.  Yeah, I was between two  and four in those pictures.  Oh, my God.  That's my real father,  by the way.  The last picture taken.  One of the foregrounds  running.  This was the last time  he saw you, I bet.  No, he saw me a couple  times up until around  8th, and I didn't see  him, then found out he  died.  No one told me.  What a pedophile-looking  guy he is. 
[02:17:00]  He was 52 years old,  53 years old.  He was born in 1904.  What happened to him?  I died of heart failure  from smoking.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Wow.  All right, that was a  real baby, baby picture,  so we can't really, I want  to see some ones where  you're stuck kind of  looking like yourself  now.  All right, here's my  8th grade graduation  photo. 
[02:17:30]  That voice goes right  through you.  Oh, my God.  Isn't it just God  awful?  And this is my  graduation photo from  college.  She looks exactly the  same.  8th grade, and that's  college.  Oh, my God, you look  exactly the same.  Yeah.  And then these are  some...  She hasn't changed  from 8th grade.  Yeah, and then these  are just other photos  of me at 14, 16,  whatever.  Oh, yeah, that one  right there.  And then I'm about  23 years old.  No, 20 years old I was. 
[02:18:00]  Patty, you weren't, um...  You were definitely  molestable.  You weren't that bad  looking back in the day.  No.  What happened back  in the day?  What do you mean  what happened?  What do you mean?  I take good care of  myself.  I need a better chair.  She wasn't bad  looking.  She looks like Stein  from the Bad News  Bears.  Yeah, I hated my...  That was the  graduation photo.  I didn't like too  much.  All right, I found  the photo to talk  about.  Oh, she's...  Why are you in a  class photo where  you're at least two  feet taller than 
[02:18:30]  everyone else in the  class?  Uh-oh.  I worked in a  nursery school for a  year.  Oh.  And all those kids...  Doesn't it look like  she's one of the  students at a school?  That was left back  a few years?  Those kids are now  your listeners.  You know, that's how  old they were at that  age.  What year is this?  82.  And then this is me  at age 20.  On the back of your  picture here, it says  college yearbook photo,  senior year, aged 23.  A-G-E-D, 23.  Yeah.  Patty, I would like to  make fun of you, but  I mean, the pictures  are not bad at all. 
[02:19:00]  Are there any other  geek from this time?  You should really be  banging out there.  You know, the glasses  really stink.  I know.  I mean, I'm looking  at these, they're really  bad old lady glasses.  That's my cat.  That's my baby.  That's Evie.  I'm up.  That one high school,  that one graduation  photo of you is  atrocious.  That's the only bad  one, is that one.  They're really not that  bad.  Just that one Rocky  Dennis hairdo one you  have?  It's Rocky Dennis.  Yeah, this one?  No, no, no, that one  right there.  Oh, this one, my 
[02:19:30]  eighth grade graduation.  Oh, is that awful?  I know it is.  You know, what can I  say?  Well, I think I look  good now.  I take good care of  myself.  I don't...  Aged 20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You look pretty much  the same.  Which means I'm doing  something right.  My diet, you know, I  try to live a healthy  lifestyle.  I don't want to look  old.  Patty, you want to get  naked with the girls?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  I feel like...  You want to have some  lesbian action with the 
[02:20:00]  girls?  No.  You want to get naked  with the girls?  It'll be fun.  No, I feel...  How about they show  you how to have an  orgasm?  Let's bring the girls  in.  Let's start our  negotiation.  See these high school  pictures?  Get the girls in here.  It's right before  she shot Garp.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, that's it.  What a psycho you  look like.  That was my bus  picture to get me  on the bus.  You were cute, though.  You look like you  should be cradling some  dying person in the  parking lot of Kent  State.  Aw.  Okay.  Oh, there you go.  Another one of these.  Yeah, those milk  chocolate truffles are out 
[02:20:30]  of this world.  They're the best one  of.  You think so?  Yeah.  I thought that they...  Here come the girls.  Right in here.  Right in here.  Like they're dogs  or something, Eric.  Jesus, be nice to them.  Wow.  Ladies.  We need to mic them.  Want a truffle?  Yes, please.  That's good stuff.  You guys want truffles?  The only problem is  you're going to have to  eat out of each other's  snatches.  All right, listen.  We've got to mic the 
[02:21:00]  girls.  What's going on here?  We didn't get a  microphone?  Oh, we keep eating  them like an animal.  Where's Ben?  Or Eric?  We need a microphone.  They're just babbling  over there.  Eric, we need a mic.  Get a mic, Hawk.  Where's Ben?  Ew, it's Brittany.  Huh?  Ew, it's Brittany.  What, you guys don't  like Brittany?  I love Brittany.  You love Brittany Spears?  Danny, give them a  microphone.  A hero?  Patty's done for now.  I don't like him.  Take your pictures, Patty, 
[02:21:30]  just so they don't get  stepped on.  Move your photos.  So they don't get damaged.  Yeah, Patty.  All right, get those  photos.  You're going to have to  let Steve scan them so  we can put them up on  the website.  You have to sit there  because they're going to  use that area.  I don't want to.  Yeah, sit over there,  Patty.  Move your thing next  to Anthony.  Hi, ladies.  Great.  Ladies?  Hi.  Hi, girls.  You're all going to  have to, when you talk,  you're going to have to  really get up close to  that microphone.  Like this?  Yeah, so we can hear you.  Very good.  We have three lovely ladies  in this studio. 
[02:22:00]  Your hands are cool.  This is a very big  microphone.  Yes.  I'm glad Danny's actually  just holding the microphone  so I can't see the girls.  I know.  Isn't that awful?  Oh.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, hold that up.  Can you squat and hold it,  Danny, so I can look at  the beautiful girls?  I feel like you're  sitting next to you.  Oh, he wants you to squat.  Well, you're...  Now, we got one.  I don't know your names  or anything.  What's your name,  the tall girl?  Pink Snow.  Pink Snow.  Tall blonde.  That's right. 
[02:22:30]  With big boobies.  Wow.  Snow mountains.  Yes.  How tall are you?  5'9".  5'9".  Very nice.  Who else do we have?  With the pigtail blonde hair?  I'm Crystal Swarovski.  Really?  Yes, I am.  Is that your real ass name  or am I not getting a joke?  What?  That's my real name.  That's your real ass name?  That's my real ass name.  What, are you Russian?  I'm Polish.  How many times  have you spelled it wrong?  No one takes Swarovski  or this page name?  I haven't spelled it wrong  in a very long time.  Well, that's good. 
[02:23:00]  That's good.  You're Polish?  Yes.  Were you born here  or in Poland?  I was born in Chicago.  Born in Chicago.  Yes.  A lot of Polish people  in Chicago.  Yes.  Yeah.  And parents from here  or Poland?  Chicago.  From Chicago.  Yes.  And you came,  do you live in New York?  I live in New York.  I live in Bensonhurst.  Brooklyn.  Yes.  Nice.  All right.  And then,  who else do we have?  Trixie Doll.  Trixie Doll.  She's a short one.  She's a little pixie.  Petite. 
[02:23:30]  I'll say.  How tall are you?  4'11".  4'11".  She's got very high skills.  And how old a gal are you?  I'm 21.  Yes, you are.  You're 21.  Wow.  And where do you hail from?  I met you 10 years ago.  California.  Yes, sir.  What part of California?  If I told you,  you wouldn't know.  I might.  Lancaster.  Lancaster.  You're right.  I have no clue.  Is that southern, northern?  That's southern.  Southern?  Between L.A. and Mojave.  Oh, really? 
[02:24:00]  Out there.  All right.  I know.  I kind of know.  Like L.A. and Mojave.  So, Barstow's out there.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  And what else is out there?  Baghdad,  that old desert town of Baghdad.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh,  yeah,  I've been out there.  Yeah.  I used to go camping out in the Mojave.  I lived in San Juan Capistrano  where the swallows come back.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I know.  Tell me about it.  I also lived in Laguna Beach,  though.  That's kind of cool.  Right?  No?  Nothing.  Sort of.  Follow what?  Ah, nice. 
[02:24:30]  So,  feeding you lines over there.  She's eating chocolate  and being fed lines by the other two.  Mm, chocolate's great.  I just want to know which one is which.  Okay, think about it.  Can you Opie and Anthony?  Opie and Anthony.  Who do you think would be Opie?  Him.  Right.  And then I'm the Anthony guy.  The one that looks like Opie.  Right.  And then Anthony,  and that's our own little Jimmy Norton.  No, he doesn't look like Opie.  Jimmy Norton.  Sort of, yeah.  Sure, why not?  That's Jimmy Norton.  And that's Stalker Patty.  Who's going to get naked with you guys?  Hi, Stalker Patty.  She just doesn't know it yet.  Stalker Patty. 
[02:25:00]  How old would you say Stalker Patty is?  21.  21?  No, really.  No.  Really?  How old would you guess her at?  35.  35?  That's what I was going to say.  You were going to say 35?  Mm-hmm.  She's going to be 50 years old.  50 years old.  Happy birthday!  Here's the problem, ladies.  Oh, my God.  And she's a virgin.  She's a virgin.  You're a virgin?  She's never been with a man.  I know.  Isn't that amazing?  Am I allowed to say shit?  Oh, fuck no.  Don't say that.  Ladies, you talk shit.  Lady Norton.  Wow.  Top sucker, motherfucker. 
[02:25:30]  Wow, that's pretty cool.  Goddamn dirty bastard, motherfucker.  Easy, Pat O'Brien.  Ladies, you think you could show Stalker Patty something?  Show her what?  Well, she's a virgin.  She's a little shy.  She's a virgin.  Jen, so we're thinking maybe you could kind of fill her in on what she could do to help  herself out, maybe, or something.  Oh, these two fingers are the best way.  Do you have a dildo?  Patty?  Patty, you have to talk into the mic.  Patty, pull the mic up there. 
[02:26:00]  Uh, no, I did get a, I did get a vibrator as a joke from somebody at a RonFez.net party.  No, it wasn't.  Did you ever put your cucci under the faucet?  Oh, how about that?  Do you do that all the time?  Of course you do.  No, unless you count taking a shower.  And did you put the shower?  She has to go on to the faucet.  Make your voice a little different, because then people would find you more sexy.  Yeah, the voice is really bad, isn't it?  It's like, wow, it's like appreciating my ears.  Oh, someone gave me a vibrator as a joke one. 
[02:26:30]  I know.  You should go to the Pink Snow School of Beauty.  Really?  Yeah, because we could make you beautiful.  Ladies, give her some advice.  You're beautiful now.  You just need to suss up.  What do you do with those, what do you do with those two fingers, by the way?  Yeah.  You insert them.  I know that, but you've got to tell Stalker Patty.  Oh, I know.  This is called helping you ladies out.  Yeah.  Leading you down a path.  Help me out here.  Talk to Stalker Patty about the two fingers and what you do.  Well, you kind of start slow, because it just feels good. 
[02:27:00]  Will you stop laughing?  Well, you need a girl, though.  This is hot.  Yeah.  Isn't that you?  No, it's not me.  Ben doll.  That's Ben.  It's a Ben doll.  Who made one of those?  She started rubbing the hog, which is the meatiest part of the doll.  They got the attention span of gnats.  Oh, I know.  Holy crap.  Ladies, focus.  Focus.  Focus.  Oh, look, something shiny.  I would like to know where in the world a doll came from like that.  Oh, just that. 
[02:27:30]  Way to stay on the topic that's important.  Yeah, hold on.  Ladies, you've got to focus.  ADD.  What does it do for you?  Wow.  You've got to focus, or you guys got to leave, because this is awful.  We think that Patty is...  Help out Stalker Patty with the two fingers.  She needs help.  Okay.  Let's get rid of the doll for now.  You can take it home with you if you need to.  Show us where he touched you on the doll.  They're looking at shiny objects.  They're picking up dolls.  Yeah.  I'm the only pretty doll in here.  You're the doll, right?  She is. 
[02:28:00]  She's beautiful.  She's part of her name, Opie.  You should see her when her shoes are off.  Well, why don't we get her naked, first of all?  I only get naked when I hear music.  How come you two are dressed the same?  Because we're the cheerleaders.  You're the cheerleaders?  For what?  For Eroktica.  For what?  Eroktica.  Eroktica.  What's that?  It is a band we're in.  Oh, you're in a band.  Correct.  Cool.  Would that be the CD I have in front of me?  That is correct.  Can I ask why they said she only gets naked with music, 
[02:28:30]  and no one in there decided to cue up some music?  No, they want to hear their music.  Because it's just a little.  They want to hear their music.  And what do you do?  You play and get naked on stage?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Well, they have sex with girls and stuff, I hear.  Not really.  No, I have sex with girls.  Oh, really?  You have sex with girls on the stage?  No, no, no.  Just in general.  You want to have sex with girls on the party?  Oh, you're a lesbian?  That'd be correct.  Yeah.  You're a good egg.  All right.  The 411 girl is a lesbian.  That's cool. 
[02:29:00]  I try sexual.  I try anything.  Oh, is that it?  Well, we got something for you to try right there.  I don't go that way, though.  I'm straight as an arrow.  You don't go anywhere.  You're not straight.  I would rather be with a guy.  You don't go anywhere.  You're on blocks in the yard.  What are you talking about?  No.  It's okay.  If you went with me, you wouldn't go back.  All right.  Here's the deal.  This is what I want to happen.  I want...  I can't believe I'm about to say this, but...  Oh, I can't either.  You're ruining it.  But I'm not like that.  I'm going to play your CD.  I'm not like that.  I can't believe it.  And one of you girls is going to show Stalker Patty how to pleasure herself on their own 
[02:29:30]  body.  You don't have to touch Stalker Patty.  You can do that.  I hope he's the only one applauding for this idea.  Is she going to get naked and someone's going to touch himself?  The girls naked are going to touch and show them on their own bodies.  They're going to show Patty what to do.  What to do.  Right.  All right.  Let's get Patty over here.  Patty, you got to have a seat in front at least.  Yeah, don't be shy.  Patty, take a seat on the couch. 
[02:30:00]  There you go.  Would she be more...  Since they're filming this, she wouldn't want a mask on, would she?  Oh, she's sitting over there behind Jimmy now.  I thought she was going to go to the couch.  Because you did say the couch.  For some reason, I guess, nah.  She's going to stay there.  How do we get that?  What happened to the mic?  Right here.  Oh, what?  There you go.  I need the cable.  Just cut it.  Look at my coat.  No, just cut it.  I don't care if it makes noise.  Just this.  If you were cut like this and you were naked under it, people would think you were sexy. 
[02:30:30]  Ah, there you go.  Deliver yourself like a present.  Yeah, sure they would.  All right, Stalker Patty is sitting on the couch, Anthony, very stiff.  You can borrow mine sometimes.  Speaking about stiff, look at the view Jimmy has and look at his pants.  All right, Patty's on the couch.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I've wowed and stuff, but...  Of course you have.  What?  I've wowed.  What do you mean by wow?  What does she mean?  That's when girls flash.  Whip them out Wednesday.  That's wild?  But it's Thursday. 
[02:31:00]  Thursday is...  It could also be whip them out whenever.  It's titty Thursday.  There you go.  I'm with you.  I wish one of the days began with P so it could be pussy day.  Hey, there you go.  Well, in the black neighborhood's Friday, though.  P-H.  All right.  Sure.  So far this...  Ladies, so far this stinks, and if we don't have anything happening, we're going to have  to move on because this is a national radio show.  We can't like to sit here and do nothing.  So we have to have somebody nude showing Patty on their body what it is that they suggest. 
[02:31:30]  Exactly.  All right.  Is she going to make it too?  Huh?  That's good.  I got no headphones anymore.  Are you going to make it?  We're going to show how it's done?  Hopefully.  That would be great.  All right.  Patty, take something off.  That's better.  Let's have some music.  Yeah, let's have a little bit of music.  A little something.  Yeah.  Can we actually hear it in here?  Well, you guys aren't going to be able to hear it because it's in our headphones.  Off the CD porn again, it's a band called The Rock.  Is this you singing?  Is this you singing? 
[02:32:00]  It's all right, guys.  I'm not going to sing that.  This is what you're doing.  Is this what you're doing?  Oh.  Why is the one we don't really want to sing?  Okay, then I'll go next.  Why aren't all of them getting naked?  Why aren't all of them getting naked?  Okay, where are you guys?  There's a ring, lady.  Why isn't Opie stomping her guts out?  I don't need a brain.  All right, go ahead, Patty.  Just get naked with the hot tits.  Go ahead.  Everyone.  Everyone get naked.  Everyone get naked. 
[02:32:30]  All right, the girls are getting tired.  Yeah, everyone get naked.  I'm trying so hard.  I love being naked.  Why are the only two naked?  Why is it?  We don't want them to be naked.  Okay, good.  Why?  I got to see them naked.  Let's get.  Everyone gets naked.  Oh, yeah, here we go.  Why is Sucker Patty the only one naked?  How did that happen?  No, nothing.  We don't want to see them.  We want to see all of you naked.  Yeah, everyone.  Let's all get naked.  Let's go, guys.  Come on.  Who's with?  Woo.  Everyone's naked.  I'm the only one taking off my shirt.  Oh, my God.  Who's with me? 
[02:33:00]  Patty's the only one naked.  Oh, wait.  Whoa, hey, the tall one that's singing this song is naked, Anthony.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  With a very nice.  There you go.  Everyone's getting naked.  Set of boobies.  Very nice.  Breast implants looking very nice.  Very nice.  Holy mackerel, are they?  And a good doctor.  Very nice.  Best money can buy.  All right, now the 4'11.  Oh.  Lesbian is naked.  Very nice.  Award-winning dress.  Wow.  Very nice.  Little B-cups.  Little B-cups. 
[02:33:30]  Very petite.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes.  And firm.  Oh.  Yes.  And then the one that's tougher than a box of rocks.  She's now topless, everybody.  The Polish one.  The Polish one, yes.  And Dr. Patty is naked, too.  You're not going to get naked.  This is naked.  Patty, how about dress your underwear?  You don't get naked.  Okay.  I'll find them.  We'll be in here.  All right.  The lead singer of this band is now taking off her pants.  Oh, there we go.  Take off my pants.  Okay.  All right, she's got a nice black bong on. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, if you have to just walk and get a good education, because I've got to practice.  Wow.  How lovely is she?  There we go.  I've got to know what it's like when they actually...  All right, well, the lead singer of this band is almost completely naked now, Anthony.  Naked except for a tiny, tiny little G-string.  That's terrific.  The other two girls have little skirts on, and they're topless.  And Stalker Patty looking very uncomfortable on the couch, topless. 
[02:34:30]  Stalker Patty looks like a rape victim, waiting for her checkup.  Stalker like, we're invited off.  She's scrubbing in a tub right now, playing.  Come on, Patty.  Patty is so uncomfortable.  Take off your belt.  All right, there you go.  So there we go.  We saw Naked by Iraqtica.  Iraqtica.  CD's called Naked.  Oh, no, CD's called Porn Again.  That was Naked.  Wow, that's fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Oh, please.  Cheryl looks like she's in junior high.  All right, what are we doing now, ladies? 
[02:35:00]  We're going to get naked.  No, we're going to get naked.  P-O-R-R.  P-O-R-N.  P-O-R.  P-O-R-N.  Come on, Patty.  This is truly the greatest day ever.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  She could have the nicest hiney I've seen in five years.  She's bending over right there in front of Jimmy.  Yeah, we're getting some video for the website, right, Danny?  Trying.  You got anything on under those skirts?  Maybe.  All right, why don't we take the skirts off, ladies?  That's where I was getting that up.  I was like, well, then might as well take them off, right? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  All right.  Yeah, you guys got to make Stalker Patty.  This is phenomenal.  I think she needs to take her pants off.  Yeah.  Come on, Stalker Patty.  Get down to your underwear, Patty.  Oh, my goodness.  Just your underwear.  You should be embarrassed.  No big deal.  Yeah.  All right, now we got...  Take down your Robert Plant belt and just get down to your underwear.  Jesus Christ.  All right, Patty.  You pull your pants up really high, by the way.  They're not that high.  Don't worry.  Ethel and Rick aren't going to walk in.  Ben just...  Old Fred Mertz pants. 
[02:36:00]  Ben just took a peek and just walked away.  You look like a real star.  All right, well, let's get...  Paris wasn't really...  Oh, Patty.  Don't be embarrassed, Patty.  Didn't you shake your...  Look at all the other nude girls.  Yeah, Patty's got some sexy panties on right now.  What are you wearing there, Patty?  Usually she has awful panties.  Oh, they're ripped.  Patty, are they ripped?  I think Patty...  Yes, they are.  I'm sorry.  Patty was prepared to be naked today.  Those are sexy panties?  Compared to what she usually comes in with?  Yes.  I drive my car with those.  Those are not sexy panties. 
[02:36:30]  That is.  They're all loose.  Patty, when did you buy those?  Patty, give me better panties.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I don't have much of a clothing budget.  Yeah, but panties.  Trying to catch up with bills.  Patty.  Patty has those panties on in some of those pictures she was showing us.  I can't.  Yeah, why don't you...  You have to just take your shoes off.  You're sitting in your underwear, Patty.  You're not naked.  You're not getting your underwear on.  Stop making Terry Schiavo sounds and take your pants off.  It's just like...  Just take your pants off.  It's no big deal.  Look, the girls, they all have their panties on. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, but I'm not one.  I'm not that kind of a girl.  Hey, what does your tattoo say?  It says Bette.  It says what?  Bette.  Bette?  Yes.  What is that?  It's for Bette Midler.  Really?  Correct.  Why would you tattoo Bette Midler's name on your boobie?  Because she's great.  You love Bette Midler?  I love Bette Midler.  Wow.  All right.  She's amazing.  I'm not going to argue with you.  All right.  Patty.  Time to get a picture.  That's good.  Take your sock off, too.  All right.  Come on, Patty. 
[02:37:30]  Come on, Patty.  The girls want to teach you a little something-something.  It's about time.  You're going to be 50.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Patty, you are the most...  I think Patty looks pretty good.  Her ass is not bad.  I've got to say, she's 50 years old.  That is better than 98% of the 50-year-old asses you're going to say.  Start taking her clothes off.  But the next scene should be her walking into a boxcar.  That's really nice.  You just really...  Please step into the shower chamber.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How do you mean...  It could be the nicest action I've seen in Six Moms. 
[02:38:00]  I like that, Jimmy.  No, it makes me happy to be alive.  That would be me.  Crystal.  Crystal.  Crystal.  Crystal.  You do porn.  I don't do porn.  I throw sex parties.  What's a sex party?  A sex party is a big party where...  Oh, hey, sex party rock.  Yeah.  Sex parties, why?  People send me pictures, and I only take the best-looking, most famous people, and then  they come and they party with me and my friends.  Like Pat O'Brien would send you a picture of him jerking off? 
[02:38:30]  I get pictures of cocks, pictures of titties.  Yeah?  Yeah, they send them to me in the email.  And you invite these people over?  I have big parties for them.  Where?  All over Manhattan, but I won't reveal where.  Only my members know.  And then when they come over, is there a big sex scene happening there?  Yeah.  What's the sex party?  People can submit pictures to me at sexxxclub.yahoo.com.  Se-X-X-X-Club.  Se-X-X-X-Club.  That's my email address, yeah.  Se-X-X-X-Club at yahoo.com. 
[02:39:00]  I'm also a carny.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I walk in broken glass, lay on beds of nails.  Wow.  Do you do the spike up the nose thing?  Yes, I do spike up my nose.  Wow.  Yes.  Did you bring any tricks with you?  No, I wish I did.  I didn't bring any tricks with you.  You ever do the old carny trick of sitting on a comedian's face?  Would you want to sit on Norton's face?  Ladies and gentlemen, stick right up.  It's Jimmy's face. 
[02:39:30]  She'll sit on your face.  As long as she doesn't hurt me.  All right, well, get on the floor.  Get on the floor.  We're trying to get something on here.  Motherfucker.  I can say that on the radio.  Ben's saying no to what?  I can't have my face set on?  Why not?  What are you, high?  Watch me.  Shut that door.  Why don't you just put your face in my...  Okay, I can just put my face in it.  Of course you can.  Okay, now I'm putting my face into it.  Ooh.  Wow.  And she was rubbing her ass all over my face and nose, and it was very lovely.  Did I?  Yes.  That's kind of like a face sit without, like, the entire... 
[02:40:00]  Like, when a girl sits into your face, it really hurts sometimes.  Yeah.  And you want to say, get off when I can't breathe.  But you can't do that.  It's like a face sit on Mars.  Right.  Not much gravity.  Yes, she was kind of floating.  What an ass.  Her ass is fantastic.  Wow.  Thank you.  And you had an up-close view of that, as Ben tried to...  Ben was the whole thing.  Ben was like...  You have a great ass, too, Trixie.  I see nothing wrong with...  No.  Ben was knocking cameras down and knocking digital cameras to the ground.  I can understand if it's other people that aren't supposed to be doing things like that. 
[02:40:30]  That's fine.  But Jimmy...  What's the problem with Jimmy doing?  Just because five girls can sit on Ben's feet with their feet hanging off and not touching  the ground.  Large sit-all.  Sit on Ben's feet?  Yes, you said sit on Ben's feet.  Ben was not happy.  Ben was not happy.  Ben was not happy.  All right.  So what?  The girls are making out on the couch.  Yeah, the girls are making out.  You girls want to have, like, an orgasm contest or something?  We need the grand finale with the ladies.  How about...  We were waiting for Patty to do something.  She's evidently not going to do me.  Well, I think you should instruct Patty in the fine art of self-pleasure. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, definitely.  Right there on the couch.  Definitely.  Wow.  How about the split contest?  Wow.  I can do a split every way across your desk.  That's a very nice split.  No, you haven't seen it yet.  But like I was saying, then you could get your legs far apart, too.  Yeah.  They have to be naked.  Then tell them, Jimmy.  Ladies.  You got a microphone in front of you.  How come you're supposed to be naked showing Patty how to pleasure herself?  No one's doing that.  Wait, we don't care about splits.  Steve said you guys would get naked.  And here's...  Miss?  Hold on. 
[02:41:30]  Miss?  Pardon me, ma'am.  Pink snow.  Oh, hi, pink snow.  If Steve said you would get naked, then you have to, like, pleasure yourself.  Wow.  Fantastic.  And show Patty how to...  Oh, more naked.  Our listeners demand complete nudity.  Steve, what's going on in here, Steve?  I just won't get it.  Mastery.  Yeah.  We're trying to get the girls naked.  So we can have them...  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe...  Maybe...  Well, these girls, why don't you get those nasty panties off?  Oh, I hate panties.  Yeah, they just interfere with... 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  They have a bunny on them.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's got to go, though.  Yeah.  But hers has a bunny on them.  I know, I know.  And it'll be waiting for you later.  I don't care if it has a fruit monkey on them.  I have a bunny on the back and a kitty inside.  Let's see the front.  Let's see the kitty.  What is that shaved like?  There she goes.  Oh, my Jesus.  Wow.  Are you sure you're old enough to be in here?  I'm as old as you want me to be.  You're...  Really? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  I don't think you can get a credit card in there.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  If I...  That's like hair that's just started growing in last week.  Yeah.  Turn around to the boys in the booth.  Thank you.  And she's a lesbian, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, so sad.  Lost one to the other team.  Yeah.  It's all right, though.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Oh, that's lovely.  Wow.  All right.  That's great.  Well, take a seat on our fine couch.  Oh, my God.  And, oh, don't you go anywhere, Miss Polish Girl.  Because those panties are so... 
[02:43:00]  They're just interfering with...  They really break up the line of your beautiful body, I think.  It shows my emotion.  With the skull on the front?  This is the way I feel.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, she makes a nice, angry face.  That's pretty good.  She's angry.  Yeah.  We have to...  We're angry at those panties, aren't we, guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boo for panties.  Boo.  Boo for panties.  Boo for underpants.  Yeah.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Can I take them off? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, you can.  Yeah.  You certainly can.  Yeah, take those off.  The 411 lesbian that's completely naked with a fine ass.  Wow.  Has now taken the panties off the Polish broad from Chicago.  Hey.  Hey, why didn't you take those panties off?  Hey, take my panties off.  I'll stick a pencil in your fucking eye, Sydney.  Hey, that's fantastic.  She's all she.  There ain't no hair on that snatch.  Oh, my goodness.  Is she...  Oh.  Wow.  Oh.  Fantastic.  Hey, I don't see no hair on that snatch whatsoever. 
[02:44:00]  S-E-X-X-X.  All right, Patty.  It's your turn.  That's fantastic.  Yahoo.com?  Hey, Patty.  Patty.  You're going to email me?  All right, listen.  I'm plugging you on the air so they can email you.  Oh, yes, you are.  All right, listen.  Are we going to get...  I beg so much.  I know.  Are we going to have the orgasm contest, ladies?  Yeah.  We have to have the grand finale.  All right, we want you girls to show Patty, because she has no clue, show Patty the fine  art of self-pleasuring and pleasuring each other, things like that. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, spank Patty.  Patty, bend over.  Of course, she's going to get spanked.  Patty, bend over.  Bend over.  It's silly.  You've got to take your pants down.  You can keep your pants and panties on.  Oh, my God.  This is the most...  Oh.  Patty getting spanked.  Why is this something that's supposed to be hot and it's just not?  Wow.  All right, don't mic Patty's ass.  Mic her mouth.  Thank you.  I can't stop laughing. 
[02:45:00]  All right, here we go.  Spank Patty.  I think she needs to.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  But she has no pants on.  You know what?  I was the first human being to actually touch...  Wow, Patty is being raped.  Pretty much a rape going on here in the studio.  They're forcing Patty's pants on.  This belt is really ugly.  I don't think... 
[02:45:30]  I would actually...  It came with the pants.  Oh, Patty.  Patty.  Patty.  That's what they call me.  Patty.  She's a freak.  Oh, come on.  She's a freak.  She's a freak.  I'm not...  Patty.  Oh, come on.  Patty's being raped.  I don't like that.  That's what they call me.  That's what they call me.  That's a good person.  Can she touch your nipples?  I was the first person to ever touch Patty's nipples.  Yeah, you are.  Oh, please.  Yeah, I remember that.  I was the first person alive to touch Patty's nipples.  Go ahead.  Feel like Patty.  I remember that.  Stop.  Come on.  Can one of the girls just touch Patty's nipples?  Because I was the first person to ever... 
[02:46:00]  Just really gently.  They'll be nicer than I was.  Hey, Patty.  Just for a second.  They're not going to hurt you.  They're not going to hurt you.  Oh, look at her.  She's all...  Oh, I'm sick of it.  They're touching Patty.  Jimmy, we didn't say for you to get in on the action.  She offered me.  Oh.  I didn't ask.  She offered me.  Wow, there's some love going on in the corner.  I see that, Anthony.  Whoa, my goodness.  Beautiful.  She's rubbing that ass.  All right, why don't we get the grand finale?  Yeah, girls, if you could maybe pleasure yourselves and each other  and show Patty how it's done, that'd be great. 
[02:46:30]  Who wants to have an orgasm live on the air today?  You do!  Well.  Too late.  Yay!  It's an Anthony show.  They don't want to hear me.  I guarantee that.  So, ladies, let's go for your second guess.  Why don't the three is recline on the couch and just go to town?  There you go.  There you go.  Who wants to have an orgasm for a national radio audience today?  I remember begging like this years ago.  Why don't you guys huddle and decide who gets the orgasm?  Yay!  All right, the tall lead singer of the band, E-Rocktica. 
[02:47:00]  You guys can't fake it, though.  This is the real deal.  One of you guys has to have an orgasm.  Of course it's real.  All right.  You guys have it figured out?  You know what?  The best orgasm of my life is recorded on that CD you played, track one.  And pinksnow.com is your website.  But you can hear another real one right here.  I'm plugging it.  pinksnow.com, right?  Is your website?  That's correct.  And E-Rocktica.  It's called Intro.  All right, let's get into the orgasm.  And this will be the grand finale for the girls. 
[02:47:30]  Sweet, Eric, can you slide?  Oh, you have to hold the mic.  Okay, thanks.  E-Rocktica.  All right, the girl is losing her panties.  Pink snow.  Yeah, she's taking a moment.  She's going to take her panties off.  Okay, yeah.  Pink snow of E-Rocktica.  Yeah, why don't you talk everyone through this here?  Let's go.  All right.  Come on.  All right, now.  Trixie is pulling off the panties.  Mm-hmm.  It's going over the stiletto.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, look at those.  Oh, my God, is she sexy.  Very nice.  Okay.  Okay.  I think I'll lay this way. 
[02:48:00]  All right, she's going to lay across.  She's laying back into my lap.  Yes, I see that.  Okay.  Her face is very close to my vagina.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  All right.  The other girl has mounted the tall blonde, I think.  Okay.  They're kind of getting to know each other a little bit.  Push down on me a little bit.  Eric, you might want to mic the girls. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  Miking the girls.  Get in there, Danny.  Good boy.  Danny's taking medical footage.  Are you watching, Patty?  Patty, do you want to...  Patty, you can get in there if you like.  Yeah, sure she does.  This is an opportunity of a life, Danny.  You can touch pink snow.  All right, they're now making out, Anthony.  Wonderful. 
[02:49:00]  Fuck.  Okay, the 4'11 lesbian girl is now making out with a very tall blonde.  Why can't we whack our brains in here?  I want the girls to make out and just rub each other's pussies, and I want to jerk off  in their face, and I, uh, if that's okay, uh, have red hair and blonde hair.  All right, are we getting, uh...  Well, you need a black-haired girl and we'd be the witches of Eastwick.  Who wants to be Jack Nicholson? 
[02:49:30]  The witches of porn.  Porn from Monaco.  Shut up!  Shut up!  How did you focus?  You feeling that?  These girls are sexy, man.  Yeah, the one girl is rubbing her, uh, her kitty on the other girl.  They're kind of bumping...  You're standing.  They're bumping donuts right now. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, it's a whole straddling thing going on.  The girl's, um...  She's just rocking back and forth on top of the girl.  The 14-year-old is on top of, uh, the one that is of age.  The lead singer has a very, very nice pussy.  Oh, you like that thing?  Oh, it's thick, yeah.  Yeah.  There's boobies everywhere.  All right, close your eyes.  Make believe we're not here.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's hear the story.  Let's go.  Come on.  Keep going.  Wow.  She's digging it.  That's hot.  We're getting all of it on tape. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  That chick's got some moves, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  They're rubbing.  They're rubbing.  They're rubbing mounds.  Their mounds are rubbing together.  Oh, Jimmy, stop it.  Why can't Terry Schiavo enjoy this, too? 
[02:51:00]  Uh.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  We're getting close to something, I think.  The hooker is rubbing on Betsy.  Yeah.  Grab Betsy's tits.  Uh-oh.  Betsy.  I hope Pat O'Brien doesn't get XM on our radio in rehab.  Sure, I can often rehab.  All right.  Oh.  This rehab room looks like an explosion at the old strudel icing factory. 
[02:51:30]  Like a cave that's stuck hanging around the ceiling.  Oh, something's happening.  Oh, yeah, we have to go.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  Forget Aristotle and Socrates. 
[02:52:30]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Who saw this coming?  Anthony?  You know a little bit about everything?  Uh-huh.  What just happened there?  Oh, my God.  Well, Opie, I think every guy in here has a rod.  Yeah.  Wow.  You, too.  The slow applaud is definitely in effect.  They're applauding the other booth.  I've never seen.  Who are all these guys?  I don't know.  Are those guys with the girls or are they interns? 
[02:53:00]  Look at them now.  They're actually cuddling like little Jimmy and Bobby Plant in that picture.  Well, I've got to say, these girls are courtesy of Tim from Erotic Expo New York.  The Erotic Expo New York is May 19th through May 21st at Penn Plaza Pavilion.  I know I'm going to that.  So if you can make that May 19th through May 21.  We'll be there.  And Pink Snow is from the group Erotica.  Erotica.  Erotica.  Okay.  Oh, you're right.  Erotica.  Erotica.  It's a good easy word to say.  No kidding.  www.pinksnow.com. 
[02:53:30]  And Trixie and Krista are from Erotica.  It says Krista on the paper.  Yeah, Trixie.  Yeah, Trixie and Crystal are from Erotica.  Hey, the girl that had the orgasm.  What are you thinking now?  I think I'd like to fuck again.  Wow.  The next time, some cock.  Oh, Jesus.  Dan just said the redhead is soaking wet.  I'm thinking this is a great fucking show.  Yeah, that was a fine orgasm.  We can say fuck on this show.  Well, yeah.  Fuck.  Anything else from the ladies? 
[02:54:00]  I like to fuck.  Wow, that was good.  Did you get anything out of that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to explain.  The little lesbian girl, 4'11", with pretty much the perfect body, she was just rocking.  Yeah, rocking back and forth on her.  That was great.  She was on top just rocking her donut up against the other donut of the girl that was laying.  She's like a little sex toy for you.  Completely on her back.  She is.  She's my living sex toy.  You put her in your pocket and walk around with her when you need her.  You just pop around.  She has a little doll bed in my house.  I put her up above my closet.  It's like a little doll bed. 
[02:54:30]  She sleeps there every night after she comes down.  Yeah, because she's only 4'11", and the girl that had the orgasm is like 5'9", 5'10".  Yeah.  She'd fit great in a trunk.  All right.  A little pink hat.  Yeah, a little pink hat.  A lot of people asking if there's a reaction from Patty.  Patty?  Oh, Patty, that's right.  She's still in the room.  I don't think you've ever seen anything like that live before, huh?  I get an education on the Ophi and Anthony show.  Save that, Steve.  I'm sure we'll hear that in some promo.  There's something for a promo. 
[02:55:00]  They get an education.  She gets her education here.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is where she goes for her education.  That's amazing.  Isn't that sad?  Any other girls want to have an orgasm?  Might as well offer.  I love the lead singer.  She's very sexy.  They're all very sexy girls.  She's still trying to, you know, come to.  She had a real...  She's still out of breath.  She hides her.  She's all red from...  No.  All the other girls set?  I didn't even get a cigarette.  Do you want...  I'm fabulous.  Everyone set then?  All right.  Well, let's hear it for the girls then. 
[02:55:30]  Bravo!  Thank you.  Simply amazing.  Very good, ladies.  Thank you very much.  That was good.  Oh, they're now kissing each other.  How nice.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break, Anthony.  Very friendly with each other.  And we'll continue with the O.P. and Anthony program.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into...  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva. 
[02:56:00]  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good.  I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages...  Savages.  ...that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee. 
[02:56:30]  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay fucking tuned.  Because I'll come and fucking kill your baby pet.  Oh, it's dark in the dark  One step away from you 
[02:57:00]  It's dark in the dark  Always dreaming up on you  I'm right  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, give it to me, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, 
[02:58:00]  and we're back with the O.P. and Anthony program, we, oh okay, I was about to say we lost Jim Norton,  but he's back in the studio, no worries, god, we couldn't get the girls out because they had to get dressed, 
[02:58:30]  there's all these rules now when you're doing this type of radio, it's crazy, it's insane, it's insane, it's nuts,  sex, I got a S-E-X-X-X club at yahoo.com for sex parties, I really do want to go to one of those.  Oh, you're going to go?  Yeah, man, I'm very tempted to check one of those out because it might be one of those things where people just bang  and you can watch it.  That seems to be what they were talking about, it's one of those parties that the, a lot of people having a lot of sex.  As long as you can whack your bag, I don't plan on hooking up.  You just want to go and watch people have sex in a jacket? 
[02:59:00]  Don't play, I'm the creepy guy.  That wasn't bad, got some action in here.  Turned out alright.  Girl on girl action, we got some video, still pictures.  The girls were cool.  They were really nice.  We've been getting away from that type of radio because most of the time the ladies come in and then just do nothing.  So, but they were...  Are they gone?  They were great, they were troopers.  Why, what's the problem?  That Polish chick had one of the nicest asses I've ever seen.  You like that? 
[02:59:30]  Dude, it was driving me nuts.  Sort of a weird thing because the one girl is like very big, you know, and the other ones are like her minion.  Well, she's like the lead singer of the band.  She's like the leader, not just lead singer of the band.  She seems to be like this leader figure, but it's kind of weird because it's almost like a...  What?  Like a mother figure.  Oh, I didn't mind that.  Kind of a weird vibe there.  I thought it was a cool scene.  It was alright.  She guides them, right, Opie?  She guides them through things, helps them.  It was alright.  That was nice.  It was very good.  Alright. 
[03:00:00]  What the hell does Fred want?  What are you checking, Opie?  No, not him.  Wheelchair Fred.  Hold on a minute.  Fred.  Yeah.  Hi, Terry.  Hi there.  What's going on, buddy?  I'm thinking, what's going on here?  Do you know how to get the young guy, Ben, into the club? 
[03:00:30]  Wow.  I have no idea what he said.  Usually we speak Fred pretty well, but today, I don't know.  I think he said, remove my feeding tube.  Do you think we will be able to get the guy into Bill's Bar?  Oh, okay.  I think I know what's happening here.  Bill's Bar.  Alright.  He's got a guy that's driving him to Bill's Bar for our appearance.  Okay.  But he's only 17. 
[03:01:00]  But he's only 17.  Oh, okay.  Fred likes him young.  So he's only 17, and he needs to know how to get in.  Oh, it's just a ride.  Oh, it's just a ride.  Well, it is Boston, so what did Mark Perenna used to do?  Perhaps he could give you some advice on how to get young boys into bars.  Well, Fred, we're not going to be able to get the kid into the bar.  It's just not going to happen.  It's 21 and over.  We can't make exceptions.  So you've got to figure out another way to get to Bill's Bar. 
[03:01:30]  Okay.  I'll keep my eyes open.  You'll keep your eyes and ears open.  You should have kept your eyes open when you were on that motorcycle.  No, it was your badge, Father.  I was innocent.  Yes, you were.  I was the wrong time.  Wrong but long time, right.  Yeah, you got it.  All right.  Well, we're going to be at Bill's Bar.  Yes, April 11th when we get back from vacation.  He can show up the next day, though.  Yeah, the next day he could drive you to Paradise. 
[03:02:00]  Would you want me to go to Paradise?  Well, we want you to go to both.  Yeah, people want to meet you, Fred.  Okay.  So, no, I have two rides to find.  All right.  Well, we're going to let you go, all right?  All right.  By the way, I just have one to say.  Oh, my God.  Developing stories in the Terry Shivo case.  I just have one to say.  13 people arrested for trying to get her water.  Yeah, people are getting arrested trying to bring her water. 
[03:02:30]  They're arresting, like, 10-year-old kids.  What are they doing?  They're going with water and walking toward the hospital.  They say, I'm going to bring her water, and they get arrested.  You know, it's one of those protest arrest things.  It's a peaceful thing, though.  The cops say, okay, kneel down, and they kneel down.  Are you there?  They pick them back up and escort them into a padded van.  Yeah, cuff them.  I saw a little kid cuffed going into a van.  You know me, sir, don't you not.  He's just hanging. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, pray the van.  Fred, we'll see you in Boston.  I don't think we have the energy to try to get through a wheelchair-front phone call today.  No, not at all.  You're right.  We're one day away from vacation.  We have one more live show tomorrow, and then we're out of here for two weeks.  And then April 11th, we'll be broadcasting live from Bill's Bar in Boston, which is on Lansdowne Street.  We're trying to enjoy our after-sex glow.  I know, I know.  And there's Fred.  I know.  And remember, the showtime for the Bill's Bar show is going to be 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  because it's opening day, Yankees, Red Sox. 
[03:03:30]  It's going to be just a great time.  And then the next day, we're going to be at Paradise doing our morning show, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Eastern.  And all that info should be up on opiananthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  Okay?  And, by the way, can I send out a quick thanks to Sabra Cadabra for sending in the tapes and DVD?  But next time you send in shirts, send XLs.  Nobody wears mediums.  I do.  Nobody wears mediums.  You wear a medium, man?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at us.  I have to wear a loose shirt, though.  I know I'm a mess, but I can't wear a tight shirt.  I don't know what happened to us, but we're a lot thinner than we used to be. 
[03:04:00]  We used to be.  I don't know.  That's those.  Two years of suicidal thoughts, I became anorexic when I got fired.  Anorexic.  I said that, no?  Oh, yeah, he is hit.  He has a great shirt.  He has an XL for my fat body.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, sweet kids.  Hi, Brian.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hey, uh, by the way, I just wanted to tell you, after listening to those girls, you know  how hard it is to drive a semi with a boner?  It's hard to drive a semi with a semi. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, well, no, fuck no.  I can't even get the horn with that one.  Watch this.  Uh, there.  Hey, I know what Carrie Schiebel was saying.  What?  She was saying, I trusted you, you fat fuck.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  They didn't remove her feeding tube.  Don backed over it.  There was a kink in the hose.  What was her husband's name?  Mike D'Andre Onomo?  Anyway.  That's good.  Very good, Brian.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  All right.  Yeah, that worked out with the ladies.  I got to say.  They were nice.  It was heading toward disaster once again. 
[03:05:00]  I don't like having to beg that much, but you reach a point where it's just like, all  right, now we've got to come up with little fun games to get them to take their panties  off?  You know, I understand.  They don't understand what desensitized filth bags we are.  I know.  They're hot girls.  They're topless.  They were very cool.  They played along.  And then we're like, look, we want to see lips.  Yeah, we're panties off.  We're dirt bags.  We want to see ass and lips.  And they did.  They take their shirts off and they think that's good enough.  No.  Which it should be in most cases.  It's not.  This is why we don't have a lot of girls on the show because Steve calls me almost every 
[03:05:30]  other day.  We've got girls who want to get naked.  I'm like, well, that's great, Steve, but what are they going to do?  Right.  We don't want to be in a situation where we're in the studio begging them.  Yeah.  You know, because it really gets boring fast and people don't want to hear that crap.  But they did it.  They all got naked.  No, they were great.  I mean, this was an example of it working out perfectly.  Lesbian couch got used the way it's supposed to get used.  And then Steve gets frustrated and I'm like, Steve, but unless we know what they're doing,  it's just a waste of time because we've spent 20, 30 minutes trying.  Oh, they forgot their pom-poms?  Steve had to come back in and get her. 
[03:06:00]  How hot was that?  Them two naked doing their little cheers.  Yeah.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, you get the point, though.  I mean, whatever.  Let's go to Vermont and say hi to Scott.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Yes.  Listen, I just wanted to tell you, this has been the best frigging week of your show since  you got back on the air.  I've been listening since you were back on N.E.W.  And between D.D. getting spanked and the girls today, man, you guys are rocking.  You're back.  I'm punching out.  Talk to you later.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, we're having a lot of fun. 
[03:06:30]  And the show goes to the next level when we get back from vacation.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day.  Oh, wow.  I didn't see that coming.  Let's go to Jim the trucker.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing, shit, Ted?  How you doing?  All right, pretty good.  Hey, I got a midget sighted for you.  I was rolling down 80 here in PA, and I had to go drop a deuce, so I walked into the rest  areas.  Yeah.  And, you know, you glance onto the stalls. 
[03:07:00]  I didn't see nobody in them, so I went in one, and all of a sudden, I hear somebody farting  up a storm.  So I kind of bend over, look down, and see these two little feet dangling off the fucking  toilet, man.  And I started cracking up.  So when you looked under, you couldn't see the feet because they barely touched the floor.  Yeah.  And these two little feet dangling, man.  They were about, shit, a good six inches a foot off the floor.  I saw a cane there and everything.  I was cracking up.  You know, I had to hurry up and see this guy.  It's the little things in life that probably torture midgets. 
[03:07:30]  It's not being laughed at in the mall.  It's always having to go, no, no, someone's in here.  Because their little feet don't fairly hang down.  It's the rattle of the door.  That's the midget's greatest fear.  Hey, hey!  It's not ridicule or a large dog.  It's an unlocked little bathroom stall door.  Hey, hey, some privacy, please.  I'm in here.  Hey, hey, the guy taking a shit.  Hello?  Oh, sorry.  I didn't see anything.  I didn't see any feet.  Yeah, well, I'm in here, buster. 
[03:08:00]  All mad.  Not so mad at him, at the guy, but, you know, just mad.  Maybe mad at mom and dad's DNA.  Why?  For having that little kink in the one piece of strand.  A little kink in the strand.  Why couldn't my feet be closer to the ground?  Why couldn't my little legs not be so fat and short?  Hey, for Christ's sake, I'm dumping here.  Poor little guy.  Little fella dropping like a little rabbit.  When I got out, it was a little black guy, too, man. 
[03:08:30]  It was funny.  I don't think I've ever seen a black midget.  Aw, no street cred.  If you're a black midget.  Except that one guy that used to be in, what the hell was he, in the Ghetto Boys?  Guys, I can barely hear you.  I'm punching out.  Later.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Yeah, he was a badass.  Oh, wow.  Had an eye shot out once.  He had like one eye.  What the hell was his name?  Anyone remember?  No.  God, I can't remember his name.  A little midget.  They used to put him in trees all the time in their videos.  He'd be hanging out of the tree. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, of course.  Anthony, do we have any sad music?  Uh-oh.  Well, all I have is, well, you know it.  It's usually reserved for a...  This was brought to our attention from one of our listeners.  The listeners give us the best show prep on a daily basis.  Yeah.  I read the USA Today every day, and I missed this one in the life section.  Oh.  The headline says, Murphy the dog, a gift who kept on giving.  Aw.  Oh, B. 
[03:09:30]  Don, run him over.  The final word by Craig Wilson.  Aw.  Our dog Murphy died last week on her bed in the corner of the dining room just before noon  on a cool but sunny late winter's day.  Aw.  The kind of day she loved most.  Of course.  Little fella.  She was 14, plus a few months.  And when it came time for him to move on, I cradled him in my arms.  That little poem that Ann Landers had that's up on everybody's refrigerator that owns a pet. 
[03:10:00]  We laughed and enjoyed our lives.  And when the time came, when he was too old, I took him to the vet and held him as he took  his last breath knowing that I loved...  Shut up.  I want to think of the poem that Don wrote.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  I killed my dog.  How about you?  This is going to be a nice little story about a dog dying after a long, happy life. 
[03:10:30]  How am I supposed to come out of an up-tempo number?  I know.  We had a lot of dogs growing up, Anthony.  You were one of those dog families, always had to have a dog?  I just wished that just one of our dogs would have died like this little dog.  Special.  But in our family, our dogs all died tragically.  Was it horrific?  Tragically.  Dramatic for the children?  As in mom screaming.  Bushwick Bill.  Thank you, fellas. 
[03:11:00]  For example, mom screaming.  Who left the front door open?  Oh, boy.  And next to you here is a car trying to stop and dime.  That's pretty much how our dogs went.  Over and over and over again.  Yeah.  My God, man.  Why would you have an animal that if you leave the door open and they get out, they're going to die?  Like, I can't stand that.  You go up to someone's house and they go,  Did you let the cat out? 
[03:11:30]  Did you?  What?  Teach him not to run out the door, then.  What are you doing to the poor little fellow that he wants to run out the door every time you open it?  You're so right.  I hate that.  You're so right.  You should be able to open the door and the cat goes,  I know not to go out there.  I'm going to get killed.  They don't know any better.  They're curiosity.  That's what kills the cat.  Very good.  But the family's always on guard,  wondering if that dog got out from the time you opened the door to come in.  Then it's your fault.  I like the music, but I think we're going to go with  I Will Remember You by Sarah McLachlan. 
[03:12:00]  Sarah McLachlan.  Sarah McLachlan.  Murphy, the dog, a gift who kept on giving, Anthony.  The Murph.  I'm sure they called him Murph.  If you will.  Hey, Murph.  The final word by Craig Wilson.  Murph.  Hey, Murph.  Our dog Murphy died last week.  On her bed in the corner of the dining room just before noon on a cool but sunny late winter's day.  The kind of day she loved most.  Yeah.  She was 14, plus a few months.  A good long life. 
[03:12:30]  We knew the end was near, but we weren't ready.  No one ever is.  How could you be?  Yeah.  As she lay dying, I wrapped her in an old afghan,  sat down on the floor next to her and waited.  Yeah, that's a little loud.  And when her labored breathing finally came to an end and her cloudy eyes stared off in the distance, I had a good cry.  Just Murphy and me.  Dead Murphy and him.  Dog people will understand.  Those who say, it was just a dog, get over it, will not. 
[03:13:00]  But I'm not writing to those people today.  I'm writing to those who know what joy a dog can bring.  And Murphy brought us great joy.  I don't think there was a day she didn't make me laugh.  When has a dog ever made anyone laugh?  Will you calm down over there?  This is my moment.  Sorry.  Thank you.  My partner, Jack.  There it is. 
[03:13:30]  All righty.  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to start your engine.  Here we go.  I think Jack had an afghan on him at one point.  I love the people driving in their cars going, where the fuck is this going, Opie?  My little fruit monkey.  Just have confidence in your old pals from time to time.  Murph, what are you doing?  My partner, Jack, always said she was an angel sent to us from above. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not sure angel is the right word, and our neighbors would surely agree with that.  But I understand.  She was a gift, as all dogs are.  In hindsight, lighting the match was a bad idea.  And Murph would always let me know when Jack was unfaithful,  because she would sniff his crotch and run away barking.  Me, Jack, Murph, we'll all get together.  Some coke, I'll lick his ass.  All right, look, if you want Jack to touch your little dog pussy, just bark when someone knocks. 
[03:14:30]  If this is good with you, I'll come over.  Just walk around the house in a dirty robe, looking emaciated.  Yeah, come on, we'll get Betsy and Afghan, we'll wrap up Murph.  Eat a little dog pussy.  Suck my little lipstick cock. 
[03:15:00]  Me, you, the Red Rocket.  All of us.  Get some hookers, some dog biscuits.  You are so fucking gay.  Can I go to Casey Kasem, please?  Of course.  Casey?  God damn it, if I got to come out of another lesbian couch scene and go into a dog death pit,  then, who's setting this up? 
[03:15:30]  Well, you do make a good point.  There's a lesbian thing going, and I got to do a goddamn dog death pit?  I'm telling you, I can't take this anymore.  Is that fruit monkey on the phone, and where are those goddamn pictures I was supposed to see?  All right, where was I?  Come on now, let's get back to this, all right?  You were at the part where his partner, Jack, came home with a big black eye.  A bunch of skinheads chanting outside the door.  Oh, yeah, okay, she was a gift, as all dogs are.  Right, sure.  Derek, find another song, because Sarah's fading out soon. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Yes, she was just a dog, but she was our dog, and we loved her.  Quirks and all.  Oh, and she'd fetch our paper and cocktails.  Murphy was a soft-coated Wheaton Terrier, a feisty lot, and she more than lived up to  her Irish clan's reputation.  She had her definite likes and dislikes, from the mailman, pure evil, to fashion.  Keep it simple.  Oh! 
[03:16:30]  Fashion?  She never tolerated poorly-dressed people.  Neither did they gaze.  She could spot them a block away.  A sinister-looking hat, a too-long coat, furry boots.  All of that sent her into a barking frenzy, exposing fashion victims for what they were.  Sure.  Sure the dog saw all that.  This guy's a really funny writer.  He's a really funny writer.  Gee.  This guy's terrific.  A lot of big laughs in this article.  Yeah.  To me, the only laugh so far is Murphy on a cool day, finally getting away from this 
[03:17:00]  pesty faggot.  Alright, please.  It's my moment.  Thank you.  Let it rock.  Hundreds of times I crossed the street, never knowing what to say.  Sorry, my dog doesn't like your outfit.  Never seemed quite right.  You know what the dog didn't like?  He didn't recognize when he smelled pussy on a dick.  He would bark because it was foreign.  There's supposed to be shit on that.  Oh, oh!  Oh, my God.  For years, we spent each morning in the woods of D.C.'s Rock Creek Park, exploring. 
[03:17:30]  And that included the creek.  Nothing?  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, I didn't get it.  O&A Party, Rock Creek Park.  What?  Murphy took to water like her ancestors took to Guinness.  Murphy took to water like I take to cock.  That's a good one.  She'd wait out until she was just covered, then wag her tiny tail so furiously that a 
[03:18:00]  fountain of spray would appear at a rear.  What?  It doesn't say that.  I swear to God it says that.  Now, that Murphy was pretty unique, actually, wagging his tail and spraying water around.  Wag?  Can you turn the music up just a little bit, please?  Yeah, really.  Holy shit.  It's like I'm up for the whole concert trying to get lines out.  Oh.  Eric enjoys the song more than the bed, I guess.  Oh, that's funny.  Jesus.  Yeah, well, she wagged her tiny tail so furiously that a fountain of spray would appear at her 
[03:18:30]  rear.  Oh.  An act of people came from far and wide to sea.  And back home.  Used to something wagging and then spraying into his rear.  Kind of like what Jack would do with my face in a pillow.  And back home, tired at the end of the day, she claimed my seat the moment I stood up.  I thought I was Jack's job claiming his seat the second he stood up, planting his flag. 
[03:19:00]  This is mine.  I then moved on to another perch.  Oh.  Jack's cock.  It just seemed the natural thing to do.  But in the end is right.  I hope you have the time of your life.  We have to get the really sad music now.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, no.  Stop.  Is it going to go there?  We've got to get the really sad music. 
[03:19:30]  Can you get the 100 decibel sad music, anybody?  Maybe She's Gone by...  It's a Black Sabbath song from Technic Lexus.  She's Gone by Hall & Oates, maybe.  Those faggots stole that, too?  Maybe some She's Gone.  Let's give this a try, guys.  All right.  Okay.  This is going to be tough for me.  All right.  Her dying in the dining room seemed right.  She spent so much time there sitting by my chair, 
[03:20:00]  waiting for whatever would drop her way.  Yeah.  She preferred white meat and warm buttered rolls,  but she wasn't choosy.  She accepted all gifts from above.  But in the end, she would give the ultimate gift.  Dying at home on her terms.  No vet, no needle, no final trip in the car with her in my arms.  Just like numerous friends of mine. 
[03:20:30]  No newspaper article saying pneumonia  and avoiding other disease references.  37 with not a girlfriend to be found in the obituary.  He left behind a lot of friends and some stamps.  No final trip in the car with her in my arms. 
[03:21:00]  Okay.  Where Murphy once raced through the woods and into the creek,  our new pup, Maggie, will follow come summer.  Faggy Maggie.  With any luck, there will be another 14 years of sunrise strolls,  dropped rolls, lost seats.  Not for you.  And over time, Maggie will grow to know us as well as Murphy once did  and love us just the same, quirks and all, 
[03:21:30]  because that's what dogs do.  Maggie's going to get to write a column.  Jack died today on the floor.  And now Maggie will have to explain to her dog friends  why there's two men walking around  instead of a guy and a girl like every one of them.  Has to write a dog book.  We named our dog T-Cell,  so we'd have another one around the house. 
[03:22:00]  That was in the USA Today yesterday, yeah.  Of course.  Murphy the dog, a gift you kept on giving.  That's a touching story.  You go, Murphy.  You go.  You go, girl.  Touching.  Can I tell you, the only time a dog has ever made me laugh  is those two giant mastiffs in California  that just mauled and murdered that 4'11 woman.  That's the only time a dog ever made me chuckle. 
[03:22:30]  I laughed at the dog scene in Boys from Brazil.  That was funny at the end,  when the Doberman Pinches came out and ate them.  That was a funny scene.  I laughed at the dog in the omen  when he knocked that lady off the stool  and she fell backwards and killed herself off the balcony.  That dog made me laugh.  A few laughs in Cujo.  I had a good laugh at old Davey Berkowitz's dog  telling him to kill couples in Cockblock all over New York in 1977.  That was a good one, too.  Yeah, you're right.  Dogs are funny.  Well, people yell or eat some lead. 
[03:23:00]  That was a good one, too.  A couple of chuckles.  I had a good laugh at a dog in a 1978 German porn film  watching a girl in sunglasses blow it to psychedelic music.  That dog made me laugh when he confused, grabbed her,  and filled her mouth full of Coke money.  Digging those little thumb claws into her hips.  Leaving scratches on her back.  They have to put a little mitts on his front paw so he doesn't hurt her. 
[03:23:30]  A little oven mitts on the old fella.  And now that's funny.  A dog in oven mitts.  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Screwing a dame.  Holding on to a drug addict.  Yeah, dogs have made me laugh.  Yeah, good point.  People are requesting Casey Kasem.  Did he cry in the shower?  Cursing God?  Why, God, why, why do I like sucking cock?  Yeah, that little dog made me laugh.  Don's dog made me laugh.  Yeah.  When it scampered under the SUV for warmth 
[03:24:00]  and fat pig's selfish fool slammed it in reverse.  Either there's a speed bump in the driveway  or Frieda's not going to be happy.  Put it in R that day, but that R was for Rudy.  Oh, that was the dog's name.  Lil Rudy.  Lil Rudy.  Ert!  The Tanner Boyle of dogs, all sassy and barking.  Hey, Yankees!  He might be little, but he's got guts.  And now they're all over the driveway. 
[03:24:30]  Right in the middle of those Cooper radials.  Doing his impression of an open can of tomato soup.  Wonderful.  Look at our dog.  Now looks like a meatball hoagie.  Oh.  Yeah.  That was touching, Opie.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  I'm sure that'll end up on refrigerators all over the village. 
[03:25:00]  Chelsea.  Well, Anthony, I also had a dog.  Opie.  Yes, you did.  His name was Fresca.  We rarely play this very uncomfortable.  How about a Fresca?  This very uncomfortable track from our Dementor World CD.  You really had a dog named Fresca?  That also died.  Oh, Opie.  I'm sorry.  Wasn't as, I don't know, cute a story as this one.  Ah, it's a little, it's a little different.  You know what other dog made me laugh?  One that knocked my friend's prime rib dinner all over the floor?  He fucking goose-stepped into its side. 
[03:25:30]  All right.  Little Chester.  He died today on the floor.  I noticed a footprint right by his liver.  He made me laugh and laugh.  He went downstairs once, and I heard him eating something.  Then I heard him cry in pain.  He never got better.  All right.  Jesus.  Chester died that day.  All I saw was something that looked like it said Adidas. 
[03:26:00]  Adidas.  I didn't wear Adidas.  You didn't?  All right.  What?  Oh.  Well, Anthony, here's a little story about my dog.  Yeah.  Oh.  My dog, Fresca.  No.  I haven't heard this in years.  I don't even know.  Oh, B.  I don't even know if it sounds good.  Is this sad?  I don't know how high my voice is going to sound in this.  Oh, right now.  I don't know.  You sound like Didi.  Dude, I got a very similar story.  We had a collie growing up, Fresca.  It was the collie, you know, that we had when we were all like, you know, five, six years  old, okay?  Like the little lapty. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Fifteen years go by.  Now the dog's really old, okay?  Yeah.  We notice it has a bump on its rear.  A little cyst, okay?  We take it to the vet, and the doctor decides we better remove the cyst from the 17-year-old  dog.  We're going to put him under.  He'll be here an hour, and you'll have Fresca back home.  He'll be patched up.  Give him a little treat.  Everything will be fine, okay?  This vet, same thing with anesthesia.  Next thing you know, we get a call, anxiously awaiting to bring Fresca home from our lovely 
[03:27:00]  vet.  This can't be good.  Phone rings, and we're all excited, like, hey, we got his dog treats, the water, everything  is cool.  Vet goes, uh, uh, we have some bad news.  Fresca died.  He died.  He killed my damn dog.  Because of the cyst?  Because of a cyst.  If we left it alone, the dog would have lived another two or three years.  It wasn't bothering him.  But the vet insisted he had to take the cyst off Fresca.  Unbelievable. 
[03:27:30]  So now we have to pick up dead Fresca.  Thank you.  Because we're not going to pay the money for him to take care of the dog.  Oh, yeah.  So my dad carries it and puts it in our little, uh, lovely station wagon with the panel siding,  you know.  And now we have to deal with dead Fresca.  So my dad goes and takes his little ride.  Two hours later, he comes home with, uh, no Fresca.  He probably dropped it off in the woods somewhere.  There's our lovely dog in the woods somewhere after living 17 damn years.  You should have left him alone. 
[03:28:00]  Should have left him alone.  And same thing, a bill comes in the mail.  We've got to now pay, uh, the vet for killing Fresca.  What the hell is going on?  Little Fresca.  Little freaking Fresca.  The Countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at one, right here on the radio station you  grew up with.  Music Radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell is going on here?  Geez, well, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished. 
[03:28:30]  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous.  Fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning and every Saturday morning at 2, 2.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether  we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
[03:29:00]  And here's what he writes.  Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll need  a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles.  But he was most certainly a part of...  Let's go start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those 
[03:29:30]  transitions.  And then you got to go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for.  But goddammit, if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a fucking  up-tempo record every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week.  Since the last goddamn time, I want somebody to use his fucking brain to not come out of 
[03:30:00]  a goddamn record that's up-tempo and I got to talk about a fucking dog dying.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day.  I don't know if you want to go down that road again, Anthony, but this story sounds  very, very familiar.  Oh, really?  Does it ring a bell somehow?  It did involve $3 million, right?  I believe it involved about $40 million.  Relatively speaking, it was $3 million to me.  Believe me.  It was $40 million to me.  It was $40 million to me, my friend. 
[03:30:30]  $40,000 to me.  I had no idea you could do this in a divorce case when you're first getting separated and  stuff, but this was every penny I had earned.  In my life.  $40 large.  Ann had $40 large in a joint account with his ex, okay?  And the shit was hitting the fan.  Oh, yeah.  And we're trying to do a radio show, and it was just getting ugly.  We both, I was way in this in the beginning with Anthony, and it was just getting awfully 
[03:31:00]  hot.  Oh, yeah.  And-  I found out she had hired Dominic Farber as the lawyer, and I'm like, oh, this means  trouble.  This means trouble.  So I tell Hope, I go, what am I going to do?  Well, I suggested it to you.  Go what?  Going down to the bank?  Yeah, because I go casually.  I go, Ant, maybe you should take some of that money out, because that was it.  That's all Anthony had.  Yeah.  If he didn't get his mitts on some of that money, he was fucked.  And it turned out he was fucked for a while.  Yeah, broke.  So-  Broke.  So I go, Ant, I go, Ant, you know, why don't we go down to the bank and you take some of 
[03:31:30]  that money out?  Hey, that's a good idea, O.  And I swear to you, Ant goes, because he's a good guy.  Ant is truly a good guy.  Yeah.  He won't say it himself, but I'll say it for him.  Oh, thank you.  I'll agree.  So-  I'll say it myself.  I'm a good guy.  And he's a fair guy, too.  So he was thinking in his head, all right, I got 40G in this joint account.  It's going to get ugly.  We're probably going to end up getting divorced.  Yeah.  Yeah, at that point, it was pretty obvious.  I'm going to take half.  I go, I'm going down to the bank and taking 20 grand out of the bank.  Even though he probably deserved all of it, because the ex wasn't working. 
[03:32:00]  It was my money.  It was his money that he earned to that point in our radio career.  But, you know, you're married, so whatever, blah, blah, blah.  I'll take half.  We go down there.  It's one of the funniest and saddest moments I've ever experienced in my life.  All at the same time.  I go down to the bank.  We both walk down to the bank.  I get my withdrawal slip, and I fill it out.  $20,000. 
[03:32:30]  I'm looking like, where am I going to put all this cash?  You know, making sure I-  We're talking, you're going to get it in large bills.  Yeah, well, like, I'll get it.  I'll get it in hundreds, and it's big.  This isn't even that long ago.  It and I didn't really have any money yet.  No.  And we were thinking it would be kind of cool to walk around, you know.  It was 1999.  Huh?  1999.  That's it.  It's only six years ago.  Yeah.  Not even, because it was whatever.  So we're thinking, wow, it'd be kind of fun to walk around with $20,000 back to the station.  20 G's.  We're all-  Better look out.  We're all nervous and stuff.  How are you going to carry it, you know?  $20,000. 
[03:33:00]  I walk up.  I got my withdrawal slip.  I, I, hello.  Good, good morning.  I slip her the slip and say, uh, uh, hundreds, please.  Okay.  She starts doing something, and then she gets a puzzled look on her face as she looks into  the computer monitor.  And then she typed forever.  I don't know what the hell they do.  And then she did the squint, crinkle the nose, put the face right near the monitor.  Kind of look.  And I'm looking, I'm looking like, hmm.  I wonder what the problem, maybe the computers are down here at the bank. 
[03:33:30]  I hate when the computers go down at the bank.  Maybe they're using new software, and she's just not used to it yet.  I'd hate to try to take the 20 G's out at the ATM, you know, for 500 at a time.  You were making kind of like silly little jokes.  Why not?  He was acting like he was Howard Hughes.  Why not?  It's just cute.  20 G's.  Well, then, I hear, um, Mr. Kumia, um, there's...  Didn't you have to go talk to the other guy, or no?  Yeah, yeah.  There's a problem... 
[03:34:00]  With your account or something.  ...with your account.  Uh, our manager over here, or some assistant manager or something, I went and spoke to him.  He went over and looked at the monitor and everything.  Uh, he said, um, you, you have a withdrawal here for $20,000.  There's, there's, I believe it was $250 left in the account.  There's $250 in this account.  This twat.  I'm like, wait, wait. 
[03:34:30]  Emptied out the account.  It didn't even hit me at first.  I'm just like, wait, $250, but where's the $40,000 that, where?  Oh, that movie, that, uh, that money was, um, withdrawn, uh, I believe yesterday.  He said.  She took $40,000, removed it from the account.  Everything.  Left $250 in the account for me. 
[03:35:00]  You never saw any of that money.  Did you guys plan on how to walk back to NEW with the $250?  No.  Yeah.  No, because Ann was the good guy.  He only took out $125.  Yeah, I took out $125.  She might have needed half of that too.  Very funny.  What a sap.  I just walked out with sap written across my face.  I'll have it in five.  Yeah.  I'll take that in fives.  You know how sick and twisted I am, and Ann and I are really close.  I laughed so hard.  You have to.  And then I was like, then I was the consoling friend, because it was just, I hope he was  a consoling friend, and then asked me if he could borrow $10 for lunch. 
[03:35:30]  Hey, look, I just, no, no, no, I don't want to go to an ATM.  I just want to go to an ATM.  This is where you're at your bank.  Yeah.  I'm going to grab some lunch, but I just want to get a cab, but I don't want to go to an  ATM.  Oh, my God.  Got a little safety alert for people. 
[03:36:00]  It's tax season, as you know, and this guy had a little problem.  This story is courtesy of our friends over there at bark.com.  No doubt computers and the Internet have made filing your taxes easier.  A lot of people do their taxes online.  But it can also be a big trouble if your tax returns and all the private information they  contain wind up online. 
[03:36:30]  One local man this happened to.  He uses a popular file sharing program to swap music and other things online.  And he also does his taxes on it.  Apparently, he had made a little boo-boo and put his tax return that he did online in the  file sharing folder that he uses when he goes online.  So some guy called him up and started goofing on him and giving him his tax information,  social security number.  And that's when this guy realized, oh, my God, his tax return and all of his personal 
[03:37:00]  financial information were out there on the web.  So a bunch of people here that were doing the report went to this file sharing program,  put tax in the search engine, and came up with hundreds of people's tax returns that  just inadvertently stuck it in the wrong folder on their computer, and now their personal  information is online.  You use file sharing, Jimmy?  I have.  I don't need more because there's too many viruses.  Viruses end up on your computer.  You get Trojans. 
[03:37:30]  Awful, dude.  And all kinds of just spam things.  It's ridiculous when you use any of this file sharing stuff.  But you also don't know what else is going out over the web because you don't know what  folders they got access to.  Well, I always knew.  A lot of people don't.  I always made sure.  You knew?  Yeah, but I was very careful only important.  And to be honest with you, there's some porn out there that I really don't want to see.  I mean, like really vile, inhuman shit.  And it was like sometimes you'd open a file that says hot chick, and it was something  like fucking disgusting.  And you're like, I mean, not even funny disgusting, but like revolting.  And you're like, ah, fuck this shit.  Such thing as not funny disgusting? 
[03:38:00]  Well, yeah, you're right.  Two people actually holding hands.  Yeah.  So I just go to Napsha now for music.  Another danger.  Yeah, you got to pay for Napsha.  I don't care.  You don't have all that crap on there.  Exactly.  Danger.  Beware.  What are you doing?  What's going on?  There's no reason.  Hawk.  Thank you.  Oh, he's screwed up his computer.  Hawk.  Well, we're trying to get ready for what did we learn on the OPNF.  Eric's like a walking computer virus.  He'll just come by and click off of what you were looking at.  What happened?  What happened?  I set up all night so we could get the listeners involved for the last few minutes here. 
[03:38:30]  It's a virus.  And where were you going?  Getting the information from Boston ready for you.  I learned something.  Oh, we don't need to promote that again.  Did you learn, Jimmy?  It's funny.  You should ask that, Ant.  Yeah, I've got to tell you.  This is the last time Jimmy's going to be on the show for about 17 days.  Until vacation.  After vacation.  Anthony and I will be here tomorrow with Bob Kelly sitting in for Jimmy.  Jimmy might call.  I'll definitely call in.  You'll call in?  All right.  Yeah, of course, man.  I've got no press in Florida because of the holidays.  So it's like I'll definitely wake up and call you guys.  Just say hello.  I'll have to check in, man. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  And again, last time I'll be able to mention this for 17 days.  I'm sure these tickets will be gone by the time we return from break.  Oh, absolutely.  My HBO shoot is here in New York City at the Skirball Theater in The Village, right around  the Comedy Cellar, man.  April 26th, Tuesday night, for tickets.  And these were advanced tickets.  And this is done.  I fought really hard to get Opie and Anthony fans the first crack because I want you psychos there.  They're not a bunch of fucking soccer moms that they hand tickets to.  Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com.  That is not my email address. 
[03:39:30]  That is something HBO set up.  Jim Norton at BroadwayVideo.com.  It's on a first contact, first serve basis.  So I hope to see you guys.  And the tickets are free.  They're free tickets, man.  So they're going to send you an invite.  All you have to put is your name and email address and say, I want to go see Jim Norton.  And they will give you information on how to do it.  It's very simple.  But they are free tickets.  Very good.  That's really cool.  Yeah, man.  Get that place out.  You can see Jim Norton tape his HBO thing for free.  That's awesome.  Yes.  I just don't want these tickets given to people who aren't fans.  I don't want to get groaned at there in my special doing a vicious job. 
[03:40:00]  I don't need that shit.  Right.  I want these fans.  You guys are the ones that put me here.  Yeah, and you guys, all kidding aside, you've got to be really cool because this is the  big moment for Jimmy.  And they will.  I mean, yeah, you can't yell out like monster.  I don't mind that at the comedy cell, but it will just get cut because I'm taping two shows.  Yeah, you idiots.  I've seen that.  But they actually, they seem to know when I need it to be mellow, and they are.  They kind of like, you know, they respect that, so I'm all right.  Well, no shit.  I love that one. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  A lot of fun today.  Yes.  Fun, educational, and a little sexy.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Sexy.  Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  I was talking about the Terry Schiavo audio.  Yeah, I know.  Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Maybe you could take the Terry Schiavo audio we played and do a little mix for us.  We're looking for any type of Pat O'Brien sex tape mixes.  Tomorrow's the last day we can play him before we go on vacation.  Mm-hmm.  And that's that.  I guess we could play What Did We Learn on the Opium Anthony program.  No?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:41:00]  Bueller, anyone?  Bueller.  Let's see if Mike of Long Island has one.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hi, sexy.  Hey.  Hey, I learned that if Terry Schiavo was doing those creepy sounds, she'd make for a good  pocket pussy.  Hmm.  Let me think about that a second.  Pinchy.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, butterfly.  Hi, Pinchy.  Hey.  Hey, today I learned that Terry Schiavo is going to be singing Puttin' on the Ritz soon.  And Ant's new impression is... 
[03:41:30]  The grudge.  Rob on Long Island.  Hello?  Hi, Rob.  Go ahead, Rob.  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned that if Robert Plant opened his mouth, I know she should be able to see  a lit candle.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  I learned that.  Early in the program.  Yes.  Steve from .NET.  Hey, boys.  Where are you from, Steve?  What's that?  What website?  Opianthony.net.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it doesn't say that.  It just said .NET.  Opianthony.net.  Cool.  What do you got, Steve?  Today I learned that it's Titty Thursday. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Insert the two fingers.  Yeah.  And Patty's up on blocks in the yard.  Yeah.  Very good.  Listen, good.  Let's go to Tim the Chucker.  Tim, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that Opi sounds like Dee when he talks about a dead dog.  All right.  I knew Dee Dee voice.  I knew that was coming.  Anthony said exactly that.  He goes, I bet you if I refresh feedback, they're talking about how high your voice was  in Boston.  There we go.  Opi, when did you have this dog?  At six?  And when did you record this?  At eight? 
[03:42:30]  Hey, did we ever get a final picture count, Op, between me and you?  No, we never got one, huh?  I didn't want to embarrass you.  Steve from .NET.  That's not true.  You'd love to embarrass me.  No, it's Steve from Jersey.  Today I learned that as a child, Stalker Patty looked like Stein from the Bad News Bears.  Yep.  Oh, wow.  I didn't hear that.  That's a great line.  Oh, very good.  Opi, I said that.  I was busy doing something, I guess.  Rob from Alabama.  Hey, guys.  Today I learned Terry Schiavo can talk to whales.  Yes.  Yes, he can.  Very good. 
[03:43:00]  Thank you, Rob.  And with that, we are spent.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll be here live, I swear.  Eric, will you fucking stop?  And it's here.  Program complete. </pre>
