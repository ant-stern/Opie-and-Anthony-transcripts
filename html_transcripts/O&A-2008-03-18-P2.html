<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a silly game centered around the phrase "break me off a piece of that," generating humorous responses.  This was followed by a conversation with comedian Chris Rock, who infamously introduced his "story of the year" as the "two girls, one cup" video, sparking discussion about its shocking content and viral spread.  The hosts then conducted a lengthy interview with Robert Kelly.  Unexpectedly, Kelly revealed his past experiences in foster care, leading to a candid and often vulgar discussion about his childhood, including arrests for unarmed robbery at age 11, time in juvenile detention, and encounters with abusive foster parents and fellow inmates. The conversation was rife with racial slurs and derogatory language from both Kelly and the hosts.  Despite the difficult subject matter, the discussion often incorporated darkly humorous anecdotes and self-deprecating comments, contrasting Kelly’s troubled past with his current comedic success.

A phone call with Marge from Little Shelter animal shelter then ensued. This conversation quickly devolved into a chaotic and sexually suggestive exchange, with the hosts making inappropriate jokes and probing Marge's personal life. They repeatedly joked about sending Marge Viagra and other illegal substances, implying sexual connotations and speculating about her personal relationships. The conversation included discussions of increasingly absurd and violent hypothetical scenarios involving harming animals for money, which Marge consistently refused.  The segment ended with negotiations for a possible on-air stunt involving the killing of shelter animals in exchange for a live broadcast from the shelter.  Further discussion of the animal shelter, and the possibility of hitting a puppy with a baseball bat or golf club for money, also took place.

The show next featured a discussion of Bill Burr’s recent stand-up performance in Camden, New Jersey, including heavily bleeped audio clips of Burr intensely insulting the audience after being booed.  Callers and the hosts discussed the performance, focusing on Burr’s insults and the audience’s eventual positive reaction. Burr himself then called in, explaining his improvised rant as a response to a hostile audience and detailing his decision to abandon his prepared set. Later, Kelly returned to the show to discuss his experience with Metamucil and his bowel movements, accompanied by graphic descriptions and visual aids.

A subsequent segment began with Opie and Anthony describing graphic and sexually explicit content from a gay porn video before discussing Joe Rogan's accusations against Carlos Mencia of joke theft. Rogan then called in, launching into a lengthy tirade against Mencia, accusing him of joke theft, using a fake name ("Carlos Mencia" instead of "Ned Wholeness"), falsely claiming Mexican heritage, and providing details of alleged joke theft.  Rogan mentioned video evidence and boasted about his marijuana consumption. Audio clips of Mencia defending himself against accusations of plagiarism were played, with Mencia attributing the accusations to jealousy.  The discussion covered joke theft in comedy and the lack of accountability within the community. Rogan also detailed his experiences hosting *Fear Factor*, describing disgusting challenges.  Mencia then joined the show, attempting to defend himself, referencing his *Star Search* appearances and citing his website biography.  The discussion became heated, with insults and accusations from both sides, concluding without a resolution.  Mencia also revealed he hadn't become a US citizen yet due to prioritizing a comedy gig over his swearing-in ceremony.

Another segment focused on the US citizenship test, with in-studio banter about its difficulty, specifically questions on the US flag, history, government branches, and historical figures.  The Rogan-Mencia feud then resurfaced, with Rogan's criticisms being played, and Mencia again defending himself, offering to provide recordings of past sets.  The discussion was heated, with insults and accusations from both sides, and involved listener phone calls.

The final segment featured a caller, Mike from California, praising the show and criticizing Howard Stern.  The hosts then discussed their recent interview with Joe Rogan and Carl's Jr.'s upcoming appearance. Carlos Mencia, who was in studio, performed some stand-up.  Bill Burr, also in studio, provided commentary and the hosts and Burr reacted to *Rock of Love with Bret Michaels*, with multiple clips being played, focusing on contestant Tiffany. The conversation touched on celebrity reality shows and the rise of has-beens in Hollywood, mentioning the *Austin Powers* mini-me.  Andrew Dice Clay then called in to perform a short stand-up routine, followed by Rich Vos promoting his shows and plugging Metamucil.

Fancy feast.  Break me off a piece of that fancy feast.  It's a cat food.  It's the best...  Boo!  ...the best of the worst of the comedians of VOV and Anthony's show.  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  Really awful, too, by the way. 
[00:01:00]  I'll acknowledge that.  Now presenting comedian...  Chris Rock.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the OV and Anthony show.  Hey, Chris, what was your story of the year?  It's the end of the year here.  What's the one story that made you go, this was a good year?  You know my favorite story, and I'm just sad that they didn't stay on it long enough, was the astronaut in the diaper was my favorite of the year.  That one, there's Michael Vick. 
[00:01:30]  Two girls, one cup.  Two girls, one cup is a great one.  What's two girls, one cup?  Oh, Jesus.  We just don't have time, unfortunately.  Wish we had it here.  Wow.  I'm surprised you don't know about it.  It's a video that's just gone completely viral on YouTube, and it's two girls, one cup.  And one girl fills the cup with a lovely thick treat.  Yeah, she could have got it from Baggage Clam in India.  Yeah.  Two girls, one cup, and India. 
[00:02:00]  Just put those all together.  They both share it.  No.  Yes.  It's great.  We're like short timers left in the NAMM when it comes to that.  We're like the short timers in the NAMM.  We've seen it so many times, we just watch and go,  but when we get somebody new and that hasn't seen it, we enjoy them just going,  Oh, I can't look.  Oh, geez.  It is on a human level.  You can't watch it.  It's just, why are they doing this? 
[00:02:30]  Is this a porno?  No.  I think it was supposed to be in some places of the world.  It did nothing to me at all.  But mainstream culture has checked this video out.  It's not just like guys like us.  Two girls, one cup.  It's so big that they don't have, it's hard to find actual video.  You just have, if you type it up, it's just people watching it.  Yeah.  And you're not seeing it.  Yeah, now it's people's reaction to watching it that people are watching.  Two girls, one cup.  I'll try to remember that.  Yeah.  It's easy.  It's a good one.  One cup dot com.  I've just never, you know. 
[00:03:00]  Do you troll around looking at videos?  I troll around and I never press, you know, S-H-I-T.  Yeah.  I've never been that.  I've never been that.  Oh, Chris, for the viewing pleasure.  Just before we go off the air.  If you want to take a quick look.  It starts off with a nice scene, girl-on-girl action, and then you get...  Oh, no!  No!  No! 
[00:03:30]  No!  No!  Oh, they do they ever step it up.  Oh, look at that.  Come on, Chris.  They step it up.  They step it up.  Come on.  Don't be a rookie.  Come on.  Look at that.  They really step it up.  God, they step it up. 
[00:04:00]  That's our favorite part.  Come on, look.  There you go.  There it is.  We just want to make sure you don't forget your time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Two girls, one cup.  Why, indeed.  Why?  You're not going to forget us, right, Chris?  Why?  That was wonderful.  Where do you get those girls?  That makes me breathe better when I see that video.  I think I found a new opening act. 
[00:04:30]  It's an icebreaker, all right?  Hey, what's up?  This is Chris Rock, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program.  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony, and this is the worst of Robert Kelly on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:00]  Let me guess.  We make a lot of fat jokes.  Yes.  Hey, this is the liverwurst of Robert Kelly.  How about we start out with that one?  Right.  Who eats that anyway?  Robert Kelly.  He looks like liverwurst.  And I bet you we say, dad!  Hey, E-Rock, this is a great idea.  Jesus.  Having us improv before all these bits.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, we got to move on to something else because they're reminding us to ask you about the foster thing. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, shit.  Robert Kelly just kind of, out of nowhere, we've known the guy for years.  He's a foster child.  Wait, Patrice, you don't know this either?  You know I was in foster homes.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was adopting a foster child or something.  Okay, yeah, I know Bob that problem.  You thought I was adopting a kid?  Bobby's really one of the true white boys I know that has, like, he's, like, has problems.  See, there's a thing about, it's really a philosophy I have about him and, like, certain white guys.  Yeah.  Okay?  Certain white guys.  Because, you know, if you're white in this world and you're not successful, it's really suffering. 
[00:06:00]  It's a lot of suffering involved with not being a successful white guy.  Yeah, it's expected.  When you're expected.  We're still talking about me, right?  Yeah, you.  So, there's some white boys who are really David Banner trying to be the Hulk, and there's some white boys who are the Hulk trying to be David Banner.  Right.  And Bobby is the Hulk.  He's always angry and he's always destructive and he's always evil, but he tries to walk around with this phony, accepting smile of society. 
[00:06:30]  He doesn't realize people react to him like a nigga or a Puerto Rican.  They don't, they don't, he's uncomfortable.  Look at him.  Look at him fidgeting.  And that background noise is him tapping the thing because Bobby tries to be this patient, he's an evil dude.  My eyes are turning green right now.  He's just like that.  Don't make Bobby angry.  Like he's Sonic's jersey.  It's the color of the Sonic's jersey.  He can't fit it no more, but after the show, he's going to come and go, dude, what was that?  I'm not, dude.  He's going to drill into the hole.  You said this to me a hundred times. 
[00:07:00]  Until he accepts that he's not a true white guy, he's not accepted in the white community, he needs to stop.  Look at Bobby.  He's chubby, bald.  He used to be sexy.  Like he used to be the sexy kid, but now he's Professor Turitanaka and he refuses to accept it.  So stop trying to be a white boy, King Kong Bundy.  So what's up with this Foster thing?  We were talking about extreme home makeover shows and stuff and how that's really bad for the family 
[00:07:30]  because after the crews leave, these beautiful houses are now in the middle of the ghetto  and we're thinking, you know, the neighborhood swallows up these homes from the poor people.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He called me a fucking nigga.  I've been telling you that for years, though, Bobby.  It's not new.  So we're talking about this Foster family or something, and out of nowhere he blurts out that he was a Foster kid.  But everybody knows that, though.  I didn't know that.  He certainly didn't want to let us know that.  I just, after you go out of Juvie Hall, you go, they put you in foster homes. 
[00:08:00]  And, uh, and, uh, they're just, the Foster parents are awesome.  Really, they're fucking, they don't do it, most of them do it for the money.  They do it to get extra cash.  Yeah, they do.  They get something for the company, right?  I had mac and cheese every day or peanut butter and jelly.  It wasn't like I got dinner.  That's what I had.  They did it for the extra cash because they have other kids, but they don't want to work.  What about the, uh, card?  They have all these weird rules.  Did you hear that institutionalized, uh, speech right there? 
[00:08:30]  That poor guy.  I love Bobby, man.  That was just pain.  What about the love?  Yeah, was there any love going on?  Where was the love?  No.  No.  This guy would make me go out, he, I would have to wake up in the morning and he would,  he would, he was a security guard, just a fat, bald, redhead dude.  He'd make me go out of the house in the morning, uh, in the winter and just walk around because  he liked to be home.  He liked to walk around in his underwear.  Well, good.  So I'd walk around Lawrence, Mass, which is a dangerous neighborhood, you know, and I'd 
[00:09:00]  have to just walk around.  No.  Lawrence is dangerous.  I just want to make Anthony know that this story is horseshit, but it's not horseshit.  I didn't want to let the fans know that Lawrence is not tough.  I'm from your part of the country.  You're from Roxbury, the worst part of Boston, but there are, there's a middle ground between,  well, you know, between Roxbury and Newton.  They had a riot in fucking, in, uh, Lawrence.  Yeah.  It was some type of immigrant.  It was, it was about Guatemalans. 
[00:09:30]  It's a, they have a, they have a Guatemalan town or whatever.  Puerto Ricans.  Puerto Ricans, Puerto Ricans.  It's not Guatemalans.  Puerto Ricans, you fucking know.  El Salvadorians, I think they got up there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brazilians.  They're conquistadors.  Bobby is, Bobby is the meanest white boy ever, man, because of that foster home thing.  He's really, he has a lot of deep things going on, man.  How long were you in foster care, though?  Like, what age?  Uh, from, uh, 12, uh.  People need this info for the Photoshop they're going to do with you.  11 to 15. 
[00:10:00]  11 to 15.  And what happened before 11?  What?  What happened before you were 11?  I had a family.  I told you, do you listen?  Wait, you had a family, they gave up on you at 11?  I live with my parents, went to jail.  When you get, you can't just go home after juvie jail.  What do you do at 11?  What did I do?  Oliver Twist.  You know what?  Do you know what?  Listen, fellas.  Opie really is a white guy.  He does a lot of, uh, things that when, when somebody, a criminal asks you what, what, what?  When he repeats your question, he does not want to share that. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, what I, who'd I kill?  Uh.  Patrice, but then that's my job to keep pushing.  If he wants to come back tomorrow, he'll tell us what he did.  What do you mean, why'd I rape her?  What, what, rape her?  Why'd you rape her?  Why'd I rape her?  Oh.  No.  Opie.  What did you rape?  But I'll get to the bombers.  You watch.  All right.  All right.  What'd you do at 11?  What'd I do at 11?  I just said.  What'd I do?  Yeah.  What do you mean, what'd I do? 
[00:11:00]  Wait, you went to jail at 11?  All right, Bob, what did they accuse you of doing?  Oh, that must have been.  They accused me of unarmed robbery, assaulting, battering, militia structure, trespassing, and  breaking.  Wait, wait.  At 11?  Yeah.  You're kidding.  Yeah, but it wasn't all that, dude.  I wasn't a, I wasn't a criminal.  I wasn't a bad kid.  Armed robbery, what was it?  Unarmed.  Oh, unarmed.  That's strong armed robbery.  That's worse than armed robbery.  Yeah.  I understand that.  You don't even need a weapon.  Unarmed robbery.  That's called strong armed robbery without a gun.  I'm just letting the pants know.  What are you doing, dude? 
[00:11:30]  Who did you know?  I'm just letting people know that that's worse.  You called me a fat chink.  You called me a nigger.  And now I'm strong armed robbery.  You can't just let me have some fucking slack.  Who did you muscle?  Who did you muscle at 11?  It was at, you know, what we did.  Wait, you had a little gang at 11?  Well, I hung out with kids.  You know, hang out in a park or something with a bunch of the same kids.  Not strong arming people.  We went into a pizza store and he went in the back.  It was a kid.  One of the cooks was actually a kid he beat up a week before.  So we went back in the kitchen. 
[00:12:00]  He says, listen.  At 11?  He said.  That's what I can't get past.  He goes, we're going to go out there, take the money.  You say it was three black guys who did it.  No offense.  But...  Hey, I'm going to take it.  Yeah, sure.  Whatever.  You're going to say that.  Mandatory.  Yeah, it's a mandatory thing.  It's a mandatory.  It just comes out.  It's in the manual.  Especially if you live in Boston.  Yeah.  Blame all crimes on black guys.  What was that?  Charles Stewart.  Charles Stewart.  I was there. 
[00:12:30]  I was there.  They frisked the entire state of Massachusetts.  Where was you yesterday, nigga?  I was on the moon.  No, you wasn't.  You killed a white woman.  I was playing for the Celtics.  No, you wasn't, motherfucker.  No, you wasn't.  Just for the rest of the country.  Rest of the country.  What's the story again?  She was pregnant.  He was a white boy pregnant.  His wife was pregnant.  He shot her in the head.  Right.  And then shot himself like in his lap or something.  Yeah.  And then said a nigga did it from Roxbury.  And they raped the entire...  Community.  They showed it on TV. 
[00:13:00]  Just black dudes against a brick wall.  Oh, for Boston, that was like...  And that's when liberal white guys started  because his brother got guilty.  Yeah.  He snitched on him.  And he jumped off a bridge.  Jumped off the...  And the same day he jumped off a bridge,  my friend in high school jumped off a bridge.  But that didn't make the papers.  Oh, boy.  White guys always try to cop each other.  So anyway...  He took a cab to the same bridge,  and he said...  Right as he's pulling up to the toe,  the guy just heard...  And the door didn't shut.  Fump, fump, fump.  See what Bobby deals with? 
[00:13:30]  Bobby's a...  He's a bad dude, man.  He got rage in his eyes, man.  There's too much shit in your life to not do.  I try to calm him down.  I try to keep him from dying, man.  So...  He called me doll eyes.  He got doll, he does.  Like a...  Like a doll's eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  My eyelids make a click sound when they blink.  Who has black eyes?  Bobby has black eyes.  You tip him over backwards.  Yeah, close.  With no pupils.  Bobby can see in complete darkness.  Walk us through this 11.  Walk us through the thing. 
[00:14:00]  What happened with the crime?  Pizza joint.  You're going to beat up the cook?  Take the money?  We're going to take the money.  And what happened was the two guys let us do it.  We were both drunk, but my friend went up to the register.  Drunk at 11.  He didn't know how to do the buttons.  Yeah.  So I went up, grabbed, pushed the button, grabbed the money.  As we were running out, I tripped on the curb, landed on my pinky finger, brought it  all the way over to my thumb.  I broke my pinky, man.  Lay in there.  You should have seen me, dude.  I was fucking like, eh.  I thought my pinky was over here. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah?  Okay.  And it didn't hurt.  It just looked fucked up.  You know what I mean?  It didn't hurt yet.  But the place that we actually robbed was owned by the mafia.  They have a restaurant that people don't go to downstairs.  Uh-huh.  You really don't.  There's a pizza place upstairs, but there's a little stairwell.  You go down.  It's like maybe 10 seats, maybe 10 tables.  And I was actually in my friend Frankie's house watching TV, just hanging out, smoking  dope, eating some Tyson chicken. 
[00:15:00]  The door was open.  No offense.  The cops just come up, just came upstairs.  The door was open, came up, grabbed you, Frankie, grabbed him.  It was like a Twilight Zone episode.  Grabbed him, just took him out, took him away.  And I'm sitting in his house.  His mother comes out.  Where's my son?  I was like, the cops just came, took him.  And she was like, what the fuck?  And I was like, I don't know.  I was fucking stoned.  I'm down the park later that night. 
[00:15:30]  The guy pulls up to me, the cop.  He goes, what's your name?  I was like, Robert Kelly.  He goes, there's a warrant for you.  I don't know where.  I guess the warrant got lost.  I think my mother knew one of the cops, and he kind of hid the fucking thing.  But this other dick was like, I'm going back to find it.  He goes, and if you're lucky, I'll pick you up, because you're an idiot, because the people  that, the pizza store you own, they're looking for you, too.  Because they wanted to break my fucking legs.  Ah, yeah.  This is called a Lawrence tale.  Oh, is it?  Chaz Primentary came over.  A Lawrence tale.  Would you rather be feared or loved, Patricia? 
[00:16:00]  And it's absolutely true.  Bobby tells me all these goofy stories, but I can't believe you share them on the radio,  because he makes me swear to God not to tell anybody all the time.  And I don't.  And now you're telling everybody.  Why do I have to keep my big mouth shut?  You're not just at 11.  Bobby was a strong-armed robber.  I told you I would get it out of him.  Yeah, but you make it sound a lot.  Unarmed robbery sounds nicer.  No, no, no, no.  Robbery is, listen, let me tell you something. 
[00:16:30]  I know, I know.  I don't like the word strong-armed.  I've heard about different charges.  Right.  What?  Robbery is as bad as you can get.  Robbery is you taking something from a person.  Arm robbery is bad, but strong-arm robbery is almost worse.  It's worse.  Yeah.  Like mayhem is worse than, like, third degree, like, second-degree murder.  Mayhem.  Mayhem.  Mayhem.  The chick, actually, the chick in the pizza store.  Worse than murder.  Mayhem is when you purposely don't try to kill somebody. 
[00:17:00]  You purposely try to maim somebody.  Yeah.  You try to remove a limb or do something bad so that they don't look the same way anymore.  That's worse than certain degrees of murder.  Of murder.  Yeah.  Wow.  So walk us through it.  So now what?  You're arrested?  So I went back.  Look at all.  No, they didn't get me.  That's a good story, though.  Couldn't get me.  He says, I'm going to be, you want to not go to jail tonight, get off the streets.  I'm an idiot.  I went out.  Me and my friend got a pint of Irish peppermint schnapps or whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:17:30]  And I went down to get some weed.  I was tanked.  All of a sudden, this cop car pulls up.  My mother's in the back seat.  It's like in slow-mo.  She's like, come here, motherfucker.  And I just, I don't know what happened.  I just walked into the car.  Because your mother calls you.  There's that little thing.  There's something in your head that just goes.  And I got in.  I went to jail that night.  And that was it.  The next day, my mother, my bail was $10.  The judge was my first thing.  $10.  They reduced it from $10,000 to $10. 
[00:18:00]  And she wouldn't fucking pay it.  Isn't it 10% cash?  So for like a buck, you get out?  She wouldn't pay $10.  She wouldn't pay nothing.  Nope.  So you sat in jail.  I went to fucking juvie jail.  It was terrifying.  $10, but they wouldn't let you out on your own reconnaissance?  Huh?  Yeah, right?  Juvenile.  Nope.  If my mother didn't want to take me.  She said to the judge.  She goes, if you give him to me, you'll be picking him up in a body bag.  Jeez.  She was like ruthless. 
[00:18:30]  And you got to understand, Bobby's mother was still in high school at the time.  What the hell are you doing?  I'm sorry.  I'm joking.  She's inadvertently called my mother a whore.  Sorry, Bobby.  What's wrong with you?  How long did you have to do?  I'm joking, Bobby.  That was good, though.  I liked that.  It was funny.  I know, but I got to go against it.  I can't really just laugh at my mother being a whore, a black guy.  But your mother was young, right, Bobby?  Or that she was young when she had you.  That's all.  My mother was 15 when she had my sister.  She was 18 when she had me.  She really was drunk in a bush with a schlitz. 
[00:19:00]  Nice.  So you did juvie for how long?  I think it was like three and a half.  You go in for four months.  I think it was four or five months in juvie.  But you go from-  And why was it scary?  Like, walk us through this.  I don't know.  All right.  When you go, you go way out.  They have this place way out in the woods in Middleton.  Okay?  It's an old, abandoned, insane asylum.  I know about this place, too.  Okay.  You know about it.  Yeah.  It's real.  Middle of nowhere.  You walk in.  There's a bunch of other-  And you're 11, right?  Yeah.  That's what I can't get past, by the way. 
[00:19:30]  But go ahead.  You walk in, handcuffs from the court.  And they have the real prisoners in the back.  They have a little bench in the front of the van with a screen.  And they're talking to you the whole time.  You little bitch.  I'd fuck you right in the ass.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I'd get you.  Look at your lips.  Mmm.  You got little sweet lips.  They're both the same size.  I like that, you know.  They're talking to you the whole way.  Oh, boy.  So you get up there.  And then they take you out.  You're in shackles.  They take you in.  You have to shower. 
[00:20:00]  Like, they clean you.  Ooh.  Which is the first time I ever-  Ooh.  I've never been naked with another dude in the room.  And I didn't even have peach phones.  Well, you wasn't even old enough to be a dude yet.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, but I'm next to dudes with fucking schlongs and hair.  You're, like, two years removed from-  Right.  Like, being pedophiled.  Right?  Is that-  What's that?  How old are you gay?  And what's the gay and pedophilia?  When you grow pubes.  Pubes make-  Like, is 11 pedophilia?  Have you-  Oh, yeah.  I would say so.  I think it all is.  Or is he gay? 
[00:20:30]  I think it's all gay and all pedophilia.  All gay pedophilia.  Yeah, what's the fuck, dude?  I don't know if there's a line.  Jesus Christ.  We're talking about technicalities.  Are you insane?  You know so much about the law.  I'm just saying to you.  Dirt balls.  I'm saying it's like, if something had happened to him, would that have been, you know, is he old enough to have been a dude?  Absolutely not.  Have that happen to a dude?  No hair?  Like, where you tell the story, it's like, yo, they got me when I was 11.  It's like, aw, you fag.  Or is it like, aw, jeez, man. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, poor kid.  You was pedophile.  You know what I mean?  Like, what?  It would have been pedophile.  You're not a fag if they pin you down.  They hold you down.  All right, go ahead, Robert.  So they shower you and people are taking a look at you.  So, no, you shower in front of people.  So then you have to go into another room with another creepy dude, you know, who wants to help kids.  Yeah.  But you've been single your whole life.  You live in a one-bedroom and you're 42.  Okay.  Yeah, you just want to help kids. 
[00:21:30]  And then you have to take all your clothes off.  You have to bend over, do five jumping jacks.  You know, and it's like...  Why is that?  So, check for stuff.  Maybe stuff will fall out.  You might be smuggling, you know, like eight grams of heroin in your asshole.  But I'm 11.  I got to know how to tie a knot that tight.  Well, a lot of people did, though.  Smuggling pop rocks up his ass.  Well, what they do is then they put you into this big...  That's a kid thing.  Yo, guys.  Yo, check it out.  You stink.  I got pop rocks. 
[00:22:00]  And then you fucking jumped on that train wreck?  Nice talking to you.  Give me one, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  So then you go into this...  They just stick you in a room with a bunch of other kids.  And you sit there all day.  And you wait till five or six o'clock at night.  And then they go, Robert Kelly.  And you come over.  They handcuff you, shackle you, and then tell you where you're going.  And then they take you in the middle of the night to some lockdown facility.  But you slowly graduate out of shitty, shitty, a little less shitty, to like some place that 
[00:22:30]  you can go out and, you know, have picnics in the afternoon.  And then you go from there to a foster home.  And this had to be in the mid to early 80s.  So this was before rights.  So, you know, guards and stuff.  You know Bobby was abused.  Oh, yeah.  Something happened.  No, I've never...  You know what?  I never...  I was in one place.  It was this place in Halifax, Mass, way out in the middle of the Cranberry Fields.  No, this is Halifax now.  So she went from Middleton to Halifax.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:00]  And further out...  Now, Halifax, if you're not from Massachusetts, is like never heard of it.  But it's...  The further you go out in certain places, the more they do bad things.  Yeah.  This place was bad.  It was one road into the place.  I had a broken nose when I went in there.  And as soon as I got in there, you know, I got my nose broken again.  You know?  And it was...  The whole place was run by this little tiny black dude.  They called him the Godfather.  And all the other...  I don't know why.  They all fucking...  All the other dudes. 
[00:23:30]  But they went at it one day.  Every white kid was getting it.  It was one white kid.  He was bouncing the ball.  They had like a little tiny rim.  Only five...  Everybody could dunk it.  They used to play New York ball.  And this kid was over in the corner just bouncing a ball.  And all of a sudden, you just said,  Yo!  Homeboy!  And the kid turned around like happy, like they were going to ask him to play.  Oh, boy.  Five basketballs just went right into his face.  And you hear what Bobby's saying here.  People just don't get this.  This is what people...  I'm really happy you're saying this, finally.  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  Because two things.  One, Bobby played New York basketball with a bunch of black dudes in prison.  Now, you know what New York 21 is.  It's everybody for themselves.  So, it's like football, playing basketball.  So, he played that with them.  Yeah.  I got an elbow in the face.  Secondly, this is to these comedians out here, right?  That feel protected because we're all comedy people.  Bobby is really like a second from like killing somebody.  And I know this because I get that too.  Like a lot of these little skin...  Like Greg Rogel.  You know Greg Rogel?  Yeah.  The little scrawny Jew kid.  Yeah.  He walks around like with this fire.  Everybody's like, oh, you're such a fiery whoo. 
[00:24:30]  It's like, do you know how to squeeze your face off?  Do you understand?  But the fact is that we're in the same business.  So, I can't...  What's protecting him from getting...  You know, is the fact that we're in this business.  So, it's like people think that...  Bob's just a lot of...  I know Bobby for years.  And we didn't like each other when we first met.  I liked you.  No, you didn't.  Jesus Christ.  We were both like these alpha male dudes.  And I found out that Bobby is really this dude, man.  And he keeps from... 
[00:25:00]  I mean, I have to walk him through life a lot.  Every day.  I have to walk him through like not killing somebody, not doing something.  You know, dude.  And it's just like...  You know how...  And I know this.  This is just...  You know, Bobby got a lot of rage.  Can you tell him I was smoking a cigarette that I wasn't blowing you?  Oh, not...  I'm sorry about that.  I'm not going to know what that sound effect was.  But if you know Bobby, he's chain smoking.  Dude, this is...  He's a real...  You know, he's a real case that comedy is saving lives. 
[00:25:30]  For real.  You know what, dude?  I'm fucking...  I'm happy.  I know.  Because you know me.  So, then you went into foster homes?  I'd like to be able to tell you that Bob Kelly was able to hold off those boys.  But that's not real life.  The sisters got them.  Any man would give in to a phone book and a baseball bat to the back.  In Halifax, Bobby was here. 
[00:26:00]  Piss break, boss.  Tell us the story of how you got your buddy's peers for doing the roof work.  Doing the taxes.  By the way, to interrupt real fast, Peter Brady and his lovely, lovely young girlfriend,  the pictures are now up on opanthony.com to check out.  And you can check out what she was wearing, which was just ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  So, then your parents gave up on you?  Yeah.  They were like...  After you got arrested at 11, they just said, that's it.  They went...  My mother went in.  All of my friends got bailed out. 
[00:26:30]  My mother went into the judge's chambers with me, took all my paraphernalia, my pot, my bongs,  everything that I had hidden, put it on the desk.  She went, what do I do?  He said, let him go.  Just let him go through the system.  Oh.  And there you go.  And that's what she did.  She just said, fuck it.  I hope he didn't put it like that when you were sitting there.  What do we do?  Let him go.  I'm going?  No, no.  Through the system.  And then you finally get out.  Aren't you assuming you're going to go back with your parents?  I didn't want to go. 
[00:27:00]  No.  I thought...  First of all, I'll tell you why.  The first false home I went to was in Lynn.  It was this older couple.  They smoked weed.  Okay?  And the next door neighbor, their friends, the lady, used to fucking fuck with me.  Really?  And her boyfriend used to get me high.  So he'd take me out to get high and say, don't tell my girl.  Is that what's happening?  She'd take me over there.  Lynn was the white ghetto in Massachusetts.  And fucking blow me.  And so, you know, and then I'd hang out with my parents and smoke butts and get stoned. 
[00:27:30]  And they loved wrestling.  They were in the WWF back then.  So it was like, it was unbelievable.  Are you telling me comedy doesn't help heal lives?  Imagine if Bobby's just a regular square walking around.  Working a nine to five.  Not being able to talk about this and be funny.  Cubicle.  But most of them suck, though.  Instruction.  He'd be a guy that just comes on the job site and kills like three people.  You can see it on the news.  So you still talk to your mom?  Oh, yeah.  Me and my mom are friends now.  Just friends, though.  Like, there's no, like...  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I'm back with my family. 
[00:28:00]  I got a big Irish Catholic family.  What happened was is after...  When did you finally get back?  It seems like it took many, many years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Probably when I was like...  Jesus.  Look how uncomfortable you're fucking making him.  But you know what?  As you get older, Anthony, though, you start to...  Because I thought I was abused growing up by my mother.  I thought...  You know, my mother was 21 when she had me, you know?  So she's a kid.  Like, when I talk to 21-year-olds, I'm like...  Young, delicious, you know.  Imagine that trying to raise you.  So I'm...  By herself.  So you realize when you get older, you do... 
[00:28:30]  That went without saying, by the way.  Oh, Jesus.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Yeah.  Jesus.  You do.  It was so perfectly clear.  Oh, it was by herself.  Really.  Really prolific.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Is that in your dear Patrice?  There's a possibility that my father could have been around.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  There was a slight chance I had a dad.  Sometimes, sure.  So I'm just saying, once you get older...  I know we'd be calling the Guinness Book of World Records saying we found one. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, no offense.  It's a possibility.  Sure it is.  Sure it is.  Give me a break.  I'm not trying to be redundant here.  The guy's some slack.  All right.  Jesus.  So I'm just saying, 30, after you turn 30, you realize that you don't blame your parents  for what they did.  You realize...  You know what I mean?  So I'm sure you got...  I bet you at 25, he loved his mom.  Oh, yeah.  How old was your mom when you were doing this jail stuff?  16, 17.  She was like 29.  She was like 11, so...  She was 29, right? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, she was young.  Yeah, she was young.  All right.  So still in her 20s, maybe late 20s.  Yeah, that's no bullshit to have to deal with.  Young and delicious.  Young and delicious.  You know what?  I would go down to...  This is before I started getting into trouble.  I'd be like, Ma, I need help with my homework.  She'd open the book for two seconds, and she'd be like, I fucking hated this shit.  Go ask your sister.  And you used to look at it like mommy, but they're young.  When I talk to a 25-year-old, I'm like, you're going to get it.  Delicious.  She was a mommy.  Come on.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  30.  I'm 35.  30 years old is like, I got this one. 
[00:30:00]  You have a banging chick with a kid?  That's all my girls got kids.  I don't know a girl without a kid.  What?  Again?  Why the fuck are you even...  Because she has to go.  She has to get up and leave.  She's going to go wake her, take her kid to school.  Well, just finishing up, though.  So then it was juvie, foster homes, and then on your own at 18, I'm assuming then, right?  And then finally you were free?  Actually, I went back to my...  The last time, I went back to my parents' house. 
[00:30:30]  I had to leave because I couldn't deal.  Moved in with one foster father until I was legally able to move out.  And as soon as I was, I moved into a house with six retards.  And here's where I'm getting.  How did you find comedy through all this?  Go through that.  Through that, dude.  You had to be funny being raped.  When was the last time you saw a happy family dude that has money and lives in Connecticut?  I know all you comedians, bro.  I would have fucked up thing that happened.  Not all.  Not going to comedy. 
[00:31:00]  The ones that have any, like, you know, some power to their comedy certainly do.  It was only, I mean, you know.  99% of comics.  I tell you what, in Juvie Jail, the thing that got me through, honestly, like, I remember  the day all these black kids came into my room and they all surrounded me, but they  ghosted me.  They were ignoring me.  Like, they sat right on my bed.  Two of them up here when I was just lying there like this.  And they were ghosting me, like, talking about white dudes and blah, blah, blah.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:31:30]  And I was just sitting there reading my little fucking whatever book.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.  Yeah, right?  And I go, they go, yo, they said something about homeboys or white boys.  They go, you a homeboy, you a white boy.  And I said something like, I'm a homeboy, sir.  Some shit.  Just kidding.  Oh, no.  And there was silence for, like, a fucking second.  Like, I fucked up.  And they went, oh, man, you a funny motherfucker.  And I was fine.  There you go.  And that's where I learned how to be funny, man.  But, Bobby, but see, listen, this is the thing we talk about.  Another thing, Bob.  Oh, shit.  Secrets.  Can we have some of your secrets today?  I got a lot of secrets that everybody knows. 
[00:32:00]  Like, one.  Dude, we had a great segment with him.  Are you joking me, man?  I know, right?  You know I share all my problems.  I'm about his last dildos and everything.  We got deep with him, man.  Yeah.  He walked away going, yeah, there is really something wrong with me.  There's a problem.  We got into his head one time on this show.  Dr. Dildo.  We want Bob to talk about this.  Thank you, Opie, for letting him do this.  Because he wants to talk about cheese and slinkies on stage.  And because he's too scared to open up.  He doesn't think it's going to be funny.  I talk about that shit now.  Genius.  I had no idea.  I talk about fat stuff. 
[00:32:30]  I thought it was really interesting.  It's genius.  I didn't mean to throw you on, you know.  Genius.  Marshmallow yellow.  Hey, what's up?  It's Rob...  What are you talking about?  Oh, right then.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  Go to robertkellylive.com and find out when I'm coming to your town.  Again, that's robertkellylive.com.

So make sure you check them out and come down to one of my shows.  Later, bitches.  All right, do it one more time. 
[00:33:00]  No, you're good.  No, I want to do that.  I want to do that one more time.  I want this one.  Ready?  Hey, what's up?  It's Bob Kelly.  If you want to find out...  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, hey you!  Well, guess who's back?  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, it's Nick DiFallo, and this is the worst of Louis C.K., another red-headed fucking fag from Boston.  What am I reading? 
[00:33:30]  The red-headed fucking fag list from Boston?  Hey, we got Marge from Little Shelter on the line.  Let's get a Marge update.  Hey, Marge.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Shut up.  How are you today?  Let us start...  For once, let us start the conversation.  Marge.  We always monopolize Marge's conversation.  Marge!  I said shut up!  Thank you.  We had a cute little...  Good morning, Marge.  Marge.  Oh, my God.  No, you can't say it.  Marge!  Shh, shh, shh. 
[00:34:00]  Opie.  Shh.  Go ahead, Marge.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Hi, Marge.  I just wanted to say that the guy that answers the phone before you get on is the sweetest, loveliest...  Oh, yes.  Little girl.  He just kind of prepares you for the battle ahead.  Oh, does he?  He really does.  He softens you up, and he makes you think everything is...  You soften everyone up, Marge.  I've seen pictures.  And then, and then, you know that after I had the conversation with you, I had to go back 
[00:34:30]  to bed.  I was like worn out.  Good.  Yeah.  You should be.  Nice.  I'm going to explain to Louis C.K. what's going on with Marge from the little shelter out  there in Long Island.  First of all, Marge, we had a cute, feel-good story this morning.  Yeah, it was great.  You'd have loved this.  It was an animal story.  We don't have many.  You like animal stories, right?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the 62-year-old guy in Florida, he was doing something with his garbage, and he  saw a cat.  Saw a little cat looking at him.  Aw.  And he noticed that the cat didn't run away. 
[00:35:00]  He also noticed that the cat was a bobcat.  A bobcat.  So, what do you think this guy in Florida did to the bobcat?  I don't know.  You tell me.  I choked it out until it died.  All right.  Gentlemen.  He had to choke it because it attacked him, and it had rabies.  I wish that guy was on the phone right now because I would love to hear Marge's take on  the choking out of the bobcat.  Gentlemen?  Yes, Marge.  So, he had to choke out the little fella to save his own life. 
[00:35:30]  I, you know what?  I don't care what you say.  I know you really love animals.  That's why I permit myself to be so degraded, but I'm going to talk about your personal life.  You know, I've been getting calls from people.  Wait, wait.  I got to set up the bit.  From Ramon or Frunkus?  Yeah, right.  Who's calling?  Louis C.K. has no idea why we're talking to Marge.  I think I remember this woman.  Isn't she, does she have a shelter for animals?  Yes.  The animal shelter.  She calls up with the crazier's request. 
[00:36:00]  The other day, Marge calls up and said she needed Viagra for the animals.  For one of the dogs.  There's a female dog that needs the Viagra because she has a heartworm problem and the  Viagra opens up the blood vessels.  I thought the worms were soft and she wanted to harden them.  We were thinking that maybe Marge is doing something with the animals and the animals are like,  yuck.  So they need a little help.  You know, first of all, before we get into this, the nitty-gritty of this situation. 
[00:36:30]  Did you get your Viagra?  I, we have gotten 300, listen to me, 300 pills have been promised.  Really?  As far away as California.  But the thing that I want to tell you guys.  You know what's great about Marge?  She'll keep battling.  That's why you have to jump in.  She pretty much admitted on our show that she needs people to sell, I mean, to mail drugs to her.  You can't mail this stuff without a prescription there, Marge. 
[00:37:00]  The authorities are coming to get you and your stupid animals.  What?  Why do I think Opie is more sympathetic?  To animals?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow, you sure don't know the show.  You're going to try that.  That's interesting.  No one has tried that angle before.  Okay, listen.  Before I go and tell you some interesting stories, which I know you're going to just kill me for,  Uh-huh. 
[00:37:30]  Do you remember I made a suggestion yesterday?  That we go down to the little shelter and broadcast, do a live broadcast from the little shelter.  Do you know how many animals' lives would be saved because of that, Jess?  Three.  Three on the nose.  Yes.  Three goats and an iguana.  God.  You guys will have a special place in heaven if you do that.  Special place in heaven?  I'd rather roam free and have...  All right. 
[00:38:00]  Access to the whole heaven.  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't want a special place.  Now, you guys stay in this room with the other animal lover idiots.  What happened?  I want to just float around.  There's a rope.  There's bars you can't get into.  VIP rooms that aren't VIP rooms.  There's a back room that's better.  Of course.  It's the same in heaven?  Yep.  Sweethearts.  Are there booby bars in heaven?  Yeah.  I don't know what's in heaven.  Oh, we'll save that for Pot Talk on Monday.  But I know that there is a special place in heaven.  Yeah, it's probably next to a litter box.  That's where you want to be in heaven.  In the bathroom near a litter box. 
[00:38:30]  You're just smelling that.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Knowing me, I would do this nice gesture.  I'd go to heaven and then I'd have to spend eternity with a room full of cats and I'm allergic  to the damn things.  We have never gotten as much publicity as we have because of it.  Marge.  But it's all for the wrong reasons.  Yes.  Marge, you don't need 300 Viagra pills for this little thing.  It's a little darling little girl that she is.  Marge, honestly, let me ask you an honest question.  Has the shelter been hurt by the fact that you're a whore? 
[00:39:00]  How?  How?  Okay.  I just want to tell you that there's been people that are writing and calling in.  Yes.  And some of these things are really hysterical.  Now, I cannot, as you cannot say certain things on the air, I cannot say this word,  but I can sort of tell you it starts with F and ends with N.  And this person said...  Wait, it starts with S and ends with N?  Yeah.  Fun?  Because you bring none? 
[00:39:30]  Hold on.  Let's think of a word.  What is the word?  This woman said...  Is there a U in there?  An apostrophe?  What?  I got this...  Hold on, Marge.  ...or man said...  Starts with F, ends with N.  F and ends with N pills.  Don't do what they're supposed to do.  I may as well give them to the dog.  Starts with F.  Oh.  Ends with N.  Oh, okay.  Oh, so this woman's husband isn't getting...  Right, it's not working.  So she's going to give it to your dog.  Wait, wait.  All right.  Wait, the female is saying these pills don't work, right? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Because the guy is using the pills for some young chippy, you dummy.  Yes, exactly.  Oh.  That's what, when they show Viagra commercials, they shouldn't show a guy who looks like,  oh, jeez, I just can't...  They should show this woman, look at this woman who's as ugly as your ugly, smelly wife.  Here's a pill.  And a lot of these, a lot of these...  They should show a guy with a...  Shut up, Marge.  They should show a guy with a satisfied fat chick, and then he's bilking her out of her  life savings.  Like how great Viagra can be for you financially. 
[00:40:30]  She's crumbled in an emotional mess on a hotel floor.  You're skipping...  Yes, Marge.  ...Mexico with millions.  Yes, Marge.  Okay.  Got an email saying, everyone in the office is sneaking one pill from her husband's back.  Oh!  Most of us agree that the dog deserves the pill more than the guy's.  But you don't need that many pills.  Yeah, it sounds like a movie with Lily Tomlin in it.  I'll make this public and that.  Girls, let's get all the Viagra from our... 
[00:41:00]  I have a feeling that...  No good husbands.  I have a feeling that Marge is selling Viagra.  Get into that dog.  Some Dolly Parton comedy that nobody wants to see.  I have a feeling that she's selling Viagra out the back door at the little show.  I'm going to have to go back to bed again.  No, you're fine, Marge.  How's the catatorium doing?  Why do you have to go back to bed again?  Is the Viagra kicking in at the shelter?  I don't need Viagra.  Well, we didn't think you did.  Okay.  You give it to the dogs and then you pull out the peanut butter. 
[00:41:30]  I do not.  You've heard the stories.  I've seen the videos.  I do not need Viagra.  How is the...  Wasn't the roof leaking on the catatorium or the cateteria?  What is that called?  It's a cattery.  Cattery.  The cattery.  Wasn't the roof leaking?  We need money.  Were you plugging it up with Viagra?  And, you know, if you would be so kind as to do a remote from little shelter...  Do you understand, Marge? 
[00:42:00]  Marge, listen to me for a second.  You know about animals and the shelter and everything.  We know radio.  Do you know how utterly boring it would be for us to actually broadcast from a shelter?  Yeah, how are you doing today?  Just like yapping cats and dogs and hissing cats.  What would we say?  Give us a good break.  Give us...  You direct right now.  Give us a break that we would do from the little shelter. 
[00:42:30]  Go.  If you let them kill three cats during the show.  That's what I suggested.  Thank you, ACK.  I bet you, and you can ask your producer and all the directors and all the...  You think we have directors and producers?  You heard this show before?  It can't be.  Really, none of your animals deserve to die to give publicity to the others.  Just choose your three least favorite cats and kill them on the air,  and your shelter will be...  Marge, Louis is onto something. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  If you choke out a cat right now live on our show, we will do...  Oh, my God.  A remote.  A remote from a little shelter.  You know there's one cat in there that you're just like, shut up.  I hate this cat.  There has to be a cat that's up.  Even Marge, there's one that you're just like, oh, I hate this cat.  You know you're putting at least one cat down today because we know what you're really about.  So why don't you just choke it out live on the show, knowing it's going to be dead anyway by the end of the day,  and then we get some good radio, then we go down there and give you some boring radio.  Now, we've been voted the best shelter on Long Island, okay?  The only shelter.  Wait, hold on, Marge. 
[00:43:30]  Who voted?  Yeah, who voted?  I didn't get a ballad.  Was there a booth with a hole in it?  The people who gave Mike North the man of the year award.  Yeah, they are.  They're the ones who gave her the...  Who is Irv Cupsinette?  What?  Who is Irv Cupsinette?  Irv Cupsinette, he's very big in Chicago.  Don't say his name and don't...  No, no, no, that was the award.  Oh, it was.  Mike North received the Irv Cupsinette Award.  I thought he was like a reporter or something, a writer.  Wow.  I don't know.  Maybe you know more than us about radio there, Marge. 
[00:44:00]  Maybe we should do a remote.  Hey, Marge.  Getting any action or what?  Yeah, Marge.  Let us know.  We want to know a little bit more about Marge.  We want to know a little bit about Marge.  You know so much about us.  When was the last time you had a little romp in the hay?  Yeah.  I'm not saying.  Come on.  Aw, come on.  Who was president?  Yes.  You can ask me certain questions.  With a non-white.  When's the last time you rolled around with a non-white?  Gentlemen.  Yes.  If you come to Little Shelter...  How close did you get to having relations with a dog? 
[00:44:30]  Let's get into this for real.  ...about my personal life.  What?  Oh?  What?  I saw a picture of Marge.  I think she's a goer.  How old is Marge?  I think she'll go.  Marge, how old are you?  I'm not saying.  You should be on a smuggler's job.  All right, Marge, last time that you did have an evening with a gentleman, did you feel...  Right afterwards, did you feel good or silly?  Oh, that's a good question.  Or sad?  I'll answer that question.  That's a good question.  Give me three options.  Okay.  Okay, silly. 
[00:45:00]  Sad.  Unconscious.  Hogtied.  Three.  Give me three.  Black and blued.  Go ahead.  Three.  Okay.  Delicious.  Ashamed.  Ashamed.  Good one.  Delicious, ashamed, or...  Or wanting more.  Or sleepy.  Or up 15 bucks.  I will answer the question.  Okay.  How'd you feel?  All right, Marge.  Delicious. 
[00:45:30]  Oh.  Yuck.  That's what the dog thought.  Why'd you feel delicious?  Delicious, Marge.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Why?  Because it's personal.  Because she's a sexy woman.  Is it a man you see from time to time, or what?  Yep.  Oh, you're not married?  Are you married?  Nope.  He is, though, right?  Nope.  Oh, there was a pause there.  What was the pause?  We know all about the pause.  I don't mean the pause that you're, you know, cutting off. 
[00:46:00]  We're not talking about the pause and there are marks on your back.  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch Marge up.  Do you at least let the cats watch oven mitts?  Do you at least let the cats watch?  Those dewclaws are a bitch.  They have to tape the oven mitts so they don't fall off the German shepherds' hands, and he just feels silly.  You know the cats are watching because they're voyeuristic freaks.  Come on, Marge.  The big things, and don't make a mistake about the big things. 
[00:46:30]  What?  One of the surprising things, as I said, is how many women are responding.  Oh, really?  And listen to this.  Okay.  This is a little tidbit.  My girlfriend and I were watching the news and saw Ingrid.  We are both dog lovers, so we decided to make a supreme sacrifice and send 10 kills.  Now, wait.  She says, we don't do it that often anyway.  Well, but see, what you don't understand, Marge, is the guy is still doing it somewhere else. 
[00:47:00]  These are women, honey.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah, she's saying we don't do it often.  Did you know that women take Viagra, too?  Yeah, I've heard.  So, I mean, this is...  Wayne, in Franklin Square, you're on with Marge from the little shelter.  How you doing, boys?  Hey.  Hello, Jimmy.  Hi.  Marge, I represent an auto parts store in Franklin Square, Long Island. 
[00:47:30]  It's called US1 Auto Parts.  We will donate $500 to the cattery of Little Shelter if you club a puppy over the head with  a miniature souvenir baseball bat.  Marge, will you hit a puppy on his head with a little souvenir baseball bat for $500 for  your cattery?  This is an excellent...  I would hit him with a club, and I don't want the $500.  He should just pass away.  No, not Wayne from Franklin Square.  Not Wayne?  A puppy.  No, the puppy. 
[00:48:00]  Just pick one of the dogs you're putting down today anyway.  Nobody touches a hair on any animal's head.  Wait, let's CBS make some money.  That little shelter.  Hold on.  Let's CBS make some money.  How about with one of those Bud Light baseball bat bottles?  Oh, nice.  We can get it sponsored.  Yeah.  How come, gentlemen?  Yes.  How come you don't put a call through from a person that understands our plight?  You really think the board is lit up?  No, they are.  You know, Marge is...  Hold on, Marge.  You're right.  When you're right, you're right. 
[00:48:30]  You know, we like to have all voices heard on our show, so we do have one of those.  It's Matt in Connecticut.  You're on with...  He's from Connecticut.  A very civilized state, Marge.  Yes, they're very...  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead, Matt.  You're on with...  Matt, you're on with Marge from Little Shelter.  Good morning, Matt.  I think it'd be more interesting if you hit the puppy with a fucking golf club.  Well...  Matt, you're not allowed to say that word.  I just...  Tee it off in the front yard.  What?  Golf club?  Come on, guys.  Do me a favor.  One call.  But this is a great formula. 
[00:49:00]  You could have...  One call.  Half your animals will live like kings.  The other half get hurt badly.  All right, look.  Give us a call.  It seems like a pretty good...  Give me one call.  Give us a call.  Serious comments only for Marge and serious inquiries only, please.  We are in America, and, you know, we should run your shelter like we run America.  Some people have it really good, and others...  Yeah, other people have to...  Others don't have it too well.  Yeah, other people are homeless.  Right, so...  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now, if you do something unusual to one of your pets at Little Shelter,  we'll open the floodgates. 
[00:49:30]  Other pets will prosper.  Then we'll never be able to see eye to eye.  Uh, Marge...  I love that she's like...  She's so rational.  She's so solemn.  Marge, think of this.  Look, could you just get one of the dogs and just smack him across the face so he goes...  Just one little yelp from the dog.  That would be worth $100 from me.  I'm throwing in another $100.  Yeah, we got $200 right there.  I'll give $500.  $700.  $700 we're up to.  I can smack Matt across the face. 
[00:50:00]  No, just smack the dog until it goes...  You guys...  He'll forget.  He's a dog.  He won't even remember why you smacked him.  And then you'll have money for the cattery.  I hit my dog all the time by mistake.  Yeah.  She thinks, like, sometimes I'll turn it around and I, like, I elbow my dog...  Shut up.  Shut up for a second.  Like, I don't even know this woman.  I'll elbow my dog in the eye by mistake.  That's an accident.  She yelps and looks at me like, I'm sorry that I was standing here.  That the dog did something wrong. 
[00:50:30]  And I can't explain.  My dog does not believe that it's an accident.  My dog thinks I hit her on purpose.  Right.  And then it goes...  And then I pat her on the head.  It's over.  And they forget it.  How about we...  And I have sex with her, but that's another thing.  All right, hold on.  We have to take a break, Marge.  I think it's only fair that we take a couple serious questions for you.  Yeah.  We're going to get a bunch of people that want to talk to you about the little shelter.  So could you hold on the line throughout the commercials, Marge?  Marge?  Marge?  Hold on through the commercials.  Wait a minute before I...  Shut up.  We have to go to a commercial, Marge.  I know, but I have to take a whiff of oxygen. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  Are you kidding?  Okay, do that.  Yeah, you know what?  Light a cigarette at the same time.  That's what half the dogs are saying over there, but they don't get that opportunity.  It's not oxygen.  How do they?  Okay.  Zyklon B that she's dropping through the cattery roof.  We got Marge from the little shelter.  Marge.  Now, Marge.  Beat your dogs.  Hi, Marge.  Beat your dogs for money. 
[00:51:30]  That's the promotion we want to do.  That's what you should say.  Beat a dog for money for the cats.  Marge.  It's like a cartoon.  Marge, you promised me that you were going to have some nice calls.  Yeah, we've been going through the calls for the last 15 minutes.  It's very hard, but we've screened a few calls that are very supportive of you and  the little shelter and your cause.  Can I just, let me just ask one question, which is kind of like when you ask a woman  like for $10 million, you know, and then you go, now we're just negotiating price that  whole time.  Marge, if we raised a million dollars for you, contingent on you just slapping one dog in 
[00:52:00]  the face.  The answer is no.  Really?  A million dollars.  To sacrifice one dog's, like, feelings for a second to help all those other animals.  Think about it.  Nope.  That's like a hero dog.  What about $100 million with which, if you had $100 million, you could save every dog  and cat in the world.  Yeah.  You would literally save both species.  You could change the name to the big shelter, finally. 
[00:52:30]  Marge.  The big shelter.  Marge, you're not sane.  We do this with humans.  Why not with pets?  You would not slap a dog in the face to save thousands.  People that look at animals are much nicer than people that just look at animals.  No, they're right.  Marge, how about this?  Would you say for $50, take a thumbtack and stick a note to a dog's nose that says, I'm  a dog and I suck.  That little leathery nose, all wet. 
[00:53:00]  All he would have is a little red dot there for about a week and he'd be fine.  We're going to make Marge go back to bed again.  You know this, right?  Marge.  Marge.  Marge.  Just remember this.  You got 300 Viagra pills coming illegally in the mail to the little shelter thanks to  the Opie and Anthony shelf.  Marge, could I ask you one thing?  Blood on the note.  For all the money you could imagine, would you just take a dachshund or a basset hound,  you know a basset hound, right, with those big floppy ears and hold the ears together  above his head and staple them together so he looks silly? 
[00:53:30]  No, but I would staple your ears together.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  For $100,000, would you take a dog's face and just look at it and say, you stink.  Yeah, would you even talk to a dog mean?  Yeah.  For $100,000.  For $100,000.  Would you talk mean to a dog?  Would you tell your favorite dog that he stinks?  Wait a minute, let me think, because, you know, sometimes it's the tone and the voice. 
[00:54:00]  No, it has to be the real tone.  You got to sell it.  No, you got, yeah, Marge, you got to sell it.  $100,000.  Sell it like you're yelling at a guy who didn't satisfy you in bed.  $100,000.  I could say something to...  Like what?  ...one of my little friends like this.  What would you say?  You know, honey...  No, honey.  No, Marge.  It better be, you know, honey, I'm sorry I chopped your nose off.  I can't start an insult with, you know, honey.  Marge, I'm in that tone.  You made an offer. 
[00:54:30]  Now, let's see if you're going to stick to the...  I didn't make an offer.  I said, if.  The key word was if.  These are hypothetical situations like OJ's murder.  All right.  That is a hypothetical answer, okay?  All right.  Hypothetical answer.  For $100,000, right?  Yeah.  I would take a little face in my hand and I would say to that little face, to the smile  on my face, oh, sweetheart, no, I really don't like you that much. 
[00:55:00]  Wow.  I would almost pay that.  That's almost good.  That's almost good.  I would pay $100 for that.  Where's the $100,000?  We said F, Marge.  I said it was hypothetical.  For that, I would give you $100.  Marge, you got the 300 Viagra pills coming in.  Here's the real offer.  In the mail, illegally.  Remember that.  And when they bust you for drug trafficking, leave our names out of it.  How much ecstasy you need?  That's going to be shipped to the little shelter.  You're going to have mobsters coming to the back door looking for dope.  Marge, here's a real offer.  Okay?  The guys have been silly geese.  My apologies. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's how I accept them.  Take a chihuahua.  And this is for $63.  $63.  And I want you to grab the chihuahua by its ears.  And I want you to squeeze its ears until your knuckles, until your fingernails are digging  back into your own skin through its ears.  And I want you to put your face by it with your old lady breath.  And I want you to scream racial epithets into its face.  $63 there, Marge.  That's $63. 
[00:56:00]  Dollar Roonies.  How about...  By the way, Marge, I have to thank you.  I get the little shelter, the address labels all the time.  So I, you know, it's got my name on it and my address, and I'm able to mail things out.  Yeah.  I throw away everything else that comes with it, but I use the address labels.  Thank you.  Hey, let's get back to the chihuahua.  How about this?  Let's just get silly with the chihuahua and get him penis enlargement surgery.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Them walking around?  Just give him a... 
[00:56:30]  If you take a chihuahua and have a friend of yours hold its paw and walk away from your  friend, like 10 feet away, and your friend has to still be holding the paw, and you have  to still have the chihuahua in your hands.  You can figure out how that's done.  You can have $88.42.  Wow.  Marge, let's calm you down.  Marge, let's calm you down a little bit.  We're running out of show on this side of the Opie and Anthony program.  We got a little song we want you to hear.  This will get everyone calm. 
[00:57:00]  This is like a fundraiser song.  You know how they do it on the Jerry Lewis telethon?  They play music.  Well, here you go.  If you like this song...  Send your contributions.  Send your Viagra and all your illegal drugs to the little shelter out there in Huntington.  Marge needs crystal meth.  Here we go.  Starts off nice, right?  It's nice.  It's a sing-along.  This is good.  It really is.  It's a pretty guitar.  Follow the bouncing balls.  When the game of life makes you feel like quitting, it helps a lot if you kill a kitten. 
[00:57:30]  Mark my words.  It's a nice song.  It's pretty.  Where I'm sitting.  You can't go wrong if you kill a kitten.  Listen close, Marge.  I don't.  Here comes this part.  You'll love it. 
[00:58:00]  Pretty.  There's no crime that you'll be committing.  I know the law.  You can...  Everybody.  Kill a kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Marge, sing along.  It's Kill a Kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Ready?  Kill a Kitten.  Come on, Marge.  Sing along.  You have no...  Listen. 
[00:58:30]  Here's some ideas.  It should be on the song.  Her saying that in the background.  You awful.  Kill a Kitten.  Kill a Kitten.  What is she saying?  Listen up.  She's just not happy with the song, I don't think.  Suggesting methods.  What, Marge?  Problem, Marge?  I said, didn't you take your little doggies with you when you went to the fishing hole?  Yes.  That sound here is this.  It sounds like Anthony Hopkins. 
[00:59:00]  Didn't you take your little doggies with you when you went to the fishing hole, Clarice?  Yes, I'm Huck Finn.  My German Shepherd chased Jim into the water.  Because me, Weezer, and Jack, and Petey came along with us.  All right, Marge, we're running out of show.  If Huck Finn had a dog, German Shepherd, that book would have been one page thick.  So this is what we learned.  We learned that Marge needs Viagra for the female dogs and bear traps, right? 
[00:59:30]  No comment.  Money for the cattery.  She's tired.  She's got to go back to bed.  Now, that's what we need.  Money for the Little Shelter Medical Center.  Medical Center?  What the hell is this?  This is something new every time.  There's going to be a complex down Warner Road that takes up a mile.  Son of a dream.  With all the money you're going to be getting.  Come on, guys.  All right, Marge.  All right, Marge.  We've got to go.  We've got to go.  Give generously to the Little Shelter.  We're kind of fading you out like you fade out the lives of some of those animals down  there.  Goodbye, Marge.  Turning on the gas. 
[01:00:00]  This is Louis C.K., and if you're interested in where I'm playing live, go to LouisCK.com.  If you're not interested in where I'm playing live, just shit in a hat and put it on.  It's the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program.  It's the best, the best of the worst of the comics on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, what's up?  It's Patrice O'Neal, and this is the worst of Billy Burr.  Yeah?  What's he going to talk about?  What the fuck is Billy?  What's Billy's worst of?  Is there any other kind of Billy besides the worst of?  No, let me stop before he's like, dude, you know, we're supposed to be friends.  Look, this is the, this is, let me say this is the best of Billy Burr.  Okay, Billy?  What happened in Camden, New Jersey this past Saturday with Bill Burr? 
[01:01:00]  Stuff of legend.  It really is.  I suggest you go to YouTube and check out the entire performance of him just taking on  the entire crowd.  But we have some highlights here.  A little booing going on.  There were a couple of little boors out in the crowd.  Yeah, we should set this up again just in case people weren't listening yesterday there,  Jimmy.  What was the vibe?  What, I mean, what was going on? 
[01:01:30]  It was getting rough.  They booed Jimmy Schubert early.  I mean, again, Philly is notoriously rough.  And then Tracy got them back.  And, you know, the show was going well, but Philly crowds are always on the verge.  They were right on the brink at any minute.  And the second half of the show started, Bobby Kelly went out and just kicked ass.  Boss killed.  Everybody, for the most part, killed.  Jimmy Schubert was destroyed.  I'm going to give Drew Boogie some props.  He did a great job as a DJ, man.  He held it together. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, believe me, that's a lot more important than people realize to keep the music going,  keep people happy with what they're listening to.  And then Bobby Kelly kills.  Dom Herrera goes out.  He's doing well.  And then he loses them a little bit.  They boo him a little bit, which was really weird to see Herrera get booed.  He's such a good comic.  I know, and a legend.  But it was late.  And, again, these psychos have been drinking since 11 a.m.  So, I mean, they're getting a little rowdy.  They booed him a little bit, but he handled it.  He handled it better than Schubert did, because Schubert, I think, just, like, went on autopilot.  Whereas Dom kind of, I think, addressed it a little bit or slowed it. 
[01:02:30]  Whatever he did, he made it work, and he left.  Billy Berry comes on.  And from what I saw, Bill's first bit or something didn't work, which happens a lot to us as comics.  You know what I mean?  You just come on, and your bit doesn't hit.  It's no big deal.  You want to open strong, though, don't you?  Yeah, but you do.  But, again, Billy is in a position on the show where everybody knows him and likes him, and he's really funny.  So he doesn't have to prove himself.  It's like if you're bombing for 10 minutes, they're going to give you a hard time.  Right.  But one bit, they'll usually, yeah, no big deal.  But I think Bill got annoyed at them because they booed Herrera and said something to them about it. 
[01:03:00]  I was watching this on a monitor, and then they started booing him.  Started booing Bill.  And it got really loud, and I'm like, are they booing Burr?  And then I just heard him snap, and he had a moment of clarity.  He was going to go down and bomb horribly, or he was going to attack back, and he attacked back.  He knew.  In a lovely fashion.  He had time backstage to say to himself, look, if this happens to me out there, I know how I'm going.  I know what direction I'm taking.  He was a third guy.  So he threw his act away. 
[01:03:30]  Yep.  And then just improv for like 12 minutes and just beat up Philly.  Slammed him.  Everyone is talking about this.  Everybody is talking about this performance.  So, Tham, what's the first clip?  Him getting into the rant?  Yeah, that's when the wheels start.  Well, the wheels don't come off, I guess, because he killed.  But, yeah, it's just him.  It's none of his actual, like, normal bits.  Right.  It's just the start of when he starts losing it.  Okay, so, yeah, the setup, basically, he did his act, started doing his act. 
[01:04:00]  The booing started, and he said, you know what?  Screw you all.  And this is what started to happen.  You don't stop talking, do you?  Like, ah, f*** it.  I'll just cook this side for a while.  You know what's funny?  I'm cooking my brain talking about nothing.  I know.  I'm just walking around like, yeah, I just got a cheeseburger.  I'll f*** all you people.  You know what, you f*** losers.  I hope you all f*** die.  And I hope the f*** Eagles never win the Super Bowl. 
[01:04:30]  I'll f*** them.  I'll f*** all you f***ing f***ers.  And f*** the players.  F*** all you.  I'm not, you f*** losers.  I'm not, my rarer.  F*** the f***.  All you.  Oh, f*** them.  How's that?  No, I'm segueing into my next joke.  You get all burned f***ing by f***ing red f***ing all of you.  You line up in your Harold Carmichael f***ing jersey.  And one at a time, you get all f***ing by f***ing. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, my God.  How many beefs are in that?  Was that the beginning of the tirade right there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's funny.  You could see Bill with the line about the cheeseburger.  As a comic, he could see right there.  He's really floundering internally going, all right.  That was his moment of truth.  It's like, I'm going to try to just turn this around with this.  And then it just, they gave him a little hard time.  That was him standing at the crossroad right there.  It was like, all right, do I continue with the cheeseburger joke? 
[01:05:30]  Just talking.  Because I think he felt, again, like you said, the wheel's coming off.  And he was trying to steer.  All right, let me get back off the shoulder here.  And then he just kind of saw his wheel rolling in front of the car.  And he just aimed for the children.  Is this worth playing with all the beeps?  I think it's, at least play a couple of clips.  I think it's funny with the beeps to just show how vicious it was.  It is funny with the beeps.  It was.  Yeah.  Please play a little.  It took me over two hours to do.  All right, no problem.  But the people listening on XM, don't worry.  Later on this morning, we're going to play the whole thing in entirety without the beeps. 
[01:06:00]  That's right.  No bitching.  You'll have to hear a couple of commercials.  But aside from that, we'll play it for you.  No bitching.  Bill's thing is sponsored by Bud.  And for the people that don't have XM, just go to YouTube and throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  And you'll get to see this for yourself as well.  Or get XM.  Or get it, you Opie.  How about you throw that out there as an option?  No, you've got to balance the two here.  Don't you get what's going on?  Well, he needs today, too.  If you push XM too much, then the people down the hall here get pissed off. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, I know.  And if you don't push XM enough, then XM down there in Washington gets pissed off.  It's a balancing act.  We're like spinning plates here.  I'm looking at poor Elo's face over here on Pal Talk.  And, you know, I just figured, hey, there's an option perhaps.  Do you think I was saying it without saying it?  That's how smart I am.  I was keeping everybody happy.  I don't like his creepy goatee.  It hasn't grown in yet.  I don't care.  He looks Puerto Rican and I don't like it. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  Here's some more.  Bill Burr takes on Philly on stage at the Tweeter Center.  This is where he gets into the whole cancer thing.  Harold Carmichael jerseys, by the way, made me really happy. 
[01:07:30]  Let's talk about heart disease.  You're all going to die of.  And I'm going to laugh at your funeral.  It's going to be great.  You're all going to get cancer, which is fantastic because all your heads are shaved anyway.  No one's even going to notice.  You're going to get fired for coming to work too late because then I'm going to notice that you have bone marrow cancer.  The only thing that's going to give it away is me laughing at you in the background.  You bunch of losers with your cell phone pictures. 
[01:08:00]  You're a fucking stupid dick.  Fee, fee, fee, fee, fee, fee, fee.  How many more minutes of this?  And then he starts counting down how many more minutes he has.  It's like when Dom started getting booed, he cut his set.  Bill's like, not only I'm not cutting my set, I'm doing every single minute I was supposed to do.  He's counting down every minute he's doing.  That takes balls.  Is it worth playing?  We'll continue.  I just love hearing the beeps, actually.  At the end there, I don't even know what he was saying. 
[01:08:30]  It was just beep, beep, beep.  Well, then he got into the Ben Franklin Bridge down there in Philly.  I hope you all get in your board focuses.  You drive off the side of that faggot-ass Ben Franklin bridge.  You one bridge having.  He's a city that no one gives a f*** about.  The terrorists, the terrorists will never bomb you people because you're f***ing worthless  and no one cares about you.  You are this high above New Orleans. 
[01:09:00]  The people will never show up for you f***ing f***.  I hope your mother has herpes in the center of her f***.  As you go home tonight, f*** gets to get in on your f***.  And some other horrific f*** happens in bald cancer.  People, all of you, 11 minutes left.  11 minutes.  Oh, did he go on?  You're one step above New Orleans.  No one cares about you. 
[01:09:30]  No one cares about you.  Oh, wow.  Should we go on?  I can't get enough of this now.  I'd say at least one more.  You have to.  You have to.  Then he goes after Rocky and the Eagles.  That was great.  Rocky is your hero.  The whole crowd of your city is built around a f*** guy who doesn't even exist.  You've got to f***.

[01:17:00]  concentrating on that  and uh  it was odd  I watched what he was  doing and I just  kind of felt like  yeah he got him back  it was just  it was great to watch  man  it was great to see  him pull that  nightmare  and make it something  and he made it  something really funny  and it's  the crowd as much  as they wanted to  smash him  he respected  what he did  he got 10,000 people  to turn around  and respect  they loved him  when he left the stage  oh yeah  he got a tremendous  ovation  gave him a huge  ovation  when he was done  except for one guy  in the front row  wanted to beat him up  yeah one guy  was truly

[01:19:30]  Ted  yes  let's go  yeah I was  at the  stadium on  Sunday  or on  Saturday  night  and I was  sitting up on  the lawn  and everybody  was sitting on  the left hand  side going nuts  you guys still  even there  yeah we're  listening  we're listening  we're really  good listeners  your storytelling  skills stink  well everybody  on my left  was absolutely  going nuts  Bill and  Burr and then  all of a sudden  he would say  something and  the entire  crowd would  unite in 
[01:20:00]  Bill and  and then  on the right  hand side  we'd all start  going nuts  when he actually  started being  funny again  I tell you  it's one of  the best  sights I've  ever seen  gotta thank  Ted because  he kind of  let us know  when the  segment was  pretty much  done  I know  you took  a fun  interesting  story and  you built  a quick  brick wall  up  congratulations  you're a  drunk driver  in a limousine 
[01:20:30]  on the way  to a reception  congratulations  Ted  good job  everyone was  having fun  and now  just tragedy  that's right  I guess  you're a 6-1  blood alcohol  level plowing  into the bride  and groom  I guess we  have to take  a break now  thank you  ladies and  gentlemen  heroes  you know  you've heard  a lot about  heroes  I'm sure  today  watching the  news coverage  that does  it pales in  comparison  to the hero  that is in  our studio  right now  Mr. Bill  Burr 
[01:21:00]  what's up  Bill  wow  we just  discussed  your  what did  you guys  do this  weekend  oh  Jesus  we just  discussed  your set  in Camden  discussed  it  we watched  it in the  office  it's already  a bootleg  on YouTube  I watched  it at home  last night  I cannot  get enough  of it  it is the  most watchable  act I've  ever seen  it's like  you could  look at it  you could  watch it  ten times  and catch  something new  every time  animals  yeah  I literally 
[01:21:30]  had a headache  at the end  I felt like  I yelled at  a relative  you know  what it  reminded me  of  it's like  somebody  that should  get the  congressional  medal  for rushing  a machine  gun nest  and actually  living through  it  like  it's  in one  man  single-handedly  took out  an entire  machine gun  nest  and bunker  emplacement  thought you  were gone  thought you  were dead  you turn  that around  can you  walk us  through it  we just  we have no  idea what 
[01:22:00]  really happened  we're just  getting phone  calls and  things like  that  you walked  out on  stage  I guess  it was  after  Dom Herrera  no it was  actually  it was  after the  show was  about  three hours  and 15  minutes  old  and ideally  Jim what would you say  about 90 minutes  is the ideal  comedy show  yes and  you want to go on  probably 50 minutes  into the 90 minutes  at the latest  an hour  at the latest  ideally  the people aren't  drinking in a parking lot  for seven hours  before the three hours  and 15 minutes  starts  it was basically 
[01:22:30]  I don't know what  it turned into  Ozfest  up on the lawn  yeah  and they were  booing guys  like even guys  who were doing  well  I was kind  of walking  to the side  and they were  booing  and it was  just getting  worse and worse  so you heard  where it was  coming from  I really had  no idea  they kept saying  it was up  to the left  it sounded to me  when I was out  there like it was  coming from  everywhere  but so anyway  so then Dom  goes out  and Dom's  doing a great  job  and it's just  almost like  they just  decided 
[01:23:00]  yeah  out of nowhere  to start booing  the guy  and this is like  this guy's like  from Philly  he's been  doing it  forever  half the reason  they got comedy  clubs in that  damn city  is because  this guy  they boo him  off like they  don't even  know him  so  unbelievable  and he's  Dom's funny  I mean he  doesn't deserve  to be booed  he's a great  comic  exactly  so I was  pissed  and I went  out there  and the second  I walked out  I was like  you know  hey  you know  whatever  I was walking  down the street  did ya  they started  yelling  and heckling  oh boy  and then I went  into that Hitler  bit and I was  like oh no 
[01:23:30]  they've been  playing this on  Opian Ante  like 9000 times  and then they  started booing  me  and fortunately  I had been  booed before  and I made  I had made  mental notes  about things  that I did  that I liked  and didn't like  and there was  a lot more  stuff that I  didn't like  so I just  I had made  a mental note  the next time  whatever happened  I'm talking  about all  your mothers  I'm trashing  your city  anything I can  think about  and I'm not  the Liberty Bell  Rocky  the Betsy Ross  Bridge 
[01:24:00]  Cheesesteak  the fact  they hate  blacks  sports teams  exactly Anthony  I swear to God  I already mentally  worked it out  if they started  throwing stuff  I was going to  go behind the DJ booth  and I was still  going to finish  I just was not  you were dedicated  to finishing  oh yeah  I was in the back  watching  oh it was fantastic  again because you  couldn't hear the  audience response  from the monitors  and I saw you go  what are you people  not going to laugh  like you just  scolded them  like Bill  you are like  I hate to say 
[01:24:30]  money in the bank  it's a faggot  expression  you never had bad  sets  especially gigs  like this  I'm like  how could they  give Bill  a hard time  and then you  just went  crazy  it was so good  and he made  all this up  off the cuff  and we need  to tell people  that again  this wasn't  your act  this wasn't  what you decided  to do in Philly  you were just  making it up  as you go along  in front of  10,000 people  that to me  I bow to you  today  that was the  funny thing  I had a bunch  of people  that had come  up to me  not all those  people afterwards  probably at least  15 people  had come up  to me  and they were like  did you just  make that up 
[01:25:00]  or is that  like part of  your act  that's 15 minute  chunk of my act  when I go to  Seattle  I just go off  on specific  stuff about Philly  and somehow  it kills  that's what I was  amazed at too  it's like  god this guy  knows a lot  about Philly  dude you should  be gleaning  tours there  in your time  off  it was frightening  everything about  Philly  he just recalled  stuff subconsciously  that he heard  in school  it was like  your whole  brain worked  for you  and the team's  old players  from the  Phillies  like he's  just Roman  Gabriel  he's pulling 
[01:25:30]  up old players  from  Joe Frazier  you mentioned  Roman Gabriel  and the lack  of respect  he gets  you don't know  who he is  you just  you mentioned  him  and then you  screamed at  them  they're not  going to win  ever  they're never  going to win  it was good  to see the real  Bill Burr  finally  because we know  this is what  you're really  about  and it finally  came out  for everybody  it was fantastic  to watch  you saw the reason  why I need to  do this  to me  when I was  watching that  like when 
[01:26:00]  you're watching  you yell  like that  and just  just  just berate  them  I'm like  that's what  Bill hears  in his head  every time  he looks  into the mirror  I never loved  anyone as much  as I loved  watching you do  that  and you  you completely  turn them  around  when you  were done  and you  did your  little countdown  every  every minute  like I said  there's a  teleprompt  they're showing  the comics  how much  time they  had left  and you  berate the  audience  and they  go okay  six minutes  and you  kept going  and going  and I'm 
[01:26:30]  selling my  CD  and I'm  selling my  CD  and then  you turned  them around  and they're  laughing their  asses off  now the  laughs are  much bigger  than the  boos  but the  boos  continued  right  and you  you knew  you had  them  and then  you're  like  and I  still  hate  you  people  yeah  I still  hate  you  people  and when  you left  they gave  you a hell  of an ovation  just for  for doing  that  I gotta tell  you  it was one  of the most  amazing  things I've  ever seen  I never  saw a set  like that  in my  life  as far  as comic  things go  the brutal  honesty of  what you  did  and the fact  that it  was  it looked 
[01:27:00]  fearless  I mean  as a comic  I understand  how we are  internally  but just  the fact  that you  exploded  and weren't  gonna back  down  and they  knew  he's not  leaving  he's not  leaving  he will  not leave  you can only  boo so loud  so they  just knew  that you  were gonna kick  10,000 people  in the face  for 15 minutes  until your time  was up  and it was  just great  Tony Montana  up on the  balcony  getting shot  come on  and that guy  that guy  walked up to  your back  with a shotgun  and you  turned around  and you  slapped him  with your  hog 
[01:27:30]  it was  blind rage  by the end  to the point  when I got  off  I wasn't  even  I was  really  when I  walked back  there  I didn't  know  what the  reaction  of you  we all  ran to  the stage  because  the word  spread  Bill Byrd  getting booed  and he's  just attacking  the crowd  we all  every single  person backstage  just about  was on the  side stage  just watching  we're jumping  up and down  we're hugging  each other  we're falling  on the ground  like idiots  we loved it  having gay sex  just had a mention 
[01:28:00]  that's right  that's what I  told myself  in the rest area  last night  this one's  for Billy  and someone  bootlegged it  it's up on  YouTube  and the word  hasn't even  really spread  I mean  now it has  obviously  because we're  talking about  but this morning  it was already  downloaded  thousands of  times  I'm like  man  people are  talking about  this thing  you go to  YouTube  and just throw  Opie and Anthony  in the search  and there it is  it's there  the first time  I got booed  that there's this  amazing feeling  when you just  realize you can't  get them back 
[01:28:30]  and the first time  I got booed  I didn't leave  that time  but I kept  trying to do  jokes or something  I didn't leave  or whatever  and then they  ended up bringing  me off  and people came  up to me  afterwards  going  I got  these awful  compliments  like  I thought  you were funny  and the best  one was  you mean  all the compliments  Jimmy Schubert  was getting  after his set  he just got  thrown to the  dogs  oh my god  Jimmy Schubert  is hilarious  that was the thing  because I love  Jimmy so I was  pissed from the  beginning of the 
[01:29:00]  show  and having  gotten booed  I know what  he was going  through  then he's got  to stand  there for  the five  hours  and you two  guys  Jesus Christ  before I go  up  these two  stand up  virgins  hey we got  this great  idea  we're going  to walk  40 rows  through the  crowd  that's great  anything you  can do  to steal  their focus  more from  the  so we get  credit for  your brilliant  set that  people will  be talking  about for  years  and then  they come  with a  concert 
[01:29:30]  and right  after we  intro you  50 rows  in  the two  stars  of the  shows  we're just  going to  cut off  the lights  and they're  not going  to look  at us  and try  to find  out where  we're  I thought  that was  a little  ridiculous  too  like I  was like  uh oh  this  could be  distracting  to the  comedian  we make  it up  as we  go along  what can  I tell  you  we won't  do that  again  Bill  but Jimmy  Shearer  was your  biggest cheerleader  on the side  of the stage  he was jumping  up and down  just applauding  oh yeah  we were joking  about that  afterwards  I felt like  we caught  the last  chopper  on a  nom  we were  going to  look down 
[01:30:00]  and see  like Dom  Irera  like Willem  DeFoe  in the  tree line  it was brutal  it was  it was  platoon  you must  have seen  him though  getting booed  know what  it's like  to be booed  saw what  the crowd  is like  and kind  of prepared  yourself  like if  these sons  of bitches  even try  I am unloading  my mindset  when I walked  out was  you animals  you don't  even deserve  a show  I'm gonna  come out  here and  I'm gonna  start tap  dance  and try  to get  your attention  you're not  even giving  anybody  any chances 
[01:30:30]  so the  second they  started  you were  already locked  and loaded  ready to go  I'm talking  about  it's like  I don't  know why  even ironed  my shirt  to come  out here  I don't  remember half  the stuff  I said  it was  total  I've watched  it like  ten times  already  it is  all good  and it  is all  brutal  it's just  fantastic  I've never  ever seen  a set  like that  I've never  seen anyone  handle  a stupid  heckler  in a club  is one  thing  you got  ten thousand  people  and you  just  trashed them 
[01:31:00]  to the point  where they  loved you  when you  left  hey what's  going on  this is  Bill Burr  you're  listening to  the worst  of Opie  and Anthony  it's the  best  of the  worst  of the  comics  on the  Opie  and Anthony  show  Opie  and Anthony  oh hey you  well guess  who's back  it's the  best  of the  worst  of the  comics  on the  Opie  and Anthony  show  hey  this is  Nick  to follow  and this  is the  worst  of Robert

[01:41:30]  fucking ridiculous  that's just  it's like he just  it's like he just  shoved raw chopped meat  on his head  he's actually  the thing that makes  the chopped meat  as it's coming out  the grinder  grinder  oh that's  the whole sandwich  just comes out  the way it went in  or not  time for break  time for  oh god  it's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the O.B. and Anthony show  it's the best 
[01:42:00]  the best  of the worst  of the comedians  of the O.B. and Anthony show  just hilarious  I'm sorry  yeah  really funny  really awful too  by the way  I'll acknowledge that  holy mother of god  now presenting  comedian  Joe Rogan  Rogan  Joe Rogan  what's up  what's happening man  I'm sorry I'm late  but I had a  what's up dude  I wrote a tirade 
[01:42:30]  about Carlos Muncie  on my website  this morning  I was reading that  I stayed up all night  I stayed up all night  I got to my hotel room  at like  I don't know  like 5 o'clock  in the morning  and I was like  shit let me just  sleep for like an hour  and I'm like  fuck I gotta write this  so I sat down  at like 5 o'clock  in the morning  I had a Red Bull  this was like number 3  you wrote that this morning  pot lollipop  wait what is that lollipop  it's a pot lollipop  pot lollipop  are you kidding  no no I'm not kidding  does it get you fucked up  fuck yeah  yeah dude  if you don't smoke pot 
[01:43:00]  this will put you  on fucking Pluto  you'll be like  pinned to Pluto  spinning around in space  this is gonna be  the best show of the week  it is 7-17  and I am guaranteeing  this is the best  radio show of the week  this is why  this is why I stayed up  I got an email  the other day  from this guy  in Tucson  clear the phone lines  Joe Rogan's got some shit  to get off his  alright so this is what happened  I get this email  the other day  from this guy  who's a radio DJ  in Tucson  who says that  Carlos Mancia  was talking shit  about me on the radio 
[01:43:30]  do I want to listen to it  I say okay  so he sends me  the audio file  and it's Carlos  basically saying  that he came  to the comedy store  and that he went  on after me  and that everyone  in the comedy store  calls him the punisher  like he's completely  out of his fucking mind  and that the only reason  why everybody says  he steals jokes  is because  they're jealous  which is insane  because have you ever  heard anybody saying  that Chris Rock  steals jokes  or Dave Chappelle  steals jokes  no but they're more  jealous of Carlos 
[01:44:00]  Mancia  than Chris Rock  alright  here's the problem  with this guy  he lives in such  a shallow glass house  Carlos Mancia  claims to be Mexican  his name isn't even  really Carlos Mancia  that's a fake name  his real ethnicity  is he's half German  and half Honduran  and his real name  is Ned Wholeness  this is real  this is all real  I didn't know that  invented the name  Carlos Mancia  to ingratiate him  with the Latino  community of Los Angeles  so this fucking retard 
[01:44:30]  his name is Ned  yeah his name is Ned  yeah  he's got a fake name  I mean this guy  is so fucking stupid  his whole reason  his whole reasoning  for why people  call him a thief  is that they're jealous  they're jealous of him  this fake fucking Mexican  living this fake life  stealing people's material  alright so  what he says  is basically  I got the audio  by the way  if you want to go through it  what him on stage  no  oh of the show  yeah  oh that's beautiful  you want to do that 
[01:45:00]  or what  it sure collects  we can  sure we can go on  but what's even better  is what I did  is I put the audio  on my website  and I have a  I hired a personal  cameraman  so my cameraman  happened to be there  the day Carlos  claims that I was  watching him  from the stage  and instead  what we have  is me on stage  and him watching me  pacing around the room  watching me  the guy imitates everyone  including me  all the time  he steals from everyone  whether it's  George Lopez  or Paul Mooney  or old Richard Pryor albums 
[01:45:30]  the guy's a fucking idiot  and all he does  is rehash  other people's shit  or rewrite  other people's shit  you know  you do a joke about  going to the fucking zoo  whatever it is  and if it kills  he'll do a joke  about going to the zoo  and just rewrite your shit  he's a weak minded  fucking simpleton  and he doesn't know  that people know  he's a weak minded simpleton  wouldn't it be great  to be able to  hear this shit  and then go like  fucking Rogan  I'm going to kick his ass  but Rogan's  such a fucking animal  you can't kick his ass 
[01:46:00]  well I mean  why would you want to  kick my ass  because I'm telling the truth  that's the crazy thing  I'm not running around  saying that great comedians  are shitheads  I love comedy  and there's the whole point  the thing that I wrote  on my website  JoeRogan.net  the whole thing I wrote  this morning  at 5 o'clock in the morning  with no sleep  is that I'm a huge fan  of comedy  to this day  still am  always will be  you know  if I'm at the comedy store  and Chris Rock shows up  dude  I'm the first person  who wants to sit down  I want to watch  great comedy  I love it  I love somebody  who's got a unique 
[01:46:30]  point of view  I love somebody  who comes up  with some new shit  that they crafted  I know this guy  sat down on his computer  and wrote this all out  and tried it on stage  in 15 different comedy clubs  and then boom  there it is  you're like  whoa  like I remember  when Rock was at  the comedy store  he was working out  his Oscar shit  dude  like me  and like 10 other guys  sat in the back of the room  fucking howling  loving it  love comedy  hate fucking thieves  that's all it is  I hate fucking thieves  does it fucking infuriate you  I know the kind 
[01:47:00]  I don't know  Ned  just call him  the phony Mexican  or Carlos Menstilia  that's what we call him  what he's talking about  like  the most brutal thief  isn't the guy  who just  takes your whole joke  it's almost like  mad libs  like they'll just  say he's saying  you go to the zoo  and you got a bit  about a gorilla  he makes it an orangutan  you know what I mean  exactly  he was taking a shit  he was taking a dump  Dane Cook did that to me  he did it on premium blend  he did my joke about fucking tigers  he did it with rhinos 
[01:47:30]  genius  fucking genius  you know there's so much of that shit going on  it's fucking insane  it happens in radio all the time too  of course it does  but the new thing in radio is like  everyone steals from everyone so it's okay  that it is  you know I love when you guys do something  you credit people  that's the way to do it  and that other douchebag  that was you know  doing your shit on channel 152  that you guys were torturing  for a few days  oh Jim Phillips  yeah that fucking idiot  that was one wasn't it  that was one of the last shows 
[01:48:00]  I listened to before I got a new car  and I have to get an XM  in my new car  Joe you ever have somebody  come up to you right  you just did your set  you killed  some bitch just killed  and somebody comes up to you  and is like  yeah you know  I used to do some shit like that  and you know they're lying  oh yeah  yeah I used to do a bit like that  but it's a little different  you don't have to worry about it  you can still do it  oh thank you  they give you permission  to do it wrong  weak minded cocksucker  you know the best one I ever got  I had a guy actually say  you know what  I was thinking of doing some shit like that  oh that's funny  it's just like  what after I said it 
[01:48:30]  and then  coincidentally  they bring back their old material  that they never did  in the first place  because they now set it up  by saying that  they used to do that material  yeah  that's wonderful  and what's really brutal  is comedy clubs  don't do anything about it man  I mean it's just  the most frustrating thing  in the world  for a comic to know that  your art  what you do  what you put out  is supporting this club  keeping it together  but these people like  fucking cannibals  and they hire  these scumbags  these fucking thieves  these just fucking 
[01:49:00]  simpleton cocksuckers  who can't come up with anything  these weak minded  motherfuckers  who just  just rehash your shit  and these comedy clubs  hire them  and they expect you  to all work it out  they expect  I've actually heard that argument  hey you guys gotta work that out  with yourself  you fucking  no  he's a thief  you fucking know  no one calls someone  a thief  that's not a thief  there's not one person  I've ever heard  called a thief  that's not a thief  have you  have you ever heard  one person  called a thief  that's not a thief 
[01:49:30]  it doesn't exist  there's thieves  and there's regular comedians  but those thieves  they fucking make it through  they sneak through the net  somehow or another  because the comics  don't do anything about it  because the club owners  don't do anything about it  these motherfuckers  they swim upstream  and they make it  and they have millions of dollars  and they're driving  fucking fancy cars  and everybody goes  well you're just fucking jealous  and you're just sitting there  going holy shit  holy shit  is this for real  is this for real  I guess in comedy  it's just completely accepted  it's not  these people are fucking pussies 
[01:50:00]  they're afraid  they're afraid of conflict  they're afraid of standing up  it's less accepted in comedy  than radio  definitely  because these guys  are always bitching  behind the scenes  yeah but they're bitching  behind the scenes  but then like you said  the comedy clubs  don't do anything  the comedy clubs  the comic is probably  the last priority  in the comedy club  like it's just  get someone in there  that's going to make  these people fucking pay  and that's pretty much  their priority  they don't care about  the comics  so they're fucking  like they're supposed  to be some kind of ethics  or some kind of  you know  you guys are supposed 
[01:50:30]  to work things out  how many asses  are in the seats  how many asses  are you putting  in those seats  that's it  how many asses  are in the seats  well let's play this audio  because now everyone  is very interested  in what Carlos  Mancia had to say  and you can go  to my website  it's all up  along with the video  that my cameraman got  of Carlos  watching me  in the back of the room  all that shit  and if you ask nicely  he'll tell you  how to get the pot  lollipops  you gotta get a  prescription  a prescription  yeah I have a prescription  for medical marijuana  are you shitting me  they are prescription  lollipops  I went to a doctor 
[01:51:00]  I said I have headaches  he said when  do you have headaches  I said whenever  I think about the fact  that pot's illegal  and they just fucking  write you out  a piece of paper  and you go to  a cannabis club  and you can buy weed  a cannabis club  dude I have pot soda  I have pot lollipops  if you just  were locked in my house  you could get high  for six months  you would never  have to leave  weird I've never  seen those at a  pharmacy though  no they don't  exist at pharmacies  how do you get  a prescription  when you take  a prescription  to a dealer  I'm gonna be  there's 
[01:51:30]  there's  fuck I forgot  where it's playing  shit  it's on my laptop  there's  the Stoney Awards  are in New York City  Wednesday night  and  Fear Factor won  for best  it's a high times  the high times  awards  Fear Factor won  for best reality show  and I won  for best reality show  host  and so  go there  wherever the fuck  it is  and people  show you  how to do it  I wasn't able  to watch  Fear Factor  for the longest time  because I can't  fucking stomach  the people  eating shit  but for some  reason now 
[01:52:00]  I've broken  through  I don't know  what happened  there was  like nothing  on  I'm flipping  around  I see Rogan  I'm like  alright  and it wasn't  an eating thing  it was like  they're fucking  dangling from a  chopper waiting  for their leg  to fall off  or something  and Rogan's  laughing at them  and I'm watching  and I kind of  get into it  I get caught up  and they get to  the fucking  maggot eating  portion  and now I'm  involved  in these people  in the competition  so I can't  just tune away  because now I saw  who won the  fucking dangling 
[01:52:30]  from the helicopter  thing  and now  I've broken  through  and I can  watch this  and Joe  is just  as disgusted  as I am  watching this shit  I don't know  if he is though  he is so  disgusted  I've seen him  skeeve out  at this shit  I don't act  it's not  the eating stuff  definitely  disturbs him  it smells so bad  and it's all real  they're all just  really gagging  they have mouthfuls  of maggots  they're eating  horse assholes  yeah and I'm like  you can do it  hang in there  shove it in your mouth  come on 
[01:53:00]  you're almost there  and they're eating  horse assholes  big round meat donuts  of horse ass  you gotta eat  and you're not lying  you're not lying  eight more  eight more  you can do it  you got 20 seconds  come on  yeah  oh they're gagging  and I can't even believe  it's a fucking job  I know  I show up for work  every day going  really  really  they haven't caught  on to this yet  alright one more  are you amazed  how long the show's  been on now  I thought it was  going to be cancelled  immediately  it seemed like  it would be like  maybe an eight 
[01:53:30]  week run  or something like that  it's been on for years now  six seasons  and I thought  when they  six seasons  season six  I thought when they  brought the fucking  kids on  and I swear to you  that it was a joke  I thought  I had switched  maybe mad TV  or something  and I thought  it was a joke  because I said  there is no way  they are going  to allow children  to dangle  from helicopters  to fucking  fall in the ocean  to eat fucking  maggots 
[01:54:00]  and there they are  actual  little  children  with Rogan  just the cheerleader  there  come on kids  we're gonna run you  through a combine  and then have you  spit out the other side  the crazy thing  is it's a huge  show with kids  it's a really big  show with families  because there's no  nudity and there's  no violence  which is rare  on television  so the whole family  can sit around  and watch everybody  gag on animal  I saw one  where these little  kids had to  jump  they're being  towed by these 
[01:54:30]  boats  there's three of  these little  round rafts  and they had to  jump from one  to the other  and give the  father a flag  and then the  father had to  jump back  and put the  flag back again  well this one  kid does  a perfect job  he's hanging  on to the  edge  the father  gets the  flag  he hits  the kid  and knocks  him clean  off the  fucking raft  so he can  win  so he can  just  throw his  kid into  the water  the boats  doing like  40  kid's gone  I'm howling 
[01:55:00]  how is this  even allowed  you and me  both  me sitting  on the dock  going  whoa  for real  and then  the chicks  they get  on there  yeah are  you banging  those chicks  way too  many problems  with that  I would gather  that would be  the wrong  thing to do  yeah I would  guess that  would be a  bad thing  to do  you can  look though  you can  gawk  and they  don't have  enough shots  to cut away  from you  not gawking 
[01:55:30]  sometimes  gawk openly  fuck it  everybody knows  I'm a pervert  good  film me  you're going  over the reaction  shot of some  guy just going  by in a boat  because they  don't have  any footage  of him not  looking at  our tits  someone wants  to know  if you ever  threw up  there  yeah I  threw up  once at  home actually  I never  thrown up  on the set  one time  during the  first season  there was  this chick  who was  drinking  a mouthful  of worms  she was  a glassful  of worms  and she  got him  in her mouth 
[01:56:00]  and she  tried to  swallow  and she  like violent  like a cat  like a cat  like you know  when a cat  just pukes  up the hair  violent  noise  and she  couldn't  touch it  with her  hands  so she's  like scooping  it up  with the glass  and she  gets it  back in her  mouth  and her  hand is  fucking  shaking  and she's  sweating  and tears  are coming  out of her  mouth  and she's  gagging  I'm at  home  I just  put my  finger over  my mouth  it's running  down my  hand  I ran  into the  sink  just chuck 
[01:56:30]  my burrito  all over  the sink  my girlfriend  is laughing  her fucking  ass off  she was  just crying  laughing  one of the  worst things  Joe comes  how was your  day at work  oh they had  this  well it was  on television  watching it  live  didn't do it  to me  but watching  it on television  with the  close ups  and the music  like every  time  they're like  gagging  the music  like no  the worst  is when those  maggots are put  in the fucking 
[01:57:00]  blender  and pureed  into this  white nastiness  this yellow  pus like  consistency  with just  maggot shell  all mixed  in  and they  have to  drink  the smell  yeah  I would  rather do  that than  actually have  them alive  in my mouth  really  rolling around  I've never  seen the  maggot  oh when I  have to  transfer it  from one  thing to  another  oh that's  nothing  the big  mouthful  mouthfuls  are nothing  because you  spit it out  you hold  it and you  spit it out  it's the  swallowing  that's the 
[01:57:30]  hard part  and then  the meat  byproducts  that you  guys come  up with  with the  horse's ass  and the  other thing  can't do  horse anymore  can't do  horse anymore  why is that  too many people  complained  too many horse  lovers  complained  oh my god  peter  no horse  lovers  well peter must  just hate the  show anyway  you know what  was really funny  very ironic  was wendy's  was a big  complainer  they complained  and they  suggested that  we never do  that again  meanwhile  they kill  like a fucking  hundred million  cows  isn't that  insane  like don't  don't kill 
[01:58:00]  horses  we don't even  kill them  people eat  horses  it's a common  and a lot of  the horses  used for other  things  and I'm sure  the stuff  that you're  using for them  to eat  is supposed to  be used for  other stuff  I don't know  man  wasn't that an  episode  all in the  family  wasn't that  all in the  family  he served  Archie  some horse  and it was  cheaper than  steak  and he enjoyed  it  and it was  all meathead  making horse  jokes as he  was eating  it  alright should  we play the  audio 
[01:58:30]  sure  let's expose  this motherfucker  well I want to  hear what this  is all about  carl smith see  on the frank  show in  Arizona  there  so what were  you going to  ask me  that you got  interested in  we were talking  about your  website and you  said there's like  hate mail and  stuff on there  oh I get  great hate  mail  what's it  about in  regards to  what  great hate  mail  well I got  a flood  recently  because somebody  went on  joe rogan's  website and  asked him about  me and then  he said that  the force was  weak with me  basically saying

[02:01:30]  and he's  a joke  thief  there's  nothing  genuine  about him  and yet  this dumb  motherfucker  thinks he's  going to get  on the air  in Tucson  and I'm  not going  to hear  about it  but thank  god  this guy  Frank  emails me  and sends  me  kudos  to that  guy  that guy  that's  a fucking  nice move  alright let's  go to the  next clip  here  so  no but  I'm tired  of it  dude  because I've  been nice  to that guy  all the time  and that dude  you know  what happens  is we go  to the comedy  store  right  where I  haven't been  in years  and everybody  walks around  saying Joe  Rogan is 
[02:02:00]  the man  right  but they're  saying that  because they  haven't seen  me  right  so then I  go in there  and I show  them what  can be done  and they walk  around and go  oh my god  everything I heard  about Carlos  is right  that guy  is sick  nope  I mean  I'll walk  into the  comedy store  dude  after  legends walk  in there  right  at like  one o'clock  in the morning  in front of  twelve drunk  people  sure  and I'll get  a standing  ovation  right  because I  love that  place  I mean  it just  dude  it just  oh  and then all 
[02:02:30]  the comics  walk  that's where  I got  the nickname  the Punisher  I got the nickname  the Punisher  because  who was in  there  oh yeah  oh yeah  let me make  this up  real quick  oh yeah  first of all  nobody calls  that guy  the Punisher  so they call  him the  phony Mexican  or they call  him Carlos  Menstelia  that's all  anybody calls  him  if you go  to the  comedy store  that's what  you hear  oh dude  the phony  Mexican's  here  or Carlos  Menstelia's  here  and what  happens  everybody gets  nervous  because Carlos  sits in the  back of the room  with a fucking  tape recorder  and watches  people's sets  I had never 
[02:03:00]  heard of the  Punisher  oh yeah  Chris Rock  was on stage  and I was  with some  buddies  and they  were like  man  Chris Rock  is unbelievable  they're all  like cream  in their pants  over Chris Rock  yeah  and I went  he's great  he's awesome  and I disappeared  and I told the guys  I want to go on  after Chris  so I went on  after Chris  and I just  destroyed the room  and then  from that point  on all the  comics were like  that's the guy  that's the guy  man  he's the one  the Punisher  right there  that is so 
[02:03:30]  fucking insane  if you knew  the atmosphere  of the comedy store  and how much  that guy  is loathed  this would be  hysterical  when he shows up  everybody goes  that's what  everybody goes  this motherfucker  and a few guys  like they'll  open for him  on the road  every now and then  it's like  hey Carlos  what's up  you know  they just want  that $120  check every now  and then  you know  thinking how much  Raymond Pride  fucking noodles  they can buy  with it  that's it  that's the only  people that talk  to him  oh man  oh I get  he steals 
[02:04:00]  other comics  material  that we've  heard a lot  yes  put these rumors  to rest  we get comics  that come in here  and make those  comments before  but they make them  because they  can't explain  why I'm funnier  than them  right right right  so whoever said  that  was that part  of Joe Rogan  stick with you  though  that  yes  didn't Joe  out there  on Howard Stern  and all that  hold on  right real quick  I think that  first of all  I outed  Dennis Leary  in Playboy  magazine  and then  I didn't even  bring it up  we talked about that  someone called it up  when I was on Howard 
[02:04:30]  someone called in  and they brought it up  and I said  okay here's  here's what happened  and I always tell  everybody that I was  a Dennis Leary fan  when I first started out  doing comedy  in Boston  I remember  the first time  I saw Leary  I was like  holy shit  this guy's  fucking awesome  this guy's  really funny  and then I saw  Hicks  and I was like  okay what the fuck's  going on  these guys are doing  the same shit  and then I talked  to all the comics  in Boston  all the old school  comics  and they all said  Leary's a thief  and I was like  whoa  I was like  well why are they  hiring him  well that's just  the way it goes  I was like  holy shit  holy shit 
[02:05:00]  and you know what  no one ever wanted  to listen to someone  who nobody knew  who the guy was  you know when I was  on news radio  and if I was running  around yelling  Dennis Leary's a thief  I'd be like  fuck you  who the fuck are you  you know  and then finally  you know like  people knew who I was  and they asked me  when I did this  Playboy magazine interview  you know what do you hate  about comedy  what bothers me  I'll tell you what  I hate  I hate fucking joke thieves  do you want to name  joke thieves  I said  fuck it  yeah  this is  these are the people  that steal  and I started going off  about Dennis Leary  about how much  it bothered me 
[02:05:30]  and how much  it freaked me out  that this guy  could just  take somebody's ideas  and rework them  and make a career  out of it  it's fucking crazy  Dennis Leary's first album  was so similar  to the Bill Hicks stuff  it was scary  it was scary  but then you look at  Locked and Loaded  the last one that he did  after Bill died  and it's a fucking  steaming pile of shit  it's awful  because that's  Dennis's real thoughts  that's his real  creative material  that's his real shit  Leary on Howard Stern  and all that  I think that  I think that's what happened  see 
[02:06:00]  those guys want to  put me down  because they got  nothing  they got nothing on me  yeah  they got nothing on me  so then they just  throw that out there  see here's how  I can prove it to you  I mean  to anybody  I don't have the time  to steal other people's material  if I wanted  what the fuck does that mean  what the fuck does  I don't have the time  to steal material  but what  you have the time  to write material  you fucking asshole  what does that even mean  you don't  I don't have the time  to steal material  that is the  the most insane  defense I've ever heard  in my life  I don't have the time 
[02:06:30]  to steal material  whoa  whoa  but yet you're sitting  in the back of the fucking room  every time I'm on stage  watching me  my whole fucking set  and I got it on videotape  you cocksucker  and it's on  JoeRogan.net  and anybody can watch  anybody can watch  you watching me  and me watching you  bomb  for about 30 seconds  and leaving the room  get that up there  I want to see this now  you can watch it  my cameraman  made a whole video  made a whole video  because  keep playing  I'll explain the whole thing 
[02:07:00]  buddy  I don't have the time  to steal other people's material  if I wanted to  right right  let's just theoretically say  that I wanted to steal  other people's material  the past 10 years  I've been doing the road  50 weeks a year  right  50 weeks a year  so you don't have time  I couldn't be in two places  at the same time  if I wanted to steal your act  I couldn't  pause that for a second  I did a one man show  in Aspen  and this is when I hated  this motherfucker  and we had words  at the comedy store  and he knew I hated him  and yet  he came in  while I was standing there  waiting to go on stage 
[02:07:30]  in Aspen at the comedy festival  he came into the room  and sat down  and watched my entire  fucking set  he knew I hated him  he knew that he hated me  and yet he came there  and he watched  like he does with everybody  he sits and he watches  and he just cherry picks  just cherry picks ideas  how can I rework that  how can I fit that  into my beaner material  how can I fit that  into this  that's what he does  I wanted to steal your act  I couldn't  so why are guys like jokes  and secondly  they can't do my jokes 
[02:08:00]  so why are they saying that  oh those jokes are so  fucking hard to do  fuck  black people  fuck  white people  fuck  what's up white people  come on  take a joke  fuck  those jokes are so  fucking hard to do  you fucking craftsmen  you god damn  fucking genius  would you compare  white people to Mexicans  that is insane  how do you do that  how do you rework  Paul Mooney's material  take out the word nigger  and put in Mexican  that is fucking genius 
[02:08:30]  where do you come up  with these thoughts  are you taking DMT  are you lying in an  isolation tank  are you tripping on mushrooms  where are you getting  this creative burst  of fucking genius  please  tell us  oh punisher  please  tell us  hey you fucked up  asshole  you talked about me  on the radio  you gave me  it's open season  on phony Mexicans  you fucking piece of shit  sorry  carry on  that's the pot  lollipop talk  how many more Red Bulls 
[02:09:00]  are you going to have  this morning  that's all I need to know  I don't need one dude  that lollipop's  filled with hate  shit too  yeah  the lollipop's  almost gone  you know what  this is 10 years  of this kind of hate  man  I've watched this guy  for 10 years  do this shit  10 years  steal from everybody  man  so why are they  saying that  why are they  making these comics  because that's the only  way they feel better  about themselves  that's the only way  they can explain  why I do better  than them  why aren't they  saying it about  other comics though  why are you  because those other  comics aren't that funny  oh Chris Rock 
[02:09:30]  that guy's not that funny  that Dave Chappelle  guy that guy  fucking sucks  Dave Attell  what the fuck  is that guy funny  come on  Jim Norton  who the fuck  is that guy funny  Bill comment  step up  I live out here man  step up  I've never seen  the dude  it's that east coast  west coast thing  no it's one of those  things  everything he's saying  I've heard  time and time again  but you know  I heard the same shit  Robin Williams  they always say that 
[02:10:00]  shit about him  but it's like  I never seen it  you know what  the real problem is  yeah they say  Robin Williams  is a huge thief  I'm sure he is  everybody that I know  that have ever seen him  back in the day  said he was a thief  Steve Pearl  who's a guy  who was at the comedy  store all the time  said Robin stole  a bunch of his shit  and had to give him  checks for it  but you know what  none of Robin's peers  ever stepped up  none of Robin's  you know  none of those guys  that were like  big comics back then  ever got on the radio  and say this guy's  a piece of shit  you know  no one ever published  an article in a magazine  nobody ever stepped up  or wrote a book about it  nobody ever put an article 
[02:10:30]  on their webpage  nobody ever stopped it  nobody ever  nobody who had the power  to stop it  ever stood up  because they don't  want to distract  from their own career  they don't want to  you know focus on  you know the possibility  they might be jealous  of this person  they want to just  you know do their own shit  and just try to  hope he doesn't  steal from them  you know like  Jay Leno said  oh just write faster  and they can fucking steal  write faster  how about kill them  and bury them  in the fucking woods  write faster  and they can steal  I'm five minutes away  from doing  it's impossible  the rest of the show  as loud as him 
[02:11:00]  I'm sorry  fucking Joe Rogan  dude  I'm loving the energy  come on  let's go  fucking mad  because  it's happened to me  a bunch of times  and you  you write something  and Billy  you can back me up on this  you know what it's like  you get a bit  and you  yes I do  Bill Burr  doesn't have a network show yet  so  you know  you come up with an idea  you tweak it  you find the right way  to do it  I don't  you know what I mean  I can't 
[02:11:30]  but it's not even him  I'm talking about  joke thieves in general  there is a West Coast  East Coast comedy thing  going on  there's no joke thieves  on the East Coast  right  no I'm just saying  that you know  I would trash a guy  if the dude  stole one of my jokes  I saw him do it  I definitely knew it  I've heard all this shit  about Carlos  but you know  my whole career  has been out here  I don't even get half  I didn't know  what a fucking beaner was  that's like  when he's like  I know what you're thinking  they finally gave a beaner  a show  and my girl  looked over at me  she goes  what's a beaner 
[02:12:00]  that's my only thing  about him  he does his act  like everybody grew up  right outside of San Diego  alright we got two more clips here  they're short  it's true  you're right actually Frank  it was Joe Rogan  to Dennis Leary  and Dennis Leary  actually came out  and called him out on it  and Joe just cowered  why is Joe  hysterical  you didn't cower  by the way  I was following that whole thing  there was no cowering  from Dennis Leary  was he going to cough on me  what the fuck's going to happen  that's an easy one  you could just get all the CDs  and see which one was done first 
[02:12:30]  there was no cowering  you know what man  I came out  you get Bill Hicks  Relentless  and then get Dennis Leary's  first album  and you'll see  and I'm aware of this  yeah  and I'm aware of this  really intimately  because the producer  of all of Bill's albums  is Bill's best friend  Kevin Booth  who's a really good friend of mine  so I got straight information  right from Kevin  who told me exactly  what Bill was going through  how Bill was freaking out  about how Bill  and Dennis were friends  in the clubs  and he couldn't fucking believe  that Dennis was doing his shit  and Dennis was doing shit  that he did on an album 
[02:13:00]  and he's doing his  no cure for cancer thing  he's like  this is insane  like how do I stop this  was it just accepted back then  no man  just nobody did anything  nobody stepped up  and said hey fuck you  you know nobody stepped up  nobody stepped up  that's what it is  once you get to the point  if you're putting  you know asses in the seats  they don't care  so it's up to you guys  to kind of like  police the thing  club owners don't give a fuck  but what about you guys  policing the thing  making it uncomfortable  that's what I'm doing right now  that's what I'm doing right now  take him to the octagon  that's what we're doing right now  take him to the octagon Joe 
[02:13:30]  we're making the phony Mexican  uncomfortable  right now  and I want everyone to know  UFC rules  come on  kick some ass  you need a lot more  you know your fellow  comedians to step up  well you know  absolutely  you guys gotta police your own  you know what  he fucked up  because if he wasn't  talking shit about me  I wouldn't be talking  about him right now  we wouldn't be talking  about whatever  well because we've gone  after a bunch of radio  shows recently  and their excuse was  ah everyone steals  so it's okay  and we're finally saying  no it's not okay  it's just not okay  it's not  I heard Chuck Lydell 
[02:14:00]  ripping you off  what are you gonna do  I'm gonna hide  cover my body  and curl up in the fetal position  hoping he gets tired of punching me  that animal  but if Gilbert Godfrey  ripped you off  that would be no problem  right  that would be a different story  clearly  Joe's a tough motherfucker man  he actually came out  and called him out on it  yeah  and Joe just cowered  why is Joe  all of a sudden  determined that  he's the arbiter of comedy  and he's gonna put  everybody in check  what's up with Joe 
[02:14:30]  because he  I don't know man  it's insecurities  it's like look  when I go on stage  okay this weekend  for example  I'm going on stage  with 11 other comics  okay  we're doing 12,000 seats  in LA  20,000 seats  in San Jose, California  right  alright  so we're doing  this huge venue  I'm telling you right now  that from a competitive  standpoint  I wanna be  the funniest guy  on that stage  I wanna kick  everybody's ass  it's just like  everybody in radio  that does morning radio  they wanna be  the funniest show  the most popular show 
[02:15:00]  sure  but at the end  of the night  that doesn't matter  yeah you're right  because it's all about  putting the effort forth  I think the force  is with you Carlos  don't listen to that  Joe Rogan  wow that guy's  really funny  the guy at the end  there was really funny  I like that line  he did  well  probably got a big laugh  in Arizona  so  what  let's keep going  with the clip  because at the end  of it  this is the last clip  you wanna hear  the greatest story  here's the greatest 
[02:15:30]  run up story  to that  Joe was on stage  two Fridays ago  and then I went on  after him  and he got off stage  and he was just like  watching me  pacing  and I could see him  like look in the  back of the room  and then I'd get  a huge laugh  and he'd walk out  then he'd come back  and get a huge laugh  then he'd walk out  and then I got off stage  and I left  and the next day  I got a phone call  from some of the comedians  and they're like  dude  we don't know  if we fixed it  but we made him  we made him  we made him admit it 
[02:16:00]  and then  listen to how  how full of shit  that sounds  I mean  if you're someone  who knows how to read  people when they're  lying and making  things up  just replay  just that  we made him  admit it  listen to this  alright hold on  I gotta do a little  something here  but we made him  we made him  we made him admit it  what the fuck  are you talking about  you're a psychologist too  I love it  they made him admit it  they made him admit it  admit what  admit what  yeah well he'll play it again 
[02:16:30]  oh I will  no I mean  he'll say it again  he'll say what it is  they're like  dude  we don't know  if we fixed it  but we made him  we made him  we made him admit it  and then  made him admit what  so here's what they did  they sat  he was talking smack  about me  and they said  dude  you can say  whatever you want  about him  but you know what  he doesn't steal  people's material  he's great  and you know what  he kills  and you have to admit that  you can say you hate him  you can say you don't like him  but you have to admit  that he kills  and he was like  I will not admit that 
[02:17:00]  and they're like  you have to dude  you have to admit  that he kills  and they're like  we talked to him  for an hour  and at the end of an hour  he finally said  alright I admit it  alright  so he said  and they quote that  he said  fine he kills  I don't know how he does it  I can't explain it  but he kills  and then they all  just walked away  and I was like  yes  I am the  punisher  and then I whacked off  oh  the comedy god 
[02:17:30]  shined upon thee  that's why it gets  a standing ovation  now here's the beautiful  did you hear the hole  Anthony  yeah the hole  added in her  the hole  every morning show  has to have a hole  that has absolutely  nothing  but here's the beautiful  thing about it  what he's describing  I actually have  a cameraman  that follows me around  at the comedy store  because a bunch of my  buddies come to the  comedy store  and a lot of times  we're hanging out  in the park  unless some really 
[02:18:00]  funny shit happens  and we videotape it  and I edit it  and I put it on the internet  yeah  well my camera guy  was there  for this night  and he videotaped  Carlos watching me  okay  from the back  of the room  doing exactly  what he claims  I was doing  pacing around the room  watching me  from a bunch  of different angles  and then he also  videotaped me  afterwards going  dude  I just don't  what the  he's talking about  nothing  he's just saying  nothing  he's a fucking idiot  saying that  for one minute  that's how I talked  about him 
[02:18:30]  for one minute  that's it  that was the whole thing  we got all of it  on videotape  all of it  including  this audio  so we have his audio  over the reality  and my camera guy  edited it all together  with a Mexican song  and it's beautiful  what's up  this is Joe Rogan  and you are listening  to the worst  of Opie and Anthony  it's the best  of the worst  of the comics  on the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  the virus is an XL channel 
[02:19:00]  which may contain  explicit language  channel blocking  is available  by calling  1-800-XM-RADIO  or in XM-Canada  877-438-9677  it's the best  the best  of the worst  of the comedians  of the Opie and Anthony show  just hilarious  I'm sorry  yeah  really funny  really awful too  by the way  I'll acknowledge that  holy mother of god  now presenting  comedian  Carlos Mencia 
[02:19:30]  you guys want to  get the Punisher  in here  is he making them  we're ready for the Punisher  they're chit chatting  the comics out there  well Susie Espin  said Carlos Mencia  is here  you comics  you comics are all like  you'll know each other  somehow  you work together  somewhere  there's never one comic  that meets another  that doesn't know him  or hasn't worked  somewhere with him  back 20 years ago  I never met her before  I just like knew her 
[02:20:00]  from Curb  so I was like  wow  that's awesome  it's called  it's called  comic rotary  is that what it is  that's Gary Hoey  what's up buddy  good morning  how are you  pleasure to meet you man  we're gonna do  something a little  different today  we're gonna have  Carlos Mencia  play the guitar  and Gary Hoey's  gonna tell jokes  I'm gonna do stand up  man  can we do that  no I think I'll  stay sitting down  you can only play  those big fat guitars  I'm the only beaner  that doesn't know  how to play a guitar  dude  I'm the only one  in the history of me  I don't know 
[02:20:30]  how to play a guitar  I can play the accordion  though  which is even gayer  how do you pick up  the accordion  and why  well cause like  you know  my mom growing up  used to listen to  that stupid ass  wetback music  and my dad  got an accordion  so he got my sister  to actually  accordions are big  learn how to play it  in the Spanish community  wait if we can find  an accordion right now  you'd be able to play it  no dude  I refuse to do that  come on  I'll tell you that I can  but I ain't gonna do it 
[02:21:00]  that's even gayer  dude  come on now  we're afraid about our show  you would never find  an accordion  someone get us  accordion  pronto  you want  I wanna see  Carlos don't worry  they can't get an accordion  Jen from Seattle  had to send a new bullhorn  so there's no way  they're gonna get an accordion  we're not gonna get an accordion  and is it  is it like  you'd be surprised  cause I'm thinking  polka music  is all I know  about accordion  but I would think  that Spanish  you'd never heard  go to like  authentic mexican music dot com  go there 
[02:21:30]  and I'm telling you  they all have that  I swear to god  I don't know what it is  the guy with that  big wide guitar  that's all I ever see  the mariachi  yeah but that's the mariachi guys  yeah  the guys that  wear the pants  are tapered all the way  and they're really tight  from top to bottom  why does the guitar  have to be so thick  why do they have to be so fat  they interrupt you  while you're trying to eat  come up to your table  and stop playing  it's like  you were okay  like 20 feet away  I liked you  when you were at that table  over there  right now 
[02:22:00]  it's not a marching band  stay still  stay away from the diners  then you gotta nod awkwardly  like  good job  thank you  that's not the worst  the worst is that  if you actually know the music  it's annoying  because they try to play  the artistic  their own version  of the song  so just imagine  you know what I mean  a lounge singer  and you're like  oh man  I wanna hear whatever song  and they play it  like with their version of it  it is so fucking annoying  because you wanna sing along 
[02:22:30]  you know what I'm saying  so you go play more than a feeling  oh I know that song  you know what I mean  and they're like  instead of more than a feeling  they're like  more than a feeling  and you're like  dude  that's not how the song goes  you know  it's unbelievable  I would think  if I was requesting it  to a mariachi band  that he probably wouldn't know  how it goes though  no but I'm saying  comparing  like the Spanish version  sometimes they'll play  English songs too  like they're getting into that  they're trying to cross over  so when you go  like I did this  mariachi festival 
[02:23:00]  and this one  group of mariachis  was actually playing  like Led Zeppelin  and Beatles songs  really  yes  well  were they doing it well  or  it was funny  yeah it was funny  entertaining  it was very entertaining  well who didn't like  Jose Feliciano's version  of Light My Fire  ah of course  he Spanished that one up a bit  do we have that  and he actually got away with it  we have a little taste of that  everyone liked it  right up until the  Light My Fire  Light My Fire  and that was like  ok  alright  you were doing a good job  I was getting into 
[02:23:30]  the whole groove of it  sounded cool  and it went off  with the  Tourette's version  alright now we gotta  find the damn thing  hold on  oh you gonna be able  to find it Hawk  of course  Hawk's at the helm  there it is  right  I don't hear Light My Fire  yet  I'll have the  burrito and taco combo  this song  was huge  back in like  the 70's  is it cause the song's  good or cause he's blind  I think it's blind 
[02:24:00]  Spanish  do you know what I'm saying  it was a Doors song  it was after Chico  and the man  where he had some popularity  yeah  you know that  I would be  a liar  did do a good job  of it  it's pretty good  yeah  I mean it's  it's  no Gary Hoey  so I'm doing it live  on Flip Wilson  I think  right after the  here come to judge skin  but see what I mean 
[02:24:30]  he does what I told you  yeah  he changed the song  so much  yeah  it's just a shadow  of it's former self  like if you knew  the actual song  and you wanted  to sing along  you'd be fucked  yeah  Clapton did that  with Layla  and that was  his own song  alright  very very good  there you go  that's a guilty pleasure  though  sometimes you're  punching around  you want to relax  drive  and not have  extreme road rage  you just  you know  someone cuts you off  and when he's like  you know  that it could be  you're like  that's okay  cut me off  that's fine 
[02:25:00]  you go  what hurry  am I in  you know what  let me pay that  toll for you  just as long as  they don't cut you  off during that  let my fire  let my fire  let my fire  that's when I gotta  punch out  I'm out of the song  let my fire  let my fire  Jose you were  doing so good  well we're in a  we're in an  uncomfortable position  Carl's  cause we had a  comedian come on  the air  oh don't be  uncomfortable  that guy  don't worry about it  that guy's been  talking smack  for years dude  for years  that's why  I like  finally said 
[02:25:30]  something in Tucson  cause the guy  had been talking  so much smack  it was like  dude  just stop talking  about me  so for all you  like into this  whole thing  people  you can call  a morning show  called the locker  room in Denver  called KBPI  and ask them  if three years ago  this guy was  talking smack  it's just like  oh my god  I don't think  anybody's actually  denying the fact  that smack  is being smuck  but it's  but it's like  no he is  he came in here

[02:49:30]  an uncle named carlos and that's how it started but to be honest with you my dream would be that  this gets so huge that i could actually change my name back to ned so people would know me like for  my real name yeah that's actually that's actually funny though to be the way you are and come out  and say hi i'm ned i mean i think that's hysterical well now it is because i'm you know how about carlos  melancamp mencia as you know just to get people used to it can i get the cougar i want cougar first  i want cougar and and then i'll get rid of it it'll be uh carlos ned cougar mencia why can't be cougar 
[02:50:00]  because that's not mexican enough chihuahua like you know get a get a beaner animal in there well  obviously there's something going on that we like i don't know how it started you apparently don't  know how it started we i used to be really good friends with joe now they're to go work out  together we used to hang out together and then he started hanging out with uh at other comedy clubs  and then uh george who was fucking hates me you know what i mean but with george lopez here's a guy 
[02:50:30]  who last week actually said i don't want to see any hispanic comedians succeed except for me  that's how sick this fucking thing gets like you would say some shit like that that made me cry dude  i mean not because of me personally but dude when you're the only fucking beaner on network television  and there's you know fucking thousands of young guys trying to be you there's pablo francisco's  there's gabriel iglesias there's all these young kids that you know emulate you that want to be like 
[02:51:00]  you and you fucking tell them to their face yeah i don't want you to succeed because you're hispanic  that's that's like the el howard o sterno of the spanish community but but you guys know what  that's like who who rabino they are ripping me off tell them frederico tell them frederico would you  please to be tell them so i don't know where it comes from and i've tried really hard to be like 
[02:51:30]  really cool and nonchalant about it yeah i really have but last week when this when we were just  talking about comics and this guy goes oh yeah he was in here a couple months ago and he said  something bad about you and i was like fuck man one one other thing he said was that you were  walking around watching his act of course i watch comics when i'm at the comedy store that's what i do  but then you had turned it around as if he was walking around he has to watch my act he has to watch my  or if he doesn't watch my act how does he know i steal uh i don't know i'm just throwing out what 
[02:52:00]  was said that's my he says he's got on video yeah when you were saying that he was watching your act  that he actually had left like really quickly he barely saw i know he has me on videotape and he says  the reason he says that uh uh that you're ripping off people's act is because it's someone it's  something that's known all around the la comedy community whatever quote quote the joke he didn't  that's it he was pissed off in here dude he was mad he grabbed uh track two he was actually pissed 
[02:52:30]  off this motherfucker he actually called me a fat fuck i think you know you know what though he's an  animal oh my god that's why i don't want to fuck he's huge dude i'm gonna put you in a he'll  fucking kill my ass you ever seen with that like extreme fighting shit and like that's why he is so  scary that's why i'm gonna take joe rogan's side because uh you fucking fag you fucking fag because  i like my life no it's all right but hey one for rogan's side because i like my life and he might 
[02:53:00]  not pass the test i don't know your i don't know your fighting resume i know his but i don't need a  fighting resume i i got i got puerto rican back up here all right wait well let me think let me think  about this now see right here i could i could say mi gente latina unguero me está jodiendo  you just called in an attack i'm just i'm just telling you right now dude here come the low  you guys are gonna you guys are gonna get phone calls he's got sleeper cells  right now they're going wake up wake up right now if you listen closely you could hear the click 
[02:53:30]  of a hundred switchblades  wake up we have heard finally the sound of action  here's another clip here's another clip of uh joe rogan  so my cameraman happened to be there the day carlos claims that i was watching him from the stage  and instead what we have is me on stage and him watching me pacing around the room 
[02:54:00]  watch me for the guy imitates everyone including me all the time he steals from everyone whether it's  george lopez or paul mooney or old richard prior albums the guy's a fucking idiot and all he does  is rehash other people's shit or rewrite other people's shit you know you do a joke about going to  the fucking zoo whatever it is and if it kills he'll do a joke about going to the zoo and just  rewrite your shit he's a weak-minded fucking simpleton and he doesn't know that people know 
[02:54:30]  he's a weak-minded simpleton hey it's getting uncomfortable in here oh my god that's by the  way one of my most uh sought after bits my going in the zoo bit it's famous around the country no  it really is call people up and ask them hey what's carlos's number one bit it's not putting  the stocking over my head and pulling it back it's not the asian thing or the whole it's when he went 
[02:55:00]  to the zoo holy shit that fucking bit about going to the zoo was hellacious okay get the fuck out of  here the thing that fascinates me about this whole situation is it's so personal yeah that i can't  just see this let's get one thing i have not talked shit about the guy i've never said anything personal  about him i never will i i don't i don't feel the need to demean other guys in all right fair enough i 
[02:55:30]  haven't heard you ever attack the guy personally right but there is such this personal thing that  he has right that he has made vote that he's vocalized toward you right like like wow that was  that was very personal yeah i i don't know what dude i swear to god i don't know what it is  yeah and by the way he'll tell you that we were at the comedy store at the same time obviously the  evidence is there he's never come up to me and said hey man i got a fucking problem with you  you do this you do that i would address it i don't think any comics do that you're all a bunch 
[02:56:00]  of motherfuckers no no i got i actually got an email from a guy in boston and said i'm doing this  joke and somebody says it's like a joke you did and i read the joke and i said no it's not go ahead  and do it but the guy sent me an email because someone said that's a adam ferrara joke it was my  email it was you yeah it was my bob ross painting bit you son of a bitch you bastard  1988 1988 you stole my bob ross paint a bit and gave it on the couch and gave it away this is a true 
[02:56:30]  story actually what there's a little something going on between no we were we listen to this  you're sitting on the couch you're sitting around one of those afternoons drinking call him a fat  fuck you fat fuck you are a simpleton motherfucker my real name is ned you fake italian  you pasta-eating motherfucker you really don't like calzones yeah you're not latino and he's not  italian hello tell the story his name is adam hindenburg isn't he we uh we're just hanging 
[02:57:00]  around and uh bob ross we used to watch bob ross paint and uh but he was telling some story one day  and i found it fascinating about how he paints these nice happy trees and scenes now because he saw a lot  of bad things when he was in vietnam right so i just got the idea that it was hysterical that this  guy was in vietnam and he's got his little afro and he's painting happy scenes and rabbits and stuff  when in the nam he's probably in the shit you know charlie in the bushes and it would be funny to see him 
[02:57:30]  have a vietnam flashback as he's painting these things instead of a happy tree and there we put a  little agent orange on the picture what's in the tree a happy rabbit no that's charlie okay now we got  set fire to the hooch over here in the corner and it just kind of was one of those things and um  uh we were hanging out and adam just started getting rolling in comedy and wanted to do the  bit it was like fine take it you know i where's my outlet uh the tin knockers on the job site i was 
[02:58:00]  going to that day so he takes it and that was the end of it until i turn on snl one night and who was  on there uh what was his name joey cola joey cola yeah was on saturday night live he was yeah when  did joey do he was on snl one night because i was watching it and he was one of the comedy guests  that came out i think it might have been one of those nights they got to throw someone off and  he was like there so they put him on and i'm watching and i see bobby start doing my bit to a 
[02:58:30]  t not even one of those it might be the zoo bit it might not be the zoo bit you know your famous zoo bit  it's incredible you've heard it right it's amazing it wasn't even that it was the same  lines and everything and i'm like oh my dear sweet christ he's doing my bit so i called up adam  and and and i asked him and you're already laughing saying oh i traded him for some other bit you told  me that you talked to him and traded him a bit no i didn't you were taught is it i'll give you a bit 
[02:59:00]  for a scooter got him got him need him got him sunday night to try out the bit joey was up before  me doing a bob ross painter bit joey was an established comic i was an open mic i'm like  fuck i can't do the same premise he no one's gonna believe that you know anthony no one knows anthony  cumia from the couch that's right so i said look i got this other bit he goes do it he goes well i've  been doing this for a while i said all right because my bit was about him being in vietnam and he goes  see because no one knew he was in vietnam well yeah but he was doing the painter bit so that's how 
[02:59:30]  joey did it but i never gave everyone did a bob ross painter bit that but mine was the idea of  bringing him to vietnam that's what i said that's what that's the best part that's what you gave him  everyone was going happy trees happy trees no one was going look charlie you're watching a 25 year  relationship break up in front of your eyes they've been friends for 25 years ignorant motherfucker  ignorant motherfucker simpleton you you rip me off nazi cocksucker you're not even really italian 
[03:00:00]  anti-semitic you did that fucking olive garden commercial you're not a real italian yeah  hospitaliana what does that even fucking mean you were in a band called as is that covered a cat  steven song what all right now you've gone too far now now this is personal now you're gonna throw  down what what's that steven song oh which one did we cover what was that wild world oh god that's  hilarious oh it was awful i wish i had an answer for you guys i really do i really do wish i had an 
[03:00:30]  answer for you guys and uh his other big point and this is one that now i gotta come out and say i  agree i agree with joe rogan on this one yes the punisher that wasn't me though you absolutely gave  yourself the name no i did not i did not pick hold on let's play the club it's all right it's really  not okay you're like an asshole you're asshole wait wait we'll get into here's joe rogan first of all  nobody calls that guy the punisher they call him the phony mexican or they call him carlos menstelia 
[03:01:00]  that's all anybody calls him if you go to the comedy store that's what you hear oh dude the phony mexicans  here or carlos menstelia is here and what happens everybody gets nervous because carlos sits in the  back of the room with a fucking tape recorder and watches people's sets wow with a tape recorder  at least give me credit for learning your shit dude at least come on guy i'm not gonna go in  there with a tape recorder i'm better than that i mean i didn't cross the border by telling them 
[03:01:30]  i'm crossing on this day at this time wouldn't that be great if you brought in a court stenographer  to sit in front of the stage and just take down everybody's act that would be really that would  be fucking hilarious no no no now the punisher who gave you the name the punisher it was the it was  the comedians and it's a fun name to have and now that's something stuff now joe is saying that comics  are such self-centered dickwads they don't want anyone to sound cooler than than they are or that 
[03:02:00]  they uh portray them except when you have a tv show and you can give them work those are the  people that are calling you the punisher no no no i'm saying once you have a tv show young comics  don't talk shit about you anymore like like i'll give you an example there were four comedians that  told me the story about what happened four comedians and i called each of them up and they were like  please don't involve us in this shit dude please don't get us involved in this shit do not mention my  fucking name just fucking please do not you know because they're scared because somebody can give 
[03:02:30]  them a job so you couldn't get a young comic that that might think any comic could give them a job to  talk shit yeah they're gonna you know they're gonna shoot themselves in the foot now i haven't heard i  haven't heard carlos menstelia and i haven't heard that was pretty funny the phony mexican is great  like you're sitting there with a drawn-on big mustache and like one of those big sombrero from  sears like just everything looks fake an inflatable donkey and i walk on stage going bring the women to 
[03:03:00]  me i will rape and pillage the village that's my favorite is the phony mexican poncho on but the  punisher is too cool a name yeah for anyone to have but that's that's why i put it on hats and  stuff when they introduced me when they introduced me the punisher of comedy i swear to god it's the  funniest shit ever and the the hats the punisher hats yeah big sellers big big money makers do you 
[03:03:30]  understand there was a movie out and a comic book named the punisher no no no but it's not the  punisher it's punisher it's not actually protected jesus christ are you kidding me i swear to god  the punisher isn't the punisher but punisher different son of a bitch and i spell it like a  beaner so there's a couple of letters missing i just cannot get past the fact that it's too cool  a nickname people give other people nicknames stinky fatso i got a asshole douchebag but punisher is 
[03:04:00]  like god damn i got hard on when i heard it yeah yeah a friend of mine comes up and goes dude all  those comics just said you're the punisher and i went i'm stealing that one and i pulled out my  tape recorder went punisher oh there it is note to self refer to self as punisher that's exactly  call hat company start production of merchandise find out what is trademarked it was great dude it's 
[03:04:30]  great damn i i i don't i don't know i wish i i wish you know what i'm saying i wish i could i could  point it out and i could address it i wish there was like a way to say it's definitely something  personal there this is that maybe it's the comedy star maybe you ever watch fear factor  yeah yeah sometimes it's a fucked up show but i hate you see here's what i hate i hate the fact  that you know i can't really engage in this you know what i'm saying like to a certain point  because it's like there's no reason for it but part of part of me you know what i mean  part of me does want to part of me is like well of course part of me is like and then the other 
[03:05:00]  part is like there's you know what my mom always taught me if you ever put somebody down and make  yourself better it's because you're not as good as you think you are you want to be and i just kind  of go raised in switzerland your mom probably had a lot of wise saying right actually it wasn't  switzerland it was france we were on our way out of germany at the time all right and the boots  were marching behind us and she said you know don't don't call us come on we're going to france  they're going to surrender we'll find a nice home exactly now the now we'll make some wine now the 
[03:05:30]  listeners are saying uh you did say something bad about rogan who uh he bashed rogan on the obscure  radio show you have the audio he bashed rogan i didn't bash rogan i said he says that i steal  he walks around saying i'm not mexican and then when they add the only thing that could sound  bad is when they said why do you think these comedians do it and i said because they're  jealous because i'm funny because they got nothing on me that is the only thing to be construed but 
[03:06:00]  that's me just hypothesizing upon right why this is going on because i have no idea but i never  find the audio where i say joe rogan sucks or that joe rogan's not funny or that joe rogan's a piece  of shit find that because i never said it well we will cut up what you just said make it sound like  you're saying that and when joe rogan comes back to new york you're in trouble oh and i know you  would you fucker and then you'll mix it in with the painting then all of a sudden i'll be at the 
[03:06:30]  zoo painting little pictures of charlie the zoo picture i was at the zoo and that's charlie in my  painting we might have the audio i don't know let's let's listen to this from the frank show in  arizona it's true you're right actually frank it was joe rogan to dennis leary and dennis leary  actually came out and called him out on it yeah and joe just cowered why why is joe all of a sudden  determined that he's the arbiter of comedy and he's going to put everybody in check what's up with joe 
[03:07:00]  because he i don't know man it's it's insecurities it's like look when i go on stage okay this weekend  for example i'm going on stage with 11 other comics okay okay we're doing 12 000 seats in la  20 000 seats in san jose california right right all right so we're doing this huge venue i'm telling  you right now that from a competitive standpoint i want to be the funniest guy on that stage just  like i want to kick everybody's ass it's just like everybody in radio that does morning radio they want  to be the funniest show the most popular show shut up it's not about you the night that doesn't matter 
[03:07:30]  yeah you're right because it's all about putting the effort forth i think the force is with you carlos  don't listen to that joe rogan yeah i don't know you see what i'm saying i don't really see the uh  i never i never i haven't heard anything i i have not heard any bad mouthing no but i don't that's  my point and that's why it's kind of laughable it's like what's i don't know uh john from jersey  hey didn't sam kinnison do the bob ross vietnam bit on hbo about 18 years ago i don't know  i did you steal it from i came up with it wait a minute 18 years ago wait a minute he stole it and 
[03:08:00]  accused you of stealing you stole it let me tell you something unless sam was at bob ross's taping  of that fucking show because i was sitting there when he was doing the vietnam episode  when he first brought up that he was in vietnam oh that bit was fresh off the griddle  you flipped it over and turned it into a pancake that's right it was my pancake it was raw it was  raw batter before you got it all right let's say hi to dave in philly dave what's up hey guys what's 
[03:08:30]  up we're talking to the punisher no punisher the punisher i'm sorry punisher nend punisher in studio  yes go ahead dave hey um one of what's strange about joe rogan is the fact that he says that  these giant apes exist and i went online you know did a little research on it and he's the type of guy  that leads everything he reads online the bondo the bondo chimp yeah yeah the bondo chimp and do you 
[03:09:00]  want to know what you know i look at this incident here between him and you know i'm on television side i  really don't feel that you know he's doing this shit and you know in this bondo chimp issue i mean  god i mean who i mean don't you think that there would have been a discovery you know he's going off  on the uh bondo chimp thing well rogan was in here and he was talking about the bondo chimp some kind 
[03:09:30]  of giant chimpanzee yeah yeah yeah the giant ape that does body work to joe yeah to joe rogan's defense  he had just finished a pot lollipop when he did it so you know it might have been a little iffy on  the facts they wanted to defend you and i don't know but that's the whole thing about it you know  what this is perfect because rogan got his say carlos gets his say and it's up to you know whatever  but but for all you guys out there seriously that are taking this shit seriously you need to get a 
[03:10:00]  fucking life i'm being very serious you need to understand that carlos mencia and joe rogan  are fucking comedians we tell fucking jokes we're not curing cancer we're not uniting the world we're  not getting jews and palestinians to come together we're not getting puerto ricans to stop raping chicks  in central park we're not doing any of that stuff we're just telling fucking jokes don't take any of  this shit so seriously none of it i'm serious well joe rogan he said that there's a giant chimp and 
[03:10:30]  that's bullshit it's a fucking joke it's a fucking joke  the capital of south dakota is pierre i am very offended that you're not playing german shit  you better go in your fucking archives right now and find some german shit to play you get a march  damn it we'll find a march for you i saw carlos mencia sitting in the back of the comedy store 
[03:11:00]  singing with his buddies with big pewter beer steins rocking them back and forth in his hand  i saw it let's go to steve in kentucky the phones are just ridiculous so we gotta we just gotta go  that's fine that's fine trying to move on to something else go ahead steve it's all good  go ahead steve yeah ned yes uh you said you and uh this joe rogan used to work out together  uh yeah a long long time ago when he first came into a town like in the early 90s when he did this 
[03:11:30]  tv show called hardball on fox that's like his first tv show we we were actually friends we'd go  work out i'd hang out at his house he's a really good pool player i'm a shitty pool player but i try  so we used to go hang out before we we were actually you know decent friends yeah well uh  my question is you know sound me like he's got some issues uh did you ever date his wife or his  sister or others no i never banged any of his well now that would give him a viable issue 
[03:12:00]  but if i had that was you know sound me like he's got some problems there or something i mean  you're comedians you tell jokes uh you know i drive a truck uh and i hear a joke that might apply you  know say like uh the the bikers or something and you change it to fit truck driver you know this truck  driver said this or whatever right all right and uh yeah but sometimes they don't work you can't say  how do you babysit a polish person you wet their lips and stick them to the wall that doesn't work 
[03:12:30]  this is true  let's go to texas mike what's up should have went with the velcro on the ceiling and have him jump  on the bed just want to tell el presidente mancia that he misheard them that he was saying  they were saying the pinocher not the punisher oh that would be funny see that's a good that's a  good line now what is that here's here's what it is  spanish for pussy pinocha is pussy in spanish oh so they were costing you a pussy 
[03:13:00]  so pinocher is a version of pinocha  all right maybe you just by the way i don't steal but you're not comedian so fuck you i'm taking that  you know what i'd buy a pussy hat  the funny thing is on the five freeway in between in between that's what it says pinocher  in between la and san jose there's actually a road called pinocha road and then little pinocha road 
[03:13:30]  little pussy road and and everybody that speaks spanish just laughs their fucking ass off and white  people have no idea because it's like pussy and little pussy road yeah it's the funniest shit ever  i was wondering if it was a six lane highway  let's see uh wow a couple more here mike in delaware mike what's up hey i have a question  he was on the other radio show and talked with an attitude about rogan he said that he didn't sit in 
[03:14:00]  the back of the room he doesn't listen to him rogan was coming in and out listening to his bit i know  no he never said i don't listen to other comics i never i never said that when i go to the comedy  store listen when i go to the comedy store like every other comic i don't know if you know this  but a comedy store is where like comics hang out and do 15 minutes each we all we all hang out and  watch that's what we do we're comedians you know what i mean and uh so i never said that i don't  that i don't watch i said i don't have time when i'm doing 50 weeks a year to go hang out and try 
[03:14:30]  to steal people's shit yeah if i wanted to i've been to the comedy store dozens of times and these guys  are all there at the same time waiting to go up of course you're sitting there watching  yeah there's nothing else to do the room's dark you can't even play cards or anything and you're  sitting there watching and waiting for the light to go on so you can go on next because let's be  honest comics are pieces of shit and we want to go on and more than anything you see comics back  there just waiting for that light to go on when that light goes on that's it that's it we're like  every comics intro should be our next act has a void in his life he fills with the adulation of 
[03:15:00]  strangers please welcome daddy never hugged me searching for some type of meaning in his hard  existence please laugh or he'll kill himself he could be german could be mexican we think he's  honduras we know him as ned but it's carlos mancia i was at the zoo the other day  uh flea from cringe humor go ahead flea hi carlos what's up i want to preface this by saying flea is 
[03:15:30]  on the line here going put me on the air with this guy that's right i did say that carlos you are  unfunny you're a hack nobody likes you from any website i'm from cringe humor and that's not even  the point wow nobody likes you you are unfunny flea why don't what you can't deny that the guy  is funny and and he's successful well how can you say no one likes no denying that he's successful but 
[03:16:00]  a lot of people who are on comedy central just picked up his second season of mind of mencia  he's going to sell out uh carolines all this weekend so so so where does this no one no one likes  him no i'm not saying that you could say you don't like him you could say uh the gang of  cringe humor dot net doesn't like him but to say no one likes him is that it's kind of silly i mean  he doesn't even have to defend that it's a small niche on the west coast that likes him it is that  by the way i just sold out in uh i'm selling out of new york and i just uh i sold i'm selling i'm 
[03:16:30]  already sold out next week in richmond virginia and last week i sold out in charlotte north carolina  that is a niche of the southwest right what i think that area just play but that's fine i never i never  said i'm trying to every fucking five minutes and nobody cares play i'm trying to help you out  your argument is ridiculous when you say no one cares that's not that's not true the guy's very  successful he's been for many years and uh this comedy central show is blowing up you can't say that 
[03:17:00]  no one likes and that's stupid no it's true there are people that like him but it's that small niche  it is that group you're gonna call chris rock next and tell him to stop saying nigga  listen yeah but at least when chris rock does it it's funny you don't put the but don't don't  listen to me don't watch my show i'm not forcing me down anybody's throat this is what you guys don't 
[03:17:30]  fucking understand is that the new promo comedy central's running from you you know what yeah don't  listen to me the promos were i think uh uh we gave him a voice we're getting lawyers we know people  are gonna half my show is reading hate mail if you don't like my shit don't but here's the thing  here's the thing don't fucking call and call me a spick and then pretend that race isn't an issue  don't fucking come in here go it doesn't matter fucking spick obviously it fucking matters you're  racist and i don't give a shit that you are go watch whoever you want to watch i never be racist 
[03:18:00]  no somebody earlier called have you watched mine and mencia i've seen it once and i didn't like it  so i don't watch it and that's that's awesome that's what you should say for you people are  and they're yeah but to me it's just it's tiresome material it's back voices it's not be nice and  just say it's not your cup of tea it really isn't my cup of tea but you know what it's also not a lot  of other people's and you know what it's this it's just all right flea what flea what is what is your 
[03:18:30]  favorite uh comedy show oh that's a good question my favorite i actually don't watch tv  uh hang up on this fucking asshole once say see this is the kind of shit i'm talking that's why  i don't like responding to this stuff ryan stupid yes go ahead ryan hey uh i had a question you said  that uh you know joe's just starting shit with you but when you went on that radio station all the  stuff you said was fake you made all that shit up uh the only thing you could say i made up is a  story that a couple of comics told me about you know making telling him that's the only thing 
[03:19:00]  everything else ever paced back and forth in the back of the room like you said dude if joe never  watched me perform how could he know that i steal shit joe after that show that night joe went right  outside he went back in for like one minute you made it sound like he was pacing back back and forth  that's why joe got probably so upset that you're just making a bunch a bunch of shit  that you know he watches me perform that you go from okay and i'm not going to tell you who it is 
[03:19:30]  all right  you see what i'm fucking saying and i'm not going to tell you who it is  i'm surprised it didn't end with a  it's hilarious it's hilarious and uh listen like i said for all you guys that want to check 
[03:20:00]  call kbpi it's a station in denver it's called the locker room morning show and ask them if joe  hasn't been saying negative shit about me stealing for years it's just finally i got pissed off i finally  got pissed off and was like you know i'm tired of this guy fucking bad mouthing me every time  somebody says hey what do you think of carlos mancia all right fucking steals  ask me what i think of joe rogan what do you think of joe rogan i think he's a funny guy  i don't personally he doesn't get along with me he's got a problem with me i got no problems with 
[03:20:30]  that's boring that's it we want to hear you say something he just doesn't want to get in a grapple  hole yeah really on the stage of uh the comedy story you know what because if there was if i really  disliked his comedy or personal or something i i would i i really would yeah but i i don't i don't  i don't hate on other comics well obviously you like his material it's given you a good living for  many years i'm telling you dude his material listen if you had the word beaner to his stuff 
[03:21:00]  holy shit mexicans eat it up i'm gonna look forward to the azubit when i come down to see you  i don't know what the guy's problem is i really don't look at the difference in demeanor i'm  laughing i'm at you dude he was in here pissed and that was after the pot lollipop so yeah there  was a little puck uh involved pot lollipop someone is like yelling at me on the answer feedback the  jew from whack back hey opie isn't motherfucking howard stern popular we never questioned his  popularity you ass we questioned if he's actually doing an entertaining show anymore 
[03:21:30]  see what i mean we never questioned uh howard stern's popularity yeah but i think that's what  the guy's getting at is that you can be popular and not funny like you were telling that guy look  carlos has a show okay he got picked up blah blah blah but you know he could still be popular and what  you were saying is look he's done that and that guy's pointing out howard but no it's different  because flea's like saying that uh no one finds carlos you know funny right that would be like us 
[03:22:00]  saying no one finds howard entertain and that would sound completely ridiculous right we we uh we  question how he treats his uh his his own people fellow employees uh it's like saying everyone thinks  there's a bondo monkey and we've we've uh we've also fucking bombing with the bondo monkey  we've also stated we've also said that there's one that he's not trying anymore you know he's still  you know he's still putting on an entertaining show because you know the numbers show but we 
[03:22:30]  don't think he's trying anymore he doesn't give a fuck he doesn't give a shit bondo monkey hangs out  with the chupacabra say oh and what about this civilization i think he's a fake jew howard  they call him phony jew for jew for jew all right we should take a break yes do you want to still  hang carlos yeah sure and i i love you guys i've always loved you guys i forgive you adam and for  trading well these two have been eyeing each other since that i got a trading i got a blast from the 
[03:23:00]  sandwich yeah your uh your and your ex-producer was actually in san jose at that big theater thing  that we did yeah so we were talking about you the whole time it was awesome good old rick he's doing  all right i hear yeah oh yeah after he got fired from here he's at that station oh yeah he's got fired  a couple times he's got to be a good boy man because they sent him to the capital of homosexuals  and asians two of his favorite targets yeah i mean believe me we have more songs of him bragging  on gay people and asians well he's already he's already in trouble with the asian community oh yeah 
[03:23:30]  he didn't do anything and he was in trouble just for moving there and they're on they're on like  the websites going godzilla's coming that's how they picture rick blowing fire out of his mouth  and stepping on their building he come fast he come from his coast all right gary hoey you should  get us out of here uh wait a minute make sure he dot com before he starts playing uh carlos's tape  recorder is going to interfere with his uh amp yeah turn off your tape recorder i apologize 
[03:24:00]  let me get stenographer get out of the room get out of goddamn room we actually had people we  actually had people email us saying that you stole something from us i'm gonna start this by saying  obviously that did not happen remember when you were in here yeah you guys turned me on to the  idea of the guy that shit in the uh and what we did was we gave him an award right that's all it was  it was we gave him a titiri award for for uh you know the guy that they found in the uh in the  porta potty looking at girls as they were taking dumps right you were here we had a lot of fun with 
[03:24:30]  that and then it ended up on your show but of course something like that should end up on a comedy show  yeah but and and it was completely different we just gave him an award no i understand i'm not  saying you did it yeah it's just this is how people think and they did the story i think on  a weekend update on snl and the daily show so it's it was like it was an ap story stole it from me  fucking stole it sons of bitches there are times that there's just obvious shit like uh katie holmes  and tom cruise are having a baby right right so i was watching uh leno and letterman last night 
[03:25:00]  they both had the exact same joke so who ripped off who or was it that the obvious thing  yeah but but leno's not really mexican that's true he's not nope you know that was german that  was the only timely joke letterman had and then he's talking about uh crime in new york city and  rats it's like jesus dude wasn't carson doing those jokes before he went out to la it's like  it's like those are old new york bits get out of your compound and walk around a while and and see  what's going on in new york yeah well you won't hear the comics you won't hear either of these 
[03:25:30]  comics bash and letterman okay i'm just i'll you know whatever bash letterman  what did i say earlier you won't get young guys to talk shit about me you won't get me to talk  shit about letterman no he still refers to hookers hanging out in times square it's like have you  been down there in the last decade yeah it's clean there's not a hint of a of a hooker down there  anymore no it's a shame i couldn't find one last night anywhere but it's it's crazy where are they  it's surprising it's surprising to me that he obviously has writers or he has uh writers around 
[03:26:00]  them you would think they they would you know be brave enough to go uh dave the hookers or something  they're not there anymore he had a great joke still works joke he should hire my writers dude  my writers holy shit when they write something that's funny they do not fucking let it go i mean  i had to say a couple times like right before we taped guys we need to write a different fucking joke  for that but it's funny well when you have the show of lookner you know the mind of lookner you 
[03:26:30]  can put it on your fucking show but it's a minor mencia we need a different joke these guys oh my god  they like they cling to that shit really funny guys though pounding something on the ground  it's this program right here speaking of which mike from california go ahead mike hey you guys are  fucking great you are blown up out here in california i put xm in all my work trucks and i won't hire a  fucking guy unless we listen to your fucking show thank you you fucking fuck hey isn't that comedy 
[03:27:00]  you gotta say the fucking f word yeah that's right yeah yeah listen used to be a fucking stern fan  started listening to you guys the guy's just not funny anymore um and see it and i've never listened  to you man i gotta be honest but uh you haven't been very funny on the show today and guys i gotta  call you out you haven't played all the radio clips of him talking shit about rogan about how rogan  was standing backstage you know he said that shit you guys should play that just to be fair  you know i i think joe's a funny guy and you know if i had to go to war obviously who do you want on 
[03:27:30]  your side right so oh yeah real war with fighting involved seriously if you if you if there's a real  war you want me because i got much more backup much more backup i think joe can take them single  nazis or spix man huh nazis or spix yeah the beaners i'm telling you nazis and spix that's a  good combination yeah that's who you want dude that's who carl's is going to bring to the fight  here's the deal that's right beanerschnitzels mike we could we could go on good i'll give you that 
[03:28:00]  we could we could go on for hours what are we supposed to do uh replay joe rogan's uh entire  appearance we we hold on that's what that's what i was going to say we did tell joe that carl's was  coming in because when that was all going down lucky us we're like whoa carl's is coming in within  a week or 10 days of uh that appearance i forget it probably a little over a week so i said joe you  got the hotline get a burling call if you want if it's a big deal i think we did a good enough job  like uh confronting uh ned punisher and uh and and uh you know we played we played some highlights and 
[03:28:30]  we uh we asked you know we asked anthony asked some tough questions but every questions i wasn't  going to ask everything was answered yeah but by the way how far do you want us to go with this  if joe rogan cares that much he'd call our show and uh and and and go at it with them i don't know  what to tell you thank you sir looking for you at the yankee game we got you last night out here in  cali yeah well it's all tied up back to the stadium we'll see how it goes all right guys i'll be  listening thanks a lot all right mike bye you had that little friggin chinese guy on the mound last night 
[03:29:00]  right oops it's weird because uh you know now it looks like we're picking sides because now we got  carlson here we did the best we can and then when joe shows up next time we'll we'll kiss his ass and  make you look stupid so i am not gonna i'm just fucking with you you don't understand this see like  this is radio yeah my i got some emails going dude fucking opie hung out with you before he didn't  defend you and i was like dude that's radio they're they're putting on they're doing a show you fuck 
[03:29:30]  that's what they're supposed to do i like when rogan comes in and goes off like he did and then  have you come in and answer it that's all that's that's all we're looking for exactly that's it  do i bravo in the end do i in the end do i care no neither do i no neither do i because here's the  thing it's like i haven't done any material you know what i mean we haven't done like the normal  type of interview where you guys ask me some shit and then i go off on hurricane katrina victims and all  that kind of stuff you know some hurricane uh material please please but that's my point so i 
[03:30:00]  haven't done any of that so people that have never heard me are like fuck man there's nothing funny  about what's going on in there oh no yeah so they're judging me by that but i don't give a shit hold on  gary hoey what's your latest album i'm kidding i'm kidding the new album's called monster surf  all right in store now all right play us a little something going into break because when we get back  chink in the painting hurricane katrina material from that's what i want to play i want to play

[03:32:00]  of the comics on the opie and anthony show hey this is nick dapallo and this is the worst of bill  burr that red-headed freckled fag from boston and we got bill burr in studio hello and he's very  excited because uh brett michaels is coming in in about 20 25 minutes and you're a big fan of rock  of love oh great show are you a fan because you think it's a great show or or because it's kind 
[03:32:30]  of like i'm a fan because of how they started off the show out of all the humiliating things i've seen  on reality television they basically get you know it's basically flavor of love so they get 25  flavor of love for white guys right for the white audience they get 25 white whores this time right  they have them out in the driveway and you know brett comes up in his yellow motorcycle they're all  going crazy right there i think the show is ridiculous that they're going crazy over bret michaels 
[03:33:00]  right i mean back in the day i understand he was with pam and everybody else but come on  no but i mean come on if you saw these girls that's not reality if you saw these girls though they all  look like like the hottest girl at like denny's i mean retired stripper looking girls they're they're  horrific right so he pulls up everybody goes crazy and then he walks in the house and his big uh his  big bouncer guy stands there and he's looking at him welcome them all and all of a sudden he just 
[03:33:30]  starts calling off names called off like yeah he picks one girl then picks another girl by the time  he got to the third girl i'm saying to my girlfriend going they're going to kick these girls out  before they even get in the house exactly they pick five of them and all the other whores are  going like why am i not picking me right they get done picking they get done picking five of these  these girls and they're hideous they look like oh like they're just awful looking they tell the other  girls to go in the house and then they tell those five girls basically you're too ugly to even get 
[03:34:00]  into the house on on a horrific reality show that was awesome did they talk  to them later i'm very disappointed well there was one girl who just like all of them yeah  they all just like i'm embarrassed i came all the way from iowa like they're just like from horrific  states right the bus from oklahoma city was 72 hours just to get to utah i deserved more right but one 
[03:34:30]  girl just refused to leave wow she was just the the whore that wouldn't quit right so she comes back  you know and just starts pounding on the door and then they just they just had to let her in  and uh i mean she looked like she was every bit of 47 oh my god is that tiffany that was the girl  kept going don't threaten me with a good time tiffany we got that clip actually me with a good 
[03:35:00]  that that was her catchphrase they did a montage last night i don't know if it was on last night i  have it on dvr whatever but the episode i saw they did a montage of her saying that over and over again  and you know and when she says it is basically when someone's telling her to get her life together  someone's criticizing her someone's trying to give her some real good advice and that's what she's  yeah if you don't if you don't shape up we're kicking you out of the house now's that really good time  if you don't get off drugs we're taking away your children yeah that's right  she was a mess it's the catchphrase of the summer though it's fantastic we got the clip of tiffany 
[03:35:30]  uh trying to get back in the house after she was deemed uh too ugly to be in the house right  basically big johnny called out five names he told us you're out of here by the way bill thanks for  the huge setup wow really we just happen to have this clip five names he told us you're out of here  i didn't come all away from chicago to be eliminated before i even walked in the door  my name is tiffany hi tiffany you caught me and i was wondering why listen it's nothing personal 
[03:36:00]  this is physical if it was up to brett he wouldn't have dismissed me no brett if it was up to brett  the entire city of la would be here but i'm a big fan of his i had a hat made i came here all  away from chicago there's literally nowhere for you to sleep i'll sleep on the floor please please i'm  begging you i'll sleep in the bathroom i'll sleep in the kitchen i don't care i had a hat made i'll  do anything anything the music bags

[03:38:00]  you know what it's it's a good show i mean yesterday i was watching they had to do phone  sex because if brett michaels is on the road did you see that oh it's great i'm telling you it's a  great show you know brett's girls gotta like you know help him out if he's on the road and she's  back home sure so they had all these uh girls like dressing their hottest like lingerie and lay on  this like you know this like heart-shaped type bed and do phone sex and he's in another room and  they hooked up something did they hook it up to his yeah they actually hooked something up to his 
[03:38:30]  unit yeah to see if he would get aroused yeah and if you were terrible at it they would just  flatline the best part was brett would get halfway through if they stunk he just hung up on them  dude i'm telling you and we got some great bits on this show one girl just started uh just giving  phone sex and everyone else was like horrified like whoa man it's just a fun little show we're trying to  participate in and she's like i'll suck your beep the whole her whole segment was beeped out 
[03:39:00]  that was that was the weird thing in my beep it's all the other girls all the other girls are watching  so it kind of made it awkward but there were some girls that were just so bad at it they were just  like i just really want to spend time with you yeah i just you know i just think you're interesting  and it's just like lady what is this supposed to do for this guy this guy's a rock star he's probably  had an 18 on one you know what i mean oh my god brett let me tell you what i'll do i will take your

[03:41:30]  yeah that needed a set up obviously tiffany calls one of the two black girls in the house  it's an effing c word oh yeah she was dropping it dropping it like it was not that why would  they boot her yeah right did they boot her yet oh yeah yeah they boot yeah she was that's where  they're they're just so stupid why you would like the black keeper as long as you possibly can  you know they did it with sanjaya cannon you keep these people it makes it interesting it would 
[03:42:00]  have been good because the black girl on the show is hilarious she wore like a clip uh on uh cw11  oh there it is of a clip of the show yeah well i think uh i think he's on cw11 right now and then  he's heading over here oh yeah there he is it's still 1988 dude i was gonna say don't talk about him  but he's on there so he can't be here he can't listen to us he looks good though man i gotta say he  looks he doesn't look much different than he did a few years ago oh wow i mean they showed him in like 
[03:42:30]  pajamas without all that stuff like the headband oh that was bad oh my god he looks like a circus clown  out of his makeup oh it was bad dude there's he's had some stuff done on wow there's chicks like  pushing each other and no that that black girl's hilarious the other girl there is like she's  really into animals like peter and the black girl had a fur coat and she goes i hate animals she goes  they're for food and clothing and she goes how can you say that she goes if there was an animal in 
[03:43:00]  here right now i'd slit its throat just i swear to god just just to piss her off and she totally took  the bait it was great on last night's episode uh two girls went at it after the phone sex thing  and they're upstairs and one girl has like uh i think the the girl calls them circus boobs yeah  she's got implants that are so massive and they're really high up like way higher than they're supposed  to be and they just are bizarre they're massive and she calls them circus boobs they are a little  freakish look she looks like she has an ass right on her chest so the one girl thought she was 
[03:43:30]  going to be cocky and started making fun of her circus boobs so the circus boob girl goes oh yeah  and just starts making fun of her face and it turns out the the girl that has the kind of the face is  a little off is because she was in a car accident 50 stitches oh so so you know she started the like  the little fight and then circus boob goes well look at your awful face and she's like but that was  from a car accident like like you went too far with this and she started complaining to brett saying 
[03:44:00]  it was it's that's it's like a disability would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair right  but she was the one you know how it goes if you're gonna fight you're gonna you know you're gonna break  out all the uh all the weapons that's not fair i was in a car accident yeah if your face went through  a windshield you probably shouldn't start snapping on somebody yeah you shouldn't be talking about  someone's circus boobs they just uh showed a motorcycle accident a little uh motocross a little  crash one of those girls took face planted pretty good so they just put these whores in interesting 
[03:44:30]  little contests and competitions dude they're all whores they're all trying to act like they're not  whores but they have a stripper pole in there and then second they got drunk all of them were doing  those those you need a whore abs stripper moves on the pole you know you got like your legs straight  out it's like the only people who can do that are strippers yeah i didn't want to like the show but i  like it yeah that vh1 knows what they're doing with this celeb reality crap i was telling jim last night 
[03:45:00]  at the cellar like we were talking about you know how you know the reality tv and game shows there has  never been a better time in hollywood to be a has-been than it is right now you oh my god you're  right you have a better shot at getting a tv show than i think than anyone else somebody brand new yeah  scott bale i just want to punch him in the face have you seen that show the two quarries the two  quarries they were in here yesterday who worries yeah but my thing is what is the cutoff line where  even like you're too old i think it's like 75 i would say like tony dow isn't getting a reality show 
[03:45:30]  he was the older brother on leave it to beaver but then when you get to that old then you have  to herd the has-beens yeah you gotta put them all you gotta put them all in a house a surreal house  yeah after my three sons guys the my three sons sons you could get one of them yeah  and he just sat there crying how there was no residuals anyone from gilligan's island do you think  uh it had to be one of the women yeah marianne or ginger yeah yeah they could 
[03:46:00]  probably do it yeah hey uh we gotta like change gears a little bit here uh how to dial a rotary  phone we teased this before the break ah speaking of the olden days nice segue well you know speaking  of juan epstein yeah sometimes i just jam on the brakes well they could do that the the welcome  back cotter people would definitely be uh yeah because they had a horse shack in the uh the fights  remember that oh that's celebrity box they've just been through all these and they gather up the 
[03:46:30]  has-beens to beat each other up and horse shack got beat up by uh screech right yeah i'd love to be a  has-beens agent just to hear the offers that come in oh it's gotta be just hysterical vh1 wants you  for a celebrity toe jam race to the bottom of the grand canyon with the cast from family affair  just these horrific shows it's heading that way they're gonna get worse and worse 
[03:47:00]  uh it is vh1 i think that started all that stuff too they're the ones we first came up with yeah  yeah they're brilliant man well they came up with the concept celeb reality yeah they took the reality  show thing the celebrities involved with uh the reality shows making it making it cool because when  reality shows first hit no celebrity would be caught dead doing it's like oh that's hack stuff that  those are people that just can't make it uh you know legitimately yeah but then somehow vh1 talked  them into like well they don't get the big celebrities they get the has-beens which is  hysterical and watching these people uh you know living together or yeah but see where it's going
