<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining about technological difficulties, particularly Anthony's new phone. Opie then recounted a terrifying drive through a Brooklyn neighborhood he described using extremely offensive racial slurs, expressing fear for his family's safety. A Staten Island caller corroborated Opie's account of the area's dangerous nature.  The conversation transitioned to Opie's Father's Day, which featured a .50 caliber rifle, prompting a discussion about firearms and their destructive power (detailed by a Marine caller).  Jim Norton's visit was also mentioned. A pool worker caller, Greg, detailed the health hazards of fecal matter in pools.

The show then covered the World Cup, with a caller, Eddie, complaining about biased officiating.  The hosts discussed the annoyance of vuvuzelas, including a report of a woman injuring her larynx, and their use at a Marlins game.  Manute Bol's career, death, and skin disease were discussed, along with high service charges in sports and Lady Gaga's Yankees visit. A caller shared a story about Manute Bol's gambling.  Tiger Woods's performance at the U.S. Open was briefly mentioned.

The next segment focused on Tiger Woods's U.S. Open collapse and compared him to Jack Nicklaus.  The hosts reacted angrily to Joran van der Sloot's confession, BP's CEO enjoying a yacht race during the oil spill, and President Obama playing golf amidst the crisis. A caller, Eric from Kansas City, presented a conspiracy theory linking several movies and a TV show to predict a major event around June 22nd and war with Iran by July 11th. This sparked a lengthy discussion with other callers adding their own conspiracy theories.  The Gulf oil spill was discussed, with callers offering differing perspectives on its severity and impact. The segment concluded with discussion of the death of wrestler Trent Acid, the "wrestler death clock," Stone Cold Steve Austin's tweet, a Dakota Fanning movie, and further commentary on the oil spill.

The following segment began with Opie's frustrations with Apple's iPhone pre-orders and software updates, including an anecdote about his malfunctioning phone.  The hosts ranted about inconsiderate drivers involved in a traffic accident. The conversation shifted to Louis C.K.'s new FX show, with Louis C.K. as a guest in the studio.  He discussed the show's format, casting (including Bob Kelly, Nick DiPaolo, and Ricky Gervais), filming, budget, and a production assistant, Steve, who made unauthorized copies of the pilot.  Louis C.K. also discussed his firing from *Pootie Tang*, drunk tweeting, and Bill Donohue's criticism. A caller, James, expressed enthusiasm for Louis C.K.'s work.

The next segment, also featuring Louis C.K., focused on fatherhood, relationships, and their challenges. Louis C.K. discussed his experiences as a father, admitting to being a "pretty bad father."  The discussion included his views on a childless life, child adoption, and the frustrations of parenthood.  He recounted experiences with past relationships, including faking orgasms, and his divorce. Anthony shared similar experiences.  They discussed honest communication, leaving bad relationships, and justifications for staying in unhappy marriages. A caller, Jim, sought advice on his miserable marriage, leading to a discussion about divorce, child custody, and child support.  The conversation was punctuated by frequent offensive language.

The final segment, again featuring Louis C.K., began with discussions about his skills (disassembling an AR-15), aversion to children, and the freedom of being divorced. A caller, Dominic, discussed the death of a mutual listener, "Carl from Jersey," who was shot and killed by his wheelchair-bound wife after initiating divorce proceedings. Dominic requested the hosts promote a donation website for Carl's children (initially CarlMirasola.org, then carlskids.bbnow.org and 1-877-CARLS-KIDS). The hosts reacted with dark humor and attempts to help, while making jokes about the situation. A past call from Carl was played.  The conversation shifted to Louis C.K.'s experiences with fans, his honesty with strangers, and his dislike of small talk and parenting social dynamics.  Further jokes and speculation about Carl's death ensued. The segment concluded with discussion of Louis C.K.'s show "Louie," including an anecdote about Ricky Gervais, his dislike of inappropriate exposure, promotional mentions of his show and Jimmy Norton's appearance on Red Eye, and concluded with a crude Bob Kelly rap created by a staff member.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Our show is stupid.  This is so irresponsible.  This should be illegal.  It really should be.  It's like, it's so unethical.  God, I hate fucking radio.  This could be the worst audio ever.  Shut up. 
[00:00:30]  Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up.  We get it.  Get it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's go.  Let's do this.  Your stupid phone is scaring everybody, Anthony.  I'm cut off from society.  What is it, a paperweight?  I hate this.  What is that thing you've got in front of you? 
[00:01:00]  It's, I don't know, some kind of one of those LG phones that, like, AT&T.  It's a, you've got to slide it and there's a keyboard.  It's a girl phone.  It's a chick phone.  You bought that for a chick.  No, I actually just bought it as a, it's one of those, you know, you just kind of buy time  on it and you have it.  What I have is like a backup phone that I always keep in my beck, beck, as Sam says, just in 
[00:01:30]  case.  You've got a backup phone.  Yeah.  Are you a drug dealer?  No, it's just in case I forget my iPhone, which I did today.  I rarely ever, ever do that.  But since I do use it as my alarm clock, it's stuck in the dock in my, in my alarm clock  thingy.  And I left.  And then as I'm driving, I usually tap my pockets and go, did I remember everything?  Yeah.  And then I realized, oh fuck, didn't remember the iPhone.  But you got your backup girl phone. 
[00:02:00]  My chick phone.  It's, it's yeah.  Ooh, look, I'm going to, I'm going to open up my keyboard and start texting how dreamy the  guys are on that stupid vampire show.  Oh, enough already.  You want to send a Justin, you want to send a Justin Bieber?  Yes.  Text that Justin Bieber is dreamy.  And I just Twittered though.  I was like, how, how did we fucking function without, without this shit, fuck the phone  part of it.  Like phones have been around for quite a while, but like having the iPhone or, or I I'll be, 
[00:02:30]  I'll be nice.  Any other type of smartphone that, that you appreciate, appreciate shit like that.  Uh, it's, it's not just phone.  It's now your lifeline to everything you do that, you know, that you're information based.  You don't sit there and think about what, who was in what movie for that.  You just take it for granted.  It's like, oh, blip, blip, blip.  All my apps, my fun apps.  I don't have them.  You got nothing on the girl phone. 
[00:03:00]  I got one.  It's a crap.  One crap.  The keyboard.  Can I see that phone?  No.  Why?  I just want to check it out.  I've never seen an old phone like that before.  You'll smash it.  No, I won't.  You'll smash it.  That would be very predictable on my part.  You will smash it.  I was just telling Anthony, just really fast, uh, I, I lived a Jim Norton bit on Saturday  night.  Oh no.  I hope your chest smells better by now.  I, uh, I got the kid out of the house cause we're up to five, six weeks now.  So it did a lot of visiting and I was out on Long Island for a little party. 
[00:03:30]  And then we knew we were going to Philly for a father's day.  So I said, you know what, why go all the way back to Manhattan when we're packed and we  could go from Long Island to Philly and this will make sense for some of the locals.  It'll certainly make sense for Anthony.  So I decided to take the Southern route of Long Island and I'm going to go to the Verrazano,  which will put me on the New Jersey turnpike, which will, uh, you know, I'll make it down  to Philly.  What time is this?  About, uh, you know, 10 o'clock on a Saturday night. 
[00:04:00]  So you needed the belt parkway.  I needed the belt parkway, but I was on the Northern state parkway.  This is where I'm starting to confuse the non-locals.  So I'm on the Northern state.  I'm like, you know what?  I know I can still hit the Verrazano.  I know I have to go South eventually, but I'll keep going West for a while.  Eventually I'll go South and I'll hook up with the Verrazano.  Right.  I went too far in.  I'm in Brooklyn.  I'm on the Jackie Robinson Parkway.  I'm like, fuck, this isn't good.  I need, I need a highway South immediately. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  So now I pop in the address to the in-laws on the GPS.  I'm like, they'll fucking get me there.  This GPS is reliable.  So I pop it in and they say exit in two miles.  I'm like, oh, exit in two miles to my highway.  This is nice.  My GPS is working out for me.  Oh no.  Make a long story short.  I exit.  All of a sudden I'm at a traffic light.  I'm like, that's weird.  All right.  It must be a couple blocks and then back on the highway.  Then I take a left.  I'm like, okay, this got to be my left onto a highway.  No, I'm getting deeper and deeper into the ghetto of Brooklyn. 
[00:05:00]  And then they go, all right, take a right on Route 27.  This is where people could play along at home.  You could fucking Google this shit.  27, also known as Linden Avenue, also known as Vietnam.  I learned over the weekend after I tweeted this.  Now I got my...  Somalia.  I got my almost six-week gold in the car with my wife.  And now we're in the middle of the fucking ghetto.  And I look on 27.  This is the road they wanted me to be on.  All I see is red traffic lights for as far as the eye could see. 
[00:05:30]  I don't stop for those in Brooklyn in that area.  Oh, really?  I couldn't get around any cars.  I couldn't do nothing.  And sometimes people decide, even though the light's green, they didn't really need to go anywhere.  So they just decided they're going to hang out a few lights before they decide to move forward.  I was out of my mind.  You might as well have had a personalized plate that just said victim.  Oh, yeah.  I was on high alert.  Do you have your doors locked at least?  Of course.  Did you have it set on the thing, no toll road?  Sometimes a GPS will be set like that by mistake, and then it takes you back roads. 
[00:06:00]  But it's your bit where there should be a setting not to take you through the ghetto.  And my girl saw a drug deal going down, saw a BMW just show up somewhere, and everyone  jumped out of their cars.  Little kids in the streets with no parental supervision.  That's fantastic.  People walking in front.  It was like the start of one of these stupid fucking movies where Whitey gets stuck in the  ghetto.  Yeah.  Maybe with Chevy Chase or something. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, that would have been a funny one.  So I was on this Linden Avenue for at least a half hour, 40 minutes, finally got on, what,  the Queens, Brooklyn Expressway, right?  Or BQE.  Yeah.  The BQE.  And then finally on my way.  Get your ass out of there.  Yeah, I was scared.  I got to be honest.  I was a bit scared.  Well, because it's not just you.  No.  Yeah.  You know what?  That's what came to mind.  I'm like, you know, if it's just me, I know at the very least I could just fucking ditch  this car and just run.  Oh, yeah.  Just leave your wife and kid in the car, run away on Father's Day. 
[00:07:00]  How bad would that be?  You just tear ass out of your car and leave your wife and kid there.  Happy Father's Day.  Oh, shock jock runs away from family.  Wife and son aided by residents, and they're all nice, and they help you out, and they get  your cab home.  What's wrong with that motherfucker?  I don't know.  He's just frightened.  I was trying to act like, you know, I was trying to act like a white guy just getting 
[00:07:30]  drugs, I guess, because you can't even act like a white guy just, you know, just driving  through the neighborhood, because I didn't see anyone close to white for about a half  hour to 40 minutes.  Did you feel like anybody looked at you?  Did you feel like a...  I refused to look to my left or my right, because I was trying to make it look like,  yeah, I'm in this neighborhood.  That's right.  Oh, you got a head on a swivel.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm in this neighborhood.  Head on a swivel, blatantly locking doors, looking around, mouthing the word Negro.  My girl and baby are in the back, so I tell her to get one of my hats, so I pull my hat 
[00:08:00]  down low.  I'm like, I'll try to look...  That'll do it.  I'll try to look like something here.  Fuck.  And then people just walking right in front of the car with green lights.  Oh, yeah.  And then there are green lights.  Don't peep.  And I'm like, man, I don't give a shit if I get pulled over, because at least then I  can explain to a cop.  Yeah, the cop will understand.  You want...  Look, baby in the back, can you get me out of here, please?  Yeah, can I have an escort?  But I couldn't get around nobody.  And then I'd ride home.  Yeah.  That was funny, too.  Honey, things are bad.  Get my hat. 
[00:08:30]  Get my hat.  Get my hat.  So I don't look like a fucking American pie type of guy.  Was she scared, or does she not care?  Oh, no.  She's, you know, she's Philly, man.  She's all right.  I'm sure she's...  She has batteries to throw at her.  Yeah.  I'm sure she was a little scared, but, I mean, we, you know, we were just on high alert.  Just high alert.  Yeah, you get in a situation where you're like, okay.  And then I hit the Hasidic Jew area, and I'm like, okay, almost home.  You're safe.  Yeah, some weird hospital.  What's that about?  What, the...  Because it was kind of close to where you used to live. 
[00:09:00]  The Jewish hospital?  Yeah, some weird Jewish hospital.  Yeah, there's a few of them.  Where they only bring the Jews.  They only bring the Jews there.  All the writing on the side was in some kind of, like, bad penmanship.  Oh, Hebrew?  Yes.  Oh, I thought that was just bad penmanship.  It's the place where they only bring the Jews.  That's...  It was a Jew hospital.  Yeah.  Like, it looked like ambulances and stuff, but you couldn't tell, you know, what was written  on the sides of these things.  I'm sorry, you can't come.  Right.  And then I hit, like, some kind of Chinatown.  They got a Chinatown in Brooklyn or something? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Some kind of Asian area?  Yeah.  And then I got into the preppy area, and then I was like, okay, I'm good.  Then you're safe.  Yeah.  For the most part.  Let me say hi to Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  No talk.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Bobby.  What's up, Bobby?  Yeah.  Close.  Yeah.  This is a local truck route over there in Brooklyn.  With a truck, you're lucky if you can get three or four green lights in a row.  Yeah, that's what I was telling Anthony this morning.  Every time the lights turn green for as far as the eye can see, they only let you go about 
[00:10:00]  two, maybe three.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Try doing that in the truck.  Now, when you...  You blow the lights, Reginald Denny.  What the fuck are you trying to do?  I got an 80,000-pound truck.  What do you want from me?  Go.  Hey, uh, yeah, I'll push them into a parked car, no problem.  Exactly.  Like that, a red light?  Yeah.  They'll come up over the double yellow line, side-by-side with you.  If you're the first one at the light, as soon as the light turns green, they bolt out in 
[00:10:30]  front of you.  Well, I got a fairly quick truck.  I don't want to miss around one or two of them into oncoming traffic.  I guess it'll be a lot of fun over there.  Yeah, see, you know what I'm talking about.  I guess a lot of people know, because I guess at that point, there's no highway, so you  have to do this route to get back on the Brooklyn Queens, the BQE there.  Yeah, you probably went all the way over, uh, Linda Boulevard to Fort Hamilton.  Yeah, Brooklyn's a weird area because it's not the grid that you're used to with Manhattan.  Yeah.  You end up on these weird roads that don't take you where you think you're going to end 
[00:11:00]  up.  Right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know the first thing about Brooklyn.  I once visited Anthony there.  That was, that's all I know of Brooklyn.  And I went to Mike Cole's, uh, going away party from the NYPD in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  That's the, that's the only two times I've been to Brooklyn.  So I don't know shit about it.  Yeah.  It's, uh, but there's some, there's some tough areas.  Oof.  Brownsville.  Oh, there's that.  Then I was through the, the bed. 
[00:11:30]  East New York.  Fucking, uh.  Bed-Stuy.  Bed-Stuy.  Flatbush.  How about a little Coney Island action too?  Coney Island.  And not the, the, not the let's have some hot dogs.  No, no.  I have a different word for Coney Island.  I would imagine.  It's a lot of fun to say.  I would imagine.  But.  Change the Coney.  Oh.  Is it really that, is it, is it that simple?  Yes.  Was it that simple?  I didn't say it was creative.  Just said it was fun.  Yes.  Oh, Jerry?  Yes, exactly.  No great ending to the story, but I was fucking screaming at my GPS. 
[00:12:00]  I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.  Really?  Really?  What are you doing to me?  Yeah, what are you doing to me is right.  This computer is fucking me.  And then I remember one of Jim Norton's old bits where you talk about that.  You should be able to enter your race.  Enter your race.  That's right.  Enter your race.  I was trying to remember the punchline to the joke.  That's exactly what it was.  Yeah.  You enter your race before.  It's horrifying.  It was horrifying.  And then you get, I don't know what it is.  You get off a highway and within two lights you feel like you're complete, you can't turn around.  I don't know what that's about. 
[00:12:30]  And I think we all do that, right?  Yeah, I'll forge forward.  You just gotta forge forward and go, no, it's gonna get better at any moment.  So you just keep going forward when the logical thing is to just turn your ass around and get the fuck out of there.  Well, you're afraid to make a right or a left on a side street and spin around.  Oh, I did a side street thing.  I did a side street thing because it was a double lane highway.  You had to be in the right lanes to make the right turn and I'm in the left side.  So now I had to go down a while and then I had to do a loopy loop around the local neighborhood to get back on the horrible fucking Linden Avenue. 
[00:13:00]  You're probably better off with a lot of people being around though.  At least it's a little harder to rob somebody in the ghetto when there's bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Yeah.  Probably better off then than 2 o'clock in the morning.  I saw one Asian guy and everybody else was black.  They were chasing him out of his own store.  One Asian guy.  Sorry for your mother.  One Asian guy in his dumb delivery bike.  Yeah.  Ballsy.  They're very ballsy.  They're constantly getting mugged, those guys.  Very ballsy.  They're constantly getting mugged. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  That's why I travel at least three people in the car.  Me, Heckler, and Koch.  Yes.  H.K.  Who's that?  Oh.  Well, I thought you were going to say Smith-Weson because you never know who you're going to run into in a bad town.  A part of town.  Let's go to Charlie in Staten Island.  Hey, Charlie.  We're the best at visual radio.  Hello?  Hey, Charlie.  Help me out.  Where was I?  Charlie.  Hey, when you got off to Jackie Robinson, you were in East New York, which is Pennsylvania Avenue. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, East New York's not bad.  If you would have continued straight down Pennsylvania, that would have took you to Bell Parkway.  But you made the right, followed your GPS.  You go through the 75, and then you come into the 67, which is like the bottom end of Flatbush.  Yeah.  Which is really not too much better.  Yeah.  From Brooklyn North to Brooklyn South.  Yeah.  Then you go through there, then you come into the 66 Precinct, which is Jewville.  Maimonides Hospital, which is Fort Hamilton Parkway and 58th Street is what you passed. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I saw that.  Go ahead.  Come on.  Yeah, and then you go into the 68 Precinct when you cross over 62nd Street.  That's where Anthony's from.  And Bay Ridge Parkway, and then you're back right on the BQE.  And boom, you're back on.  So he was really in a bad area.  Yes, you were in the worst.  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.  Wow.  I tweeted immediately because I wanted to know exactly how bad.  You see a lot of Popeyes, you're in trouble.  I wouldn't look to the right or the left. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  I mean, out of my eye, just a little bit.  A little peripheral.  You know, make sure no one's knocking on my window with a fucking Glock.  Oh, boy.  You don't want that.  But as soon as I entered Jewy Jew Town, I knew I was on my way.  Yeah.  The Hasidics don't fuck with, I mean, they don't allow anyone to mess with them.  Oh, no.  You should have asked some of the boys to pose for a Twitter photo.  You should have said, could you gentlemen over there pose for a Twitter picture?  Excuse me, boy, could you come over here? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, God, how wrong would that be?  I did reach for my HD flip a couple times.  I'm like, she's going to kill me if I reach for my HD flip right now.  Start videotape.  Filming drug dealers?  Yeah.  That would be great.  We got a six-week gold in the car.  What's wrong?  I said to myself, what's wrong with you?  Let me tweet this.  Fuck the HD flip and fuck Twitter right now.  Get your family out of here.  Opie's eye would look like Moe Green's.  Hey, there you go.  There's a guy who knows the precinct.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  That sounded to me like this guy was just guessing.  Jesus, this guy knew every block.  You go to 6-8, you make a right there by the library.  Oh, no, not library.  Precinct.  There's a dead body laying there last night.  I saw the lights at the Verrazano Bridge.  I was like, oh, okay, thank God.  Get me there.  Just get me there.  It was like the promised land.  Yeah.  How was everyone else's weekend?  That's fun, huh?  Yeah, a good weekend.  Laszlo came over, did a compound show.  That was good.  Nice. 
[00:16:30]  A lot of fun.  Shaking down the system there on Ustream.  Looked good, though.  And Laszlo's always a treat to have down there, drinking some Guinness and laughing.  And then I had the whole damn family over yesterday for Father's Day and pool.  A lot of pool action.  That must be nice.  And the little kids.  It just gets me like when you see the little kids in the pool with the swimmies and it's  like, oh, that's cute. 
[00:17:00]  And then you realize they're wearing diapers.  Yeah, they are.  It's like, oh, God, could you please just make sure nothing's happening in my pool?  I don't want to have to drain it.  Are you kidding?  They're not going to tell you that they're chaining a wet diaper.  You notice they kind of went off by themselves after they got out of the pool to change diapers?  Yeah, I know.  You might have to drain that pool.  The filter's great.  And kids don't have logs yet, so you know there's some seepage.  Oh, God. 
[00:17:30]  If you need to know, I can tell you this stuff now.  I don't need to know.  I'm not even thinking about it.  I don't think kids develop logs until about one, maybe two sometimes.  I'm fucking throwing baseball-sized chlorine things in there.  That's it.  I don't care if I can't go in for a month.  That's it.  Fucking throw in chlorine bath balls.  Bath balls.  Bath balls.  It was funny that the 50 Cal was the centerpiece on my kitchen island where everybody was just congregating and talking. 
[00:18:00]  And there's snacks and chips and pizza.  And yeah, and everyone's eating.  And the 50 Cal is just right in the middle of everything.  And everyone's just kind of chatting about it and opening up the site.  And, you know, drawing trajectory on different buildings and stuff around the house.  You should throw around in there just for the hell of it.  Yeah, just for fun, right?  Why not?  Yeah, sure.  I'll have it blow a hole through the side of your house.  Make sure it's aimed a little high so it doesn't hit any fuckers.  People do like looking through the scope, though, and just going, I bet I could hit that. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Not loaded, obviously.  You know, nothing like that.  You're a safe gun owner.  I try.  And Uncle Joe is one of those fanatics.  He's very, no, Uncle Paul.  Uncle Joe.  He's a guitar builder.  He's very artistic.  I remember Joe.  And he's looking at this thing and just appreciating the machinery that went into it and everything.  And, yeah, all the other uncles coming over looking at it. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, well, that's great.  We'll have to go to the range and fire that thing.  Okay.  But that was it.  It was kind of fun to just have that as the focal point of Father's Day.  You forgot a very special guest you had on Saturday.  Absolutely.  Jimmy Norton.  But it was late.  I was down with my spots.  And I just, I'm like, hey, what are you doing?  He's like, oh, nothing.  So me and my chick went over.  It was just, and we walk in.  It's Ant.  By himself.  What day was this?  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  I was down with my spots.  And there was nobody over. 
[00:19:30]  I figured I had to be a little get-together.  This Ant holding a gun.  The beer.  It's like, come on over.  You always have to have it strapped to your hip.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  And he's like, not nothing.  But I wanted to say, no, not nothing.  This is called unraveling.  Yes, yes, yes.  And there is that fucking thing on his kitchen counter.  It's great slash tragic.  There's no way around it.  No, I loved it.  I was like, this is fucking, this is so great. 
[00:20:00]  But it's just, nobody normal does this for real.  No, it is like, yeah.  It's a little strange.  Anti-light armor.  There's Jimmy's picture that he's Twittered.  It's pretty much, yeah, for light armored vehicles.  Jesus is right.  And it was fun.  And we went in the pool and the jacuzzi, which is nice and warm now.  I want a retraction from the earlier gazpacho soup.  It was almost uncomfortably hot.  I couldn't enjoy it.  Now it's too hot.  It was too warm.  Now it's just too hot. 
[00:20:30]  It really was nice.  Fucking 30 leaks I took.  Minimum, 30 leaks.  So that's worse than the kids, probably.  Oh, what are you going to do?  You want to learn about poo in the pool?  And Greg in DC's got it for you.  Great.  Good morning, Greg.  Good morning, Greg.  Yeah, I'm a teacher during the regular year, and now I run a pool all summer.  And, you know, the urine in the pool, not a big deal.  Everybody's okay with urine.  But even a little bit of shit leaks out of one of those wonderful children's diapers. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  And you can get pink eye to start with.  You can get minor infections in your hands all the way up to these wonderful skin diseases  that create nasty rashes all the way around your entire body.  It's a little bit of shit.  It's looking at his body right now.  I'm good.  I'm sure that...  If you had a single cut on a couple parts of your body and shit leaked out of those diapers,  you run the risk of getting these nice little rashes. 
[00:21:30]  We didn't give the kid chili and throw him in the fucking pool.  He's fucking...  He thought of what was happening.  I have a very nice filtration system and cleansing system on the pool.  If you don't know about the...  What's technically called a brownout, which for you would mean a pool in Stollerfeld in your pool.  I don't like the sound of brownout anyway.  Well, actually, I'm sure you'd love to hearing it say brownout, brownout. 
[00:22:00]  But that was awful.  I knew he said, dude.  Yeah, he knows it was awful.  You're not going to get him on that one.  And if you know that somebody does shit in your pool even a little bit,  you have to increase the chlorine output in that pool by four times for at least eight hours.  Yeah, that's not a problem.  And just for you, it might even be safe.  Seriously, all kidding aside, to increase the chlorine output before the kids even get in it.  Yeah, no one said anything. 
[00:22:30]  Believe me, it was my brother and sister's kids.  My brother or sister would have been like, oh, something happened in the pool there.  I strained out as much as I can.  And lobbed a few fucking grenade rounds into the fucking pool.  Yeah.  I took the strainer.  I got most of it out.  But I don't know.  You might want to do something after everyone leaves.  All right.  Nasty.  I run a lot of kids playing it all summer.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, Mr. Doom and Gloom.  All right.  Yeah, this guy. 
[00:23:00]  Well, Ann knows what his 50 cal could do, sir.  Cody and PA, go ahead.  Good morning, boys.  I have a question for Anthony.  Yes, sir.  As a Marine specialist, I'm kind of curious with the high power round of the 50 caliber.  Yeah.  Do you know it can plunge through 36 inches of reinforced concrete?  That's fantastic.  And a 16th of titanium at 1,000 yards.  Isn't that great?  I got a big piece of fucking armored car glass that I'm going to take down and shoot it with  various calibers, a 9, a 40, a 45, and then the Desert Eagle, and then I'm going to hit 
[00:23:30]  it with the M107 and see what the fuck, how that destroys it.  It will destroy it.  I'm just curious.  When are you going to start the war?  I don't plan on starting it, my friend, but I plan on being there at the end.  I'll join you, sir.  Have a good day.  Last whitey standing, motherfucker.  There you go.  Lots happened over the weekend.  We're going to start with Eddie in St. Louis. 
[00:24:00]  Eddie, go ahead, sir.  I'm sure you want to talk sports.  Eddie.  What's up, Eddie?  USA got completely fucked out of a goal, and it can mean the difference between us moving  on in the World Cup or getting knocked out.  Yeah, we certainly did get fucked.  For the people that do care about soccer, it was a bad, bad call.  It was a Jim Joyce type of call for the U.S.  Oh, that bad?  Oh, yeah.  The funny thing about it is that Joe Matchnick, the guy who used to be in charge of all the  game officials and MLS, said that he saw at least three fouls on the U.S. during that 
[00:24:30]  play.  So I don't know what the fuck happened, but obviously we have to win the next game or this  complicated match.  Well, it's not obvious to everyone.  It's obvious to the people that are following the World Cup and the U.S.  I'm saying they're corrupt.  I'm saying the officials and everything are very anti-American, very corrupt.  They would not want America to move on, so they will do these things.  We're used to officials being held accountable.  Even with shitty calls, they're at least called out. 
[00:25:00]  People say that's a shitty call.  In soccer, they're just like, no, fuck you.  This is what we do.  Think there's no way to protest or anything?  No, no.  The U.S. came back from a two-zip deficit, which is amazing.  Was it a last-second goal, Eddie?  It was in the 85th minute.  85th minute, so the game's winding down, and they score, and they said, no goal.  No goal.  What was the foul they said?  It was some kind of phantom foul that no one could really figure out, right, Eddie?  Phantom foul?  I've gone back and I've watched that tape about 15 times, and there was nothing going 
[00:25:30]  on.  Like I said, there was three fouls on U.S. players, but absolutely nothing.  You know, on us against them.  And the guy, Bradley, who's the coach, his son plays, and he looked like he was going  fucking nuts.  Yeah.  I mean, he was screaming at that referee.  And I mean, you know, I'm glad I didn't get a technical or anything, but it's just a  shame that there's no objective way to give us the goal.  And obviously no instant replay in World Cup?  No.  Why?  I honestly don't understand.  They only have to look at like three plays a game. 
[00:26:00]  There's only like ten total plays a game.  A little slow the game down?  You mean like the game?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the only good thing about it is that we still control our own destiny.  We're going to play Algeria next, and we have to beat them.  Or if we end the game in a tie, then England has to lose or tie, but we still have more  goals in England, so we'll move on to the next stage.  But if U.S. wins on Wednesday, they're in, right?  To the next round?  Okay.  I think it sucks in any way.  That's why.  A dumb sport.  A lot of people seem to be watching.  Now I'm glad the whole country can see exactly the fucking anti-U.S. sentiment. 
[00:26:30]  Why would we be involved in that shit fucking world?  This is what happens if you compete with the rest of the world.  They hate us.  Fuck them.  Fuck the rest of the world.  I think the ratings are pretty good for World Cup in this country for some reason.  I mean, I'm not watching, but I'm taking a peek, as I like to say.  So, thanks, Eddie.  Thank you.  And they wouldn't ban the horns.  No, no.  Right, Eddie?  Maybe they wouldn't ban the horns?  Well, I mean, I'm one of these guys that hates them, but no, they're not going to ban 
[00:27:00]  them.  Do you have any idea how much money they're making selling those things?  Can you imagine?  I love the fact that that's that.  Because now it's become the thing.  Because the media got on it, so now more people are buying the horns.  Oh, you know something, actually?  The other day they had a baseball game between the Marlins and the Rays, and they handed those  shits out at the stadium.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And some of the players actually had earplugs in their ears.  Yeah.  They decided it would be a good idea, because there's Vuvuzela, that's how we're pronouncing  it.  Yeah, Vuvuzela, but we say Vuvuzela.  How do you say it for real?  Vuvuzela.  Vuvuzela. 
[00:27:30]  Vuvuzela?  Vuvuzela.  Vuvuzela?  We say Vuvuzela.  Vuvuzela.  Because it just sounds funnier that way.  It sounds more normal to say Vuvuzela.  I like the story that, was Travis sent it, about the woman that blew out her fucking voice  box?  Yeah, they were having some kind of a Vuvuzela, what, blowing contest?  Blowing contest?  Blowing contest, and I guess her fucking larynx flew out of the front of it.  Nice.  Fucker.  Good for you.  Blood pouring out of it.  Good.  Stupid Major League Baseball, the Marlins decided, yeah, to hand out a smaller version of these 
[00:28:00]  horns.  Did anyone see the game or highlights?  Was the audio obnoxious?  That must have been terrible.  There's no way in hell that you could be able to have any type of on-field communication  with that going on.  I mean, I don't know who came up with that, but they ought to be fired.  Well, they were just trying to get caught up in the whole Vuvuzela movement, you know.  A Vuvuzela movement.  All right, Eddie.  And Manu Bull died over the weekend, who, by the way, was the most overrated player to  ever play in the NBA.  He was the only player in NBA history that had more blocked shots than points. 
[00:28:30]  He was terrible.  He was horrendous, but people...  He was 18 feet tall.  He was 7'7", I think.  And his arms were, like, ridiculously longer than anyone.  It was the little Vuvuzelas.  He averaged 2.6 points a game and 3.3 rebounds, I think, was his average.  He was horrible.  He could be right under the net with the ball, and he couldn't fucking get in the hoop.  And he had a skin disease that he caught from his medication.  Oh, my God.  I have got...  I'm watching this clip of the Marlins game with the Vuvuzelas that they handed out, and 
[00:29:00]  all you see are disgusted people plugging their ears.  The umps with the earplugs in.  The pitcher was putting earplugs in.  How annoying.  Why would they do that?  Publicity stunt?  Of course.  Baseball's always looking for some kind of publicity thing.  Exactly.  In case an umpire blows a guy's perfect game, in that case, Bud Seeland puts his fucking 
[00:29:30]  head up his old asshole and rolls in a circle and does nothing.  Fuck it.  I'm still pissed off by that.  All sports stink.  Ridiculous.  But this Manute Ball, yeah, yeah, Jimmy's got it.  He averaged what?  2.6 points a game and 3.3 rebounds.  He's 7'7".  He averaged 2.6 points a game.  Anything under 200 points a game is shit when you're that tall.  It's a bum.  The most overrated player.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  And then when he fought the fridge, he fought the fridge. 
[00:30:00]  He looked like a praying mantis.  Yeah.  Did he get killed?  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was the most boring fight I've ever seen.  Yeah.  I don't know what happened with that fight.  Who could tell who won?  He had a horrible skin disease on his mouth.  He caught from his kidney medication in Africa or something.  Oh, really?  Where he was like, yeah, he couldn't eat for 11 days because your skin peels off and you  can't talk.  Look up the disease he had, Sam.  I want to see a picture of it.  Oh, I bet I don't.  It's probably like having a chapped skin around your lips.  Oh, my God.  But he had a fucking rough, he had a very painful skin disease. 
[00:30:30]  He ought to be the new Celtics mascot.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  What does that mean, Eddie?  That means the Celtics sucked and they died.  Oh, yeah.  Celtics fucking had a great game seven in L.A.  What are you talking about?  That was a night.  I did watch a lot of that game.  What are you talking about?  Celtics.  All that matters is who wins, gentlemen.  I understand that in the end, but the Celtics, you know, game seven in L.A., the odds were stacked  against them and they had a fine game.  I couldn't believe that both Doc Rivers was talking after the game about how, you know, we haven't 
[00:31:00]  had a chance to truly defend our title.  I mean, give me a fucking break with that.  Yeah, well.  What did he say?  Basic, well, I forget the name of the guy who was out.  There was one of the key players in the Celtics who wasn't in that game, but Rivers was like,  you know, we don't feel like we've had a true chance to defend our title, which is just  bullshit.  I mean, if you look at it, if the Celtics wouldn't have got greedy and started throwing  up all these fucking three-point bricks, they would have just tried to maintain.  I mean, they would have won that game handily.  Right on.  They gave it away.  Right on.  Wait, is that him?  No, that's not Manu Paul. 
[00:31:30]  That's the disease.  God.  We're looking at a picture of another gentleman with the Manu Paul skin disease.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  Yes.  What the fuck?  What do you get that from?  How do you get that?  And who do I kiss?  You get that from the NYPD.  It looks like.  That looks like he was bludgeoned about the face.  His mouth looks so sore.  You get that from your GPS system.  Imagine taking you the wrong way.  Oh, my God.  Imagine having to eat, like, hot buffalo wings with that disease. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, how that would hurt.  With some lemonade.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Brad Buckwalter from D.C. reminds me today that Manu Paul did try to play minor league hockey.  That is the truth.  Really?  Yes, he did.  He was a stick.  He needed to pay some bills, so he would do all that freak show stuff for everybody.  Damn.  He did the fight.  Yeah.  Did the boxing match, and that's right.  He tried to play minor league hockey.  I think someone, I don't know, hired him or whatever for a couple games. 
[00:32:30]  So how do you get that disease there, Sam?  Anyone know?  I don't know.  I hope it's one of those that you can only get, like, if you're over there.  You know what?  Oh, that reminds me of a commercial that comes on for, I had the dengue fever.  I got dengue fever.  It is an ache that you feel all over.  And it's like, who the fuck is getting dengue fever, and why are they allowed in this country?  And it's a commercial for it?  Yes.  I haven't seen that one yet.  The dengue fever.  Your joints feel like they are on fire. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, and it's these third world diseases that they want us to do research for, because  now that we're letting in more people, because we're just a wonderful nation, we're also  letting in these shit diseases, like dengue fever.  The fuck is that?  You get that on the Mekong Delta.  Oh, there you go, Jimmy.  That's your disease right there.  It's terrible.  What do we got on it?  It's called...  This is what Manu Paul had with the skin thing, with his own mouth being swallowed. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, it's just Stevens-Johnson, or whatever it is, is pretty much what it's called.  It's the same thing.  You get it from barbiturates and penicillins.  It's an allergic thing.  Allergic reaction that occurs in response to medications, infections, or illness.  Yes, medications include barbiturates, penicillins, phenot...  What is that one?  Phenotone?  Phenotone.  Toine.  And sulfa...  Sulfanamids.  All right.  Is it...  Is it curable?  Does it go away? 
[00:34:00]  Or is it forever?  Yeah, when you die.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  He won't have it for long.  Well, what killed Manu Paul?  Kidneys, right?  Kidneys, I think, yeah.  Really?  I thought it was that.  Yeah, well, there you go.  The most overrated player to ever play.  He was supposed to be a real humanitarian, like he was always trying to help the shitty  Sudan, which is where he was from, I guess.  That was just guilt.  It can cause all of it.  I work in a burn center, actually, and we treat it just like we would a third-degree burn. 
[00:34:30]  So it's poltergeist?  Can you stop it?  No, there's really no stopping it.  Most people die from it.  Oh, really?  I'm not touching anybody.  That's it.  I don't want that.  What exactly is it that's happening, though, when you get it?  Like, what is an allergic reaction to a medicine?  Basically.  It's mostly from, like, Bactrim, which would be used for urinary tract infections.  Or...  I'm going to have it hurt when I piss.  Yeah, fuck it.  I'd rather have it burn.  Yeah.  Take the burn. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, and we treat it as a burn.  It gets pretty wicked.  How long does it take to start happening?  It starts out as, like, a rash.  It does in everything.  Yeah, and then it spreads pretty quick.  It does in everything.  And there's no way to stop it or just to slow it down?  Well, I mean, we treat it as a burn.  We do a lot of, like, fluid challenges, that kind of thing.  And we treat it like a burn.  It's just pretty bad.  I've seen people die from it within, like, 72 hours.  I don't want that.  Wow, I never want to get that. 
[00:35:30]  Stop it.  Help me.  I don't want that thing.  No, thank you.  There's so many awful things you can get.  Yeah.  I don't like it.  Well, you're smart to just be a recluse, Ant.  Oh.  You're better off that way.  Stay in my shit pool.  Stay in the compound.  My kid's shit pool.  Shit pool's the safest place to be.  It's turning out.  I love you guys.  All right, Amy.  Thank you.  John was actually at the baseball game with the Vavuzelas.  Hi, Chad.  John, what do you got on the Vavuzelas at that damn baseball game? 
[00:36:00]  Oh, hey, Owen.  Happy birthday, Amy.  Hey.  Man, those things are.  I'm an avid soccer fan for years.  Taking it at the soccer game is one thing.  You can block it out.  But when you're sitting there trying to relax, sit back at a game, you know,  a great pastime, these things are blasting behind you.  You're telling people to please just be quiet.  I'm ready to leave by the third inning.  Not only that, but every between innings, the organ comes on,  and you hear da-da-da-da-da-da, and these things are. 
[00:36:30]  Do we have sound?  Yeah, there's got to be some audio.  Did you guys get sound down the hall?  There's got to be audio of that.  Because it's one thing to hear this at the World Cup,  but we all know baseball, obviously.  I want to hear what it sounds like at a baseball game.  Try and get the live coverage from the color commentators.  Yeah, it's got to be online somewhere.  It's on TV, and this thing is just blasting while they're talking,  and you can hear that they're just irritated with these lousy things.  Plus, the Marlins are doing whatever they can to get fans in the stands.  Yeah, that'll do it. 
[00:37:00]  Just make a horrible noise.  Yeah.  Yeah, come make some noise for everyone.  It's not soccer, guys.  It's baseball.  I'll take it at the soccer games.  I'll chant.  There's no way I'm sitting at a game to listen to these stupid horns.  As much as you hated it, very smart on their part.  Everyone's talking about how the Vavuzlo was at a baseball game.  Vavuzlo.  Well, try and find out how much more people showed up at the stands this one game alone.  Yeah, we'll see.  Compared to their average, I don't think it's by much.  I'm sure it was a successful promotion for the Marlins. 
[00:37:30]  But the problem is, it's setting a precedent where other baseball fucking games,  you're going to hear the Vavuzlo horns.  They kicked the one guy out of Yankee Stadium, didn't he?  He brought one to Yankee Stadium.  They kicked him out, right?  We had that story last week?  Yeah, I took it off, bro.  All right.  Some old World War II air raid siren day.  How about that?  Those ones you crank.  You'd have to buy two seats, though.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  One for you and one for your horn.  One for your air raid siren.  Yeah.  How annoying of a game would that be to be at?  Oh, fuck.  We missed the obvious with the skin disease.  Kenny in Jersey, what do you got on that?  Not much.  Yes, I'd like to admit that I infected Manute Bull's mouth with my Johnson,  Stevens Johnson.  Oh, I got it.  That's funny.  It's Stevens Johnson disease?  Is that what it is?  Yes, it is.  Yes.  He's got the evil. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, we got the vuvuzla at the Rays-Morlins game.  Thank you, Sam.  Let's listen to this.  He's on deck.  He had a two-run double against Robertson, and the Rays had a two-nothing lead.  Begna fights off that fastball.  Oh, my God.  There's no one there.  There's still no one there.  Thank God.  And those are the mini-vuvuzlas.  How fucking annoying, though. 
[00:39:00]  And there's no one there.  There's no one there.  Yeah, well, that's their idea of getting people in the park.  Yeah.  Instead of getting a good team together, get the most annoying sound known to man and give  it to people.  Assholes.  I was reading, uh...  Six hits and 46 RBIs.  And he pops him up.  Hanley out.  Coglin in.  Uh-oh.  And Chris gets it.  Oh.  A swarm of bees. 
[00:39:30]  That's right.  Act like it's fun.  The answer can't even be honest.  Yeah, look at that.  They all have just mini-vuvuzlas, and everyone's just blowing them in the stands.  Oh, shove them up their asses.  Who gives a shit game, and no one's fucking there?  I was reading about baseball yesterday and how the service charges are killing the average  fan, where it's getting completely ridiculous.  You know what costs you $2.50 just to print up your own tickets to a baseball game?  Like, you're using your own shit.  Yeah, what's the paper?  You're using your own shit to print up your fucking tickets, and you have to pay for that. 
[00:40:00]  Why?  Makes no sense.  How does that make sense?  What's their argument?  It was in the New York paper yesterday.  They talked about all the surcharges that are just completely out of hand now.  Completely.  And the main one was, yeah, charging $2.50 to print up your own tickets.  How do they logically get away?  What's the explanation for that?  They should take money off because you're doing it yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  You're not using any of their services.  You're doing them a favor.  They don't have to hire as many people.  God, it's just fucking... 
[00:40:30]  If someone could find that article from yesterday, because they kind of listed all the charges,  and we've known this for years, that it's knocking the average fan out of the game.  It's terrible, man.  It just makes me hate the sport more than ever.  It really does.  I've come to fucking hate all of them.  For a who-gives-a-shit baseball game, it's costing way too much money.  Way too fucking much money.  $2.50 to print your own tickets?  Maybe some of these who-gives-a-shit games, they should drop the prices, right? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Get people in.  Get people in.  Get people loyal and enjoying the games.  Right.  And then fuck them.  Why don't you do such money?  Dick-em-wants-to-there.  Yeah, I realize I'm just not a baseball fan anymore.  I mean, you had the Subway Series, the Mets and Yankees.  I tell people I'm a Mets fan, but I'm not really a Mets fan.  I'm really not a Mets fan.  No.  I don't think I could name the starting lineup right now.  I don't think I could do it.  I didn't even know there was a Subway Series unless I saw something to the Subway Series.  Yeah.  Because I was down in Philly, and everyone's like, oh, Mets, Yankees, who do you got? 
[00:41:30]  I'm like, I guess I said Mets.  Because I had a habit.  I go, I'm going for the Mets.  And then I realized, wait a minute, man, I just don't follow baseball anymore.  Cody.  Lady Gaga made big stink there.  Oh, yeah, what happened with Lady Gaga?  The Lady Gaga.  She was at a Mets game, and now she's at a Yankees game.  She was at the Yankees game, and then she was in the clubhouse, in the Yankees clubhouse,  wearing nothing but her bra, panties, and an open Yankees jersey.  And she was shaking her tits, like, feeling her tits.  That would be so great if she was hoss. 
[00:42:00]  So she's allowed to games, but she has been banned from the clubhouse.  For doing that?  Yeah, I guess they were a little upset that the Yankees had lost that game.  They just went out and said, now she's not banned, because they didn't want all the publicity.  She just said they had bad timing, but celebrities are still welcome,  and she still can come into the clubhouse, but not after a loss.  Yeah, it was after a loss, and she was really flaunting her panties and bra.  Good, that's what you want to see after you lose.  Lady Gaga.  Fat pussy.  Of course. 
[00:42:30]  It makes you forget that you lost the game.  What, are you supposed to want to look at the guy from WPIX interviewing you?  What happened with three and two count?  I'd rather look at her fat pussy bobbling out like a fucking catcher's mitt.  Nice to share a grand slam home run.  Yesterday, the Mets losing the game.  The Yankees now in sole possession of first play.  Is she a Yankee fan or a Mets fan?  She's a Yankee fan.  Oh, all right.  Well, it's better than seeing Sabathia get out of the fucking showers.  Yeah, she did look pretty fucking good with the little panties and bra. 
[00:43:00]  She does very well with what she's got.  That Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  It costs extra to pre-print your movie tickets at home, too, Booger Couch says.  They just fuck us at every turn.  This fucking society we live in, they just fuck us at every turn.  How are they charging us extra to print up our movie tickets?  How does that make sense?  That makes no sense.  And we just deal with it, because what can you do? 
[00:43:30]  That's like, does it cost more to do the self-checkout at, like, Home Depot or something?  I'm sure they'll figure out some kind of service charge for doing that.  I bet you.  Why would it cost more?  You're not paying an employee.  NFL charges to print your own tickets, too.  I did not know that was going on.  And when you go to check out your tickets, it'll say, ticket fast, print them out now,  parentheses, recommended, and it's in yellow.  So it's like, you really want to do this.  And then if you scroll all the way down, you can go, standard mail, free. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, really?  And that's what I always choose.  They'll just mail you your tickets for free.  But the first option is to print them at home for $2.50.  That's how they get you.  So, okay.  That's unbelievable.  I had no idea.  It actually costs them more to mail the tickets.  Of course.  Yes.  Of course.  To print them out, they throw a bunch of other stuff in there.  They have to print you a receipt.  And then they have to mail them.  And that's free.  They're just fucking you.  Until people stop going to games.  And just go, you know what?  Fuck you. 
[00:44:30]  They will continue to fuck you people.  I think we're just stuck as a society, though.  So silent.  What are we supposed to do, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, people will always fill the seats up.  If the team's good, people aren't going to unite against baseball and not show up.  Not against them.  Watch it on TV.  But why would you?  Because it's free.  Why would you go there?  And they have a right to charge you for a good product.  But why would you go there and just get, like, anyone that's charging you to print out your own tickets, they are just fucking you. 
[00:45:00]  It is disgusting.  You're right.  It's terrible.  It's horrible.  We're going to learn a little bit more about Manute Bull from someone that lives in the D.C. area.  Manute Bull spent a lot of time in the D.C. area.  Didn't he, John?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  Hey, you know, years ago, they used to have these firehouse casinos outside of D.C.  And they'd go in there to play blackjack or whatever.  And this guy would walk in like the biggest degenerate gambler.  I mean, besides Anthony, of course.  Of course.  And he'd take up the whole table by himself. 
[00:45:30]  And we'd sit there, and he's sitting in the anchor spot.  And he'd be able to place all seven bets with these fucking manned his fucking arms.  His giant arms and his crusty mouth.  He was a degenerate gambler this minute, Paul?  John's saying this.  I have no idea.  It was sad.  It was just kind of after he washed out playing basketball, he still was in the area.  And over this progression of time, he'd go in, bet, you know, $100 a hand.  And by the end of the year, he's playing nickels and looked like he was sucking dick for beer money. 
[00:46:00]  It was awful.  How do you wash out as an NBA player at 7'7"?  I know.  He died at 47 years old.  He should have been playing in the NBA this year if you're 7'7".  He was all fucked up, though.  He couldn't even walk.  He sucked.  Those knobby knees just fucking all fucked up.  He could block some shots, great.  But he couldn't score, ever.  All right, boys.  Hey, Tiger sucks, by the way.  Yeah, Tiger just couldn't get it done at the U.S. Open. 
[00:46:30]  I know you didn't watch the golf I watched.  Travis watched.  Some guy was flying a plane overhead that said, Tiger, who's your daddy?  Or some shit like that.  Oh, they did that shit again?  Just drafting him, yeah.  Nah, he just, he's just not getting it done yet, man.  He was kind of blaming his caddy in the paper today.  Really?  Yep.  Yep, his caddy didn't give him the right club or was suggesting a club that he knew just wasn't going to work.  Get over here.  I'll sign your card.  I think what's going to happen with Tiger Woods, he's going to reinvent himself. 
[00:47:00]  I think he's going to get rid of Steve Williams.  Yeah.  In the paper today, he's hinting that his caddy might be a problem, and maybe it's time to just reinvent himself,  get a new caddy, and move forward.  Yeah.  Didn't this guy kind of stand by him?  Winning that caddy tournament.  That's important.  Steve Williams came out and said, look, man, I want to make this perfectly clear.  I had no fucking idea he was fucking all these women.  He was sort of pissed about that whole thing.  That's probably so Elon didn't make Tiger fire him, too.  Like, he knew?  Get rid of him.  That might have been one of the reasons, too. 
[00:47:30]  Who knows?  It's hard to believe that your caddy didn't know.  Gordon wasn't giving him any of the fucking scrubs that he could have passed on.  I don't know if he's a family man and all that.  I don't know what his deal was, but he came out and said, look, man, I had no fucking idea.  I was as clueless as everybody else.  The U.S. Open was played at Pebble Beach.  It was quite a tournament.  Pebble Beach.  And everybody was in it yesterday, and they all just fell apart.  Yeah.  Except for McDowell, who ended up winning it. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, the first guy, European, what, in 40 years to win?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Graham McDowell.  Oi.  He had Ernie Els.  Good old timer up there.  He had a shot.  Tiger had a shot.  I mean, Tiger came in fourth or fifth, I think.  He tied with Phil for fourth.  Yeah.  So all he had to do was shoot an average round, and he would have won the fucking U.S. Open yesterday,  as Tiger Woods.  And then he had this Dustin Johnson.  What a story, man.  He had a three-stroke lead going into the final round yesterday.  I looked at my father-in-law yesterday. 
[00:48:30]  We were down there in Philly.  I go, watch.  This fucking guy's going to choke.  And sure enough, he had a horrendous final round.  He shot an 82, Anthony.  Yikes.  He went from three strokes in the lead, leading into the final round, to five strokes out of  it.  You just should not do that on the final round.  But he was too young and too inexperienced.  I knew he was going to fall apart.  That's standing there, and instead of concentrating on your shot, all you're saying is, oh, my  God, I can't believe I'm in the lead. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going to do that.  Oh, I fucked up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Second hole, he takes a seven.  That's a triple bogey for the people that don't know.  Three strokes over.  And then the next hole, I think it was, he loses his ball.  In the U.S. Open, with everybody watching every shot you do, they still couldn't find his  fucking ball.  They couldn't find it?  They ended up finding it, but it was after the time limit.  So, he still had to take a penalty.  He just had the, he had the worst fucking collapse.  One of the worst collapse ever in golf, so. 
[00:49:30]  So, maybe it'll be a bad year of tournaments.  He had to get out of his system.  Tiger?  Yeah, he had to come back.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I mean, he dominated this course 10 years ago.  He destroyed the competition.  So, him coming in fourth, I mean, he's right there.  I mean, yeah.  So, is he done now for this tournament?  Yeah, this, this is another major.  He wants to win his, he really cares about the majors, obviously.  And this is another major that's gone for this year that he did not win. 
[00:50:00]  So, two more majors this year.  What's left?  British Open and the PGA.  Right, Travis?  That's all we got left.  Yeah, that's it.  So, what is it?  U.S. Open, PGA, British Open, and what else?  And Masters.  Oh, okay.  At Augusta.  Those are the four?  At Augusta, yes.  And that's the big record.  Because Jack's got that record.  Has he won all of them?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got, I think, 15 he's up to, I think.  15 major titles there.  Travis, help me out.  What's the record? 
[00:50:30]  Jack's got, what's Jack up to, 19?  It's getting close.  But Tiger hasn't won in a while.  But isn't he a lot younger than Nicholas, too?  Oh, yeah.  Nicholas is done.  Nicholas is in his 60s.  How many more years of golf does he have?  Tiger's got a good, solid 10 years of competitive golf.  Would that be the same age, Nicholas?  Could he win four more majors in 10 years?  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Easily.  Easily.  Easily.  Easily. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  All right, you want to take our first break?  Yeah, I'm looking at my sammage.  We got to talk about Van der Sloot.  We got to talk about the BP guy.  Van der Sloot.  This guy just, ugh, shoot him already.  Huh?  Enough with him.  Well, now he's saying he confessed because he was scared.  Yeah, he was under pressure and scared.  Well, we'll get into the latest with him.  That's when you confess, dummy.  And then you got BP guy enjoying a little yacht race while his company's destroying our golf.  Yeah.  People are not happy about that.  And then it upset a yacht of people. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, Jeff.  But then there's people not happy with Obama because Obama's playing golf while the golf's being destroyed.  Yeah.  He's playing golf as the golf is being destroyed.  Obama.  Bap, bap, ba-dap.  Boo!  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  We're here. 
[00:52:00]  We're here.  We're here.  We're here.  Remember when STP kind of sounded like Pearl Jam?  And then they found their own sound.  Yeah, their niche.  But at first, you're like, whoa, who's this fucking Pearl Jam ripoff? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  And the video kind of looked very Pearl Jam-ish.  A little bit.  For Plush, I guess it was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he kind of was making Eddie Vedderish faces with his eyes and being all weird.  I fucking hate STP now because of Scott.  Scott's an asshole.  Scott Wyweyland?  I don't even.  Wyweyland?  I don't even blame the DeLeo brothers.  They're very cool guys. 
[00:53:00]  But your lead singer is a fucking asshole.  I wish nothing but the worst for that band at this point.  Ooh, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Eric, Kansas City.  What's going on?  Eddie?  Hey, guys.  What's going on today?  Got some sobering news from the conspiracy realm, the land of tinfoil hats, for you guys.  I'll try to sum it up the best I can.  And basically, you guys are familiar with the show Jericho and the movie The Patriot and 
[00:53:30]  the new movie that just came out straight to DVD with Samuel L. Jackson, Unthinkable.  Does everything ring a bell there?  You do realize it's Monday, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let me put it a different way.  We like to keep it light and fucking fluffy, like a fucking nice omelet on a Monday.  I'll put it a different way.  A year ago, there was a rumor going around that there was going to be this Operation Blackjack,  and it was going to install martial law and mass chaos across America, and it was like 
[00:54:00]  this photo slideshow on a British newspaper site, and it was debunked.  Nothing happened.  You do realize yesterday was Father's Day, right?  Wasn't he just talking about Samuel L. Jackson's movie or something, and now he's switched and  talks about some conspiracy?  What did you call to talk about?  Crazy movie propaganda conspiracies?  What do you want?  Okay.  In the movie The Patriot, it foreshadowed 9-11. 
[00:54:30]  That movie came out in 2000.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  It came out in 2000.  Uh-huh.  Three minutes and 13 seconds into the movie, Mel Gibson's standing there hanging a chair  on a weight, and he says, 9 pounds, 11 ounces.  Then the chair crashes to the ground and breaks in a thousand pieces.  This movie Unthinkable that just came out on DVD on June 15th is about three bombs going  off in the country.  and how terrorism and waterboarding and torture is okay and Samuel L. Jackson. 
[00:55:00]  What are the three bombs, besides this phone call being one of them?  I tried to find it, Jimmy, on the internet, and I couldn't find the location while I was  looking it up.  I don't know that it was ever actually set.  So in The Patriot, 9 pounds, 11 ounces.  11 ounces.  Then the chair falls.  Okay.  But now in this Unthinkable, the trailer came out on DVD on June 15th.  In the trailer, there's a timer on a bomb, and it says six days, 13 hours, and 27 minutes. 
[00:55:30]  Well, if you go from the time they released it to today, that matches up with that day  exactly.  So we've got to look for bombs today.  Today's bomb day?  What if the bombs...  But not only that, but there's one more thing to it.  Yeah.  The TV show Jericho, there was an episode, it was actually the 13th episode, and it was  actually called Blackjack.  And in the camera, it catches this 226 perfectly in the lower left corner of the screen when 
[00:56:00]  they're evacuating all the people after this catastrophe.  And if you put the date backwards like they do in the UK, that's the same date as today,  226.  You know what is odd, though, that he's saying this?  As I was driving in today, I come over that hill, and I just see Manhattan and stuff, and  I looked and noticed it was very clear, very blue skies, and I just started thinking. 
[00:56:30]  I was like, I actually did.  Don't start thinking that shit.  I actually did start thinking.  Because that's how it looked on 9-11.  I know what you're getting at.  I was like, what a beautiful day over in New York, and then I was just like, oh, it's  one of those days that something bad happens.  Uh-oh.  So something bad has to happen today or tomorrow, right?  Well, ostensibly, it's supposed to happen today, so we'll see.  It could happen tomorrow.  I forgot my iPhone.  That's a big disaster.  So if nothing happens today or tomorrow, this whole phone call is a waste of time and you're 
[00:57:00]  full of shit.  Yeah.  Well, you can look it up on YouTube.  I'm asking, is that true?  Google it.  If nothing happens today or tomorrow, then you're full of shit.  Well, I'll make one final prediction.  Oh, right.  We will be at war with Iran July 11th, because they got a thing with the number 11, for some  reason.  Do you really believe in that horse shit with numbers?  Hey, man, the Patriot thing is a little scary with Mel Gibson.  Wait, because it's not? 
[00:57:30]  Hold on.  Nine pounds, 11 ounces.  Because something is nine pounds, 11 ounces and a chair falls in a movie from 10 years  ago?  Yes.  What the hell?  Would you agree that it's a home?  It's no coincidence.  It doesn't even make me go, humph.  None.  Not even a little.  None.  The movie that came out in 2000 called The Patriot had a thing about nine pounds, 11  ounces.  It means nothing.  If you're looking for coincidences, you will find them.  It means nothing, sir.  Yeah.  It's absolutely, if that chair weighed four pounds, 311 ounces, it would have the exact 
[00:58:00]  same emotional impact on me.  311 ounces.  And the movie trailer you're talking about was released over two months ago, not six days  ago.  Well, I don't know.  It was released on DVD.  So you're exhausting yourself.  Just relax.  And what do you got there, Sam?  That's the trailer.  It says six days.  And this trailer was posted April 11th, 2010.  So the six days have passed.  When it came out on DVD.  It came out on DVD. 
[00:58:30]  Wait.  So we have to figure out the day it came out on DVD and then six days after the DVD release  is today.  So the terrorism is planned around the director's cut?  What are you talking about?  What happens if they had delayed it?  What if it's based on the HBO release?  You sure you got it all correct?  Hey, I don't know.  They have delayed the release.  Now what do we do?  What?  The Bilderberg group wasn't real a couple years ago either, according to the media.  Now look at it.  What?  The Bilderberg? 
[00:59:00]  Not the Bilder.  Bilderberger is what you do when you go to, like, Burger King.  You can build your own burger.  Jackson Hole.  Bilderberg is something different.  Yeah, you know, it's just a group of the most powerful people in the world.  Or you can go to BilderBear.  It's where the kids make their own bear.  It's adorable.  Yes.  You have a party.  Yeah, so build a bear party.  So everyone's saying today's the 21st, not the 22nd.  So, Eric, do we have to wait until tomorrow?  Yeah, what day is it?  What's going to happen?  Come on. 
[00:59:30]  I think it's supposed to be late to today.  And what's going to happen today?  I don't know.  Dirty bomb.  What do we got?  Dirty bomb?  Dude, what if after the show today we're all just in our own little worlds and also in our Twitter's or something go off with some horrendous fucking bomb explosion?  I will fucking, oh, will I just go and find him?  Yeah.  I don't want it to happen either.  Believe me.  All right.  So what do we, all right.  Could you please summarize?  Because it's Monday.  The Patriot, nine pounds, 11 ounces, and a chair falls. 
[01:00:00]  So that meant that 9-11 was supposed to happen.  Right.  Because the Twin Towers resembled a big chair.  Yeah.  In a movie about the 1700s.  Right.  Well, I mean, if you follow anything about conspiracy theory or anybody listens to, you know, guys like Alex Jones, the theory is that the Illuminati, the people in charge, they have this thing with the occult or whatever that they like to tell you what they're going to do before they do it.  Why?  Because it's fun.  Why do they like to tell you?  I don't know why.  I'm not an Illuminati.  So they put it in movies like a direct-to-video release of a Samuel L. Jackson movie? 
[01:00:30]  Unthinkable, man.  Wouldn't they want to put it in a movie that everyone's going to see, like Toy Story 3 or something?  Well.  It made like $109 million.  Right.  The dichotomy, Anthony, it's the dichotomy.  The Patriot.  Dichotomy.  All right.  What do you got on the Gulf?  What do you got on the Gulf?  Oh.  What do you?  Whoa.  What, sir?  Your turn.  And now you don't want to talk. 
[01:01:00]  What do you got on the Gulf oil spill, sir?  The Gulf oil spill was obviously premeditated.  Yeah, I said that, too.  Goldman Sachs sold 44% of their shares, and Hayward sold over 30% of his and paid his mortgage off.  Let me answer the question.  They always sell beforehand.  But let me ask the question.  To answer Opie's question, nothing.  He has nothing on the oil spill.  Somebody sold some stock and made some money and went, wow, what a stroke of luck.  There's a conspiracy for everything. 
[01:01:30]  So if he's in that world, I want to know what the conspiracy is on the Gulf oil spill.  Well, they knew it was leaking.  They knew they had a big, huge potential disaster on their hands.  There was oil seeping up from the seafloor, supposedly.  So they knew it could blow.  And then there was guys in Houston telling them to pump the well full of seawater.  The guys on the rig say, are you nuts?  It's going to blow up.  It blows up.  The guys quoted all over the media saying, are you effing happy?  Are you effing happy?  You blew the rig up.  So, you know, I mean, you tell me, guys.  Who knows? 
[01:02:00]  Wasn't this, um...  Why did we do that, then?  This came up, though, on a break in two electric boogaloo.  If you go to six minutes in, you'll see that somebody actually put a quart of oil in their  65 Chevy.  Sorry, sorry, Eric.  Refusing help from 13 countries when we could have had some help.  We always refuse help when it comes to stuff like that.  Oh, well, the guy makes a point.  Yeah, because of the Jones Act, Jimmy, they were protecting the unions.  Is that what it was?  I actually don't know why. 
[01:02:30]  I mean, I just think we typically do refuse help.  I'm not saying it's smart.  Because it's fucking Britain's problem.  Yeah.  Let them fucking fix it.  It's everyone's problem at this point.  It's all our problems.  Ah, that'll shut it away.  Larry King is doing a fucking telethon tonight, okay?  I'm doing a telethon.  What's the telethon for?  Just make BP pay for it.  Yeah, they got some cash.  I mean, don't.  I bought stock.  Some cash on hand.  All right, Eric, you done?  All right, so folks, unless you guys got any more questions, you need help figuring  stuff out.  Oh, yeah, we need help figuring it out. 
[01:03:00]  All right, seriously, I love the show list all the time.  Is there any hidden messages in Ghost Dad?  Yeah.  Besides that Bill Cosby sucks.  Leonard Part 6, I think.  Leonard Part 6, anything in there?  How's that?  Because Part 6, 6 is June.  Oh, shit, Anthony.  Oh, shit.  Not really sure on that one.  All right.  All right, guys, have a good one.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Someone wants in on this.  Paul in Tennessee, you're still on with Eric in Kansas City.  What do you got?  Hey there, Paul.  Hey, guys. 
[01:03:30]  July 4th is Independence Day, right?  Yeah.  I jacked off to Little Jimmy this morning at 7.04 a.m.  Ooh.  7.04.  That's right.  And he was wearing Depends undergarments.  So Independence.  Wow.  Oh, there you go.  It's too funny for Chip.  All right.  That was a Chip, Jim.  Let's go to Florida Kid in Florida, obviously.  Florida Kid.  No, he's not from Florida.  He actually looks like Esterole.  That should have been Chip.  That was a damn mediocre one. 
[01:04:00]  It was.  I liked it.  Florida Kid.  All right.  I want to tell this stupid guy that I was born 9 pounds 11 ounces at 9-11 o'clock in  room 9-11.  Did I orchestrate it?  You tell us.  What's your name?  Hamid Karzai?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  You tell us.  Oh, you fucking moron.  Dick Cheney.  We know he put the whole thing together.  All right, Eric.  I think we got to let you go.  Gatekeeper.  Hey, man.  You warned us, though.  So today's the day or tomorrow? 
[01:04:30]  I'll say today.  Why not?  If it's tomorrow, everybody will look like a big sucker.  What time?  What time are we looking at?  1.30.  All right.  That's good.  I should be home by then.  Well, I'm writing this fucking guy's number down just in case.  Wow.  Just in case.  Go ahead.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Kreskin.  Stop.  Oh, boy.  Great.  Why do Ron and Fez have to get the good disaster thing on their show?  What happened?  Well, it's going to happen at 1.30.  Oh, during their show. 
[01:05:00]  And it's going to be during their show.  We get to fucking, you know, we miss it.  Well, thank God.  We can go hug our loved ones first.  I hope it's dirty bomb.  I don't.  Don't hope for a dirty bomb.  You don't want a dirty bomb?  No, because I.  Like a dirty bomb.  You live on Long Island.  You'll be okay with a dirty bomb.  Oh, yeah.  Us, not so much.  Please.  Us, not so much.  BP.  God damn.  This guy likes his fucking yacht race as well.  What a cunt this guy is.  Well, he's destroying our country. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, come on.  He's got to have some fun.  But what does somebody in his life go?  Yeah, it's probably not going to look good if you go to the boat race.  He probably said, I don't give a fuck.  In the end, they don't give a shit.  I'm taking a bunch of this company money and paying for this cleanup shit.  He don't care.  He had this to say, though.  He is frustrated because he cares about the small people.  And we care about the small people.  You probably shouldn't call everyone that uses your product the small people. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, that's bad.  You're talking about midgets?  The small people.  BP chairman Carl Henrichs-Fanberg apologizes to the small people.  Holy shit, is this enraging.  What an out-of-touch company.  Oh, wow.  Really?  What fucking dummies.  They really don't get it.  He is frustrated because he cares about the small people.  And we care about the small people.  I hear comments sometimes that large oil companies are greedy companies or don't care. 
[01:06:30]  But that is not the case in BP.  We care about the small people.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to the American people  on behalf of all the employees in BP, many of whom are living on the Gulf Coast.  And I do thank you for the patience that you have in this difficult time. 
[01:07:00]  I think that's just a translation thing.  It's a gas.  But the guy shouldn't have been on a fucking yacht doing a great yacht race, whatever it was.  No, I want to apologize to these small, crappy little people as I am on my yacht.  He could not be here to apologize for himself as he is shitting on serpents and their mouths on face and making them eat it. 
[01:07:30]  Let's go to Rich in Jersey.  He's at the gas station literally pumping high test into a seal's mouth.  He said he's very sorry while he is putting gas all over small fish laughing and setting them on fire for a million-dollar bet.  A million-dollar bet.  I hate the small people.  They stink.  Rich in Jersey, what do you got?  Hey, guys. 
[01:08:00]  You know, I heard a thing last week.  They're always talking about how the oil will fill up this many football stadiums and things like this.  And they said something about it would fill half the Empire State Building.  And I thought, you know, if you took that out 100 miles into the ocean and dropped it a mile down and let it leak out for two months,  would that really destroy the whole Gulf Coast?  And how big the ocean is, that's a little oil.  Yeah, you know, I did some rough calculations, and it comes to about two or three parts per trillion in the Gulf. 
[01:08:30]  And that's the equivalent of putting a teaspoon of oil into 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools.  You did all that math, huh?  So, listen, you just look up the volume of the Gulf, the number of oil, you know, the gallons of cubic feet.  Sure, it's 800 pools and not 911 pools, if you know what I mean.  What?  Yeah.  Then why does it look so messy down there?  Oh, blow that off.  I don't know that it is messy. 
[01:09:00]  I see a little bit, you know, some pockets here and there.  I mean, some of that oil is going to wash up to shore, and it's going to collect together and coagulate and make tarballs and things.  But I think 99.9% of the Gulf isn't going to see a single drop of oil.  Yeah.  Well, is this your prediction?  It looks really messy down there.  Did you see the pelicans?  Yeah, did you see the pelican?  They don't, they don't, they look like they're all oily. 
[01:09:30]  Affected.  You get the impression, though, that if you started walking from Texas to, you know, Key Largo, you'd be sludging through six inches of oil sludge all the way along.  It can't be any more than five inches, right?  Anyway, it's just a, yeah, anything you can do to that.  Look up the volumes and calculate them out.  Let's calculate, yeah, put it in some kind of what we can understand.  How much oil would it be in a 10-gallon fish tank?  A drop. 
[01:10:00]  Not even a drop.  Would it be like a pinhead?  He's saying not even a drop.  Wouldn't even be a drop in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.  I mean, how many, divide a teaspoon by 800.  Wouldn't be a drop.  Well, it's got to leak out over two months' time.  So, Rich, what you're saying is all those people that lost their livelihood down in the Gulf, really, they have nothing to worry about, right?  No, I think some people did, but I heard an article or something on the news this morning saying that a lot of fishermen are thinking the restrictions are way too broad, 
[01:10:30]  that they're restricting a lot of areas that are perfectly safe to fish in.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure they'll give back some of that water to the fishermen.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They just got to make sure everyone's safe for us.  Can't wait for now.  Gulf shrimp.  Dude, I had fucking shrimp the other day.  I was looking at them like, hmm.  Oh, you're braver than me.  I won't touch shrimp.  You're done officially?  For a little while, yeah.  See, that's the problem, Rich.  People probably could eat the seafood still, but a lot of people are a little paranoid now.  Yeah, fuck it. 
[01:11:00]  I think, yeah, that's the problem.  I think there's a lot more perception than there is.  And the news media wants you to make it.  You make it think it's a really big story.  And there's $20 billion now already from BP and all kinds of other money.  I see somebody with a shrimp boat that hasn't been out of dry dock in six years looking for a $2 million settlement because of his business.  You've just got to devein him now with acetone is what you do.  It keeps him clean.  Oh, Rich.  Rich got the phone's list.  Look at that stupid duck right now.  Look at the laugh on that duck's face. 
[01:11:30]  That duck is laughing.  He is laughing.  Put oil on him.  Laughing or trying to breathe.  One or the other.  How did he get it all over his body?  Because he's stupid.  What did his duck friends have buckets of it?  Go get over here.  Throw oil on him.  Duck.  Maybe he was tarred and feathered for being a fornicator duck.  Well, obviously a lot of people want to talk to Rich.  We've got Fred in Maine. 
[01:12:00]  You're on with Rich in Jersey.  Yeah, I want to know how much oil it will take to devein or whatever.  Rich.  How much is it going to take to drown Rich?  Let's calculate how many pints of oil he can ingest.  You're called.  Dude, are you on a cell phone?  Hold on, Rich.  I'll do your own calculation.  Rich, hold on.  Dude, your phone broke up.  What was that devein line you had?  Oh, you guys are talking about deveining fish. 
[01:12:30]  I'm a clam digger from Maine.  You put a quart of oil in a cove and you can't dig there for months.  You put 1,000 ducks into a cove and they take a dump and you can't dig there for three years.  Now, these people down in Louisiana have worked around the water their entire lives.  Their kids and their grandfathers have worked around the water their entire lives.  Now they're out of a job.  So let's calculate how many million people are going to be out of a job because BP needs oil. 
[01:13:00]  We all need oil, yes, but we don't need to drill in 5,000 feet of water where we can't even fix anything.  All right, so you're agreeing with Rich that a lot of this is just people kind of jacking it up to get money?  Yeah, but I'm a clam digger from Maine.  Don't say that about yourself.  We don't allow offshore oil.  All right, all right, all right, all right, thank you, sir.  You're a damn what?  Actually, why don't we go right down to Louisiana? 
[01:13:30]  Shane, you're on with Rich and Jersey.  Great.  Hey, dude, I don't know where.  I understand you're getting your calculations on volume, like depth and stuff-wise,  but, yeah, it's covering the entire coast down here,  and there are people who completely lose their jobs and livelihood, and you're a moron.  Rich?  Well, I don't think I'm a moron, but I'm sure that some of the oil is going to wash your shore someplace,  but I'm just wondering if it's really as widespread as people say.  I don't feel like when the Exxon Valdez ran ashore, you saw these long coastlines, 
[01:14:00]  because these things were close to shore, and a lot of it washed right up on the shore.  You know, this stuff's hundreds of miles out, and it's dispersing a lot of places,  and some of it's going to wash up someplace.  Like, if you throw a message in a bottle, it can end up in Australia.  You know, it's going to go somewhere.  But I just don't see that the scope of the impact is going to be quite as big as people are predicting it's going to be.  It doesn't seem to be that kind of volume of oil.  The problem is with Louisiana is, okay, you've got Pensacola and all them, they have the beaches. 
[01:14:30]  It's bad what's going on with the beaches right now.  But you scoop the sand up, and that's the end of it.  With Louisiana and the marshlands and all that, you can't just go there and scrub every little grain of sand.  I mean, the grass out there.  Any place that the oil comes to shore is going to be a big problem.  There's no question about it.  I'm not debating that.  I'm just questioning whether we're going to see this, you know, thousands of miles of contaminated beaches.  You know, I've got to stop everyone for a second. 
[01:15:00]  As we have this discussion, they're showing a Florida beach where everyone is enjoying the hell out of the beach.  Like, nothing's going on.  And you've got three guys in green shirts.  I guess they're trying to pick up some tar balls.  The tar balls look like little rabbit pellets.  Yeah, they're nothing.  They're barely noticeable.  And they have hazmat suits on while everyone else is, you know, sunning themselves, enjoying a nice beach day.  That's how it is in Panama City right now.  You've got a few guys that aren't working for BP, but they're just volunteers. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  And they're just picking up tar balls.  It's like you pick up golf balls, basically.  Right.  But it doesn't look like it's really affecting anything in that area of Florida, obviously.  But I don't know what my point is.  CNN is showing this like, holy shit, look at what's happening down here in Florida.  The whole place is being destroyed.  No one was affected as these people were walking up and down the beach, picking up these tiny,  tiny little tar balls.  All right.  How will this affect Jimmy Norton at the Borgata, July 2nd and 3rd? 
[01:16:00]  You know, they say that that's actually going to cause a problem at the casino.  Really?  Because all the tar balls are going to wash up and be in the front row.  I said wash up.  Wash up and sit there.  That was a damn good one.  All right.  Shane, there's oil everywhere.  Rich is saying it's not as bad as people are saying.  It's not as widespread as everybody's saying, but it is contained.  Like the worst of it is contained basically to our wonderful stage. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  Yeah, you know, it's a lot of oil, but that's a big body of fucking water right there.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So what, do you think Rich is onto something?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm saying this isn't as bad as everyone's making it out to be.  Really?  It's bad.  It's bad.  But the, you know, the media, they love making fucking everything seem all, why would this  be any different?  But we've been watching the oil just pour out.  Yeah.  But what is that?  Over two months now. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, but when you're talking about entire fucking Gulf of Mexico, that's giant.  Is it giant?  That is giant.  Imagine flying over it.  Yeah.  Like, and then you get like, some fucking oil.  Cares.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  I think when you're talking how many, you know, gallons or something in the ocean, it's  like how many, you know, inches into space something went.  It's just the mere fact that you're talking gallons and barrels and something, you know,  the volume of the Gulf of Mexico, you can look it up, I found it to be 2.5 times 10 to 
[01:17:30]  the 15 cubic meters.  It's just, it's massive.  And when you talk about it, there hasn't even been a million cubic meters of oil into it  yet.  So you're saying that like, you know, if you look at it like parts per second, per second,  it's not as bad as you're saying.  Listen, I'm not saying, you know, 200, 5,000 are different because I'm not a physicist.  But, you know, anybody can look up the numbers and, you know, do your own calculations. 
[01:18:00]  If I'm off by a million times, maybe it's a cup of water and one Olympic class, I mean,  Paul.  All right.  So we have nothing to worry about in the end.  Yeah, we're fine.  Except for 1.30 today.  1.30 today.  When something happens.  Is that the, 1.30 today is the time?  That's what he said.  That's the other guy.  That's the other guy.  All right, Rich.  All right.  You pretty much got everyone fucking reacting to your little phone call.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome.  Thanks.  Punch it out. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Rich thinks it's no big deal.  So, yeah.  Anthony, we got to reset the wrestler death clock.  Oh, man.  We started this bit a while ago with Sam, who's a big wrestling fan.  Us, not so much these days.  We used to be in.  We used to be in.  I saw a commercial for wrestling and there was some guy babbling about something and  another guy was there and it was all like, whoa, about what the guy was saying.  I'm looking at, who the fuck are these people?  You don't even know.  I have no clue.  None clue. 
[01:19:00]  Well, Kane is furious right now because the Undertaker was found in a vegetative state  and everybody's trying to figure out who left him in that state.  Who died?  No, the Undertaker is in a vegetative state.  That's not the guy who died.  He was found and they're trying to figure out which wrestler is responsible.  You do realize the Undertaker will be just fine in the end, right?  What do you mean?  This shit happens all the time.  Then why would Kane be so angry?  He interrupted the main event at the pay-per-view last night.  Because someone put him in a vegetarian state.  Vegetative, not vegetarian. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, I thought he just wasn't eating steak anymore.  No.  And that was bizarre to Kane.  No.  What?  Eating salads.  No.  A vegetative?  Is it because he's 60 years old now and needs a little time off?  Yeah.  Relax a little bit?  No, he was obviously.  Yeah, how old is the Undertaker?  He is probably 48.  Get the fuck out of here.  I would put him older than that.  It's got to be older than that.  I would put him older than that, my friend.  So he's in a vegetative state and Kane is what? 
[01:20:00]  And why do we care?  Whoa, that's what's going on.  I mean, maybe that's what was going on in the commercial Anthony song.  You do realize in the end everyone's going to be okay, right?  Because that's how wrestling is.  Hopefully.  And where's Vince been?  Has he been part of the hijinks and shenanigans on wrestling?  He came out a couple weeks ago because Bret Hart was announced as the new general manager of Monday Night Raw.  But Bret Hart hates Vince McMahon.  Wow, Vince McMahon came out.  Vince McMahon basically killed his brother. 
[01:20:30]  Wow, that's an accident.  Why would you work for the guy that killed your brother?  He fired him at WrestleMania.  He beat him.  Why would you go back to the company that killed your brother?  To be the general manager of Raw.  That must be really awkward when they see each other.  Because they both know, like, well, you know, I'll start taking chances because the numbers were slipping a little bit.  Sorry.  Remember?  Oops.  Oopsie.  He was not the first wrestler to come down from the ceiling.  That's fine. 
[01:21:00]  But his brother died and he goes back to the company that killed his brother.  That's bizarre to me.  That is.  It was an accident.  Really?  Yeah.  Was it?  Unfortunate accident.  What was the date?  Some say.  It was May.  That's right.  It was May.  Go ahead.  May?  Do the math.  Might have been.  Do it.  23rd or something?  I don't know.  I don't know for sure.  I think it was right around my birthday.  I think you might be right.  If you look an hour and 20 seconds into Father of the Bride 2, you'll notice a shit fucking movie. 
[01:21:30]  I was right.  A little hint falls out of Steve Martin's wig.  Yeah, you know what?  Owen Hart ruined my birthday that year.  I'm sorry.  I mean, I guess I'm sorry.  Yeah, because fucking everyone's talking about Owen Hart.  I'm like, it's my day.  This is my day.  He left a kid and a wife behind.  Well, it sure didn't affect Bret Hart.  He went right back to the company that destroyed that family.  It's been 10 years and it was an accident in Bret Hart.  It's 10 years already? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, it was 1999.  Wow.  Wow.  So anyway, the wrestler death clock, a bit we started a while ago.  We told Sam, we're like, I don't think wrestling can go 90 days without a death.  Yeah, you said that.  We've now gone through two cycles in which it has not gone 90 days without a premature death.  Really?  Yeah, because we had the clock going and then Canyon died less than 90 days after whoever was before him.  And so then we reset the clock and then who died after that.  And that was 77 days later. 
[01:22:30]  On Friday, an indie wrestler named Trent Acid, who's been wrestling for about 10 years, died at the age of 29.  29.  What's his name?  Trent Acid.  Do you know who he is?  Yeah, I actually worked with him in a bunch of shows.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  So in the wrestling world, this is a big deal?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Anybody who follows indie wrestling, it was.  Because he was one of the guys who, for a while, everybody said he's going to be the next big star.  He's going to make the WWE.  He's going to do this.  And then he had his own demons and he was in jail for a while. 
[01:23:00]  Why wasn't he a big star?  Well, he couldn't get his stuff together.  What was he into, Sam?  What was his drug of choice?  Because he liked drugs, apparently, and there are reports that in April he was busted with heroin.  Oh, a little heroin.  He did some time in jail recently, and that kind of put a damper on the upswing his career was in.  Well, he sounded like he had a full life. 
[01:23:30]  How old was he?  29, actually.  Oh, I heard wrong.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was 92.  No, 29.  Oh, I switched it around.  29.  Oh, 30 in November.  That's different.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  So, I mean, he could have cleaned himself up and still made a run for it.  He was still wrestling.  You know, Rex in Massachusetts makes a good point, Sam.  Yeah.  Owen Hart wasn't the first to come down from the ceiling.  You're correct, sir.  Thank you.  But he was the fastest.  Well, that's really distasteful. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, shit.  Rex in Massachusetts.  Rex is pretty bad.  Yeah, I'm sure Bret Hart's fine with this joke, considering he works for a company that killed his brother.  I think Bret Hart realizes that accidents happen, and, you know, we move on from things.  How desperate was he that he had him go back to the company that killed his brother?  I don't think he was desperate.  There's a desperation there.  He wanted to do something back in the wrestling business.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, we've got to reset the wrestler death clock.  Yeah, we haven't made it in 90 days.  It's back to zero today.  Let's mark it. 
[01:24:30]  Well, technically, Friday, yeah.  So, we've gone, like, three days.  Well, that's good.  So, that's all right.  Grizzly Smith died before him, but that was Jake the Snake, Robert's father.  He was very old.  He made it a long life.  Was he a wrestler?  He was a wrestler.  Way back when.  Jake the Snake's not doing very well these days.  No, but he hasn't been doing very well for about 15 years.  That's true.  He's defying every law.  Yeah, he's one of those guys that, yeah, just hasn't been doing well for a long time.  It's just his life.  Yeah.  He was huge back in the day. 
[01:25:00]  He was.  Yeah.  Many people say that the wrestler was loosely based on Jake the Snake, Robert's.  Really?  Could have been loosely based on every wrestler.  Pick a fucking wrestler.  Not Trent Acid.  He didn't quite.  Trent Acid.  Well, no.  Trent Acid.  Yeah.  He was good.  All right.  Let's go to Dave in New York.  Dave.  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  Morning.  Good morning.  Well, this guy talking about the oil. 
[01:25:30]  I don't know where he's coming from.  He figured it all out.  Olympic-sized poles.  A cup of oil.  No big deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, no big deal.  It's like set off a couple of nuclear bombs.  There's just going to be a little bit of radiation in the atmosphere.  No big deal.  A couple of parts per million.  Do you think it's that bad?  Do you think this is as bad as a couple of nuclear bombs?  Are you agreeing with Rich?  Of course I am.  This is nothing.  This oil spill is nothing.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  I'm thinking the media is making much, much more of it than it really is. 
[01:26:00]  But we see the oil just pouring into the Gulf.  Oh, yeah.  There's oil pouring in.  There's people cleaning up.  It's not going to be a relief thing until August.  You know.  Que sera, sera.  There's not supposed to be any oil in the ocean.  There's not supposed to be any oil in the ocean.  Why not?  There's a bunch of shark and whale shit floating around.  There's all kinds of crap in there.  And there is oil underneath the fucking ocean floor.  And it breaks up and fucking diffuses through the fucking whole ocean and gets caught up 
[01:26:30]  in currents.  And before you know it, it's gone.  Where does it go?  Inconsequential little beads of oil somewhere off Africa.  It just spreads out.  Oh, God.  It looks bad localized.  If you look at a place that got really affected by it, yeah, it looks horrible.  Right.  Like dead birds and wetlands all fucking greasy and shit.  But, you know, the big picture, the whole Gulf. 
[01:27:00]  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, that's like just a little Chernobyl.  It's fine.  All right.  And it's fine with the oil spill, too.  But then why is Larry King doing his thing?  Ratings.  Trying to get some ratings.  Trying to get people to notice him.  The ratings are dropping for his show.  I read a poem about footprints in the sand.  Will the oil affect the footprints in Jesus carrying me during my hard times?  Comment.  Oily footprints in the sand. 
[01:27:30]  Oily footprints in the sand.  We could rework that little.  Is it a poem?  I noticed during the toughest parts of my life, there was only one set of oily footprints.  In the sand.  And another set from the sister of the girl that I'm married to that I was fucking.  Come, Prince in the Sand.  Question.  How will this affect my infidelity? 
[01:28:00]  Stupid Larry.  How the fuck do they do this Red Bull air race?  They're showing the footage on TV.  I'm amazed.  I don't get it.  They set those pylons up.  They're so low to the ground.  Wow.  Hundreds of miles an hour.  It's amazing.  It's a plane.  Yeah.  Is this a demonstration or is this a new sport?  Does anyone know?  Does anyone know?  So it's a sport and they go from, what, city to city?  Pylon racing, yep.  Wow.  That's just amazing.  They used to do this in some planes that were just sick and constantly crashing. 
[01:28:30]  It was always a crash.  So I was going to watch it.  Was there any crashes over the weekend?  No.  Nothing, huh?  No.  They use these blow-up pylons now because they used to hit the pylons and the wings would rip off.  Now it's like an inflatable pylon.  So that they have a chance to survive if they hit it?  Yeah.  What's the fun of that?  They're going to fill the fucking pylons with gas and put small children on top of them.  Have a little risk.  It really is amazing watching these fucking guys fly these planes.  How the fuck do they do this? 
[01:29:00]  They are amazing pilots.  It really is.  What's the space between the pylons that they're hitting?  When they go through.  Not much space.  Unless they go sideways.  Unless they go sideways like that.  That's a slalom.  Yeah.  And then when they go flat, it's pretty close wingtip to wingtip.  That's just amazing.  Yeah.  How fast are they going?  Fucking cool as shit.  Doing probably 30, 40 miles per hour.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  Oh!  Oh!  I'm dead!  Eric in Colorado. 
[01:29:30]  Eric!  Well over 200.  Yeah, hey, I got a question for Sam.  If the...  Sam said The Undertaker was in a vegetative state.  Yes, that's right.  But if The Undertaker dies, who buries all the other dead wrestlers?  Yeah, that's a very good point.  If the fucking Undertaker's...  Yeah.  He's in a vegetative state.  So who's going to...  But he's the dead man.  Yeah, who's going to bury the wrestlers that died much too young?  Well, Trent Asset was not a WWE superstar, so I wouldn't think...  Was he ever in the WWE?  No, he probably could have been if he had gotten his stuff together. 
[01:30:00]  Isn't The Undertaker a zombie?  He's the dead man.  He's not officially...  So how the fuck is he in a vegetative state?  Hopefully we'll...  That's a great question.  And hopefully we will get to the bottom of it.  Are you worried?  Yeah.  I mean, they haven't...  Yeah.  He hasn't been on TV.  What are you doing?  Kane attacked...  What surgery is he getting that they have to fucking...  Yeah, he's dead.  Well, last night at the pay-per-view, Kane attacked CM Punk.  So he thinks the Straight Edge Society might have something to do with this. 
[01:30:30]  CM Punk?  Yes.  Never heard of CM Punk.  He's the leader of the Straight Edge Society.  Straight Edge Society.  Society.  Yes.  Society.  Yes.  They're just the scapegoats.  And you take this all in.  Yeah.  The pay-per-view was good last night.  There was a pay-per...  See, I don't even know when the pay-per-views are.  It was good last night.  It wasn't.  They used to promote all those pay-per-views on our show.  New WWE champion, new world champion, new women's champion.  Who's the new WWE champion? 
[01:31:00]  Sheamus.  Stone Cold?  Sheamus.  Where was Stone Cold in that?  Stone Cold was not in the match.  He doesn't wrestle actively anymore.  Oh.  He's not an active wrestler.  Oh.  He stays home on his ranch now, these days.  Yeah.  Oh.  Twitter's ridiculous things.  Like what?  He's in...  Let me find it.  Do you follow him?  Yeah.  Do you follow all wrestlers?  Not everyone.  A lot of them are Twittering now.  A lot of them.  So we're going to read a Stone Cold Steve Austin tweet.  This should be good.  Do you really love wrestling as much as you used to? 
[01:31:30]  Are you getting a little sick of it and you kind of have to?  No, I love it just as much.  I watched the pay-per-view last night.  Wow.  Do you get excited?  Very excited.  How does...  When there's a good angle going on, she's very excited.  She's not excited about it.  No.  She's not...  How does she feel about it?  About your interest in it?  Not so much wrestling itself, but your fanatical interest in wrestling.  She's accepting of the interest in general, but I mean, once it's like...  It's on like four days a week. 
[01:32:00]  You watch four days a week?  I try to.  You do realize, like, you're...  An asshole?  She's completely above you as far as your league goes.  Physically, you mean?  In every way.  Okay.  In every way.  And you are acting like a little baby with your little baby show.  And do you realize she's like a young woman who probably wants a responsible guy at some 
[01:32:30]  point in her life and looks at you and goes, he's a child.  I don't think she...  He eats little chicken nuggets and french fries.  I don't call them that.  And watches wrestling.  It is rated TVPG now.  They have shifted more toward a younger demographic, but there are still plenty of adult fans.  Yeah, those are the pedophiles.  They're not pedophiles.  Yeah, those are the pedophiles.  Those are the pedophiles.  No.  We learned that from Jim Florentine.  So give us a Stone Cold tweet. 
[01:33:00]  Like, he'll randomly, he comes up, he says, I just have been asked to sing the national anthem  for game eight between the Celtics and the Lakers.  This could be my big break.  And then he says, bad news, folks.  There is no game eight of the NBA finals.  Hell, I'm already in Boston, ready to sing.  Guess I'll grab a bowl of clam chowder.  It's strange tweets.  Be more funny!  Out shopping today in Beverly Hills.  Can't find a Walmart anywhere. 
[01:33:30]  Thought there would be one on Rodeo Drive.  See?  He's a redneck in L.A.  Ah, he's just a redneck in L.A.  So, did he leave wrestling thinking he was going to be a big movie star?  He's in the new oncoming.  Expendables?  Expendables, yeah, with Sylvester Stallone.  There's only three people not in that.  Bob Backlund, me, and you.  It's an all-star cast.  Yes.  Wow, Sam.  Jason Statham is in it.  Ah, right with him. 
[01:34:00]  He was a nice guy when we interviewed him.  You don't like Jason Statham.  No, every movie is manic with crazy camera.  Oh, I can't go slower.  Gotta do it.  We got it.  Run, punch, run, punch, skip, jump, eat, fuck, quick, run.  Punch, fuck, jump, run.  Fall!  Land on my feet.  Run, drive, skip, jump, jump, shut up.  Are you saying you don't like adrenaline junkies?  Nothing already with adrenaline junkies.  He's an adrenaline junkie.  Have a fucking bagel already.  Fucking relax.  Drive quickly!  Get on a train!  Hop off the train onto a plane! 
[01:34:30]  Plane balloon!  Fall!  Repeat!  Not a fan.  It's not a fan of the...  Thanks.  All right.  The high-action, high-adrenaline movies.  Let's go to Sam in New Hampshire.  Sam?  Hey there.  What's going on, guys?  Hey, Sam.  Hey, I had a question.  If Ant thinks the oil spill is now no big deal, does that mean Obama was right previously  when Ant was criticizing him for his response?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Oh, Obama's never right.  Yeah, but you're admitting...  Pick a side, homeboy.  Pick a side.  Oh, shit.  He's got you in a quandary. 
[01:35:00]  I'll always err to the side of he is in air.  I think he's wrong.  All right, Sam.  Thanks.  Well, he has to be presidential.  He has to be in control of a situation.  I'm saying the media's blowing this out of proportion, and he's got to react to it.  And he's not being presidential about it.  I'm saying it's no big deal, but I'm just a stupid radio guy who's talking out his ass into a microphone.  You really don't think it's a big deal? 
[01:35:30]  I'm confused by you today.  Not as big as they're saying.  Really?  Not as big as the press.  The press is all over this.  Well, the press, they exaggerate everything.  They blow it up.  Why is this any different than everything else they report on?  Well, oil's just spilling into the Gulf of Mexico for the last two months.  Eh.  It wasn't for a week.  Eh.  I don't know.  I'm not there.  Eh, I'm not either.  I'm just talking to my ass.  Okay.  I don't know.  I'm just speculating. 
[01:36:00]  That guy's math seemed to work out pretty good.  Oh, you kind of liked his math.  I liked his math.  John Sterling, I guess there was a great Grand Slam home run call.  Oh, of course there was.  Of course, he's the Yankee guy.  Yes.  That makes it about himself.  Oh, yes.  Even though he has no skills.  Oh, the Grand Slam.  Has to make it about himself as these guys are doing very impressive things on the field.  Yeah.  Who hit the Grand Slam during the Subway Series?  It was Teixeira.  Teixeira?  Oh. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  And he called it this way.  There'll be a 1-1 to Teixeira.  Swung on and hit in the air.  Did he look?  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is good.  It's a Grand Slam.  Perfect.  There you go.  And the call right there.  Perfect.  That was good.  All right.  Let's move on.  There's no problem.  There's going to be something.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, Teixeira.  Mark Teixeira sends a text message to left field.  Oh, you're on the mark, Teixeira.  It's a Grand Slam.  And the Yankees take out 4-0 lead. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, he does that little laugh before he does it all every time.  Fucking just sucks.  And now he's getting wordy.  Did he send a text message, by the way?  No.  Did he go like, I just hit a grand slim.  Fuck, I hate this correcting.  You notice he's starting to do two now in each one.  Yeah, yeah.  He does two for Granderson, and now he does two for Teixeira.  Now it's two.  Yeah.  Texting and the fucking, oh, he's the worst. 
[01:37:30]  He is the worst.  It's embarrassing.  Yes.  I'm looking at this thing in the paper, and it's very short.  Chuck Schumer is fighting for karate instructors with a history of child molesting, should not  be allowed to work around kids.  Right.  Ouss.  And the other kid-related jobs, including carnivore worker, clown, lifeguard, and sports  coach, should be off-limits to pedophiles.  And I just wanted to know, who's going to fight that?  Right.  You're really, yeah, you're really going in with that one. 
[01:38:00]  Schumer's taking on the tough ones.  But who's going to actually say, like, you know, look, I know it's a rough position, but  pedophiles should be carnival workers.  I think carnival workers and clowns, and those are the people that are going to fight it.  Yeah, please, can I stay?  But nobody would fight that.  I'm unemployed.  Oh.  Going to a series of lies.  You want to debate Schumer on TV over this one, Uncle Paul?  I'll talk to Chuck Schumer any time.  They all lied.  They made those kids. 
[01:38:30]  They were stealing candy, and I was getting it back.  Oh, right.  And you had to check, because they hide it sometimes in their pants.  Yeah, they hide it in their buttocks.  Never heard of that one.  You get in there real deep.  I've stolen some candy as I was growing up as a child, never in my buttocks.  Yeah, they don't even know you're looking.  You give them a little sardine oil.  Here, drink this.  Have you ever found candy in their buttocks?  They always get rid of it first.  Oh, do they?  Sure. 
[01:39:00]  And they think they're tricking you, but you're on to them.  Yeah, get in there and quit and look.  Jesus.  It's straightening right out.  I watched that Dakota Fanning rape movie last night.  That one, Hound Dog.  Why would you watch that?  Why wouldn't I?  I got that on Blu-ray and DVD.  No, it wasn't really a good movie.  You just feel bad for the kid.  Father gets hit by lightning and turns into a retard. 
[01:39:30]  And the grandmother's just a piece of shit.  A religious fanatic kind of a thing.  And she blames herself for the bad things that happen because she wants to see Elvis.  She's in love with Elvis Presley.  And her stupid little friend says he's going to get her Elvis tickets and then get some other girl Elvis tickets.  And then the friend invites her into this shed and says that this guy that he knows has Elvis tickets.  But the guy wants to see her sing Hound Dog and do her little Elvis moves. 
[01:40:00]  And she starts doing it.  And then the friend goes, no, you've got to take your clothes off and do it.  What?  So she takes her clothes off.  How old is she in this movie?  Like 14 or something like that.  And she starts doing her little moves.  She's actually probably 12 or 13.  I'm not sure.  She looks like 11.  I have no idea.  It just keeps going.  It just keeps going down.  So she takes her clothes off and starts doing it.  And the guy gets all excited and jumps on her and fucks her.  How old was he in the movie?  He was like fucking, I guess, 18, 19, something like that. 
[01:40:30]  She's supposed to be 12, but she actually was older at the time I think the movie came out.  And, yeah, I was just watching it going, Jesus Christ, it's a pretty twisted fucking movie.  And, yeah, it was just kind of a, eh, story and everything.  I'm just laying there going, ah, come on, where's the rape part?  Get it over with already.  You just wanted to see the rape part?  Just the rape part.  I was watching it on my iPad, actually.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's kind of cool because... 
[01:41:00]  Tugging your iPod.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, pud.  You don't hear pud anymore.  Ah, pud is great.  Went away.  A pud.  You could kind of lay down and turn the iPad, like in bed and lay it on the pillow.  So I don't have to kind of look at the TV.  Because it wasn't on the TV.  I got it from Netflix.  So I could have put it on the TV.  But it was just on Netflix.  So I just hit it.  And then you just lay the fucking iPad on, like against the pillow. 
[01:41:30]  and you could lay down and watch TV like that  and just like, eh, I'm falling asleep.  I'm really fucking digging that goddamn iPad.  Well, I would dig mine, too.  I fucking ordered it in 1984  and it's a cock-sucking thing still.  Hey, fucking Apple faggots,  how about you make enough?  How about you make enough?  I bought an iPhone.  I got the new iPhone coming on reservation  and then I try to get one for my chick.  Not that I want to,  but just because she'll fucking snivel. 
[01:42:00]  And they're not taking any more pre-orders.  It's like, make enough.  Yeah.  That's their strategy, though.  They want you to want.  They want hoopla.  They want hoopla around it.  You know?  I got mine reserved, all ready to fucking go.  There you go.  And what's happening today?  They're releasing the fucking, um,  the actual program, the upgrade today.  4.0.  So why would you upgrade if you're going to get the new phone?  Why bother?  I'm going to play with it now.  Yeah.  Why bother?  For the people that can't wait. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, but it doesn't have the two cameras and shit.  You just gotta...  What?  So you can put shit in folders?  No, but it's got, like,  it's got multitasking and, you know, folders.  Hey, wait a few more days.  Yeah, but, you know, not everyone...  When's the phone come out?  The new one?  Wait a few days.  The new phone comes out Thursday?  Yeah.  I'd rather wait a few days  and just get the new phone.  I'm going to download it today.  Why not?  I'm going to download it and see if I like it  because the new one...  Bob Kelly's had it for a while.  He said it's actually good.  Ah, Bob Kelly and his fucking crack shit.  No, it's not crack. 
[01:43:00]  He's not allowed to have it right now.  He's a developer, so he has it as a developer.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Bob Kelly's stupid.  He develops nothing but resentment and hate.  Look at these idiots.  Get your cars off the road!  What?  Those two cars will absolutely move.  There's an accident on the Garden State Parkway.  Well, it's...  In the middle fucking lane,  someone rear-ended someone.  Yeah, it's a fender bender.  It's a fender bender.  There's no damage to either vehicle.  Move your fucking cars.  They constantly think,  these dummies,  especially foreigners, 
[01:43:30]  that if they move the car,  it's considered leaving the scene of an accident.  So they don't even want to fucking move the car.  Get it off the road, shitheads!  Look at the traffic  because of that dumb fender bender.  You dummies.  It's a dumb fender bender  and it's backed up for miles  because they're in the center lane.  Center lane, dead stop.  There's no damage evident on either vehicle.  Looks like both cars could just pull over.  Oh, is that annoying?  Get back in and drive off to the side.  People ought to get written up for that.  A cop ought to go,  you're both getting tickets. 
[01:44:00]  Why?  You didn't move your car.  I was not sure if I was allowed to move after the crash.  No, you were allowed.  Move!  They're afraid that people,  the cops won't be able to say what happened  if the cars have been moved.  And it doesn't matter what happened.  Like, the cops aren't going to take this in-depth report  with fucking the little wheel thing that measures  and, no, the insurance company goes,  all right, what happened?  You're both fucking assholes.  Your rates are both going up.  Here's some money.  Get off the road next time, shithead. 
[01:44:30]  If they see one car front-ended  and one car rear,  they got it.  Yeah, I think they pretty much can figure it out.  This is why people are getting the upgrade, Anthony.  You've lost touch with the common man.  I have.  You certainly have.  Mike in New York.  What's up, Mike?  Mike!  Hey.  Hey, the reason that we're getting the iPhone update, Anthony,  is because we're all not fucking millionaires.  We can't afford a new iPhone.  I was talking to Travis,  who is going to get the new iPhone. 
[01:45:00]  I was asking him why he's upgrading.  But the average person can't do that.  But I'm the average person,  and I just sell my phone on eBay  to cover the cost of the new phone.  See, Travis is smart.  Who buys a phone on eBay?  That's a lot of people,  because they'll unlock them  and then sell them to anybody.  An unlocked iPhone is strong.  People love that shit.  I sell mine for $350, $400,  and they can flip it for like $6 or $7.  How about this?  Get this.  My iPhone has a problem.  When it's set to vibrate,  it just constantly vibrates 
[01:45:30]  for no reason in my pocket.  And if you squeeze  the upper left-hand corner of it,  it vibrates.  So it's busted.  So I bring it in  to the Apple store.  I get a brand new one,  which I then buy the new new one,  and I take the new old one  and put it on eBay.  How about that?  You're not eBaying.  How about that?  You're on eBay.  What if they find your personal information? 
[01:46:00]  Do they can probably...  No, they can't,  because you wipe out the phone,  you restore it to the factory settings.  That could be fucking broken.  Come on, someone who really knows  how to hack could get that.  Anything could be.  Well, sure, but I've done it already,  and, you know...  You can get your fucking bank  or whatever information you got.  Travis lives a boring lifestyle.  There's nothing on his phone.  Yeah, this is the most exciting thing  I'm going to have for you.  Yeah, there's nothing on his phone.  Yeah, you wipe that thing clean.  We've got to take a break.  Louis C.K. is in the hay-os.  Oh, Louis's here.  Yeah, Louis joins the program next.  His new show starts on FX, 
[01:46:30]  I think this week, right?  Like...  They're running promos for it like crazy.  Well, where's my one-sheet on Louis C.K.  so I can start the plug-in?  I better have a one-sheet for Louis C.K.  Why would I?  Steve, really?  How is there not a one-sheet?  Really?  You got Louis C.K. coming in,  and it's nice to go,  well, his new show starts blank.  I don't know.  Hmm.  Here comes Steve now.  Where's the one-sheet?  Sort of running.  Yeah, with the one-sheet.  Oh, please drop dead right now.  Oh, wow.  That's harsh.  It's a long hallway. 
[01:47:00]  We still have a chance.  Damn it.  Hi, Steve.  Hey, sorry.  Why no one-sheet on Louis C.K.?  Sorry.  He's in the building?  Waiting on security.  Premieres Tuesday.  See, this is why I needed this.  Next Tuesday, June 29th, 11 p.m. on FX.  Why is he waiting for security?  Huh?  It's a half-hour line of security.  For what?  What are you talking about?  Was he in the system?  Yeah.  So why is there a half-hour wait?  For the Martha Stewart fucking thing?  Is that what it is?  I'm going to walk down  and see if I can get him around it.  You see, he just texted me. 
[01:47:30]  He said it's a murderous long line of security.  What the fuck is this?  An airport?  The building stays in one place.  We don't fly around.  Come on.  Holy shit.  So I'm going to go down there  and see if I can get him around.  Why is it a half-hour wait down there?  Apparently there's a lot of people.  What are they looking for?  I have no clue.  It's a dumb building.  I've never heard of it being that bad.  If this building blew up,  most people wouldn't give a shit.  Who would give a shit in the end? 
[01:48:00]  Jesus.  What?  What are you laughing at?  I just don't know how Steve thinks  he's got more pull than the security guards.  I'll get you in, Louie.  Don't worry.  It's a building that turns into a robot.  You don't ask.  You don't get it, Travis.  It's a bug.  I don't know that one.  Big.  Thank you.  This is stupid that there's x-ray machines downstairs.  I feel safer.  It's so stupid.  What the fuck?  It's a building.  It's a fake security.  It's a building. 
[01:48:30]  It's just a fucking facade, man.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  Hopefully Louie will be on the radio when we get back.  Maybe the security guys knew about the 9-11.  The chair.  The Patriot?  The chair from the Patriot.  And then the date in the Samuel L. Jackson direct-to-video movie.  Unthinkable.  Unthinkable.  Why extra security today in the building, eh?  Maybe that's it.  Just saying.  Just saying.  Just saying.  I hear you.  We usually don't have extra security. 
[01:49:00]  Does Samuel L. Jackson say motherfucker in that movie at any time?  I believe he does.  All right.  They were afraid.  I can't wait to see that.  Downstairs, apparently, it was this whole big stupid thing today because I'm hosting red-eye and they think that there's going to be, like, riots.  I know.  Well, not just for the fact that you're hosting it, but because I am also going to be a guest on red-eye tonight as you host it.  I tried specifically to have that blocked. 
[01:49:30]  It wasn't going to happen.  I made sure.  I said, I don't care who's hosting and I don't care what he thinks about me.  I'm on that show tonight.  It's going to be an ugly war tonight.  Yes.  Red-eye.  And the lovely and talented Ann Coulter.  Very good.  And Juliet Huddy.  Yes.  I don't know how I'm going to do as a host.  I'm a little worried.  No, you're going to do so good.  I know it.  You'll be fine.  I think you'll do very good.  I'm blinking a lot.  You think you're going to blink a lot?  I know I will. 
[01:50:00]  Leaving the monitor.  Welcome to red-eye where we...  I'm not going to...  I've watched, like, Greg and then who was the guy that was co-hosting?  Mikey.  Mike.  Mike Baker.  Yeah, when he was hosting.  Really doing a good job reading the teleprompter and, you know.  They're making it sound like they're just talking.  You have much experience with the teleprompter, Jimmy?  Let me see if you can tell the difference. 
[01:50:30]  Like, right now, I am talking in a normal voice.  And now I am reading Meredith Whitney on TV advises group CEO.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  There better be no breaking news.  Set your DVRs, people.  This could be amazing.  I'm really worried.  All right.  Fox News.  3 a.m.  Set the DVR.  East Coast.  East Coast, yes.  There you go.  Louis C.K. next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus. 
[01:51:00]  Sirius XM.  Oh, we're very happy.  Louis C.K. in studio.  He's got his new show, Louis, on FX, starting a week from tomorrow at 11 o'clock right after  Rescue Me.  And you didn't even know, but they sent the first four episodes to us.  Yeah.  And I checked it out.  And I brought it down to Philly, and everyone that was watching it with me fucking loving  the new show from Louis C.K.  Thank you.  Solid review coming in for you.  Awesome.  I haven't seen it.  And I get home, and I was away for a few days, and I just got a fucking envelope from here, 
[01:51:30]  which I didn't open.  And then Steve had made me a copy.  Well, seriously?  Yeah.  Jesus, man.  Jesus, man.  Fucking hell.  It's the pilot in the first three episodes.  Are you rerunning the pilot?  Well, I don't think the pilot ran anywhere yet.  No, they'll show the pilot.  The first night, it's the pilot, and then the second episode, the divorce episode, that  one, that's number four on your thing.  But there's two episodes that run the first night.  Okay. 
[01:52:00]  And I saw Jimmy in it.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jimmy was fantastic.  A lot of the people that do our radio show in it, Nick DiPaolo, Bob Kelly.  Yes, Bob Kelly was my brother.  He's your brother in that?  Yeah.  Was I supposed to know that?  Yeah, it's concerning to me that you didn't pick it up.  But it doesn't really matter.  It doesn't really matter.  Holy shit.  He's my brother in three episodes, and I don't know if he'll, you know, who knows.  He was only supposed to be in one, but he was good, so I brought him back.  Maybe I went and took a leak or something.  It was a great scene.  I didn't realize he was your brother. 
[01:52:30]  Please humiliate him somehow.  Oh, no, that's why he's...  He comes out next year, and he has AIDS, and he just can't stop blowing fucking people.  I'm like, you know, dude, I don't know about this.  He gets pretty humiliated on this.  Good, good, good.  And it's filmed.  I know you really appreciate how things are filmed, because I've seen you with your cameras  over the years.  Yes.  It's very obvious.  You're very serious about how it looks.  It looks very gritty.  Yeah, I know.  We shot with a camera that's called a Red, and it's like a film camera.  It's like a movie camera. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, that thing's cool.  It's like a big box, the red fucking...  Big red.  Yeah.  Well, it's black, but it's a monster.  And you use...  It takes real 35-millimeter lenses.  That's why you use them, like real-looking movie lenses.  Yeah, it has a little bit of a gritty look to it.  No makeup, I was telling Louie.  Not many actors or actresses.  A lot of just normal, funny guys, for the most part.  Yeah, and I do use actors, but there's no cast in the show.  Like, there's no set cast.  And Bobby ended up sort of playing his way onto the team, because he was in one scene 
[01:53:30]  and he did well.  So I put him in two more.  But nobody's in more than two episodes or so.  Because when you have a cast on a show, it's like you're making all these bets that these  six people will stay compelling for 13 episodes or whatever.  And then a lot of them, you end up going, oh, fuck, what are we going to have this guy  say?  He stinks.  That's quite a unique idea to just kind of blow off the cast thing.  That seems to be a staple of TV shows.  Yes, is to having a cast.  But it's usually what sucks about them. 
[01:54:00]  And also, you can tell there's a strain to make these two people talk and they're not  natural talkers.  Just to get them in a scene.  Just to have them be in it and just, okay, we have to develop this relationship.  Why?  If they're not in it.  So I started with nothing and people come in and they just kind of come and go.  But Dan said it was strange.  And that's why I like Louie's projects, because he goes against the norm.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not the polished fucking TV set and all the polished actors and actresses.  Well, nobody likes that anymore anyway.  Nobody likes watching that.  Right.  I mean, they're making reams of that shit. 
[01:54:30]  Like, beautifully perfected television.  With laugh tracks.  And no one gives a fuck about it.  All right.  You know, there's just, you know.  You want to explain, Louie, in your own words?  Because, I mean, I loved it, but, you know, just get the main.  Oh, what it's like, what it is.  Yeah, the main explanation of the series out there.  It's kind of hard to describe, because it's not, it doesn't, a lot of, other shows don't  have this format.  It's like, it's, a lot of times you see me on stage talking and then there'll be a story  that's a film.  Like, I kind of think of them as short films. 
[01:55:00]  Sure.  But they're all about my life.  They're all really, it's like, one way I describe it to somebody is it's autobiographical fiction.  Like, it's me playing myself, but none of this shit really happened to me.  Although we shot something that was based on a conversation.  It was like, it was really amazing.  Louie took this conversation that had happened and written this really fucking funny, well-written  scene.  The poker scene, right?  Yeah.  That was a great scene.  It was just so well done.  I was like, God damn, that's what you do with normal life.  Yeah, they were playing.  How you make it into something sellable. 
[01:55:30]  Playing poker.  Well, yeah, I guess I don't want to give away the scene.  No.  But a lot of funny guys just going back and forth, man.  A lot of funny guys.  Just very natural conversation.  That's why I asked Jimmy today, I'm like, was that all improv?  Because it had an improv feel to it.  But that whole scene was written.  Yeah.  There's a few bits that were improvised, though.  Like, there was a basic thing of this conversation going on about a subject.  And then everyone riffed, and I used a little bit of something.  I thought Rick was very good.  Rick Crome was really excellent.  He's the comedy star all the time with the glasses. 
[01:56:00]  And he just really was good, man.  Yeah, comedians have a certain thing that they do.  Comedians work well under pressure.  Like, that's what makes them.  They're not good actors.  They don't have good acting skill.  Jimmy's, like, one of the worst actors I've ever seen.  But I am awful.  It's horrible.  Oh, my God.  That's my one-seen appearance.  When we were doing that scene, I remember he tried to remember something,  so he'd look up, like, hmm.  Like, it was so ham-fisted. 
[01:56:30]  The hmm.  Yeah, exactly.  No, he's great.  Did he fold his arms?  I even waved my finger.  Scratch his chin.  Yeah.  No, Jimmy's a good example of guys who, it's not like they have this, like, well-bred acting skill,  but if you put them under pressure, they'll give you a good performance.  Sure.  Like, actors, you have to really make them feel good.  You have to say, actually, when you criticize them, it has to sound like a compliment.  You have to go, like, that was so great. 
[01:57:00]  And I'd love to have a variation of that, and by the time you're telling them how the variation is,  it's the opposite of what the shit is.  What they did.  The crap they did.  Because if you tell them, like, I can't really use that, they just fucking fall under pressure.  But guys like Jim, and Rick Crome was just an old comedian guy.  I told him during that thing he was fucking up and not getting some stuff right.  In front of everybody else, I said, I really need you to do better than that.  I'm not getting the information out of you. 
[01:57:30]  You've got to step it up.  This all comes from you.  And I saw him go, oh, fuck, okay.  And he nailed it.  He did nail it.  Yeah.  So that's what these guys are like.  And it's fun for me, because it's Caroline's, it's the Comedy Cellar, it's that whole environment that you guys live and breathe in, you know?  Yeah.  And your stand-up, how it's filmed, I told you last time, it's uncomfortable to watch, and I know you were going for that.  I know you were going for that.  I have no doubt in my mind.  Well, a lot of comedians that have watched it with me have said, oh, this is terrible. 
[01:58:00]  It looks like you're bombing, and the camera's too close to you.  And I realize that's because they are comedians, and they want you to shoot the stand-up in a very vain way with a beautiful floating camera, like it's a special.  Right.  But it's not a special.  The stand-up is part of the story.  The fact that I am a comedian, and I talk about stuff on stage that happens to me is part of the story.  The camera's a bit too close, and the angle's slightly uncomfortable.  Yeah.  And I go, I know Louis did that on purpose.  I had no doubt in my mind. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, it's awful.  So I had no problem bringing it to your attention.  But, yeah, we all loved it, Lou.  And it starts a week from Tuesday on FX.  No, and I learned, I mean, Jim's one of the guys I learned it from on Lucky Louie that if you have comedians, they're just sort of a murderer's row.  It's like the meat of your lineup.  Right.  Those are the guys that you can count on.  Nick DiPaolo is great.  To come across.  Nick is great.  Nick's a very good actor.  He's in one of the episodes.  I don't know if I saw him.  It's the one where we got in a fight in the episode.  Over Obama.  And people thought that it was real and it was on YouTube for a minute. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, that was, oh, okay.  We talked about that with you.  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah.  That's right.  They kind of blew the fucking bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because some asshole had to fucking put the.  Yeah, there was an extra with an iPhone and he recorded it.  Okay, right, right.  And he posted it online like it was real.  Prick.  Right.  But Nick was great.  Yeah.  We went after him, though.  We heard, we fucked up his life, I think.  Good.  Good.  How many episodes?  Thirteen.  Thirteen?  Second season?  You'll never work in this town again.  Who knows? 
[01:59:30]  I won't know until it's on the air.  Okay.  And Ricky Gervais.  I'm not going to cancel it yet.  It's not on the air yet.  Jesus.  Yeah.  We'll see.  Ricky Gervais is in one episode.  A couple episodes.  Yeah, he's on another one.  I saw one.  He's a doctor and holy shit, you and him going back and forth.  Fucking A.  Some of the funniest stuff I've seen on TV in a long time.  Yeah.  Ricky Gervais fucking kills for movie.  He's really good.  He's really good.  Yeah.  Damn.  That's the show.  You should have watched the episodes.  You would love them.  I know.  I got them sitting right at my house. 
[02:00:00]  They're all, again, Steve's copies.  It's wonderful.  Steve whipped off a few copies.  Yeah, he whipped off some copies.  Yeah, he's got to stop doing that.  That's not okay.  No.  I mean, there's still three.  You know, a good month before these are done airing.  Yeah.  How about Steve comes down here?  Because I think he's giving them out to pretty much everybody else.  Well, he's giving them.  No.  I was going, because when I heard that you had the first four, I was like, huh.  They sent them to those guys at Satellite?  Those fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Not you guys, but yeah. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, you know.  Just a regular guy down the hall.  Did they only send one copy like this?  I'll destroy after I view it.  I will not upload them.  I didn't know what it was.  It's safe in your house.  Bit torrents.  In your house.  In your house.  I don't know where my copy is right now, Lou.  So that is a God's honest truth.  All right.  Come on.  I think I might have left it in Philly.  I didn't know what it was.  Steve, what are you doing?  Louie's not happy with you.  How many FBI laws did you break?  How many of these fucking things did you run off?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What?  Sorry.  Just enough for these three, because we only got one copy of the previews, or the first 
[02:01:00]  episode.  So I put it up on you, Torrent, so that they could download it.  But I told everyone, please leave it alone.  Are you implying that I would do something illegal?  Because that's not true.  Of course.  You made one for Opie and one for Jim and one for Ant.  Yeah, because I asked Michael.  The original's right there.  You asked Michael O'Brien?  For two more, because we needed enough for the three of you guys to watch. 
[02:01:30]  He said, I only had one, and that's the one I gave you.  Okay.  What do I do?  Do you have a copy?  No.  You're a liar.  No, I don't.  Why would you lie?  I don't.  Why are you lying?  You have the first four episodes of Louie's new show, and you didn't double copy off for  yourself?  Not yet.  I'm not saying you would take that copy and then make a hundred copies.  No, I don't.  I haven't seen it yet.  I made them for you guys, and then I think I made one for Sam, too.  I have a copy.  This is coming with me.  Sam's got a copy, too.  Yeah, you better just take that.  Louie's a little paranoid.  Jesus.  Why wouldn't you just give that to somebody and then make two copies instead of three? 
[02:02:00]  And why does Sam have a copy?  Because Sam was supposed to do the one sheet, but he didn't do it.  This is how this happens.  Yeah.  It only starts with a couple copies.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Look, I had a few copies for the people in Philly.  By the way, that's why I don't believe in any conspiracy theory, because you can't give  four people copies without it ending up going somewhere.  Right.  It's like no one could keep secrets.  My one copy is at least ten now.  It multiplies.  Yes. 
[02:02:30]  That's how it works.  You shouldn't do that.  Best not be.  All right.  Louie's not happy with you, and you are lying.  You got a copy for this.  I don't.  I really don't.  How hard is it to just say, no, I don't?  I know.  I would have watched it had I had one.  Just keep saying it.  All right.  Oh, and here's the other.  There's mine.  Okay.  Louie.  Don't you love seeing it like this?  There it is.  Louie's not happy, man.  This was Sharpie.  Just Sharpie.  It's just four episodes. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, that's awesome.  It's just written in Sharpie like a fucking bootleg piece of shit.  You know how easy that is to take to Chinatown right now?  Of course.  Dropping on a Canal Street blanket.  There it is.  There it is.  Wonderful.  Blame him.  I thought of doing that when I was doing Pootie Tang, and they fired me off the movie.  I thought seriously about taking a beta tape to Canal Street.  It was white.  I'm just dropping it.  Why did you fire it from?  You were directing it, right?  Yeah, I wrote it and directed it.  And they fired you during the movie? 
[02:03:30]  No, it was during the editing.  I got to shoot the whole movie.  Wow.  During editing?  Yeah, well, that's when all the fighting happens.  The editing is when things get bad.  Yeah, yeah.  That's when nobody likes the movie, and they fight over how to fix it.  You have your idea of what you want.  Did you just shoot eggs out of your nose?  Yeah, it's all over my hands.  Who fired you?  The studio?  I didn't officially get fired.  They do it in a really fucked up way.  They flew me out to L.A., because they moved the editing to L.A., and they flew me out there. 
[02:04:00]  And then I show up to give notes, and they go, what are you doing here?  I go to the studio where they're editing.  They go, what are you doing here?  I'm here to edit.  And they're like, no, go to your hotel.  They put me up in a really nice hotel and flew me out first class.  They said, just go to your hotel, and we'll send you the reels as we cut them.  And I'm like, well, then I give you notes over the phone.  No, because we have to lock the reels now.  So I'm like, you just mean I'm going to be the first one to watch the movie in pieces.  You're out of, yeah, the whole loop as far as editing.  And I was like, you can't. 
[02:04:30]  And he goes, fuck you.  We flew you out here.  We gave you a first class ticket.  It was a really weird, creepy way to go about it.  Were they editing stuff, and you were just like, why the fuck did you cut it like that?  Oh, I hate it.  I mean, it's a bad movie.  It's a bad movie.  I made a bad movie.  I honestly don't know.  The thing is, having somebody edit your shit like that after you film it and have a vision of what you wanted  and then just have pieces cut out of it.  Well, and also they added dumb narration. 
[02:05:00]  Like, the movie was meant to be kind of awkward and strange.  That's the way that I make stuff.  And so they took everything that was sort of strange, and they explained it with narration.  Oh, that's what was good.  Yeah, yeah, that's great.  That's good.  How did Chris feel?  Did Chris kind of think that you had made a mistake, or was he like that?  Yeah, well, he was just trying to get the movie out, so he stayed with it and kept them involved in it and stuff.  But that was the end of my...  That's the way it goes.  You sign a thing that says you sign it there.  You work at their pleasure, you know?  Right. 
[02:05:30]  You can't complain.  I mean, nobody can be surprised.  You work for a movie studio.  It's not your own house.  They didn't come to your house.  You know, and that leads me into this.  So you got the new series, Louie.  Yeah.  I knew you were way involved, obviously, but creator, executive producer, writer, director,  editor.  Yeah.  It's all you.  It's all on you.  Yeah, I do all of it.  Yeah.  Is that just fucking nerve-wracking?  It is a lot of work, but I love it.  I didn't like having a writing staff when I had a writing staff, and you got to explain 
[02:06:00]  to 10 people why you want to do something.  It turns into more work.  It turns into having...  You have to have consensus from 10 people to put something on television.  What's funny that 10 people all agree is funny?  You know what I mean?  How do you get a network to agree to, hi, I'll be doing everything?  Like, that really isn't the norm there, and networks don't like going too far out of the 
[02:06:30]  box.  No.  Well, so how do you...  Do they even know what you're doing?  Jedi mind shit.  They don't have an idea what you're doing, even?  No, they don't know what the shows are about or anything.  What are they doing?  Until they see it.  That's hysterical.  They don't know until they do it.  A lot of confidence in you.  Well, I went there with a lot of leverage.  I don't usually go to Hollywood with leverage.  I usually go there when I really need money. 
[02:07:00]  Fucking nude pictures?  Yeah.  What did you have?  Jesus.  Well, I went there, and I had other networks offering me a lot of money to do a pilot.  And I think NBC and Fox were both bidding on shit, and I had just done a bunch of stuff  that really worked.  So then I got this call to go to FX, and this guy, John Landgraf, that runs it, the president,  he said, you know, if you do a show here, we can't really pay you a lot, but you can have  a lot of fun.  And I kind of heard that before, you know. 
[02:07:30]  But he was offering me $200,000 as the budget for the whole pilot.  And I was like, okay, so what do I get paid?  And he's like, no, that's...  That's the whole thing.  That's the whole thing.  Wow.  $200,000 is very low to do a whole episode.  What would a network give you for a pilot?  Well, the networks were offering me, like, I think I was being offered like $250,000 just  to write, just as a fee to write to the pilot.  If we had made the pilot, it would have been like about a million bucks.  It's about a million dollars to do a pilot. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  And I would have been paid $250,000, plus as an actor, I would have been paid more.  I would have made a lot of money, and that's what I was after.  Yeah.  And this guy's telling me, you have to run the whole show on $200,000.  That's weird, because that is kind of like here.  They tell us, you know, you're not going to make a lot of money, and you're going to have  a real shitty time every day.  And you won't have any control over what you do.  So it's exactly like that.  You won't make a lot of money, but you'll feel like you make even less.  Exactly.  Fucking place. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  So he said, only $200,000.  And I said, well, I guess I could do a sketch show for that.  And he said, no, I want it to be like your show about your life, like what I was pitching  to the networks.  And I just said, no.  I said, why would I?  That's dumb.  Why would I do that?  And then he called me at my house, this guy, and he said, you redheaded content.  And he said, I get it. 
[02:09:00]  You're working.  You want to go to NBC.  I totally get it.  You want to be the next Charlie Sheen.  That's what he said.  That's where you're headed for.  That's an insult.  You're going to be the next Charlie Sheen.  But he's exactly right.  That's what I was trying to like, signing a development deal to do a sitcom at NBC.  Right.  I would have had a shit show if I, and I wouldn't have made it on the air in not a million years.  No, of course not.  But he said, I said, look, the only way I'm interested in doing this is if you give me  the $200,000, like wire it to me in New York and I'll give you a show.  But I'm not pitching it. 
[02:09:30]  I'm not going through like a whole pitching with you and writing a script and sending it  to you.  I don't want to do all that.  Well, so you really did have them kind of like, hey, send me money.  That's all I have.  I'm going to make a show.  You're going to fucking put it on.  I said, well, it's only $200,000.  It was such a low bet for him.  Yeah.  And he was like, yeah, I can.  That's a check I can write today.  I don't care.  I mean, how, what are the, it might have stunk, but then he would just go, all right, he didn't  work.  So what?  It was a low, low ball bet for him.  And if it works out, you can probably grab him. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  So he did.  He sent me $200,000, literally wired it to me before I had a show idea.  Wow.  And I just thought, okay, I've got money and I know people who do TV and movies here.  So I just started hiring people.  Jesus.  That sounds exhausting.  I did it all backwards.  I went like, well, I'd like to shoot in a, I'd like to use that pizza place.  What do we, what happens there?  Like I, you know.  What happens there?  Yeah.  You know, and I started writing it in pieces and I did it and they loved it. 
[02:10:30]  So he said, let's do 12 more.  And I said, well, I want to do it the same way.  And he said, well, let's you and me sit down and talk about it.  And so what it came down to is I had a beer with him and I told him like three or four  story ideas.  And he said, yeah, all right.  And they gave me 300,000 per episode for the rest.  It's not a lot of money, but it's money that he was able to give me without asking any of  his bosses.  Yeah.  Without people having to account for things.  Yeah.  Cause if you, if he asked for more, then we'd have to go to the advertisers and explain to 
[02:11:00]  them why this show would be a hit.  It would be on the radar.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but this is, this show gets paid for by like fucking gold coin commercials and stuff  like that.  Like people that don't even know what they're advertising on.  They just buy time.  You need to buy gold right now.  Gold is up.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's good.  That's paying for this show.  So they don't lose, they can't lose money on my show.  Yeah.  It's so cheap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the jumping off point is if, if it becomes a big success, then I'll end up making more 
[02:11:30]  money than I would have.  I should jump in.  It doesn't look cheap.  It's a good gamble.  It doesn't.  No, it doesn't.  I'm amazed how little it, it costs to make.  Well, that's, it looks great.  That's what, cause I've been making like independent films and stuff in New York for years and I  know how to make money mean something.  There's so much waste in television and actually a huge, I really think about 80% of what it  costs to do a TV show is putting it through the network system and giving them their approvals.  That's, I mean, you remember Jim, we used to do a network, a table read and a network run 
[02:12:00]  through and a studio run through.  Notes, yeah.  Notes.  Wow.  Notes.  And those, those run throughs are expensive, like where you have to stage the entire show  and the only reason you're doing it is to show it to them so they can give you notes  and make you stay late and rewrite it.  And that was HBO, which was a great network, but they still, they made us do all this fucking  shit and it cost a fortune and it cost all the time we had.  But on this show I write something on the toilet and I call Blair, my executive producer, line 
[02:12:30]  producer, and I say, uh, get me an airport.  Let's shoot it.  And then we go shoot it.  Fuck.  That's it.  And then we cast it and it's gotta be, it's gotta be a good feeling.  No, it isn't.  It's a lot of pressure.  It's smart of them because I'm so scared for the show to stink for them to watch it and  go, this was a huge mistake.  Right.  And so I obsess about it.  I work much harder than I did on other shows and they, they, when they, I'm so excited  for them to get a show cause they don't even know what it's about. 
[02:13:00]  And if I get a guest star in it, like when I got Ricky, I didn't, they didn't know I got  Ricky.  They were just watching.  They're like, fuck Ricky Gervais.  It's like, how did he, how did he get him?  Somebody was jerking off in an office when they heard that.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  How much did you give him?  You got Ricky Gervais.  No idea.  You got your face and we gave him $200,000, this fucking guy.  Yeah.  So he, fuck, he, he kills it.  So that's the trick.  Right on.  If the show starts to stink, they'll come calling and start telling me what to do.  But for now, they don't care.  Can we put in a little blonde kid named Oliver? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  With the death knell.  So Louie, cause I guess I'm obsessed by you.  What's going on with you and Twitter, man?  Oh yeah.  I guess I get drunk in Twitter.  Is it real that you're getting drunk?  It's happened twice.  That I've been on airplanes and drank.  This last time I didn't eat.  Like I, I worked all day and I didn't eat.  Like I worked too much.  I forgot to eat, you know?  Right.  And then I get on a plane and I get a rum and Coke and we had to sit on the tarmac for 
[02:14:00]  a while.  So they started giving us more drinks.  Yeah.  And I got fucking bombed really fast.  There's something about rum.  Yeah.  And I Twittered.  I was doing a show at the improv.  So I Twittered to say, hey, I'm doing a show at the improv and fuck you motherfuckers.  Like that's just the way I said it.  And I started going, eh, fuck this.  And I started saying this shit.  About Sarah Palin.  Yeah.  It came out and it wasn't like, I'm going to shit on Sarah Palin.  It's just that I said, I think I said something like, uh, I'm drunk enough to shit in Sarah 
[02:14:30]  Palin's mouth.  Right.  And I picked her cause why not?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I got her clanging around in my head and started saying everybody should spray  diarrhea in her face or whatever.  I don't know what I said, but I just got, I got into it.  Yeah.  There's a whole network of people like, Louis CK's drunk tweeting again.  And we all fucking jump on and check it out.  And then I think the first time you did it, the next day you had doubts or something cause  you, you wiped out the whole.  I took it all down.  Yeah.  You were like, oh fuck.  I got rid of all these. 
[02:15:00]  Because it wasn't my best work really.  I wasn't worried.  Oh, okay.  I'm not going to run against Sarah Palin in the primaries.  I just, uh, I just looked at it and I'm like, come on.  Is this really what you, and the thing is that stuff you put on the internet and then it  just stays up there.  I don't think you have to just leave it up there.  I, you know, it could have, it could have its moment and then you could take it down.  But they do the Twitter's tweets stay up there.  Yeah.  They're there forever somewhere.  Yeah.  Other people.  The Library of Congress. 
[02:15:30]  The Library of Congress is now taking them and, because this is real important stuff.  99.9% of it is so important.  I'm sure it's some way to tax us.  Yeah.  Somehow there'll be a Twitter tax.  Sure.  We got Louis C.K. in studio and we got James and Westchester on the phone.  James.  Hey.  What's up, James?  I just wanted to say that a few days ago, me and my friends were having some drinks and  he showed me two Louis C.K. YouTube videos and I'm instantly a fan.  And I'm so excited for the show.  Well, which two were they? 
[02:16:00]  The first one was a...  Horse gag.  Tough girl.  That's right.  That wasn't Louie in that video.  And Louie beheading somebody in Iraq.  The first one was a YouTube bit where you're talking about only white people should time  travel.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's not exactly what I said, but...  Yes.  Yes.  It wasn't time travel.  It was vote.  And the second one, I think, was a promo for your new show where you're thinking about 
[02:16:30]  making a porno.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Bobby Cannavale thing.  That's right.  Yeah, that was very, very...  I just want to say, because of those two videos, I'm now so excited for your show.  I'm an interesting fan.  Thank you.  There you go.  So you'll be checking out Louie's new show on FX next Tuesday night at 11 o'clock.  Absolutely.  Everyone else should.  Yeah, I think they should.  I really enjoy it.  I think our audience, especially, is going to love the show.  Yeah, I think they'll like...  I mean, I get to still be very crude on the show, and it's not...  You're being you. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  You know?  I've been amazed by what they let us keep on the air.  There's some nudity, all that's going to stay in there?  Yeah, and I mean, on the Ricky episode, at one point, he says, your cock looks like a  dog was chewing...  was sucking it off.  Yeah.  And then he started chewing on it because he thought it was a blood and cum-filled shoe.  Yeah.  That was the first thing we said, that it went to standards, and I was biting my nails.  And the email that came back was, standards has no requests.  Wow.  I was like, are you serious?  You're in the right place, love. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're in the right place.  Most definitely.  Because, I mean, just because I got these episodes, I'm thinking, okay, some of this  they're going to have to maybe clean up slightly.  No, that's as they're going to air.  And that's how it's going to air.  Right the fuck on.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We've got Louis C.K. in studio.  We'll talk about some other things.  Louis' new show is going to be on FX next Tuesday after Rescue Me at 11 o'clock.  Make sure you check it out.  All right?  That's it?  Very.  All right.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  We're hanging with Louis C.K. today. 
[02:18:00]  Once again, his new show, Louis on FX, next Tuesday is the big premiere at 11 o'clock  right after Rescue Me.  And I've seen the first four episodes.  I want to say it again.  I'm fucking loving this new series from Louis.  Thank you.  And we were discussing during the break, Bill Donahue is up your ass again, huh?  Yeah.  Our old pal.  Yes.  The guy that got us fired made our lives miserable for about two years, three months.  That's not a bout.  I know exactly.  And then he welcomes us back to radio with open arms with a nice little press release, 
[02:18:30]  which actually helped us at the time because everyone was really nervous.  And now he just kind of calls our show.  Right.  I haven't forgotten.  No.  No.  You shouldn't.  No.  I still kind of like, you know, fuck you.  But, uh.  Yeah.  He, uh, I did the Daily Show and I said that the Pope fucks kids.  He got mad.  That'll get him mad.  Yeah.  That'll get him wound up a bit.  Well, don't tell his boss to quit fucking kids.  Don't look at me. 
[02:19:00]  Now, what do you mean by he?  He got in the weather, man.  What do you mean he got mad?  Was he all over TV?  No, he doesn't get that much attention usually.  Oh, he doesn't do TV anymore?  He made a press release on his website that I should not have said that the Pope fucks children and the asshole.  What drives me nuts about Bill Donahue, he'll have a problem with a movie, a TV show, uh, maybe, uh, whatever.  And then we, I'll, I'll ask him flat out, well, did you see the movie?  No, I did not.  No, that's the one last time I was on that he was on.  You know, we, he and I debated on your show. 
[02:19:30]  That's a great YouTube clip.  People love that one.  And he, and he said, uh, I, I asked him about why he said something about Lucky Louie that it was anti-Catholic.  And he said, uh, what, what are you talking about?  And I explained it to him.  He hadn't seen the show.  He wrote the press release, but he hadn't seen it.  Yeah.  He admitted he never saw the show.  No, the amazing defense that he had was, well, do you really think that people like me, heads of groups like mine, actually watch the things that we complain about?  Like, he actually expected people to go like, oh, well, we don't expect you to.  That sounds horrible to people listening in.  No, it's a, I mean, he's telling Catholics, like my grandmother, like that they shouldn't, that they're, they should be offended by something. 
[02:20:00]  And he hasn't fucking seen it.  Never even saw it.  How do you know it's offensive?  I don't know.  It's, it's, it's about as, uh, as phony and, and fucked up a thing for a guy like him to do.  He went after Religious, Religious, I think that's how the Bill Maher movie was called, right?  And, uh, fair enough if, you know, obviously he would have a problem with a movie like that.  But I asked him, did you at least see the movie?  Because he was all over TV yelling and screaming about it. 
[02:20:30]  He goes, no, I didn't, I didn't see it, but my staff did.  Yeah, that's, you should be seeing this stuff that you're on TV complaining about.  So what happened?  He just sent out a press release?  Yeah, that I shouldn't have, shouldn't have said what I said.  And, uh, he wanted some kind of boycott, but it fell.  I don't know what he did.  Some other group wanted to boycott Comedy Central, which who cares, but.  Anything with boy in it.  Jesus.  Those, those wacky.  Ah, God.  He's, he's not quite the, um. 
[02:21:00]  I didn't just say that Pope, the Pope fucks boys either.  I mean, I made a case that he lets other people fuck kids.  Yeah.  And that I think you either are disgusted and horrified by fucking kids or you can't stop doing it.  Was that you that said something like if they found out this was going on at Kmart or, you  know, some other organization, like, like it, if you found out Kmart employees were just  fucking children, there would be a giant investigation on Kmart. 
[02:21:30]  They would go, just go down.  Yeah.  No, the Catholic church would, should at least lose their license at some point.  At least lose their, you know, or you're opening a school whenever you want to license.  Yeah.  The whole paying no taxes for prime real estate in every city in the world thing.  Yeah.  They could at least get that taken down a couple of notches.  There do seem to be a lot of young boys involved with church.  You go to church for anything and there's, you know, young boys holding the candles and 
[02:22:00]  doing things.  It's like, is that, is that really necessary?  And with all the shenanigans that have gone on, it just can we maybe air on the side  of safety and maybe put some, you know, just a few non-Catholic chaperones, ugly Jewish  children.  No, it's, uh, it's, they're, they're, it's bad.  At least you should be able to make fun of them.  Like, that's my feeling about it is that, well, how dare you say that? 
[02:22:30]  Well, cause there's a major boy fucking problem in your organization and at least you're going  to take some shit for it.  Like no one can even say anything.  No, you can't say a word.  All religions though are so fucking like, oh, you can't say that.  It's my religion.  Well, sure I can.  It's not mine.  Yeah.  That's blasphemy.  Not to me.  I'm not Catholic.  Ain't my God.  And by the way, it's not against their God.  It's the fucking Pope who's a human being chosen by other men to be Pope. 
[02:23:00]  It's just an election like fucking, like Chuck Schumer.  Like who gives a shit?  It's had nothing to do with God.  Fucking, no, it's not.  This guy's name is Ratzinger.  He's some dude named Al Ratzinger or whatever his name is.  I mean, he's just a guy.  So when people say like, oh, you're going against God.  Now, who the fuck?  This guy's not God.  No.  He's a fucking guy dressed in gold, in a gold shirt.  Literally like made of gold.  Yeah.  They really don't want anyone saying anything bad about anyone in their religion. 
[02:23:30]  Or you are, yeah, saying something bad about God.  No, the other thing that I get from people about this sort of stuff that kills me is when  they go, well, now say something about Muslims.  Now say something.  You coward.  All right.  Well, I didn't think of a Muslim joke.  Like, why do I have to make a joke up about, do I have to make a joke about Mormons?  Do I have to make, anytime I think about something about one group, is it just, oh, shit, now  I've got to think of 15, otherwise I'm a coward, just to make you happy, you've fucking disgruntled 
[02:24:00]  somebody in their underwear.  When it comes up to have, you know, if I want to make a joke about people sawing other  people's heads off and blowing up their feet to take a plane down, then I'll go with the  Muslim thing.  Yeah, that's when I come up with a funny joke about what dummies they are.  Yeah.  What idiots they are.  And, you know, the Jewish jokes, they write themselves.  Yeah, exactly.  And by the way, the thing with the Muslims is that there's not much to make fun of, because 
[02:24:30]  what they do, they're nailing it.  Yeah, they're really just killing people in their place.  Yeah, let them roll.  Boy, they stink at being terrorists.  No, they're awesome at it.  Hey, what was up with the Father's Day clip?  You made that for somebody?  Oh, see, see.  Everyone said it to me yesterday, but I was traveling.  I was down in Philly for the day.  Just CBS called me and asked me if I would go on the morning, CBS this morning, and just  do a thing about fatherhood. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, you did CBS this morning?  Yeah, so I just went in and did it.  With Charles Osgood.  Yeah, I guess.  I didn't meet any of those people.  But here, across the street.  This is the commercial.  The Flow Max commercial.  Yeah, the commercial.  Now I've got to check this out, because people said it was well done.  It used to really be the Wild West on the internet now.  Fucking internet.  People put commercials on stolen clips now.  Yeah.  You know, like, clips from my special that have been, like, people have just pirated.  I don't care, because it just gets me out there more.  But they have commercials on them. 
[02:25:30]  I had to...  Like, some guy takes a fucking HBO special and puts it on his own YouTube, and you have  to watch a commercial first.  I had to...  I was doing my video podcast thing on livestream.  Yeah.  And then I go on and realize every five minutes, they were stopping the show and popping in  a full-screen commercial.  And it wasn't the same time for everybody watching.  It depended on what time you logged in. 
[02:26:00]  So it wasn't even like I could go, all right, here's another five minutes.  I'll just say, all right, I'll be back in 20 seconds when this commercial's done.  And then you just suddenly go to commercials.  Suddenly, the whole screen goes out, and I come back saying, you know, 20 seconds later,  whatever I'm talking about.  It's like, how the fuck do you expect people to do that?  I pulled right off of it.  I went to Ustream now, because it's like, why am I going to sit there and, you know,  I don't mind the little pop-up strip on the bottom.  You've got to deal with that at times and shit like that.  But that's like, who thought of that lame-ass idea? 
[02:26:30]  And who's going to sit there and keep doing a show when they just cut your show off every  five minutes?  No, that's ridiculous.  And they're making money on you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're making money on you.  Your personal...  Exactly, yeah.  No.  Well, here's Louis C.K. on Father's Day, which obviously was yesterday.  A few days ago, I was leaving a restaurant with my youngest daughter, and I was holding  her hand, and I was texting with this hand.  Yeah, I'm that guy.  A woman walked by, and she gave me a dirty look like, you should pay more attention to your 
[02:27:00]  kid.  Okay, guilty, but I have something to say to that woman.  This is why I'm able to spend time with my kids when I should be at work.  It was noon on a Thursday, okay?  I had a crazy amount of work to do, but my kid graduated from preschool that day, and I  wanted to take her to lunch.  It was a great lunch.  We sat at the same side of the table the way she likes to share a chicken cutlet.  I ate some of her chicken cutlet.  We looked at her drawings.  She told me many stories about the chinchilla in the classroom.  And so now I'm texting, and you walk by, eh, bad father. 
[02:27:30]  What do you know?  Okay, I'm being defensive.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have been texting.  You know, when my kids were younger, I used to avoid them.  I used to sit on the toilet until my legs fell asleep.  You want to know why your father spends so long in the toilet?  Because he's not sure he wants to be a father.  I felt like being a dad was taking away everything I wanted to be, and I was right.  But so what?  What's so great about our lives?  What the hell is an adult without kids?  What's the point? 
[02:28:00]  So I got off the toilet.  I flushed down my personal dreams, and I decided I'm going to be a dad.  I'm not going to be mom's assistant.  That's depressing.  Don't do that if you're a dad.  Just wait for her to write you a list.  Walk around the store staring at it, and call her from the cereal aisle to make sure she  got the right thing.  Be a man.  Make your own list.  Do we need any avocados?  Fathers have skills that they never use at home.  You run a landscaping business, and you can't dress and feed a four-year-old.  Take it on.  Spend time with your kids, and have your own ideas about what they need. 
[02:28:30]  Get into it.  It won't take away your manhood.  It'll give it to you.  I did that.  I spent more time with my kids.  I took it on.  I found out that I'm a pretty bad father.  I make a lot of mistakes.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But my kids love me.  Go figure.  Right on, Louie.  That's fucking good, man.  That's a great spot, too.  Fucking Sunday morning.  I saw on the CBS website where they have that posted, the comments.  This woman wrote a really just angry, angry... 
[02:29:00]  Why?  A bunch of people got mad.  A bunch of people got offended.  I could see that audience kind of not getting you.  Everybody gets offended now about everything.  And there's one line in there that touched off a few people that got really offended because  you just can't say anything negative anymore.  Can you think of what line in there would offend people?  I'm trying to think now because something did hit me when you said it, and I'm thinking...  I'm trying to figure...  It's just me saying, what's the grown-up without kids?  What's the point?  Right, right.  What's the point? 
[02:29:30]  And, uh, well, I happen to not have children, and it's because I couldn't, and how dare you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just like...  This woman wrote a long thing saying, excuse me, but I was married to a man who had a vasectomy  and lied and didn't tell me about it.  And it turns out that before he did, he had an illegitimate child, and then he left me  for that woman, so that comedian owes me $1,000.  So that's my fucking problem?  Yeah, exactly.  She could still adopt.  Right?  Exactly.  If she really wants to be here. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Fuck you.  What's wrong with adopting?  Just because it didn't come out of your smelly cunts.  Your dumpster womb.  A lot of people adopt, you miserable old lady.  That cobweb haunted mansion womb of yours.  And it doesn't want to have the kids, so...  No.  And he wasn't offended by that line, right?  No.  It just has no desire.  I just think, I'm too selfish with my time and stuff like that.  Yeah, it's the choice you make.  I'm terrible.  And who cares?  That's the point of view at the moment that I said it.  Yeah.  It's like, people think that everything you say has to be very well measured and has 
[02:30:30]  to represent everybody's point of view, and like, how dare you state that a childless  person is worthless?  I just fucking said it.  Who gives a shit?  And by the way, yeah, that's like, that's you.  Right.  Yeah, that's what I thought at the time, at the moment.  And who cares?  It's like, well, yeah.  And everyone knows Louie's a great father.  Too bad I can't do a Charles Osgood.  Jordan obviously watches Sunday morning.  I would love to hear Charles Osgood say, up next, comedian Louie C.K. talks about Father's 
[02:31:00]  Day and calls his daughter a cunt.  Oh, God.  And later, death of the American theater.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate those creepy son pictures they put on.  Like the old son with the face and shit.  It's like nightmarish.  I watch Sunday morning.  I like the heebie-jeebies from things like that.  It's an easy watch in the morning.  Yeah.  On Sundays.  No stress.  Nah.  Someone that collects teapots.  Yeah.  And they're going through our house.  The story before me was Bill Gates and his father and how they're such good pals. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, really?  Fantastic.  Easy to watch.  Yeah.  It must be easy to be pals with a fucking billionaire.  They're smiling.  They're all smiling.  Billionaire.  Yeah, exactly.  The father's like, you know, hey, my son, he's not a complete fuck-up.  He's made billions of dollars.  Trillions.  I'm sure they get along great.  Yeah.  Yeah, no kidding.  I don't know why rich people ever fight.  Why would you fight?  Why would you fight?  Isn't like money the thing that everyone fights over?  Yeah, it makes all the difference.  If you're rich, you just go up.  It's like money doesn't buy happiness.  Yeah, but it sure pays for a lot of badness.  I just always imagine the rich people and families fighting. 
[02:32:00]  It's like, fuck you.  Oh, well, let's go buy a castle and go fix it up.  Eat some gold.  And everybody's okay again.  How was Father's Day, Lou?  Your daughters do anything special for you?  No.  They're not really at that age yet.  Well, they're eight and five.  They should be at that age.  They should be doing something for you.  Yeah, nothing.  What makes you warm inside?  Nothing?  I got fucked.  Nothing.  I had my first Father's Day yesterday. 
[02:32:30]  That's great, man.  And I didn't realize it turns into like a second birthday for you.  Yeah, it's great.  It's awesome.  I was getting cards from all.  A second birthday.  It is, though.  I was getting lottery tickets.  I was getting cash.  I got gifts.  I got cards from people.  I'm like, why are you giving me a Father's Day card?  That's great.  People came out of the woodwork.  I don't know why people outside of your family do it.  I don't know why.  It was everyone that was a father.  I mean, I told my kids when I was yelling at them for forgetting it. 
[02:33:00]  Fathers and Mother's Day is because we take care of them, you know?  Right.  So that's why we get a little more than just our birthday.  Yeah.  It's because we take care of them.  And I think your wife should give you something for Father's Day.  She did.  She did.  Great.  Because, you know, you're appreciating each other.  Sure.  Your roles in the household.  But other people outside the house, why would they give a shit?  But then her grandparents gave me something.  Wow.  My wife's mom gave me something.  Well, it's your first one.  You won't get one next year.  Probably not.  I think they wanted to make it a little special, which was awesome.  Next year, nothing. 
[02:33:30]  And life's weird because the last five Father's Day days were, like, the worst day of the  year for me.  Yeah, because you're dead.  My pop's gone.  So it went from, like, ugh, I just want to, like, let this day.  Well, that's an interesting thing about how life, the cycle of life.  Yes, sir.  And then also it's a cool day again.  That's fucked up.  I got in right under the wire, too, because him being a new dad, I was like, fuck, like  8.30 at night, I'm like, hey, happy Father's Day, Hopi.  Hope it was good.  It was definitely.  I was like, whoosh, whoosh, under the wire. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, no, I was mad at my kids for forgetting, and then I thought, should I call my dad?  And I thought, fuck that, I'm not calling him.  But I didn't call him.  I was just surprised you thought of me outside the show.  I was like, wow, Jesus.  Thanks, man.  Well, because I was thinking it's like Father's Day, because then everybody was pretty much  leaving the house, and it gave me time to think for a second.  I'm like, oh, yeah, new fathers.  There's a few of them.  Like stupid Travis.  I, you know.  Well.  With his beard and his kid, trying to hide that he's gay. 
[02:34:30]  What are you doing here?  You really went the distance, didn't you?  Had a kid and everything.  Yeah, I'm all in.  I had to, uh, uh, never mind.  Well, now I have to.  Now you have to.  I, uh, I had to leave my kid for the first time yesterday.  I fucking, all of a sudden got teary-eyed.  Yeah, I'll admit it.  I got teary-eyed.  And everyone's like, you faggy.  I know.  In front of a house full of people down in Philly.  Tough, tough.  There's some tough people in that house.  Oh, you mean you're going to be away from the kid for a while?  For a couple days, because, you know, she's visiting family down there.  I have to.  Philly, did they throw beer on you and fucking batteries? 
[02:35:00]  Right.  Throwing batteries as I'm trying to leave the house.  Philly.  I'm like, oh, and I go, oh, this is what this is about.  Like, it finally hit me.  Like, oh, fuck.  Okay.  Yeah, I know, because you've been with this person their whole life, so.  Six weeks.  Yeah.  It's their whole life.  I'm at the point, because it's only six weeks, I'm convinced we're just babysitting.  Yeah.  I'm waiting for the parents to show up.  I'm like, oh, okay, that was nice that I was babysitting for six weeks.  Yeah, that's what that's like.  I'm only starting to realize, wait a minute, this is.  No, so I remember when my ex-wife gave birth. 
[02:35:30]  She wasn't my ex-wife then.  She was still my wife.  Yeah.  We were divorced before the baby was born.  Right.  All that happens.  Hell yeah.  I knew a guy, a writer, I worked on the Cedric the Entertainer show, and this writer, James,  he was, he had three kids, and he said, oh, when my wife gets pregnant, I just leave the  house.  I just leave for a while until the baby's born, then I come back.  Holy shit.  Really?  And I was like, seriously?  What the hell is that?  He goes, because I was talking about how I was struggling in my marriage with, you know, 
[02:36:00]  the new baby and all that stuff, and he goes, oh, yeah, well, when my wife gets pregnant,  I just leave because she gets really, you know, hard to deal with.  So I just leave, and then come back when the baby's already even born.  Wow.  And I'm like, how the fuck do you, because I'm like, how did you get away with that?  He's like, well, what's she going to do?  She doesn't want to raise the kids by herself.  That's an amazing, wow, to totally use your leverage to leave, and she's probably throwing  shit out of him, just furious.  He didn't divorce her.  He'd just leave.  He'd go get an apartment somewhere to, you know, stay with friends. 
[02:36:30]  And then he comes back, and she's like, I can't believe you left.  And he's like, all right, well, you want me to just, you want to divorce me or what?  No, but you shouldn't have done that.  Yeah, ooh, whatever.  Wow.  There's some people that run their relationship that way.  When I was married.  Fucking genius.  It is.  It works.  It was smart on his part.  Yeah.  When I was married, my wife at one point really wanted children, and I really did not.  Yeah.  You faked it that you wanted children, though. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  I remember those days.  I was like, yeah, all right.  No, I was going along with it like I did with everything else in my life back then.  And I just went along, I was, don't make waves, Anthony, status quo, let's just, you know,  never fucking actually bring up your opinion of how you feel about something.  Ugh.  I just want to smack myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was just terrible.  Time machine, man.  We're going back and smacking our own selves.  I know.  I want to go back and just punch myself in the face.  Well, you get in these relationships where you just feel, like, forced into certain behavior.  You're on a track.  Yeah, you just can't change. 
[02:37:30]  The second you get engaged, you're on a track that just, you have no more control over.  So she wanted to have kids.  Um, and it was time to like, now she said, no, we're doing this now.  I'm taking prenatal vitamins and I'm doing this and that.  So I'm like, all right, I have to fake coming.  Oh my God.  I would fuck her.  Oh my God.  And I would make all the sounds, the faces, the moves and, and make believe I came really  fucking shoved it in. 
[02:38:00]  And then I'd lay there a while.  I wouldn't just pull right out.  You could think it got absorbed.  Yeah.  It absorbed up.  It fucking went wherever it goes.  Oh my God.  And I would sit there and, uh, yeah.  And then just be like, go in the bathroom, jerk off, put little fucking Anthony Jr. down  the toilet bowl.  Oh my God.  She never, cause I didn't want to have kids, but she didn't realize when she didn't feel  all squishy.  No, sometimes they're not squishy.  If you, if you, if you come real deep and you fucking stay there a while, she's pretty 
[02:38:30]  stupid and she was still, you know, with that whole thing.  I know you're contractually not allowed to say it, but she was a dumb cunt.  It's like, didn't you guys, uh, I'm not, I'm not in your divorce agreement.  Fuck her.  Stupid whore.  Fucking manipulative cunt.  Trying to make a man have a baby when you didn't want one.  It's about time.  Fucking stupid.  Am I, uh, stupid.  Didn't you?  Oh, we went to the, uh, the fertility specialist.  They went to the fertility specialist because they thought something was wrong.  And the specialist said, well, your husband has to actually ejaculate. 
[02:39:00]  Inside you.  Oh my God.  We're finding the problem is.  Oh, he put my fucking shit.  There hasn't been a sperm in your body since 1975.  He, uh, he put my shit under a slide.  It looked like fucking nuclear reaction.  The shit was flying all over the place.  Oh my God.  Swimming like crazy.  Looked like LA after the Lakers won the championship.  Oh yeah.  Perfectly shaped little sperm heads that could just puncture an egg.  It was great.  And then it's like, I don't know what the problem is. 
[02:39:30]  Wow.  And there I am fucking sexually frustrated.  How many times did you fuck her that way do you think?  It was, it was every time she felt she was ovulating.  Oh my God.  And, uh.  Did you guys have a lot of sex back then?  No.  I wasn't either.  It was strictly for her getting pregnant.  So I would just not.  I don't know.  Not cum.  That's awful.  And then I'd piss her off sometimes and be fucking that I'd pull out and come on her  stomach.  Jesus.  She'd be like, what are you, what are you doing?  Look at all that.  Yeah, we're supposed to do.  Ah, what a waste. 
[02:40:00]  I forgot.  That's gold.  I forgot you were trying to get pregnant.  Oh.  I forgot.  It slipped out.  Wow, that's, that's twisted though, Ant.  Yeah, well I didn't want the things you'll do.  I did not want a fucking kid.  That's for sure.  Thank God I didn't have one.  Every time you're in a relationship where you're like complaining to a friend about unhappiness  and the friend goes, why don't you just tell her?  Something like that.  Yeah.  And you go, oh no.  That's, maybe that's how you do stuff. 
[02:40:30]  That means you're in a bad, you're in a bad place.  Yeah.  That means you're in a bad place.  That means you should not be in that relationship.  You should be able to, wherever you are in a relationship, you should be able to turn  to the person you're with and say, this stinks.  Yeah.  I hate this.  This is a bad thing.  And even if it's not an easy thing to say, you should be able to say it and absorb it  and deal with it.  How about this one when you finally do break up and everyone around you goes, yeah, we all  knew.  Oh, really?  I saw that coming a mile away.  It's like, thanks, you couldn't have saved me five or six fucking years.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  How about you speak up?  Why are you around me?  Well, what do you do?  That's a good question though.  If you have a friend who's in a bad relationship and they really, and they fight, well, you  know what?  And they probably did say, hey, are you sure?  That's cool that she talks to you like that.  No, no, no.  It's see.  And there's a whole thing where it's offset by this.  And then they go, all right, well, you got to wait for a cue though, from them.  You can't just step in and bad mouth this chick or something.  She's a bitch, man.  You got to leave and you lose a friend.  But the second you get an inkling that they're not happy, that's your duty now as a friend 
[02:41:30]  to step in and go, look, here's the deal.  If you're even considering not doing this, don't fucking do it.  Where were you when I needed you?  Where the fuck was anybody when I needed them?  Yeah, we fucked up.  It's a hard thing to do.  And then it ends and they go, well, it's about time.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks.  You couldn't fucking maybe have somebody write a note, your thoughts, but someone else's  handwriting and just fucking leave it in my car one day?  Yeah, leave some anonymous. 
[02:42:00]  Leave some photos of the girl with fucking ten black guys.  Make me want to leave.  Right.  Help me out here.  I had a friend who was dating, he had a girlfriend.  And one day he just woke up.  This is the way he tells the story.  He woke up and he got out of bed and didn't know why he was doing this.  He just walked to her house, rang the doorbell and found one of his best friends.  Wow.  He just had an inkling.  And he thinks that it's some sort of weird, like. 
[02:42:30]  Psychic thing?  Yeah.  But what it was was they were clearly fucking for ages.  And his body, like, grabbed him by the collar and said, idiot, just look at this.  It's happening every day.  It's happening.  How dumb are you?  Which I haven't noticed.  But he thinks it's like this one time they fucked and he.  He's crushing it all of a sudden.  Incredibly picked up on it.  Damn.  Nothing worse than being cheated on if you do, like, care about somebody.  Yeah.  Although, I don't think I cared about the person, but I was, that whole infatuation thing 
[02:43:00]  I used to get myself caught up in.  Yeah.  Infatuation with that love disguise on.  Mm-hmm.  Infatuation can dress like love.  And it walks around and you're like, it's love.  And then you're like, holy shit, that's infatuation.  Yep.  And there's a girl and then she ends up with, like, one of my best friends.  Which is just like, well, can you just take one guy in between me and my best friend?  You just, it's easy for you to fuck.  Go to a bar, find anonymous guy. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  And then, like, ease into my best friend shit.  Yeah, you got the pussy.  You can get laid any time you want.  Because now I don't have you or my best friend.  Because I can't hang out with him.  No.  Because he's fucking you.  No.  It's, like, terrible.  I was, uh, when I was writing at Conan, there was a woman that worked in the office and we  were fucking around.  Like, we would just fuck once in a while.  And I liked her, but we didn't mostly, we just fucked occasionally.  And one night she went to, we went to dinner and she said, I don't want to do this anymore  because I want a serious relationship. 
[02:44:00]  And I want to be with somebody, you know, have a real companion.  And I was like, wow.  And I hadn't had a girlfriend in a long time.  And I said, so you're saying you want to make the next step?  And I was like, well, I, I like you.  Yeah.  We should be.  Oh, no.  And I said, yeah, let's be together.  Okay.  And I was kind of really excited.  Wow.  It's, I kind of have a girlfriend now.  And yeah.  Okay.  And she was like, it's something weird about the way she was acting as I was saying all  this.  She was like, yeah, okay.  And then the next day I go to work and she's, no, she's going out with another writer. 
[02:44:30]  She meant, she was starting to say, I wanted a serious relationship.  So I'm going out with this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I started saying all this shit and she just let me train wreck into saying, so now  you and I are together.  And she's like, all right.  And the next day she's with him and they got, they got married.  Wow.  I was like, I just felt like an idiot.  Well, we got the phones lit on this topic.  Brian and Marilyn, we're hanging with Louis CK, by the way.  Let's get another plug in.  Louis next Tuesday.  It's his new show on FX. 
[02:45:00]  Saw the first four episodes.  I think the audience is going to love this one.  11 o'clock next Tuesday on FX.  Brian, what do you got?  Hey, just classic how it was talking about, you know, everyone doesn't like whoever you  hear about it after the fact.  Well, I was married seven damn years.  Found out that everyone in my family hated her.  No one had the balls to tell me.  And you know what's bad?  When your grandmother even hates her.  You know. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, they never have an opinion.  You're supposed to love everybody.  Come to find out my grandmother didn't even like her.  I was like, Jesus Christ, can anybody just tell me?  Yeah, you realize that the whole family was like, every time you'd leave the room with  the girl, they would be like, oh, fuck that bitch.  They don't want to lose that thing to talk about.  Families love that.  Yeah, they love the little fucking...  Families love having somebody that marries in that they hate.  I think Louis made a good point, though.  You don't know what to do.  I mean, it's a tough situation.  It's rough.  Especially when you're younger, because you don't have the experience. 
[02:46:00]  As you get older, you just start realizing, I don't give a fuck.  Oh, no.  I'm going to be honest and say what I feel.  No, exactly.  And I tell people...  I've met people that I know five minutes, and I'm like, yeah, no, you've got to leave  her.  Yeah, but when she's pregnant, that doesn't matter.  Yeah, no, get out.  Get out, leave now.  The younger people you let, you just let be, because you know they're going to figure it  out themselves.  Let them crash and burn themselves.  It's when they're in their 30s.  You're like, dude, what the fuck?  But that goes with everything, like even relationships now.  I find myself not trying so hard to juggle and be dishonest. 
[02:46:30]  No, no, you've got to do that.  Now I'm just honest guy, and I'll say like, yeah, this is what's going on.  Yeah.  There have been many times I've said, I'm not boyfriend material guy anymore.  Yeah.  I'm just not.  I've been wrecked.  I've been wrecked on relationships, and I've said this.  You were boyfriend guy for 20 years.  I mean, married in there, but boyfriend guy for that.  Since I've been 14 years old and had my first girlfriend, I have been in a relationship 
[02:47:00]  that has lasted a while, and they usually overlapped.  You know, I'd be like, oh, I found another girl, this one, that one, that, until I realized,  you know, I'm in my 40s, and I just got out of the relationship with Melinda that lasted  like eight years, and then I just decided, you know what?  Fuck this.  Yeah.  And then you get together with a girl, you start talking, and you try to tell them how  you feel, and they're, at first, they were just like, absolutely, that's exactly how 
[02:47:30]  I feel.  Yeah.  I don't want the relationship, this, we're just having fun, we'll do that.  A week, two weeks later, you notice, like, the relationship things start coming into  play.  The text and the little snide comments, the claws come out, the thing, and then you realize,  and I'll say, this is starting to resemble something I don't like.  Right.  You know, and the reason I'm not seeing you all the time is because I like that spontaneity. 
[02:48:00]  I like, the second something becomes routine and a relationship, it sucks.  The sex will start sucking, it'll get mundane and repetitive, and if you don't see someone  for a week or two weeks, you want to fucking, like, ravage them, you know?  So, why wreck it by having us have to sit next to each other and watch TV every night?  Yeah, no, if it's not what you want, then it's not what you want.  Yeah.  It's not bringing any kind of comfort. 
[02:48:30]  I think a most bad relationship serves because somebody's doing that that doesn't really want  to.  Right.  They're in it and don't want to be.  But they don't want to completely lose the other person, so they play it.  No, when I was, it's great when you get older and more honest, you don't care.  Yeah, then you don't.  After I got divorced, one of the first girls that I dated, we went out a few times, and then  one day, we were out in front of my building, and it was in the middle of the day, and she  kissed me, like, kind of passionately, and it was daylight, and I was standing where I  usually am walking with my kids in a stroller, and I hadn't had a thing with anybody, and 
[02:49:00]  it just brought home to me, like, I'm kind of with somebody, this is what this is.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't like it.  And then the next day, she was on the phone with me, and she's like, is there something  weird, getting a weird vibe from you?  And my old me would have said, no, no, no, what do you mean, no, totally, like, you  know what it is, is that I was thinking about this thing, but no, you're awesome.  And why is that?  But I didn't, I just went, yeah, you got a weird vibe, because we kissed on the street,  and it made me realize, I gotta stop seeing you. 
[02:49:30]  I'm not, I can't do, I'm not at a point in my life where this is a good thing to do,  and I wanna stop.  And there was, like, this silence, and then she went, thank you very much.  Wow!  That was so much easier than Amelia, like, first she was really stunned.  She liked the honesty, though.  She was like, thank God for a guy who just fucking says it, instead of making, because  I could have, I would have hung in there for, like, six months.  Exactly!  Of not enjoying a moment with her. 
[02:50:00]  Same fucking situation.  Because I didn't want to come out and say, this is not good.  You're great, but, well, not great enough for me to hang out with her anymore, because  that's always the underlying thing that you don't want to say.  I don't know why that snap judgment thing makes you go, no, no, it's not you, it's like,  your body just starts talking.  Well, it's like you're in trouble with your mom.  Anthony, do you not wanna fuck me anymore?  No!  No, mom, I wanna fuck you all day!  I'm sorry, mommy!  Now that's good, you fuck my pussy.  Very good!  We got lots of great phone calls coming in. 
[02:50:30]  It's one of those situations, you do, you get older, and, but the bad thing about it  is you never want to sound cliche, and that whole, this point in my life, it just sounds  like...  Yeah, I try to say it in the blunt, like, the thing I try to do now with every relationship  or even moment with somebody in the street is whatever is in my mouth, I try to say exactly  what I feel without being polite.  If you try to say it politely, it comes out sounding like a bad chick flick line. 
[02:51:00]  Well, because it sounds like you're covering what's real, and what's real is not as bad  as you think.  The fact that you're covering makes her think that there's something much worse.  It makes her think that you just are grossed out by her, you don't like her, she's not  attractive, and so you're making something up.  Whereas really, you're just being a coward.  You're just being honest.  I don't want to do this.  I don't want to do this.  I got a gut feeling.  I don't like it.  I'm going home.  I want to stop now.  Yeah, I want to stop.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's exactly it, though.  I'm done with the thing of talking to you. 
[02:51:30]  You guys are the exception, though, obviously.  Well, we got to the exception through divorce.  Oh, yeah.  The exception came very late in life.  I'm just saying that's so hard.  It sounds great, but it's so hard for most people to do.  It shouldn't be.  If you do it every minute, then you don't.  I mean, there's like a million stupid Mark Twainy-type quotes about if you would never  lie, you always don't have to remember anything.  If you always tell the truth, you never have to remember anything.  Yeah, when you start lying, it's, oh, shit.  You just start creating a...  Let me grab this.  I'm a bad liar. 
[02:52:00]  There's a lot of people in marriages who are like, I shouldn't be in this, but how long  could I possibly live?  They're not resigning themselves to death.  Let me grab this call.  I don't want to lose this guy.  He's miserable.  Maybe we can help him out.  Jim in Staten Island.  Jim.  Oh, man.  This is Jimmy Greco, listener number three from a very long time ago.  Oh, right on, Jimmy Greco.  I remember you.  Yeah, what's up, boys?  I'm in a miserable marriage with a miserable fat cunt.  The only thing she does is...  The only interaction she has with me is, what's your check look like? 
[02:52:30]  Okay?  I fucking, the minute I turn around and I go to go stand up for myself, I used to have  a substance problem.  So right away, are you using...  It's just a miserable fucking existence.  I don't want to fucking leave, but I have a beautiful four-year-old son.  And I don't want to leave this boy with this sick fucking cunt.  Okay?  I jerk off more now than I ever did before.  This morning, as I'm getting ready to work, I said, let me throw eggs in that check.  And let me look for something to beat the fuck off to. 
[02:53:00]  Beat the fuck off to.  Well, listen to this poor guy.  I know.  He's just miserable.  How is your check?  And are you drinking?  Yeah.  That's what I want to know.  I've had a drink or a drug in fucking 109 days.  And I said, now I want to go on.  109 days.  Wow.  109 days.  When you're saying fucking 109 days, you better go to a meeting.  You need a meeting now.  You're not going to make 115, sir.  Hey, it also says she beat you.  Is that true?  Well, she's taking a couple of swings in here right now. 
[02:53:30]  I don't want to put her through a fucking world.  Did you ever hit her?  No.  No.  I did a call to her once.  She fucking ran into the bathroom, and I fucking popped open the door, and then she  sank down to the ground, and I said, don't you ever fucking raise your fucking head to  me again.  Okay?  Why?  All right.  Listen, listen.  That's your...  That sounds like a treat.  I thought this four-year-old is having a ball or something.  These people sound awesome.  He wasn't on when this shit happened. 
[02:54:00]  Now, Jim, that's...  All right.  Listen, I'm going to jump in.  That's your side of the story, and I believe every word of it.  Now, why would she stay in this thing, then, Lou?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know why.  Some people...  There's always one people...  Like, she obviously is miserable, too.  There's always one person in a bad relationship who's perfectly happy to be in a bad relationship.  There's always one person who's, like, who's fine with it, who's fine with just constant  shitty...  Yeah.  The only thing I would say to you, sir, is that you're not going to lose your kid if you  leave this woman.  You get to keep the kid. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  But you want to know what's up?  I don't want him to have that in the back of his mind.  You know, now he's...  You're a coward.  Now, the other way to look at it is your son's learning that if somebody...  Who just called me a coward?  Jim, just calm down.  You're calling a comedy show.  Please try to remember that.  Jim, this isn't this kind of show.  We're doing the best we can.  I have no problem saying it, Jim.  I hope he said it.  Because I was there.  I was a coward, too.  Like, why are you staying? 
[02:55:00]  First of all, I don't want to lose half my shit.  That's something...  Well, that's a very good answer.  We've talked about that on the show a lot.  It's not a good reason to stay.  It's a good question.  I don't want to leave my kid, number three.  What the fuck do I do?  The only person who's going to win is...  People procrastinate.  People don't pay their bills on time.  You're going to fucking file for divorce.  You know what a pain in the ass it is?  No, it's a huge pain in the ass.  To get a lawyer and all that shit.  To get it started.  The two things.  I don't want to lose my kid. 
[02:55:30]  I don't want to lose half my shit.  I mean, they're both beatable.  Because, first of all, you have this idea that your kid's going to grow up thinking my dad left us.  Because, it'll be true if you leave the classic way of just, like, take off.  Deadbeat dad.  And just show up once a week to take your kid to an awkward fucking Little League game.  They have nothing to say to you.  I remember seeing this father with his daughter, and it was so clear that it was, like, a visitation.  Yeah.  And they were walking down the street, and he goes,  Well, we got two hours left. 
[02:56:00]  What do you want to do?  And she goes, I don't know.  It was so depressing.  He really gave this thought.  Yeah, so it's not, that's a shitty father who divorced and then just kind of marginalized their kid.  But if you fight for your right to be with your kid, and you fight for your custody time,  then what your kid will, because if you don't do that,  the thing you teach your kid is that if a person is abusive to you, you stay with them anyway.  It's not a good signal to give a kid is that if you're in a shit marriage with a bad person,  or you're a bad person, that these guys stay together. 
[02:56:30]  So that isn't, so I don't buy that you're not going to keep your kid.  The kid's aware.  Jim, the kid's aware that it's a nightmare.  The kid's living in a house of misery.  Right.  So if you separate, then both of you become happier people,  and the kid lives in two homes that are happier than one shit home.  So that's a plus for the kid.  And then as far as half your shit, well, fucking be a man and raise twice the money.  Just work harder.  I mean, really, it's that, I liked the fact that, I mean, I'm paying shit to my ex 
[02:57:00]  because she didn't have a job when we split up.  But I go, it puts me at zero, and then it just motivates me.  I work much harder now because I've got, and anyway, I had to take care of her before.  And it actually, if you look at it this way, it reduces your nut with the other person to a check.  You have one check that you write.  I mean, it's not like that.  When you're married, it's not like that.  You fight over money.  She spends whatever she wants.  She's got your bank book. 
[02:57:30]  But once you get divorced, you write one check, and it's contained to that.  It's not what it is.  And you call that zero.  You just move the zero line in your mind to after she's gotten hers.  That's exactly how I rationalized it.  That's, and then you go zero.  Now I got, I was happy to give away whatever I had so that I could be at a clean me zero.  Then when I, if I raise 10 bucks, I spend eight of it on Snickers bars.  Can I ask your question about that, though?  Shove the ninth dollar up my ass.  It's my business.  If you didn't have the kids, that would be a tough check to write, though. 
[02:58:00]  Like, in Ann's case, he had to write that check, and he had no connection with her.  Like, you didn't have kids that he loved or any of that shit.  You know what I mean?  Like, with you, you almost could rationalize it.  Like, well, because of my relationship with her, I got these two beautiful daughters.  Oh, child support and alimony are two totally different things.  But it makes it a little easier to write her the check.  I'm just saying, I don't know.  Or does it?  Well, child support is, yeah, I mean, it's just a totally different category.  Child support is something that you pay until the kids are 21 years old. 
[02:58:30]  But I'm saying the actual check to her is a little easier, because you know you had the kids with her.  But in Anthony's case, just writing to a check.  Oh, I did not want to write that check.  Yeah, no, it's totally easier.  Didn't want to write that check.  The best check was the last check.  That was when it was all done.  And then I was like, oh, I got a raise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Jim, did we help you out there?  You made me feel a little bit better.  Actually, Lewis made me feel better, because he lost a lot more than I could ever lose. 
[02:59:00]  So, you know.  All right.  And I'm sorry I called you a coward, but I've been there.  I was in a relationship I should have got out of, safe to say, six years before I did.  All right, boy, I got to tell you this.  Congratulations on your son.  Thank you.  And enjoy him as much as you can.  And, and, and...  Here's the sappy part.  And you're a fucking gift, man.  I mean, I love my boy more than anything.  All he wants to do is play weed, cuddle, and fucking just hang out.  And, and, and I love him.  And I, I, I just can't... 
[02:59:30]  If you get, if you get, if you get divorced and you fight for, uh, time with your kid,  you'll have that time with, with your kid by yourself.  And you'll thank fucking shit Christ for that.  Or whoever you pray to.  Good luck with your new show, man.  Good luck with your new show.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, it's gonna be a great one, Jim.  All right.  And, wow, now, uh, we've just turned into a relationship show.  Look at these fucking...  Yeah, that happens.  We could take a break and take more phone calls.  We could do that.  Louie, is it sticking around or you got to go?  Yeah, I'm here for another 45 minutes or so. 
[03:00:00]  Perfect, man.  All right.  Louie C.K. in studio.  His new show, Louie, on FX.  Next Tuesday night at 11 o'clock.  Definitely make sure you, you check it out.  All right?  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  Louie C.K. in studio. 
[03:00:30]  Louie C.K. on Twitter, by the way.  He's a good one to follow.  And what do we get on louieck.net?  Anything?  Anything good?  I never...  You don't even update anymore.  I got to start.  I used to love my website.  It's just a lot of work.  Right now, the old thing with the Bobby Conner Valley thing is still up there.  It's still up there.  There's tour dates from April.  I see that.  All right.  None of this is updated.  This shouldn't even be on the one sheet, Steve.  Yeah, no.  I mean, I'd like to have the website more active. 
[03:01:00]  I used to like it.  I used to like putting stuff up there.  How was the brokerage?  Brokerage was awesome.  I was on Long Island.  I was trying to get away from the baby thing.  Oh, I had such a good time there.  We're just not...  I can't separate yet.  No, sure.  I got to be right in there for a little longer.  No, of course.  I mean, but I was trying to get away.  She was cool with it.  She was like, go see Louie.  She was jealous because she loves you.  And I don't know.  A poopy diaper, a scream, and a fucking bottle feeding later.  No, no.  You got plenty of the rest of your life to do that. 
[03:01:30]  It's not that long that it ends up being.  Everyone says about three months, right?  Is that about it?  Yeah, I don't know.  I think...  Where it gets easier.  It starts to a little bit.  They stop being a critical, like a critical case.  Yeah.  The kid starts having a little bit of a rhythm.  But they go up and down.  You're going to have plenty of tough times.  I feel like I'm in the emergency room every night.  Yeah.  It's kind of like that.  It's like it's touch and go every night.  When does this end, Louie?  I'm like that.  Chill me out.  No, a lot of it is...  He knows.  A lot of it is your perception, too.  Like, I remember when we first had our baby, the doctor said,  if she cries and you just can't make her stop crying, call the doctor. 
[03:02:00]  Like, if she's really totally out of control, can't stop crying.  And so one night, the baby was crying and crying.  And I said, I think this is it.  We've got to call the doctor.  She just...  This has been...  You know...  So I called the doctor to something.  It was like the fucking midnight.  And the doctor says, how long has she been crying?  And we looked at each other.  I'm like, five minutes.  They were talking like an hour or something.  I felt after five minutes, like, this is totally a disaster. 
[03:02:30]  Not going to stop.  It's just perception.  You just get used to stuff.  I'm used to it now.  Yeah, it's more what's going on inside of you than the baby knows exactly what it's doing.  The baby's a genius.  But they don't teach you shit in the hospital.  You're there for two days.  No, of course not.  Teach us some real shit.  Like, they don't tell you that the kid will make some really fucked up noises in the middle of night,  which you will be convinced is something horrible.  Yeah.  And it's just normal.  It's like Jay Moore explains in his book.  It's like you're living in a zoo or something.  There's a lot of animal noises coming from the crib.  They don't tell you that.  I thought it was a snore or a cry. 
[03:03:00]  That's all you're worrying about.  Yeah, I know.  These weird fucked up noises.  It doesn't breathe right at first because it's still figuring out its lungs.  They don't tell you this stuff.  Oh, that's pretty creepy.  But now a lot of those noises we hear, we're like, oh, okay.  That's what that is.  That's the, yeah.  Yeah, parents are learning.  That's what they're, it's all, the kid's raising you, really.  I mean, the kid knows, the kid develops at its own pace.  Yeah.  But you have a learning curve.  And not as many feedings, so we're good.  We're starting to sleep a little bit. 
[03:03:30]  Knock on wood.  It'll change.  The ride.  It changes again?  It'll get bad again, yeah.  It always does.  What are you talking about?  And the kid has growth spurts.  They'll have growth spurts where they just constantly feed.  Does she breastfeed the kid?  Yeah.  So there'll be times where she'll start just saying, this fucking kid is chewing the shit  out of my nipple.  I can't take it.  It gets really, really hard.  And then there'll be like, she could get her nipple, get raw or infected, all kinds  of stuff.  It just gets, it's just, then she'll have to pump breast milk because she's making too  much and the kid's not feeding enough. 
[03:04:00]  Holy shit.  If the kid's not eating enough and there's been, her breasts get bloated.  So she has to pump the breast milk out and then you have these rotting little jars of  breast milk around the house.  It's always been there.  Oh, God.  Damn.  It's just so many things.  If you have, do you have a dog?  No, no.  No, we had our dog, when our dog got mad, like dogs will punish you, you know, like if  you leave them at home too long, we'd come home, the dog would go through the baby's  diapers and spread baby shit all over the house. 
[03:04:30]  Shit like that.  And you'd come home, motherfucker!  Fucker!  Just screaming at the dog.  I could not imagine that.  The baby's crying.  You know, it gets tough.  It's endurance.  Boy, I was looking for a little hope here today.  And then the teeth come in and that fucking hurts.  And then the teeth fall out.  Okay, I get it.  And then the new teeth come in.  I get it.  I actually brought this up hoping you weren't going to help me out today.  No, it's, well, you get used to it is what happens.  You get immune to it and then it just becomes what you do.  It's all good.  Yeah.  It becomes what you do.  No, so far, so good. 
[03:05:00]  I'm fucking, I'm loving it.  So, but yeah, the brokerage is a good club.  Yeah, I really, I was dying because I haven't seen you in a while.  I'm like, fuck.  And it was right there.  I like those Long Island rooms.  They're fun.  Just don't like getting out there, right?  The traffic, by the way.  Ah, that's too, that's too local.  We can move on.  No, it's insane.  I know.  I hate that.  To get to New York City to Long Island is just.  That's a little bottleneck of one road.  Yeah.  It takes all night.  All right, let's go back to the phones.  Jeff in Jersey hanging with Louis C.K. today. 
[03:05:30]  That was a great setup, Jeff.  Let's go.  Hello.  Hey.  How are you?  Great.  That doesn't matter.  Hey, no, I just wanted to, I just wanted to make a comment about that guy who was staying  with his marriage because of his son.  I'm a long-time listener, and I used to listen to Anthony about his nightmare stories in his  wedding, and it felt like he was talking about myself.  And I would say the same thing.  I wanted to stay for my kids.  And they got to an age where one day one of my kids turns to me and says, Dad, you and 
[03:06:00]  Mom are never going to get along, huh?  Because we are so unhappy that you guys are together.  And it really woke me up to realize that, yeah, me and my wife were miserable with each  other.  And when I was upstairs, she was downstairs.  I was in the kitchen.  She was in the living room, totally avoiding each other, never doing anything together as  a family with the kids.  So I neglected to realize that me, miserable, my wife, miserable, made the household miserable, 
[03:06:30]  the kids were miserable.  Yeah, that's what happens.  I'm fucking trotting around the house with my father throwing spaghetti at the wall.  This thing of trying to stay together, if it's not working, I mean, if you feel like  when you have a fight, you get somewhere, I think that's the key.  It's like, how do you know whether to stick in there?  I think if you feel like after you have a fight, you just made it, you know, made it  an opportunity to open up, you know, like you go, okay, look, I get it. 
[03:07:00]  And you see a little more of the other, if you feel like you see the other person's point  of view.  But if you leave, if you have a fight with your wife or husband, and you're now in the  other room going, fucking, fucking, fucking, and you just had to get away from each other  because it got that bad.  Even that, that happens.  But if that's chronic, then it's like, yeah, I don't think it, there's nothing wrong if  you look at it from like a biological National Geographic, you know, how lions mate and that  kind of thing.  If the idea that we come together as a couple, you cohabitate, you build a home, you have 
[03:07:30]  children, you raise the children past a certain critical point, and then you separate and raise  the children in two separate homes, what the fuck is wrong with that?  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with that, and that's where I came to realize a long time, 10 years  into a nightmare of a marriage, and I finally came to realize when my kid was finally old  enough to say that to me, and I was like, you know what, they're right. 
[03:08:00]  And I started the proceedings, I filed for divorce, and you know what, now everybody's happy.  When the kids are with me, they're happy, I'm happy, I get to enjoy them, appreciate  them, make memories with them, and they do the same thing with the mother.  I call up to say goodnight, I talk to them, see how the school was or whatever, and they're  telling me, yeah, we did this with mommy, we did that with mommy, and so I see a totally  big, different change.  Good for you, man.  And no, man, I just wanted to tell that guy, you know what, I know for one thing, my 
[03:08:30]  wife used to torture me with, that you're going to lose, you're going to be the one  that's the short end of the stick, you're never going to see your kids, you're not going  to have the visitation with them, I'm going to have sole custody, and it's all bullshit.  The court systems don't want it that way anymore.  No, they don't, they don't, it's very, very hard.  Oh, really?  It's very hard to lose custody of your kids.  If you're a father, and you get divorced, and I'm talking straight out of my ass, but 
[03:09:00]  if you go to the court, or whatever, or, you know, when you get divorced, if you make a  case and say, I want this amount of time with my kids, they have to prove that there's  something tractably and, like, convicted, convictable wrong with you.  Some other evil shit.  It has to be like, you're a fucking chronic criminal, even if you have done some, even  if you have a criminal fucking history, they can't just take away your, they can't take 
[03:09:30]  away your, your, your rights to custody of your kids, because your wife is mad at you.  The courts, the courts want it this way now.  They give you 50% custody of your children, because they don't want any deadbeat fathers  out there.  And as far as that, that you're going to lose all your money to all that, and that is all  crap.  You know what, they have a, they have a system now, and, you know, like, like, when I was  married, I was lucky if I was getting $100 a week out of my pay.  You know what, I got divorced, I got a raise. 
[03:10:00]  I get half my paycheck now.  Well, that's exactly the thing, and you get control of it.  So, I mean, you were, you, unless there was something weird going on in your house, you're  paying your wife half of everything anyway, or more, like you're saying.  Any father that says, I got divorced and I, my wife took my kids away, is a liar.  He gave his kids up.  It means he didn't put the fight up, and he didn't, and he also didn't step up and become,  you got to change your life.  You have to change the way you're going to do your life.  You have to start, I mean, you have to rearrange your life so that you can take care of your 
[03:10:30]  kids by yourself.  But it is better for the kids, I think.  All right.  Didn't hang it in there.  Thanks, Jeff.  Hey, no problem.  Thank you, guys.  This is turning into a very special opening show.  Yeah, I know, man.  It's fucking serious.  Very special.  What else is going on out there in the world?  These guys always sound like that.  Huh?  Yeah.  I don't know what happened.  Got this wife.  She was a fucking cunt.  Fat cunt wife.  I love my kids.  They all sound like that.  They don't really sound like the most appealing people. 
[03:11:00]  My fat cunt wife, and I describe myself.  I look like Brad Pitt.  I went to Harvard.  I'm a fucking catch over here.  I'm the greatest guy ever.  Fat cunt.  You should see me.  I'm beautiful.  But see, it's a special.  I'm a genius.  And it's a special case, once again, because he tells a story.  He gets married on his wedding night.  He looked at the ceiling and had tears in his eyes.  He knew he made a mistake.  A lot of people don't feel like they're making a mistake from day one. 
[03:11:30]  Maybe a couple years in, you start going, holy shit, what the fuck is this about?  No, I think most people do.  You think most people realize?  Yeah.  A lot of people, I think, get married because they're trying to fix their relationship.  A lot of people get married to make their girlfriend happy.  They don't get married to begin.  It's like what you're saying about you're waiting for somebody to come and pick the real parents to pick up the kid.  And I remember when we were at the hospital and my wife was in labor, the whole time I thought, I realized that I was really thinking, we're going to go through this. 
[03:12:00]  She's going to go through labor and go through this thing that we've been training for and reading books about.  Yeah.  And then she's going to have a kid.  Then we're going to go home and get a pizza.  And I did not picture taking a kid home with us.  Like when we put the kid in the thing in the car, I was like, holy shit, this is our lives now.  That's so, and I think it's like that for some people really get married because they're like, my girlfriend's pissed off.  We'll have a wedding and then she'll feel better. 
[03:12:30]  And then you realize, oh my God, I'm fucking married now.  You had the wedding and now you're married.  Yeah.  I obviously take a lot of trips to Philly and usually we get up and go.  Let's pack your bag.  I pack my bag.  I'll call for the car and we're out of here, right?  Yeah.  That same little thing took about.  It's a lot harder.  At least two extra hours.  It's like doing the same thing you're used to doing, but completely numb your right arm and your left arm and then attempt to do that, what you're used to doing. 
[03:13:00]  That's how I felt.  You know what?  It's great though.  That's what, that part I liked that your life gets that much harder because you just get more, you get, you adapt and you get more competent.  Like I remember feeling like a Vietnam, like the guys in Nam who like have those big, they have big, heavy rifles.  The big packs on their back.  You've got like a gun belt down the right side and when you stand up, all this clanging armor and you're walking with all this shit and that's me at like, you know, taking my kids to the, to the, to Coney Island. 
[03:13:30]  I take them to Coney Island in the summer a lot and we just got, I've got all this shit.  I've got each kid's bag.  I've got my stuff.  I've got all that fucking crap.  And I'm like, let's move out.  And then we start moving a few clicks down the beach.  We get to a bad beach.  All right, we need to move.  I've got one crying.  So I got to pick her up.  The other one I got by the hand.  And then you just move and you become.  It just sounds like so much work.  Well, if you attack it like I'm, like I'm a, I'm a guy and I'm, you know what I mean? 
[03:14:00]  I've got muscles and I can make this work.  You're the Sarge.  Yeah.  And then it's positive.  If you look at it that way, it really is to me a point of like an attitude thing.  If you really are like waiting for mom to tell you, give you a list of shit to do and  you're just sort of like, yes, dear, then it's depressing.  But if you take it on, like, here's what we're doing.  And then you get good at that.  Getting the shit in the car.  It gets satisfying.  I'm amazed at how well I do shit now.  Yeah.  I always sucked at doing shit, but I could set up some shit. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah.  You'll get your plays and all that.  They're like, good.  They're like, you set that up really quick.  I'm like, oh yeah, you fucking did.  If you bring male skills to raising a kid, it's really satisfying.  Yeah.  I got male skills all of a sudden because before that I was useless.  I have to think about how quickly I can tear apart my AR-15, clean it, and put it back  together again.  There you go.  It's pretty much where I'm at with being good at stuff.  See, and here's this without the emotional attachment you do have. 
[03:15:00]  Exactly.  But I'll tell you something.  That's what makes it.  I'm just hearing logistics.  Yeah, you're just hearing logistics.  You're pretending to come into that fucking cunt for as long as you did.  I think you should be sainted for that.  I really do.  Believe me.  You should be sainted.  That took courage.  That was not wanting a kid.  I'm serious.  Not wanting a kid.  That's the thing that everybody doesn't do.  Most guys would just say, ah, fuck it.  Yeah, I'll just fuck her, have a kid, see how that goes.  No.  Oh, the most frightening thing to me would be to have a kid. 
[03:15:30]  You would have had a bad, that would have been bad for you.  Yeah, not good.  Not good.  No.  I like places like Atlantis.  Yeah.  And Vegas.  And I like just going there.  Yep.  Drop of a hat.  I like leaving and going there.  That was one of the coolest things when I got divorced was realizing I can just get on  a plane and go to another city and I don't even have to tell anybody.  I got a passport and an Amex.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[03:16:00]  I don't need a suitcase.  I don't need clothes on my back.  I'll buy shit when I get there.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Don't pack socks.  Just buy socks.  That's it.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Or packing in a hotel and just going, I'm going to leave half these clothes in this room.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Throw some stuff away.  Just get out of here.  Let me go to Dominic in the Poconos.  We love our phone calls from the Poconos.  The dommer.  Always the dommer.  What up, Dom?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm excited to talk to you guys.  I'm a little nervous. 
[03:16:30]  Sorry.  Well, we're not excited.  Calm down.  At all.  To be talking to you.  But go ahead, sir.  Yeah.  There's no reward or consequence in either however it goes.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  Very rewarding.  I'm actually calling because a friend of mine called.  He, about a month ago today, I think it was.  Um, he decided to get a divorce and his wife, it was in the news, uh, if you look in the  news, um, his wife shot and killed him.  Because he wanted a divorce? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, because, uh, I'm not sure what the specific fight was over, uh, but she shot him four times  and killed him, yeah.  Where was this?  Uh, in Butler, New Jersey.  What do you want us to do with that, Dominic?  I don't know.  I mean, he was a huge listener of you guys.  He loved, his name is, you know, he was Carl from Jersey. 
[03:17:30]  He called in, he had the deep voice.  And I wanted to see if I could plug his website, uh, because you're taking donations for his kids.  I'm guessing it's.  Wait, the guy used to listen to the show?  He loved you guys.  Ew.  Oh, man.  What the hell?  I hate losing a listener.  What was his best phone call on our show?  I don't remember.  Well, how about one time?  Um, never mind.  Well, actually, if you.  No, you're right, actually.  What am I trying to do?  If you listen to your, uh.  Trying to make something out of this shit.  Jesus.  You're absolutely right.  What?  Will you plug the dead guy's website? 
[03:18:00]  We gotta move on.  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  It's CarlMirasola.org.  It's M-I-R-A-S-O-L-A.  Even in death, he has a .org.  You would think he would be moved up to .com status.  Oh, well.  He's an organization.  He's an NPR.  Carl, there's a part of San Diego.  Died gunshot once in their bedroom.  911 call.  Yeah, well, well.  What happened?  What, she fucking get mad?  Yeah, she was fucking wacko. 
[03:18:30]  She was a real piece of shit.  As long as I know her, so fuck her.  But, uh, I mean.  I'll take your word for it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't want to fuck her.  13-year-old girl.  7-year-old twins.  She left kids behind?  They were in the house.  Yeah, I mean.  That's what they fucked up.  They were in the house.  They were in the house.  That's just wonderful.  Wait a minute.  Did she kill herself, too?  She killed herself?  No.  I don't think so.  Well, but she's not going to be around for the kids.  No, but she's, uh, she's wheelchair-bound, too.  What? 
[03:19:00]  Was she before?  She had multiple sclerosis.  Yeah.  How the fuck did she aim the gun?  The guy allowed someone in a wheelchair to kill him with a shotgun?  Was it a shotgun?  Did he just get behind her and push her out the door?  Yeah, right.  How did she keep the barrel straight?  MS, they're fucking waving that shit all over you.  He used to call all the time.  Travis remembers taking all his calls.  Travis?  Yeah, I totally remember this guy.  He had a deep voice, just like that caller said.  He would call at least three times a week.  Well, get it.  He never had any, like, special calls. 
[03:19:30]  He would just, like, hey, Carl from Jersey.  He would say what he had to say.  Get a Carl from Jersey call.  See if you can find one.  I usually, uh, mark them.  You're the dead guy.  See if anything was ominous.  I'm usually good with this.  I don't remember Carl from Jersey.  Have you heard a squeaky wheelchair wheel and a gun cocking?  In the background, that's a Carl call?  Jesus, man.  I would assume Carl would appreciate this.  Yeah, definitely.  Please, guys, somebody donate money because his kids really, really need it.  Why?  He's dead.  Oh, the kids.  The kids.  Who's handling the money to get to the kids? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Her?  Yeah.  The wife?  Right.  No, Carl's sister.  What?  Carl's sister?  Yeah, she's great.  She really is.  This is really...  And so is she caring for the kids?  Who's got the kids?  Uh, yeah, she's caring for the kids.  Oh, there it is, let's say.  In loving memory.  Ugh.  You only got one little picture of the poor guy up there.  Jesus.  A couple guys at my job set up.  Much of a tribute.  How do I donate fucking money?  Jesus.  You got me. 
[03:20:30]  How do I do this?  Get a PayPal.  PayPal.  PayPal?  I don't have a PayPal account.  He doesn't have a PayPal account.  I don't have a PayPal account.  You don't have a PayPal account.  I don't have a fucking...  You never put anything on eBay?  Then use your PayPal and give this fucking family money and I'll just give you the money.  I'm my pal.  I ain't paying him.  I ain't paying him.  I'm my pal.  All right.  So the website...  I'm sure some of the listeners will help you out here.  They're Carl's friend.  What's the website again?  It's easier if you go to carlskids.bbnow.org. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I'm trying to spell his last name.  All right.  It's carlskids.bbnow.org, as in the letters B.  1-877-CARLS-KIDS.  All right, Tommy.  Thanks for really bringing the show down.  Yeah, that was good.  This lady in a wheelchair shot her husband in front of the kids.  Yeah, really?  What do you want us to do with that?  That's the greatest thing I ever heard.  Yeah.  This lady in a wheelchair-bound lady with MS shot her fucking kid's dad in front of them. 
[03:21:30]  Nice.  Yeah, man.  It's going to turn out well.  Yeah, the PayPal shit will fix the kids right up, I'm sure.  Right then.  After seeing their father gunned down.  That's going to be a windfall.  Yeah.  A couple of wheeze, and they'll erase the memory of what they saw that day.  Just enough to get them a nice new shirt and some pants.  Fucking A.  And how about we get this poor guy a .com?  Org.  A .org?  Jesus.  I think you need that to raise money.  You need a .org for money raising? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, a .org and you raise some money.  That's organization, so it's like, it has to be a . . .  So it's legit?  Yeah, it's all legit.  Oh, really?  Not for profit, I guess?  Yeah, probably.  Not for profit.  So every .org website is legit?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Everything on the internet is.  Of course.  No scams going on.  Oh, you're still here to depress us, Dominic?  Oh, he's still there.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, sorry, but PayPal's actually taken 5% of everything, too.  Yeah, well, they don't give a shit about that fucking thing.  They're going to earn a living, too. 
[03:22:30]  I don't care.  It's not their kids.  It's a donation.  Come on.  They don't give a fuck.  5% seems, that seems okay.  I mean, if you said 25%, then you might have something.  It's not like they raised it.  It's not like they, oh, a woman in a wheelchair killed your kid's father?  All right, we're going to up the fucking percentage then.  Because we are asked, because we just like doing that.  Yeah, we really saw.  Because it's funny to us.  If she has MS, what do you think she really was shooting at that day?  Yeah, maybe there was a bat.  She was trying to kill herself.  There might have been a bat in the house.  Who knows? 
[03:23:00]  There might be a story behind this.  See, Dominic, we're trying to make some humor out of this.  She really gave us a tough task.  What kind of gun was it?  I have no idea.  It had to be a shotgun.  No way she could aim.  By the way, Dogshit Sniffer needs beer money, so he just set up a website, dogshitsniffer.org.  .org, I'll do it for him.  .org, yeah.  Oh, what?  Travis has a Carl from Jersey call.  All right, Dominic, hold on.  This is a creepy dead guy now we get to hear.  This is from almost four years ago.  And what, all right, does it need a setup or probably not? 
[03:23:30]  You put your feet on the desk or something.  The guy's dead.  All right, let's hear that.  It's the setup.  They're going to play lacrosse, right?  They're going to play lacrosse with your head afterwards.  Let's go to Carl in Jersey.  Carl, what's up?  Opie, you put your feet up on that desk at 9 o'clock.  You're my hero.  You're my hero.  And that fiesta with those dopey bozos, I love you.  I'm going to buy XM for everybody I meet for the next 15 minutes.  I swear to God.  All right, thank you, sir.  You're amazing.  Thank you, bro. 
[03:24:00]  I lost one of the guys that thinks I'm a hero?  Fuck.  Fuck.  Guy thought I was a hero.  He's dead.  That means I only have nine fans left.  God damn it.  Oh, well.  Wow.  I remember him now that I hear his voice.  I don't remember anybody.  I swear I remember that guy.  All right, well.  His kids need help.  Poor feller.  Thank you, guys.  What a bitch.  There has somebody come up to you and say, like, oh, I know somebody who's really good  friends with you in your past. 
[03:24:30]  You guys were really good pals.  Oh, who?  Mike Watson.  No idea who you're talking about.  I don't know.  He said you guys used to hang out all the time.  Yeah.  Mike Watson.  I don't know even the name Mike sounds weird to me right now.  And then you start feeling bad, like you don't want to get whoever it is.  Like, jeez, maybe I had a really good friend.  And so I start going, oh, yeah, Mike Watson.  Oh, yeah.  If I say the name rings a bell, it means I have no fucking clue.  Because I'll say that.  It's like, I don't remember, but the name rings a bell. 
[03:25:00]  No.  It does it.  The worst is when people come up to you and don't even say a friend.  They just go, you don't remember me, do you?  I'm like, you know something?  I had that happen, swear to God, Saturday.  I was at this party, and a high school friend was there, so he brought some of his friends,  I guess, to the party, and this guy, Rob, I'm leaving.  He goes, you don't remember me, do you?  I go, yeah, I remember you.  You fucking hated me in high school, never paid attention to me, but now because I have  some kind of, quote, fame, you feel like you have a connection to me. 
[03:25:30]  Yes, I do know who you are.  We were wrong, Rupert, but I'm like, we were wrong, Rupert, and you, you were right.  Right, right.  Exactly.  I'm like, of course I remember you.  You fucking hated me in school, thought I was a fucking nerd, and never paid any attention  to me in high school.  Yeah, I do remember you.  I don't remember when they say that.  They go, you don't remember me.  In this case, I did remember.  Now I just go, no, I don't.  Yeah, it's another, I'm the same way with the honesty now.  Yeah.  With people that I don't know. 
[03:26:00]  I'm like, no.  Do you remember me?  Nope.  No, I'm sorry.  Oh my God, I'm insulted.  That's, I'm sorry you feel that way, so.  You shouldn't have quizzed me like that.  No.  You should have said, hi, my name is, back in whatever, we fucking hung out at the, but  you quizzed me, and now you're paying for it.  I did a show last night in New Jersey, and this kid came up to me afterwards, and he  had a folder with him, and he said, I have to talk to you, okay?  And I'm like, oh.  What are these?  It's this dossier you have.  He goes, and I, this is weird, and I'm like, yeah, it is, and I'd like to stop it now by 
[03:26:30]  walking away.  And he goes, I want to be a writer, and I want your show to be good, so, and I go,  I don't have writers.  I just stop in there.  I don't have writers on my show.  I write it all myself.  And he goes, I don't believe that.  And I said, I do.  And he goes, you can't write a whole show by yourself.  So I just, now I'll start walking away.  He's like, yeah.  And he goes, just please read my material.  Just take it and read it.  And I go, I'm not going to read it, so I'm not going to take it from you and pretend and 
[03:27:00]  go throw it out 10 feet from here.  I'm not going to go through that.  So no.  Good luck to you.  And then have you sue me when a show comes up.  Yeah, exactly.  And then you just say, that was my idea.  Good luck, but no, I'm not going to read it.  And he goes, I don't understand why.  And I thought for a second I was going to struggle and try to explain it to him.  But then I said, it doesn't matter to me that you don't understand.  Oh, good for you.  You don't have to.  Why do I have to go, oh boy, I can't go home until this guy understands why I won't take  this packet.  I just don't want to waste my fucking time anymore. 
[03:27:30]  I'm going to leave you not understanding why I didn't take that.  Figure it out yourself.  I'm going to let you have that as a life experience that you just don't know why.  I'm an asshole.  The theme today is honesty from Louis C.K.  A lot of honesty comes from here.  It's just people.  It makes it easier, right?  I don't think that everybody owes them what they want to hear.  You're going to hear some things you don't want to hear sometimes.  I lost a guy.  He wanted to call, what was the guy's name that died?  Larry?  We forgot already. 
[03:28:00]  We forgot his fucking name.  It was Carl.  Jesus.  Wow.  We suck.  Who was that important guy?  Oh, God.  He probably hoped that.  He was hoping that.  His last dying moments were probably like, at least they'll reverently speak of me.  Yeah.  Somebody wanted to call him a deadbeat father because he wanted a divorce from his wheel-bound  fucking wife.  Yeah.  It doesn't sound so hot.  How much trouble could she have been?  Just lock up her wheels and go in the other room. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah.  Chalk them up.  Give her a flat tire.  You're on your way.  Walk away.  Josh in Maine.  Hitter, Josh.  Josh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just got divorced last Friday and you want to talk to Louie.  He's not going to care you got divorced.  Yeah, sorry, man.  I'm probably like the happiest man in the whole freaking United States.  Probably not.  See, what happened with me, I was one of these idiots that got married to the first girl  from high school. 
[03:29:00]  And all of a sudden one day you wake up next to this like 230-pound fucking sloth in bed  beside you and you realize, oh, my God.  Again, who is, what's so great about you?  What's so awesome about you?  Like, we're all just cut, we're all just six-pack bellied.  We're all such beautiful guys.  Everybody should want to be with us.  She got fat, really, and you're just awesome.  Full head of black hair and dark eyebrows and lantern jaw. 
[03:29:30]  The whole single eyebrow.  But I tell you what, man, frigging, I get a paycheck last Friday and I forgot what it  was like to have money.  It's like, I don't even know what to do with myself.  I took the week off from work to get all the divorce done and I'm like, I got money in  my pocket and I don't even know what the hell to do with myself now.  So you're happy.  All right, good luck with that.  Sounds good, man.  All right, guys.  You take it easy, I'm punching out.  All right, man. 
[03:30:00]  It says, it said, divorce last Friday, just wanted to shoot the shit with Lou.  You just want to shoot the shit.  Shoot the shit.  Doesn't know Louie well.  I guess we shot him.  You just want to shoot the shit with you, Lou.  That's great.  Two men.  Better than shooting Carl.  Enjoying their single lives.  That's the other thing I can't do is the bullshit talk.  How's it going?  Oh, pretty good.  It is hot out, huh?  Small talk.  Oh, fucking die.  Die from the heat, Hall. 
[03:30:30]  Everybody's got something interesting to say, though.  That's something I learned from when you do stand-up.  Before, I could afford to rent a car and just shut out all of society and just, you know.  Like, now I go rent a car.  Any city I'm in, even within three hours, I rent a car so I don't have to get driven  to the gig and picked up at the airport by some person.  But when I used to get picked up by some person who was asking me questions about whatever,  being on TV or whatever, it's so tedious.  But what I do now is I always ask them about their lives. 
[03:31:00]  Just whoever it is, you just go, where are you from?  You know, I'm in Winnipeg, Canada.  And I get picked up by some woman.  And I'm like, so what's your story?  Where are you from?  There's always something.  Don't you just not want to talk sometimes?  Well, they're so surprised because people love talking about themselves.  Sure.  Don't you just not want to talk though sometimes?  Well, then you just, you can shut them out.  Then they just run their mouth and you just have your own thoughts.  But occasionally they'll be like, oh, well, I live, I'm married.  My husband has no legs.  What? 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  All right.  We can go run with that.  Yeah, something to talk about that.  Your husband can't, but we can.  That's, like, sometimes I just don't want to fucking talk.  And I don't even want to, I don't even want to acknowledge by going like, yeah, yeah, yeah,  I know.  That's more painful.  I get it.  Yeah, yeah.  Because then I'm gritting my teeth thinking, shut the fuck up.  I don't want to have to make believe I'm acknowledging you.  No.  That's tedious.  And when you have kids, people want to have those conversations with your kids. 
[03:32:00]  They walk up to your kid, hi, what are you doing?  It's like, she doesn't know you.  Get the fuck away from her.  You can't punch someone in the balls.  Punch her in the pussy.  You're that high.  Wait a minute.  What?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to hang out with people that I don't want to because of the kid thing,  right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, yeah.  That ain't going to be good.  Yeah.  Other people.  I don't care if my kid gets along with other kids that he thinks is cool or whatever.  No, but you've got to talk to the dad while they're hanging out with him.  How's that?  That's awful.  It is, right?  Yeah, it's awful.  No, because this conversation we're having, I've been able to avoid people I don't want 
[03:32:30]  to be with or talk to.  That's what your Blackberry is for.  Do you have a Blackberry?  Oh, yeah, I do.  You've got to have it with you at all the times.  And you just stare into it while your kid's playing with another kid.  So I'm going to have assholes in my life that I'm going to have to deal with.  You have to become an unapproachable asshole.  So just always be on the Blackberry stuff.  Just always be on the Blackberry.  Don't talk to nobody.  So when they come to get their kid, what do I do?  When they come to get the kid?  Yeah.  This is down the road, I understand, but might as well get prepared now.  No, you know what?  I always trade taking care of somebody's kid for talking to them. 
[03:33:00]  Like if my kid has a play date, if my kid has a friend they want to have, I'll have  them over, the kid over, and I'll tell the parent, you go.  I'll take care of your kid.  You go have a day off.  What do you mean?  Well, that was in one of the episodes.  Yeah, I do it all the time.  I'll have two kids over.  Wait, the parents come over with the kid and hang out the whole time?  No, the parents go fuck off.  No, but I mean...  But you have to take care of another person's kid now.  Yeah, I have no problem with that.  But so what?  Yeah, I'll easily do that.  I should love nephews and nieces.  But I mean, there are times where the parent stays. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, sure, that happens, yeah.  Yeah, that ain't happening.  I ain't talking to no fucking asshole because he's in the same class as my kid.  You're going to have to get to know those people.  You know, you do make friends that way.  I could use a few friends, so that's fine.  Yeah, you'll like some of the people that you meet, and then there's other people you  won't like, and you and the other parents that you do like will shit on them.  It just never ends.  It becomes like a whole other thing.  Just the gossip never fucking ends. 
[03:34:00]  No, it gets really vicious, too.  Really?  Yeah, there's people that are really mean to other people's, other kids' parents, and  it gets really gross.  Really mean.  Fuck, I just had a realization.  I'm going to have to deal with people that I've avoided for many, many, many years.  Yes, Anthony, she's hot.  Have you tried that one yet?  No.  Is she an intern?  Yeah.  She's a Ron and Fez intern?  Got it.  Might as well stick around for Ron and Fez.  What's her name?  I think it starts with an S.  Thanks.  She's a Sam.  I mean, I was a Sam. 
[03:34:30]  No, it's not Sam.  I would remember that name.  She's got a little bit of a pear shape going.  No, it's good.  A little bit of a pear shape.  Come on.  That would look like naked.  Her hair is a little blow-dried.  God, you guys are picky.  Wow.  I'm not saying I wouldn't fuck her.  I fucked a lot worse.  I fucked some really disgusting people.  Oh, shit.  Fucking Louie, man.  It was great seeing you, buddy.  Same here, man.  Louie C.K., his new show is called Louie. 
[03:35:00]  It premieres next Tuesday.  We haven't talked about the show in the last hour, but I'm telling you, I saw the first  four episodes.  A lot of people in Philly, all loving it.  It starts next Tuesday at 11 o'clock, right after Rescue Me on FX.  Please check it out and decide for yourself.  At least take a peek.  I think you're going to like it, though, man.  A lot of our audience definitely will.  Definitely will.  I think they'll like it.  Oh, hell yeah.  I think the Opie and Anthony listening people will like it.  And it says right here, the show revolves around Louie's hectic life as a successful stand-up  comedian.  And newly single father, raising his two daughters. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah.  Whatever.  Some good stuff.  Great language.  You get to see Louie's ass.  That's what I'm asking there once.  Were you, the doctor's episode, which is going to do very well with Ricky Gervais, when he's  staring at your cock and just beating the shit out of you, and then brings the lady in?  Were you standing there completely nude, or did you have some...  I had some...  Did you have a sock on or something?  Well, it's so...  The person who we had doing wardrobe then, she had a triangle of felt like you use for 
[03:36:00]  women.  Right.  So she had...  We had to kind of call together like two or three of those, and she fucking glued them  all over my dick.  It was a nightmare.  She didn't have a sock.  That's what you're supposed to have, put a sock on your dick.  But when you would be...  But no, I was covered up.  He couldn't...  I mean, I was probably not fun to look at.  But my point...  With what was showing.  Doing the funnel nudity thing, you would definitely do in front of Ricky Gervais.  You wouldn't give a shit, right?  Well, I wouldn't show him my cock, but...  Oh, you wouldn't?  Just for the goof?  I wouldn't want to show him my cock.  Well, you showed your cock on Lucky Louie. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, I kind of ran through a room with my dick out, yeah.  But I wouldn't want to stand there with my cock out in front of a man, no.  That is a little much.  People that do that kind of thing are fucking gross to me.  No, yeah.  People that take out their dick and rub it on their friend.  It's like, you're fucking being gay.  That really is the weirdest thing.  Like, the party pictures where you're teabagging your sleeping friend.  Yeah, that's your fucking gay.  It's like, why would you think that because he's asleep, you should put your balls in  his mouth?  No. 
[03:37:00]  If he was awake, would you do that?  I was on a shuttle to Boston years ago, and Jay Moore happened to be on the plane.  He was in his 20s then.  Like, early 20s.  He started pretty young.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting next to him on the plane because we knew each other, and he's sitting  there in shorts, and he looks down at his crotch, and he goes, if I take out my cock, will you  spit on it?  Like, he just said that to be gross or whatever.  And I just decided in that moment, I don't like this guy.  I don't like him.  And I haven't... 
[03:37:30]  And I know Jay, you know, and we're kind of friends, but I still go back to that moment.  I'm like, that was fucking disgusting, and fuck him.  Fucking fake faggot.  I just...  It makes me sick.  You know what?  I think we've all seen...  That's still Jay to me.  I can't help it.  And I have affection for him.  He's a nice guy.  We've all seen Jay's cock way too many times.  Jay is one of those guys who likes to take his dick out.  Yeah.  Keep your fucking penis hidden.  He'll pull it right out.  Birthday parties?  I'm not going to fucking birthday parties.  You've got to do all that shit. 
[03:38:00]  Birthday parties, Lou.  What?  Birthday parties with the kids?  Yeah.  You've got to do all that.  What do you do there?  You know what?  When you get shut in in the house with the babies for long enough, you actually start appreciating  that stuff.  Putting your kids in the middle with all the other kids?  Right.  And then you'd hang out with the parents.  Well, when you were growing up...  There's always one.  You walk around the house, the birthday party looking tense.  Right.  And there'll be one guy who probably you wouldn't have talked to in real life otherwise.  But you're like, ah, he's here.  A guy that...  I love talking to him.  Or a woman that's kind of haggard looking, but her tits are interesting. 
[03:38:30]  And she's got a sense of humor.  So you'll like talking to her.  You'll start to see people that you like.  I kind of like her.  Something about her.  She's fun.  She's fun to talk to.  But I know this is an easy bit, but when we were growing up, we had none of this shit.  Yeah, you just went outside the door.  Right.  The parents didn't show up at the parties and hang out while the kids were hanging out.  That is why it's harder for us.  There was a major separation.  Yeah.  Like you said, yeah, you open the door and there was a whole life out there.  My mom, I was raised by a working mom.  And in the morning, we would all get ready and she'd go to work and we'd go to school. 
[03:39:00]  I, since I was in second grade, I would walk to school by myself.  She would just be like, I'll see you when I get home after dinner.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I'd go to school and then after school, it was up to me to figure out what to do with  myself.  And she just assumed you were all right.  Yeah.  And then I, and then she'd come home from work and she'd be like, oh, I got kids.  My kids are still around.  That's how shit happened.  That's the way it was like every day for year for my whole childhood.  And that's why a lot of kids got touched. 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, no, it is.  There was a fucking child molester in my neighborhood.  Just waiting for mommy to go to work.  Yeah.  There was a guy named Jean Baptiste who used to drive around in a Pinto and every kid I  knew except for me, and I used to honestly feel a little unattractive that he never hit  on me.  You want at least to be hit on.  He'd take you to, when you hit around teenage years, Jean Baptiste would take you to lunch  and then he'd put his hand on your leg and every kid had a different toleration point  of how long he let him put him on his, put on his hand on his leg. 
[03:40:00]  You should have said, if I pull my cock out, will you spit on it?  Yeah, exactly.  It might have turned him off.  Exactly.  Now the kids just don't.  But now you're responsible for every moment of their lives.  Now you got to take them through everything.  Remember your mom, I mean, would just drop you off and then go, all right, call me when  you need a ride.  Yeah.  That's how we all grew up, right?  That's the way it was.  But now, no, I have kids over my house or I take my kid to their house.  And I can't imagine a day where my daughter just walks, just leaves the house unattended.  I can't imagine it. 
[03:40:30]  I don't know how to process that.  That's going to fuck you up.  Yeah.  I remember taking those bike rides with your friends.  It was fucking like three, four towns over like it was nothing.  Every so often you'd be like, let's take a real long fucking bike ride.  And you'd go like, yeah, a couple of towns over instead of your normal, just riding your  bike around the block shit.  You'd go to the woods and find a dead cat or something.  Yeah, poke it with a stick for a while.  Some retarded girl who shows her bush to people or whatever.  That's the way it was.  I was growing up back then when the parents left you alone. 
[03:41:00]  Why does everyone know a retarded girl that used to show her bush?  You know how many times that has come up on this show?  We love doing that, I guess.  I don't know.  No, it's the way it was.  Now people want to talk about kid parties.  They want to warn me about Little League and all this other shit.  Look, man, I'm only six weeks in.  That's a while.  I'm good for now.  Louie, thank you, brother.  Sure, man.  Louie C.K. on Twitter, too, man.  He's a good one to follow.  You didn't like that shit at first, I remember.  Now you're all in.  I still am not crazy about it.  I still don't like, I regret, every time I tweet, then I go, I shouldn't have said that. 
[03:41:30]  And 100,000 people read it.  That's just something about that that's weird to me.  It's dangerous.  I'll take some of your 100,000 if you're not liking them.  That's weird.  Squeeze them over to my side.  I'll take them.  I'll take those fuckers.  People get mad at me because I don't follow anybody.  It's hilarious you don't.  No, I follow zero people.  Why would I follow somebody?  What would I get out of that?  I read what they tweet?  I don't give a shit.  It's hilarious that you don't.  You have 100,000 followers and then it says following? 
[03:42:00]  A big, bad fucking zero.  That is good.  You know how much of an asshole you got to be to have that?  One would ruin that.  If it even said one, it would ruin it.  Well, Conan has one.  I'm not going to say zero is hysterical.  Your buddy, Conan, has one.  Has one that he follows.  As a goofy, he follows one.  I thought about following Sarah Palin.  I was thinking maybe just her.  You got to stay with the big, fat donut.  You got something there, right?  Yes, of course.  Tonight, Red Eye.  Oh, right, right, right.  Fox News Channel.  Jimmy is going to be hosting. 
[03:42:30]  Jimmy Norton is hosting and I will be a guest on there.  Let Jimmy do the plug.  With Jimmy.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Jimmy's head.  He doesn't want to do the plug.  What are you doing?  Why are you being so quiet?  He doesn't want to do it.  He's got laryngitis today.  No, he doesn't.  He's going to be great on Red Eye.  And he's hosting, which should be very funny.  You got me and him and some blonde chick with real long legs.  And Coulter.  Is a Republican.  Yes, and Coulter. 
[03:43:00]  So you and Jimmy doing Red Eye and I'll make a video that 5,000 people will see.  No, that's great.  My career is going great.  Videos are fun.  And of course, what is this?  July 2nd and 3rd, Atlantic City, the Borgata Hotel Casino.  Jimmy Norton will be there.  And go to theborgata.com for tickets.  Why didn't he do his own plug?  Because those are the two things that I'm going to be at, too.  Ah.  Make it by yourself. 
[03:43:30]  Exactly.  All right.  Louis C.K., thanks.  We leave you with this.  Derek put together a little Bob Kelly rap thing.  When Bob Kelly was freestyling in here.  You might remember that from last week.  I wanted to smack him in the head.  Derek did something with that audio.  All right.  Ready?  I'm hanging on the show with my friend Ant and Greg.  We all of a sudden start to eat eggs.  We put them down and talk into the mic.  Because you know we don't like to fuck the diet. 
[03:44:00]  We like pussy.  And it's got to be Jim Say.  Don't laugh at me, Anthony, while I'm on the mic.  You might not know how to fuck a diet.  I'll say it twice.  You don't give a shit.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  Fuck you.  You know when that dog you had is a fucking mutt.  Opie had the right moves because the steak was on the floor.  And his potatoes weren't there no more.  So he killed that motherfucker, rough, rough, rough. 
[03:44:30]  But you know what?  It wasn't that guff.  Look it up in the dictionary if you don't know what I mean.  Because I don't have time to show you the team of the A's.  The Rampage Jackson.  You know I'm a fraction.  Of what I should have been a long time ago.  But I'll keep rapping.  You don't hate this.  You don't even know.  I'll throw it in right in the middle.  I'm so fucking, wow.  I eat Skittles.  Oh, yeah.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow. 
[03:45:00]  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude.  I'm not done.  Fuck that.  I'll make it jack.  And then I'll look back on the guy with the heart attack that saw Sasquatch in the woods.  All of a sudden, he has the word coulds in his fucking mouth.  Because he had a gun made of a stick.  All of a sudden, you had to pit.  Did you know him?  Did you know her?  Or did you like it?  White girls like me.  Black girls like me.  Girls adore me.  Even the ones that even saw me know.  I ain't rhyming with a fucking show.  Why?  I don't know.  I'll steal a fucking rap from a hoe. 
[03:45:30]  I don't give a shit.  I'll move on.  Push another button.  I'll flow with it.  You don't even got no fucking show without it.  Yo, I'm Bob Kelly.  I'm a rapping genius.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has hair that makes you go, he.  Opie has a smile that makes you go, wow.  Anthony has a cock that makes me go, dude. </pre>
