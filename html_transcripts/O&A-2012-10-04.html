<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie absent due to a medical issue: a rare anal condition requiring daily treatment to prevent his anus from sealing shut.  Anthony and Jim Norton ("Edgar") filled in, launching into a discussion of Opie’s predicament.  The conversation then veered into the complexities of fatherhood, sparked by gay staff member Travis recounting his unexpected pregnancy and the subsequent emergency C-section resulting from the umbilical cord being wrapped around the baby's neck.  This segued into a broader discussion of parental anxieties, with Anthony sharing deeply personal anecdotes about his own childhood. He described himself as an overly sensitive child prone to dramatic crying fits at school, often stemming from imagined romantic rejections or perceived social slights.  He detailed his childhood insecurities and social awkwardness, recounting humorous yet cringeworthy stories about his romantic mishaps and naivete, including one instance where he publicly rejected a girl who liked him due to peer pressure and another involving holding up a racist sign at school under duress.  The segment concluded with further explorations of Anthony’s childhood, focusing on his questionable hygiene habits and his often difficult social interactions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Meh. Enough palavers, eh?  Meh. Hi, everybody.  Hi.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, and 50% of Opie and Anthony are here.  And then, of course, we have Jim Norton, or Edgar, who he's been since he came in here.  I never know who's going to show up.  It's quite exciting every day, not knowing who's going to be here. 
[00:00:30]  Edgar.  With his pursed lips and his hard fingernails.  I like how Bobby Kelly said they're like baby fingernails.  And they touch you.  Enough.  Hope he's out.  Well, a lot of people speculating about a child.  Things like that. I don't know what's going on.  Any news?  I've heard nothing.  No.  I think what Opie said, it was a medical thing with Opie himself, not baby's. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, oh.  What is it?  What is it this time?  It's a weird condition where the skin of your anus begins to seal itself shut.  Oh, no.  And you have to have that.  You have to go to the hospital.  They have to keep it open so you can still evacuate.  Wow.  Making it literally impossible to shit.  Yeah.  It needs constant attention to keep it open?  Yes.  It comes from almost like a vampire-like ability to heal oneself.  And the body interprets the anus as an injury.  As a wound.  As an open wound.  Yes.  So he's in the doctors right now. 
[00:01:30]  What they do is they just take a razor and they just run a straight razor down the anus.  How often do they have to do that?  Once a day for the rest of your life.  Oh, God.  That sucks.  Yes.  So you have to use vinegar wipes.  And you're finished.  Ow.  No, I've heard nothing.  I don't know if they had doctor stuff to do today for his wife.  I don't know.  I'm assuming.  Having a fucking kid, like, it just seems to me, from what I've heard, to be just a traumatic experience for everyone involved. 
[00:02:00]  It's just like this major medical thing that people have to go through.  Ah.  And just the worry that you get.  Travis, our own Travis, although completely gay.  Homosexual.  Yes.  In a very flaming homosexual way.  Accidentally got a gal for you.  Yes.  He was aiming his cock for a man's asshole.  That's right.  And it kind of deflected.  Yeah.  And he wound up impregnating a woman. 
[00:02:30]  Yes, yes.  Now, I'm just, were you worried for the safety of your loved ones?  Well, yeah, but we had, my wife was induced.  Oh.  She induced me.  And at one point, we had a special situation.  Like, the, the umbilical cord of my daughter got wrapped around her, her, uh.  Oh, man.  Her, her neck.  So they had to, like.  We always hear about that one in the movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they had to, like, rush her into surgery and, like, you know, take the baby out. 
[00:03:00]  So I was, yeah, a little worried when, you know.  It's, like, things like that.  And then in hindsight, it's just like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, that, but at the time, it's got to just be this, to, to, to the doctors, it's no big  deal.  It's like, okay, well, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're losing, uh, we're, we're losing  its heartbeat, so we're just going to run you into surgery right now.  We're losing.  And take the baby.  Wow.  And take the baby.  So, you know, drink this and, and here we go.  And, and the next thing you know, like, the room's empty and I'm just sitting there. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  You're like, hey, what about me?  And they don't panic about it, right?  No, no, not at all.  No, it's, it's, you know, our doctor and then, like, five nurses and they're like, see you later.  And two minutes later, somebody comes out saying, oh, yeah, no big deal.  Baby's here.  You want to go see?  Jeez.  That's all it takes?  It's just a couple of minutes?  It's literally five minutes.  But for those five minutes, you're panicking.  Worst five minutes of my life.  Yeah.  See?  Yeah.  How do they induce labor?  Uh, they just.  Paging Doc Martin.  Yeah.  Paging Doc Martin. 
[00:04:00]  Like a toothpaste tube.  It's been so long.  I don't even remember.  I think it's just.  Is it a beverage or a needle?  It's just drugs.  No, the, the needle is, you can get like, uh, you know,  an epidural, like to, to calm the pain or whatever.  Yeah.  But, uh.  Oh, God.  Just, it just sounds like a, a very traumatic, very, um, worrisome thing.  Yeah.  And induction isn't like a, a, a 10 minute thing.  It's like you, you get induced and it could be, you know, two hours, 10 hours.  Yeah, but it's still going to be in labor for fucking hours. 
[00:04:30]  It just kind of gets the process going.  How long was she in labor for?  Uh, well, she was, I mean, like labor, labor.  Yeah.  She was never in labor because they were just like kind of waiting.  So when they go in and say, look, we got to go get the baby now because of the cord,  what do they do?  Do they, do they, what do they, like, how do they stop the cord from strangling the  kids?  They just, they just perform the C-section early.  Oh, a C-section.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  They open up and they go, hey, let's get this out from around there.  Yeah.  Let's cut fat.  Like her, her water never, never broke. 
[00:05:00]  And when it did, the baby slid and the, and the cord got, oh, Jesus.  Got wrapped.  Oh, is that what happens?  Oh, I got the heebie-jeebies.  But how, how, how long does that happen?  Like, how long is that happening before they, like, how long was the baby being choked like  that?  Oh, like a minute.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Like, because they're constantly monitoring everything.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they have it down to a fucking, what a, what a, what a, what a bad design, though.  That seems to happen a lot.  Yeah.  Like that whole thing. 
[00:05:30]  And back in what I like to refer to as the day, uh, what did they do?  They just, the kid, the kid probably died.  Kid was dead.  Probably.  I mean, they had no way of knowing.  Child mortality rate was insane back, uh, in the said day.  Well, nature.  Well, nature.  There's a lot of slack on that cord.  Totally, right?  Tighten it up a little bit.  Yeah.  It's giving you a noose, nature.  Oh, God.  Nature's dumb.  Yeah.  Not as much slack, you bastard.  We don't need that much.  Wow.  Yeah, that was the worst.  Oof.  All right.  Well, uh, you know, it's still awaiting news, I guess. 
[00:06:00]  We've heard nothing.  I would imagine the process, like, the most frustrating part is that you've been not being  pregnant for nine months, but, like, the last two weeks, when it's, like, any day.  Yeah.  Any day.  Is it today?  Is it now?  Oh, that's just got to be insane.  Because you've got, like, a fully developed person in your stomach.  Oh, stomach.  Listen, you child.  In your belly.  Let's just say it tum-tum.  In your tum-tum.  Yeah.  In your nummy-num.  Yeah.  In mommy's tummy.  Mommy's tummy.  Yes.  The stork put a full baby in mommy's tummy. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Through the vag.  Yeah.  He opened her legs and just dropped the baby in, and then gave it a little heedle, heedle,  heedle for good luck.  She ate a watermelon seed, and it grew inside her after a big black man.  Yeah.  Are you and Jess trying?  No.  No.  No, we're not a...  What about that big, without condom sex thing you guys have been working on?  Well, that's happening, but there's, I mean...  Oh, boy.  She's on the pill.  Oh, okay.  And, you know, you pull out. 
[00:07:00]  Oh.  So...  Even with the pill you pull out?  Yeah.  Jeez.  Double check.  How overcautious.  Oh, wow.  Well, I can't...  It's an economic thing is mainly the reason that we're not trying at the moment.  Oh, okay.  But you do want to have one.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's a prevention.  Worth a pound of jizz.  That's right.  Oh, so in time, I guess you want a little Sam Roberts, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, who wouldn't?  To continue the Roberts dynasty.  Exactly.  That was going on, right?  Oh, I hope the kid is just fucking nothing like you.  Like, you can't mold him to, like, wrestling. 
[00:07:30]  He's like, oh, Dad, it's too violent.  Oh, what are you saying, Jimmy?  I don't like this.  He's not even, like, the masculine version of me.  He's even gayer than I am.  Oh, my God.  Well, no, he's just, like, from the time, his first words were,  Mama's shoes.  He puts them on and walks around in them.  Oh, it's tragic when the doctors came in and told you that the umbilical cord was folded in half and shoved up his ass.  They spanked him, and he came on his own little leg. 
[00:08:00]  We've never seen this happen before.  Oh, wow.  Yes, he shot a wad.  It's unheard of.  But it does seem like a very, because you're constantly worried something can go wrong.  It's like docking the space shuttle.  It's like those moments before you actually know, are we going to have an unmitigated disaster, or is this success for the entire universe?  And then there's a...  And then when the kid comes out, he can run around smashing his head on stuff.  And he just gets up.  He just gets up.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You've got to make sure everything's fucking, like, padded. 
[00:08:30]  No corners on anything.  Everything you own, it's got to look like something out of, like, a Dr. Seuss book.  All these rounded corners and soft things.  Do you have that?  Like, all the kitchen drawers and stuff have the clips?  Not anymore.  You probably did, though, originally, right?  Leave the poised on the bottom.  That's the only that kid will learn.  How old is your daughter?  She's two?  She's three and a half.  Oh, wow.  Little Riley.  Yeah.  She's very cute.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She likes everyone.  She's a little shy, though, right? 
[00:09:00]  Well, when you're Uncle Pauling, yeah.  When I'm Uncle Pauling, I never say creepy things.  I always just go, hi.  I know.  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  She was far less shy last week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's weird to come in and this is all these big people.  Oh.  It would be, like, scary, I think, as a kid.  As a kid.  She loves Anthony.  I know.  She's hilarious.  She's crazy.  He flirts.  No.  She actually loves her.  Yeah.  You don't want to hear that.  Mama, compound.  No.  No. 
[00:09:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  She loves the house.  Yeah.  But she likes you.  Well, because I'm the guy at the house.  Exactly.  She likes the pool and stuff.  But she asks if you're going to be there.  Aw.  It's adorable.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then, yeah, it's like you're raising a kid and then you've got to worry if you're  fucking that up.  It just seems like a commitment that takes a long-ass time.  When did you think Riley was, like, starting to become a person?  Two.  Oh, not till two?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then they actually start to, like, you know, talk and form sentences and remember 
[00:10:00]  things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you realize my mother was still worrying about me well into my 30s?  I'm not even shitting you.  I'm, like, thinking, like, all right, when can you kind of, you know, back off and be  like, all right, you know, I don't have to worry about my kids anymore.  No.  Like, she was still worried, like, if I was...  I don't think that stops, though.  You know, like, my dad's still, like, when we'll, like, you know, drive to Montreal to  see my wife's family, he'll be like, all right, well, you know, text me when you get 
[00:10:30]  there.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't think that goes away, though.  Well, that's kind of like any loved one worry.  So I understand that part of it.  But I mean, the parent-child...  You had a higher worry?  ...worry thing, yeah.  Like, it starts with the cord around the fucking neck and shit like that, and then it just continues.  You're going to bash your head on something sharp, you're going to drink some poison,  you're going to get kidnapped.  It's just a fucking worrisome, horrible thing.  You just don't want to care about anyone.  No, bingo. 
[00:11:00]  I don't want to care that much about anything.  Not even anyone, anything in my life.  You remember, I was actively worried about you into your 30s?  Yeah, like, worried if I was going to just even have a roof over my head and, you know,  God, was I a fucker.  Slipping you $20 bills.  Like, just save this.  What are you doing?  Use it for gas.  She probably should have been worried, though.  The fact that you were fucking power drinking at noon and driving an air conditioning van  fucking 90 back to work to fucking put a toilet on someone's ceiling. 
[00:11:30]  Of course she was worried.  I worry about you now.  I'm your radio partner.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess I gave reason to worry over the years.  Was she worried about Joe, too, and Dawn?  No, Joe's more of an independent guy.  Dawn, of course.  She's like, my baby.  Dawn, the girl.  But I was just that fucking oversensitive crybaby kid, so she had to worry about me.  I was like, oh, she's probably looking at me during my entire youth just going, oh, he's 
[00:12:00]  going to be just a disaster.  Just a weepy faggot.  She'd call you into, like, your 30s asking if anybody, like, was mean to you today?  Was anyone mean?  I'd be like, Mom, I cried at work today.  I would announce that I cried at school.  Like, I'd get home and be like, hear you, hear you, I cried at school today.  Because it wasn't enough attention that you got at school when you were crying.  You needed some more.  Somebody was a blogger before it was hip. 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Aunt would have had an emotional live journal if you got to school later.  I was emo before emo.  Oh, you're the Britney, leave Britney alone.  Yeah.  So what happened?  You cried at school?  Why?  I don't know.  There was always something, you know, my feelings got hurt.  They picked on you?  Things like that.  They picked on me.  I've told this story about the cookies I brought in that my mom bought, and they said it looked  like dog shit, and I started crying because I felt bad that the cookies were, and my mom 
[00:13:00]  bought them.  You had duty cookies.  Your mom didn't even make them?  She bought them?  She bought them, yeah.  Who cares?  I know, but...  You're making fun of the manufacturer.  Look, Sam, why don't you just...  Nobody wants duty cookies made fun of.  Oh.  Duty cookie kumia?  Oh.  Duty cookie.  Oh.  Kaka kumia.  Kaka kumia.  I cried at work today.  Travis, yeah.  I know.  He made fun of duty cookies.  I was fucking...  I was the little fez. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, it was very harrowing.  What a harrowing youth I had.  So you'd just go home and just say, I cried today?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I'd go home, and I actually would wait until it was pried out of me, like mom would  be like, you know, oh, how was school today?  Oh, well, let me tell you.  A little weeping going on.  A little crybaby Anthony had to cry.  Why?  Oh, shit cookies. 
[00:14:00]  Because of your crap cookies that you bought and put me in a bad spot.  And then I'd cry because, like, Valentine's Day, the girl I wanted to get a valentine  from didn't give me one.  Oh, what was her name?  Ah, fucking cunt.  But she would, like, because I would always get these fantasies built up in my head that  I would go to school, and the girl I was totally in love with would give me the big  valentine, and we'd talk and hold hands and all that shit. 
[00:14:30]  And, of course, she gives it to the popular guy, guy, you know?  And I'm, like, left there.  Because you had built up the whole scenario in your head.  Oh, did I build it up?  And now that it wasn't happening, it's like, well, this whole thing is falling apart.  And it felt so good in your head.  Yeah.  Did you give her a valentine?  No.  Why would I do anything like that and actually be proactive in my life?  You just hoping she'd give you one?  Right, right.  Who, the fucking kid with the fur coat and the giant cock?  And the weepy eyes? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Fucking pissy eyes and leaky dick.  The creative kid with the dolls back there and the voices.  It was a puppet.  Yeah.  Wasn't it a doll?  It was a puppet.  That's who the girl's going to want.  I don't want the football player.  I want the kid doing the Carol O'Connor impression.  The fucking...  Playing with the doll without strings.  With a puppet without strings.  A peat.  Yeah.  She fantasized that she'd bring it to you.  Yeah, yeah, that she would bring it to me.  And I used to just fantasize about romance as a kid. 
[00:15:30]  What a fucking fruit.  You really did lock away everything in your childhood at one point.  At some point.  The door shut.  Yeah.  The vault fucking handle spun.  And that fucking combination was lost.  Yeah.  Never to open again.  No.  Did you just cry in the classroom?  Uh, yeah, sometimes.  Openly just crying in the classroom.  Sometimes I would.  What a loser.  In front of the teacher. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Who I...  Then would want to, you know, give me sympathy.  Of course.  Did the teacher ever stop class to ask why you were crying, or...  Uh...  Like, did you have to make it about you?  I'm trying to think.  I did have to make it about me.  I was, uh...  Yeah, I was craving detention.  Did you explain to the teacher that this was how you got love at home, when there was  fighting, you would cry, and that's when the hugs came.  Why would I explain something?  I had no clue, really, what it meant.  I thought maybe you analyzed that with her.  I never analyzed anything.  I just... 
[00:16:30]  It just happened, like...  Like, yeah, parents fighting, of course.  I'm gonna just...  I have a stomachache.  We had a crying kid in class, and the teacher hated him.  Oh, jeez.  She hated how he would just cry at me.  Yeah, definitely.  No, I think they liked me.  Because he would sit there crying, because he couldn't figure out the math, because he  was sick the day before, and then he'd come in, and we'd learn a new lesson, and she gave  him the work from the day before, but he didn't know the lesson, so he would just stare at 
[00:17:00]  the page, and he'd start crying, and then the teacher would kick him out of the classroom  and make him go into the empty room next door to do his work, because he was disturbing  the class.  He was just a distraction.  Yeah, and while we were all learning, we just heard from next door,  Oh, yuck.  So he wasn't like a quiet sober.  No.  He was bawling.  Whoa.  I hate him already.  He figured out his math work.  He was really, like, yelly crying.  He was sobbing, crying.  I was a yell, cry-y guy.  I was trying to, you know, work out the...  Just like sniffling and... 
[00:17:30]  The sniffling, um, because it was, like, it was really forcing.  Yeah.  Forcing it out to, you know, get some kind of attention.  You were like Caligula making the speech when Tiberius died.  You had to put onion by your eye to get a little fucking...  Two onion bags.  To get a little tears coming.  Whether it was an onion or just smelled like onions.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It's just...  Oh, poor Weepy Anthony.  It is very, um...  You were crying on purpose.  I must have been, like, at the time, I never put two and two together like that. 
[00:18:00]  But where is the Valentine's boy?  You're right.  Not only the crier, but the Valentine's, the romantic, the sweet duty cookie boy.  Where is that?  I would just imagine, uh, like, holding hands to me was, uh, like, the big thing.  Yeah.  That was a big fucking deal as a little kid.  I'm not talking fucking, you know, 15.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm holding hands.  This is great.  And I'm talking, you know, when you're, eh, you know what, like, seven, eight, nine. 
[00:18:30]  At that age, hand-holding is the equivalent of cream pie cleaning as an adult.  It's very, uh, important, that holding hand thing.  And, um, you know, there was very few circumstances that I actually got to hold a girl's hand.  There was, um, a fire drill.  Because you're crying all the time.  Yeah, exactly.  I was crying.  I was wiping my tears away.  So, um, I was crying a lot.  Yeah.  Uh, no, fire drills, you used to have to hold the girl's hand and walk out and double file 
[00:19:00]  kind of a thing.  Uh, and then there was square dancing, which we had in gym class.  Like, I grew up in fucking Oklahoma.  I was on Long Island.  I had square dancing, too.  What?  Did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were in Jersey?  No, Florida.  Oh.  Yeah.  You and Eric?  Did you see you?  Oh, yeah.  Take the boat to the square dancing.  Eric's just square dancing and cracking the hardwood floor.  Yeah, you see him riding his boat with a fucking corncob pipe and a fucking square dancer's  hat.  Pretty cool, huh? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, pretty cool.  So we can go potting around and around.  I never understood why we were doing that.  Promenade your dinner.  I wish I knew more square dancing.  I know, right?  Trying to figure out how to fit steak martini into a rhyme.  Yeah.  It was very cool, though, because you got to touch a fucking girl in school. 
[00:20:00]  It was great.  You do that thing where swing your partner wasn't that good.  Elbows.  You can lock arms and fucking do that.  But there was that thing where you held.  She put her hand behind her back.  You grabbed that hand.  And then she put her hand in front of her.  And you grabbed that hand.  And so you're like, and I think that was Promenade or something.  And you were like touching her hand.  Your hand was on her belly.  It was on the small of her back.  You were fucking, that was fucking. 
[00:20:30]  Did you like that?  Yes.  And I just like, and then I thought about the girls I liked and what that would be like  with the girl I liked and just holding hands.  Like, I would, I would imagine like long walks holding hands as a kid.  I mean, as an eight-year-old, I'm imagining things that people do on fucking Christian Mingle.  What a douche.  No, you weren't.  You were just fucking Michael Corleone in fucking Sicily courting a young lady. 
[00:21:00]  Yes, young, young other friends of mine with dart guns, little suction cup dart guns protecting us from a vendetta.  Yeah, she gets on her big wheel.  She was going to drive the big wheel up to me, yes.  Yes.  But somebody put a firecracker in the wheel.  A Tuesday, Sunday, Monday.  Cry, baby, cry, baby on Wednesday, Friday.  A little fruit.  She like, hold her hand, like if you'd get the girl that you liked, would you hold your hand with hers for just like a second longer? 
[00:21:30]  Or try to make eye contact while you're holding hands?  I would just say, this is more than just a dance.  Yes, I would always try to make it more than it was.  I was under the impression it was.  She, not so much.  No.  Yeah, there was, there was a girl that I really liked.  It was the cousin of the girl that lived across the street from me.  And, um, she went to a whole nother school and everything.  I maybe saw her once a month.  And apparently, um, like I thought we were going out. 
[00:22:00]  What a dork.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, she was very, uh, very cute.  Did she think you were going out?  No.  We, we would go, you know, what kids do, you go to the stores, you know, you walk around the stores.  And go, just fucking, didn't have any money to buy anything or go anywhere.  So you just walked around the town and stuff.  And I thought because we were walking around, uh, that we were going out.  When did you find out that you weren't? 
[00:22:30]  Um, I guess when the girl across the street, um, told me that, uh, she, you know, wasn't coming anymore.  I'm not going to walk, I'm not going to walk to the store with you anymore.  Yeah, I thought she, you know, and I'm like, well, why would she do not, you know.  If, if she called right now and I had a way, I would get to where she is.  Right.  Because we're going out.  But then meanwhile, you know, she wouldn't drop everything to come and see me.  You're like, this has got to be reciprocal.  This is a two-way street, honey.  Love is a two-way street.  Yeah.  And I wasn't getting that back from her.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  So, uh, uh, no more walks to the store.  No more walks to the store.  No more, no more throwing stuff at Crazy John.  The guy that used to push the shopping cart full of junk around behind the stores.  And you'd throw things at him?  Always just something romantic, like heaving, heaving rocks at Crazy John.  At retarded gentlemen.  Heaving rocks at mentally disturbing older people.  That's what you'd do with the girl?  Yeah, we would throw things at him.  But then we would talk to him also.  Like, hey.  Hey, Crazy John, what do you got in your basket today? 
[00:23:30]  Right.  I got, uh, plastic bags.  He used to love plastic bags.  Why?  We would talk about that.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, yeah, so it was kind of, it was one of those situations where I would, I would always  blow things up in my head.  Just looking at Rich.  Speaking of retarded people.  Yes.  Let's throw rocks at Rich.  Do I have a backwards hat?  When did the, when did the, when did the, when did the innocents die?  Ah, that's, uh, that's good. 
[00:24:00]  When did I finally get a dose of reality?  Yeah.  Like, when did it, when was it like, this isn't working?  Let me go through the years.  10, 11, 12, 13, 13.  14, 14, 14, 14, around the virginity, losing, and you realize it's not so special at all.  Yeah, but I would still get completely head over heels infatuated with girls.  Just sit up at the table, uncomfortable.  Head up there, Rich, you dumb mother.  I'm being so shy. 
[00:24:30]  We're talking about, uh, you know, childhood girlfriends.  Childhood girlfriends, early, like, um, how you felt and how, what a faggot I was.  I was always crying in school, and I had a girl break up when, like, how old were you?  I called this girl, you know, I go, hey, how you doing?  And she goes, I don't want to go out with you anymore.  And I go, I thought it was her sister.  I go, put Kathy on the phone.  She goes, no, this is Kathy.  Oh.  And she, like, I, I was fighting her breaking up with me.  Every girl.  That always works.  I know.  When you have to talk a girl into continuing going out with you, you know, it's going to be a real nice relationship. 
[00:25:00]  I've had, everyone was the worst, where I caught, uh, the first girl I ever fell in love with banging my best friend.  That was the worst.  Oh.  Oh, oh, yeah.  I, I had, I had one of those.  Not a caught, but broke up with me and then went out with my best friend.  And, like, I just imagined them fucking, and it was just a, fuck, heart-wrenching.  I climbed up on a roof and saw them through the window.  Why were you up on the roof?  Well, here's the deal.  That's the name, that's the name of the movie, actually.  It was called A Cuckold is Born. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, I mean, I got a thousand of these fucking stories leading up to all probably last week.  Uh, you know, she'd pick me up from work every day, and then all of a sudden she'd...  You're talking a little older here.  How old was I?  Yeah, which was...  I was 21.  No, we're talking like seven, eight years old.  When you liked a girl, she doesn't like you back.  When you liked a girl, and it was like, you know, you'd, for me, holding hands is like sex, you know, back then.  You'd get that.  Yeah, but you're still dating those girls.  You asshole.  Uh, oh, I'm sorry. 
[00:26:00]  What happened when you were 13?  We're trying to figure out...  Because Anthony was this loving, creative kid, always crying at school.  Yeah.  And now he's...  Yeah.  Who wouldn't cry after their father raped him in the shower?  He never raped me in the shower.  He'd walk home early every day and go, guess who's dirty, Dad?  So what happened?  I guess, yeah, the losing virginity thing was pretty important as far as making that separation between just this hopeless crybaby romantical kid and, you know, the bitter gentleman I've become over the years. 
[00:26:30]  But...  Because it wasn't a special thing, and you knew Buzz didn't love you.  Uh, no?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  No, I know that.  It wasn't a special thing.  But I didn't want a special thing.  Like, I'm not...  I don't regret that it was that and not some big fucking whirlwind love fucking romance movie thing. 
[00:27:00]  I like the fact that it was just some fucking whore that I got to fucking get it out of my system.  How old were you when you got laid?  Uh, 13.  No.  Yeah, she was 19.  His father hooked up.  His father thought he was just gay.  He's like, let me get that crybaby's dick in a woman.  Look at his split.  And what did your father do to you?  Do you want to report with another boy?  He didn't have to.  I said, Dad, why are you throwing me under here?  I'll show you the faster way to get to the...  You got laid when you were 13?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  You could even get a heart on that young?  I guess.  Sure.  You know, I remember when me and my friend, we were literally, this is back in Edison,  so I was probably first grade, second grade, we would suck each other's penises, and he  got an erection.  And I didn't...  No, you say getting hard.  I didn't know...  My mind wouldn't get hard at that age.  I didn't know...  I was wondering why his did that.  I didn't understand what an erection was.  Wow.  At that age.  Me and somebody, we'd do that.  We'd touch each other, but, like, try to put it in, but nothing would happen because 
[00:28:00]  it couldn't get hard because we were too young.  You're trying to put it in where?  In his sock drawer.  You fucking idiot.  No, I'd like to know where, too, in his little Heidi?  Yeah.  He would rub it, and then he wanted me to sleep with him, but he wetted the bed, so I wouldn't.  And so did you.  You drooled on the pillow, and he pissed on the bed.  He wetted the bed.  You actually said that worse now than you would have back in. 
[00:28:30]  I liked a girl in kindergarten, and I wrote her a note.  I go, you look very pretty today, and she was so disgusted, I caught her eating pussy  right after it.  What?  No.  Oh, you fucking idiot.  That's hilarious.  How do you get laid when you're 13?  That's fucking, you're like a black kid.  No, it was, yeah.  My father kind of hooked it up.  I think, I think, like, my father probably knew I was just cranking it, like, in the bathroom 
[00:29:00]  every fucking night, and in the bedroom, like, jerking off like a goddamn maniac.  She was probably like, oh, God, this kid's got to fucking get laid.  So there was a girl, Buzz.  Yeah, I've told the story a thousand times.  A girl, Buzz, who just used to hang around.  She was 19, and she was recruited.  She was recruited big fucking tits.  Yeah.  Yeah, there were only white girls in San Juan Capistrano back in the 80s.  You never fooled around a black chick or a Spanish chick? 
[00:29:30]  Let me think.  Blowjob, nothing?  No, I'm all white.  I used to fuck this black chick.  She was so hot, and I'd come so quick.  I didn't, and I would apologize, and she'd go, it doesn't matter, it's not big enough  anyhow.  Oh, she would say that?  Pretty much.  Wow.  I mean, she already was a fucking big fucking gapping pussy.  Oh, man.  You know, there was nothing you could do to that unless you were fucking, you know, Patrick  Ewing or something.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  You know, and she was so hot, man.  I'm just not attracted to black chicks.  I've seen a couple over the years that I have deemed attractive for a black chick.  Lucky them.  Exactly.  Yeah.  But I just, I'm just, you know, it doesn't do anything for me.  Sam almost looks like a black chick.  Sam would only date black chicks.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  His wife is like his first white fucking girl.  And she's a very white young lady. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Very white girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, when I was, from when I was in high school, but I was always in relationships,  but yeah, yeah, I used to only really date black girls.  In high school?  Mm-hmm.  And you didn't get tormented?  No.  Did you go to a white high school or a black high school?  No, it was probably like 40% white and then a lot of black and Hispanic kids.  Oh, boy.  That would be 60%.  Did you get beat up?  No.  You fit in very well.  Yeah, I kind of, you know, I was able to go from crowd to crowd. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You were like the liaison.  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  I brought the communities together.  You did.  The Rainbow Coalition.  You're a regular fucking peacemaker.  That's right.  Look at that.  And then you started dating their women.  How did they feel about that?  Well, I didn't really date like the super ghetto black chicks.  No?  Yeah.  Suburbanized black chicks?  I don't know if the black girls would hang out with white people anyway.  The ones that they expect.  The ones that black guys would expect to date a white guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you're so just, no one knows what you are. 
[00:31:30]  So it's kind of like.  Oh, man.  Fuck it.  I don't.  What the fuck is that, motherfucker?  You'd only show up with your hair.  Nobody would see your face.  And they'd go, that's one of us.  Yeah.  I had hair like that in school.  Big afro and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you?  Oh, fuck yeah.  It was just a terrible.  Horrible afro.  Just terrible.  Well, look at guys with like great fucking hair.  The hair that like.  All they had to do was take their fingers and run it backwards through their hair and flip  their head back.  And it was fine.  I couldn't even get my hand like an inch through my hair. 
[00:32:00]  The nappy headed motherfucker.  I was.  I had this crybaby nappy head.  This big fucking horrible afro.  And I hated it.  And everybody.  And I went to New York and got my hair cut in a shag.  Like, you know, the shag.  And it was fucking.  It looked so fucking good the first day.  Yeah.  And then when I tried to blow dry it myself, it just took off.  And now my hair was shag afro.  It was fucking.  Shag fro.  You know the shag that like David Cassidy had.  Yeah.  That's the hair you wanted. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  That's the hair you wanted as a kid like that growing up.  Fuck.  You just.  Just do a dumb big fucking afro.  I used to have so much dandruff when I was a kid.  Oh, no.  I swear to God.  I would always sit too close to the TV.  Like probably.  Like we had this wooden coffee table.  And I would rest my right arm on it and sit on the floor.  And like it was probably from me to Anthony.  Like maybe two feet away from the TV.  And I actually wore out the top of the table rubbing.  And there's times when I would have dandruff.  And I would just put my head over the fucking wood table. 
[00:33:00]  And I would just scratch my head and literally cake it with fucking flaked dandruff.  I had so much dandruff.  Snow globe head.  That was a big thing for me was that somebody in school would say if I had dandruff, I would be so embarrassed.  What kid has dandruff?  What an old man thing to have as a kid.  I know.  Oh, God.  And you could cure with a dollar shampoo. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I had so much dandruff.  I had to find out it was just dried cum from the janitor.  Dude, I paid flakes.  Fuck it.  I would feel it.  Like you scratch your head.  You could feel like.  You feel almost like waxy when you have so much dandruff.  Oh, God damn.  It was terrible.  Who has that much dandruff?  I was very dirty.  Were you a dirty kid?  Yes, I was.  Were you a dirty boy?  Yes, I was.  How often would you shower when you were there? 
[00:34:00]  I hated showering.  They had to make me do it.  Oh, I bet.  Gross.  I wonder why.  Did you stink?  Oh, boy.  I don't think I ever stunk.  No.  Listen, if you had that much dandruff, believe you me, your underarms weren't fucking.  My hair was always greasy.  I knew that.  I told you when I was in high school, Lynn, who I thought was really beautiful.  I was like a fucking sophomore and we sat next to each other.  And, oh, no, this was, I was sitting in front of her and I had a crush on this girl who sat 
[00:34:30]  behind me and Lynn was in front of me and she was going, why don't you wash your hair?  Oh.  And I said, I was just ignoring it like I didn't hear it.  And she goes, why don't you wash your hair?  And I said, it is washed.  And I kicked her chair.  I was in high school.  You were lying.  It is washed.  It was, it was, it is washed.  Even in high school you weren't washing yourself?  No.  Ew.  Oh, wow. 
[00:35:00]  So Ann was crying and you were just the kid who smelled like dirty hair all the time?  Yeah, my hair stunk.  See what makes great radio people?  Fucking just outcasts.  I would go days in high school without washing my hair.  What?  I would go days in high school without washing my hair.  It was, it was really long.  You know what though?  That was the look when you were growing up.  That's true.  It was very grungy.  Greasy, grungy, fucking long hair.  I was also told one time by a girl that I should really brush my teeth.  Oh.  I guess I hadn't like brushed my teeth in a day or two. 
[00:35:30]  One told me I should remove mine.  Fucking rotten teeth.  It's horrible.  Wow.  What did you say when she said that to you?  I said, okay.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  What an awful comeback that is.  It was always the hot girls.  It was the girl at the bagel store.  In our school, there were some really, really fucking hot girls.  Yeah.  And they all went out with like the fucking black football players for a while.  Like that was like the thing.  White chicks?  Yeah.  And I mean, they were so hot. 
[00:36:00]  Like now they probably look back and fucking hate themselves.  But I mean, these girls were so hot and you were just even intimidated to talk to them.  Oh, you didn't have a chance.  Not at all.  Not a fucking prayer.  I was a drug dealer in school.  I sold pot and stuff.  So you got that in.  You should have been able to get some.  No.  You just got the skank girls.  I got that.  What are you kidding me?  What a fucking joint.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One came to my house one day who liked me and she knocked on my door. 
[00:36:30]  Like I never went to school.  I showed up every now and then.  And she came to my door with a heart and my name on her.  What, drawn on her jeans?  On her jeans.  And I looked and I just slammed the door and went upstairs.  She was posing.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  You know what?  I always thought, too, that I was going to be able to get some of these girls that I would  fantasize about walking hand in hand with. 
[00:37:00]  And then the girls that would end up liking me were just fucking like, you know, slobs  or fucking not the popular girls.  I was just as guilty as, you know, shit running downhill.  I'd get shit on.  So I would just shit on somebody else.  Like everybody in school does.  It's called bullying now.  Back then it was just called growing up.  Yeah.  And there was a girl that liked me and she wanted to go out with me.  And it was kind of a vague thing.  But I think I said yes to her.  And then this other girl who wanted to go out with me said, oh, you know, you're going 
[00:37:30]  out with her.  She's telling everybody.  I went, really?  She goes, yeah, you don't want to do that.  Everyone hates her.  And she stinks.  And there's it.  And then just bad mouthing her.  And she got me so paranoid that I, that second I opened up the classroom door that she  was in and said, no, we're not going out.  Like I didn't want this to continue another second.  In the middle of her class?  Yes.  With people thinking that, that we were going out.  Oh, you humiliated her.  I did.  That's, she probably thinks about that to this day. 
[00:38:00]  Yes.  It's the greatest moment.  That's when things turned for me.  I didn't have the courage to break up with him.  So my friends went and talked to him and to break up with me.  We were going out for a shorter time than fucking Kirk's father was captain of the  Kelvin.  It's a Star Trek joke.  So wait, you yelled out, we're not going out?  Yes.  We fucking yelled, that's it.  I was like, no, we're not going out. 
[00:38:30]  And then shut the door.  And that was the last I ever spoke to her.  I remember when I was in high school, they asked me, these kids, one of my divorce settled  the same way.  Lawyers said different.  Yelling to the court, we're not going out.  I'm fucking this girl now.  Yeah.  I, uh, in high school, these kids asked me to hold up a sign.  They said, walk up to that classroom and hold up the sign.  There was a big glass window.  So I did.  I didn't even look at the sign.  What?  Are you insane?  I was just dumb. 
[00:39:00]  Dirty and dumb.  Apparently it was this fucking racist, this girl was dating an Indian guy, so it had  something with a dot on it and some nasty comment.  And I held up to the window.  You're like Bruce Willis in Die Hard 2, was it?  Or 3, which one?  Where he had to wear the fucking I hate niggers sandwich board in Harlem.  They actually put that in in post.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They didn't want to offend him.  There it is.  He had to wear that.  What do you mean they could have put it in during the movie? 
[00:39:30]  That wasn't live.  No, because they didn't want him walking around Harlem like that.  Very disrespectful.  So they put it in post.  What do you mean?  They dubbed it in?  I mean, he had to.  Dubbed it in.  Dubbed it in.  Very good.  Nobody answered him.  Yes, dubbed it in, Rich.  It's magic.  They teach the I.  It's magic.  Here's Rich Voss, a filmmaker, not knowing how that's done.  Yeah, they dubbed it in.  They dubbed it in.  Yeah, whatever they call it, you know.  Yeah, it was the same effect they used to make two Patty Dukes.  They were identical cousins. 
[00:40:00]  Two of a kind.  They look the light.  They don't the light.  But they're cousins.  They're two of a kind.  Yes, Jimmy?  No, it was it.  I just held up a sign.  It didn't go anywhere.  What was it, though?  Is it like Doddhead?  I don't remember.  It was racist.  That's all I know.  Did you get in trouble?  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I think I got called down.  I was like, yeah, these guys are just going to hold it up.  And they were like, what kind of idiot kid are you? </pre>
