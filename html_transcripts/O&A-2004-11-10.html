<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with numerous commercial breaks punctuated by repeated announcements of "We'll be right back."  The hosts expressed frustration over office renovation delays and a lack of support from their company, complaining about insufficient marketing and comedic bit development.  A caller, Glenn from New Mexico, inquired about a listener webcam, prompting further complaints about company inaction.  The hostsâ€™ breakfast woes, specifically Opie's lack of a cereal bowl, were highlighted, eventually resolved (and rejected) by a listener's contribution.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a phone call with "Stalker Patty" and her alcoholic, unemployed friend "Lady Di."  The conversation focused on Patty's unsuccessful attempts to help Lady Di find work, devolving into a heated argument about Lady Di's lifestyle and refusal to get help.

The broadcast included a bizarre array of topics: a listener flashing someone on the Long Island Expressway; Bobcat Goldthwait recounting his arson arrest and subsequent commercial punishment; numerous "midget sighting" anecdotes from callers; a discussion about Kuwaiti culture, including comments on women's treatment and male hand-holding/interactions with young boys;  a PSA-style segment on "wowing" (breast flashing); and more workplace annoyance complaints.

Further chaotic segments featured discussions about bizarre items for sale (Darryl Strawberry's colon, Caminetti's nose, a bloody sock); a recurring bit called "Monster Rain" detailing oral sex between young boys, accompanied by graphic listener-submitted songs (especially one by "Imaginary Bill"); and a call from 19-year-old Ashley, who had previously disclosed having sex with her father's best friend.  Ashley provided an update on being kicked out of her home and staying in a hotel paid for by the man, while her furious mother, Janice, also participated in the call.  Ashley confirmed her intention to continue the relationship.  The segment also included a highly offensive and vulgar prank call to a bar owner, a song about a penis, a shallot cooking tip, and various other incoherent listener calls. The show experienced repeated computer crashes.

Another segment involved "Guess What's in My Pants," where caller Kathy described sounds made by rubbing her post-tummy tuck genitals on her phone, leading to guesses about her pubic hair style.  The hosts also discussed her lack of panties at work.  A prank call followed, with an employee, Eric, posing as a Tony Danza superfan who won money on *Family Feud*. Opie and Anthony, impersonating Danza, made a sexually explicit proposition for a blowjob.  They later discussed car "black box" recorders, Easy Pass, and OnStar privacy concerns, and a caller's girlfriend squirting during sex, along with evading New Jersey tolls.  The hosts mentioned a planned Thanksgiving Eve show and their *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* cameo.

The show featured a rambling spoken-word piece, a highly offensive discussion comparing dating white and black women, and a call with Rich Voss about his long-distance relationship and his girlfriend's dark humor, including rape jokes.  The Easy Pass toll system was debated.  A profane musical rendition of *Silence of the Lambs* was played, with Channel 9 reporter Pat Collins present to film B-roll.  The hosts discussed Collins' presence and her views on the show's potential for outrageousness on satellite radio, also touching upon her opinions of *The Passion of the Christ* and *Fahrenheit 9/11*.  The show included Orson Welles commercial outtakes filled with profanity.  A short interview with Pat Collins concluded this section.

Finally, the show opened a segment by noting that listeners appreciated their open discussion of adult subjects more than stunts.  The "hottest sexual subject" was debated, leading to crude commentary on a news story about an older woman and her eight-year-old boyfriend.  An upcoming interview with Pat Collins was mentioned briefly, followed by a rambling discussion about New York accents, interspersed with commercial breaks, including one for XM Satellite Radio's college basketball coverage.

[00:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:07:00]  It should be at this point, but it's freezing in New York, but we've got to remember this 
[00:07:30]  is being broadcast. 
[00:08:00]  I sure hope that I sure hope that some of the ladies down there will flash their boobies  if they'll be right back. 
[00:08:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:09:00]  You're out the door. 
[00:09:30]  Let's face it. 
[00:10:00]  Look around at 4 a. 
[00:10:30]  They're bar whores. 
[00:11:00]  Even though the company, even though the company, even though the company doesn't want us walking. 
[00:11:30]  Today, he wouldn't have got much. 
[00:12:00]  I want to be racist. 
[00:12:30]  I want to go to the street. 
[00:13:00]  No, I wish. 
[00:13:30]  They're in Florida. 
[00:14:00]  They got anything in Florida. 
[00:14:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:15:00]  They're in there today. 
[00:15:30]  And it's just a facade. 
[00:16:00]  It's pretty much happening every day. 
[00:16:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:17:00]  Good idea.  And put it up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com.  The boys would like Steve to take some pictures.  Just to show you what we're up against because they're just taking their sweet old time.  And then we bitch and complain, you know, we're in there. 
[00:17:30]  We're in there. 
[00:18:00]  We're in there, head down, head down, head down, head down, and there's an electrical cable, and there's an electrical cable hanging from the ceiling in between us. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, well, isn't that great.  Yeah, well, isn't that great?  Yeah, well, isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  It might make for a good picture?  I don't know.  We need an office.  Is there even a timeline?  Has anyone even said when the office might be working?  By July.  They're saying definitely by July.  Oh, yeah, out of doubt by July.  You know, at this point, I just give up on things.  I just give up, you know?  Anthony and I, you know, we're mother effers, and we are very motivated, and, you know, we are the best radio show in America, and we want the people around us to realize that.  But I guess eventually they'll realize that, and they'll catch up to us, you know? 
[00:19:00]  But I give up.  Yeah.  I give up on the office.  I give up on the marketing.  I give up on, you know, maybe a variety of good comedy bits when we go to break.  I just give up on all that, because you can only yell and scream long enough before you don't have enough energy to deal with it.  So we'll deal with what we have control of, and that's our radio show.  When these mics are live, I know it's going to be good radio.  Because we control it.  We don't have to depend on anybody else.  If I have to hear Dutch Clutch all day long, if I have to hear that dice bit again, or the Red Fox one, about the hippopotamus lips. 
[00:19:30]  See, is this the first week of us being on the air?  No, we're six weeks into it, and it's still the same problem, which means the system they have in place just doesn't work.  So we have to figure something else out.  So I give up.  I just give up.  This is my spot right here in the studio.  This will be my space now for quite some time.  This is mine right here.  I don't foresee an office with a desk or anything. 
[00:20:00]  Stuff like that.  Let's say hi to Glenn in New Mexico.  Hey, Glenn.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, buddy?  Nothing.  Hey, when's that webcam coming up?  Yeah.  When are we going to be able to tie into that?  Waiting for an answer.  Waiting for an answer?  August, sir.  August, we're going to have that webcam set up.  They're working on it.  It's killing me.  It's killing me to hear all these chicks come in and not be able to see it.  Well, we have these cameras set up so they can watch us for some reason.  It's like, screw that.  If we're on camera during the time we're on the air, then let's share with our listeners. 
[00:20:30]  Most of the time it'll be boring stuff, but you'll be able to pop in on us.  It'll probably be pretty cool to check out from time to time.  Just pop in on ONA.  Type it in and boom, there we are.  All right.  Well, we're just waiting on that as well, Glenn.  So maybe we'll have an answer by mid-December on that one.  All right?  Can I ask you a question?  All right.  They're too busy coming up with new corporate lingo down there to be bothered with things that matter.  Yes, Jimmy?  Does this look like a bowl to you?  Oh, no. 
[00:21:00]  No, they didn't give you that as a bowl.  Yeah, I asked for a bowl so I could have a little cereal.  You got a plastic container that like a sandwich would come in from a deli.  I don't like how you count on your breakfast food by staring over here and seeing what I brought in.  Why not?  Why don't you bring in some food?  I brought in some coffee money.  I got you coffee.  I figured it's a fair trade.  I get you coffee.  No, I told you to buy me coffee.  Well, I knew I'd have to do something.  This is my bowl for breakfast.  It's a little plastic thing that the delis have. 
[00:21:30]  I can't tell you how bad I want to bite somebody.  That'll work as a bowl.  No, it won't work.  Where do you find a bowl in New York City at 620 in the morning?  A lot of places.  You don't?  Where?  Any place that would sell cereal.  A deli.  A deli?  Yeah.  It would have something better than a sandwich holder.  It's probably dirty.  Oh, it probably is just filthy.  All right, really fast.  There's fecal matter in it.  We'll get you a bowl.  Relax.  Let's say hi to Stalker Patty.  We've got to get an update here.  Stalker Patty.  Hey, how are you?  Good.  What's going on today? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, nothing much.  Nothing much has happened so far.  I just woke up.  All right.  Sweet dreams.  Did you have sweet dreams last night?  Yeah, I did.  Dreaming of not being a virgin anymore?  Oh, no.  I don't know.  I don't remember what I dreamed.  I woke up.  My bed was wet.  I think I'm a squirter.  My cat.  Actually, I just sleep with my cat.  I have a pet that gets right into the bed with me. 
[00:22:30]  Poor cat.  I know.  Imagine you're looking out.  It's like, oh, anyone could have adopted me.  I could have been in a nice house, but here I am living with Patty.  Patty's twat is like catnip for the cat because it hasn't been washed out in 20 years.  Patty, do you rub a little cat food down there and let them lick away with that sandpaper tongue?  No, I'm not that desperate.  What do you mean you're not that desperate?  I'm not that desperate.  Yes, you are.  Yes, you are. 
[00:23:00]  You're as desperate as they come.  You haven't had sex ever, ever, and you're 50 years old.  Well, don't worry.  I'm not worried.  Trust me, I'm not worried.  I don't lose sleep over the fact that you're still a virgin.  Well, first of all, I've got to find a boyfriend, and then I can get busy.  All right.  Well, where are we?  Get busy.  Slow down on the lingo.  I'm going to get busy.  You won't be getting busy until you're having sex for 20 years.  You'll lay there and take it.  I'll make up for less time. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  Well, where are we with finding a gynecologist to check out Stark and Patty's twat?  No one has come to the table.  It's amazing.  We get emails about everything under the sun, and people want to help us.  Not one.  What's wrong, Jim?  Jim, he's hard.  What are you doing?  You just took us out.  He asked for a bowl, and he got us.  I didn't take anything.  Now we all have to look at you.  No, you don't.  I didn't take anything.  Go back to what you were doing.  What happened?  Nothing.  That's a nice bowl.  Are you mad at the bowl now?  No, no.  I want to eat something, a bowl out of shit that people have been eating out of for six months.  That's what you want to eat your breakfast out of. 
[00:24:00]  Someone just brought in a bowl, and it's, I don't know.  Are there any facilities to wash things around here?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  I won't.  It's not important.  Just come back.  Oh, poor Jim.  I'm not eating out of a bowl that somebody else has used.  I'm not doing it.  Go ahead.  But you can just...  Not happening.  No, I wouldn't either.  I understand.  You can just wash the bowl out.  It's very nice that he went and brought in a bowl, but the truth of the matter is, you can't  eat out of a bowl.  You don't know where it's been.  The guy was happy.  He came in all excited like he solved your bowl problem, and you don't like that bowl.  Absolutely not.  You don't know where it's been.  Does it look dirty?  It doesn't matter.  I'd rather eat it out of Patty's box. 
[00:24:30]  I'm not eating cereal out of a bowl that Frank Sinatra guy was probably losing his hair  in two weeks ago.  Jimmy's in a bad mood today.  I love it.  I do like when you're in a...  I'm asleep, man.  I'm really...  I love when Norton's in a bad mood.  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kids.  All right, Patty.  So, I don't even know what we were talking about because we had a look at Norton's bowl.  Oh, yeah.  The gynecologist, Ben?  No.  We still can't find a gynecologist?  This lady hasn't had her vag checked out in 20 years.  Who would want to look at that? 
[00:25:00]  Dude, this...  Well, the gynecologist, you know, they take an oath.  Yeah, this sworn oath that they must care for these people.  Yeah, the oath is they can't turn down a vagina.  No.  They get the really hot 17-year-old girl coming in for her first visit, and then they get  the 85-year-old lady that wants to make sure, you know, it's still happening.  That's the same oath Jimmy took.  You can't turn down a vagina no matter what it's stuck on.  70-year-old women.  All right, Patty.  What's going on with Lady Di?  Nothing.  I haven't gotten anything yet.  I'm still waiting. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, she hasn't sent over her resume?  Yeah, if you guys haven't followed this little soap opera...  Shut up!  Patty.  Shut up.  Be a good listener.  We need listeners on this show.  I was trying to set you up.  Okay.  Ugh.  Stalker Patty's trying to find Lady Di a job is all I wanted to say.  Yeah, she's been out of work for quite a while.  She's a drunk.  And she gets fired from her jobs.  And now Patty's trying to step up and help her out.  She said give her her resume and she'll... 
[00:26:00]  And you still haven't gotten the resume from Lady Di?  Not at all.  Huh.  Lady Di!  How you doing?  Good.  Patty, I sent you the resume.  I haven't gotten it yet.  I don't know.  I sent it to you the other day.  What a liar.  You are a liar.  Well, you know, if you sent it the other day, it takes a couple days.  I'll give you till Friday for that resume.  Okay.  But if you sent it the other day, I know how the mail works.  Right, yeah.  I used to say the same thing about bills. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, I sent that check.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I did.  I'm sounding all sincere.  No, really.  I sent the check.  I think Patty would be an ass as a boss.  You could just hear it in her voice.  If she had a little power...  She does have a little power.  It could give you a...  So, Lady Di, where did you send the resume?  No, I did send the resume.  I did.  Where?  Where did you send it?  I put it in the mail.  To where?  From where I live.  I put it right in the mail.  Where did you...  The mailman took it and...  Who was it addressed to? 
[00:27:00]  Why are we dealing with retards this early in the morning?  It was addressed to Patty.  And where does Patty live?  Like, just give a...  Well, I'm not going to say where she lives,  but she lives in New York, New York.  That's okay.  And where did you mail...  When did you mail it?  I mailed it about maybe two, three days ago.  Right now.  Well, she should have gotten it.  Well, you know, she will get it.  She'll get the resume.  You're lying.  You didn't mail it two or three days ago.  She's such a liar.  I did.  No, you didn't.  Yes, I did. 
[00:27:30]  You know, I did.  So, what can I tell you?  Yeah.  Okay.  And you're looking forward to maybe getting a job?  Yes, I am.  And waking up and going to work on a daily basis instead of hanging out at night getting drunk?  No, no, no.  I don't do that.  You absolutely do.  We called you the other day, and you were drinking with two guys in your apartment or house or wherever you live.  Stop it.  She tries to diffuse it by laughing, but you just know it's just a mess. 
[00:28:00]  I thought you had a job as the sheik's lawyer.  No.  All right.  Well, there's nothing here, right?  And the what?  No.  This thing isn't developing at all.  All right.  So, Stark and Patty, why don't you call us when you get Lady Di's resume, all right?  Oh, I will.  She'll get it pretty soon.  All right.  She'll get the resume.  Let me make a prediction.  She will not get that.  No, the office will be finished before she gets that resume, fat, lazy, slug.  You know what she told me that really bothers me?  She says that if she has a job, she'll lose her public assistance. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you're one of those people.  Oh, you'd rather stay on the welfare.  And that might be a hesitancy that you get so dependent on something, you know?  Yeah, that's right, Patty.  I'm not saying anything.  Oh, she doesn't want to lose her public assistance.  So, you'd rather stay on the welfare than get a job?  Well, you know, let me tell you something right now.  I'm looking out there.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am. 
[00:29:00]  All right.  Where was the last place you looked?  The other day.  Where?  Oh, let me see.  The other day is not the answer to where, you ass.  She's pounding the pavement.  She does it every day.  Just walking is pounding the pavement.  What day was that?  Dunkin' Donuts?  Where?  No, no, no.  Crossing guard.  Crossing guard?  Yes.  I tried for that.  You tried for that?  I put an application in for that.  You know, these people, they have to call me back in order for me to go back there again.  Would you call you back if you wandered into a school with that awful stringy hair and alcohol in your breath? 
[00:29:30]  I want to cross children.  Idiot.  It is not like that at all.  You look like throw mama from the train.  Oh.  You really do.  You're not saying that to me.  It's the truth, though.  We haven't seen you in two years.  I don't know what the hell happened to you in our time off.  Let my hair grow.  That's all.  Well, how about you wash it?  I wash it every day.  You don't.  Yes, I do.  You wash it with oil. 
[00:30:00]  Probably Wesson oil.  No, I don't.  All right.  So what's going on with the crossing guard thing?  They just haven't called you back?  They put in an application, and I guess they're going to call me back whenever an opening comes up.  They can't hire you as a crossing guard because the cars would never go.  They'd stop thinking there was a truck in the street.  Never.  No.  I thought Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall.  That's the last job I put in for.  Who's in the background?  A friend of mine that's, you know, he's just having a cigarette and stuff like that. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Why are they up at this hour?  Well, because, well, there's only one person here, and the phone woke him up.  Yeah.  So he's having a cigarette.  And what was he doing there?  Huh?  And what was he doing there?  Hanging out last night?  No.  He's in the other room.  Are you having sex with this person?  No, no, no, no.  Another party at Lady Di's last night, perhaps?  No.  A little late night drinking, hanging out? 
[00:31:00]  Another drunk from the local bar?  No, no, no, and no, and no.  What's the name of your little club there?  Lady Di's Welfare Flophouse?  No.  Ugh.  Welfare mothers make better lovers.  Oh.  No, that is not true at all.  Ugh.  All right, so you're not having sex with this guy.  You just drink a lot with him.  No.  Just a roommate that stays in another room.  She's lying.  She's dying for this guy to bang him.  You are a compulsive liar, Lady Di.  No, I am not.  Yes, you are.  Everyone knows it, and everyone says it, even Marion. 
[00:31:30]  No.  You're a compulsive liar.  You're incapable of telling the truth.  Yeah, do you want to have sex with this guy?  No.  Why not?  Because he's just a friend.  Ugh.  He says he's just a friend.  Oh, baby.  And he'd probably rather fuck Biz Markie than her.  No difference.  All right, we're getting out of this.  This is boring.  Lady Di, we'll check in with you, all right?  Check in with me.  You go ahead and do that.  Go get some help, please. 
[00:32:00]  We say it every time we talk to you.  Stop drinking.  Stop drinking.  Yeah, you've got to get off the sauce.  There's drinking, and then there's drinking.  We saw you.  The alcohol is taking effect.  Your face is bloated.  Your liver is not working that well these days.  I could just see it by looking at you.  All I've got to do is exercise, and I'll be okay.  And, you know, the drinking, I did cut back on that.  You've got to stop. 
[00:32:30]  Okay.  Stop with the cut back.  Just cut the drinking out.  Go to a meeting.  All right.  Thank you.  Stalker Patty, any final thoughts?  I wonder how she appeared when she went to that interview.  Did she get dressed?  Did she look nice?  They're not going to give you a dress?  I had nice clothes for that.  You don't have it.  You know, you've got to dress for success.  You've got to dress in business.  Oh, my God.  Patty's telling us she's got to dress for success.  You know, even a dishwasher gets dressed up for his interview. 
[00:33:00]  I hate to admit this, but I love the new Patty.  Patty is motivated.  She's a go-getter.  If you guys only knew, Patty was a mess, too, when we first met her.  But look at Patty making something of her life.  Patty, are you on any kind of medication?  No, I'm not.  Just so beautiful for asthma.  She's like one of those little yappy dogs.  She needs medication for her asthma.  Patty's like Adrian.  She's just a mess.  Yeah, but she's getting her act together.  She's getting her act together. 
[00:33:30]  She doesn't sell turtles anymore.  I could see Lady Di showing up for a job interview.  Did you have one of your big T-shirts on and that tinfoil bling you wear around your neck?  No, I don't go like that for job interviews.  Were you wearing a smart pants suit?  Maybe a smart pants suit, but no.  Well, what did you have on?  Huh?  What did you have on?  Well, I have nice pants on and I have a nice shirt. 
[00:34:00]  A nice shirt.  Did it have buttons on it or did it pull over?  Buttons.  Buttons on the shirt.  Yeah.  If it has Mickey Mouse in the front, it's not a nice shirt.  Yeah, it's not a nice shirt.  No, it doesn't have Mickey Mouse in the front.  All right.  Why are we continuing?  I don't know.  I'm fascinated.  All right.  Starker Pat, anything else?  No, not at all.  So you ought to invest with somebody smart.  You ought to go to a brokerage firm and invest your money.  Oh, man.  Lady Di, you don't even know what that means. 
[00:34:30]  The fake laugh again.  All right.  Thank you, Lady Di.  It's too early in the morning.  Okay.  Lady Di, Lady Di.  What?  Okay.  Starker Patty?  Yes.  Have a good day.  All right.  You too.  Bye-bye.  There she goes.  Can't help it.  I love the new Starker Patty.  Lady Di, you know, you ought to eat from the four food groups.  She's just a bevy of knowledge, of helpful knowledge these days.  She takes control, though.  It's hilarious.  She was a mess that slept under the stairs in our studio. 
[00:35:00]  Now she's like a go-getter.  And now she's the one telling everybody how to better their lives.  Hey, Doug, what's going on?  Yeah.  Going back to Norton's little cereal bowl there.  Yeah.  He'll stick his tongue up a whore's asshole, but he won't eat out of a cereal bowl.  Yeah.  Isn't that classic?  We used to talk about this, and I've given up on that, too.  I don't get it.  You're right.  I can't even argue.  I know it's not consistent.  You will take a log in the face, but a bowl that looks relatively clean that you can even  wash out more, you won't use. 
[00:35:30]  I don't get it.  Oh, now what am I doing?  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Dude, you're up to one, two, three, four bowls.  There are four bowls, I think.  No, there's not.  There's two bowls.  There's this odd little Ziploc thing, which we'll serve as a bowl, and there's this thing,  which is not a bowl.  It's a sandwich container.  You could use mine.  No, I can't.  Why?  I clean it out.  Absolutely not.  No.  You're eating another man's bowl.  That's gay.  That is totally gay.  You eat ass.  So what?  I'm not saying it's right.  Not yours. 
[00:36:00]  Exactly.  At least I don't want to stand there and smell it while I'm urinating, swamp ass.  All right.  Jesus.  All right, Doug, you bring up a good point.  We don't get what that's about either, so.  All right.  We have to go to Marion.  You brought me this.  Oh, no.  The other half of the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Yes, Marion.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  How's everybody doing?  Great, Marion.  I just want to let you know that Diane has-  What is this, retard hour?  Diane-  Get Corky on the phone for our celebrity interview.  Diane has been looking for a job. 
[00:36:30]  I've sent this to some places, too.  Oh, really?  And you know why?  I tell her that you give places like four or five days.  If they don't call you back, then you call them.  But you see, she's not driving right now because her vehicle's complete, you know?  Oh, so her car is broken down?  Yeah, her car is broke.  And she's just, like, walking to places and bus in it.  So, you know, it's tough.  Believe me.  She's fine.  She's on a slippery slope, broken down car, no job.  Before you know it, she's going to be homeless.  She's running a flop house. 
[00:37:00]  She is on public assistance because I told her to go to public assistance for help.  Doesn't she have a kid?  Before she was going to end up being homeless, I told her to go for help.  Believe me.  When I was in my 20s, I had the same problem that she had.  Yeah, how old is she?  But she's not in her 20s.  She's 42.  I know that.  But see, when you work in a place so long and they get rid of you, it's very hard to find something close to what you were making.  All right.  You know.  Why'd they get rid of her?  I don't know the whole story. 
[00:37:30]  What do you think?  Tell us.  It had something to do with her drinking.  It's none of my business.  It had something to do with her drinking, right?  It's none of my business.  Oh, that means yes.  No, it's none.  It's none of my business.  I'm smart.  There is a friend of hers that's also a friend of mine who works there.  And they didn't just get rid of Diane.  They got rid of about 25, 30 people.  All right.  Who's the guy at the same time?  Who's the guy at Lady Di's house?  I don't know.  I don't know him because I never met him.  But I know her other friend.  And he seems okay. 
[00:38:00]  I mean, these people, this guy that stays there, he's pretty cool.  I mean, I've called her up, and we've got her on the phone and talked.  Is he paying her rent or something?  He's helping her out.  Helping her out, huh?  In other words, he's like, you know, he takes her places.  Since her car is not drivable right now, he does take her places where she can go put applications.  Drops her off to clients?  No, come on.  No, I mean, this, you know, guys.  Less than zero.  I'm listening to it.  Die gives good head and is dead.  Guys, I'm listening to it.  And, come on, she really is trying. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, she's in the jam right now.  Yeah, but, you know, she's having a hard time.  Marion, we talked to her last week.  She'd be in the jam trying to walk through a door.  We talked to her last week.  It was like a Wednesday morning, and she was S-faced.  I don't know because I was already at work.  But the reason why I'm still home is because I don't have to work today.  I have to go to jury duty.  But, yeah, go ahead and laugh.  Imagine looking over at the jury where your life is hinged and looking over and Marion is sitting there.  And you look at this cross-eyed freak. 
[00:39:00]  Hey.  DNA evidence.  You got a fat muppet deciding your life.  Hey, Jim.  What's DNA?  How do you spell that?  Idiot.  I'm going to see you on Saturday.  I'm coming for that show, and I hope you bomb.  All right.  Thank you.  You know, why?  Why are we doing this to ourselves?  All right, Marion.  Thank you.  Marion, you can't hope I bomb.  That's very bad luck.  No, no, no.  I hope you bomb on Saturday.  I'm only kidding, Jimmy.  I love you.  You know that.  Who are you all coming with? 
[00:39:30]  My husband.  Are you guys doing anything else?  Or are you just coming to the stupid show?  Yes, me and my husband are going because Diane can't go.  There's a reason why she can't go.  She doesn't have trains for her.  And I'm not going to give her the train fare to go.  Because then she'll want me to buy her a drink, and I'm not going to do that.  You know, I'm trying to get her to stop, you know, cut back.  Hello?  They hung up.  Who is she holding that?  They hung up.  They hung up.  All right. 
[00:40:00]  In honor of retard hour to start the program.  I find the evidence very compelling.  Right.  Oh, could you just see her sitting there in that jury box?  I think she might be the juror that's messing up the Scott Peterson trial.  Scott Peterson.  Scott Peterson.  I have a problem with one of the jurors.  I wonder if it's her.  Your Honor, can I look at the boat again?  I don't think it could hold the weight of the body in the cinder block.  So let me put my head.  My head is just like a cinder block. 
[00:40:30]  I'll put it in the boat, and we'll see if it can float.  Your Honor, that's very.  I think we can't reach a decision just to be a mistrack.  A mistrack.  The old jury booth probably looks like a whack-a-mole game of wacky characters in there.  Just an awful head sitting in that jury booth.  Well, those are the type of people they get on the jury, man.  Everyone else is smart enough to figure out how to get out of it. 
[00:41:00]  We're going to be sequestered?  What does that mean?  Sequestered.  All right.  In honor of all the retards calling the first hour, Anthony.  Yeah.  I got an O&A classic that one of our listeners sent in.  Ooh, look at that.  We got that album back.  Yeah, we're slowly but surely getting our stuff back, thanks to our listeners.  And here you go.  Retard singing on the Opie and Anthony show.  You better watch out or the incest will get you. 
[00:41:30]  You better watch out or the incest will get you.  If you accidentally fall in the water, you're in trouble. 
[00:42:00]  Spiders will get out of you.  You better watch out or the incest will get you.  You better watch out or the incest will get you.  You better watch out or the incest will get you. 
[00:42:30]  You better watch out or the incest will get you. 
[00:43:00]  You better watch out or the incest will get you.  You better watch out, or the insects will get you  You better watch out, or the insects will get you 
[00:43:30]  Fights will try to steal your food  We don't like them, they're disgusting  Get the bugs right fast, yes they're in  We win, win, win  You better watch out, or the insects will get you  You better watch out, or the insects will get you 
[00:44:00]  You better watch out  You better watch out  You better watch out  You better watch out  It was Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway. 
[00:44:30]  He was involved in a seven-car pile-up. There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly. 
[00:45:00]  A public service announcement of The Opie and Anthony Show.  I got arrested and put on probation because I set The Tonight Show on fire.  Well, thank you.  I wish I had you guys there at the time.  I had to go to court.  By the way, this was a fire put out with a cup of water by Lauren Hutton.  I don't know how much peril or danger we were in 
[00:45:30]  when a former supermodel goes,  Stand back.  Whoa!  You truly are a supermodel.  Well, I'm off to fight cap-tooth crime through the universe.  Oh, I go to court.  My own attorney, she goes,  Plead not guilty.  I'm like,  Ah!  I saw the footage.  I'm pretty sure it's me. 
[00:46:00]  Not unless there's a third arsonist in the grassy knoll.  I might be going down on this one.  And my punishment was I had to do TV commercials,  which is fucked up.  There should be one set of laws for everybody, right?  If you got arrested for arson,  you shouldn't have been able to get away with it with a TV commercial.  So, by the way, I'm glad that's how it works.  I didn't even know what the fuck it was.  I'm like, 
[00:46:30]  Hi, I'm Bobcat Colquay.  If you're ever on a talk show,  don't set it on fire.  Ah!  Back to you, McGruff.  And here's your old friend, Kelsey Grammer,  with some safe driving tips.  I'm still trying to figure out  what the fuck Rosie O'Donnell and Penny Marshall  did to a Kmart they had to work off. 
[00:47:00]  But they better hurry.  I was at an airport.  This is a true story.  You're going,  Wow, there's an untapped comedy bonanza.  We never heard a comic talk about airports.  But I was at an airport,  and this woman came up to me and said,  I don't want to insult you,  but you look like Bobcat Colquay.  I didn't have a goddamn thing to say back.  I was like,  I was at a casino. 
[00:47:30]  I was minding my own business.  This guy came up and said,  You're going to have to move.  You're blocking the fire exit.  So if there was a fire,  I wasn't going to run.  If you're flammable and have legs,  you are never blocking a fire exit.  And you can write that down  and put a dash in front of it  and put my name at the bottom.  A dash.  A dash.  That's all I wanted to be doing was dash. 
[00:48:00]  I type 101 words a minute,  but it's in my own language.  I had the AIDS test four times.  The AIDS test is very scary to get.  It doesn't matter what you've been doing.  Waiting for the results.  It's frightening.  So I don't get the regular AIDS test anymore.  I get the roundabout AIDS test.  I call my friend Brian.  I say,  Say,  Brian,  do you know anybody who has AIDS?  No.  Cool.  Because you know me. 
[00:48:30]  I was on a bus  and it was the middle of the night  and I had a box of crackers  and a can of Easy Cheese.  But it was the middle of the night  so I could not see.  I could not see how much Easy Cheese  I was applying to each cracker.  For each bite into the cracker  it was a surprise  as to how much Easy Cheese  I had applied.  Which makes me believe  they should have a glow-in-the-dark version  of Easy Cheese.  It's not like the product  has any integrity to begin with. 
[00:49:00]  If you buy a room-temperature cheese  that you squeeze out of a can,  you probably won't get mad  because it glows in the dark too.  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday  on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to thank the fine ladies 
[00:49:30]  that are wowing out there.  We greatly appreciate it.  You guys keeping this wow thing alive.  You see the wow on the back of the cars  or the wow bumper stickers  or wow written in the dirt  on the back of trucks.  That's a signal that that guy  or that lady  because some of the ladies out there  enjoy a nice set of boobs  as they're driving to work in the morning.  Flash your boobs.  It's very chic for girls  to be attracted to other girls' bodies, Opie.  They do it all the time now.  It's the in thing, right?  Oh, very in. 
[00:50:00]  See a lot more girls  walking down the street holding hands.  Yeah.  Of the teenage variety, by the way.  It's all the rage in the high schools.  Will guys ever get to the point  where they're comfortable enough  in their relationship  and their sexuality  where they can walk hand in hand  down the street as buddies,  pals?  No, I don't think so.  Friends?  Mm-mm.  Maybe you're going to lunch  with young Ben  and you're crossing the street  and you just grab his hand.  Help him out.  Couldn't be any worse  than holding his hair.  And they do that 
[00:50:30]  in the Middle East, by the way.  They walk holding hands.  The guys hold hands  in the Middle East  and they kiss on the cheek.  What is up with that?  Thank you, man.  It's a homoerotic shithole.  They hold hands.  I was over there.  Oh, you saw this live, right?  Oh, yeah.  Were you over there?  In Kuwait and the airport,  they're all walking around  and they're holding hands  and I've seen dignitaries doing it.  Don't they have young boys, too?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This whole thing about...  We did a whole show on this.  What was the name of the young boys?  Yeah, they have a name for them.  There was a weird name for them.  And they're married  to these women  who are just like objects. 
[00:51:00]  They're nothing over there.  Wrap them up.  They have sex with them  to have kids  and keep their name going  and their bloodline going.  But they also have  these young boys  that they go out with  and sometimes have sex with.  I mean, what kind of culture is this?  They just don't like women.  Fantastic one.  Fantastic.  They cover their women up  and they're holding  other guys' hands.  Wrap them up.  It's just an animal nation.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  We interrupt this program  for the ozone midget sighting  of the day.  We go to Des Moines, Iowa.  I thought they fixed this problem.  And what problem?  The midget problem.  Like with screenings of pregnancy?  You could rip them right out now.  Yeah, but most of these midgets  were born like 20, 30 years ago  when the problem wasn't fixed.  Is that it?  Yeah.  How long do they live?  You're talking like Hitler.  I thought we fixed this problem,  meaning I thought we gathered  them all up at this point.  There have been advancements 
[00:52:00]  in medicine.  I sent them all to the  Oompa Loompa factory.  What is wrong with you?  You could look into the womb  and take tests  and determine if your kid's  going to be effed up  and in one way be a midget.  And you can yank them out now.  I believe on one level  they have fixed that problem,  but what about all the people  that are already walking  the earth with this affliction?  How long do they live?  They can live a long time.  Billy, what, Barty, Billy Barty?  Is he still alive?  I think he finally died,  but he lived like 
[00:52:30]  into his 70s or so, right?  So will we ever have a time  on this planet  or at least in this country  where we just will not  see midgets anymore?  Are they a thing of the past?  Because I remember growing up  I saw a lot more midgets.  Saw a lot more midgets as a kid  than I do now.  So I think we're getting  to the point where we might be,  you know, getting rid  of some of these things.  I think with sonograms,  like you said,  eventually once you can tell  that it's going to be that,  like you're going to notice  the only people  who actually wind up  having the midget baby  are women who live 
[00:53:00]  in ranch house style homes.  Anyway, let's say hi  to Mike in Des Moines, Iowa.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  Let's go.  Oh, yeah.  I was in this casino here  in Des Moines last night  and they had this midget in there, man.  It was funny as hell watching him.  And I was sitting there drinking  watching him trying to play.  He kept running around  trying to go to those  big machines, you know,  the real tall ones.  Yeah.  And he had to crawl up  on that little stool  and put his money in. 
[00:53:30]  Crawl up.  And then he'd crawl back down  and walk around the side  and pull the handle.  Were people putting coins  in his mouth  and pulling his arm  thinking he was just  a clever slot machine?  Oh, he hit the jackpot  on the one.  He hit the jackpot.  Man, he leaped off  that stool.  I said,  you're getting drunk  watching this, man.  It was funny as hell.  He has to jump up  and grab the lever  with two hands  and he's hanging there.  Wow, jackpot.  He couldn't even pull 
[00:54:00]  the top of the lever.  He had to pull it  from the side.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  He pops his head  out of a big pile of change  on the floor  that he just won.  Hey, can I get  some help over here?  Oh, it was fucked up, man.  A midget in a casino.  I don't know why  that makes me giggle  every morning.  The midget sighting  of the day.  Climbing up on the stool,  putting the coin in  and then having to  climb down  and pull the handle.  It's so bad, man.  It's like a set  of monkey bars for him. 
[00:54:30]  You guys got to calm down  with the midget sightings,  though.  We want to spread these out.  We have one more  for today, I guess.  Danny from Arizona.  What's up, Danny?  Hey, dude.  Hey, make it fast.  Let's go.  My doctor's a midget.  I pulled his name  out of our company book  and I need to go  and get my prostate examined.  Oh, my God.  I got cancer in my family.  So I'm sitting there  waiting for him  to walk in on a chair  and he walks in  where eye to eye  to each other.  I'm 6'3".  He sits down 
[00:55:00]  in that little spin sole  and his feet are dangling  and not even touching  the ground.  I'm doing all I can  to stop him losing it.  Oh.  So I draw out my drawers  and he puts on  a little rubber glove,  little air pockets  in the tips of his fingers  and proceeds to examine  my prostate.  I'm biting my lip  because I want to start  cracking up.  His finger's about the size  of a little pre-packaged carrot.  And I'm sitting there  and I'm thinking to myself, 
[00:55:30]  this guy can't even  reach my prostate.  How the hell are you?  Yeah.  Those little fingers  aren't long enough.  I know.  So I walked out  and I was thinking...  That's a hot story.  That was a waste of day.  Oh, that's hilarious.  When he walked in,  was he kicking  his stethoscope?  No, I still go to him.  I bring my kids  so we can get a good laugh.  You just want to pick him up.  You just want to pick him up.  That's what every midget  wants to hear.  Yeah, he is cute though, man.  All right, Danny. 
[00:56:00]  All right, later.  Midget doctor.  There you go.  Danny from Arizona.  And that concludes  today's Ozone Midget Sighting.  Yeah.  Midget doctor.  That's hilarious.  Must have been very tough  for him working his way  through school.  CJ has some info on...  There's Markham absent.  ...on the...  Here you go, jack off.  ...the boy hand-holding thing,  Anthony.  Yeah?  CJ.  Yes.  Go ahead.  Hey, I was a boy over there  about a year ago  and we went to Kuwait City Mall  and we saw the guys  walking around with the 
[00:56:30]  other guys holding hands  and kissing on the cheek  but we also saw  like guys walking around  holding boys' hands,  multiple boys  and the worst thing I saw  is when we went to  McDonald's in Kuwait City  there was a guy there  he had to have like  13 or 14 boys  looked like a Kuwaiti  whorehouse.  It was nuts.  But even worse than that  the way they treat  the women over there  I mean just  I guess they like boys  a lot more than women  because they had  the women  say if there was  two men riding  in a pickup truck  and there was a quad cab 
[00:57:00]  they had the women  riding the back of the truck  regardless of how cold  or rainy it was.  There you go.  It's like a whole nation  of Steve Seas over there.  Yeah and they sit  when they pee too.  I don't get that.  What the guys  sit when they take a leak?  Yeah they do.  You'll see them like  out in the middle of the desert  just sitting there squatting  and you think they're like  I don't know  sitting in meditation  or something like that  but they're actually  taking a piss  because they're afraid  they're going to get it  all over their clothes  or something.  Yeah they wear that dress.  Oh they're a dress.  Yeah oh yeah.  Kuwait's awful isn't it dude?  Aren't they just awful people  in Kuwait? 
[00:57:30]  They're really terrible people  and you have to make sure  that you shake  with your right hand  if you shake their  little nasty hands at all.  Why do they really  wipe with that hand  or something?  Yes they do.  You go into those  the porta potties  I swear to God  there's like hand prints  of shit all over the walls.  Yeah.  Wait you're not kidding?  I swear to God I'm not.  So what they wipe  with their hand  and then just wash it  off in the sink  and some just wipe it  on the wall?  Yes you could have  as much paper  and wet wipes  and everything  in those stalls 
[00:58:00]  and they don't care.  They'll wipe it  with their hand  and then they'll  just wash their hands.  It's something  about their religion  but the peeing  when they sit things  because if they get  it all over their clothes  they can't pray that day.  Oh my God.  Oh yeah it's nasty.  Was there just  everyone reeking over there?  Was it just a stink fest?  Like if you look  at the rule  Kuwaitis yes  but like the rich ones  that live in the city  those guys are  you know they're  driving around  in Ferraris and stuff  they're little boys  in the side seat.  But it's yeah  they're all just 
[00:58:30]  gay pedophiles  over there?  They don't work  because they get  like a hundred thousand  a year or something  just because they're  Kuwaiti citizens  because they're so  oil rich  they don't work at all  they just get money  for living there.  For living there?  Terrible.  Terrible.  They have 16 year olds  driving around  in Ferraris  and Lamborghinis  over there.  We had some  passes over there  flashing us  the west side sign  listening to Dr. Gray.  Oh.  That's something.  I'm going to relocate  to Kuwait.  Sounds like a nice place.  That is bizarre. 
[00:59:00]  Alright CJ  thank you so much.  Hey take the music  guys.  Hey Norton you rock.  Thank you CJ.  You know what  that's what we're  fighting for over there  to defend the right to  That's why they got  taken over so fast.  Everyone in Kuwait  all these third country  nationals  they're not going to  defend the country  they don't give a shit  about them.  They don't fight  for themselves.  They just say  come on in  rape, pillage  whatever you want  to do.  That's a weird way  of life.  And then yeah  we go over there  and defend the people  and there's no outcry 
[00:59:30]  at the way the women  are treated over there.  Like you do anything  to a woman over here  it's over Johnny.  Even if you don't  if they even  allege  harassment  sexual harassment  on the job  it's a big thing  you're losing your job  you're losing money  but for some reason  over there  we go over there  and send our troops  over there  to defend it.  They're really  a nation  of awful people.  Although there's  something to be said  for the fact  when you and your boys  are going for a ride  hey bitch  get in the back  of the pickup  I want to talk  to my friend 
[01:00:00]  there is something  about that  that's attractive.  Get my young boy  up front here  and you can sit  in the back.  The svelte lad  and I want to talk  sea blocker  in an awful mask  Jesus.

[01:01:00]  Well when I  flashed him  he lost his  balance  and the entire  stack of  melons came  crashing down  on him  He was  suffocated  under two  tons of  melons  but my  melons are  still juicy  and perky  Please  wow  responsibly  A public  service  announcement  of the  Opie and  Anthony  show  And I feel  bad for my  wife I really  love her so  much and she  feels so out of  shape because  you just have  the baby and  it doesn't help  when you have a  next door neighbor  that just bought  fake tits  I mean this  lady  she shows

[01:11:00]  right people  because i i've  heard a lot of  people complaining  they have no  idea what  monster rain is  yeah a quick  thing is fine  the bit itself  is just hilarious  though because  it's like 20  minutes long  oh yeah  go ahead  well when jimmy  was a young  little child  how old  jim i lived  in edison so  i'm guessing  kindergarten first  grade kindergarten  first grade him  and a little  playmate another  little boy yes  would play uh  something called  monster rain they  would say oh  monster rain is  coming and uh  both of them  would run  underneath a 
[01:11:30]  porch uh  behind a house  and uh give  each other oral  treats  they'd suckle on  each other's uh  little boy  nubs  cute little story  you know they're  little kids what  did they know  so it was you  know the game was  called monster rain  i'll tell you what  at least we knew  that the shame that  was associated with  that because we  knew we needed an  excuse to go under  the porch  right you had to  hide you couldn't  just do this out in  the backyard somewhere  but just that we  couldn't even  acknowledge to each  other we were  going to do it  monster rain all  right let's hide 
[01:12:00]  yeah it couldn't be  like hey let's go  under the porch  it was oh monster  rain's coming quick  run under the porch  that's very shameful  oh i bet you  watched the weather  channel every day  of your childhood  you pervert  looking for the big  m over your area  oh no the big m  is coming into our  area the first one  is neighborhood to  have a doppler radar  on the roof of his  house monster rain  moving into the area  should be here for  the next three days  right get under that  porch people  actually 
[01:12:30]  so  how cute  i still remember  where the porch is  i'll go take a  picture of it  you do  yeah  wouldn't that be  fantastic  that would be  funny if you took  a picture of the  monster  so uh  this little  monster rain thing  is taking on a  life of its own  i want to play the  first one because  we have we have a  lot of uh new  listeners since we  debuted the first  monster rain song  is it uh tuesday  or wednesday opie  uh it's wednesday  i'm sorry  oh i thought maybe  it was tuesday 
[01:13:00]  we should have done  this on two for  tuesday  you're gonna play  a two for a  monster rain  two for  hey if people  could tell me what  these songs have  in common  yeah if your  favorite radio  station does  two for as they  have nothing to  offer you  absolutely nothing  two for tuesday  it's a block  party  shut up  i have grown to  hate radio  personalities  i can't listen to  the radio  they talk over  the song  it's it's  radio sucks  they're gimmicks  they're holiday  countdowns 
[01:13:30]  the christmas  thing's coming  up soon  oh the  thanksgiving  thing  oh could you  play that  uh alice's  restaurant  oh  yeah every year  radio stations play  alice's uh  restaurant  here it is people  get ready we're  gonna play it  another uh  15 minutes  they promote it  for weeks  for weeks  don't forget  thanksgiving morning  alice's restaurant  hey we're the only  station gonna give you  alice's restaurant  thanksgiving morning  the only station  play in it at  9 10  what is alice's  restaurant  alice's restaurant 
[01:14:00]  arlo guthrie  arlo guthrie song  oh  you know that one  you can get  anything you want  at alice's  restaurant  why is that a big  thing for thanksgiving  we'd play it but it's  like 30 minutes long  i have no idea why  it turned out to be  i guess because the  song it has a part  in it and it's about  thanksgiving  it's about like going  i don't know why  having thanksgiving  at alice's restaurant  does it even say  thanksgiving in the  song  i think it does  it's about i think  he's having dinner  at alice's restaurant 
[01:14:30]  i know it's about  glossy photographs  down in the  8 by 10 glossy  photographs  it's probably a  consultant's idea  an insultant  and then the  consultant came to  the station and  told him to play  my song over and  over again every  thanksgiving  shut up  radio consultants  stink  they've wrecked  this business  we got into the  vw microbe  you remember a lot  of the lyrics  you got the song  you cannot get away  from it  we don't have the  song  oh the computer 
[01:15:00]  crashed again  has it been  crashing guys  crashed yesterday  all right well  and the computer  crashed and we  couldn't get the  song played so  we'll just sit here  jacking off and  playing monster  so they took me  down to the station  oh yeah yeah  with the 8 by 10  glossy photographs  awful  you've never heard  that  we went to the  dump and  yeah went to the  dump and collected  the glossy  photographs i think  something like that  8 by 10  it just talks  for a half an hour 
[01:15:30]  it's pretty much  the original rap  song  but then the hook  is you can get  everything  anything you want  and it's a wrap  i've heard that  that uh  that line  yes walk on in  it's a wrap  all right anyway  so i've heard that  line  whenever i want a  good laugh i just  put on ray stevens  songs  well you see that  was the set up  well they call it  the streak  that was the set up  and then we would  have played a little  bit of the song  there for you  about the computer  crash so why don't  we play the first  monster rain song  and then we'll talk  a few you know 
[01:16:00]  minutes and then  we'll uh we'll play  the second  you're gonna play  the song and then  back sell it  and then front sell  the other one  sure i could do  that i don't know  who does this one  though what's  back sell it mean  well uh you know  when you play  leonard skinner at  free bird you gotta  tell everybody that  it was leonard skinner  at free bird  when they get done  they're so stupid  they didn't know that  it was leonard skinner  it's free bird  i hate the way they  talk up until like  when the music starts  and then what do you  call it they call it  hitting the post  hitting the post  yes  and they talk over  the music like like 
[01:16:30]  the music isn't part  of the song  if you listen to  your favorite dj you  realize uh they have  nothing to say  when you get those  rock dj's that go  well you just heard  aqualung by jethro  tall before that the  beatles revolution  zeppelin gave us  cashmere and tom  petty running down a  dream  it's called the  laundry list  what a list of  awful songs  and then it's like  and right after this  we'll be playing some  pink floyd us and  them  on the home of  rock and roll  idaho's home of  rock and roll

[01:20:00]  john crooks left nut  people  they just don't know  how to let it go  ted williams frozen head  ted williams frozen head  if they could get his head  and put it in the hall of fame  the line would be  a mile long  oh my god  imagine  we all make  like to think  that we're civilized  you kidding me  if they advertise  that his freaking  frozen  hall of fame  you know  uh 
[01:20:30]  mr free's head  is on display  at the  at the  baseball hall of fame  i'm there  good i saw a whole special  on that  there are a lot of  misconceptions  about the frozen head  thing and frozen body  people have this image  that you're going to have  this uh  frozen body  a frozen head  and then in the future  when they're able  to cure a disease  and mount your head  on another body  in some wacky  alternate universe  um  you're going to be fine  you'll just have  your ted williams head  yeah  but the  the head does  break apart  the body 
[01:21:00]  breaks apart  it becomes like  like frozen  barbecued beef  like really  there's really  no way  there's no way  to preserve  the body  it breaks apart  you just gave me  the heebie jeebie  isn't that awful  but they think  you know  it's going to be  so far in the future  they're going to keep  these things frozen  for so far in the future  that they could even  you know  deal with that problem  fucking head comes apart  holy shit  you ever see a fucking  head come apart  like that  monster rain

[01:34:00]  oh you haven't talked to her since  no  now you told your husband also  oh yeah  and what did he say  well he disappeared  he came back later  and a couple hours later  he had some bloody knuckles  and he said he took care of it  took care of it  did he throw his bloody gi in a dumpster  and claimed uh  that his dog was in a fight  the dog  i'm still freaked out over that story  uh 
[01:34:30]  wow  so you haven't talked to your daughter since  no  what would you like to say to her  i just can't believe that you would do something like this to me  yeah  i i've done my best to raise  a decent family  where do you think you went wrong  not enough discipline  it must have been  maybe not enough guidance  i don't know i'm there  i stayed home every day  i let my husband go to work  i stayed home with the kids  you know i don't know  you were home  but were you really there

[01:51:00]  hello everybody i'm 2010 till your fresh grows and if you love to cook like i love to cook  there's many recipes that include this beautiful shallot  let me tell you something  you really have to select them and store them right  otherwise all the beautiful properties that shallots have to so many different dishes and recipes  what they add is incredible  you'll lose it  so let's talk about selection  when selecting a shallot what you want to do simply is make sure it's firm 
[01:51:30]  it has a nice light brown color all the way around that is so important  now when you peel it only peel out the outer part that's it don't go too far in because a lot of the flavor is also in the outer skin of the shallots  now here's another key too when you bring them home don't store them in the refrigerator store them on the counter  and unlike onions regular yellow onions the shelf life of shallots is very short  you would think they last for a while but they don't  and i'm 2010 till your fresh grocer with your tip of the day

[01:54:00]  there's not much in the news  so we're just kind of making it up as we go along  we like to riff on the news anthony  but there's  i don't know  we can talk about arafat  he's in a coma  he's gonna be dead any uh  any hour now  he's hanging in there  um  madonna calls for troops  uh  she wants the troops out of iraq  not only that  she doesn't like american idol  like the quotes they get from madonna  like  like what she says  matters  to anybody  well  she wants our troops out of iraq  and she doesn't like american idol  just pretty much covering the 
[01:54:30]  the whole field  the only thing she should be saying is  guy  please stop punching me in the face  stupid  whore  and her awful husband  uh  and then we talked about  kurt shilling's sock  did we talk about  burt reynolds  and his blackmail  yeah  that's an interesting  interesting little story  he's being sued  yeah  and uh  he's suing back now  he's doing an o'reilly thing  uh  some woman is claiming that  burt reynolds  now i don't know how believable this is  um  was beating her 
[01:55:00]  of course he was  it's burt reynolds  how do you get into a relationship with burt reynolds  it's been a known fact that he's been  every woman  popping pills  and  yeah popping pills  and abusing women  every woman this guy has ever been with  i don't know ever  but  a lot of them  they all claim that he's beat them  every one of them  remember judy karn  from uh  from ronan martin's laughing  show way back in the older days  uh she was like the first one  that came out  and said that 
[01:55:30]  that burt was uh  smacking on her  and burt used to like  just  full-handed  punch her right in the face  and then other women  you know  because it's burt reynolds  they'd come on board  they'd hear the stories  who else  did he have  lonnie anderson  lonnie  lonnie anderson  and she came forward  and said yeah  was he cracking her around too  just  smacking her in the head  big kid  speed bag  workout on those big tits  and so what's the new one  sally field 
[01:56:00]  yes sally field  another one  and then she came forward  and said that burt was  did she actually come forward  and say that  every girl that that  burt's been with  all right and now  there's a new one  there's a new one  saying that uh  he's a pill popper  and he likes to  uh-huh  hit  the guy's insane  he's very angry  for some reason  and it's not even that  you know his star has fallen  because he was doing it  when he was uh  the number one box office draw  did you know that  he was the number one box office draw  in the 70s right  back in the smoky and the bandit days  yes yes yes  all right well  i'd like to go to the phones 
[01:56:30]  but the computer's still down  so i don't know what these people  want to talk about  how about we call it  potluck uh wednesdays  all right  potluck  uh-oh we're depending on the  phone screeners  why not  this could either be  really good or really bad  we don't even know  what they're gonna say  hi who's this  hey it's daniel  daniel and what do you have  for the show today  well i've got a great story  from last night  but first off  i'm glad to hear you guys  back on the air  thank you  uh... where uh... i listen uh... of course  to ron and says here in dc and they talk about you guys a lot too being back so 
[01:57:00]  yeah there are pals we love those guys and we'll work with them again someday  um... my buddy called me uh... early this morning  uh... he uh... he works up in dc and he was actually at this bar in alexandria  it was an irish pub that uh... he frequents  and uh... there's this girl that he's kind of been talking to she kind of goes there too  a lot and they've been talking for probably about the last month or so well he finally  went home with her last night  uh... and uh... uh... after they uh... after they had sex she kind of went up to go to the bathroom to 
[01:57:30]  do what girls have to do after you fuck them  and uh... he said he had a he had that like bubble coming out as a fart and when he farted  he actually shit on her sheets  oh man  and and and of course i was like well jj what did you do  he said he took the sheets he said he just he's like man i panicked  he put he balled up the sheets and put it in her closet  and he just left  and  and i said jj why did you leave the sheets why wouldn't you just take them with you 
[01:58:00]  and you know you could come up with some bullshit story later  what kind of bullshit story can you come up with if you steal her sheets and run out the door  without saying goodbye while she's in the bathroom  i saw two negroes walking by the house  but here's the here's the point they can you imagine her she walked out of her bathroom  her sheets are gone she's like where did this asshole go  she goes to her closet and in there her sheets are with shit all over them  and then she uh... uh... unfurls the sheets  and there's just a nugget 
[01:58:30]  a milk dud  i think he could have had a chance to fuck her again if he just took the sheets he could have made up some bullshit story  yeah i think he pretty much blew any chance he had of sleeping with this girl again  crack would stink  exactly  all right guys  talk to y'all later  wow  that's a weird predicament  because i kind of pride myself on being able to think on my feet  so when he's telling the story  i'm trying to come up with an excuse or something you can do really quick to remedy that problem  if that put a skid mark  if it was a firm nugget  he may have been able to just flick it off and you know have it hit the wall or something 
[01:59:00]  and not leave any telltale marks on the sheets  but if this guy like you said a bubble you know came out  it probably left something that couldn't just be readily cleaned  but i'm thinking  what he should have done  go into the kitchen  grab some water  right  spill it on the bed  and then grab a paper towel or something and start scrubbing it  and uh  and then when she comes out  go i got  i went to get something to drink  i'm a cluzz 
[01:59:30]  i spilt it all over the bed  no you just gotta take the sheets home  or maybe even something like uh  that she had that could stain  in the in the refrigerator  as a drink  and you say i went to grab some grape juice  and uh  i spilt it in your bed  i'm sorry  i'm cleaning it up now though  and just trying to scrub that nugget mark  you're thinking too much  why  you get dressed  you take the sheets  and you leave  how do you make an excuse that you took her sheets  you just leave  and you throw them in the dumpster with the bloody ghee  there's no way  and then blame it on your dog  that your dog had a problem 
[02:00:00]  yes  it wouldn't work  you couldn't see her again  dude you're forgetting that the smell  it's not like  shit doesn't smell  you can clean  sorry i spilled a little grape juice  it just happens to be a big brown  eight inch stain  that smells like feces  boy that's funny grape juice  that's the worst grape juice i ever had  alright let's continue with uh  welch's ass  what flavor is this  let's continue with the phone potluck thing here  okay  i like that story  that one worked out well  so far so good  let's see

[02:12:00]  type of woman that  would um you know  she's had the the uh  surgery done on her  she probably wants to  spruce herself up a bit  be a little outrageous  a little sexual  wood floor  wood floor  i'm saying she shaved  the whole thing off  okay  i'll agree with your  assessment  uh and the fact  that she's  very welcome  and the fact that  she goes to work  without any underpants  but i think she's a  mohawk i thought i  heard a little bit  of a difference  i was i was  hinging on that too  but i went all out 
[02:12:30]  with the uh  wood floor  i uh  i quite frankly  don't care  um  but i'm gonna do uh  wood floor myself  yes  she's right up your  alley  no she's not  she's terrific  an older woman  older gal  hey you know what  i got tickets to the  downtown the night  before thanksgiving  so there you go  what's going on there  you be the judge  all right  yeah we're gonna do  a big thing uh  thanksgiving eve  at uh  the downtown  yeah  uh it's gonna be a lot

[02:13:30]  wood floor  that would have to  be hitler mustache  yep  well okay then  that's what it is  you know i'm sure  there were those days  i'm sure there were  those days where  hitler would have  shaved one side  it was a little  uneven  and he's like  oh what do i do  and shaved a little  more on the other  side all and he's  trying to catch up  and it ended up  really small  yeah how small is  this patch  and no one made fun  of it  it's like the size  of i'm gonna say  the size the only  way to describe the  size of a quarter  maybe  that's a hitler  mustache  why do you leave  that there  that looks that  looks so ridiculous  that looks silly  when you're standing  up  what is that a post-it 
[02:14:00]  they're actually  standing up with  their legs together  it looks okay  because it's like  a little patch of  hair but when  they're laying on  their back with  their legs spread  it's like it's  like a spot like  an oil spot on  the driveway  it looks like a  upside down  exclamation point  yeah  makes no sense  there's just too  much space  between that  and that  the vag  and the hair  it's like what's  this a rest stop  to the belly button  it's not round  it's shaped  like  like a triangle

Ladies, you see the WoW in the car.  The guys, if you feel like it, would love to see you flash them. 
[02:32:30]  Simple as that.  Of course.  I believe you can get the WoW bumper stickers  by going to opieandanthony.com  and I think there's an area there  where you leave your address  and then they'll send you one WoW sticker.  One.  One.  One WoW sticker  and it should take about three or four weeks.  All right.  EverQuest 2 coming in today.  Released.  I'm getting it today.  And Halo.  Psyched.  Halo 2 today, right?  Or yesterday?  Halo 2 came out yesterday.  A hundred million dollars in its first day. 
[02:33:00]  That's like bigger than movies.  Well, that's what they were saying.  I've read a few articles on the video gaming  and they're saying it's much more profitable  than making movies now.  Huge.  So a lot of huge players are getting into the video gaming business  because the profit margin is unbelievable.  I mean, look at the Grand Theft Auto.  I know.  San Andreas is selling like crazy.  Now you've got Halo 2.  Now you've got EverQuest 2.  You've got Half-Life coming out.  Half-Life 2 coming out.  Psyched.  Remember when video games being part of it,  whether it was a voice or some other involvement,  was something you did because your star had fallen? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  They got these has-beens and stuff to do these.  Now people want to be part of these things.  There's Samuel L. Jackson is in GTA.  Mm-hmm.  It's pretty cool.  As well as your buddies, Opie and Anthony,  for 30 seconds each.  For 30 seconds.  We have a little cameo.  We got involved late in the game.  Hopefully on the next one we'll have a bigger part.  Well, thanks to Infinity Broadcasting,  we weren't really allowed to do anything.  No.  And as soon as our contract ran out,  they called us immediately, 
[02:34:00]  but it was a little late in the process.  They kind of fit us in at the end there,  but I'm psyched to just have my name in the credits.  Yeah, they threw us a bone.  How cool is that?  They threw us a bone.  I don't know what's going on with the phones.  Can we update the phone list?  Now they're writing down names  and what people want to talk about.  Oh, they're writing them down.  We have all this computer equipment,  and there's a piece of paper in front of Opie with line one.  Yeah, well, all right.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Just put the names up on the screen. 
[02:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Fantastic.  All right.  This could be a quickie.  Yes.  John in the city.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hello.  Big fan of yours.  Thanks, John.  What are we?  Chopped liver?  Yeah, what about the Opie, Anthony and Opie?  Yeah, we gave birth to this animal.  Nothing?  You guys are fantastic.  They really are responsible for this rottenness you hear.  I've been listening to you since any W.  Oh.  Question for you, Norton. 
[02:35:00]  Sure.  Looking at some escort services, what does GFE stand for?  You silly goose.  Girlfriend experience.  That implies that there's going to be kissing or some type of intimacy, some type of...  Hand-holding.  Maybe.  Hand-holding.  Hand-holding my cock.  Maybe some BBBJ, which is a bareback blowjob.  Oh, that's without a condom.  Yes.  What site do you recommend?  Well, I would personally, if I was looking like I was last night until one in the morning,  sweating and masturbating, I would say Craigslist. 
[02:35:30]  Like a chimpanzee.  I was disgusted.  I couldn't find a hooker to come over.  You don't understand.  How do you not find a hooker?  Well, one for the price I wanted.  I'm sick of spending too much money.  So are you starting to downgrade your...  Starting.  That's why I'm on Craigslist.  You go to Erosguide, it's $300 a pop.  Craigslist, you can find someone with a drug habit.  What's that?  How much are you looking for?  The cent.  Sometimes you want to spend a buck, buck fifty.  Well, then you get somebody with, like, braces on her feet for a buck fifty.  I don't care if she has braces on her legs. 
[02:36:00]  As long as she shows up and does a good job, her and her MS legs can come in.  You know, old turnip root legs can fall on the floor and perform oral sex.  They do that embarrassing, pretend not you're looking at her.  Pretend not you're looking at her.  Good improv skills, Shakespeare.  Pretend not you're looking at her.  Oh, I'm really a fraud.  Listen.  Yes, sir.  One more thing that I wanted to ask you.  Didn't get me?  Oh, uh-huh.  You did say, huh.  That was Anthony.  That was me, I went, uh-huh.  Oh, all right.  I don't fall for that malarkey. 
[02:36:30]  All right, anything else in the news?  We've covered all the news items today, right?  Pretty much.  I think so.  It's just a slow news day.  There's something frightening I found yesterday.  I'll cover it quickly.  Okay.  There is the National Transportation Safety Board.  You know, they investigate all the crashes and stuff.  They want black box recorders in all new vehicles manufactured in the United States.  Now, this would be braking, accelerating, hard cornering, if your seatbelt's on, airbag deployment, things like that. 
[02:37:00]  And I read this, and a lot of privacy experts are now saying, wait a minute, I don't like this.  And then I'm reading further.  These black box recorders have been fitted into every General Motors car in its 2004 line.  It's already in these cars.  I own one.  I'm reading this last night thinking, I don't think I want this.  They're saying that a lot of these have already been used to determine guilt in criminal and civil cases across the country.  You're driving your car. 
[02:37:30]  You say, well, you know, I jammed on the brakes, but I guess it wasn't in time, or this person ran out in front of me.  I hit them, injured them.  They can now check this black box and see if you did indeed apply the brakes, or if you were cornering too fast, how fast you were going at the time.  And it could be used against you in court, and a lot of the people driving around, me included, until last night, I didn't even know this thing was in here.  But if you're not doing anything wrong, why would you care?  Well, I hate that argument.  I just don't want people taking a peek into my life at all. 
[02:38:00]  I don't know.  You shouldn't have to have this in your car, is what I'm saying.  But at the worst, it shouldn't be.  And it shouldn't be put in, and you're uninformed.  Yeah, you should be told that that's.  There's no law that says that they have to even tell you this is in your car.  You're both right.  Here's why I say if you're not doing anything wrong, I don't want the government poking the nose in my life.  But if you're in court, or there's some type of a criminal charge, and there's something in your car that can prove you were telling the truth,  I mean, that could also work in your favor of you going, no, no, that guy sped, and I hit the brakes. 
[02:38:30]  The other guy goes, he plowed right through the stop sign.  Then it says, no, no, no.  So it could work both ways.  Yeah, yeah.  But if you're in a civil or criminal case, I mean, whatever they can use, they can use it.  I just don't want it to be used to track for speeding or where you've been.  Well, that's the point.  Yeah, but they can't have it both ways there.  With technology, I think we're getting a lot more of our, I don't know, a lot of our privacy taken away.  It looks good on the outside, like the thing you brought up, to prove your innocence.  That's great.  That's a great convenience. 
[02:39:00]  It would help you out.  Easy Pass is a great convenience, so you don't have to wait at the toll booths.  All the security cameras around the city are great.  But the Easy Pass thing is being used in divorce cases as well.  Right, people are saying, where have you been?  And they're looking and seeing what Easy Pass toll booths you went through.  And they have a printout of where you're going, what time you went through it.  And again, if you're not doing anything wrong kind of thing.  But it's just more government in your life and kind of on to what you're doing, where you are. 
[02:39:30]  Everyone has the cell phones now that can be locators.  You know, if you call 911 and you're injured, they can locate where you are by your cell phone.  Sounds good.  And again, this could help you out in an emergency.  But it's kind of creepy.  And I don't even have a good reason for it.  I'm not like, I don't like it because.  You know, like you said, if you're not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't worry about it.  But there's just something creepy about there being so much knowledge out there as to what you're doing, where you are, how fast you're going, what time you're leaving, where you're walking, where you're banking. 
[02:40:00]  You know, there's just...  It comes down to how much you trust the government, I think, because it sounds like all well and good, but we all have that paranoia about the government in the back of our heads.  It's like, when does all this technology turn against us?  Right, in some bad science fiction movie.  Like 1984 or something.  Yeah, it turns and all of a sudden it's just used against you.  I think that's what it comes down to.  Like, yeah, sure, we're not doing anything wrong, but you're just wondering.  It's presented to us as a convenience, as a great convenience. 
[02:40:30]  Easy Pass is a great convenience.  But there are these side effects of it that make you think, wow, you know, they do know how fast I'm going between when I get on the parkway and when I'm exiting.  Based on the Easy Pass, they absolutely know what my average speed was.  And they can now do the math very easily, and then all of a sudden they just pass law like, you know what, everyone that's speeding through the Easy Pass lane, not even through the Easy Pass lanes, but speeding on the highway, we're just going to start mailing you tickets. 
[02:41:00]  We're going to start mailing you tickets.  And what people can do, by the way, if you're cheating, is they give you a pouch with the Easy Pass.  You can slip your Easy Pass into it.  It doesn't register.  So that little pouch you get, if you're cheating and you don't want to get caught with your Easy Pass, well, use your head and just pay for the toll when you're going somewhere you shouldn't be.  You don't have to.  Oh, yeah, there's a pouch that comes with it.  There's a little metallic, like a Mylar thing.  Absolutely.  And look, technically.  Well, that makes me feel a little better.  I had no idea because I pretty much don't drive my car anymore.  Most people don't think that, though.  Well, their argument is that, like, well, they could track you with speeding, which I don't want because I speed. 
[02:41:30]  But technically, you know what I'm saying?  It's like it's a law.  They're saying we can track you doing something illegal.  Well, if you're not doing anything illegal, and I'm not playing devil's advocate because I don't want to get caught speeding either.  Yeah, but the illegal speeding thing is so stupid because, you know, they have these speed limits down to a level so they can catch you.  And so they can.  It's a revenue stream, man.  That's all it is.  Still, I can't believe there's still highways where you can only drive 55 miles an hour.  That's ridiculous.  Stop it.  And the only reason is so they could, you know, pull you over and make money.  That's it.  I agree with that.  Most people could easily drive 70 miles an hour on most of these highways without a problem. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, the cars are safer.  They can handle speeds a lot better.  But that's what it's all about.  And you get something like OnStar.  You know, the General Motors cars have OnStar.  Another thing that's very convenient, you hit that button.  And one time I hit it, we wanted to know where a Denny's was.  And they're like, all right, you go down the road, I'll feed the directions to you.  And it's very convenient.  But it was kind of creepy hitting it and setting up the OnStar.  And they're going, okay, so right now you're northbound on 95 by exit. 
[02:42:30]  And you're like, you know exactly where I am.  That's great.  It really is cool.  If you're broken down or something, you can just call and go over.  Oh, yeah, you just hit the button and they know where you are.  They send somebody to come and help you.  They can just unlock your doors, too.  But the thought that they know where you are and that information,  who knows where it could go in the future, under what circumstances.  Again, I'm not a criminal, so show me where the Denny's is and I'm fine.  But that's the point I'm trying to make here is, yeah, 
[02:43:00]  what is it going to be used for in the future that we don't know about?  If down the line your political ideology makes you some kind of criminal of the state,  there's going to be these things that are built into just basic daily activities.  That are going to make it very hard for people to kind of defend their freedoms and their privacy.  But with every technology, there comes that fear that it's going to be used.  Like if you go back, I'm not saying it never is, but look at the phone.  There may have been people when people first started talking on the phone that said, 
[02:43:30]  well, now the government's going to know when you and I have spoken.  There's always a backlash from technology.  And they have used it for criminal investigations.  Criminal investigations, yeah.  Bugging and, you know, is it really that criminal?  No, they bugged, you know, John Lennon's phone.  Just because something can be perverted, like that's like saying, well, we have jails,  but because the criminal system can be perverted, we shouldn't have jails  because innocent people are going to go to jail.  Of course you have to have jails.  That's sick that they bugged them.  And believe me, I'm playing devil's advocate too  because I don't want to come off sounding like that nut from yesterday, 
[02:44:00]  all paranoid about the government.  I talked to him, by the way, online.  We emailed.  You did?  I like him now.  How do you spell fucking scumbag, spell?  I wanted to get it out so fast.  Eager to plead.  That's all right.  You're Swedish.  How do you spell?  How does man spell pork soccer?  You were so sexy in trading places.  Oh, shut up.  You should have brought that conversation in.  You should have brought that conversation in.  No, no, no.  We didn't IM.  We emailed back and forth.  He was sending me some stuff.  Oh, all right.  And it was actually, I like him now. 
[02:44:30]  I still like what he said, but yeah, he sent me some interesting stuff.  What?  Monster Rain coming.  All right.  Well, Anthony, we've got a lot of people on the phones that want to talk about this.  Oh, really?  I think.  Let's track them.  All right.  Hi, who's this?  I'm sure we do.  Hello.  Danny.  Hey, Danny.  What do you have for the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, is Anthony's on start?  Is it telling which driveways to drive over and front yards and mailboxes to knock over  to get to the quickest Denny's?  Yeah, yeah.  My navigation system lets me know by the way I drive.  Median strips on the Belt Parkway are included. 
[02:45:00]  One way down the one-way streets, the wrong way.  Right.  That's too funny.  Hey, I wanted to ask that.  I wanted to tell Jimmy Norton.  My girlfriend squirts, too, man.  The first time, it was like our first date.  I went out and spent $100 on a nice pair of pants.  And we're kind of like going at it.  She's like humping my leg.  And she goes, oh, we've got to stop.  I'm like, no, no, keep going.  And the next thing I know, my pants are soaked, my shoes.  Money well, Spencer.  How hot is that? 
[02:45:30]  Her body can't deny how turned on she is.  How sexy is that?  See, we try to do like a above-the-table break, but we don't know what these guys want to  talk about.  No, we don't.  So look, we get thrown right back in the gutter.  That's all right.  But it's still a good story.  Thank you, buddy.  It's a fine story.  I want to comment to Spencer from New York City.  He says, then don't get and sign up for fucking E-ZPass.  Yes, good point.  You have a fucking choice, idiots.  No, no, no.  Let me comment.  We can talk about New York City and the surrounding area.  You don't really have a choice anymore. 
[02:46:00]  You don't have a choice.  They're making it very, very hard for you not to have it.  As they should.  It's okay.  Don't sign up for it.  I'm not going to sit there in a half-hour line.  Because they don't have enough.  To pay cash.  Yeah, they don't have enough tollboots dedicated to cash anymore.  Yeah.  Because they want everyone to just get E-ZPass.  They have too many.  That's their initial goal is everyone has E-ZPass.  Right.  There shouldn't be gates at the tolls.  There shouldn't be anything.  It should be set up that you're just driving down the highway like you're normally driving.  But you don't really have a choice. 
[02:46:30]  You don't have a choice, especially in New York.  It would take you hours to get somewhere that takes you minutes if you didn't have E-ZPass.  It's not.  Yeah, you do have a choice.  I could get it or not get it.  But it's too convenient to have.  That's what I said.  People have presented things as a huge convenience.  And you realize that there's these little side issues that later may bite you in the ass.  That's what I'm saying.  It is like there's nothing that makes me happier than when I'm driving and I see all those people in the cash lane.  Oh, and you're driving right by. 
[02:47:00]  I'm waving.  It's phenomenal.  Oh, I love it.  You wave.  Hi.  You want to track me?  You put E-ZPass trackers down by the meatpacking district and watch me look at trannies.  I don't care.  I'm there.  My life stinks.  You can track it if you want.  Do you see all the people that are going through the toilet booth?  And I don't pay my taxes.  Wait, that won't come back to haunt me.  That was an ass.  Idiot to say that on the radio.  You see the people that go through the E-ZPass lane, especially in Jersey, because in New York they have the stupid gates that come down.  You've got to wait for them to go up.  In Jersey there's no gates. 
[02:47:30]  There's a little light that says E-ZPass and it's green or it says call E-ZPass in red if it didn't register.  They pull up and stop and wait for that light.  I like flying through there at about 30, you know?  And you get people in front of you.  They feel like they have to wait for that light to come on.  If the green light doesn't come on, there's going to be an OJ chase behind them to try to arrest them for not registering.  No, they just mail a ticket to you.  They mail a thing that says...  No, that's what happened to me and it drove me nuts. 
[02:48:00]  Well, you didn't have E-ZPass.  No, I didn't.  So you probably...  No, I know.  It's another thing, though.  It's like, you know, the 35-cent toll on the Jersey turnpike.  Parkway.  Parkway, thank you.  I don't know.  I'm a Long Island guy.  So I threw my change into the basket and it turned green.  And I went.  Yeah.  That's what I thought, anyway.  I get a ticket in the mail for $25.35 because I...  Wait, it was a 35-cent toll.  And a $25 service charge or office fee type of thing. 
[02:48:30]  For them to take 35 cents?  Yeah.  It costs $25.  That's why the government's broke.  This happened twice.  On the way to see my brother and his new baby.  And on the way back from seeing my brother and his new baby.  So I get in the mail.  It has my license plate.  It took my picture.  And it says you owe $25.35.  For what?  They're claiming that I'm blowing off 35-cent tolls.  I'll bet you are.  No.  I've gone out to lunch with you.  I bet you are.  Oh, dude.  Relax with that.  You want to see my... 
[02:49:00]  I'm bringing in my American Express bill because I'm not going to take the cheap wrap anymore.  I'm buying dinner.  Bring in your bill.  I'm buying dinner and lunch for everybody on this show these days.  Really?  I'm not...  And breakfast.  Yeah.  It's getting ridiculous.  Bring in the Amex bill.  You want me to?  We'll take a look.  No problem.  I'd like to see that.  I'd like to see that.  No problem.  So, yeah.  So they got me for $25.35.  I'm like...  So I call them up.  I'm like, I'm not blowing off 35-cent tolls.  Yeah.  Why would you blow off a 35-cent toll? 
[02:49:30]  No.  You think you're going to get away with it?  And of course, there's going to be some ridiculous fee if you blow it off.  So then I pay that one.  And then another one comes in the mail.  And I call them up screaming and yelling.  I'm like, what are you doing?  I paid this.  Because it wasn't even worth arguing over, really.  So I just paid it.  But then I got another one.  They're like, no.  You blew it off twice in one day.  And then I lost it.  Then I lost it.  So then you know what they do?  They're like, all right.  Calm down.  Calm down.  We are getting a lot of complaints at this particular toll plaza.  I guess it's not obvious what you have to do or something.  I didn't pay any of them.  So she goes, calm down. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  You paid the first one.  We'll let you off.  She's letting me off the hook.  We'll let you off the hook on the second one.  But know what she says?  You still have to pay the 35-cent toll.  I said, no, I paid it.  No.  No, they got me breaking the law.  So it was $25.35.  So we'll take off the office fee charge or whatever.  But you still have to pay the toll.  I'm like, you're kidding me.  Why don't you take the 35 cents out from the other one that I just paid you?  Yeah, the other one that I wasn't supposed to pay.  I had to make a check out for 35 cents. 
[02:50:30]  Great.  How stupid is that?  You know, it costs them more to cash that 35-cent check than 35 cents.  Like, you got the computer there.  Just, you know, wipe it out.  I don't know how you survive without EasyPass.  I'm not driving anymore.  Oh, I don't live in it either.  I don't understand.  Well, when you drive, you're driving like long distances, though.  No, man.  You drive up to Boston every so often, or you drive to Philly.  Since we started this job, I've been in my car three times. 
[02:51:00]  It's just sitting.  To me, it's worth it.  It's just sitting right now.  I live in the city full time.  I go out to the island every once in a while to see family, and that's it.  EasyPass don't cost you anything.  But I'm not.  I take the 59th Street Bridge over.  This means nothing to anyone else in the country.  Well, just because it's the easiest way to get in for me.  The free bridge and where I live and all that.  So, whatever.  It's the worst, though.  There's nothing worse than sitting in an Oap's truck, and you see everybody whizzing by.  Whizzing by.  And you two are sitting there like two old ladies.  Like, dude, are you going to get EasyPass?  He's like, no, I know. 
[02:51:30]  I just don't drive that much.  Jockeying for position.  It's worth it if you drive once and have to see if that guy does.  You're right.  Well, we do have to take the ride to Boston or down to Philly or Washington.  You're right.  But it's kind of rare these days.  What does Boston call it?  What does Mass call it?  Fast Lane.  Fast Lane.  Fast Lane.  But you can go flying through.  EasyPass sucks.  EasyPass sucks.  They camped that up there in Boston.  Dude, you can go flying through the Boston ones on the floor.  I know.  That I like.  Jersey's another one.  They got the one.  And now the newest ones are just this big thing.  It looks like the things they hang the big signs on. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  It has the sensors on it.  You could fly through there, and there's still jerk-offs that slow down.  Yes, Steve?  Just go.  Big Kev's on line 11.  He's got an interesting trick on how to beat the New Jersey Parkway tolls.  I did hear this one.  What does he do?  He plays silly songs from freaking Broadway shows?  Close.  Close.  Distracting the toll takers?  Right.  Eric and I witnessed this on the way back from Boston, actually.  It's, I mean, to jip the Parkway at a 35 cent seems like an awful lot of effort, but.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Well.  What song does he have?  The Parkway is for tolls.  The Parkway is for tolls.  The Parkway is for tolls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Big Kev.  Kev.  That was Eric, not me.  Now, how do you beat these tolls?  There's a, if you get it, when New Jersey first instituted the cameras on the tolls.  Yeah, they take a picture of your license plate.  Right.  Well, they can't do it anymore in the exact change lanes because you can, when you go to  court, you have to confront your accuser. 
[02:53:00]  Uh-huh.  And that would be a machine.  And they can't produce the machine, so therefore your case is dismissed.  So you go through the exact change lane.  Right.  And you don't pay.  I don't pay.  I've never paid a New Jersey toll in my life.  But you have to go to court a lot.  No, he's saying they can't put the cameras there anymore.  They stop taking the pictures in the exact change lanes.  They only do it in EasyPass lanes.  I got you.  Because when you sign up for EasyPass, you sign away that loophole in the law. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, all right.  Hey, look at you saving 35 cents.  35 cents.  By the way, Florentine used to do that.  He would pull up and just fake like he was throwing.  Why would he fake it?  Dude, it was the worst acting I've ever seen.  You should have seen Peter O. Florentine driving down the highway.  Fake throwing quarters.  Oh, he would roll the window down.  His hand would come out.  And my friend Kenny used to deliver newspapers.  And Kev, you may know this trick.  He knew how to get out of the turnpike tolls, which can add up, where he would jump off like exit 8A. 
[02:54:00]  And there's another one where you can just go into the rest area and sneak out the back behind a fence.  Really?  Yeah.  Back by where the truckers are getting their blowjob.  Yeah, and where the lot lizards are, my friend Kenny is driving with a stupid car full of newspapers, sneaking out of an 80-cent toll.  Shisler psychopath.  80 cents.  All right, Big Kev.  Thank you.  Go through the exact change lane.  There you go.  But see, they count on people paying the toll.  Yeah.  They count on people not going through the bother of going to court to try to fight this stuff. 
[02:54:30]  So, you know, they're making their money with the $25 freaking office fee and all that.  And the reason you have any stupid tolls there is because of the unions.  Because they would fire all of them and just go, look, beat it.  But, hey, you've got to have a certain amount of people there for the unions.  You could have a monkey taking the tolls.  They do.  Why are you screaming for that?  And just put, I don't know.  If everyone had the easy pass, you wouldn't need the personnel there.  It would be a lot cheaper. 
[02:55:00]  Rip down the toll boots.  Rip down the toll boots, Jimmy.  I didn't mean to use it.  Sorry.  Your inside voice, Jimmy.  Use your inside voice today.  Use your Monster Rain under the porch voice.  Oh, let's play this.  They should just put it.  Shut up with that.  I'm working on that every day.  I know.  I'm working on it.  I now say the word place.  What did you used to say?  Uh, boy.  Oh, I thought you said place.  The listeners want to move on for that stupid bit.  It's not a bit.  It's just how I talk.  Let's play a mashup.  Get out of here. 
[02:55:30]  And, um, we got the Orson Welles thing, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And now that we had a nice, normal radio break, now we can go back in the gutter.  Of course we can.  And we can play some tracks from the Silence of the Lambs musical.  Now, what the hell is this?  Well, I'll tell you next.  It's not a tease.  We just got to take a break.  But it's entertaining.  Isn't it a tease by proxy?  Yeah, I guess.  Yes, it is.  But there's a song here that mentions the C word.  Just want to warn the women out there. 
[02:56:00]  Hello.  They don't like that word.  C word.  C word.  The C word will be heard next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  That means, Mom, time to turn on your country station.  Mm-hmm.  Time to go to top hits.  Now, my mom goes to Channel 10 when we get dirty.  Oh, really?  She likes Channel 10.  Which one's that?  On the old XM.  One of the, I think it's called America or something like that.  Oh.  Good old-fashioned country music.  Johnny Cash and the gang.  Country music.  So, Mom, time to go to 10.  But first, we got a little mashup. 
[02:56:30]  I think this is Eminem and Paul McCartney doing a little thing here.  Uh-huh.  No?  Say.  No?  Say.  Hold on.  Say.  Do this and that and this.  Let's hope this one turns out pretty darn good, huh?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend.  Guess who's back?  Back again.  Shady's back.  Tell a friend. 
[02:57:00]  I've created a monster.  If nobody wants to see more, someone more, they want Shady.  I'm shocked.  Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you.  A little bit of weed, mix with some heart.  They got some vodka, let them jumpstart.  My heart forgets in the shock.  When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor, when I'm not cooperating.  But I'm rocking the table while he's operating.  You waited this long to stop debating.  Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag, inovulating.  I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney.  But your husband's heart problem's complicating.  So the FCC won't let me be, or let me be me.  So let me see.  They try to shut me down on MTV. 
[02:57:30]  But it feels so empty without me.  So come on and dip.  Bow on your lips.  Talk back.  Come on your lips.  Come on your tips and get ready.  Cause this shit's about to get heavy.  I just settled on my law.  So fuck you, Debbie.  Now this is the stuff, the job for me.  So everybody doesn't follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so empty without me.  I said, this looks like a talk to me.  So everybody just follow me.  Cause we need a little controversy.  Cause it feels so empty without me.  Little hell yeah.  Kids feeling rebellious.  Embarrassed.  The parents still listen to Elvis.  They start feeling like prisoners helpless. 
[02:58:00]  Then someone comes along on a mission and yells,  BICK!  A visionary.  Vision is scary.  Can start a revolution.  Polluting the airwaves to revel.  So just let me revel in asking the fact that I got everyone kissing my dad.  It's a disaster, such a catastrophe for you to see.  So damn, what's up my ass?  You ask for me?  Well, I'm back.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Fix your minutes and a fool.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  I'm in a inner inner inner front of your skin like a splinter.  The center of attention.  Back for the winter.  I'm in a resting.  The best things.  Infesting.  Infesting.  In your kids.  Here's a nesting.  Festing.  Attention, please.  Feel the tension.  Soon as someone mentions me. 
[02:58:30]  Here's my ten cents.  My two cents is free.  A nuisance.  Two cents.  You sent for me.  Now this is a fight on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little controversy,  there's no interest without me.  I say this is a fight on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little controversy,  there's no interest without me.  Love doesn't come in a minute.  Sometimes it doesn't come at all.  I only know that when I'm in it, 
[02:59:00]  it isn't silly.  Love isn't silly.  Love isn't silly at all.  Love isn't silly.  Yeah.  This is a fight on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little controversy,  there's no interest without me.  I say this is a fight on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little controversy,  there's no interest without me.  I say this is a fight on top of me.  So everybody, just follow me.  If we need a little controversy, 
[02:59:30]  there's no interest without me.  I say this is a fight on top of me.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are still juicy and perky. 
[03:00:00]  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Really is a different between white women and black women.  And I've dated both.  Yes, I have.  Black women get on your right.  What?  Yeah, see, already.  Right on.  Ain't gonna give me no pussy, but right on. 
[03:00:30]  Right on, motherfucker.  Beg me.  Already, you've not had no pussy, you gotta fuck a white woman.  Now, fuck you, I'm gonna fuck you.  But white women take more shit.  Like, you be at home, you know, and shit.  You get ready to go out, and you say, I'm going out, baby.  Take it easy.  You say that to a black woman, the bitch starts dressing too. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, nigga, me too.  Shit, what the fuck?  Yeah, you's a lying, motherfucker.  You think you're going out without me?  And they get that hair to move.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Yeah, you right.  Yeah, just try to do something mean.  Bitch, I'm trying to knock you down.

[03:02:30]  But you promised.  You say, if I wait two months, fuck hard.  Just try it.  Shit.  Don't matter.  Just don't bite.  White woman, give it up so sweet.  You know, they give it up so sweet.  No, no, no.  You suck all that pussy shit.  They lick their fingers and shit.  Black woman, you be sucking their dick.  Wait, nigga.  What's shit?  A little more to the left, motherfucker. 
[03:03:00]  You don't suck them, motherfucker.  Get down.  Get down.  And you can fuck white woman if they don't come.  They say, it's all right.  I'll just lay here and use a vibrator. 
[03:03:30]  Black woman, talk about your hair.  I'll tell you.  Well, nigga, that's some side dick.  Is that it?  No, you got to grind in my pussy.  Oh, nigga, fuck me, shit.  I'm putting my legs down, motherfucker.  Bro, you said pussy, not stomach.  Because niggas try to hurt a pussy boy. 
[03:04:00]  Niggas act like pussy is the last thing they ever going to get.  When they be fucking, yeah, motherfucker.  Let's burn this motherfucker down.  Here we go.  Now.  Would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  No, I'm not going to.  Damn it.  Oh, kill yourself.  Oops.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  That sweeper is not accurate.  She falls down too fast. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  That bothers me every time I hear that.  I know.  I've thought the same thing.  There needs to be a slight pause before she hits the ground.  A little delay.  I like when our sweepers are accurate, Anthony.  Yeah.  We have Rich Voss.  Did he hang up?  No?  No.  Okay.  Rich Voss wants to check in real fast.  Hey, Voss, what's going on?  What's happening?  Uh, long ring.  I need one ring on this.  Whoa.  Sweetie.  Hi, Rich.  Hey.  That was a lot. 
[03:05:00]  Listen, don't laugh too hard.  What?  All right.  What's the problem now?  How's Bonnie?  She's great.  She's in, actually, she's on her way to Canada this morning.  Canada?  You guys have kind of a long-distance relationship sometimes, don't you?  Well, she went back to Los Angeles last week, yeah.  Last week?  Are you allowed to see other people?  What, other girls?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  Who would do that?  I just don't know because I don't know what kind of relationship you guys have because 
[03:05:30]  sometimes you don't see each other for a while and you're great distances apart.  And I just, I don't know.  Maybe you have an arrangement.  No, no.  She, uh, she said to me, uh, she goes, that I can tell my friends that, uh, that I hit  her so they don't think I'm pussy with.  Yeah.  She goes, if you want to tell your friends.  You know, she's so funny.  She wrote a joke last night.  She goes, just because I don't know my left or my right doesn't mean I should be raped.  That's a great woman joke, yeah.  That's such a cute little joke. 
[03:06:00]  Isn't that a good one?  That is a good one.  Typical female comics.  I like women that do rape jokes, I gotta be honest.  That doesn't make me happy.  Very funny.  All right.  Uh, you don't have Easy Pass, Rich?  No.  He's another one.  Now, Rich, uh, unlike Opie, Rich drives a lot.  And what, you sit in those cash lanes?  What's the difference?  So you go through the lane a minute quicker.  A minute?  A minute?  No, Rich, no.  Where are you, East Bumfuck?  You're here in New York City where the toll lines last a half hour sometimes. 
[03:06:30]  No, do you think the toll line at the Lincoln Tunnel, once you go through the Easy Pass,  it's just clear right through the toll?  It's still backed up?  No, but you'll save yourself 15 minutes.  I used to commute in every day.  I'm trying not to yell.  I used to commute in every day.  Yeah, I know.  When you left your parents' house, okay, where you lived, and you went to a gig.  No, I lived in, no, no, no, no.  I lived in, uh, with Florentine in Jersey.  I would commute in every day, and I would fly through the toll, and I don't understand. 
[03:07:00]  It was guys like you sitting there in their cars listening to their awful Tom Waits music,  and that's why there was traffic buildup.  No, no, no.  Are you out of your mind?  No.  First of all, do you know that Easy Pass that, uh, they can keep a record of how fast you go  from one, from point A to point B?  We were discussing that.  I'm so glad you got your XM satellite radio hooked up.  Who, me?  Jesus.  First of all, I'd like to get a deal on that.  One of the reasons I don't have Easy Pass is too much paperwork.  Like, I saw, I got the paperwork, and it's like they want a whole history of your life. 
[03:07:30]  It's too much stuff to fill out.  Hi, Rich, it's Bonnie.  Hi.  I got a new joke.  Just because I don't know my left from my right doesn't mean I should have to fuck Rich  Vaughn.  Poofy.  How much is his laugh as he's going to start coughing?  Jesus. 
[03:08:00]  It's time to get rid of that cigarette habit of yours.  How much paperwork is Easy Pass?  Name, address.  No, it looks like a bunch of stuff.  But that's not how you, that's not why there's traffic, because there's people that don't  have Easy Pass.  That alleviates traffic, so it is partially a huge contributor.  Your fault.  And it also, you know, it also alleviates people's jobs and stuff.  Good.  Good.  Well, you know.  They're not people.  They're savage.  Nasty toll takers.  Vicious.  All right.  Well, no, we don't want to listen anymore, actually. 
[03:08:30]  This is going nowhere.  What do you mean?  What am I supposed to do?  It'd be funny, because I don't have Easy Pass?  Well, I don't even know why we have you on the phone, to be honest.  All right, Rich, you don't have Easy Pass, and go.  Funny, come on.  Jesus.  When I tag you on the shoulder, make like you don't have Easy Pass.  Okay, can we have an occupation?  All right, a doctor.  A doctor without Easy Pass.  Go.  Go.  Oh, man.  I'll admit, you're in a bad spot here.  Yeah, so what am I doing? 
[03:09:00]  I mean, you know.  We're not blaming you.  I mean, casually, Norton goes, I bet your boss doesn't have Easy Pass.  Oh, Anthony said boss.  Oh, okay.  During the commercial break, Ben decides to get you on the line, and this is nothing.  Yeah, well, I know.  All of a sudden, now I'm Robert Kelly.  No, Robert Kelly, he's been funny.  Oh.  No, he actually had a great appearance on our show.  Yes, he did.  He will be invited back.  That's good.  As well as you, Rich.  I will.  Oh, guess what?  What, Rich? 
[03:09:30]  Oh, he got us.  Shit.  I can't believe I just got gotten by that dummy.  You got gotten by Rich?  I think he actually had something to say, and then we said, oh, you got us, and he goes,  oh, this is a good idea.  I'm going to hang up now.  Too much paperwork for Easy Pass.  All right.  Why don't we get the Silence of the Lambs thing on?  Occupation.  Sleep inducer.  Where's Steve?  Steve knows what this is all about.  Creep.  This is pretty interesting, no?  The Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  The musical.  Why would they make a musical out of that? 
[03:10:00]  I don't know.  Some of these songs are kind of funny in a weird way.  We're playing show tunes on the Opie and Anthony show.  So what is this about, Steve?  I got it sent to me late last night, and it's some, a couple guys took it upon themselves  to create a mock musical.  Huh?  What?  Thanks, Ant.  Martini Steve.  MS.  A couple guys took it upon themselves to create a mock musical for Silence of the Lambs. 
[03:10:30]  With full show tune production and everything.  All right.  And they're selling this CD?  Certainly, it looks like it.  I got them all for nothing online, but.  All right.  It's like you get everything online for nothing.  The track listing.  And you don't pay your taxes, I hear.  Who?  The track listing.  Silence of the Lambs, track one.  Track two, if I could smell her sea.  Sea word alert today, ladies.  Sea word alert.  Three, are you about a size 14? 
[03:11:00]  Oh.  I like that.  I remember these little ditties.  Quid pro quo.  Track four.  Track five, it's me.  Track six, which I believe we're going to listen to right now.  Put the effing lotion in the basket.  Track seven, we're going in.  Track eight, In the Dark with a Maniac.  And track nine, Silence of the Lambs.  Reprieve and finale.  How is she a great big fat person, not a hit already?  Really?  That could be the best line in the movie. 
[03:11:30]  Well, which one?  Is she a great big fat person?  You want to do track six?  Large girl.  Great big fat person.  Oh, boy, is she a great big fat person?  After he already sliced diamonds into her back and threw her in the water.  How great is that?  Frederica Bimmel.  All right, let's give this one a listen.  Track six.  Track six, Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  Yeah.  Put the effing lotion in the basket. 
[03:12:00]  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  That's pretty good.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human. 
[03:12:30]  So I call them bitch instead of by their names.  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop drying out your big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote. 
[03:13:00]  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So, wipe down before I jam a bath.  I pound your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go, this isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  The mind's a broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  She's down here, you piece of shit. 
[03:13:30]  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you. 
[03:14:00]  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head, put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Hey, man. 
[03:14:30]  That's all right.  That is all right.  I felt like I was there.  That's all right.  At a musical.  Watching that scene.  The musical.  I like the...  The moaning in the movie.  I did not like it at first, and then when you just played it, that is hilarious.  That is really good.  That's great.  I noticed that Channel 9 has arrived, Anthony.  Oh, just in time. 
[03:15:00]  Channel 9 has arrived.  I forgot they're here today.  Why don't we turn down all the XM radios.  Oh, please.  So they don't get to hear the C word song.  How great was the thing where he talks about the fingernail she climbed halfway up.  Oh, that was failed.  Very funny.  He sounded a little like Dr. Evil at the beginning of the song, but kind of got into it.  Before we do the If I Could Smell Her See, which is a very famous part of the movie as well.  Oh, of course.  Which you want to hear maybe in the dark with a maniac. 
[03:15:30]  That's a pretty good scene from Silence of the Lambs.  Is it?  Unless you see another one you like better.  Are you a size 14 any good?  I don't know.  I didn't check that one out.  I can't believe they didn't say anything about a fat person.  Radio's off.  Thank you.  Are you a size 14?  Oh, smash that cast into the back of the head like Bundy.  I kind of like the Buffalo Bill vocals.  Are you a size 14?  You want to try that one?  Are you about a size 14? 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Let's try Buffalo Bill again.  Are you a size 14?  I want to hear that dumb song all day in my head now.  All right.  Here we go.  Are you about a size 14?  Superficial people, I don't think looks matter.  Some folks weigh a hundred pounds, but I want someone fatter.  I want a girl who'll fit me to a tee.  A woman who'll look good on me. 
[03:16:30]  Say.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  In order to get victims, you've got a lion trigger.  So I put my arm inside a sling.  I've got her in my sight, she's appropriately fat.  I'll wait for her to notice me, I hope she fed her cat.  She's perfect, yes, but another thing will need you to be seen.  Is she about a size 14?  You'll see me with this couch, I'll get her in the van. 
[03:17:00]  I'll punch her in the face and drive away and that's the plan.  I'll cut off all the skin and wear it like a dress.  I'll dump her in the ocean and let the cops clean up the mess.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  If you want to find the one you need, I'll throw the weights a ton.  And she's also gotta be naive.  I'll keep her in a well, you'll never ever find her.  I'll tuck my dick between my legs, you'll think it's a vagina.  I'll look just like a girl, by golly I'll have fun. 
[03:17:30]  But for now be quiet, she'll make a samplers or she calls.  Can I give you a high end with that?  Yeah, you look a little handicapped.  She's coming towards the van, I'll ask what you get in.  I'll check her tag and if she gets a cut off all your skin.  Are you about a size 14?  Are you about a size 14?  My hobbies include sewing and the life feeling's it going.  And I'll put you in a hole where you can scream. 
[03:18:00]  I'll bet you she's a size 14.  I'm looking for a size 14.  She brought this on herself because she offered me her help.  And she's an idiot for trusting me.  Are you about a size 14?  His plan was worth the weight.  He's got her in his trunk.  She took the bait and now she's out of luck.  This is great.  This is great stuff, man.  I want to hear In the Dark with a Maniac. 
[03:18:30]  All right.  That was a classic scene from Silence of the Lambs.  This is Clarice, Buffalo Bill, and Catherine.  And Catherine, yes.  It's going to be an extravaganza.  That's right.  It's Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  The radios are down, right?  Yes.  Yes, they're all down.  All right.  Because we're doing an interview with Channel 9 and they're going to be rolling B-roll soon.  No audio on In the Office.  No audio whatsoever, right?  Okay.  Because it looks like that reporter would be very offended. 
[03:19:00]  Which one?  The one with the blonde hair?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I recognize her.  I forgot her name.  Pat something, I think.  Sally Jessie?  She's about a size 14.  That head shape.  All right.  Let's check this out.  In the Dark with a Maniac.  Who turned out the lights?  I can't see a thing.  Don't want to play games with this sick diggling.  These goggles I'm wearing.  I've everything green.  I can practically touch her without reading seeing.  I'm creeping around in the dark with a maniac. 
[03:19:30]  Can't see him, can't hear him.  I'm practically blind as a bat.  Bet you he'll make me the latest addition to all of the girls he's whacked.  Even though I'm real thin and the rest of his victims were packed.  Is he here?  Is he there?  I can't tell if he's near.  So I hope he can't see me.  I'm shaking with fear.  Should've shot him before he could give me this card.  Will you fuck me?  I fuck me.  I fuck me real hard.  I must have been crazy for coming here solo.  I need reinforcements.  Let's play more O'Folo.  I'm creeping around in the dark with a maniac. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, for goodness, I'm staying.  I can't shoot you unless I can see you.  So turn on the light.  I've been in here for days.  You'll be lucky to leave here alive with your brains in turn.  It must be nice, Kenny.  Let's go back to Rage and behave and we'll have a fair fight.  Get me out of this basement, you dumb fucking man.  Hold your horses.  I'm trying.  I can't find the switch.  He was tracking.  I'm killing her.  Well, look who she's found.  Now I'm pulling the triggers.  You're going to turn around.  This guy is pure evil right down to the corner.  He's hopes filled with corpses and poodles and gores. 
[03:20:30]  She's creeping around in the dark with a maniac no more.  All right.  It's okay.  That was the three-part vocals.  Yeah, a little confusing.  The music was a little loud in that one, but all right.  I think we're time for the showstopper.  Hoppy.  We're going to go to track two.  The radios are off, right, guys?  All right.  Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.  And we want to warn the ladies, C-word alert, C-word alert, C-word alert. 
[03:21:00]  Why are you warning them?  Just so they don't hear it and think it's their husband's calling them?  Well, you know, women get very offended by this word, and so I'm going to give them  a little heads up.  I'm basically telling my mom to turn off the radio.  Good boy.  All right.  If I Could Smell Her C, sung by Dr. Lecter himself.  Hold on to your hats, kids.  Now, what did Migs say to you?  Multiple Migs in the next cell. 
[03:21:30]  He hissed at you.  What did he say?  He said, I can smell your cunt.  I see.  I myself cannot.  If I could smell her cunt, she'd help me taste humanity again.  And if I promised not to eat her then, perhaps she'd even be my friend. 
[03:22:00]  If I could smell her cunt.  If I could smell her cunt.  If I could only who I am, I'd snap my fingers for a new man.  I want to smell her bearded clam.  I almost can.  I'm trapped behind this painted glass.  A man who needs a taste of glass.  I'm sitting on my bony ass.  And now, this woman.  I'd like to tell her I don't care.  I've got something in her eyes. 
[03:22:30]  I'd like to tell her life's not fair.  A cement between my thighs.  Lonely, lonely lunatic.  I want to know what makes her tick.  If only she would let me think I'm pretty brave.  I want a new relationship.  The kind that challenges my wit.  The kind that doesn't leave behind a bloody stain.  If I could smell her cunt.  She'd help me find the man I used to be.  And if I promised not to serve her as an uncle. 
[03:23:00]  She'd be friends with me.  If I could smell her cunt.  If I could smell her cunt.  If I could tell her I saw this case.  Perhaps they'd let me leave this place.  For one that has a bit more space.  I'd like to see a tree.  Lonely, lonely lunatic.  I'm charming, but I'm also sick.  I need an audience for my stick.  Perhaps it could be she.  I could do it all again. 
[03:23:30]  I'm out to come on a fly.  Erase the gruesome things I've done.  And smell her cherry pie.  If I could smell her cunt.  If she would grant my simple voice.  I could reclaim my grasp on sanity.  I know she smells like snow fish.  If I could smell her cunt.  If I could smell her cunt. 
[03:24:00]  Am I crazy?  I can't tell.  My tears rotting in this cell.  Feels a lot like I'm in hell.  If only I could smell her cunt.  If I could smell her cunt.  Haunting.  Haunting.  It had its moments.  The guy's got to learn how to mix a little bit. 
[03:24:30]  Turn down the music a bit and turn up the vocals.  That would help his little musical.  His venture.  I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between that and like a real good musical.  Right.  Like that seems like, all right, I'd go see that.  I laughed.  I cried.  See, the showstopper.  I left with jizz in my hair.  The showstopper should have been, you know, put the effing lotion in the basket.  But there you have it.  Who knew?  So there it is.  The Silence of the Lambs.  The musical.  And we'll put a link up on foundrymusic.com and opiananthony.com. 
[03:25:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  James Gum just got you.  Jamie Gum.  James.  All right.  Ben is running block.  Ben is brilliant.  He's been talking to Pat Collins for the last 20 minutes, so she didn't hear any of that crap.  What are they discussing?  Whose head is more misshapen?  Misshapen?  Ugh.  All right.  Those are fine glasses, too.  If you could smell her. 
[03:25:30]  Why did Channel 9 send her?  I don't know.  She's not going to get us.  Maybe all.  She doesn't understand our program, I don't think.  She's going to be horrified.  You think she's going to do some welding with those glasses when she's finished?  Those are awful.  Those are horrible Richard Speck glasses.  Don't look at the sun with those on.  It'll burn right through your head.  All right.  Oh, she really stinks.  Ben, what's going on out there?  Yeah, what's that moon head doing?  Yeah, what's going on?  You were speaking with the Channel 9 people?  Yeah, no.  They're just, they want to get ready for the story.  They're going to come in and do some shots, and they know that Jim's a part of the festival, 
[03:26:00]  so I'm going to interview you guys after the show.  What was she doing?  Was she looking at your hair, asking where the fan is?  Nice sweatshirt.  Gold's Jim.  Oh.  Very original.  Did Dice buy that for you?  You know what?  He did give this to me.  I'm sure Dice got that for you.  That is the worst sweatshirt I've ever seen.  I dress for it.  You tacked my hair.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  When you hang with Dice, though, he buys you stuff.  We got these.  No, he doesn't.  He got it for free, and he gave it to me.  Oh, actually, he doesn't really buy stuff.  He makes, like, deals with these stores. 
[03:26:30]  That's what happened.  We went into a store.  He goes, come shopping with me.  So me and Opie go with him, and we walked into some sporting store.  Right around here.  Sports apparel store.  Sports authority or something like that.  And he picks out clothes for us.  Yeah, I'm going to get, I got some of these.  You guys should have one.  And he hands us these Everlast.  Huge, black.  Pullover sweatshirts with hoods.  And the pockets in the front, you know, that you could touch your own hands together in the pockets.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  And he brings them up to the counter.  He's like, how much? 
[03:27:00]  And the person's like, the price is right on there.  You know, he rings it up.  It was something like 120 bucks.  He's like, I'll give you 50.  And then he argues with the guy.  You're not in, well, you're not in India.  You're here in the USA.  You pay the price that's on the tag.  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  I ain't paying no more than $70.  Oh, and that's it.  And he bargains back and forth.  And eventually, you know.  Yeah, they come back, they give him the bread. 
[03:27:30]  He doesn't let us pick out what we want to wear, though.  It has to be extra, extra large sweatshirts that we haven't worn since we wore them.  I don't wear those.  Mine's in the bottom of my drawer.  Can I have it?  Yeah.  It would definitely fit you.  The irony of Jim's shirt is that he's probably never seen the inside of a Gold's Gym.  There's a point.  It would actually be, if I wore a shirt saying I'm black and I'm proud, it would be more accurate  than me wearing a Gold's Gym shirt.  And by the way, what time is the Velociraptor doing the interview?  Oh, wow. 
[03:28:00]  Dude, the cameraman's in the other room.  Yeah, he's already, like, shooting B-roll.  He's shooting all the meters and stuff.  Are they listening?  Yeah.  Hi.  Good job.  Oh, he's shooting that important shot.  Oh, it's turned down.  The shot of the meters.  I just got the word in my headphones.  Do they talk to you, Opie, from the other booth?  Well, no, because I'm in another Jack.  No, but you can talk to everybody individually.  I don't do this Jack.  I do that Jack.  Oh, everybody except Opie?  Yeah.  Can you tell me how big a boy you are?  Yeah, they can talk to you.  Yeah, occasionally they pop in on my ear and tell me stuff. 
[03:28:30]  He's in your ear?  Yeah.  He's in my ear.  What's he saying?  What are you doing later?  Hi.  Oh, the light just came on.  Wow.  This is what Anthony hears.  Do you have a big cock?  Monster rain sweeping through the area.  I can smell your B-roll.  Oh, this is going to be this footage that they're going to use?  Here at the studios of XM Satellite Radio, and then they'll show the screen that's broken  with the phone calls on it, and they'll show the guys in the booth, the back of their heads, 
[03:29:00]  and then they'll come in here and show us.  Which they're about to do, Anthony.  They're about to do that.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, yeah?  Is there anything you want to hear going into break?  What about the wow song?  The wow song?  It's freezing out, but it's Wednesday.  All right, we'll do the freezing in certain areas of the United States.  By the way, Jim, that was my Marion comeback.  What about your sweatshirt?  It's like a Marion comeback.  Hey, sweatshirt.  Look at that hair. 
[03:29:30]  What about your hair?  That's our comeback.  The Marion comeback.  All right, this is a Ben pick.  You look like a retard.  You look like a retard.  What about you, retard?  I think you're a retard.  Wait, Ben, this isn't going to work.  Why not, Oak?  Oh, okay, it'll work.  Getting some glitches fixed here?  All right.  Steve.  No, no.  No, no.  We're from man Wednesday now. 
[03:30:00]  We're from man Wednesday.  With them out.  It's come out.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady now.  Come on, lady.  Come on and open your blouse.  Open your blouse.  Flash your boobies at girls  Show your melons to guys  If you're not tanked below the dashboard  Well, lift those babies up high 
[03:30:30]  Wow  Wow  Take them out, baby  And flap them around  Flap them around  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, lady  Now, come on, lady  Cause that's what wow is about  What wow is about  You've got to lose that shirt  Lose that shirt 
[03:31:00]  And let those fun bags bounce  Fun bags bounce  Big or small, firm or saggy  Firm or saggy  Just let those jugs come out  Let those jugs come out  I was walking down the street  And some construction guy was shouting at me  Hey, show me your cans 
[03:31:30]  So I did  And he plummeted 17 floors  And was impaled on a forklift  But my tits look great  Please  Wow responsibly  A public service announcement  Of the O.P. and Anthony Show  How long you been smoking, sir?  Fifty years  Did you start when you were one?

[03:32:30]  You ever try and quit?  See, I love that  Every smoker  You ever try and quit?  Mm-hmm  I'm trying right now  Believe it or not  You may find it's hard to believe  Did you try cold turkey?  That's the hardest  Yeah, you've got to quit gradually  That's what I'm going to do  Quit gradually  What I'm going to do is  I'm going to lose one lung  A little while later  I'm going to lose the other one 
[03:33:00]  And that's it  I got a plan  Dude, can I bum one cigarette from you, man?  I'm trying to quit buying  Thank you, sir  Fifty years of smoking  You're giving me fucking hope  I was going to quit  Until I saw you  Fuck it  I saw this documentary recently  On whales  This guy has dedicated his life 
[03:33:30]  To telling you  What the whales are saying  Wow  I don't know how you'd argue with him  When he turns in his report  And he just throws it down there  Well, here's what the whales are saying  Okay, thanks, Charlie  Just looking back  Here's what the whales are saying  Yeah, Charlie figured it out  They show how he does it  He's out on a ship  He's got a pencil 
[03:34:00]  And he deciphers the whale noises  As he hears them  You know, he'll hear like  He's like  Oh, okay  He's lonely  No, you're lonely  I'd like to do that 
[03:34:30]  For like two weeks  And then turn around  And find out that the door's  Squeaking behind you  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio  XM satellite radio  Radio to the power of X  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony 
[03:35:00]  Ooh, it's in my shoes  Ramone, clean this up  I say, don't you know  You say, you don't know  I say, you don't know  Take me out  Oh, you gotta do that, man  Yeah, do that  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  We're inviting Channel 9  Into the studio  Oh, here we are  To film some B-roll  Don't make it obvious, dude 
[03:35:30]  We'll talk about it in a minute  You gotta do that, though  Yeah  Alright, very good  And I guess Pat Collins from Channel 9  Is gonna be interviewing us  Right after the show, Anthony  Oh, yeah  Cool  It is the ONA virus spreading  Slowly but surely  Across America  Thanks to XM satellite radio  We're just really  Kind of screwing off today  Because there wasn't much in the news  They're fleeing the interview  You're fleeing the interview  So we're just kind of making things up  As we go along here today  And the phones kind of don't work  And, uh, but we're still having a good time, right? 
[03:36:00]  Rolling along  You know what we can play here, Anthony?  What?  We're getting all the stuff from our old show  Back, slowly but surely  Thanks to the listeners  Yeah  I'm telling you, the listeners  Really helping out the new version  Of the Opie and Anthony show  I mean, every day  My email is filled with things  That we could use on the show  That we used to have  Dude, don't make it obvious, though  Because it has to happen  Um  You can't stop looking  Oh, yeah 
[03:36:30]  Let's play  Hey, guess what?  All right  So, um  I got the Orson Welles outtake, Anthony  It's one of our favorite things of all time  What a prick this guy was  Yeah  What a complete prick  He did a lot of commercials  Especially at the end of his career  Uh, he did a lot of voiceover work  He had that voice  That low voice  And, uh, he would do commercials for anything  This guy was pretty much a whore  But, he still had this attitude 
[03:37:00]  Like he was the master thespian  And he'd bring the attitude into the studio with him  When he's recording these commercials  And treat these poor engineers  That are making nothing  Like crap  Just treat them like garbage  And, uh  This is a couple of examples of that  I thought he was doing Shakespeare over here  He's doing commercials for Peas  Yeah, frozen peas  Frozen peas  And what else was it?  Hamburgers or something?  Hamburgers  Chopped meat  Fish sticks  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Beans 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, this was obviously at the end of his career  Yeah, at the end of his career  It was awful  He was just voicing commercials in a studio  Somewhere in England, I think  Big, bloated mess that he was, too  At that time in his life  He was just so fat  You could see him on those Dean Martin roasts  He was doing commercials in Dean Martin roasts  Don't touch it  Don't even look at it  It's, uh  He was doing those Dean Martin roasts  And he'd sit back in the chair drinking  And when he would tilt his head back  And do one of those big, fake guffaws  His whole body would shake 
[03:38:00]  And the dais would shake  I remember watching those  So he's just a big, fat, bloated, miserable man  Doing these commercials  Very miserable at the end of his life  So we got the outtakes of him doing a commercial  And just berating the guy in the booth  Here's the shot they're going to use  Opie and Anthony  Yeah  Because I'm being very animated  When I'm talking about that fat fuck  Can you read my lips?  Fuck  Did they get that or did they have to leave it?  Oh, they got that  And they're very happy  They got that on camera  There'll be no sound on this  There'll be no sound on this  He might have a microphone hooked up there  Nah, they don't use that 
[03:38:30]  That might be a microphone right there  I don't know  It's a microphone on the camera  But it's not really  They can't really use that  It's not like the quality  You're not allowed to talk?  Yeah  I was taking feed from the board  Alright, calm down, dude  Oh, it's coming from the board?  You're hooked up?  Oh  Oh, great  Oops  Well, thanks for telling us, Steve and Ben  I didn't know  I thought it was just some B-roll  That they were going to use to, you know  Oh, and I fucking said fuck  That's not good  Alright, so here's the outtake 
[03:39:00]  And we'll stop it as we go here, right?  Let's listen  So who is he mad at?  He's mad at the guy that's the engineer  Like, uh, uh  Producing the commercial  And then he's mad at the guy  That wrote the copy for the commercial  Yeah, there's some guy that wrote the copy  The producer  There's a couple of people in there  And he's just angry at everybody  It's not worth his time  Yeah  To even be there  This should be a run-in, run-out  And they kind of want him to work at it a little bit  And he's just a prick  Alright, here's Orson Welles  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire  Where Mrs. Buckley lives  Every July, peas grow there 
[03:39:30]  Do you really mean that?  Yeah, so in other words  I'd start half a second later  Don't you think you really want to say July over the snow?  Isn't that the fun of it?  It's, if you make it almost when that shell disappears  It'll make money  I think it's so nice that you see a snow-covered field  And say every July, peas grow there  We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire  Where Mrs. Buckley lives  Every July, peas grow there  We aren't even in the fields, you see  Yeah, yeah 
[03:40:00]  We're talking about them growing and she's picked them  Yeah  On what?  On July  I don't understand you then  When must, what must be over for July?  When we get out of the snowy field  When I was out  We were onto a can of peas  A big dish of peas when I said in July  See, what they're doing  They're syncing up video  Yeah, they're syncing up video  They have like a video screen that he's watching  And he's doing a voiceover for the commercial  Yeah  So, I guess it goes from a snowy field 
[03:40:30]  Why are we on the snowy field?  And it goes to a big bowl of peas  And he's angry that his copy has him reading  That they're talking about the peas when they're still on the snowy field  He's just angry  And he starts getting more and more snippy with these people  Yeah, let's continue  Oh, I'm sorry  Yes, always  I'm always past that  Yes  Well, that's about where I say in July  You emphasize a bit in  In July 
[03:41:00]  Why?  That doesn't make any sense  Sorry  There's no known way of saying an English sentence  In which you begin a sentence with in and emphasize it  Get me a jury and show me how you can say in July  And I'll go down on you  Wow  Get me a jury  Get me a jury  There's monster rain coming  Here in Lancashire  The monster rains come every winter  We must all run  Look, see, I'm already under the porch with my pants down 
[03:41:30]  And Jimmy's not here yet  Where's Jimmy Norton?  Every spring after the snow thaws, the monster rains come  Look, I've got a little dick in my mouth and he's not doing anything for me  You don't say put it in my mouth  Find me a jury, I'll go down on you  This guy is just nasty  He's just a nasty guy  In, in, but I do agree with him  Why would you say in July 
[03:42:00]  In July  In July  In July  In July  He did War of the World and Citizen Kane  And now he's hawking peas to people with bad teeth  I don't blame him for being unhappy  That monster rain thing is good  Monster rain  Here in Lancashire, we're always under the porch  Looking for a little playmate  Put your hand out under the porch  You could feel the monster rains soaking your hands  And something else soaking your face  All right, let's 
[03:42:30]  There are a little more of them  Yeah, why not  That's just idiotic  You'll forgive me if I say  That's just stupid  In July  I'd love to know how you emphasize in and in July  Impossible  Meaningless  I think all they were thinking about was that they didn't want to  He isn't thinking  Well, listen, can we just do one last one  Yeah  It was my fault  I said in July  If you can leave every July  You didn't say it  He said it  Your friend  Every July 
[03:43:00]  No, you don't really mean every July  But that's the best bad copy  It's in July  Of course it's every July  Too much directing around here  Norway  Fish fingers  No  Find this Norway  Now he's selling fish sticks  Now he goes to selling fish sticks  What's wrong with every July?  I don't know  He didn't like it  It doesn't have to be perfect  You know why?  The mistake was  It was never in July  It was every July  And that could be emphasized 
[03:43:30]  Every July  But I guess someone screwed up on his copy  And he kind of got used to saying in  So now he didn't like every either  He's just angry that it was changed at all  The incompetence here  Amazing  You fucking limeys  What's wrong with you?  And then he's right on to hawking fish sticks  We know a certain fjord in Norway  Near where the cod gather in great shoals  There, Jansp, Stangeland 
[03:44:00]  Shit  A fraction more on that shoals thing  Because you roll it around very nicely  Yeah, roll it around and I have no more time  You don't know what I'm up against  Because it's full of things that are only correct  Because they're grammatical  But they're tough on the ear  You see, this is a very wearying one  It's unpleasant to read  Unrewarding  Unrewarding  Unrewarding  Life is unrewarding  He's talking about fish sticks  It's unrewarding  Fish sticks  Of course it's unrewarding 
[03:44:30]  What an idiot  And he's trying to make these breaded  Lousy breaded fish sticks sound great  There's a fjord  Where the cod gather in great shoals  There's a cardboard box  In a freezer section of a supermarket  With cardboard tasting fish sticks  My life is hell  It's awful what this guy's life came down to  Because Findus  Freeze the cod at sea  And then add a crumb crisp 
[03:45:00]  Crumb crisp coating  That's tough  Crumb crisp coating  I think  No, because of the way it's written  You need to break it up  Because it's not  It's not as conversationally written  What?  Take crumb out  Take crumb out  Good  Here under protest is beef burgers  Now he's going on to burgers  Crumb crisp coating  It's too much  Take crumb out  He's like rewriting the copy 
[03:45:30]  For this poor guy  He's just sitting there  He's got to listen to this guy  Yelling at him  God knows how many quid he made a week  Oh, he's making nothing  Doing this commercial  He's got Orson Welles berating him  One of the great actors of our  Of olden times  Of our time  We will serve no wine before it's time  Remember he was hawking the wine  Very good, Jimmy  And there he is in the studio  Trying to hawk fish sticks  Crisp crumb coating  Too much  Too much  Now he's on to beef  There's a sled  With crisp crumb coating 
[03:46:00]  Crisp crumb coating  Bread crumbs fall like snowflakes  On these fish sticks  By selling fish sticks  Somebody kill me  It's awful  Poor guy  We know a little place  In the American far west  Where Charlie Briggs  Chops up the finest  Prairie fed beef  And tastes  This is a lot of shit  You know that  He's just miserable  That is awful  He just knew where his life was then 
[03:46:30]  You know, Citizen Kane  Was well in his past  When he's hawking beef  We know a man  In the plains  That hacks up cows  Didn't it sound awful  The way he said it  He butchers  Shoves a bolt  Through their stupid cow heads  Which I wish someone  Would do to me now  Selling hamburgers  I went backwards  Let's try that again  Where Charlie Briggs  Chops up the finest  Prairie fed beef  And tastes  This is a lot of shit 
[03:47:00]  You know that  You want one more?  You want one more?  You missed the first beef  Actually completely  What do you mean missing?  You're emphasizing prairie fed  But you can't emphasize beef  That's like he's wanting me  To emphasize in  Before July  Come on fellas  You're losing your heads  I wouldn't direct  Any living actor like this  In Shakespeare  When you do this  It's impossible  Orson you did six last year  And by far and away the best  And I know the reason  The right reading for this  Is the one I'm giving it 
[03:47:30]  At the moment  I spend  Twenty times more  For you people  Than any other commercial  I've ever made  You are such pests  Now what is it you want  In your depths  Of your ignorance  What is it you want?  Whatever it is you want  I can't deliver  Because I just don't see it  That was absolutely fun  He just writes them off  His pen  And then he just  Walks out of the studio  Dude he directed  Citizen Kane  I mean he knows  How to direct 
[03:48:00]  He's not some idiot  And I'm glad he's telling  These ad hoc faggots  How to do something  Good for Orson Welles  You pests  Exactly  In the depths  Of your ignorance  Oh I wouldn't direct  A living actor  In Shakespeare  Okay what are we doing  The fish sticks  Or the peas  In July  In July  Good for him  Alas poor dead cow  I knew him  Poor bastard  There it is  Poor  We got the Orson Welles  Back on our show 
[03:48:30]  Cool  Yes that we'll be referring to  Forever and ever now  Oh yeah now that we got it  Out there again  Crumb crisp coating  What do I remove  The coating  Crumb crisp  No that doesn't sound good  Crumb coating  Without the crisp  No coating  I can't remove that  That would be stupid  Just babbles on and on  Depths of your ignorance  The depths of your ignorance  Hey Rob  What's going on  Hey Rob  Hey Rob  We lose Rob  Yeah what's up buddy  Hello  Hey man  Okay I learned that 
[03:49:00]  If Ashley stays on the same pants  She's going to be on  Crack World Confessions  In about a year  Oh Ashley  Good old Ashley  Yeah we got that update  If you're just tuning in  The program  You can listen to the update  During the replay  The mother daughter  From yesterday  All day long  I  Yes  He was trying to get us  He was trying to get us  And he couldn't hang up right  He couldn't even hang up right  Idiot  He couldn't hang up his phone  All right  Should we play  What do we learn  What an educational program  We had today  Or can we take a break  This is like Sesame Street  You want to talk to Pat Collins  Well you're sitting there 
[03:49:30]  With the headphones on  You got the microphone  In front of you  Yeah good morning  Hi  Hello  Can we all sing  The Sesame Street theme  35 years  Yes I'd like to hear  You guys do it  Educational program  I know it is  We do What Did You Learn  On the Opie and Anthony show  At the end of every show  And you'll be amazed  The education that people get  From this program  Yeah Pat Collins is from  Channel 9  Little Things They Learn  And when is this going to air  Tomorrow  It's tomorrow night  Your piece is tomorrow night  Because we're promoting  In addition to your show  Here on Satellite Radio 
[03:50:00]  Your appearance at the  New York Comedy Festival  And Jim  You're going to be part of it too  The passion of O&A  Yes we want to know  A little bit about that  Going to take on Mel Gibson  Uh no  Be careful  Actually I think  Our show is a little more  Disturbing than the movie was  Yeah I believe so  Yeah  They're not eligible  For a Golden Globe Award  Well they would be  In the foreign language category  But the Golden Globe  I never  Committee  I know  Said no you can't be 
[03:50:30]  In the best picture category  Because it's in Latin  And Aramaic  Two languages  Not frequently spoken  In our country  And obviously not  By the Golden Globe  Committee  Did you like that movie?  Uh actually I did not  I hated that movie  No I did not  No I know we're going  To get mail on this  Including from my mother  And yours probably  No I didn't  I went with my dad  He cried through the whole movie  He absolutely loved it  But I  I thought it was  Just over the top  It's like alright  We get what's going on here  I know exactly  And also for people 
[03:51:00]  Who do not know  Their bible  And that would be  Lots of people  He did not put  The events on  The film  In it's proper  Historic context  You have to understand  The period of the time  In terms of how  That world felt  About the Jews  Of that day  And the role  That they played  And they were feared  By the Romans  And of course  Pontius Pilate  Was in a political  Sticky wicket  Because if he  Had sided 
[03:51:30]  With the disciples  Of Christ  And with Jesus himself  He could have  Lost his job  So you know  Politically  This guy was  In the hot seat  So I thought  That Mal  Losing his job  Over religious controversy  I know  Wow  How contemporary  That's interesting  That doesn't happen  Does it  And Opie  I don't know  If you saw it too  And we see a lot  Of violent  My line of work  As a film critic  See a lot of  Violet movies  But I thought  It was really  Over the top  Like you say  We get it  We understand  How brutal  I think crucifixion  In general  Is believed to be 
[03:52:00]  A horrific  Method of death  I don't think  We have to see  Every last  Little detail  Yes  However  Amazing box office  But the big question  Will be  How the Oscar committee  Will decide  To treat  Passion of Christ  I'm waiting for the video game  To come out  Yes well  I think you have a long wait  Also popular now  Making video games  Out of movies  Where's that one  Now is Michael Moore  Going to go  For best picture  Because his stupid  Facts are being called  Into question  So now the best documentary  Probably won't happen 
[03:52:30]  So now  Did he play it  Right before the election  To kind of sneak his way  Out of being called out  On his facts  So now he's going to go  For best picture  Fahrenheit 9-11  Yeah  Because I can't win  A Golden Globe  Because it's a documentary  And they don't have  A documentary  That is the Oscars  Right  No it's the Golden Globe  As well  Golden Globe  Yes  You can't  They don't hand out  Documentary prizes  On the other hand  As just pointing out  The Oscars do  Yeah  But he having won  An Oscar for  Bowling from Columbine  Feels well  I want to step this up  I want to be  In the best picture  Not a chance  I think it's because 
[03:53:00]  His facts are going to  Be called into question  And he'd be embarrassed  At being called out  On it not being  An accurate documentary  And he's going to go  No no I didn't want  It to be a documentary  I wanted it to be  Kind of a  You understand  I think he kind of  Played it before the election  Just to kind of  Give himself  An unembarrassing hour  Right  I think that's  A good point  And people who saw  The film  When he  Ambushed several  Of the members of Congress  And said would you  Send your son  Or nephew  Or whatever  And one congressman  Said he doesn't have  Any sons serving  But it turns out  That his kids 
[03:53:30]  Were like 10 and 12  And he then went on  To say to Michael Moore  But my two nephews  Are serving in Iraq  But that didn't make it  On to the screen  And I know that's  Sort of a newsy  Fine point  But it's a very  Important one  I think  In terms of  His point  That nobody  In the families  Of congressmen  Go into service  Well here's a guy  And I can't remember  The congressman's name  But I think  Jim's got a good point  But I think  He does  Yeah  Yes he does  He's a Roger and me  Facts  Everything he did  Was backwards  He screwed up 
[03:54:00]  The timelines on purpose  And you're presenting  That disingenuously  He's not making documentaries  Hey you do know  What show you came on  Don't you  Yes I do  I thought maybe  You made a mistake  And we're supposed  To be on Imus  This morning  And then all of a sudden  You're in here  What's your opinion  On the Opie and Anthony show  What have you heard  Well we hear  All kinds of things  I think  I think the big question  Will be now that  You're on satellite radio  And you get away  With everything  And everything  Out there  And anything out there  Is  What are your limits  And some days 
[03:54:30]  You know  Or will you be  Outrageous  I mean you are  Outrageous  And very funny  But I think  Don't you think  The pressure's on  More than it was  When you were  Confined by the FCC  Hey I like that question  Sometimes you do  Feel the pressure  I don't think  The pressure's on  As much as it was  When we were on  Commercial radio  To tell you the truth  I think the fact  That everybody's thinking  Oh my god  There's no limits  Now they could be  As outrageous as they want  It sort of takes away  From being outrageous  If you can get away  With murder  Pretty much  I think it's a lot easier 
[03:55:00]  Here than it is  On regular radio  Where they're so strict  And the restrictions  Were coming down  Even harder  Toward the end  Of our tenure  Over there  On commercial radio  That I think  It was  Easier to be outrageous  Easier to want  To be outrageous  On regular radio  Do you hear back  From your listeners  As much  Here as you did  When you were  Yeah  Yeah definitely  They're loving  The new show  Because we can just  Speak openly  That's what they're  More into than anything else  They don't really care  About the stunts  As much as we thought 
[03:55:30]  At the time  But yeah  They just like the show  Because we're just  Openly speaking  About adult subjects  What's the hottest  Adult subject  You think right now  The hottest adult subject  Don't say politics  That's boring  We do talk politics  On the show as well  But what's the hottest  The hottest sexual subject  Would be I guess  I don't know  It seems to be  Well how about that woman  Who's  A lot of  Yeah underage  Yeah how about  Underage sex  Yeah but yes  With an overage woman 
[03:56:00]  It's yeah  The eight year old boyfriend  Of the lady  And wherever she is  You know we haven't  Even discussed that  We haven't even discussed  That news story  Oh you should  I know  We were going to  But then you walked  Into the studio  And you messed up our show  Tune in tomorrow  Underage sex  After the passion  After the passion of Christ  It's hard to talk about  Such a hot story like that  Oh god  That's horrible  Well she's obviously a kook  I think that's what we say  And now she's blaming  The little boy  For you know  Coming on to her I guess 
[03:56:30]  Right  And the boy's  Eight years old  Yeah  She wrote him a letter  Dude I'm not an expert  Or a pedophile  But if you're going to do it  Keep it under your hat  Don't write the kid evidence  You know in letters  And here's the pictures we took  She just does it  She has to get caught  Maybe he came down  In some nice  Garanimals  You know  Had a nice little  Car he was playing with  And he was coming on to her  She's a psychopath  You can look at her  Of course she's a lunatic  I'm sure her husband's  Got to be proud  Look at his friends at work  Yeah  Even the Grevy's wife  Should hang out  I don't know  What did you do wrong 
[03:57:00]  I don't know  How about you  He's got so much to offer  More than you  I'm like  Oh  An eight year old boy  Has more to offer than I do  Great  Fantastic  He listened when I talked  Well that's the end of our music  Nah  We got a few more seconds here  Five seconds  That's it  Three  Two  No no  A little more than that  One  We got more time  We're going to do an interview  With Pat Collins  From Channel 9 News  And it's going to run tomorrow night  Yes  Yes it is  At what time  It's going to be the 10 o'clock news 
[03:57:30]  You'll be on about  On the 10  20  Break  20  Something like that  Alright  Very cool  Very good  And I guess we'll get out of here  Yes we're done  Because that's what we've got to do now  And stay tuned for the replay  A brand new Monster Rain song  Oh yeah  And also an update  From the mother daughter thing  From yesterday  Right  Hot  Hot  Alright  We're out of here  Bye  We're counting down now  This is how we stretch  That's very Sesame Street  I know  Five  Four  Three  One  See you tomorrow  Bye  Bye bye  How do you propose 
[03:58:00]  We get an entire nation  To sit through a massive picture  The OPNM Show  You know what's weird about New York  And I was  This is my little story of my life  I was born in New York  And I grew up in Florida  Hollywood, Florida  Which is a very beautiful place  But it's very different  And I used to talk like this  When I was a little kid  Because I'm from Brooklyn  You know  I used to talk like this  And my mother made the best  Fulpin' spaghetti  In the fuckin' neighborhood  And that's how we talk  And I moved to Florida  And the kids used to make fun  Of my accent  And they're like  Hey kids, say something  Hey, what do you want me to say  And they go 
[03:58:30]  So you become aware of your accent  So it's not really as thick as  But the weird thing about  The New York accent  There's no logical way  The New York accent  Could have been conceived  No logical way  First people in America were who?  The United States were who?  Danish  Danish  Well you have a different textbook  Than we did  Because  It was an Indian thing  I don't know  Maybe you're missing chapter one  Or you're absent that day  How easy we ever get the Indians  But I know what you meant  And you're right in a sense  If you just like  Wipe off the Indians  Like we did  Many, many years ago  You know 
[03:59:00]  That's an easy way to figure that  But the good thing is  That you're ready  With the answer right away  You know  You had 10 or 20 seconds  Before the buzzer  Was going to sound  But you were  Danish  You know what I mean  Unless you were ordering  From the bar  And I didn't  You know what I mean  They were like  Danish  And they were like  Oh shit  The timing was impeccable  You know  But  But anyway  So  The first people in America  Were Indians  And their accent  Is nothing like New York  And the first people  To settle in the United States  In New York  Were British people  And their accent  Is nothing like New York  The Dutch 
[03:59:30]  Well the Dutch  The Dutch didn't stay long  They went all the way down  To Bowling Green  They couldn't find parking  They fucked up  And went home  That's what happened  With the Danish  It's really true  But the British  Actually were the settlers  And they  But no matter what  There's no logical way  The accent could have been conceived  Because even if it was  Indians and Danish  How did Kimasabi  And like  All right  Turn into  Opiole's Joe  You know what I mean  Right  There's no natural progression anywhere  Unless Christopher Columbus  Spoke that way  You know  I was like  Hey who's sailing  The frickin' Nina  Jesus  That boat's going up and down 
[04:00:00]  All over the ocean  Over there  Guy's a freak  Look at him  He's going up and down  He's drunk  Like Delaware  You know  Heather  Just when you had time  To take a breather  XM Satellite Radio  Brings you right off the bench  Get that weak stuff out of here  You hear that sound?
