<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with "Whip-em-out Wednesday," followed by a darkly humorous discussion of the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash, focusing on the co-pilot's potential suicide.  Offensive jokes and a simulated suicidal pilot's announcement were featured, along with caller anecdotes about unsettling flight experiences, including one with a seemingly impaired pilot.  Speculation about the crash, including the "Slurpee brain freeze" theory, continued.  A comedic bit featuring Dice's conversion to Christianity followed, prompting further offensive jokes from the hosts and a caller.

Opie's birthday celebration then commenced, interspersed with an Optimum Online commercial and the return of Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe, who were in studio earlier. An email alleging Nikki Sixx's involvement with a porn star and a wiffle ball bat was discussed.  A trucker caller shared a story about witnessing a woman masturbating in her car. The conversation shifted to *Pearl Harbor*, criticizing its focus on romance over historical accuracy, the lavish premiere, and its perceived appeasement of Japanese audiences.  This segment was rife with offensive racial slurs and comments from both the hosts and callers. Jim Norton joined the show towards the end of this segment.  Further discussion and jokes about the film, the war, and the Red Sox concluded this portion.

The show then transitioned to a segment attempting to arrange a same-sex encounter between Celeste (present in the studio) and a female listener.  This involved numerous sexually explicit comments and jokes, descriptions of Celeste’s appearance, and calls from various listeners, some hesitant or unsuitable.  A lengthy discussion about David Cone's baseball career ensued, utilizing sexually charged metaphors. Jamie Buffalino from *Time Out New York* joined, discussing sexually explicit letters received for his advice column, including those about bestiality and diaper fetishism.  Jim Norton shared a sexually explicit anecdote. The "Motley Crue Challenge," involving a double-ended sex toy and a $100 bill, was mentioned.  Several sponsors, including Sip, Sip, Sipper Steens and Sam Adams beer, were advertised.  Recurring technical problems with the "Stinky Cam" were also mentioned.

The next segment began with speculation about Brady Anderson's sexual orientation, followed by self-deprecating jokes about the hosts' appeal to gay men. The focus returned to arranging a lesbian encounter for Celeste, involving sexually explicit comments and calls to potential guests, one of whom mentioned bringing a dildo.  A detailed and graphic story about Stinky and his roommate, a 63-year-old teacher who allegedly watched child pornography, was recounted.  Jamie from *Time Out New York* contributed to this discussion.  Advertisements for Ultimate V and New York Sports Clubs aired. A call from Kimmy from *Survivor*, Jay Moore's call (filling in for Regis Philbin), and discussions of *Shrek* and *Pearl Harbor* punctuated this segment. The segment concluded with a discussion about Stalker Patty and her potential for adult modeling, further escalating into sexually charged conversations after examining adult film box covers. Priscilla, a female guest, finally arrived for the lesbian encounter with Celeste.

The final segment featured Jim Norton, Jamie from *Time Out New York*, Celeste from PleasureVIP.com, and Patty Davis. The main focus was a vulgar and sexually explicit examination of pornography, with descriptions of various adult films and discussions about numerous sexual acts and preferences. Opie received a bizarre birthday gift exchange, including a pornographic magazine.  The segment culminated in Priscilla and Celeste engaging in explicit sexual acts on the studio couch while the hosts and guests provided commentary.  Planet Java iced coffee was advertised throughout.  The segment maintained extremely crude language and sexually explicit references.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Whip-em-out Wednesday!  What is that? Like some kind of dying thing?  Like some kind of sexist dying thing?  Yeah!  You will not get away with it!  I wish you could just shut your bitch up!  It's Whip-em-out Wednesday!  Ooh-la-la!  Obi and Anthony, N-E-W.  Shut up, stinky.  All right, it's the Obi and Anthony show.  This is Rick, the producer.  Guys are running a little bit late,  but we are not going to do a worse of today.  Maybe they're just running a little bit late. 
[00:00:30]  We're going to throw down a couple of quick things  out of the Obi and Anthony archive,  and then the guys will be live on the air.  So let's get to it with this one.  One of the guys' favorites,  the Egyptian airline pilot.  Obi and Anthony show, 1027, N-E-W.  1027, talk you can't ignore it.  Obi and Anthony!  Nice.  Talking about the Flight 990 stuff.  Now they're saying there's a possibility  that one of the pilots decided to commit suicide. 
[00:01:00]  I kill you!  I kill you!  And bring 216 people with them.  I am starbush!  My tooth, my teeth!  They're killing me!  I'm on crash plane!  Why?  Why?  Why are you doing this to me?  That's just a scary thought.  Yeah, you've got to worry about every other thing that happens.  The weather, mechanical failure, some F-up, 
[00:01:30]  and then you've got a co-pilot that wants to cash it in.  Well, that's what they're thinking at this point.  They can't confirm anything, but that's where they're leading lately.  Putting the information together, that's the conclusion they're drawing.  They want to hand over the case to the FBI, so that's not good news.  Like, what are you going to do, though?  Arrest the guy?  It's done.  Nothing you can do at this point.  Oops.  That's just a scary thought.  I am starbush!  I am pissed off!  I am the Egyptian! 
[00:02:00]  Ah!  First, he said some kind of a prayer about death that they picked up on the tape  and then just put the plane into a nosedive.  Well, first of all, why did the other pilot leave?  They leave every so often.  You've seen it.  Haven't you seen that?  You've been seeing your videos?  I've never seen a pilot walk back.  How are you doing, Dad?  Never seen a pilot leave that cockpit.  He's still got the voice.  Even in the aisle, like he's walking back, you're like,  Hey, look, it's the pilot.  How are you doing?  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll just be walking to the back. 
[00:02:30]  Got to take a leak.  And there's no bathroom up here on the flight deck,  which used to be called the cockpit, but that's a pretty funny word.  Well, you don't look to the rear of the aircraft.  I'll be taking a leak.  And the co-pilot's up there with his Thorazine.  Looking at him.  Should be okay.  You're in capable hands.  But this guy, it seems, was suicidal.  And put the plane into a nosedive.  And the pilot gets back just in time to see him shutting off the engine. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, my goodness.  What are you doing?  And then he, yeah, he's just there, right?  And then he tries to recover.  Pulls back on the stick.  But I guess it was too late.  And then someone shut the engines off.  That's a good thing to do.  I guess.  Who knows?  They say this plane approached the speed of sound before it busted up in that crash.  And now they're saying it could be because the co-pilot was suicidal. 
[00:03:30]  If you're suicidal, please, find a rock, go behind it, blow your brains out or something.  Yeah, don't take out other people, you selfish bastard.  That is selfish.  Selfish, selfish, selfish.  Crawl into a hole.  Do it yourself.  This guy now, if this is true, and he commits suicide and takes along 216 people with him, he's the biggest mass murderer ever.  That's just as bad as going into a place, opening fire, and then shooting yourself in the head.  What's the difference?  Only instead, could you imagine some guy walking into, I don't know, an office building and mowing down 216 people and then shooting himself in the head? 
[00:04:00]  That would be the hugest of huge story.  But it's just a pilot committing suicide or something.  Right.  So it doesn't seem that weird, but it's just as bad.  I mean, just as bad.  This guy took 216 people with him.  Man.  Yeesh.  So they're handing it over to the FBI.  Yeah.  We're going to find out more soon.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to just put the plane into a nosedive. 
[00:04:30]  Enjoy the scenery.  If you look out the port side window, you'll see the wing rip off as we approach the speed of sound.  It'll be pretty exciting for the kids if they want to look out the other side.  The engine just ripped right off.  It's flaming.  That's it.  Well, if you can't see up front, your window's probably blocked by the fuselage skin that's peeling back like a banana peel.  Very exciting sight to see.  Oh, look at the water.  It's coming up pretty quickly.  Get your prayers out of the way. 
[00:05:00]  Anything else?  Maybe you want to jot down a quick note because we're all going to die.  Thank you for flying.  Eat a bear.  Those guys are always under control.  Doesn't matter what.  Doesn't matter what.  I was laughing.  I was watching some dopey movie, that movie about the sharks and stuff that came out.  Deep Blue Sea.  Deep Blue Sea, sure.  And it was the stereotypical chopper pilot.  Chopper pilots, I mean, they're even better than the regular pilots, than airline pilots,  because they are constantly just cool.  No problem. 
[00:05:30]  There is a hurricane that they have to evac people off of this offshore laboratory.  The wind is like 200 miles an hour, rain.  They can't see anything.  The pilot's just like, EPA, five minutes.  And his face is just stomping.  They never like, looks over his co-pilot at one minute and goes,  Holy ****, I can't believe the weather.  We're probably going to die.  Just a little bit.  Let's get those wipers on high.  Look, oh, flaming hail.  I've never seen this before, but I'm sure we could cut right through this. 
[00:06:00]  No problem.  Your stewardess is going to come around with your last meal as we plummet towards the water,  trying not to puke on your pals.  Good thing.  Your family's probably not going to get much more than a finger or anything,  so you don't have to worry about anyone identifying you.  That bang you're going to hear is the sound barrier.  We've just crossed it.  Our stewardess just flew out the back of the plane.  We flew out the back of the plane.  Very exciting for the kids. 
[00:06:30]  Just feel free to crap yourself.  Of course, the no-crapping light has been turned off.  You're free to crap around the cabin.  Tammy, what's going on?  I'm a flight attendant.  You know what the guys do?  What are they doing there?  Okay, the minute that, right after you take off, it goes into autopilot,  and then after it goes to autopilot, they read books.  They read books?  It's all automated now, man.  They read books in every book. 
[00:07:00]  I'm like, what was that?  You know, you watch the movies and stuff, and you see, like, the pilot, you know, okay.  This is the tower.  You're clear to us in to 30,000 feet.  And then he's like, okay.  And you see them, like, pull back on the stick?  That doesn't happen.  They have a dial with the altitude.  They dial it in, push a button, the plane does the rest.  It goes up to 30,000.  And they're just reading books, playing cards.  I read a whole thing on this typical flight from New York to L.A., and the pilot and co-pilot are playing cards. 
[00:07:30]  Cards.  Cards.  Yeah, they're always very calm.  I'm very attentive to what the pilot's saying, too.  And I hate that, because a lot of times the air, like somebody sitting next to you puts the air on so loud that I can't hear it.  So you hear, like, the bing, bing.  I'm like, what are you saying? 
[00:08:00]  What, pilot?  I can't hear you.  Turn the fan off, damn it.  He's talking to me.  And I'm only catching, like, little words that are really alarming me.  I can't hear the pilot. 
[00:08:30]  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, and hey, listen, a year ago I was coming back from Jamaica on their Jamaica place.  And they blew an engine.  And they had the Jamaican guy.  I think he was smoking a spritz in the cockpit.  And they're telling you how to prepare for a crash landing.  Are you serious?  I'm being from Husbandville.  I'm holding hands with their kids, like, praying and crying.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Freaking out the people.  And they put the bar away. 
[00:09:00]  I was like, where's the bar?  That's the time to bring it out.  I'm telling you.  He's nuts.  He's crazy Jamaican.  Yeah, man.  We're going to die.  But we all die together.  We all die, die, die together.  In the flaming crash.  We're going to die together.  Help your kids, everybody.  Smoke a spritz.  Help me.  He's doing this for now.  I've got the big spritz.  Oh, come. 
[00:09:30]  You won't even care.  You're going to be with the spritz.  Spritz full of shoes.  You'll barely feel it when we hit the ground.  Look like a big joint blowing up.  Like a sea that's blowing in a big stock joint.  Is that what we get?  And they tell you, you know, take your shoes off.  Is that why they always find shoes in the water?  I always wonder that.  Like, God, it blew the shoes off.  No, they tell you to take them off.  Yeah, yeah, it's not.  We're buying. 
[00:10:00]  We're buying.  We're buying.  In the flaming crash.  We're buying.  Yeah, we're buying.  We're buying.  That's it.  Look at the wing.  It's covered with bamboo.  Bill.  Hey, how you doing, O'Neill?  Hi, hi.  I got a theory on why that plane crashed.  Okay.  I'm thinking that the pilot had too much slurpee,  and he got a major brain freeze  and just couldn't handle it.  God damn. 
[00:10:30]  I am Tarbash.  I am pissed off.  I am the Egyptian.  The plane went down.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't drink it no more.  That's it, man.  That's it.  Wait.  You're out there.  This is your pilot, Tarbash.  I am going to be cruising about to 30,000 feet. 
[00:11:00]  Have I told you that my life sucks?  My wife, my wife will leave me.  Three camels die.  And I stopped my car walking into Cockpit.  It's very distraught today.  Hello, pilot.  Why don't you go check the back of the plane?  I will stay here and watch.  I will stay here.  No, no.  I haven't even been thinking of turning off autopilot and engines 
[00:11:30]  and sending the plane into a death pipe with supersonic speeds.  I wouldn't even dream of that.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your window,  you will see our 767 engines ripping from the wings.  Don't be alarmed.  Just take your shoes off.  Because that's what you do.  Look.  Oh, as we see the screen of the plane tailback like banana.  Here we go. 
[00:12:00]  Into the water.  Don't worry.  You won't feel a thing.  Oh, my two-turns, I am Tarnas, the Egyptian magician, flying plane.  I am Corky Amar.  I am Corky Amar.  I am Corky Amar.  I am Corky Amar.  I am Corky Amar. 
[00:12:30]  I am Corky Amar.  Thank you.  Booze.  The world's universal language.  I use my breath to get other people's attention.  Whistle at Wednesday!  Obi and Anthony.  The brain is in their pan.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:13:00]  The guys are in the building, believe me.  They'll be here in just a few minutes just finishing up some important stuff.  And they'll be live on the air.  All right?  In the meantime, by O.P.'s request, a little Dice finds God out of the O.N.A. Archive.  1027, W.N.E.W.  Mario!  Watch out, gentlemen.  How are you, Mario?  Yeah, you know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that Dice is one step closer to finding God. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, that was a little weird.  Oh, no.  If that ever happened.  Maybe he'll call the new album out or something.  You know what I mean?  That's the next step.  Could you see Dice doing that?  So I got to tell you about my new personal relationship with Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.  Yeah, I got to change the back of my jacket because I'm now a disciple of Jesus.  You hear me?  And you'll hear the words of Christ. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You know, would that just be too much?  That would be something I would check out if he decided to be like a minister or something.  I'd go to church every Sunday to hear that.  Jesus walked around healing people, wearing a loincloth, so the lepers wouldn't have to look at his yambang.  Okay?  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  So he's walking around.  He sees a leper, you know, and they're like, oh, Jesus, could you cure me?  Yeah, sure.  Slap the nose back on your face. 
[00:14:30]  I'll wave my hand.  You'll be okay.  Hey!  Praise the Lord.  Now, the Lord is our Savior.  I went through a period of my life where I was doing things that maybe the Lord didn't like.  You hear me?  But Jesus is over here now.  Okay?  In my heart.  Jesus is over here now.  It just won't work, man. 
[00:15:00]  Let the Lord say this to you.  Stop your evil ways.  Over here.  Over here.  Okay?  I'm over here now.  My disciple, Club Shutter Kenny, come here.  I found Jesus Christ.  I walk with the Lord now.  Jesus Christ, he's over here now.  In Dice's heart.  Dice would like the Virgin Mary, that's for sure, huh?  Hey, I'm a man of God now. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  I can't be saying things about the Virgin Mary.  No, of course not.  You know, I would have liked to slip her a nice one in the old days.  Because she is a virgin.  Oh!  It was Immaculate Conception, Jesus, with Mary.  Mary never felt the yam bag on her ass.  Immaculate.  Oh, my God.  Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. 
[00:16:00]  Now I found the words of Jesus.  Right.  Christ is my Savior.  No more with the hairy banana.  Now it's a cross.  I do my work with a cross.  I'm touring the country, spreading the word of God.  Did you see that?  Oh, my God.  That would be too friggin' surreal.  Yeah, Jesus is over here now. 
[00:16:30]  Over here now.  Oh, Father, who art in heaven.  Oh!  So, well, you know, in the old days, I might have talked about Moses going to the burning bush and added in something dirty.  But it's a beautiful thing.  I'm walking with Jesus.  You ever see that picture with the footprints in the sand?  Yeah, there's only one set of footprints.  And Jesus walking next to me during the times of my life. 
[00:17:00]  And I say, hey, Jesus, how come during the toughest parts of my life there's only one set of footprints?  Why'd you leave me, you scumbag?  And he said, no, dice, that's when I carried you.  So I broke down crying in tears.  Let me read now from the book of dice.  You need a personal relationship with God. 
[00:17:30]  We're all equal.  The chinks, the colored, the midgets, the whores.  We're all children of God over here.  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  Hallelujah.  Okay?  Okay.  You know, I don't want to be laying there dying over here.  Before I find Jesus.  Before you find Jesus.  Right.  Because Satan does seem like a lot of fun.  I don't want to go through eternity with a pitchfork in my ass. 
[00:18:00]  Okay?  Ow!  A dream, you know, bigger than selling out the garden.  Uh-huh.  Would be Saint Dice.  Okay?  The patron saint of studded leather jackets.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now. 
[00:18:30]  Ow!  I'll be a saint-whack bag of Biscopal church.  I've lost from.  Lamp your jam bags off.  Get out of here, Rick.  Always over the top, Rick.  Stoner Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey.  I learned that in the world, according to Dice, everyone with bad karma is coming back  as a midget with sausage-linked fingers.  But even the midgets are children of God. 
[00:19:00]  See, what I was saying before was bad.  You think when midgets go to heaven, they get small little angel wings?  No, it's not funny.  It's really what I'm thinking.  Jesus, over here now.  I was over there.  Now I'm over here with the Lord.  Just remember the battle cry of the Lord.  Jesus is over here now.  It's about Wednesday.  Oh, man.

[00:24:00]  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Listen, man, what are you guys taking, like,  like, every day is close to the last day?  You're taking, like, a couple hours off,  half an hour off here and there?  Yeah, that's it.  We just decided.  Yeah, that's exactly what happened.  Yeah, then nothing was going on,  so we decided we were just going to hang out  and miss 40 minutes of our show.  Right.  Wait, Opie, I have a birthday present, though, for you.  What's that?  Oh, that's not nice.  The old vacuum gag. 
[00:24:30]  Whew, that's not nice.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Back to the old ways of starting the show at 3.30 again, huh?  Why don't you just stretch Ben's eight minutes into 40 minutes?  All right, all right.  Thank you.  Come on.  We were here.  We were in our office,  just waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.  Yeah.  And then we felt like, okay,  we have to go down the hall now and do the show.  Time to do the show.  Right.  Come on.  We're kind of getting like the Guns N' Roses attitude.  Is that just leaving the audience waiting? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, we just weren't ready to, you know, hit the stage.  Then we come out,  and if Ben, like, burns his hand on a flash pot,  we don't even come out early to cover for him.  Right.  Is that it?  I once went to a Guns N' Roses show,  had to wait three hours because Axl wasn't feeling it.  Three hours?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, believe me.  Three hours.  He would probably love to make up all those hours now.  Right.  That no one really cares.  Well, we'll be on the air for, hopefully, for the rest of the show. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  I don't know.  Someone's poking their head in already.  Oh, really?  We'll just continue, business as usual,  and we'll see what happens.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, Anthony, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  We all know that.  It's just cold and rainy and miserable out there.  It's a nasty wow day.  People feeling a little blue, feeling a little down.  Yeah.  So, ladies, you know,  you hold the key for a little pick-me-up today.  Perk them up with your perkies.  If you're feeling it,  please flash your fellow drivers today on the way home from work, okay? 
[00:26:00]  It really helps out on the commute.  It really, really does.  A lot of guys out there have the wows on their cars already.  You know, you can get the wow stickers through the self-addressed stamped envelope thing.  Or show up at the sticker stop.  Yeah, where is the sticker stop today?  Earl's at Monmouth Cycles.  That's 656 Highway 35 in Middletown, New Jersey.  Did that make any sense to anyone?  What? 
[00:26:30]  Who, what?  No, and I'm not even trying to be a deke.  It's Monmouth Cycles, 656 Highway 35.  Okay.  656 Highway 35 in Middletown, New Jersey.  Earl should be there for at least another hour.  So if you're in the area, stop by and, you know, grab the famous wow bumper sticker, okay?  Yes.  All right.  Frank, what's going on?  Just wanted to find out what you guys were in court for today.  No, no court.  No court date.  No court. 
[00:27:00]  I'm just busting shops.  Hey, I was out of town last week.  What were you in court for last Wednesday?  I never heard that story.  I was in court.  I got my situation.  All right, all right, all right.  Sorry for being a moron.  No biggie.  You know that your situation is taking longer than Ted Turner's situation?  Yeah, I know.  It hit the paper today that he's done.  It's over.  He's done.  Done.  Yeah.  And you know when that proceeding started?  When?  January 2000.  Nice.  See?  What a load.  And I think they had a lot more stake in that relationship.  I think so. 
[00:27:30]  For some reason, this just goes on and on.  I read that in the paper today.  I thought, Anthony must be pulling his hair out today.  I just, Ted Turner's situation took less time than yours to finish.  I'm just, I've just accepted it as part of my life that'll just be there forever.  Like the herp or something, you know?  He'll live with it.  Just deal with it.  It's like herpes.  I just don't want it to keep spreading, though.  Right.  Right?  Oh. 
[00:28:00]  My God.  Stop holding up all these little cute signs that we can't read.  Relax.  Ah, good.  The coffee's here.  We need that severe today.  Whew.  A shot of Sambuca would be nice on that coffee.  Oh, please.  Right about now.  I wish the guys from Motley Crue were here today.  I'd take some of the dope that they probably had.  How cool were they?  Very cool yesterday.  Oh, by the way.  Yeah, we had Vince and Nicky in here from Motley Crue.  Their book is great.  They had a book signing, so they came in to say hi before the book signing. 
[00:28:30]  The book's called The Dirt.  You heard us talking about it yesterday, I'm sure.  Yeah, great book.  One of the listeners, though, we have to tell this on the air.  What?  We're trying to get Nicky in trouble.  Oh, that's right.  Nicky's wife got an email.  Yeah.  That he was here in the studio and there was a porn star in there and, you know, she was  doing things with a wiffle ball bat.  Nicky was watching with everybody else here in the studio. 
[00:29:00]  He didn't participate.  But someone out there knows Nicky's wife.  Yeah.  Send a little email.  You should hear what your husband's doing right now.  Mm-hmm.  He wasn't doing anything.  No.  Nothing.  He was here in the show and we had that porn star in yesterday.  Is that what her name?  Jewel of denial.  Jewel.  Jewel denial.  Jewel denial.  Right.  And, yeah, she did the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Came in a respectable third.  And everybody was watching. 
[00:29:30]  It wasn't like he brought her with him.  But somebody's ratting him out.  Someone out there told on Nicky from Motley Crue.  Isn't that ridiculous?  And he did nothing.  That sucks.  Jesus.  And with the past he has, you know.  Oh, I know.  She's not going to believe that.  I know.  But I'm telling you right now, nothing happened with Nicky.  Nothing went on.  Yesterday in the studio.  Who is the rat, though?  Who would fire off an email to the guy's wife?  Who's got her email address?  I don't know.  Kenny, what's going on? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Listen, I was driving down the highway today.  I drive a truck for a living.  And I drive along.  I see this girl pull up next to me.  She's got a leg up on a dashboard.  She's wearing a nice black dress and everything.  And I take a quick look, close her up.  And she's got, she doesn't have no panties on.  She's sitting there rubbing herself.  All right.  Hold on.  I don't know if they'll let that through, unfortunately.  Power up. 
[00:30:30]  So, Kenny, basically she was petting the poodle.  Yeah, exactly.  She was petting the poodle.  And I'm sitting there looking at her.  And she slows down to stay with my truck.  And she sits down and looks dead at me and starts smiling and everything.  Starts going a little faster at it.  Right, right, right.  Oh, man.  I definitely made my day, man.  I'm so happy I got that wow on the back of my truck, man.  Cool.  I don't get to see any of that stuff.  I couldn't believe it, man.  I've been driving the truck for two and a half years. 
[00:31:00]  And this is the second time.  One time out in Peppelin, another time.  All right, Kenny.  Wow.  Thank you, Kenny.  All right, guys.  Thanks.  Oh, my man.  Oh, my God.  That's not helping.  Marion, what's going on?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Oh, it's that, Marion.  Hey, Opie.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks for the card, by the way.  Oh, thank you, guys.  Opie, why would you thank her for the card when you ripped it up and threw it in the garbage?  No, he didn't rip up the card, Anthony.  Stop saying that.  Um, okay.  That's because we didn't send you guys a card. 
[00:31:30]  What?  We didn't send you a card for your birthday.  Thank God.  Because we forgot until that day.  Very good.  I'm glad.  But I just want to wish you a happy birthday, Opie.  I got a card from you and your freak of nature friend there.  Oh, okay.  You got hers, too?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  We hope to see you guys soon.  All right.  Hey, guys, any word about the softball game yet, or?  What did you say, Marion?  Any word?  I love that.  All right.  We're trying to never get sold.  We'll play a little catch-up, so we've got to take another quick break here, okay? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, because we weren't in the studio promptly.  God.  212-757-1027.  Break it down.  It's please, wow.  We love seeing boobs.  It's please, wow.  You love it.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everybody can run around the street.  They'll close up.  Rip them, huh?  How do you do?  A brilliant idea.  There's a cure for cancer.  You're an injury.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Anthony. 
[00:32:30]  Come on, man.  You're making, Opie.  It's BMW Films, Anthony.  Ah, we love BMW Films.  Wait, that mic works over there.  I'm making my coffee.  BMW Films has a new website that is showing cool new short films made especially for Internet viewing.  The website is bmwfilms.com.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you should.  But it's definitely a very, very good concept from these guys from BMW.  Right in.  That's right, Opie. 
[00:33:00]  What they did, BMW Films, they snagged some of the hottest directors to make these really cool short films.  We've liked all the films they've shown us so far.  Yeah, it's a great idea.  They're short films.  How long would you say they are?  About five minutes long?  Yeah, no more than ten.  And it's all action.  And they really did a great job with these because it's like a major motion picture action scene in five minutes.  Right.  Car chases, gunfights, really creative.  I think you'll love them.  BMWfilms.com.  Right now you can check out Chosen, directed by Ang Lee. 
[00:33:30]  He was the guy that did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Sense and Sensibility in the Ice Storm.  Hey!  We really liked that one.  The car chase scene was unbelievable.  Yeah, pretty good.  Also got a star directed by Guy Ritchie.  Madonna's squeeze.  Yeah, those are the films coming up.  Star by Guy Ritchie.  Powder keg directed by Alejandro González Inghierrito.  Cool films, hot directors on BMWfilms.com.  Starting tomorrow, Thursday, Anthony, you can see The Follow, directed by Wong Kar Wai. 
[00:34:00]  Wai what?  Wong Kar Wai.  He directed Fallen Angels and won the Best Directed Prize at the Cannes Film Festival for his 1997 film, Happy Together.  Check out his work on IBM.  IBM?  Holy ass.  BMWfilms.com.  BMWfilms.com.  BMWfilms.com.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island. 
[00:34:30]  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  It's the ONA show.  Phone number 212-757-1027.  What's that?  Got to remind the folks in Monmouth.  Actually, Middletown, New Jersey, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're doing a wild figure stop with Earl right now as we speak at Monmouth Cycle, 656 Highway 35 in Middleton, New Jersey. 
[00:35:00]  Monmouth.  Monmouth.  We just got blown off by Richard Belzer.  Whatever.  Yeah.  That was cute.  We didn't ask him on the show.  He was out in our lobby.  Nah.  Nah.  But Steve asked him to cut an ID for our show.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  I'm good at it. 
[00:35:30]  Thanks.  I'm not really familiar with their show.  I'm not hip to the show.  Dad.  Back.  Oh, well.  I don't know if we can move on with our video.  I know.  Show.  Very, very.  Knowing nothing.  Screw him.  And then his agent said something to his manager.  Said something to Steve.  Like, why'd you ask him?  And Steve, you know, he's, you know, he's usually aligned with someone else. 
[00:36:00]  So why'd you ask him?  And Steve goes, that's exactly why I did ask him.  Nah.  Nah, not bad.  Nah.  I'm Anthony.  Not bad.  Nah.  Yeah.  Everyone talking about Pearl Harbor.  Yeah.  Pearl Harbor, babe.  Don't know it.  Haven't heard of it.  What's Pearl Harbor, babe?  Can't do that.  No.  Aligned with someone else.  No.  Can't do it, babe.  Nice head, Steve.  Everyone talking about Pearl Harbor.  Pearl Harbor coming out this weekend. 
[00:36:30]  What, Friday?  Yeah, Friday.  Yeah.  I mean, the preview, we've all seen it.  Looks just amazing.  Seen the trailers, but now I'm getting scared.  I'm getting scared because now they're starting to change the trailers a little, which makes this look like a cleverly disguised chick flick.  Oh, good God.  Chick flick.  A la Titanic, which was cool to watch because of the ship sinking.  Is it Titanic with plants?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  It's Titanic, but instead of the iceberg, it's nips.  Japs.  Whatever you want to call them.  Slanty eyes.  Gooks.  Now, they didn't call them gooks back then.  The derogatory terms during World War II were nips and japs.  Bugs Bunny called them nips, right?  And japs.  And japs.  I think Gaffey called them japs during the wartime propaganda cartoon.  The japs are coming.  You know?  It's kind of funny when you see a cartoon saying it.  Whenever you see Hitler in a cartoon, it's really funny. 
[00:37:30]  Funny.  They call them krauts, too.  Krauts.  Krauts were the Germans.  Hold on.  Tommy has something.  I don't get this.  Tommy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Is it pretty safe to say Gilbert Gottfried's not going to be cutting one of your promos either?  Yes.  No.  No.  God, the revenge of the...  I can't go on that show.  The revenge of the bad 90s comics.  Pathetic.  Pathetic.  I don't know if we could do a radio show without having Gilbert on.  Oh, that stinks.  Why did you ask me?  Shut up.  Yeah, babe.  Watch out, babe.  No.  No. 
[00:38:00]  Anyway, Anthony.  Jack off.  So, there's a few things going on with this Pearl Harbor.  Jack off.  Me and those are going.  First of all, you're starting to think that it might be a cleverly disguised chick flick a la Titanic.  They have a love story going on.  Because now I hear it's all friggin' love story.  You get a good chunk of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  And then back to the love story.  Back to love.  We all know how long the attack on Pearl Harbor lasted, so they're going to have to fill some time.  I know.  All right. 
[00:38:30]  Here come the Japs.  A few torpedoes drop.  A few bombs.  A few ships sink.  Back to Ben Affleck in love.  Yes.  Get in a coffin.  Good.  So, that's one concern about the movie.  Yeah.  The other is the fact that they got a carrier.  Yeah.  This is interesting.  For the premiere.  The movie premiere.  It's a Disney movie.  It's going to be at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. 
[00:39:00]  So, what they do?  They get an aircraft carrier to serve as an outdoor theater for the stars to show up for the premiere.  Oh.  How much is that costing?  Just a couple mil, probably.  A couple mil?  Do you know what it costs to move an aircraft carrier?  It's astounding, the cost to move an aircraft carrier.  To use it so some celebrities can watch a goddamn movie on the deck. 
[00:39:30]  Because it's not just a carrier.  There's a whole carrier group of destroyers and minesweepers and all kinds of support ships that travel with any aircraft carrier.  It's never just alone.  So, all of that has to go from where it was or where it might have been best used to show a goddamn movie for celebrities at Pearl Harbor.  And you know who's footing the bill?  You think Disney's paying it?  No.  Check your paycheck on Friday. 
[00:40:00]  Look at federal withholding tax.  That's what's paying for this premiere.  So, Courtney Love can sit on the deck of an aircraft carrier and watch a movie.  You're going to pay for it.  That's it.  You're paying for it.  And then the third thing about Pearl Harbor is how they're kind of changing things around for the overseas release.  This is unbelievable.  This is going to be released in Japan. 
[00:40:30]  Now, Disney loves Japan because Disney movies always do well in Japan.  They send it over there after the release.  I think mid-July it's going over to Japan, Pearl Harbor.  Japs love Disney.  Japs love the Disney movies.  They love it.  They just love Disney.  Yeah.  We love a Disney.  Rub it.  And they're editing small parts of the movie.  So, in a way, they're changing history.  Yeah.  No, they're not so much changing it as just leaving it out a little bit. 
[00:41:00]  Well, that's changing history a little bit.  Here's what the concern was.  They said that some Japanese groups were up in arms and getting pissed at Pearl Harbor because at the end of the movie,  there's this little speech that someone gives about what happened after the attack.  After, as they say in the movie, the cowardly attack from the Japanese and how they bombed Pearl Harbor without a provocation or without a declared war. 
[00:41:30]  And they're cutting that out because, get this, the Japanese groups were concerned that the movie would make the Japanese look like,  you're listening, look like the bad guys.  They were the bad guys.  The Japanese look like the bad guys.  You know, time ticks on.  They were cowardly bad guys.  Time ticks on and people just forget.  They forget that we hated them. 
[00:42:00]  Hated them.  There's a scene in the movie that was clipped out of Jimmy Doolittle saying that he was going to,  if his plane was shot or running out of fuel over Japan, he was going to dive bomb into civilians.  You know something?  That was the mindset back then.  That's what happened.  Why do you think we dropped two A-bombs?  We hated them. 
[00:42:30]  Because they were the bad guys.  They were the bad.  You don't drop two A-bombs on the good guys.  They were the bad guys.  That was the perception back then.  And when you edit stuff out of a movie to placate a group of Japanese that are upset that they were bad guys.  Did you just use the word placate?  Yes.  Why?  I love that word.  I like that word.  It's not used enough on our radio show.  Thank you.  To placate.  I'm trying to up the ante.  I hope I used it right.  Yeah, like the Patriots. 
[00:43:00]  The Brits were upset that they were looking like the bad guys.  Well, you know, back then, from the American side, they were the bad guys.  In a war, I think one side thinks the other side is the bad guys.  If the Japanese want to make their own Pearl Harbor, guess who would be the bad guy?  Us.  We would.  Because they bombed us.  Because we were the bad guys.  Patrick, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I love the show.  Thank you.  I got some inside information for you. 
[00:43:30]  I work at a movie theater up in Westchester, and we got the prints today.  We got two prints.  And I just have some inside information for you.  The total running time with trailers is going to be three hours and ten minutes.  Wow.  Longer than the bombing.  Longer than...  I heard the actual movie is going to be two and a half hours.  Yeah, but, you know, with the trailers and all the promos, it's three ten.  Plus, all right, the bombing is only 40 minutes, right? 
[00:44:00]  In real life, it took place over two hours.  Yeah.  Right?  So...  Yeah, but I can handle 40 minutes of that.  Right.  I know.  That'd be awesome.  I'll just walk in for the attack and then leave.  Oh, definitely.  Patrick, do us a favor and tell us when the action sequence with the planes flying in and  stuff, how long into the movie that is going on.  That's going on for about...  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I don't need abouts.  I need an exact time.  So I can walk down the hill to my little theater at that exact moment, check out the bombing, 
[00:44:30]  and leave 40 minutes later.  Oh, man, I'll give you the inside information.  No, no, no.  No problem.  All right.  Don't you think the Japs would like a movie like Pearl Harbor, though?  I mean, it really shows them kicking our ass.  Yeah.  It really does.  They're probably praising it.  They probably got the reels up on the hill somewhere.  They're like, oh, this is our prince.  This is our...  Yeah.  We're going to throw them out.  Yeah.  It's wonderful because I hated that movie A Midway.  That's a very bad movie.  Yeah, and it didn't to Reich. 
[00:45:00]  And it's totally a Titanic.  It's going to be like two and a half hours of this love story and then just 40 minutes  of bombing.  Yeah.  And then it's going to go back to the love story because they have to, you know, because  Ben Affleck has to go back to stupid Kate Beckinsale.  If this is like the English patient, where in the trailer they showed some cool fighting,  you know, fighting, planes and stuff, and then what was the English patient?  Severe chick flick with a few grenades.  It's totally going to be a chick flick, and it's going to be the biggest flop of the summer. 
[00:45:30]  Well, we'll see.  All right?  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  I love it.  Oh, sorry about that.  Diana, what's going on?  I know a movie theater owner.  Yeah.  And he says that it's all love story.  He's seen the whole thing.  Oh.  God.  I swear I am just going in for the bombing.  Just going in for the bombing.  I don't know how long it takes to go into the bombing, but he said that there is very,  very little action.  It's almost all love story.  Look, the action is going to be action.  I'm not going to go that far.  I've seen the trailers, the bombing stuff. 
[00:46:00]  The whole attack looks fantastic.  He said, oh, that's cool, but there's not that much of it.  There's 40 minutes is what I hear.  So I'll pay.  I'll pay the nine, ten bucks, go in, watch a 40-minute movie, and leave.  All right, Diana.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See you later.  All right.  Let's go to Butch, who's next on 1027 WNAW.  Butch, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, listen.  You know, Anthony's totally right.  How can they be upset about being the bad guys?  Of course they were the bad guys.  People like revising history. 
[00:46:30]  You know what I mean?  They don't like, that's the way it was.  There's no change in it now.  To just cover it up is ridiculous.  It doesn't mean it didn't happen.  It doesn't mean that they weren't the enemy and hated and looked upon like scum, like animals.  We wanted every Jap wiped off the face of Japan and the face of the earth.  They were horrid.  They were cruel, horrid fighters.  And that's what it was back then. 
[00:47:00]  Sure.  Now, God damn, I love my Sony DVD player.  I love that those little sons of bitches can make a DVD player the side of a little paperback book.  And know why?  God bless them.  You know why they can make all that fine stuff?  Because we gave them brand new factories.  Wartime reparations.  That's why.  That's right.  Abso-effing-lutely.  Old Dougie McArthur went over there and set things straight.  Jim Norton has arrived.  Hi.  Norton, how do you feel about the Japs?  We're talking about the Japs. 
[00:47:30]  We're talking about the Pearl Harbor.  The whole movie coming out and how the Japs are pissed off.  And I'm calling them Japs to keep in the whole mood of the movie.  Slopes would be fine too.  Well, that was later on.  The slope is more Southeast Asia term.  Yeah, I like nips.  Nip.  Nip was a fun word.  Zipperhead.  But now the Japs are pissed off that they're being portrayed as the bad guys in this movie.  They were the bad.  Of course they were.  Right.  Savages.  And that's how they were perceived and that's how, regardless if it was a propaganda also, 
[00:48:00]  that was the perception.  Right.  And that's how it was back then.  John, what's going on?  Oh, okay.  That was good.  If they want to make a movie that'll perceive us as bad guys, make a movie about a submarine  that surfaces under your fishing boat.  That would be a great one.  Tom on line seven is panicking.  Stop talking about the movie.  Don't give away the ending.  Oh, you idiot.  Matt, you're next on WNAW.  Yeah, quick.  What did I learn?  I just learned that we retaliated against the Japanese by holding up signs at the C-word 
[00:48:30]  outside of their news windows.  Very good.  Talk to you later, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Do we have to...  Tony, go ahead real fast.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I saw the movie.  How did you see it?  It was a press screening yesterday and Lowe's at 44th.  Now, don't give...  I'm not going to give anything away.  Don't give your opinion of the movie because people are freaking out.  Obviously, a ton of people are going to see this movie this weekend.  No, it's fine.  I'll keep it short.  But what a can of cheese, okay? 
[00:49:00]  Can of cheese?  Yeah, Velveeta.  It was super slow-mo, unrealistic love gook with gunfire.  God damn it.  I hate that.  You know?  But let me say this.  The action sequences were phenomenal.  That's it?  Fantastic.  I mean, that was the only reason to go pay money for it.  Yeah.  Which I didn't, which is why I liked it.  I'd be more than happy paying a movie admission price for a 40-minute movie.  I got no problem with that.  If they cut it down to it, I'd say go right ahead, but they didn't.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Cool.  The second I hear climb Mount Nataki, I'm in. 
[00:49:30]  And then once those two, the last battleship sinks, I'm out.  Out.  Frank.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I could...  Has anybody forgot the Rape of Nan King, the Bataan Death March?  Yeah, those fun things.  Christ.  It wasn't quite...  You know, I'm sure there were some real bad sons of bitches on the United States Army back then  that would just do horrific things.  But as far as wholesale slaughter and cruelty go, I mean, it's known that the Japanese would  treat the prisoners just horrendous. 
[00:50:00]  The Nazis treated their prisoners, not the people in concentration camps.  I'm talking like the war prisoners.  They would treat them much better than the Japanese did.  The Nazis were like 12 men.  It was horrendous, the way they treated soldiers, prisoners.  And now, you know, time goes by, and because we're such a politically correct nation, you  can't throw in things like, you know, the cowardly attack by the Japanese.  It's a war. 
[00:50:30]  By the way, Anthony, this just in from Ken from Connecticut.  I saw Extra last night.  They said it cost over $5 million to use that ship for the premiere.  $5 million.  Five million.  Nice.  Earl wants to say hi really fast.  Earl.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Earl.  Yo.  I'll bite.  What's the word on the street?  Well, we went on the street.  We were here at Mama Cycles, which is 656 Highway 35 in Middletown, New Jersey.  All right.  The best way to get here is to take exit 117. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  All right up the Garden State Parkway, and then take that to Highway 35.  As you can hear, we've got a couple of people here already, blocking traffic and raising hell.  And we're going to be here for the next hour giving out WoW stickers.  I just find it funny that the guy who can't find his own house is giving directions to the WoW sticker stop.  Yeah, he doesn't know where his own house is.  Well, I didn't know it at the time because I don't drive, guys.  You heard it here first. 
[00:51:30]  Earl, it didn't.  I don't know.  It's kind of a sensitive subject with our own, Earl.  But there were two times that Earl couldn't find his own house.  Right, Earl?  Because I don't drive.  Jesus Christ.  Then?  Twice.  Twice we ended up at JFK in the middle of the night.  I don't know where I am.  Take me to a train.  You had someone who was extremely high driving, so that didn't help at all.  No, but he didn't have to know where he was going.  All he had to know was turn right here, turn left here. 
[00:52:00]  Go straight.  Go through this lake.  It's all right, Earl.  But you having fun down there?  Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of people here.  All right, cool.  So it's a...  It's getting out in the rain.  It's great.  People are checking out the bikes.  We're having a good time.  And where is it again?  Marmot's Cycle.  You better tell him, Opie.  Well, our sticker stop is at Marmot's Cycle, 656 Highway, 35 in Middletown, New Jersey.  Opie?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Tim is a little upset.  He goes, Anthony, where did you get your information about Germans treating their POWs?  Hogan's Heroes?  Now, yes, I did.  In the German POW camps, you were able to leave through the big tree stump, and all you needed  was a little disguise, and you hung out with Fraulein's in the bar.  As long as you made it back before roll call.  But even that was okay, because Schultz was really cool.  And you give him a chocolate bar or a strudel that the little French guy made, and you're in.  So, yeah, that is exactly where I got my POW information.  Hogan's Heroes, the wacky SS guy. 
[00:53:00]  Major Hochstetter.  He rolled.  Mark, what's going on?  Hogan's Heroes.  Mark.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Excellent.  I met you guys up in Boston.  You're a Boston guy.  Yeah, I was down in Jersey doing some work, and I saw a bumper sticker with a wow on it.  I said, wow, open to Anthony.  I was like, oh my God, I met you guys in the afternoon.  Oh, cool.  So, what do you think of Coney playing for the Sox?  Oh, man. 
[00:53:30]  What a...  I feel so bad for Cone, man, David Cone.  Does Coney need the money that bad?  I mean, I think we can chip in and give him a few bucks.  He couldn't even fake it on the speech he was giving.  At the press conference, they're like, hey, how does it feel being in a Red Sox uniform?  He goes, well, it's a nice uniform.  Nice looking uniform.  Nice looking uniform.  It's cloth, which is good.  They measure me well.  It's a good fit. 
[00:54:00]  Good fit.  Good fit.  My Sox uniform.  Yeah, it's good.  Wait, could I take a second from this press conference?  Someone please kill me.  Someone please kill me.  Do you honestly think Coney wants to be a Red Sox guy?  A sock?  A bow sock?  A blow sock?  I know, Ben.  They've beaten us in all the series.  Whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Whatever.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Back, back, back. 
[00:54:30]  Wait until the end of the evening.  Last time they won a World Series, Hitler was five.  Right.  Come on.  Wait, is that real?  I don't know, but it's probably close.  You know what?  One of our listeners will do the research.  Let's just try a little longer.  We'll get Hitler's age when the Red Sox won the World Series.  I think Hitler was playing for the song.  All right, Mark.  Then they won.  Good talking to you, man.  You're the dog guy.  All right.  That poor son of a bitch.  Man, he's just like, yeah?  No, it's...  Oh, I'm very excited to be a member of the Red Sox. 
[00:55:00]  Uniform's comfy.  It's good.  It's cool.  It breathes.  It's cotton.  Poor Coney.  Oh.  You got to think he'd put his...  Yeah, but why continue your career?  Yeah.  It wasn't like he was lining them up.  No.  Yeah.  No.  He had nothing left in his arm and decided to keep going with his career.  George, please save me.  Why don't you do this?  Yeah, I heard that we were trying to get stole for him.  Lady Di.  Yes.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jim.  Hi.  How you guys doing? 
[00:55:30]  Opie, I called to say happy birthday to you.  Are you there?  What?  Hello?  How are you playing the sound?  We came on me or what?  Oh, I'm a fool.  Opie, I just called to say happy birthday.  Always funny.  All right, we got to take a break.  Jim Norton's hanging with us today.  Yeah.  Always funny.  Norton!  One of our soldiers.  And Colonel Klink was such a nice commandant of Starlight 13. 
[00:56:00]  Like, he could catch him in a blatant spying or sabotage, and it would be okay.  Yeah, because Hogan would always have something on him.  Hogan!  You know, but it was okay.  No one ever got put against the wall and shot.  Those Germans knew how to drink their POW.  Rich has a comment about Cone and Taylor before we move on.  Rich.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey. 
[00:56:30]  No, the whole thing with Cone, it's kind of like, you know, going out for a check with  a little while, having a good time, breaking up with a hug, getting pissed, and going to  ask some guy you hate.  All right, wait, wait.  No, hold on.  Not accurate.  All right, I'll go with it a little bit.  This is what I'll tell you.  When Cone went to the Yankees being a Mets fan, it was like, son of a bitch.  You know, this girl broke up with me, and now she's banging this popular guy.  But now with Cone on the Red Sox, now it looks like, you know, the girlfriend got her, got  a drug problem, and now she's hanging out with the Yankee guys. 
[00:57:00]  That's it.  Okay?  Right.  Well, the drug problem is what he had with the Mets.  Huh?  He had the drug problem with the Mets.  No, no, because he was going to the Yankees.  Going to the Yankees.  He killed me, because he still had a lot left in his arm, so I'm like, holy ass.  You know, she, let's make believe Cone's the chick, you know, she left me to bang this  really popular guy that everyone loves.  Right, the Yankees.  The Yankees.  But then, you know, this girlfriend, now she's not really wanted anymore, so it's not 
[00:57:30]  like you're hung up on this chick.  She's all effed out.  And the hard part is when she went to the popular guy, she banged him well.  Right.  Yeah, she did.  Right.  Really well.  Then she got all effed out, and now you're the Yankees.  She cones your chick that you don't want around anymore that's all effed out.  Now she's out with the, you know, the guy that pedals the bike and delivers pizza.  You send her to the dirt bag with your fluid leaking out of every one of her holes.  Right.  And he's obviously not happy with the new guy, but it's over, John. 
[00:58:00]  All right, Red.  All right.  Thank you.  Who's that girl outside the studio?  That's David Cone.  Huh?  Trying to get back.  Cone.  Wait a minute.  That's the girl that wants to do the...  What does she want to do?  Lesbian for a day.  Lesbian for a day?  Lesbian for a day.  What?  What?  Wait. 
[00:58:30]  Bang.  What?  What's the matter?  What's wrong?  You see how hot this girl is?  She wants to be a lesbian for a day?  Anthony knows all about this.  You, we've been telling you, and you're like...  She wanted to come in and be a lesbian for a day?  I thought she was like...  She looked like a Playboy centerfold.  So, ladies, here's the words out for you right now.  Right now.  If you want to be a lesbian for a day...  All right, we'll go with it.  If you're a girl and you wanted to have a lesbian experience...  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Wait a minute.  Who are you? 
[00:59:00]  You're Celeste from yesterday?  From yesterday?  No.  Or a couple days ago?  No.  It's my first day.  It's her first day she's been on the show.  No, I know...  But you called us, right?  No.  What?  Well, tell me what's going on.  What are you on?  Are you on crack?  Opium.  We've been talking about this.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  We've been talking about this.  Hot Celeste.  Hi, I'm Celeste.  I am so effing lost. 
[00:59:30]  This is the...  This is...  This is the girl we wanted to bring in because a lesbian for a day.  Right.  And she was going to teach the other girls...  I'm the lesbian.  Right.  Didn't we talk to you on the air?  No.  No.  Then how did we...  Did you send an email?  No, Pleasure Productions did.  Oh, the...  Oh, okay.  Is it all coming back to you, Opium?  Not really.  Right.  And...  Someone gave you a roofie.  Ben took care of it on Monday and Tuesday.  What?  Ben took care of it on Monday and Tuesday, said everything was set, but you were all go. 
[01:00:00]  Someone gave you a roofie.  Anthony, you explain what's going on.  I am so...  This is the last...  I understand what you want to do.  It's been lined up.  I've heard from Rick and Ben about this.  I don't know the details of how it was lined up, but I knew that this was happening.  Okay.  But didn't we talk to a girl yesterday or the day before that wanted to come in and do this?  No.  I'm thinking there's two different things going on here.  Maybe there was another girl that wanted to do this, but it's not her that called up. 
[01:00:30]  Look, Opie, here's a gift horse.  Look everywhere but its mouth.  Okay?  Take a look.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the ass.  The flat stomach.  Never look in the mouth.  Got it?  Look in the mouth, Opie.  Look in the mouth.  I have a feeling she's going to go, I want to touch you.  I want to touch you.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  But we need girls now.  We need girls, budding lesbian girls, that want to come down with a beautiful girl that 
[01:01:00]  will get on the lesbian couch with you.  Yeah.  Describe yourself.  I mean, you're tall.  I'm tall.  I'm 5'10".  Right.  I'm really exotic.  She's got the exotic look going on.  But not bizarre exotic.  No, let me tell you.  Nice exotic.  Exotic could be bizarre.  Because, you know, who's that chick that was in the James Bond movie and the stuff?  Who is that girl?  The black chick. 
[01:01:30]  Grace Jones.  Grace Jones.  She's got an exotic look.  No, that's just...  Woo!  That's exotic alien exotic.  This girl's a female version of Grace Jones.  No, very lovely.  Just a joke.  She's beautiful.  What are your measurements?  Thank you.  34 C, 23, 36, 5'10".  Jim, calm down.  Right.  I have long hair, almost got my butt.  And you'll get into some lesbian stuff with some girls?  Oh, I love girls. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, we got something in common.  Yeah.  Nice.  Just bring me girls.  All right.  Just bring me a dress and I'll protect you.  All right.  Ladies.  The first time.  Ladies.  Ladies, ladies, ladies.  We are begging you.  Yeah.  If you're close to the station and if you want to be a lesbian for a day with just a major piece of ass.  It's not a slob.  No.  It's not like you're going to come up here and have to get on a lesbian cafe and go,  Oh, I came up in good faith and stuff.  If you're a budding lesbian or you're thinking about it, you're curious about it, 
[01:02:30]  this is your day now.  Finally make it happen.  This is the Vanessa Williams of lesbian.  Right.  You got a little Vanessa Williams in her.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The young Vanessa Williams.  Yeah.  Jim, you all right?  You're very, very attractive.  You liking it?  Very much so.  Cool.  Yeah.  So, ladies, call now.  Yes.  Call now.  Can we check out the rest of your body or no?  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Or just come down.  Oh, let's check out her body first.  For the birthday boy.  All right.  Oh, wow.  It's my birthday, too. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  It was his birthday.  Very nice.  It's Norton's birthday.  Nice.  Jim, what do you think of those?  I'm leaking clear stuff.  Really nice.  I don't know what that means.  Don't dump out.  Beautiful.  Right.  I need some girls to come play with them.  Ah.  Those, that's, wow, yeah.  That's what she's holding when she says that.  Her bowling ball.  Right.  Stinky, what's up?  Woo.  Those are perfect.  A Stinky Woo.  You got a Woo from Stinky.  Stinky Woo.  That's good.  And he lives with a gay pedophile, so that's.  All right.  Why don't we have a girl on the phone yet? 
[01:03:30]  What are you waiting for, ladies?  Here's your chance.  This is it.  We always hear from girls that go, I want to be a lesbian.  I want to try it.  Maybe they need the phone number, Anthony.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Give it out again, just in case they just said, oh, phone number, what?  Yeah, and you got to be close to the station.  We only have two and a half hours left in the show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Are we going to do some Stinky Cam and things like that?  Yes.  Let me fire this up and see if it works now.  I sure hope it works now. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, let's get.  Because we've been having some problems.  Let's get her on the Stinky Cam immediately.  Ozzy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  What's up, Jim?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Hey, have you guys seen the MPEG of the kickboxer getting his leg broken?  Saw it today.  Holy S.  Did you faint?  Almost.  I started screaming.  I mean, it doesn't take much to freak us out.  That one freaked me out.  But I got it as an email, and the person didn't send me a warning or anything.  Yeah.  And the thing just starts playing, and then he tries to stand on it, and he falls over. 
[01:04:30]  He goes for a kick.  I guess he was kicking him in the hip, I guess, right?  Like, I think they hit shins.  Yeah, and his leg just comes apart right between the knee and the ankle to move.  And then he tries to stand on it and just flops.  Steve, you're going to go put that on foundrymusic.com?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll do it within the next either hour or I'll do it tonight.  Yeah, it'll be on the home page there, the first page.  All right?  All right.  Thanks, Ozzy.  You guys rock.  Have you seen it yet?  No. 
[01:05:00]  All right, we've got to show you that clip.  Why do I get error communicating with server?  And I've gotten this for the longest time, and people have been bitching us out that we've  had stuff going on here, and we don't have the stinky cam working.  And I've let it be known.  See?  Error communicating with server.  Webcam stopped.  Stay like this.  Mm-mm.  Unacceptable.  Unacceptable.  Samantha.  Hello.  Someone should talk to Scott immediately, because the guy's got to see this lovely lady.  Samantha.  Yeah?  Do you have a question for her?  Yeah.  Would she make out with a black girl? 
[01:05:30]  What?  Would she make out with a black girl?  Why not?  Of course.  You look a little...  She's got a little something in there.  What's going on?  Can't you tell me what she looks like?  Yeah, what do you look like?  They say I look like Trina, the rapper.  Trina.  Most rap girls have big asses.  And they're a little skanky.  And they like to wear plastic bags.  Of course I do.  But I've never been with a girl before.  Where are you?  In Jersey.  How dark are you?  How dark? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I'm like light-skinned.  You're not like Mickey Rivers black, are you?  No.  What's wrong, Jim?  Mickey Rivers.  Most awful glider.  My best eye.  No, because I like a certain shade of black, Jim.  Like, she's a little too light.  Yeah?  Yeah, a little.  You think so?  Like, I'm going to be picky.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.  I'm like a cafe latte type, you know?  What goes on in our lesbian couch?  Lots of stuff.  Anything you girls want to do.  I've never been with a girl before, though.  You ever eat a burrito? 
[01:06:30]  What?  All right.  I'm going to hang up on you, Samantha.  Why?  And this is what I'm going to tell all the ladies.  This is a major treat standing in our studio today.  Listen, I'm hanging up.  No, I want to eat her stuff.  And I never did that before.  I'm hungry.  Then get in your car, because this is what I'm going to say to the ladies, okay?  Yeah.  Okay.  First lady that wants a lesbian experience with this piece of A.  Yeah.  Come on down.  Come on down.  First girl here gets you, right? 
[01:07:00]  Right.  As long as she's not, like, too piggy, right?  Yeah.  She's got to be cute.  Got to be cute.  Yeah.  There's a girl from Texas calling?  So if you're, like, a four or less, don't bother.  Exactly.  Who the hell's a girl from Texas calling?  Let's go to Nicole.  Nicole, what's going on?  I'm actually in New York.  I'm going back to Texas.  And if I knew how to get there, I would be there.  Wow.  Where are you in New York?  I was visiting.  No, no.  Where are you right now?  Oh, I'm on, I don't know.  I'm going to the Verrazano Bridge from Long Island.  From Long Island. 
[01:07:30]  From Brooklyn.  What are you?  What are you, heading towards Staten Island?  No, I'm going 95 South.  I'm going down to Florida and heading over to get to Houston.  She's on her way to Texas.  Right, but if I knew how to get there, I would be there.  And I'm an 8.  Great.  At the very least, I'm an 8.  I'm a redhead.  You're a redhead.  Well, if I, let's see, since we're just speculating, if I was in the seat next to you in the car,  I'd hit you in the head with a spade shovel.  Why?  Because what's the use of calling and saying you would be here?  Yeah, we need to.  Because that is why I want to get there. 
[01:08:00]  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not saying I would be there like I wish I were.  All right, but that's not going to help us.  We've got this piece of A in the studio, and she wants to have a lesbian experience on a  lesbian couch, and we need a girl to show up immediately.  Let's get it going.  Right.  All right?  Look, I may be getting direct.  Four, if anyone's counting.  I will do 20 today.  Great.  Will you mess with Jim Norton if no girls show up?  You don't have to do much. 
[01:08:30]  Don't worry.  I know he looks scary and stuff, but he's an audible.  Has he got nipples?  Mm-hmm.  Can I see him?  Oh, go ahead.  I've seen your junk, so who cares?  That doesn't sound good.  Ooh.  I love that.  I've seen your junk.  I don't get a girl.  Huh?  I don't get a girl.  Yeah?  Can he reciprocate?  I'm working.  I'm working it with Jim Norton.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I don't think I've made the radio. 
[01:09:00]  Why?  That's too bad.  For some reason, they have a problem with the M-word.  Are you into...  That doesn't make sense.  Are you into water sports?  You ever hear of that?  You know what I mean.  Like into...  Let's say you drank a lot of water, right?  Okay.  And then you wait like a half hour, and you've got to do something real bad, but we won't  mention what it is.  Would you do that special something on Norton's head?  Yeah.  There's a water crisis.  Right. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  She's petrified.  I'm kidding.  It's good fertilizer.  It'll make his hair grow.  Yeah.  I'm like a chiopet.  You've got to lay down on the ground.  Huh?  You've got to lay down on the ground.  I don't know how to support yet.  Yeah.  How else are we doing?  I wouldn't expect to run by you and have you shoot it at me.  Hey, you wanted stuffed animals.  All right.  Ladies, give us a call.  Like a sprinkler.  Celeste's in the studio looking all hot and ass, and she wants to get with somebody, so... 
[01:10:00]  Ladies, it's up to you.  First girl down here, if you're above like a five and a half, six?  Six and good.  Six and above?  Yeah.  She's got to be thin.  Thin?  Yeah.  No big gals.  I can't...  I can't even fake it with fat.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Join the club.  That's good to hear that women don't even like fat.  Join the club.  Hey, would you...  Well, you probably don't need the money, right?  What?  Well, look at her.  What?  Do you have a big girl? 
[01:10:30]  No.  She doesn't look like the type.  I think I'm good at picking the type when they do come in here for the certain challenge.  We have this new bit, and we want to try it very soon.  The Motley Crue Challenge.  Uh-oh.  Did you hear about the Motley Crue Challenge?  I think I heard briefly...  Is that great?  Is it where you put the money and they...  It's the double-ended sex toy.  Sex toy.  Oh, I use those every day.  Do you?  Do you?  With another gal, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's a $100 bill in the middle, and whoever gets there first wins the $100 bill. 
[01:11:00]  The Motley Crue Challenge.  I like it.  Yeah, we can't...  Yeah, it'll always be named the Motley Crue Challenge.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  We promise the guys.  Because the guys used to do that.  Yeah, backstage and in their houses.  They can't do it anymore, and they had so much fun with us, they kind of...  They just gave us that.  Gave it to us.  What a gift.  What a gift for Motley Crue, the Motley Crue Challenge.  I can't wait until we are standing here and seeing it done.  Oh, Rick, you weren't here yesterday. 
[01:11:30]  Isn't that the best or what?  Rick, is that great?  The Motley Crue Challenge.  Rocks.  You want to do it, Rick?  Wow.  No way.  Well, we've got to find the perfect sex toy, so there's a bit of a challenge there.  Yeah, it can't just be a single one and, you know, hey, we'll just use the end with the  dial.  No, it's got to be the perfect size, so there's a little effort by both competitors.  Where do you get the retarded Laverne and Shirley and let them do it with a curtain rod?  All right. 
[01:12:00]  Well, Celeste is just sitting here waiting.  She's ready to go, lady, so give us a call if you want to be a lesbian.  Yeah.  Okay.  Earl, what's going on?  Hey, guys, we're here at Mama Cycle.  Sounds like a lyncher.  She's cheering.  Earl's on the back of a horse.  As you can hear, we're having a great time here, handing our last tickets.  Last thing you hear. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah!  Wow, looks like you've got a lot of buyers out there.  I can't make mine!  Oh, my God.  All right, Earl.  Looks like you're having fun with everybody today.  Yeah, we're handing our last tickets.  We've got to take Papa John's Pizza.  They just applied some pizza.  And we're going to be here for another, like, half-hour, 45 minutes of that last ticket.  All right, cool, Earl.  Have fun, all right?  Hey, thanks, guys.  All right, there he goes, Earl.  Really, all that crowd and Earl, the only thing that was missing? 
[01:13:00]  25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 30, 30.  The man over here, $30, $30, $35, $35, we're talking about a nice, strong, black boy.  $35, $35, $40, $40.  Earl's doing that sticker stop at Monument Cycle, 4, Earl.  56 Highway 35 in Middletown, New Jersey.  Yeah.  Hey, we have a girl outside the studio that wants to be a lesbian for a day.  What?  Yeah.  Already?  Yeah.  We need to take a break, but why don't we let Celeste meet her, okay? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah.  Don't look, don't look.  She's walking down the hall.  Look at that.  Yeah, it's a blind thing.  Look at it.  Huh?  Take a sniff.  Take a sniff.  All right.  All right, let's see.  Wait, close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  All right.  You suck, man.  All right, is she a six?  I'm closing my eyes.  Is she a six?  All right, the girl. 
[01:14:00]  The IQ?  Okay.  I just want your reaction.  Don't open your eyes yet, Celeste.  Okay.  This is the girl that wants to be with you on the lesbian couch, Celeste.  No.  Turn to your right and open your eyes.  That is not true.  That's not true.  Boy, that's Facebook's volumes.  Please don't take me serious.  She said, don't take me serious.  I got so excited.  I'm serious.  She said, six on a scale from one to 1,400.  What do you think, Celeste? 
[01:14:30]  No?  No?  We got to do a little better than that for you?  What's your name?  Oh, I'm Patty.  Hi, Patty.  I'm Patty.  I'm Patty.  I don't want to go on the lesbian couch.  Patty, look at those boobs.  That's how they're supposed to look.  Patty, can you show Patty?  That's cruel.  Show Patty.  Look at these, Patty.  What would you do with those?  I don't know what I'd even do with those.  Patty, what do you think of those?  Well, I guess they're right for the individual. 
[01:15:00]  A female.  I don't know.  You know what, though, Patty?  Patty, it would be a waste on you because she's a virgin, and she's, how old are you now?  Forty?  Forty-five?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a 45-year-old virgin.  She's a virgin.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  But to have the equipment and not use it, you know.  It's like the Ferrari that's in the garage all the time.  Patty, would you like to do the Motley Crue Challenge with Celeste?  Oh, my God.  Patty, it would help if you didn't wear your pants like William Frawley. 
[01:15:30]  There's no reason for them to be buttoned up that high.  Hey, Rick, going out of the club.  Exceedings, aren't they?  You've got it, Fania, here I come.  I think I should break her in.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, now we have girls calling saying they can't make it today, but they want to do Celeste tomorrow.  No.  Today, today, today.  Celeste is a very busy girl. 
[01:16:00]  Tomorrow's very up in the air.  All right, we better take a break, Anthony.  Celeste is in the studio.  Storker Patty's in the studio.  Jim Norton's in the studio.  Yes.  And, ladies, please give us a call if you want to be a lesbian for a day with Celeste.  It has to go down today.  It has to go down in the next couple hours.  So someone out there has to help us out.  This is a huge treat for you, I'm telling you.  Right?  Yeah.  Calling it, first of all, offering to do the Motley Crue Challenge with Patty is,  I don't think it's a just to say that.  You know, it's not a good thing for Motley Crue.

The Radio Chick, weekdays 9 to noon, 1027 WNEW.  Anthony, we're in the middle of commercials here, but I've got to talk to Jake real fast.  Jake, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  Hello?  Jake, you're on the radio.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  Let's go.  How you doing, Opie?  Good.  Anthony, everybody, let's go.  My girl wants to come down there.  Okay.  And?  And, you know, bang the hell out of that girl.  Well, what are you waiting for?  What am I waiting for?  I have to ask her a couple of questions.  I want to know if she likes vegetables.  Opie, Sam Adams.  Memorial Day weekend is the unofficial start of summer.  Jake, get your summer off to a better start with a better beer.  Sam Adams.  Can I just tell Jake and everyone else out there, you just come down here.  First girl down here, get Celeste, okay? 
[01:21:00]  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Exactly.  Go ahead.  Sam Adams, summer ale.  Yes, sir.  Sam Adams is the most awarded beer on the planet and in history.  Trade up this summer.  Better food, better parties, better beer.  Look forward to a better summer with Sam Adams.  We love it.  I want to make sure right now.  I had more problems yesterday, but thank God they were icy cold summer ales in the fridge.  But the regular Sam, I pop the top, and this is no lie.  I get a Sam lager out of the fridge, and I'm feeling, I'm like, these don't feel all that cold. 
[01:21:30]  I use my inappropriate bell as a bottle opener.  I pop it.  The thing goes off like a champagne cork and hits Big Kev in the eye, and he's sitting on  the other side of the office.  It exploded.  It went like, boom.  It's like, what?  And then I got to ask, why isn't there cold Sam lager in the fridge?  I don't know.  Like I said, a backup.  There was summer ale in there.  I hate to tell you, but I have a better Sam Adams success story. 
[01:22:00]  Do you, Opie?  Yeah, Vince and Nicky from Motley Crue were in the studio yesterday.  Yeah.  You know, the problems they've had with the substances over the years.  Yeah.  We got them to drink Sam Adams yesterday.  They loved the Sam, the ice cold Sam.  Nicky actually said it took the edge off of the cocaine that he was doing before he came  in.  It really, like, mellowed him out.  Right.  I'm teasing.  Don't send emails to his wife.  We love it.  Sam Adams, if you're in the store, pick up a six for home. 
[01:22:30]  If you're out at a bar, go grab one now.  Sam Adams.  Boom.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Wow.  Boom.  Let him hang.  Wow.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Let him hang.  I see an animal.  They are.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Easty Green Boys Day.  No, it's Sum 41, Anthony.  Fat list.  On the O&A show. 
[01:23:00]  212-757-1027.  We have a full house once again today.  Yeah.  Jim Norton is sitting in with us.  Killing us with the one-liners.  Yeah.  He is a pisser.  Scott Columbo's in here trying to get the stinky cam working.  He already wiped out all the pages I had up on my computer.  So, he's trying to get that working, though, which will be great.  Yeah, because we got the lovely Celeste patiently waiting to be a lesbian for a day with one of our listeners. 
[01:23:30]  Stinky, grab a mic.  A couple ladies called, said they're on their way.  Yeah, three or four.  I told them.  Three or four.  That would be possible.  Celeste, you might have a few girls to choose from.  Well, good.  I brought some toys for them.  What do you got?  Oh, handcuffs and blindfolds and stuff.  Velcro handcuffs.  Yeah, those Velcro handcuffs look like they're tough to get out of.  Velcro cuffs.  Ooh.  Ooh, lock up those criminals.  The Velcro cuffs.  Those are tough. 
[01:24:00]  What am I going to do?  I'm all locked up with Velcro.  I don't know how the Velcro works.  Oh, no.  Don't put me in a Velcro jail, lady.  I'll die.  Know what impression you're doing right there?  Not Brian Regan.  No.  Who?  Frank Caliendo doing Brian Regan.  Huh.  Oh, no.  Norton, no lesbians yet for Celeste.  What's that going on?  The only guy rooting for no one showing up is Norton.  Right.  Because he'll jump in there. 
[01:24:30]  We also got to welcome Jamie to the little radio show.  Buffalino, right?  That's right.  Jamie Buffalino from Time Out New York.  Anthony, we read his letters when the new issues of Time Out New York come out.  Pretty damn good.  Real advice column, right?  Absolutely.  And what is the majority of the letters you get?  Or sex, right?  All of them are.  Yeah, they're all sex.  And relationships.  And relationships, yeah.  And some of them are just out there.  The bestiality one really caught our eye.  I think that was last week?  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  I mean, there's a lot of sickos in New York.  There's no doubt about it.  Can you tell us about the bestiality letter again?  Yeah.  As I recall, it was two gay guys who had previously been into bestiality before they met.  And one of them wrote in and asked, you know, is it okay to participate in bestiality now that I'm in a relationship?  Or is it cheating?  Is it cheating?  You know, it's just a question.  Not the way I phrased it at all.  Read it verbatim.  Yeah, that's an interesting question. 
[01:25:30]  You know, because you're with somebody.  You're in a relationship.  If it's an animal that you're fooling around with, is it cheating?  Well, I don't think cheating is really the issue.  Yeah, I think it goes a little deeper than the cheating thing.  Just a smidgen.  I think that you're having sex with an animal might take pressure.  Now, Jamie, I've been reading your column for a long time.  Is that the sickest letter you've ever gotten?  It's the sickest one I ever read.  Well, you know, I mean, I don't know if I'd classify it as the sickest.  I get a lot of bodily function. 
[01:26:00]  I'll talk to him right there.  More letters from Norton.  You ought to check the postmark on those.  I'm sure they're all the same.  Well, I have potty issues, so it's like when I get those letters, those really freak me out.  Oh, really?  You don't like the whole thing?  I just can't imagine.  Experiment thing.  I mean, it's sex.  Why do you have to, like, screw it up with stuff like that?  With crap.  Right.  I got you.  I agree.  Log's bad.  Log equals bad.  But he likes a little tinkle.  Who doesn't?  Really?  Norton likes that.  Norton really likes that.  You mean while he's alone or with someone?  No, no.  He likes the girl. 
[01:26:30]  While he's babysitting.  Oh, Jesus.  Norton had his roommate's girlfriend.  Yes.  Do the little goldie.  And another girl.  Do a goldie to him.  A goldie, yes.  And another girl.  Really?  Yeah.  They called up Norton.  They were out all night.  You should tell that story again, because of course they were going to do it.  I would never fool around with this girlfriend.  I am.  They were going to do it.  She wanted to try it.  And, you know, I'm a team player, so.  Yeah, you're there, available for her to try this out on.  Sure.  And she had a girlfriend with her.  And Jim calls me, because they were drinking all night. 
[01:27:00]  Jim Florentine.  Yeah, Florentine is like, Jim, get ready.  We're on our way.  So I have to lay on the floor and prep.  Yeah, how do you get ready for that?  You throw down towels and you start whacking your bag so the timing is good.  It was a genuine project I was involved in.  So you're there waiting.  Yeah, but it was for like ten minutes, but I couldn't get too close because I'd finished  before they got there.  Right.  It was interest.  And I couldn't not start.  Right.  So I had to time it right.  Because you're all worked up about it. 
[01:27:30]  Really?  Exactly, yeah.  And in the middle of the experience, it was great.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, a lot of fluid.  And it was his girlfriend?  Yeah, but I didn't touch her.  Would you just gaze up and you're looking, looking, and then when do you shut your eyes?  You don't.  It's like a pool with too much clothes.  Yeah, that's funny.  You feed me to it.  I have little goggles.  I think they have a little swim goggle.  There's one with the swim goggles on.  Doesn't Visine put out a golden shower, Visine, just for those occasions? 
[01:28:00]  I didn't eat a half hour before.  Dry eyes, red eyes, golden shower eyes, try clear eyes for Goldie.  Little swimmies on.  Did you have swimmies on so you wouldn't stink?  Little baby swimmies.  In the kiddie pool.  Celeste, are you horrified yet?  Not yet.  No?  Isn't that a twisted story, though?  But he's a great guy.  Yeah, we love him.  I've seen one.  Really?  So, Jamie, you get letters like that?  Yeah, I get letters like that.  I did an interview once with one guy who actually liked to wear diapers. 
[01:28:30]  Nice.  Infantilism.  Yeah, you might be.  What?  Infantilism.  That's called adult babies.  No, it's not my thing.  I want to be powdered.  That's awful.  We had an adult baby in here.  Yeah, it's really sick to watch.  It's disturbing and kind of you feel creeped out.  It was a big, fat guy.  We see a lot in the studio, but that day it was just weird because when the mics are off,  you try to make small talk, and the guy is dressed as a baby.  What do you say?  He's dressed as a baby, and they went through the little routine, this dominatrix and this 
[01:29:00]  baby.  And she's feeding him his bottle, and she's got his little toys that he plays with, and  baby talks with her, and then she changed the diaper.  I mean, it was, and you're watching this big, fat guy going, and then he's trying to say,  you know, I hold down the job.  I'm a normal guy.  I just have this side of me that I enjoy.  No, you're not a normal guy.  Yeah, because he would turn it off when he had to.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm at work.  And then he'd go back to acting like a baby. 
[01:29:30]  All the noises and everything.  I work on Wall Street, and I'm a normal guy.  Some days at the market, you should wear a diaper.  I was crapping myself on E-Trade.  What was the letter about with the guy with the diapers?  Well, I mean, he was just talking about his whole lifestyle.  It was an interview, so he was saying how, like, he likes to go home from work, put on  a diaper, and just, you know.  Yeah.  And relieve himself?  Have a Goldie.  Yeah.  Kick back.  Oh, my God.  It was like, he compared it to having a cocktail.  So, I mean, I think some people have just different associations. 
[01:30:00]  What was he asking you in the letter?  Ways he should kill himself?  Great.  We have a fan of yours on the line, and he's a friend of the show.  Gay Marco.  Check it in.  Oh, Gay Marco.  Marco.  Hey.  What's up, Marco?  Happy birthday, Opie.  Thank you.  Marco?  Yes?  If you could give Opie anything for his birthday, what would it be?  My wad.  Are you?  Damn you, man.  So, you're digging Jamie? 
[01:30:30]  I love Jamie.  I read Time Out New York every week.  I love, love, love his column.  I love it.  Thank you very much.  It's so great.  And, Jamie, you're so cute, too.  Oh, there you go.  He's got a cute little picture up there.  But I have a question for Jamie.  Okay.  Okay?  Now, Jamie, I have sex a lot, like five, six times a week.  Right.  And my friends think I'm a slut.  Okay.  And your question is?  Am I a slut?  Well, is it with the same person or is it with five different people every week? 
[01:31:00]  It's with, like, five different people every week.  I haven't met someone yet who I'm ready to settle down with.  Right.  So, I'm experimenting.  Well, you know, I don't like to throw around the word slut just casually.  But, you know, I mean, is it working for you or does Jill?  I love it.  Oh, my God.  Marco, do you practice safe sex?  Of course I do.  Don't.  Oh, come on.  Oh, my God.  So, that's all you have today, Marco? 
[01:31:30]  That's it.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Thank you.  Talk to you later.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  There's a frigging college mixer going on in his colon.  He's probably put a garbage bag in it.  He's lying in it like a bull.  Spray some gunite in there.  We kid because we love, right?  We love, Marco.  Of course we do.  And, by the way, I've got to say that line about him eating space food yesterday.  It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard anybody say.  He's found the used condom in the guy's, his roommate's bed. 
[01:32:00]  He had a roommate, a straight cop.  Marco, obviously.  Don't want to shake you up, people, but he is a gay man.  Right.  And he said he found a used condom.  And all I could think of was watching the old NASA footage of the astronauts eating that  space food.  Enough said.  That's a sick lie.  Very disturbing to show you.  Yes.  We've got to check in with Earl again.  Earl, what's up?  Earl.  Hey, guys.  We're at Mama's Cycle down in Middletown, New Jersey, 656 Highway 35. 
[01:32:30]  The crowd here is unbelievable.  And we're handing out wild stickers.  Coffee and chicken gave us some free chicken.  So, I know, the black guy's handing out the chicken.  Oh, my God.  Can you steer clear of a couple of stereotypes, Earl?  I know.  They were really cool.  They gave us some chicken.  And we've got pizza so far.  We have chicken.  We're just having a flat-out party here.  It's really great.  Earl, how's the watermelon bowling for prizes going today? 
[01:33:00]  It's going great.  It's my great soda.  Earl's handing out the chicken.  He's eating a flat-out person.  That's what we found.  We're going to be here for two more minutes.  Wait, you hear that guy.  It's completely black people still coming in.  I got their lap tickets.  You hear that guy in the background.  He goes, Earl's even black-out person.  Earl, they love you.  Earl, it's good to be in love, guys.  I mean, we have got to do a road show down here.  Just the crowd down here has been great.  All right.  We'll try to make that happen when we figure everything out, okay? 
[01:33:30]  All right.  We'll be here for a few more minutes, guys.  Just a few minutes.  You've got to give people time to get there.  I mean, believe me, Highway 35 is pretty packed up right now.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Thanks for doing that.  Thanks, guys.  Take that out of your boy.  Thanks for the effort, man.  I took you later, guys.  All right.  Starring in the sequel to Mississippi Burning today.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What are you guys doing?  Yo, O&A. 
[01:34:00]  You guys rule.  Thanks.  We're hanging out with Jamie from Time Out New York.  And the lovely Celeste.  We're still waiting for a woman to show up to be a lesbian for a day with this piece of ass.  Could somebody focus the stinky cam?  I mean, everyone's screaming.  We finally get it online, and people aren't like, wow, okay, you finally got it online.  They're like, focus, you a-hole.  Am I still on?  Yeah, Jamie, smile.  You're on theater.  Oh, oh, no.  I can see him.  Mike, go ahead.  All right, yeah.  I was a 21-year-old comedian.  I called yesterday, and I told Motley Crue that I was on Quaaludes. 
[01:34:30]  Do you remember that?  Yeah, how could we forget?  It was one of the worst calls we got yesterday.  I know, I know.  I got the whole show to a grinding halt.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo, what's it called?  You guys have to come down to Huntington.  You guys have to come down to Christopher.  Again.  Again.  I think he was going to say come down to Christopher's in Huntington.  Oh, really?  Christopher's burned down.  They're rebuilding, yeah.  That's five, by the way.  What a tool.  God damn.  People are keeping track at home. 
[01:35:00]  Angela, what's up?  Hello.  Angela.  Hi.  How you been?  Okay, how are you?  You're staying out of Bellevue?  Yes.  Good.  Yes.  I just want to say hi.  Yeah, this is Angela from the HBO Bellevue special.  Bellevue special.  Who is proof?  I just want to say hi to you guys.  Jamie, did you see that?  I was trying to get through yesterday.  I did not see that now.  Okay.  Huh?  Excuse me?  What did you say, Angela?  I said I was trying to get through yesterday like three times.  Yeah.  They put on me on hold.  We had a pretty busy show yesterday.  I guess because of, you know.  What was it? 
[01:35:30]  Vince Neil and Nicky Six?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  I was trying to get through.  I was like, I want to say hi to them.  They were so cool yesterday.  Yeah, I was a big fan of them in the 80s.  I think we found some new friends yesterday.  Who wasn't?  Yeah.  Those guys, anytime you're walking to the strip club, they're dancing.  And you weren't there last night.  You weren't?  I went to the place I was last week.  What?  What?  I went to the place that I saw you last week.  Oh, uh.  And you weren't there this week.  And your brother's there?  Oh, by nine.  By nine on Tuesday.  I saw you last night, too. 
[01:36:00]  You know me?  I was there with Stephen Lynch, Mikey Nicola.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And some awful band.  Yeah.  Did you see them?  No, I didn't.  Brother Joe had to take the week off.  Yeah.  He'll be there next Tuesday.  Next week, that's keeping up to be quite the party down there at Bar Nine on Tuesday.  I'll be there, definitely.  It's insane.  I know.  We've been having a good time there.  And Angela got up on stage a couple of Tuesdays ago and sang a couple of tunes.  That was a lot of fun.  That really was.  That really was.  That was pretty cool.  Yeah, show up there next week.  We'll all go up and have a pisser. 
[01:36:30]  I just want to tell you, I'm a big fan of your show now.  I never even really listened to you before.  Ah, see?  And now I'm really digging you guys.  You're really cool.  That's because you were a kook when you didn't listen.  See?  We help people out.  We help you get sane here.  You go from Bellevue to being totally normal with ONA.  That is so funny.  It's nice now to enjoy the voice coming out of the box.  Set it in your head.  All right, Angela.  Okay.  Take it easy.  She wasn't a fan because I don't think they allowed radios in Bellevue.  No, of course not.  Not ONA. 
[01:37:00]  Tried to eat it.  Officially, that was six.  Officially.  She had a couple other words to say there.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I got a question for Norton over there.  Yes, sir.  I don't understand how you give out about a guy wearing diapers and you're getting, like,  urinated on.  All right.  I'll explain it to you.  I'm a pervert, but I always speak like an adult for the experience.  All right?  Not that.  I don't think that's sexy.  I want to get a little bit on me and then dump and get out of there.  Should we wear a diaper on your head? 
[01:37:30]  I don't wear a little...  No, I don't wear a diaper on my head.  I'm not a cam driver, you schmuck.  I like adult sex.  I'm a pervert, but I'm not a three-year-old.  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  It's indication of my head.  Thank you.  We're in an adult relationship.  It's a mature relationship.  Donna Hanover never peed on me, and I really needed that in my relationship.  And now that my chick can't come in Gracie Mansion, I'm pissed. 
[01:38:00]  You just don't picture him getting into the kink of it, though.  You know, Giuliani?  Could you picture that?  Hello.  I like dressing in women's clothing and being urinated on.  How do I get my girlfriend to do this?  P.S.  I'm really in the public eye and scrutinized, so I can't really go around smelling like urine.  Is this a letter for Jamie's column?  Yes.  I think I might have gotten one from him.  From Giuliani?  No, I'm kidding.  My prostate is like a pineapple, and it hurts me.  I have not gotten excited in over a year. 
[01:38:30]  Besides closing down strip clubs, what can I do to make myself feel better about sex?  Then he tells the press to leave him alone.  This is a private issue.  Is that insane?  It's just going to make the press circle even more.  It's not a private.  He tried to get a gag order on Hanover, Donna Hanover, and they're like, no.  Then he goes, okay, but I think we should keep this shibble.  Meanwhile, his lawyer is just bashing the hell out of her.  She's whining.  Tell her to shut up and get on with her life. 
[01:39:00]  He's in hell right now.  I mean, this whole thing of his, yeah, he's going to the Brooklyn Museum and trying to preach and say, you know, this isn't wholesome entertainment or good.  He's married.  He's banging his jack.  He's such a hypocrite.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm sure you're not a big fan of that, Julianne, right?  I'm not a big fan, no.  Yeah.  None of us are.  I like him.  Do you?  Yeah, just the guy like him, the way he's just the homeless people.  He just gets them out of the street.  They're just simians.  Ow! 
[01:39:30]  Simians!  Simians!  Savage.  Good for him.  I got to tell you, I like him.  When was the last time?  I like him.  When was the last time you saw a squeegee guy?  Exactly.  It's very hard to see the squeegee guys anymore.  Yeah, but that was entertaining when you were stuck in traffic.  The tunnel bunnies, you know?  You don't see the tunnel bunnies anymore.  It's very hard to find hookers.  Now they're in the car.  No, it's not.  No, no, no.  Well, you got to know where to look, I guess.  I did it last night.  Forty bucks.  Nice.  But you don't...  Nice.  What did you get?  Happy ending?  He's not kidding.  No, I'm dead serious. 
[01:40:00]  Fine treats for forty dollars.  Forty bucks.  What do you get for the forty?  Yeah, what do you get for the forty?  A Hummer and a lovely one, I might add.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's a girl I know.  She's terrific.  Does she roll the condom on discreetly or no condom?  Oh, no, no, no.  Everything's safe, believe me.  Yeah?  Does she do the roll-on with the, you know, she puts the condom in her mouth and...  Yeah, she has like a Russian accent.  Oh, baby.  Which I just like, that's a bad accent, but I like it.  That's kind of like Dice doing a girl.  Oh, baby.  Baby doll. 
[01:40:30]  You're one of her regulars?  Yeah.  Just the fact that I think she's doing it for hot soup.  That really messed me up.  Did you get a urine cancer last night?  No, I don't do that with girls like that, man.  Only a girl I know.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, come on.  What's wrong with you?  Now you're being weird.  Yeah, that would be odd.  Jamie's being weird.  Joe, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jamie, I was wondering if there's a difference...  It was a cup, not a wine glass.  Same thing.  It's not the same thing.  Wine glass implies elegance. 
[01:41:00]  I was in my car.  Yeah.  With her head under the steering wheel, right?  That was a girl I used to date, a British girl.  Jamie, what do you think of Norton?  All right.  What kind of problems do you think I'm prepared to even take him on?  No.  He's very honest and open about his sexuality, which I think is refreshing, healthy, and utterly disgusting.  Yeah, if they weren't completely abnormal, it'd be great.  Yeah.  But I like regular stuff, too, man.  I mean, I like regular, you know what I mean, straightforward type of rape and sodomy situations. 
[01:41:30]  Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Have any girls shown up yet?  Not yet.  Or called that want to be a lesbian for a day?  Jesus Christ.  I think they need to see more pictures of me.  I agree.  Yeah, well, the Stinky Cam right now is up and running.  Are you showing enough cleavage for the Stinky Cam?  Oh, yeah.  Shot I got on now?  Yeah.  Well, they can see some completely nude pictures of me at PleasureVIP.com. 
[01:42:00]  PleasureVIP.com.  Completely nude.  Completely nude.  That's funny.  I am on PleasureVIP.com.  No.  You've got to unzip a little for the Stinky Cam.  Give them a little more tease, and then they're going to want to see more and go to PleasureVIP.com.  Pleasure VIP.  Oh, that's more than a zip.  Where you always feel like a VIP.  Zip, zip.  Zipper scenes.  Oh, does that stop?  Look at the way.  I know.  When the picture scrolls down and it stops right before the boob shot, I hate that.  It's like the old 1996 downloading for hours off an AOL porno picture. 
[01:42:30]  That was the worst.  Oh, there's the nose.  There are the eyes.  What am I playing?  Concentration?  I want to see a nude picture.  Love of God.  Kristen, what's up?  Nothing much.  I wanted to say hi to Norton.  Because I've only talked to you once, not even on, like, instant messenger.  Oh, you're Ben's little girlfriend.  Well, who do you think it is?  I thought you would never call us after the treatment you got.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, my...  17-year-old, in love with Ben, written poetry about him, wants to do sexual things and has 
[01:43:00]  sexual favors to Ben.  But Ben, completely uninterested in this girl.  Don't pretend you want to say hi to me.  You just want to use me to get to Ben.  That's what I am to you.  Just a disgusting, single-drinking link to Ben.  Oh.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  And you might want to remember her father in the hospital.  Oh, yeah.  All right, all right.  No, that's very sad.  I'm having battling cancer.  Right.  Oh, of course.  But you can probably make Kristen cry over it, of course. 
[01:43:30]  No.  The listeners took that one upon themselves.  We didn't even know we were playing until the end.  Sure.  Horrible.  So, Kristen, what do you have today?  Because we don't want to waste 20 minutes with you today.  Well, I just wanted to say hi to Norton and, you know, say hi.  How many?  Seven.  Ed, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good.  We're hanging out with Jamie.  I've got a question for Jamie.  I'm out of New York.  Yeah.  What's with this editor trying to out the ballplayer? 
[01:44:00]  And since you guys are probably tight, who is it?  You've got to know.  Come on.  Is that for me?  Yeah.  Do you know who the ball?  I have no idea, but I'm just going to read a little background on the story.  I guess the editor of Out Magazine wrote an editorial about his boyfriend who happens  to be a major league baseball player.  On the East Coast?  On the East Coast.  Not the star player, but a very well high-profile baseball player.  Very high-profile player.  East Coast baseball team.  Right.  We're just trying to figure out if he's a pitcher or a catcher.  Ah. 
[01:44:30]  Oh.  Oh.  You get one toot on the wacky horn.  For that one, I'll do.  Thank you.  I'll guess Brady Anderson, because gay guys love Brady.  It's true.  They love Brady Anderson.  I'm not saying he's gay, but because he's very well-built, because if you've ever seen  his ads, I mean, who doesn't?  I heard he plays for the Baltimore Orioles, and he had a 50-home run year a few years ago,  and he has actually, I heard gay guys go ballistic for him.  Really?  I heard Marco would back.  Yeah.  I heard they have a page.  I've never seen it.  Don't say I'm sure Marco will back you up, because I'm sure he would.  No, not back me up.  Back up the theory.  No, Marco wouldn't bang me. 
[01:45:00]  He's like an eight and a half.  I'm like a three to gay guys.  I've got a meaty little belly.  I don't work out.  Believe me, no.  Gay guys want nothing to do with me.  A meaty little belly?  Yeah.  Disgusting, awful man.  You're scaring Celeste.  I can't do that with Celeste.  Get a girl.  I want to see a girl with her.  She's going to be the grand finale of this show.  Yeah.  It's got to be with a girl, though.  Get a girl done.  So far, the lady's letting us down.  She'll be here.  I cannot believe this.  It's rush hour.  It's rush hour.  Maybe I should talk to the girls.  Don't you want to juggle those?  Come on, ladies. 
[01:45:30]  Take a look at them.  I'm looking at the stinky camera right now, and it's astounding.  She's a very lovely girl.  Very beautiful.  See, this is the difference between guys and girls.  We've stoked about a million times.  If we put her picture up there like it is right now, you see her boobs in all their glory,  and say, guys, come down here, and we wouldn't even get the words out before we were stampeded with guys that would want to get on the couch with her.  But it's girls.  I don't know if I should.  Maybe we should talk first to see a movie or something.  Get your dyke asses down here and start chewing some rug. 
[01:46:00]  Crumpet munchies.  Crumpet munchies.  Crumpet munchies.  You know, girls, I do girl-girl movies for pleasure production.  Girl-girl movies.  I can't believe we have to sit here and tell everyone how hot this rug is.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Look on your computers.  If you don't get down here, I'm going to wind up having to kill her.  So please come down here.  Stinky.  It's very beautiful.  How many girls on the way, and how serious do they sound?  Two were so-so, but then one, this girl Coco, she called back to even ask if she could bring her dildo. 
[01:46:30]  Wow, that's great.  You ready to bring your dildo?  She's like Paul Bunyan with the axe.  She's going to show up.  I like it.  Hey, Stinky.  Get on, Mike.  This is Jamie from Time Out New York.  He writes the sex advice column in the back.  You've got to hear his story.  Oh, really?  You think his story's effed up.  He lives with a pedophile.  No.  Yeah.  He's aware to God.  Yeah.  He just sits on the computer all day chatting it up with little boys and going to pedophile pages and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  Danish pedophile websites.  Do you live in the city?  Yep.  Really?  Yeah.  He doesn't make a lot of money, and he was going through the Village Voice, and he found  this place, and he wishes he didn't find his place.  One bedroom, very small.  There's little loft beds on either side of the bedroom, so he is a mere five feet away  from the other guy's bed, separated with a curtain, like a sleeper cabin on a train or something.  He just pulls the curtain, and this guy goes to sleep when he gets home from his job as 
[01:47:30]  a teacher, by the way.  And he sleeps for a little while, and then Stinky says he gets up at one in the morning,  goes into the kitchen, the common kitchen that Stinky has to eat his food in, sits at the  computer.  He's 63 years old.  He sits there and proceeds to crank it in the kitchen to kiddie porn.  Which makes it sound so nice, isn't it?  It sounds like a great place.  Looking at Danish pornography, which...  Wait, in all fairness, though, you haven't seen actual kiddie porn pictures on the... 
[01:48:00]  No, only the one time when his password didn't work, and I got to go to his recent document  folder, and I saw the movies he looked at.  And what were some of the movies?  Like some little boy, like, standing over a dresser and someone behind him.  Oh, my God.  Oh, dear, yes, yes, Major West.  Woo!  So we're trying to get Stinky out of this place.  Yeah, I think that's a good idea.  I don't like this whole Danish pornography thing.  You know, there's so many children in this country that need to be molested. 
[01:48:30]  I hear the fact that you're going over there to do it.  I'm not going to be happy until every kid in this country wakes up at 3 in the morning  crying with a secret.  So, damn it, molested children in this country...  Oh, Norton, Jimmy's never going to come back now.  Thank you.  He's never coming back, Celeste will never be back.  He'll never be back.  Wow.  So.  Was it uncomfortable when you went home yesterday after we discussed  your roommate for two hours?  I was talking to Stinky.  What was he doing when you got home?  I got home, and there he is in his underwear on the computer with the stove on. 
[01:49:00]  It's about 95 degrees in the kitchen.  He turns the stove on to stay warm because he's in his underwear when he's on the computer.  I don't know.  Did Anthony Hopkins play this guy last summer?  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Just picture this rundown kitchen with the old stove.  The only light is like the blue gas flame from the stove.  This old pedophile sitting at the computer in his underwear.  And you've got to come home to that.  Stinky has a very baby face, too, so...  Oh, we were talking about that.  Yeah.  This guy's 63 years old.  Stinky's 22? 
[01:49:30]  23.  23?  To him, Stinky's like a kid.  Yeah.  And we were talking about him going through the hamper, and...  What'd you say that Stinky's dirty laundry was to this guy?  Uh, potpourri.  It's like potpourri.  And the guy's...  Boom.  I already set up traps, though.  Like, I put a little thing on the hamper to see if it falls, and I put something by my bed to see if it falls.  Ah, good.  You set the traps.  All the remarks.  This is an ongoing story.  Set the traps.  If you weren't listening yesterday, it's going to be on our Best of Show this coming Saturday.  Yeah.  The whole Stinky Roommate thing, because it's great. 
[01:50:00]  Jeez.  But you set the traps.  Yeah.  That's a healthy living situation.  Does it smell in there?  Is there an odor that comes off of this guy?  Sometimes in the kitchen it does.  It smells like man sack.  What is it smell like?  Locker room type of...  Locker room.  Great.  Dirty old man sack.  I mean, he doesn't even talk to the guy.  They're like...  And the place is tiny.  Yeah.  And he just...  He has all the windows closed so we can keep the heat in.  It's just...  You know, the smell...  Man, this is like a...  What made you say yes to renting? 
[01:50:30]  That's what I'm thinking.  Like, ooh, this is great.  This is a scene out of...  I was home in two weeks, though.  This is a scene out of seven.  Yeah.  I think he looks young and he smiles a lot.  Like, almost like a retarded boy.  He's such a happy, smiley boy.  Did you ever see the man's underwear with a pointy?  Does he wear a tighty whitey?  No, he wears, like, loose, like, thermal underwear that he cuts or something.  Stinky, touch this doll where he's touching it.  Does he ever touch where your bathing suit covers? 
[01:51:00]  No.  Oh, God.  A very special stinky.  Well, we got a lead on a place yesterday for you.  Yeah.  Because that's the other thing we're doing with this old match.  We're going to find him a new place.  You just need a roommate now.  Yeah.  And it's so funny in the back office because we really found a place that he would move in tomorrow,  but he has to find a roommate.  Right, and he's kind of bummed, like, oh, God, you never know, you know, who you're going to room with.  That guy that dressed as a clown would be a step up. 
[01:51:30]  I mean, think about it.  Exactly.  Donna Hanover needs a new roommate, right?  There you go.  Hey, roomie.  Oh, it's ready.  And Donna Hanover sits in front of the computer and looks at Dana's porn all night.  I can't get away from this.  All right, so you set traps, so you'll have an update tomorrow or Friday.  Good, good.  You're going to set traps on your bed.  Yeah, I did.  Did you?  I made my bed, and I folded a corner over to see if that corner...  Good, because we found out from Marco, who lived with a straight cop for a while, 
[01:52:00]  it was roomies with him, that Marco used to, when the guy left,  he'd go in his bed, when it wasn't made,  and roll around and smell his manliness on the sheets and pillow  as he pleasured himself in the guy's bed.  And all I do is picture my roommate in my bed, just rolling around.  Oh, this is great.  Young man ash.  Smelling halfway down on the bed, because it smells a little like pennies.  God, that's disgusting, man.  You know what you ought to do, man? 
[01:52:30]  You set him up, you arc one into a bed.  Can we say that?  You arc one into a bag, and you take lighter fluid or gas,  and you put it in there, so if he decides to drink it, he dies.  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  It's J-Lisa, Opie.  J-Lisa.  What happened?  Brian, boy, silly me.  Upper West Side twat.  What can we do for you?  Dude, don't ruin this, because you see how hot the West is. 
[01:53:00]  I apologize.  This girl wants to come in.  Where are you?  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  J-Lisa.  I'm on the LA going through the tunnel in about two seconds, going into Manhattan.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  All right.  Are you a six or better?  Better.  Well, I would think better.  All right.  And I've never had any complaints, so.  Okay.  And you want to have a lesbian experience with Celeste, right?  Yeah.  If you're in the tunnel, why don't you do a commercial for your fantastic cell phone that you're on right now?  No, no, she's perching the tunnel. 
[01:53:30]  No, I'm not in the tunnel yet.  Yeah, she's about to go into the tunnel.  And as soon as I go through the tunnel, I'm going to lose the call.  So actually what I just wanted was directions.  57th?  Where you're located.  Very easy, 57th and 7th.  Okay.  We will even have someone waiting to park your car so you can run right up here.  How long is she going to be there until?  Hopefully, what, another hour?  Until you get here.  Until you get here.  Oh, very much.  Hold on, hold on.  Before you ruin it.  Quick, quick, Rick.  Before she goes into the tunnel. 
[01:54:00]  All right, let's take a break.  Things are starting to shape up nicely here.  Yes.  We have Jim Norton.  We have Jamie from Time Out New York.  He writes the sex column.  If you want to ask Jamie a question, that's cool, right?  Yeah.  And of course, Celeste.  You having fun, Celeste?  I'm having fun.  Anything else you want to do for us?  I'm thinking, I'm thinking, uh, Heine?  Heine.  Can Jim see your Heine?  See, my Heine, that's my best asset.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What are you doing, say?  You're insane. 
[01:54:30]  She's wearing a nice snake skin.  Very beautiful.  Yeah.  Little jumper number.  Backless.  Wait, can you go over to Norton?  Go over to Norton.  Wow.  Hey, look at that.  You got to give the slow, dramatic clap.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Very beautiful.  I have to tell you.  Very beautiful.  Whoever gets in here is a very lucky girl.  Nice.  All right.  God, that's nice.  We'll take a break and we'll continue this mess. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  Were we going to talk about anything worthwhile today?  There were a couple of things, but now some of them slipped my mind.  A little distracted.  Yeah.  Bernie Getz running for mayor.  Can we talk about that later?  Yeah, we saw a little special on Bernie Getz.  Yeah, we can talk about him and his goddamn squirrels.  God bless him.  We did a great bit.  We should play that.  You feel like a squirrel advocate or something.  The Bernie Getz squirrel bit that we did.  Well, it won us an award.  You might as well.  You know something?  We might as well play our award-winning material. 
[01:55:30]  I want to hear it.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Here comes the music.  The power of the wow singer.  How old are you?  18.  How old are you?  What are you showing on?  Wow.  Fabulous.  Wow.  Holy ravioli.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, duh.  1027 WNEW.  The Hagstrom New York City Five Borough Atlas.

Everything.  I don't know if you're mad.  I'm selling maps.  You're getting happy over maps, though.  The Hagstrom map.  You're getting bummed out over maps.  It's the happiest map of maps.  Yeah, yeah.  You just did a cancer read on a map.

[01:58:30]  Guess who's dead?  Whoa, you just, someone died?  Yeah.  Actor Whitman Mayo.  Whoa.  Whitman Mayo.  You know who Whitman Mayo is?  No.  Grady.  Grady from Sanford and Son.  Shut up, Demi.  Thank you, Red Fox.  Grady's dead?  I knew, I knew that before the show.  I forgot to tell you.  Did he die of a congestive career failure?  70 years old, died of a heart attack while being transported to the hospital for a hernia. 
[01:59:00]  What a mess he must have been.  He looked like 70 when he was on Sanford's.  I don't know, Fred.  Great goobly goo.  Remember he used to say that?  Yeah.  I got a little, I got a little story about Grady.  You have a Grady story?  I have a, I met Grady.  I met Grady once.  All right.  I was taking the NBC studio tours when I was out in elementary school.  Oh, I was going to ask you if you did a good job with your shoes.  I was, it was elementary school. 
[01:59:30]  Do we have music?  I'm trying.  That I could tell my little, hold on.  My little brush with Grady.  NBC studio tours when I was out in elementary school in California.  They took us on a field trip.  And me and a couple of guys in my class ran off from the group that they were taking us on the tour.  And we went through the hallways of the dressing rooms of NBC studios out in a beautiful downtown Burbank in California. 
[02:00:00]  And as we're going through the hallways, the door opens up.  Lo and behold, Grady's there.  He was a page?  He was mopping up.  No, it was Grady.  He came out of his dressing room.  And we were stunned.  We stopped there.  It was me and two other guys that left the group.  And we just started going, oh, my God, Grady, how are you doing?  Grady, it's an honor to meet you, Grady.  He goes, what the F are you kids doing back here in the hallway? 
[02:00:30]  You're not supposed to F-ing be back here.  And call security to have us removed from the back hallway of NBC.  So that was my brush with Grady.  Nice.  The late Grady.  Anthony, I think he's getting ready for our next segment.  He has just brought all our porno from our back office into the studio.  Now, you might ask why.  Why would we remove the porno from our office and bring it all back here where we received it here in the studio? 
[02:01:00]  We'll tell people in a few minutes here.  But first, Kimmy wants to say hi from Survivor.  Kimmy.  Hey, guys.  What's up, Kimmy?  Nothing.  Hey, I miss you guys.  Where are you?  I'm at home, believe it or not.  I finally got home.  I was actually out in Arizona for a little while.  What are you doing out there?  You know, being me.  Who are you having sex with out there?  Or what radio host are you sucking up to today?  You guys are so funny.  Kimmy, can I tell you something?  You don't have to suck up to anyone. 
[02:01:30]  Just be yourself.  Yeah.  Just be yourself.  I am so totally myself.  You know that.  Just a little advice from your pals here.  I'm not going to suck up to anybody.  Okay.  I'm just giving you a little advice.  You're too good for that.  You just be you.  Yeah.  Well, that's exactly what I am.  I'm being accused of snubbery, but I don't care.  Snubbery.  Snubbery.  But, yeah, I think I'm going to jump on the bag wagon and tell you happy birthday.  Well, no one really has called or anything.  You're like the first, I think.  I hope he doesn't care. 
[02:02:00]  You are so funny.  No, I do care.  And worked with the Pinnacle.  Pretty good stuff.  You worked with Pinnacle Hornigowie?  Yeah, and the Monkeying Around.  You did the Monkeying Around.  And what happened?  But you're a horned dog before that.  I know, so I really can't really vouch, can I?  But it didn't suck, so it couldn't hurt.  It might help.  Wow.  It didn't suck.  It couldn't hurt.  What?  But she's like horny as it is.  You know what I mean?  So how was Jim Norton?  She never showed up. 
[02:02:30]  She was supposed to be the comedy cellar.  It never came.  Oh, you were going for the hookup.  No, not the hookup, not at all.  No?  I had tape and a hammer.  No, because then he gave me a phone number.  He's like, okay, you can't call my cell phone.  You have to call this other number.  And I ended up getting stuck until 11 o'clock at a thing.  But I got to...  Why couldn't she call your cell phone?  It was out of batteries.  Oh.  Yeah.  I thought maybe you were some, you know, I don't want someone else to know or...  Please.  Right.  He's like, okay, if somebody else picks up the phone, just hang up.  Just hang up. 
[02:03:00]  Say ma.  You know, just start annoying me.  No, never.  No.  Hey, I want to know when you guys are doing a sticker stop out here.  That way I can, like, you know, leave the wagon.  Where are you again?  Long Island.  Oh, you're on the island today.  Yeah, we haven't done a sticker stop on Long Island.  I know.  We'll do one very soon and we'll get you a...  Because everyone asks me.  I'm now like the O&A liaison from Long Island.  You're an ambassador.  Yes.  Yes, I am.  The horny ambassador.  We could use you today.  Celeste is in the studio looking all hot and stuff and she wants a lesbian experience. 
[02:03:30]  But I'm not a lesbian, so I don't have that experience.  So the joke would be on her.  No.  That old gag.  I want to give a lesbian experience.  Give.  Yeah, give.  Yes.  She's giving.  Very giving.  She's been there all day now.  I know.  We're waiting for a girl to show up.  Well, what the hell's the matter with these people?  I don't know.  You chicks leave us out to dry.  You know, they're all talk.  At least, you know, I'm not all talk.  That's right.  I have confidence in our ladies.  Someone will show up and there will be something going on on that lesbian guy before 7 o'clock. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Well, tick tock, tick tock.  Well, if you only know more ways than one.  All right.  Well, I just wanted to check in and say hello and definitely think about the sticker stop  on Long Island because then we were also talking about getting on the back of the  cop's motorcycle and helping people wow.  Yes, we will do that.  Okay.  Kimmy, we'll set that up very soon.  Thanks for calling me.  All right, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Nice.  We need a woman here.  Laura has a question for Jamie from Time Out New York.  Laura. 
[02:04:30]  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  We're hanging with Jamie.  He's the guy that writes the sexpert column in the back there.  Do you answer those things yourself or do you have to go to other people sometimes?  Yeah, sometimes I go to other people.  You do?  Yeah.  How did you get into the position where all of a sudden you're knowledgeable enough that  you feel you can give people advice?  That's kind of weird.  Well, I mean, look at Dear Abby.  You know, if she can do it.  Right.  Just about anybody can do it.  Write testimonial on yourself.  Hey, if she can do it, come on.  She doesn't know crap either. 
[02:05:00]  No, I give good advice.  Yeah.  But I didn't go to school to give good advice.  But, you know.  All right.  I mean, that's common sense.  Well, honest answer.  I don't want to hear any PhDs or nothing like that.  You got any or no PhDs?  No, no PhDs.  Good.  I like it better that way.  It's more you get a more human response.  Well, Laura has...  I'm looking for George W.  It works for me.  Yeah.  Laura has a question for Jamie.  Laura.  All right.  I was wondering.  I consider myself bisexual.  I've had one lesbian affair in my life. 
[02:05:30]  But I'm trying to have another.  And I don't know how to approach a girl.  I've been to strip clubs for the past eight months with my boyfriend.  And either the girls that are willing to do it, we know they have some sort of disease  going on down there.  And I don't want to do that.  Or...  Laura.  You know, my boyfriend just like hooked her girl out.  Laura, you're hopping your car.  Laura, we have a...  It could not be simpler.  Laura, we have a girl in the studio right now waiting to give you your lesbian experience.  I'm in Jersey and I don't want to be on camera.  Just come back into the room with your tongue out.  And you're having an experience. 
[02:06:00]  You know, seriously, most girls don't go that way.  Well, Jamie, what could this fine lady do?  Well, this is the reason God created the Internet.  You know, like, tool around on that for a while.  Find someone that you feel comfortable with even talking to and to feel comfortable meeting  with them and then see where things go.  And then hook up with the six-foot-tall man that said he was a lesbian woman.  I couldn't imagine.  And you hear sometimes people that hook up on the Internet and stuff and it ends up fine. 
[02:06:30]  But most of the time, all you hear are the horror stories.  So I couldn't imagine hooking up on the Internet.  Well, I think people need to send their photos and, you know, you have to have a certain level of trust.  Yeah, I guess.  You know what?  I met a girl at a bar and we were making out, but her boyfriend dragged her away from me  because she was jealous, so I didn't get her number or anything.  Oh, wow.  I would love to check that out.  I can't find a girl that goes both ways like me.  I just want it to be me and her, not me, her and her boyfriend or anything like that.  Just the two of us. 
[02:07:00]  Right.  Well, Christine's on the line with you, Laura.  Christine, could you give her advice?  Hi.  How you doing, Laura?  Hi, Christine.  How are you?  Good.  So you just wanted to be you and another girl?  Me?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can't say that?  Sorry.  No, you can't.  For some reason, you can't say that.  Just say when you're pleasuring yourself.  When I'm pleasuring myself, I think about other girls.  I never think about guys.  So do I.  Weird.  Huh?  I think we're on a vibe here, me and you. 
[02:07:30]  Well, when you're pleasuring yourself, how come you think about women?  Why do you seem to find yourself thinking about them?  Because women are much more beautiful than men.  Men are not good looking when they're naked.  And they're much more sensual, too.  Exactly.  If they know where to go.  I'm feeling great about myself right about now.  I mean, I'll go to strip clubs alone just to get lap dances because I like them, but  I can't seem to...  Why?  Don't... 
[02:08:00]  Don't...  Why is an insult like that hot, though?  I'm very torn.  Because all men like to see two women together.  Exactly.  Whether they want a man in the middle or not.  To know that.  So, Christine, where can Laura go?  Really, what it is, it's really difficult, to be honest.  I've been a bisexual for about five years, six years.  I'm 24.  I'm a young'un.  It's really difficult, you know, as you said, with the diseases and stuff like that.  You want to make sure you're with someone that's clean. 
[02:08:30]  It's going to take time.  It takes a while to find someone.  You just have to look.  You can get the vibe.  You know when a girl is interested.  You know, if everyone goes up to girls who are sold, you go both ways.  I'm like, that's not...  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work that way.  We also have Celeste in the studio.  You're bisexual, right?  I'm a lesbian.  I have a girlfriend.  No men?  No men right now.  Any advice for Laura?  I do have advice for Laura.  Laura, I met my girlfriend in a lesbian bar.  Have you ever been to any of those? 
[02:09:00]  No, I don't know where any are.  And I'm in New Jersey.  I mean, I can get into Manhattan.  Look at the names of them.  You can pretty much figure it out.  What is that one?  The C-L-I...  That's wow.  Yeah.  That one.  Let's go have a drink at the Sitting Taco.  The Little Man in the Boat.  Right.  The Little Man in the Boat.  Are there any...  I mean, they're all in the Manhattan, though, unfortunately.  No, there's some on Long Island.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, out east.  Go out east on Sunrise Highway.  You can find some, definitely. 
[02:09:30]  Take Sunrise Highway out east.  Is this a lesbian bar on Long Island?  Yeah.  Yes, I know this.  What's the name of it?  Rainbow.  What town is that in?  It's out east.  I believe it's in Central Ice Clips.  Hmm.  It's on Sunrise Highway.  See, all that time, I just thought it was on the water, and it was low tide out there in the ice clip.  But it turns out that it was a...  Stop it.  It's a stupid, cheap joke I was going on.  All right, Laura.  We're going to let you go. 
[02:10:00]  All right, thank you.  Thank you, Christine.  All right, thank you, guys.  Bye.  Okay, bye.  Bye-bye.  All right, where's the girl for Celeste?  Now I'm starting to get a little nervous.  Come on.  Any updates, Rick?  Where's the girl that was in the tunnel?  She's probably...  If she's still listening, give us a call.  Tell us how close you are, okay?  Celeste is patiently waiting to have her lesbian experience.  Is she still on the sticky cam?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And what's that website we have to give out in case they can't see on the...  PleasureVIP.com.  Yes, PleasureVIP.com.  See nude photos of me.  And you can also see my movies. 
[02:10:30]  Okay.  Should we take a break and then get into the next segment, Anthony?  Yes.  The reason all of our porno is now here in the studio again and not in our office.  And it has something to do with Stalker Patty.  Oh, wow.  What do you do with porn?  She's not doing porn, is she?  What is that thing?  It's a birthday present for you.  What the hell am I going to do with this?  I want you to put it on.  Oh, yeah.  You slide it on your junk?  Yes.  And then you push the little thing up to tighten it? 
[02:11:00]  Yes.  And then what happens?  It's like a little bolo tie for your schlong.  But you're hanging it.  Yeah.  It comes with a little craws you can set on fire.  What do you use of that?  A little schlong winching.  But it says it's like a whip.  What?  Yes.  It's a whip.  Oh, is it supposed to kind of gently whip an area that you're kind of letting it dangle  from?  You get it up, right?  Let me see.  That's going to look awfully silly, though.  Yeah.  There's that silly factor when you're trying things like this. 
[02:11:30]  Bright orange.  Bright orange.  Yeah, exactly.  Let me see that.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a C-ring whip.  It looks like a bolo tie for my junk.  Yeah.  But it is.  It is a bolo tie, dude.  Look at it.  Why not black?  They could have made it black or white.  I chose that color.  It's just an odd color.  It's like something a crossing guard wears when you wave to someone. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  And then it gently slaps against a very sensitive area of a girl.  Okay.  Jake, what's up?  Thank you for the present slide.  Hey, there you go.  Jake.  Yeah.  What's up?  Baba booty.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You got us.  Wow.  That went right to our soul.  Wow.  All right.  Let's take a break.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1027. 
[02:12:30]  Stalker Patty and the porno box is next.  All the news you need to know.  And boom.  This is W.O.W., the Wow Radio Station.  W.N.E.W.  Hey, Anthony, New York Sports Clubs.  O.P., New York Sports Clubs.  You have your membership?  Yeah, totally enjoying it.  Going?  You're feeling good about yourself?  Yeah.  I would say so.  Working out on the cardio machines.  They got really nice cardio machines.  They got it all.  We were talking to these guys a little while back when they first came on board. 
[02:13:00]  And they get all the newest machines.  You're not going to go in there and see these old, rusty, clunky machines.  They update these things.  I think they were saying they get a new piece and rotate machinery.  Like every two months, a new piece of machinery comes in, something old leaves.  So you're all on modern machinery.  And if you don't want to use the machines and you want to do something else like exercise classes,  they got plenty of those, too.  They got the cycling, boxing, boot camp, yoga, Pilates, Opie. 
[02:13:30]  Is that how you say it?  I don't know.  I think that's a chick workout thing.  Pilates?  Pilates.  Cultural dance and ultimate conditioning.  You never get bored.  Call them up.  1-800-301-1231.  1-800-301-1231.  What else can you tell the people about New York Sports Club, Opie?  Well, the most important thing, 75 locations.  So they're everywhere.  Yeah.  And you can do the month-to-month memberships, which is very important.  Yeah, you don't get locked in.  If you try it out, if you're like, yeah, it's not my thing, then, you know, you're not out a lot of money. 
[02:14:00]  But I think you're going to be very happy with New York Sports Clubs.  Yeah.  They have special joining rates in effect right now.  So call New York Sports Clubs to find the club nearest you.  1-800-301-1231.  That's 1-800-301-1231.  New York Sports Clubs.  There's a million reasons to join.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All, all, all, all.  By Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNW New York. 
[02:14:30]  From the Tomb Raider soundtrack, Nine Inch Nails, D.  So in a hang with Jim Norton and Jamie from Time Out, New York.  She writes the Sexford column for the magazine.  Also, we got Celeste who's willing to give someone their first lesbian experience.  We have some girls that called, said they're on their way.  We'll have to wait and see what happens with that, right?  Yeah.  Tell Celeste I am a lesbian.  Well, too late. 
[02:15:00]  Jim Norton already said that.  Oh, he did?  Jim wants to put on a dress and a wig if no one else shows up.  What's up, Jay?  Hi, Jimmy.  How you doing, buddy?  I'll do the dress.  I can't get with the wig.  I got a cool haircut.  I told the guy, make me look like I sing in one of those British bands.  Hey, did you guys see Shrek?  Not yet.  I heard it.  Unbelievable.  I heard it's a great movie.  It's unbelievable.  I'm going to see that before Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, I saw it.  I'll see it again.  I'll see it with you.  People are starting to trash the Pearl Harbor now.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Saying it's just a big la-la love story thing.  I'll see it just to watch the Japanese planes go down.  That's what I said.  Well, they don't.  Some of them do.  I saw Ben Affleck with his big machine gun.  Oh, is he in that?  Yeah, he's in that.  You know something?  No.  I think the only time the jet planes go down is when they drop a big torpedo and then they  go back up again.  When they land in Japan, mission accomplished.  When they land on Easter Island.  Ha ha, that was fun. 
[02:16:00]  They never saw us coming.  We sure are so damn.  Hey, Jay, you in New York?  No, I'm in L.A.  Aren't you doing Regis' show again?  Yes, my friend.  You guys want to go?  I would love to.  Now you're in.  Jay Moore is sitting in for Regis Philbin.  It's going to be wonderful.  Fantastic.  You guys can go.  Because last time they were like, let's see how it goes first.  But I think it went well enough last time that I'll just say these are my friends and  they're with me.  So what are they going to do?  Turn us away?  So you're going to fill in for Regis?  I'm filling in for Regis.  Because Kelly's going to have that baby any day. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  And then it's going to be Regis and JJ.  You follow me?  It could be your lucky day.  She gives birth live on TV.  She's probably praying to break her water all over Joan Rivers' lap.  Punch her in the stomach.  Holy cow.  You know, you've got to bring it to that level.  What the F?  Jesus.  I don't even know how to respond to that.  Don't worry.  Because maybe you don't.  Don't worry.  Because no one heard it.  Because they jumped out of that one.  Oh, my God.  So, yeah.  I got satin sheets.  My wife brought home satin sheets three nights ago. 
[02:17:00]  I almost broke my neck.  You guys got satin sheets?  Oh, please.  Sandy strikes me as a gal that will make you get the satin sheets.  I've got to get the satin sheets.  I don't get them.  They sound all well and fine and nice, but after one use of the satin sheet, it's like  a graham cracker.  Right.  But worse than that, I was so excited to get down to, like, husband and wife business in  the satin sheets, because I never had it happen before.  I go running in naked.  I jump on the bed.  I slide across.  I land on the floor on the other side of the goddamn room. 
[02:17:30]  I went across that bed like it was an air hockey table.  My wife comes in.  She's like, what are you doing on the floor?  Like, it was a rain delay at Shea.  There you go.  Roll the tarp out.  Women are meant for the satin sheets, because they're soft, and, you know, women are good.  Like, I don't know about you.  My feet are all freaking messed up.  I've got corns where I've got venereal warts removed from scars.  You know, every bunion, every imperfection you have as a man, every hair on your body makes 
[02:18:00]  a sound in the satin sheets.  My wife thinks I've got freaking crickets in my underpants.  Not only that, when you're laying down on your back or something, and you pull them  up over you, you might as well, it's like you see every nook and cranny of your body.  Yeah, and you also feel like you're laying in a freezer.  Every time I get in and out of the bed, it's like a Three Stooges movie.  Not warm, not absorbent, either.  No, and a wet spot stays a wet spot for a very long time with the satin sheets.  It pulls up on you.  You don't just lay the little towel on top of the wet spot on the satin sheets. 
[02:18:30]  It's a whole production.  Oh, look what you did to the satin sheets.  Yeah, it pulls up like a, it's like mercury in the palm of your hand.  Right.  Sliding around.  Jay, how's your sperm count?  It's low.  Still low, huh?  Doesn't matter, though.  I'm dropping them off right at the door.  Yeah.  I'm dropping them right off.  I'm putting them through the mail slot.  I'm going to have that big, fat lefty.  You think so?  Yeah, I know so. 
[02:19:00]  Hey, we were talking about Coney earlier.  How pathetic does he look in that Red Sox uniform?  Well, he made the decision.  He could have retired like Doc with some dignity.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah.  He had nothing left in his arm.  How pathetic is El Duque dotting the Japs to keep the hit streak alive?  What was that about?  That's Bush, man.  I don't like that.  Between the five and the one.  Prank.  Prank.  And then the prick, it goes to extra innings, so it didn't even work.  Yeah.  The guy had another shot. 
[02:19:30]  What, are you going to hit the Japs twice?  You can't hit the Japs twice.  How about when Hideo Nomo hit Ishiro Suzuki?  America's game, my ass.  You got two Japs spotting each other in Safeco Field owned by freaking Nintendo.  What happened?  Well, I mean, the Nullicans are one thing, but then they all come over from Japs.  And now I'm not talking Jewish American princesses.  No.  I mean the real deal.  These are real Japs.  Speaking of Pearl Harbor.  This is the new Pearl Harbor.  They're going to be playing the All-Star game this year.  They're attacking the baseball teams.  Pearl Harbor. 
[02:20:00]  Let me tell you something.  The All-Star game is at Safeco Field this year, and I've got a funny feeling.  It's going to be six feet underwater, and we're going to look at it as a museum when  they're done with it.  They're going to bomb.  You got Nomo will be there.  Ishiro will be there.  Max Suzuki, the closer from Seattle, will be there.  It's going to be a Japs festival.  Hey, Jay, could you do me a favor?  Yes, sir.  I need to hear the Jay Moore voice beyond the glory.  Okay, ready?  Yeah.  I saw the Carl Malone one.  It was great. 
[02:20:30]  That's a good one.  When his son can't speak English, he's like, I want that.  I shoot like him.  I want that.  I rebound like him.  Every time I take a dizzle, people say dip like him, and I'm just sitting there like,  bam.  That's exactly what the kid said.  The whole Carl Malone family looks like the clumps.  When they showed his mother with the wig on, I was like, no, rewind that, because I  don't believe I just saw Carl Malone dressed up like an old lady.  Classic.  Well, he had two kids with another woman and just kind of blew the kids off and met up.  No, no, no, no.  Carl Malone's a good guy.  He didn't know he had them. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, he didn't know he had them.  When he found out he had them, the second he found out, he went to visit them.  And as soon as you look at them, they look just like him, even the girl, you know?  You're right.  You're right.  The girl's a moose.  She should be above a fireplace.  They're really tall.  At the Gorton's Lodge meeting.  Do the Beyond the Glory voice, because I didn't even know it was you the first few  times I saw that show.  Right.  I come in under the radar.  You guys don't even know.  Go ahead.  Do the voice.  Just miles from the sandy beaches of Long Island Sound, Opie and Anthony started their  dream.  They went to Boston, were soon fired. 
[02:21:30]  But through that tragedy, they found hope.  New York-based 102.7 Infinity Broadcasting took them on a wire, and the rest is history.  This is Opie and Anthony, Beyond the Glory.  Jim Norton was caught in Central Park with a prostitute, eating her where she sits down.  Five years later, his tongue fell out of his head, and he tossed to his mittens.  This is Jim Norton, Beyond the Glory. 
[02:22:00]  Rich Ross, Middle.  Rich Ross is open for the Pointer Sisters, David Brenner, and other people that aren't  quite celebrities.  He's always as good as making fun of comics when he's on the radio, but when he does a  show live, it's the same four minutes you saw when he did Death Jam.  He could do a show in front of a Ku Klux Klan rally, and still open with, look at the black  girl checking me out.  This is Rich Ross, Beyond the Glory that he never had. 
[02:22:30]  He thought a tattoo, a haircut, and tapping his teeth would put him over the top.  He was wrong.  You're watching Opie and Anthony, Beyond the Glory.  Wow, that is brutal.  That's great.  Hold on a second, Jay.  We have a girl here for Celeste.  Priscilla.  What?  Will someone go park her car?  I don't care.  Hold on, Jay.  Hold on. 
[02:23:00]  What happened?  Priscilla.  Priscilla.  Priscilla.  Yes?  Where are you?  I'm right in front of the building.  What are you, 70 years old?  Jay, you're going to reen it.  Not hardly.  You're going to reen it.  Jay, we've got to work some pimp hands today.  She's coming up to do a little lesbian thing.  Priscilla, what do you look like?  Most people say I look like Jada Pinkett Smith.  Wow.  Yeah, baby.  With a body like Marion Jones.  I'll be right over. 
[02:23:30]  I don't want you, though.  I don't want you, though.  Hold on, hold on.  No, you don't have to have me.  I'm just singing my praises of you.  Yes, without a doubt.  Hold on a second, Priscilla.  As long as we have a woman coming in, because all we have right now is Stalker Patty with  the physique of a turnip root.  I've got to tell you guys something.  I went on the website and saw naked Stalker Patty photos.  Yeah.  I was oddly, pleasantly surprised.  Were you?  A lot of people said that, strangely enough.  And I think she's got it bad for Walter.  She wants the black tar paper. 
[02:24:00]  You think so?  She gave him her cell phone number.  Wow.  That is so funny.  I told you guys that.  That is old news.  Well, wait until you hear the latest about Stalker Patty.  I'm coming in Tuesday, guys.  Oh, good.  Nice.  I'll be there Wednesday morning to do the Regis and Kelly Thursday and Friday.  Yes.  And then we're taking it over to West Orange.  Don't do too good a job.  I'm an Emmy Award winner.  Don't screw up my program.  He won a daytime Emmy for that Millionaire Show.  But how did he win the host of the Millionaire Show for Best Game Show Host? 
[02:24:30]  Like Alex Trebek, he kind of works it.  Like, you can tell he kind of knows some stuff.  And then they have these other game show hosts that got to know about flipping frigging things going on on the set.  Regis sits there.  He knows nothing about the questions that are being asked.  The guy is a complete idiot.  And he wins the award.  You think there are three sides to a triangle?  Yeah.  You're sure?  Yeah.  I had no clue about that.  I thought a triangle, tri meaning four. 
[02:25:00]  I would have called Gelman.  Gelman, what the hell is a triangle?  Are you definitely going to come to Regis and Kelly?  We would love to.  I hope she gives birth right on my lap.  Imagine we run out from the audience to assist.  That'd be the fact.  Jay delivers the baby live.  You know what they're saying in newspapers?  What?  WNEW hosts help.  Yeah, yeah.  Wacky radio stunt.  You could have saved the kid's life.  They'd be like, and radio personalities from a place did something.  After they deliver a big cab, trips and lands on it. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Do you have a toothpaste that somebody jumped on in the middle?  What if it comes on and looks just like Big Kev?  Big Kev's got that big secret.  And then Kelly.  Kelly Ripper.  He has a lot of secrets.  Kelly.  Jay, we've got to let you go, because we're going to get this lesbian thing going.  Bring the lesbians to Rascals.  Oh, you're going to be at Rascals?  I just booked it.  Oh, wow.  We thought we were going to get a free phone call from Jay Moore.  No, no, no. 
[02:26:00]  I called to do the satin sheets joke.  Door deal?  Nice.  Door deal?  Me?  Yeah.  Always.  Oh, God.  Nice, nice.  The satin sheet joke to open?  No, I'm going to do that on Regis and Kelly, I think, because it's nice and clean.  Yeah, they'll go for that.  But I wanted to give the respect to the listeners first.  Nice.  All right, Jay, when at Rascals?  Now you make me show dirty.  Oh, Jay, we were just kidding.  You know that.  I call you anyway when I have nothing to plug.  We know that.  That was fun when I was there. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, you've got to get to lesbians.  I understand.  Okay.  Jay, seriously, we're just kidding.  I'm actually splitting it up, because Brewer's there in West Orange on Saturday, on the 2nd,  so I'm going to go to Ocean Township on Saturday.  But Thursday, Friday, and Sunday, I'm in West Orange.  West Orange of next week, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, right?  Yeah.  So I'm going to do the Regis and Kelly and parlay it into a...  You know what?  I don't know how I'm going to get up at 5 in the morning and just stand up at 10 o'clock  at night.  Yeah, that's a long day.  Yeah, well, thank God I take naps. 
[02:27:00]  Well, it's rascalscomedyclub.com, because now you're just confused everyone.  But they'll figure it out from there.  Yeah, but I want to make sure you guys get down with me for Regis and Kelly, because last  time I felt bad, because they weren't sure of what to do with anybody.  Yeah.  That's all I know.  We're going to go in there and do blow off the coffee table.  They don't know where normal guys are.  No, we'll have a good time.  All right, Jay, we've got to fly.  Hey, have fun.  And the website is really, really awesome.  And I'm getting everybody in L.A.  All my friends are totally into you guys.  It's just a matter of time.  Keep up the awesome work, man.  You guys are so funny. 
[02:27:30]  All right, Jay.  I can't wait to come back in town just to be able to listen to you when I'm walking around.  Thank you, Jay.  For the man.  See you, Jay.  Take it easy.  There he goes.  Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Winner of the Golden Hangar.  We're parking Priscilla's car.  Parking the car.  Celeste, you ready?  Yeah, can you see her?  No, I know.  That's just it.  Not yet.  God, well.  Let me pray.  How about the car?  Is the car at least a four?  Please make her, like, hot enough.  Oh, yeah, she's really ugly.  You can just eat the gas tank. 
[02:28:00]  Oh.  Oh.  She's going to be hot.  I hope so.  I hope she's hot.  Look what's in here now, so anything's an improvement.  Do you want to start the Stalker Patty thing with the porno thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that.  And then, all right, get Patty in here real fast.  Way too.  There's a new Patty.  There's a brand new Patty.  Remember in the old days, Patty, very shy, very subdued.  Now we're seeing pretty much nude pictures of her.  She's out at all the events now. 
[02:28:30]  She's looking to hook up.  She's giving guys her cell phone number.  And now, now we find out.  Patty, what were you telling Rick outside?  You want to experiment with viewing?  Oh, no.  I'm just curious about a magazine called Over 40 for people my age.  I was wondering what was in it.  But I will not go to a newsstand and buy it because I don't know what the person behind the counter would think of buying it.  Well, believe me, the Over 40 is nothing compared to the stuff they've doled out at a lot of those newsstands. 
[02:29:00]  Really?  So I wouldn't worry about it.  But you don't know what Over 40, do you have any clue what Over 40 magazine is?  Probably soft porn pictures and stuff like that.  What, are you just trying to size yourself up?  You're trying to size yourself up?  No, I'm not sure.  You're going to kind of look at some of the Over 40 women and say, hey, you know, I'm pretty good compared to this.  Or are you thinking of maybe calling them up and saying, hey, posing? 
[02:29:30]  No, just reading and checking out the magazine to see what it's about.  Because, Patty, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of getting some vibe here.  Are you thinking about maybe making a couple of bucks by posing in Over 40?  Because they probably pay very well and you're always short on money.  I don't know if I'd have the nerve to do that.  It would be read by millions of people.  Not that issue.  I don't know.  I'm Dan Norton.  Beautiful.  I've never had anybody make me nauseous talking about pornography before. 
[02:30:00]  He's a sexaholic, too, man.  You just turned a sexaholic off.  Is there an inkling in your head that you would want to do this for probably a good chunk of change?  I don't know.  See, Anthony, I'm having a problem here.  Patty, can you pull your pants down a little bit?  They're as high as your nipples.  No, I'm not.  Your pants are really up high.  They were a little high today, Patty.  Do you have to toil with over or under the bunt every morning when you pull them up? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Because I'm thinking under bunt.  Because then the shirt, because the over bunt, it accentuates.  Do you think ladies have to decide, do I go over it or under it?  Absolutely.  I think ladies, if they have the bunt, they have to decide, am I pulling the pants above it?  And not even pulling, you've got to buy the pants or else they'll be, so you've got to make the decision in the store.  All right, I'm over bunt.  Now, I've totally lost any hope, you know.  But under bunt, you can wear something loose.  A little sea belly can be erotic, actually. 
[02:31:00]  Well.  It's not bad.  Do you think so?  Yeah.  Just a tad, a little bit.  Hey, we've got Bill on the line?  Yeah.  Avid reader of over 40.  Bill.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Listen, over 40, it's a good magazine for guys who like older women.  They've got about 10 girls in there.  About 8 of them are pretty hot.  2 of them are pigs.  All right.  I mean, you can go either way with her.  Oh, stop.  I've never seen her, Patty.  But, you know, like I said, there's about 8 girls that are pretty hot. 
[02:31:30]  And they put the 2 pigs in the back.  In the back of the book.  All right.  Our lesbian just showed up.  Uh-oh.  So.  Okay.  Hey, you guys are great, man.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks.  Take it easy.  Well, Patty, we heard a rumor that.  Hold on.  Rick, hold that for a second.  We heard a rumor that you were starting to get into the porno.  And we have a few pornos we want you to check out.  Patty, we would like you to screen a couple of these pornos and then come back and let us know.  But I don't have a VCR. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Stinky, Stinky, if you will, put the box of pornos next to Patty.  Patty, pull out a couple of the pornos and just give your comments of what you're checking out.  Yeah, because there's pictures on the boxes.  Yeah, she's got century sex in her hand.  Oh, well, that's disgusting.  Box of pizza, yeah.  Now, give her something a little more in line with what she might be interested in.  Yeah, she's pulling out another one from the box.  Bumping Granny?  Yeah, that's another old one. 
[02:32:30]  What's that one called?  Bumping Granny.  Talking to the mic.  That's another old one, though.  I know.  Don't go to the old, broad ones.  What's that one?  Older and anal.  How about that?  Weird.  She's got to start slow, though.  You know what I mean?  What do you think of that one, Patty?  Take a look at some of the pictures on the back.  Oh, they're all older, of course.  No.  All right, what about that one? 
[02:33:00]  She looks like Naomi Campbell.  What's the name of that one?  Joey Silveira's Rug Adventures, number eight.  Rug Adventures?  Rug Adventures.  There's just a big-ass female?  Yeah.  You know what a female is, Patty?  I guess a he-she.  A he-she.  I know what they are.  Put that in my pile.  Oh, no.  I guess a guy that's got the female parts.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I don't know.  Look, she's getting all embarrassed. 
[02:33:30]  Patty, what about the one you got in your hand now?  Which one's that?  An old lady.  What about seven?  Granny Interracial Gang Bang.  A couple of the guys was young enough to-  Gang bang.  Granny Interracial Gang Bang.  Oh, no.  Another line that no one will hear.  Yeah.  I don't think that made it.  Sorry.  They're sexy. 
[02:34:00]  Whatever, Betty.  Ready to drop.  I know.  It's funny.  Ready to drop.  What is that one?  Well, I guess she is.  She's pregnant.  Oh, the preggers.  Yeah, yeah.  Some people love those.  Would you like to check out the pregnant porno thing there?  No.  Nothing.  How can you do that and be pregnant?  All right.  What do you got in your hand now?  Itsy-bitsy.  Like spiders.  No, that's girls with tiny little boobies.  That's like you.  I have an itsy-bitsy. 
[02:34:30]  You're like itsy-bitsy.  Yeah.  What about that one, Patty?  Wild queens.  Hot transsexual sex.  Oh, there you go.  Nice.  Not gay if nobody finds out.  What is that one, Patty?  You're just in-handed?  Okay.  Chunky chicks number 11.  Junkie chicks?  Oh, there's so many unanswered questions.  Oh, chunky.  I thought junkie chicks, and I was going to take that one for all of a sudden.  I like that.  Nice.  Nice. 
[02:35:00]  Junkies.  So what do you think?  Any of those pornos interest you?  Patty, what about the one you're being handed now?  What's the name of that?  Sweet Cheeks.  Good, bad, girl, bad.  All right.  Good, good girl, bad girl.  Oh, good girl, bad girl.  What about the one you're holding?  What about the one you're holding?  Uh, sperm-o-vidar.  Please don't jump out of that.  Be sorry.  It doesn't mean anything. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Which one's that, Patty?  This is our own personal collection.  Yeah, by the way, you know, it's funny to listen to Patty Davis,  but this is all of our movies that we have in the back office.  Did you see all of these movies?  Not all of them, Patty.  I was going to say my grandma is a whore.  Which one's that?  My grandma is a whore.  That's the name of it?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were just commenting. 
[02:36:00]  She's losing her mind.  This is, this is, yeah.  Life in the fat way.  She's like a retard looking at a ferris wheel.  I love it.  You're giggling like a retard.  The box is so colorful.  I want to eat it.  I can't help it.  Colorful, like a yearly wrench.  All right.  Could you see you're watching, Patty?  Could you watch one of these, you think, and make yourself...  At the portal?  Yeah.  No, I don't know.  You don't think if you fired one of these up and kind of looked at it that you would be 
[02:36:30]  able to manipulate yourself into a frenzy?  I don't know if I'd do it.  It's a choice, chunky chick with Earthquake.  Earthquake is in that one?  I love her.  Earthquake.  I'd be caught in an earthquake.  Patty, any of these pornos interest you, though?  We're just trying to get a feel for what you might be into.  Everyone gets a little freaky.  Yeah, everyone's got a freaky side.  A little freaky.  A freaky.  A Tokyo torture chamber.  Oh, nice. 
[02:37:00]  That could be good.  Double the pain.  Yeah, are you into the pain, the spanking, the...  No.  Nipple clamps?  When I have it with a special somebody, I want it to be a loving experience.  Oh, yeah.  Special somebody.  Yeah.  Special somebody.  You know, I have this little birthday present for you.  Ah.  A birthday present.  Yes.  If you really know Opie, it should involve you in a tub with a razor blade and Jim Croce songs. 
[02:37:30]  He's funny.  I want to make a movie, Opie.  All right, let's take a look at your gift.  Okay.  Yeah.  Here you go.  Look at those hot pants.  It's a bag full of stuff.  First, it's a card.  Oh, my God, there's a little heart on it.  Oh, I love you, Opie.  I put a heart on this card, and I'm hoping to get your heart on.  Happy birthday. 
[02:38:00]  I appreciate the hours of pleasure you bring to me.  Pleasure.  When I listen to the story.  Oh, of course.  It's funny, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is for you.  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, your year.  One of those things.  You went to the store and...  That's your real first.  Guess your year.  What the hell is...  This is going to be...  I'm going to play Karnak.  Karnak.  The great and powerful Karnak. 
[02:38:30]  Ho, ho, ho.  Gift certificate.  Oh, okay.  Well, you could know it's a gift certificate, because what else comes in an envelope like that?  Just couldn't give you cash.  To Fuji Restaurant.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, Opie.  How...  You were born in the year of the rabbits, so...  Oh, so you got a bunny rabbit, Opie.  Here's a can of beer.  Now, the other two things...  And here's my ovaries.  I cut them out just for you. 
[02:39:00]  I also remembered Sandy, and she was born around Decoration Day, so I gave her a red, white, and some of the hair.  It's a beanie, baby.  Who helped you pick these out, a mongoloid?  Well, Patty, thank you so much.  Fantastic.  If you notice, nothing's breakable.  She's learning.  Come in there and eat whatever you want.  They'll give you sore friends. 
[02:39:30]  Eat whatever I want.  Wow.  I think I could get a half a word of edamame.  Thank you.  Oh.  What's the matter, Patty?  Didn't quite have the chance.  No, it's lovely.  How much is it for, Opie?  How much?  $7.50.  $7.50?  Nice.  Nice.  That's not a gift certificate.  That's good.  Yeah.  Is that a gift certificate for $7.50?  It's not.  Don't fill up.  Don't fill up. 
[02:40:00]  All right.  Thank you, Patty.  Very nice.  All right.  She'll hate it.  Thank you, Patty.  Do I have the rice that came off the rag?  She's a grown woman.  She will not like the bear.  It's a beanie baby.  It's a beanie baby bear.  I want a birthday hug.  How about a make-out session?  Yeah.  Could I have a tongue kiss and a...  No.  I'll give you a BJ.  Patty, come on.  You're making me uncomfortable.  Would you just pat me on the back? 
[02:40:30]  How about a hug and your finger is ghouly?  Ghouly.  All right.  Here's a hug.  A little hug.  Oh, look.  Could I give you a rub and a tug with a happy ending?  Opie, I speak Greek.  You know what I mean.  Thank you.  I speak Greek, Opie.  Thank you, Patty.  I'll cherish your gifts.  I'll offer you some pleasures that involve things that I... 
[02:41:00]  Put it this way.  As I'm doing it, I won't be able to whistle.  All right, listen.  We got a...  We got a...  Yeah, we got a break.  Okay.  Back to our action, Opie.  I gave myself an enema so it'll be clean.  Oh, man.  Squeaky clean.  I learned from the porn star yesterday.  You got to give yourself an enema.  Keeps it squeaky clean. 
[02:41:30]  What do you say, Opie?  I speak Greek.  I speak French, too.  All right, listen.  We got to get Celeste in the lesbian couch.  Double penetrate and bring Norton.  You're actually sexier saying that than...  We'll finish up this mess next.  You have 30 seconds to wear on you.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out. 
[02:42:00]  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Planet Java, Opie.  How about for your birthday I do the Motley Crue challenge?  The guy just turned gay because he was listening to you?  Jimmy.  Oh, Anthony.  You turned me gay, baby.  Could you stimulate me with your brisly mustache?  Well, leave them my number. 
[02:42:30]  And Planet Java.  Yes.  The coolest thing to hit the streets this spring.  Iced coffee.  It's called Planet Java.  Great tasting Planet Java.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  A message to the Planet Java people?  Yeah.  Running out of Javadelic.  We are running out of Javadelic.  New shipment.  Please hurry.  Great tasting Planet Java is out to kick the competition's butt.  So keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks, the street patrol coming to an area  near you with cool new flavors, the Javadelic, of course, Caramoca, and Tremble, if you 
[02:43:00]  want to shake things up.  Javadelic.  Opie loves this stuff.  It's a perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Caramoca, caramel, and chocolate in a coffee.  And Tremble gives you that boost with 121 milligrams of caffeine.  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  You get the idea.  Tremble does the trick deliciously.  Well, I have this thing in town, Planet Java, iced coffee with an attitude, Opie.  Available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold. 
[02:43:30]  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, yell at them.  It's a man that gets the Planet Java.  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  Planet Java.  Gentlemen, you're wacky.  Are you messing me naked?  Overload.  Pleasure overload.  Oh, I hope that's me, Tremble.  All right, we just have a few minutes left in the program today. 
[02:44:00]  Now finish it up and stop.  We've got to step aside for Donna Mike there, broadcasting from New York.  You'll hear the results starting at 7 o'clock tonight.  Yeah.  They're on when we're on, officially.  And then we, you know, re-broadcast the show after we get off the air.  Really?  We've got Jim Norton in the studio, who killed today once again.  Devin from Home Alone, who hasn't even been able to say anything.  He didn't rate today.  He's just been waiting in the lobby for the last hour and a half.  He's been molesting to us. 
[02:44:30]  And, of course, Jamie from Time Out New York, who did a great job for us today.  Jamie, are you going to come back?  Yeah, I'd love to come back.  Oh, good.  Very good.  He writes the sexpert column in the back of the magazine that we read.  We read his column all the time on the air when he gets those interesting letters.  And, of course, Celeste from PleasureVIP.com.  PleasureVIP.com, yeah, from Pleasure's new VIP contract girl.  Right on.  She's very, very hot.  There's a lot of girl-on-girl vids.  I do all girl-on-girl vids. 
[02:45:00]  All girl-on-girl.  Are we going to get some photos of this for the website?  I've got some.  I don't want to see that.  Now, where's the girl that wants to get it on with you?  Oh, she's hot.  She's ready.  Oh, you're happy?  Hey, there we go.  Wow.  Nice.  Yes.  Nice.  Jada.  Jada Pinkett Smith.  Sure, why not?  I can see it.  Sure.  Thank you.  Your name again?  Priscilla.  Priscilla, that's right.  Priscilla.  What's interested you in maybe having a little lesbian affair here today? 
[02:45:30]  I have law finals and I need to break detention.  You ever been with a girl?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exclusively?  Do you do this?  Yeah.  Oh, you're a total lesbian?  Yeah.  Have you, when was the last time you had a man, if ever?  Remove the cobwebs from my name.  Wow.  Really?  A long time?  You've not experienced the man junk in quite some time?  Don't want to.  But have you ever?  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately?  Wow.  That guy must have really saw. 
[02:46:00]  Jesus Christ.  That's what he didn't do.  Yeah.  Ooh.  See?  I think a lot of times, like, if a guy is gay, I think that's just the thing that happens.  It's in the genes and stuff and that's just what happens.  I think girls, though.  They could happen with girls, too.  But I think some of the time, it's just such a turnoff from guys being so effing lousy  and insensitive in the sack.  They go, screw this.  I'm turning into chicks.  I think that's how it works.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you. 
[02:46:30]  No.  My study, I've been working on for 10 years now, and I'm hoping to get some kind of a  Nobel Prize for it.  I was enjoying that, Anthony.  But, I mean, she's hot.  Yeah.  African.  Nice.  Yeah.  Nice.  We love the sisters.  Thank you.  Opie has been trying for years.  She's got a hookup.  She's got the perfect skin color.  See, Opie likes that.  Yeah.  646.  Mm-hmm.  646.  We've got to see her boobs, though.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah.  Sure.  We'll get there.  Well, Celeste, why don't you show yours first? 
[02:47:00]  We've got a whopping 15 minutes.  Yeah, look at these.  And then tell us what you think.  What can I do with them?  That's nice.  You can do whatever you want.  You can do anything you want.  What do you think?  Nice.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, sure.  Touching.  Yeah, she's using her tongue.  Wow.  Wow, that is a tongue.  That nice, huh?  That was nice, right?  Wow.  That was very nice.  It sure looked like it was nice.  My other side is jealous. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Wow.  Oh.  Tip for you guys.  Use the whole thing.  Down.  Just jot it down.  Tim's jotting.  Jotting.  Look at Devin's actually writing it down.  Right.  Tim wants to be prepared in case there's a pop quiz.  He wrote it down.  Oh, Devin's writing it.  Would you like to see a little of Priscilla now?  I do.  Do you mind?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:48:00]  Not at all.  Oh, Priscilla.  There we go.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  She keeps herself in shape.  She keeps herself in shape.  Get the little belly button ring.  Completely.  She's got a six-pack.  Nice.  I guess.  Yeah.  Six-pack abs.  That's the abs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, sure.  Look at that.  All right.  Yeah, she's working out.  She's working out.  Nice.  Smaller movies, but we like that, too.  Very nice.  Whatever works.  But I know what to do with them.  Oh.  I don't have any complaints. 
[02:48:30]  More than a mouthful is a waste.  Well, you know something?  It is 647, as we speak.  Yes.  So why don't we just...  Usually we like doing a little more talking and getting to know each other.  But you know something?  Screw it.  You girls get right to knowing each other.  And just hit the couch.  We'll dim the lights.  We'll get some music going.  Do we have any Melissa Etheridge or any type of...  I think I can find an Indigo Girl CD.  Something that we can find.  Katie Lang.  Some Katie Lang. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  Whatever works.  There they go.  They're now taking to the couch.  Well, get the mic near the boombox.  Don't call it a boombox, Opie.  Oh.  Oh, the music thing.  Stinky is...  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the two girls are topless on the lesbian couch.  They just met today.  The lights are stilting right around me. 
[02:49:30]  We're just adjusting microphones.  She's hot, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Priscilla is working over Celeste.  On the upper half.  Good day to be a friend of the show.  You've been on a good streak lately, Norton.  You guys are gods.  You have seen a lot of good stuff lately.  They're working all open.  The skirt is coming off.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, Priscilla.  Oh, sure.  Look at that. 
[02:50:00]  Priscilla's skirt.  I have no panties.  Now coming off.  She's got on, oh, a little thong thing.  No, what is that?  Let me see the back.  It's kind of a...  Yeah.  Oh, it's see-through in the back.  See-through?  Wow.  She works out.  Yeah.  You can tell.  She's in great shape.  Celeste is kind of spanking her.  That ass is tight.  Using a little...  She's whipping her ass with a little...  What the hell is that?  It looks like a huge castle that you can see on a graduation cap. 
[02:50:30]  A little spanking.  Priscilla, you liking that?  Feeling good, huh?  Definitely.  Yeah.  Priscilla's very happy right now.  A little...  Oh, a little massaging, caressing of Priscilla's...  A better...  A nicer shot of the gold part.  There we go.  Playing with her...  Where she sits.  Priscilla's got muscles on her back.  I said sits.  Don't look at me like that. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, okay.  Skirts down.  Oh, now...  Now, look at this.  Celeste is taking her dress on.  Your girls just don't even think about us being here.  It's your moment.  It's your moment.  Wow, Celeste down to her panty.  Whoa.  Oh, Priscilla, what do you think of Celeste's body?  Absolutely delicious.  Oh, and she does mean delicious. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  She's unwrapping the package.  Ooh.  It's going in.  Oh, there we go.  Looks like there's a part missing.  Now, we're looking at...  Yeah, normally you would call that a doggy style.  There's a part missing in that little bit.  Yeah.  Oh.  There's some spanking going on.  We've got to get some apparatus in here.  Ooh, wow.  She's really smacking her ass.  That was a big smack there, Priscilla. 
[02:52:00]  That's the type of ass you'd kill your family over.  Thank you, Ken.  Oh, wow.  Look at this.  Mmm.  Oh, I do believe that Priscilla likes to have a tool.  Yeah.  I don't think this is her first time.  Priscilla, you like the strap-on action?  And you like being the guy?  It depends.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Give a little taste.  Right into the cheek.  Ooh, she's kind of pulling at her panties, her teeth. 
[02:52:30]  Priscilla's pulling the panties off a little bit.  Wow.  Oh, now she's getting some real action going.  Hey, is this on the sticky can?  No.  No, huh?  No.  Not allowed?  Not allowed.  Taking some pictures, though, maybe?  Yeah.  Well, Priscilla doesn't want to be on the camera.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  Which is fine.  That's all right.  Screw our listeners.  Oh, we're just kidding.  You girls, let us tell you.  Go as far as you like.  There's no holds barred here on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:53:00]  I'm going to take her home now.  Whatever you guys want to do.  What?  What?  I'm taking her home now.  Yeah.  I need a bed.  And some lube.  Holy Jesus.  You're leaving us hanging.  And your girls can just recline on the couch and go as far as you like.  Trust us.  There wouldn't be a problem.  Well, I think if they want to see Celeste in action, they need to check me out on my new videos.  Oh, no.  We got screwed, Opie. 
[02:53:30]  We're getting screwed here.  We're getting screwed here.  Oh, there's a guy holding money up to the window.  We got to see a lot, Anthony.  That was nice.  I know, but I wanted to see the money shot.  So, let's thank Celeste for stopping by from PleasureVip.com and Priscilla, the star of the show.  I liked it. 
[02:54:00]  I liked it.  She did try.  I'll give Priscilla credit.  She did try to get a tongue in there.  I saw that going on.  That was a real Jim Norton move.  That's a Norton move.  That's a Norton move.  You tell me to drop something in the air, it's right in there.  She's my inspiration.  Oh, I thought we were going to see some of the bush.  That's all right.  We got to get the hell out of here.  Some patch.  Yeah.  Jim, thank you for stopping by.  Thank you, man.  It's always a pleasure.  Jim Norton.  Norton!  You're coming like a semi-regular, and we don't mind that at all. 
[02:54:30]  No.  And Jamie, of course, from Time Out New York.  Thank you, Jamie.  Thank you.  And the girls still kind of playing with each other in the corner.  Okay.  I got a birthday present for you.  Oh, Devin.  Yeah.  Devin's got a present.  It's a gift certificate to Fuji.  I got you a beanie, baby.  A brainy, baby.  I got you the best of barely legal.  Wow.  The best of?  The best of barely.  Oh, at least it's wrapped up like it's supposed to be.  Yeah, here you go.  Wow.  I better keep it wrapped just in case I get pulled over.  When 20 is just too old for you. 
[02:55:00]  Nice.  Look at that.  And I also, because I also know how much you like them, I got you extra large, voluptuous  women.  And this is signed by me.  And I have different pages that are marked to some of the best ones, like the grandma  who doesn't shave.  Nice.  I got some of them, like, there are some that are sort of marked for you, but I signed  it.  Happy, happy birthday to Opie.  I'll never forget the times we shared.  Can't you see the cover of that?  Yeah, by all means.  I knew Norton would go for it. 
[02:55:30]  Hey, Opie, be careful with this magazine.  It looks like he used it already.  Well, some of the pages you can't quite, you can't quite get them to.  She looks like me.  Hey, you can't say that.  I know it, and I love it.  He's talking about Western music.  What?  Country Western music.  Country Western.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony, another birthday and a bunch of gifts I can't take home.  What's the end this year?  Thank you, everybody.  Wonderful.  Thank you.  Hey, that is hot.  Every gift its own felony. 
[02:56:00]  It feels great.  Look at this, man.  Oh, yeah, sure.  That's good.  Real lovely.  That's good stuff.  That's good stuff.  All right, we've got to get the hell out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, man.  Sure.  All right.  Get ready for New!  And New!  With the mouth of the last day!  With the ring, Anthony!  N-E-W. </pre>
