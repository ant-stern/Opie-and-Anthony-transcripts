<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with a lengthy discussion of Arnold Schwarzenegger's infidelity scandal, focusing heavily on graphic details of his affair with his housekeeper, using highly derogatory language to describe her appearance. The hosts speculated on the affair’s motivations and criticized Ian Halperin, author of *The Governator*, for not fully disclosing his knowledge of the scandal earlier.  Listener calls contributed to the discussion.  This segment transitioned into a discussion of the negative online reaction to Joe Rogan’s upcoming appearance on their channel, with the hosts aggressively mocking and insulting the critics, suggesting their objections stemmed from jealousy.  A heated exchange with an unidentified online commenter, believed to be a disgruntled radio personality, ensued.  A caller, Hugh, offered his perspective on the Schwarzenegger situation.  Anthony recounted a past stalker experience that ended after the stalker’s serious car accident.  Anthony also mentioned receiving gas masks from a friend, interpreted as potentially related to an impending end-of-the-world scenario.  The hosts discussed an upcoming fitness challenge involving Bobo, E-Rock, and Roland, leading to a tense exchange with Roland due to his surprise at the weigh-in component. Opie’s wife texted about his repeated singing of a song.

The show then focused on a major dispute regarding the fitness challenge. Roland expressed extreme anger at the surprise weigh-in (or body fat analysis), blaming Dr. Steve, who was on the phone while boarding a plane. Dr. Steve explained a miscommunication with Rob Cross, a member of the show’s management who was in the studio.  Rob Cross attempted to clarify, but his explanations only fueled Roland’s anger, leading to accusations of miscommunication and deception.  The discussion devolved into chaotic personal attacks and unrelated tangents, including a discussion of a previous pizza party and a jokingly made bomb threat during Dr. Steve's call. E-Rock and other staff members joined the argument, escalating the conflict.  The situation culminated in a challenge between E-Rock and Sam Roberts, with bets placed on the outcome.  The challenge's rules, participant number, and potential additions were debated before the segment concluded with the confirmation that the challenge would proceed, involving E-Rock, Sam, and potentially others.

A segment featuring comedian Bill Burr as a guest in studio followed.  The discussion included a wide array of tangents: a goofy Christmas poster;  the Stanley Cup playoffs and hockey; various YouTube videos of fights; further detailed speculation on the Schwarzenegger scandal; baseball; the Clintons' marriage; and the show *The First 48*.  The hosts and Burr frequently referenced specific YouTube videos, though links were not provided.  The segment was punctuated by humorous moments, including running gags about the hosts’ reactions to ridiculous YouTube videos and Burr’s commentary.

Another segment started with a comedic bit about a viral paper towel demonstration video.  This transitioned into a critique of Ted Nugent's appearance on Piers Morgan, focusing on Nugent's persona and a joke about President Obama. The conversation expanded to gun control, societal issues (the American dream, housing costs, taxes, mortgages), and frustrations with banks, insurance companies, and the government, using highly offensive language.  A humorous anecdote about a tax return miscommunication with the IRS was shared.  The segment also included criticism of Larry King’s interviewing style, mentions of Jim Norton's upcoming appearances and a video, and speculation about rumors surrounding Fez.

The broadcast concluded with a chaotic segment where Opie unexpectedly left the studio mid-broadcast.  The remaining host, referred to as "Sam," struggled to maintain the show amidst technical difficulties and Opie’s continued off-air presence (evident through sounds of writing, burping, and movement).  Sam interacted with Roland, the sound engineer, who was struggling to get the show to commercial breaks.  Crude jokes and references ("Rape you with a rake") occurred.  Sam mentioned needing to play a Joe Rogan clip and an upcoming "Opie and Anthony live" segment. Opie’s eventual departure was marked by the sounds of him putting on his coat, moving a bag, and slamming the door.  Sam mentioned Danny showing their butt in another room. Sam finished the broadcast, filling in for Opie and announcing upcoming programming.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I worked here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits. 
[00:00:30]  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  Don't tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like that.  Good morning. Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, everybody.  Arnold Schwarzenegger likes to fuck pigs.  Yeah, right?  Apparently that's the headline.  What is wrong with him?  She must remind him of somebody.  Whenever you're around somebody that much, there's something about them. 
[00:01:30]  You can find her big nipples sexy.  You can find something sexy on anybody if you're around them enough times.  I guess he likes the big old titties, too.  That is horrid.  She's got big of them.  There's a glamour shot that we're looking at.  Well, I guess not officially a glamour shot, but a picture of her where she thinks she looks good.  Horrid.  And she's maybe a three in that picture.  Maybe a three.  She's got a man's face.  Man's face.  Man's shoulders.  It's horrible.  What is he doing? 
[00:02:00]  Fucking her.  That means Maria Shriver.  I'm sorry.  Terrible.  You want to leave her out of this whole fucking thing because she's hurting today?  He wanted something with a little beef.  No, man.  She's probably horrendous in bed, like Jimmy just said.  Cold as fucking ice.  And you're right, though.  I bet he wanted to look at the fucking meaty, fucking big fat tits.  He wanted somebody he could pound.  Maybe Arnold likes to fuck hard.  Is that Arnold's kid?  He looks just like him.  That's little Arnold.  Oh, God. 
[00:02:30]  Who didn't know that was his kid?  Oh, God.  Of course.  She knew years ago, but she stayed with him, huh?  Oh, that is a fucking scratch-off ticket.  And then Arnie throws her in a cheap house that I guess she's now trying to pay for.  Oh, is that?  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's one of the stories coming out today.  She is horrendous.  She's really, really bad.  Is beauty skin deep or something, or beauty is in the eye of the beholder? 
[00:03:00]  Guaranteed.  Or beauty is what?  He honestly just didn't want to grab that fucking gunny sack full of antlers in bed.  And he needed something with a little bit of meat to it.  Oh, man.  Where?  Where?  And she was available, probably willing.  Wear a bag.  Yeah.  Or she was probably...  Is she a cleaning woman?  What was her official title?  Oh, she was a cleaning woman.  And maybe he wore a bag and she fucking, when she was dusting the next day, grabbed it out  of the trash.  Thank you.  Fucking space-fooded it into her pussy. 
[00:03:30]  That's what I'm getting at.  That's what I'm getting at.  Oh, God.  Because why would he be willy-nilly with his sperm?  Yeah.  That's some fucking valuable sperm right there.  Yeah.  And then there's a picture.  TMZ's all over it.  Happy family.  Our pal at www.tdd.com, right?  Yeah.  He's all over it.  This picture...  How did that stay quiet?  Arnold Schwarzenegger...  I don't know.  That's amazing.  ...is in front of his family Christmas tree with this woman who's holding Arnie's son with 
[00:04:00]  Maria Shriver.  Yeah.  Who was born a mere five days apart from his love child.  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  He, like, fucked and then fucked and...  And the two women had kids five days apart.  Five days apart.  Whoops.  What is he doing?  He's a movie star.  He's the governor of California, and he's banging a two.  I'll say one thing.  She kept her mouth shut, though. 
[00:04:30]  Yes, she did.  She took the pinch.  Wow.  She kept her mouth shut.  She didn't rat.  She is a two, and she kept her mouth shut.  She's a two.  That's very important.  That could clean up and be a three, three and a half, maybe.  You know, if she was like an eight, a nine, or something like that, she'd have yapped,  just like they all do.  Why?  But she's the Perkins waitress out of the whole fucking, you know...  Why does an ugly talk?  She's ugly, man.  I'm sorry.  They're grateful.  Sorry for the women out there, but this broad is ugly, man. 
[00:05:00]  Grateful, thankful.  She knew she had the cash cow right there.  Yeah.  And she didn't shut up.  The hot chicks, they just know when they talk, they're going to get the money from the press  and everything else, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So there you have it.  She kept the gap shut.  Fuck.  Hey, Arnold.  Wow.  But she's got some bigums.  Yeah, yeah.  It's disgusting.  What is Arnold doing as far as his acting career goes?  I hear he's booking a movie.  What's he got? 
[00:05:30]  Some kind of drama?  Operation Dumbo Drop.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, he's trying to get his movie career together.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to do some kind of drama, I think, though.  Going to be typecast.  I think he's past his action hero days, right?  Those big baloney tits on the beach.  Are you kidding me?  He's trying to reboot Terminator.  What?  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  With him as who?  Not the Terminator. 
[00:06:00]  What the fuck are they going to do?  No, you can't have a Terminator like that.  An old one?  No.  You're terminated.  I'm going to terminate you.  It's against the whole thing.  You wouldn't fucking...  Terminators wouldn't get old.  They may make an older one, though, to blend in a certain way.  That's stupid.  Terminators don't get old.  Terminated to blend in.  The rest home.  Wow, I don't know, man.  That's just...  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, I ain't buying it. 
[00:06:30]  Wow, what a slob.  After you drag this shitty topic for two hours, you should tease the weather for Saturday for the next two days.  Oh, what is the weather for Saturday, by the way?  Because I'm going to be at the Pocono Raceway, and it better be nice.  See?  And I'm saying that just to annoy this fucking guy.  Then he writes hacks, and then he writes Joe fucking Rogan laughing my ass off.  Good job making that a bigger letdown than it was.  You're probably one of ten people that are not into the announcement that Joe Rogan is joining this channel. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  Even the haters are having a tough time rallying the troops around this one.  I love...  This is a huge deal and a very good thing for this channel.  I love that.  Nice try, buddy.  Nice try.  I love that his life is so fucked up that he has to listen to something he hates.  Nice try.  Like, that's how miserable this guy is.  He's got to just sit there and go like, well, I hate this, but I've got to sit and listen to it and just be miserable. 
[00:07:30]  Well, fair enough.  Let's maybe ask him this, and he can answer this before he's banned.  All right.  Before he's banned.  I want to know about your radio show, and I want to know about your radio empire, who you're getting together for your network.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or are you just a loser that is jealous of what we do for a living?  I think it's the loser thing.  It's one of the two.  So which one is it?  Are you a loser that is jealous of our success and our radio friends?  Or are you some kind of radio fucking genius yourself, and you've got a hit radio show, and you've got an empire and a bunch of radio guys around you? 
[00:08:00]  So please, please, please answer that question.  Please.  Thank you.  He's an angry, bitter person.  Just an angry, bitter, hates what he's doing with his life person.  And I made the mistake yesterday by saying that this announcement, this Joe Rogan announcement, is pretty much perfect across the board.  And you said you saw one guy.  One guy.  But because we said that, then these idiots had to come out of the woodwork and try to stir shit up. 
[00:08:30]  But guess what?  You're losing on this one.  You're not going to be able to rally the fucking troops on this one, pal.  You're never going to get 100% of the people, so they're always going to be assholes.  Like you said, there could be videos, and it's like you get a dislike.  You see like, and then there's like two dislikes on the fucking flight deck footage of a shuttle launch.  Yeah.  It's like, who wouldn't like that?  And what's your problem with it?  There's always got to be, dude, I like that. 
[00:09:00]  So with the Rogan thing, there's always going to be people that just, boo.  I got a couple guys.  I know exactly who they are, by the way.  They're not fooling anyone.  Every time I put a video up, they dislike it immediately.  To me, that's really fucking creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been putting up videos for two years, and I know exactly who they are.  They quickly dislike it.  They and Jimmy?  That's how, yeah, probably.  We don't like anything that doesn't showcase your cock.  But that's how, to me, that's really creepy. 
[00:09:30]  They obsessively have been doing this for two straight years.  And I know exactly who they are.  They're not fooling anybody.  People do tend to be creepy.  I got creepy, weird, psycho stalkers.  They do tend to be creepy.  And that's all I'm going to say, because I don't want to give it away, because...  Give it away.  Because, unfortunately, they have to be watched very carefully.  Yeah, see everyone else.  Joe Rogan, yay.  You know, it's a great announcement.  So nice try, buddy. 
[00:10:00]  And, of course, you're not going to answer my question.  No, he's done.  Of course.  You're not going to answer, right?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Look, if you're a radio guy, and you think you do a better radio show...  You do an awesome show.  And you're building some kind of radio network.  All right.  I want to see what you think is great.  Yeah.  But, obviously, you're just a fucking loser.  Miserable.  A jealous fucking loser.  Just bask in the fact that he's miserable.  Who probably never even took a shot at anything in his life.  Did nothing.  Most of the haters, that's what they are. 
[00:10:30]  They've never taken a shot at anything in their lives.  Haven't really accomplished anything.  And they're jealous of the people that have, you know, gone for it and became successful.  Haven't really accomplished anything.  Look, I was a scared little fuck when I was growing up.  But guess what?  I took a chance.  You never took a chance.  So now you're going to try to fucking, you know, destroy what we got?  That ain't happening ever.  When I had nothing and no hope or anything, I used to have to write letters to people.  Yeah.  Hey, you're a dick and you suck.  Yeah.  Stamp.  No return address. 
[00:11:00]  Ha ha.  Drive to another town to mail it so it's a different fucking post office stamp.  I'll show you with my anonymity.  Asshole.  So there you have it.  Rogan does join the channel and we're very, very excited.  More info on the way.  And nice try to that guy who doesn't even get credit for anything because I'm not mentioning  your name.  I guess.  And of course you didn't write me back because you're a fucking little pussy.  Little pussy boy.  Fagala.  So what do you think of this Arnold Schwarzenegger thing? 
[00:11:30]  Well.  And then we're going to move into the weather.  Then we'll do the weather for Saturday.  Yep.  Well, like you said, he likes fucking pigs.  What's the attraction there?  Just because she was close to the family?  Yeah.  She's close.  She's available, willing.  Familiarity breeds contempt, they say.  Yeah.  But it can also breed other weird shit.  Like you can become sexually attracted.  He doesn't need to fuck her.  Just to see somebody every day.  It was probably very convenient.  The personality got him.  I'm telling you.  Some of them big giant tits, she would show it. 
[00:12:00]  She did something that just, like where one day he went, oh, fuck her.  Like he probably, he probably couldn't believe the first time he jerked off to her.  I just jerked off to that monster that cleans the toilet.  Happened.  I bet the fact that she was in the house too kept everything quiet because he's not driving  to a hotel.  He's not out where people could see, see him.  She's not driving to the house with people going like, what the fuck is this chick coming  to the house? 
[00:12:30]  She has a reason to be there.  Oh.  So it's probably the easiest fuck with him able to stay out of trouble.  So he sacrifices the looks knowing that he's got a sure thing.  And no one's going to crush it anytime soon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he's got the big old titties he could play with a little bit.  There you go.  Juggle those things around to the hurdy-gurdy.  But not looking up from the titties too much.  You know.  Because that's a brutal face.  I bet he did a lot of fucking from behind where she's on her knees with those giant udders  hanging down to the bed. 
[00:13:00]  And he's just cupping on them.  And he's just like fucking juggling those tits.  Oh.  Fucking her from behind.  Who made the first move?  Yeah.  He probably did.  Probably smacked her on her ass.  You don't think she was like, you know, bending over a little too much to clean the toilet  Maybe she was a little flirtatious.  But from what I've heard about Arnold, the slightest bit of flirtation just makes him  pull his cock out and stuff slapping it on her.  Like he's always been a womanizer.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  You watch some of those early interview videos with female reporters and he's smacking them  on the ass.  He's rubbing their legs.  I would like to kiss you.  Right.  And then this woman gets pregnant.  And what is Maria Shriver thinking?  As she's probably still working for the family.  Probably just thinks.  Did she come up with some imaginary boyfriend?  That she never met or an imaginary husband?  I don't even know if she's married.  She might be travesty and she's married.  She's married.  Oh.  Oh, she was.  Then what happened?  Once that fucking, once an Austrian face popped out of her vagina, her husband's like, 
[00:14:00]  I'm going, I'm leaving you.  Yeah.  He was listed as the father on the birth certificate.  Was he?  Oh.  And he, and she told him that, you know, it's Arnold.  Dude, that was kept quiet?  Yeah.  How did that guy not talk?  I don't know.  Is he an immigrant?  Are they immigrants?  They have family or something?  I don't know.  I know they're not married anymore.  How do you keep that fucking quiet?  Maybe she's an illegal.  Nah.  That would have been out.  Apparently her sister also worked for Arnold.  Oh, I bet she got us.  But dude, people always, dude, if I met Arnold, I would tell everybody, if he dumped a load 
[00:14:30]  in me, I'd be on fucking, I'd be on the shows tomorrow telling people.  Good one, Jim.  I'd be on the shows tomorrow.  The shows.  The shows.  I couldn't think of anything, so I just said something vague.  No, who was on the shows was our pal Ian Halpern talking about this.  Oh, was he?  Yeah, we're trying to get the audio.  Are you kidding me?  He was on Access Hollywood and The Insider and...  Why did they have him?  Because he wrote The Governator.  Oh, yeah.  He's an expert on Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well, I was saying this a while ago to Jim Norton.  Jim Norton. 
[00:15:00]  Norton.  I love Norton.  Let's say hi to Hugh in Nashville.  Hugh.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  What's up, Hugh?  Hey, love you, love you.  Light blue.  Yes, Hugh.  I haven't seen a picture of this broad, but it could be that he was a fitness guy all  his life, and maybe she's fat.  He's probably got this weird thing inside that maybe he's secretly, I don't know, he likes  that sort of thing.  I don't know.  Likes out-of-shape women?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  As kind of a goof?  You're kind of attracted to the opposite of what you are.  I don't know.  No, but I think she must have reminded him of somebody, or maybe just being around the  house.  Some people are just sexy, man.  Some people have a sexy vibe to them, and they have your number sexually.  Maybe she's just one of those people that has his number and knows how to fucking turn  him on and fucked his brains out.  Yeah.  So weird.  It's just a weird situation.  Bye.  Maybe she spanks him.  Maybe he's a big fucking sub, and every chick fucking does whatever he wants, and maybe  this one was like, you're a bad boy. 
[00:16:00]  You're going to be spanked.  That's probably how it started.  Fucking a year before they, you know, pick up your socks, and she gave him a little swat  in the butt, like a little mind.  He was like, oh, his mother used to do that.  An adult baby, maybe.  Yeah.  How did this all come out, by the way?  He told her, Maria Shriver, like a while ago.  But why would he tell 10 years later?  She must have had her suspicions, and finally he came clean with it, right?  There were some news sources that were really close to breaking it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he wanted to beat him all to the punch.  Get ahead of the story.  Mmm.  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  But how did the news sources get involved?  I don't know.  Yeah, they're always looking for something.  Maybe because the kids started getting older and looking exactly like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  She has divorce papers when she divorced her husband, and it's listed on the divorce papers  that they have no children together.  Oh.  So obviously there's a child somewhere.  And it started, like, I think they started poking their schnozzes in there when they  saw that neither of them were wearing wedding rings anymore.  Mm-hmm.  So they probably were wondering, oh, what's going on with Arnold and Maria Shriver?  And then they say, all right, let's look a little deeper. 
[00:17:00]  We find the maid, and she doesn't have any kids, but she's got a kid, and it looks just  like Arnold.  Oh, boy.  You're getting a request.  You don't have to do it, obviously.  Yeah.  Uh, they're begging you to do Arnie waking up in the morning.  Uh, oh, oh, with that, he doesn't seem to really give a shit.  You don't think he gives a shit?  No, he doesn't care.  He don't care.  But he's not going to now marry this girl, right?  No.  He's going to be paying the child support, but that's about it. 
[00:17:30]  If you squint, you could see that pixelated, and you could kind of see right through it.  What, of the kid?  Yeah, or whoever he's in a picture with.  The picture of the kid is out there.  Yeah, why is he protected?  It's just a kid's face.  It's not like he's...  Well, the papers will not show the kid.  Well, uh, the websites will.  Yeah, of course the websites have been.  You want, Arnold, what do you want?  The impression of him getting up in the morning?  I'll do it.  Start terminating.  That's probably exactly right there, Chip. 
[00:18:00]  To a T.  Kid looks retarded there.  Looks a little retarded.  Yeah, he doesn't look bright.  She's showing him off like she just scraped foil off of his face with a quarter.  Ooh, winner.  It looks just like fucking young Arnold.  Oh, absolutely.  It's Arnold smoking a doobie.  Fontaine, come on, brother. 
[00:18:30]  This has potential.  Go ahead, sir.  Hey, Fontaine.  Fontaine.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jim.  You know, he didn't fuck her yesterday, so the kid's 10.  If you take off 11 years, she might have been a five.  She kind of looks like fucking Rocky Dennis.  Yeah, she looks like fucking Rhea Perlman, but like a lot fatter.  A monster version of Rhea Perlman.  She's actually worse looking when she was younger.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Jimbo.  Yes, Fontaine.  He fought that girl, and I think the kids were born five days apart, right?  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  I think so, yeah.  He had his good boy come and his naughty boy come.  Oh.  Here.  I can't do Arnold.  I have a big good boy load and a naughty boy load.  A good boy load and a naughty boy load.  It always turns into Jamaican.  It's Jamaican Arnold.  Good boy.  A boy.  By the way, I love the fact that people are tweeting that they can't get that out of their  head.  I'm so happy.  Oh.  He was whistling it or humming it just like right before the show started. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  By the way, hold on.  A secret text I received last night.  It's from a very lovely unnamed woman at 827.  Greg won't.  This is Opie's wife texting me.  Oh.  Greg won't stop singing.  And she puts in quotes, naughty boy phone with dance moves.  Oh, there's dance moves.  I hope the original is better than his version.  Oh, and I hate you for this. 
[00:20:00]  Around the house at 830.  She just wanted to relax.  He's dancing naughty boy phone.  We were walking around the neighborhood as a family.  Because I learned yesterday you have to do the dip as well.  So I was doing the dip and walking at the same time.  See, I don't hate all your characters, Jimmy.  I only hate one of your characters.  You don't hate me.  No, I don't mind Uncle Paul.  Oh, I know you don't.  I like Uncle Paul.  Sure you do.  Who doesn't?  But I was sort of doing the Jamaican version.  Oh, the Jamaican version is amongst my favorite versions. 
[00:20:30]  And people want it on video today.  It's been covered many times.  Sometime today, we're going to have to do that.  Fucking trying to wake up, man.  I'm tired.  You're tired too?  Yeah.  I have, speaking of phones, I have an update on, remember the girl that was leaving messages  and fucking text messages and everything on my phone?  Yes.  I have, since I put it out on Twitter to call and tell her to stop, they have completely 
[00:21:00]  stopped.  They've completely stopped.  But I got a tweet from somebody that said, dude, my friend will not stop getting messages  from this chick.  That means he fucked her.  That means he fucked her.  Either that, or he probably started off with like, oh, the fucking Anthony guy, what an  asshole.  And like, you seem pretty cool and everything. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, shit.  And then she just like, meh, meh, meh, latch on.  And this guy's friend now fucking tweeted me, was like, dude, this chick won't fucking  stop.  And I'm just like, all right.  It's like the ring.  It's like the ring.  You got to fucking pass it on to somebody else.  Oh, shit.  Classic.  So that means he went in for a taste or something.  Maybe.  Maybe something like that.  I don't profess to know.  It's kind of like Back to the Future, like where you have to get Lorraine and George  to kiss or else the future won't happen. 
[00:22:00]  And you're Marty trying to get them together.  Trying to put them together.  So your world could be at peace.  My world's at peace.  My picture comes back.  And that's it.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  So I was laughing when I read that because I know what that guy is going through now.  He's in hell?  Yeah, that one's done.  Oh, right, right, right.  A lot of phone calls, but no one to go to there.  Not a go-to call? 
[00:22:30]  Nah.  I told you the story of the stalker I had when I was at BAB, right?  I wish my cousin was awake so I could call him because he was all in on this.  I don't know if you remember.  There was kind of a chubby girl that was obsessed with me.  And I used to do a lot of running back then.  And then my fucking knees couldn't keep up with the running.  That's why I moved on to the inline skating.  Oh.  And I haven't inline skated in probably two years, by the way,  for anyone keeping track.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Now I bike.  You do it every day according to people. 
[00:23:00]  According to the people.  You know, there's a delay.  And I used to have this running route when I was living with my parents  when I first moved home from Buffalo.  As an older fucking guy, by the way, I'm living with my parents again.  And she would stalk me at BAB.  She'd wait in the parking lot.  She then started to be somewhere on my running route.  Like, hey, oh, what's up?  I didn't, you know, make him believe we just bumped into each other.  Just happened to be there? 
[00:23:30]  And then remember the stupid birthday party they put together as a bar gig?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you go to that?  I think I was at that one.  Do you remember she showed up with the birthday presents?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that was a while ago.  And I was freaked out.  It was a whole pile of birthday gifts for me.  Yeah.  The station put together, they thought it would be a great idea  that I have a birthday with the listeners.  But no other listener brought birthday gifts.  It was a hacky bit.  Yeah.  They brought out a birthday cake.  It was just an opportunity to drink with people and for the station to make money. 
[00:24:00]  So she shows up with all the birthday gifts, and I'm ignoring her.  God, I wish my cousin was here.  Because to this day, we tell this story at family fucking parties.  She started stomping the floor behind me because I was ignoring her.  She was angry.  Angry that I wasn't opening up her gifts.  I was paying attention to her.  And I never opened up her gifts.  And she continued to stalk me and continued to be on my running route,  just trying to get my attention.  And just like you, one day it fucking ended.  It just stops.  One day it ended, and I got a phone call at BAB that this girl was in a horrific car accident. 
[00:24:30]  Whoa.  And that was the only reason it stopped.  Wow.  It's the only reason it stopped.  Was she dead?  No, but she was pretty fucked up.  Wow.  Possibly paralyzed.  Oof.  Yeah.  And now I don't wish that shit on anyone.  Oh, I do.  And she kind of crossed the line, but not enough to wish that upon someone. 
[00:25:00]  But that's how it ended for this particular person.  Yee.  And then she left me alone.  Yeah, well, that's one way for them to leave you alone, I guess.  And I bring that up today because I'm wondering now why, you know, your stalker, cold turkey like that.  Somebody found someone else.  That's the M.O. on this one.  Yeah.  You find someone else and you move along.  And that's it.  You move along.  So Ian Halpern, His Highness, was all over the news yesterday.  ABC.  Oh, fuck.  He was on ABC.  He must have just been beside himself. 
[00:25:30]  Like, what a stroke of luck.  He puts out the Governator book.  Right.  Which, you know, look, didn't really fly off the shelves.  And then he's the go-to guy.  Mm-hmm.  For these entertainment shows.  Let's see if we get a different Ian Halpern.  I doubt it.  Because he's on ABC.  Here we go.  Fourteen years ago, the mother of the illegitimate child was reportedly working pregnant at the Schwarzenegger-Schriver home. 
[00:26:00]  At the same time, Maria was also pregnant with her fourth child.  I know for a fact she's heard the rumors about the child out of wedlock before.  And they've tried different things to patch it up.  But nothing has worked.  Wow.  He's very normal.  To patch it up.  And now they're saying she was pregnant 14 years ago?  How old is this kid?  I was 14.  Fourteen.  I thought it was 10 years ago.  No, I was 14.  Holy shit.  But you know, if you feel bad for Maria Shriver, she remembers, I guarantee you, her and this woman had heart-to-hearts about their kids. 
[00:26:30]  You think?  We both had babies five days apart.  She worked for it for fucking 20 years.  Maria Shriver probably kept it.  How was your baby?  Oh, they talked about it.  She talked to Arnold about it.  She has memories every step of the fucking way with this.  Oh, how humiliating.  And they were pregnant at the same time.  So some of those gifts Maria Shriver got that she didn't need because she's really rich.  She probably said, here, why don't you have this?  So sharing, like, baby shower gifts and stuff.  Brutal for Maria. 
[00:27:00]  I think she knew.  I think Maria Shriver knew.  I don't know if she saw the kids.  Just another dopey bra that stays in it for whatever reason.  What, the power?  Just knowing him.  Having a power couple was good for her as well?  Just knowing him over the years, for that many years, and knowing the type of person he is.  She probably knew he was fucking around.  You can't keep that shit a secret. 
[00:27:30]  Yesterday about it said that there was a portion of time where women were showing up at his private offices.  Ah, there you go.  In wherever his office is in Hollywood or whatever.  And women would come in, you know, looking as if they had some kind of business to conduct.  Well, they certainly did.  Manila envelopes or whatnot.  Yes.  So I'm sure he was banging broads in his office.  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there are probably other little Arnold children running about, scurrying about. 
[00:28:00]  Maybe we'll find a few more in the news before Saturday when, you know, the world ends or something.  Oh, shit.  I forgot about that.  The world's supposed to end.  Two days to go.  I have it completely penciled in on the calendar.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you at least throwing a party?  It's like Friday, you know, work and then trainer, workout.  Right.  Saturday, Poconos.  Nice. 
[00:28:30]  End of world.  Well, Saturday is end of world.  End of, that's what I mean.  So how cool is that?  You're driving around really fast as the world's ending.  That would be cool.  I would have a fast car, which would be good.  I've got to remember to put a go bag in my trunk.  This is an odd thing.  This is a very odd thing that happened last night also.  So, I guess about 8 o'clock last night, I'm just, I'm not going to use any names or anything, 
[00:29:00]  but I'll just say a friend dropped by.  A friend dropped by.  Jack Daniels?  Yeah, well, that's a resident.  That's a friend that lives at my house.  You put your dick in the bottle like he did with the maid?  Sorry.  Him and Captain Morgan hanging out in the basement.  Little mustaches.  A friend drops by that I will only describe as somebody that works in a federal capacity.  In a federal capacity. 
[00:29:30]  Gotcha.  It kind of knows some things.  And came over and as a gift, goes, you know what?  Here, I got a couple of things for your go bag.  And gave me two kind of gas mask things.  I was like, here, there you go, for the go bag.  Uh-huh.  And I'm just like, oh, thanks.  You know, I didn't think about it until, you know, the friend left. 
[00:30:00]  And then I'm just kind of like talking to my chick going like,  isn't that a little odd that kind of brings that over and Saturday is supposed to be the end of the world?  Oh, now you're creeping me out.  And it's like, this guy's kind of, you know.  He's in the know?  He's a little more, let's just say he's more in the know than we are.  Right.  With certain things.  Right.  That's all I'll say.  So I'm just kind of like, hmm, interesting.  That's all.  Just thought it was weird timing.  That's creepy.  Out of nowhere, too.  Almost like he knows something and he's trying to take care of his pal.  Yeah, yeah, something like that. 
[00:30:30]  That's what I was thinking.  Kind of like, hmm, that's interesting timing.  That's all.  I'm not walking around Saturday.  Pop that in my go bag and, you know, I'm ready to go.  That's going in the trunk Saturday.  I'm going to keep that around for a few days, you know, just because you never know.  You never know.  Never know.  Were you guys invited to post-rapture looting on Facebook?  Oh, really?  Is that going on?  Yeah.  Post-rapture looting.  Travis and I are attending.  You're attending?  Yeah, I think I still need to RSVP. 
[00:31:00]  I hope it's Saturday night.  Yeah, I know.  I had some plans going on.  It's funny, because I had some people, and they wanted to know what I was doing, and  I was telling them, it's like, well, it all depends on this rapture thing.  Yeah.  And I was like, if people are still being judged by the time I get back, you know, I'll try  to check it out.  Yeah, you know, if judgment is going to take all day, if it's alphabetical, it's going  to be a while.  Yeah, I guess.  I mean, everybody can't go at once.  Although I'm kind of screwed with C.  You are at the end of the line.  Yeah, you're cool.  I mean, I might be able to check some of this out before it's my turn.  Do you think the Lord is going to do it alphabetically? 
[00:31:30]  Like those commercials?  Well, if your last name begins with A through R, you're going up to heaven or down to hell.  Call now.  If your last name starts with R to Z, you can start calling tomorrow.  Yeah, I'm kind of fucked.  Let me think.  You in the middle.  Jim Norton.  I'm really kind of screwed.  I'm going to be the first one if they go alphabetically.  Maybe they won't.  Hope not.  Well, I think it's going by the time zone.  Oh, time zone. 
[00:32:00]  I think we get some extra life.  So England and that ship by the prime meridian.  Yeah, by the time that it comes around to us.  Kind of like New Year's Eve.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Watch other parts of the world then before it gets to you.  We can watch Armageddon on TV before it comes here.  Who gets it first?  Like Japan or something?  Love it.  Yeah.  It'll be like Australia, I think, right?  Yeah.  Because it's yesterday or something.  Yeah, somewhere.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  And which 21st is it?  Because it'll be the 21st in like another country before it'll be the 21st here. 
[00:32:30]  I think that question has been posed.  And what do they say?  I think there's...  I got to look it up, but I think they do have an answer for it.  Of course they do.  Of course they do.  They have an answer, except for that guy that Obi tried to interview.  Yeah, thank you.  Of course.  Except for the guy I talked to.  He was too scared to talk on video.  I watched that.  Which is the stupidest fucking thing ever, if you think about it.  I was so fucking annoyed watching that.  Like, why is this fucking douchebag is holding court with... 
[00:33:00]  And you didn't tell me that fucking video contained a bunch of teens.  Everyone pointed at it like...  I guarantee Anthony will watch this video of yours.  I'm like, okay.  I've seen these eight assholes.  The one was quite the looker, by the way.  The one on the left.  Whatever, dude.  Right after the guy bolted.  Fucking...  You didn't say it was teen, Opie's eye.  That I'm fucking tuning into.  You're all in.  With the nice camera and everything now.  Fucking, we're able to see the teen Opie's eye. 
[00:33:30]  You saw the youth.  Yes, it was great.  And he was holding court with these fucking youngsters.  With his dumb paperwork and his dumb fucking beliefs.  And then you come up to him with a camera.  And now he wants to fucking clam up.  You pussy cock sucker.  Fuck him.  And then he starts running away.  And then he's using a black woman as a shield.  Yeah.  So you couldn't get an angle on him.  Fuck him.  But think about that.  He's out there trying to get the word out that the world is ending. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Now, I'm sort of the media, I guess.  You'll get the word out.  It'll get out there.  It's anything.  He would probably want it on anybody's video.  That's what I said, sort of.  Because I didn't announce that from the radio show or anything.  Yeah.  But still, I got a camera.  So why wouldn't you want to tell someone with a camera that might show it around to help spread the word?  No, no.  If he's trying to spread the word talking to people on the street, the next step is, you know. 
[00:34:30]  And I wasn't even harassing him.  I went right up to him to ask him.  It was in the middle of him pontificating in the middle of the fucking sidewalk.  Right.  So you would think you would want to spread the word like that, but no, fucking pussy faggot.  Did you see Burt Reynolds in that video?  Really?  Yeah, I caught Burt.  Who gives a turkey?  I caught Burt Reynolds leaving the subway.  Turd Ferguson.  Burt Reynolds is alive and well.  Is he?  And hanging out with a frump.  And he left the subway.  Oh, you kidding? 
[00:35:00]  It was really him?  Yeah, in the back of the video, I saw Burt Reynolds.  Was it a Dawn of the Dead type Burt Reynolds?  Where they were shooting their heads off?  It looked like a healthy Burt Reynolds.  Yeah.  Yeah, he looks like he's, you know, a little younger than we've seen him lately.  Yeah.  More His Highness on the news.  Oh, yeah.  He was the big get yesterday.  The big get.  Because he knows all about Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Ian Halperin, everyone.  Sure he does.  Schwarzenegger biographer Ian Halperin says he's not surprised by the news and says even more 
[00:35:30]  shocking details of Schwarzenegger's private life may soon come out.  I learned that he possibly had kids with up to six women and so it was not...  Why doesn't this fuck ever tell us this stuff?  Up to kids with...  Maybe he did.  We just weren't listening.  Yeah, he might have said that.  Maybe we were calling him a fucking asshole while he was telling us all this news.  He's been doing our show off and on for well over a year now, maybe two years.  And he has never answered a fucking question.  Because he probably just came up with this before he sat down to do this interview. 
[00:36:00]  It's like, well, maybe six kids.  Look, it's fun to beat him up for two straight hours.  But how about you give us something, Ian?  How about you give us this scoop?  I think he did say that there was a problem, right?  Dude, he was on the air on Monday, I guess.  Yeah.  He could have been doing this.  But what did he do?  Didn't he tell us when the book came out and we had him on the show that there was  a problem between the two and that they wouldn't be together?  Yeah, it was vague, though.  It was vague.  Do you think he knew, though, at that point? 
[00:36:30]  Come on.  If he knew, he would have said something.  You know this motherfucker.  He loves the publicity.  We asked him on Monday, why wasn't this in his book?  And he was scared of lawsuits.  If he could have broke this fucking huge story, he'd have done it.  His book was sold like fucking hotcakes.  Like the proverbial hotcake.  That's right.  Yeah.  But then on Monday, my problem is Monday.  Now the whole story is exploding everywhere.  We have him on the show.  Yeah.  We do ask him why it wasn't in his book.  He says he was worried about lawsuits.  But then he could have gave us this clip that we're listening to now. 
[00:37:00]  That there's more kids.  He could have gave this to us Monday.  Mm.  Mm.  Enough, Ian.  You've got to answer something and give us something.  Yeah, that's true.  Some kind of scoop.  Ian rules of having the information after the fact.  Right.  Ex post facto.  And so it was not a shock when I learned of this one child out of Wetlock in Bakersfield.  Halpern says while working on a biography of the former governor just last year, he interviewed  the women and believes each story. 
[00:37:30]  Their stories were compelling.  And, of course, none of them would describe Arnold as a serial monogamous.  They described him more as a guy who was like back to his old trademark pickup line days back  in the 60s.  What are those trademark pickup lines?  I don't know.  Fuck me.  Hey, good looking.  What's cooking?  It probably was.  He's watching.  Corny.  Oh, God.  Dr. Steve.  Shit. 
[00:38:00]  I'm going to have to spend the rapture with you assholes.  Oh, isn't he coming in today?  Yeah.  Is it today?  Are you flying in today?  But he's going to be here for the weekend.  Yeah.  Wow.  He'll be on the show tomorrow live.  Again, see, if it's Saturday night, then we can hang out because, you know, I'd like  to have the guy.  I was going to invite Dr. Steve over the house.  That's nice.  And, you know, crack open a nice bottle of his wine for him to drink and I'll have some  good stuff.  You drink it. 
[00:38:30]  The only reason his wine is still in my fucking house is because he made those nice labels.  Yeah, he did make some nice labels.  You walk into my wine cellar and it's very bare right now.  I'm having it refilled after the big wine tasting, of course, that's set up.  And there's only two bottles of wine in there and it's both Dr. Steve's sitting there all  alone in the cedar racks.  But he makes these nice labels, so of course you can't throw it away.  Yeah, it looks great.  I can't open it. 
[00:39:00]  Fuck.  Collector's item.  Of course.  A dust collector's item.  I get it because I don't open them.  By the way, because people...  Horrible fucking swill.  Oh, this is wine?  Yes.  Yaw, yaw.  I drain the tubes.  I take the tubes, the little cups that you urinate into in the office and I scrape the  urine flakes.  And you do that and you mix with saliva, kind of the way a native will make a beverage.  And then you let that ferment in rhino cum. 
[00:39:30]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  And then you crush it under your feet.  Very good, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  You put little mustache hairs in it.  That's good.  I can't wait to see Dr. Steve.  It's always a pleasure to have him on the show.  Sure, isn't it?  Sure is.  Yes, it is.  He's a good egg.  One more clip from Ian Halperin.  Wow.  Fucking...  Making the rounds yesterday.  Go-to guy, Ian Halperin.  Giving everybody else some stuff, but not us.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Because he's saying that there could be up to six kids.  Oh, look at Fox inside the mind of a cheater.  And they showed Arnold.  So I guess they're doing an exclusive.  Well, when Arnold dies, he's going to have to give his brain to science.  Really?  Yeah, to see why a guy like that would fuck pigs.  Yeah, well, I don't think you really got to...  A lot of guys do.  A lot of guys do.  Yeah, but you know what?  Seahorses.  He was kind of smart, though. 
[00:40:30]  Seahorses, sea pigs, whatever.  Maybe he was fucking her because he knew that she would keep her fucking mouth shut.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's going to keep her fucking mouth shut.  It wasn't exactly the highest quality, but...  You've got to trade off.  There's a trade off factor.  That's a big trade off, too.  I was saying before, there's the Perkins waitress who shut the fuck up the whole time.  And then there's the fucking hot stripper shit that was yapping and yapping about fucking Tiger.  But that's a new thing.  Let's not forget.  Yeah.  Oh, you're talking 14 years ago. 
[00:41:00]  The hot women used to fucking keep their mouth shut.  I know.  They used to.  This whole thing changed only recently.  What decisions Arnold had to make every night?  Do I fuck Jabba the Hutt or Tommy Shaw for his sticks?  Here's Ian Halpern with another exclusive.  Of course.  The former California governor and Hollywood actor fathered a child with her, a boy, 14 years ago.  He always had, like Tiger Woods, an addiction to sex, an addiction to women. 
[00:41:30]  And that was his biggest downfall.  Shit.  We could be saying that on these shows.  But he's Ian Halpern, the author of The Governator.  Right.  Number 632,836 on the Amazon.  It'll move up a couple places.  Yeah.  Probably go up a couple of ticks.  He's fucking Ian's drooling at this shit.  He's drooling.  Of course he is.  I could afford so many more fucking call girls as my goddesses. 
[00:42:00]  Maybe get some hotter ones next time.  Yeah.  Get some hotter ones.  Get some that are a little paler, if you know what I mean.  You take the black away.  I'm talking for you.  That one on the road was not bad at all.  I didn't mind the one.  The light skin black was not bad at all.  Yeah.  The other one.  She was a little ghetto.  A little too ghetto for me.  Should we get Ian on the phone just to say, what the fuck?  No.  Why are you doing this?  No.  You could have gave us some info?  I am fucking speaking for the listeners today. 
[00:42:30]  No.  No.  A big no.  We heard what he said on the recordings we just played.  All right.  Oh, because he'll just start going off on something else.  You know.  Let's play it out.  Let's play it out.  What would you ask Ian?  Ian, why?  Let me just tell you.  Anthony, Nicolini, let's fight for the boxing.  All right.  I love it.  Great.  Opie, where's Norton?  Is Norton there?  Norton. 
[00:43:00]  Well, I said that Arnold fathered children.  I've said this for years.  But you didn't say it on us.  I did say it on your program.  But you weren't listening.  The two is his highness.  Why isn't it?  I'm from Canada.  He's fucking just rambling.  He just started rambling.  Not for him.  I guess you're right.  You know, until next time we get him on and beat the shit out of him.  It's hilarious.  Sure, sure, sure. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  We should take a little break.  Oh, yes.  Oh, wait.  His Highness is on Inside Edition, too.  Oh, Inside Edition.  Hold on.  Wow.  There's one more Ian Halpern clip.  Ringing off the hook.  There's a big day for him.  And he announced on his Twitter that he was going to be making the rounds.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  I don't follow him.  I should.  I guess I should.  Incredibly, Maria gave birth just five days earlier to her youngest child, Christopher.  In the coming days, you're going to see divorce papers served.  Ian Halpern wrote the best-selling biography, The Governator, and has a documentary. 
[00:44:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  The best-selling biography?  Hold the phone.  A best-seller?  That one didn't do as well as his other books.  Wait a minute.  We were goofing on it the entire time.  How could they call it a best-seller?  Right.  Did he say, make sure you say best-seller?  Yes, I'm sure.  He's a hype man.  What's up?  I guess people are buying The Governator.  Really?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, because while it is in stock, there is a notice on Amazon here that says, only four 
[00:44:30]  left.  Order soon.  Just last week, there were five.  Yeah, exactly.  About the author.  Yeah, it's moving up.  I remember last time I checked the best-sellers ranking, it was in the hundreds of thousands.  Yeah.  But today, it's 61,056.  And how can they say best-seller?  Best-sellers.  Best-sellers.  I don't...  Documentary on Charlie Sheen, airing on TV Guide Friday.  You believe this is just the tip of the iceberg? 
[00:45:00]  We've heard about one woman, one child.  Let me tell you right now, exclusively to Inside Edition, you're going to see a plethora of other  women come out of the woodwork, because during my investigation, I interviewed at least six  women who claimed they had children with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  You piece of shit.  See, he could have told that one.  Ian, you're a piece of shit.  He could have said that one.  You're dead, Toss!  On our very program.  Exclusively to Inside Edition.  He actually gets on a show and talks and gives information and then shuts up and allows 
[00:45:30]  the other host to talk.  It's amazing.  Get the word to Ian.  He's dead, Toss.  What, Ian, do we get on this show?  We get shit.  We get shit, Ian.  Because we get to farm that shit out.  Of course.  And he was on our show Monday.  Yeah.  Two days later, he gives that to people that pay attention.  Yeah.  We get information about him fucking taking pictures with Elmo in fucking Times Square.  That was our exclusive Monday.  That's our exclusive.  Thank you, Ian. 
[00:46:00]  Thanks a lot for that.  We take care of you.  You don't take care of us.  I've never seen so many happy people after your comment of Ian's dead talk.  I've never seen the word yay written so many times.  You know, at this point, Ian, more hated than Bobo.  Yes.  Ian, you're done.  You're done.  I have an exclusive on my dick.  Bobo told me yesterday that his favorite nickname for his penis is The Stub. 
[00:46:30]  That's his favorite?  A little trivia for you.  Good to know.  Is he doing the physical fitness thing?  Oh, he's really excited.  Yeah.  He's very confident that he's going to blow away the competition.  Here comes the pre.  He's very excited.  And what about our own E-Rock?  Has he finally come around?  No.  Why not?  Not doing it.  Not doing it.  And what is the reason behind that?  Good question.  We need a reason. 
[00:47:00]  I was not asked or involved or in anything to do with this.  But you're being asked now.  No.  I was told that, hey, this is what you're doing at the beginning of the week.  And I said no.  Oh, so somebody that is your superior at work told you that you're doing something and you said no.  Oh, I get it.  Exactly.  Is that how it works in the workplace?  You could just tell the people that are above you in the pecking order that you're not doing something that entails your job?  Well, when there was meetings and other people involved saying, oh, yeah, we'll have him do this and then sell it and not even ask me or tell me that I'm participating until, hey, this is happening Friday. 
[00:47:30]  This is what you're doing.  Well, what about now if you were asked, Iraq, could you do this for the show?  Could I?  Yes.  Will I?  No.  Now, we all know you'll be doing it next Friday.  Of course he will.  Stop with this shit.  Of course you will.  Of course you will.  No. 
[00:48:00]  He'll be doing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll let you play it out this way for a while.  It's fun.  It's fun and all, but.  I like when he makes like he's got balls.  Yeah, it's kind of cute.  But next Friday he'll be on that floor doing fucking sit-ups.  With fucking Bobo right next to him.  That's right.  Come on.  Come on, Eric.  We have to win.  Who do we have?  We have Iraq, Bobo.  Yep.  Who else is going to be partaking in the physical fitness challenge? 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  Danny, do we know?  I know very little about this.  Yeah.  Where's Travis?  This event competition thing.  Because we got to get all the info out again.  Yeah.  Because it's for the Pocono 500 race events of June 10th through the 12th.  Yeah.  And $1,000 cash.  You get to sit in the skybox.  That's really cool.  Nice.  In 500 words or less, tell us why you are NASCAR's biggest fan and why you deserve these tickets.  Three finalists will listen in as Bobo, says it right there, E-Rock, E-Rock, and Roland 
[00:49:00]  do battle in the O&A Physical Fitness Challenge next week.  Roland's another one who's flat out refusing to participate.  How does this happen?  Then we don't have a contest.  Roland says he'll participate if he can get 10 guest favors.  How about he's had 25?  Yes.  Guest favors.  I'll list his previous guest favors.  And believe me, he could come in and say that they worked out and we didn't think they  were going to work out and they worked out and stuff, but that's just because of our  amazing talents. 
[00:49:30]  That's an old list.  Roland's not doing it.  Roland's not doing it.  No, we have somebody else.  Why is he doing it?  Because we change our minds.  Troy Kwan?  Why would we change our mind?  Roland's perfect for this.  Stalker Patty.  Oh, God.  What is she doing?  We haven't had her on in a while, though.  That's for sure.  Who can you use both?  Oh, my God.  It's three.  That's the rules.  And E-Rock's definitely doing it?  I would hope so.  I think Eric's going to kick ass.  Yeah.  I am.  I want Eric to kick Bobo's ass. 
[00:50:00]  Roland, why aren't you doing this?  I know you pay attention to the meetings.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know he paid his phone.  I was sleeping a long time.  What happened?  Was I lying, Roland?  Are you going to participate?  No.  All right.  There you go.  What happened?  He said.  What?  I said I don't want to be weighed.  I said I want to be weighed on live air.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  We got the other Roland today. 
[00:50:30]  Look at me.  Look at me.  Oh, shit.  I'm not fucking with him.  I'm just like, okay.  We got the other Roland today, man.  This is the other Roland.  Look at his eyes.  Right now.  That's why I'm just saying, all right, you don't want to participate?  You know that fun.  I'm fine with it.  You know the fun-loving tickle of shit?  Gone.  That's not this guy today.  Did not come into this studio.  No, it didn't.  I just fucking raped him.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Wow.  Why are you so pissed?  Look at his eyes, dude.  Look at his eyes, dude.  I can't even look at him.  He's like scary to look at.  Why are you pissed? 
[00:51:00]  What's going on?  No, I just said I don't want to be weighed on live air.  If you want me to participate, I'll participate, but I won't be weighed on live air.  No.  Okay.  That's fair.  Why is there supposed to be a weighing?  Well, that's what Schmuck here said to Dr. Ian.  Ooh.  I mean, yeah, that's what Dr. Steve said.  I'm not saying he's lying.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  Yeah, see his backpedaling.  He's scared.  Ooh.  Come on, little man.  Wow.  Speak, little man.  Speak.  Ooh.  What happened?  What happened? 
[00:51:30]  Oh, I don't know.  I'm just letting Roland talk.  Roland is fucking angry today.  When he said speak, little man, speak, how amazing would it be if Rich Voss just materialized  on the top of the console?  Oh, shit.  Well, Travis, what's the controversy?  Yeah, little man.  I have no idea what the controversy is.  It's just called a weigh-in.  That's why Dr. Steve is coming.  It's not an actual weigh-in.  Well, according to him, he said there is a weigh-in.  Well, Dr. Steve's wrong.  What happened after we left here yesterday? 
[00:52:00]  I have no idea.  Was there a meeting?  No, he called the office.  I picked up the phone.  He goes, oh, so we're going to be weighed in so we can make fun of your body fat and your  weight.  I'm like, oh, a surprise.  That was ruined from schmuckos who wanted to make fun of me.  So they go, fuck themselves, because I'll fuck them in their mouth.  You realize that this whole competition, by participating in it, is being made fun of?  Because the whole point of this competition is to get overweight people to do things that  they aren't.  I know, you make fun of how you run and how you do exercise, but not the weight. 
[00:52:30]  Wait, so I think I got what's going on here.  Dr. Steve blew a, supposedly.  No.  Yeah, because he had jokes written.  Supposedly blew a surprise.  Yeah, the joke's written down already.  Like, oh, you can do tempo jumps?  Who?  But Dr. Steve, but it's fine.  The joke is fine.  Dr. Steve called you to tell you that you're going to be weighed.  Yes.  And you didn't know that.  Yes.  And you thought that was being kept from you.  Yes.  I see what's going on here.  Is that true, Travis?  No.  Here.  Originally, we were supposed to do that.  Gary Jr. here. 
[00:53:00]  Gary Jr.  Oh.  Gary Jr.  Oh.  Yeah, backpedal.  No, it's Carleese Jr.  Oh.  Well, according to the rules, we did not realize that.  Just say, you said, told him.  Because that's what you said.  You told him.  Say, Travis told me this.  He's on a tear.  Well, Roland feels like he wasn't told something.  Yeah.  But Travis has his side of the story, too.  And I know Dr. Steve is up, so he better get his ass on the phone.  I know.  Dr. Steve's been texting.  Get him on the fucking phone.  I will participate.  I will do the exercise.  But you're mad at who? 
[00:53:30]  Because they were keeping info from you.  I'm not mad at him, but I'm just saying whoever said it.  I'm not keeping anything.  Dr. Steve was supposed to come in on Friday to do the prostate exam thing.  That's being pushed back.  So Dr. Steve already had his flights booked.  So we said, okay, well, what can we do with Dr. Steve?  And we said, okay, well, we're doing the physical fitness challenge next weekend or next week.  So let's kind of do like a kind of like weigh-in type thing where not with actual weights being weighed,  but just that type of like, let's get the contestants and just get them ready for next week. 
[00:54:00]  Dr. Steve was told this, not by me, by Rob Cross, and he took the ball and ran.  Well, fuck him and his fucking ball hit, too.  Dr. Steve now saying, now I'm not doing it.  Oh, boy.  This thing's coming apart at the scene.  Wait, hey, let's see.  Hold on, hold on.  Dr. Steve is boarding a plane, so this has got to be quick.  He's boarding a plane?  What, is he talking to it?  I'm boarding.  Sorry, I should just run with it.  Dr. Steve, what's up, buddy? 
[00:54:30]  Hey, guys.  Hi, y'all.  It's on a plane.  They're going to make me turn my phone off in a second.  All right, Roland is livid because he thinks he's being weighed tomorrow.  Is that true?  Well, I mean, part of the way it was told to me was that we were going to get some of  our more portly members of the staff and do a physical fitness challenge on them and  then make, you know, make fun of them.  And one of the... 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, why don't you get Rob Cross and make fun of his little skiddle, if I could ask.  Oh, shit.  Wow, Roland is fucking loving it.  Is Roland mad at me?  No, no, no.  Not you.  Not you.  I think he loves you because you blew the surprise.  Because Roland had no idea that he was going to...  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  I don't know what's real right now.  But Roland is happy with you because you fucking blew the surprise that Roland was going to  be weighed in front of everybody yesterday. 
[00:55:30]  Lucky for Arnold, fucking Dr. Steve didn't deliver that fucking, that fucking, that baby  out of wedlock.  Everybody would have known about it 14 years ago.  I, ah, delivered an illegitimate governator.  I don't know how the surprise got blown, but there's a box up there in Travis's possession  that has a body fat analyzer in it that I shipped up there.  Oh, a body fat analyzer.  So it's not really a weigh-in.  It's like body fat?  Well, you get weighed as part of it, but then it counts.  Oh, shit.  I smell fear. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, hi, Rob.  Oh, shit.  Rob Cross, one of the guys...  I smell fear.  One of the guys that babysits the fucking channel.  Oh, no, no.  Yes, Rob.  Hey.  Hey, Jimmy.  No, the word portly was never used, and...  Oh, yeah, it was, so...  Not by me.  Well, he said it was used to him, so how can he...  Oh.  So you're calling him a liar?  No, no, no, no.  Or you call him a sponsor a liar?  This is uncomfortable.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh, you call him a sponsor a liar?  No, no, no, no, no.  When we decided not to do the prostate exam, I called Steve and said, that's all we're going 
[00:56:30]  to do.  Yeah, let's get the fat asses.  No, no, no.  We may do something else.  Oh, what?  Okay, come on.  Come on.  Look, management 101, how to get out of a situation from three disc jockeys that I'm  about to kill him.  And go.  We may do something else.  Yeah.  Related to a physical fitness challenge we're going to do.  Plan B.  And at that time, I didn't know who the contestants were going to be.  Where are we going to weigh the contestants, Rob?  Was that discussed?  That's up to the show.  I don't care who the contestants are. 
[00:57:00]  I wasn't going to weigh nobody, Roland.  I didn't even know about this.  Backpedal.  Me?  Or Rob.  I said, I won't be weighed in.  That's what I just said.  Yeah, yeah.  And I never argue with you about that.  Yeah, but then somebody told him something different.  Like, poor people.  No, I just told him, work out the details of it with Travis.  Do whatever you want.  Steve's got a...  What do you got, Steve, in your bag of tricks?  A body...  A caliber.  Dude, they are making announcements over here.  I can barely hear you guys.  But I've got a body fat analyzer. 
[00:57:30]  Body fat analyzer.  It's the same thing.  No one wants to hear body fat analyzer.  Here, I'll save you the whole hour of radio.  90% body fat.  There you go.  Are you happy, Rob?  There you go, 90%.  We have a lot to say about this.  I'm not organizing the weigh-in, the physical fitness contest.  I mean, really, it was all just us coming up with something else for Dr. Steve to do.  I'm sorry, passing the buck on the one?  The particulars of that contest were totally...  Yeah, totally passing the buck.  You are?  The particulars of that contest are totally up to the show.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  It's different than what they told us from the ladies. 
[00:58:00]  How is that talking?  Ooh.  Rob Cross is in studio with...  Okay, he doesn't have headphones.  Okay, okay.  Yeah, I thought it sounded like Rob.  I was going to say the person that started this name rhymes with flaw, flaw, but I didn't know  that it was okay to mention it.  I couldn't hear what Steve said.  He's saying the person that started this, his name rhymes with slob sloss.  Oh, I'm not working here.  So unless his name also rhymes with Meave Matter, I think they're saying it's you. 
[00:58:30]  Or Phil Farmerson.  No, the particulars of what we do with Dr. Steve are entirely up to the show.  And who participates entirely up to the show.  Yeah, look at Schwarzenegger's lawyer.  He did nothing wrong.  Here we hear Rob Cross.  I know what's going on here.  Yeah.  There's a lot of backpedaling going on, absolutely.  Yes.  Because they didn't realize Roland's sensitivity.  No.  I kind of know that sensitivity.  Oh.  We've seen it over the years.  Oh, yes, yes.  These guys assumed that Roland was just going to go with the whole, you know, fat thing. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Be weighed, have the fat analyzer on his body, and now they're realizing how fucking pissed  that makes Roland.  And they're all kind of backpedaling and saying, well, that's not what we were thinking of doing.  That's exactly what we were thinking of doing.  Right, Rob?  No, well.  I'll participate.  I'll run.  I'll do whatever you want.  But I'm not going to be weighed or be fat.  Yeah, that's what we were thinking about doing.  But I didn't take it for granted that Roland was definitely in on the contest.  Roland's mad because this was supposedly a surprise that was blown by Dr. Steve yesterday. 
[00:59:30]  I don't think there was any surprise about it.  No one told Roland what this involved.  And then Steve blew the surprise yesterday on the phone.  That's what I'm getting out of this.  I don't know what's real or not.  Roland's told me from the beginning he's on the bubble about doing the thing anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not a surprise.  And then you guys would say you have to do it anyways.  And then I go, figure, I'll compromise.  I'll do it.  But just don't be weighed in.  Which is fair.  Yeah.  I wasn't trying to get you on a scale.  I was under the impression that Roland wasn't doing anything.  Yeah, me too. 
[01:00:00]  Ah.  Roland.  And I was completely fine with that.  Well, then I figured you two were going to make me do it.  So I figured I'll have a backup plan.  I won't be weighed in.  Measuring.  Are you there?  Yeah.  I was just going to say, measuring stock or pad or, shoot, stock or paddy's body fat will  be hilarious.  You think measuring stock or paddy's body fat will be funny?  No.  Oh, you are.  You actually got me.  Sorry, Dr. Steve.  I'm Chip Norton.  I didn't actually catch that you were saying that.  A little sarcasm. 
[01:00:30]  I didn't catch that.  All right.  See, but if you did it to E-Rock, you wouldn't care.  People have different sensitivities.  But with E-Rock, if you give a gift to somebody else that was meant for you, then that's his  sensitivity.  That's his sensitive area.  Right.  But I guarantee you, you could put a fat analyzer on E-Rock and he'll fucking brush it off.  That's what you consider.  Everybody who looks at E-Rock is a fat analyzer.  No disrespect, Eric.  Sorry.  This shit writes itself sometimes.  Oh, God.  This is bad.  Am I right, E-Rock?  Nope.  You would get mad at that.  I'm not doing a weigh-in. 
[01:01:00]  I'm not taking the shirt off anymore.  And I'm not doing the body fat thing.  Wow.  What the hell happened in the cemetery?  Dissension in the ranks.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  The fuck is happening?  Rob.  Yeah, I'm not doing it either.  That's not...  You've got to get control of the situation, Rob.  It's honestly not my bit.  I just thought it might be something funny to do with Dr. Steve.  And we had all discussed it in a couple of meetings with the show.  When you mean funny, making fun of Roland's... 
[01:01:30]  No, no, no.  Making fun of Roland's body fat.  But doing a weigh-in with whoever might participate in this contest.  Making fun of fat people in this company?  Because I know five.  Ooh.  What?  Making fun of fat people.  I know five fat people in the company.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  If they think it's funny, I think it's funny, too.  Oh.  Oh.  Jesus.  What's going on?  Dr. Steve's getting airport announcements. 
[01:02:00]  It's all right.  Okay, they're giving me the Lord.  We'll talk about this.  And for anybody with a medical degree, too cheap to sit in a first class, please turn  your phone off.  I guarantee he's in road 17D.  Aw.  I got a middle seat.  Steve, can you put your phone on speaker for a second?  Yeah, yeah.  Hang on.  What are you, nuts?  No.  No, you're going to get kicked off the plane.  Steve?  Is it on speaker?  Yeah, you're on speaker.  This guy has a bomb! 
[01:02:30]  This guy has a bomb!  This guy has a bomb!  Do you realize that they take that very seriously?  Oh, my God, no.  You just say that it's not a bomb, it's a fat analyzer.  Why would he put his phone on speaker?  I don't know why.  I was going to yell Allah Akbar, and then he yelled that.  But you beat me to it.  All right, Steve, we'll see you in, hopefully, when you make bail.  All right, there goes Dr. Steve. 
[01:03:00]  He'll just tell him he's Dr. Steve, and they'll go, oh, everything out of his mouth is a bomb.  Just like that.  A prime example.  Roland, a lot of guys on Twitter, you're their hero.  Right now.  Because you're standing up.  I know Ronnie B is the big-time hero, but today, you, my friend, are a hero.  I know, I mean, I'll participate, but just those two things.  You're just mad that they were, like, holding info back.  Oh, yeah, and throwing this.  And who are you playing?  Travis, Danny, Rob Cross? 
[01:03:30]  Who do you hate from one to three?  Yeah, yeah.  We need your hate meter.  Well, my hate meter?  Your hate meter.  To my left, a big whiff of shit's come under my microphone.  Oh, wow.  We literally had a conversation about this yesterday.  I never said a name.  I never said a name.  Oh, good point.  I'm not the only one to your left.  We should be sensitive.  There's a lot of people to Roland's left.  That's fair enough.  I did jump the gun thinking you meant to his immediate left, which would have been Rob. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  And then who, so is that the most hated?  Because Rob is trying to pull one over on you?  Yeah, because Steve goes, oh, we've had multiple conversations about this.  Yesterday we talked about it.  We did.  Who's your second hated?  It is like, if I'm, like, a spy with Osama, don't worry, buddy.  You won't die tomorrow.  They come and kill him.  I trust you, people.  Second most hated.  Well, according to Dr. Steve, it would be Rob and then Travis. 
[01:04:30]  Wow, Travis.  It had nothing to do with this.  Rob talked to Dr. Steve, and then Dr. Steve took the ball and ran with him.  Travis is such a sweet boy.  He said, well, they said poorly fat guys, so we figured you and he rocked.  That's what they told me.  That sounds like a Dr. Steve thing, though.  He assumed.  That's what he said you said.  Oh, shit.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  All right, Dr. Steve is right now being body cavity searched.  And coming.  Put it in a little deeper.  Yes, sir, you have to stop pushing back onto the rubber gloves and making the yummy sound. 
[01:05:00]  Why would he just casually go, sure, no problem.  Yeah, sure, I'll put this on speaker on the plane so that you guys can yell.  What do you think we were going to yell?  Helpful shit?  De-ice!  De-ice!  My pizza party made the company newsletter.  Did it?  Yes.  Your what?  What do they say?  Never do it again or you'll be in trouble?  No, it's just like, oh, everybody high fives like they had participated in and they never 
[01:05:30]  gave me a dime.  But hey!  Why not?  I missed the first part.  The pizza party made the company newsletter.  Oh, okay, very good.  And people are kind of like jumping on board like it was a great morale booster, a good  thing, but they were not involved whatsoever.  They put in fucking Dime Zero.  Dime Zero.  Never any compensation.  Wow, Roland's pissed.  But they put it in there as like a morale booster.  Yes.  But Roland's embarrassed.  I mean, like he's hurt.  This is his thing.  But we all have these things, like this type of show.  Well, he wanted, first of all, he wanted his pizza party to get, you know, recognition 
[01:06:00]  for himself because he really went out of his way to get morale going around here.  And then the whole, you know, fucking fat analyzer thing.  Yeah.  Put him over the top.  That's a little much.  And now you know...  What happened over there, Puerto Rican?  Oh, shit.  Mars.  If you're looking for Mars, anybody is either here or gossiping to the security guards or  sleeping.  Holy shit.  Now Mars is getting up.  Wait, wait, wait.  But I ain't talking about your fatness. 
[01:06:30]  Am I ever?  Wow.  He's awake, guys.  I found him.  I found him.  I found him, Troy.  Do you need anything?  I found him.  He's like, where's Waldo?  Now everyone knows why I bring him around when I'm making videos with fucking crazy people.  Hey, Eric.  In the booth over there.  Do you have Eric laughing horrendously at your fatness for about a minute and a half?  Roland.  What is it?  Sam has it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  Yeah.  We should probably just give that a whirl since Roland's so fucking vexed about this. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  What?  It's a fair point.  I mean, it's like, and I love Roland, but this year, this one, this is like, it's like.  Talk about the audio of you laughing historically because of all the fat jokes that were made at  I could see those guys not.  We were both close friends, so it's fine.  We busted each other's balls.  I could see people not knowing why this would be so sensitive for you.  Yeah.  It's just weighed in.  That's the difference between being weighed in and being on air.  Oh, shit.  Now the big troublemaker is in. 
[01:07:30]  How do you feel about young Sam Roberts?  Yeah.  He is what he is.  He's a shit star.  A shit star.  As he runs in with this.  This is Roland listening to us beat up E-Rock.  This is disgusting.  Yeah.  You put each other balls there, can I?  But we're going to be way together live on air.  It's fine.  I laugh.  I'm like, did I?  I'm sick of it. 
[01:08:00]  I'll eat.  I'm sick of it.  I'll make it.  i'm sorry i'm sorry about why are you doing this to me 
[01:08:30]  see it's jamaican jimmy yes he does have good taste in comedy  that's the best thing i've ever heard all week long thank you jimmy jimmy jimmy we're back live so 
[01:09:00]  obviously that was hold on roland listening in as uh jimmy was doing jamaican jimmy about the uh  the ice cream balls yeah because iraq likes to eat sugary stuff we eat together we both each other 
[01:09:30]  balls like brothers but it's fine but it's not on the air we're not being weighed in together  but you could see like what like you participate in the show where people wouldn't realize  like almost like if they it's like if you had said like that day like well that's kind of  fucked up they shouldn't go after that and then these guys tried to sneak that in on you that  would be shitty but it's almost like the way we actively participate we're all kind of cool with  it it's like people don't know what somebody's hot button is so that's one for you that's like  fuck man that's embarrassing i can't do that because you're either gonna say take out your t-shirt be 
[01:10:00]  weighted and then they'll take pictures and pull over the fucking internet yeah that's what i don't  want all right but that's fair enough i wouldn't say the guys are scumbags and believe me i would  throw these fucking shitheads under the bus in a second but on that one they you can't expect them  to know that because it's like with the way we participate you know what i mean it's like  listening to that i would think that you're totally cool with that type of humor you're not sensitive  about it you're gonna take this shit from jimmy no but you know it's it's a fair point he was  willing i'm just he was willing to participate in this challenge but that was his i could see why 
[01:10:30]  guys wouldn't know he was that he was that sensitive it wasn't like he wasn't willing to  participate yes it was uh possibly being held back some info yes where he could decide what he  wants to do not they were going to humiliate him the thing is on the last i had heard about any  kind of participation was i guess two days ago on tuesday and i vividly recall roland saying that  he was not participating in this whatsoever okay yeah but like everything else so what's a note to  you guys is yes i was like you know you're gonna do it so it's true i don't care i think there was 
[01:11:00]  intent there to not do it i think before roland came into the studio he wasn't doing it and then  after he got onto a mic he said that he would do it as long as he wasn't waiting oh at least we  got eric bobo and and eric we got you right eric's gonna kick some ass eric is now found he is like  he's latching on to roland yeah and and like like a union they're uniting against this this is how 
[01:11:30]  nazi germany got started right exactly that cannot see the point  eric is there a reason before this came on air even on tuesday rob came in and told me  hey welcome back this is what you're doing on friday it's a sales event and all that no i'm not  i was not involved i was not i was not involved in any meeting discussion i wasn't asked and then  just like you're doing another bit about your weight so that they can make fun of you for being 
[01:12:00]  out of shape and i said rob go fuck yourself i'm not doing this and then he goes wait wait what do  you mean you're not doing this i said nobody asked me or told me about this you're just you're coming  and saying hey this is what you're doing is he building his own team i hear like team eric in  the booth has team eric begun is hysterical wow damn it things are changing around i know damn it  wow no one is happier than the scale 
[01:12:30]  so wait bro's not doing it eric's not doing it eric's not doing it roland's not doing it uh so we  have stalker patty and bobo in a physical fitness challenge thing i and i don't understand how  eric and now if he doesn't want to do it that's one thing but the the reasoning that that you know  pretty much your your boss told you you were doing something and you're just saying no wait i i didn't  hear what eric's exam of headphones mars don't you know how to do radio rob mars yeah don't you know 
[01:13:00]  how to do radio um eric said you welcomed him back and told him what he was doing  you told him like i don't know how this even became my here's what you're doing  oh now what was the last like what was the last oh man backpedal what was the last bit that i  like oh put your head down there thank you that i rounded up on our guys for the show i mean it's  just like this is one of those things that was come up with a long time ago it's just a matter of 
[01:13:30]  who would participate i'm not married to who participates thanks or doesn't participate so  you know what i find strange that that you're here this early oh and he came on the air rob  comes he's coming on the air now uh so you know you got to give it to him yes right a little tender  backside iraq so rob you could force iraq to do this right yeah i would think you could force him to  do it yeah i don't think i can force eric to do it i think you can he's being defiant you're  belligerent he's being um uh uh insubordinate i don't think this is in his job description 
[01:14:00]  so i have to check his job description i don't think it is i mean to see what his job  let's play this out iraq if rob cross forces you to do this bit what happens you can't force me to  do it  he's got he's building his own little army this is scary it really is he can't force you  what do you mean by that iraq because this wasn't just something like hey we just came up with it 
[01:14:30]  now we're going to participate and and and do this this was something that was planned weeks he just  said weeks in advance i find out about the details when i come back from my from my honeymoon  and it was sold this is not shitting on the event this is not shitting on the sponsor it's just this  should have been discussed or at least approached to us not that hey this idea is sold you're doing  why we can't why we can't why is he turning off he's never had positive feedback he doesn't know 
[01:15:00]  what it is he doesn't know how to handle it he's never been voted for iraq but but now what you're  saying is is that you now the only thing you're disagreeing with is the spontaneity of the whole  thing no isn't that what this show is based on it isn't that some of the things you've done in  the past have been very spontaneous yes but part one was this your it was sold and then i was told  you're doing what's the big problem with it being sold by the way exactly who told you you were do 
[01:15:30]  one who said you're doing this and two you did no i didn't you did  i didn't sell it to dr steve as anything dr steve told us yesterday that he knew about this for  weeks now and then he was amazed that we were just finding out and that we were saying no to this  he was he was informed that we were locked into this event oh was not told to either one of us 
[01:16:00]  i mean that's totally assumptive on dr steve's part because really what happened was said that we  decided not to do the process this is the alternate idea who participates is entirely up to the show  in the promo in the copy that he has biggest part of the gentleman that it says i'm participating in  it it wasn't sold on the basis of you participating that's not how you presented to me  the rock is turning into norma big gene i think eric's got the entire staff behind him now oh my god 
[01:16:30]  i don't even understand why this is happening this is craziness what happened to fun loving uh roland  dead dead this place is just today out of them maybe no the pizza party thing is the one thing  that is really pissing him off well did they not give roland credit for the pizza party they did they  didn't it dominated the company newsletter actually i had like three i thought you said it you didn't 
[01:17:00]  get credit understanding because some credit yeah i'm not understanding some credit any of eric's  argument i'm sorry am i i i don't understand one thing about your reasoning for not doing this  i understand roland's reasoning for not wanting to do it is is you know a pride issue like fuck you  i'm not taking my shirt off i'm not doing this i'm not but you it's this weird it was sold which i  don't know what difference that makes i was told when i got back from vacation even though this was  planned weeks in advance who cares we just say uh uh yeah hey we're doing it participate why not 
[01:17:30]  uh so i don't understand any of your reasoning okay like i said that was part one of what i was told  all right part two was when the event was being explained which is where roland is also upset was  that this was a weigh-in that we were going to be weighed and knowing this show probably you got to  take your clothes off or something else to do with it and then then compete in these uh physical fitness 
[01:18:00]  activities right which we also found out there was also going to be embarrassing statistics to them  if we can only do say like six push-ups right then there was like well you know 11 year old  girls 90 of 11 year old girls can do six push-ups 79 sorry oh uncle paul now so what if there is no  weigh-in and no shirt removal will you do it will you do the event next friday i would  you would roll it roll it says he yes like he could do the fam i'll go as far as he brought the 
[01:18:30]  fat thing he could do to me but i want to get my t-shirt it's a little caliper thing i guess i don't  even know my teacher as long as i won't get away okay i would honestly uh be interested to see what  everybody's uh shut up yes yes i i would be uh interested to see what my body would you really  fiona apple body mass index yeah it's easy for you to say that you exactly you weigh 11 pounds  with a 10 pound weight in your hand he's gained a half a pound in all these years are you are you  kidding exactly how many producers on this program oh damn i have gained quite the weight in the last 
[01:19:00]  year uh yeah yeah uh irak um comment comment on on whether you would do this if it doesn't  involve shirt you don't have to take your fucking horrendous shirt off no  all right now i see now i completely don't understand why i know why his wife got to him  and said oh shit you have to put your foot down and make the earth shake no matter what it crushes 
[01:19:30]  yes listen there's a lot of precious china and i'd like to remove it from the shelves you have to put  your foot down no she but she probably said look if you're sick of this because you're a married man  now you know yeah yeah i'm not throwing her i love her but she's like you know this is my husband  and he's being embarrassed and he's coming home depressed and uh she's that part of it uh iraq  no that's not part of it oh she didn't she didn't she didn't say to you like uh look you know she 
[01:20:00]  didn't kind of help you no no no if if what not not in this sense no so what is it am i being  brilliant for this one too oh no you're not what is it yeah i explained one i don't know i know that  and then two was the details that we thought we were well now we're saying and all this other stuff  this is what started all right all right we're saying no way in no shirt removal why won't you  do it i just want to know that's i'm not saying you gotta do this i don't give a shit i just want 
[01:20:30]  to know why you're not doing it god join your honeymoon  why iraq all right i'll say this all right oh here we go because i'm not it's obvious it's  fucking obvious i'm not in shape okay so logically one would think he's perfect for this contest  yeah but be part of tv right now there's other like everybody else on this staff 
[01:21:00]  skin especially like sam he's skinny but i guarantee he's not in shape he couldn't do most  of this stuff all right so what if sam is involved in this no because sam is the first to run and go  oh e rock and roll e rock and roll perfect for this contest to totally deflect to have him out of it  or travis out of it or danny or derrick or any of those other people so now automatically goes right  to me but this sounds a little more competitive now if we do get sam roberts involved and you  wouldn't you like to show him like look i can fucking outdo you or uh you're just uh in the 
[01:21:30]  same shape i'm in or what have you you used to be an athlete right iraq yeah in high school yeah so  that's so that's the bit you fucking take on sam and shut and shut and shut him down  that's you i think that was sam yes at least he's finally agreeing with the haters yeah  yeah yeah and that's what everybody thinks of them yes uh okay uh that's the bit really if  if roland's cool and i'm i'll be cool with roland used to be no shirt off no weighing that kind of 
[01:22:00]  right right yeah back in the day but then you get some of the other guys on some of the other guys  just because they're skinny or whatever you're saying doesn't mean that there's a guy on staff  who's going to get goofed on when other people aren't willing to do that and who gives a fuck of  if bobo can do a sit-up or not no one cares  i say you take on sam and show him what you're made of yeah that that would shut up a lot of  fucking people man fuck him i think this is great because i don't think sam would care if he 
[01:22:30]  sam wouldn't care if he couldn't do push-ups yeah sam has no interest in whether he can or can't  he's a bitch  yeah but sam change your voice the people would the people would be like wow e-rock  the people they'd be like wow e-rock fucking shut him down uh he can't say a word about e-rock  anymore yeah you just brought a little prick sam roland you've had it with sam too huh roland  yeah it's just like you get angry then you look at him and you know he's just become a bigger 
[01:23:00]  shister so you just go oh this is a this is the other role we will yeah i love sam though  the other role we'll be happy by tomorrow there's two different sams on air and then off air oh man  oh shit it is i love sam though he's a shister sam here and then he's a good guy out there  you're a good guy outside the studio i don't want people to think that what part  yeah i don't want people to think i'm a good guy outside of here no no yeah i say the same shit 
[01:23:30]  huh who cares who cares who cares if i'm a good guy when these mics are off what difference does  it make exactly i'm who i am on the microphone to you that's it you the listener not you anthony  well no i understand because then i was the listener they don't get the privilege they don't get  the privilege of hanging out with you when you're not on exactly right yeah but they think they  know you because what they hear and i love that i tricked them all but listen as far as this  contest goes yeah i'll dominate e-rock and rolling oh shit he does care he does care he 
[01:24:00]  does care all right now we're getting this this is now jelly we should get handicappers and fez here  oh shit oh shit is that nice yeah someone said you were really would you called him a creep or  something yeah well that's the publicist called him so i just oh you don't like fez right  no i do i do like him i love him why are you rolling your eyes but uh the publicist uh said  what who's that creep over there oh shit but more importantly sam has said yeah i'll take your 
[01:24:30]  fucking challenge sam is up for the challenge e-rock are you now this whole contest has mutated into  something else e-rock are you now in are you going to take your ass and so we can only do three  contestants that's that's what like oh look who's scared because look who's double written for the  legal aspect of this what why can't we throw a fourth fucking person in this why can't we put a  third a fourth number of our own staff on it what does that mean what's that got to do with anything 
[01:25:00]  give me the legality of this bullshit throw me in baby i'm not a lawyer but i but when you do a  contest like this for whatever reason does it involve the listeners you have to decide on a  certain amount of variables does it involve the listeners or no yes i don't yeah how does it  involve it's content because we're we're it's contest we're choosing three listeners to be  attached to these people and then the winner of this contest then make it four wins the pocono  look i don't need anybody attached to me what if there's no one attached to me i'm going this  with the sam army the one man band fuck wow he's a rogue one i don't understand why you can't 
[01:25:30]  just say now there's four yeah i don't understand why you can't do that either but i'm not a lawyer  are you going to you don't have to be a lawyer you have to be a person that says now there's four  i don't get i don't get this this is amazing yes absolutely i don't get it either anthony  let me go in wrong i don't need to change it i don't need anybody attached to me i'll win this  competition i understand i'm just nobody goes to the poconos if i win nobody goes to the poconos  oh shit i'm one person i want to take the prize away from the listeners nobody goes if i win 
[01:26:00]  yeah she'll always love that lawsuit however that happens that's fair enough i'm stunned you can't  just say now there's four no no you can't because because what i i could lawyer crap but i'd love to  know that even the people sue i guarantee people have sued before because people sue for everything  because they're cunts and then the fucking the company start panicking because they don't want to  pay legal fee you know it's all what could possibly be a lawsuit they should be able to 
[01:26:30]  wait i i agreed to coming out of this contest under a certain set of rules but all of a sudden the  rules change that that by changing the amount of people you change the odds i never would have  went in if i knew don't the rules say that the rules can be changed aren't the legal rules that we  have the right to change the rules at any fucking time they might be and if that's okay so we'll change  i would assume any lawyer worth his salt would put that in the fucking rules good point you could  change the fucking rules you're right maybe that's right four fuck it that's right now it's four 
[01:27:00]  anthony casey now it's yes now it's four so maybe it's corpus that is true it does say rules are subject  to change right yes it has to danie's got subject to change oh danny's searching through volumes of  crap legalities to these contests it i guarantee you there's a line in there that says rules subject  to change at the fucking solitary discretion of the fucking dick fuck that's putting on the contest 
[01:27:30]  but more importantly is eric legal jargon i'm sorry is he gonna do this with sam yes he's gonna because  we don't need fucking bobo the the story here is sam versus zero i was gonna be so sad what was  bobo's out i've taken him out of the competition and eric is going to lose he's going to be  embarrassed once again by sam are you going to do the again physical fitness challenge  i'm going to beat eric on a physical and mental level every single area that a human can be beaten 
[01:28:00]  and i will beat eric eric i'm looking at the rules here on the website and it says that those who will  be competing will be o and a pest in parentheses o and a super fans i'm a super fan baby i love this  show so if that's the case super fan i'm a super fan i listen every day if that's the case you're in  man you you're a super fan but i'm a fan there is you're the biggest fan there is you got all the  we'll figure that shit out uh this could be a side thing i don't give a fuck if we have to stick with  the rules that's fine but we could also be doing side shit that's that's obvious so are you going to 
[01:28:30]  take on sam in the ona physical fitness challenge do it you stop looking for excuses and just say  are you doing it you're going to be defeated here it is yes i will take yeah eight days from today i  will wreck you and more importantly now rewind the tape and i told you he would do it no matter  thank you thank you you played into my fucking game oh shit oh rewind the tape oh nidge ouch ouch that hurts 
[01:29:00]  oops now i'm looking at i'm looking at this and now he's not even going to win because i'm in it  he would have been bobo he's not gonna beat me you don't see bobo he would have killed him he would  have destroyed now he's not gonna beat me that's for damn sure so you don't think so no i'm on team  eroc for the record wow i got two hundred dollars holy shit this this is taking on a life of its own  yes put your money in my money is for eroc you're gonna lose i'm gonna cost you a lot of money put  more money my money is on eroc put in for i know that's a twist but i'm telling you right the fuck 
[01:29:30]  now i'm thinking of taking the bet i'm thinking of taking your bet you're gonna go with sam  i think i might i might go with he's a fucking veal and take your fucking bet veals are delicious  that's right i might have to go you know what this is a wrestling turn but i'm going with  fucking eroc with the baby before you make a harsh decision yeah eroc how many push-ups do you think  you could do i think you can get four oh well i mean to be fair eroc's titties are a lot closer to 
[01:30:00]  the ground to start with so i mean they're gonna be easier for him oh the smack talk is already  is already starting wow it'll be easier for him show your muscle though all right look at that  this is what you're dealing with and this is a do you really want to do this got a lindy gaga shirt  on do you really want to do this oh man there's nothing there i've never seen a bicep go completely  straight across there's nothing there as far as the bicep goes it's tendon strength  you have arms like olive oil you really there's not even a hint of a bicep do you really want to 
[01:30:30]  do this ad wow now sam's muscle that's that's made his muscle that whatever is there that's all made  of like like pizza rolls and and whatever chicken fingers chicken fingers yeah yeah high protein  while i'm not saying that eric's muscles are not made of the same substances eric muscles is made  of powdered iced tea i feel that eric has more muscle mass but he also has less weight to lift during  push-ups or sit-ups a lot less and let me tell you sit-ups have you seen the thing that he's got 
[01:31:00]  in the belly doesn't matter eric's working with that's a lot coming into studio eric's coming into  studio don't touch me eric don't touch me don't touch me yes before the fight you could smack talk  but there's no uh no violence like a weigh-in like a boxing weigh-in yes exactly eric i was just coming  in to hear him and shit talk so oh he's saying that um he's got cake in his ears  oh jeez he's saying that you have too much of a gut to do sit-ups probably and that you're too 
[01:31:30]  heavy to do push-ups probably i'm backing you even if your arms are bigger let's see a bicep let's see  uh compared to the uh all right he's got a bicep he's a lot of fat over it though a lot of fat  i don't know yeah i i gotta really consider this bet when it's post time so i could uh i could  handicap these motherfuckers before i place my back let's let's see if they can handle  10 just 10 push-ups what are you talking about no i don't i don't want any no no you can't because 
[01:32:00]  that would show you you don't want to improve that you don't box around during the weigh-in  yeah i don't want to uh we do get to see uh some level of no competition i got 200 on eric we saw  the biceps that's um why are you shaking your fucking head because you're going to lose that  money i'll tell you what i get to keep it eric's not comfortable being the fucking winning horse  he's not comfortable being the one that's the favor he's not comfortable being the favorite is  too much being the loser and you don't have confidence and let's win this fucking thing you got 
[01:32:30]  it 200 bucks i'm taking sam yes yes 200 bucks i'm taking sam  somebody makes a winner's bet somebody doesn't have the confidence and that confidence is a big  thing huge thing i have ten thousand dollars because that's what i make a week  oh damn what a lie i'm betting 50 bucks 200 bucks on sam roberts uh against eric well yes if you  are you doing a rope-a-dope thing or are you just without the rope 
[01:33:00]  you can't train on the xbox 200 dollars oh shit here's why i made a smart bet here because  eric doesn't give up you you didn't think that eric could finish a whole jar of mayonnaise eric  finished the job see there lies yeah the problem yeah they're addicted to sit-ups and push-ups  that's like saying well that crack addict smoked 11 vials he could do push-ups so basically what 
[01:33:30]  you're saying is as long as we dangle something in front of eric's face yeah you're gonna raise  it and lower like a fucking chicken wing no make him do push-ups into the mayonnaise like  officer and a gentleman when he's out in the puddle well if we are looking to do a fourth person the  last time we did this travis beat everybody doing the the push-up contest i have no problem doing  it but eric's trying to distract from the issue i mean starting from the issue no the the big thing  here is sam versus eric how many push-ups yeah that's a big that's the main event one that's  the main event you're right let's say hi to bobo bobo oh god who's bobo yeah yeah yeah i heard i 
[01:34:00]  my speakers are working so i heard that i i heard that you people were trying to kick me out of the  contest i ain't going for that all right hang on i will beat eric so he got a competitor how many  how many push-ups are you going to beat eric by  i don't know what this would be i could beat him by 10 all right 10 but you were talking so much smack 
[01:34:30]  on the phone the other day how many push-ups do you think you're going to do push-ups and i can  beat him where are you now i'm having bad difficulties with push-ups where are you now  bobo oh no i'm i'm outside where no in front of my house why you don't want to wake up your mom  yeah all right why don't you put the phone down on the sidewalk i want to see how many push-ups you 
[01:35:00]  could do right now put the phone right next to your mouth and count them out all right sir  there's too many people outside who cares who cares you gotta start doing push-ups put the phone  right near your mouth so that when you go down to the ground you can count off wood yes and and keep  going we want to hear how many push-ups you could do we want to see what we're up against or else you  can't come on the show right band life band 
[01:35:30]  hello yeah are you doing the push-ups yeah yeah i would did yeah i am doing it all right  difficulty well you gotta count off you gotta go one yeah you gotta count them out into the phone  as you do them yes let's do this all right guys i'll do this all right go ahead a lot of people  six seven eight he's counting his toes 
[01:36:00]  eight of them  what happened after eight  what happened  uh there's some people freaking complaining that they're blocking my way asking me to move 
[01:36:30]  so bobo said he could be to my ten so eric makes the point that eric just has to do negative two  push-ups yes uh i did eight i'm gonna be doing more there okay just a taste right yeah yeah that's it  just showing off a little bit showing off yeah anybody want to put uh money on uh bobo anybody in  the house here anyone no bobo's got no action and now he's got some great odds though you know i mean 
[01:37:00]  does have look who i mean fifty to one that's that's gonna pay yeah yeah there would be odds on  that one uh not like the uh eric sam thing which is even money um even money me and opie have made  a two hundred dollar bet opie is taking eric i'm taking sam opie it's not gonna feel good when you  gotta give anthony that money no shit it's not gonna feel it's gonna happen you have to tell me it's  going to have every dollar is precious you're going to give him that cash damn man rock not even  confidence eric any confidence that you could beat sam no he'll do it he won't or is he just 
[01:37:30]  playing it off like i can't is he a winner for one i think he's not a winner that's the thing about  eric you could he could flex all he wants he wasn't born a winner flexing i didn't want to do this in  the first place exactly he's a natural born loser he's not a guy who's born to win anything he's  never won anything in his life he probably never will i'm debating because you think this is uh he's  playing what what did ali used to do play possum was it he would he would he would uh he did the  rope it up against foreman my question is though because iraq has done physical didn't we see sam 
[01:38:00]  do something physical and he wasn't good at it i don't know why he sucks at physical shit he does  he's a fucking he's a lanky girl body i thought sam did something that wasn't have you ever done  anything physical for the radio show uh for the radio show i know you sucked a lot of dick for the radio  it wasn't a dick it was a dildo and kissed a lot of men kissed three men uh i don't know if i've  ever done that yet no physical shit no i refereed the push-up contest so never a physical i don't

[01:42:30]  because you humiliated him this way and next week he'll lose you 200 oh you know yeah then you'll  be even you have a reason to throw this iraq you know what if you had one ounce of balls yeah right  when you're about to beat sam you look at me and go fuck you fuck you and stop right there oh you don't  even have to worry about that because you won't have to throw it oh that'd be something you won't  need to the rock never took a dive unless it was into dessert what was that bobo he's gonna look like

[01:49:00]  christmas dopey poster stupid poster ah shit i gotta tell you my brother sent that picture i tweeted last  night and i went to bed an hour late because i was just reading fucking comments we have people  funny ass listeners they were losing their minds over this picture uh losing their fucking minds and  they also appreciate that my brother has a nice saw yes that is a big ass uh what is that a dewalt  i don't know i've never gotten my hands dirty it looks like dewalt yellow i have no idea oh no 
[01:49:30]  i i think you're right yeah i could be i remember reading that yes you're right yes all right we're  gonna finally break bill burr is here playing carolines all this weekend oh shit  there he is as we take a break hey bill bill we haven't uh taken a break yet so we're gonna do  that and we'll get to bill burr next stay there the virus get in touch with the opian anthony show  866 wow one wow send your feedback to feedback at opian anthony.com opian anthony 
[01:50:00]  let's do this bill burr in studio playing carolines all weekend long and roland just uh walked in here  to tell me that all the shows are sold out except for sunday night at 10 30. added show sunday  10 2 1 2 7 5 7 4 100 and even those tickets uh roland saying not many left for sunday's 10 30 show  that means bill burr is fucking huge well i have this youtube video where i get kicked in the balls 
[01:50:30]  on a unicycle and it went viral that's how you make it now has nothing to do with material i like how  there was no laugh people like really is that what you did we don't know yeah it's like you never know  anything but the jokes though yeah exactly uh me and bill we're talking a little hockey and i think  we're both in a group are you going to agree to what i said okay my heart says the bruins you have  to say the bruins because you're a boston guy right but i this is the best i'll say i have a bad feeling  that not only tampa's going to win this series i think that they're going to win the whole thing 
[01:51:00]  i think so too that's that's who i'm saying is winning the stanley cup i just i don't it's only down  to 14 so it's pretty easy to say that now but i think i think tampa bay lightning have uh the skills  and they got the hot goalie right now yeah they got they got three fucking snipers right as they  say in boston and i i don't believe in vancouver and san jose because they they're playing streaky  hockey which you can't do in the playoffs i'll tell you if i'm vancouver i gotta be thinking  i really sound like one of those morons but i that's what i really and i just and look at 
[01:51:30]  rollison he starts out on the islanders who didn't have a chance after november 1st and now he's got a  a run at the stanley cup at 43 years old i know but we actually knocked him out of the game last  uh last time you know who's the funniest guy to watch who to read about hockey is uh in boston  is uh dan shaughnessy because he fucking hate that he watches he doesn't watch any of it and he knows  nothing about hockey but everything about the red sox so somehow he builds every article around  i'm telling you people in boston just watch that subtly how he'll work he worked in like when we 
[01:52:00]  play in uh the canadians he worked in the curse of the babe right that was the foundation of his  article boston bruins verse uh he like last last article i read that that he wrote about hockey he  actually worked the pesky pole i'm like jesus the pesky no it it reads like some kid you know when you  had those blue book tests and you didn't know the answer and you're like all right i got i gotta fill  up three fucking pages here so i am really really really excited you know you said i looks exactly like 
[01:52:30]  east side dave by the another east side dave look like that guy that guy knows baseball he knows  basketball but he does not know hockey let me so let me take that let me just he he filibusters his  way through the whole thing let me take that thought another guy that is a hardcore sports guy for the  city that doesn't know hockey mike and uh the mad dog when they were the big fucking sports uh  show here in new york never talked hockey and and basically admitted they didn't like it and now that  that they're that's how that it's two separate pretending but now it's two separate sports shows 
[01:53:00]  both of them don't really do the hockey thing they do a little bit how are you you're you're a sports  talk a sports talk guy and you don't do hockey i don't understand that's why i love and this guy  doesn't do it either up there in boston that's why i love it hockey is a rogue sport even for the  guys that are supposed to follow a rogue sport for their job they allow fighting most people don't  understand why do they let them fight you know and like i love when people ask me that question  because then i just know i don't need to talk to you for the rest of the evening because i never 
[01:53:30]  questioned it the first time i saw it i'm like they can fight this is awesome yeah exactly that's  what of course you don't even think twice about it yeah and you understand why the fight is important  in hockey that's why when the nhl tries to fucking clean it up a little bit there's an intimidation  thing you know do you know that to start the uh i think to start the sharks vancouver series the  two captains are out there uh i think i think kessler's the captain i don't know but uh what's  his face uh jesus christ joe thornton they come up for the opening face-off two goal-scoring all-stars 
[01:54:00]  and thornton looks at kessler goes want to fight just to start you know awesome the series would be if  they did that just started yeah duking it out right yeah two goal scores it'd be like you went to  high school the two nerds just started battling it out you'll be like oh fuck everybody this is  gonna be awesome this is great that gets everyone pumped instead of the enforcers going at it like  what is this really happening kidding or no no he was dead serious yeah yeah that's what hockey's 
[01:54:30]  just great i don't really have it i don't have a team in it i don't even have a second tier team in  it right now so it's kind of tough to watch yeah i gotta say i think tampa bay's gonna win it  yeah i didn't even know rolson got knocked out uh the other night i didn't i didn't see that game  the violence kids are watching they're just gonna emulate it's bad i can't do baseball anymore  at all i'm slowly coming around i haven't watched in two years once uh really once uh one particular  red so my favorite red sock tested positive for something and i was just like ah you know what i 
[01:55:00]  can't who's your favorite i'm not even gonna say his name okay i'm gonna say his name but he did a lot  of damage a lot of damage to the yankees and i was like finally this is the savior and then two years  later oh actually he was on horse tranquil we haven't proven it yet and i'm like yeah  just you're really gonna you're gonna take the fairy tale away from me living vicariously through  this as if something great actually happened in my life figures right yeah so i haven't been able to  watch steroids just about all of them the only ones yipping about it i still count the uh whatever we 
[01:55:30]  did against the yankees because i roided up guys beat your right it up guys it was it was a fair  oh you're talking about anthony i'm a mets fan oh yeah yeah you guys took the roids for some  reason but i'm not really a mess they didn't take with the mets yeah they got some shitty roids  they had a horrible dealer yeah i don't know what they cut your shit with but uh they're buying it  from bernie madoff you didn't get the good stuff yeah it made you peter out in the end of september  sorry was that right no it was my it was no it was my bernie madoff riff what hysterical horrendous 
[01:56:00]  that was good it was terrible oh i liked it all right thanks i thought you wedged it in there kind  of nice yeah i thought it'd be clever because the whole scandal but i was wrong i picked an old  scandal yeah i know but it's like my bumper sticker says clever doesn't always equal funny does it  it's almost after the anti-social shows are you yes i've been opening up that it's beginning big  laughs all over look at i love when the little kids fucking fight because they're emulating their 
[01:56:30]  fucking fight they're emulating their fucking heroes that's me i'll watch you that's hilarious  what happened to the two little i've learned that on youtube anytime anybody says best something  something ever it never is it sucks it never is but that's like the joke i can uh i i get tweeted  links that just say hey anthony and it's a link and then i take the time to click on it i'm like why  the fuck did i do that oh yeah it's never good it's never good and it's usually some piece of 
[01:57:00]  shit that i've seen already i got a good one i got a good one type in uh oh teacher hits student  dude this is like one of the greatest uh oh slaps to the head i've ever seen teacher hits ah right  here right here teacher hit teacher hit student crazy wow see there's two people they're sort of  joshing with each other every time the teacher turns around they're fucking with each other the kids are 
[01:57:30]  turn it more towards us sam the teacher keeps catching them this is the second time do not do this oh  shit does it again when the teacher turns oh is that real oh yeah why did they stop the camera  right after that because they're probably afraid they were next yeah watch how he braces himself  like he's going to do something he sort of leans to the left and then freezes and takes it right in  the chin watch he fucking open hand i'm gonna tell you right now that's why other countries are 
[01:58:00]  catching up with america because that's still legal look at that that's right you shut the  man when the windmilled him okay he came all the way around there's no excuse that that kid couldn't  block that yeah true hey he telegraphed it more importantly who's the douchebag that had to  dislike that probably the guy who is probably the one who got knocked on the floor yeah there's always  that little dislike that you're still ringing  that would be you know that we can understand that but yeah who's the guy who's the asshole that 
[01:58:30]  has to dislike that is there one dislike that's a great video 28 dislikes 28 dislikes seriously that  guy fuck what a lesson we learned here don't fuck around in this guy's class that's that's a great  video uh bill burr's right uh we'll tweet that no one no one fucking sends me those though there's  another one in there there's there's some fight like a del taco and it's it's three against two and  the two the kids who just have two they win and there's the one of the kids who starts it with 
[01:59:00]  the three he he gets knocked out three times in this fight it's it's fucking amazing oh he catches  a uh he goes to punch one kid and he misses and then he's just sort of his chin's hanging out there  steps in hits him he does that classic lawn dart fall you know where your whole body just goes limp  like a slinky and you just go head first into the dirty tiles of a fast food restaurant and then  then he slides from the grease from the french fries a little bit right then the other then it's  now it's two on two right then the key he comes to right as he comes to somebody kicks him in the 
[01:59:30]  face he's out again and then the third wow yeah he he gets like basically uh probably three concussions  in this fight brutal never lands a punch it really is i i do like the fight uh videos uh especially  fast food fights i like those because they're always like oh shit this is cray cray motherfucker look at  it and they always got to turn the camera and go this crazy fighting yeah because they got to get 
[02:00:00]  themselves yeah this is getting on youtube and then they did there's some good fights in there too you  know you get to an economic level where it's you know me or you yeah you know when you when you're  in there with the whole family getting the 99 cent meal yeah yeah oh that's a good punch oh there  was uh there was a video that um i saw yesterday i guess some guys are playing shenanigans with that  purse you see that one there's a purse on a string some tomfoolery anthony some tomfoolery and shenanigans  guy uh and and they had a purse on it on a string and it was in the middle of the road oh that's 
[02:00:30]  hilarious and people were like stopping to get it and when they pulled reach down to get it they'd  pull the fucking thing and it would scare the shit out of people and it was all fun and games and  funny and that's hilarious so this black couple pulls up and the woman uh gets out she goes to get  the purse and and she it gets pulled away and she goes ah like it freaked her out right so she gets  back into the vehicle and i guess goes around the block and the kids reposition the purse so she drives 
[02:01:00]  and stops right on top of the string and so they try to pull it and it's hitting the tire then she  gets out and starts pulling on the fucking pocketbook and breaks it from the string to  fuck up these kids gag i guess so then the kid walks up and goes hey give me my purse back and  shit and uh this black guy gets out of the fucking car takes his shirt off he's built like a brick  shithouse and just going go to fuck home man go home you best go home he's ready to kick the 
[02:01:30]  shit out of this little prank prankster white kid and i think the only thing that stopped him was the um  his chick kind of was getting in between like you know if you beat up this little white kid you're  going to fucking jail it's over i get so mad you're gonna end up on youtube i don't know it's  fucking it was i don't know maybe the purse matched her shoes yeah yeah she really wanted it  but this guy just instantly gets out of the car takes his shirt off and now he's just 
[02:02:00]  fucking showing these amazing fucking muscles and she's like he'd have killed the kid too  that's really old school did he put his hands up like the fighting he was like yeah the fighting  irish stance come on see put up your dukes yeah what is it the marcus of queensberry rules  is that what you have to fight by put them up put them what are the rules i don't know you just got  to fucking uh punch someone in the face till they fall down yes no there are yeah there are no rules 
[02:02:30]  yeah on a street fight there are no rules just hope there's no camera around when they see the dirty  shit that's it that would get you a 20 game suspension there's i hate when movies have like  clever moments like that there's only two rules number one obey the rules number two there are no  rules oh you don't like that in fight club you didn't like that in fight club in fight club oh sort  of no i don't know you don't uh rule number one rule number one was you know i don't think we 
[02:03:00]  quite knew what you were talking about we didn't quite know what jim was talking about what he said was  actually hilarious and then when we didn't react he just goes you know what i'm talking about  that was the equivalent of i'm just saying i'm just saying i'm being serious i'm not trying to make  a joke guys i did do that i hope you picked that up uh arnold schwarzenegger bill burr big story 
[02:03:30]  yeah now we're here in the love child is what in college i mean 14 his age gets yeah it was older  every day when now it's now we're up to 14 14 14 year old and the pictures uh the pictures look  exactly like a young arnold what's your take on this because we're basically saying what a pig  the woman's um she's a yeah it's a little reckless  yeah tad reckless look i mean even the younger version of hers yeah but it's rough to look at 
[02:04:00]  here's here's oh dude i'm telling you right now she she did some things to him that his wife never did  well that's yeah come on figure that out oh you know what i thought that that was actually i didn't  say it said tmz i thought that was actually writing on her dress yeah that's some new  style of clothes um what do i think uh who hasn't you know  shit what you eat you know we've all done it the next day woke it up going good lord my two worlds  have just collided how am i gonna how am i gonna uh finesse this one but this guy i was saying to 
[02:04:30]  jim he took uh shitting where you eat to the to the to the end yeah i don't know where you go beyond  that that's as close as you can get really yeah yeah she she was at the house talking with the  wife the wife was commiserating about arnold's affairs with her really she was complaining he  has affairs and the woman's like well it's just the way he is and i guarantee can you believe that  well yeah believe it or not i can yeah marina schrader price said one thing that made this woman  want to fuck him like he just can't i mean this big austrian caucus so thick i don't know how anybody 
[02:05:00]  takes it if she was the house the house person there that means when she had a kid at some point  what's her name maria yeah she probably held the baby oh yeah and took a picture oh yeah they had  them five days apart they had kids five days oh look at her face is kind of gone like with her that's uh  that jaw's awful wide baby had a little flat top and sunglasses on yeah  yeah kids are terminated oh chip oh fucking chip well now uh our pal ian halpern saying 
[02:05:30]  there could be up to six six women or six other children six other children i think you know i  think uh i i think you can't judge somebody for doing some shit like that until you've been in  their position with that level of temptation i think it's very easy to be an out of shape slob  shuffling to and from your piece of shit you know i saw this thing one time uh russman eve 
[02:06:00]  told me about this show they were showing people who won the lottery and it's the greatest show how  it ruined their lives they were this guy one after another big slob worked at like a home depot or  something you know married his high school sweetheart love of his life just one of these great guys if he  died straight to heaven express lane i never did anything bad he wins the lottery all of a sudden the  hottie at home or whatever the fucking place was starts paying attention to him and he didn't know 
[02:06:30]  how to handle it next thing you know he starts banging her he gets caught his wife goes it's over  here and he goes fine he moves out and after three days he's like what am i doing so he calls her up  to get her back and the wife says go fuck yourself and then he hangs up all dejected then she goes what  am i doing so then she drives over there to reconcile with him about time she got over there the guy killed  himself holy okay this guy stepped into schwarzenegger's world for like three weeks and he  couldn't and he couldn't take off himself and schwarzenegger for 14 years this poor bastard has 
[02:07:00]  had to live with his fame and power yeah for 30 years he's a guy he's a victim why not why not play  it safe there bill burr that's my question wear a bag or maybe pull out make sure you're not getting  women pregnant because look the same way old people still say colored instead of african-american  this guy is not going to wear a bag he came up in the 60s and 70s there was nothing you got a shot  in the ass you were fine he's just living by the old old school rules man and probably in the end he 
[02:07:30]  doesn't give a shit he probably didn't even like maria shriver oh it's the kids involved though oh  that was a marriage of convenience for his political career i'm thinking you have to understand what  this guy accomplished in his life and how yes how like under like um just invincible he must feel  yeah yeah there's no way a guy who talks like he talks should become a movie star 
[02:08:00]  a love interest how did he do that could do a movie with danny devito when it's a huge hit none  of it makes sense and then becomes governor my fellow americans uh california he probably said  comrade during his fucking political speeches and he still got elected why wouldn't he think he could  he could go raw and bang his fucking housewife we will have a kid and you will shut up and she did 
[02:08:30]  and she did and they fired her and that's why she i was threatening to talk and that's why it broke  i forget why he had to tell why did he fire her yeah i think that it was you know maria wanted her  fired because of uh she knew she found out i wonder if the kid was just looking too much like him and  people were starting to know there's something happened something that's set in motion where the  fucking lady had to do is sit down with her and just say look she found out so obviously you know  just out of respect for her this is how it's going to go down all right i'll make a big show out of  it i'm going to fire you but you're still on the payroll yeah don't worry all right i'm going to 
[02:09:00]  take care of you and our kid you know i love our kid just say all the shit you guys set you up in a  nice place yeah once women feel like uh the the gravy train is over yeah yeah that's when uh they  make their next business move which nowadays is to write the book yeah yeah go on tv you know it's coming  yeah the dejected uh scorned woman yeah well uh she'll say some shit that she uh she what did  photoshopped schwarzenegger's head on a picture of tiger woods and sent it to him 
[02:09:30]  get ready for the next week you want this but they would fuck unprotected in the house during the  day it was an ongoing thing i feel i actually feel bad for his wife because she remembers every  conversation she had with that woman i don't feel bad about his cheating she knew  it was she's stupid for fucking hanging in there like that she knew she had to know years ago  yeah she knew why the fuck did she stay in it because she had because you want to be  nah that's bullshit i think it had more about uh the power of the whole thing but she is she left 
[02:10:00]  no she's a kennedy man i think i think that's a good point there's an element  of okay so i'm gonna leave this guy i'm gonna but she's a kennedy though so she does have  money she's not impressed by power she's she's fucking she's she's like but she left her whole  career and she's but that's what i'm saying she left a very prestigious job to be with him she  loved him california that's that's way the fuck up there she went before that she went for 20 years  25 years yeah but he was just a movie actor yeah she loved this guy she's again she's a 
[02:10:30]  fucking kennedy man they're used to powerful people i think the love left that relationship a long time  maybe and she really was cheating too she knew i think it's a world we don't understand it's a  whole power thing and sure she's a kennedy but you want to keep that power going and maybe that  would fuck up the kennedy power that she's a weak you know that this happened to her so maybe she was  hoping that she could keep it all together you know what i mean kennedy was i mean kennedy i think uh  schwarzenegger was just like a fan of politics and he was like fascinated with the kennedys that's  probably why he married him kind of like yeah cage married like elvis's daughter yeah yeah you know 
[02:11:00]  right i think can i can i wear his blue sway shoes you know yeah and i think can i go upstairs  bracelet you know you just like got such a fan take a dump on the death yeah then he sees the  toilet he's like oh i gotta fuck her forever now let me ask you this why what's the tours over  oh god i married her why are the clintons still married it's a power thing they're not in love  with each other but they know they're better uh their careers are better if they're still married i  think they're two peas in the pot in a pod how would you say two peas in the two peas in the pod in 
[02:11:30]  the pod yeah i think they're the exact same they they choose uh yeah they choose the whole political  thing it's better for us to stay together that's way more important than the love aspect of this  whole fucking thing yeah yeah i think there's some of that i'd play here maria shriver i really do  well she she played she actually got to run for president just because she was married to one  it was one of the most hilarious right hillary never would have fucking been able to  do that right yeah if i watch a plumber fix my sink should i then just be a plumber you're a 
[02:12:00]  plumber i stood next to him when he fixed it you're qualified enough is enough enough is  enough it's one of the worst speeches i ever saw no the worst is i'm something long way what would  she say i'm that when she's spoken to the black congregation did you ever hear that she was trying  to oh is it bad add in a little uh southern uh you know how we do yeah yeah oh she's  fucking horrendous i never something something tired i like what she she gave that speech and 
[02:12:30]  she goes if she comes here she want to run for whatever the fuck she ran for here in new york  she had a big yankee fan yeah yeah i've always been a yankee fan senator clinton and her campaign took a  trip down south apparently said iraq said listen to this i don't feel no ways tired  i've come too far from where i started from  is she quoting a speech  he told me that the road would be easy i don't believe he brought me this far 
[02:13:00]  to leave me and the chair of all the mayors in the country mayor palmer from trenton new jersey  wow that travel in the world funny but that travel in the world has  fucked her up she doesn't sound or look anything like there's not a genuine bone in her fucking  body there's not a genuine bone in her fucking body or her husband's but it's a joke about a 
[02:13:30]  picture of feminism and strength and all she do is stay married to a guy who dump loads on everybody  but her and she's your idiot friend who just took shit and like bill said because she was married to  a president she got to run for president with that happens in politics all the time when one of these  guys dies all of a sudden their wife becomes the congressman yeah that's weird that's  fucked up like sonny bono's wife is a classic example she still is you don't want to get life  insurance if as a politician right yeah not only are they going to get money they're going to get a 
[02:14:00]  great job get your gig but how does that make sense i want to go up to the thing and say stuff  people clap i also think it's time to get this country back to work  all you have to do is read it off the thing  why why do they allow that i like parades  they allow that in that world it makes no sense why is it a national story donald trump announces  that he's not going to run for president like he was this legitimate candidate yeah that was 
[02:14:30]  ridiculous jimmy had a great take on it where he you know sacrifice what you had a great take i  don't remember just basically where i can't run because i'm going to take away my tv show  instead of instead of running all right instead of running the free world he'd rather tell some  fucking third-rate celebrity that like fucking you know what i mean yeah he's an idiot he's an  idiot he's an idiot does everybody who rallies to evade did he basically say the country needs him 
[02:15:00]  him it's time he needs to turn this thing around this country is bankrupt and i've gone bankrupt  right many times this year i know how i know what it's like to be bankrupt i know how to get out of  it but i'd rather have a cupcake making contest with fucking third-rate celebrities did you ever  hear this expression neil brennan i was talking to neil uh neil brennan and he was just talking  he was talking about like certain how certain rich people act and he made a good point like people  who are he goes uh um he goes yeah someone's born on third base and they act like they hit a triple 
[02:15:30]  like talking about like children of privilege i thought what a great way to fucking phrase i don't  know that's neil's expression but i'm like what a fucking great way to say that is god i wish i  thought of that yeah that would be yeah that's him in a nutshell you know what's happened there jimmy  i daydreamed halfway through that that's okay that happens on the show the way i've been the way i've  things i've been saying everyone should be daydreaming as soon as my mouth opens it's nap time for the  audience you had to say it the second time and then i actually got it i think i'm a little uh overtired here 
[02:16:00]  yeah a little punchy you go out last night no i'm just on uh west coast time i couldn't fall asleep  till two in the morning because you're excited about doing the show right absolutely yeah i always  get excited that fucking happened i i slept yesterday too late you guys i come in i shake your hands like  i'm running for fucking office i know i am bill burr bill burr from the fifth district  i think it's time for change my blue or red tie  no and then you'd start telling me about the hardship of your life and i know this camera's 
[02:16:30]  there so i just sort of strike some pose that'll make it look like i'm really listening well you  know i've been out of work now for uh quite a few months and uh it's hard raising a family  uh on uh unemployment now i reach out i put my hand on your shoulder yeah yeah  every takes the pictures yes we just want work we just want an honest uh day's work for an  honest day's wage you see i have a blue tie on that means i care about you i see that thank you  hey you got my vote okay i'm gonna get my jobs but i get the job get get america working again 
[02:17:00]  and the thumbs up thumbs up and i get i get back in my my my lincoln town car stretch limousine  i told you guys that story that i that time i met bill clinton no i tell you that he was coming to  town he was giving a speech and uh my brother wanted to go he wanted to go down there and i was  like dude i want to go he's like nah come on it's gonna be great so he gets me and one of my other  buddies biggest fucking pothead ever we could give a shit i'm hung over  so we we head down there and we're all he all he wanted to do is see the motorcade go by with the 
[02:17:30]  super uh the secret service so we're standing there waiting and as it's coming down the street  it gets about 50 yards away from us and it makes a left down this alley and i'm like great yeah that  was fucking awesome so he goes into something like woman's college or something to go to make  a speech so my brother's like all right this will take like 45 50 minutes i'm gonna go grab a slice  then we'll see it drive by so we're standing like dude this is fucking ridiculous right brother leaves  to go get a slice of pizza like fucking i swear to god eight minutes later crowd starts  going crazy clinton starts walking down the street it's him ted kennedy and they do like 
[02:18:00]  this impromptu just shaking hands of people the secret service is freaking out going everybody  keep your hands up have your hands up where we can see him we're probably about three deep standing  behind these police barricades and he came walking by and he didn't say a fucking word he had both  hands as this is gonna be bad radio bit he had both hands in the air and this smile on his face with  his mouth open like yeah like he was going oh that's what he looked like but he wasn't saying  anything and i'm looking at the guy going this guy's fucking retarded right just a photo but then the 
[02:18:30]  next day in the paper he looked like a million bucks he had his hand up and he was like he was  laughing with all of us oh shit he's he's he put both hands in the air like he was gonna like you  know give me uh a fucking high 10 i guess and then he just had his mouth open he just struck a pose and he  knew that would look great in a still photo and walked right down dude he looked like like he had  an aneurysm but somehow could still walk and how softest fucking hands ever really and then ted  kennedy came by dude with this giant microwave head and i'm just thinking how did he not get 
[02:19:00]  assassinated this shit a five-year-old could take this dude out from fucking across the river  you see oh you should you should clinton's hand i i more like like high five he just he just i  thought he just walked down like like you would like you scored a goal you know everybody just  you just yeah yeah and he just he just had a that's all he did and he looked retarded  where was your brother like that look yeah like he was on skype and his face froze that was basically  it and he just was walking down the thing there it is look at that look at that that was it that 
[02:19:30]  was exactly it that's his look mouth a little bit open smiling he figured that shit out a long time  ago yeah because because when you talk you're gonna have like that twisted you know you can't talk  during a picture so you freeze your face walk and the still picture in the paper looks great no  matter where you are because they always want to use the one picture where you look like  shit so here's the best part here's the best part so this all goes down in like 20 seconds they jump  in the motorcade and drive away and within like a minute all is left is those little police horse 
[02:20:00]  things you know stay behind it you know and then some litter and we're standing there going oh  fuck and then my brother comes back a slice of pizza and he goes oh he goes did i miss it and  we're like yeah yeah yeah dude we uh we shook his hand he really goes fuck you and he didn't he  didn't believe me but then he saw my pothead friend he was doing like this sort of side gallop in a  circle high out of his mind going i shook it twice i shook it twice there it is there's his there's 
[02:20:30]  his face he knows he knows how to do the face make the face because it looks like he's either  listening or answering yeah or being good natured he is a smart guy man reaching out to the people  yeah yeah yeah he's not a dumb guy i need to make a connection and they tell the crowd to keep their  hands up huh probably on a walk like that i think yeah pre-9-11 wow when a president could be like i'm  going for a stroll yeah yeah i'm just gonna walk a little bit gerald ford tried to press the flesh  yeah four john and squeaky didn't like on the and there was somebody with a gun like that's why 
[02:21:00]  they're so afraid of letting you walk he tries to walk and there's somebody with a gun on the  fucking he was supposed to be in a fucking a car yep yeah oh well that's a great story hey what  what would happen if you yelled gun oh it's a practical joke yes you're just doing the clint eastwood  impression gun you would be so just to watch people in suits hitting the pavement oh you would so  fuck speaking of which have you heard from dr steve uh i guess he's flying up i guess he's still 
[02:21:30]  flying yeah yeah yeah actually he did say something hopefully right now he's writing his  fucking last will and testament on the back of a fucking trade table said the flight attendant gave  me the look while you guys were phoning in that bomb threat oh i'm pretty sure she couldn't understand  what you were saying or i might have gotten uh a talking to by security our pal dr steve's flying  up from tennessee so he's on the plane with his phone so i go hey put your phone on uh on speaker  on speaker why would he do that no problem he doesn't even think twice so i start yelling he's 
[02:22:00]  got a bomb he's got a bomb jesus christ  yeah but jimmy i beat jimmy to the punch because he was going to yell the ala akbar yeah  i just got in before jimmy that's all god is great  god is great they say that for everything yeah god every video you watch of them that's all they  say no matter what they're doing oh so it's usually something that religious fanatics are uh are some 
[02:22:30]  of the most scariest people because they're not afraid to die on on all those all levels right  right levels and it's just it's a bet they think it's gonna be better and they don't see the irony  of your last act on earth is killing innocent people right somehow god's gonna be all right with  that and you're gonna go to a better place yeah he's using me he's a tool of vengeance  yeah he does work in mysterious ways i don't even know why i'm doing this  it really is frightening yeah but uh i watched a lot of those videos and man it doesn't matter what 
[02:23:00]  they're doing they're just yelling that out i was i was gonna i was gonna give you um a compliment  today oh really yeah because you know how everyone thinks you're a whack job for like of course walking  around your house armed well yeah osama had nothing on him and he had a home invasion  see it's your whole home invasion thing home and that was a  uh bin laden didn't have anything on him yeah nothing i gotta tell you what is to try to fight  him off is how long he stayed alive i actually thought about that if an entire nation was trying 
[02:23:30]  to get me like how long it would take them to find me to be on the lamb like that yeah especially this  nation with predator drones and all the fucking yeah i i would yeah how long do you think you  would you would find me in a wooded area within a mile of my apartment shivering trying to lay  prone next to a log yeah think how hard it would be to hide when you watch those shows like cold case  files and uh uh i almost got away with it and shit like we're on the land for like sometimes a few 
[02:24:00]  years right and uh it all they're doing every day of their existence is please don't make today  the day i get caught and trying not to get caught to the point where some of them just go back home  and go i can't take this anymore lock me up yeah like they it just gets them that crazy dude i i'm  addicted to that show the first 48 oh i saw did you see the one where they ran over that poor guy  with the car in the park and he had those flank steaks went flying all over the place i didn't 
[02:24:30]  see that one so this fucking okay it's one of those you know 48 you know first 48 hours and they're  counting down by like 46 minutes and they already got one guy in there right because he had already  he had an argument earlier came into the guy's house he owed him 60 bucks and he threatened to  kick the shit out of him like the whole block saw that and then somebody saw his car at the scene  so yeah he's down there turns out he was he was with somebody else so he's sitting there 
[02:25:00]  and they're waiting to go they're like yeah so we're waiting to interrogate the guy and the guy's  pacing back and forth like one of the worst jobs i've ever seen of trying to get out of it just pacing  back and forth and the guy comes in he goes just sit down just sit down so the guy just sits there  and he goes uh he goes do you know so-and-so he's like yeah sort of rocking back and forth and he  goes yeah we uh we found him today he's like oh yeah where was he at and he goes uh he's dead and he just  goes back he goes what oh shit oh what he got killed i didn't do it he never accused him it was 
[02:25:30]  the first thing he said i didn't do it the guy goes why don't you just sit down and the guy's  sitting there going like he's it was the worst acting job i've ever seen so then he starts so  then he just lets him sit with it just let him mulling over right fuck they got me i don't have a i  don't have an alibi and then this is when they always get them when they take that one knee and they  put that hand on the shoulder just going you know you got a lot in your mind yeah yeah i didn't do  it man the guy was cool man he was cool you know like freaking out i love that one where they do they 
[02:26:00]  put the hand on the shoulder they go look things happen maybe maybe an argument and spur of the  moment mistakes are made but the best thing you could do for yourself is let uh you know tell your  side get this off get it out we we know we know what happened we just need to hear your side and and  it's like they all they usually crack they must never watch the show because when you see the cop  whenever the guy goes yeah i want to talk to a lawyer the cop goes okay they get up they shut that 
[02:26:30]  door and go god damn it like whatever's making the cop mad that's what you want to do yeah and it's  always when they lawyer i saw one where this one dude was just so fucking hardcore they wanted to  kill this guy they killed this guy and tied up these two women and he fucking shot both of them in the  head one one of them lived yeah i saw that one yeah yeah and when they were sitting there going  like uh yeah and she actually was able to survive come come around and i and uh identify uh you you  know it was one of the shooters and he goes wow it's goddamn heroic he said something like that yeah 
[02:27:00]  goddamn heroic right and then they and he goes i wasn't there and and uh they they just they were  getting so fucking mad because they couldn't crack him why don't you just just show that you're a  human being and this guy would not nah he wouldn't crack there's three types of people there's i want  a lawyer and it ends right there and then they haul him away yep then there's the never crack guy and  then there's the oh here it goes here he goes oh you idiot he said it all well we were smoking some 
[02:27:30]  crack and you know things he pushed me and i i thought he was going to kill me so it's so  fucking riveting watch i saw one time the guy he just finally admits it and then he and he starts  crying the guy's like 21 it's like it's over your life is fucking yeah yeah you ended a life the whole  thing it's over yeah and he just he started crying this big dude crying go can i just go home and sleep  in my bed one more time i was like he just he turned into like this little six-year-old kid that's 
[02:28:00]  all he wanted to do yeah and you know what's funny is that the cop i said that in front of the cops  see that you know they would probably flip out like yeah don't listen to that shit he's just  saying that yeah we had offers to so-and-so listen to that next thing you know he's got his own piece  in his mouth yeah you know that show is un-fucking-believable they're gonna get somebody killed  because they don't yeah they don't do anything to hide the witness did the rat they just show their face  no they they already got somebody uh i think the camera crew was going in with a team that was supposed 
[02:28:30]  to get one of the suspects and um it was like the wrong house or some shit and somebody got shot  and uh yeah yeah so that was i think they stopped going out with this uh teams that would get who got  shot not a member of the tv show no no it was uh like i think a girl got shot in the house i'm not  quite sure all the details but imagine living in a neighborhood like that you're doing the right  thing and you're sitting there pouring a bowl of rice krispies and i was like get on the 
[02:29:00]  fucking ground search warrant you know that big fucking yeah bust any door open thing that they  shot in the leg swing and you just what the fuck this yeah wrong guy is this 27 maple street no 27 elm  maple's the next one over you can't sorry about the door and you're fucking the shit in your pants and  yeah yeah i saw one on youtube they went in the wrong house and this guy had like pitbulls and they shot his  dogs oh yeah he freaked out he was on the ground and he goes what happened because the wife was

[02:31:30]  a group around him and there's someone throwing matches at him and he keeps like trying to step  on the matches it's comical at first it's funny blowing out the match when yosemite sam tried to  cook him ah what are you doing and uh eventually it took yeah he went up  that's the thing when you listen to people complain about their lives yeah sometimes it's just like  hey can you beat this yeah yeah top this yeah they're burning your people alive from being  witches because we're only i don't know what these guys like being a witch is one thing but it's like 
[02:32:00]  that's justifiable no i mean that's kind of silly but it's like who knows what these guys did half  the time like sometimes we'll say they were rapists like you look what happened in connecticut  like either one of those guys that killed a doctor's family they should have been either one of them  was burned alive in the street and you knew what they did you go good i would have meant that classic  yeah that was too good for him too good too good for him it should take a rusty knife and all right  what's your scenario exactly it's not gonna happen i saw a video of uh some guy laying there and they

[02:36:00]  One. Wow. Send your feedback to feedback at obianthony.com.  Obi and Anthony.  Bill Burr in studio. Bill Burr on Twitter. 
[02:36:30]  Bill Burr Carolines.  And, of course, the podcast doing very well for Bill Burr.  Monday morning podcast every Monday.  Every Monday.  We're going after you next, man.  We signed up Joe Rogan, and we're coming your way, Bill.  We're coming your way.  Got to run back to the plantation.  Is that what it is?  I got my freedom on the Internet.  On the intratubes.  We would love for you to join this fucking show.  Maybe we can figure it out.  You thinking of a video?  Doing a video?  I find videoed radio shows just kills all the magic of it. 
[02:37:00]  Really?  I like sitting there.  Like, the great thing about radio is you can do other shit as you're, you know, as you're listening.  And you can laugh and drive and do all that type of stuff.  But I just never found, like, you know, sitting there watching someone with their headphones on.  Unless something insane happens, like when we threw that shit at you and, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But other than that, it's just guys sitting in chairs riffing.  I like the idea of being able to show, like, visual things on thematic shows.  Like, if you have, like, I'm going to fucking look at other people's podcasts that do video podcasts and just goof on them. 
[02:37:30]  And that way you can put it up and do shit like that.  Like, that's kind of...  Yeah, because then...  I like that.  It's thematic.  Yeah, then you're giving them something to do.  But if it's just going to be like you going, oh, this is a little paper.  Schwarzenegger, can you believe this?  I hear you.  That's lame.  But I'm starting to get some advertising on my podcast and stuff.  Yeah, I hyped this thing this week.  Cage vs. Cons at the L.A. Coliseum.  It's real cops vs. real ex-cons MMA style. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  There's not a guy I've met who didn't go, what?  That was one of the easiest promos.  I'm like, I don't need any copy.  I got this one.  I got this one.  I can't fucking believe I'm going to be out of town when this is going down.  That is some hatred there.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  It's...  Yeah, that's funny because they're all talking respectful for one another.  You know when it goes in there.  Jesus.  You know, when we're in the ring, it's just a mano a mano.  We're two men.  No.  When I was inside, you know, I was a knucklehead. 
[02:38:30]  But, you know, I learned to respect...  You're a valuable lesson.  You know, and as a police officer, it's all about respecting the other man's...  You know what I'd do?  If I was the cop, I'd come down, you know, you always have, like, your theme as a fighter.  I'd come down dressed to one of those, with the truncheon and the shield.  How do they go in and they kick the shit out of you in the cell just to make them extra mad?  A cert team with the fucking shield, the taser shield.  That's a taser shield?  Oh, you see the taser shields?  They're great.  You get two guys on the taser shield and they... 
[02:39:00]  This is gladiator shit.  It's fucked up.  The guy's inside, like, his cell and he's been throwing shit out at the guards.  And he won't come out.  He won't put his arms out to be cuffed or some shit.  And he's wrecking the room.  He's got the toilet clogged.  He's making floods.  They give him a chance to fucking get out.  And then they shove this giant fire extinguisher-sized mace thing into the hole that they put the food through and just blast, fill the fucking room up with mace. 
[02:39:30]  And then if the guy still doesn't fucking come out, they open the door, pin him against the wall with a taser shield.  Holy shit.  It's a shield with this, you know, metal ribbon and tape on it.  And the thing goes...  And then they just fucking tase the shit out of him.  And the thing is, you have no choice but to take the beat down every time.  No, you're going to take the beat down.  He goes, you either do that or you back up like a bitch.  And he goes, you put your hands...  Then everybody thinks you're a bitch. 
[02:40:00]  And now it's like, oh, I guess he's rapable.  Yeah, they've got to take the beating.  That's the taser.  Okay, I'm going to follow up with a drive stone.  You ready?  Do you feel anything?  Nothing.  Why isn't he not feeling anything?  He's got a vest.  Are you ready?  Oh, shit.  Do you feel anything right now?  Nothing?  What, they got a taser-proof vest?  Because she has a vagina, it's going to be different?  He's already done this demonstration. 
[02:40:30]  He did that.  Do you feel anything?  I like how he's a lot higher on her.  Yeah.  Can you feel that?  Right in her pussy.  Yeah.  I don't understand what that's about.  We're going to shoot one probe into the vest and one into his leg.  How's he going to do that?  This is the Thor shield.  For those of you...  That is complete and instant compliance. 
[02:41:00]  Wait, why...  I like the first guy.  He actually said, ow.  I think he said, ow.  Ow.  That was without the vest or the back of the vest doesn't work?  That was one in the vest and one in the leg.  No, no.  The second part of the video when they turn around.  Right.  That was weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I didn't get that.  That was, well, that was one probe hit the vest and another one hit the leg. 
[02:41:30]  So apparently it works if both probes hit the vest, you won't feel it.  But if one probe hits...  I'm with you.  I didn't get it.  No.  I just thought it was funny to watch people hurt.  Yeah.  Maybe they're showing that the taser does work at the end?  Well, it works if there's one...  I think it's like hockey.  You know how you don't have that protection on the back of your...  Right, right.  Like a slasher.  I never understood that.  Every game is like, you know, there's not a lot of protection back there.  Why don't you just make it wrap all the way around? 
[02:42:00]  How fucking hard is that?  If that happens every goddamn game.  Every game there's a guy that gets pissed off at another guy as he's skating up the ice,  two-handed to the guy's calf, and the guy goes down like he got fucking shot.  And then he's like, there's not a lot of protection back there.  You ever put those fucking pads on?  It's three-quarters of the way around.  Just make it wrap all the way around.  Kick-o all the way.  That's what I'm going to sell late night.  Next to the guy with the snuggie.  I'm going to sell shin guards that go fucking all...  And they cover your calf, too.  And just have the guy take a two-hand of the back leg and be like, 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I don't feel a thing.  Are you sick of this?  Just have a guy skating up the ice.  Are you sick?  I still laugh, but...  Phil Burr's shin guard.  There is a lot of protection back there.  $19.95 each.  Act now.  Get a cup with it.  We'll send you a second set.  Just pay separate shipping.  I like to put it in the same box.  I still laugh at your ShamWow joke.  How you had an easier time wiping up a spill with a plastic bag.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking...  That's a great line.  I think it's a notebook.  I like plastic bag better.  No, you said bag. 
[02:43:00]  You did say bag.  Oh, yeah, dude.  I wish I fucking created that.  That was you.  Notebook is funny, too.  That was before you knew how to use the ShamWow.  I didn't know you had to get it soaking wet, and then it absorbed all of it, and then you  had to get the paper towels.  See?  I went right to the paper towels.  You still need paper towels with a ShamWow.  Of course you do.  It's just made for fucking cars.  See, when you're wiping up something that's wet with something that's wet, it's kind of  hard to eventually...  You're wiping wetness.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just for cars.  After you wash a car, and you have to shammy at paper towels. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  I want to go back to the Thor shield.  I think I figured it out.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  They're training these guys, saying, okay, you fucking hit somebody, and nothing happens.  They got some kind of Thor shield on it, right?  Yeah.  So this is how you make sure it hurts.  Yeah.  So now I'm with you.  You got to spin it around, and you got to get him to that part where there's not a lot  of protection back there.  No, you have to at least hit him with one prong off of the shield.  Yeah, but he was going up to their leg.  With the one.  Yeah, that was a little odd. 
[02:44:00]  I didn't get that.  Well, maybe, is there something in the vest that makes you grounded in the electricity?  I mean, I'm really getting outside the realm of my scientific background.  It probably just doesn't go through.  I have no idea.  Jimmy, is the shield magic?  It is.  It's a magic shield.  It's magical.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, all right, all right.  Yeah, nothing better than the compliance of a taser.  Yeah.  My favorite one is there's a big black woman on the phone, and they're telling her, get 
[02:44:30]  out of the car.  Get out of the vehicle.  You will be tased.  Can we play it?  They're letting me.  They ain't trying to get me out of the car.  That's a hilarious video.  Just doing paper towels.  Oh, paper towels.  What is it called?  Paper towels on YouTube?  It's basically a guy.  I think I probably contributed to 100,000 of these views.  It's a guy doing the ShamWow shtick, but he's just selling you paper towels.  Paper towels.  Okay.  Hey, it's Steve here, and I got a big surprise.  Here we go, folks. 
[02:45:00]  It's paper towels.  Put your hand on it.  Wipe it around.  Look at how strong you can't even rip.  It rips if you pull a little bit too hard.  Look at this.  Take it down.  Put it on the table.  Rips again.  No big deal.  Stick it in the water.  Look at that.  Look at that.  It just soaks up all the water.  They're perforated.  They come right apart.  Crumble into a ball.  Throw it in the air.  It comes right back down.  Holy shtt, I spilled soy sauce all over the place.  Oh shtt, I spilled it all over the table.  You can do this.  Look at that.  It's wet.  Then you get a wet paper towel.  Unroll it.  Rip it off.  You pull it up.  Barely even a stain. 
[02:45:30]  You can't even notice.  Just one more.  And then again, now you just got a crap load of squares.  Look at all these squares.  Put this in a frame.  Give it to your mom for Mother's Day.  Oh my gosh, you spilled some water?  No, not anymore.  Paper towels.  It's a kite.  Put a string on it.  Fly it.  It's a kite.  Paper towels.  It's easy.  Look how long that is.  It covers your whole hand.  You can tie it in a knot.  It's still there.  Table's clean.  Kind of.  Hey.  Hey, you can call for your friends.  Hey friends, come over.  I got paper towels.  If you got two, fold this in half.  Put it in your pocket.  Save it for later.  This one, boom.  This is for the car. 
[02:46:00]  The house.  Your backpack.  Turn it around.  Put it on your face.  You know how many friends I make when I do this?  A million.  A million.  You gotta be kidding me.  Paper towels.  You be saying, I got a good grade on my test with my best friends.  Paper towels.  Paper towels are really sold in the store.  Oh, now.  Jesus Christ.  Pit, pit, pit towels.  Not bad.  Yeah.  For 20 bucks, 20 bucks paper towels is too much.  You think so?  No one's gonna buy that?  It's $19.95, Jim. 
[02:46:30]  It's like lodging that number one day.  I think you'd buy it.  If the number's flashing, call now.  Really?  I don't want to call.  I'm gonna do one of those with toilet paper.  Oh, sorry.  We're not gonna take your money.  Yeah?  With toilet paper?  Chip?  How will it go?  Probably just do all the examples.  How many views has that fucking thing gotten?  Two million.  A couple million. 
[02:47:00]  Wow!  Amazing.  It's merely amazing.  You guys see Ted Nugent on Piers Morgan?  We used to have Uncle Teddy.  We used to have him on this show.  I heard about it and heard he was making good arguments for the Second Amendment.  Why doesn't he do our show as good?  I think because we made fun of him.  Uncle Ted.  Sit down and I'll tell you the hollow point poor technically.  We got you, Ted.  You know everything.  We know nothing.  We heard.  Gotcha.  Right.  Good point. 
[02:47:30]  Kind of takes over the room, Bill.  Yeah.  I like to shoot my own two point.  But yeah, well, most of us don't have fucking 80 acres of land that we can hunt our own  food on.  Stupid.  He's gonna teach everybody.  Uncle Ted will show you how to make the bison.  Great.  You hunt deer and I'll go to the fucking supermarket.  You're terrific and healthy and I'm shit.  We got you.  Gotcha.  Heard you.  Yeah.  I just like how he acts like he's a rebel.  It's like, dude, you're almost 70.  I know.  Okay.  Who are you rebelling against?  He's got all of his sayings and it's like a little pat lines that he uses. 
[02:48:00]  I love when he just talks about like eating meat, like everybody's just blown away.  Yeah, most of us do that.  You're talking to 90% of the population.  That also does that.  Look at this meat.  I kill it.  We eat it.  We give it to the homeless shelters.  We're out there doing good things with the hunting and keeping the deer population down.  This is the one thing I do like about Ted is his whole philosophy of securing your perimeter. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  I totally believe in that.  Yes.  Yeah.  Like the end of his movie is not going to be like Scarface.  No.  You must keep your perimeter secure at all times.  He's gone.  That guy is.  Well, provided he's not on tour doing that.  See, that's the big.  That's his weakness.  Yeah.  He's going to have to shoot his way back to his fucking Black Ops helicopter.  But if he's in his compound when the Dalek crashes and everything goes fucking nuts, he'll be fine.  He's fine.  He's in good shape. 
[02:49:00]  Shoot a grizzly bear.  Just sit back and watch it.  Oh, Uncle Ted.  I'm in.  Oh, Uncle Ted's going to be OK.  Yeah.  I'm in a little too much suburbia.  I need like a backwards kind of fucking compound.  You're thinking about it?  Well, I'm a little too much in suburbia.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of hard to have a compound when...  Eventually, you're going to run out of bullets.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm going to have to leave.  By the houses next to you.  I can hold off for a while, but eventually I will have to leave.  But that's where the Mustang comes in.  I could do a lot of maneuvering as long as the road isn't a little fucking cold and I hit a fucking guardrail. 
[02:49:30]  Did you?  Oh, that was a while ago.  I got it all fixed.  I kind of spun it a little.  Yeah.  I'm taking it to Pocono's Pocono Raceway, though.  Dude, I am addicted to all those car shows.  I watch people buy.  Coming up next, a 1991 Chevy Corvette.  Now, these for some reason don't have a lot of value, but I'll tell you people, these things, you know,  someday they're going to be a collector's item. 
[02:50:00]  And you're like, I should probably pick one of these up.  No, I actually watch those and I go, this is where all that bailout money went.  Who has the money?  Like, these guys are just like regular guys high-fiving and they're spending six figures of it.  68 Mustang GT500 is what everybody's waiting for.  It comes out there.  We're going to start the bidding at $200,000.  Fucking 12 hands goes up.  It's like, who the fuck has that kind of money?  Who has that kind of money?  I just end up screaming at the TV.  I got to keep it on mute so I can just look at the... 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, that's an old GTO, huh?  How much does that thing cost?  I don't know if there's a bid yet.  I got a bunch of them.  Oh, do you, Chip?  Yeah, in a garage.  Ah, look at that.  The old GTO.  Why can't they make a fucking car like that?  It's just amazing.  Because there's so many safety and emissions things now, you couldn't make a car like that  that your fucking, your entire, every tooth in your mouth would be through the windshield 
[02:51:00]  if you hit something at 10 miles an hour.  That's only cool because it's a retro vibe.  I'll take a fucking, I'll take a Mercedes S-Class over that fucking day.  I want a gentleman's car.  First time you have to start rolling the window down and actually cranking it.  You get a big ashtray, you bang your knee on, you're like, fuck this place.  You get a power window in this fucking thing.  You know how hard it would be to talk to fucking, to friends of whatever gender they may happen  to be by fucking leaning over and cranking that one comfortable. 
[02:51:30]  I have appreciation for both.  I think like, I would like that.  Trannies and cars?  Trannies, cars, old school cars.  That's the SS.  They're nice to look at.  Look at that, punch that fucker up.  Wow, that is fucking cool.  That's a nice car right there.  Oh, man.  I want to get at the 66 Mustang.  I've actually been looking at getting one of those.  I just try to have the undercarriage updated a little bit and I'll be fine.  That is nice.  You guys want to hear Ted on Piers Morgan?  Uncle Ted.  Oh, Uncle Ted.  Let's see what he's teaching us today.  Look at me.  I'm having a burger.  I'm crazy. 
[02:52:00]  I'm eating meat.  I'm amused by your reaction.  You'll still find that hilarious.  I mean, you're not being amused.  It's hilarious.  I'm on a rock and roll stage.  I just sang a song about feisty.  Wow.  He's losing his fucking teeth, huh?  Let me.  What happened?  He sounds like.  What happened to his voice?  He sounds like Spock.  He's playing.  It's on a video.  He's talking about.  What happened to his voice?  He's making a song about feisty.  I mean, you got to be kidding me.  On a rock.  Did you ever see Richard Pryor live?  How about Sam Kinison?  How about Lenny Bruce?  I'm one of them.  Get over it. 
[02:52:30]  That's some funny.  For a man who is a who is a patriot who purports to love his country.  That was quite shocking.  Disrespect.  Let me put it in official.  I swear to God.  I don't know the story.  What did he say?  I'm sorry.  After making a joke about Obama on stage.  What was the joke he made?  I don't know.  Pierce just shut the fuck up because he made an Obama joke.  It's like, come on Pierce.  First of all, don't talk about anything to do with our country.  Exactly.  A man who purports to love his country.  Is that new guy who took over for Larry King?  Yeah.  Larry King.  Oh, God. 
[02:53:00]  That guy.  He's actually fun to watch because he's so fucking.  The interview becomes all about him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He does do that, right?  Oh, yeah.  We had Larry in here.  Larry King was in a week ago.  He was great.  He fucking was great on this show.  What did he think about this corrupt accountant that took over his show?  You know what?  Why didn't we ask him?  We were too busy asking him about his muffed lines on fucking interviews.  Like some woman saying how she was raped in her car after going grocery shopping.  And after she tells the story of how hard it was, he says the first thing he asked her is, 
[02:53:30]  What happened to the groceries?  He actually said that.  And then he's trying to defend it on the show, why he would ask that.  He defended it.  And how important is this?  Well, you burn a lot of calories fighting off an attacker.  Right.  You might want a sandwich.  Did you have a granola bar or some kind of energy bar there?  Were you able to stop the vaginal bleeding by putting a head of lettuce against it?  Did you throw out the carrots because they were too phallic? 
[02:54:00]  Did the broken eggs in the bag remind you of your own crushed womb?  We'll be right back.  We ran out of time with him.  That's why.  Oh.  We should have asked him.  What was Ted Nugent's joke?  Yeah, let's do this.  Can we Google Ted Nugent joke, Obama?  As Danny's doing that, we'll start to clip over.  So this was after making an Obama joke.  I'm amused by your reaction.  You're still finding that hilarious. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, you're not being amused.  It's hilarious.  I'm on a rock and roll stage.  I just sang a song about feisty p***h.  I mean, you've got to be kidding me.  On a rock.  Did you ever see Richard Pryor live?  How about Sam Kinison?  How about Lenny Bruce?  I'm one of them.  Get over it.  That's some funny s***.  For a man who is a patriot, who purports to love his country, that was quite a shocking  disrespect to your president.  Let me put it in official CNN Piers Morgan in your term.  Shall I?  Yes.  My limey friend?  Yes.  Anybody that wants to disarm me can drop dead. 
[02:55:00]  Anybody that wants to make me unarmed and helpless.  People that want to literally create the proven places where more innocents are killed called  gun-free zones.  We're going to beat you.  We're going to vote you out of office or suck on my machine gun.  You can take it whichever way you want.  Much as I'd love to suck on your machine gun.  I agree wholeheartedly with Uncle Ted on that one.  I do agree with Ted on that one too.  Of course.  I just don't like...  What I don't like is just his self-congratulatory... 
[02:55:30]  Delivery is horrific.  Yeah.  But he is right though.  I mean, and he feels that way fine.  But you're not Richard Pryor and you're not Sam Kinison.  That's right.  I'm beyond them.  I'm Uncle Ted.  Yeah, you're alive.  Uncle Ted, he sounds like a hack.  You know the guy you'd see when you were going on the road?  Uncle Ted.  We just had Uncle Ted here last week.  He sold out nine shows.  Oh, that motherfucker.  Fucking Uncle Ted.  Because he's still bringing the rifle on stage for his closing bit.  Yes, he is.  Ah, that motherfucker. 
[02:56:00]  And he gets like slut applause breaks by saying things that the crowd has to clap to.  Yeah.  Like, you know, hey, USA, are we the best?  And people are like, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Ted.  This guy knows the joke.  Bill in South Carolina.  Go.  Does he?  My finger's on the dump button.  Uncle Ted came out on stage with an AR-15  and said Obama should suck on the end of it.  Oh.  Oh, is that what he did?  Yeah, he just said the same thing on Piers Morgan.  Okay.  Yeah.  And he said anybody that tries to take away his weaponry should suck on the end of it. 
[02:56:30]  That's a ballsy joke to do on stage.  Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Secret Service will say hello to you.  In front of Ted's crowd, I'm sure they really turned on him.  Yeah.  Here's the second part.  The whole point of your defense is that a lot of people do drop dead,  precisely because you are armed to the teeth.  Not true at all.  And you'd like everybody else to be.  Not true at all.  80 people.  Write this down.  See, you're so rich.  No, you write this down.  80 people a day die in America from gunshots.  And 75 of them to 78 of them, 
[02:57:00]  statistics by the Uniform Crime Report by the FBI  and the UN study on violent crime,  78 of those 80 are let out of their cages by corrupt judges and prosecutors  who know that recidivism is out of control,  know that they'll commit the crimes again,  and they let them walk through plea bargaining, early release, and program.  They still can't.  Kiss my ass.  Yeah.  Where you have the most armed citizens in America,  you have the lowest violent crime rate.  Absolutely true.  Where you have the worst gun control,  you have the highest crime rate. 
[02:57:30]  Very true.  Cheers.  Choose one.  Do you want a lot of crime?  We have it.  Gun-free zones.  Do you want less crime?  We have that.  More people with concealed weapons permit.  Why do you guys resist that statistic?  Well, they're you guys.  It's you guys.  Unless you're playing the devil's advocate.  I can play any advocate I like.  It's my show.  You're doing a fine job.  Right.  You're playing the idiot's advocate.  That's an asshole.  More guns equals less crime.  Period.  He just came back.  He's an informed guy.  He came back with a bunch of stats.  That guy could have, you know,  or unless you're playing devil's advocate, 
[02:58:00]  then he just switches it to like,  I can play whatever advocate I want.  That's not what he's fucking saying.  That's not what he's saying.  He just smashed Peter Morgan.  He just beat the shit out of him.  Yeah, yeah.  Ted Nugent is great when it comes to stats  because he knows what he's talking about.  He studies that shit.  And he's an ass, but he's right.  It's so fucking true.  I mean, look at the cities  where you're not even allowed to have guns.  They're the highest crime,  gun crime cities in the country.  And you're not even allowed to have them.  I was just in New Mexico  and somebody was saying  they lived in such a rural area  that the joke is 
[02:58:30]  the cops won't show up  unless there's a body.  So the joke up,  and people have just armed.  Oh, yeah.  And the joke out there is  shoot, shovel, and shut up.  And I was like,  I got to get the name of this town  because I think Anthony wants to buy  a summer home out there.  I certainly do.  I swear,  when I finally do retire  from the broadcasting industry  because it's, you know,  New York is kind of the,  you got to kind of be here. 
[02:59:00]  Right.  Um, I am moving to,  I think,  like either Arizona,  Texas,  somewhere where I can fucking...  I can't see you fitting in there, Anthony.  Are you really going to move?  I could get,  for what I paid for my house here,  I could have fucking hundreds of acres,  a palace,  fucking,  and just be able to go out  and shoot machine guns.  I could shoot machine guns.  I could shoot machine guns  instead of having to tiptoe  and walk on eggshells  to just fucking,  uh,  shoot a .22 at a range. 
[02:59:30]  What about, uh,  your family?  Well, you know,  it's kind of, you know,  it's a dense population here.  Population in Long Island,  New York City,  in Texas.  You still,  you couldn't just walk around.  I understand I can't walk out  and blast outside my yard.  I understand.  With your robe open  and your dick hanging out,  I know that's what you want to do.  But,  who wouldn't?  America!  America!  What about,  but it's like,  but what about the family?  You can't leave them behind.  Oh, please.  You would just start over somewhere?  He lives up in an airport,  of course he can.  There's airplanes. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah,  there's air,  there's aircraft.  I'll,  I'll make it home every so often.  Jesse James really got you thinking,  huh?  Oh, God.  You got Jesse James in here.  He's fucking great.  Yeah.  He could fucking,  you know,  he's got a shitload of land.  He's got fucking,  you know,  you got the freedoms to actually,  freedom to actually fucking own a firearm  without being,  uh,  uh,  made out like you're a lunatic.  No,  that is,  that is,  uh,  like,  I'm terrified of guns.  I didn't grow up around guns,  but I totally think you're,  you're,  you're an idiot if you're trying to get rid of that. 
[03:00:30]  And you're like,  it's just,  it's,  it's the stupidest argument ever that you will outlaw them and then they'll go away.  It's like,  no,  then only the government and,  and the bad guys will have guns.  Right.  Great idea.  Yeah.  I,  I 100% agree.  I don't agree with,  uh,  him saying that he's Lenny Bruce and that was a hacky.  no,  no,  that's stupid joke.  Not into that,  but his defending the,  uh,  the second amendment.  Yeah,  absolutely.  I was,  I was talking about the other day about,  um,  the,  the country and the,  the direction we're going in and how bad it's gotten with, 
[03:01:00]  um,  like the,  the,  I said,  the IRS sent me a letter.  They examined,  they don't audit anymore.  They examined my 2008,  uh,  return and said that I owed them upwards of,  you know,  $31,000.  So I'm like,  what the fuck is this?  So I send it off to my accountant and he's like,  Oh,  for some reason they didn't take out,  uh,  your,  your,  uh,  the deduction for the interest.  You paid on your home.  So I'm like,  Oh,  okay. 
[03:01:30]  We'll just send them.  That's in your favor.  Send them the statement and problem solved.  I just got a letter from them.  Just got a letter that said after,  and this is the part that got me after a careful examination of all of what you sent us,  please send us $31,000.  And then the reason behind it.  Now I'm trying to look for the reason.  I look for the reason.  It said,  could not read statement of mortgage.  They,  because they couldn't read it.  Get a lawyer.  You can get out of that.  Oh, 
[03:02:00]  believe me.  No,  I sent it back off to my accountant and he goes,  we'll send them a nice big clear copy.  But the fucked up thing was,  it said,  careful.  You just sell them those old people glasses.  I'll send them the whole thing.  Old people glasses.  Make the thing the size of one of those giant fucking checks that they give people that win.  Just fucking,  like,  like all that shit.  The thing that got me though,  was the balls to write that after carefully examining this,  we determined we couldn't read it.  So pay me,  motherfucker.  Well,  you didn't pay your share.  Oh, 
[03:02:30]  you cucksucker.  No,  that got me.  So that got me talking.  I'm surprised that they went after a guy at your level because you can afford counsel.  Like,  that's what I was,  that's a joke I was going to say.  You know,  after further examination,  how much,  what kind of a lawyer can this guy?  Yeah.  What kind of a lawyer can this guy muster up?  Huh?  But what,  what really got me and that got me talking about like,  uh,  and people always bring up both forefathers and what they intended and stuff.  And most of it's always bullshit.  Somebody just evokes the forefathers to make their point.  But when you think about the fact that there's no way now that the public can do anything against the government. 
[03:03:00]  And that was never the point.  The public was always supposed to have enough power that if the electoral process started getting corrupt or wasn't working,  that they could powerfully remove the government.  A certain,  a certain segment of the population.  Don't forget.  The population.  No,  no.  The American population was supposed to be able to forcibly remove the government if they got too much power. 
[03:03:30]  Yes.  No,  no,  no.  I'm saying the whole population didn't have that right.  Really?  No.  Blacks didn't have it.  Fucking women didn't have it.  No,  I wasn't talking about them.  They had no,  there weren't people back then.  There weren't fucking people.  That's what I'm kind of saying.  Whenever people invoke the forefathers,  you have to kind of look at their mindset at the time.  It's like people complain about corporations running everything now.  Well,  that's kind of what they were doing then.  That's a different,  they had,  they had a club built that they were the fucking bosses of and that they controlled everything. 
[03:04:00]  That's a whole different point.  to what you're saying.  No,  I know.  And an element of truth on Anthony's saying,  there were no free speech zones.  You could just talk.  You could gather up people.  If you had a protest,  they kind of,  but they did,  you know,  the riot act.  Yeah.  I remember reading about the riot act.  The riot act.  That means I can't talk publicly because I'm a riot.  You're a regular riot.  That was basically,  they,  what he's saying is basically,  it's been the same game.  It just keeps getting bigger and they're more in control of it. 
[03:04:30]  But we can't,  we've reached the point now of no return.  We can't as a population overthrow,  and it sounds horrible.  Overthrow the government.  No,  you can't.  There was a time in history where it could have been done if the government got corrupt,  got too much power,  started acting like the king in England and the reason they left.  And it's gotten to the point now where so many freedoms are taken away. 
[03:05:00]  If you even talk like that,  they will throw your ass in jail.  I also know,  I think it's the level of technology and the weaponry.  Dude,  I remember when I came in here and I was talking about that crap gun they're coming out with.  Can somebody please confirm that?  Because I always sound crazy when I bring this up.  I refuse to believe it.  But it was like this.  The brown note,  I think it is.  Yeah,  they shoot this.  I saw that on Mythbusters.  Is it true?  No,  I don't think it is.  Okay.  They did it on Mythbusters and they couldn't come up with a note that made him shit his pants.  No,  no,  no.  It wasn't. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah,  like they're saying it was some sort of ray.  A ray gun.  They shoot it at protesters.  Yes,  a ray gun.  We'll call it the Ronald ray gun.  Yes.  And then eventually,  like,  your want to overthrow the government is overpowered by your not wanting to suffer the humiliation of shitting yourself.  Of shitting yourself.  In public.  But you have no freedoms to really resist the government anymore.  They have every power to put on you whatever they want. 
[03:06:00]  You don't own your house.  You don't own your fucking property.  It's not Little House on the Prairie anymore.  You don't own your own fucking property.  Try not paying your,  pay your income tax.  Do all that.  Try not paying your property tax.  They will fucking kick you out of your house and you're done.  And you're fucking done.  Well, you know the whole thing is back in the day when you got a log cabin,  you didn't have a 30-year mortgage.  30 years is such a perfect thing because you get in right in your 30s at this point.  I was just looking at 30 years.  Look at that.  You get in there. 
[03:06:30]  It's right behind you.  It's the 30 years.  So by the time you finally pay this fucking thing off,  you're in your,  dude,  what the fuck?  Was that my gallbladder?  You're in those years.  You're not strong enough.  You're beaten down.  And then your insurance company drops you.  Now you have a pre-existing condition.  Now you got to take out a second loan.  And then you're fucking out.  You're out.  And they move another 30-year-old in.  And they just keep it going.  Keep it rolling.  Yeah, you don't own your house.  It's bullshit.  No, you don't.  I've been fucking trying to pay down my place.  My accountant told me I was out of my fucking mind.  Dude, no, I'm not.  Mine told me the same fucking thing. 
[03:07:00]  I paid mine off.  Fuck the accountants.  That's what I did.  Dump it to the principal.  Fuck the accountants.  Don't listen to them.  I understand.  I pay Elvis taxes rather than sitting there paying that fucking interest.  They're going to take it.  Absolutely.  I would definitely rather do that.  Because now, look, if I fucking get laid up and I fuck up my whatever and I can't work,  I don't have to worry about them taking.  Yes.  As long as you can pay your taxes.  I want to buy.  For the rest of your life.  I want to buy a house out in L.A. and I can't fucking do it.  I have the money, but I can't fucking. 
[03:07:30]  Because they're like, oh, yeah, you can take it out of that fund, but we're going to fucking  take like 40 percent.  Right.  And penalties.  And penalties.  It's like, can I get a loan against it?  And the whole reason why I put it on the crap table was because if I didn't put it  in there, they were going to take 25 percent of it.  So it's not really your money.  It is your money.  No.  Do what you want.  Oh, you mean the deferred tax money that you put away?  I'm just saying, like, why can't I just fucking make money and just leave it in a goddamn  bank without you fucking assholes taking all of it, you cunts?  All the time. 
[03:08:00]  Then they go, oh, yeah, go ahead.  Leave it in the bank and we're going to take this giant chunk out of it.  You're never going to get ahead.  Or you can stick it on the crap table.  Yeah.  They fucking waltz you in there.  Yeah.  You see the interest they give you?  That's a bank now and I.  I just yanked out.  Fuck.  I looked at my statement the other day.  I cannot believe it.  I yanked my money out of the bank.  I took a substantial.  I took about 80 percent of my money out of the bank.  There's no reason to leave your money in the bank.  You're not making anything off it anymore.  I took it all out of Bank of America.  It's pennies.  And I put it into like just mutual funds, like really safe investments, two, three percent,  something. 
[03:08:30]  Until the government collapses.  And we'd probably know this and maybe, well, any of us would probably know this, I guess,  but I'm going to go with that.  I was telling my wife, there was a time, didn't you used to get like 10 percent on your money  in the bank?  10, 14, 15 percent on your money in the bank.  Am I crazy for saying this?  People that had a million dollars were able to bank it and live off of a million dollars.  Am I crazy saying it was up to 10 percent?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  No, more than that.  It was more than 10 percent.  Yeah, you could get 14.  I didn't have money back then, but I sort of remember my dad and people talking about 
[03:09:00]  how they're getting 10 percent on their money in a bank.  I looked at my statement.  I don't even think we're getting less than a percent.  You get less than 1 percent, right?  The more money you had in, the better interest rate they gave it.  The better interest you got is fucked.  So it's like, why leave the money in the bank?  I might as well put it in a safe in my house.  You're losing that money.  Yeah, and people say don't do that because they go, well, you know, each account is insured  up to like $200,000.  Yeah, until it isn't.  Yeah.  Wow.  Until it isn't.  It's bullshit.  It's like all those fucking people down in New Orleans had flood insurance until the 
[03:09:30]  insurance company told them to go fuck themselves.  Right.  FDIC.  Dude, insurance is one of the biggest fucking scams.  I don't get insurance on anything.  That's another one.  My health insurance covers everything except what ails me.  Whenever I go in there.  Of course.  Of course.  Dude, my fucking health, I have dental, okay?  And just, if they have to fucking use, if they, if they, they just can only use the  scrapers.  If they use that electronic fucking thing.  Which makes it easier for you.  Yeah, the new technology.  Got a cavity?  They don't cover it.  Fuck you, pay me.  They don't.  You need root canal? 
[03:10:00]  Fuck you, pay me.  That's what it is.  They don't cover it.  And then they give me like $45 for a cleaning.  It's like, where am I going to go in getting a $45 cleaning?  So you have to sit there and get your teeth scraped just to try to save a few bucks.  No, I don't.  I don't.  I just say, fuck it.  Yeah, no, I know.  You use the best stuff.  Most people would just say, fuck it.  And they know that.  Yeah.  They know that.  I'm going to get all amped up here.  I just pulled the mic off.  But there are people that can't make that choice.  And they have to sit there and get their fucking teeth scraped because they don't want to pay  the extra.  Well, that's bullshit.  But the whole thing is a fuck.  It's like, it's almost like who's to blame at this point. 
[03:10:30]  Because it's like, you're right.  The insurance companies are fucking pigs.  But then again, if they're not pigs, they'll be overcharged for everything.  But then again, if the doctors don't overcharge for everything, their medical malpractice insurance.  Yeah, their malpractice insurance is horrible.  And people are greedy pigs and will fucking sue.  I'm going to tell you right now, Jimmy, there is plenty of money that we could all have.  The amount of fucking taxes we all play.  Those guys weren't such corrupt cunts stealing all of it.  Exactly.  Plenty of money.  We should have cards just like they do in England.  My fucking elbow hurts.  You slam your card down and you're fine. 
[03:11:00]  Just sit there and act like, that's going to cost zillions.  It's like, if you assholes weren't buying hammers for fucking $90 of fucking whack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know what you're saying, but that number's way up there.  It's all corrupt horseshit.  I don't mind if...  Oh, I'm on my stump over here.  I actually don't mind if they want to do stuff like that.  But don't put it all on my fucking back and on my tab.  Because I just happen to get lucky in life.  But now I'm the criminal.  I'm the guy that Obama, I'll say it, and the Democrats look at and say, oh boy, look at 
[03:11:30]  another rich guy.  We got to make sure he does his part.  I do my part every fucking three months, you cock.  You're the kind of rich guy they want to get.  They don't want to get those super rich guys that got an army of...  No, get me.  I'm prime.  You're standing there with your cash wearing one of those hospital aprons that doesn't cover  your ass.  Fucking rough, yes.  Just getting fucking up the ass.  Fucking, I'm a single white guy that did well, and I am the fucking, I am looked upon. 
[03:12:00]  If they could paint a picture of who they fucking want America to despise, it's me.  They don't want you to stop.  Thank you.  They're just trying to like, dude, we've been fighting two fucking wars, we're bankrupt.  Forever.  And they need cash.  They're shaking you down.  That's what that 31,000 is.  They're grabbing you by your ankles, they're tipping you upside down.  That's why they carefully examined a smudge on my fucking tax form.  But you can't let the people off the hook either, because the government is just made up 
[03:12:30]  of fucking us.  It's like...  No, you know what?  I realize it's not.  It used to be.  It's really not.  It's made up of a system.  No, there are people in it.  Are greedy.  The people are fucking...  Look at the way people have to litigate everything.  Right.  The way fucking parents complain.  They want rules in the school change because their kid is different.  People are self-centered fucking twats, and that's why the government is filled with  self-centered twats, because they come from us.  But the government isn't people anymore.  See, you can...  No, but I agree with what he's saying, because most people can't handle a position of power.  They are us.  They're a bunch of greedy cunts who have... 
[03:13:00]  That's shit.  That's like saying the fucking...  Schwarzenegger had the option to fucking do that, so he did it.  And then a bunch of people who don't have the option then can sit around and judge...  I don't think it's the same thing.  I wouldn't do that.  Here's what the government is.  It's like saying that a tilt-a-whirl ride are the people in the ride.  No.  It's the ride.  The government is the ride itself.  The politicians are in it, and they can't do fucking shit.  You want to shut down the ride now.  Let's see if we get somewhere.  Man, pull the plug. 
[03:13:30]  Where do you have to go?  You've got to pull the plug.  The banks.  The banks are the fucking power that rides the machine, man.  Ron Paul in 2012.  Now you know why you're getting audited, Anthony.  I'm not saying shit.  Believe me, no shit.  I know stuff I've said.  They're not going to be looking at my...  I know stuff I've said on this show has kept their nose in my fucking ass since 2000.  Join the movement.  They've had their nose in my fucking asshole. 
[03:14:00]  That's it.  Leave me alone.  I've actually...  I've just given in.  I just say fuck it.  Give up.  I got a good girl.  I got a dog.  Fuck it.  I don't give a shit.  You do.  American dream.  Yeah.  I don't need a house.  You don't need a house.  Really?  Is that how much you want?  Here, I'll throw another hundred bucks at you.  Does that make you happy, you cunt?  What if the price of housing continues to go down, though, Bill?  Oh, dude, they're just sucking you back into that shit.  To get you right back in.  Look how cheap slavery is, Bill.  They're pulling me right back in.  Hey.  Look how cheap the slavery is.  God, you have an answer for everything.  That would be great.  Logically, too, by the way. 
[03:14:30]  No, you don't go...  No, you go out and you buy a house where you can kick the shit out of the principal.  That's what you do.  You don't take fucking 30 years to pay the fucking thing off.  You're better off not to do it.  Should I be kicking the shit out of the principal at this point?  Yeah.  I just...  I do, of course.  Yeah.  You pay interest in these fucking scumbags?  I had to give the bank 6% interest?  Fuck them.  I mean, they loaned me the money.  They deserve something for that.  But they wanted 6...  10 years of interest only?  Absolutely not.  What if my portfolio is making 12%?  Well, that's what people's portfolio was until Bernie Madoff popped up and until the fucking 
[03:15:00]  market collapses.  What if you're very diversified?  I'm very diversified.  I'm making a...  That's the argument in favor...  I'm making a nice fucking...  Dude, that's the argument in favor of paying the interest.  So you pay 6% to the bank.  You make 11%.  So you're making 5% with a huge fucking risk.  That's why I was like, I'm dumping it into principal.  I dumped it into principal.  Take your mortgage payment and just multiply it times 12 and then times 30 and see what  you're really paying.  Oh, I know.  It's retarded.  Believe me, I look at it every month and you see what goes to principal.  It's staggering.  You end up... 
[03:15:30]  I was going to pay basically 210% of what my loan was.  I was going to end up paying back more than double of it.  So it was like 210% is what I was going to pay over the course of time.  So then you figure over the 30 years, how much does it fucking appreciate?  Not that much.  First of all, I'm down.  You're down right from the start.  Yeah.  I'm down.  Already over twice what the fuck I took out.  And then, oh my God, a pipe burst.  I got this tax.  I got that tax. 
[03:16:00]  All that bullshit.  I got the...  What do they call it?  The management fees or whatever I got to pay every month.  In the end, if you break even, you fucking killed the banks.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  You got condo fees, right?  Maintenance fees?  Yeah.  Maintenance fees.  Yeah.  Doesn't that drive you fucking insane?  Well, I understand that they have to...  To a point, but they're also...  No, this is what scares me.  They're also raping us.  This is what scares me, is I have a co-op and I paid it off.  So I think, all right.  You have a co-op.  And I'm like, I'm fine.  Oh, you could be...  I could make no money.  At least I got a roof over my head.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  No.  You have to get money coming in. 
[03:16:30]  No, basically, no.  I own shares.  I don't own that apartment.  I own, like, two shares in the building.  In the building.  And the way they pay me is they give me these two little rooms.  But if everybody else goes bankrupt and it goes in and only two shares are paid off,  the whole fucking thing goes back on the crap table and I got to start renting my place again or get the fuck out.  Wait, that's for a co-op or a condo too?  That's fucked.  So you got to hope everyone else stays in the game.  Bill can't sell it to whoever he wants. 
[03:17:00]  You can never stop running on the wheel.  No.  You got to keep running.  You can't sell it to whoever you want either, Bill.  They have to approve of who you sell it to.  It's a...  Well, that's the key, you know.  They created a fuck-or-be-fucked pyramid.  Yes.  It's when the guys at the top are fucking banging people and you're trying to pass it on.  Yeah, yeah.  And it goes all the way down and it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse.  So, like, that's what...  I'm sitting there looking at shit.  I want...  What's this?  If you started a $200,000 mortgage today, you would finally pay more principal than interest in your payment in November 2009. 
[03:17:30]  2029.  2029, you would start...  18 years?  You would start actually paying more principal than interest.  It would take until 2029.  Most people can't just dump a lot of principal in.  I was lucky out on the family, so I was able to.  But if you can, you're insane not to.  I don't buy the argument if it's a write-off because you have to spend it to write it off.  Why is it legal to front-end load all the interest?  I get the bank has to make money, but you just sit there and I'm...  Oh, they do.  They front-end load it.  And they pay nothing.  They pay no interest. 
[03:18:00]  It's terrible.  That's at 6%, yeah.  Jesus.  It's all front-end load.  At 6%, just to be fair.  So this is a $200,000 loan at 6%.  When you make that first month's payment, you only pay $200 in principal and you give the bank $1,000.  How do they...  How is that illegal?  It's legalized loan shark.  Usury.  Absolutely.  It's legalized usury.  But don't worry, guys.  The next month gets better because that was June and you paid $199 of principal.  In July, you get to pay $200 in principal and you only pay $999 in interest. 
[03:18:30]  So it's a buck.  Yeah, they want that money.  No, but it's great.  When you get from June, when you get to October, you actually pay $1.01.  One cent.  No, that's not bad.  More.  What's the penalty if you pay it off early?  Well, that's the thing.  Different mortgage companies.  It depends on your loan, right?  Yeah.  Some have prepayment penalties and some don't.  Amazing.  Imagine a prepayment penalty.  They look at you because they look at that thing and they say, okay, Jim took out this.  This is how much money we're going to make off of him.  And when you pay it off early, they'll look at it like we lost $80,000 on this guy the 
[03:19:00]  last time.  Yeah.  I don't like this guy.  He understands money.  Yeah, fuck this guy.  Oh, I fucking...  Let's give him a higher interest rate or something.  Yeah, we know he's just going to pay it off quick.  My credit cards hate me.  Fuck him.  I fucking...  I don't think I've paid credit card interest in six years.  Yeah, yeah.  You pay the whole thing.  Be careful on that.  This is what they do.  I don't care.  What do they do there?  No, no, no, no.  This is how they...  This is what they do.  You got to...  You sit there and you think if they go, okay, make this credit card payment by, you know,  May 15th.  You think you've sent it on the 14th. 
[03:19:30]  Fuck you.  I don't pay any interest.  That's not like...  A couple of my credit cards, how they do it is they send it to a processing center first.  They make it late.  They make it late.  And then if you don't pay attention, they're charging you fucking interest.  So what you got to do is when you get the bill, you send that motherfucker in early.  But then you run the risk of them, actually, there have been rumors, them talking about  possibly dumping people who do that.  Because then it becomes, well, we have to make our money.  Yeah, we're not making money off of you.  It's like, well, I pay my fee every year, 55 bucks for having it. 
[03:20:00]  We're just loaning you money for nothing.  No interest.  Because credit card interest compounds daily.  It's not like a monthly thing where every month it accrues.  Like every day you're getting charged credit card interest.  So even though you think you wrote that check to pay it off, you probably still owe a couple  of days' interest on it.  But I pay it in full every month when I can.  Well, yeah, no, that's a different thing.  That actually makes sense.  Two totally different things here.  And it was the wife of someone who figured that out.  I never even investigated it.  I just presented it as fact.  That's fucking ridiculous.  Somebody's told me something on a coffee cake. 
[03:20:30]  Uninformed is back.  What's great about my arguments is all you need is you need one or two questions fired  back at me and the whole thing falls down to the ground.  That really was funny.  Because you were very convincing, too.  You were like, dude, who told you that?  We were fucking at the diner.  That was some fucking...  And the waitress's friend came over.  Whatever.  And then Danny, who's got like fucking sliced the loan t-shirt on.  Hey, it's preacher, buddy.  Oh, sorry.  I'm just like...  I never opened my mouth about anything.  I said something about yesterday because I used to be in garbage. 
[03:21:00]  I used to be a garbage man.  And I said something today because I used to be a loan officer.  I promise I'll never say anything again.  I'm in garbage.  You used to be a loan officer.  Look at this.  Dude, they give those jobs to anybody.  That's why this country is in fucking the situation that we're in.  Because guys like me are fucking...  Are bilking you at closing costs.  And we want to...  Dude, you can afford it.  I want to...  Dude, believe me, I want to make you pay as much as I possibly can.  Because then I get...  That job when I was a loan officer, that was draw versus commission.  I didn't get paid unless I raped you.  How did they hire you?  Two very similar jobs, by the way.  They said, here, why don't we hire you? 
[03:21:30]  We don't have to pay you.  We'll teach you how to rape people.  And then that's where you get your money from.  I was going to say two very different jobs.  Then I realized it's two very similar jobs.  Garbage man and loan guy.  Just dealing with garbage all the time.  Producer of this show.  There you go.  A third job.  I'm still a garbage man.  This is still fucking just taking out the trash.  And it's wrapping up cords.  That means let's get the fuck out of here.  Bill Burr's going to come back tomorrow, though.  Absolutely, and I miss doing this show.  Yeah, yeah.  I fucking love talking about shit like this. 
[03:22:00]  Because over the years, have you noticed,  I've definitely changed my attitude on the banks,  the banking system, the government, and things like that.  I think I'm a little more in Bill's camp than I used to be.  Yeah, and I came more Jim Norton's way,  where I realized that, yeah,  everyone's just sort of a selfish piece of shit.  Selfish piece of shit.  Actually, that helped.  Rather than thinking that they were these shapeshifters.  You know what tells you?  What tells you?  Look at the fucking head of the International Monetary Fund.  Some fucking African immigrant who probably has AIDS, 
[03:22:30]  because you live in HIV housing,  he fucks her mouth, and everything's over.  Like, that's how fucking fast we're fucking,  and we've made this example before,  but in Watergate,  this fucking bullshit fucking rent-a-cop  sees a break-in,  and the presidency is ended.  The government is just torn down.  There's a weird checks and balances here  that a lot of societies don't have.  But the thing is,  you never get to those guys.  The big guys.  The guys behind the guys.  Hey!  Every time you go down to Washington,  it's always creepy,  because the person taking you to, like, 
[03:23:00]  the morning radio,  and you go,  wow, look at the Capitol.  Look at the White House.  And then they drive just by some just building.  Yeah.  Those are the people who fucking run everything.  Yeah, that's the fucking...  Those are the guys.  That's the building?  Yeah.  Those are all the lobbyists,  and you try to figure out  who the fucking lobbyists work for,  but it's all like...  That's the most powerful building,  but no one gets their picture in front of it?  Yeah, that whole theory of the illusion of choice.  What do you want?  This guy or this guy?  It's the same choice, basically.  That's where I'm at with that shit.  Yeah, I don't see the difference  between Democrats and Republicans.  I don't see a big difference.  There's not a single person 
[03:23:30]  that is responsible for anything.  Like, it's a consortium,  an organization of this.  So if you're like,  who made that up?  It's like,  well, this was voted on  by a consortium of...  That's the thing.  They let you vote for president,  but then major shit  that you really want to vote about,  they handled that.  Yeah, we'll take care of that shit.  We'll take care of that.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry, don't worry.  We got your best interest in hand.  Didn't fucking Leon Panetta,  though,  is that his name,  the CIA?  Yeah, yeah.  Those guys got fucking  dragged out through the mud  in front of Congress.  Once again, 
[03:24:00]  once again,  those guys are not...  They're the front men.  Yeah.  They're your front men.  But you can't be more of a decision maker  than the head of the CIA.  I mean,  him,  NSA,  I mean,  those guys are extraordinarily...  That's the way the Kennedys thought.  You can't get any higher  than the presidency.  Let's try to shut down that mob.  Blam.  Yes.  We'll take out through the kitchen.  Yeah,  that was a...  That was a job removal.  That was basically  what happened there.  Job removal.  Jesus.  Collect your things,  getting this convertible.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  The French guy, 
[03:24:30]  going back to Jimmy's thing,  he was told to fucking resign, man.  Yeah.  The guys above him said,  you know,  you're resigning today.  Yeah, dude,  they're not going to let you get  into a high level of power  unless you're on the right team.  Yeah.  I mean,  that even happens  at the lower levels  where, like,  unions would be like,  who the fuck is this guy?  Everybody get out there  and vote.  Like,  you just don't want...  You got to know  the guy that's going in there  is going to do the right thing.  Yeah.  Please don't ask  any follow-up questions. 
[03:25:00]  No.  I almost ran out of steam  on the guys  with the unions  and...  We're packing up.  Bill Burry-Carolines,  everybody.  Yes, Bill Burr.  Only one show left.  Sunday night,  10.30 show.  A few tickets available.  212-757-4100.  Jimmy.  Hilarious.  You good?  Two announcements.  My interview with Aziz Anzari  airs tomorrow  on Raw Dog  and I think 6 p.m. Eastern.  And there's a Jim Norton  weekend on the Boneyard.  They're replaying a bunch  of my shows  starting tomorrow,  also 6 p.m.  on the Boneyard here. 
[03:25:30]  Hey,  what do you do  on June 15th?  I'll be in Chicago  sitting between  Jim Brewer  and Bill Burr  giving them  each a hand release  while Dave Attell  services my meaty cock.  At the Chicago Theater.  Yes.  Also,  my latest video  of Jim Norton  jerking off  a fucking burrito  is up for your  viewing pleasure.  Very childish.  Oh, what is it?  A salty rap.  I like calling it  a burrito.  No!  It's very disturbing  to see what Jimmy  looks like jerking off,  but we capture  that moment for you. 
[03:26:00]  I enjoyed that video  more than I thought I would.  Everybody behave yourself.  Roland is here.  Yeah, watch out.  His eyes are still evil.  Yeah, Roland,  you're looking very handsome today.  I have no problems with that.  Are you turning back  to happy-go-lucky, Roland,  or are you still like,  I'm going to kill someone, Roland?  He really is a sycophant,  huh?  You've got the Springsteen  stuff on every day.  I really would not.  I wouldn't mess with you  on any level.  Yeah, he's crazy.  I want to talk about it.  I'm happy.  I want to talk about  Ant's driving video tomorrow.  You didn't really talk  about it today.  Oh, no.  Off air, you did.  Yeah, I'll make another one.  It's just one of those things. 
[03:26:30]  I'm testing out  these new cameras  because I'm doing  Pocono Speedway  Pocono stock car and shit.  So I checked out  this head cam and dash cam shit  that I'm going to do  to get some good video of it.  You should do a show  on that.  You should do it.  You should do a TV show  on that Speed Channel.  You've seen that new show  that Pink's whatever,  that drag race?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Racing for Pink's.  Yeah, that guy, Willie B.  I used to do radio  with him out in Denver.  I don't know if he's still out there.  Great fucking guy.  Oh, he's doing that? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, he got that gig, yeah.  It's awesome, man.  It's a great gig, huh?  Because I wish I knew  how to fix cars.  All right.  We should have quit  a minute ago.  It's kind of petering out.  Everybody's stood up.  I have my jacket on.  Yeah, we're all ready  to go.  I've got my bag of my hand.  My headphones are off.  Am I even on the air anymore?  Who knows?  Take it easy.  All right, time to turn  off the channel.  Go somewhere else  for an hour  until we're on a Fez.  We're on.  Is Fezzy going  into the nut house?  What's the rumor there?  I don't know.  Ant's actually leaving  as I asked this.  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm curious.  A lot of people  talking about Fez. 
[03:27:30]  What's going on?  We'll talk about it  in the next hour.  No, stop, Sam.  What do you know?  I have no idea.  Is there someone  just starting a rumor  that Fez might end up  in a nut house?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's coming in a lot,  so what's going on?  Is it the same guy?  Talk about it  during the shit hour  so I can hear it  on my way home.  Okay.  Maybe when Ronnie  does part of that show  with you today.  I'll ask him about it.  Yeah, because people  are fucking writing it  like crazy.  Is it different people?  Yeah.  That's weird.  Everybody's gone.  What happened? 
[03:28:00]  Everybody left.  It's not my hour yet.  We haven't got a commercial.  I mean, I know  what time it is,  but we would have  to go to commercial.  You only took  two breaks today.  You're writing.  What's the writing?  I'm not here.  Well, yes, you are.  I don't even have control  over the board or anything.  You're still there.  You're writing.  I can hear it. 
[03:28:30]  This is not my show.  It's still Opie and Anthony  material, by the way, folks.  I'm not responsible  for what you're hearing yet.  I refuse to be.  What does that say?  If you don't hear me,  I'm not here.  I guess those are  the rules of radio,  just being an audible medium.  How does the energy  leave a room so quickly?  You had Bill Burr  and Jim Norton  and Anthony.  Then all of a sudden  everybody clears out  and there's nobody left.  It's just me  and I thought 
[03:29:00]  Opie was here  but apparently  he's not.  Can you hear that  marker moving at home?  That's Opie writing.  So now you're  talking to yourself.  No, I'm not.  I'm talking to the listeners.  I'm like Rush Limbaugh.  I'm just a man  sitting alone in a room  talking to his listeners.  We're having a conversation,  all of us together.  You in the car.  You sitting in your living room.  You laying in bed  thinking,  I don't want to get up.  I'm talking to you too.  All of us  having a conversation together. 
[03:29:30]  Who's that?  Roland,  this isn't my show yet  technically.  Stop making believe  I'm here.  Alright.  I didn't read that.  Opie's not here.  So who are you  if Opie's not here?  Roland,  somebody's got to send this  to break  because I can't start my show  until this goes to break.  Opie's not here.  He's right there.  He's writing.  No, he's not.  He just stopped talking  and started writing.  That's not the way it works. 
[03:30:00]  That's not him.  Who is it?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Can I throw it to break  or no?  Because it's up to you.  It's your call.  Go.  Because it's still your show  and we're way behind  on breaks, right, Travis?  He's just going to nod.  Oh, that's the only way  you just wrote.  I'm Sam  and I'm not going to say  the rest of it.  I like kissing, man.  Nah, you like kissing, man.  You got that?  You can isolate that.  Son of a bitch.  Son of a bitch.  That's why you don't say  those things, Roland. 
[03:30:30]  Gotcha.  Goddamn.  Rape you with a rake.  Rape you with a rake.  Yeah, this is really starting  to cut into some of my time.  We're going to go over  some of the stuff  that happened on the show.  There's some bits  I'm running out of course.  He can cut in.  I know.  Because, I mean,  you've got to throw it to break  or end your show.  And he has to play  the three minutes of Rogan's.  It's like 15 minutes.  Oh.  I've got to play  a Joe Rogan clip.  He's coming to the channel.  I mean, 
[03:31:00]  I'm probably going to have  to take a break  during,  after Opie and Anthony live.  Because, yeah,  because there was only  three Opie and Anthony segments.  I'm not drinking that water.  That's Opie.  That's how you know  he's still here.  Roland's not drinking either.  That one.  Okay, you just,  that was you burping, Opie.  That time,  that was pretty much talking.  Burping is very close  to talking. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, you're scratching  your balls.  I have to use that mic.  It's way too close  to your testicles.  I mean,  out of respect,  I would say don't,  don't throw the break.  At least until Opie's leaving.  Now he's putting on his coat.  It's the Opie and Anthony show,  by the way.  It's not,  see, you can hear,  people can hear you  moving the bag.  They know you're still here.  You hear the zipper  of your camera case.  All right,  you took the headphones off. 
[03:32:00]  They just heard you  put the headphones down.  That was audible.  They can hear your bag.  It's a loud paper bag.  You're not even  going to say goodbye?  He's walking out.  Roland's following him.  Obviously,  he's got to pitch  some guests.  I'm telling you,  he's walking out.  See,  you could tell  he just walked out  because he slammed the door.  I guess I've really  taken over  the Opie and Anthony show  at this point.  But,  I'm going to do 
[03:32:30]  the responsible thing  as a good broadcaster  and tell you,  I hope you've enjoyed  today's  Opie and Anthony show.  Stay tuned  because after  Opie and Anthony live,  well,  Danny's showing his butt  in the other room.  That doesn't help either.  Again,  it's not a visual medium  we're on  and nobody else  except for me  and Travis  who's sitting right next to you  pretending not to like it  can see your butt.  Stay tuned.  After Opie and Anthony live  starts,  because it hasn't started,  starts  after this.  The Opie and Anthony show
