<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and self-deprecating commentary on their own controversial radio persona.  They then recounted Anthony's bizarre social experiment: hiding $20 under a park bench and tweeting its location, leading to a hungover individual finding it.  The show extensively covered the hosts' weekend activities: Opie's "white trash weekend," involving photographing teenage girls in a diner and subsequent Twitter interactions, and Anthony's experience at an Allman Brothers Band concert, including backstage encounters with Butch Trucks amidst heavy marijuana smoke. Anthony also discussed watching *Band of Brothers* and a *Futurama* episode featuring a grieving dog, sparking a tangent on dogs' surprising multilingual abilities.

A significant portion detailed the ongoing prank involving intern Davidâ€™s repeated intrusions onto the Ron & Fez show, despite Ron Bennington's vehement dislike. This escalated to increasingly absurd confrontations, culminating in a peace offering (veggie sub, cigar, and megaphone) that ended with the sandwich smeared on David's face and a near-physical altercation.  Audio clips were played.  The show also touched upon the Obama administration's reaction to a perceived insensitive joke, leading to sarcastic commentary on public outrage and political correctness.  This segued into a discussion about bowling, prompted by the Obama joke, featuring Stephen Lynch's "Let me bowl and let me die" song, which the hosts played and mocked, followed by a discussion of various bowling styles and listener calls detailing their own bowling experiences and other sports they deemed worse.  One caller recounted working at a Chicago pizza place whose owner drove a DeLorean.  The discussion then transitioned to video games, including controversial titles like *Death Race*, *Mortal Kombat*, *Doom*, *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*, *Manhunt 2*, and others, along with detailed discussion of one host's high score in *Brick Breaker*.  The hosts and callers debated game violence and the Wii's capabilities.  A comedic moment arose from a caller's hyperactive response after mentioning marijuana use.  A video of Alec Baldwin playing a Wii game was shown.  The discussion included rumors about celebrities, including Obama's mole, Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart, Bruce Willis, and high school cheerleaders, along with tangents about *Gossip Girl*, *90210*, and college basketball.


The show continued with a lengthy discussion of television shows, initiated by Sam's enthusiasm for "Secret Life of the American Teen,"  featuring highly offensive language and commentary on various shows, including *Gossip Girl*, *The Wire*, *Tool Academy*, *Tough Love*, *He's Just Not That Into You*, *90210*, *Band of Brothers*, *Hell's Kitchen*, *Kitchen Nightmares*, *Ace of Cakes*, *John and Kate Plus 8*, *Operation Repo*, *Cheaters*, *Man vs. Food*, *Locked Up Abroad*, *Degrassi: The Next Generation*, *Survivor Man*, *Nip/Tuck*, *Monster Quest*, *The Exterminators*, and *Ice Road Truckers*.  A caller revealed that *Operation Repo* uses recreated scenes.  The discussion included a fight between DJs at a Des Moines sports radio station and the hosts' move to a new studio. Brendan, a caller, and Ted (an ice cream cake business owner) participated. A studio audience member gifted Opie a piece of handmade flatulence-themed art, leading to further crude conversation.


The show then featured Liz as a guest.  The conversation, marked by sexually suggestive humor, covered Liz's past (dropping out of school for unsatisfactory hotel management in Vegas), her unusual attire (described as a jumpsuit/parachute pants combination worn as a dress), Roberto Alomar shoes, her boyfriend Skylar Penny, her antidepressant use (possibly Lexapro), and her recent nude modeling for art classes (resulting in a fainting incident). A sketch artist attempted to draw her nude, prompting discussion about posing and nudity.  The hosts made numerous jokes about her appearance and personality, often calling her "crazy" or "nutty." Liz danced and sang, with the hosts commenting on her moves.  Technical difficulties with a wireless microphone briefly occurred.


The final segment with Liz continued with humorous exchanges about vitamin D deficiency, quickly shifting to Liz's sexual preferences (describing herself as submissive and enjoying spanking), prompting further ribald jokes. The hosts jokingly attempted to help listeners find her Facebook profile through vague descriptions. They concluded with a hypothetical discussion about whom they would kill, including an audience member named Kenny, before saying goodbye to Liz and ending the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shotshocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shotshocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shotshocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shotshocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shotshocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shotshocks, Opie and Anthony.  What would I sacrifice in a chimp attack so the family gets 50 mil?  50 mil for a chimp attack.  50 million? I'd put on a chimp outfit and bite my mother's face off.  I was lucky enough to be an Istanbul.  It's 90-something percent Muslim, but it was a good guy.  I mean, every once in a while you would see one and they would point out, that's a radical Muslim. 
[00:01:00]  They were pretty regular.  Holding a head in his hand.  This is what's left of a Pennsylvania dog kennel after a propane tank ignited, setting the pens on fire.  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah.  This thing we call the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Damn mic dangling in front of my face.  This stupid microphone.  Oh, don't worry about it.  Mars looks all panicky like there's something wrong with it.  No, I'm just physically.  Yeah.  This phallic thing that's in front of my face five days a week.  I just, Monday morning can look forward to this big knobby fucking cock in front of my face every weekday morning. 
[00:02:00]  What the fuck do you want us to say into these things today?  For your pleasure.  Yes, for your pleasure.  Yeah.  But, uh, man, morning.  Morning to everybody.  So were you creeped out by my Robin Hood thing?  Because when you walked in, you go, morning, Robin Hood.  Yeah, Robin Hood.  Over here, what are you helping out the downtrodden?  I don't know.  I just had this idea and I decided to go with it.  This stupid Twitter thing. 
[00:02:30]  A little twist on the Twitter thing.  A little interactivity.  Yeah.  With, uh, Twitter.  Well, in broad daylight, in a very populated area, just in case.  Sure.  Because, I mean, some of these people that, uh, follow you or listen to this show.  Uh.  Uh.  Creeps and ghouls.  Some.  Some.  I just decided that, uh, you know, uh, I needed to hide $20 yesterday as an experiment. 
[00:03:00]  Wish I knew you were doing it.  I would have taken it.  I'd be like, and here's our, oh, Jesus, it's Anthony.  Someone was hoping, because it was, uh, sort of in the neighborhood that, uh, they were  hoping that Jimmy would have been the one.  Yeah.  The winner.  You didn't hear what I did?  No.  Uh, it's kind of creepy, to be honest with you.  I decided that I would, uh, uh, I would tweet, there's the guy who, uh, I'll explain everything 
[00:03:30]  in a second.  Is that?  I know what that is, too, because I recognize the story on the back.  Yeah, well, of course.  That's how I took the picture, so you could figure out where it was.  Oh.  So, that's the winner of my little, uh, Twitter contest.  What Twitter contest?  I have Twitter, and I have, no, I don't, I don't really read other Twits.  Hold on.  No, it's all right.  This is.  You're a selfish Twitter.  No, no, I just don't think of it.  You are a selfish Twitter.  You gotta read.  You're selfish.  I don't think of it.  You gotta read some of the people you're following.  That's the whole key to this.  Oh, I only Twitter.  I only tweeted once yesterday.  Tweet! 
[00:04:00]  Tweet!  Look.  I hate tweeted.  There's the first picture.  So, basically, I was bored yesterday, so I said, you know, I'm gonna try a little social  experiment.  So, I took $20, and I openly said, look, I'm starting out small.  If this works, maybe I'll get a little crazy with this thing.  Not saying that, uh, you know, $20 was the end game here.  Go, 25 bucks.  I might go 25, yes.  Maybe throw a little change there.  A couple of bills.  Right.  So, Jimmy, what you're looking at is a picture that I sent out yesterday to my followers. 
[00:04:30]  I said, you see this spot, and of course you see a bench in the middle of Broadway.  I said, I'm gonna hide $20 under that, uh, bench.  And I did just that, which I felt creepy about, because now I'm sitting on the bench, and I'm  trying to tape it under the, under the bench, without anyone, like, uh...  It's like microfilm with the CIA or something?  And then, when you do something like that, you're convinced that just everyone's looking  at you, you get so effing paranoid.  But no one is.  No one, right? 
[00:05:00]  There was a cop car that went by.  I, I, I felt so guilty.  I'm like, what are you doing?  You're just, you're just taping $20 under a dumb bench.  Relax.  Just relax.  Breathe.  Yeah.  And then I started, uh, then I started feeling like a creep that I'm even doing this.  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  All right.  I'm having this conversation with myself.  So then, Jimmy, I put the $20 under there, and then I told my followers that, uh, the first  person to go to this location, and they got the picture sent to them, uh, there's $20  waiting for them under the bench. 
[00:05:30]  So then I walked away, because I had things to do, and then I decided, well, if someone's  going to get the $20, absolutely, but if I walk away, no one's going to believe that  this actually worked.  So then I decided to sit across the street like a creep and watch the bench.  Yeah.  Like I was some kind of spy.  Yeah, that's, that was my seat.  And there's, uh, what you're looking at now, Jimmy, is the guy who showed up to claim  the $20.  Where?  Oh, he's bent over. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, he's kind of bent over.  Okay.  He's bent over.  You can see it.  Yeah.  I couldn't see it on my little phone.  And that's me taking the picture of where I was sitting.  So then I'm like, ooh, we got a winner.  Let's go see who it is.  That's what I did with my time yesterday.  It's my $20 now.  And then I...  Some creepy guy gets all mad.  Leave me alone.  I want anonymity.  And then I walked over, and I believe his name is, uh, C Foley 5446 on Twitter.  Wow.  And there you go. 
[00:06:30]  That was the guy that found the $20.  I'm actually going back over my old, uh, those were probably done while I was still in bed.  And I think it was yesterday afternoon.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah, it was early afternoon, I think.  And, uh, 2.18 p.m. was when you finally put C Foley up.  Yeah.  C Foley.  Yeah, there you go.  And there he is.  He said, ah, dude, I'm really hungover.  But this $20 will pay for another month of XM.  Thanks.  And then he ran away, and I ran away, and that was it.  He looks really hungover.  He does, right?  He can burn open his eyes.  Yeah.  So my little social experiment worked. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  It was fun.  I'll do it again with, uh, maybe a little, a little higher denomination.  Rub it on your, uh, crack.  Huh?  Rub it on your crack.  And get a good laugh.  Actually, I got a couple ideas.  I don't want to.  There's one really good idea, but I don't want to say it on the air, because it's similar  to that.  How about one of the rat holes in fucking that little park by, uh, is that this 500 to rat  hole?  Oh, creepy.  Yeah.  Maybe the first person that clubs a rat and throws it at my feet as I'm watching you from 
[00:07:30]  a distance.  When I made eye contact with that guy, I was, like, creeped out.  I'm like, ugh, yeah, I know.  It's me.  I'm a loser.  I'm just hanging out doing this.  Tweeting.  Tweeting.  So, here we go.  Well, OP Radio on Twitter, but I had a little fun with my, uh, my, my little, my little,  uh, Twitter over the weekend.  How was your weekend there, eh?  Well, I, um, I kind of, kind of had a white trash weekend. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah?  Which is nice.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  I wasn't going to say it's a bad thing.  And I was tweeting.  I tweeted, um, from, uh, one of, uh, Long Island diners.  Right.  Um, and, uh, then I tried to get, cause there were these three annoying, uh, uh, teen girls  at the next booth.  And they were playing the stupid jukeboxes that are on the side of the diner things in  the booths.  Most of those don't work anymore.  I know.  You found a diner where they work.  This one worked and they were singing some journey song. 
[00:08:30]  I think it's Don't Stop Believin'.  Of course.  And, uh, so I decided I was going to try to, um, anonymously kind of hold my camera  up and snap a picture of them.  Yeah.  And I think they caught me.  Yeah.  And they just ducked down cause creepy guy was taking pictures of them.  I was like, so then I had to acknowledge it.  I said, okay, what Twitter caption do you want?  I was thinking annoying diner girls.  And they're like, oh my God.  Laughing.  Oh, wait, you talked to them? 
[00:09:00]  Two seconds.  After you took the picture and got caught.  I got you.  Yeah.  Cause I got, you know, I got caught, but I posted that up there and then, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it right there.  Wait, I've been to that diner.  The one on the right was, uh, she caught me, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, um, then went to a bar up there in Glen Cove, uh, ate and, and sang some karaoke.  Nice.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And Gini showed up.  I did. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  That was fun.  For some karaoke?  I didn't sing.  Well, no.  He just hung out.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Did you invite Jimmy, but not me?  No, Jimmy.  Am I going to be sad now?  No, actually it was, I'll tell you how I, cause I'm very needy these days.  No, I actually, I actually found, I actually found out from a third party who's, uh, let's  just say was having a certain event.  Yeah.  Uh, and, uh, mentioned it to me and said, Hey, if you want to come, come.  Very good.  And, um, no one was more surprised to see me than Dumbbell while he was singing and I  walked in.  I know.  Cause he was belting out a love song.  I'm like, Ooh, it's Jimmy. 
[00:10:00]  What love song?  I don't even remember.  What was it?  I don't remember either.  I just know it was sappy and slow.  Billy Joel drivel.  Oh, really?  Either that or.  A little Captain Jack will get you high tonight.  Yeah.  Something.  It actually might've been, I love you just the way you are.  I don't want to swear to it.  It was something.  I went deep.  It was something.  Ba, ba, ba, ba.  Like one of those.  Yeah.  Do a little just the way you are.  A little bit of everything.  You know, I could rock.  I could ballad.  Yeah.  That's just me.  What is it? 
[00:10:30]  Every rock.  What was the big?  I need the screen with the words.  No, every rock.  Oh, every soft side.  Every rocker has his soft side.  Yeah.  Okay.  I was going to say rock god or something.  That was the ballads disc.  Did that.  And then the good old History Channel was playing Band of Brothers.  Oh, nice.  So I was watching that and then I was just getting annoyed by the language not being used in the commercial breaks.  So I turned that off and grabbed the box set. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, of course.  And threw that in and just did a festival of Band of Brothers.  It was a Band of Brothers weekend in between.  Yeah.  In between other stuff.  Just can't get enough of that series.  It's so.  I noticed it's so rewatchable.  Like that's one of those series that you could get on DVD and it's not like you just watch it and then it goes away and just you never see it again.  Yeah.  Like every year or so you could pull that thing out and pop it in.  And it's fantastic to watch. 
[00:11:30]  So, yeah.  That's one of those shows I watched maybe two or whatever, two or three episodes.  Loved it.  Yeah.  And that's it.  Yeah.  But that's it.  Like I should just be all in.  And for whatever reason, I'm just not.  And I loved what I saw.  Each episode stands on its own, which is good.  Which makes it a little easier.  But then you watch the whole thing.  You get the whole story of the guys and everything.  And then you can really get into how fucked up it got when, you know, these guys went through so much, Normandy and everything. 
[00:12:00]  And then some of them just get killed.  Right.  Because it's not Hollywood.  Right.  It's not like some of the main characters.  You don't end up getting killed or their legs blown off and crap like that.  And you're just like, oh, God.  Ben and Broders.  Yeah.  Good one, though.  I caught up on some TV.  I watched, because everyone suggested it, the South Park, the coon.  Yes.  The kin.  The kin.  Trey and Matt.  Matt and Trey. 
[00:12:30]  My God.  That, not only is that a great episode of South Park where Cartman plays this superhero called the coon.  And what was the other one?  The Mysterio.  Mysterion.  Mysterion.  No, I knew it was, yeah.  I was going to say Mysterio, but obviously.  Yeah.  Mysterion.  But what was great about that episode, it's just so well written.  Yeah.  So well written.  And they just really captured that whole superhero vibe and a city in decay.  Yeah.  And the lines were just really, really funny. 
[00:13:00]  And the superhero voice.  You know, there were two shows I watched over the weekend, Boltz doing the Christian Bale Batman voice.  Oh, really?  And I'm telling you, man, I really think Jimmy started that.  Yeah.  I really do.  So, I mean, it turned out to be an obvious thing, but Jimmy was all over that from day one.  Yeah.  And 30 Rock referenced it.  And also this episode of the coon.  I mean, South Park was basically, Cartman was basically talking about Christian Bale the entire episode.  We saw it before it came out. 
[00:13:30]  We got a sneak preview with the IMAX.  Yeah.  So it was before it was out.  Really ruined it for me.  Yeah, ruined it for everybody after you got through with it.  That was the most satisfying thing of the year was people going, they couldn't think of anything else other than me making fun of this dumb voice.  Yeah.  I was so happy.  But damn, is that, that coon episode of South Park was well, well done.  Kent the Movie Guy is asking you, did you hear about the Band of Brothers sequel?  Yes, I did. 
[00:14:00]  I heard, though, it's not truly a sequel or anything.  It's just the Pacific Theater version of World War II and, you know, the guys.  And the lead character in that, the lead kind of guy, one of them, you know, it's an ensemble cast, is the little kid from Jurassic Park.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He's all grown up.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, I saw it, and I was like, this kid looks familiar.  Who the hell is that? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Went to IMDb, and I was like, yep.  I might have to commit to Band of Brothers and watch the whole darn thing, though.  It really is just fantastic watching it.  And then again, watching the old soldiers talking about, you know, lost a lot of good men up there.  Yeah.  A lot of them were my friends.  Like, oh, look at the old guy crying.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  And then I finally saw the Futurama episode with the dog. 
[00:15:00]  CokeLogic asking if I got a little teary-eyed.  Ah, I was in a blubbering mess like everybody said I would be.  No.  No.  Yeah, I didn't.  Where time keeps passing.  And the dog is waiting for me, and the dog is waiting for its owner to come back, and of course the owner never comes back.  I just thought it was funny.  It was good.  It was whatever.  It wasn't sad.  It was all right.  I threw it at E-Rock.  I go, hey, I didn't cry.  Here's your Futurama DVD bag. 
[00:15:30]  Your DVD baby.  Cry baby.  Get a hold of yourself.  No, it was a pretty good episode, but.  And it's supposedly based on a true story of some owner leaving the dog behind, and the dog not smart enough to figure it out.  How many times has that happened?  Oh, wait a minute.  It might be based on that Japanese dog.  Yes, exactly.  That's exactly.  At a train station.  Really?  Tough dog?  No, a Japanese professor had a dog, and he had it for a year or two, and then he died. 
[00:16:00]  So the dog, for 10 years or 12 years after, would run to the train station every time, every day, at the same time, to meet his owner, who never came back.  And the people died.  He was a stupid dog.  He was in English.  They were all in Japanese.  I'm going to die.  I didn't even know what to say.  And they built a memorial to him or something, the dog, and then it got destroyed.  During World War II, and they rebuilt.  Some weird shit, but the people really noticed this.  There's a stop.  It's named after him now.  That's a dumb dog.  You ever wonder why a dog could learn a foreign language, but we can't? 
[00:16:30]  That always creeps me out.  Oh, when they say, like, you know, come here, boy.  In New York, you know, there's people from all over the world.  So you see someone walking their dog, and they're talking to it in, like, a foreign language.  I'm like, well, why can't I just pick up that foreign language?  A stupid dog understands a little bit.  The dog got Rosette's stone.  Right.  Because you just think dogs can.  Because, you know, we're so self-centered as Americans, you just assume that dogs only  know English.  Yeah.  But people have dogs all over the world, and they talk the, you know, the hometown language 
[00:17:00]  of the dog.  Dogs speak English.  And that's it.  So if you see some dog being spoke to in, like, French or whatever, you're like, wow,  that's got to be a really smart dog.  We're important.  It's only supposed to know English.  Yes.  It's got a second language.  I saw, really fast, because we're talking about our weekends here, I went and saw the  Allman Brothers.  Holy.  Are you an Allman Brothers fan?  I'm not.  I would assume you're not.  I know Anthony is a bit. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  I'm not, like, crazy Allman Brothers fan.  I like, they've had a multitude of hits over the years.  What's one of the big songs?  I know this stuff, but what's the big song?  Oh, my God.  Ramblin' Man.  Okay, yeah, I like that.  Jessica, Sweet Melissa, Blue Sky, Statesboro Blues.  Yeah.  Because they, you know, I'm not a blues guy at all.  Really?  So it's a little too bluesy for me, but they kind of mix it up with some catchy stuff in  there.  I like their percussion more than anything. 
[00:18:00]  Their percussion is just amazing.  There you go.  Now, this song, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, come on.  But I don't.  I mean, they're playing the Beacon Theater here in New York for a month straight.  Every day except, I think, Sunday.  I think they take Sundays off.  And I went on Saturday, three and a half hour show.  I don't think, we left a little early.  I don't think they played Ramblin' Man.  Did they close with it?  I don't know.  I left a little early.  But it was.  It was with a 30-minute jam.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  But I think I'm officially back in as far as pot goes because Steve Leeds from  Sirius got me tickets.  Thank you to Steve.  And we got to sit on the stage.  But before we were allowed on the stage to kind of sit and hang out and watch the Allman  Brothers, they brought us into this room deep into the belly of the beacon somewhere.  It was a cool, loungy area.  There was so much pot being smoked that I think officially I'm smoking pot again. 
[00:19:00]  Really?  I didn't take any toques or nothing.  But it felt a little woozy.  I was a little woozy.  It was definitely a cloud of pot smoke, man.  Yeah.  Probably a light contact high.  You think?  A little bit, yeah.  I must have.  There was so much.  I mean.  It's in the air and you're breathing.  There wasn't a beer to be had.  I don't know what that's about.  Maybe Greg Allman's not drinking and so they want to make sure it's dry backstage because  there was nothing.  But everyone was smoking.  Not everyone, but a lot of pot smoke in the air. 
[00:19:30]  Did you see any of the band members around?  Yeah.  I talked to Butch Trucks.  One of the original members.  Three original members left.  Out of how many?  I don't know.  Like six.  Probably like seven or eight originally.  It was a big band.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, there was a bunch of people in that band over the years.  It was a big band.  Didn't Sherry, wasn't she married to Greg Allman?  Yeah, they did a little something.  They did.  I don't know if they, they had a kid together, Elijah Blue Allman. 
[00:20:00]  Homo?  Well, he dresses like a girl and stuff.  He dresses like his mom.  Yeah.  I think he went a little mo.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He used to have like the long hair like his pops, but now you see him and you're like,  wow, that's the same kid, huh?  What's going on there?  It was in the video when she had her ass hanging out.  That's right.  He was playing guitar, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And Cher was coming like too close to him and showing her ass to him and it was really 
[00:20:30]  creepy.  Amazing.  But what was I going to say?  Oh, I just want to mention, and this is, I swear to you, this isn't a plugola, a payola,  nothing.  I got my tickets from Steve Leeds, but I met a lot of people backstage and the Allman Brothers  are doing something that is just amazing.  There's a website called Moogus.com where you can see all the Allman Brothers shows at the  Beacon Theater.  I mentioned this.  I was telling Ann, it's a nine-camera shoot and you pay some kind of like subscription  for the month and you get to see all the shows. 
[00:21:00]  You get to see all those shows and a bunch of shows they've already done the last year  or two, all archived.  And it's like, I told Ann, it's like an HBO production, how unbelievable it is and how great  it sounds.  I mean, they're like focused right in on the guys as they're jamming on their fingers  and just sick.  Are they that popular?  I guess they are.  Yeah, the Allman Brothers have never really gotten away.  They're kind of like doing that jam band thing now.  I mean, they got younger guys that really know how to jam and they just keep on doing it. 
[00:21:30]  They've always had that kind of almost Grateful Dead-ish following thing.  Yeah, absolutely.  Where people will just always, yeah, they're playing 20 nights, I got tickets for every night.  And every show is way different than the one before.  All right.  Like Eric Clapton played on Friday night.  I couldn't get tickets to that one.  I was lucky enough to get the Asbury Dukes.  Did you know he was going to be there?  The Jukes.  Or the Jukes, whatever, yeah.  I don't even know if Southside was there.  I don't even know if he was there.  Southside Johnny? 
[00:22:00]  I think he was there, but he wasn't really singing.  But Southside Johnny was there, Asbury, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Did you know Clapton was going to be there?  Oh, yeah, I tried.  You know how good your connections are when you really want something.  And my connections suck.  I'm like, I want to go see the Allman Brothers with Eric Clapton on Friday.  Yeah, right.  Him and Steve, this is how much Clapton, my manager, wants to see him in L.A.  He's playing with Steve Winwood, who I don't know anything about Steve Winwood.  Yeah. 
[00:22:30]  They're playing some massive gig, and it's $300 and something dollars a ticket.  I mean, it's fucking amazing how much money this guy has.  Clapton is a god.  I got to see, like I said, Southside and the Asbury Dukes, and then Bruce Hornsby was  on the keyboard.  Bruce Hornsby.  And people go, Bruce Hornsby and the Range?  Yeah, they're like, the way it is guy in Mandolin Range?  Yeah, that guy.  But he ended up playing with the dead for a while, and he has a whole different vibe  than his hit songs.  Like, he's kind of a hippie dude that hangs out with those guys and fits in very well. 
[00:23:00]  Although he looks like a serial killer.  Like, Hollywood should put him in a role of a murderer.  He is a creep.  Really?  He looks creepy.  He's a tall dude, lanky, uncomfortable in his skin, has some kind of, like, sort of comb  over going on.  Hornsby?  Oh, yeah.  He's creepy, and he's got this, like, this weird smile, psycho, psycho smile going on. 
[00:23:30]  So, but I mean, very cool, this Moogus.com and how you can check out the shows if you  don't get a ticket.  Did you watch Clapton on?  No, not yet.  I started watching it last night, and then I got tired, because he doesn't come out on  stage right away.  He's a little later on as a guest performer.  So, I'm going to check that out tonight.  And then I asked a bunch of people if the Allman Brothers is the first to do this, and  not really.  There's another website, I forgot the name, where bands are putting their stuff up on now,  and you can download it.  It's, what a great idea, man. 
[00:24:00]  Is it a foregone conclusion?  Well, it's smart, because, you know, the record business sucks.  Yeah, it's done.  You know, they're figuring out other ways to make money as a band, you know?  Yeah.  Because when I was growing up, it was all about the bootleg videotape with the shaky  camera, and, you know, you were too scared, so you had to be really far from the stage,  because you knew you were safe there, and it was just like...  Cameras were giant, so you really sneak it in there.  But now, like, you fast forward a couple decades, and it's a nine-camera shoot where they're 
[00:24:30]  zooming in and out, and crowd shots, and this and that.  Beautiful.  Well, it's a way to make money off the same songs, which is smart.  I mean, it's like you're getting paid again on songs that you've written 30 years ago.  Right.  There's a fucking brilliance to that.  Yeah.  So, but we had a great time.  It was a lot of fun.  Did they play on Nannerpuss?  Are you obsessed with Nannerpuss now?  What's wrong with you, Jim?  I fucking...  It hit me yesterday afternoon, and what I kept thinking was fucking Travis's Nannerpuss dance. 
[00:25:00]  His Nannerpuss dance.  His Nannerpuss dance was so annoying to watch.  I wanted to run behind him and just...  I wanted to, like, fly and leap kick him through glass.  I was fucking all day with that goddamn song.  Nannerpuss.  Yeah.  Nannerpuss.  Right.  I was very annoyed with fucking Nannerpuss yesterday.  Stupid Nannerpuss.  I hate him.  But I watched the video again, and I had to.  Yeah, you had to.  When he knocks his eyeball off.  I showed my chick. 
[00:25:30]  I'm trying to get her hooked.  It's nothing more than getting a song stuck.  Oh, yeah.  It's taking over the world.  And, yeah, he knocks his own eye out.  It's really, really funny.  The problem with the Nannerpuss thing is it's too short.  It needs to be about a minute long.  Yeah.  Hit that there, Tim.  It's Nannerpuss!  You can call me Nannerpuss, Nannerpuss.  And guess what?  I love Nick.  Isn't it time for a serious breakfast?  You should call me Nannerpuss.  It sounds like Travis.  It sounds like Travis. 
[00:26:00]  It really does.  And then thinking of you doing your Nannerpuss dance, I was fucking so angry.  Are the Nannerpuss videos up?  It's infuriating.  I heard the one of E-Rock is pretty damn funny, too.  Yeah, the E-Rock video made it, and it's about a minute long, actually.  Really?  It's like 44 seconds long.  Yeah.  How do I find it, Sam?  Oh, you'd have to go to youtube.com slash E-Rock fan.  All right.  E-Rock fan.  I can find that video.  Nice.  Yeah, I got to see the E-Rock Nannerpuss dance video.  Absolutely.  E-Rock fan. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, here it is.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I mean, this is a visual, but...  I love Nannerpuss dance.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, it just keeps going and going. 
[00:27:00]  What a dolt.  You know what?  That video, that could do pretty well.  That is so stupid that it just might take off a little bit.  So he got 800 views since, you know.  Oh, really?  10 o'clock last night.  Hey, that's not bad.  I think because Nanopus is a key word right now.  And E-Rock is big right now, too.  Yeah, E-Rock's a monster. 
[00:27:30]  Come on.  He's huge.  He is a monster.  That's not what I meant.  Oh, that grapefruit juice in the eye on Friday.  Wow.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Did we get bluffing you up?  That's going to be tonight's E-Rock video.  Oh, he didn't like that at all.  No, that burned just a little bit.  E-Rock does the Nanopus.  Do you guys, just to end the bit, remember on Friday we had intern David walk in on Ranafez again?  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear that. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, then it's worth playing.  Let's get this out of the way.  We can do this before the break.  How do we set this up?  We've been sending intern David into the Ranafez show because Ronnie just dislikes David tremendously to the point where, you know, David's not even allowed to be in eyesight of Ronnie.  No.  When Ronnie's doing the Ranafez show, right?  Right.  And we told him walk in, and it didn't go well whatsoever.  So then we told him he needs to walk in with a peace offering.  Right.  And that's what happened? 
[00:28:30]  You guys got a nice sandwich for him and everything?  Well, we set him up with a sandwich.  Yeah.  I think, like, a Philly Blunt cigar and a megaphone.  We gave him Ann's old megaphone.  Okay.  Not the new one.  Yeah, because we said, look, you've got to get his attention right away.  And when Ronnie starts freaking out.  The megaphone.  Yeah.  So we sent in David with the sandwich and the cigar in one hand.  Yeah.  And then the megaphone in the other hand so he could shout, peace offering, peace offering.  Wait, so the sandwich was a Subway veggie sub?  Yeah.  Does Ron like those?  Yes, and we opened it. 
[00:29:00]  He does like them?  I think so.  I don't even know.  You should have got them when he hated.  I thought he hated.  He shouldn't get them when he should have got them tuna or something he hates.  Trust me.  Oh, okay.  It worked.  It worked.  It worked.  It wasn't about liking or hating the sandwich.  You'll see.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah, get his attention.  When Ronnie starts freaking out, peace offering, peace offering.  Don't get mad.  Look what I got for you, Ronnie.  We waited until he was not taking phone calls.  He was in the middle of a conversation with Fez.  Yeah.  Then that would be the perfect time to send him in.  Oh, you guys sent him in. 
[00:29:30]  All right.  Here's how it went down on Friday.  In case you missed it.  Fez.  What?  Mira.  I am not a butter face.  Honestly, I know a retarded person.  Peace offering.  You fucking time to get it.  All right.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy.  Easy, Dave.  Easy, Dave.  Two days.  Hello.  Two fucking days.  All right.  David, take it easy.  That's right.  This is David from the ONA show.  And you came in here with what?  I came in here to try to make a peace offering and to make things right between me and you. 
[00:30:00]  We're back live.  What?  Make things right between me and you.  There's no way.  I like how you said Dave tried to intimidate him and said, two fucking days in a row.  And Dave said, that's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Now, dummy.  I think we're fast forwarding to track five Jeremy calls.  What's this about? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yes.  Well, help me through this because I didn't get to hear this, unfortunately, on Friday.  Ron told him, because last time they just threw him right out the second he walked in.  Yeah.  So Eastside Dave was ready to do that again.  But Ron said, keep him in here.  We're getting Jeremy Coleman on the phone.  We're taking this to the highest level.  Yeah.  It's one of the VPs over at SiriusXM.  Yeah.  Jeremy Coleman.  And then they said, okay, we have Jeremy Coleman on the phone.  Jeremy?  Ron and Fez.  Ron Bennington here.  I hate to bother you during the show.  No problem.  Blanner said you wanted to talk to me.  What's going on? 
[00:31:00]  By the way, you guys are fantastic.  I'll tell you why.  That's not Jeremy Coleman.  What did you just say?  That's Fez.  I said you've been doing some great stuff with you.  Hold on.  I really appreciate everything you're doing.  Dave?  Yeah?  Take this kid out and take him down the fucking street.  That wasn't Jeremy Coleman.  That was Fez.  I heard it was Fez.  I'm taking you down there right now.  There you go.  So, yeah, David figured it was indeed Fez.  Yeah.  At that point, Ron Bennington decided to go with the tried-and-true method of physically 
[00:31:30]  removing him.  He was physically throwing him out.  Well, I think Fez blew it.  The clever ruse didn't work.  So, I think Ron was quoted saying the old Fez would have been able to pull off a Jeremy  Coleman voice.  Oh, right.  Fez was very happy to hear that.  Did that lead to another crying episode?  Might have.  All right.  Well, then it escalated to track six there, Iraq. 
[00:32:00]  Let's play this.  Take him to the fucking office.  You can have your sandwich in this car.  To the corporate office.  Get the...  Come here.  Take that fucking sandwich and wipe it down his fucking chest.  Come here.  Wipe it down his fucking chest.  Come here.  Come here.  Wipe it down his chest.  It's on your chest.  Don't get it on my...  Let's go.  Get it on my shirt.  This is not a joke.  Aw.  Take him out of the fucking building.  Introduce him and say if he's in here again.  If he's in here again during this fucking show, I'm going to fucking end.  Come here, kid. 
[00:32:30]  Come here.  Look at Mr. Banking.  Am I going to see you again in here?  No, never.  Are you going to see me?  No, never.  I'm going to leave at 12.  Every day I'm here for the internship, I'll leave at 12.  You're not...  You don't have an internship.  You don't have an internship.  You've destroyed a broadcasting school that's been around...  Me?  I destroyed it?  Yes.  How did I destroy it?  Because you're fucking bad luck schlep rock.  Schlep rock.  The sounds of...  Yeah.  The all and no that was going on the... 
[00:33:00]  That was the sound of a condiment-heavy sandwich being smeared on David's face.  Oh, no.  That was the sound of mustard on his glasses lens and mayonnaise in his hair.  Oh, no, no, no.  We go to track seven.  The $30 cigar.  Oh, yes.  This is when they mentioned the cigar that David had brought in.  Well, yeah.  The big piece of the offering.  Look at you sitting there with mayonnaise on your face.  Well, that's because he took the sandwich.  This is funny.  He gave you a Philly blunt.  A man... 
[00:33:30]  Oh, is that right?  That's the big joke, too.  He knows you like cigars, so he gives you a Philly.  This is...  Oh, it's a funny fucking show today.  No, this is not the $30 cigar.  It's very expensive.  It's a good cigar.  Look at that camera.  It's a good cigar.  All right, Dave, now this is turning into jail rape.  You know what?  Maybe he needs a jail rape.  Is that what you're here for?  Pull your pants down.  No, that's not what I'm here for.  You want a jail rape?  You want a jailhouse rape?  No.  What the hell?  Is that a good cigar, a Philly blunt?  It's not the best. 
[00:34:00]  No.  No, no, no.  However, one step above the old white owl.  They're just made for peeling, taking apart, and using the outside to make blunts with marijuana cigarettes.  I love the sound of David in the background.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  In David's defense, he was told that it was a $30 cigar, so that's why he went in defending that he had no idea that was a cheap cigar.  Is it a cheap cigar?  Oh, he was told it was $30. 
[00:34:30]  One of the other interns actually purchased the cigar.  Oh, of course.  It's nowhere near $30.  Go to track eight.  I miss him now that he's going out.  You feel like...  Yeah.  There's something about him that's just lovely.  Something about him I just get the biggest kick out of.  Smells like sandwich in here.  Get him back in.  Get him back in.  Bring him back in.  Yeah, just for a second.  Here's Ed.  Ed, you're on the Run A Face Show.  Hey, Ronnie.  Typical Jew boy.  Give you a cheap cigar.  Could have went for a more expensive one. 
[00:35:00]  What are you going to do?  He's just a kid.  Yeah.  We want you back in.  You fucking interrupted me.  Wait a minute.  What is he doing?  What is he doing in here?  What the fuck are you doing here?  David, how many times are you going to tell you?  How many times are you going to tell you?  You get the fuck out of here.  You're a fucking comedy chick, Dave.  Everyone laugh.  Keep laughing.  I like when you pit bull for me, Dave.  I like when you pit bull for me. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  Ronnie's inviting him in just to throw him out again.  Just to throw him out again.  Yeah.  Oh, it's like watching somebody abuse a dog.  Right.  Like, come here.  Come here.  No.  Right.  All right.  And then this.  What is he doing in here?  What is he doing?  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get him out.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  I hope he comes back. 
[00:36:00]  So, obviously, he just kept playing the same gag?  Well, yeah.  Or he kicks him out and invites him back in?  He did it about four times.  Yeah.  What you can't hear in the audio is what happened outside the studio.  David realized that he was just going to be thrown out again by the last time.  Yeah.  So, he was out in the hallway, and east side Dave said, we need you one more time.  And David said, no, I'm not going back in.  No, they're just going to throw me out.  No.  So, E-Rock came behind David and physically pushed him from the hallway to the studio.  door. 
[00:36:30]  David put his arms out at the studio door so he couldn't be in.  E-Rock chopped his arms down, pushed him into the studio, at which point they threw  him out, and David freaked out, lunged at Eric, raised his fist like he was going to  punch him in his face.  Wow.  And then settled down and just walked out and said, Eric, you...  Eric, Eric, Eric, you...  Wow.  I've never seen him so angry.  A little violence.  All right.  The final bit of audio from intern David walking in on the Rana Fest show on Friday.  I hope he gets back in here. 
[00:37:00]  Because there's something about the kid I just adore.  You know what I think it is?  What's that?  It's the...  It's the fact that he's got some kind of a want and a need.  A persistence.  David, he's not asking.  David, he's asking.  He's not asking.  He's not asking.  Ford, you're on the...  He's not asking.  What is he doing in here?  How many fucking times?  How many times, David?  I'm trying to do a show. 
[00:37:30]  Why are you trying to goddamn do a show here?  Oh, they just tormented the kid.  Rana Fest's Dave is hysterical.  Oh, yeah.  He just lunges at him with that voice.  At that point was the point that David raised his fist to E-Rock and then marched out of here.  And I had to find him down in the subway station to make sure he wasn't going to come back here and murder his rage.  Or jump in front of a train.  Yes.  I think that we need to try one more time. 
[00:38:00]  That might be a good idea, actually.  I know it's past St. Paddy's Day, but can we get a bagpipe band to lead David into the Rana Fest show?  Oh, my God, no.  Can we get a bagpiper to lead David into the Rana Fest show?  That would be.  I mean, Ron loves bagpipe music.  Because I don't think David has been properly heard by Ronnie.  No, I think he hasn't gotten a chance to get his point across.  And a bagpiper or a bagpipe band would certainly frown out Ronnie so poor little David would be able to say what he wants to say to Ronnie. 
[00:38:30]  Finally get his words out.  What do you think?  I think it's a great idea.  Do you?  I think so.  If a bagpiper could get a hold of us, we really could use one.  And I think Ron's always loved bagpipe music.  Really?  So that would be a very nice piece of it.  Oh, wow.  Look at that coincidence.  That's handy, then.  Sure.  David, people hate you on the radio, but really quickly, how did it go Friday?  Not very well.  No?  Not very well.  Did they really smear the sandwich in your face? 
[00:39:00]  Yes, they really did that.  Eastside Dave did, yes.  Man, I don't know what's going on with those guys, because they seem to be open to this whole peace offering thing we tried to do Friday.  And then what happens?  Yeah.  They didn't take too well to it.  Eastside Dave smeared the sandwich on my face.  I got mayonnaise in my hair.  Oh, no.  Really?  Mayonnaise was all in my hair.  I had to go take a shower when I got home.  Did E-Rock lick it off like a cat?  He wanted to, yeah.  I think the main problem is that Arani, I think, honestly, is afraid of Eastside Dave.  Dave's a weird guy. 
[00:39:30]  He's like a, like, what happens is Dave gets very possessive and territorial, and like Ron will say,  because I heard the audio and Ron will say, hey, get him in here, and Dave just fucking freaks out,  because Dave's whole gig is he wants Fez out of the picture, and he wants to be the controlling guy in that show,  so you're another guy coming in, and he sees that as some kind of a threat to him,  and Ron doesn't know how to tell Dave to back off, so he goes with it.  That's happened with other shit, too.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If we get a bagpipe guy, would you try one more time?  I'm willing to try.  I want to try to make up with this guy.  I don't want to be on his bad side. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, if we get, you know, a bagpiper will drown out Ronnie, and then we could finally, yeah.  How are we going to get a bagpiper?  Wow.  I don't know.  There was one at FH Riley's that wanted to come in here and do something.  We didn't get a hold of him in time.  Oh, okay.  Well, we'll get one.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, David.  Sure, you're welcome.  How do we put out an ad for a bagpiper?  Do you play an instrument that no girl will ever fuck you because you play?  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Another fine week of radio is upon us. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number should be on your display, right?  What is it?  What does it spell out?  Anyone?  It is?  Okay.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Nice.  Wow-1-WOW.  Wow-1-WOW.  It's the first three digits that I think most people have a problem with, to be honest  with you.  What happened to just having an 800 number? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they ran out of numbers.  Is that what happened?  Yeah.  They had to go with another combo?  They plum run out.  Stupid.  The United States, what?  Eliminated from the World Baseball Classic?  Not that I'm watching that crap, but...  But how does that happen?  Shouldn't we win every time out?  We always think we're the greatest at everything.  Because we call it, like, the World Series, but it's really only, like, our team.  I always hated that.  Yeah.  Growing up, I'm like, Dad, why is it the World Series when, you know, it's the Mets and the 
[00:41:30]  Oakland A's playing right now?  And then they call, you know, World Champions and things like that.  Right.  It's like, why?  But...  And then they have a World event.  Yeah.  And we get kicked right the fuck out.  Yeah.  Well, it's going to be Japan and Korea in the finals.  Ah, yeah.  The Asians, very good.  They picked up that baseball.  They know how to play baseball.  They picked it right up.  America's pastime.  Yeah.  Made it their own.  How about we go over there and play a little hockey, though?  Japan and Korea.  Hey.  I don't think they got that hockey thing figured out yet. 
[00:42:00]  Let me tell you another American pastime.  It was called the Manhattan Project.  And I think we walked away winners as far as that's concerned.  I do believe you're right.  So even Steven, huh?  You win a ball game.  Ooh.  Yeah.  We eliminated two cities from the map.  You've got to take your wins, but you can.  Didn't we have our good players playing, too?  Wasn't Jeter playing?  Yeah.  And Wright was playing.  We had the guys.  What happened?  What happened? 
[00:42:30]  Whatever.  All right.  What else is going on?  Oh, the Obama story is getting better and better.  There's quite a few little Obama stories going around, but yeah.  Fun Obama stories?  Yeah.  Or are we going to beat them up?  No, no.  I just heard this morning that during interviews he's sort of using what he says gallows humor  to get through this kind of thing.  And I don't think people are used to it.  I think it's kind of refreshing to have a guy in there that's willing to do this.  But I just don't.  They're going to shut him up, though. 
[00:43:00]  I just don't understand why he's able to do it.  He's able to make jokes and everything like that.  Of course, he apologized to the reports.  Well, he's not really able.  He's not able to do it.  I mean, they're giving him crap for that special.  But he's doing it.  The thing is, he's not able to do it, but he's doing it.  So he has to understand as president or as a human being the concept of comedy and then  getting in trouble for off-the-cuff remarks.  And like he said, gallows humor with certain things.  And it's one of those things that there's no clear set, you're going to get in trouble 
[00:43:30]  for this.  You're not getting in trouble for this.  So I could say this when you're rolling like that off-the-cuff, you just don't know.  Things are coming out your mouth.  Now that he got in a little bit of trouble for his misstep or whatever you want to call  it, I would love to know what he thinks of the Imus situation.  Yeah.  A little different.  Because he did say Imus should be fired for that nappy-headed hoe thing.  He certainly did.  And then he makes a Special Olympics joke, which is very insensitive to the retarded 
[00:44:00]  Americans.  Exactly.  What I find very funny about that, they found the Special Olympics bowling champion.  Of course they did.  And the guy, I think if I got it correct, has bowled six perfect games.  Yes.  His average is like 200 and I think it's like 236, somewhere around there.  He's like a ridiculous bowler.  I bet he wears the bowling shoes everywhere.  Right.  Probably just carries the bowling ball around wherever he goes, too. 
[00:44:30]  And he's pretty much a better bowler than most of the people walking the side.  Well, whoopity-doo.  I can hold a job.  Well, for the most part.  But I guess they're trying to get the Special Olympics bowling champion to bowl against Obama.  Let's put a mow wig on the ball and it's his twin.  You see what they're doing, though?  Smarted twin brother. 
[00:45:00]  They're taking something somebody said and they're trying to further their cause with it.  Outrage in this country is so fucking phony.  Absolutely.  Phony.  Absolutely.  Now, they couldn't just go, hey, look, we really didn't like what the president said,  but we know he was just kidding and he said he was sorry, so we'll move on.  They can't just say that.  Find me a retarded bowler.  I could be every bowler.  Holy shit, we're a country of fucking assholes.  Yeah.  Obama can't bowl this guy, though.  No, he can't.  He would look ridiculous.  Exactly.  When he throws his gutter balls and gets his 135 or whatever the hell Obama's bowling. 
[00:45:30]  And dummy is bowling a 380 and his fucking inside of his ball still smells like peanut butter.  380.  Exactly.  He added the score wrong.  He's stupid.  He's stupid.  You know, they say his score is really good, but he probably just, oh, I got 28 for that.  He probably got a total of three pins he knocked down, just added a couple zeros.  Just put strikes in every frame.  Yeah.  A perfect game for him means he didn't throw the ball at any infants. 
[00:46:00]  He didn't fucking take the ball and fucking, he didn't try to eat the ball or break his own foot with it.  Perfect game.  That's right.  We don't think you're a good baller.  Yeah.  Yeah, he always chips teeth on balls.  So whenever he doesn't.  And what they don't tell you is that perfect game, he walks the ball down to the pins and throws it and kicks over the ones and yells,  It's awful bowling shoes. 
[00:46:30]  We should play Stephen Lynch's bowling song today.  Oh, God, should we?  Yes, we should.  You don't like the bowling song, eh?  He was very proud of the bowling song when he came in to debut it on our show.  It was like the, uh, we didn't start the fire version of bowling.  Yeah.  Yeah, he just rattled off a bunch of stuff.  It was a very important Stephen Lynch song, though.  He really wanted to.  He hates it now.  Well, because of us. 
[00:47:00]  We ruined it for him.  We got the bowling song.  How do we ruin the bowling song when it just sucked?  You thought it sucked?  Of course it sucked.  I thought it was a little heavy on, uh, on...  Bowling references?  Bowling references.  No one knows bowlers' names.  I know Weber.  Dude.  What's some of those other, uh, bowlers we got?  They bowl pretty good.  I don't know.  Uh...  I do know that the retarded...  Obama?  Uh...  A retard? 
[00:47:30]  My, uh, cousin Rick?  He bowled at 300.  Uh...  Uh...  I couldn't tell you.  It's not...  My godfather, Uncle Eddie, he bowled.  I'll stop every so often if I see a bowler throw a ball down there,  and he gets that hook that goes right off the gutter.  Yeah.  And then it's just like, almost gutter, and you're wham!  Wham!  To the pocket.  That left turn at the last second?  Nice.  And I'll be like, wow, that's really impressive.  Click!  I have no idea who the guy is.  I don't care.  You make a really good point.  Have you ever seen a second bowling ball thrown down the alley? 
[00:48:00]  No!  When you're clicking around TV.  No.  You'll stop for a half a shot.  Right.  Like if you see...  If the guy just released it.  If you see the guy lining up, that's not good enough.  You're in?  No.  With the second he releases it.  Yeah, yeah.  But if he's lining up the shot, nope, sorry.  Sorry.  I'm moving on already.  If I hear, plang, plang, plang, and pins go flying everywhere, I'm out.  This guy, psychotic, psychotic, I hate your name, it's hard to say, from Wackback, 
[00:48:30]  the pins are shaped like his best friends.  He gave tips to Obama.  Number one was lick fork and stick and socket.  Number two, accidentally injure a younger sibling.  He's got to stick his tongue over the hand dryer before every shot.  Number three, run happily through patio door, dash, spoil party.  When birthday cake comes out, be frightened and smash it on the floor. 
[00:49:00]  These are great tips.  I say we play the ballroom song.  What do you say?  What do you say?  It's horrible.  You think?  There's nothing anyone likes about it.  I don't remember it.  It's very catchy.  It's a catchy song.  We'll play it for a little while.  Until I can't take it anymore.  And then you turn your mic on and just start screaming. 
[00:49:30]  Okay.  But for real, though.  See how long...  I mean, I know the gag is to like...  Instantly go...  Song starts and then you lose your mind.  But really, let it settle in and then...  I'll give it another chance.  I haven't heard it in a long time.  All right, here we go.  So I'll give it a chance.  Stephen Lynch's bowling song.  I can't take...  Okay, cool.  I'll just play it fast.  You watch me on your TV 
[00:50:00]  Say that my job is easy  Say I am not athletic  You think my sport's pathetic  But you can't judge me  Till you've walked a mile 
[00:50:30]  In my bowling shoes  So I don't get all the ladies  Got a mullet from the 80s  I'm known throughout the valleys 
[00:51:00]  As the prophet of the alleys  And as I roll the ball I cry  Let me bowl and let me die  I'm almighty Malachi  The bowling god  The smell of rosin gets me high  Kiss those fucking pins goodbye  I'm almighty Malachi  The bowling  Bowling  God  Thank you for coming out tonight  All right, one more verse 
[00:51:30]  Guide up all that smooth and all black  I keep it in my favorite ball sack  Oh yeah  I get a tough feeling in my soul  As I finger every hole  As I finger every hole 
[00:52:00]  And as I roll the ball I cry  Let me bowl and let me die  I'm almighty Malachi  The bowling god  The smell of rosin gets me high  Kiss those motherfucking pins goodbye  I'm almighty Malachi  Malachi  The bowling  Bowling  Not a single man will try  To beat almighty Malachi  All who challenge me are slain  Come on fuckers, pick a lane  Marshal Holtman, Gary Dickens  Get in line, figure ass kickin'  John Petraglia, Norm Duke 
[00:52:30]  You're so lame  I've had it  He's just naming some bowlers  I can't take when he starts naming the bowlers  Hurl the pearl  Are you scared to give the ball a hurl  How about Dickey Weber  And his son Pete  I'll turn the motherfuckers  To cream of weed  And as I roll the ball  I cry  Let me bowl and let me die  I'm almighty Malachi  The bowling god  The smell of rosin gets me high  Kiss those motherfucking pins goodbye 
[00:53:00]  I'm almighty Malachi  The bowling  The bowling god  Yeah  The bowling god  Damn  But his fucking voice  The song is put together well  If he was singing about anything else  That would be a massive hit  As a song  The emotion in that goddamn song  It's a tolerable song as far as 
[00:53:30]  It's not bad to listen to  Okay, there's a guy singing about bowling  Yeah  But because you know Lynch's stuff  And he always  It's a very funny songwriter  That's the problem  It's hard to listen to it  Just as an enjoyable song  Right  Yeah  You're just  See when he gets into  Talking about  Naming the bowlers names  I just can't  Yeah  I just can't  Wait  And who's Malachi  Where's bowling popular?  Like the midwest still?  Oh god  In the mid-70s I think  Midwest  Mid-70s  Yeah 
[00:54:00]  I don't know  I know the retro  They got candle pin bowling  Up in Boston  Ew  Yeah, that's the dumbest sport ever  Sunday morning you'd turn on the TV  And they'd be candle pin bowling  Which you don't even get the pleasure  Of getting a strike  No  Because it's almost impossible  And it's just you  Clink, clink, clink  Unless you're a pro  You hear a little clink, clink  You ever seen candlestick bowling?  I certainly haven't  For real  Never  Never heard of it  Until you just said it  It's the lamest thing ever  Dude, the pins are  Thinner than your water bottles  And the ball you use  You hold it in the palm of your hand 
[00:54:30]  It doesn't have little holes in it  It's a tiny ball  It's like a shot put  Like the pins on fire  That'd be great candlestick bowling  Well, that would be good  Candlestick bowling  I'd say  Candlestick  One of the worst sports ever  Curling?  Worse than curling?  Curling looks like  I haven't got into curling  Honestly, curling looks like  It would be fun  Curling  You know it looks like  It would be fun  No  Not if you're  Like a sweeper  Broom guy?  No, fuck the broom guy  I don't think  Anyone knows what they're doing  Unless you're in the Olympics  And you gotta  Yeah 
[00:55:00]  And make it slippery  In front of the thing  Nah  You just throw the  What was it called again?  The stone  I think they call it the stone  Oh, wow  Look at you  Look at that, Jimmy  When you want to play  No, it's fucking awful  Look at that  That's probably what the retard does  Look at how tiny the ball is  And how the hell  Are you supposed to get a strike?  Oh  God  Look how ridiculous that is  Who invented that?  And who decided that  The regular bowling wasn't good enough?  Wasn't good enough  They had to invent their own version 
[00:55:30]  Wonderful  Did they bring that over from Europe?  From England?  I'm sure some crappy friggin' country  But they still go old school up there  And they have candlestick bowling  That's fucking awful  In the Boston area  Worcester, Mass  Worcester, Mass had it?  Worcester  In good old Worcester?  Going into the city  Worcester  Yeah  All right  Let's say hi to Woody in Kentucky  Woody  Hey there, Woody  Hey  Hey  That bowler also has a perfect score 
[00:56:00]  As fucking up the family photo  Oh, no  Wow  Check it out  Oh, no  Oh, boy  Let's say hi to Fontaine in Virginia  Fontaine  Hiya, boys  Hey  He said something about  The Special Olympics champion bowler  Fuck is that what they call their barber?  Oh, oh  Oh, a bowler  See, because there's a bowl on his head  Let's say hi to Max in Fairfield  Max  Hey, guys  Hey  How's it going, guys?  Good, man 
[00:56:30]  I was wondering if they're going to start calling this Obama controversy  Waterhead gate  Oh  That's fucking hilarious  There is no need for  Waterhead gate  Such funny humor like that  Tony on Long Island  Tony  Wow  Yeah  What's up, Tony?  I'm not calling about bowling  Okay, that's fine  Anthony, the other day you mentioned you worked at Chicago  Yeah  What kind of car Elliot drove?  Was it a Bentley?  A DeLorean  Oh, my God, that's right 
[00:57:00]  It was the DeLorean  How do you know that?  I used to work there back in the 80s  Wait, who's that?  Really?  Was he the owner or something?  Elliot was the owner, yeah  Of Chicago Pizza?  Yeah, well  He was a drunken bum  I think he's dead now  So you don't have to worry  And cut this part out of the broadcast  I'm not worried  That's it  Punch it up  Alright, but he drove a DeLorean in?  Yeah, now that I think about it  Sure, I do remember a DeLorean  From Elliot  I went up to Elliot and asked him for a raise once  I was a lowly dishwasher 
[00:57:30]  Making a minimum wage  And I asked him for a raise  And just like anything  Like a nickel  Sure  A dime an hour  Something where you feel like you're doing well  And he was like, no  And I was really good  At, you know  It's washing dishes  But, like  I  It was like a ballet  Me and the washing  The dishwasher  I was pulling dishes out  Putting them in  Stacking them up  In fluid  It was like a dance  Nice  And, uh 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, this motherfucker  Give me shit  He's dead  Let's go to Joe  Joe  Hey, what's happening, guys?  How do you do, Joe?  I'm driving in my car  Anyway, hey, listen  Candle pin bowling's the original sport  You guys are referring to 10 pin bowling as regular bowling  Well, someone wised up and said  Let's make this a little more fun for everybody  That candle pin bowling stinks  Name a worse sport  For real 
[00:58:30]  It'll be a little side bit we do today  Worse sport  I just can't get it  What's that shit that the  What's that crap that the Canadians play  With that stupid stone on the ice  That's what we were just talking about  Curling  I would rather play  That's just shuffleboard on ice  Who doesn't enjoy a little game of shuffleboard?  That game's stupid  Candle pin bowling worse  I'd have to say  Candle pin bowling  You gotta be a real bowler to play it  Candle pin bowling eats my asshole  Can pin bowling was designed for retards and fat people who can't bowl candle pins 
[00:59:00]  Are you sticking up for candle pin bowling songs?  Yeah, what's wrong, sir?  Actually, I am  I know  But hey  Have you ever played candle  I stick up for a lot of fucking retarded things  Well, have you ever played?  Well, then don't knock it  No, have you?  I've played!  It sucks!  Have you ever played this thing?  We lived in Boston  I went and played  It sucked  I hated it  I'll tell you something that sucks  Jim Croce  Just ask Jimmy  I like Jim Croce  I don't want to guess 
[00:59:30]  I wouldn't answer a question  Right  But I like Jim Croce  Let me throw a sport at you  Badminton  Which is worse?  Candle pin bowling or badminton?  Candle pin bowling  Badminton is silly  It's goofy  But it's outside  It's usually not taken seriously  You're just kind of at a barbecue kind of a thing  What do they call it?  The birdie  The birdie  B-I-R-D-I-E, I think  They do call it the birdie, right?  The birdie  Even badminton is better than candle pin bowling  Name a worst sport, I'm telling you  I'm trying to think of one 
[01:00:00]  Shit eating  What about croquet?  Croquet  Croquet  Croquet sucks  Let me tell you something  But  Croquet is fun  For three seconds  Well it's like playing pool on your lawn though  It's not that bad  No, it takes too long to set up  It's stupid  I don't get the part where you put your foot on someone's ball  And then just  On your own ball  And then just whack someone else's ball into the bushes  What is that move called?  The fuck you move  Yeah, it's called the fuck you 
[01:00:30]  I'm launching your ball into the street  And you're going to have to hit it from the street  You're going to put it through the wicket  I can't get it through the wicket  I love those backyard games  Because you just start making up your own rules  Yeah  Ridiculous stuff  And then what happens is  You play by the rules for the first minute  And then you just start wailing the ball with the mallet  And seeing how far you can get it  Knock it into a tree  It comes like two inches from your friend's head  He yells at you  You have more beer  And who hasn't fractured their instep 
[01:01:00]  Because you don't even hit it right  When you're stepping on the other guy's ball  Yeah, you smash your ankle with the mallet  It's like, fuck  Game with a mallet  What is this?  Dave in Baltimore  Dave  Yeah  Hey  Yeah  Hey  Hey what?  Well, you called our show  I said Dave in Baltimore  That usually means it's your turn  Oh, it's called the shuttlecock  Jimmy, I knew it wasn't called the birdie  Oh, is it really?  Yeah, go ahead, Dave  Duck pin bowling sucks 
[01:01:30]  What is duck pin bowling?  I never heard of duck pin bowling  I thought that was camel pin  What is duck pin bowling?  No, no, no  Duck pin are these little short  Little stubby pins  And you've got to roll this stupid ball  The size of a shot put  That's camel pin bowling  No, no, no  Down here in Baltimore  They've got a thing called duck pin bowling  Because you have to make it local  Oh, my God  Because it's a different name  But it's the same thing  I had stupid day  No, it isn't 
[01:02:00]  The candlestick bowling  Are real thin sticks  Right  These things are like actual pins  Find me some duck pin bowling  They look like real bowling pins  But they're small  All right, we're going to look at  Yeah, they're real tiny  Do you know what's great, though?  Is opposite bowling  It's where all the pins are laying down  And you have to bowl  Until you knock them back standing up  I play that a lot  That sounds very hard to me  Opposite bowling is very good  Opposite bowling  Yes  Sounds very difficult  It is  Very hard sport  Yeah, look at their little chubby fucking  Little chubby pins 
[01:02:30]  Aw, he's not lying, man  All right  I've never had a duck pin bowling before  But you don't roll the ball  In opposite bowling  You have the ball there  And you have to leave it there  And then you have to run  And kick it as hard as you can  Down the thing  And knock the pins back up  High scores are one  Somebody got that 1950  All right, we're going to go with  Cody in Indiana  We're trying to  We're trying to find  The worst sport ever  So far, it's candle pin bowling  Candle pin bowling  Yep  Let's go with Cody in Indiana  Go ahead, Cody  Well, the birdie in Badminton  Is actually called the shuttlecock 
[01:03:00]  But the worst game is fucking cricket  That game  Cricket  Cricket  Could be the  But who's played it in America  For real?  Jamaicans play it or something  Nobody, because it sucks  You know, I actually read  The rules of cricket once  And after reading the rules  I still don't know  What the object of the game  I have no clue  Yeah  Like you could hit for days  Or something  For days? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah  Like you could just keep hitting  Until something happens  But it's not an out  It's something else  It's not a bad  This is what I remember  About reading the rules of cricket  Here's where  Here's where  Fucking ten pin bowling  What's it called?  Duck pin?  No, no, no  The one with the candle pin bowling  Yeah  It comes  It's right below  Toenail eye poking  And right above  AIDS gargling  That's where it falls  Fucking horrendous  Oh wow 
[01:04:00]  We're gonna have a problem  With Tiger in Detroit  Tiger, go ahead  Hey, what about like  Bocce ball or horseshoes?  Horseshoes are okay  Know why I like bocce ball?  The only good thing  About horses is  Eventually one of them  Drunken hillbillies  Is gonna mash the last tooth  Out of his ugly wife  With one when he gets drunk  Do you like the horseshoes, then?  No, I'm not a big  Horseshoe player  What about bocce ball, though?  Bocce, what?  Just because I'm a guinea?  We used to play  Extreme bocce  I used to like bocce  You play the extreme  Bocce ball, though  No, I don't like bocce either 
[01:04:30]  Really? You gotta play bocce ball  Like on a hill and stuff  I like that shuffleboard  On the table in the bar  Where you gotta kind of  Lag the thing over the edge  Oh yeah, sure  Get it over the line  That's kind of funny  And you put the shaky stuff on there  Make it all nice  Oh, I thought you meant like  A little  I'm a big fan of paper football  Okay, found a lamer game  Paper football  Paper football  When you were bored in school  It was beautiful  One down  Two  Second down 
[01:05:00]  Third down  You gotta get to the edge of the table  It's not hanging  Yes, it is  Put your finger across  And you would go like this  Yeah, yeah  You would angle your hand  See?  See a move  No, didn't fuck you  No, didn't fuck you  Field goal time  Field goal attempt  And you'd always just try to get  Into the guy's eye  Right  While he's making the goal  With his stupid fingers  Stupid pointy  Paper football  Take an eye out  All right, let's go back  To Dan in Houston  Dan  Good evening 
[01:05:30]  We won't be ignored, Dan  I'm not ignoring you  All right  Worst sport by far  Croquet  We did the croquet  We decided  It's like  It's like pool on your lawn  It's not that bad  All right  The guy just lost it  All right  You know what sport I don't like either?  It's right around the thing  Is this  Is this candle pin bowling?  Yeah  I don't like fart skipping  What is that?  It's where you have to skip in a circle 
[01:06:00]  And like once you stop farting  You lose the game  You start farting and skip in a circle  And once your fart is over  That sounds like a lot of control  Yeah  Maybe a lot of rectal control  Yeah, it's hard to get people to play  And people lie  Because like, no, it's silent  The whole room stinks  Yeah  It's not popular  I set up like little stands in my apartment  And no one will play with me  I just have empty stands  I fart skip  Let's say hi to Scott in Boston  Hey guys  I love you  I love the show  You must like the candle pin bowling thing 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, actually  I'll dork myself up  I'm in a league  I bowl every week up here  Candle pin bowling  And duck pin  They actually have up here  In New England as well  Duck pin  Just for your clarification  It's the same shape  Pens as the 10-10  But they're smaller  I guess people can't hear us  When they're on hold  Yeah  What do they listen to on hold?  Is there another station on?  I don't know  Because we went over this whole thing there, Scott  Because every caller has told us stuff we said already  I think duck pin bowling they invented 
[01:07:00]  So maybe you get a higher score  Because the ball is just as small as candle pin bowling  Yes  But you get a little more surface area  A little more, yeah  Yeah  What's your highest game in candle pin bowling?  And don't lie, Scott  It's like a 145  No  A 145  And you're probably pretty good at it  I do, okay  But the thing is  With a 10-pin bowling and candle pin bowling  A candle pin bowling  You can really  You can toss those balls down 
[01:07:30]  I would  Overhand it  Overhand throws  Into the candle pins  Oh, how angry would the proprietor get?  Can we play one round of candle pin bowling?  Overhand  Yeah  Is there a  Can you set  Why don't you make an alley in your  Would they allow us?  Oh, in your basement  And my basement's about full now  Oh, now  No more room for anything else, huh?  That big fucking hallway in your basement  I saw you  Yeah  It's fucking complex  Jesus  Ridiculous  It's amazing 
[01:08:00]  It's amazing  Jimmy got a tour  Daddy got a tour  A weapons demonstration  Yeah  Theater's amazing  Yeah, it was fun  Fucking  It's nice, man  Goodness  It's a good spot  Lots of guns  Lots of guns  Liquor downstairs  That'll never be a problem  Boo  People running all over the place  You'll never have an issue there  Party going on  You can walk around Anthony's place 
[01:08:30]  Counting the potential problems  You really do  Like if you had a baby  You'd point out things that aren't childproof  Right  At my house you'd just point out things that are just  Not adult proof  You just whisper to yourself  Oh, that'll never be a problem  It's like  When is Ant going to have a party ruined  Like fucking the New Year's Eve party on Boogie Nights  It will eventually happen  Someone just comes running from downstairs  I shot my ear off  I was just showing the gun  No one's allowed in that wing 
[01:09:00]  I know  We're just making jokes  I know  Jason, Carolina  How are you, Jason?  Hey, my boys  I really enjoy that classical music you have while we're on hold  Apparently  Something's going on  The gayest sport ever  Definitely hacky sack  Sorry, Hope  Oh, I did a little hacky sack  Hacky sack is  It should have been around in the 60s  It's some hippie kind of stupid thing  That was big when grunge was in 
[01:09:30]  No, you get like  You get like the Grateful Dead  1973 Oakland  And you throw it on someone's system  And you're in the backyard drinking beers on a summer day  Just hanging out  Playing a little hacky sack  Yeah, look at that, man  The guy listening to the dead  It's great, man  Now kick it over here  Fucking take your hacky sack  And throw it on the roof like Biff did  With that basketball with the kids  You ever try the hacky sack?  No  No  Little knee  Knee, knee, knee 
[01:10:00]  No  Foot, foot  It's a bean bag  Yeah  The only guy that was cool to have the hacky sack  Is if he had a bag of weed in his pocket  Then you would hang with him  Until I was taken care of  Someone was always stoned for hacky sacking  It was a good just killing time  If you're in a park or something  With a bunch of people  I would like to just run up to somebody  Playing hacky sack  And kick him in the balls  And go  I thought it was the hacky sack  Same consistency  If you get your hacky sack just right  Sorry, sir 
[01:10:30]  They used to advise that you run it over with your car  Until you got that nice, mushy  Really?  Hacky sack  You actually know hacky sack's protocol  As far as prepping the hacky sack?  I kind of do  God damn  What are you going to do?  All right, how about this, Ant?  Uh, Justin in Huntington  What's up?  Oh, hello  I'm a little bit nervous  Am I talking to the most successful radio show  In all of satellite history?  Oh, wow  I'm glad that you brought that back to the table  Yes, of course 
[01:11:00]  According to Jay Leno and many others  Uh, what do you got, Justin?  Uh, frisbee golf  Is the gayest fucking thing on the planet, period  Frisbee golf  I never played  I heard about that  I never played frisbee golf  Thank God  I like to throw the frisbee here and there  But  What was the other game?  What was it called?  Uh, uh, ultimate  Ultimate Frisbee  Ultimate Frisbee  Ultimate Frisbee  Where like  You're  If you have the frisbee  You can throw it to somebody else  Everyone's running around  But as soon as you catch it 
[01:11:30]  You gotta stop  Stop  Stop  And try to advance the frisbee forward  That's silly  I hated that game  What?  That's pointless hippie nonsense, too  You don't need that shit in life  Yeah, frisbee golf is pretty beat  I'm with you on that  What do you, like  How do you  How do you not win?  Frisbee golf?  Yeah, like you just  You wing the frisbee up by the green, I guess  No  And then what, you gotta hit the flag?  No, I think  Uh, I think it's set up like  Yeah, like that  There you go 
[01:12:00]  They have a little like  Oh, you gotta put it into like a basket  That's frisbee outdoor basketball  Yeah, it's sort of  It's tough to call it golf  If the hole's above ground like that  Yeah  If it's like a  It looks like a bird feeder  Basically  You know what you're saying when you play that?  You're saying  I'm such a fucking zero  That I like frisbee  And I'm a complete  I have no friends to play it with  I can't find as big a zero as myself  To throw this fucking plastic plate with  Yeah, you really only need two people 
[01:12:30]  I'm not a fan of combining two sports  Like I like golf  And I like to throw the frisbee a little bit  Yeah  At the beach or whatever  But you throw them together  Make frisbee golf  No, not so much  No  Bowling and football would be a fun one  And if someone's going to bowl  You just tackle them violently  Into the fucking gutter  Violently  That's the key there  Not just tackle them  Yeah  You're just getting a lot of anger out  Just a really hard blindside  Right  Or if the whole team on the sidelines  Gets to throw bowling balls  At whoever's running with the football 
[01:13:00]  On the football field  That would be nice  Yeah  Watching them try to dodge big bowling balls  Now here's a guy that's cool  Speaking of bowling  It's not as easy as I look at this  No, it's not  And you should do this one  This might pique your interest  Yes  Jeff in New Hampshire  Go ahead, Jeff  Hey, Ed  Check it out  I found a nice way to make  Tenzin bowling a little bit more interesting  Instead of using the ball  Just use the 5-0  The Desert Eagle  Ah  That would be fun 
[01:13:30]  Works out very nicely  It actually is fun shooting bowling pins with pistols  It is  It's great  They make good targets  Do they come apart good?  Come apart?  Oh, yeah  If you hit them in the low-mid section  They explode  Yeah, because I was thinking  They're pretty dense  Nice big caliber weapon  Yeah  Do some damage  Now, can you get a strike  If you're shooting the 10 pins  With the Desert Eagle?  Well, usually only  You only need like three or four  Magazine, the Eagle's only up seven  Okay  No way  You get a strike 
[01:14:00]  You can wreck everything  I don't know  I don't know how that would work  Not with one shot  Yeah  Alright, thank you, sir  We're going to Steve in New Jersey  Steve  Hey, boys  What's going on?  Hey, man  Hey, my grandpa  He told me about this game  When I was a kid  Back in Ireland  In the old days  He used to take a cannonball  And try to roll it across town  And he used to call it road bowling  Road bowling?  Yes  Why would you  Why would you want to do that?  It was like the most retarded game  It was to see  Who can get a ball across town  On the ground

Maybe that's the worst  Yeah, I did a little human bowling  We should bring that bit back  Jimmy, would you do a little  Human bowling?  What is it?  Human bowling  You go into like  A little cage thing  Oh, no  I wouldn't  You're very secure  And then they roll you down a ramp  Into some oversized bowling pins  No  I'd throw up  I'd get dizzy  Well  You're very dizzy 
[01:18:00]  That's why we should do it with you  I wasn't there that day  I don't know what  No, you were there  You just didn't do it  I'm convinced you didn't do it now  I think I was the guinea pig that day  Huh  Because you were definitely there  Yeah  Because I saw the pictures of you  At the broadcast  Was there?  Because I didn't see me  At the broadcast  I thought maybe  They had me somewhere else  Because they had decided  To do that a couple of times  No  You were definitely there  Okay  There were other pictures  I just didn't post  Because they were just us hanging out  They were kind of boring  They weren't like anything special  Human bowling 
[01:18:30]  Frisbee football  Tetherball  What's the  Oh, tetherball  Worst sport ever  Isn't that the one  With the rope and the ball  And you've got to keep punching it  Yeah, you punch it  Napoleon Dynamite  Loved playing a little tetherball  Always trying to get the hot chicks to play  But they would just laugh at them  Yeah, because it's the stupidest thing ever  Yeah  That might be it right there  Tetherball  Is way worse than  Candle pin bowling  Yes  I will say yes  That game sucked  You would play for maybe 30 seconds 
[01:19:00]  And go  Alright, well  What now?  You'd just get somebody  That was taller than you  That could just get over your head  And just keep hitting it  Hitting it  Hitting it  And you're trying to hit it  The other way  And just know it's over  And you're jumping  But you can't quite reach it  Jumping  That game stinks  Alright  I guess we can move on  Somebody wanted to hear  Stephen Lynch's Special Olympics song  I don't think we played it the other day  When we were talking about  The Obama Special Olympics bowling thing  No  So how about we go to break with that today 
[01:19:30]  If we can find it  We got that?  We got E-Rock?  Alright, we'll continue in just a bit  Get into some of the stuff  That's happening in the world  After the break  I'm going to tinkle  I think I got tinkled too, man  Ooh  Opie and Anthony  Watch them run  Watch them fall  Watch them try to catch a ball  Olympics  Special Olympics  Watch them laugh 
[01:20:00]  Watch them drool  Watch them fall into the pool  That's diving  At the Special Olympics  And I know  Full well  That I will burn in hell  But those guys playing wheelchair basketball  Gotta be about the funniest friggin' thing 
[01:20:30]  I've ever seen in my life  At the Special Olympics  Verse 2  Kid with downs  Wins the race  Even though he stood in place  Olympics  Special Olympics  Olympics  Round his neck 
[01:21:00]  Gold medals hung  Resting on his giant tongue  Olympics  Special Olympics  But I kid  When I sing  Cause these games  Are a beautiful thing  Okay, really  I'm just avoiding karma  Cause I know my children  Could be born crippled and blind  And semi-retired 
[01:21:30]  I'll have to spend all my time  At the Special Olympics  I feel so guilty  I can't even tell you  Opie and Anthony  Jim Norton  I was just telling Ant  That my Brick Breaker score  On the BlackBerry  On the BlackBerry  Yes 
[01:22:00]  Do you have Brick Breaker  On the iPhone?  I'm sure I could get it  No, what games  Does the phone come with?  Oh my god  No, the basic games  Not the ones you download  Where you get the phone  And there are the games  Like I got  Holy shit  I get Wordsmith  And Brick Breaker  I think  I think I  Oh, and I think I get  Some kind of  Hold'em game too  Oh, and that's it  The full version  Of Grand Theft Auto  I could play on the iPhone  For real?  I could 
[01:22:30]  No  I don't know  3D Brick Breaker  Really?  Well, I was  Letting people in  On my Brick Breaker score  But I gotta stop  Cause I'm up to  220 some odd  Thousand  Okay  And I got 82 lives left  82 lives  And my lives  Keep going up  So I told Anthony  I will  The only thing  That is gonna make me  Lose this game  At this point  Is some kind of  God forbid  Paralysis  Or old age 
[01:23:00]  Settling in  You  I will never  Lose this game  I play when I go  Up and down my elevator  Just a quick minute  Or two here  Cause I've  I've beaten the game  How can you pause it?  Why is it pause  When you stop?  You can just pause  Anytime and go back  To it being just a phone  How do you get points though?  How many points do you get?  Like for what?  An extra man  Well each board  You get I don't know  A couple thousand  No not even a couple thousand  I've gone through the game  Like 12 times  You should start wearing 
[01:23:30]  12 or something like that  An American flag tie  By the way  And walking around  And telling people  How good you are  At brick breaker  Yeah  But then I was telling Ed  Cause he goes  Who's got the high score?  Cause you can check  High scores online  There's a guy  The high score  Is 10 million  On the nose  Yeah  And I told Ed  That guy never lost  That game  He decided  This is a good place  To stop the game  And post my score  There's no way  He all of a sudden  Started losing guys  Around 10 million 
[01:24:00]  And stopped at 10 million  He must have stopped  At 10 million  With hundreds of guys left  Hundreds  And 10th place  Is 3 million  So I'm thinking  I might just  Keep going  Crack the top 10  Maybe  But it's a game  That I will never lose now  I broke it  My lives  I'll lose a few men  But I'm gaining more men  Than I'm losing  82 guys  That's crazy  Well then keep going  Until you crack the top 10  You'll be famous  I've been playing  On the phone  Honestly I've been playing  The same game  For 3 weeks 
[01:24:30]  Really?  Yeah  3 weeks  And I'm not gonna lose  Anytime soon  Jesus Christ  Go for the 10 million  Why not?  Just do it in the elevator  It'll take forever  I don't know what to do  I need like a  I need an end  Yeah  E-Rock goes  Stop playing it  And what?  Just blow my really good game?  Yeah  Don't you need an ending  When you play your video games?  It's supposed to get harder  Yeah, yeah  Unless the game sucks  Well 
[01:25:00]  Brickbreaker was exciting  Until you go through  The second round  Of all the boards  Because the  First round is whatever  Second round  It gets faster  A little more challenging  And then when you finish  The second round of boards  It goes back to the easy mode  So now it's impossible to lose  Oh, it goes back to easy mode?  Yes  You would think it would keep going  Oh, then  Okay  You'd think it would keep getting  Harder and harder  But at this point  No, it did not get any harder  And I've  I know how to beat every board  Start doing tricks  I do tricks 
[01:25:30]  What do you mean?  Slicing  I wait for the last possible second  And then slice my paddle over  I mean  Just dump stuff  No, no  I mean tricks with  In reality  Not in the game  Like try doing it  Looking in a mirror  Ah  See, like  Give yourself some challenges  Like that  Do it  With an eye patch on  You got the king of  Kong fans  Checking in  CokeLogic  Submit the score  Twin Galaxies  Twin Galaxies 
[01:26:00]  Don't I have to videotape  Me playing  Breaker  And then someone says  Blue Heeler  Excuse me  We got a  Brick Breaker  Kill screen  I wish there was a kill screen  If anyone's interested  I wish  I wish there was a kill screen  Blue Heeler goes  Stop calling it  Brick Breaker  It's Breaker  You're playing Breaker  Alright  I mentioned this  Because it was going to lead  To a discussion  I don't know what to do  With this though  It says  The ten most  Controversial video games  Ever 
[01:26:30]  And we've played  All these  So I don't know  Is this worth doing  The list real fast  Ah yeah  We might as well  Go through them  I kind of want to know  I saw this  Okay  This was an intriguing tease  When I read it  On Travis's  What the fuck  Are we going to talk  About tomorrow post  Yeah  And this was on it  And I was like  I'm kind of intrigued  I'd like to know  What they are  Do you remember  A game Anthony  Back in 1976  An arcade game  I don't know  This one whatsoever  Or Death Race  Death Race 
[01:27:00]  Do you remember  Playing Death Race  Based on the great movie  Death Race 2000  With David Carradine  I believe  And Sylvester Stallone  As Machine Gun Joe  For Turbo  Wow  Yes  I believe you drive around  Run people over  For points  Yeah but they were  Just square people  Tiny little square people  Sass  Yeah  Players  Run down  Humanoid gremlins  While avoiding tombstones  Left in their wake  While its graphics  Seemed primitive 
[01:27:30]  By today's standards  It was labeled sick  By countless media outlets  Of course  Earning it the title  Of the world's first  Controversial video game  Wow really  Back in 1976  1992  We fast forward  So there was like  A 16 year gap  In between  Controversial video games  There were no  Controversial games  In the 80's  Missile command  Very scary  Was it?  That stupid missile command 
[01:28:00]  No there were  Controversial games  But just not  Ones that merited  Top 10  Right  I'm sure there were  Some  Well what about  The other one  With the little  Alien invaders  Space invaders  Space invaders  It would go faster  And faster  And you'd freak out  Yeah  Oh it was very  Controversial  Defender  Defender  That stupid centipede  Scared a lot of  Kids  Asteroids  Because it had the word  Ast in it  They thought it was  Very racy  Sexual  And roids  Yeah  Stupid roids 
[01:28:30]  That's where your  Thing is shaped like a penis  And you have to shoot  Semen at the hiney  And knock the roids off it  It's a controversial game  I'm 40 years old  And I just did a fucking  Penis asteroid joke  Yes  You have to shoot  Hemorrhoids off with your cum  And the visual  Was hysterical  What a good comic  Yes  Someone's saying  We did this bit already  How did  How could we do this bit  If this just came out  The  Top 10 most  Controversial video games ever

[01:29:30]  Is what happened  To me  It will just go to  A blank screen  And say  App  Reset  And then you lose  That entire score  And have to start  From zero  I'm not  I'll never start  A brand new  Brickbreaker game  There's no reason to  Yeah why  I'm in Brickbreaker hell  Because I'm an OCD freak  I'm in the middle  Of this game  And I need some  Stupid ending  That I'm never  Going to get  Lose all your  82 lives  And just be happy  With your score  That's not a bad idea  Would you be able  To lose him  I could start  The game off 
[01:30:00]  I could put the  Blackberry on my  Coffee table  And it'll just  Keep shooting men  How about this  It's not a bad idea  Leave it on the  Coffee table  And walk around  Your four bedroom  Penthouse  And go you know  What  Brickbreaker is shit  Life is good  Good point  Good point  You think I would  Be like  Hopkins in Magic  The Blackberry  Would be sitting there  As my lives  Are going down  And I'm starting  To sweat  Like I gotta  Pick that up  I gotta  Fucking do this  I can't let it

[02:09:30]  Oh, I don't think I can do anything.  He grabs the remote like a flan.  Dad, you got to try.  And he's jacking off with it.  He's whacking off with the weak remote.  There you go.  Okay, you got to grab that?  All right.  He gets an asshole.  Ali Baldwin rules.  He's such an idiot.  And I mean that in a very good way.  Let me see.  Oh, well.  Don the Trucker.  Hey, Ope, another problem with the serious music channels, cross-channel promotion.  I'm with Don on this one. 
[02:10:00]  Do they think the people who listen to Speed Metal would be interested in Paul McCartney?  We get some of those on our channel.  Like, wow.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't have an example right now, but some of the promos are like, I don't think our fans would be into that.  I don't know why they're putting this on our channel, but.  Right.  All right.  Ah.  Ah, whatever.  Ah.  Bluesville?  Oh, hmm. 
[02:10:30]  How many, what percentage of our listeners on 202 want Bluesville?  There's some.  Probably, yeah.  Small percent, though.  Not a lot.  Nah, they're more like.  Not a lot.  They're more like alternative rock.  Yeah.  A little octane.  What, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  I just noticed Obama had that fucking thing taken off his nose.  What?  What?  That mole was covered up.  No way.  I just noticed that.  Nah.  Did he?  Nah, impossible.  Really?  That'd be too vain.  The little berry? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  It's there, but it's not dark like it used to be.  Nah, he just, they put a little makeup on it.  Did they?  Yeah.  Teehee.  It's there, but it's not as dark as it used to be.  Are you obsessed with Obama's little nose mole?  I want to eat it.  I want to eat his little nose.  This lemmy thing?  I hate the girls that think those things are sexy.  Ugh.  I don't know.  I hate that.  I like a girl who has like fucking, like eye warts.  You ever see like those eye boogie warts? 
[02:11:30]  No, they're like skin tags on her eyes.  Yeah, they're skin tags on her eyes.  I like when she blinks for her to have, like, her lips are so heavy with skin tags.  It's a fetish of mine.  That doesn't sound sexy at all.  I know.  It makes me really turned on.  All right.  We got more video game talk coming in, but why don't we, uh...  Can I have audio?  Can we hear this until we get back?  I want to hear the Spike Lee TMZ audio.  I don't know what that is.  Yeah, that's a good one, Jimmy.  I just saw it on the prep sheet.  And, uh, we got to talk about strippers. 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  A couple stripping, uh, stripping stories in the news.  Wow.  And what else?  We're not doing the NCAA crap.  No, stop.  I heard that on the news this morning.  I'm like, who?  What?  Where?  I like when it gets down.  I don't know where it is.  When it gets down to 16, then I'm, uh...  Oh, who gives a shit?  Then I'm watching.  I hear, I, I, I hear like, uh, all right, uh, uh, USC or something.  I know where they're from.  Okay.  But then I hear these cities.  It's like, don't be so pompous to think we know where the fuck your stupid school is. 
[02:12:30]  I don't know where that is.  Saints something or...  Makes you mad?  It, it infuriates me that they're so pompous that they think I know where your stupid Midwestern school is.  Do you have an example?  I wish I did, but I'm, they're so...  I'm sure Travis does.  Give me the name of a school that does not have the state or city's name in the initials or anything like that.  Baylor. 
[02:13:00]  Baylor!  That's a perfect one.  Where the fuck is Baylor?  Where is it?  It's actually...  I'd say Kansas.  South Carolina.  Shut up.  I'm going to go with, uh...  Is it?  Baylor.  No, it's California.  I'm going to go with...  You want to really try to do this?  Yes.  What?  Or are you going for the goof answer?  No, let's guess.  Baylor.  I'm going to go with, uh, Virginia.  Tennessee.  Tennessee!  Tennessee!  Unless the Baylor is spelled B-A-I-L, in which case I'd say Washington, D.C. 
[02:13:30]  Baylor.  Baylor University.  Where the fuck is Baylor University, Travis?  Texas.  Texas?  I said that!  That's close to Tennessee, it's close to the T.  Give us another one.  Xavier.  Xavier?  Xavier is in Utah.  Where's Xavier?  No.  Xavier is in, um, um, Louisiana.  I'm going to go with, uh, Virginia.  Who said Cincinnati? 
[02:14:00]  Cincinnati!  Who said Cincinnati?  Johnny Fever.  See?  Boo.  See, no one knows this.  Ant is on to something.  Give us one more before the break.  One more?  All right.  Robert Morris.  Give us an easy one.  Who's he?  Okay.  Rutgers?  I don't know where he lives.  We know Rutgers.  That's Jersey.  Well, yeah, we know that.  Just because we live close to there.  Just because we, yeah, that's the only reason.  Because someone out there is going, Baylor, duh.  Yeah.  But that's because you live close to there.  You live there. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, don't be stupid.  You're right.  Right.  Don't be stupid and say, oh, you know what I mean?  And if you're from Cincinnati and you're listening, shut up.  Yeah.  College.  Exactly.  All right.  Too many N's in your city.  When do you stop writing N's in that fucking city?  Cincinnati.  We got it.  I said N's in.  We know.  We know.  We know.  You wouldn't be a city, but we're mistaken.  I don't even think I could spell Cincinnati if I had to right now.  C-I- wait.  C-I-N-N-C-I-N-N-A-T-T-I.  Yeah, but you just get all confused. 
[02:15:00]  No, C-I-N-I-N-N-N-A-T-I.  Cincinnati.  Wait, C-I-N-C-I-N-N-R-E.  No, C-I-N-R-E.  Yeah.  C-I-N-R-E.  I'm doing spell check.  C-I-N-R-E.  I'm spell check.  C-I-N-R-E-N-N-A-T-T-I.  Cincinnati.  Nope.  Steve, how do you spell Cincinnati?  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  How do you spell Cincinnati?  I know this, too.  No, you don't.  C-I-N.  C-I-N-C.  Okay, everyone else in the free world got that.  All right.  I-N-N-A-T-I.  I-N-A-T-T-I.  No.  There's no two T's.  It's two N's and one T.  Okay.  No.  What?  Steve's right.  Cincinnati.  Okay.  I may suck at everything else.  Yeah, I know.  Did Travis just say Steve's right?  Time code that.  Wow.  What did you say?  I said I may suck at everything else with spelling I can do.  I select that.  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Why don't we do a little, one more.  C-O-C-K-I-N-M-Y-M-O-U-T-H.  Oh, someone said spell dinner.  Kenneth?  I ruin things.  I ruin things.  You ready for one more college basketball town?  Oh, please.  These are basketball.  This is our NCAA break.  Yeah, it's our big break.  All right, let's go.  One more.  Don't say Gonzaga, by the way. 
[02:16:30]  No, I almost did, actually.  I don't know.  Who gives a shit where they are from?  Radford.  Radford?  Oh, my goodness.  Is Radford, is it, um, is that in fucking North Dakota?  Radford.  Radford's in Virginia.  You just keep saying Virginia, as if someone will hit.  Because I think he's tricking me now.  I'll say Radford is...  Illinois!  That's a pretty good choice.  No.  I'd say Radford is in Arizona. 
[02:17:00]  It's in Southern California.  I looked it up.  New Mexico.  Has to be Illinois.  You said Illinois?  Yeah.  Virginia.  You changed your...  I knew he was fucking with me.  What an idiot.  Oh, that sucks.  But you brought the bit together.  Nice.  See?  It was a perfect bit.  Radford.  Everyone pat themselves on the back.  I'm going for Radford.  Perfect good.  Perfect good.  Are they still in it?  No.  Oh.  And just for goof, where is this Gonzaga?  Because every year, they're the underdog. 
[02:17:30]  Gonzaga's playing...  If every year you're the underdog, you're not the underdog anymore.  Spokane?  So, Washington?  What?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Spokane?  Is that how it is?  That's what I say.  Okay.  Spokane, Washington.  I could be wrong.  And he wants to know where, Anthony, Marquette is.  That's a really good one.  Marquette.  Because they do very well in the NCAA, year after year.  They have a pretty good average.  I couldn't fucking... 
[02:18:00]  It could be Hawaii.  Because some of these, like, you know, Radford or whatever, I've never heard of before.  But Marquette, we've all heard of.  Where is Marquette?  Marquette is in Illinois.  How about everyone else guesses while I find where it is?  Marquette.  I'm going to go with one of the Carolinas.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Ohio!  Ooh.  Ooh, I like that.  Hang on.  I have no idea.  Marquette.  Decatur!  We have a very slow internet today. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, why?  I don't know.  What's that?  Because everybody's trying to get through with their college...  Oh, okay.  All right.  Marquette.  I know where Marquette is.  Where?  Milwaukee.  Milwaukee!  Wisconsin.  What?  Milwaukee?  Is someone from Milwaukee?  Yeah, yeah.  Intern David was yelling from the office.  Why?  He knows this shit?  No, he's just yelling from the office.  He knows it pretty well.  He's like a rain man when it comes to NCAA basketball. 
[02:19:00]  Really?  There is not one subject, and I know, and I understand, it's a very big thing.  A lot of people are very interested.  It's every year, March Madness, blah, blah, blah.  I cannot think of one other thing in my life, personally, that is as boring to me as college  fucking basketball.  I despise that it exists.  When I watch it on TV, it all just looks the same.  I can't even watch it on TV. 
[02:19:30]  It, like, CBS had it on.  Oh, yeah.  They got it.  And my cable box resets.  Yeah.  And it automatically goes to Channel 2, CBS in New York.  Mm-hmm.  And I went, like, I actually made a noise.  I went, ah!  Like, I was annoyed that it was on my television for a second.  Yeah.  Until I could get away from it.  I used to be into it.  Not anymore.  Not so much.  Mm-hmm.  I watch, like, the Final Four and all that every year.  No problem.  Even the top 60 will take a little peek, but.  Baylor.  Someone's asking Clemson. 
[02:20:00]  Clemson.  That sounds familiar, but.  That's Ohio.  That is so obvious.  And everyone's so into it when they go to the game.  They paint their faces up.  Like, college sports, oh, they get so into it.  College football's pretty good.  College football is.  It's pretty good, man.  Bigger than pro football.  A lot of scoring.  They, they, the, the, the crowds are huge.  Mm-hmm.  Again, couldn't fucking care what was going on.  Well, you know, like, you don't really watch sports in general. 
[02:20:30]  You'll watch a little baseball, right?  Yeah.  You don't watch hockey, I don't think.  You don't watch.  No.  You don't watch the NBA.  I watch football.  Yeah.  Every so often.  Uh-huh.  Like, once a week I'll watch football.  Even though, no, I know about.  You told me I'm once a week.  I know about the Monday night games and Thursdays every so often.  But, uh, no.  That's kind of funny.  A lot of people say Louis C.K.  I say, uh, Eastside Dave.  The guy from the cable commercials now?  I don't know why.  Oh, Louis C.K., definitely. 
[02:21:00]  I say Fat Eastside Dave with a beard.  Fat Eastside Dave with a, yeah, he kind of does.  I hear Louis C.K. all the time.  I'm like, I don't know.  I see it a little different.  Harrison Ford proposes to Calista Flockhart.  About fucking time.  She gained a little weight.  Yeah.  And I'm serious.  She's up to a buck.  She kind of did.  She's fucking pretty, man.  She's younger than him, I think.  Perhaps.  By eight movies.  They've been together a long time.  What does she do?  She just accepts fucking the old Han Solo cock now. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  She doesn't do anything.  No.  What else is there to do?  And Bruce Willis is getting married again.  He's married now.  He's a dummy.  I saw that.  I've seen him in that fucking Emma in the building.  Wow, is she fantastic.  Wait, is the Emma that used to work at, uh...  No, no, Emma, whatever.  No, no, no.  Emma, whatever is his chick's name.  Emma Watson?  Wait, who are you talking about?  Bruce Willis' new wife is a model named Emma something.  Um, what's her name?  Travis?  I forget.  It was, uh... 
[02:22:00]  There was a rumor that he was also seeing someone from XM.  Well, this is not...  Years ago.  Really?  I have to make it perfectly clear.  It was a rumor.  I heard it.  I didn't know who it was.  Yeah.  I heard he has a very big penis.  Huge, huge, uh...  That's what I've heard, yeah.  Schwung.  Got the big...  Yep.  The big cock.  He told me that in the elevator.  Yeah?  Yep.  I said, hi, I'm a big fan.  He goes, I have a fat cock.  I've got to take care.  Ha, ha, ha.  Would that just be awkward?  No, I'd take out a picture of you and then it. 
[02:22:30]  What would you do if, like, you're in an elevator with a dude and his opening line is,  I've got a big cock.  Prove it, sexy.  I don't know why I'd do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  That would be the longest element ever.  If I was, that is funny, though.  If I was quick on my feet, I'd say, perfect, I have a deep asshole.  Just make him uncomfortable.  Try to, like, throw it back in his face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Literally, yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break and we'll do some things. 
[02:23:00]  We have to go to duty.  Jimmy wants to hear the Spike Lee thing.  We'll do that.  Yes.  McLovin drops the F-bomb on Jimmy Kimmel.  If you haven't heard yet, it's pretty good.  I don't want to hear that.  Quick and easy.  More and more cursing going on on regular TV.  Like, they're doing a little something.  You know what it is?  The economy's so bad that people aren't really paying much attention now.  Right.  Radio ought to take that and run with it, but they're just not.  You know, let out some slack.  Right.  Villanova. 
[02:23:30]  Purdue.  Purdue's in Illinois.  No, Purdue is in Chatsworth, California.  No, wait, that's where AVN headquarters is.  Villanova.  You look at that.  Weep, weep, weep. 
[02:24:00]  Weep, weep.  Weep, weep.  Weep. 
[02:24:30]  Weep.  A little mouse guitar.  Rocks.  Is that a little whammy bar right there, you think?  Oh, yeah.  What happened to the whammy bar?  Don't see it much.  Don't see it much.  Occasionally.  Hopi and Anthony.  I don't know.  I think we lost Jimmy.  He went to go take a pee-pee, and what happened?  He got raped.  Got caught near the glory hole.  Yeah, he's arrested, tapping his foot under the stall. 
[02:25:00]  It's a big commotion.  I don't know.  Yeah.  We'll get some news.  Gossip Girl Monday on CW.  It's like the hugest show on TV, but for what, broads, I guess?  What's the Gossip Girl all about there, Travis?  One Tree Hill, all new.  I'd ask Danny, but he took a day to this.  It's up to you.  What's Gossip Girl's about?  I think it's just...  Iraq probably knows.  Eric, do you know?  For real.  Do you know, right?  No, I don't know.  I know 90210. 
[02:25:30]  I don't know.  Wow.  One Tree Hill.  One Tree Hill, you know that?  They're all the same, though.  That's what it seems to me like, like, I don't know.  I don't want to sound like a...  Of course Sam knows what Gossip Girl's is about.  Sam knows.  What's Gossip Girl's about?  It's like following young 20-somethings in New York City, but it's not like a reality  show.  It's a fiction show, and it's almost like her inner monologue.  It's like a diary, and she signs everything, XOXO, Gossip Girl. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, it's, you know...  Signs everything what?  Like, that's the way the episodes end.  Who watches this show?  Chicks or dudes?  Chicks mainly.  No dude would watch this.  Who knows?  We might just be officially old.  I don't watch it as much as I do, say, like, 90210 or something like that.  We are officially old.  I think we're officially old.  We can't make believe we're young anymore.  But I swear to you, I would never have watched this in my wildest fucking hallucinations in my teens.  I would never watch Gossip Girl. 
[02:26:30]  Gossip Girl, Sam.  Have you seen the new 90210?  No, why would I?  No, I didn't watch the old one.  I didn't see the old one.  The old one stunk.  Yeah, but the new one's better.  Although Michael from The Wires is like the star of the show, I hear.  Yep, and Jenny Garth is on it from the original.  Oh, wonderful.  And Shannon Doherty pops up here and there.  Great.  Why would I want to watch that?  Just to follow the storylines, stuff like that.  No, it's a soap opera, but it's in film and it's on at night instead of video in the daytime. 
[02:27:00]  But it's the same shit.  It's not like a soap opera.  It's like Days of Our Lives or General Hospital.  E-Rock tried to sell it, and I give him an A for effort.  He goes, it's filled with hot high school chicks.  Great.  How about you hang outside of real high school?  At least I'm honest, E-Rock watches it because he falls into the storylines,  and then he wants to impress the guys by saying, I watch it for the chicks.  That's the only watchful show for the chicks anyone can ever do.  It never works.  Is I watch it for the girls. 
[02:27:30]  You know what I would watch for the girls, and I have watched for the girls?  That goddamn high school and college cheerleading competitions.  It's the only thing you could actually go, you know, yeah, I've watched that.  Because I love cheerleading.  No.  Because they throw fucking high school girls around.  Where's the storyline?  The cheerleading.  I don't need a storyline.  I just need fucking cheerleaders.  Can I ask you something?  The cheerleading outfit.  Yeah.  The cheerleaders outfit.  Uh-huh.  Sexy?  Nowadays, in the competitions, they've gotten better. 
[02:28:00]  Fuck no.  The old, it's still the old wool sweater one with the fucking skirt that's too long.  Right.  That's bullshit.  But they sexy it up now for these competitions.  Lingerie, when the skirt goes flying up over their heads?  Yeah.  Totally nude, as a matter of fact.  Totally nude.  Some of the schools, like Bryant University or whatever.  I have no idea.  I'm going to call back to the basketball bit.  Abu.  Abu.  Abu. 
[02:28:30]  I told you there was a rumor in my high school that one of the cheerleaders didn't wear the  panties underneath.  Oh, I was a guy or something.  No, no.  But we all couldn't figure out if that was what was happening, because you would get  like a quick glimpse.  Yeah.  But this rumor was so strong in my high school when I was there.  And I don't know to this day if it was true or not.  Sometimes.  And we would check her out.  But she didn't get the really good moves where the skirt would pop up enough for you  to know for sure.  You've got to get the one that they throw up in the air, and her skirt blows up. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  And if she's wearing black panties sometimes, it would look like a triangle of big pube.  A triangle of death.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hey, what are they showing a cheerleader for?  That's my computer.  Oh, good.  I thought it was the news.  It's Travis News.  Travis News on that big screen.  Why are you showing that?  Is that the kind of outfit that's not sexy?  That's not sexy.  Do you have any of those rumors in your high school?  Some good, solid rumor?  Uh, no.  This was a good one.  This one, she was a cheerleader for the basketball team, and we just could not figure it out. 
[02:29:30]  But people swore it was true.  It was, um, no, no big rumors.  I was in lust with one of the cheerleaders.  This little red-haired cheerleader girl.  Well, now Travis is finding the sexy cheerleader.  Yes, I know.  That is ridiculous.  No high school in America has that as their official uniform, you idiot.  You put on, you put, what'd you put on high heel fucking sneakers on?  Travis is an idiot. 
[02:30:00]  What did you put in the, uh, search engine?  Cheerleader outfit.  See, that ain't gonna work.  That's not gonna get you actual pictures.  Danny knows how to search.  No, see.  He would put in high school cheerleader competition.  No, just put in.  And, and, and you would come up with, like, the teams.  Danny's not here.  We have different ways to do it.  But I think it's hilarious.  Of course.  Dan, the good way and Travis's way.  I think it's hilarious, though.  He's showing us a picture, like, this could possibly be an outfit somewhere.  Never.  The tornado cheerleaders weren't wearing that shit. 
[02:30:30]  It's on the internet.  Danny is so good at that job.  Oh, yeah.  I miss Danny.  Me too.  Hang on.  I wish he was back today.  He is probably the best internet searcher guy I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Doesn't matter what you talk about, that guy can find it on the internet.  Danny has a lot of help.  Whose ass is that, by the way?  Oh, it's about, oh.  Wait, what happened?  He goes, Danny has a lot of help.  Oh, jeez.  Well, is somebody behind the scenes getting a little angry?  I'm not angry at all.  Someone is saying the rumor is Bravo Sierra. 
[02:31:00]  I don't know if that dude went to my high school.  Who is this dude?  Who, Bravo Sierra?  Did you ever have one of those rumors in your high school, Sam?  Some sexy rumor?  I don't think so.  All right.  Who's the girl on top?  Where?  Jimmy, what happened to you?  Oh, boy, that was a good one.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll see a little something going on there.  I like when you can see.  If you can't see hair, I like seeing ligament.  I like seeing that ligament.  That fucking main thigh ligament that you know just points directly to the fucking ground zero of pleasure. 
[02:31:30]  Jesus.  The ligament.  See, cheerleader 07 competition.  Yeah.  Oh, now we're talking.  The uniforms stink on ice, but that's good.  Look at that.  Imagine just being thrown into that.  Imagine being behind them.  I would.  Yeah.  Because they're all bending forward.  Jimmy, cheerleading outfit.  Hot?  Sexy?  Not that one in particular.  The one they're wearing now is not. 
[02:32:00]  No, it's not.  In general, though, I say no.  Sure, some of it is because you're seeing up a skirt or whatever.  It's harder now because we're so desensitized because of porn and stuff like that.  But it's like the idea of a cheerleading outfit or Catholic school outfit, it's kind of innocence mixed with seeing up the skirt, which is very sexy.  That's a fat pussy to my life.  Yeah.  We're in the middle of a Gossip Girl discussion, Jimmy.  Yes, you're talking about Gossip Girl.  Because we talk about only the cool shows on TV.  Sam's a big fan of the Gossip Girl, Jimmy.  Oh, good. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Do you guys watch Secret Life of the American Team?  That show, I've never seen.  It's on ABC Family on Mondays.  ABC Family?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a good show.  Do you watch this?  Yeah.  What is it about?  Well, it's following this girl in the beginning of season one, even though she's the good girl and was a virgin, ended up getting pregnant at camp.  And it's kind of following how she has to deal with that being in high school and everything.  You have time to watch so many shows.  Well, I mean, it's on at 8 o'clock. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, but isn't everything on at 8 o'clock?  What else am I going to watch?  Gossip Girl and everything else.  Yeah, well, I started watching Secret Life of the American Team instead of Gossip Girl.  What is wrong with that?  Secret Life of the American Team.  You're like a teenage chick.  Yeah, you are.  You're like a little teen bitch in a black man's body.  Well, these shows are good shows.  No, they're not.  And, I mean, it keeps me wrapped up.  It keeps me wanting to watch more.  You see Bromance?  What's the one?  Tool Academy?  Well, Tool Academy is over. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, unfortunately.  I started watching Tough Love.  That's a new one on VH1.  Tells Tough Love.  It's where this guy whose mother and him run like a matchmaking company, he's now getting  a group of girls, like eight girls, who are bad at finding boyfriends, and he's showing  them exactly what they're doing wrong.  And he's going to help them find the perfect match.  I haven't watched anything on regular television in, I can't even tell you how long.  You've got to check some of these shows out. 
[02:34:00]  No, it's all lost.  That's it.  It's all about movies and lost.  What about He's Bowning Down?  I would love to.  I'll call Danny McBride.  You've had him on a couple times.  I've got to DVR it.  You've got to check out He's Bowning Down.  Because I'm not.  I will DVR it.  It's a good show.  How about The Wire?  You've got to get back into him.  Well, that's video.  Yeah, yeah.  That's video.  It'll grab you.  Season 2 knocked you out.  Season 2 knocks a lot of people out.  I only bought the first two seasons.  You've got to get season 3.  I've got to get season 3 now.  How many episodes did you get through in season 2? 
[02:34:30]  Four.  Just keep, go back to it.  It'll grab you.  I'm telling you.  It'll grab you.  It'll roll you right into season 3.  Oh, I know.  2 slows everybody down.  2 was, I think, a mistake.  No, it was only because it was the first character switch.  By 3, you know it's coming.  By 4, it was a huge switch.  But 2 is the first time it happened.  Yeah, but...  Zoom in on that chick on the right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's the slut.  Of what?  Secret Life of the American Teen.  I thought that's what we were talking about.  No.  I thought that was what we were talking about.  We really tried to move on to the whole show, like The Wire. 
[02:35:00]  What's her name, Sam?  I'm not good with the names, but I'll tell you who they are as to the roles they fill.  What about the girl, uh...  Yeah, that's the slut?  She looks sleep with whoever.  She looked better in the other picture.  What happened?  Yeah, that's not too good.  Let me say hi to Brendan.  Brendan.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, man.  Hey, um, whatever faggot-ass show Sam's talking about right now, I walked in one day and my  girlfriend was watching it. 
[02:35:30]  Okay, shut up.  And Molly Newall is the star of that show.  You know the cast because you accidentally walked in on your girlfriend.  Shut up.  At least admit that you watch it.  I watched it.  I had to sit there and watch it if I wanted to get some with her.  But Molly Newall...  Oh, yeah, I was just trying to get some.  I watch it for the chicks.  Oh, I'm just having to...  My girlfriend only makes out with me if I watch her show.  Jeff, you watch the show.  You just watch it.  No, no.  I don't even know the name of the damn show.  Then how do you know the cast?  How do you know the cast of a show without knowing the name?  How did you know Molly Newall was in the show if you didn't know the name of the show? 
[02:36:00]  You watch it.  You just watch the show.  I was with you at Molly Anthony.  Good point, sir.  Me and you do the same thing on Mondays.  We do the same thing on Monday nights.  What does that say?  We watch Secret Life of the American Team.  We don't do it in the same house, but we're both watching it.  I don't even know if it's on Monday nights.  You just know the cast.  You just know Molly Newall is one of the supporting characters in the show.  But you don't know what the show's title is or what time it's on.  No, I came home Saturday morning. 
[02:36:30]  You don't.  You're lying.  She plays it.  I'm lying.  You admitted it.  He just said he's lying.  Yeah, he is.  I watch 90210.  I'll admit that.  For the chicks, man.  For the chicks, I swear.  Shut up.  I'll watch it for the pot lines.  Like, eat.  Rock.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Mark in Nebraska.  Mark.  Mark.  Hey, Mark.  You're on.  Mark.  He's got a good one. 
[02:37:00]  Mark.  He has.  He has no idea that he's on the air.  Mark, it says a retard brings a whore home in Sam's gay show.  Is this true, Sam?  How is it a gay show?  Everybody knows all the plot lines.  Obviously, I'm talking to people who watch the show with me.  But yes.  The retard.  In what show now?  Which gay show?  Secret Life of the American Teen.  Okay, not to be confused with your other gay show, Gossip Girl.  Right.  Realtard?  Yeah, they get a real Down syndrome kid.  Wow.  Tell you the kid with Down syndrome.  And he hires a prostitute, but he just talks to her because he doesn't know.  Right.  Well, he knows.  What a dummy. 
[02:37:30]  He paid.  But they can't go all in with the storyline.  But now he's dating a black chick who also has Down syndrome.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  I might have to check this out for the chicks.  Just for the chicks.  Just for the chicks, man.  We've come a long way, huh?  Yeah.  Since I love Lucy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was I love Goofy.  Three idiot shoot.  Right.  Three brain cells. 
[02:38:00]  Pioneered.  I dare say the sitcom has grown up, huh, Sam?  What's with the prego chick?  So, see, this is the star of the show.  Oh, really?  She's just the good girl, the girl next door.  Wait, it's a show that's cast.  I thought it was at least a reality show.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The cast?  It's a drama.  It's a real show.  If it's a reality show, maybe I would take a look.  She makes one mistake, and all of a sudden she's pregnant.  Yeah.  And we have to figure out if she can.  Yeah.  What can a dick put in you is not a mistake?  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  No, let's slow down there.  No.  Okay.  I hate to jump on your defense.  She made a mistake.  So, she, one time, one time only, she got pregnant, and now she's going through with having the kid.  Yeah, see, the guy in the blue shirt is Ricky, who's really a bad guy, and he's the one who impregnated her.  All right, we're looking at a cast of six.  Yeah.  Go from left to right as fast as we can.  Okay, so the guy in the white hoodie there, he's like the jock, but he's also a Christian, so he's a virgin.  Yeah.  He used to date the blonde girl standing next to him, who's also a Christian. 
[02:39:00]  But she likes the cock now.  Yeah, she broke up with him.  Really?  Yeah, and started going after the bad guy who's standing next to her, Ricky.  But Ricky impregnated the other chick who's the star of the show.  Do you know her name?  No, I remember her name.  But she's the pregnant woman.  But she's pregnant, and she's the star.  That bitch has huge feet, though.  Jesus, does she address how big her fucking feet are in the show?  No, that's never come on.  Stormtrooper feet.  Now, the guy next to her is gay.  No, he's not gay.  He's in love with her.  But she's pregnant with that guy's baby.  And he's a good guy. 
[02:39:30]  Exactly.  Punch her in the stomach.  Yeah.  And then finally, the girl at the end is the whore.  And she's brushing with maybe turning into a good girl.  Who is she fucked?  Oh, she definitely fucked the guy in the blue.  She tried to fuck the guy in the white.  The bad guy and the Christian guy.  She tried to.  Wow.  She's a slut, all right.  She's been sleeping with her half-brother lately.  Oh, I kind of like the show.  Blood half-brother?  No, not by blood.  Incessant, retards.  How do you not love the show? 
[02:40:00]  I stand corrected.  It can't go all in.  It's not a blood half-brother.  Well, because she was put up for adoption.  And then she found her father.  And so her father's son through marriage is the one that she's sleeping with.  Sam, while you're at it, Jersey Matt wants to know if you could let us know what the latest title is in Oprah's book club.  I don't watch Oprah.  Let's say hi to, let's say hi to Ken and Moho.  Ken and Moho.  Hey, Sam, I'm very upset. 
[02:40:30]  You're spoiling the show for me.  I have it all DVR, and I'm waiting for a good chance to watch it all in one great burst.  And you're fucking spoiling everything.  There was a marathon this weekend.  You should have checked that out.  Oh, there was?  Yeah, because I think tonight's the season finale of season two.  That's a shame, because I was watching Band of Brothers.  Yeah.  For the chicks.  For the chicks and the guns, man.  That's it.  Nothing better than a marathon, huh?  Yeah.  That's how I got hooked on this show.  I thought it was stupid, and then I sat down to watch one episode, and all of a sudden I've seen the whole first season.  Sam, one of your fans calling in. 
[02:41:00]  We've got Todd in Pittsburgh.  Todd.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  So Sam's wrong.  Sam missed some details that are kind of important to the story.  What's that?  The young Christian jock that was dating the blonde girl actually did have sex with the whore, and he regretted it while he was dating the blonde girl, and regretted it.  And now, in last night's episode, the blonde is actually trying to get back with the jock, and the jock was dating a black girl, and the black girl was the brother of some mentor kid that he was mentoring. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, it's a fantastic storyline.  Well, is the jock the guy in the white?  Yes.  And the black girl was older, but they broke up.  Now, do girls fuck him because they think he's Jim J. Bullock?  That hasn't come up.  Well, you thought.  The good girl is Amy, right?  Yeah, Amy.  That's her name.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Amy Juergens.  Yeah.  Ah.  Who's the girl with the cum belly?  That's Amy.  That's Amy.  Yes.  She should tell people she just drank a lot of cum, and that's what happened. 
[02:42:00]  She's retaining cum.  That'd be much hotter if you had a cum belly.  By the way, Sam, they're all calling you dumb.  It's not a half-brother.  It's a step-brother.  Half-step-brother.  All right.  Shut up, boy.  Who cares?  Shut up.  Another great thing about the writing of the show, too, is how they take every scene, it's like they sit down in the writer's meeting and say,  what word can we beat into the ground in this episode, and they'll take that word and they'll be within the script like 7,000 times for that episode.  Make a great drinking game. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  Thank you, Todd.  I'm just watching great drinking games.  Great drinking game, man.  We sit around with the guys that drink beers and shit.  Wolf down shots when something happens on the show.  Normally, it'd be a fucking fag show, but when you got these drinks, man, it's fucking awesome.  Yeah, but we drink cum for the drinking game.  Cum drinks.  It's a big bukkake fest in our man cave.  We should have had Sam grow the beard a lot earlier.  He's a bit manlier.  Yeah, he is. 
[02:43:00]  You're fighting back now.  I think it's the beard that's doing it.  We're forcing him to grow like a two-week beard so Robert Kelly stops raping him.  Yeah, Bob Kelly's going to come back in here.  I'm breaking up with him.  Oh, that'll be a fucking tragic day for Bobby.  That's right.  That'll be some more terrific radio.  Yeah.  Let me say how to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Sean.  I guess Sam's won me over.  I guess I'm going to have to tell my daughters who are 15 and 8 to scoot over tonight and make room for daddy. 
[02:43:30]  We're watching whatever that girly shit is Sam watches.  Maybe you should be watching shows with your kids.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Besides, your 8-year-old is watching shows about teenagers getting pregnant.  What do you think is going to happen?  Any other shows we should be taking a peek at there, Sam?  Well...  While we have you in here?  Tough Love.  I've been watching Hell's Kitchen, but that's a manly show.  With Chef Gordon Ramsay.  Yeah, he gets angry.  I've been guilty of watching that one.  That's a good one.  I've watched that. 
[02:44:00]  And Kitchen Nightmares is good, too.  I don't know.  No?  One fucking cooking show.  Why do I need two cooking shows?  Chef Gordon Ramsay's on both of them.  Then, even more so, then.  Why would I need two?  Do you watch the cake show?  Oh, yeah.  Ace of Cakes.  No, I've heard of Ace of Cakes.  What is it called?  Ace of Cakes.  Yeah, Ace of Cakes.  Who's watching that?  Ace of Cakes is pretty impressive.  It is.  They make the cake into, like, the Taj Mahal or something.  I would like a nice cake.  How the fuck do they do that?  From Charm City Cakes.  I saw one.  They made a cake.  Wait, I don't know.  I swear to God.  From where? 
[02:44:30]  Charm City Cakes.  Duff from Charm City Cakes.  He makes all these cakes.  He made one airplane cake, and he stuck, like, firecrackers in the engine.  Did he throw it into a fucking cemetery in Montana?  Get E-Rock in here, because he just said...  Cake?  He goes, smoke cake, and he goes, I'll lunge into the DVDs.  What?  You watch this stupid show?  You have this on DVD?  Of course he does.  What?  It was a special Target exclusive.  Dude, I wouldn't give a shit if they paid you to take the fucking DVDs out of the store. 
[02:45:00]  Why would you have Ace of Cakes?  Because it was a Target exclusive.  I got turned on to the show.  You'd sit there.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Let me paint a picture.  You're sitting there going like, holy shit.  Look what he's doing with that fucking cake pan.  I got to watch that at least 20 times.  Yeah, I got it on DVD.  Rewind.  Rewind.  Watch the icing.  Look, I'm guilty for taking a peek, but I wouldn't go and get the box set. 
[02:45:30]  That's how I started watching the show.  I bought it on DVD.  You just saw it, but without watching it?  No, I got to check this out.  Your DVD collection must just be fantastic, but you got the likes of...  Oh, it's the best.  ...Ace of Cakes in it.  Ace of Cakes is on every day.  I never saw it until I was told to buy the DVDs, so I bought them when I watched them.  You're told to buy the DVDs now.  Ah, now he's told to buy it.  Who told you?  My chick made me do it.  No, his stomach told him.  No, it wasn't.  It wasn't my chick.  What's your favorite cake that the guy made? 
[02:46:00]  They did one for Leno.  They did a big sports car cake.  See, he's trying to bond with Jimmy right there.  Yes, I am.  That was an attempt at, like, I watch it, they're goofing on.  All right, well, you know, you might know a guy named Leno, Jim.  Which one sent you on the fucking biggest food binge?  Which cake sent you on a binge?  One of them did.  Which one?  No.  Sent you on a sweet binge?  Could you find some of these Ace of Cakes, Travis?  Yeah.  I want to hear a little dialogue from Ace of Cakes. 
[02:46:30]  It's a good show.  It's not a good show.  Look, they made a cake and it looks just like a sandwich.  Shut it.  Let's fucking eat it.  I'm sure they're delicious.  They are probably the most inedible cakes.  It's like plastic.  Plastic on them.  That fucking cake that we got at the station.  Look at the castle.  No, that one was edible.  Look at the enchanted castle.  That's not a cake, it's a sculpture.  That's in the middle of a train set.  That's a cake.  You also have to realize what makes it a show is the human drama element of, you know, you  have to make a deadline.  You all have to work together in Charm City Cakes. 
[02:47:00]  Charm City Cakes.  Charm City Cakes.  Where is Charm City Cakes?  I think it's in St. Louis, but I'm not positive.  It's like American Chopper, but for cakes.  Do they ship them?  Oh, just like it.  Hey, that's a great way to sell a show, though.  American Chopper with cakes.  Do they ship cakes?  They'll put it in a van.  They've had to put the cake in a van and drive it themselves, but I don't see how you can  pack it up.  And that gets scary because you don't know if the cake's going to make it in one case 
[02:47:30]  to the destination.  Yeah, because you don't know if it's going to fall down.  You hit one speed bump.  Oh, shit.  They just spent an hour doing that cake.  Yeah.  And this is a huge thing.  Cakes are very tricky to ship.  Oh, no.  Did you know that, Samuel?  No, I had no idea.  Ted, the cake maker?  I have my own cake business, Gregory.  I make ice cream cakes.  Oh, nice.  I ship them all over the country.  That must be hard in the refrigerated trucks.  I know what?  I use UPS ground.  You'll get your cake within five days or it's on old ten. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  You must pay for a lot of cakes.  I have, yes.  That's a good point, Anthony.  I need to change my guarantee.  People are always like, there's just a soupy cardboard box.  My party's ruined, Ted.  Rude.  Nice.  Ted's a jerk off.  Ronnie B. hates those cakes, according to this.  Why would he ship them?  Ronnie B. says he hates these cakes because he wants a cake without Play-Doh on top. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's like.  It's too much of that sculpting stuff.  But it's edible.  It's sugary.  Oh, it's horrible tasting.  Flavored.  Oh, let's go to Dave.  You know what?  We've picked some good subjects today.  The phone's now lit again.  Dave, yes.  Dave, it's you.  What's up with the phone?  Yeah, you, Dave.  Yeah.  Hey, tonight is John and Kate Plus 8 break up.  Why are we talking about anything else?  Are they really breaking up, Sam?  There's just rumors going around that John and Kate Plus 8 are breaking up. 
[02:49:00]  This guy, the rumor is.  What?  He's messing around on her.  I read it in the gossip magazines.  That's the rumor.  Was he fucking a girl with a vagina smaller than the Batcave?  The rumor is that John, one star of John and Kate Plus 8.  Yes.  Uh, is, uh, fooling around with a, like a, like a co-ed.  A college girl?  A college girl.  I find it hard to believe it, though.  I don't think a man would.  How the fuck you get that done with eight kids at home?  Because all the college girls watch John and Kate Plus 8. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, true.  You think, well, he got the new hair and now he's banging some college bro.  Of course.  I like seeing this stereotype just being torn apart on Maury today.  Well, what happened?  Look at the girlfriend and the boyfriend.  Yeah.  It's a giant fat white chick with a skinny Urkel-looking black guy.  It looks like Drew Boogie.  Oh, my God.  What a monster she is.  I know, I'm sorry, Drew.  Oh, what a beast.  And she's yelling at him like she's all that. 
[02:50:00]  She has that.  I think she thinks she's all that.  What's that fat girl shirt she has that has, like, the little band around the middle?  Like, uh, it's like.  A muumuu.  Is that a muumuu?  It's awful.  A muumuu with a little, uh.  Yeah, there is.  There's, like, a little tie thing in the middle.  It's slimming.  It's not.  You know what would be slimming?  If she was, if she stood in front of outer space.  That would be slimming.  Outer space is slimming on you.  If she carried, like, a background of space and planets, she would look terrific. 
[02:50:30]  You know, Duff once made a bumper car cake?  No.  And all the cars were little cakes.  That sounds like a little fun.  Wow.  So, like.  That's terrific.  The whole cake was the, like, thing that you drive around the bumper cars.  And each bumper car gives a fuck.  Oh.  Those are easy.  Do you know how I'll write little inscriptions on the cakes?  Happy birthday, Merle.  Merle?  Yes, but no one ever sees it because they melt.  Yes. 
[02:51:00]  Perhaps you need a refrigerated truck again.  I don't have that kind of money, Anthony.  UPS crowd.  Five days or less for it's not old Ted.  But, see, you're paying now because you've got to pay for the cake that gets there melted.  So, why don't you just get refrigerated trucks?  Point taken.  Does the ice cream cake leak out of the box?  Yes, it does.  I've been getting a lot of complaints that they're just flat, soupy boxes that aren't delicious, though.  They have to say that in fairness. 
[02:51:30]  In fairness.  Of course they would.  I can't deny the deliciousness of Theodore's cakes.  Yeah, that's what's called Theodore's cake emporium.  Oh, it's an emporium.  That's right.  Of course it has to be.  You think it, I'll bake it.  That's my motto.  It's not a very good one.  It doesn't rhyme.  I know it doesn't.  I thought it did.  I was tired.  Is there a website?  Yes, it is.  It's Theodore's cake emporium with a good guarantee dot com.  You've got to work on your website addresses, too. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  They're too short.  They have to be a lot longer to roll off the tongue.  At least you got the dot com.  Yes, I don't know.  I meant to say dot org.  I know.  Dot com mistaken.  That's why I went back there.  That's why I went back there.  You're right.  Dot org.  Dot UK.  I have that one, too.  Lucky you.  Notice the best show on TV that I can't get up here, and it's on the Philly cable system.  I think it's called Three Sheets. 
[02:52:30]  Three Sheets.  Maybe someone can help me out with this, or we can get a little synopsis.  Dude travels the world.  Me and two friends wearing a costume.  Or where Anthony is in relation to the wind when he's driving.  I think it's called Three Sheets, and this dude, what a brilliant idea for his show.  He travels the world and just gets fucked up, because they have all sorts of drinking traditions 
[02:53:00]  all over the world.  Sure they do.  Just drinking horrific stuff that just tastes awful.  The guy's name is Zane Lamprey.  Is it?  Yeah.  I'm not sure.  Is it?  I guess it is.  Zane, yeah.  It's on Mojo.  Mojo.  I, I, there's too many, there's too many shows on TV.  There's too many shows.  Not a lot, not a lot of them are worth watching.  No.  Cakes.  Just pick out one of the ones we talked about and see if you like it. 
[02:53:30]  When we've reached the point where there's a show about cakes.  You gotta see these cakes.  I don't know.  You can't get over this one, huh?  There's too much, yes, I can't get over the cake show.  Look at the guy, he has baked cake on his knuckles.  Come on.  He's cool.  Dude, stop it.  That is not the friggin' guy.  He looks like an alternative rock jock.  Yeah, that's Duff.  Now he's baking cakes.  Looks like fucking Steve, who was still in the foundry.  Yes.  Yes.  Bake cake.  Ace of Cakes.  They got the cool logo, too.  Come on. 
[02:54:00]  And then, who's the old fucking broad with the retard bangs in the back?  Okay, well, that's one of his staff members.  Those are the, where do they work?  Charm City Cakes.  Charm, Charm City Cakes.  What's Charm City, by the way?  It's the name of the cake shop.  Where are they?  I think they're in St. Louis, but I'm not positive.  St. Lou?  I think so.  St. Lou.  So I'm going to say, in the best Ace of Cakes shows, are the ones where the cakes fall apart.  What happens there?  Because the cakes...  Oh, wow.  The drama.  The, oh, fuck.  Are they going to be able to put it together and tie it to the function? 
[02:54:30]  Holy shit.  Well, but you don't want to see that happen.  No.  Because that happens.  I don't want to see it.  They spend a lot of time building these cakes, and sometimes in transport, the cakes fall  apart, and then it's an emergency to put it back together.  But then it gets so stressful.  How do they handle that, Samuel?  I tend to just not answer the emails.  Well, they try to fix the cake as quick as possible.  Oh!  I had to do that one time.  I had to fly to Southern California, and then re-freeze it and hand it to the van. 
[02:55:00]  Save myself 14 buckaroos.  Oh, my God.  Three Sheets is not on the air anymore, because Mojo went away.  I did not know that.  I haven't seen the Three Sheets in a while.  What's Donnie Tackles?  Donnie or something like that?  Tackles a globe?  I don't know anything about that.  That sounds like one of those travel channel shows.  I stay away from that.  But explain it.  Oh, you stay away from the travel channel, do you? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  It's not interesting.  No, no.  Not enough girls on there.  Not enough chicks.  Just trying to find some chicks, and I don't see any on the travel channel.  You know, I saw an episode of Axeman, which, of course, is the logging guys.  It was a marathon yesterday.  Oh, was there?  Yes.  We were supposed to have those guys on.  Yeah, I know.  I saw the trailer for it, and it's like, I knew from the trailer that they were over-dramatizing 
[02:56:00]  what was happening on the show.  Like, every so often, something kind of almost dangerous happens, but for the most part,  they're just cutting down trees.  Every single episode emphasizes that there's a possibility that someone could either get  hit with a log or hit with a crane.  Yes.  Those are the dangers.  Those are the big dangers, but it doesn't happen.  And it's two seasons worth.  And in the trailer, you hear like, oh my God!  Oh!  Oh!  Really?  The one...  And nothing happens.  The one episode I watched, they had too many logs coming down on one of those. 
[02:56:30]  Jimmy had that problem just before we came back from last break.  Too many logs.  My problem is normally not enough.  There's no such thing as too many logs.  There's the one little skinny one that comes out.  It's like, what did you eat?  What is that?  Don't eat Thai food and then come over here.  What did I have?  An earthworm?  Exactly.  Stop eating a little...  I couldn't think of a skinnier thing than earthworms.  As long as you shut up.  As I should have.  So you don't like the log show? 
[02:57:00]  No, another one that over-dramatizes what's really happening and stuff.  Did you watch the Ice Road Truckers?  Nope.  Didn't watch that.  They all came off of...  Ice Road Truckers.  That show rules.  It was good for a couple episodes.  No, two seasons worth.  You watched two seasons worth?  Every episode, yep.  Deadliest Catch.  They all came off of Deadliest Catch.  It was like, all right, they got this job that is legitimately fucking dangerous.  You're in freezing cold waters trying to find, like, crabs.  Stupid crabs. 
[02:57:30]  Crabs.  And ships are sinking and people are dying.  Right.  And then they just were like, okay, that show's got a good buzz.  What other jobs are dangerous?  And then let's film them.  It's an Ice Road Truck.  It's like a boat, except it's a truck.  And it's on the ice.  Imagine if the ice broke.  It's not going to break down.  But it didn't.  It sank.  But it doesn't.  Did one truck go through the ice?  No, but it could.  No, because they go at a certain time of year when it's frozen.  But the ice roads are so slick. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, but they know how to drive them.  It's not like that.  If they just gave them to the fucking gossip girls.  Right.  And gave them the trucks and said, drive this.  That would be interesting, perhaps.  But the cabs of the trucks get so cold.  There's heat.  Well, sometimes they run out of the heat.  I saw one episode where the guy did run out of heat.  How do you run out of heat?  Well, I stopped working.  Your heater breaks?  I don't know.  He run like he's got a set amount of heat.  And they had to rescue him.  That he can use.  Yeah, and one guy's truck, he had to fix an axle or something.  And he went out to fix it. 
[02:58:30]  And he could only work on it for like 20 minutes.  And then he almost got frostbite.  Then what happened?  Almost.  Yeah, they didn't call someone.  It's so goddamn cold.  The car club.  And then he just called someone and they rescued him?  Yeah, but it took forever because it's so cold and there's not that many people there.  There's time running out, Sam.  Yeah, and plus, they got to get to...  Hypothermia is setting in.  I always hate that.  Time was running out.  Time was of the essence.  Was it?  Hypothermia was setting in.  Was it?  And they're trying to make money for their families.  They got to get the diamond supplies to the diamond manufacturers in time. 
[02:59:00]  They're trying to get to De Beers in time.  De Beers?  They're trying to have some beers?  No.  It's a man's show.  Nice.  I like that.  Yeah.  What about the chick angles, Sam?  Any chicks on that show?  They got some chick truckers?  There's no chicks on it, but sometimes, like every time the ice cracks, I do a shot with  my bros.  Ah, drinking game.  All these shows, by the way, I think they're saying the same thing here.  All these shows should be a one-hour special.  No.  Even like Deadliest Catch.  One hour...  What?  Footer makes a great point. 
[02:59:30]  I watched this piece of shit show.  All right, let's go to Footer.  I watched two episodes of this piece of shit show.  Footer.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, you ever see that Operation Repo?  Yep.  Obviously, you took the call.  Did I miss something?  No, no.  We're just having fun in the studio.  Nothing about you, Flitter.  The first couple of fucking episodes, it kind of had me a little bit.  Yeah.  And then I noticed there's a little fucking disclaimer.  Like, they didn't put into, like, the middle of the season. 
[03:00:00]  It says it's all, like, recreated or whatever they say.  How fucking annoying.  It's fucking fake.  Hey, you know what?  I'm watching this show.  Why do they have to film fake shit?  I have no idea.  First of all, the thing that tipped me off at first was no one's face was blurred out.  And they're constantly coming in contact with the people's cars that they're repoing, which barely ever happens.  Right.  They take the fucking car. 
[03:00:30]  Some guy goes to the door and goes, we took your fucking car.  And then there's some violence that happens.  Like, one guy came out with a baseball bat on this one episode.  And this big fucking bruiser that works for the repo company took the bat from the guy.  And there's, like, there's, like, there's a big standoff.  And the people that their car's being removed about never acknowledge the camera.  They, like, they're just kind of walking around.  That sucks.  And I was like, this show is fucking fake.  And, yo, Em, what about when they, like, the big guy is going, like, one time some dude goes to, like, take a swing at him. 
[03:01:00]  And the guy's, like, even the guy that's swinging at him is, like, 6'7".  And he took such a fucking fake bitch shot.  If you're going to try to knock out that fucking big maniac, you know, you're really going to cold clock him.  Yeah.  And this is such bullshit.  It's pissed me off so bad because they had me.  Those fuckers had me.  Where did, hold on, dude, when did you see the, um, when did you see the actual disclaimer?  Is it in every episode?  Is it buried at the end?  It has to be, sure.  Well, what happened was I think that people might have started implanting or something. 
[03:01:30]  And then it wasn't until, like, probably they had me for, like, six fucking episodes.  And then all of a sudden I'm, like, I started saying to my buddy, I'm, like, I don't know, bro.  That looks a little fucking fraudulent.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden I stopped peeking.  And in the beginning I'm, like, motherfucker.  They put a little disclaimer on now.  Ever since then I'm, like, fuck them.  They're done.  I'm done with that.  Yeah, reenactments and shit with stuff on the internet.  That's old school, man.  I don't need fucking reenactments.  This isn't Unsolved Mysteries.  Who the fuck wants that shit?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And by the way, little Jimmy Neutron, I love you, buddy. 
[03:02:00]  Thank you.  I'm going to go back to 50 Cent.  See you later.  All right, buddy.  I'm out, buddy.  Uh, oh, there was somewhere else I wanted to go.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it was worth it, too.  Fuck!  Fuck!  Oh, Parking Wars.  Oh, yeah.  I saw one of it.  But that wasn't what I was thinking of.  Uh, you ever see Cheaters?  What?  The Speeders show?  Was Cheaters real?  No.  I think so.  Parking Wars is pretty, oh. 
[03:02:30]  Kevin, go ahead.  I got to, I got to do some thinking.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Have you seen that one?  Yeah, I've seen Parking Wars.  Pretty good show.  Out of Philly.  Yeah, yeah.  Philly.  I mean, those, uh, just like you guys have described before, the meter maids are just  total bitches and cunts, you know?  Yeah, they go after them.  Uh, that's all I got.  Yeah, I know.  I've been sort of, that's all I got.  No, that's cool.  Oh, here it is.  Really fast.  Before I lose it again.  Russ asks from Jersey, you guys ever see Man vs. Food? 
[03:03:00]  I don't think so.  It's on the Travel Channel.  This guy goes around the country.  Travel Channel.  No way.  I've seen that.  It's a battle he loses frequently.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Uh, this guy goes around the country looking for local food eating challenges like the  20 pound pizza.  And then Russ writes, but he always has a beer though, because he's a real man.  Fucking A.  Fucking A.  It's just stupid, isn't it?  That's a dumb show.  Yes, it is.  You have so many channels that you got to fill them with something. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, they're running out of ideas.  Yeah.  Have you seen Locked Up Abroad?  What?  Oh, I saw an episode of that.  That's pretty good.  Wait, what is it called?  It's called Locked Up Abroad.  Not They Locked Up a Girl.  It's Locked Up Abroad, where they take a story of somebody that is in prison, has been  imprisoned overseas somewhere.  For like spitting on the sidewalk or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Something stupid.  Drugs.  Yeah, most of it's like people trying to smuggle drugs back into the streets.  Smuggle drugs.  And they're never guilty. 
[03:04:00]  It's always a misunderstanding.  And the government doesn't want to hear their misunderstanding story.  You sit in jail for five years.  Yep.  Right away.  Pretty good.  You got to take the big fat guy and put a big peg through the back of his head and  then run out of the prison before his fat little children find you.  Why would you try to smuggle drugs back into the states?  Holy shit.  A lot of money, I guess.  Yeah, but holy shit.  I want to smuggle one stupid Cuban cigar back into the states. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, I know.  Too much of a pussy to try that.  Yeah, I know.  Why is that?  I think about doing that every time we come back from Montreal.  And I'm like, no, that's going to be the time I get caught.  The Cubans.  Cubans.  Oh, just smell it to yourself, you dope.  They'll just take them.  You think they'll just take them?  They don't want to be bothered by a dumpster.  A couple of cigars.  Yeah, dude.  Are they just going to smoke them?  I'm going to try.  We're going to go on vacation soon.  I'm going to try that.  Why not?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you guys say it's okay.  They'll just take it.  I never said it was okay. 
[03:05:00]  I don't condone that.  I understand it.  Did you ever watch Degrassi, The Next Generation?  Oh, God.  What?  Degrassi, The Next Generation?  I've seen that.  Yeah?  No.  What is Degrassi, The Next Generation?  Well, the original was like Degrassi Junior High.  Right.  And they were kids.  It was a show about kids in junior high.  I don't remember this.  And it's made in Canada.  It's massive in Canada.  Yeah, it was in the 80s.  It's huge.  But now Degrassi is back.  It's a giant show in Canada.  It's big here, too.  It's on the N, which is Nick for teens. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, phew.  I thought you were talking about BET.  That's what I call it.  I get it all confused.  I'm going to run down some shows.  Survivor Man, Nip Talk, Monster Quest.  Anybody?  How about The Exterminators?  The Exterminators?  I don't think I've seen that show.  That sounds like a cool show.  Jeremy, what's up?  Hey, bu-bu-boys. 
[03:06:00]  Hi.  By the way, Dominic Nardella sends his regards here from K-Rock.  Who?  What?  Dominic Nardella, the PD here at K-Rock.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Oh, fucking Nardboy in Cleveland.  Yeah, he's...  Yeah, Nardboy.  Yeah, I like him, man.  He's a good dude.  He's always good to us.  What is he doing now?  Yeah, I'm a pretty good friend of this.  Still at the station.  He didn't get an accent, thank God.  Good, he shouldn't.  What's the rumor up there?  Are they going to flip that thing?  That's already been flipped.  Yeah, Cleveland's already been flipped, bro.  Yeah, but they're just doing what, rock or something?  Jockless.  Jockless?  Yeah, Jockless. 
[03:06:30]  It's just a computer in the middle of the old studio now.  That's going to be kind of cool, no?  No, it sucks, man.  Dude, I miss you guys on regular radio.  Don't be wrong.  I love the XM, but I miss you guys on regular radio, too.  Dude, fuck regular radio.  I know we were on it.  Honestly, it's not fun.  It was a fucking nightmare.  You guys alluded to Asians.  We had to dump it.  It wasn't even cursing.  It was just awful.  I fucking love doing this show on XM.  What's that?  Yeah, it's only me on the Asian humor thing.  It's a bit of a pain in the ass. 
[03:07:00]  I'm sorry, but I have Asian friends.  I make FOMO all the time, and they're not offended.  No.  It's not.  Anyways, I'll probably talk about the Exterminator show.  Now, how cool is that show?  I haven't seen it.  That's why we're taking your phone call.  What is it about?  Obviously, they're going after rats and shit.  It's based out of Louisiana.  They go after various things.  Alligators, roaches, fire ants, bats.  I would like that, because bugs people...  Chinch bugs.  Do they ever get bit?  No.  I want to see the cockroaches. 
[03:07:30]  I want to see a ridiculous amount of cockroaches.  No.  Watch last week's episode.  You'll get to see plenty.  This house has a 20-year infestation.  20 years of cockroaches?  Are they too busy to get it fixed?  That's got to be at least a couple dozen cockroaches after 20 years.  Nah, there's a lot more than that.  Perhaps more than that.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  I might have to take a look at that one.  Why not?  Is there any stuff on YouTube?  I would love to see a clip or something, if there's any.  Yeah, find me a good cockroach clip there. 
[03:08:00]  Danny's replacement.  Dude, I've looked up...  ...for one day.  Can't wait for him to come back.  Yeah, really?  We would have had some Degrassi the Next Generation clips.  Oh, man.  It would have been right there.  He's still showing me Tiger Woods.  What are you talking about?  We started talking about that an hour ago.  Whoa, whoa, Tiger Woods.  Whoa, whoa.  He's Tiger Woods.  Whoa.  You don't like David?  I love David.  I love David.  Who likes David?  I do very much.  In itself.  Um.  All right.  It's unanimous. 
[03:08:30]  It is unanimous.  We all love him.  Even Danny's replacement for the day likes David.  Little bird.  Danny doesn't like David.  I have a name.  Danny doesn't like David?  No, not even.  For real?  Oh, Danny hates David.  That's David.  Why?  Does he hate him on the air?  Yep.  Really?  Danny's very annoyed by David.  He's very frustrated.  He just doesn't have the patience for him.  Well, no one does.  Right.  That's the beauty of him.  Ow.  This is crazy.  I think I just lost my eyeball.  The internet sucks dick today, huh?  See?  It's not my fault.  It's very hard to, uh.  Danny would be here doing the same thing.  Get real-time quotes.  Danny would rewire the computer. 
[03:09:00]  Danny doesn't know how to do it.  We get our, uh.  Danny would have fixed it.  We wouldn't be looking at silly Tiger Woods while we're talking about television shows  if Danny was here.  Good point, Sam.  Oh, good.  Steve's the message.  Network is slow.  Yeah.  Thanks, Steve.  Yes.  Steve earned his paycheck today.  He just wanted to prove that he's finally listening to the show.  Yeah.  That's good, Steve.  Show us off.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  All right.  Should we take a break and get it to this?  We never did the Spike Lee thing for Jimmy. 
[03:09:30]  I want to hear that.  And some cursing on Jimmy Kimmel.  Some stripper stories.  Stories.  No more TV shows, Sam.  What's this Des Moines radio station getting into a fight?  Oh, yeah.  So, like, the, uh.  Is this good?  Yeah.  The commercials were playing.  But you can hear behind the commercials the DJs are just cursing a storm at each other.  What is it?  A radio station?  Yeah, in Des Moines, like a sports station.  This shit happens and they get fired.  The best part is at the end, because you can hear they come on the air.  Yeah.  As if nothing happened. 
[03:10:00]  Let's go.  Was it over grapes?  Or was it?  And you worked.  Your home for Royals baseball is Des Moines sports station for.  Oh, my God.  You can hear them start up.  You're, you're home for.  They get loud.  You're home for Royals baseball?  Royals baseball.  Kansas City Royals, yeah.  Big radio voice.  The guy, guy going there.  Okay.  Your home for Royals baseball is Des Moines sports station 1460 KXNO.  We can't control the temperature outside, but inside your home, we've got that taken care of.

Somebody must have had credentials, didn't use them properly to get the material he needed.  It sounded like the guy had two credentials, so maybe he could have shared one.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the beauty coming out.  It sounded like he was a fucking asshole.  Yeah.  The fight continues until they go in the air like nothing's wrong.

[03:12:30]  Good morning, Central Iowa.  Hope your brackets look a heck of a lot better than mine do.  Kenny Miller is in studio.  I am John Miller.  Marty Terrell will be in shortly in 10.  I went 11-5 yesterday.  I got walloped.  Yeah.  You were just calling me a fucking asshole.  If you recall.  Wow.  When did that happen?  It was just on the news today, so it's new.  He's so fired by the news. 
[03:13:00]  So fired.  Whose fault is that?  Like, the guy who pushed the, like.  Whoever's running the board, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  Unless he did it on purpose to, like, expose this dude.  But would the guy get in trouble?  I guess whoever's talking would get in trouble without the board guy.  It's your responsibility to see the light being on it.  Hey, we're back, fucking assholes.  Well, they let the music play a little bit because he wasn't ready.  He wasn't finished motherfucker enough.  You could hear him screaming throughout the whole music.  All right, we'll take a quick break and get into a few other things before we get out of here. 
[03:13:30]  Hey, yo, what's up?  Yo, it's the Kid 50 Cent.  You're now listening to my pal, Lil' Johnny Newton.  Neutron.  Norton?  Lil' Jimmy Neutron.  Norton.  Why do you keep Jimmy Neutron as the thing, right?  Norton.  What up?  It's the Kid 50 Cent.  You're now tuning into the sounds of me and my man, Jimmy Norton.  G-G-G-G-U-N-E.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:14:00]  Hey, what's up?  I want to, people have been getting on me for a long time about using America Online. 
[03:14:30]  I am now getting off AOL.  My God, what year is this?  I know.  I'm a slow boy.  My new email address for fans to interact with and you know I do.  CompuServe?  No.  See, that's a funny little joke about somebody that's been on the internet using a training  wheel system for a long time.  CompuServe.  I don't use AOL.  I just use the email address.  I go right to...  Oh!  It's amazing the names that are taken on Gmail.  It's fucking so annoying. 
[03:15:00]  Hmm.  I tried to get 40 X's, a P, and two Y's and it was taken by a guy with that name somewhere  in Bangladesh.  You know that's going to never be taken if they could figure that out.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  17, Frank!  Fuck.  One, two, three.  My new fan email address for any interactions you want would be therealjimnorton at gmail.com.  It's one word.  The real Jim Norton.  Yeah.  Jim Norton was taken, of course.  Monster Rain was taken, of course.  Tinkle Drinker was taken, of course. 
[03:15:30]  Yellow Treats was taken, of course.  So have one of those guys give them back.  Nah, Jim Norton could be anybody.  I want it to be Jim Norton.  I don't know who's...  Jim Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  How about Jim Norton?  Jimmy Norton was taken.  Jimmy Norton.  That's not his name.  Let's do the Spike Lee thing.  Yeah.  Where was he when he...  Why am I stuttering?  Where was he?  Spike doing now.  Spike Lee.  Scrolling some kind of TMZ reporter.  Well, why wouldn't he?  Come on.  You're a hack, man.  How is that? 
[03:16:00]  We work for T...  What's that?  TMZ.  Do we know the setup to this?  Two black guys.  Yeah, well...  One mad at the other.  He was getting off his plane.  I think he was either landing in New York or L.A.  Probably L.A.  Commercial flight?  Yeah.  And he was just getting off in the airport and leaving the airport.  And the TMZ video guy just started kind of following him and saying,  Hey, what's up, Spike?  How's it going?  Blah, blah, blah.  Are you doing a documentary about Kobe?  And he was trying to ignore him and trying to ignore him.  And then eventually he just turned around and started scolding him.  Right on. 
[03:16:30]  How can they not throw that guy out of the fucking airport?  It was right outside the airport.  So literally, the minute you walk...  There's, I guess, a public area.  The baggage claim area is where you can start filming, I guess.  They should just ban nuisance filming.  There's got to be a way to ban nuisance filming where you can...  There's a freedom we have to have to be able to film things.  If two guys are fighting or whatever...  But there's got to be a way to fucking ban nuisance filming.  When you're out in public, that's a tough one.  I know, I know.  But again, the technology is different than it used to be. 
[03:17:00]  I mean, again, laws have to kind of follow technology.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  All set, Jim.  By the way, we have a nice little audience out there.  I mean, a little one.  It's Monday.  Usually we get the big audience on a Friday.  Ooh.  Who's the Amish girl?  But we got two weeks left of this.  You know that, right?  We're down in the last two weeks of having a live audience until we figure it out at the  new joint.  So I just want to let people know that.  That's it?  I think so.  Take a picture.  We have two weeks left.  Right?  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Starting in April.  What is Jimmy doing for this picture?  Getting my fucking picture took.  Take a picture, bitch.  Let's just take your pics.  All right.  Who that bitch?  Who is that bitch?  Who is the bitch out there that has the long green...  Oh, you can't see her.  Who is that girl?  I see her now.  Hi.  Which one is your boyfriend?  She's all bundled up like...  What?  She needs a cup of tea.  He's not your boyfriend?  He's my Adam.  He's your Adam?  What does that mean?  What?  You're going to take his rib?  He's...  What does it mean? 
[03:18:00]  His name is Adam Yedman.  And he's going to San Diego on Friday.  Oh.  Hi.  Cool.  Hi, Adam.  Hey, Adam.  Hey, Jimmy.  What?  I made this for Opie.  Well, come in here and give it to him.  She's fucking cute.  Get in here.  Get in here, Amish outfit.  Get in here.  What is it?  I don't know.  It's probably an Afghan.  And it just means that when you have...  When you have really bad gas, it's called fire ass.  Oh, nice.  And I just wanted you to know.  And I figured if there was a visual, you would really remember.  Wow.  You know something, Opie?  A nice frame. 
[03:18:30]  Well...  And you put that up...  I just might have to tweet this.  You put that up on your wall at home.  Well, no.  In a nice frame.  I'll put it on my Twitter.  And you know when it's fire ass?  When it's just...  What?  Everyone wants to die.  Yeah.  I just had to make it for you.  All right.  Hold on.  What's your name, madam?  Liz.  Hi, Liz.  Where are you from?  Liz.  Can I tweet you?  No, this is my tweet.  No, not her.  We can't share tweets.  This is my tweet.  I'm from Rockland County.  Yeah?  Okay, cool.  I'll tweet you without your face.  Who, uh... 
[03:19:00]  Did your little sister make that?  No, I made it.  Oh, oh, awkward.  Oh, oh, awkward.  But my friend made the ass part because I don't have good handwriting.  Language.  Yeah, really.  But we're in XM.  Very nice.  I'm going to hang it up here.  Oh, that's what I want.  I'm going to hang it up near Ronnie's area.  Ronnie likes stuff like that.  He likes little artsy stuff.  You come off crazy as a shithouse rat.  I know.  She is a fucking nut.  That's why I wore this.  And this because I really wanted you guys to say, oh, fire ass, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:19:30]  No, that's cool.  Believe me, I got no problem with, like, crazy bitches.  Are you crazy?  What's your deal?  Yeah, I'm a little.  A little nutty?  Yeah, she's staring right through me.  Yeah, yeah.  She got, like, a little.  I dropped out of school because I went to Vegas.  To do what?  I'm crazy.  To go for hotel management, of course.  So that's normal.  That's not crazy stuff.  I know, but I feel like because I dropped out of school.  We should do some kind of a thing back and forth.  Let's say I'm the hotel manager.  Okay.  And you come to me with.  Kidding.  It's a little office joke that we do. 
[03:20:00]  Not an office joke, but an office joke.  Yeah, so what?  You dropped out of school.  You go to Vegas.  I went to Vegas.  And what happened?  Why aren't you still there as a hotel manager or something?  Because it sucks.  Vegas sucks?  Yeah.  For hotel management?  I was right off the strip.  It sucks.  Wait, hold on there.  No, I live in Rockland.  So she moved back to Rockland County because Vegas sucks.  Yeah, yeah.  Rockland.  What hotel sucked?  I mean, you said you were off the main.  Yeah, I was at UNLV.  It's like a mile. 
[03:20:30]  Not like a half a mile away from the strip.  And were you working at a hotel?  No, I was just going to school.  But I was going to work.  But then I dropped out.  So I didn't.  So you really can't finish anything.  Not even the sign.  Like you said, your friend had to do the ass part.  Good point, Anne.  I wasn't sure if there should be anything you've got.  What do you do?  Suck dick until he yells, I'm coming?  And then you go, all right, phone call.  I wasn't sure if I should do anything else in the back.  You guys can color it anymore if you want.  No, I want you to continue with that.  I think it's a work in progress.  Yeah, I think it's a work in progress.  I also hear you have a backpack full of clothes. 
[03:21:00]  I do.  What happened?  Oh, wait.  I have the best jumpsuit that my friend got for me the other day.  It looks like a big black woman outfit.  Yeah.  But I think they're actually parachute pants, but I wear it as a dress.  So you want to wear it?  Really?  Why don't you put that on?  Can I put it on a shirt?  That's interesting.  A fashion show is something we love.  Is there a bathroom here?  You're on the opening.  Well, no.  We just shit into our hats right over there.  The bathroom is right over there.  We shit into our hats.  Well, I have a question for you, too, because you're an odd girl, obviously.  You're wearing these really weird fucking Roberto Alomar's fucking shoes.  Wait, don't I look like a tourist from Europe, though? 
[03:21:30]  No, you're dressed like Kathy Bates in Misery.  But you're very sexy.  You have a shawl on.  Yeah.  And then a pink, what would that be called?  A little sweatshirt.  But it's weird.  It's sort of like a holly hobby thing.  And you can do...  What kind of underpants do you have on, please, I could ask you?  You're dressed like a Muslim.  They're from Victoria's Secret.  Come on, just your panting.  Are you like...  Does she go...  Oh, she's got a crazy girl laugh, though.  Are you conservative crazy, or are you like sexy crazy, where you'll kind of get a little funky? 
[03:22:00]  I'll say sexy crazy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'd like to not call myself a conservative.  I'm a libertarian.  Sorry about that.  Okay.  I'm not really a political affiliate.  We're talking like conservative and just your craziness.  No.  Are you like outwardly crazy?  Yeah.  Or crazy in the bedroom?  Are you crazy?  Well, I guess both.  Yeah?  That's cool.  But don't tell...  Sorry, Adam.  What do you like in the bedroom?  Adam, by the way...  Oh, I can't really talk about this, because my boyfriend's dad works at Sirius, and then 
[03:22:30]  he'll probably listen to his dad work here.  Your boyfriend...  What's your boyfriend's...  Let's make a decision here.  What's your boyfriend's last name?  Penny.  I never heard of him.  As long as it's not Carmisen, I'm fine.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  That is the only one.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  So how long are you with this guy?  Um, a year on last February...  This February.  A year this February?  His name's Skylar Penny, and pennies don't even like him.  Get it? 
[03:23:00]  No.  What do you mean?  How does a penny not like him?  Skylar Penny?  Yeah.  And pennies don't even like him?  Yeah.  Penny!  Penny!  I miss you, Penny!  Penny!  Lost.  I don't...  I don't understand that reference.  What does that mean?  But if you knew who the pennies, then you would.  Oh, oh, like...  Hi, Mr. Penny.  Wow, she's nuts.  We're not nailing it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  I don't know.  I'll tell you what.  She's hard to figure out.  Why is Adam freaking out?  I'm trying to...  Why is Adam freaking out?  What's the matter, Adam? 
[03:23:30]  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Adam.  Why would that work?  Wait, we can't hear you.  Go ahead, Adam.  Why would that work?  Hold on, Adam.  Please hold, Adam.  Please hold until...  Wireless mic.  Turn it on, please.  Why would it work?  No, it's not on.  No, it's not on.  Wait, Adam is so happy.  David, stop yelling it's on, you dumb motherfucker.  If it's on, we'd be hearing it.  That's right.  It's on.  It's on.  Do you remember Mr. Penny said don't say his name on the radio?  I didn't say his first name.  No.  You just said Mr. Penny. 
[03:24:00]  As opposed to all the pennies that are there.  Do you remember the Jim Jefferies show?  Did I do something?  No, I'm just remembering.  I really was hoping that I would somehow come on the air today, and I just wanted to tell  that guy who went to the 10 o'clock show, and he stood up and said, OB.  I just thought he was so dumb and funny, I just wanted to say hi.  She didn't say hi.  I saw it right when she walked in, dude.  I looked in her eyes and went, shithouse rat.  Wait, but did you see him? 
[03:24:30]  You were walking to the front, and you went, OB.  All right, he was just showing me a little love, I guess.  I don't know.  This is so funny.  With a name like Penny, is he in charge of the stocks?  Come on, it's funny.  Come on.  Even they got to laugh at that.  Must be the CFO.  Headquarters.  He's the CFO.  Wow.  So, yeah, we're not getting to the meat of this one yet.  No, no.  So she dropped out of school, went to Vegas, hotel management, failed miserably, came back 
[03:25:00]  to Rockland.  So now what are you doing?  Going to community college.  Community college.  College, what do you hope to do?  I'm going to go back to New Paltz.  Sooner New Paltz, best New York State University in the whole world.  But what are you going for there?  What's your goals?  Communications.  Communications.  Yeah, why not?  All right, so radio, something like that.  New Paltz rules, actually.  Yeah.  It's a cool area.  I'll tell you what's crazy about her.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  She has the demeanor of a woman who has just come back, who has just had to call the police  and say, yes, another one of my babies has died.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's four.  That's four.  That's four.  It's very bad luck.  I'm just going to start over.  And thanks for all your flowers and attention.  Yes.  Yes.  She is a kook.  No, but you know, when you feel like you're on too many drugs, I don't know why I feel like  that, though.  What do you take?  Are you on drugs?  I'm on, well, I'm on antidepressants, but.  Let's guess which one. 
[03:26:00]  But I stopped taking them a few days ago.  Oh, see?  That's what it is.  You know, I feel like I.  What were you taking?  Let me look at you.  Let me tell you.  Don't say.  You probably took Effexor?  No, I don't know what that is.  Paxil.  Lexapro.  Lexapro.  Wow.  What is Lexapro all about?  That's heavy duty.  Did you get the zaps in your brain?  There's a weird side effect, though, where some people who take it feel like they get these  little shocks in the head.  That's what I've been getting for the past two days, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's Lexapro side effect.  What, did you just get it? 
[03:26:30]  She's looking at me now.  Yeah, she just looked at Sam.  She just looked at Sam and made like a wheeze.  Why are you looking at Sam?  Wait, do you guys watch SNL?  No.  No, what's that?  You know Kristen Wiig?  Well, she's my favorite person on there now.  Hi, Kristen.  All right, how old are you?  20.  20?  Okay.  So you went to school and you dropped out because you didn't like the Vegas thing,  and now you're going to come back.  Okay, when are you leaving for New Paltz?  I'm going back next semester. 
[03:27:00]  I was there for two years when I transferred.  What's up with the drugs?  Why did you need to go on that?  Right.  Because Vegas depressed me.  Oh, Vegas did it?  It does me, too.  Believe me.  I've left that town very depressed at the amount of money I left at the table.  What's depressing about Vegas?  It's just a shitty place to live.  It's like fun to go to, but it's a shitty place to live.  Yeah, because it's all like fake stuff.  Well, not even that, but no one stays.  Okay, so fuck me.  No, no, no, yeah.  Well, that's true, but have you ever lived there? 
[03:27:30]  You've just visited, right?  I just visited.  I feel like when you lived there, and I was only there for two months, but when you live  there, no one stays there.  They always move, and you can't make friends.  And even at a university, I just think that's dumb.  You just can't meet people.  Was it really university, or was it just like fucking hotel management school?  It was, like, people went there for other things, which I don't understand why you would  ever go to Vegas for not hotels or gambling or strippers.  UNLV is where Roland went.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  He's the guy who's always hot.  Why would you pick fucking the desert? 
[03:28:00]  Should have taken the University of Alaska.  In his T-shirt.  He's from Milwaukee or something.  Wow, you are, uh, you're something.  Am I sitting too close to this thing?  No.  So you were a little bit nutty?  Do you have a bad temper?  Yeah.  Really?  What do you do that's nutty, though?  Yeah, what do you do?  She just bees nutty.  Single white female stuff?  Just kind of...  Yeah.  I'm not single.  Oh, single lady.  Oh, single lady. 
[03:28:30]  Holy shit.  Wait, do you guys ever have dance parties in here?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Can you dance?  We can never find people that dance.  No, give us a song.  Oh, wow.  Give us a song.  Put on that weird black thing you were talking about.  Oh, single ladies.  You want to dance to some?  No.  What do you want to dance to?  Wait, it's headphones.  All right, we'll dance to this.  Wait, you don't like the headphones?  Wait, put on...  She's doing like the...  What dance is that called?  The single lady.  I said beyond the single lady.  I think it's like almost a salt and pepper shake. 
[03:29:00]  It's the natterpuss.  That's the fun.  It's the natterpuss.  Oh, we should get her to do a little natterpuss dance.  Wow.  That's the fucking De Niro dance in Awakenings.  Wow.  Yeah, she's dancing.  Yeah, can you do the natterpuss dance?  I don't know what that is.  Oh, it's really good.  It's like this.  You want E-Rock to show you?  E-Rock, show her the natterpuss dance, please.  Oh, God.  She has a nice hiney.  You do have a nice hiney, I noticed.  I didn't really look at it.  I just left this dress yesterday.  Can I see the key?  Turn around.  Yeah, turn around and show her your hiney. 
[03:29:30]  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Well, she's 20.  It's pretty hard to have a shitty shitter at 20.  That's not true.  That's a good point.  Well, no, unless you're...  I mean, if you're fat, you got a bad one.  Yeah, yeah, very flat.  Yeah.  Just tell Skylar Penny that.  Oh, shit.  Because he's half Asian.  Oh, really?  But his sister's hot and so does his mom.  His sister's hot and so does his mom?  I can't tell.  That's not a best-un insult.  I mean, a hot sister's fine.  So, E-Rock, do you want to...  Show her the natterpuss dance?  Yeah, show her the natterpuss dance.  Okay.  Do we have to play the natterpuss dance?  Yes, we do. 
[03:30:00]  We could just sing it.  All right.  Sam has a great suggestion.  Sing the natterpuss song.  You can call me the natterpuss, natterpuss.  Guess what?  I like pancakes.  That's how it ends.  She thinks you're crazy, which is really fucked up.  What's up, Liz?  Jesus.  Show her the natterpuss dance on the screen so she can do it.  No, E-Rock just did it. 
[03:30:30]  Wait, do you guys know my name?  Liz.  Liz.  I don't remember.  But you just came in.  A mere...  You know.  But I wouldn't remember my name if I talked to you.  You're like a pet.  You have no concept of time.  Yeah.  Like you come home and your pet thinks you've been gone for a year.  She's been a year or a minute.  I'm not sure.  Are you on drugs right now?  No.  I know you're not off the main drug, but maybe some...  I know.  I think there is some kind of drugs in me.  A little recreational... 
[03:31:00]  A little...  You look like Meryl Streep if she was nuts.  The way you dress and stuff.  That's the way Meryl Streep would dress.  You want her to take the pink top off you were saying, Jimmy?  I do, but she don't...  It's...  Yeah, I want to see her.  It's just a...  She's all bundled up.  Yeah, because it's a weird jacket.  She's very sexy.  We just want to...  Oh, it's a whole dress.  You see it?  Oh.  Let's see the dress.  Isn't it pretty?  Wait, show Jimmy.  I can't see.  No, that's such a...  The shawl, yeah.  Yeah, the shawl.  Let's just see the nice pretty dress.  Oh, my backpack is in here.  No, no, the other places. 
[03:31:30]  The other one's in there.  There you go.  Now, Jimmy, what do you think of...  I'm a fan of the dress.  Yeah.  Nipping in the dress is nice.  I stopped wearing bras.  You should have.  Yeah.  You shave under your arms or no?  What?  Do you shave under your arms?  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe you were really fucking hippie.  I just shaved my arms.  It looks like...  Why are you covering your thing with the shawl?  Why are you covering your nips?  Because my belly looks big.  No, it doesn't.  What?  No.  It's fantastic.  It's just a little...  It's a little gas.  It's fine.  Yeah.  It's fire ass.  Fire ass, eh?  Going back to the fire ass poster she made for us. 
[03:32:00]  I got fire ass on the train this morning as soon as I walked on the subway.  Do you fire it?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  That's what fire ass is.  And then what, uh...  And then this girl just gave me the worst look in the whole world.  She knows it was you?  Yeah, I don't know how.  I guess because I got on the train.  I would pick, like...  I would just look at any guy in there and think it's them first.  Well, that's what I would think.  Why do you, uh...  She probably had her feet up on the...  Those are napkins.  No, I wasn't sure if they were Jamba Juice.  No one's complaining, but why do you decide not to wear a bra anymore?  Because it's not comfortable.  It should be said, by the way, this girl has a very nice vibe. 
[03:32:30]  I'll say, she's very sexy.  Yeah.  I started nude modeling two weeks ago.  Did you really?  Really?  And my first real time, I passed out and hit my head and had to go to the emergency room.  What are you, nude modeling for classes?  For classes.  Isn't that the worst thing in the world?  What, you're saying that are people that are drawing you or something?  Yeah, they draw them.  You know what's weird?  Jimmy is a sketch artist.  I'm an artist and I never went to, uh...  Could you give Jimmy like five minutes to sketch you?  How much do you charge for an hour to sketch?  It's $18 an hour where I work. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, that's how much you get?  Yeah.  Okay.  $18 an hour?  Isn't that good?  I will try to...  Righteous bucks?  I'll try to...  How do you normally stand or pose when you do it?  I don't know.  I've only done it once and then I passed out.  I will give you, uh...  I can sketch you in five minutes, but I'm guaranteeing you that I'll have problems with your hands.  I'm a good artist.  I'm good with faces.  I need a pencil, though, if you have a pencil.  Sharpie.  Yeah.  You don't sketch with a Sharpie or a pen?  Steve.  Yeah.  The guy's, uh...  Sorry, Adam.  This must be so weird for you. 
[03:33:30]  Ah, Adam.  Oh, Adam.  Don't worry about it, Adam.  Can we sit over there, though?  No, no.  Adam can stay where he is.  Adam, I tried.  As a matter of fact, if Adam even chirps up, the security's gonna throw him out, so he knows to shut the fuck up.  You have to be nude for this for me to sketch you.  That's fine.  You're not gonna get no one's gonna bother you.  That's for real, man.  How are you not finding a pencil in this?  I'll start it with...  Like the scene on the Titanic?  Like the Titanic thing?  I'm not...  But I...  How do you want her to pose?  I mean, it's gotta be...  It doesn't have to be one that I was...  It's gotta be classy. 
[03:34:00]  Do you guys know art at all?  Yeah, of course we do.  Do you know Marlene Dumas?  Yes.  You like?  Really?  How about this?  Sit in that chair.  It doesn't have to be...  How would you normally pose?  Show me how you would normally pose.  Well, it depends what kind of art you wanted to do.  The one that I was doing where I...  Well, the first pose I did, I was laying on a bench.  And my arms were all right.  Oh, that's a good one.  Arching in the back, you know.  Well, yeah, that's what it was.  And I guess when your head is below your heart, it makes your blood pressure drop.  Yes. 
[03:34:30]  And then, like...  Drop!  And then, like, an hour later, I passed out.  Can we see?  If you get...  I will pay you for an hour, although I'm only going to sketch you for five minutes.  Because it's getting late in the show.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, so don't shit on it if it's not perfect.  Yeah.  Okay?  You have to be nude like you would be in a class.  Really?  Why not?  Yeah.  No one's there.  We're not going to film you.  You're not going to be filming.  Are you sure?  100%.  We're not going to film you.  I promise you.  We're not allowed to film if you don't want to.  No cameras.  Yeah, don't even...  Yeah.  Don't even put the... 
[03:35:00]  No, no, everything's off.  She cannot be seen on Pal Talk.  Seriously.  I got people yelling at me because I haven't put the camera on her, so...  No cameras.  ...for one hour, and I'm only going to require a few minutes, and there are no...  We can't film you without telling you.  We're not going to do that.  I promise you.  We're not going to fucking do that.  I promise you.  Should I take my shoes off?  Shoes, you can leave if you're worried about hygiene, but if you want to take them off,  feel free.  Don't give socks on so you feel more hygienic.  I just want to be comfortable.  Okay.  Be comfortable.  Remember that girl on your show who was from Plague Girl? 
[03:35:30]  What?  And she started crying?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's in the house.  She's sitting right where you're sitting.  She's sitting where you are.  Matter of fact.  But we were filming her.  Yeah.  And she was just, you know...  We were just finger-popping her.  No.  Yeah, she was fine with us.  Yeah, she was fine.  She didn't like the discussion that was going on.  I liked the other girl because she was funny.  No cameras.  Yeah.  Oh, Taya?  Yeah, no cameras.  Yeah, no cameras.  No one has them.  I'm just letting them know.  No cameras.  Make sure Adam...  Don't peek.  Master Joe, anyone pop a camera out of their pocket, you put them in a sleeper hole. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, you smash them.  Yeah, they're fine.  No one's in a coma.  Yeah.  Nice dress.  Can you get my underwear on?  No, it's nude modeling.  Okay, you're fine.  And don't shit all over my photo either.  My drawing.  I haven't shaved my vaginal while.  It's fine.  It doesn't matter.  Let's see.  It's actually easier to do.  Finally.  You don't think this is weird?  No.  We've had girls do bizarre stuff.  Someone's actually just sitting nude for a...  Yeah.  Wait, that's not the pose though.  What are you doing?  Face me. 
[03:36:30]  That's pretty nice.  Face me.  Pose though.  Yeah, she looks good.  What's wrong with the pose, Jimmy?  I can't see where she didn't shave.  Sorry, Adam.  Turn this way.  Is Adam pissed off?  Where's Adam?  No, turn this way.  No, no, towards me.  A little bit.  Adam's depressed.  She looks right.  Why?  She's just got a little bit depressed.  How long has it been since you shaved?  Like two weeks.  Let me see.  I'm going to sketch you.  You're a woman.  I'm going to sketch you as a woman.  It's not going to be vulgar.  I promise.  I think it's better this way.  I know that, but I'm the artist.  No.  Turn your head so I don't like...  I'm tweeting you from the behind to really piss off everybody. 
[03:37:00]  You just get her feet in the back of her head.  Yeah.  Jimmy, give me a look for this picture.  Why hasn't anybody said, oh my God, what amazing tits you have?  She's fantastic.  Because it's not about...  You're very sexy.  We're trying to be classy.  I think you're blocking out right now.  You are?  I'm not going to remember.  You're fine.  Are you fainting?  No, because I'm sitting.  Yeah.  See?  I don't like the pose, though.  I'm still on the face. 
[03:37:30]  Are you comfortable?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy's really rocking the picture.  Wow, Jimmy's fucking good.  That's amazing, Jimmy.  He's fast, though, which is...  You should be working on the streets in New York.  Very interesting.  Mm-hmm.  It's hard with lined paper, Jimmy, or...  No, no, no.  I mean, it's harder with...  It's easy because I got a pencil.  Yeah.  But you'd rather probably have a clear palette.  I want to see...  I want to see something a little sexier.  But that's not art.  That's vulgar.  No, no, no.  It's not at all.  It all depends on...  No, no.  It's only vulgar if there's something sexual being done. 
[03:38:00]  If it's a woman actually just showing her mons, that's not vulgar at all.  That is art.  Are you kidding me?  That's absolutely not vulgar.  That's absolutely not vulgar.  Because what you're saying is that it's okay to...  He's whispering over there.  Yeah, who's whispering?  We'll get him yanked right out of this fucking studio.  Sam was whispering.  Travis was, actually.  That's the job.  We got a whisperer.  Could you come in here and get rid of Travis?  What?  Who's Sam?  No, somebody's got to work the internet.  Travis, you got to go.  Yeah, all right.  What? 
[03:38:30]  How's it coming over there, Jimmy?  It's good, but now, I'm like, right now, I'm down by the, uh, by the, uh, I'm just getting  past the breast.  This is a rough outline.  I'll go back up.  Post that.  I want to see, uh, I want to see a bit of a sexier pose, but not pornographic.  Don't be, no, just turn.  Be naked.  It's okay.  Turn towards me.  I'm not going to...  Why?  Are you on your thing?  What's wrong, Liz?  Oh, yeah, I am.  So don't worry about it.  Who cares?  I'm not going to look...  Oh, my God.  I didn't even realize. 
[03:39:00]  What?  You're on your, what?  Thing?  Yeah.  It's your time?  It's your honor, period.  You have to, how about this?  Can you just put your, like, you don't have to be forward, just open, part the legs slightly.  It doesn't have to be completely...  Liz, you all right?  Yeah, she's fine.  What's wrong?  I don't have to hurt my legs.  Why?  Huh?  I don't have to hurt my legs.  I don't have to hurt my legs.  No.  Okay, I'm down.  My friend Jan has those shoes.  Crazy chick. 
[03:39:30]  Jan.  Oh, nice.  Is your hair kind of reddish?  No.  Well, no.  No?  I just thought it was.  Because it is on your head.  No, it's not.  Really?  There's a, like, a reddish highlight to it.  Yeah, a little reddish highlights in there.  Sure.  Yeah.  I'm brown with some highlights.  Do you think you have nice boobs?  They're really nice.  Only the other day I said that.  Why the other day?  Because my friend said, oh, Liz.  Jan.  Jan said that.  He said, oh, Liz.  With the shoes. 
[03:40:00]  Really?  Jan.  Jan?  Jan, uh, Jan had a point.  Jan's a homosexual, though.  So I just figured.  He's homosexual?  She won't show us.  Well, to me.  Jim.  Is depressed.  No, it's not.  I'm depressed.  We're 99% there.  But I want to sketch you accurately.  And it's like your legs are.  I just want to see you sitting, you know.  What if she keeps her knees together, yet puts her feet on the ground, like, so there's 
[03:40:30]  no graphic display of anything, but you can see a little more of that area.  Yeah.  What you got to see?  Why don't you put your...  I think you want to see, like, the hairiness or something.  Yeah.  You want...  Can we pin your legs up, you know, behind your head, kind of?  See that, I don't think...  Do somersaults around the room.  I don't think anyone's ever going to go for that, to be God's honest with you.  Very nice.  Can I get a sticker?  Yeah.  Opening Anthony.  Open and Anthony.  Opening Anthony.  Open and Anthony.  You can.  He doesn't say your name in the show, because you started later, right? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they were already an established show, and I came on board.  He missed the sticker deadline.  Yeah, you don't change the name of the show.  By one day, his name would have been on there.  You don't have a show, right?  No, just this.  Yeah.  I'm kind of stuck now, because I got...  The position I'm putting her in is just with her legs parted slightly, and I can't get  any...  Why would you start the sketch that I'm not in, though?  Because I didn't want to get in that position, and I know what I want to sketch.  Thank you.  There you go.  Just a quick one. 
[03:41:30]  Just a quick.  Oh, quick, quick, quick.  What's...  There you go.  Only Jimmy can see.  Only the artist can see, so.  The artist.  The sketch.  She has great legs, too.  Yeah.  But they're purple.  What?  Do you have purple legs?  No.  What?  You know when you're so white that you turn purple?  Yeah.  How come you haven't shaved in a while?  Yeah.  It's usually dead girls.  Because I haven't seen my boyfriend.  Where is he?  He's in New York.  Okay.  Oh.  All right.  We got a look.  You only shave for your boyfriend?  Hmm?  You only shave for your boyfriend, huh? 
[03:42:00]  I don't bother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me...  Oh, she's...  I'm going to put my jumpsuit on now.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, I got it.  I mean, whatever.  Why do you got all these clothes with you, by the way?  That was in Queens.  That was a paid gig, by the way.  There you go.  That was for your chocolate.  You were in Queens?  It makes $18 an hour.  That was $20.  It was a paid gig.  Yeah.  It's...  It's a mark.  Let me see, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  It's really good.  That is really good.  I don't believe you.  For that quick.  I mean, if you took some more time...  You got the shawl.  I put a stamp on in there.  You ought to put that up, just the drawing.  No, I know how.  I'll let people see it. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah?  You're going to tweet?  I'm going to tweet my photo.  My drawing.  Yeah, Jimmy...  Oh, look at that.  And it gives you a nice little camel toe when you pull it out.  Yeah, I see that.  I like camel toes.  Most bizarre dress ever.  What do you call that?  It was $7.  It was $7?  My friend, who I was at at our house this weekend.  That's like two modeling things, or like one modeling thing gets you two dresses and like  some change.  Oh, and the shawl goes with it.  Yeah, it's...  Why do you like the shawl so much? 
[03:43:00]  I don't know.  It's comfortable.  It's a little old school for you.  Last week...  I mean, last year.  Oh, but last week was St. Patrick's Day.  Last week, I mean last year.  Last year when I went to St. Patrick's Day, I wrote this.  Yeah?  So I have to...  It's so comfortable.  It's like a blanket.  It's so big.  You're very kooky.  She's a nutty girl.  Yeah.  I just want to be a crazy old grandma.  Yeah?  Really short.  You got a while ago.  Show Liz the sketch, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Who's your influence, by the way, Jimmy?  I've seen some influences in your sketching. 
[03:43:30]  I like Roman Rockwell because I'm realistic.  I didn't like as much Van Gogh or the impressions or any of that stuff.  I prefer the realism of Roman Rockwell.  Classic, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, show her the sketch.  There you go, Liz.  Oh, that's good.  Why are you laughing?  This should be framed.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  You like it?  Yeah.  It's a beautiful sketch of you, nude.  When I was looking at the sketches of the people who are sketching me, not here, they 
[03:44:00]  gave me such big boobs.  Really?  Isn't that so happy?  Well, you got...  It's a happy thing.  I think it's a perspective thing that they are missing.  But you got big boobs.  Yeah.  You got like 34, leaning toward a D, probably a full C.  I see.  Full C?  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  I've been a 34B.  Nah.  B?  That's why I don't wear bras, because they just don't feel comfortable.  Yeah, no shit, because you're squeezing out of the sides.  Yeah, you need to... 
[03:44:30]  You're a C.  That's what you're supposed to do, so you get big cleaves.  Yeah, but you're a C. With the right C, you'd have cleaves.  What are you watching?  Um, you.  If you look around the room, there are various programs on.  Maury turned into Jerry Springer.  Wow, very good observation.  Yes, he did.  No, but I just watched it for the first time last week in like a few years.  It's all about paternity tests and things like that.  That's what I liked, but I like that he, like, you know, took like the whole episode to tell you. 
[03:45:00]  How old were you when you became sexually active?  16.  That's average.  Yeah.  That's good.  Same guy?  You with an L?  No.  Different guy?  Yeah.  High school sweetheart kind of a thing?  Yeah.  Or dropout sweetheart, whatever you want to call it.  Because she dropped out.  Oh, was it Adam?  No, it was Adam's friend.  It was Adam's friend?  Yeah.  Adam is just getting shit on constantly. 
[03:45:30]  Why do you think Adam would be uncomfortable?  Does he have a crush?  He's just a guy.  No.  So what's the problem?  He's just a friend?  I can explain the problem.  That's weird.  Um, actually, the friend was my best, is my, one of my best friends.  Adam is a homosexual.  No, I am not.  I'm teasing Adam.  Wait, but.  But my, dare to dream.  Oh, you're friends with her boyfriend.  What?  You're friends with her boyfriend.  Yeah, I met her through him, which is why it's a little weird.  But it wouldn't be like, if it was like, um, if it was one of my friends, like, you guys  are just friends too. 
[03:46:00]  If it was one of my friends, I wouldn't care if one of my friends.  Oh, believe me, I was all for her getting naked.  I would be mad if she didn't.  Oh, right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, you're a trooper then.  Good.  I didn't want you to cock block the room here.  Oh, no, I would never.  But it's weird because I'm better friends with her now than I am with the person that  I met her through.  Yeah, because she's a jerk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I wouldn't go that far, but.  You know, you are smart enough to know, Adam does want to have sex with you.  I don't think that, though.  No?  No, I, I mean, no.  Adam, I think this is a good time to talk about Jenny. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, no, not Jenny.  Oh, no, did you run cross country for three years because she fucking went out and caught  AIDS and then fucked you?  You're just fucking a retarded birder in the yard like a German shepherd.  Yes, you can.  Yeah, you can have gum.  And milk Jimmy's pretty.  Oh, my God, man.  You can have a piece of gum.  Who's Jenny?  Is that your girl?  No, no, that's my best friend.  You have a female friend named Jenny. 
[03:47:00]  She's a good friend.  Yes.  What does Jenny look like?  Is she as pretty as this girl?  No, she's prettier and she has much better boobs.  Okay, so he's a smart dude.  He's a good looking dude.  He has hot chick friends.  Yeah.  And he's waiting for the time when you and your boyfriend fight.  Right.  And you have a few belts of booze.  And you're finally like, ah, what the heck.  Jam it in there, Adam.  You need a penis to cry on.  Yeah.  And you'll say, no, not there.  Put it where the duty comes out.  And Adam will go, all right, if you're sure about this, as he's pushing the helmet in. 
[03:47:30]  He'll say, I'll give you the real definition of fire ass.  That's true.  As he's caping in your ass hair with his penis helmet.  Like, well, if you're sure about this.  When he comes, he's going to yell, fire.  Where is the fire?  Where is the fire?  Hey, Liz, you know Ruthie?  Ruthie.  Hold on.  I just wanted to jump out of that.  Go through that again, because no last names.  I didn't say the last name.  She did.  Don't say the last name.  I'm not allowed to?  Well, it's one of those things where we don't like last names here on the show. 
[03:48:00]  Ruthie Moore Lotto.  Deal with it at control.  I tried.  How did you say Ruth again?  I liked what you said her first name.  Ruthie.  No, you said it like, the first name.  You went, Ruth.  Ruth.  You like Ruth?  Yeah.  She says hi.  Hey.  Hey.  Where do you know Ruth from?  From high school.  Cool.  Young.  You liked her? 
[03:48:30]  Young.  You were friends?  We were lovers.  For real?  No.  What nationality are you?  White.  I didn't know that.  Nice.  I didn't say, why do I like you?  English, Irish, Austrian, and Polish, and Scottish.  The conqueror and the conquered.  I like that.  Bunch of it.  I wish I was German, though.  Does anyone take languages in high school?  Yeah, he does.  What about German?  I mean, what about high school?  I mean, what about college?  Good. 
[03:49:00]  Dave, we met your wife.  I actually do speak German.  This is Hans.  Hans is on yoga.  Nein.  See?  That was good.  Where did you learn it?  I went to Germany for three years.  I studied...  Is that where you studied art?  No, I didn't really take art, but I actually was in Germany.  I was making...  I made sauerkraut sculptures.  Should have taken improv in Germany.  Certainly, I'm displaying none here. 
[03:49:30]  Steven S. wants to know how many psychiatrists you've had sex with.  Oh, none.  None?  Do you do the psycho thing?  I only have one now.  One psychologist or...  It's funny.  Kenny put my wallet over there like she was going to steal it.  Yeah.  Got to find out.  Such a cop mentality.  All right.  This Liz girl is quite special.  I'll sign it, too.  Anything else, Liz?  No.  That's it.  Thanks for having me, guys.  Well, thanks for, like...  Getting naked for you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Liz, will you come back and chat with us again? 
[03:50:00]  You were fun to chat with.  You can keep your clothes on.  Can I be an intern for you guys?  But you don't have an internship.  You know what?  Kick David out.  She's doing...  She's going to New Paul's for...  Broadcasting.  How long are internships?  Oh, actually, she is going to New Paul's.  Five years.  David.  She just made a crazy look at you, but I'm not sure if it's just her look.  You know what, Liz?  If you want an internship...  No, I'm just saying.  Well, we've got an intern behind you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  David, are you willing to give up your spot so we can look at Liz naked every day? 
[03:50:30]  It means taking one for the team.  It means a lot to us.  By the way, if you like Germany, you hate David.  Why?  He's Jewish.  Look at him.  I like Jewish people.  You do?  I think I might be Jewish because my grandpa's...  He, my great-grandpa...  No, it's got to be...  Sorry!  He was adopted when he was in Poland, so it might be Jewish.  But it's got to be on the mother's side.  Or else you're not a real Jew.  Really? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  It's all maternal.  You've got to fall out of the vag, huh?  Yep.  You've got to fall out of a Jewish vagina.  If you don't tumble out of the vag, they fucking give you a whole bunch of malarkey?  Yes, they do.  As a matter of fact, right, David?  That's true, yes.  It's all on the mom's side.  That's right.  What do you think, David?  I don't know.  That's...  What?  That's tough.  What do you mean it's tough?  She wants to be an intern.  Look at the boobs on her.  Yeah, she's sexy.  She's a beautiful girl.  I have to admit that.  She is.  Oh, you're definitely a liking her, huh?  I do like...  Yes, thank you very much.  Do you have a Facebook or anything like that? 
[03:51:30]  No, of course I do.  Well, you might want to get in touch with David because, oh, does he love talking to the gals?  Oh, yeah, he does.  She's got very juicy bosoms.  Yeah, why is she putting her thing on like that?  Like you're like an old...  She's dressed like a gangbanger now.  She bundles...  An old Romanian woman.  Yeah, I know.  That's exactly what she says.  Wow, that is so long.  An old Romanian woman.  What the fuck, you're a young, nice-looking girl with nice, heavy breasts, and now you  look like an old Romanian woman.  Yes, you're Liz the Gypsy Lady.  You should be putting a curse on someone. 
[03:52:00]  Sinner.  Sinner.  Why did you do that?  David, she's going to be an intern.  I'm sorry.  You got to go.  So that means I'm gone?  You're out.  Today's my last day?  You're out.  All right.  You're out, Tom.  You're out, Dave.  It was a good internship.  You should have left an hour ago.  It was good.  Oh, well.  Wow.  Great acting, David.  Jesus.  Way to play along.  Way to go with it.  Way to take a bit that was dying and kill it with...  Force.  Stones.  Do you...  Because you got clothes with you. 
[03:52:30]  That's an odd...  Why?  I was in Queens for the weekend.  Oh.  Who are you staying with in Queens?  Sarah.  Sarah?  Who's Sarah?  I call her Farb.  Sarah Connor.  She's like...  She's one of my besties.  One of your besties.  You know, my besties.  Do you and her fool around?  No.  We show each other our boobs, though.  But that's standard.  You show each other your boobs?  She is biggest.  Yeah.  But is she fat and they're big, or... 
[03:53:00]  All right.  That's a shush sign.  That means Sarah's a big, fat, big...  Doesn't matter.  No, she's not big.  When boobs are big, and they're not a big girl.  She's a big, sexual woman.  She's a great big, fat person.  Yeah.  About a size 14.  When you guys are hanging out, and she shows you her boobs, do you jump on her bareback  and yell, Ride Piggy?  I don't know.  I'm asking.  Do you need a place to stay today?  That's what they answer.  No.  You all right?  I'm going back to school today.  New Paltz?  No, I'm just going home today.  Oh, the community school thing.  Oh, you have a home.  I looked like a homeless person this morning. 
[03:53:30]  I just think it's fine to sit wherever you want to sit.  And I sat on this poster on the street, and a policeman was like, Are you okay?  Because they look homeless.  Oh, yeah.  The cops are all like that.  Believe me.  If you were an old black gentleman, he'd just walk past and maybe hit you with a billy club.  He's like, Are you okay?  He'd be like, Are you KO'd?  If you weren't, he'd do it for you.  Well, that's something.  What do you do?  And you've got your sticker, see?  Holla.  You take the subway and stuff? 
[03:54:00]  Things like that?  Mass transit?  I took the train in, and Adam's going to drive me home, right?  Adam's a good guy.  He must love driving you home.  There's nothing more you love than driving a girl home where you can't fuck.  That's fun.  He's loving that.  You want to dance us out of here, or what?  Yeah, you are kind of crazy.  What song do you want to dance?  And you've got to sing it, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, please sing it, too.  Right?  What song could you sing and dance at the same time?  Wait.  Please.  Um, oh, it's... 
[03:54:30]  Mm-hmm.  The...  Boom, boom, boom.  The...  Mm-mm.  I'm too 3008.  You're so 2000 and late.  The...  Um, Travis?  Do you have a Black Eyed Peas song?  I am.  Does this ring your bell?  Yeah, yeah, that's Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas.  All righty.  Mm-mm.  Boom Boom Pow.  Mm-mm.  All right, get up.  Okay.  Put your headphones on.  Headphones are going on.  Can we call you Crazy Liz?  Okay.  Well, what do you want to be called?  Yeah, Crazy Liz.  All right, Crazy Liz.  First good, uh... 
[03:55:00]  Good first appearance, I should say.  Mm-mm.  She's going to dance us out of here.  Dance and sing us out of here.  That's nice.  Hit it.  She's, uh, got her arms up, like, in Baby.  Yeah, there she goes.  Over her head.  You are doing the very, very white girl dance.  With MC Hammer pants.  Yeah.  You gotta sing a little, though.  Yeah, this is...  I don't know any of the worst...  It's the worst dance ever.  This is almost as bad as Elaine Bennis' dance from Seinfeld. 
[03:55:30]  I call her Julia.  Oh, right.  Because you know her.  I don't know her dance, actually.  You go to the clubs and dance like this?  You throw 2,000 in late.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.  Come on, you can sing this part, please.  Boom, boom, boom.  Yeah.  She's good.  Crazy.  She's good. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, my God.  Wait, why can't you dance with me?  Liz, I wouldn't be...  No, no, no, no.  Liz, I wouldn't be doing my job for the fine folks out there.  Do you have a Facebook page?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She said, yeah.  I've never...  I know, but I mean, what I mean by that, are you willing to give it out because they are  dying?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Wow.  What's your Facebook page?  What's your Facebook page?  Liz.  Craig. 
[03:56:30]  Adam's in my picture!  Oh.  Graham Wiggs.  How do you spell it?  L-I-Z.  Oh, my God.  She's shaking her hands to Jesus right now.  L-I-Z what?  Craig.  C-R-A-I-G?  Yum!  Yum!  Ready?  Ready?  Hit it.  She's a fucking terrible dancer.  She's doing like this.  I don't know what you would call that.  It's awful.  It's the best dance.  It's like the 50s doll. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  It's like she's scooping big buckets of ice up.  Liz, can we put any single song on?  And beer pitchers.  That works?  Shake by Ying Yang Twins.  Can we film you dancing?  You're dancing.  All right, get the camera.  We'll film her dancing.  This, every single, you can put on any single song and it will work.  This?  I guarantee, put on a song.  This?  Yeah.  You have to.  Well, yeah.  I was putting no gusto into it at all.  I don't even know how to describe that for the radio audience.  I just picture how you have two big beer mugs in your hand and you're scooping ice real 
[03:57:30]  quickly out of an ice maker.  Kind of an uppercut.  Yeah.  Uppercut sideways.  And then a yes, like, yes.  She dances like Rod from What's Happening.  All right.  We're making a biz.  We're going to make a video.  Is that all right there, Crazy Liz?  Yeah.  Okay.  What song you need?  Oh, no.  I was in the lake.  She likes that bar.  She's good.  You want the other song?  Um, Shake?  Yeah, Shake. 
[03:58:00]  That?  Oh, yeah.  Shake?  Shake by who?  What's she doing?  I don't know.  She's just dancing.  This is it?  All right.  This is the song.  This is it?  All right.  I'll take this one.  All right.  She's wearing a fucking babushka. 
[03:58:30]  Come on with the headphones.  Oh, there she goes.  It's almost like a limbo dance.  A shimmy.  She's doing the shimmy.  And then, all right, back to the...  Scoop of the ice.  Uppercut.  Ice scoop.  Ice scoop move.  If you put on any single song, and it'll work.  Yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, now it's like...  Should you take off your pink jacket for this song?  No, my top already went down. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, your top went down.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that sucks when that happens.  I noticed that it was kind of...  When she put her hands over her head, you could see her midsection, and I was like, she had a dress on.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Yeah, crazy, right?  I guess the dress slid down when she did the shimmy.  You got it.  But she's wearing her pink...  And you go for it.  Oh, there she goes.  There you go.  Now she's been shimmying.  You do this in the bar.  You'll get everyone. 
[03:59:30]  Really?  And then...  And then back to that.  And then back to the ice scooping move.  Oh, and then she does something else.  And then you kill you in some different ways.  Oh, oh, she just did a slit or throw with her...  And now there's a gun in the mouth.  Finger gun in the mouth.  True.  You got to put on the headphones and pretend you're a listener.  You got to put on the headphones and pretend you're a listener.  Yeah.  You got to put on one more song.  Any song.  Your favorite song.  Were you putting the songs on?  Oh.  Yeah, he's putting the songs on. 
[04:00:00]  Something like Paula Rabble.  Put on your favorite song.  He rock.  I'll choose his favorite song.  Got me off in the club with the hardest...  Hot food.  If you want to make the money, try to work that shit.  Put it all off in your bag and lift you up.  So the wheels really came off this show.  No kidding.  Got hit.  Well, it's just, uh...  It's Liz's dancing.  Liz is, uh...  Liz is a little nutty.  It works!  Yeah, it works.  It works all right.  Your nuttiness works. 
[04:00:30]  I don't know what it is, but it works.  Got it wiggle, got it wiggle.  Oh.  Uh-oh, what's this move?  That's like a Watusi.  It's a little wax on, wax off sort of, huh?  Oh, now she's doing that.  Yeah, now she's...  And the legs.  And the legs, yeah.  A little, uh, MC Hammer type thing happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pose, sit this still for a second.  Like, no, no, like you're dancing.  You're mid-dance.  Ah-ha!  There you go.  There you go. 
[04:01:00]  Thank you.  I could twit you.  All right.  All right, well...  That was nice.  Thanks, guys.  That was terrific.  New Pulse is lucky to have you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was the student ambassador there, so all the people know.  Gotta come here.  By the way, there's a lot.  There's 468 Liz Craig.  Do you want to help us out a little bit?  Um, I don't know how.  Yeah.  Just get it to therealjimnorton at gmail.com.  All right, I'll do that.  All right, there goes Liz. 
[04:01:30]  Can I tweet that picture of you, dancing?  Yeah, yeah, that's cool.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm really taking this money.  Take it.  I really meant to pay you.  You actually did a gig.  For that artwork that he did?  It was amazing.  Yeah, it was beautiful.  You could keep the drawing, too.  Keep the drawing.  Let Jimmy sign it.  Yeah, I'll take that.  Fuck yeah.  That's famous now.  The fire-ass.  Fire-ass poster.  Sam, find a good place for this, for real.  She'll be back.  That's like a threat from her.  It's a threat.  I'll be back.  Let me sign it to you.  She'll be back after she follows us home.  There you go.  Why roses?  Jimmy's going to sign it. 
[04:02:00]  What?  Whose roses are these?  I don't know.  Oh.  Why do we have a...  Jay Moore gave roses to Fez, and Fez left him here?  Oh, that's nice.  Oh, they're like your roses.  They're dying.  All right.  Liz, thank you.  Oh, you guys.  Did you have fun?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Great job.  Back in the meds soon, you think?  When do you go back in the meds?  You don't want the meds?  Tonight.  No.  Tonight?  It's keeping it real.  It was just...  What, you just took a couple days off from the meds? 
[04:02:30]  I left them in my car, so there's just no way.  Yeah.  Well...  That is...  And it was just Vegas that kind of depressed me.  Yeah, you'll be all right.  Yeah.  You'll come back.  Yeah.  You'll snap out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, dancing like that and stuff.  Yeah, you know.  Fuck yeah.  It's for real, baby.  All right, there goes Liz.  Take it easy, Liz.  Liz, uh...  Her backpack full of clothes.  ...walks out the door.  Holy shit.  You know, I could tell the second she walked in, there was just a look and a thing that 
[04:03:00]  was like, this girl's... she's insane.  But, you know, thank God, it's a fun insane.  Yeah.  There is a fun insane, right?  Well, we saw the fun insane.  Mm-hmm.  See, something tells me there is an airliner full of luggage.  Sized baggage.  That, uh...  That is...  It goes along with that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So the fun crazy is all fun here. 
[04:03:30]  But something tells me maybe you're home, uh, hanging out, and when the not-fuckers...  Fun Crazy comes out, whoa, that probably gets a little crazy.  A little bit.  Like 9-1-1 crazy.  You ever have to call 9-1-1 or have anyone call 9-1-1 on you?  Only when I passed out.  Yeah.  But that wasn't from craziness.  No, that wasn't crazy.  That was...  I get a little crazy sometimes. 
[04:04:00]  A little crazy.  A little bit.  When you were in Vegas, right, what was the thing that happened, the mental breakdown?  What happened?  Because I was in my room all the time, and I had a single, and I just didn't see the  light, so I just, um, stayed in bed.  Mm.  Yeah.  You gotta get out and get some vitamin D.  From the sun.  Yeah, in the sun.  Yeah.  But you don't look like you get a lot of sun.  I know.  I went to this place, and the lady said, you're vitamin D deficient, because I'm, like, 
[04:04:30]  and I'll buy mine.  Is she a vitamin D saleswoman?  Lying sack of shift.  The sun will kill you.  You got some vitamin D around here.  Thank you.  Vitamin dick.  Oh, my.  All right.  We haven't gotten to the bottom of this list, girl.  It's obvious, so.  Oh.  It's a work in progress.  It's a bit in progress.  There's something going on there.  Oh, there's...  Unless you come back soon, all right?  I will.  There's bunches going on there we don't know about. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah, no, I will.  You know how to get here.  Yeah.  You like weird stuff in bed?  You remind me of, like, Knife Girl and stuff like that.  Like, what's the weirdest thing you do in bed?  Loony laugh.  I think there's something, like, weird.  Like, we had a girl that used to get turned on by having knives scraped on her body,  where it had to make scratches on her skin.  No, you know what?  Like, people think that I'm really crazy in bed, which is a good perception, because I'm not.  I just like to lay there and have things done to me.  Yeah.  All right, so you're a big submissive, right? 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  You like being spanked?  I can guess, I'll go for it.  Wait, but what do you mean?  If you guess, you'll go for it.  Are you a submissive or just a lazy fuck?  No, I'm pretty just lazy.  Maybe they thought she was dead.  All right.  All right, Liz.  Thank you.  Thank you, Liz, again.  They're still trying to find you on Facebook, so...  Crazy Liz.  It's like a scavenger hunt.  I'm in the New York network.  All right, look for...  And there's three pictures.  I mean, there's three people in my picture, and it's a little blurry. 
[04:06:00]  All right, look for the girl that looks very white.  Not red hair, but definitely some red highlights happening.  It's kind of a light brown hair.  Right?  I don't see that, but thanks.  Red.  How do you not see that?  I see a little bit of brown, a little bit of blonde, a little bit of...  Red.  Not like...  No, it's not red red.  Not like Carrot Top Red.  Ronald McDonald red.  I can see that, just a little shade.  A little red hue.  Highlight.  This is all natural now.  There's no dye in my hair.  Oh, come on, guys, let's not fight. 
[04:06:30]  All right, Liz.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys.  Who would you kill first in here?  Including the audience?  No.  No.  No.  That guy scares me a little.  I don't think I'd kill him, though.  Who, Kenny?  Hey, Kenny.  Oh, he's giving me the look, though.  I don't think I'd want to kill him.  Ever.  What's the look he's giving you?  I think he'd want to be my daddy. 
[04:07:00]  He'd snap your neck.  Yeah, what's the look...  What is the look Kenny's giving you?  Devil.  Like the girl on the train this morning when I fire-assed her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that called crop dusting, really?  Hmm?  Why don't we go home?  I want to go home.  Yeah.  Thank you, Liz.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  I think we're done, right?  Yes, we are.  Yes, we are.  Let's head on out. </pre>
