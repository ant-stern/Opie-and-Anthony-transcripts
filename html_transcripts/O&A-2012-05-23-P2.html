<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show featuring Sam Roberts, Bob Kelly, and Joe DeRosa began with a promotion for DeRosa's upcoming stand-up shows at Caroline's, including details about dates, ticket prices, and a military discount during Fleet Week.  The conversation then shifted to DeRosa's canceled CBS TV show, "NYC To-Do," a project involving Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal. DeRosa surprisingly expressed a degree of relief about its cancellation.  The hosts segued into a discussion about the advantages of podcasts over other social media, contrasting the dedication of podcast listeners with the more fleeting nature of Twitter followers, and touching upon the easier monetization of podcasts. This led to some playful banter about their respective Twitter follower counts.

A significant portion of the show devolved into a prolonged, humorous, and often offensive roasting of a mutual acquaintance named Travis, focusing on accusations of snobbery (illustrated with anecdotes like pinky-in-the-air tea sipping) and culminating in speculation about his sexuality.  The story of Travis missing the final episode of WCW Nitro due to his parents' divorce was also recounted.  The offensive language and homophobic jokes continued throughout this segment.

Bob Kelly then promoted his new YouTube web series, "What Are We Waiting For?", highlighting the appearance of Anthony Cumia in the first episode.  He also discussed a song he wrote about a fictional character named Troy, which prompted humorous speculation about the song's meaning and Kelly's own potential preferences.  The song was eventually played on air.  The conversation further involved jokes regarding Kelly's Instagram and the potential for selling his photos.  Kelly briefly mentioned receiving an official membership card to the Wosho Club.  Throughout the show, there was a recurring,  offensive joke about one of the hosts' alleged homosexuality.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  That's not what I do anymore.

Bob Kelly and Joe DeRosa are hanging out.  I'm stuck around to hang out with Sam.  You guys are good guys. 
[00:00:30]  Joe, you've got to be tired of talking about sucking Bailey J's cock on this show.  I can't talk about it anymore.  Every time you come in now.  I've got to talk about it live, too.  Your show's in the Caroline's tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  I wasn't even doing that.  That's hilarious.  He's only...  Tomorrow night and Sunday night.  Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday.

O-A-N-D-A when used to buy tickets online at carolines.com or reserving by phone.  212-757-4100.  Sam, I also...  Yeah?  ...have a new web series.  By the way, somebody screen calls.  We might actually take a couple phone calls on the after show since we didn't during the main show.  So...  It's called What Are We Waiting For?  Sam...  There's one. 
[00:01:30]  What'd you do?  Sam, have you ever...  What Are We Waiting For is on YouTube.  Have you ever said...  YouTube.com slash The Warner Sound.  They have a...  First episode starring Anthony Cumia.  Please watch it.  I have a TV show on CBS that...  Oh, it got canceled.  Yeah, while we were on the break...  It's terrible.  Yeah, but you were smiling about it.  I was smiling because I knew he was going to go, you know you're happy.  That's the cop show.  I was trying to make it be laughed.  Here's the deal.  That's the cop show you were talking about.  Here's the deal, Joe.  Let's just be honest.  It made you a little happy that it got fucking douched. 
[00:02:00]  It did make me happy.  Just in your heart.  A little.  Where you're like, oh, good.  What was the name of the show?  At least it was called NYC to-do.  To-do.  To-do.  To-do.  It's about a guy's making to-do list.  That would have been a better fucking name.  That would have been a better fucking name.  Today, I plan on solving crimes.  It's just sticky notes all over.  Yeah.  And that's how he solves crimes.  Yeah.  He just does to-do things and he goes, wait a minute.  I was at the grocery store getting carrots.  Do you have an alibi?  As a matter of fact, and he pulls off a post-it. 
[00:02:30]  I am NYC to-do.  It was De Niro, Jane Rosenthal, produced show, Tribeca.  Don't brag about it.  It's on CBS.  One of the networks.  Right.  No.  They call it the Crystal Network.  CBS is still around.  I know.  Not my show.  No, it's not on it.  Thanks for watching.  I didn't check it out, but I did get a text from a friend of mine who said, dude, Bob  Kelly just showed up on NYC, whatever it was, 22.  Yeah.  So that guy was watching.  And they didn't.  This is the thing, though.  We had one. 
[00:03:00]  I was in every show just a little.  You know what I mean?  Like, I come in, hey, nice shirt, fucking rookie, whatever.  How many shows were there?  There was 12.  I was in 11, and one of them was kind of, it was a massage parlor bust, and I didn't  want to go because I've been to the massage parlor.  It was like a comedy.  They really fucked around with the comedy.  It was like my favorite episode.  The director was the shit.  He let us improv some fucking fun shit.  Never to be seen by anybody.  The whole episode?  Dude, the show is gone. 
[00:03:30]  How many?  They're not going to play the rest of the episodes?  It aired four weeks.  Okay.  What happens is...  I was about to say, it could have been on 12 weeks.  Oh, I thought they were going to at least run out the season.  Dude, you know, I mean, this is what I've learned the last two years with the show, the  FX show that we wrote, and like doing this.  It is so hard, the obstacles that a show has to go through to actually get a full season  and then come back, it's fucking crazy.  It's fucking nuts.  I was talking to Louis about this.  He had like four years of failure before he finally reached this success. 
[00:04:00]  So many shows that didn't make it to pilot, almost made it to pilot, wrote a fucking show,  never even seen the light of day.  This show too, 12 episodes we shot, and it was a good show, great cast, and they fucking  douched it.  They did a mid-season replacement, and then four episodes, and they didn't get the demographic.  They had 8 million viewers, 7 million viewers, but it was all the old people from the fucking  Good Wife.  It was like 40 and up that fell asleep that were watching it. 
[00:04:30]  That's why comedians, I think, are all jumping on podcasts and trying to figure out how to make  money that way, because you don't have to worry about anything.  I think podcasts, it's not for the money, but it's also better than Twitter and Facebook.  It's a better social media, because now the people that listen to my show are fans of  me.  They're not just...  They hear your voice, you're actually doing stuff.  Yeah, because they're creating.  No, they have to go do something to get it.  Twitter, you just hit a button, you're following me.  You don't have to be really a fan of me.  You could be a fan of Jim Norton and not a fan of me, and just follow me. 
[00:05:00]  But the podcast, you actually have to go, subscribe, download, and you have to listen  to it.  And I think that's what's different, too, about radio shows.  On a radio show, you can have X number of listeners, but the vast majority of those people  are not paying attention most of the time.  Whereas with a podcast, if you're downloading it, and you're putting it on your phone, and  you're actually listening to it, most of the people are listening intently to it.  Yeah, they're a fan of yours.  So you can hit your actual fan base, whether it be... 
[00:05:30]  You know, I have 47,000 people on Twitter.  Not all 47,000 of those people are fans of mine.  Some of those people, apparently from their tweets, are fucking cunts and don't like me.  Yeah, I got 33,000 on Twitter, and not even 33 of them are fans of mine.  I don't know why they all...  I'm Danny J. Ross on Twitter, so you can come follow me anytime.  That's just a cheap Twitter plug.  I just want more followers.  How many do you have?  I never plug it, so it's like eight grand, nine grand, something like that.  I have...  I think Y...  We just got a YKWD podcast one.  On Twitter? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we have only six...  I think 600 fucking followers.  Well, it's tough to like...  Because you're promoting your own Twitter, so you can't promote two Twitters at the same  time.  But here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  If you...  Well, someone...  Whatever.  If I have 47,000 people over here, I should have 47,000 people over there.  Well, they're not going to follow you twice.  And then you're in the middle.  Not if you're tweeting like...  The same shit.  The same shit.  No, I'm not.  I'm not saying you are, but I follow you.  Somebody runs that.  I've followed people who have like two Twitter accounts, like, you know, blogs or whatever. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And like, you're just going to end up retweeting, you know what...  Right.  ...their Twitter.  So what's the point of following that Twitter?  I'm not running that one, the podcast Twitter.  That's being run.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  So it does have different shit.  I mean, if that Twitter is giving you exclusive things that you're not going to retweet, then  it's worth it.  But if it's not, then I'm just going to read it when you retweet.  It's like you and Joe, so I'm following you and Joe.  Right.  I'm not going to follow the podcast page.  I'm already following both of you.  I already gave you each a follow.  I'm not going to also give the podcast page a follow. 
[00:07:00]  You know?  If you were my friend, you would.  Well, just post it.  I follow your podcast on Twitter.  I only have one Twitter page.  I don't have like...  I created a fucking podcast Twitter account for you that I run and I follow.  That was so nice.  I didn't know you were a fan on that level.  I'm a fan.  That's really...  I'm a fan of Sam Roberts.  Thank you so much.  I just like...  Hair or no hair.  I have hair.  Yeah, but it's going.  Slowly but surely.  Oh, I can't wait until you're fucking bald.  I don't think I'm going to be bald bald.  You're going to be bald. 
[00:07:30]  And this is why you're going to be bald.  And you keep pulling your shit back into a ponytail.  You're killing your hair.  It looks ridiculous out.  It doesn't...  Trim it.  Yeah.  Do something.  Because you're killing your hair.  You're ripping it back every day.  You're pulling your own hair out.  You're making yourself bald.  I hope not.  Well, I just made that up.  I thought you were for real.  No, I just made that up.  I think so.  I thought you were for real.  That's like when people say wearing hats makes you bald.  That doesn't...  It does.  It kills the root.  You just make the shit up. 
[00:08:00]  It kills the root.  Just because you pronounce the last syllable, doesn't it?  Make it true.  Man, I am fucking so tired, dude.  Why?  I don't know.  I think I only got about three hours of sleep.  I got three hours of sleep.  I'm so tired.  I did a 40-minute, 45-minute workout last night.  I wouldn't say that on the real show.  That's the best part about the after show.  There's zero expectations for it.  So you just throw shit out.  And sometimes it's great.  And sometimes it's horrible.  I am sleepy.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  It doesn't matter.  I got to meet a realtor.  When?  You're not leaving.  Where are you going?  At 11 or 12.  I'm waiting to hear back from the guy.  Go for 12.  Well, we'll go for 12.  Well, I think I'm meeting two different guys here.  Well, listen, man.  Were you trying to get out of here?  No.  Without being a snob like Travis?  You find Travis to be a snob?  No.  What?  You don't have to bring it up again.  What?  Not again.  No.  I mean, Bob's brought it up on previous after shows.  You find Travis to be a snob?  I think his Twitter should be at Snob Trav.  Snob Trav. 
[00:09:00]  Trav Snob sounds better.  Maybe I'll change my Twitter name to that.  I like Trav Snob Trav.  Snob Trav?  Snob Trav.  Why do you think Travis is a snob?  Because he is.  In what way?  Because, first of all, he sips with his pinky out.  You do that shit?  No, never.  That's only because he's gay.  I don't know what he's talking about.  He's gay?  That's more of a gay thing than a snob thing.  Are you gay?  No.  Are you, like, legitimately gay?  Oh, no.  Not legitimately.  Oh, okay.  Him and Danny, like, we've talked about this before, but they touch a lot, like, more  than it's comfortable for anyone.  Danny touches me.  And you touch him.  I don't touch just anybody. 
[00:09:30]  I'm not fucking giving you massages, little faggot boy.  Danny, oh.  I don't know.  Little faggot boy.  Yeah, am I gay for not being touched by you?  Yeah, you should.  It feels good.  I'm not sucking your dick, faggot.  Exactly.  I'm sucking Travis dick.  That's right.  But you think Travis is a little bit of a snob.  He is a fucking snob.  First of all, I point, there was a photo on the paper today.  It was just a crazy photo.  I don't know if it was a light of some shit.  I go, what's that?  It was a rocket ship.  It's a paper.  I definitely didn't say it like that. 
[00:10:00]  But you knew that.  It was a newspaper.  That's a newspaper, Bob.  I didn't point to the computer screen with a photo of a fucking spaceship on it.  What's that?  You think I'm really pointing to the, like, I'm asking if it's a computer?  You fucking idiot.  Why wouldn't you treat the guest with a little more respect?  Yeah, why?  Because he's a snob.  It's not out of disrespect.  It's his upbringing in an elite society.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, he's a snob.  He's a fucking snob.  An elite society.  I lived in a closet for two years in Brooklyn.  I guarantee you were in the closet for the last two years. 
[00:10:30]  Look, he left his family.  He left his elite family, too.  No, his mom left family, for the record.  She ran off with a Jewish guy.  What happened?  She made him miss the last episode of Nitro, and then she ran off with a Jewish guy.  I've never heard of that.  By the way, it's Sam's favorite story of mine.  Yeah.  Until we're no longer friends, is the fact that my parents told me that they were getting divorced on the night. 
[00:11:00]  Well, because listen, it was when WWE and WCW were merging and everything, and it was this big deal, right?  And so Travis, Joe's going to do his thing.  He'll come back.  He's fine.  He's tired.  Let him be.  No, I got an email about something we were talking about.  Joe already set it up.  He's tired.  He's fine.  I got an email called, and the subject is the gay thing.  But listen, so Travis is going home, and he's all excited about this episode.  He's going to watch it, and he's going to get his snacks.  He went out and bought his snacks and prepared and everything, and he's getting ready. 
[00:11:30]  It starts at 8 p.m., right?  And so he's coming home.  He's on time.  He's like, yeah, I'm going to sit down and watch three hours of wrestling.  It's going to be the best thing ever.  7.50 I walked in the door.  7.50 he walks in.  He's on time.  He's ready to go.  And his parents say, Travis, can we come talk to you for a second?  And he goes, yeah, sure.  And they sit him down, and he's like, I hope this is quick, though, because it's five minutes  until wrestling.  And he sits down, and they go, we're getting divorced.  And he missed his wrestling.  I never saw it yet.  Because his parents were getting divorced. 
[00:12:00]  It was the final episode?  Yeah.  That was it for Nitro.  That was absolutely the final episode ever.  And then his mom, in the night, out of nowhere, with no warning, runs off with some Jewish  guy and never talks to him again.  What does the Jewish part have to do with it?  He was Jewish.  That was his religion.  Sam's just detailed.  If he was a Buddhist, I'm sure that would have come up in the description as well.  What if he was Catholic?  Well, no.  Rattled with some crazy Catholic guy.  So is that when you became a snob? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, that's exactly when.  I'm going to be better than other people.  I'm never going to treat people the way I was treated.  You figured it out.  He put up this wall at that point where he was protecting himself.  A wall of snobbery?  A wall of snobbishness.  Yeah.  I guarantee you.  That's why he became Snob Trav.  Can I just say something?  Snob Trav.  He has turtlenecks at his house with his initials embroidered on it.  But he can't fit into it anymore.  Oh.  He has gained some weight.  He's put on some of that sympathy pregnancy weight, and then he didn't lose it. 
[00:13:00]  I put on a lot of stop-smoking weight.  Did you quit smoking?  I quit smoking like three years ago.  Oops.  Oops.  Oops.  What?  Oopsie-daisy.  Oopsie-daisy.  I'll tell you, I got nine months from me, kid.  Yeah?  Off of cigarettes.  Yep.  Does it feel good?  You feel healthy?  This time.  What?  I said this time.  Why would you say that?  What a snob!  What a fucking asshole!  Only a snob would say that.  What a snob trap!  Snob trap.  That was more of an asshole thing to say.  No, that's a snob trap.  If it was coming from Danny, Danny would be an asshole, because that would be like, 
[00:13:30]  yeah, you're fucking this time.  But Travis was very much like, well, I quit, and I'm better than you.  Three years ago, and then he went, this time.  Right.  You know what I mean?  He had that thirst and howl bullshit.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Like, you look like he would wear an ascot when he said that.  Yeah, which is a classic accoutrement.  That's right.  I like it.  It's right.  Yeah, dude, he should have an ascot.  You should.  Snob trap should have an ascot.  Of course. 
[00:14:00]  And a monocle.  Yeah, a monocle.  And he walks around in a smoking jacket.  He should have a little, you know, he should have a vest with two little pockets.  One for his pocket watch.  Yeah.  And he flips out and looks at the time.  And when people go, excuse me, you know the time, he acts.  He goes, get a watch.  And he flips it out.  And then the monocle.  Yes, I have the time.  Yeah, and he has glasses that have the magnet in the middle that he opens and separates.  Of course he does.  That he just hangs on his neck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're a snob trap.  You're a snob trap.  Anyway, you quit smoking.  Good for you. 
[00:14:30]  Anyway.  Anyway.  Good for you.  As we were saying.  As we were saying, that's a paper.  I can see how this snob character quickly devolves into me being gay.  Well, you are gay.  That's at the top of everything we do about you.  Yeah.  That's at the top of everything we do about everyone here.  But mainly you, though.  Yeah.  And it's just like everybody knows.  It's like if we called Eric Snob Eric.  It'd be like, yeah, he happens to also be a fat snob.  I'm like, yes, that's already established.  Yeah.  Listen, anything that has to do with you has gay in it.  Right. 
[00:15:00]  That's an ingredient we can't leave out with you.  It's like saying, yes, you're a snob who has a beard.  You're a snob who is gay.  Yeah.  That's like making ice cream without milk.  Right.  Right.  It's already established.  A dash of fag to have a Trav.  Well, that's not Trav.  A dash of mmm.  A dash of I want to marry Tyler Moore coat.  Do you want to throw your hat in the air?  Yeah, he's the only one that leaves the house.  I need an umbrella.  He does that when he walks out of the building?  Definitely.  Catches it. 
[00:15:30]  I guarantee he has fucking like three different size umbrellas for, you know, different situations.  Do you have three different size umbrellas?  What kind of situations?  Like, I don't know, if you're going to run out of the house, but you have a hoodie on,  you want to take a little umbrella, but then you have the medium umbrella, but then you  have the really super duper umbrella if you're going to be walking a little bit, you know,  looking at shops on the upper east side.  In case he's going to be window shopping.  I never go in.  No, you go in.  You talk to the people.  They know you.  Because you know what you're talking about when it comes to fucking crystal. 
[00:16:00]  Oh!  Snobdrav, what are you here for today?  Just browsing.  Do you have chandelier in it?  I'm looking for a mini chandelier for my bathroom.  I have a pedestal sink, I'm thinking of getting it.  Do you have a pedestal sink?  I would be snobdrav in a minute, based on how you guys think I live.  Don't stutter, you cocksucker.  Exactly.  He tried being straight for a second.  He couldn't keep himself together.  Hey, even DeRosa thinks you're a fucking homo. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, he wants a dick in his mouth.  DeRosa's so tired, he's just giggling.  I don't even know if he hears us.  I got nothing.  He has no headphones on.  I got absolutely nothing, man.  Do the ONA fans show up?  I'm fucking dying right now.  Making Bailey J references yet at your gigs?  All the time.  Dude, when I say it, when I go, I mean, it's a lot of it's from Bobby's.  It's probably more so from Bobby's podcast.  Yeah, that's where it all started.  Whoa!  No, no, I don't mean...  What podcast is that, though?  You know what, dude?  On the Riotcast network. 
[00:17:00]  You mean millions?  And millions!  He's just finishing each other's sentence.  They love each other.  But it started there, so that's where a lot of it comes from.  But yeah, ONA guys, too.  Like, it's like, it's, you know...  Sometimes when I go into the bit, I'll go...  Because I started and I go, I had the privilege this...  I became friends with a porn star, finally.  And I go, this year I met and became friends with a porn star.  And she's the hottest girl I've ever known.  Her name's Bailey J.  Woo!  And then, yeah, a couple people will always go... 
[00:17:30]  Oh, and I!  And then a couple people, by the end of it, are mortified.  Yeah, they don't know what you're going to say.  I was at the Apple store up in New Jersey at Paramus.  And, you know, there was some fans, you know, ONA or you-know-what, dude.  You know, they're fucking the same people.  But they were like, hey, Bob, whatever.  It's like four dudes.  It's like regular Apple dudes with the Apple shirt.  And they were like, dude, I really want to thank you, man.  We'll fucking love Bailey J., man.  She's so hot. 
[00:18:00]  What does she do to guys?  Dude, I was like...  And she doesn't, though.  She doesn't fuck guys on film.  That's the thing.  She drives men crazy.  She does, yeah.  You're going to say goodbye?  You're going to say goodbye?  Wait.  I'm throwing something away.  Oh, Eric.  You put your bag on and you walk towards the door.  Does Eric have my Troy song?  It's been on.  Eric, do you have the Troy song that Bob recorded yesterday?  Not in the lead, no.  I told you to isolate it.  You said...  He fucking told you.  Should we play this on the after show?  And you were like... 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  And I was like, yeah, we could play it.  I didn't know you really wanted it.  I haven't.  Apparently, when you really want something, what do you say?  Yes.  What do you say when you kind of want something?  Like, what'd you say to him?  And he was like, should we get this?  I was thinking we could pull it for the after show.  I was like, okay, yeah, that would work.  What would you do if you really wanted to do it, if you said that?  I'd probably be like, yeah, that would definitely work.  It's not that much different.  You just had to work.  How many callers...  See, if you get a lot of callers that want to hear the Troy song...  We don't have that much time left.  I doubt that he'll be able to pull it out on time. 
[00:19:00]  I have faith in Eric.  Eric's fucking...  Yeah, Eric's really fucking unbelievable.  It might not be that good.  We should give him some shot to actually add some music to it.  Oh, you know what?  Let the fans hear it and let them do it.  Let them do something.  A little contest for the listeners?  I just got into a fucking snob trap room.  I'm...  Oh, my...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  God.  Snob trap.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Heavens to Betsy.  You know, Roland, when the office is empty, Roland goes... 
[00:19:30]  Once Travis leaves, he goes over to Travis's phone, and he just starts dialing random extensions  of people who work here and does an over-the-top gay voice.  He goes, hi, this is Travis.  And he just does it for, like, an hour.  I would just start calling people and saying...  Like, he'll call the front desk receptionist, and he'll be like, hey, what's the weather  outside?  You look faboo.  He says that.  Faboo is his big word.  He says, oh, that's faboo.  And then he calls the front desk, and he'll be like, hi, this is Travis from O&A. 
[00:20:00]  What time is it?  Yeah, but at the same time, it's Roland, so you have no idea what he's saying.  Oh, you're just like, what the fuck just happened?  I hope somebody right now gets at SnobTrap on Twitter.  It's gone.  It starts tweeting SnobTrap.  It's a paper, Bobby.  It's a paper.  Faboo.  This is going to become like a hipster aerial meme really, really quickly.  I hope someone posts that on the Facebook page.  I got my fucking membership card from the Wosho Club. 
[00:20:30]  The what?  What's that?  Have we talked about that?  The Wosho Club?  It's the Millionaire's Club in Virginia City in the 1850s.  Oh, right.  They actually sent me my official membership card.  Do you have it on you?  You know what they sent in the thing?  What?  It was the card.  My name.  That's a sucker.  My name on it.  And then it had a piece of yellow paper folded around it and handwritten. 
[00:21:00]  It said, thank you.  They have time to write out all those thank yous?  Yeah, they just wrote, thank you.  I'm a member.  20 bucks.  Exactly.  Get it.  Get it.  Are we going to go ghost hunting?  You've got to get your membership.  You've got to go to the Wosho Club.com.  20 dollars.  Fucking Bobby Kelly set up Wosho Club.com with a PayPal button.  I wish, dude.  Did you hear Ants smashing you for selling your Instagram photos?  I haven't sold one. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, obviously.  Maybe I have.  I don't know.  Nobody should buy your Instagram photos.  That's like...  Dude, I did the Instacamp when that came out.  You understand, though, I try every app.  I try it all just to see what it's like.  I'm the one who originally had Instagram before any of you fucking losers.  That's not true.  Yeah, that's not true.  That's not true at all.  Absolutely.  Fuck you.  Before fuck you.  Isn't there some stuff that you shouldn't sell a long time ago?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Snobtrap.  Isn't there some stuff that you shouldn't be selling? 
[00:22:00]  Like, you don't need to sell everything to your fans.  If you want a photo, you can have it.  Yeah, but you're like, hey, check this out.  You can buy more stuff from me.  Yeah, you can have it.  Like, doesn't it get to a point where it's like, all right, with the selling stuff.  Dude, what do you think, I'm fucking a Lamborghini?  I'm not fucking ShamWow.  What do you mean you have to sell $30 Instagram photos?  I don't make any money off of it.  You don't make shit money off of it.  So what are you doing it for?  If they want one of those photos, they can have it.  They can have it.  You should make people save their money for your shows and stuff like that. 
[00:22:30]  What do you want me to do?  Not sell Instagram photos.  Do you want me to fucking make it a canvas myself and give it to people?  Don't sell Instagram photos.  I just joined it.  You don't have to buy it.  All right.  When did you join, Bobby?  I didn't know you could buy those.  Hang on.  We only got a couple minutes.  You want to hear your song?  Yeah, this new company came out, Instacampus.  You can, they just don't buy any of the photos.  Eric, play the song.  What is the song that you sing in your head?  If you were going to, Troy was going to have a song.  This would be the song.  I like gay things, but I'm not gay. 
[00:23:00]  I like walks in the park, feeding the birds, going to zoos.  Checking, making sure my ass is clean after poos.  I like gay things, but I'm not a gay man.  My name is Troy, my name is Troy. 
[00:23:30]  I got tattoos, but not of angry things, of fishes and birds and flowers of spring.  I'm not a gay man, but I like gay things.  I'm Troy, I'm Troy, I'm Troy, yeah.  You should really get into musical theater, I think.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:24:00]  Broadway is the next stop.  Enough of this nonsense CBS bullshit.  I come up with some good songs on this fucking show.  Is that what you think is going on in Troy's head?  That's true.  That's what's in Troy's head all the time.  He was so proud of that song.  He mentioned, he's like, can you make sure you pull that song?  And then today, he's like, did you get the song?  Did you get the song?  And everybody liked it, yeah.  That's why.  Is that how you feel?  Like, you're kind of just like a guy who likes gay things, but he's not gay.  He's not gay.  He was just trying to bust up me for having a Morrissey record in my studio.  That's like a gay thing.  No, no.  Troy is not gay. 
[00:24:30]  No.  He likes gay things.  Right.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Nobody, we're asking you if that's how you think you are.  You always gotta argue.  Don't be defensive.  But why does it always have to be a gay thing?  It's something gay people like.  Like, sucking cock is gay.  I don't like that.  Hey, hey, hey.  But liking a certain kind of music, that is not gay.  Troy, don't be offensive to people, all right?  Sucking cock is fair.  Yeah, we have a dick sucker in the room, okay?  You have a fucking daisy tattoo on your elbow.  No, it's actually a lotus flower.  It's not a star like fucking Pauly D, like a man one.  Right.  Why is that? 
[00:25:00]  That's just trendy and faggy.  Troy, stop being such a bitch.  You've been argumentative.  I just like arguing.  You know that.  He's joking.  No, I know.  Who's snob trap in this fucking situation?  Oh, yeah, of course he's got a tattoo.  He's on his iPhone.  What else is new?  I'm checking the stocks because I have things that go up and down.  What?  No.  Do you think you like gay things?  Yeah, I like a lot of gay things.  All right.  So what are you arguing for?  Like, Morrissey.  And what else?  So you just said for a minute ago, Morrissey's not gay.  Well, he is gay.  He's not gay. 
[00:25:30]  But liking Morrissey's not gay.  He's never confirmed that he's gay.  Joe, stop sticking up for your fucking never confirmed gay people.  Technically, Joe, you've never confirmed your gay either.  I'm not.  Sure, whatever.  We're moving on from that.  I'm not.  Look, if I say, hey.  You tried to swallow virtual cum today off the computer screen.  I thought Bobby was taping me.  All right, that's worse.  I did it for the camera.  If you have to scream, gay for pay.  Joe is a third-party gay porno stock. 
[00:26:00]  If you have to scream on the radio, I'm not gay, you're gay.  All right.  I'm not gay.  I'm not gay.  We're out of time.
